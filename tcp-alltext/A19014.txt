THE THIRD BOOKE OF AMADIS DE GAVLE
               
                  Contayning the diſcords and warres which befell in Great Brittaine and there about, occaſioned by the bad councell, which King Liſuart receiued from Gandandell and Brocadan, againſt Amadis and his followers: whereby, many good Knights (afterward, on either ſide) cruelly concluded their liues.
               
               
                  CHAP. I.
                  
                     THE ſonnes of Gandandell and Brocadan, being (as you haue formerly heard) ouercome, the Knights of the Encloſed Iſland came to ſeeke Angriote and his Nephew and (with great ioy) conducted them into their Pauillions. But King Liſuart (ſome ſmall while before this victorie) had with-drawne himſelfe into his Chamber; not for any good that he wiſhed to the vanquiſhed, knowing alreadie the Treaſon of their wicked Fathers: but becauſe hee would behold nothing, that might redound to the glorie of Amadis, whom hee held in ſo great hatred, as to let him the more familliarly vnderſtand it: he would hardly admit leiſure to the two Conquerors, to haue their wounds reſpected. But very haſtily ſent commaund vnto them, that they ſhould depart out of his Country, neuer preſuming afterward to enter it againe, leaſt they would haue worſe welcome then ſtood with their liking, whichnewes were ſo diſpleaſing to them, that inſtantly they complayned to D
                           •
                        n Grumedan, Brian de Moniaſte, and other Gentlemen, who often vſed to viſite them. And to them they ſaid, that ſeeing the King (forgetting the
                        •
                      former ſeruices done vnto him) held his fauours ſo far off, and in ſuch ſtrange manner from them: that himſelfe likewiſe ſhould not count it ſtrange (hauing thus forſaken them) if they ſought to diſpleaſe him to their vtmoſt power. Suddenly therefore arming themſelues, and mounting on horſe-backe, both they and their companions rode toward the Encloſed Iſland, and the third day following, arriued at an Hermitage, where they found the Neece to Brocadan, the friend of Sarquiles, by whoſe meanes the treaſon had beene before diſcouered: and becauſe her Vncle had threatned her, ſhee ſecretly abſented her ſelfe from the Court, when

beholding Sarquiles, ſhee came and embraced him, and preuailed ſo fairelie with her, as to leade her along with them.
                  But you muſt vnderſtand, that ſoone after Angriote and his aſſociates were departed; Grumedan (who had beene their Conductor) 
                        〈◊〉
                      to King Liſuart, and acquainted him with all that he had heard of Angriote: whereon when hee had long conſidered, he thus anſwered.
                  
                     I know right well, that patience is a vertue highly to bee commended, and beneficiall: Neuertheleſſe, often times of a ſlender euill, it begetteth a moſt mightie ruine. For proofe where of, if I had (at the firſt) ſhewen ſuch countenance to Agriote & the reſt, as I ſhould haue done, and not entertained them ſo kindely as I haue done: it may bee they had neuer entred into ſuch boldneſſe, not onely to vſe threatnings againſt me, but alſo to enter my Country ſo preuily. Notwithſtanding, hauing done according as reaſon perſwaded me, God (with his owne good liking) will allow it, and it will (no doubt) redound wholly to my honour, and their confuſion, which that it may bee the better knowne vnto them, it is my will (without any longer temporizing) to ſend defiance to them, and eſpecially to Amadis, who is the onely Authour of all this euill; and ſo much the rather, that by the very ſame meanes their pride may be chaſtiſed.
                  
                  At this very inſtant, Arban, King of North-wales, one of the wiſeſt and moſt vertuous Princes in all the Land, was there preſent, who looking with diſcretion on this ſodaine enterpriſe in the King, ſpake thus vnto him.
                  
                     Sir, I am of the minde, that (before you doe what you haue intended) you would vſe the aduiſe of the chiefeſt men in your Kingdome, for you doe very well know, that Amadis and they of his line, are good and valiant Knights, admired for their power, and not neglected by their friends. Moreouer, there is no man ignorant, how falſely they haue beene accuſed to your Maieſtie, as the victorie which Angriote and Sarquiles enioyed ſo lately againſt the ac
                           •…
                        , hath deliuered ſufficient teſtimony for, had not right and truth ſupported their cauſe, although they are good and approued Knights indeed: yet could they not ſo eaſily haue gone cleere from the ſoones of Gandandell, nor of Damas, whereby ſufficiently appeareth, that the hand of heauen was powerfull in maintayning their iuſtification. And therefore Sir, were you ſo pleaſed, as to forget your concerned diſpleaſure gone out againſt them, and make a repeale of them to your ſeruice: in my poore opinion it would be for the beſt, conſidering, it hath neuer paſt with any honourable allowance, that a King ſhould warre with them, whom hee may eaſily, and with his no meane dignitie, commaund to yeeld him both loue and ſeruice: whereas in doing otherwiſe, oft times it prooueth to the loſſe of his people, extreame expences, and weakening his authoritie, a matter ſo daungerous, as (vpon ſuch aduantage) inciteth neighbouring Commanders, to thirſt in deſire o nouell attempts, to hurle off awe and ſubiection, and to winne more libertie then they could formerly aime at. And therefore, a wiſe Prince, if poſſible it may be, ſhould neuer giue occaſion to his ſubiects, to runne from that feare and reuerence which in duty they owe vnto him: but rather ought to eſſay by all meanes, that his gouernment may relliſh of temperate diſcretion, winning their hearts and willes rather by cordiall louc, then the leaſt ſauour of vigour and tyrannie, as a faithfull Sh

                        fter an errour is perfectly knowen, the remedy falls out to be too farre off. Amadis is ſo humble minded, and ſo much yours; as if you but ſend to recall him, you may quickly haue him, and all they that follow him, of whom you may diſpoſe to be much better ſerued, then euer you haue beene.
                  
                  I know well (replled the King) that your aduiſe is verie good, but they vrged mee with ſuch a demaunde, as lay not in my power to grant them, hauing made promiſe thereof before to my daughter Leonora. And I know withall, that their ſtrength is no way equall to mine, wherefore, forbeare to proceed herein with me any further, but prepare you and the reſt to keepe mee company: for to morrow, Cendill de Ganote, ſhall goe to defie them all in the Encloſed Iſland.
                  
                  You may doe as ſeemeth beſt to your Maieſtie, anſwered King Arban, who perceiuing the Kings anger to be highly prouoked, would conteſt with him no longer: but without any ſhew of diſcontentment, retired into his owne lodging. But you muſt vnderſtand, that Gandandell and Brocadan, perceiuing their Treaſon to be ſo apparrantly publiſhed by the death of their ſonnes, and waxing weary of liuing any longer among people of vertue and honeſtie: cauſed the dead bodies to be had thence, and afterward, they and their adherents embarked themſelues in a Shippe, and ſayling away, arriued in a ſmall Iſland, where they finiſhed the remainder of their wretched lines, wherefore our Hiſtory will make no more mention of them.
                  Let vs now returne to King Liſuart, who, after hee had a long while conſidered on the meſſage ſent him by Angriote, and what ſpeeches had beene vrged to him by King Arban: ſummoned a great companie of his Knights together, and began a heauie complaint vnto them, concerning Amadis and his followers, declaring the bold ſpeeches and inſolent tearmes, which Angriote had ſent him by Grumedan. Wherefore, my louing friends (quoth he) I pray yee to counſell me, how I ſhall gouerne myſelfe in this caſe. For if I endure this iniurie, it will redound no leſſe to your diſhonour, then mine owne diſaduantage: conſidering, that a Prince cannot bee wronged, without great blame to the Subiects, if they ſuffer it, and vſe no defence againſt it.
                  Hereupon, warre was concluded againſt Amadis and his allies, and inſtantly he called Condill de Ganote, ſaying thus vnto him. Goe to the Encloſed Iſland, where you ſhall finde Amadis, and tell him, that hence forward neither he nor any of his friēds may attempt the boldneſſe (vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer) to enter my Countries: for if any of them may be taken there, I ſhall in ſuch ſort beſtow them, as they will hardly eſcape agine with eaſe. Furthermore make this addition, that I doe defie them, and let them reſt aſſuredly perſwaded, that I will be their vtter deſtruction both in body and goods, whereſoeuer I can meete with them. And becauſe they make vaunt of ayding Galuanes againſt me: I am determined to goe in perſon, and will take poſſeſſion of the Iſle Mongaza, whether if they dare perſume to come, I will cauſe them to be ſurprized and hanged.
                  In this manner departed Cendill de Ganote, and the ſame day the King diſlodged, to ſoiourne in the Citie of Gracedonia, and there alſo to aſſemble his Army: whereof Oriana was moſt ioyfull, knowing the time of her de-

                     Sir, replyed Gandales, here is Sadamon, who hath charge from all the Knights now abiding in the Encloſed Iſland, to acquaint you with their ioynt deliberation. As concerning my ſelfe, I am ſent particularly to you, as I ſhall make knowen to you from my Lord Amadis, if it may pleaſe you to let me haue a ſight of your Queene, as one that deſireth to doe her moſt humble ſeruice, and to your ſelfe, mine honor reſerued.

                  This report was ſo dreadfull to the Count Latin and all his followers, that they intended to turne backe, and flie into the mountaines: but conſidering at length, that they might ſaue themſelues by the Port, kept yet purpoſely for them, and ſo fall to ſome compoſition with their enemies; they reſolued on that courſe, and made their retreate. Whereupon, Galuanes would not purſue them any further, but cauſed his people to draw backe, attending till the reſt of the army might bee ſafely landed. And as hee was taking order for his campe, a Knight came to him, being ſent from Dandaſide, to aduertiſe him, that (without all further queſtion) he and his ſhould bee Lords of the towne and Caſtle, if they pleaſed to come with their imedeat ſuccour. For the Count and his troupes held no more but one ſillie Port, where they contended to recouer what they had loſt, and might eaſily bee diſpoſed of at his pleaſure.

Beleeue me Sir (anſwered Gandales) I ſpake with them both, & for ought I could perceiue, they beare you very kinde affection: eſpecially the Queene, who deſires you (by all poſſible meanes) to make your peace with the King. Then preſenting him the Letter which Mabila had written, he further ſaid. Madame Oriana, and your Couſine Mabila commend them-ſelues very louingly to you, and are much grieued, at the hard opinion the King holds of you, and Madame Oriana praies yee, to remember what kindneſſe and reſpect you ſome times found in the Court of the King her father, and the Letter ſent yee by your Couſine, will acquaint yee more at large with other tidings.
                  Then Amadis turning his backe on Gandales, doubting the alteration of his countenance, opened the Letter, and ſaw that his linage encreaſed, Oriana being ſo neere the time of child-birth, then which, nothing could more content him. Notwithſtanding, his enforced abſence from her, bred in him ſuch extremity of affliction, as his ſpirits forſooke their ordinary functions, and cauſed him to ſend foorth ſighes in ſtead of words. Hereupon, hee purpoſed to goe viſite his father King Perion, and paſſe into Gaule: commanding Gandalin to prouide ſhipping for him, for on the morrow he would away in the company of Brunco. Gandalin very diligently fulfilled his charge, ſo that the day following they ſet to ſea, with a proſperous gale at the beginning: but at length it grew ſo tempeſtuous and turbulent, that they were throwen vpon an Iſland, which appeared very pleaſing to them, by the plentie of goodly trees therein planted. And becauſe they were much wearied with long being at ſea, Bruneo ſaid to Amadis: Behold Sir, here is a pleaſant reſting place, after our tedious trauaile, if

you like thereof ſo well as I do, and perhaps wee may meete with ſome aduentures.
                  I am well content, anſwered Amadis, and commanded the Patrone to make to the land. Marie God defend ye (quoth he) from ſo great an euill. And why? quoth Amadis. Becauſe ye are but dead men, replyed the Patrone, if you take landing heere, for this is the Sad Iſle, where the cruell Gyant Madraque liueth, who is the bloodieſt Tyrant in all the Iſles about this Sea: and let me tellyce, that for the ſpace of fifteene yeares, neither knight or damoſell, hath entred heere, but either they ſuffered a piteous death, or elſe were detayned in ſhamefull impriſonment. When Amadis and Bruneo heard this, it was no meane motiue to enflame courage in them, their maine deſire ayming at the deſtruction of ſuch damnable cuſtomes: and therefore they ſaid to the Patrone, that he ſhould take no care for landing them there, which if hee would not willingly yeeld to, they meant to enforce it. So arming themſelues, and mounting on horſeback, without any other company then their Squires Gandalin and Salinde, they rode on into the Iſle, giuing them charge, that if they chanced to be aſſayled by any other then knights, they ſhould aſſiſt them to their power.
                  So long they iourneyed, til comming vpon a plain, they diſcouered a Caſtell, which appeared to them very faire and goodly, and directing their courſe thither, they heard a horne ſo ſtrongly winded, that the whole Iſle made report thereof. I remember, quoth Bruneo, that the Patrone of the Ship told vs, when ſuch a horne ſounded, the Gyant went abroad from his fortreſſe, to fight with ſuch as his people could not conquer, and his fury is often times ſo extreame, that euery man dieth he can meete with all, yea, and his owne followers may not eſcape him.
                  Let vs on then, ſaid Amadis, to finde out this deuill; and they had not gone any great way of ground, but they heard a great noiſe of men, and blowes betweene them, which cauſed their greater haſte, to defend any that were iniuriouſly aſſayled. At laſt they eſpyed two knights very violently purſued by a great number of horſemen, but on foote were they thus cruelly oppreſſed, very neere breathleſſe: for their horſes had beene ſlaine vnder them, and yet they defended themſelues couragiouſly. Now, as they approched neerer to them, Ardan the dwarfe, knew Amadis by his Shield, whereupon he cryed out aloud: Ah my Lord, helpe your brother Galaor and the King Cildadan his intimate friend. Amadis and Bruneo aſtoniſhed at theſe newes, without returning any anſwer to Ardan, put ſpurs to their horſes in their reſcue. But inſtantly they eſpied Madraque making towards them, mounted on a, great blacke horſe, very thick couered ouer with plates of yron. In his hand hee held a Speare of ſuch weight, as hardly could any knight lift it vp from the ground. Threatning his owne men, he ſaid: Ye vile dogges, are ye ſo many, and can yee not foyle two poore tyred knights? Giue place ye Catiues, and let mee delight my ſelfe with ſluicing the blood out of their bodies.
                  
                     Amadis ſeeing him make towards his brother and the King Cildadan, with more then an ordinary kind of furie, and doubting their ability of reſiſtance, ſaid to Bruneo. Louing companion, ſuccour you my Brother, and let me alone to encounter

which vnfortunately tooke the thigh of Bruneo, and paſſing quite thorow, brake afterward in pieces againſt the Orelope. And ſo vehemently did ſhe labour in ſending more Darts to them, that her feete ſlipping, ſhee fell downe from the Rocke into the ſea, making ſuch a dreadfull noiſe in her fall, as if ſome huge Tower had beene battered in pieces, they in the ſhippe verily ſuppoſing hee had beene drowned. But afterward, they beheld her to ſwim ſo nimbly, and to cut through the waues with ſuch agility, that no fiſh could performe it more actiuely: but out of the ſhippe they let flie Arrowes at her, and wounded her in three ſeuerall places. All which notwithſtanding, ſo ſoone as ſhe recouered landing; ſhe fled ſo ſwiftly among the thickets, as if the diuell had borne her on his wings, or a whirle-winde hurried her away.
                  Shee was couered with the skin of a blacke Beare, and appeared ſo hideous and dreadfull to behold that ſhee might eaſily haue beene reputed ſome maine monſter, or diabolic

Now, becauſe Bruneo loſt much bloud by this vnhappie hurt, they committed him to the Chirurgions care and attendance, who opening the wound to ſee the daunger thereof: the Gyanteſſe ſhewed her ſelfe againe aloft on the Rocke, crying to them with a loude voyce, You damned dogges, doe yee thinke me to be a diuell, that yee make ſuch croſſing ſignes? No, no, I am Andadone, who will doe yee all the miſchiefe I can, not ſparing all poſſible paine & trauaile to performe it. They ſhooting two or three Arrowes more at her, ſhe ran ouer-thwart the Iſland, and ſo they all loſt ſight of her. But if Bruneo had not beene ſo ill, they would haue purſued her, and taken her, if they poſſibly could, to haue puniſhed her as ſhe well deſerued: but fearing leaſt w

                     th. And had not I made conqueſt of it for King Liſuart, I would haue gone my ſelfe in perſon: but I much rather deſire to viſite Gaule, hauing no hope at all of ſeeing his Court any more.
                  It greatly grieued Galaor to heare theſe newes, conſidering what harme might enſue thereby in time: And on the other ſide, hee had continually beene ſo affected to the ſeruice of King Liſuart, as hee could not forſake him, notwithſtanding his loue to Amadis, or any other, and being vnable to conceiue, what ſhould mooue him thus to eſtrange himſelfe, from the place he ſometime ſo highly eſteemed; hee deſired to vnderſtand the cauſe.

Brother, anſwered Amadis, you may well think I doe it vpon vrgent occaſion, and I would to God I could no more remember it, ſeeing the thought thereof is death to me, and therefore (I pray yee) ſpare any further ſpeech in this caſe. Where-to Galaor gladly yeelded, and finding diſcourſe on contrary matters, they arriued at Monſtrel, where they went on ſhoare, becauſe they vnderſtood that King Perion ſoiourned there, for it was the neereſt Towne that he had in Great Brittaine, and there he made expreſſely his aboad, to heare tidings of his Sonnes Amadis and Galaor.
                  
                  No ſooner did hee behold the Ship put into the Port, but hee ſent to know who were in it, and the Meſſenger deliuering his errand to Amadis, was anſwered, that King Cildadan and Bruneo were come thither, onely to doe their duty to the King, who was not a little ioyfull of the newes, hoping that they would informe him, in what he further deſired. So mounting on horſeback, they rode on to the Court: but Amadis and Galaor went another way, for they deſired firſt to ſee their mother, to trye if ſhee would acknowledge them, or no. So, as the King came forth of the Towne, they entred the Caſtell, where they met an Eſquire, to whom they ſaid. Friend, we would intreate (if you were ſo pleaſed) to acquaint the Queene, that two knights of her kinred, deſire to doe her reuerence, and to ſee her. The Squire was quick in deliuering the meſſage, and brought them anſwere, that they might enter. Heere you muſt obſerue, that the had not ſeene Galaor, ſince ſuch time as hee was carried away by the Gyant, being then but two yeares old. Neuertheleſſe, ſo ſoone as they came before her, beholding Amadis; inſtantly ſhe preſumed the other to be Galaor, and was ſo rapt with extremity of ioy, that as ſhee was about to embrace them, ſhe fell forward on them, as entraunced, being vnable (a long while) to ſpeak vnto them, at laſt ſhe ſaid. Ah bleſſed Virgin Mary, what do I behold? deare ioyes, hath Heauen ſo fauoured mee, as to let mee ſee you both together. So ſhe ſwouned againe betweene their armes, but ſhee was quickly recouered by her Ladies, and then came to Melicia, who had no meane part in this nouell ioy.
                  Thus the Queene had now her three children with her, and called to mind her paſſed misfortunes, not onely in reſpect of Amadis, but alſo of Galaor, the one eſcaping the dreadfull ſhipwrack on the Sea, the other from the hands of the Gyant Albadan: and now, what with ſorrow paſt, and ioy in preſence, ſo ſtrong a warre fought with her affections, that her chearefull countenance became quite changed. Notwithſtanding, after ſhe had recouered her ſpirits, and ſome ordinary diſcourſe paſt betweene them; ſhee demaunded if they came alone into Gaule.
                  
                  Madame, anſwered Amadis, King Cildadan came with vs in the Ship, and Bruneo alſo in company who (by great misfortune) chaunced to bee wounded ſome few dayes ſince. He is a good knight, valiant and hardy, and my deſire is, he may find entertainement fitting his deſert. Truſt me Sonne (quoth ſhe) he ſhal haue heere all the honor and reſpect may beſt be deuiſed, as well for his owne ſake, as for your faire affection towards him. And I will command your Siſter (who knowes right well how to cure all kinde of wounds) that ſhee ſhall bee carefull of his health. Siſter, ſaide Galaor, I ioyne

with my Mother in this ſuit to you, for he is worthy of all helpe, and I know no Gentleman liuing, more forward then hee in the ſeruice of faire Ladies. Witneſſe the Arke of loyall Louers, where he made proof of his loue to one, that well may eſteeme her ſelfe moſt fortunate, to be honoured with the ſeruice of ſo loyall a man, as neuer could be taxed with any diſloyalty.
                  When Melicia heard theſe words of her brother Galaor, in behalfe of him, whom ſhe loued as dearely as her owne life; ſhe could not auoid bluſhing: neuertheleſſe, being diſcreetly wiſe, ſhe modeſtly excuſed this alteration, and ſaid to her Brother Galaor. Sir, ſince it ſtands ſo well with the lyking of you and my Mother; heere I promiſe yee, that I will vſe my very beſt endeauour in his ſeruice. At this pauſe entred the Kings Cildadan and Perion, who (as yet) had not heard of his Sonnes arriuall, that kneeled downe, and did him humble reuerence. Enfoulding them louingly in his armes, he demāded, what fortune had broght them thus together, conſidering the generall report, that Galaor was loſt on the day of battaile, which King Cildadan had againſt King Liſuart. You ſay very true Sir, replyed Amadis, and ſo began to diſcourſe, how he and Brunco arriued at the Sad Iſle. Alas (quoth King Cildadan, can we talke he

In ſadneſſe (anſwered the Queene) there is nothing more contrary to a greene wound, then coldnes of the water. And therefore inſtantly commaunded, that hee ſhould be conueyed into one of the beſt Chambers in the Caſtell, which accordingly was done forth with.
                  Then came the Ladies to viſite him, and the Queene gaue him moſt gracious welcome, deſiring him to be of good cheere: For heere is my Daughter (quoth ſhe) right skilfull in the Art of Chirurgerie, that meanes to bee your often viſitant. But Bruneo tooke theſe words otherwiſe then the Queene meant them, becauſe (as formerly hath beene related) he affected Melicia with his ſoules beſt integritie, and for her loue onely, and none other, had approoued and ended part of the aduentures of the Encloſed Iſland.

So ſhe withdrawing, left her Daughter, and ſome other of her Ladies, to prouide ſuch things as were needfull for him. By this aduantage of time and place, Melicia ſeated her ſelfe ſo apparantly in his eye; as he might perfectly apprehend the ra

                  Well vnderſtood Melicia, to what effect this anſwere tended: yet would 
                        •
                     hee not ſeeme to yeeld any apparant note thereof, but hauing

concluded his firſt dreſſing, ſayd my Lord Brunco, for my ſake (I pray yee) receiue a little ſuſtenance, and afterward take ſome reſt if you can. Then calling for ſuch foode as ſhee knew meereſt for him, and with a hand (more white then Alablaſter) making it ready for his eating: ſhe quickened ſuch delicate apprehenſions in his ſoule, that his eye went farre beyond his appetite. So, commanding euery one to depart the Chamber, that the leaſt noyſe might nor offend him, ſhe ſaid. You haue promiſed mee, that you will eſſay ſome repoſe, let me ſee how obedient you will be herein, till ſuch time as I come to viſite you againe: Then her ſelfe departing, ſhe called Laſinde, Bruncos Eſquire, and ſaid vnto him. Friend, you know (better then any other) your Maiſters conditions, make demaund therefore of ſuch things as you thinke fitteſt for him.
                  The Squire was not now to learne, what entercourſe of affection had paſſed betweene them, and therefore, preſuming more boldly in his owne wit, then one leſſe skilfull, hee returned her this anſwere. Madame, I wiſh no worſe to my worthy Maiſter, then that good fortune would conduct him to ſome ſuch place, where he might make acknowledgement of the fauours you affoord him. But it appeares to me, that ſuch as are deſirous to recouer a wounded body, firſt of all, they ſhould apply helpe to the place principally offended. Which kinde of Phyſick inſtructeth me, to entreate your pittie to my poore Maiſter, who endureth, not ſo much paine by the hurt ſo lately receiued; as by a diſeaſe of greater antiquity, and you that are the onely cauſe, can beſt miniſter the mittigation. Friend (quoth ſhee) I can tell how to helpe an infirmity wherewith I am acquainted, but ſecret ſoares are quite out of my curing. Truſt me Madame, replied the Squire, if the one ſeeme plaine to you, the other is no leſſe apparrant, for you are not ignorant, that the extremitie of his affection to you, was the maine motiue, why he went to behold the Images of Apolidon and Grimaneſe in the Encloſed Iſland. Laſinde (quoth ſhee) they that become ſicke by ſuch a ſtrange meanes, had neede haue much time to compaſſe their amendment; without vrging any other remedy, then that which experience ſhall repute moſt neceſſarie.
                  And ſo ſhe left the Squire, who went forthwith, and acquainted his Lord with all the conference, that had paſt betweene him and the Infanta Melicia: wherewith hee was not any way diſpleaſed, perſwading himſelfe, that ſhe had thus diſcreetly anſwered, repoſing (as yet) but ſlender confidence in the Squire. And like as true louers often vſe to doe, he conuerted all to his owne beſt aduantage; being much better contented then euer heretofore, and thanking God, that Andadones hurting him, had fauoured him with ſuch an extraordinary felicity. For, vnder the happie fortune of this wound, he oftentimes enioyed her gracious companie, without whom, life was moſt tedious to him.
                  Some few dayes after, Amadis, Galaor and King Cildadan walking together, Galaor perceiuing the nere approch of King Perion, hee went vnto him with theſe words. Sir, I moſt humbly entreate your Princely aduiſe, in a matter ſomething queſtionable with mine owne iudgement. You know (my Lord)

quoth hee to his Brother Amadis, that you gaue me to King Liſuart, commanding me to ſerue him, and that I ſhould be wholy his, whereof I made him faithfull promiſe, and you likewiſe. Now, beholding how great a differēce hath happened betweene you two, during the time of my abſence: I finde my ſelfe very ſtrangely perplexed, conſidering, what errour I may commit, by taking part with him againſt you, as alſo, how iuſtly I may be blamed by him, forſaking him in a time of ſuch vrgent neceſſity. Wherefore moſt Royall father, I humbly craue your opinion in this caſe, to preuent my diſhonour on either ſide, and that reaſon may bee preferred before mine owne will.
                  Sonne, anſwered King Perion, you may not fayle to follow your Brother, againſt a King ſo head-ſtrong and vngratefull, for if you gaue your ſelfe to his ſeruice againſt all men: yet your brothers cauſe ca

                     ies an exception herein, in which reſpect, you may well forgoe your attendance on him, not onely becauſe hee declares himſelfe to Amadis (in his owne perſon) a deadly enemy, but alſo to all his kinred and friends, amongſt whom you ought to hold the prime place. Sir, replied Galaor, it appeares to me (vnder correction) that I ſhall greatly forget my ſelfe, and runne into no meane blamefull imputation, by withdrawing my ſeruice from him, before his owne permiſſion to that purpoſe: for, ſeeing (in the times of peace) hee gaue mee honour and good entertainment; what will be noyſed abroade of mee, to forſake him when affaires of importance be fall him?
                  Well knew Amadis, whereto the ſpeeches of Galaor aimed, and that hee had no will to keepe him company: wherefore, formalizing him-ſelfe anſwerable to his Brothers fantaſie, hee thus anſwered him. Brother, although we both ſtand highly obliged, to obey the councell and commaund of the King our father: yet I will humbly deſire his pardon, in telling my minde concerning your intention. Seeing you are ſo earneſtly addicted to returne into Great Brittan, and to continue in the ſeruice of King Liſuart; it likes mee well that you ſhould doe ſo. For, in the caſe that concerneth our difference, I doubt not, but 
                        ••
                     w many good Knights ſoeuer ſhall come to attend him; God, who is a iuſt Iudge, will (in the end) make him know, what wrong he hath done vs, and his ouer-great ingratitude, eſpecially to mee, that haue honoured him with ſo many well deſeruing ſeruices. Therefore, may it ſo pleaſe our Kingly father; hee may licence your departure, for I am contented with it. Why then (quoth the King) God be your guide, and I will reſt in this hope, that you may (one day) be the meanes, of compounding peace in ſo vnhappy a warre.
                  Thus Galaor obtayned his deſire for departure, and becauſe King Cildadan would ſhape ſome honeſt excuſe to goe along with him; hee began in this manner. My Lords, it is ſufficiently knowen to you all, to what iſſue the battaile came, which I had againſt King Liſuart, who only (by your meanes) got the glorie of the day, to my no little diſaduantange: for ſuch honor as (in Iuſtice) appertained to mee, conuerted to my great confuſion, in regard, that by the couenants on either ſide concluded before, I was conſtrained (for a limitted time) to acknowledge him as my Commander, and to ſerue him 
                        〈…〉
                      with all my

knights, which was no meane griefe in me to accompliſh. But valuing mine honor much dearer then life, I yeelded to controule and checke mine owne will, and (according to my promiſe) to bring him a number of my ſubiects in his aſſiſtance, whereof already he hath giuen mee ſummons, and no later then this very morning; for at the ending of Maſſe, I receiued Letters from him to that effect. Wherefore my good Lords, in doing no more then mine honor bindeth me to, let me goe along to him with my friendly compa

                  At the ending of theſe ſpeeches, they withdrew to their Chambers, where they continued till ſuch time as they went to reſt, and in the morning came to take their leaue of King Perion and Amadis, embarking themſelues in a good Ship, that wayted there for them, and the windes ſitting proſperouſly for their departing. So weighing Anker, they ſayled into Great Brittaine towards King Liſuart; who (the very ſame day) had tydings of the Count Latins ouerthrow and his men. Whereat he conceiued ſuch diſpleaſure, that without attending his leuied Army, he purpoſed to part thence, with ſo few knights as were then in his Court. Neuertheleſſe, he concluded firſt to hunt the Hart, with all the Ladies in his company; wherefore mounting earely the next morning on horſebacke; he met the whole aſſembly to the Forreſt, where his Tents were readily prepared for him. Great delight had they in hunting, but hee himſelfe could not forget the iniurie, receiued by the knights of the Encloſed Iſland at the Burning Lake, minding nothing more, then how he might be reuenged on them, according as heereafter you ſhall heare declared.
               
               
                  CHAP. III.
                  
                     How King Cildadan and Galaor, in trauayling towards the Court of King Liſuart, met with twelue Knights, and a Lady, who conducted a young Gentleman, that entreated the King to make him Knight.
                  
                  
                     
                        DOn Galaor and King Cildadan arriuing in Great Brittaine, immediately heard newes, that King Liſuart prepared his Army for paſſage to the Iſle of Mongaza, and that his departure would be ſpeedily in regard whereof, they made all the haſte they might to bee with him before he diſlodged thence, and comming neere to the place of his abiding, they reſted in the midſt of a great Forreſt. On the next morning as they were ready to mount on horſe-backe, they heard (not farre off) the Bell of ſome hermitage, and making thitherward to heare Maſſe
                        •
                     at their entrance into the Chappell, they beheld twelue greene Shields, each hauing a golden Tower painted in the midſt, all ſet in order about the Altar, and by them ſtood another Shield, wholly white, garniſhed with fine Gold, and enriched with many precious ſtones, whereat they

were ſomwhat amazed, becauſe they ſaw no knights to whom they appertained. Notwithſtanding, as they kneeled at their prayers, a Squire entred, of whom Galaor demanded, who had placed thoſe ſhields there? Sir (quoth the Squire) your requeſt may not now bee anſwered: but if you goe to the Court of King Liſuart, there you will quickly know ſome 
                        •…
                     uelties.
                  Now as they were iſſuing foorth, there entred twelue knights; each of them guiding a Damoſell by the hand, the faireſt and beſt formed that poſſibly could be ſeene, all of them holding conference with a Gentle-woman more auncient in yeares, that ſeemed as a conductres to the reſt. Well perceiued Galaor and King Cildadan (by her habit) that ſhe was a ſtranger, and maruailed the more what ſhe ſhould be: but they deferred any further enquiry for that time, becauſe they beheld the Hermite readily habited to ſay Maſſe. Which was no ſooner ended, but the elder Damoſell addreſſed her ſelfe towards King Cildadan and Galaor, demaunding of them, whether they were of King Liſuarts Court, or no. Why aske ye? anſwered the King. Becauſe (quoth the Damoſell) we earneſtly deſire your conduct thither, ſo pleaſe it you to affoord vs ſuch fauour. For wee are aduertiſed that he is in this Forreſt, accompanied with his Queene, and a goodly troupe of Ladies, where he runneth the Hart. Beleeue mee Damoſell, replyed Galaor, ſo pleaſe it you, we will keepe you company. Sir, quoth ſhe, a thouſand thankes, and ſeeing wee finde you ſo gently diſpoſed, and are (as wee imagine) ſome of his followers: our ſuite to you is, that you would entreat him, to beſtow knighthood on this yong Squire heere preſent with vs, aſſuring yee, that he is deriued of ſo high birth, as he well deſerueth to haue that honour, and much greater, if poſſible it might be.
                  Truely Damoſell, anſwered Galaor, I ſhall very gladly doe it, and am perſwaded, that a King ſo good and gracious, will not deny me a requeſt ſo reaſonable. Let vs preſently then, replyed the Damoſell, ſet forward to him, while our Gentleman (according to commendable cuſtome) ſhall performe his deuotions heere in this Chappell. So mounting on horſebacke, ſhe rode on alone in the company of Galaor and King Cildadan, and as they deſcended downe an hill, they eſpied the King croſſing the Valley, who perceiuing two knights armed in that manner, imagined that they made their abode there, to Iouſte with any other that ſhould firſt paſſe by. And albeit he had thirty knights in his company as his guard, and each man ready for any ſuch encounter: yet (at that time) he was not willing to haue any ſuch tryall of the Launce; but ſent Grumedan towards Galaor and his company, to requeſt their inſtant repaire to the King, which accordingly hee did: and ſo ſoone as Galaor perceiued his neerer approch, he preſently knew him, and ſhewing him to King Cildadan, ſaid. This is old Grumedan (quoth he) who bare King Liſuartes Enſigne in the battell againſt you. By my faith (anſwered King Cildadan) he is a very worthy man; for on that day, I contended more againſt him, then any other in the whole band. And I well remember, that wee grew (at laſt) to hand-gripes, when I ſtroue to wreſt his weapon from him: but it was a matter beyond my power, and yet I brake it in the handle, as himſelfe faſt held it.
                  Their helmets were off, in regard

of the heates extremitie, by which meanes Grumedan quickly knew Galaor; and giuing his horſe the ſpurre, he rode to embrace him, ſaying. My Noble Lord, you are welcome, behold the King, who hath ſent me to yee, imagining you to bee otherwiſe then you are indeed, and therefore deſireth you to come ſpeake with him. Lord Grumedan, anſwered Galaor, king Cildadan is here with me, and wee both will goe to ſalute his Maieſty. In good faith (quoth Grumedan) hee will be very ioyfull for your returne, and if you pleaſe, I will ride before to acquaint him therewith. Doe ſo, replied Galaor, and wee will follow yee. Grumedan returning, and the king hauing obſerued his long conference with the two knights, demanded (at his arriuall) who they were. Sir, anſwered Grumedan, the one is my Lord Galaor, who hath brought yee king Cildadan in his company. How? quoth the king, is it poſſible? Yes verily, replied Grumedan. It is, ſaid the king, the higheſt good happe that could now befall me, let vs therfore goe and kindely welcome them. As he made towards them, hee beheld Galaor and king Cildadan, diſmounted from their horſes to doe him reuerence, whereupon, he embraced them with ſo cheerefull a countenance, that it might eaſily be noted by the whole company, how pleaſing their arriuall was to him.
                  His next demaund, was concerthe auncient Damoſell that came thither with them. Sir, anſwered Galaor, we found her (a while ſince) in an Hermitage neere adioyning, accompanied with twelue K
                        •…
                     s and a young Gentleman, the goodlieſt perſon that hath beene ſeene, who (as is giuen me to vnderſtand) hath trauailed from a far off Countrie, expreſſely to receiue his Knight-hood, ſo it ſtood with your liking to beſtow it on him, for hee will not haue it of any other as he ſaith himſelfe. Wherefore King Cildadan and I doe entreate yee, moſt humbly, that you would grant it him: in regard, that his lookes and behauiour doe ſpeake no leſſe, but that he is well and worthily deſcended. The King neuer vſed to affoord ſuch an honour, but where he knew it to bee eſpecially deſerued, wherefore, hearing this requeſt made by Galaor (leaning vpon King Cildadans ſhoulder) he ſtood penſiuely a long while, without any anſwere: becauſe, that by denying them, he imagined they would take it offenſiuely, and in yeelding to their motion, it appeared vncouth vnto him, and irregulare to his wonted cuſtome. Neuertheleſſe, hee demaunded of the Damoſell, whoſe ſonne hee was? Sir, quoth ſhe, you may not know that as yet: but I dare ſweare vpon my ſoule, that he is extracted of Royall ſeede by both ſides.
                  What thinke you then my deare friend, quoth the King to Galaor, may wee make him Knight? You may very well doe it Sir (anſwered he) without ſtanding longer on any excuſe, for I preſume he wil prooue of no meane merit. On Gods name then be it ſo, replied the King: yet I would haue the Queene and her Ladies witneſſes thereof, and therefore goe you before to them, and cauſe them to meete vs at the place where hee remaineth, for bee well aſſured, they all will be right ioyfull to ſee yee. So the King tooke 
                        •
                     he way towards the Hermitage, and Galaor, with King Cildadan, went to finde the Queene
                        •
                      where you may well perſwade your

ſelues, that neuer did men meete with more gracious welcome, eſpecially by the Princeſſes Oriana and Mabila, for their hope was (by them) to heare ſome newes of Amadis, and that they would worke his meanes, for recouering the Kings fauour againe. Hauing finiſhed their beſt ſalutations on all ſides, Galaor told them, that the King had ſent for them, and vpon what occaſion, to their no little ioy and contentment: for euery one was deſirous to ſee the yong gallant, of whom Galaor had giuen ſuch high commendations.
                  The Queene and her Ladies being all mounted, made ſuch ſpeed to the Hermitage, that they alighted there, euen as the King was entring into the Chappell, where beholding the twelue Shields, placed about that which was altogether white, and the young Gentleman very deuoutly at his prayers: he appeared ſo pleaſing in their eyes, that the former report came far ſhort of their preſent opinion of him, for, in their beſt of iudgement, they had neuer beheld a more comely creature, nor of a more ſetled and aſſured countenance. He ſeeing ſuch a goodly company of Ladies and Knights, aroſe, and gaue them moſt humble reuerence. Then the King tooke him by the hand, and demanded if he would bee a Knight. Sir, quoth he, for nothing elſe haue I iourneyed from ſo farre a Country, but to craue it at your hand, ſo pleaſed it you ſo much to honour mee. Truſt me ſaid the King, you ſhall not be denied, and he falling on his knees, the King gaue him the Accolade, according to the ceremonie then vſed in Knight-hood, ſaying vnto him; Be a Knight in the name of God, and ſo tooke him vp. Now, quoth he, for receiuing your Sword; you may make choiſe of any in this company, that ſtands fayreſt in your owne liking. Sir, replied our new made knight, I deſire then, that Madame Oriana may doe it, for if ſhe performe it, I haue the thing that my ſoule moſt longeth after. Is it euen ſo? ſaid the King, I will ſolicite her on your behalfe, and ſtepping to the Princes, thus proceeded. You heare how deſirous the knight is, that you would beſtow ſuch an honour on him; let mee entreate yee, not to denie him.
                  Now, the faire young Princeſſe, to whom (neuer till then) any ſuch requeſt had beene made, neither knew what might be his reaſon that made the motion: had ſo little power ouer her preſent condition, that a moſt amiable bluſh mounted vp in to her cheekes. Yet taking the Sword preſented to her, ſhee guided it to the knight, after the vſuall maner. Then ſpake the ancient Damoſell to the King, ſo low as none but himſelfe could heare her. Sir (quoth ſhee) ſeeing you haue done ſuch honour to our knight, he ſhall remaine (if you be ſo pleaſed) in your ſeruice, with theſe twelue other knigh
                        •
                     s, that hitherto haue kept him company. And becauſe dutie commandeth ſo much in me, as to returne againe to her that ſent mee hither: I muſt entreate your fauour for my departure, firſt letting you know, that he is named Norandell, and is more yours then you imagine, as you ſhal further vnderſtand by this Letter; which hauing verie cloſely conueied into his hand, ſhe tooke her leaue, and rode on her iourney, leauing him penſiuely perplexed at her words And becauſe he doubted, that the Letter might containe ſome more important matter: hee

feigned, as if hee would returne to his huntſmen, the better to reade the Letter where himſelfe pleaſed: deſiring Galaor and king Cildadan, to reconduct the Ladies backe to their Tents, awayting there the houre of dinner, while he (in meane time) would kill a Hart. But if I faile (quoth he) in comming to dinner, expect me not till ſupper time. So ſetting onward to the chaſe, and finding himſelfe accompanied but with few: hee opened the Letter, which contained as hereafter followeth.
                  
                     
                        The Letter from the Infanta Celinda, to King Liſuart.
                        
                        
                           MOſt mighty and excellent Prince, by reading this Letter, it may be, you will remember, that when you trauerſed ſtrange Countries, and a Knight errant, giuing end to many great aduentures: Fortune directed your courſe into the kingdome of my Father, who was lately before deceaſſed, and you found me retired to one of my Caſtels, called the Great Roſier; where Anti

                                 〈◊〉
                               of courage, preuailed againſt him. By meanes whereof, I was 
                                 〈◊〉
                               after

                              reſtored to my rights, all which I muſt and doe confeſſe, to hold of you for euer, as being wholly yours, and my ſelfe alſo. And you pleaſed then to honour mee ſo much with your preſence, that you came into my Great Roſier, where wee conferring together in the delightfull Arbours: you gathered the floure of my virginity, as wee were ſporting in cropping ſweet Roſes, whereas the place was (and yet is) moſt plentifully abounding. Neither am I able to ſay, whether loue would haue it ſo, or my beauty prooued the maine occaſion: but wel I wot, your command was ſo potent ouer me, and I ſo feeble in reſiſtance; that before you departed hence, you left me conceiued of this young Gentleman, endued with ſuch faire forme and feature, as it appeared, that Nature was well pleaſed, to compleate him perfect in all excellence, thereby to deface all remembrance of our ſinne committed. Wherefore Sir, receiue him as your owne, being of Royall ſeede both by you and my ſelfe, which verily perſwadeth me, that he will prooue a valiant man, as retayning in him part of your famous proweſſe, and part of the exceeding loue wherein he was conceiued, at ſuch time as you gaue me this Ring, which I ſend ye heere encloſed likewiſe, in the teſtimony of the faithfull promiſe you then made to your humble ſeruant Celinda, Daughter to King Hegide, who kiſſeth the hand of your Royall Maieſtie.
                        
                     
                  
                  When King Liſuart had read and re-read ouer this Letter, word by word, he perfectly called to minde, all that the Princeſſe had there ſet downe, albeit it was long time before his ſoiourning in the kingdome of Denmarke, where (as a wandring Knight) he performed ſuch actions of Armes, as he wonne the loue of the Infanta Briſenna, whom after-ward he married, according as formerly hath beene declared. Notwithſtanding,

hee determined to make no account at all of Norandell (though he knew him to be his naturall Sonne) vntill hee perceiued how he would beare himſelfe, and deſerued by his deedes, to prooue ſuch a one as he deſired. As he continued in theſe priuate conſiderations, a goodly Hart, purſued by a ful cry of Hounds, paſſed hard by him, and the Huntſmen followed on ſo cloſely, that there the Deere loſt his life. In regard whereof the King was willing to giue ouer further ſporting, and commaunded the Huntſmen to beare the Hart to the Queenes Tent.
                  Afterward, being ſet at the Table. Galaor and King Cildadan keeping him company; all dinner while hee had but little conference with them, for thinking ſtill on Celinda, and her Letter ſent him. Dinner being ended, he tooke Galaor aſide, and as they walked, thus diſcourſed with him. My worthy friend, ſo much doe I relye vpon your fidelitie and loue, as I hold you to bee the onely man in the world, to whom I dare make knowne my very intimate ſecrets. And ſetting aſide thoſe matters of no meane importance, which (during the time of your abſence haue happened to me: I will onely acquaint yee with an eſpeciall accident this day befalne me. So, deliuering him the Letter which Celinda had ſent, hee willed him to peruſe what it contained. Galaor reading it ouer aduiſedly, perceiued therby, that Norandell was Sonne to the King, whereat conceiuing no little ioy, he returned this anſwere. Aſſuredly Sir, if you tooke ſuch paines for your faire friend, in mine opinion, ſhe is no way behinde ye in honorable recompence, hauing broght ye ſuch a goodly Son, as will proue a worthy man, and a valiant knight in Armes. Nor let the concealment heereof be irkeſome to ye, becauſe when you ſhall pleaſe to make it knowen, it will redound to your great ioy and honour. And if it agreed with your good liking, to let me enioy him as my companion, what ſeruices heereaſter I ſhall doe for you, I will account to bee moſt worthily imployed.
                  What? quoth the King, would you trouble your ſelfe with a Boy, affoording him (at the firſt) ſo great an honour, not knowing his temper, or how he will carry himſelfe? It is well knowne, that there is not any knight in Great Brittaine, but he will repute himſelf much happy, to haue ſuch grace as you offer him. Sir, (quoth Galaor) it is the firſt requeſt that euer I made to yee, and I humbly deſire, that I may not be denied. On my faith (quoth the King) if you honor him ſo much, you ſhal highly oblige him to you, and doe me alſo an eſpeciall fauour. And no mean glory to my ſelfe, replyed Galaor for he being Son to ſo famous a 
                        〈◊〉
                      cannot faile to bee one of the beſt knights in the world. Doe then (quoth the King) as ſhall 
                        〈◊〉
                      beſt. And as they held on this diſcourſe, the Queene came in, w
                        •…
                      made them breake off, and ſhee being accompanied with King Cildadan, Norandell, and many other knights, continued familiar conference together, till Galaor entred into theſ ſpeeches.
                  Sir, you know that by the cuſtome heere vſed in this kingdome of Great Brittaine, no new made knight ought to refuſe any knight Lady or Damoſell, the firſt demand they ſhall make vnto him. You ſay very true Sir, anſwered the King ther wherefore doe you moue t
                        •…
                     
                     ſtion? Becauſe Sir, replyed 
                        〈◊〉
                      am a knight, and I would 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     
                     Norandell, to graunt what I ſhall require of him, to wit, that (for one whole yeare) he and I may be fellowes, and companions, not any way to be ſundered or deuided, except death or impriſonment ſhall enforce it. When Norandell heard this, hee was no leſſe amazed then well pleaſed: for he very well knew, that Galaor was eſteemed one of the beſt knights in that Court, and that the king affoorded much more honour to him, then any other that, kept him company, and thereupon he thus replied. My Lord Galaor it may eaſily bee diſcerned by your demaund, in how many obligations of dutie you would haue mee bound vnto you, in wiſhing that grace to mee, which I much rather ought to haue begged of you. And this I dare aſſure yee, that not onely doe I graunt what you haue deſired, namely, my company: but alſo I giue my ſelfe wholly yours, and require, that in that nature you would receiue and accept me. Beleeue me, quoth king Cildadan, you haue both reaſon in theſe ſeuerall requeſts: you Lord Galaor, in vrging ſuch a fauour, and you likewiſe yong Norandell, in granting it: for if heauen bee pleaſed therewith, as we need not vſe any doubt, it will redound to the honour and benefit of either.
                  At this very inſtant, the King receiued intelligence, that his Army was to depart very ſpeedily, wherefore the next morning hee rode to the City, and riding alone by him-ſelfe he called Galaor to him, telling him. He was well contented, that his daughter Oriana ſhould know Norandell to be his ſonne, and her Brother, 
                        〈◊〉
                      ſhee ſhould the better loue and reſpect him; but yet hee w
                        •…
                      haue it reuealed to her very ſecretly. Sir, anſwered Galaor, I am perſwaded, that it will not a little pleaſe her, and therefore (if poſſibly I may) I will acquaint her therewith before wee come to Court. Doe ſo, quoth the king; Galaor riding backward, came to the Princeſſe, and to him (after ſome other conference had together) ſhe ſpake in this manner. Sir Galaor, I am perſwaded, that the Gentleman who was yeſterday made knight, hath beene a long while knowne to you, in regarde you made choiſe of him as your aſſociate and companion: for I know not any knight in this Court, but would thinke himſelfe highly honored, to be ſo graced by you, yea, though it were your brother Amadis.
                  
                  Madame, replied Galaor, your compariſon of mee with my Brother, is ſo vnequall, as the like ſpeeches may be ſpoken of heauen and earth: conſidering, that (in reſpect of me) he may bee tearmed heauen, and I (compared to him) farre inferiour to the lower element. And therefore, I repute it great preſumption in any knight whatſoeuer, to thinke himſelfe his ſecond: for it plainly appeareth, that fortune fauoured his election, to hold the primarie place in valour, feature, and all other gracious gifts required in a Gentleman. Full gladly did Oriana liſten to theſe praiſes of her Amadis, while inwardly ſhee thus ſpake to her ſelfe. Alas poore Lady, thy misfortune were vnmatchable, if in being thus ſeuered from the preſence of thy friend, thou ſhouldſt bee as farre diſtant from his intire affection: in good ſadneſſe, death would be a thouſand times more welcome to mee, then ſuch a deepe diſcomfort. But Galaor purpoſing a longer continuance of his diſcourſe, thus proceeded.

Let it be no matter of maruaile in you, faire Princeſſe, that I accepted Norandell into my company; for you may bee well aſſured, that I did it not but vpon great and good occaſion, and perhaps, it will no more diſlike you, then it doth me, when the cauſe is more familiar to yee? I pray yee Sir, quoth ſhe, if it bee a matter that your honour may diſpence withall, not to conceale it from me.
                  Madame, ſaid Galaor, the ſecret were very important, that I would not impart to you, and vpon faithfull promiſe of your priuacie, I will diſcouer it. Reſt boldly aſſured thereof, replied the Princeſſe. Vnderſtand then Madame, quoth Galaor, that Norandell is ſonne to the King your father and your Brother. And ſo declared, how hee had read the Letter from the Infanta Celinda, and the king likewiſe which ſhe had ſent to the king, with all the other ſpeeches paſſed betweene them. In good faith, anſwered the Princeſſe, I am highly pleaſed, to know this new affinity betweene Norandell and me: and now I giue you thankes withall my heart, for the worthy honour you haue done him, in accepting him to be your companion. For, in being with you, hee cannot faile of proouing to bee a good man, and a famous knight: whereas, ſhould hee be otherwiſe addicted, yet ſuch a bad nature would be quite altered, only by keeping your company, as hee hath faithfully promiſed. Madame, quoth Galaor, you haue power to ſay of me whatſoeuer you pleaſe, as of him, that is a moſt humble ſeruant both to the king and your ſelf, when and how it ſhall like you to imploy me.
                  So breaking off this enterparlance, they rode to the Queenes lodging, where Galaor diſmounting the Princeſſe, and hauing conducted her to her Chamber: hee departed thence with his new companion, vntill the next morning their going to the king, who told them, that hee purpoſed that night to ſleepe aboord his Ships, and the day following to ſet ſaile away, giuing order for euery mans being in readineſſe. The Drummes and Trumpets ſummoning all ſouldiours to their collours, they weighed Ankors on the morrow, and had the winde ſo auſpicious for them, as quickly they loue the ſight of Great Brittan: but ſoone after aroſe a ſhrewde Tempeſt, which made them very doubtfull of periſhing. Notwithſtanding, it calmed ſo fauorably in the end, that (on the fift day following) they diſcouered the Iſle of Mongaza: where they landed, neere to the place where king Arban lay encamped and fort fled, awayting for their ſuccour and ſupply.

                      foorth vpon them, and purſued them ſo violently: as if king Arban men had not wonne the toppe of the mountaine, they could not haue auoided diſcomfiture.
                  There did Floreſtan make good acknowledgement of his man-hood, for, meeting with Gaſquilan, king of Swetia, hee wounded him ſo daungerouſly, as euery one reputed him for dead. Neuertheleſſe, Briande Moniaſte (aduenturing ouer forwardly into the throng, with full intent to charge King Arban) was taken priſoner, being no way able to helpe himſelfe, ſo that on other ſide, many good knights were wounded, and layde along on the ground. All which king Liſuart heard at his arriuall, whereat hee

was ſo diſpleaſed, as no man could be more, concluding to bee reuenged on them. Which the better to performe, hee gaue commandement thorow his Campe, that no one ſhould preſume into the field, without licence thereto firſt obtayned, hoping that the enemie would come againe to aſſaile King Arban, as formerly he was wont to doe before his comming thither. But the other ſide had intelligence of this freſh ſuccour, in regard whereof they had retired themſelues, attending further fortune.
                  By this time, the houre drewe neere, when the Princeſſe Oriana ſhould bee deliuered of her childe, and her Fathers departure fitted it very well: for, within a day or two after his ſhipping thence, the paines and throwes of child-birth grew ſo extreamely on her, that (about mid-night) ſhee expected death euery minute. Therefore ſhe cauſed Mabila to riſe, as alſo the Damoſell of Denmarke, who had (long before) prouided all things in readineſſe, to bee required in ſuch a neceſſitie. They being come to her, found her ſo ouercome with paine and anguiſh (not daring to crye or vſe any complaint) that ſhee was vnable to hold out any longer. But Heauen pittying her oppreſſions, before the breake of day, requited her ſorrowes with the birth of a goodly Boy, which the Damoſel of Denmarke receiued, while Mabila gaue further attendance on the Mother. As ſhee was making it ready in the ſwadling clothes, ſhe diſcerned ſeauen Caracters vnder either little teate, ſome as red as blood, and the other as white as ſnow: whereat being not a little abaſhed, ſhee called Mabila, and ſhewed them to her. But neither of them had the skill to reade them; for they were all Greeke Letters, compoſed in Latin words, in which report, they forbare (as then) to acquaint the Mother therewith, wrapping it vp in the clothes, and laying it by the Mother, till ſhee gaue order for conueighing it thence, according as formerly hath beene determined, which being done, the Damoſell of Denmarke departed to call her brother Durin.
                  
                  In the meane while the Princeſſe holding the Infant in her armes, and beſtowing many ſweete kiſſes vpon it, ſpake in this manner. Alas little Creature, Heauen enlarge ſuch bleſſings on thee, that thou mayſt proue to be as good and vertuous a knight as thy Father, and make the beginning of thy fortunes more proſperous then his hath beene. Alas, I am enforced to forgoe thee, and ſhewe my ſelfe towards thee more cruell, then any Tiger or Leopard to their young ones. For I know not whether thou goeſt, nor when I ſhall ſee thee againe, which filleth my ſoule with ſuch affliction, as Fortune cannot affoord thee the very leaſt danger, but I ſhall finde it preſented before mine owne eyes. Oh that I could but know the Nurſe that ſhall giue thee ſucke; I would entreate her to bee very carefull of thee. For it may ſo come to paſſe, that ſhe will be ſo negligent of thee, that before thou canſt be able to helpe thy ſelfe: ſhe may many times leaue thee in the danger of wilde beaſts, while ſhe attendeth on ſlighter affairs, or elſe ſit goſſipping with her neighbours, telling vaine tales and fruitleſſe fables. Neither can I therein much condemne her, becauſe both ſhe (and many more beſide) may iudge thee to be the ſonne of ſome ſilly woman; and perhaps the beſt fauour they will beſtow on thee, ſhall be to make thee a Shepheard,

or ſome other flock-keeper on the field, who cannot alwayes be prouident in their paines, but (euen in deſpight of their vtmoſt diligence) the Wolfe or Lyon paſſing by, may make ſpoyle and bloody ruine.
                  Theſe words were accompanied with inundations of teares, and yet ſhe purpoſed their longer continuance, till the Damoſell of Denmarke entring the Chamber, ſaid. Madam, it will ſoone be day, therefore expedition is more fitting for vs, then vnthrifty delay Alas (quoth the Princeſſe) what intend yee to doe? What? ſaid the Damoſell, marie to ſaue your honour, and the life of your childe: doe not you remember, what we haue (long ſince) concluded together? And let me tell ye, my Brother Durin waiteth beneath vnder the window, to receiue the Infant as we ſhall let it downe. I feare, (quoth the Princeſſe) that you will kill it in the deſcent. Let our care be your warrant, anſwered the Damoſell. So taking it out of the Mothers Armes, ſhee was ready to ſwoune with griefe; and but that Mabila ſpake ſomewhat angerly to her, ſhe would haue riſen to follow it; but ſhe ſaid vnto her. Madame, if you grow ſo forgetfull of your ſelfe, we will forſake ye to: therefore ſuffer what muſt of neceſſity bee done, and (by the grace of God) all will goe well. So putting the child into a wicker Basket, and faſtening a ſtrong corde thereto, they let it downe at the window, to the place where Durin attended to receiue it. Afterward the Damoſel deſcended, and finding the horſes there, which Durin had brought thither: they mounted on them, taking their iourney through the Forreſt, becauſe they would not meete with any body.
                  So long they rode, till about day breake they arriued to a goodly Fountaine or Spring, which iſſued forth of an high Rocke, and vnder it was a Valley ſo obſcure, as well in regard of the depth thereof, as alſo the plentie of huge great Buſhes and Trees, that it was almoſt impoſſible to diſcerne bright day, as men paſſed along thorow it, and continually it was haunted with Wolues, Lyons and ſuch like cruell beaſts. From time of all antiquity, in a remote corner of this Valey, ſtood a ſmall Hermitage, wherein liued a holy man, named Naſcian, of whom it was euery where reported, that his life was ſo acceptable in Gods ſight, as he was oftentimes fed with heauenly food, when earthly ſuſtenance grew ſcant and fayled. All the company he had, was a young Lad his Nephew, who went abroad to get their daylie ſuſtentation, and himſelfe (in perſon) would diuerſe times driue his Aſſe before him, and yet no ſauage beaſts offer once to touch him, albeit they met him vſualy on the way; but rather would humble themſelues to the good old man, making him what mirthfull ſport their rude natures affoorded.
                  This place was ſo ſolitary and vnfrequented, that a Lyonneſſe did there yearely bring foorth her yong ones, and they would vſualy and priuily viſite Naſcian, euen as if they had beene his houſhold little dogges, and as duely would hee walke to ſee them in their denne. Whereinto, ſo ſoone as the Lyonneſſe ſaw him enter, ſhee would wander abroade to ſeeke her prey, as ſeeming to leaue her whelpes in his ſafe protection: becauſe continually hee haunted thither twiſe or thrice each day, ſuch was his delight in ſeeing them play with one

another. Now, by ſuch time as the Damoſell drew neere to the fountaine, the prime of the mornings clearneſſe beganne to appeare, and ſhe found her ſelfe ſo ſpent with trauaile, which all the night time ſhe had endured, that ſhee ſaid to Durin. I pray yee Brother, let vs refreſh our ſelues a while in this place.
                  Hereupon, they alighted from their horſes, hee taking the Infant from his Siſter, to lay it at the roote of a tree neere the fountaine, while he receiued her downe in his armes. The Lyonneſſe then walking in the depth of the valley began to ſend foorth ſuch dreadfull roarings, that the horſe whereon the Damoſell roade (being fearefull at his noiſe) ranne ſwiftly away with her, before Durin had ſcarcely layde downe the child, and doe whatſoeuer ſhee could to the contrarie, carried her ouer-thwart the Forreſt, ſhee not hauing any power to deſcend. Durins horſe alſo ranne away in the like manner, whereat he ſtood as confounded with amazement; for hee ſaw his Siſter in danger, heard her crie and call to him for helpe, and yet hee could not lend her any, becauſe hee was on foote, laying downe the childe that ſlept full ſweetly. At length, perceiuing no preſent ſigne of perill to the Infant, hee concluded to follow the Damoſell, and therefore ran that way which the horſe had taken: finding him in a thicket of young trees, and ſhe falne downe, almoſt depriued of her ſences.
                  Hauing holpen her vp, he prayed her to ſit there a while, vntill he had recouered their horſes, and caſting his eye aſide, eſpied hers ſo farre entred into a quickſet, that he eaſily tooke him, and brought him to her. As he intended to purſue his owne, ſhee ſaid vnto him; Good Brother, goe firſt to the childe, and bring it hither to mee, for if the bloudy beaſt finde it, farewell all hope of life. I will goe fetch it, quoth Durin, therefore ſtay you my returne in this place; And as hee offred to mount vp on her horſe, ſhe perſwaded him to the contrary, leaſt meeting with the Lyonneſſe, or hearing her cry againe, worſe might befall him. Durin followed her aduiſe, and departing thence without any longer delay, went directly towards the fountaine. But ſome ſmall while before hee could get thither, the Lyonneſſe had paſſed by, and taken vp the Infant with his teeth, not doing it any harme at all. By this time the morning was ſo farre growen on, that Naſcian (hauing ſung his Maſſe) walked abroade (according to his wonted cuſtome) before the denne of the young Lyons, and beholding the Lyonneſſe to bring them ſuch an vnuſuall kinde of prey: ſtepped iuſt in her way of paſſage, not a little wondring where and how ſhee had found it. Approching neerer to her, in threatning manner, hee thus ſpake to her. Cruell beaſt, who made thee ſo bold, to offer iniurie to a creature, ſent by God into the world, to doe him ſeruice and honour? It is no food for thee, or thy whelpes.
                  The Lyonneſſe ſeemed to bee fearefull, and (euen as if ſhe had vnderſtood the commaund of Naſcian) couched downe preſently on the ground, and moouing her eares and taile in louing manner, layde downe the infant, and beganne to lick it. Then the good olde man tooke it vp in his armes, and in bleſſing it, ſaid, Alas little Babe, thy mother that hath thus vnmercifully left thee, is well worthy to be curſſed

of God. The childe beganne to cry, and make much moane, which mooued the aged man to ſuch compaſſion, that the teares ſtreamed aboundantly downe his reuerend beard. And not knowing how to quiet it with any preſent ſuſtenance, concluded in the end, to driue the Lyonneſſe into her denne, and there to ſuckle it among her whelpes; which as hee did, hee ſaid. I commande thee by the power of God, to whom all things liuing doe owe obedience; that thou giue nouriſhment to his creature, and to bee as carefull of it as to any of thine owne. The Lyonneſſe made no refuſall, but ſuffred the child to ſuck ſo long as it liſted: and then the Hermit taking it from her, carried it a long with him louingly to his Hermitage.
                  Preſently hee ſent for his Siſter to come to him, to aduiſe what ſhould be done with the child, and his young Nephew was dilligent in the buſineſſe: but fortune was ſo contrarie, that hee found not his mother at home, becauſe the day before, ſhee and her husband was gon to a village ſomewhat farre off, ſo as they could not be returned in the ſpace of eight whole dayes. During which time, Naſcian found himſelfe much encombred, for hee was but badly acquainted with the office of a Nurſſe, and therefore, finding no other remedie: till they were returned, he made his beſt meanes by the Lyonneſſe, as alſo a faire Ewe, that had newly eaned, and theſe holpe to foſter our poore forſaken infant.
                  But returning now to Durin, thinking to finde the child at the fountaine, where he had left it: he was greatly aſtoniſhed, when he perceiued his purpoſe defeated. Neuertheleſſe, he ſo earneſtly endeuoured, to know what was become of it; that at laſt, he found the tracke of the Lyonneſſe which had carried it thence, and preſuming that ſhe had deuoured it, in mournfull teares he returned to his Siſter. She vnderſtanding this hapleſſe fortune, fell downe as one entranced, and breathing forth many pittifull lamentations.

O deare God, wouldſt thou permit ſo yong a creature to periſh, that neuer in it ſelfe offended thee? It is I that am iuſtly worthy of the ſeueareſt puniſhment, and I would that this miſhap had falne vpon my ſelfe, for life is now but loathſome to mee. Sweet Babe, thy Father (euen as yong as thou) beganne to proue the dangers of this world: and yet our Lord (in his great goodneſſe) pleaſed to preſerue him. But thy miſ-fortune is much more ſtrange then his, becauſe when he was left to the mercie of the waues, Gandales (in a happy houre) met with him, and afterward did foſter him, as euery one well knoweth. But alas, little darling, thou didſt fall into the mercy of a brute beaſt, that had no more pitty then his owne nature gouerned, and ſo didſt thou finiſh thy dayes, before they were (wel neere) begunne.
                  Theſe lamentations were ſleeped in many floods of teares, Durin being no way able to comfort her, becauſe (for a long while) death more appeared in her, then life. Notwithſtāding, he knew ſo wel how to manage arguments of reaſon, that hauing

ſomewhat preuailed ouer her paſſion, he thus ſpake to her. Siſter, it may ſo fall out, that heauen hath beene gracious to him in pitty, for many other haue beene borne away by wilde beaſts, and yet afterward attained to great perfection. Therefore, the beſt way is, to comfort your ſelfe for you may doe yet many ſeruices to the Princeſſe, and to Lord Amadis, who, in looſing you, ſhall ſuſtaine a double loſſe. What would you aduiſe me (quoth ſhee) to do? marie this, anſwered Durin, that we mounting both vpon your horſes,

And when your Lady enquireth concerning her childe, you may tell her (liſtening ſomwhat to the counſell of Mabila) that he is in the gouernment of a very good Nurſe. This aduice being allowed for good, they departed thence, taking the direct roade way to Mirefleure, where they remained for a time, before they would returne

                  About tenne dayes after hee had ſent for his Siſter, ſhee came vnto him, accompanied onely with her huſband. Then he declared to her, how and in what manner he did find the childe, in the deuouring mouth of the Lyoneſſe, carying it as food for her young ones: but by Gods permiſſion hee recouered it from her, and away

Then the Hermite brought her where the Infant lay ſleeping vpon a bedde of leaues and moſſe, and ſhee no ſooner ſaw him, but his very appearance pleaſed her beyond meaſure, and ſhe asked of him, what was his name. In troth, quoth he, that is (as yet) vnknowne to me, but to cleare vs of all doubt, I will preſently bapti

He beſtowed ſuch paines to vnderſtand them, that hee found this word Eſplandian in Latine letters, but his skill reached not ſo far as the Greeke. Hereupon perſwading himſelfe, that he brought his name from his mothers wombe, hee would not rob him of it, but confirmed it by Baptiſme, naming him Eſplandian, and ſo was he afterward knowne in many ſtrange Countries, where he broght to end many great aduentures, as we ſhall reade heere-after.
                  But for the preſent, wee ſpare to ſpeake of them, let it therefore ſuffiſe ye, that the child being chriſtened, and committed to the care of his Nurſe and her husband: they returned home to their houſe, where they tended him with ſuch louing reſpect, that time brought him to ſuch comely ſhape and growth, that euery eye delighted to look on him. Thus as their owne Sonne they nurſed and prouided for him, vntill ſuch time as they returned him againe to the Hermite, according to his former appointment.

                     How King Liſuart fought a Battell againſt the Knights of the Encloſed Iſland, whom he vanquiſhed. And of the great liberalitie he vſed afterward to Galuanes, in reſtoring him to all the lands and Seigneuries belonging to Madaſima.
                     
                  
                  
                     HEeretofore you haue heard, how King Liſuart and his Army landed in the Iſle of Mongaza, where they found King Arban fortified in the mountaines, doubtfull of Galuanes and his forces, who twiſe or thriſe had giuen him ſhrewd repulſes. Now you are to vnderſtand, that after they were thus met together, the King gaue command to raiſe his Campe, and paſſe thence to the plaine Champian ground: for hee had aduertiſement, that the knights of the Encloſed Iſland were departed from the Burning Lake, as purpoſing to bid him battaile. So marched on theſe two Armies each againſt other, and had giuen charge the very ſame day, but that night preuented them; and therefore they were conſtrained to deferre it till the next morning. Then arming themſelues, King Liſuart ordayned his forces into three bat tallions; the firſt led by Galaor and fiue hundred knights, among whom were Norandell, Guillan the Penſiue, Ladaſin and Cendtle. The ſecond was guided by King Cildadan, with ſeuen hundred other knights, hauing in their company Ganides, Brandoynas and Philippinell. The third, King Arban of Northwales had charge of, with Don Grumedan, and many other knights beſide, both bold and valiant, appointed as guard for the perſon of King Liſuart: who before he meant to enterfight, beholding his enemies approach ſo neere him, gaue theſe ſpeeches to al his followers.
                  My worthie friends, you haue heere preſent before your eyes, the reaſon that mooued vs to croſſe the Seas, to defend the honor of Great Brittaine, and this Country which is ours; as is moſt notoriouſly manifeſt, by our agreements made with Ardan Canile, auouched by Madaſima, & the aged Giantes her Mother. And yet notwithſtanding, vnder what couller or pretence I know not, they haue dared to make their entrance, and (by treaſon) haue ſurprized both the Towne and Caſtell of the Burning Lake, where wee planted the Count Latin as our Vicegerent, whom they yet detaine as priſoner, and many more with him. This hath raiſed their courage to ſuch a height of arrogancie, that they hold Fortune to be onely their Goddeſſe, and that ſhe (with them) will beate vs hence, euen home to our owne houſes, whereto it appeareth they will likewiſe lay claime, to order them and vs by their own diſpoſition. But you ſhall ſee it fall out quite contrary; for, the reputation wherein wee haue ſo long time liued, and the hand of Heauen (I am aſſuredly perſwaded) will not ſuffer vs to be diſgraced by them. For I dare engadge mine honour, that there is no one man among ye, but will rather dye with credit and vertuous repute, then liue in obloquie and deteſted ſhame. And ſuch perfect acknowledgement I haue had

of you for many yeares together; that I muſt iuſtly confeſſe, I haue no meane occaſion both to loue and highly eſteeme ye. And if I had receiued no ſuch knowledge of ye, yet it cannot be denied, but that from the very houre of my birth, Fortune ſtrictly engadged me to yee all: as well in regard of the ſidelitie, euer-more continued by ye to your former Princes, as alſo for the manifold ſeruices done by yee to me in diuers places.

All which reaſons haue grounded this beleefe in me, that, without reſpect to ſome particulars, who haue entred into rebellion againſt vs, being heeretofore our friends, and now coueting the beſt and deareſt blood in your bodies: you will declare ſuch zeale in dutie, (according to your auncient vertue and faithfulneſſe) that we ſhall let them ſoon perceiue, how fondly they haue oppoſed themſelues againſt vs. And that ſhall we very eaſily doe, being farre aboue them in number, and that which is beyond all things elſe, the right being on our ſide: So let vs boldly marche on to meet them; foryee ſee how forward they are to the field.
                  While the King was thus buſied in theſe remouſtrances, Galuanes ſate not idlely downe on the other ſide but being in the midſt of his battalions, went from ranke to rank, perſuading his knightsto fight manfully, & vſing theſe or the like ſpeeches to them.
                  Vnderſtand, my deare friends and companions in Armes, that the chiefe and moſt ſoueraigne happines, that can be in any Army what-ſoeuer, is, to haue one ſole Head or Commaunder, whoſe wiſedome in ordinances, and counſell in things requiſite to bee done, may compaſſe obedience for the execution of his command. Now, it is apparent that yee haue not heere one Captaine onely, and ſuch a man as I haue noted to yee: but two or three, yea, more then twentie, who are all ſo ſweetly linked together, as if it were but one will, one heart, and one aduice. Seeing then, that this prime felicity is not wanting to vs; let vs appropriate our ſelues to the ſecond, and helpe forward my fortune, in ayding vs againſt a King, the moſt ingratefull man of the world: who maketh full account to ruinate our goods and liues with a great and powerfull Army brought hither againſt vs, onely to impoueriſh, and exterminate the right of a ſilly Gentlewoman. But he may come ſhort in his account; for we will aide and maintaine her cauſe, ſo long as life remaineth in our bodies; according to our oath and promiſe, whereto we obliged our ſelues when we receiued the order of knighthood. But if we dye with this attempt, it ſhall be to vs immortall glory, that wee had ſo iuſt occaſion to fight againſt him, who ought to deſend the right of all Ladies. So that, that which (in many men) may be tearmed raſhnes or preſumption, in vs will be truely

with ſuch height of ſpirit, a matter almoſt incredible to men.
                  Such were the words of the gentle knight Galuanes to his followers; which animated them ſo ſprightfully, as they imagined the time ouertardied, till they were at fight. But Quedragant required a little longer reſpit; And in the mean while (quoth he) I hold it very expedient, that we ſhould ſend to King Liſuart, and aduiſe him, that if hee expect any honour in fighting with vs: that hee would withdraw his Archers, as we will doe ours, by which meanes, it will be the faireſt forme of battell among knights, that euer was ſeene. This aduice was well liked by the whole company, and Elian the Deliberate had the charge of this meſſage. Whereupon he went to the Campe of King Liſuart, giuing his ſigne afarre off, that he came to conferre. Galaor, who ledde the auantguard, ſent a Gentleman to meete him, and conduct him ſurely. Being brought to the King, he made knowen what the knights of the Encloſed Iſland had commaunded him. In good ſooth, anſwered the King, I am very well pleaſed with their motion, and bidde them not faile in doing their vttermoſt. So Elian returned, and informed Galuanes, who had likewiſe diuided his Army into two parts.
                  But they were ouer few, in reſpect of the Kings power, which conſiſted of ſix times as many men more, and yet they were not daunted or diſmayed. Only they grieued for the want of Brian de Moniaſte, who was taken priſoner on the day that they aſſayled King Arban; and for Agrayes alſo, who was gone to leuie men, and make prouiſion of victuals from little Brittaine. Theſe two battailes being ranged, and ready for fight, they marched each againſt other in this manner. For them of the Encloſed Iſland, the auantguard was led by Floreſtan, accompanied with two hundred and fifty knights, beſide Quearagant, Angriote and Sarquiles; among whom alſo was Gaſinan, bearing a goodly great Enſigne, wherein were figured twelue Ladies. Next marched Galuanes, Palomir, Dragonts, Liſtoran, and foure hundred other knights, all worthy men, and reſolued to fight.
                  Then Drummes, Trumpets and Clarions ſounded on either ſide ſo chearefully, that the ayre returned backe as gallant an eccho: & as they were vpon ioyning, Galaor, who led the vauward for King Liſuart, ſhewing to Norandell, Floreſtan, Quedragant; Angriote, and Garnate, ſaide. My friendly companion, marke well theſe foure firſt that marche hither-ward ſo brauely, aſſure your ſelfe, that they are reputed among the beſt knights in the world. Hee that beares his Shielde Gules, with three Lyons Argent, is my Brother Floreſtan. The other that beares azure, ſeamed with Floures and Lyons Ore, is Quedragant. The third that beares Azure, with ſo many floures Argent, is Angriote. And the fourth who beareth all Sinople, is Garnate of the Dreadfull Dale: hee ſlew a mighty Serpent, and therfore was that name impoſed on him. Let vs therefore charge them boldly, without any thought of difference. So placing their Launces in their reſts, and giuing ſpur to their horſes, they entred pell mell. The firſt that Norandell encountred, was Garnate of the Dreadful Dale, to whom he gaue ſuch a ſalutation with his Launce, that his Saddle girts breaking, he fell downe backward with the Saddle. This was the firſt bold aduenture that euer Norandel made which cauſed his eſtimation after-ward

to be the more glorious. Galaor was the next to him, againſt whom ran Quedragant, and met each other with ſuch maine violence, that they lay both ouerthrown on the ground, and their horſes vpon them.
                  Then began the fight to be dreadfull & cruell, and ſuch was the noiſe of ſtrokes deliuered on either ſide, the ſound of Trumpets, and the outcrys of men; that it was a mater moſt ſtrange & fearefull to heare. Knights lay ouerthrowen & wounded on the earth, in heapes together; and they that had beheld the fight betweene Galaor and Quedragant, after they 
                        •…
                     ce recouered footing, might eaſily haue iudged, how little fauour they meant to each other. And as they declared themſelues worthy renowne for deedes of Armes, euen ſo did Norandel, Guillan and the reſt make good the like: But Angriote and Floreſtan reſiſted each other in ſuch ſort, as neither of them could gaine the leaſt iote of aduantage, &, which was more; meanes was made to remount Quedragant, while the other withdrew Galaor out of the throng. Then came in king Cildadan with his troups, who did ſet thē all to ſuch ſerious imployment, as if Galuanes had not bin ſuddenly ſuccoured, there had bin no means for further reſiſtance. And yet Floreſtan was in the midſt of the croud, laying on all ſides ſo valiantly about him; that he wel deſerued, to be ranked among the beſt knights of the world; for heperformd ſuch deeds of arms, as all were glad to giue him way.
                  Now as he continued his trauerſing among the rankes, he chanced to meete with King Cildadan, who made much hauocke among his followers: in regard wherof, he caught him faſt about the body, purpoſing to lay him along on the ground, but the other held firme footing, and they ſtroue together ſo extreamely, that the fall hapned equall to them both. Notwithſtanding, they were vp againe quickly, with their ſwords faſtened in their hands, and as they hacked and hewed each other; Angriote d'Eſtrauaux, and Enill came in to them, and gaue aſſiſtance to Floreſtan, that in deſpight of Galaor and Norandel, (who ſeemed to come to the reſcue of king Cildadan) they ſet him on his horſe againe. In which time Cildadan retired, for he was ſore wounded on the head, with a ſtroke that Dragonis gaue him with a ſword.
                  At this time King Liſuarts men beganne to haue the worſt, ſo that the moſt part of them turned their backs, and took themſelues to flight: but they met the king and his guard, that came to aſſiſt them, and he made meanes to ſtay them. Neuertheleſſe, beholding this diſorder, he became ſo amazed, that hee ſaid to Grumedan; Shall all the honour of Great Brittaine, be now ſhaken and weakned, by a poor handful of ſpent & tired men? So claſping down the beuer of his Helmet, and couering himſelf with his Shield, he gaue the ſpur to his horſe, crying aloud to his men. Is this a time for flight? follow me, follow me men of courage, & let vs ratheer dy together, then fly to our own ſhame. So entred he among the thickeſt of his enemies, & the firſt he met withall was Galuanes, to whom hee gaue ſuch a ſhocke with a ſhort Lance, that he made him bend in the back, & drawing forth his ſword like an angry Lyon, he entred the preaſe, performing ſuch deeds of armes, as no knight could do more. But Quedragant, Floreſtan, Angriote & Garnate came, who ouerthrew him, and beat back his people couragiouſly.
                  Now beganne King Liſuart to imagine, that Fortune turned her backe vpon him, and meeting with

                     Arban, Grumedan and Gaſquilan, hee ſaid vnto them. I feare that heauen intendeth puniſhment vpon vs: but I had rather be tearmed a dead King with honour, then (being foyled) to liue with ſhame. And ſo he entred into the wood, where ſeeing what ſpoyle was made by Quedragant and his men, hee charged him with all his might, and gaue him ſuch a wound on the head, that the blood ran downe all about his face. And ſurely, hee had beene in very great danger of life, but for Angriote and Floreſtan, who thruſt in betweene them; and as they laboured in his defence, king Liſuarts Sword entred the flanke of Floreſtans horſe, ſo that hee fell downe dead vnder him. But Floreſtan quickly reuenged this iniury, for in recouering himſelfe, he ſo hought king Liſuarts horſe, that he was glad to forgo his Stirrops, and in diſmounting, gaue ſuch a ſtroake to Floreſtan on the head, that both aſtouned, & ſhreudly wounded him. Notwithſtanding, Floreſtan was not thus to bee diſcouraged, but beholding the king ready againe to charge him with his Sword, he vnder-ranne the blow; and catching him about the midle, ſeazed his Sword, by which meanes he might eaſily haue ſlaine him if he would: but he refuſed that aduantage ſo freely offered him, which afterward prooued to his owne harme.
                  
                     Galaor beholding the king in ſo great danger, ruſhed ſuddenly in, and without reſpect to brother, or any other kinſman, behaued him-ſelfe ſo boldly, that in deſpight of Floreſtan, he recouered the king out of his hands, and remounted him on horſebacke againe, by the helpe of Norandell, Grumedan, and ſome others, which gaue freſh encouragement to the knights of Great Brittaine, ſo that they which before fled away with feare, ſtood to it now more reſoluedly then euer. So turning head vpon their enemies, who (hauing loſt Floreſtan and Quedragant, that were among the dead bodies) became ſo weakened in their ſtrength, as they were conſtrayned to retire: for euen Galuanes himſelf was ſo grieuouſly wounded, as hee was no longer able to ſit on horſe-backe. Neuertheleſſe, like a diſcreete and hardie knight, vntill his people had gained the hill, he ſtood vpon his beſt guard, wi
                        •…
                      
                     Palomir, Elian, Branfill, Enill, and Sarquiles, who were all (in the end) taken priſoners: And had it not beene for Dragonis, who forcibly recouered Galuanes, he had remained among the reſt.
                  Thus the king obtayned the victory, by vertue of his courage, and the fauour of Floreſtan, who hauing him in his power, became enemy to his owne good fortune. For ſhe is ſuch an inconſtant Miſtreſſe, as will haue no man to let ſlip aduantage againſt his contrarie, leſt ſhee turne her backe, and frowne at his folly, as ſhe did to Floreſtan. For if hee had ſlaine king Liſuart, when in heate of blood (with tollerable excuſe) hee might haue done it; the honor of the day had falne to him and his friends aſſuredly, which therefore thus hee loſt, to their ſhame and confuſion, as formerly hath beene related.
                  
                     Galuanes & his aſſociats, being retired among the mountaines, keeping very circumſpectly al the wayes & paſſages: king Liſuart commanded the retreat to be ſounded, and pitched his Tents in the ſame place where hee had wonne the victory. But as Galaor returned from purſuit of his enemy, hee eſpyed his Brother Floreſtan and Quedragant lying among the ſlaughtered bodies:

whereat he conceiued ſuch inward griefe, that he was ready to fall beſide his horſe. Being alighted, and perceiuing in them no motion of life at all; his complaints were ſo pitifull and extreame, that euery eye did much compaſſionate him, and the King was made acquainted with his heauy caſe. Whereupon, immediatly hee mounted on horſe-back, not for any good-will to Floreſtan or Quedragant, but onely to comfort Galaor, whom hee loued moſt intirely. And yet notwithſtanding all his malice, he conſidered, as he rode along, what daunger Floreſtan did thruſt himſelfe into, on the day of battaile againſt King Cildadan, and that (but for him) he had beene wounded to death by Gandacuriel, as already hath beene at large declared. In remembrance whereof, he deſired to ſaue his life, if poſſible it might be; and therefore, ſo ſoone as he came to them, he commanded their bodies to be carried into one of his Tents, and that his own Phiſitions and Chirurgions, ſhould look diligently to their wounds.
                  Vpon ſight and ſearch made, according to their skill and experience, they found their hurts to bee very dangerous, but not deadly: for at their firſt dreſsing, they found ſuch hopefull ſignes of recouery, that they vndertook (within certain dayes) to warrant their cure. Galaor on this comfortable pērſwaſion, left them to their reſt and quiet, and went to the King, who was ſet in Councell, demaunding the opinion of his knights, what further was to be done againſt his enemies, declaring what daunger might enſue, by admitting them to gather freſh ſupply and ſtrength, and that it would be both honour and profit, to 
                        •
                     old on ſtill the purſuit of victory. For, quoth hee, I am very certaine, that Agrayes is gone to leuie men in little Brittaine, and that hee will come quickly with new aſſiſtance: wherefore I hold it moſt neceſſary, ſpeedily to follow on them, not ſuffering them to take hart or breathing; and hauing now ſo good meanes to doe, let vs take the benefit of ſo apt an oportunity.
                  To this aduice all the knights condiſcended without contradiction in any one; and hereupon it was reſolued, that each man ſhould bee in readines the next morning, ſo ſoone as the Trumpet gaue forth ſummons, which was performed accordingly, But they met with ſtouter reſiſtance then they expected; for Dragonis, with ſo ſmall a company of men as he had with him, had ſo fortified the paſſage, and maintained it ſo manfully, that a great number of them were ſore wounded, before they could get the leaſt meanes of entrance. Notwithſtanding, in the end, he was faine to leaue it, and ſeeke for ſafety in the Fortreſſe of the Burning Lake: but thither he was purſued, and there beſieged both by Sea and land, to keep them off the Towne from iſſuing forth, and to cut off all hope of ſuccour, which they continually awayted from little Brittaine.
                  
                  But becauſe it would be a matter too prolixe and tedious, to report all the skirmiſhes and attempts which they had againſt each other during the ſiege, and it being a thing very litle appertaining to out hiſtory, which tendeth onely to the actions of Amadis, who remained now in Gaule with his Father King Perion: Let it ſuffiſe yee, that after the ſiege had continued 3, moneths and more, two things were the cauſe of bringing them to accorde. The one becauſe they of the

Towne had receiued Letters from Agrayes, that hee lay ſicke in little Brittaine, by which meanes he could not leuy competent forces to their expectation. The other, becauſe King Liſuart reciued aduertiſement from his Vncle Count Argamont, that ſeuen of his neighbour Kings, had made great prouiſion for the inuading of his kingdome, which required ſuch care, as needfully therto belonged. This aduice likewiſe gaue further intelligence, that Archalaus the Enchanter, was the onely meanes heereof: becauſe he had perſwaded them to this attempt, vpon the aduantage of King Liſuarts abſence at the Burning Lake, and the ſmall ſtore of knights remaining then in Great Brittaine.
                  
                  When King Liſuart heard theſe newes, hee conſulted with his thoughts, what was beſt to be done; and after much diſcourſe with his owne minde, he concluded, to take compoſition with Galuanes, if hee would but propound it. And it fell out ſo fortunatly, that the very ſame day, deſire of conference was vrged by the other ſide, with offer of rendring the place. Prouided, that the king would permit him and his people freely to depart, and ſuch priſoners as hee deteyned, with an agreement of truce for two whole yeares, if he liked to allow thereof. Vpon many entercourſes paſſing on either ſide; the offer was accepted, and truce concluded, ſo that the King (the very ſame day) entred the Towne.
                  And as Madaſima preſented him the keyes, humblie caſting her ſelfe at his feete, teares ſtreaming abundantly from her eyes, ſhe ſaid. Alas Sir, if euer pitty found place in your Princely breſt, let it now appeare, and take compaſſion on a poore diſ-inherited Lady.
                  This humiliation of hers, wonne ſuch power in all the knights there preſent, as there was no one of them but gladly made tender of his ſeruice in her behalfe. Eſpecially Galaor, who vndertook the mater for her ſpeaking thus to the King. Vpon my faith Sir, reſpect in this caſe is very needfully required, and if euer in my life I did yee any acceptable ſeruice, let me now humbly entreate and to my vttermoſt poſſibility, that (for my ſake) you would be gracious to her. Truſt me Galaor, anſwered the King, if I ſhould recompence your high deſeruings, the Exchequer of all my vttermoſt, were not able to doe it. So calling Galuanes, hee thus proceeded. Galuanes, at the requeſt of Galaor; and hoping, withall, that heereafter you wil acknowledge the fauour I afford ye: I giue this Country to you and Madaſima, which (againſt my liking) you haue vſurped, and now (againſt your will) is to me rendred. See therfore, that hereafter you declare your ſelues to bee better aduiſed, & both you & yours to vſe homage & fidelity to me, according as you ought to do in duty.
                  Moſt humbly did Galuanes giue thankes to the King, ſwearing inſtantly the oath of alleageance; and the, Army hauing taken refreſhing for the ſpace of ſeuen or eight daies, the King commanded preparation to depart thence. So on the Sunday following, earely in the morning after Maſſe, they went aboord their Shippes, accompanied with Galuanes, and many more to take their farewell. Ankers being weighed, & their ſayles hoyſed, they ſet forth to the maine Sea; the windes ſeruing them ſo proſperouſly, that in fewe dayes (without any diſaſter) they arriued in the Porte and hauen of Gra
                           •
                        edonia, where the Queene and Ladies wayted and

attended in expectation of their returne. And there (for this time) will we leaue them together, and declare what happened to Amadis, who abode in Gaule, to heare tydings from them.
               
               
                  CHAP. V.
                  
                     How Amadis, being with his Father King Perion, found himſelfe ſubiect to ouermuch melancholy, to be ſo farre ſundered from his Oriana. And contrarywiſe, Bruneo was highly contented, hauing ſo apt occaſiſion, to ſee and conferre with his Melicia, at what time himſelfe pleaſed: And of their ſeuerall enterpriſes, to ſatisfie their owne humours and fancies.
                  
                  
                     AFter that King Cildadan and Galaor had left Amadis in Gaule, he became much more ſolitary then euer hee had beene: for the company of Bruneo was now grown incōpatible to him, being ſo diuerſly intreated in their affections. Becauſe Bruneo enioyed (almoſt) whatſoeuer his ſoule deſired, beholding daylie the Princeſſe Melicia, whom he ſo dearely affected, that all things elſe ſlipt beſide his remembrance. On the contrary, Amadis being ſo far diſtant from his Oriana, all pleaſures whatſoeuer were to him irkeſome and tedious: which cauſed him to refraine all company, the better to conforme himſelfe to ſolitude. It chanced on a day, being walking alone, (his Squire onely excepted) in the Forreſt, and neare to the Sea ſide: hee caſt his eye towards Great Brittain, and eſpyed a Ship making in to the Port, which Ship hee ſuppoſed to come from London; whereupon hee preſently commanded Gandalin, to goe know of whence it was, and hee ſeated himſelf (in the meane while) vnder a ſpreading Tree, to enter into his wonted lamentations. Leaning his head vpon his left arme, and ſending a pittious looke towards the Country, where formerly he had found ſuch ſweete entertainment: breathing foorth a vehement ſigh, thus he began.
                  Poore vnfortunate Amadis, is it poſſible for thee to continue long in this torment? Alas, if Loue heeretofore was fauourable to thee, he now makes thee pay too deare vſury for it. What ſaid I? Loue? O no, it is not Loue, not is Loue the cauſe thereof: but mine owne miſ-fortune, that being enuious of thy ſweete eaſe and felicity, forged and enforced the Kings diſcontentment, therby to be thy vtter ruine, by loſſe of her ſight, on whom depended thy life and onely happines, which is a burden more vnſupportable for thee to beare, then if a thouſand deathes were impoſed on thee together. But no beatitude is deſtinied to me, and I may well bee aſhamed to wiſhe it, conſidering, Oriana would be too much offended thereby. Why then ſhall I couet any ſuch euill, ſhe neuer affoording mee but grace and fauour? For the very leaſt ſadneſſe that I can ſuffer, ſhee feeles it euen as ſenſibly as mine owne ſoule. Theſe complaints were accompanied with ſuch floods of teares, that maine riuolets ranne downe his cheekes, leauing him vnable (along while) to vtter foorth one word.
                  
                     
As hee continued in theſe paſſions, a dart flewe hard by his eare, whereof hee tooke no care, ſo much was his minde addicted elſewhere. But Gandalin returning then towards him, eſpied (in a buſhie thicket) a Gianteſſe of immeaſurable ſtature, preparing to let flye another dart at his Maſter: whereupon hee cryed out aloud to him; and Amadis ſuddenly ſtarting, demanded the reaſon of his clamour. Why Maſter, quoth he, doe yee not ſee yonder deuil, that endeauors to wound yee. And ſo ſhewed him the Gianteſſe, towards whom Amadis directed his ſteppes; but ſhe fled away thwart the Forreſt, running as ſwiftly as a Hart, and (in her flight) recouered Amadis his horſe, whereon mounting her ſelfe, ſhe thus cryed out. Know Amadis, that I am thine ancient enemy Andadone, the Gianteſſe of the Sad Iſle: who tels thee plainely, that if I cannot compaſſe mine intent, yet time ſhall let thee know how much I loue thee.
                  When Amadis perceiued, that it was a woman whom hee had purſued, he would follow her no further: but commaunded Gandalin to doe it, and to kill her if he could. Gandalin obeyed his Lords command, and laboured earneſtly till he ouer-tooke her. In which time, as Amadis was ſitting downe againe vnder the tree, with intent to recommence his former complaints: hee eſpyed Enill, otherwiſe called Durin, whom Gandalin had found abord the Ship, that his Maſter had ſent before to enquire of. Whereupon Amadis ranne and embraced him, demaunding what good newes hee had brought from Great Brittaine. My Lord, (quoth he,) Madame Oriana moſt kindly commends her ſelfe to ye, and ſends ye this Letter; which inſtantly he deliuered to him. Amadis perceiuing that ſhe repoſed truſt in Enill, bade him diſcouer what ſhe had further commaunded him. My Lord (anſwered Enill) ſhe intirely entreateth you, that you would grieue ſo little as poſſible may be in this Country, and not to depart hence, vntill you ſhall heare further tydings from her. And ſhe alſo certifies you by me, that your linage is encreaſed, by the birth of a gallant ſweet Sonne, which my Siſter and I haue conueyed to ſafe nurſing: but he w̄as wary enough in diſcouering the maner of his loſſe. Great was the ioy and comfort of Amadis, to vnderſtand ſuch pleaſing newes from Oriana, howbeit, her command that he ſhould not part thence, was ſomewhat irkſome to him: becauſe it might bee preſumed by ſiniſter iudgments, that either neglect, or lack of courage, had driuen him to this retired kinde of life. Neuertheleſſe, happen whatſoeuer might to him, hee concluded, not to tranſgreſſe a iote of her charge and command.
                  As Enill had ended his diſcourſe, Gandalin returned, who had ſlaine the Gianteſſe, and brought her head hanging at his ſaddle bow. Amadis was very glad to behold it, and deſired to know in what manner he had done it. My Lord, quoth Gandalin, I purſuing her very cloſely, and ſhee gallopping on the horſe which ſhe had ſtollen from you, as hoping to ſhippe her ſelfe before I ſhould ouertake her: the poore horſe was ſo weake in the backe, being ouercharged with the loade of ſo huge a deuill; as I imagined, hee had broken his neck with falling downe vnder her. At which apt opportunity, I inſtantly arriued, and before ſhe had power to recouer her ſelfe, I was her deaths-man, as this teſtimony there-of may well witneſſe to ye. By my

troth, ſaid Amadis, this will bee a goodly preſent for Bruneo; therfore wee will returne to the Court, and there ſhalt thou haue the honour of deliuering it. As for thee, my deare friend Enill, without being ſeene any where elſe, I would haue thee returne to my gracious Princeſſe, and giue her to know, that I moſt humbly thanke her for her Letter, as alſo for thy further meſſage from her. But yet I entreate, her to take ſome pitty and reſpect on mine honor, in compelling me to leade an idle life here: Neuertheleſſe, I will be obedient to her in any thing, and all my dayes are dedicated ſolely to her ſeruice. And yet I very well know, that no man can (by vertue) winne himſelfe ſuch renowne and reputation; but time and mens malice, will diſgrace him on the very leaſt occaſion offered. Goe then in Gods Name, to whoſe ſafe protection I commend thee, and doe my humble duty to my ſacred Goddeſſe.
                  So returned Enill to his Shippe, and Amadis to the Court to his friend Bruneo, who was much better healed of his late receiued hurt, then of his old loue-ſicke languiſhing, the fire whereof ſtill more and more encreaſed the flame of his torment. Which he well perceiuing, and that he could not (as yet) reach the height of his intent, without much loſſe of time and hard endeauour, as a purgation to ſuch ſlothful negligence, and the better to enlarge his knighthoods reputation, he reſolued to viſite ſtrange Countries, in ſearch of aduentures, and to accompliſh ſuch actions of Armes, that his fame might ſpeake it ſelfe in all places. Hereupon, ſo ſoone as the Gianteſſe head had bin ſhewen him, Amadis and he walking aſide together, he thus ſpake. Truſt me my Lord, the youth of my yeares, and the ſlender eſteem whereinto I haue hitherto liued, eſpecially among knights of fame and merit, doth inſtantly incite me, to forſake this loytring life of eaſe and pleaſure, and vndergoe another more painful, yet profitable, to ranke my ſelfe with men of ſo high eſtimatiō. And therfore I humbly beſech you, that if you haue any diſpoſition to ſeeke after aduentures, you would be pleaſed to accept of my company, or elſe to licence my departure alone, for I muſt bee gone to morrow morning very earely.
                  When Amadis heard theſe words, and remembred the iniunction, ſo ſtrictly impoſed on him by the Letter from Oriana, which Enill formerly had brought him; he grew extreamely offended: yet both diſſembling his diſtemper, and excuſing himſelfe to Bruneo, he thus anſwered. Beleeue me (deare Friend) I haue (all my life-time) beene deſirous of ſuch company as yours; being well aſſured, that nothing but honour and happines could then happen to me. But the conference I haue had ſo lately with the King, and his ſtrict impoſition, for my not leauing his Country as yet, abridgeth me of your aſſociation, then which nothing can be more diſpleaſing to me. Wherefore I deſire you to hold me excuſed, not doubting, but that the hand of Heauen will euery where defend ye.
                  
                     Bruneo ſeeing himſelfe thus diſpatched by Amadis, went to viſite Melicia, whom he acquainted with the reaſon of his ſudden departing: entreating her to continue gracious vnto him, becauſe hee preferred her fauour before all things elſe whatſoeuer. Melicia diſcreetly anſwered him, that ſhee muſt wholly encline her will, according as pleaſed the King and Queene, to

diſpoſe of her: aſſuring him neuertheleſſe, that he was the Gentleman, whom (before all other) ſhee could willingly accept as her husband, if ſo be it ſtood as well with their liking. As he and ſhee continued this conference, taking gracious and amiable farewells of each other: the king entred, to whom Bruneo addreſſing himſelfe, he declared the occaſion of his departure. Which the King allowed to bee both good and reaſonable; and becauſe it grew ſome-what late, and a ſeaſonable houre for reſt and repoſe: all was referred till the next morning, for more ample parting diſcourſe. Bright day no ſooner beganne to appeare, but Bruneo armed himſelfe at all points, afterward, going to heare Maſſe deuoutely. And as hee was ready to mounte on horſebacke, the King and Amadis came to him, conducting him forth of the Citie, where they committed him to God and all good fortune: wherein it ſeemed he prooued ſo proſperous, that (in ſhort time) hee finiſhed ſo many rare aduentures, as would require larger ſcope then heere is limited; beſide it is not materiall to the purpoſe which wee labour to continue.
                  Returne we therefore to Amadis, who hauing already ſoiourned in Gaule three moneths and an halfe, while King Liſuart made his warre in the Iſle of Mongaza, and his reputation being much diminiſhed, by his diſcontinuance from Armes, ſo that euery tongue babled to his diſaduantage: eſpecially Ladies and Damoſels, who came from all parts in queſt of him, and not finding him, returned ſo highly diſcontented, that they laide on him many blamefull imputations, which came continually to his eare. Neuertheleſſe, for any reſpect in the world whatſoeuer, he would not diſobey the command of the Princeſſe Oriana: but rather choſe to vndergo thoſe taxations of diſgrace, till King Liſuart returned into Great Brittaine again. Who receiued tydings at his arriuall, that his enemies were already paſſed into the Iſle of Lionine, and euen vpon entrance into his Country. Now, albeit he appeared to make ſmall reckoning thereof before his own people, as being fearefull to diſtaſte them; yet afterward, his minde was farre otherwiſe buſied. But eſpecially the Queene was much moued, greatly bemoaning the abſence of Amadis, and thoſe that went away with him, ſpeaking it publikely; that if the King had them now in his ſeruice, and as ready at his command, as they were wont to be; he might aſſure himſelfe of the victory.
                  And if the Queene were ſo diſcontented, what ſhall wee thinke of Oriana and Mabila? who as they ſate deuiſing together, ſpake of the knights then abſent from the Kings ſeruice, onely through his wrongs done to Amadis and his followers, ſo that Mabila ſaid to the Princeſſe. Madame, although the King hath runne into an errour, it followes not, that you ſhould doe the like, eſpecially in matters ſo much importing you. Me thinks you ſhould rather ſend to my Couſin, and preuent all occaſions that may offend him, earneſtly entreating him, that if he will not ſtand for the King; yet (at leaſt) he will not be againſt him, in the hope you haue one day to be his heire and Ladie of his Countries, which then may ſucceede to him by your coniunction in marriage. Send therefore ſome meſſage that may content him, and if hee be diſpleaſed at his ſo long abiding in Gaule, let him elſewhere recreate his

ſpirits, till time and fortune ſend a ſeaſon more fit for your deſires.
                  
                     Oriana liked well this friendly aduice, and wrote immediatly to Amadis (by a Damoſell)) that newly had brought her diuers preſents from the Queene Eliſena) all that ſhe and Mabila had concluded together, and by her Letter fully acquainted him therewith. Whereat he was not a little ioyfull, being now at liberty to go where himſelfe liſted. And yet he was in ſome perplexitie, not knowing readily what to determine. For it was the wil of Oriana, that hee ſhould not ſerue againſt King Liſuart, and to lend him any aſſiſtance, was as much againſt his own minde. To reconcile theſe two extreames, hee reſolued to vſe the aduice of King Perion, & finding him one day at conuenient leiſure, walking along by the Sea ſide; as they were entring into the purpoſed diſcourſe: they eſpyed (afarre off) a knight ryding towards them, mounted vpon a bay Courſer, but ſo ſpent and wearie, that hee was ſcarce able to endure any trauaile. The knights Armour, Shield and Coate of Armes, were bruiſed and battered, that it was (almoſt) impoſſible to take knowledge of him: and yet King Perion gathered by his outward appearance, that he was ſome knight errant, wherefore he ſtepped forward to welcome him, and Amadis looking aduiſedly on him, knew him to bee his brother Floreſtan, whereupon he ſaid to the King (who had neuer ſeene him.) Sir, know you not this knight? hee is one of the beſt in all the world, and your Son. My Son? anſwered the King. Yes truely (quoth Amadis) it is Floreſtan, of whom I haue remembred you many times.
                  
                     Floreſtan beholding Amadis, began to coniecture, that the other was King Perion: wherefore diſmounting ſuddenly from his horſe, the King came to embrace him, and he kneeled downe to kiſſe his feete, but King Perion would not permit it, taking him vp louingly in his armes, ſaying, he was moſt heartily welcome. Then taking him by the hand, they walked on towards the Caſtell to the Queene: who gaue him moſt gracious entertainment, as well for the Kings ſake, as for his renowned fame thorow all Countries. And as they conferred together on the fortunes of King Liſuart, king Perion ſaid vnto him, Son, haue ye heard of his enemies enterpriſe againſt him? I haue Sir (replyed Floreſtan) and for ought I can collect to the contrary, their power is ſo ſtrong, as, if heauen be not fauourable, impoſſible is the vtter-moſt of his reſiſtance, whereat wee haue little reaſon to be ſorry, conſidering how matters haue been paſt. Sonne, quoth the king, I can eaſily beleeue, that king Liſuart hath fayled in ſome occaſions; neuertheleſſe, I haue often heard him commended for diuers good vertues: which perſwadeth me, that this buſines may fall out as ſucceſſefull for him, as many others heeretofore haue done. Moreouer, it ill becommeth any king, to wiſh or deſire the ruine of another, except he make warre againſt him, vpon ſome vniuſt occaſion.
                  It began now to waxe ſomewhat late, and the Tables were couered for Supper, wherefore the king ſaid to Amadis: Sonne, conduct your Brother, and ſee him diſarmed, then bring him to ſupp
                        •
                      with vs. So Amadis and Floreſtan withdrew them-ſelues, and being alone, Floreſtan thus ſpake. My Lord, the maine and principall occaſion that drew me into Gaule, was to aduertiſe you

of the wrong which you doe not onely to your ſelfe, but likewiſe to all your race and kinred, continuing ſo long a time 
                        •…
                     full, and careleſſe of Armes, whereby many tongues are liberall in your diſgrace, and iudge (that being become faint-hearted) you are growen altogether negligent. In good faith, anſwered Amadis, they may iudge as they pleaſe: but I hope heereafter, to cauſe them alter their bad opinion of me. As they held on this diſcourſe, the King came, and had them with him into the Haule, where refreſhing themſelues with variety of viandes, the Tables were at length with-drawen, and a due houre came to goe to reſt; Amadis and Floreſtan taking their leaue of the King for that night.
                  But Amadis being vnable to ſleep, his thoughts laboured continually, how he might recouer the credit he had loſt: concluding with himſelfe to runne a contrary bias, to the raſh ſpeeches rumorde out againſt him. And that he might the better attain thereto, one while hee determined to goe againſt king Liſuart: but ſuddenly (remembring the prohibition of his Lady Oriana) hee became quite changed, not knowing (on either ſide) how to make his election. Till after a long combate with his priuate cogitations, hee thought it beſt to forget the iniuries done him in Great Brittaine, and to take part with the King, as well in regard that his ſide was the weaker, as alſo, if he ſhould ſuſtain the foile, Oriana might loſe all hope of euer being his, or he hers. Heereupon, hee roſe very earely the next morning, and being accompanied with Floreſtan, entred the Kings Chamber, where finding him awake, they gaue him the good morrow, and Amadis ſpake thus.
                  Sir, all this night my minde hath endured much trauaile, about your conference with my Brother Floreſtan, the laſt euening, and concerning the daunger whereinto King Liſuart may fall, thorow the want of ſuccour. In theſe meditations I remembred alſo that duty, which (as you then ſaid euery vertuous Prince ſtands obliged vnto, to maintaine the rightfull liberties of another Prince, being wrongfully, and (vpon no iuſt occaſion) inuaded. In regard whereof, I am determined, if you thinke it conuenient, and will thereto licence me; goe into Great Brittaine, and without any regard of the wrongs I haue ſuſtayned, not onely to aſſiſt King Liſuart, but his ſubiects alſo, who ſtand no way guilty in his offence. And truſt me Sir, I vſe not theſe ſpeeches to yee, but vpon vrgent occaſion; for heere is my brother, who knowes what reproches are ſpred abroad of me; for hauing a while abſented my ſelfe from Armes: whereby it appeareth to many, that I am growne cold in the purſuite of aduentures, for the dangers elſewhere hapning, where-of I neuer dreamed. Therefore, that euery one may take true notice of me; if heauen be ſo pleaſed, I will in ſuch affaires make ſuch reall apparance of my duty, that my renown (which ſeemeth to lye buried) ſhall reuiue it ſelfe againe, and with much more glory then euer it yet gained.
                  Sonne (quoth the king) you well know, that I haue euer beene a louer of good men and goodneſſe, and perceiuing king Liſuart to bee one of that number. I haue iuſt cauſe to affoord him any ayde and fauour, whereſoeuer I am able to compaſſe the meanes. And if I ſhould deferre it this inſtant; the cauſe is eaſily knowen, onely the

difference betweene him and you. But ſeeing that your intention is changed, and that you will make one in ſo worthy a buſines: I will goe along with yee for company: grieuing at nothing elſe, but that the time is too ſhort for leuying our people. For if I had the leyſure to prepare an Army; aſſure your ſelfe, I would leade along with me a Royall aſſembly. But that defect ſhall not ſtay my preſent purpoſe. I will onely take ſuch knights as are readieſt for me, and ſo away vpon my iourney.
                  When Floreſtan heard this deliberation; hee ſtood ſilent a long while, as vnable to vtter a word, but at laſt; he ſaid to the King. By my faith, Sir, when I conſider the cruelty of king Liſuart, which (but for the fauour ſhewen to vs by Lord Galaor, in the Iſle of Mongaza) had coſt the deare price of all our liues: I hold it impoſſible for me, to doe or wiſhe him any good. Your Highneſſe is not ignorant, how long a time (before then) he deadly hated vs, many times making his vaunt, to bee the vtter ruine and extirpation of vs all. Neuertheleſſe, ſeeing matters ſtand on ſuch tearmes as now they doe: I am wel contented, both in the honor of you, and for you are thereto ſo nobly affected, to forget all iniuries at this time, and will follow you, as it is my duty to doe. Moreouer, by our agreement made at the Burning Lake, for the ſpace of two yeares, I may beare no armes againſt him, whereby I ſtand partly bound, that if I will bee ſeene at all in the action, I muſt needes bee for him.
                  Sir, ſaid Amadis, the beſt courſe that we can take then, is cloſely to purſue our enterpriſe, without any other company, then we three onely. For if our number ſhould be greater, whatſoeuer we can doe, will but deſerue the lateſt welcome: and therefore (if it, were poſſible) in mine opinion, wee would not willingly be knowne of any. Let it be ſo then, replied the king, I like the motion well, and I haue three Armours alike in all reſpects, very apt and proper to our intent, for our better knowledge and aſſiſting of one another; let vs goe preſently, and make proofe of them. So leauing the Chamber, they deſcended downe into the Court, where preſently entred before them, a Damoſell very richly attired, mounted on a beautifull Palfray, ſhee being accompanied with three Squires onely, each bearing a goodly ſquare. Cheſt before her, and the king thinking ſhe demaunded for him, went towards her with Amadis and Floreſtan, ſaluting her courteouſly, and demaunding if ſhee would ſpeake with the Queene. No Sir, quoth ſhe, my errand is onely to you, and theſe two knights, to whom I am ſent by the Lady of the Vnknowne Iſle, with theſe three preſents which heere you behold.
                  Then cauſing the cheſts to be ſet downe and opened, three Shieldes, three Helmets, and three Coat-Armours, were taken out of them. The Shields were Siluer, ſeamed all ouer with golden Serpents, ſo artificially wrought, that they appeared neere to life. The Coat-Armours were all alike, but the Helmets differed; for one was white, the other greene, and the third gold. The white was preſented by the Damoſell to the king, and the Coate-Armour thereto belonging; the green to Floreſtan, and the gold to Amadis, with theſe words. Sir, my Lady hath ſent you theſe Armes, and deſires you by me, that you will heere-after imploy them better, and your

ſelfe alſo, then (for too long a time) you haue done heere. Amadis hearing her ſo forward in ſpeech, ſtood in feare, leſt his loue affaires with Oriana ſhould be diſcouered: therefore, to breake her off from any further language in that kinde, hee anſwered. Faire Damoſell, I pray yee moſt humbly thanke your Lady on my behalfe, and tell her; I make much leſſe account of her counſell ſent me, then I doe of her preſent, which I will imploy according to my power.
                  My Lords, replyed the Damoſel, ſhe hath ſent armes to you all three, to the end, that you may know, and helpe one another (if need bee) in King Liſuarts warre. How? quoth the King, doth your Miſtreſſe know that we meane to be there, and wee our ſelues (within leſſe ſpace then an houre) did not ſo much as dream thereon? I know not that, anſwered the Damoſell, but ſhe aſſured mee, that (at this very houre) I ſhould finde yee all heere, and in this very place, further commanding me, that after I had deliuered ye theſe Arms, I ſhould paſſe hence into Great Brittaine, whither ſhe hath likewiſe ſent mee; wherefore bethinke your ſelues, if you will command me any ſeruice. Now truſt me Damoſell, (replyed the King) you ſhall not depart hence, vntill you haue dined. And ſo conducted her further into the Caſtel, where the beſt entertainment that could be deuiſed, was beſtowed on her. Hauing ſuſtayned Nature, and taken leaue of her three knights, ſhe ſet onward on her way to the Sea-ſide, and inſtantly imbarked her ſelfe.
                  After her departure, Amadis conſidered with himſelfe, that the day of battell was not farre off, and that (not without great cauſe) Vrganda had ſent them thoſe Armes: in regard whereof, his deſire grew much more earneſt to be there, then formerly it had done: and therefore to haſten the enterpriſe, he cauſed Gandalin (ſecretly) to prouide Shippint, wherewith acquainting both the King and Floreſtan, they reſolued to ſet away, the night enſuing. Being all aboord, the winde ſate ſo conueniently for them, that, vneſpied by any, they launched forth into the maine Sea, coaſting about the Iſle of Great Brittaine: where, very ſoon after, they landed ſo neere as poſſibly they might, to the place where the ſeauen Kings lay encamped: hoping, after they had once noted their diſpoſition, to ioyne them-ſelues with King Liſuart. And to that intent, they entred a Forreſt, where their Squires erected them a Pauillion, and where they attended more ample newes of the Army: ſending daylie one of their followers to the enemies Campe, to enquire when the day of battel ſhould be. Alſo they ſent another, to Galaor, by whom they gaue him to vnderſtand, that they were in Gaule. And the Squire had expreſſe charge to tell him, that he left them al three together, and earneſtly deſired, that (after the victory) hee would write to them, concerning his owne good health, and their other friends.
                  Wiſely did the Squires fulfill the charge committed to their truſt, ſo that on the third day following, the firſt returned to them, and reported, that the Army of the ſeauen Kings was very great and ſtrong, by reaſon of infinit numbers of ſtrangers, who were lately there arriued, and that they layed ſharpe ſiege to a Caſtell, which was ſaid to belong to certain Ladies. And albeit it was very ſtrong, and almoſt impregnable by power of Armes; yet they were in

great danger of yeelding it, becauſe food and ſuſtenance greatly fayled therein. And further (quoth the Squire) as I croſſed thorow the Campe, I heard Archalaus the Enchanter conferre with two of the Kings, ſaying, as hee walked along with them, that within ſixe dayes they would bid thē battel, becauſe no further order ſhould bee taken, for bringing them in any victuals by Sea, and that their munition began to fayle them alſo. Yet all goes well (anſwered Amadis) in the meane while, we ſhall haue good leiſure to refreſh and recreate our ſelues.
                  The very ſame day, the other Squire (ſent to the Campe of King Liſuart) returned likewiſe, who declared, that he met with Galaor, and what countenance hee ſhewed in reading the Letter. And truſt mee (quoth he) very hardly could he refraine from teares, when he vnderſtood, that you were all three in Gaule: for he made a ſetled aſſurance of the victory, if the King could haue enioyed yee in his company. Moreouer, he ſends ye word by me, that if hee eſcape with life from the field, he wil forthwith make haſte to ſee ye. But what (quoth Amadis) is thine opinion of their Army. Truſt me my Lord, (anſwered the Squire) ſo few fighting men as they be, yet are they al marſhalled in exceeding good order, and diuers worthy knights are ſaid to be among them: but they are all ouer few, in regard of the others mighty multitude. Notwithſtanding, King Liſuart is not daunted a iote: but intendeth (as I heard it credibly reported) within two dayes to meete them, or elſe the Caſtell of Ladies will be conſtrayned to yeeld it ſelfe, hauing no ſupply of men nor meate. Well, ſaid Amadis, we ſhall ſee what will enſue on this buſines.
                  Thus they continued in the Forreſt, vntill ſuch time as they had intelligence, that the two Armies prepared to ioyne: whereupon they diſlodged, and drew neerer to the Campe of King Liſuart, which was ſeated on the ridge of an hill, and ſo neere to the enemy, that but a little Riuer diuided them, running thorow the plaine, where King Aranigne (earneſtly deſirous of fight) had paſſed his men. This King laſt mentioned to ye, was choſen the chïefe; and Coronall of the whole Army: belonging to the ſeauen Kings, and to him all the principall Captaines of the band, had made ſolemne oath and promiſe the day before, to obey him without any contradiction. For he deſired nothing elſe (as he ſaid) neither could haue any iote more; but onely the honour of the enterpriſe: referring all the ſpoyle and booty to his companions, & the common Souldiers. And that he might the better accō
                     pliſh his intent, he ordained nine battalions, in each of which hee appointed twelue thouſand knights: reſeruing to his owne charge, fifteen hundred, and more, commaunding on the morrow (by breake of day) the Trumpets & Clarions to giue ſummons, for all to ſet themſelues in order, and bee in readineſſe. Before he would diſlodge, ſeeing his men forward to their deuoire: for their encouragement, he thus ſpake.
                  What need it (Gentlemen) that I ſhould vſe any great perſwaſion for your bold fighting: conſidering you are the only authors of this war, and wherein you haue elected mee for your chiefe conducter? And that is the only reaſō mouing me to ſpeak, to the end, you may the more heedfully fixe before your eyes, the cauſe why you are aſſembled in ſo great a multitude. Reſolue your ſelus

that it is not to defend your Country your liberty, your wiues, children, nor your goods. But it is to conquer and ſubdue a nation, the moſt proud and arrogant people this day liuing; who make of vs (dwelling ſomewhat farre from them) ſo ſmall eſteeme, as of nothing leſſe. Neuertheleſſe, as neere as they are, I hardly thinke that they dare abide vs; for though they carry a kinde of fury in their marching: yet if you note well their lookes, there appeares an apparant teſtimony of doubt and difficulty in dealing with vs, which may moue & giue ye more heart to fight, then all the words of

We are heere, the very ſtoure & ful ſtrength of moſt part of the Ocean Iſlands, & in ſuch a gallant number, that it were (almoſt) a ſin to make any doubt of our certain victore. And for our further aſſurance, let vs remember, that wee are in a ſtrange Country, a large & long diſtance from our own, not among our louers and friends, but euen in the very midſt of our enemies, that euery houre expect our ruine & death. A matter which we cannot auoid, if we be once broken & diſſeuered. For they haue worthy horſe-men, by whom we are certain to be purſued, without any meanes o

Let each man therfore do his duty; and I make no doubt, but before darke night do check our forwardneſſe, we ſhall be Lords and Maiſters of the whole Country, and thereby be held dreadfull in other parts of the world.
                  King Aranigne hauing thus encouraged his Souldiers, hee cauſed them to march in good order toward their enemies: who likewiſe marched in maine battell on the hill top, making ſuch a glittering radiance with their Armes, that it was a moſt goodly ſight to behold. And they; were diuided into fiue ſquadrons; the firſt being guided by Brian de Moniaſte, with a thouſand knights of Spaine. The ſecond, by King Cildadan, with the like number of knights. The third by Galuanes. The fourth by Giontes: And the

                     nt and magnanimious Prince, he went from battation to battalion, to perſwade his Cheualiers, to fight brauely. And for their better encitation thereto be gaue them to vnderſtand that (with great ſhame) he was thus aſſayled by theſe enemies, without any quarrell at all againſt them; but onely through the perſwaſion and procurement of Archalaus, the moſt diſloyall traytour and villaine that euer liued, they were thus entred his Country, with an abſolute hope of conqueſt. And therfore my louing friends (quoth he) right being on our ſide, God (who is moſt iuſt, & in whoſe hand are all victories) wil vndoubtedly aſſiſt vs. If they ſay, that they war thus vpon vs, in reuenge of them that laſt inuaded this kingdō with K. Cildadan, aſſure your ſelues, they may well account to be therein deceiued. For in weening (vnder confidence of power) to reuenge their iniuries, their ſhame ſhall thereby be encreaſed, and a miſerable concluſion of their liues, voluntarily enforced, and ſought by themſelues. Full well you know, that we are no new learners, how to

be ſeene in ſuch conflicts as theſe: but old and well tryed Souldiers, ſo experimented and approoued by themſelues; and ſo (I hope) at this time they ſhall finde vs. Their imaginarie victory, is grounded onely on the huge multitude of men in their Campe, a baſe and raſcal breed of people, collected from many infamous places, the moſt part of thē without order, obedience or diſcipline. The very ſight of our well-directed approach, will ſtrike amazement in their ſoules; yea, before we ſhall haue leyſure to vaile our launces: and let vs but once enforce them to diſorder, wee haue as much as we can deſire. Marche we on then vndauntedly, and let vs make them know, that they are no meete companions for our company: Onely, that our ground will be faſtened in being their graues, and our hungerſtarued wolues ſatisfied with their carrion, as three or foure times already, ſuch as they, haue beene ouer-thrown in ſeueral battailes, by the vertue and magnanimity of you and your aunceſtors.
                  Such were the words of this gentle King to his knights, who perceiuing their enemies making towards them, marched in a well ordered part to meet them. King Perion, Amadis & Floreſtan, lay hard by, cloſely ambuſhed, with no intent to ſtir themſelues, till they ſaw how the fight would ſpeed on either ſide. Perceiuing Brian and his troupe to coutche their launces, they beheld them forthwith among their enemies; mony good knights layed along on the earth, and as many ſlain outright. But King Targadan, who led the firſt battallion of King Aranigne, was ſuddenly ſuccoured by Abſadan, with 1200. knights, by which meanes Brian was conſtrayned to giue backe againe. King Perion perceiuing it, ſaid to Amadis and Floreſtan. Me thinkes, it is now high time to ſhewe our ſelues; for neuer can we looke for fitter occaſion, ſeeing the enemy hath to much aduantage ouer King Liſuarts people. On then Sir (quoth they) in Gods name let vs go helpe them.
                  Thus ſpeaking; they gaue the ſpur to their horſes, & the firſt that King Perion met, was king Targadan, who before had not charged any knight, but downe hee went to the ground. But King Perion gaue him ſuch a welcome with his Launce, that it pierced his Shield & armor, and ſo paſſed on quite thorow his body, that hee fell downe dead to the ground. If this encounter proued ſo hard to him, no leſſe was that of Abſadan the Braue: for Amadis met him with ſuch might, that hee gaue his ſoule preſent paſſage out of his body. The enemies became ſo daunted hereat, that their hearts failed them, and Brian and his followers preſſed ſore vpon them. Floreſtan made his aime at King Cardueil, in whom conſiſted (well neere) all their hope, & met him at ſuch apt aduantage, that he caſt him quite out of his Saddle, and down he fell between his horſes feete. Now began a moſt dreadfull conflict between the two armies, becauſe they ſtroue with maineſt violence, which ſhould moſt offend the other: & they that had ſeen Amadis cut the way thorow the crouds, wold haue thought him no ſuch maner of man, as layſlothfully idle ſix months together; for he neuer ſtroke, but it either ſlew outright, or moſt cruelly wounded, notwithſtanding all their ſtout reſiſtances. For they of Great Brittaine fought for their liberty & ſafety: whereas K. Aranigne & his men, labored only to conquer anothers country, thereby to enrich thēſelues; thus each ſide contended

who ſhould doe beſt, in bearing thence the honour of the day. Amadis had his horſe ſlain vnder him; but hee was ſpeedily ſuccoured, by ſuch ayde as King Liſuart, King Perion and his followers ſent him: who did all perfourme ſuch incredible deedes of Armes in enery place as their enemies fell into confuſion; & King Aranigne was ſo ſore wounded, that, being paſt any hope of life; hee fled to his Shippes, and the greater part of his people after him likewiſe.
                  As the other ſide purſued them very valiantly, Brutaxat, one of the beſt knights in the whole Army of the ſeauen Kings, beholding this faint-hearted flight, and foule diſorder: thruſt in with his followers, & made ſtay of them that chaſed King Aranigne, beginning as bloody a fight againe, as formerly had bin. In which ſpace, they that moſt feared the fights ſucceſſe, got into their Ships, & many were ſo ſaued: but Amadis entring among them, aſſayled Brutaxat with ſuch a powerfull ſtroke, that down fel heon the earth. This, much augmented the terror of the enemy, ſo that, for their eaſie means of flight, they threw downe their weapons & armor in the field; ſome running to the Sea, others to the woods & rocks, euen as Fortune could beſt conduct them. And although King Liſuart & his knights, found worke enough againſt their foes in the beginning: yet euery ey took particular obſeruation of wonders done that day, by three knights, bearing Serpents in their armes, ſo that the King himſelf often ſpake aloud, ſaying: Either theſe are Amadiſſes, or three deuils in their likenes. Notwithſtanding, when he conſidered, what iniury he had done him, he then fell into a contrary perſwaſion.
                  Thus King Liſuart remained victorious, and encamped himſelf (for that day) in the ſame place where he conquered his enemies: and as he diſarmed himſelfe, he queſtioned, what was become of the knights of the Serpents? No other anſwere could then bee returned, but that they were ſeene gallopping towards the forreſt, with all the ſwifteſt ſpeed their horſes could make. On my faith (quoth the King) I am not a little diſpleaſed, that they would not remaine with me: for he that hath three ſuch knights in his company, m
                        •
                     y boldly boaſte of ſecure aſſiſtance. Sir (anſwered a Squier, that met them ryding to the Forreſt) all three of them ſpake to me, and gaue me charge to tell ye, that they were conſtrained to leaue your Army, & beſtow their trauails in far countries where they may chance to fall into his power, that means to ſhew them but little mercy: humbly entreating you to hold them excuſed, that they gaue you not due reuerence before their departing.
                  Vndoubtedly, theſe words prooued truer, then Amadis expected when he ſpake them: but the Squier, continuing on his meſlage, further ſaid. Sir, moreouer they deſire you, that if any part of bootie be fit for them: it may be giuen to thoſe Ladies, that defended their Caſtell ſo worthily for you, that ſo they may receiue ſome recompence for the iniuries done to them. Before God I ſweare, anſwered the King, their requeſt ſhal be accompliſhed. But fair Sir (quoth he to Galaor) doe not you imagine your brother Amadis to be one of the three? No ſurely Sir, ſaid Galaor, becauſe I receiued Letters (ſome few dayes ſince) from him, whereby he gaue me to vnderſtand, that neither he, nor Floreſtan would ſtirre out of Gaule, vntill they heard ſome newes from me.

I cannot chuſe then, replyed the King, but maruaile, of whence, and what they are. I know not, (quoth Galaor) but whatſoeuer they are, heauen ſhreld them from any il ſucceſſe; for (neuer in my life) did I looke on more braue and worthie Knights, or men that could doe more for you, then this day they haue done.
                  So ſpent they out the reſt of the day, in no other diſcourſe (almoſt) but onely concerning the knights of the Serpents. And raiſing their Campe on the morrow, they went to Gandale, where the Queene and Ladies awayted the Kings comming: there alſo hee brake vp his Atmy, diſcharging euery man to his owne home.
               
               
                  CHAP. VI.
                  
                     How the three Knights of the Serpents, returning homeward into Gaule, were (by contrary fortune) caſt on the place where Archalaus the Enchanter dwelt, who reſolued on their death, and what afterward befell them.
                  
                  
                     THree whole dayes together; King Perion & his two Sonnes kept thēſelues cloſely hidden in the Forreſt: as well for eaſe and refreſhing after ſo great toyle, as in expectation of a conuenient winde for ſhipping, which on the fourth day fortunatly happened; & ſo they ſet ſayle, with a purpoſed intent for returning home into Gaule. But it fell out farre otherwiſe with them; for hardly had they attained into the maine Sea, but it began to ſwel and riſe in ſuch dreadfull manner (being ſtirde and enraged with contrary windes) as if Heauen and earth had contended together, and the Ship was ſo hurried by impetuoſitie of the waues, that, notwithſtanding all the paines and endeauours of the Mariners, they were conſtrained and driuen backe againe, towardes the coaſt of Great Brittaine, & to land farre enough from the place where they tooke ſhipping. There the three knights went on ſhore, and mounting on their horſes; without any Squire to attend them; they would needs ſeek after ſome aduenture, vntill the Sea ſhould be better ſetled, hauing left expreſſe command with their men, not to depart thence, till their returne.
                  They had not ridden any great length of ground, but deſcending downe a Rocke to a goodly plaine, they 
                        •…
                     et with a Lady, attended by thre
                        •
                      Squires, and two Damoſels, each carrying a Falcon on their fiſt, as if they intended an hourely flight. The Lady beholding them, made way with her Palfray towards them, deliuering moſt
                        •
                      gracious geſture for their happy meeting: and vſing ceremony of kinde ſalutation, gaue them to vnderſtand by apparant ſignes, that ſhe was bereft of ſpeech, and dumbe. Moſt louely and faire ſhe appeared to the knights, which moued them to compaſſionat greatly her hard fortune; and ſhe going to him that had the golden Helmet; making ſignes of embraces, and offers to kiſſe his hand, gaue outward notice both to him and the reſt, of requeſt to haue them accept alodging in her caſtel, which was at hand. And leſt the knights ſhould miſtake her meaning: ſhe made the like ſigns to her Squires, who fully acquainted

them with her deſire, entreeting them (at their Ladies motion) to accept of one nights entertainment in her Caſtell.
                  The knights being ſomewhat crazie, and wearied with the rough tempeſt endured on the Sea, imagined that her will accorded with their words, and that no treaſon lay hid vnder this honeſt out-ſide; yeelded to hers and their requeſt, riding ſoftly on with her, and entring into a pleaſant ſeated Caſtel, where they were moſt graciouſly entertained, and conducted to a very goodly Chamber, and there they vnarmed themſelues. When they were ſet downe at the Table for Supper, diuers Damoſels came, each of them hauing an inſtrument, and began to play moſt melodiouſly: paſſing the time away in theſe pleaſing recreations, vntill the houre for reſt drew neere. Then withdrew the Muſicians, and the thred knights, being left all alone, layed 
                        •
                     hrm downe in one bedde together; where (ſoone after) they fell aſleepe, as men that had ſome neede of repoſe.
                  Heere yee are to obſerue, that the Bed wherein the knights lay, was fixed vpon a vice or ſcrew, to bee let downe and mounted againe (without any noyſe at all) into a dungeon of twenty fathome deepe: and there the knights found themſelues in the morning at their awaking, & whereat they were not a little amazed, perceiuing themſelues to bee betrayed, for they could not diſcerne any light at all; nor deuiſe how they ſhould bee tranſported thither. At length, they aroſe to finde either ſome window for aire, or doore for paſſage to get forth, but all was in vaine, no likelyhood appeared anywhere of opening, or that might yeeld them the ſmalleſt comfort. But continuing on, in this doubtfull maze, they could heare the ſteppes and treadings of people ouer their heads, and about ſeauen or eight houres after, they ſaw a window opened vp aloft, and a knight (but meanely aged) putting thorow his head, demaunding (very vnmanerly) what new-come gueſts came ſo willingly to looke for good entertainment there? By my faith, luſtie Roiſters (quoth hee) ſince I haue gotten hold of yee, I ſhall bee ſoundly reuenged of the wrongs ye haue done me; but that your liues is not any part of ſufficient payment. I am not now to 
                        •…
                     arn, that you are they, which cauſed the ouerthrow of Aranigne and his Army, maintaining the quarrell of that wicked Liſuart: and let me now tell ye, that you are in the power of Archalaus, who will ſoone enough make knowne what loue hee beares yee. Looke well vpon mee, and if you neuer ſaw mee before this inſtant: take good notice of me now, to know me againe, if you can ſcape from me. Oh how glad a man ſhould I bee, if that villaine Amadis de Gaule were one among yee? By my ſoule, I would not ſleepe, till I had cut off both his noſe and hands, and put him to the moſt cruel death that euer was deuiſed.
                  Preſently came the Lady, who (the day before) counterfeited her ſelfe to be dumbe, and ſaid. Vncle, yonder youngeſt man (pointing to Amadis) is the knight that wore the golden Helmet, who (you ſaid) had ſo brauely behaued himſelfe in Armes. This Lady we now ſpeake of, was the daughter to Ardan Canile, naming her ſelfe D
                           •…
                        raa, the moſt malicious and ſubtile woman that thoſe times affoorded; and had not come into theſe parts, but only to take Amadis, and procure his

death, which was the principall reaſon why ſhe diſſembled her ſelfe to be dumbe. No ſooner had ſhe vttered theſe words, but Archalaus went frem the window, and ſhutting it againe in moſt churliſh manner, ſaid to the knights. Be as merry as yee may; for before night, I wil haue your heads cut off; and then Ile ſend them to king Aranigne, in ſatisfaction of the iniuries hee receiued by your meanes.
                  Much more amazed now, then euer, was King Perion and his ſonnes, to ſee themſelues thus in the power of Archalaus; and perceiuing ſo palpably, that (vnder the counterfaited ſhew of dumbnes) the Lady 
                        •…
                     hom they meant al good to) had thus deceiued them. But that which redoubled the ſorrowes of Amadis and Floreſtan, was, to behold their aged Father in ſuch danger, now vpon the very ending of his dayes; this mooued them to ſuch compaſſion, as they could not refrain from weeping. Neuertheleſſe, hee being a wiſe and vertuous Prince, beganne not onely to be of courage, but alſo to comfort them, in this manner. How now my Sonnes? are yee ſo ſoone daunted at the diſſemblings of Fortune? are yee now to learne her mutabilities (vpon my faith) I did euer hold ye to be more ſtrong and conſtant. Let mee entreate one fauour from yee, to lay no more affliction on me, then I am poſſeſſed of already. For, your extremity of ſadneſſe doth ſo ouer weigh my ſoule, as that is ſufficient onely to be my death. Therefore, reſume your wonted courage, and let vs put our truſt in God: he is almighty, and able to free vs from this place, committing all care to him, and reſting perſwaded of his prouidence.
                  But who could euer haue imagined, that, eſcaping the dangers in ſo bloody a Battaile: we ſhould fall into ſuch an accident, by the perſuaſions onely of a ſilly woman, and vnder the couller of ſuch a dumbe deuice? Therefore, louing Sonnes, ſeeing we are not in caſe to diſpoſe of our ſelues; ſetting apart all naturall pitty and compaſſion, which either you can haue of me, or I of you: let vs be patient, and not miſlike our fortune, which we are not able any way to mend. Amadis and Floreſtan, hearing their Father ſpeake with ſuch a chearefull and conſtant reſolution; it appeared to them, that they were disburdened of the heauieſt load of their diſaſter; and therfore concluded, to reioyce in all tribulations whatſoeuer ſhould happen vnto them. And ſo they ſpent all the reſt of the day, without receiuing either meat or drinke, till ſomewhat late in the euening: at which time Archalaus came to them againe, and opened the window, accompanied with Danarda, and two auncient knights, bearing in their hands faire lighted Torches, and calling to his priſoners, he ſaid:
                  Knights, you that ſleep ſo ſoundly at eaſe, is not your appetite yet ſtirring, to eate ſome good meate, if you could come by it? Sir, anſwered Floreſtan, if you were pleaſed to giue vs any. By my ſoule, replyed Archalaus, I haue no will to giue yee any, but rather to take meate from ye, if ye had it. Notwithſtanding, becauſe ye ſhall not bee altogether diſcomforted, to delight ye a little, I haue ſome good tidings to tell yee, whereof (perhaps) you will be ioyfull. This euening, two Squires and a dwarfe came hither, making enquiry after certaine knights, bearing Armes of Serpents: them haue I alſo taken into my cuſtody, and allowed them as faire a lodging as

yours is; but if they tell me not to morrow morning, of whence and what you are, you cannot imagine a death more cruell, then that I will put them to. Heerein, Archalaus did not diſſemble with them; for they in the Shippe, perceiuing that not any of them returned againe, ſent forth Gandalin, the Dwarfe, and Orpheus, the Arras-weauer, to vnderſtand what was become of them, arriuing (by chance) at the ſame Caſtell, where their Lords and Maiſters were impriſoned.
                  The three knights hearing theſe newes, were greatly diſcontented, and not without eſpeciall cauſe: for they ſtood in doubt, leſt torment, or ſome other meanes, ſhould cauſe them diſcloſe, whatthey would haue concealed. Yet Amadis, making no outward ſhew thereof, returned this anſwere to Archalaus. Truſt me, Sir, when you ſhall know of whence, and what we are, I am well aſſured, that you will allow vs better wel-come, then hitherto you haue done: For your ſelfe being a knight, as wee are, and (perhaps) heretofore, falne into the trecheries of Fortune, as now we are; would finde the fauour of a friend, as we could affoord the like to you, ſtood you in the like neceſſity as we do. And if any mater of manhood be in vs, me thinks, that might well inſtruct yee (aboue all things elſe) to offer vs no wrong. How now Sir (anſwered Archalaus) haue yee learnde to prate ſo boldly? you ſhall finde, who it is that holdes diſpute with ye, and whether I offer ye wrong or right. And let this bee your comfort, that like fauous as I would vſe to Amadis de Gaule, were he in my power, the very ſame, and no other will I extend to you.
                  Vncle ſaid Dinarda, if you meane to ſend their heades to King Aranigne, doe it not, vntill ſeuerity of famine haue cauſed their death: for, ſuffering them to liue ſomewhile in miſery, death will then appeare the more welcome to them. Beleeue me Niece (quoth he) it is well aduiſed, and I am content to allow there-of: whereupon, hee ſaid vnto them, that they ſhould haue ſome ſmall mater of feding; prouided, they muſt reſolue him, whether hunger or thirſt moſt offend them; anſwere therefore (on your faith) which is the moſt irk eſome to yee? Seeing, (ſaid King Perion) you coniure vs ſo powerfully; I could like well to haue meate, but thirſt doth afflict vs in much extreamer manner. So, (quoth Archalaus) I haue a piece of fat Lard, which hath lien in powder aboue theſe three moneths; that (I am ſure) will quenche your thirſt. Preſently it was brought, and hee hurling it in at the grate, ſaid. There, take it friends, make good cheare with it, and ſay not now, but you are kindly entertained. So they departed, leauing a Damoſell at the window, to liſten what ſpeeches ſhould paſſe betweene them. Much talke had ſhe heard concerning the feature of perſon and manly proweſſe, of him that wore the golden Helmet; eſpecially, that in the late battell againſt King Aranigne, hee had declared ſuch deeds of Armes, as no knight elſe could performe the like. This raiſed (in her) great pitty and compaſſion, and for his ſake, ſhe prouided a Flagon of wine and water, which letting down ſoftly to them, ſhe ſaid. Gentlemen, be ſecret in this fauour I ſend ye, and (as I may) I will defend ye from periſhing. The knights returned her moſt hartie thankes: ſo ſhutting faſt the window, ſhe bade them go to ſuch reſt, as that foule place would aſſoord them.
                  Now, concerning the entertainment

of Gandalin, and the two other, that ſought after King Perion and his company, being falne into the hands of Archalaus, as hath bin ſaid already: be it knowne to yee, that they were ſuddenly ſhut vp in a darke vault, ouer the Chamber where the ſuppoſed dumbe Lady had formerly lodged their Maſters. There they found two knights and a Damoſell, wife to the elder of the knights, who had long time beene kept there as priſoners: who declared to the Squires, that by the window of their priſon, they ſaw three knights (bearing Armes of Serpents) brought in thither, and very worthy welcome giuen them at the firſt. Neuertheleſſe (quoth one of them) at length they were let down into a deepe Dungeon, by the moſt horrid treaſon that euer was heard of: for the Bedde wherein they lay, was fixed on a ſcrew or giuing viſe; which eaſily, and without the leaſt noyſe, conueyed them aboue twenty fathome in depth, they being in a ſound ſleepe, dreading no harme at all.
                  Full well knew Gandalin and the other, that theſe knights were their Maiſters, thus betrayed: notwithſtanding, they made no outward apparance thereof; but (as if they had neuer ſeene or knowne them) Gandalin thus anſwered. For ought I can perceiue, moſt vnhappily came we hither, where ſuch worthy men are ſo cruelly handled, of whom we haue heard much fame and faire report. But is there no way or means whereby to ſuccourand helpe them? I am vndoubtedly perſwaded, that if they were deliuered, our abiding heere would not be long. Let mee tel ye (anſwered the ancient knight) the maine butte or end of the vice, which ſupporteth the bed wherein they lye, is vnder the plancher of this Chamber, and heere you may behold it. If all our ſtrength & labor will ſerue to turne it about, and remount the bed vp againe to his former place: they may eaſily get forth, becauſe the doore is neuer ſhut; and moreouer, the Guardes or Keepers of the Caſtell, are now all in their deadeſt ſleepe. Let vs try (quoth Gandalin) what we can do; ſo euery one ſet to their hand.
                  Such was their painfull labour & endeauour, that the ſcrew of the vice turning by little and little, the bed beganne to riſe: and King Perion (being then not able to ſleepe) felt how it mooued: wherefore, awaking Amadis and Floreſtan, hee ſaid vnto them - Doe not you feele that we are remounting vp aloft? Aſſure your ſelues, the villaine Archalaus will keepe promiſe with vs, for (doubtleſſe) wee are diſcouered to him.
                  I know not (ſaid Amadis) what may be his meaning: but hee that firſt layes hold on me to do me out-rage, ſhall pay the reckoning for all the reſt. While thus they conferred; by little and little the bedde drew vp neere to the plancher, and attained to fixing in his firſt place. Then our knights, leaping lightly on their feete, drew forth their Swords, looking all about them, to ſee who had thus raiſed them again. But they could not ſee any body, to their no little maruaile, and they found their Armes in the ſame place where they had lefte them, before they went to reſt, wherewith they armed themſelues immediatly. Afterward, they iſſued forth ſo ſecretly, that ſeazing the Guards, they hewed and ſliced them in pieces, before any ey could take notice thereof, vntill ſuch time, as, by the great noiſe they made, in breaking the bolts and barres of the gates,

and ſharpe aſſayling ſuch as they met withall: Archalaus awaked, and heard Amadis cry with a loude voyce. For Gaule, for Gaule, this Caſtell is ours.
                  In great affrightment he roſe, and hauing no leyſure to arme himſelfe, he ran into a ſtrong Tower, mounting to the top thereof, and drawing vp the Ladder after him; where ſeeing himſelfe in ſafety, putting his head out ata window, he called to his people ſo loud as he could. In the meane while, our three knights had made way to Gandalin and the reſt, freeing them from the ſlauery of Archalaus: whom they eſpied bawling aloft on the Tower, with ſome other, for their better ſafety. And becauſe they could by no poſſible meanes come at them, they made a great fire, and ſmoakt them in ſuch ſort, as they were glad to deſcend into-he loweſt vaults, where they were likewiſe almoſt ſmothred with ſmoke.
                  At length, the knights, ſeeing the Caſtell all engirt with fire; commanded their horſes to bee led forth; where mounting on them, they cō
                     mended Archalaus to all his deuils; and the Dwarfe cryed out, Archalaus, Archalaus, remember how kindly thou didſt vſe me, when thou tiedſt me faſt by the feete; in the Caſtel of Valderin, where I was as well perfum'd, as thou art now. The dwarfe deliuered theſe words ſo angerly, & with ſuch a ſtrange geſture, as made them all to laugh hartily. And when they were ſomewhat further off, they looked behind them, and beheld the Caſtell flaming gallantly: perſwading themſelues, that they were ſufficiently reuenged on Archalaus, and that he could no way eſcape with life.
                  By this time, bright day appeared, and they arriued at the place where they left their Ship; & there, the Gentlewoman that had bin deliuered with the reſt, remembring the words of Amadis in the Caſtell, when he cryed, For Gaule, for Gaule: deſired to know of Gandalin, which of them was the man. Gandalin pointing her to Amadis; ſhee went and fell at his feete, deſiring pardon of him. For (quoth ſhee) I am Darioletta, that committed your life to the mercy of the Sea, euen the very ſame day that you were borne. But beleeue me, my Lord, I did it to ſaue the honour of the Qaeen your Mother, who otherwiſe had bin put to death: for no one did know, but my ſelfe onely, that the King your Father (who is heere preſent with yee) was as then married to her. Amadis; was much amazed heereat, for he had neuer heard the cauſe, wherefore he was left in ſuch ſorſaken manner: ſo, taking Darioletta by the hand, he ſaid vnto her. Faire Friend, I pardon ye, perceiuing it was done vpon ſo iuſt an occaſion: and (heretofore) Galuanes hath often told me, that he found me floating on the Sea; but, till this inſtant, I was vtterly ignorant, how it came to paſſe. Then ſhe related all from point to point (without omitting any thing) euen from the beginning of King Perions loue, to his Queene Eliſena, and the ſucceſſe of euery accident: wherein the king tooke no little delight, and often entreated Darioletta to repeat the ſweet pleaſures of his youth.
                  But while this company were thus in quiet and contentment, the caſe of Archaiaus carried no correſpondencie therewith: for hee and hir, remained inthe deep vault vnder his ſower, where he was as well fauouredly ſmoakt and perfumed, as euer Rainard the Foxe was in his vnderground kennel. And if his Niece

                     Dinarda, and ſome others had not ſuccoured him; hee had there miſerably ended his dayes. But they came to him ſo ſoone as the knights were gone, finding him ſo ſuffocated and ouercome, as he was not able to ſtirre either hand or foote. Taking him forth of that ſmothering vault, they threw vineger and cold water in his face, ſo that (ſoon after) he began to breathe, and opening his eyes, beheld his Caſtell all on a ſ

As they rode on the way, at the entrance of a neere neighbouring Forreſt; they eſpied two knights, refreſhing themſelues by the brim of a goodly Spring or Fountaine; who ſeeing the Litter attended by fiue knights, and two Damoſels: they imagined, that ſome wounded body was therin; where upon, they made toward it to be reſolued: which, when Archalaus perceiued, he ſaid. Go, bid yonder high-way ſpies come to me, and if they make any deniall, hew them in pieces: but be carefull, that you doe not tel them who I am, leſt they flye away with feare.
                  Heere you muſt note, that theſe two thus ſent for by Archalaus, were Galaor, and his companion Norandel; to whō 
                     
                        •
                     hen the other knights came, fiercely they commaunded them to lay downe their Armes, and come ſpeake with him that was in the Litter. What ſaucie Sir is hee, ſaid Galaor, that would haue vs diſarme our ſelues, and then come to him? You ſhall know no more then you doe, replyed one of the other knights: but if yee vſe any longer conteſting, we wil make ye come to him with cudgelling. I would laugh at tha (tſaid Norandel) I am ſure you meane not as you ſay. That ſhal appeare (quoth they) and ſo ranne againſt them: but Galaor and Norandel vnhorſed the firſt two they met withall, albeit they all fiue gaue the encounter together, and yet could not ſtirre them in their ſaddles. The fight grew fell and fierce betweene them; but the knights belonging to Archalaus, were not able to endure the blowes of the other two, who tooke ſuch order with them, that three of them were ſlaine out tight, and the other fled into the wood to ſaue themſelues, whom they reſuſed to follow, leſt he in the Litter ſhould get away from them in the meane while.
                  To the Litter they came, & found Archalaus left all alone: becauſe they that kept him company, had quite forſaken him, vpon the ſoile & flight of the ſiue knights; only there was a Boy remaining, who guided the horſes of the Litter. Archalaus was not a little amazed, to ſee him-ſelfe in the power of ſtrangers, who might well be reuenged on him, for the outrage done them: neuertheleſſe, be thinking himſelfe on a ſudden ſubtile ſhift, he ſaluted them in very humble manner. But they (being iuſtly moued with choller) comming neere, and offering to ſtrike

him, ſaid. Treacherous thiefe, is this thy maner of behauiour to knights errant, ſeeking their death, that neuer offended thee
                        •
                     ? I ſweare by heauen. this is the laſt outrage thou ſhalt doe to any man liuing. Galaor hauing ſpoken theſe words, lifted vp his arme to ſmite him: but Archalaus (in great feare) cryed out. Alas my Lords, for Gods ſake mercy. Mercy (quoth Galaor) If Grumedan iudge thee worthy of mercy, thou mayeſt perhaps haue it, otherwiſe not: for to him ſhalt thou goe, and by him ſhall thy vill any be ſentenced. Worthy Lords, anſwered Archalaus, you cannot doe me a greater pleaſure, then bring mee to my Couſin Grumedan, who knowes me to bee another manner of man, then you imagine me. It is not vnknowne to him, that (at all times) I haue laboured, ſerued and honored Knights errant, ſuch as I now perceiue you are.
                  When Galaor and Norandel heard him ſpeake ſo honeſtly, and named Grumedan to be his kinſeman, they were halfe offended with themſelus, that they had giuen him ſuch rough language, and anſwered him thus. What moued you then to ſend vs ſuch an iniurious command by your men? In good faith my Lords quoth he, if you pleaſe but to heare me, I will acquaint you with the whole truth.
                  Know then, that as I (not long ſince) croſſing the For eſt of the Black Lake, I met with a Damoſell, who made complaint vnto me of a great wrong done her by a knight, which my duty and order binding me to repair
                        •
                     e I purſued him according to her direction, and entring the Combate with him, before the Count of Ganceſte, ſoyled him. But it chanced afterward, as I returned hometo my Caſtell, that villaine Traytour, which firſt of all you ſlew, accōpanied with two other knights, who lay cloſely ambuſhed to entrap me; watching their fitteſt oportunity, did all ſet vpon me, and would forcibly compell me, to make them Lords and Commanders of mine owne dwelling. What ſhall I more ſay to ye. They followed mee with ſuch violence, as notwithſtanding, all I could doe in my beſt defence: they tooke me, and ſed me priſoner to a Fortreſſe not farre hence, where they long time detayned mee, in the moſt iniurious manner could be deuiſed, not permitting ſo much as the dreſſing of ſuch wounds, as I had receiued in fight againſt them, and are heere apparant to your view.
                  With theſe words, hee ſhewed them diuers skarres and hurts. And becauſe (quoth he) they ſtood in feare, leſt I ſhould eſcape frō them, and go to the Court of good King Liſuart, there to require ayde and inſtice, of the gentle knight Amadis de Gaule, or of his noble Brother Galaor, by the ſuitherance of my Couſin Don Grumedan: this very day, they had me along with them in this Litter (becauſe I was not able to endure trauaile on horſe-back) purpoſing to carry me, God knowes whether: doubting the friendſhip and helpe of my honourable kinſmen, that laboured to releaſe mee out of their thraldome ſome few dayes ſince. In which reſpect, they no ſooner eſpied you, but thinking you to lye in waite for the ſame occaſion, they made no conſcience in abuſing you, as they had done mee in moſt rigorous maner.
                  Worthy Sir (replied Galaor) on the faith of a knight, by this diſcours of yours, they were truely villaines. For, you being kinſman to one of

the beſt-deſeruing men in the world, your wrongs haue bin too great and vnſufferable. But let me entreat you, to tell vs your name, and to pardon the iniurie wee haue likewiſe done ye, being ignorant of whence and what you were. I am named (quoth Archalaus) Branfiles, and know not whether you haue heard of me heere to fore or no. Yes that I haue, and vnderſtand your merit among the very beſt (anſwered Galaor) in doing all honorable courteſies to knights errant, at what time ſoeuer you can compaſſe the meanes, as Don Grumedan himſelfe hath many times told me. I am glad of it (quoth Archalaus,) and ſeeing you haue receiued knowledge of me, let me in kindneſſe obtaine ſo much fauour at your hands, as to take off your Helmets, and to tell me your names, that I may returne thankes to my Couſin Grumedan, for your extraordinary curteſie.
                  This knight (ſaide Galaor) my deare friend and companion, is called Norandel, and he is Sonne to King Liſuart. And I am Galaor, brother to Amadis de Gaule. Happy man that I am (anſwered Archalaus (diſſemblingly lifting vp his eyes to heauen) could any greater felicity befall me, then to bee thus relieued with two of the beſt knights in the world. This conference he continued the longer, taking good note and obſeruation of them, that if euer they ſhould happen into his hands, he might be the better reuenged on them. And my good Lords (quoth he) command me what ſeruice ſhall like you beſt, for I confeſſe my life to be onely yours: aſſuring ye on my faith, that if you at any time come where I may entertaine ye, you ſhall effectually finde what loue I beare ye. Friend Branfiles, anſwered Galaor, good ſucceſſe attend ye: but if you pleaſe, we will ride along with ye, for your better ſecurity. I hartily thanke ye, replyed Archalaus, but this day I ſhall neede no further defence, I am ſo neere to a Caſtell, where I am aſſured of kind welcome.
                  So he departed from them, not a little glad, that he was ſo well rid of them; for if they had knowen him, he had not eaſily eſcaped from them: wherefore, he commaunded him that guided the Litter, to make all the haſte he poſſibly might, and to take the moſt vnfrequēted waies, leſt they ſhould purſue and recouer him again. By this time it waxed ſo late, that the Moon ſhone brightly: wherefore Galaor (ſeeing no other helpe) concluded on their byding that night by the Fountain, whereto Norandel was as willing as he. As they diſarmed themſelues, one of their Squires told them, that they ſhould haue better cheare then they expected. How ſhall we haue it? quoth Galaor. It is ready enough for ye (anſwered the Squire: for, while you were fighting with the 5. knights they that remained with Branfiles, forſook him alſo, and left a horſe loden with victuals, whereof I took the charge, while the 2 damoſels, which accōpanied the litter, entred among yonder old ruines of houſes, from whence (as yet) they are not gone, becauſe I haue obſerued them warily. So much the better, anſwered Norandel, conduct me where they are, that they may haue part in this booty
                  
                     Galaor went with him and the Squire, who ſhewed the place where they had hid themſelues, which was an old Caue: in regard whereof, the Damoſels had falne ſo deepely into it, as they could not by any meanes get out againe. Now, becauſe the Squire knew not certainly, whether any knights were

in their company or no, the entrance of the Caue being ſo vnaccuſtomed, and neither Galaor or Norandel had their Armes about them: hee would proceede no further, but with a loud voyce called vnto them, ſaying. Come foorth Ladies, come foorth, and giue mee not occaſion to fetch ye foorth, leſt perhaps you repent it. Twiſe or thriſe he thus called to them, and they appeared not to heare him: when Norandel growing offended thereat, aduiſed Galaor, that fire ſhould be made at the caues mouth, and ſo to ſmoake them forth, whether they would or no.
                  
                     Dinarda hearing theſe wordes, waxed very fearefull, and cryed out aloud, ſaying. Alas Gentlemen, take pitty vpon vs, and we will preſently come forth vnto ye. Diſpatch then ſaid Galaor, and come away quickly, for we may not attend your leyſure. Beleeue it Gentle-men (quoth ſhee) vnfaynedly, that wee are not able to come vnto yee, without your helpe, we are falne ſo deepe vnder the ground, and further (perhaps) then you will beleeue. Heereupon, Norandel went in him-ſelfe, and holpe them out each after other; when, perceiuing them to be ſuch beautifull creatures: I know not which of them was the forwardeſt, to entertaine a faire friend, ſo that Galaor pleaded poſſeſſion of Dinarda; and Norandel of the other. Then ſending the Squire to prepare their Supper, meane while, they wandred ſomewhat further into the wood; where you may well conceiue, that hauing a place ſo conuenient, and being furniſhed with ſuch prouiſion, as ſuch yong yeares and wanton deſires could wiſh for: neither of the knights was ſo dull ſpirited, but knew well enough how to entertain his amorous Miſtreſſe.
                  Which dalliances being ended, the knights conducted them to the Fountaine, where they friendly ſupt together, with ſuch food as the men of Archalaus had left behind them; vſing ſuch conference all the time of Supper, as doubtleſſe was not any way diſpleaſing. By meanes whereof, the Damoſels, who (at the firſt encountring) ſeemed ſtrange, and halfe angry, were now become ſo gentle, milde, and tractable; that Supper was no ſooner ended, but they went into the wood againe with the knights, as familiar in their kiſſes, and kinde embraces, as formerly they had beene to Galaor and Norandel. In which pleaſures they continued til the break of day, when Norandels Lady thus ſpake vnto him. In good ſadneſſe Sir, I feare leſt Madame Dinarda will be offended with me, becauſe I haue abſented my ſelfe ſo long time from her. Neuer thinke you ſo (quoth he) for ſhe needes none of your preſence, being ſo well accompanied as ſhee is: And I dare make it good, that ſhe is as willing to be alone, as you are, or can be. But reſolue me in one thing I pray ye; is not this Dinarda, the daughter to Ardan Canile, who (not long ſince) came into this Country, to aske the counſel of Archalaus, how ſhe might be reuenged on Amadis de Gaule, and compaſſe his death? I am not acquainted (ſaid ſhe) with the cauſe of her comming hither; but well I wot, ſhee is the daughter to Ardan Canile, and in my poore opinion, he that hath beene pleaſed with her company this night paſt, may well boaſt of his happines & good fortune: for he hath wonne that, which many great perſōs could neuer gaine ſo much as a ſight of.
                  Heere let me tell ye, as heereto-fore I haue done, that this Dinarda was both cunning and malicious,

expreſſing to Galaor ſuch an outward ſhew of loue and intire affection, as if her ſoule and behauiour truely conſented together. And ſo farre was his beliefe abuſed by her, that, notwithſtanding his aduertiſing by Norandel, what ſpeech had paſt betweene him and his nightcommodity, yet hee made no account at all thereof, but declared as faire friendſhip to her, as before, not wanting in his very beſt curteſies to her. But at length, he demaunded of her, if ſhe knew the knight that was carried in the Litter? Full well (quoth ſhe,) and did not you know him to be Archalaus the Enchanter? Archalaus? (anſwered Galaor.) Had I but knowne ſo much before, hee ſhould haue felt the keene edge of my Sword. Is he not dead? (replyed Dinarda.) No (quoth Galaor,) my ignorance (for this once) hath priuiledged his life: but if euer hereafter we chaunce to meet againe, he ſhall well finde, that a debt delayed, is not payed, another day will ſerue the turne.
                  Right glad was Dinarda, to heare that her Vncle had eſcaped with life: notwithſtanding, wiſely ſhee diſſembled her contentment, and returned this anſwere. Truſt me, Sir, it is no long while ſince I hazarded my life for the ſafety of his: but now finding my ſelfe ſo farre interreſted in your faire affection, aſſure your ſelfe, it is one of my greateſt grieuances, that you did not kill him; for there is not a heauier enemy in the world, to the life of you and your brother Amadis. I know it too well, (replied Galaor) and ſo long a forbearance, ſhould now haue found a full diſcharge for all his trecheries, but that his ſubtilty outwent my honeſt ſimplicity, which will be quickly footed when time ſhal ſerue.
                  Broad day breaking off theſe priuate conferences, they mounted on horſebacke with the Damoſels: who tooke no great pleaſure in their company, though they bare it out with notable diſſembling! But that which moſt offended Dinarda, was the report of Galaor, that he had left the Court of King Liſuart, onely to finde his Brother Amadis de Gaule, whom ſhe hated more then any man liuing. So long they iourneyed together, that on the third day following, they came to a Fortreſſe, the gates whereof ſtood wide open. In they rode, not meeting with any body whom they might ſpeake to: but ſoone after came the Lord of the place, named Ambades, attended with ſome of his ſeruants, on whom (beholding this new come company) he looked angerly, becauſe they had not drawen the Bridge before their arriuall. Neuertheleſſe, conſidering, that now it could not bee holpen, he made a ſhew of courteous entertainment, & much againſt his minde. For he was neere kinſ-man to Archalaus, and euery way as wicked as he, quickly taking knowledge of his Niece Dinarda: by whō hee vnderſtood the fortunes of his Couſin; and Dinarda alſo perſwaded him, that ſhe and the other Damoſell had bin violently deflowred by Galaor and Norandel.
                  
                  Hereat he grew ſo incenſed with fury, that inſtantly he would haue aſſayled them: but Dinarda willed him to be better aduiſed, becauſe they two onely had foyled fiue knights, that had the conduct of her Vncle, and might prooue as powerfull ouer him and his. Therefore Sir, quoth ſhe, as yet it is heſt to conceale your diſcontentment, till their departing hence to morrow morning, when I and this Damoſell will guide thē forth: then letting down the Port-cullies of the gate, we ſhall

be ſure to tarry with yee in the ſecurer ſafety.
                  
                     Ambades did not miſlike this counſell, but went to Supper with the Knights and Ladies, betaking themſelues (afterward) to reſt in their appointed lodgings; and the next morning, being riſen, their hoſte came to them, ſaying. Gentle-men, when it ſhall pleaſe you to depart, I will bee your guide, thus armed as I am: for ſo am I vſed to doe, with any that accept of entertertainment heere; and before my returne backe againe, I take delight in the ſearch of aduentures, according as other knights errant do. My kinde Hoſte (anſwered Galaor) wee heartily thanke yee for your great curteſie. So, their horſes being brought, firſt they holpe to mounte the Damoſels, and themſelues: but they gaue way to Galaor and Norandel to ride out foremoſt, the women comming ſlowly after with Ambades. No ſooner were the knights beyond the gate, but downe fell the Port-cullies, and he (with the Damoſels) were now out of their power.
                  Forthwith, they mounted on the wall ouer the gate, and ſeeing the knights looke backe for the Damoſels comming after, he cryed out to them. Villaines, hell be your confuſion, before you get them againe in your poſſeſſion. Goe dwell among all the deuils, and let them vſe you, as ye haue done theſe poore Ladies; who dare venter no further with ſuch baſe-minded men, but chuſe rather willingly to abide here with me. Is it poſſible mine hoſte (anſwered Galaor) that after ſuch honour, and honeſt entertainment, affoorded by your ſelfe to vs in your Caſtell; you ſhould expreſſe ſuch lacke of manhood, as to robbe vs of our faire friends, ſo treacherouſly? If euer they were yours, (replied Ambades, or gaue themſelues to ye without conſtraint: it likes mee the better thus to take them from yee, as thinking it may the more vexe and moleſt yee. But I am aſſured, that luſtfully, and meerely againſt their mindes, you haue purſued and enioyed them; and therefore, at their earneſt requeſt made to me, I vſe ye as I doe; ſhame then to quarrell any further in this maner, conſidering how much they deteſt ye. Let them but ſay ſo much themſelus (quoth Galaor) to vs, and we ſhall quickly get vs gone.
                  
                     Dinarda, who (all this while) had hid her ſelfe, began to appeare vpon the wall, whereupon, Galaor ſpake thus vnto her.
                  Faire Miſtreſſe, this Knight wold gladly make vs beleeue, that willingly you remaine with him, and that our company is offenſiue to ye: We can hardly credit any trueth in his ſpeeches, remembring ſome occaſions that haue paſt betweene vs.
                  Then I perceiue (anſwered Dinarda) that fooliſh credulity betrayed your beſt iudgement in me; for my affectiō was neuer ſo earneſt towards ye, but I had rather behold your head parted from your ſhoulders, then to enioy one minute of your company.
                  Fond, and ydle-headed knight, didſt not thou know that I am Daughter to Ardan Canile, and that thy Brother Amadis is the man, whom (aboue all other) I haue moſt cauſe to deteſt and hate?
                  How then couldſt thou dreame, that any good inclination remained in me towardes thee: conſidering, that thy greateſt fauour to mee, ſince our late begun familiarity, hath aimed at no other end, but for

conueying me to Gaule, there to behold him whom I leaſt deſire to ſee? You may therefore depart hence at your pleaſure, and forget not to aſſure your ſelfe, that in being perſwaded I moſt faithfully affected you, you doe, and ſhall find me the moſt deadlieſt enemy you haue.
                  If I had giuen ye any ſuch occaſion, (anſwered Galaor) yet I am well aſſured, the ſweete ſatisfaction you receiued ſo latel / from me, and to you no meane contentment (as I imagined) did well deſerue more louely language. But I can eaſily aime at your intention; you would gladly borrow as much friendſhip of another man, as fearing that I was not able to pleaſure ye any further: wherein truely, now vpon better conſideration with my ſelfe, you haue reaſon ſo to doe, and I none at all to miſlike it.
                  For, ouer and beſide that generall diſeaſe, incident to all women of your witty diſpoſition, to affect change and nouelty: I ought to haue remembred how difficult a thing it is, from ſo badde a ſtocke as is worth iuſt nothing, that any good fruit can bee expected. For thou art Niece to the onely vyle wretch in the world, and thou muſt needs reſemble him in all kind of villainy.
                  But Madame, ſaid Norandel, I hope my amorous Miſtreſie, hath no ſuch cauſe to complaine of me: for neuer woman was better entertayned by her friend, then (for ſo long time together) ſhee was by mee, and that I dare referre to her owne report.
                  As he ſpake theſe wordes, he eſpied her peeping ouer the others ſhoulder; whereupon hee called to her, ſaying. How ſay you ſweet heart, is it not true? It is ſo true (quoth ſhee) that if I could compaſſe the like power ouer thee, as (when time was) thou hadſt ouer me; I ſhould eaſily make knowne, with what affection I endured whatſoeuer thou didſt to me, which pleaſed me ſo well, that I referre thee to the deuils recompence.
                  The deuill (ſaid Norandel) cares not for my company, hee likes yours ſo well, and that villaine that is with ye. By Sainct Mary (anſwered Ambades) you doe mee wrong, to thinke ſo badly of mee, holding you in ſuch reputation, that if I could haue conquered two ſuch as you are, I could vaunt thereof among the beſt knights in the world; for I hold ye to be but a couple of baſe Groomes. Theſe words mooued Norandel to ſuch choller, that he preſently replyed, Baſe Gromes: Haſt thou any ſuch in thy pay or wages? If thou holdeſt vs in no better eſteeme, come downe from thy Caſtell wall, and thou ſhalt ſoone ſee, that a Groom of my breeding, can knocke a bigger knaue then thou art. But if thou conquereſt mee, then boldly make thy vaunt, to haue foyled one of the greateſt enemies, that eyther thou or Archalaus can haue.
                  Gentle words (anſwered Ambades) haue not I tolde thee already, that I meane not to meddle with any ſuch paltry companions? what honour then can be had by ſo baſe conqueſt? Tell not me of thy hatred to my Couſin Archalaus, thou art vnworthy to ſpeake of a man of his merit; who, as he cares not for thy loue or kindneſſe, ſo he dares thee to thy vttermoſt malice againſt him. So, bending a Turkiſhe Bowe, hee let ſlye three or four ar
                        •
                     owes at them, which

cauſed Galaor and Norandel to part thence, ſmyling heartily to them-ſelues, that they had bin ſo deceiued by two treacherous women. And yet (quoth Norandel) mee thinkes, they lik't their wine ſo well, as they will grieue for the miſſe thereof, when they remember vs. And howſoeuer they haue beguiled our expectation, yet I can bee well content to be mockt ſo againe, paying no dearer charges then wee haue done.
                  They rode on ſtill thus merily ieſting, till about ſome three or foure dayes after, they came to the Port of Arſill, where they found a Barke ready bound for Gaule, whereinto they entred, and the winde ſate ſo fitting for them, that (without hinderance or impeachment, they landed where King Perion then ſoiourned. At that inſtant, Amadis was walking on the Sea-ſhore▪ accompanied with his Brother Floreſtan, & he remembring his Oriana, ſent many a longing looke towardes London,
                  
                  But ſo ſoone as hee beheld the Barke to caſt Anker in the Port, hee ſaid to his Brother Floreſtan. Let vs goe learne of them, who are come hither to take landing, if they can tell vs any happy tidings. Goe we then (replyed Floreſtan, for perhaps we may meete with ſome of our acquaintance. So walking downe to the Shoare, Amadis ſaw Galaor already come forth of the Ship, and Norandel following him; wherepon he went and embraced his brother.
                  As yet hee had no knowledge of Norandel, but Floreſtan had formerly ſeen him, telling him, that he was the baſtard Sonne to King Liſuart, and companion to Galaor, as a ſo, one of the beſt knights of his age, & ſo he did worthily declare himſelfe; in the battels at the Burning Lake, where many men of marke ended their liues. Neuertheleſſe, he was then ſcarcely knowen to bee the Kings Sonne, neither would his Father make any auouchment of him, vntill the ouerthrow of King Aranigne: but there he performed ſuch deeds of Armes, that the King himſelfe greatly gloried, he had begotten ſo famous a knight; & ther
                        •
                     
                     fore cared not (that day) who tooke knowledge of him.
                  Not a little glad was Amadis of his arriuall, and for his Siſter Orianaes ſake, hee gaue him the more kind and gracious welcome, ſending preſently to King Perion, to aduertiſe him of their landing, who came to meete them, and embraced Norandel in moſt louing manner, feaſting them royally and magnificently three dayes together. On the fourth day following, Amadis (who formerly had reſolued on his departure from Gaule, to purſue the ſearch of ſtrange aduentures) finding the King at fitte and conuenient leyſure, he thus ſp
                        •
                     ke vnto him. Sir, my long abiding heere with you, & diſcontinuance from the vſe of Armes, hath bin the cauſe of much lauiſh language to my diſgrace. Wherefore I humbly entreate your Maieſty, to licence my departure to morrow morning. Sonne, anſwered the King, I hold your honour in ſuch precious eſteem, that notwithſtanding pate

                     all loue and affection, which well may make me loth to leaue your company. I am content, that you ſhall part hence at your owne pleaſure.
                  By my ſaith (quoth Galaor) were it not for one queſt whereto I and my companion

And becauſe none of vs could attaine to the knowledge of them by reaſon of their ſudden parting thence vpon our victory: my companion and I haue ſolemnely vowed and promiſed, according to the cuſtome of Great Brittaine, to ſpend one whole yeare in the queſt of them, before we giue ouer, or vndertake any other enterpriſe. Sonne (ſaid the King) when heauen pleaſeth, you may haue newes of thoſe knights, and ſooner then you look for.

                     ſing on many things, till the due houre summoned them to reſt. The next morning, Amadis being armed, went to heare Maſſe; and hauing taken leaue of the King, mounted on horſeback, accompanied only with Gandalin and the Dwarfe. Notwithſtanding, the King would needes bring him ſomewhat on the way, out of the Citty; and as they rode together, Amadis thus ſpake. Sir, you know what trauaile my brother and Norandel haue bound thē
                     ſelues to by vow, which will bee paines without any profit, except you pleaſe therein to eaſe them: for, by no meanes poſſible can they compaſſe their intent, but one of vs three muſt end their royle. Wherefore, I thinke it expedient, if your Highneſſe were ſo pleaſed, that when you haue forſaken my company, you would tell them the whole diſcourſe, and what we did in the ſeruice of King Liſuart. Since you will haue it ſo (replyed the King) it ſhall be done. Floreſtan was very deſirous to haue ridden along with Amadis, but hee would not permit it: becauſe in trauayling alone, hee had the more free paſſage for his conſiderations concerning Oriana; and beſide, he aymed at aduentures of no meane perill, the honor wherof ſhould be his owne onely.
                  
                     Anadis being gone, as Fortune beſt pleaſed to direct him, and the King with his company returned home to the Court: he called for Galaor and Norandel, with whom he diſcourſed in this maner. You haue betaken your ſelues to a ſtrange kinde of queſt, wherein (I am certaine) you will haue but ſlender ſucceſſe, except it be in this kingdome. And therefore, account your comming hither to be fortunate, in that I can ſhorten your long-intended trauaile.
                  Know then, that the knights you ſeeke after, were none other then Amadis, Floreſtan and my ſelfe. So he declared the whole manner of their enterpriſe, and how at the very inſtant of their proceeding, Vrganda the Vnknowen, ſent them the coate Armours, with the Serpents, the

golden Helmet for Amadis, the white for himſelfe, and the greene for Floreſtan: ſhewing all inſtantly to them, and what harme had happened to them in the battel.
                  Sir, ſaid Galaor, heauen hath bin very fauourable to vs, conſidering our long-intended time of trauaile: onely to enter the Combate with them, and make knowne to the whole world beſide (in extinguiſhing their glory) that one of vs deſerueth aſmuch as the beſt of them. Yea (quoth the King) but it is much better to fall out thus, as now it doth.
                  Then he reported to them, how in their returning from the battell, they chanced to bee impriſoned by Archalaus, and in what vngentle manner he vſed them. That villain, (anſwered Galaor) not long after eſcaped out of my hands, by a moſt queint and cunning treachery. Relating at large, how they met with him, their courteſie to the Damoſels, and their treaſon afterward at the Caſtell of Ambades.
                  
                  The King walked thence with them to his owne Chamber, where all the Armours were, whereof they had ſpoken: which they preſently knew, as hauing well obſerued them in the battell, Norandel importuning the King ſo earneſtly, that he frankly gaue him them. Afterward, hauing remained there about the ſpace of fourteene dayes, they obtayned leaue to part thence; and paſſing into Great Brittaine, arriued at the Court of King Liſuart: who, not a little glad of their comming, inſtantly ſent for them, to vnderſtand what had befalne them in their queſt.
                  Sir, (ſaid Norandel) wee haue brought ye happy newes, and anſwerable to your owne deſire. In teſtimony whereof, behold heere the Armes of them, that perfourmed ſuch worthy ſeruice for you, and in ſuch a time of vrgent neceſſity. This white Helmet was then worne by King Perion, and your ſelfe ſaw him in the place, where it coſt many the price of their liues. This greene Helmet belonged to the gentle knight Floreſtan, who well declared how hardily hee could handle his Sword. And this of gold appertained to Amadis, whom deeds of arms cannot be ſeconded by any: for by his aſſiſtance, the benefit of the battaile redounded to you; but the honour thereof to his immortall glory. How could they (quoth the King) come ſo conueniently to helpe vs?
                  Heereupon Norandel diſcourſed from point to point, how euery thing had happened, without the leaſt omiſſion, to the great contentment of all the hearers. Beleeue me, ſaid the King, I perceiue that King Perion hath bin long time your fauourer, and him I neuer ſaw out of his Armes, albeit I greatly deſire to know him. You ſhall then know (anſwered Norandel) a wiſe vertuous and moſt magnanimious Prince.
                  And on my faith (quoth Grumedan) his Sonnes come not behind him in any of his beſt parts. Theſe words were hardly pleaſing to the King, though hee made no outward ſhew thereof: but falling from this maner of diſcourſe, hee departed thence, leauing Galaor and Norandel, to whom Oriana and Mabila inſtantly comming, they deliuered moſt kinde commendations to them, both from Queene Eliſena and the Princeſſe Mabila. Declaring afterward, that Amadis was departed from Gaule into farre diſtant Countreyes, to ſeeke after ſtraunge aduentures, which tydings

made them very ſorrowfull, becauſe they feared to heare no newes of him in a long while after.
               
               
                  CHAP. VII.
                  
                     How Eſplandian was neuriſhed by the old Hermite Naſcian. And what aduentures happened to Amadis in the meane while, changing his knowne name, and calling himſelfe, the Knight with the greene Sword.
                  
                  
                     
                        ESplandian hauing attayned to the age of foure yeares, or thereabout; Naſcian well knowing, that now it was fit time, to begin his inſtruction in vertuous exerciſes: ſent to his Siſter, that ſhe ſhould bring the childe to him, which ſhee accordingly did. The Hermit perceiuing his growth, to be beyond the ordinary ſtature of ſuch young yeares, beſides his beauty and commendable forme: conceiued in his minde, that heauen had thus preſerued him to ſome eſpeciall end: ſo that, if formerly hee preſumed of his future happines; he gaue more credit now thereto then euer he had done; endeauouring by all meanes poſſible, to haue him taught all commendable qualities, fit for the knowledge of a Gentle-man; embracing, kiſſing, and vſing him, as if he had bin his owne naturall Sonne.
                  And ſurely it was not without great reaſon, becauſe the childe had alwayes declared, as apparant ſignes of loue to him, and rather more, then to his Nurſe, whoſe breſts hee ſuckt. In regard whereof, Naſcian concluded to keep him ſtill, ſending his Siſter home to her owne houſe: yet requiring the company of one of her Sonnes, that might bee as a play-fellow to Eſplandian, who had ſuckt with him of the ſame milke, whereto ſhee willingly condiſcended.
                  From that time forward, the Hermit was their ſole guide and gouernour, they liuing there in the nature of brethren; and for their dayly delight and exerciſe, he would ſend them to hunt in the Forreſt; ſo that at one time (among other) they riſing earely in the morning to finde ſome game, Eſplandian waxing faint and weary, ſate downe by a Riuer ſide, and fell aſleepe. The Lyonneſſe (whereof we haue formerly ſpoken) comming thither, and finding this new kind of prey, ſmelling at his face, began to fawne and moue his taile pleaſingly, euen as if Nature had made an eſpeciall interdiction, of touching, or doing any harme to the creature, which her ſelfe had before bin partly a Nurſe vnto. And appeared to know him ſo perfectly, that had bin a while ſuckled with her milke: as inſtantly, without offering the leaſt violence, ſhe couched down at his feete, ſmelling, and licking his hands and garments. Which, when his wakingcompanion perceiued, being ouer-come with feare▪ he ranne home to the Hermit, crying to him, that he had left his brother with a great dogge, that would eate him, as hee lay ſleeping on the banke of a Riuer, he not hauing any power to wake him.
                  The holy Hermite, dearely affecting

                     Eſplandian, grew doubtfull of his ſafety; and commaunded his young Nephew, to bring him where he left him; which preſently he did. Drawing neere to the place, he beheld the Boy and the Lyonneſſe playing together: when Eſplandian beholding the Hermite, ſaide vnto him. Father, doth this goodly dog belong to vs. Sonne, anſwered Naſcian, ſhee is ſent of God, to whom onely all things appertaineth.
                  Truely Father, replyed Eſplandian, I ſhould well like his abyding with vs, and would make vſe of him in our hunting. When the reuerent man heard him ſpeake ſo confidently, he grew as reſolute in perſwaſion, and going neerer to Eſplandian, ſaw him kiſſe the Lyonneſſe, euen as familiarly, as ſhee had bin a Spaniell.
                  Heereupon the Hermite ſaid vnto him. Sonne, would you giue her ſomewhat to eate? Yea Father, anſwered Eſplandian, if I had any thing to giue her. With that, the Hermit tooke out of his Scrip the legge of a Deere, which a Hunter had beſtowed on him, and giuing it to the Lad, he threw it to the Lyonneſſe, ſaying. Heere Dogge, eate this. The Lyonneſſe tooke it; and while ſhee was feeding on it, Eſplandian played with her eares, pawes and taile, euen as familiarly as himſelfe pleaſed, the beaſt offering him no other diſlyking, then if hee had bin one of her whelpes. Such perfect knowledge did ſhe take of him, and (euen by naturall inſtinct) loued him ſo dearely, as ſhe followed him thence to the Hermitage, and (from that time forward) would neuer willingly leaue his company, except when ſhe went to ſeeke ſome prey, which ſhe would alſo bring home with her, euen as if ſhe had beene a houſhold ſeruant.
                  And both the Laddes grew into ſuch familiarity with her, that they would leade her oftentimes in a Leaſſe on hunting with them, as if ſhe had bin a Greyhound for game. Which Naſcian well noting, prouided them Bowes fit fot their ſtrēgth, wherewith they continually vſed to kill Harts, Hindes, Roe-bucks, and ſuch like, ſending ſtill the Lyonneſſe after ſuch game as they had wounded.
                  But heere wee purpoſe now to leaue them for a while; returning to Amadis, who being departed from Gaule, entred the Country of Alemaigne, where he perfourmed ſuch rare actions of Chiualry, that euery tongue talked onely of him, and there he was commonly called, the knight with the greene Sword, or, the knight of the Dwarfe, becauſe Ardan ſtill attended on him, and there he ſpent foure whole yeares, before he returned to the Encloſed Iſland, not hearing any tydings from his Oriana, which was his very greateſt affliction, becauſe hee found no pains, labor or ill ſucceſſe, any way comparable to the want of her preſence.
                  So long he trauailed from one part to another, that about the beginning of the Spring-time, he arriued in Bohemia, neere to King Tafinor, on whom Patin the Emperour of Rome made ſharpe warre: who hated Amadis more then any man elſe, for the reaſon formerly declared in the ſecond Booke. Hee ryding purpoſely toward the camp, King Tafinor, who for a time, had taken truce with his enemy, was then flying his Gerfaulcon at a Heron, which fell at the horſe feete of Amadis.
                  
                  Now, becauſe none of the horſe-men could come at her, in regard

of the moiſt and marſhie ground hindering them, the knight of the greene Sword alighted, and tooke her vp, demaunding the Falconers, if they were diſpleaſed thereat: And they anſwered no. Soon after came the King, who had coaſted all along the Riuer for paſſage, and ſeeing the knight ſo compleatly armed, ſtood in ſome ſuſpition of himſelf; till he further noted the greene ſcabberd of his Sword, being the ſame which he had in lone of the ancient knight, as hath bin formerly declared.
                  The King had many times heard much fame of his proweſſe, and was ſo well pleaſed with his happy arriuall, that he entreated his company to the City, which Amadis denied him not; but ryding along with him, the King thus ſpake. Sir, I haue a long while deſired, that I might be but worthy of ſuch a companion as you ſeeme to be. My Lord (anſwered Amadis,) the liberal renown of you and your bounty, which makes you famous in many kingdomes, drewe me hither, onely to offer you my ſeruice, if any way it may be acceptable to yee, becauſe I haue heard, that you are warred on by a potent Prince, that giues ye no meane moleſtation. You ſay very true (replied the King;) but I truſt in heauen, and by the meanes of your helpe, to ſee a ſhort iſſue out of theſe troubles, Fortune hauing ſo conueniently guided you hither.
                  By this time they were arriued at the Palace, where the King commanded he ſhould be lodged, and Graſandor his Sonne to keepe him company. Now, in regard that the truce taken betweene the two Armies, was vpon the point of ending: each ſide ſtood on their beſt defence, and the ſeuerall Campes prepared for all attempts whatſoeuer.
                  King Tafinor walking one day abroade, to vnderſtand ſome tydings from the enemy, hee beheld afarre off twelue knights come riding towards him; and as they drew neerer, he knew the Shield of Garadan, borne by his Squire, himſelfe being a neere kinſman to the Emperour; and they came not to fight, but to parlee. The King bare little affection to this Garadan, becauſe hee procured and raiſed this warre, and well he knew, that his comming was but to occaſion ſome freſh grieuance; which made ſtearne anger mount vp into his face, ſo that hee could not forbeare, but ſaid. Ah trecherous villaine, thou haſt already done me ſo many miſchiefes, that I haue iuſt occaſion to hate thee ſo long as I liue.
                  Sir, (anſwered the Knight of the greene Sword,) it may be, he commeth to yee for ſome good end; therefore, it ſhall well become ye, now to diſſemble all paſſion, entertayning them with good lookes, not taking offence at any thing they ſay, in regard they come to yee as Ambaſſadours from the Emperour their Maiſter.
                  Kinde friend (quoth the King) I allow of your good aduice, and wil be directed thereby; though it is no meane griefe to me, to haue ſo great an enemy neere me. Scarcely were theſe words ended, but Garadan and his troupe ſaluted the King, who gaue them kinde welcome deſiring them, that before any ſpeeches paſſed, they would goe along with him to him to his Palace. But Garadan made refuſall, ſhewing himſelfe as brauely proud and preſumptuous, as formerly he was wont to do, ſpeaking thus.
                  King Tafinor, thou muſt vnderſtand

the occaſion of our comming to thee, and before thou parteſt from this place, thou muſt make vs anſwere, ſuch as ſhall ſeeme beſt to thy ſelfe, without aduice or conſulting with any one but thy ſelfe. For in thee onely lyeth the concluſion of two things, wherewith I am to acquaint thee from the Emperour: otherwiſe, aſſure thy ſelf, before three dayes can be paſſed ouer, the battel will fall out to be ſo cruell and bloody, as it exceedeth all poſſibility, but thou and thy Country will bee vtterly loſt.
                  With theſe wordes he deliuered him a Miſſiue of credence, for further confirmation of his ſpeeches. Beleeue me Lord Garadan, (anſwered the King,) I hope that the Emperour, and you, wil be more kinde to me, then appeareth by your meſſage: wherefore, deferre no further time, but deliuer the remainder of your Commiſſion, that I may yeeld you ſatisfaction to my power.
                  
                     Garadan hearing the King to anſwere ſo mildely, began ſomewhat to qualifie his owne choller, replyed thus. King Tafinor, the Emperour my Maiſter, hauing power ſufficiently to preuaile againſt, yea, & vtterly to ruinate a more potent Prince then you are, being deſirous to make an end of this warre, to prouide for other his more neceſſary occaſions, makes tender to you of two conditions, whereby you may enioy peace if you pleaſe, or elſe not.
                  Firſt, if Combate may be performed of an hundred of your knights, againſt as many of his; or a thouſand to a thouſand, the conquerors leauing the vanquiſhed in ſuch caſe, as to them ſhall ſeeme beſt. Or, if you finde this demaund to be ouer-great, hee is content to allow of twelue againſt twelue, of which number I meane my ſelfe to be one, who doe thinke my ſelfe able to fight with ſixe of your knights, although your ſelfe made one in perſon. Therefore, of theſe two elections, chuſe which ſhall appeare the eaſieſt to you: for otherwiſe, be well aſſured, that, ſetting aſide all other affaires, his Army ſhall neuer part from this Country, till you be wholly vanquiſhed, which will be very ſpeedily, becauſe you are not able long to withſtand his potent proceedings.
                  
                     Don Garadan (anſwered the knight of the greene Sword) were you to ſpeake to a King of much leſſe merit, yet deſeruing more reſpect and reuerence, mee thinkes you ſhould bee more mindfull of your owne behauiour, in vſing ſuch proud threatnings concerning your ſelfe, ill beſeeming a Gentleman, appertayning to ſo great a Prince. Notwithſtanding, he may make you what anſwere ſhall like him: albeit, in mine opinion, he ſhould firſt vnderſtand, what aſſurance you can make of your ſeuerall offers, if hee conſent to your demaunds. When Garadan heard the knight of the greene Sword ſpeake ſo reſolutely in the Kings preſence, hee maruayled greatly what he ſhould be, and looking on him with a diſdainfull eye, he ſaid.
                  Beleeue me knight, it appeareth well by your language, but much more by your boldnes, that you are not onely a ſtranger in theſe parts, but alſo to all honour and ciuility. And it amazeth me, that the King will ſuffer yee to ſpeake ſo ſottiſhly in his preſence. Neuertheleſſe, if his opinion of you be ſo good, as not to diſallow what you haue ſaid, let him firſt conſent to my demaunds, and then I will anſwere him as I ſee occaſion.

Goe you on, quoth the King, with the reſt of your meſſage: for whatſoeuer, the knight of the greene Sword hath ſpoken on my behalfe, ſhall bee maintayned, if in our power it lye to perfourme it.
                  
                     Garadan became now more amazed, then formerly he had beene; perceiuing, that the man whom he had inburied in wordes, was the knight with the greene Sword, whoſe renowne had already ſpred it ſelfe thorow all Countries, and made his ſtout heart ſomewhat to tremble: Neuertheleſſe, he held it as his chiefeſt happineſſe, that hee ſhould haue now ſo apt an occaſion to combate with him; for, he was ſo ouer-weening and vaine-glorious, that he made no doubt of preuayling againſt him, and that very eaſily. Which ydle fond opinion, cauſed him to loſe all the honour and high reputation, wherein he had liued till that time, promiſing himſelfe an aſſurance of victory, which afterward fell to his enemy. And waxing more chollericke then before, he returned this anſwere to the knight of the greene Sword.
                  Seeing that the King giues you ſuch power and authority, why are yee ſo ſlow in electing the fight? Becauſe (anſwered the knight of the Dwarfe) it is a matter of ſuch importance, as well deſerueth to haue the aduice of the Princes and Ladies of this kingdome.
                  And it would highly content mee, if the King pleaſed ſo much to honour mee, as to entertaine me for one of the twelue hundred, or thouſand, that are to bee appointed for this fight: for no man can bee more deſirous then I am, to doe any ſeruice againſt you, on whom I would not onely aduenture my beſt blood, but ſerue for him in any place, where he ſhall pleaſe to imploy mee. My deare friend, (replyed the King,) I moſt heartily thanke you, and will not refuſe the offer you haue made me: but doe requeſt withall, that you would make election of the fights in my behalfe, according as you ſhall iudge it beſt, and for our moſt aduantage.
                  In good ſooth Sir, (replyed the knight of the green Sword) therein you ſhall pardon mee, (if you pleaſe;) for you haue about yee ſo many good knights, all louing and reſpectfull of your honour, that if you demaund their aduice in this caſe, their counſell will be both faithfull and honourable. Neuertheleſſe, before you ſhall faile in this, or any other matter that Garadan can vrge; preſume vpon my loyalty and ready ſeruice. Onely let me entreate your Maieſty, to demaund, what power he hath receiued from his Maiſter, to warrant the offers already propoſed: and accordingly you may ſhape your anſwere, for the acceptance or refuſall.
                  Saucie companion, (anſwered Garadan,) I know thy meaning well enough, as ſeeking how to ſhrinke backe, and ſhunne all the offers made for fight. If you knewe mee well, (ſaid the knight of the Dwarfe) it may be, you would hold better eſtimation of me, then raſhly your raſh opinion ſeemeth to deliuer.
                  And doe not thinke it ſtraunge, that I gaue ſuch aduice to the King, as you haue heard: for if your ſeuerall offers ſhould afterward bee diſallowed or diſclaymed;

they may bee the cauſe of ſtearner warre then yet▪ hath beene, in ſteed of a milder purchaſing peace.
                  
                     Garadan could no longer forbeare, but drew a Letter forth of his ſleeue, ſealed with thirty faire Seales, in the middeſt of all which Seales, ſtood that, that belonged to the Emperour: And deliuering it to the King, he bade him to conſider on a ſpeedie anſwere. By my faith, (quoth the King,) ſeeing you are in ſuch great haſte, you ſhall be anſwered before you part from this place. So, withdrawing thence, & calling ſome of the chiefeſt Lords of the company: he entreated them to aduiſe him particularly what were beſt to be done in this vrgent neceſſity. Then each man deliuered his opinion, which fell out to be different and contrary, becauſe ſome approued the fight of an hundred againſt an hundred, and others of twelue to twelue; but the greater number temporized, and gaue the like counſell, for continuance of warre, in manner and forme as it had beene begunne. For (quoth they) to hazard a kingdome vpon the ſtrength of ſo few men, is a matter very dangerous. And moreouer, it appeareth by Garadans owne words, that the Emperour himſelfe firſt beginneth to grow weary of this warre, and (it may be) is ſo ouerpreſſed in other places, as he will be (thereby) enforced to withdraw his forces, and leaue vs in peace againſt his owne will.
                  Sir, ſaid Count Galtines, it were very expedient (in my minde) to craue the counſell of the knight of the greene Sword. Now, was not he preſent at this aſſembly, and therefore hee was immediately ſent for; and being come, the King thus ſpake vnto him.
                  My worthy Friend, you haue heard at large the ſpeeches of Don Garadan to mee, ſo commanded (as he ſaith) by his Maiſter the Emperour: let me therefore entreate yee, faire Sir, to aduiſe vs what you thinke meeteſt for our anſwere, becauſe the ſeuerall opinions of our Lords heere preſent, are ſo different, as wee know not which to elect for our beſt courſe. Then he related to him (in order) all circumſtances that had paſſed among them without omiſsion of the leaſt particle, and the knight of the greene Sword returned him this anſwere.
                  Sir, I am ſure you can ſufficiently vnderſtand, that the end and iſſue of ſuch attempts, are onely in the hand of Heauen, and not guided or directed by the iudgment of man; but in regard you would haue mine opinion in this caſe, I will acquaint yee with my very vttermoſt power and ability.
                  If then Sir, I had but one Caſtell onely, and an hundred knights at my commaund, and were beſieged by ſuch an enemy, whoſe power twiſe exceeded mine. If heauen affoorded mee ſo much happineſſe, to cauſe him condiſcend to a peacefull concluſion, vnder haxard of mine owne ſtrength, I ſhould confeſſe my ſelf beholding to him.
                  Neuertheleſſe, honourable Lords (ſpeaking to the other Barons and knights there preſent) whatſoeuer I preferre as beſt in this caſe: forbeare not you to counſell the King, according to the fidelity wherein you ſtand bound and obliged to him. Onely my moſt humble requeſt is, that hee would ſo much honor mee, as to ranke mee among their

number that ſhall be appointed for fight.
                  Let me tell you Sir, (replyed the King,) that I now call to minde, what I heard once reported, concerning King Perion of Gaule, hauing the like occaſion in hand, as ours now is, againſt King Abies of Ireland, who forcibly had taken from him a great part of his kingdome. Hee was deliuered by a ſingle Combate, which a young knight (not aged fully eighteen yeares) vndertooke againſt the ſaid King Abies, who was reckoned among the very beſt and boldeſt knights in the whole world: yet was he ſlaine, and King Perion put in poſſeſſion of all hee had formerly loſt.
                  But aboue all, as a matter moſt deſeruing note, hee then knew him to be his owne Sonne, that had wonne for him that worthy victory: then tearmed the Gentleman of the Sea, and afterward called Amadis de Gaule. Thus our Lord (in one day) beſtowed on him two mighty bleſſings, by the recouery both of his kingdome and Son. Wherefore then (in the like caſe) ſhould not I imitate ſo worthy a man as King Perion, and eſſay to deliuer my people out of thoſe great tribulations, as haue afflicted them by a warre ſo long and tedious? Well may I graunt the Combat of twelue of my knights, againſt as many of the enemy: in regard that I am perſwaded of them, as by the help of heauen, and the right of Iuſtice being on our ſide, they will beare away the honour of victory. What is your opinion, Knight of the greene Sword?
                  Sir, anſwered he, I neuer had knowledge of that Amadis; yet I long time frequented the Country of Gaule, where it hath beene my good happe to ſee two of his brethren, who are no way inferior to him in proweſſe, and I haue heard likewiſe, that according as you haue▪ declared, ſo it fortuned to King Perion.
                  
                  Now, as concerning the fight of twelue to twelue, whereas your Maieſty hath reſolued: before God I ſpeake it, had I beene in your place, I ſhould haue done the like.
                  Nay, moreouer Sir, if Garadan had demaunded a much leſſe number, let him be now aſſured, he ſhould not haue beene denyed, were it to the aduenturing mine owne perſon againſt his. And if it pleaſed you but to tell him as much, I would willingly hazard my life, to abate his pride, that prates ſo contemptibly of all men elſe, preſuming vpon his owne vaine glory.
                  I hold it better, (quoth the King,) that you ſhould be twelue equally in number; and therefore I will bethinke my ſelfe, to finde out eleuen of the beſt knights in my kingdome, that may accompanie you in this attempt. For which, the knight of the greene Sword thanked him.
                  This being done, the King returned to Garadan, and ſpake thus.
                  Lord Garadan, you haue demaunded the Combate of twelue to twelue, and I haue yeelded thereunto, vnder thoſe conditions before offered, and to morrow is the day, if you are as ready as wee will be.
                  By my ſoule Sir, anſwered Garadan, you yeeld mee the greateſt contentment that euer could happen to me, and I could wiſh (if it were poſſible) that your men were as ready, as thoſe that aduenture

for the Emperour. Garadan, (replied the knight of the greene Sword) ſo the King were ſo pleaſed, and you poſſeſſed with the like deſire of the Combate, as heere you appeare to make ſhew of: I would anſwere your heate this very inſtant houre.
                  What? (quoth Garadan) doeſt thou doubt that I will flye from thee? were I ſure to be Emperour of Rome; I would refuſe that dignity, rather then the offer thou haſt made me. For, if I haue not man-hood ſufficient, whereby to ouer-come thee, and take thy head from thy ſhoulders before it be night, I will willingly forfeite mine owne in the Field. The like hope of ſucceſſe (replyed the knight of the Dwarfe) haue I ouer thee: let vs then without longer trifling the time) ſee, whom Fortune will allow the beſt fauour vnto.
                  So both withdrew thence to arme themſelues, returning againe within a ſhort while after; and to the knights that accompanied Garadan, thus he ſpake. If euer you beheld a braue encoūter at the launce, doe but obſerue, with what skill and dexterious iudgment, I ſhall giue entertaine to this bold companion, that dare make tryall of his poore fortune againſt me; and repute me neuer to weare Helmet on my head, if I doe not deliuer his head to the Emperour, and leaue the Country quiet, not ſuffering any of you to lay hand to weapon.
                  While Garadan held on theſe brauing ſpeeches, the knight of the greene Sword, being at the other end of the Field, cryed out aloud to him to defend himſelfe. Then couering themſelues with their Shields, couching their Launces, and giuing ſpurre to their Courſers: they ranne againſt each other with ſuch violence, that the knight of the greene Sword was halfe amazed.
                  But Garadan fell to the ground, ſo farre loſt in himſelfe, that hee lay a long while; vnable to moue either hand or foote, for the launce had pierced thorow his arme, which did put him to intollerable anguiſh.
                  Then the knight of the greene Sword, perceiuing him in ſuch a ſtrange perplexitie, alighted from his horſe, to ſee whether hee were dead or no; and as hee came neere him, Garadan being reſtored from his trance, ſtarted vp quickly, laying hand to his Sword, as if he had felt no harme at all.
                  Now beganne a very fierce and cruell battaile betweene them, and it could not eaſily be iudged, which ſide had the better, becauſe each ſtood ſo ſtiffely to the other, as it mooued no meane admiration in the beholders. And had it not beene for Garadans much enfeebling, by the great abundance of blood iſſuing from the wound receiued in his arme, hee had giuen his enemie more occaſion of trouble and daunger, then as now hee could doe in ſo weake an eſtate.
                  At length he found himſelfe ſo ſpent and weary, that to recouer breath, hee thus ſpake vnto him. Beleeue mee Knight of the greene Sword, in regard that I now know yee better then euer I did, I haue iuſter reaſon of wiſhing worſe to ye then before.
                  Notwithſtanding, becauſe it appeares to mee, that you beginne to waxe faint, I am well contented, to ſuffer yee (for a while) to reſt and eaſe your ſelfe. How? (replyed Amadis) doeſt thou now talke of reſt, and madeſt vaunt

not long ſince to haue my head ſo lightly? Aſſure thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt take no reſt, nor I neither, till one of vs two reſt in death on the ground; and therefore looke to thy ſelfe I would aduiſe thee. Thus ſpeaking, hee charged him fierce, and fiercer, and at laſt let fall ſuch a weightie blow on the toppe of his Helmet, as cleft quite thorow the ſteele, head and braine together, ſo that he fell downe dead in the field. Whereat the Knight of the greene Sword was not a little glad, not ſo much for the ill-will he bare him, as for the diſpleaſure he imagined to haue done the Emperour, and eſpeciall contentment of King Tafinor.
                  
                  So wiping his Sword, he put it vp into the ſheathe, rendring thankes to GOD for the victory he had giuen him.
                  Then came the King, and (embracing him) demaunded how hee fared. So well my Lord, anſwered Amadis, as I haue no wound at all to hinder mee, from entring a freſh fight to morrow morning, with whomſoeuer you ſhall pleaſe to appoint mee. Nay, by my faith (quoth the King) you haue done enough for this buſineſſe. Then was hee conducted into the Citty, with the greateſt triumphe that poſſibly could bee.
                  In the meane while, the Romanes carried thence the body of Garadan, ſo daunted with his death, that all deſire of farther fighting was vtterly loſt: but concluded together, to tell the Emperour, that their companion had engadged them (in meere deſpight, adn his owne raſhnes) to decide this difference by Armes: wherein he would needes (ouer deſperatly) aduenture himſelfe alone, and ſo loſt the day.
                  No one was againſt this determination, but a young knight, named Arquiſil, a neere kinſman to the Emperour, who perceiuing the bad diſpoſition of the reſt, and the iniury they not onely ſhould doe to the Emperour Patin, and to them-ſelues, but likewiſe to the whole Empire, ſpake thus vnto them. How now Lords? will you thus forget your ſelues, and loſe the reputation of our Empire? Shall it bee bruited abroade, that eleuen Romane knights (thorow feare of death) were ſo cowardly-minded, as not to combate with twelue Allemaignes, groſſe-headed fellowes, and very ſlenderly experienced in Armes? So helpe me God, put me alone vpon the enterpriſe, and if you ſtand in doubt of him that hath foyled Garadan, leaue him onely to me, and ſettle your ſelues to the other; for I dare aſſure yee, if our hearts bee good, wee cannot but ſpeed ſucceſſefully, and recouer that blemiſh, to our honour, which the misfortune of our friendes hath throwen vpon vs.
                  Let vs fight then, and die euery man of vs, rather then deferre it any longer: conſidering, we rather ought to make choice of a death ſo honourable, then liue hereafter in perpetuall ſhame, or ſo wretched a condition of life, as ours muſt needs be.
                  Aſſuredly, the valiant words of this young Prince, preuayled ſo farre vpon the others puſillanimity, and made them ſo confounded with ſhame, as they all reſolued to tempt their fortunes, and euen proſtitute their liues to any perill, rather then to depart thence, with ſuch diſhonour.
                  They were not ſo prompt and

ready for the Combate; but the knight of the greene Sword (hating all ſloth and negligence) was as forward to moue the King therein, deſiring, that the next morning hee would appoint the other knights to be in readines, acording to promiſe, & they would accompany them to the field. But the King would faine haue deferred it longer, in regard of the woundes he receiued by Garadan: and being vnable to preuaile with him, he thus ſpake. Knight of the greene Sword, you haue already done ſo much for me, as I dare not well deny you any thing you can demand of mee. And ſeeing you will needs haue an end of this controuerſie, my Sonne Graſandor ſhall beare you company; for in a better occaſion he can neuer aduenture his life, nor with a man of greater merit.
                  Sir, anſwered Amadis, you ſhould reſerue him for a more ſerious buſineſſe; without hazarding him in ſo meane a matter, and where there is ſo ſlender need. Ah Sir knight, replyed Graſandor, would you offer me a greater wrong then any man elſe can doe? By the faith I beare to my King and Father, if I had ſo much power ouer you, as I freely graunt you haue on me: I would then entreat you ſo farre to honour me, as that I might keepe you company all my life-time; and I could rather wiſh that I had neuer beene borne, then not to make one in this elected number, and in a caſe of ſuch importance. Seeing it is your pleaſure (quoth the knight of the greene Sword) and that you will needs be one in the fight, I make no doubt but God will aſſiſt vs; for being in your company, it cannot chuſe but wee all ſhall ſpeede the better.
                  So euery one withdrew vntill the next morning when the King came to ſee his knight, whom hee found ready armed; and perceiuing his Armour to be greatly impaired, he ſaid.
                  My worthy Friend, I think it not fit, that you ſhould enter into ſo dangerous a fight, ſo ſlenderly prouided as you are. Wherefore, let me entreatye to take other Armes, which in my iudgement will bee more conuenient for ye, both in ſecurity, eaſe and aptnes. Heereupon, he ſent for an Armour, which hee had kept (a long while) for one of the beſt in the world, and preſenting it to the knight of the greene Sword, ſaid. Eſſay Sir, whether it will ſit ye or no, and (for my ſake) arme your ſelfe therewith, which I beſtow on yee with as good a hart, as euer I kiſt Lady in my life. Moſt humbly did Amadis giue him thankes; and looking on the Sword, perceiuing it ſo well appointed, he drew it forth of the ſheathe, when it appeared ſo fair and goodly to him, as he ſaid to himſelfe, that he neuer ſaw one of more perfection, then that belonging to King Liſuart, and his owne, which he dearely affected, aſwell for the goodnes thereof, as becauſe he wonne it by the power of loue, as we haue formerly declared in the ſecond Booke, in which reſpect, he would not leaue it for the beſt in the world. But ſeeing that this other weapon did well deſerue, to come to the hand of ſome worthy knight: he entreated the Prince Graſandor to accept it, whereof he made no refuſall.
                  As they were beholding the reſt of the 
                        •…
                     rmour, newes was brought them, that the eleuen Romaine knights were in the field, and there attended their comming In regard whereof, eachman quickly armed himſelfe, and the twelue knights

rode forth, accompanied with the King, and many other: but when Arquiſil beheld them approaching neere, he thus ſpake to his companions.
                  Lords, friends and kinde companions, let me entreate ye to remember, that we go to fight; not onely to winne land for the Emperour, or to maintaine the promiſe made by Garadan, but for the honour of the whole Romane Empire. Moreouer, I haue ſpoke it, and once again do vrge it, to permit me to combate him, who yeſterday had the victory of our aſſociat. I ſee him come foremoſt, and he ſhall be the firſt (I hope) ouerthrowen: prepare then to meete them, and make ſpare of no man.
                  So taking their ſhields, they marched directly againſt their enemies; who perceiuing them to come nere, placed their launces, as they ought, charging manfully one another. Arquiſil met the knight of the green Sword, ſo full forward, that he brake his Launce vpon him in many ſhiuers: but if himſelfe had not quickly caught hold by the mayne of his horſe, the knight had layde him along on the ground; for he met him with ſuch a direct oppoſition, as he loſt his ſtirrops, and was quite out of his ſaddle. Afterward, perfecting his carriere, he met with one of the other, to whom he gaue ſo ſound a ſalutation on the height of his Helmet, as he diſarmed him thereof. At the ſame inſtant he was freſh charged by two together, and wounded ſo grieuouſly in the thigh, as he was neere falling: whereat hee grew ſo offended, that claſping hand to his Sword, he gaue ſo great a ſtroke to him that was neereſt him, as if hee had not receiued it at his beſt aduantage, he had beene immediatly ſlaine thereby. But the blow ſlyding by, lighted on the horſes neck, and on the legge of his rider, bearing them both together vnto the ground.
                  When Arquiſil ſaw that, he came behinde him, and gaue him ſuch a ſtroke on the Helmet, as made his eyes to ſparkle fire: notwithſtanding, hee knew ſo well how to reuenge himſelfe, that he cut off his left arme iuſt at the ſhoulder. Then began the fight to bee more fierce then before, becauſe they all came together pell mell; and although Arquiſil felt great pain by his ſo late receiued wound, and loſt his blood ſo extraordinarily; yet for all that, he gaue the by-ſtanders apparant teſtimony, that his heart was vnconquerable, and he ſtil maintained the fight, continuing as freſh and couragious as any of the reſt. Neuertheleſſe, at length both he and his companions were ſo ſhreudly handled, as the moſt part of them lay along on the earth, and himſelfe found no meanes, for enduring the ſharpe aſſaults of the knight of the greene Sword, who followed on him ſtill ſo inceſſantly, not permitting him the leaſt minutes ſpace of breathing, as he was well neere vnable to hold out any longer. Then Graſandor buckled with him, and charged him ſo mainely with all his might, that he inſtantly fell downe in a ſwoune. Whereupon he alighted from his horſe, making ſhewe as if he meant to ſmite off his head. But the knight of the greene Sword perſwaded him to the contrary, and going to him, tooke off his Helmet, that he might receiue ayre: when comming to himſelfe againe, he ſeemed not a little terrified, when hee perceiued his death ſo nere; where-upon he craued mercy of him. On my faith (quoth the knight) thou dyeſt, except thou yeeld thy ſelfe.

Alas, (ſaid hee) I ſubmit to your mercy.
                  Then he tooke him vp, and gaue him aſſurance of life. At which very inſtant came King Tafinor, who being ioyfull of ſo happy a victory, demaunded of the knight of the Dwarfe, how hee fared, & whether he were wounded or no. Sir, quoth he, I haue no wound ſo offenſiue to me, but I count it worthily receiued, in regard that you are ſo honorably ſerued. So mounting all on horſeback, they returned into the Citty, where the people ſtood in mighty crowds along the ſtreetes, crying out aloud. Bleſſed bee this good knight, by whom (if God bee ſo pleaſed) we ſhall haue peace, and a finall concluſion of warre. In this manner, they followed him to the Kings lodgings, where Chirurgions came to viſit him, aſſuring him (vpon their liues) that in very few daies they would enable him to ſit on horſebacke, if he would be ordered by their aduice.
                  Now, in regard that all the Romaine knights lay ſlaine in the field, except Arquiſil, who was brought in as a priſoner: he entreated the knight of the greene Sword, to ſuffer him to depart thence vpon his faith, that he might carry home his dead companions, vpon condition, that he would return to him at all times, and as often as hee pleaſed to command him.
                  
                     Arquiſil (anſwered Amadis) you are a Gentleman, and I am perſwaded, that you will performe what you haue promiſed: goe, & returne hither againe ſo ſpeedily as you can. So departed Arquiſil, of whom our Hiſtory now ceaſſeth to ſpeake, to tell yee, that within ſome few dayes after, the knight of the green Sword, finding his hurts fully healed, and his body able to beare Armour, hee grew weary of longer tarrying with Tafinor, and finding him at conuenient leiſure, he ſpake vnto him in this manner.
                  Sir, thankes be to our Lord, you are now in peace, and out of all troubleſome annoyances; wherfore let my departure be with your good lyking: for I am determined to ſet forward to morrow morning, in purſuit of ſuch good fortune, as my faireſt ſtarres ſhall aſſigne vnto me. But thus Sir aſſure your ſelfe, that whereſoeuer I ſhall abide, ſo long as I liue I am your humble ſeruant, as the fauour and honour you haue done me, doth iuſtly binde me. How Sir knight (anſwered the King) will you leaue me? Are you weary of this Country, whereof you onely may diſpoſe, and of my ſelfe alſo. I beſeech you Sir, to accept it as your owne by due deſert, and let mee for euer bee happy by your companie.
                  Sir, (ſaid the knight) I humbly entreat you to pardon me, and to beleeue, that if it conſiſted in my power, (my earneſt deſire to doe you any ſeruice conſidered) I would yeeld to your requeſt; but my heart by no meanes can permit it. The King knowing that it was ſmall reaſon to detayne him againſt his will, ſaid. To morrow morning I will tell ye more; firſt, wee will heare Maſſe together, and then if it ſhall like you to graunt me one requeſt, which I am to demaund of ye, you ſhall therein do me a ſingular pleaſure. Sir (anſwered the knight) you haue ſuch power in command ouer me, as (
                        •
                     mine owne eſpeciall intention reſerued) I will not gaine-ſay whatſoeuer you ſhall vrge vnto me.
                  I thank ye Sir, (quoth the King.) So, falling into other diſcourſe, and night drawing on, the knight of the

greene Sword, commaunded Gandalin to make all things ready, for departing thence the next morning by breake of day. But as hee had a purpoſe to repoſe himſelf a while, the remembrance of his Princeſſe Oriana ouertook him in his priuate meditations, preſſing him with extraordinary paſſions, as he had no power to refraine from teares, ſpeaking thus to himſelfe. Alas ſweet friend, when ſhall I ſee the time, that I may once more be ſo happy, as to embrace you in mine armes? Loue, thou haſt lifted mee to the higheſt felicity, that euer loyall hart could attaine vnto. But how? looke how much my glory is vnmatchable in fauour, the like height it carrieth in tribulation and torment; for the more deſirous I am to ſee ye, the further of ſtill my cruell ſtarres doe ſend me. And that which is my greateſt hell of all, is a grounded feare, that my abſence ſhall either betray me to forgetfulneſſe, or bring you to the entertainment of a new loue.
                  Then ſuddenly he beganne to reprehend himſelfe, ſaying. Whence ſhould this idle opinion proceede in me? Deare ſweete, I haue found you ſo firme and conſtant, that I doe commit a ſinne in thinking amiſſe of you.
                  And ſuch is the aſſured proofe of your fidelitie, that the ſmalleſt ſiniſter doubt, is but mine owne ſhame. For well I know, that as my whole life is dedicated to your obedience, ſo you can neuer haue iuſt occaſion to wiſh me ill, or couet any vnkinde reuenge on me, except you take your ſelfe to be offended, in being more intirely and conſtantly affected by me, then any man elſe in the world can doe. And yet I cannot tell, whether Loue be deſirous to puniſh me, becauſe in diſdaining all other, I made my ſelfe ſo wholly yours, as many haue been by me neglected, and diſcourteouſly refuſed.
                  But well I wot, that my thoughts are ſo familiar in your heart, and your matchleſſe beauty ſo diuinely caractred and engrauen in myſoule, as I may aſſuredly reſolue, that time will ſet a period to all oppreſſions, either by my end, or your accuſtomed loyaltie.
                  Spending thus the night in ſighs and teares, euen vntill the morning appeared, he commaunded Gandalin to riſe, and being armed, hee went to Church, where he found the King at his deuotions. Hauing heard Maſſe, the King tooke him by the hand, and leading him ſomwhat aſide, ſaid.
                  My deareſt friend, ſeeing you ſtand reſolued to part from me, let me firſt tell yee, that ye haue a King and a kingdome wholly at your command, and heereof take knowledge whereſoeuer you ſhall come. Me thinkes you ſhould deferre no longer, to let me know of whence and what you are; promiſing you, vpon the faith and word of a King, that by me you ſhall not any way be diſcouered, except it may bee done with your conſent.
                  Sir (anſwered the knight;) let me entreate yee heerein not to wrong me, for I am minded neuer to diſcloſe my ſelfe to any one, except by force I ſhall be thereto compelled. Then you doe me a great diſpleaſure, quoth the King. God ſhield me replyed the knight, from offending ſo good and gracious a Prince: I will rather diſpenſe with my vow, and tell ye. Sir, I am that Amadis of Gaule, Sonne to King Perion, whoſe name you remembred, when you agreed to the Combate of twelue knights to twelue. By the

faith I beare to God, (ſaid the King) my heart did alwayes perſwade me ſo, and reſt your ſelfe aſſured, that this knowledge of you is more acceptable to me, then any thing elſe whatſoeuer in the world can bee. Bleſſed be the Father and Mother, that haue yeelded the world ſo worthy a man, by whom ſo many people haue receiued both profite and pleaſure.
                  Now was the King much more deſirous of his longer ſtay: but that Amadis moſt inſtantly vrged the contrary, whereto he durſt not make refuſall. Wherefore, mounting on horſebacke, by a goodly company he was conducted forth of the Citty, and there being commended to all good ſucceſſe: hee tooke his way towards Romania, ſeeking after ſtrange aduentures, as Fortune pleaſed to direct him.
               
               
                  CHAP. VIII.
                  
                     How King Liſuart hunting in the Forreſt, where hee had left the Ladies, accidentally met with a young Damoſell, who ſhewed him the way to the Hermitage, where the good Hermite Naſcian made his abyding: And how the infant (long time after) was knowne to bee the Sonne of Amadis and Oriana.
                     
                  
                  
                     IN the gay ſeaſon of Mayes flouriſhing moneth, King Liſuart hauing long ſoiourned in one place, was entreated by the Ladies, that hee would guide them forth on hunting: wherto he very willingly condiſcended, and preſently commaunded his huntſmen, to prepare their toyles in the next adioyning Forreſt, and to erect their Tents by the Fountaine of the ſeauen Beech trees, which was the moſt pleaſing place in all the wood, and beſt agreeing with the time. Not farre off thence was the Hermitage, where Naſcian the holy man nouriſhed Eſplandian, as already hath beene declared to yee.
                  It happened on the ſame day, when the King had left the Ladies in their Pauilions, hee ſo long purſued a Hart, ſore hunted and eſcaped from the toyles, that he was enforced to take vp into the higheſt of the Forreſt, all along the ſide of a great hill, very well couered with brakes and buſhes. So ſoone as he had attayned to the toppe there-of, on the other ſide he eſpied a young Gentleman deſcending haſtily, aged (as it might bee) about fiue or ſixe yeeres, leading a Lyonneſſe in a leaſhe; who ſeeing the Hart ſo hotly chaſed, hee let her looſe after him, and ſhee purſued with ſuch ſpeed, that ſhe tooke him downe before the King. The young youth, glad of ſo good ſucceſſe, ran a pace to the fall of the Deere, and another childe that was his companion, where ſeazing on the veneſon, hee tooke out a knife to cut his throate.
                  Then winding a horne very loud, two little Bratches, which ordinarily vſed to follow him, came preſently to him, and both they and the Lyonneſſe, had their fees of the game. This done, hee tooke and coupled them in a leaſhe; and hauing

done the like to the Lyonneſſe, croſſed again ouerthwart the wood.
                  The King, ſeeing them make haſte away from him, was very deſirous to know what they were, and comming forth of the place, where he had hid himſelfe, to note the behauiour of theſe children, called to the young Gentleman, who inſtantly ſtayed, vntill ſuch time as the King came to him, vſing theſe words. Prettie childe, I pray thee tell me what thou art, and where is thy dwelling.
                  Sir knight (anſwered the youth, Naſcian the Hermite hath hitherto nurſed me, and (as I thinke) is father both to me, and this my companion. This anſwere made the King very penſiue, for he could not comprehend in his thoughts, that Naſcian (being aged and decrepit, as alſo reputed for a man of moſt ſanctified life) ſhould or could haue a childe ſo young and goodly: wherefore, as one couetous of further information, hee demaunded where the Hermitage ſtood. It ſtands (quoth the youth) on the top of this Rocke, and ſhewing him a littly path, leſt him, ſaying. If it ſhall pleaſe yee to follow this tract, it will guide yee thither: for I muſt needs after my fellow to the Fountaine, where wee muſt dreſſe the veniſon, which wee haue gotten this morning.
                  Then the King left him, and aſcending vp the Rocke, eſpied on the height thereof, the poore dwelling of Naſcian, ſo enuironed with great buſhes, as well witneſſed the wonderfull ſolitude of the good Hermite. Alighting from his horſe, he entred into the firſt room, where hee found the holy man vpon his knees, clothed in a religious habit, and reading in a Booke of deuotion, which hee gaue not ouer at his arriuall: but hauing finiſhed his prayers, hee aroſe, demaunding of the King what he ſought for. Father, quoth he, not long ſince, as I croſſed the Forreſt, I met with a goodly childe, leading a Lyonneſſe in a leaſhe, I pray ye (for courteſies ſake) to tell me what he is: for, at the very firſt ſight of him, my minde gaue me, that he is iſſued from ſome good place.
                  While the King continued on this ſpeech, the Hermite ſo heedfully obſerued him, that hee knew him: as being the man to whom he had done many ſeruices, during the time that he followed Armes. In regard whereof, falling down humbly vpon his knees, hee craued pardon for his error, in not giuing him ſuch entertainment, as beſeemed ſo great a Maieſtie. But the King rayſing him vp, tooke him by the hand, ſaying. Good Father, will you not reſolue me concerning the young childe which I mentioned to ye? Aſſure your ſelfe (vpon my faith) that the knowledge you may giue me of him, cannot but redound to his great benefit. Sir, anſwered the Hermite, our Lord hath hitherto ſhewen great ſignes of loue to that childe; and ſeeing hee hath ſo carefully kept him, as I ſhall relate vnto ye, it ſtands with good reaſon, that you (as a King) ſhould loue & defend him in ſuch ſort, as no harme or diſpleaſure ſhould bee offered him.
                  You haue (as appeareth by your ſpeeches) an carneſt deſire to know what he is. In trueth Sir, during the time that I haue nouriſhed him, he may be tearmed mine: albeit, it is not yet fully ſixe yeares, ſince I tooke him from the teeth of a Lyonneſſe, that was carrying him to her whelpes. Wherein our Lord apparantly

declared, that hee is the preſeruer of all his creatures, becauſe the beaſt neuer did him harme, but onely ſuckled it among her yong ones, ſo that by the milke of her, and of a little Ewe, which then I had, I compaſſed the meanes of foſtring him for more then a moneth: In expectation ſtill of mine owne Siſter, Mother to the other yong Lad that keepes him companie, who afterward comming to me, ſhe became ſo good a Nurſe and Gouerneſſe to him, that (thankes be giuen to our Lord for it) I am perſwaded, he is one of the goodlieſt creatures this day liuing.
                  And one thing (more ſtrange then all the reſt) I am to tell yee: vnderſtand Sir, that as I was about to baptize him, my Siſter hauing taken off very rich clothes, wherein he was ſwadled, ſhee ſhewed me a letter vnder his right pappe as white as ſnow, contayning the word Eſplandian; and on the other ſide, (directly againſt his heart) were other carracters as redde as blood, which I could neuer vnderſtand, becauſe they are neither Latine, nor of our language. Now in regard of that name, which at his birth (it ſeemes) he brought with him into the world, I haue euer-more ſince, cauſed him to be called Eſplandian, accordingly.
                  In good faith Father, ſaide the King, you haue tolde me wonders: but ſeeing you found him in ſuch fort as you ſay, it is to be preſuppoſed verily, that he was borne not far off from this Countrie. That know not I, anſwered Naſcian, neither couet I to vnderſtand more, then what our Lord hath permitted. Well then, quoth the King, to morrow good Father, I pray you meete me at the Fountaine of the ſeauen Beeches, where I ſhall be with my Queene, and a goodly company of Ladies. Bring Eſplandian, the Lyonneſſe, and your young Nephew with you, to whom I intend ſome good, for his Father Sergils ſake, whom I ſomtime knew to be a good knight. Sir, replyed the holy man, I am bound to doe what you haue enioyned mee, and deſire of God, that all may be to his honour and glory.
                  The King giuing him the good morrow, rode thence, and arriued at his Tents about midday. Now, becauſe none there knew what was become of him, each man was diligent in enquiry after him: and (although his moſt intimate familiars deſired to know where hee had bin, yet would he reueale nothing, but commaunded to couer for dinner. As he was ready to ſit downe at the Table, Grumedan came to tell him, that the Queene entreated him to ſee her Tent before dinner, about ſome nouell occurrences lately happening. Whereupon hee went thence to her, and being alone by themſelues, ſhee told him, that as they came ryding from the Citty, a very beautifull Damoſell, mounted vpon a light ambling Hobbie, and conducted onely by a Dwarfe, preſented her ſelfe before her. And ſhe being very ſumptuous in her apparell, rode by all my Ladies, and women, (
                        •
                     quoth the Queene,) not vouchſafing one word to them, vntil ſuch time as ſhe came before mee: when ſhe gaue me this Letter, telling me, that you and I muſt reade it this day before dinner, becauſe thereby wee ſhould bee acquainted with admirable matters. And no ſooner had ſhee ſpoken that word, but ſhe rode away from me ſo faſt as her horſe could gallop, without permitting me the leaſt leyſure of any

anſwere. So ſhe gaue the King the Letter, ſealed with an Emerauld chaſed in golde, with theſe words engrauen about it; This is the Seale of Vrganda the vnknowne. Then opening the Letter, the King read the contents following.
                  
                     
                        The Letter of Vrganda the vnknowne to the mightie King Liſuart.
                        
                        
                           MOſt high and powerfull Prince, Vrganda the vnknowne, who loues and deſires to doe you any ſeruice, doth aduiſe and councell you to your great benefit: that at ſuch time as a Gentleman (nouriſhea by three diuers Nurſes) ſhall appeare before your Maieſtie; you would embrace, entertaine, loue and dearely reſpect him; for he is the cauſe of your quiet, by deliuering you from the greateſt danger wherein euer you were. He is deriued from blood royall on both ſides, and partaketh (ſomewhat) in the natures of thoſe creatures that gaue him ſucke. By the firſt of them, he ſhall be ſo ſtrong and magnanimous, as hee will darken all the valour of the very beſt Knights that haue gone before: being (neuertheleſſe) ſo milde and gentle, that hee will be loued and eſteemed of all men, occaſioned by the nouriſhment receiued from his ſecond Nurſe. As for the third, beleeue it Sir, that neuer was Gentleman of better ſpirit, more Catholique, and compleate in all good conditions: ſo that he ſhall addict himſelf to actions pleaſing to God, auoyding all vaine affaires, wherein the moſt of other Knights doe commonly ſpend their time. And that which exceedeth all the reſt; he will prooue the onely cauſe, of planting immortall peace betweene you, Amadis, and all his Linage. Therefore good King accept my counſell, and you wall finde it for the beſt.
                        
                        
                           Yours in all ſeruices, Vrganda the vnknowne.
                        
                     
                  
                  Theſe newes droue the King to no little admiration, and but for the high eſteeme hee made of Vrganda the vnknowen, he ſhould haue giuen ſlender credite thereto. But preſently he called to minde, that this might be the childe which he found with the Lyonneſſe: wherevpon he ſayd to the Queene; I dare aſſure ye Madam, that this day I haue ſpoken with him, of whom Vrganda writes vnto vs: and to morrow he will be heere with the good Hermit Naſcian, who hath reuealed ſtrange matters to me.
                  Then he reported, in what manner he met him, and all that he had heard of the Hermit: whereof the good Queene was not a little ioyfull, as well becauſe ſhee ſhould ſee the childe; as to haue ſome conference with the holy man, in caſes of Conſcience, and to be confeſſed by him. Neuertheleſſe Madame, (quoth the King) I deſire that you would not diſcloſe this to any one, vntill ſuch time as hee bee in our preſence.
                  Afterward, they went and ſate downe to dinner, talking of nothing all that while, but what goodly Harts and Hindes they had ſeene in the Forreſt. Then came Galaor and Norandell with their veniſon, perſwading the King to be earely ſturring the next morning: for they had fayled in the purſuit of a wilde Boare, the moſt huge and ſtrangeſt that euer they had ſeene. But hee made them anſwere, that he had receiued certaine letters from Vrganda, which he would impart to them the day following, and prayed them

therfore in the meane ſpace to cheriſh well the Houndes, till all were perfourmed as he had determined. Then riſing from the Table, the King went and conuerſed with the Ladies, ſo ſpending all the reſt of the day, vntill the houre of repoſe approached, when each one with-drew to their lodgings: and on the next morning, hauing heard Maſſe, each ſaluted other with the good morrow.
                  The day beganne to grow on apace, and the weather was ſo extraordinary warme, that the Queene commaunded the ſides of her tents to bee turned vp, for better receiuing the freſh coole ayre. Then could ſhe diſcerne a goodly company of Ladies, flocking together beneath the toyles; in whoſe preſence the King being arriued (the Ladies and knights conferring on what they beſt affected) he drewe Vrgandaes Letter forth of his ſleeue, which hee had receiued the day before, thus ſpeaking to Galaor and the reſt. Now will I ſhew you an aduertiſement, that was ſent vnto mee yeſterday, whereat (I thinke) you will no leſſe wonder, then I my ſelfe already haue done. Then he read it out ſo loud among them, that euery one might eaſily heare it. Neuertheleſſe, they could not preſume what this happy childe ſhould bee, to whom deſtiny had promiſed ſuch gracious bleſſings: onely the Princeſſe Oriana excepted, whom it touched neerer then any of the reſt, not hauing (in ſo long time) heard of her loſt Sonne. This was a notice to raiſe ſuſpition in her, that this might be her child; wherupon, ſuch an biguous perſwaſions ouer-tooke her thoughts, that aboue ten times ſhe changed colour: yet vndiſcerned of any there preſent; for they were all attentiue to the Letters reading, as alſo to the Kings ſpeeches, who demanded of Galaor, to know his opinion.
                  Sir, (ſaid he) ſeeing that Vrganda hath ſent it to yee, we may well beleeue that it will fall out ſo, conſidering the trueth of thoſe things, which ſo many times heeretofore ſhe hath foretold, and no doubt but God will ſo permit it; for it wold be the greateſt to mee, that euer can happen in all my life-time, to 
                        〈…〉
                      faire a peace betweene you, my Lord Amadis, and all the reſt of 
                        〈◊〉
                      friends and kindred. Welcome be it, (quoth the King,) and as the will of our Lord is, ſo let all bee done. As he ended theſe words, afarre off he eſpied the good Hermite comming, the two young Laddes Eſplandian and Sergil, with two vanaſſours, kinſemen to olde Naſcian, in ſuch order as I ſhall deſcribe vnto ye. Eſplandian had a great Hare, and two Partridges hanging on his ſhoulder, which he had 
                        •…
                     in with his Bowe by the way as hee came. Sergil led the Lyonneſſe in a leaſhe, faſtened with a little cord, and theſe followed Naſcian, and the two other: the one of them carrying the Hart, which the Lyonneſſe had kilde the day before; as formerly hath bin related, and the other ledde the two Braches (belonging to Eſplandian) coupled together.
                  When the Ladies ſaw the Lyonneſſe ſo ſlenderly guarded, they were ſo afraid, that they came all & ſate about the king: who for their more aſſurance, ſaid. Let none be diſmayed; for he that is maiſter ouer this Lyonnes in power, will defend vs from a more daungerous beaſt then this is. I know not, ſaid Galaor, who hath moſt commaund ouer the beaſt: but if ſhee once waxe diſpleaſed, the Huntſman

that leades her, will finde thoſe reines ouer weake, to rule and controule her at his pleaſure. Why, (quoth the King,) ſhe is in the conduct of the holy man Naſcian, therfore boldly let vs goe meete him. So each one aroſe, and the King went and embraced the Hermite, ſaying, hee was moſt heartily wel-come. Then taking the olde man by the one hand, and Eſplandian by the other, hee preſented them both to the Queene. Beholde Madame, the very goodlieſt Gentleman that euer you ſaw. Then Eſplandian (e
                     
                        •…
                      as faire forwardneſſe, as if all 
                        〈◊〉
                      life-time he had bin brought vp in the Court) made her a very grac
                        •…
                     s reuerence, and preſenting her his owne carriage, ſaid. See heere Madame, what hunting ſport wee haue had by the way, which you may diſpoſe as beſt you pleaſe. Pretty youth, ſaid the King, that power remaines in you onely. No Sir, anſwered Eſplandian, rather in you, or this Lady, to whom I haue already giuen it. Nay, quoth the King, ſhe had much rather, that you wold diuide it among her Ladies, according to your owne vnderſtanding; then, if any remaine, we will expect our part.
                  As the King ſpake theſe wordes, the Hermite caſt his eye vpon the childe; who fearing that hee had committed ſome errour in his talking, bluſhed ſo ſweetly, that very pleaſingly it became him to behold, and pointing to the Hart, c
                        •

                        ••
                     ng pardon of the King for his offence, ſaid. My Lord, I humbly beſeech you, to accept this Hart as your owne, and my Lady ſhall haue this Hare: but theſe Partridges are for the tother Lady ſtanding by her. This hee ſpake of Oriana his Mother, who darted ſuch a louing look at him, as is eaſier for you to imagine, then me to vtter. How pretty Sir? ſaid the King, will you giue nothing to theſe Gentlemen? I haue no more to giue, replyed the childe, but if I come hither againe tomorrow, I will bring them thus, ſuch as I can get: in the mean while if you be ſo pleaſed, you may let them bee partakers of your veniſon.
                  All this young diſcourſe was deliuered with ſo good a grace, and ſuch pleaſing life of geſture by Eſplandian, that it procured much loue and admiration enterchanged with ſmiles and amiable regardes. In good ſadneſſe, ſaid the King, his gentle nature is not to be wondered at: for, by that which hath bin declared to me, by him who hitherto was his foſter-father, faire deſtiny hath made large promiſes to him. Therefore good Father quoth he to Naſcian, to the end that euery one heere preſent, may vnderſtand the trueth of his rare fortune: I pray you once more to diſcourſe, that wherewith you acquainted me yeſterday. Sir, anſwered the Hermite, it is now more then fiue years, ſince I found the childe in the mouth of this Lyonneſſe, carrying it to her young ones newly whelpt: and I am verily perſwaded, that hee was not then fully a naturall day old. Then hee declared the manner of his ſwadling clothes; what countenance the Lyonneſſe expreſſed, when ſhe firſt gaue him ſucke, and the care hee had all the while of his thus nouriſhing, in expectation of his Siſters comming.
                  All this diſcourſe was diligently liſtened vnto by Oriana, Mabtla, and the Damoſell of Denmarke, well knowing (by the Hermites relation) that Elplandian was (vndoubtedly) the Son to Amadis & the Princeſſe; which cauſed ſuch

pleaſing contentment in them all, that they knew not well how to diſſemble it. Old Father, (quoth the King to the Hermite) you told me yeſterday, that ſeeing our Lord had hitherto ſo graciouſly preſerued the childe, I ought to haue care of him in his following-dayes: wherefore, if it like you to leaue him with me, and his young companion likewiſe, I will cauſe them to bee ſo commendably educated, that (if God be ſo pleaſed) they ſhall both proue worthy men, & good knights; and I deſire that I may preuaile with you in this requeſt. Sir (anſwered the Hermite) they are yours, ſeeing you are ſo deſirous to haue them: and I will heartily pray vnto our Lord God, to endue them with ſuch grace, as they may hereafter do you ſome acceptable ſeruice.
                  Then he gaue them his bleſſing, with theſe words. My Sonnes, ſeeing the King hath done ye ſo much honour, to allow yee entertainment in his Court, take paines to be obedient and pleaſing to him. The good olde man ſhed teares in great abundance, during the time of this ſhort ſweete counſell: when the King ſaid vnto him: Graue Father, make no doubt but I wil ſo gouerne them, that they ſhall become ſuch men as I haue promiſed ye. Then I beſeech ye Sir, (ſaid the Queene to the King) that you would referre them to my direction, till they bee more fitting for your ſeruice: and your Daughter ſhall haue Eſplandian, and my ſelfe will haue care of Sergil. Bee it as you pleaſe Madame (anſwered the King) I commit them both to your diſpoſition.
                  Thus the childe was deliuered into his owne mothers gouerning, who accepted him more gladly, then any gift in the world that elſe could haue beene giuen her: and long time hee continued with her, vnknowen to any, but thoſe Ladies that were beſt acquainted with her moſt priuate occaſions. Now, before Naſcian departed thence, ſhe would needes be confeſſed by him: wherupon (vnder ſhrift) ſhe gaue him to vnderſtand, that Eſplandian was ſonne to her and Amadis, and in what manner hee was loſt, by his carriage to nurſe. Beleeue mee Daughter (anſwered the Hermite) our Lord muſt needes be offended with you, in offering ſuch iniury to your owne ſoule, thorow an inordinate and volupruous deſire: eſpecially you being borne of ſo great parents, and ought to be a mi
                        •…
                      and example to all the other people, aboue whom it hath pleaſed him to aduance yee. Deare Father, (quoth ſhe,) I know wel, that I haue moſt grieuouſly ſinned: notwithſtanding, that which I haue done, was as a woman to her husband; for at the inſtant, we affianced our ſouls mutually together. Heereupon ſhe reported how Archalaus had led her away, and how ſhee was after ſuccoured by Amadis, according as already hath beene related, in the precedent Hiſtory.
                  Then the Hermit was reaſonably well ſatisfied, accounting the offence ſo much the leſſe, being vndergone with ſo good a condition: for after this confeſsion, the effect followed, becauſe by this meanes, (though ſome long while before) Naſcian made peace with the King and Amadis, being on the very point of entring into a ſharpe and cruell battaile, as you ſhall vnderſtand more at large in the fourth Book following. But Oriana hauing done pennance, according as Naſcian had appointed her: he tooke leaue of the King and the whole Court, to returne home to his

Hermitage, taking the Lyonneſſe along with him, and the King went back to the Citty, to take order there for his further affaires.
               
               
                  CHAP. IX.
                  
                     How the knight of the greene Sword, being departed from King Tafinor of Bohemia, came into the marches of Romania, where hee met with Graſinda in the fieldes, accompanied with many Gentle-men, Ladies and Damoſels: Eſpecially with a Knight named Brandaſi dell, who would compell him (by force of Armes) to come ſpeake with the Ladie Graſinda, and of the Combate they fought together.
                  
                  
                     YOu haue heeretofore heard how the knight of the greene Sword, departing from King Tafinor, tooke his way towardes the parts of Romania, where hee made his abode no long time, but had perfourmed ſo many worthy deedes of Armes, that euery Prouince was filde with his praiſes. But it was not without mighty ſufferance of melancholy, by continuall thinking on his Princeſſe Oriana. It happened vpon one day among others, that croſſing the Country, hee ariued at a Port or Hauen of the Sea, whereupon was planted a Towne, in the moſt pleaſing manner of ſituation that euer hee had ſeene, it being called Sar

                  And becauſe the houres of the day were not ſufficiently ſpent, he would not (as yet) make entrance: but turned his courſe on euery ſide, to make the better diſcouery at his owne beſt aduantage; where obſeruing the Sea coaſte, hee beganne to remember Gaule, from whence it was now aboue two yeares, ſince he parted; which proued ſuch an encreaſing of his 
                        ••
                     rrowes, that the

                     res trickled downe his cheekes amaine.
                  As hee continued in this penſiue humour, he eſpyed a troupe of knights, Ladies and Gentle-women comming towardes him: among whom there was one more beautifull and goodly, (as it ſeemed to him) then any of the reſt: for ouer her head was borne a Canopie of white taffata, faſtened to foure roddes of yron, to keepe her from the heate of the Sun, which was then very piercing and violent.
                  But becauſe hee tooke no delight at that time, to bee ſeene in ſuch companie, being ſo deuoutly addicted to ſolitude: he kept off ſo farre as hee could from all reſort, that hee might (with better diſpoſition) thinke on the former fauours he had receiued in Great Britaine.
                  
                  Beholding this troupe to draw neerer and neerer, hee wandred aloofe off: yet was he not ſtrayed ſo

                     re; but hee perceiued a comely Damoſell comming after him, accompanied with a knight, that held a great Launce in his hand, which he ſhaked ſo rudely, as if hee intended to breake it. The Damoſell being hard at hand, made her palfray get before him, leauing

the other knight her guide, behind, vſing theſe words to the knight of the Dwarfe. Sir knight, yonder Lady, whom I imagine you haue taken little note of, hath ſent me to yee, deſiring that you would come ſpeake with her, for your owne good.
                  God defend her from al harmes, (replyed our ſad knight,) albeit I haue no further knowledge of her. But tell me Lady I pray yee, what would this knight haue that came hither with you? Sir, (quoth ſhe) let him no way procure your diſtaſte: onely doe what I haue deſired, and well will come of it. Aſſuredly, (ſaid he) if you will not tell me, I ſhall faile in fulfilling what you would haue. Seeing you are ſo earneſt Sir, (quoih ſhee) you ſhal be ſatisfied, although it is much againſt my minde. Vnderſtand then Sir, that when my Lady had eſpyed you, and this Dwarfe attending on you; becauſe it hath beene told her, that there was a ſtraunge knight in this Country, who performed ſuch actions of Armes, as no man poſſibly can doe more, and goes alwaies accompanied as now you are: ſhee is halfe perſwaded that you are the man. In which reſpect, ſhe would gladly doe you all honorable ſeruices ſhe can deuiſe, and diſcouer an eſpeciall ſecret to ye, which (as yet) ſhe hath not reuealed to any perſon liuing.
                  Now Sir, as concerning this knight, when hee heard my Ladies motion, he made her anſwere, that he would cauſe you to come to her by force or faire meanes, which is very eaſie for him to doe, in regard of the high chiualry remaining in him; for his equal is not to be found in all theſe Countries: wherefore I would counſell you to credit me, & goe along with me.
                  Friendly Damoſell, anſwered Amadis, I would gladly doe more for your Miſtreſſe then this: but I muſt firſt trye, whether this knight can accompliſh his promiſe, or no. By my faith Sir, quoth ſhe, I am the more ſorry for ye; becauſe, ſo farre as my weake iudgment can reache, you appeare to bee a moſt courteous knight. So ſhe turned her palfray, and the knight of the dwarfe followed on his way, as before hee had done.
                  When the other knight ſaw that, he cryed out ſo loud as hee could. Cowardly and faint-harted knight, alight from thy horſe, and lead him backward, vſing his taile in ſtead of a bridle. Then come ſo, and preſent thy ſelfe to my Lady, humbly crauing her mercy, becauſe thou didſt not follow her Damoſell; otherwiſe, I ſhall ſmite off thy head from thy ſhoulders; therefore make choice of theſe two offers, which thou doeſt imagine moſt honourable for thee.
                  Beleeue me Sir, anſwered the knight of the Dwarſe, ſuch ſeruice is better beſeeming you, then mee; fall to it therefore, when you pleaſe. Is it euen ſo Sir? (ſaid the other;) then Ile make yee doe it, whether you will or no. So placing his Launce in his reſt, hee made no doubt of foyling him, as hee had done many before. Neuertheleſſe, our knight of the dwarfe, omitting not the leaſt moment of readineſſe to receiue him, gaue the ſpurs to his horſe, and met the other (who was named Brandaſidel) ſo full in the carriere, that he caſt him quite out of his ſaddle, and hee lay in a trance vpon the ground; but him-ſelfe was hurt a little in the throate, and finiſhing his courſe, he turned bridle againe for a freſh encounter.
                  
                     
When hee ſaw Brandaſidel lye ſo long vpon the earth, he ſaid to Gandalin. Alight, and looke if he bee dead or not, and take from him his Shield and Helmet. So Gandalin came to him; and as hee was diſarming him, Brandaſidel recouered from his traunce; whereupon the knight of the Dwarfe called to him, ſaying. Villaine, thou art dead, except thou performe that which thou wouldſt haue compelled mee to done, a man vtterly vnknowen to thee: for, ſeeing thy ſelfe wouldſt make ſuch a Law, it is conuenient that thou ſhouldſt keepeit. As Brand
                           •…
                        l opened his eyes, hee behelde the knight of the Dwarfe, holding his drawen weapon againſt his throate, looking ſtedfaſtly on him, and not vttering one word. How? quoth our knight, haſt thou not the heart to ſpeake? By the faith I beare to God, thy head then ſhall giue me a better reaſon. So diſmounting from his horſe, and lifting vp his Sword to ſtrike; Brandaſidel cryed vnto him. Hold your hand Sir knight, for I will accompliſh your command, rather then dye in this vile maner. Riſe then, replyed the knight of the Dwarfe, and let mee haue it done immediatly. Then Brandaſidel aroſe, and called his Squires to helpe him vp on horſe-backe, according as the knight of the Dwarfe had appointed him, ſitting with his face backward, and holding his horſe taile in ſteed of a bridle, turning his Shield alſo the in ſide outward. In this maner rode he to Graſinda, who ſeeing him come ſo honourably, could not refraine from laughing, not any in her company, to ſee him thus worthily corrected with his owne rodde. In which regard he was ſo aſhamed of himſelfe, that he du
                        •…
                      not look vp; but holding down his head like a micher, rode thence away into the Towne.
                  Now, the Damoſell that was ſent from this Lady to our knight of the Dwarfe, heard the wordes which paſſed betweene the two knights, and obſerued the manner of their encounter, whereof as ſhee was making report to her Miſtreſſe, the knight of the Dwarfe came thither, where humbly ſaluting Graſinda, he thus ſpake.
                  Madame, by that which one of your women told mee, you haue a deſire to ſpeake with mee. Indeed Sir knight, (quoth ſhee) ſhee told you nothing but trueth; and ſeeing it hath pleaſed you to doe mee ſo much honour, you are moſt reſpectiuely welcome. For, ouer and beſide thoſe miracles of manhood, which I haue heard (for trueth) performed by you in theſe our marches: I was made acquainted (not long ſince) with the extraordinarie fauour, which King Tafinor of Bohemia (my Couſin) receiued by your meanes. In which reſpect, I muſt confeſſe my ſelfe to ſtand obliged to you, and doe therefore entreate you (ſo farre as my poore power may preuaile with you) to accept a lodging in my Palace, where your hurt may bee diligently attended: thus aſſuring your ſelfe, that to no place you can be better welcome, nor receiue ſpeedier cure. Madame, (ſaid he) perceiuing in what kinde manner you haue entreated me, let me perſwade you to reſt reſolued, that I will make no ſpare of my ſelfe in all perils of the world, to doe you any ſeruice: and therefore, reaſon ſtrictly bindeth me, not to refuſe your moſt gracious offer, mine owne neceſſity ſo much requiring it.
                  Thus rode they on towardes the Towne, conferring very kindly together:

and Graſinda ſeeing him to be ſo goodly and compleate a perſon, inſtantly fell into amorous affection. And let me tell ye, ſhee was a Lady of moſt exquiſite beauty, young, delicate, well-ſpoken, affable, in the gayetic of her time, worthy of the chiefeſt liking, as any Lady elſe could be, hauing liued in marriage not fully a yeare, being now a widow, and without any childe. But the knight of the Dwarfe had his thoughts elſe-where buſied, the Idea of his Oriana being continually before his eyes, by whoſe abſence he endured extreame paſſions: and yet notwithſtanding, he knew ſo well how to conceale them, as the cunningſt eye could hardly make any diſcouery.
                  As they entred into the Towne, the inhabitants (who had already heard of the ſucceſſe betweene him and Brandaſidel, who before had bin reputed the tougheſt knight in all that Countrie,) thronged thorow the ſtreetes to ſee him, ſaying to one another as hee paſſed along: This were a happy fortune to our Lady, if ſhee might haue this man to bee her husband; for a more goodly perſon is no where to bee found, nor of greater valour. Being come to the Palace, and conducted into a very ſumptuous Chamber, he was there vnarmed.
                  Then came Maiſter Eliſabet, a very excellent Chirurgion, who hauing ſeene the wound which he had receiued in his throate, ſaide vnto him. Sir, you are wounded in a very dangerous place, and haue need of long reſt: otherwiſe, your perſon will be in great hazard. Very ſorry was our knight to heare theſe words, and ſaid to Maiſter Eliſabet. I will doe whatſoeuer you will haue me, prouided, that you promiſe me, (vpon your faith to God, and your Miſtreſſe,) that ſo ſoone as you ſhal ſee me in diſpoſition, to endure trauaile, you will not faile to tell mee, becauſe whatſoeuer I doe, it is impoſſible for me to reſt in any quietnes, vntill it pleaſe our Lord to permit, that I may bee where my heart deſireth to ſoiourne. Thus ſpeaking, he fell into ſuch a melancholy fitte, as teares iſſued abundantly out of his eyes, whereof he was much aſhamed: neuertheleſſe, reſtrayning them ſo couertly as he could, hee ſhewed a more chearefull countenance then before. And Maiſter Eliſabet ſaid vnto him: I pray you Sir, vſe as little ſadneſſe as poſſibly you may, and I truſt in God, in very ſhort while to ſee you ſafely cured.
                  Then were the Tables commanded to be couered, and Graſinda her ſelfe ſerued in perſon, perſwading him very earneſtly to be merry: and ſupper being ended, they betooke themſelues ſeuerally to reſt; but in ſteed of ſleeping, he (according to his wonted manner) beganne to remember his Oriana, in whom was his ſole delight and pleaſure, entermixing (notwithſtanding) thoſe cogitations with extreame torments and paſſions, which combatted continually one againſt another, ſo that in the midſt of this trauaile, at length he fell aſleepe. But if loue preuayled ſo powerfully in him, hee was of no leſſe might in our new Loue Graſinda, who being with-drawen into her Chamber, ſoone after, betooke her ſelfe to bed: when (ſuddenly) the comely graces and feature of our knight of the greene Sword, in liuely conceit preſented themſelues before her, which helde ſo ſtrict a commaund ouer her affections, as ſhe had no ability to contradict thoſe impreſsions, ſo that

ſhe fell to this conference with her ſelfe.
                  Alas, whence ſhould proceede this ydle fancie? The death of my late husband, did ſo farre eſtraunge mee from this behauiour, as I haue many times ſolemnely purpoſed, neuer more to come in ſubiection to any man liuing. Neuertheleſſe, this newe come ſtranger who perhaps, makes no account of me

                  Now, as ſhe purpoſed to diſcloſe her hearts oppreſsions, feare and ſhame, inter-mixed with that modeſt baſhfulneſſe, which euermore held ſoueraigne dominion ouer her, had ſo cloſely lockt vp her lips, that ſhe ſate vnable to make him any anſwere. But ſhe ſent him ſuch a heart-ſpeaking looke, as made her

                     re complexion to alter; which our knight of the Dwarfe wel obſerued, but imagining this weakeneſſe to proceed from ſome other occaſion, he thus ſpake. Madame, ſeeing your diſpoſition hath bin ſo diſpleaſing to yee, me thinkes I ſhould not miſcounſell yee, to goe and lye downe againe, and ſleep may come vpon ye better, then before. Let me tell ye Sir (anſwered Graſinda,) this diſeaſe is too frequent with me, and will paſſe away (by Gods leaue) as ſudd
                        •…
                     ly, as he ſent it.
                  She ſpake this, to preuent all occaſion of leauing his company, wherein ſhee ſpent the whole day, taking ſuch delight in looking on him, as ſhee had almoſt forgot her ſelfe, that it was now a due houre to command her abſence. Wherefore, giuing him the good night, ſhe returned to her bed, where, if the precedent night ſhee tooke little reſt, this that enſued, was much more iniurious to her, becauſe inceſſantly ſhe turned from one ſide to another, by reaſon of this fiery loue torment in her. So that, ſetting aſide all other cares, ſhe concluded (without any further delaying) the very next morning, to let the knight vnderſtand her martyrdome. And

queſtionleſſe, had he not bin wounded, ſo violent was her extreamity; that inſtantly ſhee would haue gone to his bed. For, thoſe delights and ſolaces, which (for leſſe then a yeares ſpace) ſhee had with her late husband, added freſh fuell to her flame, and was as tinder to her oppreſſing paſſions: which at length ſo ouer wearied her, as ſhee fell aſleepe, and ſo continued till it was broad day.
                  Being vp and ready; according to her vſuall cuſtome, ſhee went to ſee how her knight did, more fearefull then euer before 
                        •
                     ſhee had bin; and whereas in her night fittes, ſhee had reſolued to acquaint him with her diſquiet, Day had put her on ſuch a Robe of ſhame, as quite altered her determination. Thus for more then a moneths ſpace ſhee continued in theſe agonies, till one day among other, meeting with Gandalin at apt leyſure, ſhe thus beſpake him.
                  Friendly Squire, in the loue that you beare to God & your Maiſter, let me entreate to mooue one queſtion to ye, concerning him, which cannot but returne to his great honour and profit, and by mee ſhall not bee diſcouered to any liuing. Madame (quoth Gandalin) if your motion be within the compaſſe of my capacity, aſſure your ſelfe that I will reſolue ye. Tell me then, ſweet Friend, (ſaid Graſinda,) doe you know of his affection to any woman, that may contradict his loue to another, if it ſhould grow to ſuch a purpoſe? Madame (quoth he) it is but a little while as yet, ſince the Dwaife and I became his ſeruants; whereto nothing more incited vs, then his admired vertues and renowne: And he hath expreſſely forbid vs, to enquire either of his name, or any of his affaires: but to declare the fidelitie of our duty, in knowing no more then he thinkes fit for vs. But thus much I dare tell yee, that wee haue already ſeene ſuch valour in him, as you may well credit without all queſtion, that he is the beſt knight in the world.
                  Now, as Gandalin made a more ample relation of his Maiſters fortunes, ſhe held her eyes fixed on the ground, and (in ſighing) ſhewed her ſelfe ſo penſiue, that hee eaſily perceiued the loue ſhee bare to his Lord. But tell me then Sir, I pray ye, (quoth ſhe,) why did hee fall aweeping the other day in our preſence. Truely Madame, ſaid he, it is a matter continually happening to him, and ſo often doth hee ſighe both by day and night, that I maruaile much how he can liue. Yet I know him to be ſuch a man, and of ſo great ſpirit, that this proceedeth not from any dread of peril, or from any hazardous enterpriſe he can vndertake: whereby it may bee eaſily preſumed, that it is entire loue and affection, which he beareth to ſome Lady that I know not. So God help me, (replyed Graſinda) I do beleeue as much, and highly thanke yee for this courteſie. Now, you may go to him, when you pleaſe, and heauen ſend him as ſpeedie a remedie for his hurts, as I could willingly wiſh to mine.
                  Hauing thus ſpoken, ſhee with-drew thence into her Chamber, perſwading her ſelfe aſſuredly, that ſhe was preuented in her hopes: where-upon, ſhe promiſed by all diſcreete meanes, to quenche the fire already too much kindled. Neuertheleſſe, Loue ſtill gaue a maine oppoſition, and fed her imaginations with idle conceit, that (in time) ſhee ſhould hit the marke ſhe aymed at. But it fell out otherwiſe; for ſo ſoone as our knight felt himſelfe able for

Armes, he commaunded Gandalin to make all things ready, becauſe he meant to ride away the next morning.
                  At that very inſtant Graſinda came into his Chamber, where talking together as they were wont to doe, and falling from one diſcourſe to another, the knight of the Dwarſe at laſt ſpake thus. Madame, I feele my ſelfe ſo exceedingly well recouered (thankes be to God and you) as I am purpoſed, ſo you bee not therewith diſpleaſed, to part from hence very earely to morrow morning: coueting nothing more in my defi
                        •
                     es, then to ſtudy how I may (during my life-time) beſt acknowledge the good and honor you haue done me. Therefore Madame, I moſt humbly entreate you, to conſider with your ſelfe, if there be any ſeruice that you ſhal pleaſe to command me, my imployment therein ſhall ſtretch ſo farre as my lifes extreamity.
                  When Graſinda heard theſe wordes, ſhe fell into ſuch a heauineſſe, as ſhe could not returne him any anſwere: neuertheleſſe, at length ſhe thus replyed. Knight of the greene Sword, I make no doubt, but that your heart and tongue are relatiues, the one agreeing with the others intention, as well for the good which you ſay, you haue receiued in my houſe, as for a matter of farre higher moment, which neither the time, nor your forward intent, will now permit to be diſcouered.
                  Therfore, when the happy houre ſhall come beſt fitting mee to vrge my recompence, aſſure your ſelfe, I will demaund it ſo ſecretly of you, (without either bluſhing, feare or ſhame) as you ſhall well perceiue it to be a matter, which I haue hitherto kept concealed in my heart, and neuer reuealed to any one liuing. In the meane while, let me entreate you to tell me, which way you purpoſe to direct your trauaile? Beleeue me Madame, anſwered our knight, I hope in ſhort time to bee in Greece, as well to ſee the country, as the Emperour, of whom I haue heard many good reports.
                  Truely Sir, (replyed Graſinda,) I wiſhe all happy ſucceſſe to attend yee; and I meane to prouide a Ship for ye, and to furniſh ye in ſuch ſort, as your voyage ſhall be the eaſier perfourmed. Moreouer, I will giue ye Maiſter Eliſabet for your health and welfare, when any diſaſter or inconuenience ſhall befall ye: with this promiſe, that if you finde your body apt and able, you ſhall come againe hither to mee within a yeares compaſſe. Our knight had ſmall reaſon to refuſe ſo great kindnes; but in returning Graſinda moſt harty thankes, ſaid. Madame, I were the moſt abiect wretch in the world, and no way worthy the name of knight, if I ſhould not endeauour to acknowledge ſo many gracious fauours, as you haue beſtowed vpon me; and I ſhould think the wearing of Armes farre vnfit for me, if either by dread of death, or any other accident whatſoeuer, I ſhould deferre the fulfilling of what you haue inioyned me. What I deſire (quoth ſhe) to haue you doe for me, ſhalbe reſpitted till your backe returne, and it is no other thing, but what ſhalbe for your honor and aduantage. Madame (ſaid he) ſuch is my confidence in your true appearing vertues, that you will not vſe me in any other ſeruice. No, vpon my faith, (quoth ſhe.)
                  Then ſhe ſent for Maiſter Eliſabet, to whom ſhe gaue charge for prouiding a good Ship in readines,

and all neceſſaries elſe fit for trauaile, during the knights voyage to Conſtantinople. Which he accompliſhed with ſuch care and diligence, as (the fift day following) our knight taking leaue of Graſinda, went aboord with Maiſter Eliſabet. Hoyſing their ſayles, they paſſed many Iſlands of Romania, in the more part whereof he performed ſuch rare deedes of proweſſe; that his fame flew (in ſhort while) through the whole Country. But by reaſon he had no more then a yeares limitation, for his returne to Graſinda, the Mariners importuned him to more ſpeedines: giuing him to vnderſtand, that it was impoſſible for him (making ſo many delayes by the way) to finiſh the voyage ſo ſoone: Whereupon he concluded, to land no more till he came into Greece; and therefore launched forth into the maine: where (for this time) wee will leaue him to ſpeake of matters happening in Great Brittaine, during the long voyage of Amadis.
                  
                  It hath bin tolde yee in the ſecond Booke, that Patin, being then no more then a meane knight, without any great eſtate or poſſeſſion, liued onely in hope; to bee heereafter Emperour of Rome, when the death of his brother happened, who had no procreated heire of his body. This perſwaſion, in reſpect of his loue to the Queene Sardamira, whom he moſt intirely affected, made him vndertake the voyage of Great Brittaine, where he was moſt honourably entertained by King Liſuart, eſpecially after he knew him to be the Emperors brother. There he grew forgetfull of his firſt loue, beholding the beauty and comely graces of the Princeſſe Oriana, whom he requeſted in mariage of the King her Father. Vpon the anſwere made him, he determined to ſhewe himſelfe among the moſt valiant ſpirits, in ſearche of ſtraunge aduentures, and combatting all errant knights he ſhould meet withall. Croſſing through the Forreſt, whereas then Amadis was, deſpairing of euer ſeeing his Oriana any more (in regard of his baniſhment, ſignified to him by Durin, brother to the Damoſell of Denmarke) he beganne to ſing the praiſes of the Princeſſe, and to glorifie himſelfe in the loue ſhe bare him in his opinion. At which time, Amadis and he fought together, where Patin was conquered, and ſore wounded in the head: in regard whereof, he returned to Rome, without going backe to King Liſuarts Court, leauing his marriage in ſuſpence till ſome other time.
                  But it fell out ſo well for him, that ſo ſoone as he was there arriued, the Emperour his brother left his life, leauing him ſole heire to the Empire. Whereupon, he had far greater deſire then before, to finiſh the affection he had begunne: hoping, by reaſon of the great dignity whereto he was now aduanced, he ſhould the more eaſily compaſſe his long-deſired marriage. Which, the ſooner to effect, he ſent Ambaſſadours to King Liſuart, with a new requeſt of his daughter in marriage: heereto were appointed Saluſte Quide, Prince of Calabria, Brondariel de Roce, the great Maiſter, the Archbiſhop of Tarente, and the Queene Sardamira, accompanied with a gallant troupe of knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen, to bring home the Princeſſe Oriana, as they hoped. But matters happened to another end, as heereafter more at large ſhall be related to you.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. X.
                  
                     How within ſome while after the Knight of the greene Sword had hoyſed ſaile into the maine Sea, and had quite left the Iſlands of Romania: By hard fortune, he was caſt vpon the Deuils Iſland, where he fought with a Monſter, named Endriagus.
                     
                  
                  
                     THe Mariners hauing ſet their ſayles, with full intent for Conſtantinople; ſo ſoone as they had loſt ſight of the Iſles of Romania, the Sea exalted it ſelfe in ſuch ſort, and grew to ſuch a dreadfull tempeſt, that, notwithſtanding all paines the Mariners could take, for beſt guiding and gouerning the Ship, it was ſo toſt with contrary windes and waues, as very many times they were in manifeſt peril of ſhipwrack. And being out of all further hope, ſafety not appearing ſo much as in a glimpſe of aſſurance: they attended onely the mercy of God, and continued in this extreamity the ſpace of 8, dayes, without knowing where, or in what part they were. For the tempeſt of winde, haile and raine, was ſo thick and continuall, as it ſeemed that heauen and earth and the Sea would meete together. But at length, the Ship was throwen on Shoare about two houres before day, and with ſuch violence, as they feared it would be ſplit; for it was driuen out of the Sea on drye land.
                  Notwithſtanding, they ſuſtayned no harme at all, which gaue them better hope then formerly they had, ſo that when bright day appeared, they knew themſelues to bee in the deuils Iſland, which by reaſon of a ſtraunge Monſter there abyding, was ſo diſpeopled, as no liuing creature repayred thither. Then a new feare ſeazed on them, and now they deſpaired of their liues more then before, ſo that they were euen ready to throw them-ſelues into the deepe: when the knight of the greene Sword demanded of them, what might be the reaſon of this terror?
                  Alas Sir, (quoth they,) where doe you imagine wee are landed? what gulfe, what ſhipwrack could haue beene worſe to vs then this? Now wee are in compaſſe of the Deuils power, who in the forme of a cruell Monſter, ruinates all this Country. How? ſaid the knight, I ſee nothing yet that ſhould thus amaze ye: therefore tell me I pray ye, what deuill or Monſter is it, that workes this great deſpaire in ye?
                  Then Maiſter Eliſabet (leſſe diſmayed then any of the reſt) ſpake for them al, ſaying. Vnderſtand Sir, that this Iſland, wheron our diſaſter hath brought vs, was not long ſince in the poſſeſſion of a Giant, the moſt bloody Tyrant that liued in all the Iſles. he had to wife an honourable Lady, as wiſe, milde and vertuous, as hee was wicked and cruell: of whom he begot a daughter, named Brandaginda, that was (in her time) one of the goodlieſt Ladies in the world: And although many great Lords, and men of high merite, would gladly haue enioyed her in marriage: yet notwithſtanding, the rigour of the Giant was ſo extreme, as he ſtill kept them off, becauſe by no meanes hee would haue her to marry. In regard where-of, this Mayden encreaſing in yeares, and thoſe deſires that would faine experiment, what happineſſe it was to liue with a man,

knowing withall, that her father had ſet downe his reſolution, neuer to beſtow her as a wife on any man: preuailed ſo much by inſinuating blandiſhments, and inceſtuous demonſtrances, that ſhe drew him to affect her, and had his company carnally. But that which was much worſe, ſhee machinated the death of her owne mother, that the more boldly, and without feare, ſhe might liue ſtill in this horrid inceſt, wherto the Giant gaue quick conſent. This Mayde that was, perceiuing her ſelfe to grow great with childe: one day, as her mother and ſhee walked together in an Orchard, paſſing by a deepe Well, ſhe thruſt her therein ſo rudely, as ſhe brake her neck in the fall.
                  Now, becauſe the people began to murmure, the Giant told them, that he vnderſtood by three of his gods (one in the likeneſſe of a Griffon, the other as a Lyon, and the third in the ſhape of a man) that of him and his daughter, ſhould bee borne a creature, ſo much to be reſpected and feared through all the Countrie, that none of his neighbours ſhould dare to attempt any harme againſt him. And vnder this colour, he openly married his wicked daughter, who within no long time after, was deliuered of a Monſter, in ſuch manner as I ſhall ſhew vnto ye. It was ſo full of haire on the face, feete and hands, as it appeared to be a Beare, all the reſt of the body was couered ouer with ſcailes, ſo hard and ſtrong, as no arro
                        •…
                     ot from a Bow could pierce them▪ beſide, they were ſo broad & great, that they extended quite ouer the backe, defending it like ſo many Shields, ſo that no inſtrument of yron could enter thorow them. From vnder them came forth arms, hands, legs & feete, with nailes and clawes ſo piercing, like to them of a mighty ſtrong Lyon. His eyes ſeemed properly like two burning coales, or brands, ſo red and ſparkling, that in the night ſeaſon they ſeemed like two ſhining ſtarres. And, that which was much more, his teeth were ſo huge & ſharp, that they would bite through & breake the beſt made Armour of ſteele.
                  By all theſe meanes, he did ſo many harmes and miſchiefes, that he brought this Iſle to be diſinhabitable; eſpecially becauſe he could mount, leape and run ſo ſpeedily, as the very nimbleſt Hart in the world. And if at any time he grew angry or offended (as it happened very often) in fighting with Beares, Lyons and wilde Boares, he would ſend foorth ſuch a dreadfull ſmoake from his noſtrils, as plainly appeared to be a duskie flame of fire, ſo loathſomly ſtinking, as no liuing creature could eſcape infection therby, which cauſed euery one to flye & ſhunne him. When he yelled or howled, hemade ſuch a fearefull cry or noyſe, grating his teeth in ſo ſtrange manner, and clapping his wings ſo hideouſly; as, to the very boldeſt courage, nothing could be more dauntable. The people of this Sea, commonly called him Endriagus; as being held and reputed by them, to be rather a deuill, then any beaſt produced by nature.
                  Much amazed was our knight of the greene Sword, to heare Maiſter Eliſabet make this ſtrange deſcription; nor being able to comprehend any poſſibility, that ſo horrid a thing could be engendred betweene man & woman. Except the ponderous weight of a ſinne ſo monſtrous, had in ſuch ſort alienated naturall diſpoſition: that the ſoule fiend tooke the place of a reaſonable ſoule, and ſo cauſed this helliſh

procreation. Whereupon hee demaunded, why he was ſuffred to liue ſo long, and whether (as yet) he breathed there or no? I will tell yee Sir, anſwered Maſter Eliſabet, all ſuch as haue attempted his deſtruction, haue fayled and finiſhed theirliues moſt cruelly, Further-more, you muſt know, that the Emperour of Conſtantinople, vnder whoſe ſubiection this Iſland alwaies hath bin, hath ſent hither the greater part of his power, but all hath proued to no purpoſe. I maruaile, (ſaid our knight) why they did not kill him ſo ſoone as he was borne?
                  Vnderſtand Sir, (replyed Maiſter Eliſabet, that Brandaginda perceiuing her ſelf to be great with child, the Giant her Father was not a litle proud thereof, as hoping to haue ſuch iſſue as his gods had promiſed him. And heereupon, he cauſed three or foure Nurſes to be diligently ſought for; conceiuing with himſelfe, that ſeeing the infant ſhould be ſo ſtrong; reaſon required, that his nouriſhing ſhould be anſwerable thereto. But the mothers time of deliuering growing neere, ſhee began to feele the moſt bitter anguiſhes in the world. Notwithſtanding, the Giant and ſhee tooke all in good part, perſwading themſelues that thoſe paines proceeded onely from vigour of the childe: who at the time appointed) came ſo dreadfully forth of the mothers wombe, as all the women then preſent were amazed thereat. Neuertheleſſe, ſtanding in feare of the Giant, they ſwadled it vp in rich clothes, and gaue it to one of the Nurſes to ſucke: at whoſe breſt it drew ſo ſtrongly, and without any intermiſſion, as, notwitſtanding all her loud cryes, he ſucked the very heart blood out of her body, ſo that ſhee fell downe dead on the floore. The like did the ſecond, & the third, all of the Nurſes inſtantly dying, not only by the poyſon iſſuing frō him, but alſo by the violence he did vnto them. Theſe tydings being ſent to the Giant, in no little amazement, he went to his gods, and hauing offered ſacrifice according to his cuſtome, he demaunded of them, why they had giuen him ſuch a monſtrous linage? He that carried the reſemblance of a man, anſwered. It is neceſſary he ſhould be ſuch a one, that as my workes are ſtraunge and admirable, ſo ſhould his be, & conformable to mine, eſpecially to deſtroy all Chriſtians: therefore hee hath ſome ſemblance of a man, to whom all things owe obedience. And I, (quoth the other) in fauour of thee, haue giuen him the ſtrēgth of a Lyon to reſemble mee therein. That which mooued me, ſaid the third, to arme him with wings, and ſharpe-piercing tallents or clawes, was in imitation of my ſelfe, that as I partake in a Griffons nature, ſo he ſhould bee Maſter & controuler of all creatures hee can meet withall. And let this ſuffice thee, without further ſorow for the three womens death, that gaue him ſuck but hence forward let him bee nouriſhed with the milke of thy ſlocks and heardes, vntill it be the ſpace of a yeare; at which time, hee will be ſo well formed, as he ſhal reſemble vs al three. In the meane while, take heed (vpon perill of thy life) that thou, thy wife, or any other then ſhe that muſt tend him, doe ſee him; for elſe great harme will happen to thee.
                  For this cauſe, the Giant (willing to obey the command of his gods) prouided diligently for al that they had appointed him; and ſo this deuiliſh Monſter (for a whole yeares limitation) was nouriſhed and kept in a very cloſe Chamber. Which

time being accompliſhed, and the mother vnderſtanding by her who had him in gouerning, that hee was growne great and ſtrong, beyond all naturall capacity, had ſuch an earneſt deſire to ſee him, as ſhee cauſed the Giant to yeeld conſent. Entring both into the Chamber where hee was nouriſhed, and he ſeeing his mother; ſuddenly leapt about her ſhoulders, and caught ſuch hold about her neck, that before his father could lend any help, he cruelly kilde her. Whereat the Giant grew ſo enraged, that he ran on him to kil him, & in caſting a blow at him with all his might, the Sword rebounded backe vpon his owne leg, wounding it ſo deep, as in the extreme anguiſh he felt thereby, he fell downe to the ground, and there breathed his laſt. At the very ſame inſtant, the Monſter, being named Endriagus, finding the doore of the Chamber to ſtand open, flew thence into the mountaines, leauing all them in the Caſtell infected to death with his poyſon. Afterward, he did ſo many harmes in euery place, that al the inhabitants were glad to forſake the Country, or elſe to dye the death. Thus you haue heard, how this Iſle hath remained deſart for the ſpace of forty yeres, and ſo long is it ſince this helliſh Monſter hath heere liued in this manner.
                  By my faith, anſwered our knight, you haue told me wonders, wherein our Lord hath plainely declared, what long patience he hath vſed, in expecting amendment for the ſinnes of men; but finding them obſtinate & too hard-hearted, he hath continued this ſeuerity of vengeance. Neuertheleſſe, I am not to part away from this place, vntill I haue fought with this Endriagus: hoping aſſuredly, to reuenge the wrongs he hath done to ſo many, & to replant this Iſle again with people, that may religiouſly ſerue God. And becauſe the day was well neere ſpent, he put off his purpoſe till the morning, his company being minded not to leaue the Ship, becauſe their feare ſtil continued, beholding the ſea & tempeſt nothing appeaſed, but rather encreaſe more and more, by the Monſters houering ouer the Iſland, and eſpecially by the place where the Ship ancred. Night being ouerpaſt, & the bright morning appearing, he called for his Armes, and afterward heard Maſſe deuoutly: then ſummoning them of the Ship about him, he thus ſpake. Louing friends, I will go directly to the Caſtel to ſeek the Monſter: where (if it ſo pleaſe God) I may haue the victory ouer him. And becauſe it appeares to me, that in two or three dayes we ſhal hardly put to Sea againe. I intend, if I finde the Caſtel as yet habitable, to come again hither for ye, that you may remain in ſafe ſecurity, vntill the weather be more calme. So mounting on horſeback, and taking none but Gandalin in his company, they aſcē
                     ded vp the Rock, where preſently they eſpied the Fortreſſe, and ryding thither to it, found neither man or beaſt liuing in it. Heereupon after they had thorowly viſited it, and found it to bee ſtrong & wel-defenced, they returned to them in the ſhip, and cauſing them to bring victuals thither for three dayes, commending them all to God, he ſaid.
                  Stand vpon your guard ſo well as you can, for I muſt goe to effect mine enterpriſe: thus aduiſing you, that if I haue good ſucceſſe, Gandalin ſhal winde his Horne to ye, & giue you aſſurance thereby, that Endriagus is dead, and I liuing. But if the contrary happen to me, there ſhall be no need of any ſignall

to ye, becauſe you will know it ſoon enough. In the meane while, pray to GOD both for mee and your ſelues.
                  So ſetting on his way, hee left them ſad and mourning, for the ſmall hope they had of his returning. But their griefe could not be compared to that of Ardan the Dwarfe, who being compelled to leaue his knight, by a ſeueare command impoſed on him, made ſuch ruefull moane, as euery man tooke compaſſion on him. Alas, (quoth Ardan,) am not I the moſt miſerable wretch in the world, that when I haue moſt occaſion to follow my Maſter, neuer hauing forſaken him before in all my life, he ſhould now forbid and prohibite mee, as if I were a meere ſtranger to him? Then Maiſter Eliſabet called them all to prayer, while our knight and Gandalin were thwarting the Iſle among brakes and buſhes, and finding nothing. But Gandalin was ſo penſiue, as his Maiſter, perceiuing him to weepe, ſaid vnto him. Ah Gandalin, it appeareth by thy countenance, that being with me, thou art afraid to dye: I pray thee, kinde Squire, returne backe to the reſt, & there expect what ſhall become of me. If theſe teares proceede from any doubt in thee, that I cannot preuaile againſt the Monſter, aſſure thy ſelfe, that the hope I haue in the mercy of God, & the remembrance of my Lady, who now (euen at this very inſtant) preſents her ſelfe before mine eyes, doth arme me with ſuch ſtrength, as I am able to fight with the deuill himſelfe, if I could finde him. For my minde perſwades me, that I ſee her in the daunger of Endriagus, and that I am come hither to defend her: Ah Gandalin, canſt thou imagine, that I would ſuffer her to bee offended or outraged, conſidering, that on her, my life & beſt happines doth only depend?
                  So pauſing awhile, he then began againe thus. Doeſt not thou know (my louing Squire) that ſhee hath cauſed all the teares which haue bin ſhed by mee, and greater perils already paſt, then this can be? Beleeue me, Gandalin, I feele my forces newly redoubled, and my hopes a thouſand times more encreaſed, in but thinking of her, as I haue told thee. Then ſet aſide all feare, and cry and call as loude as thou canſt, that Endriagus may heare thee, and come hither to vs quickly, if hee be in thoſe parts. And one thing I doe moſt earneſtly entreate thee, to wit, that if I dye in this attempt, thou wouldſt compaſſe ſome meanes, to carry my heart to my Lady, which is intirely hers, and tell her I ſent it, that we appearing before God, hee may iudge, that I preſent her nothing, but what is her owne as well as mine.
                  When Gandalin heard theſe words, his heart was ſhut vp in ſorrow, as hee was ready to fall in a ſwou
                        •
                     e: deſirous rather of his own death, then (with paine) to accompliſh what his Maſter had commanded him. And as they inſiſted vpon theſe tearmes, they ſaw Endriagus come forth of a hollow Rocke, caſting from his eyes & throte flames & ſmoke ſo noyſome, as all the ayre thereabout was infected therewith. So ſoon as he had eſpied them, hee came towardes them, hiſſing & ſnoring in moſt admirable maner: notwithſtanding, it could not daunt our knight a iote, but he boldly marched to meete him, while Gandalin ran to hide himſelfe, fully perſwaded, that his Maiſter could neuer ſcape from ſuch a furious beaſt. Our knight perceiuing that hee could by no means cauſe his horſe to come nere

him; quickly diſmounted on foot, and taking his Launce in both his hands, aymed therewith ſo couragiouſly at Endriagus, that (by great good fortune) he gaue him a thruſt in the left eye, and put it quite out. Then Endriagus gaue a horrible dreadfull crye, and ariſing vp on his hindmoſt pawes, caught hold on the Launce ſo ſtrongly, as, intending to breake it between his teeth, he tooke it ſo farre into his mouth, that our knight eſpying ſo apt an aduantage, by aduancing it forward as occaſion ſerued, hee wounded him both in the tongue and throat, and left a part or tronchion thereof ſticking faſt betweene his teeth. Neuertheleſſe, hee gaue a great leape, purpoſing thereby to ſurprize the knight: but hee auoyded it by ſtepping aſide, and drawing forth his Sword, gaue him a manfull ſtroke therewith on the right ſhoulder, which proued to no purpoſe; for he might as well ſtrike on a rocke or anuile. Endriagus got hold of the Sword with his teeth; but by reaſon of the ſharpe ſteele, and part of the Launce troubling his throate, hee could not keepe it as hee intended. And that which hindred him moſt of all, was his great effuſion of blood, which ranne in ſuch abounding meaſure downe his throate, as he was ſcarcely able to draw any breath.
                  At length, he rent our knights Shield from about his neck ſo rudely, as his hands were his beſt helpes, to keepe him from the ground; and as he ſtroue to breake it in pieces, our Knight hauing recouered him-ſelfe, taking his Sword faſt in both his hands, ſmote on the top of his head but it entred no more then into a mount of Adamant.
                  Then he perſwaded himſelf, that except Heauen gaue him aſſiſtance, he meerely laboured in vaine: for he ſaw no place elſe where to hurt him, but in the other eye, which with great care) he kept and defended. Heereupon our knight made all his aime at that ſide, and proued ſo happy in his blow, that lighting on his ſnout, it entred into one of his noſtrils, (which were great and wide ſtaring) ſo farre, that it pierced the braine extreamely. This made Endriagus ſo mad, that hee got our knight faſt about the body, and with his ſharpe-pointed clawes, tore his coate of maile, yea, and entred through the fleſh to the bone: when queſtionleſſe he had quite kild him, but that his owne blood ſo ouerſtifled his ſtomacke, that, letting looſe his hold, he fell downe back-ward. And as he rendred his ſpirit, the deuill came out of his body, cauſing ſuch a clap of thunder, as all the whole Iſland ſhooke with the ſound thereof.
                  This noyſe being heard by them in the Caſtell, they perſwaded themſelues thereby, that their knight was then at the Combate: and albeit they were in a ſafe and well-defenced Fort, yet the beſt and boldeſt man of them all, was ouercome with extraordinary feare.
                  
                     Endriagus being thus vanquiſhed, our knight roſe very faintly; and purpoſing to goe finde Gandalin, (who was then comming towards him) hee fell downe againe in a ſwoune, by a little perling brooke, that deſcended from the mountaine.
                  Then Gandalin (imagining his Maiſter to bee dead) fell into moſt dolefull lamentations: but comming neere him, he beheld him to breath: wherupon he vnarmed him. Then recouering his ſpirits, called to Gandalin, ſaying. My deare Friend

                     Gandalin, now thou ſhalt ſee the ending of my dayes; let me entreate thee, by the kinde nouriſhing which I receiued from thy father and mother, that as thou haſt been loyall to me in my life, thou wilt continue ſo in death, and ſo ſoone as my vitall ſpirits haue forſaken me, to take out my heart, and beare it to my deareſt Miſtreſſe. Tell her Gandalin, that as it veelded it ſelfe hers the ſame day I firſt ſaw her, and euer ſince hath continued better and better in her ſeruice, while it was lockt vp in this breſt, or ſad habitation, neuer wearied in any obedience to her: that ſhee would be pleaſed ſo to receiue it now, in remembrance of him that kept it for her; and in ſo doing, I beleeue that my ſoule ſhall haue the happier reſt in another world.
                  As hee meant to ſpeake more, words fayled him, and againe hee ſwonded. Then Gandalin (without ſtaying to anſwere him) mounted on the top of the Rocke, and winded the horne which he caryed (to giue ſignall of the death of Endriagus) ſo loude, that Ardan the dwraff, who was then on the higheſt of one of the Caſtle Towers, eaſily heard it. Wherevpon hee ranne downe preſently, to acquaint Maiſter Eliſabet therwith; deſiring him to make haſte to his Maiſter, who (perhaps) ſtood in great neede of his helpe. Maiſter Eliſabet, hauing all things in a readineſſe, mounted on horſe-backe, directing his courſe as faſt as hee could ride, towards the place where hee ſtill heard the ſound of the Horne. Not long had he iourneyed, but he eſpyed Gandalin, who comming to meete him, cryed out afarre off: Alas Maiſter Eliſabet, Endriagus is dead: but if you prouide not the ſooner for my Lord, hee is gon likewiſe. How man quoth he? Alas, ſaid Gandalin, he hath already loſt ſo much blood, as hee is not a ble to ſpeake a word.
                  Very ſadde and ſorrowfull was Maiſter Eliſabet at theſe newes, and ran quickly to the place where the Knight lay, ſo weake and ouer ſpent as hee had no motion of his pulſe: yet his eyes were wide open, wherefore to comfort him, Maiſter Eliſabet ſayd. How Sir Kinght? will you declare ſuch debilitie of courage, hauing brought to end ſo great and glorious an interpriſe? doe yee not know, that I am heare to make you ſound and well againe, ſo ſoone as pleaſeth God. When the Knight heard him, hee ſtroue to make anſwere, but could not. Then they layd him ſoftly vpon a cloake, and hauing wholly vnarmed him, Maiſter Eliſabet viewed his wounds; which he found to be ſo many, and dangerous, as hee ſtood in great doubt of his recouery? Neuertheleſſe, hee reſolued to performe ſo much as poſſibly he could, and inſtantly applyed ſo ſoueraigne vnguents: as both ſtanched his bleeding; and ſo aſſawaged all vigour of paine, that his ſpeech came to him againe, when with a very feeble and low voyce, he thus ſpake.
                  Oh, my Lord God, who to redeeme mee tooke humaine fleſh, in the bleſſed Virgins wombe, and afterward didſt ſuffer a moſt dolorous and painefull Paſſion: take pitie on my ſoule, for I well knowe, that my bodie is no better then earth. Truely Sir, anſwered Maiſter Eliſabet, you haue good reaſon to recōmend yourſelf to him, conſidering that (by his aſſiſtance) you ſhall receiue the ſpeedier helpe. As he ended theſe words, there arriued diuers of the Marriners, who taking him vp gently in their armes: conuayed him thence to the Caſtle; where laying him in his bed, he was

ſo voyd of allhis ſences, as hee felt not any thing was done to him. Thus he continued all night, complayning continually, as one that endured much, yet without vttering any one worde, till about breake of day he fell aſleepe.
                  Hereupon, Maiſter Eliſabet commanded all to auoyd the chamber, to preuent any noiſe for offending him, and ſate downe cloſe by him, till hee heard him wake, and cry: Gandalin, Gandalin, ſhield thy ſelfe from this deuill, ſo cruell and daungerous. In good faith, Sir, replyed Maiſter Eliſabet; if you had been as ſafely ſhielded as hee, your health were the ſurer, and your recouerie the leſſer.
                  At theſe words, our Knight opened his eyes, and knowing Maiſter Eliſabet, ſaid vnto him; Oh, Maiſter, where are we? Where? quoth hee, in ſuch a place, where you ſhall doe well enough, by the grace of God. And perceiuing his Feauer to haue left him, hee brought him food to eate, & was ſo diligent in care ouer him, that (before night) hee recouered his memorie perfectly, and beganne to know and ſpeake to euery one.
                  Maiſter Eliſabet ſeeing all danger to be well quallified; both hee, and all the reſt gaue thanks to God for it, and continued ſtill ſo reſpectiue of him, as hee grewe hourely better and better: notwithſtanding for twentie dayes hee kept his bed, without any habilitie of riſing. At length, Maiſter Eliſabet perceiuing that (without any great perill to the his perſon) hee might endure the Sea, eſpecially his Feauers beginning to forſake him: one day as they ſate deuiſing together, he ſayd, My Lord, thankes be to God, you are ſoundly recouered, and (in mine opinion) when beſt ſhall pleaſe you, you may goe aboard your ſhippe: whereto (I ſo much the rather counſell you) becauſe our victuals growe ſo ſhort, that if wee diſlodge not hence the ſooner, we ſhall be quite emptied. My louing friend, anſwered our Knight, I may iuſtly ſay, that next vnto God, you are the man to whom I am moſt beholding, deliuering mee from the great daunger wherein I was. And let mee aſſure yee, that ſo long as my ſoule liueth as a gueſt in this bodie, you haue a Knight ready to bee employed for you, without reſeruation of hazard or perill whatſoeuer: for you haue done ſo much for me, (I being none other then a ſilly knight, deſtitute of all meanes, my beſt meanes conſiſting in a poore, broken and battered armour:) that while I ſhall enioy a day of life, you may worthily acknowledge it to be yours.
                  My Lord, anſwered Maiſter Eliſabet, you ſay what pleaſeth you of your ſelfe, but howſoeuer, I account my ſelfe the happieſt of all other profeſſing my Art; that vnder Gods aſſiſtaunce, I haue ſaued the life of the beſt Knight that euer backt a Courſer: which I dare publiquely auouch; you hauing attempted and finiſhed matters incredible to common iudgements. So that I am well aſſured, from this time foreward, many that haue endured ſhames and iniuries, muſt expect helpe by our means, whereas otherwiſe, they ſhall remaine miſerably without any hope. Therefore Ibeing borne to be the poore occaſion of ſo great a bleſſing; doe accompt my trauell more liberally recompenced, then if I had all the wealthy treaſures of the world together.
                  Worthy Friend, quoth our Knight, leaue theſe commendations to ſome other, on whom (happily) they may be more deſeruedly

beſtowed; and councell me I deſire ye, in the buſines I haue vndertaken, as I ſhall make it further knowen to ye: you are not ignorant, that in no meane griefe and heauineſſe, we parted from the Iſle of Romania, and by importunity of the Mariners only: wee ſet ſayle for further paſſage, as purpoſely bound for Conſtantinople, but that windes and tempeſts haue quite altered our courſe. All which notwithſtanding, for any perill I finde in my ſelfe, my minde varies not a iote from my firſt determination: ſo that if you can alleage no contradiction, I am more ready then euer, to aduenture the Sea for Greece, where I would gladly ſee the Emperour, and ſome ſingularities of the Countrie, which are no common matters to our knights of Gaule.
                  
                  Therefore, if you be as well contented, let vs away for that part: our returne to Graſinda alwayes remembred, at all times, when you pleaſe, and according to promiſe at our parting.
               
               
                  CHAP. XI.
                  
                     How the Knight of the greene Sword made knowen to the Emperour of Conſtantinople, (to whom the Iſland appertained, where he ſlew the Andriagus) the great fortune and victory he there obtained: And of matters happening to him afterward.
                  
                  
                     WHen Maiſter Eloſabet heard the minde of our knight of the greene Sword, which euermore was bent towardes Conſtantinople, he ſaid. Truſt me my Lord, I thinke it expedient then, that you ſhould firſt write a Letter, to giue aduertiſement, that by your meanes; but more eſpecially, the grace of our Lord aſſiſting, you haue deliuered this Country from the deuils ſlauery and ſubiection.
                  Deare Friend (quoth the knight) I vnderſtand, that you haue beene knowen to him a long time, but me he hath neuer ſeene: therefore doe you write ſuch a Letter, and according as your ſelfe ſhall beſt deuiſe it. Whereto Maiſter Eliſabet willingly conſented, and inſtantly wrote at large to the Emperour, all the aduentures happening to our knight, ſince they departed from Graſinda: eſpecially (how miraculouſly) he had fought with, and conquered Endriagus, a Monſter more diabolicall then humane. Deſiring him, in the knights name, to ſend people to replant, ſo deſart a place, and to let it be called thence-forward, Saint Mary Iſland.
                  So giuing the Letter to a Squire his kinſeman, hee commaunded him to goe to the Emperour, and to returne againe ſo ſoone as poſſibly hee could with prouiſion to revictuall their Ship.
                  Being imbarked, the winde ſate ſo proſperouſly for him, that on the third day following, he arriued at Conſtantinople, where the Emperour then being: after ſuch reuerence done as beſt beſeemed, hee preſented him the Letter from Maiſter Eliſabet, ſaying.
                  Sir, Maſter Eliſabet your moſt hū
                     ble and affectionate ſeruant, hath

ſent you this Letter, whereby (I hope) you will receiue no meane contentment. Then the Emperour tooke and read it, being mightily amazed, to vnderſtand that Endriagus was vanquiſhed, which cauſed him to ſpeake thus out aloud Before GOD, here are very ſtrange tydings. In the preſence then (among many others) were two Princes his moſt familiars, the one named Gaſtilles, ſonne to the Dutcheſſe of Garaſtra, his ſiſter; a Knight eſteemed among the beſt, and Count Salender, Brother to the faire Graſinda: taking them aſide, hee ſhewed them the Letter from Maiſter Eliſabet.
                  
                  After much admiration among them all, the Emperour ſayd. The Knight of the Greene Sword, of whom ſo many high prayſes are reported, hath ſlaine the monſter Endriagus in ſingle fight: and becauſe this meſſengers owne eyes are witneſſes thereof, I pray you let him make relation of what he knoweth. Vpon my faith, anſwered Gaſtilles, verily, it is a matter hardly to be credited, that a mortall man ſhould combate a Deuill with a Sworde: I thinke it was neuer read nor heard of before. Wherefore if it be ſo, as Maiſter Eliſabet hath written to ye, & that ſuch a man hath ſo much honoured yee, by comming into your Countrey, you ought to giue him the beſt entertainment can bee deuiſed. Let me tell ye, quoth the Emperour, what I haue determined. I thinke it not much amiſſe, that you, and Count Salender ſhould firſt goe to him, euen to the Iſland where (as yet) hee remaineth ſickly, and conduct him in the beſt maner you can imagine: taking along with you ſuch victuals and other neceſſaries, as is conuenient for ſuch a purpoſe. But aboue all the reſt, forget not to take ſome excellent Painter with you, to draw in naturall figure that horrible beaſt: becauſe there is no poſſibilitie of bringing him hither, yet we would haue his proportion ſo neere to the life as may be. For it is my purpoſe, where he hath been conquered, to erect a high Pillar of braſſe; on the top whereof ſhall be aduanced the Knights Figure that fought with him, and the Monſters alſo, in liuely ſhape: with ſo ample a diſcription in golden Charracters engrauen thereon: that all ſucceeding times may know this famous Action. In which reſpect, I pray ye to vſe your ſpeedieſt diligence, for I ſhall neuer reſt in quiet, vntill herein I am fully ſatisfied.
                  The two Princes, knowing the Emperours will, tooke ſo good order for their ſhipping, as very early the next morning they were embarked: when hoyſing Saile, with apt and proſperous windes, in few dayes they landed in the Iſle, Saint Marie: ſo newly called, at the requeſt of the Knight of the Greene Sword. Hee being aduertiſed of their arriuall, went to meete them; doing them all the honour that the time and place could permit: eſpecially to Count Salender, knowing him to be brother to the beautifull Graſinda. And although he looked ſomewhat wanne and meagre, by reaſon of his long ſicknes: yet our Grecians reputed him to be one of the moſt compleat Cheualiers, that euer they had ſeene. Wherevpon, after ceremonious welcoms ended on all ſides, Gaſtilles taking him by the hand ſayd: Sir Knight, Mine Vncle, the Emperour, hath ſent vs expreſly to you, to thanke you (in his behalfe) for the great good you haue done to this whole Countrey, which hath ſo long time layen waſt and ruined. Moreouer, for the earneſt deſire hee hath to ſee you; hee

entreateth you by vs, to paſſe (with what conuenient ſpeede you may) towards Conſtantinople, where hee will welcome you according to your due merit.
                  Lord Gaſtilles, anſwered our Knight, I haue ſo often heard of the Emperours goodneſſe and magnificēce, that although I neuer ſaw him: yet am I earneſtly deſirous to doe him any ſeruice: and to be employed as hee ſhall pleaſe to command me. I muſt further entreate you, ſaid Gaſtilles, to let vs ſee the Monſter Endriagus, that his liuely portraiture may be taken by an expert painter; which for the ſame purpoſe, is ſent hither with vs. Here is Maiſter Eliſabet, ſaid our Knight, and Gandalin my truſty Squire alſo, who was preſent whē I fought with the beaſt; they can eaſily conduct ye where he lieth. But I feare his body is ſo infectious, as you will hardly bee able to come neere it. Let vs make triall of that, replyed Count Salender, to giue the better report to others, how, and in what manner we found him. Our Knight perceiuing their vnalterable deſire, praied Maiſter Eliſabet to guide them to the place where hee was aſſailed, and to let them know the truth of all.
                  So they mounted on horſe-backe, for it was ſomewhat farre from the Gyants Caſtle, and (by the way) Gandalin reported to them, the manner of the ſights beginning, the doubt hee had of it, and little hope or expectation of his Maiſters returne. And in this time of conference they were come to the place, where Endriagus lay ſo ſtinking; as if Maiſter Eliſabet had not formerly giuen them excellent preſeruatiues, they had beene in great danger of their health. But by this meanes they might come the neerer to him; while the Painter drewe his Figure ſo artificially, as nothing was wanting but life it ſelfe. But the more they obſerued him, the more they found the aduenture to be: ſo that no iuſt comprehenſion could haue been made of the ſubſtance, except their eyes were reall witneſſe.
                  Afterward, they returned back to the caſtle again, and ſoiourned there with our knight three dayes, viſiting the Iſle in euery part: and the day following, they tooke ſhipping thence, with ſo good a gale of wind, that they took landing in the porte of Conſtantinople not long after.
                  The Emperour hauing intelligence thereof, ſent Chariots and horſes, for the Knights more honorable conuoye to his Court: and himſelfe, accompanied with a goodly Traine of Princes, and great Lords, rode in perſon to meete him. Our Knight offred to kiſſe his hand; but the Emperour embraced him, telling him, that hee was heartily welcome, as he that iuſtly deſerued by his valour, to hold ranke among the greateſt Lords of the world. For if I (quoth he) and ſuch as reſemble me, are conſtituted in the preeminence and authoritie of Emperours of Kings: it comes to vs by the meanes of our Predeceſſors, whe got and conſerued ſuch fortune for vs: but you hauing performed ſuch rare deeds of Chiualrie, are not only worthy of an Empire, but euen of the Monarchie of the whole world, and that meerly by merit.
                  You haue power, mighty Prince, anſwered our Knight, to paint me in what coulours you pleaſe: not withding, all that I am or can bee, is no more then your humble vaſſaile and ſeruant; & would it pleaſed God to afford ſuch means, as might expreſſe my earneſt loue to you, in any ſerious or importāt ſeruice. So ceaſing, the Emperour walked along with

him to a chamber which he had cauſed to be prepared for his lodging: being ſo faire & ſumptuouſly furniſhed, as neuer had the like bin ſeen: except that belonging to Apolidon, in the Firme Iſland. The Emperour with-drawing, left him accompanied with Gaſtilles, and Count Salender, & went to the Empreſſe giuing her to vnderſtand; that the Knight of the Greene ſword (ſo much renowned through the world) was come to Court: To whom he purpoſed all the kinde entertainment could be deuiſed.
                  And therefore Madame (quoth he) be not ſparing towardes him in the very beſt graces may be affoorded: commanding your Ladyes ſo to decke and adorne themſelues, that it may mooue his deſire to continue in our Court. For beſide his repute and eſtimation, of being the very beſt Knight in the world, and bringing vnder awe and obedience, that goodly Iſland, ſo long time diſpeopled: I am vndoubtedly perſwaded, that hee can bee none other, then ſome great Lord diſguiſed, for his better veiwe of ſtrange Princes eſtates; therefore let mee commend him to your very choyceſt reſpect. My Lord (quoth ſhe) ſeeing it is your pleaſure; I will not fayle in effectuall performing what you haue commanded me.
                  By this time it waxed and grew ſomewhat late, and our Knight finding himſelfe not halfe currant, after his ſayling on the Sea: departed not out of his chamber till the next morning, when hauing bin with the Emperour at Maſſe, he brought him afterward to ſee the Ladyes, all of them giuing him moſt gracious welcome, Eſpecially the Empreſſe. But hee fell on his knee before her, to kiſſe her hand, and as ſhee tooke him vp, hee ſaid: Madame, among all the bleſſings of heauen beſtowed vpon mee, I eſteeme this one of the chiefeſt, to haue the meanes of ſeeing the magnificence of the Emperours Court (famous in all places of the world) and that with ſuch affable lookes and entertainment, as I take no little care, how, or which way my power can euer ſtretch it ſelfe, to acknowledge this fauour by any dutious ſeruice. And I would I could tell you in good Greeke Language, how much I am, and deſire to be, wholly yours, but the ſlencer power I haue in this countrey, may excuſe my ill ſpeaking, and referre to full effect any thing wherein you pleaſe to command mee, and that ſhall beſt witneſſe my good will. Knight of the Greene Sword, ſaid she, the Emperour hath long time deſired to haue your company, & wiſheth with al his heart, that your mind were anſwerable to his, for your cō
                     tinuance ſtill heere with him.
                  So falling out of one diſcourſe into another, the Empreſſe beeing wise, and curious in vnderſtanding all Nouelties, eſpecially the qualities and faſhions of ſtrange remote Countries, enquired many matters of him; whereunto he knew how to anſwere, with ſo good a grace and diſcretion: that ſhe ſayd within her ſelfe, it is impoſſible, but hee muſt be of as great proweſſe as prudence. All this while the Emperour entertained the Queene Menor
                           •
                        ſſa, and other of the principall Ladyes, to whom hee ſaid: Can you giue ſuch welcome to our newe Knight, as may make him ours alwayes heer
                        •…
                      after? It may be ſweete Ladies, that therein you ſhould performe ſo famous a conqueſt, as neuer any beauties did the like: for I haue credibly heard, that infinite dangers of death can neuer daunt him, to maintaine all their rights that requeſt it of him.

In good faith, anſwered the Dutcheſſe, mother to Gaſtilles, we are all then highly beholding to him, ſeeing he is ſo ready to vſe his Sword, and ſtand as defence for all ſuch as are in need: no doubt, but Heauen will be his helpe, in defending him from all harme, and encreaſing his great renowne.
                  Then came Leonorina, the onely daughter to the Emperor, with the two daughters to Barandel, King of Hungarie 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      who was ſo rich in beauty, and all choyce perfections, that ſhe ſeemed a rare pearle among the very faireſt Princeſſes of the world. And that which moſt of all did illuſtrate her rarities, was her extraordinary wiſedome, and delicate carriage: in regard whereof, euery one tooke delight to behold her, but much more to keepe her company. Hauing done a gracious reuerence to the Emperour, and afterward to her Mother, ſhee ſate down at her feet. Then our Knight looking on her, remembred when Oriana was left by King Liſuart in SCOTLAND, being then about her age, at which time, Loue depriued him of his liberty, and gaue him wholly as her ſeruant. Immediatly, all the fauours of amitie, & gracious entertainments, ſince their firſt acquaintance, preſented themſelues to the eyes of his ſoule, and his affection being no way weakened or impaired, (either by length of time, or diſtance of place) but rather much more encreaſed, threw ſuch a ſudden amorous affliction vpon him, that he was wonderfully penſiue, & in this melancholy fit, he thus ſpake to himſelfe ſilently.
                  Oh happy priſon, which (by good reaſon) tooke my ſpirit captiue, for more admittance into greater libertie! Oh ſweet death, occaſion of a double life! Oh quick remēbrance, that canſt keepe ſuch an affectionat 
                        •
                     oue ſo couert! Poore Amadis, farre off from thy louely felicity, what canſt thou hope for heereafter? wouldſt thou hinder the iſſue of thy life, whereby thou mayſt be rid of ſo many miſeries? Ah Oriana, the true exemplary of all vertue, thy abſence is ſo grieuous to me, as I can neuer hope to recouer ioy.
                  With the concluſion of this priuate imparlance, he breathed forth a loud-ſpeaking ſigh; which the Emperour perceiuing, became full of maruaile, thinking ſome ſtrange accident had befalne him. But inſtantly, they noted a chearefull reuiuing of his ſpirits, and his lookes to bee as freſh and faire as before: yet as aſhamed of his ſoules ſudden rapture in this kinde, to lay his paſſions ſo open to euery eye, the new tincture in his countenance gaue euident teſtimony. This raiſed a more earneſt deſire in the Emperor, then before, to know whence ſuch a ſudden vnexſpected mutation ſhould proceed, vrging the opinion of Gaſtilles therein. Truſt me Sir (quoth he) I am not able to iudge in this caſe, but ratherſtand as one confounded, to ſee, that ſuch a man as he is, ſhould declare ſo little diſcretion in ſuch an aſſembly. Aſſure your ſelfe (replyed the Emperour,) this paſſion proceeded from ſome intimat affectiō, to her that hath the higheſt command ouer him. It may be ſo, anſwered Gaſtilles, but to clear all doubt, let M. Eliſabet be queſtioned in this caſe. Then was he called, & the Emperor ſaid to him. Eliſabet my long-loued friend, I am deſirous to know one thing of you, which I charge ye (by the faith you beare to God) to reſolue mee in if you can. And I ſweare to you vpon my ſoule, that by mee it ſhall neuer bee diſcouered. Sir, anſwered

Maiſter Eliſabet, you may well perſwade your ſelfe, that I will not lye to a perſonage of your greatneſſe, but will tell you freely any thing I know. Can you (quoth the Emperour) yeeld a reaſon, why our new-come knight both ſighed and wept ſo lately: I deſire you not to conceale it from me; for if hee ſtand in need of any thing whatſoeuer, aſſure your ſelfe, hee ſhall be ſupplied in ſuch good ſort, as he ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to ſhake off all melancholy. Sir (replyed Eliſabet) heerein I can ſay nothing to you; for he is ſuch a man, the very cloſeſt in ſuch maters, as he will not haue manifeſted, as I neuer ſaw the like. No man can better diſſemble his priuate fantaſies, & yet I haue often ſeene him in ſuch extremities, that if a man might gather iudgment by ſighing, I haue imagined, that his heart muſt needs ſplit in ſunder, yet neuer was it poſſible for me to know the cauſe. But thus much I verily conceiue, that it muſt needs be the controulling power of loue, which torments him in ſuch tyrannicall maner, being (perhaps) far off from her whō he affecteth. I iumpe with you in opinion (ſaid the Emperour) and I could well wiſh, that his loue were to ſome Lady of this country; for I would be ſo liberall in bountie to him, as there is neither King, Prince or Lord ſo potent, but might repute himſelfe happy, to match his daughter in marriage with him, that thereby we might be the more certaine of his company. And if you Maiſter Eliſabet, (my hearts true friend) can worke this mater out of him by your wit, reſt thus reſolued, that you ſhall well vnderſtand my acceptation of the ſeruice, which you may doe in this kinde; and therefore, let me perſwade you to purſue it. Sir (quoth he) you ſhall perceiue that I wil do my vttermoſt heerein. So the Emperor riſing, went to the Empreſſe, & taking her aſide, ſaid. Madame, you haue lately ſeen (as wel as my ſelfe) what ſadnes our knight of the greene Sword ſuddenly fell into, & we cannot gatherwhat ſhould moue him thereto: therfore I entreat you, to deuiſe ſome meanes, wherby we may know it: & likewiſe, if hee will conſent to ſtay here ſtill with me, I wil not be ſparing to him in any demaund whatſoeuer. My Lord, ſaid ſhe, it were beſt (in my iudgement) that to morrow we ſhould attempt this enterpriſe: for I will take him at ſuch apt oportunitie, as he ſhal haue work enough to deny me. In the meane while, I will allow ſuch gracious fauours towards him, as both you and I will preuaile in that wee would haue.
                  So they ſpent out the whole day, entertaining the knight, beyond all compas: and on the morrow, after Dinner, the Emperour cauſed the Ladies to meet there againe, where, at the firſt encounter, hee was charged by the Empreſſe, who, the better to gaine her intent, ſmyling, & as it were by way of deuiſing, ſaid. Sir Knight, ſince you came into this Court, I wel remember, that a mightie melancholy fitte ſeazed on you ſuddenly, and it is no longer ſince then yeſterday: let me entreate ye (fair Sir) to tel me whence it ſhould proceede; for if it were occaſioned by any iniurie, either done heere, or any-where elſe within the Emperors commaund, bee well aſſured, that you ſhall bee righted. And if it might ſtand with your good liking, to abide heere with my Lord the Emperor, no knight in all his houſe can find better welcome. & I would perſwade you thereto, if I might. Madam, (quoth he) if I had ſo much power as to commaund my ſelfe, I

ſhould thinke it a happines for me, to haue ſo gracious an offer: but being compelde to obey mine owne hearts affections, (which no way may permit it) I humbly entreate your Maieſty to hold me excuſed.
                  By this the Empreſſe well vnderſtood, that ſhe could neuer compas her intention; wherfore ſhe gaue a ſigne to the Emperor, that he ſhould come to them: which being done, ſhe began again thus. My Lord, I hope you will make good what I haue promiſed to this Knight: my requeſt to him, is, that he would remaine here in your Court, vnder this aſſurance, that hee ſhall be reſpected aboue any knight you haue, and yet no more then his owne due merite. Beleeue me Madame anſwered the Emperor, if hee graunt me this one fauour, I am as ready to afford him another: for, hee cannot aske me any thing that I will deny him. Sir, (replyed our knight,) you haue already done me ſo much honor, that I thinke my whole time cannot extend it ſelfe, to performe any ſuch ſeruice, as the very leaſt of your liberall fauours doe deſeruedly challenge. Neuertheleſſe, I haue bin ſo long a while out of mine owne liberty, by being ſubiected to the cō
                     mand of one only: as I neither can, nor willingly would offend there, to pleaſe any-where elſe. For I am certainly aſſured, that in doing otherwiſe, death wold not lōg ſuffer me to be your ſeruant, nor to cōtinue that duty, where I ſtand bound to pay it.
                  This anſwere was deliuered with ſuch vehemencie of paſſion, as teſtified ſufficiently to the Emperour, that Loue was ſoueraigne Lord ouer his affections: therfore he wold no further iwportune him, but entred into ſome other diſcourſe. While thus they held on conference, the faire Princeſſe Leonorina came in, carying two moſt rich Crowns, the one vpon her head, and the other between her hands; & going to the Knight of the Greene Sword, ſpake thus. Sir knight, I neuer yet begd any gift, but of the Emperor my Father: notwithſtanding, I now preſume vpon ſuch boldnes, as to requeſt one of you, if you pleaſed to grant it me. How Madame? (quoth he) can any Gentleman bee found ſo hard-hearted, that dare refuſe ſo faire a Lady, in any motion ſhe ſhall make vnto him? As for my ſelfe, I promiſe to obey you, in any matter you pleaſe to command me.
                  The yong Princeſſe thanked him moſt affectionatly, and taking the Crown frō off her head, ſaid to him: I pray you Sir, ſeeing you promiſe to doe ſo much for me, to preſent this Crown to the very faireſt Gentlewoman you know, & ſaluting her on my behalfe, to entreate her to afford me ſo kind fauor, as to acquaint me with ſome tydings from her, eyther by writing, or word of mouth. The Knight took the Crowne, & as he was about to anſwer, ſhe preuented him, continuing on her ſpeech in this manner. And this other Crowne, (not a iote leſſe richer then the firſt) ſhalbe for the moſt excellent Lady that you know, to whō, if you be ſo pleaſed, do from me the like meſſage. Yet my lōging is ſuch, as I pray you tell me preſently, what they are, to whom you mean to giue them. Madame (quoth he) by the faith I beare to God, your own ſelfe muſt haue the firſt, and none other; for you are the very faireſt Gentlewomā that I know. As he thus ſpake, he placed the Crown again vpō her head, & (looking about him, ſaid: If there be any knight that dare maintaine the contrary, I am ready to combate him.
                  Great pleaſure tooke the Emperour,

and the whole company, to behold Leonorina vſe ſo gallant a grace to the Knight: neuertheleſſe, becauſe ſhee was the maine obiect of euery eye, ſhe began to bluſh, which made her appeare much more beautifull. Then the Empreſſe tooke occaſion to ſpeake, ſaying: You ſpeake your pleaſure Sir, of this Gentlewoman: but I had rather haue thoſe Knights to doe me ſeruice, whom you haue conquered in Armes, then thoſe that ſhe hath won by her beauty. But he returned her no anſwere, becauſe Leonorina preſented her ſelf again, ſaying: I confeſſe Sir, that you haue done much more for me, then I know how to deſerue: and yet this cannot with-hold me, from coniuring you (by the thing you moſt dearely affect, aboue all other in the world) to tell me, why you wept yeſterday, and what the Ladie is, to whom your heart is moſt engadged in obedience.
                  When our Knight ſaw ſo ſeuere an iniunction impoſed vpon him, to diſcloſe that which he moſt coueted to conceale, he ſtood in doubt, that the Infanta was enforced to do this by the Emperor, or elſe ſome other, that would know more then he was willing they ſhould. Whereupon, his colour changed in ſuch ſort, as euery one did plainly perceiue it: & taking a long pauſe before he ſpake, at laſt he thus proceeded. Madame, I moſt humbly beſeech you, to accept ſome other ſeruice of me, & to quit me of this requeſt. You know Sir (quoth ſhe) what you haue promiſed, & I as wel know likewiſe, that if you breake not your word, you muſt tell me what I deſire to know. Why then Madame (ſaid he) I will doe it, ſeeing you enforce me to it. When I beheld you firſt, faire Princeſſe, I called to mind, that about the time & age wherin you are; Fortune preſented mee with gracious entertainment, by louing a Lady wholly like to you. So that my heart then being far diſtant from his true felicity, gaue teſtimony (by mine eyes) of his piercing paſſions, ſomewhat to allay the extremity of his torments, whereof it appeares you tooke too much notice.
                  Now, in regard of the aduantage you tooke of my word, being deſirous to know what ſhe is, to whom (at this inſtant) I ſtand moſt obliged: if you would pleaſe to forbeare ſuch an vnneceſſary motion, I ſhould eſteem your prudence more intire then I doe, inplaying thus on the poore diſcretion of a ſilly errant Knight, to diſcloſe more then hee would, and what he moſt deſires to keepe concealed. Neuertheles, ſince I muſt needs paſſe on further in this affliction, I ſweare to you Madame, by my faith, that it is ſhee to whom you haue ſent this other Crowne, who is (as I thinke) the very faireſt Lady that euer was, or euer ſhall be among the moſt perfect. Now content your ſelfe, faire Princeſſe, without forcing me any further. Vpon my word, replyed the Emperor, ſhe ſhall not, and ſo far our knowledge is enlarged by your relation, that we are euen as wiſe now, as when we began. And yet (anſwered our Knight) I haue ſaid more now, then euer I did before: whereto I was more willing, becauſe Madame Leonorina ſhould well perceiue, how ready I am to doe any ſeruice for her. You may wel Sir, quoth the Emperor, be allowed to keepe ſecrets, when your greatſt reuealings are mere ridls to vs: & therfore ſeeing ſhee hath offended you, reaſon requires that ſhee make amends. Pardon me my Lord, ſaid our knight, in your better opinion, for if ſhe haue offended, let her be rankt among thē, that can induce

and perſwade ſuch demaunds to a poore knight errant, who (as yet) is ſo ſlenderly acquainted with the Greeke tongue, that, when he offers to ſpeake, he may well be laught at, for his fooliſh babbling. Indeed Sir, (quoth the Emperour) I onely am the cauſe of all this contending; and therefore we muſt needs make an end together. The amends, ſaid our knight, is too much made already my Lord: prouided, that I may remaine in your good conceit, and that you will remember me hereafter. Let me tell ye Sir, anſwered the Emperor, that heereof you cannot fail, nor in any ſatisfaction that I can make ye, although you ſhould ſtand obſtinat againſt the permiſſiō.
                  Now, albeit the Emperour ſpake theſe words in ieſt, yet followed a time, that they fell out to good earneſt, as you will finde more at large in the fourth Booke following. Sir knight, ſaid Leonorina, I know that I haue done you wrong; and ſeeing it is not in my power, at this preſent, to make you a ſufficient amends: I beſeech you to accept this Ring, euen with as good a heart, as I was deſirous to know of you all that I demaunded. Taking it from off her finger, he ſtepped forward to giue it him▪ but in ſteed of the Iewell, he tooke her by the hand, ſaying. Madame, this white and delicate hand, is more worthy to be kiſſed, then any other that I haue ſeene within this yeares compaſſe: and the Ring may well repute it ſelfe happy, to be circled with ſo high an honor; therfore pardon me, I pray ye, and ſuffer me to kiſſe it. All this Sir, (quoth ſhe) cannot hinder the Ring to bee yours, & ſo ſhe preſented it to him again whereof he durſt make no refuſall, but in ſetting one knee to the ground, took it, & ſweetly kiſſed her hand. Aſſure your ſelfe Sir, ſaid ſhe, that you haue ſo excellent a ſtone, as I eſteeme it to bee the onely one of that kinde: albeit I haue the very like in the Crowne which you gaue me backe againe, which two ſtones (indeed) ſhould be but one. So help me God, replied our knight, it is not to be admired, that a thing ſo rare, ſhould bee in the power of the worlds choyceſt Lady: for, like as ſuch a precious Iewell is not eaſily come by; as hardly (I think) can all the Eaſt yeeld another to go beyond you, either in wiſdome, knowledge, and all good graces elſe; therefore this Iewell is only fit for you, before any other. With that the Emperor ſtept in, ſaying. Let me tell ye Sir, when you know from whence it came, you wil make much greater eſtimation of it: & if you obſerue the excellency of the Ring, you will find it worthy of right good keeping: For it is (of an Emerauld) as faire as poſſible can be: and the reſt is a Rubie of two colours by nature, the one red as blood, the other white as ſnow. Then know Sir, that Apolidon my Grand-father, (whoſe renown hath long time circled the whole earth, though I know not whether as yet it came to your ears) holding the place that now I doe, among many other ſingular things giuen him by Filipane, King of India: he ſent him twelue Crownes, the very richeſt that could be ſeene: And although they were of ineſtimable value, yet there was one to be prized aboue all the reſt; and that is it which my daughter preſented you firſt, wherin the ſtone (being whole was then enchaſed. But Apolidon finding it to be ſo ſtrange, cauſed it to be cut in twain, leauing one of the parts in the Crowne, which he gaue to his Queen & wife Grimeneſa, whō he loued ſo dearely, as more loyall louers were neuer heard of: & kept

the other moitie for himſelfe, which hee wore ſo long as he liued in this Ring, and which, I pray you keepe for her ſake, that gaue it you with ſo good a heart. And if at any time you haue occaſion to part with it, let it be to ſome one of your kinred, to the end, that if Fortune conduct him into theſe parts, hee may know and ſerue the Lady that gaue it you, if ſhe ſtand in need thereof.
                  And ſo it came to paſſe after-ward; for it fell into the power of Eſplandian, who for the loue of her, (ſome ſhort while after) performed many deedes of Chiualry, as you ſhall vnderſtand in the fift Booke. Sir, anſwered our knight, I haue often heard ſpeech of that Apoliaon, who builded the Arche of loyall Louers in the Firme I
                           ••
                        and, where I my ſelf haue bin, trauailing through the country of Great Brittaine: there alſo I ſaw the figures of him and his faire Grimeneſa, with many other ſingularities, which are there at this preſent.
                  Perhaps then (quoth the Emperour,) you know the knight that conquered the Enchanted Palace, whereof I heard ſo much report. Sir, ſaid he, I haue diuers times ſpoken with him, and hee cals himſelfe Amadis, Sonne to King Perion of Gaule, who is talked of in many places. It is he that was found floting on the water, whereupon hee was tearmed the Gentleman of the Sea. In a plaine field of battell, he vanquiſhed Abies, the moſt potent King of Ireland, and there the King, his father and his mother knew him to be their Sonne. On my ſoule, (ſaid the Emperour,) but that I am perſwaded, that ſo great a Lord would not vndertake ſo long a iourney, I ſhould thinke it were your ſelfe that you ſpeake of, and I ſhould hardly bee altered otherwiſe.
                  Our knight made him no aunſwere at all, but changing into other conference, at length they brake off, and ſixe whole dayes he remayned in Conſtantinople, during which time, neuer had man more honourable entertainment. And becauſe the time drew neere of his promiſed returne to Graſinda againe, he purpoſed to take his leaue, cauſing his Ship to be in a readineſſe, and finding the Emperour at conuenient leyſure, hee thus cloſed with him. Sir, you haue beſtowed ſo much honour and reſpect vpon me, as I can come in no place whereſoeuer, but you may boldly ſay, that I am your ſeruant, ready to obey all your commaunds, as often as you ſhall pleaſe to imploy me. And becauſe I intend ſhortly to bee in the marches of Romania, according to a ſolemne promiſe made, I moſt humbly beſeech you to licence my departure. Worthy Friend (anſweced the Emperour,) if it were poſſible, that you could afford longer abiding heere, you might doe me an infinite pleaſure: but ſeeing your promiſe hath ſo ſtrictly engadged you, God forbid, that I ſhould cauſe you, or any other, to falſifie your word.
                  Sir, (ſaid our knight) I dare aſſure you, that my honour will bee highly wrongd in doing otherwiſe, as it is well knowne to Maſter Eliſabet; therefore I entreat you to detaine mee no longer. Well then, (quoth the Emperour) I am contented: prouided, that without any contradiction, you graunt mee three dayes longer ſtay. Your will bee done Sir, ſaide our knight, ſeeing it is your pleaſure to haue it ſo.
                  The ſaire Princeſſe Leonorina nor being preſent at this parlie, ſhee

ſent for him into her chamber, and being in the midſt of her Ladies, ſhe ſaid vnto him. Sir, you haue graunted the Emperour (as I am enformed) three dayes more to keepe him company: Faire Knight, let me entreate ye to afford me two dayes beſide his, during which time, you ſhall be dayly (if you pleaſe) with me and my Gentlewomen, becauſe without any impeachement, wee may the better gouerne you. Therefore aduiſe your ſelfe, with a good heart, we hauing you heere among vs, will compell you thereto per
                        •••
                     ce.
                  As ſhee thus ſpake, ſhee made a ſigne to her Gentlewomen, to lay hold on him. Seeing himſelfe thus engirt by them all, what amiable graces, and milde forces they ſeazed him with, by a voluntary importunity, he promiſed to obey them, in this, or what elſe they would command him; and ſmyling, hee thus ſpeke vnto the Princeſſe Leonorina. Why Madame, being vnable to eſcape ſo ſharpe an impriſonment, as is heere preſented to my face, doe you imagine that I dare any way contradict you or yours? In good faith Sir, anſwered one of the Gentlewomen, you doe the wiſer; for if you did the contrary, you would be in greater daunger, then when you fought with the Monſter Endriagus.
                  
                  Truely Ladies, (quoth he) I beleeue ye aſſuredly, conſidering it is certaine, that a man ſhall haue more labour in offending ſuch Angels, then if he contended againſt twenty worſe Deuils then he was. Wherefore, I had much rather attempt againe ſuch another like warre as that, then fall into the perill of your diſpleaſure. Remember then Sir, anſwered Leonorina, what you haue promiſed, and looke that you bee carefull in keeping it.
                  Thus our knight continued in Conſtantinople fiue dayes longer then he purpoſed, during all which time, he was a good companion among the Ladies and Gentlewomen: who neuer ceaſed to enquire of him, concerning the ſingularities of the Firme Iſland, the Defended Chamber, the Arche of lorall Louers, and alſo the Portraitures of Apolido
                           •
                         and Grimeneſa. Likewiſe concerning the Ladies of King Liſuarts Court, the faſhion of their garments, their manner of behauiour; and a thouſand other things, ſuch as ouer curious women moſt commonly couet to know. And as hee made anſwere ſtil to his beſt power, in caſes of this nature; he conſidered with himſelfe, that if his Oriana could haue made one in this faire company, he ſhould haue thought, that all the bright beauties in the world were there congregated together. At laſt, he grew ſo diſtracted in his ſoule, that words began to faile him, and he ſtood as falne into a traunce. Which the Queene Menoreſſa (Lady of the Iſle Gabaſta) perceiuing, ſhee held him ſo ſtrongly by the arme, that immediatly hee came to himſelfe againe.
                  Then he well perceiued, that hee had fayled in ſome one kinde or other; wherefore, in excuſe of him-ſelfe, he ſaid vnto them. I beſeech ye Ladies, thinke it not ſtrange, that hauing before mine eyes ſo many admirable beauties, wherewith both God and Nature hath bounteouſly enriched you all: I ſhould finde my ſences quite tranſported from their vſuall courſe, by remembring one, of whom I did ſometimes receiue ſo many gracious fauours, that finding my ſelfe now to bee farre off from her; I endure a torment worſe then death, my ſpirit being rapt out

of my body, and liuing in her, to ſerue and obey her as I ought to do. Wherefore, Loue being to blame, for the fault wherein I haue offended before you; ſhould deſeruedly receiue the puniſhment, and not I, whom hee▪ tormenteth with too much rigour.
                  Great compaſſion tooke all the Ladies and Gentlewomen on the affliction, which they beheld our Knight continually to ſuffer, and euery one ſtroue to comfort him ſo well as ſhe could. But the day being come, when he muſt needes take leaue for imbarquing himſelfe: the Queene Menoreſſa, (who bare him an intire ſecret affection) ſaid vnto him. Sir Knight, by ſomething that I know, your long abſence hence will ſcarcely be well taken: but ſeeing wee muſt needes endure your loſſe, I pray yee to accept a gift of me, which I am very deſirous to beſtow vpon you. Then ſhee called for ſixe Swords, the very faireſt and beſt tempered that euer were ſeene: deſiring him to furniſh his friends with them, and not to be vnmindfull of her.
                  Madame, (quoth the Knight,) your gift is ſuch, that (for your ſake (they ſhall come to the hands of ſixe knights, the beſt (in mine opinion) this day liuing, and of whom you may and ſhall diſpoſe at all times, and in all affaires you will pleaſe to command them. That is the matter, (ſaid the Princeſſe Leonorina,) which wee all together moue vnto you. By my faith, Madame, quoth he, all my life-time, I ſhall be yours, ready in obeiſance, when you pleaſe to imploy me. I thanke you Sir, replyed the Princeſſe, and doe more-ouer entreate you, that you would pleaſe ſo much to honour vs, as to ſend hither ſomeone of your linage, to remaine particularly ours, and to ſerue vs all, as need ſhall require Madame (quoth hee,) I make no doubt, but, before any long time, to ſend you a neere kinfeman of mine: who being in your ſeruice, you may well vaunt, that you haue one of the beſt knights in the world.
                  This he ſpake, as thinking of his Brother Galaor, whom he intended to cauſe to come and ſerue the 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     perour, both for the augmentation of his renowne, and the bigher honour of the Princeſſe. But it fel out otherwiſe; for in ſteed of Galaor, Eſplandian arriued there ſome while after; who for the loue of the I'rin ceſſe Leonorina, fought many a braue fight, as you ſhall vnderſtand when we come to ſpeake thereof. Let it ſuffiſe vs now, that the knight of the greene Sword was ſhipt as that day, and ſetting ſayle with Maſter Eliſabet, launched forth into the maine, bound with proſperous gales for his returne to Remania. Wherefore we will be a while ſilent of him to tel ye, that much about this ſeaſon, the Prince Saluſte Quide, & the Queene Sardamira, with their traine, arriued in Great Brittaine, to conclude with King Liſuart, the marriage of the Emperour and Oriana. And perſwading themſelues, that the voyage ſhould anſwere their owne intention, they publiſhed in all places as they paſſed along, that they ſhould ſhortly returne backe with the Empreſſe. But GOD, (in whoſe hand all things are) declared heerein, that hee doth oftentimes diſpoſe matters, quite contrary to the opinion of men, who neither loue or repoſe any confidence in him: but thinke to command both times and the ſtarres, according as it commeth into their owne braine. Wherein they finde themſelues both

mockt and deceiued, 
                        •
                     euen as theſe Ambaſſadours did, who were entertained with the greateſt triumphes and honour, that the King could poſſibly make them.
               
               
                  CHAP. XII.
                  
                     How the Knight of the greene Sword departed from Conſtantinople, to ſatisfie the promiſe which hee formerly had made to the faire Graſinda: And of that which afterward happened to him.
                  
                  
                     OVr knight of the green Sword being on Shipboord, and ſet foorth from the Port of Conſtantinople; as already hath beene related to yee: the windes were ſo fauourable to him, that in leſſe then twenty dayes hee arriued at the place, where the faire Graſinda liued in exſpectation of him.
                  And albeit hee was yet farre off from Great Brittaine, yet notwithſtanding, finding himſelfe approaching towards the place, that gaue his heart beſt life and encouragement, his hopes did ſo heighten themſelues, and his ſpirits were ſo graciouſly cheared, as not anything ſeemed now impoſſible to his apprehenſion, though (in fiue yeares abſence) he had endured a world of afflictions. And now euen as if he felt the heauenly ayre of Great Britaine, his foule laboured with an infinity of diſcourſe, concerning what things he was to performe, & what meanes he ſhould compaſſe, to w
                        •
                     nne but a ſight of his Oriana.
                  
                  Now, long before his landing, Graſinda had heard by many, what worthy deeds of Chiualrie he had done in all the Iſlands of Romania: wherefore, being certified of his arriuall, accompanied with many knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen of the Country, ſhee went to wel-come him as honourably as might be.
                  Then conducting him to her Palace, there wanted no entertainment that beſt could expreſſe her affection towards him, and thus ſhe ſpake. Beleeue me Sir Knight, if formerly I held a good opinion of you, at this preſent it is much more encreaſed, conſidering how faithfully you haue kept promiſe with me, in being returned from your long voyage, before a yeare is fully compleated. Which armeth mee with a perfect perſwaſion, that hauing not fayled in the firſt, you will doe the like in the next, which (according to ſome conference paſſed betweene vs, a little before your embarquing for Greece) I purpoſed to acquaint you with all at your returne.
                  Madame (quoth he) God forbid, that during al my life-time, I ſhould any way ſhew my ſelfe vnthankfull to you: for you haue ſo farre obliged me to you, that I muſt in dutie confeſſe, that (next vnder God and Maſter Eliſabet) who by your command hath kept mee company) I meerely hold my life by your meanes: and therefore you may diſpoſe of me, as ſhee that wholly hath power ouer me. Surely Sir,

ſaid ſhee, if hee haue done you any acceptable ſeruice, I repute it as mine, and take it in as kind part, as if it were performed to mine owne ſelfe.
                  Now, becauſe Supper-time drew neere, and the whole day had beene ſomewhat contagiouſly hot, ſhee commanded the Tables to be couered in a moſt delightfull Arbour, where all varieties of poſſible pleaſures were plenteouſly to be ſeene, and all delicate viands ſo ſumptuouſly ſerued in, as it exceeded the compaſſe of any expreſſion. Supper being ended, they went diſcourſing together ſo long about the faire walkes, that night ouer-took them: which cauſed Graſinda to conduct him to his Chamber, where in honorable manner ſhe tooke leaue of him.
                  Our Knight being in bed, in ſteed of ſleeping, he fell into his accuſtomed melancholy; and, as if Oriana had bin there preſent, hee thus diſcourſed with himſelfe: Alas, faire Friend, my long abſence from your perſon, hath loaded my ſoule with ſo many dolorous paſſions, that, but for feare of diſpleaſing you, Death had long ſince wrapt mee vp in my graue, and depriued me of my onely happines, which conſiſteth in the ſight of you. Oh mine eyes, are you not aſhamed to exhauſte (by throwing forth teares) the ſcarcitie of humour, wherein my 
                        •
                     ad heart nouriſheth it ſelfe, in exſpectation of my returne towards her; for whoſe ſeruice onely, my ſpirit contents it ſelf to breathe in this toyling body? Alas, the more hope you haue of ſeeing her againe, the higher do you attaine to happines, by ſuch fauours as ſhe hath extended to you, farre beyond your merit. Moreouer, you may well remaine aſſured, that her loyaltie is ſo conſtant, as, (by any accident that can happen) ſhe will neuer varie, vnderſtanding my fidelity in her owne ſoule to be ſuch, as I had rather dye an hundred thouſand times, then to loſe the leaſt glimpſe of her kind fauour.
                  Theſe words were ſo loudly deliuered by our Knight, that Gandalin (who ſlept ſoundly) awaking at the noyſe, ſtarted vp, and asked if hee would commaund him any ſeruice. Alas Gandalin, quoth he, I pray thee take no heed of mine vnruly paſſions, but reſt contented, that I muſt ſuffer them, ſeeing Loue hath brought mee into this extremity. You are a ſtrange man, replyed Gandalin, thus to afflict your ſelfe, when you ſhould be moſt comforted and cheared in heart, conſidering, that we are well on-ward in the way, of returning to your Lady Oriana, for whoſe ſake you ſuffer all theſe torments. And me thinks you ſhould doe well to throw off theſe diſturbing paſſions, which preſent ineuitable perill of life, and draw on danger of ſicknes, when you ſhould haue moſt need of health: for, grief begets ouer-haſty infirmities, which will hardly be auoided at the largeſt leyſure; therefore good Sir, take reſt if you can. How? quoth hee, canſt thou talke of reſt, or returning to Oriana: conſidering what a promiſe I haue made to Graſinda, which may commaund me further off from her, then hitherto I haue beene:
                  I cannot thinke ſo Sir, anſwered Gandalin, but am rather perſwaded, that her motiō may draw you nerer to her, then you can imagine. What ſayſt thou Gandalin? replyed our Knight, doeſt thou thinke that Fortune can be ſo fauourable to mee? Aſſure thy ſelfe, if ſo great a good might befall me, I could bee well content, to forgiue all her former

cruelties; which, ſince I was caſt vpon the Sea, ſhe hath infinit wayes impoſed on me. And if euer I happen to ſuch a place, where I may compaſſe any meanes for ſending thee to Oriana, wilt thou doe ſo much for me, to carry her immediate tydings of me, and make mee once more as happy, as when thou wentſt firſt to her, at my returne from Gaule? How ſayſt thou? doeſt thou remember it? That doe I Sir, ſaid Gandalin, and can as well ſpeake to her, and make diſcourſe of all your life, as euer I did, if you dare repoſe ſo much truſt in mee; for I know both the Saint and ſhrine ſhe is deuoted to; and therefore, in the meane while Sir, let me entreat you to be of good courage.
                  Thus ſpent they out the moſt part of the night, deuiſing together on ſuch attempts, as might happen by the way in their returne to Great Brittaine. Earely the next morning our Knight aroſe, and went to finde the Ladies, who were hearing Maſſe; which being ended, Graſinda tooke him by the hand, and leading him ſomewhat aſide, began in this manner.
                  Vnderſtand Sir knight, that about a yeare before you came into this Country, I happened into an aſſembly, procured by the Duke of Baſile, whereto al the faire Ladies and Gentle-women of theſe parts were ſummoned. As we were in the chiefeſt of our good cheare, I know not by what occaſion, but my Brother the Marqueſſe Salender (a man whom you well know, and in whoſe cuſtodie I then was) ſpake out aloude before all there preſent, that my beauty was ſo highly excelling, as no one in all the company might be compared with me; and if any Knight durſt maintain the contrary, hee was there ready to enter Combate with him. Notwithſtanding, either becauſe he was valiant, and therefore much feared; or whether the whole aſſembly ioyned with him in opinion, there was no one would contradict him. By which meanes, I bare away the ſupreme honour, from all the fayreſt Ladies in Romania, to my no ſmall pleaſure and contentment, as is very eaſie for you to imagine. And now Sir, if (by your meanes) I might attaine to a further paſſage, and reach to that heighth, which my heart hath euer ſince aymed at, and deſired, I ſhould account my ſelfe the happieſt Lady in the world. Madame (quoth he) commaund mee what you pleaſe, and if it be in my power to performe, bee well aſſured, you ſhall finde mee ready in obedience.
                  Heereupon ſhe thus proceeded. My Lord, I haue heard, that in the Court of King Liſuart, are the onely bright beauties, not to be matched: if you pleaſe to conduct me thither, and there to au ouch as much for me, either by Armes, or otherwiſe, that I may haue the honour aboue them, as already I enioy ouer thoſe of this Country, I ſhall confeſſe my ſelfe more beholding to you, then to all the other Knights in the world: for I haue no other motion then this to make vnto you, and which moſt earneſtly I beſeech you to graunt. Whereto if you condiſcend, I haue reſolued on a ſpeedie parting hence, and to be attended with ſuch a company, as ſhall highly honor ſo good a knight as you are. And this may the more encourage you, becauſe in the preſence of the King of Great Brittain, and all the Lords and Ladies of his Court, you muſt maintaine, that the Lady you haue brought thither, (which ſhall bee my ſelfe) is fairer

then any Maiden there to be found, which, if any one dare gainſay, by force of Armes you will compell him to deny it.
                  And for further enlarging the glory of the Conquerour, you ſhall weare a Crown vpon your Helmet, which I will cary along with me, and he againſt whom you contend, ſhall haue another, that the conquerour (in ſigne of triumph) may alſo weare that of the conquered. Wherein if Fortune ſtand fauourable to vs, and that you finiſh this enterpriſe according to my minde, then I muſt further entreate you, to conduct mee into the Firme Iſland, where (as I haue heard) is an enchanted Chamber, that no Lady or Gentle-woman can enter into, except ſhee excell Grimeneſa in beauty, who neuer could be equalled by any. Then will my chiefeſt deſires be accompliſhed, and you diſcharged of your promiſe made mee: therefore, aduiſe well with your ſelfe, whether you intend to deny me, or no.
                  When our Knight had heard this diſcourſe, he ſuddenly changed colour, and thus replyed. Alas Madame, you haue vndone me, in vrging a mater ſo far out of my power, and haue euen ſtrooke me dead with your words. This he ſpake, conſidering what wrong he ſhould offer Oriana, in attempting a labour ſo highly to her diſhonour. And on the other ſide, he was well aſſured to finde an infinite number of good Knights in King Liſuarts Court, who, by any perill that might happen, would not endure ſo deepe an indignitie: beſide, this was the readieſt way, whereby he might fall into his Ladies diſ-fauour, and (perhaps) procure his owne death by this meanes.
                  In conſideration of all theſe inconueniences, he called to minde alſo, his kinde entertainments receiued by Graſinda, what a helpe ſhe had beene to him in ſo vrgent a neceſſity, and how he had bound him-ſelfe to her by voluntary promiſe: theſe contended ſo mainly with his other cogitations, that when his ſeruice to Oriana, checkt him from purſuing this enterpriſe, reaſon rerequired, and enforced him to the contrary. Heereupon, he fell into ſuch a perplexitie, that he wiſhed hee had neuer beene borne, and curſed Fortune, who was ſo contrary to him in all occaſions.
                  Then ſuddenly he called to mind, that Oriana was no Maide, but a troth-plighted wife, hauing had a child, as Mabila had ſent him word: and therefore, he that ſhould maintaine a fairer Maide, then Graſinda was a faire wife, ſhould receiue ſhame, and ſo by good reaſon, he might enter the Combate with him. Which either before, or afterward, (as he found time, place and oportunitie to fauour him) he would make knowen to the Princeſſe: And therfore, as one awaked out of a ſerious ſtudie, or eſcaped from ſome melancholy dungeon, he began to eleuate his ſpirits, and with a ſmyling countenance, thus he ſpake to Graſinda.
                  
                  Madame, moſt humbly I beſeech you to pardon the fault wherein I haue offended, which proceeded not from any feare, to vndertake the very greateſt matter that you can command me, or the moſt difficult danger wherein you pleaſe to imploy me: but my heart hauing ſole ſoueraignty ouer mee, ſought to make vſe of me elſewhere, had not the obligation, wherein I ſtandmoſt ſtrictly bound to you (for ſo many high and gracefull fauors done me)

preuailed againſt him, in crauing leaue to obey your diſpoſition, which I am ready 
                        •
                     o performe conditionally, that, without any regard of my indiſcreete anſwere, you will vouchſafe to remit this errour. In good faith Sir knight, anſwered Graſinda, I was much amazed, to ſee your ſudden alteration, and heare your refuſall of ſuch a matter, as cannot but redound to your honor, and my glory. But perceiuing you are now in ſo good a deliberation, I pray you to continue it: being aſſured, that (by your meanes) I ſhall gaine the like honour ouer the maydes of Great Brittaine, as I haue already wonne from the Ladies of Romania, and that I may (afterward) iuſtly weare the two Crownes, as hauing gotten the prime place of beauty by conqueſt.
                  Beleeue me Madame, anſwered our Knight, the way you purpoſe to paſſe, is greatly to be doubted, and you muſt needes goe through ſo many ſtraunge Countries, as trauaile may be very offenſiue to you, and diminiſh much of that goodly feature, and liuely colour, wherewith Nature hath moſt liberally enriched you. So that by gaining in the one, you may (perhaps) loſe in the other; wherefore, conſideration is very requiſite, before repentance enſue too late.
                  Sir, ſaid ſhee, counſell is already taken, and my reſolution certainely ſet downe: for, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer may happen, I am not able to be altered, without ſpare of gold, ſiluer, paine or perill any way enſuing. And whereas you ſay, that we muſt paſſe through many ſtrange Lands; the Sea (in this caſe) can beſt releeue vs, as I haue learned by Maiſter Eliſabet.
                  
                  Well then Madame (quoth he) take order for your other affaires, and let vs part hence when you pleaſe. That ſhall be (ſaid ſhe) ſo ſoone as wee may; in the meane while, bee no way iniurious to your ſelfe, but paſſe the time as pleaſantly as you can: for I haue Hawkes, Hounds and Huntſmen to yeeld you pleaſure; and therefore I would aduiſe you, this day to chaſe the Hart, Hinde, or nimble Roe, or any other game that may beſt delight you. Whereto hee willingly gaue conſent, ſo that after dinner, our Knight, accompanied with many Lords and Gentlmen, rode into the Forreſt.
                  There they met with great ſtore of wilde beaſts, who being well nere ſpent with running, made backe againe vpon the purſuing Houndes. But as our Knight earneſtly followed a Hart, which had eſcaped from the toyles, both hee and Gandalin were ſtrayed ſo far into the woods, as they were enforced to ſpend the whole night there, by not knowing how to recouer againe their way of entrance. And as they traced from one ſide to another, at length they came neere to a very beautifull Fountaine, enuironed round about with trees of ſuch heighth, as it was impoſſible (almoſt) to meet with taller. There they reſolued to abide till the next morning; wherefore, alighting from their horſes, they firſt watered them, and after tooke off their bridles to let them graze.
                  And becauſe our Knight could not ſo ſoone betake himſelfe to reſt, hee walked along vnder the faire-ſpreading trees, and diſcerned ſomewhat neere him a white horſe lye dead, all couered with freſh-bleeding woundes, which hee had l
                        •
                     tely receiued. Moreouer,

he heard the voyce of a man complayning very lamentably, as one that felt intollerable paine and anguiſh: but being vnable to diſcerne from whence it proceeded, by reaſon that the night was ſo darke and cloudie, he drew as neere to the clamour as he could, to liſten the cauſe why he thus complayned. Then the voyce ſeemed louder to his attention then before, and he could eaſily vnderſtand the deliuery of theſe ſpeeches.
                  Ab miſerable man, vnfortunate Bruneo de bonne Me: now thou doſt too plainly perceiue, that thou art enforced to finiſh thy dayes, and all thy affectionate deſires, wherewith thy loyall heart hath beene ſo long time afflicted. Ah Amadis de Gaule, my worthy Lord, neuer more ſhalt thou ſee thy faithfull companion Bruneo: for in the queſt of thee, according as thy well-beloued Siſter Melicia commanded me; I fell into the hands of Traytours, who haue wrought my death, without the ayd or ſuccour of any friend to helpe me. O vnkinde Fortune, vtter enemy to my felicity, thou haſt throwen me ſo farre off from all remedy, as I haue not ſo much as the meanes, whereby I might make knowen my diſaſter to any one, that ſhould reuenge my wrongs, which were no meane comfort to mee, in this wofull caſe, and the more contentedly would my poore ſoule part out of this wretched world. Ah Melicia, floure and mirrour of all vertuous perfections, this night thou loſeſt the moſt loyall ſeruant that euer Lady or Gentle-man had, for my whole life-time was deuoutly dedicated, onely to obey and pleaſe you in all faithfull ſeruices.
                  And vpon my ſoule, if you well conſider it, perhaps you will finde this leſſe extreame for you, being aſſured, that you ſhall neuer meete with any other, ſo conſtant to you, as your Bruneo: Now doth the lampe of my life beginne to burne dimbe, and my afflicted heart loſeth all his forces, wherewith (by your remembrance onely) I haue heeretofore performed many manly deedes of Armes and Chiualrie.
                  Now therefore, I muſt needes recommend it to you, entreating you ſo to fauour and reſpect it, as neuer ſinning againſt you in loyaltie. Death, that hath ſeazed on me, thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe too ſharp and rigorous to me, in robbing me of all my happines, all my ioy and pleaſure in one inſtant. Nor doe I expreſſely blame thee, for depriuing me of my life: but becauſe thou couldſt not permit mee before my death, to accompliſh the charge impoſed by Melicia on me, which was, to find out her brother Amadis.
                  
                  Heere he pauſed awhile but preſently proceeded on againe thus. Alas, this commaund was the very firſt that euer ſhe did put me in truſt withall; and now (as I too plainly perceiue) muſt bee the laſt alſo. Whereby I feele a double torment: for, if I could haue had the meanes to ſatisfie her heerein, my trauaile, (though ending in death) I ſhould haue eſteemed happy. And that, (deare Miſtreſſe) is my chiefeſt affliction, that my dayes are cut off, before I had the power to acknowledge the infinitie of gracious fauours by you beſtowed on me: but reſt you well aſſured, and on my ſoul I proteſt it, that I neuer ſtood in feare of death, in whoſe face I haue oftentimes hazarded my fortunes; but grieue to finiſhe my life thus, in louing you too affectionately.
                  Then a heart-breaking ſigh interrupted

his ſpeech, which yet againe he quickly recouered, ſaying: Ah my deare friend Angriote Eſtrauaux, where art thou now? how haſt thou forſaken me? Thou haſt maintained this queſt with mee a long time together, and now (in need) haſt left me, not affording mee any comfort or ſuccour. And yet I haue little reaſon to blame thee; becauſe my ſelfe was the meanes of our ſeparation this day, to both our great misfortunes, that ſundered vs from euer meeting any more.
                  Then began he to ſigh extremely, and the coldneſſe of his ſtomack breaking foorth many hicko
                        •…
                      among innumerable ſighes, made a ſtrange confuſion of his words 
                        •
                     ollowly vttered. In regard whereof our Knight, who had well vnderſtood all theſe wofull complaints, could not refrain from teares: neuertheleſſe▪ going (at laſt) to the place where he lay, he thus ſpake to him. My kind friend Bruneo, what diſmall miſhap hath thus befalne thee? I pray thee be of good cheare, and put thy truſt in our Lord God, who hath done ſo much both for thee and me, as to conduct mee to this place, where I will compaſſe ſome meanes to helpe thee. Bruneo conceipted in himſelfe, that theſe wordes came from his Squire Laſinde, whom he had ſent to ſeeke ſome Religious man, by whom hee might be confeſt before his death; wherefore he thus anſwered. Alas my deare Laſinde, thou haſt tar

                     d too long, for I feele my fainting in ſuch forwardneſſe, that I cannot accompliſh now what I purpoſed. Therefore, let me entreate thee, that ſo ſoone as my ſoule hath forſaken this her ſad habitation, thou wouldſt returne into Gaule, to faire Melicia: whom when thou haſt acquainted with my miſchance, preſent her the rightſleeue of my ſhirt, thus tincturde in my true heartblood, and ſeauen letters foulded vp therein, which I haue alwayes hitherto kept as carefully, as mine own life. And becauſe ſtrength fayleth me, doe thou ſupply out the reſt that ſhould be ſaid, aſſuring her, that the griefe ſhe will conceiue for my misfortune, by thinking her ſelfe to be the cauſe thereof, ſending me in ſearch of her Brother Amadis, did more torment me, then any torture elſe could doe.
                  Why, how now deare friend? anſwered our knight, doeſt thou thinke me to be Laſinde thy Squire? why man, I am thy companion Amadis, for whoſe ſake thou art falne into this great danger. Therefore, take heart man, be of good comfort, and I will bring thee to ſo worthy a man, as ſhall reſtore thee to health againe very ſpeedily. Now, albeit Bruneo was ſo weake, by the great aboundance of blood which he had loſt, as hee was no longer able to ſpeake▪ yet knowing Amadis by his voyce, and ſeeing him ſo neere him, hee

                     ingling the teares together that fell from their eyes; which was performed in ſuch ſort, as they that had beheld them, would haue thought, they had ſeene one ſoule diuided, betweene two moſt louing and intimate friends. And as they were thus compaſſionating each other, Gandalin (who had all this

ſweet hearbs at more eaſe.
                  By this time the breake of day beganne to appeare, and our knight commaunded Gandalin, to go finde Maiſter Eliſabet with all poſſible ſpeed: beſide, to entreate Madame Graſinda, to ſend thither (with him) a ſoft horſe-litter, for conueying Bruneo to her Palace. Gandalin heerein was ſo diligent, that hee made a very ſpeedie returne, bringing Maſter Eliſabet thither with him: who ſeeing the two friendes thus diſconſolate, and making much moane each to other, he ſaid: Good my Lords, feare not any thing; for, by the grace and helpe of God, I wil prouide whatſoeuer is needfull. Then viſiting the wounds of Bruneo, he found them ſhut and cloſed, by reaſon of the nights extreame coldnes: notwithſtanding, hee applied ſuch excellent ointments to them, as before they parted thence, his paine was well appeaſed, and he fell faſt aſleep, which gaue vndoubted hope to Maiſter Eliſabet, that the worſt of daunger was paſt; whereof when he had aduertiſed our knight, no newes could be more comfortable to him.
                  As thus they ſate expecting their ſicke friends awaking, they eſpied a man comming towards them, carying the heades of two Knights at his ſaddle bow, and holding an Axe in his hand all bloody. He ſeeing ſo many ſit there together, grew fearefull: but our Knight of the Greene Sword knowing him to be Laſinde, the loyall Squire to Don Bruneo, aroſe, (accompanied onely with Gandalin) to meete him. This made the Squire much more timorous, and perceiuing them thus comming towards him, he turned bridle to fly away. After him followed our Knight, running into a very deepe bottome or vallie, where the thicknes of the brakes & buſhes, hindred him from ſight of the Squire, wherfore he cryed ſo loud as hee could. Whither flieſt thou Laſinde? ſtay many, for I am one of thy friends. When Laſinde heard himſelfe named, he turned his face, and preſently knew Amadis: wherefore, alighting from his horſe, moſt humbly he ſaluted him, ſaying. Alas my Lord, doe not you know the heauy newes of my good Maſter, who lies ſlaine in this Forreſt?
                  At ſpeaking theſe words, he made moſt pittifull lamentation, and then began again thus. Surely Sir, you wil not thinke what trauaile he hath endured, onely in the ſearch of you, ſo earneſt was his deſire to find you: which would to God he had done, before this great misfortune befell him, by the villainous treachery of two traytors, whoſe heades you may heere behold, not long ſince deliuered mee by Angriote Eſtrauaux. He gaue me expreſſe command, to preſent them to my Lord if hee were liuing: if not, to lay them ſo neere to his dead body as I could, that the world might witneſſe iuſt reuenge taken on them. Laſinde, anſwered our Knight, he is liuing, thankes bee giuen to God for it, and I left him vnder yonder trees, in better diſpoſition then thou imagineſt. Notwithſtanding, hee is yet ſo feeble, by his great expence of blood, as he could not declare how, or by whom hee was thus wronged: and if thou wilt follow me, thou ſhalt finde him in no worſe eſtate then I tell thee.
                  But beware (vpon thy life) that before any whoſoeuer, thou call me none other, then the Knight of the Greene Sword. It ſhall bee done Sir, quoth the Squire, ſeeing it is your pleaſure ſo to command me.
                  
                     
Come thou then with Gandalin, replyed our Knight, and I will haſte thither before, becauſe I would haue no man to know, that I haue ſpoken with thee
                        •
                     , therefore remember what thou haſt in charge.
                  Away goes our Knight, leauing Gandalin and Laſinde together, returning towardes Bruneo, where (ſoone after) both the Squires arriued alſo. Laſinde made a low reuerence to the Knight of the Greene Sword; and, as if he had neuer ſeene him, ſaid: Bleſſed be the houre (my Lord) that conducted you hither ſo happily, to meere with my good Maſter Bruneo, who in the queſt of you, hath beene ſo abuſed, as now your owne eyes are teſtimonies of his extremitie. Friend Laſinde, anſwered our Knight, thou art wel-come, and I pray thee tell me, what fortune drew him and thee hither, and by whom came hee thus wounded? My Lord, that you ſhall know preſently: giue me but leaue firſt to ſpeake to him.
                  Now was Bruneo awaked from his ſound ſleepe, and felt himſelfe in indifferent diſpoſition: wherefore they admitted Laſinde to come neere him, ſpeaking thus. Sir, your kinde companion Angriote Eſtrauaux, hath ſent you the two Traytours heads, whom he fought withall, and ſlew, knowing what iniury they had done to you. And he is gone to a Monaſtery of Ladies in this Forreſt, to ſtenche the bleeding of a wound, which hee receiued in his right legge, and there hee will make no long abyding, but intendeth to ſee you aliue, or dead.
                  I pray GOD (quoth Bruneo) that hee will defend him from all euill: but how couldſt thou finde me out in this Deſart place, ſo farre eſtranged from all reſort? Sir, ſaid the Squire, Angriote commanded me, to goe directly to that part of the wood, where I ſhould diſcerne the tauleſt trees: becauſe hee vnderſtood by the Traytours them-ſelues, that there they had wounded you to death, which vrged him to ſuch extreme ſorrow, as no mans could be more.
                  Before God, replyed the Knight of the Greene Sword, it were great pitty, that Angriote ſhould ſuffer any wrong: for he is a man of eſpeciall merit, and one that I would very gladly ſee. Therefore Laſinde, conduct mee (if thou canſt) where hee is, while Gandalin, and theſe other, conuey thy Maiſter to ſuch a place, where I know he ſhall be moſt kindly welcome.
                  So they layed him gently in the Litter, and our Knight put on the Armes of Bruneo, bruiſed and battered as they were, and he rode with the Squire into the Forreſt, where they had not trauailed long together, but they eſpied Angriote come ryding towardes them, with his lookes deiected to the ground, like to a man very ſad and melancholly. Behind him they ſaw foure knights alſo, making haſte after him, all well armed and mounted, purſuing amaine vpon the ſpurre, and crying out ſo loud as they could: Turne, turne thee Traytour, for thou muſt leaue thy head behinde thee, in reuenge of both theirs, whom thou haſt treacherouſly ſlaine, being men of much more deſert then thy ſelfe. At this crye, Angriote turned backe, and prepared for his owne defence; which our Knight of the Greene Sword perceiuing, he gaue his horſe the ſpurre, and, before any blow was ſmitten, came among them, ſaying to Angriote, who had not till then ſeene him▪
                     
To them, my noble companion, to them, and feare not, but heauen will defend thee in all extreamities.
                  Much amazed, but yet greatly comforted was Angriote, ſeeing the Knight of the Green Sword, whom (by notice of his Armes) he imagined to be Bruneo; and as he purpoſed to make him anſwer; our knight ranne againſt his enemies, meeting firſt with Brandaſidel, (hee that formerly would haue forced him, to ride with his face backward, to the horſe tayle, & compell him to come to Graſinda, who thought him to be the moſt abſolute Knight in al the Iſlands of Romania, as already you haue heard;) but his Launce gaue him ſuch a ſound ſalutation betweene his Helmet and the Cuirats, as caried him quite out of his ſadle, and there hee lay entranced on the ground. The other three charged Angriote all together, againſt whom he maintained his cauſe ſo ſtoutly, as his courage gaue perfect apparance of it ſelfe. And now beganne the fight betweene two to three, manfully performed on either ſide: but in the end, our knight of the greene Sword, and Angriote had ſuch aduantage, as they were glad to turne their backes, becauſe the beſt man among them all, fell down to the ground. Which the other two beholding, they were quite out of heart; and flying thwart the Forreſt, as Fortune beſt guided them, the one chaunced into a ma
                        •
                     iſ
                        •
                     e, where hee was drowned, while Angriote hewed the other in pieces.
                  This being done, hee purpoſed to follow his companion, whom ſtill hee conceiued to be Bruneo: albeit his ſtroakes and rare Chiualry vrged a contrary ſuſpition, and hee knew not what to imagine, till hee beheld Amadis returning towards him, who had then put off his Helmet to take the aire, by which means Angriote knew him. Then, as one much amazed, he rode to him, and ſtretching forth his armes, louingly embraced him, ſaying. My worthy Lord, what high good happe befell me to meet you ſo luckily: conſidering, that but by your aſſiſtance, I had doubtleſſe bin dead. By my faith Sir (quoth our Knight) you owe many thankes to Laſinde, who was the cauſe of our happy meeting for he perſwaded me, that you were gone to a neere adioyning Monaſterie, for cure of a wound receiued in your legge. Indeed Sir, (ſaid Angriote) ſuch was my determination, and thitherward I went, till theſe Traytours came to aſſaile me: But know you what is become of Brunco? I am perſwaded, hee is either dead, or in very great daunger. Be of good cheare man (replyed our Knight) I hope his greateſt perill is paſt: for I lately left him, in the ca
                        •
                     e of one of the beſt Chirurgions in the world.
                  Then he reported, in what maner he found him, and what complaints he made, exſpecting nothing elſe but death; whereby I perfectly vnderſtand (quoth hee) what tedious trauailes you both haue endured, onely in the ſearch of me, for which (while I liue) I ſtand highly obliged to you. I would it were in my power (quoth Angriote) to let you know how much more I could find in my heart to doe for you: then ſhould you well perceiue, that this which you pleaſe to terme trauaile, is nothing elſe but pleaſure and delight to me.
                  And let me tell you, that I liue not, but onely by your meanes: for you holpe me to the wife, which I haue now married, without whoſe

comfort I had no longer breathed. Leaue we this talke, ſaid our knight, till ſome fitter time, and let vs goe ſee, whether yonder diſmounted varlets bee dead or no, or elſe to put them out of their paine.
                  So they returned to the place of encounter, and found one of them offering to riſe: but the Knight of the Green Sword going neere him, made a proffer to ſmite him, ſaying. Trayterous villaine, how du
                        •
                     ſt thou (vpon no occaſion) aſſault any Knight errant, that neuer did thee the leaſt diſpleaſure? Confeſſe the truth, or elſe thou dieſt. Before God Sir, (
                        ••
                     ſwered Angriote) this is one of them, that ſo cruelly wounded our friend Brunco, and to prooue it true, I left him with him, and two other Knights beſide, that came to ſeeke ſuccour for their Siſter (as they ſaid) that ſhould bee burned moſt ſhamefully. But them-ſelues (afterward) confeſſed the treaſon to me, in returning from a place, where (at the ſame inſtant) I was deſired, to deliuer the Son of an ancient Knight, who was kept priſoner by diuers villaines. Which I did, ſetting him at libertie, and impriſoning the other in his ſteed; by which occaſion, I and Bruneo were ſundered, whom ſince I neuer ſaw. Is not this true? ſpeake wretch: but hee anſwered not a word, lying ſtill, with his eyes faſt fixed on the ground.
                  Heereupon, the Knight of the Greene Sword called to Laſinde, ſaying; Alight from thy horſe, and ſmite off his head. Laſinde preſently diſmounted, and as he lifted vp his arme to ſtrike, the other cried out. Alas Sir, for Gods ſake take pitty on me, and I will tell you the trueth inſtantly. Make haſte then, (ſaid Angriote) or another ſhall bee haſtier with thee, then thou wouldſt haue him to be. Then (by litle and litle) hee began to relate what had happened, ſaying.
                  Vnderſtand my Lords, I and my companions being aduertiſed, that two Knights errant, were newly arriued in this Country, to enquire after the knight of the Greene Sword, we reſolued to kill them, as thinking by that meanes, to doe diſpleaſure to him whom they deſired to finde, becauſe we hate him deadly. And in regard wee feared to ſet on them both together, we deuiſed to ſunder them, by miſinforming them, as already you haue heard. But when we came to the Fountaine of the high Beeches, he whom we conducted, in pretence of deliuering the condemned Lady, ſuffered his horſe to water there: and as hee let looſe the reynes of his bridle, we ran vpon him, giuing him ſo many hurts with our Swords and Axes, before hee had the leaſt meanes of defending himſelfe) that he fell down dead, as we ſuppoſed, for he appeared not to moue any limbe.
                  Villaine, (anſwered Amadis) durſt thou commit ſuch deteſtable treaſon, vnder colour of thy hatred to me? How Sir, quoth the other, are you the Knight of the Greene Sword? Looke villaine, ſaid Amadis, and ſee it heere hanging by my ſide. Then Sir, quoth the other, you may partly hold me excuſed, becauſe what I haue done, was by the perſwaſion of a kinſeman of mine, whom you haue ſlaine, and heere you may behold him lying at my feete. A yeare is not yet fully expired, ſince he receiued by you, the greateſt ſhame that any man could haue, and his name was Brandaſidel, whom I know not whether you remember as yet, or no. You made him mount vpon his horſe, with his face backward and to hold the taile

in ſteed of a bridle, with his Shield renuerſed, and ſo preſented him to Graſinda.
                  
                  Heereat hee conceiued ſuch diſpleaſure, that in meere malice to you, he enuied all other knights errant, as wee did the like in loue to him. Thus haue I declared the whole truth to you, and humbly entreate you, (without any reſpect to mine offence) to graunt mee mercy, beyond all merit.
                  Our Knight beganne to be compaſſionate, anſwering. The mercy thou ſhalt haue, is not to abridge the puniſhment thou haſt iuſtly deſerued: but in hope that thou wilt become an honeſter man hereafter, then hitherto thou haſt bin, in this regard thy life is ſpared. But if thou fall to thine old byas, aſſure thy ſelfe, time will fitte me with a ſharper reuenge, r then now I can or will take on thee, So leauing him, they rode directly towardes the Towne: and falling from one diſcourſe to another, our knight demanded of Angriote, what newes he had brought out of Great Brittaine? He reſolued him all things that hee could, and told him (among other matters) that a reuerend Hermite, named Naſcian, had giuen King Liſuart one of the very goodlieſt young Gentlemen, that euer was ſeene: whom he recouered (in his ſwadling clothes) out of the teeth of a Lionneſſe, carying him for food to her young ones: Alſo how the Queene had giuen him to the Princeſſe Oraina, to ſerue her (quoth he) with my Sonne Ambor: but there is very great difference betweene them, becauſe Ambor is mightily deformed, and the other an incomparable creature. You may (quoth Amadis) report of your Sonne as you pleaſe, but if hee carry reſemblance with his Father, he wil proue a man of extraordinary merit. To women let vs leaue beauty and faire feature, who are curious and inquiſitiue after ſuch nicities: & would to God your Sonne were of age to follow me, then ſhould I require him of you, and that very earneſtly, to keepe company with Gandalin, on whom I purpoſe to beſtow knighthood, ſo ſoone as I ſhall returne into Gaule. Truſt mee Sir, ſaid Angriote, Gandalin doth well deſerue much at your hands, and if my Sonne were ſo happy as you wiſh him, my hopes would mount farre higher, then as yet they can doe.
                  Falling from this, into other talke, Amadis demaunded, how long ſince he and Bruneo had iourneyed together? Since our departure from Great Brittaine, anſwered Angriote, we neuer abandoned one anothers company, for any fight or Combat whatſoeuer could happen, till yeſterday: and yet notwithſtanding, we haue ended many ſtraunge and dangerous aduentures, albeit (all of them) inferiour to your high fortune, againſt that deuiliſh Monſter Endriagus, according as wee haue thereof bin aduertiſed. Wherfore I beſeech you to let me vnderſtand, how, and in what maner you fought together.
                  We muſt referre that, replyed Amadis, till ſome more apt and conuenient leyſure, becauſe we now are neere to the Towne, and that will require a much larger diſcourſe, then the ſhortneſſe of the way will permit vs.
                  By this time they were arriued at Granſidaes Palace, who hauing heard tydings of their comming, came very kindly to welcome them, conducting them to the Chamber where Bruneo lay, who beganne to finde himſelfe better and better, by

ſuch good meanes as Maſter Eliſabet had vſed to him. But when hee ſaw them all three ſo well met together, he was not a little ioyfull, praiſing God for ſuch a fortunate ſucceſſe.
                  And as they parled on their paſſed aduentures, our Knight of the Greene Sword, declared to them, the promiſe which he had made to Graſinda, and what ſhipping ſhee prepared for paſſage into Great Brittaine: whereof they were all exceeding ioyfull, in regard of their long-deſired returne thither. In the meane while, Bruneo grew to able ſtrength, and being in diſpoſition to endure the Seas: all things weare readily fitted for the voyage; Graſinda and they going aborde, with ſuch a conuenient company as was thought meet.
                  So hoyſing ſayle, they launched foorth▪ into the Deepe, where they were ſo aſſiſted by ſucceſſefull windes, as (in very few dayes) they loſt all ſight of the Iſlands of Romania.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. XIII.
                  
                     How the Queene Sardamira, with the other Embaſſadours from the Emperour Patin, arriued at the Court of King Liſuart, hoping (at their returne) to beare thence the Princeſſe Oriana with them: And of that which happened to certaine Romane Knights, offering iniury to a Knight errant.
                  
                  
                     THe Embaſſadors from the Emperour Patin, being come to King Liſuarts Court: they were entertayned by him moſt honourably, hauing vnderſtood the occaſion, that drew them from Italie into Great Brittaine. After audience graunted to their Embaſſie, he told them, that he would call a Councell of all his Lords together, and then they ſhould haue an anſwere: yet hee gaue them this comfort, that hee made no doubt, but they ſhould returne to the Emperour their Maſters contentment. At this time was not Oriana in the Court; for, hauing vnderſtood the cauſe of their comming, ſhe feigned her ſelfe ſick, to auoyde all meanes of ſpeaking with them, and therfore was retired to Mirefleur.
                  
                  The Queene Sardamira, vpon this hopefull procraſtination, determined to go ſee the Princeſſe, making her intention knowen to the King: who liked well 
                        •…
                     of, and for her better conuoy, gaue the good olde Knight Grumedan charge of her. On the morrow following, ſhee ſet forth from the Court, to let the Princeſſe vnderſtand, how the Emperour affected her dearely, how honourably hee would receiue her, and what rare ſingularities ſhee ſhould ſee in Rome. But herein ſhe was much deceiued, becauſe her very meere remembrance of Amadis, gaue her more ſweete content in ſoule, then any thing elſe in the world could doe.
                  Now was the ſeaſon of the yeare exceedingly hot, in which regard, the Queene (for her better refreſhing on the way) ſent diuers of her ſeruants before, to pitch her Tents neere a little Riuer, that ran along within three miles of Mirefleure. There ſhe alighted, accompanied

with Grumedan, and many Lords, Ladies and Gentlewomen of her owne country; among whom were fiue Romaine Knights, who imagined ſo well of themſelues, as none in Great Brittaine could come neere them. Being within their Tents, their fiue Shields were hanged without at the entrance, and their Launces likewiſe leaning againſt them: which was a ſignall (according to the cuſtome obſerued among Knights errant or trauayling) that no one might paſſe by before them, without triall of the Combate, and theſe enſtructions they receiued from Grumedan. To whom they made anſwere, that they would eſſay themſelues againſt thoſe of Great Brittaine, to let them well know: that they had better skill then they, both in breaking a Launce, and handling a Sword. We ſhall ſee (replied Grumedan) how it will goe with you: and yet I dare aſſure yee, there may ſome ſuch paſſe 
                        〈◊〉
                     , as will finde yee worke enough to doe.
                  As thus they held on their diſcourſe, they eſpied (a farre off) a Knight comming, which was the gentle Prince Floreſtan, who (in vaine) had trauayled through many countries, to finde his Brother Amadis. And now (very penſiuely) hee was riding to King Liſuarts Court, hoping to heare ſome better news, by the Romaines that ſo lately came thether, as had beene told him by the way: and ſeeing the Tents there erected, he rod toward them, to vnderſtand who was within them. He happened to a Pauillion, the linnen walls whereof were high exalted, that the cooleneſſe of the freſh ayre, might the better be conuayed to the Ladies within, who ſate deuiſing together on pretty and pleaſing purpoſes. Floreſtan ſat leaning vppon his Launce, regarding the Ladies very earneſtly, yet not deliuering ſo much as one word becauſe his thoughts were otherwiſe buſied: which cauſed one of the Ladies to ſpeake ſomewhat roughly to him, in this manner. Beleeue mee, Sir Knight, me thinkes you ſhew your ſelfe very vnmannerly, to appeare thus boldly before ſo many great Ladies as are heere preſent, not vſing any reuerence at all to them. But perhaps there Shieldes heere hung vp, called you hether, to declare more duty towards their Maiſters, then you would ſeeme to owe to vs. In good faith, Gentlewoman (anſwered Floreſtan) you haue great reaſon thus to check me: and yet let me tell yee, mine eyes were ſo ſeriouſly buſied in behoulding ſuch bright beauties, as quite bereſt my bodies faculties, and made them fall into this offence. Therefore, moſt humbly I entre at you all together, to pardon this great neglect in mee, for which I will make amends as you ſhall pleaſe to appoint me.
                  The Ladie would not ſo giue him ouer, but ſaid, pardon is to be deſired, after the mends is made, and not before, with all my heart Lady (aunſwered he) prouided, that you interdict not my iouſting againſt your Knights, or elſe command them, to hang vp their Shields within your Tent. How Sir (quoth ſhe) doe you imagine, that they hang heere vpon no ſtronger condition, but to be taken downe ſo lightly? Perſwade your ſelfe, before their Maiſters can be thereto vrged, they are abſolutely determined; to conquer other, from ſuch errant Knights as ſhall paſſe this way, to triumph ouer them afterward in Rome, whether

they intend to beare them, with their names vpon them, to whom they appe
                        ••
                     ained. (Wherefore, if you ſhunne falling into ſuch ineuitable daunger: let me perſwade you to depart hence, with ſo much haſt as poſſibly you can make. In good ſadneſſe Madame, aunſwered Floreſtan, although I finde little friendſhip, and haue farre leſſe knowledge of you: yet will I not follow your councell, nor ſtand in feare of the ſhame you ſpeake of. But in ſteed of my Shield, which they may hope to beare with them to Rome: I will haue all theirs, and ſend them to the Firme or Encloſed Iſle, to beautifie the place, among many other that are there already.
                  As thus he ſpake, hee made an humble reuerence to the Ladies, and ſo rod towards the other Pauillions. Grumedan had heard all this diſcourſe betweene the Knight and the Ladies, which made him ſuddenly preſume, that he was ſome kinſman to noble Amadis: and it mounted his ſpirits very iocondly, with a hopefull perſwaſion, that he would qualifie the ouer daring pride of the Romaines, who (vpon opinion of their owne worthineſſe) contemned all other nations in the world. Comming forth of his Tent, he beheld him to handle the Shildes each after the other, and that in ſuch manner, as daring their Maiſters to come to the louſt: afterward he with drew thence, croſſing ouer the little riuer, in expectation of them that had any quarell againſt him. The fiue Romaine Knights mounted on horſebacke, intending all together to ſet vpon him: but Grumedan ſtayed them in this manner, ſaying.
                  How Lords? would you offer to breake honorable cuſtome, and combate fiue againſt one Knight onely? you ought to goe one after another, according as your Shields haue beene touched: and remember your ſelues well, for by the Knights outward appearance, hee will not eaſilie be put to diſgrace. Lord Gramedan, anſwered Gradamor, wee Romaines differ very farre from you, becauſe you commend, before the deed be done, and we, after it is effected: and let me tell yee, you will hardly finde any Knight equall to vs. I know not (replied Grumedan) what they are whom you talke of, and hold in ſuch high eſtimation: but if I were to deale with any of you, that offered me the very leaſt iniury: I ſhould hope to looſe no honour thereby. Grumedan, Grumedan, anſwered Gradamor, you haue a good conceite of yourſelfe, and I could wiſh (though it did coſt me my fayreſt fortune) that we two were now as ready one for another: as I ſhall quickely be for him, that is ſo boldly come hether to ſeeke his owne ſhame. And yet I feare it will neuer fall to my turne; becauſe hee whoſe Shield he firſt handled, will handle him with ſuch ſeuere chaſtiſement, as I ſhall not need to diſplay mine arme againſt him.
                  Here at Grumedan ſmiled, ſaying. Well Sir. take heed you hap not into the hazard, for many times it comes to paſſe; that they who thinke to vanquiſh others, are disfauoured and foyled themſelues by fortune, who neuer was friend to the preſumptuous. I vnderſtand you well (ſaid Gradamor) and that thus we may conteſt heere till it be night. So, going to him whoſe Shield was firſt toucht, he ſaid. Goe my deare companion, and make it apparantly knowne, what difference there is betweene well ſpeaking, and bad

doing. Be confident in me, replied the other, I am not made for prating enterparlaunce, and neuer let any account be had of me: if (at our very firſt ſhock) I make him not meaſure his length on the ground; except he deliuer me his Shield, and his horſe to you Lord Grumedan, which I perceiue is very faire and goodly. So croſſing the riuer, and placing his Launce in his reſt, hee ran againſt Floreſtan, and Floreſtan againſt him, but fayled of breaking their Launces: neuertheleſſe, they met with their Shields and bodies together ſo mainely, as the Romaine (being leſſe expert then the other) was caſt downe from his horſe, and breaking his arme in the fall, lay all along ſo am azedly confounded, as hee was able to moue neither hand or foote.
                  Herevpon, Floreſtan cryed out to his owne Squires, to ſtay the horſe, which ran about the field, and and to take the Shield from about the Knights neck and hang it vp vpon a tree, where hee poynted him. Then returning to the place where he began his courſe, he attended for a ſecond man, to ſuccour his companion, who very ſoone after preſented himſelfe. But if the firſt found a curſt entertainement; this other met with one much worſe, for Floreſtan gaue him ſuch a wel-come with his Launce: that it entred quite through his Shield, coate of Maile; and pierced farre into the fleſh, ſo that his girts braking, by ſtrength of the encounter, he tumbled ouer and ouer, with the horſes ſaddle betweene his legges, and hauing perfected his race, Floreſtan turned back againe, ſaying. By my faith, Knight, the Saddle ſhall be yours, but the horſe mine, vpon condition: that (hereafter) you publiſh your proweſſe in the Capitoll of Rome, in what manner you attempted, and how you ſped.
                  Theſe words were ſo audibly deliuered, as the Ladies might eaſily vnderſtand them: which pleaſed Grumedan ſo highly, that hee ſaid to the other Knights. If you ſpeed no better then your companions haue done: I am of the mind, that at your returne to Rome, they need not breake downe any part of the walls, to let in the glory of your triumph. Beleeue it Sir, anſwered Gradamor, before the ſport is ended, you ſhall ſee a contrary turne of chaunce, to his diſaduantage that you make ſo much account of, who (accidentally hath ouer-throwne two of our friendes. I know not (ſaid Grumedan) what may happen, but (for ought I yet ſee) he meanes to defend his Shield manfully, and conquer yours: for cariage of them to the Encloſed Iſle, as he ſaid, not to be placed in ranke of thoſe belonging to loyall loouers, but among ſuch Knights, as left their armes more vpon compalſion, then with their owne good wills. Therefore, it ſtands you now vpon, and that very needfully, to diſplay the ſtrength of your arme, that I be not troubled to day to arme my ſelfe, to defend the honor of our knights, on whom you haue throwne ſuch foule aſpertions, and ſcandalous imputations.
                  At theſe words Gradamor laughed hartely, and nodding his head (as in deriſion) replied Lord Grumedan, it likes you to be pleaſant, and to imagine mee of no more might or courage, then to combate againſt your brauing ſpeeches: bewell aſſured, that (before day light ſhut in) I ſhall make you to repent them. I heare you ſay ſo, anſwered Grumedan: but hee that hath begun to feaſt your fellowes will dreſſe a

better diſh for you before it bee night, very much offended was the Queene Sardamira, to heare Gradamor conteſt thus vpon no occaſion. In this time, Floreſtan had recouered the downe-caſt Knights horſe, and hung his Shield vp by the other. Then returning to his firſt place, and taking a new Lance, hee ſtayed the comming of another.
                  Then came forth the third knight, who, with a ſtearne countenance, ſhooke his ſtaffe ſo ſtrongly, as if he would haue doubled it together, and giuing the ſpurres to his horſe, ranue againſt Floreſtan. But Floreſtan (who was one of the moſt actiue Knights in the world) met him with ſuch direct encounter on the Helmet, that it fell off from his head; and the ſhocke was ſo violent, as, if he had not quickly caught hold about his horſe necke, hee had falne to the ground. Then turning bridle, he tooke his Launce by the ſteele head, intending to ſmite him with the great end thereof: but hee turned aſide from the blow, couering himſelfe with his Shield, wheron Floreſtan caught ſuch faſt hold, that he core it from his neck, beating him ſo often about the pace, as hee was enforced to fall downe. Where Floreſtan left him, crying out, that euery one might heare him. By my faith Knight, it was ill done of you, to beginne ſo badly, with triumphing ouer our Shields at Rome, when yours muſt keepe company with theirs, that I muſt ſend to the Encloſed Iſle. The like ſucceſſe befell to the fourth man, who, in falling from his horſe, brake his legge.
                  Now, there remained none but Gradamor, who continuing ſtill his preſumptuous ſpeeches, ſaid to Grumedan: See you bee ready to anſwere me, ſo ſoone as I haue diſciplinde vonder ſaucie companion, in whoſe behalfe you haue ſpoken ſomewhat too liberally this day: and I if I doe not make you to vnſay thoſe words, let me neuer here after backe a horſe that may bee worthy any thing. That will appeare by and by, replyed Gramedan; but I dare beleeue nothing till I ſee it: and if you come fairly off from the ſtrange Knights entertainement, you and I ſhall haue leyſure to talke together the better.
                  
                     Gradamor would then returne no anſwere, but in a great rage paſſed ouer the Riuer, and cryed to the Knight, to guard himſelfe. Then Floreſtan ranne againſt him; and the ſhocke was ſo violent betweene them both, that Gradamor bended his Shield together: but Floreſtan tooke him at ſuch apt aduantage, that hee threw him quite out of his Saddle, into a quagmine, full of ſtinking ſoyle and dirt. Now I dare ſweare, ſaid Gramedan (ſpeaking then to the Queene) for ought I yet know, I ſhall haue leyſure enough to breathe my ſelfe, wh
                        •…
                      
                     Gradamor haue made cleane his Armour, and recovered another bone to deale with me.
                  Beleeue me Sir (quoth ſhe) he hath but badly maintained thoſe great words which he ſpake to you: but hee did like them, to whom de
                        •
                     
                     ſerued chaſtiſement is due, and therefore you may well hold him excuſed.
                  All this while, Gradamor laboured very painfully, to get himſelfe out of the filthy bogge, wherein he feared leſt he ſhould bee drowned, but at laſt, hee came very fowlly forth, ſo aſhamed of his misfortune, as death could haue bin more wel-come to him. Then 
                        •
                     ooke he off his Helmet, for he was almoſt poisoned with the ſmell of the puddle, as

being no way able to endure it. And as he ſtood to recouer breath Floreſtan (in a mocking manner) ſaid to him. Knight, thou that canſt skill ſo well, of threatning men that thou knoweſt not: if thou canſt handle thy Sword no better then thy Launce, thou art not the man that muſt carry my Shield to Rome, as of late thou madſt thy brag to doe,
                  Before God, anſwered Gradamor, mine arme is yet ſtrong, and my Sword keeue enough, to take reuenge on thee, and the very boldeſt Knight in all Great Brittaine if hee offer mee any iniury: as thou ſhalt preſently perceiue, if thou darſte maintaine the cuſtome of this country againſt mee.
                  Now, albeit Floreſtan was there with much better acquainted, then Gradamor could be, yet he demaunded of him what it was? It is conuenient (quoth hee) and agreeing with the order of Armes, that thou ſhouldſt either reſtore me my horſe, or elſe alight on foote, that our manner of fight may be equall: then, he that ſhall gaine the better, let him deal with his enemy as likes him beſt without any admiſſion of mercy.
                  Truſt me, replied Floreſtan, I will fulfill thine owne deſire: although I am well aſſured, that thou wouldſt not ſhew ſuch courteſie to mee, if thou hadſt mee at the like aduantage, as now I haue thee. But becauſe it were very vnreaſonable, that ſo goodly a Romaine Knight, beeing 
                        •
                     oylde with ſuch filth and dirt, ſhould make his horſein as bad a caſe as hee is himſelfe: I will diſmounte from mine, at thine entreatie. So he alighted on foote, and couerieg himſelfe with his Shield, marched boldly againſt Gradamor, who made no doubt now, but to reuenge his iniury very ſufficiently.
                  The fight began, and continued (for ſome while betweene them) very ſharply and cruell: notwithſtanding, it laſted not long; for Floreſtan (who was one of the moſt skilfull Knights then liuing) brought his enemie to ſuch extremity, that hee drew him ſo farre as to the Queenes Pauilion, where he fell downe, by reaſon of a mighty ſtroke deliuered on the toppe of his Helmet; and lay ſo bere ft of al his ſences, as he could ſtirre neither hand nor foote. Then Floreſtan ſet his foote vpon him, and taking him by the legge, dragde him a long to the miry puddle, whereinto he fell at the firſt: but the Laces of his Helmet chaunced to breake, ſo that it fell off from his head, and the freſh ayre driuing away his trance, gaue him ſight of his imminent danger, which made him craue pardon of Floreſtan, and cry out to the Queene for helpe.
                  By my faith (quoth ſhee to Grumedan) this ſhame and perill is iuſtly falne vpon him: for by the ſame Law which he made him-ſelfe, he muſt now receiue his enacted puniſhment.
                  
                     Floreſtan looking angerly on Gradamor, ſaide vnto him. Canſt thou craue mercie, conſidering what couenant hath paſt betweene vs, and on an edict willingly ſet downe by thy ſelfe? Looke for none other fauor, then what I am bound to, by thy owne conditions. Wretch that I am then, anſwered Gradamor, there now remaines no hope or comfort. No, (quoth Floreſtan) and ſo aſſure thy ſelfe, except thou doeſt two things that I ſhall command thee. Alas Sir, ſaide Gradamor, I am ready to obey you, and to doe whatſoeuer you ſhal enioyne mee. Write then preſently, replyed Floreſtan,
                     
thy name, and thoſe of thy companions, with thine owne blood, vpon theſe Shieldes, and afterward, thou ſhalt know the reſt of my will. Gradamor was in ſuch feare, as hee ſeemed rather dead then aliue: for Floreſtan ſtood with his Sword ſtill ouer him, ready (at a word) to ſmite off his head. Whereupon, he called for one of his ſeruants, to bring him a Penner ſpeedily, and taking foorth a penne, filled it with his owne blood, and ſo perfourmed the commaund of Floreſtan.
                  
                  On horſe-backe mounted hee preſently, and taking a ſtrong Launce from one of his Squires, returned againe to Gradamor, ſaying: Baſe Knight, this Launce was neuer made, but for their reuenge, whom thou haſt hitherto cowardly and iniuriouſly abuſed: thou dieſt thereon inſtantly, except Grumedan entreate mee to ſaue thy life. Alas Sir, quoth Gradamor, hee will neuer doe it.
                  Scarcely had hee finiſhed theſe words, but Floreſtan made a proffer to thruſt it in his throate: which made him fearefully crye out: Ah gentle Knight Grumedan, entreate ſome fauour for mee. At this crye Grumedan came neere, and returned him this anſwere. Beleeue mee knight, your great preſumption hath brought you into this daungerous eſtate: and if he whom you ſo audaciouſly threatned, ſhould ſmite your head off from your ſhoulders, hee did no more then you haue iuſtly deſerued. Neuertheleſſe, for this time, I will deſire him to pardon and forgiue you.
                  Then Floreſtan, turning to Grumedan, ſaid. Lord Grumedan, you haue power to commaund me: and ſeeing it is your will that hee ſhall liue, I am contented to remit him. And therefore, thou Romaine Knight, thanke him for thy life, and remember withall, that ſo ſoone as thou art come to Rome, thou report in the open Senate, what honour all of you haue wonne, againſt the Knights of Great Brittaine, whom (in your common talke) you contemne and deſpiſe. And if your Emperour take delight to heare you ſpeake, bee not neglect, in telling him it often. Becauſe (for my part) I will make knowen to the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, the great liberalitie of you Romaines in this Countrey, by parting ſo lightly with your Armes, Horſes and Shieldes, to men that you know not, and when you are no longer able to defend them.
                  All theſe wordes vttered by Floreſtan, could not procure the leaſt anſwere from Gradamor: but he held downe his head in no meane rage, to ſee himſelfe ſo flouted and ſcornde. Which Floreſtan well perceiuing, to torment him the more, thus againe hee proceeded.
                  For ought I ſee (gentle Cheualier, you may carrie home to your huge Cittie, the huger ouer-weening you brought with you hither: becauſe wee ſillie Knights errant, haue no other care, but of ou
                        •
                      honeſt and courteous behauiour, which you abhorre by birth and cuſtome. Yet if thereby you would compaſſe the affection of your faire friends, let me perſwade you, to trauayle to the Arch of loyall Louers, to make it apparantly knowen, whether you haue as much looue as valour. Perhappes you may thereby winne ſuch honour and glory, as will make you the more eſteemed of your Countrie

men, and encreaſe fauour for yee among your gracious Miſtreſſes; who knowing your former approbation, if they bee women of ſound iudgement, they will not (all their life time) chaunge you for worſe.
                  
                     Grumedan hauing heard all this conference, nothing could better content him, then to ſee theſe proud Romanes thus diſgraced by one Knight onely. On the other ſide, Gradamor was in ſuch tormenting affliction: as (without returning any anſwere to Floreſtan) hee ſaid to Grumedan. I pray you Sir, let mee be carried into one of the Tents: for I feele my ſelfe ſo ill, as it is not poſſible for mee to liue any long while. Selfe doe, ſelfe haue, replyed Grumedan; commaunding the Squires to beare him in, returning afterward to Floreſtan, ſaying.
                  Sir Knight, if it agreed with your good liking, I would gladly know of whence, and what you are, confeſſing my ſelfe therein the more beholding to you: and ſo much the rather, becauſe a man of your eſteem and merit, ought not to conceale his name among his friends. Lord Grumedan (quoth he) you muſt needes pardon me, becauſe I haue ſo highly offended the Queene, and theſe Ladies heere preſent this day, as I would not by any means be known, although their excelling beauties were the onely cauſe thereof. For, ſeeing them all ſo faire, my ſences were ſo tranſported, as I ſate gazing on them, not vſing any ſalutation to them.
                  Therefore, I entreate you to pray them to pardon me, or elſe to take ſuch ſatisfaction of me, as ſhall be liking to themſelues: then ſend me anſwere to the round Hermitage, where I intend to repoſe my ſelfe all this day.
                  Aſſure your ſelfe Sir, anſwered Grumedan, for your ſake, I will preuaile with them ſo far
                        •

                     bt not, but they will bee eaſily conteuted, when they heare how honeſt an offer you make them. I pray you Sir, till me, replied Floreſtan, doe you heare any tidings of Lord Amadis? Heere you muſt obſerue, that Grumedan loued Amadis as dearely, as any man could doe, and the meere remembrance of him, cauſed the teares to trickle downe his reuerend beard, and thus he replyed to Floreſtan: So God mee helpe (gentle Knight) ſince the time that he parted from Gaule, with the King his Father, wee neuer heard what became of him: and be you ſure, that if I could haue knowen anything of him, I ſhould take no ſmall pleaſure in telling it to you, or any that is a friend to him.
                  In good faith, anſwered Floreſtan) I make no doubt of it; for I know you to be ſo loyall, as if all men were of your minde, treaſon or villanie could finde no entertainment among men, as now adayes they doe, and that too commonly.
                  Thus ſpeaking, hee commended him to Gods protection, and Grumedan returned backe to the Ladies: 
                        •
                     ut very ſoone after, hee eſpied one of Floreſtans Squires comming towards him, who ſaluted him from his Maſter, in this manner.
                  Lord Grumedan, my Lord Floreſtan (with whom you conferred ſo lately) hath ſent you this Horſe, belonging ye
                        •
                      while to Gradamor, which he thinkes fit for your ſeruice. And theſe foure other horſes beſide, hee prayes you to preſent them (as his gift) to the Lady,

with whom he had ſome parlance, at his arriuall firſt at theſe Tents. Very ioyfull was Grumedan of this preſent, becauſe it was wonne from the menacing Romaine, but much more io
                        •
                     und in ſoul, when he knew him, that ſent it: to whom hee bare moſt intimat affection, as well in regard of his loue to Amadis, as for the manly valour remaining in him. So, he conducted the Squire, where the Lady was, to whom he thus ſpake. Faire Lady, the Knight that was this day contemned by you, in too many ſeuerall diſgracefull kindes, onely for carrying ouergood opinion of your vanquiſhed Romaines, haue ſent you their foure horſes, and deſires you to beſtow the
                        •
                      on whom you pleaſe.
                  The Lady ſhaping her anſwere to the Squire, replyed thus. Honeſt Friend, thanke your Maſter, and tell him, he had better pleaſde mee in ſending his owne horſe, then all theſe, conquered againſt my minde. Madame, I beleeue you, anſwered the Squire: but they that couet to winne any thing from him, muſt be more bolde and hardy Knights then theſe, of whom, their ſucceſſe makes too pittifull mention. Squire (quoth ſhe) thinke not much, that I wiſhe their honour and profite more, then I doe your Maſters, whom I know not, neither euer ſaw before this day: Neuertheleſſe, now I haue behelde his manly diſpoſition, I grieue that I haue ſpoken any thing to his diſlyking, and will make amends for my raſhneſſe, whenſoeuer hee ſhall plea
                        •
                     e.
                  The Squire tooke his leaue of her and Grumedan, returning towards his Maiſter, that awayted his comming, to whom hee recounted all the diſcourſe betweene him and the Lady: whereat Floreſtan laughed heartily. And cauſing them to take thence the conquered Romaines Shields, hee tooke his way to the Hermitage, determining to ſtay in no place more then one night, vntill he arriued at the Encloſied Iſle; where hee hoped to finde Galuanes, who kept it during the abſence of Amadis, and there hee would leaue the Romanes Armes, according as he had formerly promiſed them.
                  Heere you are to vnderſtand, that ſo ſoone as the Squire parted from the Lady, Grumedan went to conuerſe with the Queene Sardamira, to whom he made knowen, that he who had vanquiſhed her Knights, was Floreſtan, brother to Amadis, and tolde her (beſide) what tokens hee had ſent. How Sir? (quoth ſhee) was this Floreſtan, Sonne to King Perion of Gaule, and the bright Counteſſe of Saladria? Yes truely Madame, anſwered Grumedan, and one of the very worthieſt Knights that I know. I know not (ſaid ſhe) how hee hath carried himſelfe in this Countrie; but heretofore the ſons of the Marqueſſe of Ancona (among whom he frequented in Romania, for the ſpace of three yeares together) haue aſſured mee, that they neuer ſaw a more actiue Knight. Neuertheleſſe, they durſt not (for their liues) ſpeake one word of him before the Emperour, who neuer loued him, neither would endure to heare any thing in his commendation. Madame, ſaid Grumedan, do you know the reaſon of his ſpleene?
                  That I doe (quoth ſhee) it is onely out of his hatred to Amad
                           •
                        s, who is his Brother, and conquered the Encloſed Iſle, concluding all the ſtraunge aduentures there. Which the Emperour had reſerued for him-ſelfe: but Amadis preuented him;

whereat he conceiued ſuch diſpleaſure, as hee would very gladly any way contriue his death.
                  
                     Grumedan ſmyling at theſe words vttered by the Queene, replyed: By my faith Madame, if the Emperor were ſo well aduiſed as hee▪ might be, hee hath more reaſon to loue and reſpect him, in ſauing him from the diſhonour that he might there haue falne into, as many more did, that eſſayed thoſe aduentures, yet none but the good Knight Amadis, could haue the glory of finiſhing them.
                  B
                        •
                     t credite me Madame, this is not the cauſe of his malice to Amadis; but another matter, which I knew long ſince. If you be a kinde Knight, (quoth ſhe) conceale it not from me.
                  Then he declared, what had happened to the Emperour, ſinging his ſuppoſed Loues praiſes, when he found Amadis layed vnder the Tree in the Forreſt, and what words they had together, till it drew on the Combate, as hath beene rehearſed in the ſecond Booke. Why then (ſaid the Queene) I well perceiue, that the occaſion of their hatred is not ſmall, but of much greater nature then I tooke it to be.
               
               
                  CHAP. XIIII.
                  
                     How the Queene Sardamira ſent to entreate Floreſtan, to be her conduct to Mirefleure, to Oriana: Becauſe hee had ſo curſtly handled the Knights that kept her company, as they were able to follow her no further.
                  
                  
                     AS thus the Queene and Grumedan were conferring together, of that which happened to the Emperour Patin, who vnder pretence of loue to her then in thoſe dayes, paſſed from Italie into great Brittaine, to approue his manhood againſt all Knights errant, and to maintaine withall, that her beauty farre exceeded Orianaes, and all other Princeſſes in the world: At laſt he fell into the diſcourſe, (whereof all this while he had beene ſilent) how Amadis handled him in the Forreſt, which the Queene had no little delight in, to heare it thus diſcouered by Grumedan. Among other varietie of talke; at laſt, hee ſaid vnto her: Madame, what meſſage will you ſend to Floreſtan?
                  
                  The Queene heereat was very penſiue, but hauing a while well conſidered with her ſelfe, ſhe thus anſwered. Sir, you ſee in what eſtate my Knights are, as they are neither able to guard themſelues, nor mee: therefore I doe earneſtly deſire, that you and Floreſtan would bee my guides, till ſuch time as I might arriue at Mirefleure. Madame, replyed Grumedan, Floreſtan is ſo abſolute a man, and diſcreetly aduiſed, as hee did neuer deny Lady or Gentlewoman, any thing that they could demaund of him. By much greater reaſon (then) will hee not forget himſelfe to you, conſidering, it will bee pleaſure to him to doe you any ſeruice: and ſo much the rather now, becauſe hee craues pardon of you, for the fault wherein (he thinkes) hee hath offended you. Let me entreat you then good Sir, anſwered the Queene, to lend

mee one of your Squires, for conduct of this Gentlewoman to him, by whom I will giue him to vnderſtand my will.
                  Heereto Grumedan condiſcended, and preſently they departed thence with Letters of credence, importing the pleaſure of her Miſtreſſe. So long rode ſhee and the Squire together, that they came to the Hermitage, where they found Floreſtan, who inſtantly took knowledge of the Gentlewoman: for it was ſhe that ſo checkt him at the Queenes Pauillion; neuertheleſſe, he welcomde her very graciouſly, and ſhe (in ſaluting him) vſed theſe words. Sir Knight, at a certaine houre of this day, I little thought of any command, to come and finde you in this place, as imagining then, that matters would haue falne out farre otherwiſe then they did, betweene our Knights and you. Gentlewoman (quoth he) your ſelfe doth ſufficiently know, that the fault proceeded from themſelues, in demaunding ſuch a matter of me, as I could no way yeeld to, but with mine owne deepe diſhonour. But tell mee I pray you, did the Queene (your Miſtreſſe) abide there all this day, in the ſame place where I left her? Behold Sir (quoth the Gentlewoman) a Letter which ſhee hath ſent you: And kiſſing it 
                        〈…〉
                      ſhee humbly preſented it to his hand.
                  Now, becauſe (as I h

                     ſſage. My Lord, quoth ſhee, ſeeing you haue diſabled the Knights, that had the charge of her conduct, and the way (which ſhe muſt paſ

                        ••
                     en to vnderſtand: the Queene my Miſtreſſe doth earneſtly deſire you, that you would be her guide to Mirefleure, where ſhe hopes to finde the Princeſſe Oriana, with whom ſhee hath eſpeciall occaſion of conference.
                  Truely Gentlewoman (anſwered Floreſtan, I ſhould be very ſorry, to deny ſo goodly a Lady as your Queene is, in any thing ſhe pleaſeth to command of me, and moſt humbly I thanke her, for the high honour ſhe doth me, in chuſing me to her conduct: but now the day is ſo farre ſpent, and the Sunne declining to his reſt, that I thinke it neceſſary to tarry till the breake of day, and to morrow morning wee will be ſo earely with her, as if we had reſted there all night. Doe (ſaid the Gentlewoman,) as ſeemes beſt to your ſelfe.
                  Then food was brought them to eate, and they ſupt together, deuiſing on diuers things, vntill it was a fit houre for reſt. Now, becauſe, beſide the place where the old Hermite ſlept himſelfe, there was but another very ſmall Cell. Floreſtan left it to the Gentle-woman, and went to repoſe himſelfe vnder the Trees, vntill the houre of diſlodging thence. Being armed, he called for the Gentle-woman, and ſo they took their way towards the Queen, who continually exſpected when they would come. Being arriued at the Tents, Floreſtan entred that, belonging to Grumedan: who met him, with kind embraces, not a little 
                        〈◊〉
                      of his preſence. And after 
                        •…
                     rs ſpeeches paſſed betweene them, Grumedan ſaide vnto him: My Lord Floreſtan, me thinkes the Queene hath ſuſtayned no loſſe, finding ſo good a change of you for her owne Knights: and thus much let me aſſure you, that ſhee is one of the very wiſeſt Princeſſes I haue euer ſeene, highly deſeruing to bee

honoured and ſerued. Vpon my faith Lord Grumedan, anſwered Floreſtan, I account my ſelfe happy, if I may accompliſh any thing liking to her.
                  So walking vp and downe within the Tent; with a louing embrace, Grumedan ſaid. Tell me Sir, I pray you, what haue you done with the Shields you caried hence yeſterday? Why Sir (quoth hee) I haue ſent them all to your deare friend Galuanes, who now is at the Encloſed Iſle, becauſe he may there rank them according to their merite. And if any other Knights of Rome deſire to re-obtaine them, as in reuenge of their fellowes ſhame, they may there alſo compaſſe the meanes, by triall, how well they deſerue at the Arch of loyall Louers.
                  
                  In the ſpeaking of theſe wordes, the Queene Sardamira entred into Grumedans Tent: which cauſed Floreſtan to be ſilent; and meeting her with humble reuerence, fell on his knee to kiſſe her hand. But the Queene ſtayed him by the arme, and raiſing him vp gently from the ground, ſaid, that he was moſt heartily welcome. Madame (quoth he, I haue all my life time bin a ſeruant to Ladies: by a much ſtronger obligation (then euer) doe I now ſtand engadged, to imploy my very vttermoſt paines for you, whoſe merit reacheth beyond them all. In good faith Sir, replied the Queene, I muſt needes thanke you, for the great paines you haue taken; and ſeeing you are ſo ready to make amends, for the fault wherein my Knights haue offended: reaſon requires that I ſhould likewiſe pardon you, for any error againſt me or my women.
                  Me thinkes Madame (anſwered Floreſtan) that I can feele no paine or trauaile by obeying you: in regard that your admired beautie doth well deſerue the conduct of a farre better Knight then I am. But in affording me this honour, you bind me to ye, in more then I ſhalbe able to ſatisfie.
                  Let vs breake off this talke, ſaid the Queene, and tell me; ſhall wee now ſet forward on our iourney? When you pleaſe Madame, anſwered Floreſtan. Firſt, quoth Grumedan, I hold it meere, to conuey theſe wounded Knights, to a Towne not farre hence, where they may be well attended, vntill they bee able to mount on horſebacke. Let it bee ſo, ſaid ſhe. Then was a goodly white palfray brought her, whereon being ſafely ſeated ſhee ſet onward with her Ladies and Gentlewomen, being guided by Floreſtan and Grumedan, who entertained the time with ſuch good diſcourſe, as the way ſeemed neither long or tedious.
                  Heere I muſt tell yee, that the Princeſſe Oriana had (long before) heard of the Queenes comming to Mirefleure, onely to ſee her, which grieued her very greatly, knowing ſhe would talke with her concerning the Emperour, whoſe very name was hatefull to her. But when ſhe vnderſtood withall, that Grumedan and Floreſtan came in her company, her ſorrow was indifferently aſſwaged, hoping to heare (by them) ſome tidings of Amadis. And as ſhee was buſied in theſe thoughts, newes came, that they were alighted at the gate; wherevpon ſhepreſently went to welcome them.
                  The Queen Sardamira going for-moſt, made a low reuerence to the Princeſſe, with a proffer of kiſſing her hand: but ſhe tooke her by the arme, and ledde her into a goodly Haule, expreſſely prepared for her

entertainment. There they ſate downe each by other, and the two Knights neere vnto them; and as they were in talke together, Oriana (perceiuing the Queene Sardamira lend an attentiue eare, to a priuate diſcourſe betweene her and Grumedan) ſoftly ſpake thus to Floreſtan aſide.
                  In good ſadneſſe Lord Floreſtan, it is a very long time ſince wee ſaw you in this Countrie, to my no litle diſcontentment: as well in regard of the good-will I euer bare you, as for the great loſſe many a poore ſoule hath ſuſtayned, who were wont to finde helpe by you, your brother Amadis, and many other of your followers. But curſed be they that cauſed this ſo long ſeparation, and I beleeue that I ſpeake it not, but vpon vrgent occaſion: for I know a poore Damoſell, in daunger of diſinheriting, becauſe ſhee hath no man to right the wrong offered her.
                  But if Amadis were heere once againe, and ſo many more as are too farre off abſent: ſhee might well aſſure her ſelfe, that that which is hers in iuſtice, ſhould not ſo eaſily be taken from her; whereas by reaſon of their abſence, ſhe hath now no better hope or comfort, then onely in death. Oriana continuing on theſe ſpeeches, teares iſſued abundantly from her faire eyes, as fore-ſeeing her vnfortunate end, if the King ſhould ſo much forget himſelfe, to deliuer her to the Romanes. And ſhe had ſolemnely vowed betweene God and her ſoule, that ſhe ſhould be no ſooner on Ship-bord, but ſhe would throwe her ſelfe into the Sea, and this was her finall concluſion.
                  Very well vnderſtood Floreſtan, that this cloſe-couched Enigma concerned her ſelfe; whereupon he thus replied. Madame, God being all made of mercy, will neuer bee vnmindefull of them that put their truſt in him: for (as yet) hee neuer did, and doubtleſſe, he will not now beginne with ſo deſolate a Damoſell. As for my Lord Amadis, aſſure your ſelfe, that he is in perfect health, continually in queſt of ſtrange aduentures: ſo that his famous deeds in farre diſtant Countries, renownes his name in all parts of the world,
                  All theſe words were ouer-heard by the Queene Sardamira, and perceiuing that they ſpake of Amadis, ſhe ſaid to Oriana. God keepe him from the Emperours fingers: for hee is the onely man in the world that he hateth moſt, next to another Knight, who ſoiourned ſome while in the Court of King Taffinor of Bohemia. This Knight I now ſpeake of, not much aboue a yeare ſince, ouer-came (in open field) the moſt gentle Knight Garadan, the onely man in all the Romaine Armie: except the noble Prince Saluſte Quide, who is now come into this Countrie to the King your Father, to conclude a marriage betweene his Lord and you. And hee beares him this hatred, for cauſing the ouer throw of eleuen other Knights beſide: whoſe hope was to reuenge the iniurie done to their friend on the day following the Combate with the firſt knight, being appointed ſo many to ſo many. This miſaduenture ſo diſmayed the whole Romaine Armie, that the Emperor was compelled (according to a former-made couenant) to raiſe his Campe, and to render back to King Taffinor, whatſoeuer he had conquered from him.
                  Afterward, ſo briefly as ſhe could, the Queene reported, the whole manner of the ſeuerall fights, and to

what iſſue they ſorted, as you haue heard already at large. So helpe me God, Madame, anſwered Floreſtan, although your Emperour ſhould neuer looue him, yet there are many other worthy men, that wiſhe him all true happineſſe and honour: and (in my poore opinion) Lord Amadis needes not care for his malice.
                  Notwithſtanding, make knowen to vs (faire Queene) if you can, the name of the man ſo much commended by your ſelfe. Vnderſtand Sir, (quoth ſhe) one while he cals him-ſelfe, the Knight with the Greene Sword, and another while, the Knight of the Dwarfe: albeit I am verily perſwaded, that neither the one or the other is his true name indeed. But becauſe hee weares a Sword, that hath a ſcabberd of greene colour, and a Dwarfe doth ordinarily attend on him: theſe names haue therefore beene impoſed on him, and vſually he makes anſwere to them.
                  When Floreſtan heard theſe wordes, he was very ioyfull, knowing for a certaintie, that it was Amadis: the like did Oriana, who had noted the ſame reportes before by many. And becauſe ſhee was now ſome hinderance to her, that ſhe could not haue any longer priuate conference; ſhee aroſe, thus ſpeaking to the Queene Sardamira. Madame, in regard of your tedious iourney this day, you cannot chuſe but be weary; wherefore a place of repoſe is more conuenient for you. Then ſhee conducted her into a goodly Chamber, and there leauing her to her owne deſſeignes, went downe into the Garden, accompanied with Mabila and the Damoſell of Denmarke, to whom ſhee declared all her former intelligence, concerning the knight of the Green Sword, whom they knew aſſuredly to be Amadis.
                  
                  On my faith Madame, ſaid Mabila, if it be ſo, let mee tell you the Dreame which I had this laſt night paſt. Me thought that wee were in a Chamber cloſe ſhut vp, and that we heard a great tumultuous noiſe without, which made vs fearefull beyond meaſure: but your Amadis ſuddenly comming thither, brake the doore, calling for you out aloud. Then I ſhewing you to him, me thought hee tooke you by the hand, and ſo brought vs forth, placing vs in a very ſtrong Tower, ſaying to vs: Abide heere, without any dread or terror, and therewithall I happened to wake. This makes mee verily beleeue, that hee will ſet you at libertie, and free you from their power, that hope to haue you hence.
                  Deare Friend and Couſin, anſwered Oriana, you giue mee great hope and comfort; and if I were worthy of ſuch a happineſſe, I could deſire our Lord to heare your good wiſhes: otherwiſe, that wee might both dye in one inſtant. Forbeare ſuch words, replyed Mabila; for he that is aboue all fortunes whatſoeuer, will ſend you (at his good pleaſure) a better iſſue out of all troubles, then you can wiſh or imagine. But conferre with Floreſtan, and earneſtly deſire him and his friends, to doe their beſt endeauour, to breake the Kings intention, that no ſuch concluſion may paſſe for currant.
                  Now, let me tell you, that Galaor had already done ſo much as was poſſible for him, not by any aduertiſement or entreaty vrged to him on the Princeſſes behalfe: but becauſe he plainely perceiued, what ſhame would enſue by diſinheriting Oriana, for the aduancement of her

Siſter Leonora. For, ſome day or two before Floreſtans arriuall at Mirefleure, King Liſuart being returned from hunting, tooke Galaor aſide, as they rode on the way, thus ſpeaking to him. My louing friend, I haue euermore found ſuch fidelitie in you, and repoſed ſuch truſt in your counſell, as I neuer intend to conclude any mater of importance, without imparting it firſt to you. You vnderſtand what honour the Emperour hath done me, and his embaſſage ſo lately ſent me, requeſting to haue my daughter Oriana as his wife: wherein (as I conceiue) our Lord hath wrought moſt graciouſly both for her and me, becauſe he is the onely potent and redoubted Prince, at this day liuing in all Chriſtendome.
                  In which reſpect, hee being thus allied with me, I ſhall neuer haue any neighbour or enemy, that dare preſume any way to offend me, and I ſhalbe more reſpected and dreaded, then euer any King of Great Brittaine heeretofore hath beene. Moreouer, it is a matter almoſt impoſſible, to ſeeke any better prouiſion for her; for ſhee being wife to ſo mightie an Emperour, Leonora ſhall afterward remaine ſole Lady of my Dominions, which otherwiſe may happen to be diuided, to our no little detriment and danger. And yet let me tell you, I purpoſe not to doe any thing in this caſe, without the aduice of the Lords and Knights of my Court: but more eſpecially of you, whom I coniure (by the loue and affection you haue alwayes borne me) to tell me freely your opinion, and without any diſſimulation.
                  Much amazed was Galaor, to heare the King vſe ſuch language, perceiuing apparantly heereby, that he meant wholly to diſinherite his eldeſt Daughter and right heire, to aduantage the ſecond. For this cauſe, he ſtood a long while very penſiue, without anſwering ſo much as a word, till the King began again thus to rouſe him. Come Sir, awake your ſilent cogitation, and tell me truely what you think. Sir (quoth he) I beſeech you to hold me excuſed, for I finde my capacitie ouer feeble, to yeeld you any faithfull counſell in a caſe ſo important. Moreouer, you are minded to congregate the chiefeſt Lords of your Land, to commune with them in ſo ſerious a buſineſſe: and they (no doubt) like loyall ſubjects, will direct you as becomes a King. But yet (quoth the King) I would gladly firſt haue your aduice, elſe you will giue mee cauſe to miſconceite you. God ſhield me Sir, ſaid Galaor, from ſo doing: rather I will liberally lay my heart open to you, according to mine owne poore iudgment, and the true integrity of my minde.
                  Sir, ſaid he, whereas you ſay, that in marrying your Daughter Oriana with the Emperour, there remaines no poſſibility of a fairer fortune: ſurely, I am of a quite contrary opinion; for, ſhe being your principall Heire, and ſent into ſo remote a Country, to loſe a kingdome already prouided for her, you ſhall leaue her poore without meanes, and ſubiect to a people, but ſlenderly agreeing with the manners and conditions of this Nation. And whereas you conceite, that in being wife to an Emperour, and dignified with the name of an Empreſſe, her authoritie and renowne is the ſurer afterward: before God Sir, let mee plainely tell you, that you wrong both your iudgement and reaſon therein. Fore-thinke what may enſue, and ſay ſhee haue heires male

by her husband, which is the ſole comfort of any kingdome: ſhe becomming a widdow, the firſt fauour her owne childe ſhall doe for her, is, to vrge her retreate, to hold poſſeſſion of the Empire by himſelfe. If he take a wife, then it falles out far worſe for her, becauſe the new Empreſſe will be ſecond to none, and then it is moſt certaine, that your Princely Daughter lyes open to a thouſand inconueniences, and vnauoydable grieuous extreamities. For firſt, ſhee hath loſt this Country, which was certaine to her, as being her naturall place of birth and breeding, to liue in a ſtrange land, farre from parents, ſubiects and ſeruants, which is no common kind of affliction.
                  And whereas you alleage, that by his alliance and fauour, you are ſure to be ſuccoured, and much feared. Surely Sir, I muſt tell you, that (thankes be giuen to our Lord for it) you haue ſo many true friends, and truſty Knights at your command, as (without any helpe of the Romaines) you may eaſily extend your limites when you pleaſe.
                  And I am perſwaded, that in exſpectation of ſupport from them, they will rather ſeeke to ruinate and deſtroy you, then furniſh you with any ſuch aſſiſtance as you may imagine, ſcorning all equality, or any to bee greater then themſelues. Moreouer, it is moſt certaine, that they can couet no better meanes, then by compaſſing ſome apt occaſion, to regiſter you downe in their Chronicles, to your ſhame and their glory, vnder the ſhadow of ſome ſleight fauour, irregularly affoorded; then which, no greater miſchiefe can happen to you and yours.
                  And alas Sir, what reaſon haue you to ſend the Princeſſe Oriana ſo farre from you, being your Daughter and chiefeſt Heire, onely to aduance the Princeſſe Leonora, who is her yonger Siſter? By my ſoule, of a moſt vpright and vnpartiall King, renowned through the wide world for the Authour of Iuſtice: you will procure the greateſt ſcandall to your reputation, and wound your vntainted honour ſo deepely, as neuer powerfull Prince or King did the like.
                  But I hope that Heauen will better direct your iudgement, and ſettle more ſurer cogitations in your ſoule, which I (as the very meaneſt Knight in your Court) doe hartily deſire. And beleeue it Sir, that I durſt neuer haue beene ſo bold, to tell you the free cenſure of my ſoul, but that you pleaſed ſo expreſſely to command me, and I (as a loyall ſeruant) could doe no leſſe. And let this be your perſwaſion of me, that during my life time, I will keepe my promiſe, faith and fidelity to you, as one that ſtands much obliged to you, for infinite good turnes and fauors done me.
                  Well declared King Liſuart by his countenance, that he was ſcarſely pleaſed with Galaors remonſtrance: and he likewiſe as quickely apprehended it: wherefore, continuing on his ſpeech, he ſaid. Sir, King Perion my Father, hath commaunded mine attendance on him in Gaule, ſo ſoone as poſſibly I can: and becauſe I meane to ſet hence to morow morning, to the end you may not conceiue, but that I haue counſelled you faithfully; if you bee ſo pleaſed, whatſoeuer I haue ſpoken, I will ſet downe in writing, that you may acquaint them with it, whom you intend to aſſemble together. I pray you doe ſo, anſwered the King. And at theſe wordes, they were

come neere vnto the City, which made them alter their diſcourſe.
                  Being alighted, the King betook himſelfe to his Chamber, where he ſate downe very ſad and penſiue, and would not all that day be ſeene in any company. The next morning, Galaor tooke ſhipping, according to his former determination: for h
                        •…
                     ould not bee preſent at the reſolution of this mariage, as knowing certainly, that the King would not bee altered from his purpoſe, notwithſtanding all aduice and councell to the contrary. More-ouer, he knew ſome part of the priuacies betweene Amadis and Oriana, who all this while remooued not from Mirefleure, whither the Queen Sardamira came to ſee her, as you haue heard already, finding her to be the onely faireſt Princeſſe in the world. What would ſhee then haue thought, if ſhe had ſeene her in her former condition, before this continuall melancholy ſeized her, for the abſence of her Amadis, and this new purpoſe for marriage, which grieuouſly oppreſſed her? Being now ſomewhat meagre, pale and penſiue: yet ſhe appeared, as if Nature had ſtudied all her life-time, to make her the mirrour of choiceſt perfection.
                  The Queene finding the day no way fauourable, to acquaint Oriana with the cauſe of her comming, deferred it till the next morning; when reſorting againe to ſee her; and hauing firſt heard Maſſe together, they walked along the allies of the Garden, and proceeded ſo farre into the buſineſſe, that ſhe told her, how dearely the Emperour affected her, what purſuite he made to enioy her as his wife, and what ſupreme felicity attended her, onely by this mariage.
                  But the anſwere of Oriana was ſo vntuneable, as the Queene durſt proceede no further with her: but in the interim, Floreſtan came to them, who purpoſing to take his leaue, that he might returne to the Encloſed Iſle, ſhe tooke him aſide, declaring, what infinite afflictions hourely encompaſſed her, & how ſhamefully the King her father dealt with her, by compelling her to marry into a ſtraunge Country, and to the onely man of the world, whom ſhe leaſt reſpected.
                  But beleeue it Sir, (quoth ſhe) if he continue in this humour, the firſt newes he ſhall heare of me, after my departure hence, will be my death. For come what may, if he ſunder me from this Country, Death, and the Sea ſhall diuide me alſo.
                  For it is my full intent, to drowne all my diſaſters in the waues: who (for euer) ſhall remaine witneſſes of my ſorrowes, and in them I exſpect to find more compaſſion, then in mine owne kinred, countrie, friendes and ſeruants. And therefore, honourable Lord Floreſtan, I humbly beſeech you, (for Gods ſake) to imploy ſome paines for diſſwading him from his intention: otherwiſe (vpon my faith) it will be a great clogge of conſcience to him, and the very ſtraungeſt miſ-fortune, wherein a poore diſinherited Lady can fall, being forſaken of God and men.
                  Thus ſpeaking, ſhe wept ſo extremely, that Floreſtan (although he was one of the greateſt ſpirited men in the world) could not refraine from teares, hauing his heart ſo confounded with compaſſion towards her, as hee was not able to vtter a word. Notwithſtanding, at laſt he got the maiſtrie of this oppreſſing paſſion, and ſaid. Madame,

you ſhall doe me great wrong, if you hold not this conceit of me, that I am wholly yours, ready to obey you in any ſeruice till death. But to ſpeake to the King your father, as you would haue me, it is a matter beyond all poſſibility: for you your ſelfe do know, what hatred he beares to me, onely in the deſpight of my Lord Amadis, forgetfull of ſo many high and worthy ſeruices, as both he and all his linage haue euermore done to him. And if he haue receiued any from me, hee neuer needs to thank me for it conſidering, I neuer did any for his ſake, but onely by the commaund of him, who hath ſoueraigne power ouer me, and whom I will not contradict at any time. And that was the reaſon, for my being in the laſt warre of the ſeuen Kings, not as any helpe to them of Great Brittaine: but onely for preſeruation of your iuſt title and right thereto, as ſhee that ſhall one day, (by Gods leaue) bee Lady and Queene thereof.
                  Preſume alſo Madame, that you haue this intereſt in me, that this which you haue told to mee, I will thinke on and make knowen to King Perion, and other good friends, to procure ſome remedy for you in this diſtreſſe. And I make no doubt, but he will prouide for you in ſuch ſort, as you ſhall haue occaſion to reſt contented. Nor purpoſe I to ſoiourne in any place, vntill I come to the Encloſed Iſle, where I ſhall finde the Prince Agraies, who is very deſirous to doe you any ſeruice, as your ſelfe doth well know, eſpecially for the loue of his Siſter Mabila. There ſhall wee conſult together, what courſe is beſt to be taken in this caſe, without ſpare of any thing remaining in our power. But know you certainely, (quoth Oriana) that Agraies is, or will be there? Yes Madame, ſaid he, as Lord Grumedan hath aſſured me, as hee receiued inſtruction by one of his Squires, that came thence within theſe few dayes. I beſeech you then, replied Oriana, to relate vnto him amply, what confidence I do repoſe in him: And if you heare any newes of your Brother Amadis, faile not to acquaint me therewith ſo ſoon as poſſibly you may. There-of aſſure your ſelfe Madame, anſwered Floreſtan.
                  
                  With theſe wordes, he tooke his leaue of her, kiſſing her lillie-white hand, and returning to the Queene Sardamira, ſpake thus. Madame, I am conſtrained by force to leaue you, and elſe where to ſeeke after my further fortunes: but whereſoeuer I ſhall beſtow my ſelfe, be bold, that I am alwayes your knight and ſeruant, and ſo I pray you to account of me. In good faith Sir, ſaid ſhe, they that refuſe ſo faire an offer, may wel be reputed but poore in iudgment: becauſe I am perſwaded, that you are held to be one of the beſt and moſt courteous knights this day liuing. And God ſhield me from ſuch monſtrous ingratitude, to deny a ſeruant of ſuch honor and worth: rather moſt louingly I accept your kindnes, and returne you thankes with all my heart.
                  
                     Floreſtan, looking on her with an affectionate eye, and beholding her to be ſo amiably faire, ſaid: Madame, I beſeech our Lord, (who hath enriched you with ſuch rare beautie) to grant your own hearts beſt deſires: and thankefully I take your moſt gracious anſwere, becauſe now I can doe nothing elſe for you, but remaine in ready willingneſſe of ſeruice, whereſoeuer you ſhall pleaſe to commaund me. So taking leaue of her, Mabila,
                     
and the other Ladies, he mounted on horſebacke: deſiring Lord Grumedan, that if he receiued any tydings of Amadis, he would let him vnderſtand thereof ſo ſoone as he could, at the Encloſed Iſle, whether he now went, to ſee Agraies and his other aſſociates.
               
               
                  CHAP. XV.
                  
                     How the Knight of the greene Sword, (who afterward ſtiled himſelfe the Greeke Knight) Bruneo de bonne Mer, and Angriote d'Eſtrauaux, embarked themſelues in the company of the faire Graſinda, and of that which happened to them afterward:
                  
                  
                     MAſter Eliſabet hauing taken good order for Shipping, with all ſuch neceſſaries, anſwerable to the enterpriſe of Graſinda, the windes alſo ſitting faire and auſpicious: ſhe went aboord, attended by the Knight of the Greene Sword, Bruneo, Angriote, and many other Knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen, as partly hath beene reported already. Hauing weighed their Ankers, and put forth into the large and ſpacious Seas, ſometimes be calmed, and otherwhiles tempeſtuouſly afflicted: at length, by fauour of Heauen, and the great diligence of Maſter Eliſabet (an extraordinary skilfull Pilot) they paſſed by ſo many ſtraites and Iſlandes, that they diſcouered the coaſte of Great Brittaine.
                  
                  Then the Knight with the Greene Sword, beholding the Country, where he hoped to finde his beſt happineſſe and comfort, became exceeding ioyfull. And becauſe he would by no meanes be diſcouered, he deſired Graſinda, and all the reſt in his company, to entitle him no other thence-forward, but the Greeke Knight. Then hee commanded Gandalin, to bring the ſixe Swords, which the Queene Menoreſſa had giuen him, at his departure from Couſtantinople two of them he gaue to Bruneo and Angriote, and himſelf guirded on one, becauſe he intended not to be knowen by that which hee vſually woare, hauing a greene ſcabbard, as oftentimes hath beene before remembred.
                  Comming neere to the place, where King Liſuart then made his aboade, Graſinda and hee being with-drawen aſide, he began to her in this manner. Madame, by gracious fauour of the Heauens, wee are now very neere the Countrie, whereto your heart hath alwayes pretended a moſt earneſt deſire: and I dare aſſure ye, that without ſpare of life or any trauaile, I will endeauour to make knowen, what bountifull graces you haue from time to time affoorded me. Worthy Greeke knight (quoth ſhe) ſuch is my truſt in God, that he will not take his mercies from me, and as he hath prouided mee of ſo good a knight to be my guide, ſo hee will bleſſe me with the hope I aime at. But I pray you Sir, ſeeing wee are ſo neere to land, let vs goe on ſhoare, you, Angriote, Bruneo, and my ſelfe, without any more; and there wee may priuately conferre together, what is firſt to bee done, before I preſent my ſelfe to the Ladies of this Country.
                  
                     
Then Maſter Eliſabet called for a Skiffe, which inſtantly was broght, whereinto they entred: and as they made towards the Shoare, they eſſpied a Ship lying at Anker. Herevpon our Greeke Knight, being deſirous to know who was in it, commaunded the Mariners to get neere it, which being done, Angriote called to them in the Shippe, demaunding whence they were, whether they were bound, and who was aboord. Surely Sir, replyed our Patrone, our Shippe is come from the Encloſed Iſle, and heere are two Knights aboord, who will gladly tell ye, what you deſire to know. When our Greeke Knight heard ſpeech of the place, whereto he was ſo much affected, and that two of his companions were there, his heart leapt with ioy; and Angriote continuing his queſtions, deſired the Patrone, to cauſe the two Knights to come vp on the Deck, and (in the meane while) to tell him, how they were named. That may not I doe, anſwered the Patrone, leſt they ſhould grow diſcontented with me; but I will call them vp to you; and performed his word accordingly.
                  Then they came vp on the Orelop; and Angriote ſaluting them, demanded, if they knew where King Liſuart lay? Truſt me Sir, anſwered one of them, wee will gladly inſtruct you in any thing we can; but firſt we would entreate you, to reſolue vs in one matter (if it conſiſt in your power) for which wee haue vndertaken this voyage, and purpoſe not to ſoiourne in any place, vntill wee can be therein ſatisfied. If wee know it, ſaid Angriote, you may be well aſſured, that we will not conceale it from you.
                  Sir Knights, (quoth the other) haue you heard any newes of a Knight, named Amadis de Gaule, in ſearch of whom, many of his friends haue endured much paines and trauaile, and haue left few places without enquirie?
                  Theſe wordes did ſo touch our Greeke Knight with ioy and compaſſion, that hee could not refraine from teares: conſidering, what affection ſo many worthy men did beare him, and what ſorrowes they ſuffered for his ſake. Firſt tell me, ſaid Angriote, what, and who you are, and afterward, you ſhall vnderſtand ſo much as I know. Then the other, who (all this while) had bin ſilent, ſtepping forward, ſaid: Such as know me, call me Dragonis, and this my companion is named Enill, both reſolued to ore-run the whole Ocean, and queſtion Port by Port, vntill we finde the men wee ſpeake of. Gentlemen (quoth Angriote,) God be your ſpeed, and for your ſakes, I will gladly enquire of our Shippes, wherein are ſtraungers of many Nations, what they can ſay to this demand of yours. Our Greeke knight vrged him to this anſwer, becauſe hee would not be knowen ſo ſoone, Angriote then began again, ſaying: I pray you Sir, where may we finde King Liſuart, and what newes is in his Court? Sir, anſwered Dragonis, he is now in a certain City of his, called Tagades, an excellent Port of the Sea, confronting Normandie. And there is a great aſſembly of his knights, ſitting in coū
                     ſell, about a motion made by the Emperour of Rome, to enioy his Daughter Oriana in mariage, wherto no one will giue conſent. Already there are arriued many Romanes to conuey her thence with them, among whom is the Prince Saluſta Quide, Duke of Calabria, & other the greateſt Lords of the Empire, beſide a worthy traine of Ladies and Gentlewomen; and ſhee is (already)

called Empreſſe of Rome. But ſhe mournes inceſſantly; for it is much againſt her mind, that this marriage ſhould be ſo much as talked of.
                  We may well imagine, that this was more then Greek to our Greek Knight: for neuer was man ſtrooken into ſuch an aſtoniſhment; eſpecially, vnderſtanding the great regrates and grieuances of the Princeſſe. Notwithſtanding, his ſpirits recouering chearefull vigour, and being reſolued withall, that it was quite againſt her conſent, and contrary to the liking of the Lords of Great Brittaine: hee might the more eaſily helpe her by Sea or Land, wherein hee would not faile the very meaneſt Gentle-woman in the world. Much greater duty then he owed to her, without whoſe grace and fauour hee could not liue one houre, as he was verily perſwaded in his ſoule. And highly thanked God, for vouchſafing his arriuall in a time ſo opportune, that hee might doe her any ſeruice. As not doubting but to compaſſe the height of his attempt, (getting her into his power, and without any blame by her) and to ouercome all his misfortunes together. And here (in his ſoule) he read a lecture to his Ladie, diſcourſing his bitter ſufferings and languiſhments, the paines and perils by him endured, ſince the time he ſaw her laſt, and now, the cataſtrophe of all contentment, after a more then Herculean labour.
                  Now, ſaid Angriote to Dragonts, you are ſure that the Romaines are already come about this buſineſſe? On my faith (quoth he) it is yet but foure dayes, ſince wee parted from the Encloſed Iſle, & on the very ſame day, there arriued Quedragant, Landin his Nephew, Garnate of the Dreadfull Dale, Mandacian of the Siluer Bridge, and Helye the Deliberate, who came to know of Floreſtan & Agraies, when they ſhould begin the queſt of Amadis de Gaule. And becauſe Quedragant purpoſed to ſend to the Court of King Liſuart, to vnderſtand there ſome tidings by ſtrangers: Floreſtan made him anſwere, that it wold be but loſt labor, in regard, that himſelfe had made the like queſtion, & could know nothing. But wee heard by one of his Squires, that there happened ſome difference between them, which he corrected in ſuch ſort, as he is much commended in all places for it. I pray you Sir (quoth Angriote) tel vs, what is that Floreſtan? He is (anſwered Dragonis) one of the ſons of king Perion of Gaule, who ſufficiently reſembleth the goodnes and worth of his two other brethren.
                  Hereupon, at large he recited the contention between him & the Romanes, in preſence of the Queene Sardamira, & how his Squire (after-ward) came to the Encloſed Iſle with their Shields, wheron (in bloody caracters) was written each mans name. And becauſe they were ſo ſhreudly handled by Floreſtan, the Queene ſent after to entreate him to be her conduct to Mirefleure, whether ſhee went to ſee the Princeſſe Oriana. Theſe newes were highly pleaſing to the Greeke Knight & his aſſociates, neuertheleſſe, when he heard him name Mirefleure: his hart began to tremble, remēbring what delight and pleaſure hee had there ſomtime receiued. Wherfore, with-drawing himſelf aſide, he called Gandalin to him, ſaying. My friend Gandalin, thou heareſt (as wel as I) theſe tidings concerning Oriana, & doeſt know withal, that if they ſhould take effect I could not liue one houre after: therefore let me preuaile with thee, to doe one thing which I will aduiſe thee, and this it is.
                  
                     
Goe thou with Ardan, to Graſinda, and tell her, that you two, (with theſe other Knights heere preſent) will trauaile to finde out Amadis de Gaule. Being come to the Knights, ſecretly tell them, that I am heere, and deſire them (with thee) to returne to the Encloſed Iſle. Finding there Quadragant, and Agrayes, entreate them from me, to keep them-ſelues there together, vntil the time of my arriuall, which ſhall be (by Gods helpe) within eight dayes, little more or leſſe. Say alſo to my Brother Floreſtan, and to thy father Gandales, that I would haue them to take order, for prouiding ſo many Shippes, and other Veſſels in a readineſſe, as they can procure. For I purpoſe to be ſeene (ſhortly) in a place, where (if they be ſo pleaſed) I would gladly requeſt their company: and thou knoweſt ſufficiently Gandalin: what diligence is required in a caſe ſo important as this is; wherefore, once more I deſire thee, not to bee ſlow or tardie heerein. Then he called the Dwarfe to him, and ſaid: Ardan, goe with Gandalin, and follow thoſe inſtructions, which he ſhall giue thee from mee.
                  So Gandalin, according to his Maſters commaund, went to Graſinda, in this maner. Madame, quoth he, we two are determined to leaue the Greeke Knight, and goe abord this Shippe, becauſe wee would trauaile along with theſe two Knights, in the ſearche for Amadis de Gaule. Therefore, good Madame, conſider with your ſelfe, if you haue any ſeruice to comand vs: returning you moſt humble thankes, for your manifold fauours done vs, without any merite at all on our behalfe. The like they ſaid to the Greeke Knight, Angriote and Brunco; and ſo went aboorde the Shippe to Dragonis.
                  
                  Heere I muſt tell ye, that Angriote was made acquainted with this intention: wherefore, to palliate and conceale it the more cleanely, he called to Dragonis, ſaying: Sir Knight, this Squire and Dwarfe are deſirous to keepe you company, in your queſt of Amadis de Gaule: becauſe (as themſelues ſay) they ſomtime ſerued him. Dragonis and Enili knew them immediatly, which made them the more willing to accept their company, entertaining them with very kinde and louing reſpect: but much more welcome were they, when they vnderſtood what Gandalin tolde them, which made them weigh Anker preſently, and ſet on towards the Encloſed Iſle. The like did our Greeke Knight and his company, hoping that day to take harbour, in the neereſt Hauen to Tagades, where (as then) King Liſuart kept his Court.
                  Heere were aſſembled with him, moſt of the worthieſt Lords in his kingdome, whom purpoſely he had called together, to conclude the marriage of his Daughter Oriana with the Emperour. But they, reſpecting the good and welfare of the Realme, as it became loyall and true Counſellers to doe, were all of a quite contrary opinion, ſhewing him by many ſound and probable reaſons, that hee went againſt all right and equitie, committing his chiefe Heire, into the ſubiection of a preſumptuous and giddie-headed ſtranger, who (as they approued by precedent examples) might as quickly grow in hatred to her, as he was haire-brained in his ouer-ſudden affection. All which notwithwanding, the King would not liſten to, but alleage ſtill ſuch peremptorie reaſons, meete and conuenient for ſuch a Prince, as will allow nor like any aduice but his owne.
                  
                     
In which regard, Count Argamont abſented himſelfe from this meeting, to a Caſtell of his owne, which was ſome two dayes iourney from the Court: notwithſtanding, he was ſent for againe and againe, and ſo much importuned, as he was brought thither in a Litter, hee being ſo weake and impotent by age, as hee was not able to ſit on horſe-backe.
                  The King being aduertiſed of his comming neere the Court, mounted on horſebacke to meet him, and the next day hee ſate in councell among his Lords, deliuering diuers conſiderations, for maintenance of his former opinion, till at length (ſpeaking to Argamont) thus hee ſaid. Honorable Vncle, you are ſufficiently acquainted with the occaſion, why I haue called together this great aſſembly, which plainly is, for mariage of my daughter with the Emperour of Rome, a matter by him moſt earneſtly labored and deſired. Wherefore, let mee entreate you firſt, to tell mee what you conceite thereof: to the end, that theſe Lords may the more freely afterward, acquaint mee with their ſeuerall opinions. A long while the old Earle excuſed him-ſelfe, till being vrged thereto by the Kings expreſſe commaund, after ſome alligations for his owne defence, he ſpake as followeth.
                  My Lord, ſeeing it is your pleaſure, that I ſhould ſpeak my minde in this noble aſſembly, concerning the Emperours marriage with the Princeſſe Oriana: I moſt humbly beſeech you, to receiue in good part what I ſhall ſay. I know it to be treaſon in as high a degree, to diſſemble with a Prince in matter of good counſell, as otherwiſe to offend againſt his royall perſon: and therefore, without any clouding or diſſembling, credit what I ſpeake in my poore aduice, albeit I haue often enough told it you before. Sir, you know, that Madame Oriana (your eldeſt Daughter) ought to ſucceede you, and by iuſt reaſon, is heire to the Countries, which God and Fortune hath giuen to your charge; whereto, by the right of Nature, ſhe hath more true title, then euer you had, or could pretend. For it fell to you, onely by the death of King Falaugris, who was but your Brother, and ſhee is your owne Daughter, and the eldeſt. Therefore, conſider with your ſelfe, that if the like had beene done to you, which now you purpoſe to the Princeſſe Oriana, you could not haue bin (at this day) ſo great a Lord as you are.
                  Why ſhould you exile her (as it were) hence, to plant my Niece Leonora in her place, conſidering, ſhee neuer offended you, to our knowledge? And if you thinke, that by marrying her to the Emperour Patin, you ſhall thereby make her a greater Princeſſe, and moſt happily prouided for in your imagination: Beleeue me my Lord, you come very farre ſhort of your account. For you are not ignorant, that if they haue children together, ſhe ſuruiuing the Emperour, ſhall but ſimply remaine Dowager of Rome, in ſteed of being (after you) Lady and Queene of this kingdome.
                  Nay, which is much more, doe you thinke that your Subiects will euer agree thereto? I am perſwaded in my ſoule, if they ſhould ſay, yea, it were againſt the Religion of their ſoules. And therefore, Heauen fore-fend, that I ſhould tell you otherwiſe, then my conſcience aſſures me to be true: albeit I know (to my no litle griefe) that, let vs alleage

whatſoeuer we can, you will be gouernde by your own fancie. Wherfore, moſt humbly I deſire you, to pardon what I haue ſaid, being compeld thereto by your ſeuere iniunction, againſt which may bee no gain-ſaying.
                  Then he ſate ſilent, and the King gaue order, that euery man ſhould deliuer his minde: but they all agreed with the opinion of Count Argamont, which the King perceiuing, he thus replyed: My Lords, I haue fully vnderſtood your ſeueral iudgements: all which notwithſtanding, how can I (with mine honour) reuocate what I haue already promiſed to the Emperours Ambaſſadours? Therein (quoth the Count and the reſt) you may doe as you pleaſe, for wee haue diſcharged our dutie.
                  By this time, the day being faire, and the Sea calme, our Greeke Knight and his company coaſting along: the Mariners had deſcryed the mountaine, whereof the Towne Tagades tooke his name; and where King Liſuart as then reſided, as formerly hath bin related. Some of them alſo went to Graſinda, and aſſured her, that if the winde chaunged not, they would land her in the Hauen within an houre, or leſſe: and our Knights walking aloft on the Deck of the Shippe, declared them-ſelues thankfull to our Lord, for eſcaping ſuch infinite perils and ſhip-wrackes, as euery minute was incident to them.
                  But whoſoeuer had the greateſt cauſe of contentment, was farre inferiour in ioy to our Greek Knight, who ſince hee ſet eye on the Country, wherein liued all his hope, happineſſe, and ſupport of life, was ſo delighted in his ſoule, as no mans felicity could be anſwerable to his: neither had he power to looke off that long-wiſhed land. Notwithſtāding, fearing left his folly ſhould be too plainly perceiued, he went downe into the Ship, and going to Graſinda, ſaid.
                  Madame, wee are now (as your ſelfe may ſee) at the place which you ſo much deſired, and where I hope (by the perfection of beautie abyding in you) to attaine the full iſſue of mine enterpriſe: ſo that you ſhall ſafely returne home into your Country, with ſuch honour as is iuſtly due to you. For right and reaſon being both on my ſide. God (who is a moſt vpright Iudge) will wholly maintaine the cauſe for you and me.
                  Now, albeit Graſinda ſtood in ſome doubt of her ſucceſſe; yet perceiuing ſhee was come ſo neere to the point, where ſhee muſt either winne or loſe what ſhe much coueted, ſhee made a manifeſt ſhew of a reſolued aſſurance, anſwering the Knight in this manner. Beleeue me Sir, my hope and perſwaſion is greater in your manhood and good fortune, then all the beautie remayning in me.
                  But one thing let mee moſt humbly entreate you, that when you are in the chiefeſt heate of your buſines, you would fixe before your eyes, that you neuer attempted any conqueſt, but you brought it to a full and finall effect. In ſo doing, your renowne will highly enlarge it ſelfe, and my ioy likewiſe, whereby I may the more iuſtly ſtile my ſelfe, the only happy Lady now liuing.
                  It is very expedient (replied our Greeke Knight) that we now conſider what is to be done. You haue a Gentle-woman attending on you, who hath a quicke and apprehenſiue ſpirit, being named Goniſeſa, and ſhe ſpeakes French very perfectly: we will deliuer her a Letter, which

ſhee ſhall preſent to King Liſuart, and his Queene Briſena, who doe (both of them) well vnderſtand, and ſpeake that language. Expreſſe charge muſt bee giuen to the Gentlewoman, that ſhe make no anſwer to any queſtion demaunded of her, but in French onely. After ſhe hath concluded with them, hee ſhall returne hither againe to vs, becauſe we purpoſe to ſtay in this place for her comming backe.
                  
                     Graſinda liked this motion exceeding well; wherefore, without any longer delay, the Gentlewoman was called, and the Letter giuen her: then ſhee entred into a ſmall Barke, with her father, and two other Knights, that were her brethren. Not much differing from the ſame inſtant, the Greeke knight gaue order to Laſinde, Bruneoes Squire, to follow after her, (without her knowledge thereof) for a more certaine obſeruation of her entertainment in the Court, and what ſpeeches ſhould bee vſed to her, after her leaue taken of the King.
                  And the better to colour his preſence there, hee had expreſſe command, to pretend a diligent inquiſition for his Maſter, ſaying to ſuch as demaunded any newes concerning him, that he ſaw him not, ſince hee left him ſicke in Gaule, when he vnder-tooke the queſt of Amadis, meaning to returne to him againe, ſo ſoone as he could.
                  So departed Laſinde, hoping right well to accompliſh his enterpriſe. Soone after, the Gentle-woman arriued at the Town, where ſhe was heedfully obſerued by euery one, as well in regard of her beautie, as for her commendable manner of attendance. Paſſing from ſtreete to ſtreete, enquiring where ſhee might finde the King: ſhee chanced to meete Eſplandian, with two Merlinson his fiſt, which he was going to flye in the field. He perceiuing the Gentle-woman making towards him, went and met her, demaunding if ſhee would command him any ſeruice. Faire youth (quoth ſhe) I ſeeke for the Kings lodging, whither I pray you to be my guide. That will I Lady (quoth he) and gladly ſhall I ſhew it you, if you do not know it. A thouſand thankes ſweete youth, anſwered the Gentle-woman.
                  Then Eſplandian tooke hold on the reines of her Palfray, and ſerued her as a Squire, leading her Palfray to the Palace, where after ſhe was diſmounted, hee conducted her to the King, whom they found walking in a Gallerie, with the chiefeſt Ambaſſadours of Rome, according for the marriage of his Daughter to the Emperour.
                  The Gentle-woman falling on her knees before him, humbly ſaluted him with theſe words. Sir, if it might ſo pleaſe you, that the Queen and all her Ladies were here in preſence, I ſhould then deliuer a meſſage to you, from her that hath ſent me hither to you. And if it ſo fall out, that any of them doe finde her ſelfe intereſſed, by ſuch matter as I am to let them all vnderſtand: ſhe muſt eſſay (if ſhe thinke good) to finde out one to defend her, againſt a good knight, who purpoſeth to be heere very ſpeedily: prouided, that your Maieſty do graunt him ſafe conduct.
                  Truely Damoſell, anſwered the King, wee will not hinder you in your charge. Whereupon, immediatly he ſent Count Argamont, his Vnkle, and Arban, king of North-wales, for the Queene, who ſtayed not long but came thither with her Ladies. Then the ſtrange Gentle-woman,

kiſſing her hand, and making a low obeyſance; ſpake thus. Madame, if that which I haue in charge to deliuer, from her who hath ſent me hither, ſhall ſeeme any way ſtraunge to you, you haue the leſſe reaſon for it, conſidering, that this Court is renowned all the world ouer, for the very greateſt m
                        •…
                     a is, and rarietie of aduentures heere happening, which my ſelfe alſo haue knowen for truth, and that neuer any knight, Lady or Damoſel, returned hence diſcontented. And thereby I am reſolutely perſwaded, that I ſhall finde no leſſe fauour heere, then others formerly haue done: wherefore, receiue this Letter, and if you pleaſe to allow of the contents therein ſet downe, you ſhall ſoone ſee the moſt gentle Greeke knight, and the faireſt Princeſſe in the world, of whom hee hath charge. Then the King commanded the Letter to be publikely read, that euery one might heare what it contained.
                  
                     
                        The Letter ſent from Graſinda, to the Potent King Liſuart.
                        
                        
                           MOST high and magnanimous Prince, I Graſinda, faireſt of all the choyceſt beauties in Romania, doe giue you to vnderſtand, that I am newly arriued in your land, vnder the guard and conduct of a Greek Knight, onely vpon this occaſion: that as I haue already bin preciſely iudged, and confeſſed, for the faireſt woman of al them in Romania: ſo, for the maintenance of this glory, which hath affoorded my ſoule no meane contentment, I would be heere in like caſe reputed, aboue all the Maides in your Court; for otherwiſe my minde can neuer be ſatisfied, becauſe it is the thing, that (beyond all other) I moſt deſire. And if there be any Knight, that in his loue to any particular beautie, or in the behalfe of all together, will contradict mee, hee muſt reſolue himſelfe on two things. Firſt, for Combate againſt the Greeke Knight: And next, that hee bring a Crowne with him from his Lady, according as I my ſelfe will weare another, to the end, that the Conquerour (in ſigne of triumph and victory) may make a preſent thereof to his Miſtreſſe, for whom hee vndertooke this triall. And if you bee pleaſed Sir, to graunt this my humble requeſt, then I likewiſe deſire you to ſend a ſafe conduct by my Gentlewoman, for me, and all my company; but eſpecially for the Greeke Knight, that hee may receiue no other diſcourteſie or out-rage, except ſuch as may happen to him from them with whom he ſhall combate. And if hee chance to vanquiſh the firſt, then let a ſecond, yea, third, ſourth, and fift, or ſo many (one after another) as ſhall haue the courage to contend againſt me and my Knight.
                        
                        
                           Your Maieſties in all ſeruices elſe to bee commanded. GRASINDA.
                        
                     
                  
                  Before God (quoth the King) the Lady muſt needes be extraordinary faire, and the knight bold and valiant, that vndertakes ſo great an enterpriſe: the end whereof will not be eaſie in the attayning, becauſe ſuch fortunes are full of danger, and opinions (in this caſe) as diuers. Notwithſtanding, Damoſell and faire friend, you may returne when you pleaſe; and while we attend for your Ladies arriuall heere: ſafe conduct ſhall bee publiſhed according to her owne deſire; and if ſhee finde none to gain-ſay her challenge for beauty, ſheeſhall (in my minde) haue the accompliſhment of her

owne deſires. Sir, replyed the Gentlewoman, you ſpeake like a good and gracious King, as euer-more you haue bin eſteemed. The Greeke Knight hath two Knights more in his company, who are determined likewiſe to combate for the loue of their Ladies, againſt all ſuch as dare encounter with them, and they deſire alſo ſecurity from your Highnes, for their ſafe comming and returning. Faire friend, anſwered the King, you ſhall haue all that you can requeſt, and I am well pleaſed that it ſhould bee ſo.
                  Sir then (quoth ſhe) reſt your ſelfe aſſured, that you ſhall ſee them all here to morrow morning, in the company of her, who thinkes her ſelfe to be the onely beauty in the world. Wherefore Madame (ſaid ſhe to the Queene,) cauſe your choyceſt Ladies, to put on their richeſt accoutrements, and not to forget any thing that may illuſtrate their perfections, if they hope to gaine any glory from her.
                  So, taking her leaue, ſhe mounted on her Palfray, and returned directly the ſame way ſhe came; where finding the Barke awayting for her, ſhe went aboord, and had the winde ſo fitting for her, that ſhe was quickly with Graſinda, to whom at large ſhee reported, all that had paſſed betweene King Liſuart and her, who had graunted all that ſhe requeſted. Hereupon, the Greeke knight was minded to haue their Tents and Pauilions forth-with erected ſo neere to the Towne as might be; and therefore concluded, that both he and all his company would goe on land the day following. But heere I muſt tell ye, that ſo ſoone as the Damoſell meſſenger was departed from the Court, the Prince Saluſte Quide, who had bin preſent at the whole conference, and heard what anſwere was made her, ſtepped forth with other Romaine Knights, and falling on his knee before the King, ſaide as followeth.
                  Sir, we that are Romaines, and ſtrangers here in your Country, do moſt humbly beg one boone, which we muſt needs craue of your Maieſty, redounding highly to your honour and benefit. Truely Sir, anſwered the King, there is no reaſon then, that it ſhould be denyed you. All of them gaue him moſt hearty thankes, and then the Prince proceeded on thus. Let it then bee pleaſing to your Highnes, that we ſtrangers may maintaine the cauſe for ſo many faire Maides, as are here preſent in your Court. And if Heauen be as fauourable to vs, as equity and reaſon ſhall ſhew themſelues gracious in our attempt: we make no doubt, but to effect this buſines much better, then any of your Knights can doe, becauſe our long acquaintance with the Greeks man-hood, hath ſufficiently inſtructed vs, how to deale with them, being men commonly ouercome by vs, as our manifold encounters can well witneſſe, and their very name ſhall more renowne our chiualry, then any effect whatſoeuer can enſue by them, to the men of this Country, although they were all to grapple with them.
                  
                     Don Grumedan hearing the preſumption of the Romane, and with what audaciouſnes he ſpake, could not endure it, but riſing vp, thus hee ſaid to the King. Albeit Sir, it is very high honour to Princes, when ſuch ſtrange aduentures happen in their Courts, whereby their renown and magnificence may be the more augmented: yet notwithſtanding, many times they returne to their

ſcandall and diſgrace, if they be not embraced with ſuch diſcretion and reuerence, as is euer more required in all potent Kings. I ſpeake theſe words Sir, for the Greeke Knight, who is ſo lately come into your land, vnder hope of performing ſuch matters as hee hath acquainted you withall: wherein if he ſhall preuaile, and conquer them that would contend againſt him, though the danger will be theirs, yet the ſhame and diſhonour muſt be yours. Wherefore, if you were ſo pleaſed, all ſhould be deferred till the comming of Galaor and Norandell, who will be heere within foure or fiue daies, as I am credibly enformed by ſome Knights that haue ſeene them. And by that time alſo, Guillan the Penſiue will be recouered, and able to beare Armes: which (in mine opinion) would fall out better for you, becauſe they are meeteſt men to confront any challenger, and to defend the honor and reputation of your Court, with all the beauties therein abyding.
                  The King ſuddenly ſtarting vp, replied. This may not be graunted, becauſe my promiſe is already paſt to the Prince Saluſte Quide, and theſe other Gentlemen his companions, who muſt be the protectours of our beſt beauties, and are able to anſwere a more high and daungerous enterpriſe, then this is or can be. It may be ſo, ſaid Grumedan: but I am well aſſured, that none of our Ladies or Damoſells will conſent thereto. Let it ſuffice then (quoth the King) that I will graunt to nothing elſe for them, then as alreadie I haue determined, and my word paſt for it. Hereupon, Saluſte Quide thanking the king moſt humbly, addreſſed himſelf to Grumedan, ſaying. Lord Grumedan, you may ſay what pleaſe you: neuertheleſſe, I hope to winne the honor for theſe Ladies, and to ouercome the Greek Knight in Combate, of whom you make ſo great account. And becauſe there are two other Knights in his company, of no leſſe valour and proweſſe then hee, as I am giuen to vnderſtand: I am well pleaſed to Combat againſt them, and you if you haue any wil to take their part: prouided, that two of my companions may ioyne with mee. By this meanes it will be apparantly diſcerned, to whom the honour of victory ſhall fall: the fight being equall, of three Romaines, againſt two Greekes and a Knight of great Brittaine.
                  
                     Grumedan ſmiling at the Princes pride, returned this anſwer. It were ſhame for me to make refuſall, therfore I accept your offer I, and thoſe two that ſhall take my part. Thus ſpeaking, he drew a Ring from off his finger, and making a low reuerence to the King, ſaid. Behould Sir, here is my gage, which moſt humbly I beſeech you to receiue, on the behalfe of mee and my companions; as in iuſtice you can doe little leſſe, the Prince Saluſte hauing challenged the combat, as you your ſelfe haue heard; otherwiſe, hee muſt either vnſay his words, or yeeld him ſelfe vanquiſhed. By God, ſaid Saluſte, ſooner ſhall the Seas be dryed vp, then the word of a Romaine be retracted, or the leaſt iniury done to his honour. And I doe much meruaile Grumedan, that you dare ſpeak words ſo voyd of reaſon: but if age haue made your ſences faile you, your body muſt iuſtly pay the penance in combate, for ſpeeches ſo indiſcreetly deliuered. Surely Sir, anſwered Grumedan, I am yet yong enough, to bring mine enterpriſe

to a good iſſue, and to gaine that from you, which you imagine to get ouer-eaſily from me. And let me plainly tell you, that mine age hath taught me more experience, then euer, young pride or preſumption could learne, as I hope is ſufficiently ſeene in you, by the proud perſwaſion you haue of your ſelfe, who rather appeares to be a Captaine of Braggards
                        •
                     , then a man to performe any matter indeed.
                  With theſe words aroſe vp King Arban, & more then thirty Knights beſide, to take the cauſe in hand, & to maintaine what Grumedan had ſpoken: but the King impoſed ſilence on them, commanding them (on perill of their liues) not to vſe anymore ſuch words in his preſence. Whereupon, euery man departed to his lodging, leauing Count Argamont alone with the king, to whom he ſpake in this manner. Sir, haue you not obſerued the audacious inſolence of theſe Romanes, and how vnreuerently they dare abuſe the knights of your Court? In your own iudgement, they that are ſo mallepert here, what will they not doe in other places? In good faith Sir, ſeeing they declare ſo litle diſcretion, I greatly feare their behauiour to the Princoſſe Oriana, euen ſo ſoone as you ſhall haue loſt ſight of her. And yet notwithſtanding (as I hear) you haue already giuen them your grant for her, which makes mee to meruaile not a little, whence this ſtrange fancie in you ſhould proceed, conſidering, that neuer did any Prince (ſo wiſe and & iudicious as you haue alwayes bin eſteemed) ſo far forget himſelf, wherby plainly appeareth, that you are deſirous to tempt your own good fortune, & to let looſe the reines of diuers diſaſters, very ominous to this whole kingdome. Haue you forgottē, what eſpeciall graces our Lord hath (in a maner) heaped vpon you? And doe you not ſtand in feare of his anger? Fortune, is not ſhe mutable? Are you now to learne, that when ſhee growes weary of good turns to him whom ſhe hath exalted, ſhe wil chaſtiſe him afterward with many ſtripes, yee, with ſuch cruel tortures, as are a thouſand times worſe then death? Pardon me Sir, I beſeech you, if the faith I beare you, haue made me thus bold; to ſpeake ſuch words, as (perhaps) you like not: you are not ignorant, how tranſitory the matters of this world are, and that all the renowne & glory, which by long and tedious trauell can bee gotten in this life, is oftentimes quenched and quite buried, vpon a very ſmall occaſion, if Fortune doe but once diſtaſte the perſon. So that if any remembrance remaine of a mans former felicity, this blame will only liue vpon him, that hee did not make vſe of his precedent happines, but rather entertayned it with an idle and negligent reſpect.
                  Pauſing here a while, and hearing the King to returne no anſwere, hee began againe thus. Sir, doe but thinke on the fault you ſometime fell into, by baniſhing ſo many good Knights farre hence, as Amadis, his brethren, kinred and friendes, by whom you were feared, honoured and reſpected euery-where. And being ſcarcely freed from this miſhap, will you voluntarily fall into a worſe? Vndoubtedly I muſt needes imagine, that God and all good ſucceſſe hath forſaken you, becauſe you haue firſt forſaken him. For, if it were otherwiſe, you would accept the counſell of them, that deſire to liue no longer, then in loue & faithfull ſeruice to you. But ſeeing what I doe, I am content to diſcharge the homage and duty I owe you,

and with-draw my ſelfe into mine owne territories: becauſe I will auoyde (ſo much as poſſibly I may) the iuſt complaints and teares of your Daughter Oriana, at ſuch time as you deliuer her, according to your promiſe, and the manifold miſeries that will enſue thereon, to your diſhonour, and woefull ouer-throw of this famous Realme.
                  Vncle, replied the King, that which is done, is done, were I to dye, I will not falſifie my word. But I pray you to abide heere two or three dayes longer, to ſee what iſſue theſe new-attempted Combats will ſort vnto: becauſe I elect you as Iudge of theſe exploytes, with ſuch beſide as your ſelf ſhal make choyſe of. Heerein you ſhall yeeld mee great contentment, and ſuch ſeruice as cannot be more acceptable, becauſe we haue no one heere, that vnderſtandeth the Greeke language better then you doe. Sir (quoth Count Argamont) ſeeing ſuch is your pleaſure, farre be it from me to contradict it: yet vnder this condition, that afterward, you will diſpenſe with my departure; for it will be impoſſible for me to abide among ſuch grieuous mournings, as muſt needs ſucceed this hea
                        •
                     y fortune.
                  So breaking off their diſcourſe, by reaſon of the Prince Saluſte Quides comming: Count Argamont with-drew himſelfe, leauing the King and Prince in priuate conference. Now, we may not bee vnmindfull of Laſinde, the Squire to Don Bruneo, who compaſſed ſo good meanes, that he attained to true intelligence, of all matters and conference, ſince the Damoſell-Meſſengers departure. Wherefore, ſeeing the night faſt haſtening on, ſecretly he left the Court, and made his ſpeedy paſſage by Boate to the Greeke knight, whom he acquainted with the Prince Saluſtes requeſt to the King, the anſwere of Don Grumedan, and all things elſe in their due proceeding. This fell out to his no little comfort; and ſo much the rather, becauſe now hee knew he ſhould meddle with none but Romanes: whereas he feared before, that either his brother Galaor, or ſome other as worthy a Knight of Great Brittaine, would ſteppe into his place on the Ladies behalfe. And then hee knew too well, that neuer could the fight be ended, either without his death, or ſome other of his deareſt friends, or (it might be) of both together. But theſe doubts being ſomewhat aſſwaged, he thought the time ouer long, till hee was at the combate; whereupon hee ſaid to Graſinda. Madame, if you bee ſo pleaſed, to morrow morning wee will earely heare Maſſe in our Pauilions, and then take our way towardes King Liſuart, with ſuch attendants as you ſhall appoint: and I make no queſtion, but (by the helpe of heauen) you ſhall obtaine your long-wiſhed deſire. Whereto ſhe readily condiſcended.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XVI.
                  
                     How the Greeke Knight and his confederates, conducted the faire Graſinda to the place where the Combates were to be perfourmed; And of that which enſued thereon.
                  
                  
                     LIttle reſt tooke Graſinda all this night, and much leſſe the Greeke Knight, in regard of eithers earneſt longing, to haue this enterpriſe ſucceſſiuely accompliſhed. Wherefore by breake of day the next morning, they were conueyed aſhoare, with the company appointed to attend vpon them: and after they had deuoutly heard Maſſe, they all mounted on horſebacke, ſhaping their courſe to the Towne of Tagades, where King Liſuart with his Lords, exſpected their arriuall. Now, you need not make any doubt, but that Graſinda was moſt rich and ſumptuous in her attire and habit, as hoping (by the helpe of her Knight) to winne the like honour from the Maydes and Virgins of Great Brittaine, as ſhee had done from the faireſt women of Romania. And perſwade your ſelues beſide, that if ſhe were ſo reſpectiue of her owne adornements, ſhe failed not in the like care for her followers: eſpecially her Ladies and Gentlewomen, which gaue good teſtimony to all ſuch as ſaw them, that their M

                     is was a moſt rich and worthy Lady. And yet the more to embelliſh her beautie, ſhe woare a coaſtly rich Crowne on her head, which had bi
                        •
                      long before conquered for her, in the manifeſtation of her beauty.
                  Cloſe by her ſide rode the Greeke Knight, in very honourable equipage, hauing on a rich Armour couered with a coate of Armes of his owne colours. Next to him followed Brunco, bearing a Shield of Sinople, in the midſt whereof was figured a faire Damoſell, with a Knight on his knees before her, as ſeeming to require mercy and fauor of her, his Armour being all ouerwauie with gold. By him rode Angriose, mounted on a gallant Courſer, armed likewiſe with a coſtly Armour, all thicke ſeamed ouer with flowres of gold: and he guided the Damoſell, that had bin Meſſenger to king Liſuart the day before. In this manner came Graſinda, to the place appointed by the King for this buſines, in the midſt wherof was raiſed a ſquare baſe of black marble, containing the height of a man; wherupon, he that intended to enter the Combat, was to fixe either his Helmet, Shield, Gauntlet, or elſe ſome greene branch. The Greeke knight looking on all ſides about him, beheld the King, and many knights of Great Brittaine, but moſt he obſerued the Prince Saluſt Quide, in an Armor thick ſeamed with Serpents, which made him ſeeme ſo great of ſtature, and being mounted alſo on a Horſe of huge aduantage, that he appeared to be a Giant. Thē liſting vp his eies, he ſaw the Queen, & a faire troup of Ladies about her, each one wearing a rich Crowne on her head. But he could not ſee there his Oriana, which beganne to touch him ſomewhat in ſoule: wherefore he turned head to Graſinda, who hauing her eye fixed on the Prince Saluſte Quide, he could eaſily gather thereby, that ſhe was in great doubt of her ſucceſſe, when ſmiling to him ſelfe, he thus ſpake to her. It appeareth to me Madame, that the huge

forme of this Knight makes you fearefull of my fortune: notwithſtanding, before he and I part hence, I ſhall let you plainly perceiue, that although hee is higher mounted then I am, I haue a heart as intire and able as his, and right conſiſting on our ſide, the victory muſt needs be ours. Heauen ſtand ſo fauourable for you, anſwered Graſinda.
                  
                  Then the Knight took the Crown which ſhe woare on her head, and ryding gently toward the ſquare baſe, placed it thereon: afterward, returning to his Squire, who had three mighty ſtrong Launces (each hauing a little Penon at the point, enriched with faire flottes of fine gold,) and taking which of them he beſt liked, rode afterward to the King, ſpeaking thus to him in the Greeke tongue. Moſt excellent King, I ſalute you as the onely abſolute Prince on the earth. Know that I am a knight of a ſtrange Nation, as my outward appearance makes manifeſt to you, and I by commaund of the Lady (who onely hath power ouer me) am come into this Country, to approue my fortune againſt the knights of your Court, ſo great is their fame and renowne in all places. But for ought I can perceiue, my intent is wholly fruſtrated, and you haue graunted that to Romanes, which I deſired of your owne.
                  But ſeeing it is ſo, and that it may bee none otherwiſe: may it ſtand with your Highnes liking (without any further waſte of time) to commaund him that firſt intends the combat, to take the Ladies Crown, whoſe cauſe hee meaneth to maintaine, and to place it on the P

                        rrou, according as alreadie I haue done mine.
                  Hauing ſpoken theſe words, hee gaue the ſpurre to his Courſer, and made him bound, curuet and carriere ſo dexteriouſly before them, and with ſuch a commendable pleaſing performance, as euery eye took delight to behold him, with no meane praiſes a
                        •
                     d commendations. Afterward, hauing attained the length of the field, hee turned with an extraordinary gallant grace, exſpecting who durſt firſt preſent himſelfe.
                  Now, the King knew not what all this while had beene ſpoken to him, becauſe he vnderſtood not the Greeke language: wherfore Count Argamont, who ſtood neer
                        •
                     ſt to him, interpreted all that had beene ſaid, with this addition of his owne. In good faith Sir, quoth he, it would highly pleaſe me, to ſee the ouer-daring pride of the Romanes, a little qualified by this Grecian knight. Before God, anſwered the king, wee ſhall annon behold one of the ſtearneſt encounters, that euer was ſeene in this land: for I perceiue the Prince Saluſte Quide, already is entred into the Liſts. And to ſpeake truely, he aduanced himſelfe very proudly, enuious and much diſpleaſed, to heare what praiſes were generally giuen of the Greeke knight, which made him rate and reuile the people, crying out againſt them, ſaying: Fye on ye fooliſh ſottes, I diots, and beetle headed Brittaines, what mooues you to this ſenceleſſe admiration, of a blockiſh paltrie companion, that ſhewes all the wit and courage he hath, in tormenting a poore horſe vpon no occaſion? Before God, if he were a man of any wiſdom, he would make more ſpare of him, for the better defending him ſelfe againſt me, or elſe for his ſpeedier flight, before he be therto compelled. Alas poore ignorant people, you expreſſe your great want of knowledge, concerning the name of

a Romaine, who is ſo dreaded throughout all the Eaſt, as there is no Greeke Knight ſo hardie and aduenturous, that dare contend with a Knight of Rome. Alas, I ſee the death of this miſerable vnfortunate fellow, whom I ſhal ſo boyſterouſly ouer-throw at the firſt blow, that the very reines of his backe will flye in ſunder: and not onely the Crowne muſt be my boory, but the glorious Lady alſo, who hath taken ſo much paine and trauaile, to come hither into this Country, heere to receiue perpetuall ſhame and infamie.
                  Speaking thus, he rode toward the Ladies; and addreſſing himſelfe to Olinda, demaunded of her, if ſhe pleaſed to deliuer him her Crowne, that thereby hee might defend her beautie. For, in mine opinion (quoth he) any man of good iudgement will confeſſe, that iuſtly you ought to haue that other Crowne, which the fond Greeke hath placed on the Perrou. Moreouer, I haue made choyce of you, among all the reſt, to be my beſt beloued; wherefore I beſeech you grant me leaue, that I may begin the Combate for you, as ſhe to whom I am vowed and dedicated. For, no ſooner ſhall the Empreſſe haue made her entrance into the great City of Rome: but there I meane to make you my wife, as ſole Lady and gouerneſſe of me, and all my greateſt fortunes.
                  
                     Olinda, tired and much troubled with this idle talke of Saluſte Quide, made him no anſwere; but turning her face another way, feigned a conference with one of her owne company: which the Prince perceiuing, as halfe in anger, thus he ſpake to her. It ſeemeth Madame, by your manner of behauiour, that I am a man vnable to execute what I haue ſpoken: but let mee neuer haue loue, or any eſteeme of you, if I doe not perfourme much more. Only this being granted, that my firſt encounter with the Launce, may haue but your gracious looke, and that you turne not your face till it be done. This earneſt importunity did ſo embelliſh the beautie of Olinda, by a moſt ſweet and amiable bluſh: that ſhe knew not how to bee rid of this vexation, making no account at all of his words. Which the Queene obſeruing, ſhe took the Crowne from her head, and ſent it to the Prince Saluſte▪
                      who receiuing it very thankfully, went to the baſe or Perron, and ſet it by that belonging to Graſinda.
                  
                  Afterward, taking a ſtrong Lance, he beganne to ſhake it in ſuch ſort, as if he meant to ſnap it in ſunder: then ryding proudly to the King, with his Helmet on his head, and Shield about his necke, thus hee ſpake. King Liſuart, I ſhall ſoone let you ſee the difference, betweene vs that are Romanes, & the Knights of your Court: for this braue preſuming Greeke, that thinkes to combate with ſo many one after another, ſhal preſently receiue the greateſt ſhame that euer Knight did. And then, let his other two companions come if they pleaſe, to reuenge his cauſe if they can: for this I dare promiſe you, that before I depart from hence, I will preſent you with their heads, inſteed of Crowns.
                  So much offended was Grumedan, at theſe arrogant proud wordes of Sa
                           •
                        uſte; as he could hardly forbeare to ſmite him. Neuertheleſſe, in regard of the Kings ſtrict countermaundes before, he diſſembled his anger, and went to him only with this anſwere. Lord Saluſte, you haue not yet forgot the Combate, that muſt bee betweene you and me, if (as you ſay) you eſcape from the Greek, & come fairely off

My memorie is more perfect then ſo, replyed Prince Saluſte, and your ſelfe ſhall haue good cauſe to remember it.
                  So cloſing his beauer, claſping cloſe his Shield, and placing his Launce in the reſt, he ranne mainly againſt the Greeke Knight, who met him with ſuch force (neither of them failing in the attaint) that Saluſte was vnhorſed: and our Greeke Knight finiſhing his race, found a truncheon of the Launces ſhaft ſticking in his Shield, whereby euery man thought that hee had beene wounded. But hee quickly declared, that there was no ſuch matter, and ſnatching it out, threw it on the ground, turning againe to meete with his enemie, who moued neither hand nor foot, he was ſo daunted with the fall. And not without great cauſe, conſidering what a height he fell, and the heauy charge of his armour, ſo that his right arme was broken in twaine. And yet it happened farre worſe to him; for in falling downe, his left foot hung faſt in the ſtirrop, and being vnable to get it forth, his horſe offended at his vnfaſhionable burden, gaue him ſuch a blow with his foote on the Helmet, that it fell off from his head, and he lay ſtill as one entranced.
                  The Greeke Knight beholding him in this pittifull condition, ſpake out ſo loud, as euery one might heare him. Beleeue me gentle Romaine, the Lady for whom you haue performed this rare chiualry, is wonderfully beholding to you: notwithſtanding, if you doe not quit her Crown from my Miſtreſſe, (who deſerues it better then ſhe, as excelling all in beautie) you lye fairely for the loſſe of your head preſently. But Saluſte made him not any anſwere; whereupon the Knight rode to the King, thus ſpeaking in Greeke to him: Sir, he that ſo lately gaue perſwaſions to your people, to relye confidently in his manhood, will not now render his Ladies Crowne to my Miſtreſſe, to whom (by the teſtimony of all preſent) it iuſtly appertaineth. Wherefore, may it pleaſe you (as an vpright Iudge) to doe me right: otherwiſe, I will ſmite off his head before this faire aſſembly. Then ſuddenly turning bridle, and alighting from his horſe, he went to Prince Saluſte, making ſhewe, as if he meant to kill him.
                  Which Count Argamont ſeeing, ſaid to the King. Sir, you ought (in my minde to graunt the Greeke Knight what he demaundeth, and ſaue the life of the other, elſe you may heereafter bee blamed for it. And why? anſwerd Grumedan. I pray you Lord Argamont, let Fortune deale as pleaſeth her. Haue you not yet ſeene enough of theſe Romaines ſaucineſſe? I proteſt to you vpon my faith, that with their peremptorie audaciouſneſſe, they are become as malicious as olde Monkies, and you ſhall perceiue it by experience, if the Greeke Knight bee hindred from purſuing his victory. For although Saluſte be ſo neere his ending, yet I dare giue you all my lands and goods, if the King doe ſaue him: that he will iuſtly ſay hereafter, he ſaued him from death, that will bee the greateſt enemie to his life. Therefore, I beſeech you Sir, delay your ſentence for a while, till it may be certainely knowen, what will bee the iſſue of the fight.
                  During this diſcourſe, the Greek Knight made ſhew of diſarming Saluſte, for more eaſie ſmiting off his head from his ſhoulders: which the King fearing, prayed his Vnckle to

vrge the ſtay, and to graunt him the Crowne which hee deſired. Then the olde Earle aroſe, and tolde him in the Greek tongue, what the King had commanded him. Heereupon, the Knight ſtept backe, and putting his Sword vp into the ſheath, ſpake to the Count in this manner. In honour of ſo good a King, and you, for once I will ſaue the life of this preſumptuous Romane. Neuertheleſſe, if any of his companions fall into the like danger, let them be well aſſured, that they muſt make amends for him. For I neuer heard of any vaine-glory like to theirs, wherein they haue gotten an habite and cuſtome, to condemne any Knight errant, in reſpect of their owne worthineſſe.
                  Moreouer Sir, I pray you tell the King, that for the much good I haue heard of him, I ſhall neuer bee willing to yeeld him any diſcontent, or enter into any ſeruice hurtfull to him. But withall, I humbly entreate him, to fauour me in the proſecution of my victory, if others ſhall preſent themſelues for the Combat: to the end, that hereafter they may not bee forward in deſpiſing other men, after the manner of the Emperor Patin; who hath great delight in threatning others, and yet beares away the blowes ſhamefully himſelfe, like to theſe Bragadochiaes of his band.
                  So mounting on horſebacke, he rode to the ſquare Perrou, whence he tooke the two Crownes, and carried them to Graſinda, who (you muſt needes preſume) was extraordinarily pleaſed; and thanking the Knight heartily, prayed him to proceede on, ſince he had begunne ſo well.
                  Then calling for a new Launce, which ſpeedily was brought him, he returned to the end of the Liſts, attending when another ſhould come offer himſelfe. And ſeeing no man ſtirre, being wearie of ſo long wayting, he called for the Damoſell Meſſenger, that brought the Letter to Court, ſaying thus to her. Faire friend, I pray you goe to the King, and tell him, that I moſt humbly deſire him, if the Romanes will combate no more, that he ſuffer not any of his Court to ſupply their defect: for, ouer and beſide the ſmal honour they ſhall gaine, by vanquiſhing ſo ſilly a Knight as I am, yet at this time, I am not willing to meddle with them. But, if any of the other will reuenge their companions diſgrace, I am heere ready to receiue them all, one after another; yea, or two of the very beſt of them both together. The Damoſell rode preſently to the King, and deliuered all that the Greeke Knight had committed to her truſt, where-to he anſwered: That hee was well pleaſed with his motion, conſidering the great impoſition layde vppon him by his Lady. And if hee liked to loue him, and be one of his followers, he would honour him as highly as any Knight of his Court. Moreouer (quoth the King) aſſure him from me, that he ſhall ſuffer iniury by Combate, againſt none other then the Romaines, who earneſtly craued it at my hands. And he had great reaſon for this anſwer, becauſe he had then no Knight able to contend with the Grecian: For all were abſent from the Court, in regard of the tempeſtuous troubles, except Guillan le Penſif, who was then ſicke, and Cendile de Ganote, who the day before (by an vnluckie accident) was ſhot through both his legges with an arrow, as the King came to the fall of a Hart.
                  This anſwere being vnderſtood

by the Damoſel like a wiſe & diſcreet Gentlewoman, humbly thanked the King, ſaying further, thus. Sir, if the Greeke knight could ſo eaſily haue beene entreated, the Emperour of Conſtantinople had not ſo ſoone loſt him: but hee will neuer ſubiect himſelfe to any, as hauing more affected liberty, then all the goods and treaſures of the world. And thus aſſure yourſelfe, that his onely deſire and felicity, is, to defend the right of Ladies and Gentlewomen, in preſeruing them from wrong or abuſe offered to them: in which honourable imployment, he hath wonne ſuch immortall fame and renowne, in manifold difficult and dangerous attempts, as the ſeuerall reports would ſeeme incredible. So, with your anſwere I will returne to him, or any ſeruice elſe you pleaſe to commaund me: giuing you further to vnderſtand, that, till it be midday, he will attend them that dare aduenture the Combate, but afterward he ſhall hardly ſtay, or admit any ſuch leyſure.
                  Then ſhe returned to the Greeke knight, who hauing heard the Kings anſwere, went to Graſinda, ſaying. For ought I can perceiue, Madame, the Crowne is your owne franke and free, and I clear'd from all further danger of the Romanes: neuertheleſſe, in expreſſion of my dutie to you, I will tarry yet a litle longer, to ſee if any of them haue the heart to aduenture his fortune. Hauing thus ſpoken, he called one of his Squires, and ſaid to him. Carry my Shield, and ſet it on the Perrou; then proclaime aloude, that if there be any other Romaine, who is willing to enter the Combate, let him come and aduance his Shield by mine.
                  The Squire did as hee was commanded, yet (for all this) not a man of them would ſtirre, but ſtood looking one vpon another: eſpecially Maganill, who (among the Romanes) was reputed for one of the beſt Knights in the world, yet being very fearefull of the Greeke, and willing to excuſe himſelfe, he thus ſpake to his other companions.
                  You know, my friends, that yeſterday the Prince Saluſte Quide vndertooke the Combate againſt Grumedan, and I made him promiſe, that if he were vanquiſhed by him, that I and my two brethren would reuenge his cauſe: therefore (of neceſſitie) I may not now aduenture. But I am much amazed at you all, to ſee you ſo voide of heart and courage, as to ſtand like men confounded in ſoule, at one onely encounter of the Launce perfourmed by the Greeke.
                  Then he called to Gradamor and Lazanor, two young Romaine Knights, of ſpirit enough, and ſaid to them. Me thinkes you are too ſlow in aduenturing your fortunes. You ſee, the Greeke make proffer of combatting with any two among vs, and I am very certaine, that if you two will accept his challenge, hee ſhall finde it no eaſie matter to deale with you; let mee therefore perſwade you to vndertake him.
                  Theſe words did ſo puffe them vp with a vaine conceit of themſelues, as they called immediatly for their Armes, and entring into the Liſts very boldly, depending more vpon preſumption, then any mannerly education, paſſed by before the king, without any offer of ſalutation, or ſeeming ſo much as to ſee him. Then ryding to the Perrou, Gradamor (in very deſpightfull manner) hauing his Sword drawen in his hand, ſmote with all his force at the Greeke knights Shield aduaunced

thereon, and brake it in pieces, crying ſo loud as he could. Ill may be thriue, that ſuffers any longer this ſaucie mates Armes to ſtand heere ſo proudly.
                  When the Greeke Knight both heard and ſaw this iniurie, he grew ſo highly offended, that, without ſtaying to call for another Shield, he tooke a new Launce, and giuing the ſpuries to his horſe, met the two Romaine Knights ſo couragiouſly, that one of them was throwne to the ground ſo amazedly, as he knew not whether it was day or night, and euery man thought that his necke was broken, hee lay ſo quietly.
                  Now, becauſe our Greekes Launce was ſhiuered in many pieces, he drew his Sword, and turning his face to Lazanor, loaded him with ſuch mighty ſtrokes, as, if hee had not caught faſt hold on the maine of his horſe, hee had falne to the earth. But as he lay thus bowing, the Greeke ſeized on his body, and by meere ſtrength of arme (tearing the Shield from about his necke) hee threw him againſt the ground. Neuertheleſſe, quickly he receiued footing, and went to helpe vp his brother: In this time the Greeke was diſmounted from his horſe, which he feared to looſe, becauſe he ran about the fielde: but minding more his preſent buſines, hee ranne pell mell vpon his enemies, laying ſo ſtearnely about him on euery ſide, as they were no way able to endure him. Now gaue he good teſtimony of his valour, and that hee was no learner in ſuch extremities: but as one of the Romanes was running about the Perrou, and the other following ſpeedily after him, onely to auoide the Greekes keene edged Sword, hee gaue Lazanor ſuch a ſtroake on the right leg, as it was well neere cut in twaine, ſo that meere paine and anguiſh made him fall downe, and piteouſly he craued mercy.
                  But the Greeke Knight pretending, that either he heard or vnderſtood him not, he ſet his foot on his breſt, and ſo left him ſtretcht out along on the ground, returning to Gradamor, who fled to the king for warrantie of his life. All which would not ſerue his turne; for with his Sword, he did beat him backe againe to the Perrou, where being quite out of breath, he fell downe all along: where the Greeke ſetting foote on him, ſmote ſo many blowes on his Helmet, that it fell off from his head, which hauing now at ſo apt aduantage, he purpoſed to ſmite from his ſhoulders, but that the other cryed out to him. Ah gentle knight, for Gods ſake mercy, I am ready to doe whatſoeuer you ſhall command me.
                  Remoouing his foote from off him, he ſuddenly looked back, and eſpied Lazanor creeping on his knees to ſteale away: but he quickly caught hold on his arme, and dragd him along to the Perrou, laying him cloſe by his brother Gradamor, which made euery one imagine, that there he would ſmite off their heads together. Whereupon Don Grumedan, who hated them to the death, ſpake out ſo loud, as euery man might eaſily heare him. Mee thinkes the Greeke hath ſo well reuenged the wrong done to his Shield, as Gradamor hath good cauſe to remember it while he
                        •
                      liues.
                  As he ſpake theſe words, Eſplandian came to him, and the Greeke demaunded what hee would haue. Sir, anſwered Eſplandian, I beſeech you (for my ſake) ſpare the liues of theſe two Knights, ſeeing they

yeeld themſelues as vanquiſhed. But he feigned as if hee vnderſtood him not: wherfore Eſplandian prayed Count Argamont, to interprete for him, which he did. Truely Sir, (quoth the Greeke) I will gladly beſtow their liues on this ſweet youth, prouided, that you will tell mee of whence, and what he is. Beleeue me Sir, replyed the Count, I know not any man in this Court, that heerein can reſolue you, for he was brought hither almoſt by miracle. Then briefly he reported, how, and in what manner the aged Hermite found him.
                  I haue often heard of him, ſaid the Greeke, in Romania, and that he is named Eſplandian, by reaſon of certaine naturall letters or carracters vnder his breſts. You ſay true, anſwered the Count, and you ſhall ſee them preſently, if you pleaſe. So he commanded Eſplandian to ſhew his breſts, as accordingly he did: whereat the Knight not a little meruayling, ſaid. Faire youth, I pray God to bleſſe thee, and ſend thee good fortune in the higheſt degree.
                  So mounting on horſe-backe againe, he left the Romaines with young Eſplandian, and returned to Graſinda, ſaying. Beleeue me Madame, I haue beene ouer-troubleſome to you, but I was compelled thereto (as your ſelfe hath ſeene) and could make no ſpeedier diſpatch.
                  Vpon my faith, anſwered ſhe, you can neuer doe any thing, but I ſhall very thankfully accept it, let vs now then goe on-ward, if you pleaſe. So getting forth of the crowd, they tooke the way to their Shippes, in ſo high content on all ſides, as poſſibly could be. Being come aboord, they commanded the Mariners, to ſet ſaile for the Encloſed Iſle. But becauſe the Greeke Knight had ſome ſuſpition, that Don Grumedan would ſtand in need of Knights helpe, to maintaine the Combat, which he had vndertaken, if ſo be it ſhould go forward, he deſired Angriote and Bruneo, to ſtay behind, & ſuccor him, & in the meane while to vnderſtand ſome tydings of Oriana, if any way they could attaine thereto.
               
               
                  CHAP. XVII.
                  
                     How King Liſuart ſent for his Daughter Oriana to the Court, that he might deliuer her to the Romanes. And of that which happened to a Knight of the Encloſed Iſle: But more eſpecially, of the Combat which Don Grumedan had againſt them that defied him.
                  
                  
                     ALready hath beene declared to you, that the Princeſſe Oriana being at Mirefleure, the Queene Sardamira (by the conſent of King Liſuart) went thither to ſee her, and to acquaint her with the Emperours affection towards her, as alſo with what magnificence ſhe ſhould be wel-comed to Rome. Now, in the proſecution of our Hiſtory, you muſt vnderſtand, that after full concluſion was paſt with the Romanes, concerning her: the King would haue her come to the Court, commanding his Nephew Giontes, to take two Knights more with him, & bring her thence away with all conuenient ſpeed. But he gaue him charge (vpon perill

of his life) that none, but they of her owne company, ſhould haue any conference with her.
                  For execution of the Kings command, Giontes tooke Sadoce and Lazanor with him; who being come to Mirefleure, after they had acquainted her with her fathers purpoſe, they made ready a Litter for her, becauſe otherwiſe ſhee was vnable to trauaile, ſhe was ſo weake and ſickly, by reaſon of her continual mourning; yet on ſhe needes muſt, accompanied with the Queene Sardamira, and other Ladies. Betweene Mirefleure and Tagades, where the King ſoiourned, approaching nere to a goodly Fountaine, enuironed with diuers young ſpreading trees, they eſpyed in a little groue, a Knight, ready prepared for Combate, bearing a Shield of Sinople, and a Launce, with a Banderole or Pennon of the ſame colour: who calling to one of his Squires, ſaid. Goe, and tell them that guard Madame Oriana, that (in courteſie) I entreate them, to let me ſpeake a word with her; elſe, I will ſtriue to doe it, whether they will or no. The Squire going to Giontes, told him as his Maſter had commanded him: whereat he beganne to laugh hartily, that he (being alone) ſhould ſend them ſuch a threatning braue; wherefore hee gaue them this anſwere: Friend, returne to the Knight, and tell him, that he cannot (at this time) ſpeake with Madame Oriana: moreouer, that if hee contend violently to doe it, he will not find it eaſie for him.
                  When Oriana heard theſe words, ſhe tooke them very vnkindly, and ſaid to Giontes: Fair Sir, why ſhould you be offended at any mans ſpeaking with me? Perhaps he brings me ſuch good newes, as may be very pleaſing to me. Madame, (quoth he) the King hath commaunded vs on our liues, that no one may come neere your perſon, much leſſe ſpeak with you, vntill you come to him.
                  The Squire returned his anſwere to his Maſter; in the meane while Giontes, miſdoubting that hee muſt needes try the Combate, made him ready for it. As readily came the Knight (who ſtiled himſelfe the Greene Knight) into the fielde, and both giuing the ſpurre to their horſes, met together ſo furiouſly, that their Launces flew in pieces, and Giontes his horſe being ſhouldered, fell to the ground with his Maiſter vnder him, ſo that he could not readily recouer himſelfe. Whereupon the Greene Knight trotting to him, deſired him once more, that hee would permit him to ſpeake with Oriana. By my faith Sir, anſwered Giontes, if you do, it is much againſt my will, and by this miſ-fortune of my horſe.
                  Hardly had he concluded theſe words, but the Greene knight heard Sadoce crying, that hee ſhould ſtand vpon his guard. Wherefore, leauing Giontes, he ranne againſt the other, and failed in the attaint: which Sadoce did not, but met him ſo manfully, that his Launce flew in infinit pieces. The Greene knight, angry at his miſſe, took another Lance, and giuing his horſe the ſpurre, met Sadoce ſo powerfully, that hee caſt him quite out of his ſaddle. Which Lazanor ſeeing, and hoping to bee reuenged for his two companions, couched his Launce againſt the Greene Knight, with full perſwaſion to vnhorſe him: but they encountred ſo furiouſly with their bodies, that Lazanors arme was broken, and hee ſate ſo amazedly on his horſe, as hee had not the power to ſtay him, till hee had runne out his

whole race, becauſe the Greene Knight (in his paſſage by him) had pluckt the bridle off his head, and ſeeing him runne in that confuſed manner, he fell a laughing at him.
                  Then came he to Oriana, and humbly ſaluting her, ſhee imagined him to be Amadis: wherefore, rayſing her ſelfe in the Litter, ſhe welcomde him very graciouſly. Then the Knight gaue her a Letter, ſpeaking thus to her. Madame, Agrais and Floreſtan, doe duteouſly commend themſelues to your acceptance; and haue expreſly ſent me to you, to bring you their mindes, contained in that writ. Wherefore, conſider with your ſelfe, if you will command me any ſeruice to them: for I muſt returne to them with all poſſible ſpeed, being well aſſured, that although I am a man of ſlender valour, yet they may ſtand in neede of my helpe, before their enterpriſe will be ended.
                  Now truſt me Sir, quoth ſhe, they may well faile of meeting with a better Knight then you are, witnes the paines you haue taken to ſpeake with me. But good Sir, ſeeing you haue done ſo much for mee, vouchſafe to let me know who you are, to the end, that I the more thankefully remember you heere-after, when better I may performe it.
                  Madame, they that know mee, ſaid he, doe tearme me Garnate of the Dreadfull Dale, whoſe griefe is not a little, for your fathers vnkindnes and cruelty to you. Notwithſtanding, hardly will he bring his purpoſe to paſſe, it will firſt coſt the liues of many good Knights, who (for your ſake) will defend you to their vttermoſt power. Ah my deare friend Garnate, quoth ſhe, I pray GOD giue mee the meanes, whereby I may acknowledge this wonderfull loyaltie. Madame, ſaid he, I haue all my life-time deſired to doe you ſome ſeruice, as one that is your moſt humble ſeruant, and now I muſt needes take my leaue of you. For he ſaw the Queene Sardamira comming neere, who beholding Oriana aduiſedly, imagined her lookes to be more chearefull, and her preſent diſpoſition much altered from the former, whereupon ſhe ſaid.
                  Madame, I doe not know the Knight that ſpake with you, but he hath handled your guards as roughly, as Floreſtan did them that had the charge of me, ſo that now they need not mocke one another. I know not, whether it be the miſfortune of the way, or through their owne want of courage: but well I wot, that I neuer ſaw two worthier knights, then this and Floreſtan.
                  
                  
                     Oriana faintly ſmyling, anſwered. I ſaw not how yours were dealt withall: but as for theſe heere, it ſeemes that they met with one, who knew well enough how to chaſtiſe their harſhneſſe. As they held on this merry mocking, Giontes, and the two other came towards them, ſo much aſhamed of themſelues, as they durſt not hold vp their heads, to looke them in the faces. But ſetting on toward Tagades, Oriana called Mabila into the Litter to her, as deſirous to haue her company. So being together, they cloſely read the Letter, whereby Floreſtan aduertiſed the Princeſſe, that Gandalin, and Ardan, the Dwarfe to Amadis, were both arriued at the Encloſed Iſle, where they exſpected their Maſter within eight dayes following, according as hee had ſent word thither; and Galuanes, Agraies, beſide many more good Knights,

were all purpoſely there met together; onely to lend her ſuccour, ſo ſoone as they ſhould haue intelligence of her ſhipping away, to bee ſent for Rome; wherefore, in the meane time, ſhe ſhould comfort her ſelfe, and be of good courage, as now ſhe had no other cauſe.
                  Theſe newes were ſo welcome to both the Ladies, as nothing elſe poſſibly could be more; and they imagined, that either they were newly reuiued from death to life, or deliuered out of a darke dungeon, into an incompatable glorious light. And all the way as they rode along, they could finde no other argument of talke, neither ſo much as thinke on any thing elſe, but only to reade and re-reade the Letter ouer and ouer, which queſtionleſſe they did an hundred times. But being come to the Court, new ſorrow ouer maſtered this iocund ſolace; fearing, leſt the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, ſhould not be able to execute their enterpriſe. Now, ſo ſoone as Oriana was alighted; ſhe went to her own lodgings, neuer going to the Queenes her Mother, according as ſhe was wont to doe, making an excuſe, that ſhe was not wel. Whereof the King receiuing knowledge, hee went to ſee her, accompanied onely with Arban, King of North wales. No ſooner was he entred the chamber: but ſhee thr

                     wning her ſelfe in teares, with a trembling voyce, thus ſhe ſpake.
                  Alas my King and Father, for Gods ſake remember your defolate daughter in compaſſion, and bee not leſſe fauourable to her, then (al your life-time) you haue beene to meane Ladies & Gentlewomen, in requiring your ayde and aſſiſtance: Ah my worthy Lord and Father, when Archalaus led you away priſoner, it was for the fame of your great goodnes, in helping her, that thereto vrged you. And can it be poſſible, that now you ſhould forget ſo rare a vertue, that euermore was moſt familiar with you? will you deale worſe with me, then euer you did with any liuing body? I haue heard that you will ſend me to the Emperor of Rome, with intent that I ſhould be his wife: But if you compell me thereto, you ſhall commit a moſt haynous ſinne; for it muſt bee done in deſpight of my ſelfe; and I am certaine, that I ſhall ſooner conſent to mine owne death. Deare Daughter, anſwered the King, think you that I reſpect not your good & honor, as I ought to doe? Father, quoth ſhe, I know not how you vnderſtand my good & honor, but this I can aſſure you, that if you ſeparate me from you, you will be an homicide to your owne blood. Then ſhe fell into ſuch ſighes and teares, as the King was enforced to forſake the Chamber, and leaue her, ſhee moned ſo much pity in him.
                  Then Arban King of Northwales ſtept to her, and hoping to comfort her, ſaid. Madame, you haue alwayes hitherto bin eſteemed wiſe, & it appeares, that now you will wander from that good reputation. Do not you know that there is due remedie for all things? It may be the King w

                     ll better aduiſe himſelfe, if you knew which way he might be won thereto. Ah my royall Couſin, anſwered ſhe, ſeeing Fortune is ſo aduerſe to me, & determines to worke her vttermoſt malice on me, depriuing you & many more of al means of ſuccouring me by force of arms, wherein you haue paſt through infinit dangers, to deliuer afflicted Ladies & Damoſels from tribulations: let me then (at leaſt) entreate you, to helpe me with your good word,

in counſelling the King from doing me ſuch ſhame, except he intends to tempt God, and conſtraine that happineſſe, (which alwayes to this inſtant hath attended on him) vtterly to forſake and abandon him, leauing (in ſteed thereof) all miſchiefe and miſery. For Gods ſake therefore, returne againe to him, and find ſome meanes to bring him hither once more, with mine olde noble Vncle Count Argamont, and Don Grumedan, to the end, that you three together may the better preuaile with him.
                  In vttering theſe words, the wofull Princeſſe was ſo grieuouſly afflicted, that ſhe ſeemed rather dead then aliue, for ſhe fell downe on the ground in a ſwoune: which King Arban ſeeing, he departed out of the Chamber, while Mabila and other Ladies (who were then about her) might miniſter ſome helpe to her in this extremity. He went to the King, and told him all that Oriana had ſaid to him: which moued him to ſuch compaſſion, as his inward diſtraction might be very eaſily diſcerned. Notwithſtanding, for all the perſwaſions he could vrge vnto him, he would not goe to her: vntill Count Argamont and olde Grumedan were ſo earneſt with him, that at laſt he yeelded. And as they entred into her Chamber, they be held her former traunce as yet to continue: wherefore he went neerer to her, and taking her in his armes, ſaid: Deare Daughter ſpeake to me; but ſhe moued neither hand nor foote, but lay as if ſhe had bin dead.
                  At length, by the helpe of Vineger and cold water, her ſpirits came to her again, & ſhe, breathing forth a vehement ſigh, able to breake a ſtrong heart in ſunder, ſeeing her Father ſo nere, ſaid vnto him. An my deare father, take pity on me. Sweet child (quoth he) what wouldſt thou haue me do? Sir, ſaid ſhe, before you ſend me away from you, I beſeech you conſider what harmes will enſue. For neuer will I ſee Rome, rather ſhall the Sea deliuer me from that hell, and ſo ſhall you be the cauſe of two euils together. Firſt, of my diſobedience to you, onely by your ſelfe enforced Next, of the diſmall homicide, which your daughter muſt and will acte vpon her ſelfe. By which meanes, in thinking to combine alliance and loue with the Emperour, (he knowing my deſtruction wrought in the meere deſpight of him: ſhe ſhall receiue iuſt occaſion of eternal hatred to you, and not he alone, but all ſuch as ſhall heare of ſo lamentable a diſaſter.

                  Daughter (quoth he) I vnderſtand you very well, your mother ſhall tell you what I am determined to do▪ therfore, do not thus diſcomfort your ſelf, but be of good cheare, and (perhaps) you ſhall haue your own deſire. The King made her this promiſe, becauſe his heart was oppreſſ
                        •
                     d with ſorrow, as he could not ſpeak any longer. And indeed,

the Queene then came in; who beholding her Daughter in ſuch wofull condition, was much amazed thereat: for Oriana no ſooner ſaw her Mother, but ſhe fell into a ſwoun againe. In which time, the King left the Chamber, committing her to the care of women, who were not a little buſie about her. After the was ſomewhat recouered, as the Queene demaunded how ſhe fared: the wofull Oriana opening her eies, which (in a manner) were quite drown'd in teares, beganne to looke vpon her very ruefully, and with a voyce meerely forced, ſaid. Alas deare Mother, my preſent eſtate is much better then it ſhould be, or I (in heart) could wiſh it: for Death now is my onely deſire, and thereto my ſpirit ſoly inclineth, ſeeing my ſelfe vtterly forſaken of the King & you. Your intent is, to ſend me to Rome, but the voyage I ſhall make, will not be halfe ſo far: becauſe I will leaue you my body (whereof you haue diſpoſed againſt all reaſon) & render my ſpirit to God, who wholly hath ſouerainge power ouer it.
                  The Queene being moued with much compaſſion, replyed thus. Sweet Daughter, the King loues you ſo dearely, as he thinkes on nothing elſe, but what may be for your good and beſt aduantage: wherefore ſhould you then thus torment your ſelfe? Why Madame Mother, anſwered Oriana, doe you think this baniſhment of mine, ſo aduantageous for me? Why doe you ſay, that the King my Father loues me, ſhewing himſelfe more mercil

                  Here you muſt vnderſtand, that during this woefull conference, betweene the Queene and her Daughter▪ the King was walking in his Garden, accompanied with very few. Count Argom

My Lord, I think my ſelfe a moſt happy man, that I can compaſſe any occaſion▪ to tell you that, which duty bindeth me to doe: knowing you a wiſe and vertuous Prince, eaſie to vnderſtand what good is got by euill meanes. Neuertheleſſe, my late commiſeration of your Princely Daughters preſent eſtate, conſtrayneth me now to remember you, of that which I heeretofore haue ſaid concerning her. And I humbly beſeech you, ſo much as a man may doe, that before you ſend her ſo farre hence; you would maturely conſider it, and iudge thereof without any partiall affection. For, as we commonly ſee, that a wiſe man ſeldome fals into any errour, when he is guided and led by reaſon: euen ſo we diſcerne the contrary, when he p

                     eſumeth ſo much vpon himſelfe, that he will allow of no counſell, but out of his owne braine, then he falles into greater dangers, then all his afterwit can recouer, as (by wofull experience) hath bin obſerued in many Princes.
                  You ſee my Lord, what extremitie your Daughter Oriana is in, and if you well conſider thereon, you may eaſilie iudge, what inconuenience may happen to her perſon, by an inward violent-conceiued deſpaire, which afterward (all your life-time) you may at leyſure repent.
                  Beyond all this, you will runne into an vnauoydable blame, not only of ſtrangers; but euen of your owne ſubiects, and thereby grow hatefull to them, whereon muſt needes enſue many miſ-fortunes.

Therefore beleeue the counſell of them, that ſolie deſire the good, benefit and honour of you and your kingdome, whereby no perill what-ſoeuer can happen to you in ſo doing: but if it ſhould fall out otherwiſe, yet you ſtand clearely excuſed, and they bound to prepare all poſſible remedies. Theſe conſiderations (my royall Maiſter) do importune my ſoule, with endleſſe imprecations, that you would vſe a fatherly pitty, and pleaſe theſe Ambaſſadors by ſome other means, then the precious price of your daughters blood. Vncle (quoth the King,) theſe words haue moued too much; therefore, if you meane to pleaſe me, vſe no more of them. So, turning from him, he eſpied the Prince Saluſte Quide, and Brandaiell enter the Garden; who being come neerer, called them to him, ſaying. Lords, my daughter is now come to court, and ſhe is ſomewhat ſickly, but I truſt ſhe will be better amended to morrow. Sir, anſwered Brandatell, we gladly would haue her deliuered to vs, ſo ſoone as may ſtand with your liking, becauſe the Emperour our Maſter, exſpects her day by day, according as he hath written to you. You know, replyed the King, that I haue conſe
                        •
                     ted to his requeſt, againſt the whole opinion of the knights of my Court, yea, and contrary to her will too. Notwithſtanding, I haue done it, in regard of the Emperors vertues; and the hope I haue, of her honorable reſpect and entertainment. In the meane while, forbeare a little, that ſhe may forget what ſhee muſt forſake, and prouide your ſhipping in a readines; for this next weeke enſuing, I will deliuer her to you fully furniſhed. My Lord, anſwered the Prince Saluſte Quide, it is not to bee wondred at, if at the firſt ſhe mou
                        •
                     ne for parting from you: but I am well aſſured, that ſo ſoone as ſhe ſhall be arriued at Rome (beholding ſo many great Lords to giue her obeyſance, the triumphes prepared to welcome her, and (aboue all) the choyce loue and reſpect of the Emperour to her) her ancient breeding will eaſily bee forgotten. Moreouer, if you pleaſe, to grace Olinda with her company, I meane to make her my wife ſo ſoone as ſhe comes there, becauſe I finde her to be a wiſe and vertuous Lady. Beleeue me (quoth the King) I wiſhe it might bee ſo: And then he entred into a large diſcourſe, of ſuch eſpeciall vertues remaining in her, as more could not be found in any Lady.
                  By this time the Tables were couered for dinner, in the midſt wherof, they that intended to combate with Grumedan, came and preſented themſelues, ſpeaking thus to King Liſuart. Sir, you know what words were vſed ſome few dayes paſt, by Lord Grumedan, to the great diſgrace of the Romanes, ſo that Prince Saluſte, and we with him, do come to challenge him the combate. Becauſe hee ſhall well know, that it ill becomes ſuch an old dotard as he is, to make compariſon with knights of Rome: therefore, if you be ſo pleaſed, it ſhall be performed tomorrow, for it grieues vs, that he ſhould remaine ſo long vnpuniſhed.
                  
                     Don Grumedan hearing himſelfe thus abuſed, beganne to change colour, and as hee was about to make anſwere, the king ſeeing him in choler, aroſe, and ſaid to him. Grumedan, you haue euermore hitherto beene wiſe and temperate, eſpecially in ſpeech: let mee then requeſt you, to conceale your diſpleaſure, and onely anſwere to the combat, which theſe Knights doe vrge you to.

Sir, ſaid Grumedan, ſeeing it is your will, it ſhall be ſo, and to morrow I will not faile to meete them in the field, according to my promiſe, where I hope to reuenge the wrong they haue done mee in your preſence.
                  So the King roſe from the Table, and went into his Chamber with Grumedan, demaunding there of him, where were they whom he had choſen to take his part? Sir, ſaid he, firſt I know the right on my ſide, and if Galaor come to morrow (as I think he will) I am well aſſured, that hee will beare me companie: but if hee come not, then will I fight with them all three, one after another. That may not be, anſwered the king, for you haue conſented to three againſt three, and ſo the oath remaines before me recorded, which makes me ſtand in great doubt of you, becauſe they are young and ſtrong, you aged and weake, and without any to helpe you. Sir, ſaid Grumedan, God who hateth pride and preſumption (wherewith they are too much enflated) can prouide helpe, when it is leaſt looked for. But if the worſt ſhould happen, I know two of mine owne kinſemen, that wil not deny to ayde me againſt them, were they far
                        •
                     e better knights then they are.
                  The King pauſing a while, ſuddenly ſaid. I haue conſidered otherwiſe for you, I will diſguiſe my ſelfe, and ſecond you in the cauſe: for, aſſure your ſelfe, you and I ſhall well hold out againſt them all three. God forbid Sir, anſwered Grumedan, that you ſhould ſo endanger your royall perſon for me. Why? ſaid the King, in better place I can neuer doe it, and neuer elſe can I iuſtly acknowledge the manifold ſeruices you haue done for me, hazarding your life in ſo many ſeuerall dangers, onely for the defence of me, and my Realme. Sir (quoth he) the preſent demonſtration of your gracious goodnes towardes me, hath ſo farre enlarged the obligation of my duty to you: that if I could dye a thouſand deathes in your ſeruice, I ſhould yet confeſſe my ſelfe more indebted to you. 
                        •
                     ut, neuer feare man, replyed the king, my heart hath yet courage enough, and this arme is endued with ſufficient ſtrength, to maintaine a quarrell of greater moment. Pardon me Sir, ſaid Grumedan, neuer will I giue conſent thereto, conſidering what wrong you ſhall doe to your ſelfe, you being a king of vpright iuſtice, ſhould deale as truely with a ſtranger, as him that is your familiar friend. Well (quoth the King) ſeeing you are ſo earneſt, I will vrge it no further, although it goes much againſt my minde: goe then, and prouide for your buſines; for you haue no time now of trif
                        •
                     ing delaying.
                  
                     Grumedan gaue him the good night, and went to his owne lodging, whether he ſent for two knights his kinſmen, ſpeaking thus to them. You know the Combate, which I haue vndertaken to morrow againſt three Romanes, and becauſe you are they in whom I haue moſt confidence: I would make choiſe of no other Knights then you, to ſecond me in ſo good an action. They accepted this offer very ioyfully, and reputed themſelues highly honoured thereby: ſo they departed to make ready their Armes; and Grumedan entred into a Chappel, where hee remained in prayer till the next morning, and then went to make all things fit for him.
                  As he began to arme himſelf, the Damoſell belonging to Graſinda, (of whom you haue formerly heard)

ſuddenly came thither, bearing one of the goodlieſt Swords that euer was ſeene; and ſaluting Grumedan, ſpake thus. Sir, the Greek knight, who dearely loues and reſpects you, for the manly ſpirit alwayes knowen to be in you, hath ſent you this Sword, which he frankely giues you, as being one of the beſt knights in the world: and it is the very ſame, wherewith (not long ſince) he chaſtiſed the Romaines in your preſence.
                  By me he tels you further, that he hath heard of your vrgent neceſſity, for two Knights to aſſiſt you in this fight: wherefore, he hath left two of his own aſſociats, whom he reputes no way inferiour to himſelfe, and prayes you (for his ſake) to make vſe of them, and not to imploy any other in this buſines. Faire Damoſell, (quoth he) I humbly thanke both the Knight, and you, for the great pains you haue taken to bring me theſe tydings, which are not a little welcome to me.
                  So receiuing the Sword, it ſeemed to him one of the beſt that euer he had ſeene; and guirding it on his thigh, he ſaid to the Damoſell. Truely, the Greek knight hath done much for me, conſidering the ſmall knowledge we haue together; and God giue mee grace, that I may make amends for this fauor one way or other. His two friendly companions (quoth ſhe) do attend you, and are ready to enter Combate ſo ſoone as you ſhall pleaſe: therefore ſlacke you no time, for I ſaw the three Romaines as I came hether, in good forwardnes to their owne diſhonor. Then the horſe was brought, which Floreſtan had giuen him, the very ſame which hee conquered before the Queene Sardamira: and being mounted thereon, he rode ſoftly to the place where the Combate ſhould be performed. There hee found the two knights, that were come to helpe him; and they ſaluting one another, Grumedan ſaid vnto them. Gentlemen, I know not who you are, but that which you come to doe for me, giueth apparant teſtimony, that all my life-time I muſt acknowledge you for my deareſt friends.
                  As he ended theſe wordes, they ſaw the three Romaines enter the field, with Trumpets and Clarions ſounding before them, and making ſuch a noyſe in the ayre, as it ecchoed round about in euery place. Inſtantly was the King mounted on his Scaffold, who caſting his eye euery-where, as exſpecting Grumedan, hee ſaw him betweene the two knights and the Damoſell, whom he knew ſo ſoone as he beheld her. But he could not deuiſe, who they were that tooke part with Grumedan: wherefore he called to the Damoſell, and demaunded of her, if ſhe had brought them. Sir, ſaid ſhee, the good are euermore ſupported by ſuch as themſelues are, and that is the reaſon, why the Greek knight, vnderſtanding the loyaltie of Lord Grumedan, and the Combate he had vndertaken againſt the Romaines; alſo, what ſlender meanes he had of helpe at this preſent, all the beſt knights being now abſent from your Court: Hee hath therefore ſent two of his owne companions, whom you may eſteeme little inferiour to himſelfe, in all thoſe good parts belonging to manhood. And thus Sir, you may alſo aſſure your ſelfe, that Grumedan neuer exſpected any ſupply: for he neuer knew thereof, till ſuch time as he was ready to mount on horſeback, and that I my ſelfe preſented them to him. Truſt mee Damoſell, anſwered the King, the Greeke knight hath done

much for him, eſpecially, in ſuch a neceſſity.
                  Scarcely were theſe wordes ended, but the three Romaines came before the Kings Scaffold, ſpeaking to him (ſo loude as all might heare them) in this manner. Sir, in regard that we haue reſolued with our ſelues, to carry the heades of three Knights to Rome, that dare preſume to combate with vs. We humbly deſire, that you will not bee diſpleaſed therewith, although Don Grumedans head be one of them, which yet you may helpe, by ſending word to him, that if hee will deny his former words heere before your Maieſty, and freely confeſſe, that we Romaines are the beſt knights in the world, we are contented to forgiue all. Doe (quoth the King) that which you come to doe, and hee that remaineth conquerour, let him deale with his enemie as beſt pleaſeth himſelfe.
                  By this time, the Queene and her Ladies had taken their ſeates, accompanied with Guillan le Penſif, and Cendill de Ganote, both yet ſo weake, by reaſon of their ſickneſſe, as they could hardly ſupport them-ſelues: For Guillan was newlie deliuered from a continuall Feuer, and Ganote had both his legges ſhotte through with an arrow, as the King was hunting in the Forreſt. Now, the Queen much miſ-doubted, that Fortune would deale frowardly with the good old Grumedan, and therefore calling Guillan to her, demaunded his opinion in this caſe. Madame (quoth he) the hazards of fights, are euermore in the will of heauen, and the good right of the Combatants: but not in the armes ſtrength, nor in the preſumption of men.
                  Wherfore Madame, we all knowing Grumedan to be wiſe, a vertuous Knight, and as honeſt a man as the world can yeeld (far differing from the ouer-weining pride, of thoſe men that he hath to deale withall:) it makes me verily think, that (weak as I am) if I were in his place, I ſhould eaſily winne the honour of the day. This anſwere did highly content the Queene, yea, and in ſuch ſort, that ſhe conceiued better hope of Grumedans victory, then formerly ſhe had done.
                  Now, the Knights on eyther ſide, encountred together ſo furiouſly, as their Launces flew vp in many ſhiuers: but there befell ſuch an accident, as neuer happened in King Liſuarts Court before, for the three Romanes were all vnhorſed, and none of the other loſt ſo much as a ſtirrop, wherefore, turning their faces readily, they ſaw them lye on a heape together.
                  Hereupon Bruneo de bonne Mer, one of them which the Damoſell brought to helpe Grumedan, ſaid to him. Seeing wee haue let the Romanes perceiue, that we know how to breake our Launces, it were very vnreaſonable, that we ſhould aſſaile them any longer on horſebacke; for they being downe, let vs deſcend alſo. Be it as you pleaſe, anſwered Grumedan, and diſmounting from their horſes, being couered with their Shields, manly they marched againſt the Romanes, to whom Angriote ſpake ſo loud as hee could, thus.
                  Beleeue me, Gentlemen of Rome, I thinke you make little, or no account at all of vs, or elſe, being willing to beſtow your horſes on vs, you are content to diſmount ſo readily, as (for your 
                        ••
                     kes) we will doe the like.
                  The Romanes, whoſe hearts (before) were ſo highly aduanced, as none could reache a loftier pitch.

finding their proud hopes to bee thus fruſtrated, were ſo confounded with ſhame, as they would not anſwere ſo much as a word, but holding downe their heads, ranne vpon their enemies with ſuch ſwiftnes, as eaſily might their inward malice be diſcerned.
                  But if they ſhewed themſelues rough and ſharpe aſſayling, the other were not negligent in defending, eſpecially Grumedan, who in his earneſt deſire to be reuenged, entred among them, laying blowes hardly to be endured, wounding others, and receiuing ſome himſelfe. Notwithſtanding, in the end, he and his two companions (laying aſide all care of perill) layde ſuch heauy loade vpon the other, that they were compelled to recoyle, and Maganil fell downe backward. Then Brunco de bonne Mer, who ſharply purſued him, ſtept vpon him, and violently plucking the helmet from his head, threw him againſt the Scaffold, whereon the Queene and Ladies ſate. Where Maganil, ſeeing him ſelfe in danger of death, cryed out for pitty and compaſſion: but Bruneo, pretending not to heare him, bade him yeeld himſelfe, or elſe hee would ſmite off his head. Sir (quoth he) I will doe whatſoeuer you commaund me, and heere I am ready to confeſſe, that I haue lied falſely: for the Romane Knights are not ſuch as I haue boaſted them to be nor any way comparable to them of Great Brittaine.
                  
                  This acknowledgement was heard by the Queene, and Guillan, who pittying him that ſo earneſtly ſued for pardon, ſaide to Brunco. Worthy Grecian Knight, mee thinkes you ſhould haue little deſire to that head, which is full of nothing elſe but pride and vain-glory: wherefore, leaue it to himſelfe, as a matter of no value, to the end, that when he is returned to Rome, hee may there make report, what benefit he got heere by his inſolence and preſumption; the Queene and her Ladies ioyne with me in this ſuite to you.
                  Since ſo vertuous a Princeſſe, anſwered he, doth command me, and you (whom as yet I know not) doe alſo deſire it, farre be it from mee to deny it. So taking his foote off from Maganil, he returned to Grumedan, who had beaten downe the ſecond, and he likewiſe fearing the loſſe of his head, made the like amends as his fellow did.
                  Now there remained none but the third, who had loſt ſo much blood, that he fell downe dead at the feete of Angriote: wherefore he tooke him by one legge, and dragde him out of the field. In which while, Grumedan remounted on horſebacke, and imaging that his two new friends would follow him, with-drew thence to his owne lodging, that his wounds might be looked vnto.
                  But ſo ſoone as he was gone, Bruneo and Angriote, without putting off their Helmets, as fearing to bee knowen, preſented themſelues before the King, and ſaid vnto him. Sir, we muſt now take our leaue of you, and returne to our worthy friend the Greeke Knight, with whom we are ſo much honored and eſteemed, as in no place elſe we can deuiſe to finde the like. Wherefore, if you pleaſe to commaund vs any ſeruice to him, we are ready to doe it with moſt willing mindes. God be your guide, anſwered the King; for certainly, both he and you haue made it ſufficiently knowen, that you are no new learners to deale in ſuch combates.
                  Then the Damoſell, who had bin

their conduct thither, ſaide to the king, that ſhee deſired to ſpeake in priuate with him, concerning a matter much importing him. That ſhall you faire Damoſell, ſaid he. So, all being commanded thence, ſhe aſcended the Scaffold, to afford Bruneo and Angriote the better meanes of departure, 
                        ••
                     turning the ſame way, as they came; and ſhe being come to the King, beganne thus. Sir, quoth ſhe, you haue hitherto bin held for the moſt eſteemed King of Chriſten

More I may not ſay to you, becauſe I am to follow the two knights, who (I feare) haue long ere this exſpected mee. Damoſel, ſaid the King, heauen bee your conducter, you haue ſpoke very wiſely, and like a woman of good ſpirit.
                  So the Damoſell deſcended, and departed, and arriuing where the two knights were, they rode on to the Sea, finding a Brigandine there attending, which Graſinda had appointed for them. And becauſe they knew for certainty, that king Liſuart had ſet downe his determination, to deliuer his Daughter the firſt day of the weeke enſuing, they made what haſte poſſibly they could to be with the Greek knight, that he might alſo bee acquainted there-with.
                  And they ſtayed not aboue two dayes and two nights. but they took hauen in the Encloſed Iſle, where the other were landed but a little before. Whereof Agraies, Ploreſtan, and others, being aduertiſed, they went to meete them with no meane ioy. There might you haue ſeene mutuall loue and am
                        •…
                      on all ſides, congratulations, embraces, and all the ceremonious offices of courteſie, all done in honour of Lord Amadis: whereat Graſinda being amazed, knew not what to ſay, vntill hee came vnto her, ſaying,
                  Madame, I pray you bee no way diſcontented, that thus long I haue concealed my name from you, which is Amadis de Gaule, of whom your ſelfe haue often ſpoken. Theſe

other are my kinred and companions, friends and followers, all reſolued to doe you any ſeruice what-ſoeuer.
                  Lord Amadis, anſwered ſhe, you need not deſire any pardon of me, conſidering, you haue neuer offended me: but rather I am highly to be condemned, that haue had you ſo long time in my houſe, not like a great Prince and Lord, as you are, but rather in the nature of a meane Knight errant.
                  And you had reaſon to conceale your ſelfe from me; for if I had ſo well knowen you then, as now I do: I ſhould haue ſtrouen with my beſt endeauour, to doe ſuch honour, as you iuſtly deſerue. Sweete Madame, ſaid he, neuer vſe ſuch words, in regard you haue done ſo much for me, as I remaine obliged vnto you while I liue.
                  Walking on in this conference, they entred into the Palace of Apolidon, where they found the Tables couered for dinner, and the meate already ſerued in: Scarcely were they ſet downe, but Angriote, Bruneo and the Damoſell came in before them, where we need make no doubt of their hearty welcome. And as Amadis had queſtioned them, what iſſue Grumedans Combate had againſt the Romanes: they related to him, that the King was fully minded, to deliuer his Daughter to the Emper ours Ambaſſadours, and that within three or foure dayes at the vttermoſt.
                  Heereat Amadis was ſo moued, that his colour preſently chaunged, as being doubtfull, that either they ſhould not haue time enough for her reſcue, or that they of the Encloſed Iſle, would not partake with him in ſuch an enterpriſe againſt King Liſuart. Therefore to feele how they ſtood affected to his purpoſe, ſo ſoone as the dinner was ended, falling into much variety of diſcourſe, and growing into ſome reportarie of his long voyage, at laſt thus he beganne with them.
                  My worthy and honourable friendes, for ought I can perceiue, matters are much altred in Great Brittaine, ſince we haue bin out of it, and the King hath got him another kinde of humour, then he was wont to haue in precedent times. For I haue ſeene and knowen, that he would readily more regard the affaires of poore diſtreſſed Ladies, then matters of moſt moment concerning himſelfe. Notwithſtanding, to my no little amazement, he is bent to the deſtruction of his own naturall daughter, that peereleſſe Princeſſe, Madame Oriana, then whom, neuer was childe more diligent and reſpectiue of her parents, then from time to time ſhe hath alwayes declared her ſelfe. And yet, as Angriote and Bruneo doe plainly tell me, without regard of all this duty and obedience, euen in the meere deſpight of her, and contrary to the iudgement of all the Lords of Great Brittaine, he hath relegated and confined her, to the onely man in the world, whom ſhe moſt hateth; which moueth me ſo much to commiſerate her caſe, as, if you would both beleeue me, and lend me your aſſiſtance, we would free her from this thraldome, and ſet her at libertie.
                  Sighing and pauſing a while, hee began againe in this maner. What-ſoeuer I haue ſaid (my deare-eſteemed kinſmen and friends,) aſſure your ſelues, that I will not vndertake any thing, without your counſell and furtherance. And yet wee ſhould all remember the ſolemne oath we made to the Queene Briſena,
                     
at the very laſt Court held in the City of London: where wee then ſware, neuer to ſuffer wrong to be done to any Lady or Damoſell, if ſhe required helpe of vs. Shall we now then endure, that ſhe ſhall be captined, and vyllie entreated, of whom (heeretofore) we haue receiued ſo many honorable fauours? Shall the Ladies and Virgins of her company, be carried away perforce, and (for euer) baniſhed from their owne country? Before God, I ſpeake it, if we doe ſuffer this haynous indignity, we are well worthy of eternall blame, without any excuſe or pretence to ſhield vs: nay, we ſhall fall into the baſe reputation, of recreant and vnworthy knights, regardleſſe both of honour and Armes.
                  Let vs then aduiſe here together, what you think meeteſt to be done. For, as concerning my ſelfe, I determine to deferre a voyage, long ſince by me intended: as, not many dayes ſince, I made knowen to my Couſin Agraies, Floreſtan, and others, by Gandalin, and now with ſuch Ships as I ſhould finde heere, labour ſo much as lies in me, to breake the purpoſe of King Liſuart, and reſcue ſo many wronged Ladies. Among whom, next to the moſt wofull Princeſſe Oriana, is vertuous Olinda, whom the King (in this new-deuiſed tyranny) will compell to marry Saluſte Quide, albeit vtterly againſt his owne liking.
                  And now Lords, let me mooue one matter to you: I would gladly know, by what autority he can warrant this crueltie, to them that are none of his ſubiects, neither borne within any of his Dominions? There is my Couſin Mabila, ſent by the King her father into Great Brittaine, not to be confined for Rome, but to remaine with the Queene, and keep the Princeſſe Oriana company, to whom her loue hath alwayes bin ſuch, as neuer could bed greater betweene two Princeſſes. And I much maruall, that his whole kingdome doth not reuolt againſt him, or (at leaſt) ſome bold and hardy Knight vnder-take the cauſe, to counter check his folly honorably by Armes.
                  We ſee (deare friends) that no one (as yet) ſteppes forth in the action; and therefore I would entreate you, that, according to the ancient commendable cuſtome, diligently obſerued among alknights errant: you would be carefull, that ſuch a ſhamefull and diſhonourable deed may not be done. In ſo doing, we ſhall winne more fame and true renowne, then euer hitherto we haue done, without any euill imputation, or ſiniſter miſconſtruction. Tell me then, what you thinke here-of, to the end, that according to ſome reſolued concluſion, we may take order for the moſt expedient execution.
                  Then Agraies, whom it neereſt concerned, as well for his Siſter, as for the honorable affection he bare to Olinda, as hath bin declared to you in the firſt booke: anſwered before them all, in this manner. I know not where the man is, that would be dull or ſlow in ſo acceptable an enterpriſe; conſidering, that before you (my Lord and Couſin) arriued here: we were all aſſembled in this place, to make prouiſion for this in conuenience. And now, that you finde vs ſo conformable to your will, I am certaine, that no man among vs, is of any other minde; but that Fortune meerely calles vs, to vndertake the buſineſſe, and promiſes vs an vndoubted victory. For ſhe ſeemeth weary, that ſhe hath fauoured King Liſuart ſo

long a time, and he makes no acknowledgment thereof any manner of way. Why ſhould hee ſend my Siſter (againſt her wil) into a ſtrange countrie? Did my Father giue her him, to diſpoſe of at his pleaſure? You all know, that ſoone after our departure from Great Brittaine, I demanded her of the Queene: but ſhe denyed me, ſending me word by Gandales, that ſhe would keepe and reſpect her as her owne perſon. Is this then kindſhip, or courteſie, to keepe her in ſuch ſort, as to ouer-throw all her fortunes in the end? Mabila, hath ſhe no other place of retirement, but to the Court of the Emperour? Is not the kingdome of SCOTLAND of ſufficient opulencie, for her breeding and education?
                  Striking his hand on his breſt, with a very ſmall pauſe, he brake forth againe thus. I proteſt before God, this dealing of King Liſuart, is both vile and diſhonourable; yea, and ſo farre off from common reaſon, that I had rather die a thouſand deathes (if it were poſſible for me) then not to be reuenged; and already I haue acquainted the King my Father herewith, that he may prouide ſome remedie for it. In the meane while, let me entreate you al, my honorable Lords and friends, to lend me your aſſiſtance, eſpecially you, whom this iniurie toucheth as neerely as my ſelfe, it being offered, not only to the perſon of my Siſter, your Couſin and neere kinred: but alſo to Olinda & others, for whom, according to our ſolemne oath and promiſe (as my Lord Amadis hath well remembred) wee ought in duty to ſteppe forth, and ſtand as their protectors and defenders.
                  Lords, ſaid Quedragant, as for my ſelfe, I am ready to depart, when it ſhall pleaſe the company, and if I make any ſpare of my paines, let me be excluded from all good opinion: and I beleeue there is no man heere among vs, but he will ſay as much as I haue done. For, if wee hazard our liues often, and vpon little or ſleight occaſion: we haue great reaſon now to aduenture further, and not to be ſparing of our very vttermoſt endeauour. How ſay ye, my friends, haue I not ſpoken the trueth?
                  Then euery one anſwered, that no danger, or death ſhould cauſe any deferring, but it required quicke and ſpeedy diligence, to keepe the Romanes, from paſſing through the ſtraites of the Mediterranean Sea, before any fight were made vpon them. Eaſily, quoth Amadis, ſhal we make this prouiſion, for to morrow morning wee will be all well ſhipt, and winne the way before them; which was ſet downe for a full reſolue.
                  Now Graſinda was preſent at all this conference; and ſhe to giue them the more encouragement, ſaid. Before God, Gentlemen, your enterpriſe is high, and worthy of the greateſt commendation, conſidering, that beſide the good you ſhall doe to her, whoſe helpe and reſcue you intend, you ſhal giue example to many other worthy Knights (either of this, or any other ſtrange Country) that heereafter by your imitation) they ſuffer no ſhame or wrong to be done, to any Lady or Gentlewoman whatſoeuer. Wherein you will make your ſelues ſo memoratiue to them, that ſhe, or they that now liue, or ſhal many hundreds of yeares hereafter, will ſing rare Peans of your praiſes.
                  Madame, anſwered Amadis, God enable vs to effect our enterpriſe, according as (I know) you heartily

wiſh it. In the meane while, if you be ſo pleaſed, you ſhal remain here, in the company of Yſanie, the good old Gouernour of this Iſland, who ſhall be as obedient to you, as to my ſelfe. Maiſter Eliſabet muſt go with me, becauſe I repoſe great truſt in him. My Lord (quoth ſhe) you may diſpoſe of me and mine, according as to you ſeemeth beſt. Amadis humbly thanked her, and gaue command, that euery man ſhould bee prepared, to go aboord thoſe Ships, by breake of day, which Agraies and Floreſtan had there readily furniſhed, according as they had order ſent them by Gandalin. Then, the next day, being all embarqued, they ſet ſaile directly for Great Brittaine, hoping to meet with the Romans, as afterward they did.
               
               
                  CHAP. XVIII.
                  
                     How King Liſuart deliuered his Daughter Oriana, to the Ambaſſadors of the Emperour, and other Ladies with her, to be conueyed to Rome: And how they were (ſoone after) reſcued by the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle.
                     
                  
                  
                     THe day being come, according to King Liſuarts promiſe, that he would deliuer his Daughter to the Romanes, to be conducted to the Emperour, hee continuing conſtant in his wilful opinion, without any poſſibility of alteration, either of pitty to her, importunity vſed by the Queene, and all the graue aduice of his Lords to the contrary. To effect the full iſſue of his owne humour, he went to her Chamber, where ſitting downe by her, and taking her by the hand, thus he ſpake. Daughter, you haue euermore ſhewen your ſelfe obedient to my will, neuer vſing any contradiction: will you now hold on in the ſame mind, according as Reaſon doth require? You haue put on a ſad and melancholy diſpoſition, at the marriage which I haue determin'd for you, whereat I am not a little amazed. Do you imagine, that I would doe any thing, but for your benefite and honor? or can you conceipt any euill in clination in me towards you? I ſweare to you vpon my faith, that the loue I beare you is ſo certaine, as I do no leſſe grieue for your farre abſence from me, then you can doe your ſelfe. But you doe well know, that it is impoſſible, to prouide ſuch an happines for you neerer home. Wherefore I pray you, that in vſing your wonted wiſdome and diſcretion, you would ſhew a more chearefull countenance, & reioyce in the great fortune ordained for you, being wife to the greateſt Prince in the world. If you doe, (beſides the high eſtimation generally to be made of you) you ſhall glad your fathers ſoule, who grieues at your ſtrange alteration, as no man poſſibly can doe more.
                  During all theſe ſpeeches, Oriana had her ſpirits ſo contracted, that ſhe was not able to ſhed a teare; and therefore, as a woman, out of ſenſe of her own ſorrow, ſeeing there was now no further remedy for her, with a bolde and ſtedfaſt reſolution, thus ſhee replied. My Lord, you haue then (for ought I can otherwiſe perceiue) reſolued on my mariage

to the Emperor: but therein (happily) you haue committed one of the greateſt errors, that any Prince aliue can doe. For firſt, ſo long as my life laſteth, I ſhall neuer loue the husband you haue choſen for mee; and next, I am very certaine, (as oftentimes I haue told you already) that I ſhall neuer ſee Rome: rather ſhall the fiſhes vſe their mercy to me, then I will goe to a home that is my hell, or dwel where I can haue no affection or deſire. And I am of the minde, that you could not be heereto induced or perſwaded, but onely in the loue you beare to my Siſter, being deſirous to leaue your inheritance to her, and make mee heire to all the miſeries in the world. Neuertheleſſe, God, who is iuſt, will neuer ſuffer this your vnreaſonable purpoſe to take effect; ſooner he will marry mee to my death.
                  When the King heard Oriana anſwere in this manner, pitty and anger mixing themſelues together, made him likewiſe change his former language, and thinking to win her by menaces, ſaid. You play the foole with me, and you will not yeeld, for all the entreaties I can make: but if you dallie thus with me any longer, inſteed of wiuing you to the Emperour, I will wed you to the Tower, and where you ſhall ſee neither Sunne nor Moone. My Lord, quoth ſhe, you can not commit me to a more hatefull priſon, then Rome, and you ſhall doe me a great grace, to make me an euerlaſting dweller in your Tower. Then aroſe the King, very highly diſpleaſed, and leauing her, went to the Queene, ſaying to her. I pray you go to your daughter; for, notwithſtanding all the meanes I can vſe to her, ſhe will not be ſent to the Emperour, and I cannot reuoke my promiſe to the Ambaſſadours.
                  Now, you muſt obſerue, that the Queene had practiſed all poſſible wayes, to breake off this intended mariage, till ſuch time, as at her laſt mouing the matter, the King grew ſo offended, that he charged her to motion it no more, except ſhee meant to endure his heauy diſpleaſure. Wherefore, as not daring to incenſe him any further, without returning him any anſwer, ſhe went to Oriana, whom ſhe found ſo full of ſorrow, as none could be more. Oriana, leaned on her left arme, beating her other hand againſt her breſt; when the Queen ſaid to her. Daughter, the king is wonderfully offended with you: I pray you be obedient to him, ſeeing all that he doth, is for your good and honor. Ah Mother, (quoth ſhe) I ſee now that I am loſt for euer; for I feel death ſo nere approching, as it is impoſſible for me to liue any longer. Speaking theſe words, ſhe fell down in a ſwoun, and the Queene likewiſe hard by her, which made the Ladies cry out ſo loud, that the King heard it, & came thither, imagining that Oriana was dead indeed. But finding it no otherwiſe then a traunce, he would needs haue her caried ſo aboard the Ship, notwithſtanding all the Ladies teares, & mourneful entreaties.
                  Being thus brought into the Cabine appointed for her, the Ladies were likewiſe ledde thither, that ſhould go with her, among whom was Olinda, ſtrugling and ſtriuing with all her might, & crying to the King, that ſhe might not be ſo violently forced and abuſed. Notwithſtanding, he would not lend her any attention, but ſuffered her ſo to be hurried thence, ſo great was his diſtraction of ſpirit. Before they weighed ankers, he called to the Prince Saluſte Quide, and other the

choiſeſt of the Ambaſſadours, to whom he recommended his daughter: praying them to entreate her in all honourable manner. Which they promiſed to doe; and taking a ſolemne farewell each of other, the King returned to his Court, and the Romanes launching forth into the Maine, ſoone loſt the Coaſte of Tagades, Oriana not knowing or perceiuing any thing, ſuch was her rapture quite from her ſelfe.
                  The Ambaſſadours to the Emperor, had bequeathed Mabila onely, to keepe company with her in her Cabine; and the Queene Sardamira, with the reſt of the women, were beſtowed in another Shippe, and ſo (in no litle ioy) ſayle on the Romanes, till at length they deſcryed on the Sea, a great Fleete of Shippes, making directly towards them.
                  But, at the firſt ſight, taking them to be either Merchants, or ſome ſuch other peaceable people, they made no further reckoning of them. By and by they beheld them to diuide into three ſeuerall bands, and make faſt on them, by the helpe of oares: which gaue them good cauſe to prepare for defence, if they ſhould aſſaile them. But I am ſure you perceiue, that this was the ſuccour for Oriana, led by noble Amadis, and a great number of worthy Knights, as well of the Encloſed Iſle, as diuers other of his friends thus met together, all determining to dye, rather then to permit the Ladies to be thus forcibly carried away.
                  When they perceiued ſo many ſailes together, and in ſuch martiall manner prepared, eſpecially for ſo great a conuoy, there grew a iealous doubt among ſome of them; which Amadis perceiuing, and fearing, leſt their ſuſpition might diſharten the reſt, he ſpake to them in this manner. My honorable friends and companions, were I not fully aſſured of the vertue and magnanimity remaining in you, I ſhould (doubtleſſe) be ſlow enough, in hazarding the fight againſt the enemie, that comes ſo ſtrongly prepared for vs. Neuertheles, knowing you to be ſuch as you are, and alwayes haue beene; eſpecially, the iuſt occaſion that hath called vs all hether: it appeareth to me, that we ſhould not inſiſt on the leaſt delay, but, ſetting aſide all ſeruile feare, goe couragiouſly to the buſines. The captiuity of ſo many deſolate Ladies, ſtand as inciting obiects to our eyes, and honour calles vs to their reſcue, by our ſolemne oathes taken for their freedome. Wherefore, I earneſtly entreate you, that we may brauely boord their Ships, and make ſuch expreſſion of our duty, that ſetting the Ladies at libertie, the conductors of them may carry no tydings to the Emperour.
                  No ſooner were theſe wordes thus ſpoken, but Drummes and Trumpets ſounded chearefully: for the two Fleetes were ſo neere each to other, as there could be no ſhrinking backe from fight. Now, Darts, Slings, Arrowes, wilde fire balles, and other offenſiue engines, flew liberally 
                        •••
                     oad; and the fight (in the beginn
                        •…
                     ) was ſo fierce, as no iudgment could be giuen, which ſide had the better or worſe. Notwithſtanding, they of the Encloſed Iſle, (by the meanes of that exquiſite Pilot, Maſter Eliſabet) got before the winde, and ſunke two or three of the Shippes of the enemie. At the very ſame inſtant, the Ship wherein Agrates and Quedragant were, by the meanes of grapling yrons, caught hold on that of the

Prince Saluſte Quide, and the men entred into her. But if Agraies and Quedragant made ample proofe of their manhood: Floreſtan, and Garnate of the Dreadfull Dale did no leſſe, hauing boarded another Ship hard by. For they aſſailed the Marqueſſe of Ancona, and the Archbiſhop of Tarente, while Amadis fought with the Ship wherein Brandaiell was; whereto hee had moſt minde, becauſe it ſeemed the beſt diſpoſed, and had a goodly Lanterne, with great ſtore of Flags and Streamers, bearing the armes of the Emperour, euen as Admirall of the whole Fleet, which made him imagine, that the Princeſſe was there.
                  Great and ſtout reſiſtance was a long while made, but Amadis and his followers plyed them ſo hotly, that they cut ſo many in pieces, as they met withall, crying out aloud, Amadis, Amadis, Gaule, Gaule. As he purſued on in this good ſucceſſe, he met with Brandaiell, to whom hee gaue ſuch a ſtroke on the helmet, as he ouerthrew him; and tearing it from his head, made ſhew, as if he would ſmite it off. Alas Sir (cryed out Brandaiel) take ſuch ranſome of me as you pleaſe, and ſaue my life.
                  Tell me then, ſaid Amadis, what haſt thou done with Oriana? You ſhall finde her (quoth 
                        〈◊〉
                      in this Cabine, accompanied 
                        •…
                     ly with Mabila. As he was going thither, Angriote ſtept in, to whom he gaue the charge of his priſoner, and going neere the doore, he found it ſtrongly barde with an iron chaine: but running with his foot againſt it, he made it violently flye open.
                  
                     Mabila being in the Cabine with the Princeſſe, had formerly heard the voyce of Amadis, and Gaule, and ſaid to Oriana, being laide (much trobled in mind) vpon a rich Couch, and had heard nothing al this while of the fight: Madame, beleeue, that heauen hath ſent vs helpe; for me thinkes I heare your Amadis, enquiring for you, therefore raiſe vp your ſpirits, and reioyce. At the very word Amadis, the Princeſſe ſeemed to riſe (as with a ſudden ſtart) demaunding, where is Amadis?
                  
                  Madame, quoth ſhe, I heard him (I am certaine) euen now both ſpeake and fight in the ſame Shippe where we now are. Doe not you yet heare the noyſe among the other Shippes? Vndoubtedly, the fight is hot and fierce. Come, come, deare Mabila, anſwered Oriana, queſtionleſſe you are in a dreame. No, vpon my ſoule, replyed Mabila, I heard the ſlaſhes of Swordes, and the noyſe of a very potent Fleete.
                  At this very word, Amadis entred, and ſeeing Oriana, he fell on his knee before her. But ſhe (ouer-come with extremitie of ioy) held him by the arme, and glewed her lippes ſo faſt to his, as if ſhe meant they ſhould neuer be parted, and thus ſhe ſtood a long while, robde of all power for ſpeech, till at length ſhe ſaid. Ah my deareſt Loue, ſeeing I am now in your cuſtody, I feare not them that would take me from you, or going any further with them, for Death it ſelfe ſhall now neuer more diuide vs. Madame, ſaid he, one of the greateſt fauours that euer heauen affoorded me, is this, in giuing me ſo good an occaſion of returne into this country, onely to doe ſuch needfull ſeruice.
                  As they meant to continue longer this kinde of diſcourſe, Mabila ſaid vnto them. Why ſtand you muſing in this manner? Doe you

not ſee Sir, what need there is of your helpe in yonder other Ships, where the fight is fiercer and fiercer? Good Couſin, goe and ſuccour your deare friendes, you may afterward conuerſe at more leyſure with the Princeſſe. Goe then, deare hart, ſaid Oriana, and returne againe ſo ſoone as you can to me. Then he departed out of the Cabin, leauing Oriana and Mabila to the charge of Angriote, and entring his owne Ship, beheld Landin de Faiarque, and his aſſociats, aſſayled by a Romane Veſſell, that preſſed very furiouſly vpon them. But hee made in with ſuch a ſtrength, as they were ſoone ſunke: And now remained no more to bee fought withall, but that Ship wherein the Prince Saluſte Quide was, which reſiſted ſtoutly againſt Agraies and Quedragant. Neuertheleſſe, at the arriuall of Amadis the Prince by no meanes could auoyde, but that he was ſmitten downe vpon the Orelope.
                  
                     Agraies, who hated him to the death, becauſe he caried away his beloued Olinda forcibly; caught the Helmet from off his head, and (at one blow) parted it from his body. Now, the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, ſeeing Fortune had bin ſo fauourable to them, placed guardes vpon the conquered Ships, while Amadis, went to enquire for the Queene Sardamira, and the other Ladies (whom he found in the Ship, where the Prince Saluſt Quide lay ſlaine) quaking like leaues vpon a tree.
                  When Olinda eſpied Agraies, ſhe (more ioyfull then euer) ranne and embraced him, before he had a ſight of her: but afterward, ouercome with the ſame extremity of delight, making a low reuerence to her, he ſaid. Madame, I pray you pardon what I haue done to the Prince Saluſte Quide, who in ſeeking to make you his wife and miſtreſſe, hath receiued the reward of his preſumption by my Sword.
                  Sir, quoth ſhe, I know not what might mooue him to affect me ſo much, conſidering, I neuer ſhewed leſſe loue to any man liuing: therefore, what he ſought to compaſſe by extremity, hath returned vpon him condigne puniſhment, and now I neede mourne the leſſe for a whole yeare. But I pray you tell me, how you happened to ſuccour vs in ſuch a need? Madame, ſaid he, that muſt be related at more leyſure, when all this tumult is blowen ouer.
                  While Agraies and Olinda were thus in talke together, Amadis conferred with the Queene Sardamira, (who knew not him) and comforted her, deſiring her, not to be grieued, for the diſaſter happening to her company: but ſhee wept ſo extreamely, as that it would haue moued any heart to pitty, which made him leaue her, and goe to the Damoſell of Denmarke.
                  
                  Then the Queene demaunded of Floreſtan, what he was that had ſpoken to her? Madame, quoth he, it is Lord Amadis, that worthy Knight. Nay then, ſaid ſhe, I am of better comfort then euer, and cannot faile of good entertainment in his company: for all my life time I haue heard, that all Ladies and Damoſels receiued from him nothing but honor.
                  
                     Amadis ouer-hearing her, left the Damoſell of Denmarke, and returning to her againe, ſaid. Madame, you may thinke your ſelfe as ſafe, and welcome into this company, as when you were with the Prince Saluſte Quide; and therefore bee no longer diſconſolate. Lord Amadis,
                     
anſwered ſhee, I haue heard euery where reported, what honorable fauours you haue extended to women, which giueth mee ſome perſwaſion, that you will deale with me no worſſe, but better if you can. And reaſon good, Madame, ſaid he, for you being a Queene, deſerue to haue the very beſt entertainement. And as for my ſelfe, I promiſe you on my faith, that I will endeuour what I can for you: and to begin my word with you, if you be ſo pleaſed, I will conduct you to Madame Oriana, to the end, that you being both together, may enioy conſolation one with another, equall to your owne contentments and liking.
                  Then Amadis commanding the two Ships to be vnited together, and entring into that where the Princeſſe was, leading the Queene Sardamira by the hand, he preſented her to Oriana, ſaying. Madam, here is the Queene Sardamira, and all the Ladies and Gentlewomen that ſhould attend you, who deſire, that you would accept of their company. Amadis (quoth ſhe) I am your priſoner, and therefore you may and muſt command me, well knew Amadis, that ſhe ſpake theſe words, onely to palliate their cloſe affections, wherefore hee would not anſwere her one word: but Oriana ſhaping her courſe to the Queene, ſpake thus. For ought I can perceiue Madam, we muſt take another way now, then going to Rome, and endure our fortunes patiently, becauſe there is no other remedy. Further on ſhee would haue thus proceeded, but that Agraies entred the Cabine, leading Olinda by the hand, which Oriana perceiuing, ſhe left the Queene Sardamira, and came and imbraced them, as one that had not in a longtime ſeene them. The like ſhe did to Floreſtan, Quedragant, and many more, thanking them perticularly, for their ſeuerall fauours done vnto her: eſpecially Garnate, to whom ſhee ſaid. My worthy friend Garnate, but for you, I had beene dead: but the letter you brought me from Floreſtan, did preſently reuiue me. Madame, ſaid he, I did but my duty as very glady I would doe, in all occaſions elſe, you pleaſe to command me.
                  After theſe courteſies, to all that came and preſented themſelues before her; ſhe called Amadis aſide, and ſaid vnto him. Beleeue mee (ſweet friend) if I had gone on but a little further, all your right had beene loſt with mee: but our Lord hath prouided better for vs both, and now I am where willingly I would be. Madam (quoth hee) I haue not done any thing for you, equall to the infinite of your gracious fauours towards mee: and I deſire pardon for your greeuous feare, which this rude encounter could not but put vpon you. I heard none at all, ſaid ſhee, I was ſo ouercome with extreame melancholy & if Mabila had not told me of it, I had bin as vtterly ignorant of any fight, as they that dwell in Great Brittaine. But tell me I pray you, whether are you minded to cary mee? Let mee coniure you (deare ſweet) by all the loue you haue euer borne mee, that ſeeing wee are now met together, and in ſo good company: you would ſpeake nothing to me in any place, that may returne to our preiudice, but when you are willing to command any thing, your Couſine Mabila may eaſilie enterpret betweene vs. My further intent is, to be conuayed to the Encloſed Iſle, where I would gladly be: till heauen afford more fauour for mee, and my Father may vnderſtand

what wrong he hath done me. Let me liue no longer Madame (anſwered Amadis, then to doe you my vttermoſt ſeruice; wherefore you may well perſwade your ſelfe, that your will ſhall any way be accompliſhed. And I hold it very expedient, that you ſhould make your mind known to Agraies, Quedragant and Floreſtan, who couet nothing more, then to pleaſe you with their vttermoſt paines. Well (quoth Oriana) when you meete in counſell together, I will ſend your Couſin to them, to know how they wil diſpoſe of me.
                  So Amadis departed from her, and called all the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle in counſell, to vnderſtand which way they would take. Many contrary opinions paſſed among them, ſome thought it meet, that Oriana ſhould be conueyed to the Encloſed Iſle; others would haue her into Gaule, to king Perion: but the moſt part agreed for SCOTLAND; till Mabila comming to them, ſaid. My Lords, Madame Oriana entreates you, that ſhe may bee conducted to the Encloſed Iſle, vntill her reconciliation with her father King Liſuart. And ſeeing you haue already ſo well begunne this buſines, that, proceeding on from good to better, you would ſtill ſtand faſt for her, as alwayes you haue done for diſtreſſed Ladies and Damoſels requiring your help, with due conſideration had to the quality of her perſon. Madame, anſwered Quedragant, I am ſure, that my Lord Amadis, and al we of his company, are determinately reſolued, to ſerue her till death, without ſpare of coyne, friendes, or any thing elſe remayning in our power, yea, were it againſt the King her father, the Emperour, or any other that dare offend her, not doubting, but by the helpe of God, and the iuſtice of our cauſe in doing her ſeruice, we may lawfully make reſiſtance againſt them. Conſidering alſo, that there is not a man among vs, but hath ſolemnely ſworne, neuer to depart from this aſſociation, vntill ſhe be at perfect liberty. And ſo you may ſafely aſſure her from vs, concerning all which hath bin ſaid, as not to be denyed by any one in this company.
                  
                     Mabila thanking them moſt affectionatly, departed from them, and comming to Oriana, declared what the Knight had ſaid vnto her, wherof ſhe was not a litle ioyful, & inſtantly, all betook themſelues to their ſeueral Ships. And according to their former concluſion, they ſet ſaile for the Encloſed Iſle; where in their voyage we wil leaue them, to make an end of this Third Booke.

THE FOVRTH BOOKE OF AMADIS DE GAVLE.
               
                  Wherein is amply diſcourſed, what end the warre had, begun betweene King Liſuart, and the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle: with the alliances and mariages therevpon enſuing, to the no little contentment of many Louers, and their faire friends.
                  Of the great ſorrow made by the Queene Sardamira, after ſhe vnderſtood the death of the Prince Saluſte Quide: And of the arriuall of Oriana in the Encloſed Iſle.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. 1.
                  
                     BY the diſcourſe of our Third Booke, it hath beene declared to you, how King Liſuart deliuered his daughter Oriaana to the Emperours Ambaſſadours, contrary to the opinion of all the Princes and Lords of his Kingdome; and that ſhe (with the other Ladies and Damoſels that kept her companie) were reſcued by Amadis and his friends; the nauie of the Romains vanquiſhed, Brandaiell de Rocque taken priſoner, the Marques of Ancona, the Archbiſhop of Tarente, and many more beſide. Great was this ouerthrow, wherein none of them eſcaped, but was eithen ſlaine, or taken priſoner. After the conflict was fully ended, and all the Ladies brought together; Amadis (euermore to conceale diſcreetly his loue and Orianaes) went into hir Ship, leauing Angriot and ſome other Knights to keepe company with the women. I Paſſing from Ship to Ship, to make ſuch prouiſion as was thought neceſſary: hee came neere to that wherein Agraies was, and there hee heard the moſt woefull noyſe that could be: demaunding what might be the reaſon thereof, anſwere was made him, that the Romaines bewayled the death of the Prince Saluſte Quide, without any meanes of pacification.
                  Herevpon, Amadis gaue command, that the body (lying ſtill vpon the Orelope) ſhould be put into a Coffin, till they might giue it buriall when they came to land. Then they that before made ſuch ruefull lamentation, being now

bereaued of the body: encreaſed their cries and clamours ſo loude, that they were heard by the Queene Sardamira, who ſat cloſe by the Princeſſe Oriana. When ſhee vnderſtood the cauſe of their complaining, ſhe was ſuddenly ſurpriſed with ſuch extreame ſorrow: as ſhee fell downe on the ground, and weeping bitterly, ſaid. Alaſſe! Fortune hath now apparantly declared, that her mallice extendeth, not onely to the ruine of vs miſerable captiues; but alſo to deſtroy the Emperour and his whole Empire. Ah poore Prince, miſhap hath had too much domination ouer thee! Alaſſe, what loſſe, and what ſorrow (for euer) will they endure, that deerely loued thee, when they ſhall heare of thine vnfortunate end? I know not how thy maiſter himſelfe is able to ſupport this greefe, I rather beleeue, that he ſhall no ſooner heare of theſe ſad newes, but he will immediatly die with extremity of impatience: & ſurely, not without great reaſon, hauing loſt ſo many goodly Ships, ſuch a power of worthy men, and a Prince of ſuch admirable expectation.
                  Then turning to the Princeſſe Oriana, ſhee thus proceeded. Nay Madame, his loſſe of you, is the the greateſt matter of all other, whom he more deſireth, then any thing elſe in the world, and for whom, he will raiſe ſuch rough and ſtrange warres, as will coſt the deare liues of infinite famous and renowned Knights, which cannot be long delayed, except thou (O Emperour) doe ſhew thy ſelfe the moſt childiſh and cowardly minded Prince, that euer any mother brought into the world.
                  During theſe lamentations, ſhe lay ſtill vpon the ground, her armes foulded one within another, and meerely drowning her ſelfe in teares▪ which mooued Oriana to ſuch compaſſion, as, being ouercome with weeping, ſhee was feigne to with-draw thence. Whereupon, Mabila, being more ſtrong & conſtant then any of the reſt, came to the Queene, and ſaid. In good faith Madame, in mine opinion, it ill becomes a Princeſſe, ſo wiſe and well quallified, as you haue alwaies beene reputed, to fall into theſe 
                        •…
                     
                     ties: for the vertue of a diſcreet ſoule, doth neuer ſo well expreſſe it ſelfe, as in the tempeſtuous times of preturbations. 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      that beare the title of a Queene, 
                        •…
                     
                     reaſon, ought to be much more ſetled and conſtant, then a weake Gentlewoman, or any other perſon, vnworthy to hold the place and ranke that you doe. Doe not you know, that fortune is mutable, affording her fauours to whom ſhe pleaſeth, and reuoaking them againe vpon her leaſt diſtemper? Conſider then, that the Emperors Nauie being thus vanquiſhed, and you in the power of the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle: it enſueth vpon meere neceſſity, that you ſhould haue patience, and ſuport this accident with womanly diſcretion, when you can haue no helpe to the contrary. Eſpecially being aſſured, that you are in the power of them, who will doe you all honor, ſeruice, and the very beſt entertainement that can be deuiſed. And though Prince 
                        〈◊〉
                      be dead, what remedy? you cannot recall him againe with your 
                        〈◊〉
                      ſuch chances are but 
                        
                           〈…〉
                         guerra, and common to all that follow ſuch affaires. Wherefore Madame, neuer make your 
                        〈…〉
                      then needs: but, in vſing your 
                        •…
                     
                     ted vertue and fortitude, take 
                        〈…〉
                     
                     ▪ according as they happen, 
                        〈…〉
                      is ineuitable.
                  
                     
The Queene returned her this anſwere. Lady, it is eaſie for him that is in ioy, to comfort (as you doe) one downe caſt with griefe. Neuertheleſſe, if you felt the woe that ouer-maiſtereth me: you would complaine (pehaps) much more then I doe. And yet I well know, that you tell me truth, although it is impoſſible for mee, ſo much to command ouer mine own paſſions, as (inſtantly) to follow your councell. Wherefore (for Gods ſake) let me entreat you, that in excuſing my imperfections, you, and all the Ladies here would rather helpe me, in the due complaint of mine vnrecouerable vnhappineſſe. Madame, anſwered Mabila, if this greefe, which you entreat of vs, would doe you any good, I dare ſweare to you vpon my faith, that in this company there is no one Lady (as I thinke) but willingly would doe it withall her heart. But then you know withall that when it is ſo don; there muſt be (of neceſſitie) an end of your mourning, either by the compulſion of time, or as wiſdome commandeth.
                  Continuing in theſe remonſtrances, Oriana returned to them againe, and found the Queene in more moderation of her ſorrow. During this time, Amadis had giuen order, to hoiſe ſailes, and make for the Encloſed-Iſle, which they diſcouered the third day following: in regarde whereof Gandalin was ſent before in a Skiffe, to aduertiſe Graſinda of their comming, which being vnderſtood by her, ſhe was ſo highly pleaſed, as none could be more: eſpecially when ſhe heard of their victorie, and conqueſt made of ſo many Ladies and Damoſells, but chiefly of Oriana, whom ſhe deſired to ſee more then any other. For which cauſe, ſhe prepared her ſelfe (in the beſt manner ſhe could deuiſe) to entertaine her, preſuming ſo much on her ſelfe, that (without all doubt) ſhe ſhould accompliſh the aduenture of Apolidons Pallace, and attaine to (in her preſence) the verie higheſt degree of honour, that euer Lady or Damoſell might doe.
                  Seeing them approach ſome-what neere, ſhe entred into a Barge to meete them: when Oriana demaunded of Bruneo, of whence, and what ſhee was. Madame, quoth he, I beleeue it is Graſinda, ſhe that ſo lately obtained (by the meanes of Lord Amadis) the prize for beautie, againſt all the faireſt maides and Virgins in the King your fathers Court, and ſurely, I take her to be one of the wiſeſt Ladies, that euer I haue ſeene. Then hee related at large, the honour, gracious entertainement, and fauours ſhe had affoorded them, during their ſoiourning in her Countrie. Beleeue me Sir, ſaid the Princeſſe, you ſhall ſhew your ſelfe very ingratefull to her, if you doe not make due acknowledgement of ſuch courteſie, when ſhe hath occaſion to imploy you.
                  As thus ſhe concluded, Granſinda came aboord their Ship, Angriote ſtepping foorth to helpe her vp, and preſenting her to Oriana, ſaid. Behold Madame, this is the Ladie, to whom my Lord Amadis, Bruneo and I are beholding for our liues. At theſe words, the Princeſſe and Graſinda made reuerence to each other, and ſo paſſing on into the port, they went a ſhoare, many goodly palfrayes (very richly trapt and harneſſed) there wayting to receiue them, whereon they all mounted. Then, being conducted by the Knights, they rode on toward the Pallace of Apolidon, and (by

the way) diſcourſing, what honour Amadis had wonne in King Liſuarts Court, vnder the name of the Greeke Knight: Oriana ſaid to Graſinda, I promiſe you Madame, if I had knowne it, you ſhould not haue had ſuch contentment without me: but I neuer heard of any thing, vntill it was ended. That was my onely ioy, anſwered Graſinda, and the higheſt fauour Fortune could doe me, for if you had beene preſent (conſidering your rare and admirable beautie) I hardly thinke, that my Lord Amadis (how good a Knight ſoeuer hee is) would haue finiſhed his enterpriſe, to his honour and mine: for the Crowne had beene due to you, beyond all other in reaſon, but you being abſent, the Conqueſt only was made for me.
                  As ſhe ended theſe words, ſhe perceiued Amadis to be very nere, and fearing leaſt her liberality of ſpeech had offended him; in excuſing her ſelfe, ſhe prayed him to pardon her. For neuer (quoth ſhee) did mine eyes hope to behold, ſo abſolute a beauty as this of Madame Oriana, therefore I cannot but confeſſe her right aboue all other. Amadis being not a little pleaſed, to heare her ſo highly commended, whom (beyond all things elſe) he moſt eſteemed, ſmiling, thus replied. By my faith, I ſhould confeſſe my ſelfe voide of all good iudgement, if I ſhould thinke ill of the honour you doe to Madame Oriana, ſhe deſeruing the title of the moſt vertuous Princeſſe that I know. Oriana, ſomething abaſhed at ſuch great praiſes: could not ſo well containe her ſelfe, but that a vermillion bluſh lept vp into her face, which made her appeare tenne times more perfect. Neuertheleſſe, thinking more on her inſtant happie Fortune, then the due merit of her beautie, ſhe ſaid to Graſinda. I will not now contradict the good opinion, which it hath pleaſed you to conceiue of mee, for then I ſhould conteſt with a perſon of moſt pregnant iudgement: it ſuffiſeth mee, I dare aſſure you, that (ſuch as I am) all my life time, I ſhall wiſh your welfare and aduancement, ſo much as lies in the power of a poore diſinherited Lady to doe, for now you ſee me in no better condition.
                  So long laſted this kinde of diſcourſing, that they arriued at the Pallace of Apolidon, where they all alighted with the Princeſſe Oriana. Now, becauſe it was one of the moſt ſumptuous buildings in all the world: I thought it not a miſſe, to deſcribe it by writing.
               
               
                  CHAP. II.
                  
                     A deſcription of the Lignographi
                           •
                        , and foundation of the Pallace, which Apohdon had cauſed to be builded in the Encloſed Iſle.
                  
                  
                     THE foundation of this moſt magnificent Pallace, with the Parke and Garden together, was quadrangle, and contained in length, ſixe hundred, twentie fiue fadomes, and in breadth, three hundred, three ſcore and fifteene: allowing ſixe foote to the 
                        〈◊〉
                     , the foote to conſiſt of twelue inches, and euery inch ſixe Barlie comes in length, walled about with a high wall of black-marble, with Dorick Colomnes

of white-marble. At the front of this foundation, was planted the Pallace, which had in his ſquare, an hundred, fortie and one fadomes, and at the foure corners, was exalted foure huge Towers, one of Azure ſtone; the ſecond of Iris or Opall-ſtone; the third of Chriſolite; and the fourth of Iaſper; which had in the Diameter of their circumference, eight fadomes, two foote, and three inches. In each of them was two Chambers, foure warderobes, and as many Cabinets: comprehending in theſe, the Defended Chamber, which was in the Tower of Azureſtone.
                  Now, in regard it was the moſt excellent of the reſt, I will deſcribe the ſingularities thereof ſeuerally to you. It was wainſcotted about with vnicornes horne, faſhioned like to the feete of Lampes, frettized with Lignum, Aloes, Balme and Cedar, all wrought in antique engrauerie with fine gold, thickly embelliſhed with enamelled flourets. The pauement was of Chriſolite, carued in loue knots, enriched with Corall and Cipres, cut in little ſcales, and faſtened with threds of gold. The doore and window worke was of Ebonie, enchaſed with ſiluer mouldes, and the glaſſe all Chriſtall. All the chinks and crannies of the Warderobes and Cabinets, were ſtuffed with Agats, cut in Lozenges, wherein (euen as it were naturally) infinit figures of all kinde of creatures were plainely to be ſeene. In the roofe of this Chamber hung two Lampes of gold, at the bottomes whereof were enchaſed two Carbuncles, which gaue ſo bright a ſolendour round about the roome, that there was no neede of any other light.
                  But all this riches was of ſlender value, in regard of a Mirrour or Looking-glaſſe of white Saphire, the onely orientall that euer was ſeene, which had three feete in ſquare, ſtanding vpon a plate of gold, ſo bordered and garniſhed with great Diamonds, Emeralds, Rubies and Pearles, as neuer was ſeene a thing more to be admired. Betweene thoſe foure Towers, whereof I haue told you, were ſeated foure faire great Halls, all of equall largeneſſe, the worke being throughout of Porphirie-ſtone, with Dorick pillers, contayning thirtie foote in height, fixed vpon baſes of braſſe, couered with Chapeans of gold, vnder Architranes of Porſeline, vpon which were Frizes of Iuorie, with diuers deuiſes in all languages: and aboue thoſe Frizes, were Corniſhes of Topaze, enriched with Turkeſſes. Directly facing the portall of this Pallace, had Apolidon formerly placed thoſe Perrons, whereof we haue ſpoken in the firſt and ſecond Bookes, and next to them, the Arke of loyall Louers, as already you had heard.
                  Paſſing on further, you ſhould enter into a very goodly Court, contayning three and fiftie fadomes in ſquare, Orthogonally cornered by iuſt leuell of line, being paued with Iaſper-ſtone, wrought in workes after the Moſa
                        •
                     
                     call manner: vnder which was a dungeon in the middle ſquare, being one & fiftie fadoms & an halfe in depth, and in the midſt thereof was a double vice, for letting down and mounting againe, contayning nine fadomes. In the Diameter round about were foure other ſumptuous Halls, of twentie fadomes in height, deuided by other Towers, of no leſſe beautie then the former. The winding

ſtaires conducting to them, were of guilded copper, made in the forme of a lanterne, retained by bowing pillers, and ſuſtained with Atticque Collomnes of Crateriteſtone (very hard to cut) after the ancient manner, and the mounting of theſe ſtaires met not together, neither by line Orthogonall, or Ambligonall in angle.
                  This dungeon had foure ſtages or roomes vpon one platforme, wherein were ſixteene great lodgings, and in the midſt roſe vp the gyring ſtaire, and foure Pauillions, beſide the foure Towers wee ſpake of before, which with the ſaid Pauillions, ſurmounted the platforme of two ſtages vnder couerture. Now, to tell you whereof this dungeon was made, you muſt vnderſtand, that the firſt ſtage was of Chalcidonie-ſtone, enriched with Dorick collomnes of very white Alablaſter, with mouldes and appurtenances anſwereable to the others height. The ſecond ſtage or roome, was of greene Marble, brought from Alexandria, enriched with Ionick collomnes of fiue Topas, mouldings, heads, baſes and ſeatings like to the other. The third ſtage was of red Marble, with ſpeckled Corinthian collomnes of Iuorie. And the fourth was of Iacinthe, with Proeſme Tuſcane collomnes of Emerald.
                  Eaſily might theſe repeated platformes beſeene, vnder which were the foure ſtages, paued with Poiſeline, as alſo thoſe of the foure Pauillions, and all the reſt ſurmounting the chiefe plat formes, made of wood of Cypres, Codar and Cethin, which cannot be toucht by any corruption, couered with mother of Pearle, and the reſt of them with glaſſe of fine tranſparant ſteele, knit together with fillets of gold. All the portalls of the Pallace were of pure Alablaſter, wrought in the forme of damaske worke, with mouldings, tympaines and frontiſſons of Amber, and Vermillion Agath: whereon were curiouſly engrauen in antique ſhapes (euidently to bee knowne) many battailes and redoubted ſeruices, as well of the Greekes and Romans, as of the Gaules: and vnderneath them, the Images of Prapus Mars and Apollo, with thoſe other of Venus, Ceres and Miaerua of the beſt polliſhed white marble that euer was ſeene. And Apolidon cauſed the moulding workes and portalls, to be expreſſely made of Diamonds, to the end, that as they were opened, they might ſhut againe of themſelues, euen by the meere vertue of that ſtone. The Pauillions and Towers were ſeuerally garniſhed, with ſixe and fifty Chambers, foure-ſcore Warderobes, and as many double Cabinets, the beſt guilded and adorned that poſſibly might be.
                  Paſſing through this ſecond Court, entrance was into a Garden, where, according to the deſcribed meaſure of the buildings quarter, it was naturally planted withall kindes of ſluores and good hearbes that could be deſired. In the midſt thereof ſtood a goodly fountaine, the water iſſuing from the two dugges of a Venus, mode of Agath (mounted on a great piller of Emerald proeſme) and falling into an huge Baſen of Azure ſtone. This Image was ſo ingeniouſly cut and ſhaped, as nothing but ſpeech wanted: becauſe the Agath did ſo truely agree and come neere to nature, as Venus (in her 
                        〈…〉
                     ) was not more beautifull. Shee held in her right hand (ſomewhat higher aduanced then the other)

the ſelfe ſame golden Apple, which Paris adiudged to her, when he was made the arbi rator for the three gaddeſſes in Ida Forreſt, whereon followed that vnfortunate warre, betweene the Greekes and the Troyans. This Apple was afterward ſtolne from Venus by Iuno through the meanes of iealous Vulcane, and then in following time (going from hand to hand) happened to Apolidon, who found it among the vnualuable treaſures of the King his father: with the Pearle (otherwiſe tearmed the Vnton) which Cleopatra long time had in her poſſeſſion, after the had quaft off the other in the company of Marke Anthonie. And this Peaſle alſo hung at the left care of the ſame Goddeſſe, and was ſo ordered by Arte; as it could by no meanes be taken away, till the faire creature that entred the Defended Chamber, had drunke of the water of that cleere Fountaine. And then the Image would preſent the Pearle and Apple to her, as worthie to haue the chiefeſt honour for perfect beauty.
                  In her other eare hung the Ring of Pyrrhus, wherein was an Agate enchaſed, whereon (by moſt wounderfull admiration, and varietie of nature) the nine Muſes were figured according to life, with Apollo holding his Harpe: whereof Peſpaſian made ſo high account, that he eſteemed

                      and Amuſt, thirty foote in height. At two corners, which directly confronted the Patke, they had winne in building, a Chamber, a Warderobe and a Cabinet double ſtaged. The nether part or floore of theſe Galleries, was painted (by moſt exquiſite Painters) with all the ſeuerall kindes of hunting and fowling: for there might be diſcerned (to the life) what delight Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen take, being ſo aſſembled together, ſitting or lying on the freſh greene hearbes, to heare the Huntſmans pleaſing report, who ſoone after might be ſeene, ſeeking all about with his hound in a line, queſtyning after the ſtricken Hart. And by the countenance of the man, he ſeemed to winde his horne a long while, to giue notice, that he had found the fall of the deare.
                  Beſide, in emboſſing or moulded workes, were the other hounds to be ſeene, that gaue report of his defeature, or death, with the horſe-men galloping after them, mainly on the bridle, with their Bugles at their mouthes (and ſwolne bigge cheekes) appearing ſo pleaſing to the eye, as it almoſt gaue euident perſwaſion, that the ayre made reuerberation of the noiſe, euen as if it had beene performed indeed. But aboue all, what is he, that would not be extraordinarily delighted, beholding the Stagge in the full honour of his head, running ſtrongly, breaking through the brakes and buſhes, croſſing one the lands, holding his head aloft, and his tongue their 
                        〈◊〉
                     , laboriouſly to winne the neereſt water: while the hounds are at defcult, by the Deares diuerſitie of leapes, ſhifts and other eſcapes? All which yet is nothing, to ſee him forced from the ſoile, and compelled to the bay when the hounds ſwiftly running, hang vpon his haunches, loudly proclayming his death, and then haue their

reward for their labour.
                  A little further off, was the hunting of the wilde Boare or Swine, whom the Lime-hound had forced to forſake the buſhes, and driuen to paſſe along by Grey-hoūds; whereupon, the beaſt being fierce and furious, at the winding of the hornes, ran among the hounds and hunters, grunting, ſnoring and ouerthrowing whatſoeuer he met withall. And that which was worſt of all, with his long and ſharpe Tuſhes, he bit and kilde the boldeſt Grey hounds that durſt encounter him, notwithſtanding the beſt contriued Iacks, made for defence of their bodies. But the Huntſmen, being quick and ready, making at him with their Boareſpeares, and wounding him deepely, layde him all along. Then, being able to contend no longer with the hounds, flocking round about him, ſome tugging him by the coddes, others by the eares and thighes, would neuer ceaſe vntill he was dead. Aſſuredly, it would require much length of time, to deſcribe (in due order) the ſeuerall kindes of hunting, and the like ſportes, painted all along this pleaſant Gallerie. And the Painter deſerued no meane commendation, for the extraordinarie excellencie of his worke: eſpecially, his admirable perſpectiue, in the deſcription of Hawking, which was figured meerely to the life. Among others, the flight at the Heron, followed by three Sacres toward the mountaines, where ſhe ſoared ſo high, as ſhee might be diſcerned within the clouds. Then ſuddenly ſhe began to diſcend, and being fiercely purſued, fell downe to the ground, where the hounds were ready to receiue her.
                  If theſe paintings affoorded ſuch pleaſing contentment, much more then did they in the higher Gallerie, where was figured the moſt part of the battailes betweene Semiramis and Ninus; the ouerthrow of Aſtiages by the Perſians; the death of Marcheſia, Queene of the Amazones, in the Country of Aſia; the diſcomfiture of Cyrus by Queene Thomiris; the aſſaults of Hercules againſt Androgeus and Otreus; the flight of Vexores, King of Egypt, aſſailed by the Scythians, and infinite other fights, well deſcruing eternall memorie. The pauements of theſe Galleries were thus ſingularly beautified, being of Iarecote, blacker then any Moore, and the ſeeling formed in Oualls, made of Zedroſus, the bone of a fiſh, which the Kings of Arabia hold in high eſteeme. The walls were of pure ſiluer, wrought with curious Antiques, and enammelled beaſts: the gutters and water paſſages of Alablaſter, extending long out frō the walls, betweene arteficiall Croſſelets, enriched with golden leaues, and other workes cut after damaſking manner. The doores and windowes (in their wood worke) were of Ebonie, and the glaſſe wholly of baſtard Diamond.
                  Going from hence, they entred into the Parke, contayning three hundred Acres of woods, enuironed and planted with Pines, Cipres trees, Laurells, Holmes, Palmes and Terebinthine trees. Therein were diuers delectable and pleaſant Arbours, appearing, as if Nature had contended with her owne skill, not onely to make them ſingular, but admirable alſo: for there were an infinite number of Orenge trees, Date trees, Citron trees, and Myrtle trees, all iuſtly planted by the line, with other the very ſweeteſt fruitages, that poſſibly

in the world could be wiſhed for. On the other ſide was a meadow, watered by a great many little Riuers, by meanes whereof, the ground brought forth ſtore of delectable hearbes, with Violets, Daiſies, Paunſies, and other moſt odorifferous floures.
                  Yearely, in the month of May, came the Phoenix (as a Gardiner) thither, and for the amenitie of the place, tooke ſuch pleaſure to be there: that there ſhe caſt her feathers, ſo ſoone as Apolidon had perfected the enchantments of his Pallace, which was moſt ſſumptuous and magnificent. Wherefore, cauſing her feathers to be dilligently gathered, he made them vp in a 
                        ••
                     nne, with a rich diamond in the 
                        ••
                     dſt and of ſuch largeneſſe, that it eaſilie ſerued for a looking-glaſſe, annexed with the very goodlieſt Emerauld, and the greateſt Rubie, that euer had beene ſeene. And Apolidon appointed (when he departed thence for Conſtantinople) that this precious Fanne, ſhould be kept among the other ſingularities of the Iſle, as the moſt excellent thing of all other: wherefore Amadis preſented it to Oriana, on the ſame day when ſhe landed there.
                  And to the end, that this pleaſant place might continue embelliſhed, with all things that poſſibly could bee had: Apolidon leſt there two Vnicornes, which the Prince of Quinſay had ſent him, and there they liued ſo long, that King Liſuart found them there, after the mariage was ſollemnized, between the Princeſſe Oriana and Amadis. Moreouer, there were many Ciuet and Maske-cattes, which made the ayre ſo extraordinarily ſweete, as nothing could bee therewith compared: and ſometimes the Pellicane alſo made her ſent there. Great ſtore of other worthy creatures liued there alſo, as Harts, Hindes, Roes, Goates, Hares, Connies &c. withall diuerſitie of Birdes and Fowles, as it was wonderfull to heare the varietie of their noates, eſpecially the Nightingale, and the ſolitarie Owſell, affecting alwaies to be alone.
                  From forth of a nere neighbouring high Rocke, deſcended a great water, which filled the Lake, whereof you haue heard i
                        •
                      the ſecond Booke, where the Hart loſt his life, narrowly purſued by the hounds, as hath beene already related. And thither vſually reſorted the Beuer to bathe himſelfe, with an infinite number of Swannes, Cignets, Cranes, Storkes, Cormorants, Heronnes, with a plentifull ſtore of all other Birdes. But all theſe made not this Lake ſo ſingular, as the frequent reſort of a Maremaide, which was heard there (were neere) continually ſinging, as neuer was heard more delectable hermony. From this Lake iſſued many Riuers and Currents, which made diuers little Iſlands in this Meadow. In one of them was a Dedalus or Labyrinth, contayning onely foure Acres in ſquare, planted with the moſt precious Balme, that euer grew in Engadia. And it was continually kept by two Serpents, bred of his kinde, that watcht the golden Apples in the Garden of Heſperides day and night.
                  Directly in the midſt of this Dedalus, was a Coloſſus of guilded Braſſe, contayning the height of ſixe ſcore Cubites, holding in his left hand (raiſed vp on his head) a Lanterne of Chriſtall, and in it, the rod yet burning, wherewith Prometheus kept the fire which he ſtole

from heauen: yeelding ſuch a bright ſplendour day and night (without diminiſhing) that for the ſpace of an hundred miles, round in compaſſe, the Mariners made their reſort thither, as they did to Pharos neere Alexandria.
                  
                  This flaming Rod, Apolidon had gotten (by great induſtrie) from the Prieſts and Magitians of Chaldea: And whoſoeuer could looke on this vnextinguiſhable fire, in his true nature, and without couering in this manner, hee ſhould attaine to moſt mighty prouidence. But the Serpents kept the place very ſtrongly, without doing any harm, to them that tooke delight in the Parke: prouided, that they preſumed not to enter the Dedalus, for then they would belch forth ſuch fire and flames, as was able to daunt the boldeſt ſpirit. And all this was thus ordained by Apolidon who was (as you haue formerly heard) one of the very greateſt Enchanters in all the world: yet, when the matchleſſe beautie, entring into the Defended Chamber, ſhould come neere to this Coloſſus, the Enchantments muſt ceaſe, and eaſilie might this admired fire bee looked on.
                  Now, gentle Readers, conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelues, if the like Pallace can now a dayes bee eaſily found, accompanied with ſuch plentie of ſingularities, as Oriana ſaw there? To proceed on now in our Hiſtorie, the Ladies and Gentlewomen being brought to their ſeueral lodgings: the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle departed from them, committing them to their good reſt, becauſe (in deed) it was ſomewhat late. Neuertheleſſe, the Princeſſe Oriana (all that night) could not ſleepe, partly through wearineſſe on the Sea, and partly by her fearefull conceite, of harme that might enſue to Amadis, vpon this bold and hardie aduenture, which gaue her ſome reaſon to fore-thinke, of an inteſtine warre betweene him and King Liſuart. And now ſhe beganne to conſider with her ſelfe, that to palliate the earneſt affection betweene them, there was neceſſarily required: that ſhe ſhould gouerne her ſelfe much more diſcreetly, then formerly ſhe had done to kill all occaſion of ill conceiuing of her.
                  Hereupon, the next morning, ſhee ſent to Amadis and the other Knights, requeſting to haue a little conference with them, and they, who deſired nothing more, then to ſerue and honour her: came immediatly vpon her commande, and after courteſies paſt on either ſide, Quedragant, who had charge from the whole companie, to vnderſtand her will, ſaid. Madame, as we are enfourmed, you haue ſent to ſpeake with vs, let vs know what you will pleaſe to command vs? In good faith Sir, anſwered the Princeſſe, commaunds are no matters for mee, eſpecially to them, in whoſe power I am as a priſoner, you may ſpeake your pleaſure. Madame, quoth hee, but there is not a man among vs, who is not willing to do you any ſeruice. Oriana returned him many thankes, and then replied thus. Let mee entreate you then to bee ſo pleaſed, that during the time of my reſiding in this place, my women and I may be ſeuered from all other company, and alſo to promiſe vs, that none of you (whoſoeuer it bee) may come to ſee vs, without our leaue and permiſſion: for you well know, that the ſurprizall you haue made of vs, and of the Emperours people, being once divulged abroade, it will

be hard, to comprehend the end of your intention, and our innocence, but ſpeeches may paſſe to diſaduantage. But when they ſhall heare the religion, wherein we deſire to liue, till ſuch time as the King my father recall mee into his good opinion: I am perſwaded, that eaſilie they will conuert their harſh language, into honeſt excuſes for vs all, who (together) make this requeſt ſo reaſonable to you wherein (we hope) you will yeeld vs no de

Euery man among them affirmed as much, allowing highly of her wiſdome and prouidence. And albeit Amadis imagined this their ſeperation a little too rigorous (hauing no other felicity in the world, then to be in her preſence) yet he was feigne to diſſemble it: being a matter ſo reaſonable, and for the conſeruation of her honour, whom he affected as his life. Hoping notwithandſting, that though the day time denied him ſuch an happineſſe, yet the night would bleſſe him ſomewhat better, albeit not ſo often as hee could wiſh it.
               
               
                  CHAP III.
                  
                     Of the Councell held among the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, touching the buſineſſe for the Princeſſe Oriana, and what they further determined to doe.
                  
                  
                     YOV haue formerly heard the victory, which Amadis had againſt the Romans, by meanes whereof, he got Oriana into his poſſeſſion, and the other Ladies that bare her companie, which he accounted the happieſt of all his other fortunes: albeit he fore-ſaw in his ſoule, that very hardly hee ſhould appeaſe the iniury, which he had done not onely to King Liſuart, but alſo to the Emperour. In regard where-of, queſtioning with his owne thoughts, that it would require no meane might, to withſtand ſuch potent Armies, as from either ſide would be made againſt him: yet notwithſtanding, hope, conducted by the power of loue, gaue him this reſolution, rather to die a thouſand deaths, then redeliuer her to Patin, without whom hee could not liue an houre. He made no doubt of compaſſing ſome meanes, to regaine her the former grace of the King her father, and to breake the alliance elſe-where intended; which that he might the better attaine vnto, hee gaue the Prince Agrates and Quedragant to vnderſtand, that the Princeſſe had ſent to pray this fauour. For otherwiſe (quoth he) ſhe intendeth rather to make a Sacrifice of her ſelfe, then to fall into his power, whom ſhe more hateth then any man liuing: Beſide, it ſhall no way redound to our honour, to ſuffer ſuch a monſtrous ſhame, hauing made ſo great and good a beginning for her deliuerance.
                  
                     Quedragant returned him this

anſwere. I ſweare vnto you Sir, at our firſt and giddie-headed eyeſight, we ſee ſo great a fire already kindled, as (we may eaſily preſume) is impoſſible to be quenched without a hard and daungerous warre, which we may not well maintaine and endure for any long time, without the ayde and ſuccour of our deare friends and companions, wherefore, I thinke it expedient, that all the reſt which are here, ſhould be made acquainted there-with, to know their opinions; to the end, that they may be the better enclined to ſuſtaine the buſineſſe, if they ſhall conclude on warre. I pray you then, ſaid Amadis, that we may all meete together tomorrow, and take the charge (if you pleaſe) to ſummon them, wherto Quedragant gladly condiſcended.
                  Hereupon, the day following, they met together, and Amadis, ſitting in the midſt of them, beganne in this maner. Honourable Lords, yeſterday, Madame Oriana ſent to pray me, that we all would conſider one ſome good meanes, to winne againe the loſt grace and fauour for her, with the offended King her father, qualifying in him (if it bee poſſible) that ſtrange conceit of his, to marry her with the onely Prince in the world, to whom ſhe beareth the leaſt affection; otherwiſe, death will be much more welcome to her. And therefore I thought it good (after I had ſpoken with ſome of this company particularly) to vnderſtand from you all in generall, what you thinke thereof: For, ſeeing wee haue beene friends and companions, in the procuring of her libertie; it is much more reaſonable, that we ſhould all agree to maintaine it.
                  But before I enter into further ſpeech, I humbly deſire you, to fixe before your eyes, that (already) your fame & renowne is ſo knowne through the world, by reaſon of the rare actions of Chiualry by you performed: that (at this day) there is neither King, Prince nor State, but ſtand in feare of your high valour. For they all well know, that to winne immortall honour, you haue contemned, not onely the ſumptuous treaſures and kinde entertainments, inherent to you in your owne houſes: but the deare blood of your owne bodies, where-of you haue made no ſpare, in giuing the boldeſt ſpirits to know, the ſharpe and keene edges of your ſwords, to the mightie perill of your owne perſons. And, as markes and teſtemonies of your proweſſe, the wounds receiued in many parts of your bodies, may render ſuch apparant faith, as Fortune thinkes her ſelfe much obliged to you: being willing to ſhew you, how much her owne ſelfe is in debted to you. And being deſirous to recompence your former high deſeruings, ſhe made plaine proofe thereof by deliuering this glorious victorie into your hands, which you haue had againſt the two chiefeſt Princes of Chriſtendome, King Liſuart and the Roman Emperor.
                  Nor doe I ſpeake, concerning the ouerthrow of their men onely, being farre inferiour to you in merit: but of the worthie ſuccour you haue giuen, to the moſt wiſe, debonnaire, and vertuous Lady this day liuing. Wherein you haue done a very acceptable ſeruice to God, by executing that dutie, whereunto you are expreſſely called: namely to ſuccour the a
                        •…
                     ted, whē they are to endure wrongs beyond all reaſon. Now, if the King and Emperour thinke it good

to be angrie, yet, ſeeing right is on our ſide, and God (who is iuſt) will ſtand for vs alſo: let vs giue them to vnderſtand, that if their owne experience cannot teach them iuſtice, but by might and power they meane to aſſaile vs; we are able to meete them with ſuch reſiſtance, as ſhall remaine in memory while the world endureth. Therefore, let euery man ſpeake his minde in this caſe, what he conceiueth meeteſt to be done, either to finiſh the war begun: or elſe to motion peace, by reſtoring Madame Oriana to the King her father, according to her owne deſire. For, as concerning my ſelfe, know, that I will neuer yeeld thereto, except you be ſo pleaſed, nor ſhall fond opinion ouerſway me in this matter, beyond the compaſſe ſo your liking. I know you to be men indeed, and your vertues of apparant: as nothing can withdraw you from true valour and magnanimitie, neither to aduenture on any action, whereby your honour (in how ſmall a degree ſoeuer) may receiue any baſe imputation.
                  So he ceaſed, leauing the mindes of all the companie highly contented and ſatiſfied, by ſuch an humble and gracefull remonſtrance, as he had made vnto them. Then Quedragant (commaunded thereto by all the aſſiſtants) ſtood vp, and anſwered Amadis in this manner. Lord Amadis, it is moſt certaine, that our attempt made vpon the Emperour, was not for any hatred wee bare to him: but onely to keepe the faith, whereto euery good Knight ſtandeth obliged, in maintayning and defending afflicted perſons from wrong, eſpecially all vertuous Ladies, of whom it is our dutie to be protectours. And therefore I would aduiſe, that before we vndertake any further warre; wee ſhould ſend to King Liſuart, to let him fully vnderſtand, vpon what occaſion we dealt with the Romans. And if he be found diſcontented; then, in the verie mildeſt manner can bee deuiſed, to ſhew him withall gracious demeanour) what ſhamefull iniurie he offered to Madame Oriana, vnder collour of marrying her to a forraigne Prince, vtterly to diſinherit her at home, a matter euery way offenſiue to God, and not to bee ſuffred by his owne Subiects.
                  Pauſing a very little while, and clapping his fiſt vpon the boorde, thus he proceeded▪ If therefore it may ſtand with his good pleaſure, to forget his conceiued anger againſt her (if there be any entred into his royall breſt) then we to offer deliuerie of her againe, on this condition, and not elſe. If he refuſe or diſdaine the dutie, wherein we ſend vnto him: then to tell him reſolutely, wee feare him not a iote, but if he will make warre vpon vs, we are as ready to defend our ſelues. In the meane while, I hold it very neceſſarie, that wee ſtrengthen our ſelues with all ſuch things, as an action of ſuch importance doth require, as this is. At leaſt, that he may not come vpon vs vnprouided, whenſoeuer hee determines to aſſaile vs (if he be ſo minded) albeit, in mine opinion, peace were much better then warre. But this concluſion is not to be tardied by any meanes, rather we muſt put our ſelues in due preparation, diſpatching hence meſſengers to our kinred and friends, to ſupply vs with their beſt ſuccour, when we ſhall require it.
                  Such was the anſwere of Quedragant, and approued by all the

Knights there preſent: whereupon it was concluded, that Amadis ſhould ſend a meſſenger to his father King Perion of Gaule, alſo Agraies into Scotland, Brunco to the Marqueſſe his father, and Quedragant to the Queene of Ireland, of whom he ſhould haue many able men, if her husband King Cildadan brought no worſe, then he did to the ayde of King Liſuart. This was made knowne to the Princeſſe Oriana, and their finall deliberation for procurement of peace.
                  As thus they continued in theſe conferences, ſome of them ſtanding in the gazing windowes, which had full view vpon the fields: they eſpied comming from the coaſt, that gaue entrance into the Iſle, a Knight all armed, with fiue Squires attending on him, who when hee drew neerer, they knew him to be Briande Moniaſte, ſonne to Lazadan, King of Spaine, of whoſe arriuall they were all right ioyfull for hee was an amiable, bold and hardie Knight, and as courteous as any whatſoeuer. Hee eſpying ſo great a company there together, vpon their comming foorth to meete him: began to grow doubtfull, that they had heard ſome euill tyding of Amadis, for whoſe ſake and ſearch hee had expreſſely left the King his fathers Court. But perceiuing, that their intention was to ſalute him, and ſeeing Amadis there among them: he inſtantly alighted, and running to embrace him, ſaid. Truſt me, my Lord, the queſt I vndertooke to heare newes of you, is ſooner ended then I expected: for I was giuen to vnderſtand, that you were ſo cloſely hid, as it was a matter impoſſible to finde you, but God be praiſed for it, me thinkes I ſee you in very ſound health. Couſine, quoth Amadis, you are moſt kindely welcome hether, aſſuring you, that as Fortune hath releaſed you from one toyle and trauaile: ſo now ſhe hath as readily fitted you with an other, anſwerable both to to the time and place, where your preſence and imployment may much auaile vs, as you hereafter ſhall heare more at large. In the meane while, I thinke it conuenient, that you ſhould be diſarmed, and then wee will tell you our mindes afterward.
                  So taking him by the hand, hee conducted him to his lodging, where, as they were taking off his Armes, ſeeing ſuch ſtore of Knights flocke more and more about him, he ſayd to Amadis. My Lord, I am verily perſwaded, that ſo faire an aſſembly of worthy and valiant men, could neuer be thus met together, but vpon ſome extreame vrgent cauſe: therefore, I pray you tell me what it is. Hereupon, Amadis amply related to him, how, and in what manner all things had paſt, eſpecially the churlliſh ingratitude, which King Liſuart vſed, not onely to the Knights that had done him infinite ſeruices: but alſo to his owne children, enforcing one of them (through ouergreedie and great auarice) to bee diſinherited from her right, and (meerely againſt her will) ſent to Rome, to be wife to the Emperour, and that is Madame Oriana. And this is the cauſe, that ſo many of vs are here aſſembled together? quoth Brian, is the Princeſſe Oriana at Rome? No, replied Amadis, we haue forcibly taken her from the Romans, that had the charge of her conuoy: And now at this preſent, ſhee is here in this Pallace, with all the Ladies, and Gentlewomen that were in her companie. Now ſhall

we eaſily redeliuer thē, except King Liſuart determine more reſpect of them, then hitherto he hath done.
                  Afterward, he told him what was reſolued on by them all, which Brian liked as well as they: albeit hee conceiued, that the iniuries of two ſuch potent Princes (by this defeature) would not bee ſuddenly appeaſed. Notwithſtanding, ſeeing that which was done, could not be recalled: he diſſembled his cogitations, and onely anſwered thus. I know King Liſuart, to be one of the moſt reuengefulleſt Princes this day liuing, and very hard to endure an iniurie, therefore, you muſt quickly conſider on ſome reſiſtance, if he ſhall offer to aſſaile you: and I hold it more requiſite, to take order for all inconueniences which may enſue by his means, then to conſume time in friuolous words. Of one thing I am highly glad, that Madame Oriana and her women haue ſo happie a retirement, and I would gladly ſee her, if you pleaſe. Let me tell you Sir, anſwered Amadis, my Couſine Agraies, and my Brother Floreſtan are appointed, to make her acquainted with our deliberation, and you may goe along with them: being well aſſured, that it will be no meane eaſe to her, to conferre with you on her misfortunes in priuate.
                  No time was delayed in going to her, but before they would preſume to enter her lodgings; they ſent her word, that they came to her from the whole company. Hereupon, their entrance was admitted, and ſhe went to meete them: eſpecially Brian, whom ſhe had not ſeene in a long time, and therefore as he did her reuerence, ſhe ſaid vnto him. Couſine, you are come hither in a very good time, to defend the libertie of a Lady, who ſtands in great neede of ſuch helpe as yours. Madame, ſaid he, I had not ſo long delayed my comming hither, but that preſently, after the ſeuen Kings ouerthrow in Great Brittaine: the King my father commanded my home returne, to with-ſtand the warre, which the people of Affrica made vpon him. And ſcarſely was it ended, but I vnderſtood, my Couſine Amadis was ſo farre diſtant from his friends, through ſome conceiued griefe or diſpleaſure; as no tidings could be heard of him. Wherefore, fearing leaſt he was loſt for euer, I reſolued to enter vpon his queſt, both in the loue and reuerence I beare vnto him. This was the occaſion that drew mee from Spaine, being fully perſwaded, that I ſhould ſooner haue notice of him here, then in any other place elſe whatſooner. And Fortune (I thanke her) hath guided mee hither, where I haue met with apt occaſion, not onely to doe him ſeruice, but alſo for you, royall Princeſſe; for which great kindneſſe, Oriana returned him infinite thankes.
                  But now, before I paſſe on any further, I thinke it very neceſſarie to tell you, what was the principall motiue and reaſon, why ſo many good Knights and worthy men, ſhould beare ſuch honour and good will to this Princeſſe. Aſiure your ſelues, it was not for any guifts or preſents ſhe had beſtowed on them, ſhe being (as yet) voide of all meanes to that effect. Much leſſe, for any fauour by Amadis borne to her, the loue betweene them both being kept ſo ſecret, as you haue heard at large in the precedent Bookes. But indeed, ſhe was ſo humble, wiſe and debonnaire, that by her meere humility

and courteſie, ſhee knew how to ſteale the heartie affections of euery one. A matter ſo apt and proper to heroyick perſons, and them deriued from great place: as they haue no other powers or faculties, but ſuch as make them to bee more honoured, praiſed and eſteemed.
                  Conſider then, in what reputation they ought to be held, who (by ouer-ſtrange perſumpſion) haue delight in all immodeſt behauiour, when all is duely weighed, they beget the peoples disfauour, a ſecret contempt among all good mindes; yea, and diſtaſte of many of their owne appearing wel-willers, that particularly deſire their ruine, to abate the ouer-weening pride, they take in ſuch wickedneſſe. Gracious language, apprehenſiue grauitie, and humble modeſtie, are ſo proper and peculiar to Princes and great perſons, that whenſoeuer they but ſpeake: it begetteth their ſubiects cordiall loue, abſolute obedience, with a generall foare of offending; And the contrary is ſo deadly daungerous, as nothing can be more harmfull to them. Let vs conceiue then, how well it agrees with a knot of ſuch baſe minded companions, to put on a boaſting ſpirit of brauerie: as thinking by their outward glorious appearance, to make them-ſelues reſpected and feared. Before God, mee thinkes they ſhould conſider, both what they are, and what they ſhall bee: then they may eaſily know of them-ſelues, that they are full of ſhame and all diſgrace, and for ſuch, I am content to leaue them, returning againe to our former purpoſe.
                  Vnderſtand now, that after Oriana had a long while conuerſed with Brian: ſhee called for the Queene Sardamira, and ſaid vnto her. See Madame, here is the ſonne to the King of Spaine, I am ſure you know him yet. Then the Queene going neerer to him, after ſhe had very graciouſly ſaluted Brian; entred into ſo ſerious a diſcourſe with him, that Oriana found the meanes of leauing them together. So, with drawing her ſelfe aſide, ſhe called Agrates and Floreſtan to her: entreating them earneſtly, to acquaint her with the cauſe of their comming. Agraies wholly related to her, whatſoeuer had paſſed among them in councell, what true and honorable affection all the Knights did beare her: and laſtly, what reſolution they had agreed on, concerning her cauſe, deſiring her withall, to ſend backe her minde, whether ſhe liked their intention, or no. Alas Sir, quoth ſhe, they are all ſo wiſe and vertuous, as no bad thought can preuaile among them. One thing I would moſt humbly requeſt of them, that (euen for Gods ſake) to ſeeke ſome meanes, if poſſibly they may, and agreeing with their honour; to worke my peace with the diſpleaſed King my father.
                  Then, pretending to whiſper ſome thing in the eare of Agraies, Floreſtan (as one not to learne ciuility) retired thence, leauing them both together. When Oriana perceiued ſhe might ſpeake at libertie: ſhe began her womed

Deare Couſine, although I haue great hope in the prouidence of your kinſman Amadis, and in the loyall affection which all theſe Knights doe beare me: yet (mee thinkes, reaſon requireth, that I ſhould moſt of all relie on your fidelity, in regard of my bounden dutie to the

King your father, and the Queene your mother, affording me ſuch princely entertainment in Scotland; as alſo for gracing me with the companie of your ſiſter Mabila, of whom onely (next vnto God) I hold my life. For, without the comforts, which ſhe hath many times giuen me

                  Madame, anſwered Agraies, as concerning the good entertainement you receiued in Scotland, the King my father and the Queene, did no more therein then they ought to doe: and ſuch (I am ſure) was their affection towards you: that in all things, which their vnderſtanding could reach vnto, there wanted no loue or kindneſſe in them to you, as their beſt reſpected allie and k

                     fewomen. Now, as concerning my ſiſter and my ſelfe, our actions ſhall daylie make knowne to you, in what vnfeigned reſpect we hold you: deſyring you to beleeue, thet you may command vs, as they that couet nothing more, then your good and honour, preferring them before our owne liues. And whereas you wiſh me, to forget the iniurie, which the King your father hath done, not only to mee, but to all my kinred and friends: aſſure your ſelfe Madame, the wound was made ſo wide and deepe, as it will neuer be healed while I liue. It was no little ingratitude to vs, denying my Lord Amadis, my ſelfe, and many other good Knights, the humble requeſt we made vnto him, to giue the Iſle of Mongaza to mine vnckle Galuanes, who dearely deſerued it, and much more: conſidering, that it was conquered by his

                     our and vertue, that became an humble ſuter for it. Neuertheleſſe, for your loue and honou, I am content to diſſemble my diſtaſte, and deferre (for ſome time) my iuſt occaſion of wiſhing him ill eſpecially, for baniſhing vs from his Court ſo ſtrangely, euen as if we had beene his deadly enemies, and neuer minding or reſpecting, how many great ſeruices we had done for him.
                  
                     
And to let you know, that I will wholly imploy my ſelfe to pleaſe you: I promiſe you Madame, I will eſſay (to my vttermoſt) to doe as you haue deſired me. But it would hardly agree with reaſon, that it ſhould be ouer-raſhly vndertaken, becauſe, if I ſhould bee coole in ſpeech now, matters being altogether diſpoſed for warre: in ſtead of edging the courages of ſo many worthy Knights, as are now met together in this Iſle, I ſhould intimidate the greater part of them, by hearing mee preach of peace, and raiſe in them an apprehenſion, that I vſe ſuch language, as being the man firſt affrighted. Wherein I muſt fall into two euills together, which hereafter will redound to the great dammage of vs all, but eſpecially mine vnrecouerable ſhame. But ſome being ſent to the King your father, and hauing heard his anſwere: I will entreate my worthy friends, to doe according as you haue aduiſed. In the meane while, mee thinkes you ſhould greeue ſo little as poſſibly you may, ſupporting both Time and Fortune, with a womanly, conſtant and inuincible pacience. Couſin (quoth ſhee) I acknowledge it very requiſite, not to daunt their manly ſpirits, that are aſſembled here about my buſineſſe; but rather, to maintaine their height of minde, committing all things to their care and diſcretion.
                  During all this conference, Agrates continually obſerued Olinda, whom he affected with all his heart, as he had made good proofe of, in paſſing (for her loue) vnder the Arch of loyall Louers: notwithſtanding, preferring vertue before his paſſions, hee knew ſo wiſely to cōceale them, that leauing her there ſhut vp with Ortana, hee departed without ſpeaking to her, and neuer frequented the place, albeit it was an inſupportable paine to him.
                  So, at parting from the Princeſſe, hee ſaid: Madame, I will effectually performe what you haue enioyned me. Returne then, ſaid ſhe, and commend mee moſt kindly to the whole companie. The like ſhee did to Floreſtan and Brian, who taking leaue of her, went to ſeeke Amadis and the reſt, who awaited their comming, and declared to them all her anſwere. Whereupon was concluded, that ſome ſhould bee ſent to King Liſuart, ſo ſoone as poſſibly might bee; wherefore Brian and Quedragant were entreated by all the company, to take that charge vpon them, which they could not well refuſe, becauſe the other were ſo importunate.

                     NOW did not Amadis know, what order hee ſhould take concerning Graſinda; either for ſending her home into her owne Countrie, or to determine on her abyding there, vntill this contention were better appeaſed. Wherefore, being deſirous to ſound her owne 
                        •…
                     
                     on, hee went to viſite her in her lodging: and after ſome few other

ſpeeches paſſed betweene them, Amadis thus ſpake vnto her. Madame, I am much diſcontented with my ſelfe, that I haue no better opportunity, of doing you honour, in this place, and giuing you wel-come equall to your deſerts: but time being contrarie to my deſires, robs me of all due occaſion. Therefore I humbly entreate you, that (in excuſing me) you will conceiue no offence, or impute it to any want of good will: for you haue ſo much bound me to you by your paſſed fauours, as I cannot enioy one day of my life, that I may not graunt but to be onely yours, in any ſeruice whatſoeuer I can doe for you. And becauſe it is now a long while, ſince you departed from your Countrie, and (perhaps) this long abode of yours here, may be more diſpleaſing to you, then I could wiſh: I am deſirous, to vnderſtand your owne deliberation, to the end, that I may endeauour all poſſible meanes, to obey you in whatſoeuer you ſhall pleaſe to command me.
                  Lord Amadis, anſwered Graſinda, I might well be reputed poore in iudgement, if I knew not certainely; that both the companie, and fauours you haue done for me hath ſorted to the very higheſt honour, that euer could befall me. As for the good entertainment, which you alleadge to haue receiued in my Country, if it could deſerue the name of goodneſſe: hath it not alreadie beene more then fiue fold recompenced, to your great ſame, and partly my reproach? Neuertheleſſe, to put you out of doubt of my determination; I will boldly diſcloſe my minde vnto you. I ſee ſo many good Knights heere met together, for aſſiſtance of that peereleſſe Princeſſe Oriana, and they wholly relying vpon your vertues, both in hope and perſwaſion of good ſucceſſe, for the loue and high eſteeme they hold you in; it is impoſſible for you to forſake them, but to your eternall blame and infamie. And therefore, ſeeing ſuch a weightie charge is put vpon you, it muſt be your care and labour, to ſend to all coaſts, for recouerie of men to giue you ſuccour: that the honour of ſo great an enterpriſe may remaine to you, by meanes of your good friends, among whom, I account my ſelfe not to bee the leaſt. And that you may haue effectuall proofe, of deeds to make good words: I am reſolued, to diſpatch hence Maiſter Elizabet tomorrow morning, ſending him for Romania, there to muſter vp (both of my ſubiects, and others) ſo many as conueniently he may, and ſhipping them with all ſpeed, to conuay them hither.

                     , beyond all ability of ſatisfaction; that I ſtand meerely as a man confounded, at ſuch extraordinarie loue and kindneſſe. And ſeeing you are ſo free in bounty towards me, I were vnwiſe to refuſe it; but (with all humility) moſt thankefully accept it. And if you pleaſe to require Maſter Elizabet, to paſſe from thence to Conſtantinople with Letters of credence from me to the Emperour: I make

no doubt, but (according to his promiſe heretofore made mee, and hatred he beares to the Emperour of Rome) that he will louingly ſend vs ayde. I am perſwaded, replied Graſinda, that Maiſter Eliſabet will hold himſelfe right happie, in doing you any acceptable ſeruice: for his deſires only ayme thereat, as often times he hath aſſured me. Now Sir, there remaineth nothing elſe, but your entreatie to Oriana, that I may make one in her gracious company. Madame, ſaid Amadis, ſeeing it is ſo well lyking to you, I will preſently ſend to know her minde; and doe verily beleeue, that it will be as pleaſing to her, as to your ſelfe, that you will vouchſafe to keepe her company.
                  Then he called for Gandales, to whom he gaue that charge, and he tarried not long, but returned againe to them, ſaying: That Oriana thanked Graſinda moſt affectionatly, and gaue attendance

                  This done, Amadis conducted her to the Princeſſe, where leauing her: he went to diſpatch away Maſter Eliſabet, to whom he gaue a Letter, directed to the Emperour, the contents whereof follow.

ſuch a ſupply of ſoldiours, as poſſibly ſhee may. Thou maiſt at large acquaint her, with all matters paſt, the condition wherein we now are, and into what daunger we may fall. Moreouer, tell her, and bid her well remember it, that this matter touching me, concerneth her ſelfe as neerely, being hers, as ſhe doth very well know.
                  My Lord, anſwered Tantiles, the Queene my Miſtreſſe will conceiue more delight then you can imagin, that ſhe may compaſſe any meanes to let you know, how deſirous ſhe is to doe any thing worthy your acceptance. And beleeue it aſſuredly, that ſo ſoone as ſhee ſhall heare theſe tydings: ſhe will take ſuch order in the matter you ſend for, as you ſhall quickly ſee me returned with a ſufficient power of men. Deliuer her then (quoth Amadis) this Letter, and make what dilligent ſpeed thou canſt. So he gaue him the Letter, contayning theſe liues.
                  
                     
                        The Letter ſent from Amadis, to Briolania, Queene of Sobradiſa.
                        
                        
                           I Am perſwaded Madame, after you haue heard by Tantiles, Maiſter of your Houſhold, the cauſe that mooues me to ſend to you in ſuch haſte: that you will allow much fauour, to what he ſhall tell you on my behalfe. Aſſure your ſelfe, that in making vſe of your gentle breeding, you will not now ſaile mee: no more then you thinke I ſhould doe, being alwaies readie to ſet foote in ſtirrop for you, where any neceſsitie can offer it ſelfe. And becauſe he hath beene euermore preſent, at all ſuch occurrences as haue happened to me, ſince my returne into this Country, and I haue giuen him charge, to let you know them at large; I will not be troubleſome to you, in reading ouer a tedious long Letter. But earneſtly entreat you, that (crediting him) you will alwaies containe mee in your gracious fauour, whereof I deſire to pertake ſo long as I liue.

                  So Tantiles departed, and without ſoiourning in any place, trauailed ſo deuoutly, that he ſoone arriued in the Kingdome of Sobradiſa. On the otherſide, Gandalin was appointed to goe for Gaule; for which cauſe, Amadis, taking him aſide, thus ſpake to him. Gandalin, thou art he, who alwaies hath beene the guardian of my moſt intimate occaſions, by the loue which our youngeſt yeares bred in vs, euen as if nature had inuited vs to a perfect brother-hood. Thou knoweſt, that my honour is thine, and that thine concerneth mee as much as mine owne. Thou ſeeſt what a buſineſſe is begunne vpon me, of what conſequence it is, and what concluſion is reſolued on, by all the Knights: to imploy our friends and kinred for ſome powerfull ayde, to withſtand the forces of King Liſuart, if he aduenture to ſet vpon vs. And for this cauſe, I haue ſent Meſſengers to diuers Princes, from whom I hope to receiue ſuch bands of men, as ſhall make vp an able Armie.
                  Now, albeit thine abſence will be ſomewhat grieuous to me, yet notwithſtanding, relying more vpon thy diligence, then any other ſeruice now to be done mee: I am determined, to ſend thee to King Perion my father, who of long time hath knowne thee, and to whom (better then any other) thou canſt diſcloſe, of what importance this warre will prooue to mee, if King Liſuart doe begin it. For, as thou

maiſt truely tell him, in part it concerneth him, the ingratefull King hauing done ſo many high disfauours, to all them that are of our linage, excluding them from his Court, after ſuch an infinity of great good ſeruices, by them done to him: what thou knoweſt, ſpare not fully to acquaint him withall, both what thou haſt ſeene, and in what neceſſitie thou didſt leaue vs. And yet neuertheleſſe, boldly ſay vnto him, and aſſure him thereof, in the loyall dutie of a ſonne, that I feare not any power whatſoeuer; hauing right and iuſtice on my ſide, and ſo many worthy Knights to aſſiſt me in my cauſe.
                  Tell him moreouer, Gandalin, that I had neuer attempted ſo great an enterpriſe, had it not beene, that ſeeing God had called mee to the order of Knight-hood, I neuer minded any thing more: but to performe the dutie of a Knight, defending (to my power) the wrongfull diſgraces offred by many, eſpecially to Ladies and Gentlewomen, who ought to bee preferred before all other perſons, and for whom I haue often put my life in perill, without hope of any other recompence from them, then pleaſing God by ſo well a done deed, and augmenting mine owne renowne through the world. And this was the onely cauſe that mooued mee to forſake mine owne Countrie to ſeeke (among ſtrange nations) for ſuch as ſtood in need of my helpe: where I haue met with many perillous aduentures, as thou thy ſelfe haſt ſeene, and can at large recount. Namely, that arriuing in this Iſle, I was aduertiſed, how King Liſuart (forgetting the glory of God, right towards men, councell of his Lords, and the verie naturall inſtinct, which euery good father commonly beareth to his child) would needs, euen in a manner of extreame cruelty, baniſh from his Kingdome, Madame Oriana, his owne daughter and principall heire, to giue her (againſt her will) as wife to the Emperour Patin of Rome, whom ſhe hateth to the death.
                  Hereof ſhee made complaint, not only to them of the Realme of Great Brittaine, but require

And ſo much her prayers and oppreſſions preuailed, that the Lord and ruler of all things, locked on her with a mercifull eye, inſpiring the hearts of many good Knights, to meete here in this place, euen by miracle as it were: where I found them, as thou knoweſt, reſolued to aduenture their liues, for ſetting her at libertie by force, and other Ladies keeping her company. Conſidering, that in doing otherwiſe, they ſhould iuſtly deſerue blame in following times, giuing (many) occaſion to preſume: that cowardiſe only kept them from this commendable ayde, being perſons of ſo great quality as they all are, and the caſe ſo important.

take in good part what wee haue done, and receiue Madame Oriana, with all her attendants, into his fauour againe. And yet wee ſtand reſolued, that if he will not accept our honeſt offer, but proudely deſpiſe it: to ſtand vpon our guarde againſt him, our good friends and kinred backing vs; among whom, Gandalin, thou maiſt aſſure him, that we reckon him as the chiefeſt, and therefore doe humbly entreate him, to helpe vs in ſo reaſonable a neceſſitie. See alſo the Queene my mother, and kiſſe her hand on my behalfe. Pray her, to ſend hither my ſiſter Melicia, to keepe companie with theſe other Ladies, among whom ſhe may learne many ſingular qualities. But before thou goeſt hence, know of my Couſine Mabila, if ſhee will command thee any ſeruice thither: and make ſome means, to ſpeak with the Princeſſe Oriana, who will not ſhew her ſelfe ſo ſtrange to thee; but that thou maiſt perceiue the eſtate of her good health, and how her affection continueth towards me.
                  If Amadis was thus ſeriouſly buſied, about the procuration of good ayde, Agraies ſlept not on the otherſide: for he inſtantly ſent Gandales into Scotland, with expreſſe charge to the King his father, in what need they ſtood of his aſſiſtance. Already Landin was gon for Ireland, by whom Quadragant entreated the Queene his Niece, to ſend ſuch a ſufficient power, as poſſibly ſhe might. And yet not to let King Cildadan, her husband, know thereof: for it was againſt all reaſon, that hee ſhould meddle in the matter, conſidering the couenants and alliances, betweene him and King Liſuart. Moreouer hee had command, to prouide ſo many ſhippes for warre, as he could, and to bring them along with him. Brunco de bonne Mer (who dearely affected Melicia, ſiſter to Amadis) wrote to the Marqueſſe his father, and to Branfill his brother, about the ſame buſmeſſe, and deliuering his Letters to his Squire Laſinde, ſpake in this manner.
                  My honeſt friend Laſinde, thou ſeeſt what a number of Knights are here aſſembled, notwithſtanding, thou muſt conceiue, that the greater part of this buſineſſe, cōcerneth Amadis principally, whom (beſide the vnfeigned loue I beare him) I would gladly ayde to my vttermoſt power, for his ſiſter Meliciaes ſake, to whom I ſtand obliged in ſeruice, and to none other. For ſhould I doe any otherwiſe, I am well aſſured, I ſhould procure his great diſcontentment, which were worſe to me then any death. And therefore thou muſt wiſely perſwade my father, to giue vs his beſt ſuccour: ſhewing him diſcreetly, that this matter is as important to me, as to any other, and yet not vſe one word of Melicia. Onely tell him, my obligation and dutie to Amadis, who hath honoured me with his company in ſo many places, is the onely motiue that commands me: And my brother Branfill ſhall hereby winne more honor, then ſo to ſleepe in the cinders of negligence, as he doth. My Lord (anſwered Laſinde) I hope ſo well to accompliſh your command, that my voyage ſhall haue effect equall to your deſire. And ſo taking leaue, he went away.
                  Nor was Amadis vnmindfull, concerning the offers made him by King Taffinor of Bohemia, at ſuch time as he vndertooke his cauſe in Combate, againſt Garadan, whom he ſlue, and afterward foyled eleuen

other Knights, belonging to the Emperour Patin. Hereupon, conſulting with his owne cogitatiōs, he determined to ſend thither Yſanis, the ancient Gouernour of the Encloſed Iſle: a worthy wiſe Knight, to requeſt ayde of him. And purſuing this purpoſe, he called for the good old man, to whom he ſaid Yſanio, knowing the fidelity remayning in you, and your euerreadie good will to doe mee any ſeruice: I would entreate you, to vndertake a iourney for mee, about a matter of great conſequence, not knowing any Gentleman (beſide your ſelfe) more apt and anſwerable for the buſineſſe. I would haue you goe to King Taffinor of Bohemia, to whom you ſhall beare Letters of credence from mee: giuing him (beſide) to vndeſtand our occaſions, and what truſt wee repoſe in his aſſiſtance. Hee is a Prince magnanimous and bountifull, and (I truſt) will not faile me, hauing formerly made mee ſuch liberall offers. My Lord, anſwered Yſanio, I promiſe you I will doe my duetie. Well then, ſayd Amadis, to morrow morning you ſhall ſet on-ward: but aboue all things (Yſanio

                           SIR, if euer I did any ſeruice, worthie your liking and acceptance, the honourable and kinde entertainement, which I receiued of you and yours, all the while I remained in your Court, hath made me much more readie (ſo long as I liue) to make no ſpare of my perſon, but alwaies to be in due preparation, for your continuall obedience and ſeruice. Wherefore I humbly entreat you, not to imagine, that the ſending of this preſent meſſenger to you, is in expectation of any recompence: but rather, remembring the honeſt offers you made mee at my departure from Bohemia, it drew me on to ſo much boldneſſe, as, by this meanes of ſending to you, earneſtly to deſire you, to giue mee aide in abuſineſſe, which nerely concerneth mee, and wherewith this bearer will further acquaint you. I beſeech you Sir to credit him, euen as my ſelfe, and to command his diſpatch with all poſſible ſpeed: to rid him out of all dread, that is readie to ſacrifice his life for you. And that is Amadis de Gaule, ſirnamed in many places, The Knight of the greene Sworde, euermore by you and yours to be commanded.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. V.
                  
                     Of the priuate talke, which Oriana and Mabila had with Gandalin, and what he gaue Amadis to vnderſtand, concerning them.
                  
                  
                     AMbaſſadours being diſpatched to all parts, as you haue formerly heard, Gandalin, being readie to depart for Gaule: came to the lodgings of the Princeſſe Oriana, according as his Maiſter before had appointed him. And becauſe no man might enter, without command and permiſſion from the Princeſſe, the gate being alwaies kept by one of the auncienteſt

women: he ſent word to Mabila, to know from her, if ſhe pleaſed to write to the Queene her Aunte, or to her Couſine Melicia. Mabila being acquainted by the Gentlewoman, concerning the motion made by Gandalin, went and told Oriana thereof, ſo loude as euery one might heare her, ſaying. Madame, Gandalin is going for Gaule towards King Perion: may it pleaſe you commaund him any thing to the Queene, or to my Couſin? Yes mary will I, anſwered Oriana, cauſe him come in, that I may ſpeake with him. Then Gandalin was addmitted into the Princeſſe Chamber, when ſeeing him, ſhe preſently aroſe, and taking him aſide (as pretending to giue him ſome priuate enſtructions; ſhe beganne to ſigh, and ſpake in this manner.
                  
                     Gandalin, my deare friend, what thinkeſt thou that Fortune is ſo contrarrie to me, bereauing me of the onely man in the world, whoſe company I moſt affect, he being ſo nere me, and I altogether in his power? Neuertheleſſe, we cannot haue the meanes for the leaſt priuate conference, without great taxation to mine honour, whereby my heart endureth ſuch affliction: as, if thou kneweſt it, I am certainely perſwaded, that thou wouldſt take more pittie on me then thou doeſt. And ſo I pray thee tell him, to the end, that though I haue iuſt cauſe to complaine: yet he may reioyce, by the augmentation (dayly more and more) of mine vnfeigned loue and loyaltie to him. And I would haue him deuiſe the meanes, by ſome pretie ſtratagem among his aſſociates; that yet we may ſee one an other, vnder collour of thy voyage, and to comfort me.
                  Madame, anſwered Gandalin, you haue great reaſon to beare him ſuch loyal affection, and to remember alſo ſome remedie, whereto (aboue all things elſe) hee would gladly aſpire: for if you knew the extremitie, wherein I haue ſeene him an hundred times, you might very well beleeue, that loue is a Lordly tyrant ouer him. I haue ſeene him halfe dead (as it were) a thouſand times, thinking on the paſſed fauours you haue affoorded him, and as manie times to recouer life againe, onely by the meere remembrance of them. I haue likewiſe ſeene him (among the deadlieſt dangers in the world) performe ſuch incomparable actions of Armes, calling onely vpon you to be his comfort: that it can hardly bee credited, any Knight ſhould haue ſo much valour in him. Therefore ſweete Madame, I pray you take pittie on him, and vſe him anſwerable to his high deſerts. For this I dare aſſure you, neuer was any Knight more loyall, or more yours, then he is: neither euer had any Lady ſuch power ouer a man, as you haue ouer him; in your hands only lies his life and death, and you may diſpoſe of him as you pleaſe.
                  
                     Gandalin, replied Oriana, I beleeue thee vndoubtedly, feeling in mine owne ſelfe, that which thou relateſt in him, and his life is mine, for I haue no other breathing, but by him, and in the companie of others, he onely makes me liue. But I pray thee, make mee not die, as ſometimes thou didſt, when thou broughteſt me tydings, of his returne from Gaule into Great Brittaine: for, in being depriued now of all meanes, to doe what willingly I would for him, I may doe wrong to him, and to myſelfe alſo, by declaring my deſires ouer-earneſt and affectionate. Therefore, I pray

thee ſpeake no more, but returne to him, and will him to worke ſome way, that I may ſee him ſo ſoone as poſſible he can. So Gandalin tooke his leaue, and as he was parting out of the Chamber, ſhee ſpake ſome-what audibly: faile not to come for my letters, before you goe hence.
                  
                     Amadis attended his returne in ſound deuotion, and no ſooner ſaw him, but ſayd vnto him. Well, Gandalin, haſt thou ſeene my Lady? I pray thee tell mee, what hath ſhe ſaid to thee? Then hee declared (word by word) what had paſſed betweene them, how deſirous ſhe was to ſee him: and (for a finall reſolution) wiſhed him, to come with ſome other of the Knights, vnder collour of comforting her. But when hee came to thoſe words of kindneſſe, which (in the zeale of affection) ſhe had ſpoken: hee ſtood as one entranced, till recouering ſpirit againe, he thus ſpake. Alas, Gandalin, how ſhall I do what thou ſaiſt? Hauing apprehended a conceit ſuddenly, thus hee proceeded. Thou muſt needs goe to Agraies, and tell him, that becauſe I ſend thee into Gaule, thou was deſirous to know of my Couſin Mabila, whether ſhee would write to my ſiſter Melicia, or no. And after ſome few ſpeeches paſt betweene you, ſhe told thee, ſhe held it very conuenient, that we ſhould oftener viſit Madame Oriana, then wee vſe to doe, and make meanes, to cauſe her forget the extreame melancholie, whereto (ouer-much) ſhee addicteth her ſelfe, leaſt, being ſo continually ſad, ſhee fall into ſome dangerous diſeaſe. And be very circumſpect, hee diſcouer not, that thou haſt ſpoken with me, or that I know any thing of this matter. And once more I pray thee tell mee, didſt thou not finde her very ſad?
                  You know well enough Sir, anſwered Gandalin, and for no little length of time, that ſhee is one of the moſt wiſe and vertuous Ladies, as euer was borne, and knowes ſo diſcreetly to diſſemble her paſſions: as the cunningſt cenſure cannot reach them, or gather by her lookes, whether ſhe be inwardly afflicted or no. And yet I am verily perſwaded, that ſhe is too much giuen to melancholie. Heauen affoord mee ſo much fauour (quoth Amadis) for her, that her deſires may ſort to ſome good effect: neuer then ſhall I feare either life or death, or any thing elſe that Fortune can impoſe vpon me. Doubt nothing Sir, replied Gandalin, I hope, that as our Lord hath euer-more preſerued you, and preferred you before any other Knight: hee will not now forget you, and in a time of ſuch vrgent neceſſity. Goe thy way then, ſaid Amadis, to my Couſine, and bring mee newes againe ſo ſoone as thou canſt.
                  So Gandalin departed, and finding Agraies at leiſure, diſcharged his meſſage ſo effectually: that the Prince (imagining all to be true he had ſayd) thus anſwered. Truſt me, my ſiſter ſhewes her ſelfe to be very well aduiſed, and what ſhe requires, ſhall bee done. And although her viſitation hath hitherto beene deferred; it was for no other reaſon, but in feare of diſcontenting Madame Oriana. Wherefore, I will confer hereon with the companie, whom I ſhall finde (I make no doubt) as readie as my ſelfe to obey her. So, without any further tarrying, he went to Lord Amadis, to whom hee declared all that Gandalin had told him, as from his ſiſter. Amadis appearing, as if hee had neuer heard

thereof, replied, that he referred to him and the reſt, whatſoeuer they thought fit to be done in this caſe. Whereupon, Agraies imparted it to them all, yet without any notice, that it proceeded from the opinion of Mabila: but rather from an apprehenſion in himſelfe, as accounting it very conuenient, to goe comfort the Princeſſe Oriana, whom Gandalin found to bee mightily ouer-come with melancholy.
                  And beleeue it (quoth hee) if in ſuch extremities, the ſtrongeſt and moſt magnanimous ſpirits ſtand in neede of conſolation: by much more reaſon then, doth the weake conſtitution of young Ladies command it, who beeing feeble of themſelues, ſhould therefore the oftner be viſited and comforted. Hereunto all the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle condiſcended, and (for a beginning) the very ſame day they ſent to the Princeſſe, to knowe if ſhe would allow thereof, or no: And ſhe returned them anſwere, that they ſhould be moſt reſpectiuely welcome. Whereupon they preſently went thither, and as they fell from one diſcourſe to another, Quedragant and Brian ſaid. Madame, if you pleaſe to cōmand any thing to the King your father, or to your mother the Queen, wee are appointed from this companie, to depart for Great Brittaine about your buſineſſe.
                  Now was Amadis withdrawn aſide with Mabila, while Agraies cōferred with Olinda, and Floreſtan, and Angriote with Graſinda. And well we may conceiue, that Amadis was in a ſtrange perplexity, ſeeing her ſo neare him, whom hee loued aboue all creatures in the world, and yet hee durſt not ſo much as ſpeake to her: but regarded her with a ſtedfaſt eye, whereto her eye alſo ſeemed to make anſwere, euen as if an imparlance had paſſed between them, which made his words to Mabila, to ſauour of idle and fond imperfection. But ſhee, well knowing the Saint of his deuotion; to cure him of his ouer-awing fit: bethought herſelfe of the moſt honeſt meanes that could be, both to quicken him, and recouer ſome ſpirit likewiſe in Oriana, ſaying ſoddenly, Madame, you promiſed Gandalin yeſter day, that you would write to Queene Eliſena, and to Melicia, and (for ought I heare to the contrary) he is preſently to depart, and you haue forgot your letters.
                  
                     Oriana, who vnderſtood well enough at what marke ſhee aymed, anſwered: Let him come hither, and by word of mouth, I will as well ſatisfie him, as if I had troubled him with my Letters. Then one of the Damoſels aroſe, and going foorth of the Chamber, called for Gandalin, who preſently entred with her. Well had hee beene inſtructed by Amadis, concerning what hee was to doe, if the Princeſſe would ſpeake with him before this company: wherefore beeing come where ſhe was, hee made her an humble reuerence, and then to his Maſter, who talked all this while (as I formerly told you) with Mabila. It was not long, before Oriana (who ſate between Quedragant and Brian) aroſe, and taking Brian by the hand, ſaid to him. I pray you Coſen, to witneſſe with mee, what meſſage I ſhall ſend by Gandalin, to the Queene of Gaule and her daughter Melicia: to the end, that you may report it to the King my father, if hee inquire any ſuch matter of you. In the meane while, Lord Quedragant (if ſo hee

be pleaſed) ſhall abide with the Queene Sardimira, who knowes well enough how to entertaine him.
                  But Brian, who was one of the moſt gentle and courteous Knights liuing: would not follow her, but, with an amiable ſmile, thus anſwered. Madame, you muſt pardon me, for, beeing appointed (as I haue told you) to goe to the King about your buſineſſe: my friends heere may grow ſuſpitious of me, and ſtand in doubt, that I may be ſo ſubborned by your gracious ſpeech, as I ſhall ſhew my ſelfe more milde and tractable to him, then conſiſts in my commiſſion, and the charge I haue receiued from them. Nay Sir, replied Oriana, heare but the reaſon, why I would haue you acquainted with this meſſage. It is to no other end, but by hearing mine owne tongue to relate my hearts tribulations (wich I deſire ſhould bee knowen, not onely in Great Brittaine, but likewiſe in all countries of the world:) you would bee the more indulgent, to mediate my peace, and to deliuer al theſe Ladies from impriſonment. And if you were affected to any one amongſt them; her vertue might preuaile againſt any ſterne deliberation.
                  
                     Oriana deliuered theſe wordes with ſuch a gracious demeanour, as they all tooke delight to heare & and behold her. Eſpecially Brian, who although he was young, faire, and of goodly forme: yet was hee more addicted to follow Armes, then loue; and fewe Knights were more actiue then hee, to handle his launce and ſword, for the defence of iniured Ladies, whenſoeuer they ſtood in need of his help. Whereby hee became a friend to all in generall, and did them infinite particular ſeruices, which being deſirous that Oriana ſhould take knowledge of, (thus hee anſwered.
                  By my faith Madame, you may eſteeme of mee as you pleaſe, but if I ſhould long tarrie in ſo good company: I greatly feare, I ſhould ſoone loſe that, which I haue alwaies held as mine owne, ſince firſt I had knowledge of my ſelfe. Therefore, I had need to get me further off, and leaue my roome to Lord Amadis, & your Coſen: they may ſerue you for witneſſes, if they be ſo pl

                  But now, ſeeing opportunity ſo graciouſly fauour him, as he might freely ſpeake what hee vvould hee was ſo vtterly loſt in ioy, that

                  But Oriana, laying her right hand vpon his arme, caught holde vvith her other vpon his hand, & locking it faſt in hers (to teſtifie the vigour of her affection) ſaid: Deer friend, though no greater happineſſe in this vvorld can befall mee, then continually to enioy your

                  Now truſt me Sir, ſaid Oriana, I am not a little amazed, that you, hauing ſuch aſſurance of the vnfained loue I beare you, ſhould now ſeeme doubtfull thereof: doe you imagine, that I deſire not your eaſe as much as mine owne? Before God I ſpeake it, I haue no pleaſure but by you, neither any eaſe but to ſee you ſatisfied. But, conſider the tumultuous eſtate wherein we are, and that if we were (neuer ſo little) diſcouered, it would bee to the vtter ruine of vs both. So many eyes obſerue our behauiour here, as neuer did the like, when wee were in company with the Queen my mother. And here our actions are ſo narrowly purſued, as (without exterme danger) no ſuch aduenture may be made as you ſpeake of. Excuſe me therefore I entreat you, & let this remain for your ſettled contentment, that I am ſo faithfully yours, as both my oath and promiſe haue ſtrictly bound me. Madame, anſwered Amadis I will practiſe how I may beſt pleaſe you, and to bring my thoughts to your obedience: albeit I much miſdoubt, that this compulſion will hardly holde out, if it be not the better backt by your fauour, from which it appeareth you ſeek to exclude me, without offending either in worde or thought, and that I dare maintaine on the perill of my ſoule
                  With theſe wordes, the teares guſhed out of his eyes, where at Oriana grieuing, ſaid. Exclude my beſt comfort! Sooner let me die ten thouſand deaths. I know the truth of your loyaltie, and can deſire no better teſtimony thereof, then the iuſt apprehenſion of mine owne conſcience. And take not in ill part what I haue ſaid to you, for the feare of your ſo long abſence from me, as in theſe lauer yeares you

haue beene, was the onely motiue of this language. What more advantage then can you require of me? Let the King my father make peace or warre with you, he can make me neither leſſe nor more yours, then reſolvedly I am.
                  As ſhee would haue continued on theſe ſpeeches, Mabila, who ſerved to thē but as a ſhadow, perceiving many eyes fixed vpon them, ſpake thus cloſely. Enough for this time, every eye notes you. Sweet friend (quoth Oriana) dry vp your teares, and ſit by your Couſin, who will tell you ſome things, that yet you never heard of, and wherein I thinke) you will take a little delight. So ſhe left them together, returning againe to the Queene Sardamira and Brian. In which time, Mabila told him at large, how Eſplandian was borne, and by what miſhap he was loſt in the Forreſt, as Durin and the Damſoll of Denmarke carried him to Nurſe. And laſt,

                     Amadis heere at was to ioyfull, as no man could be more, and anſwered Mibila thus. Beleeue me Coſin, I was continually full of doubt, for at my returne from Conſtantinople, by chance, I met with Angriote d'Eſtre

                      whereby you gaue me to vnderſtand, that my lynage was encreaſed, yet durſt I not preſume in what manner. But now (heaven be praiſed) we are both well aſſured, and better ſatisfied then ever before, eſpecially my ſelfe more contented, then if I had conquered the greater part of the world: not only for being father to Eſplandian, but becauſe I begot him on her, whom fortune hath preferred before all other, both in vertue, beauty, and all other good graces. Yet haue I ſuffered ſo much for her ſake, as if I were able, to expreſs but only a half part of thoſe cares, that kept mee company during her abſenc, your ſelfe would complaine much more then I haue done.
                  Here, fetching a deepe ſigh, hee breathed a while, and afterward thus went on. But fortune made me a moſt honorable recompence, ſending mee in ſuch a convenient ſeaſon, to deliver her from her enemies hand: for, if it had falne out otherwiſe queſtionleſſe it had beene the death of vs both. But that which now doth moſt offend me, onely is feare of her ſickneſſe, by her conti

with the Emperour be quite broken off, otherwiſe, we are reſolved, never to deliver her: Meane while, we haue diſpatched Ambaſſadours to all parts, to procure aid and ſuccour among our friends, to the end: that if he refuſe our honeſt offer, and will needs enter the field againſt vs, wee may bee able (like good men) to make him anſwer.
                  Coſin, anſwered Mabila, I will do all that I can for you, and never credite me, but Madame Oriana doth highly applaud this her good fortune: aſſuring you, that we all endured ſuch greivance by her in your abſence, but eſpecially, when ſhe heard of her intended marriage to the Emperour, as you would haue ſtood amazed, to behold the ſorrowes which I haue ſeene her ſuffer. But becauſe you vnderſtand ſufficiently, both the reaſon of the cauſe, and what iuſt right you haue in her, I will looſe no more time, to remember you of that which needs not. Let it ſuffice you, that you haue brought her ſo farre into loues extremitie, as poſſibly more cannot be.
                  Now, in regard that the houre was come for Quedragant and the reſt to depart thence, and had-already taken leaue of Oriana▪ Amadis and Mabila gaue over talking. So the Knights went forth of the chamber, & giuing the goodnight to the Ladies, returned to their owne lodgings. Where now (for a while) we meane to leaue them, to the end that wee may tell you, how King Liſuart came acquainted with the death of the Prince Saluſte Quide, and ouerhrowe of the Emperours men.

                      came & told him, that the 
                        〈◊〉
                      was very ill, through griefe and ſorrow mightily ſeazing on her. Hereupon, hee went to ſee her, where not finding his daughter, nor the other Ladies and Gentlewomen, that vſually kept her company: his ſecret conceit of griefe began more plainely to expreſſe it ſelfe, ſo that the tears trickled downe his reuerend beard.
                  No ſooner was hee entred the Chamber, but the Queene beholding him, fell downe in a ſwoone: yet hauing good helpe about her, quickly ſhe came to her ſelfe again. Then the King embraced her in his armes, and to comfort her, ſpake in this manner. Madame, I was perſwaded, that your vertue and

wiſedome would preuaile againſt this womaniſh weakeneſſe: eſpecially, thoſe matters (about which you thus afflict your ſelfe) being brought to ſo good an end, that our daughter may iuſtly ſtile her ſelfe, one of the greateſt Princeſſe in all Europe. Wherefore I pray you be better comforted, and if you will not doe it for your owne ſake: yet let it be done for mine, otherwiſe, you will giue mee occaſion to miſconſter worſe than I doe. The Queen, well vnderſtanding all that hee ſaide, would expreſſe no outward appearance thereof, but ſighed without any intermiſſion: which mooued the King to ſuch compaſſion, as he could not refraine from weeping. But becauſe hee would not be noted hee went downe into the garden, where he walked ſadly alone by himſelfe: till ſuch time as King Arban came vnto him, who not ſeeming to perceiue the Kings ſorrow, ſaid. Sir, your huntſmen willed mee to tell you, that they haue found (in this neare neighbouring Forreſt) the greateſt Hart that euer was ſeene: may it pleaſe you (to morrowe) to goe ſee the paſtime? yes, with all my heart anſwered the King.
                  As thus they continued talking, diuerſe Knights came thither, who to alter him from his melancholie diſpoſition: fell into diuerſitie of diſcourſe, ſome of hunting, others of hawking, ſo that all the reſt of the day, they talked of nothing elſe. But the next morning, as they were readie to mount on horſeback, fortune, who is ſeldome ſatisfied with any paſſed misfortunes, brought a new occaſion of much greater ſorrowe. For, ſome of the Romanes which had eſcaped from the priſons in the Encloſed Iſle: preſented themſelues before the King, in very ſory and baſe garments, declaring at large all their diſaſter, his daughters ſurpriſal, & death of the Prince Saluſte Quide.
                  
                  You may now imagine, whether theſe bad tidings amazed him, or no, notwithſtanding, declaring conſtancie, & vnconquerable wiſdome: hee made ſhew of little or no diſtaſte at all, but anſwered, as if the matter concerned him a great way off. Friends (quoth hee) I am ſorrie for the death of the Prince Saluſte Quide, and the miſhap befallen to you: but for the wrong done mee by them of the Encloſed Iſle, I haue been vſed to receiue (& oftentimes to returne alſo) the like Alarums, knowing well enough how to reuenge greater iniuries. Be of good cheere, and at my returne from hunting, I will further conſider on your buſineſſe. Then calling for one of the maſters of the houſe-holde, hee commanded them to giue them good entertainement.
                  Away rode King Liſuart and his traine, declaring a iocond ſpirit all the way, euen till hee was well entred into the Forreſt: where he continued three whole daies, pulling downe many a goodly Deare. On the fourth day, he returned to the citie, and comming to the Queens lodgings, ſhewed himſelfe much more cheerefull, then euer hee was ſince his daughters departure. So ſoone as hee was entred his Chamber, hee commanded euery one to auoide: and ſitting downe in a chaire by her, thus he began. Madame, in matters of ſlender conſequence, which enſue by accident, men may haue ſome cauſe, to expreſſe paſſion and melancholy: but as they proceede from 
                        •…
                     iall grounds, ſo ought they to bee forgotte with as 
                        〈◊〉
                      remedie. But when a man ſhall bee offended by

ſome one, not only in his perſon and goods, but in his honour and reputation: then it agrees with good reaſon, not only to declare paſſion and melancholie, but alſo to practice all meanes of prouiſion, to take vengeance on him that committed the offence, and to let the world vnderſtand beſide, how highly the greatneſſe of the caſe hath mooued him to impatience.
                  I ſpeake not this to you without cauſe: you haue declared a ſorrow too apparant, for the abſence of your daughter, according to the naturall inclination of mothers: and yet notwithſtanding, I ſhould account my ſelfe happy, by a conceiued hope, of ſoone forgetting ſuch griefe. But in the tayle (as we vſe to ſay) is the venomous ſting hidden, and the end of actions doe approue their good, or euill: and therefore I muſt tell you, that ſuch an iniury hath lately been done me, and toucheth me ſo neare, as I ſhall neuer take reſt, till I haue ſatisfactiō anſwerable to my deſire. The Romans that had the conducting of your daughter, are diſcomfited, the Prince Saluſte Quide ſlaine, Oriana, and all the other Ladies in her company, taken priſoners, by the knights of the Encloſed Iſle: who imagine themſelues not meanely happy by ſuch a victorie, hauing done (as they thinke) more than euer any men did in great Brittaine. And becauſe the ſame thereof will ſoone ſpread it ſelf thorow the world, it is very requiſite, that you ſhould diſſemble ſorrow, and vſe more prudence than paſſion. In ſo doing, you ſhall remaine highly commended, our enemies daunted, and I extraordinarily contented, hoping to prouide ſo well in this caſe, as your honour and mine ſhall be ſufficiently defended.
                  When the Queene had heard theſe newes, ſhe ſate very penſiue, not ſpeaking a word. And as ſhee was one of the wiſeſt, and beſt aduiſed Ladies in the world, & dearly louing to her husband: ſo could ſhe ſuddenly conſider, that it was more neceſſarie, to procure peace betweene the King, and the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, then to ſharpen his fierce ſpleen againſt them, theirs being alſo as hotte towards him, whereupon ſhe returned him this anſwer.
                  My Lord, you haue conceited (as beſt pleaſed your ſelfe) of my inward affliction, for the ſeparation of me and my daughter. But as concerning the fauour done her by the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, if you doe but well conſider the time, when you were a Knight errant, like vnto them, and what you your ſelfe haue done in the like caſes: you would gently excuſe them, in the greater part of their enterpriſe. Doe you thinke, that hauing heard the lamentable moanes ſhe made, euen commonly noiſed in euery countrie, how (in meere deſpight of her) you would marry her to the Emperour: that this would not mooue them to lend her ayde? No man better than your ſelfe doth know, that nothing is more commended by God and man, then helpe and ſuccour giuen to wronged Ladies, eſpecially when it is ſo vrgently required: by very ſtrong reaſon then, ought they to afforde it your daughter, whom they haue knowne and well thought on ſo long a time. Beleeue it my Lord, they can receiue no ſhame by the deed, and your ſelfe will confeſſe in the end, that their attempt ſhold not bee diſpleaſing to you: they preſuming (it may be) that you haue

beene greatly importuned to this marriage, and yeelded thereto againſt your liking.
                  I well perceiue (quoth the King) that you are not much offended with the matter, but rather you can both like and allow thereof: but I ſweare by God, I will make them dearely repent it. So, riſing in a great rage, hee flung out of the chamber, & entring into his owne, ſound there King Arban, Grumedan, and Guillan le Penſif, who went not from him, till hee had tolde them all the conference betweene him and the Queene, and what an anſwere ſhe made him. Now, becauſe they ſaw him much incenſed, they thought good, to conceale what the meant to ſay, and mildely (by little & little) brake off theſe ſpeeches. But it chanced on the morrowe following, that as the Queene came from hearing Maſſe, Durin, brother to the damoſell of Denmarke, fell on his knee before her, and preſented her a Letter, which Oriana had written to her, as followeth.

Neuertheleſſe, not ſo ſatisfied, I was burried by ſuch a tempeſt, that the Romans (which conducted mee) beeing ouercome: wee were brought to the Encloſed Iſle, by them, who (knowing the wrong done vnto vs) hazarded their liues, to ſtay our paſſage any further. And becauſe I ſtand in doubt, that ſuch a matter will not be pacified betweene my father and them, without great effuſion of blood, except you Madame, haue ſome reſpect thereto: I thought fit to ſend this bearer to you, entreating you (for the honor of God) to take compaſsion on your poore deſolate daughter, and worke ſo much with the King, that I may returne againe to him, and reobtaine his

For the reſt, to tell you, how they (in whoſe power I am and the Ladies with me) are minded: they haue ſent Ambaſſadours to my father, as well to knowe, how hee likes their ſuccour giuen mee, as alſo, to mediate his pittie towards mee. Herein Madame, according as I haue giuen charge to Durin, hee will further inſtruct you at his arriuall, and lend a helping hand, to plant peace (if you can) to ſuch a dangerous warre begun by misfortune; for her ſake, who remaineth:
                        
                        
                           Your moſt humble and obedient Daughter, Oriana.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
After the Queene had aduiſedly read, and re-read ouer this Letter, but not without teares: ſhee ſaid to Durin, that ſhee would ſpeake with the King, and afterwards giue him an anſwere. And as ſhee was enquiring of him, what entertainement Oriana and her company had in the Encloſed Iſle: the King came, whom ſhee withdrawing into her Cabinet, & caſting her ſelfe downe at his feet, weeping bitterly, ſhee thus ſpake to him. Alas Sir, for the honour of God take compaſſion on your daughter, and read (if you pleaſe) this Letter which ſhe hath ſent me. The King ſeeing the Queen ſo drowned in teares, tooke her vp from the ground, and receiuing the Letter from her, read the contents thereof: then to appeaſe the extreamitie of her paſſions, hee thus anſwered, Madame, the Ambaſſadours will ſoone be here, that are ſent from thence, haue patience till I haue heard them ſpeake. They may (perhaps) giue me ſuch ſatiſfaction, as the iniurie which I haue receiued will bee forgotten: And they may bring ſuch a meſſage, as I will rather conſent to mine owne ruine, and deſolation of all mine eſtates, than to peace. Much better doe I affect to die with honour, poore and diſinherited; than to liue amighty King, miſerably wretched & faint-hearted, clowded with the teares of you and your daughter. Wherefore, ſpeake no more hereof to me, except you purpoſe to offend me; And ſo leauing her, hee departed out of the chamber.
                  Afterward, ſhe called for Durin, and ſaid vnto him. Friend Durin, returne to my daughter Oriana, and tell her, that I can ſend her no anſwere, vntill the Ambaſſadors ſhal be arriued here, for the King (till then) knowes not how to determine on his buſineſſe. But aſſure her, I will eſſay all poſſible meanes, to do what ſhe hath deſired me. And ſay, I entreate her, alwaies to fixe her owne honour before her eyes, without which, I ſhall deſire her death. Bid her remember, that a wiſe and diſcreet ſoule, is beſt diſcerned in aduerſitie, and not in the flattering times of proſperity. And ſeeing our Lord hath ſuffered her, to bee borne a Princeſſe, and the daughter of ſo great a King; reaſon doth require, that vertue ſhould bee more familier with her, than with a body of baſer condition, in all aduerſities (whatſoeuer) that can happen to her. Alwaies committing the managing of her chiefeſt affaires to God: whom I hartily pray to bleſſe her, & preſerue her in his 
                        •
                     aſe protection, vntill ſuch time as we ſhall meet againe together.
                  
                     Durin being thus diſpatched by the Queene, tooke his way towards the Encloſed Iſle, and ſome few daies after his departure, as the King was ſitting downe to dinner in the great Hall: an Eſquire ſuddenly entred, who gaue him a Letter of credence, which when hee had read, hee demanded of the Squire, of whence, and what hee was. Sir, anſwered the Squire, I am ſeruant to Quedragant of Ireland, who hath ſent me to you about ſuch a buſineſſe, as I will relate, if you pleaſe to heare mee. Honeſt friend, ſaid the King, ſpeak your pleaſure. S
                        •…
                      (quoth the Squire) my Maſter, & Brian de Moniaſte, being ſent from the Encloſed Iſle, are landed in your countrie, to acquaint you with ſome eſpeciall matters, from Lord Amadis de Gaul, and other Knights that are in his company, But before they paſſe any further, or come neare your Court, they ſend you word by mee (vnder your gracious fauor) that

they require ſafe conduct for their comming. Otherwiſe, they are determined, to publiſh their meſſage in all parts of your Land, and in other kingdomes beſide, before they make returne to them that ſent thē. Wherefore Sir, aduiſe your ſelfe, and ſend them your intention.
                  Well knewe the King whereat the meſſage aymed, and therefore he thought it not conuenient, that they ſhould proclaime their cauſe thorough his kingdome, a matter not to be done, but to his high diſhonour. Conſidering, all Ambaſſadours ought to haue ſecurity, as being a caſe ſacred and inuiolable, and the Prince that ſhould offer them iniurie, were farre vnworthy the name and office hee beares: wherefore very graciouſly, thus he anſwered the Squire. My friend, ſay to them that ſent you hither, they may ſafely come to my Court, and I will gladly heare their meſſage to me. The Squire hauing this anſwere, returned preſently to his Maſter, who (with Brian de Moniaſte, being aduertiſed of the Kings minde) forthwith went a ſhoare, & iourneyed ſo expeditiouſly, that on the third day following, they arriued at King Liſuarts Court, before whom they preſented them-ſelues, as hee was newly riſen from dinner.
                  He knew them ſo ſoone as he beheld them, being men whom he had often ſeen, wherefore he welcomed them graciouſly: and all preſſed about the King, to heare their embaſſie, when Quedragant, ſetting his knee to the ground, beganne thus. Sir it is a very laudable vertue, & worthie the higheſt commendations among Kings and Princes, patiently to heare and vnderſtand, ſuch matters as ſtrange Ambaſſadours haue in charge to deliuer them, being wholly diſpoſſeſſed of paſſion: becauſe, if the Embaſſie fall out to their contentment, they will receiue the more ioy thereby, and the Ambaſſadours ſhall be the better fauoured and entertained. Contrariwiſe, if they ſpeake matters diſpleaſing to them, yet ſo to palliate and conceale their anger: that their anſwere may come graciouſly from them, in regard of the condition and office they beare.
                  At theſe words he aroſe, and ſitting downe by his fellow before the King, proceeded thus. Sir, I pray you pardon mee, that I haue vſed this induction to you, which I ſweare vpon my faith was not done, in any doubt of the aſſurance you pleaſed to grant vs: but in due and iuſt commendation, of the vertue of ſo good a Prince, that ſo freely gaue vs entrance into his kingdome.
                  Now Sir, the occaſion of our comming to your Maieſtic, is, by command of the beſt Knight that euer yet was knowne, Amadis de Gaule, and generally, on the behalfe of all them, that are with him in the Encloſed Iſle, who thus (by vs) acquaint you with their minds. Trauerſing ſtarnge & far remote coūtries, in ſearch of aduentures, according as all other Knights errant vſe to doe, eſpecially to ſuccour the weak & diſtreſſed, whan outrage (againſt all reaſon) is offered them: they were aduertiſed by many, that you Sir, being guided by a light and inordinate will, rather then vpright iuſtice and equity, was deſirous (contrary to the counſell of all your beſt friends) to diſinherit (with the greateſt ſhame in the world) Madame Oriana, your eldeſt daughter, & giue her as wife (againſt her will) to the Emperour Patin. So that, neither taking compaſſion on her,

nor her inceſſant teares & moanes, much leſſe regarding the end of ſuch an enterpriſe, and manifeſt diſlike of all your ſubiects: you violently deliuered her to them, that had no reaſon to requeſt her of you.
                  And becauſe ſuch matters of fact and iniuſtice, are not only diſpleaſing to God, but to all ſuch as heare thereof: it pleaſed the hand of heauen, to make vs inſtruments of redreſſe in ſuch a deepe neceſity, and that the Romanes, who had the conduct of her and the other Ladies, ſhould fall into our hands, and ſtanding on their defence againſt vs, bee vanquiſhed, ſome 
                        ••
                     aine, and others taken priſoners. Now Sir, for her and the Ladies, I muſt tell you, that (at this inſtant) they are in the Encloſed Iſle, with a good and ſufficient company of Knights, determined to honour them ſo much as they poſſible may. For their intent neuer was to offend you, or them: but to maintaine equitie, and keep them from force or violence, according as your ſelfe (ſometime) made them ſweare at Vindoliſore.
                  
                  Let mee therefore entreate you, that preferring vertue and reaſon, before choller and paſſion, you would be pleaſed, to receiue home againe your daughter Oriana, and hereafter to entreate her, not as a ſtranger, but as a father ſhould his childe, without ſending her farre from you, or your countrie: where-of, if God be ſo pleaſed, ſhee is to be Lady and Queene after you. If you thinke your ſelfe iniured, and will not grant to their requeſt: that yet you would not deny her your gracious fauour, but accepting her into your Court, as ſhe was wont to bee; to take ſuch reuenge on them afterwards (if you thinke it meet) as you can. For thus much Sir, I muſt aſſure you, that if you purpoſe to aſſayle them; they will defend themſelues as beſt they may. Be therefore well aduiſed on your anſwere, for in your hands you haue both warre and peace.
                  The King, being mightily inſenſed, thus replyed. Gentlemen, becauſe vertue doth ſeldome keepe company, with temerarious Orations, nor audacious anſwers, both the one and the other beeing farre inſufficient, to whet on or animate cowardly mindes: I will not holde you with any long delay, or vſe many words, when few may ſuffice. But my patience being greater towards you, than it needs to be, let mee tell you, that this attempt done by them of the Encloſed Iſle: I know to bee executed more vpon preſumption, than any magnanimitie of courage, 
                        •…
                     ſtanding 
                        〈◊〉
                      the braue wordes by you deliuered. So that what height of honour you imagine to be wonne thereby: any man of good iudgement and diſcretion, will rather check and fouly condemne it. For, it is a matter of no great difficultie, to put in diſorder, or to ouercome ſuch perſons, as trauaile by Land or Sea without all dread or ſuſpition, eſpecially, when men repute themſelues to be among their friends. As for your propoſed remonſtrance, for recalling home my daughter Oriana, and neuer more to ſend her farre from mee: this is no matter, whereof I am not to yeelde any account to you, but to God only, who (next to himſelfe) hath conſtituted me Soueraigne in this kingdome, to gouerne both it and the people. Therfore I doe not meane, to allowe o
                        •
                      any peace with them, vntill they haue made due reparation, of the iniurie I haue receiued by them:

then I will conſider on their motion, and not before.
                  Sir, ſaid Brian, wee haue no further commiſſion to you, or to enquire after any other buſineſſe; what elſe is to bee done, let each ſide conſider thereon as they think good. But God only knoweth the occaſion, that made vs enterpriſe what wee haue done, for the fredome of your vertuous daughter: and vpon that point wee reſt, and craue leaue for our departure. Go in Gods name, ſaid the King. Thus were the Ambaſſadours diſpacht, Grumedan bringing them aboue a mile out of the Citie, ſayde vnto them. Before God Gentlemen, I am much grieued at this new diſaſter, I alwaies did hope, to ſee you (one day) as welcome againe to this Court, as euer you haue been: but now I am verily perſwaded, that our long expected peace will come too late (except our Lord helpe it) conſidering the minde of Amadis. Nor did I imagine him to bee in the Encloſed Iſle, becauſe we heard newes, that hee was vtterly loſt foure yeares agoe: and now it amazeth mee not a little, that he ſhould be ſo ſuddenly found again, and giue ſuch ſuccour to Madame Oriana.
                  
                  Lord Grumedan, anſwered Brian, the King (it may be) will know in time, both what we are, and what ſeruices we haue done him: And if he attempt any thing againſt vs, hee will finde the iſſue to be more ſharp and ſower, than the entrance was pleaſing or delightſome. As for Lord Amadis, you ſawe him not long ſince in this Court, when hee conquered the Crowne from the Romans, that maintained the beauty of the maides of Great Brittaine, to bee more excellent than the Ladies that came with him. Saint Mary! ſaid Grumedan, what doe you tell me? Is it poſſible, that Amadis was the Greek Knight? Beleeue it, anſwered Brian, it was he, and none other. By my ſoule, ſaid Grumedan, I now well perceiue, that I am a man of very poore iudgment, ſeeing I might then haue wel aſſured my ſelfe, that it was hard for any man to doe what he did; I may doubt whether I haue eyes & vnderſtanding. But faire Sir, ſeeing you haue already done ſo much for me, let mee further entreate you to tell mee: who they were that lent aſſiſtance on my day of Combat? Who? anſwered Brian, ſmiling, why two of your very deareſt friends: Angriote d' Eſtrauaus, and Brunco de bonne Mer. In good ſadneſſe (quoth Grumedan) if I had knowne them, I ſhould haue warranted my victorie more certaine than I did: and am well content to confeſſe now, that the honour of the day is more iuſtly due to them, than to me, and all my life time, I am a friend and ſeruant to Amadis, and to you likewiſe, mine honour reſerued.
                  As thus they rode on deuiſing together, they met with Eſplandian, newly returned from hawking, with Ambor, ſonne to Angriote d' Eſtra: uaus, carrying a Spar-hawke on his fiſt: and comming ſomewhat neare them, Brian de Moniaſte, demanded what he was. This is (anſwered Grumedan) the young Gentleman Eſplandian, of whom the wiſe Vrganda hath ſpoken ſo many maruailes. I haue heard of him, ſayd Brian, heretofore. I pray you cauſe him to ſtay a while, that wee may the better beholde him. Which Grumedan did, for, as hee was paſſing by them, hee called to him, ſaying. Come hither Sir, ſee heere the friends of the Greeke Knight, who

(at your requeſt) pardoned the Emperours Knights: at leaſt wiſe, ſend him ſome commendations, from your ſelfe. My Lord, anſwered Eſplandian, I humbly entreate them to pardon me, I knew them not: but for my loue to that good Knight, I would gladly haue the meanes to doe him any ſeruice, and if they pleaſe to kiſſe his hand on my behalfe, they ſhall binde me to them all my life time.
                  Faire Sir, ſaide Brian, that office ſhall be mine, and I will doe it with a glad ſoule: albeit hee hath changed his name ſince you laſt ſaw him, for now hee is called Amadis de Gaule: Amadis de Gaule anſwered Eſplandian, ſurely I cannot think it, becauſe I heard that he was dead: whereat I conceiued no little grief, for the renowned proweſſe reported to be in him. It is he doubtleſſe, ſaid Quedragant. Then Sir I dare aſſure you. replied Eſplandian, I am not ſo forie for the loſſe of my hawke this day (though I loued her dearely) as I am ioyfull to heare what you haue tolde me: becauſe, if I may liue to grow great, I will begge ſo earneſtly of the Queene, that ſhe ſhall not deny mee to goe ſee him, and to receiue my Knight-hood from his hand, if hee ſhall pleaſe ſo much to honor me. Sweet youth, ſaid Brian, God bleſſe and proſper you. And ſo they tooke leaue each of other: Brian and Quedragant following their way to the Encloſed Iſle, and Grumedan and Eſplandian returning to the Court.
               
               
                  CHAP. VIII.
                  
                     How King Liſuart called a Councell, concerning what hee intended to do againſt the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle. And what reſolution was agreed vpon.
                  
                  
                     After that Quedragant & Brian were departed from the Court, King Liſuart found himſelfe wonderfully diſcōtented, ſeeing ſuch weightie occaſions to grow more and more vpon him: he intended on the morrow to call a Councell, only of Arban, King of Norwales, Grum den, and Guillan le Penſit; who being mette together, the King beganne in this manner. Honourable friends, you know what iniurie I haue receiued by the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, and what ſhame I ſhould do to my ſelfe, in ſuffering them to paſſe vnpuniſhed. Neuertheleſſe, not to ſhunne the way which all Princes ſhould take, doing nothing without counſell and deliberation: I would firſt bee aduiſed by you, in what manner I ſhould ſhape my reuenge, that hereafter they may remain an example to ſuch as dare enter into the like attempts againſt mee. Full well you knowe, how dangerous it is to vſe delay in ſuch actions, and of what conſequence my occaſion is: therefore I pray you, let vs conſider together on ſome redreſſe, and euery man freely ſpeake his minde.
                  
                     Arban King of Norwales, was the firſt that anſwered, ſpeaking thus. Sir, ſeeing you are reſolued to make warre againſt Amadis and thoſe of his league, accounting it vnmeete, to accept the offer made you by them: it is expedient to conſider,

that the managing of the matter may bee ſo ordered, as the glory muſt remaine to you. For although we holde it vndoubtedly, that victorie conſiſteth in the hand of heauen onely, God giuing it when, where, and how hee pleaſeth, and commonly, agreeing with the iuſtice of the cauſe: yet diligent prouidence is not to bee neglected, in all ſuch caſes, as are required, before any enterpriſe be attempted, or any contempt made of the enemie. It is good to imagine, that he may prooue able enough to finde you play ſufficient, if fortune looke fauourably on his cauſe: conſidering, that when men are too confident, either of their owne right, or truſting to their owne ſtrength: it procureth their ruine and totall deſtruction, through ouer-bolde preſumption, albeit the victorie were their due.
                  Fauour me Sir to tell you, that if you well conſider, with whom you haue to deale: mee thinkes, an aduantageable peace were more honourable for you, than a hazardous and doubtfull warre, falling out more ſtrangely then can bee imagined. You know Amadis, and the reſt (by whom hee is backt and ſupported) to bee all good Knights, men of great ſpirit, and all of them nearely alyed to Kings and potent Princes, who will not faile them for any diſaſter, or death it ſelfe. You know alſo, on the other ſide, that the moſt part of your ſubjects, neuer liked or thought well of the deliberation (meerly made by your ſelfe) for marrying your daughter to the Emperour, the onely motiue and occaſion of this warre. And therefore, you may be well aſſured, that how ſoeuer they beare it with a ſmooth brow, and rankerous ſpleen inwardly: they can be eaſily contented, that all ſhould goe but badly on your ſide, by not following their liking; howbeit, I make no doubt, but that they will ſerue you in all loyalty.
                  You haue ſaid well, anſwered the King, but wee are not now to ſtand vpon theſe tearmes. I doe not craue your counſell, whether I ſhould determine peace or warre: but only would know of you, by what means I may be beſt reuenged. Sir (quoth hee) by my former ſpeeches, you may eaſily knowe that. Aſſemble your forces & ſend to your friends for aſſiſtance: eſpecially to the Emperour of Rome, becauſe this caſe concerneth him, as nearely as you. Afterward, your Army beeing ready, march on (without any dallying) towardes them whom you meane to aſſault. But before you doe this, it were good (in mine oppinion) to practice ſome meanes, whereby you may call home ſome that are farre off from your ſeruice, partly through diſcontentment, & partly by wrongs offered. I vrge this motion, becauſe if they be not willing to ayde you; they ſhould not reſolue to offend you. For, being forth of your Land, it would fal out dangerous, if they ſhould conſpire and bend themſelues againſt you, if Fortune doe lowre that day vpon you. For, many times it comes to paſſe, that diſtaſtes and diſſents led by length of time, doe ſooneſt make their outward appearance, when his power (againſt whom the conſpiracy is meant) growes weake & decayed. Wherefore Sir, this is one of the chiefeſt points, whereof you are maturely to conſider.
                  Truly, ſaid the King, I know that you haue ſpoken to the purpoſe, & will do therein what I can. Sir, ſaid Grumedan, Amadis hath bin (here-tofore)

ſo well accepted in your Court, as no man poſibly could be more: and I could heartily wiſh, that thoſe villaines which cauſed this ſo long ſeparation, had neuer been borne into the world. And although I am his friend intirely, ſo ſhall I bee no enemy to you, if you deſiſt from beeing his. Wherefore, according to the aduice giuen you by King Arban: it were good, that (aboue all other things) you reconcile them to you that pertake with him, winning their hearts and willes by little and little: as eaſily you may doe, giuing them good lookes and gracious language. Then hauing the help of Rome, and other your allies, as the Kings of Ireland Suetia, I make no queſtion, but you may (with little eaſe) attaine to your intention, euen according to your owne minde.
                  But my good Lord, ſaid Guillan, before any matter at all be attempted, it were good to know, if thoſe men may bee reſolued on, whom you haue named. Are you ſure that the Emperour will meddle in the cauſe? He is a man of very ſlender faith, and as ill affected of his owne people, as can be. Are you certaine alſo, that the King of Suctia will doe as you ſay? If his Maieſtie were ſo pleaſed. Ambaſſadours ſhould be ſent to them ſpeedily, to entreate their fauour in this caſe, ſhewing them apparantly: that if reuenge for ſuch a wrong were iuſtly inflicted, it would with-draw any from attempting the like. In good ſadneſſe, ſaide the King, you haue very well aduiſed, and becauſe you (Lord Guillan) doe ſufficiently vnderſtand the buſineſſe: I pray you take the charge vpon you to the Emperor, for I know no Knight more able to preuaile with him, then you are. Sir, ſaide Guillan, I was not borne but for your ſeruice, when, and where you ſhall pleaſe to commande mee. Make ready then (quoth the King) to morrow you ſhall haue Letters of credence only, and the reſt remaine to your owne report.
                  So they aroſe from Councell, and each man returned to his lodging, till the next morning: when the King ſending for Guillan, ſaide vnto him. Lord Guillan, according to our concluſion yeſter-day, you muſt depart towards the Emperor, and with as much expedition as may be. To him make knowne, how matters haue come to paſſe, that hauing deliuered my daughter to his Ambaſſadours: ſhee was afterwards ſurpriſed from them, and forcibly carried to the Encloſed Iſle, his men all ſlaine, or taken priſoners, whereof hee ought to haue reſpect, this iniury redounding as much to him as me. If he offer aid, and will leuy an Army to be reuenged: ſay, that on my part ſhall be no defailance, in any thing my power can ſtretch vnto. If you find him willing to proceed effectually, returne againe with all poſſible diligence: that our enemies may haue no leaſure to fortifie themſelues, as I am certaine they intend to doe.
                  Sir, anſwered Guillan, God giue me grace to accompliſh your will in this, and any thing elſe you ſhall pleaſe to employ mee in. Worthy friend ſaid the King, there are your Letters of credence, and if it bee poſſible, ſet away to morrow morning early, for one of my beſt Ships is made ready for you, and waites your comming in the hauen. Sir, replied Guillan, there ſhall bee no want of duty in me. And ſo taking his leaue, and giuing order for his further affaires, he went aboard,

and ſet away. The very ſame day Brandoynas alſo was diſpatched for Galuanes, in the Iſle of Mongaza, and from thence into Ireland, to King Cildadan, to make ready ſo many men as he could. Philipinell was ſent to Gaſquilan,, King of Suetia, who ſometime came into Great Brittaine, to approue his manhood againſt Amadis. King Laſuart ſent him word, that if his ſpleene as yet continued: hee ſhould now haue better meanes then euer, becauſe the warre was intended againſt him.
                  So farre did theſe newes fly abroad, that they came to the vnderſtanding of Archalaus the Enchanter, to his no little ioy and comfort; intending (by this occaſion) the vtter ruine of King Liſuart, and likewiſe, of Amadis. And for his ſpeedier attaining thereto, he went preſently to King Aramyne: who hearing of his ariuall, gaue him moſt royall entertainement, preſuming peremptorily, that hee would not come into his countrie, but vpon ſome very vrgent occaſion. Beeing priuately ſeated together, Archalaus thus began.
                  Sir, ſome few dayes ſince, I receiued credible information, that King Liſuart and Amadis de Gaule (two of the deadlieſt enemies you haue) are fallen vpon ſuch a quarrell: as, without any hope of peace euer to come betweene them, they muſter men for a maine battell, out of which they cannot eſcape, but with the finall deſtruction of the one, or other, & (perhaps) of them both together. And becauſe occaſion doth expreſſely call you, as wel to reuenge your former loſſes in times paſt, as alſo to extend your limits, by peaceable making your ſelfe King of Great Brittaine: me thinkes you ſhould not delay the muſtering of your men, and ſummoning all your friends together, that while they cauill, & maintaine their quarrell ſo farre off, you may take ſo apt an aduantage, and make an eaſie entrance into Brittaine. If they chance to meet, and fight the field; then, without giuing the leaſt leaſure to the conqueror, to breath or refreſh his followers: you may ſet vpon him ſo opportunately, and bid him ſo hot an vnexpected battaile, as none of them can eſcape with life.
                  Now Sir, to acquaint you with the cauſe of their enmity, you muſt vnderſtand, that King Liſuart ſending his eldeſt daughter for Rome, hauing giuen her as wife to the Emperour: Amadis de Gaule (one of them, who in your laſt loſt battaile, termed himſelfe Knight of the Serpent, and then wore (as you well remember) a golden helmet) with a great many more, met the Romans on the Sea, ſet vpon them, and ouercomming them, ſlew the Prince Saluſte Quide, a near kinſman to the Emperour. The reſt were taken priſoners, with the Ladies & Gentlewomen, whom they conueyed to the Encloſed Iſle, where as yet they keepe them. Now indeede I cannot certainely reſolue you, what matter mooued them to begin this warre, but I am well aſſured, that King Liſuart in reuenge of this iniury, gathers as great an Army together as hee can. And Amadis hath ſent into all parts for ſuccour, purpoſing to ſtand vpon his owne defence, if he ſhall be aſſailed.
                  During theſe buſie troubles, Sir, you haue an excellent occaſion (if you pleaſe) to ſhew them as ſubtill a ſleight as euer was done, ſetting vpon them as I haue directed you. And becauſe (at the very firſt ſight) you may diſcerne your victory to

be certaine: I will worke ſo much, that Barſinan, Lord of Sanſuegna, ſonne to him whom the King burned at London, and likewiſe all they of the linage of Dardan the Proude, whom Amadis foyled at Vindoliſore, ſhall come to your aide, with the King of the Profound Iſle. Wherfore, perſwade your ſelfe, that being aſſiſted with ſo great a number of good Knights: there is no doubt to be made, but you ſhall reach the height of your deſire.
                  My worthy good friend Archalaus, anſwered the King Aranigne, you tell mee great matters, and although I was fully determined, neuer more to tempt fortune, ſhe hauing ſhewen me ſuch ſlender fauor in times paſt, yet me thinks it were a great folly, to foreſlowe ſuch occaſions, as freely come to offer themſelues, for the augmentation of my honour and profit. For, if in ſuch caſes, attempts managed by reaſon, haue as happy iſſue as men can wiſh: the fruit of ſuch a labour is well gathered, when deſert holds vp the lappe to receiue it. But if it ſhould fall out otherwiſe, yet (at leaſt) that muſt be performed, wherto all men ſtand bound by vertue, for maintenance of their authority, which is not to be valued by paſſed misfortunes, as (when a happy houre preſents it ſelfe) they ſhould refuſe to embrace it, as declaring themſelues to be daſtardly minded, and voide of all courage and magnanimitie. Seeing then wee are ſo forward in tearms, let it ſuffice, that I faithfully credit you, and deſire you (while I am prouiding mine Army) to take order for the reſt, ſending to Barſinan and our other friends, for their effectuall ioyning with vs.
                  
                     Archalans hauing heard this reſolution, made no long ſtay with King Aranigne: but taking leaue of him, iournied ſo diligently, that hee ariued in the countrie of Sanſuegna, where hee found Barſinan. To him he tolde all the paſſed conference, ſetting before his iudgement, what an execrable iniurie King Liſuart had done to his father, ſuffering to bee burned aliue by a tower, from the toppe where-of (afterward) hee cauſed his brother Gandandell to bee throwne downe, whom Guillan le Penſif had taken priſoner. And doe you think (quoth he) that had it not been for this Amadis de Gaule, but Barſinan your father, had peaceably beene King of Great Brittaine? But that villaine came, and after hee had reſcued Oriana from mee, cauſed all the reſt of my enterpriſe to bee vtterly voide. But now you haue time conuenient to bee reuenged, therfore, except you will ſhew your ſelfe dull & baſe minded; delay no longer, conſidering, that King Aranigne is ready to aſſiſt you.
                  Eaſily did Barſinan beleeue all that hee had ſaid, and promiſed to appeare in field, ſo ſoone as any need required. So Archalaus departed thence, to the King of the Profound Iſle, and gaue to him the very ſame inſtructions. Hauing obtained what he deſired, he returned homeward, and croſſing the countrie, aduiſed all the kindred of Dardan the Proude, to be in a readineſs, to depart away when they ſhould be commanded. But at this inſtant; our Hiſtory ſpeakes no more there-of: but returnes to the fortunes of Quedragant and Brian, being vnder ſaile for the Encloſed Iſle.
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XI.
                  
                     How Quedragant and Brian, ſayling on the Sea, by a ſudden and vnexpected tempeſt, were caſt ſo farre out of their courſe, that hauing loſt all knowledge of land; they met (accidentally) with Queen Briolania: And what happened to them.
                  
                  
                     
                        QVedragant and Brian beeing on the maine Seas, ſhaped their cō
                     paſſe for the Encloſed Iſle: but vpon a ſudden, the windes began to blow ſo ſtearnely, and ſuch a violent tempeſt aroſe, as the beſt man of courage among them, made little account of eſcaping, ſeeing their ſaile yardes and tacklings broken in peeces, and with ſuch impetuous guſts of contrarie windes, as truſting neither to ſtearne, or any hope elſe, but the mercy of God only, and the waues, they expected ſinking euery minute. So long they ran this diſaſterous fortune, that the dead darke night ouer-tooke them, with extreame thunders, and flaſhes of lightning, which was their beſt meanes for ſeeing one another: till day-breake appeared, the windes grew appeaſed, and the Sea (by little and little) indifferently calmed.
                  Now they could plainely perceiue, that they were caſt farre enough out of their courſe, for they diſcouered the coaſt of Sobradiſa: and as they were preparing thither, they eſpied a goodly great Shippe ſayling towardes them, which they determined to call to, to knowe who was aboard her. Comming more neare, they beheld vpon the decke, diuerſe Ladies and Gentle-women, and ſome Knights among them, diſcourſing together: where-upon, before they would preſume any further, they put forth a Frigate, commanding one of their Squires, to goe know of whence, & what they were. The Squire performed his charge, and going aboard the Ship, humbly ſaluted ſuch as he ſaw there, ſaying. Lords and Ladies, there are Gentlemen in yonder ſhip, who (in curteſie) deſire to vnderſtand, what you are, and whither you are bound. Honeſt friend anſwered one of them, ſay, that the Queene of Sobradiſa is here, and longs to be at the Encloſed Iſle.
                  
                  Theſe newes Sir, anſwered the Squire, will be very welcome to two Knights, that ſent mee to you, who are alſo bound for the ſelfe ſame place. Honeſt Squire, ſayde the Queene, tell vs then their names, if you may do it. Indeed Madame (quoth hee) I ſtand charged to the contrary. But thus much I dare tell you, that they tooke ſhipping in Great Brittaine, to returne to the Pallace of Apolidon; where they had been before now, if fortune had not hindred their voyage. But I am very certaine, that their ioy (for meeting with you) will make them forget all their paſſed danger: wherefore I will returne againe to them, and tell them what I haue heard of you. So ſaying, he went back to the Ship from whence hee came, and declared to Quedragant & Brian his anſwere, where-of they were not a little ioyfull. And drawing nearer, ioyned their veſſell with the Queenes, and going aboard, humbly ſaluted her.
                  
                     
Here I muſt tell you, that ſhee many times (formerly) had ſeene them at London, and in diuerſe other places, which made her the ſooner take knowledge of them: and entertayning them with all honourable reſpect, ſhee ſpake thus vnto them. Before God, Gentle-men, next to Amadis de Gaule, to whom I ſtand very much obliged, it were hard for mee to meet with more welcome men, and I pray you tell mee, what fortune hath conducted you hither: becauſe Tantiles Maſter of my houſholde, aſſured mee that hee ſawe you ſette ſaile for Great Brittaine, about buſineſſe for the Princeſſe Oriana. Madame, anſwered Quedragant, Tantiles tolde you true, and wee haue beene with King Liſuart, and vſed our beſt endeauour to make peace betweene him, and our friends in the Encloſed Iſle: but hee miſliking ſo faire a concluſion, wee are the more onward for tearmes of warre.
                  Then hee reported at large, what ſpeeches had paſt betweene King Liſuart and him, and in what manner they parted. But (quoth hee) we were no ſooner put to Sea, but ſo violent a tempeſt ouertooke vs, as we expected nothing but drowning: and by theſe meanes, haue wee runne ſo farre from our right courſe. In good faith, ſaide ſhe, wee haue had our part of the tempeſt too, and greatly feared the ſinking of our Shippe, conſidering what dangers ſhee hath endured. And let mee tell you, two whole daies are already paſt, ſince we ſet forth from Sobradiſa: expreſſely to goe ſee Amadis and Madame Oriana, and all the good company there with them. Our hope was to make more haſte thither, than wee haue done, as fearing, leaſt King Liſuart had already ſe
                        •
                     , his forces, in refuſing the honeſt offers you made him. But for ought I can perceiue, hee greatly forgets him-ſelfe, whereat I much maruaile, and it ſeemes, that hee is wearied with his long continued good fortune: beginning warre ſo raſhly, with them that haue done him ſo many great ſeruices, whereof hee may repent him at leaſure. For Lord Amadis will finde ſo many ſure friends, and all ready at his command: that King Liſuart (it may be) will ſee himſelfe deceiued in his expectation.
                  As for my ſelfe (quoth ſhee) vpon this onely, and no other cauſe, haue I left Tantiles behinde, with expreſſe charge, to leuy in my territories, twelue hundred able men for warre, and to bring them away with all poſſible ſpeed. But if it might ſo pleaſe you wee would be very glad of your company, ſeeing we are thus ſo well mette together. Madame, ſaide Brian, ſeeing your Ship is much crazed, may it pleaſe you to goe aboard ours, and yours ſhall follow, whereto all agreed. And ſo they ſet on, deuiſing together, on many matters: till at length, they eſpied two men of warre vnder ſayle, which Tiron had purpoſely ſent forth, to diſappoint and ſurprize the Queen.
                  Now, concerning this Tiron, whereof I now make mention to you, hee was the ſonne to Abiſeos, whom Amadis and Agraies contended withall, in the citie of Sobradiſa: according as you haue alreadie heard, in the firſt booke of this Hiſtory. By whoſe death, and likewiſe of his two eldeſt ſonnes, Briolania remained peaceably Queene of the whole countrie: except of one Caſtle only, wherein, this Tiron (third ſonne to the ſaide Abiſeos) was ſaued by an ancient

Knight, who had the charge of him, and therefore there nouriſhed him, till he came to able age of bearing Armes, and to receiue knighthood. Then hee began to worke wonders, ſo that hee was reputed, for one of the beſt and boldeſt Knights then liuing. Which the aged Knight perceiuing, hee put him in minde to compaſſe the recouery of his loſt country againe, preſſing him ſo importunatly, to reuenge the death of his father, and brethren: that he reſoluedly determined, to aduenture the taking of Queen Briolania, and afterward, to make him ſelf an abſolute King, if he could.
                  Hereupon, hee being informed, that ſhee embarked her ſelfe for the Encloſed Iſle, and but with a ſmall company: made ready two Ships, & with an hundred hardy Knights, lay hulling on the Sea before, to execute the full of his intent. The ſunne grew to declining, and night not farre off, wherefore Brian and Quedragant, doubting to be aſſaulted: ſtood on their guard, becauſe they ſaw the other make a pace towards them, by help of their Oares. Being come neare vnto them, they heard the voyce of a man, calling out aloud to them, in this manner. Knights, you that accōpany Queen Briolania, tell her, that her Coſen Tiron is here, and would ſpeake with her: commanding you her people, not to ſtand vpon any defence againſt vs, leaſt wee hew you in peeces, and beſtow no better fortune on her.
                  When the Queene heard theſe wordes, ſhee was ſurpriſed with a wonderfull feare, and trembled exceedingly, ſaying to Brian. Alas Sir, wee are all vndone, this is the greateſt enemy that I haue in the world: and beleeue, that he would neuer come in this manner, but to deale with vs as cruelly as hee can. Madame, anſwered Quedragant, feare not any thing, if he aſſault vs, hee will (perhaps be better welcomed, then hee lookes for. For my companion & ten of your Knights, ſhall take charge for reſiſting one of their Ships: and I and the reſt will deale with Tiron, vnto whom he ſpake thus. Knight, thou that deſireſt to ſee the Queene: come hither aboard her Shippe, and ſhe will gladly heare thee, otherwiſe, not. Come aboard? quoth Tiron, why, that is my meaning; in the deſpight of her and thee, or any elſe whatſoeuer.
                  So turning inſtanſtly the prow of his Ship, & ſiding the Queenes, the grappling irons were caſt forth, to faſten them together: and making a ſigne to his other Shippe, to fight couragiouſly, the aſſault beganne very ſharpe and dangerous. Wherein hee vſed but ſilly prouidence, making ſmall account of the Queenes ſtrength, which he found greater than hee was aware of. And Tiron, ſcuffling ouer negligently in his owne quarrell, would needes ſtep into the Queenes ſhippe: but his tarrying there was longer then he looked for, for Quedragant meeting there with him, found him ſuch tough play, as Tiron was beaten downe, and committed to ſafe cuſtodie, albeit his Knights did their vttermoſt endeauour to reſcue him. Neuertheleſſe, in the concluſion, not one of them all eſcaped in their reſſiſtance, but was either ſlaine, or taken priſoner. This ſo daunted their courages, that (by little and little) getting vp aloſt on the deck, they began to cut the cords of the grappling irons, which faſtened the two Ships together. But Quedragant perceiued it, and ſeeing fortune was onely for him, in the

deſpight of Tirons Knights: he entred their Shippe, where hee made ſuch a maſſacre, as hee quickly became maſter thereof.
                  In the meane while, Brian kept heade with them in the other Ship, and although hee was grieuouſly wounded, yet could they gaine nothing againſt him: but, ſeeing their companions loſt, gaue ouer fight, and laboured to gette away by all meanes they could vſe, and ſo the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle were Lords of the victory. Hereupon, Quedragant appointed guards for the Ship which hee had conquered, then hee entred into that where Queene Briolania was, who (during all the fight) ſate cloſely in her cabin, more dead than aliue, onely through her extreame feare. But when ſhee ſaw Quedragant, her heart was cheered, & then ſhe queſtioned the ſucceſſe of her enemies.
                  Madame, quoth hee, the moſt part of them are ſlaine, drowned and fled, and the reſt (I hope) will giue you no ill language: eſpecially Tiron, whom hee commanded (by his guardes) to be brought thither, as accordingly they did, and hee fearing ſome cruell death to be inflicted on him, fell downe at the Queenes feete, ſaying. Alas Madame, for the honour of God take pittie on mee, and without obſeruing my fooliſh enterpriſe, excuſe my youth. I am of your blood, and may hereafter do you ſome ſeruice, if it will pleaſe you to ſaue my life. Tiron ſaid ſhe, not for any loue wee beare you, but for ſome other reaſon mouing vs thereto: you ſhall not die now, nor till I ſhall be better aduiſed, how to deale with you. So he was ſent backe to his priſon, and Brian came ſore wounded with an arrow, which pierced quite thorough his ſhield, and ſunne a great way into his arme. The Queen was ſo grieued therat, as nothing could more diſpleaſe her, fearing the harme to be farre worſe then it was indeed. Neuertheleſſe, concealing her owne thoughts, ſhe (being very skilfull in Chirurgery) ſaid, it was a matter of nothing, and doubted not, but within few dates, he ſhould be ſafe and ſound againe.
                  With her owne hands ſhee inſtantly vnarmed him, and applied ſuch medicines to the hurts, as were moſt expedient. Afterwards, ſetting ſayle, they held on their courſe to the Encloſed Iſle, where they ariued, euen as Amadis and ſome other Knights were walking on the ſands. Seeing theſe Ships making in thither, they went on, to be further reſolued of thē: when preſently they knew the Squires of Quedragant & Brian, as the were comming firſt to Land. Being minded, to queſtion ſome newes of their Maſters, they ſawe them entring into the port: wherefore, euery one ſtroue, who ſhould bee formoſt to welcome them; but they were much amazed, to ſee the other Shippes which they brought with them.
                  
                     Brian perceiuing their doubt in this kinde, ſaid vnto them pleaſantly ſmiling. You know Gentlemen, when wee parted from this place, we went away with one Ship onely, and now you ſee how our ſtore is encreaſed, meerly by conqueſt, and with a greater booty than you imagine, wherein you are to haue no part or aduantage. For, ſeeing fortune hath been ſo fauourable to vs, her bleſſings muſt remaine to vs: and not to you, that loyter here in idleneſſe, while we labour and trauaile. Well Sir, anſwered Amadis, it ſhall ſuffice vs, to partake in the pleaſure you haue had: prouided,

you muſt tell vs, if the booty be ſo great as you would make vs belieue. Nay, much greater ſaid Brian, & to approue my words, is it not a faire conqueſt, to win a Queen, & ſuch a one, as ſhe of Sobradiſa, with many beautifull Ladies, and Gentlewomen beſide, as you ſhall ſee immediately? By my faith, ſaid Amadis, your booty cannot bee tearmed ſmall.
                  As thus they paſſed on their pleaſant talke, the Queene and her women were landed, and euery man was ready and dutifull, to welcome them with all poſſible honour, and goodly Palfrayes, were preſently brought, wherupon they all mounted, and ſo rode on to the Pallace of Apolidon. On the way, Amadis giuing gracious entertainement to Briolania, ſpake thus. Madme, it is to mee no little ioy, to ſee you in theſe parts ſafe & well, accounting my ſelf more beholden to you then euer, that you would take ſo much paines, as come and ſee vs: eſpecially, in ſuch a time of no meane tribulation, and when you may beſt comfort Madame Oriana, whom you ſhall ſee ſo ouer-gone with griefe, as no one poſſible can ſuffer more. But I hope your preſence will be ſo pleaſing to her, as ſhe will learne to forget a great part of her melancholy.
                  My Lord (quoth ſhee) for this cauſe only haue I left my countrie, and God doth beſt knowe, what griefe I haue endured in your abſence, neuer hearing any tydings of you. Yet I receiued ſome comfort by the ariuall of Tantiles, whom I haue left at home in my countrey, to leauy men for warre, according as you haue ſent me worde by him: and I my ſelfe had taken the matter in hand, but for my earneſt deſire to ſee you and Madame Oriana. Neuertheleſſe, without the help of Quedragant and Brian, mine enterpriſe was in danger to bee diſapointed, as at more leaſure I ſhall let you fully vnderſtand.
                  Here I muſt tell you, that Amadis (ſo ſoone as hee ſaw Queen Briolania there ariued) ſent to aduertiſe the Princeſſe Oriana thereof, to entreate the acceptation of her company, which accordingly ſhee did, becauſe ſhee loued and eſteemed her extraordinarily, in ſo much, as ſhee ſaid to the Queene Sardamira. Madame, you ſhall ſee annon, one the moſt faire & gracious Princeſſe that euer you beheld, and one that deſerues our very beſt entertainement. Wherefore let me ſo much preuaile with you, that you Mabila and Olinda, will goe welcome her at the Parke gate, where ſhee is to allight, and giue her all kinde & gracious welcome. Hereupon they three (without any tarying) went along, and as they opened the gate, Briolania came thither, accompanied as you haue formerly heard: where Amadis tooke her from her horſe, and beholding them that ſtayed for her, he ſaid. I perceiue Madame, that wee muſt leaue you, for I ſee my Coſen Mabila, is come to depriue vs of your company.
                  Shee had vnderſtood before, that Oriana was retyred by her ſelfe, only accompanied with her women, and none elſe: wherefore (ſmiling) ſhe thus anſwered Amadis. Be you Sir then hence forth religiou
                        ••
                      honeſt: And yet I feare you would faine bee my confeſſor. 
                        〈◊〉
                      Madame, quoth hee) I would I were able to appoint you ſufficient 
                        •
                     enance, for the harme you haue done with that piercing eye, you ſhould be ſure of puniſhment enough. As hee ſpake theſe wordes, hee would haue ſtept into the Parke: but Mabila
                     
areſted him, ſaying. Coſen, our order forbids you, to paſſe any further: therefore goe back, or elſe wee haue power to excommunicate you. Marry God forbid ſaid hee, I had rather bid you and your company good night, than run into ſuch an heynous danger. So, taking leaue of them, the gate was made faſt againe, and Briolania conducted to Orianaes chamber, where ſhee attended her comming, with all her other Ladies and Gentle-women, and gaue her very worthy welcome: and being much affected to her, ſhee was the more willing to let her know how glad ſhee was of her ariuall there, ſaying. Madame, you haue taken extraordinarie paines, to come and ſee me in ſo remote a countrie, and at a time of ſuch affliction: whereby I well perceiue, that good will and affection ſo long time borne me, meerly brought you hither, and cauſed your kinde voyage.
                  Madame, anſwered Briolania, ſo ſoone as I was aduertiſed of your eſtate, I could not forbeare, but come my ſelfe in perſon to ſee you, with whatſoeuer remaineth in my power to doe for you. For, ouer & beſides the good I heartily wiſh you, it is generally knowne, by how many ſeuerall duties Lord Amadis hath bound me to him: and therefore ſuch matters as concerne him, I account as much or more mine owne. And for this reaſon I haue leſt Tanti
                           ••
                        s (whom you wel know) behinde mee, to leauie Knights and bold ſouldiers in my countries, and very ſpeedily hee will bee here with them, according to the truſt I haue alwaies repoſed in him. In the meane while, ſo it may be no offence to you, I will keep you company, till your affaires haue a happy and ſucceſſefull ending.
                  Very graciouſly did Oriana thank her declaring, how ſhee expected the returne of Quedragant and Brian, who were gone to her father King Liſuart, to procure peace, if poſſibly it might be. Now although Briolania knew what anſwere they had receiued, yet would ſhee not ſpeake thereof: becauſe Graſinda came to them, whom Briolania hauing neuer ſeen before, demanded of Oriana, what ſhe was. I promiſe you Madame (quoth ſhee) this is the only woman in the world, of a ſtranger, to whom Lord Amadis ſtands moſt beholding: for, but by her meanes, you had neuer ſeene him here. then ſhee related, what ſuccour ſhee had giuen him, by the care and paines of Maſter Eliſabet, his honourable entertainements in her dominions, and finally, all that hath beene alreadie declared. And to the ende, ſaid Oriana, that you may come the better acquainted with her, and heare her report her owne curteſies: if you pleaſe, wee will ſup together, without any other company, but only wee three, and my Coſen Mabila.
                  
                  
                     Oriana did this, not only to pleaſure and delight Queene Briolania, but her ſelfe alſo: who neuer could be ſatisfied, with hearing thoſe paſſed fortunes repeated, almoſt numberleſſe times in a day, whereupon ſhe called to Mabila, ſaying. Coſen, Queene Briolania findes her ſelfe not halfe well, beeing wearied with long trauelling on the Sea: giue order therefore, to couer for ſupper here in my chamber, where wee will admit none elſe with vs, but Madame Grafinda. Mabila gaue preſent enſtructions hereof to the reſt, ſo that all left the lodging, but onely the foure Ladies together, who (very ſoone after) ſate downe at the table, and as they were

in the midſt of their ſeruice: Oriana (minding nothing more, than to heare Graſinda talke of Amadis) ſaid vnto her as followeth.
                  Madame, no longer agoe then yer-while, I reported to Queene Briolania, the battaile between Amadis, and the Monſter Endriagus: but ſhee will not beleeue me, except you giue her further aſſurance thereof. Therefore I humbly entreate you, that you would make diſcourſe thereof to her, according as Maſter Eliſabet affirmed it to you, and likewiſe, how it was your fortune (at firſt) to meet him in the fields. Then Graſinda, to pleaſe them all, declared, how comming from Sadina (the principall Citie of her Land) accompanied with diuerſe Knights, eſpecially Brandaſidel eſpied Amadis ryding along the Sea ſhore, ſhewing a countenance of much griefe and ſadneſſe. For, ſo ſoone as hee beheld vs, hee turned out of he way, euen as hee would haue auoided the combate from his profeſſed enemy. Which Brandaſidell obſeruing, and bearing mee then ſome inward affection: See (quoth hee) I pray you, the man-hood of theſe knights, that tearme themſelues Knights errant, ſo ſoon as he ſaw one, fearing the ſight hee was glad to turne bridle. By God, let me neuer more put Armour on my backe, if I bring him not back againe to you, with more haſte then hee makes away, and then I will make him to ſerue as your ſlaue.
                  Then, though I laboured to my very vttermoſt, to turne him from this friuolous intention: yet would hee needs ride on till he ouertooke him, and then he would haue conſtrained him to come backe. But Amadis, neither caring for him, nor his greateſt threatnings, entred the ſight with him: wherein Brandaſidell found ſuch harſh entertainement, as at length hee was puniſhed with his owne appointed penaltie, which was this, that the vanquiſhed ſhould ride backwarde mounted on his horſe, and holde the tayle inſteed of a bridle. It did not a little pleaſe mee, to ſee him come riding in ſuch hanſome order, & ſo confounded with ſhame, that it was worſe than death to him, as well appeared by his countenance. Then I demaunded of him, what hee had done with the Knight, whom hee ſware and promiſed to bring to me. But he not anſwering me one word, I ſent one of my women to Amadis, and entreated him (in curteſie) to come ſpeake with mee, which hee refuſed not to doe.
                  In our conference together, hee breathed foorth many a vehement ſigh, which cauſed me inſtantly to imagine, that the power of loue ouer-awed him, and affecting ſome Lady, by whom (perhaps) hee ſawe himſelfe ſo ſlenderly regarded; as hee was inforced to be abſent, without letting her know his purpoſed trauailes, and I iudged withall, that hee was a man of more note, than outwardly hee ſeemed to be. Here-upon, I ſo earneſtly importuned him, as hee vouchſafed to accept a lodging in my Caſtle, and there hee ſoiourned ſome few daies: during which time, keeping him company, and obſeruing his youth and faire diſpoſition, it ſeemed to mee, that ſhee might well repute her ſelfe moſt happy, that could enioy him as a friend or husband.
                  Now, although before his ariual, I found my ſelfe no way enclined to any ſuch humor, beeing neuertheleſſe newly widdowed: yet affection then preuailed ſo farre with me, as I was neuer more amorous

of a man, then of him. So that, without taking any reſt, either day or night, my thoughts continually trauailed to him, vrging me ſo farre: that I muſt needs diſcouer my diſeaſe to Gandalin, who ſeemed an honeſt and diſcreet Squire, as after-ward I well perceiued by his anſweres. For, without telling me any of his Maſters affaires, hee gaue mee plainely to vnderſtand, that he had ſo little cōmand ouer himſelfe, as all hope (on my behalfe) might well bee ſpared. And I beleeuing him, reſolued with my ſelfe, that it were better to quench the ſparks but newely kindling, then ſuffer them breake forth into a flame.
                  Wherefore I practiſed to finde the meanes (but not without paine enough) to ſet a ſtay vpon my raſh affection, and bring it againe to the former byas: and ſo much the rather, becauſe hee was to depart for Conſtantinople, accordingly as formerly hee had determined. And becauſe I had an aſpiring intention, to compaſ

                     e that (which afterwards I did) by his meanes: I made him promiſe me, to be with mee againe in the ſpace of a yeare, which accordingly hee performed, but not without moſt mighty danger. Then ſhee declared his conqueſt of the monſter Endriagus, and laſtly, all the other aduentures in their due order.
                  By my faith Madame (ſaid Briolania to Oriana, vpon this diſcourſe of Graſinda) I now call to minde, how when I came firſt to ſee you at Mirefleure, Lord Amadis paſſed by the Tents and Pauillions, there raiſed on the way, while I tooke the freſh ayre. Diuerſe Knights were then in my company, who fell into the like fortune, as her Brandaſidell did: for they thinking to cauſe him come ſpeake with mee vpon compulſion, were all diſgraced, & ſore wounded. You haue tolde me that oftentimes, anſwered Oriana: who receiued all theſe reportes to her owne aduantage, as being well aſſured, that this melancholy humor of Amadis had no other ground, but only by his ardent affection to her. So, inſtantly they went all to reſt, becauſe it grew to be very late.

                     Of the report deliuered by Quedragant and Brian, to the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, concerning their Embaſsie to King Lisuart; And of that which thereupon was reſoluedly determined.
                  
                  
                     
                        QVearagant and Brian, Ambaſſadours ſent to King Liſuart, being returned back againe to the Encloſed Iſle, as hath already been amply declared: beeing deſirous to render a reaſon of that they had done, mette on the morrow at Councell, purpoſely ſo appointed by Amadis and the other Knights. Whereupon, Quedragant, beeing to ſpeake for himſelfe and his companion; began at large to rehearſe his ſpeeches to the King, and the anſwer thereon made him. Which (quoth Quedragant) was ſo ſhort, as wee can conceiue no otherwiſe, but that he will deale with vs as hardly as hee can: conſidering, his prouiding of men for all partes, making full account to ſhew vs no mercy. And we haue no

great cauſe to be agreeued thereat, becauſe our honour and chiualrie will thereby bee more renowned, more then at any other time we can attaine vnto: for if we beare away the victory, it will bee ſpoken of through the world, to our fame, & his reproach.
                  Now, as oftentimes (in the like attempts) men declare themſelues to bee of diuerſe opinions: ſo here it fell out, for ſome allowed of war, and others were more leaning to peace. But Agraies, who bare but little loue to King Liſuart, for thoſe reaſons before alleadged, vndertaking to ſpeak for them all, beganne thus. Honourable Lords, I know not how (with any honeſty) we can giue ouer our intention of warre, conſidering what iuſt occaſion wee haue, and beſide, our enemy is in ſome forwardneſſe to come againſt vs. Notwithſtanding, it is no wiſdome in vs ſo to ſuffer him; but rather to muſter our forces ſpeedily, and march directly into his countrie, to let him wel vnderſtand what wee are. For, if wee permit him to come ſeeke vs heere, beleeue it vndoubtedly, it will ſo puffe him vp with pride: that hee (who of his owne nature is preſumptuous enough) will thinke he hath wonne the day at the very firſt landing. Beſides, we ſhall runne into our owne diſ-reputation many waies, in giuing occaſion to the ill-iudging world, not only to mſconſter the iuſtice of our cauſe; but alſo, to throwe ſome ſiniſter opinions on Madame Orianaes iniuries, for which wee are thus entred into Armes.
                  For my ſelfe, I ſweare to you vpon mine honour, had not her earneſt and inceſſant entreaties to me, not to ſpeake againſt peace been ſo vehement: I had neuer conſented that any Embaſſie ſhould haue bin ſent to Great Brittaine, beeing ſo much abuſed as wee are. But, ſeeing our enemy makes ſuch manifeſt ſhew of his mallice towards vs: I am now diſcharged of my promiſe, and abſolutely reſolued, neuer to enter league of loue or friendſhip with him; vntill hee haue felt, how well wee can ſtand vpon our owne defence, beeing enabled by as warlike powers, as any hee can bring againſt vs. Therefore my Lords, I am on the minde, that wee ſhould conclude on warre, and without any further deferring, ſo ſoon as our ſupplies are come: to ſet away directly for London, and there bid him battaile, if hee dare come forth to reſiſt vs.
                  This reſolution was wonderfully pleaſing to Amadis, who (til then) was in a continuall perplexity, as fearing, that warre would be deferred, and hee enforced to render backe his Oriana, than which, no greater miſery could befall him. Wherefore, ſeeing the greater part ioyned with Agraies; to aduantage farther this opinion, thus he ſpake. Noble Coſen, as yet I neuer noted any man in this company but hee was alwaies as forward to theſe affaires, as any one could be. If any man haue queſtioned thoſe inconueniencies, which commonly doe happen in warre: hee is not therefore to be taxed, as one that would exempt himſelf from the buſineſſe, but vſeth rather ſuch prouident ſpeeches, as in theſe caſes are fit and iuſt. And whereas you think it conuenient, that wee ſhould enter into King Liſuarts countrie, rather then giue him the leaſt leaſure to ſeek vs here: that deliberation hath alwaies dwelt on my thoughts, if the reſt of you my Lords and worthy friends, will haue it ſo. For by theſe

meanes (perceiuing vs to come ſo neare him) hee may ſuddenly alter his former opinion, and yeeld to that which wee haue requeſted. There was not a man in the whole aſſembly, but freely gaue his voice to this concluſion: And warre being fully agreed on, men were ſent forth, and ſcouts appointed to all places, as well to heare newes from Great Brittaine, as alſo for muſtering men together.
               
               
                  CHAP. XI.
                  
                     How Maſter Eliſabet ariued in the countrie belonging to Graſinda, and paſſed from thence (for Conſtantinople) to the Emperour, according to the charge giuen him by Amadis.
                     
                  
                  
                     AFter that Maſter Eliſabet was embarqued, he had ſo good a gale of wind, as (in few daies) he landed in Romania: where ſending for the chiefeſt lords of the countrie, hee gaue them to vnderſtand his charge, expreſſely commanding them to make ready a ſufficient number of horſe and foot, for paſſing thence to the Encloſed Iſle, ſo ſoone as he ſhould be returned from the Emperour, to whom hee was going for the ſame cauſe. Which they promiſed effectually to performe, and hee leaft a Nephew of his named Libeo, a young Knight and of good ſpirit, ſtill to ſolicet them in the buſineſſe: and hee ſet ſayle for Conſtantinople, where hee ariued without any impeachment. Being landed, he went to the Emperour, whom he found accompanied with many Princes & great Lords, and doing him humble reuerence, hee preſented him a Letter from Amadis de Gaule.
                  
                  The Emperour, who had known him a long time, welcomde him very graciouſly, & demanded of him, where hee had mette with Amadis de Gaule, of whom hee had heard ſo many great ſpeeches? Sir anſwered Maſter Eliſabet, I deale plainly with you, I neuer knew his name to be Amadis, vntill we were ariued in the Encloſed Iſle, and then he declared it himſelfe vnto vs. For, before that time, hee called himſelfe the Greek Knight, as fearing to be knowne by his other borowed name of the greene Sword, after his departure from you. And that was in regarde of his promiſe to my Lady Graſinda, for conducting her to the Court of King Liſuart, & there to maintaine againſt all commers, that ſhe was a fairer woman, than the choiceſt Virgin in all that countrie.
                  Then hee related (at large) how all things had paſt, eſpecially, his Combate (about that cauſe) againſt the Romanes, who meerely in preſumption vndertooke the fight, but ſpedde according to their deſerts. And indeede Sir (quoth hee) they thought that they cōtended againſt a Greeke Knight, ſo that, before they entered the Combate, they made little account of him, ſpeaking it publikely, that neuer Greek durſt be ſo bolde as to deale with a Roman, man to man, but eaſily ſhould vanquiſh him, as they had done many other before. But the ſucceſſe fell out contrary to their expectation: for they were foyled one after another, and (indeede) with no more then reſiſtance of cō
                     mon courſe. Beleeue me ſaide the

Emperour, I reioyce in all his happie fortunes, and credit it aſſuredly, that if I had meanes, whereby to doe him any pleaſure, hee ſhould well knowe that I am his friend to my vttermoſt power. Sir, anſwered Maſter Eliſabet, your gracious offer can neuer ſhewe it ſelfe in a more needfull ſeaſon, and now hee doth moſt humbly require it. Say you ſo? ſaid the Emperour, let me know how?
                  Then Maſter Eliſabet proceeded thus. Sir after hee had abated the Ramanes daring pride, he withdrew himſelfe to the Encloſed Iſle, which is his owne by iuſt title: and there he found a great number of Knights ready bound for the Sea, in ſuccour of Madame Oriana, eldeſt daughter to King Liſuart, whom (againſt her will) he would haue married to the Emperour of Rome, and quite diſ-inherited her, to aduance his youngeſt daughter Leonara, contrary to all aduice and opinion, not only of the Princes and Lords of his land, but alſo of his ſubiects in generall. Whereof Lord Amadis beeing aduertiſed, hee highly commended their enterpriſe, ſo that on the day enſuing, they put forth to Sea, and hulled about the ſtraites, for them that had the Princeſſe in charge. Manfully were they aſſayled, & (after a long and fierce conflict) vanquiſhed, taken priſoners, and the Ladies thus reſcued, conuayed to the Encloſed Iſle, where now they abide at this preſent.
                  Neuertheleſſe, they ſent Ambaſdours to King Liſuart, as well to let him vnderſtand, vpon what occaſion they had thus reſcued his daughter: as alſo to entreate her home acceptation againe, without ſending her any more ſo farre from him, conſidering the great wrong hee did therein to him ſelfe. But, as they doubted, ſo it came to paſſe, for without any regard to their honeſt offer: hee ſtood mainely on his owne ſtrength, and would haue that by force, which they tendered him freely. For this cauſe Sir, my Lord Amadis, and all his worthy band of Knights with him, do humbly entreate you, holding the prime place among Chriſtian Princes, & being Gods deputie and miniſter, to maintaine right and iuſtice (eſpecially, when ſuch a vertuous Princeſſe is ſo highly wronged) that you would be pleaſed, to ſend them ſome ſuccour; wherein you ſhall binde them all to you while they liue, or can bee imployed any way in your ſeruice, with their vttermoſt paines.
                  All this while, the Emperor lending an attentiue care to Maſter Eliſabets wordes, ſate very penſiue: as conſidering, that hardly would this enterpriſe be ended, without a long and doubtfull warre. For hee well knew, that King Liſuart was a Prince of vndauntable ſpirit, and the Emperour of Rome was a man immeaſurably proude, & too much opinionate of his owne fortune. On the other ſide, knowing what iuſt occaſion the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle had, to reſcue Oriana in ſo deep diſtreſſe, and how highly him ſelfe ſtood obliged to Amadis, not onely for the monſter Endriagus death, but alſo for taking ſuch pains as to come ſee him in Conſtantinople, and what bountifull offers hee had made him beſide; he reſolued to ſend him ſuccour with all ſpeed, ſpeaking thus to Maſter Eliſabet. My worthy good friend, Lord Amadis ſhall haue of mee his owne deſire, and ſuch an Army will I ſend him, as both Patin and King Liſuart ſhall well know, how dearly I reſpect and eſteeme him.
                  
                     
Theſe royall words were ſo pleaſing to all the Knights there preſent, eſpecially to Gaſtilles: as preſently hee fell vpon his knees, ſaying. Sir, if euer I did you any acceptable ſeruice, I moſt humbly entreate you, that (in recompence of all) you would pleaſe to permit me, that I may be one in the number of them, apointed for this honourable ſuccour, for I neuer vndertooke any voyage, that could bee more welcome to me than this. Nephew, anſwered the Emperour, you & the Marqueſſe Saluder ſhall goe together in my ſteede, and therefore giue order, that ſuch ſhipping bee made ready, as is needfull, for paſſage to the Encloſed Iſle, with tenthouſand approoued warriours, which ſhall goe with you. Sir, ſaid Maiſter Eliſabet, I muſt needs returne ſpeedily into Romania, where Graſinda (my Miſtreſſe) hath already taken order, for an Army of men leauied in this cauſe, and them to paſſe along with mee thither. Wherefore, may it pleaſe you to licence my departure, to the end, that in due time I may croſſe the Seas, and embarke our forces to ioyne with theirs. Friend, replied the Emperour, reſt your ſelfe here ſome two or three dayes, and afterwarde depart at your owne pleaſure.
               
               
                  CHAP. XII.
                  
                     How Gandalin ariued in Gaule; And of the ſpeeches betweene him and King Perion.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        GGandalin, being parted from the Encloſed Iſle, preuailed ſo well by his diligence, that in few dayes he ariued in Gaule, euen at the place where King Perion (as then) ſoiourned: who was not a little ioyfull to ſee him, as being aſſured, that hee brought ſome tydings of his ſonne, whom hee had not ſeene in ſix yeares and more. Hereupon, hee ſent immediately for him, and he hauing done ſuch dutie as became him, deliuered his Letters from Amadis, declaring, that he had left him in the Encloſed Iſland. Now, in regarde other matters of moment were referred to his report: the King demanded of him, what newes hee had to impart to him. Sir, ſaid Gandalin, my Lord and all his honorable companions, ſtand in great need of ſuccour from you. What is the matter? replied the King.
                  Then Gandalin (without omitting any thing) reuealed the whole buſineſſe, as you haue heard before diſcourſed. Hereat the King was much amazed, howbeit, hee made no outward ſhew thereof, and gaue command beſide, not to vſe any ſpeech of theſe newes, eſpecially to Galaor; becauſe (as yet) hee was very weake, by reaſon of a diſeaſe hanging long vpon him. But (quoth hee) if he demand wherefore thou art come hither; tell him it was to vnderſtand of my health: and to morrowe I will take order, according as thy Maſter hath required.
                  
                     Galaor had immediate intelligence, that Gandalin was come to Court: wherefore hee ſent to requeſt the King, that Gandalin might come to him, to tell him ſome tydings of his brother Amadis. And although hee was in ſuch weake

eſtate, that hee could hardly ſupport himſelfe: yet hee aroſe and embraced him, demanding how his Maſter fared. My Lord (quoth hee) I left him at the Encloſed Iſle in very ſound health, God be thanked for it, and in good hope to ſee you ſhortly: aſſuring you, it will be no little griefe to him, when hee ſhall heare of your long ſickneſſe. As thus they diſcourſed, Norandell entred the Chamber, who knowing Gādalin, asked if Amadis were come thither. No my good Lord, ſaid he, I left him at the pallace of Apolidon, where hee refreſheth him ſelfe after his many trauailes, in Almaigne, Romania, and Conſtantinople. My deare friend Gandalin (quoth Galaor) I pray thee tell mee what thou maiſt.
                  
                     Gandalin declared all his Maſters trauailes at large, to the no little maruaile of the hearers: eſpecially, when hee told all the manner of the fight with the monſter Endriagus. Alas, ſaid Galaor, when ſhall I ſee him? Soon enough (anſwered Norandell) if you would take ſome paines to recouer your health. Beleeue it (quoth Galaor) I will do my vtmoſt endeauour, not only for my health, but to eaſe my longing deſire to ſee him. My Lord, ſaid Gandalin, the King gaue me charge not to holde you with any long diſcourſe, in regarde of your feeble condition: wherefore, I pray you to ſpare my abſence now, and to morrowe I will keepe you longer company.
                  So Gandalin left them, and returned to the King, whom hee found ſtudying on the buſineſſe for his ſonne Amadis, and becauſe hee would keep his purpoſe ſecret: he determined to ſend Norandell into Great Brittaine, although hee was but newly come to his friend, hearing what a long ſickneſſe hee had. Hereupon, the next morning hee ſent for him, and euen as if inſtantly he had heard ſome nouell aduertiſement, hee ſaid vnto him. Worthy friend, this day I haue receiued newes, whereby (for ought I can perceiue) the King your father hath an enterpriſe in hand, wherein your ſeruice may much auaile him, and therefore I would aduiſe you to go to him. But let me entreate you, not to talke hereof to Galaor, conſidering in what weake eſtate he is, and it may bee greatly offenſiue to him. Sir, anſwered Norandell, I would bee loath to doe any thing hurtfull to him, and humbly thanke your Highneſs for your good coū
                     ſell: to morrow (with your leaue) I meane to part hence, and this day I meane to keep him company.
                  Changing this kind of diſcourſe, they fell to talke of other matters: till Norandel withdrew to his friend Galaor, ſpeaking to him in this maner. My honourable companion, I promiſed King Liſuart when I parted from him, to ſee him againe within a moneth after: wherefore, let not my departure ſo ſoone bee diſpleaſing to you, becauſe I am thereto enforced; and ſo much the rather, in regarde I ſee that the worſt is already paſt with you, and you are much better amended then before. Moreouer, the ſmall time of my Knighthoods employment, many others may highly miſinterpret, by my ſo long remayning idle, and hurle diuerſe blamefull aſpertions on me: which I am ſure will be but little pleaſing to you, knowing, that you loue mine honour as deare as your owne. Neuertheleſſe, if your ſickneſſe ſhould holde on in any long continuance (which heauen forefend) I promiſe to ſee you againe ſo ſoon as poſſibly I can.
                  
                     
                     Galaor was much diſconted at Norandels wordes, becauſe hee tooke great delight in his company: notwithſtanding, thus hee anſwered. vpon my faith, albeit you haue great occaſion to doe as you ſay: yet your abſence from mee will cauſe no meane griefe. Neuertheleſſe, preferring your honor before my pleaſure, I am content to let you goe when you will, deſiring you moſt earneſtly to doe my humble duty to the King, aſſuring him, that ſo long as life remaines in this body, hee ſhall finde me his loyall and faithfull ſeruant. So, embracing each other very affectionately, they parted, but not without wette eyes. Norandels Ship lying ready for him, and hauing taken leaue of King Perion and his Queene: the windes and Seas were ſo fauourable to him, as in few dayes he landed in the port of Vindiliſore, where King Liſuart was preparing his Armie, for the Encloſed Iſle. No ſooner had Norandell ſet ſaile, but King Perion muſtered men from all parts, and made ſhipping likewiſe ready, for their paſſage to the Encloſed Iſle, ſo ſpeedily as might be.
                  In the meane while, Laſinde, the Squire to Bruneo, beeing come to the Marqueſſe, diligently executed his commiſſion, and by pleaſing perſwaſions, compaſſed his intention alſo with Branfill: who ſeeing his father ſomewhat ſlowe and tardie in the buſineſſe caſt himſelfe at his feet, ſaying. My Lord, I would I had beene with my brother, to haue fought with the Romanes: ſurely, I ſhould haue reputed it for one of the faireſt fortunes, that euer (in this life) can befall me. But ſeeing my beſt ſtarres haue fayled mee therein, moſt humbly I entreat you, in recompence of that loſſe: to giue mee leaue to goe thither, with ſuch ſuccor as you ſhall pleaſe to ſend. I dare aſſure you father, that it will be both for your honor and your ſonnes: who (as you well know) haue long time been much bounden to Amadis and his friends. Sonne (quoth he) I am well contented, and ſeeing you haue ſuch deſire to warre; you ſhall haue Knights good ſtore to beare you company. As indeed hee had, for while Branfill was fitting all things in due order for him ſelfe, his father gaue charge for the other expedition of Souldiers.
                  Here you muſt likewiſe obſerue, that the good olde Gouernour Yſanio, who was ſent to King Taffinor of Bohemia: found 
                        •
                     here very gracious entertainement, knowing that hee came from the Knight of the greene Sword. For, after hee had deliuered his Letters, and his further meſſage fully vnderſtood; the King ſaid vnto him. I promiſe you Sir vpon my faith, I will not fayle him in ſo ſerious a buſineſſe, but he ſhall haue all that hee can require. Then he called his ſonne Graſandor, to whom hee declared all that Yſanio had tolde him, and the cauſe of his comming, demanding of him, if hee would vndertake the voyage for the aide of Amadis, who had called him ſelfe Knight of the greene Sword.
                  My Lord (quoth he) the greateſt deſire I haue in this world, is, to enioy the company of ſo good a Knight, and I deſire it of you moſt entirely. But becauſe I cannot leauy your army ſo ſoon, may it pleaſe you to let mee goe on before, accompanied onely with Twentie Knights: then Count Galtines may follow mee, and bring the reſt with him. Beleeue mee, anſwered the King, I am well contented, and do allow of your aduice, for beeing in

ſo worthie a company, your vertues will bee greatly encreaſed. And I confeſſe my ſelfe ſo highly beholding to him, that hee may well reſt aſſured, hee ſhall wholly diſpoſe of mee and mine. For which kindneſſe 
                        
                           •
                        ſanio humbly thankt him, and concluded to attend on Galtines, to cauſe him make the more haſte. In the meane while, Graſander embarked himſelfe, accompanied onely with twenty Knights, and parting from the port, put on to Sea.
                  On the other ſide, Landin, who was ſecretly ſent by Quedragant into Ireland, found meanes to ſpeake with the Queen, who hauing vnderſtood the cauſe of his comming to her: called ſome of her truſtieſt ſeruants, and commanded them, that (in the cloſeſt manner they could deuiſe) they ſhould gather a power of men, to goe to her Vncle in the Encloſed Iſle. And although ſhee bare but little loue to Amadis, hauing alwaies in memory, the death of King Abies her father: yet much more did ſhee hate King Liſuart, for the yearely tribute he compelled her husband King Cildadan to pay. Wherefore ſhee reſolued helpe the one, in hope to confound the other. But now our Hiſtory ſpeaketh no more concerning her, but leads you to another matter touching King Liſuart, who had ſent Guillan le Fenſif to the 
                        •…
                     
                     rour, and other meſſengers to other friends, to bee ſupplied in his purpoſed warre.

                        How Guillan le Penſif, ariued at the Emperours Court of Rome: Philipinell in Su

                        GVillan le Penſif, being diſpatched from King Liſuart, had ſuch ſpeedie ſayling & taruaile; as (in leſſe than three weekes) hee landed in the neareſt port to Rome. Then taking horſe, according to the cuſtome of the Knights of Great Brittaine, he rode on to the Emperour, who was then accompanied with a great number of Princes and Lords, purpoſely ſommoned to Court, for the entertainement of Madame Oriana, whoſe ariuall hee expected euery day. For the Prince Saluſte Quide, and Brandaiell de Reque had written to him, that King Liſuart had deliuered her to them, and that they were continually vpon their parting towards him. When the Emperour beheld Guillan, he knew him immediately, becauſe he had ſeene him many times before, and thinking hee brought him ſome newes of his long expected wiſh: demanded where hee had left the Prince Saluſte Quide, and the reſt of the traine. Sir, quoth hee, King Liſuart (my Maſter) hath ſent this Letter to you; command that it may be read to you, and then you ſhall be further ſatisfied in your demand. then the Emperour tooke the Letter, and although it contained ſome particular priuate credence: yet he would needes haue it publiquely read, and that hee (in like manner) ſhould deliuer what hee had to ſay. Sir, ſaid Guillan, my Maſter King Liſuart greets you thus, that in regarde of your perpetuall loue and alliance, hee was well content (according

to the requeſt made to him by your Ambaſſadours) to giue you as wife, Madame Oriana, his eldeſt daughter & principall heare. And thereupon, after many difficulties debated among the Princes, Lords and Subiects of his Realme: hee deliuered her to their hands, who had power to receiue her on your behalfe. but it came to paſſe, that Lord Amadis de Gaule, and diuerſe others his complices, well prouided with ſhipping: lay as ſcouts in the way, aſſayled them in their paſſage, and after a long fight the Prince Saluſte Quide was ſlame, and moſt of the reſt of your people, led as priſoners to the Encloſed Iſle, where (as yet) they detaine Madame Oriana, the Queen Sardamira, and ſame others that were in their company. Notwithſtanding, after-ward, to make amends for the offence committed, they ſent Ambaſſadours to his Maieſty, offring him diuerſe good conditions: which he would not accept before he vnderſtood your minde, becauſe the iniury concerneth you as much or rather more than him. Wherefore he commanded me to tell you, that if you meane to reuenge this wrong, hee will bring a good and ſufficient Army into the field: prouided, that you (for your part) will doe the like. And ſo your powers being ioyned together, he and you ſhall eaſily drawe them to ſuch reaſon, as ſhall bee beſt liking to your ſelues.
                  When the Emperour had heard this, neuer was man in greater choller, and very apparantly he did declare it: for, like one improuident, and vnfurniſhed of all foreſight, he began to ſweare, and (euen) enter into a meere lunacy, ſaying to Guillan, You know what is done, returne to your Maſter, and tell him: I ſhall neuer enioy any reſt, vntill I be ioyned with him, and with ſuch a power, as thoſe Rake-hells of the Encloſed Iſle ſhall well know, how highly they haue offended me. Sir, anſwered Guillan you cannot come ſo ſoone as you ſhall finde the King my Maſter and his Army readie. Haſte home then (anſwered the Emperour) and make no longer tarying here.
                  Thus was Guillan conſtrained to get him gone, without (almoſt) the leaſure of receiuing any ſuſtenance: whereat hee was not a little offended, eſpecially for his ſlender entertainement, and he made no long tarrying from Great Brittaine, to make his complaint thereof to King Liſuart. Beeing embarqued on the Sea, he ſayled directly to Vindiliſore, where hee landed not long after, finding the King there, expecting his ariuall, to whom hee declared all that the Emperour had ſaid, and what ſmall diſcretion hee bewrayed, before ſo many Princes & Lords. And beleeue it Sir (quoth he) vndoubtedly, that if they which come in his company, haue as ſlender braines as hee: neuer were ſeene men more vnmeet for warre, nor worſe gouerned then they will bee.
                  If they will be aduiſed by mee, ſaid the King, I hope wee ſhall not be beaten for want of good guiding: for they beeing mingled among vs, we ſhall both help them, and they vs. It ſhall ſuffice me, that they be ſpeedy in their comming; becauſe I haue this day receiued aduertiſement, that the Emperour of Conſtantinople, and the Kings of Gaule, Scotland, Bohemia and Spaine, doe enter Armes for the ayde of Amadis. I heare alſo, that King Aranigne, with Archalaus and Barſinan, do muſter men from all parts:

but what their intent is I know not, and therefore I holde it conuentent, that wee ſhould firſt bid our enemy battaile, before hee win time to come vpon vs. Which wee may eaſily doe, if they proceede not againſt the Romanes: for Brandoynas is newly ariued from Ireland who aſſureth me, that hee left King Cildadan muſtring his forces, and in forwardneſſe to ioyne with vs. Philipinell likewiſe, is comming home from Suetia, and hath certified mee by his Letters, that King Gaſquilan will not faile to bee here within fifteene dayes, with ſuch a band of worthy Knights, as are ſoundly ſetled in reſolution.
                  As for the reſt, leauied heere at home in mine owne countries, you may ſee (all-ready) more than fiue thouſand, trouping together in the next meddowe: ſo that before a moneth be expired, we ſhall be fully ready for marching hence. But what of Galuanes? ſaid Guillan, is he for you, or no? No, anſwered the King, hee hath entreated mee by Brandonynas, that hee may (at this time) ſtand exempted: Deſiring rather, to redeliuer vp the Iſle of Mongoza into my hands, then to go againſt Amadis and his Nephew. And knowing that in other occaſions hee may doe mee good ſeruice, I am content to holde him excuſed.
                  So, three weekes and more were paſſed ouer, yet no newes heard, either of the Emperour, or of his Armie. Whereat the King was not a little mooued, and fearing that hee would not keep promiſe with him: a Brigandine was preſently prepared, and his Nephew Giontes ſent in all haſte to Rome, to know the cauſe of this delay, and ſo he parted from Vindiliſore.

                     How Graſandor, Sonne to the King of Bohemia, ſayling vpon the Sea met with Giontes: and of that which happened to them.
                  
                  
                     YOu haue already heard that Graſandor hauing taken leaue of the King his father, was ſhipt to Sea, accompanied onely with twenty Knights, ſayling towards the Encloſed Iſle. Earely in a morning, about ſunne riſing, hee diſcouered the Brigandine wherein Giontes was; which foorthwith hee boarded, hauing the winde more at will than the other had. Then Graſandor, being deſirous to know whether hee went, commanded 
                        〈…〉
                      ſhould come before him: for hee had no power of contradiction, becauſe hee had none but Manners aboard with him. Wherefore hee gaue him to vnderſtand, that his voyage was to Rome, thereto enioyned by King Liſuart: entreating that hee might be no longer ſtaied, becauſe his buſineſſe required expedition.
                  
                     Graſandor replied thus. Before God (quoth he) hee that hath ſent you, is no well-wiſher to Lord Amadis, to whom I am an eternall vowed friend: therefore you muſt reli mee your name, and what commiſſion you haue to Rome, otherwiſe you cannot eaſily paſſe from me. If by concealing what you demand, anſwered Giontes, the leaſt iot of the King my maſters honour might be deminiſhed; death could

not compell me to diſcloſe it. But redounding to his fame, with no meane aduantage, & being a matter of no great ſecrecy: know Sir, that my name is Giontes, a Knight of Great Brittaine, and Nephew to the King of whom I ſpake, who hath ſent me to the Emperour, to haſten thoſe forces formerly promiſed him, for his intended warre, againſt them that haue wrongfully ſurpriſed his daughter Oriana, and diuerſe other in her company, vnder conduct of the Prince Saluſte Quide, and other Romanes, whereof ſom were ſlain, & others takē priſoners. Now Sir. hauing thus ſatisfied you, I pray you let me be ſtayed no longer. Goe a Gods name, anſwered Graſandor, and remember, that your King and his Emperour, ſhall ſinde with whom they haue to deale, if they aduenture to aſſaile Amadis, and them that will be in his company.
                  So they parted, Graſandor haſtening towardes the Encloſed Iſle 
                     
                        〈…〉
                      beeing ariued, hee was moſt ioy fulle welcomed, Amadis (and the reſt) entertayning him in moſt 
                        〈…〉
                      manner. Then hee reforted to them, how hee met with G
                           •…
                        tes at Sea, who went to haſten the Emperour of Romes Army, and what other ſpeeches had paſſed between them. Alſo, how the King his father was leuying men in his Kingdome, to follow after him with all poſſible ſpeed, and very ſhortly they were to bee expected, with Count Galtines and Yſario, who ſtayed behinde only for their conduct. In the meane while (quoth hee) I, as one entirely affected to you, am come before, to offer you both my loue and ſeruice. You are moſt heartily welcome, anſwered Amadis, the King your father binds mee more and more, both to him and you, in all I can.
                  Now obſerue how (from that very inſtant) the Army for the Encloſed Iſle gathered ſtrength, and grew compleate within fifteen daies after. For, King Perion ariued there with three thouſand Gaules, all well experienced and hardy warriours: Galtines with fifteen hundred: Tantiles for Queene Briolanis, with 12 hundred: Branfill, brother to Brunes, with ſix hundred. Two thouſand were ſent by Ladaſin, King of Spaine, to his ſonne; and other fifteene hundred came from Scotland, ſent to Agraies: beſides two thouſand which Libeo, Nephew to Maſter Eliſabet, brought from Graſindaes Prouinces, all carrying Turkie Bowes. Eight thouſand likewiſe came vnder the conduct of Gaſtiles, ſent from the Emperour of Conſtantinople; all theſe being encamped on a goodly plaine, hard by the maine Rock of the Encloſed Iſle, couragiouſly expected the enemies comming. And you muſt thinke, that it was a goodly ſight to behold ſo faire an aſſembly, for there was not a man among them, but his very lookes expreſſed the reſolution of his ſoule, and that hee was a warriour indeed which pleaſed Amadis ſo highly, as nothing could more content him.
                  But the Princeſſe Oriana, thinking continually on ſuch miſchances as might enſue in ſuch caſes, had euermore her eyes filled with tears, refuſing all comfort that came from the women: wherewith Mabila acquainted Amadis, who was not a little grieued thereat. And ſeeing he had no better meanes to delight her, then to preſent before her eyes, how many valiant men had vnder-taken Armes in her defence: hee ſent to entreate her, that ſhe would bee pleaſed to behold them on the

morrowe, all ordered in the forme of a maine battell, and therefore ſecretly gaue the alarum, which ſhe and the other Ladies accepted verie pleaſingly. For, from their windowes, they could diſcerne all the field, & Amadis (in the night time) had cloſely ambuſhed an hundred men, and three hundred Harquebuziers to confront them, ſayling all along the Sea ſhoar, and about ten of the clock the next morning, they entred into skirmiſh, the Allarum being giuen on either ſide.
                  The morning (after ſunne-riſing) prooued very foggie and miſtie, ſo that the Ladies could not diſcerne any of the ſport: but after that the ſunne had ſcattered the miſts, then the warriours ranged their battalions, and the Harquebuziers plaied hotly with their ſhotte, ſo that the Scouts and Centinells (fearing to bee ſurpriſed on either ſide) made their eſcapes queint and cunning. Then was the whole campe ſo moued, euen as if the heauens had thū
                     dered, by the noiſe of Drummes, Trumpets, and Clarions, cheerfully ſounding on euery ſide. And as they laboured for winning of Enſines, the men appeared like Ants, very properly ſtealing abroad forth of their earth, where all ſummer they made their prouiſion for winter▪ In the meane while, the Ladies were (on all ſides) at their gazing windowes, beholding this militarie controuerſie; which ſerued as a pleaſing paſſe-time to them, by reaſon of the intelligence Amadis had giuen them thereof the day before.
                  As thus they were pell mell together, Mabila with a very gracious reſpect, came to Oriana, ſpeaking thus. By my faith Madame, there are many great Princes and Potentates, who haue not ſuch plenty of men at command, as you haue: I referre my ſelfe to this inſtant ſpectacle before your eyes. What ſay you yourſelfe? Is it not true? How happy then were you, in making due conſideration hereof, and how much you can command in him, to whom this whole Army affordeth obedience? I am perſwaded that if King Liſuart, and the Emperour (which neuer ſhal be your husband) did but beholde what you now doe: they would conſider twice on their enterpriſe, before they ventured any further forth of their countries. Wherefore it is no more then neceſſarie, that hence-forward you ſhould refraine your ſighes & tears, and ſhew a much more cheerefull diſpoſition, then hitherto you haue done.
                  Deare Coſen, anſwered Orania, it is impoſſible for mee to be pleaſantly humoured, when I conſider mine owne inſtant miſerie. For well you know, that if the King my fathers power, and this belonging to your kinſman, doe but once ioyne or meete together: it will prooue to the ruine of the one or other, or (perhaps) of both together. Which were an vnrecouerable miſchiefe to me, as well for the dutie which nature commandeth in mee to my father, as alſo the affection I beare to Amadis. How then can I any way haue cōtentment? would God I were deade, rather than I ſhould liue to ſee ſuch mighty inconueniences. With theſe words, the teares ſtreamed aboundantly from her faire eyes. Why how now Madame? ſaide Mabila, doe you thinke that our Lord hath forgotten you? I dare promiſe you, hee will no more leaue you now, then hitherto hee hath done, if you repoſe your truſt in him. For your innocence is generally knowne, and that (againſt your will) this great a doe

hath beene begun: therefore, neuer grieue your ſelfe ſo much, becauſe it may fall out the worſe for you, and be offenſiue likewiſe to my noble Coſen, and all the other worthie Knights, who deſire nothing more than to doe you ſeruice.
                  All this while, King Perion (ſince his ariuall) had not ſeene the Princeſſe Oriana; wherefore, after this pleaſant battaile was ended, he demanded of Agraies, if hee could compaſſe the meanes to ſpeak with her, becauſe hee would gladly doe her reuerence. Agraies made him anſwere, that hee would worke the way for him: and preſently went to the Princeſſe, acquainting her with King Perions deſire. Hee ſhall be moſt graciouſly welcome (quoth ſhe) whenſoeuer it pleaſeth him to come. But deare Coſen, what is your opinion of my misfortunes. Am not I the moſt vnhappy creature in the world, to ſee ſo many great Princes and good Knights troubled, and all about my buſineſs? Madame, ſaid hee, we are all yours, and there is not a man among vs, that will not gladly (& with a good heart) be employed in your ſeruice, and all account their paines ſufficiently rewarded, if you but vouchſafe to accept it. Alas Sir, anſwered ſhe, I know not how I ſhal any way be thankfull to you all, for this great grace: but I will entreate our Lord to requite it. Madame, replied Agraies, if you diſlike not what wee doe, & would be a little more cheerfully humorous then hitherto you haue been; you ſhould binde vs all in much more dutie to you. Beleeue it Coſen (quoth ſhee) I will 
                        〈◊〉
                      with my pa

                      much as poſſibly I can. And becauſe I vnderſtand, that the 
                        〈◊〉
                      to the King of

                     riued: I pray you to let him come along with King Perion.
                  
                  So Agraies tooke leaue of her, and went to ſeeke the King of Gaule and Graſſandor, to whom hee declared; that Oriana attended their cō
                     ming, and that they ſhould be moſt kindly welcome. Wherefore, without any further delaying, they went vnto her, accompanied with Amadis, Floreſtan, and diuerſe others. Entring into the Princeſſe chamber, ſhee attended on by the other Ladies and Gontlewomen, went to entertaine them: And then King Perion, who had not ſeene or ſpoken to her, ſince ſhee aboad with the Queene of Scots, demanded of her, whether ſhee knew him, or no. My Lord (quoth ſhe) although I neuer ſaw you more then once, yet I do well remember the requeſt you granted mee, when you made your ſonne Amadis Knight. It is true, anſwered the King, and ſeeing you were the cauſe of the firſt honour that euer he receiued: I hold it reaſonable that hee ſhould bee thankfull therefore to you, ſo long as he enioyeth life.
                  While thus they talked together, Graſſandor conferred with Mabila, whom hee found ſo diſcreetly wiſe, and endued with ſuch ſingular graces: as (thence forward) he grew enamoured of her, ſo that he married her, as you ſhall read hereafter. In the meane ſpace, Queen Briolania diſcourſing with Quedragant, ſhee ſaid vnto him. Sir, but for our former intelligence of your mornings battaile, neuer had women beene in the like terrour and amazement. How Madame? anſwered Quedragant, was it more dreadfull, then the late attempt of your Coſen Tiron? No by my faith, ſaid ſhee, for then I expected nothing elſe but death, and but for you, I had been in the greateſt danger,

that euer could happen to any Lady or Gentlewoman: but thanks be to God, and your good ſuccor. I now haue time to be fully reuenged. Madame, ſaide Brian, your beauty and vertue doe plainely deliuer, that you haue no power to take any ſuch reuenge as you ſpeak of: but rather ſpeakes pardon in the faireſt language, and preſumes of more loyalty in him hereafter, then precedent times haue warranted from him. Truely Sir (quoth ſhe) I could well like of ſo good an inclination in him, and if you think it meet, wee will ſend for him immediately, to vnderſtand how his minde is affected: aſſuring you, that it would be no little ioy to me, if I could kindly reconcile him; in regarde he is young, my very neare kinſman, and of better ſpirit (as I thinke) then euer was in his father, or other brethren. Madame, replied Brian, you could neuer ſpeake more vertuouſly, then now you do: I pray you ſend for him, to the end (if hee ſtand ſo addicted) hee may promiſe fidelity to you, in the preſence of ſo many good Knights as now are here. It liketh me well, anſwered ſhe, for hee is priſoner to you two, and none of mine, and therefore diſpoſe of him as you pleaſe.
                  Inſtantly was Tiron ſent for, who being come before ſo great a company, expected no other arreſt then death: and therefore was not a little amazed, when hee heard Briolania thus ſpeake to him. Tiron theſe two Gentlemen (whom you know well enough) haue entreated mee to ſhew you mercy, and I am well enclined thereto, neuer minding the treaſon of your deceaſed father againſt me: prouided, that you deliberate, and promiſe mee, hence-forward to follow vertue as zealouſly, as your life hither to hath beene lewde and wicked. Alſo to make amends for the wrong you haue done mee, and endeauour to become a loyall & faithfull ſeruant: and doing ſo, I will not vſe you as a priſoner, but as my Coſen and neareſt kinſman. Therefore tell mee preſently (without any diſſimulation) how you ſtand reſolued: for, being iſſued from the royall blood of a King, you ſhould highly ſhame your ſelfe, to deliuer now ſuch wordes, as hereafter ſhould not be effectually performed.
                  Alas Madame, quoth hee, if you pleaſe to take pitty on me, while I liue I will neuer more offend you: and therfore I moſt humbly entreat you, euen (for Gods ſake) to forgiue mee. As for my fathers tranſgreſſions, I cannot yeeld you any reaſon for them: conſidering I was then ſo young, as all remembrance of him is quite bereft me. But for mine owne particular, I proteſt and promis to you Madam that I wil be iuſt & faithfull to you, if you pleaſe to forget my former errour towards you, which rather was the guilt of my youth, then any other willing ſinne. If you doe as you ſay, anſwered ſhe, it will proue the better for you. What I promiſe Madame, replied Tiron, I ſolemnely ſweare vnto. Nor did he euer faile therein, and therfore it fell out to both their great honours.
                  
                     Briolania extending ſuch mercy to her enemy, and hee no leſſe man-hood to her, may ſerue for an example to many; in beeing leſſe prompt and forwarde to reuenge, then their cruell nature doth prouoke them. And now returning to our former purpoſe, Tiron beeing thus reconciled to the Queene, and and ſhee deſirous to declare, what truſt ſhe would repoſe in him, vpon

this new agreement, ſaid vnto him. Coſen it is my minde, that you take charge and conduct of thoſe forces which Tantiles hath cauſed to come hither from my countries: you ſhal be their chiefe commander, and they as obedient to you, as to my ſelfe. Tiron refuſed not this honorable 
                        〈◊〉
                     , but accepted it in moſt humble manner.
                  As thus they reſolued, King Perion and the reſt tooke leaue of the Ladies, returning back to the camp, where they met with Balays de Carſanta, who was newly there ariued, accompanied with twenty Knights all his kinſemen, whom hee had brought to doe ſeruice to Amadis, as hauing heard before of his vrgent neceſſity. Here you muſt obſerue, that this Balays was hee who parted him and his brother Galaor, when firſt they fought together, by the meanes of the Damoſell, who needs would haue the head of Arda

He alſo paſſed by Vindiliſore, to note King Liſuarts Army, giuing aſſurance, that the Romanes were there arriued, and Gaſquilan King of Suetia, with a great number of Knights. Report likewiſe was credibly enformed, that the camp would diſlodge thence within fifteene dayes at the vttermoſt, and then march directly towards the Encloſed Iſle: wherfore king Perion determined, to preuent him by the way, and bid him battaile firſt.

                  Well knew King Liſuart, that the Emperour could not command his paſſions, but would offer outrage to Enill, except hee preuented it, whereat hee was not a little offended: and therefore to breake off their further difference, he ſaid to the Emperour. My Lord, let vs ſit downe to dinner, and leaue this meſſenger to enioy his priuiledge. So departed both the Princes,

Where Arquiſil found himſelfe not a little amazed, to ſee ſuch an hoaſt of men aſſembled together: neuertheleſſe, hee concealed his cogitations, and alighted at the Pauillion of Amadis, who, after hee had demanded tydings of the Emperours Campe, and his intentions, ſpake vnto him. Lord Arquiſill, your Maſter is a great Prince and powerfull: yet hee may finde (if he come to aſſayle vs) that hee will be more manly anſwered, than hee perſwades King Liſuart hee ſhall be. And becauſe you may the better beleeue my wordes: before we

                     Amadis beeing very deſirous to let all men perceiue, how little hee ſtood in doubt of the Emperour, or any helpe that Arquiſill could giue him, returned him this anſwer. Arquiſill, although the Emperour your Maſter is too lauiſh of his tongue, and ouer▪ glorious and preſumptuous without any occaſion: yet notwithſtanding, being not willing (at this time) to reuenge my ſelfe on him by any means of yours, I am content to giue you libertie, and that you ſhall be with him on the day of battaile. Vpon condition, if you ſcape with life: you ſhall come againe to mee on the tenth day following, in any place whereſoeuer I am, to doe ſuch ſeruice as I ſhall command you. For which fauour Arquiſill moſt humbly thanked him, ſwearing on the Kings hand, that hee would keepe his promiſe faithfully: and beeing very earneſt in deſire for his return, taking leaue of all the company, hee mounted on horſe-back, and without any ſtay in any place, came to the Emperours Camp, who was not a little ioyfull of his returne, demanding by what meanes he thus eſcaped.

                     How Gandalin, Squire to Amadis, and Lafinde, Squire to Bruneo de bone Mer, were made Knights: And of the battaile betweene the two Kings, Liſuart and Perion.
                     
                  
                  
                     WE haue declared here-tofore, that Gandalin had order giuen him by Amadis (paſſing into Gaule) to entreate the Queene his mother, to ſend Melitia, to keep company with Oriana, which King Perion wel allowed of: but beholding Galaor ſtill ſo ſickly, ſhe was loath ſhee ſhould depart▪ vntill he were a little ſtronger. Wherefore Gandalin remained there for her conduct, ſo ſoon as Galaors danger were paſt, which happened within a ſhort while after. Hereupon, the Queene cauſed her to bee embarked, well accompanied with Ladies and Gentlewomen, hoping ſhee ſhould (as yet) finde King Perion in the Encloſed Iſle. But he was departed thence before her ariuall, to the no little griefe of Gandalin, becauſe he hoped to receiue his Knighthood before the battell ſhould be fought: & therfore, becauſe he might the ſooner attain therto, he departed thēce, and (without ſtaying in any place) ceaſed not til

Hee findes himſelfe (anſwered Gandalin) in much better eſtate, then formerly hee did: but yet continueth ſo weake, as hee is not able to leaue his Chamber, and come into the open ayre.
                  Afterward, hee reported all that to him, which you haue heard alreadie, and ſaid. Beleeue me Gandalin, thy rydings doe not pleaſe mee a little, and I am glad thou art returned in ſo apt a ſeaſon, in regard (I hope) wee ſhall haue the battaile, before three dayes be fully expired. That made me make ſuch haſte, replyed Gandalin; for you knowe my earneſt deſire to bee knighted, and I can neuer receiue it at a more conuenient time, nor euer ſhew my ſelfe worthie of ſo great an honor as now. And credit me my Lord, that but for the knowledge I now haue, of your eaſre ſparing mee, hauing Madame Oriana in your owne power: I would not haue vſed theſe ſpeeches. Wherefore, moſt humbly I deſire you to grant mee, that this battaile may not bee fought, vntill I may bee comprehended therein, and that I may reach my longing expectation.

So marched the two Armies each againſt other, and on the third day following, they came in ſight halfe a mile off: and there encamped, performing many aduenterous skirmiſhes, as well on horſebacke, as on foot: eſpecially the Romanes, who ſtill preſſed them of the Encloſed Iſle to fight, becauſe they found the place aduantageable for them. But King Perion vnderſtood their meaning well enough, fortefying his Campe with great trenches, & defending all paſſages with his artilery Thus they maintained them-ſelues three daies together, skirmiſhing (well-neare) from morning to night: and longer time they had thus temporiſed, but that they receiued information, how Archalaus had induced King Aranigne, to the leuying of a powerfull Army, and marched on ſpeedily to encounter with them.
                  Hereupon, the two Camps grew iealous of one another, not knowing to whether ſide they inclined: for King Liſuart imagined they came in ayde of Amadis, and Amadis preſumed the like for King Liſuart, and this was their onely motiue of their falling to fight, according as you ſhall heare hereafter. But before it came ſo to paſſe, Gaſquilan, King of Swetia, who had expreſſely left his courtrie to fight with Amadis: ſent a Trompet to him, who being come into his preſence, ſpake in this manner. Lord Amadis, the King of Swetia my Maſter, ſends you worde by mee, that at ſuch time as King Liſuart vndertook the warre, againſt Galuaues in the Iſle of Mongoza: he then departed from his kingdome, with intention onely, to approue his manhood againſt you; not for any hatred or malice hee beares you, but onely in regarde of your great

fame and renowne. And being no way able to meet with you, he was enforced (being then wounded) to returne home againe, fruſtrated of his expectation. And hee had not now left his owne lande againe, but that hee was aduertiſed by King Liſuart, of your vndertaking this hardy enterpriſe. And continuing ſtill in his former deliberation, hee entreates you (in meere curteſie) that to morrowe you would breake three Lances with him: for if you delay it till the day of battaile, hardly ſhall you approue your ſelues each againſt other, according to his honourable deſire.
                  
                     Trompet anſwered Amadis, I haue long ſince heard of this which thou telleſt me, and of thy Maſters earneſt deſire, and doe alſo verily beleeue, that it proceeds from true magnanimity of ſpirit in him. Now although there is great difference betweene my actions, and the fame noyſed abroad of mee: yet I am well contented, that hee ſhould holde ſuch reputation of me, as he doth, and knowing him to bee no leſſe then he is, I could rather wiſh, that his proofe of mee might be in ſome ſuch place, where hee might receiue more ſeruice by me. My Lord, ſaid the Trompet, he well remembers, how matters paſt between you and Madraque, the Giant of the Sadde Iſland, and albeit they concerned him ſomewhat neare as a ſonne to a father: yet being aduertiſed of the curteſie you extended towards him, hee reputeth you rather worthie of commendation, then any manner of reuenge. So this deſire in him, of triall with you, is not for any enui

                  before we paſſe any further, I wil reporte the principall cauſe, which mooued this great Prince Gaſquilan, to trauaile through ſo many countries, onely to approoue him ſelfe againſt Amadis. In the third Booke of our Hiſtory hath been related to you, that he was the ſo

Afterward, he fell in loue with a yong and beautifull Princeſſe, named Pinela, who was both an heire and orphane, by death of her father and mother, and many lands & Seigneuries, bordering and adioyning to them of Gaſquilin, belonged to her as her right and inheritance.
                  His extreamity in affection to her, prouoked him to vndertake many bolde aduentures, which hee worthily effected, not without great perill to his perſon: neuerth

She lent ſuch liking to this perſwaſion, that at one time (among many other) Gaſquilan vſing his wonted opportunities, with goodly diſcourſe & proteſtations, as louers in like afflictions can eaſily performe: ſhe as a Lady diſcreet and quicke of apprehenſion, anſwered him in this manner.
                  My Lord, ſeeing Heauen hath endowed mee with ſuch riches as I now enioy; no dread of danger, or of death it ſelfe, can make mee falſifie the promiſe I made to my deceaſed father: which was, neuer to marrie, but vpon one eſpeciall condition. What was that? ſayde Gaſquilan. I ſolemnely ſwore (quoth ſhe) to him before hee died, neuer to ioyne in marriage, but with the beſt Knight in the world, if it lay in my power to winne him; and although he were neuer ſo poore, yet I would haue no other huſband. Hereupon I made diligent inquiſition, who might be this only man of men, and haue receiued credible intelligence, that Amadis de Gaule cannot be ſeconded: wherfore, if you dare make hazard of your manhoode, and vanquiſh him, you ſhall enioy your earneſt deſire. This only occaſion incited Gaſquilan, to vndertake thoſe two voyages, which hee made into Great Brittaine, preſuming ſo much vpon his valour, that hee ſhould haue the vpper hand of Amadis.
                  
                  The Trompet beeing come backe to Gaſquilan, declared vnto him the whole anſwer of his meſſage: wherat Gaſquilan was ſo ioyfull, that he deliuered theſe wordes ſo lowde, as all by might eaſily heare him. Before God, Trompet, I would not now wiſh to be maſter of the faireſt Citie in Gaule, in exchange of this long looked for happineſſe: for I hope to make it apparantly known, that I am a little more worthie then hee. So, imagining the time too ouer-long, the next morning, by breake of day, hee put on a gray Armour, couered with golden Griffons, holding a bleeding hart in their tallons, as teſtimony of the torments he endured in loue. Then comming before the Emperor and King Liſuart, hee earneſtly entreated them to come ſee how he could abate the glory of Amadis. And if (quoth hee) I vn-horſe him not at the firſt encounter, I am content to beare no Armes for a whole year together. But the Emperour who had ſufficient experience of Amadis, was of another minde, and therfore ordered the greater part of his power in forme of battaile, as well for his owne ſecurity: as doubting ſome ſudden ſurpriſall, vnder the colour of this particuler Combate; and the like did Agraies on the other ſide.
                  The two auantguards being thus each before other, Amadis hauing put on a green Armour, thickely powdred with Lions of gold (euen ſuch another as he wore when hee came to his Oriana at Mirefleure, at his returne from the poore Rocke, when hee ſlew the two Giants, Famongomad and Baſigant his ſonne) called for Gandalin, and ſaide vnto him. Gandalin, ſeeing thou wilt not haue thy knighthood from a Kings hand: goe Arme thy ſelfe, and before I enter into this Combate, I will perform what I haue promiſed thee. So Gandalin departed, and ſoon after returned againe to Amadis, who attended there for him,

and taking him by the hand, conducted him to King Perion, ſpeaking thus. Sir, heere is Gandalin, who deſires to haue his order of knighthood. wherefore moſt humbly I deſire you, in regarde hee will needs receiue it of me; you would be pleaſed to gird on his ſword, that hee may remember (ſo long as hee liues) the honour you gaue him. With theſe wordes, hee preſented him one of thoſe Swordes, which Queen Menoreſſa had giuen him at Conſtintinople, and had remained in the cuſtody of Durin, brother to the Damoſell of Denmarke. Then giuing him the accolade, and putting on his right ſpurre: the King next came, and girded on his Sword, & ſo he receiued this high honour, by the hands of the two beſt Knights in the world. At which time likewiſe, Bruneo did as much for Laſinde, whoſe Sword was girded on by Agraies.
                  
                  This being thus done, Amadis went forth of his troupes, becauſe Gaſquilan was attending for him vpon the plaine, and each of them hauing a mighty ſtrong launce placed in his reſt: gaue the ſpurre to their horſes, and met together with ſuch violence, that their ſtaues flew in ſhi

And albeit Amadis was ſhrewdly ſhaken, in the ſhock, & his horſe ſhouldred: yet hee made meanes to allight before his fall, & drawing forth his Sword, marched therewith againſt Gaſquilan, who continued (as yet) ſo amazed, as he appeared not to moue a ioynt.
                  Hereupon, the Emperour miſdoubting that hee would haue ſmitten off his head; cauſed

Then it fell to them that could doe beſt on both ſides, for the vaun
                        •
                     guards marched againſt each other, & the great Ordenance played without any intermiſſion. In the meane ſpace, Amadis haſtened on the maine battaile, and the rereguarde, and cauſed Bruneo, to iſſue forth with three hundred horſe, to charge a troupe of the Romaines, who defended ſix great Culuerins, which King Liſuart had placed neer at hand, and did much harme to the foot-men. But hee carried himſelfe with ſuch vndaunted courage, that hauing put the enemy in route, he became Maſter of that Artillery.
                  By this time the two Armies had paced very neere, and beeing vpon the point of ſight, Drummes and Trumpets ſounded cheerfully, and the foot-men performing their office of ſeruice, marched on with their Pikes croſſed, to reſiſt the horſe-mens entrance: while the Harquebuziers and Archers made two ſharpe charges, wherein Quedragant was wounded in the left arme. But comming all to ioyne, the noyſe exceeded admiration, to heare the breaking of Launces, Pikes and Halbardes, ſounding like a great tempeſt of haile, falling on a houſe couered with tile or ſmooth ſlate. There might you haue ſeene many braue men ouerthrowen on the ground, ſome deadly wounded, others wallowing in their blood, diſmembred of legges and armes: the fight continued long in this

dreadfull manner, before it could any way be diſcerned, whether ſide had the better or worſe: for Floran ruſhing in vpon the Gaules, made ſuch a ſlaughter among them, as he let not a ſtroake fall, but valued a life.
                  While this bloody fury endured, Amadis and his troupes, charged the Emperours vauntguard, and when it came to the Launces breaking, Gandalin, who was one of the formoſt, met the brother to Arquiſill, and brake their Launces each on other, but the Romane was diſmounted. Now they entred pell mell, and they that had ſeen Agraies follow his buſineſſe, would haue thought him to bee one of the beſt Knights in the worlde: for, before hee loſt his Launce, hee vnhorſed foure of the Emperors beſt knights. And here was the fierce heat of the conflict, becauſe the Emperours Harquebuziers, who were conducted by Arquiſill thwarted the horſe-men of Amadis: and but for Branful and Tiron, who came and accoſted them with their light horſe, they had done them much more harme than they did. But they brake ſo violently vppon them, as they could no way charge them, but fell into diſorder; albeeit Arquiſill foūd meanes to rallie them againe in good manner.
                  
                     Agraies Landin, & Angriote d'Eſtreueus being ioyned together, reſiſted the Romanes with wonderfull boldnes, each man pretending victory to his ſide: and Amadis with ſome other Gaules, entred the midſt of the preſſe, making ſuch hauocke among them, as no man durſt abide before them. There they met with

Then mette together the Romanes and Gaules, to ſuccour and helpe ſuch as were ouerthrowne, and beleeue it for a certaintie, that many loſt their liues in this hotte charge, by reaſon the Emperour came in vpon them, accompanied with many noble Knights. But hee found his purpoſe ſoone diſapointed, and before his face, the Gouernour of Calabria was ſlaine by Amadis, who perceiuing Agraies and Angriote to bee on foote in the throng, and in very great danger: laboured ſo manfully, as he quickly gaue them ſuccour, by the helpe of Gandalin, Laſinde, Granate of the Dreadfull Dale, and Bruneo.
                  
                  Hereupon, the Gaules, who were halfe ſpent and tired, tooke heart againe, and then began the Romanes to diſmay, falling into diſorder, and flying directly toward King Liſuart, who followed the maine battalion: and but for Floyan, and ſome other of the nobler ſpirits, who maintained the aſſault (holding out couragiouſly euery way, while the foot-men returned againe to battaile) not a man had eſcaped aliue. For Quedragant and his ſquadron charged them ſo violently, as they had not ſo much leaſure as to bethinke themſelues what to doe. But when they ſaw the power of King Liſuart ſo neare, they held out the battaile: againſt the forces of King Perion, the troupes of Gaſtiles, and the Archers of Libeo, playing hottly ſtill on them.
                  Now began night to draw neare, and King Liſuart well peceiued, that retrait was more commodious

for him, then enduring the fight any further, eſpecially that day, wherefore, without attending the other powers, he withdrew the head of his Armie into his fort, and King Perion continued impalled in his camp, euen where the conflict had beene maintained, the watch and guardes on either ſide well apointed, intending the next day to fight for victory. But about two houres within night, a Trompet belonging to the Emperour and King Liſuart, was taken by the ſcoutes, as he came to craue truce for foure and twenty houres onely, which was yeelded vnto.

                     AFter that the truce was expired, the two Campes, beganne to march each againſt the other; and becauſe both the vantguardes had endured much trouble on the day of battell, they were appointed to the re

                     eguard, and the maine battaile went in their place. Thus both the Kings, Perion and Liſuart, were before, and after that the Artillery had long time played, and done great harme on either ſide, the band of foote, conducted by Norandell, came to encounter them ledde by Gaſtiles. Here now began a wonderfull conflict, & ſo many worthie men were ſlaine, as it was moſt lamentable to beholde. For, as King Liſuart marched on the one ſide, with intent to encloſe the battaile of Gaſtiles: hee met with the Archers ledde by Libeo, who making no ſpare of their cunning, their arrowes flew ſo thicke in the aire, that they ſeemed like a ſwarme of Bees, fledde from their hi
                        •
                     e, to ſeeke their abyding ſome where elſe. By meanes where-of, many of their enemies were ſore wounded, and their horſes ſhrewdly endangered, King Perion following after them with his troupes.
                  Now began the Drummes and Trumpets to ſound chearefully on each ſide, and the noyſe was ſo terrible, as if they had heard the heauens thunder: for ſome cryed Gaul, Gaule, others Spaine, Scotland, Ireland, Bohemia, and ſo euery man extolling his owne countrie, as the vſually doe in ſuch warlike actions. But when they came to fight with their Swords, neuer was ſeeene ſo many horſes wounded as then, becauſe euery one ſtroue who ſhould moſt flanke and hough them, and the duſt roſe ſo aboundantly, as the ayre became to be darkened thereby. Then Amadis, who led the battaile, ſet onward, becauſe hee was aduertiſed, that the Emperour proceeded on mainely with his troups: whereupon hee ſent to tell Quedragant, that he ſhould diuide his foot, and to Brian and Sadomon, to march neare with their ſupplies, if the other ſhould be diſtreſſed, and that Branfill, with his light horſe, ſhould charge on the baggage belonging to King Liſuart.
                  
                  On the other ſide, the Emperor, who had receiued intelligence, what mighty harme the Archers did in the vantguarde, to King Liſuarts men, and fearing leaſt they

could not long hold out, againſt the ſharpe charges of King Perion: ſent to Arquiſill, that he ſhould accoſte them, & that Conſtant with his Harquebuziers, ſhould come vpon the rere of their enemies. Notwithſtanding, they were much deceiued in their hope, becauſe inſtantly they ſaw the maine battaile, conducted now by Amadis, ſo neare vpon them: that they were conſtrained to flock together, only to maintain the preſent fight, and ioyned ſoon after with the two rereguardes. For Madacan, who had executed his enterpriſe ſo farre as hee could, gaue out publiquely, that the Romanes were in flight: and this he ſpake, becauſe hee ſaw a troupe, of horſe iſſue forth of the rereguarde, which Cildadan had ſent out, for the reſcue of their baggage. Madacan obſeruing this, and that his troupe was not ſtrong enough: they all retired with a maine gallop, ſo that the very terrour thereof, brake the foot which was led by Brandoynas. And now both the Armies entred fight pell mell, performing ſuch admirable deedes of armes, as no men poſſible could doe more, and furie on both ſides ſo mightily encreaſed, that thereon enſued an inincredible ſlaughter.
                  During this conflict, Brian, who was followed by his Spaniards, met with Arban, King of Norwales, and they charged one another ſo violently, as they little failed from being vnhorſed. Then came King Liſuart with Grumedan, who carried his Enſigne, and other Knights of Great Brittaine ſeconded them, who brought Brian into ſuch a ſtraite: as if hee had not ſpeedily been ſupplied by Agraies & Floreſtan, hee had been taken, but their ſuccour came ſo conueniently, as their enemies were glad to recoile. Neuertheleſſe K. Liſuart had ouer-thrown Dragonis, & wold haue ſlain him: but that Agraies ſteping between thē, cried out aloud. Diſhonorable King, turne thy face to me, for thou ſhalt die by the hand of Agraies, who hates thee more, then any man liuing. Thus ſpeaking, he gaue him ſuch a powerfull ſtroke on the helmet, as made fire to ſparkle in his eyes, and leauing his ſword hanging at a chaine faſtened about his arme; caught him faſt by the middle, and ſo ſtrictly, as hee had almoſt borne him downe to the ground. But King Liſuart likewiſe got as faſt holde on him, and each ſtroue manfully againſt the other, who ſhould haue the beſt aduantage of his enemy, by cleane ſtrength.
                  As thus they contended together, King Perion chanced to ſpy them, and beeing followed by Landin, Floreſtan, and a great troupe of his people: drew neare to helpe Agraies, and to take King Liſuart, if hee could. Purſuing his enterpriſe, hee met with Giontes, Grumedan, and a great many more, who charged him very fiercely. And here you may be well aſſured, that there was not only ſharpe aſſailing, but likewiſe as manfull defending: ſome beeing grieuouſly wounded, others ſlaine outright, and many troden to death among the horſes feet. For King Cildadan came freſhly in vpon them, with a great number of his Iriſhmen, and Gaſtiles alſo ſo well accompanied, as heere now was the maine violence of the battaile, becauſe both the horſe and foot were mingled together. Neuertheleſſe, King Liſuarts ſide foūd themſelues ſorely oppreſſed, by reaſon that Amadis, Laſinde, Gandalin, Balays, Landin, and diuerſe others their followers, charged them

in the rere, and had driuen them to flight; but for Floyan, who ſhouldred vppe the re-enforce of the Romanes, by him freſhly rallied together againe.
                  Notwithſtanding, this hotte reſiſtance laſted not long, for Amadis meeting with Floyan, ſlew him in the Emperours preſence: who hoping to reuenge his death, ranne in vpon Amadis, who knowing him well enough, & redoubling his ſtrength, only in the hatefull ſpleene he bore him, as the Emperour lifted vp his arme, with intent to ſmite him on the head: Amadis aymed at him ſo directly, that hitting iuſt in the ſhoulder ioynt, hee parted it quite from his body, and the griefe therof was ſo violent to him, that inſtantly hee fell downe dead to the ground. By meanes whereof, the Romanes growing into great terrour and diſmay, began to turne their backes, flying away ſo confuſedly, as neither King Arban, or any other, beſide, had power to ſtay them, what-ſoeuer good wordes they ſpake vnto them.
                  Now did King Liſuart apparantly perceiue, that Fortune ſtood not fauourable for him and his that day, and the loſſe of the battaile could not bee auoided: yet notwithſtanding, deſiring rather to die with his ſword in his fiſt, than to ſaue life by a ſhamefull flight, hee would needes enter in among the preaſe, but King Arban ſtaying him, ſpake thus. Alas Sir, loſe not your life deſperately, and with your owne conſent: Will you fight alone againſt a whole Armie? doe you not ſee the Romanes in a confuſed diſorder, and the moſt parte of our owne men diſcomfited? Oh let it pleaſe you to retire, and ſaue the reſt, with whom wee may (at ſome other time) better deale with the enemy, then now we can doe. Wel knew King Liſuart that he ſpake no otherwiſe then true, wherefore, while his people retired, he & ſuch as hee could beſt aſſure: remained ſtill vpon the rere, defending them-ſelues againſt all purſute.
                  Slender warrant of ſafety had this beene to him, or them, but for Amadis, who foreſeeing what diſcontent it would bee to Oriana, if the King her father ſhould be vnterly foyled: ſaid to King Perion. My Lord, our enemies flie, I pray you (without arther hazarding our owne fortune) let vs content our ſelues with the honour wee haue already this day receiued: for if wee purſue on after him, darke night will ouertake vs, and it may bee, like deſperate men in reuenging their great loſſe, wee may fall into no meane danger. Leaue them then to their owne ſhame, and let vs retreat our owne men, that are ouer ſpent and wearie. Be it ſo anſwered King Perion. How? ſaid Agrates, now that victory ſweetely preſents herſelfe vnto vs, ſhall wee willfully refuſe her? By God, deare Coſen, you are well worthie to be no better accounted of, then as filly Knight errant. Would you (replied Amadis) haue your men murder one another, for lack of others to fight withall? Is not the Sunne ſet, and night ſo neare, as if wee ſhould holde on any further in fight, wee ſhall not knowe our enemies from our friends: I pray you Sir, let vs reſt thus ſatisfied.
                  Well knew Agraies, to what end Amadis made this excuſe: wherefore, without vrging any further reply, in great choller hee turned bridle, and gallopt on the other ſide, becauſe Amadis had cauſed retreate to be ſounded. Then euery man fell backe and King Perions Armie encamped

in the ſame place where they had fought, as a ſignall of victory, hoping the next day to finiſh finally what they had begunne. But ſoon after, an Heralde came to demanded the the Emperours bodie, and another truce for foure daies, during which time they might bury their dead. It was conſented vnto, contrary to the opinion of many, but onely by the meanes of Amadis.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. XIX.
                  
                     Of the conference which King Liſuart had with the Romanes, after the fought battaile. And how the holy man Naſcian, who had nouriſhed Eſplandian in his younger yeares, hearing of this warre, departed from his Hermitage, to come to the two Kings to make peace betweene them.
                  
                  
                     THe truce confirmed, as formerly hath been ſaid, King Liſuart gaue commande, that the Emperors body ſhold be brought, with the greateſt magnificence that could be deuiſed, and ſo to be placed in his owne Tent. Now becauſe hee ſtood in ſome feare, that the Romanes would fight no more, becauſe their chiefe commander was dead: hee reſolued to ſpeake vnto them, as well to encourage them, as to vnderſtand how they were affected. Hereupon, the day following, hee ſent to entreat Arquiſill, that hee would conduct them in order of battaile, for their better apprehending what hee had to ſay vnto them. Whereunto Arquiſill gladly condiſcended, and hauing aſſembled them in a goodly meadow, King Liſuart came vnto them, and placing himſelfe in the middle ſquadron, ſpake as followeth.
                  Honorable and worthie friends, you haue ſeene and experimented in theſe two encounters, how Fortune hath ſhowen herſelfe our heauie enemy: ſo that in beſtowing her frownes on vs, ſhee triumphes in the death of my kinde brother, and your royall Maſter, beſides many other valiant Knights, who by effects (in ſeeking reuenge on his enemies) were willing to finde what they ſought for, becauſe it was the very faireſt experience they could make of their vertue, for gaining the glory they haue aſpired vnto. And for their better attaining thereto, the hazard of their liues ſeemed as a matter of no moment vnto them: but that it was much more honourable, to die in defending themſelues valiantly, thē to eſcape by a ſhamefull recoile. So that, to auoide falling into ſuch a high diſhonour, they rather gladly deſired, by expreſſing the very greateſt magnanimity of courage, to endure Fortune, then yeeld to feare. Nor doe I hereby vrge any taxation againſt them that haue eſcaped with life, knowing well, how worthily they haue all carried themſelues: but rather to entreate them, that in preferring honour, before ſorrow, for the loſſe of your friends & companions; you would eſſay (the truce being ended) to reuenge their misfortune, fighting couragiouſly againſt them, who ſwell in heart too proudly of their victory.
                  
                     
I am verily perſwaded, that wee ought no leſſe expoſe our ſelues to hazards and dangers, then if wee had preuailed againſt them, as they haue done againſt vs; nor to declare any abatement of courage, either in aſſayling them, or defending our ſelues, if fortune ſhould continue her diſfauour to vs. Conſidering, that if wee all die here, it is an immortall glory to vs, and a more honourable buriall then any man can wiſh for. For the whole earth in generall is the rightfull graue, wherein to interre the bodies of men illuſtrious and famous, whoſe memories are not ſo well preſerued by priuate inſcriptions & epitaphes: as by their owne legittimate renowne, which extendeth and publiſheth it ſelfe in the remoteſt nations, who doe more diſcreetly conſider in their ſoules, the height and aduancement of their courage, then the diſaſter which hath befallen them. For it hath bin vniuerſally obſerued, that negligence, the fitteſt attendant for ſhame, is much more irkeſome and diſtaſtefull to a man, that hath a found and entire minde: then any death whatſoeuer, happening to him by valour, with vnconquerable hope of publike glory.
                  All this confirmeth my beleefe (deare and worthie friends) that ſcorning to degenerate from your famous predeceſſors, you will performe ſo much: that the world ſhall witneſſe your great vertue and conſtancy, and that the death of your Prince, is not the ſtroke that ſtrikes you all dead. Wherefore I deſire you, to let mee vnderſtand how you are addicted, to the end, that according to your reſolution: I may ſet in order ſuch affaires, as are needfull for my ſelfe. Aſſuring you in the worde of a King, that were I ſure to dy a thouſand deaths: yet will I not depart from hence, till I ſee the end of mine enemies, or they of me.
                  Theſe words ſo exalted the harts of the hearers, that they anſwered as with a common conſent; they were now more willing to fight then euer, for which King Liſuart thanked them moſt hartily. All this beeing done, hee gaue order, that the Emperours body ſhould be carried to the Monaſtarie of Lubania, vntill better opportunity ſhould ſerue, to performe ſuch ſollemne obſequies & funerall pompe, as in like caſes is required. Then he ſent his Chirurgions, to haue dilligent care of the wounded, to whom he gaue great gifts, and promiſes; as alſo to many Captaines of the Armie. And this hee did not without great cauſe, for euery mans hope (next to the fauour of his Prince) of honeſt

                  The fame of the marriage of Oriana, with the Emperour of Rome, had ſpread it ſelfe in ſo many places: that the good olde Hermit, who nouriſhed Eſplandian in his infant daies, had intelligence therof, eſpecially of the Kings ſubiects diſlike, in compelling his daughter againſt her will, to vndergoe a buſineſſe ſo diſpleaſing to her, and laſtly, what ſuccour was ſent to Amadis in the Encloſed Iſle, wherupon, two great Armies were met in field together. Here I muſt alſo tell you, that hee well knew the ſucceſſe of their loue, the eſtate and

conſcience of Oriana, how ſhe and Amadis had promiſed marriage ech to other, vnder which contracted couenant, Eſplandian was begotten, and therefore ſhe could not be giuen in marriage to any other but our Lord would be highly diſpleaſed therewith. For this cauſe, hee concluded to trauaile to the Encloſed Iſle, to obtaine leaue & licence of her, to acquaint King Liſuart with ſo much as hee knew. Here-upon, ſo ouer-ſpent with yeares, as hee was, hee mounted on his Aſle, and accompanied onely with another good man, bequeathed him-ſelfe to trauaile, and ariued at the Pallace of Apolidon, immediately after King Perions departure: wherwith he was not a little diſcontented, fearing hee ſhould not execute his enterpriſe ſo ſpeedily, but that the two Armies would preuent him.
                  
                     Oriana was quickelod▪ quainted with his comming, a

Ah my good father, it is much worſe with menow, then when I firſt ſaw you, yet heauen (I hope) will ſend mee comfort. Madame, anſwered Naſcian, for this cauſe onely did I leaue my ſmall Hermitage, hauing heard, that the Emperor of Rome, and the King your father, marched towards theſe limits, to bid battaile to Amadis and others with him.

                      not ignorant in ſome ſecrets of your conſcience, and what ſinne you ſhall commit, in beeing giuen as wife to any other, then to him who already is your owne, as heretofore you haue diſcloſed to me.
                  Pawſing a while, and giuing a great ſigh, thus hee proceeded againe. But deare Madame, becauſe I receiued this ſecret in confeſſion: it is not lawfull for me to reueale it, without your owne good will and conſent. Wherefore matters ſtanding on ſuch tearmes as they doe: mee thinkes you ought to be well aduiſed, and to compaſſe ſome meanes, whereby the King your father may be acquainted, with the promiſe paſt between you and Amadis, to the end that hee may no further ſinne thorough ignorance. And ſo much the rather, becauſe you are now in ſuch a place, where he is not able to do you any harme. But if you ſhould happen into his power, as heretofore you haue bin: yet you ought to preferre the feare of God, before any other reſpect whatſoeuer, although it extend to his diſpleaſure, which I hope well to moderate, if you will permit me to ſpeake with him. Alas father, ſaid Oriana, in you only lieth my remedy and comfort: doe therefore what ſhall pleaſe you, and enti

liſteneth to any ſinner, that turnes to him with a contrite heart, and is ſorrowfull for offending him. And by his fauour alſo, grace will be granted me, to finiſh the taske I haue vndertaken, both to his ſeruice, and your contentment.
                  And becauſe the two Armies are neare to one another, and I feare their meeting, before I ſhall bee come to them: may it pleaſe you to let mee part hence this day, leaſt ſome inconuenience may happen by my negligence, and the fruite I expect by my labour, periſh not through ſlothfulneſſe. Father ſaid Oriana, no doubt but God will be your guide, and I earneſtly entreat you, that if you ſee young Eſplandian: to preuaile ſo much by your endeauour, as to bring him hither at your returne. Then ſhee commanded dinner for him, and after hee had refreſhed himſelfe: hee mounted on his Aſſe, ryding directly towards King Liſuart. His aged trauaile was not ſo ſpeedy, but that the two Armies had fought twice together, according as you haue already heard, and hee came thither on the day, before the ſecond truce was finiſhed.
                  As hee paſſed by the Campe, he ſaw (on euery ſide) the interment of many ſlaughtered bodies, whereat hee was ſo grieued, that falling into teares, and lifting vp his eyes and hands to heauen, hee ſaid. O my Lord God, for the honour of thine owne great name, I humbly beſeech thee, to take pittie on this people, and grant mee grace, that I may pacifie this great diſorder. Paſſing on further, hee came neare to the Tent of King Liſuart, who quickly eſpied him, and immediately knew him: whereupon hee went to welcome him, for he held this man of holy life in high eſteem, and well conſidered, that (but vpon ſome great occaſion) he would not haue left his Hermitage; & take ſo great iourney to him, whereupon as hee embraced him, hee ſaid. Good father, you are welcome, then taking him by the hand, he led him into his pauillion, and ſeating him by himſelfe in a chaire of veluet, hee commanded all to depart, and leaue them two alone together, and afterwardes fell into this diſcourſe.
                  Holy father, I know you haue not vndertaken ſo tedious a trauaile, and ill agreeing with your age, but vpon ſome vrgent neceſſity, wherein I humbly deſire you to reſolue me. You haue great reaſon Sir, anſwered Naſcian, to conceiue ſo of me, for vndoubtedly extreamity of yeares, and the condition whereunto it hath pleaſed our Lord to call mee, may well excuſe me from beeing ſeene among men of blood. Neuertheleſſe, conſidering the harme that may enſue, I haue not feared the danger of my perſon, as hoping to performe a ſeruice acceptable to God, and wholeſome to your ſoule. Let me then tell you Sir, that being (ſome few daies ſince) in the Hermitage, whereunto happy chance was your guide, when you and I conferred together, concerning the moſt ſtrange nouriſhing of Eſplandian: I vnderſtood the occaſion of this warre, attempted by you againſt Amadis and his friends. Yet am I well aſſured, that you cannot accompliſh what you would doe, namely, marrie my Ladie your daughter to the Emperour of Rome: by which enterpriſe, many grieuous miſchances haue already happened, not onely becauſe it is not agreeable, to the greateſt and meaneſt of your kingdome, as many

times already hath beene told you: but for ſome other reaſon Sir beſide, concealed from you, yet manifeſt to mee, and againſt which (by Gods lawe) you cannot contrarie. Knowe then Sir, that Madame Oriana your daughter, is already vnited in marriage to another, as heauen hath appointed, and ſtands well pleaſed to haue it ſo.
                  The King beeing much amazed, to heare the olde man ſpeake in this manner: coniectured immediately, that weakeneſſe of braine begot this kinde of language, & that hee was troubled in his vnderſtanding, or elſe had beene miſinformed of that which he ſpake, where-upon hee ſaid vnto him. How father? my daughter was neuer married to my knowledge, neither did I euer purpoſe to giue her to any other, then to the Romane Emperour, to whome I promiſed her, accounting it for her honour and benefit. And God is my witneſſe, that I neuer intended to diſ-inherit her, as many haue inconſiderately immagined: but only to combine alliance with ſo great a Lord, by meanes whereof, he and I ſo vnited together, Chriſtian faith might be the more augmented. And therfore my intention beeing iuſt, mee thinkes I ſhould not be therin blamed.
                  Sir, anſwered the Hermite, that which I haue tolde you, concerning ſome matters hidden from you, yet to mee apparant: I will preſently declare vnto you, for from none other then my ſelfe can you know them. Vnderſtand then, my Lord, that the ſelfe ſame day, when (by your command) I came to the Forreſt, where, for more delight of the Ladies then preſent with you, your Tents were erected for view of the ſporte (I knowe not whether you remember it, or no:) I brought you young Eſplandian, who preſented you the Lioneſſe, that gaue him ſuck at the firſt: The ſame day, the Princſſe Oriana your daughter was confeſſed by me, & tolde mee in her confeſſion, that ſhe had promiſed mariage to Amadis de Gaule, at ſuch time as he deliuered her from the Enchanter Archalaus, to whom you had giuen her, a little before that the Damoſell (by whom you were enchanted) had brought your ſtate and perſon into the greateſt danger that could bee poſſible, from which Galaor freed you. And beleeue it to be very likely, that our Lord himſelfe, gaue conſent to the mariage, for Eſplandian is the iſſue thereof, and of him, Vrganda the Vnknowen, foretolde many maruailes, as you your ſelfe doe very well know.
                  Now, in my poore iudgement, you ſhould not be diſpleaſed there-with, conſidering, that Amadis is the ſonne of a King, and accounted (in all places) to be one of the beſt and moſt gracious Knights in all the world. I would aduiſe you Sir, that in ſhewing your ſelfe to be ſuch as you euer haue beene: you ſhould defend the honour and conſcience of your daughter, and making an end of this warre, call her home again to you, & vſe her hereafter as reaſon requireth. In ſo doing, our Lord will be well pleaſed with you, who elſe will (doubtleſſe) bee offended with you, for the effuſion of ſo much blood, which you haue cauſed to be ſhedde vpon no occaſion.
                  When the King had all this while liſtned to this diſcourſe, he ſhewed himſelfe to be very penſiue, and at laſt ſaide. Good father, is it poſſible that my daughter ſhould bee

married to Amadis? Yes truely replied Naſcian, hee is her husband, and Eſplandian is your grandchilde. O God (quoth the King) how ill hath it been for mee, that I could not know this matter till now? vpon my faith, many good Knights had yet beene liuing, which now (to my no little griefe) are dead. Alas father, why could not you ſooner haue reuealed this? I might not doe it, anſwered the Hermite, for it was tolde mee in confeſſion, and if now I haue made it knowne to you, thinke it is done by ſuch permiſſion, as I receiued from the Princeſſe your daughter, for otherwiſe, you had neuer heard it from mee. But ſhe is therewith well contented, as well for the clearing of her ſoule: as alſo to take away all occaſion from you, of further ſinning herein through ignorance.
                  At that very inſtant, meere conceit in the King, preſented before the eyes of his ſoule, the ſeuerall ſeruices hee had receiued by Amadis and his k

Deſert in Amadis pleaded iuſtly for his daughter, and a greater gift, if hee could beſtow it on him; and ſo much the rather, becauſe the Emperor (to whom he had promiſed her) was dead, and beſide, Vrganda had tolde him many wonders, concerning Eſplandi

                        : but aboue all the reſt, that hee ſhould be the cauſe, of perpetuall peace between him and Amadis, as euen already (in a manner) hee ſaw performed, and hauing diſcourſed all this in his minde, thus hee anſwered Naſcian. Father, albeit I had ſet downe my reſt for death, & all mine with me, or to haue the vpper hand in this warre: yet ſeeing how matters haue happened, I will follow your counſell, and I entreat you moſt affectionately, to worke ſo well with Amadis: that hee may liſten to peace, which (for my part) I put into your hands, to the end, that you may hereafter teſtifie before God, with what dutie I ſubmit my ſelfe in this caſe.
                  Theſe wordes were ſo pleaſing to the good old Hermite, as, weeping for meere ioy, hee fell before the Kings feet, ſaying. O moſt happy Prince, the Lord almighty quite you for this kindneſſe, and bleſſe you with long and proſperous life. The King taking him by the hand, & raiſing him vp, ſaid. Father, I wil perform what I haue promiſed you, without any manner of reuocation. Neuertheleſſe, I would haue al men to know, that neither feare, or defect of courage, hath hereunto conſtrained mee: but reaſon only, and in ſuch nature as you haue reuealed to mee. Wherefore, it ſhall be fitting for you, to go into King Per
                           •
                        ons Campe, before the truce bee fully ended, to the ende, that according to what you ſhall certifie me, I may ſtand vpon my guard. Sir, ſaid Naſcian, if God ſo pleaſe, I will neither eate nor drinke, till I haue ſpoken with Amadis, and let me entreate leaue for my departure, becauſe occaſion now frankly offers herſelfe to me.
                  Hauing thus ſpoken, the King & hee returned to the Knights, where they found Eſplandian, newly there ariued from Queene Briſena, who had ſent him from Vindiliſore to King Liſuart only to vnderſtand of his health, whom when Naſcian beheld, hee knew him preſently: yet wondred to ſee him of ſo taule ſtature, & very neare ready to vndergo Armes, which made him (with meer ioy) runne and embrace him. But

the young gentleman was much amazed, to ſee the olde man ſo wonderfull kinde to him, hauing wholly forgotten him, and therefore bluſhed ſtrangely: notwithſtanding, ſoone after, he both remembred the Hermite and his hermitage, and falling on his knees before him, kiſſed his hand, when the olde man folding him in his armes, ſaid. Beloued childe of God, bleſſed be the houre of thy birth, and praiſed bee the name of our Lord, for proſpering thee to ſuch eſtate wherein I now ſee thee.
                  During this diſcourſe, the ſtanders by were much amazed, to ſee this holy man vſe Eſplandian ſo louingly, and the King himſelfe, bebut newly aduertiſed, that hee was grandfather to him: mooued with a fatherly affection, felt ſuch ioy in his ſoule, as neuer at any time hee receiued more. So that the hatred which he formerly bare to Amadis and his friends: became ſuddenly changed into amity extraordinary, and hee demanded of the youth, from whence he came. Eſplandian, well enſtructed by nature, kiſſing a packet of Letters in his hand, humbly preſented them to the King, anſwering thus. Sir, the Queene my Miſtreſſe ſent mee to you, as there more at large you may be certified. Then the King opened the letters, wherein (among other matters) ſhee earneſtly entreated him: that by all meanes hee would liſten to peace, if hee might doe it with his honour. After hee had ouer-read the Letters, hee ſhewed them to Naſcian, ſaying, Beholde good father, it ſeems that my Queen knows already, what is intended betweene you and me. Sir, ſaid the Hermite, ſhee counſelleth you wiſely, and if God be ſo pleaſed, that which ſhee ſo earneſtly deſireth, ſhall bee put in execution, before this yong gentleman returnes to her againe. Wherefore, let mee craue of your Maieſty, to let him goe along with mee in companie, to the end, that during my trauaile, I may conuerſe with him the more eaſily. Let it be ſo then, anſwered the King, for it is my will, that hee ſhall not leaue you, ſo long as you would haue him with you. The Hermite moſt humbly thanked the King, and preſently mounted on his Aſſe, as Eſplandian did on his horſe, attended only by Sergill his companion, who had come along thither with him.
                  So they departed thence, taking the way towards King Perion, and all that while, the good olde man conferred with Eſplandian, euen till they were ariued at the watch. There they were ſtayed, to knowe wherefore they came, and what they demanded: but when they vnderſtood, that Naſcian came to ſpeake with Lord Amadis, they conducted them both to his Tent, and there preſented them vnto him. Here you muſt conſider, that he had neuer before ſeene the reuerend olde man, and therefore knew not what he ſhould thinke, or what buſineſſe hee might haue with ſuch a perſon. Looking likewiſe on Eſplandian, he had as little knowledge of him: albeit hee had formerly ſpoken to him, on the ſame day, when he combated the Romanes, on the behalfe of faire Graſinda, & when he (being then very young) begged the liues of the two Knights, that elſe had been ſlaine by Amadis. But Quedragant, who had taken better notice of him, when hee met him at his laſt returne from Great Brittaine, went and embraced him, ſaying. Faire Sir, you deſired me (and Brian alſo) not long ſince, to doe your commendations to the Greek

Knight; which wee accordingly performed, and here he is himſelfe, to iuſtifie that wee failed not therein.
                  Theſe wordes gaue aſſured teſtimony to Amadis, that hee to whom Quedragant ſpake, was his ſonne, which made him feele inwardly ineſtimable ioy. And then the young Gentleman came and did him reuerence, not as a ſonne to his father, beeing yet ignorant of him: but as to the onely Knight of the world, & by whom he had hope to haue his knighthood, ſo conceu ed in him, on the very ſame day hee combated the Emperours Knights. Notwithſtanding, the differences happening between the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, and them of Great Brittain, raiſed a wounderfull doubt in him, that he ſhould not attaine to his intention. Then Amadis embracing him, demanded if King Liſuart had granted leaue for his comming to him. My Lord, quoth he, this good olde father Naſcian, will acquaint you with the reaſon of his comming to you.
                  Obſerue here, that Amadis had often heard of this Hermite, who was reputed generally, for a moſt holy man of life: wherefore, going to him, hee ſaid. Father, I pray you pardon mee, for I knew you not at your entrance: but now I vnderſtand more of you, and the honour that is due to you by deſert. Honour (replied the Hermit) be giuen to God only, I am his poore humble ſeruant, who (in his feare) deſires to ſpeake alone with you in ſecret, if it ſhall pleaſe you but to heare me. Yes on my faith, anſwered Amadis. And ſo, taking him by the hand, they went aſide by themſelues, and Naſcian began in this manner with him.
                  Sonne, before you vnderſtand the cauſe, which hath mooued mee to come ſee you, I would ſet before your eyes, the great obligations wherein you are indebted to our Lord: to the ende, that you may henceforth encline your ſelfe, to do ſuch things, as are beſt pleaſing to him. I make no doubt, but am well aſſured, you haue often heard, how in the very firſt daies of your life, you were forſaken of all friends, and giuen ouer to the mercie of the Sea, in a matter of ſmall defence, and without any other guarde but God: by whoſe goodneſſe, you fell into their hands, who afterwardes gaue you nouriſhment, euen vntil you came to be a Knight, and the moſt compleate knowne at this day. For our Lord hath indu
                     
                        •
                     d you with ſtrength, to gaine the maiſtery of many Giants, Monſters, Tyrants, and moſt cruell beaſts, whereby your renowne hath extended it ſelfe, into all partes of the worlde. Now, ſeeing he hath enriched you with ſo many great graces, mee thinkes it is no more then reaſon: that you ſhould acknowledge him for your ſoueraign Lord, and labour in thankefulneſs to him, by humbling your ſelfe before his face, for otherwiſe, all the fauours hee hath beſtowen vpon you, will turne but to your ſhame and diſgrace.
                  Sonne, you ſee how olde and decrepit I am, nature (almoſt) decaied in mee: Notwithſtanding, I haue not feared, to vndertake ſo long a iourney to you, becauſe I heard (euen in mine owne poore Hermitage) the diſcord betweene you and King Liſuart, with whom I haue lately ſpoken, and found him to be ſuch a man, as a good Prince, and miniſter of God ought to bee, and ready (if nothing keep you to the contrary) to liſten to peace,

which (me thinkes) you ought not to refuſe, as well for the quiet of your conſcience, as for the ſafety of your perſon. And to the end, that you may make no diſguiſing of your affections: let me aſſure you, that I know more of your moſt intimate affaires, then you imagine I doe, for Madame Oriana (vnder the ſeal of confeſſion) hath tolde mee a chiefe ſecret, concerning you both.
                  When Amadis heard him ſpeake ſo plainely, hee knew well enough, that he ſpake nothing but the truth, wherefore hee thus anſwered. Father, if I could ſerue my God, according to his graces and mercies beſtowed on mee; I might well eſteeme my ſelfe the moſt happie Knight in the worlde. But, beeing a grieuous ſinner, as I am, preferring (too often) mine owne pleaſure before his glory: I muſt needs faile, as other men doe, to my no little griefe. Yet I hope (knowing mine owne defects) to behaue my ſelfe better then heretofore I haue done. Humbly beſeeching you, good father, not to feare, or defer in telling me, what you beſt thinke I ought to doe, that may bee moſt acceptable to him, for I will therein obey you, to my vttermoſt power. Ah my good ſonne (quoth he) you do enough in taking this wholſome way: whereby I hope to bee your guide, not only for the tranquility of your countrie, but alſo for the good of many ſoules.
                  Then he recounted to him, how hee had trauelled to the Encloſed Iſle, where hee had conuerſed with Oriana, and by her conſent, was ſent to King Liſuart, and acquainted him with all hee had in charge: eſpecially, the troth-plight marriage of them both, the iſſue where-of, was Eſplandian. And beleeue me childe, quoth the Hermite, the King hath heerein carried himſelfe ſo vertuouſly, and takes all in ſuch good part; that if you fall not off, I hope to vnite a perpetuall alliance betweene you.
                  Now you may diuine, whether Amadis heard theſe tydings gladly, or no: but I dare aſſure you, they were ſo welcome to him, as hee had no power to diſſemble his inward ioy, but preſently returned this anſwere to the Hermite. If it ſhall pleaſe the King to accept me as his ſonne, I promiſe you (good father) that hee ſhall finde me ſo tractable to him, as I will be diligent in doing him any ſeruice. There remaineth no more then, replied the Hermite, but that you both may ſpeake together: therefore aduiſe with your ſelfe, both how and when it may moſt conueniently bee done. Let me tell you, anſwered Amadis, I would haue you firſt, go to King Perion my father, and tell him the cauſe of your comming to me: likewiſe your owne opinion, that king Liſuart will now accept thoſe offers, which laſtly were made to him in Great Brittaine (on our behalfe) by Quedragant and Brian de Moniaſte, concerning the Princeſſe Oriana, if they might be once more tendered to him. Say moreouer, you are well aſſured, that hee ſhall finde him reaſonable, and a Prince of peace, euen as any other what-ſoeuer in the world: And you may tell him, that you haue ſpoken with me, but I haue referred all to his diſpoſition. For the honour of God, ſaid the good olde man, I pray you (without any longer delaying) to let me be brought where hee is. Father, replied Amadis, my ſelfe therein will ſerue as a guide to you, and for ſo good an occaſion.
                  Vpon theſe tearmes, they went

inſtantly to King Perion, who being aduertiſed of Naſcians comming, came to welcome him: but beholding Eſplandian with him, he could not gueſſe who hee ſhould be, only hee appeared to be a very goodlie creature, as any he had euer looked on in his life, wherefore he demaunded of the Hermite, whether he were his ſon, or no? Sir (quoth hee) hee is partly mine, as beeing a foſter father to him in his younger yeares, and our Lord beſtowed him on me (almoſt) miraculouſly. It is very true, anſwered the King, if this be hee, to whom the Lioneſſe gaue ſucke at his beginning, as I haue often heard, and of whom, Vrganda the Vnknowen hath foretolde many wounders: and among the reſt, that he ſhal be the cauſe of planting peace and amity between King Liſuart and my ſonne Amadis, which I pray God indu
                        •
                      him with grace to doe. And beleeue mee, ſeeing ſuch faire fruit is to fal from his fortune, hee well deſerues to be both beloued and eſteemed. In truth anſwered the Hermite, this is hee of whom you ſpeake, and when you haue further knowledge of him, you will affect him more then you imagine, as at better leaſure, I ſhal hereafter tell you.
                  Then hee called Eſplandian, and commanded him to doe reuerence to the King: when the young Gentle man, ſetting his knee to the ground, would haue kiſſed the Kings hand, but hee tooke him in his armes, ſaying. Gentle Sir, you are ſo faire and vertuouſly quallified: that ſuch as ſee you, or haue euer heard of you, doth both loue and highly eſteeme you. And I am perſwaded, you will proue ſo worthie a man, that Knighthood were very deſertfully beſtowed vpō you. Eſplandian hearing himſelfe ſo cō
                     mended, began to grow ſomewhat baſhfull thereat: and perceiuing the King to bluſh likewiſe, deſired to know of the Hermite, if he could tell whoſe ſonne hee was. Sir, ſaid Naſcian to the King, this young man (as yet) knoweth not any thing concerning his owne demand, and as for my ſelfe, I am very certaine, that hee hath neither father or mother, from whom (as yet) hee hath receiued any great fauours. Neuertheleſſe, our Lord hath hitherto preſerued him, and gaue him me (at the firſt) to loue and inſtruct him, as mine owne childe.
                  At theſe wordes, the King began to conceiue, that hee would not conferre any further with him before ſo many by-ſtanders, & therefore tooke him aſide: but the Hermite changed his diſcourſe, ſaying. I beſeech you Sir to beleeue, that conſidering the condition whereto I haue been long time called, and ſo many aged yeares already ouer-gone me: I would not haue forſaken my Cell, to bee ſeene among warres and contentions, had it not been, that my ſlacknes in ſo important a buſineſſe, might haue procured much euill, wherewith our Lord would haue been highly offended. And his diſpleaſure would not only haue extended it ſelfe to you, & the people aſſembled in both theſe Campes: but alſo to many other, vnskilfull in the diſcords betweene you and King Liſuart, with whom I haue already conferred, & ſo well perſwaded him to peace, as hee is ready both to liſten thereto, and to entertaine it, according as I haue imparted to Lord Amadis your ſonne, who wholly referreth all to you. Therefore I deſire you Sir, that preferring the good and tranquile eſtate of ſo many people, before priuate ſpleens and paſſions:

not to diſdaine what is freely offered you, and which you ought rather ſtriue to purchaſe.
                  Father, replied King Perion, God is my witneſſe, what griefe I haue endured, for matters that are alreadie paſt, with the loſſe of ſo many worthie men, and how gladly I would haue gone another way, if King Liſuart would haue liſtened thereto. But hee alwaies carried ſo high a hand, as, notwithſtanding all remonſtrances made to him by our Ambaſſadours, eſpecially in reguarde of Madame Oriana, whom hee ſought to diſinherite: he made no account of vs at all, preſuming ſo much vpon himſelfe, that by the ayde of the Romane Emperour, hee would ouer-run the whole worlde. By this meanes hee made refuſall, not only to admit this difference to iuſtice; but likewiſe contemned all hearing thereof. Neuertheleſſe, if hee will yet ſubmit to reaſon: I dare repoſe ſuch truſt in my followers, as they will bee ordered by mine aduice. I haue euermore deſcanted on this diſcourſe, proceeding from no other occaſion, but whereto hee ſtands bound by right of nature, and to his owne blood. So that, if hee will yet repeale the princeſſe his daughter, into his former gracious fauour, and not marrie her to any other perſon, not onely to her, and his owne people, but to all them that know or heare thereof: wee will deliuer her to him, and continue his kinde friends, if hee bee as deſirous as wee.
                  Sir, anſwered the good old man, if God bee ſo pleaſed, all this will come to paſſe. Therefore, if you thinke it conuenient, elect two Knights on your behalfe, to determine the differences, where-about ſo many harmes haue alreadie happened: King Liſuart ſhall likewiſe nominate two other for him, and I ſtanding in the midſt between them will labour to ende all ſtrife and contention. Bee it ſo, quoth the King. Sir, ſaid Naſcian, I will not ſleep, before (I hope) to ſpeed, with ſuch ſucceſſe, as the effects ſhall be anſwerable to your owne deſire.
                  Inſtantly hee tooke leaue of him and the reſt, returning whence he came, to finiſh what he had begun. And preſently King Perion ſommoned all the chiefe of his Armie together, ſpeaking to them in this maner. Lords, & endeared friends, as we are bound to put our goods and perſons in danger, not onely for the defence of our honour, but alſo to maintaine equity & iuſtice: ſo are wee likewiſe obliged, to ſet aſide all hatred and paſſion, to reconcile our ſelues with our enemie: when (of himſelfe) hee profers vs peace. For, although it cannot be gaine-ſaied, but that the beginning of warre may goe on, without offence to God: yetnotwithſtanding, in the end, if through raſh opinion, fantiſie and want of knowledge, we eſtrange our ſelues from reaſon; that which (at the firſt) appeared honeſt, conuerts it ſelfe into iniuſtice. And doe not thinke, that I vſe theſe ſpeaches to you without cauſe. Naſcian, a holy Hermite (well knowen to the moſt part of you) came lately to mee, as you ſawe, to practiſe peace betweene vs and our enemie: where-to King Liſuart is willing to yeeld, if you miſlike not. Neuertheleſſe, I would not giue him any reſolution, till firſt I heard your deliberations.
                  For, to mee it ſeemeth very reaſonable, that as you haue been made partakers of toyle and trauaile, ſo

ſhould you alſo be of eaſe and tranquility. And therefore I pray you, that without any diſſimulation, you would all aduiſe for the beſt, and God will therin further your counſell. For my ſelfe according to the opinion of olde Naſcian, I holde it very meet, that wee ſhould make choyce of two Knights amongſt vs, and giue them ample power, to determine with two other (appointed by King Liſuart) of all differences, whereby this warre receiued originall. Albeit, I deſire not to be credited in this caſe; but rather will allowe of ſuch aduiſe, as you conceiue fitteſt for the good of all together. Hereupon, Angriote d' Eſtreuaus firſt preſented himſelfe, of whom the King required his opinion. Sir, ſaid hee, you haue beene choſen chiefe of this enterpriſe, as well for the dignity of a king ſhining in you; as for the fauour and eſteeme generally helde of you, whereby you may reſolue on the buſineſſe of this warre, as it ſhall ſeeme beſt vnto your ſelfe. Notwithſtanding, ſeeing it is your pleaſure, that I ſhall firſt ſpeake my minde: I like it well (vnder correction) that if peace be preſented vs by our enemy, wee ought to accept it. For, as it falles out, it is to our no meane aduantage, hauing not onely the better of him already: but Madame Oriana alſo in our owne power, for whoſe cauſe wee firſt entred into the field. Now, for the naming two choyce men among vs, to accord (as you ſay) all differences: I know none more meet for ſuch a buſineſſe, then the Lords Quedragant, & Brian de Moniaſte. They (at the firſt) vnderwent this charge, when they were ſent into Great Brittaine, to excuſe vs to King Liſuart, for that which we had done, in reſcuing his daughter from the Romanes: and I am peſwaded, they will vndertake the ſame charge againe, if they were thereto entreated. Now becauſe this aduiſe found generall allowance, Brian and Quedragant yeelded preſently thereto: whereat king Perion was highly pleaſed, hoping the warre ſo hotly begun, would by theſe meanes be calmely ended.
               
               
                  CHAP. XX.
                  
                     How Naſcian returned towards King Liſuart, with the anſwere he
                           •
                        receiued from King Perion.
                     
                  
                  
                     THe Hermite being returned backe to King Liſuart, gaue him to vnderſtand, all that he had agreed on with king Perion: aſſuring him withall, that hee would make them good friends, before hee parted from them. For I left him (quoth hee) with a purpoſe, to conferre with the chiefe of his Army, to winne them thereto, if hee can. Father, ſaide the King, hee dealeth moſt wiſely therein, to the ende that none of them ſhould receiue diſcontentment: And for my part, I meane to doe the like, as you ſhall preſently ſee performed. Then hee went to ſee Gaſquilan, who (as yet) kept his bed, with the extreame paine of his broken arme, receiued when he encountred with Amadis. There hee

ſent for king Cildadan, and ſome other chiefe Commanders in his Campe, to whom hee declared, what ſpeeches had paſt betweene the Hermite Naſcian and him, tending wholly to peace and concord; concealing (neuertheleſſe) matters concerning Amadis and his daughter. Finally, hee acquainted them with the anſwere of king Perion, requiring their further counſell in the buſineſſe.
                  But firſt of all (quoth hee to Arquiſill) ſeeing you now holde the place of the deceaſed Emperour, my brother, for whom (in part) this warre was begun; we are to vnderſtand your minde. My Lord, anſwered Arquiſill, if the Emperour were now liuing, wee that are his vaſſailes, ought to ſerue him as well in warre as peace: but hee beeing dead; with the finiſhing of his daies, all command hee had ouer vs, is likewiſe concluded. Neuertheleſſe, wee will yet doe for you, as for him, ſo that your ſeruice (what lieth in vs) ſhall no way bee tardied, while you thinke good to make vſe of vs. Notwithſtanding, if king Perion be inclined to peace, I beleeue, they that affect your honour, as they ought to doe, will counſell you alwaies to accept therof: prouided, that it bee no way hurtfull for you. For you may eaſily conſider (at the very firſt view) that fortune ſtands not for you & yours, and if wee linger on further, it may prooue worſe then hitherto it hath done for vs.
                  My Lord, ſaid the King of Swetia, if peace may bee treated with your enemie, I would aduiſe you not to refuſe it: conſidering the moſt of your people are wounded, others ſicke and crazed, and a long turce is now very needfull, if a re-enforcement bee thought expedient, after a ſufficient time of reſt. By all means poſſible, ſaid the King, let vs bee deliuered out of this paine, for king Perion (on his ſide) hath choſen two Knights, to accord all our differences: And I will nominate two other, which ſhall bee you Arban king of Norwales, and Guillan le Penſif, who haue well vnderſtood how al matters happened, from the beginning to this day. In the meane while, I will ſend backe Naſcian to king Perion, to entreate him, to withdrawe his Campe a daies iourney backwarde: and wee will meet in the Citie of Lubania, for conference during the time of peace.
                  Such was their reſolution, wherupon, king Liſuart, quickely returned to Naſcian, to whom hee declared all that was agreed vpon; praying him moſt affectionately, to finiſh the buſineſſe hee had begun. Sir, quoth hee, I will obey whatſoeuer you ſhall command me, and hauing ſpoken with king Perion: you ſhall know the houre for your departure hence, & when the Armie muſt diſlodgh. So departing from him, hee went to Amadis, who no ſooner ſawe him, but hee demanded of him, what newes he brought backe: and whether king Liſuart continued in his former determination, or no? The Hermit let him vnderſtand all, and for the better proceeding in this caſe, thought it fit; that both the Campes ſhould be further diuided from each other, then now they were: whereunto king Perion eaſily condeſcended, and it was confirmed likewiſe by generall conſent. Hereupon, carely the next morning, euery man truſſed vp his bag and baggage, and the Campes fell

back ſeuen miles and more. Where wee will now leaue them planting their Tents, to tell you, what end the enterpriſe of king Arauigne ſorted to, who but awaited a conuenient time, to ſurpriſe one or both the Armies.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXI.
                  
                     How King Arauigne, being aduertiſed of the loſſe, which King Liſuart had ſuſtained, and the diſlodging of his Campe; determined to giue him battaile.
                  
                  
                     YOu haue already heard the enterpriſe of King Arauigne, who, after his powers were vnited together, ceaſed not trauailing ouer the mountains: but yet ſo couertly, as neither king Perion or Liſuart could attaine to any certaine knowledge there-of. For he kept himſelfe very cloſe, watching but opportunity, to ſet on the firſt of the Campes that ſhould be broken. For this cauſe immediately after king Liſuart was diſlodged, and gone directly to the Citie of Lubania: the Scoutes of Archalaus his Campe, who were on the toppe of all the mountaine, diſcouered the Armies retyring, wherof he gaue intelligence to king Arauigne. Who imagining them to bee the whole ſtrength, intended to ſet forward, and rather to aſſaile them, then the forces of Amadis, as beeing perſwaded, that if hee brought his attempt to effect, king Perion would not afterwarde care for contending with him, about the kingdome of Great Brittaine, but that eaſily hee might enioy it in peace.
                  Theſe beeing his endes, and to compaſſe them, hee concluded ſtill to lie cloſe, vntill the night enſuing: when he would then giue both the Alarme and battaile together, as being the readieſt way to ſurpriſe them. Then hee commanded his Nephew Eſclanor, a man skilfull in feates of warre, as any other poſſibly could be; to take twenty knights with him, and following the traine of the enemy in the cloſeſt manner, truely to diſcouer, where they would campe the night enſuing.
                  Now, you muſt heere obſerue with me, that King Liſuart was continually ſuſpitious, what king Arauigne intended to doe, hauing receiued ſundry aduertiſements, that hee marched in the countrie with a great power, and yet could not heare which was hee went. Some of the countrie gaue him notice, that hee kept himſelfe ambuſhed in the mountaines, and becauſe hee would prouide againſt any inconuenience,: he called king Cildadan, and all the Captaines, and acquainted them with his minde, deſiring them to take order, that their people ſhould keepe cloſe together, without any forraging, or ſcattering one from another, but followe ſtill the Artillery in frame of battail, as formerly had beene appointed them. And although ſome were of the minde, to ſend aduertiſement to K. Perion, what they had heard cō
                     cerning K. Arauigne, that he might the better ſtand vpon his own gard, and ſuccour them if they ſhould be diſtreſſed: yet King Liſuart had a heart ſo high and magnanimous,

as he would by no meanes conſent thereto, affecting rather to hazard his life, then loſe the leaſt iot of his reputation. Only he ſent Philipinel, accompanied with twenty bolde Knights, to diſcouer and runne thorough the countrie, commanding them expreſly, to coaſt along the mountaines, and let him hourely vnderſtand, what they could heare of the enemy. So pacing on about foure miles, he encamped, and gaue it out by man to man, that a little reſt muſt now ſerue, becauſe they would march all night to Lubania.
                  
                  Not farre had Philipinell trauailed, but he diſcouered Eſclanor and his twenty Knights: wherewith immediately hee acquainted king Liſuart, and that (without all doubt) the ſtrength of Arauignes Armie was hid among the Rocks. At that very inſtant king Liſuart diſlodged, to gaine entrance into the Citie: for there hee purpoſed to expect ſuccour, if hee ſhould be preſſed thereto, ſtealing on by little and little from the mountaine, and marching on vpon the plaine. Which when Eſclanor noted, he ſent to bid king Aranigne, that hee ſhould put on (with all haſte) by the the moſt ſecret paſſages: but the way was ſo ſtraite and narrow, as they could not march but two together at the the moſt. By which meanes, before they could attaine to king Liſuart, hee and his were very neare to the Citie: whereat Arauigne began to deſpaire, fearing to faile vtterly in his enterpriſe.
                  By this time alſo, Eſplandian and Sergill (whom the Hermite had ſent to king Liſuart) finding his Campe diſlodged: made ſuch ſpeed, that they ſawe the men (both horſe and foot) deſcending downe the mountaine. Then they preſently coniectured, that this was the Armie of king Arauigne, whereof they heard the Queene Briſania ſpeake, before they parted from her. Wherefore, fearing this power to be ouer great, for that of king Liſuart (who had beene almoſt vtterly ouerthrone in the precedent battailes) they grew to great diſmay, ſo that Eſplandian ſaid to Sergill. Brother, I pray you that wee may returne to Lord Amadis, and let him vnderſtand what wee haue ſeene. Sergill was very willing, and returning the ſame way they came, they rode ſo dilligently: that by the breake of day, they alighted in king Perions Campe; where hee had newly receiued intelligence, that king Arauigne and his people marched thorough the countrie, and therefore kept his Armie (for the moſt part) all that night in order of battaile.
                  
                     Eſplandian and Sergill, going to the Tent of Amadis, found there the Hermite Naſcian: who was not a little amazed, to ſee thē ſo quickly returned, & demanded of them, whither they went. Father, anſwered Eſplandian, it is very needeful, that I ſhould ſpeake with Lord Amadis, to let him know ſome matters, that do greatly concerne king Liſuart and his troupes. Now Amadis had but withdrawne himſelfe a while, only for a little refreſhing, becauſe all the night hee had been in Armes: notwithſtanding, when hee heard what the young Gentle-man had ſaide, hee called him to him, demanding of him the eſtate of the matter. My Lord (quoth he) king Arauigne hath beſieged the King my Maſter, neare vnto the city of Lubania, & with ſuch a power: as if you ſend him not ſuccour, & that ſpeedily, I thinke you ſhall neuer ſee him while you liue, but either taken or ſlaine, and all that are with him. Wherefore I pray you doe

ſo much for him, as you are wont to do for many others, who (it may bee) are not in ſuch deepe diſtreſſe as hee.
                  When Amadis heard theſe news; remembrance of diſpleaſing his Ladic Oriana, if her father ſhould be diſcomfited, and by his moſt deadly enemy in the world, through defect of aſſiſtance from him: enflamed ſo his ſoule, that, without anſwering ſo much as a worde, hee went to king Perton, ſpeaking thus. My Lord, for ought I heare, king Arauigne hath turned his backe on vs, to fight with king Liſuart, and is already ſo neare him, that it is a great aduenture, but hee will bidde him battaile. Whereat I ſhall not be a little diſpleaſed, knowing well that they of Great Brittaine, haue loſt ſo many of their men againſt vs, as they are not able now to outſtand a freſh force. Moreouer, if they ſhould bee ouerthrowne (being come forth of their Campe, in hope of future peace betweene them and vs:) it will appeare to many, that this ambuſcado was laid for them by our inuention, and that (by our meanes) king Arauigne was thus treacherouſly ſet vpon them, to our moſt high diſparagement, among all them that ſhall ſo imagine of vs. Wherefore, I entreate you Sir, that with a part of this Armie, I may go before and giue them ſuccour.
                  Sonne anſwered King Perion, doe what you think beſt, and if you goe before, I will follow and backe you: if by miſchance you ſhould be preuented. Amadis moſt humbly thanked him, and parting thence, met with Floreſtan, Quedragant, Garuate, and Gaſtilles, whom he acquainted with his enterpriſe, where-to they gaue good allowance. Here-upon, they forthwith ſet their men in order, marching directly for Lubania: fully reſolued, to fight with king Arauigne and his men, if they might meet them in the field.

                     WE haue heretofore very amply declared, how King Liſuart had intelligence by his vant courers, that the Armie of King Arauigne purſued him: by meanes whereof hee diſlodged, hoping to gaine the Citie of Lubania before the fight. For he knew well enough, that he had not ſtrength ſufficient to ſtand againſt ſo great an hoſte of men, and freſhly come into the field: but he was ſuddenly ſet vpon, and followed ſo hotly, as hee had ſmall meanes of helping himſelfe. The two Camps began to skirmiſh together, continuing fierce aſſaults eace againſt other, vntill darke night ouer-tooke them: wherefore, they were conſtrained to remaine encamped near one to another, in expectation of the morning, to beginne againe in better manner, then before they had done.
                  King Liſuart (by no meanes) would retire, as fearing to affright his followers, and wholy diſharten them: and therefore making a vertue of neceſſity, ſo ſoone as the

night was ſpent, he ordered his battaile ſo well as hee could, determining to die among his men, rather then blemiſh his honor in the leaſt degree. Barſinan, who led the vantguarde for king Arauigne, firſt gaue the onſet with his troupes: but before they came to handy blowes, many were laide on the earth with the great Ordenance, which plaied vpon then without ceaſing. Neuertheleſſe, at length they entred fight pell mell, and Griſall, who was Enſigne bearer to Archalaus, was ouer-throwne in this firſt encounter by Norandell, albeit Archalaus laboured his vtmoſt to releeue him. But king Cildadan, accompanied with many of his chiefeſt men, began to breake through the preaſe, whereby Barſinan had beene inſtantly foyled: but for the re-enforce, which king Arauigne ſent by the Duke of Briſtoy.
                  
                  Now might you haue ſeen many Launces ſhiuering in the ayre, and both horſe & foot weltring in their blood on the ground, a ſight moſt pitifull to beholde. For king Liſuart (playing at double, or quit) attended by the reſt of his Armie, came vpon the flankes of his enemies, and the firſt hee met withall, was the brother to Aluinas (whom Floreſtan ſlew at the Fountaine of Oliues, where the three Damoſels were guarded by the Dwarſſe) whō hee vnhorſed ſo lubberly, that hee brake his necke, by his horſes falling vpon him. Purſuing on his purpoſe, Archalaus eſpied him, who knew him very perfectly, and followed on ſo faſt, that hee ſhewed him to Barſinan, ſaying. You haue no other worke to doe, but inſtantly to reuenge your fathers ſhamefull death, for that is hee, which made him ſo ſuffer. Then Barſinan called to him ten of his Knights, with whom hee came, and ſet vpon King Liſuart, and ouerthrewe him to the ground, where hee was encloſed (on all ſides) by Archalaus and a great many more, who laboured their very vttermoſt, as hoping to take him. But Philipinell, with them that had (the day before) diſcouered the Armie of Arauigne, came and ſuccoured him: notwithſtanding their lot had fallen ſoule, but for king Cildadan, Arquiſill, Norandell, and Brandoryas.
                  
                  Now grew the fight fiercer and fiercer, for theſe foure ruſhed thorough the croudes ſo boiſterouſly, that they bare downe horſe & man before them: and notwithſtanding al reſiſtance the enemy could make, they remounted the King vpon Norandells horſe, for he had alighted, that the King might haue him. Then taking a Sworde in both his hands, (which he found by good fortune) hee performed therewith ſuch extraordinarie deeds of Armes: as in meere deſpite of Barſinan and his followers, hee horſed himſelfe againe, wherein Brandoyuas was no meane help to him. Archalaus then wel perceiued, that they muſt needs haue the worſt, except king Arauigne came vppe with his troupes: wherefore hee ſent a young Squire of his, and bad him goe tell him, that hee was much amazed, why he ſhould leaue him thus in ſo ſerious a buſineſſe. The Squire ranne preſently, and performed his charge: but Archalaus anſwered him, that he thus delayed, hoping to draw King Liſuart and his men, further off from the Cittie, that hee might be the more eaſily encompaſſed at pleaſure.
                  But now hee marched on with his ſquadron, which furiouſly brake in vpon King Liſuarts forces, who were then ſo wearied, and few in

number: as they were repelled to retire, euen within the gate of the City, where they ſaued themſelues, by the meanes of king Cildadan, Arban, Grumedan, Norandell, Guillan, Arquiſill and others, who followed in the traine. Now, if theſe worthie men declared (thus reſcuing) their greatneſſe of ſpirit, you muſt conceiue, that king Liſuart as plainely witneſſed, that hee forgot not his honour in ſuch a neceſſity: for neuer was any Knight ſeene, that more forwardely aduentured his perſon to perill, then he did, nor with more allacrity of courage, intending to reuenge his owne death, if ſuch ſhould be his fatall diſaſter.
                  And as hee was in this extreamitie, Grumedan, who carried the ſtandard, and King Arban, were beaten downe before his face, and taken priſoners, whereat he became moſt impatient: and with all his force, would needs enter into the throng, to ſuccour them. But ſome of his (beeing more diſcreetly aduiſed) kept him backe, and finding meanes to get him into the Citie, and then ſhut vp the gates. So king Arauigne remained maſter of the field, not without great loſſe of his men, which yet were but few, in regarde of them belonging to king Liſuart: who found then by experience, what diſmall harme hee had endured, by giuing ouer-much credit to the perſawſions of Brocadan & Gandandell, by whoſe treacherous meanes, hee had baniſhed Amadis from his Court, and many other worthie Knights, for which he now intirely grieued: And not without good cauſe, conſidering what ſlender hope he had, to free himſelfe from the danger which round had engirt him.
                  By this time, king Arauigne, was withdrawne into the middeſt of his troupes, to take counſell; whether they ſhould (now inſtantly) aſſault the Citie, or deferre it till the morning. Now, as in ſuch affaires, opinions are diuerſe, ſo ſome gaue aduice to refreſh their people, already much wearied. Others ſpake to the contrarie, alleadging, that they ſhould not permit their enemies thus to rampire in themſelues, or let them take heart: but liuely, and without any delay, to followe vpon them, to encreaſe their feare, and weaken their courage. Wherupon king Arauigne commanded Barſinan, and the Duke of Briſtoy, to leade their troupes vp one ſide of the Citie, while he and his gaue the aſſault on the other, and that either ſide ſhould ſtriue for ſooneſt entrance. Then Drums and Trumpets ſounded the aſſault, and men (on all ſides) ran to the wals, where they found king Liſuart & his men, with the inhabitants of the Citie, that gaue them two or three ſtout repulſes, with Harquebuze ſ

                     e, Darts, and Crosbowes. All which diſcouraged not King Arauigne a iot, but rather did whette him on more and more, and had not darke night preuented them; king Liſuart had beene ſhrewdly enforced, and the Cittie ſurpriſed. But the obſcurity was ſo great, as they could not diſcerne one another: in regard whereof king Arauigne cauſed retreate to be ſounded, hoping to begin againe at the breake of day, or elſe, that they within the Citie, ſhould yeeld to his mercy.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XXIII.
                  
                     How Amadis came to the ſuccour of King Liſuart: And of the valiant ouerthnow of King Arauigne.
                     
                  
                  
                     BY the precedent chapter you haue heard, how the young Gentleman Eſplandian, & Sergill, hauing diſcouered the Armie of Arauigne, and doubting that king Liſuart was not ſtrong enough to fight with him: made a ſhort returne to Amadis, entreating his ſuccour, whereto he willingly yeelded. Notwithſtanding, hee could not proceed on ſo ſpeedily (albeit hee trauelled night and day) but King Liſuart was fallen into great perill of his perſon, as euer before had happened to him: which danger thus befell him, only by meanes of vnhappy guides, that conducted Amadis and his troupes, wandring (about mid-night) farre out of the way, without knowing where they were, which much diſpleaſed Amadis.
                  
                  Hereupon he demanded of them, if they were farre from the mountaine, or no. The guides anſwered, that in their opinion (conſidering how farre they had alreade gone) they could not bee neare: wherefore hee commanded Gandalin, to ride ſo farre on either ſide, as hee might reach ſome matter of diſcouery. Then he got vp on the higheſt part of all, to try, if hee could ſee the fire in king Arauignes Campe, beeing led all the way by one of the guides: and far they had not gone, but Gandalin deſcried the enemies fires in their Camp, which he ſhewed to the guide, demanding of him, if now hee could giue them better direction, without any more ſtraying, wherein he warranted him, & therefore bad him boldly followe him.
                  Returning backe to Amadis, they declared what they had ſeene: to his no little contentment, as hoping to take king Arauigne napping. Moreouer, he was partly deſirous, to let King Liſuart perceiue, how willing hee was (yet) to doe him ſeruice, notwithſtanding all his former hatred to him, and therefore rode on hard all the night. Yet could hee not ariue there ſo ſoone, but King Arauigne had begunne the aſſault againe, ſo ſharpe and hotly, as gaue great danger to them within the Citie, becauſe the enemies were become maſters of the principall part: by meanes whereof they entred in by ſuch numbers, as king Liſuart was compelled to betake himſelfe to a very little ſtreet or paſſage, being followed by ſome of his chiefeſt Knights, and there he reſolued to liue or die, rather then hee would yeeld himſelfe a priſoner to his proud foe.
                  Here began extreamitie to ſhew it ſelfe apparantly, for, like men deſpairing of any helpe or remidy, they declared ſuch manly deeds of Armes; as the Duke of Briſtoye & Barſinan, were much impeached in their hopes. On the other ſide, King Cildadan, Arquiſill, Flamian, and Norandell, who ſeemed to keep ſure the neareſt Cantons, founde Arauigne (that held them beſieged) ſuch hotte worke: as, but for ſixe Knights of the Iſle Sagittarie, hee had neuer gone any further. For,

the women and children of the Citie, were aloſt in the windowes, hurling downe boyling Lead, Oyle and water, as much perplexed him and them in their paſſage. Now did Norandell, and ſuch as were with him, fully perſwade them-ſelues, there to end their liues: yet not as cowards and recreants, but like true borne, bolde and couragious Knights. And hereupon, king Cildadan, ſtepping to one of them of the Sagittarte Iſle, ran his Sword vp to the hilts in his bodie, that downe he fell dead to the ground.
                  The ſight heereof was ſo dreadfull to the other fiue, that they beganne to retire, and king Cildadan, with them of his troupe, purſued them very ſtoutly: till king Arauignes forces came vppe to releeue them, and there the day had beene vtterly loſt, but for the freſh ſupply of Amadis, who was not a little diſmayed at his ariuall, to ſee the enemie haue ſuch aduantage of King Liſuart, whom hee greatly feared to be either ſlaine, or taken. Wherfore vowing a mercileſſe reuenge, he commanded all his horſemen to alight, and entring in vpon them pell mell, to cry aloud, Gaule, Gaule. When the other heard ſuch a ſudden tumultuous noyſe, and found themſelues ſo ſharpely charged in the rere: they plainely perceiued, that their attempt had failed, and all their hues to be in very great danger. So that King Arauigne, wholly diſcouraged, fied with Archalaus into a houſe, hoping there to ſtrengthen themſelues, and rather to die there, then yeeld to mercy. But they had not long ſtaied there, before King Liſuart came thither, and ſet vpon them ſo ſternely: that after ſome ſlender reſiſtance, they yeelded themſelues to be priſoners.
                  At the very ſame inſtant, Amadis met with the other fiue Knights of the Iſle Sagittarie, who fought againſt his people very boldly: but hee making againſt them, accompanied with Floreſtan and Angriote, at length ſurpriſed them, and commanded them to ſafe cuſtodie. Paſſing on further, they met with Barſinan and the Duke of Briſtoye, fighting manfully: yet they no ſooner ſaw Amadis, but they threw them-ſelues at his feete, defiring mercie, which hee would not denie them, and ſo committed them to Floreſtan. Now becauſe a great parte of King Arauignes Armie, had ſaued themſelues by flight into the neighbouring mountaines, and he found no further reſiſtance in the Citie: hee returned forth of the ſame gate whereat hee entred, and meeting with Gandalin, ſaid. Go I pray thee, and will Quedragant to retreate our people: for I would not be known to King Liſuart, and I meane to ſtay for him halfe a mile hence.
                  
                     Gandalin rode away preſently, & finding Quedragant, did his meſſage to him; who without any longer delay, cauſed retreat to bee ſounded, rallying all his troupes together. As thus they retired, king Liſuart could not preſume, how, or whence hee had receiued this high fauour, and therefore demanded of Guillan le Penſif, if hee knewe any thing in the caſe. Before God Sir (quoth he) he muſt needs be a deafe man that could not hear Gaul, Gaul, cried ſo many times this day; which may well aſſure you, that Amaedis, and no other, hath done you this vnexpected kindneſſe. I pray thee, ſaid the King, doe ſo much for me, as to finde and ſtay him, if it bee poſſible, that I may haue ſome conference with him.
                  So departed Guillan, who knew before, that Amadis was already

gone, wherfore, galloping the ſame way which he had takē: at laſt he ouertook him, & deliuered the Kings meſſage to him, aduiſing him to returne backe againe with him. Amadis perceiuing, that hee could not honeſtly gaine-ſay him, rode backe with him to King Liſuart, and alighting from his horſe, did him moſt humble reuerence: but the King imbracing him, declared manifeſt ſignes of great loue to him. At which inſtant, King Cildadan came to them, and many other Knights, with Floreſtan and Angriote, who were ſo louingly welcommed by king Liſuart, as it was impoſſible to be bettered. And as he was ſpeaking vnto them, Brandoyuas came to tell him, that the inhabitants of the Citie, made ſuch ſlaughter of king Arauignes people, as they would not admit any one man to mercie. But beleeue it Sir (quoth hee) it wery good to ceaſe this cruelty: for if their leaders haue not deſerued death, their followers in ſeruice ſhould not bee worſe entreated. Sir ſaid Amadis, giue order quickly to ſtay this proceeding, and content your ſelfe with the victory gotten againſt thē. Then the King called Norandell, and gaue him charge to command a retreate, that ſhedding of blood might be ſpared, and the reſt to be taken priſoners.
                  At that very time, an Eſquire ariued there from king Perion, to aduertiſe Amadis, that he was hard at hand, with the reſt of the Armie, to giue him ſuccour, if neede rerequired. Not now, anſwered Amadis, thankes be to heauen. And therefore Sir (quoth hee, to King Liſuart) you may well giue vs leaue to depart: to the end, that without any further trauaile, king Perion may ſend vs home againe. Before God, replied the King, although you haue been hitherto alwaies inuincible, yet ſhall you now bee ſo farre conſtrained by me, as to abide here for his comming hither: becauſe hee muſt needs partake in the ioy, which wee haue receiued by your meanes and ſuccour. Then, looking vpon king Cildadan, hee ſaid. Helpe mee (I pray you) with your entreatie, and trie whether your requeſt can more preuaile with him, then mine. Beleeue me, Lord Amadis, anſwered king Cildadan, you may not deny the King: conſidering he mooues the matter to you ſo earneſtly. Nor will I, ſaid hee, if my companions thinke it conuenient. What ſay you to it Lord Quedragant? you ought to obey the King, quoth hee, and ſeeing you haue done ſo much for him, doe more for him yet, if it bee in your power.
                  So was Amadis ſtayed there, and in this time of conference, king Arban and Grumedan, returned from their impriſonement, hauing eſcaped thence, with their hands bound hehinde them with ſtrong cordes: for their guardes, ſeeing what ſupplie Amadis had brought with him, betooke themſelues to flight, and ſo left them at their owne liberty. When king Liſuart ſaw them, neuer was man in greater ioy: becauſe hee was formerly perſwaded, that either they were ſlaine, or eiſe worſe wounded then they were, wherefore, with open armes he went and embraced them. And while he was buſied in theſe kindneſſes, they eſpied (a farre off) the Armie of king Perion come marching towards them, which Grumedan ſhewed to king Liſuart, ſaying. Sir, as I imagine, here is ſome new ſuccour comming to you: but if the firſt of Lord Amadis had tarried ſo

long, wee might haue ſhut the ſtable doore after the Steed was gone, according to the ancient Adage.
                  
                     Grumedan (anſwered king Liſuart, ſmiling) I know very wel, that whoſoeuer conteſts with you, in matters concerning the honour of Amadis, ſhall finde worke enough to doe: but much more, to defende himſelfe, if extreamity ſhould queſtion the caſe by weapons. Sir, ſaid Amadis, Lord Grumedan hath reaſon to wiſh mee well, for he hath neither friend or kinſman, that oweth him more dutie and obedient ſeruice, then I doe, and for ſuch a one (I am certaine) he will acknowledge and eſteeme me.
                  By this time, king Perion drew nearer and nearer, and thereupon, king Liſuart made forth to meete him, whereof Amadis aduertiſed him by Durin: wherefore he commanded his men to march a ſlowe pace, and taking Gaſtiles, Graſſandor, Brian de Moniaſte, and Tiron, with him, left Agraies to conduct the troupes, becauſe king Perion wel knew the ill-will he bare to king Liſuart, and feared leaſt diſcourteous language might paſſe between them at their meeting, whereby the purpoſed peace ſhould bee quite made fruſtrate. So the two Kings went to meete each other, giuing the ſpurre to their horſes, and embraced together very louingly, king Perion ſpeaking thus to king Liſuart. My Lord and brother, me thinkes your Armour is much impaired, ſince you departed from the camp: albeit, I am well aſſured, it lay not ruſting in your Armourie, while the fight laſted betweene your men and mine. And for ought I haue heard, they that brought it thus out of faſhion, haue receiued a payment beyond their expectation, and little to their liking.
                  So they haue, anſwered king Liſuart, thankes be giuen therefore to God, and the good helpe that you Amadis, and theſe other Knights brought mee, in ſo vrgent a neceſſitie, as I am ſure you haue heard already. In good faith, ſaid king Perion, I haue all my lifetime deſired, that my children might bee yours in peace and true amity. I hope, replied king Liſuart, that ſo they ſhall be before wee parte, and our kindneſſe neuer to faile, eſpecially on my behalfe. But ſeeing Prince Agraies not to be one among them: hee enquired expreſly for him, hauing vnderſtood his hatred towards him, and deſirous to reconcile him, and make him his friend, if poſſible it might be. Whereupon, king Perion made anſwere, that hee ſtayed behinde, as a conduct to the reſt of the Armie which followed. I pray you Sir, ſaid king Liſuart, that hee may bee ſent for, becauſe I purpoſe, not to parte from this place, before I haue both ſeene and embraced him. My Lord anſwered Amadis, then I my ſelfe will goe for him. It is well aduiſed (quoth king Liſuart) becauſe hee will doe more for you, then any other whatſoeuer.
                  So Amadis rode directly to Agraies, whom hee met not farre off, and tolde him what you haue heard already: earneſtly entreating him, that, forgetting all diſcontentment, hee would goe with him, and giue king Liſuart ſo good lookes as could be. My Lord and Coſen, ſaid Agraies, you know, that my liking or diſliking laſteth vpon your pleaſure, and I heartily deſire, that the ſuccour which you haue giuen him, of whom you ſpeake, may be better acknowledged, then all the better acknowledged, then all the former haue been. And further I aſſure you, I am content to requit

all the wrongs done to you, mee, and many more, meerely offered in deſpite of you, and without any occaſion at all.
                  Then they rode on together to King Liſuart, who, ſo ſoone as he ſaw Agraies, left all the reſt, going to embrace him, ſaying. Coſen, doe you thinke, this embracing as dangerous to me, as that was which you gaue mee, on the day of our laſt being together? Before God Sir, replied Agraies, I hope to find this much better then the other, for I was neuer (to my knowledge) in the like danger. We will talke therof ſaid the King, at better leaſure. But now you ſee the king my brother tarries for vs, let vs goe conduct him to Lubania, where I will make you all the beſt entertainement I can. So they returnd to king Perion, and tooke the way towards the Citie.
                  King Liſuart had receiued diuers wounds in his bodie, but the Chirurgions hauing ſeene them, gaue him hope of ſpeedy recouery: yet hee kept his bed ten daies together, beeing often viſited by the Princes and Lords of his owne country, as alſo the other: who, to delight him, had almoſt no other talke, but of the tricks and ſtratagems of Archalau
                           •
                        , by meanes whereof, hee compaſſed his purpoſes; eſpecially, when hee carried the Princeſſe Oriana away priſoner, and (after-warde) King Perion, Amadis., and Floreſtan, by the ſubtiltie of Dinarda; alſo, in what ſorte hee eſcaped from Galaor and Norandell, faining himſelfe to bee Branfiles, Coſengermaine to Grumedan. But moſt of all, his proiect plotted (by the helpe of Arauigne) againſt them all: which ſurely had preuailed, but that Amadis was the onely hinderance.
                  Such accidents, anſwered king Liſuart, doe often come to paſſe, by ſuch wicked wretches as hee is, who dare endanger themſelues in doing euill, and therein make their moſt delight: finding the entrance ſweete and eaſie, onely by the inſtigation of the Diuell, who depriues them of all apprehenſion, concerning what diſhonour may happen to them, beſide miſery of life, which makes death much more welcome to them, then life can be. As Arauigue himſelfe hath now ſome cauſe to confeſſe, being in the power of his chiefeſt enemies: and may well ſerue as an example to all other, that are to be taxed with the like vice.
                  As hee ended theſe wordes, the good olde Hermite Naſcian, came to them, who had ſoftly followed after king Perion, and finding the Princes in ſuch peaceable quietneſſe: praiſed God for it, and the good aduice of young Eſplandian, cauſing Amadis to depart ſo ſpeedily, when hee came to the reſcue of king Liſuart, as king Perion made knowen before them all. In troth, ſaide king Liſuart, I would gladly know, who gaue the youth ſo good counſell. Sir, replied Eſplandian, my father Naſcian ſent mee to you, to tell you, what hee had concluded with king Perion: but I could not finde you in the Campe, wherfore, Sergill & I, paſſing on further, diſcouered the Armie of king Arauigne, as they deſcended downe the mountaine. Then I called to mind, what I heard the Queene my Miſtreſſe ſay, at my parting from her, that hee was your enemy, and fearing what afterwards happened to you, I made haſte to aduertiſe Lord Amadis, to the end hee might giue you ſuccour, as he did. Before God ſweet youth (ſaide king Liſuart) I

ſhall not (while I liue) forgette ſo great a bleſſing happening to mee: And folding Eſplandian in his arms, ſweetly kiſſed him on the cheeke.
                  At that time, king Gaſquilan was brought thither, in a Litter, hauing ſoftly followed, as beeing vnable to ſit on horſebacke, by reaſon of the ſhrewd fall hee had, when he would needes trie his manhood againſt Amadis, on the firſt day when the two battailes met. Into a reſerued chamber hee was conducted, by ſome of the chiefe in the companie, eſpecially Amadis, who came & ſaluted him, ſaying. Sir, I would gladly ſee you in farre better diſpoſition, than now you are: but by the grace of heauen, your health may bee as ſoone reſtored, as your harme happened. Gaſquilan thanked him with all his heart, yet did not know him, becauſe hee had neuer ſeen him vnarmed: which king Arban obſeruing, ſaid. Sir, I think you knowe not the Knight that talketh with you, yet you haue often heretofore heard of him: this is Amadis de Gaule, againſt whom (ſome few dayes ſince) you made your proofe.
                  Much amazed was Gaſquilan, ſeeing his countenance (as hee imagined) more meete to court faire Ladies, then to endure the harde toyles of knighthood: and if hee had not made the triall which hee did, hee ſhould hardly haue giuen credit to the renowne euery where noyſed of him, whereupon he thus replied. I ſweare to you, Lord Amadis, vpon my faith, that you are the Knight I haue moſt deſired to ſee, ſince I began to beare Armes, not for any good will I bare you: but to fight with you, euen to the death, if this miſhap had not befallen mee, as now it is too well knowne. For, if fortune had ſo much fauoured me, as to haue giuen mee, what you haue gotten ouer me: beſide the glory, of conquering the only moſt happy knight in the world, I ſhould haue wonne the loue of one, whō I affect much better then my ſelfe, and by whoſe command, I came twice to ſee you in this countrie, with ſuch miſadaduenture, as I haue cauſe to lament all the dayes of my life, becauſe I haue loſt (by you) all hope of euer enioying her. Sir, ſaid Amadis, your honour had beene but ſlenderly augmented, by ouercomming mee, after ſuch plenty of worthie actions, by you performed. And as for her, whom you hold as loſt through mine occaſion, if ſhe be a woman of good iudgement, as doubtleſſe ſhee is: it is impoſſible, but ſhe muſt needs loue you anſwerable to your merit, and as one of the beſt Knights this day b

                  Theſe gracious wordes, ſo highly ſatisfied King Gaſquilan, as hee extended foorth his armes to embrace him: and inſtantly they were made friends, Amadis keeping him daily company, ſo long as hee ſoiourned in the Citie of Lubania, where Arquiſill alſo yeelded him-ſelfe priſoner, to fulfill the promiſe hee had formerly made. But Amadis, who held the gentle Knight in high eſteme, freed him from all further ſubmiſſion, and promiſed him his hand for chuſing him Emperour, before they parted thence together: by meanes of the Archbiſhop

                        cona, Brandaiell de Rocque, and others, that were priſoners in the Encloſed Iſle. Of whom (quoth he) I will earneſtly ſolicite this matter, that (for my ſake) they will affoord you this fauour: & which (I hope) they cannot deny mee, knowing none more neare in blood, and fitter for the Empire, they you are.
                  When Arquiſill heard theſe wordes, hee was moſt ioyfull: well knowing the conſpiracies of them of Rome, to make election of another, wherein they would very hardly proceed, without the fauour of Lord Amadis, and therefore, hee ſaid. My Lord, you haue heretofore done me ſo many honourable fauours, as I muſt needes confeſſe my ſelfe wholly yours. And ſo much the rather, in ſeeking thus my further aduancement, which comming ſo to paſſe: you ſhall diſpoſe both of it and me, as holding all of you onely, and none other. Referre all care thereof (quoth Amadis) to me alone.
                  Proceeding on to further ſpeeches, they entred into a lodging, where Gandalin had the charge of Archalaus and King Arauigne, 
                     
                        •
                     inthem laid vpon a bedde, wondrous melancholie: wherefore Amadis demanded of them, whereon they thought? What art thou (quoth Archalaus) that wouldeſt know our thoughts? How? ſaid Amadis, doſt thou not knowe Amadis de Gaule, whom thou haſt threatned ſo many times? I am hee that ſpeakes to thee. When Archalaus heard him, hee beganne to note him better than before, and remembring that he had formerly ſeene him, thus anſwered. Beleeue mee, I thinke thou ſpeakeſt truth, and although length of time hath partly taken thee out of my knowledge: yet I am perſwaded, thou art the ſame man that I had in my priſon at Valderin, where thy youth & cōplexion could ſo much commande mee, that the pittie I then tooke on thee, hath brought me now into ſuch diſtreſſe, as conſtraines me to craue mercy of thee. Mercy? ſaid Amadis, I knowe not how thou canſt expect that from mee, conſidering thou couldſt nebeſtowe it on thy ſelfe: for, if ſuch had beene thy power, long agoe thou wouldſt haue ended a world of cruelties, that haue beene thy continuall exerciſe. Neuertheleſſe, if thou couldeſt repent, and (with an honeſt ſoule) promiſe me neuer to vſe the like againe; I could find in mine heart to pardon thee.
                  Truſt mee, anſwered Archalaus, it is a worke very hard for me to do, almoſt impoſible, for there I knew continually how to conquer, and euermore tooke ſuch delight in doing ill; as now I cannot eaſily addict my ſelfe to goodneſſe. But neceſſity, which is a bridle ſharp and rigorous, to metamorphoſe all bad cuſtomes into vertue: happily will conſtraine my older yeares (ſeeing the eſtate wherein I am) to follow thoſe courſes, which my youth & liberty then diſd
                        ••
                     ned to do. What other ranſom then, replied Amadis, ſhall I haue of thee, to let thee goe? All my Caſtles (quoth hee) and other goods, by meanes wherof I purſued a great part of thoſe vices, for which thou iuſtly doeſt reprooue me. Leaue me only what ſhall like thy ſelfe to doe, for the remainder of my life; & if thou grant mee ſo much grace: it may be, this onely bounty will beget in me, that which reaſon heretofore could neuer compaſſe. Beleeue me, ſaid Amadis, thine owne confeſſion of ſo lewde a life, and hope I haue of thine amendment: ſhall be the key

to free thy ſoule from thy bodies thraldome, hauing ſo long a time engaged them both to the Diuell.
                  So hee turned his face, to goe from him: but Archalaus called him againe, and pointing to Arauigne, ſaid. I pray thee Amadis, looke vpvpon this wretched King, who (not long ſince) was neere hand to bee one of the greateſt Princes in the world: but in a moment, the ſame fortune which (befoore) ſhewed amiable lookes, hath beaten him downe, and wholly wrought his ruine. An obſeruation not vnmeet for thee, for thou, and all other, that aſpire vnto the higheſt degree of happineſſe, art ſubiect to the like disfauours. And becauſe to vanquiſh and pardon, are moſt familiar to noble and magnanimous mindes: beſtowe on vs now ſuch entertainement, as thou wouldeſt wiſh to receiue from vs, wee holding the place, as now thou doeſt, and from which thou canſt not alwaies warrant thy ſelfe.
                  More account did Amadis make of theſe good words, than of him that ſpake them, and well vnderſtood the end whereat hee aimed, although hee would make no outwarde ſhew thereof: but, without any further conteſtation, left him, departing thence to his owne lodging, to diſpatch Ardan the dwarffe to Oriana, that ſhee might knowe the warres finiſhing, as alſo what-ſoeuer had paſſed between the Princes and Lords in the two Camps. Moreouer, hee gaue him a Letter, directed to Yſanio, whereby he gaue order: that Brandaiell de Rocque, the Marqueſſe of Ancona, the Archbiſhoppe of Tarente, and the other Romaine priſoners, ſhould bee ſent to him. So departed the Dwarffe, who trauailed day and night, vntill he ariued at the Pallace of Apolidon.
                  
                  Hee preſently ſent worde to the Princeſſe, byone of her womē, that hee would ſpeake with her from Amadis. Shee no ſooner heard of his ariuall, but fearing ſome vnhappy fortune; became ſo afflicted in mind, that ſhe trembled exceedingly: knowing, that victory could not fauour either of the Campes, but it would procure ſorrow and griefe to her all her lifetime. Then Ardan entred her chamber, who dedeclared by his looks, that ſhe had no cauſe of ſadneſſe, or melancholie. Neuertheleſſe, ſo ſoone as ſhe ſaw him (not hauing ſo much patience, as to let him deliuer his meſſage) with teares in her eyes, ſhe ſaid vnto him. Alaſſe my deare friend Ardan, tell mee I pray thee quickly, in what eſtate haſt thou left the King my father, and is thy Maſter aliue or dead: dead? Madame, anſwered the Dwarffe, they neuer (in their liues) were ſo merrie together.
                  Then he reported to her, all that which you haue heard already, eſpecially, in what great danger King Liſuart was, when Amadis came with his happy ſuccour. Alſo, his royall entertainement to King Perion, and laſtly, what loue he expreſſed to Eſplandian, by whoſe means, Amadis, came to the reſcue of them of Great Brittaine: which gaue ſuch comfort to Oriana, that lifting vp her eyes and hands to heauen, ſhee ſpake ſo loude as all preſent might heare her. O moſt mercifull God, bleſſed for euer be thy diuine bounty, ſhouring downe thus thy pitie vpon thy poore ſeruant, and that happy childe, who hath beene the occaſion of this great goodnes. Oh, let thy mercy yet further permit, that all thoſe eſpeciall predictions, which the wiſe Vrganda deliuered of him, may not faile in him. All the Ladies there preſent, perſwaded

themſelues, that ſhee vſed theſe wordes of Eſplandian, for the helpe which hee had procured to King Liſuart: yet were ignorant of her further intereſt in him, which wiſely ſhe concealed to her ſelfe.
                  Afterward, ſhee demaunded of Ardan, if he came thither about any other buſineſſe. Madame (quoth hee) I haue Letters from my Lord, directed to the Gouernour Yſanio, commanding him by mee, forth-with to ſend him the Romaine priſoners. What way then, ſaide ſhee, will he take, and the King alſo? Madame, quoth hee, for ought I can vnderſtand, they will not part each from other, till all differences are fully concluded. Honeſt Dwarffe, ſaid the Queene Sardamira, tell me I pray thee, how haue the Romaines behaued themſelues: are many of them ſlaine in the battaile? Madame, anſwered Ardan, a great number of them haue ended their daies valiantly, and (well neere) all the reſt are ſore wounded: but ſince the death of the Emperour, Floyan and Conſtant, no man of name (that I knowe) hath periſhed among thē, but was liuing, when I parted from the Campe, where I left Arquiſill in ſerious conference with my Maſter. As for your brother Flamyan, he beginneth to growe ſtrong, and woundes are (in a manner) cured.
                  Ardan hauing receiued expreſſe charge from Amadis, to make ſo little tarrying there as could be: demanded of Oriana, if ſhee pleaſed to command any thing to his Maſtes? Doe my moſt humble comdations (quoth ſhe) to king Perion of Gaule, Agraies, Bruneo, and Amadis, to whom I purpoſe not to write, becauſe thou broughteſt me no Letter from him. So the dwarffe took leaue of her, and went to find Yſanio, giuing him the Letters from his Maſter, and deliuering his further meſſage beſide. Whereupon, Yſanio tooke ſuch order, that before the week was expired: the Romanes were all ariued at Lubania, in preſence of King Liſuart, and the other Princeſſe and Lords. But Amadis calling them into his chamber, & being there alone with them, ſpake thus.
                  Lords, I am ſure you are not ignorant, what iſſure this warre hath ſorted to, by meanes whereof, almoſt all the Princes of the Eaſt, & they likewiſe of the Weſt, haue entred into Armes. And becauſe we are now vpon tearmes, for a perpetuall peace, I hold it reaſonable, that albeit you are my priſoners: yet nothing ſhall be concluded till firſt it be imparted to you. Now, as this is the reaſon of your calling hither; ſo am I like wiſe to entreat you, that (for my ſake) you would accept and elect Lord Arquiſill as your Emperour. For ouer and beſide, that there is not to bee found (as I heare) any man more neare in birth to the Empire, then hee: ſo am I well acquainted with his high deſerts, which mooues me the more (in his behalfe) to bee thus earneſt with you. In the dooing whereof you ſhall be get your ſelues two eſpeciall graces. The firſt, by calling to the gouernement of ſo excellent a Monarchie, a Prince wiſe, valiant, & vertuous, for your better conſeruation, and entertaining you in all loue and kindneſſe. The other, that in my endeared affection to him, I freely giue you (with him) liberty, and all ſuch ranſomes, as are due to me from you, continuing moreouer (while I liue) your affectionate friend. aduiſe therefore with your ſelues, what anſwere you will make me: to the end, I may alſo conſider, how I

ſhall carrie my ſelfe to you, in matter of ſo important occaſion.

                  So they withdrew thence, to go finde Flamyan in his lodging: for (as yet) hee kept his chamber, not healed of the hurts, which hee had receiued in the laſt encounter. Then they declared to him, what ſpeeches had paſt betweene them and Amadis, what offers and promiſes hee had made, in fauour of Arquiſill, and laſtly, the anſwere they returned him. Beleeue mee, ſaide Elamyan, Lord Amadis ſpeaketh like a good Knights, and no more, then all wee ought to take in good part, and allowe of very worthily.

your wife, leauing her as mine heire (after my deceaſe) to my kingdome of Great Brittaine. Then Amadis more glad and highly pleaſed, then euer before, falling on his knee, moſt humbly thanked him. Well Sonne, ſaid the King, let it not offend you, if I entreat olde Naſcian to tell the Emperour, how Eſplandian was begotten, and whoſe Son hee is: that euery one may know, how the marriage of you and Oriana was long ſince contracted. The Hermite beeing preſent to ſatisfie the Kings requeſt, declared all the precedent fortunes, and the promiſe paſt betweene Amadis and the Princeſſe, whereby Eſplandian became his ſonne.
                  We neede make no doubt, concerning the inwarde ioy of the noble youth, beeing ignorant (till then) whoſe ſonne he was. Wherupon, King Liſuart called him, and auouched him for his Grand-child before them all, to the no little contentment of Amadis: who knowing the Emperours minde, & how deſirous hee was, to enioy Orianaes ſiſter in mariage, ſpake thus to king Liſuart. Sir, ſeeing you haue giuen mee that, which aboue all things elſe in this world, I moſt deſired: let mee likewiſe moſt humbly entreate you, to giue the Princeſſe Leonora to the Emperour, and then his ioy will be equall to mine. By my troth, anſwered the King, this good motion ſhall neuer be denied, if hee will haue it ſo. Then I take your highneſſe at your word, replied Arquiſill. And I giue her you, quoth the King, with all mine heart. Moreouer, I will bring her with me to the Encloſed Iſle, that both theſe mariages may bee there accompliſhed together. To morrow I purpoſe to parte hence for Vindiliſore, where ſhe keepeth company with my Queen. In the meane while, you may expect mee at the Pallace of Apolidon, whither my kingly brother may ſend for Galaor: and becauſe nothing elſe may be omitted, to compleate our ioy and contentment, I will ſend for my Coſen Galuanes, & Madaſima. The Marſhalls of the lodgings, appertaining to the Kings Liſuart and Perion: gaue preſent order for their departure, the one ſide to the Encloſed Iſle, and the other to Vindiliſore.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. XXIIII.
                  
                     How King Liſuart ariued at Vindiliſore, where his Queen Briſenia attended his comming; whom (ſoone after) he cauſed to remoue thence, and with her daughter Leonora, accompany him to the Encloſed Iſle.
                     
                  
                  
                     AFter that King Liſuart was diſlodged from the Citie of Lubania, accompanied with the reſt of his Armie, hee iournied ſo expeditiouſly, that hee ariued at Vindiliſore; where his Queene Briſenia expected his comming, according to former intelligence ſent her. And although hee was greatly perplexed in minde, ſeeing his reputation much impaired, by thoſe disfouours receiued from fortune, notwithſtanding the agreement hee had made with Amadis: yet neuertheleſſe (like a wiſe and iudicious Prince) hee diſſembled his griefe, ſhewing much

better outwarde carriage, then otherwiſe willingly hee would haue done. And his owne knowledge was no meane incitation thereto, by hourely preſſing his conſcience, with a ſenſible apprehenſion, that hee had beene the onely cauſe, of ſhedding (ouer-prodigally) ſo much Chriſtian blood: vnder an vniuſt colour of reuenge, which he preferred before all counſell and aduice, giuen him by the Princes and Lords of his Land, wherewith our Lord being iuſtly offended, had ſcourg'd him with there rods, not to make him murmur or gruge againſt him, but rather to thank him, for inflicting no heauier vengeāce on him
                  In meditation of theſe matters, hee went to the Queenes lodgings, and ſhe being before aduertiſed by Brandoynas, of all that had happened in his voyage; welcommed him moſt graciouſly, and looking vpon young Eſplandian, who followed next to the King: folding him in her armes, & ſweetly kiſſing him, thus ſhe ſpake. My worthie ſonne, bleſſed bee the houre of thy birth, hauing (in thy young dayes) done ſuch ſeruice to the King: as, but by thy good aduiſe (as I haue vnderſtood) he had neuer ſeene his owne kingdome any more. Madame, anſwered the King, I hope, ſeeing hee hath begun ſo well: not any one houre ſhall paſſe him, but will encreaſe in him both will and power, of proceeding on better & better. For I aſſure you, that beſide the right of nature, which iuſtly incites mee to wiſh him well: no day can paſſe ouer my head, but I muſt needs confeſſe a perticuliar affection to him, for the great happineſſe I enioy by him.
                  While thus the King and Queen conferred together, concerning Eſplandian, the other Princes and Lords were kindely entertained by the Ladies & Gentlewomen: who beeing curious in inquiry, how the fights had beene performed, betweene the Kings people, and them belonging to Amadis, were a long while without any other language. But when they heard of the purpoſed marriages, & that they muſt likewiſe goe to the Encloſed Iſle: this raiſed much more pleaſure in them, then the recitall of colde feares and Alarums, whereon they wholly conferred before. For now, one made full account, to try the Arch of loyall louers; others the Defended chamber, and the other ſingularities in the Iſle, and in theſe delightes they ſpent the whole day.
                  But the houre of reſt beeing come, the King withdrew into the Queenes chamber, where being alone by themſelues, hee began in this maner. Madame, if you found your ſelfe much amazed, when you heard the matters concerning your daughter and Amadis: beleeue no leſſe of me, when I heard the firſt newes thereof. And by that which I knew afterwarde, both you and I were farre off from our reckonning. For, perſwade your ſelfe, it is no little diſturbance to my minde, that I could not know theſe things, before the ſcandall was diſcouered, and nothing euer touched mee ſo nearely, eſpecially, the loſſe of ſo many worthie Knights, who had now beene liuing, and periſhed in theſe vnhappy wars, which breeds in me ſuch remorſe of conſcience, as you, or any other, will hardly credit: but matters already paſt, are ouer-late to bee remedied. Wherefore, I purpoſe now, that what yet remaineth to be done, ſhall bee performed with our very vttermoſt honour. Forgetting the offence of our daughter, who made choyce

of a husband at her owne pleaſure: yet one that well deſerues her, & a better. For I neuer ſaw any Knight errant, that could winne himſelfe ſo many friends, or haue ſuch a multitude of Kings, Princes, and potent Lords at his comande: whereby it plainely appeareth, that Fortune is dipoſed to preferre him, before any other.
                  And becauſe at my parting from Lubania, I promiſed, to bring you with mee to the Encloſed Iſle, there to conſummate the mariage betweene her and him: I pray you giue order for all things, which you thinke requiſite in ſuch caſes. Alſo, for the conduct thither of your daughter Leonora, whom (vpon his owne requeſt) I haue giuen as wife to the new Emperour. Very ioyfull was the Queene, to ſee the King ſo well diſpoſed: eſpecially towardes her daughter Oriana, which was the thing ſhee moſt deſired. In regard whereof, and to maintaine him in this good minde, ſhe ſaide. Sir, it ſeemeth to mee, that heauen hath beene very gracious to you and me, beſtowing ſuch alliance on vs, in fauour of whom, their friends ſhall for euer hereafter be ours. What elſe remaineth to bee done, referre all to mee, for all ſhall bee ordered to your contentment. Hereupon, earely the next morning, ſhee ſent for Arban, King of Norwales, Great maiſter of the Kings houſholde, to whom ſhe gaue the charge of all.

                     How King Perion (and his companie) tooke their way towardes the Encloſed Iſle: And of that which they did, before King Liſuart came thither to them.
                  
                  
                     AFter that they of Great Brittaine were gone from Lubania: King Perion and his Armie marched backe to the Encloſed Iſle, where Oriana expected their comming, newly aduertiſed by Gandalin, what concluſion was made with king Liſuart. So ſoone as they were there ariued, they went to ſee her, and Amadis preſented the Emperour Arquiſill to her (whom ſhe had neuer ſeene before) ſaying. Madame, as yet you know not this Knight: but he is in good hope, to be nearer in kinred to you, then you imagine. By theſe words ſhe plainely vnderſtood, that he was the Emperour, wherefore (raiſing her ſelfe) ſhee went and did him reuerence, as hee did the like to her, & with a very Princely grace, ſaid. Madame, I am ſo much beholding to Lord Amadis, that both you and hee may diſpoſe of me, and whatſoeuer is in my power, at your pleaſure. My Lord, anſwered the Princeſſe, I know what & who you are: wherefore, I moſt humbly beſeech you, that (hence forward) you would reckon mee, as one of your beſt ſiſters, and kinde friends.
                  During this time, Agraies, Floreſtan, Quedragant, & Brian gaue curteous ſalutaions to Queene Sardamira, Graſinda and Olinda, and Bruneo de bone Mer, to his moſt dearely affected Melicia. But Amadis obſeruing Graſandor, ſonne to the King of Bohemia, ſtanding by the Infanta Mabila, ſo rauiſhed in ſoule with loue to her, that accuſtomed

feare in ſuch affaires, cloſed vp his mouth, not daring to deliuer ſo much as on ewo
                        •
                     d: cauſed him to call his Coſen, and thus he rounded her in the eare. Madame, you know that Graſandor loues you more thē himſelf, yet you appear ouermuch to neglect him, I pray you ſpeake to him: for well I knowe that you beeing ſicke of the ſame diſeaſe, and many times in the like extreamity, would (euen gladly as hee) finde eaſe in the like tormenting affliction, therefore, to your mercy I recommend him.
                  Shee knowing, that Amadis was ſhot in the ſame place, where this loue-ſicke paine oppreſſed her, euen as violently to another, as ſhee to Graſandor: began to bluſh in ſuch ſtrange manner, as all preſent did apparantly perceiue it, and gheſt at the cauſe of her alteration. Yet to couer it ſo well as ſhee could; ſhe made anſwere to Amadis, that ſhee would obey his commande: And he taking her by the hand, wēt with her to Graſandor preſently, ſaying. See Sir, heere is a Lady, that findes fault with ſeeing you ſo melanchollie. Let me intreate you my Lord, to yeeld her ſome reaſon, how and from whence your affliction enſueth: and ſo hee left them together. Graſandor finding opportunity to fauour him, and that now he might freely vtter his minde to her: between hope and feare, kindneſſe and conſtraint, thus hee began.
                  Madame, it ſeemes to mee, that Lord Amadis findes the ſame paſſions in mee, as him ſelfe ſuffered, when loue allured him (at the firſt) to like Madame Oriana. And to ſpeake no more then truth, when I thinke to impart my oppreſſions to you, the three principall organes of my life, are in moſt ſtrange and vnuſuall diſtemper: namely, mine eyes, my heart, and my tongue. For ſo ſoone as mine eyes can but ga
                        •…
                     e a ſight of you: they incite ſpeech, onely to tell you the cauſe of my griefe; but all in vaine. Then my tongue, hoping to ſupply that defect: openeth my mouth, but feare preuailing, quickly cloſeth it vp againe. If then my heart be in heauy martyrdome, I leaue to your owne iudgement, ſpeaking (as it doth) by continuall fighing. And finding it ſelfe vn-furniſhed of all helping meanes: checks mine eyes, for bringing home the firſt tydings of your bright beauty. Then they, in excuſing their errour: promiſe to performe the tongues office, becauſe it is dumbe in your preſence, and by outward appearance (ſhewing it ſelfe pitifull) would begge of you mercy and remedy.
                  While Graſandor continued theſe complaints, Amadis (not knowing how he ſhould raiſe the ſiege, the Emperor ſtill talking with Oriana:) ſaw Queene Briolania enter the chamber, whom hee going to kiſſe, called the Emperour, ſaying. My Lord, you haue not yet ſeen all the beauties in this goodly beauty, as here Queene Briolania may teſtifie to you. Before God (quoth hee) you ſay very true. So leauing Oriana to ſalute the Queene: ſhe ſeemed ſo faire in his eye, and her behauiour ſo gracious, that hee vſed theſe wordes to her. I am perſwaded Madame, that Apolidon, in creating the ſingularities of this place, left them in ſuch rich perfection, only for the honour of excelling Ladies. For I can repute them no other then immortall, and make men tractable, to abide (heere all their life time) among ſuch rauiſhing beauties.
                  Now did Amadis ſteppe into the

Emperours place, ſo ſoone as hee was gone from Oriana, feigning to doe him a great fauour, in helping him to conferre with Queene Briolania. But he had a quite contrary meaning, and did it to no other end, but that the reſt of his friends ſhould talke with their Ladies, while hee might be alone with her whom hee moſt deſired. For hee had not conuerſed familiarly with the Princeſſe, ſince her ariuall in the Encloſed Iſle: wherefore, finding time and place ſufficiently commodious, he beganne with her in this manner.
                  Madame, I haue thought all my life time hitherto, that no poſſibility remained in mee for acknowledgement of thoſe great and gracious fauours, which (ſo long a while) I haue receiued by your meanes only. And laſt of all, in being the cauſe that aged Naſcian reuealed to the King your father, what right wee had each in other: whereby your ſonne and mine became knowen to him, and peace confirmed, between them of Great Brittaine and vs. As for my ſelfe, I ſhall ſtand much more obliged to you now, then euer heretofore: And therefore, aduiſedly conſider what elſe remaineth for me to doe, for I aſſure you, I ſhall take no little delight, in doing whatſoeuer you commande me.
                  When Oriana heard him deliuer ſuch ſpeeches, hauing before her eyes, what dutie euery woman of honour and diſcretion, oweth to her husband; ſhee thus anſwered. My Lord, in my poore opinion, you doe both your ſelfe and me wrong, and therefore I pray you, ſpeake to me henceforward, as to your hūble wife & ſeruant: and not after thoſe kind of phraſes, whē I was no other then your friend. Furthermore, let mee humbly entreat you to tell me, in what condition you left the King my father, and how I am now eſteemed of him? Madame, ſaid Amadis, if outward lookes may be true euidences, I neuer ſaw man declare more contentment, then he deliuered when we were together. Albeit I coniecture (conſidering his ineuitable danger in our laſt encounter, when he hoped to recouer you from vs by meer force) his thoughts are otherwiſe quite different. Yet hee diſſembles it ſo wiſely as poſſibly can bee, euen to hurle ſhame vpon himſelfe, and excuſing what hath paſt betweene you and mee: fully reſolued (as hee ſaith) to bee more cheerefully diſpoſed, then euer hitherto he hath been. Where-upon hee is returned backe to Vindiliſore, to fetch the Queene and your ſiſter Leonora, whom he hath promiſed in marriage to the Emperour.
                  
                     Oriana was not a little glad of theſe newes, ſaying. My Lord, theſe are matters of no meane comfort, eſpecially, that I haue recouered my fathers grace againe: for, next to you, I loue him aboue any man liuing, notwithſtanding, all the hard ſufferings (as well you know) hee hath put me to. But further I pray you tell mee, what is your opinion of Eſplandian? By my faath Madame, quoth hee, by his carriage and behauiour, he plainely declares himſelfe to bee yours: And if good Naſcian could haue preuailed, hee had brought him hither to you. But the King would needs haue him goe with him, to pleaſe the Queene, becauſe ſhee knowes him not yet to bee her Grand-childe.
                  So, breaking off this diſcourſe, King Perion, who had all this while entertained Graſinda with talke:

tooke leaue of her and the company, becauſe it drew neare ſupper time. Wherefore, withdrawing thence into his owne lodging, Amadis followed him: & there, looking forth at a windowe, till the tables were furniſhed, hee thus ſpake. Seeing ſonne it hath pleaſed God, that you haue ended all troubles, with ſo great honour: let the whole glory be aſcribed to him, and while you liue, acknowledge thankfulneſſe to your friends, who to help you in ſo ſerious a buſineſs, haue made no ſpare of their liues and goods, which bindes you the more to loue and honour them, recōpencing their kindneſſe ſo much as in you lieth. Conſidering, that without their aſſiſtance, it is moſt certaine, you had beene in great danger, not only of your liues loſſe, but alſo of your honour, which I account a thouſand times dearer. And becauſe it is no more then reaſon, that, like as they haue beene pertakers of all paines and perils, ſo they ought to be of pleaſure and contentment, which you haue receiued by their meanes: let it therfore be no meane part of your care, to reſpect them in eſpecial manner, by diſtributing ſuch booty among them, as is in your hands, the Kings Aranigne, Barſinan, & others being your priſoners.
                  Moreouer, ſuch as you knowe affected to thoſe Ladies, which keepe companie with the Princeſſe Oriana: let them haue equal cōtentment with your ſelfe, by eſpouſing them, to whom their fancies are enclined. For which cauſe, I deliuer into your power, your ſiſter Melitia, to giue her to him whom you thinke worthieſt of her. You haue likewiſe your Coſen Mabila, and the Queen Bri
                           •
                        lania, to whom you ſtand highly obliged. Graſinda alſo, and the Queen Sardamira, who haue ſuffered a great parte of Orianaes ſorrowes: me thinks they ſhould participate in her faireſt fortune, and be aduanced as you think meeteſt. Aſſuring you, that the greateſt comfort I can haue in mine aged yeares, is, to ſee your brethren Galaor and Floreſtan married, that before I depart this life, I may reioyce in iſſue from you all. Conſider hereof I pray you aduiſedly; & further what I haue ſaid, to your vttermoſt power. My Lord anſwered Amadis, I will doe all that lies in me, to pleaſe both you & them. It is enough, quoth the King. And ſo all things beeing aptly ordered, they ſate downe to ſupper.
                  In the morning, a ſudden ſummons was ſent to all the chiefe Knights, for an immediate meeting: and when they were aſſembled, Amadis entred into theſe ſpeeches. Honourable Gentlemen & friends, the great and labourious trauaile, which you haue endured in theſe late warres: doth very well deſerue, that now you ſhould giue eaſe and reſpite to your ſpirits, and in regarde of the deare debt, wherein I ſtand engaged to you, to eſſay my vttermoſt meanes, to let you enioy thoſe beatitudes, which (I know) are pleaſing to euery man among you. For, as by your moſt gracious aſſiſtance, afforded in my very neereſt extreamity, I haue attained to that, which I eſteemed aboue all things elſe in the world, namely, the peaceable enioying of my long loued Oriana: Euen ſo, I beſeech you (with all my heart) that each man would inſtantly declare, if hee ſtand affected to any Ladie or Gentlewoman heere, for I aſſure you, on the faith of a Knight, to preuaile ſo farre as I can with them, that they ſhall not eaſily deny, what I

entreat on their friends behalfe.
                  Moreouer, you know that king Aranigne, Barſidan, and many other beſide, are our priſoners, defying thoſe gracefull vertues, whereto the order of knighthood truely tyed them, and exerciſing (ſo much as in them lay) all cruelties and tyranny. In regarde whereof, they are not worthie of any ranſome, but iuſtly puniſhable, for the grieuouſneſſe of their treaſons: and therefore I thinke it fit, that conſideration ſhould be vſed, for diuiding their eſtates & goods amongyou. As for my ſelfe, I deny any part or portion belonging to mee, holding my ſelfe ſufficiently ſatiſfied, if I can compaſſe any means, of doing you any perticular pleaſure or ſeruice.
                  When they that were not meanly affected to their Ladies, heard him vſe theſe wordes, and knewe what power he had to forward them that way: you may well imagine, that they did not lende any deaffe 
                        •
                     are to ſuch a pleaſing motion, eſpecially, Agraies, who earneſtly entreated him, to giue his honourable furtherance, for his marriage with the faire Olinda, Bruneo with Melicia, Graſandor with Mabila, and Quedragant, who neuer loued till then, declared his affection to Graſinda, ſaying. I now ſufficiently vnderſtand, that youth and time haue (heretofore) been contrary to my quiet, hauing then no other care, but for the managing of my Horſe and Armes: but at this inſtant, yeares and reaſon conſtraines mee to another kinde of condition, ſo that if it like Madame Graſinda, to accept me as her husband, I ſhal account my happineſſe equall to any mans, of what condition ſoeuer he be.
                  Before God, ſaid Floreſtan, I was once determined, to returne into Aliemaine, ſo ſoon as the buſineſſe concerning my Lord Amadis was ended, as well to ſee my mother, as many other mine endeared friends. Neuertheleſſe, I know not with what eie I obſerued the Queen Sardamira, but this I am well aſſured, that if I could compaſſe the meanes to marrie her; I ſhould eaſily forget mine intended voyage, and all things elſe whatſoeuer. But others, more free from loues imperious ſubiection, hauing their mindes wholly addicted to follow Armes: ſpake in a quite contrary language, deſiring Amadis, to imploy them in the conqueſt of Arauignes kingdome, the countries belonging to Barſinan, or any where elſe. And we requeſt (quoth they) no other part of booty, but the means of winning renowne, honour and Chiualrie.
                  Hereupon, Amadis returned thē anſwere. Seeing you are of this diſpoſition: with the good liking of the company, I will make a preſent diuiſion. On Quedragant, I beſtowe the countrie of Sanſuega, for his larger portion in marrying with Graſinda. To you Bruneo, I giue the kingdom of Arauigne, with my ſiſter Melicia. And as for my brother Floreſtan, I will worke ſo with the Emperour: that hee ſhall giue him the countrie of Calabria, with the Queen Sardamira, whom hee ſo dearely affecteth. As for my Lord Agraies, and Graſandor, they are (thankes bee to God) rich and mighty enough, by means of their fathers, & will content themſelues (as I thinke) to enioy thoſe beauties that affect them. What elſe remaineth, ſhall be diſtributed particularly, according to the merit of euery man, ſo ſoon as King Liſuart ſhall be heere ariued. Which they

all liked well, and ſo we leaue them returning to their lodgings: attending the time, when they ſhould goe and conuerſe with their Ladies, according to their wonted cuſtome.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXVI.
                  
                     How Bruneo de bonno Mer and Branfill, were appointed to iourney into Gaule, to fetch the Queene Elyſena and Galaor, and of thoſe aduentures that happened to them in their returning back againe.
                  
                  
                     SOme fewe dayes after that K. Perion, and the other Knights were come to the encloſed Iſle; Agraies, Brunco, and they that had hope of ſpeedie marriage, fearing leaſt the abſence of the Queene Elyſena and Galaor, might cauſe a further deferring of that long deſired day: Came and humbly requeſted King Perion, that he would ſend for them, whereto he preſently yeelded. Whereupon Bruneo made firſt tender of his ſeruice, ſaying. Sir, I humbly intreate you, that none other then my brother and I may haue this charge, for otherwiſe you ſhall doe vs wrong. Well then anſwered the King, ſmyling to himſelfe, if I ſhould graunt your owne requeſt: I am perſwaded, you would more gladly keepe company with Melicia, then vndertake ſo long a iourney from her. In good faith Sir, replied Bruneo. to be alwayes neere her, is the only happineſſe I can deſire: notwithſtanding, I am willing to goe for the Queene, and Galaor only in my earneſt affection to doe them ſeruice. By my faith, ſaid Angriote, you muſt not performe this voyage, without my companie. Why then (quoth the King) goe you all three, and heauen grant, that you may finde my ſonne in better eſtate, then when I left him. Sir, anſwered Yſanio, ſome few daies ſince, certaine Merchants comming from Gaule, gaue mee credible aſſurance that hee was well recouered, becauſe they had ſeene him; complayning only that his countenance was (as yet) pale and Wan, by reaſon of his long ſickneſſe.
                  Theſe newes were highly pleaſing to the King, and all the companie, in regard whereof, Bruneo, and his two other friends, tooke ſhipping the next morning, and ſayled with ſuch proſperous Windes: that in few dayes after, they landed where the Queene then lay, of whom they were moſt gratiouſly entertayned, eſpecially by Galaor, becauſe hee longed to heare tidings from his brother and other friends. And as hee embraced them, with the tears trickling downe his cheekes, hee ſaid. By my faith, my good Lords, misfortune hath ſo long kept mee companie, that, conſidering what iniurie ſhe hath done mee (in with-holding me all this while from you and the exerciſe of Armes) it hath beene (well neere) a Thouſand deaths to me. My Lord quoth Bruneo, wee haue brought you ſuch newes, as will make a ſufficient ſatisfaction, for all the anguiſh you haue endured.
                  So, hee declared before the Queene, the encounter, and battailes betweene the Kings, Perion, and Liſuart, what great dangers

and perils they were in, by the ſudden onſet of King Arauigne and Archalaus: And laſt of all, the league of loue and amity, combined on both ſides, and the ſeuerall marriages conſulted and agreed vpon. hereat Galaor was ſomewhat amazed, hauing neuer heard any thing of ſuch attempts, and anſwered Bruneo thus. Is it poſſible, that my noble Lord king Liſuart ſhould be in ſuch extreamity, and I not neare him? Vpon my ſoule, I muſt now confeſſe, that Fortune loued mee much better then euer ſhe did: For had I not beene ſicke, whatſoeuer dutie I owe to the King my father, I ſhould haue made no ſpare of my life, to ſuccor the other. Yet it had fallen out worſe for mee, if in the time of my ſickneſſe, I had receiued any certaine tydings of this matter: vndoubtedly it had beene my death, to faile him in a neceſſity ſo vrgent. It is much better ſaide Bruneo, that all things are paſt in ſo good order.
                  Then taking him by the hand, thus he proceeded. I receiued charge from my Lord Amadis, to doe his re-commendations to you, and to deſire you, that you would cheere vp and recreate your ſpirits, in the beſt manner you can deuiſe: for he is minded (if you thinke it ſo conuenient) to haue you ioyned in marriage with Queen Briolania, ſo ſoone as you ſhall be ariued there. And wee were expreſſely ſent from king Perion, to conduct the Queen to the Encloſed Iſle, where he attendeth her comming, with a goodly traine of Knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen. Son (quoth ſhe to Galaor) we will part hence this next enſuing weeke, in the meane while, take order for ſhipping, and all things needefull for our voyage. And therefore preſently ſent for ſailers, who hauing vnderſtood his pleaſure, made immediate prouiſion, of the very beſt Ship the King had, and went aboarde the ſixt day following.
                  Not farre had they ſailed from the coaſt of Gaule, but they deſcried a veſſell on the Sea, well fitted with the winde, and making nimble ſpeed, the Pilot or Maſter ſtriking ſaile, ſo ſoone as hee eſpyed the Queenes ſhippe. Whereupon, the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, thinking them to be Courſaires, or Pirates▪ forthwith armed themſelues, and to vnderſtand the truth, ſent one of their Squires in a Squiffe towardes them, to demand of whence they were, and whither they intended. The Squire drawing neare vnto them, called out aloude vnto them, ſaying. Hoe, aboard there, they in the Shippe here not farre off from you, in kindneſſe ſent to knowe what you are, and whither you are bound? My friend, quoth a knight ſtanding on the Decke, there is a Ladie of honour in this veſſell, whoſe voyage tendeth to the Encloſed Iſle. Beleeue mee Sir, replied the Squire, then ſhee hath met with company, if ſhe be ſo pleaſed: for they that ſent mee to you, are ſayling thither, and you may ſafely come aboard them. Which words being ended, he returned to them he came from.
                  In the meane ſpace, that knight that was aboue, went downe to the Ladie, and acquainted her with the Squires meſſage: by meanes wherof, ſhee ſent one in a Frigate preſently away, to vnderſtand the truth, and whether (vpon the Squires words) ſhee might ſafely come to them, or no: and ſo went nearer to the Queenes Ship, where Angriote being firſt of all ſeene, the other Knight ſpake thus vnto him. Sir,

a Squire of yours, (not long ſince) came to vs, to know what wee were and whither our trauaile intended. Wee gaue him anſwere, that wee were bound directly for the Encloſed Iſle, and thither (hee ſaid) was likewiſe your intention, now Sir, becauſe wee haue in charge, a Princeſte of great eſteeme; we pray you giue vs ſome aſſurance of your companie. Knight, anſwered Angriote, if you pleaſe to come aboord of vs, the Ladie you talke of ſhall finde a Queene heere, who wil gladly welcome her into her company, and giue her as gracious entertainment, as ſhee can deſire to haue. Sir, ſaid the knight, I heartily thanke you for her, and this I dare aſſure you, that hauing heard her cauſe, and the reaſon of her trauailing thus on the Sea, you will ſo much compaſſionate her caſe, as not to deny her your helpe if ſhee require it of you.
                  So taking leaue, hee returned to the other veſſell, which preſently came and ioyned with the Queens. Then came vp a Ladie in a garment of black cloath, ſhewing (both ſhe and all her companie) very ſad and diſconſolate lookes, whereat Angriote (who well obſerued them) was much abaſhed, reputing her by her countenance, to bee a Lady of good diſcent and reputation. And courteouſly ſaluting her, demanded, if ſhee pleaſed to aſcend, and viſit the Queene. Sir Knight, quoth ſhee, I will doe what ſhall pleaſe you▪ neuertheleſſe, I pray you name her to me, and them that are in her companie, Madam, ſaid Angriote, ſhe is the Queene of Gaule, my Lord Galaor her ſonne, is with her, and three other knights of the Encloſed Iſle, whither we are ſayling. Then will I attend vpon her and you thither, replied the Lady.
                  So Angriote, ſupporting her by the hand, brought her into the Queenes Cabin, and ſhee hauing vnderſtood all that you haue heard already, welcommed her moſt gratiouſly▪ but the Lady

                  Madam, quoth ſhee, though now I am left quite naked, of all fortunes bleſſings and fauours, hauing no other comfort or repoſe, but only the recytall of my misfortunes: yet you may beleeue mee, that I was (not long time ſince) a

For, very ſoone after the ſolemnitie, the Duke, my new ſonne in Law, beeing yong, and ambitious of rule: conſpired the death of my husband, and of my two other children, the eldeſt of them hauing not (as then) attained to the age of fourteene yeares. According to his proiect, ſo did he performe it vpon my Lord, & appointing a day, pretending an honeſt viſitation of vs, accompanied with a great number of his people, which (as hee ſaid) were brought with him for our greater honour: the King my husband no way misdoubting the premeditated

                  They called to remēbrance, one nan ed Amadis de Gaule, who is ſaid, to be the refuge and ſupport of all afflicted Ladies, neuer denying them his aſſiſtance. Whereupon, I haue attempted this long voyage, to finde him at the Encloſed Iſle, where hee is affirmed certainely to be, with a great number of other good Knights, his companions in Armes. When the wrong done me by this wicked ſonne in lawe, ſhall be knowne to that noble Lord and his other friends, & how extreamly hee maintaines the ſiege againſt mine owne naturall ſonnes: I hope hee and they will take compaſſion on me, and giue mee ſuch ſuccour, as by meanes thereof, I ſhall expell the enemy out of my countrie, for my ſubiects attend nothing elſe, but to vndertake Armes againſt him, they want but only a comamnder to leade them.
                  Greatly was the Queen mooued to pittie, hearing the misfortunes which beſell the Queene of Dacia: and the three Knights were ſo nearly touched, that they inſtantly reſolued to giue her helpe, and the Queene thus replied. Siſter, and faire friend, your ſorrow doth or a little grieue me; neuertheleſſe, I conſider Fortune as ſhe is, ſeldom ſparing either ſtrong or feeble, king or ſubiect. So that they which taſte of her beſt fauours, ought moſt to

                  Madame, anſwered the Queen of Dacia, I remember, that certaine Knights (not long ſince) trauayling through our countrie, tolde the late king my husband, that Amadis had ſuccoured Oriana, daughter to King Liſuart, who was conſtrainedly ſent to the Emperour of Rome. But Amadis reſcued her from the Romaines, and conuayed her to the Encloſed Iſle (euen in deſpight of their vttermoſt mallice) where yet ſhee abideth well accompanied: which giues me hope, that ſeeing ſhee hath tried the rigour of misfortune, ſhe will like wiſe take pitty on my iniuries, ſo that (by her meanes) I may finde mercy according to my expectation. By my faith Madame, ſaid Angriote, if the Queene bee ſo pleaſed, you ſhall paſſe hence no further: for I am readie to goe with you, and will make no ſpare of my perion, in your ſeruice. The like anſwered Bruneo
                     
and Branfill, moſt humbly entreating the Queene, to graunt them leaue: conſidering, ſhee was now come ſo neare to the Encloſed Iſle, as ſhee might ſoone be there, without any hindrance, and ſo much they importuned her, that at length ſhee condiſcended.
                  Hereupon, they entred into the Queene of Daciaes Ship, and taking farewell of the reſt, commanded the Mariners to ho
                        •••
                      ſailes, and away. The Queene of Gaule and Galaor, they purſued their porpoſe to the Encloſed Iſle, where (ſoone after) they landed, and the Knights beeing aduertiſed thereof, went forth to entertaine them. When King Perion ſawe Galaor in ſo good diſpoſition, the graue olde man was ſo wonderfully ioyfull, that (ſmiling) hee ſaid to him. In good ſadneſſe ſonne, ſeeing now we are in amity with King Liſuart. I will ſtand in leſſe doubt of you hence forwarde, then heretofore I haue done. My Lord (quoth he) I was neuer ſo ioyfull in all my life, as when newes were brought me, of your leauging with him, and long I wiſh that this peace may continue. There ſhall bee no fault in mee anſwered the King.
                  Looking then aſide, he ſaw Oriana and her traine, comming foorth of the Parke, to meete the Queene, to whom the King ſaide. You ſee Madame, wee haue no want of good cōpany here. No beleeue me, my Lord ſaid ſhe, & now I need not maruaile any more, that I heard no newes from you in ſo long a time, hauing worke enough to do, to gouerne theſe Ladies. Amadis and the Emperour led her by either arme, when Oriana came and did her humble reuerence, as the Queen alſo did the like to her. But Galaor, who was none of the hindemoſt, beholding the Queene Briolania: left all the reſt, and went to her, & kiſſing her, ſhe bluſhed ſo ſweetly, that Amadis perceiuing it, ſaid. Madame, I hope here after (hauing ſo good a Knight to be your ſeruant) you will diuide a little of that daintie colour, betweene your ſelfe and him, for hee hath great neede of it, as you may perceiue, and therefore to your gracious mercy I commend him.
                  
                     Galaor, who had not ſeene her, ſince his parting from Sobradiſa, when hee brought Floreſtan thither, but only one other time, being as then very young, when ſhee came into Great Brittaine to ſeeke Amadis: found her now ſo faire, and growen great with infinite rare perfections, that his former loue to her renewed ſo ſtrongly, that hee, who neuer ſought after a woman, to marie her, reſolued now to haue none other then ſhee, and ſhee with the ſelfe ſame purpoſe to h

And ſo it came to paſſe, for ſoon after, they were married, and of them deſcended ſonnes bolde and hardie, which conquered by (their valour) many ſtrange countries: as you ſhall vnderſtand more at large in the fiſt booke, reading the actions of Eſplandian, and there, all their high enterpriſes, are amply diſcourſed.
                  But returning to our former buſineſſe, ſo ſoone as the Queene Eliſena, was entered the Parke: the Knights (according to the cuſtome ordayned by Oriana, on the day when Amadis brought her thither) departed: and this lawe laſted, vntill the marriages agreed vpon, were celebrated in the preſence of King Liſuart, as alſo of the Queene Briſena, whoſe comming thither was hourely expected. In the meane while, their vſual exerciſe was, ſome to hunting, others to hawking, according

as the time and ſeaſon ſerued. For the place was accomodated with all kind of Beaſts, Foules of the Riuer, and other ſuch like pleaſures, as it were moſt admirable to be hold. And in theſe varieties of delights we will leaue them, to tell you, what happened to Bruneo, Angriote, and Branfill, after their parting from the queene Eliſend.
                  
               
               
                  CHAP. XXVII.
                  
                     How Bruneo de bonne Mer, Branfill and Angriote, went on with the Queene of Dacia: and what aduentures happened to them.
                  
                  
                     AFter that the three knights were entred into the Shippe, belonging to the queen of Dacia, ſhee not knowing their names, began in this manner with them. Lords, ſeeing it hath pleaſed you to vndertake this trauaile for me, let me intreate you, to tell me what, and who you are, to the end, I may doe you ſuch honour as becomes mee. For you know, that I haue no more vnderſtanding of you, then as one that neuer ſaw you, vntill I came aboard the ſhippe, where I found you in companie of the queene. Madam, anſwered Angriote, our ſame is (as yet) ſo ſlenderly noyſed through the World, that to tell you our names, will giue you no greater knowledge of vs, then before: neuertheleſſe, becauſe your deſire is ſuch, I will preſently therein reſolue you. Theſe two my friendly companions, are brethren, the one named Branfill, the other Bruneo de bonne Mer, not long ſince affianced to the Princeſſe Melicia, ſiſter to Lord Amadis de Gaule, to whom you were trauailing. As for my ſelfe, I am called Angriote d'Eſtrauaus, who deſires to doe you any ſeruice.
                  Oh my faire ſtarres, quoth ſhee, what friendly conducts haue you beene to mee? Neuer could I wiſh for better tidings, becauſe I haue heard you much eſteemed, by ſuch as haue ſpoken of you to my late king and husband, and how helpefull you haue beene to Amadis, in behalfe of the Princeſſe Oriana: which encreaſeth my hope now better then euer, that I ſhall bee fully reuenged on the traytor, who hath ſo highly wronged mee. Madam, ſaid Angriote, wee will doe for you what wee can, without ſpare of any thing in our power. Humbly did the queene returne thankes both to him and the reſt, and from that time forwarde, ſhewed her ſelfe more ſprightly diſpoſed, then before ſhe had done. And within ſome ſhort while after, they diſcouered the coaſt of Dacia, where as they purpoſed, ſo they tooke landing.
                  Now did Angriote thinke it moſt conuenient, that the queene ſhould keepe ſtill aboord the ſhip, vntill they perceiued how the affayres proceeded, and that they (being guided by the two knights which attended on the queene) ſhould ride directly to the beſieged Citie, where gayning meanes of entrance, the two Princes might bee acquainted with their tidings. Hereupon, they committed her to heauens protection, and rode away

keeping the moſt couert paſſages they could, till darke night ouer-tooke them, & hoping to eſcape the watch, fell into the ambuſh of ten knights, fiue of which being ſlaine the other fiue fled to the Campe, to raiſe the Allarme.
                  In the interim time, Angriote and his conſorts ſtill rode on, euen vntill they came cloſe to the walles of the Citie: where the guides called to the Sentinell, and being well knowne to the Watch, a Poſterne was ſuddenly opened for them, whereat they entred, and quicklie were conducted to the two Princes lodgings, Sonnes to the murdered king. They vnderſtanding the occaſion of their ariuall, and that the queene their mother, was returned in health and proſperous ſucceſſe: firſt gaue thankes to heauen, and then welcommed them in ſuch good manner, as their preſent eſtate and diſtreſſe could affoord. Yet let me tell you, they came but to a very ſorry ſupper, for there was a great dearth of victualls in the Cittie, through the ſeuere beſieging of the enemie, & our knights were ſo hungrie (not hauing eaten any thing all that Day, that they needed no ſauce to whet on their apetite. Wherefore ſeeing no other redreſſe, and making a virtue of neceſſitie; they went to reſt.
                  All this while, the Duke and his Armie kept themſelues in forme of battaile, remaining quiet till the breake of Day: but then the other fiue knights of the watche, which had eſcaped from the reſt, brought ſuch dreadfull tidings, as they verily perſwaded themſelues, that ſome freſh ſuccour was comming to the Cittie. When it was faire day, each went to his charge, and the kings Sonnes, with the knights of the Encloſed Iſle, called a counſell of the principall Captaines and commanders: Wherein was concluded, that one part of their people, ſhould bee ready to iſſue foorth the night following, at the changing of the Watch, as well to make an eſſay of ſudden ſurpriſing the enemie: as alſo, to get foorth (during the Allarm) the yonger of the two Princes, with Bruneo and a guide only, for conducting them to the neereſt neighbouring towns, and villages, to 
                        ••
                     rge their reuolt from the faithleſſe Duke. Where-to they eaſily condeſcended, in regard of their vniuſt oppreſſions: as alſo, becauſe the queene was returned, and the knights which ſhe had brought with her.
                  Hereupon, about the dead of night, Angriote and Branfill the chiefe vndertakers of this enterpriſe) came to the place where they found their men ready to march. The night was extraordinary darke, with a mightie winde and extreame rayne, ſo colde; as ſeldome had beene felt the like: which gaue them great hope, to finde but ſmall reſiſtance at the Watch, as indeede it fell out to their expectation. For, ſo ſoone as each man had put a white croſſe vpon his breſt, to know one another in the horrid darkeneſſe: they went out ſecretly at a falſe Port, marching on faire and ſoftly, without the leaſt noyſe, and ſeazing on the Scouts, ſlew them, before the watch could vnderſtand any thing. For, the time did ſo 
                        〈◊〉
                      them, as ſome ſlept, others lay to ſhelter themſelues in the Trenches: ſo that they made a ſhrewd ſlaughter of them, before the Allarm could come to the campe. By which happy meanes, they of the Cittie, (following their good fortune) ran in vpon the reſt, whom they found in their Tents

and Cabanes, and of them alſo they made ſuch a maſſacre; as the clamour came to the Dukes eares, and he preſently mounted on horſe-backe, with ſuch few followers as he could get to him.
                  Now was the Allarme, re-enforced, and the noyſe of Drums and Trumpets ſo great, beſide the outcry of the Souldiers, the impetuous murmur of the windes and raine: as the very boldeſt ſpirit became much daunted, becauſe there was neither Tent nor Pauillion, but they were all ouerthrowne, & rampled in the mire. Notwithſtanding, the Duke compaſſed the meanes to rallire the more part of his horſemen, and with ſome ſmall number of his foot, marched directly againſt his enemies: who perceiuing their approach, and contenting themſelues with what they had done; made a ſofte retire towardes the Citie, becauſe their ſtrength did no way equall their enemies, who followed vppon them with a fierce charge. But Angriote and Branfill (beeing in the re

                      two Knights, armed at all points, who had beene ſent by the duke the day before, about ſome eſpeciall affaires. The firſt that diſcouered theſe Knights, was the guide, who ſhewing them to Bruneo, ſaid. Sir Knight, for Gods ſake let vs turne backe againe: ſee you not two of our moſt eſpeciall enemies making towardes vs. Art thou affraid? anſwered Bruneo, bee carefull only of thy Maſter, and for the

                        ••
                     , and giuing the ſpurre to his noiſe, hee cryed out aloude to the two Knights. Traytours, theeues, ſupporters to the bad cauſe of the 
                        〈◊〉
                      Duke in the worlde: you are but dead, except you defend your ſelues the better.
                  By this cry, the other well knew, that (perforce) they muſt prepare for fight: wherefore, without returning any anſwere, they ran both at Bruneo. The one croſſed and broke his Lance, and the other failed in the attainte: but ſo did not Bruneo, for his Lance entring betweene his thighes and the Saddle, threwe the Knight to the ground with ſo violent a fall, that there hee lay more then halfe entranced. His other companion, hoping to reuenge his cauſe, drawing forth his ſword, returned vpon Bruneo, and gaue him ſuch a blow, as cle
                        •
                     t his Shield in the midſt. But hee caried not this comfort farre, for Bruneo ioyned with him ſuddenly, and reached

him ſuch a mighty ſtroake on the Helmet, as made him ſit ſtaggerring on his horſe: by which aduantage, catching faſt holde on his Gorget, hee drew him ſo ſtrongly to him, that downe hee fell to the ground amazedly.
                  There lay the Knight ſhaking & quaking, while Bruneo (diuerſe times) couruetted his horſe ouer him, euen as if hee meant to tread him in peeces: as indeede hee had done, but that he cryed out to him for mercy. Ariſe then, ſaid Bruneo, and ſee if thy companion be dead, or no. The Knight beeing full of paine, roſe quakingly vp, and comming to the other, tooke off his Helmet, when receiuing ayre, hee began to breath. Lift him vp, ſaide Bruneo, into thine owne ſaddle, and ſit behinde to ſupporte him vppe: which the Knight accordingly did. Then looking about, hee ſawe that the young Prince & his guide were fled: but they returned againe vpon fight of the victory, and being come to him, hee ſaid to the Kings ſonne. My Lord, heere I preſent you two priſoners, aduiſe with your ſelfe, whether I ſhall pardon them, or put them to death before your face, for more terrour to the reſt, that followe the treacherous Duke their Maſter. Sir Knight, replyed the Prince, they ſhould not pay penance for this offence, I pray you ſend them backe to the Campe, where, if they will become ours, I will cauſe them to be as well reſpected, as lies in my power to doe.
                  This aduiſe was wel liked by Bruneo, and much did hee commend the wiſedome and good minde of the young Prince, wherfore, vpon receipt of their fidelity, they rode together to the Citie Aumenta, where they were no ſooner ariued, but the inhabitants knew both the guide, & their young Lord. Wherupon, in a very ſmall time, all the people aſſembled about him, to kiſſe his hand, and offred him the very vttermoſt of their power: whereof Bruneo being very ioyfull, ſpake vnto them in this manner.
                  worthy Citizens, the loue which you haue ſhewen to this young Prince, your true and lawfull Lord, bindeth him to you in endeared affection, ſo long as hee ſhall liue: and the truſt which he repoſeth in you, ſhould binde you to loue and honour him. You ſee hee is but young, and hath ſmall meanes to expell the enemy out of your limits, and that enemie (as you all well knowe) murdered by treaſon, your late good and royall King. Since when, vſurping on the kingdome, hee hath beſieged the chiefeſt Cittie, and keepeth his ſtrength (as yet) ſo near about it: that without your ayde, it is in danger of vtter ſpoyle and ruine, with all the noble Citizens and good Knights abyding therein. Wherefore, worthie Lords and Citizens, now that occaſion ſo louingly offers herſelfe, by returne of the Queene your royali Miſtreſſe, who hath brought with her three Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, whereof I am one: conclude among your ſelues to reuenge ſuch iniuries as you haue receiued by the traytor, and doe ſo much, that your legittimate Lords may be re-ſeated in their rights. And this I dare aſſure you, if you will follow me: that I ſhall haue the meanes, to ſurpriſe both him and his Army, yea, vtterly to ouerthrowe them; only by the helpe of my companions, who are alreadie within the Cittie, and they will not faile to iſſue foorth, ſo ſoone as I ſhall giue them the ſignall.
                  As thus hee continued on his Oration,

there ariued two peaſants, who came in great haſt from the camp to aduertiſe thē of this citie, for certaine: That the beſieged knights and Cittizens, had made a fallie forth (in the night) vpon the Watch, whom they had ſlaine, as alſo a great number more, before they could bee any way ſuccoured. Moreouer, that the Duke himſelfe was beaten downe from his horſe, taken, & led away priſoner into the Cittie, by two ſtrange knights, as the report went. Hereof, ſaid theſe fellows, there neede no doubt to be made, becauſe we were in the camp when the Allarm was giuen, where we were conſtrayned to abide, by reaſon of the turbulent night, which hindered vs from ſelling our victualls. But wee were neuer in ſuch a feare, and not without great reaſon: conſidering that the Souldiers were (and yet are) ſo mightily terrified, as they ranne away confuſedly, ſtriuing who ſhall get him-ſelfe firſt fartheſt off. So helpe mee God, ſaid Bruneo, theſe are happy newes. Now beſtirre your ſelues, my friends, let vs forth-with part hence, and purſue them in the rere, that wee may the ſooner ſend them packing.
                  At theſe words euery man cryed, to Armes: but Bruneo (vpon better aduice) deferred this haſt vntill the euening, to the end they might come vpon them vnprouided: in the meane while they went to receiue ſome ſuſtentation, that they might the better march away in the night. His ad
                        •
                     uice was geeerally allowed, and they all reſolued, to liue and die with him. Hereupon, the houre for their departing being come, they were all marſhalled in order, and each battalion, appointed, marching on in good order towards the Campe: and about break of day, they came neere it within a quarter of a league. Then Bruneo by fiering of a Beacon, gaue a ſignall to them of the Cittie, aduertiſing them thereby what hee intended. But the Dukes watch perceiuing it, preſently ſent intelligence to their Captaines, who doubting ſome immediat danger, and not forgetting the precedent night and great loſſe: cauſed their bagge, and baggage cloſely to bee truſſed vp, and rayſed their ſiedge ſo ſpeedily, as they were gone three leagues off, before any knowledg could be had of them, or where they were.
                  But, ſo ſoone as theſe newes came to Angriote and Bruneo, they and their people mounted on horſe-backe to follow them: finding them very conueniently, driuing all their luggage before them: then they beganne to skirmiſh each againſt other, and although the harquebuziers kept themſelues behind with the greater part of the Horſe: yet were they ſo ſharpely charged by them of the Cittie, that they fell from their ranckes, and ranne into great diſorder. By meanes wherof very many loſt their liues, a great number were taken priſoners, and more had receiued much greater damage, but that they rallied them-ſelues together againe, and kept in a faſt combination.
                  
                     Angriote well obſeruing this, and calling to minde, that the purſuite of a deſperat enemie, cauſeth (often times) the loſſe of a battaile already wonne: commanded retreate to bee ſounded, and the rather, beecauſe darke night approached. So, returning backe to the Cittie, each man betooke himſelfe to reſt till the next morning, concluding then, to goe viſit the Queene, who (as you haue already heard) remained ſtill aboard her Shippe, in expectation

of tydings from the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, and of her ſonnes. Accordingly, they came thither to her, finding her ſo oppreſſed with melancholy, as no woman poſſibly could be more. But when ſhe ſaw them in ſo good diſpoſition, vnderſtanding alſo the ſurpriſall of her enemie, and diſſipation (moſt ruinous) of his Campe: her ſoule became extraordinarily ioyfull, as triumphing in the very higheſt happineſſe the world could yeeld her. And the Princes, her ſonnes, with the three Knights, came neare vnto her, to kiſſe her hand: which ſhee would not ſuffer, but embraced them very graciouſly, declaring no meane thankfulneſſe for her happy fortune.
                  Afterwarde, they conuayed her into a rich Litter, purpoſely brought for her iourney, and ſo cō
                     ducted her to the Pallace in moſt royall manner: where ſhee was no ſooner alighted, but ſhe commanded the Duke to be brought before her, as (accordingly it was performed. And albeit ſhee had reſolued with her thoughts, not to execute any reuenge vpon him, but (euen in meere pittie) to forget and forgiue all: yet conſidering what ſhamefull wrongs ſhe had ſuffered, and the murder of the King her huſband ſo freſh in her ſoule; ſhee commanded him preſently to the 
                        •
                     ibbet. But the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle were not therewith contented, and therefore, in moſt gracious and modeſt manner, tolde her: that they neuer tooke any priſoner to mercy, to whom (after-warde) they vſed any moleſtation. Wherefore, they deſired her, to containe her purpoſe till their departure: and then, to doe what ſhee thought fitte, and as her Councell ſhould beſt aduiſe her, requiring alſo fauour for their departure.
                  Shee fearefull to offend ſuch honorable & high deſeruing friends, returned this anſwere. Nay my Lords, thinke not, but I will doe whatſoeuer you commande mee: yet notwithſtanding, you muſt needes grant me, to ſtay heere with mee eight or tenne daies more. In which time, I hope to compaſſe the Coronation of my ſonne, and then to ſend him along with you to Lord Amadis, if you will but honour me ſo much, as to bee his conuoy thither. Madame, quoth they, wee are all herewith heartily contented. Hereupon ſhe ſent preſently to one of the Maſters of the houſhold, giuing him charge, to ſee all things fitting in readineſſe, as were belonging to ſuch a ſolemnitie, and in him there wanted not any dilligence.
                  The day of triumph being come, the young King, accompanied with the Princes of his blood, the Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, & multitudes of noble Perſonages more: rode maieſtically to the Cathedrall Church, where they heard ſolemne and diuine ſeruice. Afterward, he was conducted to a goodly Theater moſt magnificently adorned, and there by ſound of Trumpets, and voyce of the Heralds, he was openly proclaimed King: he throwing much golde and ſiluer among the people, crying three ſeuerall times, Largeſſe, Largeſſe, Largeſſe, giuen by the moſt mighty and magnanimous Prince, Garinter, king of Dacia.
                  
                  As foure of the chiefeſt Dukes in the kingdome, conducted him to the place where the royall feaſt was prepared, the Trumpets and Clarions ſounded on all ſides: ſo that, for the ſpace of three whole daies

and nights together, the people ceaſed not, from making Bonfires, and other ſignes of ioyfull triumphing. As alſo the Nobility of the Court, had Maskes, Tourneies, Dances, and ſuch like paſtimes: which had continued much longer, if Angriote and his companions would haue ſtayed there. But they earneſtly importuned the Queene, to licence their departure, which (much againſt her minde) ſhe was enforced to grant, and before their embarquing, thus ſhe ſpake to thē. Noble Gentlemen, although it is impoſſible for me, in any dutie to requite what you haue done for mee, without any merite at all on mine owne behalfe: yet is ſo falles out at this ſeaſon, that (running into a farther debt) I am to ſolicite you with a ſecond requeſt, and wherein, I deſire you, not to deny mee. You know very well, that I neuer ſawe Lord Amadis de Gaule, for whoſe ſake you did partly (as I imagine) vndertake this long voyage, which hath fallen out moſt fortunate to mee, and to your endleſſe honour for euer. Now, I haue not any thing more deare in eſteeme, then the new created King my ſon, who (as I haue already tolde you) I deſire to ſend to the Encloſed Iſle, to liue among ſo many good knights as are there: vntill he come to yeares fit for knighthood, hoping that a nouell kind of breeding there, will highly aduantage him, and that then, Lord Amadis will deale ſo honourably with him, as to beſtow knighthood on him with his owne hand. Wherefore, once more I entreate you, to take him with you, and deliuer him to Lord Amadis, as a preſent from me.
                  Madame, anſwered Bruneo, I faithfully promiſe you, that (with all my heart) I will performe it; and further I dare aſſure, that hee will be very welcome thither. Take order then for his equipage, becauſe wee would aboard to morrow, the winde now ſitting ſo proſperouſly for vs. Heereupon, the Queene hauing fitted all things neceſſary for her ſonne: with a very honourable traine, conducted him to the Shippe, and there committing him to God, and the Knights louing care, away they ſayled, diſcouering (in fewe dayes) the coaſte of the Encloſed Iſle. But before they landed, they ſent to Amadis, to let him vnderſtand, that the king of Dacia was in their companie, beeing purpoſely ſent thither to him, and to remaine vnder his gouernement. Which cauſed Amadis immediately to take horſe, and accompanied with many of the knights, conducted him to the lodging of king Perion.

                     How King Liſuart, his Queene Briſena, and their Daughter Leonora, departed from Vindiliſore, to goe for the Encloſed Iſle according as it was concluded on, at their ſetting from Lubania.
                     
                  
                  
                     NOt long ſince, it was told you, that the ſame day as King Liſuart came to his Queene, hee acquainted her, with his promiſe made to Amadis, and ſome others beſide: entreating her likewiſe moſt earneſtly, to take order for all things fitting her owne preparation, and her daughter Leonora 
                     
                        •
                     whom hee had affianced, by his worde, to the Emperour, and that they might ſet away the next weeke following. In the meane while, he ſent to Galuanes and Mad
                           •
                        ſima, to come to beare him company in this vaoyage, as accordingly they did. Soone after, they ſet on forward, and at the end of eight dayes, came within leſſe then foure leagues of the Pallace of Apolidon. Whereof when king Perion and the reſt were aduertiſed, they mounted on horſe backe, with the Ladies and Gentlewomen, ryding not farre before they mette them. Many embracings paſt on either ſide, but Amadis and Galaor alighted, ſo ſoone as they came to King Liſuart, only to kiſſe his hand; which hee would not ſuffer, but embracing them in his armes, deſired themto mount themſelues againe.
                  King Perion, who came one of hindemoſt, gaue the ſpurre to his horſe, and gallopped to meete king Laſuart: who came in the like manner towards him, and they both embraced very louingly together. In the meane ſpace, Oriana went to the Queene her mother, and doing her very humble reuerence: ſhe entertayned her ſo graciouſly, as no woman liuing could doe more. As the Queene Eliſena, Briolanta, Sardamira, and all the other Ladies ſaluted each other: the Emperour Arqueſill came, and alighted from his horſe, to kiſſe, and welcome them. Then the knights of great Brittaine went among the Ladies, who held them in pleaſing and familiar diſcourſe, vntill they came to the Pallace of Apolidon, where King Liſuart, and Queene Briſena, were lodged. Quedragant conducted King Cildadan to his lodging; Amadis, King Arban and Gr
                           •
                        medan, Guillan Galaor and N
                           •
                        randell, and Agraies his vnckle Galuanes, all theſe were thus honourably attended.
                  Now was Eſplandian iuſt equall in age with the yong king of Dacia, and this very day grew in ſuch friendly acquaintance with him: as they made themſelues vowed companions together: neuer (thence forward) to ſunder companie. But more eſpecially, after they receiued the order of knight-hood, and during their voyage to Conſtantinople, where Eſplandian became amorous of the faire Leonerina, whoſe gracious companie hee enioyed, by the meanes of his companion Talanque, Sonne to Galaor, and Manely le Sage, Sonne to King Cildadan, whom they begot on the two Nieces to Vrganda the Vnknowen, in the time of their impriſonment: As our hiſtorie more amplie relateth

in the fift Booke, wherefore at this time we will ſpeake no more there-of, but returne to our firſt purpoſe.
                  After the ariuall of king Liſuart in this manner, the Lords, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, being walking together in the garden of Apolidon, viewing the rare and moſt artificiall pictures: they heard (without the pallace) a wonderfull noyſe and clamour of people, and therefore ſent immediatly to know the reaſon thereof. Newes came to them for certaine, that on the Sea there was a fire ſo dreadfull, as neuer had the like beene ſeene before, and it made directly towards the Port: where-upon, the knights ſent for their horſes, mounting on them preſently, and the Ladies vp into the higheſt Turrets, the better to behold this meruaile. All of them did viſiblie diſcerne on the Sea, a flaming Rock ſo impetiouſly driuen by the winds and waues, as if it were continually in danger of drowning. And that which moſt augmented their feare, was, a ſudden alteration of this fire, into the ſhape of a moſt horrible and hiddeous ſerpent, which in more then ſupernaturall manner, extended forth his wings ſo farre, as a very good Archer was not able to ſhoote.
                  If this gaue them iuſt cauſe of amazement, that which followed did no leſſe, for it came directly towards them, with his head ſo highly exalted, as the head or ſcuttle of a Shippe-maſt, deliuering ſuch thick black ſmoake out at his noſthrills, as made the ſight of it to be loſt many times together: then ſuddenly againe was it heard to hiſſe and make a noyſe, as neuer could the like diueliſh terror be talked of: the common people taking it to bee ſome diuine iudgement, and a puniſhment ſent from heauen, for a notorious affliction vpon them all, fled vp into the higheſt part of the Iſle: and the like did moſt part of the knights, though much againſt their mindes, becauſe their Horſes, affrighted at the horrid ſight of this monſter, beganne to ſnoare, and fling about, and foaming vpon the bits in their mouthes, ranne vp into the mountaines, their Maſters being vnable to ſtay them. Yet in the end, ſuch as preferred honour before loſſe of life, got themſelues diſmounted, returning back to the Sea ſhoare, to make reſiſtance againſt this monſter, if it ſhould preſume to come on land.
                  No ſooner were they returned thither but they ſaw the Serpent aduance his wings, as if hee meant to flie away: and inſtantly from vnderneath them launched foorth a ſmall Frigot, couered with cloath of Gold, hauing two dwarfes in it rowing with Oares, conducting a very beautifull Damoſell, and two Eſquires attending on her. Suddenly King Liſuart called to mind how terribly Vrganda affrighted him, when firſt ſhee came to him in the Cittie of Fenuſa, aſſuring them all that doubtleſſe this was ſhee and none other. Sir, anſwered Amadis I beganne to imagine as much, ſo ſoone as I diſcouered the Friggot: although (before) I knew not what to thinke, but was verily perſwaded, ſome Diuell was come to worke vs miſchiefe.
                  Scarſely had hee concluded theſe words, but Vrganda ſhewed her ſelfe to them all: whereupon, their former great feare, was conuerted into as exceeding ioy, and ſo much the rather, becauſe in her owne familiar ſhape ſhee came on Land, which ſeldome before ſhee vſed to doe. For at all other times, when

ſhe would bee ſeene in any ſuch aſſemblies: ſhee came in the likenes of an aged woman or Beldame, or as a childe, a beaſt, a bird, or any ſimilitude beſt pleaſing to hir ſelfe. Then King Liſuart & Amadis went on to welcome her, and ſo did the Emperour, whom ſhee had neuer ſeene before: Neuertheleſſe, ſhee ſhaped her courſe to him, before any of the other, and ſpoke to him in this manner.
                  Sir, neuer in all my life time haue I beene in any place, that was honoured with your royall preſence, till now: yet notwithſtanding, I know you ſo well, as I deſire to doe any gratefull ſeruice to you and your Empreſſe, as alwaies hath been my ſtudious inclination, and as your ſelues hereafter ſhall perceiue. For by my meanes, the firſt fruite proceeding from your generation, ſhall be preſerued from diuerſe dangers; wherefore I wiſh you to remember my words. And although my abyding is farre from the limittes of your Empire: yet can I (when pleaſeth mee) be with you in Rome, in leſſe ſpace then the compaſſe of a naturall day. Lady, ſaid the Emperour, farre be it from me, to refuſe your gracious kindeneſſe, much leſſe, to miſpriſe your happy remembrance: Aſſuring you, I holde this for the greateſt good that can happen vnto mee, and I hope that you will keepe promiſe with me. I will not faile anſwered Vrganda.
                  
                  Then looking about, and ſeeing Amadis neare her, kiſſing him, ſhe ſaid. Although (my Lord) you haue beene ſo highly fauoured by Fortune, as to teach the height of your affectionate deſires: yet giue not too much credite to her wanton ſmyles. For, although you ſeeme to bee now aboue all ſtormie tempeſts, beeing in the peacefull poſſeſſion of your long loued Oriana, whom you preferre before al things elſe whatſoeuer: yet let me tell yee, you will finde more ſerious buſineſſe hereafter to bee performed, then (as yet) you haue gone thorough. Becauſe blame will more nearely choake you, by loſſe of the reputation wherein you now are; then if you had neuer attained therto. But as I haue beene alwayes yours in your paſſed fortunes, ſo credit me. I will continue in them that are to come. Madame, quoth hee, conſidering the manifolde fauours I haue receiued from you, and what true ſignes of loue you haue alwaies ſhewen me: you may well perſwade your ſelf, that while any breath remaineth in this body, you haue intire power of commanding me, and that my deſires are apted to your obedience. Concerning ſuch trauailes, as are deſtined and ordained to me: you know my wonted patience to endure them, and my vndoubted hope in you, will enable mee with ſufficient ſtrength to withſtand all encombrances, beeing guided by your fauour and good counſell.
                  King Liſuart then came to her, ſaying. Madame, if you be ſo pleaſed, let vs goe on to the Pallace of Apolidon, where the Ladies doe attend your comming: for they are already aduertiſed of your ariuall, and there we may much better conferre together. With all my heart, quoth ſhee, and calling the two young Squires forth of the Frigate, placing the one on her right hand, and the other on her left, ſhe went on with the King and troupe: then calling Eſplandian to her, thus ſhee ſpake. I promiſe you (faire youth) I haue had better remembrance of you, then you can imagine: And

beholde I haue brought hither theſe two Gentlemen, to keepe company with you, becauſe you will ſtand in much need of their helpe, when you ſhall bee in the greateſt heate of all your buſineſſe. Wherefore, hence forwarde, I pray you to affect them, euen as deare as your ſefe.
                  Then, perceiuing the Ladies cō
                     ming to meet them, ſhee gaue ouer talking, to doe them reuerence: and as ſhee kiſſed each after other, comming to Oriana, ſhee ſpake out ſo loude as all might heare her. Beleeue me Madame, neuer was I better pleaſed, then being in ſuch cō
                     panie: for hardly can (elſewhere) be found ſuch ſtore of bright beauties, enriched with all rarietie of choyce perfections. Madame, anſwered Queene Briſena, no doubt but your words would be very true, if all here were ſuch as you ſpeake of. So taking her by the hand, ſhe conducted her into her chamber, where the Knights left them, that they might conuerſe more priuately together.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXIX.
                  
                     Of the conference which Amadis had with his Coſen Dragonis, in giuing him the kingdome of the Profound Iſle, and the Princeſſe Eſtoilleta to wife, whom he had loued a long time.
                  
                  
                     
                        DRagonis was not with Amadis, when he made partition of king Arauignes countries, and them belonging to the other priſoners: but followed a Damoſell, that guided him from the Monaſtarie of Lubania, to fight with Angriffort, Lord of the Deep Gulffe, who kept her father in priſon, to compell him ſurrender vp a Caſtle, belonging to him. And the Combate was wonderfull between them, for Angriffort was the moſt hardy and valiant Knight, then liuing in all that countrie. Notwithſtanding, Dragonis had the victory, and made him promiſe, to meete him at the Encloſed Iſle, within twentie daies next enſuing, & there to craue mercy of the Princeſſe Oriana.
                  
                  This Dragonis that we ſpeake of, was young, actiuely diſpoſed, and an excellent warriour: as hee well declared in the Iſle of Mongoza, when King Liſuart, came thither to aſſault Galuanes. For the more part of his confederates beeing defeated and fled: he kept a narrow paſſage, with very few men, and performed there ſuch deedes of Chiualrie, as hee became famous thereby all his life time after. Now, he could not come to Amadis ſo ſoone, but at his returne from the Deepe Gulffe, he went to Galuanes, and being both together: they receiued Letters from king Liſuart, whereby Galuanes was requeſted, to come & beare him company, according as formerly hee had made promiſe. By this meanes, Dragonis and he iourneyed thither together, and ſo ſoon as they were come to the Encloſed Iſle; Amadis remembring what good ſeruices his Colen Drogonis had done for him, in the late foughten battailes, & what wrong ſhould be offered him, if hee did not pertake in the like pleaſures and contentments, equall with his other

companions: being alone by them-ſelues together, thus hee ſpake to him.
                  Coſen, ſince ſuch time as you left vs, diuerſe marriages haue been cōcluded on, of the chiefeſt knights here preſent, and thoſe gracious Ladies, whom they haue ſo long time intirely affected. Moreouer, by generall aduice and conſent, the countries belonging to king Arauigne, Barſinan, and our other priſoners, haue beene diuided, and you therein forgotten, by reaſon of your abſence: Yet there is further conſideration had of you, as you ſhall preſently vnderſtand. I haue beene lately aduertiſed by a Squire, that ſince our parting for Lubania, the King of the Profounde Iſland (being grieuouſly wounded before) died on the Sea, ſome fewe dayes after, ſayling homeward from recouerie of his health. In which reſpect his kingdome ſhall become yours, and likewiſe you ſhall enioy in marriage the beautifull Eſtoilletta, by you long time beloued: meerely as due deſert, ſhe being a faire, wiſe, and vertuous Princeſſe, deſcended from Kings by eyther ſide, and as deerely eſteemed by Oriana, as any that I know, mee thinkes that (for your own contētment) no better ſatisfaction can be made you: Then to enioy her whom you loue, and eſteeme as choyſely as your ſelfe.
                  
                     Dragonis being not a little pleaſed, to heare Amadis ſpeake in this manner: knew not (at the firſt) what anſwere to make. For he was once purpoſed, to goe along with Brunco and Quedragant, in conqueſt of thoſe lands, which Amadis had diuided to them, and from thence, to ſeeke after ſtrange aduentures in Sardaignia: then to ioyne with king Floreſtan, and aſſiſtt him in his ſerious affaires. Notwithſtanding, conſidering how Amadis affected him, and what zealous care hee ſhewed on his behalfe; he promiſed to obey him. Whereupon, the next day following, hee and Eſtoilletta were affianced together, in preſence of all the Knights, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, to generall ioy on euery ſide, expecting the long lookt for day, when theſe marriages ſhould bee celebrated and accompliſhed. The ſame night, Amadis deſired of King Liſuart, the Dukedome of Briſtoy, for Guillan le Penſif: who gladly granted it, and the widdow to the deceaſed Duke alſo, for whoſe ſake he had ſo much ſuffered, as thereby he got the name of Penſiue.
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XXX.
                  
                     How the marriages of Amadis with Oriana, and the other Princes, and Ladies, Were ſolemnly Celebrated in the Encloſed Iſle: Where, the ſelfe ſame day, Oriana made proofe of the Arch of loyall Louers, and likewiſe of the Defended Chamber.
                  
                  
                     THe day being appoynted, when the amorous knights ſhould receiue from their Ladies, the fruite of their longing expectation, and that the mariages ſo long time delayed, were come to the pointe of celebration: the holy man Naſcian prepared himſelfe for that office, and after the ſolemnity in ſuch caſes vſed, a comming from Maſſe, Amadis ſpake thus to King Liſuart. My Lord, moſt humbly I begge one boone of you, which reaſonably you cannot deny me. Son and my beſt friend (quoth hee) I grant it with all my heart, what ſoeuer it bee. Then I entreate you ſir ſaid Amadis, command Madam Oriana your daughter, before wee ſit downe to dinner, to make proofe of the Arch of loyall Louers, as alſo of the Defended Chamber: Whereto ſhe would not (as yet) by any means liſten, by all entreaties made vnto her. Howbeit, I haue ſuch confidence in her loyaltie, and likewiſe in her excelling beautie: that ſhee will obtaine the honor of the place, whereinto (for more then a hundred yeares) neyther Lady, or Gentlewoman could bee ſo happy as to enter. And hereof I doe ſo much the rather aſſure my ſelfe, hauing often times ſeene the ſtatue of Grimaneſa, which is portrayed in hir chiefe and moſt eminent perfection neuertheleſſe, I am verily perſwaded, ſhee neuer was equall to your daughter. And therefore by her meanes, wee may all enter this day into Apolidons Chamber, and there finiſh the ſolemnitie of this feſtiuall.
                  Sonne anſwered King Liſuart, theſe are matters not appertaining to me, and it is to bee doubted, that ſuch an enterpriſe as this is, may induce ſome trouble or moleſtation, in ſo worthy an aſſembly as heere are met together. For we ſee many times, deſire to compaſſe a caſe of importance, may dimme both the eyes and vnderſtanding of the attempter, and that in ſuch ſort, as he may miſtake one thing for another, and ſo runne riot from all courſe of reaſon, whereby he ſeemed (at firſt) to make his entrance. My Lord, ſaid Amadis, I ſtill containe my former opinion, and that the ſucceſſe, will be anſwerable to my deſire: free from all harme or offence, but rather to the content of all this companie. Well, quoth the King, your will ſhall be fulfilled. So hee called Oriana, whom the kings Perion, and Cildadan (Bride-like) guyded by eyther hand, and thus hee ſpake to her. Daughter your husband hath requeſted a boone of mee, which I haue granted, although I greatly doubt, that very hardly (in my opinion) it will bee accompliſhed according to his hope; neuertheleſſe, you know that I haue alwayes kept my word, and therefore aduiſe your ſelfe, in doing that you ſhall bee enioyned.
                  
                     Oriana being not a little ioyfull to heare the King her father ſpeake ſo familliarly; performing very

great reuerence to him, thus replyed. My gracious Lord and father, commande what you pleaſe, I amready to obey you. Then daughter (quoth the King) before you ſit downe as a Bride at the table, you muſt eſſay the aduenture, of the Arch of loyall louers, and likewiſe that of the Defended Chamber; this is the boone I haue granted to Amadis. When theſe wordes wher heard by the other Ladies, a ſecret murmur ran ſuddenly among them; ſome for the loue they bare to Oriana, fearing leaſt ſhee ſhould not finiſh ſo high an enterpriſe, and to her honour: others more addicted to ſelfe conceit, made promiſe to them of going beyond her. Notwithſtanding, this ſtriuing had but a ſmall continuance, becauſe the King had a hand in the busineſſe, and he well knowing, that Olinda and Melicia, were deſirous to accompanie his daughter in her fortune; entreated them thereto very earneſtly.
                  But theire choyce friends, and new married husbands, were of a quite contrarie minde, and laboured to alter them from this humor, fearing their falling into danger, of looſing that, which they were not able to winne themſelues: and therefore, they deſired no ſuch triall, but were ſatisfied with enioying their long expectation. By the faith I beare to God, ſaid the King, you can no way miſlike their forwardneſſe, but rather ſhould highly allowe thereof: becauſe, for ought I can perceiue, they couet to make teſtimonie of their loyalty, by better meanes then you your ſelues are able to iudge of, and it is my minde, that they ſhall make their proofe, before my daughter Oriana do attempt it.
                  This pleaſed Amadis extraordinarily, knowing wel that they could not enter into the Defended Chamber, before her: and this disfauour to them, would be the higher augmentation of her honour. So Melicia and Olinda, went on towardes the Arch of loyall louers, vnder which they paſſed without any impeachment. Then the Brazen Statue began to ſound ſo melodiouſly, as euery one tooke great delight to heare it; but eſpecially Agraies and Bruneo aboue all the reſt. Going on further, the two ladies entred into the Garden, where they beheld the Statues of Apolidon and Grimaneſa. As they were buſily looking on them, they eſpied Orania almoſt vnder the Arch, looking behinde her, if Amadis followed her: and inſtantly, ſuch an amiable bluſh mounted vppe into her face, that with her owne naturall pale complexion, made her appeare moſt ſweetly beautifull.
                  No ſooner was ſhe iuſt vnder the vault of the Arch, but the Image ſoūded, much more harmonious & pleaſing, then euer before had been heard by any: caſting forth of his Trumpet, Gilliflowers, Pinkes, Daiſies, Colonbines, Pauuces, and a thouſand other kinde of flowers, the moſt oderiferous that euer were ſmelt. Then entring into the Garden, Melicia and Olinda called her, to ſhew her the figures of Apolidon and Grimaneſa: but ſhe was alreadie come to the Iaſper piller, where ſhee found all their names newly engrauen, but could not gheſſe how, or by what meanes. Herupon ſhe called them to ſee what ſhee had done, and thence they returned to the Images, which they found to be ſo ingeniouſly framed, as nothing wanted, but life it ſelfe, and ſpeech: eſpecially that of Grimaneſa, which ſeemed ſo exceeding

faire, as Oriana grew diſtruſtfull, of her entrance into the Defended Chamber.
                  
                  But this doubt had no long laſting, for ſhee going neare to the Venus made of Agate (only to take water of the fountaine) the Statua put forth her right hand, preſenting her the Apple, while, ſnatching away the moſt excellent pearle, hanging in her eare, ſhe made the like tender of it with the other hand. Now, albeit her two companions loued her very ſingularly, yet could they not preuaile ouer their owne paſſions: but (beholding this extraordinary fauour) ſome ſecret ſparks of enuy took fire againſt her: yet ſhe beeing willing to leaue nothing vnperfected, went to the Dedalus, in the midſt where-of (as I haue alreadie tolde you) was the Coloſſus of Braſſe, holding the Lanterne, where the diuine fire was kept by the Serpents, who looking on Oriana, beganne fawningly to moue their tailes, and bow downe their heads, in ſigne of humiliation.
                  By this meanes, without any other hinderance, ſhee paſſed on to the midſt of the Labirinth, & there beheld (at her owne pleaſure) the theft of Prometheas, which in the preſence of the three Ladies, vaniſhed away, and neuer was after-warde ſeene by any one, nor the Serpents neither. Wherefore the Ladies returned backe againe, to the place where the Knights, and other of the company attended for them. If now their amorous friends were in the maine height of contentment; iudge you faire Ladies, that haue made proofe of loues ſweeteſt fauours. For mine owne parte. I would gladly make you beleeue, that they all felt ſuch a heauen of happineſſe, as I could hertily wiſh to my ſelfe. Now liſten what followeth, and (perhaps) you ſhall heare matters, no leſſe pleaſing and delightfull.
                  The Ladies hauing ended theſe aduentures, ás you haue lately heard, Graſinda, beeing much offended, that ſhee had not followed on with them: concluded in her ſelfe, to approue that of the Defended Chamber, before any of the other, and thereupon, comming to Amadis, ſpake thus. My Lord, although my beauty cannot ſatisfie mine owne deſire: yet it is not ſo diſtruſtfull of it ſelfe, but it dare eſſay the aduenture of the ſtaires, or aſcending to the Defended Chamber. For if that be likewiſe ended, without ſome of my paines imploiment; all my life time (afterward) will be but irkeſome and tedious to mee. Therefore, let come what can or may, if I obtaine entrance, my minde will bee ſatisfied: but if I meete with repulſe, others haue had the like fortune before mee. Madame, anſwered Amadis, it appeares to me, that defect of beauty ſhould no way be your hinderance, much leſſe any want of good will: ſo that, if you like to beleeue mee, you may paſſe them before any other, who (by this meanes) may well be releeued by you, and ſpare their labor in attempting entrance.
                  
                     Graſinda imagining that Amadis ſpake as hee thought, deferred no further, but bleſſing herſelfe with the ſigne of the croſſe: went on directly to the firſt degree, which eaſily ſhee aſcended. But when ſhe came to that of Marble, ſhe was repulſed backe ſo rudely, that ſhee lay along vpon the ground, vnable to mooue either hand or foote. Which Quedragant beholding, ran to her, and lifted her vp gently in his armes: not without much pittying

her eſtate, albeit hee was well aſſured that his infirmitie would turne to nothing. Neuertheleſſe, ſuch was his deare affection to her, as hee moſt miſdoubted her owne danger by conceit.
                  
                     Agraies, who all this while ſtood talking with Olinda, ſpake thus vnto her. Faire beautie, though madam Graſinda hath had ſuch ill ſucceſſe: yet you may reuenge her wrong, & therefore neuer feare, but proceede on boldly. So, kiſſing her, he tooke her by the hand, and conducting her very neere to the ſteppe of copper: ſhe paſſed it as eaſily as Graſinda had done before her. But as the one was beaten backe, weening to get ouer the marble ſtaire, ſo the other found no better fortune, but was ſuddenly ſurpriſed by the treſſes of her hayre, and throwne to the ground very diſgracefully. By meanes whereof, Melicia aduanced her ſelfe, and, euen as if her heart and feete had flown together, ſhee paſſed ouer the two formoſt ſtaires: whereby they which obſerued it, were verily perſwaded, that this aduenture was only dedicated to her, and to none other.
                  Now beganne Oriana to grow very ſuſpitious, which laſted but a little while: for very ſoone after, ſhe was worſe repulſed then any of the former, and ſo ſhaken, that Bruneo, thinking her verely to be dead, began to greeue very extremely. Notwithſtanding, they that were well acquainted with the ſight of ſuch accidents, did nothing elſe but laugh: knowing for a certaine, that theſe feares were but ſignes of better aſſurance. There remayned now no more of the foure Ladies, to gaine (by proofe) the ſupremacy of beautie, for entrance into the Enchanted Chamber, but only Oriana: And ſhee ſtanding ſomewhat neere to Amadis, ſmiling, thus hee ſpoke to her. Madam, I know well enough that this honor is only due to you, and many times I haue aſſured your of it: therfore, purſue you fortunate promiſe, and ſtand in dread of no danger whatſoeuer.
                  At theſe words, he left the Princeſſe, and ſhe, proceeding unto the ſtayres, paſſed them all without any difficultie, but when ſhee drew neere to the doores entrance, ſhee ſeemed to feele an infinite number of armes and handes, which very ſtrongly and mainely reſiſted her. Neuertheleſſe, ſhee was not a iote diſcouraged, but defended her ſelfe vertuouſly turning euery way to any reſiſtance; and in meere deſpight of any impeachment, made free her paſſage, yet much out of breath. But when ſhee coulde no longer ſuſtaine her ſelfe, the hand which firſt fauoured Amadis (as you haue already heard in the beginning of the ſecond Booke) drew her pleaſantly in. Then an infinite of humaine voyces were heard, ſinging ſo loud as they were eaſilie vnderſtood. Bleſsed bee the ariuall of that only and excellent Lady, none the like ſince Grimaneſa, and yet goeing beyond her in all beauties, in regard whereof, ſhe is worthie of the moſt valiant Knight, that euer bare armes this hundred yeares, and more; with whom ſhe may here henceforward, li

                  Inſtantly the chamber doore flew open, and Oriana entred thereinto ſo highlie ſatisfied, as the commaund of the whole world could not more content her. Which when Yſanio, the Gouernour of the Iſle perceiued, hee plainely publiſhed before them all. This day is the conſummation of the Enchantments, which Apolidon left heere to perpetuate

his memorie: But ſeeing this Lady hath entered the Chambers all others may follow without any hindrance. Hereupon all the reſt, as well Knights, 
                        •
                     s Ladies and Gentle-women followed in after her, and there beheld all the ſingularities, which haue beene already related to you, in the beginning of this fourth Booke; about which they ſpent ſo long pleaſing time, as they quite forgot when they ſhould goe to dinner. But the maſter of the houſhould came to king Perion, and told him, that their meate was neere ſpoyling: Wherefore, he tooke Oriana by the hand, and led her into the great dining Hale, where a royall Feaſt was ready for them: there they ſate downe at each Table, according as the maſter of the Ceremonies called them by name, and were ſerued with the moſt exquiſite cheare, that could bee poſſibly deuiſed.
                  No ſooner were the tables with-drawne, but they fell to dauncing, and ſo ſpent out the day, till they couered for ſupper, which being ended, maſques, and mummeries came in, continuing ſo long among the Ladies: till the Queenes of great Brittaine and Gaule withdrew the new married couples. Amadis had prepared his lodging in the Defended Chamber, where he meant to reſt with his long loued Ortana: the like preparation was made for the Empreſſe, and the other brides. In the meane while, Amadis diſroabed himſelfe, to meete with her in louely embracings, whom hee had ſo long time deſired, and by infinite trauailes dearely deſerued. And being now alone by themſelues, no doubt but they made proofe, of the greateſt delights loue could affoord which feare had kept thē from long before. And if they were well pleaſed wee muſt needes thinke no leſſe of Brunco and Melicia, and alſo of the other amorous combatants, diſplaying now their colours in the face of Venus.

                     How Vrganda the vnknowne reuealed before them all, ſuch matters as ſhee long time had foretold before they happened. And how ſhee tooke her leaue of Amadis, as alſo of all the other companie, to returne whence ſhe came.
                  
                  
                     AFter that the triumphs and feaſtings were ouerpaſt, which continued for the ſpace of eight dayes together: Vrganda the Vnknowne (deſirous to returne home to her own dwelling) deſired the Knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen, to meet on the morrow following, in the great hall of the Pallace, to the end, that before hir departure) ſhee might imparte ſome matters to them, which as yet they neuer vnderſtood. And for the apter way, the next day following, after dinner was ended, and the tables taken away: in the middeſt of the whole aſſembly, ſhee called the two young Gentlemen or Squires which came with her in her Frigot and taking them by the hand directing her ſelfe to the company in generall, thus ſhe began.
                  Lords and faire Ladies, I know long time agoe, and without the aduiſe or helpe of any mortall man

that this meeting ſhould bee here in this place; after the paſſed conflicts, wherein ſo many famous and worthie men haue periſhed on either ſide. And, God is my witneſſe, if it, had lien in my power to helpe it, how gladly I would haue imployed my very vttermoſt paines. But things beeing ſo ordained, by the preſcience of him, to whom all creatures owe honour and obeyſance: it commeth to paſſe, that theſe occurrences haue happened according to his apointment.
                  And to let you vnderſtand, that I was not ignorant of thoſe things thus come to paſſe: I think you remember yet (very well) Madame Oriana, that being in the Citie of Fenuſa (you and I being bedfellowes together) you entreated mee, to reueale what fortunes were towardes you. And albeit I did earneſtly diſſwade you, to ceaſe from ſuch curious queſtioning: yet notwithſtanding, in the end (ouercome with oportunitie) I tolde you, that the Lyon of the Doubtfull Iſle, ſhould iſſue forth of his denne, and by his loude cries and roarings, affright his guardes, ſo that in (meere deſpite of them) hee ſhould ſeaze on your perſon, and thereby appeaſe his owne extreame hunger.
                  Now Madame let mee tell you, how this Prophecie hath taken his full effect, for if you heedfully obſerue it, Amadis your Lord & huſband (more ſtrong and inuincible then any Lyon) came forth of that Iſle, which by great reaſon might be tearmed doubtfull: and furiouſly aſſailed the Romaines that had you in guarde. Them hee foyled, took you into his owne power, and if (by you) he hath giuen any eaſe to his owne affections, you both doe beſt know it. As for you Lord Amadis, I tolde you alſo at the ſame time, how conſtrained you ſhould oppoſe your life, euen to the vtter-moſt danger that could be, and that the recompence you ſhould receiue, for all the li
                        •…
                     ll expence of your blood, would be but a long & large ſeperation, from her whom you ſo dearely affected. And euen ſo it came to paſſe, for after you had combated, and vanquiſhed the valiant Ardan Canile, where you fell into ſuch perill, as euery one doth well remember: the benefit came to King Liſuart, begetting you his hatred, and a tedious abſence from Madame Oriana.
                  
                  And you Sir (quoth ſhe to King Liſuart) haue not forgot the Letter which I wrote vnto you, the ſame day as you found young Eſplandian, in the Enchanted Forreſt, hunting with his Lioneſſe, wherby I gaue you to vnderſtand (if yet you remember it) the ſtrange maner of his nouriſhing, hauing ſuckt three Nurſes, quite contrarie one to another: a Lioneſſe, an Ewe, and a Woman. Moreouer, that hee ſhould bee the cauſe of planting loue and peace betweene you and Amadis, after that (by his meanes) you eſcaped the very greateſt danger, that euer befell you, ſince you receiued the order of knighthood. Whereof remayneth (as a ſufficient teſtimonie) the ſharpe aſſault giuen you by the King Arauigne, only through the procurement of Archalaus, and the ſuccour you receiued from Amadis, by the haſtie dilligence of the young gentleman, as alſo your inſtant alliance one with another. Now may you eaſily perceiue, if heretofore I reuealed true matters to you, or no: wherefore, I will now proceed on further, and foretell other fortunes, yet remayning in the deſtynies of power.
                  
                     
Firſt, I will begin with you two, quoth ſhee to King Cildadan and Galaor. See you theſe two young Squires, Talanque and Manely? Aſſure your ſelues, that in them I haue recompenſed the ſeruices, which you haue receiued from mee, if I haue done you any heretofore: cauſing you to begette them on two ſuch Ladies, whom I doe affect uery ſingularly. And this I dare warrant, that if heauen bleſſe them with life: they will prooue to be Knights of great proweſſe, very bolde and actiue in Armes, and as fortunate as any that haue fore-gone them. Therefore you gentle Gentleman, receiue them as your kinde companions, louing them at they ſhall deſerue: for I dare aſſure you, that they will bee faithfull, making no ſpare of their perſons, to aſſiſt you in your greateſt perills, which Fortune prepared for you, before the day of your natiuitie: which partly to obuiat and preuent, I cauſed the great Serpent (which you ſawe) to bring mee hither, within whoſe wombe you ſhall receiue the order of knighthood, and there you ſhall be armed, and there is a gallant horſe carefuly kept for you.
                  Moreouer, if hereafter you will remember it, it will guide you to the firſt place, where the courage of your gentle heart, ſhall yeelde the firſt teſtimony of your magnanimity, trauerſing (without perill or danger) the deepes of the Sea, accompanied with many Knights of your blood. By it you ſhall beget a new name, and bee called in many places, the Knight of the Serpent, and vnder that title, you ſhall faile into diuerſe ſtrange countries, with much labour both of minde and bodie, for the loue of her, that can reade the ſeuen red letters on your left ſhoulder, which will witneſſe (by the liuely colour remayning in them) that your hart is then enflamed with extreame loue, Vntill ſuch time, as a flight of Rauens, breed on the Sea Marches, ſhall paſſe from the Eaſt partes, ouer the proude waters of the Sea, where the great Eagle will be brought into ſuch extreamitie, as he ſhall find no ſafety in his owne ayre. When the proude peregrine Faulcon (more faire and ſound of wing and feathers, then any other bird of prey) ſhall aſſemble many, as well of his owne kinde, as of others, to come and ſouccour the Eagle, and they fighting with the R
                        •…
                     s, in hot furie, ſhall well neere kill them all, by the power of their beakes and tallons, conſtrayning them (for their lateſt refuge) to enter the mercie of the waues, where a great number of them will be drowned.
                  Then the great Eagle, acknowledging the benefit receiued by the gentle peregrine; ſhall draw forth of his owne bodie, a great many of his entrailes; & liberally giue them to his tallons, that beſtowed ſuch fauor on him, that he may (at eaſe) aſſwage the extreme hunger, which had tormented him long time before, and beſide, he ſhall giue him the free enioying, of all the great Foreſts and mountains in his owne countrie. At the ſame time, the great Serpent ſhall drowne himſelf before the eyes of all preſent, in the very deepeſt of the Sea, giuing thereby to vndeſtand, that then it will bee more conuenient for you (quoth ſhe to Eſplandian) to dwell more ſafely on the land, then on the moouing waters. Now neceſſitie enforceth, that I muſt goe hence into other places, where partely I cannot excuſe my ſelfe: neuertheleſſe, I will not faile to be heere againe,

at ſuch time as you, and your companions ſhall bee able to vndergoe Knight-hood. For I am well aſſured, that at that time, for ſome occaſion which is now concealed from you: you will all meete heere againe, and many more with you, before whom I will diſcouer wonderfull things. In the meane while, I charge you all vpon your liues, that none of you be ſo bold, as to come neere the Serpent: for I dare aſſure you, whoſoeuer aduenters it, ſhall periſh without any remedy,
                  And for as much ſaid ſhee to Amadis, as you detaine in priſon that wicked wretch Archalaus, ſurnamed the enchaunter, who at all times hath practiſed to worke you miſchiefe, and will hereafter attempt the like behold, here are two Rings the one for you, and the other for Madam Oriana, the vertue of them is ſuch, as they that haue them, or weare them, none of his enchantments can hurt them, or any in their company, ſo being as he continueth in captiuity. And therfore let me aduiſe you, to haue him ſtraightly kept, and in a ſtrong Cage of Iron, where he may bee ſeene of all: to the end, that liuing in ſuch miſerie, hee may die a thouſand times a day. For death is much more cruell, in ſo prolonging a mans life, then when he quickly makes an end of him in a moment.
                  Madam, anſwered Amadis, I well perceiue, that you depriue mee of all hope, of euer ſatisfying the fauours that I haue receiued from you and which day by day you ſtill heape vpon me. Lord Amadis (quoth ſhe) you did ſo much for me, when, by your meanes, I receiued my friend from the Caſtle at the Cauſey where you gaue knight-hood to your brother Galaor, as I hold my ſelfe ſufficiently recompenced, for all that I haue done, or can do hereafter in your behalfe.
                  Hauing thus ſpoken ſhee tooke her leaue of the whole companie, and mounting vpon a Palfray, brought thither ready for her: ſhee rode to the port where the two Dwarfes awaited her comming. Thither did all the Knights conduct her, vntill ſhee entred into her Frigot, which ſuddenly was wrapt in ſo black a cloude: as they loſt the fight of her, and of the ſerpent alſo, which lay houering halfe a league off, and ſhewed not it ſelfe till three dayes after. But the darkeneſſe being vaniſhed away, they beheld it in the ſame place, where Vrganda left it at the firſt. So the Knights 
                        •…
                     urning to the Pallace of Apolidon, continued out their feaſting, which laſted yet eight dayes longer. In the meane while, the Emperour Arquiſil ſent to prepare the ſhipping, which his predeceſſour Patin, brought with his Armie to Vindilaſore, and they being come thither, his people were imparked and the next day following, for the earneſt deſire he had to be at Rome, there to bee lawfully crowned) hee went aboard, with his Empreſſe Floreſtan and the Queene Sardamira.
                  
                  The winde ſitting fairely for them the weighed Anchors, and hoyſed ſayles, ſo that (in ſhort while) they were a great way off from the coaſt of Brittaine, & croſſing the ſtraites of Gibraltare, entred into the Leuant Sea: where wee will leaue them ſayling, returning to King Liſuart and the reſt, in the Encloſed Iſle, the more part whereof prepared them-ſelues, for the kingdome of Arauigne. But others, more affecting their eaſe, made account of repayring home to their owne houſes, eſpecially King Liſuart. Neuertheleſſe, before hee diſlodged thence, knowing well, how

faithfull King Cildadan had been to him, ſo long as all his ſerious affaires endured: hee did the parte of a moſt magnanimous and bountifull Prince towardes him, and before all them of the Encloſed Iſle, remitted the tribute hee paide him, to the loſſe of many worthy knights hearts, that had formerly ſerued him, more by conſtraint, then any inclination of good will.
                  So taking leaue of them all, hee returned home to his country. And the ſame day, they remayned there with Amadis, as well for the purpoſed warre in Sanſuega, as elſe-where, held a Councell: wherein was decreed, that Don Quedragant, Bruneo de bonne Mer, Agraies, Angriote, d' Eſtrauaus, and Brian de Moniaſte, ſhould go together, with them that were left of the Scots, Iriſh, and Spaniſh, by whoſe helpe, the countries of Arauigne and Sanſuega, (beeing neighbours, and butting one vpon another) might be the ſooner conquered. And beecauſe the countrie of the Profound Iſle, confined on the kingdome of Sobradiſa: Galaor ſhould grant ſupply of vittailes and paſſage, to his Coſen Dragonis and his Armie, which conſiſted of Gaules and Bohemians, with the people that Galuanes could bring from the Iſle of Mongoza.
                  
                  Hereupon, ſuch as were named, and ſet downe for the warre, took ſhipping on the ſixt day following, and the reſt returned home to their countries: King Perion to Gaule, King Cildadan to his Queene, and Gaſtilles to Conſtantinople. But Amadis and Graſandor, kept them-ſelues at, the Encloſed Iſle, with Oriana, Melicia, Graſinda, Mabila, Eſplandian, and the King of Dacia, in expectation of newes from them, that were gone thence with ſo great a power.

                     How Amadis went away alone, to reuenge the knights loſſe, whom a Ladie had brought dead in a ſmall Barke; And of that which happened to him.
                  
                  
                     
                        AMadis and Graſandor, voide (as it appeared to them) of all trouble or offence, hauing them in their company, whom they moſt eſteemed: tooke no other care, but how to ſpend their time in all pleaſure and delight. But Fortune, vtter enemy to any mans eaſe and quiet, when ſhee likes to play her changing prankes: had prepared a new occaſion for them of ſorrow and ſadneſſe, as preſently you ſhall vnderſtand.
                  One day among other, when theſe two Knights were gone to hunt the Hart, as Amadis held his hound in a leaſh, for his beſt aduantage of the game: hee eſpied a farre off from the coaſte, a ſmall Barke on the Sea, yet making towardes land, & imagining it ſhould haue ſome ſtrange occaſion therin, hee deſcended downe the Rocke, to ſee what might enſue. But before he could goe low enough, the Barke was cloſe at the ſhoare, and a Ladie came foorth thereof, and one Mariner, who (with much labour) drew forth a dead Knight, yet wholly armed. Amadis made

a ſtay ſomewhat ſhort of them, to trie what would enſue of this ſad beginning, hiding himſelfe behind a 
                        •
                     uſh for his better ſhelter, and long he had not tarried there, but he ſaw the Mariner and the Ladie, lay the Knight along vpon the Sands, placing his ſhield vnder his head.
                  This cauſed Amadis to conceale 
                        •…
                     lſe no longer, but going towards them, the Lady preſentlie knew him: Whereupon, ſuddenly throwing her ſelfe at his feete, and fountaines of teares flowing from hi
                        •
                      eyes, ſhe ſpake thus. Alas Lord Amadis, take pittie on a poore woman, and for the honor of Knight-hood, giue her ſuccour: for I am ſhee, that firſt laid hand on you (becauſe the Queene your mother had no other helpe then my poore ſelfe) when you were borne into the World: moreouer, I can well tell you, that all the harmes I ſuffer at this preſent, hath happened to mee by the loue I haue alwaies carried to you. Amadis ſeeing her ſo woe, begon, and euen meerely drowned in teares, as it were, could not know her at the firſt ſight: but looking on her more aduiſedly, he
                        •
                      remembred her to be Darioletta, of whome wee haue ſpoken in the beginning of the firſt Booke, and tooke ſo great compaſſion on her, as rayſing her vp very graciouſly, he promiſed to aſſiſt her to his vttermoſt power. Alas Sir, anſwered Darioletta, you haue but one only meanes, whereby to relieue mee in this vrgent extremitie, and that is inſtantly to goe with mee whether I ſhall conduct you.
                  
                     Amadis pauſing hereon a while, ſuddenly replied, how Lady, I haue no armes to fight withall, but my Sword only, and this bugle about my neck, & this hound in my leaſh, I hope you will allow me ſome better fourniſhing then they are. As for Armes, replied Darioletta, deferre no further dallying but vn
                        •
                     aſe this dead Knight, and put them on: for if you ſtand on any trifling, it redounds not only to my death, but alſo ſuch another as you loue, as well (if not more deerely) then you doe me. Speaking theſe words, ſhe drowned her faire cheekes in teares, and held Amadis faſt about the legs not ſuffering him to ſtirre from her, whereby hee became ſo moued to pitty, that he yeelded to her requeſt. Foreſeeing very well, that if hee returned back to Oriana; hardly hee ſhould gaine leaue to goe along with the Lady, and as their neceſſity vrgently required.
                  Whereupon, arming himſelfe with the Armes of the dead knight, and taking vp his Shield, he entred into the barke. As they were puting off from the ſhoare, one of the huntſemen came, to whom Amadis called, ſaying friend, goe ſeeke Lord Graſandor, and tell him, that I am conſtrained (in meere pittie) to goe with this Lady, whom I met on the Sea-ſands but ere while, euen in ſuch mournefull manner as thou beholdeſt her. Pray him to pardon me, and to intreate as much for me of Oriana, not to be offended with my ſuddaine departure, but rather to allow thereof: becauſe I could no way excuſe it, but to my great reproach and diſhonour. For thy ſelfe, I pray thee giue buriall to that dead knights body, in recompence of his Armes which I haue taken from him. Scarcely had he ended theſe words, but a luſtie gale of winde filled the Sailes, and (in a moment) they were ſo farre off from Land, as Amadis could not heare the huntſmans anſwere. As they ſayled on, Amadis ſeeing the

Ladie to take no truce with her teares: earneſtly entreated her, to relate, whither ſhe intended to conduct him, and alſo the occaſion of her mourning: whereto gladly ſhe yeelded, beginning in this manner.
                  Vnderſtand Lord Amadis, that at ſuch time as the Queen your mother departed from Gaule, trauailing towardes the Encloſed Iſle, according as the King your father had ſent for her: ſhe ſent a Lackey to my huſband in little Brittaine, where hee was gouernour of your lands, willing him, that both he and I ſhould meete her at the Pallace of Apolidon, where the marriages of you & my Lords your brethren were to be ſolemniſed. My husband ioying not a little hereat, and my ſelfe much more: ſuddenly prouided a good Ship, wherein wee imbarqued our ſelues, with my ſonne, whom you ſawe dead on the ſands, and alſo my daughter, hoping to beſtowe her on Madame Melicia your ſiſter. But night comming on vs, the waues and windes were ſuddenly tempeſtuouſly mooued: ſo that by their extreame violence, the ſailes, rudder, and tacklings of our Shippe, were all ſplit in ſunder. Our Pilot alſo was ſo diſtracted in minde, as all knowledge of his Compaſſe or Quadrant vtterly forſook him, wherby it came to paſſe, that our Ship remayning at mercie of the waues and weather: we were driuen vpon the Red Iſland (vtterly vnknowne to any of vs) where the Giant Balan abydeth, of whom you haue heretofore heard, & there we landed.
                  At that very inſtant, we were encloſed, & ſeazed on by the Guards of the Port, and forcibly brought before the Giant: who preſently demanded of vs, if wee had euer a Knight in our companie. My husband made anſwere, that both hee and his ſonne had (long ſince) vndergone that order. It behooueth then, ſaide the Giant, that according to the cuſtome of this countrie, you fight with mee one after an other, and if you can holde out but an houre only, you and yours ſhall goe free: but otherwiſe, you muſt remaine my priſoners, and therfore make choyce of which you thinke fitteſt for you. And one thing I will acquaint you withall before hand, that performing your manhoode (as true Knights ought to doe) you ſhall finde ſo much the more loue & courteſie in me: but if (through faintneſſe of courage) you faile in any the leaſt point, whereto the honour of Chiualrie bindeth you; I will vſe yee like villaines and cowards, and lay you where neither Sunne or Moone can be ſeene, and ſo you ſhall remaine ten yeares together.
                  My husband hearing theſe threatnings, and obſeruing the high ſtature of the Giant; could warrant no aſſurance of himſelfe. Neuertheleſſe, knowing what it was to faile any way: forgetting all feare, hee replied. Baſely are they bred (quoth he) and ill is Armes beſtowed on them, that through dread of danger, ſhall refuſe to fight for their owne liberty. Nowitſtanding, what aſſurance ſhall we haue of your promiſe, if wee maintaine an houres fight againſt you, according as you haue propoſed. Nothing elſe, ſaid the Giant, but my worde onely, which neuer was, or euer ſhall bee broken, for any good or ill that can befall mee. For rather will I conſent, not onely to mine owne death, but likewiſe, to my ſonnes, and kinred, and ſeruants beſide, as alreadie I haue made them to ſwear and promiſe. Before God, anſwered

my husband, cauſe our horſes to bee reſtored vs, and the Armes belonging to my ſonne and mee; and then begin the combate when thou pleaſeſt.
                  The Giant commanded them to be deliuered. But my ſonne, too raſh and ill aduiſed, deſired of his father, that he might begin the firſt fight: which being granted him, he was ſo ill intreated by the Giant, that euen in the firſt encounter, he ouerthrew him ſo mainely, and his horſe vpon him, that both their neckes were broken in the fall. Whereat my husband beeing offended, & thinking to reuenge the loſſe of his ſonne: ran againſt Balan, and brake his Lance manfully on his Shield, yet the Giant ſtirred no more at the ſhock, then if his bodie had beene a huge and ſtrong Tower. But as my husband perfected his carrire, hee tooke him by the arme, and (in deſpight of all hee could doe to the contrarie) lifted him out of his ſaddle, and carried him into his Caſtle, without any more harme done to him, but ſhutting him vp in a chamber, and I and my daughter with him.
                  Pondering there on our great misfortune, hauing loſt the life of my ſonne; my husband, daughter, and my ſelfe impriſoned, and our ſeruants no way able now to ſted vs: I fell into ſad complaints, and ſpake ſo loude (as it ſeemed) that the Giant heard me. All good king Perion, ſaid I, if thou or any of thy ſonnes were heere, I am ſure our wrongs would bee quickly reuenged: but I knowe you are all too farre hence. When the Giant had heard my wordes, and the Kings name: hee demanded of me, what knowledge I had of him, and whether he was the father to one named Amadis de Gaule, or no? I anſwered him, hee was, and that you & your brethren knew mee for ſuch a one, as had dedicated her whole life to your ſeruice.
                  Muſing a while to himſelfe, at laſt hee tolde mee, hee was ſo deſirous to ſee you, that if I could cō
                     paſſe the meanes, of bringing you to him, and that you would fight with him for our libertie: he would allow this ſmall Barke, and this Mariner, becauſe hee would reuenge the death of his father Mandafabul, whom you ſlew cowardely (as hee ſaid) in the battaile betweene the Kings Cildadan and Liſuart, at ſuch time as you cald your ſelf, the Bright Obſcure. Moreouer, that you tooke him vnprouided, as he carried away the King of Great Brittaine priſoner in his Ship. And that you might haue the more occaſion of going with me, and by an vrgent motiue to commiſeration: hee permitted me, to beare the dead bodie of my ſonne along with me, according as you ſawe at our meeting. But firſt of all I demaunded of him, that if it were my good hap to finde you: what ſecurity you ſhould haue, of wrong or iniurie from any, but him-ſelfe only? My faith and worde alone (quoth he) which I will maintaine ſo long as breath is in my bodie, not only againſt him, but any other Knight whatſoeuer, that would come hither with me in this ſeruice.
                  Thus (Lord Amadis) perceiuing the offers he made me, and the extreamity I was in: I was ſo bolde to vndertake what you haue heard, truſting in the mercy of heauen, and your goodneſſe, which neuer was denied to any, that deſired your helpe. For I am verily perſwaded, that you will eaſily ouercome this Diuell, that maintaines ſo wicked a cuſtome in his countrie. Deare

friend anſwered, Amadis, I am very ſorry for the death of your ſon: what elſe remaineth to be done, I will die but you ſhall haue reaſon.
                  So they ſayled on three dayes & three nights, together, and on the fourth,, diſcouering a ſmall Iſland, in the midſt whereof ſtood a Caſtle ſomewhat farre off: which made him demand of the Mariner, if hee knew the name of it, and to whom it appertayned. To king Cildadan, quoth the Mariner, and it is commonly called, the Iſle of the Infants. Let vs goe a ſhoare there, ſaid Amadis, to refreſh our ſelus with water and victuals: for wee know not what neceſſitie wee may fall into hereafter. Hereupon, the Mariner ſtrooke in cloſe to the foote of a Rocke, from whence they beheld a Gentleman, deſcending, who coming neere to them, faluted Amadis demāding, of whence and what he was. I am (quoth he) a knight of the Encloſed Iſle, & from thence I came not long ſince, thereto expreſſely moued by this Lady, to haue ſome reaſon done her, if I can, for an iniurious wrong offered her by one abyding in an Iſland not farre from this as I am giuen to vnderſtand.
                  The Gentleman requeſted to know his name. Balan anſwered Amadis. Well Sir, quoth the other, and what courſe doe you meane to take therein? Fight with him, replied Amadis, and pluck downe his ouer-daring Pride, whereby he iniurieth many that neuer offended him. The Gentleman beganne to ſmile, and in a mocking manner nodding his head, ſaid. Sir Knight of the Encloſed Iſle, there is a great difference betweene ſaying and doing. I can eaſilie beleeue, that you came hither with ſuch animation, but I am wonderfully affraide, that before you returne backe (if you purpoſe to goe on any further) a great part of the heate, which I now ſee in you, will bee more calmely qualified. Therefore ſir, I woulde aduiſe yee, to turne ſome other way for, if the Lord of the Iſle, from whence you now came, who is (as I vnderſtand, and haue many times heard) Amadis de Gaule, and his two brethren, Don Galaor and Floreſtan, (accounted amongſt the very beſt Knights in the World this day liuing) had met together, and gone about ſuch a fond enterpriſe, as you haue now vndertaken: they were ſure to be much rather reprehended then allowed for wiſe and diſcreete men. And becauſe you are (in mine opinion) one of King Liſuarts knights, to whom my Maſter King Cildadan, is an intimate friend: I would perſwade you to beleeue me, otherwiſe, worſe will befall you, and you muſt needs prooue a murtherer of your ſelfe, being aduiſed, and will not auoid it.
                  I know not what may happen, anſwered Amadis, but I haue heard all my life hitherto, that it is an Article, proper and peculiar to them, that couet the ſupream place of honour and renowne, to attempt occaſions of moſt danger, and difficultie. Not that they intend to bee, ſo highly eſteemed: But to ſhunne diſcouraging in ſo braue an enterpriſe. And ſeeing I am now ſo forward on my iourney; death it ſelfe cannot alter mine intention: wherfore Sir, I entreate you in courteſie, to helpe vs with freſh water and victuals, for which we will be thankefull to you. With all my heart, replied the Gentleman, and more; I will beare you companie thither, to ſee the ſucceſſe of your fortune, and whether you ſhall ſpeede well or ill with the Giant.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XXXIII.
                  
                     How Amadis ſayled away from the Port of the Iſland of the Infanta, to purſue the purpoſe he had formerly intended.
                  
                  
                     THE Barque / belonging to Amadis, being furniſhed with freſh water and victuals: the Gentleman of the Iſle, ſnipt himſelfe with them, and ſet ſayle away. And as they were conuerſing together, the Gentleman (who indeed was a Knight of good fame) demanded of Amadis, if hee did euer know King Cildadan? Yes truely, quoth he, I haue oftentimes 
                        •
                     eene him, among many good Knights, and no long time ſince, in the contentions which King Liſuart and Amadis had together: Where he carried himſelfe ſo valiantly, as I neuer ſaw any Knight of more merit. By my faith ſir, replied the other, it is great pittie, that Fortune fauors no better his high deſeruing, but euermore turnes her back vpon him, yea, and ouer-rigorouſly: in making him (who is borne to great occaſions) tributorie to king Liſuart.
                  
                  Of that tribute, anſwered Amadis, he ſtands now diſcharged, for the King you talke of, hath freely forgiuen it him, for the noble deedes of Armes hee hath diſcerned in him, and for his many ſeruices done to him, during the time of his hotte employments. Wherefore, the taxation, which was ſuch a blemiſh to his renowne (not by any fault in himſelfe, but only vpon accident) is now cleerely acquitted. But know you this for truth? ſaid the Knight. Yes verily, quoth Amadis: And ſo related the whole buſineſſe to him, according as you haue heard it already. Then the knight lifting vp his eyes and hands to heauen, ſaid. Bleſſed be the name of God, who hath permitted my good King and Maſter, to enioy the right which is due vnto him. Sir Knight, ſaid Amadis, haue you at any time ſeene Balan. Yes, that I haue, anſwered he. I pray you replied Amadis, to certifie mee what you know concerning him. That will I very gladly, ſaid the knight, and (perhaps) in better manner then any man elſe you could light vpon.
                  Vnderſtand then ſir, that hee is Sonne to the fierce Giant Mandaffabull, the ſame man, that Amadis (when hee tearmed himſelfe the Bright Obſcure) ſlew, and on the very day, when the king my Maſter, and he of Great Brittaine, fought a hundred, againſt a hundred, wherein periſhed many other Giants, all neighbours to this countrie, and kinſemen to Balan, whom you now enquire for. By the death of his father, he became and yet remayneth Lord of the Red Iſland, where hee maketh his aboade at this inſtant, it being one of the moſt fertill Iſlands in all the Eaſterne Sea, and of the greateſt reuenues, by meanes of the frequent reſort of ſtrange Marchants, that land there at all times, of whom hee exacts an infinite tribute. Now ſir, you are to obſerue beſide, that if his father was valiant, and not meanely experienced in Armes: His ſonne exceedeth him in all things, only crueltie excepted. For, looke how much the one was a Tyrant, and moſt inhumane: the other is ſo much the more mild, peaceable and gracious, ſo that it

appeareth (almoſt) a miracle in nature, to ſee men iſſued of one & the ſame linage, to be ſo different in their qualities.
                  In this point, I muſt tell you a generall opinion, that this faire demeanour became hereditarie to him, only by vertue of his mother, who was one of the moſt modeſt, benigne and affable Ladies, then to be ſeene, farre differing herein from the other Gianteſſe, wife to Famongomad, and her owne ſiſter, ſhee beeing the moſt foule, deformed, ſluttiſh and vnhanſome creature, that euer was ſeen of her kind. Whereby may bee collected, that two ſuch contrarie complexions, ſeldome haue power to agree together, being deriued from ſuch diſcordant nature. Notwithſtanding, the reaſon hereof (in my poore opinion) may be thus rendred: that vertue moſt commonly is a companion with beauty and comely feature; but is a meer ſtranger to vgly deformity, and baſe diſpoſition.
                  Now Sir, I am further to tell you, that it is more then twenty yeares ſince I was appointed Gouernour of the Iſle where you found me: therefore I can ſpeake to you the more vnderſtandingly, as a man moſt frequent, in knowledge of any thing you can demand of me. For ſince the yongeſt years of the King my maiſter, I neuer went out of this Climate, by reaſon of the faithfull truſt repoſed in me, eſpecially in thoſe daies, when the rich golden Sunne ſhone not ſo aboundantly on him, as in later times it hath done. For by his proweſſe and other high deſeruings, he married the daughter to King Abies of Ireland, who was ſlaine by Amadis, when hee entitled himſelfe, by the name of the gentleman of the Sea, or the like kinde of appellation.
                  Beleeue mee Sir, ſaide Amadis, you haue done me a great pleaſure, ſo well to acquaint mee with the conditions of Balan, whom I could wiſh (for mine owne benefit) to be of another kinde of Character, then you haue now deſcribed him to me. For if hee had beene indued with ſuch plenty of vices, as you haue giuen him to mee in vertues: hee cannot expect (when time ſhall ſerue for our meeting) any hope in his owne ability of ſtrength. And let mee tell you, till this inſtant, I neuer ſtood in feare of his vtter-moſt power: albeit I cannot now well reſolue what to thinke of my ſelfe, in a caſe of ſuch ſtrange contrariety. Neuertheleſſe, come what can, more precious to mee is mine honour, then my life. And let mee further entreate you to tell mee, if hee be married, and whence he had his wife? In good faith (quoth the Knight) neuer man had better fortune in marriage, then he, enioying one of the moſt virtuous Ladies that can be: ſhe being daughter to Gandalack, Lord of the Rocke of Galtares, by whom he hath a ſonne, aged (as I imagine) about fifteen yeares.
                  Very ſorrie was Amadis when he vnderſtoode for a certaintie, what alliance was between Balan & Gandalack, whom he loued dearely, for the nouriſhing which his brother Galaor had of him, in the time of his infancie: and he could wel haue wiſhed, that this combate might haue been againſt ſome other perſon, although it ſhould fall out more doubtfull and dangerous to him. But if it were againſt his owne brother, hee could not now denie it, in regarde of his promiſe paſſed to Darioletta. And ſo long they held on diſcourſe, that darke night ouer-tooke them, yet they ſayled on merrily ſtill, till ſomewhat 
                        •
                     arely the

next morning; they diſcouered the Iſland with the red Tower, whereby the whole countrey had her name: becauſe in the midſt thereof was a goodly Caſtle builded, enuironed with great Towers, and ſuch walles as were of no meane maruell to be ſeen.
                  Then the Knight ſeeing Amadis take ſome delight in beholding thē, ſaid. Sir, this Caſtle which you ſee yonder, was not built as this day, no
                        •
                      more then an hundred ſince: but as you now ſee it, ſo doe ancient Hiſtories ſpeake of it, that he who firſt founded it was named Ioſeph, ſonne to that Ioſeph of Aramathia, who brought the Sangreal into Great Brittaine, at ſuch time as the whole land conſiſted of Paganes. But by his meanes, the moſt part of the people conuerted to the faith of Ieſus Chriſt: not without ſuffering many incurſions of hoſtile enemies, that dayly came in vpon them, & grieuouſly moleſted them from time to time.
                  To preuent this annoyance, this Tower was thus erected, in manner as you now beholde it, but after-wards (as all things haue their changes, with the alteration of times:) if fell into the hands of Giants, who tooke great paines to re-people the Iſle with worſhippers of Idols, & excluded all them that honoured the true God. Neuertheleſſe, our Lord prouided ſo wel for them, that (in deſpite of their enemies) they ſtill continued heere, though not in ſo great a number, or enioying ſuch libertie as formerly they had: yet partly by paying great taxations and tributes, and other of leſſe ability, by continuall ſeruitudes to the Giants, vntill ſuch time as Balan came to bee Lord thereof, who (as I haue alreadie tolde you) is debonnaire, vertuous and of Catholique religion, whereby hee is very naturally beloued of all his ſubiects.
                  Now, although the Knight declared all theſe good qualities, and many more in the Giant, to Amadis: yet all were but as fuell to fire, enflaming him ſo forwardly, that hee entreated him to goe before, and to let the Giant vnderſtand, that a Knight of the Encloſed Iſle was come thither with a Ladie, whoſe ſonne he had ſlaine and kept her husband, daughter & ſeruants priſoners. And if by combating with him, and vanquiſhing him, they might be deliuered, hee reque, ſted ſecurity againſt all men, but himſelfe; otherwiſe let him not aduenture to come neare the Port, becauſe the challenger held it as his refuge.
                  The Knight forthwith entred into a small Skiffe, leauing Amadis and his company at the hauen, in expectation of his returne. So ſoon as he came near the Giant, he knew him, as one whō he had many times ſeene, and demanded of him, whither hee went. Lord Balan, quoth hee, I came hither with a Knight, whom I left at the Porte, who tels mee, that he came embarqued from the Encloſed Iſle, and his comming is purpoſely to fight with you. At theſe wordes the Giant ſtarted, & began to imagine, that this was one of thoſe men, whom Darioletta had before ſpoken of, & ſuddenly ſaid to the Knight. Is there not a Ladie with him of ſome indifferent yeares. There is, anſwered the Knight. On my life, quoth hee, it is Amadis de Gaule, or one of his brethren, whoſe fame is ſo great throughout the world. I know not that replied the Knight, but I neuer beheld a Gentleman of more goodly forme, nor leſſe fearfull,

by his words, for if you ſend for him hither by me, and giue him warrant againſt all men, but your ſelfe, hee will quickly be heere, to end his enterpriſe. He ſhall be welcome, ſaid Balan, and you know my vſe and cuſtome to all men, aſſure him vpon mine honor, that hee ſhall haue no wrong or iniurie done him by any of mine: but if hee gaine the vpper hand of me, he ſhall enioy what he can demand of me any way.
                  At theſe words the Knight tooke his leaue of Balan, and entred into his boate againe, to goe find Amadis, to whom hee declared all that the Giant had ſaid. Whereupon, ſetting thence from the port, and comming to aſcend the Rock, they went on towards Balans Caſtle, where he ſate before the gate vnarmed, ſaluting Amadis and Darioletta, he demanded of her, if this Knight was one of them, whom ſhe had promiſed to bring with hir. But Amadis, taking the anſwer from her (as fearing to bee diſcouered) told him. That hee was not come thither to tell his name, but to let him feele the keen edge of his ſword if he did not make a liberal amends, for the wrongs which the Lady had receiued, and the reſt of her company. Knight, replyed the Giant (in a kinde of ſcornefull manner) I feele ſuch a feare inſtantly poſſeſſe mee, as conſtraines me to offer you ſuch a courteſie, which as yet I neuer did to any other: knowing, that you are deceiud by hir which brought you hither, ignorant who I am, and what I can doe. Therfore I am contented to ſuffer you ſeeke after aduentures in other ſtrange countries and not (for this time) make you liable to the cuſtome of this Countrie.
                  
                     Amadis being much diſpleaſed, to heare in what ſlender eſteeme the Giant held him; chollerickly returned this anſwere. Grant pitty or pardon to ſuch as thou haſt power ouer, and not to me, that haue thus farre aduentured by Sea, only to deale with thee: and that I will ſoundly let thee know, before the ſonne can circle this Rocke, if thou doeſt not conſent to aboliſh, and giue ouer the damnable cuſtome, which heere thou maintaineſt both againſt God and man, and which (in reaſon) thou oughteſt not to gaine-ſay. Moreouer, I would intreate thee (in kindneſſe) to doe it, for the good I wiſh to thy ſelfe, and in fauor of ſome of thy neereſt friends whoſe welfare, I as dearely account of, as mine owne. Let me therefore aduiſe thee, to yeelde this Lady redreſſe of her wrongs, before conſtraint compells it, and we proceed on in further trouble.
                  This requeſt, (quoth the Giant) exceedeth reaſon, and neuer ſhall it be granted by me: Beſide: let me tell thee, but that I am ſomewhat deſirous to approue, how your knights of the Encloſed Iſle, can maitaine the Armes they beare; I would not vouchſafe to put on any myſelfe. And becauſe thou art on foote, and lackeſt a Horſe to doe thee ſeruice: I will ſend thee one of the very beſt in my Stable, with Launce and Armour, if thou ſtandſt in neede. For I haue great ſtore of ſuch as I haue conquered, as well from ſome of thy companions, as others, who thought their manhood as good as thine. So help me God ſaid Amadis, thou dealeſt like a good and worthie Knight, the horſe I will not refuſe, neither the launce but as for any Armour or Shield. I will haue none other then thoſe (at this time) which belonged to the knight ſlain by thee on no occaſion, whoſe innocence giues mee both

ſtrength and courage, to reuenge the Wrongs done to him and the reſt.
                  He is dead and gone, anſwered the Giant. So leauing him, Darioletta and the knight, hee went into his Caſtle from whence ſoone after, came forth a ſquire, who preſented a uery goodly courſer, and a ſtrong Launce to Amadis: and inſtantly, vpon the toppe of the Redde Tower, a noyſe of Trumpets ſounded moſt cheerefully, which cauſed Amadis to demand the reaſon thereof, Sir Knight, ſaid the Squire, Balan my maſter is now ready to come forth, therfore ſtand vpon your guard, if you will be well aduiſed.
                  Scarcely had hee ended theſe words, but all they within the Caſtle, as well men as women, came vpon the walles, and battlements, to behold the iſſue of this combat: and preſently came forth Balan, mounted on the like courſer as hee had ſent to Amadis, armed with a moſt bright Armour, and bearing an huge ſhield beyond meaſure. As he approached neere to his enemie, who ſate readily prepared to encounter him, hee ſpake ſo loude as euery one might heare him. Before God, Knight of the Encloſed Iſle, thine ouer-weening hath too farre blinded thine vnderſtanding, and I am ſo much mooued thereat, that I cannot chuſe but pittie thee, for refuſing my kinde offer when I tendred it to thee. Pittie me? anſwered Amadis, I well may doe it on thee and thy ſoule, except thou ſpeedily repent: Otherwiſe, le
                        •…
                      employ the time in manly execution, and not in idle menacing words, as thou doeſt.
                  Claſping downe their Beauers, and couching their Launces, they ranne each againſt other with ſuch ſwiftneſſe, as if lightning had carried them. Amadis met Balan ſo ſtrongly, that hee pierced both his ſhield and coate of Male, directly vpon the ſtomacke bone, which was ſo painefull to him, that he fell downe on the ground, when as hee had charged Amadis, and ran his Launce ſo farre into the horſes head (the paine he felt much qualifying the vigour of the blow) that the horſe fell downe dead, and his Maſter vnder him. But he quickly recouered himſelfe, and drawing forth his Sword, marched towards Balan, who yet was ſo terrified with his fall as hee could hardly ſtand on his feete. Notwithſtanding feare of death, and ſhame to bee vanquiſhed, made him cheere vp his ſpirits, and ſtand vpon the maineſt manly defence of himſelfe. Then they beganne to hack and hew one another, that whoſoeuer had heard and not ſeene them: would rather haue thought the noyſe to bee hammers one an anuile, then ſwords on Armour.
                  As the Giant lifted vp his ſword with all his force, thinking to beate downe Amadis with the blow: his Shielde glaunced aſide, whereof Amadis taking aduantage, and ſeeing Balan ſo openly diſcouered wounded him in the right arme, juſt on the elbow ioynt, the griefe wherof made him almoſt ſenceleſſe, and retyring back two or three paces, reeled like a drunken man, When the knight of the Iſle of the In

                        anta perceiued plainly, that Amadis had the better of the fight, chiefely, that at the firſt encounter with the Launce, he had ouerthrowne him, whom he (before) reputed inuincible, and beheld ſo much blood iſſuing forth of his Arme, as ſet a crimſon die on the ground: hee could not preſume who or what he might be, but as diuers coniectures met

his thoughts, bleſſing himſelfe, with the ſigne of the Croſſe, he ſaid to the Lady. Where could you meet with ſuch a diuell as performeth things impoſſible for any mortall man to doe. Ah Sir Knight, quoth ſhe, if the world hade a few more ſuch men as he, the pride of wicked wretches would not be ſo inſolent, as it is in many places.
                  In this meane while, Amadis followed the Giant hot & fiercely, and hee ſo weakened more and more, by loſing the benefit of his right arme: that hee was compelled to take his ſword into his left hand, but his enemy gaue him ſuch a ſtroake (in the meane ſpace) on the toppe of his Helmet, as made the ſight or fore part turne directly behinde. Which fell out very ill for Balan, for being thus bereft of ſight, hee ſtroue extreamely to recouer it againe: but not without much paine and difficulty, thorough his right armes diſabling, from whence the blood ſtill ſtreamed aboundantly. Then Amadis hoping for a finall concluſion of his buſie trouble, lifted vppe his ſworde for another ſtroake: but the Giant had firſt re-ſeated his Helmet, and ſeeing the blowe comming, defended it with his Shield ſo well as hee could, and the ſword of Amadis entred ſo far into it, that it was impoſſible for him to get it out againe.
                  Now beganne they to hale and tugge one another ſo violently, that the thongs or leathers of their Armour brake in ſunder, and both the ſword and ſhield was wholly in the power of Amadis, which prooued farre more troubleſome to him then before; for it was ſo exceeding heauie, as hee could ſcarſely ſtirre it from the ground. By meanes wherof, the Giant had more eaſe to beſtirre himſelfe, charging Amadis at his owne pleaſure: but it was with his left hand onely, and much the better for Amadis, for if Balan could haue commanded his other arme, Amadis had died without all doubt hauing neither ſword nor ſhield, wherewith to defend himſelfe. But neceſſitie (the quicke conceiuing mother of inuention) enſtructed him ſuddenly with a new kinde of remedie, in manner following.
                  Hee had his owne Shield ſtill hanging behinde him in a Bauldrick, which did mightily hinder his ſtrength, in recouering his Sword out of Balans Shield: wherefore, hee rent it violently from his owne neck, and threwe mainly aſtainſt the ſhinnes of Balan, who felt the throw very painefully. Afterward, taking his Sworde (newly recouered by both his hands, from out of the Giants Shield, and by ſetting his right foot manfully on it) it plainely appeared to euery eye, that he won it not eaſily, becauſe (in the interim) Balan charged him ſeuerely, & grieuouſly wounded him in many places on his bodie. But hauing recouered the beſt part of his defence, his heart and courage became therby the more chearfull and forward, in following his enemie at all aduantages, to play ſtill vpon him, as occaſion ſerued, and therein he expreſſed all care and diligence. And indeed, the paine of the Giants ſtomacke, by the puſh of the Lance, with the ouer liberal expence of his blood, ſo extreamely encreaſed his paine and torment: that breath failed him, and in a ſwone he fell on the ground.
                  When they in the Caſtle beheld this, and verily ſuppoſing him to be dead; crying out with one voyce to Amadis: Ah traytour, in an ill houre haſt thou ſlaine the beſt Knight in the world. But notwithſtanding,

all their lamentations Amadis would not bee ſtayed, but ſtepping vpon the Giant; rent the Helmet from his Head, and perceiuing him to bee yet liuing, ſpake out loude enough to him, ſaying. Yeeld thy ſelfe Balan, if thou wilt not loſe thy head: neuertheleſſe, hee ſtirred neither hand nor foot for all theſe wordes. Then the Knight, who was Gouernour of the Infanta Iſland, fearing leaſt Amadis would vſe Balan as he threatned him: came neare vnto him, & demanded, whether the Giant were dead, or no. No, anſwered Amadis, neither doe I ſee any wound on him, whereby hee ſhould bee thus farre out of heart Let mee entreat you then Sir, ſaid the Knight, to deale no worſe with him then you haue done, vntill hee come to him-ſelfe againe, and then I dare promiſe you, that he will ſatisfie what-ſoeuer you can demand of him. Otherwiſe, beleeue it vndoubtedly, more harme will happen to you, then you can eaſily imagine: for the people within the Caſtle are already in Armes, and will be reuenged on you to their vttermoſt power. For them (anſwered Amadis) I make no reckoning at all: but for your ſake, and his neare alliance to Gandalack, I am the more willing to be perſwaded.
                  At theſe words, they ſaw Brauor, ſonne to Balan, come forth of the Caſtle, accompanied with thirty men well armed, whereupon, Amadis perceiuing in what danger he was: drew backe to the Rocke, wherein was a rift, after the forme of a caue o
                        •
                      denne, and there, one, or two men could well withſtand twenty and more, and the Grants Shield there ſerued as a rampier of defence. They of the Caſtle came meanely againſt him, hurling darts and huge ſtones at him, beeing no way able to offend him but before: but hee was ſo well ſheltered with the Giants Shield, as all their malice could not a iot touch or hurt him. Hereat, they grew ſo incenſed and enraged, that two of the boldeſt in all the troupe, ſtept forward to pluck him out of the cane perforce: but Amadis gaue the firſt of them ſo ſound a welcome, as hee neuer ſpak
                        •…
                     a worde after. This ſo terrified the other, and the reſt, that none durſt aduenture to come near him, or ſtep within his reach.
                  During this time of ſo ſharpe aſſayling, ſome of them belonging to the Caſtle, had carried Balan home into his bed, while the reſt oppreſſed Amadis very deſperately. Which was no little affliction to the Knight of the Infanta Iſland, vnder whoſe worde and warrant, hee had come thither: whereupon hee called Brauor, and thus hee ſpake to him. Before God Brauor, thou haſt vndertaken a buſines, little to thine honour. Doeſt thou not know, that thy father was alwaies a man honeſt and vertuous of his worde? And wilt thou degenerate, in breaking both his faith & promiſe. By me he gaue aſſurance to the Knight, and by ſolemne proteſtations, that hee ſhould not be offended by any, but himſelfe only. Neuertheleſſe, thou ſuffereſt him to bee wronged moſt vilely, although thy father bee yet liuing, and will hardly allowe this thy diſcurteous dealing. Beleeue me as thou liſt, for it thou ſtand in doubt of Balans death, take order, that the Knight may bee ſecurely kept this night, without any iniury or diſgrace done vnto him: And to morrow, thou ſhalt better ſee the diſpoſition of thy father, and gouerne thy ſelfe thereto accordingly, for I dare aſſure thee, that hee is in

no perill of life. True it is, that without my requeſt firſt propounded for him, and the Knights affection to Gandalacke thy grandfather (as him-ſelfe aſſured me) he had ſmitten off his head: therfore follow my counſell, and better will befall thee, then thou art aware of. I will doe ſo anſwered Brauor, if my mother ſhall allow of your aduiſe. Goe then ſaid the Knight, to know her minde, and in the meane while, let euery man withdraw himſelfe.
                  
                     Brauor commanded his people to depart, and keepe themſelues farre enough off from the Caue, leaſt they ſhould any way offend Amadis in the time of his going to the caſtle Where comming to his mother, he declared all that the knight had ſaid to him: and how for the loue of Gandalack hee that had vanquiſhed his father, refuſed to kill him. When ſhe heard what her ſonne had ſaide, ſhe preſently imagined that he was Galaor, whom ſhee affected as her own brother, becauſe they had been nurſed together at the Rock of Galtares. Whereupon ſhe wiſhed her Sonne to follow the Knights aduiſe for his father began much to mend. By this meanes Amadis remained in peace, yet ſtanding ſtill vpon his guard, leaſt hee ſhould againe bee aſlaulted by them of the Caſtle, who ſtood ſtill as his beſiedgers, but a great diſtance off from him.

                        e and lamentation: And how Balan and hee were made friends.
                  
                  
                     WHen Darioletta perceiued Amadis to be beſieged on all ſids, without any meanes of ayd or ſuccour: ſhe began to grieue and lament very earneſtly, and in her weeping vſed theſe words. Wretched and vnfortunate woman that I am, muſt the only beſt knight in the world loſe his life, and by mine occaſion. How dare I (hereafter) appeare in the preſence of the King his Father, the Queene, or any other of his friends, knowing what harm I haue procured to him? Miſerable woman, and much more miſerable then I am able to tearme my ſelfe. If I was once the meanes of ſauing his life, by inuenting that ſtrange kind of cradle, wherein hee was committed to the rude Seas mercy: how farre vnkinde and contrarie am I now to him, in cauſing the end of his dayes, when I moſt expected and hoped for helpe by him? Alas! how miſguided were my ſences from reaſon and vnderſtanding, at the time when I met him on the Sea ſhoare, and would not ſuffer him ſo much as turne back to the Caſtle of Apoliaon, to take his leaue of madam Oriana, and from whence hee might haue brought ſome other Knights with him, by whom (in this extreamity) he ſhould haue beene well ſupported? Who therfore deſerues iuſtly to be puniſhed, but only my ſelfe, hated and deſpiſed of all good luck, and performing the part of a light headed and indeſcreete Woman, truſting ouer much to mine owne raſh opinion.
                  All this while did Amadis beholde Dariolettaes ſadde complaynings, and how often times ſhee

heaued vp her hands to heauen, as requiring comfort onely from thence, yet could he not vnderſtand any one word ſhe ſpake, but enioyed this benefit of ſeeing her, by light of fire, made by them that watched him, and for their better wearing away the cloudie night, which alſo gaue him ſome feeling of her wofull condition, and ſo afflicted him in ſoule, as hee reſolued to die, or get out of the rocky caue, becauſe the nights obſcuritie woulde therein more auaile him, then day light could doe, or delaying time till the morning. Beſide, cōſidering the doubtfull iſſue of his preſent eſtate, it appeared plainlie to him, that hee could not eſcape thence, without eyther death, or taking: being ouer wearied with weight of his Armes, want of naturall reſt, and extreamitie of hunger, all of theſe beeing no meane enemies to any hopefull expectation. Only his beſt helpe in this neceſſity was, that he ſaw his guardes begin to nodde and ſleepe, and therefore ſo ſoftly as he could, and by little and little) hee offered to ſteale out of the Caue, hoping ſo to compaſſe his peace.
                  Well was this obſerued by the Knight of the Infanta Iſland, who conſidering what danger he might fall into, what ſpeeches had paſt betweene Brauor and the Gyants wife, all tending to his good and ſafetie: ranne preſently to him, and ſtayed him, euen againſt his will, as it were, ſaying Sir Knight, I pray you to befrend me ſo much, as but to heare me, before you aduenture any farther, whereat Amadis ſtood ſtill, to liſten what he would ſay, and the other declared to him, how hee had conditioned a truce with Brauor vpon hope of the Giants recouerie; who already appeared to be out of perill, and told him (beſide) what you haue formerly heard. Amadis hereat was very ioyfull, beleeuing him to be an honeſt and kinde man, that would bring him ſo good news and that no dread of death could cauſe him to inuent them, where-upon he thus anſwered. Courteous Knight, for this time, I both credit, and will follow your counſell, ſwearing to you by mine order of knight-hood, wherein already I haue ſpent ten yeares ſeruice: that I had much rather be hewn in peeces, then the Lady (for whom I haue contended with Balan) ſhould not be fully ſatisfied in her demaunde. Both you and ſhee, replied the Knight, ſhall haue all that you can deſire. For I know Balan to be ſuch a man, as makes more account of his worde, then hee doth of his life.
                  During this time, the Gyant lay on his bedde, not able to vtter a worde, but panted extraordinarily as one that endured a ſtrange kinde of perplexitie in his ſtomack; wherby his breath began greatly to faile him, and ſtill (one while after another) he ſhewed with his left hand, and poynted to the place where hee was moſt payned. Which his Chirurgeons perceiuing, (who durſt not as yet take off his garments, as fearing much to ſtirre him) they aduentured to obſerue the place whereto he ſigned, and found (by preſent apparance) that hee had great reaſon ſo to doe, for more then the palme of a hands breadth, round vpon the ſtomacke, the fleſh and bones were quaſhed, and meerly broken, as it were whereupon, they applyed immediatly ſo many oyles, vnguents, and other helpefull remedies: that, before breake of day, ſpeech came to him againe, and hee demanded, what was become

of the Knight and the Ladie.
                  Then the truth of all was tolde him, for none of them durſt tell a lie in his hearing: which made him to call for his ſonne Brauor, and all the reſt, that kept Amadis ſo ſharpely beſieged, and beeing come before him, he began in this manner to his ſonne. Infamous villaine, durſt thou preſume to falſifie my worde, in any thing that I had promiſed. Slaue, as thou art, what honour, or what aduantage could redound to thee, by ſo baſe a deed as thou haſt done? was it in thy power to recall my life, if death had pleaded poſſion of it? Or how canſt thou excuſe this treaſon, in purſuing that villanie which thou haſt ſo impudently begunne, againſt a worthy Knight, who had not entred vpon my land, but vnder the aſſurance of my worde? Didſt thou euer know hitherto, that for any thing hapning to me, I was any way falſe or iniurious in my promiſe? Haue I not euermore iuſtly kept my word, to my power, as valuing it farre aboue thee, or the deare eſteeme of mine owne life? By the faith I beare to God, but that nature ſomewhat ſpeakes for thee: thou ſhouldeſt inſtantly bee hanged ouer my Caſtle wall, as an example to all ſuch villaines as thou art, enemies to truth and vertue. Take him, take the wretch, binde him hand and foote, and ſo bear him to the Knight: then tell him from mee, thus I haue ſent the traytour, that not only abuſed him, but mee much more, and ſay, I entreate him, to take ſuch vengeance on him, for vs both, as hee hath worthily deſerued.
                  Not any man among them, durſt euer contradict what hee had cammanded: wherfore Brauor, was preſently ſeaſed on, ſtrictly bound, and ſo carried thence to Amadis. But his mother, fearing leaſt ſuch ſeuerity might be fall him, as Balan had vrged, and knowing alſo, what wrong▪ the Knight had receiued: departed ſecretly out of the chamber, and ranne after her ſonne. Neuertheleſſe, ſhe was not ſo ſwift of foot, but Brauor was preſented to Amadis before ſhee came, and in ſuch manner as the Giant had appointed. Whereof (notwithſtanding) Amadis made ſmall account, but pardoned him honourably, and vntied his bonds himſelfe, euen as the good Ladie came to him, whom ſhe preſently knew: for hee had taken off his Helmet becauſe it was ouer burdenous to him, but ſhee could not imagine, how he would deale with her ſonne Brauor, wherefore ſhee threw her ſelfe at his feet, and weeping, ſaid. Alas, Lord Amadis, doe you not know me? Now, albeit he very wel remembred her, and that ſhee was the ſiſter to Gandalack: yet (for a while) he would not let her perciue ſo much, but ſomewhat fiercely, anſwered. Ladie, I know not who, or what you are, and deſire neuer to come among ſuch bad and wicked people, as I haue mette withall in this place. Alas Sir, ſaid ſhee, if you thinke it meet that I ſhall conceale your name, I am well contented to doe it: neuertheleſſe, I know you to bee Lord Amadis de Gaule, brother to Galaor, whom I ſo dearly affect, as in honour of him, and for his ſake, I humbly entreate you to pittie and pardon my ſonne.
                  Theſe wordes moued his noble heart to ſuch cōpaſſion, as he could no longer diſſemble his diſpleaſure: but taking the Lady gently from the ground, he thus ſpake to her. Madame, my brother & my ſelfe haue receiued ſuch benefits & curteſies

from Gandalack your Father, as I would hazard my perſon to any perill, yea euen to my very lateſt gaſpe to doe him the beſt ſeruice conſiſting in my power, or any of his friends, for his ſake. But as concerning your Sonne, theſe men here preſent know right well, that I pardoned him before you could come to begge it of me: nay more, I vnbound him with mine owne hands, before your arriuall, without deſiring any other reuenge on him, but only on ſuch as maintaine wicked and vnlawfull cuſtomes. Among whom I name your 
                        •
                     usband as the chiefeſt man, whoſe knowledge of my name I care not for: becauſe he may hold himſelfe well aſſured, that I will neuer depart frō this Iſle, vntil he haue ſatisfied the lady that came hither with me. And therfore, if he be ſo iuſt and true of his word, as he would haue it appeare by open publication: let him meete mee in place conuenient for vs both, and then he ſhall know, whether he was carried away from mee by right or wrong, after I had obtained the maſtery ouer him.
                  Againe ſhe fell vpon her knees, ſaying, beleeue me ſir, hee will doe you reaſon, in any thing you can demand of him, as you may well perceiue, that hee was vtterly ignorant, in that which his people haue done contrary to his worde. For then hee had neither ſence nor vnderſtanding, which may well ſerue in his excuſe. Wherefore I ſweare to you vpon my faith, that if you pleaſe to goe along with me to him (becauſe he cannot by any meanes come to you) before you part one from another, I doubt not but you will bee reconciled louing friends. Madam, anſwered Amadis, I haue not any ſuſption of you: But I greatly doubt the condition of Gyants, who are cōmonly little gouerned by reasō, but carried away only by furie and crueltie. It is true Sir, (quoth ſhee) and yet notwithſtanding, I know his goodneſſe to bee ſuch, as you may well cred it him on mine aſſurance. Your word 
                        •
                     hen (anſwered Amadis) ſhall be my warrant, And ſo I will goe along with you.
                  So lacing on his helmet, faſtening his ſhield about his neck, and graſping his Sword faſt in his fiſt: he entred the Caſtle, with the wife to Balan, who quickly had aduertiſement of their arriuall, and therfore requeſted the knights preſence in his chamber. No ſooner were they entred, but the Giant rayſed himſelfe on his bed ſo well as hee could, ſaying, that he was moſt heartily welcome. Balan, anſwered Amadis, I know not how thou meaneſt, but I haue iuſt occaſion to complaine of the villanie offered me by thy men: being come (vpon thy words warrant) to combat with thee, and vrge reaſon for thy wrong to the Lady that conducted me hither. And albeit I had the better of thee, yet cowardly they aſſaulted me: although I thinke it was not done by thy command, being then in diſpoſition not to doe it. But be it howſoeuer, ſeeing thy Iuſtice vpon thine owne Sonne, I acquit both thee and them alſo: but not in the caſe of right appertayning to the Lady, for, death it ſelfe cannot hinder me from my duty in her behalfe which makes mee the more louingly derſie thee to giue her contentment. Otherwiſe, I muſt bee conſtrayned, to finiſh vpon thy Bodie, that which I haue already begunne: a matter much diſpleaſing to mee, for Gandalacks ſake, whom I dearely affect & eſteem, & to whom (as I am enformed) thou art nearely allied

in ſome nature of affinity.
                  Knight replyed Balan, although my extreamity of griefe is ſuch, to ſee my ſelfe vanquiſhed by one Knight only, as death would be a thouſand times more welcome to me: yet both theſe are of no value at all with me, in regard of that diſhonour acted by my ſonne and ſeruants. And did my ſtrength ſo much fauour me, as but to execute mine owne determinations, thou ſhouldeſt ſufficiently perceiue, how farre the power of my word extendeth. For the inſtant, I could doe no leſſe, or yeeld thee any better teſtimony of my truth: then deliuer him into thy power, that began ſo foule and iniurious an offence, albeit he is of no meane eſteem both to me and his mother. But ſeeing this ſubmiſſion cannot cōtent thee; command what elſe thou wouldeſt haue, and it ſhall be granted. For matters paſt betweene thee and me (anſwered Amadis) I am ſufficiently ſatisfied: but not in the wrongs that concerne the Lady. I am ready (replied the Giant) to ſuffer any ſuch condemnation as thou thinkeſt beſt, whereby to pleaſe both her and thee: with this conſideration, that the vnrecouerable life of her ſonne ſtands out of my reach, and therefore muſt needes bee anſwered by ſome thing, remayning in my power
                  Firſt of all then, ſaid Amadis, my will is, that thou deliuer her huſband, her daughter, and all their attendants out of thy priſons. Next, in ſteed of her ſonne, flaine by thee, condemne thy ſonne to make her amends, by preſent marriage of her daughter. For l

With whom we wil leaue Amadis, attending the curing of his Wounds: to tell you, what happened to Graſandor, after the huntſ-man had done his meſſage to him, and knew aſſuredly, that he was embarqued thence with the Lady his conducter.

                     How Graſandor followed in the queſt of Amadis, and what aduentures happened to him in his trauatie.
                  
                  
                     NOt long ſince you read, that Amadis being entred the Barque of the Ladie, who purpoſely came thither to ſeeke him: one of the Huntſmen came along the ſhoare, to whom he called, commanding him to bury the dead Knight, and acquaint Graſandor with the reaſon of his ſo ſudden departure. Which being imparted to Graſandor, hee was a long time penſiue, maruailing what aduenture had befallen him, to drawe him ſo farre off from him and Madame Oriana.
                  
                  Hereupon, giuing ouer further purſuing the game, he deſired him, to conduct him where the dead Knight lay, and being there ariued: hee ſawe him lie along, quite diſarmed, but neither Shippe or ſayle could hee diſ

                  From point to point, hee related the whole aduenture, according as hee had receiued it from the huntſ-man; yet with ſome regarde, as fearing to afflict her ouer much, whom it moſt concerned, I meane Madame Oriana: whoſe heart was ſo ſeuerely ſhut vp with griefe, as ſhee could not (for a long while) vtter one word.

Wherefore, deſpayring now of any redreſſe, and ſeeing his two other companions in ſuch pittifull condition: Hee turned bridle towards the Caſtle, for there was his lateſt refuge.

                        adis, being able to imagine no reaſon, why they two ſhould be thus ſundred, wherefore he ſaid. Belecue mee Lord Graſandor, I durſt haue ſworne you to be in a quite contrarie place: therfore let me entreate you to tell mee what aduenture drew you into theſe ſo farre diſtant parts.
                  
                     Graſandor related all the whole matter to him, as formerly you haue heard, and how hee trauailed in the queſt of Amadis: deſyring, if he knew any tidings of him, not to conceale them from him. Firſt

my Lord, anſwered Landin, you are not ignorant, that my Coſen Eliſeo and my ſelfe, were not long ſince diſcharged thence, with mine vnckle Don Quedragant, and Bruneo de bonne Mer, to goe to King Cildadan for ayde of men: becauſe the Nephew to King Arauigne, vnderſtanding the ouerthrowe of his Vncle, had taken poſſeſſion of his kingdome, and gaue vs (at our entrance) a very ſharpe battaile. Now although the victory fell to vs, and the enemies loſſe prooued to bee great: yet many men of worth periſhed on our ſide, and wee were ſent for the leuie of freſh forces. And becauſe good water grew ſcant with vs in our trauaile, the firſt place wee came to, was the Iſle of the Infanta; where it was tolde vs, that but lately before, a Knight paſſed thence with a Lady, and went purpoſely to fight with Balan the Gyant. Yet could we not know, what was the cauſe of this his attempt: only we were informed, that the gouernour of the Iſle was gone along with him, to ſee the iſſue of the cō
                     bate.
                  By further intelligence we gathered, that this Balan was of huge ſtature and ſtrength, whereby I am perſwaded, that none (other then Amadis) durſt vndertake the aduenture: and comparing the manner of his ſo ſudden leauing you, with the other circumſtances of your diſcourſe thinke therfore (vndoubtedly) it is hee. Before God, ſaide Graſandor, I am halfe offended, in that hee refuſed my companie in this action. How? anſwered Lindin, are you to learne now, that the Fates and Fortune, haue reſerued all haughty enterpriſes for him only, and to him they are due, and to none other? I perceiue it (quoth Graſandor) too apparantly: but how happened you to be ſeperated from your Coſen? By the greateſt miſ-hap, anſwered Landin, that could bee, as you ſhall inſtantly vnderſtand.
                  No ſooner tooke wee landing in this countrey, but he began to feele himſelfe not halfe fit for trauaile, by ſome ſudden apprehenſion of ſickneſſe ſeazing on him. Yet his vndantable minde was ſuch, as hee would not ſoi

So rode they on towards the Monaſterie, fully reſolued that if Eliſco were dead, they both ſhould be hanged: but if he were in good diſpoſition, then they would take ſome other deliberation.

                     w him, hauing often ſeen him with King Cildadan, before they forſooke his ſeruice, only thorough the ſmall account they made of him, when he became tributarie to King Liſuart; after which time, they fell to robbing & theeuing ſpoyling any that fell into their power.
                  Highly pleaſed was Galifon (his

misfortune conſidered) to ſee him-ſelfe and his brother at the command of ſuch a man, from whom he aſſured himſelfe of mercie: and therefore with teares in his eyes, thus hee began. For the honor of God, and true Nobilitie, I beſeech you Lord Landin, not to deale with vs as we haue iuſtly deſerued: but by declaring your goodneſſe and gentle breeding, referre the baſe liues of me and my brother, vnto your wonted mercy and pitty. Galifon (anſwered Landin) I neuer thought you to be ſuch men, hauing beene brought vp vnder ſo good a Prince, as is the King your Maſter, and among ſo many worthy Knights, as ordinarilie doe attend on him: among which number (God is my Iudge) I alwayes eſteemed you, and not to bee any ſuch men as I haue found yee. Alas ſir (quoth Galifon) deſire of rule and commanding, hath won mee this due deſert, as it hath done many more, as idle headed and improuident as my ſelfe. But be it howſoeuer, in your hands now lies all my remedie. What would you ſaid Landin, that I ſhould doe for you? Begge pardon replied Galifon, for me of the King, to whoſe mercy, and your good pleaſure, I willingly ſubmitte my ſelfe. I am contented ſo to doe: ſaid Landin, prouided, that herafter you change your vile condition, and become as vertuous, as you haue beene lewd and vicious. That I ſolemnly vow and ſweare to you, anſwered Galifon. Vpon that faithfull promiſe (quoth Landin) I diſmiſſe you: conditionally that you and your brother, within the ſpace of three weekes hence enſuing, whereſoeuer King Cildadan ſhall then bee, you doe render your ſelues vnto him, intirely obey him, and then I will compaſſe the means, that he may forget what hath paſt, and pardon you, if my power can ſtretch ſo far.
                  Moſt humbly did Galifon and his brother ſhew themſelues thankeful; and becauſe it grew to be late, they ſupped together with ſuch meane cheere, as both the time and place could afforde them. Earlie the next morning Graſandor, hauing heard Maſſe tooke leaue of the companie: and returned to the place where the Barque waited his comming, and the men not a little ioyfull, that hee had heard newes of Amadis. For, by the plaine appearing words of Landin, he made no doubt of meeting with him in ſhort time, or elſe to heare report of him, in the Iſle of the Infanta, for which cauſe hee intended the greater haſt. Being in the Barque, he enquired of the Patron, if hee could conueniently bring him to the Iſle of the Infanta? who made him anſwere, that knowing now the countrie wherein they were, hee could eaſilie ſet ſayle for that Iſland: and Graſandor earneſtly entreated him ſo to do.
                  So, without any farther delay, they weighed Anchors, and hauing the winde proſperous for them, ſayled all that night, till (about breake of day) they deſcried the Iſland. Then drawing to ſtarbord, and making vp into the Seas hight, about euening they came to coaſt it. Graſandor went a ſhoare, and mounted vp the Rock, vntill hee came to the great Towne, where meeting with the Gouernour (already returned backe) hee vnderſtood, that Amadis had conquered Balan, and friendſhippe was vnited betweene them, according as you heretofore heard. By my Knight hood, ſaid Graſandor, theſe are the beſt newes that euer I could aske for, not ſo much for knowing whether Amadis
                     
had finiſhed (to his high honour) a combate ſo perillous, beeing euermore inured to ſuch happy fortunes as this: but for my more certaine knowledge, where I may find him, for otherwiſe, I am not capable of any reſt, either by day or night, ſo ſtrictly am I bound by my vow.
                  I am verily perſwaded, anſwered the Gouernour, that many other haue ſeene extraordinarie actions of Armes, and (doubtleſſe) performed with no meane honour: but if they knew as well as I, his admirable valor in this haughty attempt, and reſolution in the execution, I thinke in (my poore opinion) they would confeſſe it to exceed all former preſidents whatſoeuer. Honor be attributed to heauen, ſaid Graſanaor, for this bleſſed fauour. And now there remaines no more to compleate my contentment, but onely to ſtay no where till I haue found him: may it therefore pleaſe you, to lend mee ſome one skilfull Mariner of yours, to be my helpe in this negotiation. With all my hart ſaid the Gouernour, and victualls alſo for your veſſell, if you are in ſuch neceſſity.
                  Then the Gouernour of the Iſle called for one of his chiefeſt Pilots, and preſenting him to Graſandor, ſaid. This man came from thence but yeſterday, and very well knowes how to conduct you thither. I thanke you Sir, replyed Graſandor. So after ſome little time of reſt, his deſire ſtil prouoking, him to ſee the man he ſought for the went aboard, and (without any ſiniſter fortune) landed the next morning in the Iſland of the Red Tower; enquiring there of Balans people, if Amadis were there as yet, or no. You ſhall find him aboue at the Caſtle, quoth they, and (if you pleaſe) wee will conduct you thither.
                  So they aſcended vp the Rocke, & as they ſet foot within the Caſtle gate: Graſandor eſpied Amadis, to whom he ran. and caught him faſt in his armes. My deareſt friend (quoth Amadis) what fortune hath conducted you hither? How fares Madame Oriana, and all the other Ladies in her companie? Truſt me Sir, anſwered Graſandor, all are in good health, conſidering their griefe for your ſo ſudden parting from them: And by their aduice, I put my ſelfe vppon your queſt, with ſolemne vow, not to giue ouer till I found you; otherwiſe Madame Oriana could not haue liued three dayes, ſuch was her extreame ſorrow for your abſence. Yet ſhe conſidered very wel, that you would not haue parted ſo peremptorily, if ſome earneſt occaſion had not enforced it. My returne, ſaide Amadis, ſhall bee ſooner (perhaps) then ſhee expects. That will be no diſcontent to mee anſwered Graſandor: onely let vs ſtay heere ſixe or eight dayes, becauſe the Seas haue beene ſomewhat offenſiue to mee. With right good will, replyed Amadis, for I would alſo haue my wounds thoroughly cured, before I did aduenture on any trauaile.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XXXVI.
                  
                     How Amadis being in the Iſland of the Red Tower, conferring with Graſandor; eſpied a ſmall Foiſt on the Sea, which put into the Port, hauing people in her, that told them tidings of the Armie, which was gone for Sanſuegua, and to the Iſles of Landes, or the Profound Iſle.
                     
                  
                  
                     VPon a day, as Amadis and Graſandor walked together in priuat conferrence, concerning the Princeſſe Oriana, being on the verie higheſt hill, or Rock of the Red Iſland: they deſcried a farre off on the Sea, a Foiſt of no great bigneſſe, making towards the Land. Hereupon, they began to deſcend, to know what perſons were in her, and no ſooner were they downe the Rocke; but one of their Squires (whom they had ſent before for news) returning backe, told them: that the veſſell was in the hauen, and it was a Maſter of the houſholde to Madaſima, for by that name hee had ſtiled him-ſelfe.
                  Scarcely had he finiſhed this report, but Nalfon, who was the man we now ſpeake off; came to meete them, and Amadis knew him immediatly: demanding of him, whether he went, and what newes hee could tell them. Nalfon, who likewiſe knew him perfectly, humbly ſaluted him, wondring not a little to ſee him in thoſe parts, where Balan commanded, and knowing alſo his hatred to him, becauſe hee was the man that ſlew his Father. Wherfore after ſome few courteſies paſſing betweene them, Nalfon ſaid. Truſt me my Lord, I would neuer haue enquired for you in this countrie, neither can I well imagine, what aduenture ſhould draw you hither. My honeſt friend, anſwered Amadis it was the will of Heauen to haue it ſo, and for what reaſon, I ſhall haue better leiſure to tell you: but firſt acquaint me, in what eſtate you left my brother Galaor and Galuanes, as alſo if you met with Dragonis? My Lord, quoth Nalfon, they neuer were in better condition, and I ſhall tell you ſome things, that will content you.
                  Know then Sir, that after Galaor, and Dragonis were diſlodged from Sobradiſa, with their Armie: My Lord and Maſter Galuanes, well accompanied with Souldiers, which he had leuied in the Iſle of Mongaza, came to ioyne with them, at a place commonly called, the Rocke of the Damoſell Enchantreſſe, which is on a Promentary farre in the Sea, I know not if euer you heard anie ſpeech thereof, or no. Yes that I haue replied Amadis, Garnate of the Dreadfull Dale heretofore told mee of it, how he being ſicke ſayled by this coaſt: but in regard of his great infirmitie then, hee could not make any proofe, of that which gladly he would haue done. Wherfore, I pray you diſcourſe (at large) what you know thereof, becauſe I haue beene credibly enformed, that many Knights of name, haue bin loſt in that paſſage. On my Faith ſir, anſwered Nalfon, not anything I know ſhall be concealed from you, and then he thus began.
                  The common 
                        •
                     ame is, that this Rock was ſo called by reaſon of a Damoſell there dwelling, who was (in her time) very curious in vnderſtanding all magicall Sciences, and

grew ſo expert in them, that ſhee wrought wonderfull things, and farre beyond the power of nature. Among the reſt, ſhee erected there the moſt ſumptuous building that euer was ſeene, and afterward, ſhe preuailed ſo powerfully by her skil: that ſhe drew thither (were they neuer ſo farre off) all Ships paſſing to Ireland, Norway, Sobradiſa, the Iſle of Lands, or the Profound Iſle; they not hauing any power or meanes (what windes ſoeuer blew) to helpe themſelues, but (by meere conſtraint) were brought to take landing not farre from her abyding, whence they could not be diſcharged, except ſhee pleaſed. There ſhe ſtayed them, and compulſiuely kept them, taking of their marchandiſes or goods, whatſoeuer liked her beſt: eſpecially errant Knights, if they had any aboard, and them ſhe would make (afterward) to combate one with another, euen to death many times, and therein ſhe tooke very great delight.
                  But as it often happeneth, that ſuc as deceiue others, come (in the end) to bee deceiued themſelues: ſo ſhee of whom I ſpeake, hauing heaped together infinite treaſures, and by ſuch meanes as I haue related, thinking ſtill to liue by her Artes, and contrarie to the courſe of nature, as if ſhe had power and command ouer the Starres; was taken tardy in her owne ſtrength. For the awefull arme of Heauen, no longer ſuffering the miſchiefe, which (vndeſeruedly) ſhee had exerciſed vpon many; did darken her vnderſtanding in ſuch ſort, that ſhe who was wont to abuſe the very beſt aduiſed, found her ſelfe ouerreached, by one merely ignorant in ſuch skill, not thorow any ingenuity or ſubtiltie of ſpirit remayning in him, but plainely, as I ſhall diſcourſe vnto you.
                  It came to paſſe, that among the number of Knights there by her detained, the man whom my inſtant report concerneth, borne in the I
                        •
                     le of Creete, a comely perſon, well diſpoſed, actiue in Armes, and aged about fiue and twenty yeares: was made choyce of by her, to bee her amorous friend, albeit the had (at all times) fully reſolued, neuer to come vnder any mans ſubiection, either by marriage, or otherwiſe. Yet now, in one poore mome
                        ••
                     , ſhe became ſo conquered by loue, and ſo farre ſtrayed from her former liberty, only by the outward behauiour of this Knight, a
                        •
                      to conclude, hee had the full conqueſt of her, and could commande more ouer her, then ſhe her ſelfe had power to doe. Herein ſhee conceiued ſuch extraordinarie liking, as 
                        〈◊〉
                      minute (almoſt) was omitted from their new familiar exerciſe. But he beeing diſcreete and well aduiſed, conſidered with himſelfe; that time would betray him in his amorous warfare, and the edge of her diſcontentment might cut off all thoſe ſweet embraces.
                  Obſeruing well this ſudden learned leſſon, hee contended with his owne humours, to ſhew her better ſatisfaction then euer bee had done: to the end, that ſhe conceiuing his loue addicted more to her, then any other reſpect hee had of himſelfe, might ſo increaſe her credulity, as to hit the marke hee moſt aimed at. Perceiuing her flame to wexe fiercer and fiercer, and all in a ſettled perſwaſion of his fidelity; he earneſtly importuned her, that as his loue was no way alterable to he
                        •
                     : he might receiue the ſelfe ſame reaſon from her, of no deceit on̄ her ſide, but that they both ballanced an equall and true affection, as by

many ſolemne vowes and proteſtations ſhe had often ſwore vnto him. And as a teſtimony of of her loyall meaning in this caſe, he deſired no more of her, but his entire freedom, and to enioy the like libertie of eſtate, as when he was (conſtrainedly) brought into that Iſle: whereto (at length) ſhe yeelded, and hence enſued her vtter ouerthrow.
                  For heere Sir I muſt tell you, that this proiect in the Knight, was to no other end, but only to be vtterly quitted of her, as well foreſeeing the mutabilitie and inconſtancy of women. Being (on a day) deuiſing with her, on the higheſt peece of all the Rock, embracing and kiſſing hir as he was wont to doe, perceiuing place and oportunitie fit for his intention: hee thruſt her ſuddainlie backward from off the Rock, ſo that in falling downeward vpon the ſeuerall crags and clifts, her body was quite torne in peeces, before it could get buriall in the Waues, which (at the length) ſwallowed them vp all. This being done, and the Knight nothing ſorie for it: he compaſſed the meanes to conuaie into his Shippe, whatſoeuer hee could carrie away from the Iſle, and with ſo many people as were therein, ſet away from thence home to hi owne countrie.
                  Here I may not omit to tell you, that he was conſtrayned to leaue an enchanted treaſure behinde him, remaining yet (as is affirmed fathfully) in one of the chambers of the great Pallace: no way able to bee ceazd on, by ſuch as ſince then haue landed there, not only to winne it by conqueſt, but alſo are debarred from entring the place where it is encloſed. And as yet, Serpents repaire thither in winter, which continue there likewiſe all ſummer, and hide themſelus there in very ſtrange manner. Moreouer, as I haue credibly heard, the doores belonging to this Chamber, are continually faſt cloſed, and a ſharpe Sword (to forbid entrance) thwarting the way hauing on the one ſide certaine letters as red as blood, and thoſe on the other ſide as white as Snowe. Theſe ſtrange charracters are ſaide to ſignifie and declare the name of him, by whom (vndoubtedly) this aduenture is to be ended. And hee muſt draw out the Sword, there thruſt in vp to the hilts, and barring the paſſage between both the doors For then they will open of them-ſelues, as by common rumor it is reported in many places.
                  Very penſiue was Amadis, all the time as Nolfon had declared theſe newes, one while concluding with his thoughtes (whatſoeuer might enſue thereon) to trauaile thither, and eſſay the finiſhing of the enchantment, wherein ſo many worthy Knights had fayled. Suddenly againe his opinion altered, being preſſed with an earneſt deſire of returning backe to the Encloſed Iſle. Notwithſtanding, he reſolued in the end, ſeeing hee was now ſo forward on the way, to paſſe on ſomewhat farther, yet hee made no noted or inſtant appearance thereof but ſeeming careleſſe and negligent of that which had been ſaid, falling into another kinde of conferrence, demanded of Nolfon, what way Galaor and his Army tooke afterward? My Lord (quoth hee) after hee had ſtayed ſome few dayes in the harbour, very neere vnto the Rock: he ſet ſayle directly for the Profound Iſle, as hoping to enter it by way of ſuprizall. But they of the country hauing ſome ſuſpition; before wee could come thither, had betaken themſelues to Armes, and awayted for vs vpon the ſhoare, where they

found vs worke enough to doe, before we could compaſſe any means of landing. For one of the 
                        •
                     oſens to the late King, conducted the people, and had ſo animated them againſt vs; as you neuer ſawe men fight more courageouſly, nor with better iudgement.
                  But the valour of the Lords, Galaor, Galuanes, and Dragonis (they hauing leapt into the water vp to the chinne, and fighting with vndantable reſolution) did ſo hearten and embolden on our men in following them: that our enemies were enforced to retire, and in deſpight of all they could doe, wee entred in vpon them; but not without great ſlaughter of our men, & a wonderfull butchery of the contrarie ſide, wee purſuing them ſtill into the Citie, where their chiefe and principall Captaine, was ſoon numbred among the dead. Then did we beleauger them on all ſides, which droue them to ſuch aſtoniſhment, as (ſeeing themſelues deſtitute of a guide and leader) ſoone after they required a parlee, which accordingly was granted them.
                  For the effecting of this buſines, foure were delegated among them, who came to Prince Galaor and our other Captaines; with whom they ſo capitulated, that they yeelded themſelues. Prouided that their libertie and goods might remaine intire vnto them: which was afforded them willingly. And the very ſame day we entred into the Citie, where (before the weeke was fully expired) Dragonis was crowned King. Afterwarde, hauing receiued their homage, and oath of loyall alleageance, as wel of the Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, as of the Commons in generall: Prince Galaor, and Galuanes my Maſteer, perceiuing that their departure thence would not be ſo ſoone as they had intended; diſpatched me towardes the Queen Briolania, as alſo to Madaſima, to acquaint them with all the good newes which I haue told you.
                  But heard you nothing (quoth Amadas) of Quedragant and Brunco? My Lord replied Nolfon, before I diſlodged from the Campe, ſome eſcaping from the Iſles of Landes, and from the Citie of Ara
                           •
                        igne, hoping for ſafety in the kingdome of the Profound Iſle: came thither, and by them we vnderſtood, that one of the kinred to Arauigne, backt by the people of the countrie, had giuen a great battaile to our friends, that purpoſely came to aſſaile thē. But ours had the better, and droue them to flight, ſince when we heard no further how matters haue happened. Wee ſhall heare that no doubt (ſaide Graſander) at better leaſure, and in more ample manner. So continuing on their conference, they entred into Balans Caſtle, and Amadis went to viſit him lying ſtill on his bedde, being (as yet) not able to walke about. And they two beeing alone, Amadis tolde him, that he had receiued certaine intelligences, whereby he was conſtrained to departe thence the next morning, earneſtly deſiring him: that (according as hee had promiſed) he would reſtore to Darioletta her husband, daughter, ſeruants, and the Barque which they had brought thither with them, & whatſoeuer elſe he had taken from them. To the end, that they might fayle away to the Encloſed Iſle at their pleaſure. Moreouer, that

                     ee remaine (quoth Amadis) till

                      bee

of yeares fit for Knight hood, and I am well aſſured, that the beſt entertainment can be made to a man, will there be done vnto him, and only for your ſake.
                  Lord Amadis, anſwered the Gyant, though (heretofore) my full intent and purpoſe was, to doe you what harme I could poſſibly deuiſe, yet now I am turned quite contrary, and loue you as dearely as I can doe my ſelfe, accounting it as my only felicitie, to be your ſeruant, as (indeede) I am, wherefore, preſently I will take order, to fullfill thoſe things which you haue enioyned me, and aſſure you alſo, vpon my Faith, that ſo ſoone as I haue recouered my health: I will viſit the Palace of Apolidon, only to ſee you, and will keepe you companie, when and whether you ſhall pleaſe to command me. I pray you doe ſo, ſaid Amadis, and if you would haue any thing elſe with me, commaund it, and therein (truſt me) you ſhall be obeyed.
                  Moſt kindly did the Giant return him thankes, and louingly embracing one another, tooke their finall farewell for the next morning. But Batan came not ſo ſoone to the Encloſed Iſle, as he intended, and Amadis expected, becauſe after his departure, he receiued aduertiſement: that Quedragant and Bruneo, (thorow want of men) were held in the Cittie of Arauigne, ſtill beſiged. Whereupon, he beate his dromms througout all his marches, and aſſembled together a worthy band of Souldiers, which hee led thither in perſon: whence enſued quickly, not only the reduction of the place beſiged, but likewiſe the whole countries both of Arauigne, and Sanſueg
                           ••
                        , as elſewhere you ſhall heare more at large.
                  Let it ſuffice then, that after the two knights of the Encloſed Iſle were aboard their Shippe, and ready to weigh Anchors: Amadis deſired Nolſon to furniſh him with a guide, that could conduct him to the Iſland of the Damoſell Enchantreſſe, becauſe he had a minde to ſee it. With all my heart anſwered Nolfon and I my ſelfe will beare you companie thither, if ſo you pleaſe to permit me. And one thing I can aſſure yee, that now is the beſt ſeaſon of all the yeare, for ſeeing the ſingularities of the place: the ſtearn froſts and colds being already with-drawne, whereby horrible and venemous creatures retire themſelues into their hoales, dennes, and cauerns in the Earth. It ſhall ſuffice me replied Amadis, to haue but one of your skillfull Mariners, and not to hinder you, in an employment ſo ſerious.
                  
                     Nolſon herein fulfilled his mind, deliuering him a Pilate of expert iudgement, and ſo, commending him to God: ſayled on to the Iſland of Mongaza, and Amadis with Graſandor, directly to the Rock of the Damoſell Enchauntreſſe. So aptlie did the winds fit their purpoſe, that (within ſix dayes) they did diſcerne it, and ſaw it ſo high, that it ſeemed to them to be aboue the Cloudes. comming into the Port, there they found a Barque lying at Anchor, all alone, and no one to haue care of it: whereby they immagined, that they to whom it belonged, were aſſcended vp the Rock, and feared no diſaſter of the veſſell. Then Amadis, being deſirous to attemp the aduenture by himſelfe; ſpake thus to Graſandor. My deare friend and companion, let me in treate you to attend mee heere till to morrow morning, by which time I may bee returned, or perhaps ſooner: And if my fortune ſtand faire, from aloft

I will giue you ſome ſigne, whereby to finde me. But if within three daies you heare no tydings of me: then aſſure your ſelfe, that mine enterpriſe hath ſucceded ill, & then proceede in the reſt as you ſhall ſee occaſion.
                  
                     Graſandor ſeeming ſomewhat offended, thus anſwered. How? my Lord, do you think I haue not courage enough, to endure what trauaile ſoeuer can bee in this place, eſpecially, being in your company? where it would much more encreaſe, if I had but as little as the value of amity. I promiſe you dear friend, ſaide Amadis, neuer any ſuch opinion of you, did once enter into my minde, hauing knowen you in ſo many worthie actions; as deſeruedly beſtowes the eſteeme on you, to bee one of the beſt Knights in the worlde. And ſeeing you thinke good to beare me companie; I haue a great deſire that it ſhould be ſo.
                  So hee commanded a planke to be laide for landing, and they two only went aſhore (
                        •
                     rmed at al parts, with their Swords and Shields readily prepared, whenſoeuer or howſoeuer they ſhould be aſſailed. This done, they beganne to mount the Rocke, by a little tracke ſomewhat rough and vneaſie, ſcrambling vp by little and little: till they came to an Hermitage, wherein ſtoode a Statue of Braſſe crowned, holding in both hands (iuſt before the breſt) a Table of Copper guilded, wheron were engrauen certaine Greeke Letters and Characters, eaſie enough for them to reade that vnderſtood the language. And yet it was aboue two hundred yeares, ſince they had beene engrauen by the Damoſell Enchantreſſe: who was in her time, the moſt expert in Magicke Artes, that euer had beene ſince, and daughter to one named Finctor, of the Cittie of Arges, in the countrie of Greece.
                  
                  Now were our Knights ſo weary, and out of breath, as they were able to goe no further: wherefore they ſate downe on a ſeate of ſtone, to obſerue the Statue more aduiſedly. It appeared to them an admirable peece of Arte, eſpecially the Table and Characters: which Amadis began to reade, as well hee could, although his ſtay in Greece was not long, when he conquered the Monſter Endriagus; and the writing on the Table, was as followeth.
                  The inſcription on the Table.

                        At ſuch time as the Great Iſland ſhal flouriſh, and therein ſhall be aſſembled the flower of Chiualrie and of beauty, and the land gouerned by a moſt potent and magnanimious Prince: Then ſhall hee come from thence, to whom the Sword and enchanted Treaſures are deſtined, and not (tell then) ſhall they come to any mans power.
                     
                  
                  Full well did Amadis perceiue, that this aduenture was not appointed for him, but perſwaded him-ſelfe, that it was reſerued for his ſonne Eſplandian onely, who was borne the faireſt and goodlieſt perſon liuing: neuertheleſſe, hee concealed it to himſelfe, and asked Graſandor whether hee vnderſtood the inſcription, or no? No truely, quoth hee, for I neuer was in place where the language was ſpoken. Vpon my faith anſwered Amadis, this is ſome very ancient Prophecy: And then he tolde him all that it contained. I know not, replied Graſandor, wherefore it ſhould bee thus predicted, except it aymed only at your ſelfe: you being ſon to the moſt worthy Prince, that euer girded ſword by his ſide, and

the very choyſeſt Lady for beautie of her time, as euidently may be diſcerned, by the other eſpeciall beauties remayning in her. Therefore, let vs boldly aſcend vp higher, becauſe it ſhall bee as much blame to you in forbearing to trie it, as preſumption in any other that ſhall dare to attempt it. Nor ſpeake I this without iuſt occaſion; becauſe my hope is, to ſee that by your meanes, which no man elſe in theſe dayes is worthie to ſee, Amadis beganne to ſmile, perceiuing with what zeale Graſandor ſpake, and ſaid Seeing it muſt be ſo, let vs goe on then and vp to the Pallace, before darke night preuent vs in our determination.
                  From the hermitage thus they parted, and followed ſtill the track that guided them: but with ſuch difficultie and daunger, as they had many downe ſlidings, and very perillous falles. Yet worſe then all this befell them, for day light fayled, and they were enforced (by the nights extreame darkeneſſe) to ſtay vpon a little plaine till morning: where they lay downe ſo vneaſilie, as they could not take a iote of reſt. And therfore they fell into diſcours of the painefull vſurie Fortune now paid them, for the former pleaſures (borrowed of their friends) in the Encloſed Iſle. All which notwithſtanding, ſaid Amadis, were it not for feare of Orianaes diſtaſte, and ſuſpition of the griefe wherein now ſhe may bee: happen to mee what may, I would goe ſee the Campe of Bruneo & Agraies, before I returned to her.
                  Hereat Graſandor began to ſtartle, and ſaid. By my faith Sir, you will make her die with meere doubt fearing whether you be aliue or no. And ſo much the rather, becauſe I promiſed and ſwore to her, to bring you back againe with mee, ſo ſoone as I could finde you. Wherfore, let me aduiſe you, and herein ſomewhat ouer-rule you, to obey her, rather then your owne raſh deſires. Afterward, according as we ſhall learne by others informations, we may either goe to them, or ſend ſome ſupplie, if neede require. I think (quoth Amadis) we may doe much better, at our parting hence, to ſhape our courſe for the Iſland of the Infanta, from whence I will ſend a Gentleman to Balan, requeſting his aſſiſtance for them: which I am ſure hee will performe in the beſt manner, and ſo we may (in the meane while) ſet on to the Encloſed Iſle, to prepare entertainment for him, againſt he comes t

                     ither.
                  Thus our two Knights ſpent out the moſt part of the night, ſometimes napping and nodding, and other whiles waking, till day appeared: when vp they roſe, and mounted vp the Rocke againe, till they came to the entrance of a greater plaine, where they beheld huge ruines of very antient buildings. Proceeding ſtill on, they came to an Arch of Marble, whereon ſtood a Statue of Alablaſter, being made for a Woman, and ſo ingeniouſly wrought, that nothing wanted but life it ſelfe. In her right hand, ſhee held a Pen, as if ſhee were readilie wrighting, and in her left hand, a role of Parchment, with Greeke letters thereon, contayning theſe words.
                  The Inſcription on the Role.

                        That Science is moſt certaine, whereby we profit more before the Gods, then wee doe among Men: becauſe the one is holie, and the other vaine and vnprofitable.
                     
                  
                  Behold, quoth Amadis, excellent knowledge deliuered in very fewe words, for if euery man vnderſtood

rightly, what graces heauen hath beſtowed vpon him: many would more addict themſelues to vertuous actions, then they doe, and ſhunne thoſe vices which leade to perdition. So paſſing on farther they entred into a baſe Court, full of fragments of Collumnes, as well Ionick and Tuſcane, as Dorick. Likewiſe, of many ancient Medalls, and perſonages ſo artificially carued, as it was impoſſible to looke on better. Nor had the iniurie of time much offended them, but gaue them leaue ſtill to containe, a very eſpeciall, apparance of their ſingularitie: which

                  As he turned from one ſide to another, he came into a very goodly hall, ſo richly painted, as it was moſt wonderfull to behold, and looking about it: they perceiued an entrance into a faſt lookt vp chamber, hauing two doores of bright ſhining ſtone, in the midſt of which doores was a Sword ſo transfixed, as it paſſed quite thorow vp to the Croſſe. Hereby they gathered apparantly, that the treaſurs and enchan

                     , then any Ruby of the Eaſt: hee beheld ſeauen letters in Greeke (redder then any fire) to bee vpon the one ſide, and ſome few other (whiter then Snow) vpon the other ſide, all concording after this manner.
                  The Prophecie engrauen on the Sword.

                        In vaine doth the Knight beſtow his paines, that ſhall eſsay (what force ſoeuer or ſtrength remaineth in him) to draw forth this Sword: except it be he (only deſtined hereto) by the ſame Letters, as the Statue of Braſſe hath written in the Table it beares, and carries vpon him the ſame Charracters as are engrauen on eyther ſide of this pommell. For this prediction was ſet downe by her, who was not to be ſeconded by any (of her time) for moſt admirable intelligence in all Magicall Sciences.
                     
                  
                  Hereby Amadis tooke occaſion to marke theſe red letters more aduiſedly, then formerly he had done, and called to minde, that Eſplandian had the verie like vpon his bodie: wherfore he reſolued aſſuredly that only he muſt end this meruaile, neuertheleſſe, he demanded of Graſandor, what was his opinion in this caſe? So helpe me God, quoth he, I vnderſtand well enough the contents of the white Letters: but for the redde, I am able to ſay iuſt nothing. Nor I (anſwered Amadis) albeit I imagine, that both you and I haue ſeene the verie like, vpon ſomebody that wee know. You ſay verie true, replied Graſandor for your ſonne as I haue heard, brought the like into the World with him from his mothers wombe, and ſurely in mine opinion, they are the very ſame. Notwithſtanding, if you had not quickned my memorie, I ſhould neuer haue thought on it. And therefore make no complaint of your Fortune, if you faile in this enterpriſe: becauſe, for ought I can perceiue, you haue begot him, that muſt carrie this honor from you.
                  
                     Amadis muſing to himſelfe while ſuddenly ſtarting ſaid. I am of your minde, for ſo haue I gathered, by the Table on the Image of Braſſe.

Return we then back againe, quoth Graſandor, and leaue the reſt to bee ended by him, to whom the deſtenies haue made their promiſe. So we muſt bee inforced to doe, ſaide Amadis, albeit I am ſomewhat offended, that I may not carrie away his ſword with mee. By my faith, replied Graſandor, if you ſhould offer to get it, your hinderance may be more then you imagine; and yet it may fal out, not to proue ſo good a ſword as your owne. Moreouer, when I conſider how you obtained it: neuer could any Knight attaine to a fairer fortune, nor more beſeeming a man, than yours was then. This hee ſpake, in regard that Amadis wonne it, by approouing himſelfe to bee the moſt loyall and perfect louer, that euer loued: according as in the Second booke of this Hiſtorie, hath been oftentimes declared vnto yee.
                  Hereupon, they returned backe by the ſame way they came, and paſſing againe among the Antiquities: Amadis ſtayed there a while, better to beholde them. The more hee looked on them, the more hee commended their rare perfections, both in moldings, friezes, & chapters, lying among the ruines of thoſe famous buildings. And no way could hee turne his eye, but he beheld many fractures of ſingular carued parſonages, the very muſcles obſerued to the life, and ſuch perſpectiue where occaſion required it: that (in his opinion) it reliſhed more of ſome diuinitie, then to be performed by the skill of man in workemanſhip.
                  As hee continued in theſe meditations, a knight armed with a white Armour, and holding his ſworde ready drawen, came to them, courteouſly ſaluting them, as they did the like to him. Then he demanded of thē, whether they were of the Encloſed Iſle, or no? We are, anſwered Graſandor: but why doe you moue that queſtion? Becauſe (quoth the other) I found a Batque beneath, and men therein, who tolde mee, that two Knights belonging to the Pallace of Apolidon, were aſcended vp this Rocke: but they concealed their names from mee, as I did mine from them. Nor deſire I any thing elſe, but peace and friend-ſhippe with them, beeing caſually come hither in purſuite of a knight, who (by trompery) is eſcaped from mee, with a Damoſell forcibly carried away by him. Friend, ſaid Graſandor, in courteſie let me entreate you to take off your Helmet, or to tell vs your name. If you will ſwear to me, replied the Knight, whether you know my Lord Amadis or no, and that you will doe the like to mee: I am well contented, otherwiſe you ſpeake but in vaine. By my faith, quoth Graſandor, we are two of the beſt friends hee hath, and therefore you may well be knowen to vs.
                  So the Knight diſarmed his head, ſaying: You may now knowe mee well enough, if you be ſuch as you haue ſworne your ſelues to mee. Hardly had hee concluded his wordes, but Amadis ran and caught him in his armes, ſaying. Brother Gandalin, is it poſſible that fortune ſhould cauſe vs to meet in this maner? Much amazed was Gandalin, to ſee himſelfe thus embraced, and by a man vnknowne to him, and vnable to coniecture who he ſhould be: wherefore Graſandor ſuddenly ſaid. Why how now Gandalin? Haue you forgotten your Lord Amadis? Amadis? anſwered Gandalin, may it bee poſſible? Then falling on his knee; whether he would or no, hee kiſſed his hand, before

                     Amadis could any way preuent him: but then demanded of him, how and by what meanes he came thither? Beleeue me my Lords, replied Gandalin, your equalls in loyalty of affection, would gladly know as much concerning you, as you now demand of me, you being as farre from them, as this place is from their abyding. Neuertheleſſe, to giue you content, I will declare the whole truth vnto you.
                  Know then, that being with Bruneo and others, who are yet in conquering the countries of Arauigne & Sanſuegua, returning from a cruell battayle, which the Kings Nephew gaue vs at our entrance, and wherein many worthy men loſt their liues: one day (among other) a Damoſell belonging to the kingdom of Norway, attired all in black, came into the Tent of Agraies, deſiring him on her knees (in no mean plenty of teares) to giue her reſcue in a wrong done vnto her. Agraies cauſing her to riſe, and ſit downe by him, demanded the cauſe of her ſad complaint, and hee would redreſſe it ſo much as lay in him to doe. Alas Sir (quoth ſhe) you haue good reaſon to helpe mee, becauſe I am both a ſubiect and ſeruant to the King, who is father to Madame Olinda your wife: for whoſe ſake and honour, I deſire you to aſſiſt mee with one of your Knights, for recouery backe of my daughter, whom the Lorde of the great Tower on the Sea ſhoare, hath forcibly taken from mee, being thereto onely emboldened, becauſe I would not giue him her in mariage. And my reaſon is, in regarde hee is neither ſo noble, nor deſcended of ſo good a houſe, as my husband was: but rather is of baſe and ſeruile condition, vſurping the place he poſſeſſeth, vpon his neighbours, whom he hath ſince expelled. The father to my daughter was brother to Don

                     ed to him, the wicked man is ſo cruelly minded, as hee doth dayly deny mee, ſo that my dayes can haue no long continuance, except (by Armes) he be compelled to reſtore her.
                  Damoſell, anſwered Agraies, why doth not your King do you iuſtice, as (in right) to him belongeth? My Lord, quoth ſhe, he is ſo ouerſpent in yeares, and decayed in bodie, as hee is not able to gouerne himſelf, or any other: neither doth hee euer come forth of his bedde, only through his extreamitie of age and ſickneſſe. The man then you ſpeaks of, replyed Agraies, is his abyding farre from hence? No Sir (quoth ſhee) in leſſe ſpace then a day and a halfe, the winde ſitting conueniently, wee may by Sea eaſily ſayle thither. Then I made tender of my ſeruice, as willing to goe along with the Lady. But my Lord Agraies would not conſent thereto: except I made him faithfull promiſe, of returning backe againe to him, after I ſhould haue combated the Knight, without attempting any further, if (with honour) I might ſafely doe it.
                  My promiſe made to that effect, and I ſufficiently furniſhed, I went aboard with the Damoſell, in a Barque which ſhee had purpoſely brought with her: and the Sea was ſo calme and fauourable to vs, that on the morrow (about mid-day) we tooke landing, and the Lady conducted mee thither where her daughter was detayned. At my entrance

into the Port, I called out aloude

                     ded of mee, what I would haue, whereto, thus I replied. Tell thy maſter that hee muſt quickly deliuer a Damoſell, which hee forcibly hath taken from her which is in my companie, or yeelde mee a reaſon why he will not: otherwiſe, not a man ſhall iſſue forth, but he dies the death. By my Soule (quoth he I ſpake to) your threatning aſſures vs ſufficiently what you are: neuertheleſſe, doe but ſtay a little, and (I thinke) you ſhall heare other tidings.
                  I withdrew ſomewhat off, and tarried not long, but they of the Tower opened the gates, and forth came a Knight well mounted, hauing on a yellow colourd Armour, and at the length of a carriere, hee called to me, ſaying. Knight, thou that (without any diſcretion) thretneſt mee that knowes thee not, ſay, what doeſt thou demand of mee? I anſwered, that I neither did or would threaten nor defie him, vntill I vnderſtood the cauſe, why hee kept the daughter of the Lady here preſent with me) from her. Well, ſaid he, admit it were ſo, what is that to thee? I hope (quoth I) to reuenge her wrong, and to make thee reſtore her againe, whether thou wilt or no. We ſhall ſoone try that, ſaid the other: And ſo giuing his horſe the ſpurre, hee came running mainly againſt me, as I did the like to him, couching our Launces ſo conueniently, that the ſhiuers of them flew vp into the ayre very gallantly.
                  Setting hand to our ſwordes, a tough battaile began betweene vs, which continued (almoſt) to the euening: but in the end, the right being on my ſide, the victory fell to mee, hauing him downe vnder my foot, and my ſword ready to ſmite off his head. But he calling for mercy, prayed me to ſaue his life, & he would do whatſoeuer I would haue him. Why then ſaid I, deliuer this Lady her daughter againe, and ſweare neuer to take maide or wife contary to their owne liking: which faithfully he vowed to doe. Here-upon pretending to goe fetch the Damoſell forth, hee went into the Tower, and here he ſtayed not long but I ſaw him embarqued on the Sea, armed as I left him, and the Damoſell with him, hee calling out thus aloude to mee Knight, wonder not that I haue broken my word with thee, for the power of Loue hath thereto compelled mee, being not able to liue one houre, without her whom I thus carrie away with me. And ſeeing it is out of mine owne abilitie, either to conquer or gouerne my ſelfe: I pray thee, finde no fault with this that I haue done. And becauſe neither thou, nor her Mother, ſhall hope hereafter to ſee her any more: behold, I will now conuey her to ſuch a place, where thou ſhalt neuer heare any tidings of her.
                  Speaking theſe words, he rowed away, and the Damoſel wrung, and wreſted her hands, whereat I conceiued ſuch griefe, that death was much more pleaſing to mee then Life. For the mother beganne to make ſuch ſtrange Lamentations, tearing both her hayre and Garments; caſting in my teeth, that ſhe had receiued more wrong by mee then from the Knight himſelfe. For (quoth ſhe) while my daughter was in the Tower, there alwayes was hope of recouering her againe: but now, all expectation is vtterly fruſtrated, being carried to a place vnknowne, and whereof you are the

only occaſion, by not executing the victory, when it remained in your power to doe it. Now am I our of hope of any remedy, and not only is the paines you haue taken for mee thankleſſe: but alſo I haue iuſt cauſe, to complaine of you before all men I ſhall euer meet withall.

ſuch, and ſo vnfayned is my affection to her.
                  
                     Amadis, who had many thouſand times felt himſelfe in the ſame extremitie, began to take compaſſion on him: Neuertheleſſe, thus hee anſwered. Although what you haue ſaid, is in ſome meaſure excuſable: yet the Knight that hath purſued in ſearch of you, may not faile in his promiſe made to the Ladie, for otherwiſe hee deſerues to bee reprehended before all worthie perſons: I know it well ſir, replied the knight and am likewiſe contented to put my ſelfe into his power, prouided that he will bee ſo kinde vnto me as carry me back againe to the Ladie, and there pleade my cauſe for mee, that ſhe will be pleaſed to ſuffer me enioy her daughters as my wife, becauſe now ſhe hath made choiſe of me before any other. Is that true? quoth Amadis to the Damoſell. Yes ſir, ſaid ſhee, albeit heretofore hee detayned me againſt my will neuertheleſſe obſeruing the truth, and integritie of his affection, I am now fully minded to forget all former violences, both pardoning, and promiſing to accept him in marriage. Beleeue me ſaid Amadis, I am very glad of it, and Gandalin, if you will follow mine aduice, worke with the Mother ſo much as you can, that this happy wedding may bee effected. I ſhall Sir (quoth hee) with all my heart, and reioyce to ſee ſo good a concluſion.
                  So they went on, to returne to the Sea ſhoare: but the night preuenting them, they were enforced to ſtay in the Hermitage, diſcending the next morning downe to their men, who awaited their comming in the Barque. As Gandalin tooke his leaue, Amadis and Graſandor intreated him, to recommend them to Agraies, and their other friends there: aduiſing him and them alſo, to returne ſpeedily to the Encloſed Iſle, where they ſhould heare other tidings. Thus Gandalin, ſayled thence to the Lady mother, where, hauing deliuered both her daughter and the Knight: hee laboured the matter ſo effectually, that (notwithſtanding all former ſpleene) the mother quickly conſented to her Daughters minde. Gandalin was not a little amazed hereat, but remembring, that womens conſtancie was as certaine, as the continuall turning tides of the Ocean: hee could not chuſe but ſmile, and leauing them to their further affaires, went aboarde the Barque, returning to Agrates, who was highly pleaſed with Gandalins good ſucceſſe, as alſo his fortunate meeting with Amadis and Graſandor in ſo ſtrange a manner.
                  But now wee muſt change our purpoſe, to them that were bound for the Encloſed Iſle. with an earneſt deſire to ſee their wiues, whom they had left in no meane melancholie, only for their abſence. Amadis and Graſandor, departing from the Iſland of the Damoſell Enchantreſſe, found the Seas and Windes ſo fauourable that (without any impeachment whatſoeuer) they entred the port of the Encloſed Iſle. As they mounted vp the Rock, and came to the Monaſterie, which Amadis had cauſed to bee builded: they ſaw before the Gate, a Damoſell attired all in mourning, and two Squires with her, holding their Pal

                     raies by the bridles. They ſaluted her very courteouſly, as ſhe did the like to them, and then they entred into the Church to performe their Oriſons: in the meane while, the Damoſell enquired of one of the Monks there ſtanding, what they were. The religious man anſwered her, that the

one was the Lord of the Iſle, and the other was his noble friend and companion.

                      and his, that hee is become a priſoner to the very greateſt enemy hee hath in the world, and it is impoſſible for him to be thence deliuered, without ſuch help as I hope for in your goodneſſe, and no man elſe whatſoeuer. Beleeue it Sir, quoth ſhee, my knees ſhall neuer part from this earth, nor mine armes from about your legges (except thereto you forcibly conſtraine me) till you grant what I am to demand of you. Amadis perceiuing both her importunitie and obſtinacie, knew not wel what to ſay, fearing to ſtand obliged by his promiſe, for the vndertaking of ſome ſuch matter, which well he might repent at leaſure: as indeed hee did. Neuertheleſſe, he was ſo moued to compaſſion, ſeeing her teares flowe forth ſo inceſſantly: that hee granted what ſhee deſired, requiring that hee might know her name. Then ſhe caught him by both the hands, and (whether hee would or no) kiſſed them ſweetly; and addreſſing her ſpeech
                        •
                     s to Graſandor, beganne in this manner.
                  Sir Knight, I pray you remember, that Lord Amadis hath made this promiſe to me, who am the wife to Archalaus the Enchanter, and him hee keepeth in priſon, beeing the greateſt enemy hee hath in the world. But if Heauen were ſo pleaſed, this hatred may conuert it ſelfe into the greater amity, by ſuch happy meanes as may bee wrought. Much offended was Amadis, to ſee himſelfe deceiued by the ſubtilty of this woman, and gladly hee would haue reuoked his promiſe ſworne vnto her: notwithſtanding, hee could not blame the woman, who had iuſt reaſon to imploy her vtmoſt paines, for the benefit of her husband, as euery good wife elſe ought to doe, and thus hee anſwered her. By the faith I beare to God (Ladie) you haue made too large a requeſt to me, for in deſpite of any perill that can come to me, I would not conſent to ſuch a matter: but only in regarde of the promiſe I haue made yee, and it is the firſt that euer I granted to Ladie or

Damoſell, whereof I repented my ſelfe afterward.
                  With theſe words, hee and Graſandor mounted on / horſebacke, commanding the wife of Archalaus, to follow him to the Pallace of Apollidon: but before they could get thither, Oriana and Mabila had intelligence of their arriuall. What pleaſure they conceiued, by this their ſo long expected comming, it is impoſſible for me to expreſſe: yet ſuch it was, that not only they, but all the Ladies and Gentlewomen went to attend their entrance into the Parke. At their meeting, there needes no other queſtion to bee made, but the like kiſſes and embraces paſſed betweene them, euen as yong married couples vſe to doe, vpon the very day of their choiſeſt delighting, to yeelde the truer teſtimonie of their Faiths firmneſſe. And theſe ſweete ceremonies vſhered them to their Chambers, where (no doubt) but they paid ſound arrearges, for their ſo long abſence from their ſweete Miſtreſſes.
                  On the morrow morning, being at Maſſe, the wife of Archalaus came againe, and fell before the feete of Amadis, intreating him to performe his promiſe, which hee had ſworne to on her husbands behalfe, and which (accordingly) hee yeelded vnto. Afterwarde, before he would ſit downe at the Table, accompanied with all the traine of Ladies, hee went to ſee him in his Cage, where he found his head and beard to bee as white as Snow, extending down ſo farre as his girdle. Vnfaſhionable hee appeard to be in euery part, great, crooked, and ſomewhat deformed, but his lookes fiery and much to bee feared. Wherfore, ſo ſoone as the Ladies beheld him, they were greatly affraid of him: eſpecially the Princeſſe Oriana, who formerly had made proofe of his mallice, when hee carried her away, and when Amadis came to her happy reſcue, as hath beene declared in the firſt Booke of this our famous Hiſtorie.
                  Now although Archalaus ſaw his wife among the reſt: yet he ſeemed to make no account thereof, which cauſed Amadis to aske him, whether he knew her: or no? Yes, (quoth he) I know her. Art thou pleaſed (ſaid Amadis) at her coming hither? Sufficiently ſaid he, if it be about my buſineſſe, otherwiſe, I take no care at all. For conſidering the condition wherein I haue liued, euer ſince I fell into thy handes (being reſolued to ſuffer patiently, any harme whatſoeuer can happen to me) my heart is ſetled, and my perſwaſion confirmed (in meere deſpight of thee) to liue thus, and no otherwiſe, till I die. But liſten mee ſaid Amadis, if for her ſake, I ſhould ſet thee at libertie: wouldſt thou accept it ſo thankfully, as to extend the like to me, if my caſe were anſwerable to thine now? Yes, quoth he, if thou didſt ſend for her on thine owne inſtigation, but if by her wit and cunning ſhe hath preſumed on this enterpriſe, and wone ſome promiſe from thee againſt thy liking I neither can or ought render any thankes to thee therefore, becauſe good workes done perforce, deſeruedly (of themſelues) doe loſe their merit, and therefore I pray thee to tell me the truth of all.
                  
                     Amadis did then declare vnto him, how hee mette with her at the Monaſterie, in what manner ſhee had deceiued him, and gotten his deliuerance. Howſoeuer things haue paſt, ſaid Archalaus; I will plainely tell thee my minde. If thou hadſt taken pittie on me in Lubania, when I my ſelfe deſired mercie

of thee: aſſure thy ſoule, that all the remainder of my life, I had continued thy bounden and perfect friend. But at this inſtant, thou being conſtrained to releaſe me, without any deſire of mine, or ſute made on mine owne behalfe for it, but in meer performance of thy promiſe: ſo will I receiue this freedome (if thou wilt let me enioy it) and with as much content as thou deſerueſt. Otherwiſe, thou mighteſt imagine mee dull, and of very ſilly courage, if, in ſteed of ſo good occaſion, as I haue to hate thee, I ſhoulde ſhewe my ſelfe thankefull for ſo many iniuries as thou haſt done mee.
                  Thou haſt highly pleaſed me, anſwered Amadis, in not diſguiſing thy venemous malice towards mee, and I deſerue no blame for thy deliuerance: for I was reſolued, a long while, to kept thee thus mued vp, as thinking it very reaſonable, to make theee ſuffer the paine iuſtly due to thee, rather then by releaſing thee, thou ſhouldeſt torment good people, as heretofore thou haſt done. Neuertheleſſe, ſince I promiſed thy freedome to thy wife, I will ſend thee hence, and cauſe thee to bee conuayed to ſome place of ſafety: deſiring thee (ſo much as is poſſible for mee to doe) that although, neither in will nor word, thou canſt finde in thy heart to pardon me; yet thou wouldeſt not treacherouſly beguile me. At leaſtwiſe, doe not hereafter vſe thy wonted cruelties, to ſuch as neuer did offer thee any diſpleaſure: which the rather thou oughteſt to doe, for his ſake, that hath beſtowed this inſtant fauour on thee, & gaue thee releaſe, when thou didſt leaſt looke for it. I know well enough replied Archalaus, that in any thing concerning thee, I ſhal exerciſethe 
                        •
                     ery beſt of my wil and skill, by all meanes poſſible I may, continually to work thee miſchiefe: but for harming others, perhappes (therein) I will followe thy counſell.
                  Wonderfully were all the Ladies amazed, to heare the olde villaine ſpeake ſo ſawcily to Amadis, and much they did reproue him for it, but tolde them: It was naturally his humour to be obſtinate, & they muſt endure it ſo wel as they could; but for the reſt hee would be ſure to keep promiſe with them.
                  So they departed out of the Chamber, leauing the wife of Archalaus there to keepe him companie till the next morning, and then Amadis ſent for Yſanio, commanding him, to releaſe Archalaus out of his iron Cage, to giue him horſe and Armour, and guide both him and his, farre from the limittes of the Encloſed Iſle, and with ſuch ſafety, as his wife might receiue no diſcontentment. Yſanio performed his charge, bringing him and his company ſo farre as his Caſtle of Valderine: where, taking leaue of him, Archalaus returned him many thankes, ſaying. Sir, tell Amadis from me, it belongs only to cruell and ſauage beaſts, to be mewed vp in Cages of iron, as I all this while haue beene, and not to Knights, ſuch as hee knowes I am. But bid him beware of mee, I hope very ſpeedily to be reuenged on him, euen in deſpight of that olde whore Vrganda the Vnknowne, in whom he repoſeth too much truſt. I rather thinke anſwered Yſanio, that I muſt take paines againe to keep you faſt, ſo long as already I haue done in your Cage.
                  With theſe words they parted, Yſanio and his traine returning the ſame way they came, euen till they ariued at the Encloſed Iſle: and thither

(ſooner after) came Darioletta, with her companie, being all moſt kindly entertayned. But now wee muſt alter our preſent diſcourſe, to tell you what Balan did, after that Amadis and Graſandor had left him, in the Iſland of the Red Tower.
                  
                  About fifteene dayes, or three weekes, after the two Knights of the Encloſed Iſle, were diſlodged frō the Red Tower; the Giant Balan, finding his wounds almoſt cured, and he able to walke about his Chamber, forthwith gaue order, that Dariolettaes Shippe ſhould be made readie, becauſe ſhee and all her companie might ſafely ſayle to the Encloſed Iſle, with Brauor his Sonne. Manie goodly Iewells and gifts he beſtowed on them, and being earlie embarqued on a Munday morning, they ſet ſayle and away, and landed as you haue already heard. The Giant being returned to his Caſtle, gaue preſently charge, to leuy and muſter men in all parts of his dominions, for the ſuccour of Agraies, who ſtill held the Citty of Arauigne beſiged, and long he delayed not, but all things were prepared, his ſhips well munited, and put forth to Sea.
                  So furtherous was both the wind and weather, that on the tenth day following, they landed where the Armie of the Encloſed Iſles Knights were encamped. No ſooner were Galaor and Galuanes Agrates, and the reſt aduertiſed thereof, and that Balan himſelfe was come on ſhoare: but they mounted on horſe-backe, to goe meete and welcome him, with a worthie troupe attending on them, for they knew before, all that had paſſed between Amadis & him. As they came neere they embraced each other, and the firſt that ſtept to Balan, was Galuanes, of whom the Giant (not knowing him) demanded, if hee were Galaor, the brother to Amadis, whom he was very deſirous to ſee? No ſir (quoth hee) I am Galuanes your friend and kinſ-man, if ſo you pleaſe to accept mee. Ha, my Lord and Couſin ſaid Balan, I had not beene ſo tardy from your company, and my deare Coſin Madaſima alſo, but for your friend-ſhippe with him, who then was my moſt deadly enemie: yet now wee are become ſo good friends, that I loue you ſo much the more, and for his ſake.
                  Cloſe by him was Galaor, who preſenting himſelfe to Balan, bad him moſt louingly welcome. The Giant vnderſtanding what and who he was, did him very humble reuerence, ſaying. My Lord, I ſtand ſo engaged to your Noble brother, as no Gentleman in the world can bee more his, then I am, and yours likewiſe. And ſurely wonder muſt now ceaſe in mee, concerning the fame and renowne publiſhed of you both becauſe I neuer ſaw any man more truely reſemble him then (in all reſpects) you effectually doe. But to ſpeake truely, there is no other difference betweene yee: but that you are ſomewhat taller, and Lord Amadis a little more corpulent. By this time they were come to the Campe and his lodging appointed in the Tent of Galuanes: which was ſingulerly beautifull, and farre more rich then any of the reſt.

and, becauſe it waxed ſomewhat late, being alſo a priuate night of ſupper, all bad him good reſt except Galaor and Galuanes, who ſtayed ſtill to keepe him company.
                  On the morrow morning, Balan being deſirous to round the Cittie, to obſerue the beſt ſtrength thereof, and which place was fitteſt for breach, or entrance: Galaor and hee walked very early together, ſo couertly as they could. But when Balan had well conſidered the Bulwarkes all about, the platformes and Rampires, within the depth of the ditches, and (aboue all elſe) what number of men were to defend it, with their ſtore of victuals, and neceſſary munition; it appeared a Citty to him, very hardly to be enforced. But then Galaor told him, that the moſt part of the Souldiers were bandied againſt the inhabitants, and the inhabitants againſt them: Whereby (quoth hee) this diſcord is ſufficient for their ruine vtterly. Conſidering withall, that (as wee haue receiued aduertiſement) their hearts are ſo deiected, as they dare make no more ſallies forth vpon vs, in regard of the great loſſes they haue had already. More-ouer, our men are reſolued to die in the aſſault, or they will enter: notwithſtanding, wee will not permit them to haue ſo much head, fearing their loſſe, and reſpecting our hope (day by day) of their ſurrender, the reaſons before alleaged conſidered, and our detayning their King here priſoner with vs alſo. Beleeue mee Sir, ſaid Balan, you ſtand vpon very great apparances, neuertheleſſe, if my aduiſe were worthy to be allowed, I would giue them no longer time of reſpite: But attempt our fortune to morrow morning, and ſee what lookes they will ſet vpon vs, in a bolde ſudden and ſprightlie aſſault.
                  So long laſted this diſcourſe, as it brought them to the Campe of Agraies, where meeting with Enill he ſaluted Balan, ſaying. My Lord, the Prince Agraies, entreates you, (being 
                        •
                     n this forwardneſſe) that you would ſee the King Arauigne, here priſoner in my Tent: becauſe hee is deſirous to ſpeake with you, as hee hath made knowne to the Prince. I am well contented anſwered Balan, for (perhaps) this comming of mine, may promiſe ſome good agreement with him. So they went all three to the King Arauigne, whom they found attended with his guard: But ſo ſoone as Balan, ſaw him, he ſet his knee to the ground, and kiſſed his hand. The King tooke him vp, ſaying: he was moſt heartily welcome. And becauſe they would conferre priuately on their affaires, the others left them alone, and departed thence.
                  Then King Arauigne demanded of him, what hee conceiued of his hard Fortune? And breathing forth a ſigh, ſufficient to haue broken a bigger heart: hee ſtood along while ſilent, as being vnable to deliuer a word, till at laſt, thus he ſpake. Ah my deare friend Balan, if your Father Mandafabull were now liuing, how Irkeſome would my miſhap be to him? And to ſpeake truely, matters are mightilie altered ſince his death. For, it is not fully a yeare, ſince I ſtood vpon no meane tearms of being the very greateſt King in all the Weſt: but now, I am beecome the pooreſt and moſt miſerable man in all the World. How Sir? replied Balan, it ſeemes you diſtruſt the mercy of the almighty in whoſe power it is, to diſpoſe of you as beſt liketh him. If Fortune haue once frowned on you, is her wheele ſo

faſt nayled or printed, as ſhee cannot lift you to the place from whence you are fallen? Let me perſwade you Sir, not to bee thus diſcomforted, but in kingly patience to thanke God for all, and hee will not forget you.
                  Walking on along with him, hee beganne thus againe. I knowe very well Sir, that hardly can you expreſſe conſtancie or courage, in ſuch caſes of ſo ſharpe affliction, and vneaſie to bee endured, as your impriſonement is. Yet I can deſire no better experience therein, then the like misfortune hath miniſtred to mee, in permitting mee to bee vanquiſhed by the ſame man, that was the worker of your downefall. Notwithſtanding, let mee take it ill or well, bee pleaſed or offended at my foyle: I ſee no other remedy, but only to arme my ſelfe with patience, and ſooner to forget the i
                        •
                     iurie I haue receiued, then my ſelfe. For the reſt, I am of opinion that it is poſſible, to treate on ſome good agreement betweene you and theſe Princes: who (I am perſwaded) will therein liſten to you, if ſuch a motion proceede from your ſelfe. How can that be done (quoth the King) except in forgoing all, which they pretend to haue conquered from me: and I had rather die, bearing the name of an impriſoned King, then to liue a begger at libertie.
                  If after death, ſaide Balan, life were eaſie to bee recalled backe againe, I ſhould ioyne with you in this opinion: but hauing nothing dearer to vs in this worlde, wee ſhould preſerue it ſo long as is poſſible for vs. My worthy friend Balan replied the the King, doe with mee what you pleaſe, into your hands I commit my ſelfe, my life, my goods, & honour: beſeeching you intirely, to remember my buſineſſe in ſuch nature, as I make no doubt but you will. Now becauſe they ſaw Enill comming in to them: they altred their diſcourſe, and Balan taking leaue of him, went to finde Galuanes and Galaor, who ſtaied his returne in the Tent of Agraies.
                  
                  There hee declared, what ſpeeches had paſt between him and the King Arauigne. And in my minde, quoth he, conſidering the humor wherein I left him, I thinke it were good to make him ſome offer, giuing him ſome countrie of his own for a place of retirement, where hee may weare out the remainder of his dayes: and be contented to reſigne vp all the reſt. The whole company was well pleaſed heere-with, and highly allowed the aduiſe of Balan: for to ſpeake vnpartially, hee was one of the wiſeſt men, and as ſound in iudgement, as any where elſe was to be found. Wherupon they entreated him, to mediate this matter with Arauigne, committing all to his diſcretion: becauſe indeede, they themſelues were halfe tyred, and grew wearie of the warre.
                  On the next morning, hee went to the King Arauigne, and (among diuerſe others remonſtrances) told him, how at his requeſt, and only by his meanes, hee had ſo well preuailed with the Princes of the Army: that they were all contented, to leaue him parte of the Iſles of Landes, in full and intire ſoueraignty. Which liked him well, conſidering it was much better for him, to continue King of a little, then to be Lord of nothing. Hereupon the City was ſurrendred, and certaine Shippes and victuals were giuen him, for his retreate into the Iſle of Liconia: And the very ſame day,

                      wherupon, diſconſolate▪ & out of all hope, ſeeing the night ſtealing faſt vpon him, he returned backe to the Citie, and without ſpeaking to any perſon, entred into the Queenes chamber, reporting to her, in what manner King Liſuart had left him, and afterward, could heare no tyding of

him. Not a little amazed was the Queene, when ſhee heard of this ſtrange and vnexpected accident, which made her fall downe into a trance: but her Ladies and Gentle-women being at hande, cut her laces, and quickly recouered life in hir againe. Then ſending for King Arban, and Cendill de Ganote, ſhee told them all that the Kings Bowbearer had imparted to hir. But they fearing further to offend her ſeemed to make ſmal account of it, perſwading her, that the Forreſt being long and large, and very thickly ſet with huge Woodes: hee might there looſe himſelfe for a while, yet afterwardes returne well enough home. No, neuer, ſaid the Queen. His horſe to be found, and no news of him? what anſwere you to that? Madam, quoth King A
                           •
                        ban, it appeares very likely, that the trees and buſhes ſtanding ſo thick, as no meane hinderance to his ſport, hee therefore left his horſe.
                  Theſe words did ſomewhat comfort the Queene, but yet her opiniō went quite contrary to his ſaying, and therefore, making a ſhew of ſome other buſineſſe, they returned to their lodgings, to Arme them-ſelues, and aduiſing other Knights (there preſent) to follow them, they entred into queſt of the King. But all was in vaine, for they could heare no tidings of him: ſo remayned the Queene in ſadnes till the next morning, when Grumedan and Giontes (being returned from their voyage) came to ſee her. She demanded of them, if they had met with the king? No truely Madam, quoth they, neither did wee know of his loſſe, till ſome of the Citty acquainted them therewith, but we intend to follow in the ſearch of him. On my faith, ſaid ſhe, I finde my ſelfe in ſuch affliction of minde, as I muſt needes goe with you: for abiding heere alone, I ſhall die with extreamity of ſorrow. But if eyther wee can finde him, or heare any news of him, it will ſhorten my griefe: otherwiſe, it will be ſome eaſe to mee, to endure any toyle or trauell whatſoeuer, rather then deſolately continue here.
                  So ſhe ſent for two Palfrayes her ſelfe mounting vpon the one, and the wife to Brandoynas on the other riding on in queſt of the King, with the two knights. From place to place they trauailed, but they could heare no news at all, and on the third day following, they met with King Arban very penſiue, and his Horſe ſo wearie, as hardly was hee able to goe. Then the Queene aſked him, if hee had heard any thing of the King? Madam, quoth hee, euen as much as when I left you, only I ſtand in doubt, that he is ſurprized by ſome treaſon, and carried out of this countrie. Long agoe it is ſince I foreſaw and ſuſpected this accident, and if he would haue been ruled by mee, this had neuer happened to him. I euermore diſſwaded him, yea, with teares, and entire intreaties, neuer to wander ſo alone in doubtfull and deceiuing Forreſts where infinite vnlooked for daungers lie hid; but hee would neuer like my aduiſe.
                  As hee would haue proceeded on further, the Queene fell downe in a ſwound from her Horſe: But Grumedan ſuddenly alighting, tooke her vp in his Armes, and ſpeech ſoone after came to hir againe, when deliuering a very vehement ſigh, ſhee ſaid. Falſe and deceitfull Fortune, hope of the miſerable, and cruell enemy to the proſperous, haue I now any occaſion to ſpeake well of thee?

And if wee can heare no ſpeedy tidings of him, either in this country or elſe where: yet his captiuity in any priſon cannot be ſo ſtrong, but by the helpe of your Subiects, and fauour of your friends and kinſemen, he will be quickly thence deliuered. And therfore I beſeech you Madam, ſetting aſide theſe ſorrows, which threaten danger to you: you would round engirt your ſelfe with good Councell and comfort, to reach the height of that, which is much more needfull for you in this caſe.
                  The Queen liking this diſcourſe, yeelded to Grumedans aduiſe, and thereupon, purpoſed to ſend Brandoynas to Amadis, to let him vnderſtand the Kings loſſe, and in what extreamity ſhe her ſelfe was, by him ſhe ſent this Letter following.
                  
                     
                        The Letter from Queene Briſena, to Lord Amadis.
                        
                        
                           My Lord and Sonne, if heretofore the eſtate of King Liſuart your Father, hath beene defended and augmented by your meanes: a ſeaſon (better now then euer) preſents it ſelfe for your employment (conſidering the perill prepared for him) to keepe and preſerue all ſtill in perfect condition. For, ſome ſmall while ſince, by his enemies (as it appeareth moſt likely) he is carried away and impriſoned none of vs knowing where, or why: which makes mee beleeue, that but vpon occaſion of a farre greater enterpriſe, this Treaſon would neuer haue beene vndertaken. Now, becauſe it is a matter concerning you (next to my ſelfe) more then a

Wherefore I pray you to credit him as my ſelfe, and conſider on the reſt.
                        
                        
                           Your wofull Mother Queene Briſena.
                        
                     
                  
                  This Letter written and deliuered to Brandoynas, he ſet on towards Amadis: and the Queene with her company, went directly to London to call a councell, and ſet all things in order. Here you are to vnderſtand, that ſoone after the romor of the Kings loſſe, ſpre
                        •
                     d it ſelfe ſo liberally in all places: that Quedragant, Bruneo and the reſt, being then in Sanſuegua, had intelligence there-of, and they honorably conſidering what preiudice might redound therby to Amadis, if any neede ſhould happen in Great Brittaine: concluded on the ſpeedy goeing to the Encloſed Iſle, to vndertake whatſoeuer hee ſhould command them. Here-upon, hauing planted Gariſons in all needefull places, they ſayled thence with ſo faire a winde: that they landed at the Pallace of Apolidon, the very ſame day as Brandoynas arriued there.
                  As Amadis was comforting Oriana, by reaſon of the news formerly receiued; the comming of theſe Knightes was made known to him: but hee being loath to leaue the Princeſſe alone, intreated Graſandor to goe meete them, and acquaint them with the occaſion of his ſtaying behinde, which accordingly he performed, finding them in good forwardneſſe on the way. Then he declared to them, what hee had receiued in charge from Amadis, deſiring them to excuſe him, if this day did not alow them to ſee him: but early the next morning hee intended

to viſite them. Now, becauſe the affaires they came about, required ſome ſpeed & dilligence, they entred into Councell, and Brandoynas was called before them all: where amply he declared, what he could ſay concerning the Kings loſſe, and in what dangerous condition hee had left the Quene. Many opinions paſſed among them, but at length it was reſolued: that they all ſhould purſue the queſt of him, both by Sea and Land, hoping Fortune would be no leſſe fauourable to them herein, then heereto-fore ſhee had beene in the like attempts.
                  Scarcely had they concluded on this deliberation, but one of their Squires came and tolde them, that a Ladie was come forth of the great Serpent, and (in their opinion) it was Vrgania the Vnknowen. If it be ſhee ſaid Amadis, then the caſe will goe well with vs. So they all ſet forwarde, and met her (almoſt) at the Parkes entrance, mounted on a goodly Palfrey, which her two Dwarffes led by the bridle reines. The firſt ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe vnto, was Galaor, whom ſhee kindly ſaluted, and all the reſt, and being in the midſt among them, ſhe thus began. How now Lords? did not I lately tell you, that I ſhould finde you heere againe aſſembled in this place, about ſome buſineſſe then vnknowne to you? You did Madame, anſwered Galaor, I remember it very well, ſo doth Madame Oriana likewiſe, who wil not be a little ioyfull for your ariuall. And partly to comfort her (quoth ſhee) is the cauſe of my now comming.
                  So they entred into the Pallace, and being diſmounted from horſe-backe, they conducted her to the chamber of the Princeſſe; who ſo ſoone as ſhee ſawe her, ca
                        •
                     e and fell at her feet, and weeping inceſſantly, ſaid. Alas madame, you that knowe future accidents, as well as them preſent, why did you not take order, for the King my fathers miſ-fortune, hee beeing your ſo dearely eſteemed friend? I may well aſſure my ſelfe, that when you fayle him, his caſe is vtterly voide of any remedie.
                  Madame, anſwered Vrganda, I pray you doe not thus diſcomfort your ſelfe. Know you not, that the more men are mounted to high degrees, the more ſubject they are to as great tribulations? Although wee are all made of one and the ſame ſubſtance, all obliged to vices and paſſions, yea equall alike to death: yet the omnipotent Lord of all, hath made vs diuerſe, in enioying the goods of this world. To ſome hee giues authority; others are ſubiect to ſeruility and vaſſalage. Some are made poore and very miſerable, others enioy aboundance and proſperity, and all according to his owne good pleaſure. So worthy Madame, comparing the great bleſſing, you now enioy, with ſuch ſorrowes and vexations as you haue ſuſtained, put all your preſent af
                        •
                     ictions into one ſeale, and your paſſed fortunes into another, and they will no way be anſwerable in weight. As for the King your father, I knewe (long agoe) this which hath happened to him, and yet notwithſtanding, I could not help it. For ſo it was appointed by diuine pre-ſcience, who (in time) will alſo permit: that he ſhall returne home againe into his owne countrey, with as much contentment, as euer heretofore hee enioyed.
                  Then conuerting her ſpeeches to Amadis, & others there preſent, thus ſhee proceeded. When I departed

laſt from his companie, I did then aſſure yee, that at ſuch time as Eſplandian ſhould receiue his order of Knight-hood, I would meete you againe in this place, for this cauſe, to keepe promiſe both with you, and him, and to diſcharge you of a labour you are entring into: I am come hither as you ſee. And this I tell you, that if all the men this day liuing, and ſo many more as ſhall come hereafter, doe attempt the queſt of king Liſuart, and to deliuer him out of the place where hee is: they looſe all their paines. Therefore let mee aduiſe you to deſiſt from the promiſe you haue made each to other. Requeſting you beſide, that you will all be my gueſts in the great Serpent, with Eſplandian, Telanque, Manelie, the King of Dacia, and Ambor, Sonne to Angriote, preſently giuing order for your Horſes, for the houre now inuites vs.
                  They not daring to denie her, did as ſhee commanded, and giuing good reſt to Oriana, accompanied her to the Sea ſide: where they found a Barque ready, which conueied them to the place where the great Serpent lay. Entring thereinto they left their horſes in the great Hall, where taking Eſplandian and his companions with her, ſhee led them into a Chappell, to performe their watch and prayer, according to the ancient cuſtome, before any man might be made a Knight. Afterward ſhe returned againe to the reſt, and bad them ſit downe to ſupper, which they found ready prepared for them, and in moſt royall manner. The tables being with-drawne, ſhe ſent them to keep company with them that watched in the Chappell. Then ſhee and her two kinſewomen, Soliſa and her Siſter, followed them, Vrganda carrying a Habbit or Coate of Male, very black, Saliſa an Helmet, of the ſame colour, and the third a ſhield anſwerable thereto.
                  Now, albeit (at the beginning) all other Knightes were armed with white Armour: yet would ſhee needs haue him to differ from them in this manner. So ſoone as ſhee was entred the Chappell, ſhee called Eſplandian to her, ſaying. Moſt happy yong Gentleman, ſee what accoutraments I haue brought for you, as teſtimonies of the power, wherewith your heart will hereafter bee enueloped, partaking (in ſome meaſure) with the naturall diſpoſition of the king your grand-father. Moreouer, it is to put you in minde, that as other (when they are made Knights) receiue this honor with white Armour, and brightly poliſhed, in ſigne of ioy and cheerefulneſſe: ſo theſe thus black and vnſightly, are beſtowed on you by deſtinie, to remember you (many times) of thoſe ſorrows and tribulations, wherein all your friends are at this preſent. So they three armed him from head to foote, only his Sword excepted, and demanded of Amadis his opinion therein. By my faith Madam, quoth he, if he had a Sword, hee were in caſe (me thinkes) both to defend himſelfe, and to aſſayle any other.
                  You know anſwered Vrganda, as well, or better then any other in this troup, where one hath been kept for him aboue two hundred years paſt and you haue ſeene it in the Rock of the Damoſell Enchauntreſſe who left it there (by apointment of the fates) only for him. And therefore hee muſt needes goe thither to conquer it, for I dare aſſure you, hee will performe ſuch actions of arms, as ſhall eclipſe the bright fames of many that haue ſhined moſt cleerely

in all partes of the worlde. As ſhee ſpake theſe wordes, foure other Damoſells came in, each one bringing furniture for a horſe, and an Armour as white as ſnow, hauing a blacke croſſe in the midſt thereof, and theſe foure other Damoſells armed him therewith. All this while, was Eſplandian on his knees, before the Altar deuoutly imploring the aſſiſtance of heauen, to giue him grace and meanes, wherby to accompliſh thoſe things deſtined to him: as well for the deliuerance of King Liſuart, as any other enterpriſe whatſoeuer, wherein hee coueted not his owne priuate glory.
                  Thus remained the Knights all night in prayer, euen vntill the next morning, when a miſhapen ill fauoured Dwarffe, beeing mounted on the very height of the ſerpent, winding a Cornet with ſuch loudnes, as the whole Iſland returned the Eccho therof from all parts: & the Ladies ranne vp to the Towers in the Pallace of Apolidon, to ſee and obſerue whence this noyſe came. Then went Vrganda from the Chapell, with them that had watched all night whom ſhe conducted vp near to the Dwarffe: And inwardly came ſixe other Damoſels, attired all in blacke, each bearing a Trumpet of golde in her hand: and Vrganda calling Balan to her, ſaide. Friend Balan euen as nature hath preferred you before all other of your linage, making you an enemy to vice, to follow reaſon and vertue, ſo will I aduaunce you (for the loue I know Amadis beares you, and euery other Knight in this company) and doe you ſuch an honour this day, as all that haue beene before you, or are liuing at this preſent, could not, nor can attaine to the like. And this it is, that Eſplandian (who ſhall be eſteemed the beſt Knight in the worlde) muſt haue his order of Knighthood from your hand.
                  
                     Balan fearing to diſpleaſe Amadis and the reſt, excuſed himſelfe very honourably: but they all preuailing with him, hee tooke Eſplandian by the hand, and asked him if hee would bee a Knight? Yes Sir, quoth 
                        •
                     ee, if you pleaſe to beſtow ſuch honour on mee. Then Balan gaue him the accolade, and after-warde, buckled on his right ſpurre, ſaying: I pray God (faire Gentle-man) to make thee ſuch a man, as generall hope is conceiued of thee. This done, Vrganda tooke Amadis aſide, ſaying. Bethinke your ſelfe, if you will haue any thing with your ſonne, becauſe hee is to departe hence ſuddenly. Hereupon, Amadis rounding him in the eare, ſaying. My ſonne, at ſuch time as I ariued in Greece, I was receiued, and highly honoured by the Emperour, who afterwardes lent mee ſo good aſſiſtance, as I muſt confeſſe my ſelfe for euer beholding to him. And becauſe hee tyed mee to ſome promiſes, made then (vnder mine oath) to his faire daughter Leonoryna, one of the moſt wiſe and gracious Princeſſes in the worlde, as alſo to the Queene Menoreſſa, & other Ladies in her companie: that if I could nor returne againe to them my ſelfe, I ſhould ſend them a Knight of my linage, to ſerue them. I finde my ſelfe in no diſpoſition leaning that way, but command you, that ſo ſoone as you haue releaſed King Liſuart, you goe and diſcharge my dutie to her. And that you may be the better knowne, receiue this Ring, which was giuen me there for a kind token.
                  
                     
                     Eſplandian humbly vpon his knee promiſed, not to faile a iote herein: but it was not fulfilled ſo ſoone as they both hoped for, becauſe before hee came thither, hee paſſed through many perills for the loue of that faire Lady, whoſe renowne only (hauing neuer ſeene her, tied him ſo ſubiect to hir, as hee made no valuation of his Life, as when it comes more aptly to our purpoſe, you ſhall further vnderſtand. Then Vrganda called him, ſaying. Sonne you muſt needes beſtowe Knight-hood of theſe your foure companions, who, before many dayes are paſt, may render you the honour of your gift. Eſplandian obeying the will of Vrganda, gaue them the embrace, and ſpurre on their heeles, and then the ſixe Damoſells ſounded their Trumpets ſo ſweetely: As all the Lords and the fiue new made Knights likewiſe became ſo ſleepilie en

Learne now to taſt thoſe ſweets and ſowres, which Kinges and Rulers are Subiect vnto, for they are now prouided for thee.

                  Hauing all of them read this Letter, they entred into a conteſtation, whether they ſhould follow the Counſell of Vrganda, or no: But at length Amadis tolde them, that it was behouefull to credit her, in regard of the continuall truth of her predictions. And therefore (quoth hee to Galaor) I take it for the beſt, that you and Galuanes ſhould goe to Great Brittaine, to viſit the queene, and let her know what Vrganda hath propoſed vs, for the Kinges

deliuerance, which will be no little ioy to her, and ſo ſoone as you returne mee anſwere, my Coſen Agraies, Balan and I will followe after you.
