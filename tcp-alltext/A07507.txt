               Pray heauen it be no fault,
               For there's as much diſeaſe, though not to th' eye,
               In too much pittie, as in Tyrannie.

               (For none of his ſad counſell has a voyce in't)
               Should ſo farre trauaile into his conſent,

               I can, & indeed a Prince need no trauaile farther then his owne Kingdome, if hee applie himſelfe faythfullye, worthie the glorie of himſelfe and expectation of others: and it would appeare farre nobler induſtrie in him, to reforme thoſe faſhions that are alreadye in his Countrey, then to bring newe ones in, which haue neither true forme nor faſhion; to make his Court an Owle, Cittie an Ape, and the Countrey a Wolfe, preying vpon the ridiculous pride of eyther, and therefore I holde it a ſafer ſterne vpon this luckie aduantage, ſince my father is nere his ſetting, and I vpon the Eaſterne hil to take my riſe, to look into the heart & bowels of this Dukedome, and in diſguiſe, marke all abuſes readie for Reformation or Puniſhment.

               Phoen.
               So much haue the complaints and ſuits of men, ſeauen, nay ſeauenteene yeares neglected, ſtil interpoſd by coine and great enemies, preuaild with my pittie, that

I cannot otherwiſe thinke but there are infectious dealings in moſt offices, and foule miſteries throughout al Profeſſions: and therefore I nothing doubt but to find trauaile ynough within my ſelfe, and Experience I fear too much: nor will I be curious to fit my bodie to the humbleſt forme and bearing, ſo the labor may be fruitfull: for how can abuſes that keepe lowe, come to the right view of a Prince, vnleſſe his lookes lie leuell with them, which elſe will be longeſt hid from him, hee ſhall be the laſt man ſees 'em.
               For oft betwene Kings Eyes, and ſubiects Crimes
               Stands there a barre of brybes, the vnder office
               Flatters him next aboue it: he the next,
               And ſo of moſt, or manye, Euerie Abuſe will chuſe a brother,
               Tis through the world, this Hand will rub the other.

               Falſ.
               No by my faith: you ſhall not haue me in that Trap: am I ſworne Iuſtice of Peace, and ſhall I giue my warrant to fetch a man againſt his will? why there the peace is Broken, wee muſt doe all quietly, if hee come hee's welcome, and as far as I can ſeeyet, hees a foole to bee abſent, I by this golde is hee (which hee gaue me this morning)

                     Ʋina Voce, with his owne mouth deliuer that contempt, that

that he would not appeare, or did you but ieſtint?

               Draw me a ſtrong limbd warrant for the Gentleman ſpeedily, he will be bountifull to thee: goe and thanke him within.

               Falſ.
               I, I prethee doe. Two Angels one partie, foure another: and I thinke it a great ſparke of wiſdome and policie (if a man come to me for Iuſtice) firſt to knowe his greefes by his fees, which bee light and which bee he

               How ſir?
            
            
               Furt.
               Newly deceaſd I can aſſure your Worſhip: the Tabacco-pipe new dropt out of his mouth before I tooke horſe, a ſhrewd ſigne: I knew then there was no way but one with him, the poore pipe was the laſt man he took leaue off in this world, who ſel in three peeces before him, & ſeem'd to mourne inwardly, for it lookt as blacke'th mouth as my maiſter.

               Would hee die ſo like a Polititian, & not once write his minde to me?
            
            
               Fur.
               No Ile ſay that for him ſir: he dyed in the perfect ſtate of memorie, made your worſhip his ful and whole executor: bequeathing his Daughter, and with her all

his wealth, onely to your diſpoſition.
            
            
               Falſ.
               Did he make ſuch a godly end ſaiſt thou? did he die ſo comfortably, and bequeath all to me?

               What a precious ioy and comfort's this, that a Iuſtices brother can die ſo wel, nay in ſuch a good and happie memorie, to make me full executor. Wel he was too honeſt to liue, and that made him die ſo ſoone: now I beſhrew my heart, I am glad hee's in heauen, has left all his cares and troubles with me, and that great vexation of telling of Money, yet I hope hee had ſo much grace before he died to turn his white mony into gold, a great eaſe to his Executor.

               Ah my ſweete Neece, let me kiſſe thee, & drop a teare betweene thy lips: one teare from an old man is a great matter, the cockes of age are drie, thou haſt loſt a vertuous father, to gaine a notable vncle.

wholy and ſoly mine owne: and ſince you are ſo fortunately come Neece, Ile reſt a perpetuall widower.
            
            
               Neece.
               I take the meaning chaſter then the words:

               I make my brother (ſaies he) full and whole Executor, honeſtly done of him yfaith, ſeldome can a man get ſuch a brother: and here again ſaies he, very vertuouſly, I bequeath all to him and his diſpoſing: an excellent fellow a my troth, would you might all die no worſe, Gentlemen.

               As far as I can perceiue yet by you,

               Do you ſo far forget the Offices

               Falſ.
               What are become of the other two, Latronello, and Fuca?
            
            
               Latro.
               Heere ſir.
            
            
               Phoe.
               They both made away from vs, the crie purſues e'm, but as yet none but this taken.
            
            
               Falſ.
               
                  Latronello.
               
            
            
               Latron.
               Sir.

               Yes ſir.
            
            
               Falſ.
               Let the Knaue ſtand ſingle.
            
            
               Furt.
               Thanke your good worſhip.
            
            
               Falſ.
               Ha's beene a ſuter at Court ſure, hee thankes me for nothing.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Hee's a Theefe now ſure.
            
            
               Falſ.
               That we muſt know of him, what are you ſir?
            
            
               Furt.
               A peece next to the Taile ſir—a Seruingman.
            
            
               Falſ.
               By my troth a prettie phraſe and verye

cleanly handled, put it downe Latronello: thou mayſt make vſe on't. Is hee of honour or worſhip whom thou ſerueſt?
            
            
               Fur.
               Of both deere ſir, honourable in minde, and worſhipfull in bodie.
            
            
               Falſ.
               Why would one wiſh a man to ſpeake better?
            
            
               Phoen
               Oh ſir, they moſt commonly ſpeake beſt, that doe worſt.
            
            
               Falſ.
               Say you ſo ſir, then weele trie him farther, — Do's your right worſhipfull maiſter, goe before you, as an enſample of Vice, and ſo encourage you to this ſlinking iniquitie? hee is not a Lawer, is he?
            
            
               Furt.
               Ha's the more wrong ſir, both for his conſcience, and honeſtie, he deſerues to be one.
            
            
               Fal.
               Pittie hee's theefe yfaith, I ſhould entertaine him elſe.
            
            
               Phoen.
               I, if he were not as he is, hee would be better then himſelfe.
            
            
               Furt.
               No tis well knowne ſir, I haue a maiſter, the verie picture of wiſdome,
            
            
               Lat.
               For indeed he ſpeakes not one wiſe worde.
            
            
               Furt.
               And no man but will admire to heare of his Vertues.
            
            
               Lat.
               Becauſe he nere had any in all his life.
            
            
               Falſ.
               You write all downe Latronello.
            
            
               Latr.
               I warrant you ſir.
            
            
               Furt.
               So ſober, ſo diſcrete, ſo iudicious:
            
            
               Falſ.
               Hum.
            
            
               Furt.
               And aboue all, of moſt reuerend grauitie.
            
            
               Falſ.
               I like him for one qualitie, hee ſpeakes well of his maiſter, he will fare the better:—Now ſir, let mee touch you,
            
            
               Fur.
               I ſir.
            
            
               Falſ.
               Why, ſeruing a Gentleman of ſuch worſhip and wiſdome, ſuch ſobrietie and vertue, ſuch diſcretion and iudgement as your maſter is, doe you take ſuch a beaſtly

courſe, to ſtop horſes, hinder Gentlewomen from their meetings, and make Citizens neuer ride but a Sundaies, onely to auoyd Morning praier and you: is it becauſe your worſhipfull Ma. feeds you with leane ſpits, paies you with Iriſh mony, or clothes you in northern dozēs?
            
            
               Furt.
               Farre be it from his mind, or my report, Tis well knowne he kept worſhipful cheer the day of his wiues burial, payes our foure marks a yeare as duly by twelue pence a quarter as can be.
            
            
               Phoe.
               His wiſdome ſwallowes it.
            
            
               Furt.
               And for Northren dozens, fie, fie, wee were nere troubled with ſo many.
            
            
               Falſ.
               Receiuing then ſuch plenteous bleſſings from your vertuous and bountiful maſter, what cauſe haue you to be theefe now? anſwer me to that geere:
            
            
               Furt.
               Tis ee'n as a man giues his mind too't ſir.
            
            
               Falſ.
               How ſir?
            
            
               Furt.
               For alas, if the whole worlde were but of one trade; traffique were nothing: if wee were all truemen, wee ſhould bee of no trade: what a pittifull world would heere bee, heauen forbid we ſhould bee all truemen: then howe ſhould your worſhips next ſuite bee made? not a Tayler left in the lande: of what ſtuffe would you haue it made? not a Merchant left to deliuer it, would your worſhip goe in that ſute ſtill? You would ha more theeues about you then thoſe you haue baniſht, and be glad to call the great ones home agen, to deſtroy the little.
            
            
               Phoe.
               A notable Rogue.
            
            
               Fal.
               A my troth, a fine knaue, & ha's anſwered me gloriouſly, what wages wilt thou take after thou art hāg'd?
            
            
               Furt.
               More then your worſhip's able to giue, I would thinke foule ſcorne to be a Iuſtice then.
            
            
               Fal.
               He ſayes true too yfayth, for we are all full of corruption here,—hearke you my friends.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Sir.
            
            
               
               Fal.
               By my troth if you were no crueller then I, I could find in my hart to let him goe.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Could you ſo ſir, the more pittiful Iuſtice you.
            
            
               Fal.
               Nay I did but to trie you, if you haue no pittie, Ile ha none, away hee's a Theefe, to priſon with him.
            
            
               Furt.
               I am content ſir.
            
            
               Fal.
               Are you content, bring him backe, nay then you ſhall not goe.
            
            
               Fal.
               Ile be as cruel as you can wiſh: y'are content, belike you haue a tricke to breake priſon, or a bribe for the Officers.
            
            
               Conſt.
               For vs ſir?
            
            
               Fal.
               For you ſir? what colour's ſiluer I pray, you nere ſaw mony in your life:—Ile not truſt you with him, Latronello and Fucato, lay hold vpon him, to your charge I commit him.
            
            
               Furt.
               Oh, I beſeech you ſir.
            
            
               Fal.
               Nay if I muſt be cruell, I will be cruell.
            
            
               Furt.
               Good ſir, let me rather goe to priſon.
            
            
               Fal.
               You deſire that▪—Ile truſt no priſon with you, Ile make you lye in mine own houſe, or Ile know why I ſhal not.
            
            
               Furt.
               Mercifull ſir.
            
            
               Falſ.
               Since you haue no pittie I will be cruell.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Verie good ſir, you pleaſe vs well.

               Fal.
               You ſhall be hang'd out a'th way, away with him Latronello, and Fucato,—Officers I diſcharge you my houſe, I like not your companie.
               Report me as you ſee me, fire and fuell,
               If men be Iewes, Iuſtices muſt be cruell.
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Phoe.
               So ſir, Extreames ſet of all Actions thus,

               He being bent to furie, I doubt now

               Is that ſhee?
            
            
               Fid.
               This is ſhe my Lord.

               A modeſt preſence.

               Vertue bleſſe you Ladie,

               I'de firſt in charge this kiſſe, and next this paper,
               You'le know the language, tis Fidelios.
            
            
               Neece.
               My euer vowed loue, how is his health?
            
            
               Fid.
               As faire as is his fauour with the Prince.
            
            
               Nee.
               I'me ſick with ioy, do's the Prince loue him ſo?
            
            
               Fid.
               His life cannot requite it,
               Not to wrong the remembrance of his loue,
               I had a token for you, kept it ſafe,
               Till by misfortune of the way this morning,
               Theeues ſet vpon this Gentleman and my ſelfe,
               And with the reſt robd that.
            
            
               Neece.
               Oh me, I'me deerly ſorie for your chance, was it your loſſe?
               They boldly looke you in the face that rob'd you,
               No farther villaines then my vncles men.
            
            
               Phoen.
               What Ladie?
            
            
               Neece.
               Tis my griefe I ſpeake ſo true.
            
            
               Fid.
               Why my Lord?
            
            
               Phoen.
               But giue me pawſing Lady: was hee one that tooke the examination?
            
            
               Neece.
               One and the chiefe.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Hence-forth hang him that is no way a theefe,
               Then I hope few will ſuffer,—nay all the ieſt was, hee committed him to the charge of his fellowes, and the rogue made it lamentable, cryed to leaue'em.
               None liue ſo wiſe but fooles may once deceiue em?
            
            
               Fid.
               An vncle ſo inſaciate?
            
            
               
               Phoen.
               I, Iſt not ſtrange too,
               That al ſhould be by Nature vicious, and he bad againſt
               Nature?
            
            
               Neece.
               Then you haue heard the ſum of al my wrongs.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Lady, we haue, and deſire rather now
               To heale 'em, then to heare 'em:
               For by a letter from Fidelio
               Direct to vs, we are entreated ioyntly,
               To haſten your remoue▪ from this foule den,
               Of theft and purpos'd inceſt:
            
            
               Neece.
               I reioyce in his chaſt care of mee, Ile ſoone bee furniſht.
            
            
               Fid.
               He writes that his returne cannot be long.
            
            
               Neece.
               I'me chiefly glad,—but whither is the place?
            
            
               Phoen.
               To the ſafe ſeate of his late wronged mother.

               His pleaſure was vexation, all his bliſſe
               The torment of another.
               Their heart, his health: their ſtarued hopes his ſtore,
               Who ſo loues Law, dies either mad or poore.

               Oh, ile giue him the table too firſt. Better indure a fiſt then a ſharpe ſword: I had rather they ſhould pull off my cloathes then flea of my skin, and hang that on mine enemies hedge.
            
            
               Phoe.

               True, and in it ſelfe tis glorious and deuine,

               Where art thou, O my Knight!
            
            
               
               
                  Phoe:
               Your Knight, I am the Dukes knight.
            
            
               Iew.

               Now out vpon the Marmoſet, haſt thou ſeru'd me ſo long, and offer to bring in a Candle?
            
            
               
                  Phoe:
               Faire Roome, villanous face, and worſe woman, I ha learnt ſomething by a glimpſe ath Candle:
            
            
               Iew.
               How hapned it you came ſo ſoone, I lookt not for you theſe two howers: yet as the ſweete chance is, you came as well as a thing coulde come, for my huſ: band's newly brought a bed.
            
            
               Phoe.
               And what ha's Ioue ſent him?
            
            
               Iew.
               Hee nere ſent him any thing ſince I knewe him, hee's a man of a bad nature to his wife, none but his Maides can thriue vnder him.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Out vpon him.
            
            
               Iew.
               I, iudge whether I haue a cauſe to be a Curtezan or no? to doe as I doe, an elderly fellow as hee is, if hee were marryed to a young Virgin, hee were able to breake her heart, tho he could breake nothing elſe: here, here, there's iuſt a hundred and fiftie, but I ſtole e'm ſo hardlye from him, twold ee'ne haue grieud you to haue ſeene it.
            
            
               Phoe
               So twould yfaith.
            
            
               Iew.
               Therefore prethee my ſweete pleaſure, doe not keepe company ſo much, how doe you thinke I am able to maintaine you? though I bee a Iewellers wife, Iewells are like women, they riſe & fal, we muſt be content to looſe ſometimes, to gaine often, but you'r content alwaies to looſe, and neuer to gaine: what need you ride with a Footeman before you?
            
            
               Phoe:
               Oh thats the grace,
            
            
               Iewe.
               The grace? tis ſufficient grace that y'aue a Horſe to ride vpon, you ſhould thinke thus with your ſelfe euery time you goe to bed if my head were laide, what would become of that horſe? he would runne a bad race then as well as his Maiſter.
            
            
               
               Phoe.
               Nay, and you giue me money to chide me:—
            
            
               Iewel.
               No, if it were as much more, I would thinke it foule ſcorne to chide you, I aduiſe you to be thrifty, to take the time now, while you haue it, you ſhall ſildome get ſuch an other foole as I am, I warrant you: why there's Mettrezza Auriola keepes her loue with halfe the coſt that I am at, her friend can goe a foote like a good Husband, walke in woſted Stockings, and enquire for the Six-penny ordinarie.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Pox on't, and would you haue me ſo baſe?
            
            
               Iew.
               No, I would not haue you ſo baſe neither: but now and then, when you keep your Chamber, you might let your Footeman out for eighteen pence a day, a great releefe at yeares end I can tell you.
            
            
               Ph.
               The age muſt needs be foule when vice reformes it.
            
            
               Iew.
               Nay, I'ue a greater quarrell to you yet.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Yfaith, what iſt?
            
            
               Iewe.
               You made me beleeue at firſt the Prince had you in great eſtimation, and would not offer to Trauaile without you, nay, that he could not trauaile without your Direction and intelligence.
            
            
               Phoe.
               I'me ſorrie I ſaide ſo yfaith, but ſure I was ouerflowen when I ſpoke it, I could nere ha ſaide it elſe.
            
            
               Iew.
               Nay more, you ſwore to me, that you were the firſt that taught him to ride a greate horſe, and tread the Ring with agilitie.
            
            
               Phoe.
               By my troth I muſt needes confeſſe I ſwore a great lye in that, & I was a villain to doe it, for I could nere ride greate horſe in my life.
            
            
               Iewl.
               Why loe, who would loue you now but a Cittizens wife? so inconſtant, ſo for ſworne: you ſay women are falſe Creatures, but take away men, and thei'd bee honeſter then you—Nay laſt of all, which offends me moſte of all, you tolde me you covld countenance me at Court, and you knowe wee eſteeme a friend there, more

               Phoe.
               What I ſpake of that. Lady, ile maintaine.
            
            
               Iew:
               You maintaine? you ſeene it court?
            
            
               Phoe.
               Why by this Diamond—
            
            
               Iew.
               Oh take heede, you cannot haue that, tis alwaies in the eye of my huſband.
            
            
               Phoe.
               I proteſt I will not keepe it, but onely vſe it for th is vertue, as a token to fetch you,& approue my power, where you ſhall not onely ye bee receiued, but made knowne to the beſt and chiefeſt.
            
            
               Iewel.
               Oh are you true?
            
            
               Phoe.
