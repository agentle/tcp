            Conteyninge the whole discourse of the histories as well of this realme of England as al other coūtreys, with the succesion of their kinges, the time of their reigne, and what notable actes they did: much profitable to be redde, namelye of Magistrates, and such as haue auctoritee in commō weales, gathered out of most probable auctours. Firste by Thomas Lanquet, from the beginning of the worlde to the incarnacion of Christe, Secondely to the reigne of our soueraigne lord king Edward the sixt by Thomas Cooper, and thirdly to the reigne of our soueraigne Ladye Quene Elizabeth, by Robert Crowley.

            LONDINI, In aedibus Thomae Marshe.
         
         
            
            
            ¶ To the ryghte hyghe and myghtye Prynce, Edward by the grace of God, Duke of Somerset, gouernour of the kynges maiestees most royall person, and protectour of all his hyghnesse realmes dominions, and subiectes, Thomas Cooper wysheth all wealth and perfite felicitie.
            
               AL be it (righte excellente prince (your affabilltye and clemencie is such, and so great, that all people of euery state and degree, as well poore as riche, maye at all conueniente times haue free accesse to your grace, and haue their reasonable suites complayntes, and peticions benignely heard, and accordynge to equitee, iustice and good conscience depeched, so that therby it is verye likely that the true knowledge of the state and condicion of the weale publike, is at all tymes to your grace reueled & opened: Yet because (well nere) in all common weales, and aboute all suche noble and good princes, there haue ben some, which for their owne commoditee, aduancement, displeasure or other affection, haue so letted and hindered true report, that it could not frankly come foorthe, it is a thyng much to be feared, and with all wisedome and prudence to be foresene, lest any such might perchance hereafter couertly crepe in fauour, as by flatterye and dissimulacion, would endeuour to abuse your godly gentilnesse, as suche haue dooen the like natures of other most vertuous and worthie gouernours before tyme: and by that meanes not onely blemyshe greatly the immortal prayses that your grace shoulde moost woorthily deserue of all men, for your godly and politike gouernaunce, but also tourne

this noble realme to muche trouble and hindrance. For neuer did there chaunce greatter mischiefe to any comm
                  •
               n weale, neuer were the vertuous natures of greate rulers so soone corrupted, as either when they haue ben misinstructed and wronge infourmed by flatterers, or els when those that were in moste fauour and credyte, dissimu
                  •
               ing the trueth, in stede of equitee & iustice, haue wrought their owne purposes. Was not the good kyng Darius by wicked persuasiōs induced, euen against his conscience, to committe Daniel the prophete of god, to the daunger of the cruell and hungrie lions? had not the diuelish counsaile of Haman persuaded Assuerus without cause to destroy the whole nacion of the Iewes, for malice that he bare to Mardocheus, ne had the singuler prouydence of God in Hester preserued theim? to what misgouernaunce and vicious liuyng did Perennius, Cleander, & other bring the emperour Commodus, notwithstanding the graue and sage counsailours lefte hym by his father Marcus Antonius? did any thing so much corrupte the nature of the valiant conqueroure Alexander, and so greatly blemish his fame and glorye, as that he had his eares so open to flatterers? whiche made hym to thinke, that he was the sonne of their greate god Iupiter? yea almoste that he was a god and no mortall man. Wherfore the wyse emperour Gordian had good cause to saie, that he was a wretched prince, from whom v ertuous counsaile & the trueth of matters was hidde by flatery. Yea (& in mine opinion) it were farre more tollerable, that the soueraine were euyll him selfe, then that hys nere friendes, seruauntes, or famylyars, whome he trusteth, should bee flatterers, couetous, or malisyous. For suche persons shal not onely theim selfes dooe muche euyl, but also by false informacion, corruptinge the high ruler (if it be possible) allure hym to dooe the lyke, to the peryll and daunger bothe of hym selfe and of the weale publike. Therfore wisemen haue alwayes iudged them most worthie, to be extremely punished, to the example of al other, like as the noble emperour Alexander

for his sharpe iustice named Seuerus, caused Vetronnis Thurinus with smoke to be smuddered to death, because in matters of suite he had taken bribes for false reporte of the emperours fauour. For the noble gouernour suspecting no such eueil to be in them, (for how long wold it be, ere the wilie waies of such subtile re
                  •
               nardes maye be spyed out) may lightly be misledde and do the more 
                  •
               o he wold not, if he wist surely how the truth went. And this daunger hath alwayes bene so much the thynge be feared, as that witty men perceyuyng thinges to be in suchewise mishandled by theim that were in great fauour with their princes, durst not, or at the least wold not speake and discouer the greuous hurtes of the commen weale: some, for feare to be hindred by those familiars, & so to lose their dignitees, offices, & auctoritees: some for great hope that they had, to be by their reporte commended, and therby aduaunced to some promocion or high roome in the common weale. So that I gather hereby (righte excellente prince) that of all other it is a thinge mooste difficile and harde to rule well, and for a chiefe magistrate and gouernour to be truly and without dissimulacion informed in euerye case, as the notable saying of king Antiochus, doth well declare: who on a time of hunting, being strayed from his company and benighted, was fayne to take for his harborowe, a poore cotage of the countrey, and there, as he was vnknowen at supper with the vplandishe people, through communication, heard diuers thinges frelye talked of his owne behauour Therfore on the morow, when his ministers brought to him his purpre raiment and diademe, he tourning to those ensignes sayed. Sins the time I first began to were you, yesterday only and neuer before I herd the truth frankly spoken. Wherfore the best and most sure waye for a noble gouernour, after the counsaile of the excellent philosopher Demetrius, is to reade such bookes, as most wittily and pithilye treate of the states of common weales, and namely histories in the which he shall playnelye see sette foorth before his eyes

what best beseemeth him to dooe, what to eschew: what maye aduaunce the state of his common weale, what maye hurte and hynder the same: howe and by what meanes hatred and grudge is bredde toward him, and howe and by what wayes he maye wynne loue and fauour: What maketh his realme weake, what maketh it stronge: What maketh it wealthye and riche, what maketh it poore and beggarly: what maketh it floryshe many yeres▪ what maketh it miserable in short space: in bookes shall he lerne to know the wilie flattering foxes, from his sure and trustye friendes: good and faythfull ministers, from false feigning dissemblers: Whom and how he ought to chose his counsaylours, how and what lawes he ought to make. Thus (I saye) he shall learne out of bookes to bee him selfe to him selfe, the best the trustest and surest counsaylour. And for thys consyderacion wold I wish, that the summes of all such lerned workes, were drawen out into short brigementes, to the ende that prudent gouernours (whych for theyr manyfolde affayres and businesses, haue but small tyme of leisure) myghte in liew of other playes, passe the tyme therwyth, like as the Epitome or brigemente of cronycles is, whych not many yeeres passed was begunne by a studious yong man named Thomas Lanquet, & nowe of late by me finished▪ and continued, from the incarnacion of Christ, to the seconde yere of the reigne of our soueraine lord king Edvvard the sixt.

               che forme and ordre that a diligent reader may as in a mirrour behold the state and condicion of all realmes at all times, and know what gouernours ruled theim, how many yeres they reygned, and what notable actes were done in the time of their reigne, whan the Britaines, & likewyse the Scottes, came fyrste into thys lande, with the succession of their kinges, and the whole discourse of the historyes of both countreis: so that ye may perceiue, what notable acte was done in any realme vnder euery king of England, and what yere of his reigne. For the yeres of the kinges of this land be noted in the margent, wyth the

yere of the worlde and of Christe. In the computacyon wee haue folowed the moste sure accompte of the byble and Hebrews, whiche dyffereth muche from Eusebius and other latine Croniclers. These my labours (suche as they be) most excellent prince, I thought most conuenient to publish in your Graces name, not for the wel handling of the same, nor yet because I iudged it worthie so noble a Prince: but onely as I dyd of late exhibite the correction of sir Thomas Eliotes Dictionarie to the kinges most royall maiestee, to testifie my louing and obedient herte toward his highnesse, so doe I nowe offer this symple gyfte to your Grace, as a witnesse or testimonie of the good zeale and loue, whiche all men ought (as well as I) to beare toward you, for your christian and vertuous gouernance, and especially for your godly zeale in aduancyng the true religion of christ: wishing continually with most hertie prayer, that you gouerning vs so benignely, so mercifully, so godly, mought alwaye liue in moste happy felicitee, and bringe this diuersitee of opinions to a perfite vnite

            ¶ Of the vse and profite of historyes, and with what iudgement they oughte to bee redde.
            
               
                  ALBEIT FOR MANY CAVSES (whyche we shall hereafter recyte) the readyng of hystoryes doth indifferently auayle all men, yet moste specyallye it perteyneth to kynges and greatte prynces, whose boke it maye be worthely called, because that the knowledge thereof is moste profitable and necessary to all those, whyche haue the gouernaunce of cōmune weales. For not onely the hystoryes of the Gentiles, but also of the holy scryptures, doo in euerye place make mencyon of theym. The holy scryptures, besydes that they make vs certayne of the wyll and woorde of God, and also of the spyrytuall kyngedome of Chryste, teache vs polyticall administracion, and set forth many notable examples, which in rulynge a publyke weale be necessary to bee knowen, and whereby the myndes of prynces maye be styerred to the study of true nobilitye and vertue. The hystoryes of the Gentyles declare the orygynall and begynnynge of greate empyres, and for what causes there hathe chaunced in theim so gret and so straung alterations & greuous commocyons. In the same is also conteyned preceptes of offyces and vertues, whereby the commune weales may most prosperousely be preserued, contynued and aduaunced. And for thys cause hystoryes are moost worthy to be called the bookes of good princis and noble men. Nowe, forasmuche as vnto euery prynce there belongeth a double vertue, that is, a politicall or externall, and a fayth and feare towarde god, Exaumples of them bothe be shewed to vs out of hystoryes. Therefore we wyll fyrste speake of ciuyle vertues. Princes, yea and all other, that haue auctorytye in greate affaires and hyghe matters, oughte those examples and actes chyefelye to consyder, wherby they maye be admonyshed, by what meanes they maye mooste prosperouslye exercyse them selfes in the gouernance of the weale publike. They must sette before their eyes the examples of good kinges and rulers, and of them

must they lerne the necessary dutye and the vpryght trade of gouerning their empyers, that in their reignes, besides the vtilitie and benefyte of the publyke weale, they regarded nothing▪ that iustice and equitie they onely enbraced, that all misdemeanours and offences they greuously punished: and agayne, that towardes good men and pecible they were alwayes beneficiall and gentyl, that for euery cause they woulde not rayse vp warres, but by wynkinge at iniuryes, reteyne peace, and yet in defence of theyr royalmes, were neuer the lesse of an inuincible courage and redye will: finally that by their wysedome, power, and strength, that defended their dominions from all outward hostilitye, and the same in true religyon, welth, quietnes, and in all necessarye artes made to flouryshe. In all whiche qualities our most excellent & gracious prince Henrye the eyghte, hath excelled, and is an example to theym all whiche shall succeede. For in hym alone is coniested and heaped all the sundry good qualities of the auncient kynges, by whyche they opteyned so great renome. Whyche qualityes he hath so practysed in the gouernaunce of hys realme, That I suppose there neuer was in any common weale, any noble prince and gouernoure whiche hath declared mo examples of wisedome, or shewed mo benefites and pleasures to hys countrey than hys grace hath. But to the purpose. For the contrary parte.
            ¶In the examples of tyrannes they maye obserue dyuers thynges: as, The ende of them to be miserable▪ and that through theyr crueltie many mischefes and daungerous cōmocions haue chaunced in theyr common weales As it appereth how Pharao for tyrany peryshed, and for lyke cause the Romain kynges were exiled. Princes haue oftentymes distroyed one the other, only for pryde, disdain and enuy, and that many tymes begun vpon nothyng. Euen as it was the only cause of the cruel warres betwene Cesar and Pompei. The Romayne hystoryes shew, that the desyre of noueltie hath oft been the stirer of moost greuous warres. And the sect and reygne of Machomet had none other begynnyng but of heresy and dissencion of the artycles of the fayth. It auaileth them muche that bee in auctoritye, to marke these thynges in the redynge of hystoryes▪
               
that they lerne to beware, foresee, and auoyde lyke thynges in their gouernance. For the same chances daily happen, all be it the persones nowe and than be chaunged in the commune weales, ne uerthelesse as pertaynynge to the similitude of busynes and trouble, the worlde remayneth the worlde, and lyke vnto it selfe. Therfore most truly Thucydides (who was a man excellente in the knowledge of warrefare, and also wrate the greatte and longe warre, and other sundrye thyges, whiche chanced among the Grekes) sayth, Hystoryes be a treasure, whiche ought neuer to be out of our handes, that therby beynge ayded, we maye the more commodiously handle suche busynesse and like chaunces in the commune weale, for as much as the causes often tymes chaunce almoste lyke.
            ¶Furthermore there be axaumples founde in hystoryes, conuenient for euery man priuately in his degree, as magistrates ought to be obeyede, and that they neuer escaped vnpunished, whiche haue rebelled against theym, euen as Dathan, Absalom, Catiline, Brutus, Cassus, and suche lyke for their sedicion haue ben worthily punished. Of the fidelitie of frendes, as Ionathas saued the lyfe of kynge Dauyd. Of the punyshment for homicide, adulterye, and suche lyke offences, as it appereth by the example of Dauid. But what shal nede many wordes. Euen as in euery arte paternes be geuen to folowe: lykewyse in hystoryes be peinted before our eyes examples of all kyndes of vertues. But yet in examples and deedes it is more euydently perceyued, what the dignytye of vertue, and agayne, what the bacenesse of dyshonestee and vyces bee, than in bare preceptes, because that examples, set as images before vs, do not onely openly teache, but also bothe warne and stirre our myndes, so that therby wyth a certayne delite and desyre they be kyndled towardes vertue and honestie. For who in hert can be so stubborne and hard, that will not be moued, if he rede anye thynge notable, that is either worthy prayse, or els exāples vtterly to be abhorryd
            I haue shewed briefely how in readyng of hystoryes examples of politicall vertues and ciuyle affayres ought to bee obserued, Nowe it perteyneth to a true christen man. (who aboue all thynges oughte to esteeme godlynesse, to

knowe, that he maye gather also out of hysteryes, examples of faythe and feare of god: For these be the specyall vertues of good men, which in the syghte of god be moste auailable. Al be it that the hystoryes of the gentyles doo not teache, that god careth or hath oughte to do wyth vs: yet a godly mynde neuerthelesse shall consyder, that the publyke weales in the worlde be conserued by the power of god, and that is the worke of god to punyshe and reuenge all oppressyon, and vyolence, ye and that vnto the heathen God gyueth excellent qualities. For princes can not preserue their empyers agaynst the assaultes of Sathan, wythout the syngular benefyt of god, and the ayde of theyr owne vertue and wisedome. And so by thys maner a good man maye well suppose, that these actes and punishmentes be the w

               rkes of god, and therby may lern the feare of god. As that tyrannes haue been greuousely punyshed accordynge to thys sentence: He that taketh the sworde, that is, whyche wythout auctorytye vsurpeth the ryght of reuengyng, he shall peryshe by the sworde. Contrarywyse, it is euydent, that good prynces bee preserued and defended by god, and that also the Ethnykes did well perceyue, in that theyr princes had great affiaunce in the helpe of theyr goddes. For Homere the poete sayth: God casteth his sh

But this thynge is more playnely expressed in the hystoryes of the holy scrypture, as in Noe, Abraham, Moses, Dauyd, Ezechias, and the other princes and kinges, whom god alwayes preserued. And their examples be set before the eies of all other princes, that they maye certaynly know, that in lyke maner god wyll defende all good kinges. For thys difference is betwene the holy and prophane hystoryes, that in them be shewed the testymonies of the workes of god, and the whiche do not onely entreate of cyuile matters, but chiefly doo represente vnto vs the kyngdome of god, that god geueth his word, that of his mercy he wyll saue vs, wher in the hystoryes of the gentiles be ignorant. Therfore principally the hystoryes of the holy scripture ought to be knowen

to all chrysten men, that therby they maye learne the doctryne and stablishement of faithe.

That Sathā wyth all the power of the worlde assaulted the worde of god. Moreouer, that God meruaylously perfourmed hys promyse aboue the opinyon and capacitie of mans wytte. Also that examples bothe of horyble vengeance, and also of grace and forgyuenes be shewed to vs of God, So vnto kyng Dauid and other chanced remission of syns, that by theyr examples we myghte bee comforted and beleue, that god wyll forgyue. Neyther thys is to be neglected that for the confyrmacion of our myndes, God hath geuen vs all sortes of prophecies of externall kyngdomes, that by the fulfillying of them, we maye haue a testimony that our woorde is of god, neyther that any other faythe than ours, is true. And that we maye bee admonyshed by them, whan Christ ought to come, and whan the consummacion of the worlde shall be. Finally, for the ryghte vnderstandyng the prophecyes, it shall be very expedyent to knowe the successe and alteracion of the monarchies and kyngdomes, wyth the computacyon and noumber of the yeres, whyche be in the hystoryes of the Gentiles exactly set foorth

            ¶Of the origynall begynnynge of man, after the false opynion of the Ethnike philosophier.
            
               THe phisosophyer of auncyent tyme (who wythout knowledge of the verye true godhead, many hundred yeres gone, haue sette oute historyes in writynge) were of diuers opynions, concernyng the originall begynnyng of man. Forsome of them beleued the worlde to haue been a thynge vncreated, that is to saye, without begynnyng: and incorruptible, that is, neuer to haue ende: and lykewyse mankynde to haue been of eternall continuance. Other some of theim were of opynion, that the worlde was created and corruptyble, and auouched, that man toke the begynnyng of generacion by succession of tyme. For their imagynacion was, that at the fyrst begynnyng of thynges▪ bothe the skye and the earthe bad one sole sourme and shape, the nature of the one wyth the other intermingled, and in proces, the same bodies disseuered, the vniuersal worlde to haue receiued thys order whiche we se at thys presente. And fyrste the ayre to haue founde the same continuall mouynge, and the fyry parte thereof, by reason of lyghtnesse, to haue mounted to the highest places, the Sonne, and other sterres, of the same cause to haue gotten theyr courses, and what was myngled wyth moysture, stylle to haue remayned in the fyrst place, by reason it was heuy, and coulde not ryse, whyche inferior thynges, beyng mixed or heaped together by commixtion, the sea to haue ben produced of the moyste or lyquyde thynges, and of the harder stuffe or matter▪ the erth in conclusion to haue remained clammy and nesh. Whan this erthe, at the fyrste begynnynge, was through the feruente heate of the sonne settled and growen to a thycker and more massy substance, than the vppermoste partes of the same wythin a shorte space, by the power of the heate swelled into littel bunches, and certayn humoures in manye sundrye places gathered and congeled together by it selfe, in whyche humours dyd aryse certayn corrupcyons of rottennes, couered througheout with a lyttell thynne scumme or creame, lyke as it chaunceth in the marshes of

Than the earthe after this, partely wyth the parchynge heate of the sonne, and partlye wyth the wyndes warynge styll drier and dryer, surcessed bryngyng foorthe beastes of any great quantitye, but those that were alredye ingendred, broughte foorthe others, eche of his owne kynde, through mutuall cōmirtion and engendrynge one wyth an other. And in the very selfe same wyse, they saye, that man also was at the fyrst begynnyng produced, and that he, seekinge his foode in the wylde fieldes, long tyme lyued a saluage and rude lyfe, as vnto whome onely the fruicte of the grasse and of the tryes dyd of it selfe myn

And where the sowne of theyr mouth was suche as myght not be vnderstande, they made a distinction of one word from an other by littell and lyttel, and called eche thynge by a seuerall name. Albeit for as muche as thei were placed in sundry corners or regions of the worlde, they vsed not all

no maner wordes or speach: and therfore there was (saye those phylosophers) sundrye fourmes and facyons of letters. And the companiss of men fyrste essembled, they reporte, to haue ben the fyrst progenitours, euery company of his owne nacion, but the fyrst men, hauynge no maner staye of helpe or succoure, liued an harde lyfe, because they hadde no knowledge nor prouision to saue and laye vp the fruytes of the fyeldes to occupye afterwardes in time of neede.

Therfore by reason it semeth, that there men shulde fyrst ingender, where they myght moste easely be nouryshed.
            ¶On the other parte, the Scithyans supposed the temperatenes of the ayre to be no argumente of antiquitee. For nature, whan she deuided colde and heate into regyons, forthwith ingendred creatures apt to suffer the qualityes of the places, yea and trees, fruytes, and herbes accordyng to the disposicyon of the regyons. And howe muche more sharper the ayre is to the Scithians, than to the Aegypcians, so muche the harder be they of bodye and wyt. Moreouer, if the worlde, whyche nowe is deuyded into elementes, hath ben confused all in one, eyther the water in the begynnynge sourroundyng al thynges, or elles the fyre, whiche also ingendred the world, possessynge it, the Scithians in the originall of bothe begynnynges were the more anciente. For if the fyre fyrste possessed all thynges, whiche by lyttell and lytell quenched, gaue place to the earth, there was no place so soone disseuered from the fyre, by the colde of wynter, as the northe, in so muche as nowe there is no lande so vehement colde. Aegypt, and al the east was very long, ere they were temperate, bycause that nowe they be euen seared with the feruent heat of the sonne, Or yf all the erthe at the firste was couered wyth waters, certes the highest partes, the waters assuagynge, were fyrst discouered, and in the lowest groundes dyd longest abyde, and the sooner that euerye parte of the earthe was dry, so muche the sooner began it to bryng foorth lyuynge creatures. But Sc

falle into the greate meere Meotis, from whence it runneth into the seas of Pontus and Aegypt. Which Aegypt (of long time hath ben defended with the cares and charges of so manye kynges, fortified with so greate bankes agaynst the violence of watres, trenched out with so many dyches, that where the water is kepte out in one place, it may be receiued in another, coulde not be inhabited, onlesse Nilus were helde out) can not seme to be of any antitiquitie, but rather appeareth to be a la

            By these argumentes the Aegyptians beynge ouercome, the Scithya is alwaye haue ben reputed the more ancient people amonge the Gentyles. But nowe I wyll leaue to wryte of the vayne fantasye of the Ethnykes, whyche I haue here sette foorth, to the intent, that the reders maye perceyue the blynde iudgmente of theym, whyche wythout the knowledge of god and his scryptures, woulde define the origynall of man. And here consequentlye I wyll begynne my fyrst booke, with the creation of man, accordynge as it is sette foorth in the holy scryptures, the aucthoritee and certayntee whereof is moste sure: whiche I wyll continue vntill the tyme of Abraham: durynge whiche tyme the worlde stode without prescript administracion or certayne lawe, but onely was ledde by the lawe of nature. For in thys hystorye I shall vse this order, and shall deuide my booke into thre ages, of the whiche the fyrste shall conteyne those thinges that were done betweene the tyme of Adam and Abraham: the seconde frome Abraham vnto the comynge of Christ, and the thirde frome the incarnacion of Christ vnto this present tyme.

Moreouer, vnto hym God gaue power ouer all thynges, that were on the earthe, and in the sea, so that vnto all beastes, fowles, fyshes, and wormes, Adam dyd geue a propre and a conuenient name, accordyng to the natures of theym, euen as they be called at this daye. Than was he broughte by the almyghty lorde into the pleasaunte place of Paradyse, replenyshed with all pleasure. The felicitye of whiche place S. Augustine dooeth in thys wyse descryue: Man lyued in Paradyse as he wolde, howe longe he willed that whiche God cōmanded, he lyued hauyng the fruicyon of god by whyche goodnesse he was good: he lyued without any necessitie, beyng in his power so alwayes to haue lyued. Meate was ready, that he shulde not hunger: drynke, that he would not thyrst: the wood of lyfe, that age shulde not dyssolue hym. In hys flesshe was perfecte healthe, in hys mynde no lesse tranquillytie. As in Paradyse is neyther heate, ne colde, so in his inhabitantes is no offence of good will, nothyng at all sorowfull, nothyng vainely glad.

This is nowe bone of my bones, and fleshe of my fleshe, she shalbe called woman, because she is taken out of the man, vvher fore man shall forsake his father and mother, and shall cleane vnto his vvyfe, and they shalbe tvvo in one fleshe. The lorde blessed the m and sayed. Encrease and multiply, and fyll the erth, and subdue it▪ and be ye lorde ouer the fyshes in the see, the foules of the ayre, and all beastes that moue on the earth. But man, whan he was in this hygh felicitye, coulde not perceyue it, for thorough the craft of the enuious serpent (whyche a lyttle before for his outragious pryde was dryuen out of heauen) and the prouocatyon of the woman, he transgressed the commaundemente gyuen to hym by god, wherfore they were driuen out of paradyse, and made subiecte to deathe synne, and all kyndes of misery, for the earth was restreygned, that it shulde no more bringe forth fruites of it selfe, but by sweat and paynfull labors they shoulde leade their lyues. Than came syckenesse vppon theym, and heate and could began to assayle theyr tender bodyes. For whan thei began to synne, god dyd open the power of Sathan, and agaynst hym, of the seede of the woman, he promised that Christe shuld come and destroy the power of Sathan, and deliuer vs free from death and synne. Thys was the fyrst declaracion of the gospell, whyche began the kyngdome of Christe and the Churche. And so Adam and Eua tooke comforte of the promyse of Chryste, and of these two persons the churche beganne.

is vnderstande confusyon, and by the other the vysion of peace.

Abell the yonger, was of contrary condycions: he gaue hym selfe to vertue, and in all thynges that he wente about, he thought god to be present, his occupacion was in kepynge of beastes, and gaue vnto god the best of all thynges. For in theyr sacryfices his offryng, with fyer descendyng from heauen, was foorthwith consumed, but his brothers remayned vntouched. Wherfore Cayn (perceyuynge that his brother was of God preferred before hym) with malyce, and disdeine therat stirred, slewe hym.

For in the fyrste generacyon Seth was borne, in the seconde Enos, in the chyrde Caynan: in the forthe Malalehell: in the fyfte Iared: in the syxt Enoch: in the seuenth Mathusalem: in the eighte Lamech, and in the nynth was Noe borne, who is the tenth to Adam. For proprely (accordyng to the mynde of. S. Augustine,

the begynnng of Adam was no generacion, but a formacyon: Neuerthelesse the plasmacion of Adam is reckned among the generacions, where he is accompted in the fyrst. Seth in the second, and so consequently, whyche maner is more vsed.

Whereby it appereth, that there was no fewer monethes in a yeare, than there be nowe. And as they lyued than muche loneger than we do nowe: so it is playne, that they had farre greater bodyes than we haue nowe. Sayncte Augustyne writeth, that he hym selfe sawe in Utica, the thicke to the of a man, of so excedynge greatnesse, that it myghte well haue made a hundred of our teeth.

After the recytall of the byrth of the sonnes of Noe, foorthwyth the holy scrypture declareth the occasyon of the floude, because the worlde began to waxe wicked: and there is rehersed amonge the chyefe of their vices, the contempte of god, adultery, and crueltye, in the whyche they exercysed all kyndes of voluptye and pleasure. For thus the texte hath: whan that men began to multiplye vpon the earthe, and broughte forth daughters, the chyldren of god, seynge the daughters of men to be fayre, tooke theym to their wyues. The holy scrypture calleth the chyldren of

god, all those whiche descended from Seth, and the chyldren of men those, whiche issued from Cain. For Adam commanded, that the children of Seth shulde in no wyse couple with the children of Cain: which long tyme was obserued, till that the zele and loue of vertue decayed. God therby perceyuyng, that the wickednes of man was great vpon the erth, repented that he had made man, not that there is any suche passion in god, but that the scripture so speaketh to vs after a familiar and worldlye maner: and therfore thretned a destruction to the worlde by a floudde, and wolde therfore Noe to declare this .120. yeres before it shulde come. In the meane tyme he commanded hym, that he should builde an arke, that shoulde conteyne in lengthe .300. cubites, whiche after the exposicion of Hugo and S. Augustine, were .300. perches, euery cubite geometricall beyng six cōmon cubites: in widenesse it was .l. perches, and in depenesse, from the vpper decke to the bottome .xxx. perches, and the roufe ouer it in height one perche. This arke was not by mans power brought into the sea, but by the course of the waters, rysynge vp, it was borne awaye, and rather by the diuine prouidence, than by mans policie, it was gouerned from renuynge to wrecke. Noe began to builde this in the .523. yere of his lyfe, before the floud, as Berosus witnesseth, 78. yeres. In the .vi.C. yere, the seconde moneth, the lorde saied vnto Noe, that after seuen dayes this deluge shulde fall, in whiche space he brought into the arke, his stuffe, prouision, and al other thynges necessary for hym. Wherat euery man laughed, and toke hym as one madde, that dreamed of suche a floud. But finally (as it is written in the gospell) thei were eatyng and drynkyng, they maried and wer maried, euen vnto the daye that Noe entred the arke, and wolde not knowe it vntill the deluge came, and destroied them all. Not that it was vnknowen vnto them but that thei dispised to beleue it. For Noe shewed it to them as well in woorde as in deede. Also the buyldyng of the arke was a certaine declaracion therof, but thei were without faith and feare of God, for whyche cause they were worthily punished. Thus the tyme passyng, the .17.

daye of the seconde moneth. Noe with his wife, and three sonnes, and theyr wiues entred the arke. And beholde, sodeinly there came together vnto him bestes of al kindes, not brought thither by man, but euen by the miracle of god. Neither did Noe take theym, but suffered theym as they came to entre, ne there came anye more than of vncleane beastes two, a male and a female, of cleane bestes seuen, foure males and three females, of the which one male was reserued for sacrifice after the floud, the resydue were kept for generacion.

All lyuing creatures dyed, except fishe, and suche as mighte endure in the bowels of the earth. The waters encreased, a. Cl. daies, and on the .xvii. daye of Octobre, the arke stacke vppon the mountaines of Armeny. The last daye of Ianiuer Noe opened a windowe, and put forth a crowe, which streight waies retourned. After seuen daies he put forth a dooue, which came againe at nyght, bringinge a branche of Oliue with grene leaues: Neuerthelesse he taryed seuen other daies, and put forth the doue agayne, whych neuer returned. Yet wold he not issue out, but remained for the cōmaundement of the lord, who commaunded him, not to go foorth before the .xvii. daie of the seconde moneth: wherby it appeareth, that he remayned a iust yeare in the arke.
            ¶Berosus the Caldei maketh mencion of this floude in this maner: Before the famous deluge of waters, wherby the hole world perished, there preceded manye yeares, which of our Caldians were faithfully obserued. They write, that about Libanum was a great citee of giantes called Enoch, who were lordes of the world from the rysing of the sonne tyl the sonne sette. They trustinge in the hugenes and strength of theyr bodies, with armure that thei had inuented, oppressed all men. They deuised tences, musical instrumentes, and all delycacyes: they fedde with mans fleshe, and companied commonly with theyr

mothers, doughters, sisters, men, and beastes: there was no wickednesse, which thei omitted. Then many prophecied and preached, that a destruction shoulde come, whiche they did write in stones, but they scorned al thinges: There was one of these giantes, wiser then all the other in Siria, whose name was Noa: he with his thre sonnes Samo, Iapeto, Chem, and theyr wiues Titea, Pandora, Noela, and Noegla, fearinge this destruction, whiche he perceiued by the starres, began to make a shippe in faciō of an arke .78. yeres before the floud. In the same yeare that the shippe was finished, sodeinli the occean swelled, and all the seas, flouddes, and sprynges, rose aboue the mountaines, with continual rayne that fel from the heauens, wherby all mankinde perished, excepte Noa wyth his familie, who were saued in the shyp, whiche the waters bore vp to the toppes of the mountayn Cordie
                  •
               , wherin my time remained part therof. These be the woordes of Berosus, who with his Caldeans are deceiued in this, that they thinke Noe to forese the floud bi the starres, and not by the diuine reuelacion.
            ☞When Noe had continued a yere in the arke▪ the waters beīg assuaged, and the erth dried, god commaunded him to come forth, vnto whom incontinent he buylded an aultare, and offred of beastes and byrdes a dylectable sacrifice. Then god instituted as it were a newe worlde agayne. Fyrst of al, he gaue his woorde, by the whiche he promised, that he woulde no more destroye the worlde with water: and for the confyrmacion thereof, he gaue the rayne bowe for a sure token betwene him and man. For in that bowe is expressed bothe the colours of water and fyre, the one part being blewe, the other red, that it might be a witnesse of bothe the Iudgementes, the one past, the other to come: Also he graunted libertee to eate fleshe, whiche the holy fathers before the floud neuer vsed. Moreouer, god gaue a newe precepte for the administracion of externall thinges, and cōmaunded more plainely, that whosoeuer shed mannes bloud, his bloude should be spilte againe of theym, to whom it was lawfully committed, that is by the magistrates and rulers, for man is made to the similitude of god. This Noe faythfull

vnto god, and an other father vnto mankynde, hauyng in the space of .100. yeres his issue wonderfully increased, beyng also throughly learned in the knowlage of diuine and humayne thynges, in the reuolucion of times, in the histories of the worlde passed, but moste specially in iustice and relygion, deuided the world into thre partes, whiche he hym self in the residue of his life peragrated, leauynge in all places perpetuall monumentes bothe of his vertue, and also of his empire. He inuented also the vse of wyne, with whiche he was made drunke, so that he laye vnhonestly discouered. Who beyng sene of Cham, the father of Canaan, was of hym scorned, and in derision broughte his twoo bretherne to beholde this sight: but they, moued with shamefastnesse and honestee, couered their fathers membres, and wolde not see them. The whiche whan Noe perceiued, he blessed theim, but Cham he wolde not curse, because the lorde blessed hym: therefore he cursed Chanaan his nephewe, the sonne of Cham: who, as some suppose, derided also hys graundfather. He liued after the floud .350. yere, and for his sundry benefittes, shewed vnto all nacions, they gaue vnto hym diuers names: among the whiche these as the most famous, bee celebrated: Noe, Ogyges, Fenix, Uranos, Coelus, Sol, Protheus, Ianus, Geminus, Iunonius, Quirinus, Patulcius, Bacchus, Uortumnus, Chaos, Ileton. Seede of the worlde, and father of al goddes, and princis. The Italians, after his disceasse dedicated to hym, by the name of Uortumnus, a temple, and worshipped hym with diuine honours and ceremonies. And also his wife Uesta, for hir great prudence and benefites, o bteyned these names: Erthe, Opis, Aretia, Uesta, Cybeles, the greate mother of the goddis, who taught the maydens to kepe the holy fyre, whereof arose the erroure and ceremonies of the virgins Uestales. The residue of their actes shalbe declared in order, as thei were dooen. ¶ After the vniuersall floud, the worlde by the children of Noe, was shortly replenished with people. For god, or nature, neuer yet fayled the necessitee of thynges. Of theim there arose many famous and mighty nations.
            Sem, the prince of Asia, called also Melchisedeth, a

iust and peacible kyng, and priest of almighty god, from whom Christe liueally descended, possessed all Asia with his children. For of Elam cam fyrst the Persians: of Assur the Assyrians: of Arphaxat the Chaldeans: and of Aram the Syrians.
            ¶Cham, the seconde sonne of Noe, prince of Aphrike, called also Innuus, Iucubus, Syluanus, Pana, Saturn of Aegypt, the raiser and spreader of the wickednesse punished with the floude, inhabited the southe parte of the worlde, with his familye. Of Canaan, came the Cananees, of Phuth the Libyans, of Mezraim the Aegyptians, of Chus the Aethiopians, & of Saba the Arabians.
            Iaphet, prince of Europa, called also Iapetus Priscus, Dyris, Maurus, Athlas, receiued of his father Noe, for his porcion, all the countreyes of Europe, frome the Gades, called at this tyme the streictes of Marrock, vnto the greate ryuer Tanais. Of hym came these princis and nacions: Comerus Gallus, who fyrst reygned in Italy: Magog, of whom came the Scithians, and of them the Turkes: Madaus, of whom sprange the Medes: of Iauan the Grecians, whiche were called Iones: of Tuball the Spaniardes: of Mosoch the Moscouites: and of Tyras the Thracians. I haue briefely declared, what parte of the worlde euery of the sonnes of Noe inhabited, whyche to the vnderstandynge of manye histories shall beenecessary.

                  The yere of the worlde 1757
               
                  The yere before Christe 2206 For Nemroth, after he had by force broughte his borderers vnder subiection, exhorted to his enterprise Iectan, comen of the stocke of Sem, and Suphue, one of the chyldren of Iaphet. For by these thre princes gouernance and fortune, the hole posteritee of Noe was ruled. Nemroth was a man veray bold and eloquent in tunge, and sayed: That the felicitee of man ought not to be ascribed vnto god, but that rather euerye man obteineth it by his owne industrie. For which cause he perswaded the people to builde an high towre, ouer the whiche the water shuld not arise, and that the top thereof should reache euen to the heauens. The multitude were ready to fulill the commaundementes of Nemroth, esteming the obeysaunce of god to be a greuous bondage, and builded the towre. But as soone as they began, God foorthwith (as the holye scripture testifieth) by this meane dashed the pride of the buylders. That where so many nacions gathered together, which in number were .lxx. vsed but one language or speche, god so confused theyr tongues, that euery one of theim spake in sundry speches, that the one might not vnderstand the other: wherby of necessitee the woorke was lefte vnfinished, and they scattered abrode through al the world.
            ¶After this varietee of tungues chaunced, dyuers kyndes of monstruous people were brought forth in sundry places S. Augustine in his booke intituled ye citee of god, writeth in this maner: God knowing in what similitude or diuersitiee of the membres of mans body, the beaultie therof is comprehended, wold also bryng into the worlde many monstruous people, that therby the pryde of man might be abated. Therefore what so euer maner men be borne in any place, so that they be creatures reasonable, mortal, and begotten of man, ought not to be doubted, albeit thei be deformed, and contrary to our nature.
            
               
               The first Monarchie.
               
                  
                     IT is to be vnderstand, that those thinges, which be done of magistrates and rulers, ought to be taken and honoured as the worke of god. We haue warned afore ī our preface, that god wold the world to be gouerned by .iiii. monarchies, ye policie, iustice, & correctiō might be kept amōg mē: therfore many thinges be spoken of them in scripture. God did set forth these monarchies or empires to Daniel by two facions. The first vnder the similitude of a man, whose head was of golde, his breast of siluer, his bealy of brasse, hys legges of yron, his fete, parte of yron, parte of earth: and howe christ the stone brake the feete, that the man should fal, and so the world to ende. Daniel interpreted this vision to signify the .iiii. monarchies. For (sayeth he) the golden head signifieth the first monarchie, which was of the Assyrians: the siluer breast, the kingdome of the Persiās: the brasen bealy, the reygne of the Macedons: the yron legges, the empire of the Romains: the earthen and yron feete, do betokē this present state of the empire of Rome, because that at this season it is of lesse power and reputacion than it hath bene.
               ¶The foure beastes that were shewed vnto Daniel, signified the figure of these monarches. The Lion declared the strength of the Assyryans: the beare the power of the Persians: the leopard the valyant courage of Alexander: the fourth beast the puissaunce of the Romaines.
               ¶There is more ouer, that other cruel kingdomes shuld rise, whiche should ordeine harde and straight lawes against the religion of Christe: by whome is vnderstande the reygne of Mahomettes and Turkes at thse dayes. So faithfully God remembreth vs, that the histories of the world knowen, we maye consider the ende therof to be at hande, and that by this meanes we may establishe our fayth.
               It appereth in the Bible that the first kyngdome was

begun by Nemroth amonge the Babyloniās, whom the scripture calleth a stronge hunter before the lorde, that is a mightye prince, who by force brought people to his subiection. In that he was called a hunter, is signified, that he was a deceiuer of soules, an oppresser of men: and for that he withdrewe men from the true religion of God, he was so called.
               ¶ This Nemroth, called also Nimrod, and Babylonicall Saturne,
                     The yere of the worlde 1788
                  
                     The yere before Christe 1175 was the sonne of Chus, who was the son of Cham. He began the first empire, and reigned .56. yeres. He builded the towre Babell, whyche he lefte vnfynished: and finally for his wickednes was of the infernal spirites rapte in to hell. Frome Nemroth, Berosus the Chaldey, and Metastenes the Persian, began their chronicles.
               ¶ The firste Monarchy began among the Chaldeis, as Xenophon testifieth, and the posteritee of Cham reigned firste, of whome Nemeroth had his beginnynge. All be 
                     〈◊〉
                   that Cham was cursed, yet god wōderfully deferred both the punishement and promyse. Notwithstandyng the impyre dydde not continue in the handes of the posteritee of Nemroth. For among the Assyrians rose vp a new kingdome by Assur, of whom Niniue was builded, who subdued the citee of Babylon, whyche Diodorus Siculus doeth wryte, and by this occasyon the Monarchy was changed from the Chaldeis to the Assyrians. Strabo and diuers other make mencion of the citee of Niniue, that standeth in Assyria, wherby it maye bee easily gathered, that Babylon and Niniue were two sundrye cities, and not one citee, called by diuers names.

               ¶Nowe that we be come to the habitacion of Scithia, we shal briefly declare theyr historyes. The nacyon of the Scithians, bothe in theyr originall beginninges and empires, were no lesse renoumed by theyr women, than by theyr men. They thrise obtained the empyre of Asia, whiche they kept tributarie vnto them, vntyl the time of Nynus, they them selfes remaining cōtinually witho ut the subiection of other princis. They put to shamefull flight Darius king of Persia, thei ouerthrew Zopyrona the capitaine of Alexander with his armye: in like maner they slew Cyrus with all his power. They rather heard of the Romans, than felt them. Of theym arose the nacions of the Parthians, people veraie laborious and hardye in

warres. Among theim no crime is so greuous as thefte, for they, hauyng their substance and cattell without houses or other defence, might haue nothyng in sauegard, yf theft were not sharpely punished. As for gold and syluer thei dispise: as muche as other nacions desire it. This cō
                  tinence hath taught theim rightuousnesse, that they neuer desyre other mens goodes. For the desyre of riches is there, where the vse of it is. Whiche moderacion and absteinyng from other mens good; I wishe vnto all men: for than truely so great warres shoulde not so longe nor among so many bee continued, neither shulde the sword destroye more men, than the natural course of doth shuld take away. Certes, this semeth wonderfull, that nature shuld geue vnto theim that, which the Christians by the godly wisedome of Christe, by the long preceptes and instructions of holy men, can not attein vnto. Muche more preuaileth in theim the ignoraunce of vices, than in vs the knowlage of vertnes. Finally from theim hath come people fearefull and vengeable to all the worlde, as the Alanes▪ Hunnes, Gothes, Bulgarois; Slauanois, Turkes, and Tartarians▪ Moreouer the women of that nacion, at the riuer Thermodoon reuenged the deathe of their husbandes, with the slaughter of theyr ennemies: and lest that some shoulde seme more happier than other some, they slue all the men that remained, and forthwith abhorred the desyre of matrimonie, calling it rather bondage than mariage. Neuerthelesse, whan that by warre they had obteined peace, and by theyr valiaunt prowesse had conquered a great part both of Asia and Europe, stablishyng theim a kyngedome by the name of Amazons: Than leste their nacion should decaye through lacke of men, they vsed the company of theyr borderers. If men children were borne, thei were either slain or sent to their fathers: the women thei preserued, exercisyng theim not in sowyng, spinnyng, or idelnesse, but in feates of armes, ridyng, and huntyng. The right pappes of theyr children thei feared of, that it shoulde be no lette to theim in shootynge. For whych cause they were called Amazons, that is, hauynge but one pappe. By this maner exercise thei became so strong and hardy, that they feared not to fight

hand to hand with the most valiant princes, Hercules, Thesius, Achilles, and the great Alexander. But howe long time these women continued, or when they ceassed, we can not certainly finde, yet we rede, that Minothea, one of theyr quenes, for the desyre too haue issue by the great Alexander, came with .30000. women .25. dayes iourney to him, and after thirtye dayes returned, beynge conceiued with childe.

stoode without any prescript administracion, or certaine lawe, by the woorde of god. The second age beginneth here at the byrth of Abraham, and continueth to the coming of Christ, albeit as touching the iust number of the yeres, this worlde is not complete: because, as we haue warned afore, god hasteth to the consummacion thereof. Yet this is the verie and propre age of the world, in which circuncision and the lawe were geuen, with certaine policies, and the true veneracion of god also instituted. Wherin also the mightye kyngdomes and Monarchies succeded one an other. For the worlde neuer declared at any tyme his myght and power, as he dyd in this age. At this place Eusebius began his chronicles, who folowing the veritee of the hebrues, might greatlye haue profited his posteritee, but because he ensued the greeke exemplars, he greatly erreth in computacion of yeares.

                  TO THE ende that ye shal know in what place the word and church of God was, we will shewe somewhat of the spiritual kingdome.
            Abraham, the prince of fayth, was borne in Ur, a towne of Chaldey, the 292. yere after ye vniuersal floud, the 44. yere of the reigne of Ninus, & the 1262. yere before ye building of Rome, whē the true honor & worde of god begā to ceasse in the royalme of Chaldea, Thare went frō thens to Mesopotamia, with his sonne Abraham, because he wold not be defiled with ye wicked supersticions and idolatrie of the Babyloniās. The scripture calleth this idolatrie Vr chaldeorunt, that is, the fyre of Chaldeie. For when in the sacrifices of the godly the fyre falling from heauen; burned theyr sacrifyces, the vngodly folowinge the example of theym, kyndled theyr fire, and so instituted a new honouring of god, wythout the knowlage of the comming of Christ. This fire is called Ori masda, that is to say, the holy fier, whyche kynges

commanded to be borne before them vpon horses: For the first occasion of idolatry, by this fier began amonge men, before that images were in vse. Therfore Abraham the mighty and renoumed father of the elect nation, lefte his countrey and kynsfolkes, by the commaundement of god, and takyng with hym Lot, wente to soiourne in the lande of Canaan. From whens shortely after, thorough greate famine, he was constreigned to go into Aegypte, where he, fearyng the foule lustes of the Aegypcians, woulde not be knowen of Sara to be his wyfe, for to aduoide the danger that myght chaunce through the beautee of hir. He there (as Iosephus writeth) declared god to be the creator of all thinges, teachyng them the sciences of Arithmetike and Astrologie. Finally he retourned into Cananee, where he deuided the countreie, Lot choosyng Sodome, and Abraham Hebrō. After this Lot was taken, whom Abraham deliuered. and rescued the spoyles, which the princis of Assyria had taken, and receiued with blessynge of Melchisedech, kyng of Salem and high priest of almighty god (called also Sem the son of Noe) bread and wine: to whom Abraham gaue the tenth of his praye. The apostle sayeth, that this Melchisedech was without genealogie, because his progenie is not rehersed in the scripture. Than Abraham begat on Agar his maid Ismael, of whom cam the Ismaelites, afterwardes called Sarracenes. Finally in the .99. yere of his age, beyng thryse blessed of God, and hys name increased, the promise of the euerlastyng testamente, by the circunsion of the fleshe confirmed, he, accordyng to the commandement of god, begate on the olde and barayne Sara hys worthy wife, the gentil Isaac, beyng bothe promised and blessed of god: whom he circumcised, and woulde haue offered in sacrifice, had not god, seyng his prompt obedience, letted hym. At the laste, whan this moste holye patriarche had geuen Rebecca, the daughter of Nathor, to Isaac, to bee his wife, he died, beyng a .175. yeres of age, whose holy body his sonnes Isaac and Ismael buried in the tumbe, where his wife Sara laye.

The voyce of the yll doers shall be agaynst him, not knowing his resurrection. But the bloud of his innocēcie you shal receiue on your hedes. And in his passion the stones shal cleaue a sunder, the sonne shalbe darkened, and all other thinges shal be troubled, the inuisible spirites shal tremble, and helle shal be spoyled, he shall open the gates of paradyse, and shal make the thretnynge swoorde agaynst Adam to stande, and shal geue vnto his saynctes to eate of the wood of lyfe. Belial shall be bound by him. Then shal ye se Enoch, Noe, Sem, Abraham, Isaac, and me your father, rising in ioye from the ryght hande of god, and shal geue power to his chyldren to ouercome pernycious spirites: and as many as beleue in him on the erth, shal also reioyce.

Then almyghty god, shewinge that not by mannes prouidence, but by his, the effecte of all good thinges be opteined, saued this litel helpeles childe. For he caused Termuth the doughter of Pharao, to walke to the riuer side to sporte her, where she sawe this vessel swimming on the water. Incontinent she cōmanded

it to be brought to hir, and openyng it, founde therein a wonderfull fayre and goodlye babe, for the whyche she not a litell reioysed, and accordyng to the chance named it Moyses, whiche signifieth, preserued from the water. After this, for the fauour and towardnesse of the childe, she adopted hym for hir sonne, and caused hym to be instructed in all the learnynges of Aegypt. It chaunced on a tyme, that the kynge, for his daughters sake, tooke the childe in his armes, and set the crowne vpon his heade: whyche Moyses, as it were chyldyshly playing, hurled it to the grounde, and with his feete spourned it. But the priest, the soothsayer, beholdynge this, cried out, & sayed, that this was he, whom before he had prophecied shulde be borne, whiche wolde destroie the kyngdom of Aegypt, except he were by deth preuented. But Termuth excused the childe, alledgyng▪ that his age had yet no discrecion and for proofe therof caused bournyng coles to be put to his mouthe, whiche the chylde with his tungue lycked: wherby he euer after had impediment in his tongue. By this meanes theyr furye at that tyme was appessed. In processe of time there arose cruel warres betwene the Ethiopians and the Egiptians. The Ethiopians destroyed Egipt, toke theyr townes, ouerranne theyr countreye euen vnto Memphis, theyr principal cyty. On the other parte the Egipcians, by this necessitee compelled, fledde for councell vnto theyr oracles and diuinacions: where thei receiued answere, that thei must elect an hebrue, capitaine of theyr army, by whose helpe they shuld not only expulse the Ethiopians from theyr borders: but also bring them vnder theyr subiection. Moyses, both for his wisedome and personage, was chosen soueraygne capytayne of this army, he so polytikely ledde his hoste, that vnwaxes he set vpon theim, and at the fyrste battayle put theim to flyght, wherein he slewe a great number. And when they in no place were able to resyst him, they fledde to theyr strong citie Saba. In which, whiles they suffred the siege, and Moises often valyantlye and politikely assauting theym, he was of the kynges doughter of Ethyope vehemently loued. Who not able to sustayne the power of loue, by certayne faythful ministers, requyred of

Moyses mariage: he vppon condicion to rendre to hym the citee, was contented. Whiche through the meanes of the mayde was quyckely fulfylled, and he maried vnto hir. By this occasion he subdued all Ethiope, retournyng to Egypt with great triumphe: whiche prosperitee to the Hebrues was hope of libertee, and to the Aegypcians cause of great feare. Wherfore they sought dayely occasion howe to destroye hym. Whiche Moyses perceyuyng diligently imagined to auoyde theyr deceytes, and denied hym selfe to be the sonne of the doughter of Pharao, chosyng rather to be afflicted with the people of god, than to enioye synfull pleasure of the worlde. Wherfore he slue an Egypcian, whiche oppressed an hebrue, and fled into Madian, not farre from the mount Sinai, where he was receiued into the house of Iethro, priest of that citee, who gaue to hym in mariage his doughter Sephora. There he continued .xl. yeres, and kepte sheepe.
            ¶ This haue I drawen out of the historie of Iosephus, the residue of Moyses lyfe shall be declared after his retourne into Egypte.

And therfore the souerāine gouernance among theim was vncertaine, sauyng onely in the roume of the his priestes. But God added to theim for helpe often times certaine wise princis, whiche he chose, now in one place, now in an other. Wherfore the Israelites tindyng them selfe greued with his vncertayne gouernance, desired of Samuel their high priest, to haue a kyng to rule them as other countreis had: Samuel wold not doe any thyng vnaduisedly in so great a matter. And therfore asked counsayle of God: Who shewed him selfe to be greatly displeased with the vnlefull request of hys people, and thretned that they shuld be therfore greuously punished. How be it he graunted their request, and ordeined Saul to be their kyng. Here the power of kinges and gouernaunce of kyngdomes was ordeined and established by God. Wherfore it is to be marked, that god was not therfore angry, because he disalowed the power and auctoritee of kynges, but because he was displeased with the vnconstant mynd and affection of the people, in chaungyng that kynde of gouernaunce in the commune weale, that was by hym ordeined.

               ¶The holy man Dauid by the commandement of God, was anoynted kyng of Israell, of the prophete Samuel. Whom Saul (after the spirite of god had forsaken hym) partly forenuy that Dauid was so highly praised of the Israelites, and partly fearyng that he wold defeate him of his kyngdome, vexed with continuall persecucion: duryng which tyme Dauid shewed many exaumples, both of godly pacience and also of loyal obedience toward his

prince. In so muche, that whan Saul (by the prouidence of god) fell in his handes: he onely cut a peece of the hem of his garment, in token that if he had listed at that present, he might haue slayne hym, and for that dede, afterward greatly repented, that he had ben so bold, as to cut the hemme of the garment of Saul his soueraigne lorde and kynge, notwithstandyng that he was his moste greuous enemy, and euery houre sought his death.

Wherfore he was so muche honoured, and prospered so well, that he subdued to the Lacedemones innumerable cities and countreys in asia and Grece, whan one demanded a thyng of him, whiche was vniuste, sayinge that he had promysed it: He aunswered: If it were iuste, I promysed it, but if it were vniuste, I spake, but I promysed it not: he neuer spake with any woman, sauing his wyfe, but either in the temple, or afore all men, thinking those two places to be void of suspicion. Whan he was demaunded, why he laye no more richely than a priuate person, he aunswered: That a prince ought to excel other men, not in delicacie, but in temperance and moderate lyuing. Truly the lyfe of this man was wonderful, and worthy to be an example to other princes, as it appereth in Plutarke, which wryteth at large.

               About this time, thorough the warres and dissencion of the Iues, there arose among them sundrye sectes and opiniōs in theyr religions, of which there were .iii. sorts.
               The first were called Pharisei, that is, segregate or chosen. They vsed certayne constitucions of men beside the lawe of Moyses, by whiche they were segregate frome the residue of the people. They reputed theim selfes better then all other, they obserued feigned fastes, prayed commonly in the stretes, that they might be sene and called maisters. Their learning was some what better thē the others. For they taught the immortalitie after this lyfe, and that god would punishe sinne: they bel

               The second sect were Sadduceis, they cloked theyr wickednes vnder a glorious name. For Sadducei is as much as iuste or holy. They taught, that there was neyther angell, spirite, nor life after death: that god gaue the lawe onely for this, that honestly and quietly we should lyue receiuing of god here in this life the rewards of iustice. They interpreted the scriptures according to the iudgement of mans reason: neither any other thing wold they here, & as concerning that which pertained to the maner of theyr liuing, they were plain Epicures.

               ☞Marcus Tullius Cicero, was consul of Rome, with C. Antonius, whose diuine eloquence, abundant lerning sharpenesse of witte: dexteritee in actes, and most ardēt loue toward the common weale of his countrey can not be sufficiently expressed by no mortall mannes tunge or penne. His auncestours were named Cicerones because that Tulliꝰ Appius a noble king of Uolscis, and one of that progenie, had on his nose a marke like a chich whiche is a kinde of pulse called Cicer. He so profyted in the eloquence of Greke and Latine, that not only his companions were in a merueilous admiracion of him but also Appolonius, the moste excellent oratour at that tyme, in hearing him, was greatly abashed, and kepinge sylence a long space, sayde at the laste: Truely, Cicero I prayse the, and meruaile at the, but I lamente greatlye the fortune of Grece, when I consyder, that not onely noblenes in dedes of armes and marciall affaires, is taken frome vs by the valyantnesse and puissance of ye Romains, but also that the great prayse and glory of lerninge, whiche was only left vnto vs is now by the translated to Rome Whiche saying was founden afterwarde very true, for loke what subtilitee is in Logike, what commoditee and secrete knowlage in phylosophie morall and naturall: he knew and declared the same in latine in most perfecte eloquence. And (whiche is to be wondred) atnotwithstanding, that he being a verye yonge man, came to practise in Rome, and had studied abundantly the ciuile lawes, and was meruailously occupied in greate and weightye causes, and after that he was senatour, was continually (as it semed) most busye about the weale publike, yet he that doeth reade his workes (althoughe we haue not the thyrd parte of them, whiche he wrote) shall thynke, that he neuer did any other thing but reade great auctours, and wrate bokes. And yet did he exploit by his wisedome and diligence many great enterprises, for the commoditee

and sauegarde of his countrey, as well in warre as in peace. For the whiche the Senate and people gaue to him firste before anye other, the name of Father of his countrey.
               ¶Catiline enterprised his conspiracy, whyche by the great wisedome and diligence of Cicero was suppressed and Catiline slayne in battayle by Antonius, who list to reade the history at length, let him resorte to a booke intituled the conspiracy of Catiline, trāslated into english by Thomas Paynell, where it is abundantlye and elaquently set forth.

               I Haue hitherto briefli ronne ouer the liues of .72. kinges, which reigned here in Britaine from the arriuall of Brute vnto the comming of Cesar: the history wherof (as I said before) is very vncertaine & obscure. Yet neuerthelesse I haue not varyed from the vulgar opinion therof, but haue brought the same in to a more certaine ordre, conferring them with the other

histories and gestes of the world, wherby they haue a better apparance of truth. But now, that I am come to this time, in which the Britons beganne to be knowen to the Romaines, and other nacions of the world, hauing also the helpe of credible historiens, whiche before I lacked, I shall the more veritably and in better order set foorthe our histories. And for the better declaracion of this chronicle, you shall vnderstande, that the numbres set in the inner side of the page, signifie the yeres of the reignes of the kīges of Britain, wherby may be perceiued in what yere of the reigne of a kinge, anye notable thinge in the world was done. As for the historye of Cesar I haue gathered it out of his cōmentaries, and out of the worshipful Beda whome I thinke more credible than our newe historiens.

His quarell was, because that in the warres of France, he perceyued the Frenchmen to haue much succour and ayde from thense. Wherfore preparinge .lxxx. shippes he sayled into Britain. Where at the first being weried with an harde and sharpe batayle, and after with sodein tempest his nauy almoste destroyed, he retourned again into Fraunce, there to winter his men.

                  Anni regum britannie 8 he passed the seas agayne with a greater army: but whiles he went towarde his ennemies on lande, his shippes lying at ankor, were againe by tempest almost lost, for eyther thei were driuen on the sides, where thei stack fast or els beyng driuen one vpon an other were destroyed so that .xl. perisshed, the other with muche labour were saued. Upon lande also his horsemen ot the first encounter were vanquished, and Labienus the tribune slayne. At the seconde conflicte, not withoute great daunger of his men, he put the britons to flight, and poursued theym to the riuer Thamis: on the further side wherof Cassiuelā with a great multitude of people was kepinge the bankes,

but they not hable to resiste the violence and force of the Romains, hid them selues in woodes, & with sodeine eruptions oftentimes inuaded them. But in the meane time theyr strongest citee Troynouāt▪ submitted it self to Cesar, deliuering vnto him hostages: whiche exāple also the other cities folowed. Whereby Cassiuelan after many losses, was constreigned to giue pledges, and to agre that Britaine should be tributary to the people of Rome Then Cesar, like a conquerour with great noumbre of prisoners, sayled into Fraunce. Thus ended the warres which he made in Britain, whereby he rather opened o waye for his successours to come to the same, thā that he deliuered to them the dominion thereof.

Antonius wedded her, who warred against Augustus: of whom he was ouerthrowē for sorowe wherof, she closed her selfe in a tombe being on liue, and hauing two adders suckinge on her brestes, so died. She was a woman excellinge in plesauntnes quickenes of witte, and sumptuous ryotte, in so muche that at one (banket contending with Antonius in excesse of fare,) she drank aperle resolued in vineger, which was estemed at .100.

And in the last battayle whyche was at Munda, a towne in Spayne, they foughte soo sore and harde togither, and suche slaughter was made that the old and assured souldiours of Cesar were not ashamed to geue backe, wherby Cesar despairinge to wyn that fielde, would haue killed him selfe, leste after the renoume of so many cōquestes and victories, he shuld haue fallen in the power of those yonge men, whose father he had vanquished. But finally, succouring his men, the armye

of the Pompeis was put to flight, the one of the bretherne beinge slayne, the other fleing away. After whiche battayle, Cesar finished those ciuile warres, whiche during the space of .v. yeres, troubled the whole world. Antipater by Cesar was cōstituted procuratour of Iudea
            Cesar retourned to Rome, he reformed the state of the common weale, amended the calender, reducinge the order of the yere, to the course of the sonne, founde out the cause of the leape yere, and in his honour and memorye, the people attributed to him the moneth Quintilis, whiche after his name was called Iulius. But he contynued not passing .v. monethes in reste, for waringe insolent againste the senatours, and takinge theyr lybertee frome theim, there conspired against him to the numbre of .260. senatours and gentilmē, among whom Brutus and Cassius were chiefe, Whiche in the Ides of Marche, when Cesar came into the senate house, with .xxiii. woūdes, he was slain among the senatours. Thus Cesar lost al that whiche wyth the bloude of .lx. M. citezens, and .1192000. his ennemies, he had gotten. And as he had filled all the world with his ciuile bloud: likewise nowe he filled the senate with his owne bloud. After this sorte Cesar finished his life, a man in featnes of warre excellinge al other, he wrote no man swifter, and red no man faster, at one time he could endite foure letters at ones, he was furthermore of suche clemency, that those whome he had subdued by warre, with his great gentilnesse, wonne them to be hys veray frendes.

As soone as he herde of the deathe of his vncle Iulius, he hasted from Appolonia to Rome to possesse his inheritance, and to reuenge the death of Cesar, here the ciuile wars were againe renued, for the senate fauored the kyllers of Cesar, but Antonius wold haue suppressed theim with ciuil warre, for whiche cause he was iudged by the senate to bee an ennemye to Rome, and the consules, Hircius and Pansa, with Octauianus, were sente agaynste him: by whom he was vanquished, but the consules were slayne.

Wherfore Antonius sent one Herennius (whom Cicero had saued from death by his eloquēce) to slea him, who pursued him as he fledde oute of the citee: whiche thing Cicero perceyuing, abode his comming, lying in a horse litter for weakenes, and prepared his throt to Herennius, who strake of his head, and his right hand and brought theim to Antonie: who caused theim to bee sette ouer the place of ciuile iudgementes in Rome. Cesar and Antonius, committinge the charge of the citie to Lepidus, went with their power against Brutus and Cassius: who had taken Laodicea, pursued Dolobella to deathe, vexed the Tharsenses, toke and spoyled Rhodes, but in Phillippo, by Cesar and Antonius, they were

vanquished, and slue theim selues. After whiche bataille they deuided the empire betwene them, Cesar takyng for his parte Spaine, Fraunce and Italy, and Antonius all the oryent.

Whose enterprise, and the honest affection, that he therein declared towarde his countrey, I thinke worthye memorye. For if he might haue gon through as he begō, and wel brought forwarde the same: vndoubtedly it woulde greatly haue delighted theim that take pleasure to reade the notable and famous thinges done longe before our tyme. For he hathe briefely set foorthe the gestes and actes of forayne and straunge countreis, and therwith iuigned the hystorie of this realme of Englande, after the opinion of most writers, euen from the firste arriuing of Brutus, in such wyse, that a diligent reader maye gather, the variable state and condicion of all countreis and nacions at all tymes. But deathe (whiche spareth no man, ne can bee eschewed) brake his course, and (as it were) trypped hym in the myddes of hys rase, that he coulde not atteyne to the marke, wherat he ranne. Wherfore, lest they that desyre the profitable knowlege of histories, should be destituted of so great a commoditee: and lest the fruites of so diligent a labour shoulde lye hydde, and tourne to the profyte of no man: At the instance of certaine of my nyghest frendes, whose requestes (the matter so standing) I could not well denie: I haue taken vpon me to fynishe this cronicle, although in dede. I greatly dispaired, that I shulde be able to accomplishe the same. But when I considered, firste, though it were an harde matter, yet might it be ouercomen with labour: than, howe profitable the exercise should bee for me, to reade and peruse so many good auctours, as were necessary for the performaunce of the same: Thirdly, howe honeste a labour it was, so to employ

the vacant time that I had from other necessary businesses. I sho

Wherfore you (gentyll reader) shall take well in worthe this my boldenesse, and perswade youre selfe (as the trouthe is) that I was moued to this excercise, rather of good wille▪ to profytte my natural countrey, and to do pleasure to other men, than for any fame or aduauncemēt, that I hoped might come to me therby. And if I se, ye take it well in gree, vndoughtedly you shal encourage me hereafter, to goo in hande, with some exercise, that shal perchaunce tourne to more profytte, and pleasure, of theim whiche be desirous of honest knowlege.

For the souldiours being as than in Pannonie, raised a greate sedicion, & in their rage beatte & murdered diuers of their tribunes & other officers, which cōmocion after much peines was lastly quyeted by Drusus the sonne of Tiberius. In like maner, & for like causes, was great trouble & vnquietnes in the hoste that lay in Germanie. At which time, whan Germanicus their captaine, exhorteth them to quietnes, the souldiours obstinately refused the empire of Tiberius, & profered to make him their emperour, but Germanicus wolde rather haue slaine him selfe, with hys owne weapen, thē by such vnlawful meanes, to obteine the imperiall auctoritee: And moreouer, the commons of the citee of Rome, & diuers of the nobles also, hauing in their hertes (as it were) a naturall hatred towarde the Monarchy, or highe power of Cesars: diuised and imagined with theim selfes, diuerslye, howe to extinguishe the imperial auctoritee, & bring the citee to her pristinate for me

and gouernaunce of consulles, which thing they more ernestlye desired, for so muche as they had as yet, freshe inmemorie, the swetenes of theyr ancient libertees, and the fame of man

After whiche sorte, (god willing) I purpose to go foreward, in the part folowing, concerning this realme of England, is chiefelye to be marked, how the Saxones, after they first entred this land, by craftie meanes augmented theyr rule and dominion, vntil at lēgth they chased the Britons, and by force of armes droue theim all together out of theyr countrey and for that they were named Angli, called this Iland after them Anglia, whiche was deuided a certaine of time into .7. kingdomes, & after reduced to one monarchye by Aluredus king of west Saxones, here also ye may note, the increase of the kingdom of France, & the great ruine & decay of that most flourishinge & victoryous empyre of Rome. Whiche in puisaunce so farre surmounted all other monarchies and kingdomes: as the fierce Lyon in might and courage dooeth passe the other common beastes whiche (notwithstandinge) was so ouer ronne of the barbarous people in those later daies, that the citee of Rome, which .700. yeeres had continued as lady and empresse of the worlde, within the space of .100. yeare, was foure times taken and most cruelly spoyled, with all the countree of Italy, to the manifest example, that nothing in this world is of suche strength and power, that it may alway continue and endure.

For saint Cyprian writing often to Cornelius bishop of Rome, neuer calleth him otherwise than brother, or felowe bishop▪ the like is founde in the woorkes of Tertullian, Hierome Chrisostome, Augustine, and other auncient writers▪ yea and the coūsayle of Carthage hold in the yere of our lord 419.

That the worshippyng of the consecrated bre ade, is ydolatrie. That there is none other purgatorye but Christes bloud. That we can not honour sainctes better▪ then by folowyng them in faithe and vertue. That mans frewill is so letted by the fall of Adam, that▪ without goddes grace it can do no good thynge. That it is faith whiche bryngeth vs saluation. That no mannes traditions ought to be receyued to bynde conscience. That to haue ymages in temples, is very daungerous, for fallyng into ydolatrie.

Wyth these commissioners were sente certein godlye learned preachers which dehorted men from superstition, and enstructed them to geue theim selfe to true and vnfayned worshyppyng of god in heart and mynde, with due obedience towardes theyr prince.
            This yere order was taken that the pompous and superstitious maner of goyng in processi

               The last day of Iuly, Steuen Gardiner Bisshoppe of Winchester was sent prisoner to the towre of London.
            And about the same tyme, Doctour Smith of Oxford recanted openly at paules crosse, diuers articles conteyned in twoo bookes whiche he had made: one for the defence of the sacrifice of the Maise, an other to proue that vnwritten verities oughte to be beleued vnder payne of damnation.
            Shortlye after, the Lorde Protectoure and Erle of Warwike, wente into Scotlande with a stronge army requiringe the Scottes to fulfyll their promise made before to kynge Henry, concernynge the mariage of theyr younge Quene with noble prynce Edwarde hys sonne.

                  •
                at a place called Pinkersloughe, the englishmen not thinckynge as then to haue battaile. And because the fronte of the Scottishe army was so terribly set with pikes, our horsemen that gaue the firste on set, were enforced to recule, with losse of certen gentlemen, whiche reculynge muche abashed our footemen. But yet, by the great wisedome and pollicye of the capitaynes, and the good stomake of our souldiours, wherewith god had at that present strengthed them: they gaue a new onset, and without any notable fight discomfited the Scottes and optayned a noble victorie. At this tyme were slaine of the Scottes betwene thyrtene and fouretene thousande, and not passynge an hundred Englysshemen.
            This yeare dyd the pestilence so rage in the Citie of London, that men fell to buryeng their deade, early in the mornynges, and late in the euenynges, whervpon a commaundemente was geuen to all curates, that they shoulde bury none before .vi. in the mornyng, nor after vi. at nyght, and that a bell should ryng .iij. quarters of an houre or more.
            After Myghelmasse was holden a parliament, wherein chauntries were giuen into the kynges handes, to be altered and disposed at his pleasure.
            
               It was also ordeyned in this parliam
                  •
               nt, that the body and bloude of Christe shoulde be receyued of all persones in bothe kyndes, breade and wyne. And an order was appoynted for the auoidyng of sturdy vagabundes and beggars.
            In this meane whyle, Peter Martyr, a Florentine borne, and of excellent knowlege in diuinitie, being sent for by Thomas Cranmer archebyshop of Canterbury: came into Englande▪ in Nouember, and shortely after was made reader of diuinitie in the vniuersitie of O

            Also in this parliament were repealed certain bloudy statutes made in the tyme of kynge Henry the eight,

            The fifte day of Februarye, the aboue named duke of Somerset, with the reste of the counsaylours of the realme, dyd wryte vnto the Scottes in the kynges name, a very longe and piththy Oration, exhortynge theim to embrace peace, but in vayne, as afterwarde appeared, to the great losse of bothe realmes.
            In this February hotte persecution beganne agayne in Fraunce, and especially at Paryse, for the doctrine of Martyn Luthere, where as in the meane whyle, in Englande, mens wyttes were occupied in dyuysynge howe to abolyshe the masse vtterly.
            In Aprile folowynge, Martine Bucer, beeynge sente for by the marques of Brandenborough one of the princis electours, came frome Strawsborough in Germany to Aus

of Coleyn caused to bee drawen, and was afterwardes sette forth in his name. But yet when they had made it as perfect as they coulde, and had confirmed in it all popery, welmoste it coulde not be allowed by Gods vicar of Rome, bicause there were in it some thynges graunted to the contrary parte.
            The fyrst day of October Edmunde Boner byshop of London was depriued of his byshoprike, and put in prison in the Marshalsey, for that he obstinately stode in the defence of popisshe supersticion, and Nycholas Ridley byshop of Rochester, was by the kynges authoritie transl

            The fourth day of Nouember was a parliament holden at Westminster vpon prorogation, wherin was authorised a boke of an vniforme order of common praier and administration of the sacramentes in the englishe tongue.
            Also the mariage of priestes was in the same parliament made laufull.
            Moreouer the acte made in the .xxxii. of the reigne of kyng Henry the eight concernyng contractes of matrimonie, was in this parliament repealed, for that many beastly persons, maliciousely enterpreting the same, did by obtaynyng the firste carnall copulation, take frome honest men their despoused wyues.

            In Aprile, Martine Bucer and Paulus Fagius, men of excellent learnyng, after many letters sente to theim from Thomas Cranmer archbyshop of Cantorburye, came into Englande, and were frendly receyued of the kyng hymselfe, of the whole nobilitie welmoste, and of the people also.

of Christe.
            In Maie folowynge Peter Martyr and the diuines of Oxforde, disputed openly of the Lordes supper and the presence of Christe therein. These questions dyd Peter Martyr propone and defend. That the substance of bread & wyne is not changed, and that the body and bloude of Christ is not carnally and corporally in the breade and wyne, but is sacramentally vnited or knitte therevnto. The report of this disputation was afterwards setforth in print, wherin the moderatours of the disputations appoynted by the kyng, doo plainely declare, that Martyr had the vpper hande.
            In Iune folowyng, the French kyng came to Parys, with great pompe, and this was the fyrst commynge of hym thyther after the deathe of his father, where at his beyng there, and in his presence, as some thynke, many were put to death for Luthers doctrine. And the kynge, as it appered by a writyng then set forthe in printe, and sent into all partes of Fraunce, was there professed an open enemy to that sorte of men, determynyng to roote theim quite out of his dominions. And not long after, he cut of mounsier Ueruines heade, for that he had surrendred Boloigne to kyng Henry the eyght, after a long siege and sore battrie and assaultes.
            About this tyme, there began in England great sedition emong the people in all partes, but chiefely in Norfolke and in Deuonshire. The chief capitaine in Deuonshire was sir Iohn Arundell a knyght, and in Norfolke one Kite a tanner. These bothe required groundes lately enpastured and enparked to be layd open agayn, but the chiefe cause of their rebellion was to haue the popish masse and ceremonies restored. They wronghte muche by a blynde prophecie, whiche tolde them that they shuld mete at London. And in dede so they dyd, for they were brought prisoners thither in one day, and committed to the tower. Suche is the good successe that they haue whych folowe blynde prophecies.
            In this meane whyle dyd the french kyng inuade and wynne the forte whyche kyng Henry had buylded beetwene Boloigne and Calice, called Newhauen, the losse

whereof was layde to the Duke of Somersettes charge, for that he beeyng protectour hadde not seene that piece better furnished. And in conclusion Iohn Dudley the Erle of Warwyke with the assent and helpe of others, counsellours and nobles of the re

            The fowerth day of Nouember a parlyment was holden at Westminster vpon prorogation, and there continued and kept to the fyrst daye of February, wherein was made an acte for the punishment of suche as would vnlaufully assemble them selues. Also an acte for the restitution of bloud in syr William Sheryngton knyght, and an other for Mary daughter to syr Thomas Seimor high Admyral.
            In this meane whyle, Paulus Fagius dyed at Cambridge about the ende of Nouember,

            In the beginnyng of February, the byshop of Strausborowe had brought his matters to passe, and made perfect his ministers, and began solemnely in .iii. churches of the Citye, whiche the Senate had permitted hym to occupie, the Popishe maner of theyr goddes seruice, to the great admiration of youth, whiche had sene no such monstrous mummeries before.

And about the .xxv. of Aprille, the towne of Boloigne with the fortresses thervnto belongyng, was deliuered by the Englyshemen into the handes of the Frenchemen.
            The seconde day of May was brent in Smithfielde a woman called Ione Knel, otherwise called Ione Boucher, for the horrible heresy, that Christe toke no flesshe of the virgine Mary. And at her death dyd preache one mayster Iohn Scory, then preacher at Canterbury.

            The .xxv. of Maie there was an earthquake in Sotherie, and in parte of Middelsex.
            About the same tyme there was a dutcheman burned in Smithfielde for holdyng the opinion of the Arrians.
            At this season there fell amonge the englyshe nation, a very daungerous sweate, bothe in the realme, and in strange countreys, insomuche that many died in verye shorte space. And muche fruite of the repentance of former lyfe appeared sodeynely. For some abated their vnreasonable rentes, and many soughte for the poore and nedy in prisons, and els where, to relie

            In Iuly the piece that was coigned for .xii. d. was by proclamation abated to .ix. d. & the piece of .iiij. d. to .iij. d. And in August after from .ix. d. to .vi. d. and frome .iij. d. to .ij. d. And the piece of .ij. d. to a penye, and the penny to an halfepeny.
            In October, the duke of Somerset was agayn appreapprehended,

and committed to the tower, and with him syr Michel Stanhop, syr Rafe Fane, syr Miles Partriche, and other. For then was Iohn Erle of Warwyke, mde duke of Northumberlande, whose deathe he sayd, the duke of Somerset had conspired.

            In this meane while, the younge Kynge was entised to passe time in maskeyng and mumminge. And to that ende there was piked oute a sorte of misrulers to deuyse straunge spectacles in the courte, in the tyme of Christmas to cause the yonge kynge to forgette, yea rather to hate, hys good vncle, who had purged the courte of all suche outrage, and enured the kynge vnto the exercyse of vertuouse learninge, and hearynge of sermons. This was the high waye, firste to make an ende of the kynges vncle, and after of the kyng hymselfe.

            The .xxiij. of this monethe Edwarde duke of Somerset was beheaded at the towre hyll in London, where at the tyme of his speakynge to the people, there felle suche a sudden feare amonge the people by reason of a rumoure that ran abrode of the duke of Northumberlādes power of horsemen to be in a redinesse about the Citye, and an horse man that came in hastilye at the northe syde of the towre hill that they fell to shufflynge and thrustynge, as men that stoode in daunger of their lyues.

At the laste whenne the people perceyued that there came no mo horsemenne, they supposed that he that was comen, had brought a pardon for the Duke, and therefore they beganne to shoute and cast vp theyr cappes. Whyche thynge when the duke perceyued, he beckened with his cappe in his hande for silence. And that obtayned, he wylled the people to quiete theim selues, to obeye the rulers, and to loue theyr yonge kynge, and to pray to god for hym, that he myght long lyue and reigne ouer theym. As for hym selfe, he loked for no pardon, other then at Goddes hand. And so he prepared him selfe to the axe, wherin he behaued hymselfe so soberly and humbly, that none so harde herted about hym, that dyd not shedde teares.

Towardes wynter he retourned to London, & frō thens he went to Grenewich, wher was prepared matter of pastyme, a fort counterfaited, riding at the tylte, and goodly pastimes at Christmas, tyll the kyng had gotten a cough that brought hym to his ende.
            The fyrst day of Marche was holden a parliament at Westmynster,

In this parlyament it was emong other thynges enacted, that no maner of man shoulde selle or vtter by retayle to be dronken in his owne house any kynde of wyne, vppon payne of forfaiture of tenne pounde for euery suche offence.
            In this meane whyle there were three noble shyppes furnyshed for the great aduenture of the vnknowen viage into the easte by the northseas. The great encourager of this voiage was Sebastian Gaboto, an englisheman, borne at Bristow, but a Genoways sonne.

            At the same tyme there were other lyke shyppes sette forthe towardes the southe to seke aduentures.
            All this meane whyle kynge Edwarde was sycke, And his councellours linckinge them selues by maryages. And muche talke ther was that the kynge was poysoned, and some suffered imprisonment and punishmentes for so sayeng, and also for sayeng that he was deade. In fine, the tenthe day of Iuly, it was by proclamation declared in London, that he dyed the .vi. day of that moneth. And at the same tyme, there was a prayer setforth in printe, vnder the testimonye of syr Thomas Wroth, one of the priuie chaumber, and doctoure Owen one of the kynges phisitians, with others: wherein the kyng a lyttell before he departed, besought God to preserue this realme from popery.
            In the abouenamed proclamation whiche was sette forth by the consente of the duke of Northhumberlande and all the learned counsell of this realme, very fewe excepted, emong whome Iustice Hales of Kent was one, and of the Mayre and Aldermen and common counsell of the Citie of London, and moste parte of the Nobilitie, ladye Iane, daughter vnto Henrie Duke of Suffolke was proclaimed Queene, contrarye to that order that was taken in parliamente for the succession of the Crowne in the later daye of kyng Henry the eight, pretendynge the feare of that whiche folowed in dede, that yf Mary should raigne, she would bring in foren power and the bishop of Rome.
            But God, who wil not haue his truth mayntayned by puttyng heyres from theyr right: cōfounded their wisedom. And by that woman whō they wold haue shuldred frō her right, he punished their vnsaciable gatherynge of tresure vnder theyr good kyng. For he so turned the hertes of the people to her & against them, that the ouercam them without bloudshed, not withstandinge there was made great expedition against her both by sea and land.
            For when the counsell at London perceyued that the

common people woulde not stande with theim, and that certayne noble men began to go the other way: they turned their tale, & proclaymed the lady Mary, eldest daughter to kyng Henry, and appointed by parliament to succede Edwarde, dyeng without issue. And so the Duke of Northhumberlande beyng by the whole counsel sent fo

            In this meane whyle, the lady Iane and her husband Gylforde, sonne to the duke of Northhumberland, wer made prisoners in the tower, where they had lyen frome the tyme of her proclamation.

In this meane whyle many men were forward in the erectyng of Altars and masses in Churches. And suche as woulde stycke to the lawes made in Kynge Edwardes tyme tyll other sholde be established: were some of them marked and some presently apprehended, amonge whome Sir Iames Hales a knight of Kent, and iustice of the common place was one. Whoe not withstandinge he had ventred hys lyfe in quene Maries cause, in that he wold not subscribe to the disheritinge of her by the kinges will, yet for that he dyd at a quarter sessions geue charge vpon the statutes made in ye time of Hēry theight & Edward the vi. for supremacie & Religiō, he was imprisoned in the Martialsy Counter & Flete, & so cruelly hādled, & so put in feare by talke yt the warde of the Flete vsed to haue in his hering, of torments that wer in preparing for heretikes, that he sought to rid himself out of this life, by woūding himself with

               About the .xviii. of October, ther was at Poules churche in Lōdon a disputatiō appointed by ye quenes cōmandement, about ye presēce of Christ in the sacramēt of the altare, as thei call it. This disputatiō cōtinued .vi. daies, wherin doctor Weston was chief on the popes part, who behaued himself outragiously in tantyng & checking. In cōclusion, such as disputed on the contrary part wer driuen some to flee, some to denie, & some to dye, though to the moste mens iudgementes that herde the disputation they had the vpper hand. About thend of October, one Michael Seruetus, a spaniard, was put to deathe at Geneua for denying the eternall deitie of Christ Iesus. At this tyme died Iames Sturmiꝰ at Strawsborow, a man of excellēt lerning & vertu, of the age of .lxiii. yeres.

In this mean while Peter Carewe hearyng of that was doone, fledde into Fraunce, but the other were taken, and Wyat came towardes London in the begynnynge of February, from whence themperors ambassadors sped thēselues away in hast al by water. The quene heryng of Wyats cōmyng came into the citie to the Gylde hall, wher she made a vehement Oration against Wyat, declaringe that she neyther had nor wold consent to mary otherwise then shuld seme to the counsell to be for the wealth of the realme.

And lest any shuld escape out of the citie to Wiat, she caused the drawbridge of London to be cut of, and let fal into the riuer Temes. In this mean while was Wyat commen into Southwarke, And after two dayes there spent in vayne: he departed to wards Kyngston, where he passed the ryuer by force, thinckynge to haue comen to London in good tyme, but he was disappointed, partly by breaking the cariage of his ordinaūc

               The .xii. day of February was beheded the lady Iane, and her husbande Gilforde Dudley, two innocentes in comparison of them that sate in iudgement vpon them. For they did but ignorantly accept that which the other had wittingly deuised to take frō others to giue to them.
               The .xxi. of that moneth was Henry duke of Suffolke beheaded at the tower hill, beynge condempned but .iiii. dayes before.
               After this were condemned for this conspiracie many gentilmen and yeomen, whereof some were executed at London, and some in the countrey, and in fine the quene pardoned .iiii. hundreth of the common people.
               The .xv. daye of Marche was committed to the toure, Courtney the Erle of Deuonshire, and the .xviii. of the same, the lady Elizabeth syster to the quene, both vppon suspition of wyats conspiracie.
               Shortely after was apprehended in Northwales the lorde Thomas Graye, brother to the duke, & sir Iames Crofte, whiche lorde Thomas was after executed.
               Immediatly there was a parliament summoned to be holden at Oxforde, where was made great preparation to the great hindrance of many of the inhabitantes. For it was afterward appointed to be at Westmynster, and was there holden the second of April, wherin the quene requested .ii. things, her mariage, & restoring of the pope the one she obtained vpon certaine conditions, the other wolde not be granted as than.
               In this meane while, not onely the straungers that were in kyng Edwardes time, receiued into the realme for religion, emong whom one Iohn a Lasco vncle to ye king of Poland was one: but many englishmē also fled, some to Friseland, some to Cleueland, som to high Germanie, where they

               The .x. daye of Aprill, Archebishoppe Cranmer, Byshop Rydley, and Hugh Latimer went out of the towre

towardes Oxforde, where they had disputacions wyth the deuynes of both vniuersities, and because they wold not recant they wer reserued in prisone, till they might be condemned by the popes autoritie, not withstanding that they answered most substantially and trulye.
               At this tyme was sir Thomas Wyat beheaded at the towre hill, and afterwarde quartered, and his quarters set vp in sundry places, and his head vpon the gallowes at haye hyll ouer the thre that were there hanged in chaines. And shortly after it was stolen awaye thence. Before he came forth to his deth, he did plainly declare that the ladye Elizabeth and Courtney were nothyng giltye of his faction, Notwithstanding that coulde not set the ladie Elizabeth at libertye.
               Duryng this tyme many mad parts wer playd about the citie of London, but chiefely these: A cat dressed lyke a prieste at masse with the cake ouer her heade betwene her handes, was hanged vpon the gallowse at the cros in Chepe. And a ma

               About this tyme Cardinal Pole went from the Emperour to ye French king to intreat a peace, but in vain.

And laste of all, he dyd them to vnderstande, that he toke it for a great benefite at theyr handes that they had restored hym to hys former estate, and therfore he accompted him selfe the more bounde a great deale, to restore them to the heauenly court, which thinge he most desyred of all thynges. And when he had thus spoken, he went out of the parliment house.
               Then stode vp the lorde chauncellor byshop of Winchester, and repeted the Cardinalles oration, with many wordes of exhortation to concorde and vnitie, affirmyng, that we oughte to geue moste harty thankes to god, that of his vnmeasurable mercy had styred vs vp a prophete of oure owne nation, whiche geueth hymselfe wholly to doo vs good.
               The day folowyng, when the parliament had graunted the Cardinalles request, they deuised a forme of supplication to the kyng and queene, wherein they myghte moste humbly beseche them to be meanes to the Cardinall for theim. The effect whereof was this. That they dyd earnestly repent them of theyr scisme, in refusynge to obey the apostolike sea of Rome, and in consentynge to lawes made against the same: promysyng that thence foorth they would be at theyr cōmandement to do what soeuer they shulde be able to do

               Afterwarde, he declared, howe acceptable in the sight of god, the repentance of a synner is, and howe greatly the angels reioyce ouer one sinner that repēteth. And in conclusion he gaue thanks to God, that had geuen them a mynde so desyrous of emendement. when this was done, he arose, and so dyd the kyng and quene also, and then fell the kyng and quene doune on theyr knees. Thā dyd the Cardinall lyfte vp his fyngers, and blesse them, desyryng god to loke mercyfully vpon the people, and to forgeue the offence, and so he absolued the whole multitude. And after this, they wente to the chappell, where thankes were geuen to god with pypynge and syngyng after the maner.

And bycause they woulde not submytte theimselues to the popes authoritie, they were all condemned of heresie. Theyr names were Iohn Hopper bysshoppe of Worcester and Gloucester, Iohn Bradforde, Laurence Saunders, Roulande Taylour doctour of the lawe, Iohn Rogers reader of diuinitie at Paules. And shortely after was condemned Robert Farrer byshop of sainct Dauids in Wales.
