                  About an houre agoe, and somewhat more,
                  I left him fortifying the bridge my Lord,

                  Are both so neare, as nearer cannot be.

                  Nay, by your patience good my Lord a word,

                  Re.
                  Good euen my good Lord Maior, the stréets are chainde,
                  The bridge well manned & euerie place preparde,
                  Shall we now go together and consult.
                  What else there is to be determinde of?
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Your comming M. Recorder was the thing
                  We all desired, therefore let vs consult,
                  And now what say ye, if with halfe our power,
                  Wee issue forth, and giue the rebels fight?

                  Before they do prouoke vs nearer hand
                  There were no way to that, if all be pleasde,
                  Whats your opinion M. Iosseline?

                     h my L. Maior, and M. Recorder,
                  
                  You may take your choice, but in my conceit,
                  Issue if you will, or else stay if you will,
                  A man can neuer be too warie and so forth,
                  Yet as to issue will not be the worst,
                  Euen so to tarrie, wel, you may thinke more on't,
                  But all is one, we shall be sure to fight,
                  And you are wise enough, to sée your time, I, I, a Gods name.
               
               
                  Rec.
                  My Lord accept his meaning better then his counsell.
               
               
                  
                  Ma.
                  I, so we do, or else we were to blame,
                  What if we stoppe the passage of the Thames,
                  With such prouision as we haue of shippes?
               
               
                  Recor.
                  Its doubtfull yet my Lord, whether the rebels,
                  Purpose that way to séeke our detriment,
                  Rather me séemeth they will come by land,
                  And either make assault at London bridge,
                  Or else at Algate, both which enterances,
                  Were good they should be strongly lortified.
               
               
                  Ios.
                  Well said master Recorder, you do, I I, Iye warrant

                  Of Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, and the rest,
                  Are drawne together for their best defence,
                  Beside the Towre, a neighbour to that place,
                  As on the one side it will cléere the riuer,
                  So on the other with their ordenance,
                  It may repulse and beate them from the gate,

                  Which may come they?

                  To hemme vs in, or get the gate of vs,
                  And therefore Cosin Shoare, as I repose

                  I do not shame to say, the Hospitall
                  Of London was my chiefest fostering place,

                  That by his blessings I am come to this.
                  The man that found me I haue well requited,

                  And when as God shall take me from this life,
                  In little S. Hellens will I be buried:
                  All this declares, I boast not of my birth,
                  But found on earth, I must returne to earth.

                  Iane.
                  The gift so small, that askte, who could denie it?
               
               
                  King.
                  Oh she gaue more, that such a gift then gaue,
                  Then earth ere had, or world shall euer haue.
               
               
                  Iane.
                  His hap is ill, should it be as you say,
                  That hauing giuen him what you rate so high,
                  And yet is still the poorer by the match.
               
               
                  King.
                  That easely prooues he doth not know the worth.
               
               
                  Iane.
                  Yet hauing had the vse of it so long,
                  It rather prooues you ouer rate the thing,
                  He being a chapman, as it séemes you are.
               
               
                  King.
                  Indéed none should aduenture on the thing,
                  Thats to bée purchast onely by a King.
               
               
                  Iane.
                  If Kings loue that, which no man else respects,
                  It may be so, else do I sée small reason,
                  A King should take delight in such course stuffe.
               
               
                  King.
                  Liues there a King, that would not giue his crowne,
                  To purchase such a kingdome of content?
               
               
                  Iane.

The world I thinke containes not such fond king.
               
               
                  King.
                  Why mistresse Shoare, I am the man will do it.

                  Its proudly spoke, although I not beléeue it,
                  Were he King Edward that should offer it.

                  But shall I haue it?
               
               
                  Iane.
                  Upon what acquaintance?
               
               
                  King.
                  Why since I saw thée last.
               
               
                  Iane,

                  At the L. Maiors, in the presence of the King.
               
               
                  Iane.
                  I haue forgotten that I saw you there,
                  For there were many that I tooke small note of.
               
               
                  King.
                  Of me you did, and we had some discourse.
               
               
                  Iane.
                  You are deceiued Sir, I had then no time,
                  For my attendance on his maiestie.
               
               
                  King.
                  Ile gage my hand vnto your hand of that,
                  Looke well vpon me.
               
               He discouers himselfe.
               
                  Iane.
                  Now I beséech you let this strange disguise 
                  she kneels.
                  Excuse my boldnes to your maiesty.
                  What euer we possesse is all your highnesse,
                  Onely mine honor, which I cannot grant,

                  Onely thy loue (bright angel) Edward craues,
                  For which I thus aduentured to sée thée.
               
               Enter Maister Shoare.
               
                  Ia.
                  But here comes one, to whom I only gaue it.
                  And he I doubt will say you shal not haue it.
               
               
                  King.
                  Am I so soone cut off? oh spight.
                  How say ye mistris, will ye take my offer?
               
               
                  Ia.
                  Indeed I cannot sir afford it so.
               
               
                  King.
                  Youle not be offered fairlier I beléeue.
               
               
                  Iane.
                  Indeed you offer like a Gentleman,
                  But yet the iewel will not so be left.
               
               
                  Sho.
                  Sir, if you bid not too much vnder-foot,
                  Ile driue the bargaine twixt you and my wife.

                  Alas good Shoare, my selfe dare answere no.
                  King aside.
                  Nothing can make thée such a iewel forgoe.
                  
                     
She faith you shall be too much looser by it.
               
               
                  Sho.
                  See in the row then, if you can spéed better.
               
               
                  King.
                  See many worlds arow, affords not like.
               
               As he goes forth, Shoare lookes earnestly, and perceiues it is the king, whereat he seemeth greatly discontented.
               
                  I.

                  Ah Iane, it is the King.

               The king enters againe, mussled in his cloake.

                  And your beloued husband made a scorne,
                  And if not yéeld, its likely that his loue,

And who ist, hauing plentie in the hand,
                  Neuer commaunded, but doth still commaund,
                  That cannot worke in such excesse of things,

                  Because my Niece his wife is beautifull,
                  And well reputed for her vertuous parts:
                  He in his fond conceit misdoubts the King,
                  Doth doate on her in his affection.
                  I know not Cosin how she way be changde,
                  By any cause in you procuring it,
                  From the faire cariage of her wonted course:
                  But well I wot, I haue oft heard you say,
                  Shee merited no scruple of mislike.
                  If now some gyddie fancie in your braine,
                  Make you conceiue sinisterly of her,
                  And with a person of such difference.
                  I tell you Cosin, more for her respect,
                  Then to sooth you in such sottishnes,
                  I would reucale yée open to the world,
                  And let your folly iustly plague your selfe.

                  Is it not strange, that euer when he comes,
                  It is to her, and will not deale with me?

                  Or else some other trifle to be sold.

So Tanner, now come when yee please, we are prouided,

                  What Iohn Hobs? welcome ifaith to court,
               
               
                  Hob.
                  Gramercies honest Tom, where is the hangman
                  
                     Ned? where is that mad rascall, shall I not see him?
               
               
                  Sel.
                  See where he stands, that same is hee.
               
               
                  Hob.
                  What Ned? a plague found thee, how dost thou for a villaine? how dost thou madde Kogue, and how, and how?
               
               
                  King.
                  In health Iohn Hobs, and verie glad to see thee,
                  But say, what winde droue thee to London.
                  
               
               
                  Hobs.
                  Ah Ned, I was brought hither with a whirlewinde man, my sonne, my sonne, did I not tell thee I had a knaue to my sonne?
               
               
                  King.
                  Yes Tanner, what of him?
               
               
                  Hob.
                  Faith hees in Caperdoche Ned, in Stafford Goale, for a robberie, and is like to be hangde, except thou get the King to be more miserable to him.
               
               
                  King.
                  If that be all Tanner, ile warrant him,
                  I will procure his pardon of the King.
               
               
                  Hobs.
                  Wilt thou Ned? for those good words, see what my Daughter Nell hath sent thee, a handkercher wrought with as good Couentrie silke blew threed as euer thou sawest.
               
               
                  King.
                  And I perhaps may weare it for her sake,
                  In better presence then thou art aware off,
               
               
                  Hobs.
                  How Ned, a better present? that canst thou not haue for silke, cloath, and workemanship, why Nell made it man. But Ned? is not the King in this companie, wshat hee in the long beard and the redde petticoate? before God I misooubt Ned that is the King, I know it by my Lord what ye cals players.
               
               
                  King.
                  How by them Tanner?
               
               
                  Hob.
                  Euer when they play an Enterloute or a Commodity at Tamworth, the King alwaies is in a long beard, and a red gowne like him, therefore I spekt him to be the King
               
               
                  
                  King.
                  No trust me Tanner, this is not the King, but thou shalt see the King before thou goest, and haue a pardon for thy sonne too with thee.
                  This man is the Lord Maior, Lord Maior of London, héere was the Recorder too, but hee is gone.
               
               
                  Hobs.

                  Hobs.
                  I thanke yee good goodman Masor, but I care not for no meate, my stomacke is like to a sicke swines, that will neither eate nor drinke, till shée know what shal become of her pigge. Ned and Tom, you promisde me a good turne when I came to Court, either doo it now, or go hang your selues.
               
               
                  King.
                  No sooner comes the King, but I will doo it.

                  I warrant thee Tanner, feare not thy sonnes life.
               
               
                  Hobs.
                  Nay, I feare not his life, I feare his death.

                  Haue we marched thus farte through the heart of France?

                  Yes gratious Lord, the wounds are bléeding yet,
                  That Talbot, Bedford, and King Henry made,
                  Which peace must cure, or France shall languish still.

                  Besides (my Liege) by these intestine foes,
                  The Constable and trecherous Burgundie,
                  
                  The States in danger if the English stirré.
               
               Enter Mugeroune.
               
                  K. Lew.
                  Tis perilous, and full of doubt my Lords,
                  We must haue peace with England euery way,
                  Who shall be Herald in these high affayres?
               
               
                  Bur.
                  No better man then Monsieur Mugeroune,
                  
                  Whose wit is sharpe, whose eloquence is sound,
                  His presence gratious, and his courage good,
                  A gentleman, a scholler, and a souldiour,
                  A compleate man for such an Embassage:
                  Art thou content to be employde Mugeroune,
                  
                  In this negotiation to King Edward?
                  
               
               
                  Mug.
                  If your most sacred Maiestie commaund,
                  Your humble vassall Mugeroune shall goe.
               
               
                  K. Lew.
                  Gramercies Mugeroune, but thou must assume,
                  A Heralds habit, and his office both,
                  To pleade our loue, and to procure vs peace
                  With English Edward, for the good of France.
               
               
                  Mug.
                  I know the matter and the forme my Lord,
                  Giue me my Heralds coate, and I am gone.
               
               
                  K. Lew.
                  Thou art a man composoe for businesse,
                  Attend on vs for thy instructions.
                  
                     
And other fit supplies for these affayres,
                  And for thy diligence expect reward.
               
               Exeunt.
               Enter seuerall waies Burgundie and the Constable of France.
               
                  Con.
                  Whither away so fast goes Burgundy?
                  
               
               
                  Bur.
                  Nay rather whither goes the Constable?
               
               
                  Con.
                  Why to King Edward (man) is he not come?
                  Meanst thou not like wise to goe visit him?
               
               
                  Bur.
                  Oh excellent, I know that in thy soule,
                  Thou knowst that I doe purpose nothing lesse,
                  Nay I doe know for all thy outward shew,
                  Thou hast no meaning once to looke on him.
                  Brother dissembler, leaue this colouring,
                  With him that meanes as falsely as thy selfe.
               
               
                  Con.
                  I, but thou knowst y• 
                     Edward on our letters,
                  And hoping our assistance when he came,
                  Did make this purposde voyage into France,
                  And with his forces is he here arriude,
                  Trusting that we will kéepe our word with him.
                  Now, though we meane it not, yet set a face
                  Vpon the matter, as though we intended
                  To kéepe our word with him effectnally.
               
               
                  Bur.
                  And for my better countenance in this case,
                  My lingring siege at Nuse will serue the turne,
                  There will I spend the time to disappoynt,
                  King Edwards hope of my consoyning with him.
               
               
                  Con.
                  And I will kéepe me still here in S. Quintins,
                  
                  Pretending mightie matters for his aide,
                  But not performing any on my word,
                  The rather Burgundy, because I aime,
                  At matters which perhaps may cost your head,
                  All this aside
                  If all hit right to expectation,
                  In the meane space like a good craftie knaue,
                  That hugs the man, he wisheth hangd in hart,
                  
                     
Kéepe I faire weather still with Burgundy.
                  
                  Till matters fall out for my purpose fit.
                  Ici sont mon secrets, beau temps pour moy.
               
               
                  Bur.
                  Ici sont mon secrets, beau temps pour moy.
                  Are ye so craftie Constable? procéede, procéede,
                  You quick sharpe sighted man, imagine me
                  Blinde, witlesse, and a fillie Idiot,
                  That pries not into all your policies,
                  Who I? no, God doth know my simple wit,
                  Can neuer sound a iudgement of such reach,
                  As is our cunning Constable of France:
                  Perswade thy selfe so still, and when time serues,
                  And that thou art in most extremitie,
                  Néeding my helpe, then take thou héede of me,
                  In meane while Sir, you are the only man
                  That hath my heart, hath? I, and great reason too,
                  Thus it befits men of déepe reach to doo.
                  Well Constable, youle back againe to Nuse,
                  
                  And not aide English Edward?
                  
               
               
                  Con.
                  What else man?
                  And kéepe thée in S. Quintins, so shall we
                  Smile at King Edwards weake capacitie.
               
               Exeunt.
               Enter King Edward, with Burgundie, Howard, Sellenger, and Scales.
               
                  K. Ed.
                  Tell not me Burgundie, tis I am wrongd,
                  And you haue dealt like a disloyall Knight.
               
               
                  B.
                  
                     Edward of England, these are vnkingly words,
               
               
                  King.
                  He that wil do (my Lord) what he should not,
                  Must and shall heare of me what he would not,
                  I say againe you haue deluded me.
               
               
                  Bur.
                  Am I not come according to my word?
               
               
                  K.
                  No Charles of Burgundie, thy word was giuen
                  To méete with me in Aprill, now tis August,
                  The place appointed Calice, not Lorraine,
                  And thy approach to be with martiall troupes:
                  But thou art come, not hauing in thy traine,
                  
                     
So much as Page or Lackie to attend thee,
                  As who should say thy presence were munition,
                  And strength enough to answer our expect:
                  Summer is almost spent, yet nothing done,
                  And all by dalliance with vncertaine hope.
               
               
                  Burg.
                  My forces lay before the citie Nuse,
                  
                  From which I could not rise, but with dishonour,
                  Unlesse vpon some composition had.
               
               
                  K. Ed.
                  There was no such exception in your letters.
                  Why smiles Lord Scales?
                  
               
               
                  Scales.
                  My man reports my Lord,
                  The composition that the Duke there made,
                  Was méere compulsion: for the citizens
                  Draue him from thence perforce.
               
               
                  K. Ed.
                  I thought so much:
                  We should not yet haue seene your excellence,
                  But that your héeles were better then your hands.
               
               
                  B.
                  Lord Scales, thou dost me wrong to slander me.
               
               
                  K. Ed.
                  Letting that passe, it shall be seene my Lord,
                  That we are able of our selfe to claime
                  Our right in France, without or your assistance,
                  Or any others, but the helpe of heauen.
               
               
                  Bur.
                  I make no question of it, yet the Constable
                  Prest with no such occasion as I was,
                  Might haue excusde vs both if he had pleasde.
               
               
                  K. Ed.
                  Accuse him not, your cities as we came,
                  Were euen as much to be condemnde as his,
                  They gaue vs leaue to lye within the field,
                  And scarcely would affoord vs meate for money.
                  This was small friendship in respect of that,
                  You had ingagde your honour to performe.
                  But march we forward as we were determined,
                  This is S. Quintins, where you say my Lord,
                  The Constable is readie to receiue vs.
               
               
                  Bur.
                  So much he signified to me by letter.
               
               
                  K. Ed.
                  Well we shall see his entertainment: forward.
                  
                     
As they march vpon the stage, the Lord Scales is strooke downe, and two souldiours slaine outright, with great shot from the towne.
                  Flie to our maine battaile, bid them stand,
                  Theres treason plotted: speake to me Lord Scales,

                  Two of our common souldiours slaine beside,
                  This is hard welcome: but it was not you,
                  At whom the tatall enginer did aime,
                  My breast the leuell was, though you the marke,
                  In which conspiracie answer me Duke,
                  Is not thy soule as guiltie as the Earles?
               
               
                  Bur.
                  Perish my soule, King Edward, if I knew
                  Of any such intention: yet I did, and grieue that it
                  hath sped no otherwise.

                  Howard and Sellinger?
                  Burgundie steales away.
                  What is there hope of life in none of them?
               
               
                  Ho.
                  The souldiours are both slaine outright my Lord,
                  But the Lord Scales a little is recouered.

                  Conuay his body to our Pauillion,

                  Oh God, to wooe vs first to passe the sea,
                  And at our comming thus to halt with vs,
                  I thinke the like thereof was neuer seene.
                  But wheres the Duke?

                  Gone as it seemes my Lord,

                  Greedily thrusting to begin the fight:
                  But when no longer they might be restrainde,
                  And that the drumme and trumpet both began
                  To sound warres chéerefull harmonie: behold,
                  A flagge of truce vpon the walles was hangd,
                  And forth the gates did issue méekly pac't,
                  Thrée men, whereof the Constable is one,
                  The other two the Gunner and his mate,
                  By whose grosse ouer-sight (as they report)
                  This sudden chance vnwittingly befell.

                  Enter the Constable and Howard.

                  Constable of France, we will not sell a drop
                  Of English blood, for all the gold in France:

                  It is not like but that they knew our Colours,
                  And of set purpose did this villanie:
                  Nor can I be perswaded thorowly,
                  But that our person was the mark they aimed at;

                  And therefore first shall be distributed,

                  Most puissant and most honourable King,
                  My royall master, Lewis the King of France,
                  Doth gréete your Highnes with vnfained loue,
                  Wishing your health, prosperitie, and rule,
                  And thus he saies by me. When was it séene,
                  That euer Lewis pretended hurt to England,
                  Either by close conspirators sent ouer,
                  To vndermine your state; or openly,
                  By taking armes, with purpose to inuade?
                  Nay when was it, that Lewis was euer heard,
                  So much as to detract from Edwards name?
                  But still hath done him all his due of spéech,
                  By blazing to the world his high deserts,
                  Of wisedome, valour, and his heroicke birth:
                  Whence is it then that Edward is incensoe,
                  To render hate for loue, for amitie sterne warre?
                  Not of himselfe we know: but by the meanes
                  Of some infectious counsell, that like mud,
                  Would spoyle the pure temper of his noble minde,
                  It is the Duke, and that pernicious rebell,
                  Earle of S. Paul, haue set abroach these warres,
                  
                     
Who of themselues, vnable to procéede,
                  Would make your Grace the instrument of wrong,
                  And when you haue done what you can for them,
                  You shall be sure of nothing but of this,
                  Still to be doubled and dissembled with.
                  But if it might séeme gratious in your eye,
                  To cast off these despisde consederates,
                  Vnfit companions for so great a Prince,
                  And ioyne in league with Lewis my royall master,
                  Him shall you finde as willing as of power,
                  To doe your Grace all offices of loue:
                  And what commoditie may spring thereby,
                  To both the Realmes, your Grace is wise enough,
                  Without my rude suggestions to imagine,
                  Besides, much bloodshed for this present time,
                  Will be preuented when two such personages,
                  Shall méete together to shake hands in peace,
                  And not with shock of Launce and Curtelaxe,
                  That Lewis is willing, I am his substitute,
                  And he himselfe in person if you please,
                  Not farre from hence will signifie as much.

                  First it is couenanted that Lewis King of France, according to the custome of his predecessors, shall doe homage to King Edward, King of England, as his Soueraigne and true heire to all the Dominions of France.
               
               
                  Burb.
                  How as his Soueraigne? that were to depose
                  And quite bereaue him of his Diademe,
                  Will kingly Lewis stoope to such vassallage?

                  Brother haue patience, Burbon seale your lips,
                  And interrupt not these high consequents.
                  Forward Herald, what is else demaunded?
               
               
                  Her.
                  Secondly it is couenanted that Lewis King of France, shall pay vnto Edward King of England, immediatly vpon the agréement betwixt their Maiesties, seauentie fiue thousand crownes of the sunne, toward the charge King Edward hath béen at since his arriuall in these parts of France.

                  Her.
                  Thirdly and lastly, it is couenanted, that ouer and beside those seauentie fiue thousand crownes of the sunne, now presently to be paied, Lewis King of France shal yéerely hereafter, during the life of Edward King of England, pay fiftie thousand crownes more without fraude or guile, to bee tendred at his Maiesties Castle, commonly called the Tower of London.

And to deale iustly with the world beside,
                  Knowing your title to be lineall,
                  From the great Edward of that name the third,
                  Your predecessor, thus I doe resigne,

                  K. Lew.
                  Those my Lord,
                  Shall likewise be performde with expedition,
                  And euer after, as you haue prescribde,
                  The yéerely pension shall be truly paid.
               
               
                  Her.
                  Sweare on this booke King Lewis so helpe you God,
                  You meane no otherwise then you haue said.

                  So helpe me God as I dissemble not.
               
               
                  K. Ed.
                  And so helpe he me as I entend to kéepe,
                  Vnfained league and truce with noble France:
                  And kingly brother now to consummate,
                  This happie day feast in our royall tent,
                  English and French are one, so it is meant.
               
               Exeunt.
               Enter at one dore, Burgundie chafing, with him Sellinger disguised like a souldiour; at another the Constable of France, with him Howard in the like disguise.

                  A peace concluded, saiest thou? ist not so?

                  Bur.
                  I haue found it now, the villaine Constable
                  Hath secretly with Edward thus compact,
                  To ioyne our King and him in amitie,
                  And thereby doubtlesse got into his hands,
                  Such lands and Dukedomes as I aymed at,
                  
                     
And leaues me disappointed in my hope,
                  A plague vpon such crastie cosening,
                  aside.
                  Now shall I be a marke for them to aime at,

                  Thus my Lord,
                  Your Grace demanded if the Duke were well,
                  I answere you, he is in health of bodie,
                  Though inwardly in mind somewhat perplext,
                  That you without his knowledge haue tane truce
                  With childish Lewes that hartlesse King of France.

                  K. Ed.
                  I now do vnderstand you, is it that
                  He takes vnkindly? why if he had come
                  With his expected forces as he promist,
                  I had béene still vncapable of peace,
                  But he deceiuing me, the fault was his.
               
               
                  Con.
                  No my good Lord, the fault was not in him,
                  But in that lewde pernicious counterfait,
                  That craftie Fore the Constable of France,
                  
                  Who counseld him to kéepe him at his siege,
                  Saying it would be more dishonorable
                  To rise from thence, then any way profitable,
                  
                     
To méete your Maiestie, beside my Lord,
                  It hath bin proued since, how much the Constable
                  Hates your procéedings, by that wilfull shot,
                  Was made against you from S. Quintins wals,
                  Which though he séemde to colour with faire spéech,
                  The truth is, they did leuell at your selfe,
                  And grieued when they heard you were not slaine.

                  Tell noble Edward if he will recant,
                  And fall from Lewes againe, knowing it is
                  More for his dignitie to be sole King,
                  And conquer France as did his ancestors,
                  Then take a fée, and so be satisfied,
                  That I am readie with twelue thousand soldiers

                  Faire Ladie, we did shed no drop of bloud

                  Which we poore sea men God knowes neuer heard:
                  We doubt our liues, yea though we should restore
                  Treble the value that we tooke, and more.

                  And God will pardon all my sins I trust,
                  My griefe will be for these poore harmelesse men,
                  Who thought my warrant might suborne the deed,
                  Chiefly that Gentleman that stands sadly there,
                  Who on (my soule) was but a passenger.

                  Ile bring thee to her let her vse her pleasure.

                  Against my wil I wrong her good my Lord,

                  Shall I delude my mother for a whore?

                  Alas my Lord, behold this showre of teares,
                  Which kind King Edward would compassionate,
                  Bring me not to her, she will slit my nose.
                  Or mark my face, or spurne me vnto death.
                  Looke on me Lord, can yee find in your heart?
                  To haue me spoild that neuer thought you harme?
                  O rather with your rapier runne me through,
                  Then carrie me to the displeased Quéene.

                  O hadst thou neuer broke thy how to me
                  From feare and wrong had I defended thee.

                  Am I now left alone? no millions
                  Of miseries attend me euery where:
                  Ah Mathew Shoare, how doth all séeing heauen,
                  Punish some sinne, from thy blind conscience hid?
                  Inflicting pame where all thy pleasure was,
                  And by my wife came all these woes to passe,
                  She falsde her faith, and brake her wedlocks band,
                  Her honour falue, how could my credit stand?
                  Yet will not I poore Iane on thee exclaime,
                  Though guiltie thou, I guiltlesse suffer shame.
                  I left this land too little for my griefe,
                  Returning, am accounted as a theese,
                  Who in that ship came but a passenger,
                  
                     
To sée my friends, hoping the death of her,

                  That leaue their husbands safe protections,

                  Which is not safe euen in the armes of kings:
                  Thus do I Iane lament thy present state,
                  Wishing my teares thy torments might abate.
               
               Exit.
               Enter the Queene, Marquesse Dorset leading mistrls Shoare, who fals downe on her knees before the Queene fearefull and weeping.
               
                  Qu.
                  Now (as I am a Quéene) a goodly creature,
                  Sonne how was she attended where you found her?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Madame I found her at the Marshalsea,
                  Going to visit the poore prisoners,
                  As she came by, hauing beene to take the ayre,
                  And there the keeper told me she ost deales
                  Such bounteous almes as seldome hath béene séene.
               
               
                  Qu.
                  Now before God, she would make a gallant Queene,
                  But good sonne Dorset stand aside a while.
                  God saue your maiestiomy my Ladie Shoare,
                  
                  My Ladie Shoare said I? Oh blasphemie,
                  To wrong your title with a Ladies name,
                  Queene Shoore, nay rather Empresse Shoare,
                  
                  God saue your grace, your maiesty, your highnes
                  Lord I want titles, you must pardon me:
                  What? you knéele there, king Edwards bedfellow
                  And I your subiect sit? sie, sie for shame.
                  Come take your place, &

I may take your place, you haue taken mine,
                  Good Lord that you will so debase your selfe:
                  I am sure you are our sister Queene at least.
                  Nay that you are, then let vs sit togither.
               
               
                  Iane.
                  Great Queene, yet heare me, if my sinne committed,
                  Haue not stopt vp all passage to your mercie,
                  To tel y• wrongs that I haue done your highnes,
                  Might make reuenge exceed extremitie,
                  Oh had I words or tongue to vtter it,
                  To plead my womans weaknesse, & his strength,
                  That was the onely worker of my fall.
                  Euen innocence her selfe would blush for shame,
                  Once to be namde or spoken of in this,
                  Let them expect for mercie whose offence,
                  May but be called sinne, oh mine is more,
                  Prostrate as earth, before your highnesse féete,
                  Inflict what torments you shal thinke most meet.
               
               
                  Ma.
                  Spurne the whore (mother) teare those enticing eies,
                  That robd you of King Edwards dearest loue.
                  Mangle those locks, the baits to his desires,
                  Let me come to her, you but stand and talke,
                  As if reuenge consisted but in words.

                  Sonne stand aloofe, and do not trouble me,
                  Alas poore soule, as much adoe haue I,
                  aside.
                  To for beare teares to keepe her companie.
                  Yet once more will I to my former humor.
                  Why as I am, thinke that thou wert a Queene,
                  And I as thou should wrong thy princely bed,
                  And winne the king thy husband, as thou mine:
                  Would it not sting thy soule? Or if that I
                  Being a Queen, while y• didst loue thy husband:
                  Should but haue done as thou hast done to me,
                  Would it not grieue thee? yes I warrant thee.
                  There's not the meanest woman that doth liue,
                  But if she like and loue her husband well,
                  She had rather feele his warme l

Then sée him in the armes of any Queene,
                  You are flesh and bloud as we, and we as you,
                  And all alike in our affections,
                  Though maiestic makes vs the more ambitious.
                  What tis to fall into so great a hand,
                  Knowledge might teach thée. There was once a king
                  
                     Henry the second, who did keepe his lemman,
                  Cag'de vp at Woodstocke in a Labyrinth,
                  His Quéene yet got a tricke to finde her out,
                  And how she vsde her, I am sure thou hast heard,
                  Thou art not mewde vp in some secret place,
                  But kept in Court here vnderneath my nose,
                  Now in the absence of my Lord the King,
                  Haue I not time most fitting for reuenge?
                  Faire Rosamond, she a pure virgin was,
                  Vntill the King seduc'de her to his will.
                  She wrongd but one bed, only the angry Quéenes,
                  But thou hast wronged two, mine & thy husbands,
                  Be thine owne Iudge, and now in iustice see,
                  What due reuenge I ought to take on thee.

                  Euen what you wil (great Quéen) here do I lie,
                  Humble and prostrate at your Highnesse feet,
                  Inflict on me what may reuenge your wrong,
                  Was neuer lambe abode more patiently,
                  Then I will doe. Call all your griefes to mind,
                  And do euen what you will, or how likes you,
                  I will not stirre, I wil not shrike or crie,
                  Be it torture poison, any punishment,
                  Was neuer Done, or Turtle more submisse,
                  Then I wil be vnto your chastisement.

                  I am glad to heare ye are so well resolu'de,
                  
                     
To beare the burthen of my iust displeasure.
                  She drawes foorth a knife, and making as though she meant to spoyle her face, runs to her, and falling on her knees, embraces and kisses her, casting away the knife.
                  Thus then Ile doe, alas poore soule,
                  Shall I wéepe with thée? in saith poore hart I will,
                  Be of good comfort, thou shalt haue no harme,
                  But if that kisses haue the power to kill thée,
                  Thus, thus, and thus, a thousand times ile stab thée.

                  What might haue hapt to me, I cannot tell.
                  Nay feare not, for I speake it with my hart,
                  And in thy sorrow truly beare a part.

                  There can be found such mercie in a woman,

                  In these, in me God knowes no fault at all,
                  I pardon him, though guiltie of my fall.
                  Perhaps he would, if hee had knowne twas I,
                  But twentie deaths I rather wish to die,
                  Than liue beholding for one minutes breath
                  To him, that liuing, wounded me with death.
                  Death of my ioy, and hell of my defame,

                  Here is no place quoth he, you must be gone,
                  We haue other matters now to thinke vpon.
                  For you, (quoth he to me) ant bit his lip,
                  And stroke me with his staffe, but said no more.
                  
                     
Whereby I know he meaneth me no good.

                  Time was that you did tell me otherwise,

               Enter two Apparators.

                  How now, what are you? it had béen maners
                  You should haue knockt before you had come in.
               
               
                  1. Ap.
                  We are the Bishops Parators my friend,
                  And mistris Shoare our errand is to you.
                  This day it is commanded by the King,
                  You must be stript out of your rich attire,
                  And in a white shéete go from Temple barre,
                  Untill you come to Algate, bare footed,
                  Your haire about your eares, and in your hand,
                  A burning taper, therefore go with vs.
               
               
                  Iane.
                  Euen when and whither you wil, and would to God,
                  The King as soone could ridde my soule of sinne,
                  As he may stript my bodie of these ragges.
               
               
                  2. Ap.
                  That would be soone enough, but come away,
                  And mistris Blage youle hardly answere it,
                  When it is knowne we found her in your house.
               
               
                  1. Ap.
                  It séemes you do not feare to harbour her.

                  I harbour her? out on her strumpet queane,

Ile see her hangde ere I will harbour her.
                  So now her iewels and her gold is mine,
                  And I am made at least foure thousand pound,
                  Wealthier by this match then I was before:
                  And what can be obiected for the same,
                  That once I lou'de her: well perhaps I did,
                  And women all are gouernd by the Moone,
                  But now I am of another humour,
                  Which is you know a planet that will change.

                  Attach this rebell to his Maiestie,
                  And hauing stript her to her petticoate,
                  Turne her out a dores, with this condition,
                  That no man harbour her, that durst presume
                  To harbour that lewde curtizan Shoares wife,
                  Against the strait commandement of the King.

                  Did Richard (villaine) no it was thy fault,
                  Thou wouldst be wonne to such a damned déed,
                  Which now to think on makes my soule to bléed.
                  Ah Frier Anselme, sleepe among the blest,
                  Thy propheste thus falsely did I wrest.

                  Now mistris Shoare, here our commissionends,
                  Put off your roabe of shame, for this is Algate,

                  My roabe of shame? Oh that so soule a name
                  Should be applied vnto so faire a garment,
                  Which is no more to bée condemnde of shame,
                  Then snow of putrefaction is deserude,
                  To couer an infectious heape of dung,
                  My roabe of shame, but not my shame put off,
                  For that sits branded on my forehead still,
                  And therefore in derision was I wrapt,
                  In this white Sheete: and in derision bore
                  This burning taper, to expresse my folly,
                  That hauing light of reason to direct mee,
                  Delighted yet in by-waies of darke error.

                  Welcome contempt, welcome you barren fields,
                  Welcome the lacke of meat, and lacke of friends,
                  And wretched Iane, according to thy state,
                  Sit here, sit here, and lower if might be:
                  All things that breath in their extremitie,
                  Haue some recourse of succour, thou hast none,
                  The child offended flies vnto the mother,
                  The Soldiour strucke, retires vnto his Captain,
                  The fish distressed, slides into the riuer,
                  Birds of the ayre do flie vnto their dammes,
                  And vnderneath their wings are quickly shrouded
                  Nay, beat the spanniel, & his master mones him,
                  But I haue neither where to shroud my selfe,
                  Nor any one to make my mone vnto,
                  Come patience then, and though my bodie pine,
                  Make then a banquet to refresh my soule,
                  Let hearts déepe throbbing sighs be all my bread,
                  My drink salt tears, my guests repentāt thoughts
                  That who so knew me, and doth sée me now,
                  May shunne by me the breach of wedlockes vow.

                  Lord, is my sinne so horrible and grieuous,

                  I haue sau'de the life of many a man condemnd,
                  But neuer was the death of man before.
                  That any man thus for my sake should die,
                  Afflicts me more then all my miserie.

                  I giue the frée and voluntarie oath,
                  Of their allegeance to your maiesty.
                  As to their soueraigne and liege Lord and Ladie,
                  
                     Richard the third, & beauteous Anne his Quéene,
                  The true and lawfull King & Quéene of England.

                  True Catesbie, else I nere had spoke such words,
                  aside.
                  Alas I see our kindnesse comes too late,
                  For Catesbie tels me she is dead alreadie.
               
               
                  Cat.
                  I my good Lord, so is her husband too.
               
               
                  Rich.
                  Would they had liude, to see our friendly change,
                  But Catesbie say, where dide Shoare and his wife?
               
               
                  Cat.
                  Where Aire was hangde for giuing her reliefe,
                  There both of them round circkling his cold graue,
                  And arme in arme departed from this life:
                  The people for the loue they beare to her,
                  And her kind husband, pittying his wrongs,
                  For euer after meane to call the ditch,
                  
                     Shoares Ditch, as in the memorie of them,
                  Their bodies in the Friers minorites,
                  Are in one graue enterred all together,
                  But mistris Blage for ingratitude,
                  To mistris Shoare, lies dead vnburied,
                  And no one will afford her buriall.

                  But mistris Blage she shal haue burial too,
                  What now we must be friends, indeed we must,
                  And now my Lords, I giue you all to know,
                  
                     
In memorie of our eternall loue,
                  I do ordame an order of the Bathe,
                  Twelue knights in number of that royall sort,
                  Which order with all princely ceremonies,
                  Shall be obserued in all royall pompe,
                  As Edwards our forefather of the Barter,
                  Which feast our selfe, and our beloued Quéene,
                  Will presently solemnize in our person.

                  Now am I bold to put your grace in mind
                  Of my long suite, and partly your owne promise,
                  The Earle of Herefords lands.
