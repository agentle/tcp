               The First Chapiter.
               
                  IN the Begining  of the Creation of Heauen and of Earth Gen. 1. a. and of the Garnishing of thesame · and of the Gen. 1. c. Man Adam, God opened or declared theThe Linialdissent of the Passing-ouer of the Light vpon the Earth, from the Beginning til-vnto the Ende or Perfection. First Thorowe-breaking of his true Light, vpon the Earth: and ther was not in Heauen nor on Earth nor with the Man, anymore but one Onelie Beeing of God: and thatsame, knew by the Man nothing-els but Good / same also nothing-els but Good / and did also nothing-els but Good.
               2. But now besides thissame, the Man tooke on him Gen. 3. 
                        •…
                     . to knowe that which hee knew not / to see, that hee sawe not / and to doo, that hee did not.

And thatsame which was nothing, was the Euell or Vngodlynes / which Sap. 1. b. 2. c the Man, in his Fallingaway from God, fel-vnto / wher-through also, thesame Knowledge wrought in the Man, the Euell or That which is vngodlie / because hee knewe or vnderstoode not Thatsame which is nothing, as Nothing / and sawe not into it, as Nothing: but accepted thesame for Somthing / and vnderstood or conceaued thesame Knowledge, partlie for Good / and partlie for Euell.
               3. And through thesame Science or Knowledg, the Man intermixed his Beeing and Memorie ⁏which were in all, Gen. 1. c. 2. a b. c. Good; with the Nothingnes or That which was nothing, being Gen. 3. a. b. voyde of Beeing and Life / which also was nether Nature nor Elementish / nether had it any Memorie or Vnderstanding. And That was the Euell or Vngodlynes, insteed-of ⁏or besides; ye Good or that which is Godlie / the Death, insteed of the Life / the Lye, insteed of the Trueth / the Darknes, insteed of the Light / and the disobedient Knowledg which Gen. 3. a. b. the Serpent requireth, insteed of the Obedience which God requireth: and thesame disobedient Knowledg, is the false Light / wherthrough Eccli. 37. a. the whole Worlde, is so becom repleanished with Falshod / and wherwith also the Man ⁏as consubstantiated; hath intermixed himself / and which also hath opened his Eyes, to his owne Self-seeking: and hee is ther-through becom seeing, of that which hee yetnotwithstanding sawe not / and knowing also, that which hee yet-notwithstanding knew not: and

euenso through thesame false Light of the disobedient Knowledg, Adam tooke on him ⁏against God and the Requiring of his Woord; to be Gen. 3. 
                        •…
                     . wyse and knowledgfull himself, as God: and euenso ⁏according to his taken-on Knowledg; hee knew both Good and Euell: hee sawe also Good and Euell: hee did likewise Good and Euell: and broughtfourth also Gen. 4. 
                        •…
                     . good and euell Children.
               4. See / euen-thus ther was with the Man, vpon the Earth / as-well Darknes, as Light / sowell Falshod and Deceit, as Singlemyndednes and Faithfulnes / and as-well Disobedience, as Obedience: So that by that occasion / ther was on the Earth, as-well Death, as Life: and the Children of Adam walked-fourth partlie singlemyndedlie and obedientlie, in the Light / and were inclyned Gen. 4. a. b. c to the Good: and partlie also subtillie / and deceitfull, in the Darknes / and were inclyned to the Euell: And those were the Fruites Gen. 3. a. of the Good and of the Euell / wherthrough the Iniquitie hath so ouer-measurablie 4. Esdr. 4. c. multiplyed itself euery-where, among the Children of Men.
               5. Howbeit / the Good Fruites increased them continuallie, in the Light / and in the Obedience which God requireth: and the Euell Fruites increased them continuallie, in the Darknes / and in the disobedient Knowledg, according to the Requiring of the Subtil-prudentie of the Serpent. But the Euell Fruites Gen. 5. 6. a. augmented or increased them into many Multitudes vpon the Earth: So that the Euell Fruites became many-mo
                     •…
                  , in the Darknes / 

then the Good Fruites, in the Light. And so in processe-of-time, the Euell Fruites with the subtill Knowledg in the Darknes, tooke-on to them the Dominion and Violent-power, vpon ye Earth. And it had euenso his Fourth-going or Continuaunce-of-course, till vnto Noe.
               
               6. WIth Noe God declared vpon ye Earth, the Seconde Thorowe-breaking of his true Light: and made with thesame Light, a Seperation, Gen. 6. c. 4. Esdr. 3. b. betwixt the Good and Euell Fruites / and betwixt Those that liued according to the Institution Gen. 4. e. of Seth, and were of the right Stocke of the good Beeing of God / Gen. 6. b. and Them which had corrupted the Waye of the Fleash / and liued after the Lustes of their Concupiscence / and were of the Stocke or Rase of the Wicked.
               7. Likewise, at thesame time of Noe, the Lorde destroyed all Fleash that had Gen. 6. b. 7 c corrupted his Way, in the Euell and in the Darknes. And so it became knowen and manifest / that the Feare of God, was or rested with the Gen. 9. a. b. c Good Fruites in the Light. and that ther was nothing but Feare of the Euell, with the Euell Fruites in the Darknes. And ther-out it proceeded, that the Euell / and the Degenerated frō their right Stocke, enterprised to make-them Fortresses-of-strength / and Gen. 11. a. sought their Honour and Preseruation through the Workes of their owne Handes. But God was the Strength and Preseruation of the Good.
               8. And the Euell or Degenerated from their right Stocke, 4. Isdr. 3. b. multiplyed them againe into many

Multitudes / and into manifolde Generations vpon the Earth. And the Lorde with his Good Frutes, reserued or kept vpon the Earth nomore but one Stocke or Generation Gen. 11. c. d. that feared Him / and liued according to his Lawe: and that was the Generation of Sem, out of Noe. And it had euenso hys Fourth-going, till vnto Abraham.
               
               9. WIth Abraham God declared, ye Third  Thorowe-breaking of his true Light vpon the Earth: and made with thesame Light, a Disseuering or Cleere-distinction, Gen. 12. 13. b 14. b. 17. a. b. betwixt Hys People ⁏which Hee chose vnto him as peculiar, to an holie People; / and the many-maner of People and Generations of the Heathen. And God set his Couenant betwixt Him and his People / and made therwith a Difference, betwixt his People and the vncircumcised Heathen: and God increased and multiplyed his People ؛the Seede of Abraham

                   into Gen. 35. e. 49. a. b. c. d. twelue Generations or Trybes: and they dwelled in the Gen. 47. a. b Lande of Egipt, wher they Exod. 1. a. b were heald-in-subiection by the Wicked. And it had euenso his Fourth-going, till vnto Moses, 
                  Exod. 2. a. which releassed the Seede of Abraham, from that Violent-power / Exod. 12. 13. 14. and lead them out of the Lande of Egipt.
               
               10. WIth Moses God declared, the Fourth Thorowe-breaking of his true Light, vpon the Earth. and also manifested therby, which were his Exod. 19. 20. a. b. c. Ordinaunces / Lawe / and Rites, wherin his People had alwayes liued / and who were the right Ministers of the Priestes-office of hys

Lawe. And Hee made euenso ⁏with thesame Lights a cleere Vnfolding, who they were that loued God and his Lawe or Ordinaunce / and beleeued Him. and who dispised Him & his Lawe or Ordinaunce / and beleeued not. And it had euenso his Fourthgoing, till vnto 1. Reg. 3.

And Hee made knowen and manifest with thesame Light, ye Seate of his godlie Maiestie: Also euidentlie expressed, who should buylde a Temple or Howse of hys Dwelling, 3. Reg. 5. b. 6. a. b. c. d.

               9. At which Message, the Daughters of the  Heathen Act. 13. c. were exceeding ioyfull / and gaue great Laude and Thankes ⁏with all Humilitie; to the great King ؛the Father of thesame Sonne

               11. Now when these goodlie-decked and bewtifull  Daughters of the Heathen, were thus ⁏in all Loue and Faithfulnes; maried to this most-noble Sonne of ye most-puissant King. and that they became euenso ⁏like as an vpright Espowsed-wife with her Husband; of vniforme-beeing with Him / So brought they fourth then vnto Him, manye faire Virgins and chast Daughters / and they brought them vp for Him in all Good-discipline and Honestie: and it was in like-maner promised vnto them all ⁏in their honest or verteous Bringing-vp; that they should also haue thesame noble & ritch Sonne of ye most-mightie King, to their Lord 2.

               16. NOw when that these desolate Daughters of Israel and Iuda, perceaued the vncomblie and shamefull Fornication of ye Daughters of the Heathen / and how that they greatlie polluted themselues with all Straungers / So could they not then in any-wise be perswaded, that the Maryed-husbande of the Daughters of the Heathen ⁏of whom they so bosted; was the right Sonne of the great and mightie King / which was promised in Matrymonie vnto them: but haue therfore somuch-the-more ⁏in their Ignoraunce; dispised Esa. 53. a. that noble Sonne of the great-mightie King / and iudged Him to be false. and that Hee was a Luk. 7. 15. a. Louer of Whordom and of all Vncleanenes. and could not by any meanes beleeue, that Hee was the right Lord or Husband of the Daughters of Israel and Iuda. And the Daughters of Israel and Iuda

               17. And in all this Leauing-destitute and Heauynes, they hanged or cast downe their Heads / also sighed Vide Esa: Ier: & alios Prophetas. and prayed. But so-long as they sawe not rightlie into their Offences / nor-yet acknowledged wherfore they were forsaken / so were they not pityed nor yet harkened-vnto, of their Lorde and King. but euery-wheare dispised / brought-in-distresse / and afflicted-with-greef, among all People.

               10. The Other Partie, is the Beleef & Num. 14. a Hope, to obtayne thesame by Gods Grace, through the Almightines of God and his Christ: For the Beleef knoweth that all ⁏what is vnpossible with the Man; Math. 19. d. Mark. 10. c. Luk. 18. c. is possible with God.

TO all these good and laudable Exercises ⁏O yee Elders and Fathers of Families; let your Mindes and Thoughtes stand alwayes inclined: and holde you alwayes manlie in the Wisdom, touching the Ordering and Gouernment towardes your Families and Subiectes / So shall then all those that haue intended or stoode-minded vnto Wrong and Falshod, stand-in-feare of you. but yee shall be heartelie beloued of those that loue the Righteousnes / and be likewise commended and reuerenced ⁏in your good Gouernment; of all vpright Heartes.
            
            
               The XVIII. Chapiter.
               O Yee Elders / which are becom grisell  with Age: Haue alwayes a prouident or carefull Eye, towardes your Wiues / which ⁏to becom of-mutual-beeing with

you; haue ioyned or coupled themselues with you, as Fellowe-bodies of your Bodies / to their Preseruation with you, in all Godlines: and beare alwayes a good Care ouer them: For / for that they mought be preserued with you ⁏in one Beeing of God and his Loue; yee shall nourrish and cherrish them, as your owne Bodies: for they are with you one Fleash, of your Fleash / Gen. 2. c. Math. 19. a. Mark. 10. a. and one Bone, of your Bones.
               2. Yee shall also, in all Orderlines ⁏euenlike as Yee yourselues do walke in the Lawe or Ordinance of the Lorde; keepe your Wiues submitted vnder your Lawe, Eph. 5. d. Col. 3. c. to all Obeysaunce: and nourrish and maintaine them euenso therin ⁏with all diligence; to a fourth-going of the Righteousnes.
               3. Permit them not likewise to doo or to leauevndon any-maner of thing (be it then what it is) but onlie that which is agreeable to your Lawe: and liue and walke euenso with them, in all good Gouernment and Orderlines / according to the Lawe or Ordinaunce of the Lorde.
               4. And in all this same, so loue, foster, and cherrish  your Wiues ⁏nether more nor lesse; euen as your Eph. 5. d. owne Bodies / and cleaue whollie vnto them, in Math. 19. a. Eph. 5. d. 1. Pet. 3. b. one Loue with God and his Righteousnes. For euenso ⁏to the same Conformitie-of-beeing; hath God Gen. 1. c. 2. c preordained you to be One of-vniformebeeing.
               5. Forasmuch then as that yee to-gether are but one Gen. 2. c. Eph. 5. c. Bodie / therfore yee shall not faine nor couer you before each-other. but walke alwayes openlie

and vncoueredlie ⁏in all naked Purenes; before each-other: and haue euenso a good-pleasure, in each-others Bewtie and Purenes.
               6. For God hath Gen. 2. c. created the Man in all naked Purenes or Sinceritie / and in like-maner also his Wife: and coupled them to-gether in the same naked Purenes: And vnto the same naked or vncouered pure Bewtifulnes, are wee also All ⁏through Iesus Christ and his holie Spirit of Loue; called and bidden. For-that-cause it is likewise Gods Will and Good-pleasure, that yee together ⁏which are one Man and one Wife 1. Cor. 11. b. Eph. 5. d. in the Lorde; should alwayes walke ⁏before God and before each-other; in the same naked Purenes of the godlie Fairnes · and liue euenso ⁏as one Bodie with each-other; in all Sinceere-purenes.
               7. But let the Man be the 1. Cor. 11. a. Eph. 5. c. Head / or the Lorde of the Wife / euenlike as God is the Head or the Lorde of the Man.
               8. The Wife shall not out of herself, 1. Tim. 2. c. Eph. 5. c. beare any rule or-yet haue any Maistership. but with the Man or through the Man, according to his Ordinaunce.
               9. FOr-that-cause yee shall likewise ⁏O yee  Men and Elders in the godlie Wisdom; haue a good regarde and a sharpe respect vnto your Wiues, as to marke whervnto they incline their Heartes: To your Lawe / or from your Lawe: To your Freedom / or from your Freedom.
               10. Now if yee perceaue that they incline their Heartes to your Lawe / and to your Freedom / 

so shall yee then haue also with each-other 1. Pet.

But when-as now your young Infantes, are a little growen-vp / so that they can comprehend som difference, in their Vnderstanding · and bringfourth som Reason or Wittie-deuise out of themselues / Then shall yee weane them from the Milke of their Mother / as also frō their childish Delight or Pleasure: and begin euenso then ⁏from their Youth vp; to set before their Eyes Lam. 3. b.
