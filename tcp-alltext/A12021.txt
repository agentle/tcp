               CAll heere my varlet, Ile vnarme againe,
               Why should I warre without the walls of Troy:
               That finde such cruell battell here within,
               Each Troyan that is maister of his heart,
               Let him to field Troylus alas hath none.

               The Greeks are strong and skilfull to their strength
               Fierce to their skill, and to their fiercenesse valiant,
               But I am weaker then a womans teare;
               Tamer then sleepe; fonder then ignorance,
               Lesse valiant then the Virgin in the night,
               And skillesse as vnpractiz'd infancy:

his folly sauced with discretion: there is no man hath a vertue,
that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any mā an attaint, but
he carries some staine of it. Hee is melancholy without cause
and merry against the haire, hee hath the ioynts of euery
thing, but euery thing so out of ioynt, that hee is a gowtie
Briareus, many hands, & no vse: or purblinde Argus, al eyes,
and no sight.

well the Gods are aboue, time must friend or endwell
Troylus well, I would my heart were in her body; no, Hector
is not a better man then Troylus.

               Pan:
               You haue no iudgement neece; Hellen her selfe
swore th'other day that Troylus for a b

               No, but browne.

               Faith to say truth, browne and not browne.
            
            
               Cres.
               To say the truth, true and not true.
            
            
               Pand.
               She praisd his complexion aboue Paris.
               
            
            
               Cres.
               Why Paris hath colour inough.
            
            
               Pand.
               So he has.

                     ylus should haue too much, if shee praizd
him aboue, his complexion is higher then his, hee
hauing colour enough, and the other higher, is too flaming
a praise for a good complexion, I had as lieue Helens golden
tongue had commended Troylus for a copper nose.
            
            
               Pand.
               I sweare to you I thinke Helen loues him better then Paris.

               Pand.
               Nay I am sure she dooes, she came to him th'other
day into the compast window, and you know hee has not
past three or foure haires on his chinne.

pound liste as much as his brothers Hector.

               Alas poore chin many a wart is ritcher.

               But there was such laughing, Queene Hecuba laught

               And Hector laught.

               Pan.
               Marry at the white heare that Hellen spied on Troylus
chin.
            
            
               Cres.
               And t'had beene a greene heare I should haue
laught too.
            
            
               Pan.
               They laught not so much at the heare as at his pretty
answere.
            
            
               Cres.
               What was his answere?

               In doing wrong, extenuates not wrong,
               But makes it much more heauie. Hectors opinion
               Is this in way of truth: yet nere the lesse,
               My spritely brethren▪ I propend to you
               In resolution to keepe Helen still,
               For 'tis a cause that hath no meane dependance,
               Vpon our ioynt and seuerall dignities.
            
            
               Tro.
               Why there you toucht the life of our designer
               Were it not glory that we more affected,
               Then the performance of our heauing spleenes,
               I would not wish a drop of Troy an bloud,
               Spent more in her defence. But worthy Hector,
               
               She is a theame of honour and renowne,
               A spurre to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
               Whose present courage may be ate downe our foes,
               And fame in time to come canonize vs,
               For I presume braue Hector would not loose
               So rich aduantage of a promisd glory,
               As smiles vpon the fore-head of this action,
               For the wide worlds reuenew.
            
            
               Hect.
               I am yours,
               You valiant offspring of great Priamus,
               
               I haue a roisting challenge sent amongst
               The dull and factious nobles of the Greekes,
               VVill shrike amazement to their drowsie spirits,
               I was aduertizd, their great generall slept,
               VVhilst emulation in the armie crept:
               This I presume will wake him.
               Exeunt.
               
                  
How now Thersites? what lost in the Labyrinth of thy
furie? shall the Elephant Aiax carry it thus? he beates me,
and I raile at him: O worthy satisfaction, would it were
otherwise: that I could beate him, whilst hee raild at mee:

Achilles, Achilles is my Lord, I am Patroclus knower,
