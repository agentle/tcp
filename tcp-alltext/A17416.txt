            TO THE
TRVELY RELIgious,
and his most affectionate
frend, Mistris
Iane Ratclife, wife to Mr.
Iohn Ratclife, Esquier,
Alderman and Iustice of
peace, late Maior
of the Citie of
Chester,
            
               PEace be vnto
you and
loue, with
faith from
God the father, and the
Lord Iesus Christ. The

impertunitie, of diuerse
of my hearers, and the expectation
of many of all
sorts, together with my desire
to yeeld some account
of my long vndelightfull
leasure, haue inclined me
to prepare some of my
publike and priuate labours,
for the common
view: hoping that the abounding
respect of my
friends will couer the
wants, and weakenesses
which other men will sooner
espie. Howsoeuer I
haue long meditated, a
worke of greater labour,
then this ensuing treatise
yet in the meane time I

haue beene willing to tast
the approbation of good
men, and make my best
aduauntage of the censures
of the many minded
multitude, by aduenturing
to send foorth these
first fruites, as a handfull
gathered out of the rest.
            
               Worthie Gentlewoman,
there are manie
reasons induce me to publish
these signes vnder
your name, your singular
loue and liking of my ministerie,
together vvith
your reuerent and willing
entertainement, of faithfull
Ministers (receiuing
them as the messengers of

the Churches, and the glorie
of Christ as partners
and fellow helpers, walking
in the same spirit)
challengeth from vs some
publike testimonie of our
acknowledgemēt of Gods
grace, and of the ioy,
vvherewith vve reioyced
for your sake; besides constant
indeauour to make
vse of all opportunities
for your resolution, and
direction, in the seuerall
conflicts, and cases of
your conscience. I haue
had occasion fully to know
your order, and manner
of life, your desires, purposes,
teares, & vprightnes,

your faith, your loue,
your obedience: and therfore
being assured, that
you are marked euen
with euerie one of these
signes; vvhy should I not
say vnto you, as somtimes
Iob said of himselfe.Iob 31. 35 
               
                  Behold
your signes that
the Almightie wil witnesse
for you.
                And I am
vvell assured, that this
treatise vvill finde good
accesse vnto the hands
and hearts of diuers in
these parts, euen for the
loue they beare to you, and
for the good they novv
heare you haue by experience
reaped from

these. Neither had I beene
easily drawne to publish
these, but that hauing occasion
in conference with
many to make vse of thē,
I could hardly satisfie
them vvith coppies. I
spare to alleadge other
reasons.
            Novv vvhat remains
but that I should beseech
you, and all those vvho
finde by these signes the
assurance of Gods eternal
loue, euen to honour the
Lord vvith the continuall
sacrifices of praise, the
fruite of your lips,Heb. 13 vvith
confession to his name, oh
loue the Lord vvith your

whole heart, and make
his praise glorious, and abound
more and more, in
the fruites of sincere life,
and in all holy, and humble
conuersation, liue by
faith, and in nothing be
carefull,Phil. 4, 6 but in all things,
let your requests he made
knowne to God, vvith
thanksgiuing: and as you
haue receiued mercy faint
not, neither be descoraged
vnder the sence of your
infirmities and vvants,2, Cor, 4, 1
for they that vvaite vpon
the Lord,Esa. 40, 31 shall renevv
their strength, the Lord
vvill power his spirit vpon
your seede, &Isa, 44, 4 his blessing

vpon your buds: the
sunne of righteousnesse
vvill arise, and there is
healing vnder his wings.
You haue a high Priest,Ma. 
                     •
                  4, 2
that is touched vvith infirmities,Hob. 5. 15 16 and therefore
you may goe boldly to the
throne of grace, to seeke
grace and mercy to helpe
in time of neede: the power
of God is made knowne
in vveakenesse,2 Cor. 12 and his
grace will be sufficient:
the Lord keepeth the feete
of his Saints,1. Sam. 2, 9 and vvill
supplie all your vvants
vvith his riches in glory.Psa. 66, 8, 9
Blessed be the Lord that
holdeth our soules in life,

and suffereth not our
fee
                  •
               e to be moued.
            Gracious gentlewoman
be confident in this,Psa. 1, 6 that
God which hath begun
his good worke will performe
it, till the day of
Christ▪ for his foundation
remaineth sure:2. Tim. 2, 19. and hee
euer liueth that maketh
intercession for you,Heb. 7, 25 and
the mortall seede abideth,1. Ioh. 3, 9
and Christ will be,Reu. 21. 6 
               Omega
as well as Alpha, the
end as well as the beginning:
neither feare the
reproach of men, for there
is a hiding place with the
Lord,Psa. 31, 20 from the strife of
tongues; and he will put

to silence those lying lipps
that speake such grieuous
things,Psal, 31, 18 so proudly, so contemptuously:
vvaite on
the Lord, and keepe his
waie; they shall assuredly
make an account to the
Iudge of quicke and dead,1. Pet▪ 4, 5
that speake euill of the innocent,
And the same
God and father of mercie
that hath directed, your
heart vnto his loue, and
refreshed your spirit with
the vnspeakeable ioies of
his presence, finish his
owne worke in you: and
as you haue professed, a
good profession before
many that will witnesse,

how vnblameably you
haue behaued your selfe
among them that beleeue;
so stand fast in the Lord,
be stil an example of faith
and puritie, of loue and
feruencie, of meekenesse,
and humilitie, of tendernesse,
and harmelesnesse,
of shamefastnesse, and sobrietie,
of mercie and
good workes, as becommeth
a woman professing
godlinesse, that they may
bee ashamed which shall
falsely accuse your good
conuersation in Christ,
keepe the Doctrine you
haue receiued, seeing you
haue learned Christ, as

the tr
                  •
               th is in him. Striue
to increase in loue and obedience
to your husband
and care of your chrildren
& familie, and shew
all faithfulnesse, and diligence
in your particular
calling. Prouoke your kindred
and acquaintance
vnto repentance, faith,
praier, loue, fellowship in
the Gospell, and good
workes, that thanksgiuing
may be giuen by many
to God for you. Let
the word of Christ bee
still your guide: watch
vnto praier, receiue them
that feare God, and make
much of such. Let patience

haue her perfect
worke, and commit your
waies to God, and trust
in him. The Lord make
you to abound in loue yet
more and more, in knowledge,
and in all iudgement,
that you may still
approue things that are
excellent, and be blamelesse
in the middest of a
crooked & peruerse people:
the Lord perfect in
you whatsoeuer is vvanting,
and fulfill the good
pleasure of his goodnesse,
and the worke of your
faith with power. The
Lord increase in you that
holy couetousnesse, to be

with the Lord, looking
for the blessed hope, and
glorious appearing of the
great God, and our Sauiour
Iesus Christ.
            Farewell.

            A SHORT
Treatise concerning
Assurance.
            
               COncerning
the assuraunce
of
Gods fauour,
three things may
be considered of. First
the proofes. Secondly,
the Lets. Thirdly, the
signes.
            
               That a Christian in
this life may be infallibly
assured of Gods fauour

to himself in particular,
and that hee
ought to seeke this assurance,
as a matter of
singular necessity, these
places of Scripture
proue. The Apostle
Paul chargeth the Corinthians
to Examine
themselues,
                  2. Cor. 13. 5. 
                  whether they
be in the faith, and requireth
this prouing of themselues
with such earnestnesse,
that he saith, know
yee not your owne selues,
how that Christ Iesus is
in you, except ye be reprobates?
As if he would
auouch it, that a man
can neuer haue found

comfort of his election
till he get this assured
knowledge of Gods fauour
in Christ. And
the Apostle Peter exhorts
Christians to vse
all diligence to make
their calling and election
sure whatsoeuer carnall
persons speake against
it.2. Pet. 1. 10. 
                  Iob vehemently
desires there were a
perpetual record of his
words, when he speaks
of his assurance, that
no man might thinke
he spake passionately,
or vainegloriously;Iob. 19. 23. 25. 26. 27. 
                  He
knew that his redeemer
liued, and that at the last

day, his very flesh should
be raised, & he should see
God with ioy. By the spirit
of God a Christian
knowes the things of
God:1. Cor. 2. 10. 11. 12. 
                  yea to this end haue
we receiued this Spirit
which is of God, that wee
might know the things
which are freely giuen vs
of God: yea it searcheth
the deepe things of
God.2. Cor. 5. 1 And in the second
of the Corinthians Gods
children are said to
know their glorification:
as certainely as by
sence and experience,
they know, that their
bodies, which are their

earthlie tabernacles
shall bee dissolued: so
certainely are they assured
of the building
of God, not made with
hands,2. Cor. 5. 6. 8. eternall in the
heauens: yea they are
alwaies confident herein;
and therefore Gods
seruant are taught to
pray for the spirit of
wisdome and reuelation,
that the eyes of
their vnderstanding
may bee inlightned,
that they might know
the hope of their calling,
and the riches of
their inheritance,Eph. 1. 18. 19. and
the exceeding greatnes

of Gods power towards
them, vpon this
assurance. Paul knowes
whom hee hath beleeued,
and no afflictions
should hinder him,2. Tim. 1. 12.
but he will settle, vpon
this perswasion, that
God will keepe his
soul, which he hath cō
                  mitted
to him against
the day of Christ. The
Apostle Iohn saith,1. Ioh. 3. 14 
                  We
know that we haue passed
from death to life,
                  1. Ioh. 5. 13
And again,1. Ioh. 5 19 
                  ye may know
that ye haue eternall life.
And again we know that
wee are of God. And the
Apostle to the Ephesians
                  
saith,Eph. 3. 11. that in Christ
we haue boldnesse and accesse,
with confidence by
faith in him: yea the very
words of assurance
are found in Scripture
where it is shewed,1. Thos. 1. 5 that
we may haue much assurance,Heb. 10. 22.
yea full assurance,Col. 2. 2.
yea the riches of
full assurance: and men
are earnestly exhorted,Heb. 6. 11
to vse all diligence to
get this full assurance
to the end; and when
it is once had, neither
death, nor life, nor Angels,
nor principalities,
nor things present, nor
things to come, nor

height, nor depth,Rom. 8. 38. 39. nor
anie other creature
should be able to seperate
them from▪ this
loue of God in Iesus
Christ.
            
            
               Lets,
               THe attainment
of the sence,
power, & comfort
of this assurance
is exceedingly hindered
in all sorts of people.
 First, For many can
neuer attaine it, beecause
they are forestalled
with euill opinions
about it, they thinke it

is impossible to be had,
or it is needelesse, or it
is presumption to seek
it, or it would prooue
a nurse to security if it
were had. Secondly, in 
the most, common
hope serues the turne
and supplies presumptuously
the roome of
this sacred gift, Thirdly,
many heare & professe,
and goe farre in
the opinion of others,
and yet get not assurance;
because they
take not a soūd course
for the mortification of
the body of sinnes that
are passed, whereas it

is certain assurance can
neuer be had, till there
be some sound course
taken, in the acknowledgement,
bewailing,
and reformation of
 them. Fourthly, besides
a barraen life is an vncomfortable
and vnsetled
life,1. Cor. 15. 58. and contrariwise
to abound in
Gods worke, hath stedfastnesse,
and a secret
rest of heart, as an vnspeakeable
companion
 of it. Fifthly, Melancholy
also (that is terrors
and griefes, of which
a man can yeelde no
true reason) is in diuers

a mighty let to the setled
assurance they
might haue. They are
so eaten vp with those
strong conceits that all
the comfort is propounded
most anend,
prooues as water spilt
vpon the ground: especially
when this humor
is nourished by some
extraordinary distemper
of the body; Physicke,
not arguments of
Scripture must here be
vsed, or rather both of
them. Sixthly, the loue
of earthly things is another
great impediment:
many professors

haue their thoughts
and cares so eaten vp
with worldlinesse, that
they cannot seriously
hold out to follow
the directions requisite
to the attainement
of assurans. This grace
requires a minde some
way fitted for contemplation.
It is a knowledge
will neuer be had
with looking downeward.
 Seuenthly, further,
many are so passionate
and froward,
they can get no rest in
their heart, when as ful
assurance would bee
lodged in an humble

& quiet brest. Eighthly,
Others want assurance,1. The. 1. 5
because they
neglect the meanes of
assurance,Eph. 1. 17 which are
the word,Phi. 15, 6 praier, or
fellowship in the Gospell.
Ninthly, In some
there lodgeth some secret 
sinne vnrepented
of, and this either
keepes out faith, or
keepes it downe in the
cradle, that it can get
no strength. Lastly, assurance 
is the gift of
God, and hee bestoweth
it on whom hee
will.
            
            
               
               The signes generally
propounded.
               THere are sixteene
infallible
signes of a child
of God, as may appeare
by the testimonie
of most apparent
Scripture.
               First,Mat. 5. 3. 
                  Pouerty of spirit;
for the poore of spirit
are blessed and theirs
is the kingdome of
heauen.
               Secondly,2 Cor. 7. 10. 
                  Godly sorrow,
for it causeth repentance,
not to be repented
off, euen such a

repentance as is vnto
saluation.
               Thirdly, the loue of the
word, for this is a sure
comfort in affliction,Pal. 119. 50.
and may quicken a
mans heart,2 Cor. 2. 15. this is a sauour
of life vnto life,
in them that are saued.
               Fourthly, The loue of
Gods children;
                  1. Ioh. 3. 14. for hereby
we know wee are
passed from death to
life,1. Cor. 13. 1. 2. 3. because wee loue
the brethren.
               Fifthly, Faith; for
god so loued the world
that hee gaue his onely
begotten sonne, that
whosoeuer beleeueth

in him, should not perish
but haue euerlasting
life.
               Sixthly, Vprightnesse
of heart:
                  Psal. 84. 13. 1. for God
will giue grace and glorie,
and no good thing
will hee with-hold
from them that are vpright
in heart.Psa. 97. 11
               
               Seuenthly, The spirit
of Adoption.
                  Rom. 8. 9. 14. 16. For it
beareth witnes to our
spirit that wee are the
sonnes of God: and if
anie man haue not the
spirit of Christ, he is
not his.
               Eighthly, Holy desires.
For euery one

that thirsteth,Reuel. 21. 6 shal haue
of the water of life freely:
& if they will heare,Esay 55. 1, 2 3, 4.
their soules shall liue,
and enioy the sure mercies
of Dauid, they are
blessed,Mat. 5, 6. and they shall
be satisfied.
               Ninthly, The spirit
of praier or supplication;
                  Io
                        •
                     l. 2, 22
for whosoeuer calleth
on the name of
the Lord shall bee saued.Zach. 12. 10.
               
               10 The obedience of
Christ,
                  Heb. 5. 9. for he is the author
of eternall saluation
to them that obey
him.
               11 Sauing knowledge

For this is eternall
life, to know God,
and whom hee hath
sent Iesus Christ.Ioh. 17. 3. It is
not onely a signe of eternall
life or saluation,
but the beginning
and part of it.
               12 The Sacraments
in the right vse of them
are infallible signes of
our saluation, and to
that end ordained,Mar. 16. 11 for
he
                     •
                   that belieueth and
is baptised shall bee saued.1. Pet. 3. 21
Hence it is said,
Baptisme saueth vs:
they are sure seales of
the righteousnesse of
faith.Rom. 4. 11
               
               
                  
13 The loue of God:
for if a man loue Christ
the Father will loue
him,Ioh. 14. 23 and come vnto
him and dwell with
him.
               14 The feare of God:
for it is a fountaine of
life,Pro. 14. 27 to depart from the
snares of death.
               15 Loue of our enemies:
                  Mat. 5 44. 48.
for it is not onely
a signe of a Christian,
but of a perfect
Christian.
               16 Desire of death.
                  2. Tim. 4.
For a crowne of life is
layed vp for all them
that loue the appearing
of Christ.
            
            
               
               The signes particularly
expounded;
and first of pouertie
of Spirit.
               SPirituall pouertie
may bee tried either
by properties,
or by effect.
               Gods poore haue
eight properties.
               First, They are sensible,
and that first of
their owne wants and
misery, by nature and
daily sinne. Secondly,
they know when they
see Gods iudgements,Zach. 11. 11.
that it was the word of

the Lord. Thirdly,
they tremble at Gods
word,Esay 66. 2. and feare his displeasure,
while it yet
hangs in the threatning.
Fourthly, they are
sensible of that speciall
goodnesse of Gods
mercy;Psal. 109. 20. when a man is
poore and needie, he
can say with Dauid,
mercie is good.
                  Psal. 109. 21. Fifthly,
they are sensible of
their owne mortalitie:
they haue feeling impressions
of their fading
condition.
               Secondly, they are
thankfull, and that for
lesser mercies; a poore

man is glad of a pennie,
whereas a rich man
cannot bee touched
with so small a fauour,
Gods poore will praise
Gods name for the very
crums that fals from
his table: and as anie
are more poore and
humble, they are more
thankefull.
               Thirdlie, they are
teachable, and willing
to bee appointed and
instructed; it is a great
signe a mans heart is
not humble, when he
must haue so much to
doe, before he can bee
perswaded to anie

trueth, or disswaded
from anie sinne: pride
and ignorance is hard
to learne.
               Fourthly, they are
hungrie people, especially
greedie after the
food in Syon,Psal. 12. 26 & 132. 15 they
loue it, they desire it,
they esteeme it, they
are satisfied with nothing
better then with
it, it is the reliefe of
their hearts foreuer.
            
            
               And there are fiue effects
of spirituall properties.
               THe first is praier:
for Gods poore

liue by begging, if hee
be poore, hee will crie
vnto God.
               The second is Abnegation:
for this poore
man, renounceth his
owne merits, hee seeth
no good will be had by
deseruing; for hee deserueth
nothing but
Gods curse in al things
hee forsaketh also the
world, both in the lusts
of it, and in the companie
of the wicked, and
all earthly things, as not
hauing the chiefe good
in them.
               The third is diligence
in Gods worke;

yea Gods poore are
willing to do the meanest
and hardest worke
God will be pleased to
set them to: so as they
may finde fauour in
his eies to be accepted
with him, they would
account no worke too
base for them to doe,
but they would bee
glad to doe anie thing
they could with their
best desires and endeavours.
               Fourthly, Gods
poore,Pal. 11. 14 commit themselues
& all their waies
to Gods care and mercie;
they will onely

trust in the name of
the Lord,Zeph. 3. 12 and bee contented
to let God dispose
of them as pleaseth
him.
               Fifthly, The last is
a feare to offend God
in word or deede, by
their good will they
would doe none iniquitie,Zech. 3. 13
nor speake lies,
a deceitfull tongue
should not be found in
their mouth, Gods
poore and Gods Turtle
doues are all one;Psal. 74. 19 so
in seperable are harme
lesse innocencie and
spirituall pouertie.
            
            
               
               2. Godlie sorrow.
               WEE may
know whetther
our
sorrowes be Godly, if
we consider. First, the
causes. Secondly, the
properties. Thirdly the
concomitants. Fourthlie,
the effects of them.
               For the first of them
wee must consider
what raiseth our sorrowes
and what asswageth
them, for godlie
sorrow, is chiefelie raised
for sinne: and so

for the sinnes of the
time, because others
keepe not the law. For
Ezechiel doubt not to
mark them with Gods
marke,Ezech. 9. 4 that mourne
for the abhomination
done in Ierusalem;Psa. 119. 36. but
wee must vnderstand
that this sorrow must
bee simple, because
God is dishonored.
               And further in sorrow
for our owne sins,
we must mourne, for al
sorts of sinnes, for lesser
sines, as well as greater,Esay 6. 5.
for sinnes of our
calling, for secret sins
as well as open, for sins

that presntlie trouble
vs, as well as for sinnes
past:Rom 7. for the sins feared
and the corrupt inclination
of our natures,
for beeloued,Esay 1. 16
gainefull and pleasing
sinnes, finally for the euill
of our good works
as wel as for euil works.
Now there are two
notes of great vse, in
triall of sorrow for our
sinnes; the one is, that
wee must sorrow for
sinne as it is sinne; and
the other is, that a man
should not easily satisfie
himselfe in the measure,
till he can mourne

as much for sinne, as
he was wont, or now
would for losses. The
Prophet Zacharias instanceth,Zac. 12. 10. 11.
when he saith;
the spirit of God, shold
cause them to mourne
as in the familie, as one
would mourne for the
losse of their onely
sonne, or as in the common
wealth, the subiects
would doe, for
the losse of a most worthie
Prince. He mentioneth
their sorrow for
Iosiah, yet wee must
know that teares are
not of necessitie, and
specially in such natures,

as are voide of
teares, for anie other
causes.
               Secondly, in asmuch
as sorrow may be Godly
euen for iudgements
wee must vnderstand
that herein our triall
wil be,Psal. 4
                        •
                     , 3. 2 137. if we can mourn
rather for spirituall
iudgements,Neh 1. 3
                        •
                      4 then for
temporall: and among
the rest, if we can feele,
and bewaile hardnesse
of heart,Esay 63. 17 mourning because
we cānotmourne
as we ought, and farther
if we can be grieued
as well for the offence
of God as for punishment.
               
                  
Thirdly, a christian
is principally stirred vp
in true sorrow, by the
sence of Gods goodnesse;
so as nothing
doth more fire him to
a desire to abase himselfe
and to humble
himselfe, euen in the
verie dust, in the sence
of his owne vilenesse,
then to feele and finde
the gracious goodnes
and readinesse of God
to shew mercie.Hos. 3. 
                  He feareth
the Lord and his
goodnesse.
               
               And as godlie sorrow
is raised by spirituall

meanes and considerations,
so it is asswaged
onely by spirituall
meanes, those sorrowes
that can be healed
by sports, merrie
companie or the like,
are much like the medecines
vsed to helpe
them; but in godlie
sorrow,Ho. 6. 1. 3. the same God
that wounded them
must heale, and a christiā
desires helpe from
the same word that
pierced him.
            
            
               Thus of the causes.
               THere are foure
properties of godly

sorrow which among
the rest, we must
labour after, and without
which we can hardlie
haue true assistance,
that our sorrowes are
right.
               First, it is inquisitiue,
it is a hard thing
to make sorrow silent,
and hee that is truelie
pricked in his heart,Ior. 50. 4. 5
cannot with contentment
smother his
doubts, hee will aske
the way to Sion, and
cannot rest till he haue
knowne what to doe
to be saued,Act. 2. 37. those that
finde so little to aske,

and can be so silent in
the presence of Gods
seruaunts, by whom
they might bee directed,
may suspect their
sorrowes.
               Secondlie, it must
not rest in the beginnings,
or probabilities,
or hopes, or others
good opinions, or the
mending of manie
things: but a Christian
that is truelie humbled
will repent stil,Ier. 31. 19 though
he haue turned, that is,
he is so fearefull of being
deceiued, through
the corruption of his
owne heart, and the

wils of Sathan, that he
will constantlie hold
on to confesse and bewaile
his sinnes, till he
may finde assured rest
vnto his soule.
               Thirdlie, it will admit
nothing against
God, but it makes a
man condemne himselfe,
rather then God;
when Dauid lay in that
mournfull plight, that
he could finde no comfort
night nor daie,Psa. 77. 1. 2▪ 27▪
                   for
a long season, and that
the question, was to be
debated whether God
had forgotten to bee
mercifull, &c. Hee resolues,

the fault was
in himselfe that it was
his infirmitie, and that
his soule refused comfort.
               Fourthlie, it will not
rest without cleanenesse,
godlie sorrow is
not water, but washing
nor euery washing, but
such as maketh cleane:Esay 1. 16▪
                  
worldlie sorrow may
haue much water, but
cleanseth nothing, but
godlie sorrow greatlie
desireth and loueth
puritie.
               Thus of the causes
and properties concerning
the concomitants

there are diuerse things
doe accompanie godlie
sorrow, by which it
is discerned; for,
               First it is ioyned with
a secret trust in the acacceptation
of God, so
as no miserie can beate
them from the consideration
and inward
affiance of hope of
mercie, in the verie
disquietnesse of the
heart the desire of the
soule is to the Lord,Psa. 38. 9. &
before his presence
though a childe of
God, be neuer so much
cast downe, yet hee
waits vpon God, for

the helpe of his countenaunce,Psa. 42. 5. 11.
and in some
measure condemnes
the vnbeliefe of his
owne heart, and supporteth
himselfe with
the hope of the neuer
failing compassions of
God:Tam 3. 21 thus it differs
from the sorrowes of
Caine and Iudas.
               
               Secondlie, it is ioined
with a wonderfull
loue of God for hearing
of praier, it is most
deepelie affected with
euerie mercie of God
felt in praier; Dauid
loues the Lord,Psa. 116. 13. because
he hath heard his praier

at that time when
his sorrowes was as the
paines of hell.
               Thirdlie,Psa. 119. 20. 82. 33. it is ioined
with a longing after the
word.
               Fourthlie, it is ioined
with a constant desire
to glorifie God by a
fruitefull profession, euerie
one that truelie
mourneth in Sion,Esay. 61. 2 3. is a
tree of righteousnesse,
the planting of the
Lord, that he may bee
glorified.
               Fifthlie, it is ioined
with a spirit of supplications,
sorrow that is
after God, will teach a

Christian to pray, that
could neuer praie before;
the spirit of compassion,Zac. 12. 10
is a spirit of
supplication.
               Lastlie, our sorrowes
must be tried by their
effects, for godlie sorrow.
               First, driues vs to a
dailie and serious confession
of sinne in particular
without hiding
anie sinne.Psa. 38. 17
               
               Secondlie, it breedes
a tender sence of the
burthen of sinne; neuer
doth a Christian
feele the heauie loade
of sinne as it is sinne,

till God hath softned
his heart by his spirit.Psal. 38. 5.
               
               Thirdlie, It workes
a mindefulnesse of
God and his presence,Psal. 42. 6.
and a deepe impression
and thought of good
things.
               Fourthlie,Psa. 51. 17 it causeth
a man to sacrifice and
deuote himselfe to
God.Rom. 12. 1
               
               Fifthlie, it breedes
sensiblenesse & thankfulnesse
for all sorts of
mercie.Lam. 3. 22 23.
               
               Lastlie, the Apostle
notes seuen effects of
Godlie sorrow,2. Cor. 7. 11. care, apologie,
indignation,

feare, vehement desire,
zeale and reueuge.
            
            
               3. Loue to the word.
               IN so much as wicked
men; especiallie
such as are indued
with a temporary faith
may haue some kinde
of affections to the
word, we must carefullie
trie our selues, and
examine our selues seriously.
               1.Ps. 119. 20 Whether we desire
it as our appointed
foode constantlie?Iob. 23. 12.
               
               2. Whether wee
loue them that loue

the word.
               3.Psal. 119. 115. Whether the
loue of the word seperates
vs from the wicked?
               4. Whether we can
mourn,Psal. 119 136. because others
keepe not the word?
               5. Whether wee
loue it aboue all riches
and could esteeme it
as our heritage?Psa. 119. 14. 72. 111
               
               6. Whether it bee
our chiefe comfort in
affliction.Psa. 119. 23 24. 50. 51. 54. 143
               
               7. Whether in hearing
wee receiue it as
the word of God,1. Thes. 2. 13. and
not of men.
               8. Whether we receiue

it in power and
much assurance?1. The, 1. 5
               
               9. Whether it workeIoh. 8. 33.
effectually in vs theredressePsa. 119. 45. 9. 59.
of our waies and
freedome from the
bondage of sinne.1. Thes. 2. 13.
               
               10. Whether wee
loue all the words of
God, euen the law that
with threatning shews
vs our sinnes as well as
the gospell;Psal. 1. 2 & 119. 11. desiring to
hide the word in our
hearts that wee might
not sinne.
               11. Whether it be
our desire and delight
to exercise our selues
in it day and night.Psa. 
                        •
                     . 1
               
               
                  
12. Whether wee
can accompt and feele
the famine of the word
to bee a most bitter
crosse.Psa. 42. 3.
               
               13. Whether wee
could bee contented
constantlie to labour
for it,Amos. 8. as men doe, for
the foode that perisheth.12. Ioh. 6. 27.
               
               14. Whether wee
finde a constant sweete
taste in it,Psa. 19. 10. especially in
the powerfull preaching
of it.
               15. Whether for
the gospell sake we can
bee content,Mar. 10. 2. 9. to denie
our reasons,1. Cor. 3. 18. affections,

credits,1. Thes. 1. 5. 6. carnall friends
pleasures and profits.
            
            
               4. The loue of
Gods children.
               OVr loue to the
Saints may be
tried. First, by
the cause. Secondly, by
the extent. Thirdly, the
manner. Fourthly, by
the effects.
               For the first, to loue
Gods children,Psa. 16. 2. 3. because
they are begotten of
God,1. Ioh. 3. and for the grace
of Gods spirit,14 & 5. 1. by
which they resemble
God (or rather for the

Lord himselfe desiring
to expresse our affections
to them, because
wee doe no good to
God himselfe) is not
found in anie reprobate,
and so to loue
them simplie for the
truths sake, whereas to
loue them for beautie,
profit,2. Ioh. 1. 2. companie sake,
or any naturall or carnall
reasons or ends in
no signe at all.3. Ioh. 1.
               
               Secondlie, hee that
truely loues the brethren,
loues all the brethren;Eph. 1. 15.
hee that loues
not all the Saints,Col. 1. 4. loues
no Saint aright:Phile. 5. a true

Christian hath not the
glorious faith of Christ
in respect of persons,
he loues the poorest, if
he haue true grace, aswell
as the richest,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   yea
he loues the absent aswell
as the present, yea
he loues for the truths
sake those he neuer saw
yet this hinders not
the difference of degrees
of loue, so as some
may be more beloued
then others, and that
by reason of the greater
measure of Gods
gifts and graces, or els,
by the speciall prouidence
of God when

the Lord linketh the
affection of some Christians
in some speciall
eminencie of respects;
and so it is not alwaie
needefull, that the persons
most loued, bee
most gracious; it doth
not of necessitie follow
that Iohn was the
most gracious of al the
Apostles, though hee
were most beloued.
               Againe as our loue
must bee extendent to
all saints, so also must it
be to all times, we must
loue them aswell when
they are in aduersity,
disgrace, temptation,

sicknesse, or any misery;
as when they abound
in prosperitie or good
estimation, &c.
               For the third,
this loue is without
dissimulation,1, Ioh. 3, 18, 19. it is indeede
and trueth,Rom, 12, 9, 10. not
in word or appearance
onely. And besides, it is
a most affectionate
and brotherly loue.
               Lastlie, there are
sixe effects of true christian
loue, for it shewes
it selfe.
               First, by honor, and
this honoring of them
that feare the Lord,Psa, 15, 4
                        •
                     
                     ▪
                  
hath in it▪
               
               
                  
First, an estimation
of them, as the
onely excellent people
in the world.Psa. 16. 3
               
               Secondly,Rom. 16 19. a free acknoweledgement
of
their iust praises in all
places,3. Ioh. 6. for their grace
and obedience.1. Thes. 18.
               
               Thirdly,1. Thes. 1. 7. a willing
proposing of them, as
examples to imitate.
               Fourthly,1. Pet. 4. 8 a holy endeauour
to couer their
infirmities, taking
things in the best part
and sence, not receiuing
disgracefull reports
of them;1. Cor. 13. 4, 5, 6, 7. suffering
long, not vau
                     •
                  ting

themselues in comparison
of them, not easily
prouoked, not enuying
them, hoping all
things, induring all
things, and yet not reioycing
in their iniquity.
               Fiftly, Apology for
them against the reproches
and scornes of the
world.
               Sixthly by delight
in their fellowship,Psal. 16. 3. and
society in the Gospell,Phil. 1, 5.
in which respect they
can be equall to them
of the lower sort.3. Ioh. 8. Such
as finde no need of,Rom. 12, 16 nor
delight in the company

of Gods children,
or are willing to sort
with none, but their
betters or equals, may
see great cause to bee
humbled, either for
the want of this grace,
or for the weakenesse
of it.
               Thirdly, by simpathy
and fellow-feeling▪
for in some measure,Rom 12. 9. 16 a
childe of God is like
affectioned: He can in
some measure weepe
with them that weepe,3 Ioh. 3
and reioyce with them
that reioyce, especially
they reioyce, to heare,
or know their soules

prosperity.
               Fourthly,Psal. 16, 3. by weldoing,
& mercy,Rom. 12 10, 13. this loue
is bountifull,Phile. 7, 1. Pet. 3, 8. & 4, 8. pittifull,
tender, hath bowels
both of spirituall and
outward mercy,1. Ioh. 3, 17. it gladly
receaueth the saints,3. Ioh 5
it communicates to
their necessitie willinglie,
and with a readie
minde.
               Fiftly, by a desire to
walke in offensiuely,
he that loueth his brother,1. Ioh. 
                        •
                     . 10
there is no occasion
of stumbling, or
scandall in him.
               Lastly, the true loue
of Gods children, will

make a man grow vpEphe. 4, 15, 16.
the faster into Iesus
Christ,1. Thes. 3. 12, 13. in all grace and
holinesse.1▪ Ioh. 5, 2.
               
            
            
               5. Faith.
               INasmuch, as there
are diuers kinds of
faith, and experience
shewes in many
that giue no signes of
repentance, that they
will not bee beaten
from a confident perswasion,
that Christ died
for them, euen for
them in particular. It
stands vs in hand to try
our perswasion by the

true rules of scripture,
and if it will abide the
triall of the touchstone,
we may lay it vp
as hid treasure, and a
wonderfull grace of
God, and if otherwise
we may repent of presumption,
as a deceaueable
sinne.
               
                  Faith may be tried.

                     1. By the Cause.
                     2. By the Properties.
                     3. By the Concomitants.
                     4. By the effects.
                  
               
               For the first, true
faith commeth by the
hearing of the word

preached: It is no naturall
endowment, nor
gotten by naturall
helpes; But first is
wrought by the holyghost,
in the preaching
of the Gospell, as is
plaine by the Apostle.
How shal they beleeue
in him of whom they
haue not heard,Rom. 10, 14. and
how shall they heare
without a Preacher.
               Secondly, there are
6. properties of faith.
               First, it accounts all
things most base, in
Comparison of the
knowledge of Christ,Phil. 3 9
and the loue of God in1. Pet. 2. 6.
                  
him. Christ is more
precious then all the
world besides.
               Secondly, it will receaue
the testimony of
Gods faithfull Ministers
out of the world,2. Thes. 1, 10
against the world.
               Thirdly, it is such a
perswasion as cannot
abide hipocrisy, but
purgeth the heart of it,
as of a most hatefull
sinne,2. Tim. 1. 5. and is therefore
called vnfained.
               Fourthly, it will endure
triall; cast it into
the fire of tribulation,1. P
                        •
                     t. 1. 7
and manifold afflictions
and disgraces,2. Tim. 1, 12. and

temptations, yet it will
not perish, nor be ashamed;
it is a plate for the
breast, and a helmet for
the head. 1. Thess. 5.
8
                     •
                   
                  Eph. 6. Whereas the
best faith that is not
the faith of Gods elect,
will proue but drosse,
if it be cast into the furn
                     •
                  ce
of temptation;
further then it is supported
by carnall ends
and helpes.Luke 8. 13
               
               Fiftly, it will beleeue
all things that it apprehendeth
to be required,
threatned, or promised
in the word;Acts 24. 14. to
belieue some things,

may be in other kindes
of faith; especially such
things as stand with
reason, affecting common
opinion, &c.
               Sixtly, in affliction
it laieth hold on Gods
promise or prouidence,
so as it will rest with
quietness,Esay 25. 16. trust and patience,
and not make
hast to the vse of euill,
and vnwarranted
meanes, he that beleeueth
maketh not hast.
               Thirdly, it may bee
tried by the concomitants
of it. for;
               First, it is 
                     •
                  ealed by
the holy spirit of promise;

for in euery beleeuer
the promised spirit
doth print in his
heart the sauing graces
of Christ,Eph. 1. 13, 14. from the
sight of which, as from
so many markes, compared
with Gods promises
in his word, ariseth
by the effectuall
working of the spirit,
this assurance or perswasion
of faith: for
though grace and
faith bee giuen together,
and grow vp together,
yet the assurance
of faith discouers not
it selfe, till it discerne
those companions of it

with which it is daily
incouraged, and confirmed
and setled, that
faith that can be without
sanctification of
the spirit,2. Thes. 2, 13. is not the
faith of Gods elect.
               Secondly,1. Tim. 1, 19. 5. it is ioyned
with a good and
pure conscience.1. Tim 3. 9 Hee
that is truly perswaded
of Gods loue in Christ,He. 10. 22.
maketh conscience of
all his wayes, to seeke
or doe thee good God
requires, and auoyde
the euils God forbids.
               Thirdly,2. Tim 3. 15. it is ioyned
with a spirit of discerning,
or wisdome in

matters of saluation,
the minde being enlightened,
to obserue
in some comfortable
measure, the meaning
of the holy ghost, in
all things needefull to
saluation, in vse of the
word,Psa. 119. 130. through the
power of Gods ordinances,
so as the verie
simple may and doe attaine
to a holy kinde
of insight,Pro. 1. 4, 8, & 5, 9. and sharpenesse
of iudgement.
               Fourthly,1, Ioh, 5: 10 The true
beleeuer hath a witnesse
in himselfe, euen
the witnesse of the spirit
of adoption,Rom, 8, 15 16. infallible

certifying himselfe
of Gods loue and his
adoption.
               Fifthly, faith may be
discerned by certaine
effects of it; for,
               1. It breedeth ioy
vnspeakeable and glorious,1. Pet. 1, 8
and that either
through the sence of
Gods sauour and your
presence,Rom. 5. 2 or in the hope
of glorie to come.
               2. It puts on and
applies a righteousnesse,
that is not by the
worke of the same,Rom. 10. but
in Christ onely.
               3. It will make a
man speake in the confession,

profession and
defence of the truth of
God, I haue beleeued,2. Cor. 4 13. 14.
therefore I spake.
               4. It workes the
longing desires of2. Cor. 5. 7.
Gods presence of glorie.Gal. 5. 5.
               
               5. It workes an effectuall
loue of God
and Gods children,Gel. 5. 6. &
sheweth it selfe by the
fruites of loue.
               6. It will maintaine
a Christian in
some measure of sufficiencie
and contentment
in all estates;Heb, 2. 5. the
iust liues by faith,Rom. 1. 17 not
by friends,Gal. 2
                        •
                     0. mony, earthly

hopes, or helpes &c.
for it will make a man
to lay houlde vpon
Gods promise, and
workes an inward trust
in Gods neuer failing
prouidence, so as hee
will leaue the successe
of all his labours, or
meanes to God.
               7. It excludes, boasting
of our owne labours,
praises, gifts, or
workes,Rom, 3. 17 and in the same
measure workes humilitie,Gal. 3 22.
that it maketh any
other grace.
               8. It ouercommeth
the world,1. 1o. 5. 4. 5 so as
profits, credit, pleasures

carnal friends or hopes
doe not sway and rule
the beleeuer, but hee
willinglie and patientlie
rests in the treasures
and pleasures of a better
world, yeelding
himselfe ouer to bee
guided by Christ and
his truth to the death.Psa. 48. 14
               
               9. It purifieth the
heart from ignorance,
wicked imaginations,
carnall desires,Acts 15. 9 sinfull
perturbations, and all
sorts of secret and inward
sinnes. And this
it doth by causing a
man, dailie to seeke
pardon for them in

Christ, and by casting
them out by confession
and sorrow, in the
same measure, desiring
inward puritie, that it
reioyeeth in Gods
loue.
               10. There is a spring
of grace in the heart of
euery beleeuer,Ioh. 7 38. whence
followes daily the exercise
of sundrie sauing
graces, which can neuer
bee vtterly dried
vp in the heart of a
Christian; and that
is it, our sauiour
Christ meaneth when
hee saith; out of
his bellie shall flow

riuers, of liuing water.
            
            
               6. The spirit of
Adoption.
               THe spirit of adoption
in the
hearts of Gods
Children, may bee discerned.
               First, by the fire of
zeale and holie affections,
with which it fils
the harts of Gods children;Mat, 3. 11,
especially in the
vse of Gods ordinances,Eph, 5, 19
to the information
& reformation of their
liues.
               
                  
Secondly,1. The 1. 5 by the
much assurance, which
especially at som
                     •
                  times
worketh in the heart.
               Thirdly, by a daily
holy strife, to preserue
grace giuen vs,2. Tim. 1. 14 and to
preuent falling away.
               Fourthly, by secret
suggestion or direction,
by which Gods seruants
are reclaimed
when they goe out of
the way,Esa 30. 
                        •
                     1 either on the
right hand, or on the
left.
               Fifthly, by the assise
it keepes in the heart
of a christian,Esay. 4. as a spirit
of iudgement by which

he is made, to watch,
arrest, accuse, condemn
and restraine himselfe,
from euerie euill way,
according to the rules
of the word, & before
Gods holy presence.
               Sixthly, by libertie
from the power of
raigning and presumptuous
sinnes;2. Cor, 3, 17. where
the spirit of God is,Rom. 8. 10
there is libertie.
               Seuenthly, by the
groath and florishing
of true grace.Esay 44, 3 4.
               
               Eighthly, by vnspeakable
ioies, felt in
the presence of God, in
the due vse of his ordinance,

by which a christian
is enflamed to the
loue of God,Rom. 14, 17. and all
holy duties,Ezec. 39 vl
                        •
                     
                   and abased
to the dust in the sence
of his owne vilenesse,
called therefore the
ioies of the holy ghost:
For, as for carnall ioyes
or illusions, either they
are not felt in the vse of
Gods ordinances, or els
they breede pride, and
conceited security.
               Ninthly, by requests
and supplications,Rom, 8. 13 affectionable
and withZac. 12, 10
confidence powered
out vnto God as a father.Eph. 3, 12
               
            
            
               
               7. Vprightnesse of
heart.
               IF thou wouldest
make triall of the
truth and vprighnesse
of thy heart, thou
must seriously examine
thy selfe:
               First,Psa. 32. 2, whether thy
spirit be without guile,Ioh. 1. 4.
more desirous to be
good,Prou▪ 20, 6, 7. then to bee
thought to be so, and
seeking more the power
of godlinesse, then
the shew of it.
               Secondly, whether
thou loue all good

things aswell as one,
and hate all things as
well as one.
               Thirdly, whether
that thou canst loue
and forgiue thy enemies,
that hate, and disgrace,
and wrong thee
aswell as thy friends,
that either wrong thee
not, or but by infirmity.
               Fourthly, whether
thou canst bee content
to receiue euil at Gods
hands, as well as good,
without murmuring
or letting goe thy integrity,Ioh 1, 1, & 2, 3. 10
being carefull to
approue thy selfe to

God without respect
of reward, yea though
trouble did befall thee.
               Fiftly, whether thou
dislike sinne in all,1. Kin. 15 12, 13, 14 euen
in those that are most
neere and deere vnto
thee?
               Sixtly, whether thou
finde in thy heart a resolution
to turne from
nothing that God commaundeth
thee all the
daies of thy life.1. Kin. 15 5, 9, 4.
               
               Seauenthly, whether
thou be innocent from
the great transgression.Psa. 1
                        •
                     , 13
               
               Eightly, whether
thou finde an inward
combate and striffe against

secret sinnes, aswell
as open sinnes, bewailing
the transgressions
against the inward
worship of God,
aswell as against the
ontward.
               Ninthly, whether
thy heart bee humble,Heb. 2, 4
patient,Pro, 21, 29 teachable, and
tractable in some holy
measure,1, Chr, 28. 9. increasing
herein by the vse of
Gods ord
                     •
                  niance? an
vpright heart, is a willing
heart.
               10 Whether thy desire
bee to walke as in
Gods presence.Gen, 17, 1
               
               11 Whether thou

finde a desire to be rid
of sinne, and to humble
thy selfe for it, in prosperitie
aswell as aduersitie,Iob 8, 5, 6
and in the beginning
of afflictions, aswell
as in the extremities
of them.
               12 Whether in
wrongs and disgraces,Psal 7, 10 11, 7.
when thou art innocent,
thou canst (in the
sence of thine owne
vnworthinesse of Gods
loue) make God thy
defence, resting in his
fauour and acceptance.
               13 Whether thou
dost endeauour to glorifie
God,Psal. 33, 1 119, 7. 140, 13. aswell by giuing

thankes for blessings
and graces, as for
praying for supplie of
wants, or pardon of

                     •
                  innes.
               14 Whether thy
heart be stedfast, and
setled, without lying,
flattering, or dissembling;
so seeking and
praying for pardon,
and deliuerance in aduersit
                     •
                  e,
that thou
wouldest practise it after
release, this was a
signe the Israelites
were not vpright,Psa. 78, 36 37. in
that they would crie to
God in their distresse,
but care not for their

vowes and promises,
so soone as they were
deliuered.
               15 Whether the
word of God doe thee
good aboue all things?Mich. 2▪ 7
               
               16 Whether thy
praise be of God,Rom. 2, 29 and
not of men?
               17 Whether thou
dost serue God with
thy whole heart: not
hauing a heart and a
heart,2. Chro. 6. 14. psa. 119▪ 34 either waiuering
or deuided? for vnlesse
the whole resolution
of thy soule, with the
vtmost of thy desires,
bee to walke in Gods
waies, thy heart is

not vpright.
               18 Whether there
be in thee a faithfull
heart,2. Chr. 19. 8 9. to deale faithfullie
in the charge and
calling in which thou
art, and to discharge it
in the conscionable
feare of God?
               19 Whether there
be any sinne thou couldest
not willinglie iudg
thy selfe for it, without
hiding it, so soone as
thou knowest it to be a
sinne: This is the ioy of
a Christian,Psa. 32. 11 & 5. in the sense
of his owne wants and
weakenesses, that
though he haue manie

sinnes, yet there is no
sinne but hee willing lie
acknowledgeth it vnto
God.
               20 Whether thou
be good at home,Psal. 101, 2. as
well as abroade.
               21 Whether thou
canst be contented to
make the Law of God,Psa 119, 1
thy onelie direction in
all things?Deut 18 12. 13
               
               22 Whether thou
canst bee as carefull to
preseuere in grace, as
once to be good?
               23 Whether thou
keepe thy selfe from
thine owne iniquitie.Pro. 13
1. Whether thou dost

conscionablie endeuor
to forsake thy particular,2. Sam. 22 24.
formerly beloued
and speciall sinnes?
               24 Whether thou
be free from the raigne
of frowardnesse in thy
way,Pro. 11, 20▪ & 19, 1. or peruersenesse
of thy lips.
            
            
               8. Holie desires.
               OVr desires may
bee tried fiue
waies. First by
obiects of them. Secondly,
by the quallities
of them. Thirdlie,

by the concomitants
or companions of
them. Fourthly, by effects
or consequents of
them. Fifthly, by the
causes or accidents of
them.
               For the first, those desires
are meant in the
promises,Psa, 73. 25 that are carried
after things aboue
nature, as the fauour of
God, the pardon of
sinnes,Mat. 5. the righteousnesse
of Christ,Heb. 11. 10 16. the presence
of God, and the
saints in the new Ierusalem,
the comming of
Christ to iudgement,Reuel. 22 17. 20.
victorie ouer the deerest

sinnes,Rom, 7 the remouing
of spirituall iudgements,Esa 63, 17
the damnation
of their owne soules,Rom, 9. 3
that Israel might be saued,
and such like.
               There are three principall
quallities in the
holie desires of Gods
elect;Lu. 12. 49. for
               First, they are fierie
                     •
                  
that is, such as cause
the heart of man, to
burnewithn him, with
some measure of zeale
for Gods glorie, indignation
at sinne, and feruent
affection in Gods
seruice, whereas the
desires of the wicked,

at least are either dull
and cold, or transported
by the wrongs, ends
to the fauouring of
sinne.
               Secondlie, they are
constant: both because
they are renued dailie,
as the metaphors of
hunger and thirst doe
import; as also because
they are alike carried
to the eternall fruition
of the things desired, as
to the present enioying
of them, Gods seruants
desire the fauour of
God, the abolishing
of sinne, the possession
of grace, not to serue a

turne for the present,
but to be enioyed as
their portion for euer;
for looke how the man
vnregenerate desires to
commit sinne, so doth
the regenerate desire
to forsake: but the former
in some sins doth
commit them, with a
desire euer to sinne and
a secret discontentmēt
to thinke that at anie
time, he should not be
able to sinne. Euen
such a contrarie desire
is there in Gods elect
truely called, they so
desire not to sinne, as it
is their griefe to thinke

that at any time they
should againe sinne, yea
affliction, doth not
quench them but manie
times inflame
them.Esa. 26, 9▪
                  
               
               Thirdlie, they are
not idle, which may
appeare three waies.
First, because they are
carried after themeanes
of good aswell as good
things themselues:Psa. 27. 4 1, and
that in a great measure
too.Pet, 2, 2 Secondly,Psa. 1, 63 1 
                        •
                     . because
they are attended with
a resolution to doe any
thing that their desires
may bee accomplished:Acts 2, 37▪
                  
they aske what should

they doe to be saued?
as taking it for graunted,
that they must bee
industrious in Gods
worke. There is no labour,
but they would
endeuour to doe it, so
the Lord would bee
mercifull vnto them to
graunt them their desire,
yea when they
haue done all, they still
are humbled because
they can doe no more,
nor no better. Thirdlie,
they cannot rest till
in some happie measure
they ouercome,Reue. 21, 6
the most maisterly corruption
either of nature

or life.
               Thirdlie, holy desires
are accompanied:
               First, with a supernaturall
valuation of
the worth of spirituall
things accoūting them
pearle of the best price
not to deere bought if
they buie them with
the sale of al they haue;Mat. 13. 45. 46.
and contrariwise accounting
themselues
exceeding poore and
distressed,Psa. 42. if they want
them or the meanes of
them,Psa. 63. 1. 3 esteeming Gods
louing kindnoss
                     •
                   better
then life.
               Secondly, with avoluntary

forsaking of
the vnnecessarie pleasures
and profit of the
world,Heb 11. 13 thankfully receiuing
the promises of
a better life, and easily
confessing that they
are strangers and pilgrimes
on the earth.
               Thirdly, with a constant
and secret meditation
of heauenly things
desired,Isay 26. 9 what one desires
feruently,Psa, 63, 1, 6. hee
thinkes on almost continuallie.
               Fourthly, Holy desires
shewe themselues
by diuers effects or
consequents of them,

especially if they be satisfied.
               First,Pro. 11, 23 they chase out
euill desires and raise
vp a dailie combat against
the most secret
corruptions of nature.Roae, 7. 25
               
               Secondlie,Lam, 2, 19 the excite
a frequencie and feruencie
in praier to God
in secret.
               Thirdlie they worke
a resolution to walke
in the way,Es. 35. 7. 8 that is called
holie, yea so gracious
is the Lord, that
the most simple, if their
desires bee most true,
attaine to some happie

measure of reformation.
               Fourthlie, if the Lord
graunt their desires,
there followes:
               First heauenlie kindePs 63, 5
of satisfaction and contentation
with singular
delight in the soule.Ier. 31, 25, 26.
               
               Secondlie the vowes
and wishes of infinite
and eternall thankfulnesse.Psa, 63. 4.
               
               Thirdlie a groweth
and springing vp as among
the grasse,Esa. 44, 3 or as
willowes by the water
courses.1. Pet. 2, 2
               
               Lastlie, they arise
from a broken & humbled

spirit, and the
more they are inflamed,Mat. 5. 4. 5 6.
the more humbled
they continue to
be.
            
            
               9. The spirit of
praier.
               HE that calleth
on the name
of the Lord aright,
discouereth the
spirit of grace & praies
in his heart, by these
things.
               1. He askes according
to Gods will.1. Ioh. 5. 
                        •
                     
                  
               
               2. Hee praies with
perswasion that GodMar. 11, 14
                  
will heare,Iam. 1. 6. 7▪
                   he beleeueth
he shal haue it,Psa. 6. 9. he praies
in faith and assurance
of heart before God.1, Ioh. 3, 19 22.
               
               3.Iob. 14, 13 He praies in the
name of Christ in the
sence of his owne vilenesse

of Christ.
               OVr obedience
wil be approued

in Christ, if it be an
obedience that will

lo
                     •
                  e to God and goodnesse.
The obedience

of Gods elect is from
the heart,Deut. 30. 20 not constrained
but volūtary,Iosh. 22. 5▪
                   their
hearts being inflamed
with the sence of Gods
goodnesse, and humbled
when they haue
done their best,Mat. 4. 19 that
they cannot bring
more glory to God; it
is a ready obedience
without repining,Rom. 6, 17 excuse
or delay.

things,Ex.

yea life it selfe.Mat 16. 25
               
               4 If it follow the
conscionable practice
of the duties of mortification,
of sinnes past
or present,1. Pet. 1. 22. the reformation
and profession of
such people as did neuer
in secret humble
their soules for sinne,

may bee much suspected,
for our hearts
must be purified to obey
the truth.
               5 If it bee in absence
as vvell as presence,
in all companies
as vvell as anie, before
meane Christians,
as before the
best,Phil. 2. 12 at home as well
as abroad.Gal. 5. 7
               
               6 If it be alwaies,2. King 18 6. as
well as for a fit.Psa. 106. 3
               
               7 If we belieue and
obey Gods Ministers,
as the ouerseers of our
soules and liues,Heb. 13 directing
vs out of the
Word,2, Thes. 3 as vvell as if

vvee were commaunded
immediatly from
God.
               8 If wee obey in
the Cōmaundements
of faith, as well as life,
submitting our selues
to God,Rō. 10 16 as well by beleeuing
as by dooing,Rō. 16. 26
yeelding our seruice as
well to the Gospell as
to the Lawe.2. The. 1. 8
               
               9 If wee obey in
the least commaundement,
as well as in the
greatest, making conscience
of the smallest
things required,Mat. 5. 19
or forbidden in the
Word.Gat. 5 7.
               
               
                  
10 It is an obedience
that followes the
sanctification of the
spirit. Holy dutyes
without they flowe
from holy graces within;1. Pet, 1. 2
neither can the life
bee holy before God,
if the heart bee not
made holy, by the
grace of Iesus Christ.
               11 It is ioyned with
the raigne of no sinne;
a Christian that truly
obeyes God may haue
many sinnes, but there
is no sinne to which he
yeelds himselfe wholly
ouer,Rom. 6 by secret vows
and resolution as a seruant

to obey it: hee
may faile in his obedience,
so as hee cannot
do what God requires
as he requires; but yet
hee consents to obey,Esa. 
                        •
                     . 19
and his will is to hire
himselfe to doe Gods
worke aswell as he can.
And to this end hee
hearkneth to his voice,
& seekes God with his
whole heart, that hee
may keepe his testimonies,Psa: 119. 2
he consenteth to
obey,Deut. 6. 2
                        •
                     . and obserues to
doe: he comes to the
light that his deedes
may bee made manifest.Ioh. 3. 
                        •
                     
                  
               
               
                  
Lastly, our obedience
is right & acceptable,
if GOD heare
our prayers, for God
heareth not sinners:Ioh. 9. 31
and Dauid sayth,Psa. 66: 18 if
there were wickednes
in his heart, GOD
would not heare his
prayers.
            
            
               11 Sauing knowledge.
               SAuing knowledge
may be tried:

                     1. By the obiects.
                     2. By the causes.
                     3. By the cōcomitants.
                     
                        
4. By the properties.
                     5. By the effects.
                  
               
               For the first, by this
knowledge the elect
are inlightned by the
spirit of reuelation.
               1. To conceiue aright
of the nature of
God, in some measure
propounding before
the eye of their minds

in the word,Ier 9. 24 at

               7 To knowe the
voice of Christ, discerning
it in some measure
from the voice of
a stranger.Ioh. 1

                     . 4.
               
               8 To knowe their
owne conuersion,1. 10. 3. 14 and
al needful holy things.Pro. 9. 10.

owne saluation.Luke 1. 77
               
               Secōdly, this knowledge
may bee discerned
from other knowledge,
by the causes:
for,
               1 Flesh and blood
hath not reuealed it,Mat. 16. 17
it is a wisdom in a mystery,
it is giuen of God
in Christ by the anointing

and experience of it in
many, who neuer came
to sound knowledge,
till they haue beene
wounded by the feeling
of Gods wrath,Ho. 6. 1. 2. 3. or
their owne sinnes, or
the venomed temptations
of Sathan.
               3. It is quickned and
nursed by the sweete
refreshings and contentments
felt in Gods
house.Ps 36. 8. 9. 10.
               
               4 It is founded

of GOD;Iob. 18. 28. the very

and good works grow
in vs.2. Pe. 3. 18
               
               Thirdly, it hath
sixe companions of it
among the rest, that in
speciall attend it.
               1 The loue of the
Law.Psal. 119. 97. 98
               
               2 A holy estimation
of it aboue all
possessions,Phil. 3. 8 shewed,Pro. 3. 3. 4. 7. & 7. 4. & 8. 9. 10

all, getting labors
to get this vnderstanding,
and reioyceth

ornament.

               5. Sence, that is,Phil. 1. 9. inward
feelings of the
power of the word &
ordinances of God.
               6 The loue of Gods
childrē which aboundeth
as this knovvledge
growes.Phi 1. 9. 10
               
               Fourthly it hath six
properties.
               1 It is affectionate,
it is not written in the
head,Ier. 31. 34 but in the heart
and bowels.Deu. 46
               
               2 It tends to actionPs 111. 10
and practice.Isa, 33, 6
                  Ioh, 8, 55
               
               3 It is constant and1. Ioh, 2, 3 & 3, 24
indelible, it hath deepePhil. 1. 9 10
                  
impressions and much
assurance,Ier 31. 34 so as it is not
easily vnsetled vvith
the puffes of contrary
doctrine,Pro. 4. 5, 16 nor can it be
extinguished by trials
or afflictions;Eph. 4. 13 therfore
it is sayde to be written
vpon their hearts.
               4 It is sincere, for
first it inclineth to receiue
all truth,Ioh. 16. 13 as well
as any truth:1, Cor▪ 3, 1
                        •
                     
                   secondly,
it will receiue the
truth, though it be against
reason,1. Cor, 2 7 common
opinion, profit, or the
like.
               Fifthlie, It brookes
not the impotent rudiments

and beggerlie
inuentions of men, in
the things of the kingdome
of Iesus Christ.
               Sixthlie, it leades a
man principally to vnderstand
his own way;Pro. 14, 8
and by it a man teacheth
and admonisheth
himselfe.Col. 3, 16
               
               Lastly, it beareth
fruite better then gold

                     
                        •
                     ro. 8. 19. and by the
fruites or effects it may
be knowne.
               1. It lasteth out conc
                     •
                  itednesse,
diffidence,
insensiblenesse of Gods
mercies and iudgements,
and vnthankfulnesse:

he that hath true
knowledge,Pro. 3, 5, 6 will not
leane to his owne naturall
wisedome, hee
will trust in the Lord,
and acknowledge him
in all his waies.
               2. It makes a man
humble and lowlie, in
the same measure that
one abounds in true
knowledge, in the same
measure hee is made
more lowlie and
meeke, and carefull in
all his waies;Pro. 8, 13 14▪
                   no scorner
can finde this wisedome.
               3. It mortifieth boisterous
& vnrulie, hatefull

& hurtfull affections,
it will make a lion
become a lambe, and a
beare,Isa. 11, 9 or a wolfe, or a
cockatrice, to be willingly
guided, euen by
a little childe, &c.
               4. It extinguisheth
or greatly dulleth the
sauor of earthly things
and makes a man heauenly
minded.Rom. 8, 6
               
               5. This and such
like other affects are altogether
set downe by
the Apostle Iames in
his third Chapter,Iam, 3▪ 17 18. and
the seuenteene and
eighteene verses.
            
            
               
               12. Loue of God.
               OVR loue to
God, may bee
knowen.
               First,Eph, 6, 
                        •
                      
                     
                        •
                     4 by the sincere and
incorrupt loue of the
Lord Iesus, the sonne
of his loue.
               Secondlie, by the
loue of his image in al
the saints of God,1, Ioh. 5, 1 that
are begotten by him.
               Thirdly, by the base
estimatiō of the world
and the lusts thereof,
for if anie man,1, Ioh, 2, 15 loue
the world, the loue of

the father is not in
him.
               Fourthly, by a deliberate
inward inflamed
estimation of
God aboue all things,Psa. 63. 2 1, 11.
accounting his louing
kindenesse better then
life, and the signes of
his fauour our greatest
ioy.
               Fifthly, by our delight
in his presence
which is then approued.
               1. If wee loue to
speake often to God by
praier,Ps
                        •
                     . 34. 5 37, 4. 
                        •
                     
                   and heare him
speake often to vs, in
his other ordinances.
               
                  
2. If we loue,2 Tim. 4, 8 and
long for his appearing.

to keepe his commandements,Ioh. 14, 21
and to be as
he is in holinesse,1. Ioh 4. 17 which
may be further tried.
               1. If we willinglie receiue
his commaundements,
for this is the
loue of God, that wee
keepe his commandements,1. Ioh. 5 3

are not grieuous.

               Seuenthly, by our
sensiblenesse of his dishonor

Ninthlie,Exod. 15 2. by our care
not onely to do his wil
but to please him,1. Ch 28. 9 being
more incouraged

praise of al men.Heb. 1

to suffer anie thing for
his sake.Ioh 22, 15 to 19.
               
               11. By a detestation
as of sinne,Psa. 97, 10 because
God hates it,Psa. 139 21, 22. so of sinners,
because they hate
God.
               12. By our desire to
stirre vp our affections
after God, auoiding
what might steale away
our hearts from him,

and delighting in al the
waies,Iosh. 23. 11 by which our
hearts might be inflamed
towards him, and
to this end taking
heede to our selues.
               13. By our running
to him in all aduersitie,
making him
our defence, our
rocke, our refuge in
all trouble, to them
we first runne to make
our mone,Psa 1
                        •
                     . 1. 2 whom we
most loue.
               14. By our willingnesse,
affectionatelie to
doe the meanest office
vnto God, or Christ, or
for his sake this was a

signe that Marie loued
much,Luk. 7. 44 4 5. 46, 47 because she
was content to wash
with her teares, and wiped
with her haire the
very feete of Christ.
               15 By our humility
in the sence of Gods
loue to vs, for ere the
more a Christian discouers
Gods loue to
him, the more his affection
to God, makes
him seeme base &1. Cor. 8, 3 vile
in his owne eies.
               16 By our sorrow
for our sinnes and
willingnesse to forsake
and cut off from vs,
the most gainefull

gainefull and pleasing
corruptions,Deu. 30, 6 this is
ment by the circumcising
of the heart, that
we might loue God.
            
            
               13. The sacraments.
               THe sacraments
are sure seales
and infallible
pledges of Gods, loue
and our saluation, to
the worthie receiuer:
and he receiues worthelie.
               First, that desires to
search his heart and examine
his life,1. Cor. 11. before
he receiue.
               
                  
Secondly, that discernes
the Lords body
that meditates oft, and
is in knowledge infallibly
perswaded of the
inward & effectual presence
of the Lord to he
worthie receiuer.
               Thirdlie, that eates
with sorore herbs,Exod. 12 that
is, that comes with
some measure of sence
and feeling with th
                     •
                  
burthen of his sinnes,
& desire to make them
his greatest sorrow.
               Fourthlie, that resolueth
and purposeth
and inwarldlie, couenaunteth
in his soule,

to deuote himselfe to
God,1. Cor, 5, 8 and godlinesse,
and to striue against euerie
sinne that 
                     •
                  hee
knowes may offend
God.
               Fifthlie, that constantlie
desires to beleeue
Gods mercie in
Iesus Christ to his
owne soule in particular;Mat. 16. 16
and comes with a
perswasion,Col. 2, 12 in some
measure of the operation
of God, in the inward
grace of the sacrament.
               Sixthly, that feeles
the ioies of Gods presence,
and the working

of Gods spirit, inwardly
sealing in his
heart the perswasion
of his interest in Gods
promises,Eph. 1, 23 bearing witnesse
to his spirit,1. Cor, 1, 22 that
God is graciously reconciled
in Christ, and
his sinnes are pardoned,
&c.
               Seuenthly, that loues
all the brethren and
desires to bee furthered
in all holie communion
with them,
both in grace and glorie;1▪ Cor. 10
being readie to
witnesse before God
and men his resolution
to honour and

cleaue to them aboue
all other professions &
sorts of mē in the world
               Eightly, that desires
to liue in peace and
godlie vnitie,Ma. 5, 6, 
                        •
                     4 and willinglie
forgiueth al that
haue trespassed against
him.
            
            
               14. The feare of God.
               THe true feare
of God may be
discerned; first,
by effects; secondly, by
the properties of it.
               First, The true feare
God, workes a care &
endeuour to serue God

and keepe his commaundements,Deu, 6. 13 & 8, 6 and by
the feare of God men
depart from euill:Pro. 8, 13 16, 6
For it teacheth men
to hate euill,Reui. 15, 4 as pride,
arrogancie, the euill
way, and a froward
mouth: the wise
man saith; He that walketh
in vprightnesse feareth
the Lord,
                  Pro 14, 2 and by
that signe he may bee
knowne euen by aconsionable
care to walke
vprightlie with God
in holie life.
               Secondly, it casts out
carnall feares, he is not
in much feare of men,Ma. 10, 28
                  
that can kill the bodie,
that is truely touched
with the feare of God,Ma
                        •
                     . 10. 28
that can destroy both
body and soule,Es. 8, 12, 13 hee
feares not their feare,
nor the feares of the
wicked men, but in
some measure sanctifies
God in his heart.
               Thirdlie, It makes a
man desirous and capable
of sauing knowledge:
for this feare of
God,Pro. 1, 7 is the beginning
of wisedome.
               Secondlie, there
bee fiue properties
of the true feare of
God.
               
                  
First, it is sincere, for
he that truelie feares
God.
               1. Feares Gods offence
aswell as pnnishment.
               2. Hee will feare
Gods presence being
carefull to a
                     •
                  oide such
sinnes, as no eie sees
but Gods.
               3. He will feare God
though he see no reward
in his hand.
               4. He feares Gods
word and is more troubled
and humbled by
the threatning of it,Psa. 119
then by the threatning
of anie mortall man,

and will obey the voice
of Gods seruants,
whatsoeuer comes of
it.
               5. He will obey against
reason, affection
profit, or pleasure, for
so saith the Lord to
Abraham;
                  Gē, 22, 12 now I know
thou fearest God seeing
thou hast not withheld
thy sonne, thy only
sonne.
               Secondly, it is filiall,
not seruile, which may
appeare in fiue things,
for first it is ioined with
the loue of God,Deu. 10. 12. 20 and
so is not the feare of
reprobates; secondly

it is not compelled
by feare or sence of
iudgements, but excited
by the sence of
Gods goodnesse and
mercie. For so the conuerts
in Hosea,
                  Isa, 29, 23 are said
to feare God and his
goodnesse.Hos. 3, 5. Thirdly, it
guides the heart of
man to runne to God,
and not from God) to
bee healed of the
wounds made by si
                     •
                  ne
and to bee protected,Ma, 4, 2
striuing euen before
God, to discouer
and get strength against
the sinnes that
trouble them; fourthly

It makes a man trust
in God, and ere the
more it increaseth, the
more it worketh affiance
and confidence
in Gods mecry. 5.Psa. 31. 19 & 115. 11 & 147. 11 It
causeth a man to loue
and cleaue to such as
are Gods Children,
though they be in disgrace
with the world.Psa. 11 9, 79
               
               Thirdly, it is a speaking
feare, it will speak
to God by prayer, and
to men by conference,
it cannot be silent; but
will speake in defence
of Gods glory &Mal. 3, 16 truth
and seekes to draw others
from sinne.
               
                  
4 It is a contenting
feare, it finds treasures
in godlinesse, and is satisfied
with his portiō,Esa. 33. 6
and will abide satisfied
whereas the feares of reprobates
are either full
of inwarde horror of
conscience,Pro. 19. 23 or perturbation
in the heart.
               5 It is constant, it is
not for a fit, but alwaies,
not in sicknesse
or misery,Ecc. 8. 11 but in prosperity,
or all aboundance,Deut. 6. 24
& contrariwise
not in prosperity only,
when men may feare
God without daūger
but in trouble also.
            
            
               
               15. Loue of enemies.
               OVr loue to our
enemies is sincere.Mat. 5. 44
               
               1 If we can pray for
them.
               2 If we can voluntarily
mourne &Psa. 35, 13 14. humble
our soules for them
in their distresses.
               3 If we truly desire
their conuersion, and
find that we could loue
thē vnfainedly if they
had repented.
               4 If we can forgiue
them their trespasses against
vs.Mat, 6. 14 15
               
               
                  
5 If wee bee more
grieued for their sinnes
against God, then for
their wrongs to vs.
               6. If we can acknowledge
freely their iust
praises.
               7 If we can patiently
and meekely endure
their reuilings,1, Pe, 3, 10 being
willing to bee at peace
without reuenge.Rō. 12. 14
               
               8 If wee can forbeare
when wee could
bring shame or misery
on them.1. Sam. 24 18. 19.
               
               9 If we can endeauor
to ouercome their
euill with goodnesse,
and to relieue them in

misery,Rom. 12 or to doe any
other good,Pro. 25. 21▪ 22 either for
body or soule.
            
            
               16. Desire of death.
               THE desire of
death will bee
our Testimonie.
               1. If it arise out of
the sence of Gods loue.Luk. 2. 2
                        •
                     , 30
               
               2. If it bee conceiued
in time of prosperity.
               3. Especially,Ps. 39. 1, 4 if it
arise out of a weariness
of our owne sins,Ioh. 6. 9. 10▪
                   andRom. 7, 24
