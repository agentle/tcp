               De Oeconomia Chriſtiana, A matter cōtaining a Chriſtianlike ordering & gouerning

of an houſhoulde and familie: collected, framed and compoſed in the Latine tongue (after the order of a Dialogue) by the firſt Author Bartholomew Batty of Aloſtenſis for the vtilitie and profite of his brethren, children, and countrie men, whereof. I taking ſome good liking at the firſt viewe, ſetled my ſelfe therein, and would not giue it ouer, vntill ſuche time as I had throughly peruſed and diligently read ouer the ſame. And the matter being pitthy, pleaſaunt and profitable, bewrapt me in ſuch delight, that I could not chooſe, but beſtow the ſecond reading therof, & ſo waded through againe with a more deep conſideration, care and diligence then before. Thus paſſing through the ſecond time I gleyned and gathered together certaine ſpeciall notes for mine owne better inſtruction and reformation of mine owne family. Of the whiche when ſome of my deare friendes had taken the viewe, together with the Booke, and alſo hauing good liking thereof, they beganne to perſwade me earneſtly, and that with many and great reaſons, that it would be very profitable not only vnto my ſelfe, for mine owne priuate exerciſe and increaſe of knowledge (but alſo vnto all Parents & childrē, Maiſters and ſeruants old and young, of what eſtate, degree & condition ſoeuer, being ignorant of the Latine tongue) if I would beſtow, not only the tranſlating therof. But alſo afterwards commit the ſame to the printing, that therby our countrie and countriemen (which are right deare vnto vs) might alſo reape ſome profite and commodity. And albeit I thought my ſelfe farre vnfit for that purpoſe and not ſufficiētly able to performe their honeſt & earneſt requeſts nor to manifeſt the Authours iuſt deſerued praiſe, in framing ſo fit a paterne for this our age & time. Yet at the laſt aſwel for their importunacy, as alſo chiefly for the increaſe of mine owne knowledge, and to doe my countriemen

ſome pleaſure (after the example of others.) I haue preſumed very boldly to attēpt this matter. And as time would permit me frōmine other daily exerciſes, haue brought the ſame to ſuch effect as may now appeare, without any iniury vnto the firſt Authour. I haue now diſfurniſhed & changed him out of his owne rich robes and gallant garments, and haue apparelled him after the Engliſh faſhion, which though perhaps to ſome may ſeeme euill ſhapen, at the firſt ſight, and will alſo deeme, that the ſtuffe is not ſo fine, excellent and coſtly, nor ſet out with ſuch delicate deuiſes, picked points, and curious colours, as the worthineſſe of the thing doth deſerue, nor that I haue ſhewed my ſelfe ther in a cunning and skilful Artificer: yet is it good, wholſome and durable, and not of the courſeſt nor vileſt kind of ſtuffe, neyther of the baſeſt and ſimpleſt faſhion. So that ſuch as ſhall behold the ſound body and inward ſubſtance, rather thē the outward ſhew, and ſhall endure the ſame vnto the end: ſhal find (no doubt) ſufficient matter miniſtred vnto them: to garde and defend them at all aſſayes from many miſhaps, ſharpe ſhowers, terrible tempeſts, iniuries and inconueniences, which otherwiſe for want therof, might more ſodainly annoy them. And for that your worſhips are Fathers of many children (which I am perſwaded are dearly beloued vnto you) and maiſters of great families, wherof I knowe you haue care to be vertuouſly inſtructed, guided, gouerned and trayned vp in the feare of God. And becauſe this whole diſcourſe tendeth to the ſame purpoſe and effect, I haue thought it good to offer theſe my ſimple paynes and trauels vnto your woorſhips, as the preſent of a true and faithfull friend, which faine would haue offered you a better gift, if his power would haue extended thereunto. But herein following the examples of poore men in the auncient hyſtories, I am ſo much the bolder, euen for the very goodwill

I beare to you and yours. Humbly beſeeching your woorſhips to ſhrowd the ſame vnder the ſhadow of your wings. So ſhall I thinke my ſelfe ſafe, let the bawling Barkers, curious Cauillors, ſawſie Sycophants and Momus his mates, with all the rable of Ruffians in their fretting fumes ſay what they can. Which if you wil vouchſafe to doe, I haue my whole deſire, and will continually pray vnto Almightie God, to ſend you in this earthly habitatiō happie health, ioyfull proſperitie, with the increaſe of much woorſhippe. And after this life euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe in the heauenly Hieruſalem.

            To the Reader.
            
               AFter that I had finiſhed this ſmall treatiſe (gentle and louing Reader) being mooued thereunto partely for mine owne pleaſure and increaſe of knowledge, and then againe vrged by the earneſt inſtigation of ſome friendes, for our countries cauſe (which ſtādeth in great need of the godly and wholeſome documents, with the graue counſels & pithie preceptes in this litle volume contayned.) And herewithal calling to mind that worthy & notable ſaying of the Diuine Philoſopher Plato, cyted by Cicero in his firſt booke of Offices. Non nobis ſolum nati ſumus: ortus enim noſtri, partem patria vendicat, partem parentes, partem amici. I was heereby incited, ſtirred, and procured, to make this more familiar and openly knowne vnto thee, beeyng a matter ſo profitable and neceſſary for all parents, maiſters, children, and ſeruants, Wherein as in a moſt cleere glaſſe they may plainly ſee, what doth appertayne to their ſeuerall dueties.
            And albeit I haue vſed a playne and ſimple ſtile in this my trāslation: yet well beſeeming the matter (I truſt) though perhaps not to eche mans lyking. For it is truely ſaide of Terence, Quot homines tot ſententiae. Or: Quot capita, tot ſenſus. So many men, ſo many mindes. Or: So many heades, ſo many wittes. So that I thinke it an imposſible thing to pleaſe euery mans iudgement, neither is it my purpoſe and meaning. But I haue offered this vnto thy viewe, aſwell for the diſcharge of my conſcience, as alſo for the entire loue I beare vnto my natiue countriemen, let the curious cauiller ſay what hee will.

Praying the (gentle Reader) to take in good parte the ſimpleneſſe of my gift, and let it not greeue thee to beſtowe thy paines and diligence in the reading ouer this fruitfull Dialogue, for thine own profite and commoditie. Haue not ſo great regard vnto the authoritie of the writer: as to note diligently what it is, that is written. I dare warrant thee, that the oftener thou readeſt it with due conſideration and aduiſement, the greater ſhalbee thy profite, and as for my paynes and trauaile taken herein, if I may reape thy good will, I aske no more.

               My wife, with my whole familie are in very good health (thankes bee vnto God) if you weigh and conſider only their bodies. But if you inwardly beholde their ſoules (which is the moſt excellent part of man) then ſhall you finde nothing to bee more lamented, nothing more miſerable, nothing (to bee ſhort) more out of order, the Lorde God amend it when his will is.

                     leth the ſtate of diſordered families. euery where, I am exceedingly mooued with ſorrowe: for I ſee the youth growe vp in euery place without any inſtruction of godlineſſe, vertue or good manners, as if they were the children of the moſt barbarous nations, nay rather of the very Turkes and Infidels, ſo little regarde is there

of true godlineſſe and vertue for the moſt part. And againe when I am cō
                  pelled to come to mine owne familie and to conſider the ſame ſo farre out of order (I had welnigh ſaid vtterly corrupted and paſt al hope) I am altogether wearie of my life: For by the diſpoſition of mine owne children I eaſily gather, that the youth in this our age is not onely void of al good diſcipline, but alſo growne to ſuch libertie and boldneſſe, that almoſt they wil receiue no admonition, be it neuer ſo godlie. This plague when I note in mine owne: I am moued vnto anger, I chide, I threaten, yea and ſometime I ſtrike them, but with al theſe thinges it auaileth little or nothing. Wherfore very earneſtly and not without teares I haue often deſired of Almighty God, that in this my greate heauineſſe and ſorrowe hee woulde vouchſafe to ſend me ſome wholſome and godlie Counſel, ſo that after many praiers, & ſupplicatiōs made, I haue foūd nothing to be more profitable for me, then to cōmit the ſame to ſome godly and learned man, which after I had deepely weighed & conſidered in my mind, you are the firſt with whom I met, therfore al ſhame laide aparte, I come vnto you, as it were mine only aide and ſanctuarie, & this hath bin often in my mind heretofore, but I haue byn afraide to trouble you, yet now at the laſt, neceſſitie that cruel weapon, hath euen compelled mee to ſhake of al ſhame and feare.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               I am angry with this your continual & vnprofitable ſhamefaſtneſſe: haue not I euer borne you goodwill, euen as to my brother? And therefore, why ſhoulde you not bée bolde to come vnto mée after a familier manner? I haue often promiſed vnto you my ſtudie and trauell without any exception, & am ſtill mynded to performe the ſame: what is the cauſe therfore that you haue not come to my houſe? ſo that if you had come, think not that you ſhould haue troubled me, but rather that nothing could haue chaunced more acceptable, and ioyfull vnto me then your preſence.
            
            
               Amuſus.
               Reuerend Sir, I moſt humbly thanke you for this your greate curteſie and goodwil towards me, and I heartily pray you, that according to your accuſtomed wiſedome and godlineſſe you would teach me, and as it were with your finger, point me out the methode & order of godly & vertuous education & inſtructing of children, for albeit I am vnlearned, & a poore houſe keeper, yet (God is my witneſſe) how earneſtly I doe deſire & wiſh with al my heart, to ſee my poore and wretched children godly and vertuouſly

trained vp and inſtructed in the true knowledge, faith, religion, & feare of almighty God. And further, that they might be taught in al ciuilitie and good manners, and ſo learne to walke in the waies of our Lorde God, that at the laſt after this wretched miſerable and ſhort life, they may be made heires of that moſt excellent and euerlaſting ioy with the electe and Saintes of God in heauen: for what other thing is this life, then duſt, a ſhadow, and the very image of death? The prophet Dauid ſaith, thou haſtPſal. 39. made my daies as it were a ſpanne long, and mine age is euen as nothing in reſpect of thee: And verily euery man liuing is altogether vanitie. For man walketh in a vaine ſhadow, and diſquieteh himſelfe in vaine: Hee heapeth vp riches, and cannot tell who ſhall gather them.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Verely, neither by chaunce, nor fortune▪ haue you come hither, but by the determinate wil and appointment of God. Foraſmuch as I haue earneſtly deſired to haue ſome cōference about this matter with a man thus hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſſe, the woorde of God, and chiefly in this kinde of ſtudie, or exerciſe, wherein is handled the dutie of houſholders, Parentes and Children, then the which in this our time I iudge nothing more acceptable to God, nothing more profitable or neceſſarie to mankinde: For as there is nothing more to bée lamented, then that father of houſholde which neglecteth his familie in their good reformation: ſo is there none more honeſt or godly, then hée which beginneth to informe his youth euen from their young and tender yéeres, and doeth prouide to haue them diligently inſtructed in all good & godly literature: And agayn as there is nothing more vnſéemely or to bée lamented in a familie or houſholde, then to ſée the youth ſuffered to growe vp & paſſe foorth their time, without ſhewing vnto their Parentes or Maiſters, any honour, reuerence, or obedience: ſo is there nothing more pleaſing vnto God, & more ioyful to Parents and Maiſters, then diligently to ſée their families exerciſed in the feare and loue of God, and to ſhew due honour vnto their Parents or maiſters, with al obedience and reuerence in the Lord.
            
            
               Amuſus.
               It is God onlie, and that by his prouidence wherwith he gouerneth althinges, that guided and brought me vnto you, to the ende that I of you beeing wel, and Godlie inſtructed might returne vnto my familie,

and that ſo heereafter I may bee able to exhort and inſtruct my children, and ſeruants, that they aſwell by mine examples, as exhortations and counſels, may learne to ſerue God, and walke in his waies all the dayes of their liues.

               When I had diligently read ouer Saint Paule 1. Corin. 12. If one member ſuffer, all ſuffer with him: if one member bee had in honor, al the members bée glad alſo. I doe not iudge my ſelfe bounde to you onely, as one member to another, as the foote to the hand, and eare to the eye, but I acknowledge my ſelfe a ſeruant vnto all men, and that I am borne to the ende I ſhoulde doe good vnto all with counſelling, teaching, and reléeuing their neceſſities to the vttermoſt of my power, chiefly mée to whom hee hath committed his talent. And I being thus admoniſhed with this leſſon of Saint Paule, when I was about xxv. yéeres olde, It chaunced that I tooke in hand this paines, not without great care and diligence to gather together examples out of diuers Authours, wherby I might admoniſhe and inſtruct aſwell fathers and maiſters, as children and ſeruants of their dueties, ſéeing that I iudged this kinde of doctrine very profitable for both: and that the chiefe parte of mans happineſſe in this life floweth out of this fountaine. And to the end that this my paines might bée more profitable vnto all men, I began to collect from all partes of the beſt Authours, diuers Sayings, Examples, Apothegmes, Similitudes, Compariſons, & the moſt apt ſentences, which ſéemed to apperteine or tende any thing at all, to the inſtructing either of parents or children in their ſeuerall dueties. And theſe are gathered chiefly out of the ſacred writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles.
               Moreouer, I haue choſen and ſelected out of the writinges of godly fathers ſuch things as I haue thought méete for this purpoſe whereunto laſtly I haue ioyned alſo very many things out of the Philoſophers, which might▪ ſéeme any thing profitable to godly houſholders, So that I haue indeuoured in this my ſtudie, thatThe workes commended. my collection might increaſe to a reaſonable volume, without doubt very profitable and neceſſary for fathers, mothers, and children, wherein as in a moſt cleare glaſſe, they may plainely ſée what is their ſeuerall dueties.

Wherfore if it pleaſe you, we wil come to you tomorrowe, in the meane time I wil certefie him hereof, whereby he may heare you with better attention, and demaund of you more aptly the thinges that are conuenient, I in the meane while wil giue my ſelfe to ſilence, ſo that with ſome profite I may heare your godly communication, and commit the ſame to memorie with all that I may.

               I can not but greatly commend this your wholſome counſell, vndoubtedly all things ſhall haue good ſucceſſe, if Theophilus will vouchſafe to handle this kinde of argument with mée, for we haue conferred many thinges heretofore, concerning the education of children: therefore you haue done well to put mée in remembrance of him, But for that the night approcheth, let vs prepare our ſelues to reſt, and call vpon God with heartie and feruent prayers, that hée wil graunt tomorrow, that I may ſo ſpeake, and you ſo heare,

as that his glorie may be ſet foorth, and the good ſtate of many families increaſed.

               Syr, according to your appointment yeſterday, I haue not feared to come vnto you with our verie friend Theophilus, and haue alſo brought with mee Martina my welbeloued wife, that ſhee might in like manner heare, and perfectly vnderſtand your godly admonitions, for this is without all controuerſie, ſhee muſt ſhewe her ſelfe aſwell a Mother, as I a Father, vnto our family. And for this cauſe, by the commandement of God, ſhee is no leſſe bounde to doe her duetie, than I mine: and this can ſhee not doe, except ſhee be firſt taught of ſome bodie.

                  Martina) and I can you thanke, that you haue followed the wiſe counſell of your huſband, for it is moſt certain, that your children and family are as well committed vnto your charge, as vnto your huſbande.
            
            
               Martina.
               Reuerend ſir, I beleeue nothing to be truer, than that you haue ſaid, and for that cauſe am I come hither, to heare your godly cōference, wherby I might the rather learne, how to accompliſh and performe my duetie.
            
            
               Amuſus.
               Syr, yeſterſtay I was ſo rauiſhed with your wordes, and had ſuch great ioy & pleaſure in them, that I was once minded to haue brought all my children with mee.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Good neighbour Amuſe, tomorrow ſhal bee more conuenient for that purpoſe, when we ſhal treate of their dueties (that is to ſay) the honour and obedience that children owe vnto their Parents: for then ſhal it be good that you bring them all, becauſe it ſhal bee verie profitable for them.

               But before we procéede any further, I thinke it méete to diuide the argument vnto you that be here preſent, to the ende that an order being obſerued, all thinges may the more eaſily be vnderſtood. Wherfore we wil diuide this argument into ſixe partes: and firſt we will ſpeake of Matrimonie, and the procreation of children. Secondly, of the profite and neceſſitie of inſtruction. Thirdly,

wée ſhewe certaine dueties perteining to the Mothers. Fourthly,The argument diuided into ſi

Fiftly, wee will declare that children are often puniſhed for the offences of Parentes. Sixtly, and laſtly, wée will let you vnderſtande of certaine vices, from the which your children are to be feared. Of theſe points ſeuerally (by the aſſiſtance of almightie God, without whō we can doe nothing) with the greateſt diligence and wiſedome that wée may, wée will ſpeake in order, and thoſe thinges which wée cannot finiſh in one day, wée will end them in two or thrée.

               I would it might pleaſe God, to grant vs many of your mind and towardneſſe: but ah las, I feare me that the moſt men do more eſtéeme millians, nay rather one millian of golde, than the counſell and admonitions of their faithfull friends, though neuer ſo learned and godly. The world is now ſet on ſuch folly, vndoubtedly moſt like vnto the Aſſe, that had rather to féede on the dry Barly ſtraw, then of good wheate, were it neuer ſo ſwéete and pleaſaunt. But I will omit theſe thinges, and returne to my purpoſe: And for becauſe mariage is the original and fountaine of all priuate and publike gouernment, I will touch ſome thinges, of the beginning, excellencie, and end thereof. Mariage is properly a lawfull and godlyThe definition of mariage. ioyning together of one man, and one woman, ordeined to the ſeruice of God, for the procreation and vertuous educatiō of children, to the preſeruation of his Church and common wealth. Or as ſome other ſay, it is the lawfull coupling together of a man & his wife, inſtituted for the cauſe of procreatiō of children, and the auoyding of fornication.
            
            
               
               Theophilus.
               What is more true or manifeſt, than theſe definitions? But of whom was Matrimony inſtituted, of God, or of men?Mariage was firſte inſtituted of God. Gene. 2.
               
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Godly Matrimony was ordeined of God him ſelfe, and that in the terreſtriall Paradiſe, a place full of all ioy and pleaſure in the time of mans innocencie, and was adorned & bewtified with great miracles in Cana of Galalie, where Chriſt him ſelfe vouchedſafeIoan. 2. to be preſent at the mariage with his mother Marie the virgine, and his Diſciples, and with his diuine power turned the water into excellent good and moſt pure Wine, which was highly commended of the Maiſter of the feaſt, by whoſe preſence and miracle is plainly teſtified, that lawful mariage pleaſeth him greatly, and it is certaine that God doeth bleſſe the mariage of thoſe that feare him and call vpon him faithfully. And Saint Paul highlyMariage doth pleaſe God. commend, that holie and lawfull coupling of man and wife together, ſaying thus: Mariage is honourable among all men, and the bed vndefiled. Wherefore I may boldly and fréely affirme, that mariage is the moſt excellent ſtate and condition of life, inſtituted of God, preſerued and garniſhed with his bleſſing, which all the godly both by preaching and example haue commended vnto vs, and placed the ſame in the toppe of all good workes.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Vnto what end hath God inſtituted, this holie and lawful Matrimonie?

Thirdly, for the mutuall ſocietie, helpe and comfort, that the one ought

Prayer is moſt neceſſary in ſo great perils & daungers of life, neither is there any thing more ſéemely & pleaſant in the houſe, than to ſée & behold an honeſt & godly ſocietie, of the huſband, wife, & children, whē they ſtriue in their ſeuerall dueties, to loue cheriſh, & comfort one an other,

               The God of Iſraell, beginneth after this maner. Deut. 4. ſaying, Be not forgetfull of the words which thine eyes haue ſéene, & that they ſlip not out of thine heart, all the dayes of thy life, Thou ſhalt teach them thy ſonnes, and thy ſonnes ſonnes, ſaying, When thou ſtodeſt before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord ſaide vnto mée, gather mée the people together, and I wil make them heare

And they ſhal be warninges betwéene thine eyes, and thou ſhalt write them vpon the poſtes of thine houſe, and vpon thy gates. And in the 11.

Therefore the Prophet is not cōtent to teach the people of his time, but doeth deſire yt they might be taught vnto ye end of the world: And he doeth exhort them, yt one generation might teach & inſtruct an other. And now, albeit that very many Parents at this day (my Theophilus) do lightly regard ye teaching & inſtructing of their children: yet how earneſtly, the inſtructing of them is charged & commaunded here, your ſelf may eaſily iudge. So yt when I do bewaile ſometime the negligēce of many parents, I oft burſt out into theſe wordes.

Chaſten thy ſonne, whiles there is ſome hope of his amendement. And Saint Paule is not vnmindfull of this godly precept, ſaying:Ephe. 6. Bring vp your children in inſtruction and information of the Lorde. Paule woulde haue young men and children brought vp, firſt, by inſtruction, and then by correction in the Lorde, which reaſons and orders if they were of euery Parent diligently obſerued, it coulde not bée why at this day ſo many families (vtterly ſpoyled and ouerthrowne) ſhould bée lamented.

And againe, the children muſt be taught of the Parents that they meditate & ſtudie in the law of God, that therout they may learne the knowledge of the true God. And laſtly, that they ſubmit them ſelues vnto the ſpirite of trueth, mouing and drawing them.

                   Therefore it is the duetie of godly Parentes, to bring vp their children not to riotouſneſſe, but to modeſtie: not to ſpoile them with cockering, but to chaſten them with due correction if they offende: to prayſe them if they behaue themſelues well & obediently: to mooue them to vertue with good exhortations and faire promiſes: to feare them from vice, with rebukings, threatnings, & ſtripes if neede require: But aboue all things, let thy family whether they be children or ſeruants be taught to feare God, to loue their neighbours, to hate no body, to wiſh wel vnto all mē, & to do good to whō they may, not to remember iniuries, but to do good for euill.

The one purſued the Hare with great eagerneſſe, the other hyed as faſt to the pottage pot. But when the Lacedemonians could not yet coniecture what

hée ment thereby, nor wherfore hée brought foorth into the midſt of them, thoſe two diuers natured and nurtured Dogges: Both theſe (ſaide Licurgus) had one damme, but yet being framed and taught with vnlike vſe, the one (yée ſée) is deſirous to ſwill, glut, and fill his paunch: the other applying the chaſe, is deſirous to followe the footing of wilde beaſtes. I with that Parents would well weigh, and déepely conſider this example of Lycurgus, touching education in contrarie maner: whereof alſo Plato writeth: That a childe well and vertuouſly nurtured, is like to proue a diuine creature: but contrarily, if it be vnhappily taught, and ſuffered to run at libertie, then is hée like to proue a moſte wicked and cruell beaſt.

               What if the father ſhal ſee his childes wit, to be but dul, blockiſh, and rude, ſhal he therefore leaue of from his godly inſtructing?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Not ſo, but hée ſhall continue in his duetie without wearines,We muſt not leaue of inſtructing for the ſtupiditie of wit. with an aſſured truſt and confidence, expecting Gods aide and bleſſing: For looke what ſéemeth impoſſible to men, the ſame is poſſible with God, which ruleth and gouerneth the heartes of all men, & knoweth how to deale with them: And which loſeth the tonguesMatth. 9. Marci. 7. Num. 22. of dumbe beaſtes, yea, and that of the verie Aſſe, and maketh him to ſpeake after the maner of men. And euen as there is almoſt no beaſt found, ſo outragious, fierce, and cruel, which with the careful handling, wiſdom & diligence of the breaker cānot be tamed & made gentle: So let vs thinke no wit of man (much leſſe of a childe) ſo rude, vntoward, or paſt hope, which by diligent inſtructing, and due handling, cannot be helped, & made gentle & apt to receiue whatſoeuer is taught. Albeit a certaine Philoſopher is not altogether of this minde, which when hée had two ſchollers, the one hard & dull, but yet laborious & painfull: the other verie apt and ingenious, but yet ſlouthful & lazie: Ambo, inquit, malè pereatis, tu quum velis non potes, tu vero quum poſſis, non vis. There ſhal neither of you both take profit (ſaith he) for when thou wouldeſt thou canſt not, and when thou maieſt, thou wilt not.

               I gather now by your words, that to gouern children wel, asketh great ſkil and diligence, and chiefly by how much they are more noble in birth, and of pregnant wit: by ſo much the more harder may they bee brought

vnto the true obedience of their Parentes.

               You haue ſaid true, for to bring vp children godly, is a very hard thing, which may be ſéene in Samuel, & in other godly men. Wherefore vnto education, theſe thrée thinges chiefly are both profitable and neceſſarie: Preaching of the worde of God: feruent prayer vnto almightie God: And diſcipline, or correction of maners. Pericles,
                  In education, three things are neceſſarie. as often as hée was made Capitaine generall of the warres, was wont to ſay to himſelf, putting on his cloake or coate armor: Take héede Pericles, becauſe thou ſhalt haue authoritie, rule, and gouernment, ouer young men, both Gréekes and Athenians: with theſe wordes this wiſe man did exhort himſelfe, that hée ſhould take vpon him y• ſoueraintie or lordſhip with great moderation, & by theſe wordes hée did alſo teſtifie, that to gouerne youth well, did require great wiſedome and ſkill: Albeit in verie déede, the vulgare people are of a farre contrarie minde and opinion, which iudge that there is nothing more facile, light, or eaſie, than to gouern a family: And therefore thinke it méete and conuenient to beſtow more induſtry, paines, and diligence about their Shéepe, Swine, Horſes, Hounds and other beaſtes, than about their children and ſeruantes.

                  Socrates ſetteth downe a verie good order, ſaying: wée muſt deale with them, as wée woulde doe with thoſe Horſes, in which wée ſee great courage, good proportion of limmes, countenance & pace: if ſtraight from their tender yeares wée watch them, handle them carefully, and breake them orderly, they are like to proue excellent for the Saddle, and verie profitable to ſerue their maiſters turn, in all his exploits and néedfull buſineſſe, either for profite or pleaſure: But if they be neglected and ſuffered to runne ouer long, then they become wilde, int
                     •
                  actable, and profitable to no good vſe or purpoſe: And hereof it commeth to paſſe, that thoſe Coltes which by all ſignes were like to proue verie good and profitable, are ſpoyled by the ignoraunce and vnſkilfulnes of the breaker, which ſtraight frō good & comely horſes, are cōuerted & chaunged into very Aſſes: For

like as the earth, the better it is and more fertile by nature, the ſooner it will be ſpoiled and ouergrowne with wéedes, nettles, & bryers, if it be not orderly tilled, manured, and dreſſed: Euen ſo the forwarder and nobler wittes, except they be the better ordred and inſtructed, will the ſooner be inclined to wickednes, and obduſked, and defaced with many vices. For noble wittes if they bée well and rightly ordred and inſtructed, profite verie much, but if they be neglected, then are they a great plague vnto the common wealth: For ſéeing they holde no meane place, ſo doe they not knowe howe to obſerue any mediocritie. Quare Paedagogus Themistoclis dicere ſolebat, nil mediocre futurus es O puer, nam aut magnum bonum eris reipublicae, aut magnum malum. Wherefore the Tutor of Themistocles was wont to ſay vnto him, O my childe, thou ſhalt be no meane thing, for either thou ſhalt doe great good, or great harme to thy common wealth.
                  
               
            
            
               Theophilus.
               For that you haue ſet before vs ſo excellent and profitable admonitions for the inſtructing of children, we hartily thanke you. But yet, for that Saint Paule would haue children brought vp both with learning and correction in the Lorde, therefore wee hartily pray you, that you woulde impart vnto vs thoſe good leſſons and counſels which you haue collected touching the chaſtizing and correcting of children.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Our Lorde God in whoſe handes wée are all, which alſo louethChildren are to be corrected. our children excéedingly, prouideth for them, and kéepeth them verie carefully, which of the children of his wrath, hath made vs the children of God, and would haue vs to be the heires of his celeſtiall kingdome, through the precious blood of his dearely beloued Sonne Ieſus Chriſt: Euen the ſame God I ſay, woulde not only that our children and youthes ſhould be vertuouſly & godly brought vp and inſtructed: but would alſo haue them continually preſerued and kept vnder the ſame godly diſcipline and correction. For correction is no leſſe neceſſarie & profitable for children, than inſtruction: which theſe places doe clearely make manifeſt, that I will reſite here in order, in the which God doeth ſet foorth his will vnto vs concerning this pointe. For Solomon ſaieth: Noli ſubtrahere a
                  Prou. 23. 
                  puero tuo diſciplinam, ſi enim percuſſeris eum virga, non morietur: tu virga percuties eum & animam eius ab inferno liberabis. Withholde
                  
                  
                  not correction from thy childe, for if thou ſmiteſt him with the rodde, he ſhal not die thereof: thou ſmiteſt him with the rodde, but thou ſhalt deliuer his ſoule from hell. This ſentence doeth not only conteine a precept, but alſo a moſt comfortable promiſe. And againe: Qui diligit
                  Eccle. 30. 
                  filium ſuum, aſſiduat illi flagella, vt laetetur in nouiſſimo ſuo. Who ſo loueth his childe, holdeth him ſtil vnder correction, that he may haue ioy of him afterwarde. Tonde latera euis duminfans eſt, ne fortè induretur & non credat tibi. & erit tibi dolor animae. Hit him on the ſides while he is yet but a childe, leſt he waxe ſtubborne, & giue no more force of thee, and ſo ſhalt thou haue heauines of ſoule,
                   reade ouer this Chapiter. And in an other place Solomon ſaith: Qui parcit virgae, odit filium ſuum:
                  Pro. 13. 
                  qui antem diligit illum, instantur erudit. Hee that ſpareth the rodde, hateth his ſonne: But who ſo loueth him, holdeth him euer in nurture.
                  
               
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Seeing that our Lord God, hath commaunded vs ſo often and ſo earneſtly the chaſtening of our youthes, maruel it is, that Parents, do ſo ſpoile and marre their children with nice pampering, and too much cockering of them: and chiefly ſeeing that they are ſtirred vp vnto the performance of their dueties with moſt louing and ſweete promiſes. For to thoſe Parents, which vſe due correction vnto their children, the Lorde God doeth promiſe a ſweete and ioyful life, yea, in their old age: which benefit cannot be obteined with gold, ſiluer, nor any other treaſure though it be of neuer ſo great price or value. But yet I beſeech you in the meane tyme proceede to ſhew vnto vs thoſe godly places, in the which correction is commaunded.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               As, to thoſe Parents (which carefully perfourme their dueties in correcting their children) there are promiſed great ioyes both of bodie and minde: So they are compelled to beare and ſuffer great ſhame and griefe of minde, which without any regarde of fatherly admonitions and corrections, permit & ſuffer their childe to growe vp in all lewdneſſe and diſobedience, as by theſe texts doe appeare. Puer qui demittitur voluntati ſuae, confundit matrem ſuam, & rurſū:
                  Pro. 10. 
                  Confuſio matris est de filio indiſciplinato. The childe that is ſuffred to runne after his owne wil, doeth ſhame his mother,
                   and againe: A rude and vnmannerly ſonne, ſhal be a reproch to his mother. Dolor patris
                  
                  Eccle. 4. 
                  filius ſtultus: melior est puer pauper & ſapiens, rege ſene & ſtulto: filius ſapiēs laetificat patrem, filius vero ſtultus, maestitia eſt matris ſuae.
                  
                  A fooliſh ſonne, is the ſorrowe of his father: better is a childe poore and wiſe, than a king olde and fooliſh: A wiſe ſonne is a great ioye to his father, but a fooliſh childe, is the heauineſſe of his mother.
               
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Without doubt theſe voices of God are greatly to bee feared of negligent parentes: but yet would we be verie glad to heare of you what the auncient fathers haue left vnto their poſteritie concerning the chaſtening of children.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Saint Auguſtine teacheth manifeſtly, that children and ſeruantsAuguſtinus. are to be corrected, when hee ſaieth: Non putes te amare ſeruum, quū eum non caedis: aut tunc amare filium, quum ei non das diſciplinam: aut tunc diligere natum tuum, cum eum non corripis, non ista est charitas, ſed, languor. Thinke not that thou loueſt thy ſeruant, when thou doſt not beare him, or that then thou loueſt thy ſonne, when thou doeſt not giue him correction, for this is not loue, but languiſhing or fonde feebleneſſe, or rather fooliſh pitie.
                   And that Epiſtle which hée wrote vnto Fabius, after this maner ſheweth the ſame more plainly. Dilecto filio Fab. Augustinus Epiſcopus ſalutem. Congratulor vnà tecum, quum
                        •
                     te prolem nuper habere cognoui. Sed deprecor vt dum tempus adfuerit, caſtigare prolem non differas: nam ſicut fructus non inuenitur in arbore, in quo flos prius non apparuerit: ſic & in ſene viro, qui niſi a patre tempore adoleſcentiae in bono nutritus fuerit, tempore ſenectutis fructus bonorum operum non apparebunt: castiga igitur quem debes dum iuneneſcit. Vale. Auguſtine Biſhop, to his welbeloued ſonne Fabius, ſendeth greeting. I reioyce with you, for that I vnderſtand you haue a ſonne. But I hartily pray you, as time and occaſion ſhal ſerue, that you doe not ſpare to chaſtiſe him, For as fruite is not to bee founde in that tree, on the which bloſſomes haue not firſt appeared: So in an olde man, except hee haue beene well gouerned of his Parentes in the time of his adoleſcencie, the fruites of good workes ſhal neuer appeare in the time of his olde age: chaſtiſe him therefore whom thou oughteſt to chaſtiſe, whiles he is yet young and tender. Fare you well.
                   Theſe be his wordes. Alſo Saint Bernarde ſaieth: Non iraſci vbi iraſcendum est: est peccatum peccato
                  Bernardus. 
                  addere. Not to bee angrie, where a man ought to be angrie: is to adde one ſinne vnto an other.
                  
                  
And S. Hierom ſaieth: Parentes qui liberos ſuos non corrigunt, ſed ſinunt eos pro ſua libidine & arbitrio viuere, hi inquit etiamſ
                        •
                     fuerint alioqui ſancti & vitae inculpatae condemnabuntur. Thoſe Parentes that doe not correcte their children, but ſuffer them too runne at theyr owne will and pleaſure, theſe men ſayeth hee, albeit they ſhalbee otherwiſe Godly and of life vnrebukeable, yet ſhall they bee condemned.
                  
               
               Héerevnto doeth Innocentius aſſent and agrée, where hée ſayeth:Innoconti

                     . 
                  Parentes ſi viderint Liberos peccare, & non caſtigant, non tantum Liberi, verum & Parentes a Deo condemnabuntur. If Parentes ſhall ſee their children offende, and doe not correcte them, not onelye the Children, but alſo the Parentes of GOD ſhalbee condemned.
                  
                  Correction is neceſſary. Seneca.
                   The Ethnickes alſo in their writinges doe teſtifie and teache, that the chaſtening of Children is verie requiſite and neceſſarie, as firſt it is written in Seneca: Vitta tranſmittit ad poſteros qui praeſentibus culpis ignoſcit. Hee ſendeth vices vnto the poſtericies, which pardoneth preſent faultes and offences. And agayne hée ſayeth: Qui non vetat peccare cum poſſit, iubet. Hee whiche doeth not prohibite and forbidde to ſinne, when hee is able, commaundeth the ſame. Bonis nocet, qui malis parcit. Hee hurteth the good, which fauoureth the wicked. Ariſtotle
                   ſayeth, Nulla Belua ſuae ſponte aliquid boni agit, neque pueri. There is no beaſt doeth any good thing by the owne accorde, nature and inclination, no more doe children,
                   Therefore they are to bée admoniſhed and compelled. Wherefore Parentes ought to haue a ſpeciall care and regarde to their Children, for they are not ſuche as doe obey forA good note. ſhame, but for feare: not ſuch as doe abſtayne from wicked things, for filthineſſe ſake, but for puniſhment. Feare is to bee driuen into children, correction and puniſhment is to bée giuen, that being brought into ſome feare, they may leaue their wickedneſſe.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Oh immortall GOD howe truely haue theſe Heathen men depaynted and ſette foorth the wicked and corrupt nature of Children, and truelye it were verye good for vs, if wee had alwayes fixed before our eyes this corrupt nature of our children, but in the meane time what others haue written, touching this thing. let it not greeue you to recite vnto vs.

                  Cicero ſaith: they that thinke and iudge, that it is méete toCicero. pardon young mens faultes, are much deceiued: for becauſe that age, is no let or hinderance to good ſtudies, if therefore ſinne cannot bée remitted, then is it to bée puniſhed.

Wherefore if the father at any time heare his Childe or Seruant rapping out any execrable curſe, or deteſtable and blaſphemons othe, by and by hée ſhall rebuke and correct him, that hée may vnderſtande that it is a foule fault and vitious thing and that hée take greater héede to his ſpéech and tongue, vpon the paine that thereof ſhall enſue.
               
                  And let him bée admoniſhed alſo of the Angels of GOD ſtanding by him which cannot endure nor abide ſuch things: and if the Angelles for ſuch filthie and Diabolicall curſing and blaſphemie bee compelled to execute puniſhment of thoſe offendors how ſhall the Almighty GOD ſuffer the ſame, which ſéeth and knoweth all thinges? Therefore the moſte ſharpe and terrible wrath of God muſt alwayes be ſet before our eyes, leaſt lightly and negligently we regard the inſtruction of our youth.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               You haue moſt perfectlie and playnelie ſhewed vs, that children ſhoulde not onelye bee inſtructed, but alſo corrected, and you haue confirmed the ſame as well by the Scriptures, as by the GodlieFathers abuſe their authorities. Fathers and Wiſe Ethnickes. But nowe a dayes wee ſee and knowe among Fathers of Families, not a fewe which too filthily and ſhamefully doe abuſe their power and authoritie: and are in correcting their children, ſo ireful, fierce and cruel, that they ſeeme to vſe a tyrannical power, rather then that a man would thinke they haue anye naturall and fatherly affection towardes them. Wherefore wee earneſtly beſeeche you that you woulde briefly deſcribe vnto vs, the manner and order howe to chaſtice them, leaſt that when wee woulde performe the duties of good and naturall Parentes, wee playe the partes of vnnaturall wicked Tyrantes.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               For that hitherto (as is conuenient) you haue made ſo greate accompt of the holie Scriptures, and opinions of Godlie men, and with ſo greate reuerence imbraced the ſame: Therefore héere ſhall you heare not myne, but the moſte Godly and wiſe anſweares of Solomon, which ſayeth: Chaſten thy Sonne whileProu. 19. there is yet hope: but let not thy ſoule bée mooned to ſlay him, for greate wrath bringeth muche harme. Againe hée ſayeth PuniſhmentesEphe. 6. are ordayned for the ſcornefull, and ſtripes for fooles backes. And Saint Paule ſayeth, Fathers prouoke not your children to wrath.Ambroſe. And Saint Ambroſe alſo teacheth after what manner children are to bée corrected, ſaying, Leuiter caſtigatus exhibet reuerentiam caſtiganti, qui vero crudeliter caſtigatur vel increpatur, nec increpationem ſuſcipit nec ſalutem. A child that is gently and eaſily corrected, yeeldeth
                  
                  
                  reuerence vnto his corrector▪ but who ſo is cruelly chaſtened and rebuked, doeth neither admit rebuke, nor receiue health nor amendment. And Seneca writeth, Cordatorum eſſe parentum, filios obiurgare citra
                  Seneca. 
                  contumeliam, & laudare citra adulationem: quamobrem curare debent parentes vt filii eos reuereantur ob vita ſeueritatem, & ament ob morū iocunditatem caſtigandi quidem ſunt filii: verum paternè, non tyrannicè. It is the part of wiſe parents, to rebuke their children without contumely, checke or taunt, and to prayſe them without flattery or adulation: wherefore parents ought to haue great regard vnto this, that their children reuerence them for their grauitie of life, and loue them for the pleaſantneſſe of their maners, truely children are to be corrected, but yet fatherly, not tyrannouſly.
                  
               
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Was there euer Parenes at any time, that haue been moued with ſuch wrath, crueltie, or rather madneſſe, which haue exceeded the bounds and limits of their function and dutie in chaſtening, and haue vſed themſelues like Tyrants: towards their children?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Yea, in Titus Liuius is deſcribed at large, the tyrannie of LuciusThe tirannie of L. M. Manilius, the which againſt all equitie and againſt the lawe of armes commaunded his ſonne to bee beheaded. Wee reade alſoAxio the noble Romaine paſſed the boundes of his duetie in correcting his ſonne. that Axio a Noble Romane, whipped and ſcourged his ſonne in ſuche cruell manner that hee dyed thereof preſently? whome (through the indignation of which cruell and horrible fact, when all people as well Parents as Children were gathered togeather, and woulde haue ſlayne hym with their penciels or bodkins in the market place) Auguſtus Caeſar with all his authoritie and power (though very great) coulde ſcarſcely ſaue▪ and deliuer out of their hands.
               Wherefore Parents ought to traine vp their Children ſo warily and wiſely, that they beate them not like Aſſes: nor that they ſpoile them with cockeringe or dallyinge with them like Whelpes. But that they goe directly in the middeſt admoniſhing them, ſometime with prayſes, ſometime with ſeueritie, as the mater & time doeth require & miniſter occaſion vnto them.

For Parents muſt obſerue and kéepe the golden meane, leaſt thatA meane in correcting is beſt. they amaſe their children with too muche threatning: diſcourage them with their two ſharpe and bitter reproches: or with their rigor and crueltie to kill and murder them: which great faultes and errors haue ſo preuailed in thoſe which haue ſuppoſed and iudged that threatninges and ſtripes, are the beſt meanes and readieſt way to bring their children to vertue and learning: whereas on the contrary part, it hath put them very often in ſuch ſeare, amazedneſſe and terror, that it coulde hardly bée remoued from them when they haue attained vnto mature and riper yeeres. For as too much drowth doeth wither, dry vp, and kyll the young plantes and graffes: euen ſo doeth too ſharpe and auſtere ſeueritie kill the heartes of young men. It were good for Parents to kéepe alwaies in remembrance thoſe good leſſons of Phocilides, which ſaith: Filiis ne difficilis ſis tuis, ſed mitis eſto. Sine contumeliaplectito quibus praees. In filium iram non bonus nutrit pater.
               
               
                  Bee not too ſharpe to children deare, but vſe a modeſt checke,
                  And ouer whom thou haſt a charge. without reproch correct:
                  Good parents will not foſter vp, their wrath againſt their childe:
                  But rather ſeeke their mendment with their counſels graue and milde.
               
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Wherefore and with what purpoſe and intent ought children to bee corrected?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               
                  Aguſtine, ſaith, Nemo prudens punit, quia peccatum eſt, ſed ne peccetur.
                  
                     Auguſtine giueth a reaſon with what intente children ſhould bee corrected. 
                  Res eſt enim optima non ſceleratos omnino extirpare, ſed ſcelera. There is no wiſe man that correcteth and puniſheth an offendor, becauſe of the offence which is committed: but rather leaſt hee or any other ſhoulde offende againe by the like example. For it is not alwaies the beſt way, vtterly to extirpe and roote out the malefactors and offendors, but rather their haynous and wicked offences,
                   that they may bée amended and brought to a better order of life.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               What ſhoulde the father thinke vpon, while he is correcting his child?
            
            
               
               Theodidactus
               It ſhall greatly mittigate and aſſwage the rage aud fury ofWhat the father ſhoulde think vpon whiliſt he is in correcting. our mindes, if wée heare in memory this ſaying of Plinie, which after this maner doeth admoniſhe a ſharpe, ſeuere, and cruell father, that hée ſhoulde not deale with his ſonne or handle hym too ſharpely or rigorouſly, ſaying: Et illum adolenſcentulum eſſe, & te fuiſſe cogita: atque in hoc quod pater es, enitere, vt memineris te hominem, & hominis patrem. Way and conſider this, that hee is a young man, and alſo that thou haſt beene one thy ſelfe. And further in as muche as thou art a father, call to thy minde that thou art nowe a man, and the Father of one that may bee a man heereafter.
                  
               
            
            
               Theophilus.
               A very excellent and wiſe way ſurely to pacifie and quiet the furious and raging mindes of Parentes, when they ſhall correct theyr children. And in my iudgement there is no man that coulde haue giuen more wholeſome or better counſel concerning this matter, wherefore it is worthie of all men to bee followed. Not withſtanding I my ſelfe haue knowne ſume furious parentes a brode, which haue vſed to ſtrike and buffet their children about the face and head, and to lay vpon them like Mault ſackes with cudgels, ſtaues, forke or fire ſhouel, or whatſoeuer came nigheſt their handes, yea, and very often alſo, haue caſt them on the grounde, and ſpurned and kickt them like dogs, which maner of correcting I iudge is vtterly to bee deteſted and abhorred, neither do I think it lawfull by any meanes that they ſhould vſe them after ſuch order. Wherefore I pray you tell vs, how ſhould they bee admoniſhed and perſwaded, that heereafter they doe not vſe and handle their children and ſeruants after ſuche raging, furious, and beaſtly maner.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Firſt and chiefly, wée muſt ſhewe them and ſet before them, the moſt pure and ſacred worde GOD, for theſe men peraduenture (béeing ſo waywarde, fierce, and cruell as you haue ſaide) woulde vtterly contemne and deſpiſe mens reaſons, wiſdome and counſell.
               But y• Lord our God of his vnſpeakeable good will and fauour towardes vs, doeth ſo dearely loue parents, and ſo tenderly prouide

for their children, that hée doeth not onely commaunde them to correct their children, but being very deſirous and willing to cure and remedie ſuche rage and furie, deeth alſo ſhew vnto vs, what inſtrument is méete, and what wée ought to vſe and exerciſe in correcting.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               With what matter or inſtrument I pray you ought children to bee corrected?
            
            
               Theodidactus,
               The Lord our God by Solomon doth teache euery where that
                     Prouer. 13. Children ſhuld bee corrected with the rodde. children ſhoulde bée beate with the rodde, ſaying after this maner, Withholde not correction from thy Childe, for if thou ſhalte ſmite hym with the rodde, hée ſhall not die thereof: Thou ſmiteſt him with the rodde, but thou ſhalt deliuer his ſoule from Hell.
               And againe, who ſo ſpareth the rodde, marreth his childe. Loe héere, not that wiſe Solonion, doeth teache that children ought to bée corrected with the rodde, but the Lorde our God himſelfe which hath ſpokē by the mouthes of his holy prophets, whoſe worde abideth for euer.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               If theſe fooliſhe, harebrayned, and raſhe Parents woulde heare and willingly obey and followe this little admonition, then ſhoulde they not haue, ſo many deafe, blockiſhe, fooliſhe, bleere eyed, and alſo oftentimes madde children as they haue: which diſcommodities we ſee come very often, by the continuall and vnreaſonable beating and buffetting of them about the heads, as I ſaid before.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               You gather and apply all thinges very rightly. For if Parentes woulde not beate their young and tender children with their harde fiſtes vpon their eares and heades, but in ſtéede thereof, and of their Cudgels, Staues, and ſuche like, (according to the counſell of Solomon) woulde take and vſe the rodde, then ſhoulde they haue wherein they might reioyce and become the parents of wiſe and worthie children, whereas contrary wiſe they are compelled will they, nill they, to haue the gouernment of deaf

lumpiſhe, ignorant and fooliſhe children all the dayes of their life, to their great ſorrowe and griefe very often.
            
            
               Theophilus
               Whereas I haue nowe begunne to mooue you with my queſtions I knowe not yet where or howe to make an ende, ſeeing therefore you haue alredie ſhewed vnto vs the inſtrument where with children ſhould be corrected and admoniſhed that they ſhoulde not bee beaten about the heads. Nowe I beſeeche you ſhew vs, where and on what part of the body they ſhould be beaten.

                   Beholde here the clemencie and prouidence, beholde héere I ſay the excéeding great mercy of God, which also hath vouchſafed to ſhewe and manifeſt vnto vs that part of the body, which hee would haue beaten▪ leaſt at any time either wée our ſelues, or our little children ſhoulde ſuſtaine any loſſe, perill or diſpleaſure by meanes of our correction.
            
            
               Theophilus
               Wherefore are parents compelled to bee ſo diligent, carefull and prouident, in the inſtructing and chaſtening of their children, and what is the ende of this ſo great labour and trauaile?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               They ſhall inſtruct, nurture and chaſten their children, not to the ende that they might ſet them forwarde and promote them toThe end wh

And this end and maner of training vp of youth is moſt profitable and excellent of all others: wherein all godly parents ought to haue their chiefeſt pleaſure and felicitie. For Parents ouer and beſides that naturall loue & affection which nature

Let them temper and bridle the auſteritie, ſharpneſſe and rage of their authoritie and power, with ſuch affection and deſire of lenitie, gentleneſſe and mildneſſe, and ſo rebuke and chide the offender, that they had rather to haue them corrected and amended, then puniſhed or tormented: and let them rather endeuour to withold and draw them from future faultes and offences, than rigorouſly to execute puniſhment of their faultes preſently committed.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               The greateſt part of the welfare and proſperitie of children, doeth depend (as farre as I perceiue) of the good inſtruction and diligent and wiſe chaſtening of parents.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               It is very true: for the Lorde our God hath commaunded that children ſhoulde honour and obey their parents, and in the ſame commaundement alſo hée hath giuen a charge vnto the Parents, that they ſhould perfourme and do their duetie (that is to ſay) that they teach & inſtruct their children in the true knowledge of God, and bring them vp in the feare of the Lord. For howe ſhall the children perfourme their dueties towardes their Parents, if that parents ſhall firſt neglect their dueties towardes their children? And albeit the ſlouth and negligence of parents doeth not excuſe the wickedneſſe and impietie of children before God, notwithſtanding parents owe this duetie to their children, that they prouide for them not only corporall foode for their bodies: but much rather ſpirituall foode and nouriſhment for their ſoules, if otherwiſe they couet and deſire to haue them ſaued.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               But if after all wholeſome admonitions and councels, inſtructions and chaſtiſements, they remain ſtubborn & diſdaineful children, & do receiue

no godly admonition, nor wil ſuffer nor abide any correction, what doe you thinke is meete to be done with ſuch, and howe ſhould a man deale them?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Such ſtubborne, wicked, and rebellious wretches are firſt to be diſpoiled, and depriued of all their poſſeſſions and inheritance, and that by the authoritie of the lawes written.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               How many cauſes be there ſet down, of ingratitude, contumacie, ſtubbornneſſe and diſobedience, for which a father may diſherite his ſonne?

               Theodidactus.
               Truely, it is an harde and fearfull ſentence, wherout all young men may gather, as is méet for them, how great the wrath of God is againſt the ſinne of diſobedience. Neither doeth the law of God only hate and deteſt ſuch ſtubborne and rebellious children: But alſo the verie Ethnickes would haue them caſt off from their parentes, and to be vtterly diſpoſſeſſed, which Ariſtippus teacheth by an excellent Apophthegme, after this maner: A certaine man accuſing him for that hee ſo caſt off his ſonne and contemned him, as though hée had neuer begot him: hée ſaieth, Doe wée not caſtDegenerate children are to be caſt of & forſaken. away from vs, our ſpittle, lice, and ſuch like, as thinges vnprofitable, which neuertheleſſe are ingendred and bread euen out of our owne ſelues? His minde and iudgement is, that they are not to bée accounted for children, whiche otherwiſe haue nothing in them, whereby they might commende them ſelues to the loue and effection of their Parentes, but only that they be by them begotten. So the olde father Menedemus, to his ſonne Clinia, (brought in by the Poet Terence, in his third Comedie) ſpeaketh after this maner: Ego te meum dici tantiſper volo, dum id quod te dignum est facias.
               
               
                  So long and no longer, ſhalt thou be my ſonne,
                  As thou behaueſt thy ſelfe with diſcretion.
               
               Thus did the verie Heathen men (which had not the law of God to direct them as wée haue) handle their degenerate and diſobedient children, whom God woulde haue alſo to be an example vnto vs.

From whence as out of a moſt ſweete and pure fountaine, al other vertues doe flowe.
               
                  Nowe (if it ſeeme good vnto your curtiſie) wee would bee right glad and verie willing to heare and learne of you, what a Sea of euils, dammages, calamities, and perils, this negligent and corrupt inſtruction of Parentes doeth bring with it.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Concerning this negligent inſtruction of children, there are ſo many waightie and graue ſayings, and ſuch horrible and fearefull examples euerie where, as well in the holy ſcriptures, as alſo in other godly Authours, and Heathen writers, that if I ſhould goe about to ſhewe and declare vnto you euery thing that I haue reade and noted, touching the ſame, a whole day would not ſuffice. But becauſe the thing is ſo reaſonable, which you doe demaund of mée, I will ſatiſfie your requeſt, what I may conueniently.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               If oportunitie and leyſure doe not ſerue, to ſhewe vs euerie thing as you wiſh, yet at the leaſt, you wil vouchſafe wee pray you, to recite ſuche thinges as may ſeeme more ſharply to admoniſhe, and as it were, compell negligent Parentes, that (at the laſt, this filthie drowſineſſe, and pernitious negligence being ſhaken off,) they may more diligently and carefully diſcharge their dueties.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Men might eaſily be drawne to the duties of their vocation andAgainſt negligent parents. calling, if they were throughly perſuaded, and woulde beléeue that their children are the gift of God, and that they are the pledges of God him ſelfe, neither néeded they any compulſion in this matter: But rather verie willingly, and of their owne accords, would they credit and beléeue, that theſe pledges of God, ought with great care and diligence to be preſerued, inſtructed, and corrected: For it they ſhall be neglected, ſpoiled, or loſt by their meanes and ſufferaunce, then ſhall they be required at the handes of the Treaſuror and kéeper. Nowe for example ſake, a King or Emperour, hath his Treaſurer, or ſome one of his Priuie Chamber, to whom hée committeth many thinges of great charge and value, to be kept, preſerued, and diligently looked vnto. Suppoſe and thinke it to be a precious Crowne, moſt worthie for a Prince, the Imperiall Scepter, Letters Pattentes, precious Stones, Pearles, Iewels, and other riche and coſtly Robes, which are moſte commonly woont to be in kings and Emperours palaces.

But if this Chamberlayne or Treaſurer ſhall neglect his duetie and office, or ſpoile and loſe thoſe moſt precious Iewels and ornaments of the King or Emperour. Then ſhall hée not only loſe his office, but alſo be depriued and diſpoiled of all his poſſeſſions, goods, and Cattels, and beſides, that ſuffer moſt extreame puniſhment. Euen ſo our Lorde God, which is King of Kinges, and Lorde of Lordes, after that hée hath created our children, & with his owne precious blood hath redéemed them, and committed them to our truſt and kéeping, to be carefully gouerned, and diligently inſtructed. So that if the ChamberlayneArgumentū a ſimile. or a Treaſurer of a King or Emperour, for the loſſe of the Crown or Iewell (which is only bought with Gold or ſiluer) be ſo ſharply and ſeuerely puniſhed? What ſhall become of thoſe Parentes, which

                  o negligently regard the giftes and pledges of God (which coſt neither ſiluer nor Golde, but were purchaſed and bought with the ineſtimable and that moſt precious blood of his dearly beloued Sonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt) and with too much libertie ſuffer them to be ſpoyled? Surely ſuch Parentes ought to feare, exſpect and looke for none other puniſhments, than euerlaſting tormentes. Wherefore, or what was the cauſe that Heli the high Prieſt in Iſraell ſuffered puniſhment? But only for that his children1. Regum. 2. 4. had ſo excéedingly offended the Maieſtie of God: In this example, Parentes ought to looke and learne the feare of God, and ſhake of this ſluggiſhneſſe, ſlouth and negligence in trayning vp their children. For it is the promiſe of God, that the Angels of children doe alwayes beholde the face of God our Father which is in heauen.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               If children be ſo precious and highly eſteemed of God, that hee thinketh them woorthie to bee preſerued of Angelles, and that they bee the pledges of God, why ſhoulde wee not care for them, and inſtruct them diligently?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Foraſmuch as the whole ſtate & proſperitie of mans life doeth altogether depend & ſtay vpon the godly educatiō of children: why

ſhould the right ordring and gouerning of children be ſo neglected? which if it be negligently and careleſly looked vnto, doeth not only bring great miſerie, plagues, and deſtruction, vnto the Parents them ſelues, but alſo to the common ſocietie, and neighborhood of all men. Wherefore this one thing ought greatly to ſtirre and moue vs, (that is to ſay) the dignitie of children, with the which God vouchethſafe to adorne and garniſh them.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               But yet this one thing reſteth, from whence, I pray you, do you think, this negligence of Parentes, and this corruption of children doeth chiefly ſpring and growe? and that they conſume and ſpende their force and ſtrength in the perpetrating and committing all kynde of wickedneſſe?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Too much cockering and pampering of fooliſh Parentes, ICockering is the originall cauſe of negligent inſtruction. indge to be the originall cauſe of this ſo great a miſchiefe. For that too much cockering and ſufferaunce, maketh their mindes (as a certaine wiſe man ſaieth) ſo wanton, nice, and tender, that within a while, they become apt to no goodneſſe, and ſildome prooue honeſt men, or fit members for their countrie and common wealth.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               You haue ſaide as true as may bee: But yet al this while cannot I vnderſtande nor perceiue, that Parentes, which both by the lawes of God and man, doe owe ſuch loue, godly inſtruction, chaſtiſement, and all other dueties of godlineſſe and beneuolence to their children, howe they can giue them ſelues to ſuch follie, or rather madneſſe, that they vtterly ſpoile and deſtroy their children, with that too much cockering & wantonneſſe?

                     yed. I will open and make the matter more manifeſt vnto you. When they are admoniſhed of their duetie, they will anſwere, and ſay, that their childe can perceiue as yet verie litle or nothing by reaſon of his age, and they ſay truely: No more can the Spaniell or blood Hounde, the Horſe or Mule vnderſtande what they ought to doe, neuertheleſſe they learne to goe, to come, to followe, to carrie, to recarrie, to doe, and to leaue vndone, to watch, to

finde out, and ſuch lyke thinges, which they vnderſtand not: Alſo, neither doeth the wood or ſtone vnderſtande, that it is a fooliſh and abſurde thing, towardes the building and framing of an houſe: but after it is hewen, faſhioned, and framed of the Artificer and worke maiſter, by and by hée vnderſtandeth where vntoo eche thing ſhall ſerue in his due place and time. Nowe, foraſmuch as theſe thinges which lacke reaſon, can be taught and framed to ſo many good purpoſes: Howe muche more a reaſonable creature, which is created to the Image of God? Surely I wiſhe you ſhoulde weigh and conſider this with your ſelfe: if other mens children perceiue and vnderſtande verie many thinges. Why ſhoulde not yours vnderſtande ſome thinges in the wayes of vertue and godlineſſe: Vndoubtedly, if you will not teach them, but ſtill pamper them with too much cockering and delicate niceneſſe, you ſhall anſwere and beare the ſinnes and offences of your children. And howe ſharpely and ſeuerely the Lorde God executeth puniſhment for the contemptuous bringing vp of children, onely Heli the high Prieſt with his ſonnes, may be for an example (as i
                     •
                   ſaide before) which miſerably finiſhed their liues. Hée, for that hée ſpoiled his children with too much libertie: they, for becauſe they would not hearken to, nor obey the counſels and admonitions of their father, though verie gentle, light and eaſie.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Did Heli then the high Prieſt in Iſrael, offende the Maieſtie of God, being ſo woorthie a man, with too much cockering of his children? And yet I remember, hee did reproue them verie often.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               The voyce of God teſtifieth otherwiſe, which ſoundeth after1. Regum. 3. this manner: I haue tolde him that I will iudge his houſe for euer: becauſe his children did curſe God, and followed Beliall, and hée would not chaſten and correct them: Therefore haue I ſworne vnto the houſe of Heli, that the wickedneſſe of Helies houſe, ſhall not be purged with ſacrifice and burnt offringes, for euer.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Verely this voice of God ought greatly to bee feared of all Parentes: For if the iniquitie of Heli ſo woorthie a man, and of ſo hygh

calling, could not be purged for euer, which notwithſtanding ſometymes corrected his ſonnes, and ſeemed willing to cleanſe and purge their ſinnes and offences with certaine ſacrifices and oblations. What ſhal bee done with them? which ſcarcely at any time haue chaſtened their children neyther in worde nor deede, neither doe they once beleeue that God wil execute puniſhment of ſo great wickedneſſe, it is ſo farre from them, that they are willing to bewayle and lament, this ſo great a faulte, with true ſorow and vnfayned teares.

               Wée deny not, that Heli the Prieſt reprooued his ſonnes dooing
                     Heli ſuffereth the puniſhment of his negligent inſtruction. wickedly, but yet hée reprooued them not earneſtly and ſharply, but lightly and tenderly, as many Parentes vſe to doe now adayes (the more to be lamented.) And therefore, that good and godly father, ſuffred payne for the iniquitie of his ſonnes, by which example, ſuche negligent Parentes ought with good cauſe to bée moued, or if this doe not moue them, yet mée thinkes this ſaying of Paule ſhoulde rowſe them vp, and ſhake of all their drowſineſſe, which ſaieth: Si quis ſuorum & maximè domesticorum non

                     . one, becauſe it is worthie the noting. Marcus Tul. Cicero, in the Oration which hée made againſt Verres, in his firſt booke, among many other thinges whiche hee obiected vnto him by way of reproch, this is one and the chiefeſt, that hée had ſo trayned vp his ſonne, that hée had neuer ſéene, chaſt, ſhamefaſt, or ſober feaſt or banquet, for the ſpace of thrée yeares togethers, but was euer conuerſaunt and in company with wanton Harlottes, and vnchaſt women, and with riotous Kuffians, and intemperate men, ſo that if hée had any deſire to be good, yet could hée not eſcape from them either wiſer or better.

By meanes whereof ſaith hée, thou haſt not only wrought greate iniurie to thy ſonne, but alſo to the common wealth: Suſceperas
                  Negligent parents are iniurious to their countrie and common welth. 
                  enim liberos non ſolum tibi, ſed etiam patriae. For thou haſt begot children not only for thy ſelfe, but alſo for thy countrie.

And thou oughteſt to inſtruct and traine them vp in the knowledge and vnderſtanding of graue and waightie matters, as the quiet gouernment of people in publike aſſemblies, of Ciuile gouernment in Cities, Townes, and other affaires of the common wealth, that loue and neighbored might bée mainteined, and not after their owne lewde luſtes and wantonneſſe, and licentious libertie. Thus muche of Cicero to Verres, touching his ſonne. A very Chriſtian ſaying of an Heathen man, and meete for all men to bée ſet on the outwarde poſtes of their doores, in their bed Chambers and cloſets, or rather after the maner of the Hebrewes, that all fathers and mothers ſhould haue them on their philacteries, & ſkirtes of their veſtures, and to bée written in golden letters.

               I doe not ſo much maruel, that ſuch corrupters of youth were found amongſt the Heathen which liued without the light of the Goſpel, and true knowledge of God: but that this chaunceth very often amongeſt thoſe men, which boaſt themſelues to bee good and perfect Chriſtians, this is much rather to bee maruelled at, and by no meanes to bee ſuffered.

Mothers take no regarde, no care of their daughters, but winke at their faultes, ſuffer them to rome abrode, ſeeke their amendment by no milde nor moderate correction, neither doe they perſwade them vnto ſobrietie, mildneſſe, nor modeſtie, with their wholeſome admonitions and motherly counſels. Wee haue greater care, and will take more paines a great deale about any thing els, then about the godly education of our children. I am perſwaded that God is greatly offended with vs, euen for this one fault, that wee deale ſo negligently with our children, and caſt the raines of al libertie and looſeneſſe into their owne necks after this maner:

For as wee woulde haue them proue when they ſhal bee men and women, ſo muſte wee deale with them and inſtruct them in their greene and tender yeeres. So that whereas many things fall out amongeſt vs chriſtians ſo vntowardly and peruerſly touching the diſobediēce of our youth nowe adayes, I iudge one chiefe cauſe to come, growe and proceede from this, that there are ſo few which take ſuch paines and diligent care as they ought to doe, for their godly and vertuous training vp, And albeit better is to bee hoped for, yet certainely this is ſtill to bee expected and looked for from Children, that they wyll growe worſe and worſe, except Godly inſtruction bee ioyned with moderate correction.

               Without all doubt a horrible puniſhment remaineth to ſuche Parents, which ſo negligently contemne and deſpiſe their owne naturall children, beſides that it is a very great negligence, or rather a horrible miſchiefe, either to caſt the bridle into the neckes of young men, or to corrupt and ſpoyle them with wicked inſtruction or their owne lewde and naughtie examples. Neuertheleſſe how common theſe thinges are in mans life, it is too manifeſt: when Parents or Teachers are either Epicures, or otherwiſe lewde and licentious liuers, and doe not exerciſe their children and ſeruants vnto the knowledge and feare of God, but oftentimes doe nouriſh and confirme them in wicked, erronious and deteſtable opinions: theſe miſchiefes are to bée puniſhed no doubt, as God hymſelfe ſaith: Contemnentes me, reddam contemptos, I will make my contemners, contemned and deſpiſed.

               O twiſe, yea thriſe happie are thoſe parents, which doe not vainely & negligently heere theſe and ſuch like threatnings, but proceede and go forward I pray to recite other places, wherin God doth threatē, lither ſlouthful and negligent parents.

               Fathers and maiſters which withholde their children and families from hearing and learning the worde of God, by commanding and appointing them in the meane time ſome other buſines, or els by reaſon of their ignorance or impietie haue no care or regarde, to bée taught and trayned vp in true godlineſſe, are not only

wicked and iniurious to themſelues, but alſo to their whole families, ſo that ſuche ſhall receiue double the greater condenination. It is ſet downe in the Decalogue or tenne Commaundementes, That children woulde honour their Parents, but with what face dare that Father exact of his child the honour commaunded of God in the ſecond Table, when as hée himſelfe doth not perfourme his owne duetie, which in the firſt Table of the Commaundements is required of him, touching the due honour of God, and the ſanctifying of the Sabboth day? Children are not borne of their parents at auenture, but they bée the gift and bleſſing of God. The Scripture ſaith, God bleſſed them & ſaid: Creſcite & multiplicamini. Encreaſe and multiplie.
                   And the Pſalmograph ſaith: Filii tui ſicut nouellae
                  Children are the bleſſinge of God. 
                  Oliuarum in circuitu menſae tuae: Ecoe ſic benedicetur homo qui timet dominū. Thy children ſhalbe like the Oliue branches round about thy Table: Beholde, thus ſhall the man bee bleſſed that feareth the Lord.
                   Children are giuen vnto Parents by the diuine and Almightie power of God, and are committed vnto them as an heauēly treaſure, not to the end that they ſhoulde bée prophaned and brought vp only to the vſe of this terreine and earthly Citie, but that they ſhould bée ſanctified & hallowed vnto the vſe of the heauenly Ieruſalem, wée haue loſt in our firſt Parent the right of our heauenly life & inheritance, and wée are borne the children of Gods wrath, death and hell.

               Parentes are not to be compelled, ſpecially thoſe which haue béene once baptized and taken vpon them the name of Chriſtians, thoſe I ſay, ought not to be compelled and forced by the rigour of any lawe, but rather a fatherly affection, loue and deſire, ſhouldeIf the feare and loue of God will not cauſe Parentes to be careful for their children: much leſſe will any lawe that can be deuiſed by men. moue them vnto ſo godly and diuine a worke.

Hée that once repoſeth his whole truſt and confidence in God, and loueth him with all his heart, munde, and ſoule: Howe is it poſſible, but that hée will ſhewe, ſet foorth and declare in like maner, his excéeding great benefites receiued from time to time? chiefly to his children and domeſticall ſeruants? But who ſo neither beléeueth nor loueth God, nor his worde, what ſhall hée be able to teach vnto his family, albeit hée be compelled a hundreth times by any lawe preſcribed? There ſéemeth therefore to be no reaſon, why ſuch a lawe ſhoulde be ordeined and ſet foorth by any Magiſtrate.

               I doe not altogether miſlike or deſpiſe your opinion, notwithſtandingWhat is the chiefe of mans felicitie? in the meane time, I thinke and iudge that it is not vnprofitable if ſuche negligent Parentes ſhould be admoniſhed, and the rather, for becauſe the good & vertuous education of children, is a thing ſo worthie & ſo neceſſarie, that if a man wil account it the verie fountaine and whole ſumme of mans felicitie, I iudge hee ſhould not be greatly deceiued. And if I be not deceiued, I thinke I haue either heard or read, that there was a lawe ſet foorth againſt thoſe corruptors of youth, and that of Solon, the lawe

maker among the Athenians.
               
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               It is euen ſo in déed, you haue read and remembred very well, Solon, that moſt wiſe lawe maker ſet foorth a ſore ſharpe and greeuous lawe, to kéepe Parents in their dueties, and they tooke great care of their childrē to be kept according to the preſcript rule of the ſame, So that if they had let paſſe or forgot any thing, & being mooued either with couetouſnes or any other wickednes, had violated and broken the good purpoſe and meaning of the lawe, touching the education and inſtructing of their children. There were paynes

Moreouer, their lawful authoritie was taken from them, which nature by the lawe of humanitie had giuen them, and that the childe did owe to his father: For neither was hée compelled to regard nor reuerence ſuch a one, nor to ſuſtaine, cheriſhe, comfort or relieue him with his goods or mony, no though hée were poore, ſicke, féeble, or indigent. To conclude, who ſo did not throughly perfourme the office and duetie of a good father towards his childe, the lawe would not that any duetie ſhould remaine & abide in his force & authoritie from the childe either of naturall loue and affection, or of a thankfull and willing minde towardes ſuch a father.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               It was an extreame lawe, and they were greeuous paines no doubt, which would haue all humanitie, authoritie, and loue (which is due vnto Parentes) to be as it were extinguiſhed & vtterly rooted out of the hearts of children. Theſe thinges doe not conſent and agree to your minde and opinion.

               They doe diſſent & diſagrée from mine opinion, I muſt néedes confeſſe: but yet I affirme that thoſe Parents are not to be cōſtrained, which haue profeſſed them ſelues Chriſtians, and which haue béene truely taught and inſtructed in the true faith and knowledge of God, and are not altogether

Solon, though hée were anThe Ethnickes are to be compelled one way, but the Chriſtians an other way. excellent wiſe man, yet did he want the true fayth and knowledge of Chriſt, Alſo, the Athenians for whom hée made that lawe, were in lyke manner Heathen men, altogether voyde of the true knowledge, loue, feare, inuocation, and fayth of the true liuing God, for the Ethnickes are to be compelled one way, but Chriſtians after an other manner.

               But if there be founde nowe amongſt the Chriſtians ſome, which are no leſſe guiltie in this fault, than the vnfaithfull Athenians in time paſt: were it not good and verie conuenient to compel ſuch wicked and negligent Parents?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               When I ſée thoſe Parentes offende as gréeuouſly (which notwithſtanding glorie and boaſt them ſelues to be dipped and dyed in the blood of Chriſt) as the Infidels, and haue as litle care and regarde of their children: And are not only equall with the Gentils, but alſo doe farre excéede them in that faulte, I might eaſily bée perſuaded, that they ſhoulde bée vrged and conſtrained vnto their dueties: For albeit litle fruite from them were to be looked for, yet this lawe might be an example vnto others, which might be excited and ſtirred vp, vnto a greater diligence and carefulneſſe towardes their children, and chiefly when they did heare the inſtruction and vertuous education of children ſo earneſtly commaunded of God: which when it is rightly taught, ſetteth foorth the glorie of God excéedingly, and is moſt neceſſarie and profitable as wel to the common wealth generally, yea as alſo to all families perticularly. Wherefore as I haue often ſayde héeretofore, ſo I now ſay againe, that diligent care and regard is to be had about this firſt age: which the porche and entraunce of life, ſheweth it ſelfe, as it were, a certeine platforme, and frame or whole building of the yeares following.

               For that you haue ſo diligently diſſolued this doubt, and ſo plainly declared and made manifeſt this queſtion vnto vs, we haue to reioyce and giue you hartie thankes, If I remember wel the matter going before, you proued by the teſtimonies of godly & learned men, that Parēts run in great daunger which ſhal not bring vp and chaſten their children vertuouſly and

               This doubt is eaſily diſcuſſed, if we will giue credite to the holy ſcriptures: For if the lord God doth require the blood at the hand of the watchmam, for that he will not ſhew vnto his neighbour his offence and treſpaſſe, that hée might be conuerted vnto the Lorde: How much rather will the Lorde God require the blood of children at the hands of thoſe Parents, which wil not declare and ſhew the wayes of God vnto their owne children, and when they offend and wander a ſtray, will not reduce and bring them againe into the right way, and chaſten their offences:

               Parents ſhal take héed diligently, that they liue godly among their children and family, and that they bring them vp in the feare and the information of the Lorde, and a greater patrimonie than this, can they not leaue vnto them. But if they them ſelues ſhallHow the children beare the ſinnes of the Parents. liue vngodly, and their children ſhall commit the lyke wickedneſſe receiued from them, they them ſelues ſhall not only be accurſed, but alſo their children ſhall inherite the curſe of their Parentes: Not that the children if they repent, doe beare the ſinnes of their Parentes, but that whereas the ſame wickedneſſe is and ſhall bée committed of the father and the ſonne, there it muſt néedes be, that there ſhall be a lyke puniſhment of the vngodlineſſe. And the Lorde ſayeth, Exod. 20. I am the Lorde thy God, a mightie, and a iealous God, viſiting the ſinnes of the fathers vpon the children, vnto the third and foorth generation, of thoſe that hate mée, &c. In theſe wordes Parents and children doe heare, that Parents ought to take great héed that they ſin not againſt God, that their childrenChildren may not deride their Parents. Gene. 9. alſo learn not to ſin, & ſo of God be remoued & deſtroied frō their poſterities. Childrē ought not to deride & offend their parēts, leſt they

The father that ſhal liue godly and without fault before his children, and ſhal prouide that they may be vertuouſly and godly trayned vp and inſtructed, then if the ſonne will not obey the godly inſtruction and counſell of his Parentes, then hée ſhall not beare the iniquitie of his childe: But if the Parent ſhall not diligently & carefully performe his duetie, hée ſhal beare his childes offences, & the Lord wil require the blood of the childe at his hand: For not to teach and informe his childe in the wayes of God, is great wickedneſſe, neither can the holie Ghoſt dwell or haue any perfect working in yt man, where there is ſo great impietie, for true faith & inuocation of God muſt néedes be farre from ſuch a one, and the Lorde doeth deteſt and abhorre him.

For the good and vertuous childe though hée bée left poore, ſhall quickly and eaſily get and purchaſe vnto himſelfe aſwell friends, as alſo wealth and good fortune: whereas the riche, being rude, rechleſſe and wicked, ſhall ſoone ſcatter, waſte, and conſume his portion and patrimony, and after obtain the hatred and deteſtatiō of all men.

With the labour of the bodie the vnderſtanding is comforted, the deſire of carnall luſtes is reſtrained, pryde is vanquiſhed, vertue is retained, and whatſoeuer is corrupted through idleneſſe, is repaired, and reformed by labour.

And againe: Egestatem operata est manus remiſſa. A ſlow hand bringeth pouertie.

               You haue plainly taught vs by the moſt aſſured teſtimonies of the holy Scriptures, ihat our children are to be feared from this filthy vice of lying. But to the ende they might be the more feared from this great miſchiefe, if you wil ſhew vs ſome examples out of the heathen writers, you ſhall doe vs great pleaſure.

Wherefore Parents muſt teach and counſel their children that they abſtaine from chattering, babbling, backbiting of their neighbours, and all other vices and abuſes of the tongue, and from the companye and fellowſhip of wicked and flagitious men: as quaffers, flatterers, dicers, haunters of Harlots and ruffians.
                   For there is no creatures liuing more pernicious then flatterers, none that bringeth young men ſooner to deſtruction. Qui tandem patres & filios radicitus obliterant, Who at the laſt doe roote out, conſume, and vtterly bring into obliuion, both Fathers

                  and children, through the ſugred baite of their pretended pleaſure. For theſe are ſuch as incite and ſtirre vp their young maiſters to royſt it out liuely, and to cut it out of the whole cloth. The life of man is but a moment (ſay they). Therefore (my good young maiſter) ſpende not your time ſo baſely and obſcurely as many young Gentlemen doe, like momiſh meacockes and baſhful babes what néede you regard your Fathers threates and menaces? Hée doteth with age and is almoſt ready to bée laide on Béere, which ere it bée long wée ſhall hoyſe vp vpon our ſhoulders, and carry out at the dores to his funerall farewell. And afterwarde, ſo ſoone as euer they begin to burgen and ſproute vp a little, then doe they perſwade them, either to kéepe Harlots, or els moue them to marriage before they bée wiſe, or haue any experience of the worlde, & this muſt bée doone in all y• poſt haſt that may, that afterwards they may haue leaſure to repent them all the dayes of their life: And then for their maintenance, they muſt ſcrape & catche frō their parents, whatſoeuer they can get by booke or croke: ſo that at y• laſt they royſt it out ſo long, that they are driuen to this iſſue (for preſent payment of ready money whereof they euer ſtande in great néede) to make out leaſes of their landes, before they haue them in vſe and poſſeſſion, yea and oftentimes morgage, or ſell away before hand their poſſibilitie whiles their father is yet liuing to the great bewayling, lamentation and heauineſſe of the good olde man which pearceth ſo deepely, and is ſo ſurely ſetled in his ſorowfull hert, that full ſoone it haſteneth his hoare heade vnto the greedie graue, which is the thing that theſe young Royſters haue long wiſhed and deſired. Wherefore ſuch Parentes as haue anye

godly care of the good and vertuous education and trayning vp of their children, let them repell, amoue, and ſhake of from them all ſuch peſtelent flatterers, as moſt proude diſdamefull, & rauenous beaſtes.

               Of what ſpeciall points doth the true and perfect education of childrē conſiſt?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               The moſt perfect order of bringing vp children (as witneſſethA declaration of Saint Paules wordes. Educat liberos per eruditionem et correptionem.
                   Paul) doth depend vpon two things (that is to ſay) of godly inſtruction and moderate correction. And it apperteineth vnto erudition that Parents from their tender yéeres ſhewe and ſet before them, the Almightie power, goodneſſe, and clemencie of our moſte mercifull God, and put them often in remembrance of his innumerable benefites, which hée beſtoweth vpon them moſt bountifully, aſwell for the furniture of their bodies, as alſo for the adorning and garniſhing of their ſoules, and thus dayly more and more doth hée binde them vnto him through his bountifull liberalitie. For the giftes and benefites aſwell of the body as of the minde, are exceedingWhat, and how greate benefits children doe receaue from the
                        〈…〉
                      parents. great, as ſtrength, agilitie, and health of body, and what ſoeuer ſerueth both to the outward and inwarde garniſhing of the ſame. And this is not to bée thought one of the leaſt benefites, that it was his goodwill and pleaſure that wee ſhoulde bée borne, not of the Heathen Infidels, and of wicked & vngodly, but of godly, faithful, and chriſtian parents, which haue cauſed vs to be baptized, that ſo being waſhed and bathed in the Lauer of regeneration, by the precious blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and cleanſed from the filthineſſe of our ſinne (wherein wée were conceiued and borne) are nowe ingraffed and haue ſocietie in the fellowſhip and company of all the children of God, and faithfull ſeruants of Chriſte.
               And furthermore, this is greatly to be accounted of that through the great loue, care, and liberalitie of Parents they are inſtructed in y• true knowledge of god, ſo that now they repoſe al their whole truſt & confidence in the tender mercy of God. And doe féele and vnderſtand that for the excéeding tender loue of the Mediator & reconciler Ieſus Chriſt our ſinnes and offences are not onely pardoned vnto vs: but alſo we with him are made inheritors of the kingdom of heauen. Theſe, I ſay, & ſuch like things which doe apperteine to

the former part of this inſtruction; a good & godly father that is deſſrous to haue his children vertuouſly trained vp, ſhal not contemn and deſpiſe: but very diligently prouide that they may bée ſurely fixed and ingraffed into them whileſt they are yet young & tender.Vnhoneſt & vnlawefull things are to be ſhunned. It remaineth now y• we ſpeake ſomewhat of the other part, which teacheth that parents ought to reproue & correct their children for their offences, and that from their tender yéeres, they may learne to ſhun, deteſt, & abhore, al filthie, vnhoneſt, & vnlawfull thinges: and it ſhal profite very much, & be very auaileable to this purpoſe, if they declare and ſet before them, the wrath & anger of Almighty God, towards thoſe which commit ſuch thinges, and rehearſe and put them in remēbrance of the horrible paines & plagues with the which he hath afflicted and plagued them euen from the beginning of the worlde.

perſecutions of the Chriſtians, throughout all the corners of the worlde, as in Aſia, Aphrica, and Europe.

For, theſe rumors of warres, theſe motions of ſedition, theſe tumultes and vprores, theſe commotions, throughout al kingdomes and prouinces, theſe many ſtrange and gréeuous diſeaſes which dayly increaſe to our great annoyance, the dearth of corne and other victuals in many places, this excéeding pride without profite, this lacke of true friendſhip, good neighborhood, and vnfeigned loue, with many other moe miſchiefes as ill, let them perſwade their children, that they procéede of none other cauſe, then the heauie wrath of God, for our diſobedience and rebellion againſt the Lorde, and are as it were his whips & ſcourges, wherewith he doth ſmite, correct and chaſten vs, which otherwiſe would neuer turn vnto the Lord. To conclude, before all other thinges, parents ſhall prouide, that this bée ſurely ſetled, and firmely fixed in the tender mindes of children, that not only they may perceiue and iudge theſe temporal and bodily afflictions are laid vpon vs for our ſinnes & offences: But that they may ſurely perſwade themſelues that there are far greater and more gréeuous, prepared for vs (that is to ſay) moſte dreadful damnation and euerlaſting torment, except we ſpéedily repent and turne vnto the Lord.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Without all queſtion, theſe and ſuch like admonitions are not only profitable, but alſo very neceſſary. For there be many fathers of families, which are altogether ignorant that the worſhipping of Idols is ſo greate abhomination before God: And there are alſo very fewe that knowe what an heape of miſchiefes, luſte, lyinge, and drunkenneſſe bringeth with them. Therefore you haue doone maruellous well, that you haue put vs in remembrance of theſe thinges, and wee heartely beſeeche you, that for this godly care you haue towards vs, you woulde alſo teache

and inſtructe vs, by what meanes young men may beſt bee holden backe, reſtrained, feared and terrified from corrupt religion and falſe worſhipping of God, from diſobedience, rebellion and from all thoſe other vices.

               Theophilus.
               For aſmuch now as wee haue learned of you the abſolute order and perfect method of the inſtructing and ordering of our youth, ſo that what

ſoeuer perteineth to the ſame, you haue made it ſo apparant and manifeſt vnto vs, that (except wee were more ſluggiſh and dull than the drowſie Dormouſe, or more blinde than the mouſeling Molewarpe, whoſe pleaſure is to bee alwaies wrooting in the earth, and cannot indure the light) wee may eaſily ſee, perceiue, and vnderſtande, what eche of vs ought to folow, and what to ſhunne and auoide: with which your ſo excellent documentes and inſtructions (I ſay) when wee haue our children wel ſeaſoned and furniſhed, doe you thinke it meete and conuenient that wee manumit them, and ſet them at libertie to doe what they lyke beſt, and to ride or goe whither their fonde affections ſhal moue them?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Nay not ſo. For the nature of all men is ſo vitiate infected, and poyſoned with the ſinne of our firſt Parentes Adam and Eue, that except wée be continually reſtrained and holden backe with godly diſcipline, good counſell and admonitions, wée degenerat and growe euer worſe and worſe.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               But if the vtilitie and profite of children and youthes ſo require, thatWhither children ought to be ſent into ſtraunge countries to learne the liberall ſciences. they might trauel into farre countries, to haue ſome further ſight, skil, and iudgement in the liberal Artes, & to haue more knowledge in the tōgues, and experience in diuers other things: Shal they not rather alwayes abide and ſtaye at home, and be ſeuerely kept vnder the diſcipline of their Parents?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               I haue knowne ſome young Gentlemen which haue trauelled into ſtraunge nations, and at the laſt, haue returned home adorned and garniſhed with excellent learning. But yet in the meane time I haue knowne not a fewe, whiche haue returned home to their Parents, not only vnlearned, but alſo moſt vile varlets wicked vnthriftes, and royſting Ruffians, nouſeled in moſt wicked and vngodly opinions, blaſphemous, and ſtayned with moſt filthie and monſtruous manners, and beaſtly behauiour: which with much more profite might haue ſtayed at home with their Parents, as dayly examples doe clearely teſtifie. Notwithſtanding, if it may ſéeme profitable and neceſſarie to any, to ſende their ſonnes into Italy or Fraunce, to common ſtudies in their Vniuerſities, and to haue greater vnderſtanding and knowledge in the tongues and liberall Artes and Sciences. I will not gaine ſay it, or ſtriue

much with them, ſo that it be done with great aduiſement, counſel, and conſideration (that is to ſay) if Parents ſhal firſt diligently inſtruct their children in the true knowledge & reuerend fear of God, and that the ſame be ſurely ſetled, and moſt firmely fixed in their heartes, that it may not be eaſily remooued, and they caried away with euerie vaine blaſt of blaſphemous doctrine, and hatefull Hereſies, which ſhal ſoone be blowne aſwel into their outward eares, as alſo into their inward mindes, wherwith their hearts ſhalbe ſo infected, that both bodie & minde ſhal ſoone be out of all good courſe. Wherof all the Patriarkes and Prophets had great regard, as we may reade in their Bookes, which haue moſt diligently and carefully taught and inſtructed their children in the feare of God, foretolde them of perilles and daungers, and diſcouraged them from the company and fellowſhip of wicked men, as wée may ſée by the example of Beniamin, which was alwayes kepte at home ofGene. 42. his father Iacob. And except Ioſeph had béene diligently inſtructed of his father in the wayes of the Lorde God, Howe (I pray you) had hée auoyded the laſciuious wordes of Putiphers wyfe? which with her daily allurementes, and with her peruerſſe pollicies did ſollicite and moue him, that by ſome meanes ſhe might drawe him into the horrible ſinne of adulterie: except (I ſay) hée had béene carefully taught of his father, and that from his childehood, the true knowledge and feare of God, vndoubtedly hée had béene intrapped with her faire promiſes, and had vtterly periſhed with the ſugred woordes of this lewde laſciuious woman. For Ioſeph was young, well fauoured and comely. And if per aduenture there be any that will not be moued with theſe godly examples,De Natura Ceti. let him reade Plinie de natura Ceti, A Sea fiſhe of verie great bigneſſe, who deſcribeth his bodie to be 600. féete in length, and 300. féete in breadth, which watcheth and kéepeth his young ones very carefully, neither doth ſuffer them to ſtray far frō him, & is moued with ſuch excéeding care towards them, y• in the time of any ſtorme, hée receiueth them into his wombe againe, leaſt they ſhoulde be hurt with the force and violence of the ſtorme and tempeſt, or fall into any perill or daunger, and when the ſtorme is once ouer, and the Sea calme, hée eiecteth and vomiteth them out againe: By which example, I wiſh all Parentes to bée admoniſhed that they ſende not their children into ſtraunge and far countries

except, (as I ſaide) they be well and vertuouſly inſtructed: and ſo as well by reaſon of their age, as alſo by the experience of many thinges, they become wiſer, and of more perfect iudgement to diſcerne betwéene good and euill.
               Againe, if a man be ignoraunt, and knoweth howe and afterDe Delphinis natura. what maner this firſt mutable, wauering and ſlipperie age ought to be defended, preſerued and inſtructed, let him learne this leſſon alſo of the Delphins, which doe accompanie their young ones a long time, vntill they be well growne and able to ſhift, and pray for them ſelues: neither wil they ſuffer their young ones to raunge abroade and depart out of their ſight (except ſome elder one attend vpon them as a guide and ouerſeer. By this example alſo are Parentes to bée admoniſhed, that they ſende not their ſonnes into ſtraunge countries vnaduiſedly without their Paedagoges, Tutors & Gouernors, leaſt that they be Italianated, as that worthie man maiſter Aſchan hath ſufficiently deſcribed, in the latter end of his firſt Booke, intituled the Schoolemaiſter. Moreouer the Iewes alſo at this day, do obſerue this one thing verie carefully, that they ſuffer none of their ſonnes to forſake and leaue their fathers houſe, and ſo to trauell-into any ſtraunge nation or countrie, except they haue firſt liued in wedlocke, and haue had the fellowſhip and ſocietie of a wife by the ſpace of thrée yeares at the leaſt, and haue begot children by them: And then libertie is graunted vnto them to departe and goe whither they will about their néedfull affaires, and neceſſarie buſineſſe.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               The Iewes in this point, are farre wiſer than many of vs Chriſtians. But now ſeeing that by many arguments & good reaſōs you haue ſhewed and declared vnto vs, howe and after what maner Parentes ought to inſtruct and bring vp their children: nowe wee earneſtly deſire to knowe of you, after what ſorte the Mothers ought to deale with their children in their bringing vp. For it is certeine, that Mothers by the commaundeof God, ought to haue no leſſe care and charge belonging vnto them, than the Fathers and Maiſters, touching the good gouernment of their ſonnes▪ daughters, and ſeruantes.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               I cannot deny or refuſe this my duetie vnto you, deſiring ſo

good and godly a thing: Firſt, this duetie belongeth to godly matronesThe duetie of mothers. Ephe. 5. Col. 3. 1. Pet. 3. and mothers of families, that they them ſelues be in ſubiection to their owne huſbandes, as Saint Paule admoniſheth, ſaying: Mulieres ſubditae estote viris vestris, ſicut oportet in domino: Wiues ſubmit your ſelues, and be obedient to your owne husbandes, as vnto the Lorde:
                   Wherefore a good wife ought not to abuſe, the moderation, humanitie, and lenitie of her huſbande, for then ſhée reſiſteth the commaundement of God. For it is one thing to obey, an other thing, to rule, and an other thing to commaunde. And it nouriſheth loue and concorde exceedingly, when the wife is readie at the becke and commaundement of her huſbande: enclineth and prepareth her ſelfe to accompliſh his requeſts, and ſtudieth to pleaſure and gratifie him to the vttermoſt of her power: And eſchueth all thinges which ſhée knoweth woulde offende him. For thus verely (as one ſaieth) a good wife by obeying her huſbande, doeth alſo after a ſort, rule and commaund him. And this ought a woman to doe, not only for the auoiding of variance, diſcorde, & breach of loue, but rather for that it is the commaundement of God.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               What are the chiefeſt ornaments of Godly Matrones?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Saint Peter ſaieth: that the moſt excellent ornament of godlyPet. 3. Matrones is, to ſtay and repoſe their whole truſt, confidence and hope in the liuing God: That they ſhould be ſober in their outward apparell, & be decked inwardly with the vertues of their mindes, as with gentleneſſe, méekeneſſe, quietneſſe, and chaſtitie, which are moſt precious thinges in the ſight of God.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               But nowe ſeeing wee know that Matrimonie is inſtituted and ordeined of God, for the procreation of children, what (I pray) woulde you aduiſe and counſel the mother to doe, when ſhee ſhal perceiue and feele her ſelfe with childe?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               So ſoone as the mother ſhall perceiue or knowe her ſelfe to be with childe, ſhée ſhall commit the ſame ſo conceiued in her wombe, vnto the Lorde God with feruent and heartie prayers, and ſhall haue great care during that time, that ſhée doe not vere, diſquiet, and giue her ſelfe to anger. Alſo ſhée ſhall forbeare all dauncing,

and immoderate ſtirring, ſtriuing, lifting and labour, from intemperauncie in eating and drinking, and from all other thinges which might be offenciue or hurtfull to the childe whileſt it is yet in the mothers wombe: And when through the prouidence of God ſhée ſhall perceiue and féele the time of her trauayle to be at hand, ſhée ſhal wholly giue her ſelfe to earneſt and godly prayers, and after that the infant is borne, then according to the order preſcribed by the worde of God, ſhall prepare to haue it baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Now when the infant is borne, is it not the mothers parte and duetie to nouriſh it with hir owne breſtes and milke?

               In mine opinion, it is moſt neceſſarie and beſt agréeing to theMothers oght to nouriſh their children with their owne dugges. nature of the childe, that mothers nouriſh and giue ſucke to their owne children; with their owne dugges and breaſtes: for mothers with a greater care and diligence will cheriſh them, and are moued therunto with a certain intire loue, & naturall affection, for y• they are of them bread & born. And therfore they haue often this prouerb in their mouthes: It is a neare collop, that is cut from their owne fleſh: So that the mothers loue is vnfained But theſe Nurſes vſe no true, but fained & diſſembled loue, becauſe they are hirelings and ſo by y• meanes: vrged to practiſe & vſe their kindneſſe, for gaine and lucer ſake. And Aulus Gellius ſaith: Optima mater non permittat aliouius
                  Aulus Gol. 
                  lactis contagione filiū ſuum infici. A good mother cannot abide nor ſuffer her childe to bee infected with the contagion of a ſtraungers milke.
                   And nature her ſelfe doeth euidently declare and ſhewe, that mothers ought to cheriſh with their owne milke thoſe, whiche they haue ingendred and borne. And therefore nature hath giuen to euerie liuing beaſt that bringes foorth young, power to nouriſhe and comforte the ſame, with their owne milke. And God by his great prouidence and inſcrutable wiſedome, hath prouided and giuen vnto women two breaſtes, that if it ſhoulde fortune at one trauayle, they ſhoulde be deliuered of two children, that then they might haue two fountaynes for their better nouriſhing. Great rare therefore muſt bée imployed, and paynes beſtowed, that the verie mothers them ſelues (as I haue ſayde) doe nouriſhe and bring vp their infantes with their owne breaſtes and mylke.
               
                  For the benefite of the mothers milke, hath wrought ſuche great effect, rewarde and merite with our elders, that whenſoeuer the mothers haue deſired any harde or difficult thing at the handes of their children, they haue euer deſired and requeſted the ſame after this maner, that (for the tender loue they beare vnto them in their infancie, when they nouriſhed and ſuckled them euen with the milke of their owne breaſtes, with great care and diligence, mixed ſometime with ſorrowe, and the oft abridging of their wonted pleaſures, with the abandoning of many ſwéete ſléepes) they wold graunt their requeſtes. As Homer maketh report of Hecuba, the wife of Priamus King of Troy, Quae nudatis vberibus (quae ſuxerat aliquando Hector) orabat vt ſe intra maenia contineret, Which with her bare and naked breaſtes (which Hector her ſonne, that moſt noble, valiaunt, and worthie wight, had ſometime ſucked, and with their ſweete ſugred and dulcete droppes, had batled and nouriſhed him vp, when as yet hee was any maner way farre vnable to helpe and ſuccour him ſelfe; For the requiting whereof, and as euer hée woulde ſhewe him ſelfe a louing, naturall, and obedient childe towardes her) ſhée (I ſay) deſired and intreated him, that hée woulde now ſaue, protect, and defend her within the reared rampires, and warlike wals of Troy; that moſt famous and renoumed Citie, from the furious force of the raging and cruell enemies, which hée moſt obediently (aſwell with valiant courage, as alſo with prudent pollicitie) perfourmed, vntill hée him ſelfe was ſlaine by Achilles, one of the moſt valiaunt Capitaines of the Gréekes.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               You haue ſhewed great reaſons why the mothers ſhould giue ſuck to their owne children, But if they be oppreſſed with infirmities and diſeaſes, and be vnhealthfull, (which may happen) or haſten to the procreation of other children. Shal they not then procure Nurſes for the better nouriſhing and bringing vp of their infantes?

And ſo with ſucking the milk and nutriment of ſuch lewde Nurſes, iſſuing & procéeding from an vnnaturall bodie & diſordred minde, be infected with the moſt pernicious contagion, of ſoule filthineſſe, odious errours, & deteſtable diſeaſes, which ſhal verie hardly or neuer be remoued & cured. For euen as it is moſt neceſſarie & expedient to frame and faſhion the limmes & members of children (ſo ſoone as they be borne) that they may grow ſtraight & ſéemely: So in like maner, it is cōuenient and moſt decent to indue their childrē with good maners (euen frō their Cradles) and to frame them vp in ciuil behauiour, whileſt they are yet young & tender: For infancie is a flexible thing, and fit to frame to what thing you pleaſe, (as we haue ſaid before.) And as Seales be ſooneſt inſculped and engrauen into ſoft waxe, ſo are good diſciplines, precepts and eruditions, with great facilitie inſtilled & printed in childrens tender mindes. And Plato ſéemeth verie diligently to admoniſh Nurſes, that they ſing not to their babes and youg infantes euerie trifling tale, ruſticke ryme, baudie Ballet, and olde wiues fabled fanfies, leſt from their Cradles it ſhall fortune, that they be nouſeled in folly, and fraught with corrupt conditions, and too bolde behauiour.

Firſt, they ought to teach them, the true knowledge & worſhip of the Almightie, immortall and euer liuing God, the creator & maker of all things: the duetie they owe to their countrie: the reuerend loue y• they ſhould beare towards their Parents and kinſfolks: that from their tender yeres, they might receiue and taſt that, which is the verie groundworke & ſure foundation of all other vertues, and without the which nothing can proſper. Let them haue felowſhip and acquaintance with thoſe, which in them ſelues ſhal ſhewe ſome hope of towardneſſe ſuch as ſhal feare God, and obey the lawes: honour their Parents, and reuerence their elders: which with their equals ſhall be curteous and gentle, and to their inferidurs, fauourable and friendly: Let them admit and receiue all with chearefull wordes and countenance, as companions without any diſdaine, but yet let them vſe the beſt moſt familiarly.

In like maner teach them to obſerue and kéepe a temperancie and moderation in meates and drinkes, that (as it were) the foundation of continencie might bée laide, and framed vnto a future fortune and age yet to come.
               Furthermore, let them admoniſhe and warne them to flée and ſhunne thoſe delightes and pleaſures, which are inwrapped with any kinde of ſhame and diſhoneſtie: And let them beſtow their ſtudie, diligence, and knowledge in thoſe thinges, which may bée to their praiſe, profite, and pleaſure, when they ſhal attaine to a greater age, & grauer exerciſes in y• cōmon wealth.

Beſides this, looke, what is a ſhame for them to doe in ſecrete, ſuffer them not to talke and ieſt thereof openly.From what vices children ought to be feared. Therefore reſtraine and kéepe them from al filthie, contumelious, and rebalde wordes, and if it happen that any diſſolute, diſhoneſt, and vnſéemely ſpéeche doe eſcape them at any time: they may not laugh at the ſame, and hide it with a kiſſe, as many fonde mothers doe: but rather reprooue them, and giue them ſuch moderate correction for the ſame, as may bée for their amendment.

               I doe eaſily beléeue it, Saint Chryſoſtome was wont to exhort

Mothers take vpon you the charge of your daughters, it is an eaſie care and labour for you: looke to them carefully, that they may bee kept within the doores, and holden in ſome honeſt labour and exerciſe, let them learne ſuche qualities as may bee moſt ſeeming and beſt agreeing to their ſtate and calling. And ſuffer them not to runne gadding and gambolding, from Alehouſe to alehouſe, or from Tauerne to Tauerne in any lewde or light company.
                   And before all thinges bring them vp in the feare of God, and true religion, teach them to bée contemners of this outward decking, trimming, and niceneſſe: and haters of idleneſſe, the very fountaine of follies, and mother of all other miſchiefes: And in ſtéede of this outwarde beautie and gariſhe gaudineſſe, garniſhe them with the inwarde vertues and beautie of the minde, as wiſedome, ſhame faſtneſſe, modeſtie, ſoberneſſe, ſilence, and chaſtitie, which things ſhall ſooner preferre them vnto a wiſe man in the way of marriage, then any other dowrie.

               My good Theodidactus, here would I be glad to heare of you ſome examples of godly matrones, by the which mothers might be more diligently admoniſhed, that they ſlacke not their duetie at any time, but that they may the more diligently care for their children and families by their good examples.
            
            
               
               Theodidactus.
               There bée many examples of Godly matrones, by the which mothers may not only bée exhorted, but alſo excited and ſtirred vp to the better perfourmance of their dueties, For what mother wil bée ſo hard hearted, vnnaturall, and vncourteous, that will not bée moued with this one, and that ſo godly an example of Monica theDe Monica matre Aug. exemplum. mother of Auguſtine, which, with what painefull labours, what excéeding cares, what great diligence, and watchfulneſſe, what ardent prayers, and almoſt coutinuall teares did ſhée draw forward Auguſtine her ſonne vnto the true religion & faith in Ieſus Chriſte, who ſhall not eaſily perceiue and ſée ex liberis confeſsionum? For hée writeth of himſelfe in his 3. booke, after this maner. Et miſiſti manum tuam ex alto, & de profunda caligne eruiſti animam meam, quum ploraret ad te mater mea, fidelis tua, amplius quàm flent matres corporea funera &c. And thou O Lord diddeſt ſend downe thine hand from heauen, and diddeſt deliuer my ſoule from vtter darkneſſe, when my mother thy faithfull ſeruant, wept and lamented vnto thee, more then mothers commonly vſe to weepe, lament and mourne for the corporal funerals of their dearely beloued children.
                   The examples alſo of the Heathen doe ſometime mooue our mindes vnto vertue, wherefore it ſhall not bée amiſſe for good Matrones and mothers of families to followe the example of Euridices, who though ſhée were an Illyrian,

Without doubt this ſo godly an example of Abrahā ought to admoniſh & earneſtly moue vs which haue either ſōnes or daughters ready to marry: to haue great care of them: For except Abraham had feared ſome greate perill and daunger, and had knowen ſome great & ſecrete miſchief to be hid and lurking therin, certainly he woulde neuer haue giuen ſo earneſt charge to his ſeruaunt. That he ſhould not take a wife of the daughters of the Chanaanites. For it was not to be doubted, but that ſome of their daughters were of good towardnes, nature & inclination, & alſo tractable,

which happily might haue béen drawne vnto Abrahams religion, but hée would not haue his ſonne to aduenture and make triall of ſo great a danger, and in ſo weightie a matter.

Who ſo honoureth his father, his ſinnes ſhalbe forgiuen him, and hée that honoureth his mother, is like one that gathereth treaſure together. Who ſo honoureth his father, ſhall haue ioy of his owne children, and when hée maketh his prayer, hée ſhalbe heard: he that honoureth his father ſhal haue long life. Honour thy father in déed, in word, & in all patience, that thou maiſt haue Gods bleſſing, & his bleſſing ſhal abide with thée at ye laſt. The bleſſing of ye father buildeth vp the houſes of y• childrē: but the mothers curſe rooteth out the foundations.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Of the honour and obedience of children towards their Parents, you haue ſhewed vnto me ſentences worthy to bee written in golden letters: wherfore I pray you go forward, if you haue any other things to cōmunicate vnto vs. For what can be more pleaſant & wholſome vnto our eares, and to the hearing of theſe children, than the holie word of God?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Becauſe I perceiue theſe holy ſcriptures and places are ſo well liking vnto your eares, I will procéede with the reſt in order. Solomon alſo promiſeth great honours, vnto obedient children, ſaying after this maner: O my ſonne heare the inſtructions of thy father,Prou. 1.
                  
& forſake not the law of thy mother: For that ſhal bring graceIdem. 4. vnto thine head, & ſhalbe as a chaine about thy necke. And againe, Heare ye children the fatherly exhortation, and take good héed that ye may learne wiſdom. Hearken vnto counſell, and receiue correctiō, that thou maiſt be wiſe at the laſt. My ſonne incline thine eare,Idem. 19. and hearken vnto the wordes of the wiſe.
               And in the booke of Wiſedome it is written: Who ſo deſpiſethSapien. 3. wiſedome and inſtruction, is vnhappie. Saint. Paul that elect veſſell, would not with ſilence paſſe ouer this place, but wold alſo admoniſh all children, and would ſhew them the wayes of obedience, when in the 6. to the Ephe. hée commaundeth children thus, Filij obedite parentibus vestris in domino, hoc enim iustū est. Children obey your Parentes in the Lord, for this is meete and conuenient.
                   Honour thy father and mother, which is the firſt commaundement in the promiſe, that thou maiſt proſper, and liue long, &c. And againe vnto the Coll. Children obey your parents in all things, for that is pleaſingColloſ. 3. vnto the Lord.
               Saint Peter alſo is not vnmindfull of this place, ſaying thus:1. Petr. 5. 
                  Adoleſcentes ſubditi estote ſenioribus. Young men, be yee in ſubiection vnto your elders.
                   Godly children (which haue any care of their ſaluatiō) ought alwayes to haue theſe holy precepts fixed before their eyes, for they are full of wonderfull promiſes, they promiſe vnto children long life, honour, wiſdō, & diuers other kinds of bleſſings.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               By this your godly communication (my good Theodidactus) it nowe ſufficiently appeareth vnto vs, that vnto godly and obedient children all happineſſe whatſoeuer is to be expected: but now would I gladly knowe, what maner plagues and puniſhments, rebellious, obſtinate, and wicked children are conſtrained to feare, and ſuſtaine?As bleſſinges are offered of God euerie where vnto obedient children, ſo vnto the wicked and rebellious plagues and curſes are alwayes imminent. Prou. 20.
               
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               The holy ſcriptures euerie where doe ſpeake of the malidictiōs, threatnings and miſeries of wicked and rebellious children, and a thouſand kindes of euils, as we read in Moſes. Deut 27. Accurſed is he which doeth not honour his father and mother. And in Leuit. 27. hée ſaith, Curſed is hée which doeth not honour his father and mother, and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen. And Solomon ſaith: who ſo curſeth father or mother, his light ſhall be put out in obſcure darkneſſe.
            
            
               
               Theophilus.
               With theſe ſo horrible threatninges of God, wicked and diſobedient children, are to be reſtrained from their peruerſe kinde of life, vnto the obeying of their Parents: For as there is nothing more true, than thoſe promiſes made vnto godly and obedient children: So is there nothing more certaine, than thoſe curſes and threatninges which God hath threatned to light vpon the wicked and rebellious children at the laſt, except they bee moued with ſorowfull and heartie repentaunce, and that ſpeedely.
            
            
               Amuſus.
               Yeſterday you promiſed to declare and ſhew vnto vs, after what maner Parentes are to bee honoured of their children, and what great obedience is to be required of them, and that not out of the ſcriptures only, but alſo you ſaid, you would make the ſame manifeſt by the teſtimonies of the auncient fathers and Philoſophers: wherof I pray you diſcharge your ſelfe firſt of thoſe your promiſes.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               My good friend Amuſus, I will with all my heart recite vnto you, and to your children, thoſe ſentences which I collected of late as well out of the monuments of the auncient fathers, as alſo out of the decrées of the Philoſophers. For Cyrill ſaith: Christianorum
                  Cyrillus. 
                  prima landabilis piet as eſt, vt eos qui nos procrearunt, honore afficiamus, & labores eorum remuneremus, & omnibus viribus conemur illis otium dare & quietem. Et ſi enim plurima illis reddiderimus, at certè viciſſim illis procreationem reddere nunquàm poſſumus. The chiefeſt godlines of Chriſtians worthie to be commended is this, that we honour them which haue procreated & begot vs, and that we requite their paines beſtowed vpon vs, & indeuour our ſelues to the vttermoſt of our power, to procure their eaſe and quietneſſe. For albeit wee ſhal be able to requite many thinges which they haue beſtowed vpon vs, yet certainly are wee neuer able to requite againe vnto them our procreation.
                   Saint Chryſoſtome
                  Chryſoſt. ſaieth: Tanquam ſeruus Parentibus tuis inſeruito: quid enim tantum illis reddas, quantum ab illis accepisti? non enim licet illos procreare. Euen as a ſeruant obey thy Parents, for what thing ſo great canſt thou reſtore vnto them, as thou haſt receiued from them? for thou canſt by no meanes beget them again. Liberigrati, ait Baſilius, magnas efficiūt
                  Baſilius. 
                  parentum landationes. Thankful and obedient children, (ſaieth Baſil) doe procure and accompliſh the great praiſes of Parentes.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Qualem parentibus retuleris gratiam, talem in ſenectute à liberis expectato. Such duetie and reuerence as thou ſheweſt to thy parents, looke for the like from thy children when thou art olde.
                   I will alſo héerevnto adde the ſaying of Euripides. Nihil eſt quod magis decorum &
                  
                  Euripides. 
                  honeſtum ſit liberis, quàm ſi è patre bono nati ſint, & genitoribus dignam referant gratiam. There is nothing, more comely and honeſt vnto children, than if they bee borne of good parents, and that they giue worthie thankes vnto their begettors.
                  
               
            
            
               Theophilus.
               You haue recited vnto vs many and notable ſentences, concerning the honour and obedience of children towardes their Parents. but before you recite any more, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to ſhew and declare vnto Amuſus & his children more plainely the ſignification of this word (honor) which is due vnto parents.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               This worde honor, doeth ſignifie a true reuerence and lowlyneſſeThe definition of this worde honor. of hearte, for this outward ſhewe in vailing of the Bonnet, and bowing of the knée or body, is nothing worth, except there bée ioyned there withall the inward reuerence of the minde, wherein godly children doe teſtifie, that they eſtéeme nothing more precious and deare vnto them then the loue and honour of theyr Parentes.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Our vnlearned youth haue alwaies ſuppoſed and thought, that true honour hath conſiſted in the putting of their Cappe, and making of curteſie, and that there is none other thing due vnto Parents: Wherefore wee woulde bee right glad to heare further of you, what it is to honor Parents.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               To honor Parents, is to déeme and iudge honorably of them,What it is to honour &c. for that God hath made vs ſubiect vnto them, for by the determinate will and appointment of God, they are to gouerne, and we to obey. And therefore with all our heartes, wee muſt ſubmit our ſelues vnto their wiſedome, iuſtice, iudgement and authoritie. And albeit they ſhall ſometime offend and erre in performing their duties (as it is the nature of all men) yet muſt wée pardon, excuſe, and couer their faultes moſt louingly and reuerently. For wheras Saint Paule ſaith: Honor thy father and mother &c. Hée requireth

this one thing of children, that with all their heartes, they loue, reuerence, & ayde their parents to the vttermoſt of their power, and alſo thoſe to whom their Parents haue committed them, that is to ſay, Magiſtrates, Elders, Preachers, Maiſters, Teachers, Tutors and ſuch like. Therefore to honor Parents is not onely to ſalute them humbly, to ſpeake to them louingly, and to vſe them courteouſly, to put of the cappe before them, to giue them the way and vpper hand in euery place: But alſo the holy Scriptures doeEphe. 6. Coll. 3. Heb. 12. 7. 9. Prou. 1. 4. 6. 8. 15. 17. & 29. teach children to obey their parents, to ſerue them, to feare, loue, honor, and reuerence them, not only in wordes and outwarde ſhewe, but in their heartes and mindes alſo: To follow their godly precepts and examples of life: and paciently to take correctiō at their hands: To make continuall and heartie prayers vnto God for thē, and to relieue and nouriſh their Parentes in caſe they fall into pouertie and decay. And whē they are olde, to guide, lead, yea & beare them on their ſhoulders if néede require and in all pointes by ſhewing themſelues obedient and good children, to moue their Parents to bée louing and good vnto them.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Theſe without doubt are no light and eaſie thinges which the holy Ghoſt doeth require of all children. But wherein doeth the chiefeſt honor of parents conſiſt?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               True honour conſiſteth in this, that wée thinke and iudge worthilyIn what thinge the true honor of pa. doth conſiſte. of our parents, that wée regarde them moſt honorably, that wée yéelde and giue al reuerence vnto their authoritie and iudgement: that wée neuer contemne or deſpiſe them, bée they neuer ſo poore, olde, and croked, yea, if they did ſéeme to dote, and were very wayward, to preferre the title and name of Father and mother, before all faults whatſoeuer. Neither to regard or eſtéeme what maner of parents, but to reioyce & bée glad that we haue parents. For although thou ſhalt bée promoted to great worſhip and honor, yet oughteſt thou to bée thankful to thy poore and baſe father, to whom next vnto God thou art moſt bounde for the ſame.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               As farre as I gather by your wordes, it is no ſimple honour that is due 
                     •
                  nto parents.
            
            
               
               Theodidactus,
               Nay rather there is double honour due to our Parents and Elders, that is to ſay, both an outwarde and inwarde honour: The outwarde which conſiſteth in Ceremonies, and outwarde behauiour, which wée attribute vnto them, with our louing wordes, gentleneſſe, and ſeruiſableneſſe: but the inward honour, wherby wée loue and imbrace them with all our heartes and mindes, and the law of God doth require both theſe of children.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Who bee called our parents in the fift commandement?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               All are vnderſtoode by the name of Parents, vnder whoſe gogernment wée liue, ſuch are chiefly our naturall parents, then our Magiſtrates, Paſtors, Teachers, Tutors, Maiſters and Miſtreſſes, and ſuch like,
            
            
               Theophilus.
               What is contrary to the honour of Parents?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               To contemne them, to reſiſt their iudgemente and authorities, to offende them, not to obey their commaundements though they bee lawfull and honeſt, and to leaue and forſake them in their néed and neceſſitie,
            
            
               Theophilus.
               What kinde of men woulde God haue honoured before others?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               God woulde haue no kinde of men to bée more honoured thenWhat men are to bee honored before other. our Parents, and therefore hée hath placed that Commaundement before the reſt of the ſecond table: for there is none that hath doone, or can doe ſo much for vs as our Parents, none that can indure and ſuſtain ſo great griefes, ſorrowes, and cares as they, and often doe ſhedde their teares, with moſt gréeuous ſobbes and ſighings for our ſakes, wherefore of very right wée ought to loue and honour them.
            
            
               Theophilus
               What fruite and profite commeth vnto the children, by the obeying and honouring of their parents.
            
            
               
               Theodidactus
               Very great fruite and profite ſurely, for Euripides ſaith: Quiſquis in vita paréntes colit, hic vinus & defunctus dus charus eſt. Whoſoeuer reueréceth and obeieth his parents in this life, he is beloued of the Lord in this life, and ſhall bee in the life to come.
                   And in another place hée ſaith: Qui cupis eſſe ſenex, charos venerare parentes: Quae patri facies, filius illa tibi.
               
               
                  Who ſo deſires olde age to ſee, muſt honor parents fame:
                  For what thou doeſt to Parents thine, thy childe ſhall doe the ſame.
               
            
            
               Theophilus.
               As the honor which is due vnto Parents is manifold, ſo I iudge parēts are to be honored after diuers maners.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               You ſay very truely, for Parents are to bée honored after thrée ſortes chiefly, Firſt children ſhall truely loue their parentes with all their heartes and minde they ſhall giue vnto them all high dignitie and reuerence: they ſhall ſo eſtéeme of them, as that no treaſure in the world ought to bée more deare and precious vnto them. Secondly they ſhall honour them with wordes and good maners, ſhewing vnto them all kinde of reuerence that may bée, they may not curſe them, nor chat or mutter againſt them, but rather ſuffer them paciently, albeit they bée more waieward, hard, & egar, than either reaſon or wiſdom doth require. Thirdly, they muſt alſo honor them with their labor, paines & trauel (that is to ſay) they ſhal helpe, relieue and prouide for them, both with their bodies & goods: and in no wiſe ſuffer thē to be oppreſſed with pouertie and miſerie when they growe aged. And children ſhall doe this, not onely willingly, but alſo reuerently, and with great lowlineſſe of minde, as though this duetie and benefite, ſhoulde bée doone to God him ſelfe (as it is in very déed) & they ought to be moſt thankful vnto God which hath thus preferred them to this worſhip and honour, and hath made them able thus to perfourme this duetie.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               As the honor which is due vnto parents conſiſteth in many parts: So I iudge that there be many cauſes why children ought to honor and reuerence their parents, and elders.
            
            
               
               Theodidactus.
               There bée fiue principall cauſes, why children ought to honourThere bee fiue cauſes of honor &c. their parents.
               Firſt, they are to bée honoured and reuerenced, for that God by them hath giuen vs both body and ſoule.
               Secondly, after wée are nowe borne, God by our Parents doth nouriſh vs, prouide all things neceſſary for vs, & bring vs vp more tenderly then the Hen doth her chickins.
               Thirdly, they care and prouide that wée may bée baptized, and ingraffed into Chriſte, and ſo made the children of God, and heires of his celeſtiall kingdome.
               Fourthly, when now wée are growne vp, & that it is time, that wée ſhoulde know, learne, and vnderſtand the worde of God, then the Almightie God by our parents, doth deliuer vnto vs that moſt pure & excellent doctrine (that is to ſay) the ten Commandements, the Simbole or Créede of the Apoſtles, and the Lordes prayer. And beſides this, our Parents doe teache and inſtruct vs in good maners, and ſuch lowly & gentle behauiour: to the end wée might become ſuch, as with whom all honeſt and godly men would gladly haue their conuerſation.
               Laſtly, they doteach, or cauſe vs to be taught, ſom handiecraft, Science, Trade or Occupation, wherwith wée may honeſtly get our liuings, in that ſtate & condition of life, vnto the which it ſhall pleaſe God to appoint vs: by them wée haue our Countrie, then the which nothing is more ſwéete or deare vnto vs: by them wee inioy the benefite of the lawes of our Towne, Citie, & Common Wealth, then the which nothing is more to bée obeyed: by them wée receiue and inioy our Patrimony and inheritance, then the which nothing is more to bée wiſhed: Finally, what is it that wée doe not receiue by their meanes? So great paines and labour haue they in bringing vp their children, in framing, forming, teaching, nurturing and adorning them, that they are not able fully to perfourme their dueties, woulde they neuer ſo faine: And theſe be the chiefeſt cauſes, why God doth commaund vs to honour our Parents. Therefore vndoubtedly they are very wicked children, which do not this (aſmuch as they poſſible may) ſéeing they receiue ſo great an heape of benefites from their Parents.
            
            
               
               Theophilus.
               My good Theodidactus, hitherto you haue inſtructed vs, that parents are not ſlightly to bee honored: but alſo you haue added heereunto, that they are reuerently to bee honored, with great ſubmiſſion and lowlines of minde, and to whom children ought to bee obedient, not as to men, but as to God himſelfe. Theſe things are not as yet ſufficiently vnderſtanded of theſe children, wherefore you had neede to explane and make manifeſt the ſame vnto vs more plainely.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Although this ſentence hath no ſcruple or doubt, yet with all my hearte wil I gratifie theſe young ones concerning this thing: there is a like ſaying of S. Paul touching ſeruants, to whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh after this maner: Seruants obey your bodily maiſters, with feare & trembling, in y• ſimplenes of your hearts, as to ChriſtEpheſ. 6. Coll. 3. himſelfe, not with the eye ſeruice as pleaſing men, but as ſeruing the Lorde Chriſt. And if ſeruants ought to obey their maiſters, as the Lord God himſelf: ought not children much more to reuerence and obey their parents? But to the ende that theſe thinges may be the better vnderſtood, I will vſe a ſimilitude for the better capacity of children. Euen as the chiefe maiſter cōmitteth his ſchollers vnto his vſſher, to teach, guide, and gouerne them in his abſence, to whom they owe the like reuerence for the time as to their maiſter And as the vſſher doth ſharply puniſh and correct their diſobediēceParentes are Gods vicars in earth. if they offend, ſo doth y• Lord God gréeuouſly puniſh thoſe children which do not obey their Parents: For he hath appointed parents to be his vſſhers in his ſtéede for the training vp and inſtructing of children. Now God is the chiefeſt workmaiſter & vſſher, & the parents are but meanes and inſtruments, by the which god worketh theſe things. Therfore parents are to be honored, loued, & obeyed, becauſe God will haue it ſo, who puniſheth rebels, not as contemners of men, but as railers of his will & high maieſtie, wherfore I woulde haue good children héereby admoniſhed, leaſt that they ſufer themſelues to be drawne of the Diuel into the ſinne of diſobedience and rebellion.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               You giue vs very wiſe and godly counſell, but wee knowe that there is ſo greate malice ingendered in the mindes of children, that they fall

very often into this ſinne of rebellion. What remedie therefore doe you thinke meete to be applied to this vnhappineſſe and crookedneſſe of nature ſo vitiate and defiled.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               I iudge no remedy to bée more effectuall for this purpoſe, then if they ſet before their eyes the feare of plagues & puniſhmentes, and that by this meanes they may bée brideled; and reſtrayned frō
                  Diſobedient children are accurſed of God. theſe raſhe aſſaultes and giddie attemptes and that they accuſtome themſelues to loue and cheriſh diſcipline, that they may be obediēt to their parents, and to all pollitike gouernment. And let them aſſure themſelues that God will puniſh their pride, their malapertneſſe, and contempt of diſcipline, as we ſée in Caine, which is accurſed. In the ſonnes of Samuel, and Heli, Abſolon and Siba which moued ſedition againſt Dauid, and therefore were deſtroyed. It ſhould bée very profitable vnto young men, if they woulde conſider theſe horrible examples in hiſtories. For it is certayne in the whole lawe there are added promiſes of rewards, which are beſtowed vpon the obedient, as is to be ſéene in Tobia which was bleſſed of his father, in Ieſu the ſonne of Mary which was ſubiect to his Parentes, and obeyed them euen to the death. And in Iohn and others innumerable of godly children. And there are alſo added vnto the law threatnings of plagues and puniſhmentes, which the ſtubborne, wicked and diſobedient children ſhal féele, that haue contemptuouſly diſobeyed their Parents. For it is written: Al colluſion, diſobedience and rebellion, receiueth iuſt recompence of ſuch hurte and dammage, which thing at this day, manie young men haue aſſayed and prooued to their greate ſhame and confuſion: which haue contemned the obedience of Parents. Euen as it happened vnto Eſau, which vered his Parentes in marrying vngodly wiues, which intreated their Father and mother in lawe very contumeliouſly deſpitefully and contemptuouſly: And he himſelfe alſo taketh vpon him in his fathers houſe to commaund moſt malapertly and proudly, and expulſed his brother Iacob, for whom he lay in waite to haue murdered and ſlayne: neyther doth he feare puniſhment nor regardeth the threatnings of God, but contemneth his fathers admonitions, and therefore he is accurſed.
               But on the contrary part Iacob both reuerenceth his parents,Iacob.
                  
and loueth his brother: for he feareth the iudgement of God, & puniſhment that might therof enſue. And agayne alſo he knew & cōſidered y• rewards which were promiſed for well doyng, therfore he doeth his duetie, that hee might call vpon God with a good conſcience. Furthermore alſo he acknowledgeth that God hath care and regarde vnto corporall bleſſinges, and therefore prayeth vnto GOD and deſireth that he might bée defended and ayded againſt his brother, after this manner doth he exerciſe his faith and inuocation, whiles hée ſtudieth by all meanes poſſible to comfort and appeaſe the ſorrowes and griefes of his Parentes, & at the laſt giueth place to his brother: Therfore he enioyeth great rewardes at Gods hand, he is inſtructed and defended in a woonderfull manner, preſerued & enriched amongſt his very enimies, that being olde, he ſaw his ſonnne Ioſeph in flooriſhing & moſt proſperous ſtate, which to him was no little ioy and comfort. Let children weigh and conſider theſe and ſuch like examples, and let them learne vndoubtedly y• God hath great care of them, & that he will beſtow vpon them many corporall bleſſinges for performing their dueties towardes their Parents, Magiſtrates, Maiſters, & Teachers: Let them alſo conſider and call to their remembraunce what greate paynes and cares Parentes haue had in their education, and what true loue they beare towardes them, and what greate benefites ſhall redounde vnto them by their godlie education and inſtruction. For theſe and ſuch like bleſſinges, let them acknowledge themſelues to bée thankfull. And let them knowe that GOD doeth puniſhe the vnthankefull as ſayeth Solomon: Non recedet malum à domo ingrati. Plagues and puniſhmentes ſhall not departe from the houſe of an vnthankfull perſon.
                   Alſo let all godly ChildrenIoſeph. and young men ſtudie to followe the Patriarche Ioſeph, and by his example learne to honour their Parentes: Who when hee was ſolde into Egypt, and afterwarde by Gods prouidence promoted to great honour, and high authoritie, ſo that hee was the very next vnto the king, how did hee prouide for his father Iacob, 
                     •
                  ding for him very honorably to come to him into Egypt, where he had great entertainment of the king and enioyed the pleaſures and bleſſings of the lande, afterwards when hée was dead, with what great pompe & renome did he carrie him foorth thence into the land of Chanaan, there to bée buried with the Fathers the Patriarkes:

               But to contemne them, is ſurely a moſt peſtilent thing, and extreame madneſſe. For ſeeing that our life is verie ſhort, the wiſedome and experience of thinges is to bee learned of our auncientes and elders. For the authoritie of elders is an holy thing, and to bée had in great reuerence, wherefore it is written: Coram cano capite
                  Leuit. 19. 
                  conſurge, honora perſonam ſenis, & time Dominum Deum tuū. Thou ſhalt riſe vp before the hoarehead, & reuerence the perſon of an old man, and dread thy Lord God:
                   That is to ſay, the Lord is to be feared and reuerenced in the elders. For it is a young mans part in whō there is any ſigne of good towardneſſe, to eſtéeme y• counſell of his elders and to follow it. For hée that learneth of young men, to whō is hée likened I pray you? Nempe ei qui edit vuas immaturas, & bibit vinum de torculari ſuo. Verely vnto him that eateth vnripe & ſowre grapes, and drinketh wine out of his winepreſſe:
                   But who ſo learneth of his elders, Similis ei qui edit vuas maturas, & bibit vinum vetus. Islyke vnto him that eateth ripe and pleaſant grapes, and drinketh olde wine.
                   I would therefore aduiſe all young men, that they ioyne them ſelues with the aged, and follow their godly counſels & wholeſome documents.Bias.

                   Wherfore let vs hearken vnto old men, & giue all reuerence & honour vnto them, neither let vs depart from their ſides, whoſe ſteps let vs follow for their great experiēce of things, for their great wiſdom & knowledge, let vs vſe their counſell, delight in their ſtudies, that we may haue the ſight of them, which may feare vs frō vices. Illi (inquit Diuus Ambroſius) erūt vitae noſtrae teſtes ſimul & magiſtri, ab illis percipiemus viuēdi normā, loquēdi modū, virtutū ōniū diſciplinā

                  They (ſaieth Saint Ambroſe) ſhal be witneſſes of our liues, and alſo teachers vnto vs, from them we ſhal perceiue the order to liue, the maner to ſpeake, the diſcipline of all vertues. And this may ſéeme true to all men, for that they haue had great experience in many things, they remember many things, they are alſo for the moſt part wiſer, and more apt to giue counſell, and to gouernment in all thinges whatſoeuer.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               There are many thinges nowe ſpoken of you, verie wel and wiſely of the honour and obedience of parentes, but as yet theſe children doe not vnderſtand throughly what this word obedience meaneth: wherefore I humbly pray you, that you would alſo vnloſe this knot vnto vs, and reſolue vs of this doubt, and other thinges which ſeeme to appertaine any thing to the knowledge of the fift commaundement, vouchſafe to declare more plainly vnto vs.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Nothing more willingly. Obedience in the ſcriptures generally is greatly allowed and eſtéemed, and chiefly that, wherein Parentes are to be honoured and obeyed: which the olde Fathers not vnfitly, haue called the mother of all felicitie. And Samuel ſaieth: Obedientiam meliorem eſſe victimis. Obedience is better than ſacrifice.
                   Obedience is a great good thing, and contrariwiſe: diſobedience is a wicked and outragious euill. A diſobedient ſonne (ſaieth a certaine man) is a cruell murtherer of his Parentes, for that there is no ſorow or griefe in the whole courſe and life of men greater, than that which ariſeth of the calamitie and wickednes of children, ſuch as was of our firſt Parentes or of Dauid, Let children conſider of theſe thinges, that it may increaſe in them a greater and more diligent care of obeying than heretofore.
               Saint Bernard commendeth this verie worthily, ſaying thus:Bernardus. 
                  Obedientia quae maioribus proebetur, Christo exhibetur, What obedience ſoeuer is ſhewed vnto our elders, is exhibited vnto Chriſt:
                   Nay rather hée ſaith: what thing ſoeuer man doth commaund in the ſtead of God, that is not directly againſt the worde of God, the ſame is altogether to be receiued, as if God had commaunded it. Parentes ſunt vicary Christi, ergo non ſpernendi, ſed honorandi. Parents are the Vicars of Chriſt, therefore not to be diſpiſed, but to be honoured.
                   For who ſoeuer contemneth the Vicar, contemneth him that placed

him. Baſilius Magnus teacheth, that Ieſus Chriſt was obedientBaſilius. to his mother Mary and Ioſeph, euen in verie ſmall thinges, as in fetching of water, and bearing of his axe and ſuch like, and thus he cryeth out: O example worthie to be immitated, O wholeſomeThe exclamation of Baſil.
                   document: Excellens Dei filius obedit homini, propter hominis ſalutē, & homo non vult obedire propter Deum & ſuam ſalutem, The excellent Sonne of God obeyeth man, for mans health and ſaluation, and man wil not obey for Gods cauſe and his owne ſaluation.
                   Ah, woulde to God all children out of this, woulde vnderſtand the honour due to their Parentes, out of this I ſay, that they haue Chriſt their Captaine and guider of their dueties, when they treade in his ſteppes, and execute their dueties preſcribed by their Parentes. Moreouer alſo this ought to incite and ſtirre vp all children excéedingly to the obedience of their Parentes: when they heare the whole obedience of the fift commaundement to haue beene ſanctified and conſecrated by the childe Ieſus. But now we muſt come to the declaration of the fift commaundement, in the which, if theſe children of Amuſus will ſhew them ſelues willing and attentiue, they ſhall adde vnto mée the greater quickneſſe of ſpirit and minde in the declaring and opening of the ſame.

               Reuerend Maiſter Doctor, we yeeld great thankes vnto you, for that you doe admoniſh vs ſo godly and louingly, And if you wil haue vs doe any thing, commaund it freely, and you ſhal finde vs readie to doe it, and wee wil ſhewe our mindes vnto you in the expounding of this thing, not only willing, but alſo attentiue and vigilant, euen as our Lorde God ſhal giue vnto vs the meaſure of his ſpirite.

               This worde (honour) comprehendeth two things, as it is ſaideA declaration of the fift precept or commaundement. before, an inward & an outward reuerence. Therfore y• firſt honor (which is commaunded here) is to knowe the things them ſelues, (that is to ſay) that wedlock, the ordering of a family or houſholde, and pollitical gouernment, were inſtituted & ordeined of God, and by his aide and mightie power preſerued, & that in theſe ordinaunces the preſence, wiſedome, goodnes and loue of God doeth ſhine towardes vs, & acknowledging theſe benefites, wée ought to render humble thanks to God the Author, & beſéech him to preſerue & defend vs, from our aduerſary the Deuil, the mortal enemy of mankinde,

which goeth about by all meanes hée can poſſibly deuiſe, t
                     •
                   diſſolue & breake this ſwéete & pleaſant harmony. Vnto this degrée of honor belongeth preaching or celebrating of theſe thinges: That the youth may learn, that they come frō god, & accuſtom thēſelues, to make their humble prayers & ſupplications vnto God, y• he will vouchſafe to preſerue theſe his own ordinaunces and giftes. And it is the part & duetie of a thankful minde, willingly to obey for gods cauſe, to beware of wicked & lewde examples, & of giuing occaſions to ſin, whereby good ordinaunces might be diſſolued & broken, & the lawes vtterly ouerthrowne & peruerted, & to conclude, by all poſſible meanes to preſerue & defend theſe things ſo néedful & profitable.
               The other part of honor cōcerneth the perſons (to wit) Parents, Magiſtrates, teachers, & whoſoeuer haue any gouernment ouer vs, There is a great vnlikenes of theſe things. But yet all men ought to follow this rule & platforme. Parentes & other gouernors ought to be a liuely lawe, (that is to ſay) the preſeruers & mainteiners of the diuine law. For who doth not vnderſtād that theſe perſons are to be loued & honored, by & through whō God doeth impart ſo great benefits (to wit) true religiō, godly lawes, iudgement, & peace vnto mankinde? Such gouernors were, Moſes, Ioſua, Samuel, Dauid, Solomon, Ioſephat, Ezechias, Ioſias, Cyrus, Cōſtantinus, & Theodoſius. Therfore there is an honour that doth behold & reſpect the perſons, to acknowledge this alſo the gift of God, to haue parents which do truly performe their dueties: for the ordinance itſelf or lawes without a kéeper, preſcruer, & one to ſée the ſame executed, are verie weake and of no force, as ſaith that Greciā: Validares lex est, quū principem habet. The law is a ſtrong & forcible thing, when it hath a Prince or Gouernor. And becauſe the preſeruation & maintenance of his own order, is acceptable vnto the Lorde God, the degrées ordeined of him, ought alſo to be kept inuiolable of vs. Therfore this ſhalbe y• ſum,The ende of the fift precept. that whoſoeuer the Lorde hath ſet to rule ouer vs, wée doe receiue them, enterteine & honor them, both with obedience & thākfulnes.

               Oh immortal God, how godly and wholſome things do we now heare concerning the honouring of Parents, of whom there hath been no mention made to vs at any time, It is our partes and dueties therefore to pray vnto God, that theſe ſo godly precepts, and neceſſarie doctrines do neuer ſlip out of our minds. And for that the Lord God hath now put this good

thing into our mindes, that we ſhould heare you now more willingly than heretofore: we beſeech your humanitie & curteſie, that you wil vouchſafe to ſhewe and declare vnto vs all other things touching the honour of Parents, and chiefly the loue of our elders.

                  Ideo inquit parentes chariſſimos habere debemus, quod ab his vita, patrimonium, libertas, ciuit as tradita est. Therefore ſaieth he, ought wee to eſteeme our Parents moſt deare, for that, we receiue from them life, patrimonie, libertie, and our Citie or countrie. Seneca ſaieth, Parentes non
                  Seneca. 
                  amare impiet as est, non agnoſcere inſania. Not to loue our Parentes is great impietie, not to acknowledge them is madneſſe.
                   And S. Auguſtine
                  D. Auguſt. ſaieth: Caninum est Parentes non agnoſcere. It is the nature and propertie of Dogges not to acknowledge our Parents.
                   And if it be a dogged nature not to acknowledge them, it is much more brutiſh to offēd them, to hurt, beate, and offer iniurie vnto them, as there be ſome ſuch in the world (the more to be lamented.)

                     , a noble woman condemned to death to be executed in the priſon. And when hée had ſent her vnto the kéeper of the priſon, hée being moued with pitie and compaſſion towardes the woman, did not foorth with execute her, but permitted her daughter to haue acceſſe vnto her mother, hauing great regard (as hée thought) that hée ſhould bring nothing vnto her for her nouriſhment and preſeruation, that might prolong her life, ſuppoſing that ſo within a litle while ſhée ſhould famiſh & pine away. And when many dayes were nowe paſt ouer, and the woman yetOf the daughter that nouriſhed her mother in priſon. liuing, hée muſing with himſelfe what ſhould be the cauſe, that ſhée was ſuſteined ſo long, watched her daughter now more narrowly than before, at the laſt hée eſpied the daughter giuing her mother ſucke of her full breaſts, which ſhée had prepared for the ſame purpoſe, alwayes againſt her comming thither, which ſo rare & wonderfull a ſpectacle when hée beheld, hée coulde not chooſe but make the Triumuir priuie thereof, and hée went and ſhewed the Pretor, and the Pretor opened the matter vnto the Conſuls, who graunted vnto the woman remiſſion and pardon for her fact before committed, and highly commended her for nurturing and bringing vp ſo naturall and louing a daughter.
               
                  And to the ende that children might bée the more excited and moued to the loue of their parents, I will ſhewe you another rare example. There is in the region and countrie of Scicilia the mountaine Aethna of an vnmeaſurable bigneſſe, which burning withAethna. continuall fire, caſteth out ſuch fiery flambes, and bloweth out ſuch burning ſtones, with ſuch violence and forcible maner, by means whereof the neighbours there aboutes bordering, ſuſteine no litle loſſe, hinderance, and perill. It chaunced therefore (in the 3510. yéere of the foundation of the worlde, after the Babilonicall deliuerance) that this Mountaine threw foorth ſuch forcible and mighty fiers, that the Citie Cathana was burnt and conſumed to duſt, as witneſſeth Panſania, ſaying: Et, arderent aruis ſegetes, & milliacultuiugera cum dominis, ſyluae colleſ

The corne fields a thouſande acrees with their furniture, together with the owners, the greene woods, vallies, and hilles were quite conſumed and burnt to duſt. So that whatſoeuer any man had, that hee eſteemed, hee did his beſt to conueigh and carry it out of this dreadfull and raging fire.
                   There were dwelling in the ſame Citie two brethren (to wit) Philonius

                   and Callias, which leauing golde, ſiluer, precious ſtones, and all other Iewels whatſoeuer: tooke vp their Parents vpon their ſhoulders (being now aged, and there withall ſo weake and féeble, and therefore not able to helpe them ſelues) deliuered them from the rage of that furious Fire, to the great admiration of the beholders.
               Thus were they deliuered, euen as the people of Iſrael in the red Sea, or the thrée brethren in the hot burning Ouen, whom Daniel ſpake of at large, to the great prayſe of Almightie God. And if theſe naturall affections of the Ethnickes and Heathen men▪ which do theſe things without faith, and the true knowledge of God, are to bée liked and allowed, how much more of Chriſtians, which are baptized in the name of Ieſus Chriſte?
               A like thing happened of one Cymon an Athenian, whoſe loue andCymon. pietie towards his Parents was ſo excéeding great, that the Lord God rewarded him wonderfully for the ſame (that is to ſay) with proſperitie and long life. For when his father Miltiades for the money which hée had borowed out of the common treaſury, was caſt into priſon, there to ſuffer famiſhment except he could pay the debt

and hée nowe almoſt pined and withered away. Cymon to the end that hée might nowe deliuer and redéeme his father, beſought the Magiſtrates, that hée might bée kept in priſon in the ſtéed of his father, vntill hée coulde pay thoſe thirtie thouſand crownes into the treaſurie (for ſo much hée ought). Cymon was receiued into priſon, the father was ſet at libertie, who not long after died, héere (to mans iudgement) Cymon was like to periſh for the loue he bare to his father. At the laſt a certaine famous and worthie Citizen being very rich tooke to wife the daughter of this Miltiades, who payd the money that was due for Cymon his brother in law, and ſo deliuered him out of that calamitie, perill, and miſery. There is no doubt but that it was Gods prouidence, that Cymon ſhoulde bee deliuered. For by this example, God would ſhewe himſelfe according to his promiſe, to render vnto obedient and louing childrē the rewardes of their godlineſſe, albeit they be ſtrangers from the Chriſtian faith.

               What childe is he, with ſo hard and adamant an heart, which cannot be moued and mollified with theſe examples? But there is one thing that I would faine heare of you, whether this obediēce, taketh place euery where without any difference, and that it is due to parents in al things?

               That I may expreſſe my minde more ſimply vnto you (reuerend Maiſter Doctor) this is the thing I would bee glad to know and vnderſtand of you, whether we ought to obey parents, magiſtrates, tutors, maiſters, and teacher, commaunding wicked and vngodly things, or not?

               Surely it is a very good queſtion, and very méete for theſe children, or rather all men of what ſtate and condition ſoeuer they bée, I will therefore willingly more at large declare the ſame for theſe childrens ſakes. Firſt euery man ought to knowe, that the precepts of the firſt table are to bée preferred before the laſt. Wherefore if parents, maiſters, or magiſtrates, woulde driue thée

from the worde, or true worſhip of God, and force and compel thée vnto vngodlineſſe: thou ſhalt anſwere with Saint Peter. Oportet Deo magis obedire quam hominibus. Wee muſt obey God rather then man.

                   a certaine time, who woulde haue had him a captaine againſt the Chriſtians, anſwereth him after this maner in few wordes, O King, you ſhall haue mée ready in what thing ſoeuer is, or ſhall bée néedfull, and you ſhall finde mée very willing, but in this buſineſſe (O king) I owe more duetie vnto my God, then vnto thée being king.

               What ſhall children doe, if they haue poore, ſimple, & feeble parents, not of the quickeſt wit, of baſe ſtocke and kinred, and yet crabbed and very wayward, are they alſo compelled to honor, loue, and obey them in all things?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               I thinke you doubt not of this point, yet for the goodwil I beare to Amuſus and his children, I will declare & open vnto you whatſoeuer may ſéeme to apperteine to this purpoſe, if ſo bée now I can call to my remembrance, thoſe things which héeretofore I haue read in good authours concerning this matter. Although ParentsThe perſons of pa are not to be reſpected but the will of God is to be conſidered. bee neuer ſo poore, baſe, ſimple, féeble, &c. They ought not for any of theſe cauſes to bée deſtitute and ſpoyled of the honor giuen them of God: for they ought not to behold their perſon (to wit) what maner men they hée: but héere the will of God only is to bée obſerued and regarded, which hath willed and commaunded it ſo, which alſo to this his commaundement, hath added a promiſe, farre more excellent then all the riches in this worlde: For who ſo doe truely and vnfeignedly honour their parents, there are promiſed vnto them of God in this world, long life, peace, health, and happy, and proſperous ſucceſſe in all thinges. But contrariwiſe, who ſo reſiſt the diuine worde of God, an vnhappie life, and that very ſhort, is ready to fall vpon them by and by, becauſe they haue diſobeyed the Lord of life. For theſe ſtubborne & rebellious wretches, are vtterly forſaken of God, and ſo become théeues, robbers, and murtherers, to their owne ſhame & confuſion. For with great diſdaine and hatred they contemne the good and godly inſtructions of Parents, and wil not ſuffer any correction or chaſtiſement, and ſo it often chaunceth that theſe varlots come very ſeldome vnto mature and rype age, but are cut of before their time. Neyther be they ſo happy, as that they fall into the handes of the hangman, whereby they may haue time to repent them of their former liues, but being ouercome with drunkenneſſe and ryot, behaue themſelues

in ſuch ruffianlie maner, that in their deſperate frayes, they dye of the ſworde, or by ſome other miſfortune, are ſlaine, or els by fier or water doe miſerably periſh. As in the children of Heli and in Abſolon, with many others hath béene ſéene. S, Gregory
                  
                     D. Grego. A horrible example of a child &c. hath left vnto our memory a horrible example of a certaine diſobedient childe, which of a wicked ſpirit was caught out of his fathers lappe, and in his ſight torne in péeces and deſtroyed: Héereof let children learn to feare and loue the Lorde God, and to honor their parents, & not contemn them although they be neuer ſo poore, wayward, or deformed. Let them alſo kéepe in memory the horrible example of Dathan and Abiron, which for reſiſting the MagiſtratesNum. 16. were ſwallowed vp quicke & throwne into Hell. The waywardneſſe & wrabbedneſſe of parents, doth not diſcharge the fift cōmandement, as witneſſeth S. Peter, ſaying: Non ſolum bonis, ſed ettam diſcolis obedite, Obey not only your good and wiſe parents, but alſo your wayward & fooliſh parents.
                   As alſo the Prophet Baruch ſaith. 2. Vult Iudaeos malis & imp
                        •
                     is obedire. God would haue the Iewes to obey their wicked & vngodly parents,
                   as hath bin ſaid before. Moſes doth not ſay honor yée, your good, wiſe, & rich parents, but ſpeaketh ſimply without any diſtinction or difference: Honora parentes. Honor thy parents.
                   But when God at any time ſendeth wrabbed, wayward, and hard hearted parents, this chaunceth for our ſinns & wickednes: For it maketh no matter to vs, whether they bée worthie or vnworthie, noble or baſe, rich or poore: for what maner parents ſoeuer they bée yet not without the great prouidence of God they are our parents. But who ſo thinketh that decript & doting parents are not to be honored and reuerenced. Let them heare now a notable example andAn example worthy to be remembred of an olde man. worthie to bee remembred, of a certaine houſholder, which had an olde father decript and bowed together with age, and therewithall doting and very childiſh againe, ſo that when the meates & things were ſet vpon the table, he would by and by ouerthrow the diſhes and pottes, & powre out the pottage vpon the table, to the great annoyance of the gueſts many times: but whē this had chanced thus very often, ye houſekéeper his ſonne begā to diſdain therat, & to take ye matter gréeuouſly, & ſtudied which way he might find a remedy, for this trouble, & at the laſt he deuiſed a trough or hollow thing to be made of wood, whereout he might eate his meat: And whiles the thing was in making & preparing, the young ſonne of this houſholder,

began to reaſon with his father, & demaunded of him to what vſe that ſhoulde ſerue (for hée knewe very well his father had no Swine to féede therein): his father anſwered: that hée had made it for his graundfather, that hencefoorth he may dine and ſuppe out of the ſame: Then the litle child aſked his father againe, ſaying after this maner. My good father, when you ſhalbe as old as my grandfather, ſhall I be compelled to make ſuch a hogges trough for you alſo? which wordes ſo ſoone as his father heard, he was excéedingly aſtoniſhed, and began to ſigh meruellouſly, and ſtraight way with great ſorrow of mind, hee threw from him the trough very diſdainfully, and began to bethinke with himſelfe what that childiſhe queſtion ſhould meane, & rightly wayed and conſidered with himſelf vnto how many great miſeries and calamities mans life was ſubiect inſomuch as after that, he euer gaue great honor & reuerēce vnto his old father, and neuer was offended after that, with the mad & doting pranckes of his father ſo long as hée liued.

For if ſuch and ſo wonderfull a naturall affection be in the bruite beaſtes and foules, which want both iudgement and reaſon: what naturall affection ought to bée in vs towards thoſe creatures which be partakers both of iudgement and reaſon: & beſides this, created vnto the image of the liuing God?

               Nowe woulde I gladly heare of you, what maner dueties of children are required towards their Parents, which if children had alwaies printed before their eyes, Parents ſhould haue them a great deale more obedient heereafter, for the ignorance of duetie hath been the diſtruction of many young men.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               The chiefeſt care of children toward their parents is this, thatOf the dutie of children towardes their parentes. before all things they ſtudie to loue them intirely: for as witneſſeth Plinie Amor optimus diſcendi magiſter. Loue is the beſt maiſter to learne any thing. For euery doctrine and teaching is much more eaſie tranſlated and conneighed into the minde of the childe, if hée loue his father: wherefore I iudge and thinke it conuenient that children are to bée admoniſhed, that they loue their parents no leſſe then their godly diſciplines, doctrines and chidings. For ſuche godlineſſe and pietie of children auaileth greatly to this purpoſe, they will heare more willingly, and giue credite to their wordes, and will couet and deſire to bée like them, they will not take it in ill part to be corrected, but they will reioyce to bée prayſed, & they wyll acknowledge that it is their fathers dutie to teach, and theirs to ſhew themſelues willing to be taught. Moreouer it ſhall bée the part and duetie of children to folowe the Godly precepts and counſels of their parents, and let them thinke that nothing ought to be attempted without the expreſſe wil & aſſent of their parēts, & what ſoeuer they know ſhall pleaſe their parents, y• ſhal they do without delay, And if they knowe what will diſpleaſe them, that ſhall they not goe about to attempt, nor touch by any meanes: & if they ſéeme

to bée too heard or vngentle vnto them, yet ſhall they beare it with a lowly and willing mind. Again, if they can deferue to haue their friendſhip by any meanes, they ſhal doe their beſt to the vttermoſt of their power. If they ſhall fall into any gréeuous ſicknes, pouertie, or extreeme olde age, it ſhalbe the childrens duetie willingly to relieue and comfort them by all poſſible meanes.

               Theſe be good leſſons for daughters in deed. But if a young man haue vngodly parents, infidels, and altogether ignorant of Gods lawes; is it not the ſonnes duetie to teach & inſtruct his father and mother?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Yea alwayes, albeit it be not an vſuall or common thing. For if a young man being a Chriſtian, haue vngodly Parentes, in whō hée would wiſh and deſire to haue ſowne the ſéedes of vertue & true knowledge of God, hée ought to endeuour him by all meanes poſſible, gently and reuerently to admoniſh them, that hée might draw them vnto pietie and the true knowledge of Chriſt, that at the laſt, being inſtructed in the will of God, of wicked and vngodly ones, he might make them godly and vertuous.

               Theodidactus.
               Certes none are more happie, than thoſe which truely performe their duties, & to whō it is giuē frō their childhood to repoſe al hope in one & y• true god, & with ſure cōfidēce to depēd of his only goodnes

prouidence, which thing appeareth to haue chaunced vnto Dauid. Pſal. 71. Where moſt faithfully hée ſpeaketh vnto God, ſaying thus: Quoniam tu es expectatio mea domine, Domine ſpes mea à iuuentute mea. For thou O Lord God art the thing that I long for, thou art my hope euen from my youth:
                   As though hée ſhould ſay, not now only, but hitherto alwayes through my whole life, thou art the thing I long for, and my hope: that is to ſay, Séeing that I haue had none other God from my youth vp, but thée alone, howe ſhall I now not call vpon thée in this trouble: And howe ſhalt thou forſake mee? Parentes are hereby admoniſhed, that they inſtruct their children from their youth in ſuch godlines, knowledge, fayth and hope of God, that they become not wicked & vnhappie, but continue bleſſed with God and all his holy Angels, and Saintes in heauen for euer. But this inſtruction (as I ſaid) ought to be proponed and ſet foorth vnto children euen from their young and tender yeares.
               Nam quod noua testa capit, inueterata ſapit.

               Theophilus.
               How happeneth it that ſo few inheritours left very wealthily by their Parentes: And alſo ſo few men ſeruantes and maydes, haue ſo litle happineſſe and proſperitie in this life?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Becauſe ſo fewe at this day regard to obſerue and fulfill the fiftWhy children, ſeruantes and maydes liue oftentimes moſt miſerably. commaundement, the breach whereof hath a curſe thereunto annexed: hereof it commeth to paſſe, that the great treaſures and poſſeſſions left vnto the heires, helpeth them nothing. It auayleth ſeruauntes and maydes nothing at all to labour and toile, and to

proll, filtch, and ſteale all their life long: For God doeth not bleſſe them for their contempt, & diſobedience towards their Parentes, Magiſtrates, Maiſters, Miſtreſſes and Dames. Hither may bée referred the examples of this preſent time (not to be numbred) of thoſe which haue béene left heires of very great poſſeſſions, are notwithſtanding at this preſent poorer than Irus, and liue in extreme miſerie.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Seeing that by many and diuers examples, and alſo daily experience itWhy the affections of children are more colde towards their Parents, than of the Parentes towards their children. ſelfe can teach vs, that all Parents (by a certaine guiding of nature) do truly and with all their heartes loue their children (which natural effect alſo appeareth in the wilde and ſauage beaſtes.) Howe commeth this to paſſe, that the children doe not loue their Parents againe, neither reuerence nor obey them, to whom neuertheleſſe they are bounde for all thinges which they haue receiued, yea the life it ſelfe?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               For that I perceiue in al families y• natural affectiōs & loue of childrenThe firſt cauſe of diſobedience. towards their parents, for the moſt part are more cold, weak, & faint, this happeneth of two cauſes chiefly. Firſt, the diſpoſitions and inclinations of children are ſo corrupted with the faultes and 
                     •
                  innes of our old & great Graundfather Adam, that they more feruently deſire to be beloued than their parents. Secondly, as ye Philoſophers do iudge, the parents are in the aſcendent degrée: but the children in the deſcendent degrée, and ſo falleth out their loue. Euen as a ſtone falleth more eaſily downwards than vpwards. Wherefore moſt true is that common ſaying: One father with a leſſe care and more chearfull minde can nouriſh and bring vp ten children, than ten children can comfort and cheriſh one father: hereof it may eaſily be iudged, how great the loue and readie good will of children is to helpe their parents in their neceſſities. Therfore they do very fooliſhly, which being poore and well ſtriken in yeares, doe looke for great aide & ſuccour frō their children: wherefore if they couet & deſire to take good counſel for thēſelues, they ſhal rather earneſtly endeuour to ſettle & repoſe al their whole cōfidence & truſt in y• which is the fountaine of all paternitie & goodnes. But yet more fooliſhly and vnaduiſedly do they which through too fond affection & loue being yet aliue, do yéeld & deliuer vp into the hands of their children, their goods, coyne, & all their inheritance, wholly perſuading them ſelues to liue more eaſily of the beneuolence & loue of their children,

whom oftentimes they finde very fooliſh, negligent and careleſſe, to their great loſſe, hindrance, and vtter vndoing, with their intollerable ſorrow and griefe all the dayes of their liues. When neuertheles Eccle. 33. ſetteth foorth vnto theſe olde men moſt wholeſome counſell. Filio, inquit Ieſus Syrach & mulieri, fratri aut amico, non des potestatē ſuper te in vita tua, non dederis alij poſſeſſionē tuā, ne fortè poeniteat te, & depreceris pro illis. Dū adhuc ſuperes & aspiras non immutabit te omnis caro. Saith Ieſus Syrach, giue not thy ſonne, thy wife, thy brother, nor thy friend, power ouer thee while thou liueſt: & giue not away thy goods & poſſeſsion to another, leſt it repent thee, and thou beeſt faine to beg therfore thy ſelf. As long as thou liueſt and haſt breath let no man chaunge thee: Melius est enim vt filij tui te rogent, quàm te reſpicere in manus filiorum tuorum. For better it is thy children to pray and intreat thee, than that thou ſhouldeſt be faine to looke into their handes ſaieth Syrach. Yet it is not the wil of God, y• they ſhould depart this life altogether without ye making & preparing of their laſt wil and Teſtament. But he would haue vs willing & readie to diſpoſe our goods, lands & poſſeſſions before our death, ſaying after this maner: In conſummatione dierū vitae tuae, & in tēpore exitus tui distribue h

               Theophilus.
               How commeth it to paſſe, that at this day, there is almoſt no dutie performed vnto Magiſtrates & Elders, nor any reuerence or regard vnto Parents? You haue taught vs afore that the infection of our corrupt nature is in fault: doe you not thinke, that there is ſome other thing that cauſeth this diſobedience and rebellion in children and ſeruants?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Yes verely. For another cauſe why children doo not obey & honorThe ſeconde cauſe why children are ſo diſobedient. their parents at this day, is y• filthy ſlothfulnes of parēts, & the negligence, & too much careleſnes, nothing beſéeming without dout, or méet for Chriſtians: For howe ſhall a childe kéepe & performe the precepts of the ſecond table, which is ignorant of the precepts of the firſt table? out of y• which as out of a fountaine iſſueth & procéedeth the dutie of parents & Magiſtrates, &c. And all other works of loue & obedience. It were therfore to be wiſhed, nay rather to be performed, that children & ſubiects ought diligētly to be inſtructed in the firſt preceptes, to ye end they might learn to know God, to truſt in him, to loue, feare, and worſhip him, to call vpon him, to giue him

thankes, to honor his holy name, & willingly to heare & learne his word: theſe & ſuch like if they were truely obſerued, then without doubt the good fruites of obedience ſhould by & by follow, wherfore in theſe things the greateſt care and diligence muſt be vſed.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Notwithſtanding albeit it is euidēt that youth is depraued & corrupted partly with the fault of our corrupt nature, & partly made worſe through the negligēce & too much cockering of parents: ſhal they not be vrged & pricked forward with ſtripes, & admoniſhed and ſtirred vp with examples & reaſons?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               The loue & reuerēce of young men towards their parents ſhal by no meanes neither more eaſily nor more aptly bee prouoked & ſtirred vp thē if they acknowledge their parēts to be the original cauſe of their birth, if they acknowledge them to bée the ſhop of their life, & to be briefe, the men, by whom we begin to be men: alſo we ſhall indeuour to honor & reuerence them with al our harts, if we weigh with our ſelues the greate and manifold charges, the gréeuous ſorrowes, and cares which they haue byn compelled to ſuffer for our ſakes, for they haue oftē ſpared frō their own bellies, to féede ours, brokē many ſléepes to quiet & pleaſure vs, afflicted with many gréeuous cares, and wéeried with labours, to the ende that they might prouide & get thoſe things y• might doe vs good & are neceſſary to the furtherance of our life, Beſides this with their admonitions they haue procured vnto vs the true catholike faith in God, and alſo the hope & loue of euerlaſting ſaluatiō, y• after this life ended, we might liue with God for euer: whē we vnderſtād y• theſe ſo great benefits are giuē vnto vs of our parēts, how ſhal we not loue them? & reuerēce thē with al our hearts at al times & in al places? this ſaying of Philo ſhal alſo ſtirre vp & moue children very much vnto the reuerencePhilo. of their parents, which ſaith: Quod Deus eſt mundo, hoc liberis Parentes eſſe arbitror: Looke what God is vnto the worlde, I iudge Parents to be the ſame thing to their children:
                   For as God made y• that was not, to the ende it might appeare: So they imitating his power as much as poſſible might be, doe make an immortall generatiō
                  Only the

                     . commaundement hath a promiſe. and linage by their progenies. Alſo it ſhal not a litle ſtirre vp the mindes of godly children to the loue of their Parentes if they ſhall rightly weigh and conſider that neuer one of the commandements hath any ſinguler promiſe, but only the 5. commandement. For by the name of long life is not only vnderſtood the cōtinuance of daies,

but alſo the tranquillitie and quietneſſe of this corporall life. But heere I am more full of wordes then the matter doth require: For ſéeing that youth doe now vnderſtand y• they receiue ſo great benefites frō their elders, ſurely except they haue hearts more hard then the Adamant, they woulde bee inflamed and incited by their owne accord vnto the honor and loue of their Parents, & ſhould neede no ſpurres nor ſuch prouocations and allurementes.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               It is very true my good Theodidactus. For it were the partes of wiſe & godly childrē willingly to be drawne to the obedience of their parēts. But what more ſpecial things are there to be deuiſed for children, which might more gladly & with greater affection moue them to the obedience of their Parents.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               For the better performing of this honor to their parents, childrē ought moſt ſpecially to remember (except they be altogether hardeWhat thinges do chiefly ſtirre vp children to the honor and obedience of Parentes. hearted & vnnatural) y• perils dolors & anguiſhes which their mothers ſuſtained & ſuffered for thē in their trauaile & birth: & therwt
                  al let thē diligētly cōſider with what greate paines, cares, frightes, ſorrowes & charges frō their infancy vpwards, they are brought vp of their parents, which thing they may more eaſily collect & gather by the education and bringing vp of other children and infantes. In like maner they ought to remember and ponder this one thing wel, that their children ſhalbe ſuch to them when they are parents, as they now ſhew themſelues towards their parents. But this asTo honor Parents is the moſt acceptable worſhip to God. yet is but a ſmall thing, for they ought diligently to conſider that to honour their Parentes is the moſt acceptable woorſhip to God that can bee, & that what dueties ſoeuer thou ſhalt performe to thy parents, the ſame God iudgeth & eſtemeth as done vnto himſelf the which alſo he wil recōpence, with many & great benefits: whē on y• cōtrary part (as is aforeſaid) he wil puniſh the impietie of children towards their Parents, with grieuous maledictions, plagues, and tormentes. There is a very profitable leſſon concerning theſe thinges in Eccle. 3. Which becauſe it is ſomewhat touched before I will here omit. Moreouer children ought to ſet before their eyes, the example of Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God who albeit he was the liuely image of his father, became neuertheleſſe obedient vnto his father euen to the death of the Croſſe. But if children when they bée adopted into Sonnes of GOD for Chriſt his ſake,

doe deſire to be made fellow heires of Chriſt in heauen: ſurely then very duety requireth, that they alſo follow the exāple of Chriſt his obedience in earth according to their ſeueral callings. For there bée among the very bruite beaſts, which when their Parents are well ſtriken in yéeres, do by courſe and turne requite them againe with foode & nouriſhment. Therfore what great diſhoneſtie, filthineſſe, deteſtation and villanie is it, if he which boſteth & vanteth himſelf, that he is not only a man indued with reaſon: but alſo beléeueth y• he is the adopted ſonne of God, bee ouercome of the bruite beaſtes with gratitude & kindnes towards their parents? Godly children ought to ſtudy, find out & practiſe theſe & ſuch like examples, that at the laſt willingly & by their owne minds they might be excited and drawne to the due obedience of their Parentes.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               O good God how profitable & how effectual be theſe things which hitherto you haue declared to the obedience of parents, but yet if you haue any other things in ſtore, which may ſeeme meete vnto you to bee vttered vnto vs, declare thē here I beſeech you, that the hearts of theſe children of our good neighbor Amuſus may the more eaſily bee bowed, & begin to ſerue & willingly obey the wil & minds of their parentes in all thinges.

               Al godly children & vertuous young men ought to cōſider & diligētly weigh, who is the Author & giuer of the 5. cōmandement (y• is to wit) almighty God, maker of heauen & earth, the diſpoſer & preſeruer of al things in them contained: & yet is not this ſufficient, except in like maner they doe cōſider, what & how great the maieſtie of God is, which hath cōmanded, ſaying: Honor thy father and mother &c And for that (I ſay) God is the author & giuer of this precept, many things hereof doe neceſſarily follow.

               I would be very glad to heare of you what might enſue & bee obteyned hereby: for there is no doubt, but that it ſhal bring great profit to the hearers, & they ſhal the better vnderſtand the fift commaundement.

But that I may be more briefe & at the laſt make an end of theſe things, the minds of children ſhalbe wonderfully ſtirred vp to honor their parents, if they rightly weigh with themſelues, what Moſes meaneth when he ſaith: Honor thy father & mother▪ for although their parents be mē, yet doth not Moſes ſay, honor thē, as they are mē, but honor thy father & mother, as though he ſhoulde ſay, honor thē whō

Therefore let children & young men learne to reuerence and obey their parents, & to hold theſe vocables & titles, (father & mother) in great price & for moſt ſacred reliques. And let them rather wiſhe to die, then willingly & obſtinately to offende them: for parents haue nothing in this life, wherein they are more affected and delighted, then in the loue of their children, and therfore moſt eaſily offended, when they doe any thing contrary to their liking.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               I maruel nothing more (O Theodi.) thē why parents are moued with ſo great loue & delight in their childrē, wheras they oftētimes on the cōtrary part, proue very vnkind, wicked & vnnatural towards their parentes.

               There be many cauſes why parēts are ſo affected towards their childrē, but y• firſt & chiefeſt cauſe of al is god, which hath created, & put into the mindes of parentes ſuch a moſt perfect & true natural affectiō towards their children, y• if at any time their minds be hurt ſtrickē & wounded wt ſorrow & heauines of heart for y• calamitie ofRebellious children doe ſtay their parents very often, not with ſword, but with ſorowe and heauineſſe of heart. their childrē, y• ſame is a moſt preſēt▪ plague & poyſō to their liues: ſo y• they are eaſily ſ

But youth beeing ignoraunt and vntaught, doe not conſider nor vnderſtand

this: wherefore I thinke it good that they bée admoniſhed and that with great care and diligēce, leaſt they become manquellers, and murtherers of father and mother. For they kill and murther their parēts very often before they vnderſtand the greatneſſe of their ſinne and wickedneſſe, becauſe they knowe not with what great ſorrow and griefe, their parents are vexed and inwarly gréened for the vntowardnes and wickedneſſe of their children, but the parents féele it, wither away, languiſh and are conſumed, euen to the bones many times, for the very anguiſh of heart & vexation of minde. Therfore it is not without cauſe that in the 5. commandement, the Lord our God hath vſed this vocable & word (honor:) For he doth not ſay, obey thy parents, but honor them: hée would haue this name to be accounted holy: becauſe God knowe well enough the malice of our originall ſin, whoſe force & violence is ſo great, that it moueth and vrgeth men to the ſlaugtter of their own natural parents, as may be ſéene in Eſau Abſolon and others, (I would it might not be ſéene in our time.) I do exhort therefore all young men, y• they ſhun & deteſt this horrible ſinn, and exerciſe their mindes vnto the reuerence of their parents, and that they may performe this y• better, let thē craue & inſtantly deſire the aid and aſſiſtāce of Almightie god in their dayly & continuall prayers.

you moſt louingly haue been willing in all things to ſatisfie my minde in ſuch ſort, that I neuer had any hope to heare from any man ſo many and ſo excellēt things, as I haue heard from your mouth. But now I am of this mind, that I would be right glad to haue thoſe my ſonnes (whoſe wits I ſhal perceiue neither to be too dull nor blockiſh, nor altogether alienated and eſtraunged from the Muſes) trained vp in Chriſte his Churche, and I would be glad to haue them miniſters and preachers of his worde: not to the ende that they ſhould gather and heape vp to themſelues great riches and ſo to liue at their eaſe and pleaſure, as many do now a daies (the more to be lamented) but rather that they ſhould endeuour (to the vttermoſt of their power) to deliuer out of Satans chawes, many ſoules now vexed & tormented, and ſo gaine them vnto Chriſte. And becauſe alſo it is an excellent thing to excell in vertue, to doe good to our Countrie, to teach others, to know themſelues, and to ſearch out the ſecrets of nature.

               My good Amuſus, there is no cauſe, why you ſhould feare the difficultie and hardnes of this godly function: for all things are poſſible with God. For Chriſt hath called fiſhers, and made them rulers of his Church. The ſpirite of God worketh effectually in the heartes of thoſe that beleeue and call vpon his name: wherefore ſee that you powre out your ardent prayers before the Lord God, for your children, and that with great care and diligence, & doubt you nothing at all of Gods promiſes.
            
            
               Amuſus.
               So I doe to the vttermoſt of my power, and according to my ſlender capacitie: For he knoweth, which is the onely ſearcher of the heartes and reines, how earneſtly I doe deſire to haue my ſonnes the inſtrumentes of the holy Ghoſte, by meanes whereof the doctrine of the Goſpel might bee inlarged in the Church of God. But is our prayers and the inuocating of God ſufficiēt to the going about this matter of ſo great a charge, as it was in the time of the Apoſtles? Or be there any other meanes annexed for the better perfourming of this charge and duetie?
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               Yea verily, for in the time of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, GodThe knowledg of the tongues is neceſſary to the ſtudie of diuinitie. for the moſt part wrought miraculouſly, & in ſetting out his worde immediately by the working of the holy Ghoſt only, but nowe in this our age hée manifeſteth him ſelfe more often through the gift of tongues: (that is to ſay) not only in the knowledge of the Latine tongue, but alſo of the Gréeke and Hebrew: not that the holy ghoſt is now made a ſtranger from the Doctors of our Church, but thus hath it pleaſed his maieſtie, and ſéemed good to his diuine wiſdome, that he doth not alwaies rule and teach his Church, or make himſelfe manifeſt after one maner.
            
            
               Amuſus.
               If then I couet and deſire to haue my ſonnes true diuines and teachers in the Church (as farre as I can gather by your reaſons and argumentes) they muſt excel in learning, & in the knowledge of the tongues, they muſt alſo be well and perfectly inſtructed.

of my wordes. For all mankinde was created to this end, that hée ſhoulde perfectly knowe, cal vpon, confeſſe, and glorifie God the father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: not according to our owne imaginations, but according to the doctrine which God himſelfe hath ſet foorth vnto men, & which with his owne finger hée hath written in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, in which hée teacheth vs how and after what maner hée will bee worſhipped, which bookes hée hath commanded al men to reade, heare, & learne. 1.

                   By theſe places it may eaſily bée gathered that God woulde haue all men reade, and vnderſtand thoſe bookes of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, and teache them vnto others, and vndoubtedly hée will condemne all thoſe, which doe not receiue, or doe contemne thoſe holy and moſt ſacred bookes.
               Wherefore ſuch as are conuerſant among the wiſe and learned can eaſily iudge, how profitable and alſo how neceſſary the knowledge of tongues is, and the perfect inſtruction of good artes. For the Paſtor which ſhall receiue the office of teaching in the Church of GOD, it is very méete and conuenient that he excell the ſhéepe committed vnto him in doctrine and knowledge, that hée may be able rightly to diſcerne true from falſe doctrine, and y• he may alſo be able ſtoutly to driue away the wolues from his ſhéepfold, but that ſhal hee neuer doe, if hee ſhall bee vnlearned, and ſhall not bee able too holde the ſumme of the doctrine of the Apoſtolike Church.
            
            
               Amuſus.
               You haue ſufficiently and plainely taught vs, that all men are made to the end that the knowledge of God might ſhine in them. Then againe you haue added heereunto (to wit) that for the comprehending of this knowledge, the knowledge of tongues, and right inſtruction of liberal arts is very neceſſary, and ſuch knowledge and inſtruction is required in the Miniſters of the worde of God, this haue you ſhewed with great and forcible arguments. And ſeeing the caſe ſo ſtands (moſt reuerend Theodi.) to

I am nowe to deſire and intreat you, that you would nowe moue and ſtir vp the mindes of my ſonnes vnto learning, that in the ſtudie of good arts, they might be made more chearful and willing: which ſhal eaſily come to paſſe, if you wil vouchſafe to ſhewe and declare heere before them ſome thinges of vertue, learning, and of the praiſe of godly inſtructing and education: For you wil ſcarcely beleeue, what great account my children doe make, both of your ſelfe, and your learned talke and conference.

But firſt (that I may tell you what I think) I doe not only iudge, that it is meete to learne, but in a frée Citie, I ſcarcely iudge any man worthy to deſerue the name of a frée Citizen, without learning: for I knowe not among the inuentions of men, whether any thing may be ſaide or thought more excellent.

earneſtly (in my iudgement) they are to be moued vnto vertue and godlines: For what ſhall it profite to haue the knowledge of many artes and ſciences, if the loue of vertue and true godlineſſe ſhall bée wanting.

               What maner difference doe you put betweene wicked and vngodly young men, and thoſe that are indued with godlineſſe, vertue, wiſedome and honeſtie?
            
            
               Theodidactus
               A very great difference ſurely: For the godly youthes indewedThe difference betweene the affections of the godly and vngodly. with vertue, are wholy giuen to the redreſſing of their own faults cleanſing and purging of the imperfections of their adoleſcencie, & héereof they will bee very carefull day and night: But the wicked and vngodly haue none other care, then howe they may obey the luſtes of their fleſhe, and inioy their wicked and filthie wyſhes.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               It commeth now to my remembrance, howe I haue heard you often tel the excellēt tale of the poets cōcerning Hercules, which very ſtoutly & with noble courage (all fond delightes and pleaſures ſet apart) ſought after vertue and renowme: I heartely intreate you that you will recite it heere, to the end theſe youthes might the rather bee ſtirred vp and inflamed vnto vertue, whoſe example if they indeuour to imitate and follow, it ſhall turne to their great praiſe and profite.
            
            
               Theodidactus.
               There is nothing truer without doubt. The Poets doe ſhewe,A tale of Hercules.
                   that it chaunced when Hercules was young, he went foorth into the wilderneſſe, and lighting on a forked and croſſe way, hée ſtoode ſtill a good while, doubting which way he were beſt to take, there ſtoode by him two matrones (that is to ſay) Virtus & voluptas, this one very fine, brauely attired, and looking vpon him with a merry and flickering countenance: that other ſad, heauie, & but homely apparrelled. And when this delicate Dame did offer and promiſe vnto him, that if hée would chooſe her wayes, hée ſhoulde haue with her, mirth, ioy, wealth and the abundance of all worldly pleaſures: But the other could aſſure him of nothing but hunger, thirſt, heat,The example of Hercules.
                   colde, and whatſoeuer ſadneſſe, heauineſſe, hardneſſe and horrour might bée deuiſed, but the end and rewarde of theſe thinges, ſhall be at the laſt, the inioying of the euerlaſting felicitie in heauen, with the ſight of the Godhead, and felowſhip of the Angels and Saints. He taking the more excellent and wholſome counſell, choſe rather

to follow the way of vertue, albeit for the preſent time more hard, daungerous and odible: But ſurely there are very few that will follow Hercules in this point.
               Moreouer, what the Poets doe declare of Hercules, that doeth the holy Scripture truely teſtifie to haue chaunced vnto Moſes,
                  The example of Moyſes.
                   which as S. Paul ſaith 11. Hebraeorum: Moſes when he was great, refuſed to bée called the ſonne of Pharaos daughter: choſing rather to ſuffer aduerſitie with the people of God, then to inioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon: eſteeming the rebukes of Chriſte greater riches then the treaſures of Egypt: For hée had reſpect vnto the the recompence of the reward. A good and faithfull father of family, and maiſter of houſhold, ought alwaies to propone and ſet foorth ſuch examples as theſe, vnto his children and ſeruants, that at the laſt hée may reduce and bring them into the way of vertue: but the youth which cannot bee moued by theſe and ſuch like examples, are very dull, blockiſh, and muſt needes bée enſtraunged from all vertue and godlineſſe.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               As the ſtudies of good Artes, and vertue are ſo nigh kinne, and ſo wel agreeing betweene themſelues, that the one cannot, neither ought to bee without the other: So I iudge this third thing (to wit) the ſtudie of wiſedome meete to bee added vnto them, without the which thoſe two are but as dumbe images, or rather of things hauing no life. Wherfore I iudge it worth your labour, if you will alſo vouchſafe to exhort theſe children vnto the ſtudie of wiſdome.

Ieſus Syrach ſaith: Qui diligit
                  Eccle. 9. eodem. 4. 6. 
                  ſapientiam, diligit vitam. Hee that loueth wiſedome, loueth his life.
                   If thou wilt vow down thine eare, thou ſhalt receiue doctrine, and

if thou delighteſt in hearing, thou ſhalt be wiſe. A wiſe man ſhalbée filled with bleſſing, and ſhall purchaſe honor among the people and his name ſhall liue for euer.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Surely theſe are worthie praiſes of wiſdome: but I haue hearde that wiſdome is two folde (to wit) humane, and diuine, wherefore it ſhall bee needefull, were it not for your trouble, to ſhewe and expreſſe vnto theſe youthes, what wiſdome it is that Solomon ſo highly commēdeth heere.
            
            
               Theodidactus,
               It is moſt certaine that Solomon doeth not commend in this place, that humane wiſdome which was knowne to the Philoſophers: but heere is mention made of that wiſdome, by the which that wholeſome knowledge of the diuine mercie of God is manifeſted vnto vs, through the which, by the blood of Chriſt, wée do obteine remiſſion of ſinnes and eternall life. Of which alſo Solomō ſpeaketh in the 8. Pro. which place I would were diligently read, & carefully meditated of al godly young men, whereby might be kindeled in them more & more the ſtudie of true wiſdome & godlineſſe. For there doth wiſdome her ſelfe ſpeake after this maner; I can giue councel & bée a guide, equitie is mine, I haue vnderſtanding and ſtrength: through mée kings doe raigne, and princes make iuſt lawes, through me doe princes beare rule, and all iudges of y• earth execute iudgement. I am louing vnto thoſe that loue me, and they that ſéeke me early, ſhal find me. Riches & honor are with me, yea excellent goods & righteouſnes: my fruite is better then gold & precious ſtone, and mine increaſe more worth then fine ſiluer &c. O yeThe comendations of wiſedome. young men, which haue but euen nowe begunne to ſalute wiſedome at the thraſholde, are yée not delighted and rapt with the loue of this moſt excellent wiſdome? which both can & wil adourne & inrich you with ſo many excellent qualities: How can you I ſay hold your ſelues from her? which willingly offereth herſelfe vnto you laden with ſo great riches and iewels, which he hath purpoſed fréely to put into your boſomes, except yée do vtterly contemn & reiect her with theſe ſo excellent treſures, which commeth vnto you, adourned with ſo great glory, that the Sunne cannot bée compared vnto her, with all his reſplendent and glittering beames: wherfore I pray you, which of you is ſo drowfie, or rather ſo mad,

which ſtraight way will not runne to hir and with lowlie and ardent requeſt and ſute, ſeeke for her familiaritie and loue? which to be ſhorte, of all the auncient Fathers and wiſe men from the beginning hath euer moſt diligently béene ſought, knowne, beloued, and commended. As the writinges alſo of Clement doe teſtifie,Clement. ſaying: Melior eſt ſapientia quam vires, Wiſedome is better then ſtrength.
                   And agayne, Multitudo ſapientum conducit orbiterrarum. The multitude of wiſe men doe guide and gouerne the whole earth.
                   And a little after: Omne aurum in comparatione ſapientiae arena eſt exigua. All the Golde in the worlde in compariſon of wiſedome, is but as a little ſand.

Iohn teacheth that we muſt not giue our ſelues to the vain inticements of the world, whē he ſaith: Loue not the world, neither the things of this world, if any man loue the worlde, the loue of the father abideth not in him. Saint Paul giueth vs this exhortatiō, ſaying: Flée fornicatiō: Euery1. Cor. 6. ſin that a man doeth, is without the bodie: but hée y• committeth fornication, ſinneth againſt his own bodie. And vnto the Epheſi. hée

Luke. 21. ſaith: Take héede vnto your ſelues, leſt at any time your hearts be ouercome with ſur fitting & drunkennes. Ephraim, teacheth young men to flée the abuſe of wine ſaying: By wine ye ſpiritual eyes are blinded, iniquitie is multiplied, the venomous ſwéetnes of luſt is ſtirred vp, the execrable filthines which is againſt nature, is inuented. Wherfore S. Paul ſaieth: Noli bibere vinum, in quo eſt luxuria Drink no wine, wherin is riotouſnes & exceſſe.
                   And it is certaine, that of the ſuperfluous drinking of wine procéed many euils, which we may learne by the anſwere ofAnacharſis.

                   It was a ſigne of great moderatiō in this Philoſopher, that hée imputed vnto the wine, the malepertnes and diſordered behauiour of this young man. For thoſe that immoderatly ſhall drinke wine, chiefly at that age, to which water better agreeth & is more conuenient, ſuch verie often are compelled to drinke water when they are olde, by reaſon of their pouertie, when neuertheles, the vſe of wine vnto that age were moſt méet and neceſſarie.

Hereupon there was a reaſoning amongſt the gueſtes who it ſhould bée, which the young man perceiued, and began to bluſh, and after that, he eat his meat more leaſurely▪ and with greater moderation than before.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               Verely, that young man which hath purpoſed with him ſelfe to walke in the wayes of the Lord God, in all thinges, muſt both obſerue and flee many things: but yet in my iudgement, there cannot be a more foule and horrible vice in a young man than whoredome and filthie luſtes. Wherefore I beſeech you, if you haue any thing that may tend to the deteſtation of this ſo horrible a vice, diſcloſe them vnto vs, that the heartes of theſe children may bee throughly terrified, and that they might not only ſhunne ſo pernicious and deteſtable a ſinne both to bodie and minde, but alſo loath it with their whole heart.

                   kéeping the daughters of Darius being taken priſoners, and when his friendes perſuaded him, that hée ſhould▪ goe and lye with thoſe faire and bewtifull women: Turpe foret, inquit, virorum victores, à mulieribus vinci, It were a foule ſhame and reproch (ſaieth hee) that the conquerours of men, ſhoulde no we bee vanquiſhed of women.
                   But nowe will I ſet before you certaine notable examples concerning this vice of adulterie. It is written in the third Chapter of theAgainſt Adulterers. Sapi. 3. 4.
                   booke of wiſedome, The children of aduouterers, they ſhall come to an ende, and the ſéeds of an vnrighteous bedde▪ ſhall be rooted out, and though they liue long, yet ſhall they bee nothing regarded▪ and their laſt age ſhall be without honour, &c. And in the fourth Chapiter hée ſaieth: The multitude of vngodly children▪ is vnprofitable▪ and the thinges that are planted with whordome, ſhall take no déepe roote, nor laye any faſt foundation, hereby let yong men learne, that adulterie greatly diſpleaſeth the maieſtie of God. And let them hearken to the wholeſome counſell of the Prophet▪ ſaying: I haue made a conenaunt with mine eyes, that I woulde not once thinke of a virgine, or els let them giue care to this that Iob ſaieth: Auerte faciem tuam à muliere compta,
                  Iob. 31. 
                  & ne circumſpicias ſpeciem alienam, propter ſpeciem mulieris multiperierunt. Turne away thy face from a gorgeous and fine decked woman, & behold not her ſtraunge bewtie, for many haue periſhed through the bewtie of women▪
                     
                   By theſe it appeareth, that adulterie is a gréeuous ſinne, and prohibited and gréeuouſly puniſhed of God, as theſe places of ſcripture doe teſtifie. Geneſis. 12. 20 Leuiticus 20. Deutro. 22. Ieremie. 3. Therefore it is néedefull that young men ſet before them the commaundements of God, touching vnlawfull luſtes, and the horible wrath of God for the ſame. And againe, let them conſider the puniſhments and plagues both of the people of God, and alſo of the, Heathen. Howe many ſtaughters, battailes, deſtructions, ſpoyles and vtter ruines haue procéeded from this vice. Straying luſtes were the cauſe of the deluge or flood, and after the flood, the deſtruction of ye Sodomites. Numeri. 25. There were ſlaine. 24 thouſande, for whoredome and aduoutrie. After that almoſt the whole tribe of Beniamin were deſtroyed for violating the wife of the high Prieſt, Dauid alſo ſuffred gréeuous puniſhments for his adulterie.
               
                  The hiſtories of the Gentiles bée very many: as the deſtruction of Troy. The expulſion of the kings of the Romans. The children of Piſiſiratus murthered at Athens. Phillip of Macedonia was ſlaine for his wicked luſtes. And Alexander periſhed in the middeſt of his delights and pleaſures. The Lacedemonians were ouerthrowne and deſtroyed. And Ariſtotle in his Politikes and bookes of ciuill gouernment hath gathered together many examples, in the which hée leaueth to our memory what common wealths haue béen moleſted, altered, and vtterly deſtroyed through luſt and deſire of Soueraigntie. Let young men diligently conſider theſe moſt lamentable and feareful examples, and flée ſuch like plagues and puniſhments, leaſt the fire of gods wrath conſume them.

               By theſe your words (my reuerend Theodidactus) wee are throughly perſuaded that matrimonie is inſtituted and ordeined of God, honorable, holy, and the very effectuall remedie againſt this outraging luſt, wherfore heereafter throwe this your counſell or rather the determinate will of God, after that wee ſhall perceiue and vnderſtande theſe our ſonnes and daughters to bee of type yeeres and good diſcretion, wee will carefully beſtowe them in marriage. But before wee ſpeake any further of marriage, I beſeech you moſt hartily, that if ſo be you haue any other weapons, engins, or antidotes, againſt this miſchief, you would cōmunicate & impart them vnto vs, leaſt our children before marriage fall vnto whoredome, and after in to adulterie.

And more then this which caſteth vs alſo into the moſt vile ſtate & condition of beaſtes

which were deſtinate and appointed to the fellowſhip of Angels, and communion of the diuine and heauenly creatures. Beſides this, let him conſider how ſhort and momentarie a thing it is, and how corrupt, hauing alwayes mingled therewithal more gal then honie: and on the contrarie, how precious a thing the ſoule of man is, and how holy a thing the body ought to be, which is the habitacle for the ſoule. Therfore what great madnes is this, that for ſo litle a tickling and filthie motion of ſo ſhort a pleaſure, to pollute and defile both ſoule & body together in ſuch wicked and vnſéemely maner? to prophane the temple of God which Chriſte hath conſecrated vnto himſelfe with his moſt precious blood? Let him way this alſo, what a heape of miſchiefs this flattering plague bringeth with it. Firſt it taketh away the good name, the moſt precious poſſeſſion that a man can haue in this worlde, it waſteth the patrimonie,The fruits of wicked luſts. it decaieth the ſtrength of the body, it hurteth the health, it procureth ſickneſſe and diſeaſes, and that moſt dangerous and filthie, it defaceth the flowre of youth before the time, it haſteneth old age, it taketh away the vigor and force of the wit, it dulleth the quickeneſſe of the minde, it calleth a man from all honeſt ſtudie, & drowneth him altogether in filthineſſe, ſo that after he giueth his minde to nothing, but ſluttiſh, vile, and filthie things, and it depriueth a man of the vſe of reaſon, which is moſt proper vnto him, and what miſchief or plague either to body or ſoule is there not, that this one vice doth not bring with it:

For in the time of Saint Ambroſe Parentes had great reſpect and regarde vnto this, that they woulde not beſtowe nor giue their daughters in marriage vnto infidels: But the Bridegrome ready to bée married, before the ſolemnizing of the marriage ſhoulde giue his name to Chriſt, and ſet foorth, and ſhewe a true confeſſion of the Chriſtian faith. Woulde GOD this order were nowe obſerued of all Parents in this our time, for then ſhoulde they beſtowe their Daughters muche better then they doe, for the moſt as wee ſee the thing was obſerued diligently among the Iſraelites.

                   For who ſo matcheth withfarre richer wiues then themſelues, they ſeldom

acknowledge them for their huſbands, but rather account them as bondmen of their dowrie. And Menander ſaith: Vxorem ducito ex aequalibus, ne ſi ex ditioribus duxeris, dominos tibi pares, non affines, imo fugiendae ſunt pecunioſae vxores: quia pecunioſa vxor, non eſt vxor ſed verius imperioſa domina.

The Poet Ennius, perſwadeth vs to marry ſuch, as are of pure and perfect chaſtitie, & of comely ſtature, (though ſomewhat browne▪) which alſo Aulus Gellius declareth and affirmeth, ſaying: Eas ſtat
                        •

                  are neither the faireſt, nor yet the fouleſt or harde fauoured, but haue a certaine meane (as wée commonly vſe to ſay, ſhee is neither faire nor foule, but browne louely:) which mediocritie in all things verily, is to bee commeded and praiſed. And this comely ſtature (out of doubt) is ſufficient and beſt agreing for the procreation of children. For comelineſſe and ſéemly proportion in women auaileth very much, euen as in the men a good countenance, a comely ſtature, with wiſdome and diſcretion is to bée wiſhed, and moſte acceptable vnto a woman. Therfore in a wife, not beautie and fineneſſe: but vertue and godlineſſe is to bée reſpected, as Michael Verinus ſaith very properly in theſe verſes:

                  The faire and beautifull let be, to other wights (I ſay▪)
                  the vertuous and the modeſt maide get thou (if that thou may.)
                  For beautie hindereth chaſtitie, (of this thou maieſt bee ſure)
                  the maide that beautie doeth poſſeſſe, chaſte hardly ſhall indure.
                  For ſome with wordes will her aſſault, and ſleights of Venus vſe,
                  and ſome with gold will her allure, which ſcarſce ſhe will refuſe.
               
               Theſe and many other thinges are to bée wayed and conſidered in the choyſe of a wife, and chiefly this, that thou choſeſt one like to thy ſelfe in religion, ſtocke wealth and comelineſſe: for the vnlikeneſſe of theſe things: is oftentimes the occaſions of contempt and continuall brawling and chiding.

vnto two great troubles, firſt hée muſt deuiſe and labour by all meanes poſſible, to make her forget the manners and qualities of her firſt huſbande: ſecondly, hée muſt acquaint her verie warely with his owne nature and qualities, and make her to haue a good opinion & liking of himſelfe, and of his maners, both which hee ſhal hardly doe, without great pollicie and diſcretion.

For what is more grieffull and more miſerable, than a marriage enterpriſed and begunne ſo wickedly, or a knot ſo vnluckely knit, that it cannot bée vnloſed againe all the dayes of our life? wherein wée ſhall continually be exerciſed in ſorrowe, vnquietneſſe, and brawling, detayned in miſerie, miſfortune and calamitie, out of the which wee can neuer wynde our ſelues, nor be deliuered, excepte it be by death. Truely youth muſt néedes fall into great perilles and daungers, when neglecting and contemning the authoritie of their Parents, they aſpire and ſtudie by all meanes poſſible to attaine vnto marriage, making them priuie nothing at all, vntill the matter be paſt remedie, and ſo begin their wedlocke in ſin and diſobedience, which God will neuer bleſſe nor proſper: But contrariwiſe, if they will endeuour to kéepe the commaundementes of Almightie God, and to honour and obey their Parentes, then hée hath promiſed to loue them, and will beſtowe his bountifull liberalitie and bleſſings vpon them. In the meane time, Parents ought not to neglect their dueties in beſtowing and matching of their children, for when the time ſerueth, and the occaſion is offered of God, to beſtowe their ſonnes or daughters vnto matrimony, then ſhal they not doubtfully

diſpute and reaſon about the dowrie, ſtocke, or Parentage, and to ſéeke a knot in a ruſh (as they ſay) or to detract and prolong the time without iuſt cauſe, but the will of God muſt alwayes be reſpected and obeyed, and the honour, health, eſtimation, and credit of the perſons muſt be rightly weighed and conſidered.

Franciſcus Barbarus is of the ſame minde, ſaying after this maner: We doe forewarne & tell you, that there can be aſcribed no excellencie or worthineſſe vnto y• mariage, to the which the good will & conſent of the father hath not béene had before.

That he would not marrie her, before he had heard from the mouth of his Parentes, that ſhe was a meete match for him, & a woman worthie praiſe and commendation.
                   By the example of this noble King, all young men may be admoniſhed, that they linke not them ſelues in matrimonie, except firſt they conferre, & deſire the good will and cōſent of their Parentes, maiſters, and gouernours: For if Parentes at all times, & in all places be to be honoured, reuerenced, & regarded, and that in the ſmalleſt thinges, much more in ſo great and waightie a cauſe, the wiſe & prudēt counſell of parents is to be heard, followed and embraced, except a man will make no account nor reckoning of the commaundement of Almightie God

It is the parte and duetie of Parentes to place and beſtow their children, and not of the children to beſtowe them ſelues at their pleaſure (albeit it is great reaſon that their willes and conſents agrée thereunto) and the ordinance of God requireth the ſame.

And as the children haue this libertie, to be willing and giue their conſents vnto their contractes in marriage, and that their Parents ought not to force them againſt their willes: So is it not lawfull for the children to contract and ioyne them ſelues in matrimony at their owne willes and pleaſures, without the authoritie & conſent of their Parentes. For it is the ordinaunce of God▪ that children honour and obey their Parentes, and follow their mindes & counſell in contracting them ſelues vnto mariage. Moſt gr

               Thoſe priuie ſpouſages and ſecret contractes therfore; enterpriſed and taken in hand without the conſent of Parentes, are not to be liked, approued nor allowed, as farre as I can gather of your wordes.

               You gather of my wordes verie wiſely, for theſe ſtollen & priuie contractes, affiances and betrothinges, are not only forbidden and prohibited by the lawes of Princes, but alſo by examples and teſtimonies out of the holie ſcriptures, as wée haue before ſufficiently proued.
               
                  Therefore let Parentes beare this alwayes in minde, that the right and authoritie to place and beſtowe their children, is giuen and attributed vnto them of God: And let children knowe, that they (as it hath béene often ſaid) owe this reuerence and obedience vnto their Parentes, that they ſéeke for their counſell, and earneſtly craue and deſire their good wils in theſe caſes That young man which is of age, wiſedome, diſcretion, and méet to take a wife, may not be afraide nor aſhamed, to reueale his ſecretes, and open his minde vnto his Parentes, that hée woulde be glad (if it were his fathers pleaſure) to match him ſelfe with ſome honeſt and godlie mayde, and therfore humbly deſireth his Parents good will, counſell, and furtheraunce in that behalfe, that of many of his familiers and acquaintaunce, hée might chooſe ſuch a one as ſhould bée to their liking: And albeit this may ſéeme to be ſome ſigne of luſt and vnſhamefaſtneſſe, yet let them know and vnderſtand, that the diuine clemencie doeth couer this in marriage, and addeth a remedie vnto this diſeaſe and malladie. Therefore let children humble them ſelues before their Parentes, and moſt lowly and gentely ſay, (my good father and mother) let mée haue I pray you ſuche a honeſt and godly young man or mayde, whom I loue in the feare of the Lorde, and in the way of wedlocke and lawfull matrimony, if hée or ſhée ſhall be thought worthie and meete for your affinitie, kindred, ſtocke, and Parentage, honeſt and wiſe Parentes will not deny the thing, that is in ſuch wiſe ſo honeſtly, & in ſuch humble maner required, although the dowrie, goods, or ſummes of mony, be not altogether anſwerable to their deſire and wiſh. And ſuch marriages, cannot be but happie, proſperous, & fortunate, becauſe God with his vnmeaſurable and excéeding goodneſſe doeth bleſſe, fauour, and as it were with this vaile and couer of wedlocke doeth hide, kéepe ſecrete, defende and alay this excéeding heat and ſeruencie of luſt, and alſo the holie ſcriptures doeth approue, and for example bringeth foorth the loue and voice of the Bride: after this maner doth God not only pardon our filthineſſe and miſerable luſt wherein wée were conceiued and borne, but alſo adorne and make vs more honourable, by and through lawfull matrimony.

               What is your counſell I pray you? If after the affiances and ſpouſalles once done, they proceede to their nuptiall day & act of generation againſt

the will and conſent of their Parentes.

               This we ought to knowe and vnderſtand, that after ſuch commixion and coupling of them ſelues together, they may not be ſeuered, nor diſioyned, neither may ſuch marriages be broken by the authoritie of their Parents: for becauſe there is now no queſtion of any marriage to come, and the authoritie of Parentes is alreadie violated and corrupted, ſo that great iniurie ſhoulde be offered vnto the woman, if ſhee ſhould be caſt off againe and forſaken. And to conclude, I will adde this one thing, that it doeth appertaine as wel to the duetie of Parents, as of Iudges, for they ought to weigh and conſider, where, and in what caſes the fathers may haue a probable cauſe to breake the marriage, and where not, which cauſes I will leaue to be diſcided, of the Diuines, and ſuch as haue to deale in thoſe nuptiall affaires.
