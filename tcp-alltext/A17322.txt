so poore, and simple meditations: that vnder the shadow of their fauourable acceptaunce they might finde some rest, and reliefe, and when I thought of your Hh. I set downe my rest, boldly presuming, yea fully assuring my self, that this small testimonie of dutie (whatsoeuer it be) should be no lesse acceptable thē my selfe haue bene alwayes welcome vnto you, & to your whole houshold. And indeede my good Lord, they doe belong vnto your Hh. in many respectes.
            First, in regard of those manifold fauours and honorable, kindnesses, which I haue alwayes (although vndeserued) founde at your Lordships hands. Secondly, when I was as a dry roote remoued, and vnlikely to finde a place to grow in, your Lordship did receiue me, and (vnder God) a was speciall meanes to preserue me frō such stormes and tempestes as did then threatē to annoy me. Further, by your Lordshippes good meanes a way was made, & a place was prouided, that I might exercise my talēt to the gaine of the Church. At my departure, your Lordship also furnished me with bookes out of your Librarie, & with other helpes, more then euer I looked for, or deserued: and in all these, your onely

care and desire was of my good, & the good of Gods Church. Reason therfore requireth, that your Lordship should once in 2. yeares space take a tast, at the least, of some of that frute, which (through the blessing of God) the soile of your Lordships fauor & kindnes, hath yeelded. But principally in regard of the matter it selfe, this treatise (If it be worthie of such a name) belōgeth to both your Hh. and to your whole houshold, whose chief delight with your Hh. was alwayes (during my abode in your Lordships house) in the holy exercises of religion & pietie. And I doubt not but that your Hh. godly zeale, and Christian care that way is still as great as euer, if not much greater then euer it was.
            As for the matter subiect of this treatise (I meane the assurance of Gods fauor, and such things as belong vnto the same) I am perswaded, it is so heauenly, and comfortable in it self, that nothing can be vnto your Hh. more deare and precious, then to be conuersant in the same: for I know you are already perswaded therof, and sufficiently confirmed therin: yet as the Disciples said (when the Lord Iesus shewed what a happy thing it is to eate bread in the kingdome of heauen) Lord giue vs euermore

of that bread (the very hearing therof did so please them.) Euen so your Hh. hauing heard, and felt in your soules, how blessed a thing it is to be assured of Gods fauor to eternall life, you will say, let vs still heare of that matter. For all things sauing this, do in time cōsume & become tedious: but this is of that nature, that the more is spent of it, the more it increaseth, like the widowes oyle, and the longer it is fed vpon, the sweeter it is vnto the soules of the faithful, like the water which Christ turned into wine, that who so euer drinketh thereof, may say as his mother said, (when all seemed to be gone) Lord thou hast kept the better vntill now, and the best is yet to come. If it shall please your Hh. to vouchsafe the perusing herof, and to measure the commendation therof vnto the glory of God, but by the liking and feeling of your own hearts, I haue what I desire, and my paines are more then sufficiently recompenced. Thus humbly crauing pardon for my boldnes, I commend both your Hh and it, to the gracious blessing of the most high.

            TO HIS BELOVED AND Christian auditours in the Citie of Bristoll grace, mercy, and peace.
            
               FOr your sakes in generall (beloued in the Lord Iesus) I haue aduentured to lay my selfe open in these my poore endeuours, to the view and censure of all the world. For your comfort, I first spake them, and for your profit I haue now penned them, that if any thing were at the first mistaken, and not well vnderstood, or since that, hath bene forgotten, and as yet is vnpractised, you might now learne it better, remember it longer, & practise it euer, to your endles cōfort. But that which hath chiefly preuailed with me for the publishing hereof, is the earnest desire of many, and special entreatie of some poore Christiās, afflicted in conscience, which came vnto me since, with their imperfect notes of their owne gathering, which I tooke as certaine pledges of some comfort already receaued, and argumēts of a holy desire to be further profited therby. Whose Christian desire, and godly hunger I take in this case as a sufficient calling hereunto, neither do I yet see how I could well haue made them a deniall, without some preiudice to their soules, some aduantage to the enemie, and some checke vnto my owne cōscience. For the matter it selfe: I cōfesse, it is of that Maiestie, and excellencie, that it requireth both large and deepe discourses, wherein many both learned & godly haue not bene wanting. My care hath bene to be found and plaine, for the benefite especially of the

simpler sort. And as the woman in the Gospel thought her selfe happy if she might but touch the hem of Christes garmēt, so when I began to meditate vpō the assurance of Gods loue, it seemed to be so excellent a point and so full of comfort, that I thought my selfe a happy man if I might but touch the points, & borders thereof, seeing I could not attaine to the full hādling therof. If any ignorant may be instructed in the truth, if any hereby may in time be conuerted to the loue of the truth, if any that is cōuerted, may by this meanes be confirmed in the truth, giue God the glory, and I hold my trauaile sufficiently recōpensed, neither shall it repent me to haue passed through good report, and bad report, through honor and dishonor, & the censures of all, so that any profite may redound to your soules, and all the glory may returne vnto God. That God which in his rich mercy hath first planted, and now watered it, cōtinue his good blessing vpon it, that it may become fruifull in vs, and we in it may grow vp as trees planted by the riuers of Gods loue & fauor, to bring forth fruit in due season, thē shall not our leaue

                     Psal. 41.11.12.13.
                  By this I know that thou fauourest me, because my enemy doth not triumph against me. 12. And as for me thou vpholdest me in mine integritie, and doest set me before thy face for euer. 31. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, without end. So be it, euen so be it.
               
            
            
               COncerning the author of this Psalme, it was the Prophet Dauid, who was both moued thereunto, and guided therein by the holy Ghost: and therfore we néed not doubt to receiue the doctrine thereof,
                  Iohn. 
                  
                     ••
                  .13. because he which is the spirite of truth neuer

led any but to the truth.
            The time when he made it, was (as it séemeth in ye 9. verse) whē 
               Absalom (aspiring to the kingdome) like a monster in nature, sought (by the wicked counsell of that faithlesse counseller & fained friend Achitophel) to pull from his owne father the crowne vpon his head,2. Sam. 16.21. to lay his honour in the dust, and his life in the graue. No small tēptation, either to blaspheme, or to dispaire, & yet he did neither of both: because God kept him from both: but then, euē in that hard time of winter (as we may call it) bethought with him selfe how he might make his affliction an occasion of further profit to himselfe and the whole Church of God, whereby it appeareth that no affliction is able to quaile the spirite of God in the godly, but as oyle maketh the fire to flame out, which before did but onely burne,2. Cor. 4.16. so with the godly, when the outward man doth perish the inward man is renued, and their afflictions doe make the spirite to flame out of thē to the good of others, which before did but burne within them to their owne comfort.
            Now for the matter of the Psalme. In generall he sheweth. 1. How great his afflictiō
               
was. 2. How greatly he profited by it. But more particularly, he recordeth. 1. The blessed estate of such as did wisely consider of his distressed estate, verses. 1.2.3. 2. He sheweth ye cause of his affliction to be his sinne. ver. 4.3. He setteth downe the greatnesse of his affliction, and the daunger that he stoode i
                  •
               , for his enemies looked euery day for his death and destruction.
            And of those his enemies he nameth thrée sortes. The. 1. sort were flatterers, of whom he complaineth and saith that they would come to sée him, but they would speake lyes, horde vp wickednesse in their hart, as in a vessell, and when they could get fit oportunitie they would emptie it vpon him. vers. 6. The 2. sorte were malitious whisperers, which did nothing but priuily contriue his ouerthrow, of whom he complaineth in the 7. & 8. verses thus. All that hate me whisper together against me, euen against me do they▪ imagine my hurt. A mischief is light vpon him, and he that is downe shall no more arise: The 3. sort were a more trecherous brood, who while they pretended kindnesse intended his subuersion, like Iudas, who couered his treason with a kisse. Of these traitero
                  •
               s

companions he complaineth in the 9. verse after this manner. Yea my familiar frend whom I trusted, which did eate of my bread, hath lifted vp the heele against me.
            
            And therefore being thus beset with open enemies on one side, with flattering clawbackes on the other side, with whisperers behinde, & traitors before his daunger must needes be great, and his case (in mans sight) very desperate.4. 4. He sheweth what meanes he vsed to preuent them all, and that was prayer to God, as appeareth in the 10. verse. Therefore O lord, raise me vp, so shall I reward them.
            
            But least Sathan might perswade him to doubt of Gods fauour towardes him in his affliction, as he would haue done with Iob in his temptation, and so make him either cold in prayer, or distrufull in prayer, that so he might also haue lost the fruite of his prayer, therefore in the 5. place,5. he proueth by two arguments yt all this notwithstanding, God doth still fauour him. The 1. is drawē frō his enemies person in the 11. verse. The 2. is taken from the consideration of his owne person in the 12. verse.6. Last of all, because God had geuen him such tokens of his loue, therfore

he concludeth his Psalme with thankesgeuing vnto God in this sort, Blessed be the Lord God of Israell, world without end. &c.
            
            This Psalme was left vnto the Church of God, & doth teach vs. 1. To take héede how we do rashly cōdemne those that be in trouble, and affliction, and are beset with diuers sorts of enemies, but wisely to consider, and charitably to iudge of their cause, if we looke for the Lordes helpe when we are in trouble our selues, and not to measure Gods fauour by outward prosperitie, nor his anger by outward aduersitie, as blind worldlings commonly vse to do. 2. That the vse of affliction is to worke in vs repentaunce for our sinnes, & to make vs flye to Gods mercy for succour, as Dauid did. 3. That Gods childrē while they liue, shall liue in daūger of open enemies, of malitious whisperers, and false brethren, though they be as godly as Dauid was. 4. That if we thē go to God by prayer, we shall preuent all our enemies, if they were as many as Dauids were. 5. That in our prayers we must be assured of Gods loue in Christ to vs ward, least otherwise we loose the fruite of our prayer. 6. That when God hath heard vs we must with hartie consent

prayse vnto him for it as Dauid did. So much of ye Psal. in generall, now to the text.
            
               By this I know. &c. In this text we sée two things. 1. How Dauid assureth himselfe of Gods loue towardes him. 2. How thankefull he is to God for assuring him of his loue. The .1. he doth by two arguments. One takē frō his enemies, they were preuēted of their expectation, therefore thou louest me. The other is taken from his owne estate, which was no whit hurt, or impaired, but bettered by them. In his thankesgiuing we may note two things. 1. To whom he giueth thankes, namely, to the Lord God of Israell. 2. In what manner he geueth thankes: with doubling of his speach, in tokē of his harty & vnfained cōsent to that which he spake, & as one afrayed that it was not wel inough, when it was at the best, he saith. So be it, euen so be it▪
                So much for ye methode now to the matter.
            
               By this I know that thou fauorest me. &c.
               First here, the Prophet speaketh of his knowledge, and telleth vs that though he knew not all things, yet he knew that God loued him, and so long as he knoweth that, he passeth not greatly for other matters, how

the world goeth with him. &c. And to say the truth he néede not, for he that is sure of that, is sure of all. God loueth all his creatures as a good God, and hateth nothing that he made, but he loueth his elect children with a more special loue then ye rest, as a father in Christ Iesus, & he that is sure that God doth so fauour him, is sure I say of al. For to him whō God loueth, he wil denie no good thing, no, not his owne sonne, and if he gaue vs his sonne because he loued vs,
                     Iohn. 3.16 Rom. 8.32 how shall he not with him giue vs all things els?
               When the child is perswaded that his father loueth him, he is bold to aske this & that of his father: so may we be bold to aske any thing of God our heauēly father that is good for vs, when we be sure that he loueth vs. As Mary and Martha put Christ in minde but of two things, the first was that Christ loued their brother Lazarus, the second was that Lazarus was sicke,
                     Iohn. 11.3 
                  He whō thou louest is sicke, it was no néede to tell him what he should do, for they knew he would do what might be done for him, because he loued him. So we may say to the Lord, when we are sure that he loueth vs, Lord he whō thou louest wanteth this or that for his body or

his soule, we néede not then appoint him what to do, or whē, or how, for looke what he séeth most conuenient for vs, & for his owne glory, he wil surely do it. Therfore whatsoeuer Dauid knoweth, he will be sure to know this: & whatsoeuer he be ignoraūt of, yet of this he will not be ignoraūt. To teach vs, yt whatsoeuer we séeke to make sure, this must first be made sure, or els nothing is sure. Peter bids vs make our election sure. Iob when he saith, I am sure that my redeemer liueth, teacheth vs to make our redēption sure. And here Dauid teacheth vs to make Gods fauour sure: now if we make that sure, thē our election is sure, our redemption is sure, our vocatiō is sure, and our saluation is sure.
               The suter desireth but the fauour of his beloued, what doth the child desire of his father, but fauour? what doth the subiect séeke for of his Prince but fauour? as Hester desired nothing but that the king would hold out his golden scepter to her in token of fauour: what doth the prisoner craue but fauour? And all these thinke thē selues in good estate if they may know that they be in fauour. And shall not we thinke our selues sure, whē we are sure that God doth fauour

vs, whose loue is aboue the loue of Princes, aboue the loue of fathers and mothers, yea aboue all loues? Yea no doubt of it, for if we make that sure, then our Prince is sure, our kingdome is sure, our Cities are sure, our bodies are sure, our soules are sure, and all is sure, for who dare hurt, or who can touch him whom God fauoreth? they touch the very aple of his eye. Shall we labour, and trauaile to be sure of loue, which is mutable, & not of that loue which is vnchaungeable? mans loue is mixt with hatred, and is commonly more like hatred then loue, but Gods loue is perfect without any mixture: whom men fauour,
                     Rom. 11.29. they fauour for a while, but whom God loueth he loueth to the end, euen for euer. Shal we then séeke for the scraps, & let the feast go? shall we go the crickes, whē we may go to the sea? nay to filthy puddles, when pure fountaines are by? so we may soone proue as wise as Esaw, that chaunged his birth right for right naught, nay so we proue as foolish as Iudas, that valued ye goodwill of the Iewes aboue the loue of Christ, but he gat nothing by it, by that time he and the gallowes had reckned together. Dauid makes more accompt of Gods fauour then

of his kingdome, yea then of victorie against his enemies, as if he should say, my foes do not triumph against me, that is well for me, but by this I know that thou louest me, that is better.
               We haue markes to know euery thing by, sauing the loue of God, but of that we thinke we are sure, for we thinke so well of our selues that God must néedes loue vs whether we will or no, as yt Papistes which set their good workes vpon the score, & make God indebted to them for their workes, and therefore we regard neither the time when, nor the place where, nor the persons by whō, nor the tokens by which the Lord doth offer to make his loue knowen vnto vs.
               When the seruaūts of Benhadad king of Aram, went with ropes about their neckes to Achab king of Israel, to entreat for their maisters life, they gaue diligēt héede if they could catch any thing of Achabs mouth that might be a signe of fauour,1. King. 20 33. and when they heard him call Benhadad his brother, oh how glad were they? How did they play vpon that word? how did they féede their hope vpon it? they made hast and said, Thy brother liueth. The Lord hath greater aduantage

against vs thē euer Achab had against Benhadad, for he did flye from Achab, so can not we from the Lord, he did hide himselfe from Achab, so can not we from the Lord, Bēhadad had seruāts to send to king Achab, but what spokesmen shall we send to the Lord? we must come forth our selues. Achab had power but against the body of Benhadad, the Lord hath power against both our bodies and soules, king Achabs power was subiect to the Lordes power, but who shall withstand the Lordes power, for his counsel shall stand? If Achab had exercised his power vpō 
                  Benhadad it had bene but for a time, but if the Lord should execute his wrath vpon vs, if it were kindled yea but litle, it would flame for euer, now if we did consider these things well, & if we were asmuch afrayde of the king of heauen, as they were of the king of Israell, and if our miserable daungers, and daungerous miseries did as nearely touch vs, as theirs did touch them, we would take as diligent héede to ye words of God as they did to the wordes of king Achab, and we would be as glad to heare a word that might be as a token of fauour, as they were, but alas we do not consider, we

are not touched, nor moued, & therfore when ye Lord doth by his messengers entreat vs to be saued, & wooe vs by all the names & tokēs of loue, we regarde not, the Lord open our eyes to see in what a desperate case we stand and let vs make more reckening of Gods loue tokens then we do, if not, shall not the Aramites rise vp in iudgement against vs?
               When the Angell came downe to stirre vp the poolé of Bethesda, (wherein lay many sicke and diseased) there was wayting on euery side,
                     Iohn. 5.2.3 4.5. and happy was he that could step in first, for he that stept in first after the stirring of the water was healed, of what disease soeuer he had. We haue a better poole thē the poole of Bethesda, for the word of God is water of life, and able to cleanse the soule & body too, if we step into it whē it is stirred by the Angell of the Lord, how often hath ye Lord by his Ministers, stirred vp this water, that we might be healed by it? no small fauour no doubt. But who waiteth for it? who steppeth into it? Nay who steppeth not from it rather? who is cleansed by it? and yet who hath not néede of it? For none cā say his hart is cleane. Now if we make no more reckoning of Gods loue, and his loue tokens then

thus, shall not those sicke and diseased men of Bethesda rise vp in iudgement against vs? no doubt they shall.
               We thinke that whatsoeuer we want, yet we are sure that God doth loue vs, & neuer make any reckoning of his loue tokens, but we may be deceiued. Dauid was not alwayes so sure, for sometime he thought that the Lord had forgotten him, sometime he thought that God had geuē him ouer to him selfe, hereupon he cried out at one time,
                     Psal. 89.46 Psal. 51.11.12. 
                  how long shall thy wrath burne like fire? for euer? at another time he prayeth, O take not thy spirite from me, restore vnto me the ioy of my saluation, by which pitifull cries it may appeare that he was halfe afrayde. Therefore he was glad to take a loue token when it was offred him, for when he was not sure of Gods loue towardes him, he thought that God was angry with him, and that was of all things most terrible vnto him and intollerable. So must we, if we wilbe sure that God is not angry with vs, we must be sure that he fauoureth vs.
               If Gods people must be sure of Gods fauour towards them in Christ, as Dauid teacheth, then we must not stand in doubt of it

as Papists do teach, we haue no reason so to do. For doth he call vs his sonnes, and we call him our father, that we should doubt of his loue? Doth he call vs his friends, his brethren, his spouse, his loue, his doue, and by all the names of loue, that we should doubt of his loue? Hath he kissed vs with so many kisses of his mouth? hath he sent vs so many pledges of his loue? hath he renewed his couenant so often? hath he sealed it with the Sacraments, and bound it with an oth? and al this that we might doubt whether he doth loue vs or no? Thus you sée one point of poperie ready to soune at the hearing of this doctrine. If there be any Papist here that hath a mind to it, let him take it vp, & make much of it, for Gods people (you sée) care not for it, they had rather know for a certaintie that God doth fauour them, then to stand in doubt thereof.
               To loue God, and to be loued of God, is all that God requireth of vs, and all that we desire of God. For if we loue him, then we feare him, we worship him, we trust in him, we heare him, we obey him, &c. If he loue vs, then he prouideth for vs all good things, and preserueth vs from all that may hurt vs, &c.

Our loue to him hath marks, and so hath his to vs. God doth not loue vs and kéepe it from vs, but he maketh it knowen that he loueth vs, as Ionathan made his loue knowen to Dauid, and as the father of the prodigal child made his loue manifest to his sonne when his affection was towards him.
            
            
               By this I know that thou fauorest me (saith Dauid) because mine enemie hath 
                     •
                  ot triumphed against me.
               When God doth deliuer vs from the hāds of our enemies, or any trouble else, we may perswade our selues thereby, that he hath a fauour vnto vs, as Dauid did.
               But then it may be demaunded, If God doth loue his Church, why doth he suffer his Church to be troubled and molested with enemies? The reason is this, because by this meanes his loue may be made more manifest, in sauing and deliuering them. For as a sure friend is not knowen but in time of néede: so Gods goodnesse and loue is neuer so well perceiued, as it is in helping of vs whē we cannot helpe our selues. As Adams fall did serue to manifest Gods iustice & mercie,
                     Rom. 9.22 23. the one in punishing, the other in pardoning

of sinne, which otherwise we had neuer knowne: so the troubles of the Church serue to manifest 1. our desertes by reason of our sinnes. 2. our weakenes and inabilitie to helpe our selues, and 3. the louing kindnes of the Lord our God, in sauing and defending, that so we might be truly thankfull, & returne all the praise and glorie to God, and none to our selues. So that the Church of God may haue enemies, and yet be still the beloued of God, as Lazarus was beloued of Christ although he was sicke: for whom the Lord loueth he correcteth, and therefore he correctech them, because he loueth them.

               If this be not sufficient▪ he can proue it by an example of the Israelites, of whom he maketh this report. They lusted with concupiscence in the wildernesse, meaning, whē they desired the flesh pots of Egypt againe.
                     Psal. 106. 
                  And (saith he) The Lord gaue them their desire [for he sent them quayles] but he sent14. leannesse into their soules [for he cursed it,15. & it did them no good,16. but they dyed with the meate in their mouthes] & what became of17. the rest that had their desire,

                  they rebelled against Moses & Aaron, whereupon ye earth

swallowed vp some, and fire from heauen deuoured other some. If you aske the Prophet Esay, he will auouch this to be true, for (speaking in the person of God to the stubburne Iewes) he saith thus,

               It is no new thing you sée, for good men to haue enemies, nay the better men the more enemies,
                     Luk. 22.32 as Peter the more faithfull to Christ the more sifted by Sathan, but as Christ then prayed for Peter, that his faith might not fayle, so he prayeth still for the faithfull that their faith may not fayle, so that still they may say with Dauid. By this I know that thou louest me, because my enemies do not triumph against me.
               
               But what? did not Dauids enemies triūph against him when they said, A mischief is 
                        •
                     ight vpon him, and he that lyeth shall rise no more. As appeareth in the 8. verse of this Psalme. Why did Dauid then so gréeuously complaine? The aunswere is at hand, they spake euill indéede of Dauid, and as they would haue had it, yea, and as they thought to haue had it too, but the Lord deliuered him, so that they triumphed before the victorie. When they saw that the Lord did a litle visite him, they cried out: now he is met withall, now he is downe. &c. And thus rashly

they iudged of the Lordes annointed, and triumphed ouer him, whom the Lord raised vp again▪ So played the Popes Catholikes, when they would haue come vpon vs, like the fat Bulles of Basan, gaping vpon vs, as though they would haue eaten vs vp, when they saw some of our men ouercome in battaile, or when the Lord did a litle frowne vpon vs, they began straightway to triumph ouer vs, & marching into Irelād, as though all had bene cocke sure for thē: but ye Lord put a bridle into their mouthes, & so caried thē backe again by Senacheribs way. So likewise before they came last with their inuincible Nauy, they deuided our kingdome, and prouided owners for euery country, Citie, Bishopricke, Lordship, and whippes for euery body. Indéede they troubled vs, & put many in great feare, but through Gods goodnesse the feare was greater then the hurt, by which the Lord would geue vs to vnderstād, that he had a fauour towardes vs. And that we might know it indeede, he would not suffer vs to destroy them, least we should say that through our owne power we gaue thē the ouerthrow, and gat our selues the victorie, but with his owne hand, and with his holy

arme he gat himselfe the victorie, that the whole prayse might returne to himself, & by this we might be assured of his loue, and fauour towardes vs, blessed be his name for it. Surely this was one of the greatest loue tokens that euer he bestowed vpon vs (of tē
                  porall benefites) the greatnesse whereof shal appeare, when we consider how they would haue handled vs, if they had triumphed against vs. For this purpose let vs take but a litle view. First of their exactiōs in Naples, secondly of their sauage cruelties vpon the poore Indians, and thē shall we sée what miseries and mischiefs such a triumph and such triumphers would haue brought vpon vs. And first of their exactions in Naples, when they triumphed there. To passe ouer their trecherous entraunce, it is reported by one of their owne Bishops (in a booke that he wrote to the king of Spaine,
                     Exactions of Spaniardes in Naples.
                   for the redresse of these things) yt euery foure or fiue yeares they receiued 200000. or 400000. and a Million of gold. Their landed men were defeated of their landes and houses, if they had not their euidence to shew (which perhaps might be lost) although they could make iust proofe of their lawfull possessiō and right for

a 100. yeares before. The farmer of their butcherie, and powltrie receiueth 300. Duckets daily for his fee Euery chimney payeth 6.

                  . what should I say? if all the payments were layed together, that all the kings had before, they were not comparable to the extraordinarie exactions of the Spaniards in Naples.
               As for their cruelties on the poore Indiās they are not to be spokē, for they dispeopled more then 10. Realmes greater then all Spaine, Aragō and Portugall. Within 40. yeares they butchered aboue 12. Millions of men,
                     The crueltie of Spaniards in India.
                   women, and infants. They would set vp men and women naked against trées or walles. &c. and would lay wagers, who should shoote or throw their dartes nearest the hart, and made a sport of murther, as ordinarily as we do of shooting, or bowling &c. They would vse to broyle men to death vpon gridirons, especially great men: whereupon it fell out, that certaine Lordes being broyled, foure or fiue, through their pitifull roaring and crying (which they were enforced to make through extremitie of torment) disquieted ye Captaine that lay not far of, & to make them hold their peace they had their

mouthes stopped with bullets, vntill they were rosted to death. Their cruelties were so great that a certaine Lord, for feare fled to the Ile of Cuba, where he was taken and burned, and being exhorted by a Frier to dye a Catholique, that he might go to heauen, he asked the Frier whither the Spaniards wēt when they dyed, to heauen quoth the Frier. Then I will not goe to heauen said the Indian Lord, because the Spaniardes (as you say) goe thither, for it is better to go to hell (said he) thē to come where any Spaniards haue any thing to do.
               Another time, a certaine Spanish gouernour entring the firme land, a Lord of the countrey to gaine his goodwill, and to auoid torture, met him, and presented him with nine thousand duckets, in recompēce wherof they bound him to a stake, and set fire to his féete, whereupon he brought thrée thousand Castillans more, with which summe this tyrant not satisfied, put fire againe to his féet, vntill the sinewes burst, and the marrowe sprung out of the bones, and so he died. The king of Mexico sent a thousand presents to welcome him, besides that: him selfe in his owne person met him with an honourable

               The same tyrant going to warre against any Citie, or prouince, would yoke many together by the neckes, allowing no sustenāce to twentie thousand, but the flesh of so many Indians as they could kill. They had as ordinarie a shambles of mans flesh as we haue of beasts:

Another, hunting venison, could find no game, and comming homward he met a woman with a child in her armes, he tooke her infant, and cut it in péeces, and threw it to his dogges for liuerie.

                  ast we may giue a gesse how our cup should haue bene tempered, if the Lord had suffered them to triumph ouer vs, for if they handled these poore soules after this maner, which neuer did hurt them, nor their religion, how wold they haue handled vs, which alwayes haue bene enemies to their irreligious procéedings? surely their hatred against vs, would haue proued like Nebuchadnezzars fornace,
                     Dan. 3.19. seuen times hotter then it was before: yea they would haue sent vs Rehoboams message, and his measure, vz. that their litle finger should haue bene greater vpon vs then their loines were vpon them.
                  1. King. 12.10.11. And whereas they did burthen them with a grieuous yoke, they would haue made our yoke heauier: and whereas they chastised them with rods, they would haue corrected vs with scorpions, if they had triumphed ouer vs as they made full accompt. By this then we may know that the Lord loueth vs, (alas a nation not worthie to be loued) because our enemies did not triumph

against vs. Blessed be his name for euer.
               But doth God loue none but those whom he deliuereth out of their enemies handes? Yes surely, that he doth: for it is no matter how we be ouercome of our bodily enimies, so that our spirituall enemies do not ouercome vs. For euerie Christian hath two sorts of enemies as Dauid had, bodily, and spirituall: our spirituall enemies be our sinnes, and the temptations of the world, the flesh and the deuill which fight against the soule (as S. Peter saith).1. Pet. 2.11 Now these do often trouble the children of God, rebelling against them,
                     Rom. 7.23 and many times leading thē captiues to the law of sinne, yet finally they do not triumph against them, because they do not willingly yéeld them selues to sinne, with delight in sinne, as the wicked do: but they do cōtinually striue against them by earnest prayer vnto God, by hearing the word of God,
                     Rom. 8.37 and by faith in Iesus Christ, they are made more then conquerours in the end, as S. Paule teacheth in his doctrine to the Rom.
               
                  By this I knowe that thou fauourest me. &c. Without doubt the Prophet Dauid had néede of many blessings moe, which the Lord did not bestow vpō him, but kept them back

from him, and all to humble him: and yet he did not murmure against God, for the want of them, but gaue him thanks for those which he had alreadie receiued. Although the Lord did not suffer him to take any rest, because of his enemies, yet he praiseth God, because they did not triumph against him, a good lesson for vs to learne. Whē ye Lord shal afflict vs with any maner of affliction: as, losse of goods, losse of friends, losse of health, or whatsoeuer else, we should remēber then what benefites we haue still, which we are vnworthie of. Then thus may Gods childrē say to God: Though the Papists do molest vs, and speake all euill of vs, though our enemies séeke and sift vs, yet they misse of their purpose, and thou doest raise vp friends vnto vs. Though Athiests, scoffers, & worldly beasts do

                  est, and more then he doth for euerie one. So we may say for matters

of reformation, although euery thing be not in all respectes as it should be, and as if were to be wished, yet let vs thāke the Lord for these good things we haue. Though the growth of the Church be yet hindred by many ignoraunt Ministers and idle nonresidents, yet hath the Church many good Pastours, and teachers to whom the porter Iesus Christ hath opened the doore, and furnished with singular graces, for the good of his Church. Let vs thanke his Maiestie for them, and not as some do, which for the want of some things, condemne all the things which we haue, because the Church (forsooth) is not so purely purged as it ought to be, therefore we haue no Church no Ministers, no Sacraments. &c. as it please our schismatiques to affirme, and therefore in a ma

                  : is this to shew our selues thākefull for that we haue receaued? shall we acknowledge nothing good, because

all is not perfect? we ought to striue orderly, and lawfully (I confesse) vnto perfection if it may be, that Zion may shine in perfect beautie. But in ye meane while let vs feare, that the Lord for our vnthankefulnesse, and scornefull contempt will take away those good things which we haue, before he giue vs any more. If we should want nothing, we should waxe wātō, & forget the Lord, as Dauid did,
                     Psal. 30.6. who thought whē God had made him strong, he should neuer be moued, and therefore to humble vs, and kéepe vs vnder, the Lord still kéepeth somewhat from vs.
               But now let vs sée what vse we may make of all yt hath bene said: we haue heard that ye Lord doth not onely loue vs, but also that he maketh his loue knowen vnto vs, by sauing vs from the cruell hands of our enemies: this is no small matter, for the Lord to bestow such loue vpon his enemies, which deserue nothing but his hatred and heauie displeasure, should not this make vs loue the Lord againe? That we do, will euery one be ready to say,

                     Ioh. 21.15If you loue me (saith Christ to Peter) feede my flocke, to shew, that if Ministers féede not ye flocke of Christ, with the foode of their soules, the liuely preaching of the word, they loue not Christ: and yet both ignoraunt Ministers, negligent Pastors, & carelesse non-residents, will beare men in hand they loue▪ God, O cruell loue that suffreth mēs soules to sinke downe to hell with their owne, for whō the Lord Iesus hath shed his bloud. You Magistrats will say you loue God, if you do so indéede, let it appeare in coūtenaūcing his word when it is preached, and encouraging

his Ministers, in reforming his Sabboth, in suppressing of lewdnesse, in vpholding of goodnesse, and iudging iustly, which if you do not, by this you may be sure you loue not God.
                     Ioh. 13.34. If you loue me, saith Christ, loue one another, to teach vs, that if we loue not one another professing all the same Gospell, w
                     •
                   loue not Christ, for he yt loueth him which begat, loueth him also which is begottē,1. Ioh. 5.1. and he that loueth the head, must néedes loue the mēbers. Now if we delight still in quarrelling, and contending one with another, in censuring, and iudging one of an other for toyes and trifles, in spiting, and vexing, in mistaking, and misconstruing, in racking and rending, of wordes and halfe wordes, if we continue still in bitternesse and wrath, in mallice an enuie, and will not be contēt to be curteous and louing, and in the bowels of tender cōpassion fréely to forgeue as God for Christ his sake forgaue vs,
                     Ephe. 4.31.32. we may be sure we loue not God. Againe, if you loue me (saith Christ) doe good to the poore, which you shall alwayes haue with you, and looke what you do to them, I will take it as if it were done to my selfe: now if we be so straight laced against the poore, as we haue

bene, and do not exercise the workes of mercy towardes them, according to our abilitie, how can we say that we loue God? I meane not to be a proctour for the idle, and slouthfull, which can worke and will not, for they ought not to eate, and in Gods name let thē be driuen to worke or be seuerely punished: for if you shall maintaine such: when time shall serue, they will cut your throats for that you haue, to make you amends, like Hanun who cruelly,2. Sam. 10.4. and shamefully entreated Dauids messengers, when of curtesie, and goodwill, they were sent to visite him, but reléeue while you may those that are impotent, aged, sickly, diseased, and labour hard for their liuing, & would worke if they had it, sée to such I beséech you on Christs behalf, and encourage the vertuous and godly amongst you, you vse to say, God helpe you, I haue not for you, a cold almes God knoweth, but if God had suffred our enemies to triumph ouer vs, thē we should haue said: God helpe vs, we haue neither for you, nor for our selues, therefore while you haue wealth and are able, doe good withall, do not be-lye the Lord that hath giuen you both for your selues, & for them too, for in such time you may

speake it, that your wordes may proue truer then you wot of▪ as it did with Ananias & his wife,
                     Actes. 5.3. who said they had no more left, when they had as much more as they sold. Furthermore, if we be assured that ye Lord doth loue vs in Iesus Christ, we may be bold to pray without feare, and not doubting that he will heare vs.
               Last of all this assurance of Gods fauour, should bréed in vs a resolution to leaue all our odd shifts, and deuises which we vse to liue by, and to rely wholy vpon his prouidence, vsing no meanes but good, knowing that he which loueth vs, will not see vs want any thing that he séeth good for vs. These things may trouble vs, but if they do not triumph ouer vs, by ouerruling vs, thē we are beloued of God: striue we then by faith and repentaunce against our affections, and in the end we shall surely triumph in heauen, for the Church can not be triumphant in heauen, vntill it be militant on earth: Now let vs pray.
               
            
         
         
            
            THE SECOND SERMON OF THE ASSVRAVNCE OF GODS LOVE Nouember. 21. Sabboth day.
            
               By this I know that thou fauorest me. &c.
            
            
               THe Prophet Dauid careth not what enemies he hath nor how many he hath, so that God be not his enemy, he regardeth not what the Lord doth vnto him, neither how he doth handle him, so that he may be sure he doth it in his loue & fauour towardes him, and not in his wrath, and displeasure: therefore he prayeth,
                  Psal. 6.1. 
               Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thy displeasure, as if he should say, I care not, O Lord, what yu doest with me in this life, so that I may be sure of thy fauour and louing kindnesse.
            This serueth to teach vs, that when any trouble, or affliction shall come vpon vs, we

must not so much looke vpon that, and séeke to be eased thereof, as to looke whether we be in fauour with God or no. And being sure of his fauour in his sonne Iesus Christ, to arme our selues patiētly to beare the crosse whatsoeuer it be, because whatsoeuer it is, outward or inward, it is layed vpon vs in loue, not to hurt vs, but to helpe vs forward in the wayes of godlynesse. We will take any thing well at his handes, of whom we are perswaded that he loueth vs, for the assuraūce of his loue swalloweth vp, and swéetly sendeth downe all the rest: if he teach vs, we take it, if he admonish vs, we are contented, if he reproueth vs, we put it vp, if he iest with vs, we are not gréeued, yea, if he smite vs, we are not offended, all is taken in good part, because they come frō loue, who neuer did hurt his beloued. So God dealeth with vs, his children, he teacheth vs when we are ignoraunt, he correcteth vs when we goe astray, he admonisheth vs when we are vnruly, he reproueth vs when we transgresse, he threatneth vs when we are stubburne, and he smiteth vs when there is no remedy, but is his fauor and mercy he teacheth, correcteth, reproueth, threatneth, and smiteth

his children, that they might not be damned with the wicked world. If he woundeth vs, his fauour is oyle to cure the wounde, if he sendeth floudes, and seas of troubles, the assuraunce of his fauour is like Noahs Arke to beare vs vp from drowning. If his wrath shall burne like fire, his fauour is water to coole the heate: whereof Diues in hell could not get a drop: if he send sicknesse either of body or minde, the assuraunce of his fauour is a present remedy, like the brasen Serpēt: if he sendeth sorrow ouernight, his louing fauour shall bring ioy in the morning, and a ioyfull tidings like, Sonne be of good cheare thy sinnes are forgeuen thee. If he chide vs, his fauour that he beareth vnto vs, will not suffer him to chide for euer: if his wrath be kindled against his children▪ his fauour puts out all againe, if he sets vs vp as markes to be shot at, he sets his fauour before vs, with the assuraunce whereof, we are defended as with a shield.
                  Psal. 5.12.
            
            When he punisheth his childrē he pitieth them, for he doth not punish them as an enemy, but as a father, therefore Dauid saith, As a father hath compassion on his childrē,
               
                  Psal. 103.13. 
               so hath the Lord compassion on all those that

feare him. A fathers anger is rather loue then anger, and his correction is to be compted rather a loue token, then a punishment: So is Gods anger towardes his children which feare him, and keepe his couenaunts: and therefore his correction is a loue token and no punishment.
            Aske Salomon: and he will tell you so, nay the Lord himselfe will tell you so, if he sinne (saith the Lord) meaning by Salomon) I will chasten him with the rod of men,
               2. Sam. 7.19.15. 
               and with the plagues of the children of men, but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I tooke it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. Aske Adam and Eue and they will tell you so, for in punishing their first sinne, he wrapped vp a blessing within the curse, saying to the Serpent,
                  Gen. 3.15. 
               that the seede of the womā should breake his head, meaning that Christ should weaken the power of sinne & of death, such was his loue that he could scarce punish for loue. Aske Dauid and he will tell you so. The Lord hath chastened me sore (saith he) (belike then he was very angry) but he hath not deliuered me vnto death.
               
                  Psal. 118.18. Therefore he made his choise to fall into Gods hands, rather then into mens

handes,2. Sam. 24.14. because (saith he) the Lord is mercifull in correcting. Who would not be contēt now to beare whatsoeuer in this life such a a God should lay vpon him? When Iesus wept ouer Lazarus, the Iewes said, behold, how he loued him,
               
                  Ioh. 11.35 yea though he suffred death to cast him into his graue the common bed of all flesh, yet behold how he loued him. So may Gods children say, when the Lord correcteth, or reproueth, or afflicteth thē, yet marke how he séeketh vs, entreateth vs, and wooeth vs, that when we sée this, we must néedes say, behold how he loueth vs. Sechem deferred not to doe all that was required of him,
                  Gen. 34.19. for the obtaining of Dinah, because he loued her. So when we stand in néede of the Lordes helpe, he deferreth not to helpe vs, because he loueth vs.
                  Iudg. 66.15. 
               Dallila said to Sampson, how canst thou say, that thou louest me, seeing that thy hart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times. But who can say that the Lord doth not loue his children, séeing both his hart and his hand is with thē, and he neuer mockt them? When the Lord doth crosse his people, he dealeth with them as Ioseph dealt with his brethren, which because it is so liuely a resemblaunce of the

Lordes procéeding with vs, we will a litle compare the one with the other: both for our comfort and also for our instruction. When Iosephs brethrē came to Egipt to buy corne, Ioseph knew them, and spake roughly vnto them,
               
                  Gen. 42.7. 
               and bare them in hand that they came as spies: so the Lord dealeth with his children many times, whē they come to him for such things as they want, He knoweth them wel inough: but maketh himselfe straunge vnto them, and speaketh roughly vnto them, by séeming to deny their request, yea somtimes by encreasing their sorrow and affliction, as Iacob striuing with the Angell for a blessing,
                  Gen. 32.24. to 30. receiued a blow on his thigh more then he looked for.
            Well, Ioseph turned from his brethren and wept, for he loued them, but he kept it secret to him selfe a while: so the Lord loueth his children, when he handleth them very roughly, but he kéepeth it sometime secret for a while. Further, it is sayd of Ioseph, that he tooke Simeon from them, and bound him before their eyes: now all this while Ioseph knew his brethren,
                  Vers. 8. but they knew not him: for if they had knowen it had bene their brother Ioseph which loued them,

no doubt they would haue borne any thing at his hands. So if we knew our troubles to come frō our Father which loueth vs, would we not willingly beare any thing at his hands to?36. Afterward Beniamin must go, thē 
               Iacob thought he had bene robbed of all his children, but he found Ioseph, Simeon and Beniamin, & all againe at the last. So Gods children in the end find all, when they thinke they haue lost all. Well, Beniamin goeth, and when he is come, Ioseph reasoneth the matter with them thus,
                  Chap. 43.29.30. 
               Is this your brother or whom you told me? &c. He knew it well inough, but before he could go any further, his affection was so inflamed towards his brother, that he made hast, & sought where to weepe: all this while he loued them dearly, but kept it to him selfe.
                  Chap. 44. After all this sée a secōd triall no whit inferior to the former: As they went home, hu and crie came after them for Iosephs cup, which was in pollicie conueyed into their brother Beniamins sack, search was made, they thought them selues cleare, so do we many times iustifie our selues: they did afterward cōdemne thēselues, and whē it was found in Beniamins sacke, they were worse apayed then they were before.

Wel Beniamin must stay by the reckening, and answer the matter, this passed all the rest: so doth the Lord many times finde out sinne by vs, when we thinke all is wel: and then things go worse and worse with vs (as we thinke): & yet still the feare is greater then the hurt. Well, hereupon Iudah draweth neare to Ioseph,
               
                  Vers, 18. and said, Let me speake but a word in the eares of my Lord, and tels him a long storie of the whole matter, from the beginning to the ending, as though Ioseph all this while had known nothing of the matter. So we oftentimes in the griefe of our hearts powre foorth manie things, & complaints which the Lord knoweth well enough.
                  Chap. 45.1.2. Now after many trialls, it is said that Ioseph could no longer refrain before all that stood by, but cried, Haue forth euerie man from me, which being done▪ he wept, and cryed, so that all heard him, both of the Egyptians & of Pharaohs house. And at the last his loue breakes foorth like the morning light, and ouerfloweth after long restraint, as a streame (whose course is stopped) ouerfloweth the banks. Now mark how he vttereth him selfe,3. 
               I am Ioseph (sayth he) is my father aliue? but his brethren could not

answer him, for they were astonished at his presence: full litle did they thinke that Ioseph had bene so neare them, they did not once dreame of any such matter, or of anie such man. Euen so the hand of God is many times in the tempring of afflictions to the godly for their good, when they thinke full litle vpon it.4. But againe (saith Ioseph) I am Ioseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt: (wel fare all good tokēs) come neare I pray you vnto me,
               5. 
               be not sad nor grieued with your selues that you sold me, for it was Gods doing for your preseruatiō. Afterward they and their father, and all his house came vp and had Egypt to inhabite: after the like maner deale
                  •
               h God with his children as Ioseph dealt with his brethren, but after many trials he vttereth him selfe vnto them, he puts them in good remembrance of their iniuries done to his Maiestie: he fréely forgiueth them, and giueth them the inheritance at 
                  •

                  •
               hey desired, and more then they looked for, by which they are assured of Gods fauor vnto them. Therefore who will not be content with patience to beare what triall soeuer this our louing God, and mercifull

Father shall thinke good to lay vpon him?
            Although Israell were hardly intreated of Egypt, yet God sayd,
                  Exo. 3.21. 
               I will get this people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that when ye go ye shal not go emptie. Now if the Israelites went not away emptie, whē they were in fauour with the Egyptians, much lesse shall we go away emptie frō the Lord if we be in fauour with him: for séeing he hath of his frée mercie, without any desert of ours, giuen vs his onely Sonne, how shall he not with him (saith S. Paule) giue vs all things else?
               
                  Rom. 8.32 Hereupon it came that the Martyrs were alwayes so 
                  •
               ocund and merrie, for they were neuer sent away empty from the barre, from the prison, from the stake, nor frō the fire, but still the Lord filled their hearts with ioy and gladnesse, and euer sustained their soules with the comfortable assurance of his fauour: and so fast as their persecutors condemned them, God iustified them, so fast as they stript them, their God clothed them: so fast as they tormented them their God did comfort them: whē 
               
                  •
               hey impo
               
                  •
               erished, God enriched: when they frowned, God smiled: when they spoiled the outward

man, God renewed the inward man: when they wounded, God healed: when they killed, God quickened: and finally when they reiected them, their God receiued them, wherby they were not onely assured that he loued them, but also were encouraged to beare whatsoeuer came for the assurance of Gods fauour, so deare and precious was it vnto them.
                  Prou. 22.1 Therefore Salomon saith that louing fauour is aboue gold and siluer: if the louing fauor of men be aboue gold & siluer, how shall we value the louing fauor of God? which being lost, the whole world and ten thousand worlds cannot redéeme, which being obtained, is better thē the whole world. And ten thousand worlds, with all the deuils in hel can neuer take it from Gods children, when they haue once the assurance therof in their hearts, sealed vp vnto them by the spirit of adoption. I say once againe, whereat, or at what price shall we value this fauour of our God?
            When Iob was assured of this louing fauour of God in the heate of his affliction, he was so far from shrinking, or sinking down vnder his burthen, that he said like a valiant souldier,
                  Iob. 13.15. 
               though he kill me, yet will I trust in

him. As if he should say, I loue my life well, but I loue Gods fauour better, to teach vs yt if we be assured of his louing fauour once, we care not what we suffer in this life for it, no more then Iob did, for he knew that Gods killing would proue a quickning. So that all our care and cunning (my beloued in the Lord) must be to sée the louing fauour of God in all our temptations, troubles, and afflictions.2. King. 9.20.22. And then: as Iehoram said to Ie
                  
                     •
                  u, when he marched in his furie, comest thou peaceably? as if he should say, if thou comest peaceably, march as furiously as thou wilt. So let vs say to our God, O Lord comest thou fauorably? and in loue against vs? thē come as terribly as thou wilt. Shoot thy arrowes, and spend them all vpon me, beate me to powder, take all away, and in this life do with me what thou wilt, so thou doest assure me of thy fauour. So we pray in that prayer, which is called the Lordes prayer. Thy will be done, but Lord forgiue vs our sinnes, and then doe what thou wilt, deliuer vs from euil, & from the deuill, and then tempt vs, or bring vs into what battailes it pleaseth thée. So reasoneth the Prophet Dauid likewise, Happy are they

whose oxen are strong to labour, happy are they which are frée from forraine inuasion, and ciuil dissention, which a bound with many outward, worldly, and generall benefits▪ &c. but how if we misse of these outward things?
                  Psal. 144. last.
                why then, happy is the people whose God is the Lord. So again, in another place he makes the very same reckening, Many (saith he) wil say,
               
                  Psal. 4.6.7. 
               who wil shew vs any good, that is, wordly goods, but Lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenaunce vpon vs. &c. to teach vs, that we must not care what we want so that we may be sure of Gods louing countenaunce in the Gospell of his sonne Iesus Christ.
                  Mat. 15.22 The woman of Chanaan was content to take many repulses at the hands of our Sauiour, so that she might be sure of one graunt: so let vs be content to take many repulses, so that we may be sure of Gods fauour in our repulses. The birth of ye child into the world, swalloweth vp all ye paines, and panges of the mother in forgetfulnesse, which went before the birth: so saith our Sauiour Christ. So we if after our manifold afflictiōs and sorrowes for Christes his sake, we bring forth the assuraunce of Gods fauour here, and of eternall life hereafter being

dead, let forgetfulnesse deuoure and cō
               sume all the rest. And séeing as the Lord in his louing fauour doth thus and thus crosse his children, let patience beare it, let forgetfulnesse weare it, and by this let vs learne to trust in our God another time without fainting, or shrinking when troubles come againe. The wicked blind world takes another course, they cast their eye altogether vpon the crosse, and studie how to be eased of that, with odd shiftings, and many vnlawfull deuises and vngodly practises, but because they sée not the louing fauour of God towards them in Christ Iesus, they are ready to sinke downe in dispaire of mercy, and horrour of conscience, like a lumpe of lead in the sea. The Lord in one hand hath fire to burne, & in his other hand water to quench, but he holdeth it behind his backe many times, that at the first it is not perceiued, no not of his deare children, but at the last they both sée it, and féele the comfort of it, and acknowledge the same, saying with Dauid, By this I know that thou fauorest me. &c. Therfore as the child is glad when his father smileth vpon him, and speakes comfortably vnto him, although he beates him, so let vs be

glad, & reioyce whē our heauēly father doth smile vpon vs, in giuing vs the assuraunce of his loue, although he doth afflict vs.
            
               By this I know that thou louest me, because mine enemies do not. &c.
               Here further we are to cōsider of the prouidēce, and wisedome of God, in that he turneth the rage and malice of our enemies t
                     •
                   our great good, for by this he assureth vs o
                        •
                      his fauour which is the greatest good that is Thus you sée that the enemies of Gods childrē do them good against their will, the Lord by his euer watching prouidence so disposing their enterprises, and working in th
                     •
                   harts of his children: for Gods prouidence doth first worke & bring to passe good things, secōdly it permitteth euill things to be done▪ but then thirdly, it directeth, and ordereth a
                     •
                   things both good and bad to his owne glory▪ and to the saluation of his children. So God turned Adams fall to the manifesting of hi
                     •
                   owne glory, and to Adams good, for by thi
                     •
                   meanes, had Adam experiēce of Gods grea
                     •
                   and infinite mercy, and might say, By this 
                        〈◊〉
                      know that thou fauorest me, because tho
                        •
                      forgauest me, and didst not suffer the deuil

to triumph against me, so all the slippes, and falles of Gods children are turned to their good, in as much as by them they are made more fearefull of sinne, and more watchfull ouer their wayes, as the child is fearefull of the candle when he hath once burnt his finger in ye flame. And S. Paule telleth vs from God,
                     Rom. 8.28 that all things shall fall out for the good, yea for the best, to them that loue God. Now of this point we may make a very holy vse. It serueth first to confirme and vphold our faith in the prouidence of God, and not to feare the endeuours of the wicked, because we sée that God doth still dispose of thē to our good if we be his children. Againe this may stand vs in good stead, when our affe
                  
                     •
                  tions begin to boyle, in a burning desire of reuenge against our enemies, would we be reuenged of thē? The best way to be reuenged of our enemies is to pitie their case, and to make that profite of them, which Dauid did of his, that is, still to looke to God in thē, thē shall we be sure to be no loosers, but gayners by them, whither they will or no.
               But here some may demaund and say, Doth God vse to handle his beloued so? or may a man be sure of Gods fauour being

beset with so many enemies? and ouerwhelmed with such heapes of troubles? especially sinne being the cause, wherewith God is prouoked to anger? To which we may answere, that sinne indéede is the cause of all our troubles, but yet whatsoeuer the Lord layeth vpon his children here, it is not a punishmēt of their sinne, for that was discharged by the hellish suffrings of the Lord Iesus Christ, but it is a fatherly correction, frō which we are no more fréed by the death of Christ, then we are fréed from our naturall death. And it is layed vpon vs by our heauē
                  ly father for two principall causes, first to preuent sinne, which we might fall into, as presumption, contempt, vnthankefulnesse, forgetfulnesse of God, and many moe. Secondly, they are layed vpon vs as Phisicke to cure and heale sinnes, which we are already fallen into, and this is that which Dauid confesseth,
                     Psal. 119.67.71. when he saith, before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keepe thy word, and therefore he saith, It was good for him to be afflicted, that he might learne the statutes of the Lord. And in both these endes of our afflictions,1. Cor. 11.32. the Lordes purpose is to stay vs that we runne not with the wicked

world headlong to damnatiō, whom he hath geuen ouer to them selues.
                     Esay. 1.5. So that troubles and enemies are sent to vs the children of God as Phisicke: and therewith all he sends a priuate messenger to tell vs that he loueth vs for all that, & it is because he loueth vs, & to that end yt we may be assured yt he loueth vs:
                     Rom. 8.15 16. & that messenger is his spirite of adoptiō, which certifieth our spirites that we are the children of God. And this being once made sure, then all is sure.
                     A needful question▪
                     
                   But now the question is by what ordinarie meanes the spirite of adoption doth conuay this certificate of Gods fauour vnto the harts of Gods children in their afflictions? for as God doth assure his children of his louing fauour in Christ Iesus, so he doth it by ordinarie meanes, which meanes being not vsed, or neglected, this assurance faileth, and falleth from vs, and nothing remaineth but either a bare fācie flotting in the aire, in stead of a sure faith builded on a firme foundation,
                     The meanes whereby the assuraunce of Gods fauour is wrought.
                   and when trouble comes, an impatient spirite to beare vp the burdē, and when death comes, a heape of sorrow, and a heauie waight of despaire to presse downe to ye lowest hells. The meanes then by which the spirite of God doth worke

this assuraunce in the harts of the godly is the preaching of the Gospell, which is called glad tidings, because it makes the harts of the faithfull to become ioyfull, and glad. And S Paule (to put vs out of doubt that the spirite worketh not without the word of God) calleth the word the sword of the spirite,
                  
                     Ephe. 6.17 to teach vs that howsoeuer the spirite of God must beate downe Sathan, and cut downe infidelitie, impatiencie, despaire, presumption, and all our vnrulie affectiōs, and howsoeuer it worketh faith,
                     Esay. 11.2. patience, ioy, strēgth, courage &c. yet all this it effecteth 
                     •
                  and bringeth to passe by the meanes of the word of God preached, read, heard, marked, and meditated vpō, for as the word without the spirite is but dead to the hearer, so the spirite of God without the opening of Gods wil in hi
                     •
                   word, doth not ordinarily giue this comfortable assurance of Gods loue. Aske the Prophet Dauid himselfe, who had this comfortable assuraunce of Gods fauour in affliction▪ aske him (I say) how he came be it, or how i
                     •
                   came to him, and he will tell vs, that by th
                     •
                   word of God he came vnto it, for so he saith▪ 
                  Except thy law had bene my delight,
                  
                     Psal. 119.92.
                   
                  I had perished in my affliction: for therein he foū
                  
                     •
                  
                  
many gracious promises of his God, both for the punishing of his enemies, for the defending and rewarding of himselfe, and all Gods seruaunts, & for the forgiuenesse of his sinnes, which were the cause of all his troubles, and therefore the promise of God he chalengeth at Gods hand.
                     Vers 49.50. 
                  Remēber thy promise made to thy seruant, wherein thou hast caused me to trust, vpon this promise of God he resteth and stayeth himself. It is my comfort in my trouble, for thy promise hath quickned me. And when he looked into this booke of God, the storehouse of his promises, there he found also how necessarie affliction was for him he found the causes thereof, and what vse to make of all his enemies, & so through the inward working of the spirite of sanctification, he behaued himselfe at all times accordingly, and therefore when he saith it was good for him that he was afflicted, he addeth,
                     Vers. 71. 
                  that he might learne the statutes of the Lord, to shew that the godly doe not know how good their afflictions be, vntil they haue learned the statutes of the Lord. And therefore at another time he said, that he was much moued at the prosperitie of the wicked,
                     Psal. 73. and had much a do to kéepe himselfe

in an innocent,13. and vpright life, hearing, & seeing the wicked so farre out of square,14. vntill he went into the house of God,16. and when he came into that schoole once,17. he was taught by the word,18. and the spirite of God, what vse to make of all: and then he saw how wisely, and iustly the Lord ordereth all things in the world, to teach vs, that it is impossible for vs, to make right vse of troubles, and to beare our selues in prosperitie and aduersitie as we ought, vntill we become schollers to the word of God, and submit our selues vnto the same.
               Nowe as the word of God is the meanes of this comfortable assurance, so is it not alwayes effectual to worke this assurance vnto vs, except we vse it as it should be vsed of vs, some think it sufficient to haue it in their house, like the talēt hid in the napkin. Some thinke it enough to heare it read at church, or to reade it thē selues at home: some thinke it necessary to be preached, and expounded, but not materiall whether they come at the preaching or no,
                     Iudg. 17.13. like Micah who thought himself safe whē he had a leuite in his house: some thinke it sufficient if they heare it, but they wilbe at their choise whether to beléeue

it or no: some giue credit vnto it, thinking it to be true, & hold that to be sufficient: when they come neither reuerently, nor hū
                  bly prepared vnto it, but will be at libertie to descant vpon it, and to censure both preaching and preacher at their pleasure, like the proud cauilling auditors of Ezechiell,
                  
                     Eze. 33.32 which talked & iested against him when they were amongst them selues, and made as much accompt of his preaching, as of a fidlers song. Some think it sufficient if they heare it once a yeare, once a moneth, or once a quarter: some thinke it sufficient if the word sound in a Church, it is no matter out of whose mouth it come, whether the speaker haue a calling or no calling, but the parish Clarke and the parish Priest is all one to them. But if they haue a Preacher, then all is cocke sure on their side, then they must néedes be sure of Gods loue. Some againe thinke the plaine and bare word of God not sufficient to work this cōfortable assurance, without a mixture of Rhetorick, Philosophy, Schoole-trickes, Poetrie, profane writers, Gréeke & Latin, and merrie iests, &c. as they that crie, Prophecie of new wine, and strong drinke, and if they haue these things clattering about

their eares, then they go away from ye church as full as a bladder filled with wind. And some againe hold opiniō, that if the preacher stand neuer so litle aboue his hower at any time, it is inough to marre all that went before. And some thinke, that if there be any mention made of Gods iudgements against their sinnes, it is inough to driue them to despaire, and so quite from the exercises. And many post off all hearing of the word, or vsing any holy exercises of religion, vntil they be stricken with age or sickenesse, like the foolish Uirgins, which put off all to the last cast. Now all these would be assured of Gods fauour when affliction doth assaile thē, yea & thinke themselues sure of it, howsoeuer the world shall go with them, but they all deceiue them selues.
                     The first sort.
                   First, they which thinke the bare reading of it to be sufficient, but the expounding & applying thereof to be a néedlesse thing, they deceiue them selues: for as reading is a good and holy meanes for the confirmation of faith, and the consolation of the inward man: so without the opening of the word, & applying of the same, this comfortable assurance of Gods louing fauour is not ordinarily wrought, whereby the soule

is brought to rest in the bed of peace.
                     Psal. 4.7. For proofe whereof we are to listen to the voyce of God himself which is the best iudge in this behalfe. Iob both handleth the case, and determineth the case very plainly,
                     Iob 33.19. 
                  A man is stricken with sorow vpon his bed, and the grife of his bones is sore, So that his life causeth him to abhorre bread, and his soule daintie meate.
                  20. 
                  His flesh fayleth that it cannot be seene, and his bones clatter, So that he draweth to the graue,
                  21.22. 
                  and his life to the buriers, meanig that his afflictiō both of body & soule is so extreme, that by meanes thereof he is brought to deaths doore. Now sée what must comfort this man.23. 
                  If there be a messenger, or an interpreter, one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnesse.
                  24. 
                  Then wil God haue mercie vpon him, and will say, deliuer him, that he go not downe to the pit, for I haue receiued a reconciliation.
                  25. 
                  Then shall his flesh be as fresh as a childs, and shall returne as in the dayes of his youth.
                  26. 
                  He shall pray vnto God, and he will be fauourable vnto him, and he shall see his face with ioy. &c. These are great things, and therefore Iob saith, that he that should do them must be a messenger, he must be sent of God, he

must be an interpreter of the will of God, & a rare man, one of a thousand: therefore a blind reader is not sufficiēt for these things. The Eunuch was reading the prophet Esay
                  
                     Act. 8.28. by him selfe,31.33. but he knew not what he read vntill Philip expounded it vnto him:38.39. & after that he beléeued, he was baptized, & he went on his way reioycing. The Iaylour was in his desperate dumps, and but in a mad mood, when for feare he went about to kil himself, but after Paule
                  
                     Act. 16.27 had preached vnto him the word of the Lord,30. he beléeued in Christ, and reioyced that he and his beléeued in God:32. for then had he the assurance of Gods fauour in Christ Iesus,34. which he had not before: to shew vs how necessarie the preaching of the word is, for the working of this assurance. To this agréeth also the Apostle S. Paule,
                  
                     Rom. 5.1. for (saith he)
                     Rom. 10. 
                  We being iustified by fayth in Christ,
                  14. 
                  haue peace with God, but this faith is wrought by hearing,19. & hearing by the preaching of the word of God. All which do teach vs, that if we would haue the assurance of Gods louing fauour in our troubles, and on our death bed, we must frequent the preaching of the word of God, not because God cannot worke faith without the meanes of

preaching, but because in his singular wisedome & mercy, he hath appointed this means, and promised a blessing to his own appointment, and to none else.
               This meanes being neglected,
                     The neglect of the meanes what it doth. Second sort.
                   the comfort is abated, and the assurance is hazarded, our faith is weakened, and the deuil aduantaged against vs. And this may appeare to be true by the parable of the worldlings, which preferred their oxen, farmes, their ploughs, and their families, before ye feast of the word,
                     Mat. 22. not denying it to be good, but they had businesse to do, and they could not intend it, and therefore in the end were shut quite out from the feast of Gods louing fauour. This may further be séene in the confession of the Church and Spouse of Christ, which Salomon hath recorded in his booke of Songs the fift Chapter.
                     Cant. 5.2. 
                  My beloued (saith the Church) knocked and called, saying, Open vnto me, my sister, my loue, my doue, my vndefiled, for my head is full of dew, and my lockes with the drops of the night, meaning yt he had daunced long attendance vpō her, as one that standeth knocking without the doores all night, but sée what cold entertainement she gaue him, I haue put off my

coate, how shall I put it on? I haue washed my feete,
                  
                     Vers. 3. 
                  how shall I defile them? her meaning is, she was in bed at her ease, and was loth to rise to let him in, a litle thing stayed her frō rising, but what gat she by her sluggish delayes? &c. Afterward she arose, and opened the doore, but her welbeloued was gone and past,

                  she sought him, but could not finde him, she called, but he answered not. All this is to teach vs that if we would be assured of Christ his loue, and saluation by him, we must séeke it betimes without delay while it is offred vnto vs, for although he knocke now, yet we know not whether he will call againe or no. And besides that, the more delayes we make, the further are we of from him, and the more vnfit are we to receiue the word hereafter: for when Sathan hath so farre preuailed with men that he can bring them to a custome in sinne, in negligence, in slouth

                  ulnesse, or any thing els, what followeth, but hardnesse of hart? and what followeth, hardnesse of hart but impenitēcie?
                     Rom 2.4.5. as the Apostle teacheth the Romanes: this would be considered of all, but especially of those men, which haue so many lets and hinderances, that they can not find

any time for the hearing of the word of God. Thus you sée that they, which prolong the time thus of hearing the word preached, and yet thinke to haue the assuraunce of Gods loue, they do but deceiue them selues.
               But (I) misse neuer a Sermon saith one,
                     A third sort.
                   I go euery day to the lecture. But deceiue not thy selfe, thou mayest for all that be as farre from hauing that swéete assuraunce of Gods loue in Christ Iesus, as he that heareth it neuer a day, except thou come both with reuerence and humblenesse of spirite, like a young child, tractable, teachable, and willing to be reformed, for the Lord resisteth the proud,1. Pet. 5.5. Luke. 1.53 and giueth grace to the humble, and as he filleth the hungry with good things, so it is as certaine that he sendeth the rich emptie away, although they come neuer so often. This you sée that proud and prophane hearers do likewise deceiue them selues.

his Phisitiō: so you which say, say what you will, we will do as we list. &c. You shal surely perish, and goe to the deuill, for all your hearing, without spéedy repentaunce. For whosoeuer beleeueth,

            THE THIRD SERMON, Nouember 28. 2. Sabboth.
            
               And as for me thou vpholdest me in mine integritie, and doest set me before thy face for euer.
            
            
               THe Prophet Dauid by two sortes of arguments assureth himselfe, that Gods fauour belongeth vnto him, the first is drawen from his outward estate in respect of the world, which was very good: in as much as his enemies did not triumph ouer him. The second ariseth from a view of his owne inward estate, in respect of

God, which was much better, for that the Lord vpheld him in his vprightnesse, and had a continuall care both of his soule and body. The first argumēt of Gods fauor is strong: but being ioyned to the second it is sure. The first is great, but because it is a generall thing and may be giuen to the vngodly to ouercome his enemies (I meane the enemies of his body) therefore Dauid resteth not in that, but searcheth within himselfe, to sée if he can finde any inward tokens of Gods fauour: and searching, he findeth two within himselfe, the first was Gods hand vpholding him from falling away from his God, the second was Gods eye alwayes vpon him for his safetie. And hauing found these at home in himselfe, he triumpheth, and blessed God the giuer.
            
               
                  Vers. 12.So that now the king sheweth what inward token he had receiued of Gods fauour▪ for God doth more for his children then for the wicked, he speakes comfortable things to the soules of his people. Ioseph loued all his brethrē, but Beniamin he loued with a more speciall loue, and therefore he gaue messe
                  •
                of meate to them all,
                  Gen. 43. vlt.
                but Beniamins mess
                  •
                was fiue times so much as the rest, so Go
                  •
               
               
giueth liberally to all his creatures as a good and a louing God,
                  Psal. 104.24. in so much that the earth is full of his mercies, but his loue to his elect children by Christ, is a thousand times more then to the rest, for them he vpholdeth in their integritie▪ 
               and doth set them before his face for euer. Gods loue is more to men then to beasts: of men, his fauour is more to his Church, then to all the world besides,
                  Psal. 87.2. for he loueth the gates of Zion more then all the dwellings of Iacob, he hath chosen that for his resting place, he hath a delight in that, there brake he ye bow he knapped the speare in péeces,
                  Psal. 132.13. he burnt ye chariots with fire,
                  Psal. 76.1.2.3. yea he wounded euen kings in the day of his wrath for Zions sake, that is, for ye loue that he bare towardes his chosen people. Againe, in this visible Church he fauoreth his elect more then the rest, and his louing fauour to themward is greater then to all the world besides. For Gods Church is like a noble mās house,2. Tim. 2.20. wherein are vessels of gold, and vessels of earth, and his vessels of gold are set vp safely, & kept more daintily vnder locke & key thē the other.
                  Psal. 147.7.8. 
               Sing vnto the Lord (saith Dauid) sing vpon the harpe vnto our God, which couereth the heauen

with cloudes, and prepareth raine for the earth, and maketh the grasse to grow vpon the moūtaines:
               9. 
               Which giueth to beasts their foode, and to the young rauēs that cry. Thus much he doth for all his creatures, but as for his seruaunts which feare him & attēd vpon his mercies he delighteth in them, and takes great pleasure in thē: such pleasure he takes not in the strength of a horse, nor in the legs or stature of a man. From all the creatures in generall he descendeth to the Church in particular and saith.12. 
               Prayse the Lord O Ierusalem, prayse thy God O Zion.
               13. 
               For he hath made the barres of thy gates strong, and hath blessed thy children within thee.
               14. 
               He setteth peace in thy borders, and satisfieth thee with the flower of wheat. But hath he done no more for his Church then so? Yes that he hath.19. 
               He sheweth his word vnto Iacob, his statutes and his Iudgements vnto Israell.
               20. 
               He hath not delt so with euery nation, neither haue they knowledge of his iudgements.
            
            In the first of the Canticles: the Church desireth to be kissed with ye kisses of Christes mouth, that is, to haue more testimonies and tokens of his loue then one, or of one kind, for by outward things (saith the wiseman) a

man can not know loue and hatred,
               
                  Eccl. 9.1.2 because all things come a like to all. Therefore saith the Church vnto her spouse, kisse me with the kisses of thy mouth, for thy loue is sweeter thē wine, that is, let me haue a continuance of thy fauour towardes me, and many sure tokens thereof, for no pleasure or profit is comparable to thy loue.
                  Cant. 1.1. The kisses of Christ are his blessings bestowed vpon his Church, his blessings are either tēporall or eternall, corporall or spirituall. His spirituall blessings are of two sortes, either outward or inward. His outward yet spirituall blessings, whereby he witnesseth his loue to his Church, they are the preaching of the word, and the administration of the Sacraments, these be great benefites, and swéete kisses of the Lord our God: but because these are cō
               mon to the hypocrite which is close and craftie in hart, aswell as to the faithfull whose hart is vpright before the Lord, we are not to rest in these outward things, but to search and neuer leaue searching, vntill we finde out the inward kisses of Christ Iesus, which are most sure testimonies of his loue indéed. And those are faith in Christ Iesus, repentaunce vnfained for sinne, patience in affliction,

ioy in the holy Ghost, and all the other fruites of the sanctifying spirite, whereof we may read more in Gal. 5.
                  Gal. 5.22. Euery one cannot shew these, but onely he, which hath the spirite of sanctification. Saul had the spirite, that is, some gifts of the spirite, and yet was reiected, but Dauid had the sanctifying spirite, and therefore was not reiected of the Lord, neither did he reiect ye Lord, but by this was sure of Gods fauour to his soule. If Dauid had bene a king, a conquerer, a man of wisedome, of pollicie, of learning, and of riches, and in all these vncomparable, and had lost his integritie, he had lost his marke of Gods loue, and might haue followed Saul well inough. So if we were rich, wise, and learned, if we were Preachers, Bishops, Prelates, Lordes, Earles, Dukes and Emperours, & haue lost our sinceritie, our zeale, our loue, our faith, our religiousnesse, our godlinesse, a good conscience, we haue lost our markes too, and may follow Saul too wel inough for all our outward pompe and glory. On the other side, if one haue enemies, or be in pouertie, disgrace, imprisonment, out of credite with the world, out of liuing, &c. and kéepeth a sincere heart, and a good conscience

in all these things, he may say, and sing too with Simeon, Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace, if his time be come.
                  Gen. 25.30. They which haue the outward kisses, & not the inward assurances, are like Esaw with his pottage, but without his birthright. But they which haue lost all, but kéepe still their integritie, are like Iacob, who lost his pottage but found the inheritance, and the loue of God: for God loued Iacob, but hated Esaw.
               
                  Rom. 9.13. Psal. 4.6. 
               Many wil say (saith the Prophet) who will shew vs any good? that is any worldly good, but Lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs, and then I shall haue more ioy of heart, then they that haue their corne, and wine, and oyle increased. So now a dayes, many séeke for Gods loue in the cō
               mon trash of the world, and they run about the world by sea and by land crying, Who will shew vs any credit, any worship, any riches, any offices, any promotions, &c. And some of the Ministerie cry, Who will shew vs any moe liuings, any Deaneries, any Bishoprickes, any spirituall promotions, yea & this is the voyce of gaping Courtiers too by report: and if they spéed of these & such things, then they are sure (as they thinke)

that God loueth thē, as Achab thought him selfe well if he might obtaine Naboths vineyard: but many times it falleth out, that as Dinah while she wandred to sée fashions, & sought to féede her fancy vpon the daughters of a strange countrey, she lost her virginitie amongst the sonnes of the country. So some men while they séeke to féede & fill their gréedie worme of couetousnesse and ambition with diuerse pleasures & profits of ye world, they loose their sinceritie amongst them, and make shipwracke of faith and a good conscience. And then they go away out of their houses,1. Tim. 1.19. as Thamar went out of her brother Amnons chamber, with her maidens garment of diuerse colours rent, because she was enforced to leaue her maydenhead behind her.2. Sam. 13.18. So these worldlings which sometime with Demas followed Paule, but nowe with Demas embrace the present world, are enforced to go away with their garment of diuerse colours rent and torne: for whiles they will venter through the bushes, and thorns of worldly cares, to get worldly promotion, is it not a miracle if they come out with their zeale not quenched, their courage not abated, their faith not blasted, their loue

not cooled, their knowledge not withered, their humilitie not defaced, their sinceritie not decreased, & the whole garment of pietie and Religion not scratched, torne, and rent in péeces? And then a man may say to them, as Absalō
                said to his sister, Hath thy brother met with thee? so, hath not ye world met with them?
                  Vers. 20. Iudg. 4.21 And no maruell, for if Sisera looke for any rest, or refreshing in Iaels tent, he shall surely be made naile fast. So if any wil séeke for infallible markes of Gods fauour in Sathans tents, and in the worlds tents, or in pleasures tents, or in profites tents, a thousand to one but their sinceritie and godlinesse will be nailefast before they come out againe. What wise man will séeke for grapes vpō thornes? or figs vpō thistles? or, for gold amongst old iron? or hony out of a spider? or heate in the ise? So no wise harted Christian wil looke for certain marks of the Lords fauour, in such things as may be markes of his wrath, as well as of his loue. But if these outward and general graces be offred them, they take them, and if they go from them, they go not after them to loose their sinceritie for thē, but thus they resolue with them selues, O Lord my God

I sée that by no outward thing a man can certainly tell whether he be in thy fauor or no: but if thou vpholdest me in mine integritie, and in the studie of pietie, and the true zeale of thy glory, &c. then I shalbe sure of thy fauour indéede: therfore O Lord if want come, then kéepe my faith in thy prouidence firme and strong, if thou sendest enemies to trie me, kéepe my loue sound, if thou sendest sickenesse or aduersitie, kéepe my patience entire, if riches and preferment come, kéepe my zeale vnquenchable, like Lot who when it was not granted him to abide stil in great Sodome,
                  Gen. 19.20.22. requested that he might go to litle Zoar. And then, although they haue nothing else but the inward testimonie of Gods spirit, they haue inough: for by these inward kisses they are sure of Gods fauour, because a good conscience is a continuall feast to ye afflicted, & makes merrie at home in the house of the inward man,
                  Pro. 15.15 when there is nothing but warre and trouble abroad.
            
               As for me thou vpholdest me in mine integritie.
               This same integritie is like Noahs arke
                     •
                   wherein he was preserued when others perished

being without it: it is like the redde thrid, which the spies of Ioshua gaue to Rahab, it was a charter wherby she claimed her life when the rest were destroyed which had not the like. So is this integritie, of smal reckning (I confesse) with the men of this world, which thinke that there is no other heauen but earth, but as Rahabs thrid was better to her then all her goods and substance when the sword came: so this is better to Gods children then al the world when death

                     Psal. 51.5. 
                  in sinne he was conceiued, and in iniquitie

was he borne, and in another place he saith, that he could not number his sinnes, and therefore prayeth vnto God, to kéepe him from presumptuous sinnes,
                     Psal. 19.12 13. and to clēse him from his secret faults, therefore that is not his meaning, neither can it be his meaning, because he speaketh by the spirite of God, which in diuers other places doth tell vs,
                     Ier. 17.9. 1. Ioh. 1.8. that no man is without sinne. Who can say my hart is cleane, saith one? And whosoeuer saith he hath no sinne deceiueth himself, and there is no truth in him saith another, and therefore that cannot be his meaning, and if he should say so, we are not to beléeue him in this point.
                     What is ment by integritie.
                   But when Dauid speake
                     •
                   of his integritie, and vprightnesse, or innocencie, he meaneth that he is guiltlesse, and frée from that which his enemies did most maliciously charge him with all, so that it hath alwayes respect or relation vnto som
                     •
                   particular matter, wherewith he is charged by men, or to something that is in cōtrouersie betwéene him and his aduersaries. As in the 7. Psalme the 3. verse.
                     Psal. 7.3. 
                  O Lord, if I haue done this thing, if there be any wickednesse in my handes, that is, if it be true that I am accused of. &c. if euer I were guiltie of séeking

                  Sauls hurt, with which some did charge me.8. 
                  Iudge me O Lord, according to my righteousnesse, and according to mine integritie that is in me.
               
               Here in this our text, it signifieth two things. First, that there was no cause in the world, why his enemies should triumph against him: for the Lord had kept him frée from that, which they accused him of. Secōdly, it importeth that his hart and affections were still sound, and not moued to séeke reuenge vpon them, although they had geuen him great and iust occasion so to do.
               If we take it the first way, we may very 
                     •
                  well: for it is a speciall token of Gods fauour, and a notable meanes of comfort, whē the Lord doth kéepe vs frée from the vniust accusations of the world, or when we are not guiltie of those things, which ye wicked may at any time charge vpon vs, and the doctrine

                     •
                  able, is to looke in for a good conscience, and sée that we be falsely accused, which if we 
                     •
                  inde, then all goeth well, and we are mery 
                     •
                  t home, howsoeuer the world shall say or do 
                     •
                  broad, for still I say with Salomon that a

good conscience is a continuall feast.
               Oh if it were true (thou sayest) it would neuer gréeue thée, nay then it might iustly gréeue thée if it were true, which is reported against thée. Wilt thou be gréeued to be blessed? then be not vexed and moued out of order, when thou are slaundered, for blessed are ye when men reuile you,
                  
                     Mat. 5.11. 
                  and persecute you, and speake all manner of euill saying against you falsely for my sake, saith our Sauiour Christ. Oh this is a speciall fauour of God, when we can without checke of conscience appeale to God in our owne harts, and say, Thou O Lord knowest my innocencie in this point. But thy spirit (boyling stil in 
                     •
                   desire of reuenge) wil say, oh but it is good to teach such a one, to vse his toung better another time. Indéede in some cases it is good s

                   to do, as when a mās publique Ministery▪ or the Magistrates gouernment is by hi

                   meanes defaced, but there is no cause for thée to be so out of quiet, or to rage, & storm

                        •
                      for me thou vpholdest me in mine integrity▪
                  
                  
If we take integritie for a sound hart, frée from reuenge, it ministreth no smal profite, and instruction, for the king although his enemies had so vexed him, and had throwen so many slaunderous reportes, and reprochfull speeches against him, yea all their trecheries and conspiracies notwithstanding, yet he thanketh God for that he did not séeke to reuenge againe, but reioyceth that the Lord kept him in the soundnesse & vprightnesse of his hart.
               A notable blessing of God, and a sure token of his fauour vnto vs, whensoeuer we shalbe afflicted, or any way molested, if we finde our harts sound, and our affections to be setled within vs, if we can say, Lord, laye what crosse thou pleasest vpon me, let men speake their pleasures of me,
                     A good meditation.
                   & inuent what 
                     •
                  yes they can, let thē call me by what names they will, and iudge me at their pleasure, so that thou kéepe my hart sound I care not, for if I haue all the goods in the world, and not the integritie of my hart, I am but in a mad case▪ And therefore O Lord, my God, if thou wilt néedes raise vp enemies against me, yet O Lord, graūt me that my hart may be entire, sound, and vpright, and then raise

vp what enemies thou wilt. Then I shalbe sure to speake nothing proudly, nothing vaynegloriously, nothing impatiently, nothing vncharitably, nothing distrustfully, & nothing against thy glory, for if I should do so, alas what should I get by it? I were thē as déepe in sinne as they. No Lord, I am content to referre the whole matter to thée, for although I am falsely charged in this, yet it is thy goodnesse and fauour, which did vphold me,
                     Note.
                   for if thou hadst let me goe after my owne will, then I had bene guiltie indéede. And although in this I be innocent, yet I know my selfe to be guiltie of many things as vile as this, which they know not of: and that is also of thy mercy and goodnesse towardes me poore wretched creature. And as for them thou hast set them a work
                     •
                   to try me, it is thy doing O Lord, though they haue no such purpose, neither know they so much, yet by thy grace, I am so perswaded, and if thou didst not kéepe me from falling, I should be as wicked as they are▪ If we would but enter into this meditatio
                     •
                   with our selues as in the sight of God, the
                     •
                   should we put vp many things more thē w
                     •
                   do, and not vexe one another, yea eate v
                     •
                  
                  
one another at law as we do. Neither would we do so I am perswaded if we did throughly vnderstand the pollicies and slightes of Sathan, for he is very busie to raise vp enemies against vs, and then he is as busie to s
                     •
                  irre vs vp to reuengemēt: what? wilt thou put vp this at his hands? &c. then hath he that he would haue, for while he sets vs one to 
                     •
                  unt another, in the meane time he huntes vs all and therefore let vs pray to God to kéepe our harts sound and vpright.
               If we did but consider on the other side, what daunger our enemie is fallen into by vexing of vs, when we giue him no cause, we would be so farre from reuenging, that we would rather pitie him and lameut him, and pray for him, as our Sauiour Christ did for his enemies,
                     Luke. 23.34. 
                  Father forgiue them they know not they doe. And as Steuen did for his,
                     Act. 7.60▪
                   
                  Lord laye not this sinne 
                        •
                     o their charge. For well may Alexāder the Copper-smith do Paule much hurt, but the Lord will reward him according to his workes.2. Tim. 4.14. And the same God wil no doubt sée 
                     •
                  ur causes redressed in his good time.

whatsoeuer: the last remedy is to say, Lord if I must néedes be thus handled, or if thou wilt néedes take away my goods. &c. thy will be done
                  ▪ onely kéepe my hart vpright before thée, and put my affections in order, and giue me grace that I may be content and put it to thée O Lord, for I had rather haue all the world against me then to haue thée against me: so long as thou louest me, I care not who hate me.
               Oh but if I should follow this counsell thou wilt say, thē my enemy will laugh and reioyce, and insult ouer me, I will neuer beare that. No, I warrāt thée, and if he doth laugh at thée, it is but frō the téeth outward, for saith Salomon to the wicked there is sorrow euen in laughter,
                  
                     Pro. 14.13 he will not tell thée what is within him, if thou didst, or couldest sée into him, thou shouldest sée that, that would make thée to pitie him, and euen shed teares for him. We can not be better reuenged of our enemies, then to let them sée how litle they preuayle against vs, and how litle they moue our patience. For as there is no such greef to a iester or a iugler, as when h
                     •
                   doth sée that with all his iestes and foolerie
                     •
                   he cannot moue mirth nor chaunge the coū
                  tenaunces

of them that heare him, and sée him: so there can be no greater torment to a wicked and a malitious enemy, then to sée thée no whit gréeued, nor moued, at his mallice against thée, but that thou do so beare his iniuries as if there were none at all, for thy aduersaries purpose is to anger thée, and to driue thée into thy dumpes, which if he cannot bring to passe, then is he chafed and vexed ten times more then he was before. Therefore saith the Apostle,
                     Rom. 12.21. 
                  Let vs not be ouercome with euill, but ouercome euill with goodnesse, to teach vs that good is stronger then euill, and what is it that we desire, but to ouercome our enemies or rather the euill that is in them? thē we must do it with that which is contrary to their euill, and that is goodnesse, as fire is quenched not with fire but with water. If thē thy enemy be vaineglorious be not thou so too, but be lowly giuing glory to God, if he be puffed vp with pride, be thou of an humble spirite, if he boast himselfe, abase thou thy selfe: if he curse, blesse thou, if he be hoate, be thou cold, if he blaspheme, doe not yu so. but reproue him in good wordes, & if he be mad, be thou stayed, & so doing yu shalt in the end both weare him,

wearye him. and stay him too. And whē they sée this it will cut their very hart strings asunder, and then thanke thou God for that he hath vpholdē thee in thine integritie. For Sathan whō they serue hath not such a spite to our welth, our learning, or our cunning, or credite (though he loue none of all) as he hath to our godlinesse, & the graces of Gods spirite in vs. Was it Iobs wealth that Sathan so much enuied?
                     Iob. 1.1.8. or did he so sist him as he did, because he was a rich man? nothing gréeued the deuill so much,
                     Iob. 2.3.4. as to sée Iob still continue in his vprightnesse, and when he made him blaspheme and curse the day of his birth, thē he left him, for he careth not greatly how rich men be, so that it be not in godlinesse, nay he will helpe them to gather riches & learning, and credite. &c. if he sée that therewithall they may gather more sinne, and he may gather them to hell, as he was content, yea and ready to make Adam eate one apple more,
                     Gen. 3.3. when he had inough before, because he knew not els how to set God and him at enimitie, which were before at vnitie. Now when Sathan shall thus sift vs, as no doubt he doth, and will sift vs as wheat is sifted (saith Christ) let vs thē looke to our faith,
                     Luk. 22.31 & pray yt it may not fayle: then shall he

& his instrumēts haue their labour for their trauel, whē we shal haue ye assurāce of Gods fauor he vpholding vs in our integrity, which God graūt for his mercy sake. The Papists taught men to know whether they stood in the state of grace or no, by many toyes and deuises, as by going on pilgrimage hither and thither, by offering to this stocke and to that blocke, by going to shrift, and by taking absolution at a balde Priestes hand, by saying their stinte of Mattēs and beads, by kéeping of their dayes and houres, and a number of such odd deuises: but they were all deceiued, because this was of the deuils inuenting, for indéede by these things men were sure of the deuils geace, but not of Gods grace. But if we would know whether we stand in the state of grace or no indéede, here is a triall, if we finde Gods spirite by the preaching of the Gospell subduing the corruptions of our harts, setling our faith in Gods promises, through Christ Iesus, and vpholding vs in our integritie, when by course of nature we should fall into iniquitie, then be we in the state of grace indeede, for thus did Dauid assure himselfe of Gods fauour, and so may we, if we will watch our selues as Dauid did.

               As for me thou vpholdest me, &c.
            
            
               IN these words we are to note further, that the king doth not say simply, I am vpholden, or I haue kept mine integritie, but he saith, thou O Lord hast vpholden me, and doest vphold me, where we may obserue, that though Dauids heart was sincere, and sound, and vpright before God, frée from his enemies vniust accusations, and frée from all de

               re of reuenge: yet all this was giuen him of God, it came not to him by nature to teach vs that of our selues we are not able to kéepe our selues, but God must and doth vphold vs in our vprightnesse, or else we fall as others 
                  〈◊〉
               , and therefore we must craue this grace of God, that he will kéepe vs, and defend vs

with his holy spirit.
            There hath bene a great controuersie betwéene the Papists and vs (euer since the abomination of desolation stoode in the holy place) about this point. They (intending to iustifie them selues with the Lawyer in the Gospell) say, This haue we done, and that can we do, affirming that it is in the power of man (which is but dust and ashes) of himselfe, and by him selfe, to repent when he will, to beléeue when he will, to obey God when he will, and to vphold them selues in their integritie. And to make their matter good, they say, we haue the grace of God giuen vs, to obtaine the grace of God by our own power. Where you sée they speake flat contraries, if they had grace to sée it: for if ye grace of God be giuen vs, then we haue it not of our selues: if we haue it of our selues, then is it not giuen vs of God. Againe if we be vpholden by the grace and fauor of God, then we vphold not our selues: if we haue this power of our selues, then not of God. Thus they speake contrary to them selues, and are deuided in their owne spéeches, like the kingdome of Sathan, which is deuided in it self that it cannot stand. And to speake the

truth, they speake confusedly they know not what, because Babell, that is confusion, is fallen vpon them, as vpō those men which would presume by their owne endeuours without God to climbe vp into heauen.
            Now on the other side, we hold, that we can get nothing but by the helpe of God: and we admit no first grace, but if the grace of God be in vs, it is giuen vs of Gods spirit, not gotten of our owne power, and this we proue by the word of God. God worketh both the wil and the deede,
               
                  Phil. 2.13. saith the Apostle to the Philippians. Of our selues we are not able to thinke a good thought, saith ye same Apostle to the Corinthians, and therefore he demaundeth of all flesh, What hast thou, that thou hast not receiued? as if he should say, nothing: If therefore thou hast receiued it, why doest thou boast as though thou hadst not receiued it? Aske S. Iames, and he wil tell vs, that euery good gift, and euery perfect gift, is from aboue, & commeth down from the Father of light. As if he should say, from whomsoeuer euill doth come, yet all goodnes commeth from God.
                  Gen. 20. Aske Abimelech, and he will tell vs, that if God had not kept him he had kept Abrahams wife. Aske Peters fal,

and that will tell vs, that if we stand by our selues, we shall fall, although we were as strong as Peter. Aske Ieremie, and he will tell vs that the heart is deceiptfull, & wicked aboue all things: yea and though it be borne and bred, and brought vp with vs, and we haue daily familiarity therwith, yet we can not know it. Therefore, if none can know it, much lesse can any reforme it. He that knoweth it can reforme it, and doth reforme it, where it is reformed: but that is ye Lord which searcheth the heart, for so it followeth in the next verse,
                  Ier. 179.10. 
               I the Lord search the heart and trie the reines. Aske Moses and he will tell vs,
                  Gen. 6.5. that the thoughts of mans heart are euill continually, as if he should say. If they be good at any time, that is not of man, but of God. Moses him selfe being in prayer, must haue his hands holdē vp by Aaron and Hur, if Moses were not able of him selfe to hold vp his hands in prayer, much lesse was he able to hold vp his heart in prayer. What doth this teach vs, but this, that if we were as zealous as Moses, yet God must hold vs vp, or else we faint.
            There are but two things required of euery one. The first is, to become holy. The

second is, to continue holy, to conuert and turne into the wayes of God, and to continue in the waies of the Lord: now both these are of God, and not of our selues. Of the first the Prophet Ioell speaketh whē he saith,
                  Ioel. 2. 
               Turne thou vs ô Lord, and then we shall be turned. As if he should say, Except the Lord do turne our hearts, we shall neuer be turned vnto him, for of our selues we cannot. How farre & how long had S. Paule walked in the way of persecuting the Christians, if the Lord had not stayed him by the way? When would Saul haue become a Paule, if the Lord had not changed his name and altered his nature? When would so naturall a persecutor, haue become so holy a professor, if the Lord had not called him? And when he was conuerted, who kept him from falling backe againe?2. Cor. 12.9. 
               My grace (saith the Lord) is sufficient to vphold thee. The spirit of the Lord is therfore called by the Prophet Esay,
               
                  Esay. 11.2. 
               the spirit of wisedome, and vnderstanding, the spirit of counsell, the spirit of courage, the spirit of knowledge, and the spirit of the feare of the Lord: to teach vs, that if we haue holy wisedome, vnderstanding, or counsell, or courage, or knowledge, or the feare of

God, we haue them of Gods spirit, and not of our selues. Whē God gaue Saul a Princely spirit, he spake like a king, but when his spirit was departed from him, he spake like a clowne and not like a king.1. King. 3. Therefore Salomon prayeth vnto God for a wise and vnderstanding heart, to teach vs, yt we haue no such thing of our selues but from aboue. The very phrase of the Scripture, & Dauids manner of speaking doth teach vs no lesse. Thou vpholdest me (saith Dauid) yea euē me thou vpholdest. Now Dauid we know had many singular, and excellēt graces of God, and yet God must vphold him, that is, hold him vp from falling: what doth this argue but thus much, that we are subiect to falling euen the best of vs?

            If he taketh all his graces from vs (as we thinke) at any time, let vs know that he doth it for no other purpose, but that we might know our selues of our selues to be but naked, and so might begge all of him againe. Therfore, whatsoeuer we want, let vs séeke it at the hands of God, that giueth to them which want: when we féele any weakeness

                  Psal. 119. O Lord Open my eyes that I may see the wondrous things of thy law. To set light by vanitie, that is by vaine things and vaine persons is the worke of Gods grace not of nature, therfore we must pray Turne away my eyes from beholding vanitie. What should I say more? Let vs beséech the Lord our strength to vphold vs in our integritie, & he wil vphold vs, so farre as shal make for his own glory, and our owne saluation, and what would we desire more? And this we must desire: for els we cannot stand but fall. Secōdly, this doctrine serueth to humble vs, and may be a preseruatiue against pride, the vse of it is at all times; but chiefly when we begin to waxe proude of any good thing, which the Lord doth worke in vs, or by vs, which indéede is our corrupt nature.

He hath put a frontlet vpon our face, eare rings in our eares, and a beautifull crowne vpon our head, he hath fed vs with fine flower, honie, and oyle, he hath made vs very beautifull, and hath caused vs to grow vp to a kingdome, in so much as our name is spread among the heathen for our beautie, which the Lord hath set vpon vs. What should be said more? In a word the Lord hath compted nothing to costly or to deare for vs, nay what could he do more for his vineyeard yt he hath not done vnto it?
                  Esay. 5. but what of all this? shal we bragge of our ornaments, and be proud of our iewels?
                  Eze. 16.15 16. no: but let vs serue the Lord our God with feare, & reioyce vnto him with reuerence, for if we shall trust in our beautie, and play the harlot,

because of our renowne, if we shall take our garmēts, and decke the high places with diuers colours, if we shall abuse the riches of Gods mercy, what then? Then heare the word of the Lord O harlot. Thus saith the Lord,
                  Vers. 35. because thy shame is powred out, and thy filthinesse discouered through thy fornication with thy louers, I will therfore iudge thée after the manner of harlots, and murtherers, & I will giue thée the bloud of wrath & ielousie. I will giue thée into thy enemies handes, and they shall strippe thée out of all thy clothes, and thy faire iewels, and leaue thée naked and bare. Therefore let him that thinke he standeth, take héede least he fall, but let vs make an end of our saluatiō with feare and trembling,1. Cor. 10. not fearing least we should fall from our election, & loose our saluation, but least we fall from our integritie and loose our manifold blessings, for want o

                more then others haue, or wisedome, zeale, or faith, or loue, or patience, or any grace▪ whatsoeuer, let vs not be proude of them,

because God gaue them, and God can take them againe. If any of vs do stand vpright, and walke in honestie, when others doe fall, let vs not insult ouer them, as the maner of some is,
                  Note that
                to vpbraide honester men then them selues by faultes done fourtie yeare since, and the law fully satisfied for them, and yet this is ye maner of prophane Atheists, which know neither God nor them selues, to cast the old ragges and sores of the seruaunts of God in their face, to make thē and their profession, I meane the Gospell odious in the eyes of the world, and such as them selues are. And for no other cause but because they will not runne with them to ye same excesse of riot:
                  Gen. 27. and euē as Esaw hated Iacob because of the blessing wherewith God had blessed him, so doe these men hate their brethren because they are better then them selues, and séeke to haue them and their wayes reformed according to ye word of God. Is it thinke you a small matter thus to quench, or to gréeue the spirite of God in any of our brethren? doe we stand by our selues? shall we neuer fall? (i) we neuer fall our selues? what if the Lord shall pull the staffe of his grace from vs? then we shal fall with shame

inough and then others shall insult ouer vs, and reioyce at our fals, as we haue reioyced at their faults. For further proofe wherof, let vs heare what the holy Ghost saith to such kinde of persōs in the 52. Psalme.
                  Psal. 52.1.2. &c.
                
               Why doest thou boast thy selfe in thy wickednesse, O man of power? the louing kindnesse of God indureth daily, as if he should say, thou thinkest thy selfe a iolly fellow, and takest pride in thy wickednes, as though thou were a great man of power and shouldest neuer come downe, and because God doth suffer thée from day to day waiting for thy repentaunce, thou thinkest, either that he cannot, or dare not, or that he will not meddle with thée, but now sée thy selfe in thy colours, and then iudge what cause thou hast to bragge it out as thou doest against all the world, what art thou? what goodnes is in thée? Thy toung imagineth mischief, & is like a sharpe rasor, that cutteth deceitfully. Thou doest loue euill more then good, and lyes more thē truth. Thou louest all wordes that may destroy. O deceitfull toung. Now sée thy end. So God shall destroy thee for euer. He shall take thee and plucke thee out of thy Tabernacle, and roote thee out of the land of the liuing.

The righteous also shall see it, and feare, and shall laugh at him, saying, Behold the mā that tooke not God for his strength, but trusted vnto the multitude of his riches, and put his strength in his substance. But I (saith Dauid) shalbe like a greene oliue tree in the house of God: for I trusted in the mercies of God for euer and for euer. But some will say this is spoken against the wicked sort of the world, but I haue, more grace, & moe graces of God then they haue: all the world cannot detect me of such vices, therefore I may be more bold to speake my pleasure of others then they may. But deceiue not thy selfe: thou séest a child, while he will runne vp & down to shew his new clothes,
                  Simile.
                and catcheth a fall, & séeing himselfe downe, and his clothes soiled in the dust he crieth lowder at his fall thē he crowed before at his new coate: so God hath put many excellent graces vpon thée, thou crowest at the sight of them, as Nebuchadnezzar did at the sight of his pallace, & like a foole thou art in admiratiō of thy selfe, till thou stumblest euen vpon thy owne gifts, & when thou art downe, thou which before didst crow like a foole, doest then crye like a

child, especially because thou séest thy excellent graces, euē thy coate of diuers colours, stained and soiled with thy fall, be not therefore proude of thy giftes, nor insolent ouer thy weake brother, for God vpholdeth thée, & God can set him vp, and cast thée downe: for promotion (saith Dauid) commeth neither from the East nor from the West,
                  Psal. 75.6.7. but God is Iudge, and he setteth vp one and pulleth downe another. Thinke we vpon this, and it will humble vs: who would haue thought that Dauids holinesse should haue bene so stayned in the puddle of vncleannesse? Who would haue thought that Salomon his wisedome should euer haue bene wrapt vp in the follie of women? Who would haue thought that Sampsons strength had slept in the lap of weaknesse? Who would haue thought that such a valiant souldier as Peter was, would haue proued such a coward as he was afterward? what do all these but crye with one voyce, take héede how you walke, for it is God that vpholdeth. How many Iudges haue come downe from the bēch to the barre? how many prisoners haue gone vp from the the barre to the bench? how many Dukes, Earles, Lordes, Knightes, and Gentlemen,

how many I say both honorable & worshipfull, wise and learned, stoute and valiant, haue bene pluckt from their places of honor and dignitie, like vntimely fruite from the trée? and bene brought, some to the gibbet? some to the scaffold, and some to perpetuall imprisonment? & what haue they there confessed but thus much, while God vpheld vs we stood, and for want of grace we fell. Therfore let no mā reioyce at our fals, for if you stand, God doth vphold you, and if he do not vphold you, you shal surely fall. Haman was neuer so high in the kings fauour, but at last he was as high on his owne gallowes. Mordecai was neuer so neare the point of death, but at last he was aduaūced to great honor. Iudas once thought much with another, for bestowing a box of ointment more then needed (as he thought) vpon Christ, at last he knew that him selfe had taken more then he ought by thirtie pence, the price of innocent bloud. The swelling red sea was once deuided in sunder, which before threatned present death to any that durst go into it. The Sunne which runneth his course as a swift giant, did once stand still. The rauens did once féede Elias. The dogges bellyes were

once a graue for Iezabell. The fire which by nature consumeth all, had once no power ouer the haire of a mans head. The lice, and the flyes did once preuaile against a kinges power. The hungry Lions had once no power against Daniell. Litle naked Dauid, did once giue great armed Goliath the ouerthrow. There was once a song of Sauls thousand, and Dauids ten thousand. And what was once, which may not be againe if God will? Therfore let no man be proude of that he is, but let him remēber what hath bene, and what may be, and that none vpholdeth from falling but God.
            
               Thou vpholdest me (saith Dauid.) Think we vpon this text when we sée the hand of God in iustice vpon any malefactor? we run out by troupes to sée some executed, some whipped, and some to be some other way openly shamed: we sée them, we talke of thē, we wonder at them, and so we forget them. But if we would then take so much paines, as to lay our inside to their outside, that is, our owne faults concealed in Gods mercie, with their faults reuealed in Gods iustice, we would thē pitie their case, and feare our selues: we would pray for them, and for our

selues, we wold humbly thanke God, which by his grace had kept vs from falling. For if the Lord in mercy should not vphold vs, we might be théeues, or murtherers, and commit any wickednesse as well as others. And this let vs know, that the Lord doth but pick them out to preach this vnto vs, that except he vphold vs we fall, and except we repent we shall fall. Thou vpholdest me (saith Dauid, both a king and a Prophet) and therefore both mightie and learned, to teach vs that there is none so great for liuing, so high for authoritie, nor so excellent for learning, but must depend on God, and trust in God for all these, or else he is no body. The blind world is in another vaine, and their vaine is vaine indéede: for they thinke that honesty and pietie do go by wealth and authoritie, and not by the grace of God. And therefore when they grow to be wealthy in the world, or when they haue gotten authoritie into their hands, they begin to lift vp the head, & to turne vp the snout in the wind, then they dispence with themselues to disgrace al that come before them, if they like them not: and to disdaine al their poore neighbours, be they neuer so godly, but themselues cannot chuse

but be honest, and godly, because they are rich, and in authoritie.
            But what if they chaunce to be taken in a trip, as the wiliest foxe is sometime taken in a snare? what if they be conuinced of falling, or slipping, or some notorious crime? what then? do they then flie to God? nothing lesse, but to their wealth, or friends, or authoritie, or some worldly deuise, & thus they say in their hearts, Thou my money, or thou my countenance, or thou my wealth, or thou my friend in the Court, shalt vphold me: and so, many times through corruption, for friendship, and fauour, for a gift, a present or a bribe, a bad man, and a bad cause are vpholden, which should be cast in ye dust. But Achab shalbe slaine though he will not be known to be Achab, and Ieroboams wise shall be knowne though she disguiseth her selfe: for onely they shall stand vpright whō the Lord vpholdeth, and none else, for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish.
               
                  Psal. 1. vlt.
                But sée the blindnesse of these wise worldlings: because they are wealthie, or mightie, or craftie, they thinke themselues safe inough, and what néede they pray to God for his grace to

vphold them? nay, they make a wonder at him that talketh of any such matter: wheras indéed the more wealth, or authoritie, or learning, or credit, or friends, or any worldly commoditie a man hath, the more néede he hath of Gods grace to vphold him from extremities on euery side, for else all these things will be but so many ropes whereby Sathan will pull him to hell.
            Last of all, if this doctrine were wel learned, and stedfastly beléeued, it would serue in stéede of a moderator to end many bitter contentions, for commonly in contending one with another, we say, Thou art this, and that, and I am this, and that, thy better, and honester then thou, and so foorth. But the Apostle giueth vs other counsell,
                  Gal. 6.1. 
               Brethren if any man (saith he) be fallen by occasion, you that be spirituall restore such a one with the spirit of meekenesse, considering thy self lest thou also be tēpted. And (saith he) in another place,
                  Tit. 3.3.4. 
               We our selues also were in times past vnwise, disobedient, deceiued, seruing lustes and diuerse pleasures, liuing in maliciousnes, and enuie, hatefull and hating one another, but whē the bountifulnesse and loue of God our Sauiour appeared we were otherwise, and

so may others be hereafter, which are not yet, and we may be hereafter as others are now, if God doth not vphold vs: for it is he that vpholdeth them which stand, which raiseth them that are downe, which strengtheneth the weake, and casteth downe the prou

                in the imagination of their hearts.

            THE FIFT SERMON, December 12. 4. Sabboth.
            
               And doest set me before thy face for euer.
            
            
               WE haue heard already that God did vphold Dauid in his innocencie, whereby he was assured of Gods fauour towards him. Now we shall heare, how God preserued him in safetie, which is another pledge of his loue towardes him. In these words we haue two things to consider. First what God did for Dauid, he set him before his face
               ▪ Secondly, how long this loue lasted, for euer: when he saith, Thou doest set me before thy face. It is as much as if he should say, by manifest signes and tokens of deliuerance, thou doest let me know that thou hast me in remembrance: for when God séemeth to forget his children, he is sayd to hide his

face,
                  Psal. 44.24 as appeareth in Psalm. 44.24. where the Church complaineth in this maner, Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our miserie and affliction? that is, why doest thou not shew vs thy helpe, that we may knowe thou doest remember vs? Therefore when he doth make it manifest that he doth remē
               ber vs, he is said to set vs before his face.
            This sheweth what a care the Lord hath of them whom he loueth, and what affection he doth beare vnto them whom he vpholdeth in the integritie of their heart, as a thing which a man hath alwayes in his sight: 
                  〈◊〉
                doth God loue his children, that he can no

                abide for loue to let them go out of his sight. As the husband that loueth his wife, thinket

                  ••
               
               
his Church. As the father or the mother will haue that infant in their sight, which they loue most dearely, so God will haue his Church in his sight, which he loueth most tenderly. As the tutour will haue his pupill in his presence to shew his care and his loue towardes him, so the Lord, which hath takē vpon him our tuition doth set vs before his face, that we may know what care he hath ouer vs, therefore are such phrases vsed in the Scripture,
                  Esay. 49.15.16. as Esay. 49.15.16. Can a womā forget her child & not haue cōpassion on the sonne of her wombe? though they should forget, yet will not I forget thee, saith the Lord. Behold I haue grauen thee on the palme of my handes, thy walles are euer in my sight, to shew that no enemies can come against his Church, but he must know thē, and no breaches can be made in the walles of his Church, but he must sée them, and sée who made them. And so long it cannot chuse but go well with his Church. And therefore it followeth in the next verse,17. 
               Thy builders make hast, and thy destroyers, and those that made thee wast, are departed from thee. In the 10. of S. Iohn 28.
                  Iohn. 10.28. The sonne himself saith of his spouse the elect. I geue vnto them eternall

life, neither shall any plucke them out of my hād, to shew how safe they are with him, and how mindfull he is of them. In figure whereof, Aaron the high Priest (who was also a figure of Christ) was commaunded by God in the 28. of Exodus to weare a breast plate with foure rowes of precious stones.
                  Exod. 28.17.18.19.20. 
               In the first row, a Rubie, a Topace, and a Carbuncle. In the second row, an Emeraude, a Saphire, and a Diamonde. In the third row, a Turkis, an Achate, and a Hemetite, In the fourth row, a Chrysolite, an Onix, and a Iasper. And the stones shalbe according to the names of the children of Israell, twelue according to their names, grauen at signets, euerie one after his name, and they shalbe for the twelue Tribes: all this is to shew what accōpt the Lord doth make of his chosen people. But where must these stones 
                  〈◊〉
                worne? he sheweth where in the 29. verse. So Aaron shall beare the names of the children of Israell, in the breast plate of Iudgemēt vpon his hart, whē he goeth into the holy place, for a remembraunce continually before the Lord. And Aaron shall beare the Iudgement of the children of Israell vpon his hart continually. And what is this for, but to shew

the continuall care that Christ hath of his Church. For Aaron is a figure and resemblaunce of Christ, the precious stones are a figure of the Church of Christ. Aaron must weare them vpon his breast, that is in his sight, so Christ hath his people alwayes in his sight. As it was impossible for Aaron to forget the stones, which were in his sight, so is it impossible that Christ our true Aaron should forget his people, which beléeue in his name, but hath them in continuall remembraunce, being now gone into the holy of holies, that is the kingdome of his father, the most holy place of all. And the same care which the Lord Iesus had of the Iewes his choise people at the first, the same care hath he of the Gentils, that is of vs and other nations of the earth, which beléeue in him: because the wall of separation is pulled down, and there is now no respect of persons with the Lord,
                  Gal.
                but in all nations, he that feareth the Lord,
                  Act. 10. and worketh righteousnesse is accepted of him.
            
               As for me thou doest set me before thy face for euer.
               This then sheweth that none are in such

safetie as the godly, none so wel guarded as the godly, none so well prouided for as the godly, for God doth set them before his face for euer, so that howsoeuer the world goeth, yet God doth alwayes remēber thē, as he did remember Abraham whē Sodome was destroyed,
                     Gen. 19.29. for as he was mindfull of his promise, which he made to our forefather Abraham,
                  
                     Luke. 1.72 73. which is called the father of the faithfull, so will he be no lesse mindful of his promise, which he made to his séede, yt is to all ye faithfull for euer. Because he is the Lord &

                     st esse. He can do no more thē he can. But with the Lord our heauenly father it is not so: for, as he is able being almightie, so he is most willing being our father through his sonne Christ. As he is willing, so is he vnchaūgeable, as he is vnchaungeable, so hath he all knowledge, and therefore knoweth by whō, at what time, in what place, in what maner, and for what cause any thing is done in the whole world, and as he hath all knowledge, so is his Maiestie euery where present, therfore there is no flying from his presēce. And as he is euery where,
                     Psal. 139. so is he iust and true, and therefore cannot be bribed, nor peruerted, & as he is all in all things, so all things

are his, and of him are all things whatsoeuer they be, and therefore he hath néede of nothing. What shall we say more? shall not therefore Gods children be most safe, & most happy before his face, in whose presence is life, and at whose right hand are pleasures for euermore? no doubt of it. Let the wicked then tremble, let Sanballat and Tobias be astonished, let Ashur & Pashur be abashed, let Corah and his cōpanie be confounded, let Ioab and Iudas go hang them thēselues with their trecherous kisses, and their traiterous conspiracies, let Ananias dissēble, & his wif

God, that is some litle sparke of his Maiestie, which did so coole his courage, that his traiterous hand was not able to accomplish the bloudie deuise of his hart, the Lordes name be blessed for euer. And were it possible for her to haue escaped so many daungers as she hath passed through euen from her infancie, if the Lord had not set her before his face, and geuen his louing kindnesse charge to waite vpon hir? The Lord therefore set her in his sight, and defend her with the light of his countenaunce for euermore.
               But if this be true will some say, why do the wicked séeme to preuaile so often as they do against those which feare the Lord? Surely it is true, they séeme indéede to preuaile against them, when they confounde themselues. And for the most part their laughter is but from the téeth outward,
                     Pro. 14.13 and the end of their mirth is heauinesse. But ye truth is so, that God séeing his children to were proude of his presence, and to forget themselues like the Disciples,
                     Mat. 17.4. when they saw Christ a litle transfigured, he hides his face for a while, & sets the wicked vpon them, and giueth Sathā leaue to sift them, yet not so, but that he hath stil an eye vnto them, & will sée thē take

no hurt. What a comfort is this to the godly? to thinke that when heauen and earth go together, yet their God hath them in an euerlasting remembraunce: but for this they were of all men most miserable, for but few in the world do care for them. But our vntamed nature will not so be aunswered. And our impatient humours will not so be satisfied, for we feare that if we should striue to lead a godly life, to put vp wrongs, and to walke in innocēcie and faithfulnesse, no body will care for vs, or regard vs, we shal lye open to the iniuries of all the world, euery bodies plough will go ouer vs,
                     Psal. 129.3 & make long furrowes vpon our backes. This indéede is the voyce of worldly reason

                     Psal. 27. I am poore & in miserie (saith he) but ye Lord careth for me. But thou wilt say, this is particularly spoken of Dauid, what

is that to me? yes saith the Prophet, it is for thee too, for who so dwelleth in the secret of the most high, shall abide in the shadow of the almightie,
                     Psal. 91.1. 
                  I will say vnto the Lord, O my hope and my fortresse, he is my God in him will I trust, surely he will deliuer me frō the snare of the fowler, and frō the noysome pestilence. &c.
               
               As this comfort is great, and large, yet it perteineth to none, but to the godly: for this loue token is giuen to none, but to such as stand in the integritie, and vprightnesse of their hart. Yet God is good to Israell (saith the Psalmist) but marke what followeth,
                     Psal. 73.1.

So, not the Idolatrous, nor superstitious, nor couetous, nor ye malicious, nor proude, nor prophane, nor beastly contēners of God, but the true worshippers of God, the méeke, the faithfull, the lowly, the godly, shalbe had in remēbraunce

before the Lord. Whosoeuer can truly say with Dauid, Thou vpholdest me in mine integritie, may vndoubtedly follow, & chearefully sing with Dauid, and thou doest set me before thy face.
               
               But how long will the Lord set his children before his face? for euer, saith the Prophet, y• is, he will neuer be wearie of doing good vnto thē, but from time to time he will stand by them,
                     Pro. 21.31 no power shall withstād him, no pollicie shall preuent him, no eloquence shall turne him, no wisedome shall circumuent him, no bribes shall peruert him, for he hath sworne once by his holinesse, that he will neuer faile his seruant Dauid,
                  
                     Psal. 89.35. nor alter the decrée that is gone out of his mouth. His knowledge decreaseth not. his strength abateth not, his arme is not shortned. His giftes are without repentaunce.
                     Rom. 11. He is not like Isaac that hath but one blessing,
                     Gen. 27.38. but the more he giueth the more he hath to giue, his storehouse is euer emptied, & euer full. The pooles of his mercy, are not like the poole about Ierusalē, which might be dried vp with tramplings of an armie of horsemen and horses,2 King. 19. but they are such as all the sinnes of a thousand worldes can neuer drie vp, much

lesse the sinnes of his chosen. Therefore it is said in the Psalme,
                     Psal. 130.7.8. 
                  with the Lord is mercie, and with him is plenteous redemption, and he shall redeeme Israell from all his sinnes, if they were moe then they are: for his redēption is not scant redemption, no more then néedes must, like a garment that is but fit for one mans backe onely, but it is plenteous, and abounding,
                     Psal. 136. euen for euer and for euer,
                     Mat. 14.20 like the fiue loaues & two fishes, which fed fiue thousand to the ful, and yet were not spent, by twelue baskets full which remained, & that was more thē was set downe. His loue to his Church was before all worldes. In this life he loueth, and for euer he loueth vs: therefore his loue is called euerlasting loue. He doth set his people before his face for euer, that is, in prosperitie, in aduersitie, in sicknesse, in health, in peace and in warre, and at all times, in bed and at boord, in the house, and in the field, abroad and at home, at sea and at lād, in temple and in tent, & in all places: therefore is he called ye God of ye hills and the God of the vallies, what shall I say more?1. King. 20.28. He is for euer the same, and chaūgeth not. He hath not two willes, as the Papistes do teach: a former will, and an afterwill, a

doctrine most damnable, and vncomfortable, but he is God and neuer chaungeth,
                  
                     Mal. 3. 
                  and the righteous shall therefore be had in an euerlasting remembraunce, he doth not say the rich or the pleasaunt conceipted, or the mightie, or the wittie, or the beautifull. &c. But the righteous shalbe had in remēbraūce.
                  
                     Psal. 112.6 As if he should say, the wicked shall be euerlastingly forgotten, be they neuer so wise, neuer so wealthie, neuer so mightie, neuer so craftie, or neuer so well liked of amongst men, because they are not righteous.
               Then you sée that no infirmitie, no sicknesse, no weaknesse, no simplenesse, no base parentage, no low estate, no miserie, nor affliction, no deuill of hell can make the Lord either to forget or to forsake those, which haue had once the assuraunce of his loue, for whom he loueth he loueth for euer. Therefore if iniquitie come, or if securitie steal
                     •
                   vpon vs, let this doctrine be a staffe to stay vs vp in our integritie▪ if sicknesse come, or pouertie come, or crosses come, or affliction come, nay if all the deuils in hell come, let this doctrine vphold our faith in his promises, which is faithfull for euer,
                  2. Tim. 2.13. 
                  and cannot denie himselfe, let it be a brasen wall to thy

conscience against despaire, let it be a preseruatiue against the infection of sinners, let it be a cordiall for our fainting spirites, let it swéeten all our sorrowes, and swallow vp all our cares. And while we liue, let vs comfort one another with these wordes. It is the Lord that vpholdeth vs in our integritie, and doth set vs before his face for euer, for the wordes are comfortable, and the Lord giue a blessing that they may be profitable. Now let vs pray.
               
            
         
         
            
            THE SIXTH SERMON, December 19. 5. Sabboth.
            
               Blessed be the Lord God of Israell world without end. So be it, euen so be it.
            
            
               THe Prophet Dauid hauing receiued assuraunces of Gods fauour towards him, he prayseth God the giuer. What tokēs he had of Gods loue both without him, and within him, we haue heard in the verses before, of his behauiour after the receipt therof, we shall heare in this last verse. He now returneth to God, for his iewells, such as he had, prayse & thāksgiuing, loue for loue, praises for blessings, as was his duety. The Lord of loue wooeth Dauid his beloued, he hath wōne his affectiō, Dauid is ye Lords, both in body and soule, & in all that he hath, Dauid is happy thereby, for he is samed therby,

but ye Lord is neuer ye richer for his gift. In Dauids thankesgiuing, we may obserue two things, first to whō he offereth his sacrifice of praise: secōdly in what maner he offereth it. For ye first: it is y• Lord to whō he doth offer it, & to none but the Lord. Papistes say, blessed be God, & our Layd, blessed be God, & such a sainct, & such a sainct, for this & ye blessing: so doth not Gods child here, Ergo they are not Gods childrē in so doing. A mā after Gods owne hart doth not so, Ergo they are not men after Gods owne hart in doing so. Great reason had Dauid, & great reasō haue all ye faithfull to prayse God onely: for first, who kept Dauids enemies frō triūphing against him but the Lord? who vpheld him in his integrity, but ye Lord? who set him before his face for euer, but ye Lord? therefore who must be praysed but the Lord? This was ye Lords own doing, & this was ye Lords onely doing, therfore he onely is to be praysed. Again, the Lord which saueth vs euen for his own name sake, wil not haue his glory parted betwéene him & his creatures, but giuen wholly to himselfe, as ye Prophet Esay saith,
                  Esay. 42.8. 
               
                  •
               herfore, cursed be they, whatsoeuer they be, y• dare ioyne any whatsoeuer, as partners wt
               
God, either in his workes or in his worship. For his maner & forme of praising God, it is most excellēt, for he doth it in such wordes & maner as noteth a wōderfull earnest affectiō in him towardes ye Lord, a great zeale of his glorie, great humilitie in him selfe, & a great feare least he should not doe it as he ought: for first, he doth not say simply, blessed be God, but blessed be the Lord God of Israell, to shew that nothing in him selfe deserued such loue at Gods hands, but onely the couenaunt, which ye Lord made, with his Church moued him thereunto, Dauid being a member of the Church. Secondly as Gods loue is infinite and euerlasting, so accordingly he praiseth his name for it, saying, world without end. Thirdly, to shew his hartie, and vnfained cōsent to that, which he spake, he saith. So be it, and as one not repēting him of that he had said, but rather fearing that he came too short in the first, he doubleth his speech, and with a second blow, to rouse vp his hart and affection, which were scant awakened with the first, he saith, So be it, and againe I say So be it, So be it, euen so be it.
            
            The doctrine that is to be gathered from this verse, ariseth two wayes, first from the

matter subiect: secondly, from the forme of ye words. The matter subiect of the verse is Dauids thankesgiuing to the Lord, for that he had so many wayes sealed vp, and made sure his loue vnto his soule. From which example we may gather this general doctrine, that after benefits receiued of God, it is our dutie, and our delight to returne thankes vnto the Lord, if Gods loue be swéete vnto vs. And this dutie can none performe aright but the elect children of God, which are led by Gods spirit, endued with Gods grace, enriched with Gods benefites, and inflamed with his loue. All of vs do begge and craue like lepers, but scarce one of ten do returne praises and thankesgiuing for our healing, as though Gods gifts were not worth thāks. We are not so kinde to the Lord for all his benefites, as we are to a mortall man for one curtesie. Onely the faithfull being once throughly enlightened, and effectually called, are afraid to omit or neglect this dutie, and when they do faile therein, they are not a litle grieued thereat: and that they do, for Gods spirit is in them. Therefore as they pray by the spirit, so by the same spirite they praise God: alwayes knitting vp their prayers

with thankesgiuing, for they must not be separated. Daniell prayed,
                  Dan. 6.10. & praised God thrée times a day on his knées: no doubt he did it oftener as occasion was offred, but this he bound him selfe vnto what businesse soeuer he had, because of his dulnesse: to teach vs what we must do. But how many deuour the graces of God one after another like a hogge vnder the trée, neuer looking vp to the trée from whence they come: as though all that God sendeth were nothing. Some are afraid to be acknowen who did them good, or gaue them goods,
                  Iohn. 9.21. like the blind mans father, who for feare of the Iewes durst not tel who gaue his sonne his sight. Some are ashamed like Sarah,
               
                  Gen. 18.13. who laughed at the Angels message, when she should rather haue giuen thankes: & this is because the wicked mocke the godly for praising of God, as the sonne of the bond woman mocked the sonne of the frée woman, and it is now become a reproch to speake any one word amongst many to the praise of God: whereof it commeth that the most part both at bed and boord do so commonly forget to prayse the Lord, but like beasts they sit and lye down, and like beasts they rise vp againe. But litle may we do beloued,

if we cannot by prayer aske leaue of God to take his blessings, when we haue no right to any thing but in Christ, and litle may we do, if we cannot giue him thanks, & acknowledge him to be the giuer. Thus like théeues we steale the Lords benefites and do nothing for them, as if we should boldly goe into our neighbours house, & take our diner, and his plate, and go away, and neuer say, with your leaue, nor I thanke you: the Lord open our eyes, and touch our hearts. Some that would séeme to be a litle more manerly, will vtter, nay I may more truely say, smother out a few cold words of course, like gossips & protestants at large, when they meete one another, Here is a goodly weather God be praised, Oh you haue a swéete child neighbour, God blesse him, God be thāked of your vpsitting, or your comming abrode againe, and so foorth: but if any thing be added more then these common gratulations, whereby God may reape more glorie, that is a note of a Puritane, and he is too holy for our company. Some would giue God thankes oftener then they do, but they cannot remember him without a picture, or a crucifixe, or some Popish relicke, like the Ioclatrous Iewes,

which could not remember God til they saw a calfe. As though the Lords dayly benefits were not sufficient remembrances & liuely pictures of the Lords goodnesse, or as though when any doth bestow a benefite vpon vs by his sonne, we should not thanke his father because we neuer saw him, and we want his picture.
            Some will for fashion sake giue God a good word or two, and say perhaps, God is a good God, God be blessed, I thanke God for my deliuerance, &c. but then they must run a long discourse of them selues, but if I had not done this and that, if I had not played ye man, & had a good forecast, &c. it had not gone so well with me as it did. Thus many deale with God, like him that when he hath tolde out his money to his creditor which he ought him, and taken vp his bond, snatcheth vp his money againe, and for an hundred pound giueth him a penie and a boxe on the eare. But to leaue all these to the Lord, this is most certaine, if we be afrayd, or ashamed, or forgetfull, or indifferent to praise the Lord: or if we be vnreuerent, or idolatrous, or superstitious in praising God, how can we assure our selues to be the children of God?
            
               But note further in this holy seruant of God, how he was qualified, and prepared, before he would, or before he could offer any sacrifice of praise acceptable to God. First he examineth his heart, and findeth his affectiōs holy, and vpright before the Lord, his heart frée from reuenge, his spirit humbled vnder the hand of God, his soule assured of Gods fauour, and his faith setled in his promises: this being done, he procéedeth and saith Blessed be the Lord God of Israell, &c. assuring him selfe, that when his person is accepted with God, his praises & thankesgiuing shall not be reiected. This is to teach vs, that they which come vnsanctified, and vnprepared by a liuely faith and true repētance, and haue nothing to cōmend them vnto God but their pride, their hatred, their infidelitie, their impietie, and such like, they cannot prayse the Lord, and if they do, it is returned vpō their heads as sinne: & so they are sent away not onely emptie, but in worse case then they came, like the vnworthy guest that came to the Kings feast without his wedding garment. And this doctrine runneth currant thorough the whole body of the Scriptures, and no man doth aske from whence it

commeth or whither it goeth, but euery one of the Lords Seers and seruants giueth testimonie vnto it. The Psalmist is of yt mind, for he saith,
                  Psal. 34.15 16 
               The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open to their crie, but the face of the Lord is against them that do euill, to cut off the remembrance of them from off the earth, to shew how little the Lord regardeth their prayers, or any thing that they can offer vnto his maiestie. Salomon is likewise of the same mind, for he saith,
                  Prou. 15.8. 
               The sacrifice of the wicked is abominatiō to the Lord, but the prayer of the righteous is acceptable vnto him. He sheweth a good reason why. For (saith he) the way of the wicked is abomination to the Lord, but he loueth them that followe righteousnesse. In another place he saith,
                  Prou. 17.7 
               High talke becō
                  meth not a foole. If high talke becometh not a 
                  •
               oole, much lesse doth diuine talke become a wicked man: for what talke hi
                  •
               her thē talke with the most high? and who so foolish as the wicked and profane? The Prophet Esay is also of the same mind, for he (speaking in the person of God) saith thus, When you shall stretch out your hands,
               
                  Esay. 1.15. 
               I will hide mine eyes from you, & though you make many praiers,

I will not heare you, for your handes are full of bloud, that is: your déedes are full of oppression, and therefore your prayers, and praises are stained with your bloudy hands.
            
               S. Luke saith,
                  Luke. 4.41 
               That deuils came out of many, crying and saying, thou art Christ the sonne of the liuing God, but Christ rebuked them, and suffred them not to say that they knew him to be that Christ, because they were deuils. For our Sauiour Christ will not be praised out of a deuils mouth, for their commendation tendeth rather to his discredite thē otherwise: so deuilish men may perhaps come out of many houses, to Church, & cry we prayse thée O God, we know thée who yu art, Iesus the sonne of the liuing God, glory be to the father and to the sonne and to the holy Ghost, and many good wordes and spéeches moe they vtter, but surely the Lord is so farre from accepting any such thing at their hands, that he is more prouoked to anger against them for it, because they are deuilish, and come without repentance into the presence of the most holy. The like in all respectes shall we read of in the 16. of the Actes.
                  Act. 16.17.18. A certaine maid had a spirite of diuination, she was such a one as some ignorantly

call a cunning womā, no better then a witch or a cōiurer, one that wrought by the deuil, & could by helpe of the deuil tell where things were yt were lost, & such a one followed Paul and Silas, crying, These are the seruaunts of the most high God, and this she did many dayes. But Paul being greeued, turned about and said to the spirite, I commaunde thee in the name of Iesus Christ that thou come out of her. Now as Gods seruaunts could not abide the confession of the deuill, much lesse can God him selfe abide it, being onely for feare and not of loue. A straunge thing that deuils, which are at defiāce with God, should confesse him. And yet (all things duely considered) it is not so straunge as it may séeme to be, for what if they do it of constrainte whether they wil or no? or what if it be for feare onely and not for loue? or what if they do it to bring credit vpon their own matters, and to bring Gods matters into contempt? then the strangenesse of the matter is diminished: for indéede this is common not onely among the deuils, but amongest all the reprobate. Sathā shall alledge Scripture to credite his owne cause, and Balam will not (because 
                  •
               e cannot) passe the boundes of that, which God

hath put in his mouth, whē his hart hunteth for ye wages of iniquitie. Sometime to make them inexcusable God will wring a confession from their own mouthes, as he did from Pharao. Sometime the wicked will doe that, which their hart goeth against, to bring Gods seruaunts in question amongest men, like the cunning maide before mentioned. Sometime to deceiue the more easily, and strongly, he will chaunge him selfe into the likenesse of an Angell of light, and put vpon a fowle matter a faire cloake of holinesse. The truth wherof may sufficiently appeare in the kingdome or Poperie, amongest the Monkes and Friers, which vnder pretence of holinesse, commit all kinde of wickednes. I haue knowen some Arian heretiques▪ whose life hath bene most strickt amongest men, whose toungs haue bene tired with Scripture vpon Scripture, their knées euen hardned in prayer, and their faces wedded to sadnesse, and their mouthes full of prayses to God, while in the meane time, they haue stoutly denied the diuinitie of the sonne of God, and haue not sticked to teare out of the Bible, all such places as made against them, such were Hamond, Lewes and Cole heretiques

of wretched memorie lately executed and cut of in Norwich, what shall I say of Fraunces Ket another Arian which succéeded them,
                  F. Kett.
                in opinions more monstrous then his predecessours, for he held that whosoeuer wilbe saued, must before he dye, go to Ierusalē: that Christ with his Apostles, are now personally in Iudea gathering of his church: that ye faithfull should miraculously be preserued at Ierusalem, with a wall of fire, & be fed with Angels foode from heauen: but these were his dreames, & yet such dreames as (rather then he would for go them, hauing once embraced them) caused him to plunge him selfe ouer head and eares in most damnable & cursed heresies, for behold: to maintaine his former fancies, he held most impudently that Christ Iesus is not God, but a good man, as others be, and that which was neuer heard before, that Christ hath suffred once for his own sinnes, and shall (before ye end of the world) suffer again, for the sinnes of the world, and that being done, he shalbe then made God after his secōd resurrection. And yet as monstrous as he was in opiniō, sée how holy he would séeme to be in his outward conuersatiō. The sacred Bible almost

neuer out of his handes, him selfe alwayes in prayer, his toung neuer ceased praysing of God, when he went to the fire he was clothed in sackcloth, he went leaping and dauncing: being in the fire, aboue twentie times together, clapping his handes, he cried nothing, but blessed be God, blessed be God, blessed be God, and so continued vntill the fire had consumed all his neither parts, and vntill he was stifled with the smoke that he could speake no longer: all which I was a witnes of my self. But shall we thinke that the Lord tooke any delight in the prayers or prayses of such a deuill incarnate? farre be it from vs. A straunge and fearefull example of a desperate, of a hardened, and a cursed creature, and yet not to be wondered at, for the deuill hath his souldiers, and martyrs aswell as the Lord, and oftentimes they are more resolute in the deuils quarrell, then some are in Gods quarrel. As for his willing and ready going, with his cōstant enduring, it was no more then is perfourmed by such as hang them selues, or drowne themselues, but what pleasure hath the Lord in the sacrifices of such? What shall we say of our English Donatists, our schismaticall Brownists, &

followers of Barrow and his crue? they hold our Church for no visible Church,
                  Schismatiques.
                neither that we haue so much as a face of a Church amōgst vs: they cōdēne all our assemblies at their pleasure, terming vs & our Churches to be but dunghils, and Sinagogues of Sathan, our Ministerie no Ministerie, our Sacramēts no Sacraments, our teachers they terme Baals Priests, the taile of the red dragon, the whole Church of England, they call Babilon, Sodom, Egipt, & all that naught is, thus they cast mire in ye face of their mother in whose bowels they were first begotten (if euer they were begotten) to the Lord, separating thē selues frō all the holy things of God, because euery thing is not iust as they would haue it. But in the meane time to get more credite vnto their pretended cause of separation, they séeme to be very deuout in prayer, and as though the spirite of prayer were proper vnto them, they condēn
                  •
                all other mens prayers, their mouthes alwayes thundering out the iudgements of God, while they take a felicitie in condemning their brethrē, they come vnder a cloake of sinceritie and reformation, while they go about to plucke vp the Lordes vineyeard by

the rootes, and none more zealous in their profession, none more deuout in praysing of God, none more ready in the Scriptures then they, yea as plentifull in their proofes, and textes of Scripture they séeme to be for vpholding of their errors & shcisme, as Kett was for the defending of his heresies, but what pleasure the Lord hath in such schismaticall prayers & prayses, which haue nothing to present them to the Lord, but a spirite of pride, and errour, I feare to speake, ye Lord open their eyes, to see their sinne, that so many as belong to him may be conuerted and be saued.
            Thus we sée it manifest both by testimonies and examples that the sacrifices of the wicked & vngodly are vile before the Lord, how holy soeuer they séeme to be amongest men, and they can not prayse him, but as the deuils did confesse him. But if any come before the Lord, as his beloued spouse, decked with their garment of diuers colours, I meane their soules clothed with the riches of Gods fauour, as true repentaunce, a liuely faith, brotherly loue, lowlinesse of spirite, integritie of hart, patience in affliction, ioy in the holy Ghost, if any come to the Lord

depending on Gods grace, naked in himself▪ yet clothed in Christ, doubting of himselfe yet assuring himselfe of Gods fauour both promised & purchased in ye bloud of Christ Iesus they may bring their offering, wt 
               Dauid, & say, Blessed be the Lord God of Israell, and the king of glory shall then haue delight in their beautie, for he loueth the prayses of his people, and of none els.
            This doctrine, if it were throughly applied, and closely layd to the conscience of euery estate & calling, it would I hope make vs all more warie, and carefull in offering our selues with our presents of prayses and prayers vnto the Lord while we liue. And first of all, what will Idolaters, and persecuters of Gods Sainctes say vnto this. In a merry note they sing Te Deum laudamus, & Benedictus Deus Israel. &c. But whether such Popish, and bloudy seruices be accepted of God or no, I would wish them to consider.
            In our Church if there be any in ye plate of seers & watchmen ouer the Lords people, and yet haue neither will, skill, nor courage to lead the people of the Lord in the wayes of righteousnesse, and also do wearie them selues in the wayes of loosenesse and prophanesse,

and yet wil come into Gods house, and without repentance offer vp cōfessions, prayers, & thākesgiuings for themselues & the people: how acceptable such sacrifices are vnto the Lord, I would wishe them also to consider.
            Agayne, there are some called Parishe Clarkes, which without any manner of calling thereunto from God, doe intrude them selues into the Ministers office, onely for a litle filthie lucre sake, and most confusedly and disorderly tumble ouer the holy things of God, as the Lordes prayer, with diuers things, which I blush to name, vnder pretence forsooth of helping the Minister to say seruice: a thing which I neuer saw, but in this place. How acceptable the prayers, and seruice of such men are, or rather how detestable it is vnto God, I would they had grace to consider.
            What will hypocrites, and contēners of the word preached, say to this? because they cannot chuse, they come to common prayer, which indéede is too much negelcted, but as for other excercises, of preaching, and Catechising (of all, the most néedefull, & most pro
               
                  ••
               table) they dedicate those times to bowles,

or cardes, or tables, or tipling, or wanton walking, & I know not what, and then the exercises being done they repaire to the ordinary seruice, where they make a fained confession, and prayers, and prayses for custome sake,
                  Pro. 28.9. but, He that turneth his eare frō hearing the law (saith the holy Ghost) euen his prayer shalbe abhominable. If his prayer be abhominable, what is his presumptuous prating, and proude blaspheming? Againe, let pirates and rouers at sea, with vsurers, & oppressours by land, with swearers, drunkardes, filthie liuers, Sabboth prophaners and such like, lay this to their hart, and God in mercy looke vpon them, for their seruice done to God, is as acceptable to his Maiestie as the harlots vowes, and offrings, of which we read in the 7. of the Prouerbes,
                  Pro. 7.14. when she went about to entice vnto follie: or as if they cut of a dogges head for the Lord. Againe, if there be any husbands and wiues, or any neighbours, liuing in discord, and suffering their harts to boyle in hatred one against another, how can they thinke that the Lord wilbe delighted with their wrathfull prayers, and prayses, when they doe offer them, what should I say more? I would

wish, and I do earnestly desire, that euery one would lay it to his hart, & to consider wt him selfe: first, what a sinne it is not to pray, and praise God at all: next, how the sinne is encreased, if they be not prepared and sanctified before they do blesse God, as Dauid was: for the sacrifices of the wicked are like the salutations of the Iewes, when they bowed the knée vnto Christ, and spit in his face together.
         
         
            THE SEVENTH Sermon, December 26.
            
               Blessed be the Lord God of Israell. &c.
            
            
               THe last Sabboth day, we heard, that Dauid hauing receiued assuraunces of Gods fauour towardes him, returned prayse and thankes vnto the Lord for it: & how he was prepared thereunto we also heard then declared at large, we will now

consider and sée in what manner and forme he praysed God.
            First let vs consider why he saith, not simply, Blessed be the Lord, but blessed be the Lord God of Israel. In these wordes be two points to be obserued. First, the cause why God loued him. Secondly, the largenesse, and the greatnesse of Gods loue. But first, of the cause why God loued him, and why he did so assure him of his loue & fauor. And that was not, I warrant you, any worthinesse that ye Lord found in Dauid, nor for his friēds sake, nor for his coūtrey sake, nor for his vertues sake, but onely for his couenaūt sake, which the Lord made with his Church, wherof Dauid was a member, & therefore must néedes haue his part amongest ye rest, because God had so promised. Blessed be the Lord God of Israell. As if he should say, I giue the Lord prayse, & thankes, which hath chosē Israel, to be his people, which were not his peeple, and hath boūd him self, by promise to be ye God of Israel, & to watch ouer his people, & to assure thē of his fauor, which deserued 
                  ••
               thing but his wrath & displeasure, for by this meanes I am now assured of his loue, and fauor towards me, which I should neuer haue had if

the Lord had not chosen me to be one of thē, vpō whō he meant to bestow his loue, according to his gracious promise, which he made to my fathers Abrahā, Isaac, & Iacob (which was afterwardes called Israell:) and according to his promise which he made, not onely to them, but also to all their séede, that is to all the faithful, so hath he delt with his seruaunts, blessed & praysed be his name for it.
            Now we sée the fountaine from whence springeth all the good that we haue, blessed is Israell, because the Lord is their God, and blessed is England, because the Lord is our God. By this we may sée what an excellent thing it is to be of the Church of God, for thē the Lord Iehouah, the Lord almightie, is our God, and we are his people, and if he be on our side, who can be against vs? or if any be against vs, who cā preuaile against vs? then are we in safetie from our enemies, then are we vpholden in our integritie, and prouided for according to our wants. So that the Lord doth not saue vs, nor helpe vs because we deserue it, but because he hath so promised in Christ Iesus, neither doth he chuse vs, because he saw some goodnesse in vs, but therfore is his goodnes, & grace bestowed vpō vs,

because he hath first elected and chosen vs to be his people. But now sée what a thing it is to be of the Church of God, that is of the companie of Gods people, and within the cōpasse of Gods couenaunt.
                  Psal. 87.2. 
               The Lord loueth the the gates of Sion, that is, the gates of his Church, more then all the habitations of Iacob, to shew how he loueth his Church, for if he beareth such affection to the gates, what affection doth he beare to the Citie? If he loueth the most inferiour, euen the porters of his Church, that are set to kéepe the gates, what doth he for the chief Citizens, the common wealth of Israell? no maruell though Dauid desired to be a doore kéeper in ye house of God, for to be such a one, yea, to be the meanest in Gods Church, is to be the beloued of the Lord at the least, & that whē it is at the least, is greater then all ye pleasures, & treasures of the earth, yea it is better then wine,
                  Cant. 1.1. saith the spouse of Christ, in the Canticles: that is, better then all pleasures & profites in the whole world. But what doth he for his Church? sée what he doth, God is knowē in Iudah,
               
                  Psal. 76.1. (saith ye Psalmist) his name is great in Israel as if he should say, god hath made his will, and his counsels knowen to his Church, & the heathē haue not the knowledge

of his wayes. The godly are of his coūsell as Abraham was, and is this a small matter?
                  Psal. 147. But see yet more. In Shalē is his tabernacle, & his dwelling is in Zion, as if he should say, the dwellings of ye Lord they are in peace,
                  Psal. 76.5. for Shalem is peace. There brake he the arrowes, and the bow, the shield, and the sword, & the battaile. The stoute harted are spoiled, they haue slept their sleepe, and all the men of strength haue not founde their handes. At thy rebuke ô God of Iacob, both the chariot, and the horse are cast a sleepe, & therefore, because thou art the God of Iacob, for he is so tender ouer his Church, that he will not abide any to annoy, or molest his Church, except it be for ye greater good of his Church, & the further, & greater confusion of their enemies. Whō shall we now praise for our deliuerance? we recken our ships, & giue them high prayses, we vse to say in the forgetfulnes of Gods goodnes, we may thanke such a ship, such a thing, and such a meanes & so forth, but we should say, Blessed be the Lord God of Israell: for it is he that wilbe, and must be knowen in his Church.
            Whom haue we to stād by vs, if euer our enemies come againe, but the Lord God of

Israell? Let vs say thē as the Psalmist saith, God is our hope and strength,
               
                  Psal. 46.1. 
               and helpe in troubles ready to be found.
               2. 
               Therfore will we not feare though the earth be moued. Some will say, we haue ships at sea, the hope, the reuenge, the dread nought, and so forth, nay, God is our hope, God is our reuenge, & God is dread naught indéede.3. 
               Though the waues of the sea be troubled, and rage, and the moū
                  taines shake at the surges thereof.
               4. 
               Yet there is a riuer, whose streames shall make glad the Citie of God, euen the sanctuarie of the Tabernacles of the most high.
               5. 
               God is in the midst of it, therfore it cannot be moued.
               6. 
               The Lord of hostes is with vs,
               7. 
               the God of Iacob is our refuge. Now marke what followeth. Come,
               8. 
               and behold the workes of the Lord, what desolatiōs he hath made vpō the earth. He maketh warre to cease,
               9. 
               he breaketh the bow, and cuts the speare, and burneth the chariots in the fire. Now heare what ye Lord himselfe saith.10. 
               Be still (saith he) & know that I am God, I wilbe exalted among the heathen, and I wilbe exalted in the earth. In the next verse they doe exalt him,11. saying. Th
                     •
                   Lord of hostes is with vs, the God of Iacob i
                     •
                   our refuge. Noting, nothing to be the caus
                  •
               
               
of all these workes, but onely his couenant which he made with his Church. In the first of S. Luke this is plaine.
                  Luke. 1.54 55. 
               He hath vpholdē Israel his seruant, being mindeful of his mercy. As he hath promised to our fathers Abrahā and his seede for euer. The virgine Marie is of the same minde.
                  Luke. 1.71 
               He hath sent vs deliueraunce (saith she) from our enemies, and from the handes of all that hate vs, but the cause thereof was his mercy, which he shewed to our fathers in remembring his holy couenaunt, and the othe which he sware to our father Abraham, not mentioning any thing in her selfe. Therefore, whensoeuer we stād in néede of the Lordes helpe (as we do continually) let vs be sure that we are the Israell of God, and then claime his promise, and let vs not then doubt,2. Tim. 2.13. for he is faithfull, and cannot denie him selfe. And so much for the cause yt moued God to be so good vnto Dauid.
            
            The second thing that I obserue in these wordes is the large extēt of Gods loue. For, therfore doth the Prophet call him the Lord God of Israell, to shew yt God is not a God of one onely, but of all ye faithfull to the end of the world. He was not onely Dauids God, but he is our God also, or els perhaps, some

might say, Oh Dauid was an excellent man, and a man after Gods owne hart, and God did assist him wonderfully. But God is the same God to vs, that he was to Dauid, and will assist vs as mightely as he did Dauid, if we call vpon him as Dauid did. Yea to euery one of vs he is the same, for God is no accepter of persons, not the Iewes more then the Gentils, the wall of separation being pulled downe,
                  Gal. Act. 10.34 35. 
               But in euery nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousnesse is accepted with him. Whosoeuer is a right Israelite is such a one as feareth God, and whosoeuer feareth God is a right Israelite: therefore when Iesus saw Nathaniell, he said, Behold indeede an Israelite, in whom is no guile, therfore he that feareth God, and is without guile, is an Israelite indéed, that is one of Gods children indéede, what a comfort is this to all the faithfull, though they be neuer so poore, and base in the sight of men, yet God is their God, they being his people, and they may chalēge his promise aswell as any other, and God will surely heare them, and they shall say, Blessed be the Lord God of Israell.
            
            Now are we to cōsider of the next words,

why he saith, world without end. He doth not praise God so long as the benefit of deliuerance lasteth, and no longer, but so long as his mercy endureth, and that is for euer: for it hath pleased the Lord to chuse vnto him selfe a Church and a kingdome, out of Angels and men, which neuer shall haue end, and those shall praise him continually, as well for his iudgements as for his mercies. And this is it that S. Iohn set downe by the spirit of prophecie,
                  Apoc. 19.1.2. when he saith, I heard a great voyce of a great multitude in heauen, saying, Halleluiah, saluation, and honor, and glorie, and power be to the Lord our God, for true & righteous are his iudgements. We vse to say, if a mortall man doth shew vs any curtesie, or bestow any benefit vpon vs, Oh giue him great thankes, but how great thanks, and what presents shall we offer to God, who gaue it him first, and gaue him a heart to giue, & giueth for euer? If a Prince should send vs any thing (were it neuer so litle) for a remembrance, we will thanke him according to the worthinesse of his person, & not according to the value of the thing which was sent. But God is the Prince of al Princes, and he giueth more then trifles, for

in him we liue, and moue, and haue our being, and he hath giuen vs his Sonne, who hath purchased a kingdome for vs which shal neuer haue end. And if it were but our bare being here, he were to be praised for euer: how much more for such, and so many benefits, as can neither be numbred, nor valued? Yea for his infinite wisedome, which he hath caused to shine in all his works of creation: if we consider but the excellent wisedome of God in a poore litle flie, he is to receiue infinite praises for the same. How much more for his infinite goodnesse, power, mercie, iustice and prouidence ouer all his creatures, and his vnspeakeable loue towards his children in his couenant of grace?
            If a sily man shall frame a cunning péece of worke, or do some notable exploite, or accomplish some hard & great péece of seruice, which yet he could not do of him selfe, it is oftentimes presented to the Prince, & published to his lasting praise and renowne: but who is comparable with the Lord of hostes, whose curious and cunning workemanship appeareth in all his creatures, and whose right hand hath the preheminence, by doing of valiant things? shall not his name then

be published to his euerlasting praise in his Church and congregation of his saincts? By this appeareth what difference there is betwéene our God, and the false gods of ye heathen: for who doth or can do such things as our God doth, who hath his being, and all sufficiencie of him selfe, and all others haue nothing but as he giueth vnto them? who deserueth euerlasting praises but our God? By this it likewise appeareth, what dishonor and disgrace haue bene offred by grosse Idolaters, which wold take vpon them to paint and picture out the inuisible, and incomprehensible maiestie of the Almightie, like a mā whose breath is in his nostrels, whose being is not of him selfe, whose yeares are but a span long, & in his best estate is altogether vanitie.
                  Col. 3. 
               What so euer ye do (saith the Scripture) do all to the glorie of God. That is, striue to do it so, as God may get most glory by it. Are such representations of God, to the aduancing of his glorie? what do they shew and teach vs that we might giue him euerlasting praises for? he is painted as a man, as you sée in yonder storie of the creation,
                  In S. Tho. Church of Bristol.
                in yonder window, in a dozen places together: what may we learne by them? A man hath

his being from another, if God be as he is painted foorth, he hath so too, which to say, is blasphemie. A man hath father and mother, but who was the Lords father, & his mother? A man is first a babe, and afterward groweth in knowledge, shall we thinke the Lord to be such? A man hath neede of meate and drinke and apparel, and of tutors and counsellers, and many things mee, but who was the Lords draper or puruayour, or counseller at any time? O cursed creatures that euer first inuented them, and cursed wretches that dare maintaine them, if God giue them not repentance: for they are such abhominations as God hath flatly forbidden, and condemned to the pit, yea to the very bottomlesse pit of hell. Are these the pictures of him that is to be praised world without end? if they be not, why are they not defaced, which do so much deface the glorie of our Creator? if they be not, why are they tollerated? nay if they be not, why are they defended as lawfull, and not hurtfull to any? and that euen now (with shame inough) in the cléere light of the Gospell? And if they be not, why should any kéepe such a stirre, and be so out of patience and charitie with the minister of

the Lord Iesus, for speaking against such filthie and damnable abominations? The Lord open these mens hearts, and giue them repentance if it be his will: and so much be spoken for that point.
            
               So be it, euen so be it. These wordes do shew the agréement of his mind, and consent of his heart to that which he saide with his tongue, to teach vs, that in Gods seruice we must neither doubt of that which we do, nor wauer in the perfourming of our vowes, neither must we do it fainedly, but with ful consent of heart and mind. Resolution is the thing indéed that we are here taught. Resolution in Gods matters is very requisite, as it is for a souldier in the field: for Christian souldiers shall haue many assaults to make them retire. For want whereof many leaue their standing, and run after the world as Gehezi left his masters house, and ran after Naman for gifts, till the leprosie caught him. A Christian without it, is like a doore without a locke, soone open and soone shut, for all commers, open with Agrippa till Christianitie be almost come in, and that is iust nothing, and shut with Festus, that Paule must stand without like a mad man. Hereof it

cometh that many haue lost their first loue, some are neither hote nor cold, some betake them selues with Demas to ye present world, some are for all companies, and are of all religions, and so are of no religion: and most men are like réedes shaken with the winde, when as they which are resolute in Gods matters, go constantly through all assayes, and stand stedfastly like mount Sion which endureth for euer. Therefore Dauid hauing set downe his mind, sets his hand, and his heart vnto it. So be it (saith he) euen so be it, as if he should say, I am wel aduised of that I haue said, I doubt not of it but that it is truth, and I know it is my dutie, and therefore as I haue sayd, so I say againe, So let it be. But wilt thou stand to it Dauid whatsoeuer come of it? Yea that I will (saith he) & do not repent me of it, and therefore I am so farre from recanting of it, that I spake it, & I do speake it againe, Blessed be the Lord God of Israell world without end. So be it, euen so be it. There be thrée things in man must agrée together in the seruice of God, the tongue, the eare, and the heart: if all these agree vpon the matter, the bill passeth: if all these be in tune, the harmonie is swéete an
                  •
               
               
the musicke pleasant. In euery man that cō
               meth to heare the word of God preached, or to offer vp prayers to God, is a kinde of Parliament holden, & much a doe there is many times to haue bills passe, because all these do not agrée vpō the matter. Gods Minister in Gods name propoūdeth many things to the people,
                  A Parliament.
                the equitie wherof he groundeth vpō ye word of God, & of all these billes, some cō
               cerne God himselfe, & some concerne our selues, & our neighbour. These billes come first to the lower house, yt is to ye outward sences, for first the eare heareth what the matter is: then the eye peruseth the bill, & searcheth the statutes of God in his word, to sée how they agrée together: frō thence they passe along to the higher house, that is to the vnderstāding, from vnderstanding to reason, if reason like of the matter, then it cōmeth to the will, & affections of the hart, when it cōmeth there, if the spirite of God be in the hart then is the hart framed & counselled by the same, if the hart likes of it, the will doth like of it too, thē is the toung sent backe with his answere frō the inward house, to signifie so much to God and the world: then aske ye toung, what saith the hart? the toung as the common speaker

saith, So be it. On the contrary side, if any thing go against reason, then vnderstanding can no skill of it, ye hart forbiddes it, the toūg is silent, & So be it smothered. Many times a thing passeth through all to the hart, where the matter is debated betwéene natural reason & the hart, & there (for want of Gods spirite to countermaund naturall reason) it stayeth, & vnderstāding can no skil of it. But what saith the toung? In stead of So be it, he brings this answere, Sir, ye hart hauing cō
               sulted with worldly pollicie & naturall reason, doth finde this to be against his profit, or against his pleasure, or against his gaine, or against his custome, or against his credite in the world, & therefore this bill cannot passe: my master the hart, with reason, and pollicie do therefore desire you to be contented & speake no more of this matter, but of something els that may stand better with their liking, as for the rest of the house, vnderstā
               ding, will, & affectiō, although they know the matter to be true, iust & equal which you demaund, yet they can do no good in the matter, because the other two haue nipped it in the head. Sometime the toung saith Amen to that which the hart condemneth, because

reason confirmeth it, & this is cōmonly when the eye séeth some body whom he feareth, or the eare heareth something that he cānot answere, & therfore though ye toung be a cōmon speaker, yet is he not alwayes a true speaker. Sometime againe the eare admitteth, & the hart affecteth, & desireth that which reasō subscribeth vnto, but for wāt of faith, reason reuoketh, ye hart fainteth, & ye toūg foltreth, and either for feare, or for shame dareth not vtter what is agréed vpō within. A miserable Parliamēt, yt hath such a speaker, but this is ye matter indéed. This house hath two doores, at one doore ye billes are brought in, & that is by the eare and the eye, at another doore they passe out againe with their answeres & that is the lips within, at which the cōmō speaker stādeth. Now if ye Lord do set a watch there, & kéepe the doore of our lippes, then they are opē, & the toung doth boldly confesse ye truth, but if the fearefull deuill, or the bashfull deuill kéepe the doore, the toūg durst not for his life speake the truth: God in mercy remoue such porters, yt we may boldly confesse with our toūgs, that which we beléeue in our hart to saluatiō. So likewise in prayer, & thākesgiuing, if our toung doth speake any thing,

which the vnderstanding is ignorant of, and therfore the hart cannot affect, our sacrifices are but a mockerie against God, because the Parliament house is deuided, & there is but a mutinie betwéene the hart, the toung, and the rest, but if all agrée vpon the point, thē the toung sheweth the consent of the hart, and boldly without feare of any whatsoeuer stā
               deth forth and saith. So be it.
            
            But why doth he double his speech & say So be it, euen So be it? it should séeme that the speaker of the Parliamēt house, is but a simple man, & wanted matter, he meant well it may be, but for want of matter he is faine to harpe vpō one string much. Surely beloued, ye Prophet spake as he was moued by ye holy Ghost, & this is Gods wisedome, therfore let vs not finde fault withall, this is ye plaine, & simple dealing of a faithful soule indéede. It is vsuall in the Scripture to haue one thing oftentimes vrged in teaching, & no oftener then is néedefull: because, first it is long before we can learne Gods will, secondly it is lōger before we can remēber Gods wil, but principally, because it is lōgest of all before we can make a cōscience to obey Gods wil: therfore let no man in hearing one thing often,

be wearie, because euery mā may learne the same thing better: do not say, the preacher wants matter, but say rather that we want grace, or vnderstanding, or memorie, or zeale, or loue, or something. Againe, let no man in teaching stand so much vpon his reputation, as to compte it a disgrace vnto him if he doth often repeate one thing being necessarie, for we sée it is Gods wisedome to teach so, & if any man wilbe wiser thē Gods spirite, he will proue him selfe a foole. In prayer also the same spirit hath taught Gods childrē to speake one thing oftētimes, partly because there is in euery one great dulnes & want of féeling, & partly to note how earnest they are & desirous to obtaine yt, which they pray for. So doth Dauid here in this place say So be it, euen so be it, as though his hart had bene scarce awake at the first. A mā that would faine haue a thing, which he néedeth indeede, will say (being asked if he will haue it) oh yea, yea, yea, & if it be a thing that he cannot away withall he will say, oh no, no, no, often together, as if he could not deny it too often, as the first could not desire it too much. This may the Church do, if their harts be touched with their owne wants & weakenesses.

But this doth not serue to maintaine any idle, & vnnecessarie repetitions, such as were vsed in Popery, & condēned by our Sauiour Christ in the Scribes & Pharisies.
                  Math. 6. In Popery they bable one thing oftētimes, Iesus, Iesus, Iesus, & you must say ouer the Lordes prayer so many, and so many times together, and then you shall be heard, (say they). And so they play in their chaunting, & curious singing, which is more like the hunting of ye fore, thē any spiritual & holy seruice of God, they are sometime a quarter of an houre almost in singing some one word. Alas poore soules: they thinke yt God is delighted as man is, & they thinke that the Lord is a sléepe, as Baals Priests thought, & therfore they call often, but Gods children féele their owne harts a sléepe, & therfore it is that they cry often in the same wordes.
            
               So be it, euen so be it, saith the holy Prophet, as if he should say, did I speake it? I will say it againe, I doe not repent me of it, I am not afrayde, I am not ashamed, if I said it not with such féeling the first time as I ought, I will say it againe. To shewe how carefull, how constant, how bold, and how holy we should be in praysing of God.

For many times in our prayers our mindes are crossed with one thing or other, so that God hath not the hart, thē to it againe, Hart what sayest thou? then So be it, euen so be it. Some thinke a cold word, vnreuerently blustred out, to be good inough for God, and are ashamed to amend any thing if it be amisse, and afrayde to stand to a thing if it be well. Some will vtter in table talke, whatsoeuer commeth in their mindes of God, & against him too sometime, & when they should either defēd it, or deny it, or reforme it, they turne it away with a iest: Nay sir, it is not my profession, I will not reason of it, nor stand with you in it, you are to hard for me, this is but table talke, and if there should be no arguing & disputing, how should mē come by knowledge? &c. But sée their folly, or their weakenesse at the least, if it be true, & expedient, defend it for Gods glory, if it be false recant it to the shame of the deuill, if it be doubtfull, be instructed, for thy further comfort. But Gods children are well aduised what they say, & being so, they are not ashamed nor afrayde, if they heare of it agayne, but as they said it, so they will say it again. So be it, euen so be it.
            
            
               This earnest and reuerent kinde of giuing thankes doth also notably reproue the prophanesse of some, who while thanks be offred vp to the Lord at Table, for nourishment receiued, they are otherwise busied, looking here, and there, toying with one thing or other, according to the affection of their hart. And when grace is done, they will not stand with you, for Amen, but it shalbe so snatchingly, and so shackled in the teeth and lippes, that it would leath a man to heare it, which they would not do if they thought the Lord worthie of thankes for his benefites: but so they doe, as if he were not worthie of one cold word, and if he get any more, then they are at very great cost with him, and he must néedes be indebted to them for it: but Gods children come with great feare and reuerence, and to that which is said they giue their hartie consent in most reuerent manner. So be it, euen so be it.
            
            Furthermore the person of Dauid may teach vs one thing more, for he being the King, giueth thankes to God him selfe: to teach vs that it is an excercise for Kings and Princes: but now most men set their litle children to doe it onely, and are ashamed to

do it them selues, as though it were a childish thing to giue God prayse for his blessings. Say not now (as some haue said) yt I would not haue children say grace, yes I would haue you traine them vp in it, els whē they come to yeares they wilbe as much ashamed of it, as their fathers are now. But I would haue your selues to be the principall actours in so holy an action, because you haue the best vnderstanding, & if thou sayest no more but God be praysed for all his giftes, doe it with reuerence, and from the féeling of thy hart in faith and true repentaunce. But if thou wilt be ashamed to giue thy child so good an example, & lay all vpon him, it may be said, thy child is come to grace, but thou art past grace. Last of all, as the king giueth thankes in his owne person, so in his owne person he confirmeth it, and saith, Amen, or So be it: he hath not a Clarke to say Amen for him, as they haue in Poperie, where the Priest, must pray, and the Clarke must say Amen for all the rest of the people. God said to Moses, the Leuites shall pronounce the curses,
                  Deut 27.15.26. and all the people shall say Amen, if at the curses, much more at the blessings must all the people say Amen, for

the one is against them selues, and the other is for them selues. In the primitiue Church, when the Minister had made any prayer in his Sermon, or before, or after. All the people (saith an auncient father) did say Amen, Amen, that the noyse went vp as a mightie thunder in the skies. Now if we speake of a thing that is waightie indéede, & say God graunt it, not ten amongest a thousand, will say Amen, but we will consider of the matter first, & fo we sit as blockes not one whit moued with the matter, and this is a great sinne▪ Againe, at publicke prayer, the people ought to attend to the wordes of the Minister when he prayeth, and all at once, as one body to say Amen. The Clarke hath no more warrant to doe it for them, then Vzzah had to hold vp the Arke from falling, for him selfe with the rest he ought to say Amen, but not alone for the rest, for not be, but the Minister is ye mouth of God, vnto the people, and the mouth of the people vnto God in prayer, but they must say, So be it.
            
            Now to end, God doth now exhibite a Bill vnto vs his people, requiring that whatsoeuer he shall demaund at our hands,

if we sée it standes with his glorie and our owne saluation, we will giue our consent and let it passe, or els the time will come that we shall put vp our Supplications to him, and they shall not passe. God graunt vs grace, to graunt our consent to all his will.
            FINIS.
