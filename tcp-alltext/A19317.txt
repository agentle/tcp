            ¶Prologus of Robert Copland the auctor.
            
               AT Brentforde on ye west of London
               Nigh to a place that called is Syon
               Ther dwelt a widow of a holy sort
               Honest in substance & full of sport
               Da
                     •
                  ly she could with pastime and Iests
               Among her neighbours and her guests
               She kept an Inne of right good lodging
               For all estates that thither were comming
               It chaunced this widow as it is supposed
               In her sporte and merily disposed
               After her death for a remembrance
               Thought to haue some matter of pastance
               For p

                  ople to laughe at in such company
               As are disposed for to talke merily
               Mingled with many proper scoffes & boords
               Of sundry tauntes with some me
                     •
                  y wordes
               The which I haue heard at many seasons
               Full of pastime with prety reasons
               For yf any did a thing ouerthwart
               They saide euer ye shall haue a fart
               Of Iyll of Brantford for your paine
               The which laying oft troubled my brayne
               For I neuer kn
                     •
                  w what the matter was
               Nor could the meaning bring to passe
               Till at the last vpon a day
               I met on Iohn hardlesay
               A mery felow in ech company
               Which said Copland thou lookest dry
               The truthe quod I is as ye say
               For I drank not of al this day
               
                  And of a short tale to make an end
               to the red lyon at the shambles end
               We went for to drink good ale
               and as he was telling his tale
               I offered him for to drink first
               Copland quoth he art thou a thirst
               And biddeth me afore the to drink
               to my iudgement I do think
               Of Iyll of Brentforde worthy thou art
               by her bequest to haue a fart
               And truly now is come to my mynde
               not long ago how I did finde
               An olde scrow all ragged and rent
               beseming it is some mery entent
               As diuers say that do it reed
               but gallant toyes ther semes indeed
               It is Antick, broken / and so raced
               that all the cheef is clene defaced
               Take it and I pray the hartely
               looke theron and if thou espy
               That it be of any substance
               of mirth or of honest pastaunce
               And where thou spiest that it dooth want
               or where for lack the matter is scant
               Put to it as is according
               to the matter in euery thing
               Keep it with thee, and take sum payne
               the poore mare shall haue his man again
            
            
               ¶ Whan I came home, at leisure
               My hart not parfitly at pleasure
               
                  For the losse of a certain freend
               As God knowes few be to finde
               For recreation I it toke
               to pas the time theron to loke
               And of troth oft in the reding
               it did stir me to fall on smiling
               Considering the prety pastime
               and rydicle order of the rime
               The couert termes, vnder a mery sence
               shewing of many the blinde insolence
               Taunting of things past and to come
               where as my self was hit with some
               And for that cause I did intend
               after this manner to haue it pend
               Praying all them that mery be
               if it touch them not to blame me

               She made him cheere of her meat and drink
               
                  That doon she said, this is mine intent
               That you as now shall write my testament
               For I doo feel that age dooth me oppresse
               Good is to haue all thing in redinesse

                  equeth to our Lord almight
               He hath it made, it is his owne then he hath it bought, it is his be right
               In heauen to be in the eternall light and to the earth I bequethe my body
               It is his owne I can it not deny
            
            
               My sinnes all I commit to the Deuil let him take them with him to hell
               For he was the causer of all mine euill
               My goodes to the world of I doo wel
               For they be his I can it not expell

               Saue fame & name I leaue nothing certain
            
            
               Now vnto my freends, reason is I should haue a singuler aspect by nature
               I giue vnto them all that they holde

               But now good sir I pray you for to take

               Lest that with throng my almes should cease
            
            
               Now ye haue drunk ones good ghostly father

               I thank God, I am wel eased now
               
                  Lo there is my greef gon and past
               I wist wel that it would not long last
               I pray you all for to be mery
               I giue it among this company
               For to make you some cheer with all
               For I tel you mine executors shall
               Neuer haue all by God I swere
               I wil deale while I am here
               Now and than, where as I list
               By Christe I tell you, I haue a chest
               Ful that shall be open while I liue
               Secretly and openly for to giue
               I shall haue inough / I wil not them spare
               As wel for other, as mine owne welfare
               Whan I am dead they that come after me
               Shall dele the rest, at their necessitie
               Therfore as now, this is sufficient
               As concerning this said Testament
               To subscribe your names it shall not skil
               For I make it but a copy of a wil
               As touching the choyce of mine executours
               Of my funeralles / and suruciours
               And other trifles ye shall not take the paines
               Another time whan it comes in my braines
               It shall be ordered after such a sort
               That some shall not take it as a sporte
               But neighbours I pray you be not angry
               Because that I am to bolde and homly
               To keep you heere at my foolish reason
               Some wil think my wittes be geson
               But yet I tell you that all this season
               We haue neither said herely nor treason
               
                  And if they take it neuer so at harts
               I wis it is but a bequest of farts
               Willed to them that with out aduisement
               Doo that thing where they repent
               Therfore I wil you no longer trouble
               What maid, come hither I shrew your neck
               Bring vs vp shortly a quart of Seck
               a cuple of Bunnes and set vs some cheese
               Lo freends, ye shall not all your labour leese
               I haue as now no better cheer to make you
               Be mery and welcome, to God I betake you
            
            Finis.
         
         
            
               
            
         
         
            
            ¶ The auctor
            WHen ye company was all passed & gon
            And ye curate with maistris Iil alone
            maistres ꝙ he, if it be your plesance
            ye know it is ye custome & ordinance
            Of them that write a deed indenture or Bil
            That it is or right, reson and skil
            Some recompence of labour for to haue
            Giue what ye lust, for I wil not craue
            By our Lady quod she, that is but wel said
            What Iohan Howe / come hither maid
            Go call the company again to me
            For I haue to say / two woords or three
            Whan they came, she said neighbours I pray
            you beare record what I doo say
            I sent for you / for a certain purpose
            which a fore you I did disclose
            The trueth is so, after the same rate
            I did send also for maister Curat
            To write the same my simple Testament
            Now indeed, as is conuenient
            He dooth aske for his labour therfore
            indeed, because he made no bargain before
            And dooth put it to my conscience
            Truely this shall he haue for a recompence
            And because afore hand he knew not my minde
            he shall not finde me to him vnkinde
            A fart and a half / I wil giue him no les
            nor no more this is of my gentlenes
            For be ye woorketh vnknowing what to haue
            Not half a fart is woorthy for to craue
            
               And beside that, a hood full of bels
            why quod the preest, get I nothing els
            Than to the deuil, I giue whole fart half & all
            nay take it thy self, foolish sir hoball
            Sir Iohn whipdok, sir Iak whipstock
            Sir Iohn smelsmock, as wise as a woodcok
            A hedge Curat, with asmuch wit as a Calf
            To sit so long for a fart and a half
            But to prooue your braines to be thinner
            Or euer ye go / pay for your dinner
            This she railed as her manner was to iest
            and so without farwel lost her dayly gest
            Finis.
            ¶ Thus endeth Iyll of Brainfords testament containing xxvi. farts and a half.
         
      
      
         
            ¶ An exhortation.
            
               My maisters I pray you all that shall reed
               Or heare this little prety fantasy
               Passing foorth meryly in it to proceed
               The manner how for to dele moste egally
               This half fart, truely for to try
               That the Curat, for his parte be not denyed
               Of the fart and the half, and let the rest ly
               and who shall haue ye half amōg you to be tried
            
            
               In this matter if you doo agree
               Who shall haue this half fart, say ye?
