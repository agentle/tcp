            BY JOHN KINGE Doctor of Divinity, and Deane of Christ-Church in Oxon.
            AT OXFORD, Printed by Joseph Barnes Printer to the Vniversitie. 1607.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               8. Cantic. 11.
               Salomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon: he gaue the vineyard vnto keepers: every one bringeth for the fruit thereof a thousand pieces of Silver.
            
            I Remember a difference theyHieron. make of the three bookes of Salomon according to their subiectes, three severall sciences or disciplines, that lead man to his blisse; the first wherof is Morall, the second Naturall, the third Theoricall and Supernaturall.
            
            1 In his Proverbs, because of the precepts and institutes of good life, they obserue Ethickes.
            
            2 In Ecclesiastes, because of the search and knowledge of causes, and distinction of substances from shaddowes and vanities, Physickes.
            
            3▪ Lastly in his booke of the Canticles, they consider Metaphysickes; wherin is a sacred

For that Salomon in his proper person the first and best knowne by the name of Salomon, had a vineyard in proper tearmes without any metaphor, or translation; and seated in Baal-hamon, whither you make it a proper name as Heshbon, and Engaddi, and other vineyards in the booke of God, or whether cō

            Who then is this Salomon? or what this vineyarde? what this Baal-hamon? These Keepers? this fruit? this rent? who and what are they?
            
               Salomon is not Salomon the King of Israell▪ but the King of Kinges: not Salomon from the earth earthlie, but Salomon from heauen heauenly, he that in theBernar. ser. 27, in. Cantic. Gospell is more then Salomon, vs

                  etur. The Salomon whom I meane is so rightly a Salomon, that he is not only a peacemaker, but very peace it selfe. Salomon is Christ.
            
            The vineyard is his Church, a metaphor wel known in the scriptures, were it a stranger vnto you, I would lead you into acquaintance vvith it throughout the whole booke of God. But it is not so, vinea intelligibilis, an intellectual, mystical vineyard is his Church: planted by Gods right hand, grounded in faith, rooted in charity, watered by the word of the preachers, digged and manured by the discipline of Magistrates, the vvine whereof hath the sauour and tast of a good conscience within, the colour and cute of an holy cō
               versation without, and the winepresse by which it rū
               neth abroad, is the tongue of open and thankeful confession to the praise of God.

                  ron. And their office is, 2. Tim. 4. Argue, increpa improue, rebuke, there is putatio, pruning of the vine; but withall obsecra intreat, there is plantatio planting. To be short, Paul is a planter, Apollos is a waterer; and al the rest are 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , some way or other labourers with God in husbanding this vineyard.
            The fruit of a vineyard is the bloud of the grape. This is fructus nativitatis, Psal. 107. The true natiue fruit of it. The vine shal speake for her selfe from that parable, Iud. 9. & tell you what her fruit is: Vinum laetificans Deum & homines, wine that gladdeth both God
               
               and men. (Vinū laetitiae, not luxuriae: nor libidinis, wine
               Bern. 
               of comfort, and gladnes, not of excesse.) It may be Vinum moestificans some times, wine of sorrow. Mark the parable. The Oliue hath her fatnes, the figtree her sweetnes alone, those be their qualities: but est vineae quaedam acrimonia & seueritas, wine must be somewhat tart, as well as pleasant: Coniungi debent suavitas
               Ser. 60. in. Cantic. 
               & seueritas: Sweetnes and sharpnes must be ioined togither. As necessarie it is at times to heare the voice of the Church condemnantem, condemning, as consolā tem, comforting, and reposcentem, requiring, exacting the duties of christianity, as ignoscentem, pardoning faults & defaults, which she shalespie: at some times to feele her hand, plectentem, smiting, as wel as amplectētem, embracing at some others. Ther must be both manna, and vtrga in the arke, bread for refection, and a rod for correction, osculum and fraenum, a kisse for freinds, a bridle for refractary and stubburne persons. I named it planting and pruning before: there must be both doctrine and discipline, else is 'there wanting one of the two principall pillers, that the Church should stand vpon.
            Shall I say in a word what this fruit of the vineyard is? Go to the parable once more. Vinum quod l
                     •
                  tificat Deum & homines: whatsoeuer are the duties of ether table of the law, towards God in the former, in the later towards man the image of God, are the fruits of this vineyard that is the Church of Christ: and fruct us natiuitatis, the naturall and kindly fruits. For to what other end werewe made, redeemed, rege nerate, begotten a new by the immortal seed of Gods

word, sanctified and seasoned by his holy spirit, but that we should keepe his lawes, and walke before him in holynes, and righteousnes to our liues end?
            Lastly the rent that is giuen for the fruit of this vineyard. Luk. 16. is that redderationē
                at the cōming of Salomon: the issue wherof wil be on the one side, gaudium & corona, our ioy and our crowne; and Euge serue
               Phil. 4. Math. 25. Ezech. 3. & 33. 
               bone, well done good servant: on the other, sanguinem requiro, Irequire that bloud at thy handes, which hath beene spilt through thy negligence. Let Keepers vvell weigh with themselues the rent they must thē bring. 1. The reckoning riseth very high, as appeareth by the sūme in my text mille argētei, a thousand peeces of silver. 2. The singularity of accōptants aggravateth the danger, vir afferet, that is, quis
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                  , singuli afferent, every one shal accompt by the pole: and therfore folly for any one keeper to say nō agnoscar in populo magno, therEccle. 16. are so many keepers of vs, that what is my one soule amongst so many thousands? posuerunt me custodem in vineis (went before in the Canticle) vineam meam nō
               
               Cap. 1. 
               custodiui. They made me a keeper of the vineyards, and I haue not kept mine owne vineyard: wherevpō saith St Bernard, Ego huius loci occasione meipsum reprehendere soleo, quòd animarum curam suscep
                     •
                  rim: By occasion of this place I am wont to bee displeased vvith my selfe (sith the chardge of my private selfe was so difficulte) that ever I tooke vpon me the cure of soules. To recapirulate all that hath bin spoken, Salomon is Christ; the vineyard is his Church; Baal hamon the increase; the keepers are pastours; the fruit is the loue both of God & man; the rent, is the reckoning that must bee

yeelded vp at the comming of Salomon.
            What care the Lorde hath ever imbraced & tēdered his Church with (to omit his quid vltra? in the 5. of Esay, what should I more haue done? If we looke but in at the next dores to my text, wil presently appeare, vinea mea, quae m

                  hi, coram me: my vineyard, which is mine or belongeth tomee, is before me.

My vineyard, which is mine, is before me alwaies vnder the light of his countenance, vnder the eye of his prouidence, and the everlasting obiect both of his lookes, and of his loue also.
            A part of which his loue, and not the least is, as he delt with the wounded man in the Gospell, whom by reason of his many infirmities he commended to the goodman of the Inne, and deliuered him two pence

not out of want to himselfe, but for convenience to it, man vnto man beeing the meetest instrument to lead him to salvation, (speake thou vnto vs,
               20. Exod. 
               & we wil heare thee, but let not the Lord speak, least we die.) To these he hath perpetuated life & cōtinuance not in their singular persons, but in their line and succession, Ego vobiscum vs
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   ad finem saeculi, I am vvith you (ô ye keepers) to the worlds end. So the Apostle witnesseth, Eph. 4. 11. He hath giuen some to be Apostles, some prophets, some Evangelists, some pastours & teachers, for the gathering togither of his saints, for the worke of the ministerie, for the building of the bodie of Christ donec occurramus omnes, till we all meete, &c.
            
            Now what difference there is betweene keepers, & keepers themselues, I stand not to declare vnto you. Stabo super custodiam meam, but distributing the whole Church of Christ into two ranckes and companies, ordinem, & plebem as Tertullian sorteth thē,Exhort. ad cast. Desug. in. perseq.

They call for reformation, and reformation is granted them in doctrine and sacraments, to the vttermost.

ever this presbytery was instituted by Christ or his Apostles, and we are ready vpon the sight to ioine hands with them. But I verily assure my selfe, vnlesse they will wrest and pervert scripture, and in steed of the naturall milke it giueth, inforce out the bloud of violent interpretation, and cause it to walke a mile or two farther for their fancy, thē ever the holy Ghost meant it, there is not one word to be founde, that assertaineth this opinion.

From thence was he armed with letters and power to Damascus, to persecute the Saints: albeit the flower and strength of this presbytery was then cropt, what by the kingdome of Herod, & what by the Roman Lieutenantship: the other of the Christians, wherof we read 1.

            1. The persons (besides Priestes and Levites, which were ad subsidium (faith Iosephus) for assistance to the civil magistrate, for direction in doubts and difficulte cases of the law, for the Lord in things appertaining to God. 2.

                none vvere designed to these gouernements and iudgments but the chiefe of the families of Israell.
            
            2. The place for important businesses, that which the Lord him selfe should choose, 17. Deut. 8 (sometimes Shilo, sometimes Ierusalem) or for easier causes, the Cities: throughout all the tribes▪
                Deut. 16. 8. Or al the

Deut. 1. 16. betweene bloud and bloud, plea and plea, plague and plague, Deut. 17. 8. betweene law and precept, statute and iudgement, 2. Chron. 19. 10. Where Amariab the Priest was ordained chiefe in all matters of the Lord, and Zabadiah a ruler of the house of Iudah was for all the kings affaires.
            
            4 Lastly their power was: The people shall heare, and feare, & not doe presumptuously; and that man that shall doe presumptuously, that man shal die, Deut. 17. 12. The persons you see then, none but principal, the places cathedrall, the causes vniversall, the authoritie peremptorie and finall: Lastly (which may be ioined to the other) sith God and the King both haue their severall agents and advocates, the proceeding equall and vnpartiall: let them now frame their presbyterie out of either of these two. Vnlesse they will turne Cities into Parishes, and Villages, and Hamlets; Magistrates, Priests, & Levites into priests & people without magistrate; and regem himselfe sometimes into reum; and bring Moses to his owne barre; vnlesse Princes into mechanistes and artificers; heades into heeles for the most part, and perhaps into tailes, as the scripture speaketh; vnlesse sword into keies, death into Church-censures; Corporall into spirituall; Civill into sacred & Ecclesiastical, which were to turne

            Notwithstanding they haue brought thēselues in beleife, that our Saviour then transferred the Synedrion of the Iewes into the Christian Church, when hee gaue that direction, Mat. 18. 15. concerning offences Dic ecclesiae, tell the church. A place not easie to be vnderstood, because ecclesia is

            1 Certaine it is, that the offences there meant are priuate and personal, and such as lay in the power of the partie offended to burie in secret without farther discouerie,

            2 From the apparāt degrees of proceeding against such trespassers, as. 1.

you see the ende proposed in this course is not punishment, but amendment: therfore no need to bring the matter into open Court, there to receiue chastisement.
            3 It seemeth the Church is not oier and determiner in these complaints, because there is added in a fourth place, If he heare not the Church, let him bee vnto thee &c. but the presbyteries I hope will both heare and determine all that commeth before them.
            4 It is not said, if hee heare not the Church, let the Church excommunicate him (as the presbyteries do over-often) but

               , Let him be vnto thee, as an Ethnicke or Publican. So that he is sent backe againe to the plaintiffe, as it were to censure him. As much as to say, Immedi

How may that be? amputetur à familiari consortio (Erasm.) abstineas ab eo vt confundatur (Origen) Hold no famyliar acquaintance with him, that thou maist put him to shame.
            
            5 Finally there ought to bee no doubt, but this was spoken to the Iewes, because the reproach is, sit tibi tanquam Ethnicus, let him be vnto thee, as an heathen: there being no nation vnder heauen, that disdeigned and detested Gentiles saue the Iewes alone. Ethnicis, exquibus deindè composita erat ecclesia, praeceptum dare noluit, vt seipsos fugerēt. He gaue no precept to the Gē
                  tiles,
               
               of whom the Church was afterwards composed, to shunt themselues. He would rather haue said, if hee had spoken to the Gentiles, sit tibi tanquam Iudaus, let him be as a Iew vnto thee. What is all this then to vs Christians?
            6 Shall wee further aske the mindes of the learned for the clearer explanation of these words? One telleth vs, Non ad synagogam ablegat suos, hee remitteth
               Gloss. no

               not his disciples to the synagogue, for redresse of their wrongs. There was little helpe to be hoped for, where they presentlie excommunicated all that but profestCaluin. Christ. An other helpeth out the reason, Erat tū ecclesia adulterata, the Church that them was, was adulterated, and therefore vnmeete to bee iudge over Christians. Was there no church of Christ which they mightBrent. repaire vnto? Yes, fuit illorum temporum Ecclesiola, inBucer. deed, there was a little church at that time; but ecclesiae facies nulla, that Church had no apparance vvithout.
               Caluin. Nay, nulla adbue ecclesia, will a third say▪ 
               ther was not any Church at all. And yet we are willed, you heare, to tell the Church. Which some say was an order

               appointed by CHRIST to last to the vvorldes ende▪
                others, no generall rule prescribed to the ChurchBrent. for all ages, but a temporatie precept like those other in the Gospell, Go not into the vvaie of the Gentiles; and possesse not siluer nor gold in your purses. St. Ierome saith, Die Ecclesiae, is as much to say, as multis dicendum est, vt detestationieum habeant, tell many to make him hateful vnto them: vt qui pudore non potuit, sa
                     •
                  uetur opprobrijs, that whom honestie and ingenuity could not, disgrace may reclaime. St. Chrysostome

saith, ecclesiae, that is, his qui praesidēt ecclesiae, the rulers of the Church. Carth. ioineth thē both in one, vel congregationi communitèr, vel praelato, id est, iudici, either the cōgregatiō at large, or the praelate, that is, the iudge: nō quod ipse sit multitudo, sed praeest multitudini, Abulens. not that the prelate is the whole multitude, but because he is chiefe ouer it. Aquinas likwise both. Ecclesiae, that is, vel toti multitudini, vt cōfūdatur, vel iudicibus ut corrigatur; either the whole multitude for his cōfusiō, or the iudges for his correctiō. Lastly Erasmus both: vt vel multitudinis cōsensu, vel 
                     •
                  orū authoritate qui multitudini praesunt, emendetur; that either by consent of the multitude, or authority of those that are ouer the

                  . 
               multitude, he may be amended. Some say, Dic ecclesiae that is, in caetu fidelium, in quo verbum & sacramenta rectè administrantur; in the assembly of the faithfull wherin the word and sacraments are rightly administred. Others to the cōtrary: Nemo it a accipiat quasi in
               Bucer. 
               publica concione, let no man vnderstand it so as if in a publique auditory: for nec ratio, nec vsus suadet congregandā
                  
                     •
                  sse ecclesiā
                (saith Caietan) it stādeth not either with reason or custome; that the whole Church should be troubled about a priuate fault. Lastly they are but of yesterday, that tel you Dic ecclesiae is no more to say,
                  
                     •
                  llyr. &c. then Dic sentoribus et Doctoribus personam ecclesiae representātibus tell the elders & Doctors that repraesent

Now summe vp al into one. 1. Not to the Synagogue, why? 2. that Church was adulterated. 3. the other was but a little Church. 4. had no face of a Church. 5. no essence. 6. an order to the worlds end. 7. a temporary praecept. 8. elders and doctours, 9. Certaine and lawfull magistrates. 10. in the assembly of the faithful. 11. not in an open auditory. 12. multitude in common. 13. presidents over the multitude. How is it possible out of a place of scripture, so variously interpreted by ancient and moderne writers to make faith and perswasion to the world, that the Church intended by our Sauiour is that Church, which they labour for?
            But they haue other subsidiary scriptures, especially where the Christian presbytery is more expresly named, that make without controuersy for their purpose. By name, that to Timothy 1. and 4. per impositionem manuum presbyterii: which though some haue expounded the office and ministration it selfe, which Timothy then receiued, yet grant it importeth an order and company of men from whom he receiued it, the very imposition of hands there named doth sufficiently discharge them from being lay-elders. There was a presbytery, we deny not, in the primitiue Church, that is to say a colledge or conuent of presbyters, assistants to the Bishop: which Ignatius in an epistle to the Trallians calleth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a knot of Apostles: and afterwards asking what that presbytery was, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; answereth himselfe, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , an holy congregation, counsailours and coassessours to the Bishop. And for these at the time of ordination to hold their hands

vpon the heades of presbyters and deacons iuxta manum episcopi (as you haue heard before) neare the hand of the Bishop was agreable to a Canon of the fourth coūcel of Carthage.
            There remaineth one place more 1. Tim. 5. 17. which they hold as a Delphian oracle, their Deus Terminus, that yeeldeth to none, an vnremoueable argument never to be answered.
            
               The elders that rule wel, let them be accompted worthy of double honor; especially those that labour in the word & doctrine. This is the mine wherout the whole body and frame of their consistory is digged, pastours, where it is said 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , in the word; Doctours, out of the next, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               and doctrine. Their lay elders out of the former, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the elders that rule well▪
                where 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                is the genus common to both kindes; but the essential difference that giueth name & being, is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; and not 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               labouring and not labouring in word and doctrine.
            
            
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , especially is their Mercury to interpret all; a signe of discretion and distinctiō to passe betwixt the gouernours of both these sorts. Their illation is, there were elders that ruled well, and laboured besides in the word and doctrine; therfore there were other elders that ruled and laboured not &c. This is the Gorgons head that amazeth and amateth al that looke vpon it. It were quickly answered, by the iudgment of a learned diuine vpon this place, Calvinus primus est qui locum hunc de senioribus exponit, that exposition thenAdr. S

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , dispensatores verbi, pastours, Doctours, dispensers of the word, &c. Iudicant, praedicant, so they thought, & so they wrote and published. We may deliver their opinion summarily in one word of Caietā, Nomen presbyteri hoc in loco ordinis est; The name of elder in this place is a name of order. Then where are their lay elders?
            2 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , which signifieth both honour, and allowance, from the iust correspondences and circumstances of the place, is rather to be rendred in the later sense. So Chrysostome vnderstandeth it, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , nourishment and raiment, and the subministration of necessary things, whereof he giveth the reason, which never any law of God, nor any rule or example of the Church of Christ awarded to these lay rulers.
            3 The double that is here spoken of, (not the compensation of those that rule ill, for they are quite excluded, and deserue nothing; but of such as rule wel) is not in comparison with any Lay gouernours, but double (saith Chrysostome) 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , in regard of widdowes 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               double, & reverentie, & subsidij (Aquinas) both of reverence and maintenance; or double sibi. & suis (Winton) both for themselues, and those of their chardge.

                preaching elders. First, Non dicit qui praesunt, sed qui benè praesunt, saith Caietan, as Oecumenius before him. But who are those? Qui super officium superintē
                  dendi adiungunt & laborem, who to their office of superintendencie and oversight put also their industry. So as, nihilest hoc verbum Maximè (with some) sed explicatio benè: Especially in the later member doth but explicate well in the former: (Carthus.) Qui verè presbyteros agunt, qui non solum integritate vitae praelucent populo, verum etiam laborant in dispensatione sermonis evangelici (Erasmus) goodlivers, & paineful preachers. How many interpretations might bee brought to divert and disapoint their lay governors? Jf either there were such as but red and administred▪ Sacraments in the Church, and preached not (as the most reverend Archb. of Canterb. last deceased proveth at large) these may 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               1. Tim. 3. the Apostle numbreth aptnes & ability to teach. So then the genuine and true sense of the words by analogie of this whole scripture, and iudgement of the learned is: The elders not Lay, but Cleargy, which governe well sibi, familijs, gregibus, themselues, their families, their flockes, are worthy, whither of high regard, or abundant supply, or both, it skilleth not: especiallie those that labour in word and doctrine, not Pastours & Doctours distinct; but in verbo scientibus, in doctrina ignorantibus (Anselm.) in the word to those that know
               
already, in doctrine to those that are yet to learne; in verbo exhortationis, in doctrina instructionis (Carth.) in word of exhortation in doctrine of instruction: in verbo exhortatorio affectus, doctrinâ instruente intellectum (Caiet) exhortation for the affectiōs, instructiō for the vnderstanding. VVhere

                   especially, needeth not be aduersatiue, or a particle of discretion, but may be put 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                to serue for interpretation, they that rule well, that is to say, they that labour &c. nor doth it signify praesertìm especially, for thē they thinke it should haue bene 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , with some other helpe put to it; but plurimùm earnestly: nor is it praepositum, a particle of praeposition set before the verbe, but appositum of appositiō, to be construed after it in this sense, maximè laborantes, that is, laborantes maximè. Or if they will needs haue it distinctiue & to make a difference betweene two sorts, yet doth it not followe of diuerse persōs, but parts of their calling; not subiects, but respects; not generum, but munerum, kindes and professions of men, but branches of their function. As if you should say for example sake, the Ministers that rule well in attendance and care of their flocks, and that labour in word and doctrine, are worthy of double honour; especially those that seeke and maintaine the peace of the Church: In which speech the persōs are still the same that were, but their qualities & dueties diuersified. Or thus: the King that ruleth his people wel, and laboureth the good both of Church, and commonwealth, is worthy of double honour, both of allegiance, and alowance from his subiects; especially he that taketh vp the crosse of Christ, and beareth his

soule in his hands, as ready and as likely to lay downe his life for defence of the truth, as any of his subiects. Lastly, what mine opinion of this sentence in hand is, can no way better appeare, then by a parallel peece of scripture 1. Thes. 5. at the 12. vers. Compare it with this to Timothy, and you shall find not the morning and evening suns more like. Now we be seech you brethren that you knowe them, which labour amongst you, and are ouer you in the Lord, and admonish you; that you haue them in singular loue for their worke sake. For 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                to Timothy, you haue 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                here, from the same theame, superiors in both; there 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and here 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , in both labouring; for worde and doctrine in the one, in the other, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , admonition▪
                there 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , singular loue; Lastly the reason is here giuen of this superabundant affection towards thē, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               for their worke sake, which is the truest implyed cause of honour in that other place, sith 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                is no more to say, then especially for that they labour amongst you.
            But it hath fared with our brethren in this case, as with him that stood on the Key at Athens, and euery ship that was arriuing towards the hauē he cried was his: so they wheresoeuer they haue met with any word though but common and generall, and diuersly expounded, yet that beareth any the least propension and fauour towards the vpholding of the eldership, presently they conclude that very species and sort of all others, which they most fansy: as if all windes blew for their gouernment, and none else.
            Thence they inferred from the 18. of Math. Tell the
               
               Church, Ergo no Church there but this presbytery. Thēce from the rule to Timothy, The elders that rule wel &c. therfore these lay elders. Thence, from the 12. to the Rom. he that ruleth with diligence, thefore these rulers. And 1. Cor. 12. bycause 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , gouermentes, is one of the giftes of the holy Ghost there named, therfore this gouerment. Bycause Tertullian hath,In Apol. 
               Praesident apud nos probati qui

                   seniores, theer gouerne with vs none but approued seniours: And Ierome vpō Esay 3. Nos habemus in ecclesia senatum nostrum, caetū presbyterorum, we haue in the Church our senate, a cō
                  pany of presbyters; & vpon. Tit. 1. Communi presbyterorum consilio regebātur ecclesiae, Churches were gouerned by a common counsaile of presbyters; quorum sine consilio nihil agebatur in ecclesia, Ambr. vpon 1. Tim. 5. without whose counsaile nothinge was done in the Church: (which may be well vnderstood of elders in yeares & experience & grauity, hauing some tē
               porary commission to assist in ordering the Church, but no ordination perpetuall & diuine, as is now vrged;) therfore these & none others are those presidēts, and senators, and advisers intended by the fathers.
            I am now at an end: And I heartily wish in the bowells of our Sauiour there might at last be an end of all these controuersies▪ that in variety of opinions our brethren would propose to themselues the example of the ancient fathers, of whom it is saide, sanctorum patrum disputationes non contentiones, sed collationes erant; the fathers conferred and reasoned about matters in question, contended not. It is agreed betwixt St Ierome and St Austin before they dispute

               vt veritas superet, that truth may bee the conquerour: Cum

Cont. Donat 18. learned of the Church, yet never severed himselfe, & perswaded others likewise not to doe it: Et si se ille se parasse

                  , quàm multi sequerentur, quantum sibi nomen inter homines faceret quanto lōgiùs Cyprianistae, quàm Donatistae vocarētur? Cyprians breach with the church would haue drawne many followers after him, and haue spred the name of Cyprianists, farther then Donatistes. But in whom there is more then this, a willing & wilfull disturbance of the churches peace, I would in the name of God they were throughly perswaded, that they are as strictly bound to preserue vnum, as verum, vnity, as verity, pacem, as fidem, the quiet as the faith of the Church: and that there will bee little difference held at Salomons rent-day, whither they haue wounded the head, which is Salomon himselfe with haeretical opinion, or whither lacerated and rent in peeces his body with schismaticall distraction.

               Cyp. 
               sanguine eluitur macula ista: the fault is vnexpiable; the blood of martyrdome cannot wash out this spot. I now call to minde a dialogue that Tully hath in his bookes de legibus; where interloquution passeth betweene 3. Philosophers, Quintus, Marcus, and Atticus. The argument was definibus bonorum & malorum. The first beginneth, Controversam rem & plenam dissensionis inter doctissimos: a matter of great controversie and debate amōgst the most learned: the secōd, sed aliquādò tamen iudicandam, yet it must be determined: the thirde, quî istuc fieri potest A. Gellio mortuo? how can it ever be since A. Gellius is dead? Quintus replieth, quid tandem id adrē? what is that to the matter? Atticus answereth him, J haue heard that he called all the Philosophers at Athens into one place, and earnestly laboured them to set some end to their controversies; quòd si essent eo animo vt nollent at atem in litibus conterere, posse rem convenire: if they were of that minde that they woulde not spend their daies in strife, they might come to agreement. Blessed be the name of God, we haue no such impediment to the composing of our controversies. Our A. Gellius liueth (and long may he liue, even for ever and ever.) But why doe I borrow a prophane name? Rather out of my text, our Salomon, our Pacificus liveth, who after the Prince of our peace, hath best interpreted this name amongst vs; who hath turned swords into sithes, and speares into matt

                that hee gaue to the king and as a king; both his threshing store for an altar, and his oxen for sacrifice, & his chariots and plough-harnesse for fire. Our King & as a King, hath taken no lesse care out of his royal & religious heart, both for altar, sacrifice, & fire, for church, and maintenance to it. And finding by experience the miserable policie of that discipline, which hath brought vpon the ministers of the gospell verissimos labores & certissimam egestatem, vnstinted paines, and vndoubted penurie, having turned the livings of the Church into Nunries (one saith) I know not his meaning, vnlesse he vnderstand Nonres, or non entia, (as you heard the last day) seeketh by all princely meanes to put bloud into the veines of the Church againe, which many daughters of the horsleach haue suckt out, & to bring backe to life that presbyterium, liuelyhoode of the Church, which many a Iulian hath done away, and to the profligation whereof, even that presbytery, whereof we speake, hath beene accessary. There wanteth nothing, for ought I see, but so much wisedome and grace and thankfulnes in vs that are the keepers of the vineyard, as to embrace the opportunity of time now offered vs, which our fathers before vs would haue beene glad of, & posterity after vs heartily

wish for: and all contentions laide aside, ioine hande and heart with his religious Maiesty in propagation of this vineyard, and propugnation of the gospell and faith of Christ; whose life more precious then thousāds of ours (as the people spake of Dauids) is a thousād times more sought after, thē any of ours; as if the enemies of God and his maiesty had decreed amongst themselues, as the Aramites against the King of Israel 1. reg. 22. fight neither against great nor small, saue only against the King of GREAT BRITAINE and his OF-SPRING.

O Lord giue thy iudgments to the King & thy righteousnes to the Kings sonne. And asGen. 49. Iacob prophecied of that sceptre, that it should not depart from Judah til Shiloh came, so if thy holy will be, let not the sceptre of these Kingdomes depart frō our Iacob, our Salomon, our pacificus and his Line, till that Shiloh come againe. To whom with the father & the holy ghost, al might and mercy be ascribed in his Church for euer.
