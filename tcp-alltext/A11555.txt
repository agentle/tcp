               I Neither haue, or can
forget (VVorſhipful
& my very good
Friend) the courteous
entertainement
you gaue to my Booke, entituled
A Godly exerciſe for Christian Families,
neyther may I (without
iniurie to your good nature, and
impeach to my poore credite) let
ſlip opportunitie, wherein I may
ſhew my ſelfe thankefull for ſo

great and vndeſerued fauour. But
wading into the very bottome of
all my habilitie, and finding nothing
ſufficient to counteruaile
ſuch kindnes: I am like the poore
Perſian, who deſirous to ſhew him
ſelfe thankefull to Alexander for
ſparing his life, & finding nothing
worthy to be giuen to ſo great
a Monarch, died with very conceit
of ſorow. Euen ſo worſhipfull
Sir, the very conceit of my
want, though not able to ſtay me
as it did this Perſian, yet ſtriketh
me with ſuch a confounded impreſſion,
as cloſeth vp the 
                  •••
               wes
and arteries of my preſent iudgement,
did not hope encourage me
with ſome better hap to come.
            Vntill which time my VVorſhipfull
good friend, let this ſmall
argument of a farre greater good
will, excuſe my inſufficiencie, and
win acceptance in your woonted

affable nature: perſwading your
ſelfe, that I liue, in hart and vnfained
affection, next vnder God and
the Queene my gracious Miſtres,
to do you the vtmoſt deuoire and
ſeruice I can.
            Now a little to informe you as
concerning this ſmall Treatiſe, in
the iudgement of the learned, it
hath been commended for a very
godly and comfortable labour: in
that it diſcourſeth of the moſt
high argument that may be handled
in writing, euen Loue, the beginning
and ende wherof, no humane
wit can comprehend. And
one thing ſhall not bee amiſſe for
your worſhip to marke, that this
Booke being written by Friers,
men of no ſmal reckoning among
the Papiſts: yet how they write
againſt their own idolatry, ſuperſtition
and trumperie, & inueigh
at the great follies and diſorders

among themſelues, is to be noted,
which was ſome cauſe why I publiſhed
it at this inſtant, when men
of that coat and cogniſance, grow
to ſo many wicked and rebellious
attempts. If they will read this
Booke, I thinke they may finde
matter enough to fal out of Loue
with their blind ignorance, and vnite
themſelues to the true & liuely
image of Loue, euer God and
his Church, which I deſire they
may, if God haue not altogether
giuen thē ouer: or els to confound
them & what they intend, to the
hurt of his trueth, and our moſt
gracious Queene. Thus leauyng
further to trouble your VVorſhip,
I remain deuoted to you and
yours in all hartie and humble affection.

is Loue, not that fonde and laſciuious
Loue, whereof the Poets are inuenters:
but of that holie & diuine Loue,

whereof God himſelfe is the onelye
foundation, according as it is written,
Deus est charitas: And in this
occaſion of ſo high and excellent conſequence,
albeit no tongue can ſufficientlie
ſpeake of it, nor wit or iudgment
of man ſound the depth alſo ſacred

poore Talent which God hath giuen
mée, I will labour to finde out that
true and perfecte Image of Chriſtian
Loue, which is the beautie and glory
of Heauen, and maketh wretched ſinners
like Gods on the earth. And to
this onelie end is all the matter following
intended,The purpoſe of the diſcourſe. to diſtinguiſh all

               Of naturall Loue.
Chapter. 2.
               WHen I entred into conſideration
of the verye worde it ſelfe,

Loue,Loue is firſt ſought for by Nature and that I would gladlie finde
the true forme or portrait thereof, yet
ignoraunt howe or where to come by
it: I went firſt vnto Nature, as one
deſirous to ſée how I could be furthered
by her in ſo ſerious a ſerche. Shee
ſhewed me manie goodlie platformes
and figures, which ſhee receiued (as
ſhe ſaid) from her Predeceſſors, and
for that cauſe ſhe was the more charie
and choiſe of them. Yet notwithſtanding,
I had no great liking to thē,
becauſe not onelie their colours decayed,
but their vertues were growne
of no account or reputation: yet were
they eſtéemed among wiſe men, fooles
and Heathen men, yea amongſt beaſtes
and vnreaſonable, but for ſo little
profit was to be looked for by them
in my preſent intent, I could not entertaine
anie opinion of them, and yet
it ſhall not bee greatlie out of ſquare,
for me to tell you what thinges they
were which Nature ſhewed me.
               The firſt figure which ſhe brought
me,The firſt Image of Naturall Loue. terming it by the name of the Image
of Loue, was the Loue among
Kindred and Parents, which I did

verie well remember could bee of no
value, except the holy Ghoſt ſet helping
hand too: by reaſon it is ſometime
verie hurtfull, it maketh men
blinde, peruerteth the true order of
Iuſtice, and fooles▪ (verie
often) before wiſe men▪ It taketh awaie
right iudgment, contrary vnto
S. Paules doctrine and example, for
he ſaith,2, Cor, 5, 16, 
                  Neminem nouimus ſecundum
carnem. We know no man after kindred
or carnall affection.
                   It cauſed
Hely to be reprooued of God, when as
he himſelfe rebuked him thus.1, Reg, 2, 11 
                  Why
haſt thou made more of thy children
then of me? Wherefore, as it foloweth
in the Bible, he died an euil death
and his children likewiſe. It hindereth
vs alſo from finding our Lorde
and Sauiour Chriſt Jeſus, as wee
haue an example or figure left in the
holie Goſpell after Saint Luke,Lu
                        ••
                     44. 45 that
when Chriſte was ſought among hys
kinſefolke and acquaintance, he could
not be founde: which made S. Barnard
to ſay: Lord I can not find thee,
but in thy Croſſe.
               
               The ſecond Image of Loue, which

Nature ſhewed me,The ſecond Image of naturall Loue. was betwéen the
bodie and the ſoule. The ſoule loueth
the bodie ſo déerelie, that it ſuffereth
great paine and ſorrowe to be parted
from it, but when it is ordered by the
holie Ghoſt:Rom, 8, ſo that the ſoule vſe the
bodie vnder the Law of God, to be repentant
to giue thankes, to profitte other,
and to chuſe rather the want of
all earthlie pleaſure, yea, to die, rather
than to commit ſuch ſinne as ſhal
offend her maker. If theſe coloures
had 
                     〈◊〉
                   laid on this Image, then
would I haue ſaid Nature had doone
like a perfect worke woman. But her
loue béeing tied to this life, deſiring
to ioy and delight héere in this world,
to hide long in luſtes and wanton
pleaſures, and for the maintaining of
them▪ not to care for the diſpleaſure of
God: I muſt néedes ſay the deuill
was too néere when this counterfeit
was drawne, and hath infected it ſo
much with his miſcheuous preſence,
as he draweth all (that ſo leade theyr
liues) to hell headlong after him, iuſtlie
agréeing with the ſaying of Saint
Auguſtine. By ſuch as theſe are, the

Cittie of the deuill is builded.
               
               The third Image of Loue ſhown
by Nature,The thyrd Image of Naturall Loue. was betwéene the fiue
wittes and theyr obiects. As when the
ſight is preſented with beautifull
thinges, or deuiſes of variable and arteficiall
colours. Or when the hearing
is delighted with the ſounde of
ſwéete voices, or daintie muſical harmonie.

betwéene fréendes, and ſuch as are
mutuallie brought vp together in cō
                  panie
from their youth. And al theſe
being not gouerned by the diuine ſpirite
of direction, it is eaſy to knowe
what harme commeth by them, therfore
I hadde good reaſon to perſwade
my ſelfe, that none of theſe was the

ſpeciall Image of Loue I looked for,
neyther that Nature could bring mee
to the ſight thereof indéede, and therefore.
I thought it beſt for me to diſpoſe
my thoughtes to a further ſearch:
               But then on a ſoddaine came to my
remembraunce,The deſcription of an Image in olde time had in great account among the Romaines▪
                   howe the Romaines
in olde time hadde an Image among
them, which they greatlie prayſed,
and made no ſmall eſtimation thereof.
This Image (as I haue read) was
portrayed like a young man, ſtanding
dare headed, hauing written on hys
fore-head, Estas et Hie
                        •
                     s, Summer
and Winter, and he was clothed in
a ſhort thin coate, on the hem whereof
they had written, Mors et Vita.
Death and Life. His fide was open,
that his hart might be ſéene, and hys
army was bowed, poynting wyth hys
finger to his hart, where might bee
ſeene written Longe et prope, far and
néere. When I had well viewed thys
counterfeite, and perſwading my ſelf
there was ſome ſecrete meaning ſhadowed
in this deuiſe: I was immediatly
made acquainted with y• whole
conceit thereof, and euery circūſtance

declared vnto mee as followeth.
               The ca

                  e why he was paynted
like a young Men,The meaning of this Romaine Image. ſignified, that true
Loue and loyall fréendſhip is alwaies
freſh, chéerefull and amiable, neuer
fading or fayling for any extremitye
whatſoeuer. Hee was bare headed,
not aſhamed to ſhewe himſelfe vnto
all men, and likewiſe that he was not
afrayd to ſhewe himſelfe a friende at
all occaſions. His rude and thinne
veſture, declared, that a very fréende
indéede, wyll not refuſe to ſuffer hard
exigents, and extreame neceſſity, for
the loue of his fréend. The cauſe why
Mors et Vita was written on the
hemme of his garment, was, that h

                  e
which loueth truelie his fréend, continueth
ſo all hys life vnto death, and
after death likewiſe, ſo farre as the
bonds of fréendſhip may ſtretch Ectas
et. Hiems on his forehead, ſignified, that
vnfayned fréendſhip endureth as wel
in aduerſity as in proſperitie. Hys
hart was open to be ſéene, meaning
he woulde not hide or conceale anye
thing from his freende and Louer.
               And poynting his finger towardes

his hart, be declared that his deedes

                     〈◊〉

looke much vppon it, it ſhal bewitch
you and make you blinde. And if you
ſet you loue vpon the world (ſayth

who is the verye Image of loue indeede,
can not be in you. The Prophet
Dauid ſhewed me likewiſe, that
theſe reuenous foules, beaſte and ſerpents,
were lyuing men, bewitched
and tranſformed by reaſon of this

falſe Image, and ſhewed the cauſe
why, ſaying Hom
                        •
                      cum in honore eſset.
&c. Man Lord of all creatures, hauing
in himſelfe the liuelie Image of
God
                   (from whence he ought to draw
forth ſhe very Image of Loue) to hys
high honour: knewe not his degree
and hie eſtate that God had made
him for, but ſette his minde more on
theſe vaine and outward tranſitorye
thinges, where through he is tranſformed
and compared to beaſts moſt
vnreaſonable, and ſo is made like vnto
them.
               
               O falſe Image, I am right ſure
thy colours be full of miſchiefe, and
repleat with all the deceyts that may
bee deuiſed. Thus Saint Iohn had
me loke circumſpectlie vpon it, for the
matter that it was made of was very
brittle, venemous and nought: therefore
I tooke it vp in my hand, & loked
the more warily vpon it, when I perceiued
that Saint Iohn ſayde trueth,
where he ſayth:2, Ioh, 2, 16 
                  Quoniam omne quod
est in Mundo, concupiſcentia carnis est,
et concupiſcentia oculorum, et ſuperbia
vitae, quae none eſt ex patrè▪ ſed ex mundo

est. For all that is in the world, as the
luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes,
and the pride of life: is not of the father,
but of the world. I remembred
alſo, that the fruit which ſéemeth
to the eye moſt beautifull and fayre,
is ſooneſt rotten, and of leaſt continuaunce.
1, Cor, 7, 31 And Saint Paule ſayth, Praeterit
enim figura huius mundi. The faſhion
of the worlde paſſeth ſoone away.
In time of tribulation it melteth
away as ſnow before the ſunne.
Est enim amicus ſecundum tempùs ſuum,
                  Eccl, 6, 8 
                  et non permanebit in die tribulatioins.
Therefore it is a freende for hys
owne turne, and will not abide in the
time of trouble. Such fréendſhip is
hollow and empty, as though it were
blowne full of wind, and ſo light that
it wyll be moued with euery blaſt, ſo
brittle that it wyll break with the very

very ill, it hath ſome time ſo mad
a countenaunce, that it wyll make
fooles to ioye and laugh ſo excéedinglie,

Therefore the Wiſeman ſayth. Riſum

A foole doth wickedly, and maketh

               Thys Image of the World taketh
away the memory of man, making
him cleane to forget God, and all that

And ſo at the length, for the great pleaſure

               Thus perceiuing theſe and manye
more euill properties in this worldly
Loue.Nahum. 3, 7 I ſayd wyth the Prophet Nahum,
Omnis qui viderit te, reſiliet, ate.
Euery wiſe man that looketh vppon

Of Arteficiall Images of loue, if the true Image be amongſt them. the worlde nor the fleſhe

I went to the Shoppes of the Artezans,
ſuch as make goodly Images of
diuers matters, as in mettall, ſtone,

conceit on the ſuddaine did perſwade

there were manie ſpeciall figures
of daintie workmanſhipp, as of
God the Father, Chriſt Crucified on

poore and needy Chriſtian brother
in great want and pennury, ſpareſt
the treaſure of mercye and pittie in
thine hart, which might greatly releeue
him, and manifeſt thy godlie
loue: howe may it be ſaid, that godlie
charity is in thee? Why Syrre,
ſaid I, may not I ſpende myne owne
goods as I will, ſo as I doo not careleſlie
waſte them away in ſinne?▪ If

the maintayning & defending of the

Thus almoſt confounded, I
ſaide to him, beware Sir what yee
ſay, your opinion condemneth the dooinges
of manie good menne in elder
time, who honoured the Temples of
God with manie goodlie Images of
great coſt, of ſiluer and golde, ſet with
pearles and ſtones, great plenty of
Copes and Veſtiments of Tiſſue and
cloth of Golde, and meruailous riches
in plate, as Croſſes, Candleſtickes,
Cenſours, Chalices, with many other
thinges, which haue béen thought
greatlie to the honour of God. Alas,
ſayd he, I ſée it is but vaine to preach
and teach men, to learne and take example
of Saint Ambroſe,
                  Let the Papiſts marke thys place well. 
                  Auguſtine,
Gregory, Exuperii, Nicholas, Martin,
with diuers other holie Biſhops and
ſuch like, in whoſe time were little or
none at all vſed of theſe thinges, for
they would haue all thinges that belonged
to the church, (and ſpecially to
the Sacraments) honeſt, decent, pure
and cleane, but not coſtlie or curious.
Then were tréene Chalices, and golden
Prieſtes, but nowe are golden

Chalices and tréene Prieſtes, or rather
earthen Prieſtes. Then were
holie and religious men, clad in haire

Paule ſayth. Templum Dei ſanctum eſt
quod estis vos. The Temple of God is
holie, which Temple ye are. The
Temple of ſtone is not holye, but by
reaſon of the liuing Temple, therefore
that is farre more holie, and needeth
much more to be reléeued, maintayned
and adorned. Should we then
goe lay vp, or ſpend our ritches on the
ſtonie Temple, and ſuffer the lyuing
Temple, the members of Chriſtes
precious body and blood, to periſh eyther

                  
                     〈◊〉
                   or ghoſtlie? Wee finde
not that Chriſt commaunded to haue
ſuch coſtly ornaments in his Church,
but very manie times commaunded
to nouriſh his poore members: and
nowe men leaue the commandements
of God, for their owne traditions
and ceremonies, as the Scribes
and Phariſies did, and fall ſo farre into
theyr owne Idolatrous inuentions
as they altogether forget theyr
chriſtian

                  .
               But ſome ſay againſt mee, howe
Moyſes made the Tabernacle of God
with great ſumptuouſnes of Syluer,
Gold, and precious Stones, and likewiſe
howe Salomon built the Temple:
but this maketh not with them,
but rather againſt them.1, Cor, 10, 11 
                  For all ſuch
thinges were but ſignes and ſhaddowes,
as Saint Paule ſayth, vnto
vs vnder Chriſtes Law. which is the
ſpirituall and perfect lawe: therfore
we ſhould leaue the ſhaddowe and folowe
the trueth, auoyding that which
is imperfect, and cleaue to that which
is perfect. Alſo in the time of Moyſes,
there was no néede to giue almes to

the poore people: for they were fedde
with 
                     〈◊〉
                   in deſert, and theyr clothings
decayed not of all the time that
they were there, as it is read in Deutronomy.

                  He that hath called
you from darknes into ſo great
light of grace, and hath nowe taken
you vnto his ſpouſes: hath nowe ſhowen
you this glorious Image, and

hath giuen it to you much more goodly
then I can diſcribe it as it is, for it
is infinite and incomprehenſible: yet
it pleaſeth him to ſhewe it vnto all
meeke ſoules after theyr capacitie,
calling them his daughters, ſaying:
Audi filia, Heere my daughter in
true ſayth and obedience, Et vide, and
ſee what I haue doone, and dayly do

or haue doone for me, ſee alſo what I
doo prepare for you. The beholding
of theſe three thinges, I think ſhoulde
leaue ſome print of this heauenly Image
in our ſoules: but much more
in you who are his ſpeciall and choſen

               And of this worthie and diuine
Image of Loue, I would gladly ſhew
you ſome what, in part to performe
mine intent, and yet I feare mee of
preſumption, in enterpryſing to
ſhewe that I neuer knewe, or that
you knowe much better then I: yet
a blinde man may ſhewe that he cannot
ſee, eſpeciallie when it is put into
his handes.
               Saint Paule put a Glaſſe into my

hand, I meane pure, reuerend and holy
Scripture, and had me come foorth
of darknes into the light, for if thou
deſireſt to ſée this perfect Image,
thou muſt looke deuoutly and earneſt
he in this glaſſe, for it can be ſhewed
no other wiſe héere in this life, but
by a glaſſe, or in a darke ſimilitude,
which dooth not ſhewe the thing expreſſlie
as it is: but the time ſhal come
I hope, that we ſhall ſée the very ſelfe
ſame thing indeede, to our great comfort
and euerlaſting ſaluation. I looked
in this glaſſe, and I could ſee nothing,
but mine owne face fowlye deformed
with many filthye ſpottes. I
was bidden to goe waſhe me & make
me cleane, and gette me to the light,
and ſo I did: yet mine eyes were ſo
dymme with duſt and humour, of vanitie
and carnalitie, that I could not
perceiue this glorious Image.See heere how frailtie maketh him fall againe, after the maner and cuſtome of the papiſtes I wēt

all their gay ſinging and playing on
Organs, or multiplying of prayers

can they be euident ſignes and

times ſome of them greatly hinder
deuotion and contemplation, ſtirring

is to edify our neighbour,
                  1, Cor, 12, 25 
                  to thinke

conſidering our ſelues are as one
body in Chriſt. We ſhould be as glad
of our neighbours profitt, as of our
owne, and to helpe them in theyr diſtreſſe,
as we would be holpen in our
owne néede: louingly to reforme and
correct them that doo amiſſe, to helpe
and reléeue them that bee fallen in decay
eyther bodily or ghoſtly, to cheriſh

and in ſewe wordes to knit vppe the

                  To referre all our riches, labour,

may profit and doo good to many in

not borne for his owne profit, nor lyued
heere for his owne pleaſure, nor
dyed to doo himſelfe good, or to come

wholly and euerie way to our vſe

of the religious perſonnes ſhould bee
much more ioyfull, pleaſant and eaſye
then they are: where nowe wee ſee
them verie contrarie, heauie, painful,
laborious,A very neceſſary note for the time preſent. full of ſuperſtitious obſeruaunces
and vaine cuſtomes, leauing
aſide the true way of life, the following
of Chriſt, the olde manner of lyuing,
that was taught, vſed, & ſhowne
by our holy forefathers S. Auguſtine
S. Ierome, S. Benet, with manie other,
ſo that nowe there is little difference
betwéene laye people, & prieſts,
and religious perſons, both in worldlie
liuing and criminall offences. Yet
is it ſaid vnto them by S. Paul. Nolite
cōformari huic ſeculo.
                  Rom. 12, 
                  Be not ye faſhioned
like vnto this world. And though
their outwarde habit differ in colour,
yet is it like ye world for exceſſe price
and value. So if S. Auguſtine or S.
Ierome were aliue again (whom they

orders of liuing) I thinke they ſhould
not knewe them, but woulde rather
ſay, there was neuer any thing that
they more reprooued, then ſuch liuing
as is nowe a daies in manie places of
the world.I would this might bee conſidered according as it ought to bee. They would ſay, that they
ordeyned the manner of lyuing after
the rule of Chriſt and his bleſſed Apoſtles,
and not after the ſuperſtitious
manners of the Iewes: who made
gay and fayre all thinges outwardlie,
and were inwardly full of rauine,
venome, ſinne and mallice.
               The Image of Loue that Saint
Paule drewe, and which theſe holie
Fathers had ſet forth openly in theyr
houſes of Religion, warning theyr
diſciples and ſucceſſours before all other
thinges, to looke dilligently theron,
vnder great excommunications
and payne of puniſhment: is nowe
portrayed with diſpenſations, deceiues
with vayne cuſtomes and ceremonies,
The Church of Rome abuſing the true & auncient Image of Loue. with falſe, forged and deceiuable
collours, ſo that it is cleane altered
and chaunged from the true olde
forme and ſimilitude, and béeing nothing
els but a méere fraudulent and

fayned thing. And they that thus doo
faith S. Paule,1, Tim. 6, 3 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 
                  doo not agree with
the holy doctrine of Chriſte: but are
proude, and can doo nothing but
multiplie wordes, whereof commeth
contention, blaſphemie, euill ſurmiſings,
and many other euills. Thinking
it great honour to God, and a
deede of charitie to gather riches, and
to encreaſe the temporall patrimony:
but the very riches in deede, is to
vſe the deedes of chriſtian charity, being
cōtent with meate, drink & cloth
or what els pleaſeth God to ſend.
               
            
            
               The properties and effectes of this noble
Image of Loue.
Chapter. 7.
               THis Image of Loue,1, Cor, 13, 4, 5, 6, as S. Paule
deſcribeth it,The conditions of the true & perfect Image of Loue. 
                  is very patient, meek,
& gentle of countenance, charitable
without enuy to any perſon: it doth
no wrong: it is not rigorous nor blowen
ful of pride: it pretēdeth no ambition:
neither loketh for honour or
dignity, it requireth not profit for it
ſelfe, but onely to profitt other: it

hath no angry countenaunce. &c.
               
               Vnpoſſible is it for this diuine Image
to imagine any ill, for it is greatly
diſpleaſed with euil dooing, and chéerfully
reioyſeth in truth and goodnes,
it is very ſtrong to endure all trobles
and aduerſities, it beléeueth all truth,
tought it be aboue reaſon, it hath good
hope in all thinges that God promiſeth,
it is ſtedfaſt and perſeuerant, bearing
patient all maner of croſſes and
calamities, til better may be, it neuer
vadeth or fayleth, but the longer it endureth,
the more orient & goodly are
the colours thereof, and the more
ſtrength and vertue it hath, and the
more pleaſant it is to behold.S. Gregorye. S. Gregory
ſayth, it is ſo goodly a thing, that
no creature can prayſe it ſufficiently
as it deſerueth, nor haue the ful knowledge
of it in this life, to diſcribe it as
it is, it worketh maruailous thinges,
great, waighty & ſubſtantiall in effect.1. Cor, 13, 10.
It hath this mighty operatiō, y• whatſoeuer
is doone or wrought wher it is
preſent, it is ſufficient & good, though
ſomtime it ſéeme euill to ſome men, &
contrariwiſe, all thinges yt are doone,
where it is not preſent, although it ap

neuer ſo good, yet is it ſtarke: naught,
and of no value.Collo. 3, 15 
                  It vniteth & maketh
many men all one body, and knitteth
them ſo faſt together, that nothing can
ſunder thē.1, Pet, 4, 8 
                  It couereth the multitude
of ſins:
                  1, Ioh, 4, 18, 
                  and redeemeth our forfaits &
tranſgreſſions. Whoſoeuer hath thys
vertuous Image liuely engrauen in
his hart,No harme can happen to any man that entertayneth this true Image of Loue. ſhall not néede to feare anye
perrill whatſoeuer, neither may anie
iudgment goe againſt him, or anye
thing doo him harme: for it gyueth
light in darknes, cauſeth ioy in heauines,
mirth in ſadnes, in paine it prouoketh
glad patience, there can bee no
wrong or iniurie offered where it
dwelleth, it aſſwageth hunger and
thirſt, it maketh bond men frée, poore
men rich,Oſee, 11, 4 ſick men whole & ſound, yea
& ſometime it raiſeth the dead to life,
it is ſo attractiue, ye it draweth al good
things vnto it, and then maketh all
thinges common. Sometime it hath a
ſharp & rigorous countenance vppon
ſinners, but neuer is it mallicious or
enuious: for it morneth wt morners, it
reioiſeth with them y• be glad in God,
it gréeueth with penitent and ſorrowfull
offendours, it taketh away all

ſuſpitious and miſiudging from the
hart of man, it abhorreth all ſtrife, eurye,
murmure and contention, it hateth
all ill, and loueth all that is good,
there is nothing that pleaſeth God
more then this diuine Image of loue,Nothing that the deuill is more deſirous to deſtroy thē this Image of Loue.
and without it nothing can pleaſe
him, there is nothing whereof the deuill
is more deſtrous, then the deſtruction
of it, and to that intent he applyeth
all his labour, craft and ſubtilty,
with moſt extreame mallice, in ſeeking
both night and day to iniury and
ſupplant this glorious loue, or rather
diuine and immortall charity.
               But now looking in the Glaſſe of
holy Scripture, for this Image of ſo
high and worthy excellencie, perceyuing
my blindnes, mine ignoraunce,
mine vnkindnes, mine vnworthines,
wretchednes and preſumption: I
greatlie feare rather to gette ſhame
and reproofe, then thankes for myne
enterpriſe, ſéeing this Image ſo excellent,
ſo beautiful, ſo full of vertue and
grace, ſo farre excéeding the prayſes
and commendations of all men, and
yet I wretch moſt ſimple, and without

learning, preſume thus to ſhewe
this heauenly Image, that am moſte
vnſkilfull, and leaſt able to ſpeake of
the verie ſmalleſt prayſe which is due
vnto it.
               Neuertheleſſe, as I ſayde before, a
blind man may bolde foorth a picture
for other to beholde, if it be put into
his hande, albeit he handle it groſlye,
and ſhew it very rudely, his diſhability
is to be borne withall. In lyke
manner, though blindly and ignorant
lie I preſume to borrowe of other holie
Doctours this golden Image, onely
to ſhewe it vnto you, who I verily
thinke can better diſcerne it then I,
and therefore the more able to ſhewe
it me. Notwithſtanding you may
happen to receiue ſmall pleaſure here
in, by reaſon of my vnſkilfulneſſe in
handling ſo great a matter: I truſt
yet at the leaſt you will be content to
ſée the ſimple Image of mine owne
loue towards you, and to couer the
rudenes and ſmall value thereof, vnder
my chriſtian and zealous intent,
which wants no good wyll to doo it
better if I could.
            
            
               
               That this Image of loue is a lyuing
thing, exampled and taking forme
the inuiſible Image of God.
Chapter. 8.
               
                  I Sayd before that this Image is a
lyuing thing, and cannot be ſounde
among theſe deade and ſuperſtitious
reliques and figures. There is one
which S. Paule ſpeaketh of.Col, 3, 11▪
                   
                  Qui est
Imago Dei inuiſibilis, An Image of
God inuiſible and incomprehenſible,
the Sonne of God,
                   by whom he hath
made all creatures,Howe God ſhewed vs this Image of Loue, and man moſt ſingularly
vnto his Image and ſimilitude,
and becauſe hee was inuiſible, &
incōprehenſible, he tooke a glaſſe, meaning
our nature which wel may be cō
                  pared
to a brittle glaſſe, wherein hee
ſhewed vs this Image of loue, which
is himſelfe: in whom though there appeared
infinite power & wiſdome, yet
charity ſurpaſſed all, cheefely to our
behole.Col, 3, 10 
                  For that putteth away the old
Image of death in our ſoules, and reneweth
his Image againe in vs, and
made it quick through his Image of
loue, without which we are but dead.
as ſ. Iohn ſaith.1, Ioh, 4, 14 
                  Qui nō diligit mants in

morte. He that loueth not abideth in
death. Thus we may ſée in part an Image
of loue, yt is charitable, wc is god
himſelf, & the life of our ſoules, whom
we cannot wel ſée, but by the glaſſe of
his humanitie. A glaſſe ſheweth not ye
Image ſo much as it is, no more can
we cōſider his loue ſo great as it is. A
glaſſe can repreſent nothing but whē
ſomwhat is preſent to it, ſo in mā can
be no charity but if God be preſent vnto
his ſoule,1, Ioh, 4, 16 for Deus charitas eſt, et qui
manet in charitate, in Deo manet, et De
us in eo, God is charitie, and hee that
dwelleth in charity dwelleth in God,
                  
                  This is to be vnderſtoode of ſuch, as giue themſelues ouer to ſerue ſinne. 
                  and God in him. In whō ſoeuer God
is, be doth no ſin: if he doo ſin, God is
gone from him, if God be gone, this
Image is loſt and gone from him, as
in the materiall glaſſe, the perſon that
was preſent to it going away, the Image
in the glaſſe ceaſeth, and hath
no being. And thē foorthwith the deuil
is ready to preſent himſelfe in the
glaſſe, placing his contagious perſonne
therein: which ſo infecteth the
glaſſe, that it is harde to purge it,
and to polliſhe it cleere agayne, to
make it apt and able to receyue the

glorious Image of God againe, except
it hee doone ſpéedily and in due time,
yet very often the glaſſe is ſpoyld and
broken, before it can be made cleane
and pure againe. Remember therfore
that God is alwayes preſent in euery
place,
                  Heb, 4. 13 
                  and neuer withdraweth hys
loue from man:
                  Math, 5, 24 
                  But many wayes prouoketh
them, yea his enemies to loue
and maketh hys Sunne of grace and
righteouſnes to ſhine vppon euerye
perſon good and ill. The grace of
Chriſt and his doctrine is the lyght,
kéepe the glaſſe of our ſoules towards
thys light, turne it not away towards
darknes, and this heauenly Image
ſhall alwayes continue in the glaſſe.
Saint Iohn ſayth. Qui diliget fratrem
ſuum,
                  1, Io. 2, 10, 11 
                  in 
                        〈◊〉
                      manet, et ſcandulum in

                        •
                     o non est. He that loueth his brother
abideth in the light, and there is no
occaſion of euill in him. Qui autem edit
fratrem ſuum, in tenebris eſt, et in t
                        •
                     
nobris ambulat, et neſcit quo eat, quia
tenebra obc
                        •
                     cauerunt oculos eius. But he
that hateth his brother, is in darknes
and walketh in darknes, and cannot
tell whether he goeth. Thus turning

his glaſſe cleane from the light he falleth
ſometime into the myre of other
mens ſinnes, by ſuſpecting, iudging
or talking of theyr defaultes: ſometime
among the ſerpents of ſlaunder,
detraction and enuie: ſometime among
the thornes, bryers and wylde
beaſtes of couetouſnes, mallice, and
wrath: ſometime ſtumbling among
ſwyne, in the foule trough & ſtincking
gore of gluttonie, and beaſtly luſtes
of the body, with many other perillous
wayes, wandering with great
ieopardie into the depth of the ſoule,
becauſe that darknes hath blinded
his eyes:
                  The cauſe why this euill inconuenience happeneth to man. which is not in default of
the light of grace, nor for the charitie
of God is not preſent: but becauſe the
glaſſe of the ſoule is turned from the
light of heauen, which makes it ſo infected
and defiled with thys horrible
darknes, that it is altogether vnapt
to receiue the light of grace, and the
true Image of charitie, as I ſayd before,
for it is hard to remooue ye foule
deadlie Image of ſinne, and vnpoſſible
for any to doo it, but onely he that
is the author of life, and maker of this

incomprehenſible glaſſe.
               If we wyll turne our ſelues again
vnto the light, and faithfullie renewe
our loue towards him and our neighbours:
then ſhall wee receiue this Image
of eternall life againe, and ſay
with S. Iohn.1, Ioh, 3, 14 
                  Nos ſcimus quonicum
tranſlati ſumus de morte ad vitam, quoniam
diligimus fratres. We know that
we are tranſlated from death vnto
life, becauſe we loue the brethren.
                  
And this loue muſt be to euery perſon
as to our own proper ſelues, with
out fraude or diſſimulation.1, Ioh, 4, 20 
                  Qui enim
non diligit fratrem ſuum quem videt: Deum
quem non videt, quomodo potest diligere?
For howe can hee that loueth
not his brother whom he hath ſeene,
loue God whom hee hath not ſeene.
Et hoc mandatum habemus a Deo: Vt
qui diligit Deum, diligat et fratrem ſuum.
                     
                     1, Ioh, 4, 21, 
                     And this commaundement haue
we of God: that hee which loueth
him, ſhould loue his brother alſo.
                  
               
               Therefore I may ſaie that Loue is a
liuing Image, and the ſpyrite of life,
that onely giueth life to the bodye.
And as the body hath fiue wits, wherby

he ordereth all his workes: euen
ſo hath the ſoule fiue ſpiritual wittes,
whereby ſhe worketh all thinges that
are pleaſing and acceptable in y• ſight
of God.
            
            
               That this lyuing Image of Loue hath
fiue ghoſtly wittes, and the operations
of them.
Chapter. 9.
               OF theſe fiue wittes,S. Bernard in Sermo. Saint Bernard
ſpeaketh in one of his Sermons
ſhewing that there are fiue maner
of Loues. The firſt is a reuerende
and liuelie loue of parents and kinſfolkes.
The ſeconde is the affecting
loue of our neighbours, and they that
dwell together. The thirde is rightwiſe
loue, that we ought to haue to euery
reaſonable perſon. The fourth
is violent loue of our enemies. The
fift is holy and deuout loue of God aboue
all.
               
                  
Theſe fiue Loues may well be compared
to the fiue bodily wittes or ſences,
A compariſon betwen the bodily wits and the fiue loues. and great reſemblaunce may bee
diſcerned betwéen them, if we marke
what agréement they haue together.
               The Loue of Parents and kindred,
1. The loue of kindred, with ſence of touching accordeth well with the ſence of
touching, for this ſence pertaineth
moſt and onely to the fleſh: ſo y• Loue
is ſhewed to none, but ſuch as are
néere allied together, touching carnall
conſanguinitie. And as the ſence of
touching is in the fleſh, and in euerye
part of the body: ſo this loue is in euery
thing that hath life, as well the
Iewes and Pagans loue their kinne,
as Chriſtian men doo, yea beaſts and
Serpents alſo loue theyr kinne and
of-ſpring.
               The ſecond loue of Neighbours,2. The loue of neighbors, wyth the ſence of taſting. agréeth
properly with the ſence of taſting,
becauſe of the great ſwéetnes
and pleaſure that is therein, & becauſe
it is moſt néedefull and appertayning
to mans life. For I cannot ſée by reaſon,
howe a man ſhould liue well, eyther
bodily or ghoſtly in this worlde,
except he loue thoſe perſons that hee

liueth among, and he againe he likewiſe
loued of them, which maketh the
beſt harmony and louely hearing, that
can be deuiſed among Chriſtians.
               The generall Loue,3. The loue of all men with the ſence of ſmelling. whereby of
right we muſt loue euery man, may
be compared with the ſence of ſmelling,
in ſo much as this ſence perceyueth
thinges ſomewhat further of,
then the ſence of taſting doth or can,
and it hath in it ſelfe not ſo great pleaſure
and delectation, yet notwithſtanding
it is very pleaſant and neceſſary.
So this loue extendeth not onely to
our Neighbours, but to them that bee
ſomewhat further off, which in bréefe
ſtretcheth to all mankinde.
               The ſence of hearing diſcerneth
thinges a great deale further off,4. The loue of our enemies, with the ſence of hearing. then
doth the other inferiour ſences, ſo like
wiſe among men in this world, there
is none further a ſunder, then he that
loueth one who loueth not him againe,
but rewardeth him with mallice
and hatred, for in other ſences
there is alwayes ſome delectation,
and ſome néerenes in working to the
fleſh: but the hearing in manner goeth

out from the fleſh, as not hauing
anie pleaſure and delectation in the
fleſhe. And therefore it may be verye
well reſembled to the violent looue,
that is onely cauſed by the obedience
of Gods commaundement, which biddeth
vs to loue our enemies, which obedience
appeareth euidently to appertaine
to the ſence of hearing, wher
the great occaſion and cauſe of other
loues, that I haue ſpoken of, are taken
of the fleſh, that is of nature and
kinde.
               But the ſight aboue all other,5. The loue of god, with the ſence of ſeeing. chalengeth
to it ſelfe the ſimilitude of the
diuine and holy loue of God, in that it
is moſt excellent, of a ſingular nature,
more cléere and ſpirituall then all other
ſences, and diſcerneth thinges
moſt farre off, and knoweth the difference
of manie thinges.
               For though the ſmelling and hearing
doo perceyue thinges ſomewhat
farre off: yet it is more by drawing
to of the ayre, that commeth from the
obiect or thing that ſmelleth or ſoundeth
well or ill. But the ſight dooth
not ſo, but it ſeemeth rather to goe

foorth and procéede to thinges verye
farre off, as it may be figured in theſe
manners of louing. Héereby we doe
in manner drawe vnto vs our neighbours,
whom we loue as our liues,
receiuing profit and pleaſure by them
We drawe to vs alſo our enemies,
whom we loue for this cauſe, that
they might be as we be,The manner how we ought to loue God that is to ſay,
our fréendes. But if we loue God, as
it is our dueties we ſhould doo, namely,
with all our ſoule, with all our
ſtrength, with all our minde, we goe
from our ſelues vnto him, we bye vs
faſt and moſt ſwiftly, as the eye doth
to the moſt delectable obiect, we caſte
all our loue to him, who is the moſte
vnſpeakable hygh goodneſſe, aboue
vs and all creatures, hauing no
reſpect to our owne profit or pleaſure
no more then the eie can reflect the
ſight to ſée it ſelfe.
               But to take it for the moſt high
perfection and delight, onely to beholde
and loue him, in whom we may
perfectlie and abſolutely beholde our
ſelues and all creatures.
               
                  
This is perfection enough, and pleaſure
largely ſuffiſing, what neede we
to looke for other, ſith there is none
but this witneſſe Chriſte Ieſus himſelfe
in the Goſpell of Saint Iohn.
Haec est autem vlta aterna,
                  Ioh, 17, 3 
                  vt cognoſcant
te ſolum Deum verum, et quem miſisti
Ieſum Christum. This is the verye
cauſe and beginning of life euerlaſting,
to know and loue thee the onely
true God, and him that thou haſt
ſent Ieſus Chriſt thy ſonne, one God
with thee.
               
               And as by the ſight is gotten the
greateſt cunning and knowledge, euen
ſo by this loue is obtayned ye moſt
perfect perſeuerance, and ſure knowledge
of all thinges good and neceſſary
to be knowne.As the ſight is the cheefeſt ſence, ſo the loue of God is aboue all other loues. Likewiſe as yee
behold in the bodily ſences, the ſight
doth principally excell all the other,
the hearing excéeding the other three,
and ſo one is better in dignitye, and
more noble then another, after the
order and diſpoſition of the organes
and members that they be in: So in
like manner the loue of God is moſte
high, moſt excellent of all loues, and

of greateſt worthines. The looue of
our enemy next vnto this former, is
beſt in rewarde. The iuſt loue of euerie
perſon one to another, the more
it is extended and ſhewed, the more
worthy and acceptable is it in yt ſight
of God. The loue of our neighbors,
kindred, fréendes, and companions, is
very neceſſary, as thoſe other ſences
are, whichif they fayled, the life were
maymed and impeached, and all the
other ſences of loue ſhould decay. If a
man lacke taſting and féeling, howe
can he heare, ſée, or yet liue: if he cannot
loue his kindred; his neighbours
and companions that hee is dayly among,
1, Ioh, 4, 20 ho we can he loue. God or hys
enemie, or loue in the ſtate of grace?
truely it cannot be.
               Therfore theſe two loues be very
neceſſary, and except they be grounded
in a better reſpect then of nature, they
be but little worth: and yet the lacks
of them, or hatred contrary to them,
is more vnworthy then the contrarye
of the other two Loues next aboue,

and to our enemies. And becauſe that

theſe two, the loue to our neighbours,
kindred and companions, may be readilie
and vnawares diſordered (as we
may ſee dailie by common experience)
it is as harde to order diſcreetelie
the taſting of our meates & drinks,
as alſo the motions and appetites of
the fleſh: therefore it is neceſſarye to
looke aduiſedly, that they be not inordinate,
carnall, or for pryde and ambition,
leaſt they diminiſh or deſtroy
the other ſences of loue, prouoking to
more exceſſe of ſinne and intemperancie.

                   forſooke his goods, hys
kindred, and his countrie, for that hee
would not be deceiued by thys loue,
and ſo did manie other holie fathers,
as we haue in the examples and doctrines
of our Sauiour: Chriſte, and
which you may reade in diuers places
of Scripture. The Prophet Dauid

ſaid.Pſal. 44, 12 
                  Obliuiſcere populam tuum, et domum
patrit tui▪ Forget thy carnal loue,
thy country folkes, and thy fathers
houſhold. Et concupiſcet Rex decorem

tuum. And the King of all kings ſhal
be in looue with the beauty of thy
ſoule. Therefore it is neceſſarie, to
loue diſcréetlie, ſo that we loue euerie
creature in God, and for God, after
the goodnes of it, not for profitte and
pleaſure, for ſo the Catte loueth the
Mouſe. And not to loue the thing too
much, which is leaſt of all to be eſteemed,
nor to make light regard of that,
which we ought to loue moſt effectually,
for in true loue is no diuerſitie,
or exception of perſons, or any craft
or deceit, but according as S. Paule
ſayth.1. Ioh, 3, 18 
                  Non diligamus verbo, neque lingua,
ſed opere et veritate. Let vs not
loue in word, neither in tongue: but
indeede and in verity, euery perſon
according to theyr goodneſſe and vertue.

of this glorious Image, & the place
where is ought to be ſet.
Chapter. 10.
               THus haue I ſhewed you, that
thys glorious and diuine Image

of loue is a lyuing Image, by reaſon
of the ghoſtly and ſpirituall ſences it
hath,If charity leaue the ſoule, al the ſences of loue doo decay. for as the ſoule, if it depart from
the body, all the ſences and powers
fayle and decay: euen ſo, if charity depart
from the ſoule, all theſe ſences of
loue muſt néedes perriſh and come to
nothing, and then remayneth ye foule
deade. This is the Image all godly
perſons delight in, and haue great pleſure
and felicity to be hold it. Thys is
the lyuing Image, portrayed in the
Scripture like a Queene, and is in
déede the dery Queene of all vertues,
vppon whom all faythfull Chriſtians
ought daily to fixe their eyes, and neuer
to leaue looking on her. Thys is
the Quéene that ſtandeth alwayes on
the right hand of God, as the prophett
Dauid ſayth.Pſal. 44, 11 
                  In vestitu de aurato, circundata
varietate. In apparell goodly
guilt, ſet about with diuerſity of orient
colours, and precious ſtones of
vertues and gifts of grace, with borders
and hemmes of gold. In thys Image
ſhoulde all zealous affected ſoules,
that be the true and faythful ſpouſes
of Chriſt, haue theyr glory and delyght,

and not in paynted clothes,The Papiſts reuerence to their paltry Images, but a counterfeit deuotion, and meere ſuperſtition. or
carued and grauen Images, ſet about
with diuerſity of byrdes, beaſtes and
foules, which is but a groſſe and coloured
deuotion, or more aptly to ſpeake,
a meere, fond, and fooliſh ſuperſtition:
and let them haue ſuch delight, who
féele no taſte of glory and comfort inwardly
in theyr ſoules, by teſtimonye
of a good conſcience, ſuch as haue no
zeale to perfect méekenes, and feruent
loue of God, and cannot ioy or delight
themſelues, but onely in earthly and
tranſitory thinges.
               But you that be Kinges, and Noble
mens ſonnes and daughters, yea,
all we that profeſſe the glorious and
triumphant name of Chriſte Ieſus,
ſhould principally haue our glory inwardlie,
and from the very harte.Pſal. 44. 15 
                  In
fimbriis aureis, circumamicta varietatibus.
In hemmes and borders of gold,
                  
that is to ſay, godly and continual perſeueraunce
in true loue and patience,
which is true gold indeede, ſurely approoued
and tryed in the fire of trouble
and aduerſity: apparelled and clothed
round about with colours of diuers

vertues, ſo conueniently, and ſo religiouſlie
ſet in order in the hart, as
one ſetteth forth another meruailous
gloriouſly, and the beauty of one increaſeth
by the noble vertue of the other,
and that beautie which nature
it ſelfe affoordeth it, is of ſo little ſplendour
and orient appearaunce in ſight,
as beeing placed among the other
rich vertues, it ſeemeth a thouſande
times more goodlie and precious. Put
diligence to obedience,An example wel worthy the noting, touching the apparell of this goodly Image. and nothing
can be more pleaſant: let meekenes
be ioyned with chaſtitie, and nothing
is more ſplendaunt: vnite patience
with pouertie, and nothing canne bee
more delectable: running coupled
with lowlines and gentlenes, what
is more beautifull? ſet Iuſtice and
mercy together, and what better company?
benignitie placed with magnyficence,
is a royall pearle in the eye of
the beholder: ſadnes or grauity dooth
meruailouſly well, and diſcretion mixed
among all theſe, maketh the whole
veſture goodly, ſure and profitable.
And aboue all theſe is the rich gylt
garment that I did ſpeake of, namely,

godly wiſedome, which is not in geſting
riches, pleaſure and honours:
but in ſetting them at naught, and deſpyſing
both them and all other earthlie
thinges. It is in compunction of
hart, and zealous contrition for our
ſinnes and offences, in daily exerciſe
of godlie and charitable works, and in
continuall meditation and contemplation
of immortall and heauenly thinges,
in ſtudy of holie Scripture, the
lawe of God, and to frame our life
and conuerſation thereafter. The
hemme of this veſture is perſeuerant
loue, according as Saint Paul ſayth:
Finis praecepti, est charitas de corde puro,
                  1. Tim. 1, 5. 
                  et conſcientia bona, et fide non ficta.
The end of the commaundementes
of God, is charitie or perſeueraunt
loue, comming from a pure hart, and
a good conſcience, and from a fayth
vnfayned, this is the extreame parte
of godly wiſedome, wherein is ſette
great plentie of precious ſtones and
Iewels, the xii. articles of ye fayth, the
ſeauen gifts of grace, and many other
ineſtimable treaſures. The white
kercher vppon the heade, is ſure hope,

made by the workes of cleannes and
deedes of pyttie, and whited with
the dewe of grace from Heauen aboue.
               Loe thus haue I heere diſcourſed
the habite and ornaments of thys
Image of Loue,A good admonition how to behaue our ſelues towards thys Image of loue. occupy the eyes of
our mindes in beholding theſe varieties,
and you that bee the very Temples
of God, ſet vp therein the Altare
of your harts, and there make your
ſacrifice and prayers: for euen nowe
is the time that Chriſt ſpake of to the
Woman of Samaria, ſaying: Mulier

                  for man lookketh
on the outwarde appearaunce,
but the Lord beholdeth the hart and
iudgeth thereafter. Againe, Non ſecundum

auditum aurium argu
                        ••
                      &c. And
he ſhall iudge not after the outward
ſeeing of mans eyes, nor after the
hearing of the eares: but after the very
right, and after the thought and
intent of man:
                   Therefore if a man
take héede, and be wary what he doth
in the ſight of man, much more ought
he to be careful what he doth in ye ſight
and preſence of almighty God.It is not the garment that maketh men holy, but the intent of the hart within When
the body is clothed in a religious veſture
we thinke it well, and as beſeemeth:
but what doth it help or auaile
if ye mind beare ſtil a ſecular and ſinful
habit, after the manner and faſhion of
the world? ſuch kéepe ſilence outwardly,
& ſéeme in the eies of men as ſaints

but let them looke that the mind with
in be at reſt from vaine thoughts, and
not cloyd or choked with worldly imaginations,
els all their holines is to
ſmal purpoſe. In the material Temple,
we knéele and ſtoupe lowe to the
ground: but what doth that profit vs,
if in y• inward temple of our ſoule we
ſtand ſturdily & vnreuerently againſt
God and our ſuperiors, in diſobeying
his or their commandements?An excellent note for faſting & abſtinēce Some
faſt and abſtaine from many thinges,
which are good, and of themſelues doo
not defile man: but ſhoulde they not
rather refraine from ſuſpition, detraction,
and from all euill ſpeaking one
of another? which indéede polluteth
and defileth both other mens conſciences,
and their owne alſo. Many doo
make gaye and adorne the materiall
temple or Church, and ſhewe great
reuerence and deuotion in it: but to
what end is that,Ezech, 8, 10, ſaith y• prophet Ezechiel,
When the temple of their ſoule
is ful of ſerpents, Idols & abhominations
of Egipt? that is, euill and vncleane
thoughts, well worthy to be auoided
and ſuſpended.
               
                  
Wee ſing and praiſe God with our
tongue, let vs looke that wee doo ſo
likewiſe with our heart and minde.
We ſpeake fayre and deuoutly wyth
our mouth: let vs meane as well in
our ſoules, or els it is not well. The
body is kept and contained within a
little houſe or Cell: let not the minde
then be wandering about y• huge wide
world.It is much better to confeſſe our ſinnes before God then before a ghoſtly father. Wee account it well doone of
vs, if we vſe oftentimes to accuſe our
ſelues of our ſinnes, before a Prieſte
our ghoſtly father: but it is much better
doone, and more auayling to our
ſoules health, when we doo ſecretelie
and earneſtly accuſe and confeſſe our
ſinnes to God, with a true, penitent
and vnfeygned hatred of them, and
with a zealous and labouring intent
to forſake them, for the true loue and
feare of God: for an inwarde wounde
muſt haue an inward medicine, and
none is able to forgiue ſinne, but hee
that with the breath of his mouth confoundeth
ſinne, and treadeth triumphantly
vpon death, hell and damnation.
               If ye come to heare the worde of

God, which is the moſt neceſſary and
onely foode of the ſoule:Math, 13, 14 heare it inwardly,

But heare Gods word ſo outwardly,
that you may ſaie with the Prophet
Dauid.Pſal, 84, 8, 
                  Audiam quid loquatur in me
Dominus Deus. I wyll hearken what
the Lord God ſpeaketh in me,
                   wyth
feruent deſire to accompliſh in deede,
that which is ſhewed in word, that it
may be ſaid vnto you,Luk, 11, 28 
                  Bleſſed are they
which heare the worde of God, and
keepe it. that is as much to ſay, as we
ſhould heare it with the eare of obedience,
Pſal. 44, 15 which eare Dauid exhorteth
the Kings daughter to incline, ſhee
whoſe beauty was inwardlie in hemmes
of Gold, as I ſpake before.
               This haue I ſayd, that we ſhoulde
not leane or truſt too much to outward
obſeruaunces and ceremonies,
otherwiſe then the word of truth doth
aſſigne: whereto I add, that they bee
alſo little or nothing acceptable, without
the inward and deuout workyng
goe therewith. We may not leaue of
the honourable and deuout cuſtomes

and holye ordinaunces of the Church.
Haec oportuit facere,
                  Math, 23, 23 
                  et illa non omittere,
Theſe ought ye to haue doone, &
not to leaue the other vndoone,
                   as
the outwarde muſt not bee left off, ſo
the other, béeing the holy and inward
obſeruaunces, are much more neceſſarie,
and they muſt néedes bee doone, if
we will haue anie profit of them. S.
Iohn therefore ſayth in his Goſpell.
Spiritus est Deus,
                  Ioh, 4. 24 
                  et eos qui adorant eum,
in ſpiritu et veritate oportet adorare.
God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhyp
him, muſt worſhip him in ſpyrit,
                  
                  Math, 25, 12, 
                  and in trueth. Remember wee not
the fooliſh Virgins, who had Lampes
of goodlie works outwardlie, but they
wanted that they ſhould haue had inwardly,
I meane the Oyle of diuine
grace: which was the cauſe the bride
groome knewe them not, and ſo they
were excluded from the marriage.
               Therfore reare vp an altar in your
inward temples, euen in the very bottom
and depth of your harts, you that
be the lyuing temples of God, there
ſet vp lights of heauenlie knowledge,
gette you learning bothe by doctrine

and grace, whereby you may worke,
teach and ſhewe examples of light:
make there your oblations of a méeke
and contrite hart: there make a ſwéet
ſauour to God, with y• burning coles
of vnſpotted loue, and ſwéete incenſe
of deuotion: there knéele méekely
with reuerent inclinations: there
make your proteſtations, with lowlie
feare & earneſt compunction of hart:
there erect vp your glorious Image
of loue: there vſe your meditations
and contemplations, and there behold
thoſe two Images whereof I ſhewed
you before.
               The one is a goodlie great Image,
increat and incomprehenſible,
that is GOD himſelfe,1, Ioh, 4, 4 
                  Deus charitas
est, God is loue.
                   The other our
owne little Image, our little loue,
created and cauſed by the Image of
God, as a little Image in a glaſſe: but
yet it is verie precious and good, by
meanes wherof the ſoule hath lyfe, &
the ghoſtly ſences yT I ſpake of. And
though our loue bee verie little, & nothing
in compariſon of y• other diuine
Image, which is infinite, & not to bee

equalled, in that it excéedeth all thinges
whatſoeuer. Yet hee wyll haue
ours vnto the likenes of his loue, ſaying:
Hoc mand
                        •
                      vobis, vt diligatis in Uicem
ſicut dilexi vos.
                  Ioh, 15, 17, 
                  This I commaund
you, that you loue together, as I haue
loued you. And many times he inciteth
to loue one another, and teacheth
howe, ſaying: Sicut dilexit me pater, et
ego dilexi vos. Manete in dilectione
mea.
                  Ioh. 15, 9 13, 14, 
                  As the father hath loued mee, euen
ſo haue I loued you. Continue
you in my loue. Agayne. Greater
loue then this hath no man, that a
man beſtowe his life for hys freends,
yee are my freendes if you doo what
ſoeuer I commaund you. And a number
like examples hath hee left vs of
hys euerlaſting loue, that wee myght
frame ours thereby towardes our
neighbours: which becauſe it is of ſo
great valewe and eſtimation, let vs
yet ſpeake ſomewhat more thereof,
and hold our labour well ſpent in diſcourſing
on ſo ſpeciall a matter.Loue is the whole perfection of a chriſtian man. If
wee wyll conſider what is the fountayne,
life and ſoule of mans vertue,
and the very roote of all hys chriſtian

actions: you ſhall ſée that it is onely
the true loue of Gods. And whoſoeuer
hath his minde inwardly and thorow
lie inflamed with the loue, of GOD:
hee is the bleſſed man that kéepeth
Gods word, that fulfilleth al his law,
that neuer willeth the dooing of euill,
and euer delighteth in dooing well.
This loue of God that cauſeth ſuch
perfections in man,What the perfect loue of God is, and the ſtate therof is likewiſe called
charity, and he loueth not God perfectly
that is without this charity. The
perfect loue of GOD cannot ſtande
with any care or ſtudy for this lyfe:
the perfect loue of God abydeth not
the coupling with any other loue: the
perfect loue of God knoweth no affection
to kindred: it knoweth no difference
betwéene poore and rich: it knoweth
not what meaneth thine and
mine, it can not diſtinguiſh a foe from
a fréende. For he that truely and perfectly
loueth God, muſt loue God alone,
nothing beſide God, nor wyth
God: but loue all indifferently in
God, and for God. We that ſay wee
loue God, when wee ſcant once a day
remember him, and yet neuer remember

wee God in ſuch manner, but that
more often and more earneſtly we remember
other things: in ſaying then
that we loue God, and dooing thus,
we are not able to prooue true what
we ſay.The diſcription of a true & perfect louer of God. For the perfect louer of God
is ſo wedded to God, that nothing abideth
in his thought but the quicke
and liuely remembraunce of God. As
for our ſpirites and ſences, they be occupied
with ſo many other matters,
that we can want 
                     ••
                  nd and leyſure to think
on God: ſo far 
                     〈◊〉
                   we from this perfect
loue, which is a vertue of that dignitie,
power and maieſtie, that in it

                  , all the Lawes of the
Prophets, all the doctrine of Chriſt,
and all the rules of the Apoſtles: yea,
more then all this, loue hath that preheminence,
as it is vnder no rule, but
is Lorde aboue all Lawes, all inuentions,
all precepts, and all commandements
that GOD hath giuen to
man: For loue hath no bond. But
you muſt alwayes remember, that
loue is not perfect, vnleſſe it vee burning.
               
                  
It is not a quenched loue, a colde
loue, or loue growing in the téeth or
lippes which I nowe ſpeake of: but
the hote burning harts affection towardes
God, this you muſt vnderſtand
to be perfect loue.
               The ende of all the courſe & walking
of the ſonne of God in this world,The whole time of Chriſt here on earth, was to plant this loue among men.
was to leaue héere among men thys
loue. The marke whereat our Sauiour
in all his preaching and teaching
aymed, was to haue men endued with
this loue. For our diuine Schoolemaſter
ſawe, that there néeded no rehearſall
of ſins which were to be eſchewed,
nor yet of vertues that were to be
followed, if men could lay ſure holde
on this loue: which of it ſelfe is ſufficient
to kéepe men from ſtumbling in
the way, from wandering out of the
way, and finally to conduct men to the
bleſſed waies ende, ſo that the compaſſe
and circuite of it is ſo wide, as it
comprehendeth al y• can be ſpoken eyther
againſt vice or with vertue. Yet
ſome think y• loue is nothing but to
kéepe patiēce, & not to be diſpleaſed or
angry, indéed this is one part of loue:

but not all, for whatſoeuer the loue of
God prouoketh vs to, or the feare of
God driueth vs from, all is concluded
in this perfect looue. Beſide, Saint
Auguſtine ſayth.S. Auguſtine his words concerning this diuine loue 
                  Loue is a good and
gracious effect of the ſoule, whereby
mans hart hath no fantaſy to eſteem,
value or ponder any thing in thys
wyde worlde, beſide or before the
care and ſtudie to knowe God. For
whoſoeuer is inclined to loue theſe
earthly thinges, ſo long as he ſo doth,
it is not poſſible for him euer to attayne
to the aſſured, conſtant & perfect
vſe of loue, becauſe his minde hath ſo
manie and ſo diuers hinderaunces,
that withdraw him from taking the
poſſeſſion of this great treaſure, wherin
is couched the heapes of all other
vertues. And a little more to ſpeake
of theſe impediments and lettes, it
ſhall much appertaine to my purpoſe:
for we ſhall the more eaſily come to
loue, if wee knowe and can eſcape all
the blocks that lye in our way to let
vs, not onely to keepe vs from thys
vertue, but alſo to driue and chaſe it
ſo farre from vs, that neither wee can

come to it, nor it to vs.
            
            
               Of the impediments and lets, that
keepe vs from this true Image
of diuine loue, and of diuers neceſſary
rules to be remembred.

vndoubted beléef
                     •
                   in Chriſt our Maiſter
his teaching. Thus from fayth
we come to feare, from feare to flying
from ſinne, and in flying from ſinne,
wee take a patient minde to ſuffer,
whereby we catch holde on hope and
truſt in God: through which hope,
our ſoule ſitteth in a ſure chayre of a
certayne expectation, of that which is
layde vppe in ſtore for vs in heauen.
And héereof finallie commeth this perfect
loue in vs, which cauſeth vs to
loue God, for his infinite goodnes in
the ſame promiſe making, whereof
nowe we wayte for the fulfilling: the
which is alſo the thing, that enforceth
and ordereth all our thoughts in
ſuch a due rule, that our life thereby
rendreth (in all our actions) a ſwéete
ſauour both to God and man.
               But let vs once repeate the effect
of this leſſon.Beleefe in Chriſt, with the repetition of the former leſſon. Whoſoeuer beléeueth
ſtedfaſtly in our Maſter Chriſte, hee
feareth his puniſhment, and hee that
feareth his puniſhment, refrayneth
himſelfe from ſenſual luſts, which be
the cauſes of puniſhment: hee that auoydeth

ſuch cauſes abideth well, and
contentedly endureth tribulation, hee
that patiently ſuffereth tribulation,
hath a bleſſed hope and truſt in God,
which draweth and plucketh ye minde
from worldly affections: and ye mind
once fréely diſcharged of all loue to
thys world, ſtrayte way taketh pure
burning loue towardes God, and that
maketh quietnes, reſte and peace in
our conſcience. Thus euery way wee
muſt reſolue our ſelues to reſt finally
in the poſſeſſion of loue, els wee can
neither beléeue or feare God as wee
ought to doo, nor refrayne euil luſtes,
nor ſuffer tribulation, nor hope in
God, nor leaue the loue of theſe worldly
dregges as we ought to doo: but in
theſe we ſhalbe drowned bothe night
and day, during the time of this lyfe,
from whence we ſhall paſſe into myſerable
condition of body and ſoule, to
endure without ende the indignation
of God, whom after this life we ſhall
neuer ſée, vnleſſe we can nowe for
his ſake deſpiſe this worlde, which exceedeth
the power of mans féeblenes
to doo, except he vſe the puiſſant might

of loue, which bringeth ſo feruent a deſire
towardes God, as nothing beſide
him is once thought on or regarded:
and ſuch a ſweetnes féeleth the charitable
minde in his deſire, that he wyll
not forgoe or diminiſh any part thereof,
although hee ſhoulde ſuffer a thouſand
hurtes and iniuries. Héere may
we remember the louing Diſciple of
Chriſt,Acts. 7, 60 Saint Stephen, howe he enflamed
with loue to God, prayeth aloude
for his tormenters, and craueth of
God remiſſion for theyr ſinnes, ſaying:
Domine ne statuas illis hoc peccatum.
Lord lay not this ſinne to theyr
charge,
                   alleadging theyr ignoraunce
for theyr excuſe. The bearing of Chriſtes
Croſſe, is made by this loue a
ſwéete yoke, and an eaſie burden, for
he that is vnited with God in perfect
loue, ſayth in all tribulations wyth
the prophet Ieremye.
                  Iere, 17, 16 
                  Non ſum turbatus
Domine ſequens te pastorem. Oh
Lord, in following thee my ruler, I
cannot be diſcomforted.
               
            
            
               
               How we ſhould know when we haue
this true and perfecte Image of
loue, and how to vſe it.
Chapter. 13.
               ALbertus ſaith, That a faithful &
humble ſoule (in manner) abhorreth
to loue God in reſpecte of reward
or profit,The ſaying of Albertus of an humble & fayth full ſoule. but as God gaue him
ſelfe freely to mans ſoule, looking for
no reward, but wylling and deſirous
to make man partaker of his bliſſe:
euen ſo a perfect louing ſoule ſhould
giue himſelfe feruentlie and freely to
God in loue, with all his ſtrength and
power, ſeeking no profit eyther tranſitorye
or euerlaſting: but onely to
ſette all his affection and loue vppon
God, for his high maieſty, goodnes,
power, wyſedome, holines, perfection
and bliſſe, that he is of by nature.
Hée that loueth God, becauſe he is
good and profitable to him, & becauſe
that principally he ſhould make him
partaker of his ioy and happines: he;

may be conuinced, that hee hath but
naturall and vnperfect looue. A very
proofe of loue and charitie: Chriſt putteth
himſelfe in the Goſpell after S.
Iohn,
                  Ioh, 14, 21 
                  ſaying: Qui habet mandata mea
et ſeruat 
                        •
                     a: ille est qui dilagis me. He
that hath my commaundements, and
keepeth them: the ſame is he that loueth
me. Wherevppon▪ ſayth Saint
Auguſtine:S. Auguſtine in ciuit, dei. Hee loueth God that keepeth
his commaundements, not that
he is compelled for feare of greate
payne, or for couetouſnes of ioy: but
becauſe the thing that is commaunded
is moſt good and holy.
               The loue of our neighbour likewyſe,
The loue of our neighbour muſt be without hope of reward. muſt be without any reſpect of
profit and reward, eſpecially if it bee
true loue, like vnto his that commandeth
vs, ſaying: Hoc est praceptum meum,
                  Iohn. 15, 12 
                  Vt diligatis inuicem, ſicut dilexi
vos. Thus is my commaundement,
That yee loue together as I haue looued
you.
               
               There be two euident ſignes of
loue towards God in vs. The firſt is,
when we ioy and gladly prayſe God
in all thinges that pleaſeth him, what

ſoeuer they be, whenſoeuer, of whomſoeuer,
and whereſoeuer they be don.
The other ſigne is: when a man is ſorye
in God for all thinges that be diſpleaſant
vnto him, whatſoeuer they
be▪ whenſoeuer, of whomſoeuer, or
whereſoeuer they be doone.
               An other rule of loue, our Sauiour
Chriſt putteth in the Goſpel after S.
Mathewe ſaying:Math, 22, 37 
                  Diliges Dominum
Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et in tota
anima tua, et in tota mente tua. Thou
ſhalt loue the Lord thy God wyth all
thy hart, and with all thy ſoule, and
with all thy mind.
                  With all thy hart. Thou ſhalt loue
God with all thy reaſon, with all thy
wyll, and with all thy mynd and memory.
With all thy reaſon without
any errour, ſubduing the witte and
vnderſtanding vnto the méeke ſeruice
of God: applying our ſtudy towardes
him, and enforcing our whole deſire
to the knowledg & ſight of him.With all thy ſoule. With
all thy ſoule and obedient wyll, that
is, when the feare of no tranſitorye
euill driueth vs from his obedience,
or loue of any worldly matters draweth

vs from his ſeruice. With all thy
mind and memory,With all thy mind. forgetting al thinges
that diſpleaſe God, and ſetting
our mind from all thinges that lette
and hinder his loue: as iniuries doon
vnto vs, which, when they he called to
remembraunce, are as yron left in a
wounde, which feſtereth and letteth
the healing of the wound.
               If wee will obtayne perfect looue,Foure manner of waies to ſubdue our reaſon to the obedience of God.
wee muſt ſubdue our reaſon and vnderſtanding
vnder the obedience of
God, and after hys mynde and wyll
foure manner of wayes.
               Fyrſt, in all thinges that pertayne
to the Fayth: wee muſt obeye
GOD and beleeue him. Whereof
Hillarius ſayth:S. Hillarius, 
                  Soli Deo de ſecredendum
est, qui ſe ſolus nouit. &c
Wee muſt beleeue onely GOD, of
thoſe things that belong to himſelfe,
for he onely knoweth himſelfe.
                  
               
               The ſeconde way, is to conſider
and iudge euill of our owne ſelues,
and well of all other.
               The thyrde, is to preferre y• minde
and ſentence of our betters and

ſuperiours, before our owne mindes,
and that moſt ſpecially is to be doone
in matters of religion concerning the
ſoule. The fourth way, is to bethink
our ſelues of our owne actions, and al
that belongeth to vs, and to turne away
our eyes from iudging & beholding
of other folkes manners and behauiour.
Wherevppon ſayth Saynt
Bernard: Keepe diligently thy ſelfe,
and that thou mayſt ſo doo, turne
away thy eyen from other mennes
deedes.
               
               The rule of charity towarde our
neighbour is,Math, 22, 39 
                  Diligis proximum tuum
ſicut teipſum.
                  Mark. 12, 31 
                  Thou ſhalt loue thy
neighbour as thy ſelfe, that is after
the opinion of Saint Auguſtine. Thy
freend as thy ſelfe, thyne enemye as
thy freend. And as euery man looueth
goods and honour, that is good to
himſelf in body and ſoule, and eſcheweth
or hateth his owne hurt and domage
in any of theſe foure: ſo ought
we to loue and be gladde of all that is
good anie of theſe waies in our neighbour,
both fréende and foe, and to hate
and be ſorrye for their hurt and hinderance.
               
               Notwithſtanding there is an order
in charitie, whereof the ſpouſe of
cHRIſt ſpeaketh in the 
                     〈…〉
                  .Cant. 2. 4,
                  He hath ſette
charity in me in an order. Which S.
Auguſtine declareth thus, Prima diligendum
eſ 
                        〈◊〉
                      ſupra nos est 
                        〈◊〉
                     . Fyrſt
we muſt loue God? aboue all, next
our owne ſoules, then our neighbor,
then our bodyes &c the bodyes of our
neighbours? 
                     〈◊〉
                   for 
                     〈…〉
                   goods,
he ſpeaketh not of the, for they ſhould
not be 
                     〈◊〉
                   but vſed as 
                     〈◊〉
                   bitter
pill or 
                     〈…〉
                   men declare
that we 
                     〈…〉
                   our neighbour as
our ſelfe, 
                     〈…〉
                  ,A notable example, how wee ſhould loue our neighbour. and
for God. 
                     〈…〉
                   purchaſed for him in the
kingdome of heauen, neyther with ſiluer

nor golde, but with the ſhedding
of hys moſt precious bloude. Therefore
to honour God very deuoutly in
time of proſperitye, and forgette him
agayne when he layeth any croſſe vpon
vs, declares that wee knowe not
what true charitie meaneth, neyther
is it well prooued in vs by looue of
freendes onely: for to loue other becauſe
they loue vs, belongeth to nature,
and is without reward, but is
loue them that loue not vs; commeth
of grace, and to drawe our 
                     〈◊〉
                   to
loue, by ſhewing benefitte; pleaſures,
and gyfts, appertayneth 
                     〈…〉
                  
and is acceptable in 
                     〈…〉
                  .
               I thinke there is nothing that maketh
vs ſo like vnto Chriſt our maiſter
(who is the very Image of loue)
as to loue our enemies,Nothing maketh vs ſo like vnto Chriſt as to loue our emies. and to be wel
pleaſed with them that reuile & ſpeak
euill of vs,Matth, 5, 44 yea ſuch as 
                     〈◊〉
                   vs wyth
continuall moleſtations and 
                     〈◊〉
                  
for thys I am ſure, that we ſhoulde
receyue more grace and glory in their
perſecuting vs, then in theyr diſſembling
falſhoode and fauour, if we could

vſe our ſelues in ſo good and diſcrete
order, and applye it well for the loue
of God.
               Thus dyd enemies and tyrants
much more aduaunce holy and religious
martyrs, towardes obtayning
theyr euerlaſtyng ioy and glory, then
all their freendes and fauourers coulde
doe, and the more they inflicted torture
and puniſhment on their bodies,
the more ſwéete and heauenly comfort
they receyued in theyr ſoules: agreeing
with his wordes, who is the
very author & fountayne of all trueth,
where he ſaith.
               Beati qui perſecutionem patiantur,Matth, 5, 10, 11, 12,
propter iustitiam: quoniam ipſorum est
Regnum calorum. Beati eſtis quum
male dicerint vobis homines, et perſecuti
vos fuerint, et dixerixt omne malum
aduerſum vos mentientes, propter me.
Gaudete et occultate: quoniam mercer
vestra copiaſa eſt in calis. Sit enim perſecuti
ſunt prophetas qui fuerunt ante
vos. Bleſſed are they which haue
beene perſecuted for righteouſneſſe
ſake: for theyrs is the kingdome of
Heauen.
               
               
                  
Bleſſed are yee when men ſhall reuile
you, and perſecute you, and lying,
ſhall ſay all manner of euill againſt
you or my ſake. Reioyce yee
and be glad: for great is your reward
in heauen. For ſo perſecuted they the
Prophets which were before you.
               The verye tokens of looue to our
neighbors,The true tokens of loue and hatred. are when we be ſorrye for
theyr hurt, payne and aduerſitye, as
well our fréends as our enemies: and
be as glad with all our hurt of theyr
profit, health and proſperity, which I
may ſay to you are two dainty birds,
and very hard and ſcant to be founde.
Nowe on the contrary, the very tokens
of hatred, mallice, 
                     〈◊〉
                   enuy are,
when it gréeueth a man to think well
of his neighbour, or to ſpeake to him,
when it is painfull to heire good of
him, and when he is deſirous to lette
and hinder that thing which ſhoulde
doo him profit, pleaſure and helpe, and
diligent to ſéeke his iniurie & harme,
detracting his good name,Chriſoſtōes words of enuy and malice. and ſlaundering
his honeſt actions. S. Chriſoſtome
ſayth: That when mallice
hath once gotten entraunce into a

mans hart al thinges that are ſpoken,
hearde or doone, in ſuch ſort are taken
and vnderſtoode, that they alway
increaſe the more mallice and
longer enmitie. If there be any thing
ſayde of the enemy that is good, it is
not beleeued, or els it is peruerted. If
any euill be ſpoken, that is forthwith
credited, confirmed and multiplied.
Thus did not Chriſt to Iudas that betrayed
him.
            
            
               A breefe diſcription of the portraite
of Enuie and mallice.
Chapter. 14.
               I Had not thought to haue ſpoken of
this deadly and deuilliſh Image of
Enuie and mallice, that is ſo ouglie,
pale and wan, becauſe in no wiſe it
may ſtande by this glorious Image of
loue, except it be troden vnder y• féete
thereof, as we ſée the pictures of the
deuill and perſecuting tyrants vnder
the féete of Saintes, to their vtter confuſion,
rebuke and damnation: but
becauſe Chriſoſtome bewrayed ſome

part thereof, I thought it not amiſſe
to adde to the reſt, that all men may
ſee what a cruell monſter it is, and
what a ſwéete comfort diuine loue is.
If I ſhould portrayte it like the deuil
it is worſe then bee:Mallice worſe then the deuill for through it
the deuill fell from heauen horriblye
deformed and daily his mallice increaſeth
through the ſame. If I ſhoulde
make it like Nero,
                  Worſe then Nero. yet is enuye
much worſe then hee: for Nero burnt
but a part of Rome, but thys enuye
hath ſette all the whole world on fire,
that it can hardlye bee quenched agayne.
               Compare it vnto Death, and it is
a great deale worſe then hee:Worſe then Death. for it
brought Death into the worlde, and
baniſhed man from glorious Paradiſe.
It flew Abell, and hath wrought
moſt of all the miſchiefe ſince the beginning
of the worlde. It was the
worker of Chriſtes death, and yet it
continueth daily more and more
againſt all his members. It was
the cruell beaſt that was ſuppoſed to
haue deuoured innocent Ioſeph.
                  Ouids deſcription of mallice. The
Poet Ouid diſcribed it like an olde

Trot, with a leane face, pale & wan,
the teeth blacke, a fiery tongue, the
mouth full of venome, the eyes hollowe,
neuer looking right forth, grim
and cruell of countenaunce, the breaſt
ſwollen full of poyſon, cruell nayles,
with bloodie handes and many other
euill proportions: but yet hee coulde
not deſcribe it ſo ill as it is indéede.
And becauſe I would all men ſhoulde
haue it in great contempt and deſpite
I wyll caſt it vnder the feete of thys
myne Image of glorious loue; as a
monſter made of all miſchiefe & wickednes.
               It hath the tayle of the Serpent
detraction, backbyting and ſlaunder,
whych is the ſame Serpent that the
Wiſe man ſpeaketh of:Eccle. 10. 10 
                  Qui mordet
in ſilentio. That ſtyngeth priuilye,
with the teeth and prickes of detraction,
ſlaunder and backbyting.
               
               It hath the féete and ſubtimes of a
Foxe, through hipocriſie, for a Foxe in
the wood neuer goeth forth right: but
ſometime on the one ſide, then on ye other,
and wil faine himſelfe deade: to
deceiue what he ſéekes for hys pray.
               
                  
                  Quaſi vulpes in deſerto, propheta tui
Iſrael erant.
                  Ezec. 13, 4 
                  O Iſraell, thy prophets
are like Foxes in deſert places. In
like manner theſe enuious hypocrites
are like Foxes in the wildernes, that
walke by ſubtill wayes leaſte they
ſhould be eſpied, and feigne thēſelues
holy and religious to deceiue the well
meaning, yet weake in knowledge.
It hath the belly of a Dragon, which
is idlenes, full of ſtincking thoughtes
and falſe imaginations: the breaſt of
a Lyon, proude and diſdainfull: the
head, partly like death, and partly
like the deuill: it hath holes in ſteede
of eyes like vnto death, for it hath
neither loue nor feare of God. It hath
the left eare like Nero, ready to heare
all euill, and ye right eare chopt awaie
like Malchus, and ſtopped or cloſed,
that it can heare no goodnes. The
mouth is wide,Pſal. 5. 10. 
                  like an open ſepulcher
or graue, full of filthy bones and
carion, & the tongue ſharp as a ſword,
and all on fire as hell:
                  Iam, 3, 6, the leaſt ſpark
whereof, is able to ſet a whole Cittie
on fire, and all is venome as a Cockatrice.
But the prophet Dauid willeth;

that my glorious Image of diuine
loue,Pſal, 91, 13 ſhould confound and tread vpon
this ougly monſter, ſaying: Super aſpidem
et baſiliſcum ambulabis, et conculcabis
Leonem et draconem. Thou
ſhalt goe vpon this Adder & Cockatrice,
and this Lyon and dragon ſhalt
thou tread vnder thy feete. We read
that Moyſes, Verbis ſuis monstra placauit.
                  Eccl. 45, 2. 
                  With his wordes he pacified the
monſters of Egipt: but this monſter
could neuer be contented and appeaſed.
Example hereof we haue in Pharao,
                  Exo, 7, 13, who after he was infected wyth
thys deuilliſh monſter: no manner of
thing either of loue or frare could pacifie
his minde, or make him contented
with the children of Iſraell. Beware
of this falſe mōſter, & for this intent
I haue thus diſcribed him, that euery
man ſhould be wary of him, and
vtterly deſpiſe him. Notwithſtanding
many times he wyll tranſ-forme him
ſelfe into an Angell of light,1, Cor, 11, 31 by flattering
and diſſimulation, and therof ſpecially
beware: but yet may he be knowen
eaſily, if we wil not giue haſty
credence to him. Thus haue I painted

this ougly fiende in his colloures, that
myne Image might ſéeme the more
goodly: which I pray you to accept,
albeit I moſt vnwoorthy and vnable,
haue taken vpon me to ſhewe forth a
thing of ſo great and mighty conſequence
            
            
               The commendations which Hugo
de ſancto Victore, vſeth of thys
woorthy Image of diuine loue: &
the concluſion.
Chapter. 15.
               
                  YEt ere we parte, it ſhall not bee
much from my purpoſe, to ſhewe
you what eſtimation the holye man
Hygo de ſancto Victore made of thys
glorious Image of diuine loue:
                  Hugo de ſancto victore, hys wordes of loue. 
                  ſayth
he. O charitas, quid dicam de te? quomodo
laudabo te? ſi ſaperemte, appreciarer
te. &c.
                   O Loue, what ſhall I ſaye
of thee, howe ſhall I prayſe thee? if I
felt thee or perceiued thee: I ſhould
ſome what iudge in my minde what
thou art worth. If I knewe thy value,
I coulde eſteeme ſome price of thee.

But perchaunce thou exceedeſt my
poore habilitie, thy price cannot bee
found by mee, it paſſeth my ſmall
power: and yet will I giue all that I
haue, and all that I can gett, for thee,
all the ſubſtaunce of my houſe wyll
I chaunge for thee, all that is in the
poore lodging of my body wil I giue
for thee: and yet when I ſhall gyue
all, I may well repute it as nothing.
All the delectation of my fleſhe, all
the delightes, ioyes and pleaſures of
my hart: I wyll gladly beſtowe, that
I might haue thee onely in my poſſeſſyon.
Thou onely art to mee more
deere, thou onely art to me more profitable,
thou onely art to mee more
ſweete, more pleaſaunt and more delectable,
then any creature beſide in
the whole world: ſatiſfying me moſt
plentiouſlie, ſauing and defending
me moſt ſurely,Whether the hart will chuſe to liue with the world, or with God. and preſeruing mee
moſt proſperouſly, ſo that I will
ſpeake and ſhewe to all men of thy
prayſe. O thou hart of man, which of
theſe wilt thou chuſe: to ioye alway
with this world, or to be alway with
god? The thing that thou loueſt moſt

that doſt thou rather & ſoneſt chuſe,
take good heede therefore thou faint
hart, that either thou redres thy loue,
or els delay thy better electiō. Is there
any thing in the worlde to be loued?
what is there then where the maker
of the world dwelleth? loue therfore
that better place, & thou maiſt make
the better choyſe. Chuſe then looue,
for who ſo hath loue, hath God: he
that hath loue when hee goeth or reſteth

                     〈◊〉
                   whatſoeuer he doth, his hart
goeth not from God. They that haue
charity, in exhorting other to charitie,
they enflame themſelues with
with loue: and they ſhewe not onely
inwardly, but alſo indeede to euery
man, how ſweete the loue of God
is, and howe ſowre and bitter is the
vnpure and deceiuable loue of the
world.The nature and properties of loue. Charity ſcorneth the glory of
this world, it diſdaineth and reprooueth
the toyling and buſineſſe
thereof, and ſheweth what fooliſhnes
it is, to haue confidence and truſt in
theſe thinges that paſſe away ſo lightly:
it meruaileth at the blindnes of
men, that loue ſo much theſe earthly

thinges, and wondereth why they do
not vtterlie condemne and deſpyſe
them. Charity thinketh that thing to
be ſweete to all men, that ſauoureth
well and pleaſant to her ſelfe: & well
may that thing pleaſe them which
ſhe loueth, in that ſhe thinketh nothing
but what ought to be manifeſt
to all. And thus it diſcoureth it ſelf
where it is, for it will not abide ſecretely
within: but wil needs declare
her ſelfe by outwarde conuerſation:
O charity, I haue praiſed thee ſo far
as I can, and ſtill I caſt in my minde, if
there may bee ſayde any more excellent
prayſe to thy laude. I cannot ſay
whether it be more to call thee God,
or to ſaye that thou didſt ouercome
God:Hee Hugo. that is more if anie be more, &
that gladlie and bodily will I ſay of
thee.
               Thus prayſeth Hugo this diuine
Image of loue,The meruailous effects of loue take it therefore, and
ſette it faſt vppon the Altare of your
hart: and alwayes looking vppon it,
conſider the goodnes of it, remember
the vertue & power of it, and ſee the

               It cauſed God to make man, it
drewe him from heauen to earth to
redéeme him againe from ſeruitude
of the deuill. It ioyned the moſt high
and pure nature to the moſt low and
vile nature, wherin it wrought moſte
meruailous thinges, in rayſing deade
men, healing Leapers and al manner
of diſeaſes. And at the laſt it wounded
Chriſt full bitterly, and ſlew him full
pittiouſly, that our dead ſoules might
be quickened to eternall life. It rayſed
him againe gloriouſly for our iuſtification
and redemption. It lifted
him to heauen triumphantly, to glorify
mankind in hys kingdome. It
drewe vp Stephen victoriouſly, and
crowned him with the garlande of euerlaſting
happines. It conuerted
ſuddainly Saint Paule. and fixed him
ſo faſt to his Maſter Chriſt Ieſus:
that neyther tribulation,
                  Rom, 8, 35 
                  anguiſh, perſecution,
hunger, pouerty, nakednes,
ſworde, or any other perrilles▪ could
ſeperate him from the loue of Chriſt.
Yea, and it made Paule ſo ſtrong,
that he ſayd more of himſelfe and hys
followers.
               
                  
That neyther death, neither life,
neither Angelles in heauen,Ro, 8, 38, 39▪
                   nor rule,
neither power, neither good thinges
preſent, neyther any things to come,
neither height nor depth, neither any
creature ſhall be able to ſeperate
vs from the loue of God, which is in
Chriſt Ieſu our Lord.
               And after them, this loue made innumerable
people to reiect and caſt
away all worldly thinges, and to run
after Chriſt, not ſparing nor fearing
fire, ſworde, payne, or any manner of
torments whatſoeuer: but gladlye
tooke them with great ioye and earneſt
deſire, yea, it was but a ſmall
thing to them, to forſake theyr beſt
fréendes for the loue of Chriſte Ieſus.
               And thus not onely in ſtrong
men, but alſo in women and children
weake & fraile, & in young tender virgins,
who were made by this loue
more ſtrong then all the Tyrants: ſo
that they feared neither king nor Emperour,
but ouercame them both in
wyſedome and ſtrength, in enduring

more paines then their tormenters
could put them to, and ſo vtterly
confounded them.
               O immortall and diuine loue, if I
vnworthy and ſinfull wretch, haue
preſumed to prayſe and ſhewe thy glorious
Image thus rudely, ſéeing ſo
many worthy & holye men haue prayſed
and commended thee, yet nothing
ſo much as thou art worthy, as themſelues
witnes: pardon my want, and
enter into my ſoule I beſéeche thee, to
kindle it in loue, to lighten it wt grace
to dilate my hart, to ſtretch out my deſire,
to open the boſome of my minde,
and to eſtabliſh thy dwelling place in
the chamber of my ſoule, that it may
receiue thée O my GOD, Father,
Sonne and holy ghoſt, who art moſte
high and onely loue, into my reaſon,
will and memory, for a continuall
dweller in me for euermore.
Amen.
