man: we committed the debatinge, and diligente examination therof, to certain Byshoppes, and other learned men, whose iudgement we haue in greate estimation.

               I wyll shewe you. When the Lorde God had made the frame of thys world, he hym selfe planted a garden, full of delyte and pleasure, in a certaine place, Eastward, and called it Eden. Wherein besyde other passynge fayre trees, not far frō the myddes of the garden was thear one specially called, the tree of lyfe, and another called y• tre of knowledge of good & euell. Herein the Lord of his singuler loue placed man: and committed

vnto hym the garden to dresse, and looke vnto: geuynge hym libertie to eate of the fruites of all the trees of paradyse, except the fruite of the tree of knowledge of good & euell. The fruite of thys tree if euer he tasted, he shoulde wythout fayle die for it. But Eue, deceyued by the deuell counterfetynge the shape of a serpent, gathered of the forbidden fruite: whych was for the fayrenes to the eye to be desyred: for the sweetenesse in tast to be reached at: and pleasaūt for the knowledge of good & euell▪ and she eate

to goddes purpose, by his spi rite workyng in due season: they throughe grace obey the calling: thei be iustified freli: thei be made sonnes by adoption: thei be made like the image of Gods onlye begotten sonne, Iesu Christe: they walke religiously in good works: and at length, by Goddes mercy, they attain to euerlasting felicity.
               As the Godlye consideratyon of Predestination, and our election in Christ, is full of swete, pleasaunt, and vnspeakeable confort, to godly parsons, and such as fele in them selues the woorkynge of the spirite of Christe, mortifying the workes of the flesh, and theyr earthlye members, and drawyng vp theyr mynde to high, and heauenlye thinges: aswel because it doeth greatly establyshe and confyrme theyr faythe of eternall saluation,

to bee enioyed throughe Christ: as because it doth feruētly kindle their loue towards god: So for curyous, and carnall persones, lacking the spirit of Christ to haue continuallye before theyr eyes the sentence of Goddes predestination, is a most daūgerous downe fall: whereby the Deuyll may thrust them either into despe racion, or into a rechlesnesse of most vncleane liuing, no lesse perilous then desperacyon.
               Furthermore, although the decrees of predestynation are vnknowen vnto vs: yet we must receyue Goddes promyses, in suche wyse as they be generallye settefourthe to vs in holye scrypture: and in our doynges, that wyll of God is to be folowed, whiche we haue expressely declared vnto vs, in the worde of God.
            
            
               
               ¶ We must trust to obteine eternall Saluation, onely by the name of Christ.
               THey also are to be had accur sed, and abhorred, that presume to say, that euery man shalbe saued by the Lawe, or sect whiche he professeth, so that he be diligēt to frame hislife according to that lawe, and the lighte of nature. For holye Scripture dothe set out vnto vs, only the name of Iesu Christe, wherby men muste be saued.
            
            
               ¶ All menne are bounde to kepe the Morall cōmaundemētes of the Law.
               THe law, which was geuē of god by Moses, althoughe it binde not christian men, as concerning the ceremonies, and

Rites of the same: Neyther is it required, that the ciuile Precepts and ordres of it, shoulde of necessity be receiued in anye common we ale: yet no manne (be he neuer so perfecte a christian) is exempte and loose from the Obedience of those commaundementes, which are called Moral. Wherfore they are not to be harke ned vnto, who affirm that holy Scripture is geuen onlye to the weake: and doo

               ¶ Of the Churche.
               THe visible Church of Christe, is a congregatyon of faythefull menne: in the whych the

Pure word of god is preached: and the sacramentes be duelye minystred, accordinge to Christes ordynaunce, in all those thynges that of necessitye are requisite to the same.
               As the church of Ierusalem, of Alexandria, and of Antioch hathe erred: So also the Churche of rome hath erred, not only in their liuing, but also in maters of their faythe.
            
            
               ¶ Of the aucthoritie of the Churche.
               IT is not lawful for the church, to ordeine anye thynge, that is contrarie to Goddes word writtē. Neither may it so expoune one place of scripture, that it be repugnante to an other. Wherefore although the churche be a wytnesse

and a keper of holy wrytte: yet as it ought not to decree any thinge againste the same: so besides the same, ought it not to enforce any thinge to be beleued, for necessity of Saluation.
            
            
               ¶ Of the authority of generall Counsailes.
               GEnerall counsailes maye not bee gathered together, withoute the commaundemente, and wyll of Prynces: and whan they be gathered (for as muche as they bee an assemblie of menne, whereof all be not gouerned with the spirite▪ and word of God) they may erre▪ and sometyme haue erred: not only in worldly matters▪ but also in thynges pertaynynge vnto God. Wherefore thyngs ordeyned by them, as necessarye to Saluation, haue neither strēgth,

nor auctoritye, onlesse it maye be declared, that they be taken oute of holye scrypture.
            
            
               ¶ Of Purgatorye.
               THe Doctryne of Schole aucthoures concerning purgatorye, Pardones, Worshipping and adorocion aswel of Images as of reliques, and also inuocation of Sainctes, is a fond thyng, vainly feigned, and grounded vpon no warraunte of scripture, but rather repugnante to the woorde of God.
            
            
               ¶ No manne may minister in the Congregation, except he be called.
               IT is not lawfull for anye man, to take vppon him the offyce of Publique preachinge, or mynystringe

the Sacramentes▪ in the congregation, before he be lawefullye called, and sente to execute the same. And those we oughte to iudge lawfully called, and sente, whiche be chosen, & called to thys worcke by menne, who haue publique auctoritie geuen vnto them in the congregation, to call, and sende ministers into the Lordes vineyarde.
            
            
               ¶ Men muste speake in the Congregation in such toung, as the people vnderstandeth.
               IT is moste semely, and most agreable to the woorde of God, that in the congregatyon nothynge be openlye readde, or spoken in a tounge vnknowen to y• people. The whiche thynge saynt Paule did forbid, except sōe were present that shuld declare y• same

               OUr Lord Iesus Christ hathe knytte together a companye of newe people, with Sacramentes moste fewe in nombre, moste easye to be kepte, moste excellent in signification: as is baptisme, and the Lords Supper.
               THe Sacramentes were not ordeyned of Christe, to be gased vpō, or to be caried about: but that we shuld rightly vse thē. And in suche onlye, as worthelye receyue y• same, they haue a wholsome effecte, and operacion: and yet not that of the work wrought, as some me speake. Which word, as it is straunge, and vnknowen to holye Scripture: so it engendreth no Godly, but a very supersticious sense. But they that receyue the Sacramentes vnworthelye,

purchace to theym selues Damnacion, as Sayncte Paule sayeth.
               SAcramentes ordeyned by the Worde of God, be not onelye

               The wickednes of the Ministers doeth not take awaye the effectuall operation of gods ordynaunces.

The custom of the church to Christen yong childrē, is to be commended, and in anye wyse to be reteyned in the Church.
            
            
               
               Of the Lordes Supper.
               THe Supper of y• Lord is not onely a signe of the loue that Christians oughte to haue amonge them selues, one to an other: but rather it is a sacrament of oure redempcion, by Christes deathe. Insomuche that, to suche as rightlye, worthelye, and wyth faythe receiue the same, the bread whiche we breake, is a communyon of the bodi of Christ. Like wise the Cuppe of blessinge, is a Communion of the bloude of Christe.
               TRansubstantiatyon, or the chaunge of the substaunce of bread▪ and wine, into the substance of Christes bodye, & bloud, can not be proued by holy wrytte: but is repugnaunte to the plaine wordes of scrypture, & hath geuen occasion to many superstycions.
