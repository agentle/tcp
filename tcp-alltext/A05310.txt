of this boke.
            
               FFyrst ye shall vnderstande
howe the churche of Rome / 
was fyrst infecte with treasure
and possessyons. As fyrst by the
Emperour Constantyne / the great and
his successours? Pepyne / Charlemayn / 
lowys de bonere. And by dyuers other
prynces. Howe be it it was ingendred / &
gadred / vnder the shadowe of polecy,
throughe fayned holynesse. Wherof
sprang great infexions, and therby was
ingend
                  •
               ed many wycked chyldren / as
Pryde, Pompe, Arrogansy, Herisy, Auctoryte
of Kynges, and Prynces, suppressynge
subiectes with great tyranny / wt
               out
mercy, shame or pety, after y• whiche
thynges there folowed great abusyons
and debates, in coūceylles generalles.
And thus of all these foresayd iniquites
engendred great sysmes and diuysions,
seperacyons, & impedymentes, wt percyalytes,
amonge chrysten Regyons wherof

sprange great euylles, trybulacyons
incōuenyences, persecutyons, through
all chrystēdom. And thus through these
enormytes, and Incōuenyences, it was
expedyent for dyuerse Kyngꝭ, & Pryncꝭ
to assemble dyuerse councelles and congregacyons
of wyse & prudent persons,
and faythfull chrysten Rulers, and gouerners,
the which counceles doth more
playnly appere in the fyrst parte of this
present boke and specyally in the .vii.
fyrste sysmes.
         
         
            ¶Of the fyrst sysme & deuysyon / that
began in the churche of Rome, with
persecucyons and deuysyons, that
arose through the possessyons that
constantyne the emperour gaue
to the Bysshop of Rome Syluester
and his successours.
            
               IT is a comune experience / &
dayle sene and harde / that
none euyll is engendred but
through some euyll and malyuolent
persone / as it appered playnly

by one Nouatus an heritike preest & cardynall
of Rome / which was y• fyrst ye inuiolated
ye church of Rome through his
detestable abusiōs & ypocrysy for he pretēded
none other / but to obtayne y• dignyte
of the see of rome vnder his fayned
holynesse / that was throughe Rygore,
and ambysyon. Thus vnder his false &
subtyll pretence was reysed vp two anty
papis agaynst the holy bysshop saynt
Cornelis / the one was y• sayd Noua
                  •
               us

and so was expulsed the said Nouatus,
frome y• knowlege of the churche of Rome
/ & named hym selfe (vnmaculat clene
without spot) and al his diciples and
thus they a bode in theyr appostasy / as
men that denyed the fayth catholyke / &
not worthy to come agayne to the crystē
Relygyon accordyng as Chrystes dycyples
dyd preach and teache the Gospell.
For the whiche errour it was thought
expedyent to assemble a counsell in Rome
of .40. Bysshoppes, In the whiche

coūceyl the sayd Nouatus was cōdempned / which
was the fyrst counceyll that
was assembled in the church of Rome / 
except in the prymatyue churche by the
Appostles, and Discyples, of Chryste.
Thus abode Cornelis a Romayn in y•

vnder the tyraunt Decyus emperour
& he rayned bysshop of Rome .ii.

the church of Rome and so rayned after
Cornelius / Fabyan the fyrst the .xxi. bisshop

of Rome / whiche cristened Phillip
the fyrst Emperour of y• name of ye naciō
of Arabye / who began to raygne Anno
dn̄i .cc.xlvi. which when he dyed gaue al
his treasours, & possessyons, vnto ye sayd
Fabyan bysshop of Rome / the whiche
Emperour dyed vnder Decius the Tyraunt
/ and so bycause that Decius the
tyraunt coude not obtayne Kyng Phyllyppes,
treasours whiche was gyuen to
Fabyan bysshop of Rome. Then Decyus
caused great persecucyon through
all the worlde amonge crysten people,
whiche was ye .vii. persecucion after Nero
the great tiraunt & so in this persecucyon
Fabyan was put to deth by cruell
martyrdome with the fyrst and the .xxi.
martyre bysshop of Rome / folowynge
Saynt Peter / and vnder y• sayd decyus
dyed martyrs, Sebastian, saynt Agatha,
Appolonia with many other ye were
innocent of the treasours that fabyane,
had whiche was y• specyall cause of this
cruell persecucyon of chrystes flocke.
            
               
¶And so this cruell tyranny contynewed
many yeres by detyns and his successours
/ and so after Detyns successid Ualeryan
gallus which began the .viii. persecucion / 
vnder whom dyed Sextus bishop
of rome the fyrst of that name (also)
Laurens his deacon which distrybuted
the goodes of the church to the pore accordyng
to y• law of God also saynt Ypolyt
with dyuers other martyrs dyed vnder
hym. And after hym Aurclianus emperour
borne ī Dalmace, the .xxxii. emperour
founder of Orleaunce in Fraunce.
And y• cytie of Geneue vpon the lake in

on Christes flocke or region through cristendom

            THe .x. persecucion was most cruely
vsed through Dioclesian & Maximyan
Emperours borne in Dalmatiq̄
whiche persecucyon endured .x. yeres,
whiche Dioclesyan caused hym selfe to
be honoured lyke a God in kyssyng his

and crysten rulers to do which was
abhomynable afore God, & man, and
this sayd Dioclesian persecuted ouer al
the Orientall partes of ye world & Maximian
in lykewyse in y• occident partes / 
and tyranny vpon chrystes chosen chyldren

In the whiche counceyll and busynesse

            IOhn̄ the twelfth of y• name bysshop
of Rome / & also borne there, the whiche
afore was called Octauyan thorow
the puyssaunce & tyrannye of his father
Alberyk, he vsed his papalyte very euyl
for he was a man of euyll lyfe, without
chastyte / he companyd wt women openly
without shame / for y• which abhomynacyon
two cardynalles dyscret & wyse
persons complayned vnto Otton emperour
of germany / who rained Anno .962

ye shall vnderstande that the meane season
or Otton the Emperour came / this
foresayde Ingnomynyous Bysshoppe
Iohan, was aduertised of this cōplaynte
by the Cardynalles to the Emperou
                  •
               
of hym and caused thē to be taken, and
of the one he caused to cutte of his nose,
and the other his brestys. And so shortly
after kynge▪ Otton came to Rome and
there helde a counceyll agaynst the sayd
bysshop of Rome. In the whiche counceyll
he was condempned, and deposed
for his wycked and cruell lyfe, yet after
this iust iudgement he was taken agayne
in the acte of adulterye with a mānes
wyfe whose husbande slewe hym with
the dede doynge.
            ¶After the deposytyon of this sayd Iohan
the, xii. kynge Otton caused a bysshop
to be chosen called Leo the eyght.
And shortly after the absence of Otton
the emperour / The wycked Romayns,
sedytions inconstaunt, chased this Leo
bysshop out of Rome, and set vp an antypape,

who was named, Benedictus / 
the .v. for the whiche cause themperoure
Otton shortly after beseged Rome / and
so what for the warre & famyne / the Romayns
were constrayned to yeld and set
the forsayd Leo in his see, and auctorite
and so put to exyle theyr antipape Benedict / 
which fled in to Almayn thus were
these two sismes fynysshed afore wrytē.
         
         
            ¶Of the .xii. sisme abolyshed by
Otton the thyrde Emperour.
            
               BY the auctoryte of y• emperour
Otton y• thirde Anno
dn̄i .993. was created bysshop
of rome / gregorie y• v.
borne in saxonia ī Almayn
and so after the departynge of the emperour
Otton from Rome, a certayne senatoure
ryche & repleat with couetous named
Cressēsius, set vp y• bysshop of pleasaūce
of the nacyon of Grece for money,
and so this Gregorye seyng & dredynge

the fury of the Romayns / and theyr vyolence
 wt all fled into Almayne / towarde
the emperour Ottō / who brought hym
agayne by stronge hande / though this
senatour wt the greke bisshop antypape
with Cressencyus by force and strenght
kept theym within the Castell aungell / 
yet that notwithstandyng they were taken
/ and Cressencyus was byhedyd for
his couetous enterpryse / & the antypape
had both his eyen put out, and wel worthy
for his ambycyous preesthode.
            ¶Thus was the bysshop Gregorye restored
to his dignyte in Rome agayne / 
and he was y• fyrst that decreed & made / 
ordinaūces for y• elexcion of the Empyre
Anno dn̄i .1002. to y• entent y• the elexciō

successour of the said Pascal
the seconde / & another antypape called
Benedictus a spanyard elected by Henry
the fourth bycause of his tytle of elexcyons
inuestures of the spyrytualtye, so
this sayd Gelasius came in to fraunce / 
and dyed at Clugny / & in his place was
chosen bisshop of rome calixtꝰ y• seconde
archbysshop of Uyenne in Dolphyne / &
thus Benedictꝰ afore named antypape,
which held hymselfe stronge in Italy in

the spyte of the sayd Gelasius bysshop /

withstande Gelasius to his power
but shortly in conclusyon he was vaynquyshed

thus fynyshed the .18. sysme.

kynge of naples / whiche withstode hym

on both partyes, but in conclusyon this
sayd bisshop innocēt was vaynquyshed
in batayle raygned▪ & taken prysoner by
Wyllyam duke of Calaber / sone to the
sayd roger kynge of Naples, & yet was
he honestly entreated, & afterwarde delyuered.
¶And so in the meane seasō that
this Innocent the secōde the forsayd bisshop
was prysoner / the romayns chose
another called Peter of Lyon sonne of
a myghty rych cetezyn of Rome / and he
was called Anacletus, for the whiche
elexcyon / Innocent was inforsed to go
into Fraunce for socours / and at Cleremonde
assembled the seconde counceyll / 
and another at Rayns ī Champayne in

from thense he came to Lyege / where as
he foūde y• kynge of romayns Lothayre

hym assystēce with all his power / & thus
what by the helpe of thēperour Lothayr

whiche was Anno dn̄i .113

Innocēt restored to his papacy agayne,
and Anacletus the antipape was deposed,
and spoyled of all his treasure and
reliqus of the Churche to paye the souldiers
withal, wherfore he died for sorow

               ee appostolyke from Auynion vnto rome,

then at y• tyme the cardynallys were
deuyded in two bandys, or partys, & so
the cardynallys of Italy set vp Urban
the .vi. borne in naples / and the French
cardynalles, set vp Robert of Geneua / 
who was called Clement the .vii. and he
kept his see in auignion bycause of this
sysme, thus al cristendome was deuided
in two partys by the wilfulnesse of these
two monstruous Antypapes / beynge
a straūg syght as it were a man to haue
two heddes / and so this sysme infected
the oryent partes of Italy, Almayne,
Hungory, which gaue obedyēce to Urbā
the .vi. on the other part Fraūce, spayne,
Englande, helde with Clement the .vii.

agaynst kynge Charles of Hungry, as
well as for the dyfference that was bytwene

& to thend to gyue clemēt the hole

duke of aungeoy sōne of kynge Iohn̄ y•
was prysoner in England fel sycke and
died within the space of two yeres in the
land of polonya, afore he had fynysshed
his sayd warres, for the which this sayd
french men departed thense into fraūce
agayne, & this forsayd bysshop Urban,
yet coulde not lyue in peace with Charles
kyng of Hungry and of naples, but
was constraynt to flee out of Rome, to
Gennes by see where as in y• passage he
caused to be drowned .v. Cardynallys / 
whiche were great frendes of this sayd
clement in auynyon, & dyd fauoure hym
greatly, & thus this forsayd quene Ione
sold auinion & the coūty of venyse, vnto
Clement the .vii. but some stories wryt y•
they chaūged for y• tribuit, which y• realme
of naples ought to y• church of rome.
            
               
¶For to retorne & wryte yet further of
bysshop Urban the .vi. & of the .xxii. sysme
ye shall vnderstande that this sayde
bysshop as storyes do wryt was / a very

               tions / and debatys
amonge crysten prynces soner & raither
then to set peace, vnite, and concorde, the
which dyscordys and debaytes were not
apeased longe after his death / and thus
longe endured this sysme / and so in his
place was chosen Boniface the .ix, borne
in Naples / y• whiche was not aboue .30.
yeres of

               ege, and this bisshop boniface
was he that vsurped, and toke the auctoryte
from y• Romayns / & so transported
it / & brought it to the set of the bysshops
of Rome / and so fortefyed the castel aungel
agaynst the Romayns / also this boniface
began to rayse y• exactions vpon

                / for al benefycys thorowe
all chrystendome (onely except y• realme
of Englande) and in his tyme was the
gerat Iubelee vnyuersall.
            
               
¶So on the other part after the death
of 
                  •
               lement the .vii. was chosen another
bysshop Antypape at Auynyon / by the
consent of the Cardynallys of Fraunce
called the bysshop of the mone / after named
benedictus the .xiii. against whome
was holden a counceyl in Fraunce as it
is wryten in the seconde part of this / the
which enforsed and enlarged this sysme
the which perceuered and contynued vnto
the counceyl of Constaunce duryng / 
the whiche tyme this sayd benedictus of
the mone supported his obstynat pleasure,
and so cōtynued in his wylfulnesse
vnto the ende of his lyfe.
            ¶Thus whē Boniface the .ix. was deed
in Rome afore wryten / the cardynallys
of Italy chose another bssshop of Rome
called Cosmian of Perouse, who was
named in the see of Rome Innocent the
vii. and after hym succedyd gregory the
xii. a venecian, somtyme called Angelus
be corario / thus worse and worse was

the sisme, for yet al this whyle rayned in
auynyon Benedictus of the mone / whiche
held his ful auctorite as an antipape
vnto whome came as enbassatoure / the
duke of burgonye and of berry and orly
               
                  •
               unce / 
from kynge Charles the .vi. the
which kynge desyred this bysshop of the
mone / to be perswaded from certayne
poyntes / the which he vsurped, and that
he myght be set in his ryght & iust auctorite / 
& also y• the bisshop Gregory the .xii.
his felowe shulde do in lykewyse, vnto
the whiche this bysshop of y• mone wold
make no auswere / but fled secretly into
spayne for fere of losynge of his dignite
and so y• barons retourned with displeasure
without answere / & there this Bysshop
held a counceyl at perpignan / and
there held hym sure in a stronge castell / 
called Paniscolle.
            ¶Thus when the crysten prynces / and
cardynallys sawe that none accorde nor
appoyntement coulde come to passe / bytwene
these two / papystes bysshops of

the see of Rome / but contention & stryfe,
and that none wolde come to the ryght / 
thoughe they had promysed it afore / so
then was there gathered and assembled
another generall counceyll at Pysa in
Italy y• yere of grace of our lorde .1408.
            ¶In the which coūceyl was a syted personally
to appere / both the papystes bisshops
solemply according to theyr estate
yet for all this they lytle regarded this
apperaunce, but held it as a scorne indyrysion
/ the one as wel as y• other / for the
whiche they were both depriued and deposed,
& in theyr places chosen Alexsander
the .vi. borne in the yle of Candye / a
frere minor / the whiche lyued not after
full .v. monethes / and dyed in bollone le grasse / 
and after his tyme gregorye the
xii. whiche held hym in Austrych, yet notwithstandinge
he thought not hymselfe
there not in suretye / but he retourned agayne
