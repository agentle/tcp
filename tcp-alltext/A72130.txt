So perſeuer ſtill I beſeech thee with no leſſe good will to peruſe this true edition for thy ſake and contentatiō only ſet foorth deſcribing the ſtrange, cruell and diabolicall tiranny practiſed through the little regarde and great necligence of Magiſtrates in theſe our dayes winking at ye faultes of the Offenders which neither regarded the pitteful plaints of the tormented, nor the continuall plagues of the Tormentor powred out day by day vpon their honeſt and inocent Neighboures, ſome bereft of life, ſome of their wits and ſome of the naturall courſe of their lims.
            Emongſt which I being one of the leaſt that ſuffered moſte and oftneſt went to ye pot, thought it good to ſet foorth ſome parte bothe of mine owne troubles and of diuers others for thy behoof, in reuoluīg wherof, if irō my hāds thou expect for my philed phraſe or lerned ſtile being but miſled vp in a homely cuntrie Cabbin where the practiſe of the ſtayle and whip more riper

            ¶ The firſt attempt of Elizabeth Stile alias Mother Rockingam and her confederates Witches executed for their offences the twentieſix day of February laſt paſt practiſed againſt the Author.
            
               BEING AT DIuerſe and ſundry times gréeuouſlye vexed, troubled and tormented aſwell in Body as in Minde, ſome times in my raging fits deteſting & abhorring all Company, eftſones again erneſtly deſiring the ſame, I often Imagined with my ſelfe what ſtraunge diſeaſe and gréef it ſhould be that ſo ſhould (béeing whole in Body and not ouercharged with ſickneſſe, although exempt of perfect remembrance) abate my fleſh and weaken my Body, and lying in my bed forworne wt vnquiet reſt, heauy wt ouer much watchīg, & deſirous to vāquiſh my pains by taking a little ſléepe: ſuddainly about twelue a clock in the night a ſhodowe of a huge and mightie black Cat, appéered in my Chamber, which ye more as ſhée approched néer my bed ſide: ſo much the more began my here to ſtand vpright, my hart to faint, and my paines more and more to encreaſe, in ſo much I was conſtrained to call for my Fathers Maid, to vring a Candle, wherby I might more cléerly beholde mine Enemie which did ſo euelly intreat mée, which Maide, béeing entred into my Chamber: I willed to looke for ye Cat, but ſhe was not to be found, neither could the light which ſhée brought continue burning, at which ſtrange ſight beeing amaſed: the Maide beeing gon to bed again,

and I left tumbling and toſſing in my bed, more like to dye then any longer to liue, my ſhéets wringing wet with ſweat cauſed through this ſuddain feare, I called at the laſt to my remembrance a Brother of mine named Iames Galis who about the A
                  •
               e off fiftéene yéeres falling out with one Mother Dutton one of the helliſh broode, and at that time ſuſpected to be in that indéed which afterward ſhée prooued was in like ſorte taken in his bed, and bereft of his wits, which vntil this day are not his owne ſtil crying away with the Witch away with the Witch, I forewith coniectured that the ſame Cat which ſo amazed mée, was either ſome Witch or of ſome Witches ſending and that my paines before and at that inſtaunce ſuſtained was by ſome Witch practiſed vpon mée. Whervpon knowing that prayer in all troubles and extremities was the chéefeſt ſtring wheron each true Chriſtian ought for to ſtrike, I tooke my prayer booke wherin was conteined aſ wel holſome and godly prayers as pſalmes, and with the brackiſh teares diſtilling from the fountaines of my eyes, I ſometimes red therin, and ſometime againe ſinging Pſalmes to the honor and glory of God which had vouchſafed of his meere mercie and goodnes to ſtrenghthen me in this my afflictions, vtterly from the bottome of my hart deteſting and hauing in defiaunce all the crue of deuiliſh Enchaunters, wherof England at this day dooth abounde. Perſwading my ſelf that God béeing my helper, buckler and defence, neither any Witch nor all the Deuils in hel (were they in number as many as the ſands in the Sea could haue once power to hurt mée, all this while not forgetting Iob whoſe faith no plague, no greef paine, nor vexation, that euer Sathan by Gods ſufferaunce might ouer charge him with could not

any wiſe remooue, thus as I haue ſaid, ſpending & contriuing weary and painful night in prayer, Aurora began to ſhewe her ſelf, whoſe criſtall cléernes as it appéered: ſo began my paines to ſurceaſe, & I to be exonerated of the burthen therof, which when I felt: I cauſed forwith the Bible to be brought mée, and incontinently I trurned to the before remembred hiſtory of that iuſt man Job, of whoſe ſtedfaſt faith and milde patience when I had read and read againe, ſuch ſtrength in the Lorde did ſo abound in mée, that after that time all the plagues, miſchiefs and torments practiſed by the ſaid helliſh Hagges againſt mée could not afray mée.
            
               Hovv the Author occaſioned to vvalke to Cluevvorth met vvith Mother Dutton vvhome he (leaſt thinking on) brought to VVindſore before the Magiſtrates vvhich vvithout any examination ſet her at libertie.
               
                  REcouered of my gréefs and by Gods deuine prouidence reſtored by little and little to my former health, bearing yet in minde ſome parte of the ſaid Mother Duttons dealing vſed vpon my ſaid Brother Iames, and after that vpon my ſelf, I determined hap what hap might, when conuenient leyſure might ſerue to bring the ſaid Mother Dutton to Windeſore, before the Magiſtrates there, to the intent if otherwiſe ſhée could not purge herſelf the better of that wherwith ſhe ſhould be charged: ſhée might receiue ſuch condign puniſhment as for ſuch Offēders by the lawes of ye Realme was due and prouided. Which determination as it was then remembred: ſo in proceſſe of time was it forgotten, til it fortuned that walking one day after dinner to walk to Cluewoorth about certain my affaires which I had there to doo: ſhée met mée ful in the face, whoſe ſuddain méeting remoouing my former intent then ſet in obliuiō: cauſed mée furiouſly to lay holde vpon her arme, by the which without many woords giuen I brought her to the hall a priſon in Windeſor deſiring the keeper therof ſurely to kéep her in his cuſtody vntil commaundement were giuen him by the

Magiſtrates to the contrary which hée denyed to doo without ſome ſpeciall warrant from ye Maior or the Iuſtice for his diſcharge, whervpon I led her before Maiſter Richard Readforth at ye time Maior of Windeſor deſiring him as he was true Officer to God and to his Prince to giue his warrant to the Iaylor for the better ſaue keeping of this Witch héer brought by mee before him, who for her deuiliſh Sorceries and enchauntments cruelly practiſed vpon diuers honeſt men deſeruēth not to liue, affirming that if I could not prooue her by ſufficient tryall to be a weed woorthye of plucking vp: I would receiue ſuch puniſhment as might be to all (attempting the like either againſt man or woman) a good enſample but he being belike as a great number be now a dayes ye more pittie, and I would to God it may be amended, miſtruſting her deuiliſh practiſes and fearing leaſt ſome miſchief might ſuccéed his correctiō either to him or his, altogither forgetting his oth and dutie towards God and his Prince, for the due puniſhmēt of Offendors in yt caſe had & prouided commaūded me yt without further delay I ſhould let her go, which foorthwith I did no leſſe bewailing her libertie then lamenting the lack of better Magiſtrates to wéed out ſuch Malefactors.
               
                  
               
            
            
               
               Hovv the ſaid Mother Dutton after her deliuery from the Authors hands by the Mayor, practiſed vvith her Aſſociates his ouerthroovve.
               
                  AFter this peſtilent Witch was ſet at libertie, ſhée with her Confederates perceiuing the little regard the Magiſtrates appointed to miniſter Iuſtice, for the puniſhment of vice had of the complaintes made and put vp againſt thē and greatly encouraged therby, ceaſed not now to practiſe all kinde of meanes to vexe, trouble and moleſt mée which becauſe of my ſtedfaſt faith in God they could not by thē ſelues nor by their wicked ſpirits execute the ſame vpon mée, they ſtirred vp others to be their cruel miniſters in the ſame.
               ¶ Firſt procuring my Fréends whome Nature lincked in the league of looue and Freendſhip vtterly to deteſt mée, ſhamefully to vſe mée, and that which gréeued mée moſte maliciouſly to enuie mee, in ſuch ſorte and ſo long that I often times wiſhed exchaunge of my lyfe for a moſte haſty and ſpéedy death, thus liuing there in exile where reaſon would I ſhould haue béen moſte of all ſuccoured, hated of all without cauſe, and looued of few, it chaunced that a Fréend of mine Maiſter Robert Handley (before reherſed) who at that time for recreation ſake making his aboade at a houſe of his in the cuntrie was likewiſe bewitched in his limmes ſo that he was not able to go, who ſuſpecting his gréefes to come by witchcraft, cauſed mée to be ſent for partely for Fréendſhips ſake which alwayes hath béen equall betwixt vs, and partely to vſe that by my meanes which hée him ſelf by reaſon of his gréefs could not put in practiſe, to whome when I was come after a little talke had, he tolde me that hée douted very much leaſt he was bewitched, wherfore (quoth hée) good R. Galis, if any ſpark of Fréendſhip hath euer béen kindled betwixt vs: I pray: thée to fetch mée a Witch, at whoſe ſight, hope perſwadeth mée I ſhall finde eaſe. At which woordes béeing indéed greatly mooued: inwardly (as one who looued his intire Fréend)

bewailing my Fréends troubles more then my owne, I wēt forth with out any woord ſpeaking, and amongſt the crue of theſe helhounds I gat mée and within one half houre after God being my help: I brought foure before him, whoſe names enſue, videllicet Audrey the Miſtreſſe, Elizabeth Stile allias Mother Rockingham, Mother Dutton and Mother Deuil, all which foure I cauſed to knéele downe before the ſaid Maiſter Handley and one Maiſter Henry Buſt Studient in Phiſick (charging them holding a good cudgel ouer their backs) as euer they would paſſe thence a liue, not only to tel what the ſaid Maiſter Handley ayled: but alſo to eaſe him of his gréef, to whome they replied vſing many excuſes, that they neither could tel him his deſeaſe much leſſe to help him therof.
               Then going about to knowe how they had ſpent their time in the ſeruice of God: I examined them in the Lordes prayer, the beléef and the ten Commaundements, wherin I founde them (to my great gréef) as blinde as a béetle and as wiſe as a Calfe, then demaunding the cauſe of their necligence therin, they replied that ſince they were borne they were neuer taught them, neither could they finde any that would inſtruct them therin, and therfore it was to harde for them vpon ſo ſhort a warning to anſwere vnto my obiections, which replication when I heard, ſorye for their time ſo ill imployed: I drue my purſe and gaue each of them a peny, charging them as they looued their owne ſoules helth: diligently to learn thē leaſt that they come to ſōe ill end, for (ſaid I) it can not other, wiſe be but that for want of thone ye muſt looue the other and for the lack of the grace of God, the looue of his holy woord and commaundements: ye muſt néeds ſerue the Deuil your Lord and Maiſter, and there withall I bad them in God his name to departe, and in ſhort ſpace after my Fréend Maiſter Handley came to his olde courſe I mean to his former health.
            
            
               Hovv the ſame foure VVitches after their departure from Maiſter Handley his houſe vvrought the Authors impriſonment and of his torments ſuffered during the time of his being in holde.
               
                  
                  WHen theſe foure loouing Siſters were departed from my Fréends houſe, being of mée no other wiſe intreated or vſed then you haue heard, miſdéeming (and not without good cauſe) that I would woork their ouerthrow in time if I might be ſuffered, they ſought by priſon to a bridge my dayes, and becauſe they themſelues would be blameleſſe and void of ſuſpition, not contented with my paines paſſed béeing now hated, abhorred and as it were ſpitted at of all men, and eſpecially of my owne Parents & naturall Bretheren and brought euen to ye very brik of deſperation (had not God of his infinit mercy and goodnes with his mightie hand held me vp giuing me a great patience woorthy to ſuffer his croſſe laid vpon me for my offences) they cauſed their Familiars without the which they could not doo any thing, to ſtirre vp and againſt mée to incence the Maior and Burgeſſes of the towne of Windeſor (wherof my father whilſt he liued was a chéef member) who without any offēce committed, any hurt pretended, or complaint made againſt mée, clapped mée vp in Priſon faſt locked in a déep dungion, into the which I was let vp and downe with a rope laden wt as many gyues and manacles as either my legges could cary or my hands be able to beare, there to remain without baile, vntil their further pleaſure were therin had, a crueltie more woorthy for a traytor or a murderer then for any true ſubiect to God & to his Prince. After I was thus incloſed in ye dark, depriued of all humain company, refuſed to haue any bed for my money, or libertie of the Priſon vpon good and ſufficient bond, I then began to miſtruſt my ſelf, and feared the ſudain loſſe of my life, which eaſely then might haue béene depriued and with ſome ſurmiſed tale eaſely aunſwered to the worlde, though not hid from the face of the Lord, neuertheleſſe emboldened by the mightie help of God to caſt away all feare and patiently to ſuffer my troubles: I ceaſed not according to my accuſtomed vſe and to my great comfort and conſolation, to ſing to the honor and prayſe of God the fortie one the fortie two and the thrée and fortie Pſalmes, begining The man is bleſt that carefull is the needy conſider. &c. during thexecution of which crueltie: a pittieful ſound of groning voice opened

the gates of mine eares, and preſently my yrōs which before by workemās cunning were riuetted on, making a wonderfull great noyſe much like to a Smyth working of his mettall, fell of of my legges, & I taken in ſo ſtraunge a cace by the ſpace of two houres, that I thought ye ſoule foorthwith would haue left the chariot of my mortall body. But ſtill perſeuering in my prayers, I ceaſſed not to call vpon the Lorde, not onely for my deliuerance: but alſo that it would pleaſe him to turne the hartes of them which had ſo vniuſtly vſed their correction vpon me. In the morning when it was daye, béeing not called to mine anſwere: I deſired that I might be permitted to haue ſome cōference with Maiſter Doctor Day Deane of the Caſtell royall of Windſore, or with Maiſter Doctor Wicham of the ſame Chappell, prebende men of great wiſedome and learning, to thentēt I might (with their opinions) be fully reſolued of that which gnawed my conſcience, which by no meanes I could obtaine, but within two dayes after called to my anſwere before the Maior and his brethren, and examined of my yrons falling of, I tolde them as before is declared, who hauing nought els to charge me with, gaue order for my deliuerāce, vſing with ſuch extremitie their like power vpon me more then a ſcore of times, which here to expreſſe would be to long, and more tedious to the Reader, ſo that I was forced of my ſelfe to weaue the webbe of mine owne baniſhemēt, rather deſirous to liue amiddes the deſertes of Lybia among the Sauadge and wilde beaſtes then in Windſore with my parentes and kinred.
            
            
               Hovv by the helpe of Syr Henry Neuell Knight, Maiſter Richard VVarde Eſquier, and other Gentlemen of vvorship, the author gat leaue to paſſe the ſeas into Flaunders, vvhere for a time he ſerued vnder Captaine Morgaine.
               
                  FInding here in natiue ſoyle no place of reſt to ſhrowde my carefull head but onely an ougly dungeon without light or comfort, no refuge ſuccour or helpe, but that which ſtraūgers imparted vnto me, I immagined daily with my ſelfe what were beſt for me

to do to auoyde theſe troubles daily more & more encreaſing. Sometimes muſing vpon this, ſometime vpon that, nowe deuiſing one thing, then by and by an other, the lamētable eſtate and ſubuerſion of the lowe countrie in Flaūders, came to my minde, whereof a whyle cōſidering, I determined to addreſſe my ſelfe towardes that coaſt, there to ſpend (if not the remainder of my dayes) yet at the leaſt ſome part of my youthfull yeares in the ſeruice of ſome one Gentleman or other. Nothing doubting, but that God knowing mine innocencie and the righteouſneſſe of my cauſe, would not onely proſper my attempt: but alſo giue me happy ſucceſſe to the ende of my trauayles. Vpon the which point being fully perſwaded, loth without licence. Firſt of my deare father had and obtayned to depart (neuertheleſſe his vnkinde dealinges conſidered) I bended my ſteppes to the worſhipfull Sir Henry Neuell Knight, who with Maiſter Richard Warde Eſquier, by waye of humble petition, I moued to talke with my father about the premiſſes, at whoſe importunate and earneſt perſwaſiōs béeing ouercome, graunted their requeſtes, whereof béeing aduertiſed ioyfull to ſée my deſier take his effect, what haſte I made to ſet all thinges in order for my trauayle, let thē iudge that haue taſted the like diſtreſſe. In fine armed at all aſſaies to counteruayle my iorney before pretended, and ready preſt to ſet forward on my waye, a double ſorrowe began to combate with in mée, and therewithall a doubtfull imagination. The one willing mée to ceaſe trauaile and enioye the preſence of my tender parentes, and louing companions no leſſe carefull of my health then my ſelfe, the other encouraging mée to auoyde the dayly aſſaultes of my aduerſaries by chaunging the ſoyle to ſubmitte my ſelfe into the handes of Lady Fortune. Thus trauerſing in doubtfull doubt, nowe muſing on the one, then thinking on the other, and troubled beyond all meaſure, what were beſt to be doone: I pawſed me a while. At the laſt ouercome with deſier to proceade on my iourney: I determined to put my ſelf to ye mercy of Aeolus puffing blaſts and to the merciles waues of Neptunes ſwelling Seaes.
               The next day bidding my Fréends and Cuntrie farwel, I trauiled toward London, and from thence I ſhipped my ſelfe

into Holland whether béeing ſafely arriued good hay ſo fel out on my ſide that before I had ſpent a day or two in ſéeking beſt for my aduantage, I found vnlooked for of Maiſter William Morgan Gentleman ſuch gentle intertainment that I imployed all my enduour to augment my credit with him, vnder whome I ſpent ſome time on the land, ſome times on the ſeas as occaſion ſerued as the Souldiers life deſireth not reſt in one place, halfe a yéeres ſeruice.
            
            
               Hovv his Captaine leauing the Cuntrie the Author vvas pricked vvith a loouely motion to his natiue Cuntrie to make returne to his Father, vvho vpon his ſubmiſſion receiued him againe.
               
                  THe vprores a little before rife in Holand and in all the Cuntries there about, by valiant proweſſe of martiall Knights ſuppreſſed: my Captain (leauing the Cuntrie) gaue me occaſion to think of my Fréendes in England in the midſt of all mine Enemies not forgotten, which for to ſée an earneſt deſire kindled my breſt, and vanquiſhed with looue and dutie had towards them, I made my return again to Windeſor, more to recōſile my ſelf to my déer father to whōe before my departure I gaue ſome occaſiō of diſpleaſure, then for any affection I bare to the towne, before whoſe Fatherly aſpect, when I was approched, my outwarde teares declaring my inward gréefs: I fel proſtrate on my knées and recogniſing my former follies, I craued meditation of forgiuenes vpon my ſpeedy amendmēt. At the which ſubmiſſion pardoning that which was paſt vpon performāce of my promiſe moſte like a loouing Father receiued me again greatly ioying my ſafe return. Neuertheleſſe deſirous not to remain with him abooue thrée or foure dayes: I departed and made my repaire to London, and in Tower ſtréet became Couenant with Maiſter Stephen Heath a Vintner, til ſuch time as my Father oppreſſed with infinit paines by meanes of this damnable ſect did call me home cruelties and iniuries doon and wrought againſt the braunch could not once ſtanch

their cruell myndes, thirſting after innocent bloud, without the life of my deare father, whoſe bitter paines diminiſhing his wonted ſtrēgth by litle and litle cauſed him to yéeld vnto the mercie of death, to the euerlaſting grief of all that loued him, but eſpecially to mée and other his poore children, left as ſhéepe without a guide to the mercie of the Woulf. Alaſſe what ſhould I ſay? to render vnto him his due prayſe, I want ſufficiencie, and to make long diſcourſe of his milde and méeke pacience, wherein hée continued vnto the laſt houre of his gaſping breath, I can not for teares and grief, wherefore againſt my wil I am cut of from my purpoſe. But thus much you ſhall vnderſtande that no perſwaſions could preuayle with him that hée was bewitched, ſuch was his ſtrong belief in God, and yet diuerſe time ſighingly complaining, would ſaye: O Lord, ſhall a man dye and bée not ſicke? my harte is whole, and yet my inward paines conſume me, and ſo méekely like a Lambe to the glorie of God, taking and ſuffering his troubles, paſſed the ſtraightes of this mortall life, to lodge with Lazarus in Abrahams boſome.
            
            
               Hhvve the Author after his fathers death abiding vvith his mother for her better comfort, framing him ſelfe to liue in the vvorld, vvas preuented by the ſayd vvitches to his vtter vndooing to this daye.
               
                  MY deare father by theſe helhoundes and Impes of the deuell, thus bereft mée, and intiered in the ground (after whom we muſt all hie) I determined to the comfort of my mother, ſorrowing the want of her wedded make, to abyde with her, framing my ſelfe like a ſubiect to liue, and as it became an honeſt man to do, ſo long as the time of his pilgrimage geueth him leaue to abide, I went (with that litle which God and my father had left mée for my better maintenance) to buye ſhéepe and other cattell, whereby by due foreſight and diligent taking héede; I might make retourne of my principall with ſome aduantage, but according to the prouerbe, hée that reckoneth before his hoſt muſt reckon twiſe, and ſo it fell to my lot. For after I had

ſtored my ſelf with the ſaid Cattaill more woorth at the time of their ſale, then the mony I paid for them, they began now one then an other and in fine almoſte all to dye, and the reſt liuing in ſuch a caſe, leſt that I was conſtrained to take half the money they coſt mée gaining by them as Dickins did by his Diſhes who bying fiue for twopence ſolde ſix for a peny, my cattail thus béeing conſumed, and many other attempts enterpriſed by mée, turned topſie turuie, mine olde accuſtomed and raging fits began to ſet foot within my minde I to imagin that Sathans whelps were now ſetting a broch the veſſel of their deſpite to ſéeke my vtter ſpoyle and confuſion. Wherfore I addreſſed my ſelf to the woorſhipfull Sir Henry Neuel Knight, who ſufficently before perſwaded of my troubles, and greatly with my good Lady his bedfellowe, (with whome I had often conference) pitying myne eſtate. I beſought euen in the bowels of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte that either my Aduerſaries who hourely tormented mée might be cut of: or I my ſelf to receiue the like puniſhment if good and ſufficient proof were not on my ſide againſt them.

                  VPon which complaint after Sir Henry Neuel had aduiſed him ſelf, mooued with the pittefull aſpect of my wildiſhe countenance, promiſe was made me that at a prefixed day he only for that purpoſe would come to Windeſore, and vpon due examination had, ſeek redreſſe of my troubles. At which day appointed, I poſted mée to the lodging of the ſaid Sir Henry Neuel béeing in the Caſtel, there to renue the remembraunce of his promiſe, who knowing mine errand vpon my firſt entrance into his Chamber commaundid me foorthwith to bring them before him, at which commaundement, you may thinke I made no delay, but haſted mée about my buſines, & brought

before him as many as I ſuſpected, which were, Audrey the Miſtreſſe, Elizabeth Stile, Mother Dutton and Mother Nelſon, ſaying, Sir I haue executed your commaundement and brought them into your preſence, which if by good and ſufficient tryall, I can not prooue to be Witches: let me receiue the puniſhment due vnto them, at which woordes quoth Sir Henry vnto them, what ſay you to this? Then his Woorſhip further examined them in the preſence of Maiſter Doctor Wickham Maiſter Wullard a Prebend of the Caſtel, Maiſter Morris, and Maiſter Stafferton Gentlemen, how and after what ſorte they liued, whome they ſerued and how they had imployed their time, they aunſwered, as euery one would in his own caſe the beſt, ſaying, yt where they had been ſuſpected to be Witches & woorkers of miſchief againſt their neighbours, it was contrary and that the occaſion put vp againſt them was rather vpon malice then otherwiſe. Then ſaid I vnder your Woorſhips correction, if they be ſuch good liuers as they make them ſelues to be: I beſéech you to examine them in the Articles of the Chriſtian faith, and vpon their aunſwere iudge of the reſt. Then quoth Maiſter Wickham, can you ſay the Lordes prayer which hée hath taught you? No forſooth quoth one, no forſooth quoth an other and likewiſe the reſt, vpon which replycation: Maiſter Wickham began with a moſte godly proteſtatiō to perſwade them not only to forſake their damnable wayes afore & at that time vſed, and diligently to learne the Lordes prayer, the beleef, and the ten Commaundements, but alſo dayly for their better inſtructions to haue recourſe vnto the Temple of God, to heare his deuine ſeruice, and for th'xecution there of (becauſe none durſt wade ſo farre againſt them as I) I was appointed ouerſeer, beeing charged that on the next Sunday following they ſhould be brought to the Church, and publikly in the preſence of all men to be ſet vnder the Pulpit during the time of Seruice.

                  COnceiuīg ſome good hope of future redreſſe vpon thexamination had before the ſaid Gentlemen of woorſhip if otherwiſe they were not conuerted from their follie: I hied me home to my Chamber, where locking the doore to mee I fel flat on the ground rendring thanks vnto all mightie God for that it had pleaſed him of his infinit mercy to open the blinde eyes of the Magiſtrates at the laſt to looke vpon ſuch Offenders which before thorow their necligence, nuſted vp in all kinde of wickednes, ceaſed not day nor night to oppreſſe the Inocent, (my prayer ended) I went about my buſines vntil the day was come wherin I ſhould doo my dutie, at which day I armed my ſelf in the Lord againſt the ſaid Witches, whome gently intreating more to win their harts vnto ye Lord, then for any feare I had of them: I cōducted them to the Church and in the place appointed I ſet them downe, (my ſelf not ſtanding far of thē) where after by the Preacher they had receiued their leſſon, and ſchooled for their lewd behauiour and idle life ſpent to no profit, but to inuent wickednes and miſchief, they departed home. Afterwards whether it were for gréef of the correctiō executed, or the inward gnawing of conſcience, feeling themſelues by the Preacher touched at the quick, (I cannot tel) but with in ſhort ſpace after, Audrey the Miſtreſſe and Mother Nelſon dyed, after whoſe death the ſiſters left behinde giuen ouer to their owne luſts and ſuffered to wallowe in their owne wickednes, made their aſſembly in the pits in Maiſter Dodges backſide, a place where all their miſchief was pretended, and there in generally agréed either to bring me vnto my end, or liuing ſtil to féele a life a hundred times more ſharpe then a preſent death, if otherwiſe the ſooner I ſought not meanes to diſlodge my ſelf, and deſirous not to vſe any delay in furthering their intents, about their accuſtomed

houres of méeting in the night: my bed, ordained for my quiet reſt became the augmentor of my gréefs, and in ſtead of ſléep I was fed with continuall watchings, cauſed through the extreame torturs and gréeuous paines ſuſtained in the night. Thus hauing ouer paſſed many nights in paines, diuerſe and ſundry times the aforeſaid Cat or the deuil him ſelf in a Cats likenes: vſed to frequent and haunt my Chamber hurring and buzing about my bed, vexing and troubling mée beyond all meaſure, in ſuch ſtraunge and lamentable wiſe, that I was enforced with my weapon lying drawen vopon my bed to kéep my ſelf waking in prayers leaſt béeing ouercome with ſléepe: I ſhould be ſtrangled in my bed.

                  COnſumed with theſe infinite paines both in body and purſe eche night aſſayled with a newe grief, lothing anie longer to liue, ſéeing that in foure yéeres paſt, no reformation might bée had for all my complaintes. Leauing my careful bedde, the witnes of my griefe and of my inwarde ſorrowe: I made me ready and girding my Skeane about my middle with a good cudgill in my hande, I gate me to Farneham to the houſe of father Roſeman, whom furiouſly pulling out of his houſe by head and ſhoulders I charged (not vſing any daliaunce with me) to tell me my griefes. Who béeing agaſt at my dealinges, and fearing leaſt that béeing not able to gouerne mée in my fury, I would ſtrike of his head: Said, O maiſter you are bewitched, you are bewitched, wherefore looke to your ſelfe, if not: in fine you wilbe diſtroyed, for you haue many wicked women in Windſore, and ſuch as doe much harme, and who practized the like on mée once, becauſe I did diſpleaſe them. Then I bad him tell mée what they were, who aunſwered, that their names were Elizabeth Stile, Mother Dutton, and Mother Deuell, at which wordes leauing him (not altogether recouered of the feare hee conceiued by mée) I went to the ſayde Elizabeth Stiles houſe, charging her to goe with mée vnto Sir Henry Neuelles, which ſquatting downe vppon her buttockes, ſhée denyed to doo. Then finding a Carte rope harde by, I bounde it about her myddle, and layde the rope on my ſhoulder, wherewith forceably I pulled her out of her houſe, drawing her a long the ſtreate, béeing on the market daye (not one daring once to helpe mee) but a litle boye, which helde the rope by the ende) vntill I came vnto the lodging of Sir Henry Neuell, vnto whome in the preſence of a companie of Gentlemen at that time talking with him, I offered vp my preſent, ſaying, behold

here rigth worſhipfull, I haue brought you héer a monſter, which becauſe of her féebled lymmes, is not able to goe, I haue taken paynes to drawe. Then ſhée began to curſe, banne and ſweare, foming at the mouth like a bore, to the great aſtoniſhement of all the beholders, which amaſed with that horrible ſight (more for feare I thinke then for any good wyll) ſuffered her to eſcape, with the which departure (as I could not chuſe béeing greatly gréeued) ſéeing that for all my complaintes made, no hope of redreſſe was to bée looked for at the Magiſtrates handes: I thought nowe to vſe myne owne force vppon them. Wherefore dayly frequenting my ſelfe to haue once a daye my recourſe by their doores, I would nowe one, then an other, ſo Ribroſt with my cudgell (caried always about mée for the ſame purpoſe) that in the ende getting the vpper hand, I had them in ſuch awe, that the Scholer hauing offended, feared not ſo much his Maiſters correction as they did my preſence, as afterwardes it appeared by Mother Dutton, who ſo ſoone as ſhée had heard of my comming that waye: would haue runne and locked her ſelfe into a Cheſte for feare.

                  MY courage nowe béeing augmented by the triumphant victorie gotten ouer myne enemies, and féeling no more taſte of my paſſed grieffes, my buſineſſe ſo falling foorth, it was my chance one night about xj. of the clocke in the night to ride by the place where theſe Impes acuſtomed vſe was to méete, to my houſe.
               And in my waye as I was ryding, my horſe Léeyng

of a very good ſtomacke, ſudainly ſtopped flinging and laſhing out behinde, ſnorting and taking on out of all meaſure, neyther proceading further nor retorning back, wherewith all béeing litle amaſed becauſe it was no ſtraunge thing vnto mée, I alighted and taking my ſworde drawen in the one hand, and my buckler in the other, caſting myne eye aſide to ſee if I could perceiue anie bodie ſtirring, I ſudainly ſpied a moſt horrible ſight and oughly feende ſitting in a poore mans cart, like one ryding to fetche in his harueſt, with a payre of eies burning like the fiery flames, whoſe ougly ſhape when I behelde, falling on my knées in the middes of the dirt, I beſought God to aſſiſt mée with his ſtrength againſt this feende, and that through his mightie power I might get the victorie. Then riſing, I went towardes the place where this good fellowe was watching for his praye. At whom (my faith ſtedfaſtly ſet in the Lord) I let flye with my ſword, ſaying, auoide Sathan auoyde, and in the name of God I charge thée to auoide, thou haſt nought to do with mee, wherefore go hunte after the Doe which hath cauſed thée here to ſitte. At which wordes: a great light appeared round about the carte where hee ſat, and therewithall an horrible ſent of brymſtone was diſperſed abroade, but hée was no more ſeene afterwarde, with the which ſent Maiſter Afton of the Scalding houſe cō
                  ming that waye the ſelf ſame preſent time, thought preſently to haue died, had not helpe come in the meane time.
               This doone, I gate mée to my horſe, vpon whoſe back whē I was amounted: I paſſed to my houſe as quietly as might be without harme, where not forgetting the goodneſſe of God towardes them that put their truſt in him, I ſpent an howre or two in prayer. The next day béeing come, no leſſe deſirous to be reuenged of theim then they were to moleſt mée before: Hoping ſtill to finde a meanes to cut theim off, and to weede theim cleane from the face of the earth, I practiſed many attemptes, and not ſo many as often executed to the entent I might bée brought to ſome further anſwere, for the extirpating and pulling vp the ſaide wicked wéedes by the rootes. And becauſe there was no Iuſtice that would execute his office therein by the othe derected vnto them. I determined to

prooue what I could doo my ſelfe, wherefore I gat me a pounde of brimſtone, and melted the ſame and dipped therein as it melted a great drie linnen cloth, and into a houile of ſtrawe of mother Duttons, I thruſt it whereunto I put a great fier brande béeing of it ſelfe (the brimſtone taken away) ſufficient inough to haue conſumed a hundreth times as much, which burned vnto aſhes, yt ſtrawe not once periſhed. An other time likewyſe, one Richard Parker ſtanding by, hauing bought a quarter of a pounde of gunne poulder, and as much of brimſtone, I choſe an arrowe from out of a ſheafe, and thereunto I bounde the ſaid poulder and brimſtone with ſtringes, making therein a litle touchhole whereby to giue fier thereunto (whē I thought it good) and thruſt the ſame into an other houile adioyning to her houſe, fully determined to bring her togither with her houſe by fier to playe the laſt act of her tragedy, vnto the which, with a matche ſet at the ende of a long ſticke I gaue fier, which arrowe albeit, it conſumed to aſhes, yet neuertheleſſe ye ſtrawe ſtill remained without any ſigne of hurt which ſtraunge ſight when I behelde, béeing a thing no leſſe ſtraunge to be tolde, then harde to be beleued: I ſighing, ſayde to my ſelfe. O Lord, what ſhall I doo vnto this wicked impe, & to the reſt of her confederates, whom neither fier or ſworde may deuoure, neither Gods thundering threates prouoke to repentance. To ſuffer them longer to experiment life in their wickedneſſe, and to the ouerthrowe of their neighbours, my hart refuſeth. And ſtill to contriue and ſpende my time about it: is to my hinderance. If I complaine mée of their deteſtable dooings: the magiſtrates ſeame deafe, if I (as enemies to God and their Prince) moleſt or vrge them: impriſonment laden with gyues falleth out to my ſhare. If I craue helpe of the inferior ſort (my correction ſo affrayes them) that albeit they would helpe, yet they dare not. Thus doo I ſée al hope of mās helpe taken from mee, and all comfort bereft mée: Wherefore I will henceforth ceaſe and bridle my deſires. And vnto thée O Lorde, which knowing the ſecretes of all mens hartes, canſt and wilt, when thou ſéeſt the time, roote out and pull vp from thy good and choſen plantes ſuch wicked graftes. To thee (I ſaie) will I remitte my cauſe, and ſéeke to lodge and ſettle

my ſelfe in ſome other ſoyle where iuſtice may be miniſtred, vice corrected, & wronges redreſſed. And therewithal departed to my houſe, from whence within fewe daies, after I had ſet my affaires in good order: I departed to ſeeke my aduentures, ſince which time of my departure, it hath pleaſeth God at the laſt to ſtrike theſe wicked and defeſtable liuers with the rod of his correction. Who with the pot of their wickedneſſe ſo long powred the water of God his vengeance vpon them that at the length they were apprehēded and committed to the cō
                  mon gaile there to remaine vntill by due proofe of their diabolicall liuings be tried, & after triall had, receiue the Guerdon anſwerable their demerites, where beeing founde giltie and conuicted of the crime obiected againſt them: they ſuffered at Abingdon the ſixe and twentie daie of February laſt paſt for the ſame, as by the brief and ſumme of their cōfeſſion here enſuing, thou maiſt more at large perceiue.

But ſith to call thinges long time paſt in obliuion to remembrance again, will but increace my gréef and renue my ſorowe: I therfore will with the vale of ſcilence couer that which my hart deſired to expreſſe. Only I beſéech the heauenly Father who is the giuer of all goodnes that this enſample paſt and now to all men moſt apparaunt, may be ſo printed and rooted in the harts of all Magiſtrates appointed for the execution of true and vpright Iuſtice to the maintenaune of the good and pulling down of the wicked, that from hence foorth not only all poore mens cauſes may be pitied, their complaints accepted, and their wrongs redreſſed: but alſo that by their carefull induſtry and diligence employed, all Sorcerers, Witches and Charmerers may vtterly be weeded out from the face of the earth to the commeditie of a common welth and to the honor & glory of God, to whome be all praiſe, laude, dominion and power for euer and euer Amen.
