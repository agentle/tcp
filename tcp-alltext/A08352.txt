Harding &c. Bishoply power in court of conscience to assoile them that shall returne to the bosome of the chirch. To this power bicause many do not gene credit, we pray that it be put in writing in autenticall forme. And also further (being occasioned by necessitie of tyme) we humbly pray that to the same persons be graunted power to dispense in case of irregularitie, except in cases arising of wilfull manslaughter, or brought in courtes of law. Which premisses being redde and vnderstoode, our saide most holy Lord hath decreed that the said persones may in court of conscience assoile Englishmen onely, as it is prayed, euen also from

by the authoritie of the Papaie indulgence, to me committed and graunted do assoile thee from all irregularitie & sentence of excommunication both the greater and the lesser layed vppon thee by law or by man, and also from all thy crimes, transgressions, and sinnes, confessed, contrite, and forgotten, and from all cases reserued to the Apostolike sea. I restore thee to the communion of the faithfull & to the sacramentes of the church, and into the same innocencie and puritie wherein thou wast when thou wert baptised, remitting thee all the paines of purgatory, for the faultes and offenses which thou hast committed agaynst God & thy neighbour. And I do geue and graunt to thee full remission and indulgence of all thy sinnes as farre as the keyes of the Church extend in this behalfe, so that thou shalt be absolued both here and before the iudgement seate of our Lorde Iesus Christ, and shalt haue euerlasting life, and liue in him world without end.

Some purpose it hath had to winne some pelting gaine to the pardoners or proctors that make marchandise of the fayth and allegeance of her maiesties subiectes. But (good reader) the very principall end, & for disclosing wherof it is at this time published, appeareth by the date, by the forme, by the successes that haue happened, by the conuenience of time and matter with the last most tra
                  •…
               
               terous deuises, conferences, conspiracies, knottes, alliances, attemptes, and assemblies, and by other circumstances that fall into vnseparable consideration with it, to haue reached a great deale further, namely to the dissoluing of the fayth, loue, and allegeance of the subiectes of this realme toward the Quéene our most good, louing, and natural soueraigne, to the encombring of their consciences with necessitie of

grudging at her and reuolting from her, and to the assaulting of her maiesties person (whom God long preserue) her royall crowne and dignitie, and particularly and specially to the procuring, raising, aduauncing, and strengthening this late most vile and horrible rebellion, beside the rest that are daily to be looked for with wise, ielous, and circumspect expectation.
            It came sorth long before the Northren rebellion, as well you wote good reason it is that the childe be gotten afore it be borne, or rather that the father be borne before the childe be gotten. It is not vnknowen how for such reconcilementes assemblies haue bene suspiciously made, substitutes haue bene deputed, and the like by many exercised, to crepe into deceaued subiectes hartes and draw them to be wayling of their supposed miseries, and to a desire of returning to the fansiefull superstitions of Rome. How famous is the deliuerie of badges and tokens (with v. woundes and other superstitious deuises) as it were for markes of a faction? How notorious is their byeword of their golden day? It is knowen (for the letters be yet extant in good custodie) how one of

their Northren sacrificers wrote to an other of his owne faction, vz. Sir Iohn Plumtrée, to be satisfied in a matter that troubled his conscience, which was, that he had at one of the rebellious Earles commaundement sayd Masse before absolution obteined from the Pope in such forme as other had it. Appeareth it not euidently that those receauinges to reconcilement are with admonitions or rather conditions not to returne to true Christian religion which they call schisme, nor to quiet and conformable life according to her maiesties proceding, which they terme schismaticall? And what was this els, but to prepare mens hartes by secrete shriftes, whisperinges, exhortations, aduises, and traiterous practises, to repent their obedience, to renounce it, to conceaue a purpose of not returning to it, and so after such a preparatiue of a pardō, indulgence, absolution, or reconcilement, with a glister of treason to purge them cleane of all honest loyaltie, faith, and allegeance. And so the silly abused poore men (be they in worldly respect neuer so riche & politike) are by degrees induced, first to abhorre the course of these times and gouernment,

wherin they are borne in hand that they are out of the Chirch, as it were out of the Arke wrastling for life in the mid maine sea in perill of drowning, and this is their Contrition, which can not be without lothing those whom they thinke authors of their danger, of whom ye Quéenes maiestie is the chiefe. Secondly they are trained to conference and secrete consultation to make shift for their soules by ghostly counsell, and this is their Confession, wherin many traiterous deuises are agréed vpon. Thirdly to make vp perfect penance, for amendes they must enter into actuall rebellion, and that is the naturall Satisfaction to the sea of Rome, wherby the Quéene and realme are encombred.
            But now marke (good readers) now cometh the case that ministreth good cause of consideration to you all. If you (good readers) be of great estate or beare charge in the common weale, as counsellers, lieuetenantes, iustices, or in any degrée of gouernance, now listen to matter of your charge, to awaken your care and put your duties in execution. If ye be meaner subiectes without calling in office, now harken to matter to moue ye to praier to God,

to direct their zeale and trauailes to whom it apperteineth, or rather as he hath hetherto done miraculously to preserue vs. This baggage, and all other of like sort; yea and some farre worse, can not well be sayd by such fine Italian, suttle, and vngracious heades to remaine or be newly put in practise after the rebellion suppressed, in respect of the rebellion past, but in hope of thinges to come. Such thinges as were prouided as appeareth by their date long before the rebellion actually raised, vz. before sommer was xij. monethes, and at this day watch their times, may not be construed to haue regard to time passed remedilesse, but to a reach of mischiefe whose successe is not yet séene. Full true it is that Papistrie hath no looking beyond this world, but is determined within worldly hopes, and therefore their deuises must be thought to tend to worldly politike endes, and so these pardons not propounded for foules health, but for hazarding of body and soule to serue a worldly fetch of treason for aduancing of the Popes and Papictes worldly ambition and gaine. There is a new mischiefe in expectation. God presere our gracious Prince, and her

true Counsellers, which shall be the chiefe defence and safetie of vs all. Note some likeliboodes, but with a ielous regard for so precious a iewell as our Quéene is. Our Louanistes for a good while haue written no more. What is the cause? They take them to other weapons, they hang vpon expectation of the successe of rebellion or some like mischiefe, which by their former bookes they haue trauailed to stirre vp and geue occasion. A number of such as finding them selues to féele some harme or lacke by popishe obstinacie made sutes & gaue some hope a while of toward conformitie, now they shrinke backe, and holde out. And why so: Forsooth the men are now in hope, and in desire to sée the lucke of one chaunce more. It is well knowen that some Papicticall fellowes that of late yeares did communicate and frequent common prayer according to the order of our Church, do of late time, belike since their reconcilement according to this wicked order, absteine from communion and common prayer. And what is the reason? Aliquid monstri alunt, they are put in new courage, and will no more stoupe till they sée more how the

world will wagge, for a thing that they know, as they are borne in hand. What maketh the late flying of Papistes in such heapes, as those that tooke shipping ner

                times, but a trust to returne to pleasant fruition of their desired time vpon the proofe of the mischiefs that they haue brewed, and tonned and lacketh but brochyng. What intention haue they that runne away, leauing letters behinde them to pray fauour of the Quéenes true officers with an intimation or inkling of promise, to be likewise good an other day to those that should shew them fauour now, but vpon a plaine reckoning of some vngraciousnesse in working, to hasten that day of their victorie, triumphe, and abilitie of recompensing? Papistes flie not, stirre not, brag not, nor do any thing, nor leaue any thing vndone without hope. This geare portendeth much.
            But specially wey, why such vngracious geare commeth now out that was prouided long agoe? Why after the rebellion it commeth, that should haue had his place before? Forsooth in the sommer 1569. the rebels were not ready, and therfore

the worst of this sort stayed. In the winter following, the rebels were taken 
                  •…
               ort afore they were ready, and then in an vnseasonable time of winter the publication of those traiterous Bulles would not helpe. Why come they now then? Forsooth vpon their hope of that which ought to be our feare. The world is strange, treasons be venturous, no enemie to be neglected, specially nere and domesticall. There is somwhat in working that ought to moue our ialousie, to awake our hede, to sharpe our foresight and endeuour, and to make vs prouide for preuention, but specially to shield our selues by prayer vnder his wing that is able to defend vs, & in the meane time not to omit those meanes of defence that he putteth in our handes.
            Wherefore let vs all pray for her Maiestie, that with courage she follow God in the course that he hath plainly set before her highnes for her preseruation. All ye noble counsellers goe forward in your honorable seruice to defend that realme that can not in all likelihode ouerliue the safetie of her most royall person. Ye Lieutenantes, Iustice of sheres and other officers looke to your charge, raise vp your attention

                of intelligence or other good meanes may do good, omit them not, for to Christians of all nations the perill is common; and Papistrie is vniuersall and common treason to all kinges & states. All ye in whom it lieth to remedie, let not thinges runne past remedie. Remember noble Scanderbegs prouerb, that no beast be it neuer so fierce, can liue if the head be cut of. Consider that checking without necking is mate.
