            ¶Martyne the bysshop of Dumience,
vnto the moste gloryouse
& peaceable kyng
Myto / kynge of Gallicia
in Spayne
sendeth gretynge▪
            
            
               I Do very well
know (most gentell
kyng) the feruent
thyrste of
your minde, whiche
vnsacyably
gapeth after the
lycure of sapyence / and without
cease coueteth those thynges that
floweth from the ryuers of morall
scyence. And for this cause you haue
monysshed me often tymes, by

your letters, to wryte vnto your
magestye, by the waye of epystle,
some consolation, or exhortation,
or els some other thynge, what so
euer it were / I sholde sende it vnto
you. But all though this laudable
desyer of your deuocion requyreth
this thynge of me: neuertheles
I perceyue it wyll be imputed
vnto me, (of some busye persons)
as a poynt of presumpcion aboue
my knowlege, yf I sholde trouble
your royal dygnite, with assydual
letters, or (as I myght saye) with
vyle letters.
            And therfore, lest I shold other
abuse the lybertye of your godly
motyon, in to moche bablynge, or
els seme to denye your holly desyre,
in holdynge my peace, I haue
sent you this lyttell boke, faythfully
to satysfye your desyrours
ears / not garnysshed with ye shew

of sophystrie nor logyke, but takē
out of the playnest of pure symplycite.
The which boke I haue not
wryten, specyally for your instytution
(in whom is naturally quycknes
of wysdom) but generally for
those that gyueth atendaūce vpon
you / vnto whom it shalbe very, ꝓfytable
to redde, to lerne, & to print
perfectly in theyr memorye. The
tytle therof is: The rule of an honest
lyfe / which▪ I wolde shold be
so called, bycause it doth not intrete
of the hygh and perfecte thynges,
that a fewe contemplatyue &
heuenly persons doth kepe, but rather
it doth teache those thynges,
that may without the knowledge
of diuine scryptures, by the naturall
lawe of mans intellygens, ye
of the lay people & craftes men, so
that they lyue well & honestly, be
playnly vnderstand & kept.
            
               
               ¶The boke.
               AFter the opinions of many
wyse men, there be defyned
iiii. kyndes of vertues, wherwith
a mans mynde ones bewtyfyed,
maye attayne vnto the honestye
of good lyuynge. Of these
iiii. one is called Prudence / an other
Magnanimyte or fortytude / 
the thyrde Contynence or temperaunce / and
the fourth Iustyce or
ryghtwysnes. All the whiche vertues
togyther with theyr offyces,
here vnto them annexed, maketh
a man honest, cyuile, and well manered.
            
            
               ¶Prudence.
               Who so euer therfore yt coueteth
to folowe prudence, let hym
then order his lyfe iustely, accordyng
vnto reason / & ponder &
way all thynges before, and gyue
vnto eche thynge the value and
dygnite / not after the opinions of

many men, but accordynge vnto
theyr qualite and nature. For you
shall vnderstande that there be
some thynges that semeth to be
good, and be not / & there be some
that apereth not to be good, & yet
they be good. What so euer therfore
you possesse of transytorye
thynges, make not to moch vpon
them / ne do not exteme that thyng
to be of great value or pryce, whiche
is casuall & vayne. Nor kepe
not ī hugger mogar your goodes
as though they were other mens,
but bestowe them for your necessyte
as you wolde your owne.
               yf you do enbrace and loue prudence,
you shall be all wayes one
man: & lyke as the cause of thynges,
and varyete of tymes dothe
requyre, so behaue your selfe / do
not chaunge your selfe in any affayers
or busynes / but rather apply

your selfe, lyke your hande,
which is euer one both whan you
sprede it abrode into a palme / and
also whan you gather it togyther
into a fyste. It behoueth a prudēt
man to take councell with aduisement,
and not suyftly (by lyghte
credence) to fall vnto falsehode.
Of dowbtfull thynges gyue no
rasshe iudgement, but deferre the
sentence vntyll you haue forther
knowlege.
               Affyrine nothynge styfely, bycause
all thyng that semeth trewe,
is not trewe in dede: lyke as many
tymes that whiche (at the fyrste
scyte) appereth to be vncredyble,
is not alwayes false, for oftentymes
the trueth bareth the face of a
lye / and falshode lorketh vnder ye
symylytude of trueth. And euen
as a frende somtymes sheweth a
lowerynge countenaunce, & a flaterer

a fayre face, so is falshode colored
with the lykelyhod of trueth
to the entent he maye begyle and
deceyue.
               yf you intende to be prudent,
beholde thynges a farre of, and
consyder in youre mynde, what
thynges maye chaunce hereafter.
Let nothyng be vnto you soden or
vnloked for / but behold all thyng
before hande. For a prudent man
doth not saye: I thoughte these
thynges, wolde not haue come
thus to passe. Bycause, he dothe
not doubte, but seeth furely before,
nor he doth not suspecte and
feare / but doth cyrcumspectly prouyde
and beware.
               yow shall serche out the cause
of euery thynge, and when you
haue founde out the begynnynges.
you shall caste what wyll come
of the endes of the same.
               
                  you shall vnderstande that in
certeyne thynges you ought to
perseuer and contynewe, bycause
you haue begonne, but some thynges
you maye not begyn, wherin
to perseuer is great hurte & daunger.
A prudent man wyll not deceyue
other, nor he hym selfe can
not be deceyued. Let your opynyons
he sure iudgementes. Do not
receyue nor suffer wandrynge cogytacions
and thoughtes, that be
lyke vnto dreames / wherwith yf
you please your mynde, you shall
be heuy and pensyfe, when you haue
ordered all thynges the beste
waye you can: but let your cogytacyōs
be stedfast stable and suer,
whether it doth delyberate & take
aduysement / whether it doth inquyre
& serche / or whether it doth
contemplate and studye, let it not
swerue from the trueth.
               
                  Suffer not your communycacyon
to be ydle, nor in vayne, but
other swade and exhorte, or speke
of dyuine thynges, or comforte other,
or els cōmaunde and teache.
Laude and prayse other moderatly / blame
and rebuke very seldom
For to moch praysynge, is as well
worthy reprofe, as immoderate rebukynge
/ bycause that semeth to
procede of flatery, & this to come
of malyce. Gyue testymony vnto
trueth, and not vnto frendshyp.
Promyse with aduysement, perfourme
it to the vttermoste.
               yf your wytte and mynd be prudent,
ordre well thre tymes. Dyspose
and rule well thynges present / prouyde
wysely for thynges
to come / and remembre those that
be paste. For he that thynketh nothyng
of the tyme past, destroyeth
his lyfe: and who that studyeth

nothynge for the tyme to come, falleth
into all thynge vnwaers. Put
in your mynde the dyspleasures
that be to come, and also the cōmo
dytees, to the entent, you maye suffer
them pacyently & these modetaetly.
Be not contynually tedyously
occupyed, but somtyme quiet,
and refresshe your mynde with
recreacyon / and take hede your recreacyon
be full of the studyes of
wysedome and good cogytacyons
For a prudent man doth not wether
nor waste with ydelnesse. He
hath his mynde somtyme relaxed
to recreacyon, but neuer clene separate
from good occupacyon / he
quyckeneth thynges yt be dull / he
dyspatcheth spedfully those that
be dowtfull / he molyfyeth and
maketh easye thynges that be
harde, and paynfull / and ouercometh
those that be dyffyculte to
attayne vnto. For he knoweth

what he ought to do, and whiche
waye to go to worke / and quyckly
and perfytly seeth all thynges at
ones. Of thynges manyfeste and
knowen, he iudgeth obscure and
hydde / of small he deameth the
greate / of them that be present he
decerneth the absente / and of the
partes he conceyueth all the hole.
               Let not the authoryte of hym
that speaketh moue you / ne who
it is that speaketh do not regarde
but marke well what is sayde / nor
do not studye how you shall pleayse
many / but whom and what they
be take good hede.
               Seke for that, that maye be
founde / studye to lerne that whiche
maye be knowen / and couet
that, that may be laufully desyred
before them that be good. Do not
assocyat your selfe with your better,
in whose company you shall

tremble for feare, & in depertynge
from hym you shall haue a fall.
Then call vnto you holsome councell,
when the prosperyte of this
lyfe fauereth you. Then staye and
stande faste, as you wold in a slyppery
place / and suffer not your inocyons
and passyons to ronne at
large / but loke about you whether
they intende, and how farre they
may lawfully god.
            
            
               ¶Magnanimite.
               FOrsothe yf Magnanimite,
whiche is also called fortytude,
be in your stomacke,
you shall lyue in great suertye, fre
without dyspleasure, vnfearefull,
without daunger, and mery with
a quyet conscyence. It is a
meruelous good thyng of a mans
mynde, not to tremble nor feare,
but to be stedfaste vnto hym selfe,
and to beholde quyetly the ende of

this transytory lyfe.
               yf you be of a valyaū stomack
you shall neuer counte dyspleasur
or damage to be done vnto you,
you shall saye of your enemy: He
hath not hurt me, but he dyd intende
to hurte me. And when you
haue hym in your powre and subieccyon,
you shal counte your selfe
suffycyently reuengyd, to be able
to punysshe hym. For you shall
well knowe, that to forgyue and
perdon, is the moste excellent and
honest kynde of reuengynge.
               Rayle of no man pryuely in corners.
Uudermynge ne dysceyue
no man. Go playnly to worke and
speke boldly to a mans face. For
fraude and dysceyte becommeth a
cowerde. Make no conflycte nor
baytell with any man, except it be
in your owne defence. you shalbe
a bolde and a valiant man, yf you

nother yeberde rasshely vpon daū
                  gers,
as one that were foolehardy
nor yet feare them lyke a dastard / 
For there is nothyng that maketh
a dredfull mynde, but the conscyence
& knowlege of a gyltye lyfe.
            
            
               ¶Contynence.
               YF you loue cōtynence, cut away
all superfluyte. Kepe togyther
your desyres in a narow strayt.
Consyder wt your selfe how moch
nature doth requyre of dewtye, &
not how moch she coueteth vnlawfully.
yf you be cōtynent you shall
come to this poynt, that you shall
be content & suffycyent with your
owne selfe. And he that is vnto
hym selfe satysfyed & suffycyent,
is borne with ryches abundaunt.
Put vnto concupycence a brydle.
Cast away all those thynges that
doth flater and please which intyseth
and draweth the mynde with

preue voluptie & delectatiō. Eate
without crapulosyte, and surfet
not. Quench your thurst, & quaffe
not, and beware of dronkenesse.
Take hede you do not in festes &
other copanyes reproue & dampne
such ꝑsons, whose maners you do
not alowe. Ne delyte not to moch
in such delicious pleasurs, as you
haue present / nor yet couet those
that you haue not. Se that your
fare be of an easy coste, and come
not vnto voluptuouse pleasures,
but vnto meat. Let hūger styre vp
your appetit, & not dainty dysshes
Refreshe your desyres with a lytle
bicause you ought only to care for
this thyng, yt is, to labour yt they
maye sease. And thus lyke as you
be made after ye diuyne & godly symylitude,
so endeuer your selfe as
moch as you maye, to forsake the
fleshe, & cleue vnto the spyryte.
               
                  yf you studie to haue cōtynence
dwell not wantonly, in places all
of pleasure, but in good ayre helthfully,
nor do not couet to be knowen
as a lord by your house, but let
your house be knowen by ye mayster.
Do not fayne to be, that you
be not, nor yet to appere to be better
then you be. Take good heed
of this thynge, that pouertye be
not vnto you fowle, that is to saye
do not dyspyse it as a thynge vyle
& lowthsome, nor frugalyte fylthy
nor symplycyte neglecte, nor yet
playnes paynfull or greuouse.
               And yf your goodes be small, neuertheles
let them not be nygardely
vsed, nor do not dysperaetly dysprayse
your owne, nor wt grudge
prayse other mens. yf you loue
contynence, fle all fylthy thynges
before they come vnto you, feare
no mā more then you do your own

selfe, byleue that all thynges be
more tolerable then fylthynes. Abstayne
also from foule & fylthy cō
                  municacyō,
for ye sufferaūce therof
increaseth & nouryssheth vnclenlynes
& vnchaste bowldenes. Loue
better fruetful cōmunicaciō, than
those that be eloquent, those that
be trew, rather then such as be flaterynge
& fayre. Myxte somtyme
myrth with maters of grauite, but
yet temperate them & set them in
theyr place, without the detrymēt
of chastite & sadnes, for laughyng
is reprochefull: yf it be immoderate
/ yf it be wanton & chyldyshe,
or yf it be nyce & folyshe. Laughynge
also (yf it be superstycyously
prowde, yf it be lowde and shryll,
yf it be dysdaynyng & malycyouse
yf it be preuy & wysperynge, or yf
it ryse of other mens hurte & dyspleasure)
maketh a man haetful.

yf therfore ye time requireth myrth
& sporte, take hede you vse them
also with grauite and wysdome,
that no man fynde faute with you
to be roughe and curyshe, nor yet
to dyspyce you as though you
were worthy to be caste out of cō
                  pany.
Use no rude carterly fashyon,
but gentell cyuyle maner.
Use myrthe without checkynge / 
sporte and pastyme without lyghtnesse
/ spekynge without lowde
voyce / goenge without lowde
noyse and trampelynge / and reste
without slouth and slogeshnes.
               And when that other spende the
tyme folyshly / occupye your selfe
about some honest thynge vertuously.
yf you be contynent,
shonne flaterers, and be as loothe
to be praysed of naughtye fylthy
persons, as you wold to be laudyd
for filthy dedes. Reioyce & be glad

so often as you dysplease those yt
be naught, & counte the naughty
estymacyons of yll persons to be
very laude and prayse vnto you.
It is the most hardest thyng that
belongeth vnto contynence, to auoyde
the pleasable and glosynge
speche of flaterers: whose cōmunicocyon
melteth a mans mynde
with a certayne delectation. Gette
no mans amyte or frendshyppe by
flateryng, nor suffer no man to get
yours by such wayes. Be not malaparte
boulde, nor yet presumptuouse
prowde. Humilyate your
selfe and do not dysdayne / but
kepe grauyte and sadnes.
               Take monycyons gentely, and
pacyently reproches. yf any man
doth chyde you worthely, counte
that he profyteth you / yf he blame
you vnworthely, you shall know
that he entendyd verely to profyte

you. Feare not sharpe and bytter
wordes, but beware fayre & flateryng
speche. Fle your owne vyces
& fautes, and be not to curyouse a
sercher of other mens, nor yet a
bytter and greuouse rebuker, but
(without tawnte & checke) a corrector
/ so that you myxte your monycyons
with hillaryte & gentelnes,
and gyue ꝑdon vnto hym yt erreth
Do not extoll any man to hygh / 
ne dysprayse no man to lowe. Be
a styll hearer of them that speketh
vnto you, and a prompt & dylygēt
teacher of them yt wyll heare you.
Answer gently vnto hym that speketh
vnto you, & vnto hym that cō
                  tempneth
departe quyckly, and do
not go awaye checkynge & brawlynge,
nor yet cursynge. yf you
be contynent, take hede of the mocyons
and dysposycyons, bothe of
your mynde & also of your body,

that they be not vncomly nor out
of fassyon / & do not lytell regarde
them, bycause they be preuy and secrete
/ for it shall not skyll though
no man seeth them / it is suffyciēt
when you know them your selfe.
Be mouable and flexible, but not
lyght & waueryng / constant & sted
fast, but not selfe wylled nor obstynate.
Remēber, & let it not be greuouse
vnto you, to haue the knowlege
of some thynge. you shall
counte euery man to be equall wt
you. yf you contempne not your
inferyores by pryde, you shall (in
lyuyng well) be out of the feare of
your superyores. In requytynge
beneuolence, be not neglygente,
nor do not apere to be folyshe dylygent.
Be gentell vnto euery man,
& a flaterer vnto none / famylier
vnto a few, and iust & trewe vnto
all. Be more cyrcūspect ī your iudgement

than in your cōmunicaciō
more strayter in your lyuyng, then
in your outward countenance. Be
a mercyfull punyssher, & abhorrer
of crudelyte. Be nother a spreder
of your owne good fame, nor yet
an haeter of other. Gyue no lyght
credence vnto rumors, cryems, &
suspycyons / but rather be moost
agaynst such malicyouse persons
that crepeth vnder ye cloke of symplycyte
to hurte other. Be slow vnto
yre, & vnto mercy be prompte &
redye. Be stronge and stedfaste in
aduersite, & in prosperyte be cyrcū
                  specte
and ware. Be an hyder of
your own vertues, lyke as other
be of theyr vyces. Be a dyspiser of
vayne glorye, and not an egar requyrer
of the houour, whiche god
hath indued yow withall. Laugh
not to scorne the vnwysnes, and
ygnoraunce of other. Be of fewe
wordes, but a pacyent hearer of

them that speketh. Be dyscret and
sad, but dyspyse not them that be
merye. Be desyrous of wysdome
& redy to lerne / and those thynges
that you know teache with all dylygence
& gentelnes, & those yt you
know not, desyer to be taught, wt
                  out
any shamfastnes or hydynge
of your ygnoraunce.
            
            
               ¶Iustice.
               WHat is the fourth vertue Iustyce?
but a cōuencyō & cōuenaunt
of nature? inuented to
the helpe & cōfort of many. & what
is iustyce? forsoth not our institucyō
nor ordynaūce, but a dyuyne
lawe & bond of mans socyete. In
this we may not way and ponder
what shalbe expediēt & necessary, yt
is expediēt & necessary what someuer
iustyce sheweth vnto vs. who
soeuer therfor you be yt desyreth to
folow this iustyce. Fyrst drede & loue
god, yt you may be loued of god

Trewly you shal loue god, yf you
wyl imytate hym ī this / yt is to say
Be wyllyng to profyte all men, &
to hurte none. And then euery mā
wyll call you a iust & a ryghtwyse
man, euery man wyll laude you,
euery man wyll worshyp you / and
euery man wyll loue you. To the
entent you maye be iust, you shall
not onely do no hurt, but you shal
also wtstand naughty doers. For,
to do no hurt, is not iustice, but to
abstayne from yll is iustyce. Therfore
begyn at these, yt you take not
awaye other mens goodes / & endeuer
your self to cōme vnto hygher
ꝑfection / yt you may also helpe to
restore thynges taken awaye / and
castygate, punyshe & holde strayt
robbers and spoylers of other.
               Implycate no cōtrouersy of yt ambyguite
& dowtfulnes of spekyng
but behold the qualytie & menyng

of the mynde. It shall not skyll
whether you affyrme or sweare,
when so euer you intreate of the
truth, you shal wel know yt you intreate
both of fayth & religyō. For
yf in swerynge, god sholde not be
called to wytnesse, & yet vnto hym
that sweareth not by hym, he is
wytnesse. Do not than ouerslyppe
the trueth, leste you ouerpasse the
boundes & law of iustyce. And yf
you be cōstrayned at any tyme to
vse a fayned word / vse it not for ye
clokyng of falshode, but for the custodie
& kepynge of trueth. And yf
you chaunce to be cōpelled to saue
your fydelyte or honeste wt a fayned
word / do not make a lye / but
rather excuse your selfe: bycause
where as the mater is honest, the
ryghtwyse dylcloseth not secretes
nor coūcelles, but kepeth thynges
that sholde be close, and speaketh

those thynges that may be laufully
spoken. And thus he is in peace
quyet, & sure tranquylyte / & whyles
other be ouercome with theyr
yll doenges, he vāquessheth those
yt be yll. yf therfore you endeuer to
studye these thynges gladly and
wtout drede, loking for the ende of
your pylgremage. you shal merely
with a quyet conscyence, beholde
the calamyte and heuenes of this
wretched world, & quyetly the dysquyetnes
& trouble, & sauely the
wyckednes & daungers of ye same
               These. iiii. kyndes of vertues
with these instytucyons & offyces
vnto them belongyng, wyll make
you a perfyt man. yf you kepe the
mesure & straytnes of them with a
iuste intent of good lyuynge.

of fautes, you shalbe counted
to be a watcher of other men, a suspycyouse
& a busy ꝑson euer fearyng,
cōtynually sekīg, & alwayes
faynyng some thynge. And one yt
occupyeth suttle suspicyons to the
reproch of ye cryme & faute of some
other: you shalbe poynted wt the
fyngar, yt is to say, you shalbe surely
noted, to be one full of sutteltye,
a dowble felow, an enemye to
symplycyte & playnnes, an inuentor
of fautes. And in cōclusyō you
shalbe called (wt one voyce) of euery
man a naughty body. Prudēce
therfore beyng not measured with
reason, bryngeth a man into these
dyshonestes, & shames. But who
so euer ledeth his lyfe in ye euen &
equale balaunce therof hath nothyng
ī hym suspicious nor crafty

¶Also yf Magnanimytye stretceth
beyonde his due measure, he
maketh a mā a thretenar, a proude
facer & craker, trobulous and dysquyet,
hasty to auaunce hym selfe
to excell in all thynges that ben
spoken of, honesty set clene aperte
which at euery mynute styreth vp
his browes, lyke as a beest or wyld
boore setteth vp his brystels, and
suffereth nothynge to be quyete / 
he stryketh one man, he dryueth &
chaseth awaye an other. But all
though he be a bolde and valyant
chāpyon, yet for all yt he can not
suffer thynges aboue his strength
but at last, other dyeth a wretched
deth, or elles leueth a lamentable
ende and memorye. The measure
therfore of magnanymite, maketh
a man nother fearefull nor folehardye.
               ¶Furthermore let cōtinēce kepe

you within these lymites. Beware
you be not a nygarde, ne scrapse
nor kepe your goodꝭ suspyciously
& fearefully, as though you shold
neuer haue ynough, nor set not to
moche by tryfulles of no value,
but kepe contynence by the rule of
medyocryte or meanes, yt you be
not gyuē to voluptuosite nor seme
to be prodygal or vyciouse, nor yet
thorough couetouse catchynge to
be vyle and fylthye.
               ¶Fynally iustyce must be orderyd
by the way of mediocryte leste

nother for great fautes nor
for smale, but do permytte the libertye
of naughty doynge, other
to suche as flater & pleyse you, or
els vnto them yt prowdly contempneth

you. And agayne to be to rygorouse
& strayte, shewenge no fauour
nor gentelnes, you shall apere
vnto men to be sharp & cruel.
Therfore the rule of iustice ought
to be so louyngly kept, yt the reuerence
therof wexeth not vyle by to
moch sufferaunce of neglygence,
nor yet (thorough to cruell straytnes)
lese ye grace of humanyte.
               ¶yf any man therfore desyreth to
ordre his lyfe (wtout faute) not onely
for his owne vtylite & profyte,
but to the profyte of many other / 
let hym kepe (by the same path of
mediocryte) this rule of the aforesayde
vertues accordyng to ye qualyties
of places, tymes, ꝑsons, &

            ¶The encherydion

               ¶The defynition of encherydyon.
               ENcherydion (after the mynd
of Angell Polytian) signyfieth
bothe a manuell or hand
boke / & also a sowldyars dagger.
We se by experyence that a dagger
is so proper and handsome
a weapen, that euery man, ye (almoost)
euery boye, hath one hangyng

by his syde. But verely this
word encheridyon, when it signifyeth
a small hand booke, is moch
more handsome and necessary, not
to hange at a mans gyrdell, but
for euery man and chylde to haue
in his hande. And therfore it is called
encheridiō, in englysh, an hand
booke, not only bycause it is small
and portatyue, but bycause it is
(for the fruyte and vtylite therin)
worthy and necessary to be had in
in euery mans hande. When so euer
therfore hereafter you redde
this tytle vpon any boke, thyncke
surely that there is a booke handsome
and mete for you. And so let
this word encherydion from hensforth
be as comune (for the sygnyfycacyon
afore sayde) in our englysshe
tonge, as it is in greke or
latyne, bycause we can not fynde

in our mother tonge any one word
(without cyrcumlocucyon) to sygnyfye
the very etymologye and
proper strength therof.
            
            
               ¶Of the strayt and chaste
intent.
               
                  THe fyrst & cheyf
impediment, yt
hindereth those
that wolde profyte
& go forth
in the waye of
god, is the loue
of hym selfe,
wherof spryngeth all other vyces
For of this it cometh to passe, that
men thorough the impuryte and
imperfeccyon of theyr intent, do in
all thynges more seke for theyr
owne selues (that is to saye, theyr
owne profyte, theyr owne laude,

and that they moost desyre, theyr
owne beatytude) rather then the
honour and glorye of god, & that
not onely in theyr workes, but also
in theyr vertues and gyftes of
god, ye in theyr sekyng of ye kyngdome
of heuens. And therfore it
is no meruayle though they fall
many tymes into dyuers errours
and synnes. But you (syns all our
workes getteth fruyt and meryte
accordynge to the intent they be
done fore, yf you desyre to be saued
and profet) shall fyrste call for
the helpe of god, without the whiche
you can nothynge preuayle.
And merke well all your wordes,
all your actes, and all your desyers,
and in euery one of them seke
out your intent, that you may inquyre
nothyng else but purely the
honour and pleasure of god / your
owne selfe and all other thynges

set aperte now and euer. Nor you
shall say nothyng, nor do nothyng
but that wherin you truste verely
to pleyse god.
            
            
               ¶The wanderynge of the
harte thorough the loue
of creatours.
               THe seconde impedyment, is,
an inordynate and vndyscret
loue vpon creatours. This
loue quyckly dysquyeteth a mans
harte of euery lyght occasyon, so
that the interyor eye beyng vexed
with loue, hactered, ioye, sorowetrouble,
or vnlustynesse, can nother
knowe god nor hym selfe, nor
yet what is ryght and iuste.
               Wherfore, yf yow loue the peace
of the herte, it is necessary to kepe

it clene and fre, frome the loue
of creaturs, and referre all thynges
(how so euer they chaunce vnto
you) vnto ye dyuyne prouydence
of god, cōmyttynge vnto hym all
your cares, all your cogytacyons
takynge good hede that nothynge
resteth in you, nothynge entreth
your mynde, but god. Gyue the
erth for heuen / gyue the world for
god. All thynges are vyle, that be
in the worlde, and not worthy to
be set by, nor loued / let it alone for
them that be of the worlde, for the
whiche our sauyour Chryste dyde
not vouthsaue to praye. you can
not serue and please two lordes,
nor loue thynges dyuerse and cō
                  trary.
yf you wyll know, what you
loue, take good hede what you
thynke mooste often vppon. For
where as is youre treasure, euen
there is your harte.
            
            
               
               ¶The mortyfycacyon of
the senses, or sensualytye.
               THe thyrde is the mortyfycacyon
of sensualyte: For,
men beynge prone vnto vyce
do ouerthrowe and gyue them self
to moche to the intycementes and
vayne delectacyons of the senses,
and vnto the solace and comforte
of nature more than nede or reasonable
dyscrecyon, as, in meat and
dryncke, in cōmunycacyon, in companye,
in goodes, in occupacyons
and in other lyke thynges, bothe
vayne and curyouse, wherby they
lese and let the inwarde peace, the
sensyble deuocyon, and the grace
of god, sowyng in the flesshe wherof
they shall reype corrupcyon.
               But be you contynent and chaste
of your senses, fyghtynge manful

agaynst your vnlaufull desyers,
and concupycences, fleynge all the
occasyons and intysementes vnto
the same, and constraynynge your
selfe, by vyolense, vnto vertues,
contrary vnto them, vntyll you be
mortyfyed from vyces and passyons,
that the same sensualyte may
obey vnto the spyryte. ¶Further
of this mater, you shall haue in a
trearyse of the fyue senses taken
out of the euangelycall worke of
Marchus Marulus.
            
            
               ¶Of humilyte.
               THe fourth is pryde, vayne
glory, his owne conceyte or
pleasure in extemynge hym
selfe, and the desyre and ioye of
prayse, wherby many do rest in the

fauour, laude, and estymacyon of
men. For these vyces dyuerse are
forsaken of almyghty god, bycause
when they iudge them selfes to
be hole, they nother seke nor receyue
medycynes and remedyes.
In so myche therfore as very humylite
is chyefly necessary for you
(which is the onely & moost surest
waye vnto god, wherof springeth
all goodnes) labour than so vehemently
to optayne it, yt you stycke
not to praye vnto almyghty god
without cease for it, extemynge
youre selfe (as yet) to be mooste
proudeste and moost vyleste.
               More ouer you shall contynually
haue before youre eyes, the
infynyte mayestye, the infynyte
wysedom, & the infynyte goodnes
of god, and on tother syde the depe
vylyte of your own vnworthynes

iudgynge your selfe vnfaynedly
to be the moste wretched synner in
the worlde, for the multytude of
your vylenes and ingratitude, vnworthy
all the benefytes whiche
you haue or shall receyue, other
of god or his creaturs, & fynally
to be worthy all paynes & dyspleasurs. And thus you shall submyt
your selfe vnto all men, and chosynge
to your selfe, euery where,
the lowest place, cryeng vnto god
as a wretche, Deus propitius esto
mihi peccatori, O god be mercyfull
vnto me a wretched sinner, couetynge
to be contempned & trode
vnder fote of all men. This humilyte
getteth fauour of god. & maketh
you parttaker of all his graces
and benefytes. Oh who can
clayme vnto hym holynes? when
it is so harde, so vncertayne, and
so dyffyculte, to renounce and forsake

sensualyte and proper wyll.
How be it there is oftentymes, by
onely nature a dysposycyon there
vnto, wherof is ingendred a false
opynion of great sanctyte and holynes.
            
            
               ¶Of charyte.
               THe fyfte is a bytternes of
the herte, wherby many be
prone and redy to impacyence, to
haetred, to reuengynge, and to despysynge
of other. These do murmur
agaynst theyr superious and
rulers / these do iudge & contempne
theyr neyghbours / these do speke
yll by, rayle and detracte theyr
brotherne, and beholdyng al thynges
with a venemouse eye (wherwith
they be infecte) do interprete
to the worste, haetfull both to god
and men. Wherfore yf you wyll
at any tyme profyte, it is necessary
that you loue euery man in god,

and in euery man reuerence and
honour the ymage of god, and suffer
no bytternesse nor dyspleasure
to reste in youre mynde agaynste
any man, but mete euery mā with
a louely countenaunce, in the swetnesse
of charyte, in the mansuetude
and myldnes of harte, and in
the gentelnesse of speche, redy to
bare ye burthens and infyrmytyes
of all other, dylygent to helpe the
indygence and nedynes of other,
prone to forgyne the trespace of
other, and to interprete all thynge
to the beste, to iudge nor dysplease
no man, to profyte and to helpe al,
and generally (without any excepcion
of persons) to bestowe vpon
euery man pytye and mercy.
            
            
               ¶The renounsynge and
denyenge of proper
wyll.
               
                  THe syxte is the propryetye
of wyll, wytte, & counsell,
whervnto many do so moch truste
that they durste not commytte ne
resyne them selues nother to god
nor men, but they haue the same
propryete bothe in iudgynge and
chosynge, as an vnderpynnynge
and fundacyon, where vpon they
buylde all that they do. The whiche
thynges, all though they some
great and excellent, neuerthelesse
they styncke before the eyes of
god. Therfore yf you wyll ouerthrowe
this fundycyon, there shal
fall in you therwith all the walles
of Hierycho, that is to saye,
all the impedymentes and defautes.
Wherfore it is very necessary
that you laye an other fundacyon,
that is too saye, a full
and perfyte abnegacyon and renounsynge
of youre owne selfe,

by the whiche you shall forsake &
leue your owne selfe, and without
any let or retraccyon of the herte,
cōmytte your selfe vnto the pleasure
of god imbrasyng hertely his
wyll with an inwarde delectacyon
& obey vnto men for goddes sake
in all laufull thynges, most surely
trustynge vnto his goodnes,
whiche vnto them (yt gyueth them
selfes vnto hym both in herte and
dede) is euery where present, and
prouydeth for them (by his ineffable
prouydence) bothe in prosperyte,
and aduersyte / and also in smal
thinges more better than they can
desyre. What so euer thyngꝭ therfore
chaunseth vnto you, receyue
them, not as of man or other creature,
but immedyatly of god, as
though it were from the hande of
his dyuine prouydence, and that
with an equall mynde and quyet

eleuate aboue the chaūces of transytory
thynges, and fyxed by loue
in god, no more desyrynge prosperyte
then aduersyte, vntyll all propryete
of your wyll and iudgemēt
be vtterly in you extynguysshed
and dede.
            
            
               ¶The immitacyon
of Chryste.
               THe seuenth is an immoderate
studye, wherin the vnderstandynge
is occupyed about
bare speculations, and there as is
nother deuocyon, nor heat of affeccyō
toward god sought for, but
redynge, whiche is vsed other for

or els onely for knowlege. They
that be suche persons, are vayne,
pufte vp with pryde in theyr owne
conceyt, presumptuouse, and very
barreyn in effecte, the whiche verely
can speke of the spyryte, but

they neuer deseruyd to taste therof.
But you shall not redde therfore
to be counted lerned, bnt to
thentent you maye be deuoute.
               Euer iudge your selfe to knowe
nothyng, nor desyre to know none
other thynge, but Iesus Chryste,
beynge for you crucyfyed / yf you
knowe Iesus Chryste well, it is
suffycyent though you knowe not
other thynges, in his lyfe & in his
passyon, occupye your selfe contynually,
in contemplatyng what he
sufferyd for you, that you may suffer
with hym, how, that you may
studye to imytate the same (that is
to saye) his maners and vertues,
Wherfore, that you maye in louynge
hym agayne requyte his
charyte. Let this desyre encrease
in you euermore, that you may (so
moch as is possyble) be conformed

               ¶Of the puryte and eleuacyon
of the mynde

               THe eyght is the negligence
and forgetfulnes of the inward
man, the vnstabylyte of the
herte, and to moche sufferaunce of
wanderyng of the mynde, wherof
it cometh to passe, that the herte
beynge paynted with dyuers imagyes
and fygurs, taketh no hede
of the dyuyne inspyracyons, nor
can not lyfte vp it selfe vnto god.
But you (all the occasyons of vnquyetnes
set aperte) shall seclude
(so moch as is possyble) the imagynacyons,
formes, and symylytudes
of thynges, and also the memoryes
of wordes and dedes. And
then (the poures of your soule beynge

gathered togyther) you shall
rest with thyn your selfe, in the sylence

affeccyon fre from all creatures,
yt memorye also eleuate vnto god)
intende fynally euery thynge that
you do, vpon hym, and euer cleue
and stycke vnto hym. For why do
you labour about many thynges?
Thynke vpon one, desyre one, and
you shall fynde reste. Alwayes
therfore where so euer you be, let
this voyce sounde in your eare.
My sonne turne vnto the herte,
refraynynge your selfe frome all
other thynges, that you may stedfastly,
with a clere & symple herte,
perceuer in god, thynkynge vpon
nothynge but hym, desyrynge nothynge

               ¶An exercyse of the dyuyne
loue.
               THe nyenth is, vnlustynesse
or dulnesse, wherby many
beynge led by the onely custome
and vse, do good dedes, extemyng
perfectyō in the multytude of workes,

this rule as a profytable compendyouse
& brefe worke full of vtylyte,

that you may at all tymes haue
your herte eleuate, by a louyng
conuersyon vnto god, with a seruent
desyre to please hym, and per

cryenge without sease, by some fyrye
shorte prayers, and flamynge
aspyracyons on this wyse. O my

hole desyre & my ioye. when shall
I hertely loue the? when shall I
(for thy sake) contempne myne

wold I myght forsake myn owne

the vehement heat of thy loue be
consumed, transformed, and chaū
                  ged.
O lorde graunte vnto me, to
loue the, with all my herte, with al
my mynde, and with al my poures
and workes. yf I loue the with all
myne herte, then shall I loue nothyng

so well as the. yf I loue the
with all my mynde, then shall I
thynke of nothyng so moch as of yt
yf I loue the with all my poures

goost shal instructe you.
               This exercyse, and occupacyon
is moste excellent, by the whiche
you maye aske (of the moste infynyte
and great lord) large & great
petycyons. For the desyre of charyte
ought to extende it selfe with
out measure. God hym selfe commaundeth

(by his infynyte bountefulnesse)
no syghe nor grone offeryd

that you haue all redy receyued, or

neglecte by slouthfulnesse, suche
goodly benefytes, whithe you

vnto the lorde of mercy, begynne
agayne manfully, and desyre to fatygate
