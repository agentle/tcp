mercie and peace.
            
               RIght Honourable,
the importunate
desire of diuers wel
affected Christians
which heard these
sermons in London, and chiefelie
of some that haue beene humbled
with affliction of conscience,
hath preuailed with me for the
penning & publishing of the same,
which through the blessing of God

may bring cōfort & profit to more
then to those that heard them. In
regard of many honourable fauours
and good encouragements
receiued from your Lordship in
the worke of my ministerie where
I dwell. I haue presumed to offer
this my mite vnto you as
a poore testimonie of a minde
willing to be thankefull if it were
in my power, which both for the
matter that is handled therein,
as also for the manner of handling,
I deemed of right to belong
chiefelie vnto your Lordship
which (together with my good
meaning herein) if it shall please
you (which I humblie craue) to
construe and accept in good part,

I shalbe not a little encouraged to
take more paines in greater matters
then these come to. Thus crauing
pardon for my boldnes. I
humblie take my leaue, commending
you to the aboundant and
gracious blessing of God. 1598.

            Dauids thankfulnes for
the arrainement of the man
of Earth.
            
               PSAL. 10. 17. 18.
               Lord, thou hast heard the desire of
the poore,Text. thou preparest their heart,
thou bendest thine eare vnto them.
To iudge the fatherlesse, and poore,
that the man of earth cause to feare
no more.
            
            
               THis tenth Psalme
doth most liuely
describe vnto vs a
corrupt & peruerse
state of a miserable
commōwealth groning
and fainting vnder the intollerable
burthens of manifold oppressions,

and extreame iniuries
heaped vpon her by the mightie
and proud Nimrods of that time,
by cruell and craftie worldlings, by
godlesse & blasphemous Athists,
by secure, and carnall Epicures, by
loose and lawlesse Belials, which in
Dauids time like Bees swarmed in
euerie Countrey & Citie, in euery
Towne and Village, and came
about the poore seruants of God,
daily & howerlie as thicke as hailestones
in Aegypt, euen a right picture
of that wherin we now liue,
which made that princely Prophet
and propheticall prince Dauid (as
a man amazed at such a forelorne
sight, and pitifull complaining that
was on euerie side) to speake farre
otherwise of the Lord then he is indeed,
and in a kind of quarrelling
manner to expostulate the matter
with the Lord after the manner of
man, saying: Why standest thou farr of

O Lord, & hidest thy selfe in due time,
euē in affliction? euen while the wicked
with pride doth persecute the poore?
Greatlie (no doubt) did iniquitie
preuaile, & strong was the temptation;
yea to great boldnes, and courage
were the wicked growen when
it seemed to Dauid, as if the Lord
were carelesse in gouerning the
world, and had forgotten to releeue
his poore distressed people, or call
the wicked to account, but seemed
either to let thē do euen what they
listed without controlment, which
God forbid we should once imagine,
but yet in the time of afflictiō
& temptation such is the weaknes
of faith euē in the verie regenerate,
that they cōceiue somtime of God
and his works, otherwise then becōmeth
thē, or then beseemeth the
maiestie of God, the reason hereof
is, because they be for the time as
men that are buffeted and astonied

with blowes, to whose sence the
ground seemeth to turne round,
when indeed there is no such matter,
but the turning and alteration
is in themselues, and therfore the
temptations of the regenerate are
called by Paule the buffetings of
Sathan. 2. Cor. 12. 7. And yet notwithstanding
(though at a blush
they may seeme to iumpe with the
wicked, who doe alwaies harbour
within them most base and vnworthy
conceipts of the most high,
who filleth Heauen and earth with
his all seeing, and incomprehensible
presence, & with whom is neither
change nor shew of change,
yet between the godly and the wicked
there is alwaies this double differēce.
First, in the greatest afflictions,
and weaknes of faith wherwith
the godly are exercised, there is yet
some euidence of Gods sanctifying
spirit in them, supporting them

from finall and desperate falling away
from the grace of God, though
it be more then they alwaies feele
in themselues, for though Dauid
complaineth in the beginning of
this Psalme of Gods long absence,
yet he is certainly perswaded of his
presence to him, or else he had
praied in vaine. And as earthlie
Fathers haue a secret affection to
their childrē more then their children
do alwaies perceiue, so God
hath a secret hand in his children
to vphold them from falling away,
more then they alwaies doe feele,
which feeling they want somtime
to humble them, and to make
them more earnest in prayer, and
more carefull to keepe the fauor of
God when they haue it. And somtime
the Lord bestoweth secret
fauours vpon his children more
then they know of, as Iosephs brethren
had euery man his money in

his sacke by the waie, which was
more thē they knew, til they came
their Inne. Gen. 42. 27. But with the
wicked it is not so, for God hath
left them to themselues,Rom. 1. 24 2. Tim. 3. 13. giuing
them ouer to a reprobate sence
that they may wax worse & worse,
deceiuing and beeing deceiued,
there is no secret hand of Gods
grace in them, that can be perceiued
either of themselues or of others
for them. Another difference
is this: when the heat of affliction
and strength of temptation
is allaied in the godly, and they
come to themselues againe, as
men doe that haue beene beaten
and buffeted, they recall their errour,
and correct their former crazed
opinions, giuing to God afterward
that honour that is due vnto
him, but the wicked after they be a
little eased, and released of their
paine, doe turne againe to their

former vomit, neuer once dreaming
that they either thought or
spake, or did any thing amisse, or
against the glorie of God, but
praise their owne wit, doing sacrifice
to the works of their owne
fingers.
            After Dauid had complained to
the Lord of the pride and crueltie
of the wicked and very substantiallie
proued those articles which he
exhibited against them, in the 12.
verse he doth humbly sue vnto the
Lord by praier, that he would arise
and shew by some gracious effects
that he hath the poore in remembrance,
which doe commit
themselues vnto him, and
namely by breaking the arme,
that is, the power of the wicked
which they abused to mischiefe
and wronge. And at
length as one hauing obtained
his request, hee concludeth this

Psalme with a holy gratulation or
thanksgiuing vnto the Lord, for
that by his spirit he did assure him
of some remedie, by taking a iudiciall
hearing of the matter on
both sides, whereby we are taught
to pray for Gods poore distressed
people as for our selues, as also to
be as thankfull to God for his mercies
toward them as if they had
beene bestowed vpon our selues,
and in so doing shall we trie whether
we be fellow & feeling members
of the bodie of Christ, or dead
and rotten members, such as are
cut of from the bodie, and liue
not by the life of God that is in
Iesus Christ.
            
               Lord thou hast heard &c. Heere
Dauid acknowledgeth the goodnes
of God towards his poore helplesse
seruants two waies, first generally
in the 17 verse, saying. Lord, thou
hast heard the desire of the poore, then

particularly amplifying this goodnes
of God, first by setting downe
the efficient cause of the poore
mans desire, in these words. Thou
preparest their heart, then by noting
the formall cause of that readines,
and willingnes which is in God to
heare their desire in these words,
Thou bendest thine eare vnto them,
and then by the finall cause of this
goodnes, in vers. 18. & that is double,
first in respect of the poore,
and oppressed, that they may haue
iustice and right, secondly in respect
of their oppressors (who are
called in contempt the man of
earth) that they may be no more
cause of terrour to the godly.
            The first thing heere to be noted,
is how Dauid changeth his
note, for before he said, Lord thou
hast hid thy selfe, but now he saith
Lord thou hast heard the desire of the
poore, that is, thou hast shewed

thy selfe in the robes of Iustice and
iudgement, Dauid here was like
one that during the battaile could
not tell what to make of the matter,
but after the encounter is past,
like a valiant conquerer he striketh
vp, and maketh forward in triumph
saying: The Lord is King for euer
and euer, the heathen are destroyed
out of thy sight, Lord thou hast heard
the desire of the poore, thou preparest
their heart, thou bendest thine eare.
To iudge the fatherlesse and the poore,
that the man of earth cause to feare no
more.
            
            And heere we see that verified
which is in Psal. 126. 5. 6. They that
sowe in teares, shall reape in ioy: And
that which is in our prouerbe, A
harde beginning maketh a good
ending: for one woulde haue
thought by the beginning of this
Psalme that he shoulde neuer
haue obtained so happy an end,

for thus he be ginneth: Why dost thou
stand farre off O Lord, and hidest thy
selfe in time of affliction: that is, why
haue we not Iustice executed; but
he endeth as you heare: Lord
thou hast heard the desire of the poore,
&c. which is as much as can be desired.
Such a blessed and ioyfull
end will God sende vnto all his
poore afflicted seruants, when he
hath well humbled them, and
throughly exercised them with the
buffetings of Sathan, and stung
them to the very heart with the
sence and feeling of their sinnes,
and affrighted them with a terrible
shew of an angrie & wrathfull
countenance, all which the Lord
wil do against his dere childrē. First
to let thē feele & know what they
haue, & are of themselues, secondlie,
to make them acquainted with
sathans mallice, that they take heed
how they either obey him or beleue

him againe, thirdly, to make the
greatnes of his loue, and gracious
mercy more knowen in deliuering
them at the last; for by the want of
a benefit we know what a benefite
is worth, and therefore ioy restored,
is more acceptable then ioy
continued. Psal. 51. 12. And lastly
to make them fit instruments for
the conuersion and strengthning
of those that are or shalbe in the
like case, as Christ said to Peter:
Sathan hath desired to sift you,
               Luk. 22. 31. 32. 
               as wheat
is sifted, but I haue praied for thee,
that thy faith may not faile. Therfore
when thou art conuerted, strengthen
thy brethren. But in the meane time
it goeth hard for any feeling that
the afflicted soule hath of any cō
               fort
in himselfe, Oh I cannot feele
the loue of God in my heart, I
cannot find Gods spirit in my hart,
my heart is not grieued for my sin,
I cannot pray, I take no delight in

the word, &c. Oh that I could pray
that I could beleeue, that I could
feele Gods mercy in assuring my
heart of the forgiuenes of my sins,
but I haue abused his mercy, and
offended his Maiestie, and therefore
I am cast out of his sight, there
is no mercy for me, I am damned,
and shall goe to hell, &c. And
thus the poore soul etaketh on during
the winter time of afflictions,
and temptations, but soft a while,
who telleth thee that thou art cast
out of Gods sight, that thou art a
reprobate &c. Againe who told
thee that thou wantest faith and
repentance, & other graces of the
spirit? Againe who is it, or what
is it that doth so earnestly thirst
after those excellent graces of faith,
of repentance, of the forgiuenes of
sinnes, &c. Surely in this Tragedy
be three actors, and euery one doth
his part, and here is wisedome to

discerne on from the other, here is
thy owne conscience accusing, Sathan
accusing, & Gods law accusing.
Thy conscience sheweth thee
thy wants; Gods spirit sheweth thee
thy wants, & Sathan sheweth thee
thy wants; but that which God doth
in loue Sathan doth in malice, that
which God doth to humble thee
sathā doth to destroy thee; thou saist
thou canst not repent, thou canst
not beleeue, thou canst not pray:
Oh sweet mercie of God, that for
the wicked doe not so much as
know their wantes, thou art sorie
that thou canst not repent, that
thou canst not beleeue, &c. Oh
what better repentance then
to bewaile thy impenitencie?
what greater griefe then that
which ariseth for no griefe for
sinne? What is this but sorrowe
it selfe for sinne? thou
wouldest pray, thou wouldest

beleeue stedfastly, who wrought
that hunger and thirst in thee? not
flesh and blood, not Sathan, therefore
it must needs be Gods spirit,
content thy selfe thou shalt be satisfied,
and take that desire of
grace for grace it selfe, and a
pledge of further grace to be receiued
hereafter. Thou saist thou
feelest not Gods loue in thee, and
therefore he loueth thee not, but
doe the Lord no iniurie, measure
not his grace by thy feeling,
he that tooke a rib out of mans
side, while he slept in such sorte
that he felt it not, can also put a
secret hand of grace into thee, to
vphold thee while his spirit doth
sleepe in thee, and thou not feele
it, and for the proofe of that I say
consider with me, how often
haue many beene tempted to
mischiefe themselues and others,
yea and practised their owne destruction

which yet are liuing, and
well? from whence came this, but
from a secret hand of God within
them that still plucked them as a
praie out of the hands of their enenemie.
Some againe (that I know)
haue bene afraid that they should
speake blasphemie against God &
treason against the Queene, and
haue beene so tempted the runto,
that they haue held their mouthes
with their hands least it should out,
and yet when they haue beene willed
to vtter it, they could not, but
cleane contrarie, in stead of treason
and blasphemie haue spoken all
good in most heartie & holy manner
that might be both of God and
of the Queene, by which they haue
perceiued & confessed in the end
to Gods great glory, that these were
illusions of sathan, and that Gods
spirit is stronger in them then the
temptation, whē they had suposed

that God had cleane forsakē them.
Oh I am damned, I am dāned thou
criest: who told thee so? Surely it
is the voyce of Sathan that would
haue it so, beleeue him not, for he
that is compounded all of lying
and falshood cannot possibly suggest
any trueth vnto thee. Oh if I
could feele some comfort in my
soule, I were well: if I could pray
from a feeling heart and beleeue effectually
&c. then I were wel. Then
I should hope that God would be
mercifull vnto me: but content thy
selfe: there is a time for all things
saith Salomon, a time to weepe, and
a time to reioyce, so there is a time
of affliction, and a time of deliuerance
out of temptatiō, if that time
were come that thou speakest of,
then were thy afflictiō at an end, &
the tēmptation of no force not effect,
but now is the time of casting down
& of the tēpters forcible working

but waite on God, he is thy present
helpe and thy God, with patience
possesse thy soule vntill the time
be come for thy deliuerance, and
verely when Gods rods haue had
their working, to frame thee vnto
God, the time will come that thou
shalt haue diluerance, though
now thou sayest with Dauid, Lord
why standest thou farre off? and hidest
thy face, euen in the time of affliction?
yet after the conflict is ended
(which must be when God
will, and not when thou wilt) thou
shalt sing ioyfully & triumphantly,
Lord thou hast heard the desire of
thy poore seruant, thou preparest thine
heart, thou bendest thine eare, to helpe
thy poore comfortlesse seruant that
thy hellish enemie be no more cause of
feare.
            
            Againe, that in time of thy spirituall
conflict, thy soule may hope
for some more comfort & strength

in the ende then for the present
thou feelest, it shall not be amisse
for thee to call to mind the former
experience that thou hast had of
Gods goodnes towards thee in
time past, whereby thou maist
assure thy selfe that he wil be good
vnto thee againe, as Dauid said,
The Lord that hath deliuered me from
the Beare and the Lion,
               1. Sam. 17. 37. 
               will also deliuer
me from this vncircumcised philistime:
so say thou, That God which
deliuered mee from such a perill,
and gaue me strength against such
and such temptations, will one
day deliuer me from this▪ that God
which once let me feele peace and
ioy, and comfort in Christ, will
surely giue me comfort againe
when he seeth fit time: For whom
the lord loueth,Ioh. 13. 1. he loueth for euer.
And the gifts and calling of God
are without repentance saith theRom. 11. 29.
Apostle. Thy treasure is laide vp

surely in Heauē saith Christ, where
neither mothes can eate it, nor
rust can corrupt it,Mat. 6. 20. nor theeues can
digg through and steale it away,
God doth not keep it from moths
and from theeues to let the deuill
deceiue thee of it, no, it is sure for
euer, where neither man, nor Angell,
nor all the deuils in hell shall
take it from thee, no nor God himselfe,
for though we be vnfaithfull,
yet he is faithfull,2. Tim. 2. 23. and cannot
denie himselfe. And where as thou
criest out for it now, saying thou
canst not feele it in thy heart &c.
it is for that perhaps thou diddest
not vse it as thou shouldest, when
thou haddest it before, thou wert
peraduēture a lazy professor of the
Gospell, or a proud hearer of the
word, or negligent in the worship
of God, both with thy selfe and thy
familie, or it may be thou diddest
waxe proud of Gods graces, and

diddest not giue him his due honour,
or it may be thou diddest
make some rash promise (presuming
vpon thy owne strength)
that thou wouldest do this or that,
or that thou wouldest neuer commit
such and such a sinne againe.
And therfore the Lord (to let thee
know thy selfe) like a most wise father
hath for a time taken away his
graces from thee, and the feeling
of all spirituall comfort, and yet
for all that loueth thee as his
child. And heerein the Lorde
dealeth with thee, but as thou
wouldest deale with thy owne
childe if thou hast anie; when
the childe abuseth anie thing
that he delighteth in it is taken
from him, and laide vp till
another time, and he made beleeue
that it is quite taken
from him, the childe woulde
haue it alwaies in his sight,

but that may not be for diuers causes:
and in like manner dealeth the
Lord with his children, it sufficed
Iacob to heare that his sonne Ioseph
was aliue, though he saw him not,
so it should suffice the afflicted
conscience to know that Christ liueth
in him, though his spirituall
eye be so dazeled, that as yet he
cannot see him, yea there is a holy
desire to see and feele Christ in
thee, as an earnest-penny, though
it be as in a bag sealed vp, and in
time it shalbe deliuered thee, yea
though thou goest as a malefactor
that is condemned goeth to execution,
out of all hope for life, yet
(as some friend of his sueth out his
pardon for him, and deliuereth it
him euen when he is on the ladder
readie to be turned of, to his greater
ioy more then he expected, euen
to Christ Iesus hath sued out
thy pardon, and when thou thinkest

there is no waie but one with
thee, and that is to hell, euen when
thou seemest to thy selfe to be past
all hope of recouery, then shall the
spirit of Christ step vp in thy heart,
which now seemeth to be gone,
or to lie a sleepe, and shall deliuer
it vnto thee, with this message of
comfort, Sonne be of good cheere thy
sinnes are forgiuen thee. And in the
meane time know that Christ is
not gone from thee but sleepeth in
thee, as he did in the ship, and that
was but onely during the tempest,
but when they in the ship were afraid
of sinking, they cried, Saue vs
Master we perish else, and then he
awaked and rebuked the winds: so
Christ may seeme to sleep in thee
during the time of tempestuous
temptations, but whensoeuer
thou art in any danger, he is
awake to saue thee, and in the
end will rebuke Sathan and tread

him vnder thy feete; that Christs
spirit is in thee thou maiest perceiue
by the voyce of the Church
that is in thy case: In my bed by
night (saith the Church) I sought
him whom my soule loueth,Can. 5. 1. but
could not finde him, so thou
seeekest him whom thy soule loueth,
but canst not finde him, that
is, thou seekest him whom thou
hast with thee, for there is in thee
the loue of Christ, which cannot
come, but from Christ himselfe,
now the very loue of Christ in thy
heart though it be but weake, yet
is a certaine argument of Christs
sanctifying spirit in thee, for
though the reprobate may in
some sort slauishly tremble at
the iudgements of God, and for
some carnall respect, ioye in the
things of God for a time, yet there
is not in them a loue of God in
Christ Iesus: but with their seruile

feare is ioyned also a deadly hatred
of the Lord as of their mortall enemie.
            Againe if thou feele not as yet
the gracious presence of Gods spirit
in thee as thou wouldest,Psa. 43. 5. yet vse
the holy means that God hath appointed
for the conuersion & confirmation
of his children; frequent
the word preached, read in the scriptures,
& labours of the godly learned,
vse praier, & conference, and
meditatiō, & so wait on God, who
is thy present helpe and thy God,
but thou saist thou canst not heare
with delight, thou canst take no
pleasure in reading of good books,
nor hearing of them redd vnto
thee, thou canst not brooke conference
and praier, thou doest
distast them all, yet I say vse
them still, as a good man taketh
meate and drinke, and phisicke
though it be against the

stomacke, and cast vp all againe,
yet he desireth to digest it, and so
by often taking, at last doth gather
strength, and take that willingly
with hope, which before hee receiued
against his will with a kind
of loathing. So thy sicke soule by
often vsing the holy meanes that
God hath appointed, at last
through his blessing will strengthen
thee, and make thee to vse them
of loue & desire, which now thou
doest but vnchearfully and with a
certaine kind of loathing. There is
a defect in the stomacke or some other
part of the body which will
not suffer wholsome meate to be
digested; So in the inward man, the
defect may be in the vnderstanding
which may be darke, or in the memory
which may be brittle, or in the
vtterance which may be slowe,
or in thy faith which may be weak,
or in thy repentance which may be

imperfect, or in thy loue which
may be small, or in thy zeale which
may be bitter or colde, or in thy
minde which may be earthly, or in
thy affections which may be vnrulie,
or in thy whole man which
may be lumpish, heauie, and vntoward
to good things: yet in all
these remaine a double comfort.
First these graces are not counterfet,
but in trueth are such as they
seeme to be, thou vnderstandest aright,
thou vtterest the trueth
though but slowly, thou remembrest
the best things, and beleeuest
the word, and repentest in trueth,
with hatred of thy sins, and thou
louest God and his word for themselues
sake: againe so much as thou
vnderstandest and knowest, and remembrest,
& beleeuest, & louest,
thou also affectest & embracest in
heart, & desirest to grow in them,
& to practise them to the praise of

God, and therfore still hope and
wait on God, for though God
seeme now to thy soule as if he had
no care of thee, yet he doth care
for thee, and thou shalt one day
ioyfully sing as Dauid doth heere:
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of
the poore, &c.
            
            
               Lord, thou hast heard, &c.) The
Lord doth heare all mens desires,
and knoweth all their thoughtes
long before, but he is said to heare
the desires of his children after a
more speciall, and gracious manner,
because he doth in mercy both
fauour their sutes, and grant their
requests, & so this word of hearing
is to be vnderstood somtime in the
scripture, as where Dauid saith: If
I regard wickednes in my heart the
Lord will not heare me: that is, the
Lord will not grant me my desire.
And so is it taken also sometime amongest
vs in our common manner

of speaking, as when we doe
not fauour a mans suite, we use to
say, I heare you not. This is that
which the children of God doe
most groane and long for in praier,
namely to pray so, that the Lord
may heare them, that is, may afford
them a gracions hearing,
which if they may be assured of,
then are their hearts filled with ioy
whatsoeuer happeneth to them in
the world. And al their feare is, least
their sins and sinful praiers should
stop the eares not of the Lord simplie,
but of his grace and fauour against
them. To that end doe they
come before the Lord in all humilitie,
feare, and reuerence, striuing,
sighing, and groaning and troubled
in spirit. And to this end the
Lord oftentimes seemeth vnto
his children as one that is deafe,
he maketh them no answere,
but takes away from them for

the time all feeling of comfort in
praier, to that ende that when he
doth speake peace vnto their harts,
they may know what a mercy they
haue receiued from his Maiestie.
            But wicked hypocrites regard
not so much whether the Lord
doth heare thē or no, but whether
men do heare them, that is all their
care: they pray to be seene of men,
and to be heard of men, onelie labouring
with their lips, but without
anie strife of the heart. They
pompe it, they chant it, they howle
it, and throate it to please themselues
and others, but whether all
that paines of theirs be accepted
with God, they neuer so much as
once thinke: So that when they
haue done their stint and taske,
they may saie as the harlot said, of
whom Salomon speaketh,Pro. 7. 14. 
               To daie
I had peace-offerings, I haue payed
my vowes, and so leaue for that

matter, it is no matter whether
they be receiued or no, she hath
paid them, so saith the Hipocrit, I
haue said all my praiers to day, I
haue done al my deuotion, & there
leaue for that matter; but the poore
child of God whose soule groaneth
vnder the buthen of his sins,
doth not so much boast of the saying
of his praiers, as he doth of
Gods mercy in hearing his praiers,
Lord I thank thee saith (the Pharisie)
that I fast and praie so often in
a weeke, but Lord be mercifull
to me saith the Publican, Lord I
praied in thy temple saith the one,
as the wicked in the Gospell, Lord
we haue heard thee preach in our
streets; but the other saith, Lord,
thou hast heard the desire of thy
poore seruants,Doctr. 3., blessed be thy name
for that fauour: the desire. He doth
not say their cryings, or their sententious
and eloquent praiers, or

the voice of their lips, although
the desires of the heart be counted
cryings with the Lord, but he
saith: That the Lord hath heard
the desire of the poore: Which
are the cries and praiers, and
voices of the inwarde man,
though not alwaies vttered by
the tongue, to shewe that the
Lord of his goodnes is so readie
to heare the afflicted, that
he doth not alwaies expect the
cryings, and voyces of the outwarde
man, or the orderly and
set praiers of the lips, for before
they cry, he heareth them according
to the testimonie of the
Prophet Esay, who (speaking
in the person of God) saith thus:
Before they call I will aunswere,
               Eisai. 65. 24
               and while they speake I will heare.
And Saint Paule sayeth. The
spirit it selfe likewise helpeth
our infirmities, for wee know

not what to praye as wee
ought: but the spirit maketh request
for vs with groaninges,Rom. 8. 20
which cannot be expressed: that
is, the spirite helpeth our weake
prayers which want strength to
come forth, and accepteth the
verie sighes and groanes of the
heartes of Gods children in stead
of prayers, as the tender nurse
doth the monefull lookes of the
babe that lyeth in the cradle
full of payne, and cannot
speake.
            And these inwarde desires,
and groanes of GODS children,
are to the children of God
as an earnest-pennie of the spirit,
and as the first fruites of
the spiritituall haruest, now an
earnest-pennie is but a pledge
or assurance of a thousande
pounde to be payed in time,
and the first fruits of the corne are

but a sheafe or handfull as it were
of the whole haruest which afterwards
is to be reaped. And this
may serue to comfort the afflicted
conisciences which cannot pray
as they would sometime and therfore
thinke they are not regarded
of God, it serueth onely to comfort
the afflicted soule I say, but
no way to confirme vs in our sluggish,
slouthfull, drousie, and sleepie
praiers.
            
               Of the poore.) The state of Gods
children in this life is not alwaies
of the best,Doctr 4. neither in outward account
with the world, nor yet in
their owne feeling. And therfore
they are called sometime: The afflicted
ones,Pro. 15. 15 as in Pro. 15. 15. All
the daies of the afflicted are euill:
Sometime the hungry and thirstie,
as in Mat. 5. Blessed are those that
hunger and thirst after righteousnes.
Sometime little wormes as in Esay,

Little worme Iacob: And in the
Psalmes, I am a worme and no man,
saith Dauid: And sometime,2. Tim. 3. 12. 
               The
little flocke,
               1. Cor. 1. As in Luke 12. And in
this place they are called,Psa. 41. 8. 
               The poore:
For whosoeuer will liue godly in
Christ Iesus must suffer affliction.
And they doe still hunger & thirst
after Christ their righteousnes:
            
               As the Hart doth after the riuers of
water, Like little wormes they are
contemned and trodden vpon by
euerie one: And like poore and
miserable persons they are alwaies
in need of Gods grace and helpe.
And yet they in that account with
God that he heareth their desires:
The afficted haue a continualfeast,
The hungry shalbe filled with good
things, when the rich shalbe sent
emptie away. The little worme Iacob
is written vpon the palmes of
the Lords hands, and is euer in his
sight. The little flocke neede not

feare for their littlenes, for they
haue the kingdome. And the
poore seruants of God which are
alwaies in need and want of Gods
grace and fauour, and alwaies bewailing
their owne pouertie and
want, are heard of the Lord, and
therefore are both rich and happye.
            This may teach vs to iudge
wisely of the poore children of
GOD that are in contempt, and
tribulation in the worlde; and
louingly to embrace them as
members of our bodie though
in shewe vnderlinges to all; like
the feete, or rather like the
footstooles of the wicked, and
not to despise them: For the
Lorde heareth the desires euen of
the poore. Yea and they may
pleasure vs more with their
praiers, then we can hurt them
with our persecutions. There

is not the best, nor learnedest
Doctor in the Church, nor
the greatest or wealthiest man in
the commonwealth but may, and
doth receiue helpe and benefit by
the praiers of the poorest man
that liueth, if he be a godlie
man.
            
               Thou preparest, &c. Heere
Dauid acknowledgeth a double
grace or fauour of God, First,
that he vpholdeth his children,
that they fainte not vnder their
burthens, for he armeth them
with courage, and patience,
putting vpon their heades the
helmet of good hope, and stirring
them vp, thereby to dispatch
their prayers as speedie
postes and messengers vnto the
hilles from whence commeth
their helpe. A singular benefite
surelie to haue our senses
and thoughtes setled in Gods

prouidence, and not caried awaie
to worldlie deuises, and desperate
attempts. Secondly, God hauing
thus prepared & setled their harts
for praier, he doth also prepare &
settle himselfe to heare their praiers,
yea, because their praiers be
but weake and feeble, that scarce
haue any perfect voice, but make
a soft and still noise, in the secret
corners of their hearts, the Lord
doth bend his eare vnto them, and
laie it close vnto their mouth, in
most fatherly, friendly, and tender
sort, that so he might know what it
is that they whisper so inwardly,
& so faintly. from hence we learne.
            First,Doctr. 5. that to direct our desires
to God in affliction is a speciall
worke, and fauour of God in our
hearts, for otherwise, affliction of
it selfe doth breede rather impatience,
and dispaire, then any comfortable
hope, and heart to praier.

And therfore let vs be admonished
when (in any kind of affliction,
crosse, and temptation) we feele
any comfort in God, or desire to
goe vnto his Maiestie, by praier to
giue him the whole glorie, and
take it as a token of his loue vnto
vs. Let vs also acknowledge our
owne weaknesse, and inabilitie to
prepare our hearts, our selues to
Godward. And most false, and insolent
is that popish assertion of
freewill in man to praie when he
will, and to beleeue when he will,
and repent when he will, for it is
God (saith the Apostle) that worketh
both the will and the deede.
Lastly,Phil. 2. 13. let vs hereby be encouraged
to goe to God although it be
with broken praiers, and fainting
desires, we shall not loose our labour,
no the godly doe not in
vaine direct their desires to God,
nor in hope and patience want

vpon him because the eares of
the Lord are open and bent, ready
in most gracious manner to heare
the groanes of his poore afflicted
seruants. And thus much
of the manner and matter in generall
of Dauids thanksgiuing.
         
         
            
            The second Sermon.
            VVherein is handled
in particular the matter it selfe,
for which Dauid giueth thanks
and that is the arraignement of
the man of earth.
            
               PSAL. 10. 18.
               To iudge the fatherlesse and the poore,
that the man of earth cause to feare
no more.
            
            
               IN the former verse,
Dauid praiseth God
for hearing the desires
of his poore seruants,
but now he sheweth more particularly
what was their desire, and
wherein God hath heard them at
the last, namely, they desire
that GOD woulde iudge and

determine betweene them & their
oppressors, and this is the thing
that God hath granted them, from
whēce the faithfull may learne this
comfortable generall doctrine,
that when they shalbe vniustly oppressed,
God at length wilbe reuenged
of their aduersaries, and
deliuer his children; which may
serue to admonish vs to endure the
crosse manfully, because God will
not many times helpe his poore
children before they be brought to
extreame danger. A hard thing
this is to flesh and blood, because
euery one desireth to be free from
trouble, and therfore except God
doth quickly helpe, he seemeth
to be slow in helping or forgetfull
of his promises (which God forbid
we should imagine) but if we
desire his helpe, we must wait his
leasure, our affections must be tamed,
our impatience must be beaten

downe, our griefes must be mitigated,
vntill our extreeme miseries
may prouoke the fauour of
God, and to this purpose is that
parable of the poore Widow and
the wicked Iudge propounded by
our Sauiour Christ in the Gospell
and in this sort applied to God and
his children: that if a wicked Iudge
fearing neither God nor man,Luke. 18. 7 will
notwithstanding be ouercome
with importunate suters at last to
doe them iustice, how much more
will God that is a most righteous
Iudge, and all righteousnes it selfe,
heare at length his poore children
which call and crie day and night
vnto him for Iustice.
            
               That earthly man, &c.) The wicked
lift vp their heads aboue the
clouds and yet are but mortall, and
subiect to many miseries, and therfore
are they called men of earth, to
shame them and to humble them:

for this is their insolent madnes,
and mad insolencie, while they
forget their estate, and condition
they breath out threateninges
as Saul did against the Church of
God, as if God himselfe were not
sufficient to represse their rage.
And yet they are but men, & men
of earth too, & come against God
as if wormes should come out of
the ground to fight against their
maker, or as if an earthen pitcher
should encoūter with a mountaine
of Brasse; they are made of earth,
yea and of the baseft earth to; euen
of the dust of the earth. Clay is
good for somthing, Sand is good
for somthing, Marle is good for
somthing, Dung is good for somthing,
Grauel is good for somthing
and earth is good for something,
but Dust is good for nothing,
except it be to put out mens eyes,
& of that is mā made, which cōsideratiō
may greatly humble the hiest,

the stoutest, the brauest, & the
proudest, but the wicked according
to their making do sauour nothing
else but earth, and the most vile
things of the earth, and therefore
are fitly called earthly, because
they liue like earth wormes.
            And though there be legions, &
miltitudes of them, yet are they
here called by a word of the singular
number, Man of earth, not men.
And that may be either in regard of
their wicked vnity, or else in regard
of their great inability to effect that
which they purpose whē God shal
crosse thē.Pro. 1.24. In wickednes they ioyne
altogether as one mā. Cast in thy lot
amongst vs (say theeues & murtherers)
we will haue all one purse. And in
like manner the wicked in all euill
ioyne as one man. And yet they
shall do no more then one man alone,
and that of earth too, & that
is little, or nothing, except it be to
their own ouerthrow as the Egytiās
               
did when they all followed the
poore Israelites into the sea. For
man of earth what is hee? what
can he doe? what is his beginning?
what is his bringing vp? and what
is his ending? Is he not begotten
of wickednes, conceiued of wretchednes,
and borne of weakenes,
worse then a dunghill? Is he not
brought vp in ignorance & blindnes,
in folly and vanitie? Is not
he against God, and God against
him? His life is death, and his
death is double, temporall, and eternall,
for the second hath no end:
what can he doe? Doth he liue,
moue, & breath? it is by God. Pilates
power was from aboue. And
while God doth giue him leaue to
breath, and to possesse the world,
he is cruell, carnall proud, and obstinate,Act. 17. 28
He is like the image in the
second of Daniel, whose head was
of Gold, his breast and armes were

of Siluer, his belly and his thighs
of Brasse, but his legges were of
Iron, and his feete of Iron & Clay,Dan. 2. 32
And in like sort is the state of great
earthly worldlings compounded
with their golden heads and stately
buildings, with their siluer
breastes and armes, and costly apparrell,
with their brasen thighes
and mightie friends, with their Iron
legges and strong supporting
liuings, they make a terrible shew,
but with their Iron earthly feete,
with their hard heartes, and earthlie
affections they are caried vp &
downe in the world, which hitting
against one little stone, cut without
hands, that is Christ Iesus and his
Gospell that lie in their waies, as
a stone of offence to stumble vpon,
they crumble and fall downe to
their vtter spoyle and euerlasting
ouerthrowe.
            But the heauenlie man shalbe able

through God to stand, and
to doe valiantlie, and therefore
they are called the man of
God,a. Tim. 3. 17 because the faithfull are as
one man, also vnited by the communion
of Saintes, and hauing
God amongest them are able to
doe great matters. Princes, Magistrates,
Preachers are made of
earth too, yet hauing but a sparke
of Gods Maiestie in them, or rather
but the reflexion of a sparke
of Gods power and Maiestie vpon
them, are mightie and terrible
through Gods spirit, and ought
to be terrible to all Gods enemies,
and wicked men, but not to the
innocent, and godlie: if they vse
or abuse their power which God
hath put in them, to the cooling
of any good mans courage, or to
the quenching of the spirit, or to
the disgracing or oppressing of
poore Christians as many doe, as

though they were Gods, and not of
earth, surely God will iudge them,
& make thē that they shal no more
terrifie his children then Pharao
that proud hearted King, and the
Aegyptians his subiects which laye
drowned in the bottome of the
sea: and so much be the meaning
of the words. Now to the matter
of Dauids thanksgiuing.
            
               Dauid praiseth God for iudging
betweene his poore seruants, and
their oppressors. This is that for
want whereof he complaineth in
the first verse. This is it for wante
wherof the wicked were so lusty to
contemne God. By this he will
breake the armes, that is, the power
of the wicked and search out
their wickednes. This is the poore
Churches desire, namely a iudiciall
hearing. And to this ende hath
God prepared their hearts, and
to this ende doth the Lord encline

his eare vnto them, namely,
To sit in iudgment vpon the poore
mans case, So that, when God
doth proceede against the wicked
it is in iudgement. And though the
poore commit his cause vnto God,
yet it shalbe iudged, and without
a iudiciall proceeding shall nothing
be done: for God is no acaccepter
of persons as men be,
though he loueth the godly, yet
they shall stand to their triall, and
though he hateth the wicked, yet
they shall haue their triall, all shall
be iudged, and all wronges shall
be righted by iudgement: therfore
it is saide in the Psalme, The Lord
shall iudge the people righteously:
               Psa. 67. 4. This
maketh the godly so willingly to
appeale vnto God, saying as Sarai
said to Abraham,
               Gen. 16. 5. 
               The Lord be
Iudge betweene me and thee.
            
            God hath erected iudgement
feates on earth vpon whom he hath

set Princes and rulers, and graced
them with his owne name, and
sittes amongst them, to make them
to be honoured and regarded;Psal. 82. I. And
their iudgments are, or should be
Gods iudgements, but oftentimes
through corruption good matters
are borne downe, & bad matters
are borne vp, we see the complaint
of Amos proue too true.
            
               They turne iudgement to wormewood
(saith hee) and leaue of righteousnes.
And that also of Esay. By
conceiuing and vttering out of the
heart false matters,
               Amos. 5. 7
                     •
                  
                
               iudgement is turned
backe,
               Esai. 59. 13. 14 15 16 
               and iustice standeth farre of:
for trueth is fallen in the streete, & iniquitie
cannot enter, yea trueth faileth
(saith the Prophet) and he that refraineth
from euill maketh himselfe a
pray: But what? was there no remedie?
how did the Lotd take this
geare? marke what followeth,
when the Lord saw it, it displeased

him that there was no iudgement.
And when he saw that there was no
man,
               16 
               he wondred that none would offer
himselfe. But is that all? verily
no. Therefore his arme did saue it,
that is his power did rescue the
praie, and his righteousnes it selfe
did sustaine it, that is he himselfe
tooke the matter in hand: For he
put on righteousnes as an habergeon,
               17
               and an helmet of saluation vpon his
head: as if he were to goe amongst
his enemies: He put on the garments
of vengeance for a cloathing,
               18
               & was clad with zeale as with a cloak,
as to recompence, and to requite the
furie of the aduersaries, he will fully repaie
the Ilands. So shall they feare the
name of the Lord from the West,
               19 
               and
his glorie from the rising of the sunne,
for the enemie shall come like a floode,
but the spirit of the Lord shall chase
him away, And this is the godly
poore mans comfort.
            
               Therefore saith the Psalmist: Let
the people be glad and reioyce, for thou
shalt iudge the folke righteously, andPsal. 67. 4
               gouerne the nations of the world. And
Paule saith:The. 4. 6. 7. 
               It is a righteous thing
with God to recompence tribulation to
them that trouble you: And to you
which are troubled rest with vs, when
the Lord Shall shew himselfe from heauen
with his mightie Angels. And in
his first Epistle speaking of the
same matter in other wordes, he
concludeth thus:The. 4. 18. 
               Comfort your selues
one another with these words. And
heere Dauid reioyceth, and praiseth
God for that he will iudge the
poore and fatherlesse. Iustice and
equitie in the world, and from the
world are two of the hardest, the
dearest, the rarest iewels that cā be
gottē: the poore do desire thē, God
hath granted their desire to iudge
the fatherles & the poore that the
mā of earth cause to feare no more.
            
               And here now we see that verified
which is in Psal. 126. 5.Psal. 126. 5. 
               They that
sow in teares, shall reape in ioy: And
that which we haue in a prouerbe.
A hard beginning maketh a good
ending, for one woulde haue
thought by Dauids beginning of
this Psalme, that he should not
haue made so good an end, for thus
he beginneth: Why doest thou hide
thy selfe aad stand a farr off O Lord in
time of affliction? That is, Why
haue we not iustice? but he endeth
as you heare: Lord thou hast hearde
the desire of the poore, to iudge, &.
which is as much as can be desired.
But let vs reason a little with
Dauid abou this matter. How is
it that thou beginning so rudely
doest speed so well in the end? If
the God of heauen should haue
dealt with thee Dauid, as the Gods
of the earth doe with their suters,
it were a wonder that euer thou

shouldest finde so much fauour,
for though thy matter were good,
yet thou mightest haue marred it
in the handling, thou diddest vtter
one speach that was inough to
haue spilled all: Why doest thou
hide thy selfe, &c. What an vnreuerent,
rash, and vnaduised speach
was this to vtter to the Lord of
Heauen and Earth? would the
Gods of the earth haue takē such a
speach at thy hand, or at any poore
mans hand? No Dauid no, many
haue sustained great wrong by wicked
men, and haue had good causes,
that for such a word, yea for a
lesse offence then thine haue bene
very hardly dealt withal, whē they
haue but craued iustice &c. Now
thy fault is greater, and God is a
seuere God, it is to be maruailed
then how thou diddest escape, and
speede so well as thou diddest
            It is true indeed (saith Dauid)

I confesse my frailtie, and my fault
to be great, and so must they also
that speake rashly before Gods
Magistrates, but if the Lord should
narrowly marke euery word that is
spoken or euery thing that is done
amisse as men doe, who coulde
stand before him? No, the Lord
knoweth whereof we be made, and
considereth in mercy that through
extreame heate of passionate affections,
and weaknes of faith his
children be caried many times beyond
themselues, but vpon their
humble submission, and vnfained
repentance he freely forgiueth thē
though men will not. Yea the Lord
in mercie doth put a difference betweene
his seruants, & his enemies
though men many times will not,
I recanted my opinion and sayde,
The Lord is king for euer and euer,
& for all my rude beginning haue
through Gods mercy obtained a

good ending: Praised be the Lord
which hath hearde the desire of the
poore, to iudge the fatherlesse, and the
poore, that the man of earth cause to
feare no more. A notable example
for earthen Gods, magistrates
I meane, to follow, and not with
bitternes, and rigour to censure,
and in extremitie to prosecute euerie slip,
and aduantage of poore
ministers, and other honest men
when they come to complaine before
them, but with loue & words
of graue and gracious counsell to
heale, or at least to couer the sore,
least the vncircumcised doe reioyce
and triumph ouer their fathers
and brethren, as cursed Cham
did at his fathers nakednes. And
so much for the bringing of the
beginning, and ending of Dauids
petition together. Nowe
let vs heare a little more of the
thing it selfe that the Lord hath

granted, and that is this, that it
will please his Maiestie to heare &
determine betweene his poore
people on the one side, and their
cruell oppressors on the other side.
In all respects it may be resembled
vnto a purchased Assises, wherin
we are to consider, First the parties
betweene whom the controuersie
dependeth, Secondly, before
whom it is to be tried. Thirdly,
by whom it must be tried.
Fourthly, the action that is to be
tryed. Fiftly, the verdict of the Iurie.
Sixtly the sentēce of the Iudge.
And lastly the execution of the
sentence. And this course we may
safely take, both because Gods spirit
hath in like sort set foorth the
iudgement seat of God, and euerie
thing to be tried before the
same,Reu. 20. 11. 12 after the manner of earthly
Iudges: for our greater capacitie
and vnderstanding, as also because

this kind of teaching doth nearest
sute with the teaching of our Sauiour
Christ, who stil vsed such familiar
similitudes to explaine his doctrine
by, as were most familiarly
knowen vnto men. Then first of
the parties betweene whom the
pleading is. The plaintiuesPlaintiues are
poore and fatherlesse: such as for
want of worldly abilitie are faine
to sue for their right In forma pauperum,
as commonly all good causes
doe, yea, whosoeuer will speed
in Gods Court must come, In forma
pauperis, for the Lord taketh no
fees, and standeth for the poore as
well as for any other. The defendantsDefendāts
or parties arraigned are all
oppressors of the poore, all Athistes,

craftie, and subtill hunters of the
poore. There sit in CommissionCōmissioners.
with the King, his owne sonne,
the sonne of God the Lord Iesus

to iudge the world. And with him
sit as it were assistants,Act. 17. 13. 24. elders
cloathed with white rayments of
Christes righteousnes,Reuel. 4. 4. and crowned
with golden crownes of heauenly
glory and authoritie. The
ministers or messengers that attēd
on this Court are the heauely Angels
of God,Mat. 24. 31.
               Psa. 68. 17. who for their swiftnes
in executing their charge are
said to haue many wings, and for
their great power are called principalities,
thrones, and dominations.Mat. 3. 3.
The criers of this court are
the preachers of the word,Esai. 40. whose
voices must be lifted vp like trumpets
to summon men before the
iudgment seat of God. The bookes
of the court be of two sorts, bookes
of statutes, and bookes of record.
But where is the prisoner?Apo. 20. 12 He standeth
taken with his owne iniquity,Pro. 5. 22

owne sin. Now thē the arrainment.
Crier lift vp thy voyce like a trumpet,
and call forth the man of earth,
Sargants strip him out of al his glorious
titles and dignities, seaze vpon
all that he hath, & let him heare
his enditement, Man of earth hold
vp thy hand, thou art endited here
by the name of (Man of Earth)
not Gentleman, Nobleman, nor
yeoman, but plaine man of earth
borne of earth, and brought vp like
an earth-worme, &c. For that
thou on such a day, and of such a
moneth in such a yeare, hauing receiued
an arme, that is to say, power,
wealth, and authoritie, hast abused
the same, and by force and
fraud didst set vpon thy poore brother,
& fatherles neighbour, liuing
& trauelling in gods peace: & meaning
thee no harme, didst put thē in
feare, so that of their credit, life, &
goods they did dispaire, what saiest

thou to this fellonie art thou guiltie
or not guiltie? Not guiltie my
Lord. How wilt thou be tried?
By my honest neighbors, (he saith)
yea sir, I can bring the handes and
seales of all the parish where I
dwell for my good behauiour. Yea,
but that is not inough man of earth,
thou must be tried by God and his
Church. Call a Iurie. The Iurie
that must goe vpon thee is impannelled
of Prophets, and Apostles,
Their names are set downe in the
old and new Testament, what canst
thou say against them? Oh my
Lord, I haue to except against them
all, They are not my friends, they
& I could neuer agree, they speake
of malice, because I woulde not
heare them, nor be ruled by them,
nor giue them their demaund, well
that is no matter, they are holy
men and such as were led by the
holy Ghost, 2. Pet. 1. 22. Therfore

man of earth hold vp thy hand againe,
and heare thy second enditement.2. Enditement. Thou art endited by
the name of the man of earth, for
Athisme and contempt of God.
vers. 3. 4. Also, thou art endited
for abusing and oppressing the
poore by cruell and craftie practises,3. Enditement.
               vers. 7. 8. 9. 10. Also for speaking
blasphemie & treason against
God and his trueth, vers. 11. Also
for taking part with the wicked,
and standing against the cause of
the innocent. Also thou art endited
for obstinate prophaning and
violating of the Lords saboaths, as
also for abusing thy stewardship,
and excessiue spending thy substance,
vaine and vnprofitable exercises,
whereby thou madest thy
selfe vnfit to doe the workes of
thy calling, to prouide for thy familie▪
to releeue the poore, or to
benefit the Church, or to maintaine

religious exercises for thy
vaine sportes and delights, lighter
then vanitie it selfe. What
sayest thou to all and euerie of
these, art thou guiltie or not
guiltie? Not guiltie. How wilt
thou be tryed? by my honest
neighbours I would be tried?
but if there be no remedie,
then I must be tried by God
and his Church: Call forth the
plantife. Poore man, and fatherlesse,
come forth, and feare
not, you shall be heard, what can
you say against this man of earth,
and how doe you proue these articles
you haue heere obiected against
him? My Lord then this we
say, They haue most proudly and
cruelly persecuted vs with inquisitiōs,Vers. 2.
slaunders, & fines, with taxes,
and vexations, and haue almost
beggared vs, againe, they haue boasted

of their owne hearts desire,
they haue blessed themselues, and
contemned thy seruantes.Vers. 3 The
more thou hast done for them,Vers. 5. 7▪
               
the lesse haue they feared thy
iudgementes. His mouth is full
of cursing, and deceipt, he hath
lien in waite in the villages. As8
a Lion in his denne so lurketh
he in waite secretly, for his
prey, by his crouching,9 and bowing
he maketh the poore to fall by
heapes into his nets,10 thus he hath
vsed vs. And as for his blasphemies
they are most outragious.
He hath said in his heart, That
the Lord seeth not, nor regardeth.
All this we could prooue
by manie which are afraide to
speake the trueth, for feare of
their displeasure, for that some of
them are their landlords, some are
their masters, some are Iustices of
peace, some are their patrōs, some

finde them worke, &c. But Lord
thou hast seene it thy selfe, for
thou beholdest mischiefe and
wrong:Vers. 14. 
               That thou mayest take it
into thy handes, therefore to thee
we appeale. You of the grand Iurie,
you haue hearde your euidence, and it is all verie true
that the poore and fatherlesse
haue enformed, for I haue seene
it my selfe (faith the Lord) therfore
now giue in your verdict,
who shall speake for you? Dauid
because he is a princely prophet,
and therefore deserueth to be
foreman, he shall speake for
vs. What say you then, is the man
of earth guiltie of all and singular
those matters where of he hath
beene endited or no? yea Lord
(saith Dauid) he is guiltie.
            Well then, Man of earth, thou
seest that thou art cōuicted by the
verdict of the great inquest of the

Prophets and Apostles, my selfe
being witnesse. What saiest thou
to the recordes of thy owne
Court?Court of consciēce described For I haue giuen thee
that priuiledge more then all creatures
besides, to keepe Court in
thy owne house, to that ende I
haue giuen thee will and affections,
to moue and to debate thy
matters, iudgement and vnderstanding
to descerne of causes, and
memorie as a register to recorde
thy causes, and conscience as a
Iudge, and a thousand witnesses to
determine of all thy proceedings.
And this Court is called the Court
of Conscience, thou shalt also be
tried by that. In that Court be
many examinations, many witnesses,
and many recordes. The
hall is common equitie, there are
many sentences in tables fayrely
engrauen, as in one place loue
God aboue all, in another, Loue

thy neighbour as thy selfe, in another,
doe as thou wouldest be
done vnto, in another, doe no
wrong: Suum cuique tribuito, &c.
Perhaps thou wilt saie, they that
belong to that Court haue troubled
thee and disquieted thee, and
therefore they are not thy friends,
I know it well, and therefore thou
wouldest not heare them: Thou
hast also disquieted and vexed
them, and therefore wouldest be
loath to be tried by them, I know
also thy corrupt dealing with that
Court, how with false perswasions
thou hast blinded reason, and
peruerted iudgement, how thou
hast fed vnderstanding with false
informations and blinded her eyes
with false loue, how thou hast put
the two Iudges out of commission
the loue of God, and the loue of
thy neighbour, & in steed of them
hast aduanced selfeloue, and partialitie.

How ignorance and wilfulnes
haue pleaded thy matters,
and malice hath euer beene one of
the Iurie, how crueltie, and pride
haue beene thy assistantes, and
weaknes, and discretion haue
beene put out of doores; how falshood
and briberie haue informed
the Iurie, and trueth and honestie
haue stood at the barre, how Barrabas
the murtherer was released,
and Christ the Lord of life was
crucified, how thou hast seared
that Court with hote iron for offending
thee, and Conscience her
selfe thou thoughtest thou haddest
hanged long agoe. All this I
Know, and a great deale more, but
now I haue raised vp Conscience
againe, and set all her attendantes
in commission againe.
The recordes are finer written,
& extant, Lo, where they stand all
before me; here selfeloue & malice

haue nothing to doe, what sayest
thou to all this, wherefore
hast thou done thus and thus,
why doth the wicked contemne
God? why hast thou said in thy
heart, the Lord doth not regard?
why speakest thou not? what?
art thou dumbe? hast thou nothing
to say?
            Besides all this, heere commeth
in now a pettie Iurie of life
and death against thee, chosen
out from among my dumbe and
vnreasonable creatures, all which
cry for vengeance against thee,
as thy brothers blood for one, the
earth that drewe in his blood
for another, the beame in thy
house for another, and then the
stone in the wall,Gen. 4. 10 the beast thou
rodest vpon,Haba. 2. 11 thy money that thou
tookest for a bribe,Num. 22. 28. then thy cruell
and craftie Bandes and Obligations,Mat. 27. 3.
then thy merciles pledges

and forfaitures that thou swallowedst
vp, then they pettifoggers thē
thy craftie counsellers, and then
thine owne seruants and children,
and thy table that thou toldest thy
money vpon, the verie Penne &
Inke that thou wrotest withall,
thy bed that thou laiest vpon,
and thy chamber doore that thou
diddest keepe fast shut while thou
committest thy filthinesse, and by
and by thy owne tongue shall find
thee guiltie, all these my creatures
and subiectes are come in
to testifie their humble alleageance
and loyall duetie to me
their maker, against thee that
hast abused them, what sayest
thou now? speake, art thou guiltie
or not? Iudas being conuicted
by the Court of conscience,
said he was guiltie in betraying
of innocent blood, and so went
and hanged himselfe, Cain being

conuicted by the Court of Conscience,
said also he was guiltie
in shedding of his brothers blood,
and so became a desperate runnagate.
In like sort was Achitophel
conuicted of treason against
King Dauid, and he went home
and hanged himselfe. All these
were condemned by the Court
of Conscience, and thinkest thou
to escape? Conscience bring in
thy verdict, what saist thou Conscience
to the man of earth (who
thought that thou had dest beene
hanged long agoe) is he guiltie of
those seuerall enditements, which
haue beene preferred against him
by the poore and fatherlesse,
and found against him by the
grand Iurie of my seruants the
Prophets and Apostles or no? we
finde saith the Court of Conscience,The verdict of consciēce
that such a one man of
earth, by Gods prouidence sometime

Prince, of such a Nation,
and such a one sometime
Bishoppe of such a Prouince,
and such a one Maior of such
a towne, and such a one Iustice
of such a Diuision, and
such a one Minister of such a congregation,
and such a one Lawyer
in such a Court, and such
a one Landlorde of such tennantes,
And such a one Corne
badger in such a Countrey, and
euerie one of them, and many
moe, whose names and bils of
enditementes are seuerallie recorded
in the booke of Gods
euerlasting knowledge; and all
and euerie of them, but men of
earth forgetting themselues, abusing
their place that GOD
gaue them, and hauing not the
feare of GOD before their
eyes are guiltie of all, and euerie
seuerall enditement that

hath beene commenced against
them. Verie well. What? Did
they flie for the same? Yea Lord
they did flie, for as the light of
thy word did follow them, so they
did in a deadly hatred of the same
seeke darkenes, when they were
reproued by the preacher, they
would come no more at the sermon.
When they haue beene
looked for at the Church, then
they haue beene at the bowles,
or at the cardes, or at the tables,
or at the alehouses, or at their
worldlie busines, or about some
other horrible wickednes, to verifie
the saying: Qui malè agit odit
lucem: He that doth euill, hateth
the light. VVe'l. VVhat goods,
lands, or tenements had they at the
time of their apprehension? They
had none of their owne, for they
were all tenants at will, yet we
finde that they were very welthy

many of them, and great in worldly
substance. For first, Thou hast
filled their bellies with thine hidden
treasures, so that they haue
inough for themselues, and leaue
inough for their children after thē.
Secondly, That wealth which thou
gauest them, O Lord, hath encreased:
neither are they in penurie
as others are. Thirdly the spoiles
of the poore are in their houses,Iob. 21.
and as great fishes deuoure many
small fishes,Psal. 73. so they haue gotten
many liuings into their handes,
and many mens trades and offices
into their handes. And this is the
verdict of the Courte of conscience,
which doth finde him guiltie
also of much more, as namely
of hypocrisie, of vaineglorie, of
contēpt of Gods word, of cōtempt
of man, and of diuers villanous
practises done in secret, which

are knowen onely to God, for
Saint Iohn saith. If our heart condemne
vs,1. Ioh. 3. 20 God is greater then our
heart and knoweth all things. And
thus much for the triall of the man
of earth. Now let vs heare the sentence
of the Iudge.
            Man of earth (saith the Iudge)
thou hast beene endited of diuers
and sundrie enditements, to the
which thou hast pleaded not guiltie,
and yet notwithwanding being
tried by the grand Iurie of the
holy Prophets, and men of God,
as also by the verdict of the Court
of thy owne conscience, hast
beene conuicted, and found guiltie
of them all. Therefore nowe
what canst thou say for thy selfe,
why sentence of eternall death
should not be pronounced against
thee according to the lawe? In
earthlie iudgementes, this question

is put to two sortes of persons,
First, such as are quitt by
booke, Secondly to such as cannot
haue that benefit. So likewise
in this heauenly iudgement.
This question is propounded
both to the elect, as also to the
reprobate. To the elect it is said,
what canst thou say for thy selfe?
They staight waie condemne
themselues as Dauid did of bloudguiltinesse.
Psal. 51. as Iob did
his children for blaspheming
GOD in their mirth and feastinges,
as Peter did his fall
from Christ, euen with bitter
teares, and as Paule did,
who saide, he was a chiefe sinner,
crying out, O wretched
man that I am &c. and as the
prodigall childe did: Father I
haue sinned against Heauen,
and against thee, and am no more
worthie to be called thy sonne,

but yet for them (thus condemning
and humbling themselues)
there is some comfort: VVhat,
canst thou beleeue in me, (saith
the Iudge) and repent from the
bottome of thy heart, canst thou
read thy name in the booke of life?
To which question euery one doth
answere as he is prompted by the
spirit of God, I beleeue and repent
but not of my selfe, it is the gift of
God, I beleeue, Lord helpe my
vnbeliefe. And with Zaccheus
they promise restitution of goods
ill gotten.Luke. 19. 8 And with Dauid they
pray: Oh that my waies were so directed,
               Psa. 119.
               that I might keepe thy statutes
alwaies: VVell (saith the Iudge)
then heare your sentence. The
Court doth award you this punishment,The sentence of the godly
you shall be crossed and afflicted
in this world sometime in
your bodies. Sometimes in your
goods, sometimes in your children,

you shall also be stung with
the hote iron of an afflicted and
woūded cōsciēce, you shalbe whip
ped & scourged with venemous, &
slaunderous tongues of wicked mē,
& a great deale more thē this shall
happen vnto you heere, that you
may not be damned with the wicked
world, & so go your way, and
sin no more, least a worse thing happen
vnto you,1. Cor. 11. 32. but before you can
be quite discharged, you must remēber
to put in Death as a cōmon
baile for your forth cōming whersoeuer
you shall be called for,Iohn 8 11 and
my owne sonne Iesus Christ as a
speciall suertie for your debt, and
good behauiour, and so paying
your fees of obedience, & newnes
of life, & carrying about you the
remnants of sinne as shackles vpō
the feete of your soule to humble
you withall so long as you liue in
this world, performing these dueties,

you are discharged from the
sentence of eternall condemnatiō,
for the law of the Gospell is that
there shall be no condemnation
to them that are in Christ,Rom. 8. 1. which
walke not after the flesh, but after
the spirit. To which the godly
doe answere as the Apostle did in
the verie same case,Rom. 7. 25 I thanke my
God through Iesus Christ my
Lord. And thus much for the sentence
of the elect, now let vs heare
the sentence of the reprobate.The sentence of the reprobate.
            
            Call forth the reprobate man
of earth (saith the Lord.) Man of
earth what canst thou say for thy
selfe why sentence of eternall
death should not be pronounced
against thee? What, canst thou beleue
in Christ, & repēt for thy sins?
Yea Lord I beleeue that Christ
died for sinners, and for my part
I am sorie that I must be damned▪
Nay thou reprobate, canst thou

beleeue effectually that Christ died
for thy sinnes, and doest thou
abhorre thy sinnes which were the
cause of Christes death, or hast
thou any heartie desire so to doe?
for otherwise thou sayest no more
then the Deuils doe, who beleeue
and tremble. No Lord: I know
not what that meaneth. It is true in
deed, for whē thou wert admonished
to repent, thou hardenest thine
heart, abusing my patience, and
making a custome of sinne, which
hath bred full hardnes of heart,
and impenitencie in thee, and so
hast heaped vp vnto thy selfe
wrath against this day of wrath,Rom. 2. 5.
and reuealing of my righteous
iudgement: thou thoughtest also
that thou haddest faith and repentance at commandement, perswading
thy selfe and others that
all men may repent and beleeue if
they will, & whē they will, but now

thou seest that thou wert deceiued.
            Oh, a Psalme of mercy Lord, one
Psalme of mercy, I can read all the
Psalmes of Dauid, and say all the
penitentiall Psalmes by heart, I
will goe to Church, and say ouer
the Lords prayer, and my Pater
noster too, Lord I wil goe a pilgrimage,
and punish my bodie with
whipping, and fasting, I haue heard
thee preach in our parish Church,
and will doe againe when I can intend
it. Oh Lord I wil do any thing
rather then goe to hell. Ah thou
reprobate (saith the Lord) who
required all this at thy hands? doest
thou thinke to please me with thy
wil-worship, and spirituall whoredoms?
all that wil not serue thy turn
thy name is not writtē in the book
of life, therfore thou canst not repent,
nor beleeue aright: hast thou
no more to say? Yes Lord, Others
haue done as much as I▪ And I

hope to be saued as well as others▪
And I haue heard some say, that
thou art full of mercy, & wouldest
that all men should be saued. Yea▪
(saith the Lord) so hast thou and
many moe abused my mercy, & bereaued
me of iustice as much as in
you lie, & like ignorant, & vnstable
men peruerting my holy scriptures
to your owne destructiō,2. Pet. 3. 16 I wil haue
mercy on whom I will haue mercy
& I will execute iudgement merciles
vpon thee which shewedst
no mercy to the poore & fatherles,Iam. 2. 13.
& do thee no wrong. Therfore now
heare thy finall sentence, because
thou hast abused thy arme, that is,
the power, wealth, & authority that
I gaue thee, & hast not at any time
loued me for my mercy, nor feared
me for my iudgmēt, lo, therfore thy
arme shal be brokē, thou shalt be depriued
of all meanes wherby thou
hast bin encouraged to do mischief,

and then thou shalt be no more
cause of feare: my people shall goe
and liue without feare of thee. Also
thou shalt goe from hence to
the place from whence thou camest,Gen. 3. 19.
and that is to the earth: For
out of the Dust wert thou taken,
and to the dust shalt thou returne
againe. And from thence to the
place of execution in hell, and
there shalt thou hang in torments
intollerable, and perpetuall, prepared
for the Deuill and his Angels,
where shall be weeping and
wailing, aud gnashing of teeth for
euer. Thou shalt haue blacke
fame for thy herault, and euerlasting
shame for thy hearse, feare
and terrour shall be dealt for
thy doale, and the curses of the
poore shall follow thee to thy
graue. And this is briefely the
substance of the sentence of the
reprobate man of earth, which is

yet but a shadow of that which it
is indeed, for indeed it will be
more grieuous and terrible when
it commeth, then is possible for
all the tongues of men and Angels
to expresse. Now a little of
the execution of this sentence.
            In earthly iudgements, execution
doth not alwaies presently follow
the sentence of the iudge▪
for some are repriued vpon further
consideration,Of the executiō. some are after
a while committed to the gallies,
and perpetuall slauerie, some are
sodenly hanged vp, not knowing
of the time when, nor the place
where vntill the very instant. And
some haue knowledge both of the
time and place before hand, that
they may be prepared for death.
So is it also in this heauenly iudgement.
Some are repriued, and liue
long, yet still in the prison of sinne
and slauerie of the Deuill, which

is to encrease their torment, some
are sodenly taken, and speedily destroyed,
without recouerie being
brought by the righteous hand of
God into euil in the middest of the
Cōgregation as apeareth in Pro. 6.
15. Some are longer in languishing
paines & torments then some,
euen in this world for one and the
same fault.
            There be three causes for which
the Lord doth defer the ful executiō
of iudgement vpon the wicked,
the first is, to keepe thē in continuall
miserie, for all good things turne
to their euill, the second is to
plague them with their owne
sinne, for there cannot be a greater
mischiefe then to be a wicked
man, and to liue long in wickednes,
for when he hath serued the
deuill, the deuill shall pay him his
wages, and that sinne wherunto he
hath beene most enclined, and

whereof he looked for the greatest
pleasure and profite, shall worke
him the greatest plague and woe.
The third cause is, that they may
liue and punish vs which are the
children of GOD, who haue
beene alreadie crossed and whipped
by them, and are neuer the
better, but when he hath worne
them as rods to the stumpes vpon
the backes of his stubburne
children, and well humbled vs
by them, he will then cast his
rods into the fire. God punisheth
not as earthlie iudges
doe, to content them that
haue receiued the wrong, or to
satisfie the worlde, but because
he hateth sinne, and loueth
righteousnesse, and drawe
thereout greate glorie to himselfe,
and singular good to
his children. The vse of this

Doctrine may serue to terrifie the
wicked, who vse to make but a iest
of the iudgements of God, saying,
what? so long yet? till
doomes day? &c. but it is not so
lōg as they dreame, for the sentēce
of God is begunne many times to
be executed vpon the wicked, euen
when they least feele it, for it is
a iudgement of it selfe to be past
feeling of Gods iudgement when
they sinne: It serueth also to comfort
the godly, who thinke the
time long till the Lord take the
wicked in hand which do oppresse
and vexe them. Lastly let it serue
to admonish all of vs to looke vnto
our waies, and to liue so, as
that when God shall get vp vnto
his iudgement seat, we may be
found, in Christ our great suertie
vnblameable, and so escape the
fearefull and irrecouerable sentence

of the wicked and reprobate,
and on the other side may
receiue our quietus est, and discharge
with Gods elect in Christ
Iesus. To whom with the Father
and the holy Spirit, be all honour,
power, and dominion
for euermore.
            Now let vs praise God.
            Amen.
