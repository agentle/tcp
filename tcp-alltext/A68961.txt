                  ZAny finding in my ſelfe an immoderate care of thy poore ſoule, which like a fooliſh birde couets to flye into Hell ere her pinnions haue ſtrength to beare her from her necks breaking, and ſeeing thou deſiſteſt from bleſſing thy forehead with thy right hands croſſing, as if the ſigne of the Crucifix were a bug-beare to ſcarre away thy bleſſings, and that thou abiureſt the touche of holy water, forgetſt thy praiers, and haſt loſt the memorable vſe of thy Beads, which like the check of a clock kept time to thy tongues bable:

I would faine know ſince all the memorable: ſeruice of thy auntient diuinitie is forgotten, in what new diuell now of late thou repoſeſt thy new beleeuings.
            
            
               Zanie.
               My good Maiſter, my Tutor, or the fountaine from whence I haue begotten mine inſtruction, be not ignorant, that earlie in the morning after I haue religiouſlie cald vpon the great Creator of good cheere, and with infinite Aues ſaluted the crimſon virgin of the darke celler, and with the helpe of their two dieties, filled the emptineſſe of my ſeldome ſatiſfied belly: I then repoſe all my faith, build the groundworke of my hope, and plant the mightie mountaine of my charitie in the holy (O lie) league, conioyned with her happie Apoſtle, ſcorning to imitate the king-counterfaiting Hugonites, which beleeue onely in God and none other.
            
            
               Pantaloun.
               I pray thee my good diſciple, tell me what beaſt is that which thou calleſt the holy league, and what creatures are thoſe which thou baptiſeſt her Apoſtels?
            
            
               Zanie.
               What beaſt in the Deuils name? of my honeſty

Tutor I ſmile at the ſimpleneſſe of thy queſtion: why it is the beaſt of all beaſts: that which makes the beſt the moſt beaſtlieſt, and the moſt beaſtlieſt beſt in a beaſtly cenſure; it is the deſire of luſt, idleneſſe inuention, and the beſt bloome in ambitious ſpring: to wit, ſhe is a faire whore violated by adulterous princes, confeſt & abſolued by falſe Prieſts, and vncontionably bribde by ignorant people; as for her Apoſtles, they are as Pope Sextus a better ſpaniard than a Goſpeller, truer to the one, than religious to the other, though honeſt to neither: the father and the Sonne, without the Holy ghoſt, (for he like the vocatiue caſe, is wanting in all their ſubſtantiues) which is to be vnderſtood the father of Spaine, the ſonne of Sauoy, and inſteed of the Holy-ghoſt, the grand diuell of Loraine.
               
            
            
               Pantaloun.
               Recite to me then my good ſcholler, all the articles of thy Creede, grounded and made by thoſe Apoſtles, to the end that we may not onely heleeue, but the world may be wiſe in aſſured knowledge, that thou art become a great Doctor in the Spaniſh Macharon, or the diuels golden Legend.
            
            
               Zanie.
               Tutor I will: Firſt I beleeue in the moſt great, mightie, and ſaint murthering king of Spaine: the creator of the new land, as much of the arche dominator or ſuperintendant of the poore Hugonites,
                  
aſmuch of the Turkes great maiſter of France: as much as of England, Emperour or monarche: not fully ſo much of the world, as of the filthe and vncleanneſſe in the world: I beleeue in his ſonne and in his daughter, his children and their children: I beleeue in that great, faire, well cut, and better combed beard the Duke of Tienops and of Sauoy, who by his rare and vnſearcheable vertue, is aſcended vp into the ſigne Gemini, together with the infant, paſſing many times by the wanton horned ſigne Capricornus: I beleeue in the great Meſſias or Saluator the Duke of Parma, that he is dead, buried, and deſcended into hell: I beleeue in the great, groſſe, gray, and goodly head of the Duke De Mains which ſtands in more need of philoſophy, than beggars of almes: and to be briefe, for tediouſneſſe is laborſome, I beleeue in the holy church of Lorraine, aſmuch Apoſtolike as Chriſtian, and to neither of both any thing at all allyed.
            
            
               Pantaloun.
               Into how many articles is this Creede or ſymbole deuided, and which be they.
            
            
               Zanie.
               Into twelue, and theſe they are: Ambition, Enuy. Hypocriſie, Tyrannie, Slaunder, Flatterie, Treaſon, Sedition, Ignorance, Malice, Raſhneſſe, and Rebellion, and theſe my deare maiſter are the degrees or ladders ſteps, whereby all true catholiques muſt be

receiued into the church of the league or Spaniſh Synagogue.
            
            
               Pantaloun.
               But what is the intentiue meaning of theſe holy happy Apoſtles of the league, and what is the end of their ſo much admired excellencies.
            
            
               Zanie.
               The intention is moſt good, becauſe in the ſeeming procreation of their acts they immitate God himſelfe, foreuen as he created all things for his owne glorie, ſo bring they forth all their factions, for their owne triumphes, only this difference, his is admired and reuerenced of all ſoules, theirs wondered at and hated of all what euer hath feeling of chriſtianitie.
            
            
               Pantaloun.
               But how gallop they or poſt they forwarde in this ſo meritorious or bleſſed worke, or how ſweat they in the ferueneie of this holy action.
            
            
               Zanie.
               Euen ſo and in ſuch manner as the three Sages which Pilgrim-like trauaild from the Orient, faining to worſhip Chriſt, and plant him in too long forſaken France, bringing with them three preſents,

Warre, Peſtilence, and Famine, whilſt the Loade-ſtarre to their trauaile, is hypocriſie and preſumption.
            
            
               Pantaloun.
               But what fruite or profit ſhall redownd to this endleſſe webbe of their continuall working?
            
            
               Zanie.
               If they ſowe Iuorie, they ſhall reape thornes, if they beget a monſter, they ſhall bring forth a Chymera, if by their factious troubles they confound ſweetneſſe in the beginning, by the reſidence of their euill, they ſhall finde bitterneſſe in the ending.
            
            
               Pantaloun.
               How ſhall then my gallant pupill this thy holy league finde an end from the eternitie of her labor?
            
            
               Zanie.
               O my good maiſter, ſhe muſt firſt charitablie viſite her deare holy father Lucifer, and her mother Proſerpina, and all her worme eaten progenitors of Lorraine, for ſooner ſhall ſhe purchaſe a fee ſimple in any of their regions, than haue an eſtate for terme of life in the conſines of vnhappie France.
            
            FINIS.

            A nevv pleaſant and delightfull Aſtrologie, inuented by reuerend Maiſter Harlequin the royall Aſtrologer, calculated for the Leaguers Merydian.
            
            
               The firſt error is in the twelue ſignes.
               
                  THE Leaguers haue brought into Fraunce ſo manye rauenous Woolues, that the poore ſigne of Mutton is for euer baniſht their Zodiack, they haue inſtald ſo many Cod-peeces in their Cathedrals, that the pure ſigne of the Virgine is as rare to be ſeene, as thunder in winter, or a million of black Swans in a fiſhpond, and they haue made ſuch a tole-free open paſſage, vnto whole armies of diſordered

perſons that are boundleſſe in their villanie, that the ſigne of Lybra, or the equall poyſing ballance is caſſierd as vnprofitable amongſt them, but it is moſt true, and too true, that they haue eleuated in their Horrizon, and inſtald in triumphant credit, the great Taurus or bulbegger of Lorraine, with a multitude of Caprycornians and Sagitarians, which bend all their hornes and hooues againſt Burbon, but I may propheſie vnto them that they haue not found Saint Sebaſtian which patiently indured the Darts which were ſhot into him.
            
            
               
               The ſecond error is in the Planets.
               AGaine, theſe Leagwers ſhowe themſelues more Dogs than Doctors, that in ſtead of following the other Planets which acknowledge the Sunne as their common Prince, or principall ſubſtance of their borrowed ſplendor, yet will they that Mercury of Britaine, and Venus his wife, and all ſuch wandring ſtarres like themſelues, ſhall bend their borrowed bonfiers againſt the true ſonne of Fraunce, which notwithſtanding of his owne beneuolence▪ hath giuen them the little glimmering brightneſſe which they haue, and which is worſe than the worſte of all, after that they hauing loſt the true naturall heate of that glorious ſunne, they ſearche the coldeneſſe of the Satournian Spaniard, both froſtie in goodneſſe, dried by with couetouſneſſe, and as melanchollyas ambition can make him.
            
            
               
               The third error is in the Climates.
               NOw theſe Rabins or ſeemeing (though altogether vnſound) Doctors, pretending deepe inſight into Milſtone Aſtrologie, ſeeking to ſet fire vpon the houſe of Burbon, and ſtuffe her walles with ſtrange vermin or monſtrous creatures, haue whiſpered in the Spaniards eares like the downe-falling of a water to a thundring Myll, and with that ſecret prattle haue made him beleeue that Fraunce is colder than Spaine, and more temperate for the diuels dwelling: in ſuch ſort that the Spaniſh Marrans couetous of the pureſt ayre, bring their intemperance into our clymate, but they are mightily deceiued in the fooliſhneſſe of their opinions, for that often times and moſt commonly, thoſe which ſoiourne and dwell in their countrie of Spaine, notwithſtanding it is much whotter, yet doe they liue longer than they which come into Fraunce, Flaunders, or England.
               
            
            
               
               The fourth error is in the diſtinction of times.
               THeſe monſtrous lyers, the Serpents Schollers, make alſo the poore deceiued people of the League beleeue, that the times or ſeaſons are much differing one from the other, and that in ſome they muſt vſe purgations, in others coſticke medicines, and in ſome neither of both; as in the canicular, or dogge dayes: but if you will beleeue me (gentle readers) the fooles of Parris ſtand in no neede of purgations, neither yet of the new dyet, either by emptineſſe to eaſe their bellyes, or by ſpareneſſe of repaſt, to keepe their ſheetes cleanly: the Spaniards alſo for the moſt part, and principally thoſe which come into Fraunce, feare hell ten times more than the Dogge dayes. When they ſay that ſuch a ſeaſon ſhall be windie, ſuch a time raine, and ſuch a day faire pleaſant weather, all that ſerueth to nothing, or to no purpoſe, for the foole antidated before in mine Aſtrologie, which behoulding the conuerſion, feare neither winde, raine, nor faire weather, (God be thanked) for if they chaunce to be dabled a little with walking vp and downe the towne, the day ſhall come I hope, when they ſhall be duckt ouerhead and eares, or els vtterly drowned.
            
            
               
               The fifth error is in the Ecclypſes.
               THeſe logger-head learned Leaguers, make certaine diſtinctions of the Moone ecclipſed and not ecclipſed; but I that am not ignorant but know very well, that the Moone hath no power to gaze vpon the Sunnes forehead, nor to giue aime to his brightneſſe, holde this for a certaine actiome, that ſhe ſhall alwaies be ecclypſed, and that euery one of them cannot be but ecclipſed in true duties or indeuours, and walke in the darke like boyes at hood-man blinde; which is the cauſe that diuers of them doe fall, and if they ſcape breaking their necks, yet they looſe themſelues, altogether hopeleſſe for euer recouering one minute of day light, or any iotte of ſuccour at their great Meſſias the Duke of Parma.
               
            
            
               
               The ſixth error, is in the marks, or notes.
               THey propoſe and carrie before them the golden number, but yet in deſpight of all the promiſes of the huge King of Caſtile, I am aſſured that in the end the poore Paryſyans will finde it, but a beggars reckoning; it is very true, that the women ſhall haue two dominicall letters, ſo much the greater, by how much the greater they are inamoured with the greateſt Alphabet, to wit, great O. and great Q. And when you would know the yeare of the holy Barracados of Parris, or rather if you will the day when the Guyſards fighteth only with their balafte, you ſhall need but to make your honeſt repaire to me your aſſured friend Harlequin who knowes not onely the moouing of the elements, but the ſecret working of euery ſtarre in the heauens.
            
            
               
               The ſeauenth error is in the diſpoſition and courſe of the yeare.
               THeſe Leaguers make the yeares to  be twelue moneths, but the Parryſyans which haue watcht ſo many nights, and ſtood ſo many howers Sentinels on the walks, ſhall not be paide for ſixe moneths; they make ſixe daies in the week, alwaies baniſhing Sunday as an idle note in the Callender: but for Friday and Saturday, they are alwaies more villanouſlie ſharpeſet, and know farre worſſe tyrants in the Spaniſh armie than in the Kings regiment; they make the day foure and twentie howers in length, but the poore hungrie Parriſians that haue neither dinde, ſupt nor can get a breakefaſt, ſweare the clockes lye, for it cannot be leſſe then eight and fortie.
            
            
               
               The eighth error, is in the prediction of all that ſhall happen vnto the Leaguers from their conception, vntill their deſcending into Hell.
               THe godly and bleſſed Merdologians, or rather Fortune-tellers, make the Aſſe head abuſed Leaguers beleeue, that they are borne vnder the ſigne of the Lion, and ſo conſequently through that influence, they ſhall all prooue renowned warriours; but I diſcent from their iudgements, for I beleeue that they ſhall all rather be borne vnder the Crabbe, or demi Creuiſſe; learning to goe more backwarde than euer they wente forward, and for their education, they ſhall vndoubtedly be brought vpp vnder the ſigne of Aquarius, becauſe at their birthes Wine was baniſht for inflaming the liuer: and I holde it certaine in rules of their Natiuitie, that there ſhall be many Gramarians and Muſitians amongſt them, who ſhall decline ſo much, and diminiſh ſo mightily, that beggerie and ſcorne ſhall be all their companions, and in the end they ſhall dye vnder the Spaniſh Scorpion, if ſodainly before their times they be not annointed with the iuyce of Hempſeede, to mend their falling euils.
            
            
               
               The ninth error, is in the humor that ſhall rule amongſt them.
               NOw to giue them audatious bouldneſſe, and to incourage them in their fooliſh and damned raſh aduentures, theſe Aſtrologians do promiſe them, that the humor of Iupiter ſhall haue influence and rule in their natiuities, but I, euen I noble Harlequin, by the aforeſaid predictions, ſpeculations and coniectures, do conclude, that the melancholie humor ſhall be predominant and maiſter ouer them, which ſhall make them ſo phantaſticall and madde in their braines drunkenneſſe, that diuers of them ſhall dreame in the night, that they are already mounted vpon the deuils wings, into the third heauen, and when they awake, they ſhall finde themſelues accompanied with ſhame and diſcredite, the very monſters of the world, hauing no ſore but the earths barrenneſſe: others ſhall dreame of certaine priſes of Come and Wine, and forfeit the deare priſes of their ſoule, ſelling their bodies to hell & eternall damnation▪ others, (and of them ſhall be an infinite number) ſhall dreame that they are Kings, and princely Gouernours of Realmes and Principallities, but when they awake, they ſhall finde themſelues the thridbare gouernours, fathers, and nouriſhers of fleas, Lice, and all manner of fleſhly perſecuters.
            
            
               
               The tenth error is in the length of the Leaguers world.
               DIuiſion is the mother of deſtruction: and vnion the firſt bringer forth of conſeruation or proſperitie: whence it ſprings that the Aſtrologians belonging to the League, conclude in their vnion a perpetuitie, but I arguing both in forme and figure, prooue the flat contrarie, for ſay I, they ſhall be ſo vnited in will, that looke what the one would haue, the other would be glad to cut his throate ſo he might attaine it: and during the time of their diſputation, who ſhall firſt ſit downe and take the chiefe place at the table: I noble Harlequin a paſſing good Burbonian, will like an Vniuerſitie lurcher, licke all the fatte from their trenchers.
            
            FINIS.
            Beleeue as yee liſt.
