               And took hyr lorde and hyr loue for hyr euerlaſtyng ſpouſe of hys blyſfulle moder as ſhe deſyred / and bi helpe of that gloryous lady ſhe was coupled for euer to hyr dere ſone by a perpetuell vowe of virgynyte / as it ſhall be proued wyth the helpe of our lord by a clere token in the laſt chapytre of this fyrſt partye. But now ferthyrmore ye ſhall knowe that after thys vowe thys mayde began euery day to wexe more holy and holy.

But for all that ſhe purpoſed to take a waye from hyr fleſſhe all fleſſhly mete as moche as ſhe myghte. Wherfore whanne fleſſhe was leyde to hyr / as it fylle ofte / eyther ſhe leyde it to Stephen hyr brothyr or preuely lytyll and lytyll ſhe voyded it / that no body ſholde perceyue it.

Alſo a grete wele of othyr ſowles helthe began to be kyndelyd in hyr / and that was wonderfull in ſuche a chyldes herte / and ſyngulerly ſhe loued all tho ſayntes / whiche laboured ſpecyally a boute the helthe of mannes ſowle. She hadde alſo knowyng onely by the techynge of god that Saynt Domynyk ordeyned the ordre of frere prechours for loue of the feythe of holy chyrche / and for the helthe of mannes ſowle. Wherfore ſhe had that ordre in ſo moche reuerence / that whan ſhe ſawe frerys of that ordre paſſyng forth in the waye by hir faders how ſe / ſhe marked wel where they wente / and when they were paſſyd fulle mekely and deuoutely ſhe kyſſed the ſteppes of theyr fete. From that tyme forward / there wext a grete deſyre in hyr ſowle to go vnto that ordre that ſhe myght profyte man nes ſowle wyth other brethern of that ordre / but by cauſe ſhe ſawe a grete obſtacle in that ſhe was a woman. Therfore ſhe thought to folowe Saynt Eufroſyen as mē clepyd hir in childhode wōderfully as for a pronoſtycacion / that ryght as ſaynt Eufroſyen feyned hyr a man / and went in to a monaſtery of monkes / in the ſame manere thys mayde is purpoſed to ſeyne hyr a man / and go in to ferre contree where ſhe was not knowe / and take the abyte of the ordre of frere prechours / where ſhe myght helpe ſowles and ſaue them from peryſſhyng. But yet not wytfſtondyng that ſame thought and purpoſe abode longe in hyr mynde. Our lord ſuffred not that thought to be perfourmed in dedene brought to execucyon / for ye loue was put from hyr mynde to another ende / and our lord wolde alſo in another maner fulfyll hyr deſyre. In all thys tyme thys mayde wexte faſt in body and encreced in age / but moche more hyr ſowle encreced in vertue. Mekenes wext faſt / and deuocyon encreced / feyth was more clere / hope was gretely ſtrengthed. Charyte multyplyed hyr feruour. And of all thys vertues was gendryd a vertuous / and a worſhypfull ſadnes of maneres / and of relygyous putte in the ſyght of al men whyche conſydered hyr dedys. The fader and the moder were aſtonyed / her brethern and ſuſteren wondred gretely.
               
                  Alle the meyne of hyr faders hows meruaylled beholdyng and perceyuynge ſoo hygh wyſdome in ſoo tendyr age.
               And amonge many notable wyſe wordes and dedys / one I wylle ſhewe you here in cōmendacyon of that mayde. ¶ Hyt befylle at that tyme after ſeuen yere and to fore ten yere age that for deuocyon that hyr moder hadde to ſaynt Anthonye. She wolde haue a maſſe I ſayde in the worſhyppe of the ſame Saynt / wherefor ſhe clepyd Katheryne hir doughter and took hyr a certeyne of candelles and a certeyne of ſyluer and ſayde.
               Goo doughter to our paryſſhe chyrche and praye oure paryſſhe preeſt to ſyng or do ſynge a maſſe in the worſhyp of ſaynte Anthonye. And offer thyſe candelles and thys money vp to the awtre. ¶ Thys mayde was gladde to doo alle thynge that myght torne to the worſhyp of god / and anone ſhe wente to the chyrche and performed hyr moders byddyng
               But for deuocyon that ſhe hadde to here maſſe / ſhe abode ſtylle to the ende of the maſſe. And whan alle was I do / ſhe wente home ageyn / but hyr moder wende ſhe wolde a comen anone ageyn / anone as ſhe had made oblacyon to the preeſt ¶ And for as moche as her doughter taryed ſo longe after hir ſemyng. Whan ſhe ſawe that ſhe was come / ſhe thought to blame hyr doughter and ſayd. Curſyd be the wycked tōgues / that ſayd thou ſholdeſte nomore come ageyne. Thys was the manere of ſomme men to ſaye her langage to her name that taryed to longe out. Thys mayde thenne of grete wyſdome herde what hyr moder ſayde / and helde hyr ſtylle a whyle / and ſpake noo worde ageyne. But after a good ſpace thys mayde drewe hir modre a fyde / And wyth grete ſadnes of hyr mekely ſpak to hir modre and ſeyde ¶ A lady modre when euer I treſpas or do agaſt youre biddyng bete ye me wyth a rodde as you thynketh beſt that I be more ware Another time for it is worthy and ryght full that ye do ſo But no thyng I praye you for my defautes curſeth neuer good man ne badde / For it is not ſemyng for your degree And to me it is a full grete affliccion̄ in herte / while hyr modre herde theſe wordys ſche wondrid gretely And no merueill was to here her lytill doughter teche and ſo wyſely enforme hir In ſomoche that ſhe hadde no ſpirite more to blame hyr at that tyme for the wyſdom that ſhe ſawe in ſo yonge alitill thynge Neuer the les ſhe wolde not that hyr doughter hadde knowe that / therfor ſūwhat ſhe thoughte to ſpeke ageyne and turned to hir doughter and ſeyde / Why were you there ſo longe / the doughter ſeyde mekely ageyne modre I herde that maſſe that yebadde me goo to / And whan it was I doone I turned home ageyn wythout ony tarieng for I abode nowhere till I come home ageyne Thoo was the modre by tho wordis more edyfyed than ſhe was to fore and went to hyr huſbonde / & ſeyd Thus and thus hath thi yonge doughter I ſpoke / He than as a good man gafthankynges to god / and bare it ſtylle priuely in hys herte / And ſeyde noughte ageyne Loo ye mayden̄s that here or rede thys book of thys oo poynt all be yt that it be one of the leſte Yet mowe ye wele perceyue how our lorde encreceth hys grace all weye in thys yonge mayde till ſhe come to ye yeres of abilitee to be weddyd / of the whyche yeres ye ſhalle ſee in the next chapytre For of thys chapitre I make now an ende
               
                  ¶ But yet ye ſhall vnderſtonde that I had thyſe that be conteyned in thys chapytre of the ſame mayde for the more partye and ſomme I hadde of the modre and of other dwellyng in hyr fadres hows whyſe ſhe was of that age.
            
            
               ¶ How hyr feruente deuocyon was drawe whyche our lord ſuffred for encrece of more grace folowyng. And of hyr ſtronge pacyence wyth the whyche pacyens ſhe ſuffred in hir fadres hows many Iniuryes. Capitulūq̄rtū
               
               AFter the wonderfull and vertuous cours of lyuyng in the fyrſt yeres of thys maydens tender age / our lordes wyll was in ſomme lyghte defaute to ſuffre hyr to fall as he ſuffred fulle ofte ſomme of hys holy ſayntes / to that entent that they ſholde the more myghtely aryſe vp ageyne / and lyue more warly / and ſtrenght hem to atteyne to the ryght waye / and the heythe of perfeccyon and gloryouſly haue the vyctorye of the fende / whyche is euer enemye to mannes ſowle. ¶ Theſe wordes I ſaye here / for whanne ſhe came to the age of the yeres of abylyte to be wedded / that is to ſaye to the twelthe yere of hyr age or lytel more / thenne after the manere of the contree ſhe abode ſtyll at home and came not out of hyr fadres hows. And the fader and the moder thenne and hyr other frendes & kynne / by cauſe they knewe not the may dens purpoſe / they bethought hem and beſyed hem to ſeke aboute where that thys mayden myght worſhypfully and parfy tably be wedded and to what proſone.
               Hyr moder ſuppoſed that for the grete wyſdome that hyr doughter had / ſhe ſholde haue be wedded to ſomme man of grete kyneede / where for ſhe beſyed hir faſt aboute the bodely apparayll and araye of hyr doughter / and taught hyr to waſſhe ofte hyr face / and to kembe ofte hyr hede / and to make hyr fayre here / and to voyde alle thynge that ſholde be dyſhoneſte / or ſholde make foule hyr face or hyr necke / 
               That whan ony man came to aſke after hyr for maryage ſhe ſholde be the more ſemely and fayrer. Thys holy mayde was alle of another purpoſe and had made another vowe. Alle be it ſhe ſhewed it not to hyr fader ne moder / wherfor vtterly ſhe thoughte noo thynge to do as hyr moder bad hyr / touchyng ſuche curyoſyte. She beſyed wyth alle hyr ſtrengthes to pleſe god / but no man in that wyſe. And whanne hyr moder hadde aſpyed that ſhe had no wylle to that maner of lyuynge / ſhe was dyſpleſed / and clepyd to hyr Bonauenture hyr other doughter whyche was late I wedded before / And bad hyr trete ſoo hir ſuſter / that ſhe myght araye hyr in bodely apparayll as the manere was of wymen in that contre that ſholde be maryed / and doo as ſhe hadde bad hyr doo to fore. Hyr moder knewe welle that Katheryne loued Bonauenture fulle tenderly / and ſuppoſed that ſhe ſholde be broughte in to that more lyghtely by hyr ſuggeſtyons thanne by ony other. And ſoo ſhe was as ye ſhalle ſee after. For by ſuffraunce of oure lorde ſhe was broughte ſo Inne thorough ſpeche and example of hyr ſuſter Bonauenture by many maner wayes / that at the laſte ſhe aſſentyd to hyr beſyneſſe in apparaylle of hyr body / after the wylle of hyr moder / not wythſtondynge that ſtably ſhe kepte hyr purpoſe neuer to haue huſbonde. But after the graū
                  te to hyr ſuſtre and folowed hyr wylle / in ſuche araye / ſhe maad ſoo moche ſorowe whanne that ſhe was confeſſyd therof wyth terys and ſobbyng that

eche body ſhold ſuppoſe that ſhe hadde do ſomme greuous ſynne: She vſed ofte to be confeſſyd generally: and alway whā ſhe came to ye poynt ſhe accuſed her ſelfe full harde wyth wepyng & ſore ſobbyng But the confeſſour alle be it he knewe that a vertue it is of god: and lowely ſowles to ſee in them ſelf defaute where none is. And where it is but lytyll / it ſemeth hym full grete / Neuertheleſſe for aſmoche as ſhe accuſed her ſelf / and demed her worthy euerlaſtynge payne, for that ſynne / ſauyng the mercy of god / There he aſked her whether ſhe purpoſed or wylled in all that tyme to do agaynſt her vowe: She ſayde nay, for it came neuer in her herte. Alſo he aſked agayne whether ſhe dyde it to the pleſaunce of ony man. In ſpeciall: or to the pleſaunce of all men She anſwerd and ſayde: ther was none ſomoche payne to her as to be holde men or to be ſeyne of men / or to be there men ſhold fynde her / wherfore when her faders men yt lerned dyers crafte in her faders hous came to ony place or chambre where ſhe was. ſhe fledde as faſte awaye as adders hadde come to her ſoo that all men wondred / She wold neuer goo to the wyndowe ne to the dore of the hows to ſee how men wente by the waye / Then̄e he ſayd why deſerued ye that dede whiche was but for a bodely ornamente euerlaſtyng payne: namely whan the apparelle was not to exceſſyuely / She anſwerd and ſayde that to exceſſyuely ſhe loued her ſuſter / And as her thought more thā god as at that tyme wherfore ſhe wepte wythout remedye and dyd harde penaū
                  ce: Her confeſſour wold haue replyed agayne and ſayde Alle bee it ther was ſomme maner exceſſe of loue it was but lytyll: And that dede as of him ſelf was not I doo for noo wycked or euyl entencion / but for vayne pleſaunce of her for the tyme and that was not agaynſte the precepte of god / She herde how her confeſſour replyed / ſhe lyft vp her eyen to god / And wyth a lowde voys cryed and ſayde. A my lorde god what ghoſtely fader haue I nowe whiche excuſeth my ſynnes / and wyth a ſore grutchynge agaynſt her ſelf / ſhe tourned to her confeſſour and ſayde / Fader thynke ye that this wretchedfull and mooſte vnworthy creature of god whiche hath receyued of my maker of nought ſoo many gracyous yeftes wythout my labour / And wythouten ony meryte ſhold occupye ony tyme in arraye and vayne apparelle of this roten fleſſhe whiche myght or induce a dedely ſynne: I wene ſhe ſayde helle ſuffyſeth not to punyſſhe me: hadde not the pyte of god doo gracyouſly and mercyfull wyth me / 
               After thyſe wordes her confeſſour durſt nomore ſpeke of that mater / But than after that he beſyed him to knowe yf that bleſſyd ſowle had euer in her lyf be kept wythouten ony ſpot

                  e of dedely ſynne:
               Soo that ſhe hadde kepte fully hole her vyrgynyte both of body and of ſowle: Not only from the ſynne of fleſſhely ſteryng / but alſo of alle maner of ſynne ¶ And after that he knewe how vertuous and how clene a ſowle ſhe hadde / This wytneſſe and recorde he bare of her conuerſacion and both ſayd and wrote that he coude neuer perceyue ne fynde nother by her generall confeſſyon ne ſpeciall confeſſyon as ofte as euer ſhe was confeſſyd▪ And that was ryght ofte: that ſhe hadde offendyd agaynſt the precepte of our lorde: But yf it were that is tolde afore the whiche he myght not ſuppoſe it were agaynſte the byddynge of god / Ne he trowed none dyſcrete man wold ſuppoſe it / And alſo he ſayde that he founde her euer ſoo clene fro venyall

ſynnes that vnnethe he coude perceyue bi her cotydyan confeſſyon ony maner offē
                  ce: It was openly knowen not only to her confeſſours that knewe her conſcyence: but to all that were conuerſaunt▪ with her that neuer or ſeldon ſhe offended in worde: For eyther ſhe occupyed her tyme in prayer and contemplacion or ellis in good edyficacion of her neyghbours / And as for her tyme of ſlepyng / vnnethes ſhe wolde grauute to her a quarter of an houre And whan ſhe ſholde ete her mete▪ yet it may be called a mete. euer ſhe prayed and thought holy medytacyons thynkyng of the thynges that ſhe hadde lerned of our lord in her ſowle / More her confeſſyon: Mayſter Reymound bereth a trewe recorde of her for the tyme yt he knewe her and hadde cure of her conſcience / that it was more payne to her for to ete her mete, than it was to an hungry man for to be wythdrawe from hys mete. And a grete tourmente it was to her body after tyme ſhe hadde ete: than it was com̄ely to a fenerous man in rennyng offhis feuer / 
               And this was one of the cauſes why ſhe wolde ete her mete as it ſhall be declared wythin forthe for to tourmente and put in payne her body: In what maner of treſpaas myght ſuche a ſowle be occupyed: that alwaye was occupyed ſoo wyth our lord god / And yet not wythſtondyng ſuche good occupacions. She accuſed her ſelf ſoo ſharpely in confeſſion and ſoo wyttyngly put her ſelfe in treſpaas and offenſes / that yf hee cōfeſſour hadde not knowe her conuerſacyon: He myght haue ſuppoſed that ſhe hadde treſpaſed where ſhe treſpaſed not, but rather deſeruyd mede / 
               Loo ye maydens that heren and reden this boke: alle this proceſſe is for no thynge ellys I ſayde but by that ye perceyuen this lytyll defaute / In the whyche this holy mayde yelde her ſelf ſoo mekely gylty / 
               Ye maye vnderſtonde therby what per feccyon ſheweth therafter by the gracyous yefte of our lorde the whiche her confeſſour reherſeth in this wyſe. Bonauentura: ryght as ſhe was beſy afore for to araye this holy mayde as the worlde aſketh / Ryght ſoo eftſones ſhe beſyed her for to enduce her in ſuche araye by her counſeyll to the ſame apparaylle / 
               She myght in noo wyſe inclyne the may dens herte nother generall nother ſpecy all that ſhe ſholde ſhewe her bodely preſence wylfully to the ſyghte of man / to that entent oonly that ſhe ſholde be deſyred the ſoner to be wedded. all though her feruour of prayer: and of ſweteneſſe off medytaciō was ſlaked and wythdrewē from her for a tyme:
               Att the laſte oure lorde wolde not lenger ſuffre that hys ſpouſe the whiche had ſoo ſpecyally choſen ſholde be withdrawe and taryed from hys ſpeciall ſeruyce / he wythdrewe from her in this wyſe- In a tyme whan the ſame Bonauentura. the ſuſter of the holy mayde ſholde brynge forthe a chylde ſhe was yet yonge y: nough of age for to bere chyldren / Take hede maydens therfore and ſee by thys / How oure lorde is diſpleſed wyth theym that ben aboute for to lette and wythdrawe theym that wolde ſerue hym ſpecially in maydenhode and chaſtyte of lyuynge / 
               Thys Bonauentura as it is reherſyd after was alwaye full honeſte in her maner of lyuyng bothe in worde and dede / But by cauſe that ſhe beſyed her to drawe her ſuſter to wordly thynges the whiche deſyred to ſerue our lorde ſpecyally / She was ſmyten of hym and

punyſſhed wyth a full ſharpe deth Neuertheleſſe our lord yet wrought full mercyably wyth hyr / for as it was ſhewed afterward by reuelacyon to thys holy mayde / ſhe was in purgatory / and ſuffred many greuous paynes. And by the prayers of hir ſhe was delyuered of payne and reſtored to blyſſe / as ſhe ſhewed afterward preuely to hyr confeſſour. ¶ Whanne hyr ſuſter Bonauenture was paſſyd out of thys worlde / thanne thys bleſſyd mayde Katheryn clerely perceyued the vanyte of thys worlde / and be ganne more feruentely and more gredylye trewely for to be torned to the louely ghoſtly clyppyng of hyr endeles ſpouſe Jheſu cryſte / claymyng and accuſynge hyr ſelf gylty wyth Marye magdalene / fallyng doune full ſtreyte to the fete of oure lorde plenteuouſly ſhedyng out terys axynge Inwardly hys mercy / praynge and thynkyng vnceſſably for hyr ſynnes / that ſhe myght deſerue to hyr wyth Marye magdalene the wordes of confort of our lorde as he ſayde to Marye thus. ¶ Remittūtur tibi peccata tua. ¶ That is to ſaye / doughter thy ſynnes by foryeue the. And ſo ſhe beganne to haue a ſynguler affeccyon to Mary magdalene For thanne in that tyme ſhe enforſed hyrſelf wyth alle hyr myghtys to conferme hyr to Marye magdalene to haue the more grace in forgyuenes of hyr ſynnes.
               Therfore afterward by encrece of deuocyon thys folow therof that our lord god the ſpouſe of holy ſowles / and hys bleſſyd moder our lady Saynt Marye gaue Mary magdalene to thys blyſſyd mayde in to a mayſtreſſe and to a moder as it ſhall be declared more openly wyth Inne forth by the helpe of Jheſu.

A none myghtely and beſyly ſhe contynued in prayer and medytacyon and excercyſes of penaunce to haue grace to flee the conuerſacyon of men / and ſoo ſhewed by open tokenys to hyr frendes / that in noo wyſe ſhe was in purpoſe to be wedded to no dedely ne corruptyble ſpouſe. Syth it ſo is and was that ſhe had taken ſo gracyouſly to hyr ſpouſe in hir yonge tender age the vndedely kyng of endeles blyſſe
               Whanne the fader and moder & kynne perceyued veryly that thys holy may de ſhewed perſeueraūtly bothe by tokens and by worde / that ſhe wylled neuer to be wedded to none erthely man / they thought to bowe hyr herte / by a nother

               They callyd to them a frende of therys a frere prechour the whyche they loued ſpecyally / and prayed hym entyrly that he wolde goo and counſeyll that holy mayde that ſhe ſholde conſente to there wylle. To whome the frere anſwerde and ſayde / he wolde do that he myght. But whan he came to thys mayde by communycacyon he founde hyr ſo ſtedfaſt in the purpoſe of maydenhode that by conſcience he was ſo enduced to gyue hyr holſum counſeylle and ſayde. Syth it is ſo that thou arte dyſpoſed to ſerue our lorde god in maydenhede / ageynſt whyche purpoſe thy frendes ben aboute to lette the.

As ſoone as thys bleſſyd mayde herdethys hys counſeyll / ſhe wrought there after as though ſhe hadde I herde it of god. And took a peyre of ſherys anone and cutte awaye hir herys / in the whiche ſhe ſuppoſed ſhe had ſynned greuouſly / and that that ſhe hated ſo moche / ſhe cutte it awaye ryght gladly faſt by the he de / And whanne ſhe had I do / ſhe couerd hyr hede wyth a Coyf / and ſo wente forthe alle ageynſt the comyn cuſtome of other maydens of the worlde / wyth a kerchyf on hyr hede after ye doctryne of ſaynt Powle / And whan hyr moder Lapa aſpyed thys that hyr doughter Katheryn vſed thus to couer hyr hede cuſtomably / 
               She aſked hyr why ſhe dyd ſo / to who me thys mayden gaf none clere anſwer / by cauſe ſhe wolde nethyr lye ne telle the trouthe. Wyth that the moder wente to thys maydens hede and took of hyr kerchyfe wyth hyr owne hondys. And ſo ꝑceyued yt hyr here was cut awaey Thāne was the moder ſorowfull in hyr herte bycauſe hyr fayre here was cutte awaye waylynge and cryenge in thys wyſe.
               Aa doughter what haſte thou doo.
               Anone the mayde keuered hyr hede efte ſones / and wente a ſyde To the crye of her moder came bothe the fader and the chyldren meruayllyng what it myght be

But yet to thys mayden our lord gaff the vyctorye / that thoo thynges whyche ſemed lettyng to hyr holy purpoſe was to hyr grete helpe meruayllouſly for to knytte hyr to our lord more myghtely Therefore they purſued hyr openly rebukyng hyr and thretyng hyr in worde and dede ſayeng thus. Thou wretched creature troweſt thou for to eſcape thus that thou ſhalt not fulfyll our wylle becauſe that thou haſt cutte awaye thyn here / hyt ſhall growe ageyn wyll thou nyll thou / and though thyn herte ſholde to breſte / yet ſhalt yu haue an huſbonde. And thou ſhalt neuer haue reſte vnto the tyme that thou haſte conſented to our wylle.
               And wyth that they made an ordynaunce that Katheryne ſhold nomore haue no pryue chambre by hir ſelf to dwelle Inne / but that ſholde openly be occupyed in the comyn ſeruyce of the hows.

In this bleſſyd lord / thys holy mayde Katheryn truſtyd ſo hyghely that ſhe made hir wyth Inne hyr ſelf a chambre by hys helpe / for whos loue ſhe charged not for to leſe the chambre made of mannes handes wythout forth. ¶ But now one thynge ſhall I ſaye / that mayſter Reymond the confeſ ſour of thys holy mayde beryth recorde of that whan that he ſholde walke outward by cauſe other whyle of grete outward beſyneſſe and occupacyon that nedys muſt be done: Thys holy mayde oftymes warned hym and ſayde / that he ſhold make wythin hys ſowle a pryuee celle / of whyche pryue cell he ſholde neuer goo out
               And alle be it that he vnderſtonde hyr not / but ſo ouerly ſo lyghtely. Yet neuertheleſſe afterwarde whan he conſydered more wyttely hyr wordes. The wordes that Saynt Johan ſayde in the Goſpell felle in hys mynde where it is reherſed of cryſtys dyſcyples in thys wyſe. Hoe autem non cognouerunt diſcipuli eius primum. Sed quando glorificatus eſt iheſus tune recordatiſunt. That is cryſtys dyſcyples knewe not alle thynge of hym as touchyng hys paſſyon fyrſt but onely. But after tyme whan he was reyſen fro deth to lyue / and gloryfyed / thanne they knewe more openly and clerely / And ſoo in the ſame manere wyſe / bothe to mayſter Reymond hyr confeſ ſour & to tho other that were conuerſaunt

wyth hyr / it happyd meruayllouſly that they perceyued more openly and clerely bothe her dedys and hyr wordes afterwarde / than whenne they were wyth hyr preſently / 
               ¶ Yette ſhall I telle you of another holy conſeyt and a bleſſyd ymagynacyon of thys holy mayde / that the holy ghooſt taught hyr / by the whyche ſhe ouercome alle wronges and deſpytes as ſhe tolde pryuely to hyr confeſſour / axyng of hym mekely how ſhe myght be perfytly gladde amonge ſoo many deſpytes / And thanne ſhe brake out and ſayde / that ſhe hadde ſuche an ymagynacyon in hyr ſelf that hyr fader repreſented our lorde Iheſu Cryſte oure ſauyour and hyr moder oure bleſſyd lady Saynt Marye And hyr brethern and other many of the houſholde betokeneth the holy appoſtles of oure lorde and other dyſcyples of hys.
               And for thys bleſſyd ymagynacyon ſhe ſerued hem alle the more gladdely / ſoo that they were alle a meruaylled therof.
               And by thys bleſſyd ymagynacyon ſhe wan another grete profyte / and as oftr as ſhe ſerued and made mynyſtracy on / euer ſhe hadde in mynde hyr hyr ſpouſe Iheſu Cryſte. Whome hyr thought ſhe ſerued. And ſoo ſhe beyng in bodely kechyn was alle waye wyth that holy place that is callyd Sancta ſancto
                     
                        
                     
                     rum
                  . And as ofte as ſhe ſerued atte mete / ſoo ofte ſhe fedde hyr ſowle wyth the preſence of oure ſauyour. A hyghe and rycheſſe of endeles counſeyll / by how many dyuers and meruayllous wayes delyuereſt them that truſten in the from alle maner dyſeſes / and bryngeſt them in to the hauen of endeles reſte / delyueryng them bothe from the pytte and the ſwolowe.
               Whan alle thys was done / thys holy mayde conſyderynge euyr more in hyr ſowle ye mede & the rewarde I ordeyned for hyr of the holy ghooſt / ſuffred gladly and nought paynfully / alle the wronges that was putte to hyr. And alſo ſhe encreced contynually the cours of hyr labour the more / that ſhe myght haue a full ioye in hyr ſowle. And by cauſe that it was not ſuffred to hyr to haue a chambre by hyr ſelf / but for to haue hyr chambre openly as other hadde.
               ¶ Therefore by an holy a

                  uyſement / ſhe choſe the chambre of Stephen hyr brother that hadde nether wyf ne chyldren. Where by dayes tyme whanne he was abſente ſhe myght be allone. And nyghtes tyme whan he ſlepte / ſhe prayed after hyr deſyre / ſoo that nyght and daye ſhe ſoughte to ſee the face of hyr ſpouſe Iheſu Cryſte / knockyng at the dore of hys ghooſ
                     •
                  ly tabernacle wyth out ceſſyng. She prayed our lord vnceſſably that he wolde wouche ſauf to be the keper of hyr virgynytee / ſayeng and ſyngyng in in ſowle wyth Saynt Cecylye thys holy verſe of Dauyd the prophete Fiat cor meum domine et corpus meum immaculatum. That is lorde Iheſu I praye that myn herte and my body be kepte clene vnderfowled to the / and ſoo in ſcylence and in hope ſhe was made ſtronge in our lord ryght meruayllouſly. For the more torment and perſecucyon ſhe hadde wyth out forth / the more ſhe was fulfylled wyth ghooſtly ioyes wythin forth / ſoo ferforth that hyr brethern perceyueng hir ſtedfaſtneſſe ſayden betwyne them ſeluen thus we be ouer come. Hyr fader that was moſt Innocente of alle conſyderyng pryuely hyr dedes / perceyued that ſhe was ladde euery daye more and more by the holy ghooſt / and nought by the lyghtnes of yonthe.
               Alle thyſe that ben reherſed in thys chapytre / hyr confeſſour mayſter Reymond

had it by reuelacyon of Lapa thys maydens moder / and of lyxa her brother wyf and of other alſo that were in hyr faders hows / But as for other thynges that other folke myght not knowe / he knewe by tellyng of thys holy mayde in confeſſyon / 
            
            
               ¶ Of the vyctorye whyche ſhe hadde of them that deſeſed hyr / And that was by a culuer whiche hyr fader ſawe / and by a vyſyon of S

                  ynt Domynyk Ca v
               IN the mene whyle that thys holy mayde was putte in ſuche reproue and ſhame / it happyd vp on a daye that ſhe entred in to the chambre of hyr yonge brother Stephen. And prayed deuoutly leuyng the dore vnſhett for it was forboden to hyr by hyr fader & moder that ſhe ſholde not ſhette the dore.
               Caſuelly thenne it happened that the fader entred in to the chambre ſekynge a certeyne thynge of hys ſones that he had nede to. And as he loked aboute / he ſawe hys doughter more goddes doughter thanne hys / prayng in a corner and knelyng / and a lytell whyte culuer reſtynge vp on hyr hede / the whyche culuer fledde out of the chambre wyndowe whan the fader was entred in to the chābre as him thought Anone the fader axed the doughter / what culuer that myght be that fledde ſo out of the chambre / to whom the doughter anſwerd and ſayde / that neuer ſhe ſawe culuer ne other byrde in the chambre. Thenne hadde the fader grete meruaylle / and kepte all thyſe wordes pryuely in hys herte. Fro that tyme forwarde there beganne gracyouſly to encrece in that holy maydens ſowle an holy deſyre / whyche neuertheleſſe was begonne as it is reherced a fore in hyr chyldehode / and now afterward it was renewyd for tuycyon and dyſeaſe of kepyng of hyr maydenhode or virgynytee / and that deſyre was no thynge ellys but for to receyue the habyte of the ordre of frere prechours the whyche ordre Saynt Domynyk was bothe foundour and fader. There ſhe prayed bothe daye and nyght to our lord that he woucheſauf to fulfyll hyr deſyre.
               And therto ſhe had a grete deuocyon to Saynt Domynyk / as it is reherſed a fore to a worthy and a fruytfull louer of ſowles. Almyghty god therefor ſawe how wyſely and how myghtely hys doughter as a yong knyght faught in batayll / and wyth what feruour of deuocyon ſhe beſyed hyr to pleſe hym wyth alle hyr deſyre / he wolde in no wyſe dyſceyue hyr ne defraude hyr of hyr holy purpoſe.
               But for the more ſekerneſſe he comforted hyr wyth ſuche a vyſyon.
               ¶ This holy mayde on a tyme had a vyſyon in hir ſlepe that ſhe ſawe many holy faders / & many dyuers foūdours of ye ordre of ye frere prechours / amonges whom ſhe ſaw ſaynt Dominyk that ſhe knewe wel I now / holdyng in hys honde a fayre whyte lylye / the whyche lylye ſemyng to hir was all a fyre as ye buſſhe yt Moyſes ſaw / & yet was not brennyd. Whan this holy faders al in general & eche in a ſpeciall gaf hir coūſeyll for hir more mede yt ſhe ſhold cheſe oo Relygion of their ordynaūce in ye whiche relygion ſhe myght yelde due ſeruyce to god. She torned hir ſelf hole to ſaynt dominik / & ſo ſaw in ſpyryt how yt ye holy fader ſaynt dominyk came to hir & brought in his honde an habyte of ſuſtriſ the whyche ſuſters ben called ſuſtres of penaunce of ſaynt Domynyk Of ye whiche ſuſters ther was ne yet is no lytell nōbre in ye cyte of Senee. And whan thys holy fader ſaynt domynyk cam to this mayde he cōforted hir with ſuche wordes & ſayde Dought be of good cōfort / & drede no manere of peryll for ryght as yu haſt deſyred

this habyte: ſhe thought ſhe receyued it and thankyd almyghty god and his worthy confeſſour Saynt Domynyke not wyth a lytyll gladneſſe but wyth ioyefull teres that ſoo perfyghtely hadde cō
                  forted her: And ſoo wyth wepyng ſhe awoke & was reſtoryd to her bodely wyttes.
               ¶ And whan ſhe was awaked ſhe caught comforte and bodely ſtrength of this vyſyon / and toke ſoo grete a boldenes of the truſte that ſhe hadde in our lorde / that the ſame daye ſhe called her fader and moder and bretheren togyders and ſayde to theym boldely in this wyſe / Somtyme ye ſayde vnto me / and tretyd me longe tyme therof that I ſholde bee wedded to a corruptyble and to a dedely man & though I hadde abhomynacion of ſuche weddyng in myn herte as ye myght clerly perceyue by many dyuerſe tokenes if ye hadde I wolde yet for the reuerence that I ſholde ſhewe to my fader and moder by the bydyng of god vnto this tyme I excuſed me neuer clerly to you / but now by cauſe I may noo lenger be ſtyl I ſhall declare to you openly myn herte and purpoos / The whiche purpoos it is not conceyued of newe: but of chyldhode vnto this tyme▪ therfore I wyl ye knowe it that in myn chyldhode I made avowe of virgynyte and ſerue oure lorde ſauyour of alle the worlde / and his bleſſyd moder gloryous vyrgyn marie. our gloryous lady / not chyldely but wyth a ſa

                   and a longe avyſement. And for a grete cauſe / I made avowe alſo that I ſhold neuer take huſbond but hym alone: Therfore now ſyth I am come by the ſufferaunce of oure lord to a more perfyght age and knowleche and vnderſton dyng wytte / wete ye ryght well this is the ſame purpoos whiche is ſoo myghty and ſtroonge in myn ſowle that it were more poſſyble hard flynt ſtones rather to be made neſſhed. than myn herte ſhold be wythdrawe fro this holy pnrpos and therfore the more ye laboure aboute thys thynge / the more tyme ye leſe: Wherfore I counſeyll you that ye leue of alle maner ſuche tretyng of weddynge as touchyng myn perſone / For therin ſhall I neuer fulfylle your wyll / by cauſe that I ſholde rather be obedyent to god than to man / therfore yf ye wylle haue me ſuche one in your hous that I now ſerue god in this purpoos and for to be a commyn ſeruaunt to ſerue you all / I am redy in all that I can or may to doo you ſeruyce gladly: And yf ye wylle receyue me but for this cauſe that ye wylle putt me out of your hous / I doo you well to wete that in noo wyſe myn herte may be wythdrawe fro this holy purpos / 
               ¶ I haue an huſbond and a ſpouſe cryſte Jheſu ſoo rychely and ſoo myghtely yt wyll not ſuffre me in noo wyſe to lacke no thyng / But he wyll mynyſtre to me all that me nedeth:
               Whan ſhe hadde ſayde alle thyſe wordes alle that herde her ſpeke fyll in wepyng / and by cauſe of her plentnouſly ſyghynge and ſobbynge / they myght for that time gyue none anſwer: They conſyderid to the holy purpos of thys holy mayde ye whyche they myght not wyth ſaye ne wythſtonde: & they behylde alſo how ſtyll the mayden had I kepte her: how clene & how pure vnto yt tyme / & how bodely ſhe declared her conſciens by wordes of grete prudence / & alſo ouer more they ſawe openli that ſhe was rather dipoſed for to forſake her faders hous than for to breke her holy purpoos and ſoo they hadde nomore truſte of her weddyng / wherfore it lyked theym better for to wepe than for to gyue her anſwer / 
               Wythin a lytyll whyle after whan they

hadde ceſyd all her wepynge: the fader yt loued her ſoo tenderly had dredde of god and dred god / ſoo hyghely hadde mynde of the coluer that he ſawe and of many good dedes of the whiche ſhe vſed / The whiche dedes he gretely merueylyng gaue her ſuche an anſwere and ſayde / Dere doughter god forbede it that we ſholde ony thynge wylle or deſyre agaynſte the wyll of god. For the whiche wyll / and fro the whiche wyll we knowe well thys holy purpoos cometh fro / Therefore it is ſoo that we ben taught by longe experyence. And now openly we ſee that thou art not ſteryd herto by the lyghteneſſe of chyldhode: but by feruent charyte of god / Make thy vowe therfore frely / and doo as the lyketh and as the holy ghooſt techeth the:
               ¶ And fro this tyme forward we ſhall neuer lette the from thyn holy purpoosne thyne ghoſtely excerciſe / but only praye for vs beſely that we maye bee made worthy to the promys and the byheſte of thyn ghooſtely ſpouſe whom thou haſte choſe by his ſpecyall grace in thyn tender age: ¶ Thenne he tourned hym to hys wyf and to his chyldren and ſayde none of you from this tyme forward be to my ne dere donghter greuous. None be ſoo hardy from this tyme forward to let her in ony wyſe to ſuffer her to ſerue her ſpouſe freely / and ſhe to praye for vs be ſely / 
               We myght neuer haue founde a better huſbond to her thenne he is. the whiche vocheſauf to be ſo nere of our kynde for to wedde our doughter and haue her to wyf / Therfore we haue none cauſe to pfayne vs ſythe it ſoo is that we haue receyued now for a dedely man▪ vndedely god and man to be her ſpouſe / 
               ¶ Whan the fader hadde ſayde thyſe wordes wyth wepynge and wyth weylyng bothe of theym, ſelfe and alſo of other that herde theym and hym ſpeke and namely of ye moder that louyd this mayde in maner fleſſhely. then̄e this holy maide Katheryn ioyefully thanked oure lorde that brought her to this vyctorye and alſo her fader and moder wyth alle maner of lowenes: dyſpoſyng her ſelf to vſe profytably the lycence that was graū

But he knewe it by reuelaciō of Coſyns that dwellyd in the faders hous. the whiche coſins recorded and bare wytnes that the fader ſawe ſuche a culuer wyth her ofte tymes And therfore he hadde her in greate reuerence. and he wold in noo wyſe that ſhe hadde be lettyd or troublyd / 
               ¶ Of the vyſyon that ſhe ſawe of ſaynt Domynyk bothe mayſter Reymound & her confeſſour afore hym knewe it by tellyng of this holy mayde. And whan mayſter Reymound examyned her of ye wordes that ſhe ſayde laſte to her fader moder and brederen: and how ſhe byhad her in her peſecucions: ſhe tolde hym alle by ordre mekely as it was /

               WHan this deuoute mayde hadde receyued ſo large a lycence that was graunted her of longe tyme deſyred afore / She beganne

ryght quyckely for to dyſpoſe merueylouſly alle her lyf to the ſeruyſe of god: ¶ Att the begynnyng ſhe aſked to haue a lytyll chambre to her ſelf / and ſo had de it: wherin ſhe purpoſed to tourmente her body wyth penaunce as in a wylderneſſe that ſhe myght haue the more fredome of ſowle for to ſerue our lord / How moche and how harde penaunce ſhe vſed in tourmentyng of her body / And how grete loue ſhe hadde in ſeyng of hyr ſpouſe in that lytyll chambre: there maye noo tongue ſuffre to telle / Neuertheles I haue reherſed ſom what in generall of her grete penaunce / And now I purpoſe to telle you maydens in ſpeciall vnder fewe wordes the hardneſſe of her penaunce / ſoo that ye of the grete vertuous herbes of her holy lyuyng maye taſte ſomwhat of the fruyte that growen aboute the herber bothe of the fyrſt and of the laſte / And for the condycions and the kyndis of the fruyt: it ſhall be declared by the helpe of god afterward And the cauſe why that in this place is reherſyd ſom̄e what of her fruyte full vertuous lyuing is for nothynge ellys / But for the maydens ſholde be the more able and redyer to ghoſtely excercyſe: In this lytyll chā
                  bre that was graunted her: ofte tymes ſhe conſydered ſwetely the ghoſtely werkis of our old faders of Egypte. And in ghoſtely werkys was to her ſoo moche the more merueylous, and that ſhe hadde the trewe knowleche therof in her faders hous wythout enſample or doctryne off other / Fyrſt I ſhall telle you of her abſtinence of mete and drynke fro her chyldehood in to the tyme that ſhe came to that age / She ete full ſeldom fleſſhe as it is reherſed afore / but whan ſhe was come to this age and this ſpeciall fredom. ſhe forſoke vtterly etyng of fleſſhe ſoo fer forthe that belonge of cuſtome and vſe that ſhe hadde in forſakyng of it:
               It was ſo lyght ſome to her that it was a payne to her for to ſmelle it as ſhe told her confeſſour preuely in confeſſyon and by cauſe ye ſhold haue none gretter merueylle herof. I ſhall telle you of another grete abſtynence / Whan her confeſſonr perceyued in a tyme that ſhe was gretly waſted and feblyd in body for ſhe receyued none ſuche mete and drynke that febyll folke ſholde be comforted wyth / He gaue her counſeyll that ſhe ſholde putte in her colde water that ſhe dranke / ſuger or a lytyl ſuger roſet: Wherby her ſpyrytys myght the more be quyckenyd / Wyth that ſhe touenyd to her confeſſour and ſayde / A lytyll lyf there is left wytt in me the whiche me ſemeth ye wolde it vtterly were quenchyd / 
               And whan her confeſſour hadde aſkyd her why and knewe her excuſacion / He vnderſtode by her wordes that ſhe hadde ſoo vſed her to bytter metes and vnſauory drinkys. that all maner ſwete thyng was noyous to her body / by cauſe her dyſpoſycion was tourned in to a cuſtome: And ſoo it was to her of etyng f
                     •
                  eſſhe. as it is reherſed afore: And whan ſhe ſholde drynke wyne as the contree foryeuyd after the tyme ſhe hadde lycence to kepe her chambre: ſhe medlyd that wyne ſoo wyth water that it loſte both his taſte and his ſauour / and alſo a grete parte of his colour / But afterward whan ſhe was xv yere of age ſhe lefte alle maner of drynkyng of wyne and vſed to drynke colde water: And all maner ſoden mete out taken brede alone / She wythdrewe fro her by lytyll and lytyll euery daye ſomwhat / and wythin a lytyl tyme after ſhe helde her to brede and rawe herbes / 
               ¶ Att the laſie whan ſhe was twenty

yere of age or there aboute. ſhe lefte etyng of brede and helde her only to rawe herbes: Thenne afterward ſhe came to ſuche an hyghe ſtate of lyuyng. nonght by vſe and kynde as it ſhall be declared openly ynogh wythinforth by the helpe of god / But oonly by myracle that alle be it: her body was oppreſſyd gretely wyth many dyuerſe ſekeneſſe and grete traueylles: The kyndly of dygeſtyon in the body hadde noo place in her: and the ſtomake alſo vſed not the myght and the vſe of his offyce of defyeng:
               And yet the ſtrengthes of the body notwythſtondyng her ſtrengthe lyuyng both in mete and drynke were neuer the febly er: ſoo that than her confeſſour recordeth of her / alle her lyf was myracle. She myght neuer doo that ſhe dede by ſtrengthe of kynde as phyſyens ſayd and tolde afterward to her confeſſour: but oonly by myracle.
               All thyſe thynges ſhall clerely and play nely by the helpe of god openly be declared wythin this boke afterward. But as for the concluſyon of her abſtynence fro the tyme that her confeſſour Mayſter Reymound knewe her as he recordeth of her is this that ſhe lyued not wyth no mete ne drynke that was nouryſſhynge to her. ne ſhe hadde none comforte of none kyndely ſtrengthe: And yet neuertheles ſhe ſuffred gladly all maner dyſeſes and laboures: How came ſhe to this ſtate of lyuynge trowe ye trewely not by bodely excercyſe and vſe. But rather by fulnes of ye ſpirite I ſhall tel you in what wiſe ye fulnes off ye ſpirite ſom̄e tyme rebonudeth in to the body. there it is made ſubiecte & acordyng to the werkys of the ſpyryte for there the ſpiryte of a goſtely creature is fedde wyth the gyftes of goſtely graces / the body ſuffreth the more pacientli aboue naturall ſtrengthe of his own nedes: who wold be in dobute herof I trowe none reſonable creature / whether martyrs in her holy martyrdome ſuffred not gladly aboue naturall ſtrengthe tormente and myſerye of theyr bodyes in her paſſyons / I trowe yeis / 
               And fro whens cometh this trowe ye / but of fulneſſe of the ſpyryte / This is ofte tymes knowen by experyens in oure dayes: that yf a man or a womman be occupyed in goddes ſeruyce deuoutly / 
               He reketh neuer how longe he faſteth and neuer to ſpeke wyth creature / but whan he ceſeth of the ſpeciall deuocion / And is occupyed in outward bodely beſynes / it is harde for hym for to faſte & doo as he dyde before / Whens cometh this grace / but oonly of the fulnes of the ſpyryte that conforteth the body: the whiche accordeth to the werkis of it / & alle be it that this is a gyfte aboue nature yet naturally the ſpyryte otherwhyle communeth wyth the body: And the body wyth the ſpyryte bothe in good and euyl In thyſe wordes I denye not / but that ther ben ſomme the whiche maye faſte more eſely than ſomme. But ſymply for to faſte and abſteyne longe tyme togyder in this lyf / me ſemeth it is inpoſſyble bi nature thus moche is reherſed of her grete abſtynence for this tyme / Takyth hede alſo of another thynge that this holy mayde tourmentyd her body wyth: beſyde all her abſtinence / She made to her a bedde al of bordes wythout ony other ſtuff: otherwhyles ſhe wolde ſytte or ſtonde in holy medytacions & other whyle knele & praye: & alwaye whan ſhe wolde ſlepe ſhe laye coun wythout ony doyng awaye off her weryng clothes. For ſhe weryd alwaye wollen bothe nexte her body and wythout ſome tyme ſhe vſed the hayre or the cilyce, and yt ſhe lefte afterward by cauſe as her confeſſour ſuppoſed / That

ſhe that was clene wythin eſchewed vnclen̄es wythout that is engendred of the cilyce or of the hayre / But for the hayre ſhe vſed an yron chayne next her body euyr ſyttyng faſte to her ſydes wythoute ony remeuynct or eaſe / vnto the tyme it endented the ſkynne / And made a marke ther vpon as it hadde be forbrennyd: As her ghoſtely doughters and her felawes tolde after ward to Mayſter Reymond her confeſſour / the whiche ghoſtely doughters and felawes ofte tymes for dyuerſe ſekeneſſes that ſhe ſuffred conſtreyned her for to chaunge / her clothes and for to waſſhe awaye the ſwete.
               And therfore her confeſſour afterward by cauſe of her grete ſekeneſſe that ſhe ſuffred a lytyl before that ſhe ſholde be deed conſtreyned her by obedyens that ſhe ſholde leue her cheyne. All be it ſhe wolde not doo it by hyr good wyll.
               Euermore ſhe contynued in wakyng tyl the daye dawed on the morowe as it ſhall be declared more opynly here afterward. After that by lytyll and lytyll our lorde gaue her grace to ouercome ſlepe / that vnnethe ſhe wold ſlepe half an houre in two dayes: And vnnethys ſhe wolde receyue that half houre but as ſekenes couſtreyned her therto /

               ¶ Doctours of holy chyrche whome I haue taught the trouthe ſeyn / and ſoothe it is / that myn vyſyon begynneth wyth a drede but euer in the paſſyng it ſetteth a ſowle in greate reſte and ſekernes / It begyn̄eth wyth a maner of bytternes But euermore more and more it wexith ſwete / And the contrarye herte dothe the vyſyon of the fende: It gyueth in the begynnyng as it ſemeth a maner of gladdenes or ſykenes / or ellys ſweteneſſe / But whan it paſſeth awaye / euer it encreſeth in the ſowle dred and bytterneſſe This is the treweſt knowleche for to knowe myn wayes from the fendes wayes
               ¶ The waye of penaūce and the kepynge of myn preceptys and commaundementes in the begynnyng it ſemeth harde and ſharpe / But the more a ſowle

prouffyteth in kepyng of theym: the more eſely it waxith ¶ The waye of ſynne in the begynnyng ſemeth full delectable but euer in encres therof a ſowle is made more and more dampnable / 
               ¶ But yet ſhall I gyue the another token for to knowe myn vyſyon from the vyſyon of the fende / Vnderſtonde this for a ſothe / that ſythe it ſoo is that I am trouthe euer of myn vyſyons the ſowle of man receyueth a greate knowleche of trouthe: and by cauſe that the knowleche of trouthe is full neceſſarye to the ſoule as well to her ſelf as to me that ſhe may knowe me & her ſelf / of the whiche knowleche ſhe paſſeth out fro her ſelf in ſettinge lytyll by her ſelfe and honoureth and worſhyppeth me / The whiche condycion properly is called the condycions of mekenes. Therfore it were full nedefull that a ſowle ſholde thus knowe her ſelf / And ſoo be made meke by vyſyon.
               The contrarye is of the vyſyon of the fē
                  de. ſythe it ſo is that the fende is fader of leſynge and kynge of all the chyldren of pryde / And he may not gyue but that / that he hathe as his leſyng and pryde. Therfore as of his viſyō / a ſoule ſemeth moche by her ſelf and is made glad and 
                     〈…〉
                   Joye / The whiche is properly the condycion of pryde: and ſo ſhe is by lefte ſwellyng and bolnyng in pryde: Then̄e therfore yf thou examyne and dyſcuſſe dylygently in thy ſelf: mayſte knowe whether vyſyon come to the of trouthe or ellys of falſeneſſe / yf it come of trouthe: it maketh thyn ſowle meke / yf it come of falſenes & by deſceyte: it maketh thyn ſowle proude.
               ¶ Thenne this hooly mayde whan ſhe hadde herde thys / ſhe kepte this holſome doctryne full dylygently in her ſowle and tolde it afterward to her confeſſour and alſo to other for her edyfycacion as it ſhall be reherſyd wythinforthe by the helpe of god. And thenne began our lorde to ſhewed this holy mayde viſyons & reuelacyons plentuouſly: ſoo ferforth yt vnnethe myght be founde two men ſo homely in conuerſacion to gyders: as oure lorde Jheſu and ſhe were to gyders / 
               For whether ſhe prayed or redde or had medytacions or walked or ſlepte o wyſe or other: ſhe was comforted many times whan ſhe ſpake wyth other ſhe hadde reuelacions or vyſyons and ſpake in her ſowle to our lord whyles her tongue ſpake outward to other / But that myghte not longe contynue for her ſowle was ſo wonderly I drawe vp to her ſpouſe Jheſu that wythin a lytyll whyle afterward. She was rauyſſhed out of her bodely felyng. Out of this rauyſſhyng came many merueylous thynges that foloweth afterward▪ as well of her grete abſtynence as of her merueylous doctryne: And alſo vpon myracles the whiche oure lorde ſhewed in her by her lyffe / now than leſt there be ſomme that wolde be in doubte whether this holy mayde hadde ſuche reuelacions or not. I ſhalle telle you how her confeſſour Mayſter Reymound preued it whether her reoelacions and vyſyons were trewe or not / At the begynnyng whan Mayſter Reymound herde of her hye cōuerſaciō of liuyng he begā to waxe homely wyth her in comunycacion wyth her / for he coude not fele it verely yt ſuche reuelacyons in her myght be trewe the whiche myſtruſte was for his better / And therfore he enquyred by diuers menes and wayes to knowe whether they came of god. or of the fende: Or whether they were fals or trewe:
               For thenne came to his mynde of ypocritis the whiche regnyd in his dayes / and

that he founde many dyſcetys / & namely amōges wymmen / whom ye deuyll dyſceyued wyth ye vyce aboue all other creaturs
               Hyt came alſo in to his mynde how ye fyrſt womman Eue was deceyued / and many ſuche other / & therefor he doubted the more of this holy mayde. Whyle he ſtode long thus in ſuche a doubte / it came to his mynde / that yf he myght by hir prayers gete of our lord one grete contrycyon for hys ſynnes aboue the cuſtomable contrycyon yt he was wonte to haue / by that myght he knowe that all hyr vyſyons reuelacyons & dedys come of the holy ghoſt
               For ther may none gete ſuche a contrycyon / but by yefte of the holy ghoſt. And all be it that ther is none lyuyng that can ſaye whether he be worthy of god hate or loue Yet hertely contrycyon for ſynnes is a grete token of grace Mayſter Reymond had not ſo ſone thought thys / that he went to thys holy mayde / & prayed hir hertely / that ſhe wold praye for hym to oure lord / yt he woucheſauf to for gyue hym the ſynnes the whyche he had done To whom thys holy mayde anſwerd & ſayd that ſhe wold full gladly. Than ſayde mayſter Reymond that he myght not be eaſyd in his deſyre by hyr prayers onely but yf he had there of a bull that hys ſynnes were for gyuen Of whom thys holy mayde axed wyth a ſmylynge chere / what bull he deſyred to haue. He anſwerd that in token of a bull he axed one grete contrycyon for hys ſynnes / the whiche contrycyon thys holy mayde ſayde he ſhold haue all redy. Thenne that tyme hyt ſemed to mayſter Reymond that ſhe vnderſtode clerely all hys thoughtes / & ſo he went from hyr. On the morne it happed mayſter Reymond for to be ſeek and laye don in his bedde / whom kepte one of hys brethern a deuoute man the whyche was called Nycholas of Pyſe. The place ther he lay in ſeek was an hows of ſuſtres in as moche as he caught hys ſekenes ſodeynle Jorneyng by the waye. Whan this holy mayde perceyued that he was ſeke. She a

And hyr felawe anſwerd & ſayd that it was no nede / & though it were nede / yet was ſhe more ſeker than he Neuertheleſſe yet ſhe come to hym and axyd how he ferd.
               Anone whan he ſawe hyr he meruaylled gretety & ſayd to hyr as fe

                  illy as he myght ſpeke. Aa lady why come ye hyther / ye be agrete dele ſeker than I am.
               Thanne ſhe began to ſpeke of the goodneſſe of our lord as ſhe was wonte to do and of oure vnkyndneſſe ayenſt hym.
               Wyth that mayſter Reymond hir confeſſour aroſe vp out of hys bedde gretely comforted by hyr wordes / and ſate in an other bedde beſyde / hauyng no mynde yet of the wordes that the holy mayde ſpake to hym at euen afore All this whyle ſhe contynued in ſpekyng of the kyndenes of our lord / and of oure grete vnkyndenes.
               Sodeynly in tyme of hyr deuoute comunycacyon came to hys mynde a clere conſyderacyon of hys ſynnes / that hym thought he ſtode afore the ryghtwys Jugement to be condempned to the peyne for his wycked lyuyng ryght as a theef that ſtood before a temporall Juge. Hym thought alſo that he ſawe in hys ſoule the grete benygnyte & the mekenes of our lorde / that gracyouſly delyuered hym fro the peyne that he was worthy for to haue / & not onely that / but alſo he clothed hym wyth hys owne clothes / ther he was naked / and had hym in hys holy hows / and

fedde hym and nouryſſhed hym / and accepted hym to hys ſeruyce / and ther to by the ſynguler grace of hys ende. Loo the goodneſſe / hys deth / vnto lyf / hys drede vnto hope / hys ſorow vnto ioye / & hys ſhame vnto worſhyp. By thyſe conſyderaciōs & clerely knowynges / and ſyghte of hys ſoule / the wyckettes of the wyndowes of his harde herte were broken vp & opened / and the wellys & ryuers of wepyng terys aperyd plenteuouly / by cauſe that the foundament & the grounde of hys treſpaſſys were ſhewed ſo clerely to hym / in ſo moche that he wayled & that he was aferde laſte by ſuche grete plente of ſorow / hys herte & his breſt wold haue to barſt Whan thys holy mayde ſaw that ſhe was ſtyll & ſuffred hym a whyle to be fedde wyth hys owne terys / for therefore ſhe came. Wythin a whyle after he ceſſyd lytell & lytell / and bethought him meruayllouſly of this newe grace / thynkyng alſo of hys petycyon the whiche he axed of this holy mayde the day before / wyth that he torned to hyr & ſayd / is thys thy bull that I ſpak of to you yeſterdaye. She anſwerd & ſayd ye laynge hir hondes vpon hys ſholdres ſeyeng thus / haue in mynde fader of the gracyous yeftes of our lord. And ſoo wente home to hyr chambre / and he abode ſtylle wyth hys felawe gretely edyfyed & comforted. Another tyme the ſame mayſter Reymond had another excellent token of thys holy mayde wyth out ony axyng afore Hit happed on a tyme that thys holy mayde was vyſyted by dyuers ſekenes / & laye ſeek in hyr bedde. And ſent after hyr confeſſour deſyryng to comen wyth him pryuely of other newe reuelacyons / the whyche our lord had ſhewed her grete ſekeneſſe beganne to ſpeke of the goodnes of our lord / and of the reuelacion that he ſhewed hyr that day. He heryng ſo grete reuelacyon
                     •
                   and wonderfull ſhewed to hyr / and to none other that euer he herde of / hauyng no mynde of the grace that our lord hadde gyue hym afore by prayers of this holy mayde. He bethought hym of ſomthynges that ſhe reherſed and ſayd to himſelf thus / whether it be all trewe that ſhe ſeyth. Whanne he had thought thus / he loked ſodeynly in hyr face / and ſaw that hyr vyſage was tranſformed in to mannes vyſage berded / the whyche vyſage behelde hym ſtedfaſtly / and made hym ſore aferde. Hit was to his ſyght a ſemely longe vyſage of myddel age / not hauynge to long a berde / but of a reſonable aſſiſe coloured after whete / ſhewyng in his ſyghte a mageſte after the mageſte of oure lord Jheſu / and myght in no wyſe for that tyme ſee none other face / but onely that face. Of thys ſyght he had ſo grete a fere / that he lyfte vp his armes and began to crye and ſayd. Oo who is he that loketh vpon me. To whome this holy mayde anſwerd and ſayd. He that is ſeeth and beholdeth you wyth that worde / that dredefull face vanyſſhed awaye / and the maydens vyſage appyred to him clerely. Thys was no feynyng thyng but a trewe / as he recordeth & bereth wytnes in hys wrytynges He recordeth alſo for the more confyrmacyon of that myracle that after that ſenſybly vyſyon / he hadde ſoo clere a knowyng wythin hymſelf im his ſowle by ghoſtly Illumynyng of the mater that the holy mayde ſpak to hym / of the whiche he wyll not pupplyche it openly. That hym thought he felt in experyence that thyng the whyche our lorde ſayd to hys dyſcyples whan he behote them the holy ghooſt ſeyeng to theim thus
               Et que ventura ſunt annunciabit vobis. That is whan ye haue receyued

the holy ghoſt / he ſhall ſhewe thynges that ben to come Loo For the myſtruſt that he hadde to her wordes oure lorde of his gracyous goodneſſe woucheſauf to teche hym clerely by him ſelf / he afterward for to bere wyttenes to other that hir reuelacions weren & ben trewe pryntyng ſtedfaſtly in his mynde / the grete graces that he ſhewed to Saynt Thomas of Inde / for he that wolde not be taught & enfourmed by open tokenes of gracyous gyfte / the whyche he receyued by this holy mayde he was taught and enformed by example of ſuche a diſciple that was myſtrowyng as he was For after tyme he had receyued a gracyous token of conpunccyon of our lord a fore by merytes of holy prayers of this holy mayde / yet he contynued in myſtruſt of hyr reuelacyons that they were not trewe. Wherefor our lord himſelf / ſhewed hym ſelf openly to his outeward wyttys / that he myght therby knowe by open experyence that he ſpak in hir ſo that it may be ſayd that he ſhewed him thenne to mayſter Reymond / the whiche myſtrowed as he dyd ſom tyme to ſaynt Thomas of Inde by bodely felyng. And ryght as he cryed afterward & ſayd this worde Deus meus et dominus meus.
               That is my god & my lord So may thys myſtrowynge renuwed ſaye after thiſe two vyſyōs of this holy mayde / that ſhe is & was the veray ſpouſe and the veray diſcyple of our lord god. All theſe ben reherſed to you maydens / that ye ſholde be in no doubte / ne deſpyſe the reuelacions and the vyſyons / the whiche ye ſhall here by the helpe of god afterward Alle be it that no wytnes may be founde of recorde ſaue ſhe allone / but that ye ſholde here hem / rede hem / & vnderſtonde hem with reuerence. And alſo that ye may lerne ther by holy examples & doctrynes / the whiche our lord hath ſhewed in ſuche a veſſell by kynde ſeke & bryttell. But by grace meruaylouſly made ſtrong and precyous. And thus I make an ende of this chapytre. All thoo thynges the whiche mayſter Reymond was taught & enfourmed of this holy mayde / he hath declared them openly in this chapytre. Outake one thyng that he was charged by hyr to kepe it pryuely of a certeyn reuelacion as it is reherſed a fore.

Therfore now I ſhall procede forth & ſhewe you the ſpyrytuall edyfycacyon of this ſame mayde. And by cauſe that trewe ſowles & feythfull ben fedde and edyfyed by the wordes of our lord. Therefor I ſhall telle you & ſhewe you a notable doctryne of ye whiche this holy mayde was taught of our lord him ſelf. Thys holy mayde tolde to hyr confeſſours amonges whom mayſter Reymond was one / that in the begynnyng of hyr vyſyons our lord appyred to hyr whan ſhe prayed & ſayde to hyr in this wyſe. Knoweſt thou not doughter who thou arte / and who I am yf thou knowe well theſe two wordes / thou art / and ſhalt be bleſſyd Thou art ſhe that art not / and I am he that am.

Thanne ſhe dyſputed wyth hyr ſelf whrther ſhe ſholde gyue hym hyr owne cote or not / by cauſe ſhe hadde noo moo but one / charyte ſayde yes / but hone ſte ſayd nay. Atte laſt charyte oueroo me honeſte / that is for to ſay charyte that longeth to the ſowle / ouercome honeſte the whiche hadde compaſſyon vpon the body

And thanne ſhe anſwered to the poure man thus. Trewely dere frende yf it were honeſt and lefull to me for to gyue my cote that I were thou ſholdeſt haue it gladdely.

Whanne he was borned fro hir / this holy mayde perceyued by certeyn ſygnes that it ſholde be he the whiche was wonte to appere to hir and was often tymes conuerſaunt wyth hyr / ſhe was in manere of doubte / but hyr herte brenned in loue. Neuertheleſſe in as moche as ſhe helde hir ſelf to comyne occupacyon of houſholde as ſhe was wonte to do The next nyght ſuyng our lord Jheſu cryſte appered to hyr / as ſhe prayed in lykenes of that poure man holdyng in hys honde that cote that the holy mayde gaf hym arayed wyth clere ſhynyng precyous ſtones / and ſayd to hyr thus Dere doughter knoweſt thou not this dote / ſhe anſwered and ſayd yes / but ſhe gaf it not ſo arrayed: To whome our lord ſayd ageyne. Thou gaueſt me yeſter daye this cote ſo frely & ſo charytable that it voyded awaye fro me the peyne of colde Therfore I ſhall now gyue the a cote / the whiche ſhall be Inuyſyble to men / but to the it ſhall be ſenſyble.

Thys clothe I gyue the all the whyle thou dwelleſt in erthe in token of thy clothe of ioye / that thou ſhalt be arayed wythin heuen Thus this vyſyon ceſſyd. After that the holy mayde hadde ſoo grete grace in receyuyng of that ghoſtly gyfte / not onely in hir ſowle but alſo in hir body / that fro that houre in

For euer afterward as ſhe ſemed ſhe felte that ghoſtly cote vpon hyr / the whiche our lord gaf hir / and that was the cauſe that ſhe felte no colde. See ye not maydens of what worthynes this holy mayde was that folowed Saynt Nycholas in gyuyng of atmeſpryuely / and folowed ſaynt martyn in gyuyng of hyr owne clothes the whiche our lord allowed by hys holy apperyng to thys bleſſyd mayde. And there to gaf hyr a ſenſyble and an euerlaſtyng token / for to fele in erthe how pleſaūt almes dedes ben to hym. Me ſemeth that whan our lorde ſayd to thys holy mayde that he wolde ſhe we hyr that lytell croſſe at the daye of dome the whiche ſhe gaue in almes And alſo that he wolde araye hyr wyth a clothe of ioye / in heuen is no thyng ellys but a ſikernes of endeles helthe.

               Another tyme alſo it befyll that thys holy mayde fulfylled wyth compaſſyon perceyued that ther was a man the whiche made him pore wylfully for goddes loue and lacked mete / wherfore ſhe toke preuely a lynnen bagge and fylled it wyth egges / and bare it wyth hyr preuely vnder hyr

               Whanne ſhe was thus rauyſſhed / it happed ſodeynly that the body bowed to a pyler caſuelly on that ſyde that the egges were on / ſo that ſhe lened fully vpon the bagge wyth eggeſ / thanne was ther in the ſame bagge for goten a fore a thymbyll as tayllours ſowen wyth / the whiche thymbyll was broken in thre partyes by burthon of hir body / but the eyren that charyte hyd there were hole & in noo partye broken. Now was thys a meruayllous thyng that the eyren were hole / and the thymbyll of coper was to broke / ſo our lorde ſhewed there hys myracle in the charytable eyren. For our lord ſhewed his helpe not only by this holy mayde to nedy folke / but alſo he ſhewed hys myracle in hyr by werkes of his godhede

It befylle that the meyne of the houſholde had dronke amonges

them a certeyn veſſell of wyne / ſo that the remenaūt the whiche was lefte was not freſſhe for to gyue to poure men / in aſmoche ſhe had in cuſtome to gyue them of the beſte for goddes loue. She went hyr than to the next veſſell of wyne there beſyde in hyr faders ſeller / and tamed that for poure folke And gaf them largely ther of euery day as they neded many dayes to gyder / and it was not aſpyed of the meyne. At the laſt whan the fyrſt veſſell was done / the boteler mynyſtred drynke to the meyne of the veſſell the whyche the holy mayde had tamed. Yet the holy mayde left not therfore / but alwaye ſhe gaue ther of to the poure folke / and ye more the meyne dronke / the more largely ſhe gaue to poure folke / and it was not aſpyed / ne the wyne was neuer the vnfreſſher ne neuer the laſſe in the veſſell / but allewaye kepte his eſtate / bothe in fulneſſe & in freſſheneſſe. Alle the meyne of the houſholde gretely meruaylled ther of that the veſſell contynued ſo long / and the wyne was ſo good and ſo freſſhe / for it was well knowe a fore / that ſuche a veſſell of wyne myght not laſte ouer xv dayes or xx dayes at the fertheſt Neuertheleſſe it contynued not onely xx dayes / but a full moneth complete And yet it ſemyd that the veſſell was noo wyſe leſſened.
               All the meyne had meruayll ther of yt the wyne was ſo good & ſo freſſhe & laſtyd ſo long. For better wyne them ſemed they taſtyd neuer It was vnknowe to them all how that myght be / but the holy mayde knewe well I nogh yt it was by myracle of our lord / by cauſe of the almes that ſhe gaue ther of the more largely to the poure folke. And therfore ſhe gaue ther of the more largely to pour folke openly that all the meyne myght ſee it and yet it ſemed neuer the leſſe in the veſſell. O moneth was paſſyd & an other began to entre / & yet the wyne contynued euer lyke freſſhe / & lyke full as it dyd fyrſte in to the tyme the grapes were rype for to make newe wyne. Whenne the g

Atte the laſte the veſſell was vndone for to be gawgid to knowe ther by what was lefte in the veſſell / & it was founde all drye as though ther had no wyne be ther Inne many monthes afore Thenne all the houſholde were more amexuaylled of ye myracle thenne they were of the habundaunce of wyne afore.

For euery day on the morowe / and euery nyght at euen / ſhe vyſyted the ſame ſeek womman by hyr owne perſone conſyderyng in that ſame leprous womman hir ſpouſt Jheſu with hyr ghooſtly eye.

For ſhe ſayde that ſhe knewe well ynough yt this mayde was not onely pure and clene from fleſſhely ſynnes / but alſo ſhe was holy and fulfylled wyth the holy ghooſt / and that ſhe knewe well. Thenne ſomme of the ſaddeſt of hyr ſuſters axyd hyr pryuely and wyſely how ſhe knewe that the mayde was holy / and what tokens ſhe hadde therof.

In a tyme whanne thys holy mayde weſſhyd hyr ſeek ſuſters horryble wounde / there cam ſuche a ſauour out therof that ſhe was in poynte to caſte out all that was in hyr body. Thenne ſhe roſe ageynſt hyr ſelf & ſo moche the more vyolently that ſhe had the vyctorye of another temptacyon by the grace of the holy ghooſt / and ſayde to hir ſelf thus Trewly wretche thou that haſt ſo moche abhomynacyon thou ſhalte receyue it wythin the.

               He prayed thenne for them whome he ſawe afore that wolde haue no parte of his paſſion / the whiche was to him peynfull paſſyon. And by cauſe he loued ryghtwyſneſſe / he put a condycyon and ſayd. Verūtamen non mea voluntas That is neutheleſſe fader be not my wyll fulfylled / but thy wyll / and yf he had not putto ſuche a condycyon / it wolde haue folowed ther on ſhe ſayd that all folk ſhold haue be ſaued. After tyme thenne that he had thus prayed / he was herde as ſaynte Poule ſayd for hys reuerence. Exauditus eſt ꝓpter ſuam reuerenciā In expoſycion of this wordes of ſaynt Poule comynly doctours vnderſtonden the ſame It had be ellys meruaylle but that the ſame ſone of god ſholde haue be herde. Alſo ſhe ſayd another tyme to mayſter Reymond & taught hym that the paſſyons whiche our our lord god Jheſu Cryſt ve ray god and man ſuffred for the helthe of mankynde were ſo myghty / that it were impoſſyble ony man in erthe for to ſuffre but that he ſholde dye & it were poſſyble many tyme yf that he ſuffred them. For ryght as his loue yt he had thenne / & hath yet to mankynde vneſtymable / & vncomperable. Ryght ſo hys paſſyon that he ſuffred by conſtreynyng of loue allone was vneſtymable. Who wolde beleue that the thornes of hys crowne ſholde peryſſhe in to the brayne. Or that the bones of a quyk man ſholde be drawe out of theyre ioyntes For the ꝓphete ſayd of our lordes paſſyon thus. Dinumerauerūt omnia▪ oſſa mea. That is they tolde & nombred all the bones of my body
               So thenne it may be proued yt the pryncypall cauſe of hys paſſyon was loue / the whiche he ſhemed for mankynde And it myght not be ſhewed more conuenyently than by hys paſſyon. By this it ſemed that the naylles helde hym not vpon the croſſe / but hys loue onely. Ne the

ſtrengthe of man ouercame hym 
                     •
                  ot / but loue. How were men ſo ſtronge for to holde hym / that at a worde of hys mouthe they fyll doune to the grounde whan they came for to take hym Suche hyghe wordes & conuenyent wordes of our lordes paſſyon this holy mayde cōmyne wyth mayſter Reymond. And yet ſhe ſayd more that ſhe had experyence in hyr body of ſom maner of paſſyon that Cryſt ſuffred on the croſſe▪ Of all ſhe wold not ſay for that was Impoſſyble to ony erthely creature. But ſpecyally by cauſe of the grete loue that ſhe had to our lord & to his paſſyon the moſt peyne yt ſhe ſuffred was in hyr herte / ſoo that it ſemed to hyr other whyle that hyr herte was to braſte & cutt a ſondre fro that one ende to that other.
               And for thys grete peyne of loue / ſhe was oftymes dede to all mennys ſyght.
               Of thys bare wytnes many one / the whiche were preſente whanne ſhe dyed for the loue of Cryſtys paſſyon allone.
               Here of was mayſter Reymond in grete doubte. But for to put awaye that doubte / he thought to comen wyth this holy mayde & ſerche the ſothe of hyr whether it were ſo or no. Whanne he axed hyr this. She for grete wepyng coude gyue none anſwer long tyme to gydre / but at the laſt ſhe ſayde. Fader wolde ye not haue grete pyte & compaſſyon of a ſowle that were delyuered out of a derke pryſon to lyght / and after tyme it had ſee ſo mery a lyght / efteſones to be recluſed ageyn in the ſame derke pryſone. I am that ſame wretche that thus happed me by the ordynaunce of god for my ſynnes. Then ne mayſter Reymond axed hir where hir ſowle was fully departed fro the body.
               To whome ſhe anſwerd & ſayd thus. That the feruent fyre of dyuyne loue & of ghooſtly deſyre was ſo moche in hyr herte for to lyue with our lord endeleſly whom ſhe loued. That though hyr herte hadde be of ſtone or of yren it muſt nedys to breſte. Therfore fader vnderſtondeth thys for trouthe that myn herte of myn body was thenne vndo & opened fro the ouermoſt partye to the nether / onely by the ſtrengthe of pure loue / ſo that me ſemeth yet I fele the markys of that ſyſſure in myn herte. By this ye may knowe yt the ſowle was fully for that tyme deꝑted fro the body / and ſette in the preſence of god / where I ſawe the preuyt
                     •
                  es of god / that is vn
                     •
                  efull for to ſpeke to ony man on erthe For ther is no ſpeche in erthe that can expreſſe the preuytees in ony mānis tongue. But this wote I well as ofte as I here of that mater I am tourmented ſo gretly in my ſowle conſyderyng where I was thenne & where I am now / that I can not tell my ſorowe but wyth wepynge & ſobbyng. Thenne mayſter Reymond prayed hyr to tell him how that all this began in hyr. She anſwerd & ſayde. After tyme that I was fedde and comforted wyth many vyſyons & reuelacyons by our lordes mercy / I fell ſeek for pure loue & laye doun in myn bedde where I prayed our lorde Jheſu that he wolde delyuer me out of this wretchyd worlde / and oned me perfytely to him The whiche for that tyme he wolde not graunte me.
               But he graūted therfore as long as I lyued in this lyf / ſhold be partyner of his paſſyon / in aſmoche as it is poſſyble a dedly body for to ſuffre / and ſoo ſhe tolde hym all that / that is reherſed afore. And more ouer ſhe ſayd / loo fader by ſuche experyence of hys paſſyon / I am made ſo ſeke by the ſtrengthe of loue / that my ſowle deſyred no thyng ellys but for to be delyuered out of this world And the ſame fyre ſo encrecyd in my ſowle that my herte

often tymes defayled & departed a ſonder and my ſoule was vtterly delyuered out of the body Neuertheleſſe it was but a lytell tyme & that was my ſorowe. Then ne efteſones mayſter Reymond axed hir how long tyme hyr ſowle was out of the body. She ſayd as they that kepte hyr & were aboute to haue beryed hyr foure houres or thēne ſhe reuyued ageyn Yet he axed hyr what ſhe ſawe for that tyme / & why came the ſoule ageyne to the body ſhe anſwerd thus Fader that tyme my ſowle ſawe & vnderſtode ioye of bleſſyd ſowles / and peynes of ſynners. And as myn mynde wold ſuffre me & wordes wolde ſuffyce to expreſſe them / I ſhall tell you. My ſowle ſawe the diuyne eſſen cyall beyng of god / and that is the cauſe why I am ſoo lothe & vnpacyent to lyue in this worlde / and had not be the loue of hym & the loue of cryſten people / for whiche my ſowle was reſtoryd to the body ageyne / I ſholde had defaylled & dyed for ſorowe. The hygheſt comfort that I haue is whan I ſuffre ony dyſeaſe / for that I haue the perfyte vyſyon of god / therfore trybulacyons ben not heuyſom to me / but comfortable as ye may knowe / & other that ben conuerſaunt wyth me I ſawe alſo the peynes of dampned ſowles / and peynes of ſowles that ben in purgatory / the whiche I can not expreſſe perfytely wyth no maner of wordes. For yf wretched ſynners ſawe the leſte peyne that is there / they had leuer cheſe bodely deth an hondred tymes yf it were poſſyble / thēne for to ſuffre o daye the leſte peyne that is there. But ſpecially I ſawe hem ponyſ ſhed ſyngulerly that had ſynned in matrymony / the whiche hadde not kepte hem to gyder honeſtly as they ſholde do / but folowed the dylectacions of theyr luſtys
               Of this mayſter Reymond hir confeſ ſour axed hyr why that ſynne in ſpecyall was more greuouſly punyſſhed thenne other ſynnes / ſyth it ſo is that it is not the moſt greuous ſynne She ſayd for this ſkylle. For they had not ſoo grete conſcyence of that ſynne ne ſo grete contrycy on as they had of other ſynnes / but rather they offended in that ſynne thenne in ony other That ſynne the whiche a ſynner chargeth not for to remoue / by penaū

               Thenne this holy mayde proceded forthe in hyr mater & ſayd thus alſo. Fader whāne I had ſeen all thyſe ioyes and thes peynes wenyng my ſelf that I hadde fully be delyuered out of this body.
               Oure lorde ſayde to me / ſeeſt thou not doughter what ioye they lacke and what peyne they haue that offenden me. Torne ageyn therfore to thy body & tell to the peple theyr errour and theyr peryll. And wyth that worde I was aſtonyed for to torne ageyne to the body and ſore aferde.
               Thenne our lord ſayd to me / it is profyte to mennys ſoules that thou torne ageyne / and thou ſhalte not lyue the lyfe that thou haſt lyued a fore ne kepe the ſolytarie allone in chambre / but thou ſhalte goo a brode to wynne ſowles / I ſhall euer be wyth the / and goo wyth the bothe goyng and comyng. Thou ſhalte bere the worſhyp of my name and of ghooſtly doctryne afore grete and ſmale & laye people and clerkys and a fore Relygyous folk alſo I ſhall gyue the bothe mouth and wytte for to ſpeke that none may wythſtande the. I ſhall alſo bryng the afore byſſhoppys and curates of ſowles for to confounde there pryde. Whyles our lorde ſpak thyſe wordes ſodeynly my ſoule was reſtored ageyne to my body.
               And whanne I perceyued that I hadde grete ſorowe / that I wepte thre dayes

and thre hyghtes to gyders wythout ceſſyng And yet I can in no wyſe abſteyne ne refreyne me ther fro / whanne it cometh to my mynde how ſodeynly I was come fro the grete ioye vnto this pryſone of the body What wonder is it therfore fader though myn herte to breſt euery day conſyderyng the grete excellent ioye that tyme that I hadde / the whiche now it is ferre fro me / but all is done for the ſowle hele Therfore ther ſhall no man meruayle though I loue them paſſyngly to whome our lord hath bede me warne them of theyr ſynfull lyuyng / for I haue lefte for them a grete ioye for a certeyn tyme I wote not how long. Therfore as ſaynt Poule ſeyth. They ben now my glorye my crowne & my ioye. All thys I ſaye to you fader & to all other for to putte out of youre hertes the paſſyon of grutchyng in tyme comyng whan I ſhall be homely amonges all men. Whan mayſter Reymond herde all this & vnderſtode them / after the grace that was gyue hym / he ꝑceyued in hys herte / that for the incredulytee and blyndnes of men / all that ſhe ſayde ſholde not be publyſſhed. Wherfore he for bade bothe the freres & the ſuſtres / that all the whyle this holy mayde lyued in erthe they ſholde not pupplyſſhe that matree.
               He perceyued alſo of ſomme that folowed fyrſt hyr doctryne / how they wente backward / for they coude not ne myghte not take hyr wordes But leſte he ſholde offende god yf he hadde hydde it hymſelf wythout wrytyng / he wrote it for a perpetuell recorde after hyr dyſſece / & not whyle ſhe lyued Now maydens for to knowe veraly that al this is ſothe I ſhall tell you wytnes of recorde that were preſent wyth this holy mayde whan all thyſe thynges befyll hyr In that ſame tyme whan this holy mayde drewe nye to the deth as it ſemed & as it is reherſed afore.
               There drewe aboute hyr wymmen and other ghooſtly doughters of herys / & they ſent after hyr fyrſt confeſſour frere Thomas for do be preſent at hyr paſſage by prayers & other holy exercyſes in commē
                  dyng of hyr ſowle to god. He came & thre freres wyth hym mo to be preſent att the paſſyng of this holy mayde. But whan ſhe was paſſyd as it ſemed. One of the freres took ſo grete ſorowe therfore that by vyolence of hys wepyng / a veyne of hys breſt was all for broſyd / where wyth he caught a coghe & ſpatte gebettes of blood. Thenne was that another ſorowe to them that ſtode aboute / for bothe they wepte for the holy mayde that was ſo paſſyd. And alſo for hir brother the whiche was not ſhappely to lyue long after in that payne. Thenne ſayde frere Thomas hir fyrſt confeſſour to that ſeek frere wyth grete feyth and truſt. Brother I wote well this holy mayde is in grete reputacyon afore god for hyr good lyuyng. Therfore take hyr honde and putte in the ſame place of thy ſekenes. And I doubte not but that thou ſhalte be hole. And anone forth wyth he dyd ſo and ſo he hadde helthe / the whiche he tolde afterward to al that wolde here if Ther was alſo a ghooſtly doughter of herys that was preſent thenne / the whiche was called Alyxa / & paſſyd out of this worlde ſone afterward Moother were that came Inne for to ſee whether ſhe was paſſed or not / and ther was none that coude ſuppoſe otherwyſe There were alſo two other ſpecyall wytteneſſys / that were aboute for to ordeyne for the body that it ſholde be beryed. And bothe were ſuſters of penaunce of Saynt Domynyk / that one was called Katheryne as ſhe was / the whiche was hyr felawe longe tyme afore.

And that other was hyr coſyn Lyſa / and thus I make an ende of thys chapytre.

Whan this holy mayde hys doughter perceyued that / anone ſhe prayed to oure lorde hyr ſpouſe for the helthe of hyr fader. And it was anſwerd to hyr of our lorde / that the ende of hys dayes of this worlde were come / and that it were not ſpedefull for hym for to abyde lenger in this lyf. Then ne ſhe wente to hyr fader & vyſyted hym and examyned hym how he was dyſpoſed in hys ſowle / and founde redy & wylfully to paſſe out of this worlde / hauyng no luſte for to abyde lenger / wherefor ſhe thanked our lord hyghly But thenne ſhe prayed our lord efteſones / that ſyth it ſo is that he hadde gyuen hyr fader ſo grete grace for to paſſe out of this worlde wythout ſynne / that he wolde woucheſauf to graunte hym alſo for to flee to heuen / wythout payne of purgatory.

All be it that the bodely ſtrengthes of hir fader Jamys beganne for to defaylle more & more to the deth warde Yet hys ſoule paſſed neuer out of his body vnto the tyme yt holy & dyſputacion betwene our lord alledgyng for hym ryghtwyſneſſe.

               And kyt awaye her heer of her hede: wherof ſhe was woute be proude of / And tooke vppon her the habyte of Saynt

Domynyk and ſo was made a ſuſter of penaunce. And euer afterward ſhe lyued in prayers & medytacyons & in grete ſharpe penaunce Sone after came hir ſuſter Francyſca and took vpon hyr the ſame abyte / & lyued to gyder ryght deuoutely. Of this herde James or Jacob her brother that was not ye ſame tyme in Sene whanne his ſuſtren were torned / he came to ye Cyte ward wyth a yong brother of hys curſyng & thretnyng wyth a grete pryde all tho that excyted hys ſuſters to that abyte. Seynge & cryeng wyth a bolde ſpyryte that he wolde tere awaye that abyte fro their back & breng theim to hys hows there he dwelled To whome hys yonger brother the whiche came with hym ſayd / trewely James yf thou come to Sene / thou ſhalt be torned alſo / and be ſhryuen of thy ſynnes / with that he curſed hys brother bytterly & ſayde / that he had leuer flee bothe freres & preſtys thenne he wolde be ſhryuen to ony of hem all The chylde oftymes reherſed hys ꝓphecyes / & as ofte he curſed: So that at the laſt he entred in to the Cyte as a wood man / & forthe he wente to hys faders hows thretnyng that he wold do grete horryble thynges / but yf his ſuſtren ſpecyally Ethynoccyam wolde do awaye hyr abyte & come home to hym All this was not vnknowen to this holy mayde / but ſhe knowe it neuer by creature on erthe / but by god.
               In the mene whyle his moder Rabes ſtylled and peaſed hym / prayng hym that he wolde abyde tyll the morow: On the morow ſhe ſente to this holy maydes confeſſour frere Thomas that he wolde woucheſauf come & ſpeke with hir ſone James And counſeyll hym for hys ſowle helthe
               He came & wyth hym a felawe frere Bartholomew & ſpake to hym: But all their ſpeche as them ſemed myght not profyte in him All that ſame tyme this holy mayde Katheryne prayed to our lorde for hys conuerſyon / whiles frere Bartholomew ſpak to hym:
               And thenne ſodeynly oure lorde touched Jamys herte to contrycyon / and he ſayde to frere Bartholomew that he was well apayed of hys ſuſter that ſhe ſholde ſerue god: But alſo he prayed hym of confeſſyon wyth grete contrycyon / that he myght be ſhriuē of hys ſynnes and ſerue god alſo: He was thenne ſo perfytely ſhreuen That ſomme ſynnes whiche he wold neuer be knowe ne confeſſyd to noo man / he was confeſſyd to hym:
               Soo that wyth Inne a lytell tyme after of a wolfe he was made a lambe / and of a lyon a whelpe: That all folk that knewe hym were amerueylled of hys ſodeyne tornyng:
               His moder Rabes was a meruaylled and alle hyr meyne / and thanked oure lorde for that ſpecyall grace:
               Frere Thomas and frere Bartholomew alſo ioyed in oure lorde and wente for to tell alle this to this holy mayde / the whiche was doune / whanne they were come to here hows they foūde hyr yet in rauyſſheng / and hyr felawe was that tyme in hyr chambre wyth hyr / As ſone as ſhe was ceſſyd of hyr rauyſſheng / and reſtoryd to hyr bodely wyttes / hyr felawe came doune out of the chambre from hyr and welcomed hyr confeſſour:
               Thenne ſayde hyr confeſſour to hyr felawe: We ben come for to tell Katheryne that ſhe ſholde thanke our lord god:

were come vp to katheryne ſhe ſayde to theym wyth grete ſadnes in this wyſe / Faders we been moche bounde to thanke our ſauyour yt neuer dyſpſed the prayer of his ſeruauntis: For the ſame deſyre the whiche he enſpyred theym wyth: he fulfylled in theym / The fende wende he ſhold haue hadde awaye fro vs our lytill ſhepe. But our fader of mercy hath byreiued away from hym his pray: he wende to had away from Cryſt Shynochia / But he hath loſt James that he helde ſoo ſtronge in his bondes. For ſo it happeth euer to hym whan he reyſeth vp his hede of pryde agaynſt Cryſtis choſen / 
               Afterward that mayde Shynochya euer contynued in prayers and holy medytacions to her laſt daye. And wyth a grete ghoſtely ioye by dyuerſe ſekenes ye whiche our lord gaue her / She paſſeth to our lord out of this worlde / Thenne her ſuſter franciſca that lyued but lytyl while after folowed her in good lyuing and wyth a mery ſmylyng there ſhe paſſed alſo to god out of this world:
               ¶ Ferdermore the ſayd James her broder wythin a lytyll tyme after forſoke perfyghtly the worlde and was made a fryer prechours and lyued deuoutly euer after / All thyſe thynges were wrought by the holy ghoſt and by his ſpouſe Katheryne graunted his grace to alle tho yt ſhe prayed for / 
               ¶ Ouermore I ſhalle telle you another merueylous thynge that Mayſter Reymound bereth recorde of hym ſelf / In the ſame Cyte of Seene there was a greate man the whiche was called Nannes & he a wounder wordely wyſe man more enclynyng to euyll than to good / that man ofte tymes bycauſe of hys greate ſotyll wytte he loued ſoo moche therto that he made party in the ſame Cyte and grete enſtaunce bytwene neyghbore and nyghbore / wherof came a grete enmyte & preuy morderyng the whiche came by hym ſlyly and by his mayntynaunce / At the laſt mene perſons came bytwene for to make peas / but he anſwerd euer ſoo wylyly that he rought neuer whether there were peas or none as it ſemed to theym that herd hym / and alwaye he was glad to make vnpeas that he myght and to be avengyd after his deſyre / 
               That herd this holy mayde katheryne ſhe deſyred to ſpeke wyth him for to ſece that euyll hatered but he fledde her aſſone as he knewe that ſhe came to hym / Ryght as the ſerpent wolde flee from hym that ſholde charyne hym: At the laſte an holy man the whiche was called Fryer wyllyam of Englond a fryer auſtyn he ſpake ſoo to hym that he graunt
                     •
                   hym that he wolde gladly ſpeke wyth that hooly mayde and here her / But he ſayd he wolde nothyng doo as ſhe wolde counſeylle hym /

                   his promys and he went to the holy maydes hous the ſame tyme that mayſter Reymound was there / But that holy mayde was not therin by cauſe ſhe was gone a lytyll byfore to procure the helthe of ſoules: In the mene whyle that mayſter Reymound was therin / there came a meſſanger to hym & ſayd that Nannes was at the dore and wolde ſpeke wyth katheryn wherof mayſter Reymound was glad for he knewe well that the holy mayde had ofte tymes deſyred that / 
               And wyth that he went and welcomed hym and tolde hym that ſhe was out / & prayed hym that he wold not thynke lō
                  ge for ſhe wolde come anone / And thenne thei went to this holy maydes chapel whan they hadde ſytte a whyle there he

thought longe and ſayd to mayſter Reymond. Thus I behete frere Wyllyam / that I ſholde come hyder & here this holy lady Katheryne ſpeke / therfore ſyth ſhe is out & occupyed / I may nought abyde here wherfore I pray you excuſe me to hyr / for I haue moche thyng to do / mayſter Reymond was heuy here wyth that ſhe was ſo long / for to occupye the tyme tyll ſhe came / he axed hym of the maner of pees the whiche he knewe To whome this Nannes anſwerd▪ Syre I ſhall tell you the ſothe / for to thou that ben a preſt & a relygyous man / and to this holy mayde / of whome I here a grete name of holyneſſe. I ſhall not lye but ſaye the ſothe. Therfore what that euer I ſaye to you I am not in wyll to do by your counſeyll. Sothe it is that I am he the whiche that letteth ye pees by twene him & him and that pees & that pees. And yet it ſemed by my dedys that it am not I that lette it by cauſe it is done by other / but I maynteyn them pryuely ther to / for yf I allone wold conſente to haue pees / al ſhold be well ceſſyd But I purpoſe in no wyſe for to conſente therto / wherfore it nedeth not for to counſeyll me & preche me / for I ſhall not conſente in ony maner wyſe Loo now I haue tolde you that I haue hydde from other / tarye me no lenger and holde you apayed / yet mayſter Reymond prayed him to reherce it ageyne / for to occupye the tyme / and he wolde not / at the laſt by the dyſpoſycyon of god the holy mayde was come Inne.
               Whan that Nannes ſawe hyr / he was ryght ſory But mayſter Reymond was gladde As ſoone as ſhe ſawe that erthely man / ſhe toke him wyth an heuenly charyte & ſat doun to gydres / and axed him the cauſe of hys comyng. Thenne he reherſed to hyr all that euer he ſayd to mayſter Reymond wyth the laſt negacyon. This holy mayde beganne thenne to ſhewe him what peryll he ſtode Inne ſoo that ſhe touched hym ouer all / but as a deef ſerpent he ſtoppyd the erys of his herte that he wold not here hyr counſeylles / that conſydered this holy mayde anone. She ſat ſtyll & torned Inward & prayed our lord in hyr herte & axed hys gracyous helpe Whan mayſter Reymond aſpyed how ghooſtly ſhe was occupyed for hym. He occupyed hym wyth ſomme wordes hopyng in the mene whyle of ſom helpe of oure lorde by hir prayers / wythin a whyle aft Nannes ſayd to them bothe thus. Loo I wyll not be ſo vnkynde / but that I wyll do nye all yt euer ye wyll byd me / but ſomwhat I ſhall graunte / and thenne wyll I goo fro you.

O who is that / that holdeth me now wyth this he wept ſore & ſayd I am ouer come & I may not wythſtonde it. Thenne he kneled doun on his knees to the holy mayde and ſayd wyth wepyng chere.
               Holy mayde I ſhall do what euer thou bydde me do: Not onely of this mater but alſo of all other what that euer it be.
               I knowe well now that ye deuyll hath hadde me bounde in hys chayne hyder to / but now I ſhall do what euer ye counſeyl me to do / counſeyll my ſoule how it may be deliuerd out of ye fendes poure I praye

Therfore now good brother do penaunce for thy ſynnes by tymes / leſte a ſodeyne trybulacyon fall vpon the Thenne anone wyth grete contrycion he was ſhryuen of mayſter Rymond of all his ſynnes / & afterward by helpe of this holy mayde he made pees wyth all folk / & alſo wyth god by counſeyll of mayſter Reymond. But wythin a fewe dayes after he was take by the Juſtyce of the Cyte & put in a ſtreyte pryſon / and it was a comyn ſaynge yt he ſholde be behedyd. Thenne mayſter Reymond herde that / he came to this holy mayde wyth a ſorowfull che
                     •
                  e / and ſayd Loo moder all the whyle Nannes ſerued the fende / he had no dyſeaſe / but alwaye 
                     •
                  ſperyte And after tyme now he is torned to god / all the world is ageynſt hym where of I am a ferde by cauſe he is yette but a yong braūche / leſt he be all for broke by this tempeſt / and ſo fall in deſpeyre. I praye you therfore praye for hym to god / that he whom ye haue delyuered from the deuelys poure by your prayers / helpe him alſo & defende hym from his aduerſaryes Thenne ſhe ſayde to mayſter Reymond why be ye ſory for him for whome ye ſholde be gladde. Now be ye ſeker that our lord ſpareth him & wyll releſſe hym from endeles payne by that temporall payne.
               Fyrſt whan he was in the worlde / the worlde loued that was hys And now he is paſſyd out of the worlde / the worlde begynneth to hate hym. Fyrſt our lord reſerued for him endeles payne / but now of hys mercy he hath chaunged hys endeles payne in to temporall payne And of hys deſperacyon be thou noo thynge in doubte / for he that hath delyuered hym of helle / wyll delyuer hym gracyouſly out of thys peryll / and as ſhe ſayde ſoo it was / For wythin a whyle after he was delyuered out of pryſon / though he hadde grete loſſe of hys temporall goodys / where of thys holy mayde was no thyng ſory / but was ioyefull and ſayde that our lord of hys mercy hath do awaye fro hym the poyſon yt he was poyſoned wyth. And at the laſt he had ſo many trybulacyons / and hys deuocyon encrecyd ſo moche that he gaf to this holy mayde a fayre paleys of his vnder his letter and ſeale yt was two myle wythout the Cyte. Of the whiche paleys ſhe ſholde make a monaſtery of ſuſtres of penaunce. Thenne this holy mayde by ſpecyall lycence and auctoryte of hyr holy fader the pope Gregory the xj made there a monaſterye in the worſhyp of our lady to all hyr ghoſtly doughters and called the monaſterye the monaſterye of our lady. And Nannes that man the whyche this holy mayde conuerted was gouerned ghooſtly by mayſter Reymond and lyued after a blyſſed lyf.
               Abouen all theſe maters yf I wolde reherce all the conuerſyons of euell lyuers / all the roburacyons and the ſtrengthes of ſeek folke All the comfortes of deſolate folke or them that were in trybulacyons / all the exortacyons of them that were in ghooſtly perellys / the whiche our lorde hath meruayllouſly wrought by hys ſpouſe this holy made. I myght make many grete bokes. Who coude telle how many wretched ſynfull lyuers ſhe hath delyuered out of the fendes bondys / 
               How many obſtynate folke ſhe hath brought ageyne to theyr owne knowleche. How many ſhe had made forſake

and deſpyſed the worlde And how many tempted folk in fonle ſynnes ſhe hath delyuerd out of the fendes daunger by hyr prayers and doctrynes. Neuertheleſſe ye ſhall ſaye as ſaynt Jerome ſayd comendyng our lady / I myght ſay that yf all the membrys and lym̄ys of my body were torned in to tongues / they ſholde not ſuffyce for to tell all the fruyte of ſoules / that this holy mayde hath purpoſed to heuen by the helpe of almyghty god / mayſter Reymond bereth this trewe recorde / that he ſawe a thouſand or moo bothe of men and wymmen comyng doun fro the mounteynes and other vyllages longyng to the ſhyre of the Cyte of Sene / comyng for to ſee and here this holy mayde as though they hadde be called by an Inuyſyble trompe / the whiche not onely by hyr wordes / but alſo by hyr lokyng were ſtyred to compunccyon for to be confeſſyd of all theyr ſynnes wyth grete contricyon / & ſo theyr went two confeſſours of whome mayſter Reymond was one as he ſeyth hym ſelf / and they confeſſyd hyr ſynnes wyth ſo grete contrycion that eche man myght well knowe that there was grace gyuen of god in her hertes / & that was not onys ne twyes but oftymes.
               Wherfore the forſayd Pope Gregorye that was that tyme hadde ſoo grete ioye / and delyte of the wynnyng of ſoo many ſoules that he graūted by bull to mayſter Reymond and to hys felawes / that all thoo the whiche wolde come and vyſyte this holy mayde / and after deſyren for to be ſhreuen / they ſholde here them & aſſoylle them as moche as the byſſhop of the dyocyes myght do. Therfore mayſter Reymond bereth recorde and ſeyth / that there came many ſynfull wretches to hym and to hys felawes / the whiche were neuer ſhreuen a fore of the ſynnes / the whiche they were ſhreuen to hym and to them.
               And they ſtode ofte tymes faſtyng fro the morow tyll euen / by cauſe of grete concours of people / and yet they myght not ſuffyce for to here all that wold be ſhryuen
               All that tyme this holy mayde prayed and thanked our lord ioyefully that the fende hadde loſte hys prayer. There is no penne that can expreſſe the ioye of hir herte that ſhe had that tyme of wynnyng of ſoules. Thus moche is reherſed in this chapytre of the ghoſtly meruayllous thynges that our lord wrought by hys ſpouſe. This holy mayde Katheryne aboute the helthe of mannes ſoules.
               ¶ Now ſhall I tell you in the next chapytre what god wrought for hyr aboute the helthe of bodyes / & ſo ſhall I make an ende of the next chapytre. The wytteneſſe that nedeth to be reherſed in the ende of this chapytre / ben reherſed a fore in the ſame chapytre / and that ſuffyceth ynough.
            
            
               ¶ Of ſomme myracles done in hyr lyfe by hyr aboute the lyf and helthe of mennys bodyes. Capitulum viij
               I Shall tell you maydens a wonder meruayllous thyng. And yette it is lyght and eſye to them Inough / wyth whome is founde none vnpoſſybylyte. Lapa this holy maydes moder was a womman of grete ſympteneſſe and Innocencye. Yet ſhe hadde for that tyme lytell affeccyon to Inuyſyble thynges. And therfore ſhe was ſore aferde to dye and paſſe out of this worlde. She caught a bodely ſykenes / and it encreced day by day more and more. Whan this holy mayde this vnderſtode. She prayed to our lord deuoutely

for hyr that he wold woucheſauf to ſocour hyr moder wyth helthe / that brought hyr forth and nouryſhed hyr. She hadde an anſwer anone from heuen that it was beſte for hyr for to paſſe now out of this worlde / or thenne ſhe haue more aduerſytees that ben to come. As ſoone as ſhe wyſte this / ſhe went to hyr moder and ſayde to hyr wyttely ſuche ſwete wordes.
               Moder yf our lord ſwete Iheſu wyll calle you to hym out of this worlde / dyſpoſe you to be confourmyd to his blyſſed wyll / and beth noo thyng ſory.
               ¶ Thenne the moder deſyryng not for to deye / prayed hyr doughter to praye for hyr that oure lorde wolde woucheſauf to graunte hyr bodely hele / and ſpeke nomore to hyr of hyr deth. Thys holy mayde prayed thenne our lord hertely and feruentely that he wold woucheſauf take hir nought out of this worlde in to the tyme ſhe knewe that hyr wylle were more confourmed to hys wyll.
               ¶ Our lorde graunted hyr / hyr axynge and ſuffred hyr moder to be ſeek for a tyme / and not for to drawe to the paſſage of deth. And thenne this holy mayde was made mene betwene god and hyr moder for to praye that one / and exhorte that other. Our lord ſhe prayed that he wolde not take hyr ageynſt hyr wyll.
               And hyr moder ſhe exorted and admonyſſhed wyth ſwete wordes that ſhe ſholde confourme hyr and conſent to the wyll of god. Neuertheleſſe though in maner ſhe bowed our lord to hyr prayers yet ſhe myght not enclyne hir moder wyll by hyr exortacyons.
               ¶ Thenne our lord ſpake to hys ſpouſe Katheryne and ſayde. Telle thy moder that ſhe hath now no nede to paſſe out of this worlde / but tyme ſhall come that ſhe ſhall deſyre for to deye / and then̄e ſhe ſhal not haue it / and that was ſothe.
               ¶ Hyt befyll that ſhe lyued in to a grete age / and ſawe many aduerſytres in hyr dayes / as well of perſones as of theyr goodys / in ſo moche that ſhe ſayde ofte tymes in heryng of many folke ſuche wordes. Whether our lord Iheſu hath put a ſoule in my body / that it ſhall neuer be delyuered thens So many chyldren and doughters grete and ſmale yong and olde ben dede / and I may not deye
               ¶ Now I ſhall ceſſe of this mater and procede forthe in the fyrſt mater that I began Lapa this holy maydes moder was of ſo harde herte that ſhe wolde in no wyſe dye ne by confeſſyd / ne thynke in noo wyſe on hyr ſoule hele.
               ¶ Thenne oure lorde for to appyre more meruayllouſly in hys ſpouſe Katheryne denyed in maner as it ſemed hys fyrſte graunte. And ſuffred Lapa to drawe faſt toward the deth wythout confeſſyon Whan this holy mayde perceyued that / ſhe lyfte vp hyr eyen to heuen wyth wypyng terys & ſayd to our lord thus. A a lord god ben thiſe thy beheſtys that thou haſt graunted me / that none of my faders houſhold ſhold peryſſhe / is this thy mercyable byheſte that ſaydeſt my moder ſholde not paſſe hens ageynſt hyr wyll.
               I ſee well now that ſhe ſhall dye wythout ſacramentys of holy chyrche Therfore I beſeche the by alle thy mercyes that thou ſuffre me not to be deceyued / and that I goo not hens a lyue vnto the tyme thou haſte yolde to me my moder reuyued in ſoule and body.
               ¶ Theſe wordes and theſe meruayllous cauſe herde thre wimmen of Sene that were preſent.
               ¶ Whan hyr moder as it ſemed by ſyghte and felyng was dede / ſoo that they were aboute for to go home ageyne to theyr

howſes leuyng Lapa there for dede / yf it had not ben that the holy mayde prayed as ſhe dyd / and therfore they abode the lenger. Of the maners of theſe wymmen I ſhall tell you afterward.
               ¶ Thys holy mayde contynued long in prayers / at ye laſt our lord herde hyr prayers gracyouſly / and quyckened the ſoule and the body ageyne of Lapa / that ſhe lyued afterward vnto ye tyme ſhe was foure ſcore yere of age and nyne wyth grete torment of herte for many aduerſytres that ſhe ſuffred as it was prophecyed to hyr afore by hyr doughter this holy mayde.
               ¶ Of this myracle were wytneſſe one Katheryne and Angelyna ſuſtres of penaunce / and alſo Lyſa this holy maydes coſyn they were preſent whan Lapa was leyde forthe for dede and herden how this holy mayde prayed to oure lorde thus.
               Lorde ben theſe thy beheſtys that thou behote me as it is ſayd afore. Of the remeynaunt of hyr age / whan ſhe was reſtoryd ageyne to lyf / bare wyttenes many one. Lo ye maydens here may ye knowe of what meryte this holy mayde was wyth our lord Iheſu that delyuered hyr faders ſoule out of purgatory / and reduced hyr moders ſoule in to hir body ageyne meruayllouſly.
               ¶ Another meruayllous thyng ſhall I tell you. It happened that ther was a comyn peſtylence of bocchys reygnyng in the Cyte of Sene / ſoo that it oppreſſyd bothe men and wymmen / yong and olde to the deth / that comynly they dyed wythin two dayes or thre at the fertheſt / the whiche ſekenes feryd many a man.
               ¶ Thenne mayſter Reymond wente aboute to vyſyte ſeek folke / and comforted them in god no thyng chargyng of the Infeccyon of that peſtylence touchyng hys bodely deth / ſoo that he myght wynne ſoules. Whanne he hadde ſo vyſyted them for werynes that he had in goyng aboute / he reſtyd hym in a chyrche of our lady / where to he hadde a grete deuocyon / and namely for the perſone of the ſame chyrche was a bleſſyd lyuer and well knowen wyth thys holy mayde Katheryne / the whiche perſone was called Syr Mathewe.
               ¶ It befyll fewe dayes after that mayſter Reymond wente out by the morowe for to vyſyte ſeek folke as he was wonte And as he came by the chyrche of our lady for deuocyon that he hadde to our lady in that place / and alſo for affeccyon that he hadde to the perſone ſyr Mathewe / he wente for to loke how he ferde.

Yette ſhall I tell you another meruayllous thynge that our lord wrought by hyr in the cyte of Tholetane. Whan this holy mayde was entred in to the Cyte of Tholetane / ſhe took hir Inne / and anone ſhe wente in to hir chambre as ſhe was wonte to do In to ye whiche mayſter Reymond was come on the popes meſſage. Sodeynly thenne he herde in the ſtretys of the Cyte of wymmen / that an holy wommā was come & entred in to the Cyte Then ne ſoone after cam men / and after wymmen to hyr Inne & axed where thys holy mayde was. They of the Inne myght not hyde hyr / but they ſuffred wymmen onely to goo in to hyr & ſpeke wyth hyr.
               Thenne ther was one of the wommen that hadde a lytell chylde / whos whombe was meruayllouſly ſwolle. And they prayed this holy mayde that ſhe wold take that childe in hyr armes / at the begynnyng ſhe refuſed it / by cauſe of vayn glorye / but at the

All be it that mayſter Reymond ſawe not this myracle / yet ther was ſo open ſpeche therof in the Cyte of Tholetane yt it came to the byſſhopys ere / and ſent after mayſter Reymond & prayed hym that he myght ſpeke wyth ye holy mayde / for the childe was neuewe to a vycary of hys. And than this holy mayde came & ſpake wyth the byſſhop of many vertuous maters. Many moomeruayls our lord wrought by this holy

mayde that ben not wryten in this book.
               But theſe fewe I haue wryten to you maydens by cauſe that ye ſhall the ſonner gyue credence that our lord Jheſu Cryſte dwellyd in this holy maydens ſoule / the whiche principally wrought all thyſe meruayllous werkys / wytnes of tho maters ye whiche ben reherced in this chapytre ben reherced afore in tho places where theſe my racles were ſhewed / and thus endeth this chapytre.

Ther was in the Cyte of Sene a man / the whiche was called mychael that vſed the craft of wrytyng / whan he was paſſed in yeres of age by conſent of hys wyf / he was in purpoſe to leue ye worlde / & ſerue our lord more ſpecyally thenne he was wonte. And alſo for to make two doughters of hys mynchyns in a monaſterye in the ſame Cyte of Sene endowed in worſhyp of ſaynt Johan the Enange lyſt & ſo hys lyſt was fulfylled. And at the laſt by a pryue dome of god / one of his doughts the whiche was made a myn then that was called Laurencyana of vill yere of age or there aboute / was vexed with a fende ſo yt all the monaſterye was vnquyeted by hyr vexacyon. And at ye laſt by comyn aſſent they ſent after hyr fader & delyuered ageyne hys doughter / for they wold nomore haue hyr in the monaſterye as long as ſhe was ſo vexed.
               Whan ſhe was take out of the monaſterye / the fende ſpak wythin hir by ye childys mouth many wondre thynges & all in latyn wordes / ſo many herde queſtyōs & ther to pupplyſſhed many pryue ſynnes in ſclaunder of many folke / by ye whiche it myght well be vnderſtond yt he was no good ſpyryte Of this vexacyon hyr fader & moder and other of hir frendes were ryght ſory / & wente aboute to dyuerſe relyques of ſentes for to ſeke helpe & grace that her doughter myght be delyuerd of that ſpiryte And ſpecyally they truſted gretely in the relyques of ſaynt Ambroſe the whiche was a frere prechour / to whome our lord graunted a ſynguler gyfte / to put awaye wycked ſpyrytes / ſoo that hys cope yf it had be layde vpon ony creature that had be vexed wyth a wicked ſpiryte it ſholde be auoyded / where fore the ſame chylde was brought to the frere prechours & leyde vpon a tombe of ſaint ambroſe / & hys clothes were leyde to the childe / and the fader & the mod prayed in the mene whyl the helpe ef god & of ye ſente yt the chylde myght be ſocourre. But yet for that tyme were they not herde. Not for no ſynne that euer they dyd But I trowe be cauſe yt the ſyguler remedyes was reſerued to this holy mayde. Thenne was it counſeylled to the fad & mod for to preſente hyr doughter to Pratheryne the holy mayde / they ſent to ye holy mayde prayenge hyr yt ſhe wolde helpe theyre doughter. And ſhe ſent ageyn anſwer & ſayd / that

often tymes defayled & departed a ſonder and my ſoule was vtterly delyuered out of the body Neuertheleſſe it was but a lytell tyme & that was my ſorowe. Then ne efteſones mayſter Reymond axed hir how long tyme hyr ſowle was out of the body. She ſayd as they that kepte hyr & were aboute to haue beryed hyr foure houres or thēne ſhe reuyued ageyn Yet he axed hyr what ſhe ſawe for that tyme / & why came the ſoule ageyne to the body ſhe anſwerd thus Fader that tyme my ſowle ſawe & vnderſtode ioye of bleſſyd ſowles / and peynes of ſynners.

My ſowle ſawe the diuyne eſſen cyall beyng of god / and that is the cauſe why I am ſoo lothe & vnpacyent to lyue in this worlde / and had not be the loue of hym & the loue of cryſten people / for whiche my ſowle was reſtoryd to the body ageyne / I ſholde had defaylled & dyed for ſorowe. The hygheſt comfort that I haue is whan I ſuffre ony dyſeaſe / for that I haue the perfyte vyſyon of god / therfore trybulacyons ben not heuyſom to me / but comfortable as ye may knowe / & other that ben conuerſaunt wyth me I ſawe alſo the peynes of dampned ſowles / and peynes of ſowles that ben in purgatory / the whiche I can not expreſſe perfytely wyth no maner of wordes. For yf wretched ſynners ſawe the leſte peyne that is there / they had leuer cheſe bodely deth an hondred tymes yf it were poſſyble / thēne for to ſuffre o daye the leſte peyne that is there. But ſpecially I ſawe hem ponyſſhed ſyngulerly that had ſynned in matrymony / the whiche hadde not kepte hem to gyder honeſtly as they ſholde do / but folowed the dylectacions of theyr luſtys
               Of this mayſter Reymond hir confeſſour axed hyr why that ſynne in ſpecyall was more greuouſly punyſſhed thenne o ther ſynnes / ſyth it ſo is that it is not the moſt greuous ſynne She ſayd for this ſkylle. For they had not ſoo grete conſcyence of that ſynne ne ſo grete contrycyon as they had of other ſynnes / but rather they offended in that ſynne thenne in ony other That ſynne the whiche a ſynner chargeth not for to remoue / by penaū
                  ce is a grete ſynne be it neuer ſoo lytell.
               Thenne this holy mayde proceded forthe in hyr mater & ſayd thus alſo. Fader whāne I had ſeen all thyſe ioyes and thes peynes wenyng my ſelf that I hadde fully be delyuered out of this body.
               Oure lorde ſayde to me / ſeeſt thou not doughter what ioye they lacke and what peyne they haue that offenden me. Torne ageyn therfore to thy body & tell to the peple theyr errour and theyr peryll. And wyth that worde I was aſtonyed for to torne ageyne to the body and ſore aferde.
               Thenne our ford ſayd to me / it is profyte to mennys ſoules that thou torne ageyne / and thou ſhalte not lyue the lyfe that thou haſt lyued a fore ne kepe the ſo lytarie allone in chambre / but thou ſhalte goo a brode to wynne ſowles / I ſhall euer be wyth the / and goo wyth the bothe goyng and comyng.

               ¶ Now yette ſhall I tell you of another myracle that mayſter Reymond bereth recorde of / the whyche was done after tyme that this holy mayde was paſſed out of this worlde in to the blyſſe of heuen. In a tyme hit happed mayſter Reymond by counſeyll of the Pryour of the freres and the couent / wolde doo ſomme ſolempne reuerence to the hede of Saynt Katheryne this blyſſed virgyne / after tyme that it was tranſlated out of the Cyte of Rome to the freres that dwelled at Sene. He ſette a daye and bad to mete all hyr ghoſtely chyldren that ſhe had nouryſſhed in vertue. In the whyche day the freres were fully auyſed to gyue hyr a ſolempne reuerence / and alſo to fede that day all hyr ghooſtly chyldren. Whan the day was comen and the ſolenpne was done. The frere that kepte the botrye of the couent loked what brede he hadde for the Couent / and for the geſtys / and he founde ſcarſely ynough for half the Couent And thenne were there in Couent fyfty or there aboute and of geſtys twenty / whan the Pryour herde here of he was ſory. Neuertheleſſe yet he ſerued the geſtyn fyrſt wyth that lytell / and thenne the Couent wyth a lytell quantyte among them all / and yet belefte ynough Soo thenne eueryche of the Couent and of the geſtys hadde plenteuouſly ynough / of that vnnethe as them ſemed that lytell nombre of louys myght hadde ſuffyſed fyfe a fore. Whan they had all eten / the Pryour and the Couent

came thyder ther mayſter Reymond ſatte wyth the ghooſtly chyldren of that holy mayde Saynt Katheryne / and reherſed a fore them all that myracle. Thenne ſayde mayſter Reymond theſe wordes. Loo frendes this holy mayde Saynt Katheryne in the day of hyr ſolempnyte wyll not leue vs wythout ſomme myracle / wyth whome ſhe was ſo famylyer whyles ſhe lyued in erthe. Ofte tymes whan ſhe was wyth vs lyuyng in this lyf ſhe ſhewed this myracle among vs And therfore for to ſhewe vs that ſhe now accepteth oure obſeruaunce this daye done to goddes worſhyp and to herys / ſhe hadde ſhewed the ſame myracle efteſonys after hyr paſſyng / wherfore yelde we thankyng te almyghty god. Yet furthermore our lord ſhewed meruayllous thynges by his ſpouſe Katheryn in vnlyfely thynges / as in floures where in ſhe hadde ofte tymes grete delyte by cauſe ſhe floryſſhed in vertue hyr ſelf. And in other veſſelles of houſhold that were loſt & deſtruyed and of thoo meruayllous thynges I ſhall tell you.
               ¶ Thys holy mayde was ſomme tyme in the Cyte of pyſe / herborowed in a worthy mannes hows of the ſame Cyte / the whiche man loued well this holy mayde.
               After tyme ſhe was ther a whyle / ſhe was gretely feblyd in body by ofte exceſſe of ſpyryt in rauyſhyng / ſo that as it ſemed mayſter Reymond and other moo that ſawe hyr. She was brought nye to ye deth / wherfore mayſter Reymond was fore aferde leſt ſhe ſholde haue dyed / he bethought hym what remedye he myght ordeyne for to reſtore hyr to lenger lyf / and he wyſt neuer what he myght ordeyne for hyr as for egges and wyne / and alſo other letuaryes he knewe welle that ſhe myght not ete. Thenne he came to hyr and prayed hyr that ſhe wolde receyue a lytell ſuker in hyr water that ſhe drynketh / to whome ſhe anſwerd thus.

Syr ſethe it is ſoo that we may not putte noo comfortable remedye wythin hyr body / lete vs▪ vſe ſomme remedye wythout on hyr body. Thenne ſayde the ſouerayne of the hows / that he had a lytell beſyde hys hows a neyghboure that hadde a veſſell of vernage / to whome he ſayde / he wolde ſende to for to haue a botell full therof / for he knewe well that he ſholde haue it full gladly. A meſſenger was ſent to hym / and tolde him how this holy mayde was feble / wherfore he praied in his mayſtrys behalf that he wold woucheſauf to ſende hyr a botell of vernage. To whome the neyghboure anſwerd thus that he wolde ſende hym all redy / but certeyn he ſayde hys veſſell was emptyd / and therfore he prayed hym to holde hym excuſed / for I wote well in all my hows is no drope of wyne / and that I am ryght ſory fore. Neuertheleſſe to be ſeker come and ſee / and thenne bere wytneſſe of the trouth to my frende as thou ſeeſt.
               Thenne forthwyth he took the meſſenger wyth him all ageynſt the meſſengers

wyll / and brought hym to hys wyne ſeler / and ſhewed hym that ſame veſſell of vernage / the whiche veſſell ſemed by outwarde tokenys that it was voyde many day afore / yet neuertheleſſe the good man dyd more for to ſee the trouthe that it was voyde / he drewe out the ſpygot / that was in the veſſell / and drewe it out in hys preſence / that he ſholde ſee that there was noo wyne Inne. As ſoone as he hadde done ſoo / the vernage came out and ranne vpon the grounde plentuouſly / he was ſore aſtonyed and ſtopped the veſſell ageyne / and callyd all hys meyne / and axed of them whether they hadde putte ony▪ wyne of vernage in that veſſell. All they ſayde naye / they knewe no wyne there in thre monthys a fore and more. And it hadde be a grete meruayll that wythoute them ony lyquor had be putte ther Inne.

                  rward notefyed to the neghboures aboute / and all they ſayde it was a myracle as it was The meſſenger came ageyne wyth a grete meruayll gladdenes bryngyng wyth hym a botell of vernage / and tolde all the myracle as it was / ſoo that all thoo that herde it thanked our lord that wrought ſuche a myracle in hys holy mayde Katheryne / and many one aftward whan this holy mayde was hole / came for to ſee hyr / ſeyeng wyth grete meruaylle ſuche wordes / how may this be that drynketh noo wyne by myracle. By ſuche wordes of the people / this holy mayde caught grete ſorowe in hir herte as ſhe knowleched afterward to mayſter Reymond. And wyth ſuche ſorowe and waylyng / ſhe prayed to our lord in hyr ſowle more thenne in hyr mouthe ſeyeng ſuche wordes: A good lord why ſuffreſt thou me to be ſo tormented in herte that I ſhall be to all folke ſhame and reproue. All other ſeruauntes of thyne may lyue among the people ſaue I allone. O good lord who axed of thy myldenes wyne.

Our lord of hys mercy herde hyr prayer and made the veſſell of wyne to decrece / ſo that ſodeynly ther it ſemed full to all mennes drynkyng the whiche drank therof of deuocyon by cauſe of the myracle it was decrecyd to the lyes / and ſo all tho that prayſed it afore for myracle / helde ther pe

                  s afterward for ſhame▪ And mayſter Reymond and other moo of hyr ghooſtly chyldren were aſhamed of theyr grete prayſyng afore. But the holy mayde was Jocunde and gladde thankyng our lord hyr ſpouſe that hadde delyuered hyr of ſuche open prayſyng of men.
               ¶ Now I praye you maydens taketh he de how oure lorde kepte this holy mayde from vayne glorye / and ſette hyr in a perfyte grounde of mekeneſſe by thyſe two myracles. By the fyrſt he gaue hyr mater to worſhyp him that wrought that myracle wythout hyr wetyng in that / that he fylled ye veſſell of wyne. By the ſecounde he gaue hyr mater to folowe hym in mekenes / in puttyng awaye of vayne glorye / the whiche was putte vpon hyr. By the fyrſt our lord ſhewed what vertue of myracle ſhe was endowed wyth By the ſecounde he ſhewed what wyſdome ſhe was fulfylled wyth. For there that mekenes is / there is wyſdom. Neuertheles yet the ſecoū
                  de myracle in emptyng of the veſſell was gretter thenne the fyrſt in fyllyng of the veſſell / & that ſemed well by a ſimylytude

that Saynt Gregorye makyth in hys dyaloges betwyne the vertue of pacyence & ſhewyng of myracles / whether he ſeyth that the vertue of pacyence paſſeth ſhewyng of myraclee. Why thenne may not the vertue of trewe mekenes / the whiche is neuer wythout wyſdom paſſe with out ony comparyſon ſhewyng of myracles / the whiche come as well by pryde as by mekenes. A beſtely man may in no wyſe perceyue this / and that is no meruaylle. For Saynt Poule ſayde that prudence of the fleſſhe is in no wyſe ſubiecte to god. Loo maydens now haue I tolde you what myracles our lord ſhewed by his ſpouſe Katheryne in vnlyfly creatures / and thus I make an ende of this chapytre The wytneſſe of this chapytre alſo ben expreſſyd afore wyth Inne this chapytre there that the myracles ben declared.
            
            
               ¶ Of the ofte receyuyng of the holy ſacrament of the aulter / and of the meruaylles whiche our lord dyd to hyr touchyng the holy ſacrament / and other relyques of ſayntes. Capitulum xij
               IT was knowen to all that knew this holy mayde whyle ſhe lyued in erthe / what excellent loue ſhe hadde in reuerence and deuocyon aboute the worſhypfull ſacrament of the aultre.
               Oure lorde hys fleſſhe and hys blood ſo that for the often receyuyng therof / hit was a comyn ſeyeng among the people that Katheryne the holy mayde was houſelyd euery day and lyued ther by allone wythout ony bodely mete. And all be it that they ſayd not alwaye trouthe / yet I ſuppoſe they tolde it mekely gyuynge honour to god that euer apperyth meruaylous to hys choſen Neuertheles be cauſe ſhe receyued it ſo ofte / all be it that it were not euery daye / yet ther were ſomme that grutched wyth all / ageynſt whome may be brought wytnes ynough of holy faders that they dyd the ſame. But fyrſt I ſhall tell you what the vſe was of holy chyrche in olde tyme. Saynt Denys ſeyth in a book that he made de eccleſiaſtica Jerarchia / that in the begynnyng of holy chyrche / the feruoure of the holy ghooſt was ſo haboundaunt in the hertes of feythfull creatures bothe men and wō
                  men / that they receyued the ſacramente of the aulter euery daye Furthermore the doctryne of holy chyrche techeth this / that euery feythfull man is bounde in no dedely ſynne yf he haue actuell deuocyon / it is not only lefull for hym / but alſo merytorye for to receyue that excellent worſhypfull ſacramente Whoo thenne durſt forbede ſuche a feythfull perſone and ſuche an holy lyuer in ony maner wiſe for to wynne ſo ofte grete mede in receyuyn
                     •…
                   of that worſhypfull ſacramente. Trewely I doubte not therof / but that ſuche a creature had grete wrong yf it be denyed whan it is mekely vxed. But yf they wolde ſay vtterly / that it is not lefull to no creature be he neuer ſo feythfull / ne neuer ſoo perfyte ne deuote for to receyue that blyſſed ſacramente ofte. To this I ſhall tell you what anſwere this holy mayde gaue to a byſſhop in preſence of mayſter Reymond that ſayd theſe wordes aforſayd to hyr. Alledgyng for hym the wordes of Saynt Auſtyn where he ſeyth thus. Euery day for to receyue the ſacrament of the aulter nother I prayſe ne blame it▪ to this obyeccyon anſwerde this holy mayde in this wyſe to the byſſhoppe. Fader yf Saynt Auſtyn blame it not. Ye alled

He anſwereth thus therto / that ofte receyuyng of that blyſſed ſacrament / encrecyth the deuocyon of hym that receyueth it / but it leſſyth other whyles hys reuerence that he ſholde haue to that blyſſed ſacramente.
               Therfore euery feythfull Cryſten man ſholde haue bothe reuerence and deuocyon to that blyſſed ſacramente And whan he feyleth that hys reuerence is leſſened by ofte receyuyng of that blyſſed ſacramente / he ſholde abſteyne a whyle / that he myght go therto afterward wyth more reuerence. And yf he fele hys reuerence euer hole and neuer leſſened / but

Thys holſom doctryne of this deuoute and holy doctoure Saynt Thomas kepte this holy mayde Katheryne For ofte tyme ſhe receyued that blyſſed ſacramente. And ſomme tyme ſhe abſteyned hyr ther fro. All be it that ſhe hadde euer deſyre to be knytte to hyr ſpouſe by medytacyon of the blyſſed ſacrament / for the brennyng charyte where by ſhe was drawe to hym / in ſo moche other whyle ſhe deſyred to be houſeled.
               That but ſhe hadde receyued that day whan ſhe deſyred that blyſſed ſacrament ſhe ſhold haue a paſſion of ſyknes in hir body / as though ſhe hadde be vexyd long tyme afore wyth a contynuell ſekenes of feuer / and all that ſykenes of the body came fro the paſſyon of the ſoule. Many tymes ſhe was thus vexed whanne ſhe was letted from houſelyng / other whyle by the Pryoure of the freres / and other whyle by the Pryoreſſe of theyr ordre of hir ſuſters. Neuertheles by cauſe ſhe ſholde not be lette / our holy fader the pope Gregorye the xj for hyr more comforte graunted hyr by bull that what preeſt h

               ¶ Of one meruayllous thyng now ſhall I tell you yt befyll to mayſter Reymond this holy maydes confeſſour. In a tyme whan mayſter Reymond came from Auyon to the Cyte of Sene / and thoughte to loke how this holy mayde ferde / he entred in to hyr hous aboute none dayes and founde hyr in hir oratorye. And this was on Saynt Markys day the Euangelyſt / as ſoone as ſhe ſawe hym ſhe roſe ageynſt hym and ſayd to hym theſe wordes. O wolde god fadre ye wyſt how hongry my ſoule is▪ Thenne mayſter Reymond anſwerd hyr / for he wyſt well ynough what ſhe mente. And ſayde moder it is now all moſt paſte tyme of ſyngyng / and I am ſoo wery that vnnethe I may dyſpoſe me to ſyng Wyth that ſhe helde hyr pees a lytell whyle. And ſoone after ſhe brack out ageyne the ſame wordes and ſayd / ſhe was ſore an hongred.
               Thenne mayſter Reymond wente to maſſe in hyr owne chapell that ſhe hadde by lycence of the pope / and ſayd maſſe of Saynt Marke. And whan he hadde vſed he torned for to gyue this mayde generall abſolucyon / as the maner of holy chirche axeth. He ſawe hyr face lyke the face of an angell ſendyng out bemys of bryghtneſſe / in ſoo moche that he meruaylled and ſayd in hym ſelf to ou

But certeyne lorde this is thy dere ſpouſe / wyth that he torned hym to the aulter / and ſayde thys wordes to oure lorde in hys ſoule. Come lorde to thy ſpouſe / anone as he had ſayd that in hys thought ſodeynly wyth the ſame thought / the oſte roſe vp hym ſelf and came to hys hondes
               ¶ Another meruayllous thynge of this blyſſed ſacramente I ſhall tell you / that befyll to the ſame mayſter Reymond. He was in a tyme in the Cyte of Sene for certeyne thynges that he hadde to done / and as ſoone as he hadde done / he wente for to ſpeke wyth this holy mayde and founde hyr ſyke of a ſykenes in hyr ſyde the whiche was callyd Ilica paſſio / and of other gret

                     •
                   of the aulter / he went home to hys Couent for to ſay maſſe And as he made hym redy to maſſeward / this holy mayde ſente to hym by a felawe of heres / and prayed him to abyde a whyle / for ſhe wolde be houſeled that day whan hyr ſykeneſſe were paſſyd awaye from hyr. He dyd ſo and abode hyr leyſyr tyll it was aboute none tyme / this holy mayde was eſyd and came to chirche for to be houſelyd. But hyr felawes conſydered that the tyme was late for to be houſeled / thenne by cauſe ſhe hadde it in cuſtome for to abyde afterward thre houres or foure to gyders in rauyſſhynge or more So that the chirche dores moſt all that tyme ſtooden open / of the whiche cuſtome many of the freres grutcheden / therfore they counſeylled hyr not for to be houſeled for grutchyng of ſomme of the freres. To the whiche counſeyll this holy mayde mekely and obedyently conc

               But for hyr grete deſyre that ſhe had to that blyſſed ſacramente / and myghte not receyue it ſhe prayed oure lorde deuoutely in the ferreſt place of the chirche / vnknowyng to mayſter Reymond that ſhe was come / and there ſhe prayed in this wyſe. Lorde Theſu endeles mercy as thou haſt gyue me gracyouſly this deſyre. Soo I beſeche the perfou

Thenne almyghty god that neuer deſpyſeth the deſyre of his ſeruauntes / herde hys ſpouſe Katheryne not onely mercyably. But alſo meruayllouſly as I ſhall tell you. Whan ſhe hadde comforte of oure forde / ſhe ſente to mayſter Reymond by one of hyr ſuſters and prayed hym to goo to maſſe whan it lyked hym / for ſhe myght nott be houſelyd that day.
               Thenne he wente to maſſe ſuppoſyng that ſhe hadde be at home at hyr hows / and not in the chyrche. And whan he hadde ſacred / and wolde make the fraccyon a fore Agnus dei in thre partys as holy chyrche hath ordeyned. Meruayllouſly as he wende to haue made iij partycles / he founde foure partycles.
               And that fourthe partycle ſkypped aboue the Chaleys and come doune be it ſelf / and layde it ſelf vpon the corporas / as it ſemed to mayſter Reymond. But he coude neuer fynde it afterward.
               For many tymes he ſought ther after bothe that ſame tyme / and alſo whanne maſſe was doune / wherfore he made grete ſorowe in hys hert

hym to aſke counſeyll of the pryour of ye place herof / the whiche pryour loued and dred our lorde god right moche / couering in the mene tyme the aulter that none body ſhold come there vnto the tyme he ſholde come agayn. But ſodenly as he was goyng to the pryour come to hym a ſpeciall frende of his a pryour of the chaterhous preyng hym he myght ſpeke wyth this holy mayde katheryne for certayne maters. Thenne Mayſter Reymoūd prayed hym for to abyde a lityll tyme tyll he hadde ſpoke wyth the pryour of his couent.

The fende beſyed hym that he myght fyrſt to remeue thys holy mayde awaye from hyr ſpouſe Jheſu / afterward to wythdrawe hir fully from hym. Or ellys at the laſte for to lette hyr / namely for a tyme / but ſhe wyth a myghty feruour fyrſt ouerthrewe hyr enemye the fende. Afterward by wytte and counſeyll of the holy ghooſt ouercome hym. At the laſt wyth ſtedefaſt vertue ſhamed hym / that was aboute to lette hyr. As for the fyrſt the fende began to remeue hyr fro hyr holy purpoſe Fyrſt by hyr ſuſter Bonauenture / the whiche was wedded curyoſyte of her here and clothys / as it is declared openly in the fourthe chapytre of the fyrſt partye.

Alſo mayſter Reymond of hyr beſyde all this as he was enfourmed of other that were trewe folke / that in a tyme whā ſhe prayed afore a crucifyxe of our lordes paſſyon / the fende ſtood afore hir hauyng in hys honde a clothe of ſylke / and was aboute to araye hyr wyth the ſame clothe The whiche Illuſyon of curyoſyte ſhe dyſpyſed and blyſſed hyr and torned hyr to the crucyfyxe. After that the fende vanyſſhed awaye / but yet he lefte in hyr mynde temptacyon of curyoſytre of clothyng. Thenne anone ſhe hadde myne of hir purpoſe of maydenhode / and ſpak to our lord in this wyſe. Dere lord and ſwete ſpouſe / thou knoweſt well that I deſyred neuer huſbonde but the Therfore I praye the helpe me that I may ouercome theſe temptacyons of curyoſyte by vertue of thyne holy name. I axe not lord / that thou ſholdeſt take them awaye fro me / but yt thou woucheſauf to gyue me the vyctorye of thy mercy. As ſoone as ſhe hadde ſayde theſe wordes. Our blyſſed Lady quene of maydens apperyd to hyr ſyght / ſemyng to hyr ſyght that ſhe took oute a ryght fayre clothe out of hyr ſones ſyde / wyth the whiche clothe ſhe arrayed hyr / And afterward ſhe ſayde to thys holy mayde thus▪ I do the well to wete doughter / that the clothes whiche comen oute of my ſones ſyde paſſen all other clothes in fayrnes and in beaute.

Neuertheleſſe ſomme ſhall I reherſe here in ſpecyall that ben not ſpoken of in the ſame chapytre.
               And all be it that ſomme thynges may not be reherſed here wythout ſhame of ſom Relygyous perſonys / the whiche were cō

Yet better it were that I reherſed them / thenne the gyftes of the holy ghooſt be hydde / where by ye maydens may haue loue and drede / bothe for to here ſuche treſpaſſes of ſuche Relygyous folke / and loue in ſeyeng of the vertue of pacyence in this holy mayde.
               This holy mayde Katheryne after tyme that ſhe hadde ſauoure and ſwetenes of deuocyon / ſhe myght neuer do dede of vertue openly wythout ſclaundre & bacbytyng of ſuche / namely that ſhe ſholde rather had fauoured hyr and comforted hyr therin / as ghooſtly lyuers bothe of Relygyous and ſeculerys / meruaylleth noothyng here of / for as I ſayde afore in the fyfthe chapytre of the ſecounde partye.

folke / bothe Relygyous and ſeculers / ſoo that by theyr counſeyll thys holy mayde was ofte tymes lette from hyr confeſſyon and hyr confeſſour / and alſo from receyuyng of the blyſſed ſacrament / and all this ſhe ſuffred pacyently wythout ony grutchyng or playnyng. Rather ſuppoſyng of them that ſo lette hyr / that they dyd it for an holy entente / and for the helthe of hyr ſoule / where fore hyr ſemed that ſhe was ye more bounde to praye for them not as for hyr enemyes / but as for hyr ſpecyall frendes. Yet aboue all this whan ſhe was other whyle ſuffred to be houſelyd / in receyuyng of ye blyſſed ſacrament of the aulter / they wolde not ſuffre hyr afterward to abyde long in prayer as ſhe was wonte to do / the whiche was to hyr vnpoſſyble / by cauſe ſhe receyued it wyth ſuche a paſſyng feruour of deuocyon / ſoo that euer ſoone after hyr ſpyryte was rauyſſhed fro hyr bodely wyttes / and ſo ſhe abode many houres to gydre / as it is declared afore in the ſeconde and in the laſte chapytre of the ſeconde partye As ſoone as ſhe was aſpyed in that wyſe / ſom that were dyſceyued by the forſayde ſuſters wolde come Inne and drawe hir out of the chyrche / where ofte tymes ſhe ſholde lye in the ſonne whan it was moſt hoteſt aboute mydde daye long tyme to gyders or thenne ſhe ceſſyd of hyr rauyſſhynge and reſtored to hyr bodely wyttes. And ther wyth wepyng and waylyng ſomme▪ of hir ſuſters that were vertuouſly ſtyred to grace kepte hyr tyll ſhe was reſtoryd.
               Alſo there came another man that came in a tyme and founde hyr lye there as a dede womman in rauyſſhyng / & wyth a grete angre he wente to hir and ſporlyd hyr wyth hys feet. And whanne ſhe was reſtoryd to hyr bodely wyttes ageyne / it was tolde hyr how ſhe was ferde wyth / yet ſhe wolde neuer blame hem therfore / but rather excuſe hem whan other ſpake euyll of hem. Neuertheles they were punyſſhed of our lorde full harde / and that was a grete ſorowe to hyr / ſaue ſhe durſt not long ſtryue ageynſt hys ryghtwyſneſſe. For in a tyme there was a lady / that hadde grete Indygnacyon of this holy mayde whan ſhe ſawe hyr in ſuche rauyſſhyng / wherfore ſhe came to hir and ſporlyd hyr wyth hyr feet. But as ſoone as ſhe was come home to hyr owne place / ſhe dyed wythout receyuyng of ony ſacrament. There was alſo another wretche that ſporled hir in the ſame wyſe / whā ſhe was ſoo rauyſſhed. And alſo was one of tho that one tyme bare hir out of the chyrche whan ſhe was ſoo rauyſſhed full vyolently / but he was punyſſhed afterward that I am a ferde to tell it. Thys wretchyd man was ſoo enuyous and ſoo odyous to thys blyſſed mayde / that not wythſtondyng alle the formeſt curſed dedys that he ſhewed to hyr / yet he was aboute in a tyme for to kylle hyr / and ther was no thynge that letted hym / but onely he hadde hyr not there he wold haue hir

By this maydens ye may knowe what vertue of pacyence this holy mayde hadde / and how pleaſaunt hyr dedys were to our lord / that ſo auengyd hir wronges vnknowyng to hyr.
               ¶ Alſo yet ſhall I reherſe to you by maner of recapytulacyon thre meruayllous thynges that be wryten in the fourthe chapytre yt of ſecounde partye / by the whiche thynges ye may conſydre that this holy mayde hadde paſſyngly the vertue of pacyence. As for the fyrſt it is wryten in the ſame chapytre of a leproſe womman that was called Secta lyeng in an hoſpytall / the whiche womman not onely lacked neceſſaryes but alſo a keper / for ther was none that wolde kepe hyr by cauſe of hyr lepre. Thys holy mayde herde here oft ſhe wente to hir and was to hyr a ſeruaunt / and ordeyned gladly for all that ſhe neded. Of this mynyſtracyon the ſyke leprous womman was proude / and ſtyred what ſhe coude this holy mayde wyth many Iniuryes reproues & ſclaundres puttyng ageynſt hyr▪ But yet this holy mayde was ſo armed wyth myghty pacyence that ſhe was noo thynge meued by hyr wordes / thenne the fende ſawe that he myght in noo wyſe meue hyr from hyr merytorye ſeruyce / he enfected and deſouled hyr hondes wyth the ſame lepre that the ſame leprous womman hadde / yet for that wolde ſhe not leue / but rather deſyred to be a lepre thenne for to leue hyr vnſeruyd And ſo ſhe contynued in hyr ſeruyce vnto the tyme ſhe hadde beryed that ſyke womman. And aftertyme ſhe was beryed / our lord by myracle clenſyd hyr from hyr lepre in hyr hondes. Charyte that is pacyence and benyngne taught hyr for to ouercome alle this. As for the ſeconde / there is alſo wryten in the ſame chapytre of another womman that is called Palmarya / the whiche was one of the ſuſtres of penaunce. I ſhall tell you this womman Palmarya was hyghly ſette in a wycked hate ageynſt this holy mayde / ſoo ferforthe that ſhe dyffamed hyr wretchedly / wherfore our lord gaf hyr fyrſt a ſykenes in hyr body. Afterward ſhe began to peryſſhe body and ſoule / ſo that ſhe myght not eſha

Alſo there was another ſuſter of penaūce / that was called Andrea as it is wryten in ye ſame chapytre / the whiche had in hyr breſt a foule ſtynkyng kancre / yt ther was neuer one yt wold minyſtre to hir for ſtenche Of this herde this holy mayde / & ſhe cam to ye ſyke wōman & ſerued hir gladly without ony ſqueymouſnes / in waſhyng & wypyng of hyr woūde / & whan ſhe felte in hyr ſelf ony maner ſqueymouſnes ſhe wold then put hyr noſe to ye woūde long tyme to gyds vnto ye tyme hir body defaylled / but ye lothenes went awaye ther by. Thenne ye fende Sathan entred in to ye ſyke ſuſter / & made hir to grutche with this holy mayde & for to haue hir in ſuſpeccion / & ſo wood ſhe was wyth hir yt ſhe ſclaūdred hir openly to hir ſuſters & ſayd that ſhe had ſynned fleſſhely and loſte hyr maydenhode.
               
                  ¶ Al be it that this hooly mayden and vyrgyn was heuy of this ſhlaunder: yet ſhe lefte neuer her ſeruyce to her / but ouer came by meke ſeruyſe and myghty pacy ence her malyce / and wente to prayer as for a ſouerayn remedye agaynſt ſuche accuſacions / at the laſte by grace of thys holy mayde and vyrgyns prayers and by ye merytes of her ſtronge paciēce / this ſeke ſuſter ſawe this holy mayde & vyrgyn in tyme of her prayers tranſformed a fore her in to a grete lyght that ſhe had therby grete comforte and repented here of her fals accuſacion Thā ſhe called this holy mayde and vyrgyr to her and aſked her forgyuenes af her curſed accuſacion & all other to whom ſhe had ſhlaundred her / ſhe ſent after and tolde theym that ſhe hadde falſely accuſed this hooly mayde and vyrgyn wherfore ſhe aſked theym forgyuenes / and thenne ſhe tolde theym what ſhe ſawe of this holy mayde and vyrgyn affermyng to theym all that ſhe was not only a pure mayde and virgyn but alſo an holy mayde and vyrgin Loo dere frendes there the fend wente to the fame this hooly mayde and vyrgyn by his malycious excitaciō / there he magnefyed her vertuous name alle agaynſte his wyll: yet all this oure reuerend lorde almyghty god by medytacion of the vertu of pacience that was in her / Thenne from that tyme forward this holy vyrgyns name encrecyd ſoo hyghely amonges the peple / that it come to the audyence of two popes whiche were in her tyme and many cardynals / 
               ¶ Ferthermore of another thinge I ſhal telle you the whiche is writen in the ſame chapyter of the ſame woman Andrea. It befell in a tyme whan this holy may de and vyrgyn waſſhyd and wyped her ſtynkyng wounde / The fende made her ſo ſkeymous that her ſtomake was meruey louſly ſteryd for to caſte wyth that ſhe aroos & ſaide to her ſefl thus Trewely wretche thou that art ſoo ſkaymous off thyne ſuſters ſykenes: leue it welle thou ſhalt receyue the fylte of her wounde with in thyn owne body / Thenne ſhe wente & wyſſhe that ſtynkyng wounde and receyued the fylthe that came ther fro in to a dyſſhe and went a ſyde and dranke it of The nexte nyght after our reuerend lord apperyd to her and ſayde: Doughter in this dede thou paſſyſt in myn ſyngh / And thou haſt therby pleaſyd me more than in ony werke that euer thou dedeſt And therfore by cauſe thou haſt doo ſoo merueylouſly a dede for my loue / I ſhal gyue the a merueylous drynke by the whiche thou ſhalt be hadde in grete merueyle amonge alle creatours wyth that as it ſemed to her he putt her mouthe to ye reuerend wounde of his ſwete blody ſyde / And ſayde doughter drynke ynongh of the drynke of myn ſyde that is merueylous and delectable bi the whiche not oonly thyn ſoule but thyn boody ſhal bee fulfylled the whiche thou haſt deſpiſed for myn loue / Fro that tyme forword her ſ
