for all Eſtates to looke in, wherein they may plainly ſee the iuſt rewarde, for
Vnſaciate and Abhominable Couetouſneſſe.
M.D.LXIX.
            
               ACcordyng to my cuſtom, daily I did muſe,
               Vpon Gods holy worde, which for euer ſhall endure,
               I thought it the beſt exerciſe that any man could vſe,
               Daily to be frequented in the Scripture,
               The .xii. of Luke I beheld a place both plaine and pure,
               Geuing generall warning in ſaying theſe wordes to vs,
               Beware of Couetouſneſſe, ſaith Chriſt Ieſus.
            
            
               It firſt confounded Adam being then in Paradice,
               Coueting to be as God, and ſo began to ſlide,
               He preſumed to haue knowledge, and alſo to be wiſe,
               Not contented with his ſtate, nor therin did abide,
               His coueting (Alas) ſet him cleane beſide,
               Regarding Sathans wordes which coueted his tranſgreſſion
               Couetouſly he preſumed, to be his own confuſion,
            
            
               The roote of all euill it is, as witneſſeth the Scripture,
               An odious and ſecret miſcheif, as any man can ſow,
               For what Bloſſom or bud, thinke ye that can proſper,
               Or what Flower or Fruite, did euer man ſe grow,
               But a roote it muſt haue firſt, this full wel we know,
               Beware therfore of it, for this I do confeſſe,
               The originall of all ſin, muſt needes be couetouſneſſe,
            
            
               Of all ſin couetouſeneſſe, firſt poluted Adam,
               Linked with infidelitie, Pride, and diſobedience,
               Which peſtiferous ſin, dwelleth almoſt in euery man,
               For lacke of grace, conſtancy, and good intelligence,
               So we like Adams children, forgetting our obedience,
               Seking our deſtruction, without cauſe or reward,
               Like Achab, and Iezabell, coueting Nabothes vineyard.
            
            
               Thus couetouſneſſe ſlew Naboth againſt all right,
               The nature of it is ſuch, it neuer was founde good,
               Wo be to the couetouſneſſe thou wofull wight,
               That without all mercy, ſo canſt thirſt for bloud,
               Thou broughteſt the generall Deluge at Noes Flud,
               And Gehezie by couetouſnes, if ye herken to this ſonge,
               Became a foule Lipper, euen all his life longe.
            
            
               King Dauid by couetouſneſſe deceyued was,
               And by concupiſcence the ſtory doth teſtify,
               In coueting the onely wife of Vrias,
               Greatly offended Gods deuine maieſty,
               But reproued by Nathan, wept and cried bitterly,
               Serche now the ſcripture, and do what you can,
               For nothing is founde worſe, then a couetous man.
            
            
               He that delighteth in couetouſnes, hath his ſoule to ſell,
               Thus ſaith Sirach, to ſuch as they are,
               Chriſt by Iuſtice muſt condempne ſuch to hell,
               As maketh Marchandice of any ſuch ware,
               The couetous man doth alwaies both ſcrape and ſpare,
               Still to ſatiſfie, but his greedie deſire,
               Which at laſt ſhall bring him to vnquenchable fier.
            
            
               In gathering therfore of Riches, be not to bolde,
               For with aſſurance they are but as dunge,
               For when many ſinnes are waren olde,
               Then Couetouſneſſe will ſeeme moſt yonge,
               This my Pen vttereth in ſteede of my tunge,
               The children of the couetous beyng ſtoute and braue,
               Daily wiſheth in their harts, to ſe there fathers graue.
            
            
               Locke not in thy breaſt this ſinfull couetouſnes,
               Foſter it not vp, for any flattering fees:
               Beware and be not nurce to ſuch wickednes,
               Leaſt thou be founde as a Droane amonge Bees,
               Not eſteemed in common wealth, but as rotten trees,
               Worthy to be brent where euer that thou dwell,
               According to Gods prouidence, fier brandes in Hell,
            
            
               Herod the kinge coueted to 
                     •
                  lea the onely Lorde,
               Reſiſting thereby his only ſaluation,
               As too manie there be that hateth Gods worde,
               And ſhall therefore receiue dampnation,
               The ſecond of Mathewe maketh declaracion,
               How Herode coueted a kingdom not permanent,
               And therfore ſlew many a yonge Innocent.
            
            
               Some coueteth to bie both houſe and lande,
               But hoſpitalitee they will none keepe,
               For Couetouſneſſe taketh cruell thinges in hande,
               Deuouring the poore as the Wolfe doth the ſheepe,
               In ſecuritie of ſinne, they are rockt faſt a ſleape,
               Night and day caringe for thinges that be vaine,
               But wotteth not who ſhalbe lorde of al his trauel & paine
            
            
               Sainct Barnards Chariot they will ride in,
               Wherin let them continew and dwell:
               Which named is Securitie of vice and ſin,
               Leading them poaſt to the Deuill of Hell,
               For ſuch myzers haue their ſoules to ſell,
               Foure wheeles it hath to carie on the ſame,
               Of all which foure I will ſhew you the name.
            
            
               The firſt whéele is called Gredie deſire,
               Ingratitude, and contempt of God for other twaine,
               And forgetfulneſſe of Death, therto they require,
               Which foure wheeles do continew and remaine,
               To the Charet of Auarice which is led certaine,
               By three ſtrong horſes which runneth forth the race,
               Named, paſt ſhame, paſt repentaunce, and paſt grace.
            
            
               To this Chariot, a careleſſe Carter they muſt haue,
               Whoſe name is called Neuer contente,
               His whip in his hande, like a cruell ſlaue:
               With two ſtringes called wilful paine, & reſtleſſe tormēt
               Theſe are ordeyned for euerlaſting puniſhment,
               To belong to this Chariot, for their negligence,
               To carie away couetous perſons frō good mens preſence
            
            
               This Chariot of Auarice with his horſes ſo fell,
               Daily is ſet a worke to to in many a place:
               But whether goeth this Chariot I pray you now tell,
               Some thinke to Sathan to be reſident in place,
               Caried away by violence from all mercy and grace,
               To follow the generacion of vngodly ſtore,
               Neuer to haue mercy nor ſe light any more,
            
            
               Seing couetouſneſſe doth rob vs of mercie and grace,
               B
                     •
                  ing the roote of all ſinne and wickedneſſe,
               Let vs remember whilſt we haue ſpace,
               Calling to god to be our righteouſneſſe,
               To ayde and ſuccour vs, in all diſtreſſe,
               And now to couet his euerlaſting preſence,
               With him to raigne for euer when we depart hence,
            
            
               What is the cauſe of both ſacralige and Simony,
               I will now declare and manifeſtly expreſſe,
               And ſhew the iniciation of deteſtable vſery,
               Now being compelled the truth to confeſſe,
               The origenall of both is very couetouſneſſe,
               Likewiſe of Bankeroutes and Informers as I here tell,
               Couetouſneſſe lately inuented by Sathans counſell,
