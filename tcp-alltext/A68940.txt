            ¶ W. T. vnto the Reader.
            
               HEre thou haſt (mooſt deare reader) the new Teſtamēt or covenaunt made wyth vs of God in Chriſtes bloude. Which I have looked over agayne (now at the laſt) with all dylygence / and compared it vnto the Greke / and have weded oute of it many fautes / which lacke of helpe at the begynninge and overſyght / dyd ſowe therin. If ought ſeme chaunged / or not all to gether agreynge with the Greke / let the fynder of ye faute conſider the Hebrue Phraſe or maner of ſpeche lefte in the Greke wordes. Whoſe preterperfectence and preſenttence is ofte both one / and the futuretence is the optative mode alſo / and the future tence is ofte the imperatyve mode in the actyve voyce / and in the paſſyve ever. Lykewyſe perſon for perſon / nombre for nombre / and an interroga
                  •
               ion for a cō
               dicionall / and ſoche lyke is with the Hebrues a comen vſage.
            I have alſo in manye places ſet lyght in the mergent / to vnderſtonde the text by. If anye man fynde fautes ether with the trāſlacion or ought beſyde (which is eaſyer for manye to do / then ſo well to have tranſlated it them ſelves of their awne pregnant wyttes / at the begynnynge withoute foren ſample) to the ſame it ſhalbe lawfull to trāſlate it them ſelves and to put what they luſt therto. If I

ſhall perceave ether by my ſelfe or by the informacion of other / that ought be eſcaped me / or myght be more playnlye tranſlated / I will ſhortlye after / cauſe it to be mended. Howbe it in manye places / me thynketh it better to put a declaracyon in the margent / then to run in to farre from the text. And in manye places / where the text ſemeth at the fyrſt choppe harde to be vnderſtonde / yet ye circūſtāces before and after / and offē readinge together / maketh it playne ynough. & ce.
            Moreover / becauſe the kyngedome of heaven / which is the ſcripture & worde of God / maye be ſo locked vp / that he which readeth or heareth it / cannot vnderſtonde it: as Chriſt teſtifieth how that the Scribes and Phariſes had ſo ſhut it vp. Mat. xxiii. and had taken awaye the keye of knowledge. Luke. xi. that their Iewes which thought them ſelves with in / were yet ſo locked out / and are to this daye that they can vnderſtonde no ſentence of the ſcripture vnto their ſalvacion / though they can reherſe the textes every where & diſpute therof as ſottelye as ye popyſhe doctoures of dunces darcke learninge / which with their ſophiſtrye / ſarved vs / as ye Phariſes dyd the Iewes. Therfore (that I myght be founde faythfull to my father & lorde in diſtributinge vnto my brethrē & felowes of one fayth / their due & neceſſarye fode: ſo dreſſinge it & ceaſoninge it / that the weake ſtomackes maye receave it alſo / and be ye better for it) I thought it my dutye (moſt deare reader) to warne the

before / & to ſhew the the right waye in / & to geve the ye true keye to opē it withall / & to arme the agaynſt falſe Prophetes & malicious ypocrytes / whoſe perpetuall ſtodye is to leven the ſcripture with gloſes / and there to locke it vp where it ſhuld ſave thy ſoule / and to make vs ſhote at a wronge marke / to put oure truſt in thoſe thinges that proffit their belyes onlye and ſlee oure ſoules.
            The ryght 
                  〈…〉
                the onlye waye to vnderſtonde the ſcripture vnto oure ſalvacion / is / that we erneſtlye & aboue all thinge / ſerche for the profeſſion of oure baptyme or covenaū
               tesThe ryght waye into the ſcripture. made betwene God & vs. As for an enſample: Chriſt ſayth Mat. v. Happie are the mercifull / for they ſhall obtayne mercie. Loo / Here God hath made a covenaūt with vs / to be mercifull vnto vs / yf we wilbe mercifull one to another: ſo that the man which ſheweth mercie vnto his neyboure / maye be bolde to truſt in God for mercie at all nedes. And contrarye wyſe / indgemēt without mercie / ſhalbe to him that ſheweth not mercye. Iaco. ii. So now / yf he yt ſheweth no mercie / truſt in God for mercie / his fayth is carnall & worldlye / & but vayne preſumpciō. For God hath promyſed mercie onlye to ye mercifull. And therfore the mercileſſe have no Godes worde yt they ſhall have mercie: but contrarye wyſe / yt they ſhall have iudgemēt without mercie. And Mat. vi. If ye ſhall forgeve men their fautes / youre hevē
               ly father ſhall forgeve you: but & yf ye ſhall not forgeve mē their fautes / no more ſhall youre

 father forgeve you youre fautes. Here alſo by ye vertue & ſtrēght of this covenaūt wher with God of his mercie hath boūde him ſelfe to vs vnworthie / maye he yt forgeveth his neyboure / be bolde when he returneth & amēdeth to beleve & truſt in god for remiſſion of whatſoever he hath done amyſſe. And cōtrarye wyſe / he that will not forgeve / cannot but diſpeare of forgevenes in the ende / and feare iudgement without mercie.
            The generall covenaūt wherin all other are cōprehended & included / is this. If we meke oure ſelves to god / to kepe all his lawes / after the enſample of Chriſt: then God hath bounde him ſelfe vnto vs to kepe and make good all the mercies promyſed in Chriſt / thorow out all the ſcripture.
            All the whole lawe which was gevē to vtter oure corrupt nature / is cōprehended in theLawe. ten commaundements. And ye ten commaundementes are comprehended in theſe two: love God and thy neyboure. And he that loveth his neyboure in God and Chriſt / fulfilleth theſe two / & conſequentlye the ten / & finally all the other. Now if we love oure neyboures in God & Chriſt: that is to wete / if we be lovinge / kynde & mercifull to them / becauſe God hath created them vnto his lyknes / & Chriſt hath redemed them & bought them wt his bloude / then maye we be bolde to truſt in God thorow Chriſt & his deſervinge / for all mercie. For God hath promyſed and bounde him ſelfe to vs: to ſhew vs all mercie / & to be a

father almighty to vs / ſo that we ſhall not nede to feare the power of all oure adverſaryes.
            Now yf anye man that ſubmitteth not him ſelfe to kepe the cōmaundemētes / do thinke yt he hath anye fayth in God: the ſame mānes fayth is vayne / worldlye / damnable / develiſhe & playne preſumpcion as it is above ſayde / & is no fayth that can iuſtifie or be accepted before God. And that is it that Iames meaneth in his Piſtle. For how can a man beleve ſayth Paul without a preacher. Ro. x. Now reade all the ſcripture and ſe where God ſent anye to preache mercye to anye / ſave vnto thē onlye that repēt & turne to god with all their hartes / to kepe his commaundementes. Vnto the diſobedient that will not turne / is threatened wrath / vengeaunce and damnacion / accordinge to all the terrible curſes and fearfull enſamples of the Byble.
            Fayth now in God the father thorow oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt / accordinge to ye covenaū
               tes & apoyntemēt made betwene God & vs / is oure ſalvaciō. Wherfore I have ever noted ye covenaūtes in ye mergētes / & alſo ye promiſes. Moreover where thou findeſt a promyſe & no covenaunt expreſſed therewith / there muſt thou vnderſtonde a covenaūt. For all the promyſes of ye mercie & grace yt Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs / are made vpon ye condicion yt we kepe ye lawe. As for an enſample: whē the ſcripture ſayth. Mat. xii. Axe & it ſhalbe geven you: ſeke & ye ſhall fynde: knocke & it ſhalbe opened vnto you. It is to be vnderſtonde / if

that whē thy neyboure axeth / ſeketh or knocketh to ye / thou then ſhew him the ſame mercie which thou deſyreſt of god / then hath god boūde him ſelfe to helpe ye agayne / & elſe not.
            Alſo ye ſe that two things are requyred to begin a Chriſten man. The fyrſt is a ſtedfaſt fayth & truſt in almightie God / to obtayne all the mercie that he hath promyſed vs / thorow the deſervinge & merites of Chriſtes bloude onlye / withoute all reſpect to oure awne workes. And the other is / that we forſake evell & turne to God / to kepe his lawes & to fyght agaynſt oure ſelves and oure corrupte nature perpetuallye / that we maye do the will of god every daye better and better.
            This have I ſayde (moſt deare reader) to warne the / leaſt thou ſhuldeſt be deceaved / & ſhuldeſt not onlye reade the ſcriptures in vayne & to no proffit / but alſo vnto thy greater dā
               nacion. For the nature of Gods worde is / yt
               What the nature of gods worde is whoſoever reade it or heare it reaſoned & diſputed before him / it will begynne ymmediatlye to make him every daye better & better / till he be growē into a perfect mā in the knowledge of Chriſt and love of the lawe of God: or alſe make him worſe & worſe / till he be hardened that he openly reſiſt the ſprite of God / & then blaſpheme / after the enſample of Pharao / Cora / Abiron / Balam / Iudas / Symon Magus and ſoche other.
            This to be even ſo / the wordes of Chriſt Ioh. iii. do well confyrme. This is condemnaciō (ſayth he) the lyght is come into ye worlde

 / but ye men loved darcknes more then light for their dedes were evell. Beholde / when the light of Godes worde cometh to a mā / whether he reade it or here it preached & teſtified / & he yet have no love thereto / to faſſion his lyfe therafter / but cōſēteth ſtill vnto his olde dedes of ignoraūce: then beginneth his iuſt dā
               nacion ymmediatlye / & he is henceforth without excuſe: in that he refuſed mercie offered him. For God offereth him mercie vpon the condyciō that he will mende his livinge: but he will not come vnder the covenaūt. And frō that houre forwarde he waxeth worſſe & worſſe / God takinge his ſprite of mercye and grace from him for his vnthankfulnes ſake.
            And Paul wryteth. Ro. i. that the hethē becauſe when they knew god / they had no luſt to honoure him with godly lyvinge / therfore god powred his wrath vpon them & toke his ſpirite frō thē & gave them vp vnto their hertes luſtes to ſerve ſinne / frō iniquite to imquitie tyll they were thorow herdened and paſt repentaunce.
            And Pharao / becauſe when the worde of god was in his contre and gods people ſcattered thorow out all his land / and yet nether loved them or it: therfore god gave him vp / and in takynge his ſpirite of grace from him ſo hardened his herte with covetouſnes / that afterward no myracle coulde convert him.
            Here to pertayneth the parable of the talentes. Mat. xxv. The Lorde cōmaundeth ye talent to be takē awaye from the evell & ſlouthfull

ſervaunt & to binde him hand & fote & to caſt him into vtter darcknes / & to geve the talent vnto him that had ten / ſayenge: to all yt have / moare ſhalbe gevē. But frō him yt hath not / that he hath ſhalbe takē from him. That is to ſaye / he that hath a good harte toward ye worde of God / & a ſet purpoſe to faſſiō his dedes thereafter & to garniſhe it with Godly lyvinge & to teſtifie it to other / the ſame ſhall increaſe more & more dayly in ye grace of Chriſt. But he that loveth it not / to lyve therafter & to edifie other / the ſame ſhall looſe the grace of true knowledge & be blinded agayne and every daye ware worſſe and worſſe and blinder & blinder / till he be an vtter enemye of the worde of God / & his harte ſo hardened / that it ſhalbe impoſſible to convert him.
            And Luk. xii. The ſervaunt that knoweth his maſters will & prepareth not him ſelfe / ſhalbe beatē with many ſtripes: that is / ſhall have greater damnacion. And Matt. vii. all that here the worde of God & do not therafter bylde on ſande: that is / as the foundaciō layed on ſande cānot reſiſt violence of water / but is vnderminded & over throwen / even ſo ye fayth of them that have no luſt ner love to ye lawe of god buylde vpon the ſande of their awne ymaginacions / and not on the rocke of godes worde accordinge to his covenaūtes / turneth to deſperacion in tyme of tribulacion & when god cometh to iudge.
            And the vyneyarde Matt. xxi. planted and hyred oute to the huſbandmē yt wolde not rē
               der

 to the Lorde / of the frute in due tyme / and therfore was takē from them and hyred oute to other / doth confirme the ſame. For Chriſt ſayth to the Iewes / ye kyngdome of hevē ſhalbe taken frō you & gevē to a nacion that will bring forth the frutes therof as it is come to paſſe. For the Iewes haue loſt the ſpirituall knowledge of god & of his cōmaundementes and alſo of all the ſcripture / ſo yt they can vnderſtōde nothynge godlye. And ye dore is ſo locked vp that all their knockynge is in vayne / though manye of them take great payne for godes ſake. And luke. xiii. the fygge tree that beareth no frute is cōmaūded to be plucked vp
            And finally / hereto pertayneth with infinite other / the terrible parable of the vncleane ſpirite (Luke. xi.) which after he is caſt oute / when he cometh & fyndeth his houſe ſwepte and garnyſſhed / taketh to him ſeuen worſſe then him ſelfe / and cometh and entreth in & dwelleth there / & ſo is the ende of ye man worſe then the begynnynge. The Iewes / they had clenſed thē ſelves wt gode worde / frō all outward ydolatrye & worſhippinge of ydole. But their hertes remayned ſtill faythleſſe to godwarde and towarde his mercie and truthe and therfore without loue alſo and luſt to his lawe & to their neyboures for his ſake / & thorow falſe truſt in their awne worke) to which hereſie / the childe of perdicion / the wycked byſſhope of Rome wt his lawyers hath brought vs chriſten) were more abhominable ydolaters then before / and become ten tymes worſe

in the ende then at the begynnynge. For the fyrſt ydolatre was ſone ſpyed and eaſie to be rebuked of ye prophetes by the ſcripture. But the later is more ſotle to begyle withall / and an hundred tymes of more dyfficul
                  ••
                to be weded oute of mennes hertes.
            This alſo is a concluſion / nothynge more certayne / or more proued by ye teſtimonye & enſamples of ye ſcripture: yt if anye yt fauoureth the worde of God / be ſo weke yt he cānot chaſt his fleſhe / him will ye lorde chaſtice & ſcourge euery daye ſharper & ſharper / wt trybulacyon & myſfortune / yt nothynge ſhall proſpere wt him but all ſhall go agaynſt him / whatſoeuer he taketh in hande / & ſhall vyſet him wt pouertie / with ſyckneſſes & deſeaſes / & ſhall plage him with plage vpon plage / eche more lothſome / terryble and fearfull then other / tyll he be at vtter defyaunce with his fleſhe.
            Let vs therfore yt have now at this tyme oure eyes opened agayne thorow ye tēder mercie of God / kepe a meane. Let vs ſo put oure truſt in ye mercy of god thorow chriſt / yt we knowe it oure dutie to kepe ye lawe of God & to loue oure neyboures for their fathers ſake which created thē & for their lordes ſake which redemed thē & bought thē ſo derely wt his bloude Let vs walke in ye feare of God / & have oure eyes opē vnto both partes of Godes couenaū
               tes / certified that none ſhalbe partaker of the mercie / ſaue he that will fyght agynſt ye fleſſhe / to kepe ye lawe. And let vs arme oure ſelues wt this remēbraūce / that as chriſtes workes

 iuſtifie frō ſynne & ſet vs in ye fauoure of god / ſo oure awne dedes thorow workynge of ye ſpirite of God / helpe vs to cōtynew in ye fauoure & ye grace / into which chriſt hath brought vs / & that we cā no lenger cōtynew in fauoure & grace thē oure herte are to kepe the lawe.
            Furthermore cōcernynge ye lawe of God / this is a generall cōcluſiō / yt ye whole lawe
                  •
                whether they be ceremonies / ſacrifices / ye or ſacramētꝭ ether / or preceptꝭ of equitie betwene man & mā thorowout all degrees of ye worlde / all were geuē for oure proffyt & neceſſyte onlye / & not for anye nede yt God hath of oure kepynge thē / or yt his ioye is encreaſed therby or yt ye dede / for ye dede it ſelfe doth pleaſe him That is all yt God requyreth of vs when we be at one wt him & do put oure truſt in him &Loue is the fullinge of the lawe loue him / is yt we loue euery mā his neyboure to pitie him & to have cōpaſſyon on him in all his nedꝭ & to be mercifull vnto him. This to be euen ſo / chriſt teſtifieth. Mat. vii. ſayenge: this is ye lawe & ye prophets. That is / to do as thou woldeſt be done to (accordynge I meane to ye doctryne of ye ſcripture) & not to do that thou woldeſt not haue done to the / is all that the lawe requyreth & the Prophetꝭ. And Paule to the Roma. xiii. affyrmeth alſo the loue is the fullfyllinge of ye lawe / & that he which loueth / doth of his awne accorde all that the lawe requyreth. And .i. Timo. i. Paul ſayth yt ye loue of a pure hert & good cōſcience & fayth vnfayned is ye ende & fullfillynge of ye lawe. For fayth vnfayned in chriſts bloude cauſeth

to loue for chriſtes ſake. Which loue is ye pure loue onlye & ye onlye cauſe of a good cōſcience. For then is ye cōſcyence pure / when ye eye loketh to chriſt in all hir dedꝭ / to do them for his ſake & not for hir awne ſynguler aduauntage or anye other wycked purpoſe. And Ihō both in his goſpell & alſo piſtles / ſpeketh neuer of anie other lawe thē to loue one another purely / affyrmynge yt we haue God him ſelfe dwellynge in vs and all that God deſyreth / if we loue one the other.
            Seinge then that fayth to God & loue & mercifullnes to oure neyboures / is all that ye lawe requyreth / therfore of neceſſite the lawe muſt be vnderſtōde & interprete by thē. So yt all inferiour lawꝭ are to be kept & obſerued as longe as they be ſeruaūtꝭ to fayth & loue: and then to be broken ymedyatlye / if thorow anye occaſyon / they hurte ether ye fayth which we ſhuld have to godward in the confidence of chriſtes bloude or the loue which we owe to oure neyboures for Chriſtes ſake.
            And therfore when ye blynde phariſes murmured & grudged at him & his deſciples / that they brake ye ſaboth daye & tradycions of the elders / & that he him ſelfe dyd eate wt publicās & ſynners / he anſwereth. Mat. ix. allegynge Eſaias ye prophet: go rather & learne what this meaneth / I requyer mercie & not ſacrifyce. And Mat. xii. Oh yt ye wyſt what this meaneth / I requyer mercie & not ſacrifice. For onlye loue & mercifullnes vnderſtōdeth ye lawe / & elſe nothinge. And he that hath not yt

               
writtē in his harte / ſhall neuer vnderſtōde ye lawe / no: though all ye āgells of heuē wēt aboute to teache him. And he that hath that grauē in his harte / ſhall not only vnderſtōde ye lawe but alſo ſhall do of his awne inclinacion all that is required of ye lawe / though neuer laweLoue onlye vnderſtondeth ye law. had beē gevē: as all mothers do of thē ſelves without lawe vnto their childrē / all that can be reqvyred by anye lawe / loue ouercomynge all payne / greffe / tedyouſneſſe or lothſomnes: & euē ſo no doute if we had cōtynewed in oure fyrſt ſtate of innocēcie / we ſhuld euer haue fullfilled ye lawe / without cōpulſiō of ye lawe
            And becauſe the lawe (which is a doctryne thorow teachynge euery mā his dutye / doth vtter oure corrupt nature) is ſufficiētly deſcribed by Moſes / therfore is lytle mēcion made therof in the new teſtamēt / ſave of love only wherin all ye lawe is included / as ſeldome mē
               cion is made of ye new teſtamēt in the olde lawe / ſave here & there are promyſes made vnto them / yt Chriſt ſhuld come & bleſſe thē & delyuer thē / & yt the goſpell & new teſtamēt ſhuld be preached and publyſſhed vnto all nacions.
            The goſpell is glad tydynges of mercie &Goſpell. grace & yt oure corrupt nature ſhalbe healed agayne for chriſtes ſake & for ye merites of his deſeruingꝭ onlye: Yet on yt condiciō yt we will turne to God / to lerne to kepe his lawes ſpiritually / yt is to ſaye / of loue for his ſake / & wyll alſo ſoffre the curynge of oure infirmyties.
            The new teſtamēt is as moche to ſaye as aNew teſtament. new couenaūt. The olde teſtamēt is an olde tēporall couenaūt made betwene God & ye carnall

 childrē of Abraham / Iſaac & Iacob other wiſe called Iſrael / vpō ye dedes & ye obſeruynge of a tēporall lawe. Where ye rewarde of ye kepynge is tēporall lyfe & proſperyte in ye lande of Chanaan / & ye breakynge is rewarded wt tēporall deeth & punyſhmēt. But ye new teſtament is an euerlaſtynge couenaūt made vnto the childrē of God thorow fayth in chriſt / vpō the deſervynge of chriſt. Where eternall lyfe is promyſed to all that beleve / & death to all that are vnbeleuynge. My dedꝭ if I kepe the lawe are rewarded wt the tēporall promyſe of this lyfe. But if I beleue in chriſt / chriſtes dedes haue purchaſed for me the eternall promyſe of the euerlaſtynge lyfe. If I commyt nothynge worthye of deeth / I deſerue to my rewarde that no mā kyll me: if I hurte no mā I am worthye that no mā hurte me. If I helpe my neyboure / I am worthie that he helpe me agayne. &c. So that wt outward dedes wt which I ſerue other mē / I deſerue that other men do lyke to me in this worlde: & they extē
               de no further. But chriſtꝭ dedꝭ extende to lyfe euerlaſtynge vnto all that beleue &ce. This be ſoffyciēt in this place cōcernynge ye lawe & the goſpell / new teſtamēt and olde: ſo that as there is but one God / one chriſt / one fayth & one baptime / euē ſo thou vnderſtōde that there is but one goſpell / though manye wryte it & manye preache it. For all preache the ſame Chriſt & brynge the ſame glad tydynges. And therto paules piſtles wt ye goſpell of Iohn & his fyrſt epiſtle & the fyrſt epiſtle of ſaynt peter / are moſt pure goſpell & mooſt playnlye &

rychlye deſcribed the glorye of the grace of chriſt: Yf ye requyer more of the lawe / ſeke in the prologe to the romayns and in other places where it is ſofficientlye intreated of.
            
               ¶ Repentaunce.
               COncernynge this worde repētaunce or (as they vſed) penaūce / ye hebrue hath in ye olde teſtamēt generally (Sob) turne or be cōuerted. For which ye trāſlacion that we take for ſaynt Ieromes hath moſt parte (cōuerti) to turne or be cōuerted / & ſome tyme yet (agere penitenciā) And ye greke in the new teſtamēt hath perpetually (Metanoeo) to turne in the heart & mynde / & to come to ye ryght knowledge / & to a mannes ryght wyt agayne. For which (Metanoeo) S. Ieromes trāſlaciō hath: ſometyme (ago penetēciā) I do repēt: ſometyme (peniteo) I repēt: ſomtyme (penitror) I am repētaunt: ſomtyme (habeo penitenciā) I have repētaunce: ſome tyme (penitet me) it repēteth me. And Eraſmus vſeth moche this worde (reſipiſco) I come to my ſelfe or to my ryght mynde agayne. And the verye ſens and ſignificaciō both of the hebrue & alſo of ye greke worde / is / to be cōuerted & to tourne to God with all the hert / to knowe his will & to lyue accordynge to his lawes / & to be cured of oure corrupt nature wt the oyle of his ſpirite & wyne of obedyēce to his doctryne. Which cōuerſion or turnynge if it be vnfayned / theſe foure do accompanye it & are included therin: Confeſſion / not in the preſtes eare / for that is but mānes invēcion / but to God in ye hert & before

all the cōgregacion of God / how yt we be ſynners & ſynfull / & yt oure hole nature is corrupt & inclyned to ſynne & all vnryghteouſnes / and therfore euell / wycked & damnable / & his lawe holy & Iuſt / by which oure ſynfull nature is rebuked: & alſo to oure neyboures / if we have offended anye perſon perticularlye. Then contricion / ſorowfullnes that we be ſoche / damnable ſynners / & not onlye have ſynned but are holye inclyned to ſyne ſtill. Thirdlye fayth (of which oure olde doctoure have made no mēcion at all in ye deſcripciō of their penaūce) yt God for chriſte ſake doth forgeue vs & receave vs to mercie / & is at one wt vs & will heale oure corrupte nature. And fourthlye ſatiſfaciō or amendꝭ makynge / not to god wt holye workes / but to my neyboure whome I haue hurt / & the congregaciō of God whome I have offended (yf anye open cryme be foūde in me) & ſubmyttynge of a mās ſelfe vnto ye congregacion or church of chriſt / & to ye offycers of the ſame / to have his lyfe corrected & governed hence forth of thē / accordynge to the true doctryne of ye church of chriſt. And note this: that as ſatiſfaction or amendeſ makynge is counted ryghteouſnes before ye worlde & a purgynge of the ſynne: ſo yt the worlde when I haue made a full amendꝭ / hath no further to cō
                  playne. Even ſo fayth in chriſtes bloude is counted ryghteouſnes and a purgynge of all ſinne before God.

And as ye ſynne cōmytted agaynſt his brother / is pourged before ye world wt makynge amendꝭ or axynge forgeuenes / euen ſo is ye ſynne commytted agaynſt God / pourged thorow fayth in chriſtes bloude onlye. For chriſt ſayth. Io. viii. except ye beleue that I am he / ye ſhall dye in youre ſynnes.

Oute of which cuſtome paule in his epiſtle & alſo peter / call ye prelates & ſpirituall gouerners which are byſſhopes & preſtes / elders. Now whether ye call them elders or preſtes / it is to me all one: ſo yt ye vnderſtonde yt they be offycers & ſeruaūtes of the worde of God / vnto the which all men both hie & lowe that will not rebell agaynſt Chriſt / muſt obeye as longe as they preache & rule trulye & no lenger.

Luke. v) was one of chriſte apoſtles / and was with chriſt all the tyme of his preachynge / and ſawe and heard his awne ſelfe almoſt all that he wrote.
               
                  ¶ Marke
                  OF Marke reade (actes xii) how peter (after he was looſed oute of pryſon by the angell) came to Markꝭ mothers houſe / where manye of ye deſciples were prayenge for his delyueraūce. And paul & Barnabas toke him wt thē frō Ieruſalem & brought him to Antioche / actꝭ .xii. And actꝭ .xiii. paul & Barnabas toke Marke wt them when they were ſent oute to preache: from whome he alſo departed / as it apereth in the ſayde chapter / & returned to Ieruſalem agayne. And actꝭ. xv paul & Barnabas were at varyaunce aboute him / paul not wyllynge to take him wt them / becauſe he forſoke thē in their fyrſt Iorneye. Notwtſtondynge yet / when paul wrote ye epiſtle to ye colloſſyās / Marke was wt him / as he ſayth in the fourth chapter: of whome Paul alſo teſtifieth / both yt he was Barnabas ſiſters ſonne and alſo his felowe worker in the kyngedome of God.

And .ii. Timothe. iiii paul cōmaundeth Timothe to brynge Marke wt him / affirmynge yt he was nedefull to him / to myniſter to him. Finallye / he was alſo wt peter when he wrote his fyrſt epiſtle / & ſo famylier yt peter calleth him his ſonne. Wherof ye ſe / of whome he learned his goſpell / euen of the verye apoſtles / with whome he had his cōtynuall converſacion / & alſo of what auctoryte his wrytynge is / and how worthie of credence.

                  LUcas was Pauls companyon / at the leaſt waye frō ye .xvi. of the actꝭ forth & with him in all his trybulacyō. And he wēt with paule at his laſt goynge vp to Ieruſalem.

                     s in pryſon. And he was with Paul when he wrote to ye colloſſyōs / as he teſtifieth in ye fourth chapter ſayenge: the beloued Lucas the phiſiciō ſaluteth you. And he was wt paul whē he wrote ye ſecōde piſtle to Timothe / as he ſayth ī ye fourth chapter ſayenge: Onlye Lucas is with me. Wherby ye ſe ye auctorite of the man and of what credēce & reuerēce his wrytinge is worthie of / & therto of whome he learned ye ſtorye of his goſpell / as he him ſelfe ſayth / how yt he learned it & ſearched it oute with all dylygence of them yt ſawe it and were alſo parttakers

                  ¶ Iohn.
                  IOhn / what he was / is manyfeſt by the thre fyrſt euāgeliſtꝭ. Fyrſt chriſtes apoſtle / & yt one of ye chefe. Thē chriſtes nye kinſmā / & for his ſynguler innocēcie & ſoftenes / ſingulerlye beloued & of ſynguler famyliarite with chriſt / & euer one of ye thre wytneſſes of mooſt ſecret thynges. The cauſe of his wrytynge was certayne hereſyes that aroſe in his tyme / & namelye two / of which one denyed chriſt to be verye man & to be come in ye verie fleſhe & nature of man. Agaynſt which two hereſyes he wrote both his goſpell & alſo his fyrſt epiſtle / & in ye begynnynge of his goſpell ſayth yt the worde or thynge was at ye begynnynge / & was wt God / & was alſo verye God and yt all thynges was created & made by yt / and yt it was alſo made fleſhe: yt is to ſaye / became verie mā. And he dwelt amōge vs (ſayth he) & we ſawe his glorye.
                  And in ye begynnynge of his piſtle / he ſaith we ſhew you of ye thynge yt was frō the begynnynge / which alſo we heard / ſawe wt oure eyes & oure handes hādeled. And agayne we ſhew you euerlaſtynge lyfe / that was with ye father and apered to vs / & we heard and ſawe. & ce.

In that he ſayth that it was from the begynnynge / and that it was eternall lyfe / and that it was with God / he affirmeth him to be verie God. And that he ſayth / we hearde / ſawe and fealte / he wytneſſeth that he was verie man alſo. Ihon alſo wrote laſt / and therfore touched not the ſtorie that the other had compiled. But wryteth moſt of the fayth and promyſes / & of the ſermones of Chriſt. This be ſofficient concerninge the .iiii. Euangeliſtes and their auctoritie and worthynes to be beleued.

            Willyam Tindale / yet once more to the chriſten reader.
            
               THou ſhalt vnderſtonde mooſt dere reader / when I had taken in hāde to looke ouer the new teſtament agayne & to cōpare it with ye greke / and to mende whatſoeuer I coulde fynde amyſſe & had almoſt fyneſſhed ye laboure: George Ioye ſecretly toke in hand to correct it alſo by what occaſyon his conſcyence knoweth: & preuēted me / in ſo moche / yt his correccyō was prynted in great nombre / yer myne begāne. When it was ſpyed and worde brought me: though it ſemed to dyuers other yt George Ioye had not vſed ye offyce of an honeſt mā / ſeinge he knew yt I was in correctynge it myſelfe: nether dyd walke after ye rules of yt loue & ſoftenes which chriſt / & his deſciples teache vs / how yt we ſhuld do nothynge of ſtryfe to moue debate / or of vayne glorie or of couetouſnes. Yet I toke ye thīge in worth as I have done dyuers other in tyme paſt / as one that have moare experyēce of ye nature & dyſpoſiciō of yt mānes cōplexion / & ſuppoſed that a lytle ſpyſe of couetouſnes & vayne glorie (two blynde gydes) had bene ye onlye cauſe yt moued him ſo to do / aboute which thynges I ſtryue with no man: & ſo folowed after & corrected forth & cauſed this to be prynted / without ſurmyſe or lokynge on his correctyon.
            
               But when the pryntynge of myne was almoſt fyneſſhed / one brought me a copie & ſhewed me ſo manye places / in ſoche wyſe altered that I was aſtonyed & wondered not a lytle what furye had dryuē him to make ſoche chaunge & to call it a diligent correctiō. For thorow oute Mat. Mark & Luke perpetually: and ofte in the actees / & ſometyme in Iohn & alſo in the hebrues / where he fyndeth this worde Reſurrecciō / he chaungeth it into ye lyfe after this lyfe / or verie lyfe / and ſoche lyke / as one that abhorred the name of the reſurreccion.
            If that chaunge / to turne reſurreccion into lyfe after this lyfe / be a dylygent correccion / then muſt my tranſlaciō be fautie in thoſe places / & ſaynt Ieromes / and all ye tranſlatours that euer I heard of in what tonge ſo euer it be / frō ye apoſtles vnto this his dylygēt correccyō (as he calleth it) which whither it be ſo or no / I permyt it to other mennes iudgemētes.
            But of this I chalenge George Ioye / that he dyd not put his awne name therto and call it rather his awne tranſlacion: & that he playeth boo pepe / & ī ſome of his bookes putteth in his name & tytle / and in ſome kepeth it oute It is lawfull for who will / to tranſlate and ſhew his mynde / though a thouſand had trāſlated before him. But it is not lawfull (thynketh me) ner yet expedyēt for the edifienge of the vnitie of the fayth of chriſt / that whoſoeuer will / ſhall by his awne auctorite / take another mannes tranſlacion & put oute & in and

chaunge at pleaſure / & call it a correccion.
            Moreover / ye ſhall vnderſtōde that George Ioye hath had of a longe tyme marvelouſe ymaginaciōs aboute this worde reſurrecciō / yt it ſhuld be taken for the ſtate of the ſoules after their departinge frō their bodyes / & hath alſo (though he hath been reaſoned with therof & deſyred to ceaſe) yet ſowen his doctryne by ſecret lettres on that ſyde the ſee / & cauſed great diviſion amōge ye brethrē. In ſo moche that Iohn Fryth beynge in preſon in the toure of Londō / a lytle before his death / wrote yt we ſhuld warne him & deſyer him to ceaſe / & wolde have then wrytten agaynſt him / had I not withſtonde him. Therto I have been ſence informed yt no ſmall nōber thorow his curioſite / vtterly denye the reſurreccion of ye fleſſhe & bodye / affirminge yt the ſoule whē ſhe is departed / is the ſpirituall bodye of the reſurreccion / & other reſurreccion ſhall there none be. And I have talked with ſome of them myſelfe / ſo doted in that folye / that it were as good perſwade a poſt / as to plucke that madnes oute of their braynes. And of this all is George Ioyes vnquyet curioſite ye hole occaſion / whether he be of the ſayde facciō alſo / or not / to that let him anſwer him ſelfe.
            If George Ioye wyll ſaye (as I wot well he will) that his chaunge / is the ſence & meaninge of thoſe ſcriptures. I anſwer it is ſoner ſayde then proved: howbeit let other mē iudge. But though it were ye verie meaninge

of the ſcripture: yet if it were lawfull after his enſample to every man to playe boo pepe with the tranſlacions that are before him / & to put oute ye wordes of ye text at his pleaſure & to put in every where his meaninge: or what he thought the meaninge were / that were the next waye to ſtablyſhe all hereſyes and to deſtroye the grounde wherewith we ſhuld improve them. As for an enſample / whē Chriſt ſayth Io. v. The tyme ſhall come in ye which all that are in the graves ſhall heare his voyce & ſhall come forth: they that have done good vnto reſurreccion of lyfe / or with the reſurreccion of lyfe / & they have done evell / vnto ye reccion or with the reſurreccion of damnaciō. George Ioyes correccion is / they that have done good ſhall come forth into the verie lyfe / & they that have done evell into the life of damnaciō / thruſtinge cleane oute this worde reſurrecciō. Now by ye ſame auctorite / & wt as good reaſon ſhall another come & ſaye of the reſt of ye text / they yt are in ye ſepulchres / ſhall heare his voyce / that ye ſence is / the ſoules of thē that are in the ſepulchres ſhall heare his voyce / & ſo put in his diligent correccion & mocke oute ye text / that it ſhall not make for ye reſurrecciō of the fleſſhe / which thinge alſo George Ioyes correcciō doth manyfeſtlye affirme. If the text be lefte vncorrupt / it will pourge hir ſelfe of all maner falſe gloſes / how ſotle ſoever they be fayned / as a ſethinge pot caſteth vp hir ſcome. But yf the falſe gloſe be

made the text / diligentlye overſene & correct / wherewith then ſhall we correcte falſe doctrine & defende Chriſtes flocke from falſe opinions / & frō ye wycked hereſyes of raveninge of wolves? In my mynde therfore a lytle vnfayned love after the rules of Chriſt / is worth moche hie learninge / & ſingle & ſleyght vnderſtondinge that edifieth in vnitie / is moche better then ſotle curioſite / & mekenes better then bolde arrogancye and ſtondinge over moche in a mannes awne conſayte.
            Wherfore / concernynge the reſurreccion / I proteſt before god and oure ſavioure Ieſus Chriſt / and before the vniverſall congregacion that beleveth in him / that I beleve accordynge to the open and manyfeſt ſcriptures & catholyck fayth / that Chriſt is ryſen agayne in ye fleſſhe which he receaved of his mother ye bleſſed virgin marie / & bodye wherin he dyed. And yt we ſhall all both good and bad ryſe both fleſſhe & bodye / & apere together before the iudgement ſeat of chriſt / to receave every man accordynge to his dedes. And that the bodyes of all that beleve & contynew in the true fayth of chriſt / ſhalbe endewed wt lyke immortalyte and glorie as is ye bodye of chriſt
            And I proteſt before God and oure ſavioure Chriſt & all that beleve in him / that I holde of ye ſoules that are departed as moche as maye be proved by manifeſt & opē ſcripture / & thinke the ſoules departed in the fayth of Chriſt & love of the lawe of God / to be in no worſe caſe then ye ſoule of Chriſt was / frō ye tyme 
yt he delivered his ſprite into the handes of his father / vntyll the reſurreccion of his bodye in glorie & immortalite. Neverthelater / I cōfeſſe openly / yt I am not perſuaded yt they be all readie in the full glorie that Chriſt is in / or the elect angels of god are in. Nether is it anye article of my fayth: for if it ſo were / I ſe not but then the preachinge of the reſurrecciō of the fleſſhe were a thinge in vayne. Notwithſtondinge yet I am readie to beleve it / if it maye be proved with open ſcripture. And I have deſyred George Ioye to take opē textes that ſeme to make for yt purpoſe / as this is. To daye thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe / to make therof what he coulde / and to let his dreames aboute this worde reſurreccion goo. For I receave not in ye ſcripture yt pryvat interpretaciō of any mānes brayne / without opē teſtimony of eny ſcriptures agreinge thereto.
            Moreover I take God (which alone ſeeth ye heart) to recorde to my conſcience / beſechinge him yt my parte be not in ye bloude of Chriſt / if I wrote of all yt I have wryttē thorow oute all my boke / ought of an evell purpoſe / of envie or malice to anye mā / or to ſtere vp any falſe doctrine or opinion in the churche of Chriſt / or to be auctor of anye ſecte / or to drawe diſciples after me / or that I wolde be eſtemed or had in pryce above the leaſt chylde yt is borne / ſave onlye of pitie & cōpaſſion I had & yet have on the blindnes of my brethrē / & to bringe them vnto the knowledge of Chriſt / &

to make every one of them / if it were poſſible as perfect as an angell of heavē / & to wede oute all yt is not planted of oure hevenly father / & to bringe doune all that lyfteth vp it ſelfe agaynſt the knowledge of the ſalvacion that is in ye bloude of Chriſt. Alſo / my parte be not in Chriſt / if myne heart be not to folowe & lyve accordinge as I teache / and alſo if myne heart wepe not nyght & daye for myne awne ſynne & other mennes indifferētlye / beſechinge God to cōvert vs all / & to take his wrath from vs / & to be mercifull as well to all other men / as to myne awne ſoule / caringe for the welth of the realme I was borne in / for the kinge and all that are therof / as a tender hearted mother wolde do for hir only ſonne.
            As concerninge all I have tranſlated or other wiſe written / I beſeche all men to reade it for that purpoſe I wrote it: even to bringe them to the knowledge of the ſcripture. And as farre as the ſcripture approveth it / ſo farre to alowe it / & if in anye place the worde of god dyſalow it / there to refuſe it / as I do before oure ſavyour Chriſt & his congregacion. And where they fynde fautes / let them ſhew it me / if they be nye / or wryte to me / if they be farre of: or wryte opēly agaynſt it & improve it / & I promyſe them / if I ſhall perceave that there reaſons conclude I will confeſſe myne ignoraunce openly.
            Wherfore I beſeche George Ioye / ye & all other to / for to tranſlate ye ſcripture for them

ſelves / whether oute of Greke / Latyn: or Hebrue. Or (if they wyll nedes) as ye foxe when he hath pyſſed in ye grayes hole chalengeth it for his awne / ſo let them take my tranſlacions & laboures / & chaunge & alter / & correcte & corrupte at their pleaſures / and call it their awne tranſlaciōs / & put to their awne names / & not to playe boo pepe after George Ioyes maner. Which whether he have done faythfully & truly / with ſuche reverence & feare as becōmeth the worde of God / & with ſoche love and mekenes & affeccion to vnite and circū
               ſpexcion that the vngodlye have none occaſion to rayle on the verite / as becōmeth ye ſervauntes of Chriſt / I referre it to the iudgemē
               tes of them that knowe and love the trouth. For this I proteſt / that I provoke not Ioye ner any other man (but am prouoked / & that after the ſpytfulleſt maner of provokynge) to do ſore agaynſt my will and with ſorow of harte that I now do. But I nether can ner will ſoffre of anye man / that he ſhall goo take my tranſlacion and correct it without name / & make ſoche chaungynge as I my ſelfe durſt not do / as I hope to have my parte in Chriſt / though the hole worlde ſhuld be gevē me for my laboure.
            Finally that new Teſtamēt thus dyligētly corrected / beſyde this ſo ofte puttinge oute this worde reſurreccion / and I wote not what other chaūge / for I have not yet reede it over / hath in the ende before the Table of the

Epiſtles and Goſpelles this tytle: (Here endeth the new Teſtament dylygentlye ouerſene and correct and printed now agayne at Andwarp / by me wydow of Chriſtophell of Endhouen.

               When he had thus ſpoken / he kneled doune / and prayed with them all. And they wept all aboundantly / and fell on Pauls necke / & kiſſed him / ſorowinge moſt of all for the wordes which he ſpake / that they ſhuld ſe his face no moore. And they acompanyed him vnto the ſhyppe.

               ANd it chaunſed that aſſone as we had  launched forth / & were departed from them / we came with a ſtrayght courſe vnto Choon / and the daye folowinge vnto the Rhodes / & from thence vnto Patara. And we founde a ſhippe redy to ſayle vnto Phenices / and went a borde & ſet forthe. Then appered vnto vs Cyprus / and we lefte it on the lefte honde / and ſayled vnto Syria / and came vnto Tyre. For there the ſhyppe vnladed her burthen. And when we had founde brethren / we taryed there .vii. dayes. And they tolde Paul thorowe ye ſprete: that he ſhuld not goo vp to

Ieruſalem. And when the dayes were ended / we departed & went

               When we had full ended the courſe frō Tyre / we aryved at Ptolomaida / & ſaluted the brethren / & abode with thē one daye. The nexte daye / we that were of Pauls cōpany / departed & came vnto Ceſarea. And we entred into the houſſe of Philip y• Evāgeliſt / which wasPhillip. one of the ſevē deacones / & abode with him. The ſame man had fower doughters virgēs / which dyd propheſy. And as we taried there a good many dayes / there came a certayne prophete from Iurie / named Agabus. When heAgabus. was come vnto vs / he toke Pauls gerdell / & bounde his hondes & fete / & ſayde: thus ſaith the holy gooſt: ſo ſhall y• Iewes at Ieruſalem bynde the man yt oweth this gerdell / & ſhall delyver him into the hondes of the gentyls.
               When we hearde this / both we & other of  the ſame place / be ſought him / that he wolde not goo vp to Ieruſalem. Then Paul anſwered & ſayde: what do ye wepynge & breakinge myne hert? I am redy not to be bound only / but alſo to dye at Ieruſalem for ye name of y• Lorde Ieſu. When we coulde not turne his mynde / we ceaſed ſayinge: the will of y• Lorde be fulfilled. After thoſe dayes we made oure

ſelfes redy / & went vp to Ieruſalem. There went with vs alſo certayne of his diſciples of Ceſarea / & brought with them one Mnaſon of Cyprus / an olde diſciple with whom we ſhuld lodge. And when we were come to Ieruſalem / the brethren receaved vs gladly. And on the morowe Paul wēt in with vs vn to Iames. And all the elders came to geder. And when he had ſaluted them / he tolde by  order all thingꝭ that God had wrought amō
                  ge the gētyls by his miniſtracion. And when they hearde it / they glorified the Lorde / & ſayde vnto him: thou ſeiſt brother / how many thouſande Iewes ther are which beleve / and they are all zelous over y• lawe. And they are informed of the / that thou teacheſt all the Iewes which are amōge the gentyls / to forſake Moſes / & ſayſt that they ought not to circumciſe their chyldren / nether to live after the cuſtomes. What is it therfore? The multitude muſt nedes come togeder. For they ſhall heare that thou arte come. Do therfore this that we ſaye to the.
               We have .iiii. men / which have a vowe on

For as touchinge the gentyls which beleve / we have written & concluded / y• they obſerve no ſoche thinges: but that they kepe them ſelves from thinges offred to

ydoles / from bloud / frō ſtrangled & frō fornicacion. Then the nexte daye Paul toke the men / & purified him ſelfe with them / & entred into the tēple / declaringe that he obſerved the dayes of y• purificaciō / vntyll that an offeringe ſhuld be offred for every one of them.
               And as the ſeven dayes ſhuld have bene ended / y• Iewes which were of Aſia when they ſawe him in the tēple / they moved all the people / & layde hondes on him cryinge: men of Iſrael helpe. This is the man that teacheth all men every where agaynſt the people / & the lawe / and this place. Moreover alſo he hath brought Grekes into the tēple / & hath polluted this holy place. For they ſawe one Trophimus an Epheſian with him in the cyte. Him they ſuppoſed Paul had brought into the tēple. And all the cyte was moved / & the people ſwarmed to geder. And they toke Paul & drue him out of the tēple / & forthwith the dores were ſhut to.
               As they went about to kyll him / tydinges came vnto the hye captayne of the ſoudiers / that  all Ieruſalem was moved. Which immediatly toke ſoudiers & vndercaptaynes / & ranne doune vnto them. When they ſawe y• vpper captayne & the ſoudiers / they lefte ſmytinge of Paul. Then the captayne came neare & toke him / & cōmaunded him to be bounde with two chaynes / & demaunded what he was / & what he had done. And one cryed this / another that amōge the people. And whē he coulde not knowe the certayntie for y• rage / 

he cōmaunded him to be caryed into the caſtle. And whē he came vnto a grece / it fortuned that he was borne of the ſoudiers of the violence of the people. For the multitude of the people folowed after cryinge: awaye wt him.
               And as Paul ſhuld have bene caryed into  the caſtle / he ſayde vnto the hye Captayne: maye I ſpeake vnto the? Which ſayde: canſt thou ſpeake Greke? Arte not thou that Egypcian which before theſe dayes made an vp roure & ledde out into the wildernes .iiii. thou ſande men that were mortherers? But Paul ſayde: I am a mā which am a Iewe of Tha

And he ſayde: I am verely aman which am a Iewe / borne in Tharſus / a cite in Cicill: nevertheleſſe yet brought vp in this cite / at y• fete of Gamaliel and informed diligently in the lawe of the fathers / and was fervent mynded to Godwarde / as ye all are this ſame daye / and I perſecuted this waye vnto the deeth byndynge and delyveringe into preſon bothe men and wemen / as the chefe preſt doth beare

And I anſwered: what arte thou Lorde? And he ſayd vnto me: I am Ieſus of Nazareth / whom thou perſecuteſt. And they that were with me / ſawe verely alyght & were a frayde: but they hearde not the voyce of him that ſpake with me. And I ſayde: what ſhall I do Lorde? And the Lorde ſayde vnto me: Aryſe & goo into Damaſco & there it ſhalbe tolde the of all thinges which are apoynted for the to do. And when I ſawe nothynge for the brightnes of that light / I was ledde by the honde of them that were with me / and came into Damaſco.
               And one Ananias a perfect man / & as pertayninge  to the lawe / havinge good reporte of all the Iewes which there dwelt / came vnto me / & ſtode & ſayd vnto me: Brother Saul / loke vp. And that ſame houre I receaved my ſight and ſawe him.

When Paul was called forth / Tartullus beganne to accuſe him ſaying: Seynge y• we live in great quyetnes by the meanes of the / & that many good thinges are done vnto this nacion thorow thy providence:

 that alowe we ever & in all places / moſt myghty Felix with all thankes. Notwithſtondinge / that I be not tedeous vnto the / I praye the / that thou woldeſt heare vs of thy curteſy a feawe wordes.

               Then Paul (after that the rular him ſelfe  had beckened vnto him that he ſhuld ſpeake) anſwered: I ſhall with a moare quvet minde anſwere for my ſelfe / for as moche as I vnderſtonde y• thou haſt bene of many yeares a iudge vnto this people / becauſe that thou mayſt knowe y• there are yet .xii. dayes ſence I went vp to Ieruſalem for to praye / & that they nether founde me in the tēple diſputinge with eny man / other rayſinge vp the people / nether in the Synagoges / nor in the cite.

which are writtē in the lawe & y• Prophetes / & have hope towardes God / that y• ſame reſurreccion from deeth (which they them ſelves loke for alſo) ſhalbe / both of iuſt & vniuſt. And therfore ſtody I to have a cleare conſciē

And he commaunded an vnder captayne to kepe Paul / and that he ſhuld have reſt / and that he ſhuld forbyd none of his aquayntaūce▪ to miniſter vnto him / or to come vnto him.
               And after a certayne dayes / cā Felix & his wyfe Druſilla which was a Iewas / & called  forth Paul / & hearde him of the fayth which is toward Chriſt. And as he preached of righteouſnes / temperaūce & iudgement to come / Felix trembled & anſwered: thou haſt dóne ynough at this tyme / departe / when I have a

                  Feſtus willinge to do the Iewes a pleaſure / anſwered Paul & ſayde: wilt thou goo to  Ieruſalem / and there be iudged of theſe thinges before me? Then ſayd Paul: I ſtonde at Ceſars iudgemēt ſeate / where I ought to be iudged. To ye Iewes have I no harme done / as thou verely well knoweſt. If I have hurte them / or cōmitted eny thinge worthy of deeth I refuſe not to dye. Yf none of theſe thinges are / where of they accuſe me / no man owghtPaule appealed. to delyver me to them. I appeale vnto Ceſar. Then ſpake Feſtus with deliberacion / & anſwered. Thou haſt appealed vnto Ceſar: vnto Ceſar ſhalt thou goo.
               After a certayne dayes / kinge Agrippa andAgrippa Bernice came vnto Ceſarea to ſalute Feſtus. And when they had bene there a good  ceaſon / Feſtus reherſed Paules cauſe vnto y• kynge ſayinge: ther is a certayne man left in preſon of Felix / about whom when I came to Ieruſalem / the hye preſtes & elders of the Iewes enformed me / & deſyred to have iudgement agaynſt him. To whom I anſwered: It is not the maner of the Romayns to delyver eny man / that he ſhuld periſſhe / before that he which is accuſed / have the accuſars before him / and have licence to anſwer for him ſelfe / conſerninge y• cryme layde agaynſt him: whē
                   they were come hidder / wt out delaye on the morowe I ſate to geve iudgement / & cōmaunded y• mā to be brought forthe. Agaynſt whō when y• accuſers ſtode vp / they brought none accuſacion of ſoche thingꝭ as I ſuppoſed: but

had certayne queſtions agaynſt him of their awne ſuperſticion / & of one Ieſus which was ded: whom Paul affirmed to be alyve. And becauſe I douted of ſoche maner queſtions / I ayed him whyther he wolde goo to Ieruſalem / & there be iudged of theſe matters. Then when Paul had appealed to be kept vnto the knowledge of Ceſar / I commaunded him to be kept / tyll I myght ſende him to Ceſar.
               Agrippa ſayd vnto Feſtus: I wolde alſo  heare ye man my ſelfe. To morowe (ſayde he) thou ſhalt heare him. And on ye morowe when Agrippa was come and Bernice with greate pompe / & were entred into the counſell houſſe with the captaynes & chefe men of the cite / at Feſtus commaundement Paul was brought forth. And Feſtus ſayde: kynge Agrippa / & all men which are heare preſent wt vs: ye ſe this man about whom all the multitude of the Iewes have bene with me both at Ieruſalem and alſo here / cryinge that he ought not to lyve eny lenger. Yet founde I nothinge worthy  of deeth that he had cōmitted. Nevertheleſſe ſeinge that he hath appealed to Ceſar / I have determined to ſende him. Of whom I have no certayne thinge to wryte vnto my lorde. Wherfore I have brought him vnto you / and ſpecially vnto the / kynge Agrippa / that after examinacion had / I myght have ſumwhat to wryte. For me thynketh it vnreaſonable / for to ſende a preſoner / and not to ſhewe the cauſes which are layde agaynſt him.
            
            
               ¶ The .xxvi. Chapter.
               
                  AGrippa ſayde vnto Paul: thou arte permitted to ſpeake for thy ſelfe. Then  Paul ſtretched forth the honde / & anſwered for him ſelfe. I thynke my ſelfe happy kynge Agrippa / becauſe I ſhall anſwere this daye before the / of all the thinges wherof I am accuſed of y• Iewes / namely becauſe thou arte experte in all cuſtomes and queſtions / which are amonge the Iewes. Wherfore I beſeche the to heare me paciently.
               My lyvynge of a chylde / which was at the fyrſt amōge myne awne nacion at Ieruſalem  knowe all the Iewes which knew me from ye beginnynge / yf they wolde teſtifie it. For after the moſt ſtrayteſt ſecte of oure laye / lyved I a phariſaye. And now I ſtond & am iudged for the hope of the promes made of God vnto oure fathers: vnto which promes / oure .xii. tribes inſtantly ſervynge God daye & nyght / hope to come. For which hopes ſake / kynge Agrippa / am I accuſed of the Iewes. Why ſhuld it be thought a thinge vncredible vnto  you / that god ſhuld rayſe agayne the deed?
               I alſo verely thought in my ſelfe / that I ought to do many cōtrary thinges / clene agaynſt the name of Ieſus of Nazareth: which thinge I alſo dyd in Ieruſalem. Where many of the ſainctes I ſhut vp in preſon / & had receaved auctorite of y• hye preſtes. And whē they were put to deeth / I give the ſentence. And I punyſſhed them ofte in every ſynagoge / and compelled them to blaſpheme: & was yet more mad apon them / and perſecuted thē / 

even vnto ſtraunge cities. About the which thinges as I went to Damaſco with auctorite and licence of the hye Preſtes / even at myddaye (o kynge) I ſawe in ye waye a lyght from heven / above the brightnes of the ſunne / ſhyne rounde about me and them which iorneyed with me.
               When we were all fallen to the erth / I hearde a voyce ſpeakynge vnto me / & ſayinge in ye 
                   Hebrue tonge: Saul / Saul / why perſecuteſt thou me? It is harde for the to kicke agaynſte the pricke. And I ſayde: Who arte thou lorde? And he ſayde I am Ieſus whom thou perſecuteſt. But ryſe & ſtond vp on thy fete. For I have apered vnto the for this purpoſe / to make the a miniſter & a witnes / both of tho thinges which thou haſt ſene / and of tho thinges in the which I will appere vnto the / delyverynge the from the people / and from y• gentyls vnto which nowe I ſende the / to open their eyes that they myght turne from darcknes vnto lyght / & from the power of Satan vnto God / that they maye receave forgevenesFayth. of ſynnes and inheritaūce amonge thē which are ſanctified byfayth in me.
               Wherfore kynge Agrippa / I was not diſobedient  vnto the hevenly viſion: but ſhewed fyrſt vnto them of Damaſco / and at Ieruſalem / and thorow out all the coſtes of Iewry / and to the gentyls / that they ſhuld repent / & turne to God / and do the ryght workes of repentaunce. For this cauſe the Iewes caught me in the temple / and went about to kyll me.

Nevertheleſſe I obtayned helpe of God / & cō
                  tynew vnto this daye witneſſyng bothe to ſmall and to greate ſaying none other thinges / then thoſe which the prophetes and Moſes dyd ſaye ſhuld come / that Chriſt ſhulde ſuffre / & that he ſhuld be the fyrſt that ſhulde ryſe from deeth / and ſhuld ſhewe lyght vnto the people / and the gentyls.
               As he thus anſwered for him ſelfe: Feſtus ſayde with a lowde voyce: Paul / thou arte beſides thy ſelfe. Moche learnynge hath made the mad. And Paul ſayde: I am not mad moſt dere Feſtus: but ſpeake the wordes of trueth & ſobernes. The kynge knoweth of theſe thinges / before whom I ſpeke frely: nether thynke I that eny of theſe thinges are hydden frō him. For this thinge was not done in a corner. Kynge Agrippa beleveſt thou ye prophetes? I wote well thou beleveſt. Agrippa ſayde vnto Paul: Sumwhat thou bringeſt me in mynde for to be come a Chriſten. And Paul ſayd: I wolde to God that not only thou: but  alſo all that heare me to daye / were / not ſumwhat only / but altogeder ſoche as I am / except theſe bonde. And when he had thus ſpoken / the kynge roſe vp / & the debite / and Bernice / and they that ſate with them. And when they were gone aparte / they talked betwene them ſelves ſayinge: This man doeth nothinge worthy of deeth / nor of bondes. Then ſayde Agrippa vnto Feſtus: This man myght have bene lowſed / yf he had not appealed vnto Ceſar.
            
            
               ¶ The .xxvii. Chapter.
               
                  VVhen it was cōcluded that we ſhuld  
                  ij. cor. xi. ſayle into Italy / they delivered Paul & certayne other preſoners vnto one named Iulius / an vnder captayne of Ceſars ſoudiars. And we entred into a ſhip of Adramicium / & lowfed from lond / apoynted to ſayle by the coſtes of Aſia / one Ariſtarcus out of Macedonia / of the contre of Theſſalia / beinge with vs. And the nexte daye we came to Sidon. And Iulius courteouſly entreated Paul / & gave him liberte to goo vnto his frendes / & to refreſſhe him ſelfe. And from thence lanched we / and ſayled harde by Cypers / becauſe the wyndes were contrarye. Then ſayled we over the ſee of Cilicia / and Pamphylia / and came to Myra a cite in Lycia.
               
               And there y• vnder captayne founde a ſhippe of Alexanderredy to ſayle into Italy & put vs therin. And when we had ſayled ſlowly many dayes / & ſcace were come over agaynſt Gnydon (becauſe the wynde with ſtode vs) we ſayled harde by the coſtes of Candy / over agaynſte Salmo / and with moche worke ſayled beyonde yt / and came vnto a place called good porte. Nye whervnto was a citie called Laſea. When moche tyme was ſpent and ſaylinge was now ieoperdeous / becauſe alſo that we had overlonge faſted / Paul put them in remembraunce / and ſayde vnto them  Syrs / I perceave that this vyage wilbe with hurte and moche domage / not of the ladynge and ſhip only: but alſo of oure lyves. Neverthelather the vndercaptayne beleved the governer

and the maſter / better then tho thinges which were ſpoken of Paul. And becauſe the haven was not cōmodius to wynter in / many toke counſell to departe thence / yf by eny meanes they myght attayne to Phenices and there to wynter / which is an haven of Candy / and ſervith to the ſouthweſt and northweſt wynde. When the ſouth wynde blewe / they ſuppoſynge to obtayne their purpoſe / lowſed vnto Aſſon / and ſayled paſte all Candy.
               But anone after ther aroſe agaynſte their  purpoſe / a flawe of wynde out of the northeeſte. And when the ſhip was caught / & coulde not reſiſt the wynde / we let her goo & drave with the wether. And we came vnto an yle named Clauda / & had moche worke to come by abote / which they toke vp and vſed helpe / vndergerdynge the ſhippe / fearynge leſt we ſhuld have fallen into Syrtes / and we let doune a veſſell & ſo were caryed. The nexte daye when we were toſſed wt an exceadynge tempeſt / they lyghtened y• ſhip / & the thyrde daye we caſt out with oure awne hondes / the tacklynge of the ſhippe. When at the laſt nether ſunne nor ſtarre in many dayes appered / & no ſmall tempeſt laye apon vs / all hope that we ſhuld be ſaved / was then taken awaye.
               Then after longe abſtinence / Paul ſtode  forth in the myddes of them & ſayde: Syrs ye ſhulde have harkened to me / & not have lowſed from Candy / nether to have brought vnto vs this harme and loſſe. And nowe I exhorte you to be of good chere. For ther ſhalbe no

loſſe of eny mās lyfe amonge you / ſave of the ſhip only. For ther ſtode by me this nyght the angell of God / whoſe I am / and whom I ſerve / ſayinge: feare not Paul / for thou muſt be brought before Ceſar. And lo / God hath geven vnto the all that ſayle with y•. Wherfore Syrs be of good chere: for I beleve God / that ſo it ſhalbe even as it was tolde me. How be it we muſt be caſt into a certayne ylonde.
               But when ye fourtēthe nyght was come / as  we were caryed in Adria about mydnyght / the ſhipmen demed that ther appered ſome countre vnto thē: and ſounded / & founde it .xx. feddoms. And when they had gone a lytell further / they ſounded agayne / & founde .xv. feddoms. Then fearinge leſt they ſhuld have fallen on ſome Rocke / they caſt .jiii. ancres out of the ſterne / & wyſſhed for y• daye. As the ſhipmen were about to fle out of the ſhip / and had let doune the bote into the ſee / vnder a coloure as though they wolde have caſt ancres out of the for ſhippe: Paul ſayd vnto y• vnder captayne & the ſoudiers: excepte theſe abyde in the ſhip / ye cannot be ſafe. Then the ſoudiers cut of the rope of the bote / and let it fall awaye.
               And in y• meane tyme betwixt that & daye Paul beſought them all to take meate / ſayinge: this is y• fourtenthe daye that ye have taried and continued faſtynge / receavinge nothinge at all. Wherfore I praye you to take meate: for this no dout is for youre helth: for ther ſhall not an heere fall frō the heed of eny of you. And when he had thus ſpokē / he toke

breed and gave thankes to God in preſence of thē all / and brake it / & begāne to eate. Then were they all of good cheare / & they alſo toke meate. We were all together in y• ſhip / two  hundred thre ſcore & ſixtene ſoules. And whē they had catē ynougth / they lightened y• ſhip and caſt out the wheate into the ſee.
               Whē yt was daye / they knew not y• lande but they ſpied a certayne haven with a banke into ye which they were mynded (yf yt were poſſible) to thruſt in the ſhip. And when they had taken vp the ancres / they cōmytted them ſelves vnto the ſee / & lowſed the rudder bondes & hoyſed vp y• mayne ſayle to the wynde & drue to londe. But they chaunſed on a place / which had the ſee on bothe the ſydes / and thruſt in the ſhip. And the foore parte ſtucke faſt and moved not / but ye hynder brake with the violence of the waves.
               The ſoudears counſell was to kyll y• preſoners / leſt eny of them / when he had ſwome out / ſhulde fle awaye. But the vndercaptayne willinge to ſave Paul / kept thē from their purpoſe / & commaunded that they yt could ſwyme / ſhulde caſt thē ſelves firſt in to y• ſee / and ſcape to londe. And the other he cōmaunded to goo / ſome an bordes / and ſome on broken peces of the ſhip. And ſo it came to paſſe / that they came all ſafe to londe.
            
            
               The .xxxiii. Chapter.
               
               ANd when they were ſcaped / then they knewe that the yle was called Milete. And the people of the countre ſhewed

vs no lytell kyndnes: for they kyndled a fyre and receaved vs every one / becauſe of the preſent rayne / & becauſe of colde. And when Paul had gaddered a boundle of ſtickes / & put them into the fyre / ther came a viper out of the heet and lept on his honde. When the men of the contre ſawe the worme hange on his honde / they ſayde amonge thē ſelves: this man muſt nedes be a mortherer. Whome (though he have eſcaped the ſee) yet vengeaunce ſuffreth not to lyve. But he ſhouke of the vermen into the fyre / and felt no harme. Howbeit they wayted when he ſhuld have ſwolne / or fallen doune deed ſodenly. But after they had loked a greate whyle / and ſawe no harme come to him / they chaunged their myndes / and ſayde that he was a God.
               In the ſame quarters / the chefe man of the  yle whoſe name was Publius / had a lordſhip pe: the ſame receaved vs / and lodged vs thre dayes courteouſly. And it fortuned that the father of Publius laye ſicke of a fiever / and of a bluddy flixe. To whō Paul entred in & prayde / & layde his hondes on him & healed him. When this was done / other alſo which hadLayenge on of handes. diſeaſes in the yle / came and were healed. And they dyd vs gret honoure. And when we departed / they laded vs with thinges neceſſary.
               After thre monethes we departed in a ſhip of Alexandry / which had wyntred in the yle / whoſe badge was Caſtor & Pollux. And whē we came to Cyracuſa / we taryed there .iii. dayes. And from thence we fet a compaſſe & came

to Regium. And after one daye the ſouth wynde blowe / and we came the next daye to Putiolus: where we founde brethren / & were deſyred to tary with them ſeven dayes / and ſo came to Rome. And from thence / when y• brethren  hearde of vs / they came agaynſt vs to Apiphorum / & to y• thre taverns. When Paul ſawe thē / he thanked God / and wexed bolde. And when he came to Rome / y• vnder captayne delyvered ye preſoners to y• chefe captayne of ye hoſt: but Paul was ſuffered to dwell by him ſelfe with one ſoudier that kept him.
               And it fortuned after thre dayes / that Paul  called ye chefe of y• Iewes together. And whē they were come / he ſayde vnto thē: Men & brethren / though I have cōmitted nothinge agaynſt the people or lawes of oure fathers: yet was I delyvered preſoner from Ieruſalem in to the hondes of ye Romayns. Which when they had examined me / wolde have let me goo / becauſe they founde no cauſe of deeth in me. But when y• Iewes cryed cōtrary / I was conſtrayned to appeale vnto Ceſar: not becauſe I had ought to accuſe my people of. For this cauſe have I called for you / evē to ſe you & to ſpeake with you: becauſe that for the hope of Iſrael / I am bounde with this chayne.
               And they ſayde vnto him: We nether receaved letters out of Iewry pertayninge vnto ye / nether came eny of the brethren that ſhewed  or ſpake eny harme of the. But we will heare of the what thou thynkeſt. For we have hearde of this ſecte / that every wheare it is

ſpoken agaynſt. And when they had apoynted him a daye / ther came many vnto him into his lodgynge. To whom he expounded & teſtifyed the kyngdome of God / and preached vnto thē of Ieſu: both out of the lawe of Moſes and alſo out of the prophetes / even from mornynge to nyght. And ſome beleved ye thinges which were ſpoken / & ſome beleved not.
               When they agreed not amonge thē ſelves / they departed / after that Paul had ſpoken one worde. Well ſpake the holy gooſt by Eſay ye
                  eſai. vi. c. mar. xiij. prophet vnto oure fathers / ſayinge: Goo vn to this people & ſaye: with youre eares ſhall ye heare / and ſhall not vnderſtonde: and withmar. iiij. b luc. viij. f ioh. xij. f rom. xj. b youre eyes ſhall ye ſe and ſhall not perceave.
               For the hert of this people is wexed groſſe / and their eares were thycke of hearynge /  & their eyes have they cloſed: leſt they ſhuld ſe with their eyes / and heare with their eares / and vnderſtonde with their hertes / and ſhuld be converted / and I ſhulde heale them. Be it knowen therfore vnto you / that this ſalvacion of God is ſent to the gentyls / and they ſhall heare it. And when he had ſayde that / the Iewes departed / and had grete deſpiciōs amonge them ſelves.
               And Paul dwelt two yeares full in his lodgynge / and receaved all that came to him / preachyng the kyngdome of God / and teachynge thoſe thinges which concerned the lorde Ieſus / with all confidence / vnforboden.

No man verely can rede it to ofte or ſtudie it to well: for the moare it is ſtudyed the eaſier it is / the moare it is chewed the pleſander it is / and the moare groundely it is ſerched the precio ſet thinges are found in it / ſo greate treaſure of ſpirituall thinges lyeth hyd therin.
               I will therfore beſtowe my laboure and diligence / thorowe this lytell preface or prologe / to prepare awaye in ther vnto / ſo farforth as god ſhall geue me grace / that it maye be the better vnderſtonde of euery man / for it hath bene hetherto euyll darkened with gloſes & wonder full dreames of ſophiſters / that noman cowde ſpye oute the entente & meanynge of it / which neuertheleſſe of it ſelfe / is a bryght lyghte / & ſufficient to geue lyght vnto all the ſcripture.

This word Lawe maye not be vnderſtonde here after the cōmune maner / and to vſe Paules terme / after the maner of men or after

mannes wayes / that thou woldeſt ſaye the lawe here in this place were nothinge but lernynge whiche teacheth what ought to be done and what oughte not to be done / as it goeth with mannes lawe where the lawe is fulfilled with outewarde workes only / though the hert be ne ver ſo farre of. But God iudgeth the grounde of the herte / ye and the thoughtes and the ſecret mouynges of the mynde / & therefore his lawe requireth the grounde of the hert & loue from the botome▪ there of / & is not content with the outeward worke only: but rebuketh thoſe workes moſt of all which ſpringe not of loue from the ground & lowe botome of the herte / though they appere outwarde neuer ſo honeſt & good / as Chriſt in the goſpell rebuketh the Phariſes aboue all other that were open ſynners / & calleth them ypocrites / that is to ſaye Simulars / and paynted Sepulchres. Which Phariſes yet lyued no men ſo pure / as perteynynge to the outewarde dedes & workes of the lawe. Ye & Paul in the thyrd chapter of his Piſtel vnto the Philippians confeſſeth of him ſelfe / that as touchynge the lawe he was ſuche a one as no man cowde complayne on / and notwithſtondynge was yet a murderer of the Chriſten / perſecuted them / and tormented them / ſo ſoore / that he compelled thē to blaſpheme Chriſte / & was all to gether mercyleſſe / as many which now fayne outward good workes are.
               For this cauſe the .c.xv. Pſalme calleth all men lyars / becauſe that noman kepeth the lawe from the grounde of the herte / nether can kepe it / though he appeare outward full of good workes.
               For all mē are naturally enclyned vnto euyll and hate the lawe. We fynde in oure ſelues vnluſt and tediouſnes to do good / but luſt and delectacyon to do euyll. Nowe where no fre luſt

is to do good / there the botome of the hert fulfilleth not the lawe / and there no doute is alſo ſynne / & wrath is deſerued before God / though there be neuer ſo grete an outwarde ſhewe and apearaunce of honeſte lyuinge.
               For this cauſe concludeth ſaynte Paul in the ſeconde Chapter / that the Iewes are all ſynners & tranſgreſſors of the lawe / though they make men beleue / thorowe ypocriſy of outwarde workes / howe that they fulfyll the lawe / and ſayth that he only which doeth the lawe / is ryghteous before God / meanynge therby that no man with outwarde workes / fulfilleth the lawe.
               Thou (ſayeth he to the Iewe) teacheſt / a man ſhulde not breake wedlocke / & yet breakeſt wedlocke thy ſelfe. Wherin thou iudgeſt an other man / therin condemneſt thou thy ſelfe / for thou thy ſelfe doeſt euen the very ſame thinges whiche thou iudgeſt. As though he wolde ſaye / thou lyueſt outewardly well in the workes of the lawe / and indgeſt them that lyue not ſo. Thou teacheſt other men: and ſeeſt a moote in an other mans eye / but art not ware of the beame that is in thyn awne eye. For though thou kepe the lawe outewardly with workes for feare of rebuke / ſhame and punyſſhement / other for loue of rewarde / vauntage and▪ vayne glory / yet doeſt thou all with out luſt and loue towarde the lawe / and haddeſt leuer a greate deale other wyſe do / yf thou dydeſt not feare the lawe▪ ye inwardly in thyne herte / thou woldeſt that ther were no lawe / no nor yet God / the auctor and vengear of the lawe / yf it were poſſible: ſo paynefull it is vnto the to have thyne appetytes refrayned / and to be kepte doune.

ſprete / ſaith he / ſhall rebuke the worlde of ſynne / becauſe they beleue not in me. And Iohn viij. he ſayth: I am the light of the worlde. And therfore in the .xij. of Iohn he byddeth them / whyle they haue light / to beleue in the light / that ye maye be the chyldrē of light: for he that walketh in darcknes wotteth not whether he goeth. Now as Chriſt is the light / ſo is the ignoraunce of Chriſt that darcknes wherof he ſpeaketh / in which he that walketh wotteth not whether he goeth: that is / he knoweth not how to worke a good worke in the ſyght of God / or what a good worke is. And therfore in the .ix. he ſayth: as longe as I am in the worlde / I am the light of the worlde: but there cōmeth night when no man can worke. Which nyght is but the ignoraūce of Chriſt in which no mā can ſe to do anyeworke that pleaſeth God.

               Furthermore / to perceaue this thinge more clearlye / thou ſhalt vnderſtonde / that it is impoſſible to ſynne anye ſynne at all except a man breake the fyrſt commaundement before. Now is the fyrſt commaundement deuyed into

two verſes. Thy Lorde God is one God: and thou ſhalt loue thy Lorde God with all thyne heart / with all thy ſoule / with all thy power and with all thy myght. And the whole cauſe why I ſynne agaynſt anye inferioure precept / is that this loue is not in myne heart: for were this lawe wrytten in my harte & were full & perfect in my ſoule / it wolde kepe myne hearet frō conſentynge vnto anye ſynne. And the whoale & onlye cauſe why this loue is not written in oure heartes / is that we beleue not the fyrſte parte / that oure Lorde God is one God. For wyſt I what theſe wordes / one Lorde & one God meaneth: that is to ſaye / if I vnderſtode that he made all / & ruleth all / & that whatſoeuer is done to me / whether it be good or bad / is yet his will / & that he onlye is the Lorde that ruleth & dothe it: & wiſt I therto what this worde myne meaneth▪ that is to ſaye / if myne heart beleued & felte the infinite benefites & kyndenes of God to me warde / & vnderſtode & erneſtlye beleued the many folde couenauntes of mercie wherwith God hath bounde him ſelfe to be myne wholie & altogether / with all his power / loue / mercie & myght / then ſhuld I loue him with all myne heart / ſoule / power & might / & of that loue euer kepe his cōmaundementes. So ſeye now that as fayth is the mother of all goodnes & of all good workes / ſo is vnbelefe the grounde & rote of all euell and all euell workes.
               Finallie / if anye man hath forſaken ſynne & is cōuerted to put his truſt in Chriſt & to kepe the lawe of God / do the fall at a tyme: the cauſe is / that the fleſſhe thorow neegligēce hath choked the ſprite & oppreſſed hir & taken from hir the fode of hir ſtrēgth. which fode is hir meditacion in God & in his wonderfull dedes / & in the manyfolde couenauntes of his mercie.
               Wherfore then before all good workes as

good frutes / there muſt nedes be fayth in the herte whence they ſpring. And before all bad dedes as bad frutes / there muſt nedes be vnbelefe in the hert as in the rote / foūtayne / pith & ſtrēght of all ſynne. Which vnbelefe & ignoraūce is called the heed of the ſerpēt & of the olde dragon / which the womans ſeed Chriſt / muſt treade vnder fote / as it was promyſed vnto Adam.
               Grace & gifte haue this differēce. Grace properlyGrace. Gyfte. is Goddes fauoure / beniuolence or kynd mynd / which of his awne ſelfe / with oute deſeruing of vs / he beareth to vs / wherby he was moued & enclined to geue Chriſte vnto vs / with all his other giftes of grace. Gifte is the holy goſte & his workinge whom he poureth in to the hertes of them / on whom he hath mercy / and whō he fauoreth. Though the giftes of the ſprite encreace in vs dayly / & haue not yet their full perfeccion: ye & though there remayne in vs yet euill luſtes & ſinne which fight agaynſt the ſprite / as he ſayth here in the .vij. Chapter / & in the v. to the Galathiās / & as it was ſpokē before in the thride Chapter of Geneſis of the debate betwene the womans ſeed & the ſeed of the ſerpēt: yet neuertheleſſe goddis fauoure is ſo greate / & ſo ſtrōge ouer vs for chriſtes ſake / that we are coūted for full hole & perfecte before God. For Goddis fauoure toward vs / deuydeth not hyr ſelfe / encreaſinge a lyttell & a lytell / as doo the gyftes / but receaueth vs hole & all to gether in full loue for Chriſtes ſake oure interceſſor & mediator / & becauſe that the gyftes of the ſprite & the batayle betwene the ſprite and euyll luſtes / are begonne in vs all ready.
               Of this nowe vnderſtondeſt thou the .vij. chapter where Paul accuſeth him ſelfe as a ſynner & yet in the .viij. Chapter ſayeth / there is no damnacion to them that are in Chriſte / and that becauſe of the ſprite / & becauſe the gyftes

of the ſprite are begōne in vs. Synners we are becauſe the fleſſhe is not full kylled & mortified. Neuertheleſſe in as moche as we beleue in Chriſt / & haue the erneſt & begynninge of the ſprite / and wold fayne be perfecte / God is ſo louinge & fauourable vnto vs that he will not loke on ſoche ſynne / nether will counte it as ſynne / but will deale with vs accordinge to oure belefe in Chriſte / & accordinge to his promiſes which he hath ſworne to vs / vntyll the ſynne be full ſlayne & mortified by dethe.
               Faith is not mās opinion & dreame / as ſome ymagin & fayne when they heare the ſtorie ofFayth is not the worke of man. the Goſpell: but when they ſe that there folowe no good workes nor mendement of lyuinge / though they heare / & yet can babyll many thinges of faith / then they fall from the righte waye & ſaye / fayth only iuſtifieth not / a man muſt haue good workes alſo / if he will be rightewes & ſafe. The cauſe is when they heare the Goſpell or glad tydinges / they fayne of their awne ſtrength certayne imaginaciōs & thoughtes in their hertes ſayinge: I haue heard the Goſpell / I remēber the ſtorie / lo I beleue. And that they counte righte fayth / which neuertheleſſe as it is but mās imaginaciō & fayninge / euē ſo profiteth it not / nether folowe there any good workes or mendement of lyuinge.

Faith is a liuely thinge / mighty in workinge / valiaunte & ſtronge / euer doinge / euer frutefull / ſo that it is vnpoſſible that

he which is endued therewith / ſhulde not worke all wayes good workes with oute ceaſinge. He axeth not whether good workes are to be done or not / but hath done thē all redy / yet menciō be made of them / & is all waye doynge / for ſoche is his nature nowe: quicke faithe in his herte & lyuely mouinge of the ſprite driue him & ſtere him therūto.

               Fayth is then a liuely & ſted faſte truſte in the fauoure of God / wherewith we cōmitte oure ſelues all to gedyr vnto God / & that truſte is ſo ſurely groūded & ſteketh ſo faſt in oure hertes / that a mā wolde not once doute of it / though he ſhuld dye a thouſand tymes therfore.

                     ifieth not: but vttereth the ſynne onlye & condemneth. his purpoſe agayne & proueth by the ſcripture / that all men without differēce or excepcion are ſynners / and that by the workes of the lawe no man is iuſtified: but that the lawe was geuē to vtter & to declare ſynne only. Then he beginneth & ſheweth the rightwaye vnto righteweſnes / by what meanes men muſt be made righteous and ſafe / and ſayeth. They are all ſynners & without prayſe before God / & muſt without their awne oeſeruinge be made righteous thorowe fayth in Chriſt / which hath deſerued ſoche righteouſnes for vs / & is become vnto vs goddis mercy ſtole for the remiſſion of ſynnes that are paſt / therby prouing that Chriſtes righteouſnes which cōmeth on vs thorowe fayth / helpeth vs only. Which righteouſnes / ſayeh he is now declared thorowe the goſpell & was teſtified of before by the lawe & the Prophetes. Furthermore (ſayth he) the lawe is holpe & for dered thorowe fayth / though that the workes therof with all their 
                     •
                  oſte are brought to nought & proued not to iuſtifie.
               In the .iiij. Chapter (after that nowe by theFourthe Chapter. iij. fyrſt Chapters / the ſynnes are opened and

the waye of fayth vnto righteouſnes layde) he beginneth to anſwere vnto certayne obiecciōs and cauillacyōs. And firſt he putteth forth thoſe blynd reaſons / which commenly they that wylbe iuſtified by their awne workes / are wōt to make whē they heare that faith only with out workes iuſtifieth / ſayinge / ſhall men do no good workes / ye & yf faith only iuſtifieth / what nedeth a man to ſtody for to do good workes? He putteth forth therfore Abraham for an en ſample / ſayinge: what did Abraham with his workes? was all in vayne? came his workes to no profet? And ſo concludeth that Abrahā with oute and before all workes was iuſtified & made righteous. In ſo moche that before the worke of circumciſion he was prayſed of the ſcripture and called righteous by his faith only / Geneſis .xv. So that he did not the worke of circumciſion for to be holpe therby vnto righteouſnes / which yet God commaunded him to doo / and was a good worke of obedience / So in lyke wiſe no doute none other workes helpe any thinge at all vnto a mās iuſtifiynge: but asOutward workes are ſignes and witneſſes of the inwarde fayth. Abrahams circumciſion was an outeward ſigne whereby he declared his righteouſnes whiche he had by faith / and his obedience and redynes vnto the will of god / euen ſo are all other good workes outeward ſignes and outeward frutes of faith and of the ſprite / which iuſtifie not a man / but that a mā is iuſtified all redy before God inwardly in the hert / thorowe fayth & thorowe ye ſprite purchaſed by chriſtes bloud.
               Here with now eſtabliſſheth ſaynt Paul his doctrine of faith afore reherſed in the thrid chapter / andBleſſed is he that hath his ſinnes for geuē him. bringeth alſo teſtimony of Dauid in the .xiij. pſalme / whiche calleth / a man bleſſed not of workes / but in that his ſinne is not rekened & in that fayth is imputed for
                     •
                   righteouſnes / though he abyde not afterwarde withoute good

workes / when he is once iuſtified.
               For we are iuſtified and receaue the ſprite for to doo good workes / nether were it otherwyſe poſſible to do good workes / excepte we had firſt the ſprite.
               For how is it poſſible to do any thynge wel in the ſight of god / while we are yet in captiuite & bondage vnder the deuill / & the deuill poſſeſſeth vs all to geder & holdeth our hertes / ſo that we cānot once cōſent vnto the will of god. No man therfore can preuent the ſprite in doinge good: but the ſprite muſt firſt come and wake him out of his ſlepe & with the thunder of the lawe feare him / and ſhewe him his miſerable eſtate and wretchednes / & make him abhore / and hate him ſilfe and to deſyre helpe / & then cōforte him agayne with the pleaſant rayne of the Goſpell / that is to ſaye / with the ſwete promyſes of God in Chriſt / and ſtere vppe fayth in him to beleue the promiſes. Then whē he beleueth the promyſes / as God was mercy full to promyſe / ſo is he true to fulfill them / & will geue him the ſprite and ſtrength / both to loue the will of god & to worke ther after. So ſe we that God only (which accordinge to the ſcripture worketh all in all thinges) worketh a mans iuſtifiynge / ſaluacion and healthe / ye and powreth fayth and beleue / luſte to loue goddis will / and ſtrength to fulfill the ſame / in to vs / euen as water is powred into a veſſell / & that of his good will and purpoſe / and not of ourede ſeruinges and merites. Goddis mercy in promyſinge and trueth in fulfilling his promyſes ſaueth vs and not we oure ſelues. And therfore is all laude / prayſe and glory / to be geuen vn to God for his mercy and trueth / and not vnto vs for ouremerites & deſeruinges. After that / he ſtretcheth his enſample oute agaynſte all other good workes of the lawe / and concludeth

that the Iewes cānot be Abrahams heyres becauſe of bloud & kynred only / & moche leſſe by the workes of the lawe / but muſt enheret Abrahams fayth / yf they wilbe the right heyres of Abraham for as moche as Abraham before the lawe / bothe of Moſes & alſo of circ

Moreouer the lawe cauſeth wrath / in as mocheas no man can fulfill it with loue and fuſte / & as longe as ſuche grudginge / hate & in dignacion agaynſt the lawe remayneth in the herte / & is not takē awaye by the ſprite that cō
                  meth by fayth / ſo longe (no doute) the workes of the lawe / declare euidētly that the wrathe of God is vpō vs & not fauoure. Wherfore fayth only receyueth the grace promyſed vnto Abraham. And theſe enſamples were not writtē for Abrahās ſake only (ſayth he) but for oures alſo to whom yf we beleue / fayth ſhalbe rekened lykewyſe for righteouſnes / as he ſayth in the ende of the Chapter.
               In the .v. Chapter he cōmendeth the frutesThe .v.

Where the ſprite is / therit is alwayes ſomer & ther are alwayes

good frutes / that is to ſaye: good workes. This is Pauls order / that good workes ſpringe of the ſprite / the ſprite cometh by fayth & fayth cō

Where the worde of God is preached purely & receaued in the herte / thereis fayth & the ſprite of God / & ther are alſo good workes of neceſſite when ſoeuer occaſion is geuē.

And where Goddis ſprite is not / there can be no good workes / euē as where an appell treis not / there can growe no appels / but; there is vnbelefe / the deuels ſprite & euyll workes. Of this goddis ſprite & his frutes / haue oure holy ypocrites not once knowē / nether yet taſted how ſwete they are / though they fayne many good workes of their awne ymaginacion / to be iuſtified with all / in which is not one crome of true fayth or ſpirituall loue / or of inward ioye / peace and quyetnes of conſcience / for as moche as they haue not the worde of God for them / that ſuche workes pleaſe God / but they are euen the roten frutes of a roten tre.
               After that he breaketh forth / & ritneth at large / & ſheweth whence both ſynne & righteouſnes / deeth & lyfe come. And he cōpareth Adā & Chriſt to gether / thus wyſe reaſoninge & diſputinge / that Chriſt muſt neades come as a ſecōd Adā to make vs heyres of his righteweſnes / thorow a neme ſpirituall birth / without ourede ſeruiges: euē as the firſt Adā made vs heyres of

ſynne / thorowe the bodely generacion / withoute oure deſeruinge. Whereby is euydently knowen and proued to the vttermoſte / that no mā can bringe him ſelfe oute of ſynne vnto righteweſnes / nomore then he coulde haue withſtonde that he was borne bodely. And that is proued herewith / for as moche as the very lawe of God / which of righte ſhulde haue holpe / yf any thinge coulde haue holpe / not only came and brought no helpe with hyr / but alſo encreaſed ſynne / becauſe that the euill & poyſoned nature is offended and vtterly diſpleaſed with thelawe / and the more ſhe is forbed by the lawe / the more is ſhe prouoked and ſet a fyre to fulfill and ſatiſfie hyr luſtes. By the lawe then we ſe clerely that we muſte nedes haue Chriſte to iuſtifie vs with his grace / and to helpe nature.
               In the .vj. he ſetteth forth the chefe and principallThe .vj.

And this chapter teacheth vs / that we are not ſo frefrō ſynne thorowe fayth / that we ſhulde henceforth goo vp and doune ydle carleſſe & ſure of oure ſelues / as though thereBaptyme is a wytneſſe betwene god & vs that we haue promiſed to mortifie the luſtes & ſynne that remayneth in the fleſſhe. &c. were nowe no more ſynne in vs. yes there is ſynne remayninge in vs / but it is not rekened / becauſe of fayth and of the ſprite / which fighte agaynſt it. Wherfore we haue ynough to do all oure ſyues longe / to tame oure bodies / and to compell the members to obeye the ſprite and not the appetites / that therby we myghte be lyke vnto Chriſtes deeth and reſurrecciō / & mighte fulfill oure baptyme / which ſignifieth the mortifiynge of ſynnes / & the newe life of grace. For this batayle ceaſeth not in vs vntill the laſte breth / and vntyll that ſynne be vtterly ſlayne by the deeth of the bodye.
               
                  This thinge (I meane to tame the body and ſo forth) we are able to do (ſayth he) ſeynge we are vnder grace & not vnder the lawe / what it is / not to be vnder the lawe / he him ſelfe expo

But not to be vnder the lawe / is to haue a fre herte renewed with the ſprite / ſo that thou haſte luſte inwardly of thyne awne accorde to do that which the lawe cōmaundeth / with oute cōpulcion / ye though there were no lawe. For grace▪ that is to ſaye Goddis fauoure bringeth vs the ſprite / and maketh vs loue the lawe / ſo vs there nowe no moare ſynne / nether is the lawe nowe any moare agaynſt vs / but at one and agreed with vs & we with it.
               But to be vnder the lawe / is to deale withTo be vnder the lawe what it is. the workes of the lawe / and to worke without the ſprite and grace: for ſo longe no doute ſynne 
                     •
                  ayneth in vs thorowe the lawe / that is to ſaye / the lawe declareth that we are vnder ſynne and and that ſynne hath power & dominiō ouer vs / ſeynge we cannot fulfill the lawe / namely with in in the hert / for as moche as no mā of nature fauoureth the lawe / conſenteth there vnto and deſyteth therin. Which thinge is exceadinge greate ſynne / that we cānot conſent to the lawe which lawe is nothīge elſe ſaue the will of god.
               This is the right fredome & liberte frō ſynne and from the lawe where of hewryteth vnto the ende of this Chapter / that it is a fredome to doo good only with luſte / & to lyue well with oute compulciō of the lawe. Wherfore this fredome is a ſpirituall fredome / which deſtroyeth not the lawe / but miniſtreth that which the lawe requyreth / and where with the lawe is fulfilled that is to vnderſtond / luſte & loue / where with the lawe is ſtilled & accuſeth vs no moare / compelleth vs no moare▪ nether hath oughte to

craue of vs any moare. Euen as though thou were in dette to an other mā / & were not able to paye / two maner wayes mighteſt thou be loſed. One waye / if he wold requyre nothinge of the / and breke thyne obligaciō. An other waye / yf ſo me other good man wolde paye for the / & geue the as moche as thou mighteſt ſatiſfie thine obligaciō with all. Of this wyſe hath Chriſte made vs frefrō the lawe: & therfore is this no wil▪ de fleſſhely liberte / that ſhulde doo nought / but that doeth all thinges / & is fre from the crauinge and dette of the lawe.
               In the .vij. he cōfirmeth the ſame with a ſimilitudeThe .vij. Chapter. of the ſtate of matrimony. As whē the huſbonde dyeth the wyfe is at hyr liberte / and the one lowſed & departed frō the other / not that the womā ſhulde not haue power to marie vnto an other mā / but rather now fyrſte of all is ſhe fre and hath power to marie vnto an other man which ſhe coulde not do before / till ſhe was lowſed frō hyr fyrſt huſbond. Euen ſo are oure conſciences bound & in daūger to the lawe vnder olde Adam the fleſh / as longe as he lyueth in vs. For the lawe declareth that oure hertes are boū
                  de & that we cānot diſconſent frō him. But whē he is mortified & kylled by the ſprite / then is the conſcience fre & at liberte: not ſo that the conſciē
                  ce ſhall nowe nought do / but now fyrſt of all eleuyth vnto an other / that is to wote Chriſt / & bringeth forth the frutes of lyfe. So nowe toTo be vnder the lawe. To belowſe from the lawe. be vnder the lawe / is not to be able to fulfill the lawe / but to be detter to it and not able to paye that which the lawe requyreth. And to belowſe from the lawe / is to fulfill it & to paye that which the lawe demaundeth / ſo that it can now henceforth axe the nought.
               Conſequently Paul declareth more largely the nature of ſynne & of the lawe / how that tho rowe the lawe ſynne reuyueth / moueth hyrſelfe

/ & gadereth ſtrēght. For the old mā & c
                     •
                  rrupte nature / the moare he is forboden & kepte vnder of the lawe / is the moare offended & diſpleaſed there with / for as moche as he cannot paye that which is requyred of the lawe. For ſynne is his nature & of him ſelfe / he cānot but ſynne. Therfore is the lawe deeth to him / tormente & marterdome. Not that the lawe is euyll / but becauſe that the euyll nature cannot ſoffre that which is good / cānot abide that the lawe ſhulde requyre of him any good thinge. Lyke as a ſicke man cannot ſuffre that a man ſhulde deſyre of him to runne / to lepe and to doo other dedes of an wholeman.
               For which cauſe ſaynt Paul concludeth that where the lawe is vnderſtonde & perceaued of the beſte wyſe / there it doeth no moare but vtter ſynne / & bringe vs vnto the knowledge of oure ſelues / & therby kylle vs & make vs bonde vnto eternall damnacion

                  detters of the euerlaſtinge wrath of God / euē as he well fealeth & vnderſtondeth whos conſciēce is truely touched of the lawe. In ſuche daūger were we yer the lawe came / that we knewe not what ſynne mēte / nether yet knowe we the wrath of God apō ſynners / tyll the lawe had vttered it. So ſeeſt thou that a man muſt haue ſome other thinge / ye & a gretter & a moare myghty thinge then the lawe / to make him righteous & ſafe. They that vnderſtō

                  ce / how that the lawe is ſpirituall & requyreth the hert.

I maye of myne awne ſtrength refrayne that I boo myne enimye no hurte / but to loue him with all myne herte / & to put awaye wrathe clene oute of my mynde can I not of myne awne ſtrēgth. I maye refuſe money of myne awne ſtrength / but to put awaye loue vnto riches oute of myne herte can I not do of myne awne ſtrength. To abſtayne from adultery as concerninge the vttewarde dede can I do of myne awne ſtrēgth / but not to deſyre in myne hert is as vnpoſſible vnto me as is to choſe whether I will hōgyr or thruſt / and yet ſo the lawe requireth. Wherfore of a mans awne ſtrength is the lawe neuer fulfilled / we muſt haue thereunto goddis fauoure and his ſprite / purchaſed by Chriſtes bloude.
               Neuertheleſſe when I ſaye a man maye do many thinges vttewardly clene agaynſt his herte / we muſt vnderſtonde that man is but dreuen of diuers appetites / and the greateſt appetite ouercōmeth the leſſe & caryeth the man awaye violently with hyr.
               As when I deſyre vengeaunce / & feare alſo the inconuenience that is lyke to folowe yf feare be greatter / I abſtayner yf the appetite that deſyreth vengeaūce be gretter / I cānot but proſecute the dede / as we ſe by experience in many murtherars and theues / which though they be brought in to neuer ſo great perell of deeth / yet after they haue eſcaped / do euen / the ſame agayne. And cōmen wemen proſecute their luſtes becauſe feare & ſhame are awaye / whē other which haue the ſame appetites in their hertes / abſtayne at the leeſt waye vtwardly or worke ſecretly beynge ouercome of feare & of ſhame & ſo lykewyſe is it of all other appetites.
               Further moare he declareth / how the ſprite &Fleſſhe & ſpirite fight to ge gether. the fleſſhe fighte to gether in one man / and maketh an enſample of him ſelfe / that we myghte lerne to knowe that worke a righte / I meane to

kyll ſynne in oure ſelues. He calleth both the ſprite and alſo the fleſſhe a lawe / becauſe that lyke as the nature of Goddis lawe is to dryue / to compell / and to craue euen ſo the fleſſhe dryueth / compelleth / craueth and rageth / agaynſt the ſprite / and will haue her luſtes ſatiſfied. On the other ſyde dryueth the ſprite / cryeth and fighteth agaynſt the fleſſhe / and will haue his luſte ſatiſfied. And this ſtrife dureth in vs / as longe as we liue: in ſome moare and in ſome ſelfe as the ſprite or the fleſſhe is ſtronger and the very man his awne ſelfe is both the ſprite and the fleſſhe / which fighteth with his awne ſelfe vntyll ſynne be vtterly ſlayne and he all together ſpirituall.
               In the .viij. Chapter he cōforteth ſuche fightersThe. viij Chapter. that they diſpere not becauſe of ſuche fleſſhe / other thinke that they ar leſſe in fauoure with God. And he ſheweth how that the ſynne remayninge in vs / hurteth not / for there is no daūger to them that are in Chriſt which walke not after the fleſſhe / but fight agaynſt it. And he expoūdeth more largely what the nature of the fleſſhe & of the ſprite is / and how the ſprite commeth by Chriſt / which ſprite maketh vs ſpirituall / tameth / ſubdueth and mortifieth the fleſſhe / and certifieth vs that we are neuertheleſſe the ſonnes of God & alſo beloued though that ſynne rage neuer ſo moche in vs / ſo longe as we folowe the ſprite and fighte agaynſt ſynne to kyll & mortife it. And becauſe the chaſtyſinge of the croſſe and ſufferinge are nothinge pleſant / he comforteth vs in oure paſſions and affliccions by the aſſiſtens of the ſprite which maketh interceſſion to God for vs / mightely with groninges that paſſe mans vtteraūce / ſo that mans ſpeche cānot comprehende them / and the creatures morne alſo with vs of greate deſyre that they haue / that we were lowſed from

ſynne & corrupciō of the fleſſhe. So ſe we that theſe thre Chapters / the .vj. vij. viij. doo none other thinge ſo moche as to dryue vs vnto the right worke of fayth / which is to kyll the olde man and mortifie the fleſſhe.
               In the .ix. x. & .xj. Chapters he treateth ofThe .ix. x. and. xj chapters. Goddis predeſtinacion / whence it ſpringeth all together / whether we ſhall beleue or not beleue / be lowſed from ſynne or not be lowſed. By which predeſtinaciō oure iuſtifiynge and ſaluacion are clene takē oute of oure hādes / and put in the hādes of God only / which thinge is moſt neceſſary of all. For we are ſo weke & ſo vncertayne / that yf it ſtode in vs / there wolde of a trueth no mā be ſaued / the deuell no doute wolde deceaue vs. But now is God ſure that his predeſtinaciō cānot deceaue him / nether can eny man withſtand or ſet him and therfore haue we hope and truſt agaynſte ſynne.
               But here muſte a marke be ſet vnto thoſe vn quyet / buſye & hye clyming ſprites howe ferre they ſhall goo / which fyrſt of all bringe hether there hye reaſons & pregnāt wittes / & begynne fyrſt frō an hye to ſerche the botomleſſe ſecretes of Goddis predeſtinaciō / whether they be predeſtinat or not. Theſe muſt nedes ether caſt thē ſelues doune hedelong in to deſperaciō or elſe cō
                  mit them ſelues to fre chaūce careleſſe. But folowe thou the order of this piſtle / & nooſell thyThis do yf thou wilt vnderſtonde ſelfe with Chriſt / & lerne to vnderſtonde what the lawe and the goſpell meane / and the office of both two / that thou marſt in the one knowe thy ſelfe / & how that thou haſt of thy ſelfe no ſtrēgth / but to ſynne: & in the other the grace of Chriſt. And then ſe thou fyghte agaynſt ſynne & the fleſſhe as the .vii. fyrſt chapters teache ye. After that whē thou arte come to the .viii. chapter / and arte vnder the croſſe and ſufferinge of

tribulacion / the neceſſite of predeſtinacion will waxe ſwete & thou ſhalt well fele how precyouſe a thinge it is. For excepte thou haue borne y• croſſe of aduerſite and temptaciō / and haſt felte thy ſelfe brought vnto the very brymme of deſperacion / ye and vnto hell go tes / thou canſt neuer medle with the ſentence of predeſtinacion without thyne awne harme / and without ſecret wrath and grudginge inwardly agaynſt God / for otherwyſe it ſhall not be poſſible for the to thinke that God is righteous & iuſte. Therfore muſt Adam▪ be well mortified and the fleſſhely wytte brought vtterly to nought / yer that thou mayſt awaye with this thinge / & drinke ſo ſtronge wyne. Take hede therfore vnto thy ſelfe / that thou drinke not wyne / while thou art yet but aſucklinge. For euery lerninge hath hyr tyme / meaſure and age / and in Chriſt is there acertayne childhod / in which a mā muſt be content with mylke for a ceaſon / vntyll he waxe ſtronge and growe vp vnto a perfecte man in Chriſt / and be able to eate of moare ſtrō
                  ge meate.
               In the .xij. Chapter he geueth exhortaciōs.The .xij. Chapter For this maner obſerueth Paul in all his piſtles / fyrſt he teacheth Chriſt and the fayth / then exhorteth he to good workes / and vnto continuall mortifyinge of the fleſſhe. So here teacheth he good workes in deade / and the true ſeruinge of God / and maketh all men Preſtes / to offer vp not money and beaſtes / as the maner was in the tyme of the lawe / but their awne bodyes / with killinge and mortifyinge of the luſtes of the fleſſhe.

               And by iuſtifyinge / vnderſtonde none other thinge then to be reconciled to God and to be reſtored vnto his fauoure / & to haue thy ſynnes forgeuē the. As when I ſaye God iuſtifieth vs / vnderſtōde therby / that God for Chriſtes ſake / merites and deſeruinges only receaueth vs vnto his mercie / fauoure and grace / and forgeueth vs oure ſynnes. And when I ſaye Chriſt iuſtifieth vs / vnderſtonde therby that Chriſt onlye hath redemed vs / bought and delyuered vs oute of the wrath of God and damnacion / & hath with his workes onlye / purchaſed vs the mercie the fauoure and grace of God / and the forgeuenes of oure ſynnes. And when I ſaye that fayth onlye iuſtifieth / vnderſtonde therby that fayth and truſt in the truthe of God and in the mercye promyſed vs for Chriſtes ſake / and for his deſeruinge and workes onlye / doth quyet the conſcience and certifie hir that oure ſynnes

be forgeuen and we in the full fauoure of God.
               Furthermore / ſet before thyne eyes Chriſtes workes and thyne awne workes. Chriſtes workes onlye iuſtifiethe and make ſatiſfaccion for thy ſynne / and thyne awne workes not: that is to ſaye / queyeteth thy conſciēce and make the ſure that thy ſynnes are forgeuen the / and not thyne awne workes. For the promyſe of mercie is made the for Chriſtes workes ſake / and not for thyne awne workes ſake. Wherfore ſeinge God hath not promyſed that thyne awne workes ſhall ſaue the / therfore fayth in thine awne workes can neuer quyet thy conſcience ner certifie the before God (When god commeth to iudge and to take a recōnynge) that thy ſynnes are for geuen the. Beyonde all this / myne awne workes can neuer ſatiſfie the lawe or paye hir that I owe hir. For I owe the lawe to loue hir with all myne heart / ſowle / power & myght.

               Finallie that we ſaye fayth onlye iuſtifyeth / ought to offende no man. For if this be true / that Chriſt onlye redemed vs / Chriſt onlye bare oure ſynnes / made ſatiſfaccion for them & purchaſed vs the fauoure of God / then muſt it nedes be true / that the truſt onlye in Chriſtes deſeruinge and in the promiſes of God the father made vs for Chriſtes ſake / doth onlye quyet the conſcience and certifie hir that the ſynnes are forgeuen. And when they ſaye / a man muſt repent / for ſake ſynne / and haue a purpoſe to ſynne no more as nyeas he can and loue the lawe of God: Ergo fayth alone iuſtifieth not. I anſwere / that & all lyke argumentes are nought / and lyke to this. I muſt repent and be

Goſpell muſt be preached me / and I muſt beleue it or elſe I cannot be partaker of the mercie which Chriſt hath deſerued for me / Ergo Chriſt onlye iuſtifieth me not▪ or Chriſt onlye hath not made ſatiſfaccion for my ſynnes. As this is a naughtie argument ſo is the other.
               Now go to reader / and accordinge to the order of Pauls wrytinge / euen ſo do thou. Fyrſt beholde thy ſelfe dyligentlye in the lawe of God / and ſe there thy iuſt damnacion.

But he that propheſieth / ſpeaketh vnto men / to edifyinge / to exhortacion and to comforte. He that ſpeaketh with tonges / proffiteth him ſilfe: he that propheſyeth edifieth the congregacion. I wolde that ye all ſpake with tonges: but rather that ye propheſied. For greater is he that prophiſieth? then he yt
                     
ſpeaketh with tonges / except he expounde itWordes y• are not vnderſtonde proffyt not. alſo / that the congregacion maye have edifyinge. Now brehren if I come vnto you ſpeak

                  Moreover whē thingꝭ with out lyfe / geve ſounde: whether it be a pype or an harpe: except they make a diſtinccion in the ſoundes: how ſhall it beknowen what is pyped or harped? And alſo if the trōpe geve an vncertayne voyce / who ſhall prepare him ſilfe to fyght? Evē ſo lykwyſe whē ye ſpeake with tōge / excepte ye ſpeake wordes that have ſignification / how ſhall yt be vnderſtonde what is ſpokē? For ye ſhall but ſpeake in the ayer.
                  Many kyndes of voyces are in the worlde  and none of them are with out ſignification. If I knowe not what the voyce meaneth / I ſhalbe vnto him that ſpeaketh / an alient: and and he that ſpeaketh ſhalbe an alient vnto me Evē ſo ye (for as moche as ye covet ſpretuall giftes) ſeke that ye maye have plentye vnto y• edifyinge of the congregacion.
                  Wherfore let him that ſpeaketh with tonges / praye that he maye interpret alſo. If I praye with tonge / my ſprete prayeth: but my mynde is with out frute. What is it then? I will praye with the ſprete / ād will praye wt the mynde alſo. I will ſinge with the ſprete / and will ſinge with the mynde alſo.
                  For els when thou bleſſeſt with ye 
                     to ſpeake with tonges or with the ſpirite / is to ſpeake that other vnderſtonde not / as preſtes ſaye their ſeruyce. To ſpeake with y• mynde is to ſpeake that other vnderſtonde / as when the preacher preache

I thanke my god / I ſpeake with tōges moare then ye all. Yet had I lever in ye cōgregaciō / to ſpeake five wordes with my mynde to y• informaciō of other / rather then ten thouſande wordes wt the tonge.
                  Brethrē be not chyldrē in all dedes muſt be ſaw ſed with the doctryne of God / and not with good meanynge onlye witte. How be it as cōcerninge maliciouſnes be chyldrē: but in witte be perfet. In the lawe it is written / with other tōges / & with other lyppes wyll I ſpeake vnto this people / & yet for all that will they not heare me / ſayth the Lorde. Wherfore / tonge are for a ſigne / not to them that beleve: but to them that beleve not. Contrary wyſe / propheſyinge ſerveth not for them that beleve not: but for them which beleve.
                  Yf therfore when all the cōgregacion is come to gedder / & all ſpeake with tonges / ther come in they y• are vnlearned / or they which beleve not: will they not ſaye that ye are out of youre wittes? But & yf all propheſy / & ther  come in one that beleveth not / or one vnlearned / he is rebuked of all men / & is iudged of every man: & ſo are y• ſecretes of his hert opē
                     ned & ſo falleth he doune on his face / & worſhippeth God / & ſayth yt God is wt you in dede.
                  How is it then brethrē? When ye come to▪ gedder / every mā hath his ſonge / hath his doctryne / hath his tōge / hath his revelaciō / hath his interpretaciō. Let all thingꝭ be done vnto edifyinge. If eny man ſpeake wt tonges / let

it be two atonce or at the moſt thre atonce & that by courſe: & let another interprete it. But yf ther be no interpreter / let him kepe ſilence in the cōgregacion / and let him ſpeake to him ſelfe and to God.
                  Let the Prophete ſpeake two atonce / or thre  at once / & let other iudge. Yf eny revelaciō be made to another that ſitteth by / let the fyrſt holde his peace. For ye maye all propheſy one by one / that all maye learne / & all maye have comforte. For y• ſpretes of the Prophete are in the power of the Prophetes. For God is not cauſer of ſtryfe: but of peace / as he is in all other congregacions of the ſaynctes.
                  Let youre wyves kepe ſilence in the cōgregacions. For it is not permitted vnto them toj. timo. ij. gene. iij. c ſpeake: but let them be vnder obedience / as ſayth the lawe. If they will learne eny thinge / let thē aye their huſbandes at home. ForThe woman muſt be in ſubieccion to hir. huſband. it is a ſhame for wemen to ſpeake in the cōgregaciō. Sprōge ye worde of god frō you? Ether came it vnto you only? Yf eny mā thinke him ſylfe a prophet ether ſpirituall: let him vnder ſtonde / what thinges I write vnto you. For they are the cōmaundementes of the Lorde. But & yf eny man be ignorāt / let him beignorant. Wherfore brethren covet to propheſye / & forbyd not to ſpeake with tonges. And let all thinges be done honeſtly & in order.

                  BRethren as pertayninge to the goſpell  which I preached vnto you / which ye have alſo accepted / and in the which ye

continue / by which alſo ye are ſaved: I do you to wit / after what maner I preached vnto you yf ye kepe it / except ye have beleved in vayne.
                  For fyrſt of all I delivered vnto you thatThe fyrſt prynciple of oure fayth. which I receaved: how that Chriſt dyed for oure ſynnes / agreinge to the ſcriptures: and that he was buried / and that he aroſe agayne  the thyrd daye accordinge to the ſcriptures: and that he he was ſene of Cephas / then of the twelve. After that he was ſene of mooeſa. liij. b.

After that appered he to Iames / then to all the Apoſtles.
                  And laſt of all he was ſene of me / as of one that was borne out of due tyme. For I am the leſt of all the Apoſtles / which am not worthy to be called an Apoſtle / becauſe I perſecuted the congregacion of God. But by the grace of God I am that I am. And his grace which is in me / was not in vayne: ✚ but I labored moare aboundauntly then they all / not  I / but the grace of God which is with me. Whether it were I or they / ſo we preache / & ſo have ye beleved.

If ther be no ryſynge agayne from deeth: then is Chriſt not ryſen. If Chriſt be not ryſen / then is oure preachinge vayne / and youre faith is alſo in vayne. Ye and we are founde falce witneſſes of God. For we have teſtifyed of

God / how that he rayſyd vp Chriſt / whom he rayſyd not vp / yf it be ſo that the deed ryſe not vp agayne. For yf the deed ryſe not agayne / then is Chriſt not ryſen agayne. If it beſo ye Chriſt roſe not / then is youre fayth in vayne and yet are ye in youre ſynnes. And therto they which are fallen a ſlepein Chriſt / are periſſhed. If in this lyfe only we beleve on chriſt / then are we of all men the miſerableſt.
                  But now is Chriſt ryſen from deeth / & isFyrſt frutes. be come the fyrſt frutes of them that ſlept. For by a man came deeth / & by a man came reſurreccionapoca. j. b frō deeth. For as by Adam alldye: evē ſo by Chriſt / ſhall all be made alive / and

For he muſt raygne tyll he have putpſal. c. ix. a. hebre. j. d. and .x. c. pſal. viijc hebre. ij. d all his enemyes vnder his fete.
                  The laſt enemye that ſhalbe deſtroyed is deeth. For he hath put all thinges vnder his fete. But when he ſayth / all thinges are put vnder him / it is many feſt that he is excepted / which dyd put all thinges vnder him. When all thinges are ſubdued vnto him: then ſhall the ſonne alſo him ſelfe be ſubiecte vnto him that put all thinges vnder him / y• God maye be all in all thinges.
                  Ether els what do they which are baptiſed over ye deed / yf the deed ryſe not at all? Why are they then baptiſed over the deed? Ye and

why ſtonde we in ieoperdy every houre? By oure reioyſinge which I have in Chriſt Ieſu oure Lorde / I dye dayly.

Be not deceaved: malicious ſpeakinges corupte good māners. Awake truely cut of ſlepe / and ſynne not. For ſome have not the knowlege of God. I ſpeake this vnto youre rebuke.
                  But ſome mā will ſaye: how aryſe ye deed? with what bodyes come they in? Thou fole / that which thou ſoweſt / is not quickened except it dye. And what ſoweſt thow? Thow ſoweſt not that body that ſhalbe: but bare corne (I meane ether of wheet / or of ſome other) and God geveth it a body at his pleaſure / to every ſeed a ſeverall body.

                  Wherfore the lawe was oure ſcolemaſter vnto the tyme of Chriſt / yt we might be made rightewes by fayth. But after yt fayth is come / now are we no lenger vnder a ſcolemaſter.

               Vnto which I anſwer: yf we ſhuld denie this piſtle for thoſe textes ſakes / ſo ſhuld we denye fyrſt Mathew which in his .xij. chap. affirmeth

that he which blaſphemeth the holy gooſt / ſhall nether be forgeuē here ner in y• worlde to come. And then Marke which in his .iij. chap. ſayeth that he that blaſphemeth the holy gooſt / ſhall neuer haue forgeuenes / but ſhal be in daūger of eternall dānaciō. And thyrdly Luke which ſayth there ſhal be no remiſſiō to hī that blaſphemeth the ſpirite of God. Moreouer Iohn in his .j. piſtle ſayth there is a ſynne vnto deeth / for which a mā ſhuld not praye. And .ij. Petr. ij. ſayth: yf a mā be fled frō the vnclennes of the worlde thorow the knowlege of the ſau your Ieſus Chriſt / and then be wropt in agayne / his ende is worſe then the begininge & that it had bene better for him neuer to haue knowē the truthe. And Paul ij. timo. iij. curſſeth Alexāder the coperſinith / deſyringe the Lorde to rewarde him accordinge to his dedes. Which is a ſigne that ether the piſtle ſhuld not be good / or that Alexāder had ſynned paſt forgeuenes / no more to be prayed for. Wherfore ſeinge no ſcripture is of priuat inter pretaciō: but muſt be expounded accordinge to the generall articles of oure fayth & agreable to other opē & euidēt textes / & cōfirmed or cōpared to lyke ſentēces / why ſhuld we not vnderſtō
                  ee theſe places with lyke reuerēce as we do the other / namely when all the remnāt of the piſtle is ſo godlye and of ſo great learninge.
               The fyrſt place in the .vj. Chapter will no more then that they which knowe the truthe / & yet willinglye refuſe the light / and choſe rather to dwell in darcknes / & refuſe Chriſt & make a mocke of him (as the Phariſes which when they were ouercome with ſcripture & myracles that Chriſt was the verye Meſſias / yet had ſoche luſt in iniquite that they for ſoke him / perſecuted him ſlewe him & did all the ſhame that coulde be ymagined to him) cānot be renued (eis Me tano iam) ſayth the Greke / to be conuerted:

               And what is meant by that place in the tēth chapter where he ſayth / yf we ſynne willinglie after we haue receaued the knowledge of the truthe / there remayneth no more ſacrifice for ſynne / is declared ymediatlye after. For he maketh a comparyſon betwene Moſes & Chriſt / ſayenge: if he which deſpiſed Moſes lawe dyed without mercie how moche worſe puniſhement is he worthye of / that treadeth the ſonne of God vnder fote & counteth the bloude of the couenaūt / by which bloude he was ſanctified / as an vnholy thinge & blaſphemeth the ſpirite of grace. By which wordes it is manyfeſt that he meaneth none other by the fore wordes / then the ſynne of blaſphemye of the ſpirite.
               For them that ſynne of ignoraunce or infirmitie / there is reamedie / but for him that knoweth the trouthe / & yet willinglye yeldeth himſelfe to ſynne / and conſenteth vnto the lyfe of ſynne with ſoule and bodye / and had leuer lye in ſynne then haue his poyſoned nature healed by the helpe of the ſpirite of grace / & malyciouſlye perſecuteth the truthe: for him I ſaye there is no remeadye the waye to mercie is locked vp & the ſpirite is taken frō him for his vnthankfulnes ſake no more to be geuen him. Trouthe it is yf a man can tourne to God and beleue in Chriſt / he muſt be forgeuē how depe ſoeuer he hath ſynned: but that wyll not be with oute the ſpirite / & ſoche blaſphemers ſhall no more haue the ſpirite offered them. Let euery mā therfore feare God & beware that he yelde not him ſelfe to ſerue ſynne / but how ofte ſoeuer he ſynne let

begynnynge of his tyme / nether yet ende of his lyfe: but is lykened vnto the ſonne of god and continueth a preſte for ever.
                  Conſyder what a man this was / vnto whō the patriarke Abraham gave tythes of the ſpoyles. And verely thoſe children of levy / which receave the office of the preſtes / have a commaundement to take a cordyng
                        •
                      to the lawe / tythes of the people / that is to ſaye / of their brethren / yee though they ſpronge out of  the loynes of Abraham. But he whoſe kynred is not counted amonge them / receaved tythes of Abraham / and bleſſed him that had the promyſes. And no man denyeth but that which is leſſe / receaveth bleſſinge of yt which is greater. And here men that dye receave tythes. But there he receaveth tythes of whom it is witneſſed / that he liveth. And to ſaye the trueth / Levy him ſilfe alſo which receaveth tythes / payed tythes in Abraham. For he was yet in the loynes of his father Abraham when Melchiſech met him.
                  Yf now therfore perfeccion came by the preſthod of the levites (for vnder that preſthod the people recaved the lawe) what neded  it further more that an other preſt ſhuld ryſe / after the order of Melchiſedech / and not after the order of Aaron? Now no dout / yf the preſthod be tranſlated / then of neceſſitie muſt the lawe be tranſlated alſo.
                  For he of whom theſe thynges are ſpoken / pertayneth vnto another trybe / of which never man ſerved at the aultre. For it is evidēt

that oure lorde ſprouge of the trybe of Iuda / of which trybe ſpake Moſes nothynge concernynge preſthod.
                  And it is yet a more evydent thinge / yf after the ſimilitude of Melchiſedech / ther aryſe a nother preſt / which is not made after the lawe of the carnall commaundmēt: but after the power of the endleſſe lyfe (For he teſtifieth:pſal. cix. Thou arte a preſt forever / after the order of Melchyſedech) Then the commaundmēt that went a fore / is diſanulled / becauſe of hir weaknes and vnproffitablenes. For the lawe made nothynge parfecte: but was an introduccion of a better hope / by which hope / we drawe nye vnto god.
                  And for this cauſe it is a better hope / that it was not promyſed with out an othe. Thoſe preſtes were made wt out an oth: but this 
                     pſal. cix. preſt with an oth / by him that ſaide vnto him The lorde ſware / and will not repent: Thou arte a preſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedech. And for that cauſe was Ieſus a ſtablyſſher of a better teſtament.
                  And amonge them many were made preſtes / becauſe they were not ſuffred to endure by the reaſon of deeth. But this man / becauſe he endureth ever / hath an everlaſtinge preſthod. Wherfore he is able alſo ever to ſave them that come vnto god by him / ſeynge he ever lyveth / to make interceſſion for vs.
                  Soche an hye preſt it became vs to have / which is wholy / harmleſſe / vndefyled / ſeparat from ſynners / & made hyar then heven.

Which nedeth not dayly (as yonder hie preſtes) to offer vp ſacrifice / fyrſt for his awneChriſt once ſacrificed / purged all ſinnes. ſynnes / and then for the peoples ſynnes. For that did he at once for all when he offered vp him ſilfe. For the lawe maketh men preſtes / which have infirmitie: but the worde of the othe that came ſence y• lawe / maketh the ſonne preſt / which is parfecte for ever more.

For every hye preſt is ordeyned to offer gyfres and ſacryfiſes / wherfore it is of neceſſitie / that this man have ſome what alſo to offer. For he were not a preſte / yf he were on y• erth where  are preſtes that acordynge to y• lawe / offer giftes / which preſtes ſerve vnto ye enſample & ſhadowe of hevenly thynges: even as the anſwer of God was geven vnto Moſes when he was about to fynniſhe the tabernacle: Takeexo. xxv act. vij. f. hede (ſayde he) that thou make all thynges accordynge to the patrone ſhewed to the in the mount.

                  THat fyrſt tabernacle verely had ordinaunces / and ſervynges of god / & wordly  holynes. ✚ For there was a fore tabernacle made / wherin was the candleſticke / and the table / and the ſhewe breed / which is called wholy. But with in the ſecōde vayle was ther a tabernacle / which is called holieſt of all / which had the golden ſenſer / and the arcke of

Over the arcke were the cherubis of glory ſhadowynge the ſeate of grace. Of which thynges / we wyll not now ſpeake perticularly.
                  
                  When theſe thynges were thus ordeyned / the preſtes went all wayes into the fyrſt tabernacle & executed the ſervice of god. But into the ſeconde went the hye preſt alone / once every yeare: and not with out bloud / which he offered for him ſilfe / and for the ignoraunce of ye people. Wherwith ye holy gooſt this ſignifyeng / yt the waye of holy thynge / was not yet opēned / whill as yet ye fyrſt tabernacle was ſtondynge. Which was a ſimilitude for  the tyme then preſent / and in which were offered gyftes and ſacrifiſes that coulde not make them that miniſter parfecte / as pertaynynge to the conſcience / with only meates & drinkes / and divers weſſhynges and iuſtifyinges of the fleſſhe / which were ordeyned vntyll the tyme of reformacion.

                  And for this cauſe is he the mediator of ye newe teſtament / that thorow deeth which chaunſed  for the redempcion of thoſe tranſgreſſions that were in ye fyrſt teſtamēt) they which were called / myght receave the promes of eternall inheritaunce. ✚ For wherſoever is a teſtament / there muſt alſo be the deeth of him thatgala. iij. b maketh the teſtament.

                  It is then nede that the ſimilitudes of hevenly thynges be purified with ſoche thynges: but the hevenly thynges them ſelves are purified with better ſacrifiſes then are thoſe.

For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places that are made with hondes / which are but ſimilitudes  of true thynges: but is entred into very heven / for to appere now in the ſyght of God for vs: not to offer him ſilfe often / as the hye preſt entreth in to ye holy place every yeare with ſtraunge bloud / for then muſt he have of ten ſuffered ſence the worlde begā. But now in the ende of the worlde / hath he appered once / to put ſynne to flyght / by the offerynge vp of him ſilfe.

            He that ſayth he knoweth Chriſt and kepeth not his commaundemētes / ys a lyar. To knowe Chriſt is to beleve in Chriſt. Ergo he that kepeth not the commaundementes / beleveth not in Chriſt.
