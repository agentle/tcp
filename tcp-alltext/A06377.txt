               ALthough it bee their
parte which arme thē
ſelues firſte by their
owne priuate authoritie,
to gyue a reaſon
and cauſe of their
doynge: Yet the Lorde Prince of
Conde conſidering how muche this
preſent ſturre and tumult, by reaſō
of diuers circumſtaunces, is ſubiect
to many & ſondrie iudgemētes, beſides
that the common domage requireth
a ſure and ſpeedye reamedie,
thought it good to preuent al ſclaū
               derous
tales and miſreportes, and
to declare as here foloweth, the cauſes
whiche haue moued hym to aſſociate
hym ſelfe wyth hys kynſfolke
frendes, and ſeruauntes, for to do
ſeruice vnto the Kynge, to the

Queene, and to all this realme, in
their great neceſſitie and nede.
            Euery man knoweth, that after
the great troubles happened aboute
matters of religion (where with it
is moſte manifeſt that manye abuſinge
the naturall goodneſſe of our
kinges, haue ſerued their owne turnes
to eſtabliſhe & to maintein their
greatnes and honour). Finallye in
the moneth of Ianuarye laſte paſte,
there was and edicte or decree made
by his maieſtie, to rule and order
both the partes, with the aduiſe of
the moſt notable and beſt choſen aſſemblye
that the kinge coulde choſe
in all his parlements.
            This decre and commaundement
being ſhortly after publiſhed, in the
moſt part of the parlements of this
Realme, gaue a great hope of reſt
and quietnes as the effect declared:
and no doubt, if ye parlement of Paris
had not vſed ſuche a delay, the
tranquillitie of ye towne and of the
whole parlement therof had bene, &
ſhoulde yet haue bene muche more
then we ſe it now to be.
            
               
The let of this publication hathe
engendred by iuſte occaſion diuers
ſuſpicions, that that was not done
wtout great practiſe whiche tended
to a further ende, whiche thing was
cōfirmed by the goings & commings
and drifts of the prouoſte of the Marchauntes
of Paris, with the parcialities
that euerye man knew to bee
betwene the preſidents and counſailers
of the ſaid courte. Alſo yt all men
knew how the Conſtable being ſued
vnto and layed vpon by certaine
parcial Marchaūts had filled thē wt
a certain hope yt this decre cōcerning
religion, ſhould not continue long:
Notwithſtandinge, yt moued not ye
ſaid lord prince any thing at all, nor
yet others of the reformed churches,
to ſaye or do any thing that ſhoulde
trouble the cōmon quietnes of this
realme: but in the middſt of an infinite
number of violences & outragious
wronges wherof they could neuer
haue iuſtice, thei haue taried & loked
for the iſſue of the publication wt
the greateſt modeſtie and pacience
that they coulde.
            
               
This publication being made at Paris
with great, earneſt, and importunate
ſuyte, and rather by prayer
and requeſt than by the commaundement
of the king or of the quene.
The ſayd lord prince after a greuous
ſickenes, toke hys leaue of the
king and the queene, in hope to reſt
him ſelfe a whyle at his houſe.
            In the meane tyme newes were
broughte of the cruell and horrible
but cherlye ſlaughter committed at
Waſſye in the preſence and company
of ye duke of Guyſe, where were
moſt tyrannouſly ſlayne many of the
kinges ſubiectes, as well men as
women and children, whiche were
aſſembled togyther to heare a Sermon,
and to pray vnto God, folowing
the religion and pure worde of
god, which ye ſayd lord prynce main
tayneth with them, and truſteth to
mayntayne vnto death, by all meanes
lawfull.
            This cruelty thus reported at Paris,
moued in ſundrie wyſe, the one
partye and the other, in ſuche ſorte
that there was euen at that tyme

greate likely hode that ſome greate
miſchefe woulde enſue of it, the rumour
being ſpredde abrode that the
ſayde Duke of Guyſe came in armour
& wt a great company beyng
determined to roote vp and deſtroye
all the congregations whiche they
call of the newe religion, the whiche
alſo for their part, conſydering
that the kings decre and ordinance
ſemed not to be able to maintayne
them againſt the force, violence and
rage of their enemies, ſtode at their
defence hauinge firſte ſente to the
Quene certayne men of learnynge
and vertue, for to demaunde of her
iuſtice for the murder committed in
the ſayd place of waſſy. Thys was
the cauſe why the ſayd lord Prince
beinge at that tyme in good houre
arryued at Paris, for to goe to his
houſe, and deſyringe to remedie the
inconueniences that threatened the
towne of Paris, went at the commaūdement
of the Queene to meete
the king & her at Monceaux, where
he told them what he feared, and aduertiſed
them that for the auoyding

of trouble it ſhould be good that the
Duke of Guyſe whom men ſayd did
come with great power, and with a
great company armed withſtādinge
the kinges decree and ordenaunce,
at the leſt ſhoulde not paſſe through
the ſayde towne of Paris, whyche
thing was found good by the quene
and vpon occaſion ſhe wrote vnto
him with her owne hand.
            Now the ſaide Prince hoped that
the ſaid duke of Guyſe woulde haue
obeyd the Queene, and whiche is
more, that in laying a ſyde his weapons
would haue ſubmitted himſelf
with all his companye, to the order
of iuſtice equalye obſerued in this
realme, as well in the behalfe of the
leſt as of the greateſt when they be
accuſed of anye crime, and that he
woulde haue come ſtraighte to the
kinge and the quene with al humilitie,
according to his dutie: But it
chaunced clene contrary, for making
no other anſwere, but that he was
buſyed at Mantuil in feaſtinge his
frendes, he went ſtrayght to Paris
with a very great companye of hys

kinſfolke and frends, and ſeruauntes,
and others, with open armour.
And he may not go about to excuſe
him ſelfe for taking the ſaid armour
and gathering ſuche a company together
for feare yt he had of them of ye
reformed churches wc men call Huguenots
whiche is as muche to ſaye
as heretikes. For it is wel knowen
that before the murder at Waſſye.
he marched with weapons forbidden
by the kinges decree and ordenaunce.
Alſo that the moſt parte of
them that did accompany hym had
bene longe before called together
by him, and by others, out of al places
of this realme, ſo that longe before
there was no talke at Paris
but of that, and of his comming.
            Furthermore, knowing that thoſe
of the reformed churches tooke the
way of lawe and iuſtice accordynge
to their duetie, it appeareth playnly
that if he had not ſought but hys
owne ſaftie, he woulde haue gone
ſtrayghte to the courte accordynge
to the commaundemente of the
Kynge and Queene.
            
               
It appeared alſo, yt this comming
was practiſed of longe tyme before:
becauſe that not onely the company
of the Conſtable and diuers other
which in the meane time were
gathered togither, did ioyne themſelues
with him but: alſo the prouoſt
of the Marchauntes with a greate
troupe of the ſaid towne went to receyue
him, and this entrey was
made in open armoure with great
acclamation of men hyred and ſuborned,
as if the kinge him ſelfe had
entred in perſon. The Duke
of guyſe nor anye of his bande not
ſhewing any ſigne or tokē that thei
were diſpleaſed any thing at it.
            Nowe the ſayd lord prince beyng
retourned from Monceaux the daye
before, as is ſayd, fully determined
to goe on his iourney towarde hys
houſe, and being ſoddenlye aduertiſed
of the comming of the ſayd duke
of Guyſe with ſuch a companye and
route armed, determined lyke a
prynce of the bloode royall for the
ſeruyce of the kynges Maieſtie, and
the profite of the common wealth,

to ſee and prouyde for that whiche
the ſodeyneſſe of ſuche a matter required,
folowynge the prayers and
inſtaunt requeſt of an infinite number
of poore men, fearynge that it
ſhould happē to them as it did vnto
thoſe of Waſſye. And for this cauſe
& effecte, where as he neuer thought
of any ſuche thynge before, finding
in his company a certayne ſmal nū
               ber
of gentle men, then meting together
at Paris aboute certaine affayres,
profeſſinge the ſame religion
that he doth, prayed them to acpany
him to the preaching of godds
worde, appoynted and furniſhed as
muche as was requiſite for theyr
owne defence, wt all modeſtie, honeſtie
and ſimplicitie. And al this cō
               pany
was but .CC. horſe, compting
the gentelmen & ſeruāts of the ſayd
prince: others alſo there were dwelling
in the ſaid towne, haunting ordinarily
the preaching of the worde
of God, whiche wente and came
without offendynge anye man in
worde or deede.
            
               
The morowe after, bycauſe that
the ſayd Duke of guyſe in ſteade of
going ſtrayght to the court began to
fortifye him ſelfe more and more in
the ſaide towne, the ſayd lord prince
dyd alſo the lyke for the defence of
thoſe of the reformed church ye which
ſemed (with Iuſte occaſion) to think
that all the ſayde force and ſtrength
was againſt them, conſydering the
late deede of Waſſy, and that there
was in this realme no warre beſide
the common report, that men went
aboute to make at Paris a newe decree
formably contrary to the firſt.
            Beſydes all this, you muſte note
that the ſayde Duke of Guyſe, contynuyng
his courſe and trade with
the Conſtable and marſhall Sayncte
Andre and certayne other of theyr
companyons without the authoritie
of the Kynge and quene and whiche
is more, not making them pryuye
to anye thing, althoughe the ſtate
of the realme requyred not any extraordinarye
prouiſyon, kept neuertheles
his counſell ſtyll, wherin
ſate certaine preſydents of the court

offycers of the kinges, the prouoſte
and Bourgeſes of the towne, euen
as thoughe h
                  •
                had bene maiſter and
lorde of this realme. A thinge truly
very ſtrange, and ſuffycient to declare
and ſhewe, that there was amonge
them ſome practyſes and ſecrete
enterpriſes. For as for the conſtable
he was departed from ye court
ſyxe weekes before beynge greatly
diſcontend with the quene, bycauſe
ſhe would not endure nor ſuffer hys
ſtrang facions and maner of doing.
            And ſynce that tyme, for to reuenge
him ſelfe, beynge departed frō
his houſe to go to Paris to hold this
goodly counſell, mett the Kinge and
the Quene in the waye neyther ſaluting
them, nor yet ſtaying for them
made as thoughe he had not knowen
them.
            On the other parte alſo, the marſhal
of Sainct Andre not long before
theſe thyngs was not content to diſobeye
the expreſſe commaundement
yt the Queene had gyuen hym to go
furthwt to his charge of gouernemēt
but in the open counſel, anſwered

her ſo arrogantly and prowdly that
men might eaſely perceyue yt he leaned
vpon ſome counſell, and priuye
intelligence.
            More than this, the ſayde Duke
of Guyſe euen at the begynninge of
his comminge to Paris in ſteade of
going ſtreyght to the court, dyd employe
all the frendes he had, and
ſought all meanes he coulde to kepe
the Queene at Fontayne bleaux, for
feare ſhe ſhulde go to Orleans. Yet
neuertheles hauinge obtained that
whiche he had moſte inſtantly required,
he ſturryd not for all that from
Paris: and helped him ſelfe wyth a
newe excuſe, bycauſe that the ſayde
Lorde prince was there alſo accompanyed
wyth a greate number of
gentyll men, and that the towne
fearinge to be ſpoyled and ſaccadged
had deſyred and prayed hym to tarrye
there for to defende it, and thus

doynge he hathe priuilye rebuked
the ſaide Lorde prynce of to vilanous
an intent and purpoſe. But
the contrarye was ſone perceyued.
            For the ſayde lorde prince to take
from hym all pretence, or colour in
any thinge, by and by offred hym by
the Cardynall of Bourbon his brother
and gouernour of Paris to go
oute at one gate whan he ſhoulde
goe oute at the other.
            And than afterward being aduertyſed
that the Queene deſyred
that bothe the companyes myghte
goe oute, and that for thys purpoſe
the King of Nauarre ſhould be come
into the towne of Paris, he was
ſo readye and willynge to obeye this
commaundement, that althoughe
he had bene ſycke the ſpace of two
dayes in hys bedde, yet he departed
quyckely wyth hys companye
ſtrayghte towarde hys houſe of la

Ferte, from whence he hoped to
haue ſent them awaye incontinent
yf the ſayde Duke of Guiſe had done
the lyke.
            Nowe the ſayde Duke of Guyſe
cleane contrarye ſheweyng in effect
with hys complyces, that by the willing
departure of the ſayde Lorde
prynce, he had gotten that he loked
for, went to the Kinge with all hys
force and armyed power as in ye time
of warre and againſt his greateſt enemyes,
a thinge truly, not ſene nor
vſed, neyther is it in anye wyſe to
be allowed or accepted conſidering
the baſe and tender age of the king,
and that the Queene hys mother
althoughe ſhe be endued with a ſinguler
vertue, and conſtance could
not choſe but be a frayde, with a
Iuſt feare, ſeynge her ſelf beſet roūd
aboute wyth ſuche force and power
to gyther wyth the Kynge Duke
of Orleans, and my Lorde chanceler
contrarye to her wyll and expreſſe
commaundement, wherof

of ſufficient profe maye bee made by
the teares that fell from our kinges
eyes, and by the talke that he had
being forced to ſuffer him ſelfe to be
caried to Meleum theſe dayes late
paſt. The which it ſhall pleaſe them
to remember that were preſent. So
that ſuche a comminge of the ſayde
Duke of Guiſe, and ſeaſynge vpon
the perſons of the King, and queene
his mother, and of the Duke of Orleans
his brother, ioynynge herewith
all the foreſaid thinges, it can
not be, nor ought to be eſtemed other
than a takynge and captiuitie of
them, and that ye moſt hurtful, moſt
miſerable and ſhamefull, that euer
chaunced or coulde chaunce to this
Realme. And vppon this it maye
pleaſe the Queene (mother) to remember
the admonicion and counſell
that was gyuen her by a certen
Portugal, together with a man
of Spaine, & another ſent out of Sauoye,
as touching yt which ſhe nowe
at this day feeleth & findeth true, to
the great and extreme greefe of her
moſt obedyent ſubiects & ſeruaunts.

And to thintent that this may be yet
better knowen and vnderſtode of all
true ſubiectes and faithful ſeruants.
The ſaid lord prince beſides that he
declareth things paſt deſyreth al mē
to be aduertiſed of the enterpriſes
which is very eaſy to coniecture and
gather, which the fordſaid men doe
pretend to execute, to the intent that
if they be put in effect by thē, no mā
can doubte but yt they are very enemies
to the king and to his crowne,
and on the other ſide if there be other
let them haue ſo much the more certaine
meanes to declare & ſhewe it
in abſtaining frō ſuche enterpriſes.
That is, that hauing beſet, and then
caried to Meleum ye kinge, the quene
the yong duke of Orleans, and thoſe
which they thought good with armed
men, to enioye them at their
pleaſure they entend to helpe them
ſelues with their authoritie againſt
the ſaide Lorde prince, and all other
which withſtand and reſiſt theyr enterpriſes,
declarynge them culpable
of that which they them ſelues haue
alreadye partlye executed and done,

and whereof the ſayde lorde Prynce
neede not take the payne to excuſe
him ſelfe: ſeynge the experience and
profe ſheweth ſufficientlye that all
the dayes of his lyfe he hath myſlyked
and deſpyſed all that they haue
ſought and ſewed for, that haue growen
and encreaſed ſo ſone into ſuch
an honour & greatneſſe, that there is
none but Iudgeth with al the ſtates
of this realme that it is muche more
reaſonable to demande of them the
cauſe of it, than it can be eaſye for
them to giue a reaſon why.
            And if the ſayde Duke of Guyſe
with his, fynde themſelues vnfaulty
in this behalf, they ſhall do much for
them to purge themſelues of it according
to ye requeſt that ye eſtats haue
made therin, in ſteade of troublynge
both heauen and earth, and to gyue
this occaſyon to men to thynke that
they feare nothing more than to enter
into this matter.
            The occaſyon of that counſell
is euydente ynoughe, to weete
to the intente that all lettes
beynge taken awaye, they myghte

diſpoſe & rule the realme of Fraūce
at their pleaſure, and for aſmuch as
to attayne to theſe ende and purpoſes,
they knowe they muſte haue other
ayde and ſhores, men ſaye that
their drift and policie is, to roote vp
and deſtroy all thoſe of the reformed
churches, that is to ſay all thei that
reſiſt them, in makynge a certayne
newe decree at theyr owne wyll, by
the meanes of certain hyred and ſuborned
perſons, as well of the Parlement
of Paris as of elles where,
to the intent that the other parte
ſhoulde bee as it were indebted to
them, in ruynynge at the leaſt halfe
the realme, for to haue it rather half
at their deſyre, than to ſee it enioye
whollye the quietnes and reſte ſo
muche deſyred of all good men, and
as reiected of thoſe whiche neuer
made their profit but with the
loſſe and domage of another
man, and of the ruine
of the commons.
         
         
            
            THE
proteſtation.
            THeſe things conſydered wyth
many other whiche time ſhall
diſcouer yt ſaid lord prince proteſteth
this that foloweth before the
king, ye quene, and the ſtates of this
realme, with ye realmes, potentates,
lordes, frendes, and allyes, of thys
Crowne, and generally before all
Chryſtendome.
            Firſt that the onely conſideration
of that which he owyth to god and to
his churche, with the zeale yt he hath
particularly to ye crowne of Fraunce
vnder the gouernemēt of the quene,
and finally the hartye affection that
he beareth to the quietnes and tranquillity
of this realme, cōſtraine him
to ſeke all lawful meanes according
to gods lawe & mans, according to
the order and decre yt he hath in thys
realme, for to delyuer oute of Captiuitie
the perſō of the king of ye quene
his mother, & my lordes her children

and to maintain ye keping of ye kings
decres & ordenāces, and ſpecially vp
on ye matter of religiō, ſet vp, & made
by ye aduiſe of the princes of ye bloude
ryall, lords of the coūſel preſydentes
and conſelours of the parlements, ſauing
the ſaid men of ye houſe of guiſe
which now will truſt & beleue their
owne particular aduiſes. It cannot
fayle to be ſuch as mē ſe it to be if it
were no more but to iuſtify ye cruelty
more than barbarous, which was cō
               mytted
in the ſayd place of Waſſye.
Alſo the ſaid lord prince with a good
nūber of other prīces, knights, lords
of the counſel, captaines, gentillmē,
men of warre, mē of Iuſtice, & lawe,
marchants, and men of the three eſtates
of this realme, moſte affectuouſly
beſecheth and requireth with
all his hart all good faithful & truſty
ſubiects and ſeruants of his maieſtie
carefully and diligētly to ſee, reade,
and way al theſe foreſaid things, for
feare that leſt vnwares in ſteade of
ſuccoring and ayding the kynge
the quene & my lords her children, in
their captiuitie they be by ye practiſes

and falſe aduertiſements of the enemies
of ye peace & tranquillitie of this
realme, brought to be ye miniſters of
ye deſtructiō of ye ſame. And to preuent
and wtſtand theſe things he prayeth
them to help him and to ſtaye vp the
crowne of Fraūce now fallen downe
if god of his infinite mercy lifte it not
vp again whervnto after hauīg, called
vpō his grace he craueth ye aide ye
aſſiſtance & fauour of al kīgs prīces
and potentates alyes & confederates
of this crowne the wc he taketh al for
beholders wyttneſſes and Iudges of
his fidelite, & integryte, in the cōſeruation
of the ſtate of ye kinge, whoſe
inuocencye full of al good hope hath
not deſerued to be ī captiuity of thoſe
which by ye benefites of his predeceſſours
& fathers haue bene rayſed vp
in authorite, ſo that now they ſhuld
ſo manifeſtly conſpire ye ruyne of the
ſōne, of the quene his mother, & of al
the eſtates of this realme.
            Moreouer by thys preſent proteſtation
he meaneth wyth all his companye
to declare hym ſelfe pure and

innocent of the bloud ſhed and of the
calamites and myſeryes wherwyth
this realme is threatned throughe
the partyculare ambytyon of thoſe
which hauing nothing to doe but to
looke to the gouernement of thys
realme are comme vnto it them ſelues
by armes, for to chaſe them oute
whom both goddes lawe, and mans
dyd call vnto, and which were borne
counſelours. Againſt the violence of
the which diſtourbers and diſquyeters
of thys realme, breakers of the
decrees, and ordenances of all the eſtates,
he entendeth with al his companye
to beſtowe and to ſpend hys
body and goodes vnto his laſt breath
as a good and faithefull ſubiecte and
ſeruant of the crowne of Fraunce,
and ſpecially beinge of the houſe of
Fraunce.
            Alſo bycauſe the ſayde men wyll
not fayle to abuſe the auctorye of
the king and ye Quene whom they
kepe in a myſerable and vnworthye
Captiuitye, for to ſerue their owne
turnes agaynſte the faythefull and
truſtye ſubiectes of his maieſtie. For

this cauſe the ſayde lord prince proteſteth
and declareth preſently that
he wil not credyte any letters, meſſages
cōmandemētes, decres, ordenances,
whatſoeuer they be made by the
ſayde men vnder the name of hys
mayeſtie. For aſmuche as it is well
knowen that they ſhall be forced
and gotten by manifeſte violence,
agaynſt all lawe of God and man.
For, that accepted, the lorde prynce
wyl neuer giue place to any mā, lyuinge
in the humble obedience that
he oweth and wyll giue to his maieſtie,
and to the Queene hys mother.
            More, as touching the king of Nauare
his brother, the ſayde Lorde
Prynce proteſteth, that wyth the
band of brotherly loue, & ye particuler
reſpect that he oweth vnto him,
he meaneth to acknowledge hī after
the order and degree that he hath in
this realme, with all obedience next
to the king and Queene, whiche by
the common conſent of the ſtates,
the agrement of the Prynces of the
bloode royall, the approbation of

the parlements of Fraunce, hath receyued
ye gouernance of this realme
as alſo he is aſſured yt the ſayd kinge
of Nauarre conſyderinge theſe foreſayd
thinges will haue ſuche regard
to it as reaſon and the preſent neceſſyte
requireth.
            The which alſo the ſayd lord prince
moſte humbly and moſte inſtantely
beſecheth him to doe.
            Alſo the ſayd lord prince to ſhewe
that he ſpeaketh ſyncerly and truely
proteſteth, preſently that in ſteade
of comminge to hande ſtrokes he is
ready to vnarme him ſelfe vpō theſe
conditions folowing, whiche are ſo
reaſonable yt they cannot be refuſed
but of thoſe, that prefer their owne
gayne before the quyetneſſe of thys
realme. That is to weete, that the
king and quene, ye Duke of orleans,
my lord chauncelour, and other of ye
counſell be firſte of all ſet agayne at
ſuche libertie & ſafftye as they ought
to be: which thing cānot be done vntill
all weapons be laid aſyde vnder
