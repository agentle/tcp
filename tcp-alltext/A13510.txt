Preface to the Reader.

Imagin this Epistle to be the doore, and if thou please

Be it therefore knowne vnto all men, that I Iohn Taylor
Waterman, did agree with William Fennor, (who Arrogantly
and falsely entitles himselfe the Kings Maiesties
Riming Poet) to Answere me at a triall off Wit on the
seauenth of October last 1614. on the Hope stage on
the Bank-side, and the said Fennor Receiued of me ten
shillings in earnest of his comming to meete me, whereupon
I caused 1000 bills to be Printed, and douulg'd my
name 1000 wayes and more, giuing my Freinds and diuers
of my acquaintance notice of this Bear-garden banquet
of daintie Conceits, and when the day came that the
Play should haue been performed, the house being filld with

a great Audience, who had all spent their moneyes extraordinarily:
then this Companion for an Asse, Ran away &
left me for a Foole, amongst thousands of critticall Censurers:

by my foes, and in conclusion, in a greater p

            With that faire Countesse, and that Lady bright,
            Though where thou come thou shift & lye & lurch
            As welcome as a Dog into a Church.

            And more vnpossible then are all these
            It is that thou shouldst any wise man please,

            But I (to giue the Audience some content)
            Began to Act what I before had ment:
            And first I playd A maundering Roguish creature
            
            (a part thou could haue Acted well by nature)
            Which act did passe, and please, and fild their Iawe
                  •
               
            
            With wrinkled laughter, and with good Aplawse.
            Then came the Players, and they play'd an Act
            Which greatly from my Action did detract.
            For tis not possible for any one
            To play against a Company alone,
            And such a Company (Ile boldlie say)
            That better (nor the like) e're playd a Play.
            In breife, the Play my Action did Eclips
            And in a manner seald vp both my lipps.
            
               
Suppose it were a black Cimmerian night
            And that some 12 or 16 Torches light
            Should make night seeme an Artificiall day,
            And them suppose these torches past away,
            Whilst dismall darknes straight resumes the place,
            Then after all comes in with Glimm'ring pace
            A silly 
                  •
               aper. How would that alone
            Shew when the flaming torches all were gone?
            Eu'd so seem'd I, amidst the Guarded troope
            Of Gold lac'd Actors, yet all could not droope
            My fixed minde, for where true Courage rootes:
            The Prouerb sayes, once ouer shoes or 
                  •
                bootes.
            T'were easier to subdue wilde Beares or Bores,
            
            Or rowe to High-gate with a paire of Oares,
            Or to make thee an vpright honest man
            (Which sure God will not, nor the Deuill can)
            T'were lesser labor to blow downe Paules-steeple
            
            Then to Appease, or please the raging people.
            The Play made me as sweet in their opinions
            As Tripes well fry'd in Tarr, or Egges with Onions.
            
            
               
I, like a Beare vnto the stake was tide,
            And what they said, or did, I must abide.
            A pox vpon him for a Rogue sayes one
            And with that word he throwes at me a stone,
            A second my estate doth seeme to pitty,
            And saies my Action's good, my speeches witty.
            A third doth screw his chaps awry, and mew,
            His selfe conceited wisdome so to shew.
            Thus doth the Third, the Fourth, the Fift and Six
            
            Most G
                  •

                  •
               
            
            Would sure haue made thee vilifie thy breeches.
            What I endur'd, vpon that earthly hell
            My tongue or pen cannot discribe it well.
            And rather then Ile doe the like once more
            I would be married to an Arrant Whore.
            
            And thats a Plague, I could wish well to thee
            For it would worser then a Hanging be.
            And let 
                  •
               e say my best in my excuse,
            The Audience all were wrong'd with great abuse,
            
               
Great cause they had to take it in offence,
            To come from their Affaires with such expence
            By Land and Water, and then at the Play
            So extraordinarily to pay,
            And when th
                  •
                thing should bee which they expected
            Then nothing to their likings was effected.
            Their mirth to Madnes, liking turned to Loathing
            For when all came to all, all came to nothing.
            Thus hast thou had a little slender taste
            Of my designes, and 
                  •
               ow I was disgrac'd,
            For which I am beholding to you Sir,
            For had you come, there had been no such stir,
            Not cause the people long'd thy selfe to see
            But that they look'd thou shouldst disgraced bee,
            To see vs two the people did repaire,
            And not to see or heare, or Play or Player.
            Why what a faithlesse Rascall art thou then
            Dar'st thou to look

            But Ile Rib-roast thee, and bum-bast thee still
            With my enraged Muse, and angry Quill.
            And so I leaue thy Carkas and Apparrell
            Vnto the Hangman, who shall end our quarrell,
