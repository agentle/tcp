            To the tune of Priſſilla.
            
               IT was an old man, which with his poore wife,
               in great diſtreſſe did fall:
               They were ſo feeble with age God wot
               they could not worke at all
               A gallant ſonne they had
               which liued wealthily
               To whom they went with full intent,
               to eaſe their miſery
               Alack and alas for wo,
               Alack and alas for wo.
               ¶ A hundred miles when they had gone
               with many a weary ſtep
               at length they ſaw their ſonnes faire houſe
               which made their harts to leape:
               They ſate them on the greene
               their ſhoes and hoſe to trim
               And put cleane bands about their necke
               gainſt they ſhould enter in. Alack &c.
               ¶ Vnto the doore with trembling ioynts
               when this olde couple came
               The woman with a ſhaking head
               the olde man blind and lame
               Ful warily they did knocke
               fearing for to offend
               at laſt their ſenne doth frowningly come, Alack, &c
               vnto them in the end.
               Good folks qd he what would you haue here
               me thinkes you are too bolde
               Why get you not home to your country
               now you are olde and Lame
               With that they both replied
               wiſh ſorrow care and griefe
               Héere are we come to thee our ſonne
               for ſuccour and reliefe. Alack, &c.
               ¶ This is thy father gentle ſonne
               and I thy louing mother
               That brought thee vp moſt tenderly,
               and lou'd thee aboue all other
               I bore thée in this wombe
               theſe breſtes did nouriſh thée
               And as it chaunſt I often daunſt
               thee on my tender knée. Alack, &c.
               And humbly now we doe thée intreat,
               my deare and louing ſonne
               That thou wilt doe for vs in our age
               as we for thée haue done
               No, no, not ſo he ſaid
               your ſute is all in vaine
               Tis beſt for you I tell you true
               to get you home againe. Alack &c.
               The world is not now as when I was born
               all things are growne more deare:
               My charge of Children is not ſmal
               as plainely doth appeare
               The beſt that I can doe
               will hardly them maintaine:
               Therefore I ſay be packing away,
               and get you home againe. alack, &c,
               The olde man with his hat in hand
               full many a leg did make.
               The woman wept and wrong her hands
               and prayd him for Chriſt his ſake:
               Not ſo to ſend them back,
               diſtreſſed and vndone
               But let vs lie in ſome barne here by
               quoth ſhe my louing ſonne Alack &c,
               ¶ By no meenes would he thereto conſent,
               but ſent them ſoone away,
               Nuoth he you know the perill of Lawe
               if long time here you ſtay:
               The ſtockes and whipping poaſt
               will fall vnto your ſhare
               Then take you heede and with all ſpéed
               to your country do repaire. Alack, &c.
               ¶ Away then went this woful olde man,
               full ſad in heart and minde
               With weeping teares his wife did lament
               their ſonne was ſo vnkinde.
               Thou wicked child quoth they
               for this thy cruell deede:
               The Lord ſend thee as little pittie,
               when thou doſt ſtand in neede. Alack &c.
               ¶ His children hearing his father ſet
               his parents thus at nought
               In ſhort time after to haue his lands
               his death they ſubtilly wrought
               What cauſe haue we quoth they
               more kindnes to expreſſe
               Then he vnto his parents did,
               in their great wretchednes Alack, &c.
               ¶ They murdered him in pittifull ſort
               they wayde not his intreates:
               The more he prayd impaſſionately
               the greater were his threates
               Speake not to vs quoth they,
               for thou the death ſhalt die:
               and with that word with Dagger & ſword
               they mangled him monſterouſly Alack &c.
               When they had got his ſiluer and golde
               according to their minde
               They buried him in a ſtinking ditch
               where no man could him finde:
               But now behold and ſee
               Gods vengeance on them all:
               To gaine that gold their couzen came,
               and ſlew them great and ſmall. alack &c.
               ¶ He came amongſt them wt a great club,
               in dead time of the night:
               Yea two of the ſonnes he brained therwith,
               and taking of his flight
               The murderer taken was,
               and ſuffered for the ſame:
               Deſeruedly for their cruelty,
               this vengeance vpon them came.
               Alack and alas therefore,
               Alack and alas therefore.
