so wyde / that the whole Heauen and the vniuersall

Actes of the wonderfull Woorkes of God / were

Talking / before the Most highest / then
spake Testimony-of-trueth againe vnto mee / and

saide: Wonder not thou so greatlie at the great
Loue / Grace / and Mercie of God / extended ouer
the Children of Men: For God isIohn. 1. c. 2. Cor. 1. a. full of all
Grace and Mercie: but wonder thou rather that
the Man / in all thissame remayneth soEsa. 48. a. Ier. 5. a. 6. c. hardned

disdayneth the Louelynes of the Peace / or maketh
himself vnworthie of thesame: and euenso chuseth
to beare ⁏in the wicked Kinde of the vngodlie Beeing;
theRom. 2. a. 2. Tess. 1. a. Miserie of the Vngodlie. and to inherit
all Vnluck / Death / Hell / and Condemnation / Math. 13. d. 25. d. 2. Pet. 3. b. in
the hellish Fire / rather then thatsame louelie Beeinge
of God / which is proffered vnto him / in the
Seruice of the Loue.
               
                   9. Then saide I: Verelie ⁏my Lorde; Thesame
doth also cause me for to wonder
not a-little. But notwithstanding / albeit ther are
many Dispisers to be found / which contemne Gods
profferedPro. 1. e. 2. Cor. 6. a. Grace· his safe-making Seruice of Loue·
and his heauenlie WoorkesAbac. 1. a. Act. 13. d. in the Spirit· as also
the Testimonies of his holie Spirit of Loue (wherwith
they prepare the2. Pet. 2. a. Condemnation vnto themselues)
yet see I neuertheles / that ye Loue of God / 
and Fauour of Grace / remaineth still ouer the
Man: and that the Mans Destruction and Condemnation
(although the Man ⁏by reason of the
Iniquitie;Rom. 5. 8. a. is Gods Enemie)Eze. 18. c. 2. Pet. 3. b. is greeuous vnto
Him / ether pitieth him. For with ye great Pacience
of God extended ouer the Man / are theRom. 9. b. Vessels

of Wrath brought-fourth / to Condemnation. And
that is it which moueth mee for to wonder.
               10. Yet notwithstandinge / I reioyce mee also
againe / in the Mercie of God / and for hisEccli. 5. a. 2. Pet. 3. b. great

               11. Therfore trulie is thissame Time ⁏before all 
those which haue a right regarde thervnto; a pretious
and2. Cor. 6. a. godlie Time / of aboundaunce of Grace.
For I see / that God doth now in thissame Daye / 
accept or receaue the most-abhominable Sinners
⁏which are vnworthie of any Grace; verye gratiouslie
⁏Luk. 7. 15. b. in the Repentaunce for their Sinnes;
in his Loue / also forgeeueth their Sinnes / and
accepteth them worthy / for to liue with Him ⁏in
the Communialtie of the Loue of his Holyones;
inLuk. 1. f. Eph. 1. a. 4. c all louelie Righteousnes.
               12. This do wee now beholde ⁏right euidentlie;
with our Eyes / that God doth now ⁏in thissame
Daye of his Loue; set-vpp his louelie Righteousnes
amonge the most-abhominable Sinners. and
farder doth ⁏in the Seruice of his Loue; accomplish
That / which; in appeeraunce;Math. 19. d. seemeth vnpossible

verytrue / and a superaboundant Grace of God.
            
            
               The IX. Chap.
               
                  
                   O God / how bountifull art thou ⁏in
this Daye of thy Loue;The Laude and Magnifying of the Grace of God, thorough HN. ouer all those
which loue Thee / for thy Righteousnesses
cause! For those-same (albeit that
they haue inherited theIob. 17. b. Psal. 18. a. Condemnation ⁏in their
Conscience; for the Sinnes cause· and so feele or
tast the hellish Fire and all Indignation / euen-like
as ther appertaineth to the Vngodlie / or as they
are worthie of thesame) dost thouDeu. 32. d. 1. Reg. 2. a. Tob. 13. a. Sap. 16. b. leade-fourth out
of all their Miserie / and cleansest them from all
their Sinnes: lettinge them tast and feele the Delectable-sweetnes
of thy heauenlie Beeinge.
               2. Thou bearest also those-same before thy Bosom
/Esa. 40. 66. b in thine Armes: and bringest them / as thy beloued
Sheepe ⁏Eze. 34. c. Iohn. 10. b. whom thou hast founde strayinge·
and allured againe vnto thee / through the Seruice
of thy Loue; to the vpright constant Sheepe / in thy
Howse of Israel.
               
               3. Therfore must I yeat saye ⁏as before; that
God doth now in thissame Daye ⁏through the ouerflowinge
Grace of his Loue / and through the
Omnipotentie of his mostholie Beeinge; bringe-fourth
the Purest / out of the Most-vncleane / the
Liuingest / out of the Most-deadlie / and the Sauedest
/ out of the Most-condemned: and maketh euenso
of his cheefest Enemies / Rom. 5. b. his loueliest Frindes:
also bringeth those that were most-fardest from
Him, most-neerest vnto Him: and they which haue
ben ⁏ler. 2. d. 3. a. euen as vnfaithfull Members of an vnfaithfull
Espowsed-wife; most-vnfaithfull vnto Him / 
Those doth Hee now make faithfull / Ozeae. 2. a. and accepteth

or receaueth them for his Best-beloued.
               4. WHo shoulde haue thought that an adulterous 
whoorish Wife / coulde by anymeanes
Ier. 3. a. haue obtained such a Grace at her Husbandes
handes / as that Shee (inasmuch as shee
⁏with her whoorish Lustes and vnchast Desires;
had turned her awaye from her Husbande / Ezec. 16. 23. and
committed her Whordom with so many Straungers)
shoulde bee receaued againe of her Husbande
/ for such a beloued Wife. and that Hee
should let her knowe ⁏in the Seruice of his Loue;
so throughlie his Minde and Will: Yea / soIer. 3. a. b. to
hange or addict his Heart & Loue on her againe / 
as if shee had neuer ben turned-away from Him.
               5. Trulie / this is to be reconed for a speciall and
an aboundant Grace / wherin men haue greatlie to
wonder. For who should any-waye haue thought / 
that an adulterous Wife / shoulde in such-sort haue
ben cleansed from her Whoordom· and made so
faithfull and meete ⁏in the Obedience of the Requiring
of the Seruice of Loue; for to bring-fourth
all good Frutes?
               6. NOw with this my Wonderinge heereat 
/ I stayed mee in my Talke: but the
Sight of myne Eyes / was euermore fixed on the
great Reuelation of God: and I tooke good-heed / 
to all the heauenlie Sightes / that were shewed
vnto mee.
               7. But when I had a little heald mee still heerin
/ then spake Testimony-of-trueth vnto mee / 
and saide: Rest thyself now from all this Wonderinge

/ in thy Thoughtes: and take good-heede
vnto all that which is shewed thee heere / in the
Lande Pietas. For in thesame / God will yeat reueale
vnto thee and let thee see / manye secreat
Thinges / Esa. 64. c. 1. Cor. 2. a. which haue neuer ben seene of Mans
Eyes / nor heard of his Eares.
               
                   8. For-that-cause / Esa. 30. a. b holde thee still now before
the Lorde / and be bolde / and feare not: but haue
a good regarde vnto all that which becometh shewed
vnto thee heere / of the secreat Woorkes of God / 
that thou mayst rightlie knowe & well vnderstande
all thesame. For the Minde of the Trueth of all
thissame / shall not be kept-secreat from Thee / nor
from anye of all those which are one Heart and
Minde with thee / butMath. 11. c. Iohn. 14. b. be all made-knowen / and
declared accordinge to the Trueth.
               9. Heerwith I thanked the Lorde with Ioye / 
for all thissame great Grace extended ouer all People
that loue the Trueth: and I endeuoured myself
for to doo euenso / as ther was saide vnto mee.
            
            
               The X. Chap.
               
                   AFter this Sayinge of Testimony-of-trueth,
I looked-about ouer all the
Heauens / as ouer aEsa. 2. a. Mich. 4. a. very-great Mountaine.
Also I looked downe al-ouer the
vniuersall Earth. and beholde: On the Earth / 
ther were euery-wheare many littleEsa. 2. b. Hilles: as
also besides that / many Valleis or Lowe-places.
               2. Now as I looked vpwardes into ye Heauēs

I sawe by the Multitudes of manye Heauens / 
a very-mightie and stedfastEsa. 9. a. Peace / and aCan. 8. a. stronge
Loue / which was not to be broken nor rent. and
a faire Light of the Daye ⁏of an exceeding passinge
Cleernes; whichEsa. 60. c. Apo. 21. 22. a. neuer chaunged / and after the
which also no Night ensued.
               3. But as I looked downe on the Earth / I
sawe and heard by all ye Multitude of little Hilles / 
alwayes a great Sounde of a Hurringe-noyze / 
withMath. 24. a. 4. Esdr. 13. d. 15. b. much Variaunce and Dissention: And that
for the most-part / because that each-one of the little
Hilles, wolde inforce him to be the best and lordliest
on the Earth.
               4. Also ther was by them all / verie-little Light.
For those-same Lightes which they had by them / 
were all of little Light / and of small Power. and
also verye chaungeable into Darknesses. And for
that cause also / the Darknesses or Nightes / were
theare much-more and longer / then the Lightes or
Dayes.
               5. After that I had once throughlie-vewed 
these chaungeable Lightes / and the Vnpeaceablenes
and Stowtnes of the little Hilles on ye Earth / 
and considered well theron / I turned my Sight
againe to that one very-greatEsa. 2. a. Mich. 4. a. Mountaine of the
Multitudes of many Heauens / which were together
with each-other / so whollie peaceable and conformablie-vnyted
with the Godhead.
               6. NOw as I considered heeron / I sawe.
and beholde: This greatEsa. 2. a. Mich. 4. a. Mountaine
of all Heauens with the whole Deitie / opened itself

abrode verie wide and lardge: and ther-out
ther came One fourth / Apo. 12. a. like-vnto a Woman / whose
Bodie was eauen as a Gods Bodie / or as a spirituall
heauenlie Mans.
               7. Thissame gaue-fourth her-self so great and
glorious / that shee stretched-out her-self ouer all
Heauens / and also in all Heauens: and shee was
and remained consubstantiated with the Deitie / 
and with all Heauens. And with the Cleernes of
her Bodie, shee gaue-light in all Heauens / and
ouer the vniuersall Earth. for her Bodie wasApo. 12. a. in
Cleernes / brighter then the Sunne.
               
                   8. AFter-that I sawe / and beholde: Out
of thissame Woman / ther came-downe
from the great Mountaine / a very-strongeIob. 11. c. Esa. 57. b. and
vehement Winde / and blewe with a vehement
Power on the Earth: in such-sort / that the Earth
and all Hilles on the Earth / Psal. 18. a. trembled therat.
               9. Moreouer / this vehement or firce Winde /

them to small Poulder or Dust.
               10. This Dust spred-abrode itself ⁏as a drye or
barren Sande; al-ouer the Valleis or Lowe-places
/ and ouer all the Fatt-places of the Earth.

appeered vnto mee two Spirites / which also were
well knowen vnto mee. The one SpiritGen. 3. a. was / Searching-prouidence,
which did heere-tofore
⁏through much Riches of the Knowledge; reioyce
the Man / in his Vnderstandinge.
               3. The other Spirit was / Thaccuser, which
also in times-passed was a Iudge / in the Mans
Vnderstandinge: and for-that-cause / he dwelt in
the MansSap. 17. b. Rom. 2. b. Conscience. Wherthrough the Man
⁏when-as the Accuser approued his cause;Luk. 18. a. waxedprowde
⁏in his owne Righteousnes; very-often:
Againe of thother-syde ⁏when-as y•

him in his Conscience / or disalowed his cause; hee
became oftentimesSap. 17. b. greatly burdened ⁏in the Conscience;
with greeuous Straightnes or Distresse:
and so humbled hymself to all that / which was
iudged of him ⁏out of the Knowledge; to be right.
               4. MOreouer / As I was thus harkening 
with myne Eares / to their Sounde / so
heard I that Searching-prouidence spake / and
saide vnto the Accuser:
               
               5. I haue dealt or conuersated mee for a longe-time / with
the Man ⁏in his Vnderstandinge; in
the earthlie Beeinge: also gouerned him with almaner
of Prudence and Ingeniousnes of y• Knowledge:
Gen. 3. a. and therto ⁏out of thesame Knowledge;
taught him how to distinct or seuer the Good from
the Euell: and haue yet farder / let him enioye or inherit
thesame experymented Wisdom / as a Light.
And ther was neuer yeat anye Vnrighteousnes
founde in mee. For I am iust in all my Dealinges.
For-that-cause also / my Authoritie-in-gouernment
ought to be greater / then ouer the Mans Vnderstandinge
/ in the earthlie Beeinge.
               6. Heer-vnto answered the Accuser. and saide:
I haue also no-dowt / ben alwayes as a Iudge by
thee: andSap. 17. b. Rom. 2. b. accused the Man / in his Vnderstandinge
⁏when-as hee transgressed in any of all that
which hee admitted as Good ⁏through Thee; in y•

asscribed euenso the Right therin vnto thee. Wher-through
thy Power & Gouernment ⁏in the Mans

                   7. Then sayde Searchinge-prouidence: I
holde not myself contented / with thissame Gouernment
on the Earth. For ther belongeth yet greater
vnto mee / inasmuch as I haue preuayled by the
Man ⁏in his Vnderstandinge; with the Knowledge
⁏against Gods Woorde / and the Obedience
that God requireth therwith; and gotten as also
kept theGen. 3. b. Victorye therin in him / on the Earth.
               8. Inasmuch then as God hath alwaies inueyed
or set-vp himself against mee / on the Earth. and
yet hath not ben able ⁏hetherto; to preuaile against
my Wisdome out of the Knowledge / So haue I
now therfore made-vpp myself / out of the earthlie

/ equall with God; in the Heauen also.
               
                   9. Then saide the Accuser: Thou hast ⁏surelie;
right therto. For what hath God brought-in at
any-time / against thyne expert Wisdome / that
hath perseuered on the Earth? Or2. Pet. 3. a. where appeereth
that which hee hath promised? For Al-thinge
remayneth still in one State. Therfore go-fourth

not faile / in Accusation against God / to be alwayes
by thee. For to thee belongeth the Dominion in the
Heauen / like as thou ⁏through the Light of thy
Knowledge; hast thesame on the Earth.
               10. Then saide Searching-prouidence: For

For ⁏therfore;Math. 5. a. the Kingdom of the God of Heauens

Forasmuch as God hath now cleered himself / that
Hee knoweth not of any other Light more: as also
that ther should not be any other Wisdom more / 
but onlie his Light and Wisdom / So is therfore
my Request to your Noblenes ⁏yee honourable
Lordes; that God may haue the Fore-going / in
his Declaration: and euenso will I then ⁏in the
Vtteraunce of his mattier; take-heede vnto ye time
of my Declaratiō. and speake-fourth thesame (like-as
it shall also be founde right-true) according to
the Trueth.
               
                   12. Then saide the Lordes and Iudges: Goto
then / let it be eauenso. O God, it is vouchsafed
Thee / that thou shouldest first bringe-fourth the
Declaration of thy Right before vs. So let vs
now heare thy Declaration / to prooue that thou
hast right in thy Cause. And Thou ⁏O Searching-prouidence;
shalt turne thy Hearinge thervnto.
Wher-in then God hath right / that shalt
thou acknowledge to be true.
               13. If thou then be able to disaprooue thesame

⁏by alledging of any better and cleerer Certificatiō;
in any-poynt / therin shalt thou then be heard also
at-full. And in such Order shalt thou likewise let
vs heare thy Declaration / that thou hast to approoue
thy mattier right / So may wee then vnderstande
both your Cases· and yee both likewise / 
our Sentence ⁏that wee pronounce thesame vprightlie
/ according to the Trueth; in right-sort / 
To-thende that yee ⁏on both sides; may euenso
approoue and acknowledge all what is right / for
right· and also accomplish thesame.

               6. Beholde: All this wasGen. 1. a. Psal. 33. a. Pro. 8. c. Iohn. 1. a. made and ordayned
in such-sort / through my Light / Woorde / and

besidesEsa. 43. 44. 48. b. I myself? Or where is-ther an other
God / that can be like Mee / in my Light and Wisdom
/ and in my Woorkes?
               7. Therfore I affirme heere now for Right / 
that I am only God. and that also it-all whatsoeuer
is in Heauen and on Earth / ought to submit
itself and be obedient vnto Mee / in my Woorde.
ForExod. 19. a. Psal. 24. a. it is all / my Proprietee or Very-owne.
               8. AFter-that / Searching-prouidēce spake.
and saide: It is true: God hath made
all Thinges ⁏which Hee hath made;Psal. 33. a. through his
Woorde: but-yet not without Mee. For I myself
haue ben assuredlie (life as God himself hath
also heere affirmed) in all his Woorkes / the Prouidence
of thesame:Pro. 8. c. and haue foreseene it all vnto
God / ereuer that hee made thesame / To-thend that
Hee should make it all euenso / out of my Wisdom.

               10. I myself haue also first foreseene the Man

               The XXIII. Chap.
               
                   THen saide God. It is true: Prouidence
is the Eye or the Sight / and a
pretious Member of my Bodye: and
that I also ⁏through thesame; haue seene-into
Al-thinge ⁏ereuer I made it; well and a-right:
InGen. 1. 2. 
                        •
                     . like-sort also touching the Man / which I
made ⁏with Light / Trueth / and Prouidence; accordinge
to my Beeinge ⁏in all; like vnto Myself
/ to-thend that the Man should liue in Mee / 
and I in him ⁏with one Beeinge; for euermore.
               2. Had now the Man with the Prouidence / 
remayned standinge in my Woorde / Light / or
Beeinge: and not searched / for to knowe anythinge
more / So should also then likewise my Light and
Trueth / haue remayned still in the Man and in
his Prouidence. Also the Man should not haue
needed anye thinge more / for to search⁏curiouslie;
after my Light or Trueth / in the Knowledge. For
the LifeGen. 2. b. and also the Dyinge of the Death / was
sett in sight / before the Man and his Prouidence:
in such-sort / that ther was not anything wanting
to the Man / for to haue lyued in my Goodnes of
the true Light eternallie.
               3. But now / when-as the Man with the Prouidence
/ were fallen-awaye from my vpright Beeing
/ and the Light of my Life / Gen. 3. a. and had taken-on
to them the Searching in the Knowledge of the
Good and of the Euell: and that it went so euell
with the Man ⁏by that occasion; continuallie / 

So haue IIer. 25. a. 29. b. 35. b. sought vpon him ⁏with my Woord;
oftentymes / to procure him to the Obedience of my
Requiringe: and haue euenso infourmed him / with
my Light / To-thend that I moughtEsa. 55. a. Math. 11. c. ridde him
from his Miserie· and bringe him againe vnto
Mee / in the Light of my Life.
               4. Howbeit / the Man / seekinge alwayes his 
Life and Light of Wisdom⁏through Searching-prouidence;
out of the Knowledge / 1. Cor. 1. 2. b. could not so
knowe nor vnderstand my Light nor Wisdom / 
nether-yet the Obedience / which I required of
him through my Woorde. And is also by that occasion
⁏eauen vntill thissame Daye of the righteous
Iudgment; remayning in his Miserie:
nether coulde-ther also anyman els / deliuer him
therfrom.
               5. Therfore I affirme / that ther is none other
Light / Iohn. 1. a. but my Life: nor-yet any other Wisdom / 
but the Woorde of my Trueth:Psal. 33. a. Pro. 8. c. Iohn. 1. a. Wher-through
I haue wrought all my Woorkes.
               6. It is true: That which I haue made / I
haue ⁏out of the Prouidence which was of-one-beeing
with my Godhead;Gen. 2. a. made it-all well: but not
through Searchinge-prouidence, as to search
ther-after in the Knowledge / how it mought best☜
accorde or ioyne-together. but as I sawe-into the
vpright Fourme therof / in my Beeinge. And according
to thesame Fourme / Gen. 2. a. it was all good / 
what-soeuer I made.
               7. So is now therfore the Conclusion of this
my Declaratiō / to prooue that I haue not brought-fourth

my Light and Wisdom / nor-yet my Woorkes
/ through Searching-prouidence in ye Knowledge.
but as thesame stoode nakedlie before Mee
⁏in my Beeinge; according to the Trueth. Wherwith
I expresse sufficientlie ⁏and haue also before
expressed and prooued thesame; that my Cause is
right. and that I onlie / Esa. 43. b. 44 a. 48. b. am the Lorde and God.
               
                   8. SEarchinge-prouidence hauinge heald
his peace heer-at a little-while / spake afterwarde.
and saide: God is yet for-al-that vtterlie
vngrounded in all his Declaration / for to keepe
the Right and the Authoritie-of-gouernment against
Mee.
               9. For / inasmuch as I am the Sight of God / 
and the Principalst of the whole Bodie of God
(which thinge also God himself graunteth / and
must needes graunt ther-vnto:) and that I with
the Mans Vnderstandinge / haue alwayes ⁏thorough
the Searching in the Knowledg; sought the
Welfare of the Man / on the Earth· and brought-fourth
euenso ⁏out of thesame Light of the highlie-bosted
knowledgfull Wisdom; so manifolde good
Pollicies vnto Peace on the Earth / So will I
now therfore ⁏O yee noble Lordes; yelde-ouer my
Mattier ⁏which I haue heere in Cleernes / discouered
vnto your Noblenes; whollie into your
handes / for toPsal. 9. a. Act. 17. d. iudg thesame with Righteousnes.
For I haue such confidence in your Noblenes / 
that looke whoso hath right in his cause / him will
yee defende / and yelde him right in his Title.

               The XXV. Chap.
               
                   THe-whylst that this Trumpet was
yeat thus a-sowninge / so were the Lordes
and Iudges in a redines / for to pronoūce-fourth

the vpright Iudgment / accordinge to the
Trueth / and to sett the Parties ⁏to Concordablenes;
at-peace: and spake both-alike together / first
these Woordes:
               2. INasmuch as that God hath made his
Declaration / that Hee was from in Eternitie·
and in the Beginninge when-as Hee made
him ye Man / onlie the Lorde / Gen. 1. 2. Exod. 20. Esa. 44. b. the Life / the Light / 
and the true Woord and Wisdom itself: and euenso
foresawe it-all / what-euer Hee made. And that
Prouidence hath also declared / that hee first foresawe
all thinges ⁏according to the vpright Fourme
therof; vnto God: and that GodGen. 1. 2. a. made all thesame
accordinglie / So knowe wee very-well / that
all thesame is good. and that ether-other / in thesame
Cause of his ⁏when-as they both were yeat of
vnifourme-beeing / and stood vndiuided in one Beeinge;
hath well ⁏for the first; good right.
               3. But now / heere-betweene ther is a secreat 
Middel-wall entred-in / the which ⁏or what thesame
is; is not perhappes seene or espyed by eueryone.
For wee note / that in the Beginninge of the
Creation of Man on the Earth / ther was by God☜
and by all his Kingdom / and by all the Members
of his Bodie / great Peace and Concorde.
Howbeit after-that / when-as God had made the
Man ⁏on the Earth;Gen. 1. d. 2. b to an Imaige of himself ⁏as
a Life / of his Life / a Light / of his Light / and a Prouidence
/ of his Prouidence: and also out of hym / 
the Vnderstandinge / to an Healp of thesame Beeinge;
so became-ther aGen. 3. b. Ephe. 2. b. Middel-wall betwixt God

and his Imaige / like-as it in this present Day appeereth
before Vs. Through which Middel-wall
(which also may well be a Misvnderstandinge / 
wherby the one cannot vnderstande the other aright)
ther is likewise entred-in euery-wheare on
the Earth / so great Variaunce and Iniquitie· and
so manifolde Deceiptes and Falshod.
               
                   4. It is true: God hath heer-vnto / bestowed
alwayes great dilligence /

the Obedience of ye Requiring of thesame Woord·
and to his vpright Beeinge / wherby hee mought
be ridde from the Iniquitie· and liue in all Loue
and Peace.
               5. In like-maner: Prouidence hath also bestowed
alwayes great dilligence ⁏through Searchinge
in the Knowledge; with the Mans Vnderstandinge
/ for to bringe the Man into good Order:
and for-that-cause also (to-thende that the
Man should liue peaceablie on the Earth· and be

and assemble hym euenso againe / to his vpright
Beeinge [namelie / into thesame State /

eueryone had then / and all whatsoeuer is

Math. 16. c. Luk. 9. 14. d. Also forsake all that which is not of
thesame Beeinge / or proceedeth not therfrom.

Fore-goinge: Settinge thy-self in the

Last Iudgment / wher-vnto the Loue and her

Beeing / thou shalt also endeuour thyself / for to
sett thee ⁏accordinge to the Requiringe of the
Woorde of the Lorde and his Seruice of Loue;
