               IT is not vnknowne to ſome of you (deare brethren in the Lord) that for your ſake chifly I tooke paines, firſt to gather this breefe Sum: Therefore willing now to ſet it out and make it common to others: I thought good to recommend the ſame to you againe in ſpeciall, as a token of my good wil towards you all, and as a memoriall of my doctrine, and earneſt labours, beſtowed among you, and vpon that countrie, for the ſpace of ſixe yeares. Wherefore deſiring to heare of your profit, & fruites of my labours, I can not, but of very loue and duety, exhort you not onely to take this my labour in good part: but alſo to vſe it aright, leaſt it bee a witneſſe againſt you in the daye of the Lorde. It ſhall be verie comfortable and fruitful to you, if ye cauſe this ſhort ſumme to be oft and diligently reade in your houſes: for hereby ye your ſelues, your children, & ſeruants, may profit more & more, in the principall points of your ſaluation.
 What neede ye haue of this continuall exerciſe in your houſes, ye know your ſelues, and I by experience, can beare witneſſe, of the greate and groſſe ignorance of ſome amonge you: notwithſtanding the cleare light of the goſpell of long nowe ſhining there. In handling this matter, I haue ſtudied to my power, to bee plaine, ſimple, ſhort, and profitable, not looking ſo much to the deſire & ſatisfaction of the learned, as to the inſtruction and helpe of the ignorant. For firſt, I haue abſteyned from al curious & hard queſtions, and next I haue brought the queſtion and the anſwere to as fewe wordes as I could, and that for the eaſe of children and common people, who can not vnderſtand nor gather the ſubſtance of a long queſtion, or a long anſwere conſirmed with many reaſons. And yet if any will exerciſe their houſholde in the common Catechiſme, (the which thing I exhort all men to doe) this my labour can not hurt, but rather it ſhall be a great helpe to them, ſeeing I both gather the ſubſtance of the whole Catechiſme in fewe wordes, and alſo follow the ſame order, except a litle in the beginning and in the ende, where certaine things are added, which all men (I hope) ſhall iudge to be verie profitable,
 and neceſſarie to be knowne. There are alſo ſome queſtions & anſweres interlaced in ſundrie places, but chiefly in the matter of the Sacraments, which ſerue greatly to the right vnderſtanding of the matter in hand. But if men will bee both weary to learne the common Catechiſme, and alſo this briefe Summe: I can not vnderſtād, what good they wil haue to know the right way of their ſaluation. For certain and ſure it is, that the reading or rehearſing (by worde) of the Beleefe, the Lordes prayer, the Lawe, and number of the holie Sacraments, can profit nothing to ſaluation, without the right vnderſtanding and liuely application of the ſame to our ſelues in particular: in the which onely doth the true Chriſtian faith conſiſt. Wherefore I maruell greatly of the brutiſhnes of many, who doe glory in Faith, and yet neyther haue they knowledge, nor feeling of the principall heades of our Chriſtian ſaith, as their anſweres doe teſtifie, when they are brought to any publike examination. But albeit the greate multitud periſh in their wilfull ignorance, yet (I hope ſome ſhall profit by this my labour, taken for the Church of God, of the which I iudge you to be a parte. Therefore take heed to your  ſelues, and ſuffer no others to goe before you in this ſpiritual exerciſe: for great diſhonour it ſhal be to you, if others ſhal profit more by this breefe ſumme, then ye, ſeing for your cauſe it was firſt writtē, taught among you: and nowe laſtly vnder your name come to the knowledge of others. Be not of thoſe men to whome all kinde of good doctrine is eyther hard and obſcure, or els ouer baſe and common: for as the one hath no will to learne, euen ſo the other would be fedde with ſome curioſitie or newe doctrine. If any ſhal complaine of my obſcuritie in theſe ſhort anſweres, let him conſider how hard a thing it is, to bee both ſhort and plaine, or yet to ſatiſfie all mens deſire & iudgement in lighter matters, then this is. Alwayes if dayes bee graunted, I minde with the helpe of God, to make this ſumme more ample, & more plaine, if the brethren ſhall iudge it needfull. In this meane time, I deſire all men to take this my trauaile in good part, & vſe it to the edification of the Church, & glory of our God. To whom be all honour & praiſe, for euer aud euer.
            Amen.

            To the Reader.
            MEruell not (gentle Reader) that I alleadge no authoritie of the Scriptures, nor fathers, for the confirmation of this doctrine: ſeeing my purpoſe is not ſo much to inſtruct our prophane Atheiſtes and Apoſtates, as to put our brethren in memory of that doctrine, which they dayly here confirmed (in our ordinarie teaching) by the ſcriptures and conſent of the godly Fathers.
            Alwayes if eyther the brethren, or other woulde haue further confirmation of this doctrine, let thē reade the Inſtitution of M. Iohn Calum, and other godly men, who haue written aboundantly for the defence of this doctrine, according to the ſcriptures of God. I doubt not, but good men, and ſuch as are perſwaded of the trueth, will take this mine excuſe in the beſt part, and giue thankes to God for my labour, taken for their comfort. But as for the godles band of Atheiſtes and Apoſtates whom God hath ordained to diſtruction, I care not what they ſhall iudge of this my ſimple writing, & paines taken for the inſtruction of the ignorant. I woulde maruell greatly of the ſucceſſe of our doctrine, which is now impugned and purſued by men, (to the ſight of the world) of great eſtimation and iudgement, if the ſame had not come to paſſe to the Prophets and Apoſtles in their age, whoſe doctrine and religion was moſt faiſty impugned, and cruelly perſecuted by the Sonnes  of perdition. Of this we are forwarned by the Apoſtles, that men, after the witneſsing of the truth, ſhall depart to their vomit againe and become Traitoures and perſecutors of Gods trueth, which they profeſſed afore with vs. When we ſee this fierie tryall and fearefull iudgement in the Church, let vs examine our ſelues be time, and call to God for conſtancie in the trueth, and praiſe his iuſtice in the blinding of thoſe, that in ſo great a light, willingly and maliciouſly, delite in darkeneſſe and blaſpheme the way of righteouſeneſſe. Of this ſort are ſundrie of our nation, whoſe blaſphemous writinges come dayly to our handes, to the tryall of our faith and conſtancie, to the farther blinding of the reprobate, and their greater condemnation in the day of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. To whome with the Father and the holy Spirit, be all honor and praiſe eternally.
            Amen.

                     Q. Vpon whom doth he ſhew iuſtice?
                  
                     A. Upon all the reſt of Adams poſteritie,Rom. which are called the children of wrath.
                  
                     Q. When doth he this?
                  
                     A. Whē he ſuffereth them patiently to walke according to their owne corrupt nature.
                  Q. What followeth vpon that walking?
                  
                     A. Eternall perdition infallably, according to Gods eternall decree.
                  
                     Q. Doth God compell them to walke that way?
                  
                     A. No, but they willingly do embrace it againſt his word.
                  
                     Q. How can men willingly embrace the way to perdition.
                  
                     A. Becauſe they are blinded and corrupted by Satan and their own luſts.
                  
                     Q. May they embrace the way of life?
                  
                     A. No, they refuſe it neceſſarily, and yet freely without any compulſion.
                  
                     
                     Q. From whence commeth this neceſsitie?
                  
                     A. From the bondage of ſinne, wherein they were caſt by the fall of Adam.
                  
                     Q. Is all Adams poſteritie equally in the ſame bondage?
                  
                     A. Yes no doubt, but yet the choſen are redeemed through Chriſt, and the others iuſtly left in their naturall eſtate.
                  
                     Q. What thing then ſhall be ſeene perpetually in theſe veſſels of wrath?
                  
                     A. The glorie of Gods eternall and fearefull iuſtice.
                  
                     Q. What ſhall be ſeene in the veſſels of mercie?
                  
                     A. The perpetuall praiſe of his mercie and goodnes, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. To whom with the father and the holy ſpirite, be all honor and glorie eternally. So be it.
               
            
         
         
         
            A ſhort and generall confeſsion of the true Chriſtian faith and religion, according to Gods word, & acts of our Parliaments, ſubſcribed by the kings M. & his houſhold, with ſundrie others, to the glorie of God, and good example of all men. At Edinburgh, the xx. of lanuarie. 1180. and the 14. yeare of his raigne. (⸫)
            VVe al, and euerie one of vs vnder written, proteſt that after long and due examination of our owne conſciences, in matters of true and falſe religion, are nowe throughly re
               
                  ••
               lued in the truth by the word & ſpirite of god.
 And therfore we beleue with our hearts, confeſſe with our mouthes, & ſubſcribe with our hands, and conſtantly affirme before God and the whole worlde, that this is onely the true Chriſtian faith, and religion, pleaſing God, & bringing ſaluation to man, which is nowe by the mercie of God reueiled to the world, by the preaching of the bleſſed Goſpell, and is receiued, beleued, and defended by many and ſundrie notable Churches, & Realmes, but chiefely by the Church of Scotland, the Kings M. and three Eſtates of this Realme, as Gods eternall truth, and only ground of our ſaluation, as more particulerly is expreſſed in the cō
               feſſion of our faith, eſtabliſhed and publikely confirmed by ſundrie Acts of Parliaments, & now of a long time hath bin openly profeſſed by the Kings M. and whole bodie of this Realme, both in Citie and Countrey.
            To the which confeſſion and forme of religion, we willingly agree in our conſciences in all points, as vnto Gods vndoubted truth and veritie, grounded onely vpon his written word. And therefore we abhorre and deteſt all contrarie religion and doctrine: but chiefely all kind of Papiſtrie in generall, and particuler, euen as they are now damned and confuted by the word of GOD, and Church of Scotland.
 vſurped authoritie of the Romaine Antychriſte ouer the Scriptures of GOD, ouer the Church, the ciuill magiſtrates, and conſciences of men: all his tyrannous lawes, made vpon indifferent things againſt our Chriſtian libertie: his erronious doctrine againſt the ſufficiencie of the written worde: the perfection of the lawe, the office of Chriſt, and his bleſſed Goſpell, his corrupted doctrine concerning originall ſinne, our naturall inhabilitie, and rebellion to Gods lawe, his blaſphemie againſt our iuſtification by faith onely, our imperfect ſanctification, and obedience to the lawe: the nature, number, and vſe of the holy Sacraments.
            We deteſt his fiue baſtarde ſacraments, with all his Rites, Ceremonies, and falſe doctrine, added to the miniſtration of the true Sacramentes, without the word of God, his cruell iudgement againſt infants departing without the Sacrament, his abſolute neceſſitie of Baptiſme, his blaſphemous opinion of tranſubſtantiation, or reall preſence of Chriſtes bodie in the Sacrament, and receauing of the ſame by the wicked, or bodies of men, his diſpenſations with ſolemned othes, periuries, and degrees of mariage forbidden in the word: his crueltie againſt the innocent  deuorced.
            We abhorre his diueliſh Maſſe, his blaſphemous Prieſthood, his prophane ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the dead and the quicke, his canonyzation of men & women ſaints, calling vpon angels, or ſaintes departed, worſhipping of imagerie, reliques, croſſes, dedicating of Churches, alters, dayes, vowes to creatures, his purgatory, praier for the dead, praying or ſpeaking in a ſtrange language, his proceſſions, and blaſphemous letany, his multitude of aduocates, or mediators, with his manifold orders, and auricular confeſſion, his deſperate and vncertaine repentance, his generall and doubting faith, his ſatiſfactions of men for their ſinnes, his iuſtification by workes, his Opus operatum, workes of ſupererogation, merits, pardons, peregrinations and ſtations.
            We deteſt his prophane holy water, Baptiſing of bels, coniuring of ſpirites, croſſing, fayning, anointing, coniuring, his hallowing of Gods good creatures, with the ſupeſtitious opinion, ioyned therewith, his worldlye Monarchie, and wicked Hierarchie, his three ſolemned vowes, with al his ſhauelings of ſū
               drie ſortes, his erronious and bloudie decrees made at Trent, with al the ſubſcribers and approuers of that cruell and bloudie band, coniured againſt the Church of God. And finallye  wee deteſt all his vaine allegories, rites, ſignes, and traditions brought in the Church, without, or againſt the word of God, and doctrine of this reformed Church.
            To the which we ioine our ſelues willingly in doctrine, faith, religion, diſcipline, and vſe of the holy Sacraments, as liuely members of ye ſame with Chriſt our head, promiſing & ſwearing by the great name of ye Lord, that we ſhal continue in the obedience of the doctrine & diſcipline of this Church, & ſhall defend ye ſame, according to our vocation, and power, all the daies of our liues, vnder the paines conteined in the law, and danger, both of body and ſoule, in the day of Gods fearefull iudgement.
            And ſeeing that many are ſtirred vp by Satan and the Romaine Antichriſt, to promiſe, ſweare, ſubſcribe, and for a time vſe the holye Sacramentes in the Church deceitfully againſt their owne conſcience, minding hereby firſt vnder the eternall cloake of religion to corrupt and ſubuert ſecretly Gods true religion within the church, & afterward, when time may ſerue, to become open enemies and perſecutours of the ſame, vnder vaine hope of the Popes diſpenſation, deuiſed againſt the word of God, to his greater confuſion, and their double condemnation in the day of the Lord Jeſus. We therefore willing to take  awaye all ſuſpition of hipocriſie, and of ſuch double dealing with God and his church, proteſt, and call the ſearcher of all heartes for witnes, that our mindes and hartes do fully agrée with this our confeſſion, promiſe, othe, & ſubſcription, ſo that wee are not mooued for anye worldly reſpect, but are perſwaded onely in our conſciences through the knowledge & loue of Gods true religion imprinted in our hearts by the holy ſpirite, as we ſhall anſwere to him in the day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed.
            And becauſe we perceiue, that the quietnes and ſtabilitie of our religion and Church both depend vpon the ſafetie, and good behauiour of the Kings Maieſtie, as vpon a comfortable inſtrument of Gods mercie, granted to this Countrey, for the maintaining of his Church, and miniſtration of iuſtice among vs. We proteſt and promiſe with our hartes, vnder the ſame oth, handwritte and paines, that we ſhall defend his perſon, and authoritie, with our bodies and liues, in the defence of Chriſtes Goſpell, libertie of our Countrey, adminiſtration of iuſtice, and puniſhment of iniquitie againſt all enymies within this Realme, or without, as we deſire our God to be a ſtrong and mercifull defender to vs in the day of our death, & comming of our Lord Jeſus  Chriſt. To whom with the father and the holy ſpirite be all honour and glory eternally.
            Amen.

            I Thought good to adde for the better confirmation of this confeſſion, the iudgement of the ancient and Godlye Fathers, concerning the authoritie 
               of the holy ſcriptures, vpon the which only they grounded their faith and religion, and by the ſame onely confuted and condemned all contrarie doctrine and religion, in their time, as their writings do teſtifie to vs. And next I laye downe the open and ſhameles blaſphemies of the late Papiſts ſpued out, and written in contempt of the holy ſcriptures, and praiſe of mens traditions aboue the word of God, the which traditions they reuerence equally with the Scriptures, as it ſhall appeare by their owne wordes.

                  Idem, ibidem.
                   Let vs ſtand to the iudgement of the ſcripture, inſpired by God, & let the ſentence of truth be giuen to them, whoſe doctrine is agreeable to the heauenly oracles.
               
               
                  Cyrillus in Johan. lib.
                   12. All things, that our Lord did, are not written, but the Apoſtles wrote the things, they iudged to bee ſufficient for our maners and doctrine.
               
               
                  Baſilius, de vera Fide.
                   It is pride, to reiect any thing the Apoſtles haue written, or to adde any thing to their writings, & bring in things not written.

                  Ambroſius.
                   We iuſtly damne all newe things, which Chriſt did not teach, becauſe Chriſt is the waye to the faithfull.

                  Hieronimus, Pſal.
                   86. Take heed what they ſay that were, and not that are now: for whatſoeuer thing is ſpoken without the doctrine of the Apoſtles, let it be put away, and haue no authoritie.
               
               
                  Idem in Aggaeum.
                   The worde is Gods ſworde wherewith all theſe things are cutte off, which without the teſtimonie and authoritie of the Scriptures men of their owne head do inuent and faine, as traditions of the Apoſtles.

                  Irenaus, lib. 3. cap.
                   2. The Heretikes when  they are rebuked by the Scriptures, they turne to the accuſation of the Scriptures, as if they were corrupt, or had not authoritie, and that they are ſpoken ſundrie waies, and that the truth cannot be found by them, if we want the traditions.

               Papiſts acknowledge here your owne words, againſt the Scriptures, agreable to the olde heretikes your fathers.
               
                  THis was the doctrine of the Fathers, and Faith of the Church, for the ſpace of 500. yeares, after the aſsenſion of Chriſt. The which doctrine & faith, did piece by piece decaye, as the Romaine Antichriſt did growe to his high eſtimation, where through the true handling of the Scriptures was altogither neglected, and his
                  
                  traditions placed in their roome, & ſo the Pope with his creatures were placed aboue the Scriptures, to make Scriptures lawfull, or vnlawfull, & to be the onely Iudge of all interpretations, & their ſentence to be without all errour, and ſo all men bound to it, without any contradictions, as the hiſtories of the Church do plainly declare, but chiefely the bloud of the Saintes of God ſhed for the defence of this doctrine of the Fathers againſt their errours.

                  Hoſius Cardinalis, de expreſſo verbo Dei.
                   It is  vaine labour that is ſpent vpō the ſcriptures, we will rather waite for Gods ſentence out of heauen.
               
               
                  Idem, Ibidem.
                   What the Church doth teach, that is the expreſſe word of god, what is taught againſt the mind and conſent of it, is the expreſſe word of the Deuill.
               
               
                  Idem, Ibidem.
                   If a man haue the interpretation of the Church of Rome, albeit he ſeeth not how it agreeth, or diſagreeth with the text, this man hath the very expreſſe word of God.
               
               
                  Eckius, multis in locis,
                   The ſcripture is the blacke Goſpell, and diuinitie of Inck.
               
               
                  Herwaeus, de poteſtate Papae,
                   The Pope is the whole Church in power.
               
               
                  Uerractus,
                   The determination of the church is called the Goſpell.
               
               
                  Piggius, de caeleſti Hierarchia.
                   The Church hath power to giue to ſome Scriptures a canonicall authoritie, which they neither haue of them ſelues, nor yet of their authours.
               
               
                  Idem, Ibidem,
                   The ſcriptures are like a noſe of waxe, which may be turned in what ſhape and forme thou pleaſe to forme and drawe it.
               
               
                  Idem, Ibidem,
                   The Apoſtles wrote ſome thinges, not that theſe writings ſhould be ſuperiours to our faith, but rather that our faith ſhould be ſuperiour to them.
               
               
               NOw let all men iudge, what ſpirite mooued theſe godleſſe writers, to blaſpheme the Scriptures of God ſo ſhamefully. But ſome will ſay, they were priuate men, and not the Pope: nor his Councell. I anſwere: They were gladly heard, authoriſed, and well rewarded by the Pope and his corrupted Synagogue. And Io. Hus, Hiero. de Praga, with ſundrie others of our brethren cruelly were perſecuted with fire and ſword, for ſpeaking againſt their blaſphemies.
               It is true, the late Councell of Trent would appeare to iudge more reuerently of the Scriptures, when they hid their venom vnder ſome faire and generall termes. But which of them was offended when they heard the Biſhop of Poytiers in his exhortation call the Scriptures, a voyde & dumbe law, &c? And likewiſe, who accuſed the prophane Prieſt of Laterane, which in all their preſence, called the Scriptures dead Luk. &c?
               
               
                  Andradius writing in the defence of that prophane Councell, doth plainlye teſtifie, that they in their mindes did throughly agree with theſe blaſphemies, but yet durſt not ſpeake ſo plainly againſt the Scriptures, leaſt they ſhould haue prouoked the common people againſt them.
               And therefore to bleare the eies of the people for a time, they ioyne the Scriptures and their vnwritten traditions togither in their Decrees.
               
                  But in the meane time, they arme and ſend out certaine vile ſlaues, and godleſſe runnegates to ſpeake and write againſt the written worde, who doe call it a dead Letter, obſcure, vncertaine, inſufficient, the occaſion of all hereſies, written without the commandement of Chriſt, and vnprofitable to the people laboring hereby to bring the conſciences of men from the worde of life to their diuelliſh traditions.
               Let all men therefore that loue the trueth of God, flee farre from this deceitfull and diuelliſh companie, which God in his wrath hath raiſed vp to blind this vnthankeful age, and to trie our faith and patience, vnto the time of our full victory, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde. To whom with the Father and the holy Spirit, be all honour, praiſe, and Maieſty, for euer and euer. So be it.
