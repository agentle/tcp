            THE EPISTLE TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
            
               
                  I HOLD not for needful (good Christian Reader) to make any, large presace for thy instruction in that which is to ensue in this book the controuersy beeing sufficiently knowen by that which hitherto hath byn written and printed therof. The summe of all is this.
            There happened some 
                  •
               ew yeares past (as often also before) a certayne false all-arme of a Spanish inuasion,
                  An. 1598.
                then said to be vpon the Seas towards England, vpon the rumour wherof, one knight more hasty then the rest (for that he was of the Hastings) stept forth,
                  Syr F. Hastings.
                and offered not only a swift foot to the field (for so are his words) but a much swifter tongue to accuse, and bring in question all Catholike men within the realme, himself being knowne to be of the Puritan crew.
            And to performe this with more probability of iust occasion he made himself (without commission) a general VVatch-man ouer all the land, and wrote a most bitter and bloudy pamphlet against thesaid Catholiks,

vnder the title of a Watch-word replenished with all kynd of slaunders and most odious calumniations,
                  The VVatch-vvord.
                which being ioyned with the iealousy of the tyme, & the disgrace wherin the said Catholiks were before for confession of their religion, was very likely to haue brought them to some general ruine, and consequently this knight also to some desired diuident of their liuings.
            VVherfore this intemperate inuectiue comming to the hands of a certaine Catholike man that took compassion of their oppression, and some disdayne at the malitious deuise of this watch-man, he thought good to write a temperate Ward-word to this 
                  •
               urbulent watch-word,
                  The VVard-vvord.
                drawing all that the other had vttered in many wyld & wast words into 8. seueral Encounters, intituling his book a Ward-word; which being published it seemed to touch the matter so to the quick as the first newes after the publication therof was in most mennes mouthes, that the knight disauowed the watch-word, attributing thesame rather to certayne ministers of his communion, that eyther wrote the same or induced him therunto, then to himself, & most men commended the discretion and modesty of the knight in so doing.
            But as men are not alwayes constant in the best; so Sir F. making a new consultation with his presbitery at Cadbury, took another resolution to reply againe vnder the name of An Apologie,
               
                  The nevv reply of Sir F.
                & heerby the matter hath growne to a larger discussion then was expected, for that the book (after long expectation of more then two yeares) comming to my hands, I was drawne to enlarge my self much more in this my reioynder,

then at the beginning I purposed: in so much as hauing ended the whole answere, with in few monethes af
                  •
               er the receit of the book, it grew to such a bulk, as conueniently it could not be set forth in one volume; and this was one cause of some delay & longer deliberation.
            But another more principal was, an aduise written vnto me,
                  O. E. his book.
                that one O. E. a minister had published another volume of thesame argument in supply of the knights defence, much more intemperate & malignāt, then the other; which being vnderstood, it seemed necessary to expect thesame before the publishing of the former, which hath caused much longer delay then was wished or meant, especially some other impediments also cōcurring therewith, wherof most men cannot be ignorant.
            Now then these being the causes of the enlargemēt both of tyme and matter, it seemeth I should tel yow also of the reasons, why these two first Encounters are set forth a part from the rest; but this is sufficiently declared by a certaine addition in the end of this book set downe by the publisher therof, wherunto I remit the reader, only I am to aduertise him to consider how easily words do beget words, and how a few lauish speeches spoken at rādome by the knight in his watch-word haue giuen an occasion to the handling of aboue fifty controuersies in these first two Encounters only; and then may yow imagine how much more the rest may amount vnto.
            And one principal reason of this encrease & growth is,
                  The causes of enlarging this Treatese.
                for that our aduersaries do handle matters of religion so confusedly, and with so litle order, sincerety or

truthe, that we must eyther shuffle ouer things as they do, scarce vnderstood eyther by themsel
                  •

               me method and perspicuity to spend much tyme & labour, to explicate, and distinguish thesame, and to yeild to eache thing his true ground, reason and probation; which point, for that I had rather the reader should learne by proof and experience of the things themselues here to be handled, then by my spech, I wil proceed no further; but remit my self to the insuing treateses, beseeching almighty God that all this may redound to his glory and to their good for whose spiritual benefit I haue most willingly taken this smalle playnes.

            AN ANSVVER TO A CERTAYNE VAYNE, AND ARROGANT EPISTLE OF O. E. minister, vnto N. D. author of the Ward-word.
            
               SMall contentment (gētle reader) can any Christian modest man take, that hauing to handle a graue & serious cause seeth himselfe drawne, or rather driuen from thesame, to contention of wordes, by the insolencie, and importunitie of his quarrelling aduersarie,2. Tim. 2. which tēdeth to nothing (as the Apostle also noteth) but to the subuersion of the hearer, and yet when we are forced to this disorder somwhat also must be sayd least silence in speach shew diffidence in truth, and that a foole (as the Scripture insinuateth) if he be not answered in his folly begin to thinke himself wyse.Prouerb. 26. We haue signifyed before in our preface, how a certayne contentious minister desyrous to be doing, and to play a parte, but yet not without a visard in respect of the follyes perhaps he was to vtter, resolued to mask, and cypher his name vnder the letters of O. E. and then hauing pervsed the reply of S. Frācis Hastings to the Ward-word, and misliking (as it seemeth) the same as insufficient he b

            Now 
                  •
               hen letting passe this, we shal looke into the argument of this present Epistle of O.E. to N.D. which yow shal see to consist of three principal poynts,T

                  his Epistle. to wit, notorious folly, apparant falshood, & ridiculous vanitie, in bragging & vaūting, let vs see them all in order.
            
                This Epistle prefixed before his booke hath this inscription, To N. D. al

                  as Noddie, O. E. vvisheth knovvledge of truth, &c. and then beginneth he his Epistle thus; Sir N.D. or Noddie, or hovvsoeuer it shal please yovv to style your selfe, being a man but of tvvo or three letters, &c. Hee
                  •
               e yow see beginneth a graue contention betweene O. E. and N. D. about the worde Noddie, which none but a Noddy, in my opinion would euer haue brought into examination, especially in print; 
                  •
               or that N. D. being but consonants, and hauing no sound of their owne cannot make Noddie, exc

                  •
               . must needs be the formal Noddie, and that N.D. doth but lend him a coople of consonants to make him a Noddie, and thus much for the name it selfe. But as for the nature, and essence of a Noddie to which of the two it doth best agree shal appeare afterward in the discussion of matters throughout this whole combat, and one poynt of a Noddie yow may presentlie perceaue in these verie words alleadged, wheras O.E. obiected to N.D. that he is a man but of two or three letters, which is answered sufficientlie by numbring onlie how many letters O. E. do make, and so agayne afterward, and verie often in his repli
                  •
               , he obiecteth to N. D. that he durst not put downe his name at length, which yet himselfe being at home vpon his owne ground and among his owne frends, and fauourers, thought best not to doe, and consequentlie we must conclude, that as Cicero doth call him a Noddie oratour,Cicero lib. 1. de oratore. which alleadgeth such matter, as maketh no lesse for his aduersarie, then for him selfe, so may we hold O.E. for a Noddie writer, who obiecteth that to N.D. which with farre lesse reason, or excuse he practiseth himselfe, and thus much about the iest, and allusion of Noddie, wherin while the minister would needs be pleasant he is now become ridiculous.
            About the second poynt which is of his apparant falshood albeit we might remit our selues to the  multitude of examples which we shalbe forced to lay downe in our insueing incounters, yet one shal we shew heere, for a proofe of the ministers talent in this kynd; He will needs in this Epistle interpret the letters N.D. to import Robert Persons, and consequentlie, that he was the Author of the Ward-word,

for whose discredit he telleth vs, that the same man hath written in all eight contemptible treatises, which he taketh vpon him to register, and number vp: The first being (as he sayth) certayne chart

               cke. The Epistle of persecution. And the christian directorie, or booke of resolution; So as in recounting vs heere eyght bookes the minister telleth

nyne lyes, foure positiue, and fiue priuatiue, no lesse falselie affirming the one then fraudulentlie suppressing the other, which being discouered at this his first entrance to his answer, and not being able to be excused, each man will see how litle truth, or conscience he hath, and how litle he is to be trusted in any thing els that he sayth or writeth.
            The third poynt is of his ridiculous crowing, vaunting and chalenging, as though he were not  only that Terentian Thraso, or Philistian Goliath, but euen Behemoth, or Leuiathan himselfe whose lips (as the Scripture sayth) do cast foorth burning lampes,Iob. 41. and his nostrels fyerie smoke, who esteemeth iron as straw, and contemneth brasse as rotten wood, which is spoken of a proud cōtemptuous spirit discouered euery where in this fellow, not only by his fuming, fretting, and f

               cing throughout this ydle Epistle, but by his contumelious words, and reprochful speaches also in all other partes of his writing, prouoking and chalenging as a gyant, and yet when he cometh to grypes he sheweth himselfe one of the poorest, and weakest wormes, that euer lightlie hath come to combat in these affayres as after yow wil fynd by experience, now let vs heare him a litle cracle if yow list.

            CERTAINE BRIEF NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS VPON SIR F. HAStinges Epistle to the Christian Reader.
            
               THOVGH whatsoeuer Sr. F. wryteth in this Epistle be  handled afterward more at large in the seueral Encounters thēselues that do ensue, yet to let nothing passe wholy vnanswered, and to discouer somewhat in this beginning, the talent which the K. hath in wryting, I haue thought best to set downe these fewe annotatiōs cōcerning the principal points, (though none indeed be principal or material) of his said Epistle to the Christian Reader.
            First of all he beginneth the very first paragraphe  of his Epistle with such obscurity or deep mistery,Epist. pag. 1. as I confesse I vnderstand him not; for thus he sayth: Hauing obserued (gentle Reader) from the words and wrytinges of the learned, that it is a maxime,

                  ning it is not vnlike, that like a conning Clarke (whatsoeuer his learning be) the end of this his worke, was the first ground of his wryting.
            
            Thus he wryteth and yf the Reader vnderstand his meaning, and what he would cō
               clude, it is wel, for I professe my ignorance therin, only I know the Philosophers maxime to be this:Aristo

                  oing any thing is first in our intention, so is it last in preformance and execution. The later part our K. hath left out, the former I know not why he hath brought in, except perhaps his hidden conceyt should be, that the last part of my Wardword (which is the remission to the Lords of her Ma•ies. Counsel) was the first thing intended by me, and inducing me to wryte, which yet is euidently seene to be false, for that the K. Wachword and iniuryes offered therin to Catholikes was the motiue, inforcing rather then inducing to that worke, and to oppose my ward to so slāderous a watch: so that heer S.F. his Philosophical Maxime is fondly applyed, or not applyed at all, and consequ

            But for the second which he obiecteth that I seeke the ruyne both of Church and comon wealth by my exhortation to peace, atonement and mitigation in religion which afterwards goeth in my remitter to the Lords

of her Mat•es. Counsel, their Honors and not Sr. F. worship, or wisdome must be iudges of this poynt: and why an exhortation to peace and vnion should be accounted a cause of publyke ruyne I see no cause; nor yet reason of state or religion therin, except the knyght & his puritanical camp do hate peace; following therin that other Maxime, that in troubled waters is best fishing. Which coniecture is shrewdly confirmed by the attempt of their Puritane Captaine the Earle of Essex (brought by puritanisme into suche calamitie) who hauing byn stout against peace with forrayne Princes for diuers yeares,The Earle of E

And whether Sr. F. were one of those anglers or no, I cannot tel, being so farre absent, nor wil I accuse him, though he being of the sermon-sect, and exercising society, which vnder that occasion and pretence layd their hookes to this troublesome and daungerous fishing, it may be presumed he liked wel inoughe the matter, though, perhaps not the manner, and so til a new captayne be found, the enterprise mustly raked vp in the ashes, and out cryes be giuen againe against Catholykes as the only men, that by peace vnion and pacification do seeke the ruyne both of Church and common wealth.

            The rest that followeth in his Epistle is of no moment, vntil he come to delight himselfe somwhat with a certayne fensing allusion, to the title of the ward-word, saying: I doubt not, but so to breake the strength of all your cheefe wards (for all your fensing skil as to leaue yow at length to your hanging ward,

                Lo heer, threates that go before arguments, wherin I confesse both him and his to be very eager and sharpe assaylants, and that no fencers, nor swashbucklers, nor cutters (as they cal them) of Queene hiue or other kilcowes could euer follow the fray more sharpely vpon Catholikes, then he and Topclif and such other haue done, for these many yeares, by hanging so many Priests and other seruāts of Christ, that haue rested vpon this hanging ward of patience and suffering for ancient religion; which ward yet hath prooued much more glorious then dangerous to them, their hope and assurance depending of the promise inuiolable of their Captaine and Master, assuring them vpon his honour and power, that no one heare of their head shal perish, which they haue seene performed in all former suffering and martyrdomes for the

same cause, and so do hope it wilbe in thē, for which respect they cōtemne easily, whatsoeuer the malice of mā can worke against thē. And so (Sir) your bloody iest of hāging ward, returneth to yow againe, without applause of any that hath feeling of piety or humanity.

Here is first to be noted that our K. by no meanes can be forced throughout all his whole book to declare himselfe cleerly, whether he be of the Puritan faction or no, only in this place he would fayne deny (as yow see) all difference of those names & professiōs, which being ridiculous to all English (euen children) that know the contrary (and I am to shew it largely afterward in the very first Encoūter) Cap.

                  .yet he blusheth not to deny it heer, yea further he endeauoreth to proue yt by a strong demonstration saying: that both of them do professe Christ Iesus crucified in religion. But graunt that Christ be crucified againe in their religion and that both protestant and puritan do conspire therin, is this sufficient to proue them both to be of one religion? And do not all the Anabaptists, Trinitarians and other sectaryes of our tyme confesse the same, that is Christ to haue byn Crucified? also in their religion? Yea all the old heretikes,

except only such as denyed the manhood of Christ; did confesse Christ crucified? And we Catholykes in like maner (whome yet he reiecteth as most opposite to him and his) do we not professe that Christ was crucified? how then is this agreement in Christ Iesus Crucified brought in for a sufficient argument of their vnity in beleefe and Doctrine?A foolish argument of agreemēt betvvene Protestants & Puritans. Consider (good reader) what notable arguments yow are like to haue in the rearward and rest of his book, seing these and other like are put in the vauntgard.

               to the holding out stil of the Popes vsurped authority, &c. Heere are two apparant abuses,Calumniation and flattery. calumniation, and flattery. calumniation in that the Encounterer nameth not her Ma•e•. many yeares by way of vaunt, but by way of sorrow and compassion to the Realme & comon-welth. The flattery consisteth in that the K. wil needes persuade her Mat•e. of holding out stil, which as euery man desyreth to be long, yet this (stil) is so grosse and palpable a flattery as no man of iudgment and grauity can but scorne him for yt, especially since the Essexian assault, which may be presumed would haue abbreuiated this (stil) yf it had preuayled, if not in the Earles own intention, yet in many other of the puritan hot brotherhood▪ that egged him on to this attempt.
            
               A litle after when I persuade to vnion of hartes and good willes in England by tolleration and mittigation in matters of religion, he (as though there were no need therof) answereth thus: As for his vnity, yf yt be vnity in verytie (as his is not) no Christian man can or wil refuse that,

Heere yf by (we) he vnderstand all his new gospel brethren, to wit Lutherans, Suinglians, English Protestants and Puritans (as in the rest of his booke he holdeth them for true brethrē) then how this (we) do agree in vnity of verity all men that haue eares or eyes, do heare & see, which matter yet shalbe examined more largely in the first Encounter cap. 3.4 5. & 6. following where our knight doth assigne it for the first and most special blessing of their religion to haue this good vnity in verity amonge them.
            But in the meane space, for that he doth seeme to restrayne his speech somwhat in this place to Englād alone, by saying, that they enioy it already by and vnder her Matie.

               uenient, then to suffer both religions to stand togeather, as at this day in Germany, France, and other places, where both sortes are found to be permitted for greater peace and concord of the common-wealthes; And why then should our K. so much feare ruine therby to his religion in England, except only for the causes before cyted.
            Towards the end of his Epistle he hauing censured myne intention, as before yow haue hard, he setteth downe his owne very confidently in these words: Being called, as it were, into the field by him,
               Ibidem. 
               I haue aduentured vpon the height of his swelling pride, and haue shaped him a plaine and sound answere to the material poyntes, &c. wherby I hope (Christian Reader) thow shalt fynd me cleared and free from the force and fury of his false imputations and byting blowes, &c.
            
            Heere for that he remitteth the matter to the Christian Reader, I am very wel content to subscribe to the same remission, who first of all must needes iudge for me, & condemne

him in the very first words that he alleageth, to wit that he was called into the field by me, wheras his Watchword being the first chalenge that sounded the trompet of warre,Manifest vntruthes impudently auouc

And heere I would aske how farre this is from impudency? and yet according to the same sute do follow the rest, that is to say: of my swelling pride, of his playne and sound answere shaped to all material poynts: and that he is fully cleered from all imputations of falshood, &c. For yf my pride be no more swelling, then his mishaped answere is sound and material, I may thinke my selfe a very hūble man. And yf in Westminster halle S. F. should be accused of treason or felony or other greiuous criminations (as many Catholike Priests are vpon lesse occasion) and should cleere and free himselfe no better therin, then here he doth in this reply, from imputations of falshood, he might quickely expect both iudgment and execution, and consequently himselfe be driuē to that hanging ward, which heere he threateneth to driue vs vnto.
            And lastly wheras he wryteth for the cō

            OTHER OBSERVATIONS VPON THE PREFACE OF O. E. TO THE REAder conteyning a ful answere therunto.
            
               
               AS I haue made before some annotations and obseruations vpon Sir Frācis Hastings Epistle to the reader, so may I not altogether pretermit this preface of O. E. which is somwhat more spised with poyson, and venome then the other, tēding wholy to bloodshed, and cruelty against Catholikes: the man I haue somwhat dismasked before in my answere to his opprobrious letter, to N. D. whom he enterpreteth Noddy: heer we shal hādle the proiect and purpose of this his writing, which indeed is nothing els,O. E. his plot and proiect. but to irrite, and styrre vp her Maiestie and her honorable counsel with the rest that s
                  •
               and at the sterne of gouernment, to ingulf themselues in Catholikes blood, and spoyle of their goods; wherby hee, and his hungry crue standing by, and for desyre therof licking their lips might hope to come to haue some share in the deuidend,O. E. vvatcheth for scrappes. and yet for auoyding publike hatred, & notorious shame he desyreth to entertayne himselfe in some darkenes for a tyme and to expect his pray vnder the shroud of a cyphred O. E. name, for as

he said which knoweth wel such compagnions, qui malè agit,
               Io. 3. vers. 10. 
               odit lucem, & non venit ad lucem vt non arguantur opera eius, he that doth naughtely hateth the light, and wil not come to it least his workes may be conuicted, but yet we must drawe this Owle to light, and see what he sayth vnder the vizard of O. E.
            His drift in this Epistle, and in his whole writing  is to styr vp the state to set vpon some new affliction of Catholykes reioysing & clapping his hands, where any rigour is in vre already, and to this barbarous purpose he deuiseth diuers impertinent, and ridiculous meanes of persuasion, which I shal runne ouer with as much breuitie, as they are voyd of substance, wit, reason, or honestie.
            His first meane of persuasion is by extolling exceedingly  the extraordinarie clemency vsed hitherto in England towards Catholykes,Rare clemē
                  cy tovvards Catholykes. which clemency he sayth hath byn most singuler, and admirable, and to proue this (leauing all home testimonyes) he runneth into Italy to seek a witnes, bringing foorth one Petrus Bizartus in his story of Genua,
               Pet Biz. lib. Hist. Gen. 33. Pres. pag. 1. who sayth, that for the first 20 yeares of her Maiesties reigne no blood vvas shed, nor any suffered to be punished but by lavvful tryal and sentence of Iudges, &c. But what need was there to go so farre to fetch so slender à testimony? this fellow wrote a 1000. myle of, and telleth vs only that there vvas no bloudshed, nor punishment vvithout some sentence of Iudges or lavvful tryal for the first 20 yeares. And what then for the second twenty? shal we inferre (as it seemeth we must) that for these later twenty yeares bloudshed hath byn vsed without lawful tryal or sentence of Iudges? and doth not our minister shew himself more then Bizarro in Italiā a light & phantastical head. 
               Bizarro (I speak to him as vnderstanding the Italian tongue) for bringing in Bizarus to so fond a purpose? so that by this yow may take a scantling of the mannes discretion

at the very first entrance, yow shal see it more in the next and other poyntes that do ensue.
            
                For as in this first poynt he would make Catholikes to seeme vngrateful, for that hauing receyued so singuler clemency, they complayne of rigour, & therby deserue to be punished more, so in the second poynt he beginnes to treat of their moouings against the stare wherby he would haue them much more to deserue punishment, and his entrance to this treatise is in these wordes:Ibid. pag. 1. 
               In the meane vvhile Thomas Harding obteyned a Bul from the Pope to exercise Episcopal iurisdiction in Englād, to dispence vvith irregularities, and to receyue all that vvould be reconciled to the Pope.
            
            And then he noteth in the margent anno Domini B567. by which entrance also we may be much confirmed in our former cōiecture of our mannes deep wit, seing that at the very beginning he would bring in such impertinent stuffe, for the foreshew of his wares: for first it was neuer hard of before (I think) that D. Harding after his departure out of England to Louayne in the beginning of her maiesties raigne,VVhether D. Harding returned into England. came home to liue in England agayne, or to exercise Episcopal iurisdiction therin, but rather about the tyme this man assigneth; he was busy wryting in Flanders against his aduersary M. Iewel. Secondlie what need was there to geue him Episcopal Iurisdiction in England at that tyme, who abyding as I haue said in Flanders, there were diuers Bishops yet liuing in England, and other learned men to haue exercised that Episcopal iurisdiction, if need had byn. But this is more ridiculous which ensueth, that he had a Bul to dispence vvith irregularities, and to receaue all that vvould be reconciled to the Pope, for what needed either Bul or Episcopal iurisdiction for this, seing euery ordinarie Priest may haue authoritie to do it, without Bul or Episcopal iurisdiction, or what special need was there at that

tyme to dispence with irregularityes or to reconcile men more then before? Doth O.E. know what irregularitie meaneth? or wil he tell his reader trewly, what is vnderstood by reconcilling to Catholike religion, which he calleth to the Pope? no, I trow not, it is not their fashion to deale sincerely in any poynt, for proof wherof heare his exposition, All that vvere reconciled (sayth he) to the Pope, renounced their obedience to the Prince,
               Spiritual obedience may stand vvith temporal. and is it so in deed Sir minister? wo then to the Emperor, & to the kings of Spayne, France, Polonia, and Princes of Italy and other places, whose subiects are eyther all, or the most parte reconciled to the Pope in the sense that we talk of Catholyke religion, and yet haue they not I trow renounced therby all obedience to their temporal princes: So that reconciliation to the Pope may stand with due obedience to their naturel princes also, if O.E. & his seditious mates wil be content to vnderstand matters a right, and not to cauil wilfully against their owne consciences.
            As for D. Mortons sending into the north by  
               Pius Quintus for declaration of his sentence geuen in Rome (which is the next poynt that followeth in this ministers tale) it being so long agoe, and but a particuler English mannes act, cannot by any reason preiudice any more the residue of Catholykes now in England,The Earle of Effex his attempt. then the late attempt of the Earle of Essex did or may do all English puritanes, and protestāts, that were of his religion, or shalbe hereafter, though not priuie to his attempt, nor any thing so much, as the said late attempt may touch perhaps this hungry minister, if matters were wel examined, who being of his retinue, and of more need then his maister; is likly inough to haue byn of his councel, and partaker of his golden purposes.
            As for that which foloweth of recusant Catholikes, 
               that they do enioy their lands, goods, country, and libertie,

notvvithstanding they are secretlie reconciled to the Pope and do adhere to her Maiesties enemyes (as by a marginal note he sayth) doth appeare by diuers letters of priests ready to be shevved
               ▪
               Catholykes enioying their goodes, and libertie. for there enioying, I would the ministers ioy were not greater in his benefices, and then I doubt not, but he would be more calme then now he is, & his hawty wyues hayre would soone grow through her french veluet hood, but for their adhering to enemyes, testified (as he sayth) by Priests letters, we haue as litle reason to beleeue him against Priests (not shewing their letters) as they should haue to write any such vntruth, which we beleeue not, but take it as a stratageme deuised, to set vs at diuision among our selues.
            
                The whole discourse next ensuing is so bitter, & spiteful & so ful of gore blood, & poyson as it needeth his visour of O. E. to vtter thesame, for that the cunning compagnion, though he be content to fawne, and flatter & be knowne vnderhand, therby to gather vp some morsels for the present, yet fearing perhaps somwhat the future, and considering that both tymes, and matters and men may change, he thought good to p

               euent afterclaps by couering his true name, and to purchase securitie for tyme to come with the losse, or diminishment of some prayse present, And therfore walking out of sight in this behalf he playeth egregiouslie the syrebrand, telling her Maiestie and her counsel,O.E.A. notorious fyrebrand of sedition. 
               that too much extraordinarie fauour, and remissnes tovvards Catholikes hath caused diuers rebellions, both in England, and Ireland, and that it hath dissolued the very synevves of gouernment, & that it is more profitable, and expedient to excute lavves then to pardon offenders, &c. All which this sycophāt chaunted out lustely, at that very tyme and season to fil vp her Maiesties eares, when his Lord and yong king Essex was most busy in plotting her Maiesties ouerthrow vnder pretence of meeting at puritane sermons; and seing that this plot was layd in Ireland

(from whence this minister vnder pretence of running away for feare of punishment of some vntemperate words spoken, came into England not long before his maister, as heere is reported) it may be he came about this negotiation, and fearing least it might be discouered before due tyme, he took in hand to write this book of all-arme against Catholikes to disguyse and shadow the other,A treacherous deuise. and to diuert mens eyes another way: but for this let her Maiesties wyse counsel looke vnto, and prouide as they shal fynd need, I am only to proceed in refuting of his malice, and folly, let them punish his treacherie and knauery if they fynd it.

            All this then is against himselfe as most cleerly might be shewed by exposition of all antiquity if  we had tyme to stand theron. But aboue all the rest most notoriouslie against himselfe, is his discourse that followeth, wherin truly I cannot but wonder both at his folly and impudēcy in setting it downe; his wordes are these (and I pray the gentle reader note the whole matter) to the effect before mentyoned

Augustine him selfe, and do shew the place by him to be egregiously falsifyed, and heere it is contradicted also by his champion O. E. who sayth that S. Augustine highly commended the Emperors iustice, and albeit he say only that it vvas necessarie that heretical preachers should be repressed, and corrected, yet that the said Emperors iustice passed further appeareth clearely by the decree of Theodosius and Valentinian, whose wordes are: Manichaeis etiam ex ciuitate pellendis,

                And thus much for a note of contradictiō amōg themselues to wit the knight and his champion, & now to the matter by O. E. heere treated, which cōteyneth; principal poynts, at yow see, that would requyre a long treatise if I should handle them all at large. The first is out of S. Paul, the second out of

the Emperors decrees, the third out of S. Augustine; all against himself. I shal say a word or two of each one in order and therby vow shal discerne the mans iudgment.S. Paul alleaged by O. E. against himself. The place of S. Paul is directly against sectaries that make diuision among them that were in peace and vnity of religion before, and do bring in new doctryne different from that which they had learned and receaued publiquely before, which maketh the case of our controuersie very cleare: For whether Martyn Luther, Vldericus Zuinglius, Iohn Caluyn, and the rest of that crue, haue done this or no in our age, and whether the protestants in England fynding Catholiques in peace, and vnity, haue done like offices in bringing in new opinions and dissention which was not before, let all the world iudge. Sure I am they cannot say, that we fynding them in vnity did trouble their peace, or go out from them, so as this place of S. Paul is wholy against themselues, and this to the first poynt.
            The second for vs, and against them is, of the  Emperors decrees against heretikes cyted by this minister; And it is strange that euer he world bring them in, but that of all other protestants that euer wrote this fellow seemeth the most impudent (it may be for that he goeth masked,Emperors decrees alleaged against himself and his by O.E. he blusheth not to affirme that which all his fellowes haue denyed vntil this day, as after yow shal see in a number of poynts) and heere now I would aske him, why he brought in these Emperors decrees of punishing heretikes? what heretikes they were? how they were defyned? by what they were distinguished frō Catholiques? why and for what causes they were punished?
            The decree beginneth thus: Arriani, Macedoniani, &c. Arrians,Leg. Arriani Cod. de haereticia. Macedonians, Apollinarians, Nouatians, Sabatians, Valentinians, Montanists, Donatists, and the like, named in this place to the number

of 34. are commanded to be punished for heretikes by these catholike Emperors Theodosian and Valentinian in the yeare of Christ 428.
            
                And in the very next decree after they say thus:

                  Damnato portentosae superstitionis authore Nestorio.
                  Cod. lib. 1. 
                        ••

                        ••••
                     . 
                  &c. seing that Nestorius (the Author of a most monstrous superstition for saying that the blessed Virgin was not mother of God, but of man only) is now condemned (by the late Councel of Ephesus) we wil that his followers haue the note of a fit name du
                     •
                   vnto them; to wit, that they be called not Christians, but Nestorians of Nestorius, as the followers of Arrius were called by the law of Cōstantyne (our predecessor of happy memory) Arrians, and the followers of the sect and heresy of Porphirius porphirians, &c.
            
            
                This was their sentence for naming heretikes after their Authors,Names of Lutheranes Caluinists, &c. and do yow not thinke that if Luther, Zwinglius, and Caluyn had byn in their dayes also, and had raysed such a company af Sectaryes after them, as they did, would they not haue called them as we do; Lutherans, Zuinglians & Caluinists? yes truly; for that by any other name they could not be vnderstood.
            But heare yet a further distinction geuen by the same Emperors betweene heretikes & Catholikes: 
                  Q

                     ie haereticos, &c. let them know that they are heretikes.
            
            
                This decree made Valentinian and Martian Emperors

of the east and west, nyne and twenty yeares after the former decree. And the like made the Emperor Maximilian after the late Councel of Trent against all kynd of Protestants, Lutherās, Zuingliās, Anabaptists, Caluinists, and the like condemned by the said Councel, so as the same reason that moued Valentinian and Marcian almost 1200. yeares agoe to proclame them heretiques that were condemned by the Councel of Calcedon in their dayes, wherin Leo primus B. of Rome had the chiefe hand, and confirmed the same. The same I say moued Maximilian the Emperor of our dayes to proclame for heretiques all protestants condemned in the Councel of Trent, gathered in his tyme by like authoritie, as that of Calcedon was: but yet let vs see one deduction furder.
            Of what religion (think yow) were these Emperors  that made these lawes against those heretikes? or what communion were they of? for by this we shal see who they were whom they condemned. Did these Emperors then agree with the Church and religion of Rome, and acknowledged that for the cheefe and head church of Christianity, and the Bishops therof to be head Pastors? For if they did, then condemned they such, as did not the same then, or do not thesame now. This poynt then let vs explayne (good reader) and therby also learne the sutle shifting of this shuffling Minister.
            Truly the first decree of al Iustinians Code  (which is a collection of all Christian Emperors decrees) being of Gratian,The religion of Gratian, Valentinian & Theodosius. Valentinian, and Theodosius, whose first words are. 
                  Cunctos populos, &c.
Doth appoynt and command all Christian people both of the Roman and Greeke Empyre to follow the fayth and religion of the Roman Church deliuered to them by S. Peter, and continued vnto that day, which (say they) Damasus the Bishop of that Citty

doth follow, as also Peter Bishop of Alexandria, & whosoeuer did not follow this vnity of Religion should be counted infamous heretikes:
This is the substance of that first decree, which being so, tel me now, if this doth touch our protestants or no? who can abyde neyther Roman B. nor Roman Religion.
            
                Thesame three Emperors in an other Decree do describe vnto vs, what manner of heretikes they would haue punished,Leg. omnes de haerer. lib.

                  es? Those are heere called heretiques, and to be punished by our lawes made against them, whosoeuer shal be detected to dissent and disagree, euen in any smal matter, from the iudgment and path of Catholike religion. Thus say they. And seing in their first Decree they do declare that the Roman religion vnder Pope Damasus was the only Catholike religion to be folowed, it is easely seene whether Protestants or Papists at this day be comprehended vnder these penal lawes made against heretikes, or no?
            
                And finally that we may see by one Emperors playne decree, what religion they were of, and of what society and communion, and whom they accompted true Catholikes, and whom heretikes, yow must know that in the fore-said Code of Iustinian there is a letter of Iohn the first B. of Rome, written to the said Emperor Iustinian whose tytle is this; Gloriosissimo & clement

                  ssimo filio Iustiniano Ioannes Episcopus vrbis Romae, &c. wherein among other prayses which the Pope geueth him, one principal was, that notwithstanding he was Emperour of Constantinople, and that some emulation now began in that Empyre against the Citty of Rome, yet he persisted in his Catholike due obedience to the said Church of Rome head of all other Churches;

               Yow being moued by the loue of faith, & studie of charitie & wel instructed in the discipline of the Church, do continue your reuerence to the Roman sea, and do subiect all other therunto, bringing them to the vnity of this Churche, to whose foūder, the first of all the Apostles Christ gaue this precept feed my sheepe which Churche as wel the rules,10.21. and traditions of ancient Fathers as the decrees of former Christian Princes haue declared to be truly the head of all other Churches, And the same do testifie your Maiesties most reuerent speeches and behauiour towards the same.
            
            This wrote the Pope to him, which letter he  putting into his said Code or book of Statutes, as a most honorable monument, answered the same, and made a decree theron, which beginneth thus: Victor Iustinus pius faelix Imperator, &c. Ioanni Smo. Archiepiscopo Alme Vrbis Romae,
               Cod. ibid. leg. nos reddentes lib. 1. tit. 3.

               We rendering due honor to the sea Apostolike, and to your Holinesse (which alwayes we haue desyred as becometh to a Father) we haue endeauored, in honour of your beatitude to bring to the knowledge of your Holines all things that do appertayne to the state of all Churches for that it hath byn alwayes our study to keepe and conserue the vnity of your Apostolike sea, and of the holy Churches of God, which vnity hath alwayes hitherto perseuered immouable without any contrariety, and consequentlie we haue byn careful to subiect and vnite all priests of the

whole east coūtryes, to the sea of your Holines.
            
            
                Thus beginneth he his decree which is ouer lōg to be here all inserted, but any man may read it, wherin the Emperor with great humility and affection professeth his due subiection and of al his Empyre to the Church of Rome, naming her in expresse wordes, Caput omnium Ecclesiarum, head of all other Churches, and that whatsoeuer doctryne is different from the doctryne of this Church is heretical; by which rule he condemneth for heretikes in this, and in two other that follow immediatly, and are extant in the Code both in Greeke and Latyn, Nestorius,

                The third poynt also touching S. Augustine his approuing,S. Augustin alleaged by O. E. against himself. and commending much these Emperors for punishing heresyes, & for making lawes against heretikes is altogither for vs in like manner, and fully against protestants,

                     . ad Vincent.
                for that S. Augustine dealing specially in this pointe against the Donatists & Circumcellians who denyed the visible Church dispersed ouer the whole world, and restrayned it to their sect only in Africa (as euery sect of our Protestants doth at this day to the particuler place, and Society where they liue) it is easely seene who were heretikes, and who to be punished by S. Augustines opinion, to wit those that do rise vp against the vniuersal knowne, and visible Church of their tyme, & do condemne it, or are condemned by it, and let Sir minister bring but one example to the contrarie in any age from Christ to Luther, and it shal be sufficient, to wit, that any man condemned by the general knowne, and visible Church of his tyme for an heretike, was not held and taken for such by any

of that tyme or any tyme after that was not an heretike himselfe, let Oules eie I say spie but one exāple of this, out of all antiquitie and it shal be sufficiēt.
            Wherfore to end all his matter about Imperial  lawes for punishing of heretikes, and approuing therof both by the Apostle, and by S. Augustine (which yet other Protestants hitherto did neuer vrge, as this witles minister doth) let the reader marke this firme deduction, and playne demonstration, all those foresaid Christian and Catholike Emperors so much comended by S. Augustine, and other Fathers following after him, to wit, Gratian, Valentinian, Theodosius, Marcian, Arcadius, Honorius, Iustinian and others,A manifest deduction & demonstration against nevv sectaties. that made lawes against heretikes, they held the Roman religion in their dayes to be the Catholike, and true Christian religion, though diuers of them were of the Greeke Church and Empyre. They professed the Bishops of Rome to be the heads and cheife leaders of this vniuersal and visible Catholike Church, as before hath byn shewed by the example of Gratian, Valētiniā, Theodosius to Pope Damasus & of Arcadius Honorius, Theodosius the second, & S. Augustine, Pope Innocentius primus, and of Iustinian to Pope Iohn the first, and consequētlie they pronounced for heretikes all those that did rise vp apart, vnder particuler Authors differing in opinions from this vniuersal church, as Arrians, Donatists, Montanists, and the like. This vniuersal visible and external Church hath endured euer since vnder Popes and Emperors, and other gouernors of Christianitie vntil the tyme of Pope Leo the tenth and his successors, and of Emperors, Ferdinand, Charles the fifth, Maximilian and their followers when Luther began to brake out from that Church, and against that Church, and others following his example since that tyme.
            
               
                Now then I would aske by what equity or reason this later brood comming forth of this Church, and rebelling against it can cal those men heretikes that remayned in the fayth of the foresaid Church, and moreouer wil say, that they must be punished by the same lawes, that the foresaid Catholike Emperors made against those, that impugned that Churche. This I say, I would haue our new Oedipus to answere, and in the meane space, the discrete reader may consider how it can be answered by him, & so blush for him that hath not byn ashamed to bring in so cleare a conuiction against himselfe.
            
                One onely sillie shift, or pettie cauil this minister perhaps may run vnto, as dyuers of his fellowes are wont with a brasen affirming, that the visible Catholike, and Roman Church when Luther began, was not the same, that it was when those Emperors made those lawes; but thē I would aske him, when it changed, and how, and by what meanes so great a body so generally planted, so strengthened, and fortifyed not only by Gods spirite, but also by learned men, Doctors, Councels in euery age, could come to be changed and perish without testimony of any one wryter, or historiographer without noyse, cōtention, or contradiction of any?
            
                The Emperors are knowne that liued, and raigned in this meane space, and except two or 3. (as Leo the third called Isaurus and his sonne Constantine the fifth surnamed Capronius) which fel into heresyes, and were noted, and condemned by the same Churche) all the rest liued and dyed in one Religion of their ancestors. The Popes also from Ioannes primus before mentyoned to whom Iustinian the Emperor wrote his decree, vnto Leo decimus, whē Luther begāne are in nūber about 17c. all of one religion, nor can it be shewed that any one

Pope impugned his predecessor in matters of fayth.
            This demonstration is as cleare then as that 3. and 4. do make 7. for when Luther and Lutherans began their new sects,A most

                  stration. our Churche was held for the only Catholike, and true Churche of christendome, and so did both Luther, Zuinglius and Caluin hold it also before they fel, when the one was a Fryer, the other two Priests, and all three said Masse how then by their falling from it, the said church should be made no church, and their new congregations to be the only true Cathol. Church, and that they should come now to-call themselues Catholikes, and vs heretikes, and that we should be punished for heretikes by the former Imperial lawes made against themselues, and their lyke, this I say, is a mysterie, and metamorphosis that passeth the reach of all sober men, and none but mad heads can eyther say it, or beleeue it, for that by the same argument may English Puritanes at this day (which is a yonger brood of protestāts as yow know in our country) taking some port, or towne in England, & fortifying themselues therin, cal Parlament Protestants to account saying (as they do) that they are the elder church, and that they wil punish parlament Protestants with the same Parlament lawes which Protestants made of purpose to punish them. But I am ouerlong in a matter so cleare, and therfore I craue pardon of thee (good reader) and wil here end, and so much the rather for that I am to handle this poynt more at large afterward against O. E. in his new chalenge, to wit, who be heretikes, and who be not, for that he wil needs take vpon him to defend this mad, & desperate paradox, that papists be heretikes, & protestants Catholikes, but I think we shal shake him out of his clouts when he cometh to that combat & somwhat yow may ghesse by that which here hath byn said.
            
               
                VVherfore to draw to an end of this his preface, & to draw our doughtie Minister out of the dyke of imperrinent discourses, after a litle ruffle of choler wherin he saith that the proud and presumptuous Iesuite calling himselfe N. D. had presented his vvard-vvord to her Maties.

I haue (sayth he) to meet him at euery turne vvith my ansvvere to this noddy conioyned a briefe discourse, and in certayne nevv Encounters dravving him into a nevv combat, proued, that Popish religion is neyther Catholique nor ancient, nor true religion, nor the true Church of Christ, nor the Popes agents that haue byn executed for traytors; true martyrs, &c.
            
            Thus he vaunteth what he would do as Goliath  did,1. Reg. 17. 
               Dabo carnes tuas volatilibus coeli, &c. but what he wil performe when he cometh into the feild, where he and I must try who is the Noddy; that we shal see after. And I am content the reader be both looker on and Iudge, yf the sturdie minister receyue more blowes then he expected, and returne home beaten back and syde in this first combat about the Ward-word, then may his frends bemone him if they list while other do laugh and then shal we haue litle need to enter into his new combat which he offreth after this, but if he proue himselfe a man in the first then may he more be trusted in the second.
            
                As for my presumptiō in presenting my defence, and ward vnto the Lords of her Maties. Counsel,No presumption to haue offred the VVards-vvord to the Lords of the Counsel. I see no reason, besyds this Ministers anger and disdayne, why it should be so called or taken, seing their honours are publique iudges & vmpyres by office, for all sorts of persons to haue refuge vnto. And for so much as the iniuryes offered by the Watch-word as a famous libel, as wel to great forrayne Princes and nations, as to honorable, worshipful and most

honest subiects, did touch the honour and publique weale of our kingdome and nation very neare, to whom should I haue gone for remedy in this matter but only to their Lordships? should I haue made my mone to the Puritanical and tyrannical Presbytery of Sr F

                Ministers, or to the rude rable of O. E. his pyratical compagnions? we haue seene the issue of both these sorts of late, and therby may we gather what equity we should fynd at their hands, seing the Prince whom they most flattered, hath found at their hands so egregious treachery and conspiracy.
            To their Honours I appealed then with iust reason, & shal do now agayne in the end of this my  book, to cal these two defendants to account of the crymes of flattery forgery, & sycophācy, vsed by thē in this their writing, to the end that if my seueral warnings which I am to geue them after all the Encounters do not worke some good in them, yet at least wyse their honours authority, and respect may make them blush and put them to silence.
            Last of all the Ministers conclusion is this, not  vnlike to the premisses. This (sayth he) I may boldly say that I haue not follovved the aduersaryes vayne in scurrilous scoffing, nor his vanity in ruffinlike bragging. Boldly yow may say it S.

To the first if it be weaknes of brayne and wit, it is pardonable, for that it is forcible, but if it be weaknes of manners and honestly it is a fowle fault in a prelate and preaching deane that should strengthen others.

               A BRIEFE SVMMARIE of all, that before hath byn said, or now is to be added about this first Encounter of Blessinges and cursinges by change of Catholike Religion. CHAP. 1.
               
                  TOVCHING the seueral argumentes  of the Watch-word and Ward-word in general, as also of this secōd reioyneder & combat betwene Sir Francis and me, in this his VVast-word and my Warn-word, as in like maner the late

arriual of O. E. his, Wrangle-word sufficient hath byn said before in the preface to the whole worke, as also in the epistle to O. E. himselfe, and in the annotations vpon both their letters to the Reader, so as now we are only to treat of the proper subiect of this first Encounter, which is this, that Sir. F. H. being entred into a serious contemplation in the height of his careful watch ouer England and thinking to imitate perhaps herin the spirit of some hidden prophet (whome he desired to resemble) estemed it not only expedient, but incident also to the vigilancy of the office of a general watchman, taken vpon him by his owne election, & not by any mans cōmission to forwarne the people not only of great and mighty fayned daungers hanging ouer them, from Catholikes, but also of innumerable new deuised blessings, benefits and benedictions abounding among them, and flowing to them daylie by the fortunate chaunge of ould religion into Protestancy,The subiect of S F. book. breaking forth into these words of fervour:Pap. 2. 
                  Yf I should take vpon me to enter into the enumeration of all the bene

                     its and blessings that from the Almightie haue byn powred vpon this litle Isle of England, &c. And herevpon cōcludeth that seing they had gotten so greatly already by the bargaine, they should be merry and go forward, and neuer thinke of returne, &c. and this was the beginning of his watchword.
               
                   To which the Warder, thinking it expedient to oppose himselfe,VVard vvord taketh vp S. F. for a

false and flattering Prophet by these wordes of Esay:Esay. 3. 
                  my people they that say thou art blessed, are those that deceiue thee
                  ▪ shewing further the great inconueniences, hurts, daungers, damages, and pernitious effects of such flattering tongues in common wealthes, & that himselfe doth contradict himselfe in this very poynt soone after; talking nothing els but of feares, frights, and terrours by daungers and miseries imminent to our countrey,A brag of blessings examined. without specifying or setting downe to the cōtrary any one particular blessing at all comen hitherto to the realme, or like to come by their new gospel, but only feeding them with those general fayre words of fleering adulation, which the warder holding for fond and contemptible in so manifest, and important a matter, reiecteth them without further answere.
               And then passing on to the poynt it selfe  more in particuler he reduceth all benefits and blessings that haue happened to England, or can happē, vnto two general heads or branches that is spiritual touching religion: and temporal concerning the common wealth, and in both these kinds, he sheweth by many weightie arguments, that not blessings, but cursings, not benefits but calamityes, haue & are lyke to fal vpon our coūtry, by this fatal & vnfortunate change of Religion, giuing manifest examples in both sortes, and concludeth with a brief repetition of all, and this is the summe of the warders answere to this first Encounter of imagined blessings.
               
                  
                   But vpon this poynt replyeth now agayne the K. in this his Apology or defence,A vayne reply by the Knight. which vpon iust causes (as yow shal see) I haue termed a VVast-word, and first of all he maketh a solemne florish by detesting all flattery and alleageth diuers sentences of sundry Poëts and Philosophers in despraise of flattery, and then addeth, that there is farre greater flattery in Rome to the Pope, then he vseth in this place, and further that there was no contradiction betwixt his words of present daungers now imminent to England, and of former blessings by their ghospel receyued, so as though England be not blessed at the present, yet hath it byn heretofore, and then letting passe all that euer, the warder hath said, in the examination of the foresaid two heads of spiritual & tēporal blessings, he bringeth in ten new benedictions freshly framed out of the forge of his owne imagination, to the supply of his former want; assuring vs that they are proper fruits of his new ghospel & ghospellers:Ten nevv fresh blessings. And that they haue ensued by the former change of religion: which blessings, & benedictions he auoweth to be vnity of doctrine, Liberty of reading Scriptures in vulgar languages, Publique prayer in English exercise of good works more then be

                   This is the summe of his Apologie to this

                   now (who before was only a warder as yow haue heard) and besyds his wards, warneth also the watchmā of his wants in this his VVast-word, shewing first, that all his defence is but verbal and impertinent speach, and consequently iustly termed by him a VVast-word: for that to flatter, and detest I flattery at one tyme, is no defence, or iust excuse, of flattery but rather folly, and impudency ioyned to flattery, and that it litle easeth him or helpeth his cause, if there should be so great flattery in Rome as he sayth, seing that this iustifieth not▪ nor authorizeth any flattery vsed by him in England, that it is vayne and ridiculous to vaunt of blessings past, and not present, seing the present and future is that which importeth most, and not that which is past, and more ridiculous, for that if they were true blessings which are past, they were brought in and lefte by the old Catholique religion, and if they be not now present, it is for that the new religion hath lost them: that the ten new felicityes now freshly deuised, and brought in by the K. are neyther true in themselues nor in the nature of blessing, but rather quite contrarie, and others nothing pertinent to the purpose, and diuers of them of no consideration at all, but rather fond and contemptible mockeryes.
               And finally that Sr. F. his running out of the  feild,The Knight flyeth the true cōbate. and flying from all the wayes of tryal offred by the warder both about Spiritual, and temporal blessings, and cursings, is a playne

argument, that he dareth not ioyne really and substantially in the combat, but only to florish for fashion sake, and to make a shew of skyrmishing in the ayer for holding vp his credit with the bare name of a new Apologie, keeping himselfe warily notwithstāding within his owne listes only, and farre of from the true Encounter, and running now and then, when he is sore pressed, behind the cloath of state, that is to say protecting himselfe with the name, & authority of her Matie. and of the present gouernment, where all other arguments fayle him for his defence; and this in general is the summe of all this Encounter with the K. Now must we come to examine what his Minister champion or martial procter O. E. hath brought in his supply; coming foorth after the other.

And so to the first point about flattering the state with fayned blessings and benedictions, the minister going quite from the matter, falleth to flatter her Matie. a fresh, and that most grossely in the very first lynes of this Encounter, as though the controuersy betweene him and vs were about her Maties.

                   WHeras the warder layd palpable flatterie to Sir F. charge about his ydle vaunt of innumerable blessings, and benedictions ensued to England by change of old religion, he answereth thervnto now with this preface or proeme.VVast-vvord Pag. 3.

as most contrarie thervnto) I haue thought it not a misse to shape a short answere vnto it, in suspicion of heresie; Hierome (as Bishop Iewel alleadgeth him) would haue no man pacient, & though I wil not burst out into any impaciēce (as considering more what is fit for me to speake then for him to heare) yet I hold that in the greiuous accusation of flatterie, I ought not to be silent.
               
               Marke reader the poyntes; he wil shape an  answere, but how he shapeth it, yow shal after see, he wil not breake into any impacience, this promise how wel it is obserued his future scolding, and contumelious words wil declare, and I shal endeuour to put yow in mynd therof, now and then when I passe by it. Hierome said (as Bishop Iewel alleadgeth) that in suspition of heresie no man must be pacient. Iewel is aleadged heere with more honour then Hierome, Iewel is named Bishop which he neuer was, and Hierome is not called Saint, which he was; and is, no place in eyther of them is cyted where the words may be read; Hierome speaketh of heresy not of flatterie, S.F. would excuse himselfe of flatterie, not of heresy for in heresy he delighteth; and how then do these things agree, and if for further proofe I should aske him whether he or M. Iewel wil stand to S. Hieromes definition of heresy and hereticks euen in those very books where he hath this sentence of impaciēce against heresie, to wit in those he wrote against Iouianus and Vigilantius, whom he condemneth, and calleth heretiks for the very

same opinions that Sir F. & M. Iewel do hold for ghospelyke good doctrine,Heretikes out vvith S. Hierome. I meane about Virginitie, prayer to Saynts, lights at Martyrs

Wherfore this first dedefence is no defence, but impertinent wasting of words as yow see, let vs behold his second

which perhaps may proue worse or more impertinent then this.
               His second defence is that greater flatterie  may be found in Rome to the Pope then he vseth to the Queene and state of England, I would send yow (sayth he) to the Popes pallace where a man may fynd more shameles flatterers then I thinke were euer to be found in any Christian Princes Court.

                   But now to the matter it self, I say that after muche seeking in Panormitan,Panorm. part. 1. decret. de Elect. c. Licet. I haue found at length the place, and therein the woords by him and his alleaged, but with this difference, that Panormitan cyteth the sentence not as his owne; but out of Hostiensis, and sheweth the meaning to be that in matters of iurisdiction and spiritual authoritie for gouernmēt of his Churche vpon earth Christ hath lefte so great power vnto his substitute S. Peters successor, as he may do thereby and in his name and vertue in a certayne sorte, what-so-euer his Mayster and Lord might do in his Church, if he were now conuersant among vs vpon earth, I say in a certaine sort, for that all both Deuines and Canonists do agree that potestas excellentiae wherby our Sauiour could institute Sacraments, pardon synnes and impart the other effects of thesayd Sacraments without their vse and the like, is not lefte vnto the Pope as not necessarie to the gouernment of his Churche, but all the

rest requisit to that end is gyuen to him according to that great commission in S. Mathew.Matth. 16. 
                  I wil giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, whatsoeuer thow loosest shalbe loosed and what soeuer thow byndest shal be bound, &c. vpon which commission Panormitan saith, that Hostiensis founded his doctrine in these wordes:Host. in c.

Seing that the Consistorie or Tribunal of Christ and the Pope is one and the same in this world (as appeareth by the former commission) it followeth that the Pope can do (in spiritual iurisdiction) whatsoeuer Christ can doe, except lyuing free from synne.
               This is the doctrine of Hostiensis expounded  by Panormitan,Panormitan and Hostiē

                     is both abused. and if it be rightly vnderstood it hath no more absurditie in it, then if a man should say, that the Viceroy of Naples can do all in that Kingdome which the king of Spaine himself can doe except being free from treason. And the like of her Maiesties deputy in Ireland or any other substitute, that hath the Superiors authority fully and amply.
               And albeit heretikes doe wrangle herein  and seek to make the matter odious (as they are wont) by putting downe the bare propositiō of comparing the Pope with God without any explication at all,VVrangling and cauelling of haeretikes. yet are there so many restrictions mencioned euen in this place of Hostiensis (yf they would consyder them, as easely might answere all their cauillations.

For first where they compare the Pope with God both Panormitan and Hostiensis explicat the comparison of Christ not as he is God, but as he is man, that is to say, betwene the head of the Churche and his Substitute. Secondly the comparison is not in all things (as in miracles, holynes of lyfe, nor power of excellency as haue byn sayd or the like) but onely in the highest iurisdiction of Ecclesiastical matters deryued from Christ himself, and gyuen by him, as appeareth by the word consistorium vsed by Panormitan. Thirdly euen in this also is added quasi, which is a diminution in the excellency and generality of the thing it self. Fourthly is put Excepto peccato, which exception though Panormitan do affirme to be improper in Host

                  ensis maner of speaking, for that to be able to synne is no power, but rather a defect of power: Yet is it added here to signifie, that the Pope maye synne or erre in matter of fact, euen in the exercise of this power that he hath vnder Christ. Yf he vse it not wel, for which respect is added also the last restriction of all euen in that very place by Panormitan, where he saith: Intellige tamen quod Papa omnia potest claue dis

                     ope. so long as the key of discretiō doth not erre; which is asmuch as if he had sayd that the Pope is bound in conscience to vse discretion consultation, inquisition, due deliberation and other fyt meanes to informe

himself in matters that he wil do or determyne, which in points of faith we are most certayne that Gods holy Spirit promysed to his Churche wil euer direct him vnto; and neuer suffer him to erre.
               And so much of this scornful obiection  guilfully cast out by heretiks to deceaue the symple and to terrify them by comparing God and the Pope without any exposition or explication as yow haue heard; which fraud I passe ouer with diuers other such ridiculous speeches auouched out of other Canonistes in this place, without cyting booke, volume, place or chapter, and not woorth the answering, and therfore I wil only mentyon our knights conclusion which is this.
               
                  And in a woord (saith he) the Canonists say
                   
                  roundly in the glosse, Dominus noster Deus Papa, our Lord God the Pope. If the Canonists so roundly affirme it,Syr F. taken in cyting Canonists. why hath not Sir F. eyther roundly or squarely quoted vs the text? Sure it is that I can not fynd it though muche I haue sought, and hard yt is to beleeue that any suche text may be fownd, which is muche confirmed by that S. F. Proctor comming after him to fil vp the gappes that he had left open, and strayning himself muche about this point could not find any one text of Canonist or other that had those wordes, and therfore was forced to Father them vpō 
                  Aug. Steuchus with a notorious falsification, as in the chapter following shal be shewed. But yet

heere to help out S.F. with some parte of his credit,A deuise to helpe out Syr F. & for very compassion I wil ad a coniecture of a frend of his, how he might chance to haue byn deceaued about Dominus Deus noster Papa, if he cite it vpon his owne reading, for that perchance he might fynd it written thus; D. noster D. Papa. both D.D. signifying a double Dominus, which some cauilling heretike espying, & iudging it inconuenient to repeat Dominus twyse, would needs inforce the second D. to be set for Deus; This is my coniecture confirmed somwhat by the similitude of a like fond chance wherof I haue heard as happened in the subscription of an English letter written from certayne Maryners to the Lord Admiral in these words: To the right honorable our good L. the L. Admiral which secōd L. a simple fellow interpreted to signifie the lady Admiral saying, that the first L. signifying the Lord himselfe, the second L. must needs signifie also his lady. If I misse in this coniecture or comparison S. F. is cause therof that cyted not the text, therby to cleare all matters, and to deliuer both vs of this doubt, and himselfe of new suspition of imposture.
               
                   And albeit this were a sufficient answere to so foolish obiections without testimony, or authority, yet for that our K. wil needs seeme so learned a bible clarke, as to terrifie the people with the name of God imparted to creatures,Hovv a creature may be called God. I wil aske him and his ministers in this place the meaning of a text or two out of scripture it selfe,Exod. 7. v. 1. as first those wordes of God in

                  Exodus, dixit
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Dominus ad Moysen, ecce constitui te Deum Pharaonis: and God sayd vnto Moyses, behold I haue made thee the God of Pharao did God giue away his deity with this thinke yow? And againe I would aske him the interpretation of those wordes of Christ, whē he sayth, Nonne scriptum in lege vestra est, Ego dixi, Dij estis?Io. 10. vers. Psalm. 81. vers. 6. Is it not written in your law, I sayd yow are Gods? And then answereth to the question, himselfe thus: Si illos dixit Deos, ad quos sermo Dei factus est, & nō potest solui scriptura. If God called them Gods to whom the speach of God was directed, and that this scripture cannot be answered or denyed &c. These two questions I haue proposed from S. F. and his Ministers instruction, not for that I do think any wryter to haue byn so simple as to calle the Pope expressely God, though yet we see clearlie by these examples that the word Deus in some sense may be appyed,Hierom. lib. 1. in Mat. also to creatures without iniury of the creator. And S. Hierome waying and pondering the wordes of Christ vnto his disciples 6. mat. Quem dicunt homines esse filium hominis, &c. And then agayne, Vos autem quem me esse dicitis? hath these words: Prudens lector attende, quod ex consequentibus textu
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      sermonis, Apostoli nequaquā homines sed Dij appellantur. Marke prudent reader, that it is euident by the consequence, and illation of Christ his wordes, that the Apostles are not called men heere but Gods. Thus said S. Hierome, who yet knew aswel what Idolatry meaneth as S.F. of whom I would aske, why

he reprehendeth not Cambden, and other protestant wryters, that say to her Ma•ie. 
                  Diua Elizabetha at euery word, but all may passe with these men so it be not to the Pope. And yet one thing yow must note, that whatsoeuer Canonist, or other Catholique do attribute to the Pope it is not in respect of his person, but of his office, and place vnder Christ, so that if they flatter they flatter the office, not the man, but Diua Elizabetha flattereth the person, and so it is flat and grosse flattery. But let vs go forward.
               
                   Yow haue heard then the two first wayes wherby the K. goeth about to excuse himselfe from flattery, wherof the first is but fond, and the second fraudulent, there followeth a third which is both impertinent and ridiculous. For wheras he is accused by the warder to be cō

                   This said I then, what answereth our knight with his Ministers now after so long so large, and so mature deliberation of two yeares? Yow shal haue it briefelie deliuered.

But first we must see what Minister O. E. bringeth after the K. whose book came to my hand when this was writtē, and I haue promised to geue him a place also in the enterlude when his turne cometh, and when he bringeth any thing different from the former or worthy the mentioning.
            
            
               
               PROCTOR O. E. IS called vp the stage to tel his tale & to help out Sr. F. in this matter of flattering the state, and how he playeth his parte farre worse & more ridiculously then the knight himself. CAP. III.
               I Haue promised the (gentle Reader) to exhibite  a short view of the principal pointes which Proctor O. E. bringeth after Sr. F. (if any may be called principal of so paltrie wares) in his late VVrangle-word freshlie come out of England which bringeth such trash so stuffed with impotent and impudent rayling as maketh Sr. F. seeme many tymes a graue & moderate writer, though often also he wil not yeild to the other, we shal compare both & so yow may iudge. First this O.E. setteth downe my beginning of the Ward-word thus;VVrangle-vvord. Pag. 9. Diuers impudencies of O. E. 
                  He beginneth with a longe tale of flattery (saith he) & of the harmes ensuing therof, and at his first setting out entereth into a common place as it were into a common Inne pleasing and resting himselfe, but tyring and harrying his reader with his n

his humor therfore is discouered in vsing so base a similitude of common Innes and common places therto adioyning, wherwith it may be, this minister is more delighted, then euery one of his fellowes, But let vs heare him out further.

                   Let any mā read the first Page of the ward-woord, and then tel me, whether this Minister haue any sorehead at all (though his head be great enough) who saith that I do not so muche as goe about to proue any such matter against S•.F. that he flattered the State, the whole butte of my discourse in that place being nothing els, but to shew that S. F. and his fellowes who preach so many blessings of England by change of Religion (from whence yt hath receu
                     •
                  d indeed so many manifest hurtes and dangers) must needs be famous flatterers. And this Minister an Archparasyte that blusseth not to persuade S. F. that I durst not so muche as goe about to proue flattery against him, when notwithstanding that was my whole argument, as before yow haue heard.
               But wil yow here, an other impudency as gros as this, and thereby learne to know the

man, heere at the very beginning, harkē then what he saith of the Warder, for talking of difficulties rysen and rysing by change of Religion. His aduersaries (saith he) do easely discouer his notorious ympudency,VVrangle-vvord. Pag. 1

                      and his frends do rue his simplicitie, seing him to take as graunted, and boldly to affirme that all men see and acknowlege the difficulties that aryse out of alteration of Religion, when none eyther see it or iustly can affirme any suche matter. Lo gentle Reader, what he saieth and whether it be notorious impudencie in me to say, that some difficulties haue rysen in England and other countryes by alteration of Religion, or in him to hold this for impudencie, and further to affirme, that no man can see or truly affirme any suche matter, of this I say be thow thy self iudge, who perhaps daylie feelest some part of these difficulties by the troubles feared as rysing from this fountaine and origyn.
               But now to go forward in this matter of flattery how doth this minister proceed  therein after the K. yow shal here his method.O. E. a famous flatterer. First he setteth downe a long recital of the personal praises of her Matie. out of Bishop Ozorius a Portugal in his Epistle wrytten to her very neere 30. yeares ago, and out of Petrus Bizarrus an Italian in his storye of Genua and is glad by this occasion to say somewhat, wherof he may hope to receaue a good fee, & withall to make yt seeme that we are enemies of her Maties. praises which is calumnious & parasitical for we do disioyne the harmes ensued by chāge of Religion

and do most willingly acknowlege the personal praises of her Ma•ie seperated frō Religion, wherof the Warder layd not the fault on her, nay rather expresly excepted yt, though this cōpanion in repeating his woords omitteth that parte of purpose and most malitiously, not being desyrous the Warder should shew so dutiful affection and good opinion of her Maties. person, and therby cut of the argument of this cauillers long and ydle babbel fownded vpon this calumniation;The false dealing of O.E. the Warders woords I haue related in the former Chapter and forteenth paragraph. where yow may reade them, and thereby iudge of the true dealing of this false Minister or rather the false dealing of this true Mynister, which I accompt all to be one. But let vs go forward.
               
                   After his discourse of the praises of her Matie. he entreth to shew that Catholikes do maligne and enuy these praises (and yet was Ozorius a Catholike whom he alleageth for the greatest prayser) and so was also so far as we know Bizarrus the other praiser.O.E. Pag 2. And to proue this he runneth about the whole world to seeke witnesses, for besides Sanders Harpsfeld, Ryshton Englishmen, Bozius and Ribadinera, the first an Italian, the second a Spanyard (out of all which notwithstanding he alleageth noe one woord but their bare names) he desyreth also King Salomon to beare him witnes in these woords The wicked doth abhorre those that walke aright,
                  Prouerb. 29. assuring vs

that by the wicked are meant the Catholikes, and by the other parte of the sentence her Matie. and from Salomon he leapeth againe to Clement 7. and Paulus 3. Popes of Rome for their sentences against King Henries mariage with Lady Anne Bollen, and the legitimation of their Children, alleaging woordes which I thinke not fit to be repeated in this place, and so should be haue done also yf his discretion had byn as great as his head,Indiscretion and temeritye of O.E. seing they are now past and forgotten, and were written when her Matie. either was not yet borne, or of that Infancy as she could haue no part in any fault there obiected.
               Yet this prating companion to seeme to  say somewhat in hatred of Catholikes & flatterie of her Matie. wil needs be pratlyng of these affayres, & not content with this goeth further to renew worse sores, and to accuse both K. Henry himselfe, and all the State and Parlament of that tyme with wilful murder and tyranny towards that lady and Queene, saying,Odious matter brought in by this hungry parasite. 1. Pag. 3.

that they haue great vnitie and concord among themselues in matter of doctryne,Vnity among protestantes. which is as very a iest, as if a man should say that sparowes do not chyrpe, nor hennes cackle, nor dawes pratle, nor women chide, or as the foole that said to him that had an extraordinarie great nose, Yow haue no nose (Syr) & this is your priuiledge aboue other men, which is as good and true a priuiledge as this is a blessing of the Protestāts to liue and agree without dissention, which I am forced for decyphering this first obiected blessing to prosecute more largelie then I had meant, though yet I doubt not, it may be both profitable and not vnpleasant to the Reader, to see the progresse therof; but yet first, it is reason that we heare Syr F. who going about to imitate my speach vsed before in the ward-word for expressing the vnitie amongst Catholikes, by the poyntes wherin they agree, he wil needs say the same, and applie it also to Protestants, which I would haue yow to consider, how fitly it agreeth. For thus he sayth.

No truly: but rather encreased dayly, euen vnto their deathes and after also; for out of Luthers doctryne besides these Sacramentaries, there arose in like maner the Anabaptists,Sectaries sprong from Luther, Svvinglius and Caluin. anno 1527. as themselues glory, taking occasion by his Epistle ad VValdenses, where he sayth: That it is better to leaue of baptisme altogeather then to baptise children that haue no fayth: Whervpon they left of baptisme of infants, and went forward in the rest of their heresyes, euen against Luther himselfe at the last.
               
                  After this there sprong vp also out of the  same sect of Luther, the potent diuision of molles and rigidi Lutherani, which endure with open emnity to this day as their bookes do testifie,Rigid and soft Lutherās 
                  VVestphalus, Illiricus, and others of highe Saxony, being the heads of the rigid faction (who resemble our puritans in Englād that would haue nothing but Caluins pure prescription, as these men would Luthers) but on the other side Melanchton and his folowers founders of the softer partie would folow Luther by discretion, taking so much as

And as for Synodes & councels, wheron old fathers rested much for decision of controuersies, these men laugh at them; thoughe yet at last pressed by necessity, and much wearied with continual wrangling about scriptures, diuers sects of our tymes (for all it is impossible to draw togeather) haue byn forced for some shew that they desire agreement, to make among themselues an infinite number of Synodes, meetings parlies and cōuenticles, to wit aboue threescore and ten as Stanislaus Rescius and other writers haue gathered,Rescius li. 1. de Atheis.

               In the towne▪ of Hala in Saxony, in the  yeare of Christ 1527. to wit some nine or tenne yeares after Luther began his doctrine,The first general councel of protestāts in the vvorld 1527. there was made the first general Councel of Lutherans togeather against Sacramentarie Suinglians, where, by a solēne decree (which they called Syngramma) they condemned the doctrine of the said Zwinglius, and his fellowes

                  Carolstadius and Oecolampadius about the Sacrament, as damnable heresy, and pronounced iudicially (Luther being President of the councel) all the followers of that doctrine to be prenicious heretikes; which decree was published presently and printed in the Germaine tongue (with a preface thervnto of Luther himselfe) by Ioannes Agricola one of Luthers cheefe scholers, in the same yeare. But what did these men obay or yeld to this supreme authority of their new Church? noe: but presently Oecolampadius answered Luthers preface, accusing him of much pride & vanity: Oh humility of a new gospeller!

the vnity they haue among them? did Lucifer & his angels euer more furiously fight amōg themselues, then these their folowers do? But heere we must stay our hand and goe no further in forraine fights, but rather get home (as I promised) and see what passeth there, among only Caluinists, and whether they be at any better peace then their brethren are at abroad, and yf not then wil we laughe at Syr F. againe, for his vnity in verity.
            
            
               THE CONTINVATION of thesame narration about vnity in verity, among ridged and soft Caluinistes, named Protestants & puritaines in England and Scotland. CAP. VI.
               
                   HAVING bene ouerlong in this narraration of sorraine disagreement amōgst new gospellers, therby to shew the vanity of Syr F. his vaunt, who said that all their churches in Christendome were of the selfe same iudgment, and blessed vnity; there wanteth not matter to make a farre longer recital of their domestical bickerings, hatred and dissentions, rysen among the Caluinists of England and Scotland, since the raigne of her Maiestie seing there are extant so many bookes of those matters, both betweene Cartwright, Whitgyft, Lupton,

                  se people, or rather their warre and bickerings; being all professors of one and the selfe same sect, to the end we may see what vnity in verity they haue, as our knight braggeth, or rather how their spirit of diuision is no other then that of the Lutherans, Swinglians and other sectaryes, before rehearsed, and as all other heretikes haue euer byn before them, & shalbe after them, for that the selfe same spirit of one and the selfesame find, doth and shal possesse them all to the worldes end.
               First then to beginne with some poynts of  doctrine especially touching princes (of whome heretikes comonly are egregious flatterers yf they fauour their sects, and notorious traytors & paricides, yf they be against them) let vs heare the more ridged part of Caluinists, called Puritans cōcerning her Matie▪
                   authority,Caluinian contention about Princes authority wherwith the knight seeketh continually to presse vs, as though we denied both

spiritual and temporal which is most false in the one; but his men (I meane English Protestants and Puritans) are so deuided among themselues in this poynt, as is incredible, especially to him that heareth the fauning flattery of Sir F. to her Maiestie in his watchword, and knoweth not what his doctors do hould and practise elswhere to the contrary. For harken now to his Ministers assertions in this behalfe.
               
                  
                  Princes (say they) may be deposed (by the people) yf they be Tirants against God and his truth,
                  Knockes in hist. Scot. Pag. 78. & 372. 
                  and their subiects are free from their oathes of obedience. Again the people are better then the king and of greater authority,

                  they haue right to bestow their crowne at their pleasure, they may arraygne their Prince and depose him: To them it appertayneth to make lawes, and to the prince to execute them; they haue thesame power ouer the king, that the king hath ouer any particular person: and it were good, that rewardes were publikely appoynted by the people for such that kil tyrants, as there are for those that kil wolfes and beares.

               And all this and much more is testified also  by a brother of their owne, of the softer sort in a book printed at London by publike authority in the yeare 1593. by Iohn wolfe, the title wherof was, Dangerous positions, &c. with this posy adioyned vnto it out of the epistle of S.

And hauing geuen testimony to this which I haue cyted, & much more, he giueth his censure of others also of the same profession beyond the sea:Lib. 1. Pa. 12. 
                  This new diuinity (sayth he) of dealing thus with Princes is not only held by Knockes and Bucchanan alone (that are Scots) but generally (for ought I can learne) by most of the cheefe consistorians beyond the seas being of the Geneuian humor, as Caluyn, Beza, Hot

               And the same wryter in his second booke, afterward doth shew at large how that M•. Goodman, Mr. Whittingham, and other English Protestants that fled to Geneua in Q. Maries dayes haue left wrytten the same, & farre worse positions against the authority of princes, as in their bookes, and in the foresaid collection

of this author may be read.
               
                   Here then these matters being so, and of so great waight, and the contradiction being open and notorious concerning princely authority and obedience thervnto belonging, what wil our knight say here, or how wil he defend vnity in verity to be amōg his brethrē in this so principal & capital a poynt, or how wil he satisfie her Maiestie her

               But if we leaue the Prince and come to Bishops, which is the second principal member of their churche and body, their disagreement is much more notorious, then in the former. For as the protestant speaketh honorably of them, so doth the Puritan quite contrary: calling them;Dangerous posit. lib. 20. cap. 12.

                  ort of the same Caluinian sect, who are distinguished from the others by the name of moderate Protestants, that do follow, for their rule of faith and religion, the prescript of Parlament, and her Maties. proceedings.
               
                   But now besides this contrariety of positions, there is yet another dissention among these brethren, more important then all the rest, which is their disagreing, and capital enimity

about the interpretation of Scriptures,VVarre in expounding scriptures. wherunto all matters being by both their iudgments to be referred, and all other iudges and trials left a side, as they require, they come to fal out presently about the sense and interpretation, wherin it is affirmed by their owne wryters, that so many men, so many myndes and so many diuers interpretations among them-selues of the selfesame words of scripture, are to be found, as yow may see set downe at large in another book of the softer Caluinists set forth by the same publike authority as the former, and intituled A suruey of the pretented holy Discipline imprinted at London An. 1593. especially in the 31. Chapter, whose title is this. How and with what disagreement they wrest and misconster the scriptures, &c. Where hauing shewed by many examples that fiue or six diuers interpretations are giuen sometymes vpon one and the selfe same sentence of scripture, by these his puritane brethren. He addeth further these wordes.Suruey. c. 31. Caterbraulis. of Protestāts and Puritās. 
                  Vnto these Caterbraules and pitiful distractions, (which now I haue shewed) I might ad a great heape of other confusions, all proceeding from such intollerable presumption, as is vsed, by peruerting and false interpretation of the sacred Scriptures. And agayne, whosoeuer doth deale with the Scriptures in this sort, (as these fellowes do) wel may he speake proud things, exalt himselfe, promise mountaynes, brag of the Prophets, & Apostles, but in the end all cometh to nothing, &c.
               
               Loe heere what this brother sayth of the  rest, of the caterbraules, and pittiful distractions

from them, of their intollerable presumption in peruerting, and false interpreting scriptures, of their swelling pryde, in bragging of hauing the prophets, and Apostles on their syde, when they haue nothing but vanitye, & yet these brags of scriptures, prophets and Apostles, must be good and currant proofe, when they deale with vs against the authoritye of the vniuersal Churche, as yow shal see by O.E. in the next Chapter, and when we tel them of any diuision among themselues, they wil deny it on all handes, as Syr F. doth heere of the Puritanes, and O. E. afterward, though he hath written against them most spitefully and doggedly (for he hath no other style as it seemeth) and fynally let all men iudge but especially the reader, whom it most importeth for his instruction, with what truth, and conscience Syr F. can say and wryte as he doth (matters stāding as I haue shewed) that not only the professors of their ghospel in England, but all other Churches also in Christendome, where the ghospel is imbraced are of one Iudgement, and thervpon cō
                  clude with this hypocritical prayer to mock God withall, And in this blessed vnitie grounded vpon veritie the Lord for euer keepe vs. Whervnto I say also amen, so long as they remaine enemies to Gods Catholike Churche wherin only veritie and vnitie is to be found.
            
            
               
               AN ANSVVERE TO three fond obiections, or interrogations of Syr F. with an addition about O. E. who is called vp agayne to the stage to tell his opinion about this first blessing of vnitie in veritie. CAP. VII.
               AND this now might be sufficient for  refutation of this first ridiculous blessing set downe by the knight were it not that I am forced to follow him, yet a litle further, into an other poynt, which is, that he forseing how albeit this first blessing of vnitie among them could be proued (as it cannot) yet might it not be alleaged for a peculiar blessing of his men, except it could be shewed also, that it were singular to them alone, and not commō also to Catholikes, before they, and their religion sprong vp, for if we had vnitie also in fayth before them, then cannot vnitie be accompted their blessing, more then ours, for which cause he endeauoureth to shewe, that Catholikes had no vnitie of fayth before Luthers ghospel began, which paradox he wil needs proue by three graue interrogations, which I pray yow note, and therby obserue the mans singular wit, and learning.
               
                  Yow vaunt (sayth he) of a general vnitie before alteration  of religion,
                  Pag. 13. 
                  but how worshipped yow one God, when yow worshipped so many Idols?

And so this question is both ydle, and easy to answere, for the consequent, but for the antecedent it is most false, for we deny that any Idols were among Catholikes.August. de vtilitate ieiunij tomo 9.

                   Secondly he asketh agayne, how we could haue vnitye, when as we were so miserably rent into innumerable sectes of fryers, and monkes? To which I answere, that all these professed one fayth without any difference in any one article of beliefe. And consequently this question is more simple then the former, for that difference of habytes, or particular manner of lyfe breaketh not vnity of religion.
               
                   Thirdly he asketh, and vrgeth yet more sharpely, how cā yow haue one head of your Churche, vnles yow reiect Christ, that is the onely head? To this I wil answere out of his owne wordes, that we can haue one external, and ministerial head vnder Christ by the same reason, that himselfe in the same place sayth, that English Protestants haue one head of their Churche, which is Christ the Lord, and his substitute annoynted their Soueraigne Q. vnder him. So that yf it do not

exclude Christ among the Protestants to haue a womā head of their Churche vnder Christ, much lesse doth it exclude Christ among vs, to haue a man head, & a Priest head, & of this reason I am content to make any man iudge.
               And with this I wil end my treatise of the first benediction of vnitie in veritie, which is as truly, and fitly applyed to Protestants, as if a man should assigne it for a special blessing of Greeks and Germanes aboue other nations, neuer to exceed in drinking, or of those of Guinea, neuer to fal out, or fight among themselues, who neuer lightly are occupyed in other things.
               And lastly I wil close vp all with the sentence, and prophesy of no worse a man then Martyn Luther himselfe,Luthers prophesye of Protestants. coment in Psalm. 5. who wryteth thus, Certè non alia ratione confligit Deus cum haereticis, quam vt inter illos existat factiosus quidam dissensionis spiritus; ex

Trulie God doth not fight by any other meanes with heretikes, then by permitting among them a certayne seditious spirite of dissentiō, by which their ouerthrow also and perdition doth ensue. Thus said Luther a man ful of your ghost and extraordinarily enlightened which the spirite of protestants; whose Father and founder he was, and he speaketh of yow and yours in particuler to wit, Zwinglians & Caluinists & therfor yow may beleeue him if yow wil, and thus much to the K. about this controuersie now to his champion the martial Minister.
               
                  
                   I dismissed from the stage some two or three chapters past (if yow remember) syr F. his procter O.E. to cunne a new his part against he should be called vpon againe,O. E. is cauled vp to the stage. now his cu cometh in to say a word or two more, and so we must needs make him roome though very briefly, for he hath littel or no matter of substance at all to entertein vs withall in this place.
               First then albeit he holdeth and affirmeth resolutely as the knight doth that on his syde there is no diuision at all of any moment in matters of Religion, but that all disagreement is among vs,Vnitye no blessing vvith O. E. yet doth he not put this vnitie of his people in the Catalogue of his blessings receaued by the new ghospel, and this perhaps for that he hauing written so eagerly against the Puritanes (as he is said to haue done) he dareth not admit them now so easely to the vnion of brethren, as Sr. F. doth, who is held for a great proselite or rather patrō of theirs, which matter shal be discussed more particulerly afterward in this Encounter. Now we are to treate only of this first benediction of vnitie among Protestants, wherunto, (as I said) the Minister vouchsafeth not to geue any place in his list of benedictions, though it haue the first and chiefest in that of S.F. from whom this honest man differeth not a litle though both agree in the number of ten.Pag. 4. Let vs heare this mās Role, he saith that his blessings are of two sortes spiritual, and temporal, six of the one sorte, and fower of the other,

the spiritual are these, as he recounteth them.O.E. his decalogue of blessings. 1. deliuerance from the Popes decretals 2. Scriptures in English, 3. true administration of Sacramēts, 4. true worship of Christ, 5. fredome from persecution. 6. abolishing of Romayne Rytes. The temporal are. 1. deliuerance from the thraldome of Spanyards. 2. abolishing of the Popes exactions. 3. peace restored to the land, 4. the strength of the Realme greatly increased.
               
               This is his decalogue of blessings, wherby  if no other argument were of the disagreeing spirite of these fellowes among themselues, this might serue for one, to consider the difference betweene this list, and that of Sr. F. (which yet must needs be presumed that this man had viewed, the same hauing byn published so long before his) for if yow compare them together, yow shal fynd singuler 
                     •
                  arring in so short a matter,Disagreing in the names and qualities of blessinges. for that fyue or six of Sr. F. Blessings are quite lefte out by the Minister, to wit, vnity in veritie, publique prayer in English, aboūdant exercise of good works, power in forrayne countryes, and multitude of subiectes seuenfold increased. The first spiritual also and the 2. temporal are all one, and the 5. spiritual of freedome of persecution seemeth rather temporal, then spiritual.
               And on the other syde the knightes head  conceaued not perhaps that the abolishing (for example) of Romane Rytes, was a distinct blessing from the other of deliuerance from the Popes authoritie, and decreetals, as the Minister maketh it, or that their true administration

of Sacraments, and their true worshipping of Christ (being general poynts) could enter into the ranke of particular blessings, more then all the rest of their religion, or lastly that the deliuerance from Spaniards may be accompted an effect of the English ghospel, hauing byn also in so many ages before, when Englād was Catholike, for which cause he omitted these blessings in his Catalogue, but finally these are arbitrary matters, and deuises of their owne braynes, & therfore no maruayle though each man haue his owne.
               
                   And this is so much in effect as we haue to heare from Oedipus our Minister at this tyme, about this first and chiefe blessing of Sr. F. which this man disauoweth as yow haue seene, though yet as, I haue noted a litle before when we come to the poynt to vrge him with dissention among his people, he denyeth it flatlie, and braueth more then any other, for heare his wordes in this place, speaking of the warders speach about their diuision. VVhere the warder saith he, affirmeth that we are deuided not only frō the general body of Catholikes in Christēdome, but also from our selues, he telleth vs his owne dreame, and fancyes, fleeting in his ydle brayne without any ground or truth.
               
               
                   Lo heere (good reader) his resolute answere, but whether I haue any groūd of truth or no, thow hast seene in the former three or fower chapters about their diuisions and when thou hearest such desperate deuyals of

all groundes, & withal seest on the other syde so many and great, groundes, it may frame a iudgement in thee of their māner of proceeding, and of their resolution to breake wilfully through what hedge or wall of truth soeuer standeth betweene them, or in their way.
               And yet I cānot but warne thee also in this  place for this whole book, and once for all, that neuer lightly shal it be foūd that this cogging Minister, alleaging my wordes, doth alleage them truly, and sincerely, but altereth, leaueth out, or addeth at his pleasure, though on the other syde he putteth them downe in different letter, as myne owne precisely, & if I would nūber his knacks in this kynd, throughout his reply I should make of this point only a whole volume, yet shal I geue a note here and there when the matter commeth to purpose as heere now thow maist take a taste, for I said in the VVardword.
                  Pag. 4. 
                  VVe English of the new profession are not only different, and deuided from the general body of Catholikes in Christendome with whom we were vnited before, but also amōg our selues, and with other new sectaryes sprong vp with vs, and after vs,

Now then let vs passe on to the remnant of Sr. F. Blessings.
            
            
               
               OF THE SECOND AND third blessings, which are, reading of scriptures and publike seruice in English. CAP. VIII.
               HOw trew the former first blessing hath  bene of vnitie in veritie we haue sufficientlie (I think) declared;Conditions of true blessings. Now folow the other nine about which we must remember that which before hath byn touched to wit, that to proue them peculiar and special blessings of Protestants, it must be shewed that they were not among Catholikes before, and thē also that they are matters of such weight and moment as they do or may deserue the name of blessings, and yet further that they are trulie found in deed in Protestants doctryne, and not feigned or supposed by our knights only fancie or imagination, and lastlie that they are general and vniuersal to the whole Churche of Protestantes, and so according to these fower conditions, and circumstances of true blissings we shal examine the rancke of them that do ensue, & in this chapter some 2. or 3. of them seuerallie.
               Wherfore to come to the matter, he sayth  that his second blessing is,The second blessing about reading scriptures in English. 
                  that the scriptures are now in English for euery man and womā to read, &c. This blessing, say I, hath not the 
                     •
                  ormer conditions required, for first it is not general to all, seing that such as vnderstood the latyn tōgue

before, receyue no blessing herby, nor yet those that had licence before vnder the Catholikes from their ordinaries and pastors (for that was alwayes permitted as the world knoweth) to read scriptures in the English tongue haue receyued any blessing therby, so that this benediction must needs be restrayned to those people alone, that being simple and ignorant of the latyn tongue, were accompted before by their pastors and Prelates vnfit to profit by such reading of scriptures at their pleasure in their vulgar tongue, but rather had need to be instructed otherwise, and to haue so much scripture deliuered to them by other meanes of cathechismes, homiles, preachings and such like instructions, as they were capable of, without laying opē to them the whole corps of scriptures to conster and misconster as their fancies should aford them.
               This was the censure and iudgement of the Catholike Churche before Protestants arose, which course our knight calleth darknes an

knel) in king Edwards dayes,Stovv anno 1549 Edovvardi 6. reg. anno. 3. who being a simple woman, but yet heady and wilful by reading scriptures in English learned to hold and defend that Christ had not takan flesh of his mother the Virgyn, In like manner I aske, was it a blessing to the tanner of Colchester her copsmate,Stovv Ibid. who picked out of reading scriptures that Baptisme was worth nothing, & so held to his death, affirming that he could defend the same by playne and euident scriptures, so as neyther Cranmer Archbishop of Canterburie, nor the rest of the Protestants in those dayes (who had taught them to read scriptures) could conquere, or cōuert them by scriptures, but were fayne to burne them with fyre for the good effect proceeding of this their owne blessing (if it be a blessing) wherby all are permitted, and inuited to read scriptures in English.
               George Paris also a simple duitchman was burned by the said Archbishop in the same kings raigne,Stovv & Holinsead Ibid. for houlding, that Christ was not equal to his Father which he auouched to haue learned out of the sacred bible, that he had studyed in his owne language, and could not be dryuen from it by any disputatiō of Cranmer, Rydley, or any other our English ministers, but only by the fyre, which at length they vsed, to conuert him into ashes.
               In this Queenes dayes also at the verie beginning when scriptures were first published  in English,Stovv. anno 1561. Reg 3. Elizab. William Geffrey and Iohn More did read so earnestlie, and interprete so soundlie

as they learned to hold, and affirme, that Christ was not in heauen, & were whipped publikelie for the same, vntil they confessed the contrarie: so as the reading scriptures in English was no blessing to these men but onlie a blessing with a whip as yow wil confesse.
               
                   In the 17. yeare also of her Maiesties raigne, when 27. Anabaptists vulgar people were apprehended togither,Stovv an. 1575. & 1576. and punished in London by order of the L. Mathew Parker of Canterburie, for denying Christ to haue taken flesh, and other such opinions, and two of them burned in Smythfeild, and fiue others of the familie of loue, brought in publike pennance at Paules crosse for heresies, who all auouched notwithstanding, that they had drawne their newe doctryne out of the reading of scriptures in the vulgar tongue, what blessing I pray yow was this to thē, or to such other as haue fallen into other sectes since that tyme, both of Brownisme, Puritanisme, & other fancyes condemned by the Protestants themselues, & detested by the present state of Englād, which yet they had neuer done (by all likelihood) if this publike reading of scriptures without restraint or due moderation had not byn permitted to the ignorant:Systers of London in the suruey of dang
                        •
                     erous positions. Those busy sisters of London also, and other citties wherof the late protestāt wryters do so much complayne in their books against Puritanes, who gad vp & downe with English bibles vnder their armes, and wil defend any thing against any man out of scriptures, would not so much

haue troubled eyther themselues, their husbands or the common wealth if this blessing had not byn permitted to them, or if it may be accompted a blessing, and not a cursing that maketh both them and other ignorant people so mad and franticke in heresie.
               So as now it is to be considered, whether  the blessing of Catholikes be greater, among whom this promiscuous libertie of reading scriptures in vulgar tongues is not permitte
                     •
                  , but rather moderated by choice of persons, or els the new fashion of protestantes permitting all to all sortes without exception or difference eyther of sexes, condition, capacitie age, ability, or other fitnes, & when this poynt is wel pondered I think Syr F. his second blessing wil proue a very poore one, euen in the iudgmēt of those that be wyse & discreet of his owne professiō. But let vs goe forward to the third for of this we shal haue occasiō to speake againe in the 2. Encounter more largely.Encount. 2. cap. 7. & 8.
               
               His third blessing is, that they haue not onlie
                   
                  the Scriptures,
                  The

                     , blessing of publique seruice in English. 
                  but also their common Churche seruice in a vulgar tongue; the weight of which blessing may in parte be pondered by that which hath byn sayd about his second: for if the necessitie or Scriptures in the English tongue to euery particular man & woman be so smal as before hath byn shewed (many thousands both protestants and others being within the land euen at this day that cannot or do not read them, and yet may be saued, as I thinke he wil not deny) and that to some the reading also

hath byn pernicious and not a blessing bu

                   rather cursing through their owne insufficiency (as by former examples I haue sh

                  wed) much lesse necessitie is there of publike seruice in vulgar tongues, seing that publike seruice is appoynted to be said or song to the prayse of God and in the name of all the people by publike Priests and other ecclesiastical officers appoynted thervnto, nor is it needful alwayes for the people to be present at it, bu

Iohn Baptist of whom S. Luke the Euangelist wryteth: that according to the custome of Priesthood in those dayes he wēt vp into the temple when his lot came to offer publike incense, adding as concerning the people,Luc.

All the multitude of the people did pray without; during the tyme of his incense, that is to say, whyle he performed his office of publike Sacrifice, the people stood a loofe and prayed by themselues, wherby we may perceyue that the people in tyme of publike seruice and sacrifice among the Iewes (in place wherof S. Augustine sayth that Christ hath appoynted his sacrifice of the Masse among Christians) did not intermedle in the publike seruice,Aug lib 17. de ciui

or other such parte of the seruice as is generallie to be performed by al.
               Wherof it foloweth that it is not necessarie  that all publike seruice in Christian Churches should be in the vulgar tongues of euery nation & country,Not necessary for the cōmon people to vnderstand the publi
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      seruice. nor do we read that euer it was ordinarily but in the three learned languages of Hebrue, Greeke and Latyn: sanctifyed by Christ in the tytle of his Crosse, nor is it conuenient (as ancient Fathers do testifie) that all things which are handled in Churche seruice praesertim in sacris misterijs (to vse their wordes) should be vnderstood by all vnlearned people in their owne vulgar languages,Dion. lib. de Eccles. Hierarch cap. 1. Orig hom. 5. in numerū. Basil lib. de spiritu sancto ca. 27. Chrys. hom. 24. in Matth Greg. lib 4. Dialog. cap. 56. and so doth teach both S. Dionisius scholler to S. Paul, Origen, S. Basil, S. Chrysostome, S. Gregory & other Fathers, for which reuerent respect it is like amōg other causes, that the said common Churche seruice hath euer byn vsed in one of the said learned tongues.
               As for example in Iurye it selfe and Hierusalem  it is euident that the publique seruice was in the Hebrue tongue,Comon seruice in Iury not in vulgar tongue. which yet was not the vulgar tōgue, nor vnderstood commonlie by the people without an interpreter as appeareth lib. 2. Esdrae. cap. 8.
               And that the Syrian tongue was the vulgar language of the Iewes in Christs tyme appeareth clearlie by the words Talitha cumi,
                  Marc. 5. Matth. 27. Marc. 14. 
                  hacheldema, golgatha, Pascha, abba and other such, recorded by the Euangelists, which are no Hebrue, but onlie Syriak wordes, as all learned men know.
               
                  
                   And as for the Apostles them-selues after Chri
                     •
                  t though they had the gifte of all languages, and did both found Churches ouer all the world, and appoynted them their order of seruice and other poynts necessarie therunto belonging, as both by their owne wrytings, and other Apostolical Authors ensuing after them,Rom. 10. Coloss. 1. Irenaeus li. 1. cap. 3. is euident, yet shal we neuer read that they wrote to any of these particular nations or to their Churches in vulgar languages but onlie in one of the three former tongues, as hath byn said.
               Neyther can it be shewed out of any Author of Antiquitie whatsoeuer, that any Christian Catholike country since the Apostles tyme had publike seruice in any language but in one of those three except by some special dispensation from the Pope and vpon special consideration for some limited time.
               
                   But on the contrarie we can shew innumerable testimonyes out of all Antiquitie for the vse of one of these three tongues (for reading of Scriptutes and publique seruice of euery nation.Seruice in Greeke.) As of the Greeke tongue in Syria,

Hierome is of the Churche of Rome, (as after shal be proued) where no man can doubt, but that the seruice was in Latyn and consequentlie the example is euel brought to proue seruice in a vulgar language, and secondlie it is no maruayle though the people sounded out Amen, in Rome where most men vnderstood the Latyn tongue and those that did not, yet might they easelie vnderstand by vse what the word, Amen. signifyeth and when it is to

out the word Amen, to the likenes of an heauenlie thunder?
               
                   Heere now we see the Romanes faith highlie praysed by S.The Catholike deuotiō of Rome. Hierome and proued to be more excellent then of any other Christians in the world for their earnest deuotion and running to Churches and sepulchers of martyrs, this if Syr F. had put downe sincerlie as it lyeth in S. Hierome it would haue marred his market, and giuen a great buffet to his religion as yow see, speciallie if he had added the wordes immediatlie following in S. Hierome,S. Hier. Ibid. which are these. Non quod altam habeant Romani fidem, nisi hanc, quam omnes Christi Ecclesiae, sed quod deuotio in e
                        •
                     s maior sit & simplicitas ad credendum. The fayth of Rome is speciallie praysed by the Apostels aboue others, not for that the Romanes had a different fayth from that which all other Churches of Christ do hould, but that their deuotion, and simplicitie in beleeuing was greater then the rest.
               
                   By which words is euident, first that in S. Hieromes tyme the Romayne faith was accompted the general Catholike faith of all Christendome which Romayne faith (as after more largelie shal be demōstrated) was sent into Britany by Pope Eleutherius before S. Hieromes tyme,Enc. 7. c. 6.7. & after his tyme brought into England agayne by S. Augustine the monke at S. Gregoryes appoyntment, so as twise we haue had communication & participation of this Romayn faith so higlie cō
                  mended by S. Paul and S. Hierome.
               
                  Secondlie it is to be noted that the things most praysed in the Roman fayth by S. Hierome are two poyntes most scorned at by our Protestants, to wit simplicitie in beleeuing without disputing or curiouslie asking reasons, and secondly promptenes of deuotion in visiting Churches, martyrs Sepulchers and the like: for which two poynts of simplicitie in beleeuing and deuotion S. Hierome is of opinion that S. Paul did so speciallie commend the Romanes in his dayes; which poynts being so farre different from the iudgments and affections of the protestants of our dayes, no maruaile though Syr F. heere would not let vs see S. Hieromes whole sentence, but a peece only cut out, as he thought best, for his purpose, and yet this peece also not truly nor faithfullie aleadged, as now shal be shewed.

These are S. Augustines words, and let the reader iudge whether these be spoken of any corporal singing psalmes or saying seruice in particuler Churches and congregations or rather of inward iubilation of spirit which S.

I meane to be much shorter in the rest wherfore there foloweth the fourth blessing which Syr F. bringeth in, as peculiar to protestants (for otherwise it were no blessing obteyned by change of religion) which is the rare and singular good lyfe of Protestāts, called by this blessing bringer,Pag. 18. their exercise in workes of true pietye, and in his marginal note and ranke of blessings, The exercise of true Holinesse, which is a strāge blessing, if a man consider wel of it, that the exercise of good works, and true holynes was brought in onlie or principallie by Protestants of our dayes, for first the experience of the whole world wil deny it, and cry out against it, and secondlie there best frends, who speake most of their faith wil and do renounce their woorks as for example, Erasmus among other,Fox in the lyfe of Bilney and other first protestants.

               And Syr F. least he should goe to farre in  this matter of good workes saith:Tvvo cautions of the K. against good vvorkes. we must take heed to auoid two extremities. The first proud presumption before God, that we put no opinion of merit in our workes, secondlie that before men we auoid all hypocritical ostentation. Lo heere good reader, two great peryls of good workes layd before thee, but no vtilityes remēbred. Trulie I had thought, when I heard him talke of two extremityes, that as the one was to attribute to much to good workes, so the other should haue byn to

attribute to litle, but both are, cautiōs against good workes, and therfore I maruaile how they may be called extremities,Absurdity. seing they may be both in one and the selfe same man, to wit, presumpsion & hipocrisy, which yet is against the nature of extremes, yf S. F. remember wel his Sophistry learned in Oxford.
               
               
                   But marke I pray yow the difference of spirit and Doctrine in these men from holy Scripture, which euery where encorageth vs exceedingly with the merit and reward of good workes,Math. 5. Rom 2. 7. Cor; & 9. Coloss 1 1. Timoth 2. Iam 2. 2. Pet. 1. 2. Pet. 1. as also that they should shine before men, wheras our Protestāts are careful to warne vs, that they are perilons things, to engender presumption; and ostentation. Wher-vnto their Father Luther addeth further that they are also pernicious to saluatiō, which yf yow ponder wel is but a cold exhortation to the exercise of good workes,Luth.

                   And as for Syr F. himselfe, notwithstanding his protestatiō afterward, that he would be loath to yeild to any Papist whatsoeuer in

this poynt of good workes (seing it is a peculiar blessing of his people as yow see) yet I do not heare nor vnderstand that this blessing doth so abound in him for the practise,Syr F. not so famous for good vvorkes as he vvould seeme. as that his tenants, and neighbours wil be his witnesses thervnto, especiallie if the common fame be true of certayne things which heere I wil not name for christian modestie sake, & for respect eyther of himselfe, or his familie, or of both, though he in his owne person litle sheweth to deserue that respect, not hauing held the same with others of greater moment, yea princes themselues; but I shal deale more modestlie with him, and let him goe free from further

               And with this I might end this poore protestant blessing of good works (especially seeing that after againe I am to treat of the same subiect) but that our knight wil needs alleadge S. Bernard for his former caution against the merit of good workes in these

words;Cap. 15. S. Bernard abused. 
                  Bona opera sunt via regni, non causa regnandi, which he according to his fashion fraudulentlie expoundeth thus; good works are the way wherein we must walke to the kingdome of heauen, but not the cause wherfore we shal obtayne that kingdome, &c.
               
                   Wherein first yow must note that he vseth heere also his foresaid old shifte, not to quote the place, or book where we may fynd this in S. Bernard, least he should be taken tripping as a litle before, about the other two Fathers S. Hierome, & S. Augustine, yet hauing sought much in S. Bernard at length we fynd the place in the verie end of an excellent treatise he wrote,Catholike doctrine about merites of good vvorkes. 
                  De gratia & libero arbitrio, shewing therin how Gods grace doth concurre with mans freewil in all meritorious workes, by stirring vp mans wil to worke with promise of reward, and strengthening him to the performance therof by the assistāce of his diuyne grace, in respect wherof, to wit, of the free promise made by God to reward our good workes, (wherto he was not bound) and of the preuenting, and assisting vs by his holie grace to the working of the same, our merites are to be attributed vnto him, as to the first and chiefe efficient cause, and not to our selues, though our concurrance be necessarie thervnto also, and in this sense S.

Bernard doth explicate most excellentlie a litle before in the same place, his wordes are these, hauing

                  Wheras it is certayne that these good workes (by me before mentyoned) are wrought in ys by the spirit of God, they must needs be called the giftes of God, And for that they are done also by the consent of our wil they are our merits.
               
               
                   Thus sayth he, and then doth he prosecute the same with a large and learned discourse vpō the words of S. Paul to Timothie, where he sayth, Bonum certaemen certaui, &c. I haue fought a good fight,

Vpon which wordes S. Bernard sayth thus: If it be so that the verie wil of doing good in S. Paul (wherof all merit doth depend) was not his owne, but receyued from God, how doth he cal it a croune of Iustice, which he assureth himselfe to be layd vp for him? is it (perhaps) for that whatsoeuer is freelie promised, it may be iustlie, after the promise made required as due debt, &c. he saith further; for that S. Paul beleeued the promiser, he now confidentlie exacteth the promise, which promise though it were of mercy, yet now it is to be payd of iustice, &c. For it is iust that God should pay whatsoeuer he oweth, and he oweth whatsoeuer he hath promised, &c.

and of this iustice it pleased God to make Paul a partener,Iustitiae Paulum Deus voluit habere consortem vt & coronae faceret promeritorem. Bern. pag. 1069. to the end he might make him also a deseruer of his crowne, and in this he made him both partener of his iustice and deseruer of his crowne, when he vouchsafed to make him his helper or coadiutor in doing good works, wherunto his crowne is promised, & further he made him his coadiutor, when he made him to consent to his holy wil and motion.
               
               Lo heere how S. Bernard doth connect &  ioyne togeather the operation of God, and cooperation of man in the matter of merit, attributing to God the first and principal motion of grace, mercy, promise, and inabling vs to worke, and vnto man that he concurreth freely by cooperation with, Gods instinct, so as the reward of this worke, which is the Kingdome of heauen yf we respect the first cause which is God, it is mercy, and yf we consider the secondary instrumental cause, which is man, & the promise of God made vnto him, it is called iustice and dew debt, let vs heare S. Augustine in the same matter,Aug. hom. 14. lib 50. homiliarum. 2. Tim. 4. and vpon the same words of the Apostle: For the rest (saith the Apostle) there remayneth to me a crowne of iustice, which God the iust iudge shal restore to me at the last day. Behould he saith that God shal restore a crowne vnto him, ergo he is his debter.Aug. in Psal. 
                        ••
                     . And againe in another place: vnde debitor? accepit aliquid, &c.
                  Whence is God become a debter? hath he receyued any thing, or doth he owe any thing to any man▪ and

yet behould Paul doth hold him for his debter, saying, God shal restore vnto me, &c. what shal he restore vnto thee (Paul) but that which he oweth? whence doth he owe any thing vnto thee? what hast thow giuen vnto him? Truly God hath made himselfe a debter, not by receyuing any thing, but by promising, so as yt may not be said vnto him, restore that which thow hast receyued, but pay that which thow hast promised.
               
               
                   Thus do wryte these holy Fathers, shewing how God becometh debiter to the merits of our good works not by their owne nature, but by his owne voluntary free promise and mercy, yet deny they not the truth of this merit nor blaspheme yt as our fōd K. doth, saying that it is a proud presumption before God to put any opinion of merit to our works:
                  Pag. 19. but yow haue heard out of the Fathers, how they do not only put opinion of merit in good works, but do plainly affirme and teach yt, and that it is dew debt, supposing Gods promise made to reward them: Wherof also it followeth, that albeit the saying of S. Bernard be most true in the sense alleadged, that our merits be the way to the Kingdome of heauen, but not the cause, speaking of the first and principal cause, yet were those words not truly, but frandulently translated by our K. that they are not the cause, wherfore we shal obtayne the Kingdome, as though they were no cause at all, which is false and absurd, for that noe man can deny them to be the instrumental meritorious causes of obtayning

heauen, seing God hath promised heauen as a reward vnto them, and hauing promised is bound in iustice to preforme the same, as now yow haue heard by the Fathers declared. And so much of this matter for this place.

                  Pag. 20. About which blessing I would aske the K. certayne questions therby to come to the truth of the matter & auoyd impostures: and first I would aske him, whether this freedome from persecution be common to all, or to some only, that is to protestants: and then whether this be passiue or actiue in them: that is whether they stand out free in them-selues or do suffer other men also to be free from persecutiō, for yf it be not a common blessing to all but particular to themselues, then can yt not be called a blessing of the land, but of some part within the land. And againe yf it be passiue only and enioyned by them-selues and not actiue, so as they procure nor yeild not the same freedome to others, where they may, then is it absurdly called a blessing or benediction, for that theeues also, and the worst men of the world among them-selues, or to others of their crew do not vse persecution:Matth. 12. Marc. 3. Luc. 11. nay diuels also (as Christ signifieth) do not fight one against

another, and yet that this is not true in protestants but that they persecute one another also where they fal to difference of opinions is a thing so euident as needeth no proof and the examples alleadged by me before out of all the sects of Germany, Switzerland and other countreys,Kēnit. epist. ad Io.

Is this the blessed freedome which protestants ghospel hath brought in? Surelie I wil end, and shut vp this absurditie with those wordes of S. Augustine against Iulian the famous heretike.Aug. contr.

his ghospel and change of religion in the prayse and disprayse of that which hath ensued, as if they could not possibly be seuered in the effectes of blessings and cursings therof proceeding, which poynt I hold to be most false and flattering, assuring my selfe, & presuming also, that any man of iudgement and discretion wil be of my opinion that whatsoeuer good effectes haue come to our common wealth by her Maiesties gouernment, or rare partes of Princelie commendations,A note to be diligently obserued. and which truelie may be termed blessings, might haue byn as great as all these, or farre greater vnder Catholike religion, and especiallie in her Maiestie if it had pleased almightie God to haue blessed her and the realme with the continuance therof, and contrariwyse whatsoeuer cursings and calamities on the contrarie syde haue ensued, or may ensue herafter by the change of religion these are proper effectes, and necessary consequēts of the new ghospel, and not of any defect in her Maiesties gouernment and this foundatiō being presupposed in all that I shal say, let vs passe on to examine in a word or two, the most ridiculous vanitie of these fiue blessings folowing which he calleth corporal, accompting his former spiritual.

I do not wel see, and yf we compare it with the great & large prouinces we had before vnder Catholike Religion, and especiallie with the change of our old mighty and honorable allyes, and confederated Princes to our new gotten frends, we shal soone discouer the fayntnes and fondnes of this blessing, which is seene also by the qualitie of those persons, and their cause, which our K. braggeth to haue had their refuge in England vnder a womans

I meane, power with power, riches with riches, multitude of seruāts, with multitude of seruāts house-keeping with house-keeping, and other such like effectes of wealth and riches, I doubt me much how S.

Moreouer as this K. is lauish in bragging of riches and voluntarie warres, so is his boasting, playnlie Thrasonical when he talketh of his owne going, and assistance to the same warres. For in his Epistle of his wach-word to the Reader he telleth him verie seriouslie, & with big wordes, that to himselfe he hath set downe this law,
                  Thrasonical boasting. 
                  that shal neuer be repealed that if his wealth were millions; if he could bring thousands of fighting handēs to the feild; yf his lyfe were ten thousand liues, his wealth, his strength, his lyfe and all should goe to be spent, hazarded, and ended, against that Antichrist of Rome,

and the ambitious tyrant of Spayne, &c. And that with confidence, boldnes, and assurance of the goodnes of his cause, he and his fellowes with hart and hand wil be prest and ready to take their places, and to marche in the feild, and their to set forward with a swift foot against these enemies, &c.
               
               
                   Did euer glorious Thraso vpon the stage speak bigger wordes then these? and yet I do not heare that the K. in fact, is so great a kil-kow, as heere he maketh him-selfe, nor yet that in such warres as haue byn offred voluntarie, or inuoluntarie, hath he aduentured any one lyfe, or brought any one troop of fighting handes to the feild, nor hath byn so swyft of foot, as he is in wordes, but rather hath bene content to look on whiles others marched, and to sit at home with his Ministers whiles other men went to fight, and consequentlie that these wordes and wishes are farre greater then his actes, and gestes. And so much of this blessing.
               
                   Wherfore now to come to the last blessing, which is multitude of people,The 10. blessing encrease of people. encreased mightilie (as he sayth) since her Maties. first entrance to the crowne (a great blessing of God (sayth he) powred vpon this land, which God at the least hath seauen-fold encreased, to the number that at her entrance she found.
                  Pag. 27. If I should stand with this computist about the precise number of seauen-fold encreased, and aske him how he knoweth it? or who wil beleeue it? or how probable it is, that the people of Englād should be seauen tymes as many now as they were

fortie yeares agoe, I should (I thinke) pose him hardlie, and proue him (perhaps) no lesse lauish in this, then in the former, but yet supposing it were, or be so, how can this benediction (so poore a one at it is) be attributed as peculiar to his new ghospel, seing that, other religions engender also besyds Protestants. And for example, let vs imagine that Catholike religion had endured stil in England for these later 40. yeares, or that the Iewes or Turkes religion had byn in steed therof, would not the people haue encreased also vnder them thinke yow? yea much more vnder the later, for that they professe Poligamy and the multitude of many wyues, and yet were it much simplicitie to say that this encrease of Children were a special blessing of their religion, or testimonie of the truth therin conteyned.
               And the like may I say of Protestāts, though  I confesse that in this poynt of generation I do yeild them some priuiledge aboue Catholikes for that all sortes do marrie among them, and fewe or none do thinke of those Eunuches commended by Christ who geld them-selues for the Kingdome of heauen,

common wealth, let the Parishes, and Parishioners of England be asked, who by statute are bound to maintayne their brats, when the parents are not able.
               
                   And with this I wil end this goodly ranke of blessings, which are so vayne and fond as I may say to S.F. for bringing them foorth, as S. Augustine said to Faustus Manicheus about a like foolish narration,Aug. lib. 16. contr. Faust. Manich. cap. 2

maketh fyue, and lyke number of spiritual, so as the Minister according to his vocation is more spiritual by one blessing, then the Kt. and lesse corporal, though perhaps not lesse corpulent.

                  But not to step from England it self, where  principallie this blessing-bringer doth vaunt that his blessings are powred out in aboundance,England. let vs examyne the matter indifferentlie among our selues: we are Englishmen, & we talk to men of the same language and nation, that know our country and condition therof: and many haue seene the change, and knew the state of things therin before the alteratiō, or at leastwyse haue heard therof since by their fathers and grand-fathers, &c.
               
               Thus said I in the Wardword, and further I passed on to draw all kyndes of blessings to  two heads or branches spiritual and temporal,Tvvo kindes of blessings. and examined them both by diuers meanes and wayes as before hath bene touched, shewing, that not blessings, but cursings, not felicities but calamities had ensued euery where by this change; and especiallie warres, tumults, and garboyles, as now I haue declared. And to all this my declaration which is

Thus he fayth, & to this I replie, that if our knight had any consideration of his credit, he would neuer for shame affirme this so boldlie without answering to some of the examples alleaged by me against him, as also the asseuerations of his owne best doctors before mentyoned by me about this matter of obedience,En cont. 1 ca. 3.4. & 5. so as hauing both their doctryne, and practise to instruct vs, it is a great impudency to deny it so resolutelie; but let vs go forward.
               
                   When we came to the diuision mentyoned of spiritual and temporal blessings in particuler ensued to England by change of religion,Spiritual blessings before the change. First about spiritual benefits and benedictiōs, the warder setteth downe, how before the change of religiō 
                  men had one faith, one beliefe, one forme of seruice, one number of Sacraments, one tongue in celebratiō, one sacrifice, one head of the Churche together with the rest of Christendome, and that since the chāge all these things are altered for that English Protestants differ in all those poyntes, or the most, not only from all Catholike kingdomes, but also with their owne, and among themselues, to wit first from other new ghospellers

                  ish protestants agree with any secte of the Lutherans softe or riged, nor with the Zuinglians or Caluinists of other countryes, nor yet with those of our owne, as appeareth by the Churche of Scotland, and of the presbyteries of our Puritans in England, Holland, Zeland, and other places. For proof wherof it shal not need to repeat agayne the whole discourse of the wardword, for that this is sufficiētly proued by that I haue alleaged before about the first supposed blessing of vnity.
               To all which discourse of disvnion among  them set downe by the wardword Syr F. answereth no one thing,Syr Francis is mute in matters of most moment, Pag. 13. but only sayth, that it is a cunning tricke to grate so often vpon this diuision, calling some puritans, & some protestants, which he hopeth the Lord of might and mercy, wil turne to the good of the Churche, and direct the hartes of their Churchmen, to see how needful it is to ioyne both hart, & hand together to desend the doctrine of fayth (which they all hold) against the calumniations of slaunders wherwith you, and men of your sort (sayth he) seek to lead the truth of our profession.
               
               Behould heere a substantial defence, consisting  of foure poyntes, first he would gladly deny the difference of names & sectes of Of this difference see before, cap. 6 & 7. puritanes & protestāts, as cunningly deuised by vs what shifte wil ye cal this? Then he hopeth in the Lord of mercy they wil agree at length, but when and how?Encount. 1. cap. 3. After that by a parenthesis, he sayth, they all h

and wrytings alleaged by me to the contrary. And lastly he sayth, these are but slaunders deuised by vs to load the truth of their profession withall. This shift also I leaue to the reader to iudge of what quality it is, as in like manner of what modestie the K. is in denying matters so euidently knowne of all, noting by the way, that he dareth not to speak out,Syr F. of vvhat religion? and playnly vtter his mynd about this diuision of puritanes, and protestants in any place of his reply, nor yet to discharge him-selfe of the supition to be one of them, wherwith the warder often charged him, and he hath not denyed it flatly hitherto, nor yet fully confessed it, so as we must hold him eyther for neutral or ambidexter, vntil he declare him-selfe further, though in deed he doth sufficiently manifest him-selfe in this place by so many hems, and hammes, as he vseth in puritanes defence, saying, he trusteth God wil direct them to agree,
                  Pag. 13. 
                  and that howsoeuer some dissent hath appeared (as though in deed it were not) yet he doubteth not, but it shal be seene to the world that it is concordia discordia, with a discord that hath concord in yt, &c. Thus he salueth the matter for his tender affection towards the Puritans; wheras his Champion O.E. talking of this diuision, sayth playnly, and resolutely of them,Infra cap. 15. & 16. (as we shal treate more at large after-ward) that they are no more to be counted of protestants society, then the Papists that are of the Popes retinue, and thesame do say the Puritanes of protestants as before out of their owne wordes hath byn declared.

               First then to begin with that which the  warder layeth downe of diuers difficulties already growen in England by change of reliligion,

he sayth,Pag. 12. that to this, the state of things them-selues wil answere, lawes are ordinarily executed, no man is wronged eyther in his person, lands or goods, but he may haue remedy, religion is tru

                      preached, and professed, &c. Yow see how farre, & how plausibly he may runne counter in this poynt,VVhether change of religion be daungerous. and how substantially he proueth that there be no difficultyes by his owne onely denyal, but yet marke reader how soone after he putteth a moderation to this general assertion, granting some difficultyes, but denying the true cause.
               
                  
                  Secondly (sayth he) we say that howsoeuer w
                        •
                      stand, true religion is neyther the case of trouble nor danger, for if that were so, then were all Princes, & states that professe religion in the same case:Pag. 13. Loe how wyse a man he sheweth himselfe to be; first in his proposition, and then in his inference; his proposition is impertinent, that true religion bringeth no trouble, for we talke of protestant religion, which is foolery for him to presume that we graunt it to be true religion; and besydes this, we talke not of religiō it selfe, but of the changement, which in religion eyther true, or false may breed troubles in any common wealth: but especially the change of Catholike religion hauing bin for so many ages established and so many Princes and Monarches of the Christian woorld professing the same. His inference that all protestant Princes by this reason should be in trouble, is an ydle non consequent, for their cases may be different, their states vnequal, the máner

of change vnlike, and the proceeding therin, after an other fashion: but yet whether the protestant Princes of Christendome haue gayned or no by the change, or whether they be or may be in more daunger of troubles for separating themselues from the Catholike body of christian Princes, than yf they had continued in their Fathers religion, I leaue this to wyse men to iudge, and tyme to try.
               And this to his first inference, but besydes  this he hath a second in the same kynd no lesse foolish that if change of religion bringeth trouble, then all catholike Princes (that haue not changed) must enioy peace,
                  Fond inferrences. 
                  and be out of daunger, which is true, so farre foorth as cōcerneth this daunger arising by change, which is of no smal importance, seing it deuideth not only betweene them, and other Princes of different religion, but betweene them also, and their subiects, and if Catholike Princes haue had their troubles also, or daungers in our dayes, it hath bene eyther for other causes, or for that some in their states haue gone about to alter religion against thesayd Princes willes, as in France, and Scotland, Flanders, and other places, and so consequentlie change of religion (though not intended by them) hath byn the cause of their said troubles and dangers.
               But heare out the minister yet further;  
                  lastly (sayth he) yf religion now professed were the immediate cause, & original of any trouble like to ensue, then should not the Papists haue byn the principal meanes to moue warres, & rebellions against the state,

nor the only practisers against her Maiesties person, & safety, as we haue found them to haue byn. Thus he sayth, but how it hangeth together, God knoweth or the diuel that taught him to make this malitious consequence against innocent men, for I see not by any Cambridge or Oxford logicke how this illation may be founded, if chaunge of religion bring troubles, ergo why do Catholikes moue troubles? he hath brought this kynd of arguyng from the campe (no doubt) for he neuer found it in schoole; And as for the calumniation of this wicked assertion, that Catholikes are the only moouers of warres, and practisers against her Maiesties safety, the instance (I trow) of his late Mr. the Earle of Essex and the Puritanes,Essex attēpt, & the hopes of his follovvers. and other hungry protestants that set him a worke (wherin this fellow also perhaps hoped to haue no smal share if things had succeeded) doth sufficientlie cleare vs, and so both the forme of his argument, prouing him vnlearned, and the substance and matter dishonest, I leaue him for this first onset, and come to the second; for thus he goeth forward against me.
               
                  Pag. 14.
                  Yow see (sayth he) this Noddy hath neyther reason nor truth in his discourse, &c. he telleth vs that by alteration of Religion in England, Scotland, Ireland, Flanders & France haue tasted of many miseries, tumultes, calamityes, & desolations, he should haue said of many blessings, & frendly fauours. This needeth no reply if the reader be of any iudgment, for he can see the impudency of the assertion.

And then going forward to answere my enumeratiō of so many battails, murders distruction of so many coūtryes, prouinces, townes, cittyes, noble houses, linages, &c, occasioned by diuersitie, and change of religiō, he answereth thus:
               
                  As if we had procured all these battayles, murders, destructions,
                  The florish of the minister. 
                  as if we or our religion were the occasion, &c. what a shameles fellow is this to impute the cause o

All these big wordes, are but arguments of the Noddyes distracted mynd, &c.
               
               Lo (reader) what a manner of answering this is, and how many books might be made in this kynd of wryting? wherfore leauing this, let vs come to the matter of diuision in religion.

Were not this fellow worthier to be cuggelled then disputed withal? & his tongue rather to be putted out▪ then his pen answered by wryting? but he goeth forward saying, that I do ridiculously distinguish faith from beleefe, in that I do say, there was the

Chrysostome, as counterfet, he contradicteth himself by ignorance and malice, for that Iustine martyr and Dionise of Athens wrote noe lyturges, and the other three, which he reiecteth, togeather with that of S. Clement (which as litle he wil allow) are the onely lyturges; that are extant, so that if theise be counterfet, then are there noe Apostolike lyturges, for Iustyne and Dionise to describe, as he sayth they doe,Ciril Hierosol.

Peter Lombard Bishoppe of Paris,Sentent. lib. 4 dist. 2. commonly called M. of the sentences, & all other scoolemen after him doe set downe and handle distinctly seauen Sacramentes without any note of noueltie or contradiction made against them, which is an euident argument, that this was at that tyme also the common doctryne of the Catholyke Church. And albeit the auncient Fathers (as this man obiecteth) doe not set downe precisely this nomber of Sacraments in expresse wordes, and in one place all together, yet doe they set downe the thinges them-selues, and the same nomber also in different places, as by Catholyke writters is shewed aboundantly when they treate of the nomber of Sacraments.

But all this is answered largely by me before in the third blessing and eight and ninth chapters of this Encounter, and theise are manifest vntruthes, which he addeth heere, for he cannot shewe one exāple out of all antiquitie or histories that any one Catholyke country from Christ downewards to Luther vsed publike seruice in a vulgar tongue, but only in some of the three learned tongues Hebrewe Greeke or Latine, except only some perticular dispensation for some short tyme and vpon especial causes,Aeneas Syluius lib. de origine Bohemorum cap. 13. as is recorded of the Morauians where the Priests were permitted by the Pope to say masse in their Slauoniā vulgar tongue vntil they might be instructed in the Latyn, which maketh the second part of this obiection about the Greeke tongue to be very idle, and the third about S. Paule is true in prayses and exhortations

that, they ought not to be in peregrine tongues not vnderstood by the heares, but of publike prayer, it cannot be meant, nor haue place, for that in Corinth it was in the greeke tōgue which all commonly vnderstood. See here (good reader) the impertinencie of this fellow.
               Heere foloweth the fourth poynt, and  most famous falshood amongst the rest concerning one sacrifice throughout Christendome before the change of religion, wherof he sayth,A famous vntruth about the sacrifice of the Masse.

reproue and checke fiue ancient Fathers by name, that is Irenaeus, Athanasius, Arnobius, Ambrose, and Augustine for holding this doctryne, and misinterpreting and falselie applying the scriptures to the proofe therof,Vbi supra.

E. that dare auouch the sacrifice of the Masse was neuer so much as knowne to the ancient fathers.

                   foloweth in the Ward-word, that not onlie the Protestants haue no present vnion in doctrine amōg them-selues,In certaynty of beliefe among protestants. See of this sup. cap 4. num. 10. but also that it is impossible that euer they can haue it, which is as great a spiritual curse, and malediction as may be, and this for lack of due meanes to procure or establish the same. And to this purpose the K. is hardlie posed by the warder about the certaintie of his fayth and religion to wit, how he can haue any, and by what infallible meanes he can be sure that he is in the right way, and not in heresie, and seing that he, and his do make scriptures their onelie assurance, & this dependeth of the true sense, he is asked, and vrged, whether he hath this certaintie of Scripture by his owne reading onlie and iudgment or by the credit of some ministers that enterpret the Scriptures in this or that sense vnto him, and whether soeuer of these two wayes he stand vpō it is shewed and proued to be vncertayne, the first depending onelie of the owne iudgment, the second of others, who being priuate men, & hauing no more assurance of the holie

Ghosts assistance then him-selfe,The curse of vncertainty among protestants. can be no more sure or infallible then the first, wherof it foloweth, that a protestant hath not, nor can haue any further certainty of the truth of his religion then humaine iudgement, or probabilitie can giue him (which is a miserable curse, and no fayth at all) except he wil flie to his inward spirit and inspiration, which is farre more vncertayne, and perilous then the other, all which is contrarie in the Catholyke Churche, and in the way and meanes of tryal which she foloweth, and consequentlie that the certayntie is farre different for securitie.
               
                   Furthermore the K. is sore vrged in this poynt of vncertaintie, about disagreeing not onlie from the old Catholyke doctors of the primitiue Church, but also from his owne the new, yea those that first brought this later light of his religion (yf it were light) into the world, as Luther, zwinglius, Caluyn, and such others, and he is demanded how he can dissent from the

               From this curse of varietie and vncertaintie of doctryne and beliefe, the warder passeth to an other no lesse markable brought in by change of old religion, which is, dissolution of lyfe and manners, which protestants them-selues do not deny in their writings

as before hath byn shewed,The curse of euel lyfe. Sup. cap 6. and yf they would, the experience of England it selfe is sufficient for proofe, and the warder declareth it by playne demonstration wherunto notwithstanding it seemed good to the K. to answere with deepe silence, not so much as mutt

               Then foloweth in the ward-word another  treatise of temporal effectes by change of religion, which he reduceth also to two heads. First what was liklie to haue fallen out, if this change of religion had not bene made in her Maties tyme, and then what hath ensued vpon the said change, and for the first he handleth eyght poyntes liklie to haue folowed. 1.

                     The summe of all that hath byn said about blessings, and cursings.First in spiritual affayres, to haue no certayntie of religion at all, as hath byn proued, no stay, no foundation, no final rule to try, or iudge to determin, but onlie euery mās owne priuate head, and fancie, wrangling and iangling without end, for that it is without iudge or meanes to make an end: nouelties without number, libertie of lyfe without feare, or force of ecclesiastical discipline to restrayne it. And then in tēporal matters the blessings are such as haue byn discouered, our realme deuided & shiuered in a thousand peeces; our Princesse in yeares without children, or hope of any, our crowne without succession, our old frends & allies made our enemyes, our new frends vncertayne; our owne flesh and countrymen most pittifullie deuided within their owne bowels, and most miserably tossed, and tormoyled

both abroad and at home, abroad and in other coūtryes, with prisons, yrōs, chaynes, gallyes, and other afflictions, euen to death it selfe; for being protestants, pyrates, spyes, practisers, or other such imputations incident to enemyes. At home afflicted with no lesse persecutions of our owne Magistrats, for being Catholikes, or deemed to be such. So as I would fayne know, who they are in our litle Iland, that feele these innumerable benefits & blessings by change of religion, which this gentleman talketh of, seing there are verie fewe eyther of one religion or other, that tast not of the miseries, wherof I haue spoken, eyther in themselues, their frends, children, seruants, kynsfolkes, goods honors, or otherwise, and most of al the realme and commō wealth it selfe, &c.

Tertullian expresly testifieth, and besydes this it comprehended many things more in particular, as explication of diuers hydden mysteries with direction how to vnderstand scriptures, as is playne by S. Paul before alleadged where he would haue prophesying or exposition of Scriptures to be according to the anologie & proportiō of this rule of fayth, to wit, that no exposition should be made according to the priuate spirit of any man, but according to that fayth and beliefe which before was generally receyued,2. Pet. 1. as S. Peter expresly aduiseth vs, wherby it came to passe as sayth Epiphanius, that no heretyke could euer put vp his head, and begin any thing against this rule, but that presentlie by the force therof he was discouered, and discomfyted, euen as now O.E. in this place as yow see goeth about to reiect Puritanes, and exclude them from his societie, for that they dissent from his particular new rule established by a fewe in the Churche & Parliament of Englād, & this rule of his made but yesterday, and by a fewe, and not yet throughly agreed vpon among themselues is thought of such force as it can exclude & reiect so many learned of their owne syde, how much more, the ancient rule made by the Apostles, and continued euer since by

all the Catholyke world is sufficient to condemne all new sectaries of our tyme that dare iangle against it.
               And this might be sufficient for declaration  of this rule, the antiquitie, force & vse therof, but that I can not wel omit a peece of one example out of old Tertulian aboue 14. hundred yeares agone, who after the words before cyted, where he sayth this rule is the fulnesse of the Apostles preaching (and note that he sayth preaching and not wryring) come downe in the Churche by dissent and tradition, he not onlie teacheth but vseth also the same rule & the eminent force therof against all heretikes of his tyme, who (as ours do now) pretended that this rule & corpes of fayth deliuered by the Apostles might perchance be corrupted, altered, misunderstood, or changed by their successors, and that the later Churches were not so pure, as the former, and consequentlie this rule so much vrged of tradition, and vniuersal cōsent might not be infallible, to which absurditie after many other reasons & reprehensiōs, Tertulian sayth as foloweth;Tertul lib. de p

Ed c. 1.2. & 11. & an. 2. & 3. cap. 1.21.23. though but 9. yeares old, there was two or three new rules made and altered about matters of religion and their communion book, all pretended out of the word of God, with reuocation of that which K. Henry the Father and his Parlaments, out of the same woord had appoynted before which rule also vnder K. Edward. I do not know

whether our Protestāts wil allow in all poyntes now, but sure I am our Puritanes do not, nor wil not, as appeareth by theire owne bookes; what assurance then is there in this mutable and controuerted rule of so fewe yeares in age?
               
                   But the most important question is, who and what men, and by what authoritie they made this rule? The Warder knew no other when he writ, but the Lords of the Parlamēt, and so called it parlament religion wherwith O. E. is very angry,Pag. 19. and sayth where he calleth our religion parlament religion, he speaketh like himselfe, that is falsly and slaunderously, for albeit the same be receyued by authoritie of the Prince & state, yet is it Christs re

                     io principij, hissed out by learned men, which consisteth in setting downe that for a principle, which most needeth proof, as heere where our minister wil needs haue his religion to be Christs religion, whether we wil or no, and that it was but receyued and promulgated only by the parlament, but then must I aske him agayne, what authoritie besydes the parlament hath determyned it to be Christs religion? as also that the Puritans religion is not Christs religion, notwithstanding they pretend Christ, and his Apostles no lesse then doth the protestant? and then if we fynd that the only authoritie that defyneth this matter is the Parlament allowing

the one and condemning the other, for that scriptures of themselues can not do it (quia actiones sunt suppositorum, as a litle after he vrgeth) and then must needs the credit & truth of English religion depend of the parlament, and therof, worthelie be called Parlament religion.
               But harken (good reader) what an example  he hath found to auoyd,An example making against himself. that his religion may not be called Parlament religion. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theod

Yes surelie Syr Noddy-maker, I would cal and proue it so if the case were like, that is, if these three Emperors had determined this fayth as of thēselues, and by their imperial authoritie, and that it had byn a different beliefe from the rule of fayth receyued before, throughout Christendome, as your parlament religiō was and is, hauing no other ecclesiastical Authoritie

                  mitted in alleaging this one example of these Emperors, and on whom they light, but the principal is, that being alleaged by himself, and for himself, it maketh wholie against him, & ouerthroweth quite his cause which may be accōpted doltisme also in the deane, besydes Nodytisme: for it sheweth first the whole difference betweene these Catholike Emperors decree,Poynts of the Emp. decree contrary to O. E. for defence of religion, and the modernal decrees of our Parlaments that take vpon them to appoynte and defyne religion in England, it sheweth that the Romane religion was receyued by S. Peter, and had endured so vntil their dayes, which was more then 400. yeares, it sheweth also that Damasus Pope of Rome was then the cheife gouernor of christian religion throughout the world: it sheweth that these Emperours accounted him for their head, and not he them in matters of religion, it sheweth how humbly these Emperors did submit themselues to the decree of the councel of Nice made before their dayes about three persons in one God-head, confirmed by Pope Siluester, and continued by Damasus; and it sheweth how obedientlie and christianly these Emperors did hold them for Catholike christiās, whom thesaid councel, and Pope Damasus did hold for Catholiks and condemned those for infamous heretikes, who did dissent from their

obedience in religion; and now whether our later Parlaments of England haue done the same by the councel of Trent, and Popes confirming & defending the same (as our former parlaments were wont to doe) I leaue to the reader to iudge, and whether this law of these Emperors were wyselie brought in by O. E. or no; but let vs passe yet further in examyning this rule for tryal of truth.
               The minister hauing shifted of wittilie (as  it seemeth to him) the exprobration of parlament religion by the foresaid example of the Emperors, falleth to range, and roue wyde & far, and to obiect to vs that in Q. maryes dayes our religion was established more by parlament,
then by authoritie of the Apostles, that we are deuided among our selues, and haue more then 200. diuers opinions about the Sacrament of the L. supper, that the vniuersal Churche could not deliuer vs our fayth,Diuers manifest false obiections.

                     tus, when he sayth:

                  Terminus singularis collectiuus est, qui tantum plura coniunctè significat, which signifieth the comprehension of many in it self, as Rome, London parlament, cittye, churche, congregation, and the like, which according to logique are properlie particuler indiuiduals, and not vniuersals, though they conteyne ech of them a multitude in them, and in that sense may be called vniuersals, as the whole and vniuersal city parlament, common wealth &c. and they haue this nature that the actions of particulars conteyned in them, and authorized by the whole, do stand for the whole, and are said to be of the whole as the acts of Parlament in England, though they be done be particular men (and often tymes not by all) yet are they not called the actes of particular men, but of the whole parlament and the like of the actes of the cittie, or common wealth.
               
                   And further when such an act is deliuered to me by a particular man not in his owne name,Actes of particular men attributed to the vvhole body. nor as his owne acte or decree, but as the act of the Parlament and in name therof, I may wel say that the Parlament deliuereth me the same, which I may also say when the cittie of London, the chācerie, the kings bench the court of wardes, or other cōmon bodyes maketh out any order though it be deliuered by particuler mē, yet is it the act of the whole vniuersal body, and so called and accounted, and not of the particuler men, that deliuer or execute the same, which being vnderstood let vs now come co the application of our particuler

case of the vniuersal Churche her teaching, and therby discouer the deep lurking of our souldiour-masked minister.
               When we Catholykes say that our fayth is  taught,The application of the former discourse. or deliuered vnto vs by the vniuersal Churche, our meanings, that albeit particular men as Priests, Pastors, or preachers do immediatly deliuer the same vnto vs, yet for that they do yt not as of them-selues, nor as their owne, but from the said Catholyke vniuersal Churche, and by her order, we say truly and properlie, and cannot say otherwyse, but that we are taught it by thesaid vniuersal Churche, which is the body, and not by perticuler men which are parts only, euen as when a man striketh an other with his foot or hand, it cannot be said so properly that the foot or hand strook him, as the man him-self, and this argumēt, rūnneth also in our aduersaries cause, yf he had wit to see it, for when a mā is taught at this day the protestant fayth of England allowed by the state, may he not say more truly and properly that it is the teaching of the vniuersal Churche of England, then of this or that particuler contemptible minister? but this he foresaw not, when he came in with his actionis sunt suppositorum, & therby wil see what reason I had to ad stultorum, for so much as his obiection besydes the ignorance, and falshood therof, ouerthroweth no lesse him-selfe, and the teaching of his Church,Ignorance of O.E. yf it had any force & so much of this which indeed is ouer much for the fondnes of the instance.
               
                  
                   There remayneth then that part only of his babble where he cryeth out, that our religion is not Catholike, but his, and that ours is buylded only vpon Popes which are mutable and subiect to error & his vpon the eternal truth of God, &c. All which to yes though they haue byn sufficiently refuted before, in that I haue alleaged, and a thousand tymes before that agayne by other writers, yet these men as hungry flyes beaten of from hunny do returne stil with the very same clamors agayne, for lack of other better matter, and heere yow see are two poynts the first, whether we or they be Catholikes, and then whether we depend of Popes, and they of God.
               
               
                   For the first which of our Churches is truly Catholike much hath byn said (or at leastwyse may be gathered) by the former discourse about the ancient rule of true Catholike fayth,VVho are Catholykes. but more particularly it remayneth to be handled in this fellowes first new foolish chalenge added after this for Syr F. wherfore heere I wil say no more of that mad paradox for which shame ynough abydeth O.E. in that, when I shal come to answere it.
               
                   Now for the second about our depending of Popes and they of God, and the scriptures, it hath appeared by the two or three precedēt chapters, how they depend ech man of their owne fancy and iudgment of scripture, and not of God, or godlines, and as for our depending of Popes as heads successiuely of our Churche, we confesse it willingly, and do glory therin, that we are not heretical acheu

                  earned, rude, feeble or infirme (as hardly can be chosen one meaner then himselfe was in all or most of these poynts (before he receyued vertue from his maister) yet shal his learning be incontrolable for gouernment of Gods Churche, taking that helpe by councels doctors & other learned meanes, which he may, (and Gods prouidence wil euer prouide that he shal do) his rudenes also shalbe wysedome, his feeblenes fortitude, his infirmity vertue, in respect of his place and dignity, and this did our ancient holy Fathers esteeme the matter, not by the talents or merit of the man as heretikes bable but by his office, place, and dignitie.
               As for example who knoweth not but that  Pope Damasus before mentioned in the decree of the three Emperors was not perhaps the learnedest man in the world, nor otherwise the best qualifyed for humayne giftes (though he were also a notable man) but other

might exceed him in these poynts. Yet do the said Emperors preferre him before all in directing men for their fayth and beleefe, as yow haue heard; S. Hierome also was farre more learned then he by studdy, as all men wil confesse, and himselfe also, for that he wrote often to S. Hierome to requyre his opinion in poyntes of learning, and yet when the matter came to determyne poyntes of fayth S. Hierome subiecteth himselfe to him, with that humility, as a chyld and scholler would vnto his father and Maister, and much more, for that he saith most absolutely in a most hard and perilous controuersie of that tyme not yet determined; to wit, whether one or three hypostacies, or subsistēces were to beholden in the Trinitie,The faith & humilitie of saynst Hier. epist. ad Damas. the most learned humble father I say writeth thus to Pope Damasus out of Syria, Obtestor Beatitudinē tuam vt mihi Epistolis tuis siue dicendarum siue tacendarum hypostas

                   Loe heere the different spirit in a learned humble Catholike saynct, from an ignorant prowd contemptuous heretike, S. Hierome regardeth not the personal partes of Pope Damasus, but his place, roome, and dignity of his office: our heretikes not only do contemne his place, but also most maliciouslie do lode the persons of al or most Popes with infinite calumniations and slaunders, therby to

discredit their office and ordinances, what then may we say of these men but that they are gyuen ouer as S. Paul sayth in reprobum sensum to a reprobate sense, and synne maliciouslie, and desperately to rayle against their owne consciences, God amēd them, and let all wyse men take heed of them.
               As for the last and lowdest
                     •
                   ly, which this  prating minister affirmeth,VVhether Catholyke religion be ful of nouelties and heresies. to wit, that Catholike religion is ful of new noueltyes, and old heresyes, this also is to be discussed in his foresaid chalenge when it commeth to be aunswered, wherunto I might remit the matter, without saying any thing here, as I meane to do, but only to premonish the reader of two poynts, that there I am to handle, the first, that if this woodcock or any of his crew can shew any one noueltie (as an article of fayth in our religion which was not beleeued in the Apostles tyme, and in all ages since by the professors of the Catholike fayth, eyther explicite or implicite (as diuines terme it) we shal yeild in all the rest, for that we hold the foresaid rule of fayth deliuered by the Apostles to haue byn ful and perfect, and that whatsoeuer poynt of fayth hath byn determined of since, by general councels, confirmed by Popes, hath byn no new thing, but explication only of that which was before deliuered by the Apostles, albeit not so expreslie knowne to all.
               In the second poynt also we hold that if O.E. or his mates, can shewe any one heresie,

taken for an heresie by the general Churche since Christs tyme vnto Luthers, or after, to be holden by vs truely, and in the same sense wherin it was condemned for an heresy, and holden by those heretykes: if this I say can be truly shewed and not as this vice cometh in with fustian-apes for veluet telling vs a tale of the Coli

                     ridians that offred Sacrifice to the Virgin Mary, and other like, from whom he cannot deny, but that we differ most manifestly (though his forehead be neuer so hard) If this I say can be prooued, that any one heresy is truely among vs and not the similitude only or shadow therof, then wil we aske no further proof of any thing against vs, for that we hold absolutely that eyther all or none is trew in our religion: but on the contrary syde, we shal shewe, and demonstrate most clearely, that they hold many old condemned heresies, in the self same sense, wordes, and meaning, wherin they were condemned by the vniuersal Churche, & held by those heretikes. And this is the true difference betweene vs and them, to wit, that they obiect to vs shadowes, and resemblances of heresyes, but we conuince them of true heresy in deed.
            
            
               
               IT IS FVRTHER shewed by diuers cleare examples, that O. E. and his fellowes do playnly dispayre of all certayne meane or rule to try the truth among them-selues, or with vs. CAP. XVII.
               NOtwithstanding that sufficient hath byn  said before in diuers chapters of this first encounter to shew that Protestants haue no sure rule or certayne meanes at all for agreement in matters of Religion,Sup. cap 3.4. 5.15 16. or for consent, or assurance therin, yet for so much as this is a most principal poynt to be wel vnderstood, & deeply pondered by euery man that loueth his eternal lyfe, and saluation, I haue thought good to treat one poynt more in this chapter, which is the confession of our aduersaries them-selues in this behalfe, though not in playne words, yet in manifest deedes which are not nor ought to be of lesse authoritie then wordes.
               And first of all I wil shewe this by their passing ouer without answere this whole matter (being the most principal of all this first encounter) when the warder vrgeth them most earnestlie in the poynt it selfe, and both of them (I meane both the Kt. first, & the minister after him do answere directlie no one woord vnto the whole demonstration, which is a playne confession that they cannot answere

it, but yet to shewe it more euidently, and to conuince them in this place, I wil repeate agayne what the warder said before.
               
                  
                  I would aske S. F. (sayth he) or any such man as he is,Pag. 4. that determineth so resolutely that his only religion among so many others (as are extant at this day) is true, and all others false; wheron doth he ground his certaintie?
               
               
                  
                     Tvvo vvayes of tryal proposed.Two onely meanes can S. F. haue to guyde himselfe in this case, first that he hath receaued this doctrine of such or such persons, preachers, ministers, or doctors, whose learning and knowledge in this behalfe he trusteth absolutely: and then is his whole fayth buylded vpon the credit of man, as is euident, and consequently is nothing worth, nor no fayth at all. The other way is, that he beleeueth it, for that it is founded in Scripture; but this way to S. F. must needs be as vncertayne as the other, yf not more, for that to be sure, that it is soundly groūded vpon Scripture, he must first read himselfe his whole beleefe expresly in Scriptures, which is much for a man of S.F. occupation to do, and then he must be able to iudge of many other poyntes, belonging to the same, as namely that the book is surely Scr

                        •
                     n: And lastly, he must be sure of the true sense and exposition, which also are hard matters for a man of S. F. learning, and much more for others that know lesse then he.
               
               
                  
                  Yea and when all is done, yf he had all these helpes needful for such a matter (as he hath not) yet were it but a priuate mānes opiniō, & consequently his fayth should be grounded, but vpon his owne particuler iudgmēt, which maketh no fayth at all, but opinion only as often hath byn sayd, for that fayth must haue Gods expresse authoritie for her foundation.
               
               
                  So that to conclude, the first blessing which  S. F. in particular thinketh to haue receaued by this change of his religion, is in effect, that whereas before when he beleeued the Catholyke and vniuersal fayth of Christendome, deliuered vnto him by the vniuersal Churche, as founded on Scripture (which Churche Christ & his Apostles gaue him expresse commission to credit) his beleef was properly fayth, & founded vpon a rock, that could not fayle: now hauing left that fortresse, & cast him-self into the waues of new opinions, he hath nothing certayne at all but so much as he list to chose of him-self, or of other mennes opinions, which choise is properly called heresie, for that the word heresy in Greek (as all learned men know) signifieth nothing els, but a certayne election, and choise in matters of Religion, to wit, when a man leauing the commō cōsent of the general Churche

                     temne) but rather of his owne Doctors, Martyn Luther, Iohn Caluin, Theodore B

F. yet why should he beleeue his owne iudgement more then theirs in pointes of fayth? wherin they differ from him, as Luther about the real presence, and the number, and forme of Sacraments, and many other points, Caluyn in matter of the Queenes Supremacy which he denyeth. Beza in the whole gouernment of their Churche. Or why should I beleeue S. F. or his new masters of Englād, rather thē these that were more learned then he or his? or what reason, rule, or foundation, haue any of these men to beleeue their owne opinion, more then others, but only self wil and fancy?
               
               
                  
                      This then is the first and greatest spiritual benediction (or malediction rather) that I fynd to haue happened to our realme, and nation by this wooful alteration of religion, that wheras before we had a direct rule, squyre & pole-starre to follow, which was the vniuersal Churche, now euery man being set at liberty, holdeth, beleeueth, and teacheth what he listeth. Nor is there any way or meane left to restrayne him, for straight way he appealeth bodlie and confidentlie to the Scriptures,

               And the very same cause that moued the  Warder to be so liberal then in setting downe this poynt, hath moued me now to repeat the same againe in this place.
               And what do yow think that the knight & his champion haue replyed to all this playne and manifest demonstration? would not yow think that both of them for their credits sake should haue buckled vp them-selues to ioyne in this yssue with the warder, shewing what certainty they haue, or which of the two wayes they wil take proposed by him, seeing he sayth there are no other, or that they should thē-selues at least appoynt some other way: but consider good reader the force of euident truth they are so blanked, and their mouthes so shut vp with this interrogation of the warder, as the Kt. thought it best to passe it wholie ouer with silence, as before hath byn touched: The minister with more shame then the Kt. hath tatled somwhat,Idle tatling in a grau

                   teacheth that the Churche hath power to proue, taxe, and consigne the

books of holy Scripture. And that vniuersal tradition is the most certayne interpreter therof. And finally that the fayth of Papists is buylt vpon the Popes fancie and opinion, and it is ful of nouelties, and old heresies, and the like, as before yow haue heard.
               
                   All these tatlings he hath vpon this discourse before rehearsed of the warder, and almost in as many words as I haue recyted thē: but to the matter it selfe about certainty or vncertainty in religion ne griquidem: he answereth no one word at all, only to the later parte, or appendix of the discourse where the warder sayth that to make the matter more playne, how protestants haue no other rule of beleef, he asketh S. F. not of any Catholyke Doctors, nor auncient Fathers, whome he esteemeth not, but of their owne new Doctors Luther, Caluyn, Beza, and the like authors of their owne sects, why English Protestants at this day should preferre their owne iudgments before these also, (whom they grāt to haue had great store of the holy ghost) in all matters, doctrines, and interpretation of Scripture, where they dissent from them.
               
                   To this I say (all the other storme being past) it seemed good to the minister to make his answere in these wordes.
               
                  But sayth this Noddy: why should yow beleeue more your owne opinions then Caluyn concerning the Q. supremacy, Luther concerning the Real presence, and Beza in the Churche gouernment? I answere, first that these mennes priuate opinions concerne not fundamental

poynts of fayth;
                  Pag. 21. A most foolish ansvvere of O. E. about Luther Caluyn &c. 
                  and therfore they are not to be brought foorth for instance in this cause where we talk of the foundations and reasons of Christian fayth. Marke wel his answere (good reader) & iudge who is the noddy, he sayth two things: the one, that the iudgments of Luther Caluin, and Beza be but priuate opinions among them; the other that the poynts wherin they differ from them to wit, the real presence in the Sacrament, her Maties. Supremacy ecclesiastical, and the whole gouernemēt of the Churche are no fundamental poynts of their faith.
               For the first I would gladly know what authority  is auayleable among them in teaching, preaching, and interpretation of Scriptures, yf Luther, Caluyn, and Beza be reiected as priuate and particuler men, where they differ from them? our Doctors and Churche they do defy, the ancient Fathers they look not willingly after them, their owne parlament this mā sayth a litle before doth not appoynt but admit their religiō only, who then is hee, or who are they that must determine, and defyne in this case? For the second, yf the difference with Luther about the real presence of Christs real body in the Sacrament, be no fundamental poynt of fayth (seing they accuse vs of the highest cryme vnder heauen about the same, that is, of idolatry, and holding a creature to be the creator, and we them againe of most heynous blasphemy & highest wickednes vpon earth in discrediting Christ in his owne words, that said it was his bodie, &

his whole Church that euer so vnderstood him vnto this day) yf the matter of supremacy be no fundamental poynt of fayth,VVhat pointes are fundamental in protestants doctryne. wherby all their ecclesiastical hierarchie standeth at this day in England as their Bishops Deanes, Archdeacons, and other prelates, and parsons of the Spiritualty, who otherwise must needs be playne intruders, and meere lay men.
               If their whole gouernmēt of their Churche be not fundamental wherof dependeth whether they haue any true ministers, preachers and teachers lawfully allowed or no & consequentlie whether their Sacraments be Sacraments and be administred by them that haue authoritie so to doe; if all these poynts I say be not fundamental in O.E. opinion, what are fundamental? And what Atheisme doth this Martial minister & diuels deane bring in vpon vs? But beleeue me (good reader) these good fellowes do only eate of the ministerie, and beleeue as please them; and this being a compagnion of many occupations, wil liue by that which wil yeild him most, & according to that also shal be his doctrine and beleef.

               Loe his saying: and albeit he say madlie, yet I trust he wil not say but that in one and the selfe same Churche agreeing all in one true doctryne of Iesus Christ (as in the former leafe he affirmeth all sortes of protestants do) it is necessarie they agree in the substantial poynts at least of some gouernement among them-selues,Pag. 18. as for example,Atheistical Doctrine O.E. of some one head & the cheife members therof, as whether the Prince be supreeme head ecclesiastical, and

may make Bishops, and whether the Bishops be true Prelates, and may make ministers, and whether they be of Gods or the diuels making that are so made, which is the proper controuersie betweene them of England, and Beza at this day, and was with Iohn Caluyn also while he lyued. To deny this I say, were a very mad new doctrine for souldiour O.E. to teach now vnder a ministers coate, to wit, that none of all these things are necessarie poynts of doctrine, but indifferent rather, and that in his Churche a minister, & a ministrel, a preacher, and a pyrate, a bishop and a bytesheep, a deane, and a diuel are all one.

meaning therof, wher-vpon considering the great inconuenience and hurt that of this doth ensue, he hath thought vpon another meane of agreement, which is to make sute vnto the States to grant them leaue in some field or towne to assemble themselues seuerally, and to pray to God, first the one syde, and then the other, to obtayne some euident myracle for decision of their controuersies, and to know which syde should yeild to the other.

               Heere (loe) is this mannes opinion for the meane to try out truth among them after lōg proof that Scripture alone wil not do it, yf O. E. and his compagnions wil accept of his offer to go and pray with them in the feilds of Holland to stay the Sunne, they may chance to agree together at the next new moone, to whose wanes and changements I leaue both them and the progresse of their religion, and meane only to say a

fewe words more about the fruits of good works and temporal benedictions, and so to end this first encounter, wherin I haue byn ouer long already.

                   THow wilt not forget (good reader) I hope how in the tenth chapter of this Encounter we examined the fourth blessing of the new ghospel assigned by S.F. to be good lyfe,En. 1. cap. 10. and holy woorks of Protestants aboue other men (for otherwise it could be no special blessing of their ghospel) where I shewed first that seing this blessing was testified only by them-selues, & not by their neighbours that liued with them, and ought to feele the effect
                     •
                   of this blessing, it was vayne and rather to be esteemed a brag then a blessing, which I confirmed, for that the warder comming to th

discerned, whether protestants, or Catholykes abound more in them, the Kt. slippeth a syde, and letteth passe the whole declaration of the warder without so much as a beck or nod at it, for which respect I haue thought conueniēt to repeat thesame agayne in this place in the Warders owne words (for that they are not many) and to see at least what the Aduocate minister supplyeth for his Cliēt the Kt. in this behalf, thus then wrote the warder.
               
                  After assurance, stabilitie, and vnion in beleef, the next greatest spiritual benedictions that can be expected of any doctrine,Pag. 6. VVhat effectes of vertue nevv religion hath vvrought. are the good effects of vertue which it worketh in mennes mynds & manners, as it was foretold by Esay the Prophet, that Christs doctrine, should so alter mens conditions and natures, that such as were most fearce, sauadge, and wicked before should by this doctrine become most humble,Esa 11. kynd and gentle. The wolfe (sayth he) shal dwel with the lambe, and the parde shal lye with the goate, the calfe, lyon, and sheep shal abyde together: and a litle chyld shal be able to gouerne them all.

                      But let vs see other effects, Christs doctrine exhorteth to penance, to mortification of the flesh, to continency, virginity, fasting, praying, almes voluntarie pouerty, renouncing of the world, and the lyke. Are there more of these effects now adayes in England, or before? or are their more in Syr. F. and his men, then in ours? doth he and his ghospellers pay their debts better then Catholykes doe, or keep better houses, or more hospitalitie, or rayse their rents lesse, or take lesse fynes, or vse their tenants better, or lend their neighbours more money without vsurie? or do they help to marrie more poore mennes daughters, and other such lyke good works of charitie?

Let S. F. answere me to this, and not he only but the whole country round about him, and then let him tel me with witnesses, whether they be spiritual blessings or curses that haue ensued vpon this change of religion, so much commended by him, and so I shal passe to weigh his temporal benedictions, which perhaps he esteemeth farre more thē these spiritual.
                  
Thus he.
               
                  To all this treatie of the fruits of vertue, &  vertuous lyfe in Protestants, S. F. answereth not so much as one lyne, and therfore his prating Proctor to helpe out his maister must needs bestyrre him-selfe to say som-what, but how fit to the purpose, and state of the question his owne words shal shew, for thus he beginneth.Pag. 23. 
                  I answere (sayth he) that the doctrine of the ghospel hath wrought good effect in all true Christians, and albeit euery one do not so square their liues according to Gods lawe, as they should, yet compart our people with the Papists, nay with the Priests, and Popes them-selues, whom they call most holy,
                  For his office and not for his person. 
                  I make no question but they do sarre excel them.
               
               Loe heere this fellow is quick, and resolute, he maketh no question of that which is most in question, or rather which is all the question, whether protestants in all countryes where they lyue be of better lyues generally then Catholykes, or that which is the same in effect, (but yet more easie to be discerned,) whether the world since the rising of Luther and Caluins new doctrine (which this man calleth the ghospel,Sup. cap 17. nu. 10. though before he haue cō
                  demned the same in diuers poyntes as yow haue heard) the manners of men haue byn generally better or worse, for that according to the warders discours

                     •
                  on, and reformation, bringeth euer with it better lyfe, and behauiour of men, this then is the true state of the question whether protestants religion haue done this or no, wherof we haue shewed the negatiue part

before out of their owne wryters, and the meanest man, woman, or chyld that lyueth at this day, yf they haue heard of things past, or can behold matters present with any iudgement, wil easely discerne. Yet this resolute Minister, (as yow see,) maketh no question to the contrarie, and so from this general assertion passeth on to prayse exceedinglie the clemencie, and vertue of protestant Princes, and then turneth he to the contrarie (which is his only plausible common place to dilate, and delight him-selfe) I meane against Rome and her Popes: But the whorish synagoge (sayth he) of Rome yow must not maruaile of the speech (for that whores and knaues in his ministerie do oftē meet) shee is red with the blood of saincts, no tyger was euer more fearce and cruel.
               
               
                   Thus in general, and then layeth he load vpon Popes, Card. Priests, monasteries, both of men and women, and for proof therof bringeth out Boccas an old bawdy Italian Poet, & Pallengenius an other, as lasciuious in heresie, as the other in Lecherie, and besyds this he citeth also a worke without an author called Onus Ecclesiae wherin many abuses in lyfe and māners by way of compassiō are complayned on with desyre of amendment, and with this doth the minister think that he hath played the man, and proued sufficientlie that the new ghospel hath brought in great reformation of lyfe, and manners, and that now the world goeth better then before, for good works: wherin (as I said) the best iudge may be the

common sense, feeling, and experience of men that lyue in the world, for that descending to particulers, in so long a circuit as is the world, is both infinite, vncertayne and odious; yet yf I would follow this fowle mouthed minister in ripping vp vnsauery matters, of his cleargie as he fayneth, & amplifyeth of ours I might go but to publike recordes of his men punished by publike iustice for their outragious behauiour in that behalfe, I meane in that very point of carnalitie, which they most obiect to ours in most false manner, and for auoyding wherof in them-selues each one of them haue allowed his remedy most desyred, called by them-selues his vessel of ease, though with no smal disease and disaster of the common wealth as before hath byn shewed.
               But to leaue this poynt, and to come to the  second which is about the temporal respects, whether the new ghospel and change of old religion haue brought losse or gayne hurtes or benefits, conueniēces or inconueniences in this behalfe, the matter is not much more doubtful then in the former conference of good lyfe and works. For albeyt both the Kt. and his procter do put downe certayne temporal benefits as blessings receyued by their new ghospel, yet are they both light & vayne in them-selues and not agreeing betwene them-selues, neyther do they satisfie or answere the great hurts and inconueniences set downe on the contrary side by the warder towards the end of this his first encounter,

which being very weighty and of great consideratiō the Kt. leapeth ouer thē altogeather, as before hath byn signified, but the minister chattereth here and there after his fashon, but far from answering any substantial point therof, which thing to the end yow may the better perceyue, I shal take payne to repeat againe in this place the former hurts receyued by chāge of religion mētioned by the warder in these words.
               
                  
                      For better vnderstanding of the controuersy in question,Pag. 7. and 8. men are wont to bring into consideration two poynts.Temporal effects by change of religion.
First what is likely to haue byn or fallen out yf the change of religion had not byn made in her Maties. tyme, and then what hath insued vpon the change made. To the first they say that if as her Matie. entred most happily and ioyfully into the crowne of England by general consent of all and promoted especially by the peculiar forces of Catholyks that were at that day most potent without comparison, and that as her Matie. entred Catholikely that is to say shewing her selfe in all points of religion and behau

                     o yeld ther-vnto at the beginning,

for that she foresaw by her wisdome, diuers of the inconueniences that sithēce haue ensued,) then say these men yf this had byn so, both her Matie. and the realme had byn most happy at this day, and in particular they alleadge these benefits following, which of all probability would haue fallen vpon vs.
               
               This is the Warders profer in this behalf, and then do ensue,The vaine chatte

                     ng of O.E. 8. special considerations of moment to be wayed in this affayre, which after we shal lay forth and examine in order. But now to consider the chattering of our parrat minister for denial of all these things, I can noe wayes make yow better apprehend yt then to tel yow of a certayne commedy which once I saw in Venice (yf wel I remēber) wherin the Vice of the play had taken for his inuention to contradict euery thing that his fellow should say, and so when the one said good morrow to the people, the other said good euen, when one said it was a fayre day, the other it was a foule when the one said it was noone, the other answered it was night, when the one affirmed that the Sunne shyned cleerly the other would needs hold that it was the moone, and so he passed forward in contradicting all that the other affirmed, vntil the people being wearyed, cryed out that the foole should be thrust downe for he marred the play.
               And this is our case now O.E. is set vpon a new deuise to drop denials with his aduersary, and to contradict whatsoeuer he saith, or howsoeuer: yow haue hard what the warder

hath wrytten in this his preface, harken then how this fellow cōtradicteth and with what, and how good reasons.
               The Warder saith that her Matie. 
                  entred most happily and ioyfully to the crowne of England by general consent of all.
                  A comparison of a vice in a play The minister saith it was not so, for that it greeued the Papists exceedingly. The other said: she was promoted especially by the peculiar forces of Catholyks that were at that day most potent without comparison,
                  Pag 2
                        •
                     . this man denyeth it & giueth this goodly reason: what needed force if all were willing she should be crowned. The other saith further that her Matie. 
                  entred Catholikly, shewing her selfe in all points a Catholyke. This fellow denyeth yt with this reason: For if she had so done, why should the popish prelats feare any alteration. The Warder furthermore saith: she was crowned and annoynted Catholikely by a Catholyke Bishop, at a Cath. masse. O. E. denyeth all, and sayth: she declared plainly, she would not masse: which how loud a ly yt is, not only her Matie. can testifie, but as many as yet liue, and were present at that act, and him-selfe presently touched (as yt were) with some shame of this asseueration, addeth: But were yt true, yet his coniecture of happines is vayne, &c. Whervnto I answere, that yf it were true, then was O.E. false in denying yt: and as for the vanity of the coniecture: that yf masse and old religion, had byn continued in England, many inconueniences had byn auoyded, we shal try the matters in the particulars that doe ensue, but in the meane space, consider the vanity of

this vice for bringing in for instance to the contrary Francis, Charles, & Henry Kings of Frāce, the States of the low countreys & the people of Portugal, who haue fallen into diuers troubles, warres and disasters not-withstanding they contynued the masse and were Catholyks in religion. But I would aske O. E. whether these troubles came by their chaūge of religion or noe? For yf they did not, then are they impertinent to our purpose, which is to shew that by change of religion commonly do ensue troubles, but not that only by this meanes disasters are incurred, as though there were no other, for that Catholyke Princes & people also may incurre troubles by other meanes, then by change of religion, but they auoyd those which this change doth bring with yt.Change of religion in France and Flanders. Wherfore this noddy is discouered to speake nothing to the purpose in bringing in those fiue examples wherof foure not-withstanding are wholy against him-selfe, for that all the troubles which he mentioneth to haue happened to Catholyke Princes and people in France and Flaunders haue byn occasioned by change of religion inforced vpon them by others, as the world knoweth, and not by

To the other point mentioned by the Warder of the late peace made in Fraunce betweene those Monarches by the Popes mediation, the minister saith nothing for that came not to his purpose, yet he telleth vs againe heere now, that Henry the third late K. of France and the late Duke of Ferrara and other Princes of the Popes religion, were not-with-standing that, troubled by the Pope. A wise argument, as though there were noe other cause for which the Pope might fal out, with any Prince, or punish him, but only for chaūge of religion.

And albeit future ages wilbe more indifferent iudges in this matter, as more free from passion therin, yet to vnderstand better the state of the question, I would aske of this wyse statesman & lawyer, (as he maketh him-selfe) who both heere and euery where els calleth me noddy, whether yt be lawful to all s

the treasons so made be true, and properly treasons, and the offenders rightly to be called traytors? And when he hath answered me this,VVhether our Priests be traytors or martyrs. and I shal haue prooued to him out of their owne wryters and chroniclers (as I can) and by their owne publyke records, that this is the state of our question with them, & that many or most of our Priests haue byn executed only for those articles of treason that were so made; then wil yt be easy to iudge and discerne what kynd of traytors they are, who for those transgressions haue byn put to death and executed. Then wil all this vayne fellowes babling out of books of imperial and comon lawes about treasons of other kynds be quite cut of, and proued childish and to no purpose.
               Wherfore to draw at length to an end of  this Encounter, I doubt not (good Readers) but thow doest see by thy wisdome, how not-with-standing the double reply made by the K•. and minister the warders discourse about these blessings and curssings remayneth yet whole and firme. And albeit the minister hath brought more words thē the Kt. yet no more substance but rather lesse, and both of them much fraud and folly, as in the admonition following in part shal appeare.

                   AND now for the conclusion of this Encounter I think is not amisse, to the end that this my answere and reioynder (which I call a Warn-word) may do his duty and performe so much as the name and title importeth, I am to bestow vpon the Kt. in this place a breife and frendly admonition or warning, wherby he may him-self (yf passion wil suffer him to see the truth) or others at least wayes that are more indifferent & lesse passionate in the cause then he, cōsider the difference of our manner of proceeding in this affayre, to wit, the plaine and round dealing on our side going directly to the matter, and the shifting and shufling, on his to auoyde due trial, and how that with no probability of reason or truth can he stand in the controuersy taken in hand of his blessings brought in by change of religiō, his defence wherof is so impertinent, false and from the matter, as before yow haue seene, yet for better memories sake, and for some aduertisment to the Kt. to look ouer his owne faults I shal breefly heere put him in. mynd of that which hath passed in this Encounter.
               
                  First the charge of notorious flattery in bragging  of so many blessings come to England by change of religion, seemeth to ly stil vpon him more heauy then before, for that he hath answered substantially to noe one argument of his aduersary to the contrary and the shift of passing ouer whole treateses and discourses of the warder (yea foure or fiue as is prooued) without any reply or mention,Cap. 1
                        •
                     . argueth great weaknes in his cause. The other shift also of excusing his flattery by the flattery of Canonists (yf it were true) is very vayne and ridiculous.
               The new ten deuised blessings are such &  so poore,Nevv deuised blessings. as noe man would haue brought them in but he that eyther for lack of iudgment, decerneth not, what is for him, nor what is against him, or whome necessity forceth to expose him-selfe to the laughter of all men. For who wil, not laught to see vnity brought in for a blessing among protestants that cold neuer yet agree in the poynts of their religion, nor euer wil, or can, and whose badge of dissension and disagreement is so notorious aboue all other heretyks before them?Vid. cap. 3.

                     . 5. & 6. Who wil not laugh also and bite his lip to see good woorks & abstayning from persecution assigned for two other peculiar blessings, considering what passeth in England and what in other countreys. I passe our the rest as false or foolish or both, vntil I come to the tenth, that is copious generation of children, which in respect of the marriage of their friars, monks

& ministers, we yeild vnto them, but deny it to be a blessing especially to those parishes, that by force are cōstrayned to maintayne their copious brood & of spring: & to this I cal to witnesse the Churche-wardens & parishioners.
               
                   This then is folly to bring in such sorts and sutes of blessings as euery chyld may see there vanity and laugh at them. But that which ensueth of frau

                  , fleights and deceyts is farre worse,Variety of shifts. which may be discouered by the variety of shifts noted in his whole discourse, as namely that which was last recyted of passing ouer and dissembling all his aduersaryes principal arguments, reasons, & allegations without mention at all, or els mentioning them only in a word or two without further answere; in lyke manner his not quoting places of books or chapters, of the authors which he cyteth when he wil deceaue, is a new trick neuer vsed perhaps before by any that hath written of controuersies, though the other of misalleadging, corrupting, peruerting & forcing them against their owne expresse meaning hath (I grant) byn vsed by diuers, and cheefly by the patrons and grandsyres of English protestancy,Vid. cap. 9. & 10.

I was tempted to take this sentence of S. Augustine from him and bestow yt vpon the minister, but in the end I resolued to leaue yt common to both, and to the end

yow may consider how fitly the foresaid sentence as wel of a shamelesse mynd as of a shamelesse forehead doth fal vpon the masked minister O. E. yow must remember how he hath behaued him-selfe in the former combat & how euen at his very first calling vpon the stage he shewed vs a notorious cosening trik about falsifying a place of S. Augustine,Vid. Cap. 3.

                  AS in the former first Encounter  the knight in his vaunt of vanitie,VVatchvvord and vanitie therof. & height of heretical pryde went about to persuade vs, yea to lay before our face the inestimable, and innumerable blessings which our country (for sooth) had receyued by change of Catholyke religion into Protestancie, so for better confirmation of

this so loftie a dryft he took vpon him in this second Encounter to make declaration that in Queene Maries raygne, and former tymes vnder Catholyke English Princes, there was uothing els but darkenesse, cloudes, mistes, shadowes, ignorance, blyndnes, want of learning, lack of light, and other such calamities, and miserable obscurities: for proof wherof he setteth downe as it were by way of preface or preparation to his designed treatise certayne preambles forged by him-self, as for example, that the only desyre to read vpon the book of God the old or new testament was held for heynous heresie in former tymes so farre foorth that for this only act or desyre men were brandled to the slaughter, and then passing further on to the depth of his discourse he setteth downe fower famous grounds or principles of Catholyke doctryne all put in order by him, as most sure, and consequent the one of the other which he calleth general groūds  and Maximes of our religion. The first, that  ignorance is the mother of deuotion: The second, that lay men may not medle with matters  of religion. The third, that the Pope, and euery least masse-priest cōming frō him must be obeyed, though he commaund that which  is blasphemous before God. The fourth, that the Popes pardons are ready remedies for all synne among vs though neuer so greiuous, euen immediatly committed against God him-self.
               
                   For answere of all which fancyes the

Warder hauing made a competēt declaration to shew first how fond and ridiculous a māner of proceding this was,The VVarder his defence against the VVatchman the first parte and is in our Kt. after so much folly and flatterie vttered in his former tale of blessings throughout the first Encoūter, to enter now into so shameles a course of forging, falsifying, and lying for defacing of our doctryn and doings, he sheweth first of all the smal reason the Kt. had or hath to contemne so proudlie as he doth, the Clergie of Q. Maries tyme, and of former ages for darknesse, ignorance, and blyndnes, declaring by diuers particulers, that they were farre more learned, then those that since haue stepped vp in their places, and possessed their roomes. And from this he passeth to shew, that the foresaid two preābles about reading scriptures, and the punishment of death ther-vnto said to be assigned, are no wayes true, in any playne meaning sense, or interpretation, but feigned by the Kt. him-selfe, and consequentlie can not euer be proued, or defended, and by occasion of these preambles,About reading of scriptures. the warder entereth into examination of the things thē-selues declaring how farre the reading of holy Scriptures in vulgar languages is permitted to all men among Catholykes, and what restraynt is made therof towards some, & for what causes, and reasons, and vpon what necessitie, and what is the true state of this controuersie betweene vs and Protestants, as also what hurt, profit, damages, or commodities haue or do insue therof, with alleaging both

reasons, authorities, and experiences in that behalf.
               
                   To all which discourse of reasons and experiences set downe at good length by the warder, and conteyning in deed the principal substance of the controuersie, the K•. answereth no one worde, nor so much as mentyoneth the same in this his reply, but passeth to other matters, as by the combat of this insuing Encounter yow wil manifestlie see, and behold and pittie the poore Kt. for this weaknes.
               
                  The second parte of the vvatchmans impugnation and vvarders defence.After this cometh the warder to handle the second parte of this Encounter to wit, about the foresaid foure absurd positions, grounds, and maximes set downe by the Kt. for ours, which the warder prooueth to be neyther Maximes nor minimes of Catholyke Doctryne for that to proue them Maximes all Catholyke wryters must hold them, and to proue them minimes, some one at least must hold thē, but that neyther of these can be prooued. And consequentlie that they are no positions, or principles of Catholyke religion, but fictions rather of heretykes, and false impositions of the Kt.
               
                   And for the first that ignorance is held by vs to be the mother of deuotion,The first forged position. for that the watchman bringeth no other proof but only that reading of Scriptures was forbidden to the lay sorte (at which distinction also of laytie, & cleargie he seemeth to iest) hervpon the Warder taketh occasion first to proue by

many old testimonies the vse and antiquitie of this distinction, wher-vnto the Kt. in this last reply returneth not any one word of answere, and after this agayne the warder declareth largely that this position is neyther Maxime nor minime among Catholykes, and that ignorance is neyther held for the mother, daughter or kinse-woman of deuotion, which he proueth both by the definition of deuotion it self out S. Augustine, S. Thomas, and others, as also by the effects, shewing that deuotion is grounded vpon knowledge & not vpon ignorance though vpon perticular causes the learnedest men are not alwayes the most deuoute. All which discourse the Kt. thought good to passe ouer with silence as wel as the former, without taking any notice therof in this his last reply, and therby yow may see whether yt be more and more substantial that he leaueth vnanswered then that which he answereth.
               About the second position imposed vpon Catholykes,The second position. 
                  that lay men must not medle with matters of religion, as the vntruth therof is more apparant then any of the rest, so was there lesse written in the refutation, but that necessitie inforced the warder to defend S. Thomas of Cā
                     terburie, dishonored, and slaundered intollerably by the Kt. wher-vnto what he answereth in this Wast-woord now and how for defence of his former, falshoods he intangleth him-self in diuers new difficulties and inextricable absurdityes shal be seene afterward

in the particular discussion of matters that ensue.
               
                   In the third position that the Pope or meanest Priest coming from him is to be obeyed vnder payne of damnation though he command blasphemie,
                  The third faygned position. 
                  &c. The warder is more briefe in lyke manner, for that the euident falshood therof is apparant to all yet writeth he so much as is needful for a manifest briefe confutation, and how litle the Kt. hath to answere for deuising of this position, and laying it so falsely to Catholykes charge, yow shal afterwards see discussed.
               
                   And finally about the fourth and last forged ground of Catholyke religion,The fourth false ground. to wit that our chiefe remedy for sinne though it were committed immediatly against God him-selfe is, (to vse the watchmans words) A pardon from his Hol. and absolution from his holie Priests, but yf the decrees or ordinances of their Romish Synagoue were transgressed hardly any mercy was to be had &c. 
                   About this I say the warder obserueth only the apparant cauils, ignorances, and falshoods of the watchmā, as first, that the greatest sinner immediatly committed against God him-selfe are to be remitted among vs by pardons, which is a malitious cauil, for that we hold such pardons to be auaylable only for the payne due to venial sinnes, or for remitting the temporal punishment, remayning after  mortal synne forgeuen before. Secondlie that he conioyneth together Popes pardons, and the absolution of Priests in the Sacrament of pennance, as though they were both one,

which is ignorāce, for that the later remitteth all sinne, and the first not. And thirdly that the transgressors of the decrees and ordinances of the Churche can hardlie euer obtayne mercie, and that they are more hardly pardoned, then the grossest sinnes committed against God himse

To all which obseruations and deductions of the warder the Kt. answereth nothing at all in this last replie, but filleth vp paper with tales eyther deuised by himself, or taken out of Ihon Fox as for example of one

                  h vs, yf the matters alleaged were both true, & to his

purpose. And wheras he addeth, that this report of the beares skin is priuileged for truth by Pope Gregorie the 13. it is a childish cauil, for that Princes priuileges do warrant only the printing, and not the truth of the book, for yf her Maties. priuilege to Fox and Iewels books (for example sake) or to this poore one of S.F. should be an obligation to her Matie. to defend all the lyes and falshoods therin conteyned, it were a pitiful case, and dangerous also to the authors and wryters them-selues, for then were her Matie. obliged in honor to see the same punished when they are found out and at least to graunt the demaund of the foresaid relator of Plessy Morney his disputation to haue our protestants falshoods come to publyke tryal before her person or counsel as those of Plessis Mornayes impostures were examined, and conuinced in presence of the K. of France, which were a daungerous point in England, as matters now stand, I meane daungerons to the credit of Protestāts doctrine and dealing, but otherwyse profitable for the truth, & most honorable to her Matie. and memorable for posteritie.
               But now let vs examine the fact it self  obiected about this beares skinne (for of this I meane to treat first,About the man bayted in the beares skinne. and of the fryars afterward) true it is, that at my being in Rome, I sawe among other pictures, on the English Churche wals of old and new martyrs, diuers representations, and of some cruel vsage of Catholykes for their conscience sake in our

dayes, and among other this portrayture of one in a beares skyn, bayted with dogs, and for that I had not heard, nor read of any such matter publikely done in England I beganne to maruaile how it came to be paynted there, yet considering on the other syde (as euery indifferent man should) that they being graue and learned men that were in Rome at that tyme, and gaue the instructions to the paynter in that matter, and that it was nor likly, they would be so wicked, or foolish, or so litle respect their owne credits, as to inuent, or fayne any such matter of them-selues, & set it soorth so publikely to be seene, and red of all the world, I beganne to ymagin, that eyther themselues knew it to be true, which I knew not, or els might perhaps by letters be informed therof out of England, frō some frends who might affirme it of their owne knowledge, to haue byn done in some priuate manner, & for that the said persons in Rome were now dead, I beganne to informe, my selfe of others, and presently I fel vpon a very sufficient gētleman of Lincolne shyre, who tould me that in the parish of Lowth it is most certayne that in K. Henry the eyght his dayes a Catholyke man was so put to death, being made odious first for the title of Supremacy, and then so bayted in a beares skinne, and that this was done, by certayne vehement heretykes at that tyme, but whether by publike authoritie, or by particular fury, he could not tel, but sure he was that the fame therof is fresh yet in Louth

among all men as easely may be learned.
               I found also an other gentleman of good  worship, who tould me that he heard S▪. Edward Carew (brother to the now L. Chamberlayne) talk of an other such like fact, practised by certayne nobles or gentlemen, for their disport vpon a Catholyke man in this Q. dayes, bayting him with their Spaniels, and whether this be true or no, yt may be easely tryed the partie yet being a liue, but by this it appeareth that they which caused that picture to be paynted in Rome, might haue more ground for yt, then euery man at the first sight, knoweth: and yf they had byn misinformed so farre of from England (as Fox confesseth he was in diuers things in England yt self) it had byn rashnes in them (I grant) to put it eyther in print or wryting. But this litle releeueth S.F. his cause, who is accused to haue set downe and printed things that him-self did know and must needs know to be false when he printed them, which is error not of ignorance, but of obstinacie, and playn lying.
               And this being the true state of our question, I come now to the fryars, whom our Kt. seeketh to disgrace, with this note in his margēt, Fryars braue lyars, but for brauery it agreeth better to gilten spurres, then to gray hoods, and as for lying we shal now examine the matter, wherin the reader shal fynd our Kt. to haue vsed a far worse, and more dishonorable shift, thē the former, that being but a sleight, this a playne imposture, abusing the Author

ghospel,Fox in Calend 2. lan. which begane in England by VVicliffe, as Fox doth testifie, who maketh this first prophet of theirs a Saynt, and kalender Martyr,Fox monumēt. Pag. 421. though he died in his bed at his benefice in Lincolneshire, as Fox denyeth not, yet such was his talent in making martyrs. And besydes this he discouereth to the Reader to much false dealing in that amōg all the faultes of Bishops, nobilitie, comonaltie and religious orders touched seuerally (as yow haue heard) by his author walsingham, he culled out only the lying of Fryars,Syr F. taken in false dealing. and those not of ours, but of his fryars, who were made lyars not by their owne institution, or by our religion, but by the principles of Wiclifs Doctrine which S.F. acknowledgeth (I think) for his. Consider then the mannes wit in alleaging this exā
                  ple, and his truth in handling the same. And by this one iudge of the rest, though there wil not want other occasions after to cōtemplate also the same much more.
               
                   And hitherto now we haue talked of the general charge of lying, and falshood layd to Sr. Francis, and how he hath sought to auoyd the same by recharging vs, and some of ours againe with like fault, which as if they were true and could be verified they deliuer not him of his fault: so being found also to be false, they double his former error, and make him more culpable: to which effect, and for iustifying more the charge layd vpon him of bould false assertions, we are now to examine some other particulars of lyke qualitie.

reading the scriptures in English could not iudge, whether matters of doctrine and religion taught them by their Prelats, were true or no (as though now they could do it by english reading) and that for this cause, and for lack of Scriptures in English a number of lving miracles were beleeued, and in steed of Christs blood, the blood of a duck was worshipped, as the blood of Hales was playnly proued to be▪

                  of a thowsād yeares is vayne for that yt is euident by Bedes playne testimonie, that in his tyme this Iland had the Scriptures in their owne language (as though this only were suf

                   Protestants Religion though it had byn so) and the second, that we do secretly yeild the first 600. yeres after Christs to Protestants, seing we challenge commonly but a thowsand for our selues.
               
                  
                   But by this last point to answere this first, yow may see how wise an Answerer this is, seing that when we name a thowsand yeares we vnderstand from the first conuersion of our English nation vnder Gregory the first,Protestants religion in no age. which no man can doubt of but yf syr F. wil goe higher vnder the Britans, we shal easely also shew the lyke in that tyme. But in the meane space yt is but a hungry trick of this needy knight to snatch that which is not giuē him, to wit 600. yeres together of the primitiue Churche; wherof our meaning is to giue him no one yeare, nor half one, wherin his Religion was extant or had any one that professed the same in those daies as he doth now,Enc. 7. c. 4.5.6.7.8-9. & this I shal largely proue & declare afterward, and this to the second point.
               
                   But now to the first point of proof alleaged out of St. Beede, yf it were true as Syr. F. citeth thesame (& surely knights should haue truth in their allegations) to wit, that Scriptures were in those dayes read by some people in their vulgar languages and tongues which Bede nameth, yet were yt nothing against vs, who do vse thesame libertie, and haue done in all ages to permit some vulgar translations for suche as are thought meet to profit,Enc 1.8. & infra cap. 5. and not to take hurt therby, as before hath byn declared, and after shalbe shewed more at large.
               
                   But now yow must vnderstand, that this playne and euident testimony of S. Bede which Syr F. braggeth of, but quoteth yt not,

(as commonly his shift is; when he would not haue matters exam
                     •
                  ned, or his fraud found out) this place I say of Bede which he alleageth is quite contrary to him: for this sayth Bede.Beda lib. 1. hist Angl. cap. 1.

               This Iland at this present according to the number of the (fyue) Bookes, wherin the law was written (by Moyses) doth in fyue tonges search owt and confesse one and the self same knowlege of the highest truth,A notable abusing of S. Bedes authoritie. and of the true highnes (which is the Religion of Christ Iesus) to wit the tongue of the Angles (or Englishmen) of the Britans, of the Scots, of the Pictes, and of the Latines (or relykes of the Romanes) which Latyn tougue ys now made common to all the rest in meditation of the Scriptures.

of the Britans was different from that which S. Augustine the Monke brought in from Rome to the English nation.Fox monu. pag 107.108. Ho

                  , yet in points or Religion they agree not, as in Bedes tyme when they were enemies, which is the vertue of their vnitie. And thirdly may be noted the euil dealing of Syr F. himself a
                     •
                  so, who in this place sticketh not to auowche to the Reader that by these woords of Bede it is euident and plaine, that the Scriptures were now in all these fyue tonges, where as S. Bede sayth the quite contrary, to wit, that the Latyn tongue was made common to all fyue nations in the meditation of the Scriptures, which could not be spokē to any purpose, yf the Scriptures had byn common to all before in their languages, so that S. Bedes meaning must needes be, that albeit all fyue tongues confessed one and the selfsame highest truthe in one Catholyk Christian Religion, yet in reading and meditation of scriptures and diuine seruice, the Latyn tōgue was the common tōgue. This is his plaine sense though (as I haue said, I doubt not but that in those dayes there might be some Catholyke trāslations into the vulgar tongues, permitted then and after also, as in tyme of K. Edgar and other Kinges we read of, and after that againe vnder K. Edward the 3. Thomas Arundel Archbishop of Cāterbury

               Wherfore yt was not needful that Syr F. should aduenture to shame himself by abusing S. Bedes name and woords to proue a thing that we deny not, though in the sense he would haue yt we say yt is most false, to wit, that Scriptures were publikly and promiscuously red in vulgar tonges at that tyme, & so sayth S. Bede also, and be
                     •
                  ng an Englishman himself, as he was, might haue an action of force (yf not of forgery) against Syr F. for that he hath wrested him against his owne playne meaning: as might Arnobius also whom the Kt. cyteth a litle after in the next page against the Christian vse of Images, for that in his bookes aduersus gentes (which title he cūningly omitted, least it should discouer his fraud, for that Arnobius speaketh against heathenish Idols and not Christian Images) he detesteth (sayth our Kt.) Simulachra & Deos malleis fabricatos. Idols, Gods of Gentils made with hammers.Arnobius abused by Syr F. VVast-vvord Pag. 35. But what ys this to Christian Images which are no Idols? and what dealing is this? what cosenage in a Kt. what violent laying of handes on Authors against their owne sense and meaning, & vpon Gods seruants contrary to their owne intentions, what author may

may not be abused by this boldnes? what wryter may not be wrested against himself? when that their woords expresly vttered against gentils and Heathens be impudently vrged against that Christian Religion which themselues professed. But let vs permit this shift to the Protestants pouertie and so go on.
               
                   There remayneth yet one shift more, which is nothing els indeed but a certayne pettie cauil picked by those woords of myne before rehearsed, That England was accompted vnder those mists and clowds wherof Syr F. talketh) for as wyse, learned, valiant, noble and florishing a Kingdome, as France, Italy Spayne, and other Catholyke Kingdomes be at this day, where yf any one of these our inlightened and sunshined Ministers (which Syr F. braggeth much to haue enlightened the world) should appeare, he would not dare to open his mowth in Schooles and matters of learning, &c.
               
               
                   To this the Kt. answereth two things: first that Rome also when yt was heathen was as wyse, learned and valiant, and yet was yt in darcknes of Religion.
                  A meere cauil. which I denie not, but yt was not as wyse and learned in Christian religion, nor in comparison of other Christian Kingdomes, as I compared England with France, Spayne & Italy & other such states in respect of darcknes mysts and clowds which Syr F. would lay vpon yt. So as both the matter, subiect and obiect being changed in the comparison, no maruaile though yt hold not, and yt is called

among Logicians a fallacie or elenchus, and in English a cauil, and this to the first shift vsed by him.
               The second point which he answereth ys, 
                  that my vaunt of vnmachable learning on our syde (as he tea
                        •
                     meth it) ys vayne and childish, and that our diuinitie is clowdy and owle-lyke diuinitie, yf his Ministers can not vnderstand yt, (as I sayd in the wardword) they did not, and then for the proof of the great learning on his syde, he alleageth the offers of disputation made by Iohn Husse at the councel of Constance, and by Martyn Luther at Wormes and Augusta and of Symon Grinaeus at Spire, and of Beza with others at Poysie in France.
               To the first point of which reply I answere, that for comparison of learning in Protestants and Catholyks I remit me to the proof and iudgment of the wyse, that shal read the books and woorks of both sydes, for better or briefer trial then this we can not assigne, seing they flie the publyke trial of equal disputation, which so often we haue desyred and offred: though their maner of teaching (hauing excluded all substantial and scholastical method and matter out of their Schooles) doth easely shew and conuince the same.
               Wherfore to the second point answered by  Syr F. I say that if yt follow, that our diuinity is therfore to be accompted clowdy & owle-lyke, for that his Ministers can not vnderstand yt, then are all other good sciēces also in a pittiful case (wherof for the most part they are

ignorant) & this a new consequence or kynd o

                   To the third point wherein Syr F. alleageth the disputatiō of Iohn Husse. Martyn Luther, Symon Grinaeus and others, seing he cyteth no Author at all to iustifie his vayne assertion therin (as his maner is when he would not haue his matters examined) I had thought once to haue sayd nothing:The story of Ihon Husse & his disputation at the councel of constance. but considering on the other side his bo

                   First where as he wryteth, that Iohn Hus came to the councel of constance there to defend publikly his assertions,
                  VVastvvord. Pag. 37. 
                  and that those graue Fathers did learnedly refute him by clapping him in prison, loding him with chaines and fetters, and condemned him not only not being conuicted,

               This was one article of Ihon Husse condemned  by a special decree of the said councel in the end therof,Pag. 326
                        •
                     
                   as is to be seene, and the reason why the councel condemned it so solemnly was both the falsitie of the doctrine,Desperate & dangerous doctryne of Hus

                     e. and the scandal which the Emperor, & other Princes there present took of yt. And finally for that he reserued to his owne censure and to those of his sect, who was a Tyrant, and who was not, to wit, any Prince that should be contrarie to them,Enc. 1. cap. 6. as before I haue shewed of our Puritan Caluenists.
               And this being so, what gayneth S. F. by  vaunting of the learning of Ihon Husse, yf all were true that he alleadgeth for him, and being false (as I haue shewed) what booteth him to ly so shamefully for his sake, and how doth he alleage Ihon Husse, who teacheth so many things contrarie to him, and to Caluins

                   By this then a man may see what vnion ground, or certainty these mē haue in religion that gather such members as these into their Churche, nay what conscience also they haue in treating these matters, wherof take an example not only in this Kt. but also in Ihon Fox the Saint-maker, who hauing layd out to the reader an infinite rable of things about this Ihon Husse good aud bad,Iohn Fox his mad treatise of Io. Husse. true and false but all to his prayse for 80. columnes or pages together of his vaste book (but with such confusion as no man can tel what to say or iudge of yt) at length he commeth to repeat the absurd propositions before mencioned namely about Prelats and Princes, that they leese their authoritie when they fal into mortal sinne, which Fox is so farre of from misliking, or denying, as he wryteth, that Husse defended the same, and sayd he would proue yt, not only out of Scriptures (by example forsooth of Saul that was deposed and slayne) but by the authorities also of all old auncient doctors,Fox Pag. 564. 1. col num 5. to wit, S. Augustine, Ierome, Chrysostome, Gregory, Cyprian, & Bernard, (a most impudent brag of a shamels heretyke) and when Ihon Fox hath told all this, and much more, and made a long Catalogue or trētal of his worst articles, he putteth

downe his Iudgment of him in those words.

                  a man may  easely vndestand that Ihon Husse was not accused for holding any opinion cōtrary to the Articles of our fayth, but because he did stowtly teach and preach against the Kingdome of Antichrist, for the glory of Christ, and restoring of the Churche.
               
               Lo heere the truth of Ihō Fox, that Husse, was not so much as accused (much lesse condemned) for holding any one opinion against any article of our Christian fayth. But let the reader see the articles in the councel, and then wil he cry shame of Ihon Fox, and all his crooked cubbes though they haue no shame, especially in that they obiect to vs so often the doctrine of our schoole deuines for allowing the punishing of Tyrāts in some cases with so many limitations, conditions, and restrictions, as by vs are set downe therin. And yet these mē, approue the wicked opinion of Husse in this place as also of the Puritans before recited, that permitteth euery one of their Sect to attempt it at their owne pleasure, and iudgment, which all Catholykes do condemne as doth also this councel of Constance, that condemneth Iohn Husse nominatim of the same.
               But let vs passe on to the other famous Champions of their Religion before mencioned. For of Ihon Husse, this is sufficient yf not ouer much, he being so contemptible an heretyke as by this storie appeareth. Yet Ihon Fox sanctifieth & canonizeth him in his Calender as before hath byn sayd, & the Hussites

in Prage do keep for an honorable relyke of his sanctitie an old payre of leather breches in their publyke Churche, and do shew and kisse the same with great reuerence at certayne tymes, which yet I thinke both Ihon Fox, and S. F. would take scorne to do, and so do Catholykes also, and thus much of Husse which in the Bohemiam tongue signifieth a goose & the Kt. sheweth himself but litle better for bringing him in and giuing him place in the forefrunt of his champions.
            
            
               OF THE LEARNING & glorious disputatiōs of Martyn Luther, Symon Grinaeus, Peter Martyr, Beza, and other protestants boasted of by our Kt. CAP. IIII.
               
                   I Must now come downe lower to other more fresh champions of Protestant Religion, to wit, from Io. Husse, to Martyn Luther, and other by him named. And as for the first that is Luther, I wil be much shorter detecting only some notorious false points affirmed by S.F. partly as I take it of ignorāce, partly perhaps of worse meaning: the ignorance appeareth in that he sayth Martyn Luther first to haue gone to Wormes there by disputation to defend his doctrine before the Emperour; and States, and after agayne to

haue gone to Augusta to the same before Cardinal Caëtan the Popes Legat:Cochl. Sursleid in their histories an. 1518. & 1521. wheras in deed his going to Augusta was three yeares before his going

Secondly the whole narration of S.F. is false touching the stout behauiour of Luther to the Cardinal legat, to wit, that he stood to iustifie his assertions, and offered there or els where to defend them,VVast.

                   sending a wryting in defence to the Card▪ to iustifie his opinion by the Scriptures, and that the Card. would heare no Scriptures, but willeth him to come no more to his presence, vnlesse he would recant.
               In all these words I say, though somwhat  be true yet are there many falshoods, and diuers vntruthes ioyned therwith. For first it is set downe both by Cochleus that was present and Surius that lyued soone after, yf not at that same tyme, & had authentical relation of that which passed, that Maximilian the Emperor, being yet aliue called this yeare a diet at Augusta, partly for warre against the Turks, partly for troubles raysed vp by Luthers new doctrine begunne the yeare before, Pope Leo decimus sent Card. Caëtan for his Legat thither for both causes.Luth. at Augusta 151

                  Cochl. & Sur ibid. to reuoke his errors perticularly, he desired that he might answer in wryting, flattering the Card. with many prayses, and fair words, but yet so tempered he his style in answering, as the Cardinal easely did see that he meant to proceed in the said errors stil, and signified so much vnto him, whervpon he being afrayd, least the Card. would imprison

him, he procured by his frends a publyke safe cōduct of the Emperors officers which assone as euer he had, he appealed from the Legat to the Pope, and put the appellation vpon the walles of the towne, & so stole away, wryting first notwithstanding very fayre letters to the Card▪ at his departure, but vnto others very skoffingly, and contemptuouslie of him, This is the summe of that which the two foresaid Authors and others do write of the doings of Luther this yeare at Augusta let the reader iudge how worthelie S. F. doth vaunt of his chalenge and disputation, and how many lyes there be in his words before set downe.
               The second vaunt of Luthers disputation  at Wormes before the new yong Emperor Charles the fifth,Luther at VVormes 1521. before the Emperor. and his parlament there gathered together three yeeres after, to wit, 1521. is much more vayne, and vntrue. For wheras S.F. sayth,VVast. Pag. Ibid. 
                  that before the Emperor himself, and the whole states of the Empire he mayntayned his doctrine, answered the aduersaries, and with the Emperors fauour departed in safetie, though ful sore against the mynds and wils of some Papists. Yet the truth is this that ensueth for which I alleage my two Authors aforesaid, one of them present at the act it selfe which he published soone after in print S. F. alleaging none at all for his vanities.
               At the sayd diet or Parlament of Wormes  when the most learned man Ieronimus Aliander the Popes Nuntius had propounded the great troubles and dissentions which had rysen the

last three yeares since Luthers being at Augusta by continuance and increase of his heresies,Cochl. in vita Lutheri. Sur. in hist anno 1521. and had recyted out of one of his books, De captiuitate Babilonica lately come forth aboue 40. places which tended all to sedition, & perturbation of the common wealth, Fredericus Duke of Saxony his Patron being much astonished to heare those things, requested that he might haue safe conduct to be sent for, and so he was by a Pursevaunt of the Emperors, named Sturmius: so that this tyme also his coming was not of free wil as S. F. wil haue yt, but of necessitie, nor came he to dispute but to answere for himselfe. And the foresayd Authors do name his compagnions that came with him,Ionas Scurfus Ambsdorfius. the sumptuous and delicate manner of his iorney the good chere, and musick in his Innes,Luthers behauiour in his iorney to the Emperour. and how he himself being yet in a fryers weed played opēly on a Lute as he rode in the Coache, and other such things as Cochlaeus being present did see with his eyes; and I let passe to recount yt in particular for breuities sake.
               
                   But for the principal matter in hand which is his braue disputing wherof S. F. braggeth I read of none at all. For in his first comming before the Emperor and States the first day he was commaunded to harcken only,Luthers ansvvers and behauiour the first day before the Emperour. and to speak nothing that was not demaunded: and then the Catalogue of his books going in his name before recyted publykely, he was asked whether he acknowledged them for his or no? which he saying that he could not deny but

they were his, & being asked agayne whether he would recal them or noe? he desyred most humbly to haue space of deliberation, which with much a doe they graunted him vntil the next day at the same houre,His ansvvere the second day. which being come he appeared agayne, when not answering simply, but deuiding his books into three kynds, sought only to draw out the tyme, which they perceyuing, he was so pressed by the Emperor, and nobles present to say of or on, that in the end he sayth he would do nothing against his conscience, nor recal any book of his except he were conuicted first by the testimony of the Scripture, and then he concludeth with these German words Got helf myr, Amen. that is, God helpe me, Amen. shewing therby the feare that he was in.
               Then foloweth the sentence of the Emperor  some dayes after giuen against him, written with his owne hand to the Lords and Princes of the Empire, a noble sentence, and worthy to be read by all Princes,The determination of Charles the Emperor against Luther, after he had heard him. he being not past 20. yeates of age maketh such a Protestatiō of his Catholyke fayth according to the belief of all his Ancestors as may be an example to all other Princes. And towards the end of the said Parlament he published an Edict against Luther, and all his followers by consent of the whole coūcel, affirming, amōgst other things, Lutherum non hominem sed diabolum esse sub humana specie. That Luther was no man, but a deuil vnder the shape of a man, and this was the end of that combat of Luther.
               
                  
                   But he wrote afterward these Actes of Wormes himselfe, and sayth among other vayne adulations of himselfe, that the people so much fauored him, as one of the companie cryed out (belyke some poore woman that was his Hostes, or other new sister bewiched by him) Beatus venter qui te portauit.

               But yf it were so, yt was no lesse vanitie, & arrogācie in him to report yt of himself, then madnes in the other to make that comparison of him with Christ, and yet it seemeth he was made therby both more proud and obstinate. For albeit he were dealt with all afterward by diuers sent vnto him by the Archb. of Triuers, and others of that counsel to reforme himself, yet would he not, but stil remitted himself to the word of God: which the Emperor vnderstanding sent vnto him his Secretarie the chancelor of Austria commanding him, that within one and twentie dayes he should depart, and put himselfe within his owne securitie agayne, vpon his owne peril. And this was the Emperors fauour of which S.F. so much braggeth that Luther departed from Wormes in safetie, which was to much fauour in deed considering eyther his merits, or the publyke dammages insued by him afterward to the world, and happie had yt beene for many thousand soules yf he had byn dealt withal as Iohn Husse was.
               
                   But now touching Symon Grinaeus, which

is his third example,Fox Act. and men. pag. 1884. excō
                     ment. Melanch. in c. 10. Dan. brought in to shewe the great learned men of his syde, which he took out of Ihon Fox (though for pryde he wil not confesse yt) what doth it proue to his purpose though yt were in all respects as Fox alleageth yt out of Melāchton, as good an author as him selfe,The vayne brag of Symō Grynaeus his learning, & disputation. the storie is this. Symon Grinaeus being at the towne of Spire in the yeare 1529. when Ferdinandus K. of the Romanes was present, and hearing Faber Bishop of Vienna a famous learned man make a Catholyke Sermon, he went to him secretly (as Melanchton reporteth) after the Sermon ended, warning him of certayne errors in his Sermō, as he termed them, being in deed points of Catholyke doctrine, & offring to conferre with him yf he would about the same: But the Bishop being called for at that present by the King told him he could not then, but deferred the same vntil the next day, and in the meane space the Kings officers being informed that Grynaeus a Lutheran was in the towne, and seeking to apprehend him, the Protestants hearing of yt, they attributed it vnto the B. procurement (which perhaps was false) and Grynaeus rāne away by night ouer the Ryuer of Rheene, and so escaped.
               This is the storie of Grynaeus, as his best  frends tel it, wherin yow see there is no mencion of disputation, but only of running away, and how then doth this proue that S. F. men are better learned then ours, especially the last two Luther and Grynaeus a Lutheran, who

are as eager against S. F. with all the learning they haue as they are against vs,Enc. 1. cap. 4. & 5. as I haue s
                     •
                  ewed at large by their words deeds and wrytings in the former Encounter. And moreouer the learning they had, they receyued frō vs among whom they were brought vp, and not from those of S.F. syde. And consequently we may better brag of them then he, yf any thing were in them worth bragging at all as in deed there was not when they fel from the Catholyke Churche to wrangling and heresie.
               
                   There remayneth then the last brag of our Kt. about the colloquy at Poysie in France by Peter Martyr,About the Colloquie at Poysie betvveene Catholykes, & protestants. Beza, and other 12. ministers, wherof S. F. vaunteth as though the Catholykes had receyued the worst in that meeting: but who shal be iudge of this? S.F. alleageth no Author at all, but his owne word, saying, that our Card▪ of Loraine was in a pitiful taking there, and that I must needs yeild,
                  VVast. Pag. 39. 
                  that eyther their men were more learned thē ours there, or that (which he more desyreth) that their cause was better. Wherfore I shal alleage here the summe of the matter out of the best authors that haue written therof as Belleforest, Surius, Pegnillus B. of Mets, and Claudius de Sanctis who was present, and then let the reader himselfe be Iudge.
               
                   First then the truth is this, that Charles the nynth K. of France being newly come to his Kingdome (a child of 12. yeares old) & finding all in warre and garboyle, and that the murder of his predecessor had byn designed

in Geneua the yeare before,Chro. geneb. pag 457. & Sur. in iust. an. 1561. by Caluyn, Beza, Otoman, and others, as Genebrard and Surius do testifie, thought yt expedient (or at least-wayes his mother the Queene) to permit this meeting, somwhat therby to mitigate the heretykes that were in armour, though it being amongst swords on euerie syde the Catholykes did mislike therof, and some refused to come thither: others that came complayned greatly,Complaint of F Laynetz of the colloquie at Poisie and among others Iacobus Laynets a Spaniard, and great learned man, General afterward of the Iesuites, who spoke openly against it in the colloquie yt self, shewing that it was rather a betraying of religion, then defending yt, to put it in dispusation with such disaduantage, when the Hugonots were in the ruffe, and had taken Newhauen, Roane, and most of the chiefe holdes round about, threatning also to ouer-rūne all France, as for the greatest parte they did the yeare following and so was this colloquy dissolued (sayth Genebrad) without any fruite at all.Geneb. anno 1561.
               
               Herevpon diuers bragging, and lying books  were set out by the heretykes of this meeting, and their victorie therin, as though they had gayned all: and one shamed not to say and write, that the Catholykes had yeilded, and offred to become all Protestants: wherof Genebrard writeth thus:Geneb. Pag. 464. 
                  Impudentissimum est mendacium quod Lauaterus scribit, colloquutores Catholicos consensisse cum ministris.

                        •
                     
                   It is a most impudently that Lauater (a Swinglian historiographer) doth wryte, that the speakers of

the Catholyke partie (in Poysie) did agree in opinion with the Ministers. And then he addeth that the sequel of this Colloquie or conference was most bloody warre that ensewed presently throughout all France, and endured for 18. yeares together, and in the verie next yeare after, he sayth that France suffred more in that one yeare of Frenchmen themselues enraged with heresy, then in all former ages by strangers. At what tyme also England took Newhauen into their hands deliuered by the Hugonots.
               
                   This was the case then of the temporal state when this armed meeting of Hugonots was appoynted in France, rather vpon necessitie, and feare (as the Queene mother of Frāce after excused hirselfe, and that famous learned Bishop Claudius Sanctius testifieth it of her owne mouth) then of election & deliberation.Claud. de Sainctes in resp ad Apol. Beze. And to this colloquie for the Protestants came 12. ministers, wherof 8. or 9. were Apostata Fryars as the sayd Claudius (that was present) and Surius do write,Sur. in hist. anno. 1561. and testifie wherof the chiefe and head of those that came from Geneua was Beza,Theod. Beza. Peter Martyr and other Ministers. but of the other that came frō Germany the principal was Peter Martyr, who disagreing from Beza almost in euerie one point to be disputed on (especially about the Eucharist, and baptisme, for that Peter was a playne Swinglian, and no Caluenist) no one thing could be thorowly cōcluded betweene them, which was no smal help to the Catholykes in that terrible tyme, who notwithstanding

lost not their courages, but stood to it and took their places as superiors and Iudges of heretykes (especiallie the Bishops, and other Prelates) next to the King, and other Princes, and made the ministers that would haue thrust themselues in also, to stand a loof, with this reproch as Sanctius sayth,Apoc. 22. 
                  foris autem canes, and yt was no litle mortification to their high stomachs to heare those words, and to be so contemptuouslie vsed, who came into France to that meeting most proud, & magnificentlie prouided and more lyke warlyke triumphers,Resp. ad Apol. Beza. then Apostolycal teachers, as the same author describeth yt in a book dedicated to Beza himself.
               And first he sheweth how and in whose  Coches,The pompe and dissolution of the Caluinian ministers going to poi sie. horslytters and other such furniture they were brought into Fraunce, how sumptuouslie feasted, & entertayned vpon the way with concourse, and meetings of noble men, but especiallie of noble womē who receyued, cherished, and banketted them most sumptuously, with some wherof he sheweth, that Bezas owne compagnions accused him to haue byn ouer familiar, & to haue had sometyme fowre houres conference in great secresy, to wit, he and shee in a Chamber alone, and moreouer he sheweth that Beza his creditors whome he had deceyued at his first flying out of France, were now vpon his back agayne and called vpon him hotly for their money, but in vayne for they had both fauour of great Princes, and good

Hargubushes also to answere for them.
               
                   After this he sheweth that passing through France with an army following them, when they came to Poysie, they were lodged all in a monasterie, where there was such wonderful prouision of delicate bedding, furniture of chambers, and good cheare made for them by those of their faction, as yf they had byn Princes of the blood royal of France, and that whensoeuer they went thence to the assembly so many chaynes of gold, so many Captaynes & noble men went before them for their honour, as was maruelous, and ridiculous, but much more when they returned home againe frō the assembly, they had procured that each of them should haue some great man, and gouernor of some place or Prouince ready to leane vpon,VVonderful delicatenesse of

And surely the pitiful Tragedies that folowed presently vpon this proheeme before these fellowes left France are incredible, (yet much therof may be seene in Belforest, Surius, and others in their histories of the yeare 1562. to which I do remit the reader) and only for our purpose of disputation I say,The good vvhich came of the Colloquie of Poysie that albeit any great euent could not be expected of this meeting for matters of religion in such tymes of garboyles, and with such men: yet this good came to the Catholyke cause therby, that yt was easely perceyued by discreet men, what difference there was betweene the teachers of the one, & the other syde, both in lyfe, and substance of doctrine. For as for lyfe and manners diuers of their owne syde were so scandalized with these twelue Champions behauiour, as they neuer after liked their sect, but returned by litle and litle to Catholyke Religion agayne. And as for substance of doctrine this at the least was seene of all, that the Catholykes agreed in one and shewed their lyke agreement in and by all former ages.
               But the new ministers could not agree fully (as hath byn sayd) in any one point.Dissention of the ministers of Poysie. For about the Eucharist Peter martyr following Swinglius held yt for a figure and trope only, and the bread but a bare signe. But Beza following Caluyn, had a new deuise: that yt was the verie true real and natural body of Christ, but yet spiritually, and with this word spiritually, he cutteth of all agayne that he had yeilded before,

and yet would he not agree in any 
                     •
                  ase that yt was a signe only with the Swinglians.
               The lyke controuersie was among them  about baptisme to wit whether yt were good, and auaylable or no, yf yt were done in tyme of necessitie by a priuate man or woman, and not by a Minister,Pegnil. 1. de disen

                     . ministros in Colloque Pois. which the most parte of those Ministers denyed, as appeareth by the proper letters of Beza and Tafinus head Minister of Mets,Sanct. in resp. ad Apol. Bezae. which Pegnillius Bishop of that cittie set forth in print, translated into Latyn out of French, as they were taken in Chalon of Champayne, and Sanctius testifieth to haue seene the originals, and knowne the subscription of Beza his owne hand.
               So as these fellowes beeing at such warre, &  variance among themselues, & beeing able to agree fully in nothing, but only to be contrarie to Catholykes, what victorie could they get in this Colloquie at Poysie? or to what purpose think yow hath S. F. alleadged it, to proue therby the excellēt learning of his syde, seing yf there were any rare or singular learning in these 12. Ministers, as God knoweth there was litle besydes pryde, & a wrangling spirit, it were rather to be ascribed (as before hath byn said) to our syde then to his: seing the most of them were Apostata Fryars and fugitiues of our campes, where they had studied, and learned their knowledge (yf they had any) except only the art of dissolution, and luxurie, which I leaue to S. F. his schoole. And so an

end of this matter, & of the comparison which (as I said before) is hardly tryed by woords, & particuler examples, but yet whosoeuer wil make but a general viewe of the schooles and learning in the world at this day, may easely ghesse, yf he wil iudge indifferently.
               
                   The Champion O. E, whom we haue kept from the stage hetherto,An addition about O. E. vvhat be sayth touching the difference of learning on both sydes. as saying nothing to this effect, steppeth in heere, as hot as a tost, shewing desyre to haue the matter tryed by disputation, and saying that our learned men being challenged by theirs to dispute in the beginning of this Q. vtterly refused it. Procure vs (sayth he) the lyke libertie to dispute in Siuil, Paris, or Millane, and see whether we wil refuse to come or no.
               
               But seing we challenge them for so many yeares to dispute with them at home with lesse trouble, peril, and charges, and they refuse hitherto, who wil beleeue this ydle vaunt of going abroad? wherby the reader may see, that these men talk not what they think or meane to do, but what may entertayne tyme, and fil vp paper. And so much of his brag for the present, afterward we shal examin him more at large.

                  ptures

was not obiected to Lambert as heresie, but for that he was charged to hold it necessarie vnder payne of damnation to giue the said Scriptures in vulgar languages to all people, which was an heretical, and false assertion. The Rhemists also (which is the third obiection) do cal the said opinion of Lambert about the necessitie of reading Scriptures in vulgar tongues by all sortes, erronious, and not the reading of Scriptures yt self.
               Now then let vs heare and examine S. F. argument made vpon the words of our Rhemists  before recited.Pag. 47. The absurd, & vulearned manner of reasoning vsed by the Knight. 
                  Now (sayth he) yf to think the Scriptures may be read indifferently of all he in your iudgement an heretical opinion: then for men to read them is in your iud
                        •
                     ement, an heretical action. Mark (good Reader) 
                     •
                  . F. manner of argument first he peruerteth the words alleaged by himself our of our Rhemists. For they say, It is erronious to put necess
                        •
                     tie for all to read. But he sayth, they affirme it heretical that all may read. Now betweene must & may erronious, & heretical, there is much difference. Then doth not this second proposition follow of his first, for though it be erronious or heretical to hold necessitie of publishing the Scriptures in English to all (as Lambert did hold) yet followeth it not, that 
                     •
                  he reading it self is heretical: for a man may haue leaue to read and so auoyd all fault, and

                     •
                  o be read of all. And to the end (good reader)

thou maist see the vanitie of his former consequēce, consider the same in an other exāple. It is an erronious and heretical opinion to say, that all men and women may or must preach, teach and administer Sacraments without ordination or licence, ergo it is heresy, or at least wayes an heretical action to teach, preach, & administer Sacramēts, who seeth not the folly of this consequence.
               
                   But now where-as the warder vpon this occasion entreth into the verie substance of the matter,The cheefe substance of the matter omitted by Syr F. shewing at large how and in what sense reading of Scriptures in vulgar tongues is forbidden in the Catholyke Churche, and vpon what causes and how farre, and to what persons, and to what end, and with what limitations, and how falsely heretykes do cauil, and slaunder them in this behalf and confirmeth the same by many authorities, arguments, and euident reasons: as also that the right vnderstanding of Scriptures is a peculiar gift of God and not common to all, and that experience both of our, and old tymes, haue taught vs the great euils, and daungers which had ensued by schismes, heresies, and varieties of opinions gathered out of Scriptures by euil interpretation, alleaging also diuers examples for the same.
               
                   To all this (I say) being the pith and substance of the whole matter S. F. answereth not one word according to his shift of omission before mentioned when he hath nothing to answere and therfore vsing silence in this he

passeth ouer to the second vntruth obiected, that men are brandled to the slaughter for only reading vpon Gods book, leauing the first sticking on his sleaue, as yow see, and much more confirmed then remoued by his answere. For seing he affirmed it so stoutlie before that we held it heresy, euen to think or desyre to read Scriptures in English; why had he not alleaged some one playne text, some Canon, some one sentence, some one Author of ours, some book, scrip or scrolle, where we say so, and where we do pronounce that first for heresie? why runneth he to so blynd & weake arguments, and coniectures as yow haue heard?

               But now to the second vntruth whether  men were put to death in deed for only reading scriptures:About the second vntruth, vvhether men vvere put to death for only reading scriptures. VVastvvord. Pag. 43. this dependeth of the first. For yf it be euident that we hold not that the only reading of Scriptures is heresie, as he affirmeth and we haue shewed the contrarie, then followeth yt not to be likely, that we brandle men to death with fyer for this fact: which is a punishment due to heresie. Let vs see then what the K•. sayth heere.
               First of all he picketh a quarrel as though I had added somewhat to his wordes saying▪
                  Pag. 43.
                  
                  Before I proced to the iustifying of my speach,
                  Pag. 43. 
                  geue me leaue to tel yow that this word (onely) by yow thrust into my words is one ly of your coyning though not the only one lye.
               
               
                   Heere (gentle Reader) I wil make the Iudge of this new quarrel, to wit, whether this new onely lyeth on his syde onlie, or on myne, and I wil cal no other witnesse, but the Kt. owne words to try the controuersie. Can I deale more franklie then this? Heare then himself against himself, for thus he wryteth. For though it were but onely a desyre to read vpon the holy book, &c. heretike was his title, heresie was his fault, and for this he was called before the Romish Cleargie, brandled, &c. If yow fynd only in his owne worde
                     •
                  , then do yow lay this new onely where yow find yt, and there is an end of that matter, for with so open impudency I wil no further stryue.
               
                   It shalbe to no purpose also to refute that notorious,Pag 43. S. Francis vvorthy to ly for the vvhetstone. and ridiculously, where without cyting any author at all the Kt. sayth that an old Doctor among the Sorbons protested that he had studied more then 50. yeares ore he could tel what the new testament was, &c. Wil any man beleeue him in this? or is he not worthy to ly for the whetstone, that wil auouche this in print? And yow must vnderstand by the way that the Doctors of Sorbon are Doctors of diuinitie, and haue much exercise out of the Scriptures before they can take degree, how thē did this Doctor neuer so much as heare of the new Testament in 50. yeares studie? But heare yet another as

improbable as this without author also: An Italian Bishop (sayth he) told one Espeucaeus that his contremen durst not read the Scriptures, least they should become heretiks therby. A goodly tale. And what author is cited for this? none at all. Yow must take it vpon the K•s. credit, and what that is, or deserueth to be his doings declare.
               But now to the principal poynt, how doth  he proue that men were brandled to the slaughter for only reading the old or new Testament?
                  VVast-vvord Pag. 44. he alleageth diuers exāples out of Ihon Fox in these words Our stories are ful of Examples out of your owne registers that reading of Scriptures was accompted heresie, and not to stand vpon many:
                  Fox act. and mom. Pag. 752. & deinceps. 
                  vnder Longland B. of Lincolue Agnes welles was conuented and examined whether Thrustan did euer teach her the Epistle of S. Iames in English,
                  VVel proued 
                  and Thomas Chase was charged for hearing the said Epistle read in English, Agnes Ashford for teaching Iames Norden certayne sentences of Scripture in English, Robert Pope, Ihon Mordon and his wy
                        •
                     e that they recited the ten commandements in English Ihon Fippes for that he was rype in the Scriptures and the lyke proceeding was vsed by other Bishops, as namely by Tonstal, then B. of London, before whom many were conuented for that holy heresie of reading Scriptures, &c.
               
               Thus he sayth of whom a man may hardly  say whether he brought these exāples to proue or disproue his owne saying which is great simplicitie in any writer not to discerne what maketh for him, or what against him, seing by these examples in steed of prouing his second proposition he ouerthroweth both the first, &

second: The second about brandling to death, for that these his owne examples do shewe that none of them that were accused were put to death for reading, but had some lighter punishmēt only for their disobediēce in that act, his first proposition he ouerthroweth also, which was, that reading of Scriptures was accōpted heresie, for that the fault of reading scriptures in this place is ioyned, and equalled with things which no man wil say that we hold for heresies, as the reciting of the 10. commandements in English, and the cy
                     •
                  ing of certayne places in our English tongue out of the Scriptures. And consequeutly these exāples if they be graunted to be true in fact (as the most of them are amplified by Ihon Fox) yet proue they not, but directly rather do disproue that which the Kt. should proue.
               
                   Wherfore the only thing that these exāples do proue is,Examples fondly alleadged that make against him. that the reading of Scriptures in vulgar language without licence, and perhaps heretical translations in tymes of heresies, and by such persons as can not be presumed to profit therby, may be a sufficient cause to the B. to conuent, apprehend, or examine them vpon suspition of heresie, as yf a ciuil Magistrate in tyme when many robberies are committed, shal cal in question, apprehend or examine certayne men that spend much and haue litle of their owne, go gay in apparel & play at dice, and the lyke, by which they may be suspected of theft though the verie act of playing be not theft: and as yt should be slaunderous

and ridiculous in that case yf any man would crie out of that common wealth or Magistrate, saying, it were tyrannical, that men should be imprisoned for costly apparel, faring wel, or playing at dice, as though those acts were theft, or fellonie (which in deed are not, but only may induce to theft or giue suspition therof) euen so in our case, it is as meere a calumniation to affirme that we hold reading of Scriptures for heresies which is false though in certayne persons in whome yt may perhaps engender heresie, or giue suspition therof thesame may be punished for disobedience and disposition to heresy. And this is sufficient, or rather superfluous in so vayne a matter against the babling of our fond kinght.
               And by this is answered a lōg tale also that  he hath out of Fox of a book seller of Auinion in France condemned to death by the B. of Aix for selling french bybles in the vulgar tongue of whom S. F. concludeth in these words:VVastvvord. Pag. 46. 
                  And so exhorting the people to read the Scriptures, he was for this cause only cruely put to death. By which he would haue his reader vnderstand, that only for reading Scriptures, and exhorting men ther-vnto he was cruely put to death which is playne cosenage. For in the storie of Fox himselfe, which the Kt. craftelie omitteth it is conteyned, that the bookseller vpon examination was found, an heretyke, & denied the authoritie of the Bishop and his office, and other ecclesiastical Iudges, saying:

                  That they were rather the Priests of Bacchus and venus then the true Pastors of the Churche of Christ,

                   IT may seeme much perhaps to the Reader that O. E. hath byn kept so long tyed vp from barking somwhat in these affayres before handled, but now we shal vncoople him, and yow shal heare how he wil behaue himself.

But now to the matter in hand.

Maries raigne, and of other former English Catholyke Princes, was altogether in darknes, clouds, shadowes, mists, ignorance, and the lyke, as the watchman had affirmed: The warder by many cleare reasons and demonstrations sheweth the contrarie, & that among other poyntes, there was not a more learned Cleargie for many ages in England then vnder Q. Maries gouernment. Whervnto what the Kt. hath replyed agayne in this his answere, yow haue heard before, now shal yow heare how this his prating procter O. E. doth iump in with him, aduertising

yow by the way (yf yow haue not obserued yt before) of one notorious cogging tricke which this gamester hath aboue all the rest that euer I knew of his occupatiō (though I haue knowne fewe good, and many ba

                   Now then to the foresaid enumerations of good, and learned Bishops, and other cleargie men, in Q. Maries dayes, he answereth thus: First admit these men whom he nameth were great Doctors,
                  Pag 42.

& this is seene by the bad fruits therof which both England, and other nations doe dayly feele.
               And as for the publike seruice, & Christian  sacrifice it self called the Masse,
                  About the Latyn Masse.
                   wherunto Catholyke people do resort withal reuerence, to be present and assist, for acknowledging their bound duety, and humble deuotion towards almighty God, by this publike adoration appointed by him in his Churche, it is not necessary, that all particular people should vnderstād all the words therin vsed by the Priest and publike minister in administration therof: to which effect read in the beginning of S. Lukes ghospel that Zacharias the father of S. Ihon Baptist being a leuitical priest and comming to his turne to do the publike seruice for the whole people,Luc. 1. the Scripture saith of him. Sorte oxijt vt incensum poneret, ingressus in templum Domini, & omnis multitudo populi erat orans foris hora incensi. It fel to him by lot that he should go into the temple of God to offer incense, & all the multitude of people did pray without at the howre of incense.
               Lo heere the whole multitude of people  came to the publike seruice appointed in the Churche,A ponderation of the fact of Zacharie father to S. Ihon Baptist. though they neyther vnderstood all of them the language, wherin it was made (for it was in Hebrew, and their vulgar language was Syriack at that tyme) neyther yet if they had vnderstood it, were they admitted so neare, as they could heare it, but standing a farre of were content to pray alone, and to

ioyne in hart and affection with the priest Zacharie, and God we see was highly pleased therwith, and sent an Angel to ta

                  m in that place, and to tel him the good newes of his sonne S.

                   By this then we see the pratling of O. E. against prayers in latyn, Masse, mattins, and euen-song. &c. is partly false in the fact it selfe, and wherin it may be true it concludeth nothing to his purpose, yet he goeth on in his rayling manner,Pag 43. saying; they were likewise taught to pray not only to Angels, Saints, and to our Ladie; but before stocks and stones, &c. But let this whipster tel vs, where they were taught to say o stock, or o stone helpe vs, or pray for vs &c.

               He falleth then vpon the controuersie before  handled by me against Sr. F. whether Catholykes do hold reading of Scriptures to be heresie, Sr. F. (as yow haue heard) wēt so farre in that matter, as he said, that though it were but

only a desyre to read vpon the holy book of God, eyther the old or new Testament, then heretike was his name, and heresie was his fault, &c.

E. why this constitution was alleaged by him,

seing it proueth nether the one nor the other of the forsaid poyntes (both which he sayeth are proued thereby) to wyt that reading of Scripture was accompted heresy,The Archb. constitution is against O. E vvho alleageth it. or punished by brandling, nay both these assertions are refuted by this: the first for that translation & & reading of scripture in the English tongue by lycens of the Bishop was permitted, ergo, it was not heresy, for that noe Bishop can permit heresy: secondly for that the punishment of excommunication is neyther death nor burning: ergò for this they were not brandled.

               And this might be sufficient for somuch  as concerneth this point of reading scriptures, wherein yow see how vaynly this vnlearned and ydleheaded Minister behaueth himself running in and out, forth and back without rule or order sense or reason. But yet I must follow him a litle further in certaine quarrels picked against me. The first wherof is, for that I do alleage these woords of S. Paule,2. Cor. 3. 
                  litera occidit, Spiritus autem viuificat. The letter killeth but the spirit giueth lyfe, therby to proue that it is not sufficient to read only the woords of scripture except they be rightly also vnderstood, and consequently that all standeth not in reading specially amongst the ignorant who oftentymes receaue more hurt

then good thereby herevpon commeth in the Minister very hotly,Pag. 47. saying: He doth shame

                     ully abuse the woordes of S. Paule to the condemning of reading of Scriptures. But soft Sir, I neither abuse nor vse the woordes of the Apostle to the sense yow falsely say, but to that sense which other holy Fathers before me haue vsed & alleaged them,S. Hier. Ep. ad Nepot. in 3. Reg. c. 1. as namely S. Hierome, and S. Augustine cyted by me in the Ward-woord, and passed ouer craftely by this companiō,Aug. de Spiritu & littera c. 4 & 5. & primo Retract c. 4. as though he had neuer heard of them. And besides that which there I said I wil heere adioyne an other place of his, lib. primo ad Simplician. q. 1. where he saith:
Lex tantummodo lecta & non intellecta vel non impleta vti

thesame in one sense, though in an other he admitteth it. The Swinkfeldians indeed and Lybertines (Children of the new Gospel of Martine Luther, and consequently our Ministers brethren) did deny the external letter of the Scripture founding themselues vpon this place of S. Paule, litera occidit, which Bellarmyne denyeth to serue to that purpose. But this is nothing to our sense who deny not nor condemne (as this Noddy slaundreth vs) eyther the external letter of Scriptures themselues or the reading therof with discretion, due reuerence and order, but only rashe and presumptuous reading and interpreting the same, according to their owne sense and vnderstanding, different from the meaning and interpretation of the auncient Fathers & Catholike Churche.

And mark heere (good people) the assurance which these men doe teache yow for your safty in reading scriptures, when yow vnderstand not the letter of the Scripture, first (saith he) yow must goe to Christ the best interpreter, and when yow vnderstand not Christs interpretation, yow must returne to the letter of the Scriptures to know the excellency of Christs interpretation, and yf yow vnderstand neither, then must yow goe to the interpretation of the Churche, and yf yow vnderstād not that, then must yow goe backe againe to the scriptures to assure your self (as he saith) of the excellency of the Churches interpretation.Intricat dealing of hereticks about vnderstanding of scriptures. But in all this going and comming, turning and wynding, I would aske our whirle-headed Minister who shalbe iudge? or where shal the stay be? or how can symple people discerne of these things which he prescribeth?

but to take and leaue or like at their pleasures commonly their wits guyded by humaine spirit inclyne to incredulitie, calling in question what others haue held or beleued before them, and shaking of the foundations of all former belief by their new quarrelling: and whether the Sectaries of our tyme haue done this or no by their much reading and tossing of scriptures, let experience teache vs. And this shal suffice for this place.

                   WE haue byn occupied hitherto about so many other falshoodes and vntruthes of these our aduersaries vttered in their preambles as we haue not byn able to come to the principal subiect of this Encoūter, which is a quadruple number of absurd grounds & positions, which the knight affirmeth vs to hold for general grounds and Maximes of our religion: wherof the first and ring leader is, that ignorance is the mother of deuotion, which

he vttereth in these woords.
                     VVatch. p. 17
                     The first forged position.
                   
                  In these darck and clowdy dayes (saith he) least the Sunshine of knowlege should disperse the mystes of ignorance, and giue light to the dymme of sight, this position was set downe for their Maxime or rule infallible, that ignorance is the mother of deuotion, & that the sacred woord of God which was giuen to be a Lanterne to all our feet and a light to our steps was forbidden to the lay sorte (for so they called them) as matter vnfit for them to looke into. To which the warder beginneth his answere thus.

How then and with what face complayneth he so piteously or rather hypocritically, that the sacred woord of God which was giuen to be a lanterne to our f

                     ete, &c was forbidden to the lay sort.
               
               To this interrogatiō of the warder Sir Fraūcis replieth now noe one syllable more then before is sayd.VVhether ignorance be the mother of deuotion. And further where as the warder chargeth him sorely with malepart ignorance for scoffing at the woord (laymen) and a

                   the distinction betwene Laytie and Cleargie, and by this occasion sheweth the true meaning of those woords, with the auncient begynning vse and practize of the primitiue

Churche, out of Origen Epiphanius Hierome and diuers other fathers, doctors & general Coūcels, the patient knight dissembleth all this according to the first shift discouered in the beginning,Sir. F. and O. E. do flie shamfully. and saith nothing at all to it neither doth his Proctor O. E. helpe him out herein with any one woord, though woords be very good cheape with him.
               
                   After this the warder cometh to the positiō it self, saying: But we deny this Maxime or infallible rule to be ours, and do say that it is your calumniation only, and not our position, and that among vs it is neither Maxime no
                        •
                      Minime. And for yow to proue it a Maxime, yow must shew that all Catholykes or the most part do hold it: and to proue it a Minime, at least yow must shew that some one doth hold it: neither of which yow can euer doe, and so yow remayne disgraced.
Thus said he what answereth Sir F. Thus:VVast. pag. 47. 
                  A strange accusation and grieuous slaunder (no doubt) to charge those men with nourishing the people in ignorance whom all the world knoweth to haue vsed strange meanes to bring them to knowlege. For what meant they by the costly setting vp of many faire and wel guylded Images in Churches? was it not that they might be lay mennes bookes, and by reading on them they might attaine knowlege?
               
               
                   To this I answere first, that this proof is far of from shewing that it is a Maxime and infallible rule among vs, that ignorance is the mother of deuotion, why is not this proued, especially seing Sr. F. is required in honor to do it? Is the running

to the controuersy of Images a sufficient discharge for this? Doe not all men see, this kynd of shifting? But let vs say somewhat to his instance of faire guilded Images, as though they made to his purpose. First then I say that those faire Images of Christ and his Saints, against which he enueigheth, if they be ioyned with other instruments of light & instruction as are preaching, teaching and suche other like, vsed among vs, can not be a hinderāce to knowlege as the Kt. would seme to affirme, but rather a furtherance; for that otherwise, why hath Ihon Foxe so many pictures and payntings in his book, but to teache men therby the contents of his writings. But consider reader here (as before I haue sayd) the substance of heretical answering, which runneth vp and downe & neuer commeth to the purpose. Hath not the warder offred our watchman fayre and frendly, that whereas he hath affirmed, written & published in print, that it is a Maxime among vs & rule infallible, that ignorance is the mother of deuotion, we are content that he proue it only a Minime? And where as for proof of the former he was bound to shew that all Catholike wryters or the most part of them auouched it, we are content to accept the woord or testimony of any one Cath. author, learned or vnlearned that euer wrote or printed such a position?
               And is not Sr. F. then with his whole presbyterie  of ministers maruelously shamed yf they bring not forthe some one suche wryter?Impertinent dealing of our aduersaries.

               And this is so necessarie a point of doctrine for the saluatiō of the common sort of people, as yf we take it away (as Sectaries doe who vnderstand it not) it must needs follow, that thowsands yea millions of Christians must perish for lack of fayth,The necessytie of

                        ides implicita for saluation of the common sort of Christians. seing the whole first Councel of Nice set downe this dreadful foundation, as appeareth in the creed of S. Athanasius: that it is necessarie for him that 
                        •
                     il be saued to hold the whole Cath. faith, which yf any man doe not, he must perish eternally, wherof must needs be inferred, that for so muche as the far greater parte of Christians do not know or vnderstand the forsaid pointes of faith and manie more belonging to many misteries of Christian Religion and consequently can not beleue them but only by fides implicita as hath byn shewed, it followeth (I say) that if we take away the truth and vse of fides implicita which euer hitherto the Cath. Churche hath taught yow must needs teache desperation and damnation

to the vnlearned sort, that eyther for lack of tyme, capacitie, learning and other such lets, can not come to know and beleue all particulars belonging to a Christian set downe in bookes or handled by learned men, but content only with the cleere and distinct beleef of such articles as are most needful and important, do beleue the rest fide implicita, that is, by the implied faith of the Churche.
               Wherfore how so euer this distinction of  
                  fides explicita and implicita may trouble the vnlearned Sectaries of our tyme, and giue them occasion to iest at that they vnderstand not, as Sr. F. doth here, yet the thing it self is most euidently true and necessary and the same distinction in other woords is set downe by S. Augustine, where he speaketh of the differens of the faith of holie men vnder the old testament, he not being able otherwise to defend the position of S. Paule and other Apostles, affirming the old good Iewes to haue beleued also in Christ, & to haue had the self same faith that we haue in substance, but only by this distinction, though set downe in other woordes. For thus he writeth:Aug. lib. 
                        •
                     5. Cont. Faust. cap. 14.

                        •
                     rum, &c. Then (vnder the old testament) the faith of Saints (wherby they beleued Christ to come and all his mysteries) was hiddē or couered, for that all iust & holie men of those tymes beleued the self same things that we do now, and did hope for the same, but now our faith is cleere & reuealed.
               
                  
                   Thus saith S. Augustine: making the same difference in effect as yow see, betwene t
                     •
                  e faith of vs (Christians) and of those vnder the old testament, as we do betwene learned and vnlearned men at this day, the one being cleere, distinct & particular, the other obscure, confuse and more general, for so much as those points of Christs incarnation, diuynitie, person, natures, wils, sacraments, passion, resurrection and the like, which we beleue now distinctly and cleerly; and in particuler, they beleued obscurely and more confusedly as vnder a vaile,2. Cor. 3. as the Apostle termeth it, and as it were in grosse and general: in that they beleued whatsoeuer the Prophets and Patriarches had fortold or beleued of Christ to come, and his doctrine and mysteries, as the more vnlearned sort of Christians do now, in beleuing whatsoeuer the Churche holdeth, though in particular they knew not euery point which she holdeth but only the most notorious and needful, as those general heades commonly called the Articles of the Creed, & some other deduced therof, and appointed to be taught and explaned to euery Christian more in particular, though not all, but so many as are necessarie to be knowen for their saluation. And this simplicitie of belief in the common sort which our scoffing knight calleth the Colliars faith (himself being more ignorant in diuers pointes of true faith then many Colliars or Coblers in the Catholike Churche) the foresayd holie father and learned

doctor S. Augustine doth so highlie esteme as he dareth auouche against as stowt an heretike as our K•. or his Ministers, this sentence:Aug. 1. cōt

                        •
                      simplicitas tutissimam facit. The vulgar sort of Christians are made most sure of their saluatiō by the viuacity of their vnderstanding, but by the simplicity of beleeuing, &c.
               Wel then (good readers) all this that hitherto  hath byn said hath byn to lay before yow the fond cauillations of wrangling Sectaries, about fides explicita and implicita, they vnderstanding nether the nature, vtility, or necessity therof. For the truth is, that Cath. religion doth hould them both, and iudgeth both most necessary in all sorts of men, though they are more in some then in others.The necessity of fides explicita in all men. For as for fides explicita all Catholyke wryters do agree that all sorts of Christians whatsoeuer must haue it in the principle articles of Christian beleef vnder paine of eternal damnation, that is to say, that all Christians learned and vnlearned of what sort so euer must be taught to beleeue expressely, cleerly, and distinctly, the principal misteries of Christian religion, as for example the misteries of the Blessed trinity, and incarnation, &c. This doctrine is so ordinary and vniuersal among Catholiks,D. Thom. 2. 2. q 2. art. 6.7.8. &c. as S. Thomas hath diuers whole articles therof and all other schoole diuines do agree about that matter, though our Kt. would gladly haue men to think that we do not teach this fides explicita as necessarie to any almost of the simple sort.
               
                  
                   Secondly our Churche teacheth, that albeit this cleere and distinct faith be necessary to all Christians in certayne articles, yet not to all a like,More things necessary to be beleeued by some than others. but that the learneder sort are bound to know & beleeue by this faith more thinges thē the simple especially those that must teach others, as Curats, Pastors, Preachers, and the like, and more then all the rest, Bishoppes and Prelates, which S. Thomas declareth in these words:Secūda, 2. q. 2. art. 7. in corp. artic. 
                  post tempus gratiae reuelatae, &c.
                  After the comming of Christ, as wel teachers as the people are boūd to haue fidem explicitam, cleere and expresse beleef of the misteries of Christian faith especially touching those points that are solemnized in the Churche, and are publikely proposed vnto them, as are the articles of the incarnation before treated: But as for more higher considerations some are bound to beleue more and some lesse according as the state and office of each one requireth, &c.
               
               
                   And againe yet further: plura tenentur explicitè credere maiores,
                  Ibid. art. 6. ad primum. 
                  qui habent officium alios instruēdi, quam alij:
Those that be in Ecclesiastical authority, or haue obligation to teach others, are bound also to beleeue more things expressely and distinctly then others.
Thus teacheth our Churche, and the discreet reader wil easily iudge, with how great reason, piety & necessity, for the saluation of those that are committed to her charge.
               
                   And to the end yow may see with how litle iudgment the sectaries of our tyme, and namely

                  aine to affirme & put in print that publike

prayer in the Churche is the chief and principal part of deuotion. Which yf it were true, then singers, readers organists and other that performe the said publike seruice should be euer most deuout, wherof commonly notwithstanding the contrary is found by experience. And it is a most absurd thing in the knight and his Ministers to defyne an internal vertue by an external act, albeit thesaid act of prayer may sometymes be an effect of deuotion in good men, though not alwayes or of necessitie, for that a man may be inwardly deuout, and yet not pray externallie: and againe he may say many external prayers with the lyppes without true internal deuotion of the hart, as beggars are wont to doe for an almes, and ministers for their fee. And thus I am forced to leese tyme in teaching this old knight very ordinarie groundes and principles not only of true diuinitie, but also of very moral philosophy.
               
                   But let vs goe foreward, and see whether he haue any more proofes for his false former assertion of ignorance to be the mother of deuotion, for that these hitherto are found to be none at all, but shiftes and follies. Our contriman (saith he) the Popes Champion D. Stapleton confidently affirmeth,
                  D. Stapl. against Ievvel, art. 3. p. 75. 
                  that denotion is not furthered but hindered by a tonge that is vnderstood. Loe here a goodlie proof, and wel to the purpose. But I answere yow that he affirmeth it not so confidentlie (Sir) as yow guilfully relate him) corrupting both his woords and his meaning: For he saith

not absolutely as yow would make him,Hovv a knovven tong may let invvard deuotion more then an vnknovven. that the act & exercise of a mannes deuotion is all wayes hindered by a knowen tonge, but that sometymes in some case it may be; as for example, if a deuout man vnderstanding not Latyn would exercise his priuat deuotion & contemplation a part in S. Paules Churche at London when your Ministers are chaunting their English seruice: cleere it is that the lesse he should vnderstand the woords of the singers, the lesse distraction he should haue from his inward deuotion and recollection of mynde, so as in this case, a knowē toug would hinder deuotion more then an vnknowen, which is the case wherof Doct. Stapleton and other Catholykes doe speak, and in this sense it is most true and euident to all that vnderstand the nature of deuotion, which Sir Fr. and his Ministers seeme not to doe, eyther in the nature of her definition, or in tendernes of affection and inward feeling, as the Warder telleth him.
               Wel then we haue heard his proofes hitherto  for the position before set downe, no one of them prouing any thing at all, or being to the purpose. Now let vs heare his last, and most substantial proof. In a woord (saith he) D. Cole deane of Paule's in the disputation at VVestminster did a
                        •
                     ow euen in the honorable assembly of the Councel and Nobles, and frequent concourse of the Commons with great vehemencie this proposition in these woords. I say, ignorance is the mother of deuotion. Lo, heer what a goodly birth is brought forth after

so long traueling, no book, no wryting, no one letter can be alleaged to proue this Maximè, but only the saying of one in vehemency of disputation, and this also without any certayne witnesses besides the aduersary himself. Yf Doct. Cole should haue vttred any suche woord in that vehemencie which heer is signified,A Cauil 
                        •
                     . ou
                        •
                      D. Cole. were this sufficient to make it a Maximè and infallible rule of belief among all Catholykes? Or can this deliuer Sr. F. from rashnes and leuity to haue written and printed, that we all hold it so? Doctor Cole might say perhaps, or any other, that the leardnest men are not alwayes the most deuout, and so doth the Warder also, setting downe the reason therof out of S. Thomas at large, for that deuotion depending more of the affections of our mynde then of our knowlege and vnderstāding, is fownd more aboundant oftentymes in the simplez sorte. And if Sr. F. vnderstood the nature of vertues and were not obstinat in respect of mayntayning his owne heretical credit, he would see and acknowlege so much also, and recal his former mad calumniation, that we hold Ignorance for mother of deuotion:Lib de 
                        〈◊〉
                     . but as Tertullian saith: It is easier for Sectaries to a
                        •
                      ten new errors then to recal one. For which cause I wil vrge this matter no further against him.
            
            
               
               THE MINISTER O. E. is called vp, to help out his K. in defence of this first forged position and how he performeth the same. CAP. VIII.
               ANd yet before we leaue of this whole  treatie we haue thought it best to cal vp the stage once againe O.E. the knights proctor and souldiour of succour, to heare what he hath to say, for it is likely that comming after the Kt. he wil ad somewhat to the others inuention, and bring some new knack or other to help out his graueled Kt. and to intertaine the reader withall, wherfore it shal not be amisse to giue him the hearing: thus then beginneth this new Mowntebank his tale: I say that it is most true that Sr. F. doth obiect viz,
                  Pag. 42. 
                  that Papists hold Ignorance to be the mother of deuotion. Loehere a new Pithagoras that wil be beleued at his woord, I say (quoth he) And what are yow sir I pray yow, that we must beleue yow after the Kt. and more then him, who hauing said it, oftentymes before, hath not hitherto byn able to proue it? Let vs heare then how yow wil play your parte, who came in so freshlie and auouche so stoutlie: Let vs heare your proofes. Yt followeth ymediatlie. Doctor Cole (saith he) in a certaine disputation at vvest-minster did openly affirme it. This is no more then was sayd before and not proued, &

therfore foolishly brought in now againe by the supplier. But heare hym out further for he hath yet more to say: Hosius (saith he) affirmeth,
                  Ibidem. An issue ioyned vpon the vvoords ascribed to Hosius. 
                  that ignorance is not only worthie pardon but reward also. And is it so Sir & wil yow stand to it? wel then let vs ioyne vpon this yssue, & see who shalbe cast, & let the reader first note that the false Minister setteth downe these woords ascribed to Hosius in a different letter, to make them more markable, as yf they were Hosius his owne woords indeed. And secondly let hym consyder, that whose woords so euer they be, yet do they not proue the former proposition that Ignorance is the mother of deuotion, but only that some kynd of ignorance or lack of some knowlege may not onely be pardonable but meritorious also, which is a different thing from auouching Ignorance to be the mother of deuotion.
               
               
                   But let vs examyne the point, whose woords these are, & therby discouer a notorious trick of a coosening companion in this Minister, who reading these woords in Hosius, & seing him to alleage them out of S. Hilary a most auncient and authentical author, would not cyte them as the woords of S. Hillary, least they should haue more credit with the reader then himself, that sought to discredit them, but thought best rather to forge and father them vpon Card. Hosius, albeit he told hym expresly that they were the woordes of S. Hillary, and so cyted them with the place quoted in the margent, for that Hosius

hauing set downe many other authorities of auncient fathers, to proue what a great and singular benefyt we receaue by the force of that article of our Creed,A coosening trick. 
                  Credo sanctam Ecclesiam Catholicam, I beleue the holie Catholike Churche, and all that she holdeth & teacheth, he sheweth that among other commodityes which we receaue from thence, one is, that simple men vnderstanding only the principle and necessarie points of their faith, and professing with S. Paul,1. Cor. 2. 
                  that they beleeue Christ Iesus crucified (and therein all that belongeth therevnto) for other matters and mysteries of higher capacitie, it is not absolutely necessarie for euery particular man and womā to know and beleeue them fide explicita,
                  Supra cap. 7. Num. 6. that is, by distinct and cleere belief, as before hath byn shewed, but that by a more general and ymplied faith, wherby we professe to beleue his holie catholike Churche, and all that shee teacheth and beleeueth, we include also these other pointes necessarie to our saluation. To which purpose Hosius hauing alleaged the saying of S. Clemens Alexandrinus & other fathers more auncient then S. Hillary he addeth these woordes:Hosius, lib. de fide & Symbolo c. 14. 
                  Et eos secutus Hilarius, habet (inquit) non tam veniam quam praemium ignorare quod credas, quia maximum fidei stipendium est, sperarequae nescias.
                  Hillar. lib. 8. de Trin. inetio. S. Hillary following the foresaid fathers saith, that to be ignorant of that thow beleuest is a matter woorthie not so much of pardō as reward, for that the greatest reward of faith is to hope for that which

thow knowest not: These are the woordes of that great and auncient Catholike doctor S. Hilary, whose name our Minister durst not cyte, but of purpose omitteth thesame and affirmeth most falsely that they are Hosius his woords. And this is one cosenage, let vs examyne an other.
               
                  
                  And in an other place (saith he) Hosius affirmeth that,
                  Tvvo nototorious Cosenages of O.E. nihil scire ijs, Omnia scire, to know nothing is to know all thinges: and that it is sufficient for a man to beleue that which the Cathol. Churche beleueth,
                  Pag. 42. 
                  albeit he be not able to shew what it beleueth. Here I say there is an other false deceitful shift, no lesse fraudulent and shameles then the former: for that these woords are not the woords of Hosius no more then the former,Hos. Ibid. but are only cited by hym, by name, and expresly out of 
                     
                        •
                     ertullian de praescript. Where after a long and learned discourse about the rule of faith instituted by Christ and his Apostles and left to the Churche to be deliuered vnto vs and to be conserued from tyme to tyme, Tertullian saith, that all good Catholike men ought to be content and acquiet their myndes with this rule & summe of faith left vnto vs, and not to be ouer curious in examyning, discussing or seeking further knowlege then is delyuered to them in this rule by their Catholike mother the Churche. Haec regula (saith he) à Christo instituta nullas habet apud no
                        •
                      quaestiones, nisi quas haereses inferunt,
                  Tertul. de praescript. cap. 14. 
                  & quae hareticos faciunt. This rule of faith instituted by Christ and deliuered to his Churche hath no doubt

or questiō among vs Catholykes but such as either heresyes do bring in, or do make heretikes: And then after a sharp reprehension against curious men,Tertullians reprehension of curious heretikes that brag of skil. and suche as vnder pretence of seeking knowlege are alwayes disputing in matters of faith, he concludeth thus. Nouissimè ignorare melius est,
                  Tertul. Ibid. 
                  ne quod non debeas, noris, quia quod debeas nosti, &c. Finally it is better to be ignorant in many things least yow should know that yow ought not to know, seing yow know already (by the rule of faith receiued) so muche as yow should know. And then further.Ibid. 
                  Cedat curiositas fidei, cedat gloria saluti, certe aut non obstrepant aut quiescant aduersus regulam, nihil vltra scire, omnia scire est, &c. Let curiositie of searching yeild vnto faith and beleuing: let the vayne glorie of disputing yeild vnto the studie of our saluation, and at leastwise either let them not brabble at all, or let them be sylent against this rule of faith receued, for to know nothing besydes this, is to know all thinges.
               Now let the sober reader iudge what honestie, wit or shame this Minister may haue in him,Illations against O.▪ E. that citeth these places owt of Hosius, to proue his purpose that we hold Ignorance to be the mother of deuotion: for first they are not the sentences of Hosius as now we haue shewed, but of S. Hillary and Tertullian: and secondly they doe make nothing to proue, that we hold ignorance to be the mother of deuotion, but rather that these fathers do hold it, if any suche things be in their sentences or tending that

way, which is muche against our Minister if yow mark it. But thirdly I say that all this is nothing to his purpose, but altogether to ours, for that these sayings of the fathers and many other that might be alleaged to thesame effect doe tend principally to reproue the curious searching disputing & wrangling of heretikes that brag of singular knowlege and do obiect ignorance and simplicity to Catholikes, which ignorance notwithstanding and simplicitie with promptnes of obeying and beleuing what is left vnto them by the Churche their mother, is preferred by the foresaid fathers before all the curiositie & knowlege vawnted of by heretikes,

                   And thus now as yow see hath the Kt. with his Minister struggled hard hitherto for deliuering himself frō the forged position fayned against vs,The Conclusion of this chapter. that we hold Ignora
                        •
                     ce for the mother of deuotion; albeit to the very force and substance of the Warders replie he hath answered scarse any one point at all to the purpose. For the Warder meaning to haue the truthe tried indeed substantially and reallie whither ignorance or sciēce were holden by Catholykes to be needful to deuotion, he took a sownd way & went roundly to the matter, setting downe the true definition of deuotion out of Catholyke Doctors, & namely out of S. Thomas in name of all the rest: which definition being the true touchstone of the nature of each thing, seing it excludeth ignorance expresly,

and requireth knowlege, doth cōuince Sir F. his fiction of forgery, and deliuereth all Catholykes from that fond imputation.
               Moreouer the Warder againe shewed at  large out of the said Author (S. Thomas) that albeit knowlege and contemplation of Gods benefits vnto vs be the true mother of deuotiō indeed, yet may it fal out oftentymes, that the most learned be not the most dedout; the cause wherof is, for that deuotion dependeth more of the affection then of the vnderstanding, and then he concludeth in these woords:
Thus yow see (S•. F.) that we hold not ignorance for the mother nor daughter nor kinswoman, of deuotion but rather to the cōtrary we hold that deuotion is fownded and proceedeth of knowlege, wherof Catholyks haue byn euer and in all ages more studious and greater enemies to ignorance then Protestants can with any reason presume to haue byn, for the litle tyme they haue byn in the world.
               
               And by this meanes the said Warder taketh an occasion to make a third discourse,Principal points of the VVarders discourse vntouched by the knight & Minister. and to shew by many profes and examples that Catholyks haue byn euer more greater furtherers of all kynd of learning, sciēce and knowlege belonging to piety, then Protestants, and namely of that wherof euery Sectarie of our tyme dothe brag, to wit, of holy scriptures, which is euident, by conseruing the same vncorrupt so many ages, wherby Sectaries of our tyme are come to haue thē, which otherwise they should not, and they are forced to

take them vpon our credit. And more then this, the Bybles set forth in our tymes in Hebrew, Greek Chaldy, Syriak and other learned tonges was done by our men, infinit commentaries also published vpon them, Vniuersities and Lectures erected by them for their study, Schoole degrees and preferments appointed for those that profit most in that study all which Catholyks would neuer haue done, if they had byn enemies of knowlege and specially of Scriptures.
               
                   And as for Christian knowlege and perpetual remembrāce of the misteries of our Sauiour especially in the lay people that can not read, nor vnderstand the Scriptures, no man can in reason denie but that Catholyks haue & do vse many meanes more then Protestants doe,More meanes to Christian knovvleg in vse amongst Catholyks then amongst Protestants. as the frequent vse of festiual and holie dayes, wherein the Acts of Christ and his Saincts are recownted, repeated and imprinted to the peoples myndes.
               The vse of Images, representations and many exterial ceremonies belonging to the same end: all which do contayne, renew and keep in memory the misteries of Christian faith amongst vnlearned people (which can not read or study bookes) more then any thing els, especially the Cath. expositions of their Pastors and teachers being adioyned therevnto, as before hath byn shewed to be ordeyned by our Churche: So as if all these things do tend to knowlege, yea a more certayn, sure and holsome knowlege

(conteyning the sense and true meaning of their mother the vniuersal Cath. Churche) then euery priuate man can pyke out of scriptures by his owne study or reading (though euery man and woman could read as they can not) or then they can take by the interpretation of any particuler Minister following lykewise his owne head, or of any particuler countrey or Prouince following their owne deuise, different from the whole body of Christendome: This I say being so, and so many wayes to knowlege vsed by vs, let euery indifferent man iudge, who may best brag of knowlege, or more obiect ignorance to others, notwithstanding the Kt. and Ministers babble to the contrarie. And with this we end our speeche of this first forged position obiected vnto vs.
            
            
               OF THE SECOND forged principle, that laymen must not medle in matters of religion; wherein is handled againe the matter of reading scriptures in English, and why the Catholyke Churche doth forbid some bookes & purge others. CAP. IX.
               THE second ground or position attributed  by Sir F. to Catholykes is set downe by him thus.VVatchvvoord. Pag. 20. 
                  VVhen they had (saith he) thus setled

this blynd course to keep the people from knowlege, &c. Then they offer an other position, that it was not for Laymen to medle with matters of religion,
                  The second fayued position. 
                  for that belōged onely and wholy as a priuilege to Priestes, thereby making them secure and carelesse of God and all godlynes. This is the position; wherevnto the Warder answereth in these woords:
In setting downe of this forged position by the knight there is some subteltie ioyned with impudency.VVachvvord pag. 20. For first in the former parte, where he saith we hold, that it is not for laymen to medle with religion, he subtelly leaueth doubtful this woord (medle) eyther to signifie that laymen must not determyne or defyne matters of religion, or els not to medle or care for them at all. In the former sense we graunt, that in Synods and councels where controuersies of faith are to be treated Bishops and cleargie men haue only authoritie to defyne and determyne. For that S. Paul saith,Act. 20. 
                     that they are appointed by the holie Ghost to gouerne the Churche, though before they do come to determyne, they do help themselues also in the searche of truth by the labors & learning of laymen, and take their iudgment, when they may giue light, as in all Councels is seene. But in the second sense, it is most impudent, that he inferreth, that hereby we would make laymen secure and carelesse of God and all godlines.
                  
               
               
                   This is the charge. How doth Sir F. defend himself now? stoutly no doubt, for he saith, it may be iustified in eyther sense. Wel then let vs examine it a litle in the second sense (for

in the first we striue not muche) how & with what face cā the K•. auerre againe that laymen are so barred by vs from medling in matters of religion, as therby, we make them secure and carelesse of God and all godlines? what proofes doth he bring now (think yow) for answering so notorious a charge? Yow shal heare his owne woords.Pag. 52. 
                  In the later sense (saith he) I need not labor any more for proof, then that before is set downe, touching your breeding of Gods children in blyndnes and ignorance, and with-holding the key of knowlege from them.
                  Very fond reasoning of the K
                        •
                     . Doe yow see what he bringeth? If the Kt. had talked of breeding yong geese, he could speak no more fondly then here he doth. And what I pray yow is his key of knowlege with-holden from the lay sorte? forsooth the reading of the English Byble from such as understand yt not. And how many apprentices and good wiues of London with others of other places haue opened so many dores of later yeares to disorders with this key, as neither their husbands nor Maisters nor Magistrate could or cā wel remedy? let puritanes brownists louing-families and other like be witnesses. And yet as though all stood in this point of reading English Bybles, he asketh vs very earnestly in the next woordes following.Pag. 52. 
                  And how wil yow haue them (lay people) medle with cr
                        •
                     are for that they know not? And then againe. How doe yow permit laymen thus to medle with matters of Religion, when as yow take from them the vse of scriptures? Did yow euer heare such demands? or did euer man deale with suche aduersaries?

is there no care of piety, God or godlines (for this is our question) but in suche only as read scriptures in English? What wil yow say to all those Protestants among yow who can not read nor haue tyme to heare them red, wil yow say there is no godlines or care of God in them? if yow do, I say, and yow can not deny it, that they are the greatest part of your English protestant people.
               
                   But from this he leapeth to two places of scriptures, the first out of the Acts of the Apostles of the men of Berraea, who are much commended (saith he) for searching the Scriptures, whether things were so as the Apostles had deliuered. The second out of S. Iohns Epistle saying, Dearly beloued beleue not euery spirit,
                  1 Ioan. 4. Examination of tvvo places of Scripture for vulgar reading therof. 
                  but t
                        •
                     ie spirits whether they be of God or not. Out of both which two places he would haue vs take it for proued, that all kynd of lay people, men and women, learned and vnlearned must searche scriptures dayly in the vulgar tonges, to examine and iudge whither their Pastors and teachers say truly or noe? And thereby also trie spirits: and that without this, there is no care of God or godlines in the lay sorte: euery man, woman and damozel must haue their key of knowlege to open scriptures and trie spirits.
               
                   But first what a common wealth this would make if it were wel executed all men can see: secondly the places of scriptures are as fitly alleaged as these men are wont to doe, as yow shal see by examination. For to the

first, of the men of Berraea (which euery where is alleaged and vrged by Protestants most impertinently to this effect) I would aske our Kt. how he can proue their case to be lyke ours? to wit, first that they were vnlearned and vulgar Iewes that searched those scriptures in Berraea, to see whether the places of the Prophets alleaged by Paul and Silas about Christ were so or no and secondly that those scriptures which they searched were in the vulgar Syriak tonge and not in the Hebrew, which the common people for the most part vnderstood not, and thirdly that this searching was a general promiscuous reading of all scriptures translated into vulgar languages for all sortes 
                     •
                  f people to read and examine therby their Priests & Pastors doctrine and to iudge therof, which three points the Kt. and his Minister wil neuer be able to proue, & so indeed do proue nothing in alleaging this place most impertinent to their purpose. For as for the case of the men of Berraea, it was a very particular and different yea extraordinary case, for that S. Paul and Silas were not the ordinary teachers & Pastors of those Iewes of Berraea, but taught rather a new and strange doctrine different in many substantial points (as appered) frō the auncient Religion of the Iewes and yet they alleaged the sayings and testimonies of the old Prophets and Patriarches for the same:Hovv the Ievves of Berraea did search the Scriptures. so as the learned sort of Iewes of Berraea had great reason to searche diligently 
                     •
                  hose places of scriptures to see whether they

were so as the Apostles alleaged and interpreted or no; and for that the controuersy was not so muche about the woords as the sense and interpretation, it is euident that they were of their learned men that took this searche in hand & not vulgar people, wherof our controuersy is, and so muche do the precedent woords of the text cleerly shew: if S. F. after his fraudulent manner had not cut them of and dissembled them, for thus saith the text of S. Luke.

E. and the rest. But now to the place it self.
               
                   He wil needs make S. Chrisostome to be of his opinion for permitting scriptures in vulgar languages to all sortes of people, and that they both learned and vnlearned must examine and discusse all their controuersies thereby. Heare his woords. S. Chrisostome (saith he) thinketh it an absurd thing that all men▪ should not thus medle with religion.
                  Pag. 53. 
                  Quomodo absurdum non est, &c. VVhat an absurdity is that: for money we trust not other men but count it and tel it after them,
                  Chris. in 2. Cor. hom. 13. 
                  but for more excellent things simply to follow other mens sayings, especially fith we haue the exactest rule and ballance of all the testimony of the Law of God, therfore I pray and beseech yow that yow wil leaue what this and that man thinketh, & enquire all things of the Scriptures.

Wher
                        •
                     ore I do pray & beseech yow all, that in these things yow wil not stand vpon, what this or that man thinketh, but that yow take counsel rather of holy scriptures, and learne by them which are true riches indeed.
               
               
                   Thus saith S. Chrisostome, and now let vs briefly examine how many wayes the K. hath peruerted this one place,The abuse offred by S. F. to 5. Chrysostome. to make it sound somewhat to his purpose, albeit not muche though it were as he alleageth it. But first of all he wresteth his whole meaning (as before I haue noted) which is the greatest sinne in alleaging any author that may be. For S. Chrysost. treateth a far differēt question from ours, to wit, of true and false riches, as in the title of the Chapter he professeth, and hauing handled it largely, he concludeth in those first woords by me alleaged, and gu
                     •
                  lfully cut of and left out by Sr. F. Quae cumita sint &c. which things being so let not vs follow the opinion of the vulgar sort (about true riches and pouerty) but let vs consider thinges 
                        ••
                      they be in thēselues, &c. which woords do wholy ouerthrow Sr. F. principal illation, that vnlearned people should not follow other mens opinions, to wit, their Pastors in matters of

religion, but go & try it in scriptures, wherof S. Chrysostome neuer so much as dreamed.
               Secondly the first woords alleaged by the  Kt. in Latyn Quomodo absurdum non est, &c. are  not so in S. Chrysostome as yow see by those which I haue alleaged, which is a token that he had them out of some Ministers notebook and read them not himself. Thirdly the woord  
                  praeposterum left out in his translation importeth some fraud also, for that this woord sheweth the comparison not to be betwene reading of scriptures & other mens testimonies, especially our ordinarie Cath. Pastors as he would haue it seme. Fourthly those other woordes. (But for more excellent thinges simplie to  follow other mens sayinges) are not in the text as yow may see by comparing it, but are deceitfully layd together to make men think that simple obedience or belief of our teachers in Gods Churche is here reprehēded by S. Chrisostome, and that euery man and woman is willed to go to the scriptures. And for this cause fifthly he translateth those woordes diuinarum  legum sententiam the testimony of the law of God: where as the sentence or determination of these deuine lawes heere spoken of by S. Chrysostome, as they be conteyned partly in scriptures and partly in the traditiō of Gods Churche, which was before scriptures were written, so is it not necessary for euery man and woman to be remitted to reading of scriptures for learning them as heer, is pretended.
               
                  
                   It followeth sixtly in S. Chrysostome. 
                  VVherfore I pray and besech yow all, that in these things yow wil not stand vpon what this or that man thinketh, &c. Which woords Sr. F. translateth thus: I pray and besech yow that yow wil leaue what this or that man thinketh, &c. leauing out of purpose the woords that make most to the matters de hijs rebus, of these things, to wit, of true and false riches, which is the subiect handled by S. Chrysostome. And Sr. F. would haue his reader
                     •
                   thinke (though neuer so vnlearned) that he is prayed in all matters of Religion to leaue what this or that man thinketh (though it be his Pastor or any other Cath. teacher) and enquire all those things of the scriptures which is most absurd and furthest from S. Chrysostom
                     •
                   meaning: And in these very last woordes of the Kt. there be two or three shift
                     •
                  s and manifest corruptions: for where as S.  Chrysostome sayth: Scripturas sacras de eis consulatis, he translateth it, and enquire all these things of the scriptures, adding the woord (all) of purpose to disguise the meaning of S. Chrysostome, as though he would haue all matters by euery man and woman imediatly searched out from the scriptures, & as though he had not handled a particuler argument, for which the scriptures were to be consulted against the vayne opiniō of vulgar men about  true and false riches, for which cause the Kt. cutteth of also the next imediat woords following in the self same sentēce for explication of S. Chrysostoms meaning ac quae verae sint opes

cognoscatis, and that yow may knowe which are true riches.
               And thus I haue byn longer then I thought  to be in notifying vnto yow this maner of dealing of S.F. and his Minister (as in the precedent Chapter yow haue sene also about the handling of Hosius) when they cite any Fathers or Authors of moment against vs, which commonly is with such fraud and deceit, corruption and mangling, as if the controuersy were for mens shuwes & not soules, or for shuw-soles, or as if it were for some tēporal and earthly tryfles, and not for the euerlasting possession of hel or heauen. But let vs see more of this kind of proceeding in the Kt. It is re
                        •
                     orded (saith he) that some of the learneder sort of your Cleargie haue vsed to say among their friends:
                  Pag 54. Paralip. Abb. vrspergen. Pag 448. 
                  Sic dicerem in Scholis. Sed tamen (manet in

                     er nos, &c.) I would say so in the Scholes, but yet (let it be kept secret amongst our selues,) I think the contrary.
               
               These woords I do not fynd in the Author by him alleaged cited in the margyn, and therfore God knoweth from what forge they come, perhaps by some Ministers notebook, that eyther deuised or corrupted them in cyting. But suppose they may be found, and that some Schole readers in matters eyther of philosophie or diuinity (for he specifieth no science) not belonging to any article of faith should say thus,Impertinent matter brought in. that in the schooles for not offending any part, he would follow the cōmon opinions of that vniuersity of schole, though in priuat for himself he were of an other opinion, what doth this proue? or to what end

was this brought forth by the Kt. to confirme his principal propositiō, that we forbid laymē to medle in matters of religion? do yow see what direct proofes they bring.
               
                   But harken yet further to another charge immediatly following more heynous then this: The Fathers (sayth he) yow haue mangled and depraued where their testimonies were pregnant against your errors,

For who would publish books and expurgatorie Indices in all countreys of such corrections as we think needful, yf we would haue the matter secret, but these men must needs say somwhat though neuer so fond or repugnant to reason.
               
                   But for that of later dayes, diuers sectaries haue begonne to complayn greatly of the continuance of an ancient diligence vsed by

the Cath. Roman Churche for repressing heretical books and purging others corrupted by them, with infinite impostures, false translations, wicked annotations, pernicious commentaries postiles, arguments, obseruations, and other like most pestilent infections, I shal be forced in this place to stand vpō this matter somwhat, and to open to the reader the truth of things about this point, and then shal we answere also this particular obiection, of deleaiur solummodo made heere by Sr. Francis, & els where by many of his cōparteners as though we meant to blot out, all that is against vs in any sort of authors whatsoeuer.
               First then it is to be vnderstood, that it hath  byn an ould custome of heretiks and sectaries from the beginning not only to wryte wicked bookes themselues,The custome of heretiks to corrupt bookes. but to corrupt other mēnes wrytings also most audaciously, to make them seeme to be of their secte and faction, euen as rebels are wont to do, who being but few at the beginning, do giue out notwithstanding for their better credit, that they haue many & great parteners in secret, and do oftentymes fayn letters to testifie the same.
               
               Of this fraud of heretiks,Origenes in epist. ad Alexandrinos. Tertul. lib. contra Marcion. Euseb. Caesar. in apol. sub. nomine Pamphy

                   But now to this most dangerous assault of the diuel,

                   For what is become (I pray yow) of all those volumes written by the Arrians, which did set a worke all the Cath. Fathers and Doctors of diuers ages to answere them? what is become of the many books of Pelagius our learned (though wicked) Brittaine? of Faustus the great Manichie, of whose great parts and labors S. Augustine himself that was, his

greatest aduersary doth beare witnesse? of Petilian, Crescentius, and other wryting Donatists? What is become of the 200. books or volumes of our Ihon VVicliffe or wicked-beleef as Thomas VValsingham calleth him? are they not all gon? So as yf our other learned contreyman Thomas VValden VVicliffes opposite, and some others did not make mention therof, and of that nūber, we should neuer haue knowne that he had wrytten so many to his owne confusion.
               Wel then these are the effects of this holy  industry of the Catholyke Church in cēsuring and condemning the wrytings of heretyks, which censure though it be commonly litle esteemed, but rather contemned by them and their followers for the tyme present, yet as the figtree in the ghospel died and withered away after the curse of Christ receyued so do these men and their works by litle and litle dy in themselues after the malediction and condemnation of his spouse the Churche, though presently it be not seene, but future tymes wil declare it, and if we haue seene the experience therof in 15. ages past, we may beleeue it also of this, which is the 16. Let the heretiks vaunt and brag what they wil to the contrary, and already we see some proof therof. For I would aske yow, who readeth or esteemeth greatly Martyn Luthers works at this day in England (I meane of Protestants) though they were more perhaps in number then those of S.

                   And thus much of the effects of this diligence as also of the necessary causes inducing to vse the same, which may be greatly confirmed by the cōtrary effects to be seene amōg heretyks and sectaries where this diligence is not, or cannot be vsed, nor if it were, can it haue the forsayd benediction of good successe, for that God the giuer of that benediction is not with them; & so we see that among them all sectaries books whatsoeuer are read promiscuously of all men and women, euen the Turks Alcaron it self, Macheuile & Bodin tending to Atheisme, and baudy Boccace, with the most pestilent English Pallace of Pleasure (all forbidden among vs Catholyks) are read and studied by whome it lyketh them, wherby it must needs ensue, that the peoples iudgment & affections are pittifully infected with poyson in euery kynd where no prohibition is vsed to the contrary.
               
                   The only diligence that is vsed at this day

among them is to prohibit and keep out Catholyke books,No bookes prohibited amongst protestants but Catholyke. which only do contayne indeed the true medicines for these maladies, and yet is this a hard matter to do, considering the variety, vtility, and necessity of such books, insomuch that yf they exclude not all good sciēces, and togeather with them the ancient Fathers, Councels and Ecclesiastical histories themselues, and more then this destroy not many monuments of their owne, they cannot exclude the arguments persuading people to the truthe of Catholyke religion.
               And this being so let vs se now a litle what  maner of diligēce the catholyke Churche doth vse in repressing heretical books and purging other by heretiks infected.Diligence of the Catholyk Church in prohibiting and purging bookes. The late vniuersal and Oecumenical Coūcel of Trent preceyuing the infinite multitude and variety of heretical wrytings that were come forth already and came forth dayly of all new sects as Lutherans, Zwinglians, Anabaptists, Caluinists, Swinkefeldians, Libertines, Trinitarians, new Arrians; and others, to infect the world withal,Index expurgar.

Christ 1515. (which was 2. yeares before Luther published his heresy) should be vnderstood also to be forbidden and condemned by them; by which we may see, that one councel in the Cath. Churche hath relation to another and confirmeth the same, which heretyks vse not to do in their assemblyes & meetings.

before mētioned, to wit that eyther they fynd it thrust in by heretiks, or by error of the printer, and that other more auncient and corrected coppyes had it not, and so might they say also of the former sentēce alleadged by Syr F. deleatur dictio solummodo, especially seing they do censure the sentence, not as a sentence of Gregory Nissene (as falsely and fraudulētly Syr F. doth set it downe) but of a farre later greeke author named Antonius Abbas of whome they say thus in their Index:Index expurgat.

men of Spayne censure him or speak of him, but only of these sermons of Antonius Abbas, in which many other things are found worthy reprehension as this Index doth shew, & Protestāts themselues wil not deny, as for exāple, where they say:Serm. 72. col. 73. Serm. 26. col.

How then followeth the second part; that therby we make all laymen carelesse of God and all godlynes? and how doth the Kt. himself go about to defend it by saying, that we barre

Yow se how liberal this gentleman is in canonizing, that requireth no more perfection, but once a yeare to go to masse and confession, and then he addeth: Of this we haue example of Tho. Becket in K. Henry the 3. his tyme, whose treason to the Prince was apparant and manifest, &c.
               
               Thus saith he in his Watchword, wherin the Warder tooke him vp for diuers vntruthes and absurdities as namely for saying that we hold it for sufficient perfection of holines, to heare masse and confesse once a yeare, and that a man may be a Saint▪ with vs yea canonized though he be taynted with the grossest sinnes that may be: That S.

omit the rest) about the tyme of the death,A grosse error About the tyme of S Thomas his death. and canonization of S. Thomas vnder K. Henry the third (as this man saith) and not the second, is shewed not only to be false, but of grosse ignorance also, seing that K. Henry the 3. nephew to the second was borne more then 30. yeares after the death and canonization of S. Thomas, to which represension of error in story I do not fynd that S. F. giueth any reason of iust excuse in this his reply now, nor yet O. E. for him, but rather as though nothing had byn said against him for it turneth to repeat againe the same error vnder pretence of a namelesse author, though in the manner of telling his tale he would couertly seeme somwhat to answere the obiection, for thus he wryteth:

But this being so notorious an vntruth (if he meane of his canonization as by his former woords in the Watch word may appeare) & he being reprehended for it before (as yow haue heard) for modesties sake should at least haue named his author for some shew or defence. For if it be Iohn Fox, or some such other of as light credit as himself, you see what cogging it is one of them to aleadge another, especially seing

                  Fox also citeth the same woords, with the same parenthesis (to vse the words of my author) but neyther the one or the other citeth any author at all. And most certayne it is that neuer any author of credit in the world said or wrote that S. Thomas eyther practised treason or was made a saint in K. Henry the 3. his tyme, as in the former woords of his watch our knight affirmed, for that his conten

And the poore shift which heere the knight runneth vnto for saluing of his former error (to wit that S. Thomas his body was translated,Se Math. Paris and Matth VVest. an. Dn̄i 1220.

               Let them read but Iohn Stow in the 25. yeare of K. Henry the 2. his raigne, which was of our Lord 1179. and 41. before the translation of S. Thomas his body mentioned heere by them and they shal find that both the s

Thomas his Tombe and offered rich Iewels for their deuotion being but 8. yeares after his death which happened in the yeare 1171. So as herby is seene that he was canonized vnder K. Henry the 2. and not the third. To which effect also and for cleering this whole story let the ancient authentical authors be read which liued with S. Thomas or presently after him as for example those fiue that wrote his whole lyfe, actions and death,The authentical authors of the story of S. Tho. of Canterburie. to wit: Herbert Hoscan afterwards Cardinal, Iohn Salisbury bishop of Charters, Allen Abbot of Teukesbury, VVilliam and Edward monks of Canterbury, all which liued with him, as did also Peter of Blois Archdeacō of VVels. And soone after vnder K. Richard the first, sonne to K. Henry the second, wrote Roger Houeden doctor and cheef reader of diuinity in Oxford the whole life of S. Thomas, as is extant in his story, and so did Nubergensis also handle thesame at the same tyme, and so consequently after these, Mathew Paris, Mathew

of VVestminster, Thom. VValsingam, Polidor Virgil, and others downewards in their histories, all which do agree in this point against Sir Francis. First that S. Thomas was slayne and canonized vnder Pope Alexander the 3. and K. Henry the second, and not vnder Henry the 3. his nephew, and secondly that he was a most holy man of lyfe, euen setting the priuiledge of his martyrdome a side, and neyther taynted with grosse sinnes as these grosse tongues do slaunder him nor comitted euer any point of treason against his king, but as primate and head of the English Churche stood for the Ecclesiastical libertyes therof as in conscience he was bound, and by the issue of this my reioynder shal appeare.
               
                   Wherin first I must note vnto yow that the knight in the beginning of the combat about S. Thomas of Canterbury doth complayne that I in my former answere seemed to threaten, that they who striued against Saynts would remayne in the end with broken heads and that in some place I speak of bastinados, but all this is but picked matter by him to make a quarrel for wel he knoweth, that this is not to be vnderstood but figuratiuely, and that we are not to enter bataile or to stand with so puissant a knight in material armes. Wherfore the bastinados or broken heads which I say he is like to gaine by fighting with saints is in his credit and reputation with men,VVhat bastinados and brokē heads are threatned to S. F. and in his demerit also with God, if he esteeme that any thing, as it is like inough

he doth, but litle. But for the first about discredit I do remit it to the iudgment of the indifferent reader, what men wil or may think o

                   the honour of such a knight, as is not ashamed to come foorth in print with so many op probrious speeches, made out (as it seemeth) of his fingers ends against so honorable a personage as S. Thomas of Canterbury was, whilst he liued, and so highly praysed and esteemed by all wryters for 4. hundred yeares after his death, and this without alleadging any one author old or new, good or bad, credible or without credit for proof of that which he wryteth: For so doth S. F. deale with, vs in his rayling narration against S. Thomas, setting downe as he pretendeth the whole substance of that whieh passed betweene him & the King without cyting book or author, and quite contrary to all that (for the most part) which all ancient wryters that liued with him haue left behind them wrytten of this affayre; and moreouer hath corrupted (which is farre worse) and falsified also witingly and willingly diuers things which he found in other authors,False dealing of S. Francis. therby to make them seeme somwhat to his purpose: all which yow shal see euidently proued in this examination of the two foresaid points, to wit of his lyfe & cōtention with the King.
               And for the first about his lyfe and conuersation, whatsoeuer S.F. tatleth of grosse sinnes here or els where, most certayne and cleere it is, that all the foresaid ancient authors, and

                   Mark Iohn Fox his exception (if the histories be true) & why should he cal in doubt auncient histories, more in this point, then in others? But yow must vnderstand that this Fox hauing a special spite against this blessed man, & being desirous by all meanes possible to disgrace him and his actions in his false lying martyrologe, and finding no authors in the world before Luthers heresy to serue his purpose or to speak or wryte euil of him, but all rather highly in his commendation, what course taketh the miseriable man think yow? truly a most desperate, which is to vse these authors against themselues and against both their owne sayings and meanings and so patcheth he vp, as it were out of them a long treatese and narration of aboue 40. pages of paper against S. Tho. pretending to take it out of the foresaid authors, but yet spicing it with so

                     e dealing against S. Thomas. & adioyning so many glosses, parentheses, notes, obseruations, interpretations, commentaries and censures of his owne both in the text and margent, as he maketh all those wryters to tel a quite contrary story to that they purposed, and for which they wrote their books, in such sort, as if a man should set out the byble or new Testament it self with such corruption and peruersion it would more disgrace Christian religion (for whose confirmation it was wrytten) thē any other wicked book whatsoeuer, yea then the Turks Alcaron it self.
               And this is the dealing of Iohn Fox in cyting  and corrupting authors, as after shal appeare more particularly. But Sir Francis taketh another course which is to tel his tale at his pleasure, without cyting any testimony or author at all, wherof I take the reason to be that which Iohn Fox telleth vs in these words plainly:
                     Iohn Fox discrediteth all ould vvryters.
                     Pag. 204. col. 1. n. 4.
                   
                  Scarse any testimony is to be taken of that age, being all blynded and corrupted with superstition. Thus he saith and this is the cause why Sir F. alleageth no author, and Fox forceth them to speake as he would haue them. But I would aske Iohn Fox againe, if no wryter of the age it self wherin S. Tho. liued be to be credited about his affaires, how shal we beleeue wryters of later ages that must needs take it from the former, if they write with foundation & not deuise matter of themselues? Againe, I would aske whether it be probable that so great a king as K. Henry the second was,

could get no man to wryte the Story indifferently for him in his age? How likely a fiction is this of Fox? And this may be sufficient for the first point; for seing all the foresaid wryters and their woorks are ful of high prayses of S. Thom. for his sanctity and perfection of lyfe, and for that cause are specialy discredited heere by Iohn Fox it shalbe sufficient to remit the reader in this behalf to thesaid volumes and wrytings before mentioned.
               
                   For the second which is his cause with the king whether his resisting as Primate of England for liberty to the English Churche were treason to the K. or no,VVhether S. Thom. vvas a traitor. is easy to be iudged by him, that is not passionate, and wil without flattery of temporal Princes consider indifferently, the dignity, preheminence, duty, and obligation of Ecclesiastical gouernours in this behalf, for defence of their spiritual iurisdiction; To which purpose the Warder said as followeth:
               
                  
                  If in euery contention or dissention, that a bishop,VVard. p. 22. priest, or other spiritual subiect or Ecclesiastical Prelate may haue with his temporal prince,That all spiritual men resisting temporal magistrats in Ecclesiastical matters are not traytors. Marc. 18. the subiect shal presently be condemned of treason (according to this seruile cēsure of our knight who for flattering princes doth make them absolute lords both of body and soule) then Iohn Baptist also must be accompted a traitor that dealt so peremptorily with his king Herod his liege lord in temporal affaires. Or yf yow wil haue examples of christian princes, S. Ambrose must be a traytor,

                     S. Hilarius also and S. Athanasius shalbe traytors for their contentions with Constantius their lawful Emperor and temporal lord who banished them from their bishopricks, and the former of the two wrote two vehemēt books and inuectiues against thesaid Emperor, and yet no man euer accompted him a traytor for thesame, but rather a great Saynt, for his christian liberty and constancy.
               
               
                  
                     S. Chrysostome in like maner shalbe condemned  for a great traytor who had greater contentions with his temporal lords Arcadius and Honorius christian Emperors,Socrat. lib. 6. cap. 16. and with their wiues Theodosia and Eudoxia then euer S. Thomas had with K. Henry the second:Zozom lib. 8 cap. 17.
for he preached against them publikely with great vehemency and thundered out excommunication against them,Niceph. li. 14. cap. 43. and was twice banished and dryuen out of his bishoprick by their disfauours, and died in exile. And yet was he neuer called or accompted a traytor, but a singular holy man: and Theodosius the yonger, sonne of Arcadius, brought his body with great solemnity honor and reuerence into Constantinople, and wept most bitterly for the synnes of his parents in persecuting so blessed a man, & (as the Story saith) made prayer to him now dead for pardon of his fathers synnes; as did also often

both our K. Henry the second himself and his sonne for the offence of his father,Math. Parisien in vit. Henr. who had ben some cause of the death of this iust man his pastor and spiritual father.
               
               
                   Thus wrote the Warder then, and what replyeth now our knight or his minister to all this? yow shal heare the knight in his owne woords: VVho (saith he) but such a one as hath sold himself to all impudency and shamelesse gaynsaying the truth,Pag. 54. would seek to couer Beckets rebellion by the facts of S. Iohn Baptist, Ambrose, Hilary, Athanasius, and Chrysostome, which haue as much agreement with the cause of Becket, as hath light with darknesse, good with euil, sweet with sower. Heer yow se the knight in a great heat, but his minister O. E. answereth somwhat more temperately saying only, that These examples fit not Thomas Becke

                     s cause. Wel then of two poynts contayned in this matter, the one we haue gotten that in some cases, spiritual prelates, though subiects in temporalityes may reprehend and resist, yea chasten also by Ecclesiastical punishment their liege lords and temporal princes without being traytors for the same. The second whether the examples be like, we are to examine a litle in this place.
               
                   And first I would aske our minister that denyeth the fitnes of the examples,The comparison of S. Thom vvith S. Ambrose, Hillary and other fathers. as also his master that chafeth at them. what and where about were the foresayd Saints contentions with their temporal Princes, were they not for the defence of the lawes of Christ and his Churche, did not S. Iohn Baptist withstand

Herod his temporal Lord to his face for breaking the lawes of wedlock and was not the strife of S. Ambrose with Valentinian his Emperour first for that he would not deliuer vp a Catholike Churche to the vse of Arrians as he and his mother had commaunded, and secondly for that he would not giue vp the treasure and vessels of his Churche into the Emperors owne hands as he required. Heare his owne testimony thereof.S. Ambr. in orat. in Auxō. de Basilicia traden. 
                  Cum esset propositū

If any thing of my owne were demaunded, eyther land howse gold or siluer I would easely yeild vnto him any thing that were belonging vnto mee. But from the Churche of God I told him that I could take nothing, for that I had receyued it not to deliuer but to keep. And that with this I had respect also of the Emperours saluation. For that it was neyther expedient for mee to giue, nor for him to receyue. Accipiat ergo vocem liberi sacerdotis, &c. Let his Maiestie then receyue the word of a free priest if he wil haue care of his owne saluation, let him cease to offer iniury to Christ.
               
               Lo here the answeare of an ecclesiastical  Prelate but a temporal subiect to his highest Prince, doth not this seeme to bee speach of some Catholyke Bishop to a Protestant Prince that would inuade Churche goods & possessions against which poynt S. Ambrose was so resolute to stand as he sayth in the same place: that yf sorce were vsed towards him his flesh might

bee troubled but not his mynd, and that he was readie yf the Emperour would vse his kingly authority in offring violence to stuffer that which belonged to a good Priest to beare. And what doth this differ now from the cause of S. Tho. of Canterbury who stood vpon defence of his Ecclesiastical iurisdictiō against K. Henry his temporal Prince that vsurped the same. Heare the words of S. Thomas himself vsed to K. Henry in a Coūcel at Chynon in Frāce as D. Houeden sets them downe:Rog. Houe in vit. Henr. 2. pag. 285.

                        •
                     . Or is not this agreable to the speach of S. Ambrose to Valentinian that he could not force him to deliuer any churche or holy vessels thereof, and that he would dy in that quarrel against him.
               
                   But let vs heare an other controuersy of his with another Emperour more deuout & religious then the former,The contention of S. Ambrose vvith Theodosius the Emperor. to wit: Theodosius the great in Millain for that he would not do

publike pennance prescribed by this holy B. to him for the excesse in punishing those of Thessalonica, and had not this beene rebelliō and treason by Protestants law for a priest to driue his king and Emperour (that by their diuinity was head of their churche) to publike penance and to go out of his Churche as S. Ambose did compel Theodosius to go out of the churche of Millan. But let vs go forward and see the rest of examples before touched,Pallad. in vit. Chrysost. was not the contention of S. Chrisostome with Arcadius and Honorius his Princes & Emperours and with their wyues when he kept some of them by force out of his churche about ecclesiastical liberty and iurisdiction also. And that also of S. Athanasius & Hilarius against Constantius their Emperour and supreme head also according to the Protestants opinion in spiritual matters, for that he fauored Arrians, deposed Catholike Bishops and made himself vmpyre in ecclesiastical affayres as Protestants Princes doe now a dayes. Did S. Tho. Primate of England say or write more to K. Henry at any tyme then S. Gregorie Nazianzen a particular Archbishop sayd vnto his Emperour that was present and angry with him.Nazian. orat. ad Ciues & Imper.

Yow also (o Emperour) the law of Christ hath made subiect vnto my power, and to my tribunal. I know thee to bee a sheep of my flock, a sacred sheep of a holy flock. If Nazianzene had sayd

this to an English King or should doe at this day, how would our Protestants Prince-parasytes cry out and say that he were a proud Prelate as they say of S. Thomas.
               
                   The cheif and onelie contention of king Henry with the Archbishop as before in part you haue heard was about ecclesiastical iurisdiction as the articles set downe by all wryters doe testify,The articles vpon vvhich S. Tho. disagreed vvith the king. as namely, that no Bishop might appeale to the Sea Apostolike without licence of the king that no seruant or tenant holding of the king might be excommunicated without his licence, that no Bishop should bee able to punish any man for periury or breaking his faith, that all cleargie men might bee forced to secular iudgments as all controuersyes also pert
                        •
                     yning to tythes and other like cases. And now yf these controuersyes should haue fallen out as in part they did betweene the auncient christian Emperours and the holy Bishops before named would they not think you haue stood in them with no lesse feruour then S. Thomas did.
               
                   But now let vs heare and examine how Syr F. doth proue this holy Archbishop to bee a traytor. Thus he writeth of the beginning of the controuersy. There was (as authors doe affirme) in that time of Henrie the second,
                  Pag 56. 
                  more then a hundred murthers besydes other felonyes proued vpon the cleargie which when the king would haue punished according to the lawes of the land,

                     . 
                  Becket opposed himself and beardeth the king in this so iust an action, vnder title of standing for the libertyes of the Churche & from this straūge ground these proceedings

ensued. In which words of the knight there is to bee noted first that where he saith: authors doe affirmè that more then a hundred murders besides other 
                        •
                     ellonies were proued vpon the cleargie: no other author is found to mention any such thing but onelie Nubergensis who yet doth not say that they were proued vpon the clergie, but his words are:Nuberg hist. Angl. l. 2 16. 
                  that it was said to haue byn tould the king at a certaine time that aboue a hundred murders had byn committed within the kingdome of England since his raigne, by Cleargie men.
               
               In which woords as you see Nubergēsis doth  not say, that it was true, or that it was proued, as our knight doth: and secondly he speaketh of the whole tyme of king Henries raigne, vntil this contention, which was some 14. or 15. yeares: and thirdly the falling out of the Archbishop with the king was not for that he would not haue these clergie men punished if they had offended (as wickedly this knight giueth to vnderstand, saying presently after; This proud prelate durst protect fellons and murderers against the king and iustice of the lan

                  ) but the controuersy was only about the maner of punishing those that did offend, and by what iudges and iurisdiction they should be punished, to wit whether by ecclesiastical or temporal power, for that the Archbishop affirmed that equity required that clergie men offending should first be iudged condemned and degraded by ecclesiastical power according both to the cannon lawes as also the municipal lawes of the land confirmed by all

former Christian Kings 
                     •

And no lesse was this law of the realme of England confirmed by ancient parliaments and other antiquities then were the secular lawes, for which Sr. F. standeth, and fondly calleth the defence of eccles. lawes treason and rebellion.
               
                   Wherfore hauing set downe so false a relation of the beginning of this controuersy (falsifying Nubergēsis, as yow see, in many points) he doth prosecute the same with lyke vntruth, as presently yow shal see. And first he beginneth with a certayne letter of Maud the Empresse vnto the Archbishop which she wrote at the instance of the King her sonne, and vpō the informatiō of such courtyers as were contrary to the Bishop and his cause. In which letters she chargeth him, that (to vse S•. F. owne words) as much as in him lay, he went about to disinherit the King and depriue him of his crowne. Whervnto I answere, that truth it is, Iohn Fox hath such a letter of thesaid Empresse Maud without telling where,Pag 
                        •
                     8. or whence, or how he had it, or where we may read it, for

in none of all the authors aboue mentioned I do fynd it. Yet one thing I would haue the reader to note,S. F vntrue dealing in cyting matters, against S. Thom. which testifieth the continuance of Sr. F. vntrue dealing in this affayre, that wheras in Iohn Fox the whole charge of the empresse against the Archbishop is mitigated by this parēthesius (as the report is) which sheweth that these were but suspitions only and reports of his enimies;Fox Pag. 201. Sr. F. hath left out the parenthesis (as the report is) as though she had charged him vpon her owne knowledge, which is no true dealing or right meaning as yow see.
               But let vs heare further Sr. F. his words pretending  a more certayne proof, of treason & rebellion in S. Thomas:Pag. 58. 
                  But if the Empresse (saith he) might be thought to speak partialy on the K. her sonnes behalf, yet the two Card. sent by the Pope to heare all this controuersy, out of question wil not condemne him without iust cause, and yet in a letter sent from them to the Pope, they do condemne him, &c. Yf S. F. proue himself a true K•. in verifying this one poynt which here he sayth, I am to pardon much of that which hath passed before: But yf in this matter of so great moment he be taken in lyke falshood, who wil then trust him hereafter? Let vs examine then the matter & I wil haue none other euidēces or witnesses but his owne woords: for presently after he setteth downe a part of the letter of VVilliam and Otho. Card. sent by Pope Alexander to heare the cause betwene the King & the Archbishop and hauing trauayled therin, the King being

in Normandie and the Archb. at Paris, they found the matter more hard then they imagined to compoūd,False dealing of Syr Fraunces. for that the Archbishop demaunded restitution to his lyuings for himself and for his frends, and reuocation of certayne lawes lately made, preiudicial to ecclesiastical iurisdiction, before he could end the matter wherwith the-sayd Card. being somwhat displeased, for that they desired to carry with them to the Pope the glory of this accord made by them, and for that the King had much gayned their good wil by liberallity towards thē; for these causes they wrote to the Pope somwhat fauorably in the Kings behalf, but yet nothing condemning the Archbishop as vntruly out K•. doth auow, which now I shal shew out of the woords of their owne letter alleaged heere by S.F. which are these.

These are the words of the Card. by S. F. relation, which supposing they were truly alleaged, yet he that shal consider and ponder them wel, wil see that out of them no more can be vrged against

the Archbishop, but that the King and those about him did say, that the Archbishop had styrred vp the K. of Fraunce and the Earle of Flanders against them, and that this was held by them for most certayne vppon diuers euidences. But what these euidences were none of them do set down.
               So that heere is no condemnation at all  from the Card▪ themselues, but only that they relate what the King and his part sayd, and yet yow must note that S. Francis (besydes other euil translation of the words) hath wilfully corrupted the last clause of all to make it seeme as though it proceeded from the Card. iudgment, to wit,Quadrileg. de vita B. Thom. lib. 5. cap. venientes. 
                  as is by diuers euidences most certayn, wheras in latyn after the first words: Asserebat Rex & sucrum pars, &c. The king with the greater part of his affirmed that the Archbishop had done this &c.) yt followeth, Sicut sibi pro ce

                  False dealing of Syr Francis. to them & signes: For that by the first yt was euident that this was spoken in the name of the King and his frends and not of the Card. and by the second appeareth that the euidence which the King and his had of this matter and accusation was founded only in signes and coniectures: which being euident to our K•. he did not only stryke out the sayd words, but maketh also a seuere inference vpon the rest, that are left mangled by him self, as yow haue seene: his inference

is this:Pag. Ibid. 
                  Now (sayth he) for a subiect to styrre vp forrein states to make warre vpon his soueraygne, and countrey, was at all tymes high treason: but that Becket did so by the Card confession, was by diuers euidences most certayne. Therfore Becket, not now his enemies, but his brethren the sonnes of his owne mother being iudges, was a traytor.
               
               
                   Lo heer the inuincible argument of our learned knight: yf any man can trust him hereafter vpon his woords, I shal much maruaile seing him so shamelesse in a matter so euidēt. For who discouereth not the impudency of his second proposition, when he sayeth that Becket did so by the Card. confession, wh
                     •
                  ras the Card. confesse no such thing, but only say that the king and his people did affirme it; nether did the Card. say as our Kt. falsly chargeth them, that the matter was certayne to them by diuers euidences, but only that the king sayd yt was certayn or seemed so to him by diuers euident signes and coniectures. Shamefully then hath our Kt. abused the authority of these Card. as he doth comonly all authors that come through his hāds. And with this I end this controuersy of S. Thomas his cause with the King: which cause whatsoeuer the Kt. tatleth to the cōtrary yet was yt neuer accoūpted treason or named so by any author that wrote in that tyme, eyther frend or foe, nor shal S. F. be able to alleadge me any one instance to the contrary before Luthers dayes.
               
                   And as for the King himself though he pursued him eagerly, for that he would not yeild

to his desyre touching Eccles. iurisdiction, yet neuer is it read that he euer called or coūpted him for a traytor, nor any forrayne Prince whatsoeuer. And within 8. yeares after his death (as before I noted) both he, and Lewes the K. of Fraunce went in Pilgrimage to his tombe at Canterbury, which is lykely they would not haue done, nether the one nor the other, yf they had reputed him for a traytor. Iohn Stow putteth downe the relation thus. The 27. of August both the Kings came to Canterbury,
                  Stovv anno Domini 1179 reg Hent. 21. 25. 
                  where they were with due honor receaued, &c. Lewes K. of France offered vpon the tombe and to the shryne of Thomas Becket a riche cup of gold: he gaue also that renowned pretious stone▪ that was called the regal of France, which K. Henry the 8. put afterwards in a ring, & wore yt on his thombe, &c.
               
               Thus saith Stow out of other authors. And  whether king Lewes of France would haue taken a iorney into England to the shryne of a man that he knew, and had talked withal few yeares before, and would haue offered such pretious gyfts, yf he had suspected him for a traytor, or that his miracles had byn faynd as after Sir F. affirmeth; and whether king Henry himself being no way forced therunto wold haue accompained him in such an action to his owne disgrace (who commonly was reputed to haue byn the cause of his death) yf he had held him for a traytor, let euery man iudge. And so we shal passe from his point to another about his miracles

wherin the cauillers shew themselues more vayne, conscienslesse and malitious (yf it may be) then in the former.
            
            
               OF S. THOMAS HIS myracles, and what may be thought of them, and other such lyke, with the malitious corruption and falshood vsed by Iohn Fox and S. F. to discredit them. There is handled also the different manner of Canonising sainctes in their and our Churche. CAP. XI.
               
                   AMONG many other arguments that I vsed in the VVardword for the holynes of this Archbishop (to all which this VVastword answereth no one word at all) I said also that many miracles haue byn recorded by graue authors and publike testimony of the whole Iland,
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      3. and of forraine wryters to haue byn wrought by God at his sepulcher and otherwise by his intercession in witnes of his sanctity. Vpon which words Syr F. taketh occasion (with his heretical spirit of incredulity) to iest and blaspheme at all miracles of Popemade Saints (for that is his cōtumelious terme) but with what reason, truth, prudēce or piety we shal somwhat here examine by this occasion, noting first two poynts to this purpose.
               
                  The first, that the miracles of S. Thomas  dōne presently after his death had a circūstāce annexed vnto them,Tvvo especial confiderations in the miracles of S. Thom. which greatly confirmeth their certainty, to wit, that they brought with them the publike reproof of one of the greatest kings that day in Christendome (if not the greatest of all) which was king Henry the second, by whose fault he was put to death & who laboured with all his power for auoyding that infamy eyther to suppresse or improue the miracles that fel out. And who knoweth not what the force and fauour of such a Prince may do in such a cause, and yet was the multitude and euidency of S. Thom. his miracles, such, as they brake through all obstacles that the king could put against them, and so conquered himself also as he finally yeilded and went to his sepulcher, wept & did pennance, as by all authors is euident. This then is the first poynt of consideration in this affayre.
               The second is that this matter of miracles  is an ordinary common place, wherin the scurrility of incredulous and scoffing heretiks doth enlarge it self very much and often, it being a subiect sit for that purpose; seing that miracles being aboue the common course of natural things must needs haue some disproportion or improbability in the sense of ordinary vnderstanding, that measureth all by that they see with their eyes; and then being set forth also with mocks and moes in the most ridiculous sort that malice can deuise, and the

improbability increased commonly by such lying circumstances as are added by the reporter, it serueth to entertayne and make mery the incredulous, ignorant or light of hart, and to bring them by litle aed litle to trust or beleeue nothing that passeth sense or excedeth the reach of euery particular mannes reason.
               
                   These two obseruations then being premised in this matter, vve shal passe to examine, what our vnbeleeuing knight bringeth in to discredit miracles. And first to beginne withall, and to make some path and preamble to the infidelity which heere he meaneth to teach, he alleadgeth vs an old prouerbe (as he calleth it) which for more credit he setteth downe in different letter.VVastvvord. Pag. 58. 
                  That many are worshipped for Saints in heauen, whose soules are burning in hel. And for this in his margent he quoteth ex Auentino,
                  Ex Auentino but Auentinus his works and storie being verie great, why did he not quote the book, chapter or place: For though, Auentinus be not of much credit with Catholikes in his historie, yet might we haue examined vpon what occasion, and in what sense he said it, for that in some sense it may be somwhat true, and yet help nothing Syr F. his cause, nor the infidelity he endeauoureth by his doctryn to establish. For suppose yf that should fal out so, that some christians were deceaued about the particular holines of some persons, who being honored vpon earth for Saints, were none in deed, but rather damned, as it is reported by some that S. Ambrose by reuelation

discouered that two bodyes which had byn honored by some simple people for martyrs, not to haue byn those martyrs, but rather the bodyes of two malefactors, which suppose it were true, what hurted that the Churche of God or what hindred that the merit and deuotion of those simple people, that being deceaued honored those memories as of special seruants, and saincts of Christ, and receaued (no doubt) the reward of their deuotiō according to their meaning, and holy intention, & not according to the external error happened in the material obiect,Material error in honoring saintes hu

                     h not the deuout. as yf when Christs body was rysen from the sepulcher, the Iewes had put one of the two theeues bodies there, that were crucified with him, and S. Mary Magdalyn, and the rest had annoynted that body thinking it to be Christs, had this think yow diuinished their merit, or made their act superstitious, as heretyks cal it?
               So as thē this material error litle importeth  and consequently the place out of Auentinus (yf it be there) is nothing to the purpose. For auoyding notwithstanding of the which and lyke errors, great care was had in the primitiue Churche that the acts of Martyrs deathes, and burials should be diligently obserued, and distinctly cōmitted to wryting, for which cause not only the Bishops themselues were imployed therin, euery one in his owne diocesse, but a deacon also vnder euery Bishop,The diligēce of the primitiue Churche about Martyrs and S. and a subdeacon vnder euery deacon, and a publyke Notarie vnder euery subdeacon were assigned

to attend to this particular care. And in Rome (for that it was so big, and deuided into 7. regions) seauen deacons, and seauen subdeacons with seueral notaries vnder them had this charge, as appeareth in the Romane register ascribed to Damasus in the lyfe of Clement,
                  Damas. Pontifical. in vit. Clement. Fab. &c. 
                  Fabian, Anteros, Iulius, and other Bishops of Rome. And the-same to haue byn obserued also in the Churche of Millan testifieth Paulinus the Notarie of S. Ambrose Bishop of that cittie, who wryting the lyfe of thesayd sainct, sayth: he was vnder the charge of Castus deacon to gather such things togeather of saincts,
                  Paul. in vita Ambros. 
                  &c.
               
               
                   And before this agayne Pontius the deacon of S. Cyprian afirmeth that blessed Bishop and Martyr to haue byn so sollicitious in gathering the gests of Martyrs,Pont. Diac in vita Cypriani. as he would haue the very dayes exactly noted, in which each one suffred, which S. Cyprian testifieth also himself in his Epistle to the Priests & Deacons of his Churche of Carthage:Ep. Cyprian. ad presb. & Diacon. and of other Bishops before him,Pont ibid. thesayd Potius sayth, that they were so studious in this care, as not only of all Baptised Christians, but also of Catecumeni, if they were martyred, order was giuen to haue their acts written, &c. And this we read also put in practise by many other Churches of the world, as by that of Vienna in Austria by Lions in France by Alexādria in Egypt, and the lyke, as appeareth by their Epistles registred by Eusebius and other wryters.
               
                   This was the spirit of the ancient primitiue Churche, and the very same diligence by lyke

spirit hath byn continued by the Catholyke Churche euer since,The processe needful to Canonizatiō of saincts. not only in the acts and gests of martyrs, but of other holy men also, since martyrdome in great part hath ceased, as may appeare by the long processe, and most diligent examination of hundrethes of witnesses by lawful and indifferent iudges appoynted, when any man is to be Canonized or declared for holy in the Churche after his death, which thing for more certayntie and lesse partialitie is done by order, and authoritie of the highest iudge, and Pastor in spiritual causes, and it is not done but vpon many yeares examination commonly, except the cause be otherwayes made euident to all.
               This is the practise of the Cath. Churche, &  heere now let Sr. F. or any other wrangler or calumniator equal to himself, tel me, if any meane of trying mēnes merits & holines be to be had in this lyfe, what better, or more indifferent way can be taken then this, which is by the highest and most vniuersal Magistrate that we haue in our Churche,Fox-made-saincts not to be compared to Pope-made-saincts wheras amōg them euery particular man (as Ihon Fox for exāple) maketh saincts, and vnmaketh them at his pleasure, and putting them downe in his Calender in great red letters for martyrs, or confessors or in black lesser letters for lesser saincts as he thinketh best without any other examination, or approbration of superior authority, and that which is most ridiculous of all he careth not of what fayth or religiō they were of among themselues so they were contrarie

                   Robert Barnes an Augustine Fryar, Thomas Gerrat, and William Ierome Apostata Priests were burned together in one fyre, in Smithfeild the 30. of Iuly in the yeare 1540. as Ihon Stow, D. Sanders, and others do put it downe, though Fox in his Calender doth agree with neither of them in yeare moneth nor day, but putteth them in his Calender about the midst of Octobre 1539.Barnes, Herome & Gerat. These three were ful contrary one to another in matter of Religion especially about the most important artycles of the real presence, Barnes being an earnest Lutheran, and zealous defender of the real presence, as both Fox, act. & Mon. p. 1097.

God I take to record I neuer to my knowledge taught any erronious doctrine, but only those things which scripture led me vnto, and that in my sermons I neuer maynteyned any error &c.
                  Barnes his protestation at the fyer. Thus wryteth Fox of him and alloweth wel therof: so that if this man did erre (as in the articles of the real presence Fox wil not deny) then did the scripture lead him thervnto, & yet wil not he or Syr F. graunt that he or any man els can take hurt by reading of scriptures.
               Wel but what did the other two his opposite  mates? did they protest nothing? yes I trow,Fox, ibid. pag. 1094. col 2. for thus wryteth Fox: The lyke confession made Hierome, and Gerrat professing their belief as the tyme would suffer, wherby the people might vnderstand, that there was no cause, nor error in their fayth, wherfore iustly they ought to be condemned protesting that they denied nothing that was eyther in the old or new Testament set foorth by their soueraygne Lord the King whom they prayed the Lord long to continue, &c. Lo heere a contrary protestation for their contrary

belief founded also in scriptures especially in the K. Byble. And how can Ihon Fox now ioyne these togeather, calling them those three good Saincts of God, and making them all three martyrs, but as Sampson ioyned his foxes tailes.
               
                   And because in this last protestation there is mention of their praying for the king yow must vnderstand that they being in hope (as it seemed) of some pardon euen at the fire, flattered the king extremely, and one of them hauing exhorted the people greatly to obey and follow the king in all things, at length wryteth thus: yea I say further that yf the king should command yow any thing against Gods law,
                  Barnes ibid. apud Fox, pag. 1094. col. 2. 
                  yf it be in your power to resist him yow may not do it. Lo what a spirit of a good saint this is, that teacheth kings to haue power aboue God, but when he saw that the pardon came not, he sent certayne messages to the king by the sheriff there present wherof the first was, that he and his new fellowes the new-gospellers had made his Maiestie a whole king, wheras he was but halfe a king before (being not head of the churche nor of the cleargy of his realme) a thing (saith he) that neuer any of his Maiesties ancestors had before.
               
               
                   Behold what a benefit this was, the like wherof was bestowed by them vpon monks and friars as appeareth by a lamentable letter of Friar Peter Martyr wrytten from Oxford to Syr Iohn Cheke.

And thus much of these.
               There followeth Iohn Husse, of whome I  sayd, that he held more opinions against the protestants,Iohn Husse. then with them, which is euident by the articles of his doctrine, yet extant, and authors that haue wrytten of him, wherof we haue spoken sufficiently before in this Cap. 3.encounter; and yet is he put in Iohn Fox his calender for a solemne martyr in red letters vpō the second day of May.
               And the like I might also shew of the VValdenses, Albigenses, Pauperes de Lugduno, and many other base and desperate heretiks which Iohn Fox in his protestation to the whole churche of England doth allow for saints of his faith,Fox protest. pag. 10. wheras notwithstanding they held many more things against him then with him, and some so beastly, that they are not to be named.
               As for Iohn VVickcliff there needeth no dispute  or other proof then Iohn Fox himself and his owne testimony:Iohn VVickliffe. Fox. pag. 411.412.413. &c.

                     49. which for a tyme he had held (which Iohn Fox also confesseth) and falling agayne afterward into relapse was condemned and burned, but before his burning he recanted againe, and confirmed the same at the fire, was confessed; heard masse deuoutly, desyred absolution vpon his knees from the excommunication layd vpon him, and finally receyued the B. sacrament, as a true Catholike and so died. About which later recantation albeit Iohn Fox would seme to wrangle somwhat, yet saith he:Fox pag. 920 col. 2. 
                  admit he did so, being a man of a timerous conscience not fully resolued touching that matter of the Churche, &c. And then againe. It is not impossible but that Bilney might both heare masse and receyue the sacrament, for in that matter it may be he was not resolued otherwise, &c. Neyther do I fynd in all the articles against him, that he was charged with any opinion against the masse or sacrament, which makes me think that he was yet therin ignorant, &c. Thus answereth Fox about Thom. Bilney, granting him as yow se not to haue byn fully and in all points of his religion, yet he setteth him downe in his calender for a special martyr of his Churche in great red letters vpon the tēth day of March, saying Thomas Bilney martyr.

               Thus do relate the registers, but what  saith Iohn Fox?Fox, p 1033. col. 1 n 79. 
                  Coubridge (saith he) being mad and besides his right senses was condemned by Longland C. of Lincolne, and comitted to the fire by him to be burnt at Oxford, &c. So saith Fox, but he concealeth one thing which is: that Coubridge his cause was sent by the bishop to the L. Cromwel Vicegerent to the king at this tyme in spiritual affayres, and that by his voice also he was condemned; as Alanus Copus in the foresaid place doth shew. But how soeuer this was, yf it be true that VVilliam Coubridge was mad and besides his senses (as Fox here for his excuse

deuiseth) how happeneth it then that himself maketh him a martyr of his Churche & doth register him vnder that name and worthy title in his ecclesiastical calender vpon the 10. of October an. 1539. Is not this to make mad and furious men pillers of his new Churche?
               
                   The last was one Collyns, of whome Fox wryteth thus:Colyns and his dog. Fox. Ibid. 1033. 
                  Colyns being besides his wits & seing the priest holding vp the host ouer his head at masse, & shewing it to the people he in like manner counterfetting the priest took vp a litle dog by the legs, & held him ouer his head shewing him also to the people, for which he was brought to examination & condemned to the fyre, &c. This is the narratiō of Fox himself touching Colyns, whome notwithstanding this, he setteth downe for a solemne martyr vpō the foresaid 10. of October in the yeare of our Lord 1538. So as heer no man can deny, nor Fox himself doth, but that he maketh diuers wicked blasphemous and distracted men to be of his martyrs & patrōs in heauen; so with mad men I leaue him among whome we may wel account him, whether we consider his wit or wrytings.
               
                   Wel then to returne to our purpose treated I would aske our aduersaryes which of these two wayes hath more indifferency or reason in it, to haue saints declared by publike inquisition, examination and sentence, or by euery particular mannes iudgment and fancy at his pleasure.
               
                   And thus much is spoken of this matter by occasiō of Syr F. his Pope-made saints (which

must needs haue more authority then Fox-made-saints) and as for his prophane proposition (which he calleth a prouerb) to wit, that many be worshipped in heauen for saincts that are damned in hel:Pag. 59. he would draw all mennes harts into mistrust and contempt of all saints, their miracles and memories, I thought good to enlarge my self somwhat in this behalf, to shew the conformity of spirit betwene auncient christians & vs, for the care towards saincts, and our equal proceeding conforme to all reason and piety in declaring the holynes of saincts, & the contrary mad fantastical dealing of heretiks doing or vndoing of their owne heads what each mā for the tyme thinketh best. For imagine yow yf the Lutherans in Germany should haue the vewing or correcting of Iohn Fox his martyrologe, how many saints would they strike out and cast to the dunghil which he hath put in, and painted out in the highest degree? And the like would Brownists and Puritans doe. Nothing then is certayne among these goodfellowes, and so let vs leaue them, for this is the diuels drift by discrediting some to cal all in question.
               But now to return to the Archbishop S. Thomas, whome in particular our knight desyreth to discredit, let vs heare what he sayth. First he cyteth out of Caesarius a monk, as he calleth him;Pag. 59. 
                  That there was a question made in Paris after S. Thom. his death whether he were damned or saued, Roger the Norman (who had byn a special

enimy to the Archbishop) saying that he was dāned, for that heresisted his King, & Peter a Parisian, that was chaunter of that Churche holding that he was a true martyr. This story out of Caesarius is in part true, but yet powdered with so many falsities & corruptions, partly by Sr. F. and partly by Iohn Fox (from whome he took it) as it is a world to see, and sheweth euidently that a mā may beleeue nothing they alleadge, further then he seeth it with his eyes.
               
                   For first they alleadge this author quite against his owne meaning,A notorious corruption of Caesarius by Fox and Syr F. for he being a German and lyuing about Colonia at the same tyme or soone after the Archb. was murdered, he proueth his great holines among other things by his great and many miracles, for that is the title of his book, Illustrum miraculorum & historiarum memorabilium libri, 12. Twelue books of famous miracles and histories happened in the world. And hauing spoken of other countryes and men, at length he commeth to treat of S. Tho. of Canterbury in these words: Beatus Thomas, &c. Blessed, Thomas Bishop of Canterbury who in our tyme hath fought for the liberty o

                  and after his slaughter there hath byn much disputing, seme saying that he was damned as a traytor of the Kingdome, and others that he was a martyr as defendor of the Churche. And the same questiō was disputed also in Paris among the masters, for M. Roger swore that he was worthie of death albeit not such a death as he had, iudging the blessed mānes constancy to be a contumacy.

On the other side M. Peter chantor affirmed vpon his oath that he wus a worthie martyr of God, and slayne sor the liberty of his Churche. These mens questions (or controuersies) Christ hath now dissolued, hauing glorified him with many and great myracles.
               
               These are the true words of Caesarius translated  out of Latyn, and if we wil see the falshood both of Fox & his scholler Sr. F. in alleaging this one litle text only, it shal not be amisse to set it downe heere as it is found in Fox himself, first in Latyn and then in English. Thus thē Fox alleadgeth Caesarius his words: Quaestio Paris

                  Thus do Fox and Sr. F. alleadge his latyn woords which in English are these:Fox doth Falsly all
                           •
                        adg Cesarius. There was a question mooued among the maisters or doctors of Paris, whether that Thomas were saued or damned: Roger then a norman, sayd that he was worthie death & damnation for that he was so obstinate against Gods minister the King, Peter Cantor a Parisian came out to the contrary, saying that his miracles were great signes and tokens of his saluation, and also of great holynes, affirming moreouer, that the cause of the Churche did allow and confirme his martyrdome, for the which he died. Thus farre Fox.

                     nsure of the schoole of Paris touching this question for the taynting of Thom. Becket. And yet as you see it was but the altercation of two men, the one a Norman (as Fox saith) subiect at that tyme to the king of England, & the other a Parisian subiect to the king of France, who in reason may seeme more indifferent for that he was not interessed on any side. Yet with what face can Fox out of these words affirme, that here was giuen the iudgment and censure of all the Vniuersity of Paris, seing it was but an altercation of two priuate men only. Who discouereth not heer the impudent false humor of Fox in calling it the determination of the Vniuersity of Paris?
               
               
                   But let vs now returne to examine the notorious abusing of this short authority by Fox and his scholler Syr F. First they cut of (as yow see by the text it self before set downe in English verbatim) the whole beginning and ending of the authors speech,Many corruptions of Caesarius both in latyn &c English. which do comprehend the ful purpose and meaning of his narration, with his whole iudgment of the controuersy, which is such dishonest dealing as may be in abusing any author. And after this Fox choosing to put downe the text for more credits sake in the latyn tongue, first he should haue put his very owne words as yow know, which he hath not done, but hath added, altered, and taken away so much as he thought good for his purpose, making his

reader notwithstanding beleeue, that they were the very woords of the author, seing he putteth downe first the latyn and then the English in a different letter. But yet he that shal examine, and compare text with text, he shal fynd added first the whole sentence, virum damnatus an saluatus esset ille Thomas, Then dixerat Rogerius tunc Normannus; thirdly, quod contumax esset in Dei ministrum, reg
                        •
                     m. Fourthly is added the word (damnatione) which is not in Caesarius. Fifthly, quod signa saluationis & magnae sanctitatis essent eius miracula, is not in the authors text, sixtly also the words, quod martyrium probasset Ecclesiae causa. Caesarius hath them not.
               All these words and sentences therfore are  foisted in by Iohn Fox euen in latin which make the more part or very neare, of the whole text by him cited. He cutteth of (besides the beginning and ending before mentioned) these words following: first of Roger, who though he affirmed him to be worthy of death, yet he addeth etsi non tali yet not of such a death as he had, which words Iohn Fox cōcealeth, as he doth also the words immediatly following of Caesarius: beati viri constā
                     tiam, iudicans contumaciam; iudging the holy mannes constācy to be contumacy. After this Fox leaueth out those words pro libertate Ecclesiae tru
                        •
                     idatum, that he was slaine for the libertie of his Churche, but especially those that immediatly follow contayning the authors conclusion of all, which are these: quorum quaestionem Christus soluit, cùm multis & magnis miraculis

illum glorificauit, whose question (or controuersy) Christ hath dissolued, in that he hath glorifyed him with many and great miracles.
               
                   Thus wrote Caesarius, soone after S. Thom. his martyrdome. And now by this one example of playne forgery and cosenage, and by these few lynes so corrupted peruerted and altered, the reader may imagine, what infinite falshood is to be found in Fox his huge volume according to this accōpt. In which vpon my conscience (and some trial also) I do think there is scarse any one story truly related in all parts in that monstrous huge book. And yet yow must mark also that Syr F. doth not cyte so much as Iohn Fox for this allegation out of Caesarius neyther any author besides,False dealing in both hāds betvvene the Maister and scholler. least the falshood should be found. And so much for this poynt.
               
                   Yow haue hard what falsifications & forgeryes haue byn vsed,Diuers vvayes deuise
                        •
                      by haeretiks to disc edit miracles. to make authors to speak some euil against this blessed Saint. Now when that cannot stand, but that God testified his holines with so many and famous miracles, as Caesarius liuing in that tyme, and so many others before, eye witnesses, do testifie; consider whether the impiety of restlesse heretykes doth rush. They deuise diuers wayes how to delude or discredit all miracles, and thereby also these of S. Thomas. And first Iohn Fox deuiseth two, saying, that yow may answere,
                  For pag. 204. col. 2. nu. 70. 
                  that eyther they were not wrought at all, but deuised and forged by fryars and monks: or yf they were

wrought in deed, it was not by the power of God, but of the 
                        •
                     iuel and his deceauing spirit. Which later way he taketh from the Iewes, who as yow wel remember not being able to deny the miracles wrought by Christ, obiected vnto him that he did them by the power of Satan and cast out diuels by the hands not of God but of Belsebub.
                  Math 24. Marc. 22. And to these two wayes of euasion Syr F. as a good scholler hath added a third, which is: that many of these miracles might be done by natural power and meanes, though hidden to the ignorant.
               
               And now tel me (gentle Reader) what miracles  of Christ and his Apostles may not be brought in question and made doubtful by some of these 3. means. And consider I beseech thee) whether the spirit of heretyks doth lead a sensual mannes vnderstanding; Is it not to doubt of all? For what more certainty haue I, or can any man haue of the auncient miracles of the primatiue Churche, then that diuers vertuous and learned authors do wryte them, who lyued in the same tymes when the things were done? and when they would haue byn contradicted (no doubt) by all the world, yf they had byn false or forged, as none euer of S. Tho. were called in question by any author of ancient tyme, so farre as we vnderstand.
               Againe I would haue thee consider (good  reader) attentiuely with thy self,VVhich is the better spirit to beleeue or discredit miracles. which is the better spirit, more pious and more secure, eyther to scoff at miracles, and extraordinary work
                     •
                   done by God, and to seek reasons to discredit them, as Protestants do, or to enclyne

rather to beleeue them, or at least wayes quietly to let them passe with pious humility, thinking that God can do these and greater matters to his glory, and hath done for and by his seruants. And consequently whether they be true or false the matter not being apparent to praise God for that which is reported of his workes, rather then to scoff therat, which is the true spirit of Catholike men, who do not make euery one of these miracles matter of their beleef, nor yet on the contrary side do runne to the proud or contentious spirit of condemning all, or calling euery thing in controuersy with contempt, wheras in temporal matters also they beleeue many things vpon lesse authority and witnesses.
               
                   And surely yf we cōsider the whole course of scripture we shal fynd pious credulity to be much more secure and comended,Credulity commended in scriptures. then diffidence, distrust, or incredulity, and that also about miracles.Mar. 16. Ioan. 12. For why was S. Mary Magdalen so much commended before others but for that she was more prone then the rest to beleeue the miracle of Christs resurrectiō, when it was told her? And why was S. Thomas so much reprehended by Chryst, when he said, noli esse incredulus,
                  Ioan. 20. 
                  sed fidelis. Be not thou incredulous but faithful, but for that he would not beleeue the miracle of Christs apparition, and entrance when the dores were shut, related vnto him by others? And why was S. Peter reprehended by Christ when he said,Math. 14.

               Now whether Protestāts or Catholiks be  giuen more to this quality of incredulity in matters of miracles, all the world seeth. It is reported that some yeares since, a certayne learned man comming among a crue of Protestants that did scoffe merily at miracles,A Story of lesting at miracles. he told them pleasantly, that he had fallen of late vpon a certayne book of ancient monkes in the primatiue Churche, wherin were many strange miracles wrought, which he said he was in great doubt whether he might beleeue or no, and desyred to haue there opinion; and they prayed him to recount some of them,Strange

                     racles. and so he did, saying: That the first was of a certayne poor man, cutting downe  wood, the head or iron of whose hatcher, falling into a great deep water, he cryed to a

                  m againe.
               
                   At this story all began to laugh hartily.  And then he told another, that a certayne man being dead and buryed, by chaunce in a place, where a certaine holy monke or friar had byn buried before, as soone as the dead body touched the monks bones, he turned to lyfe againe.
               
                   Then he told them further, that a certayne poor woman, which was wont to giue milk to monks, one day had but a litle panne ful of milk left, and the monks would needs eat it, but she said that she had no more for herselfe. Then they told her, she should haue the more for their eating of that, and so they did eat it, & after the womman found more milk in her daitry, then euer before. This being heard increased the pastime.
               
                   After this he told yet more incredible tales,  as that one monkes mule talked to him vpon  the way. And that diuers monks coming to a great ryuer when they could not passe, one of them made a bridge with his cloak or cool.  And that one of them falling into the water, was deuoured by a fish but shortly after gotten  out againe of the fishes belly. And that one of these monks hearing that one of his frends was sick, took of his girdle and sent it to him, which touching the sick, presently he  was wel. And that other sick people of incurable

               When all these things were told, much iesting their was, and some said they were prety tales, and some other of a more hoat and zealous protestant spirit entred into indignation, saying that this was abhominable superstition, and folly to beleeue these tales, or suffer them in wryting. Wherat the man that had told them was forced for his owne defence, to shew that all he had recounted was wrytten in the holy scripture, changing a litle the names of persons,Explication of the former miracles. which he had done to the end they should not presently discouer him. And so he declared that the first of his examples was taken out of the  book of Kings, where is recounted of the head of an hatchet made swymne by the prophet Elizeus the 4. book of kings 6. Chapter.
               The second of the dead man raysed by touching  
                  Elizeus his bones, is in the same book &  13. Chapter. The third of increasing the  milk is expressed in the same book and chapter, by increasing the oyle of the poor woman of Sarepta. The fourth, of the talk  which the monke hath with his mule, is veryfied in the speech of Balaam his asse, in the book of Numbers 22. chapter. The fifth of  passing of many monks through a great riuer, by help of a monks cloak, is shewed in Elias his fact, in the 4. book of Kings 2. chapter.

                   And so we see that by iesting at monks miracles as also of bishops, and other godly men, that are recorded to haue wrought such wō
                  derful works in Christs Churche by the same power and vertue of their master as the former saints did, these scorners come to deryde also and cal in doubt the miracles of all ages as wel of the primatiue Churche, as of later tymes, for that there is no other reason of beleeuing them of those dayes, but only the testimony of the Churche in that tyme and of graue wryters therin. The like wherof we haue for witnesses of those of Sr. Thomas, which our heretical English spirits of these dayes do so malitiously deryde contemne and iest at. But with mad men there is no disputing, and so to their phrensy of heresy I leaue them.

For in that he saith, we obey the meanest priest as the highest, yf he come with authority of the highest, he sheweth therby that we haue among vs true obediēce and subordination, and that for conscience sake, not respecting so much the person that commaundeth, as him for whome, & in whose name, and authority he comandeth; and therin we fulfil the precept of S.

                   His preface consisteth in qualifying the wrytings of D. Harding and M. Iewel calling the former an inuectiue, and the later of blessed memory, wheras all learned men that haue read the same with indifferency (and diuers great protestants also conuerted by that reading) wil and do testifie the contrary, to wit that D. Hardings wryting against Iewel (especially his last book called,D. Hardinges vvorkes against Iuel. 
                  The returne of vntruthes) was rather a cōuictiue then an inuectiue, leauing M. Iewel with the commendation rather of a lying, then blessed memory. And so I dare auouch that any mā shal find him, who hath tyme learning, store of books, patience & indifferency to read and examin him.
               Now then let vs examin the foure points  before mentioned wherof the first is his ordinary  slieght, wherby he alleageth D. Hardings assertion about S. Peter & S.

                   S. Peter & S. Paul being now absent, cannot personally determine all matters as when they were here in earth, but haue left their successors in their place to be obeyed as themselues. Why should this propositiō so much mislike our Kt? Sure I am that he dareth not deny the same or equiualēt therof in the magistrats of diuers citties, Princes & tēporal successors. And yf a man for examples sake, should aske him whether God do commaund English men at this day to obey the Queene that now raigneth in matters belonging to her gouernment, or rather VVilliam Conquerour first founder of this Monarchie, or K. Henry the 8. her Maties. Father? and so in other Princes; as whether the present K. of France be to be obeyed and respected or Hugo Capetus the first founder of his house? No man wil doubt but that present Princes and gouernors are to be obeyed.
               
                   And yf in temporal successors this be to be obserued, why not also in spiritual? Is the Kt. so simple as he seeth not, the cōuenience of this matter? and that gouernours present, and not past are to be repayred vnto for present resolution and decision of affayres?

                   yet is most absurd in all mennes sights: for that all causes incident are not determined in S. Peter and S. Paul their epistles, nor can all men read and vnderstand them, and consequently is needful the authority of a present gouernour s

               Thirdly then consider the heretical cauillation  of Sr. Frācis his inference vpon the forsaid  premises which is this: Ergo he biddeth vs to obey the Pope though he teach contrary to S. Peter and S. Paul. This Doctor Harding sayth not, nor is it necessary, nor doth it follow of the premisses, but only is a wrangling of a contentious heretical spirit, as euery man may see, and ought diligently to marke for their instruction how to beleeue, and giue credit to those mens arguments and illations: Wherfore after all these note the fourth point which is his substantial conclusion: And this (I hope) (sayth he) is a sufficient  iustification for my accusation. His accusation was as before hath byn heard, that the Pope is to be obeyed, though he command blasphemies against

               But yet to the end he may seeme to say somthing to proue that Popes comaund somtymes both blasphemies and disloyalty, he alleadgeth for the first (about blasphemy) certayne peeces of prayers out of Portiphorium vsed vpon the festiual day of S.

                     Make vs (o Christ) to climbe whither Tho. did ascend.

Out of which words, where there is not a spirit of wrangling & calumniation no euil sense can be gathered: For in the former, there is no more blasphemy conteyned, then when the holy prophets did mention the name, faith and merits of Abraham Isaac and Iacob,
                  Psalm. 131. Daniel. 13. and other their holy fathers, therby the sooner to mooue God to respect them.

Thomas of Canterbury, the knights choller and pryde mounteth vp to the assault, of a farre higher Saint, which is the mother of God her self, whose sacred conception he taketh heynously, that it should be honoured with a seueral feast and holy day by Pope Sixtus Quartus: for thus he wryteth.

               Thus wryteth our knight wherin if yow fynd him more true & sincere then in his former narrations and assertions it is maruayle, for though somethings be true which heer he relateth, as namely first that Sixtus the fourth took vp the controuersy betweene the Religious of S. Francis and S. Dominiks order about the conception of the blessed virgin, (which is the benefit of hauing one supreme head, a thing not to be found among sectaries) and secondly that he allowed the solemnizing, of a feast vpon that day, and gaue indulgences also, to such as with deuotion and contrition for their sinnes should celebrate or hear diuine seruice, and this to the encrease of Christian piety, yet are there twice as many other points heer set downe by our knight quite false and forged of himself.
               
                   For first it is false, that Pope Sixtus, decreed the conception of the blessed virgin to haue byn without original sinne:First vntruth for albeit himself being of S. Francis order before he was Pope, did hold that opinion for more probable that she was conceyued pure from original sinne, yet did he neuer decree the same, but left it

                   In which words we see two points most euident for conuincing the former two falshoods of the knight: the one that the Pope himself affirmeth heer, that the matter was not yet decyded by him or the Sea Apostolyk: the secōd, that he was so farre of from excommunicating or condemning for heretyks those that held the contrary opinion to his (as Sr. Francis saith heere he did) that he excommunicateth all those, that should hold them for heretyks, or that they sinned deadly for being of that opinion.
               
                   And this for the first two vntruthes auouched so audaciously by our Kt. other two there are which I wil not stād vpon,The 3. and 4. vntruthes. but remit him to the authors that wryte therof.

               And this may be sufficient for this matter, for that the grounds & principles of his babling being meerly false and forged, as I now haue shewed, to wit that eyther Pope Sixtus defined the question affirmatiuely for our B. Ladies conception out of original sinne or that he excommunicated all that held the contrary opiniō; it must needs follow, that all the inconueniences and obiected blasphemies buylded by him therin as castles in the ayre, must fal and he vnder them: and so we leaue him for the present, and wil passe ouer to his minister, and se what he bringeth, or hath to say also in this affayre.

                   WE hauing hitherto seene and beheld how wel our knight hath discharged himself about the former position of obedience to Popes and their commandements, we must needs now giue a litle roome also to his champian or Proctor O.E. who vndertaketh his defence, though somewhat more coldly, and much more impertinently then the knight himself fighteth for himself. You shal see by the issue of the combat, how truly this is spoken.
               
                   First this minister hauing cited the words. of Syr Francis thus:Pag. 53. 
                  That albeit the Pope and his cleargie comaund blasphemies, &c. yet must he be obeyed vpon paine of damnation; he addeth presently: and his meaning is most true: not so much defending the words as the meaning of the wryter, as though he had had conference with the knight about it. For iustifying of which meaning, he bringeth in this substātial proof:

                   it follow therby that either the Pope wil command them blasphemies or yf he would or could, that they must needes obey him therin, seing their obedience to him is in respect of Christ and for Christ and blasphemies are against Christ, and this folly is no lesse ridiculous then if one should say (for examples sake) to the Neapolitās at this day, yow professe obedience vnto your Viceroy, as to the king of Spayne himself, ergo if he should command yow treasons against the king yow would obey him; were not this a wise argument trow yow, but now the second is as wise as this. Boniface the eight (saith he) maketh subiection to the Pope to be a matter of Saluation. Suppose he do, seing that to obey or disobey our Superiors is a matter of saluation or dānatiō by S. Paules expresse words.Rom. 13. But what is this to blasphemies? But heare his thyrd argument: Bellarmine (saith he) maketh it an essential point of a Catholike, to be vnder the Pope. This also we graunt. But what inference can be made of this? It followeth further: And such trust haue Papists in his iudgment, concerning matters of faith, that they think he cannot be deceaued.

This is exaggerated, for we cal it not sacrilege, but pryde rather, disobedience, malepartnesse, and other lyke sinnes for inferiors lightly to dispute or examine the doyngs of their Superiors; which among Protestants perhaps is held for a commendation and quicknesse of wit; for so this minister determineth the matter presently after,Ibid. saying: VVe are not to beleeue euery thing our Pastors teach, but as farre as they teach the doctrine of Christ Iesus, nor are we absolutely to obey, but when they commaund according to the law.

               Behold heer the Pope nothing at all flattered  by S. Boniface in this Canon,Playne speech of S. Boniface to all Popes. which Protestants do cite for most high flattery towards him. And if all Canonists or Popes themselues did loue flattery so much as this minister, and his mates do make them, they would neuer haue suffered this playne speech to haue byn registred for a Canon of Ecclesiastical decrees, to be seene and read by all the world to all posterity. As neyther would they permit the bookes of S. Bernard, de Consideratione ad Eugenium Papam, wherin he putteth both that and all other Popes in due considerations of their owne defects which are willingly read by Protestants. But yet togeather with this playnesse; doth this holy martyr S. Boniface, as also the other deuout Father S. Bernard, acknowledge the Popes prerogatiue also of not being subiect to any mortal mānes iudgmēt in this world, except in matter of apostasie from

                  nd this is all that heer is said of this matter, which doctrine about the Popes immunity from iudgment in this lyfe, cannot in reason mislike Protestants, seing many of them and other their frēdes in their books do grant thesame priuiledge to euery temporal prince in his owne dominion making him so absolute both in temporal and spiritual affayres,See tvvo books of Bellay named Apologies in

               But what doth our knight prooue any one  authentical poynt in this part also of practise (though I do not deny but that some abuses may haue byn committed by particular persons,About abuses of Indulgences. in the vse of indulgences also as there want not euil liners among Christians) doth he bring forth (I say) any one example of any one publyke practise to the cōtrary? No truly, but only sayth in general,Pag. 70.

                   These verses alleadgeth Sr. Frācis to make sporte at indulgences; but if yow take away the simplicity of the latyn and poēsy incident to that age, they contayne no absurdity at all, but do set forth the force and vertue of almes in the very words almost that are found in

scripture. For in the

                   are these things brought in by way of scoffe against pardons and indulgences, which nothing appertayne vnto them? and are sentences taken out of the scripture it self.
               He addeth to this purpose a complaint of  the Princes of Germany (as he calleth them) exhibited against the Popes pardons at a counsel in Norenberg,
                  Pag. 71. Malitious concealing of circumstances to deceaue the reader. but he telleth not in what yeare this was, nor what maner of counsel, nor that these Princes were new protestants, nor that Luther did endite this complaint, for if he had told any one of these circumstances it would haue infringed the credit of his tale,Ibid. Pag. 72▪
                   as that which he telleth of one Tecelius the Popes pardon marchaunt as he termeth him of whome he wryteth a iest how he was deceyued and cosened in selling of pardons, but for that he citeth neyther author book time nor place, I giue it the credit as such pulpit tales of Sir Francis ministers do require.
               That old obiection also of Card. Como his  letter to Parry wherin he is affirmed to say:

                  
                     〈…〉
                   
                  pardon of all your sinnes as 
                  
                     〈…〉
                   answered. For first it is 
                     〈…〉
                   in his letter to Pope 
                     〈…〉
                   from Paris when he 
                     〈…〉
                   1583. discouered no

                   any particular enterprice 
                     〈…〉
                   only in general, that he 
                     〈…〉
                   great matters for the 
                     〈…〉
                   Cath. religion, for recompence of the 
                     •
                  urts which he had done diuers yeares before by spiery for the state of England. And this appeareth as wel by the letter yet extant as for that he vttering his whole plot to her Ma•ie and her counsel at his first comming in was notwithstanding fauorably handled for a great space, vntil falling into discontentment through want, he practised with him that discouered his teachery: Secondly the Popes graunt of Indulgence vnto him was meant only with due circumstāces, if he were contrite and confessed of his sinnes, which is wont to be added cōmonly in all indulgences, or is necessary to be vnderstood. For which cause, this obiection is to no purpose at all.
               
                   Wherfore I would leaue of in this place to speak any more of this argument of indulgences as vnable to be disprooued eyther in doctrine or practise, by Sir Francis, but that I must discouer one trik of his more about alleadging Durandus,
                  pag. 70. before I end my speech. As for the authority (saith he) wher-vpon your indulgences are grounded, your owne men confesse as namely (among the rest) Durandus: De indulgentijs pauca dici

possunt per certitudinem qui 
                        〈…〉
                      ijs loquitur; sancti etiam 
                        〈…〉
                      Hieronymus, Augustinus, mit 
                        〈…〉
                      gentijs, &c. Litle can be 
                     〈…〉
                   indulgences because 
                     〈…〉
                   speaketh expressely of the 
                     〈…〉
                   Fathers Ambrose, Hilary, 
                     〈…〉
                   make no mention of them. 
                     〈…〉
                   
                  confesse, that yow haue neyther warrant 
                        〈…〉
                      nor of the auncient fathers for your popish 
                        〈…〉
                      go they currant, &c.
               
               Howsoeuer they go currant (Syr knight) among vs, yet go not yow currāt, but do hault downe to the ground, and that in three things about this one text. First in the citation, then in the deductiō or illation of the sense: thirdly in the words themselues alleaged. And let the reader consider, whether falshood may be found in more points then these in the handling or alleadging of any author.
               For the first, though he name Durandus, yet  quoteth he no place,The first shift. where yow may find it, which for the most part (as before we haue noted) implyeth lightly some deceyt or subtile trick in the allegation, which he would not haue discouered, as now by experience we haue learned, and the third point shal declare.
               For the second about the illation he maketh out of the words of Durand,The second shift. if they were all in all respects truly alleaged, it is false and cauillous. For if any Arrian or Anabaptist in the dayes of S. Ambrose Hilary, and Ierome, whome

                  
                     〈…〉
                   haue made lyke 
                     〈…〉
                  , and sayd (as they 
                     〈…〉
                   of Homousion, 
                        〈…〉
                     , as also the baptisme 
                     〈…〉
                   to be found in 
                     〈…〉
                   such and such auncient 
                     〈…〉
                   
                  Iustinus and others of that 
                     〈…〉
                   thing of it; ergo yow hold 
                     〈…〉
                   neyther haue warrant in 
                     〈…〉
                   of auncient Fathers.
               
                  This argument (I say) or illation against these doctrynes had byn as good as this of Syr Francis against pardons, and yet had it byn naught and deceytful and the reason is, for that albeyt those doctrines for the blessed Trinity and baptisme of children, were not expressely conteyned in scripture, yet were they sufficiently deduced therof. And albeit those former fathers as Iustinus, Irenaeus and others had not occasion expressely to handle or treat of these controuersyes being occupied in other matters yet neuer taught they the contrary & other fathers following after them did teache & testifie that doctrin to be Catholike which was sufficient. And the very like may be answered by vs in this behalfe, as by the third poynt of Syr Francis paltry dealing shal appeare.
               
                   The third point then is his fraudulent alleaging of the words of Durand,
                  The 3. shift. leauing out some, which are greatly to the purpose, and do plainly insinuate the answere that now I haue giuen. For first after Durand had said

that the scripture did not 
                     〈…〉
                   indulgences, he alleaget
                     •
                   
                  
                     〈…〉
                   scripture as Tibi dabo claues 
                  
                     〈…〉
                   16. &c. Quodcunque ligaueris, 
                  
                     〈…〉
                   of which textes he saith: Non 
                        〈…〉
                      collatione indulgentiarum debeant 
                  
                     〈…〉
                   cleare than these places of 
                     〈…〉
                   vnderstood of giuing 
                     〈…〉
                   words being added to the word 
                     〈…〉
                   the former clause, do euidently signify 
                     〈◊〉
                   albeit Durand did not think that the doctrine of indulgences, was cleerly and expresly contayned in scripture, yet that it might be deduced out of scripture, for which cause Syr Frācis cut them out. This is one trick, let vs see another.
               Immediatly after the words in Durand, &  the Auncient Fathers S. Ambrose, Hilary, Hierome, August. made no mention of indulgences, &c. followeth Gregorius tamen loquitur, but S. Gregory speaketh of them. This Syr Frauncis dasheth out, which was a principal verb in this matter. For a man might answere that albeit the particular vse of indulgences were not so treated of, by S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, and other former doctors occupied in other affayres and stryfes with other heretiks, yet soone after in S. Gregory the great his tyme, which was a thousand yeares agoe, the vse and exercise therof was common in the Churche, seing Durand in this very place affirmeth not only that S. Gregory speaketh of them, but also that he is said to haue ordayned

                   by what meanes so euer, which shal appeare also, by that which ensueth in the sequent Chapter, yf first we take a short vew of that which his Minister O. E. bringeth in to assist him, which is such stuffe as is commonly vttered by such broken marchaunts. Let vs heare what he saith:
               
                  VVhat O. E. sayeth of indulgences.
               
               
                  
                  It is most true (saith he) which Sir Francis affirmeth,
                  O.E. Pag. 54. 
                  that the Papists, when they haue committed most abhominable offences, and liued in all filthynes, are notwithstanding taught, that the Pope hath power to pardon them, and absolue them, &c. Mark here two words subtily ioyned togeather of pardoning and absoluing as though they were one, wheras indeed they import farre different things, as before hath byn shewed, for that absoluing implyeth that it must be done by vertue of the sacrament of pennance and absolution, and so reacheth to all synnes neuer so greeuous, but pardoning is proper to indulgences, and stretcheth no further but to the release of temporal punishment, as before hath but declared.
               
                  And thus the minister

               All these speches and circumstances (I say) are added and much more by Iohn Fox, and S. Frācis to the Story to make it vp more ful, for that no such word is in the author (Caxtō
                  ) but rather the contrary, that both the monk and the abbot were very sorrowful.

                     dulently. to wit. The monk being absolued of his Abbot (a forehand) went, &c. where yow see that he putteth downe the word a forehand with a parenthesis as added of himself, if any would vrge him of falshood: But Sr. Francis taketh quite a way the parenthesis and affirmeth the matter absolutely, saying: He highly commended his zeale and gaue him absolution a forehand for committing of this wicked act. &c.
               
               And by this let the reader iudge of them both Maister and scholler, doctor & disciple;

and I haue byn the longer in diciphering their cosenage in this one example to the end that their malice and lack of cōscience being fully seene in few points, may be held suspected in the rest: For that most true it is, that they who in matters of religion do falsifie and lye of purpose, cannot possibly be thought to be true or religious in any thing, nor to seek religion for religion, but faction and self wil vnder the name of religiō, let them say what they wil.
               And this shal suffise for this chapter, where is nothing to be added about our minister O.E. for that he passeth ouer with vtter silence all that the knight hath handled in this place, about the poysoning of king Iohn, so as all the blame must light vpon himself, his champiō not presuming to make any defence at all for him. Now then let vs passe to that which ensueth.
            
            
               THE SPEECH OF THE warder is defended wher he calleth the way of saluation by only faith, the common Cart way of protestants, the truthe of which doctrin is examined. CAP. XVI.
               AND thus haue I followed Syr Francis  and his Wastword throughout this second Encounter, foot by foot, and step after

step, as yow haue seene, leesing much tyme in answering many impertinent poynts that might haue byn ouerslipt and contemned, but that I would omit nothing in these two first Encounters, and now with the like patience wil we harken also to his conclusion of this second Encounter vttered by the Warder thus:
               
                  
                  Now then the knight hauing set downe these foure absurd grounds of religion in our name,VVardvvord Pag. 26. faigned by himself, and acompanyed with so many other lyes and falshoods as yow haue heard, yow shal see how he maketh his conclusion and triumpheth as though he had donne somwhat of importance, these are his words:
               
               
                  A fond conclusion.
                  Thus haue yow (saith he) the blynd course they sought to breed vs in, by debarring vs the cleare light of the holy written word of God, and the carelesnesse they sought to setle in vs of all religion, by making it a thing impertinent to vs, as though we had no soules to care for, &c. Thus saith the knight in his watchword whervuto the Warder answereth in these words.
               
                  
                  This conclusion to him that hath read the former foolish positions, with their confutations, may serue for some disport and recreation, to behold how this seely knight bestirreth himselfe vpon castles buylded in the ayre, by false imaginations and sottish apprehensions of his owne, especially in a long ridiculous discourse that he maketh immediatly vpon these words in his book, where immagining

that all goeth by pardons with vs, and that pardons may be had for money he inferreth that all rich men may easily be saued in our religion, without any difficulty, & yet saith he, Christ taught vs, that it was as easy for a Camel to passe through a needles eye, as for a rich man to go to heauen, and so he maruayleth how these things can stand togeather.
               
               
                  To which I might answere, that it seemeth  as easy to teach a beare to play vpon a tabor,The knight vnderstandeth not diuinity. as to learne Syr Francis to be a good deuyne, and that I would more easily take vpon me to make a camel to goe through a nedles eye (in that sense that Christ spake it) or any rich man in the world to enter into heauen (yf he would follow my counsel) then to frame Syr Francis old head to vnderstand the depth of Catholike religion.
               
               
                  And therfore amidst his ridiculous doubts I leaue him to his Ministers to resolue him, except he wil determine to be a Catholike, repent, goe to confession, and do satisfaction, for then his ghostly father by the pennance he may chaunce to inioyne him, wil let him see and feele, that all goeth not by pardons, nor yet by money among vs; And that there is another strayter needles eye for him to enter (though he be rich) then the buying of pardons, yf he wil go to heauen after the Catholike manner, to wit by the 3. partes of pennance before touched, contrition, confession, & satissaction, vnto which course towards heauen God enclyne our knight, for otherwayes he

wil neuer come thither, seing that the open and easy cartway of his only faith is farre different from the needles eye, & narrow path, that Christ speaketh of (in the ghospel) as necessary to saluation.
               
               
                   Thus endeth the Warder his second Encounter all which the knight letteth passe in peace,The controuersy of iustification by only faith. vntil the very last words, of the open and easy Cartway of only faith, whervnto he maketh an assault as followeth:VVast. Pa. 75. 
                  As for that which yow blasphemously call (saith he) the open Cartway of only faith, yow shal find a strayter & narrower passage, then yow would beare the world in hand, if yow conceaue not an historical faith, which may be dead, but a true, liuely and iustifying faith, for though we be iustified by faith only, apprehending Christ his obedience and merits, &c. Yet are we not iustified by an only faith, such as is voyd and destitute of good workes but in the person of them that are iustified faith and good works are vnited & coopled togeather, though in the act of iustifying they are seuered, it being the proper duty of faith alone, as a hand to apprehend and take hold of Christ, &c.
               
               
                   Thus he saith, and in these words he speaketh plaine contradictories, and maketh a difference without a diuersity as yf a man man should say: albeit we hold that Iack is Iohn,
                  Faith only & only faith. yet must yow not think that Iohn is Iack. Though we be iustified (saith he) by faith only; yet are we not iustified by an only, faith. But I would aske yow (Syr) what doth sola fides signifie
                  ▪ which are the very words of your sollemne assertiō, both out of Luther & Caluyn

                     ficat, fayth alone iustifieth: doth not sola fides in the latyn tongue signify rather fayth alone, or an only faith, then faith only, which in the Latyn is expressed rather by the aduerbe fides folùm vel solummodò

                   And if this be true (as all gramers and lexicons wil teach yow that it is) then is your distinctiō (wherby yow say that we are iustified by saith only and not by an only saith) not only vayne, but absurd also and against your self,
                     
                        〈1 paragraph〉
                     
                   who hold that sola fides iustificat faith alone or an only faith iustifieth. And thus much for the contradiction in your owne words.
               But now if we go to the substance it self  of the controuersy, wherin some later Protestants also do hold that good works are absolutely necessary to saluation, according to our knights assertion in this place, yow must vnderstand the fraud of this shift which consisteth in this,The disagreeing of Lutherans & Caluenists about this controuersy. that wheras Luther the first founder of the proposition only faith iustifieth, so defendeth the same, as he not only excludeth but detesteth and abhorreth both the concurrance & presence of any good works towards a mānes saluation: some later Protestāts (especially Caluinists) being ashamed of the absurdity of the doctrine, and desyring withall to disgrace Luther, and his fellowes in this point as in many others, haue taken vpon them to mittigate the matter, and to say, that albeyt good works can help nothing indeed in the act of iustification (and consequently also neyther to saluation) yet they are necessary as

fruits, and so necessary; as that no saluation can be without them, wherin though, in words they would seeme to say somwhat, yet is it but a meere shift and euasion, and first contradicteth Luther and Lutherans plainly, whome they would make shew to expound and enterpret, and then it is euidently false also in it self as breefly I shal declare.
               
                   And first touching the cōtradiction, which this new inuention of Caluinists hath with the doctrine of their father Luther,

                  Now I come to the doctrine of the new Papists (so he calleth Syr Francis & his fellowes that wil bring in any necessity of works whatsoeuer) which is as pernicious as the old. They say that the Apostle means to exclude good workes from iustification non simpliciter sed ratione debiti, not simply but as due, but only as meritorious and causes efficient, whervpon these doctors or rather seducers, do diuers wayes elude that proposition of S. Paule, we are iustified by faith gratis without works, each one according to his owne

                  But the true sense of Paules words is, that without all merit, condition or necessity of our workes by only faith in Christ, we are iustified before Christ, and saued; so as our saluation doth in no sort depend of our

workes neyther be they any way necessary to saluation, &c. Scripture, Luther, and all doctors of sound Iudgment think thus:

               And thus much for the controuersy it self, which S. Francis vnderstandeth not. But if I would stand vpon alleaging the infinite sentences of other protestants quite opposite and contradictory to that flattery of good workes which Sr. Francis heer and in other places of his Wastword vseth for deluding the people, I should neuer make an end, for in this they are as contrary one to another as in any other point.

preface or preparation to your poor defence of those vntruthes which are obiected against yow, wherin also yow discredit your self not a litle by bringing in other impertinent and forged matters to fil vp paper and help out withal, and among other of certayne deuised chalenges of disputation said to be made on your side by Iohn Husse in the councel of Constance, and by Martin Luther at VVormes and Augusta, and by Simon Grinae

                   easily see, what credit yow haue gayned by bringing them in.
               But when yow come to your defence it  self of the first two vntruthes obiected against yow,Cap. 5. by the Warder, to wit, that we hold, reading of scriptures in any vulgar tongue, whatsoeuer for heresy, & that for this cause only we brādle men to the slaughter, how do yow stand (Syr Francis) in this defence? do yow bring any one sufficient proof at all, for any one of these two absurdityes? The warder setteth downe a plaine & sensible discourse, how & in what languages, scriptures are permitted to al, as

also why and vpon what causes, reasons, arguments or vtilitie, of what hurt or necessity our Churche hath, or ought to make restraint or limitation therof to some who are not to profit therby?
                     
                        •
                     eaping ouer the aduersaryes cheef matter. which considerations (conteyning indeed the substance and very sinewes of this whole controuersy) yow (Syr knight) like a good Encounterer, do leap ouer without answering any one word, vrging only against vs for the second point of this controuersy, that some of your people haue byn examined sometymes or called in question for suspition of heresy, for that against order and commandment of their superiours, and without licence they haue taken vpon them to read and interpret the sacred scriptures in vulgar languages and that herof followeth (say yow) that we hold the very act it self of reading scriptures to be heresy, which how fond a sequel it is, euery man of meane vnderstanding conceyueth, and yow are made ridiculous for this fond inference by diuers examples alleadged in other things more cleere to all men.
               
                   And then furthermore wheras it liketh yow to be pleasant with the Warder, affirming that by adding (only) to your words (that for only reading of scriptures men were brandled to the slaughter) he made one ly of his owne while he sought to proue thesame against yow the said one ly is redoubled vpon your self, by shewing that, only is fond in your owne words, and consequently, that this word only hath not proued one ly against the warder,

but two or three lies against your self.
               And all this (as I said) is handled in your  preamble to this second Encounter,Forged maximes obtruded by the knight. the bulk and corps wherof consisteth (as yow know) in the verifying of foure other false propositions forged by your self, & assigned for grounds rules, and Maximes of our Religion, which are nothing so, to wit that we hold ignorance to be the mother of deuotion and that lay men must not medle with matters of religion, and that the Pope or any Priest comming from him, is to be obayed though he teach blasphemies: and finally that our cheef remedy against all sinnes consisteth in buying of pardons, &c. In defence of which obtruded positions how yow behaue your self, and what your carriage is, both by flying euery where from the true state of the question, cogging & dissembling and bringing in other odde matters litle or nothing concerning the controuersy it self, and by other such sleights and fhifts,See cap. 7.9.12.14. &c. I may not heer stand to repeat agayne but do remit the Reader, to that which is written in euery chapter of this affayre, yet cannot I but put yow in mynd, & the Reader also, that all defaults may better be borne and digested, then wilful corruptions and falsifications of authors, whome yow alleadge, I meane eyther in words yow cite, or in sense when yow alleadg them quite contrary to their owne meaning, purpose and drift, as yow are often shewed to haue done in sundry places, and vpon fundry occasions, wherof some we shal take the payne to repeat breefly in this

Bede, as though he should allow and testifie the promiscuous reading of holy scriptures in vulgar lāguages in his dayes, the truth being nothing so, but rather the quite contrary appearing by his wordes, and no lesse violēce are yow declared to vse in thesame place to Arnobius an ancīent author,Ibid. 9. nu 7. as though he had reproued the pious vse of Christian Images, wheras indeed he speaketh only and expressely of idols made Gods among Gentils, the title also of his book concealed by yow, being Aduersus gentes.
               
               
                   S. Chrisostome also is prooued to haue byn egregiously misused by yow in the 9. chapter,Cap. 9. nu. 1

                     . not only by peruerting his whole sense and meaning in the matter, for which yow alleadge him, but by cutting of also and mangling his very words and sentences alleadged; about which point, the Warder noteth no fewer, then 8. seueral abuses and falsifications in that place, and not vnlyke iniury is shewed to be

offered also to Index expurgatorius Hispanicus in thesame place, concerning the note obiected by yow in your answere,Cap. 9. nu. 15. 
                  deleatur dictio solumodò in Gregory Nissen his sentence, where yow both conceale the reason alleadged by the Index of that deletion or putting out, to wit, for that it was an error in the coppy and wholy from the authors argument, drift and meaning in that place, as also for that yow father that sentence vpon Gregory Nissene, which is none of his as there is shewed.
               But of all other your dishonorable dealing  (Syr Francis) in this kynd of abusing authors;Cap. 10. that doth most exceed, which yow do vse in the 10. Chapter against that holy renowned man S. Tho. of Cāterbury,Falsificatiōs against S. Tho. of Canterbury. where yow ioyne perfidiously with Iohn Fox your maister (the most shamlesse corrupter of authors that euer perhaps took pen in hand) to disgrace that worthy Saint and Prelate, both in his person and cause with the king; and for that yow are oftē taken & attaynted of this trick throughout the whole said tenth chapter and in the other that ensueth (especially where yow are shewed to falsifie most egregiously Caesarius Heislerbacius about S. Thom. his miracles) I shal not need to set downe heer more particulars,Cap. 11. nu. 12.13. &c. but rather wil end, putting yow in mynd only therby to mooue you a scruple (yf it might be) of these many and notorious corruptions and falsifications vsed by yow, and your said scholmaister Iohn Fox concerning the faigned poysoning of king Iohn by a monk,

and the absolution for the fact before hand, in which narration there are so many shamelesse impostures vsed by yow two combyned companions in lying,About the poysoning of K. Iohn sup. Cap. 15. as I persuade my self the reuewing therof wil make yow blush, or at leastwayes your modest reader for yow: & yf he loue his soule he wil take heed of yow and yours for the tyme to come. Aud so for breuities sake I wil passe no further in this recitall, but only vse a word or two of aduise to your procter O.E. and so an end.
               
                   Neyther yet wil I enter into any more particulars with him at this tyme,About the minister O. E. for that this admonition would grow ouerlong, and I am ful wearied already with repeating so much drosse of corrupted myndes, that haue no conscience what they say or affirme: but yet assure your self that this minister is farre worse then the knight in shamelesse manner of proceeding, though somwhat more wary in citations, and he that wil know him or take a scantling of his turbulent spirit in wryting, let him read, the sixt, eight, and thirteene Chapters of this encounter, where he is dealt withall alone, and singled into his Ierkin (to vse his owne phrase) and many of his tricks discouered and layd open, and yf by this examen and by the rest of the former Encounter and the Epistles going before, the man come not to be sufficiently knowne,A nevv match for O. E. in hand. then shal I remit me to that which after also is to ensue, especially in the seueral answere to his new chalenges, which I vnderstand some frend of

myne, seeing my present lettes & occupations is like inough to take in hand, and to buccle with him alone singulari certamine; which yf my frend do performe, as O.E. himself desyreth and craueth I dare fortel (hauing considered wel the subiect which they are to discusse) that O. E. wilbe left in a very poor pickle, and made a ridiculous companion, as one that vnderstandeth neyther himself nor his aduersary, nor the true state of the questiō he handleth, and yf this proue not soo (the match going forward) then let me be condemned both of temerity and vanity for making that prophesy so long before hand.
               And so to the proof I remit me, beseeching  in the meane space the moderate and indifferent reader which hath care of his saluation, and readeth not so much for curiosity, contention or loue to partes and faction, as sincerely to be instructed in matter of truth concerning religion, that he weigh seriously with himself what good meaning or conscience can there be in such men as vse so many fraudes and vtter so manifest falshoods, as in this our answere we haue plainely demonstrated; and then (good reader) when thow hast once discouered this point of singular importance, which is, that truthe indeed is not sought by them that pretēd to seek truth, nor religion by them that treat of religion, but only that shifts are sought to make a shew of saying euer somwhat, then I doubt not but thou wilt resolue with thy self, what

is behooful for thee to do, for sauing of thy owne soule, not leauing it vpon the waues of vncertayne disputes and altercations of men, but staying it vpon the sure rock of Christs Catholike and visible Churche, which is left and appointed as an infallible stay, for all men, wherunto I implore his heauenly grace and deuyne assistance.
            
            
               AN ADDITION BY the publisher of this book; wherin he sheweth first a reason why these two Encounters are set forth alone: then the difference he findeth in the wryters and their wrytings: thirdly how a man may vse this which heer is said to the decision of any Controuersy of our tyme.

                   THREE things do I promise (good Christian Reader) as yow see in the title of this my addition, which I shal endeauour to performe with the greatest breuity and perspicuity that I may.

                  unters grew to so great a bulk, as of themselues

they seemed to be sufficient for one book, especially considering the many difficulties that we haue in printing greater volumes in these dayes, and all commodity of our owne countrey prints, printers and other helpes being debarred vs.
               
                   Wherfore vpon these and other lyke reasons I began to deale effectually with the author of this work that he would be content to yeild vnto the publishing of these two Encounters alone, promissing him that as the other should come to be ready and thorowly polished (which I hope wilbe very shortly) I would set them forth also eyther all togeather or two or three Encoūters in a book, as these go according to the quantity or bignesse which they shal grow vnto. And this is so much as is needful to be sayd of this first point.
               
                   The second also may be dispached with the lyke breuity,The 2. point of this addition. which is about the difference of the wryters and wrytings of these Encounterers, for so much as I do not meane to stand vpon all differēces obserued by me in reading ouer their books, but to note some few only, referring me also in these to that which before hath byn set downe in the Encounters themselues, especially in the seueral admonissions and warnings ensuing vpon euery Encounter, and conteyning as it were a breef recapitulation of the whole, only then I wil say that two notorious differences me thinketh I haue obserued in cōferring these books and wryters togeather.
               
                  The first is touching truthe and falshood, playne dealing and shifting,The first differēce about true dealing & falshood. discouered almost in euery leaf of the former Encoūters, which is a diffe
                     •
                  ence of somuch quality, as whersoeuer it is found on the worser part it ought greatly to mooue, and make deep impression in the Reader, that is careful of his owne saluation, for that the matters in controuersy cō
                  cerning true faith, being of the highest importance that may be to our soule and euerlasting good or hurt, euery man ought to be attent, & whersoeuer he findeth falshood or deceyt to be wilfully and purposely intended, and that it cannot be excused by error or ignorance or heat of speach or other lyke infirmities there he ought to stay his foot & stand fast and not to passe further without firme resolution neuer to beleue him agayne.
               And for that in all the reply both of Sr.F. and O.E. his defendant, I do not find that the VVarder is so much as charged to my remembrance and much lesse conuinced of any one such wilful falsification as before I haue alleaged, and that both the knight and minister are accused almost in euery leaf of this crime, and that with such manifest proofes and demonstrations as I see not how possibly they can quite themselues: here hence I do inferre that it importeth exceedingly euery wise and discreet Reader to remember wel this difference.
               Another difference also there is not a litle  to be marked in the very substance of their

wrytings,The 2. difference, idle or profitable matter handled. concerning the profit, or losse of tyme which the reader may reap by perusing them ouer, for that Sr.F. and O.E. if yow look attentiuely into their books, do treat nothing eyther methodically or substantially throughout their replies but following the Warder vp and downe, do wrāgle here and iangle there, taking exceptiōs against these or those words, without handling any one point learnedly or with substance throughout all their whole discourses, neyther cōfuting soundly their aduersaries, nor confirming wel their owne parts, so as when a man hath red ouer their whole books, he remayneth, with more doubts and darknes, then before, feeling only his spirit of incredulity and contradiction more increased by this reading, but his braynes more weakened and wearied, and his vnderstanding lesse cleer then before; and I appeale to the indifferent Readers testimony, whether it be so or no, wherof yet we that are Catholykes ought not to complayne but rather in a certayne manner to reioyce at these effects as lesse hurtful, for so much as it must needs driue many from reading their books and weary others, before they be half way in them, hauing neyther order nor substance, and those that perseuer to the end remayne as wise as before, prouing the prouerb to be true concerning these books: Ex stultis insanos.
               
               
                   But on the other side I fynd all contrary for first I see that of a wyld vagrant discourse

which the watchman Sir F. made at the first vnder the name of a VVatch-word wherin there was neyther head nor heele,S.F. vvachvvord vvithout order or substance. top nor toe order nor coherence, but only a certayne loose inuectiue against all sort of Catholyke men and their religion, the Warder brought it into a good method of 8. seueral Encounters conteyning so many principal heads & branches of the dispersed points therin touched which the said knight and his Minister O. E. though they bee drawne to follow in their replies, yet do they returne agayne to thesayd vagrancy or inanity rather in the matters they handle, treating no one thing substantially as before hath byn sayd, wheras the Warder by a contrary spirit draweth all things to some profitable & serious m
                     •
                  tter for the reader to make his gayne therof,The substantial dealing of the VVarder. by which industry of his are come to be handled so many weighty and important points of cōtrouersies as aboue in the table prefixed before these Encounters are to be seene, & albeit the breuity of this reioynder would not permit to hādle euery one of them so largely as they might, yet is there sufficiētly said therof for framing any intelligent mānes iudgment therin or in any other points of cō
                  trouersy, as presently more at large shalbe declared.
               And further for a special proof of this point  I had once purposed (besydes the particular matters hādled before) to haue ioyned to these two Encounters a seueral Treatese of 3. conuersions of our land from Paganisme to ChristianA treatese o
                        •
                      of 3. conuersions of England.
                  
religiō by the special help of the Roman Sea and Bishoppes therof, which treatese conteyning some 9. or 10. chapters was framed by the Warder in his reioynder to the 7. Encounter against S.F. & his fellowes, who deny or diminish by all meanes possible this singular benefit receaued from Rome, and for that this treatese (though but a parcel of the answere to that Encounter) lyked me exceeding wel, and seemed a thing worthy to be printed a part without expecting his place or turne, when the sayd 7. Encoūter shalbe published, I had thought with licence of the author to haue ioyned it to this woork but being dissuaded afterward, and considering the treatese to be of 
                     •
                  ufficient bignesse to go by it self alone I haue so caused it to be printed, which I wish thee (gentle Reader) to procure & read with attention for that I doubt not but the variety of the matter therin handled wil delight thee, and the cleare deduction of Cath. faith from the beginning within this Iland wil greatly instruct thee, especially being conferred and compared, as it is, with Iohn Fox his new Churche brought downe by leapes from one broken heretike to another, though neuer so different in tyme, place, function and other circumstances, yea though they were contrary to him and among themselues, in most points of their faith and beleef.
               
                   The third point mentioned before, is how any man, by that which is set downe & disputed in these two Encounters, may resolue

himself thorowly in all matters that ly in controuersy betwene vs and Protestants at this day,The 3. point of this addition hovv to determine. a point no doubt of very great importance if it be wel considered, and greatly to be wished by all those that loue their owne saluation & do not read books as some are wont to do for curiosity, or passing only the tyme, but to profit therby, and once to be resolued in that which is only truthe & absolutely necessary to their eternal good, wherof so long as they remayne doubtful, irresolute, wauering, and seeking only, they haue no benefit, and cōsequently if they should dy in that state their case no doubt were most daungerous and lamentable, they being in the number of them of whome S.

                   But on the other side, Catholike doctors considering the great and high importance of this point and that the farre greater part of christian people that are in the world haue not commodity to read controuersyes by themselues,

Athanasius and the councel of Nice) cannot be saued, except they beleeue all and euery part and parcel of the Catholike faith, they haue taught them another more short and sooner way left by Christ and his Apostles, for auoyding this gulfe of damnatiō, which way is to know and beleeue fide explicita, that is,

                  Ibid. cap. 7.before that simplicity of beleeuing maketh the common people most safe.
               Wherfore according to this selfsame way  also,The short & sure vvay of Cath. beleef. the said Catholike doctors do teach vs how that in these troublesome and contentious tymes of disputes and controuersyes, a man that is in errors or doubts may come to be a perfect Catholike in resoluing himself vpō the truthe of very few particular questiōs and controuersyes, beleeuing the rest in gene

               To this resolution when any man ariueth, and is content in these things which he knoweth not, to follow the councel of S. Paule,
                  2. Cor. 10. which is to captiuate his vnderstanding to the obedience of Christ and his faith, taught in the Catholike Churche, he is now at a good stay, and may be held for a sound Catholike though in many particular points, he

know not the reasons to and fro, but may afterward informe himself as tyme and ability, and other occasions shal permit him: standing fast and firme in this principle that he wil not guide his faith by his owne iudgment knowledge or persuasiō, nor of any other particular man, but only by the receyued sentence, and determination of that visible Catholike Churche,Matth. 16. Ioh. 14. Marc vlt. 1. Tim. 3. 1. Ioh. 2. to whome only Christ hath promised the assurance of his holy spirit, and in which Churche though his promise of diuine help were not, yet are there so many humane helpes of true knowledge also, considering their number, vniuersality, continuance, descent, and consent, as euery wise man would rather cast himself vpon them, then vpon any particular sect of new vpstarts that want all these helpes, and agree neyther with themselues nor others.
               
                   Wel then yow wil aske me perhaps; what are those few principalle pointes, which being wel vnderstood would suffice to make a man a good Catholike? Wherto I answere with S. Augustine and other holy Fathers, that one only were sufficient yf a man hold it perfectly,Aug. lib. 2. ca. 25. cont. Ep. G

which and where is the Catholike christian Churche at this day, I may referre the reader to diuers substantial treateses handled in this book before, wherby he may easily resolue himself in that matter.
               As for example the Treatese before set  downe in the beginning of the first Cap. 2.Encounter, who are properly Catholiks, and who are heretiks by the old lawes of auncient Catholike Emperors made expressely against heretiks. And if it so fal out,VVho are Catholykes. that all points set downe in those lawes do agree fully to protestants and nothing at all to vs that are called Catholiks at this day, but rather that we agree fully with those that then were called Catholikes, and distinguished by that name and nature, then is it euident where the Catholike Churche standeth, seing that the body of Catholike people maketh the true Catholike Churche.
               In like manner, there is another treatese in  the same Encounter about,About the rule of faith. 
                  The rule of faith wherby men ought to be guided in all contro

dayes haue neyther this nor any other certayne rule at all of agreement in faith, beside the particular decrees of seueral countreys where this or that sect doth beare sway: then is it euident, that where this certayne rule i

            THE THIRD TABLE OF CERTAINE NOTORIOVS SHIFTS, SLIEGHTES, DECEITS and impostures vsed by Syr F. and O. E. in their answers and replyes.
            
               MANY and sundry are the deuises, sleights and shifts which the pouerty and necessity of the protestant cause doth force he

                  •
                make a certaine breef Catalogue of the most ordinary and knowne shifts, that do euery where occurre, and by them yow may ghesse of the rest, and of our protestants whole manner of wryting and answering our books.
            The first is to passe ouer and dissemble with silence  the principal and most substantial points of their aduersaryes wrytings and to answere more largely other points that are of farre lesse difficulty, wherof the reader shal find many complaints made by vs, throughout this whole work.
            The second shift is, when the whole matter cannot  be dissembled nor put of by silence, then to giue as it were a nod vnto it, answering it only in general by a word or two, and then to passe on as though all were sufficiently answered, wherof yow shal find store of examples noted by vs in this our answere.
            A third shift is, when they are charged with any fault  committed, not so much to defend themselues, as to

accuse others of the like fault on out side, as though this did cleer them, as for example when Sir F. in the first Encounter is argued for absurd flattering her Maiestie and the State, he telleth vs againe, for his excuse, that Canonists in Rome, do much more flatter the Pope. And againe in the second Encounter, when he is accused to auouch many lyes, he obiecteth to vs againe, that Friars were braue liars in king Richard the 2. his dayes, and other such like.
            
                A fourth shift, is running behynd the cloth of State, to wit when out aduersaries hauing the tyme and state fauorable vnto them, do vpō euery litle occasion, couer themselues with that buckler. As for example when they haue be haued themselues in temperatly against vs in words, and do eyther feare or feel a round reply, they step presently behynd the cloth of state putting
                  •
                both her Maiestie & the common welth betwene them and vs; as though we might not answere them, but by impugning the other.
            
                The fifth shift is to repeat their aduersaryes words stil with some vntruthe or aduantage, altering thesame for their purpose and yet setting them downe in a different letter, as though they were their owne words, of which fraud I am forced to complaine often though more of the minister then of the knight in this behalf.
            
                The sixt shift is, that when they name authors, and alleage their testimonies against vs, and yet would be lo
                  •
               h to haue them examined, their custome is neuer lightly to quote book, work or chapter, but only the author in general, leauing to vs to seek out, where it is to be found, why, how, or in what sense it was spoken, yf it were spoken at all:
            
                The seauenth shift is to alleadge authors contrary to their owne meaning, and to their whole discourse and purpose, which could not be vnknowen to them, that alleaged them; And this is very malitious dealing and oftentymes vsed as after yow shal see proued.
            
               The 8. shift, or deceit, or rather imposture is, not  only to alleage authors against their owne intētiōs, but wittingly also to corrupt their very woords, & text, leauing out somthings and adding, and altering others, as by examination yow shal find.
            The nynth shift is a kynd of bold impudēcy in  denying things notoriously knowne to all men. As for example to deny (as Sir F. and O. E. do) that there is any substantial point of difference in religion, betwene Lutherans, Suinglians & Caluinists: or that the Protestants of our tyme haue byn troublesome or rebellious against their lawful Catholike princes, or that there is any diuision at all, or disiunction betweene Puritans and protestants in England. And the like.
            The tenth shift is impertinent and ridiculous  answering matters wholy from the purpose, as for example the question being whether England be blessed at this day by change of Catholike religion? Sir F. answereth that she was once blessed, though she be not now. And many other such examples yow shal find.
            The eleuēth shift is, to alleage rather matter expressely  against themselues and their fellowes, when they are sore pressed, then to seeme to say nothing: As when O.E. alleageth the constitution of Archbishop Arundel in England, about reading scriptures in a vulgar tongue quite contrary to himself. And againe thesame man hauing seene and read, that Sir F. in the 6. Encounter affirmeth S. Augustine to haue said, that it neuer pleased any good man in the Churche, that heretiks should be put to death, yet he alleageth S. Augustine to the cōtrary, as praysing the punishing of heretiks by the Imperial lawes; and such other like.
            The tweluth and last shift (for I wil go no further) is plaine cosenage, falsifying and lying, and

this vpon euery occasion: wherof there are so many offered, and the kynds and formes are so diuers, as it were ouerlong to alleadge particular examples for euery one, yet by those few that do ensue, the reader may make a ghesse of the rest, especially yf they should be taken out of all the eight Encounters, as those that follow are out of two only.
