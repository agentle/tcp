               IN those dayes (right worshipful)
when the world was
vnfourmed, orders vnprouided,
and lawes not established,
but al sortes of men and
ages, enioyed and embraced their own licentious
libertie: Before Princes tooke power,
Magistrates authoritie, and Rulers gouernement:
At what time arte was vnknowen,
miseries vnsearched, and studies neglected,
the people of all Nations liued in beastly and
brutish maner, folowing their own fancie as a
God, and their wil as reason. But after it pleased
God (of his inestimable prouidence) to
illumine the shadowed sight of the world, and
of his diuine pleasure, to inspire and breathe
into certaine of his Creatures, the prudent

knowledge of sapience skill, then wisedom begat
pollicie, pollicie diligence, and diligence
a desire to knowe, so that the woorking of the
one, founde out the nature of thinges, and the
experience of the other, inuented artes for
the vse and practise of the same, whereby
Lawes after were confourmed, Iustice feared,
and rawe thinges ripened, Rules regarded,
Sciēces searched, and misteries vnfoulded.
At this time the worlde began to bud
the blossomes of a delectable fruite, and sowe
the seede of a happie haruest (if worldly delightes
may so lawefully be termed) for euerie
man nowe delighted to excell, all sortes
embraced knowledge, and eche degree laboured
to profite his countrie. Yea all men so allowed
labours, and contemned idlenes, that
immediatly all the worlde flowed with liberall
artes and scientiall Artificers. As Philo

And so farre they searched, that some foūd
out Astronomie, some Astrologie, some Cosmographie,
and suche like, some one thing,
and some an other, so that in fewe yeares ther

seemed nothing left in nature vnsearched or
vnknowen. Among whiche Physicke (whom
it pleased God to predestinate a succour and
aide to the vniuersall worlde (though not at
first or presently, yet in space of time, among
manie other thinges, as a princely pearle) was
created, the Theorick part, wherof the most

short space it was so sought, searched, and experienced
in euerie Nation, and so brightlye
displaied her beames to eche Region, that as
Princes could not ceasse to praise and studie
it, neither could the common people leaue of
to worshippe it, but extolled the Artistes as
Gods, and embraced the fruites therof as incomparable.

that he coulde neuer procure him

A thousand moe examples could I inferre,
wherein the very Pagans seeme to excell

and encouraging all willing fauourers of
learning and sciences. But affection (at this
daye) so ruleth the roste, and disdain stirreth

such contempt (among the bleting babes

or slight escape, they deride without ceassing,
and a learned woorke doth euen sawe their
mindes asunder. For this cause right worshipful)
some perhappes would demaunde of
me, how I dare put penne to paper to entreat
of anie matter or parte of Physicke, considering
the scrupelous state of time present, together
with the barrennes of my witte, and
want of learning, or laye in my dishe this saying
of Terence.

neither the curious crackes of the enuious
can staie me, nor yet the bragging boultes of
the vaine glorious, are of force to holde me
backe, since I am moued hereto by three notable
causes.The first cause. The first is, to pleasure my coū
               trie
and friendes (amongest whom your worship
is chiefe,) and therefore some fruite of
my pooer painfull practise, are due vnto you,
hoping also, (as other more learned do in the
publishing of their bookes) that these fewe lines
(partly by the study of other good authors,
partly also by mine own experiēce collected)
may vnder your worships protection be defended
against Sicophantes and faultfinders, of

you, whose witte, prudence, and authoritie (in
this countrie to this respect) is of great force
among vs. This litle labour therefore it may
please your worshippe to accept, as the hartie
present of a friend poore and faithfull, to you
offred this present yeare, of your new Office,
to be a monument to posteritie of that good
will I beare towardes you in woordes, and
would declare the same in deedes (if habilitie
were correspondent to my will.)The secōd cause.
Another cause is, for that I protest my selfe to haue set
forwarde and finished this my present enterprise,
deuoyde altogether (as knoweth God)
of hautie minde or stout courage, but with so
simple and zelous harte, that neither ill will
with all his mischieuous dartes, vainglorie,
with his pranked pikes, nor enuie, with his sodain
shot, are once able to geue me repulse or
touche.The third cause. And the last cause is, the remembraunce
of Aristotle
               Aristole. his saying, Bonū quo
communius tanto prestantius, So that to
pleasure and profite, other men is best, and
moste to be desiered, but seeing (as the prouerbe
monisheth,) Non datur cuique adire
Corinthū, I shall thinke my penne and time
well employed, if I may profite some men.
            One sorte of people there are (and that is the

learned) who are cōmonly geuen to disdaine
the reading ouer of suche simple collections,
chiefly of this part of Physicke, fulfilling the
common saying, Aquila nōcapit muscas
and such peraduenture will litle regarde, or
lesse esteme it then the meaner sort (to whom
this booke is chiefly left) who (I know) wil not
disdaine or despise the perusing of this treatise
of Chirurgerie, as necessarie as the other
(more exquisite) though some of late more
precise then wise haue fondly affirmed, foolishlye
feined, and frantickelye faced that
the Chyrurgian hathe not to deale in Physicke,
small curtesie is it to breake faithful
friendshippe or attonement, but it is mad
dotage, to parte that which can not be separated.
Howe can Phisicke be praised, and
Chirurgerie discommended? can any man
despise Chyrurgerie, and not defame Physicke?
no sure, he that speaketh euill of the
one, slaundereth both, and he that robbeth the
one, spoileth the other. For although they be
at this time made twoo distincte Artes, and
the Artistes seuerally named, yet sure, the
one can not woorke without some aide of the
other, nor the other practise without the help
of both. For further assuraunce whereof,

               amitie. Without diet (I saie) and purgation,
Vlcus sordidum, or Cacoaethes (with other
like diseases) may not be healed. Herehence
commeth it diuers times, that many men almoste
in euerie countrie, decaie and perishe
in the Arte of Chyrurgerie, by the ignoraunt
dealinges of Chyrurgians, vnskilfull in Physicke.
Hereby also it commeth, that so many
Runnagates and Idle liuers, make such daily
incursions, and ofte entringes into those worthy
and misterious sciences, who durst not
route if they were at vnitie, but that can not
be, so long as this errour is mainteined, that
the one ought not to participate with the other,
for so neither of them can be perfecte.
Seing that thing is onely perfect, Cui ne minima
pars quidem deest. Great ruthe and
pitie it is, that so many idle Idiottes and Erronious
Asses, are permitted to practise this
Arte of great difficultie, that requireth so
many helpes and sūdrie knowledge of things,
as the nature and names of diseases, Simples,
Rootes, Plantes, partes of mans bodie, and a

thousand thinges moe, whereof the greatest

make commonly twoo moe, and the best successe

               And profitable practises,
               may commendations gaine.
            
            
               If things which famous mē haue found,
               doe most of all excell:
               And that which needfull is deserue,
               to winne and weare the bell.
            
            
               If vertue thou wilt truely scan,
               canst thou ought better haue:
               Then that which saues a perishing man,
               euen from the gredie graue.
            
            
               If thou wouldst seeke what moste of all,
               doth passing things attain:
               Then that regard which from the death,
               so many doth detain.
            
            
               And Phisicke sithe it yeeldeth such,
               as thou canst aptly craue:
               
                  A sightly seate aboue the rest,
               of force it needes must haue.
            
            
               For if thou wander searchingly,
               from East vnto the West:
               Thou shalt perceiue that euerie where,
               for Physicke there is rest.
            
            
               More profitable nothing is,
               (although the world abounde:)
               And nothing more that man can need,
               in all the worlde so rounde.

               With such like plentie very huge,
               which seemeth good to thee.
            
            
               Yet if with sicknes thou be grieud,
               and eke to pain subiect:
               What will auaile thy plenty store,
               can it thy health direct?
            
            
               Lo Physicke can the so much geue,
               if thou vnto her lore
               Attentiue be, and crased corps
               before her doe deplore.

               this art did vndertake.
            
            
               Examples many doe abound,
               whereby a man may see:
               If that no Physicke could be founde,
               great were our miserie.
            
            
               Who could the force of herbes attaine,
               or sicknes well discerne?
               Who could diseases with their names,
               that be so many learne?
            
            
               It would exceede all humaine wittes,

               It would appeare vnpossible,
               to all that dwell on lowe.
            
            
               
               Sith then such wonders it doth worke,
               of force we must maintaine:
               And loue the same exceedingly,

            BEfore the gratious goodnes
of God, had created
medicine on the earth, before
(I saye) he vnfoulded
ye misterie therof to worldly
wightes, and mortall creatures, no mā
knewe what plantes could preuayle, not

vnknowen, moste gummes vnfound, an

all seedes vnsought. (To conclude) all
natures benefites (that nowe so ofte preserue
and keepe mans healthful state frihurt)
lay hugely heaped in the boisterous

bowels of confused Chaos, distaunt from
light, absent from knowledge, and farre
from doing good. Whiche nowe (being
brought to light by the same almightie

to the sicke, ease to the painfull, pleasure
to the sorrowfull, & health to the healthfull,
but ofttimes as we dailie proue (euē
by fine force) encountreth the merciles
might of fell disseases, and preuenteth the
dreadful dartes of death (whilest the skilfull

diuelishe dissemblers, as (studie onlye to
deceiue the worlde) inuente willingly to
embase the worthy arte, and seke shamefully
to slaūder the godly studentes therof.
As it is not vnknowen vnto you (therfore
needeles for me to tell) howe Physicke
and Chyrurgerie haue in time past
bene renowmed throughout the worlde:
No more is it to you ignoraunt, how litle
it is in these dayes regarded, which if we

compare time present with that is past,
we shall see and plainely perceiue it, rather
despised (as needles) then regarded
as necessarie, such slender iudgement and
fond affection raigneth at this daye, and
so is the worlde vpside down turned: that
what so afore time hath ben best accōpted
of, the same is now the basest, that which
was principall, is (at this time) ye poorest,
and the chiefest become lest estemed. In
this case (therefore) as I must needes
blame the fickle state of the worlde and
moste of al accuse the fraile estate of mās
nature (I meane the cōmon sorte of people,
who are always readie to turne with
euerie blast of Eolus wauering wynde

               causes) So can I not altogether
excuse thē, vnto whom authoritie is
geuen, to establishe orders and reforme
malefactours with the causes of offence,
whose onely slacknes, and vntimely clemencie
is the greatest encouragement
that offenders haue. I speake not this as
seeming to cōtroll your worships (knowing
you will rightly conceiue, it cōmeth
of a zelous harte) but if the loue of oure
coūtrie, & eminent desolatiō (which might

happē by want of this arte) doe not draw
vs all hereunto, yet (at the least, if wee
loue our selues) we are forste to crie out
vpon abuses, deplore double dealing, and
seke for spedie reformation. Uerie harde
it were for suche a rowte of Rogishe liuers,
so boldly to practise, and to fill all
places with the slaunderous shauinges
of their deuelishe practises, were they not
permitted of some (in authoritie) & winked
at of suche as should them punishe.
I doe not a litle marueile also, howe and
by what meanes or merit, so many gette
their authorities or licenses to practise,
when as in examination they (not onlye)
shewe them selues ignoraunt Asses, and
in their workes bussardly beyardes, but
also of them selues altogether disposed to
incontinencie, and dayly dissimulation,
without either feare of God, or obediēce
to their Prince, I (my self) knowe them
at this daie, the moste beastly deceiuers,
and licentious liuers that euer profest anie

               YE learned dames that doe delite,
               in sciences deuine:
               Refuse not now to taste a while,
               this sacred sap of mine.
            
            
               Which I abundantly doe yeelde,
               to euery man eche where:
               Like Tellus with her fertile fruites,
               when Autumne doth appeare.
            
            
               Or Nilus when it ouerflowes,
               doth fatte and feede the soile:
               Whiche after that aboundant fruites,
               doth yeeld withouten toile.
            
            
               Who can depaint the passing ioye,
               that bird and beast doe taste:

               To appease the pinching smart.

               that mortall men oppresse:
               And doe consume the crased corps,
               by me they haue redresse.

               And these our dayes can well declare,
               howe many men I saue:
               Were not for me which had bene shut,

               for pleasure counted chief:

               and all thinges goe to wracke.
            
            
               How should the shippes yt shreads ye seas,
               in darke and trembling tide,
               From perishing preserued be,
               without a skilfull guyde?

               Can not in steadie staie long stande,
               but fall to languishement.
            
            
               Then how should man which subiect is
               to all infirmitie:
               Without the helpe of Phisickes arte,
               in sicknes saued be?

               Of such as haue no skill at all,

               In haste come with your helping hand,

               They trotte about from place to place,
               as Frogges hoppe in the rayne:
               And thus this noble arte God wotte,
               they doe naught els but stayne.

               Such successe haue those in the end,
               which practise without skill:
               Where one or twoo by happe they heale,
               a hundreth moe they kill.
            
            
               This is their trade to promise helpe,

               THe thing where any cunning lies,

               without an others paine.
            
            
               And where no cunning is, to say,
               that cunning doth abounde:

               it hath a further reache.

praised: No more doth
it behoue suche lasie liuers, as suppe
gaines without sorrowe, and enioy pleasure
without toyle, to barke at other
mens labours, to deride the diligent,
scorne the skilfull, and disdaining those
who neuer thinke their bodies busied in
helping others, esteme their wittes weakened
to further manie, nor accompte
their mēbers martyred (for any paines)
to profite their coūtrie, but would God
such (as be lulled with the sleepie songes
of selfloue, and rocked in the lustles cradle
of securitie) would ether rise to light,
and see their lothsome liues, or els wallowe
their fill in sloughtfull delightes,

and suffer the diligent to escape their
dreaming partes, but since no writer euer
had that hap, nor any authour that
fortune, since (I saye) that Grecian swete
Mecaenas, and that eloquent Romaine
oratour, could (in no wise) shunne their
saucie charmes: Let my barbarous brain
and wilfull penne, neuer hope of looke
to purchase prayse of all men. If therefore
(gentle Reader) thy modest mynde
be any thing addicted to the commendation
of vertue, banishement of vice,
augmenting of scientiall knowledge, or
thy nature enclined to loue lighte, and
hate darknes, or desier to knowe the secret
shapes of nature, then praise painefull
practisers, commende cunning artificers,
and welwillers to worthie professions,
ceasse neuer to encourage, and
that the rather, because al writers doe accompte

               Let him doe what he may:

            VLCERS IN
generall.
            The definition of an Vlcer,
and the difference
betvveene an Vlcer
and a wounde.
            AS my chiefest intention
is in this parte,
to entreat of Ulcers, so
do I purpose first to define
what an Ulcer is,Vlcꝰ quid sit.
whiche after the minde
of Auicen, is a solution of continuitie in
the fleshe, conteining corruption and pu
               
                  •
               refaction.
For by the name of an Ulcer,
we vnderstande that separation of vnion,
whiche is not simple as a wounde, but is

                  •
               lwaye founde annexed with other dispo
               
                  •
               itions
and accidentes, hindring the cure

                  •
               hereof.Quid per nomē vlc. intelligatur. Whereupon it commeth, that
in Ulcer is to be vnderstanded as a com
               
                  •
               ound
affection, or vnnaturall motion:

Notwithstanding, no man is so ignoran
                  •
               
(bearing ye name of a Chirurgian) but he
knoweth, that in woundes also is contayned
certaine dispositions necessarily chaū
               cing:
as bignes, litlenes, streitnes, crookednes,
equalitie, inequalitie, depth and
height, &c. Whiche make the differences
in woundes.Discrimen inter vlcus & vulnus. To conclude therfore, that is
to be called as Ulcer, where as there is
corruption. And that a wounde, where (as
yet) there is no putrefaction. Of the like
opinion also is Corn, Celsus,
               Cor. Celsus. and in manner
also Hippocrates,
               Hippoc. affirming ye to be
a wounde which is yet new and bloudy, &
an Ulcer, when it is become olde or inueterate.
And thus farre as touching the
definition of an Ulcer, and the difference
betweene the Ulcer and the wounde: the
differences general with the acccidentes,
after followeth.
            
               The differences of Vlcers and vvherof
they be taken.
               THe differences of Ulcers are diuersly
taken, but especially of three causes,
viz. from the causes prouoking them, frō
the members, and from the accidentes or

dispositions ioyned with thē. Other take
them onely of two, as from the causes and
accidentes, and also from the natural dispositions
them selues, to whiche they are
enwrapped, and passe ouer those differences,
whiche are taken of the members or
labouringe partes, because they belong
not to an vniuersall treatise. These therefore
be the diuers sortes of Ulcers, & true
differences taken of the causes, that is to
wit, a virulent Ulcer, a corroding Ulcer,
a filthy rotten or putrified Ulcer, a hollowe
& depe Ulcer, and Ulcer full of holes
and a cancred Ulcer. And the differences
which do come of the accidētes & natural
dispositions, to which the woundes them
selues be ioyned, are also diuers. Which
of the Chirurgiās of later time are thus
described. viz. an Ulcer wt intēperatnes,
whiche ye 
                  Grecians call Discratū, a dolorous
Ulcer, an Ulcer with a swelling or
tumor against nature (commonly called
impostumation) a broken Ulcer, an Ulcer
ouergrowen with superfluous fleshe,
which ye 
                  Grecians call
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a hard
Ulcer, a cankred Ulcer, a hollowe vlcer,

                     •
                  n Ulcer corrupt at the bone, an Ulcer

with diuers separatiōs, & an Ulcer called
Cacoethes, which is a wicked, cruel, & very
hard Ulcer to be healed, and others of
that sorte. But these many and diuers differences
of Ulcers, are not supposed of
Galene to be true differences of Ulcers,
but only agreeings of other effectes with
the Ulcer, of which sorte are, the cankred
Ulcer, the ouergrowen, putrefied and hollowe
Ulcers. And the Ulcer with some
swelling, as the Ulcer called Phlegmonodes,
and Resipelatodes, or the cankred
rottennes, the inflāmation of bloude, the
canker, and residue of that sort, are of the
kinde of effectes besides nature, corrupting
the actions whiche seuerally and by
them selues may existe and bee. For that
thing (saith Galen) which can consiste seuerally,
shall neuer be the difference of an
other.
               Let this therefore be as a precepte and
rule, by whiche thou maiste discerne whether
the difference of an effect be any otherthing,
or the enwrapping of an other naturall
motion, but after an other sort. Also
the vexing and dolorous Ulcer, and
the filthie vlcer, are called (as it were certaine

differēces of vlcers whē as in deed
they are not true & proper differēces, but
the ioyning rather of an accident with an
vlcer. &c. In like sorte the Ulcer called
Vlcus cacochymon, is an Ulcer replenished
with euill iuyce, or troubled with a
rheumatick matter ther caused, being ioyned
with theffect. Many such therfore are
vsurped of common Chirurgians & Phisicians,
for the differēces of Vlcers which
are in deede no differences, but onely (as
Galene saith) binding together other dispositions,
or the effectes of that which is
compounded. The proper and true differences
of a simple Ulcer are taken of the
nature thereof. And that (saith Galen) is
a simple Ulcer, which doth only exist, that
is, wherto no other affect or accidēt is ioyned.Vndepropriae vlc. differ. sumendae.
It shall not therfore be a simple Ulcer
if any other part be exulcerated, or be

                     •
                  exed with a rheumatick matter, or euill

                     •
                  uyce, or altogether without natural tem
                  
                     •
                  erature,
full of hollownes. &c.
               Therefore the differences taken of the

                     •
                  ature of the vlcers are moste proper,Different. vlcerum sunt magis propriae. &

                     •
                  f the substaunce of the thing, and cōming

                     •
                  utwarde. They are taken of the substāce

of the thing whiche are brought from the
fourme & bignes or quātitie of ye diuisiō, &
from ye measure of space.Forma vlcerum. Frō the forme,
as the streight Ulcer, the Ulcer declined
or bowed, the rounde or compassed vlcer,
the wrythen and the crooked vlcer: from
the bignes of the diuision or quantitie, as
a great vlcer, a litle vlcer of the measures
or spaces, as a long vlcer, a short vlcer, a
broade vlcer, a narrowe vlcer, a highe vlcer,
or an vlcer in the toppe or height of any
parte, a depe vlcer, an equall vlcer, an
vnequall vlcer.
               And the differēces of the vlcers cōming
extrinsecall,Diffe. vlc. extrinsec. are taken of the time, of the
waye of generation, as all the vlcer or
scarce part thereof cannot be seen or beholden,
the differences of the tyme, as a
newe vlcer, or olde vlcer. Of the reason of
the generation, as a cut vlcer, a brokē vlcer,
an vlcer partly cut, partly broken. O
                     •
                  
the placing in thaffected part, as an vlcer
euidently appearing or out of sight, an vlcer
hidden within or not appearing. Also
an vlcer in the beginning of the muscle,
in the middest, or in the end of the muscle.
The differences of vlcers taken of the affected

place, though they are to be iudged.
vlcers, yet not (as Gal. saith) of their
owne propre nature, as the aforesayd differences
are taken: for the places wherein
the vlcers doe consiste are similar, and
organicall, therfore to shewe the differences
of places wherein the vlcer is, the diuision
must be after this sorte, from thaffected
place. An vlcer in the similar organick
or instrumentall part, deuiding also
the differences of vlcers in the similar
parte after this sorte. viz. Ulcers in the
veines, vlcers in the arteries, vlcers in ye
skinne, and vlcers in the muscles, for the
muscle and the similar part, is easie to be
discerned by sense. And the differences of
the affectes in the organicke parte, are of
this sorte. The vlcer of the eare, the vlcer
in the Iawes, the vlcer in the sharpe or
rough arterie, vlcer of the lunges, vlcer of
the brest, vlcer of the yarde, vlcer of the
fundament and seate, and so forthe in lyke
order discoursing the singuler partes of
the body, whiche wee call instrumentall.
And this is the complete and absolute diuision
of a simple and only vlcer, and of an
vlcer to whome no other affect is ioyned

in his differences taken of his propre nature.
Also if any affect or disposition doe
consiste by it selfe, as Phlegmon, Gangr
                        •
                     
                     na,
or putrefaction, there cannot the differences
of vlcers be taken thereby, or at
least bee so called properly. But for because
it is spokē of Galen at least in 600.
places, let vs not holde any cōtention vppon
the names.Non esse de nominibus contē
                     dendum. For if any man should cal
the putrefied vlcer, ye corrosiue vlcer, Gā
                     grena,
Erisipelas, the cancrous vlcer, the
holed or cornered vlcer, the vlcer with putrefaction
at the bone, the vlcer called Cacoethes,
the painfull vlcer, and all others
of that sorte: If any man (I saye) should
prescribe these as differēces of vlcers, we
ought not to contende with him, so that
he minister right curation to euery of thē.
And they are called differences of vlcers
taken of that wherto they are ioyned, that
is to saye, the differences of the thinges
conteined with the disease: the differences
of the thinges conteined with the accidentes:
and the differēces of the things
conteyned with the causes and others (if
any be) of like sort.
            
            
               
               Of the causes of Vlcers.
               THe latter sect of Chirurgians haue instituted
two generall causes throughout
all vlcers,Causae vlceris. that is to saye, the Antecedent
causes named of the Grekes
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
And the coniunctiue causes also called

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The antecedent causes are
these, viz. cutting, breaking, tearing, and
suche like solution of continuitie, whiche
cannot euen by & by stirre vp Sanies, Pus,
or Sordicies, which are iudged necessarily
to associate the vlcers, although it may be
done in time, & that in remouing the antecedent
and corporall causes. Therefore
the antecedent causes of vlcers is Cacochima,
whiche is euill iuyce, and that is, when
the humors haue onely defaulte in
qualitie and not in quantitie: and also to
muche aboundance of those peruerse humors
being in the bodye, may at lengthe
corrupt and putrifie the said partes of the
same body. Furthermore, the wickednes
of the said iuyce, is either engendred by a
peruerse kynde of diet, or throughe the
whole body, or els some particuler member:
as through default, which may be either
in the liuer or splene, as Galene in diuers

places hath sufficiently testified.
               The coniunctiue causes is said to be that
intemperature,Causae cō
                     iunct. whiche is called the malice
of complexion in the wounded partes
through the antecedēt causes, or through
the woundes and hurtes them selues, or
other tumors against nature, but especially
through malignaunt vlcers, either
broken, opened or stirred. For euē the corroding
vlcer is engendred Ex herpete &
miliari, called of the Grekes Cenchrias, &
also of Esthïomeno, whiche is an eating
vlcer proceding of choller more grosse &
thicke, so maye it also happen of the carbuncle,
chiefly if it be venemous, whiche
maketh an escharous vlcer, ful of bankes,
filthy, and full of depe hollowes.Tres modi aegrè sana biliu
                        •
                      vlc. Wherefore
these three are accompted vlcers rebellious
& hard to be cured. First because
of intemperature, which commeth to the
subiect fleshe. Secondly through defaulte
of the bloud thereto resorting. And thirdly
through copie and quantitie of the matter
flowing,Gal. lib. 4. meth. medendi. as Galene credibly hath vs
enfourmed. He also affirmeth that the same
diuision may be made otherwyse, that
is of curable, and also rebellious vlcers,

the one for intemperature of the vlcerated
fleshe, and the other in respecte of the
humor flowing, and the same intemperature
also may be deuided twoo manner of
wayes, viz. when the fleshe is subiecte to
the onely qualitie of nature aboue measure,
or otherwyse when there is present
some accesse or certaine tumor. Now also
that flowing may be deuided into twoo
partes, that is as well in the qualitie as
also in the quātitie of the humor flowing.
               There shalbe therefore foure kyndes
of vlcers,Quatuo

                      gen. vlc. aegrè sana bilium. contumelious or hard to be cured:
that is to witte, the onely intemperature
of the subiect fleshe, whiche wee call
Discrasia, intēperature with an accessiue
tumor, the humor flowing, or vitious, or
much, for the humor which floweth abundantly
into the greuous part of the vlcer,
yea although it be not vitious, yet (for because
it engendreth therein excrementes)
it hindreth the healing with long detraction
of tyme. Galen seemeth also to make
and adde hereto a fift kinde in his Cōmē

which beginneth thus. Vlc. quaecun

corrupted bone in the vlcered place. For
when the fleshe which couereth the bone
hauing applied (according to art) exiccatiue
medicines) receiueth cicatrice: by and
by it semeth perfectly restored and amended,
but shortly after some matter thither
resorting from the corrupt bone, reduceth
in the healed part a present inflāmation, so
that after, there followeth not onely generation
of matter, but also erosion of the
aforesayd cicatrice & exulceration of flesh.Gal. lib. 4. Therapēt. meth.
And as we may plainly gather by Galen,
among the aforesaide affectes and dispositions,
al others to be vnited and knit, and
that many and diuers differences of vlcers
doe spring of those aboue mencioned.
Furthermore, there must be a methode of
healing shewed and declared, not of al together,
but euery one by him selfe, which
shall followe after, beginning onely with
the cure of simple thinges, that therby the
waye and meane to heale the compounde
affectes may the more easely be attained.
               Now, seing that as we entreat throughly
of vlcers, these wordes Sanies, Pus, virus,
Ichor, Sordes, and such like, are much
in vse, I think it not much forth of ye way,

if in this place we shew what those words
doe signifie among the Chyrurgians, and
that in fewe wordes, how they agree and
disagre. Sanies.
                  Sanies quid.
                  i. ichor, is properly yt thin
humor, which the Grekes cal
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , suche
as is in a wounde, neither newe nor olde,
but betwene both, and some kinde of this
Ichor is interpreted Sanies sanguinis, the
matter of bloud. And of Sanies
                  Sanei spec. duae celso. saith Celsus,
be twoo kindes, the one named
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
and the other
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , being thin
and halfe white, proceading of an euill vlcer,
and chiefly where as a sine we being
hurt, inflāmation is gathered. Meliceria
is more grosse, glewie, and like to white
honie, proceding also of euil vlcers, wher
the sinewes about the ioyntes be hurt, in
which places it greatly floweth.
               But nowe amongest the newe and later
Physitiōs and Chyrurgiās, who not
obseruing the true proprietie of voice, or
agreeing vpon the nature of the thing, do
wrongfullye vsurpe the name of Pus, in
steede of Sanies,
                  Sanies vul go pro pure male vsurpatur. sometime they make Sanies
a kinde of Sordes, Virus, Virulentū,
and Purulentam colluuiem, called of the
Grekes
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and of the Latines Pus. For

the name of Sanies being truely defined,
signifieth all humiditie altered aboue nature.
Wherefore if the humor be thinne
whiche proceedeth from the vlcer, it is called
Virus
                  Virus. or virulentia. If it be thicker,
Sordes.
                  Sordes. And if it be in a meane betwixte
both, it hath to name by proper appellatiō
                  Sanies.
                  Sanies. And it is saide to be found aboundantly
in vlcers, and but little in deepe
woundes. Sanies therefore is properlye
among the vulgar Phisitions and Chirurgians,
the same that Pus is among ye
Latines, and
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  among the Grecians.
Celsus calleth it the Genus, hauing vnder
it twoo kindes conteined called of the
Grekes
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  and
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the whiche
ichor of the Latine interpretors is called
and turned to Sanies and Meliceria called
Pus,
                  Puris generatio. hauing the beginning of contused
flesh or bloud. But in the generatiō therof,
there is a doubtfull or halfe euil transmutation
or alteration.Gal. lib. 5. Simpli. For as Galene
saith, there is in the bodies of liuing creatures
three alterations. One plaine and
according to nature, yt is when the meate
is digested in the bellie, bowelles, or vesselles,
wherein the iuyces are engendred,

and from whence euery parte receiueth
nourishmēt.Tres alterationes. An other plainly against nature.
viz. in putrefying all thinges, & this
(after a certaine manner) is contrarie to
it selfe. The thirde is mixt or in a meane
doing, partly according to nature, & partly
contrarie to nature.
               Therefore the transmutation or alteration,
whiche doth engender Pus, hath
the middest place amōg the best transmutation,
which is the nourishement of the
partes of liuing thinges, and that whiche
is simply the worste, whiche is made stinking
with putrefaction. For neither of
onely heat against nature, neither of heat
obtained according to nature is suppuration
or Pus engendred. But the heate of
the inflāmation is (after a certaine manner)
mixte of them both, whiche whilest it
gathereth to suppuration, moueth great
paine, and by the heat aboue nature of the
inflamed part, feuers oftentimes are raised,
and that by extreeme heating yt harte.
And these twoo doe chaunce (as it were of
a certaine boyling or burning of ye bloud,
which being throughly exusted or burnt,
the remnaunt of it is made Pus, as by the

altering of wood into ashes by burning,
as Galene hath left testified in his Commentarie
vppon Hippocrates, thus beginning.
Dum pus conficit. &c. By this
nowe it is manifestly proued what pus is,
howe it is engendred, and what is the efficient
cause and matter thereof. Nowe we
will shewe in fewe woordes what Virus,
Virulentia, and Sordes are amongest the
Chirurgians. Virus
                  Virus. or Virulentia, is a
subtile superfluitie begotten of abundāce
of watrie humors, which (saieth Guydo)
is of twoo sortes, hote and colde, whealike
or ruddie. But Sordes
                  Sordes. is a certaine
superfluitie more thicke, engendred of humors
hauing a thicker substaunce, which
truly is of three sortes, for some is thicke,
vnequall, heaped, and white, & some black
and like dregges mixt with ashes.
               Furthermore, that which they cal Virus,
Galene calleth it in Greke
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in latine
Sanies.
                  Sanies seu virus quid. But to saye at one woorde Sanies
or Virus, is that thinne excrement in
vlcers which cōtinually moistneth them,
euen as Sordes thickneth thē, whiche procureth
the vlcer named Rhyparon, that
is Sordidum.
                  Gal lib. 3. m
                        ••
                     h. For euen as (Galen saith)

the excrementes whether they bee thicke
or thinne, doe followe euery mutation of
the qualitie of the nourishement. So is
there wont to be a double kinde of excrement,
and that chiefly in hollowe vlcers:
that is to saye a thinner, called in Latine
Sanies, in Greke
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and a thicker also
named Sordes. Of the thinne excrement,
the vlcer is made moiste, and of the grosser,
filchie, whereof it commeth, that the
sayde vlcer nedeth twoo sortes of medicines,
viz. to drie that which is moist, and
to mundifie the filthie, but these thinges
doe belonge to an other contemplation.
But Pus
                  Pus est me dium inter saniem & sordem. doth chose (as it were) a middle
substaunce betweene thicke and thinne, especially
if it be that which is good. For
that is best (saith Hippocrates) which is
white,Boni ac mali puris notae. light, equall, and without noisome
sauour. And that is euill (sayeth Celsus)
whiche is thinne, watrishe (especially if it
be so from the beginning) also if ye coloure
be like whay, pale, yellowe, or like dregs,
and besides that, if it smell euill. There
is an other kynde of Pus
                  Pus
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   faieth the same
Corn. Celsus, called in Greke
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
which is apparauntly founde in great vlcers

beginning to heale, which is thinne,
half white, and as it were vnctuouse, not
vnlike the white fattines of oile. That Sanies
is euill which is muche in quantitie,Malae saniei notae.
ouer thinne, yellow, pale, or black, glewy,
or of euill sauour, or if it corrode in the same
vlcer, or the skinne nere thereto, & is
litle better, if it be somwhat more grosse,
half red or whitishe. Therefore the better
that the excrementes aforesaid appeareth
in vlcers, the better hope is to be had in
their curatiō: euen as that wound is like
to be cured with expedition, whiche hathe
good and freshe bloude flowing from it,
wherefore the signes both good and euil,
in euery of these, must of the Chirurgian
be diligently wayed. So that he may either
reprehend, or pronounce what vlcers
be vncurable, which be easie to be cured,
and which be harde to be cured. Whiche
thing is of no small weight, and the Chirurgian
thereby may laudably be wondred
at and auoyde cauillouse slaunders.
And this saide, shall suffice as touchinge
Pus, Sanies, and Sordes. Nowe it resteth
that we speake of the signes of vlcers, and
likewyse of the iudgementes.
            
            
               
               The signes to knovve the differences
of vlcers taken of the definitions.
               EUerie vlcer hath his proper note or token,
whereby he is diseried and knowē
from an other, and they are taken of the
definitions of euery of them. Wherefore
I suppose it to be worthy the labour here
to recite by the waye, the short definitiōs
of the chiefe differences aboue mēcioned,
wherein doing, wee woulde not haue the
Reader to regarde so much the woordes
as the thing it selfe. For we had rather
vse the common definitiōs allowed long

The vlcer whiche by the malignitie and

iuyce, which eateth and gnaweth the

humors more ample daily, is named Corrosiuum,
or Arrodens.

thereof do so much encrease, that not only

All the Phisitions of Grece, (Galene also

it, affirming that it hath certaine

The vlcer named Putridum,

whence some vaporouse & euill smelling

Sorditiem, with outward heate, superfluous humiditie, and ofttimes a feuer,

               But the hote Ulcers decline to a rednes,Vlc. cal.
and are eased by cold Medicines, and
are discerned by feeling. Therfore, euery
one are knowen, partly by colour, partly
by touching,Li. 4. Therap. and partly (saith Galene) by
the sense of the pacient. Some saye they

feele a burning, others, a manifest cold in
the part, and doe take pleasure in hoate or
colde Medicines. &c. Drie and moiste Ulcers,
also haue their propre Signes, and
knowē chiefly by feeling. For feelīg doth

hardnes and softnes, sharpenes and lenitie

some defaulte worthy reproofe in the

is corrupted.

harde to be healed.Aliud.

seest about the compasse of the affected
place, the Heeres to fall away, or Scales
to arise, Iudge that Ulcer to be peruerse
and froward, for it signifieth euil humors,
and maligne iuyce to flowe to the vlcered
part, which doe vehemently erode. Therfore
suche maligne iuyce, doeth neither
cleane abolishe the rootes of the Heeres,
nor yet suffer the Ulcered place to receiue
Cicatrice or Curation. But when those

Heeres had fallen before, do spring anew
about ye Ulcer, it is a good tokē or signe.
               The Ulcer (sayth Hipocrates) whether
it come before the disease,Aliud. Lib. i. predictionum Vlcus ante morbū vel in ipso morbo enascens. or in the sickenes,
ought diligently to be looked vpon,
for if the sicke shall die, the Ulcer will be
drie, blacke, or very pale before death.
               Ulcers wherein (after long emission of
Sanies, and Virulentia) perfect and laudable
pus beginneth to appeare, is a good
signe, for it signifieth both strength of nature,
and obedience of the matter. What
are the signes of good Pus, is before spoken
of.
               Ulcers in ye outward muscles of ye back,
legges, or armes, are not without daunger.Aliud. Vlc. in quibus partibus periculosa.

or reache vnto them. In what Ulcers so

they be well mundified: euill and superfluous
Fleshe will in them encrease.
But contrarily, which soeuer be duely, &
as they ought to be mundified and made,
(as it were) drie before, the Fleshe in such
(sayth Hippocrates) can neuer encrease
superfluously, vnlesse contusion happen

wont to be the worste, and not to come to

businesse, they bring childrē to vtter ruine:
Therefore in such, the Chyrurgians counsell
ought to applye a Cauterie actuall,

Ulcer compassed. In the outward members,Artuum vlcera.
that is to say, in the handes, feet. &c.
Ulcers and Tumors against nature, as
Phlegmon and suche like, doe ofte happen,
and commonly in the Glandulouse
partes, especially in those bodies that bee
Plethoriques, that is, geuen to much repletion,
for these partes, for as muche as
they be rare, are easie and (as it were) readie
to receiue euery humor flowing. For
so it commeth to passe, that through an
Ulcer, either in the finger of the hand, or
Foote, the Kernels about the armeholes
or priuie partes, doe also swell or receiue
inflammatiō, for when the bloud floweth,
or other humours should haue recourse
to the outward partes, straight by their
losenes and raritie, part of the saide flowinges
are in them reteined,Colli & capit. vlc. sometime also
the glandulouse partes of the neck (either

by Ulcers of the head, or partes nighe to
them, or els in them selues) do swel. And
Galene calleth these glandulouse partes,
which in that order doe swell, Bubones.
                  Bubones.
               
               When medicines applied to Ulcers,Aliud. do
profite, or (at least) doe no hurt or discommoditie:Si auxilia profuerint aut nocue 
                        •
                     int.
it is a sure agrument, that such
medicines were rightly administred. But
if they cause any present hurt, or do make
the Ulcer more drie, hote, or colde, it is a
token that the things ministred are not fit
for that present griefe, for that thinges
more drie or more moiste (as the thing requireth)
should be applied.
               Also if (by the thinges applied) the Ulcer
become more softe by & by, vse things
more astringent.Si vlc. arro d

                     tur. Neuerthelesse, if the Ulcer
doe erode and become more depe, then
beware diligently, for that springeth of
sharpe and vicious iuyce together with
malignitie of the Ulcer, els through the
facultie of medicines applied, whiche doe
more then sufficiently mundifie:Nota. for suche
by arroding the vlcered part, do encrease
muche Sanies, and make the Ulcer verie
moist, whereby it happeneth that vnskilfull
Chyrurgians, are so ofte deceiued in

their purpose, for thinking the Ulcer to
be Cacoethes, that is, that ye matter therin
cōteined to procede of malignitie, or (as
they terme it) of virulent and superfluous
humiditie, and whyle they earnestly minister
thinges sharpelye to mundifie, and
thereby maketh not onely the Ulcer more
depe, and hollowe, but also more hote, &
sometyme maketh it Phlegmonodes.
Hereby the parties affected, doe feele erosion
and mordication. Furthermore, amongest
many thinges which hurt or hinder
Ulcers, sayth Guy do de Cauliaco, ye
South wynde is vnprofitable, and also a
moist aire ioyned with heat.Vētus merid
                        •
                     onalis officit vlceribus For they induce
putrefaction in Ulcers, euen as all
things that putrefie, procede of heat and
moisture. Hence cōmeth it (saith he) that
Ulcers of the Legges, are harder & difficulter
to be cured in ye South parts thē
in the North, but in wounds of the head,
it is contrarie. And euen as many tokens
and iudgementes in woundes, are cōmon
to Ulcers, so likewyse the iudgementes
of Ulcers, whereof we nowe speake, may
bee to woundes compared. Wherefor
                     •
                  
whatsoeuer is spoken before in the iudgementes

of woundes conuenient, or agreeing
to Ulcers, reuoke them in this place.
            
            
               Of the curing of Vlcers in generall.
               IN the curatiō of Ulcers,Duo spectanda in curatione vlcerum. there are two
thinges to bee considered and propounded
vnto vs, that is, the contemplation of
the Ulcer it selfe, by what meanes it is
an Ulcer, with consideration of the cause
of the Ulcer, of the Accidentes, and euery
disposition therein cōteined, as also what
parte here or there it occupieth. For euery
Ulcer (as we haue saide before) either is
alone and by him selfe (that is, hauing no
other affect, neither conuersaunt with it,
neither going afore, nor following it) or
els is ioyned with one or moe, of whiche
some haue not onely stirred vp the Ulcer
frō the beginning, but also do now make
it greater. Others be of yt sorte, without
the which it can not obtaine the reason of
the scope of curation. But euery Ulcer, in
that it is an Ulcer, hath some common indication
of the cure (euē as Galene saith)
the way of healing Ulcers,Vlceris sa natio mediocris siccatio est. is by a meane

drying: this indication also is common to
woundes, if (at least they be woūdes) that
is, receiued of some stripe. This onely is
their difference, this nedeth lesse: and the
other (through the great humiditie) requireth
greater desiccation: If the Ulcer
be ioyned with any other affect, curation
ought not to be applied to the Ulcer, but
first to cure the affect, & lastly the Ulcer.
For whether Phlegmon, Erisepelas, or ye
tumor called Oedema, or blackenes, or
Ecchimosis, do besiege the Ulcered part,
the cure must be gentle. But if there be
some strong intemperature (whiche is
wont to bringe weakenes to the affected
part) and be ioyned to the Ulcered fleshe,
then, that is first to be cured. And when
thou hast cured the intemperature, afterwarde
thou shalt easely heale the affecte.
So must we first helpe the tumors called
Varices, whiche are ofte aboue the Ulcered
place, and then to cure the Ulcer. But
none of these curations (saieth Galene) is
of the Ulcer it selfe, but of some other affect,
whiche either maketh the Ulcer or
nourisheth it.In tollendis dispositionibus cum vlcere cōplicat. duplex consilium esse. Gal. li. 4. Meth. med. Furthermore, Galene affirmeth
that in taking a way the dispositions

cōtained in Ulcers, there are two things
to be considered: that is to saye, either vtterly
to take awaye suche like affectes in
the body, or els to destroye that which is
therein vnprofitably conteined. But this
he meaneth to be done where affect is little
and playne, for where it is great, it can
not be brought to a Cicatrice before, till
the other affectes haue remedie.Partic. in curandis vlceribus scopi. Of suche
like Ulcers therfore as are ioyned with
other affectes or dispositions, there bee
foure particuler wayes of curation.
               
                  1 The first prescribeth a cōuenient diet
fit for the curation of suche Ulcers.
                  2 The seconde is to diuerte the matter
antecedent.
                  3 Thirdly, in correcting and remouing
the accidentes and dispositiōs ioyned with
the Ulcer.
                  4 Fourthly, those accidentes being corrected,
doth teache and instruct vs to cure
them after the maner of hollowe woūds.
               
               But we doe follow the first and second
intention, both by amending, emptying,
diuerting and preuenting that same flowing,
wherewith the bodie of the affected,
doth abounde, and flowe in the vlcered

part. Furthermore, the wayes whereby
we may aptlye amende and diuert the abundaunce
of humors, & take away their
corruption is thus. viz. by Phlebotomie,
Purgation, Approued diet, Cauterie potentiall,
Uomiting & others of that sort.
We preuent flowinges with hinding, washings,
epithmes, ointments Exbolo armeno,
and other restrictiues. When as
therefore the humour flowing in the Ulcered
places, is neither more, nor yet
much worse then cōuenient, sufficient repercussiues,
& binding aboue the Ulcered
place shall suffice, & whiche binding doth
shut the pores wherby the matter should
flowe into the Ulcer: it is meete therfore
that the medicines applied to suche Ulcers,
be more drie then they that serue for
the simple Ulcer. But if it happen that
this flowing can not be stayed or kept vnder,
the cause thē must be searched foorth,
and that must first be taken away, whiche
if it come by weakenes of the parte that
receiueth it, it must be strengthened with
proper curation of the vlcered place. But
if it come by abundaunce of bloud or euill
humors, either in the whole Bodies, or in

any of the partes, they are first to be cured
but the imbecillitie of the part, whereto
by reason thereof more of humors then is
conuenient doth resort, doth come altogether
of intemperature, notwithstanding,
not of euery intemperature. Whereupon
it commeth to passe, that the vlcered flesh
is ofttimes only temperate & not weake,
and ofttimes both vntēperate & weake,
for strong intēperature bringeth weakenes
to the affected part.
               The thirde and last intention, which is
in amending and taking awaye the accidentes
and dispositions, ioyned with the
Ulcer, is brought to passe by due consideration
of the qualities of the
humors and nature of the
affected part.

               IN curing these kyndes of Ulcers,De vlc. malig. quae Cacoethe vocantur. the
causes must first be diligently searched,
to witte whether it be Plethora, Cacochymia,
or Cachexia, els an vniuersall intemperature,
or of some inward part, as

the Liuer, Splene, Uentricle, Ulcered
part, swelling of the Ueines, hard edges,

take awaye the causes according to their
natures then by diet, Phlebotomie, and
purgation to suppresse the members intemperate,
whatsoeuer it be, and in what
part. As for intemperature, looke before
in the chapter of the Ulcer with intemperature.
And commonly in these kinde of
Ulcers, we haue prescribed to the pacient

after the vse of common purgation, but in
them whose humors and iuyce is profitable,
a diet is sufficient, but if the vlcer seeme
bathed in humors, it is tyme to restraine

Lipothimia.

profitable, chieflye if the Fistula be
in any part of the brest. If the Fistula bee
newe, it is cured with the aforesayde remedies,
but if it be old, & the orifice streit,
it must well be enlarged, either with Penicillo,

               Of the Vlcered Canker.
               THe methode of curing the Cankred
Ulcer,De cancro Vlcerato. by diet and purgation, shall be
the same, prescribed in the tumor Canker.
If it be in the outward part of the bodie,
whiche may be safely taken awaye with
the rootes, must bee cutte wholy, and the
grosse bloud of the veines nighe thereto

pressed out, afterwardes the lippes of the
Ulcer to be taken awaye, and finishe the
cure in some with medicines cauterizing,
in others to consume it with a cauterie,
or after incision & expression of the veines,
to applie the cauterie. And amōgest cauterizing
medicines, Arsnick in this case is
principall, or the cauterie aboue written,
but then vse defensatiues to auoyde inflā
                  mation.
Then take away the eskar, and
proceede as in other Ulcers. But if the
Canker be great, and haue deepe rootes,
or be neare some principall member, or
inwarde parte, or the party cannot suffer
excisiō, either through weakenes or feare,
or that by the cure thereof, hee should incurre
greater daunger, it is enough then
to hinder the Canker to encrease, by diet,
purgation of adusted or melancolike humors,
and that gently with drying medicines,
without mordication or biting. And
this potion is exceeding profitable to bee
vsed nine dayes before excision, taking euery
daye twoo ounces thereof, whiche
preuayleth also though the cure be desperate.

               The Fistula of the fundament.
               THe fistulous Ulcer of the foundament
whiche is onely in the fleshe, is cured
by the same meanes and methode, wherof
we haue spoken in the chapiter of the
Fistula,De ani fistula. the diet being thinne and good,
with other medicines and purgations,
chiefly by the vpper partes, if it seeme necessarie,
likewyse with Phlebotomie, and
enlarging the Ulcers orifice, and the callous
substaunce diminishing.
               But if it haue,Quādo intestinū penetrat. pearced the intrelles,
put the finger anointed with oile of Roses,
into the foundament, & also Phaceolus
that chaunceth in the fistula, is in like

maner with the finger to be drawē furth,
so that it may not erre, least perhappes by
cutting the callouse substaunce, thou cut
also the hemoroicall veines, yet incision
seemeth better in my iudgement, then detraction
of Callus done by ligature. After
incision applie Albumē oui cum puluere
restrictorio, and then a digestiue ex terebentina
& oleo.
               
               Notwithstanding, great heede is to
be taken, that Callus pearce not aboue
foure fingers in length into any intrell,

            VVhat meates are to be
vsed as touching diet
in Vlcered bodies.
            
               GALENE sayth, that in
the curing of Ulcers,Lib. de partibus artis medic. ca.1 Et lib. experiment. cap. vltimo
(whiche haue their beginning
of other matters
or humors) there
be thre principal wayes
viz. Diet, aide of medicines, and operatiō
of the hand.Apho. 1. & 1. de ratione victus in acut. morbis. And sithens diet is the moste
noble, and excellent instrument among
the rest (as Galene supposeth) I haue accompted
it worthy the labour, only in this
treatise or part, to set foorth the onely order
of diet, to bee vsed in curation of Ulcers:
but amongest those thinges wherof
our bodies doe chaunce necessarily to bee
altered, (as Galene saith) and wherein also
the whole way,Lib. 3. artis medicinalis. or consideration of diet
doth consist is (especially) the aire whiche
doeth enuiron and compasse vs about.
Whereto also Galene adding sayth, that
whiche doth compasse and enuiron vs,3. method. curat. ca. 8. is
that without the which, neither ye disease

can be taken away, nor the health be kept
and preserued,1. De tuē
                  da sanitate further he saith also, that
there is no small strength or force of preseruing
the healthe by chosing the good
aire, and for this cause it is meete, first to
shewe what aire the bodye corrupt with
Ulcers, doth require. It is worthy to be
noted howe the disease is driuen awaye by
the chaunging of the ayre to the sicke bodie,
and that is by chaunging to an other
kinde of temperature in the aire, whiche
the dissease (which is driuen awaye by his
contrarie) doth aptly require, as if the disease
be of nature colde, the ayre must bee
hoate: and somewhat more, that is to
witte, of a greater inequalitie of the temperature
of the ayre, to the propertie of ye
disease, whereby it may the more easelye
be driuen awaye (as for example.)
            If the disease be colde in twoo degrees &
moist in one,Maior inequalitas a
                     •
                  ris ad proprietat. 
                     •
                  nor. the ayre must be of greater
heate then of twoo degrees, and of more
drienes then one degree. But howe shall
we be able to know, or discerne exquisitely
this proportion or excesse in degrees, sithens
Galene hath saide, that the certaine
quātitie of the thing, can neither be written

with penne, nor pronounced with the
tongue. The Chirurgian must therefore
endeuour to finde it foorth by coniecture,
for it suffiseth to the driuing awaye of the
disease, if the propulsatiue cause of the disease
doe obtaine a certaine proportion of
a greater inequalitie then the disease or
fore. Therefore, it is good for them that
are vexed with vlcers, to inhabite y• hoate
ayre, bothe because the naughtie humors
are made ready thereby, to breath foorth
by the pores of the skinne, & also because
the sine we members, whiche suffer much
dammage by Ulcers, do take strength by
heate. As Hyppocrates and Galene affirmeth.Aphor. 5. tepr. & cō
                  ment. 18.
Yet let not the heate be vnmoderated,
or to muche inequalitie, least the putrefaction
be thereby burned, and the disease
made more sharpe and fearce, and also
least the bodie fall the more redely into
distillation, comming by dissoluing of the
strong heate, into the whiche distillation
that bodie doth chieflye decline, from the
whiche distillation also, inflammations
maye easelye growe, and heape together.
Let the aire therefore conuenient
to him, bee more drie, that the Ulcers superfluities

and moist excrementes, maye
the more easely be consumed, and let hym
therfore eschewe the cold and moist temperature
of the aire, since the disease doth
proceede of suche like vntemperature, as
by Galene playnely appeareth The affected
bodies therefore shall liue better in
places where Hilles and Moūtaines are,
(though not in the highest of them.)3. Artis medicin. But
worst of al,Gal. 5. metho-curatiuae. in lowe, fennie, or plain countries,
in whiche places moisture doeth abounde,
but in the other drienes. Auoyde
therefore suche places as be cloudie, mistie.
&c. by reason of pooles and marrishes
whiche be there at hande, for that ayre is
corrupt, and encreaseth superfluous moisture,
whereby the Ulcers are nourished
and mainteined, whereby they ofte purchase
payne in the head, and encrease distillations,
which fall to the lower parts,
whiche is most familiar to Ulcers. Therfore
where the profitable ayre can not naturally
be had, let it be prepared by arte
in the mansiō, or abiding place of the partie,
for if the place and aire be not onelye
disagreeing to him, but also the constitution
of the time, let him vse gentle perfuminges

with spices, because their head is
also commonly replete with euill and vitious
humors, as saith Hypocrates,
               5. Aphor. 18. and if
the affected bodie doe feele hurt by receiuing
the fumes of swete spices, then let it
suffice, that he beholde or haue them present
by him, for the breath or sauour of
them, is a safegarde to all colde diseases.
But when as in the wynter season,Galen. 5. Apho. cō
                  ment. 18. the
fier shalbe agreable to it, then burne therin
ye wood of Rosemarie, Iuniper, Laurell,
or of the wood called Terebinthus,
or of the Larche tree, or ye Pineaple tree.
Furthermore, let ye partie couer his head
moderatly with hoate thinges, for an extrinsicall
heat is hurtfull vnto him, both
of those thinges wherewith the head is
defended and couered, as also of the aire
whiche is about it, for superfluities doe
issue foorth from it, to the members belowe,
by a certain dissolutiō, by the which
Ulcers are not onely nourished, but also
stirred and exiccated. The bread whiche
doth litle nourishe, I suppose to be profitable
for Ulcered bodyes, and not their
meate to bee equall to their appetite, for
the concoctiue facultie being weakened

in them by to muche repletion, many superfluities
are engendred, greatlye hurtfull
vnto them, let their bread bee suche
as maketh the belly softe, whereby the inner
partes may be clensed, and deiection
made of the naughtie humors. Therefore
let the bread be muche brannie, the finest
meale boulted foorth, which is proued fittest
for suche,1. De poten. alimē
                  torū. cap. 2 as Galene witnesseth, further,
let not their bread be to muche leuened,
for the tartnes thereof is hurtfull to
the brayne, and to the sinewes, which suffer
muche damage and anoiaunce of the
Ulcers, and yet let not the bread be vtterly
without leauen, for Galene saith, in the
same place rehersed, that that bread which
is altogether without leauen, shall not be
meete or fitte for any bodie.
            
               Of the vvine vvhich Vlcered bodies
ought to frequent.
               OF this opinion is Galene,
                  L

                        ••
                     la. that all excesse
is to be eschewed especially, that
whiche bringeth damage, both to the bodie
and minde. Wherfore, since wine doth
engender to smal damage to Ulcered bodies:

I suppose it best, not onely to counsaile
them to drinke but one draught, but
vtterly to refrayne all sortes of wyne, for
wyne hurteth the bodie, in so muche that
it sendeth grosse vapours to the head,
whiche being afterwarde expelled by the
painfull trauaile of the brayne, doth ruinously
fall into the lower partes, & much
hinder and endamage the healing or curation
of the Ulcered. And also for because
the nature of the members is much
delighting in wyne, and therfore do draw
it couetously to them before it bee concocted,
whiche then wonderfully doeth encrease
superfluities in ye bodie, the whiche
superfluous aboundance, nature (not being
able to redresse or amende) expulseth
them to the outward members so plenteously,
that in shorte space they engender
Ulcers of one kynde or other. I therfore
vnfainedly doe suppose, that Hidromel ex
decoctione Hisopi, & Betonicae, should
be a meete and conuenient drinke for thē,
the operation whereof is hoate and drie,
diminishing cold, grosse, & moist humors,
and aptlye strengthening the power of
braine saith Galene, and whosoeuer readeth

                  Galene in his first booke De tuenda
sanitate,
                  Li. 8. Simplic. medicament. and in his booke Exhortationis
ad bonas artes, and in his thirde booke De
temperaturis, shall plainely see the hurte
that is receiued by drinking of wyne. But
in Ulcered bodies, where doubt is also of
dropsie, and in those, who (through vehement
appetite and breache of custome by
the Physitians counsell) doe waxe sicke
for the taste of wyne, to such (I saye) we
must be compelled to pardon them for the
drinking of a litle, or as neede requireth.
The wine that is whyte in colour, is least
hurtfull for them, the fuming force therof
being delayed, so saithe Galene,
                  Gal. lib. 1. de tuenda sanita. Et li. 5. de loc. affect. ca. 5. for suche
wyne doth not only litle send to the head,
but also maketh the stomach strong and
forcible, but strōg wyne or vndelaide, doth
the contrarie.
            
            
               Of the fleshe meates vvhich
they ought to eate.
               FLeshe meates whiche in continuaunce
of time, doe get to them the nature of
earthie foode, substaunce or nourishment,
are very euill for those that bee troubled

with Ulcers,Galen. 3. De potentijs alimentorum. because they engender a
grosser bloud then is conuenient, so saith
Galene, for that their nourishement is
rebellious and stubborne, & not strēgthening
the vertues in the body, as the fleshe
of Beefe, Stagges, Rammes, and olde
beastes that be gealte, neither is Swines
flesh altogether cōuenient for such meates
do grieue the stomack, engēdring a grosse
nourishement sayth Galene,
                  Gal. lib. 7. Meth. curat. cap. 6. and nothing
assistaunt to nature in digestion. Those
meates therefore are verie fitte which be
hoate and drie in temperature, for in the
firste beginning the causes of Ulcers, are
iudged to proceede of colde and moisture,
and if any sodaine heate chaunce thereto,
it is thought to be through putrefaction
lying aloft. As by Galene we are plainly
taught.Gal. in lib. de curatione per sanguin. missionem. Wherfore the Thrushe, Owsell,
wood Plouers, and al that gette their liuing
in drie places, are most of others cō
                  uenient.
Also domesticall birdes, as Capons,
Hennes, and houshold Doues, are
nothing vnmeete, but greatly alowable,
and together with these ye Fesaunt, Partriche,
Quailes, and such like, are much
agreeing. The meate of foure footed

beastes whiche is alloweable to Ulcered
bodies, are these and suche like. viz.
Yong Conies, yonge Hares, which with
their moiste nourishement doe cherishe &
susteine the naturall heate, encreasing also
the strengthe of the whole bodie, which
is a trewe meane to restore the healthe of
the body, wherefore by this it followeth
cōsequently,Vlceribus infest
                        •
                      aquatiles minime prosunt. that all waterfoules by their
moist temperature and hardnes of digestion,
are to bodies thus affected, moste
hurtful & vnprofitable. viz. Gese, Ducks,
&c. Neither is it doubtfull to any man,
that the fleshe of Lambes is hurtfull to
those, and that because they engender a
substaunce to moiste, for so wee be taught
by Galene.

               ¶Of Fishe.
               BEcause Fysshe of theyr owne propre
nature exceadeth in aboundaunce
of moisture,Gal. 6. vs. part. cap. 9 which (saith Galene) is rebellious
to Ulcers, they are to be eschewed,

both because they augmēt the cause of the
Ulcer, and also for that they bee harde of
digestion, moste chiefly (saith the same authour)
those which are full of excrements,Gal. 3. De fac. alimēt, cap. 24.
of the whiche sort are the fishe of Lakes,
Marrishes, Muddie pooles, and stinking
Pondes, for their meate is so excremētal,
and so slimy, that thereby filling all the
pores of the bodie, empaireth the strēgth
of the members, and greueth or depriueth
their functions, whereupon, payne, lothesomenes,
rottennes, and corruption of humors
are engendred. But those fishes,
whiche are engendred in Lande floodes,
and are nouryshed in harde stonie and
grauellie waters, especially in quicke
streames, are lesse hurtful, the meat therfore
of those fishes whiche swimme in the
pure and cleane sea, is very litle hurtfull
to them, chiefly being taken when the sea
is at a full water, and tossed with a quicke
wynde, as manifestly it is to be founde in
Galene.
                  3. De pot, aliment. cap. 24. For by so muche the fishe is the
worse, by howe muche it is lesse exercised
tossed, and troubled. Let them also beware
of pouldred fishes, as I saide euen
nowe of pouldred fleshe. And we prohibite

generally al kind of fish, by what meanes
soeuer they be taken or kept, for by their
slimines they corrupt the humors, being
very harde in passing, and difficult in digestion,
and the more slimie the worse.
            
            
               Of Egges.
               
                  GAlene sayeth,Galen. li. 3 De potent. aliment. cap. 21. that the Egges of creatures
doe engendre good and perfecte
bloud, as the Egges of Hennes. &c. For
by the reason of the equalitie of their tē
                  perature,
they are iudged conuenient and
agreable to all bodies, as well diseased
as sounde, for they doe not onely engender
good humors and commēdable iuyce, but
also are of light digestion, & easie passage,
greeuing very litle the naturall strength,
as is euidēt in Galene.
                  Lib. 3. De fac. alimēt. cap. 21. But let the egges
be newe layde, or els they be rebellious to
the nature of man, and be euill to digeste,
engendring sundrie accidentes and euill
dispositions. Let their Egges also be boiled
in water, for the rosted are harder of
nourishement. &c Furthermore, it shalbe
best only to eate the yolke of the Egge, because
the white is of colde and moiste temperature.

Let the Egges also boyled, be
rere, for they be of swift transiture, engē
                  dring
the best iuyce, and strēgthening the
faculties of the bodie. But as Galene
                  Gal. 3. De fac. alimēt. cap. 
                        •
                     1.
saith, the Egges whiche are fried, of all
other are moste pernitious, and harde of
digestion, wherfore all meates fried with
Egges, are vtterly to be eschewed of bodies
affected with Ulcers.
            
            
               Of Milke.
               BOth Milke, and what meate soeuer is
compounded or made of Milke, are very
rebellious to Ulcered bodies, for the

                     •
                  uming to the head, whereby grosse humors
are engēdred.5. Aph. 64. For Hypocrates saith
that Milke to those affected with paine,
causeth ache in the head, and is euill both
to feuers and paine in the bellie. Also Galene
                  Gal. comment. 60.
sayth, that Milke well boyled, doth
nourishe well, and engēdre good humors,

                     ••
                  t in affected persones doth touche the
head, it is daūgerous, enducing the dropsey
in Ulcered bodies, therefore all forces
of meates made with Milke, must bee of
suche persones eschewed.
            
            
               
               Of Cheese.
               TO al that be affected with Ulcers, we
forbydde the eating of Cheese, bothe
for the aboundant slimines, which is therby
engendred in humors, as also for that
it maketh them slowly to digest.Lib. 3. De fac. alimēt. cap. 16. 
                  Galene
being witnes, whereby saith he, the members
(by the passage of those slimie humors)
are altered,Lib. 2. artis medici. and maketh ofte solution
of continuitie, causing paine in suche
persones, and that so muche the more, by
howe muche the chese is more salte, and
older,Galen. 3. De potentijs alimen torū. ca. 16. for therby it is tarter, and therfore
harder to digest, and maketh worse nourishment.
And note that although Chese
be of a diminishing facultie of grosse humors
yet is it vnprofitable, for by y• naugh
tines of the iuyce & boyling heate, it bringeth
more inconuenience, then the attenuation
of grosse humors can profite.
Since therfore there is a common faulte
to all kindes of Cheese, let persones thus
affected, ab staine from it.
            
            
               Of Fruites.
               OF Fruites (saith Galene) which men
doe eate,Li

call Horarios, for because they spring in
the hower of the yeare, whiche hower of

middest whereof the starre (whereof the
Caniculer dayes bee named) appeareth.
Of the whiche some are called fruites of
the earth, of whiche sorte are Gourdes,
Pompions, Citrons, Mellons, Coucumers
                     •
                  
&c. Whiche because they are of a
moist nature, and endewed with large
humiditie, they doe not onely engender a
moiste nourishement, but a slender humiditie,
and that whiche is easely purged
foorth of the bodie. Galene saith also,Lib. 2. De pot. alimē
                     to. cap. 2. that
that fruite both cōtaine a naughtie iuyce,
encreasing the disease, and weakening the
members, & almost depriuing their functions,
wherefore to be taken as an vsuall
seruice in Ulcered bodies we must flatlye
deme. And those fruites whiche Galene
calleth arboreous,2. De pot. aliment. cap. 7. are those growing vppon
trees. viz. Figges, Peares, Apples,
Peaches, Mulberies, together with the
fruite whiche the Italians call Armelini,
being a fruite accompted amōg the Peaches,
and Cheries, Plummes, &c. Whose
substaunce is soft and moist, not onely engendring

the like nourishment, but also
by their wyndines doe attribute no small
hurte and paine to the affected bodies, and
therfore are altogether to be forbidden.
But if the bodie affected do feruently desier
and earnestly (as it were) long after
fruite, then may we permitte him to eate
Figges that be well ripened, as thinges
lesse hurtfull, lesse engendring euill humors
thē the Autumne fruites, although
they be not altogether voyde of faulte, for
so they be not (saieth Galene) Notwithstanding
as is aforesaid,2. De pot. aliment. cap. 8. they be lesse hurtfull
then al the rest, yet nowe and then, an
Apple roste
                     •
                   vnder embres may bee pardoned,
for the fier diminisheth the moiste
iuyce thereof, and abateth the wyndines.
Whereby otherwyse it commeth to passe
that the eaters of fruites, doe ofte suffer
paines & tormēts in the belly, viz. such as
Quinces, Orenges, Medlars, Sorbes,
Nuts & such like, which are not only slow
in passage, but also being grosse, & gluie,
doe engendre astringent iuyces, retaining
the naughtines of humors. Notwithstā
                  ding,
we accompt not sweete Almondes
vnprofitable, sithe in them is conteined no

binding force, for y• they doe make cleane
and extenuate, and therefore probably allowed
in Ulcered bodies.2. Fac. aliment. cap. 29. And Galene also
affirmeth that Almondes do purge the
bowels, wherby it cōmeth to passe that virious
humors (being propulsed to ye skin,
and forbidden to abide in the inner parts)
are driuen out by the pores of the skinne,
as it were by breathing, whereby paines
of the belly and other exterior inconueniences
are preuented: wherefore sweete
Almondes are a conuenient & fitte meate
for affected bodies.
               But Filberdes and Walnuttes, because
of their binding strengthe, and the
cause aforeshewed, are moste vnprofitable,
and verie vnholsome for Ulcered bodies.
            
            
               ¶Of herbes to be vsed in
brothes. &c.
               HErbes fitte for suche bodies, are those
whiche be hoate and drie. viz. Hysope,
Calamint, Watermint, Fenill, Sage,
Betonie. &c. And when herbes that doe
attenuate and make softe, bee with these

compounded, then doe they easely clense
and expuise al grosse and slymie humors,
and therfore must needes be graunted cō
                  modious
for suche persones, & the herbes
of contrarie temperature. viz. colde and
moist, are as muche hurtful, such as Lettuse,
Endiue, Mallowes, Spinache, and
suche like, whiche by their colde nature,
doe compact and heape together naughty
humors in thinner partes of the bodye,
hindring their passage or expulsion, for
whiche cause the depth of the bodie is not
purged, but the disease more augmented
and a great deale the more when the patient
through fonde and gredie desire, shal
haue eaten herbes colde and drie, with astringent
facultie, whiche to the pacients
are moste obnoxious, of whiche sorte bee
these. viz. Plantain, Sorrel, Nightshade
and of like sorte.
            
            
               ¶Of Onions, Garlike, Musheromes,
or Toade stooles. &c.
               ONions, Garlyke, Scalians, & Leekes,
for their sharpe and byting tartnes
together with the obscuritie of their

substaunce both more dāmage to the body
thē their force of extenuating can pleasure
agayne. Of the earth also proceadeth
funges, or Todestoles, whiche any waye
prepared, are to be eschewed, since they
are not onely of euill iuyce, but their nutriment
is colde and flegmatick, and to all
accidentes and dispositions (proceding of
Ulcers) moste hurtfull. Of that minde is
Galene, saying further, for as muche as
Toadestooles can not drie,2. De pot. aliment. cap. 60. li. de cibis boni & mali succi. it is a manifest
token that in them is euill contained. And
Auicen saith, that prefocation happeneth
to them which vse to eate Toadstoles.
            
            
               ¶Of Pulse.
               SInce there is no Pulse endewed with
good & perfect pleasure, but doe greatly
fill the bodye, with wynde, by whiche
meanes paines in the bodye, may arise to
Ulcered bodies, therefore vnneedefull:
I do not without cause accompt them vnprofitable
(Galene being author) of which
sorte be these. viz.1. De potent. alimē
                     torum. Beanes, Fitches, Rise,
and suche like, let vs streightly cōmaunde
the Ulcered patientes, clearely to eschew

these kinde of graines in what order soeuer
they be altred: but to an immoderate
appetite, the broth of red Rice, may indifferently
be permitted, for that doeth attenuate
and clense grosse and clammie humors
& open the obstructed wayes, which
meanes are much assistaūt to the healing
of Ulcers.
            
            
               ¶Of motion and reste.
               VNderstanding by Galene,
                  De tuēda sanitate. that reasonable
motion is not onely helthfull to
the bodie, but also maketh the sayde bodie
of a good fourme, and habite, and kepeth
it in healthfull plight. It shalbe moste expedient
that the person affected, do moderatly
frequent the motion and exercise of
his bodie. But yet (saith Galene) I would
not haue him to vse it when he is full, for
endamaging or hurting the head with
vapours, whiche by muche motion maye
arise from the meate newely taken, and
vndigested. Exercise is good before meat,
for thē it encreaseth the force and strēgthe
of the bodie (saith Galene,) and thereby
purgeth the pores of the bodie,6. De loc. affec. ca. 6. and expelleth

the excrementes. Galene therefore
affirmed it profitable,2. De sanitat. tutela. to vse exercises before
meate: yet it is conuenient also to vse
exercises sometime after meate, not alwaye,
but (as Galene sayeth) when the
meate is entred into the seconde digestiō,2. De tuē
                     da sanit.
and the time of eating is at hande againe.
But if either before or after that time, the
exercise be vsed, it either filleth the bodie
with rawe superfluities, or els hastneth
the comming of Melancolie. For (sayeth
Galene) if the exercise after meate bee not
gentle and easie,2. De tuē
                     da sanitate it hasteneth downe the
meate from the stomake before it be digested.
Wherfore the exercises before meat,
must be more hastie and quicke, to the end
that the superfluities whiche lurketh in
the hollowe places of the body, may more
easely be expulsed, nature being assisted by
exercise.
            
            
               ¶Of sleepe and vvatching.
               
                  GAlene saith, that sleepe and watching,
doth come on euery side,2. Aphor. cōment. 1. according to
the motions of vnconstaunt heate, slepe to
the inner partes, and watching to the outward.

The naturall heate beeing moued
forewarde, for the whiche cause, when as
in muche sleepe the naturall heate (being
called to the inner partes) a great quantitie
of vapours doeth rise vp to the head
(whereby fluxions doe distill to the members
belowe, I thinke it expediēt that the
Ulcered bodie refraine from much sleepe,
least superfluities multiplied by reason of
sleepe, should heape and gather to muche
to the members, which lie and reste. Day
sleepes must be altogether forbidden. For
in watching, the breathinges may be moued
from the harte to the outward parts,
they doe attenuate and dissolue the grosse
and clammie humors engendred in the
members (natural heate being adioyned)
For the whiche thing, it is expedient for ye
partie to vse watching for ye longer distāce
of time. And when daily sleepe would possesse
an accustomed order, let it be shaken
of and lost by litle and litle, according to
the precept of Galene.
               
            
            
               ¶Of Ioye or Mirthe.
               
                  GAlene saith,
                     
                        ••
                     De sim
                     
                        •••
                     , causis that mirth proceadeth by
motion of the minde to the outwarde

partes of the body. For the breath being
gathered at the hart at the going foorth,
doth yeelde a comfortable heate to all the
members, whereby all flegmatick superfluities
in them hidde, is scattered and put
foorth, therfore profitable to Ulcered bodies.
But by sadnes (by reason) cometh
the contrarie, for that reuoketh al the spirites
and heate vnto the heart, so that the
outward partes are vtterlye destitute of
heate, therefore greatly mouing and augmenting
the cause of Ulcers, wherefore
vse myrthe, and auoyde sadnes.
            
            
               Of repletion and Inanition.
               REpletion, whether it be of meate, or of
euill humors, filling the vessels of the
body, it is euill, and straightly to bee reproued
(as sayeth Galene). For when the
vessels be filled aboue meane or measure
with meates and drinkes,1. Aphor. coment. 3. the parties are
in ieopardie of burstnes, obstruction of naturall
heate. &c. I counsell therefore all
those that be infected with Ulcers, to flee
from vnmoderate filling of their bodies,
(according to ye causes rehearsed) for that

thereby all paynes, anguishe, and perturbations
with euill disposition, accompaning
the Ulcers, may be incited. Let the
patientes therefore vse a slender kinde of
diet, and yet not an vnmoderate kinde and
excessiue fourme, spare feeding, sithens
suche may easely engēder the falling sicknes,
whiche when the stomack shalbe inordinatly
emptied, hath rediest accesse, for so
saith Galene.
                  In lib. de ven
                        •
                     . sec. cōtra Erasi
                        •
                     trat. But a thinne diet (by moderate
vse obserued) resisteth ye same. Galene
therfore hath this sentence, a meane & moderate
diet vsually kept,Li. de attenuante vict. ratione. doth safely cure
yong folkes of the falling sicknes newely
begon, & doth metely assiste them, though
they be olde, and the disease inueterated.
            
            
               De Coitu.
               FOr as muche as generally all Ulcers
doe proceede of intemperature, with
colde and weakenes of natural heate, and
that nothing more augmenteth the mallice
of suche affectes, nor encreaseth their
continuaunce, then exercises decaying naturall
heate, & thuse of thinges that weaken,
coole and drie the bodie. And againe

since nature in such parties is sufficiently
busied in strengtheninge and sending due
nourishement to the affected partes, it
must needs bee great damage to the patient,
and hinderaunce of the curation, to
vse Coiture, which (as Galene affirmeth)
doth make the body more weake,Li. de san. tuenda. 3. slacke,
cold and drie, whiche sure is needeles in
Ulcered bodies, who are commōly giuen
to be of that intemperature. And Paulus
Aegineta,
                  Li. 1. art. med. ca. 7. saith that Coiture hurteth bodies
sound, that be of colde and drie complexion.
Wherefore to affected bodies,
which haue nothing in them naturall
that may be wanted,
we ought without pardō,
to prohibite the vse
of venerie.

the waye, to set foorth in order the naturall

diligence at oportunitie of tyme, hathe
