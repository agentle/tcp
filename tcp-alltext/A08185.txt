               RIght Honourable Lords,
though vnworthie and
vnknowne (as n

to be known to your
Lordships) I want that
good opinion begot by
foreknowledge, which,
like a pleasing glasse that
makes any thing that is seene through it seeme
better then it is, might set a faire glosse vpon
the forefront of this rude Poem; yet not doubting,
but that your Honours will vouchsafe to

looke vpon my imperfections herein, with
more affection out of passion for the deads sake,
whom here I honor, then iudgement out of
reason to discusse, how vnworthie I am to discourse
of such Honor. I presume to offer vp in
my Walthams Complaint this funerall Obsequie,

                  ine of your
Fauours, as the Sacrifice of my last dutie to that
most Noble, and to you most deare, dead Ladie;
of whom liuing, by her Sisters teares, my Muse
in her first Infancie of being knowne, finding
gratious acceptance, but depriu'd the fruition
thereof through ineuitable chaunce, and hoping
with her weake breath to reuiue those
sparks that my inforc't absence had rakt vp in
the ashes of obliuion, lately singing the Image
of her Honer, was (alas tha: I should say shee
was) too suddainly thunder-striken by that
vnlookt for Dart of Death, in top of all her
hopes. Wherefore both of that consecrated to
her Honor, then liuing, and of this, deuoted to

               Walthams complaint cannot be told in vaine.

            IN that sixt month, whose name at first begunne
            From great Augustus, good Octauius sonne,
            When in each fertile field the flowrie graine
            Shot vp on high, did bow their heads againe,
            As doing humble homage to the earth,
            From whence they tooke their being and their birth;
            And euery fruitfull tree did seeme to groane
            As burthened with the fruit that hung thereon,

            To strip their boughes, and ease them of their lode;
            Beside the bankes of Lees delightfull brooke,
            WhichWaltham Abbey. 
               Walthams ancient Towne doth ouerlooke.
            I walk'd, expecting in the dayes prime birth
            The ioy, with which the morning greets the earth:
            But shee, as not dispos'd to mirth, did lay
            Her azure robes with siluer fring'd away;
            And in their stead, whose weare the world doth glad
            Was in darke russet mantle meanly clad.
            
               A vale of mist her siluer brow did hide,
            The golden tramels of her haire were tide
            In fillet of blacke cloudes, and with

            Earth, as it had a part in sorrow bore,
            Vpon her backe a cloke of vapours wore,
            And, as if wanting eyes her griefe to shew,
            Her grasse in stead of tear

            By breathing vaporie sighes into the aire:
            Whose waters bubling o're the pible stone,

            The bankes on either side expresse by voyce
            An inward sorrow, made a murmuring noyse.
            All thinges that came beneath my sight did show
            As each with other would consort in wo

               e,
            Where rich and pore find bountifull intreate,
            Sad spectacle of sorrow I did see,
            The sight of which did much impassion mee.
            On the bare ground, sitting in open field,
            A faire, but forlorne, Lady I beheld,
            Without remorse, now rending from her head,
            Her yellow haire, like threds of gold dispred
            About her siluer necke, now beating sore
            Her breast, the lodge of gri
                  •
               fe, and euermore
            Fixing her eye so stedfast on the ground,
            As thence, from her owne teares, which did abound,
            As from a Christall glasse, helpe she would borrow,
            To see the face of her owne faces sorrow;
            Whose wofull gesture did my heart so wound,
            That I requested her to shew the ground
            Of this her griefe, and she as loath to speake,
            Yet in these wordes at last did silence breake.
            In vaine, my voyce, in vaine thou dost impart
            Weake words, for signes of my wo-wounded heart.
            
               In vaine my heart doe thy sad sighes arise
            From inward thoughts with teares to fill mine eyes:
            In vaine mine eyes your moist teares ouerflow;
            No griefe so great, that can expresse my woe.
            Weak words, sad sighes, moist teares, in vaine ye bee,
            Mine Honour dead I neuermore shall see.
            To heare her mourning and her sad complaint,
            I silent was awhile with griefes constraint;
            Till sorrowes selfe did vrge me aske her name,
            To which thus shee this sad reply did frame.

            What I haue beene; yet beare I but the name
            Of what I was; and yet in my distresse
            Such is my chance, (hard chāce you wel may ghesse)
