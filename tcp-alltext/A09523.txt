                  COlonell, Captaines, and Souldiers; Your generous dispositions, in the most louing and kinde acceptation of these few Lines, which

some ten Weekes since, I Dedicated to your noble Patronage concerning our Foster Mother LONDON, entituled London Sicke at Heart, or, A Caueat for Run-awayes, hath much encouraged me to spend some of my best bestowed houres, in another kinde and Garbe of writing, yet to purpose and according as these dayes and times require: And my desires are, that I may shrowde these my Labours vnder the Banner of your protection, against all opposition. Be you therefore pleased (my Noble Martiall Patrons) to vayle me vnder the covert of your neuer vanquisht Ensigne, and then no other Colours shall daunt me. I write no Fables, nor Imaginary Toyes, but lamentable Experience shall justifie my writ.
            
               London was neuer more Sicke at

Hart, then she hath beene lately many Moneths together, her Lamentations will be remarkable to the end of Posteritie. I treat now in part, of a Country Ague, or of an Ague in the Countrey: They which haue gusted of it, and escaped, may thanke God for their deliuerance; But many that fled from their Mother London, from the Visitation which the Almightie imposed vpon her, haue felt the anger of the highest omnipotent Power, & were returned Coacht, not with Life, but struck with the arrow of Death by that Pestilent Ague. I dare not say, that the same Aguish visitation, was or is the Plague or Pestilence: The Countrey timorous Gallants will then be frighted, & leaue their Mother Rus (like Rusticals) and Winter themselues vnder the Roofe

of our euer tender and louing Foster Mother London. Which if they should? I beseech you noble fellow Souldiers, to deigne them Courtesie, and kinde entertaynment; and let them know, that although they contemned and despised the very Name of one of vs, and would not vouchsafe so much as to looke vpon a Londoner: yet for Charities sake, doe you bid them Welcome. Wee will not lodge them in Barnes and Hovels at the Townes end, though they bring the Ague with them; but, on the best Beds our chiefest Innes can affoord. Pardon me (braue Souldiers) if I answer for you; for I know the nature of a true Souldier, is to be pitifull and to shew mercy, where imbesilitie and weaknesse resteth. Therefore (noble Souldiers) you that

are the trusty Guardians of our famous Citie, (vnder our Soueraigne, his Lieutenant, and the rest of her graue Senators) be pleased to lay downe your Armes, and make no opposition ag

                  Yours, euer to doe you seruice, vntill I rest for euer: Marshall PETOVVE.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            THE COVNTREY AGVE. OR, LONDON her Welcome home, to her tyer'd retired Children.
            
               I Haue beene (most deere and more intirely beloued Children) so much burthen'd, pressed down and ouerladen with Lamentations, complaints, Miseries and Calamities for your long absence, in your vnhappie and vnfortunate (yet no otherwise to bee lookt for) Iourney or wandring Pilgrimage, that I am almost dead with languishing. But I hope I speake it in the Autumne of my woes and heart-breaking sorrowes; (I pray to my Sauiour I doe.) It is the Autumne time of the yeare; yea, of

such a yeare: such a lamentable yeare, such a wonderfull yeare of Mortalitie by Plague and Pestilence, as in my time, for the time (to my remembrance) is without and beyond any President. Oh woe is mee therefore: But my hopes are, and my assiduate and daily prayers, still shall be to the Father of vs all, who onely can, and none else hath power, to disburthen me of that heauy dead-striking-mace of Plague and Pestilence, that hath euen bruised mee and mine in peeces. And therefore for your sakes (my endeared retired Children) notwithstanding my Almightie Fathers exceeding and great displeasure I will vndertake to plead to him for Mercy in your behalfe: But indeed I may rather say in the behalfe of my selfe: For had not the Lord beene angry with me for my intollerable sinnes, hee would not haue suffered my poore Children to runne away from me, and to leaue me as they did: For which cause I haue indeed a long time taken it to heart, considering with my selfe which was my best and surest course to take, to worke my peace with my God, that he might take pitie and compassion both vpon me and all mine.
            At length, the holy Spirit of that eternall Essence Omnipotent Iehoua, possessing my distracted memory with my Sauiours vnfallible promise, Come vnto mee all you that are heauy laden, and I will ease yee. Immediatly with teares of Ioy and Comfort, I besought him on my knees and obtained his exceeding Mercy: For immediatly after my Dread Soueraigne CHARLES (whom the King of Kings euer protect both from his Forreine and Domestick enemies)

Commanded a solemne Fast and Prayer to be made and kept throughout my whole Citie, and the remainder of my Diuines continually Preaching and Praying in my behalfe for the appeasing and mittigating of the great displeasure of my Almightie Father: which my said Father doth begin to take (and praised be his name) doth daily take more and more to hart, thinking that it is now time to hold his Angels Rod from further striking: Now the God of all mercy grant it may be so; and I hope my prayer is to purpose; For me thinkes (vnlesse I dreame) I perceiue my Children begin to retire, and to returne home againe to their Foster-mother London, which they would not doe; did not my blessed Sauiour lessen his weekly Number: Is it so? nay then I perceiue the old Prouerb holds (Home is Home, bee it neuer so homely) and the Prodigalls Storie is likewise fulfilled; For they poore Soules, hauing almost spent all, and finding no better entertainment in the Countrie, are forced to returne of meere necessitie.
            And are some of you returned, (my endeered Children:) and will all the rest of your Brethren follow you do you thinke? I am very fearefull, I shall want some of my number. But howeuer, I must be contented; and in the interim I speake to you with a louing Mothers tongue. Oh welcome, thrice welcome in very deed, you are louingly welcome, my thoughts perswaded me, that in regard the Almightie God did visit me with the heauy Rod of his Pestilent affliction; you had beene only fearefull of me,

and not of him; but surely it now appeareth; and I am very glad of it, that you haue made your peace with God my Father in the Country, and all of you repented of your Sinnes, in that you haue found such fauour at his hands, and that hee hath giuen you life this dangerous time of Infection, which (to say truth) if you had staid with me though in the chiefest of my Territories, I could not haue warranted; No maruell then you fled from mee. Nay, I am further surely perswaded, that you whom God hath blest with longer dayes then many thousands of your deceased brethren; are such as left your beneuolence behinde you, to and for the maintenance and keeping from staruing those poore Creatures that did suffer and beare the publike miserie of such a Contagious time as this hath beene without president: Or else with life you could neuer haue entred my Gates: for which I truly thanke you, and no doubt, but my gratitude shall double that with treble loane. But I pray giue mee leaue to question you a little farther? Doe you all cast your dayes Iourneys so, that you will not enter London streetes, nay scarce her Suburbes, before the blacke clowdes of the duskie Night eclips the light of Luna from my Mother Earth; for feare the small remainder of your poore afflicted Brethren should call you in question for your flight, and vpbrayd yee with the tytle of Run-awayes? No surely, not all; for some of you it seemes, made your appearance daily at Noone-Exchange without Dread or Feare. God be thanked the East-India Ships are come; and some

from the Straights safely ariued? If it please my heauenly Father to continue as he hath begun, to cease the Rod of his affliction and to sheathe his Sword: the Residue of my poore Children to whom he hath giuen life, no doubt but shall see happy dayes, to my comfort, their profit and benefit, and all to the praise and glory of my eternall Father, which the Lord of all Eternitie grant for our blessed Sauiours sake.
            I am now at a stand, whether I with modestie may further question you or no: But I hope you that haue spent so long time in the Countrie may affoord a little time of Conference with your weeping Mother.
            I pray giue my desire satisfaction, and tell mee whether any of my great ones, or men of note, as Iustices of Peace, Aldermen or their Deputies, Common Counsell men, Churchwardens, Sidemen, or any other of my Officers which should haue imployed their paines and care in the time of my Visitation; did they, or had they any desire of repayring home, when they heard that my Poore cryed out for reliefe, and they absent which should relieue them (a Letter was all could giue them this notice, which Tom Long the Carrier brought, and neuer deliuered it, for he durst not.) But I dare answer for them; that had they doubted of their entertainment in the Countrie; they would rather haue continued at their owne Mantions vnder my gouernment; then to be so slighted by base ignoble Drones, as they were. Which I leaue further to treate of: But they

left their Charitie behinde them, which was satisfaction, and gaue content to that clamour, and ceast the Rumour.
            But now good Children I will yet further examine you, did not your illiterated Peasants your Hobnayld Clownes, Raphe, Benedicke, Nick, Tom, Iack, Hodge, and such like vnder the Iustices tolleration euen almost at mine owne Gates? I am sure it was within the sound of my night Ninth houre warner? Did they not keepe you out, with Pitchforkes, Staues, Hookes, browne Bills, and such like rustick Weapons, and you demanded passage; answer was giuen: No, for you are Londoners, true, we are so, wee will not deny it, what then? You come not here; why saith one, you suffer Rogues to passe: so we may one replyes, before any Londoner. Can this be true that my poore Children should be thus misused, amongst my Neighbours, such as haue daily Commerce with me; If they bring me Food, I giue them Money, the Land-lord must be paid. But thou foolish simple Countriman; hee will not bee paid with Corne, Oxen, Hay, and such like good blessings which my eternall louing and mercifull Father bestowes vpon thee: For (saith the Land-Lord) I haue of goods great store, I need them not; but as the greedy Vsurer he comes, giue me my money; I cannot cloath my Wife and Children with Hey, &c. Well, if it be so then, that thou must of necessitie haue money, or be vndone, and thy Lease forfeited, and thou, thy Wife and Children cast foorth of dores; what resteth then to be done? Must thou not

of force come vnto mee thy charitable Neighbour London; and doe not I from time to time, nay, at all times helpe you in the midst of your extremitie; Is not my Exchequer continually open vnto you: I haue no Barrocadoes to keepe you forth; but my Gates all houres of the night are open for the meanest Hynde or Swaine that comes. I, nor none of mine examine what Countriman thou art: from whence thou camest? or whither thou wilt? but come and welcome. This is and euer hath beene my carriage to my Countrie people: And now in the time of my Visitation, did my poore fearefull Children, come amongst you into the Countrie for a little refuge or recreation, presuming vpon the like welcome there, as you found here, and did you giue them Iack Drumes entertainment. Oh vncharitable, inhumaine and ingratefull people: Indeed it argued no Christianitie in you. Put case my dearely beloued Children, should (as I cannot blame them if they doe) take this to hart; and should shut my Gates against you, and debarre entrance to such inhumaine Creatures: where would your Landlords haue their Rent then? Michaelmas you know is come: the halfe yeares Rent must be paid: the last day of payment is at hand; Therefore because I will make you blush at your owne folly (if my Almighty Father will illuminate your darkened eyes of Ignorance, that you may soe the same) and that my Children (which will be ruld by me) may shew loue for hatred: See our Charitie is such, that all my Gates are open to giue you all entertainment▪
               
I will not examine you, or shut my Gates against you for feare of your pestilent Feuer: No, I craue your pardon, it is but an Ague; But as the plaine Country-woman said, I cannot tell whether it bee but an Ague, wee and the Londoners both are visited within the Countrie; but I am sure after they are dead, they haue the Spots vpon them: But howeuer my honest Country-men, let vs in the name of our blessed Sauiour, ioyntly: entirely and hartily pray to the Lord for mercy, that our Plague and Pestilence, and the Countrie Ague (if you call it so) may at once and together cease with a full period. Our Visitation here, and their affliction there in the Countrie, that my poore Remainder, which at home haue endured the Front and heate of my Fathers pestilent Battell, may not bee shaken in the Reare with their pestiferous Ague; which I am very confident he will grant, vpon our harty prayers and sincere repentance.
            
               
               
                  LONDON her Chabitable reprehension of her ignorant Suburbians for clamoring against her retired Children.
               HOw comes it to passe my litle tender Iuvenals, in whom there is nothing but ignorance, imbesilitie and weaknesse, that a Coach no sooner presents it selfe with it full lading, or Horsemen mounted: their backes towards the Countrey, and they facing the Citie: but you openly mouth it, with Exclamations and horrible Showtings! Welcome home Run-awayes, many times ouer; not respecting on whom you cast this aspersion, taxing aswell those, that from my bosome in the Morning tooke their leaue to solace themselues few miles forth of the Citie, and returning at night: yet your Clamours were all one, one and the selfe same still; Run-awayes, Run-awayes, Welcome home Run-awayes!
               
               Oh let it bee so no more. If you see a Caroch with foure Horses, come lagging home full fraighted (as if they were tyred with trauell) your Imaginations may strengthen your opinions so farre: that they haue come a long journey, and that the fraight or heauy load thereof, are some of my retyred Children, you may kindly and courteously bid them and giue them a faire Welcome home: And why? Because of the miserie they haue endured

in the Countrey; pittie it were but they should haue better entertainment heere. I know they haue vndergone so many Affronts, endured so much Dis
                  
                     〈…〉
                  , and suffered miserie vpon miserie without president. Tom Tell-troth, hath Ballatized many of their miseries and bad vsage in the Countrey: you vnderstanding his plaine language, may rest your selues satisfied: and leaue the Censure of my great offenders, to those of more riper and mature Iudgements. And so I leaue you, praying you to leaue that Clamour and Exclamation.
               
                  London.
                  I haue almost tyred my selfe with demaunding of many of my Come-agen Children, whether Report table or no? but can receiue no satisfaction. Therefore my longing desire shall accommodate my will, to sollicite that neuer failing Eccho to reuerberate truely, answers to my Intergotories.
               
               
                  And thus I begin.

I haue beene wronged Eccho, haue I not, by those whom I most respected? Is it not so?

                     And why? because in my distresse, and when the Violl of my Fathers anger burst forth, and the blew blacke drops thereof sprinkled on the bodies of my selected Children, whom God hath singled forth to beare the publike miserie the great ones fled from me,

                     Why should they flye from her, who euer loued them, bred them, and brought them vp to maturitie; was it because I was toucht with Calamitie, with Plague and Pestilence? was it therefore: or how sweet Eccho tell me wherefore?

                     Thought they distrustfull Children to flie from the Iudgements of the All-seeing, and euery where being God by running from me?

                     Why then I am sorry for them; they had but little faith?

                     But my Omnipotent Father found them out?

                  Eccho I heare too much, I will trouble thee no farther, my hart is almost burst with sorrow. See my poore Children; you were ashamed to tell the truth. But had those rustique irrationall Beasts: (as I may rightly tearme them) either reason, humanitie, or faith in my Sauiour Iesus Christ? they would shame, and feare euer to enter my Gates, to looke me in the face; their base abuse to my distressed Children, was so insufferable and intollerable.

But what entertainment should they expect from those, that neuer had or knew good breeding or education.
               Many of you in the Countrie style your selues Countrie Gentlemen; Few or none of you, haue showne any gentle cariage or respect, to many of my Children, that might euery way equall the best of you, that haue offered them such base affronts, and begger-like barbarous vsage. Nay I can averre it for truth, and it cannot be denied, that one of your Gubernators, I style him so, because the vulgar should take no notice, whom or what hee was: (did not shame) conuersing at a Meeting himselfe with others his like Associats, and some of my Children, (which were faine to dissemble their dwellings, and change their habits, before they could gaine entertainement, concerning Gods visitation vpon my people in London) did not shame (as I said before) to say for truth, that the dryed Salt-fish which hee bought of a Fish-monger of London at Sturbridge Fayre was Twelue-moneth; this time of affliction, had the Tokens on it, his reason why? was for that he heard, that his Fishmonger of whom he bought it, was now dead of the Plague: Whereupon one of my Cittizens which was then present, made him this answer; Sir, said he, when I am at home in the Towne where I liue, I vse to goe to Market my selfe, and going to the Fish-Market to buy a fresh Cod, two or three; I make a speciall choice of those haue spots vpon them; for they are accompted the best and deerest Fish; and no doubt but yours were such

(said he) before they were salted; so that discourse ended; But would any Creature that euer feared God, dare speake such an incredible tale; my prayers shall be to God to forgiue them, they know not what they say.
               You Loobies or Lobbes in the Countrie, I would with you hereafter, when your seed is in the ground, to pray for the increase thereof, that therewith you may fill your Barnes, Stables, and Hogstyes; and not with my deere Children, who brought more Gold about them, then thy selfe and all thy Hogs flesh could be valued at. Woe worth thee for doing so, A Pudding of a yard long, was as deere as a Chaine of gold comparatiuely, with such vnchristianlike Turkes; But let my sister Rus and her rusticall illiterated Hounds and Hyndes take notice, that (were not my Charitie such) as to giue way to their imbecillitie, and to lament for it, the many Soules that groned vnder their Intollerable sufferance and burthens in the Countrie, would call for vengeance: But I haue perswaded with them, and doe finde that (Quisquis sorte con
                        •
                     entus) euery one is contented with his suffering.
               I doubt it not (Courteous Readers) but some of you, know the Worshipfull Towne of Vtoxeter in Staffordshire I will tell you a tale, done at some time or other: There was a Waggoner did dwell and belong to the same Towne (it matters not for his name) who indeed when he had sufferance to come into the Towne, did dwell vpon his owne land And I am forced now vpon speciall occasion, to

describe the barbarous vsage of the ignorant Inhabitants of the same Towne towards him, (because it was in the time of Gods like Visitation as at this instant) His custome then was to furnish some Londoners (who remained in the Citie the time of the Infection) with Butter and Cheese, which he continued all the time of the same Visitation, (being a very honest and sufficient man) which the Townesmen of Vtoxeter, taking to hart: debarred him entrance into the Towne, at his returne from London, insomuch, that he was forced to lye forth of the Towne in a Common where he did continue at euery returne from London from the beginning of the Pestilence, till it pleased God to mittigate and appease his wrath as he doth now (his Name be glorified therefore.) Imediately then (as they might doe now) the discreet Gouernours of the same Towne taking it more to hart, dissembled themselues together, and being armed Capapee, with extraordinary Weapon, sallied forth of the Towne, Vi & Armis to kill the Wagoners Horses, and with a Ch
                     •
                  rlingdish of Coales, to fire and burne his Wagon: which they had done, had not a friend of the Wagoners entered into fiue hundred pound bonds, (stay there) into an Obligation of fiue Markes, with condition, either Endorsed or Subscribed, that the said Waggoner should not come within three miles of the Towne, after his then next returne from London; vntill he had be
                     ••
                  e ayred a full Moneth in the Countrie. I
                     •
                   this exceed not the Wise men of Goatham; Iudge you.
               
                  I must straine a little more; It is not vnknowne to the Chiefe onely, but to the Inferiours of my afflicted Citie, that the doting and fearefull Parents in the Countrey, (dreading Gods Iudgements should fall vpon their Children in my visited Citie, and his punishment strike them with the same visitation of Plague and Pestilence;) could not forbeare, but instantly (I may say innocently) assoone as they had notice, that the hand of mine Almightie Father, began to touch my poore Inhabitants, but euery or most of their Fathers or Mothers in the Countrey, whose Sonnes and Daughters were oblieged as Prentices to any of my Children in London; but Letter vpon letter came with Contents, beseeching and humbly intreating their Childrens Masters to giue them leaue to spend their time with them in the Countrey, vntill it should please God to cease his Visitation in London; whereunto my Children condiscended, but now what ensues thereupon? This; The Landlords or Creditors of some of those Parents cannot now (as I am enformed) demaund or require Rent or Debts; but they shame not to offer this affront? That they haue beene and still are so charged with their Children the Apprentices of London, that the remainder of their estate is not able to make satisfaction. Woe is mee that this imputation should bee layd vpon my Childrens Children for being their Seruants, they tooke them for their owne Children as they are bound by my Custome. Therefore sister Rus if thou chide not thy Children for their Ignorance, and returne home in safetie my

Childrens children, I shall not only be very angry, but my Sister-Cities throughout the Vniuerse will condemne thee. Salue it good Sister for your Reputation.
               One thing more I would entreate at your hands, that you would summon your great Commanders, for Charities sake; there may be order taken, to vnstake the remarkable places of my Children, whom God took to his mercy in the High-wayes and other places. Oh shew your selues charitable: though you would not affoord them Christian buriall. Let there no base stakie wooden memoriall be left to view, as if they had Misdone, Hanged or Drowned themselues, For Christianitie grant it; and withall cleere all the Hedges and Trees of those lamentable obiects which hang vpon them, that are a thousand times more mouing Corasiues, then the Executioners Wardrop at the basest Brokers stall. Now let you and I be friends; For my Children which are left, doe promise me faithfully, neuer to trouble you againe in that nature: They will stay with mee in my extremitie; and eate a Capon, drinke a cup of Claret, an other of Sacke; and feed in that grosse fashion; rather then on your daintie Puddings and Hogs flesh. I haue done, and I beseech my Eternall Father, the only Omnipotent God, to make an end to, of his greiuous Visitation, by his dangerous and fearefull Ague with you and yours; and his more fearefull scourge of Plague and Pestilence with mee and mine, and that for his dearely beloued Sons sake Christ Iesus his only Sauiour and Redeemer. Amen.

            A true Relation of the Funerall of Captaine RICHARD ROBINS, performed the 24. of September 1625. in Armes.
            EVEN then when fell meagre Death by the sacred Decree of Heauen began to shorten his Weekly slaughter, and then, euen then, when the vulgar Rabble of the Rustiques in the Countrie, mouthed it with a most vnchristianlike, and most vncharitable rumour (viz.) That there was not people enough in London left aliue to bury their Dead) Then, euen then I say, did the great Commander of all power, call to his Mercy from amongst vs, Captaine Richard Robins, one of the Twenty Commanders and Captaines (vnder the renowned Colonells) of the Sixe thousand trayned Citizens, of the euer famous, though now distressed City of London, who dyed of an Ague at Hackney in Middlesex, and was brought from thence to London, and Buried in his Parish-Church called St. Magaret vpon Fish street hill. Some few dayes after (as it is customarie amongst them) the Gentlemen of the Artillery Garden, that were then in Towne, considering the weaknesse of their Number present, and yet might doe no lesse, then giue the deceased Captaine his right and Merit; treated with the then right

Honourable Iohn Gore Lord Maior of this said City; that he would be pleased to grant a publique Funerall in Armes. And for that most of the Gentlemen were at that time in the Countrie, and therefore that the rest may strengthen themselues with their Friends that were also Citizens and Souldiers of the Trayned Bands in London; to make a compleat Company to make the Countrie wonder; whereunto it pleased his Honour to condiscend vpon Saturday, being the 24. day of September last 1625. was the Funerall, when all the Gentlemen and Fellow Souldiers met at the Artillery Garden, about two of the clocke in the afternoone, where they were ranckt by the Officers there (Souldier-like) according to the number, three and foure a brest, all the Musketieres both of the Prime and Reere deuision of Musketieres, three in Ranke; and the Pikes Foure a brest in the body. Captaine Von was Leader that day, Associated with Captaine Humphrey Smith. So Marcht they forth the Garden, to Leaden Hall, where the Herse attended, with an Epitaphe thereon diuulging to the world, the worth of that worthy Captaine, the Worshipfull Company of Ironmungers, of whom he was a member; The Masters also of St. Thomas Hospitall, of whom in his life time he was likewise one, attended with many more of his Friends. The number of Souldiers that were compleatly Armed, both Pikes and Muskettiers were Two hundred fortie foure, besides two Captaines, the Marsall, the Lieutenant, the Alferus or Ensigne, Foure Serieants, foure Drummes, two Fifes, the

Armourer, the Gun-maker and their Seruants; and Sixe Gentlemen who carried the Trophies of his Armes before the Hearse. The beholders then present, were at least Ten thousand people, who were eye-witnesses, that what is here related is true. The exact and Souldier-like performance and managing of the businesse, I referre to the iudgement of the discreet and wise Spectators then present. Only I will intreate you (judicious Reader) to take notice, that after he was Souldier-like Enterred, hee had three seuerall Vollies of Shot giuen. Which being finished, the Drums beate a Troop vntill the Souldiers came forth of the Church-yard (where the Vollies were giuen) into the street vpon Fishstreet-hill: where falling into Rankes as before, the Captaine commandeth a March to be beaten, and so Marched thorow Gracious-street, Cornehill, the Poultry, and Cheapside, that the Market people might report through the Countrie, that their rumour was false. And so to the Lord Major his house, who presented himselfe at the gate, and very Honourably and freely caused both Flaggons of Sacke and Claret to bee brought forth, for all such as pleased to drinke thereof; and there likewise were two Vollies giuen; for which his Lordship gaue the Gentlemen many thankes, assuring them, that they had done great honour to the Citie, and greater comfort to the Kingdome. Then tooke they a faire Farwell, and Trooped through Cheapside, and so to the Artillery Garden; whereupon lodging of the Cullours, they concluded with their last volly, and so I leaue them, but not you, for I entreate you to reade that which you haue not yet read.

               That now wee lose him, wee his Death deplore,
               Hee's dead, yet liues, wee hope for euermore.
               Dead though he be, and from vs quite bereauen,
               Though dead to vs, yet doth he liue in Heauen.

            NOble Souldiers, and my valiant Children, you haue lodg'd your Colours, and finished your last Volly. Giue me leaue I pray you, to adde one Volly more, according to my nature and condition, and so Ile conclude. My shot shall not be Bullets of Amunition, but words of Admonition, which I will mildely & modestly dart amongst you. You my deere Children, which haue beene so barbarously vsed in the Countrie amongst those inhumane People, such of you especially I speake to, who are Land-lords and Creditours to your inferiour Brethren. Let me beg and intreat you (although you haue endured much discontent and sorrow in the Countrie) not to reuenge it vpon your poore Brethren in London, who haue vndergone with me, more griefe, more want, more sighes, more teares, more Grones, and more Miserie then my Tongue or Pen can expresse. Oh be mercifull my good Children one to another, as you would haue my Sauior to take mercy vpon you. You that are Land-lords be not ouer-hasty with your poore Tenants, for your Rents: Nor you that are Creditors, oh be not harsh nor seuere to your weake and impouerished Debtors: But consider the lamentable misery they haue a long time endured: and the extraordinary expences they haue beene at, and no meanes to get a penny, which you in your discretions cannot choose but conceaue; and I hope will take so much to 
                  •
               art,

that for Charitie you will spare them, vntill such time as my disioynted Estate be settled againe; and my Citizens haue Commerse one with another as they haue had, and Trading as frequent as it hath beene, that thereby they may striue and endeuour to get, what they of necessitie haue spent: and by their honest Industry & labour in their Vocations, attaine to their former Maturity in their seuerall estates. Which they may doe, so your patience please to giue them time and libertie; which I beseech you grant, that all of you may haue full satisfaction and content. The Tenant content from the Land-lord by his great patience, the Debtor content from the Creditor by his much forbearance. And the Land-lords and Creditors from the Tenants and Debtors haue full satisfaction. Such a blessed time, and those happy dayes doth your poore Mother desire to see; which that both she and you, and all of vs may see, let vs all pray joyntly to his Diuine Maiestie, that only can grant our request.
            
               Grant then good God, what we require of thee,
               And wee shall praise thy Name eternally.
            
            Amen.
            FINIS.
