                  Sunday being the 22 of Iune laſt paſt, 1600.

                  are of bloudie battailes,
               and worthy warlike fight,
               To Flaunders bend your ears a while
               and you ſhall truely know,
               How valliantly our Noble friends,
               their foes did ouerthrow.
            
            
               The Archduke of Auſtria,
               
               that bloudy Spaniſh Lord:
               Like Iudas hath conuerted,
               his booke into a ſword.
               To plant by curſed Popery,
               in Flaunders now againe:
               to bring the Quéen of Englāds friends
               in ſeruitude to Spaine.
            
            
               But Noble Prince, Graue Maurice,
               
               his purpoſe to preuent:
               Hath entred famous Flaunders,
               to warlike battle bent:
               With fiftéene thouſand horſe and foote,
               prepared well to fight:
               At Phillipeena landed firſt,
               the twelfe of Iune by night.
            
            
               From thence a long to Oldenbirdge,
               they marched on a maine:
               And cut of all the beſt reliefe,
               quite from the hoaſt of Spaine.
               All the ſconces and the Fortes,
               that by the way they found,
               Belonging to the Spaniſh power,
               they raced to the ground.
            
            
               And ſo to Newport marched,
               with thundring lowde allarmes:
               And there beſiegde it brauely,
               by force of warlike armes.
               The Cannons plaide vp to the walles
               the muſkets ſhot amaine:
               As though that Mars himſelfe were come
               to fight or elſe be ſlaine.
            
            
               By this he heard the Archduke,
               was comming for to raiſe
               His ſiedge, with full ten thouſand,
               reſting neither night nor dayes.
               Whereat the States Generall,
               did chooſe a Regiment:
               Of nimble Scotch and hardy Dutch,
               their comming to preuent.
            
            
               To Count Erneſtus of Naſſaw
               committed them in charge:
               About foure miles from Newport,
               to fortifie a Bridge.
               Who failed much therein, becauſe
               the Duke had paſt the ſame:
               Before Erneſtus Regiments,
               all ſoftly thether came.
            
            
               The Scotch-men were all cut off,
               and put to ſlaughter quite:
               But yet the Dutchmen hapned,
               to ſaue themſelues by flight.
               The which imboldned ſo the foe
               that he went forward ſtill:
               Without all daunger of aſſault,
               or fearing any ill.
            
            
               Vpon the foure and twenty day,
               they planted on a plaine:
               Eight great Canons ſoundly chargde
               a battle to maintaine.
               Whereat the Princely Generall,
               the ſiedge did ſoone forſake:
               And marcht to méete the Archduke,
               the better ground to take.
            
            
               Sir Frances Véere directed him,
               his ſquadrons to diſpoſe:
               How beſt for his aduantage,
               ſhould ſet vpon his foes.
               Nine Noble Engliſh Gentlemen,
               the firſt encounter gaue:
               With as much honour and renowne,
               as any Prince might haue.
            
            
               But yet before this battell ſtrong,
               betwixt them were begun:
               they ſtroue at leaſt ful two houres long
               for weather, winde and ſunne.
               At laſt Duke Alberts warlike drums
               did thunder in the ſkies:
               whereat Prince Maurice ſtird himſelf
               and thus couragious cryes.
            
            
               For Flaunders, and for England,
               braue gallants muſt we fight:
               In his defence and quarrell,
               that is the God of might.
               To armes I ſay then gallant lads,
               let nothing vs diſmay:
               Againſt profeſſed foes we fight,
               and hope to win the day.
            
            
               Which wordes did ſo imbolden,
               them of the common ſort▪
               
               That euery one eſteemde,
               the battle for a ſport.
               Where though they ſaw an hundred ſlaine
               by one great Cannon ſhot:
               Yet none of them in feare thereof,
               from thence would mooue a foote.
            
            
               Full foure long houres continued,
               this blacke and dreadfull fight:
               That both ſides well maintained,
               with courage and great might.
               The Cannons made ſuch lanes of men
               that ſoldiours wetſhood ſtood:
               As they diſcharg'd their Muſket ſhot,
               in pooles of purple blood.
            
            
               The ſunne with ſmoke was darkned,
               the element likewiſe:
               That like a diſmall cole blacke night,
               appeared all the ſkies.
               Like mountaines dead men lay on heapes
               moſt gréeuous to beholde:
               By numbers great and infinite,
               paſt reaſon to be tolde.
            
            
               At laſt the fearfull enemy,
               from field began to flye:
               Whereat our Engliſh Captaines,
               ſaint George ſaint George did cry,
               The battle's won, the day is ours,
               take courage by this chance:
               And in the honour of this day,
               our Engliſh Croſſe aduance.
            
            
               Then foure miles they purſued,
               the Spaniards in their flight:
               ſtill ſlaughtering them by thouſands,
               and ſo returnde by night.
               To Newport backe with warlike ioy
               the ſiedge for to renew:
               And driue the Spaniards from the towne
               with balles of fiery hew.
            
            
               In this ſame dreadfull battle,
               the Spaniſh Duke had ſlaine:
               Aboue fiue thouſand at the leaſt,
               moſt heauy newes for Spaine.
               One thouſand more they priſoners took
               withall three Spaniſh Lords:
               Which were by force compeld to yéeld
               them priſoners to our ſwordes.
            
            
               The Duke himſelfe as chaunced,
               was hurt with Muſket ſhot:
               And in ſuch ſort as hardly he,
               aliue to Bruſſels got.
               His Cannons they were taken all,
               his Treaſure and his Plate:
               Which be good priſes, and eſtéemde,
               well of the Flemiſh ſtate.
            
            
               A hundred fiftye Enſignes,
               were taken on that day,
               All which may be ſufficient
               the Spaniards to diſmay.
               And neuer more haue ſo bould harts,
               in warre to lift their handes:
               Againſt our noble Engliſh friendes,
               now in the Netherlandes.
            
            
               Of Engliſh, Scots and Dutchmen,
               we had ſome ſtore yſlaine,
               But few they were in number
               to them that fought for Spaine
               Few choſen captaines we had hurt,
               but braue Lord Graye in fight
               And bould ſir Frances of Deueere,
               that moſt renowned knight.
            
            
               Who had bene ſlaine or ſmoothered
               amongſt the mained men,
               Had not ſir Robert Drewrie
               moſt brauely playd the man,
               Who from the thickeſt of the fight
               bore him from thence away
               A nobler deed then this was not
               perform'd of all that daye.
            
            
               Thus haue you hearde the ſeruice
               of theſe our Engliſh friendes,
               That ſtil with loſſe of life and limmes
               the Flemiſh ſtate defends.
               God baniſh thence idolatrie,
               that Engliſh men may ſay:
               That ſtil we haue in ſpight of Spaine
               ſome frendes beyond the ſea.
