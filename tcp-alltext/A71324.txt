            Imprinted at London for Robert Dexter, at the ſigne of the Braſen Serpent in Paules Church yard. 1599.
         
         
            
            
            The Authors charge to his Satyres.
            
            
               YE luck-leſſe Rymes, whom not vnkindly ſpight
               Begot long ſince of Trueth and holy Rage,
               Lye heere in wombe of Silence and ſtill Night
               Vntill the broyles of next vnquiet age:
               That which is others graue ſhalbe your wombe,
               And that which beares you, your eternall Toombe.
            
            
               Ceaſe ere ye gin, and ere ye liue be dead,
               And dye and liue ere euer ye be borne,
               And be not bore, ere ye be buried,
               Then after liue, ſith you haue dy'd beforne,
               When I am dead and rotten in the duſt,
               Then gin to liue, and leaue when others luſt.
            
            
               For when I die, ſhall Enuie die with mee
               And lye deepe ſmothered with my Marble-ſtone,
               Which while I liue cannot be done to dye,
               
               Nor, if your life gin ere my life be done,
               Will hardly yeeld t'await my mourning hearſe.
               But for my dead corps change my liunig verſe.
            
            
               What ſhall the aſhes of my ſenſeleſſe vrne,
               Neede to regard the rauing world aboue.
               Sith afterwards I neuer can returne
               To feele the force of hatred or of loue?
               Oh if my ſoule could ſee their Poſt-hume spight
               Should it not ioy and triumph in the ſight?
            
            
               What euer eye ſhalt finde this hatefull ſcrole
               After the date of my deare Exequies,
               
               Ah pitty thou my playning Orphanes dole
               That faine would ſee the ſunne before it dies:
               It dy'de before, now let it liue againe,
               Then let it die, and bide ſome famous bane.
            
            
               Satis eſt potuiſſe videri.

               SAT. 1.
               Che baiar vuol, bai.
               
                  VVHO dares vpbraid theſe open rimes of mine
                  With blindfold Aquines, or darke Venuſine?
                  
                  Or rough-hew'ne Teretiſmes writ in th'antique vain
                  Like an old Satyre, and new Flaccian?
                  
                  Which who reads thriſe, & rubs his rugged brow,
                  And deepe intendeth euery doubtfull row,
                  Scoring the margent with his blazing ſtars
                  And hundreth crooked interlinears,
                  (Like to a Merchants debt-role new defac't
                  When ſome crack'd Manour croſt his book at laſt)
                  Should all in rage the Curſe-beat Page out-riue,
                  And in ech duſt-heape bury mee aliue
                  
                  Stamping like Bucephall, whoſe ſlackned raines,
                  And bloody fet-lockes fry with ſeuen mens braines;
                  More cruell than the crauon Satyres Ghoſt,
                  That bound dead bones vnto a burning poſt,
                  Or ſome more ſtrait-lac'd Iuror of the reſt,
                  Impannel'd of an Holy-Fax inqueſt;
                  Yet wel bethought ſtoops downe, and reads a new:
                  The beſt lieslow, and loathes the ſhallow view,
                  Quoth old Eudemon, when his gout-ſwolne fiſt
                  Gropes for his double Ducates in his chiſt:
                  Then buckle cloſe his careleſſe lyds once more,
                  To poſe the pore-blinde ſnake of Epidaore.
                  
                  That Lyncius may be match't with Gaulards ſight,
                  That ſees not Paris for the houſes height;
                  Or wilie Cyppus, that can winke and ſnort
                  Whiles his wife dallies on Maecenas ſkort;
                  Yet when hee hath my crabbed Pamphlet red
                  As often times as PHILLIP hath beene dead,
                  
                  Bids all the Furies haunt each peeuiſh line
                  That thus haue rackt their friendly readers eyne;
                  Worſe than the Logogryphes of later times,
                  Or Hundreth Riddles ſhak't to ſleeue-leſſe rimes;
                  Should I endure theſe curſes and diſpight
                  While no mans eare ſhould glow at what I write?
                  
                     Labeo is whip't, and laughs mee in the face:
                  Why? for I ſmite and hide the galled place.
                  Gird but the Cynicks Helmet on his head,
                  Careshee for Talus, or his flayle of lead?
                  Long as the craftie Cuttle lieth ſure
                  In the blacke Cloude of his thicke vomiture;
                  Who liſt complaine of wronged faith or fame
                  When hee may ſhift it to anothers name?
                  
                     Caluus can ſcratch his elbow, and can ſmile,
                  That thrift-leſſe Pontice bites his lip the while.
                  Yet I intended in that ſelfe deuiſe,
                  To checke the churle for his knowne couetiſe.
                  
                  Ech points his ſtraight fore-finger to his friend,
                  Like the blind Diall on the Belfrey end:
                  Who turnes it homeward to ſay, this is I,
                  As bolder Socrates in the Comedy?
                  But ſingle out, and ſay once plat and plaine
                  That coy Matrona is a Curtizan,
                  Or thou falſe Cryspus chokd'ſt thy wealthie gueſt
                  Whiles hee lay ſnoring at his midnight reſt,
                  And in thy dung-cart did'ſt the carkaſſe ſhrine
                  And deepe intombe it in Port-eſquiline.
                  
                  Proud Trebius liu's for all his princely gate
                  On third-hand ſuits, and ſcrapings of the plate.
                  
                     Titius knew not where to ſhroude his head
                  Vntill hee did a dying widow wed
                  Whiles ſhe lay doting on her deathes bed,
                  And now hath purchaſ'd lands with one nights paine
                  And on the morrow woes and weds againe.
                  Now ſee I fire-flakes ſparkle from his eyes
                  
                  Like a Comets tayle in th'angry skies,
                  His pouting cheeks puffe vp aboue his brow
                  Like a ſwolne Toad touch't with the Spyders blow;
                  His mouth ſhrinks ſideward like a ſcornefull Playſe
                  
                  To take his tired Eares ingratefull place.
                  His Eares hang lauing like a new-lug'd ſwine
                  To take ſome counſell of his grieued eyne.
                  Now laugh I loud, and breake my ſplene to ſee
                  This pleaſing paſtime of my poeſie,
                  Much better than a Paris-garden Beare,
                  Or prating puppet on a Theatere,
                  Or Mimoes whiſtling to his tabouret
                  Selling a laughter for a cold meales meate.
                  Go to then ye my ſacred Semones,
                  
                  And pleaſe me more, the more ye do diſpleaſe;
                  Care we for all thoſe bugs of ydle feare?
                  For Tigels grinning on the Theater,
                  Or ſcar-babe threatnings of the raſcal crue,
                  
                  Or wind-ſpent verdicts of each Ale-knights view?
                  What euer breſt doth freeze for ſuch falſe dread,
                  Beſhrow his baſe white liuer for his meede.
                  Fond were that pitie, and that feare were ſin,
                  To ſpare waſt leaues that ſo deſerued bin.
                  Thoſe toothleſſe Toyes that dropt out by miſ-hap,
                  Bee but as lightning to a thunder-clap:
                  Shall then that foule infamous Cyneds hide
                  Laugh at the purple wales of others ſide?
                  Not, if hee were as neere, as by report,
                  The ſtewes had wont to be to the Tenis-court,
                  Hee that while thouſands enuie at his bed,
                  Neighs after Bridals, and freſh-mayden heade;
                  While ſlauiſh Iuno dares not looke awry
                  To frowne at ſuch imperious riualrye,
                  Not tho ſhee ſees her wedding Iewels dreſt
                  To make new Bracelets for a ſtrumpets wreſt,
                  Or like ſome ſtrange diſguiſed Meſſaline,
                  
                  
                  Hires a nights lodging of his concubine;
                  Whether his twilight-torch of loue do call
                  To reuils of vncleanly Muſicall,
                  Or midnight plaies, or Tauerns of new wine,
                  Hy ye white Aprons to your Land-Lords ſigne;
                  When all, ſaue tooth-leſſe age or infancie,
                  Are ſummon'd to the Court of Venerie.
                  Who liſt excuſe? when chaiſter dames can hyre,
                  Some ſnout-faire ſtripling to their Apple-ſquire:
                  Whom ſtaked vp like to ſome ſtallion-ſteede
                  They keepe with Egs and Oyſters for the breede.
                  O Lucine! barren Caia hath an heire
                  After her huſband's dozen yeares deſpaire.
                  And now the bribed Mid-wife ſweares apace,
                  The baſtard babe doth beare his fathers face.
                  But hath not Lelia paſt hir virgine yeares?
                  For modeſt ſhame (God wot) or penall feares.
                  He tels a Merchant tidings of a priſe,
                  
                  That tels Cynedo of ſuch nouelties,
                  Worth little leſſe than landing of a Whale,
                  Or Gades ſpoyles, or a churles funerale:
                  Go bid the baines and point the bridall day,
                  His broking Baud hath got a noble prey,
                  A vacant tenement, an honeſt dowre
                  Can fit his pander for her paramoure,
                  That hee, baſe wretch, may clog his wit-old head
                  And giue him hanſell of his Hymen-bed.
                  Ho! all ye Females that would liue vnſhent
                  Fly from the reach of Cyneds regiment.
                  If Trent be drawne to dregs, and Low refuſe,
                  Hence ye hot lechour, to the ſteaming ſtewes.
                  
                     Tyber the famous ſinke of Chriſtendome
                  Turn thou to Thames, & Thames rūn towards Rome:
                  
                  What euer damned ſtreame but thine were meete
                  To Quench his luſting liuers boyling heate?
                  Thy double draught may quench his dog-daies rage
                  
                  With ſome ſtale Bacchis, or obſequious page,
                  When writhen Lena makes her ſale-ſet ſhowes
                  Of wooden Venus with faire limned browes;
                  Or like him more ſome vailed Matrons face,
                  Or trained prentiſe trading in the place:
                  The cloſe adultreſſe, where her name is red
                  Coms crauling from her huſbands lukewarme bed,
                  Her carrion skin bedaub'd with odours ſweete,
                  Groping the poſtern with her bared feet.
                  Now play the Satyre who ſo liſt for mee,
                  
                     Valentine ſelfe, or ſome as chaſt as hee.
                  In vaine ſhe wiſheth long Alchmanaes night,
                  Curſing the haſty dawning of the light,
                  And with her cruell Ladie-ſtarre vproſe
                  Shee ſeekes hir third rouſt on her ſilent toes,
                  Beſmeared all with loathſome ſmoke of luſt
                  Like Acherons ſteemes, or ſmoldring ſulphur duſt:
                  Yet all day ſits ſhee ſimpring in her mew
                  
                  Like ſome chaſt dame, or ſhrined ſaynct in ſhew,
                  Whiles hee lies wallowing with a weſtiehed
                  And paliſh carkaſſe, on his Brothel-bed,
                  Till his ſalt bowels boyle with poyſonous fire,
                  Right Hercules with his ſecond Deianire.
                  
                  O Eſculape! how rife is Phiſicke made,
                  When ech Braſſe-baſen can profeſſe the trade
                  Of ridding pockie wretches from their paine,
                  And doe the beaſtly cure for ten-groats gaine?
                  Al theſe & more, deſerue ſome blood-drawne lines:
                  But my ſixe Cords beene of too looſe a twine.
                  Stay till my beard ſhall ſweepe myne aged breſt,
                  Then ſhall I ſeeme an awfull Satyriſt:
                  
                  While now my rimes reliſh of the Ferule ſtill,
                  Some noſe-wiſe Pedant ſaith; whoſe deepe-ſene skil
                  Hath three times conſtrued either Flaccus ore,
                  And thriſe rehearſ'd them in his Triuiall floare,
                  So let them taxe mee for my hote-bloodes rage,
                  Rather than ſay I doted in my age.
               
            
            
               
               SAT. 2.
               Arcades ambo.
               
                  OLD driueling Lolio drudges all he can,
                  To make his eldeſt ſonne a Gentleman.
                  Who can deſpaire that ſees another thriue,
                  By lone of twelue-pence to an Oyſter-wiue?
                  When a craz'd ſcaffold, and a rotten ſtage,
                  Was all rich Naenius his heritage.
                  Nought ſpendeth he for feare, nor ſpares for coſt:
                  And all he ſpendes and ſpaires beſide is loſt;
                  Himſelfe goes patched like ſome bare Cottyer,
                  
                  Leaſt he might ought the future ſtocke appeyre.
                  Let giddie Coſmius change his choyce aray,
                  Like as the Turke his Tents thirſe in a day.
                  
                  And all to ſun and ayre his ſuites vntold
                  From ſpitfull mothes, and frets, and hoary mold,
                  Bearing his paune-layd lands vpon his backe
                  As Snailes their ſhels, or Pedlers do their packe:
                  Who cannot ſhine in tiſſues and pure gold,
                  That hath his lands and patrimony ſold?

                     ough Pampilian
                  
                  Guilded with drops that downe the boſome ran,
                  White Carſy hoſe, patched on eyther knee,
                  The very Embleme of good huſbandrie,
                  And a knit night-cap made of courſeſt twine,
                  With two long labels button'd to his chin;
                  So rides he mounted on the market-day
                  Vpon a ſtraw-ſtuft pannel, all the way,
                  With a maund charg'd with houſhold marchandiſe
                  With egs, or white-meate, from both Dayries:
                  And with that byes he roſt for ſunday-noone,
                  Proud how he made that weeks prouiſion:
                  
                  Elſe is he ſtall-fed on the worky-day
                  With browne-bread cruſts ſoftened in ſodden whey,
                  Or water-grewell, or thoſe paups of meale
                  That Maro makes his Simule, and Cybeale:
                  
                  Or once a weeke perhaps for nouelty,
                  Reez'd Bacon: ſoords ſhall feaſt his familie;
                  And weens this more than one egge cleft in twaine
                  To feaſt ſome patrone and his Chappelaine;
                  Or more than is ſome hungry gallants dole,
                  That in a dearth runs ſneaking to an hole,
                  And leaues his man and dog to keepe his hall
                  Leaſt the wilde roome ſhould run forth of the wall.
                  Good man him liſt nor ſpend his idle meales
                  In quinſing Plouers, or in wining Quales;
                  Nor toot in Cheap ſide baſkets earne and late pleaſe
                  To ſet the firſt tooth in ſome nouell-cate.
                  Let ſweete-mouth'd Mercia bid what crowns ſhe

                  Or the firſt Artichoks of all the yeare,
                  To make ſo lauiſh coſt for little cheare:
                  When Lolio feaſteth in his reueling fit,
                  Some ſterued Pullen ſcoures the ruſted ſpitt.
                  For elſe how ſhould his ſonne maintained bee,
                  At Ins of Court or of the Chancerie:
                  There to learne Law, and courtly carriage,
                  To make amendes for his meane parentage,
                  Where he vnknowne and ruffling as he can,
                  Goes currant each-where for a Gentleman?
                  What Brokers louſy wardrop cannot reach,
                  With tiſſued paines to pranck ech peaſants breech?
                  Couldſt thou but giue the wall, the cap, the knee,
                  To proud Sartorio that goes ſtradling by,
                  Wer't not the needle pricked on his ſleeue
                  Doth by good hap the ſecret watch-word giue?
                  But hear'ſt thou Lolioes ſonne, gin not thy gate,

                  Neuer vntill the lamps of Paules beene light,
                  And niggard lanternes ſhade the Moon-ſhine night,
                  Then when the guiltie bankrupt in bolde dreade,
                  From his cloſe Cabin thruſts his ſhrinking heade,
                  That hath beene long in ſhady ſhelter pent
                  Impriſoned for feare of priſonment.

                  Then once to minge thy fathers odious name,
                  Whoſe mention were alike to thee as leeue,
                  As a Catch-pols fiſt vnto a Bankrupts ſleeue;

                  The Tenants wonder at their land-Lords Sonne,
                  And bleſſe them at ſo ſudden comming on,

                  Nay then his Hodge ſhallleaue the plough & waine,
                  And buy a booke, and go to ſchoole againe:

                  That climbe to honour by the Pulpits ſtayre:

                  To win ſome parched ſhreds of Miniuere,
                  
                  
                  And ſeuen more plod at a Patrons tayle,
                  To get a gelded Chappels cheaper ſayle.
                  Old Lolio ſees and laugheth in his ſleeue,
                  At the great hope they and his ſtate doe giue.
                  But that which glads and makes him proud'ſt of all,
                  Is when the brabling neighbours on him call,
                  For counſell in ſome crabbed caſe of law,
                  Or ſome Indentments, or ſome bond to draw:
                  His Neighbours gooſe hath grazed on his Lea,
                  What action mought be entred in the plea?
                  So new falne lands haue made him in requeſt,
                  That now he lookes as lofty as the beſt.
                  And well done Lolio, like a thrifrie ſyre,
                  T'were pitty but thy ſonne ſhould prooue a ſquire.
                  How I fore ſee in many ages paſt,
                  When Lolioes caytiue name is quite defa'ſt,

                  Shall climbe vp to the Chancell pewes on hie,
                  And rule and raigne in their rich Tenancie;
                  When pearch't aloft to perfect their eſtate
                  They racke their rents vnto a treble rate;
                  And hedge in all the neighbour common-lands,
                  And clodge their ſlauiſh tenant with commaunds,
                  Whiles they, poore ſoules, with feeling ſighs cōplain
                  And wiſh old Lolio were aliue againe,
                  And praiſe his gentle ſoule and wiſh it well
                  And of his friendly facts full often tell.
                  His father dead, tuſh, no it was not hee,

                  And tels how firſt his famous Anceſtor
                  Did come in long ſince with the Conquerour.
                  Nor hath ſome bribed Herald firſt aſſign'd

                  The Scottiſh Barnacle (if I might chooſe)
                  That of a worme doth waxe a winged gooſe;
                  
                  Natheleſſe ſome hungry ſquire for hope of good

                  Than who were borne at two pide painted poſtes;
                  And had ſome traunting Merchant to his ſyre
                  That trafiqu'd both by water and by fyre.
                  O times! ſince euer Rome did Kings create,

                  VVHat boots it Pontice, tho thou could'ſt diſcourſe
                  Of a long golden line of Anceſtors?
                  Or ſhew their painted faces gaylie dreſt,
                  From euer ſince before the laſt conqueſt;
                  Or tedious Bead-roles of deſcended blood,
                  From Father Iaphet ſince Deucalions flood,
                  Or call ſome old Church-windowes to record
                  The age of thy fayre Armes,
                  Or find ſome figures halfe obliterate
                  In rain-beat Marble neare to the Church-gate,
                  
                  Vpon a Croſſe-leg'd Toombe: what boots it thee
                  To ſhew the ruſted Buckle that did tie
                  The Garter of thy greateſt Grand ſires knee?
                  What to reſerue their reliques many yeares,
                  Their ſiluer-ſpurs, or ſpils of booken ſpeares;
                  Or cyte olde Oclands verſe, how they did weild
                  The wars in Turwin, or in Turney field?
                  And if thou canſt in picking ſtrawes engage,
                  In one halfe day thy fathers heritage,
                  Or hide what euer treaſures he the got,
                  In ſome deepe Cock-pit; or in deſperate Lot
                  Vpon a ſixe-ſquare peece of Iuorie,
                  Throw both thy ſelfe, and thy poſteritie?
                  Or if (O ſhame!) in hired Harlots bed
                  Thy wealthie heyre-dome thou haue buried:
                  Then Pontice little boots thee to diſcourſe
                  Of a long golden line of Anceſtors.
                  Ventrous Fortunio his farme hath ſold,
                  
                  And gads to Guiane land to fiſh for gold,
                  Meeting perhaps, if Orenoque denye,
                  Some ſtragling pinnace of Polonian Rie.
                  Then comes home floting with a ſilken ſayle,
                  That Seuerne ſhaketh with his Canon-peale;
                  Wiſer Raymundus in his cloſet pent,
                  Laughs at ſuch danger and aduenturement;
                  When halfe his lands are ſpent in golden ſmoke,
                  And now his ſecond hopefull glaſſe is broke.
                  But yet if haply his third fornace hold,
                  Devoteth all his pots and pans to gold;
                  So ſpend thou Pontice, if thou canſt not ſpare,
                  Like ſome ſtout ſa-man or Philoſopher;
                  
                  And were thy fathers gentle? that's their praiſe,
                  No thanke to thee by whom their name decays;
                  By vertue got they it, and valourous deed,
                  Do thou ſo Pontice, and be honoured:
                  But elſe looke how their vertue was their owne,
                  
                  Not capable of propagation,
                  Right ſo their titles beene, nor can be thine,
                  Whoſe ill deſerts might blanke their golden line.
                  Tell me, thou gentle Troian; doſt thou priſe
                  Thy brute beaſts worth by their dams qualities?
                  Say'ſt thou this Colt ſhall prooue a ſwift-pac'd ſteed
                  Onely becauſe a Iennet did him breed?
                  Or ſay'ſt thou this ſame Horſſe ſhall win the prize,
                  Becauſe his dame was ſwifteſt Trunchefice,
                  
                  Or Runceuall his Syre; himſelfe a Gallaway?
                  
                  Whiles like a tireling Iade he lags half-way;
                  Or whiles thou ſeeſt ſome of thy Stallion-race,
                  
                  Their eyes boar'd out, masking the Millers-maze,
                  Like to a Scythian ſlaue ſworne to the payle;
                  Or dragging froathy barrels at his tayle?
                  Albee wiſe Nature in her prouidence,
                  Wont in the want of reaſon and of ſence,
                  Traduce the natiue vertue with the kind,
                  
                  Making all brute and ſenceleſſe things inclin'd,
                  Vnto their cauſe, or place where they were ſowne
                  That one is like to all, and all like one.

Let my ſecond ground be, the well knowne daintines of the time, ſuch, that men rather chooſe careleſly to leaſe the ſweete of the kernell, than to vrge their teeth with breaking of the ſhell wherein it is wrapped: and therfore ſith that which is vnſeene is almoſt vn

            Notwithſtanding in the expectation of this quarrell, I thinke my firſt Satyre doth ſomewhat reſemble the ſoure and crabbed face of Iuuenals, which I indeauouring in that, did determinately omit in the reſt, for theſe forenamed cauſes, that ſo I might haue ſomewhat to ſtoppe the mouth of euery accuſer.
