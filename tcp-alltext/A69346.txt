And sometimes it is taken fo hys truth & faythfulnes in the performyng of hys ꝓmise, & of this is he called iust or ryghtwise, faith full and true.

Whyche shuld be the occasyon of fornicaciō & adultery both to them that were thē maryd and to theyr wyues▪ These wordes spake Papbuncius in the presens of all the counsel: notwithstanding yet he him selfe

Oh good God, howe many soules haue they drawen wyth theyr selues to hell by this one law wyth forbydding man & womā to marye. What burninges, what concupiscēces and vnlaw full lustes haue thys Synagoge of Satan caused and compelled to raygne and to be karyed aboute in these persōes hartes daye and nyght, that wold marye and maye, and dare not? ye what adultery fornicacion wyth other vs clennesses foloweth vp pon this deuelles she doctrine and law of forbyddin ge matrimonye?

For the man was hole and cleane bothe body and soule before he bad hym go for hys fayth first had purified his harte▪ and then Christe healed hys bodye, for Chrystes cures were perfite in healynge the hole man. Nowe this man healed, Chryste bad hym go shewe hym selfe to the preiste, he bad hym not go shryue hym selfe to the preyste. He bad hym go shew hys skinne and body For the prestes office was to iuge & to decerne whe ther the leprye was gone or not, and to dyspose the offeryng for the clensyng of the sore, and to haue a good porcyon therof for hys duty, as ye may reade Leuitici in the. 13. and. 14. chapter, and as the terte folowing in Mathew declareth, yf you wold▪ diligently note it, and conferre the lawe and the Gospell togyther and remember that Chryst sayd he came not to breake Moses lawe but to fulfil it Christe therfore wolde not defraude them of the

               ¶ The storie of my state, after the bishop had receyued the pryours letters.
               
                  ON the Saterdaye seuennyght before aduent sondaye, the yeare of our Lorde. M. D. XXUII. there were letters sent as from the Car dinall by one of hys offycers to Cambrydge, delyuered to the vyce Canceller called Doctour Edmonds master of Peter college, where I was thē feolwe. In whyche letters he was commaunded to sense me vp to appeare at Westminster y• wendesdaye folowyng at. ix. of the clok wyth Bylney and Arture, for certayne erroneus opynyons. &c. Our master sent for me on the 
                     ••
                  orow in to the cō trey, and I came to hym, on the mondaye. He shewed me the letters, I red them, and sawe the Cardinals sygne manuell subscrybed in great letters▪ and his seale. I gote me horse when it snewed, and was colde, and came to Londen and so to Westmynster not longe after my howre, when Bilney and Arture were in examinacyon. Whyche thynge when I harde of, and knewe but those two poore shepe amonge so many cruel wolues I was not ouer hastye to thruste in amōge them, for there w

                   with other of theyr factiō. And I thought to heare howe these two lytell lambes shulde spede yere I wold put my selfe into those lyōs mouthes. I wēt to my diner & taried walkyng in the cyte. At last on the Saterday I came to a Master of myne called syr Wyllyam Gascoingue, the Cardinales tresurer: and shewed hym my errende, but he knewe all the cōuayaunce of my cause better thē I (for I beleue yet he was the author of all my trouble) and he had me go in to the chamber of presēs & there do ctour Capon shuld present me to the Cardinall. I was but a course courtyer neuer before hearynge this terme chāber of presēce ne knew where it was and I was halfe a shamed to aske after it, & went in to alonge entrye on the lefte hande, and at laste happened vpon a dore & knocked, and one opened it & when I loked in, it was the kichē, then I went backe into the hall, & asked for the chamber of presence & one poynted me vp a payer of stayers. The re stode I in the chamber of presēce when I wold wyth all my harte haue ben absent, waytynge for doctour Capō almost an hower, for I was not ouer hasty to aske after hym, there no mā knew me nor I them, there was a great fyer in the chamber the wether was colde, and I saw now and than a Bishop come out, but I durste not stand nyghe the fyer for feare of burnyng, theyr was in all aboute a dosen bishops, whose solemne and lordely loky

conuayaunce, & howe they had counterfeted theyr lordes the Cardinales letters. And here the tresurer sent me to the bishope of Lyncolne, tellynge me that a suffragane had accused me. Whych suffragane I neuer see nor knew. I wēt a good pase toward the bisshops place & ouertoke hys chaunceler called doctour Rains shewing him y• I wold spea ke wyth my lord, he shewed my lord of me and said that I must come againe the mornyng at vi. of the clocke I d
                     •
                  d so, & wayted for my lorde at the stayers fote til it was about. viii. My lord came down and I dyd my dutye to hym, he asked me, be you M. Iove? ye forsothe my lorde ꝙ I. Abyde said he wyth my Chaunceler tyll I come agayne (for my lord wt all the bishopes toke theyr barges to wayte vpon the Cardinall that mornyng to Grenewiche to the kyng) I desired my lord to be good lord vnto me & shew me eys pleasure, what hys lordshype wold wt me, & wherfore I am thus sent vnto hym: and he answered me like a lord & bad me tary with his chaunceler & sayd I shuld wayte vpō his laiser there toke I my leue of my lord & saw him nomore ¶ Then bycause M. Gascoigne rode home ye same day into Bedforde shier, & bad me ouer euen to come againe on the morow & tell him how I sped: I desyerde M. chaunceler to go to him promisyng to come agayne at such a time as he wold apointe me at my lordes coming home, for he tolde me that my lord wold come agayne the same day about. ii. or, iii. of the cloke. I came to M. Gascoing whych I perceyued by his wordes fauored me not, & he re buked me because I studied Arigene, whych was an heretike said he, & he said y• I helde such opiniōs as did Bilney & Arture: which discōforted me very sore, whē I perceyued him to be my enemye whom I toke for my good master: there I saw hym laste

                   houre & shewed my selfe to M. chaūceler. And there daunsed I a colde attendance tyll all most nyght, & yet my lord was not come, then I wēt to M. chaū celer wyth whō was Watson the scribe, desyryng him that I mought departe for I though my lord wold not come home that nyght, sayng that I had farre to my lodging, & I loued not to walke late lo the they were I perceyued, and especially the scribe that I shulde go: but they wolde nether byd me to supper nor promyse me lodgynge, & I made haste sayng that I wold come agayne on the morow to se & my lord were come home. Then sayd the scribe where is your lodgīg? & here I was so bold to ma ke the scribe a lye for hys askyng, telling hym that I laye at the grene drogon toward Bisshops gate when I laye a myle of, euen a contrary waye, for I neuer trusted Scribes nor pharisais, & I perceyued he asked me not for any good. Here I bad thē bothe good nyght. As I wēt now I thought thus with my selfe, I am a scholer of Cambridge vnder only y• vice chaūcelers iurisdictiō & vnder the great God the Cardinal, & M. Gascoinge said the Cardinall sent not for me, I wyll take a brethe yere I come to these mē agayne. On the morowe I was not ouer hastie to come to the chaunceler, but as I walked in the citie, I met wt a scoler of Cambrydg and he tolde me y• the bisshop of Lincolne had sent hys seruaunt besely to enquire & to seke me, what is the matter ꝙ I?
