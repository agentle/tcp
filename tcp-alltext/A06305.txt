thy great wiſdome and power, haſt created and
made heauen and earth, the Sea, and all things conteined
therein, and haſt made man thy moſt principall
and excellent creature, and giuen him wiſdome
to rule and gouerne all other Creatures, with commaundement
to ſerue and honor thée, and to doo ſuch
workes as are moſt acceptable to thy godly will.
And of thine aboundant grace haſt endewed thy ſeruant,
a good brother of our Company with that pitifull
mind to conſider his poore and néedy brethren,
and to bée the donor of this bleſſed Charitie, whereby
both I, and others poore and néedie aged, are daily
relieued. And as I do acknowledge the ſame to procéede
of thy grace, ſo I giue thée moſt high and harty
thankes therefore, and with my whole hart, I humbly beſéech thée, to bleſſe the true Catholike
Church here in Earth, and in it this Church of England, and long to preſerue our noble
Quéene, with her honorable Counſell, and to proſper our Company, the Marchanttaylors in
generall, and euery particular member of the ſame, and to aſſiſt them with thy continuall
fauour, to ſhew more ſuch déedes of mercy and pitie, for reliefe of the poore diſtreſſed, for the
which thou haſt promiſed, of thy mercy ſpeciall reward, by the mouth of Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour.
And likewiſe I beſéech thée. Oh Lord to kéepe and preſerue this noble Citie of London,
and to proſper it with thy bleſſings of health, and wealth, vnder our moſt godly and peaceable
Prince, and to giue vnto all the Companies, and members of the ſame, thy grace to ſhew
themſelues alwaies thankfull, in doing ſuch workes as are beſt pleaſing to thy diuine Maieſtie.
Graunt this Oh Father, for Ieſus Chriſt thy déere Sonnes ſake, to whom with the
holy Ghoſt the Comforter, thrée perſons in one eternall godhead, be all hononr, dominion,
power, and glory, both now and for euermore. Amen.
