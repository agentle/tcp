Shewing it forth in every degree:
               Shee being left as one forlorne,
               With ſorrowes ſhee her ſelfe to adorne,
               And ſeemes for to lament and mourne.
            
            To a delicate new tune.
            
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  YOu Maids and wiues, and women kind,
                  Giue eare, and you ſhall heare my mind,
                  Wherein Ile ſhew moſt perfectly,
                  A falſe Young-mans inconſtancie:
                  
                     For which I ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee falſe men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  I loue where I haue cauſe to hate,
                  Such is my fooliſh fickle ſtate,
                  My time I ſpend in griefe and woe,
                  Which, ſure will be my ouerthrow:
                  I ſigh, and ſob, and then doe weepe,
                  For that falſe men no faith can keepe.
               
               
                  My Loue to me doth proue vntrue,
                  And ſeemes to bid me now adieu:
                  O hatefull wretch, and moſt vnkind,
                  To beare ſo falſe and wicked mind:
                  
                     It makes me ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee falſe men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  Hee's fled and gone, for which I grieue,
                  I wiſh no Maiden him beleiue,
                  For he with tempting ſpeeches will
                  Seeke others now for to beguile:
                  
                     
                        
                           •
                        hat they with me may ſigh and weepe,
                  
                  
                     And ſay that men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  Shall I be bound that may be free?
                  Shall I loue them that loue not me?
                  Why ſhould I thus ſeeme to complaine?
                  I ſee I cannot him obtaine.
                  
                     Which makes me ſob, and ſigh, and weep,
                  
                  
                     To ſee that men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  O ſhall I weepe, or ſhall I ſing?
                  I know not which will at mourning:
                  If that I weepe twill breed me pains,
                  If that I ſing twill eaſe my braine:
                  
                     Therefore Ile ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee falſe men no faith can keepe,
                  
               
               
                  The Iewel's loſt, the thiefe is fled,
                  And I lie wounded in my bed:
                  If to repent I ſhould begin,
                  They'l ſay twas I that let him in:
                  
                     Therefore Ile ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee falſe men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  My mind to him was alwaies true,
                  For which I now haue cauſe to me:
                  Would I had neuer ſeene his face,
                  Nor tredethe pathes of Cupids race:
                  
                     For now I ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee falſe men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
            
            
               
               The ſecond part,
               To the ſame tune.
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  VVHat hay hath any hee or ſhee,
                  That can but liue at libertie,
                  And not be troubled as I am,
                  As by my Song you vnderſtand,
                  
                     It makes me ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee falſe men no ſaith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  I cannot take my quiet reſt,
                  To thinke on him that I lou'd beſt:
                  Sometimes when I doe thinke to ſleepe,
                  Then thought of him makes me to weep:
                  
                     I cannot chooſe but ſigh, and ſob,
                  
                  
                     To thinke of him that doth me rob.
                  
               
               
                  Tis true indeed he robbeth me,
                  Of my content and libertie:
                  My heart can now no comfort find,
                  To thinke on him that proues vnkind:
                  
                     I cannot chuſe but ſigh and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee falſe men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  My head doth ake, mine eyes are ſore,
                  And I can find no helpe therefore:
                  My body's faint, and I am weake,
                  My tongue is tyed▪ I cannot ſpeake:
                  
                     Yet ſtill I ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee that men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  My daies are ſhort, my life's not long,
                  I cannot well declare my wrong:
                  Yet in ſome part, I here doe ſhow,
                  That you the cauſe hereof may know:
                  
                     Wherefore I ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee that men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  His tempting eies, and ſmiling lookes,
                  Now ſeeme to me like baited hookes,
                  Which are but laid for to betray
                  The Fiſh that's greedy of his prey:
                  
                     Therefore I ſob, and ſigh, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee that men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  When firſt with me he came in place,
                  He did me with his armes imbrace:
                  He kiſt me on't, and ſwore that he
                  Would neuer haue no one but me:
                  
                     Yet now he makes me ſob and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee that men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  With words moſt faire he did intreat,
                  Vntill my fauour he did get:
                  But him vncertaine I doe find.
                  And changing like the wauering wind:
                  
                     Which makes me ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee that men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  He vow'd to beare a faithfull mind,
                  But he is otherwiſe inclin'd:
                  He now doth ſeeme as ſtrange to me,
                  I cannot haue his companie:
                  
                     Which makes me ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee that men no faith can keepe.
                  
               
               
                  Thus ſeemes my Loue to doe me wrong,
                  Wherefore Ile here conclude my Song:
                  Ile neuer truſt falſe men no more,
                  Nor doe as I haue done before:
                  
                     For which I ſigh, and ſob, and weepe,
                  
                  
                     To ſee that men no faith can keepe.
