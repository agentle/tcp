               f with all thy strength thou endeuourest, that thou mayst alwayes haue with thee this presence and remembrance of the Lord: for it shall much benefit and profit thee to consider that God is alwayes and euery where present, not onely by his power and presence, but also by his essence.
            
               
A King in all his territories is present by his power, and in his pallace by his presence, but by his essence, he is no where but in that place, which possesseth his body: God after all these waies is present in euery place. Which besides God is present euery where. our faith, this reason doth also prooue: It is God that giueth to all creatures to bee and to liue: God is the beginning and cause of all thinges. But seeing that it is necessary that the cause be ioyned with the effect, eyther by it selfe, or by some vertue or influence, it followeth, that sithence God is the cause of all things, that they are, that hee is also ioyned vnto them, giuing them to bee, that they are: and that not by some vertue or influence, but by himselfe: for in God there is that distinction of things, which is in the creatures.
            
               
For whatsoeuer is in God, is of God, and therefore wheresoeuer 
                  •…
               e willeth, that somthing of him should be, he is all that.
            And because the Essence of thinges is the neerest vnto the things, neither is any thing more inward in them, it followeth that God is more in them, then the thinges are in themselues. What great thing is it then, if thou hast God alwaies before thyne eyes, who carrieth thee in hys armes, who supporteth thee with his feete, who gouerneth thee by his prouidence, in whom & by whom thou liuest & hast thy being? Remēber that he alwaies assisteth thy soule as the creature and gouernour, who preserueth thee in thine Essence, neither is he content that he assisteth thee as thy creator and preseruer, but also hee is present with thee as

thy iustifier, bestowing vpon thee grace, loue and many holy inspirations & desires. Let him be the witnes of thy life, let him be the companion of thy pilgrymage, commit vnto him part of thy busines, commend thy selfe vnto him in all thy perils and dangers, in the night talke with him in thy sleep, and with him awake in the morning.
            Sometymes contemplate him as a glorious God among his Angels in heauen: sometimes as a mortall man among men, conuersant vpon the earth: now in the bosome of his Father, now in the armes of his mother▪ a little after wayte vpon him flying into Egipt, thence returne again with him out of Egipt: somtimes ioyne thy selfe vnto him praying in the Garden, somtimes followe him to the Mount

euen of Caluary, neyther forsake hym hanginge on the Crosse.
            When thou sittest downe at the Table, let his Gall and Vineger bee the sauce of thy meate, and let the Fountayne of the bloode (flowing from his most Noble and glorious breast) bee the cup out of which thou drynkest. When thou goest to bed, imagine thy bed to bee his Crosse, and thy Pillow his Crowne of Thornes: when thou puttest off or on thy cloathes, meditate with what great ignominye Chryste in his passion was sometymes arrayed and sometymes spoyled of his garmentes.
            This is with those holy Virgins to followe the Lambe, whether soeuer hee goeth: by thys meanes thou mayest bee

be a Disciple of Christ, & alwayes remaine in his companye. In all these thinges alwayes talke with him with hūble speeches & full of loue: so he wil haue him self delt with, who for the greatnes of his Maiesty ought worthily to be feared, and for his goodnes, exceedingly to be loued.
            Although thou be busied with some manuall labour, or with any other busines, yet for this thou must not omit nor intermit this holy exercise. For the Lord hath giuen this aptnes and promptnes to our heartes, that in a moment they may be turned vnto him, albeit the body remain occupyed in an externall worke; none otherwaies then an handmayde who A Simily. worketh in ye
                presence of a Queen, she standeth before her Lady with great grauitye, with presentnes of minde, and orderly composition

of body, making neither losse nor delay in her worke; that one busines hindreth not another, so also our heart with due reuerence and attention, may be lifted vp to that maiestye, which filleth heauen & earth, not omitting norneglecting any of those thinges it doth.
            Neither only when a man doth attend vpon any manuall labour, but also when he speaketh, studyeth or is busied, &c. he may somtimes haue his heart attentiue to his busines, and yet neuertheles enter into the temple of his heart, to worship the Lord, & withdraw himself from those things, which his busines requires, and speedily returne vnto GOD. Those holy creaturs are a figure of this, which Ezechiel sawe cōming and going in the likenes of bright lightning, wherby we vnderstand the swiftnes & alacrity, by which the righteous

ought to be turned vnto the Lord, whē as vpon some godly & religious occasion they goe out of the closset of their deuotiō, to succour and releeue their neighbour. But if at any time a man shall linger & loyter & forget to returne vnto God, he must be stirred vp with the spurs of attentiō and diligence, by turning the reynes of his heart vnto God, & saying with the Prophet; Returne O my soule into rest, because the Lord hath blessed 
               Psal. 114. 
               thee.
            
         
         
            THE FIFT THING that stirreth vp Deuotion, is the vse of short Prayers, which in al places & seasons, are as dartes, to be sent vnto God. CHAP. VIII.
            
            VVIthout doubt that man is exceding happy, that

knoweth well to obserue & keep the precedent instruction and document. But that no man may fayle in it, it is most profitable in all places and seasons to vse those short & succinct prayers, of which Augustine speaketh. The brethrē (saith he) are said to haue in Egipt August. to Proba. oftē & frequent prayers, but those very short, & sodenly dartedforth: least that erected and aduaunced vigilancy (which is very necessary for him that prayeth) vanish away through long delay, and too much prolixitie. Euen as they that inhabite the North partes of the A Simily. world, where the cold is vehemēt, do keep within doores, and in hot houses to defend themselues from the iniury and vntemperatenes of the weather: but they that cannot do this, come oftē to ye fire, & being somwhat warmed, do returne againe to their labour: so also the

seruant of God, liuing in this cold and miserable regiō of the world, where charity is waxen key colde, and iniquity doth rage & abound, must often repayre to the fire of prayer, that he may grow warme. He is truly happy, to whome it is giuen alwayes to sit in that hothouse, of which the Prophet speaketh: And he shal be as one, that it is hid from the wind, & couered from 
               Esay. 32. 
               the tempest. But let him that cannot haue this, often come to this Diuine fire, that hee may defend him selfe from windes, and from the intollerable ycenes of the frozen region of this world.
            Hetherto belong these short & succinct Prayers, which for this cause are called darting, because as it were are the darts of a louing soule, which with great celerity are shot forth, and do wound the heart of God: by force of which,

the soule is stirred vp, and is more enflamed with the loue of God. Very many versès of Dauid are profitable & conducent vnto this purpose, which a man ought alwaies to haue in readines, that by them he may be lifted vp vnto God: not alwaies after the same manner, least the assiduity of the same wordes breed wearines, but with all variety of affections, which the holy Ghost doth stirre and rayse vp in his soule: for hee shall finde conuenient and meete verses for all these in this heauenly seminary of Psalmes.
            Sometimes he may lift vp his heart by the affection of repentance, and desire of remission of sinnes, by these wordes: Turne away thy face, O Lord, from my 
               Psal. 51. 
               sinnes, and put away allmine iniquitities. Erect in me a cleane hart, O God, and renue a right spirit

within me. Sometimes he may say with the affection of thankfulnes: My soule, praise thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefites. Sometimes Psal. 103. hee may say with the affection of Loue and Charitye; I will loue thee deerely, O Lord my strength. The Lord is my rocke, my 
               Psal. 18. 
               fortresse, & hee that deliuereth me, my God, & my strength, in him will I trust. As the Hart brayeth for the riuers of water, so panteth my soule 
               Psal. 42. 
               after thee O God. My soule thirsteth for God, euen for the liuing God: when shall I come & appeere before the presence of God? My teares haue beene my meate day & night, while they daylye say vnto me, where is thy God? Afterwards being inflamed with the loue of eternal happines, let him crye: O Lord of hostes, how amiable are thy Tabernacles? My 
               Psal. 84. 
               soule longeth, yea, & fainteth for the courtes of the Lord. Saint Hierome
               
writeth in a certaine Epistle, that the Fathers of Egipt had wont to haue very often in their mouthes, a short verse of the same Prophet, and to say; O that I had wings like 
               Psal. 55. 
               a doue, then wold I fly away & rest. Somtimes with a confession of his owne misery, & a desire of the diuine grace let him cal; Incline thine 
               Psal. 86. 
               eare, O Lord, & heare me: for I am poore & needy. And to cōclude let this breefe verse be very often in our speeches & conferences: O God, hast thee to deliuer me: make hast to help me, O Lord. In like Psal. 70. manner let the times & places, & businesses, which we attend, and Of al things we must take an occasion of Deuotion. whatsoeuer we see or heare minister occasiō by other meanes and affections to lift vp our harts vnto God: for he that loueth God truly be holdeth God in al things, & thinketh that al things doe inuite him vnto his loue. In the morning

the chirping & harmony of birds, in the night silence & quiet calmnes inuite vs to praise the Lord. In our eating, the grace, which is bestowed vpō our meates for our satisfying: when in the morning wee arise, the grace which hath kept vs in our sleep, & that wee are refreshed with it: the beauty of the Sunne and starres, and the decking & embellishment of the fieldes doe intimate & insinuate vnto vs the prouidence & beautie of our Creator, and the misery & calamity of other creatures doth witnes and testifie vnto vs the diuine grace, which God vseth in freeing and deliuering them.
            When the clocke giueth a signe of the passed hower, let vs call to mind the hower of our death; & also that hower, in which God vouchsafed to dye for vs, & let vs read & meditate on those words,

which a holy Father teacheth, saying: Blessed be the houre in which my Lord Iesus Christ was born & dyed for me. So oftē as any temptation doth assaile vs, or any impure or hurtfull thought doth enter into vs, praier is very necessary to cast it out of our harts. In like manner as often as we enterprize and vndertake to doe any thing, wherein we feare that wee shall find contradictions & hindrances, or dread new occasions of daungers, it behooueth vs to defence and arme our selues with the weapons of Prayer: When we at any time goe out of our doores, when we are to haue busines with a wrangling & a contentious mā, or to deale in any matter of great moment & consequence, when wee come to a banket, wherein there is danger of sinning, eyther through gluttony, or too much

talke, in these and suth like matters a great preparation of Prayer is to be sent before. By this means all thinges will become motiues vnto vs to haue alwaies somthing to doe with God, & of all things we shall receiue fruite, and at all times haue occasion to pray. This is that continuall exercise, to the which the Apostleinuiteth vs, saying: Touching & admonishing your own selues, in Psalmes, & hymmes, 
               Col. 3. 
               & spiritual songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoeuer ye shal doe, in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Iesus, giuing thankes to God euen the Father by him.
            
            This exercise very much helpeth to Deuotion: for it is as the watchman & keeper of the house watching that none beside God enter to take possession of ye soule. It is profitable also to preserue the

heate of Deuotion: hence it is, that they that are freequent in this consideration, doe very easily call vnto them their minds, & gather together their sences and spirits, when they are to pray.
            For what other cause, doest thou think there is, that one forth with at the beginning of prayer doth enioy tranquility and peace of minde, an other scarcely aftermany houres, & after long praier can quiet his heart & make it peace able? The cause is obuious & common, because the one hath his heart gathered vnto him & warmed with these short & succinct prayers: the other through forgetfulnes of God is waxen key cold, & therefore the one sooner waxeth hot, the other later. Wee A Simily. see this in a fornace, which if it be wel heated in ye morning, is kept hot all the day after with a little

fire: but if it grow stone colde againe, it requires a great deale of fire, before it be thorowly heated again: so it is necessary that they doe, that will be deuout, that this diuine heate may be preserued in their hearts, vnlesse they will vndergoe new troubles in heating them so often as they goe to pray. For the Deuoton of our heart is A Simily. as heate in water, or in yron, which naturally is cold, but accidentally hot: for when it is taken frō the fire, of which it was made hot, foorth with it returneth to his former and proper estate & condition. He therefore that would alwaies keep yron hot, it behooueth him either alwaies to keep it in the fire, or often to put it into ye fire, that so the external heat may be kept in it: the same diligence is necessary in the nourishing and warming of our hearts.
         
         
            
            THE SIXT THING that encreaseth deuotion, is the reading of deuout & profitable books. CHAP. IX.
            
            THe Deuout reading of spirituall bookes is very conducent and much auayleth to this keeping & purity of ye hart: for as Bernard saith: our heart is like a mill, which neuer resteth, but alwaies grindeth that which is cast into it: if it be wheate, it grindeth wheate: if barly, it grindeth barly. Therefore it is profitable to be busied & occupied in the reading of holy and sacred bookes, that when it doth cōsider & meditate vpon any thing, it may meditate vpon things, which it is busied & occupied in. For this cause Saint

               Hierome in all his Epistles doth so much commend the reading of the holy Scripture, but especially in that, which he writ to the Virgin Demetria, in the beginning whereof he saith thus. Hierome in an Epistle to the Virgin Demetria. Cap. 5.
               
                  Thou sacred Virgin alwaies haue this care
                  And let it dayly be thy foode and fare:
               
            
            That thou nourish thy minde and feede thy soule with the holy reading of the sacred Scriptures, and not suffer the seedes of tares and darnell to fall into the good ground of thine heart. In the end of the same Epistle hee doth repeate In the last Chap. the foresaid counsel, saying: I ioyne the end to the beginning, neyther am I content once to haue admonished thee, loue the holy Scriptures, and Wisedome will loue thee: loue her, and shee will preserue thee: honor her, and she will embrace thee.
         
         
            
            THE SEAVENTH thing that begetteh Deuotion, is the keeping of the senses. CHAP. X.
            
            THe keeping of the senses shall very much help to the keeping of the heart: for these be as it were the gates of the Citty, by which all things enter in & go out: he therfore that keepeth wel these gates, vnto him all thinges shal be in safety. It is needful therfore that one keeper & watchmā be set ouer the eyes, another ouer the eares, & a third ouer ye
                mouth: for by these three gates all wares and Marchandize, & whatsoeuer is in the world, is caried into the soule, and exported out of it. So that a deuout man ought to bee deafe, dum and blind, as the holy

Fathers in Egipt were wont to say: For the gates of these senses being shut, the soule will alwaies be pure and prepared to the contemplation of heauenly thinges.
            For a man must sometimes of necessity heare & see those things which are the causes of distraction and perturbation: wherefore let him so heare and see outward things, that they doe not contaminate his heart. The seruant of God ought to haue his heart as a strong wall, and as a ship well built, soundly ioynted, and surely pitched, which easily repelleth the billowing waues, and albeit couered with them, yet neyther admitteth nor receiueth any into her womb. It may be to figure out this, God commaunded Noah to to make his Arke bowing & vawted, & to pitch it well within and without: for such an one ought to

be the arke of our hart, that in the midst of the waters, & in the tempestuous deluge of this world it may be secure, & admit no waters of iniquity. They that keep their hearts after this manner, are alwaies peaceable, of a present mind, & deuout: but they that open the gates to al winds, and admit all affections & hurly burlies of this world, in the time of praier they are distracted with many contentions, warres & disturbed troublesome cogitations. It hapneth A Simily. vnto these as to those, who go to parle & confer with a Prince with a stomacke loaden & ouercharged with grosse and vndigestible meates, who in the midst of their speech doe filthily vomitte foorth, what they haue greedily deuoured: so these also in the fittest & most conuenient time of praier talking with God, do belch

foorth the garlicke and onions of Egipt, that is, cogitations and businesses of the world, of which their hearts are ful. Such in vaine doe expect fruite of their paryers: for that curse of the Patriarke is proper vnto them, saying: Thou wast light as water, thou shalt not be 
               Gen. 49. 
               excellent. For they haue a heart so light and powred foorth, & busied with externall matters, that they so much the lesse increase within, as they are powred foorth about outward things. Such are they, that whole daies together walke abroad to see lofty buildings, sumptuous houses, magnificent temples, & such like thinges: who are desirous to see faire and beautiful sights, & to heare news: for they return to ye
                houses of their harts ful of wind, & empty of Deuotiō. These as they are wandring & vnstable in their soules, so also

are they in their bodies: for they can scarely abide one moment in one place: but run vp & down frō one place to another: & whē they haue not whether to goe, they folow whether ye
                winde leads them, seeking if they may find any thing abroad to delight them, because within thē they haue lost true delight & ioy. It hapneth also often times, that in such like wayes the deuill is their leader & guid, and doth lead them as he in times past led Dinah into vnhonest places, where they do not only lose their deuotion, but also their chastity & innocency. Therfore it is needfull that we eschew all these distractions & perturbatiōs, that all ye
                strē
               gth of our souls being gathred together, we may haue greater fortitude to seek for ye
                chiefest good: for it is writtē; The lord building vp 
               Psal. 147. 
               Ierusalem, doth gather together the dispersed of Israel.
            
            
               
But amongst all the owtward members, the tongue is especially Ber. in his Sermon of the threefold keeping of the tongue, the hands & the heart. to bee kept: for it is as Bernard saith, a small member, but vnlesse thou take heed vnto it a great euil, little and narrow, saith he it is, but an instrument most fit to euacuate and emptie the heart. It cannot be spoken how soone and easilye the iuyce of deuotion fadeth and vanisheth away, when the mouth is opened to speake superfluous things, albeit they be good. Therfore it is very well spoken of a certaine D
                  •…
               ctor: as sweet water standing A Simily. in an open vessell, hauing no couer, dooth forthwith loose the sweetnes and grace of the sent: so the sweet and precious oyntment of deuotion, dooth loose all the vertue and efficacye, when the mouth is loosed & dissolute, that is, when the tongue doth lauish & superabound in too much talke

and prattle. Therfore it is best to be silent
                  •…
               , and if at anye time it be needful to speake, yet speedily with the Dove returne into the Gen. 8. Arke, least thou perish in the Deluge of wordes.
            And although moderation bee necessarye for all, yet it is more to be obserued of women then of men: but especiallye of Virgins, whose chiefest ornament is shamfastnes, and silence: both beeing the keepers and preseruers of chastitye. Wherefore Saint Ambrose verye well admonisheth a Virgin in these woordes. O Virgin bee circumspect and choyce in thy way, least thou offend in thy tongue: for often times good words in Virgins are taken for faultes.
         
         
            
            THE EIGHT THING that encreaseth Deuotion, is solitarines. CHAP. XI.
            
            EXteriour solitarines doth also verye much help this keeping of the senses & the heart, as a certaine Schoole-man testifieth in these words: Solitarines seemeth much to auaile to the contemplation of heauenly thinges: for prayer cānot well & decently be performed in tumultes & hurly burlies, and to heare and see manye things can scarcely be done without impuritye and offence. For death entreth by our windowes vnto our soules: & therfore after the example of our Lord goe into the desert, that is, as much as thou canst, seperate thy selfe from the company of others, & be solitary, if thou wilt be ioyned vnto him, &

see him by the purity of thy heart: flye also the frequent meetings & talkatiue conferences, especially of worldly persons. Seeke not for newe deuotions & amities: fill not thine eyes & eares with vaine fantasies, & eschew all things, which disturbe & trouble ye
                quyet of the minde, and the tranquilitye of the soule, as venemous & hurtfull to the soule. For not without cause the holy Fathers desired to liue in woods, and in places farre remote from the company & frequenting of men. This saith the schoolman. But that thou maist be more confirmed & strengthned in this, hear what Saint Bernard saith: If thou Bern. in his 40. Sermon vpon the Canticles. beest mooued with the prouocation & instigation of the holy spirit, & dost by all meanes endeuor to make thy soule the spouse of God, sit by the Prophet solitarily, because thou hast lifted thy selfe

aboue thy selfe, longing to be espoused to the Lord of Angels. Lament. 3. Is it not aboue thy selfe to be ioyned vnto God, and to be one spirit with him? Sit solitarilye as a Tvrtle, haue nothing to doe with thy selfe, nor with the multitude and throng of others, yea forget Psal. 44. thine owne people & thy Fathers house, and the King shal haue plesure in thy beautye. O holy soule get thee aparte, that thou maist perform thy seruice to him alone, whome thou hast made choyce of before all others. Flye publicke assemblyes, auoide also those that are domesticall with thee: seperate thy selfe from thy friendes & from them that are the neerest vnto thee, and from him that ministreth vnto thee. Doost thou not knowe that thy bridegroome is shamefast, and will not affoord thee his sweete and pleasant prepresence,

others being present? Therefore seperate thy selfe not in body, but in minde: but in intention, but in deuotiō, but in spirit. For the spirit before thy face is Christ thy Lord, and the spirit requireth not solitarines of body: albeit somtimes seperate thy selfe in body, when thou maist doe it fitly, especially in the time of prayer. And afterwardes: Thou art alone if thou thinkest not vpon common matters, if thou dost not affect thinges present, if thou dispisest that which manye loue, if thou cōtemnest that which many desire, if thou eschewest brawlings, if thou dost not languish for losses, if thou dost not remember iniuryes: otherwayes although thou beest alone in body, yet thou art not alone. Doost thou not see that thou maist bee alone, yea among many? & seeing yu
                art alone

amonge manye, thou art alone in what assemblye of people soeuer thou art: only beware that thou be not too curious a searcher, or too rash a iudge of other mens conuersations. Hetherto Bernard.
            
            Therfore let a deuout man loue and seeke for solitarines, not only that which is internall, but also that which is externall: for it is certaine that the one is helped by the other. It is reported that Arsenius heard a voyce saying vnto him: Arsenius flye, be silent & at rest. Let euery one think that the same is also spoken vnto him, and let him fly and auoyd all kinde of commerce, society, conuersation, conference, consolation, visitation, yea of friendes and parents, vnlesse eyther charitye require it, or necessitye commaund it. Let a man alwayes desire to be alone, let him meditate with himselfe,

let him liue to himselfe, & let him confer with God, who is the louer of solitarines.
            And let no man think that such a life is full of melancholye and heauines: it is so much the more delectable and pleasant, by how much the societie and familiaritie with God is sweeter, then that which is with men. For this cause Saint Hierome saith: The towne Hierome in his Epist. is a prison vnto me, but the desert a Paradice. And Bernard saith: With whome God is, he is neuer Bern. in his Epist. lesse alone, then when he is alone: for then he freelye enioyeth his heartes ioy, then hee is his owne man to enioy God in himselfe, & himself in God, &c. what Paradice can be more pleasaunt in this pilgrimage, then that which God promiseth to a soule deuout, and attendinge vppon him, when as hee sayth: Beholde, I will allure 
               Os

               her, & bring her into the wildernes, & speake friendly vnto her, & I wil giue her her vineyardes from thence, & the valley of Achor for the doore of hope, & she shall sing there as in the dayes of her youth, & as in the day when she came vp out of the land of Egipt.
            These be the songs & himmes of a soule ascēding from ye
                earth, and going out of this world, and by little and little, more and more encreasing in the loue and knowledge of her Creator. These be the dayes of her spirituall youth, when the loue is stronger & more vehement. These songs are sung in the wildernes, and in the valey of Achor, which is of trouble: by which is vnderstood the humility of contrition: for there the way vnto hope is first opened vnto the soule, and there she receiueth remission of sinnes: there she prayseth

and lawdeth her Creator, because with so mighty an arme, and with so mercifull an hand, he hath deliuered and freed her from this world. These be the wages, which God giueth vnto his friendes for the troubles and turmoyles of the wildernes.
            This solitarines is not onely profitable and conducent vnto deuotion, but also vnto all other vertues: for it cutteth off all the occasions of sin, which are wont to happen in the assemblyes and companies of men: but especiallye the occasions of falling in the tongue, which almost are infinite. Therefore Seneca giueth very good counsaile, that solitarines is to be sought for of him, that would keep his innocencye.
         
         
            
            NINTHLY, APPOINted times, & certaine sette howres, do very much make to the encreasing of Deuotion. CHAP. XII.
            
            ALl which before hath bene spoken, doth especiallye belong to the keeping of the heart, which not onely is the mother of pure prayer, but also of all other vertues. But that which hereafter we are to speake, doth chiefly belong to stirre vp deuotion. And first it is required, that a deuoute Certaine set times of prayer are be appointed. man prescribe vnto himselfe appoynted times, and certaine sette howers to praye in, that alone he may speake with God alone. The Prophet Daniel did this, of whom Dan. 6. the Scripture speaketh, that the windowes of his chamber beeing

opened towards Ierusalem, three times a day he bended his knees, & worshiped before his God. The same did Dauid, who in ye
                nights lifted vp his handes, and in the morninges did meditate of the Lord, as hee testifieth of himselfe in many places of his Psalmes: in one of which he sayth, that seauen tymes a day hee did prayse the Lord.
            
               Luke writeth of the faythfull in the prymatiue Church, that dayly with one accorde they continued in the Temple in prayer, and at night returned home, where they receiued the holy Communyon together, wyth gladnesse and simplycity of hart, being full of the comfort of the holy Ghost. Of those, who succeeded these, Plyn
                     •…
                  e thus Pliny in an Epist. to Traian. wryteth to Traian the Emperour▪
            
            
               
The Christians are a people innocent, voyde of vice and offence, neyther haue they any other fault then that they gather themselues together in assemblies before day, where they sing prayses & hymmes, in the honor of a certaine man called Christ, who was crucified in Palestina. What need we many words? it is written of all the Saints, that they passed the greater part of the night in spirituall exercises, prayers, contemplations and readings, fulfilling that of Dauid: In the night lift vp your hands to the Sanctuary, 
               Psal. 145. 
               and praise the Lord. But farre aboue all these is that example of our Sauiour, of whome the Euangelistes writ, that in the day time he was busied in working miracles, & in preaching the kingdome of God: but in the night perseuered in watching & prayer.
            
               
This belongeth not onely and solely to the clergy, as some vainly babble: but to all them, that desire to enioy God, and to come to the perfection of life. Saint Hierome in an Epis. to Celantia. Cap. 6. 
               Hierome exhorteth a certaine noble Woman called Celantia to doe thus, in these words: So take care for thy house and family, that thou mayst bestowe some time and leasure vpon thy soule. Choose for thy selfe some fitte place, somewhat remooued from the noyse of thy family, into which, as into a hauen thou mayst betake thy selfe out of the great storme and tempest of thy cares, and there appease and asswage by the tranquility of thy secret closset, the waues and billowes of cogitations raysed by outward troubles.
            Let there bee so much studye of Diuine reading, so many entercourses

of prayers, so firme and solide cogitation of future thinges, that by this leasure thou mayst recompence all the businesses of the other time.
            Neyther doe wee saye this to that ende, that wee may withdrawe thee from thine affayres, but wee doe it, th
                  •…
               t there thou mayst learne, and there medytate, what an one thou oughtest to shew thy selfe in thine affaires. This saith he.
            But if thou shalt aske mee, how often in a day thou shalt turne thee vnto this studie, and take this taske in hand; I cannot prescribe a certaine rule vnto thee: for all men haue not the same occasions of leysure and readines.
            Yet remember that in the law the twoo dayly Sacrifices, the The two daily Sacrifices. morning Sacrifice and the euening,

are very often commended, which euery Christian ought spiritually to offer, withdrawing himselfe at those times from externall thinges, that hee may attend vppon Celestiall matters.
            That as twice in a day we refreshe our bodies, that is, at dinner, and at supper: so also twice a day wee giue the due nourishment vnto our soules: seeing that it is of no lesser dignity, then the body: neyther is the meate lesse necessary for the soule, then for the bodye, yea it is much more necessary.
            The ordinarye nourishment is necessary for the body, because the naturall heate doth alwayes consume and waste the substance of man: and therefore it is necessary, that it be repayred on the one side, as it is decayed

on the other: so the soule hath in it a pestilent heate (which is the concupiscence, and euill inclination of our appetites) consuming and wasting all good: therefore it is needfull that that bee dayly repayred by Deuotion, which is wasted and decayed by that hurtfull and pestilentiall heate.
            We must also know, that mans nature by sinne is corrupt, inclynable to all earthly things, which by the weight doth drawe man vnto it, as the Wiseman saith: A corruptible body is heauy vnto the soule, and the earthly mansion keepeth 
               Wisedo. 9. 
               downe the minde that is full of cares.
            
            Therefore as they that haue the charge and keeping of a A Simily. Clocke, are wont euerye day twice to winde vp the plummets, for they of their owne proper motion doe by little and

little descende, and drawe towardes the ground: so they that desire to keep their soules vpright, and well ordered, ought at the least twice a day to erect and lift vp her weightes: seeing that our wretched nature is so inclynable to thinges below, that it alwayes endeuoureth to sinke downwards.
            Ah howe euidently doe they dayly feele this that pray. How often doth a man (his morning prayer being ended) thinke that the weight and poyse of his clock is lifted vp into heauen, and that hee hath all his intention and will fixed aboue: so that hee seemeth not to vouchsafe to beholde these earthly thinges: and a little after, when hee shall turne himselfe to his dayly affayres, and beginneth to traffique with men, when as the

euening commeth, he shall perceiue the plummet euen to haue fallen and lye vpon the earth: that is, hee shall finde his spirit so sunke downe into the earth, & inclyned to earthly thinges, as though it had neuer beene lifted nor wound vp. He therefore that wold alwayes haue the clocke of his life well ordred & gouerned, hee must alwaies haue a speciall regarde to winde vp the plummets and wightes of it. Yet notwithstanding so, that no violence be offered.
            They that haue not conueniency nor leasure to pray twice in a day, let them endeuour themselues Those that cannot long pray must haue recourse to those darting prayers, spoken of before. to pray once. But if they cannot doe this, I knowe not what counsell to giue them else, then that they haue recourse to those short praiers, which wehaue spoken of before, which may bee

intermingled with all kinde of our occupations and businesses. For I remember that I haue seene good and godly spirits supported by the vse and helpe of these, whose condition, manner of liuing, and infirmity did not permit them to haue any longer praiers: albeit these kinde of prayers cannot long hold out, if the foundation of other profounder and longer prayers be wanting.
         
         
            THE TENTH THING that doth kindle Deuotion, is the continuing and perseuering in good exercises. CHAP. XIII.
            BVt that this exercise may bee profitable, we must note, that in this place duration and long perseuerance is required in it.

For there are many found, that neuer make an end of that they once began, but alwayes weaue & vnweaue (as they say) the web of Penelope.
            These propounding this way vnto themselues, doe sticke to it two or three dayes, and foorthwith are tyred and doe forget it, so that when they returne to that they began, they are so cold, and so far remoued from themselues, as if they had neuer begun, or as if they had neuer heard, no not by a dreame, what praier is. Therfore they betake themselues to new purposes, and they choose againe vnto themselues a new exercise, and when they haue somewhat proceeded, eyther through wearines, or because they think they haue taken paines enough, they returne vnto rest, & forget their labour.
            
               
And so they spend their whole life in building & pulling downe, and in rowling (as it is said) the stone of Sisyphus, which when they haue rowled to the midst of the mountaine, suddenly it falleth downe, and so in beginning and in rowling they consume their whole age.
            Such are they that vpon euery small and light occasion dooe forsake their prayers and laudable exercises: to whome it often happeneth (as I haue tryed by experience) that whilst they purpose to intermit their prayers onely for two or three dayes, they intermit it all their life long.
            For when they would returne vnto it, they finde no gate nor entrance vnto it: and the way vnto it becomes dayly more difficult vnto them: therefore

they stay without, and returne to the custome of their auncient life. For a man without prayer, and without spirituall exercise, is as Sampson without his hayre: who forth with loseth his strēgth, and remaineth feeble and weake, like other men, and is greatly endangered, least he fall into the hands of his enimies.
            Therefore it behooueth vs to bee firme and stable in this exercise: for it is certaine, that of the constancye and ordering of it, dependeth all our life.
            Contemplate in the celestiall bodies, howe great a constancy and firmenes they keep in theyr course & motion, which they neuer chāged since the time, wherin they were created. For seeing that they weretobe ye causes on which the administration of the whole world was to depēd, it was needfull

that in them there should be great constancye, that the world might bee alwayes well ordered and disposed. So seeing that of this spirituall exercise, the whole order and processe of a spirituall life dependeth, as experience teacheth, it is meete and requisite, that hee that would haue his life well ordered and disposed, that hee haue the causes well ordered and disposed, on which the ordering of it dependeth.
            See with what constancye the Prophet Daniel did obserue these three times of prayer, when neither by the feare of death, nor by the gayn-sayinge of hys enimyes, hee could bee brought from hys accustomed order: so that hee chose rather to endaunger his life, then to breake off his set course of prayer.
            
               
So also a deuout man ought so firmely to purpose with himselfe, and inuiolablye decree, to attend and waite vpon God at his accustomed howres, that he would rather faile in al other his businesses, which concerne not God, then in this one so greatly commended of GOD. Imi tate the naturall prudency of Serpēts, who hiding A Simily. their heads, do yeilde their whole bodyes to the smiter, that that being lost, which is of lesse weight, they may preserue that which is of greater valew. Imitate the Gen. 31, & 33. wisdome of the most holy Patriarke Iacob, who returning out of Mesopotamia, and beeing to receiue & entertaine his brother, whome he greatly feared, sent before his sheep, oxen, and camels, with all his substance: after them he placed both his mayds & their children: after them Leah & her

children: but Rachel & Ioseph, as most precious & estimable treasures he ordred in the last & safest place: signifying that he had rather hazard all the rest, then those two, whom he so much esteemed. Tell me O thou seruant of God, what hast thou in ye world, which thou art so much to regard, as this Rachel & Ioseph? What is Rachel, but a contemplatiue life? what is Ioseph, but the spirituall sonne, which is borne of her, which is innocency & purity of life? wherfore that treasure is more to be esteemed, then the losse of anye temporal thing: so that thou must make account rather to lose these, then fayle in the other. Therfore my brother, hap what wil, alwaies keepe with thee thy Rachel & thy Ioseph. Do not imitate them, who haue prayers, exercises, & spirituall thinges for a cloake & colour

of their negligence, who when they are to doe, or lose any thing, they alwayes expose the spirituall thing to the daunger, that they maye keepe and defend the temporall.
            I knew a godly religious woman, who as often as she heard the sound of the howre, in which she was wont to pray, at that very same time (as it is also reported of those holy Fathers of Egipt) all An example of excellent Deuotion. other thinges beeing set aparte without delay she betooke her to her exercise. When she conferred with an other godly woman, with whose conuersatiō she was greatly delighted forth-with after shee heard the stroke of the passed houre, she departed from her, abruptly breaking off her speech, saing: If to day I shall omit mine ordinarye taske for this cause, to morowe I shall omit it for an other,

(for euery day bringeth his hinderance) and stil so proceding, I shall commit a thousand errors. At another time the same deuout woman beeing with me, the like circumstances fell out, where at her departure frō me she shewed no token of vanitye, but of great edifying: so that scarcely three times in a yeere she fayleth in this her moste holye exercise. I haue brought this example for the benefite of those that be negligent, but I dare not remēber the fruite, that she obtained by this perseuerance. For these times and dayes wherein we liue, are so enuious, and so full of iniquitye, that they will not abide that the vertues of the liuing should be published: as the examples of many Saintes do testifye.
            There is not any thing in ye world, ye more speedily bringeth a man to

the height and top of perfection, then this continuance and perseuerance, as well in the exercises of Prayer, as in the diligence and order of his life: for a traueller that euery day goeth forward a little, A Simily. if he perseuer and continue in his progresse, soone commeth to the end of his iorney. but if he faile and faint in it, and a little after begin his voyage a new, consumeth all his life in it neither euer cometh to the end of his iorney.
            But if at any time a casualty happen, which cannot be refused in this life, so that thou doest stumble and fal, and through weaknes doest faint, doe not discourage thy selfe, nor cast away thy hope: but albeit thou fall a thousand times in a day, ryse againe and be conuerted a thousand times in a day: & in what place thy threed was broken, knit it together aagaine,

doe not goe backe to the beginning, for if thou doest, thou shalt disturbe all thy worke & labour.
            Neyther onely is constancy The exercises are not to be changed. needfull in the very exercises thē
               selues: but also in the manner of them. For there be some, that doe not fayle in their dayly taske: but daily change their intent and purpose: to day they goe this way, and to morrow that: and thus being vnstable and vnstayed in theyr affections, they remayne constant in nothing.
            Sometimes they begin of the Passion: a little after they leaue it and take vnto themselues another Meditation, and another exercise.
            Sometimes they clymbe vp into heauen, relinquish sacred humanytie, and ascend to the highnes & sublimity of Diuinity. Some leaue all these, and begin of the

memory of theyr sinnes: so that they neuer prosecute the thing taken in hand, and neuer come to the end of their dyet, to which without doubte they had sooner come, if they had perseuered in the same way, albeit it was not so direct nor compendious.
            It happeneth vnto these as to hunting dogges, who followe A Simily. two Hares, and take neyther: the tree hardlye encreaseth, that is often trans-planted: and the wound is slowlyer healed, when the medicines are often or dayly altered.
            Seeing that there are manye and sundrye wayes, by which man goeth vnto GOD, and manye manners of considerations, by which the spirite is lifted vp vnto him: let euerye one ponder with him selfe, which is the best fitting for his purpose, and

let him entertayne and followe that: for that is the best course that he can take.
            But let him beware that hee dooth not fall into the errour of manye, who when they haue found God in some one exercise, they deny that there is any other way, but that alone: which is nothing els, but to denye that there be moe wayes, by which we goe vnto GOD: when as the holye Ghost, who is our leader and Captayne, dooth leade euerye one by his owne way, which hee seeth to be most commodious and conuenient for him.
         
         
            
            THE ELEVENTH thing that encreaseth Deuotion, is the time, and such like circumstances. CHAP. XIIII.
            
            MVch doe they auayle, which before wee haue spoken of, as the time, the place, the disposition, and the corporall fashion & forme of him, that prayeth, with other circumstances, euery one of which are as prickes to stirre vp deuotion, especially in nouices & yong beginners: who as they are not altogether spirituall, so haue they greater need of the help and ayde of corporal things, that their heartes may bee lifted vp vnto God.
            The fittest and most conuenient time of Prayer is mid-night,

as Bernarde saith in a certaine Sermon: Bern. in his 30. Sermon vpon the Cant. the resting and withdrawing time, saith he, is the aptest and fittest, but especially when as the night sleepe doth bring dead and deep silence, then the Prayer is powred foorth more freely and more purely: Arise in the night, saith the Prophet, in the beginning 
               Lament. 2. 
               of the Watches powre out thy heart like water before the face of the lord. How safely thy prayer ascendeth in the night, God alone being thy iudge, & his holy Angell thy witnes, who vndertaketh to present 
                  •…
               t vppon the high altar? How acceptable & welcome is it, hauing the pleasing tincture of ruddye shamefastnes?
            How quiet and peaceable being disturbed with no clamour, nor noyse: to be breefe, how pure and sincere, being soyled with no dust of earthly carefulnes: being

tempted with no praise or flattery of the beholder? For this cause therfore the spouse no lesse shamfastly, then warilye sought for the secret couerture both of the bed, & of the night: to pray, that is, desiring to finde her loue. This saith Saint Bernard.
            
            They that cannot rise at midnight, let them endeuour to rise a little before the rising of the Sun, as the Wise man admonisheth: We ought, saith hee, to preuent the 
               Wisedo. 16 
               Sun-rising to giue thanks vnto thee, and to salute thee before the day spring. In the morning the Childrē of Israell gathered that delicate Manna, hauing in it that most exellent taste of sweetnes. Dau

                  le. 30. 
               for the Lord, who made him

& he pomreth foorth his prayers in the sight of the highest. In the morning in the falling of the heauenly dewe, the grace of the holy Ghost descendeth also into their heartes, who meditate on GOD, by the which they may bee defended frō the heat of the Sun, and from the plague that destroyeth at noone day. To be briefe, this time is so conuenient to attend vppon the Lord, that the Wise man beeing delighted with this oportuniye, said: He riseth well in the morning that seeketh for good thinges, or the Prou. 2. chiefest good. For this time of all times in the day, is the conuenientest and fittest to talke with God, and to deale in the busines of our saluation: for then all the powers & faculties of our foules are more cheerefull & ready, & better prepared for this dutye. Our sight is not so wandring, our stomacke

empty, our head refreshed with sleepe, the time quiet, and the heart free and fasting from the cogitations and businesse of the daye.
            A short supper, and a hard bed are good meanes for early rising: Good meanes for early rising. they make the sleepe shorter, & the time of prayer longer. But a large supper, and a soft bed work the contrary: for when much is to be digested, much sleepe must be had, and the softer the bed is, the more vnwillingly it is left.
            But when as eyther for age, or for infirmity, or for presence of friends, or society, a man cannot rise at that houre, yet let him not omit to watch a little, and to meditate in his heart of those things that belong vnto God. For it is not absurde in such necessitye to make an oratory of thy bedde, as that holy Prophet did, who said:

               I cause my bedde euerye night to 
               Psal. 6. 
               swimme, and water my couch with teares. For as it is not inconuenient to sit praying, when as the weakenesse of the body will not suffer any other way: so neyther is it absurd to lie and pray in bed, when as necessity, or vrgent reason doeth constraine it. Let thy soule bee bended and prostrated before the presence of God: and let thy body haue that forme and fashion, it maye haue: for that the best composition of the body, which doth not hinder deuotion. If it may be, let the man that is weake be halfe cloathed, that he may sit in his bed, if so be his weakenesse be so great that hee cannot rise.
            It verye much helpeth morning prayer, if a man before hee goe to sleepe doth somewhat giue himselfe to prayer:

for in the morning hee shall finde in his heart the fruite of that seed, which hee sowed the night before. Therefore that man doth A Simily. very well, that alwaies goeth to bed with some holie Meditation in his minde, as hee that at night couereth the coales in the ashes, that in the morning when he ryseth, he may the more easily make a fire. And to preserue this fire the better, it is profitable, that as oftē at thou awakest in the night, foorth with to lift vp thine heart to God, saying. Glory bee to the Father, &c. or some such like verse; for this shal very much help not onely to this which we speak of, but also to driue away vayne fansies & wantō thoughts which are sent of the deuill: for at this time he is wont to bee more busie about a man, then at other times.
            
               
Wherefore Saint Hierome saith, that euen to the holy and sanctified bed of Dauid, which euerye night hee had wont to water with his teares, the deuill had accesse with all the pompe of his pleasure's
            In the morning, when wee a wake, As soone as we awake we must thinke of God. as soone as wee open our eyes, let our heartes bee powred foorth in the remembraunce of God, before any other cogitation doth possesse them: for then the soule is so tender, and so well disposed, that it presently assumeth the first thought, which is offered: and apprehendeth it so firmly, that it can hardly be remooued from it, or receiue any other.
            Therefore it is necessary, that wee haue recourse to the good seede, least the euill seede possesse the ground of our heartes. Of such weight is this counsell, that

the busines of the whole day dependeth of this moment. For thi

               rostrated thēselus vpō the erth, with admirable deuotiō worshipping the Lord: & forthwith with

great alacraty they raysed vp thē
               selues, that it seemed not so much the easing and refreshing of their bodies, as the adoration and reuerence of the diuine Maiestie.
            According to these examples, he that prayeth, ought somtimes to vse such like iestures and ceremonies, that his heart with greater facility may bee lifted vp to God: seeing that we see that no meane fruites are deriued from it.
            It is good for a man sometimes with lowly humility of spirit to prostrate himself vpon the earth, adoring with all the blessed spirits that infinite and incomprehensible Maiestie, who casting downe their crownes before the throne of God and the Lambe: giue glory vnto God, & acknowledge Apoc. 4. that whatsoeuer they haue, they receiued it from him.
            
               
When we pray we ought also to Cerimonies in prayer are not to be reprehended. lift vp our eyes towards heauen, which ceremonies, seeing that our Sauiour himself so oftentimes vsed, they ought not to be reprehended, but obserued, as examples left vnto vs of our Master & Teacher. For albeit God is present euery where, yet heauen is his proper place, in which hee doth those works, which he doth not in other places.
            Heere the reader is to be admonished, that it is not alwaies necessary to pray with bēded knees, seeing that by this meanes our deuotion is often times hindred, by reason of the griese and weaknes of the body. True it is, yt it is good to suffer some affliction in praier, seeing that the Lord in his sacrifice, suffered so great thinges for our sins: yet this is not the chiefest fruite of praier, for in comparison

of the light, and sweetnes of vertue, which god bestoweth in praier, the griefe of the body, and corporall exercise seeme very small. Therfore in the time of praier let the composition and ordering of thy body be such, as may be both for thy health, and that thy soule may be quiet, and fixed vpon god alone; especially when the time of thy praier is longer, that is, of two or three houres, (as it is the custome of some) seeing that few are found, who are able to bear so long paine and griefe, without diminishing and abating of deuotion, which is especially required in this exercise.
            I know & confesse that al these things are not of any such speciall consequēt: yet they are cōducent & auailable to our purposed end. For euen as rhetoritiās, that wold cōpile & frame a perfect oration,

are not content with teaching the matters themselues alone, which are the very strength and sinewes of the oration: but also they vse other maner of variations, which are not of the substance of the oration: as apt structure & composition, fit concourse and conioyning of vowels and consonants, tropes, schemes, figures, &c. For these make the oration perfect & absolute: so also we frame & form here an other oration celestiall & heauenly, which we are to declaime in the presence of the deuine maiesty: it is meete therfore, that we should omitte nothing, whether it be much, or litle, which is conducent vnto the essence and perfection of it: especially seeing that there is nothing in this kinde of discipline, which ought to bee called small or little.
         
         
            
            THE TWELVETH thing, which stirreth vp Deuotion, is corporall austeritie, or exercise. CHAP. XV.
            
            BEside al those things, which hetherto we haue spoken of, afflictions and corporall troubles and greeuances are profitable to excite and stirre vp Deuotion: as are fasting, discipline, vnsoft and rowgh apparrel, watching, a hard bed, and sober and slender dyet. Frist because such exercises are fomentations and nourishers of Prayer and Deuotion: Secondly because they are pillers and bases, on which they leane: Thirdly, for the common rule: which is, that A common rule. God doth bestow his grace vpon euery one, as he is fit to receiue it.

For none can deny, but that he is more fit and better disposed, who prepareth himselfe together both in spirit & body, then he that onely prepareth himselfe in spirit.
            We must here know, that there are two wayes of preparing and Two waies of preparing our solues vnto prayer. disposing our selues to receiue grace: one false, the oeher true. The false way is, when as a man onely in word, and with a luke warm desire doth seeke for God, without the true & internal sighing and sobbing of the soule. And this is the reason, why many doe seeke for God, & do not find him: do aske, & not receiue. And in this slender & cold desire they alwaies liue & neuer finde God: because they seeke him not with all their heart, as he ought to be sought of them, who desire to find him, according to that of the Prophet. Ye 
               Ier. 29. 
               shall seeke me, and finde me, because

ye shall seeke me with all your heart. This is the second way of disposing & preparing our selues, which here the Prophet noteth: that is, whē we seek for God, with a true & in ward desire, & with labor & affliction of heart. Of which God speaketh by his Prophet Ioel, saying. Turn you vnto me with al your hart, & with fasting, & with weeping, 
               Rael. 2. 
               & with mourning: & rent your hart, & not yourclothes, & turn vnto the lord your god. In which place we are to note, yt as the euil which outwardly appeareth not, either is not seen, or is not an euill indeed, or very small: so ye inward afflictiō of the spirit, except it outwardly break forth, & doth also afflict the body, is ether feined, or very smal. But that which doth so mightily afflict ye spirit, that it doth also afflict the body, that istruly & indeed worthy to be called afflictiō, & of this the Prophet speaketh.
            
               
He that seeketh god with such an affectiō, let him assure himselfe, yt God wil not hide himself frō him, but will be found of him. So the Niniuites sought him, when they fasted, mourned, & were cloathed Iomas. 3. with sackcloth: wherefore at the length they foūd him. So the Prophet Daniel sought him, as he testifieth of himself:
            
               At the same time, saith he, I 
               Dani. 10. 
               Daniell was in heauinesse for three weekes of daies, I eate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh, in my mouth, neither did I 
                     〈◊〉
                   myselfe at al, till three weekes of daies were fulfilled. Which time being finished, hee faith that an Angel appeared vnto him in a terrible shape, whome in the same place, he describeth among other things saying: Feare not daniel: for from the first day that thou diddest set thine heart to vnderstand

& to humble thyself before thy God, thy woordes were heard, & I am come for thy words. See how plainly in this place the Scriture testifieth, what deuout prayer can do, when as corporal affliction is ioyned vnto it.
            We read of that holy Euangelicall sinner, that being drowned Ioh. 20. as it were with teares, she sought the Lord in the Sepulcher: wherfore she receiued comfort before all others, because before al other, shee sought the Lord with great affection.
            But what do I speake of teares so godlye, when as the sackcloth of peruerse and wicked King Achab, could so moue the diuine eyes & brest, as to reuoke, or at the least to defer the sentence denounced against him & his house?
            To be briefe, as often as the Scripture remembreth that the

children of Israel mourned, fasted, & cryed vnto God, it addeth, that they were heard, & deliuered frō the danger they were in: wherby it most manifestly apeereth, that these are great helps to find God. Wherupon a Schoole man saith, that almost no grace descendeth into the soule of man except it 
                  •…
               e by prayer, affliction, & corporall tribulation.
            There are many kindes of afflictions Whence the griefe of the soule in prayer aryseth. & austerenes of life, most acceptable vnto God & most cō
               uenient to obtain grace by, which take their original from the great griefe, which the soule cōceiueth, because she hath offended so high & exellēt a goodnes, & also from the impatient longing desire of the soule. These teares & afflictions, which are deriued from charity & humility are very acceptable vnto GOD, as testifieth the

Prophet, who saith. The dead that 
               
                  
                     •…
                  ar. 2. 
               are in the graues, & whose soules are out of their bodies, giue vnto the lord neither praise nor righteousnes: but the soule that is vexed for the greatnes of sinne, & he that goeth crookedly, & weake, & the eyes that faile, and the hungry soule will giue thee praise and righteousnes, O Lord.
            
            The pittifull and fatherly heart of god doth not long suffer the soule afflicted with the loue and longing for of her spouse, to be disconsolate, and destitute of comfort: but doth help her, & minister cō
               solation vnto her. When as the mother seeth her child weeping, & desiring gugawes with teares, her hart cannot brooke that the request of her child shuld be long deferred, and that he should be hurt with weeping; but foorthwith she giueth him that hee desireth, and for which hee wept.

What then will he doe, that offered himselfe for Israell with farre greater affection, then that of the mother, who saith: Though the 
               Esay. 49. 
               mother forget her child of her womb yet will I not forget thee. What wil he doe, if hee doth not open the breast of his grace, and the bosome of his mercy, and fill vs full, who saith: Yee shall sucke at my 
               Esay. 66. 
               breasts, ye shalbe born vpon mysides, and be ioyfull vpon my knees. After this manner they must seeke for the diuine grace: who would find it: and if they thus seeke for it, they shall be sure to finde it. For Salomon doth often promisse this in his Prouerbs: as when he saith, Pro. 8. thr
                  •…
                they at the length shall finde Wisedome, who dayly watch at her gates, and giue attendaunce at the poastes of her doores: insinuating by thys manner of speaking, that he that wold

finde her, must seek her as she is to be sought: but he seeketh her as she is to be sought, who seeketh her, not onely with the desire of spirit, but also with the labour & affection of the bodye. And here we must be circumspect and wary that all these things be done with wisedome & discretion.

            OF THE FIRST IMpediment & hindrance of Deuotion, which is sin.
            THe cheefe & principall impediment, which now wee will speake of, is sinne: neither onely that which ye world is commonly ashamed of, as being gros
                  •…
                and heynous, but also that, whic
                  •…
                for the most part, men make 
                  〈◊〉
                conscience nor scruple to cōmit
                  •…
                as esteeming it small & of no reckoning.
            Of the first we will not speak
                  •…
                of in this place, because no ma
                  •…
                doubteth, but that it hindreth a
                  •…
                good in the soule: but wee w
                  •…
                onely intreate of the second, because it is the propertie of thes
                  •…
                sinnes also to coole charitye, an
                  •…
                therefore to extinguish the he
                  •…
                of Deuotion.
            
               
Therfore it is requisite and behooueful that a deuout man make continuall war with this kinde of sinnes, which albeit they seeme small, yet they are not to bee accounted so, seeing that God hath forbidden them.
            For as it is very well saide of Saint Hierome, we must not onely looke what is commaunded, but also who it is, that commaundeth, that is, God; who as vndoubtedly hee is not smal, so hath he giuen no small commaundement, albeit there is a difference betweene the commaundementes: seeing also we are not ignorant, that in the day of iudgement wee must render 
                  〈◊〉
                reason of euery idle word. For 
                  •…
               e that feareth God, neglecteth 
                  •…
               ot any thing, although it bee 
                  •…
               mall.
            Furthermore wee muste haue

a regard, that there ought be great purity in the soule, into which God powreth the most precious oyntment of Deuotion: for a precious stone is not inclosed or set in earth, but in golde: neyther doth God put his Soueraygne balme, but into a pure soule, cleane and free from filthy and enormous corruption. Therefore it is necessary that a man haue alwaies in his hand a rāging siffe, or a fine boulter, that he may wel sift and boult ouer all his actions, and diligently view, with what intente, and howe hee doth a
                  •…
                thinges, that in all thinges h
                  •…
                may bee pure from vanity an
                  •…
                sinne.
            Theyr opinion is diligently to bee eschewed and auoyded who are wont to saye: th
                  •…
                sinne is not vnpardonable n
                  •…
               
               
haynous, therefore it is of no great moment, if it be committed.
            What woman will saye to her husband; I will not bee an euill wife vnto thee, neyther will I pollute thy marryage bed: yet in other thinges I will doe, as pleaseth mee, although I shall knowe that I shall displease thee?
            Who would or could dwell with such a woman? Such surelye are they, that of great and vast sinnes make a conscience, but of little make no reckoning Ecclesiasticus sayth, that he that maketh small account of little thinges, shall fall by little and little.
            
            As a liuing body, not onelye feareth death, but also Feauers, Woundes, yea and 
                  •…
               he Itche, and Scabbes also

albeit they bee small: so a soule, that liueth in grace, not onely feareth and abhorreth grosse and haynous sinnes, but also those, that seeme of lesser moment & doe make way and entrance to those that be grosser.
            Therefore hee that seriously studieth and endeuoureth to attaine deuotion, he must auoyde & eschew all sin, as well that which seemeth lesse, as that which is greater, that hee may lift vp pure handes in prayer, and that the feruour of Charity may alwaies liue in him.
         
         
            
            THE SECOND IMPEdiment is the remorse of conscience. CHAP. XVIII.
            
            AN impediment contrary to the former is too much scrupulositie and too much griefe, & anxiety of hart, which some doe conceiue by reason of the sinne, they haue fallen into. For this oftentimes doth bring more harme then the sinne it selfe. For seeing that it is the property of sinne to bring remorse and sting of conscience, there are some so subiect to this euill, that their hearts are filled with exceeding bitternes, heauines and griefe; neyther can they nowe enioy that Diuine sweetnesse and quiet, which Prayer requireth.
            
               
Furthermore seeing that sinne is like vnto deadly poyson, which speedyly pearceth the heart, killeth the spirites, and bringeth death, there be some, that falling into a sinne, are foorthwith so vanquished in minde that they lose all theyr inward strength, which before they had attained to worke well.
            For as there is nothing, which doth more stirre vs vp vnto good, then the vigour and strength of the heart, so there is nothing, which doth more extinguish heate and feruour in vs, then the weakenes and fainting of the same.
            For this cause the Holy Fathers in the wildernesse were wont in times past to admonish their Disciples, that they should alwayes stand armed with this courage and fortitude of minde,

for by this meanes a man as it were leaning on a strong staffe, is prepared and readye to all thinges which are to bee done: but to him that faynteth or casteth downe his courage, the contrary hapneth.
            Wherefore it is the common opinion of many, that moe, receiue greater harme of an indiscreete estimation of sinne, then of the sinne it selfe.
            This indiscreete remorse of Whence too much remorse of conscience ariseth. conscience doth somtimes spring and arise from faint-hartednes: & sometimes from a certaine secret pride, which closely perswadeth a man that he is some body, and therfore ye he ought not to fal into such a defect: to whom humility prōpteth the cōtrary: to whom it is no maruel if there be slidings into many defectes; for humility hath alwaies set before her eyes her

owne weaknes, and doth meditate on it.
            This faint-hartednes also is sometimes deriued from hence, that a man doth not knowe the grace and efficacy of the redemption of Christ, nor the vertue of the medicine, which he hath left vnto vs in his death and passion for the healing of this defect, and remedying of this feare.
            Therefore let this be the first The first remedy against too much scrupulositie. remedye against this euill, to knowe the Lorde, and the price, and vertue of his merits, least we at anytime cast away the hope of the Diuine mercy, whether it be in great sinnes, or in little.
            Saint Iohn doth cherish this hope, when he saith: My babes 
               1. Ioh. 2. 
               these thinges write I vnto you, that ye sinne not: and if any man sinne, wee haue an Aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christe

the Iust. And he is the reconcilation for our sinnes: and not for ours onely, but also for the sinnes of the whole world.
            
            What diffidence and distrust can then hurte or annoye thee, being shadowed with these winges, and couered with the merites of so greate an intercessour? All the sinnes in the worlde, if they bee compared with the merites of Christ, are nothing else, but a little light chaffe cast into the fire.
            Why then dooest thou discourage thy selfe, seeing that such satisfaction, and so great merits are so liberally and freely offered vnto thee?
            Thou wilt saye, because I offende euery day, and euerye 
                  •…
               ower, neyther doe I at anye time amend my selfe. Tell me,

               f Christ should dayly suffer for

thy sinnes, which thou daylye committest; is there any reason that thou shouldst dispaire? Thou wilt aunsweare, Noe: Therefore assuredly perswade thy selfe, that that death so long agoe performed is no lesse profitable, theu if it weredayly offered: for the Apostle sayth, that that high Priest by one oblation, Heb. 10. whych hee offered vppon the Crosse, hath clensed and sanctified vs for euer: he hath left that in hys Sacrifice for vs, that it may bee a perpetuall medicine and treasure vnto vs.
            Thou wilt obiect againe, and say: I offend and sinne dayly, albeit God dayly powreth and heapeth his blessings and graces vppon mee, therefore I cannot but distrust, and fall from hope.
            
               
I tell thee in veritye and truth, that as nothing can bee found that doth more manyfest the malitiousnesse of man, then that manner of multiplying sinnes, when as the Diuine benefittes are incessantly powred vpō him: so also there is nothing founde, wherein the greatnesse of the Diuine goodnesse doth more appeare, then in this, that God doth without ceasing showre downe his benefittes vpon him, that blusheth not without ceasing to offend him.
            Our sinnes sayth Paule, doe manyfest the Diuine goodnesse: for neyther in Heauen, nor in Earth, nor among Fowles, nor Fishes, neyther in Hearbes nor Flowers, doth the Noblenesse

               entlye shyne, then in thys,

that hee suffereth and forgiueth By the multitude of sinnes the goodnes of God is knowen. sinnes.
            For if wisely and prudentlye thou knowest to vse the daungerous and pernitious taste of sinne, as some poyson, thou mayest make a medicine of it, by ascending vp from it to that supreme goodnes, which with so great benignity suffereth thy sinnes, albeit they are so many, and so great, that thou who committest them art not able to beare them, and although thou art wearye in bearing them, yet God is not wearye in pardoninge of them.
            Therefore let the bitter pilles bee gilded ouer with the honnye of this consideration, that the too much bitternesse which is in them, may not bee tasted. Which if it be done, thou shalt manytimes tast greater sweetnes

by the consideration of this goodnes, then bitternesse by the meditation of thine owne wickednes. Wherefore in this case thou must doe that, which a faithfull seruant doth, who albeit he be rude and negligent, yet he hath a good and gratious Lorde, if he commit a fault; on the one side he beginneth to tremble for his offence, but on the other side he remembreth that hee hath a Lord full of clemency, who so often hath pardoned his offences, thereupon he hopeth, that with the same clemency he was woont to forgiue his former trespasses, he will also now winke at these present. Therfore when he doth call to minde these things, he turneth the feare and griefe, which the memorye of his sins brought forth, into ioy, which he feeleth by the consideration of the goodnes of his Lord.

Thy consideration ought to bee like this, as often as too much sorrow for thy sinnes doth afflict and oppresse thee: for thou doing this, of poyson thou shalt make for thy selfe a preseruatiue and a remedy against poyson, and thou shalt pul out the eies of thine enemy, and kill him with his own sword, and thou shalt take occasion of greater strength and courage of those same things, which were woont to bee the causes of greater feare and trembling. If thou draw thy water thorow this channell, thou shalt water two excellent vertues, charity and humility: whilest of the sinne, into which thou diddest fall, thou takest occasion to humble thy selfe, more manifestly acknowledging thine owne misery: and to loue him with a more ardent loue, vpon whose goodnes thou

doest so greatly trust, & certainly perswadest thy selfe that he will pardon and forgiue thy sins.
            Furthermore we are to know, Two kind
                     •…
                   of sinnes. that there are two kinde of sins, greatly differing betweene themselues. For there be some that sin vnwillinglye against their purpose and deliberation, of very weakenesse or negligence; or of the inclination, and euill habit, which remaineth in the soule, oftentimes drawing a man vnto euil, before he be aware. Others are of a larger conscience, who if they abstaine from grosse and hainous sinnes, they make no conscience of those that be smaller, neyther haue they any purpose to auoyde thē: but they will eat, drink, walk and talke, that they maye spend and passe away the time, by which things they consume much time vnprofitably, and often fall into

many sins, which can very hardly be auoided in so great security & idlenes of minde. These, as long as they continue in this minde, shall neuer attaine remission of sins, for they haue no true purpose to leade an vpright life, but rather to continue in dissolute liuing.
            It cannot be denied, but that such like men liue in great daunger: for he that hath not a good and true purpose to preuaile, and ouercome all sinnes, he liueth in great daunger of damnation. For euen as he that lieth in the midst of a swift riuer, if he doth not labour to take fast footing, and raise vp his body, is in daunger to bee borne downe, and swallowed vp of the water: so in this spirituall life, which is like a deepe & dangerous riuer, he liueth in manye ieopardies of falling, who with

               the foundation of the Church, which

is Christ, some doe builde golde, siluer, pretious stones; others timber, haye, and stubble: and that euerie mans woorke shall be made manifest. For the daye of the Lorde, saith he, shall declare it, because it shall bee reuealed by the fire: and the fire shall trie euerye mans worke of what sort it is. They that haue builded gold, siluer, & pretious stones, they haue no cause to feare the fire: but they that haue builded timer, hay & stubble: their workes cannot but burn: yet so, that the timber doth burne longer then hay, and haye then stubble, which is consumed in the twinckling of an eie.

and correction, whereby we are held back, that we do not fal into the same againe: but so we teach, that they might not disturbe the peace of their harts, which is the center and place, in which God resteth. Griefe for sinne is good, but it must haue a moderation, least it runne into one of the extreames. Therefore the Apostle exhorteth the Corinthians, that they shoulde comforte him that was penitent; not because he esteemed heauines and sorrow for sin vnprofitable or euill, which in that place hee commendeth by many reasons, but least that penitentiary should be swallowed vp with too much heauines, & least he should despaire, who was so afflicted. And this is that, which we teach in this place.

It helpeth also to the cure of this griefe, with all might & main to endeuour, that no place bee giuen to scruples and anxieties, neither that we yeelde vnto their suggestions. For as that is the best way to driue danger from cattell, A Simily. to keepe them from feeding in dāgerous places: so also it is needfull that we doe, if we wil driue away the daungers of a scrupulous heart: especially seeing that we knowe that scruples are of that quality, that by the same waye, we open the gate to one, we open it also to others, so that a man may continue in this scrupulositye all the dayes of his life.
            It is a cause of scrupulositie, as we saide before, not to know the difference betweene thought and consent, but the one is taken to bee as haynous as the other,

offend publikely, he doth that he maye, delighting himselfe with filthy and vncleane thoughts, enioying a fantasticall delight, and an imaginarie pleasure, that after some maner hee may satisfie himselfe.
            By these and such like endeuours and studies a man may be cured of his scrupulosity: which albeit it seeme incurable in some, yet it may be cured: especially in those, that humbly submit themselues to others iudgement: such we see often cured, and restored to their right wits and former soundnes.
         
         
            
            THE FOVRTH IMPEdiment is any other bitternes or heauines of heart. CHAP. XX.
            NOt onely the irkesomenesse & heauines of minde, which ariseth of scruples, but generally euery displeasure and bitternes of hart, which proceedeth of anger, pensiuenesse, or of any such like roote, doth bring great hinderance vnto deuotion. For seeing that bitternesse and sweetenesse are contrary, it is certaine that it is most difficult, yea impossible, that the bitternesse of sin, and the sweetenesse of deuotion, (which is sweeter then all other delicates of the soule) can remaine together in one and the selfe-same heart.

                that we cast out al that disturbeth that peace and tranquility: least that heauenly guest depart out of it. Therefore it is meete and requisite that we be alwaies arme

of deuotion, as the other. Among which, the loue & sweetnes of comforts reaped by things externall and sensuall, is not the least, which altogether shutteth vppe the gate and entraunce to the loue and sweetenesse of spirituall things. For as no man calleth a Chyrurgian to the house A Simily. of a sound man, but to the house of him that is wounded: so God commonly sendeth not his Spirit, who is called the comforter, to their houses, that enioy vaine ioy and comfort, but to the houses of them, that be desolate and afflicted for his loue. Giue ye (saieth Salomon) strong drinke 
               The holy spirit is not sent but to those that bee desolate and afflicted. Prou. 31. 
               vnto him that is ready to perishe, and wine vnto them that haue greefe of heart. Let him drinke, that he may forget his pouerty, and remember his miserye noe more. Therefore to cure this griefe,

God ordained this medicine, which he sendeth not to the house of the whole, but of the sicke. Consolation, saith Barnarde, is a delicate and dainty thing; neither is it giuen to him, that seeketh it without God.
            A wife, chast and lawfull, who A Simily. deserueth and is worthy to be loued alone, thinketh an iniury to be done vnto her, if she be loued together with others. So also doth God: A figure of this wee haue in Exodus: for Manna, which had so great sweetnes in it, was Exod. 16. not giuen to the Israelits in the wildernes, before the meale was spent, which was brought out of Egipt: so neyther shall that bread of Angels be giuen vnto man in this exile and banishment, vntill he hath renounced al the delights and comfort of this world.
            Humane comfort is a verie iniurious

stepdame, if any man take it in steed of Diuine consolation: therefore it is necessary that it be cast out of doores, least perhaps it be an hindrance vnto the other.
            They doe the contrary, who on the one side will partake of the diuine consolation and sweetnes in Prayer: and afterwardes this exercise being ended will enioy worldly delights and pleasures: will eate and drinke daintily, be cloathed sumptuously, and liue in all wantonnesse and delicacy▪ to bee breefe who will so enioy God, that they will not loose nor forgoe the vanitye and do lights of the world. But let them certainely perswade themselues, that they shall neuer profit in the way of the Lord, so long as they walke thus lamely and haltingly.

            The Prophet Dauid very well

vnderstood this, when hee saith, My soule refused comfort (in earthly Psal. 77. matters) I did thinke vpon my God, and I was delighted and prayed, and my delight was so great, that my spirit fainted in me. Was this a good change: or wilt thou say that the Prophet was heerein deceiued, when as hee receiued for so small and ridiculous comforts, so ample and large consolations, with which his hart was so filled, that he could not beare the greatnes of them?
            This is the cause, why manye come and sit by the fountaine of these delights, without any other delight in the world: for theyr soules are filled vp to the brinke with inward delights. God is Deut. 5. iealous, & with exceeding great feruour doth loue our soules, as he himselfe confesseth: therefore he will not admit other delightes

and externall loues, neither will

            THE SIXT IMPEDIment is too much carke and care. CHAP. XXII.
            THe contrary vnto the impediment of delight and pleasure is this of too much carke and care: yet no lesse hurtefull then that: for cares and pleasures (as Christ saith) are thornes, which 
               Luke. 8.
               
               choke the word of God. Wherfore not without cause it is said of The two rootes of all euill. Saint Barnarde, that necessitie and desire are the two principall rootes of all the euils that be in the world.
            For all euils, that are committed in the world are done, eyther that necessitie may be auoyded, which bringeth punishment, or that some delight may be obtained, which procureth ioy. Therfore the cares of this necessitye hindreth as well the tast of Deuotion, as the quiet of Prayer: for they do so pricke & peirce ye hart that they do not permit a man to thinke vpon any other thing, thē of the cause from whence they spring: which alwayes presseth and pricketh the heart, and knocketh at the gate, neyther desisteth, vntill it obtaine that it sought.

               oy this sweete sleepe of life, among so many and so diuers perturbations & disturbances of things.
            But thou wilt say; Wilt thou A remedy against superfluous cares. giue mee any remedy, whereby I may eyther roote out, or chooke these encreasing cares, which so greatlie doe tosse and turmoile my heart? The presentest remedy is, if with all endeuour thou studiest (as much as is possible) to with drawe thy minde from all sensuall loue of thynges created, for from this loue all cares doe proceed, as we haue shewed before.

Therfore if thou wilt cease, or rather banish al afflicted thoughts, and carefull pensiuenes, labour to mortifie and kill in thee all externall and forraine loues. And although many thinges are required that thou mayst liue in thys life without carking and caring, yet they may all be contained in this short sentence. Doe not loue, and thou shalt not bee afflicted: neyther be delighted in the creatures, but as God hath willed. Beleeue me where this hath place, there true delight hath place: a greeuous taxe is set vpon them, that haue theyr loue and delight set vpon the creatures, and much greater are the sorrowes of the bringing foorth, then of the conception.
            An other remedy is: if we cast all our cares vpon God: hoping most assuredly, that God will

be ioyned together. For as a still and calme water is fitter & more disposed to represent the images of shapes of things, no otherwise then a glasse: so also in a quiet & calme soule, all things are represented most cleerely and perfectly. For this cause the deuill vseth all diligence, that he may comber and disturbe the heartes of men with a thousand kinde of businesses, paynting and imagining in them diuers false necessities of life, that they being busied and drowned in them, may haue neyther time nor minde to call vpon God.

            There is an other kinde of curiositye proper vnto the vnderstanding, and peculiarly belongeth vnto them, who of an only and sole desire to know, doe reade profane Histories, and heathen bookes, and vnprofitable Antiquities &c. In like sort they also may be called curious after the same maner, who apply their mindes to reade graue and learned Authors, and yet not with this intent, that by them they maye gaine vnto themselues tru

               Eccl. 21. 
               no knowledge whiles he liueth. Surelye this is a most manifest signe and token of a disordered wit, and of an inordinate soule. For as Saint Augustine saieth, It is an argument of a good wit, and of a noble and generous spirite, not to loue wordes in wordes, but the truth, that is couched in

For as Deuotion is a very delicate thing: so it is obscured and lost by a light and little matter. For if the morning Sun beames did hinder the contemplation of Saint Anthony: howe much more shall the vnquiet cogitations of seeking and keeping earthlye goods hurte, which haue well feathered winges swiftely to flye out of our sight?
            For this cause Euangelicall

pouerty is much to be commended. which at one blow cutteth off all this vaine curiositie, after his example, who when he was Lorde of all creatures, had none other bedde when he was borne, but a harde cratch, nor none other house, but the common stable.
         
         
            THE NINTH IMPEdiment is, if good exercises be interrupted and broken off. CHAP. XXV.
            
            IN like manner it is a great, and a very vsuall impediment vnto Deuotion, oftentimes to interrupt and break off the threed of good exercises without a lawefull cause. For wee must

know, that among all the miseries Our heart is easily inclined vnto euill, but hardly vnto good. of mans heart, one of the chiefest is, that as it is prompt and inclined to all euill, so it is remisse and slowe vnto any good. For in euill no other thing is required to inflame our heart, yea and our bodye too, but a light and small thought, which by and by vanisheth awaie: but for a good affection, as Deuotion is, wee must search heauen and earth, and desire ayde of all thinges, which are giuen vnto vs of God. Of man it is saide, That he is a winde that passeth and commeth not againe: For with Psal. 78. great facility he goeth after vanities, and corruptible thinges; but he returneth not againe from them, without great difficultie. Certainely, if men would ponder with reason all their miseries, they should feele none greater,

nor admire any more. Therfore wee must labour with al our strength, that Deuotion may be preserued: for as it is a very easie matter to loose it, so it is a most difficult thing to recouer it being lost.
            Wherefore not without cause we say, that it is a great impediment in this busines, if the threed of good exercises be broke of. For when as man would afterwardes returne vnto himselfe, hee findeth himselfe so vnapt, and so vnfit for Deuotion, as if he had neuer had it, or that he had onely saluted it at the doore, and very entrance. For that happeneth vnto him, which we reade in

                  •…
               appeneth vnto them, who are

negligent in this exercise, as Saint Barnarde saieth very well in these woordes: Howe long In his first booke of Consideration to Eugenius. wilt thou lifte vppe thine heart in prayer, and lifte it vp in vaine? Howe long wilt thou moue thy selfe, but not any whit the forwarder? Howe long wilt thou endeuour thy selfe, but to noe purpose? Doest thou labour, and not bring foorth? Doest thou make triall, and neuer a whit the better? And wheresoeuer thou beginnest, doest thou there leaue off? And in thine ass
                  •…
               ye, doest thou faint? All this difficulty hence ariseth, because the exercise of Deuotion is intermitted▪ therfore thy hart is vvaxen colde, and therefore by the iust iudgement of God this punishment is inflicted vppon thee: that thou being admonished by this punishment

for thine abuse of grace receaued, thou mayest more warilye preserue it being recouered againe. Salomon excellentlye teacheth this by a notable similitude: If the iron (saieth he) be blunte, and one hath not whet the 
               Eccl. 10. 
               edge, hee must then put to more strength, and after labour wisedome will followe. Which words, albeit they haue sundrye meanings, and may bee applyed to diuers things: yet most fitly they are vnderstoode of the study of Deuotion and of the holy Scriptures: of which Saint Hierome also doeth expound them. For experience it selfe teacheth, that 
                  〈◊〉
                a man hath at any time lost the vse of Deuotion and the feruour of the spirite, what great trou

                  •…
               ee hath eftesoones receaued,

let him be thorowly and for euer admonished, that most diligently he preserue so great benefits and blessings, least vnluckily hee againe relapse into the like misfortune.
            Furthermore, as the interrupting of this exercise doeth very much hinder Deuotion: so on the other side, the continuall vse of it Continuall vse of Deuotiō doth encrease it▪ Similies. is very conducent to the attayning of it. The tree that is watered in due season, doth encrease, and bringeth forth fruit: The childe that hath milk, and breasts ready to giue it sucke, when it desireth, groweth and waxeth bigger. A student in the liberall sciences, if he often repeate his lecture, and diligently frequent the schoole of his Mayster, in a shorte time commeth to the perfection of the Artes▪ hee studieth: so on the contra

part, hee that often and much intermitteth and breaketh off his study, eyther very late, or neuer becometh learned. For when after a certaine time he returneth againe to his study, hee hath forgotten those thinges, which before he had learned: and so still in beginning hee consumeth his age, and spendeth his time.
            It is true, that when the delay and intermission is short, or for some godly & lawfull cause, that God doth sooner restore that was lost. Hence it is that a faithfull and an obedient seruant sometimes feeleth his praier doubled, after that he hath performed his obedience. But this is without controuersie, that the perfect in this intermission walk with lesser Intermissiō of Deuotion doth lesse hurt the perfect then the vnperfect. daunger, then those that are yong beginners: for these are those that are of the poorer sort, and are

more hungry, if they labour not euery day, they haue not to eate: But those that are richer & more perfect, alwaies haue substance in themselues, by which they can for a time continue theyr estate, albeit they gaine no further matter. Therefore I thinke that this is one of the cheefe differences betweene the perfect and vnperfect, to wit, that the perfect are as trees planted in a moyst and fruiteful ground, which although they be not watered, by the space of certain daies, yet they preserue their greenenes, and bring foorth fruite: but the vnperfect are like trees standing in a dry and sandy earth, vpon which if water be not dayly powred, all the beauty and strength, which they had, perisheth: whereby it manifestly appeareth, that they wanted sap & moisture within thē. Of this sort at this

day is the greater part of those y•
                be Deuout; but the former sort are very few and scarce. Therfore let him that is desirous of Deuotition continue & perseuere in religious & godly exercises, & let him compose his life after the manner of a wel ordred clocke, doing all things in due time, and labouring as much as lyes in him, that the threed & continuance of deuotion be not broke off.
         
         
            THE TENTH IMPEdiment consisteth in delicates, and in too much meate and drinke. CHAP. XXVI.

               ious, which cōsistethin too much delicacy, & in superfluous meat & drink.

Therefore in the Scriptures Fasting and Prayer, as two brethren, are alwaies ioyned together; and for the same cause the holy Fathers, who hid themselues in the wildernes, that they might giue themselues to contēplation were so austere in theyr fastes and abstinence.
            For wee see, that as corporall fasting doth lift vp the spirit to God: so on the other side superfluity of meate & drink doth cast it downe, & hindreth the course. The reason is, because to lift vp the spirit to contemplate that eternal light, and to order and dispose it for the receipt of ye
                influences and splendors of that light, is a thing so hard, and so supernaturall, that as Augustine saith, it is necessary that a man bring al his force and strength together, that hee may vse it in this ascending, if he will

This is that Saint Hierome perswadeth In his Epist to Laeta. vnto a certaine Virgin, saying; Let the fare of a Virgin be a few hearbes, and sometimes a few small fishes. Let her so eate, that she may alwaies be hungry, that foorthwith after meate she may bee able to read, and pray. The same man also admonisheth that it is better alwayes to keepe In his Epist. to Furia. this rule in eating and drinking, then sometimes too wide to open the sailes of fasting, so that the body is enfeebled thereby; & by & by after to lose the raines vnto the gullet, that man thereby is in daunger of bursting. The same man also in another place, & in other words, saith: A spare dyet, & a belly alwaies hungry is preferred before a fast of three daies, & it is better euery day to take a little, then once to take enough.
            That is the best rayne, which

leysurely descendeth vppon the earth. A sodaine and dashing showre headlong beateth downe the corne and grasse. Therefore when thou eatest thinke that presently after thou art to read and pray. Hetherto Hierome.
            
            They that liue with such moderation and temperance, shall haue great treasuries and storehouses of time, and in fewe dayes shall liue a long life: for all the time of their life is profitable, and not any part of it vainely passeth away. Therefore albeit a righteous man dye quickly, yet he hath a long life: for he profitteth euery houre, and maketh gaine of euery moment of his life. But the wicked & vngodly, whose belly is their God, they alwaies carry about a soule dead in life, & buried in the dunghill of too much meate & drinke: and so in a manner

they spend all their life time, in vnbuckling theyr girdles, & in prouiding & dressing superfluous meates, and in drawing foorth their houres in sleep. These therfore liue like Epicures, & as people borne to none other end, then to eate and drink, and to engrosse and fat their bellies, intending none other exercise, neither hauing regard of any other time, or busines. How then can any one say, that these doe liue a long life, or the life of a man, when as scarcely they bestow one hower vpon any thing, which is worthy the spirit & nobility of man.
         
         
            
            THE ELEVENTH IMpediment is the euill disposition and weakenes of the bodie. CHAP. XXVII.
            
            AN impediment contrary to the former is (as saith Saint Bernarde) too much abstinence, and weakenes of body, or whatsoeuer other euill disposition or debility, whether it be hunger or thirst, or colde, or heate, or whatsoeuer other accident. For there is so great society and sympathy between the soule and the body, that when as this is ill disposed, or standeth need of any thing, the other cannot lift it selfe vp freely inough to contemplate and meditate on heauēly things with quietnesse and tranquilitye: for

the loue of her friend doth call her away and doth disquiet he
                  •…
               , and calleth her thither, where it is greeued: neyther granteth her leaue to attend any other busines, vnlesse God of his especial grace doth dispence with it: as many times he is wont to doe.
            Therefore it is meete that a Deuout man keep that moderation and temperaunce in chasticing and exercising his body, that it neyther growe grosse nor vnfit by superfluous delicates; neyther that bee weakenes by too much rigour and austerity, that it faint vnder the burden.
            For as we are to obserue in a 
                  •…
               harpe, that the stringes be neyther stretched too streight, nor loosened too slacke (for then they are eyther broken, or yeeld an vntuned and an vnpleasant sound) so in this celestiall Musicke,

it is meet that the body bee neyther macerated by too much hunger, nor fatted by two much plenty: for both of them bring very much hurt to this exercise. For this cause God commaunded in the old law that salt (by which we vnderstand discretion) should be spinkled vpon al the sacrifices, that he might insinuat, that none of our sacrifices (although they be great) are acceptable vnto him vnlesse they be seasoned with salt, that is, with the sauour of discreation.
            But because it is a hard thing to keep a meane, and the fleshe doth alwaies seeke it selfe, therefore it is necessary, that in these cases a mans own opinion bee alwaies suspected vnto himself: & if we must needs leane to one of ye
                extremities, it is alwaies more safe, that we chose that, which is

most repugnant to the flesh, then that which fawneth & smileth on

There are also other particuler hindrances, according to the naturall dispositions and affections of euery one. As we see that certaine are so vnnaturally studious and diligent in that, which they haue determined to doe, that if they haue the least thing in the world in hand, they cannot rest till it be done: nay they cannot sleepe in the night, before they haue finished, that they purposed: and therefore they neuer haue any leysure to perseuere in Prayer.

            Let these men knowe, that they are the deuils slaues, and that the Deuill leadeth them bound in chaynes, whither he listeth, euen to theyr perdition and destruction. Therefore let them beware, and seriously regard what is the cause of this their deuiation and seduction, for without all doubt (and so let them perswade themselues) it is the worke of the deuill.
            But aboue all particuler impedymentes, the inordinate lou

ligious, or so free from passions, that hath not some idoll, that he serueth, and adoreth: that is, some thing, vpon which he bestoweth his whole affections, and for the loue of which, he doth all that he can. The minde of some is wholy swallowed vp in the studye of science and eloquence: and vpon these two studies they bestow all their endeuour and paines: so that they seeke no other thing in the worlde, they respect no other thing, but onely this: supposing that there is nothing greater then this studye, nor any thing more worthy the spirit and nobility of man.
            The desire of worldly honour, the fauour of Princes and great personages, and the possessions of temporal goods doe draw others away. Thou shalt see many, who are altogether busied in heaping

together great treasuries, that they may enrich their heyres, and be saide to be the authours and founders of some noble house and family. There be also not a fewe, whose mindes are lesse generous, that then suppose themselues happy, when they haue scraped together a certaine sum of money, whereby they maye purchase for themselues some inheritance, or some office. There be others, that thinke of nothing more, then of some famous & notable mariage, either for thēselues or for some of theirs, whether he be son, daughter, or cosin german: for this being obtained, they suppose that there is nothing, which may further be desired. To be briefe, others are caried awaye and bound with other affections and desires, no otherwise then beasts are bound at a cratch, euery

one with their seueral halters. And when they haue once opened a way for these affectiōs vnto their heart, with the same study & loue ye men embrace the last end, they seeke & follow after meanes, by which they may obtain, that they desire. Therfore some, night and day apply their bookes, that they may come to their wished ende: Others, as long as they liue, doe wholy endeuor thēselues to heap & hoard vp welth. Others giue thē selues to traffike & merchandise, or do some other thing, that they may gaine vnto themselues, that they seeke for. For after that they

               hey, to giue place to al the branches that sprout & spring from it. These without doubt are hurtfull plants, these are those thornes in the gospel, which choak the seed of the word of god. For the mā ye
               
is enwrapped in these businesses with so superfluous a care, hath neyther time, nor minde at liberty to attend vpon the seruice of God.
            Therefore it happeneth many times, that the deuil doth presently disturbe a man in Prayer, withdrawe him from his exercise, and casteth him headlong from heauen vpon the earth: and oftentimes haleth & pulleth him, that he may turne himselfe to effect
                  •…

                and inuite him: so that when god calleth him to his table, to his embrace, to the fruition of his ioyes, and participation of his spirit, he will not come, he contemneth the voyce of the Lorde and with greedines doth follow
                  •…

after this manner. For they are A Simily. as that vnprofitable seede in the Gospell, that fell vppon stonye ground, where it had not much earth, and anon it sprong vp, because it had no depth of earth, & when the Sunne rose vp, it was parched, and for lacke of rooting, withered away. Such neuer haue any stability nor steedfastnesse in their manner of liuing: for euen A Simily. as the Sea swelleth when the Moone encreaseth, and ebbeth, when it decreaseth: so these are gouerned by the fluxe & refluxe of spirituall consolations: nowe they haue their sences and spirits gathered together, presently after dispersed & disseuered: sometimes they are deuout, somtimes vndeuout and dissolute: nowe quiet, nowe vnquiet: for whe

                constancye besides diuine consolations,

they cannot be stable nor constant in their maner of liuing.
            In like maner there be many, who when they doe not finde in their prayers those teares, and that compunction, they wishe, they endeuour to wrest it foorth by violence, and to expresse it as it were by the force & strength of their armes: who by howe much more they labour in this kinde, by so much they become harder, and more desolate and destitute of their purpose.
            Which the Lorde hath so disposed, that they may vnderstand that this water & moysture is not of bloud, but of heauen: and that it is not compassed by mans strength, but is waited for by humility and patience, when and howe the Lorde will giue it: for he it is, as it is written in Iob,

Who bindeth the waters in his cloudes, and the cloude is not broken vnder them, who holdeth back the face of his throne, & spradeth his cloud vpon it. Who couereth the light 
               Iob. 36. 
               with the cloudes, and commandeth it to come againe.
            
            But that it may more manifestly be declared, which hath been spoken, I will in this place set downe the causes, for which god many times doth withdrawe and deny vnto his, spirituall consolations, and what at this time is to be done.
         
         
            
            REASONS OR CAVSES, for which God now and then denieth to his friendes spirituall consolations. CHAP. XXX.
            
            FIrst and formost in this place we are to knowe, that God doth not alwaies take comfortes and consolations from his seruants, because their sinnes and offences haue deserued it: but oftē
               times for other causes: Among which this is first and chiefest, 1 that the health and life of the righteous may be preserued. For nowe and then it commeth to passe, that such is the greatnesse of ioye and comfort, which is felt in praier, and which God bestoweth of his bounty, wisedome

and goodnesse vpon his, that if it should long continue, neyther the feeble bodye could beare it, neyther coulde they remember, what the necessity of their body required: but they would neglect to relieue themselues.
            Therefore our gratious Lorde doth sometimes take from them those consolations and that celestiall sweetnesse, that they may recure the weakenesse of their body, and so their life might be preserued without miracle, which being continued, they at the last might enioy a greater and a more royall crowne.
            Sometimes hee doeth this 2 that humility may be preserued, that we may know that this goo

            For this cause, saieth a certaine holy man, it is often denyed, when it is sought for; and it is graunted, when it is not expected: that thereby it may appeare that it is the worke of the diuine grace.
            In like manner God doeth away 3 his consolations, that hee may prooue and trie vs: that is,

not alwaies be occupied in the exercise of a contemplatiue life: but that he also may descende to the actiue, in which also it behooueth vs to be exercised, that we may be skilfull and expert in all kinde of vertue, that we may saye with the Prophet: My heart is prepared O God, my hart is prepared. He saieth twise prepared, that hee might signifie that his heart was prepared for the consolations of a contemplatiue life, and also for the troubles of an actiue, for the sweetenesse of the diuine loue, and for laboures for the loue of his neighbour, for the Crosse, and for the kingdome, to supp with the Lord at his table, and to descende with him to the battaile.
            This is that the wiseman admonisheth vs of, when he saith: Let not thine hande be stretched

out to receiue, and close fisted to giue. For we must not onely bee prepared to receiue diuine graces but also to be sacrificed for him, if need require.

sweetnes and delicacies of the contemplatiue, which certainely is graunted but to very few.
            It also happeneth that there are certaine religious persons 5 found, which alwaies in a manner liue in the continuall drynesse of heart, and that not through their owne sault, but because it so pleaseth the Lord, who wil not alwaies bring his elect by the same way, nor saue them after one manner: but after many and sundry waies: that so his Wisedome, and prouidence might more appeare through those sundrye meanes, which he vseth in promoting and procuring the saluation of his elect.
            Therefore hee doth not worke alwayes after the same manner, as they that doe all thinges after one example and type: but after many and sundry

wayes, as hee that is free, & can doe whatsoeuer it pleaseth his diuine Maiestie.
            So that as hee himselfe is an infinite vertue: so hath hee dyuers wayes to worke our saluation. I knowe, sayth a certaine Doctor, that this Doctrine wil be very welcome vnto certaine luke warme and idle persons: for they are wont to take this to veyle and cloake theyr negligence, saying: that they feele and taste no Deuotion not through their own negligence, but by the diuine dispensation, when notwithstand

            Besides the reasons remembred, there is another, and that God denyeth comfort vnto his, that they be more perfect. not the least, to wit, because God wold lift vp his elect to the highest degree of perfection. For wee must not be ignorant, that spirituall consolations are the foode o

it is needfull that there be two seasons, assigned for these two knowledges: one in which man may know by experience his owne miserie: the other in which by the same experience hee may learne to know the diuine mercy, that by this knowledge hee may be more lifted vp to the loue of God, & by the other that he may more basely account of himselfe.
            By this it is manyfest, how greeuously they erre, who relinquishe

            Worthyly did that holy widdow Iudith blame them, who had set downe a time, when God should help them, in which time, if he did not succour them, they decreede to looke for his ayde no longer.

               Iudith. 8. 
               is not the way to procure mercy, but rather to prouoke anger, & kindle furie. Doe you appoint a time for the mercy of the Lord? and set downe a day, when he should deliuer you?

            WHAT A MAN ought to doe, when as the current of the diuine consolations is stayed. CHAP. XXXI.
            VVHen as thou seest thy selfedestitute of diuine consolations, thou must not intermit nor breake off thine accustomed exercise of prayer, albeit it seeme vnsauery vnto thee. Yea then thou must come before the presence of the Lord, as one guilty and culpable, to examine, and with great diligence to search

thine owne conscience, and to make inquisition, whether it bee thy fault that thou hast lost the cōforts of the holy Ghost. Which if thou findest to be so, cast thy selfe humbly before his feet with that holy sinner, & feare with the Publican to lift vp thine eyes to heauen: cast thy selfe vpon the bowels of his infinite loue, & beseech him with great trust & confidēce, that he wold pardon thee, & shew thee the riches of his mestimable patience & mercy: as well in expecting, as in pardoning him, of whome so often hee hath been prouoked to anger. If thou wilt doe this, thou shalt, extract and drawe fruite out of thy drynesse, yea out of thine offence; 
                  •…
               hereby taking occasion to 
                  •…
               aumble thy selfe, whylst thou 
                  •…
               eest the greatnesse of thy 
                  •…
               innes; and further cause of

greater loue to God, whilst thou seest how many and howe great sinnes he hath forgiuen thee. And also thou shalt be more wary and circumspect afterwardes, that thou sleep not, or be secure in the fight, when it goweth on: for this is the vsuall and common commoditity, which the righteous receiue by their fals.
            And although in thine exer
                  •…
                
               We must do that in praier that we may. cises thou feelest no sweetnes, yet thou must not abstaine from thē: for it is not necessary, that it shuld alwaies be sweet, which is profitable: for oftentimes the contrary hapneth.
            What shall become of the sic

                and weake, if they wholy abstain
                  •…

                  •…
                somtimes they eat without taste
                  •…
                that by little and little togethe
                  •…
                with their helth, they may recoue
                  •…
               
               
their taste. This experience teacheth, that a man, as often as he continueth in prayer with some attentiuenes and diligence, doing that little he can, that at length he goeth away ioyfull & full of consolation: seeing that little he did for his part, and vnderstanding that he can doe much before the Lord, who doth all that he can, although it be but little.
            That poore Widdowe cast no more into the treasurie but Luke. 21. two mites, and yet by the sentence of Christ she is extolled aboue al the rich, who cast in much more. For the Lord respecteth not the quantity of the gift offered, but especially the ability and 
                  •…
               vill of the giuer. He giueth much who desireth to giue enough, who giueth that he hath, who keepeth 
                  •…
               othing to himself, who omitteth 
                  •…
               othing that lyeth in him.
            
               
What great matter is it to pray, when many consolations are present? euery worldly man can doe this.
            It is a hard thing when the deuotion is small, then to powre foorth longer prayers, to haue greater humility patience, & perseuerance in good workes. The cheefest commendation of a Pilot A Simily. of a ship is not in that he know eth well to guide his vessel, when the sea is calme: but when a tempest approacheth, then to know how to giue saile, & how to take it in, how to guide the sterne, how to man his ship, howe to conquer fortune by diligence, an
                  •…

                deed. When consolation; are absent we must watch the more diligently.
            
            Secondly, it is necessary th

at other times: for then we must stand vpon our watch, and vpon our court of guarde: our words, workes, thoughts, and whatsoeuer is ours is then to be examined and searched into. For because spirituall ioy doth then fayle vs, which in this our Nauigation is the chiefest oare, it is to be supplyed with diligence and attention; although this also be grace, and that not the least. When thou seest thy selfe in this estate, thou must looke (as Saint Bernarde sayth) whether the sentinelles, which did keepe thee, doe sleep: 
                  •…
               or whether the wall is fallen 
                  •…

                  •…

               nd thy skill in fighting.
            
               
O how great is the glory of that soule, which defendeth her selfe without a shield, & fighteth without weapons, is strong without fortitude, and fighting onely receiueth strength without help.
            Among all the valiantes and worthies of Dauid, Benaiah is especially 2. Sam. 23. praysed, who slew a Lion in the time of snow. It is great glory to kill a Lion; but much greater to kil him in winter time, when the handes are benummed with colde, so that they can scarcely brandish a swoorde. Wherefore when the soule is altogether colde and frozen, neyther feeleth any heate of charitye in her: yet if shee at that time fight valiantly with the roaring Lyon, and ouercome him, is she
                  •…

And the Deuill, who came merry to this combate, shall returne, from whence he came sorrowfull and confounded: and he that would haue destroied thee, shall giue thee an occasion of greater glory.
            Wherefore if thy minde bee chast and pure, if thou commest not to God, to satisfie thine owne will, but for loue of him, neither respectest the house of thy beloued, but the beloued himselfe, there is no cause, why thou shouldest be sad and sorrowful; for he will giue thee what thou desirest, and that which best pleaseth him, although it be not altogether so delectable. We must here note that this combate and strife wit

can cure this inconuenience with great and vehement endeuours and striuings: and they doe so plunge and turmoyle themselues in this combate, that at the length they weary and hurt both heart and head.
            Whence it commeth, that they cannot long continue in prayer: and when they haue once forsaken it, they naturally abhorre it, and are afrayde to returne vnto it, as to a thing full of griefe & labour.
            This is a verye great errour: for it is not a businesse of force

thou look for of this earth, cursed of thy mouth, and excommunicated of thee, but thornes and briers?

After that he hath thus spoken let him returne to his former exercise, and let him expect with patience the visitation of the lord, who is not wont to be slow.
            But that this may be vnderstood the better, wee must obserue in this place, that our heart is like a morish & fenny lake, which doth send foorth many grosse vapours, by which it doeth so darken the ayre, that scarce any thing can be seene cleerely in it: but when the Sun ariseth, by little and little those vapours are dissolued, and vanish away, and the heauen becommeth faire and cleere.

as the former doe, but scarcely one praier being ended, they forthwith thinke of another: and at the first occasion they returne vnto it, as to a thing of great plesure, other busines being either left alone, or speedily dispatched: for it is written, They that eat me, shall haue the more hunger, and they

               that drinke me, shal thirst the more. This then is the reason, why some flie the labors of praier, as a thing trouble some and tedious: and others perseuere in it, as in a thing delightfull and pleasant: which they very well know, who haue learned that by experience, which in this place we haue taught.

               Eccle. 3. 
               too hard for thee, neither search the things rashly which are too mighty for thee. But what God hath commaunded thee, think vpon that with reuerence, and be not curious in many of his workes: for it is not needful for thee, to see with thine eyes the things that are secret. Be not curios in superfluous things, for many things are shewed vnto thee about the capacity of men.

                may be hindred.
            
               
When it ariseth of necessity, that is not to be denied to the body, which is his: least in like manner it hinder that, which is ours. For great is the force of nature, and it will not be defrauded of things belonging vnto it. when it is bred of infirmity, let not a man trouble or vexe himselfe, for it is not his fault; neither let him be altogether ouercome of it, but let him for his part doe what hee may, nowe vsing some industry, nowe and then some violence; that his prayer may not altogether slacke, without which nothing in this life can be possessed safely.
            But when it proceedeth of idle

               lesh, y• so sleep may be shakē off.
            
               
But especially fasting doth help: for sleepe, and meate are almost alwaies ioyned together, & do go together: so y•
                after too much meat followeth too much sleep, and after moderate diet, moderate sleep: so much as is withdrawen from meate, so much in a manner is taken from sleep. It is written of Saint Basill, that oftentimes hee passed ouer whole nights without sleep; for he was very temperate in his dyet. And this was the cause why the Saints could watch so much, and so long, for they were great fasters.
            To be breefe it is a very great remedy for this euill, as also for all others, to craue ayde and help of him, who is alwaies ready to giue it vnto them that aske it. For this prouidence is denyed to no creature, whether it bee in the sea, or vpon the earth, much lesse

shall it bee denied to man being created after his image & likenes. Therefore let vs bee humble and faithfull, & let vs perseuere in crauing mercy, which if we doe, hee will faithfully giue vs, that we desire: according to that; A carnall man crediteth the law of God, & the law is faithful vnto him. For the promisses of God do not deceiue him, to whome faith & hope are not wanting. This is that which I thought good to speake of, too much sleep, which is to be auoided not onely for the loue of prayer, but also for the time, which is vnprofitably spent in it. For if one

already finished thy course, and that thou art come to an end, whē as scarcely thou art well entred. By both of them thou art defrauded of thy wished end.

bountifull in giuing. For an argument of which, consider how out of women a long time barren he brought forth most excellent and famous men, as Isaac, Sampson, Samuel, Iohn Baptist, and many others. By which example comfort thy selfe, for oftentimes the labour of many yeares is discouered in one day.
            If thine owne frailtie, the Diuels force, the iniquitie and malignitie of the present time, and whatsoeuer els may driue thee backwards, do terrifie thee; consider that there are many moe, which are on thy side, both in number and valour.

Saint Paule was caryed vp to such an height, that hee himselfe knew not, whether he was in his body, or without his bodie. Surely as he had ascended aboue all creatures, so also he had aspired beyond himselfe, and was wholy swallowed vp in God.

            If the Scripture say of the Queene of Saba, that there was no more spirit in her, and that she 3. Reg. 10. was greatly astonied, when she

saw the workes of Salomon: what shall be done to that soule, whose eyes the holy Ghost openeth, by that diuine light, to see, not the greatnes of Salomons workes, who was an earthly man, but the greatnes of the works of God, in which so many wonders are to be seene? I say, of workes, as well of nature, as of grace and glory?

                they diligently take heed,

that whilst they desire to profit others, they deceiue not thēselues, albeit the profit of our neighbour, ought to bee lesse in this respecte: for the law of charitye doth not commaund vs to benefit others with our apparant hurt and manifest dammage. But what and if I shall prooue, that not onelye the profit of our neighbour is not diminished, but wonderfully encreased, and that it is the onely & best way to helpe our neyghbour, by first helping of our selues.
            Beleeue me, my brother, if in deed thou studiest to profit thy A good life is the best instruction of our neighbour. neyghbour, there is none other way more conuenient to doe it, then a good life, and the exercise of prayer & meditation, by which this good life is gained vnto vs. Which doctrine I could approue by many reasons, but by reason of

the smalnes of this volume, it shal be sufficient heere to haue set downe a few of them.
            The first is, that it is manyfest to all men, that the true and proper 1 instrument, by which wee may help our neighbour, is true wisedome. But to obtaine this, what is more profitable then the feare of God? then an approoued life? then the dayly vse and experience of vertues? or the prayer and the continuall meditation of the diuine law? What is so frequent and common in the holy Scripture, as that; The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome. and: The fulnes of Wisedome is the feare of the Lord.
            
            Yea without this meane it is vnpossible to obtaine this vertue: which Saint Augustine plainely testifieth in these words: We Augus. in 
                     〈◊〉
                   Sermon. finde many moste negligent

and careles of righteousnes, but most greedy and desirous of wisedome: the diuine Scripture doth teach these, that they cannot attaine that they desire, but by keeping and preseruing that they neglect. O my Sonne, saith the diuine writ, if thou desirest Wisdome, preserue righteousnes, and the Lord will shew her vnto thee. Wisedome is a grace of God, and a principall gift of the holy Ghost; therefore it is sooner and more easily got by teares, then by disputations: by prayers, then by alterations.
            Rightly therefore saith Augustine; They that haue learned Augu of the words of the Apostle of the Lord Iesus Christ to bee meeke, and humble in heart, doe profit more by meditating and praying, then by reading & hearing. But if wisdome be a principal instrument to help others, why

shall not also the meanes, by which it is obtained, bee of the same kinde, of which wee haue now spoken?
            The second reason is: To conuert soules vnto God, is a worke 2 maruellous excellent and supernaturall: for by this, theyr corrupt nature, that liue wickedly, is subdued: and their euill custome, which is little weaker then nature, and that which is more, the power of the deuill, who possesseth, and most strongly holdeth captiue their harts, are ouercom'd and conquered. That such powers shuld be oppressed & ouerthrowen, it is necessary that greater power & strēgth should be present, which is not found vpō the earth, but in heauen: which is not so wel got by study, labor & speculation, as by teares, sighings, & the course of a good life.
            
               
Hence it is, that they that are conuerted vnto God, are no lesse the sonnes of teares, then of words: so that prayer hath no lesser part in the conuersion, then the finest oration of a most eloquent orator.
            Wherefore, as the prayer of Moses rather procured the victory against Amalech, then all the Exod. 17. swordes, that were drawen: so also wee muste suppose and beleeue, that in this victory the praiers, sighes, and grones of a true preacher haue no lesser part, then all the other voices and words, albeit they be ingenious, acute, and eloquent.
            The third reason is, because (as experience witnesseth) mē do 3 offend more grossely and foulely by the corruption of their owne affections and passions, then by the ignorance of the truth. Therefore

whosoeuer applyeth himself to bridle and restraine others, and to reforme their affections, hee must rather mooue their will, thē instruct their vnderstanding: and therefore all the masters of eloquence do teach, that there is not That thou maist moue another, it is necessary that thou be fir

                  t moued thy self a more present remedye for this malady, then that first thou bee mooued vnto that, to which thou desirest to mooue another. This is that which Quintilian saith; The sum & chiefe of this matter, saith he, as far as I can gather, cōsisteth in this, that if we would mooue others, that we be first mooued our selues. And a little after; The oration ought to be pronounced frō such a minde, which may mooue. For how can it bee, that another should grieue, that heareth, vnles I first greeue, that speak? how shal I incense another to anger, if I my selfe be not angry? how shal another

weep, if he see mee speaking with dry eyes? It cannot be. F

                nothing setteth on fire, or maketh to burne but fire: nothing maketh another thing moyste but water: neyther can any man impart heate to another, if hee hath it not himselfe.
            Therefore according to that of Quintilian, who doubteth but that a Deuout man, who night & day doth nothing els, but bewayle and meditate in the law of the Lord, is better, and fitter to teach, then any othe

To all these another help is ioyned much more wonderfull, that is, the example of his life that preacheth. For there is no greater argument, that that should be beleeued which a man speaketh then that he that speaketh it doe it himselfe; and that his life agree with his doctrine. Among all sermons that is moste profitable and effectuall, by which the auditour is most edified, and moste profited by.
            Wherefore seeing that the sanctity of life is also supernaturall and Diuine, the righteous are as the tongues and mansions of the holy Ghost, and all men naturally doe reuerence them, & honor them with a worship more then humane, and doe beholde and heare them, not as men, but as Angels; not as inhabitants of the earth, but as Citizens of heauen,

and doe admire their labors and workes, as remnants and remaynders of the holy Ghost. All these things being considered of, doe sufficiently shew, how auaileable it is to the helping and instructing of others in the way of vertue, if the master and teacher himselfe be godly and an embracer of vertue.
            Therefore they that from their hearts doe seeke God, and not themselues, ought not to respect honor, nor liberty, nor dignitie,

               ne of all men, what they are. But this dooth offer it selfe

with so faire an aspect, and seemeth so honest, that one would think that none other thing could be wished, neither that any fraude or collusion was vnder it. And this temptation is so much the greater, by how much he is more vertuous, that is tempted: for by how much hee loueth vertue, by so much he studieth for the profit of his neighbor, & for the common good.
            For euen as nothing is more naturall vnto God, then to do wel vnto all his creatures: so he that participateth more of the spirit & goodnes of God, he is more ready to doe good vnto others: so that nothing doth beare more rule in the heartes of good men, then an vnpatient and continuall desire to doe good to those that be good, and to succour and releeue them in all things.
            
               
For this cause that crafty and ancient seducer of man, in this matter hath alwayes bin troublesome vnto the righteous: knowing that nothing is more fit to deceiue them, then that, to which of their owne accord they are inclined. And so we see that many are cast headlong into most difficult and hard matters, and take such burdens vpon them, which doe exceede their strength and power, and that vnder pretence and colour of this help and ayde.
            Therefore we ought not to take greater heed of any desire, then of this, which doth creepe into our soules vnder colour and show of this good, and of this vertue; for it may procure vnto vs great strife and trouble. Holy Iosua, seeing Ios. 3. the Angell of God in the army, did not credit him before he had asked, Art thou ours? or our

aduersaries? So we ought not to giue credit to euery motion and thought, although it seemeth good: for we know that the angell of Sathan can transforme himselfe oftentimes into an Angell of light, which he doth more often and more vsually in this worke, then in another, because he commeth hither vnder colour of piety, and as though he would inuite vs vnto charity. Therefore not without good cause the Fathers in the wildernes sayde, that oftentimes the Diuell doth call a religious man from the exercise of prayer vnder pretence of those things that are good, whilest he perswadeth them that there is a iust and an important cause, why they should do this and that, when in very deede there is none.
            Therefore it is not sufficient

heere to looke into, only the quality and condition of the worke, but also to scanne thorowly all circumstances, which according to the rule of wisedome are to be considered of. Amongst other things, we must especially beware, that we do not so endeuour to profit our neighbour, that wee disprofit our selues, according to that of Ecclesiasticus; Helpe thy neighbour according 
               Eccles. 29. 
               to thy power, and beware that thou thy selfe fall not. And albeit the remedyes set downe in the former Chapter against this euill be sufficient, yet I will also adde vnto them the opinion of Saint Bernard, who writeth of Bernard in his fyrst booke of consideration. this matter vnto Pope Eugenius, and amōgst other things he saith: Heare then what I reprehend, & what I perswade. If thou bestowest all thy life and wisedome vpon

action, and nothing vpon consideration: in some thing I commend thee: but in this I do not praise thee. And I thinke that no man will praise thee, who hath learned that of Ecclesiasticus: He shall get wisedome, that hath vacant 
               Eccles. 38. 
               time, and is free from action. Certainely neither is he meete for action, who doth not before meditate and consider vpon it. If thou wouldest be euery bodie vnto all, like him, that was made all for all: I commend thine humanity: if it be complete. But how is it complete, thy selfe being excluded? and thou also art a man. Therefore that thine humanity may be absolute & compleate, let it receiue thy selfe also into that bosome, into which it receiueth others. Otherwise wh
                  •…
               t shall it profit thee according to the word of the Lord, if thou

winnest all men, and losest thy selfe? wherefore when thou possessest all men, possesse also thy selfe. Why alone doest thou defraude thy selfe of thy gifts? whither doth thy spirit go, not returning againe? why doest thou not looke vnto thy selfe by course, as thou doest to others? Thou art a debter both to the wise and vnwise: and only doest thou deny thy selfe vnto thy selfe? The foole and the wiseman, the seruant and the freeman, rich and poore, man and woman, old and yong, clergy and layty, the iust and vniust, all and euery one do together participate of thee: all doe drinke of the common fountaine of thy breast: and wilt thou stand apart thirsty? If he be accursed that maketh his owne part the worst: what shall he be that vtterly maketh himselfe without part. Thy

waters are deriued into currents through the streetes: men and cattell do drinke of them: thou giuest drinke also to the Camels of Abrahams seruant: but among the rest drinke thou also of the fountaine of thine owne well. Let not a stranger, saith he, drinke of it. What? art thou a stranger? To whom art thou not strange, if thou beest strange to thy selfe? To be briefe, he that is rechlesse and barren to himselfe, to whom is he good? Hetherto be the words of Bernard, which may suffice to conuince that we say; and that by them we may vnderstād, that the great promoters and procurers of other mens safeties, ought not to be vnmindfull of their owne: but with great diligēce to regard their owne saluation. And also what great wisdome we haue neede of, to order

this busines aright, least we be deceiued by an vndiscreet feruour of charity, and by too great a desire of spirituall gaine. In which matter we are to imitate the wise Virgins in the Gospell, who when the foolish Virgins desi

                prayer. For albeit that other

mens businesses ought to be ordered, and to haue their houres and appointed times (as we haue heard out of Bernard) yet they do not require that measure of time, which this continuall diligence doth, by which is effected, that the spirit is alwayes vnited to God, and alwayes caried towards him. To conclude, let vs also adde this (which in my iudgement Prayer is to be ioyned vnto preaching. is very pertinent to our purpose) if thou desirest nothing more, then to help thy neighbor and if thou doest looke into th

of God, by which the life is amended.
            Therefore let this rule be obserued, if thou wouldest not erre in this busines, if the ministration of the diuine word be committed vnto thee, beware that thou no further entangle thy selfe in worldly and temporall matters, then thy strength is able to beare, although it cary neuer so fayre a shew of charitie. For although the Apostles were full of the holy Ghost, yet they put from them all such kinde of burdens, so that they woulde not make prouision for the maintenance of the poore. Wherefore in the fourth Councell of Carthage In the 4. Councel of Carthage, can. 17. and 18. it is commaunded, that a Bishop by himselfe should not take vpon him the gouernment and ouerseeing of widowes, orphanes, and strangers, but that he

should do it by his Archdeacon. In like maner that he should not take vpon him the ouersight of wills & testaments, that he might the better attend vpon reading, prayer and preaching. We haue also an example of this thing in our Sauiour, who whē he was requested of one, to commaund his brother to diuide his inheritance with him, he answered: Man,

            CERTAINE ADMOnitions to be obserued in this exercise against the fraudes and collusions of our auncient enemy. CHAP. XLI.
            HEtherto we haue spoken of certaine common temptations, which are wont to molest and annoy them that are at prayer; now we will deliuer certaine admonitions & instructiōs, which are to be obserued in this course. And although we haue set downe certain in the end of the first part of this booke; yet, because they are only put in the end, that they may teach vs to pray, I will set downe others heere, which may

lay open the deceipts and fraudes of our enemy the Deuill, who many wayes is wont to deceiue those, that walke in this way, turning good medicines into present poysons, and to shipwracke them in the very hauen.
            Therefore first of all let vs presuppose, that nothing can bee There is nothing so good, but it may be abused by the malice of man. found in this world so good and profitable, but that by mans malitiousnes it may be abused vnto euill. Wherefore euill men take occasions to perseuere in their wickednes of the very goodnes and mercy of God, and of the passion of Christ. Neyther onely do they take occasions of these things, but also of vertue hir selfe, which no man can abuse, following their own affections, wherby oftentimes they take opportunity to offend. For we see many men that of fasting, abstinēce,

knowledge, chastitie, and such like vertues, do take an occasion to be prowde, and to presume great things of themselues: making that a matter and an occasion of mischiefe and euill, which of it selfe is an excellent and an honorable good. Wherefore S. Ambrose sayth: As I very well vnderstand that chastity is an excellent good, so I feare the theefe of pride, least he steale away that which is good.
            Therefore I do not so greatly maruell, if the vertue of Meditation be sometimes vnprofitable to some man, or if it doth bring dammage vnto him, that knoweth not how to vse it conueniently. But as it is an intollerable madnes to leaue the vertue of Chastity, or any other vertue or science, for none other cause, but because certaine abuse it, and by

it are proudely puffed vp; so also is it a foolish thing to relinquish meditatiōs for the abuse of some. For there is nothing vnder heauen, which we may not abuse.
            That we may vnderstand this the better, we must know that there is not any vertue, which hath not by it some vice, carying Euery vertue hath some vice annexed vnto it, which hath a resemblance of vertue. a show & a resemblāce of vertue. For wisedome hath vaine science bearing a show of true wisedome: Iustice hath crueltie; Fortitude rashnes; Liberality prodigality; Humilitie cowardice; Affability lightnes; hope presumption; zeale vnaduisednes; feare distrust; & so in the rest; so that as in all things as well artificiall as naturall there are found some true, and some seeming so, but are not so indeede: for there is both true gold and that which is false; lawfull money, and counterfet coyne;

true gemmes, and false gemmes: so also among vertues, some are true, and some that appeare to be so, but are not so in truth.
            This therefore is the greatest difficultie, which is found in the way of vertue, which is wont to minister matter of errour vnto yong beginners, and to those that are not well exercised: for many embrace vice for vertue, as we dayly see that men are deceiued, receiuing counterfet coyne for that which is true, by reason of the likenes it hath with it. This is that which the Apostle sayth; That the Angell of Sathan doth many times transforme himselfe into an Angell of light: for so doth he oftentimes deceiue vs, obtruding vice vnto vs. being coloured with a semblance of vertue. But as we sayd before, that as it is an euill thing for a man to withdraw

himselfe from the exercise of vertue, because he is fearefull to fall into vice: so also is it dangerous to desist from the duty of meditation: but the vices and dangers are rather to be feared, which may arise from this abstaining. For it is manifest, that there is not any state, nor any maner of liuing found in the world, which hath not some danger annexed vnto it: wherefore all our life may not vnfitly be called one danger and one continuall temptation Therefore least any man be blinded or deceiued of himselfe, it shall be profitable to shew as it were with a finger all kinde of dangers, deceipts, and impostures, and to admonish what is to be done in each of them
         
         
            
            THE FIRST ADMOnition of the dignitie and fruite of vocall prayer. CHAP. XLII.
            
            LEt this then be the first admonition: they that haue mentall prayer in estimation, let them take heed that they do not contemne vocall prayer, or reiect it as vnprofitable: because it is Whether vocall prayer differeth from mentall prayer. manifest, that for the very substance of the vertue, there is no difference betweene this and that prayer. For to call vpō God with the heart only, or with the heart and the mouth together, doth make nothing for the efficacie of prayer. For to adde to the voyce of the heart the voice of ye mouth, which God hath created, that he

may be praysed and glorified by it, how can it be, that it should derogate any thing from the dignitie of the work, or should import any essentiall difference? Euen as there is no essentiall difference betweene the confessions of him that speaketh, and him that writeth the same thing; so also prayer, which is a confession of the diuine praises, or (that I may speake more properly) a certaine petition of God for some necessary thing: whether this petition be made with inward words, or with outward, which are the images of internall things, there can be found no essentiall difference betweene this and that. This maner of praying is profitable to stir vp deuotion, and to inflame the heart, especially when it is lukewarme, & dispersed, and therfore vnfit by his own strength to fly or

to swim: for the sweet & deuout words, and the graue sentences, which are found in it, are very effectuall to do this, if they be repeated with humilitie and attention. For this cause the words of God are called fyre in the Scriptures; Why the words of God are called fire. for they haue vertue to warme our hearts, and to kindle in them the fyre of diuine loue. Furthermore, voyces haue (especially when diuine Psalmes are sung) a certaine naturall force to beget deuotion, as Saint Augustine testifieth, who hearing the melodious Psalmodye of the Church, sayth, that he was wonderfully inflamed within. Besides there are many men of that spirit and complexion, that they cannot for one momēt kepe their cogitatiōs fixed vpō God: for whom this manner of praying is most fitt, that by it (following the

sense and style of the words) they may attend in heart vpon God, and talke with him. For seeing that they cannot speake vnto him with their own words, and open their owne necessities vnto him with fit words, it is a very good help for them, if they be supported with the words of holy men, and that their spirit and deuotion be ruled by them, that by this manner they may more fitly declare their wants vnto God. In this place deuout Christians are to be put in minde, that making a prayer, they do it with as much deuotion and affection, as lieth in them: for hereupon depēdeth all the fruit & efficacy of prayer. For in the eares of God, as Bernard 
               Bernard in certaine 
                     •…
                  entences. saith, a vehement desire is a great clamour; but a remisse intent, is a submisse & low voice: for his ears are opē rather to the voice of the

heart, then to the voice of ye body.
            By this it may be vnderstoode how barren and fruitles the prayers of certaine men are, as wel ecclesiastical as temporal, who with such hast and swiftnes doe runne ouer their praiers, that they seeme not at all to talke with God. For they would not deale so vnaduisedly and coldly with men, if in good earnest they would obtaine any thing of them, for as Salomon saith, The poore speaketh with praiers; 
               Pro. 18. 
               but the rich answereth roughly. For he that plainely acknowledgeth his owne want and misery; & desireth seriously to be helped in his need; as he desireth it with all his heart, so he prayeth with al his heart, & with the Prophet calleth with strong crying, saying: I haue cryed with my whole heart, Lord heare me. I would to God that men would vnderstand and remember,

when they pray, to whome they speake, and what busines they haue in hand. For if they vnderstoode that they had speach with that supreame Maiesty, in whose presence the Angels tremble, and that they haue to deale with him about weighty and important busines, to wit, about the remission of sinnes and the saluation of their soules, their eyes would be opened, and they would see that it is vnseemely, yea that it is vniust that they should so negligently conferre with such a Lord about so great and weighty matters, and to speake to him after that manner, that they would not speake to a seruant, if they would haue him to regard that they say. These S. Bernard doth secretly reprehēd 
                  
                     •…
                  ernard in

                     •…
                  ntences. when he saith: This I say briefely, that certain, as I suppose, do somtimes

in their prayer feele a drynes, & a certaine dulnes of mind, that praying only with their lips, they do not marke what they say, nor to whome they speake; the reason is, because oftentimes they haue vsed so vnreuerētly to come vnto prayer without any care or premeditation. Therfore it behoueth vs to be vigilant in all our actions, but especially in our prayers: for albeit that euery hour, and in all places, as Bernard saith, the eies of the Lord do behold vs, yet Bernard in his epistles. most especially in prayer: for although we are always seene yet then especially when we speake vnto the Lorde, and shewe ourselues face to face. And in another place: It is a danger, if the In his 4 sermo
                     •…
                   of Lent. prayer be too feareful, but greater if it be rash; the third danger is, if it be luke warme, and not proceeding from a liuely affection.
            
               
Because a feareful prayer doth not pierce heauē; for immoderate feare doth pluck back the minde, that ye praier cannot ascend, much lesse pierce. A luke warme prayer doth languish and faile in the ascending, because it wanteth vigour. A rash praier ascendeth, but it reboundeth back againe, for it is resisted, neither doth it obtaine grace, but deserueth punishment: but that prayer which is faithfull, humble & feruent, without doubt shall pierce heauen, & shal not return empty. This saith he. But those that either will not pray at all, or that will not pray otherwise then we haue said, ye is, with too much haste, negligently & carelesly, let them not take it in ill part, that this is said vnto them: for by this meanes their coyne is become base, & the worth of it is diminished and not set by.
         
         
            
            THE SECOND ADmonition of the dignity and fruite of holy ceremonies, and of externall workes. CHAP. XXXXIII.

               hey are very profitable vnto vs, Ceremonies & externall reuerence are to be made account of.

               eing meanes to stir vp our hearts with a Deuotion & reuerence of Diuine things. For as our soule so 
                  •…
               ong as it continueth in this body 
                  •…
               oth conceiue of thinges by the

windows of the sences, by which they are presented: so it is a great helpe, that wee may worthily esteeme of diuine matters, to thinke reuerently of them, and to vse them in that maiesty and reuerent sort, that they are to be vsed in: for the garments, & royall robes, and great retinue, which the great states of this world vse, do moue men to such reuerence, that they regard them as kings and princes. For this cause that supreame Maiestie, and glorious Why christ did institute his Sacraments in visible things. Gouernour of the world, did institute & ordaine the Sacraments of his Church in visible things, that they might yeeld an inuisible grace. For euen as he instituted them for man, who is a creature mixt of body and soule; that is, compounded of a part visible, and a part inuisible: so also they are instituted, that they might instruct

vs, that the sight and presence of that which is seene, might stirre vp a deuotion & reuerēce of that, which is not seene.
            Furthermore all holy ceremonies, & externall exercises (besides that they are holy works, and proceeding frō vertue) are very conducent to get & preserue internal vertues. For euen as accidents do help much to ye preseruatiō of the substance (without which it cannot be preserued) so ceremonies & externall works do much help to the preseruation of charity and 
                  •…

                  •…
               reasure of our soules. After the same manner, because man is a treature consisting of soule & body it is meete that he serue God with both, bestowing his soule

For that gold is A Simily. not baser, which is found among coles, then that which is found among precious stones: neither is the medicine of lesser vertue, which is drunke out of a vessell of clay, then that which is drunke out of alabaster. Therefore the seruant of God ought not to despise the preacher, albeit he be a wicked man in his life, so long as he teacheth the word aright, for oftentimes God, who is the maister of them that be humble, doth bestow by their ministery gifts and graces vpon those that be

                ordinary way.
            It is true that for the determination of spirituall matters more time is required: for besides doctrine; charity, and the feare of God are necessary. For Science doth much illuminate, but much more charity, especially in spirituall matters, which together with the theory doe require a practise o

               and his tongue will talke of iudgement: for the law of his God is in his heart. And Ecclesiasticus sayth: The minde of a godly man 
               Eccles. 37. 
               doth sometimes shewe more truth, then seuen watchmen that sit aboue in an high towre. This hath place chiefely in spirituall matters, and particular causes. But for deciding of controuersies in matters of faith, for humane contracts, decrees, Ecclesiasticall commandements, and such like things, the doctors of ye
                Church, and maisters of those faculties do best know: and these spiritual matters are diligently to be examined, ye
                it may be seene, whether they agree with the rule of the diuine Scripture. To know other matters, let deuout men (as much as lyes in thē) seeke for learned men, and those of a good cōscience. For nothing in the world is more dangerous,

nor bringeth more harme, then knowledge without the feare of God: for where there is doctrine without this correction, there is pride and elation of spirit: but where there is pride, there is darkenes, ignorance, and diuine reprobation. From this fountaine all heresies present and past are bred, with infinite other euils and enormities of life. Wherefore the Wiseman sayth: Let them that bring peace be welcome vnto thee, but of a thousand haue but one counseller. When thou hast found such an one conferre with him of all thy matters, with humilitie and confidence: and do not euery day s

               eke for new maisters: for this oftentimes bringeth confusion, and it is a propertie of vnconstant men, and of those, that go about, seeking for fansies and opinions like their owne, neither

do they rest, till they haue found them; which being found, they say, that they are ruled by others aduice, when indeede they are ruled by their owne. By which it is manifest that it is no smal thing to know how to choose good councell, and perhaps of no lesser import and consequence, then to giue good councell.
         
         
            THE FOVRTH ADmonition, of the discretion which is required to the examination of good purposes. CHAP. XLV.
            
            THe fourth admonition not much differing frō the former, is; That although deuout

prayer is the fountaine of good desires: for there by reason of the consideration of the perfections and blessings of God, the fyre of charity burneth, from which the sparks of good desires arise: yet a man must not too much trust these desires, running headlong after all those things he desireth, not doing that before, which Iohn admonisheth, Beleeue not euery spirit, but try the spirits whether 
               1. Iohn. 4. 
               they are of God: for oftentimes vice is couered vnder vertue; oftentimes the wolfe playeth the theefe vnder a sheepes skin; and Sathan doth transforme himselfe into an Angell of light.
            Therefore we must know, that as nature, which hath giuen to man affections and appetites to the preseruatiō ofhis naturall life, hath also giuen him reason, that he may rule & moderate them (otherwise

they would endanger his life) so the holy Ghost, who stirreth vp spirituall desires in the righteous, to the preseruation of a spirituall life, doth adde also discretion, which may rule, examine and moderate those desires: that being so moderated, they may be rightly disposed vnto action. But because many spiritual mē do not this, oftentimes they take matters in hand which haue no good successe, whereby it is apparent, th
                  •…
               t they are deceiued; for they supposing their desire was good, thoght all things were now so safe, that they might finish although blindfolded, that they meditated vpon. Wherefore nothing is so necessary, as that a mā should now and then examine his good desires, and his zeale; the which by how much it hath a more beawtifull shew of good, by so much it may

more easily deceiue vnder the colour of good. For this cause God in the old testament would haue salt vsed in all the sacrifices, that he might intimate vnto vs, that the sacrifices of all our works ought to be seasoned with discretion. Wherefore the king of Persia, who commaunded all things to be giuen vnto the Israelites 1. Esd. 7. in weight and measure, which pertained vnto the building & furn
                  •…
               shing of the temp'e; commanded, that salt should be giuen vnto them without measure, for the great vse and neede of it: seeing that in all our works we haue neede of the salt of discretion. For seeing that it is the eye of our soule, wee cannot conueniently moue a foote without it.
         
         
            
            THE FIFT ADMONItion, that together with prayer, a man ought to be exercised in all other vertues. CHAP. XLVI.
            
            THe louer of deuotion is fiftly to be admonished, that although prayer be an excellent vertue (for by it we obtaine the spirit of God, & his grace, which is the fountaine of all our blessings; and with it many vertues do concurre, as we sayd before) yet for all this a man must not so desist and leaue off, but he must also bestow his strength & might to compasse other vertues, as wel that he may satisfie his duty, to

which he is bound, as that by litle and litle he may get an habit of them. For although the feruour of charity is a great pricke vnto deuotion: yet notwithstāding this feruour being somewhat slacked, which oftentimes comes to passe, forth with naturall appetites & affections do arise, and begin to lift vp their heads, vnlesse they be bridled by the continuall exercise of vertue, so yt
                they headlong cast a mā into many infirmities & debilities. Therefore it is necessary, that besides the helpe we haue of prayer, that we be also ayded of the actes & exercises of vertue, yt
                by vse and continuance in them, by litle and litle we may get vnto vs an habit, and so the affections and perturbations of our minde may be restrained, that we may haue the exercise of vertue not only for the delight of Deuotion,

but also that by the customary vse of vertue, passiōs may be subdued.
            But if a man in the execution of these works, especially in ye
                works of mercy be somtimes distracted and disturbed, and as it were forsaken of the spirit, let him not for this discourage himselfe, neyther let him thinke, that he hath lost any thing in this busines, or that he shall bring forth greater fruite in an other exercise: as many thinke, who know not in what thing true vertue consisteth, both because it is not to be maruelled at, if we be troubled being distracted with many businesses: and also, because that which is sweete, is not alwayes wholesome, yea many times the contrary happeneth. For we see that it doth no lesse profit the sicke to eate with A Simily. loathing and abhorring, then it doth the sound to feede with

appetite and stomacke: neither is a purging medicine, although bitter, lesse profitable then other meate, although it be sweete.
            They are much deceiued, that do iudge of the dignity of works by the taste, and by the sweetnes: and it oftentimes hapneth that such do not worke for that end, that they ought to worke for, that is, that the will of God might be done, but that their owne may be done: not that they might loue and seeke God, but that they might seeke themselues. Oftentimes I had rather haue the distraction and drynes of the obedient, then the attention of certaine deuout men: for that is wont for the most part to be alwayes most secure, which is bitter, and contrary to our will. Thou oughtest not here to be afraide; for oftentimes some defects are wont to

            That this may be vnderstood the better, we must note, that Frō whēce the consolations of the Spirit arise. these spirituall ioyes and consolations are deriued from three causes. For sometimes they proceede from the holy Ghost, as we haue saide before, who by this meanes would weane men from the world, & giue them strength to ouercome the difficulties of vertue. Sometimes they arise from the noblenes of the studies, and matters, which we handle and thinke vpon: such were the delights of the Philosophers, whē they meditated vpon the variety, might, and arte of things created, and from hence ascended to th

                seperated substances, in which (as Aristotle saith) are found exceeding delights, and that by

reason of the dignity and noblenes of such things. And so there are many, that meditating vpon the workes of God, as well of grace, as of nature: or reading the holy Scriptures, and the bookes of the Doctors of the Church, do take great delight and pleasure in them. For, as the things

For otherwise wee receiue the giftes of God not to our profit, but to iudgement and condemnation; if we contemne our neigh bour.
            Furthermore we must consider All men are one body. that the church of Christ is a most perfect body, in which there are diuerse members, euery one in differing in figure and office: yet all necessary for the ministery and ornament of the body. For it is necessary, that in the mistical body of the Church there be variety of members: that is, of diuerse 
                  •…
               tates and offices, that there may

               spiritsmight be signified which

                  •…
               ast vnto a happy life, but euery

one by his seuerall way. For euen A Simily. as from the circumferēce of a circle there are many lines tending to the center: so there are many waies by which Christ leadeth his to heauen, which is the common center of euery ones selicitie.
            Wherfore Christ leadeth some to this center by the way of praier & meditation: others by the way of preaching: others by the way of patience in aduersity; others by abstinence; many by pouerty, some by humility: some by the works of mercy: & others by other waies, al which leade & direct to one & the selfe same place.
            Which seeing it is so, why dost thou perswade thy selfe that thy way is better & safer thē 
               ye
                way of others? who hath giuen thee this security? If it be God alone yt
                weigheth spirits, & searcheth hearts, who hath put the ballāce into thy

hands, to weigh thē, as thouthinkest good, & to make thine end heuier when thou pleasest? or who hath placed thee in this chaire, to giue such iudgement? That man is not so feruent in praier, as thou art; yet neuerthelesse, it may be (although no man hath made thee his iudge) that he is more patient, more humble, and more obedient then thou art; and that he hath more charity, and more mercy, then thou hast: and so he may excell thee in other vertues, which are more laudable.
            He doth not weep so oft, as thou weepest: neyther doth he feele, that thou feelest. And doest thou knowe whence these teares spring, and whence this feeling is? for although commonly wee say that they are of God, yet it may bee, that they are of an other spyritte:

it may be that they are rather of nature, then of grace: that is, they may rather flow from the tendernes, and soft constitution of the hart, then from the spirit of God. Furthermore although they proceed frō this spirit, yet the height of perfection consisteth not in them; but they are onely instruments of perfection: the victory of the battaile is not placed in these,, but they are weapons to obtaine it: our saluation lyeth not in them, but they are meanes vnto saluation.
            For the good of man cōsisteth not in the instruments, & in preparations destined vnto it, but in their good vse. It were ridiculous, if any one should say, that hee that hath eaten more then others, will also digge and delue more then others: for it may be, that be that hath eaten lesse, may labor more;

seeing that the one doth not of necessity follow the other. After the same manner Prayer & that comfort that God sendeth, are destined and ordred to compasse the loue of God; yet there be many, that vse not this fauour well, and that abuse the water giuen them to refresh the plantes of vertue, to the cherishing and fostring of their owne delights: that is, that turne and conuert the comforts and graces, which they haue receiued, by which they should further grow in loue with God, to their owne recreation and loue of themselues.
            We ought to iudge no man, much lesse Ecclesiasticall persons, who liue in the professiō of vertues. For the contēpt of thē doth engender in the soule a worme so hurtful & dangerous, that it doth not onely gnaw their persons, but also their

office & ministery, which is ye
                soū
               taine and spring of many euilles. Neither must we publish, or boast of in the market place the faultes and offences of our brethren, yea albeit we see thē, being mindefull of that curse of Noah, which he inflicted vpon his sonne, because he would not couer the nakednes of his father: but rather let vs follow the reuerence of the other two brethren, who discreetly, and with honor couered it. That great Emperour Constantine had thys spirit, amongst whose prayses, An excellēt saying of Cōstantine this especially is numbred, that he said: If I should take a Preacher or a minister of Gods word in any crime, I would couer him with my cloake, that he might be seene of none. This is properly called zeale, and the spirit of Christ: but to triumph, geere, scoffe, and disdaine, when any

of the seruants of God falleth, this is proper vnto Antichrist, whome all follow, that are his members.
            Neyther for ones fault, or for the fault of a few, are all straightwayes to bee condemned: for this was palpable and grosse ignoraunce; as if for twoo or three women, which seemed A Simily. good, and afterwardes were taken in adulterye, one should say that all married women are adulteresses.
            They that liue without the fleshe, are alwayes eyther good, or euill: they alwayes stand, or fall: but they that abide yet in the flesh, sometimes fall, and after rise againe. Ifin heauen, in Paradice, in the schoole of Christ, & in the colledge of the seuen Deacons of the church elected of ye
                Apostles there was one that fell, & became

disobedient, who sold his Master, and failed in the faith: is it any maruell, if a like thing be sound in other states and congregations? The fault of them that fal from so high places, doth not diminish, but encrease their dignity, that perseuere and continue in them.
         
         
            THE SEVENTH ADmonition, that all kinde of singularity is to be auoided. CHAP. XLVIII.
            THe seuenth admonitiō is, that a Deuout man so liue, that as much as lyeth in him he make no vaine shew of his deuotion, and that he studiously endeuour himself, that he may eschew all kinde

of singularity, as well in his apparell, as in his other actions without offence to God; according to the counsell of Seneca writing vnto his friend; Looke, saith he, that thy exteriour figure bee common with other men: but that thine interiour habit may differ from them.
            To this admonition it appertaineth, A secret place to pray in is to be chosen. Math. 6. that the place of praier be such an one, as our Sauiour sheweth, when he saith; But when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber: and when thou hast shut thy doore, pray vnto thy Father which is in secret, & thy Father which seeth in secret, shal reward thee openly. This I say, 
                  •…

yet there are some, for whome a secret place is more fit to pray in thē a publicke place: by reason of the danger of vain glory, & singularity. A secret place remoued frō the eies of the world is a safe hauē for yong men & yong maides. Let deuout mē make oratories of corners, & let them there worship God in spitit and truth.

               ed: for it is one thing to take

away the necessity, and an other thing to pare away the superfluity. For this hath the Church thought good, this the Saintes haue taught, and amongst them Saint Hierome who in his Epistles doth often commend the Solitarines of women.
            For this cause these persons ought alwaies to vse great discretion When and how often we are to cōmunicate in frequenting the holy communion. For albeit the Christians in the primitiue Church did dayly communicate: yet this example is not now foorth with to be followed, because then it was no note of singularity, to do that, which all did: as it is no note of singularity to bee cloathed with a white garment in that place, where all are arrayed in the same colour. This Sacrament is to be receiued at such tymes, as the Church hath appoynted:

let some come euery moneth, others euery weeke, as Augustine counsaileth, some seldome, some oftner, according to occasions, or the desire of him that would communicate, or according to the age, deuotion and state of euery one.
            This admonition especially belongeth vnto women, of a suspected age for vaine-glory and singularity, although neither for these, nor for any other so generall a rule can be giuen, which doth admit no exception.
         
         
            
            THE EIGHT ADMOnition is, that too much familiaritie as well of men, as of women, is to be eschewed. CHAP. XLIX.
            THe eight admonition is, that with all endeuour we flye from the too much familiaritie as well of men, as of women: yea, although they be religious and spirituall: for it often commeth to passe, as one saith, that spiritual loue is changed into carnal loue, for the similitude and likenes of the one with the other.
            This is very often, and very seriously beat vpon by the holy Fathers.

S. Augustine sayth: I dare boldly say, that he that will not Aug de cohabitatione clericorum & mulierum, sets de singulari. clericorum. eschew familiarity to conuerse with women, shal without doubt at the length fall. And in another place; Chastity is consorted with a grieuous companyon, whome we must not only resist, but letting the bridle go, fly from as far as we can. Neither are women lesse to be eschewed, because they seeme religious: because by how much they are more religious, by so much the more they do sooner allure, and vnder the pre

or Hierome. And a little after: what great Bishops, and what excellent Clerkes, after many fiery trials, and victorious combats, after many wonderfull things done by them, are knowen to haue ship wracked with them all, when they woulde sayle in a slender barke? What mighty and strong Lyons hath this one delicate infirmity (that is, luxury) tamed: which being vilde, base, & wretched, yet maketh pray of great things.
            Saint Hierome doth agree vnto this: Sayth he, either be indifferently Hierome in an Epist. to Nepot. ignorant of all the may des and virgins of Christ, or els indifferently and equally loue them: neither haue affiance and confidence in thy fore passed chastitie; for thou canst not be more holy then Dauid, nor more wise then Salomon.

Otherwise the Bridegrome will not sleepe with thee in one bed, especially in that, which for the flowers of obedience thou bestrawest with hemlock & brambles. For which he wil not heare thy prayers; neither will he come when thou callest him.

for delight, or for honour, or recreation, or for to get greater authoritie, or for any such ende.

            The Apostle very well vnderstoode this, and willeth to preuent it, writing vnto Titus, and commanding him, that he should be instant in season, and out of season, that he should admonish euery one to doo their duties. And when as now he was come vnto maryed women, he sayth: Exhort the young women to be sober minded, that they loue their

               husbands, that they loue their children, that they be discreete, chast, keeping at home, good and subiect vnto their husbands, that the word

of God be not euill spoken of. Thou seest in this Chapter, how plainely the Apostle doth warne euery one of his duty, propounding vnto thē not only what they should do, that is, to haue a care of their house &c. but also from what they should abstaine, that is, that the word of God be not euill spoken of, and that their neighbour should not be scandalized, &c. which is done, as often as any one offendeth in those things, which belong vnto his duty.

ouraffections, and the subduing of our owne wills. For the end of this life is loue and charity, and of this loue is bred a generall obedience of all the diuine commandements, and a perfect conformitie of our wills with the diuine will; which Christ testifyeth plainely in the Gospell, saying: If any man loue me, he will keepe 
               Iohn. 14. 
               my word, and my Father will loue him, and we will come vnto him, and will dwell with him. And a little before; He that hath my commandemēts, and keepeth them, is he that loueth me. Hence it is, that perfect loue and perfect obedience seeme to be one and the selfe same thing: for he that loueth, cannot but do that, which he commandeth, whome he loueth; but he that hateth, con

               emneth the precepts of him, whome he hateth.
            
               
Therefore to this kinde of obedience, mortification, and the deniall of our owne will before all things is required. For euen as a A Simily. yong set or slip cannot be grafted into a tree, vnlesse first that branch be cut off, into whose place it is to be inserted: so the diuine will cannot be grafted into our heart, vnlesse first our owne will be lopped away; for these two wills are contrary one to the other. This is the function of mortification, The duty 
                     〈◊〉
                   mortification is to kill and subdue our owne will. and the vse of morall vertues, which are especially conuersant about this. For the greater part of them consisteth in this, that they may restraine some one of these passions, that they may make way for the actions of vertue, in which the obseruance of the diuine law consisteth. By all which it followeth, that the ende of this whole busines is loue, obedience,

and the mortification of al our euill affections: as in very few words Ecclesiasticus teacheth, saying; The children of wisedome are the Church of the righteous, & their 
               Eccesi. 3. 
               of-spring is obedience and loue. By which wordes he signifieth, that the chiefe fruites of righteousnes are two: for the first begotten child is the loue of God, of which is bred obedience vnto his will: the which that we may satisfie, it is needfull that our owne bee denyed, which is the proper duety and function of mortification. For which cause all the Saints haue made an especial account of mortification: for it is the first gate and entraunce vnto all other vertues.
            This is that crosse, which our Sauiour so greatly commendeth in the Gospell, vpon which all our inordinate affections are to

be crucified, as al they haue done, and doe, of whome the Apostle speaketh; They that are Christes, 
               Gal. 5. 
               haue crucified the flesh with the affections and the lustes.
            
            Seeing therfore that this crosse is of so great weight and momēt, and so abhorred and hated of our flesh: and seeing that those things which are so hard and difficult, cannot bee performed without great strength and fortitude: and seeing that vnsauery relishes cannot be got downe without some sauery sauce, therfore praier is ordained, in which both things are found. For by prayer wee obtaine What we obtaine by prayer. fortitude and courage to fight against Amalech our enemy: & by prayer the diuine grace is bestowed vpon vs, which alone can do al things: in it charity is kindled and exercised, which is the mother of all vertues, & by this our eyes are

daily more & more opened vnto the diuine knowledge: to be brief in it the ioy of the holy Ghost is cōmunicated vnto vs, by which the way of the Lord is made most pleasant and sweet vnto vs: according to that of the Prophet; I will run the way of thy commandements 
               Psal. 119. 
               when thou shalt enlarge mine heart.
            
            For this cause prayer is so exceedingly commended of all the Saints: not onely for that, which it is in it selfe (although it be an especiall acte of Religion) but also, and that cheefly, for the great helpe and ayde it bringeth to them that endeuor to the foresaid end.
            So that it is not so praised and Praier is not th'end but a mea

If any man therefore should be frequent in prayer, and yet dissolute and lose in manners, neyther endeuour himselfe vnto vertuous actions, hee should not much differ from one that is sicke and vnsound, who alwaies vseth medicines, and yet is neuer the better, but still continueth in the same infirmity: he is wretched & miserable after a double manner; first by reason of the griefe & vexation of the infirmity, & secondly because of the continuall horrour and annoyance of the medicines.
            This is a principle and an axiome generall and true: by which any one may easily vnderstād the sundry errours, which are wont to be committed in this respect. For

that which is difficult, and embrace that which is easie: they reiect that which is bitter, and take that which is sweete, & they so giue themselues wholy to praier, that they make small account of mortification.
            For mans heart is greedy and desirous of any pleasure, so that some Philosophers did not blush to affirme; That pleasure was the The Epicures. last end, and center of humane felicitie: But all other affirmed, that it is the baite of al euils, for by the desire of pleasure very many doe cast themselues headlong into all vices & enormities. What? is mans appetite so powerfull, that as water A Simily. of his owne naturall motion doth alwaies slide & drop downwards, and if any one desireth to hinder that passage, he profitteth nothing for it will seeke for some corner or chinke, which it may

breake through: so also our heart is alwaies ready bent to all kinde of pleasure, so that if silence bee imposed vpon it, & any one thing be denyed vnto it; foorth with it swelleth & rageth, now winding it self this way, now ye
                way, seeking for a vent, & neuer resteth, vntil it hath satisfied the lust. Therfore it is very well said of a certaine Nature is subtill. Doctor, that nature is subtill, and in all things seeketh her selfe: yea in those men, that are more perfect and Diuine.
            And rightly he calleth her subtill, because with great modestie, so that she is not perceiued, shee entreth where she listeth: and insinuateth her selfe, whether she is not called; that she may search, if she may finde ought, that may bee either pleasant or profitable vnto her, which she may enioy, or which she may rest in.
            
               
Hence the greater part of errors arise, which are wont to meete with vs in this way. Hence first ariseth the corruption of the intent of the good works we do: the onely and principall ende of which is God: our sensuall appetite doth contrary and gaine-say this ende, which alwaies seeketh something, wherein to delight it selfe. And this is a principall and a cheefe thing, that doth corrupt al our workes, and causeth, that the Water is not altogether pure.
            Hence it is that many liue in errour, thinking that they haue done many good workes, in the ministery of the Lord: which when they come to be examined at the strict iudgement of God, it presently & plainly appeareth, ye it was not pure gold, ye they brought, but mingled with drosse, and

full of the mud of theyr owne loue.
            From this fountain it also spingeth, that many in the exercises of prayer, of reading, & meditation, &c. do hunt after nothing els, but delight, and a certaine spirituall ioy, and in this they place the height of their desire: perswading themselues, because it is a spirituall delight, that they are now in a safe hauen, and that there cannot remaine any daunger, but in a carnall delight, they doe not marke, that selfe loue, that spirituall gluttony, coueteousnes, and such like affections, may also haue place heere, as a certaine Doctor saith: & perhaps so much the more, as these delightes are greater, and more desired.
            At the least this is certaine, that the roote of all this euill is the loue of our selues, which hath an

eye alwaies vnmoueably fastned vpon priuate commodity & selfe gaine: whether it be in this matter, or in that: that is, whether the commodity be of delight, or

I answere, that they are too many, who are thus deceiued: for we see by experience, that many are so tyed to this study and exercise, that if at any time a worke of charity, or of corporall trouble be offered vnto them, presently they shrinke backe, and rather impose it vpon any other, then they will vndergoe it themselues. And this is a manifest signe, that such doe not purely and simply seeke for the good pleasure and will of God. For when that offereth it selfe, which they know to be pleasing vnto God, they turne themselues from it, and turne vnto that which is pleasing and pleasant vnto themselues: none otherwise, then if nothing was acceptable vnto God, but that which was also gratefull vnto men: when as in a manner the contrary is alwaies true, that that doth lesse please

men, which is most gratefull vnto God.

They are merry & do seeke to fare deliciously, to liue daintily, to eate and drinke of the best, to cloath their body sumptuously, & to vse themselues effeminately; yet neuerthelesse for all

they could not weepe in prayer: and they most plentifully powre foorth teares, not teares of deuotion, but of impatience. And such, as for this cause doe weepe, doe not shed teares because they see themselues ful of anger, pride, coueteousnes, selfe loue, and many other vices, & destitute of humility, charity, and other vertues, more necessary then those teares are.
            And this errour doth so farre exceede, that some of them haue their Deuotion in such regard and reckoning, that they eyther neglecte, or contemne true righteousnes, to the which notwithstanding they are bound by the diuine law. They think that they haue most greeuously offended, if they doe not euery day heare diuine seruice; if that euery day they doe not make an end o

those prayers, they haue appointed vnto themselues, and so satisfie the calender of their deuotion, which if they haue not done, they can neyther eate nor drinke quietly; when as in the meane time they can sleep soundly and sweetly, hauing their coffers and chestes stuft full of rich garments and rustie coyne, neuer considering that there are so many poore and naked, which perish and faint through hunger and cold. Their conscience full of faults & crimes doth not take away their sleepe, neither doth it hinder their rest, although it be clogged with the burdens of many debts, which they are able to repay, but do not. And also whē as they haue not for many yeres saluted their neighbor by reason of an inueterate hate to the great scandall of much people: neyther haue regarded

those things, which belonged to their estate, and vnto the conditiō of their family, yet for al this they haue securely slept, & not any whit haue bin trobled or disturbed for it. And yet if any of these things do offer themselues vnto them, especially if they haue any trouble, or difficulty annexed vnto them; they vtterly reiect them, pull backe theyr handes, and say; that by this labour theyr heart is distracted, and their Deuotion hindred; which is none other thing, then to forsake the heade for the feete: for they make more account of the quiet of theyr heart, which disposeth vnto praier, then of the obedience of the Diuine law, vnto which prayer is disposed.
            It is likely that such men neuer read that of our Sauiour; Not euery one that saith vnto mee, Lord, 
               Math. 7.
               
               Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doth my Fathers will which is in heauen.
            
            This Deuotion without the foundation of righteousnes is one of the principall and most vniuersall errors, that are wont to meet with man in this way, for it altogether destroyeth a spirituall life in euery body. For whereas the end of this life is the fulfilling of the diuine law, and the meanes, by which we attaine this ende is prayer (as we haue often said) this errour without question peruerteth this order; for of the end it maketh a meane, & of the meane, maketh the end, & so it confoundeth all things.
            I would to God that they were very few, who in this respecte were deceiued: But I feare, seeing that the kingdome of selfe loue is very large, least also the

plague, which springeth from it, be very generall; albeit in some one respect it expatiateth more, then in another: yet few there be, that are altogether free from it.
            Neyther let any one thinke that this Doctrine is contrary vnto that, which before we haue deliuered, as concerning the too much busines in externall matters: for that doth rebuke them that altogether forsake the exercise of prayer, that they may attend vpon exteriour labours: and this that wee haue heer said, is contrary to the other extreame, and doth blame them, that so giue themselues to prayer, that they will not entermeddle with any externall busines, although it be very necessary. Both of these are extreames, which vertue doth alwaies abhorre, consisting in 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
meane.
            For our businesses ought not to be so many and so great, as to choake our prayer; nor our prayer ought to be in such esteeme, that for it the workes of vertue be neglected, which are proper vnto our estates and callings.
         
         
            OF A REMEDY MOST profitable and avayleable against all these kindes of errors. CHAP. LII.
            
            HE therefore that would be freed from all these errors, let him set downe vnto himselfe the last end of all his labours and troubles to bee the keeping

of the law of God, and the obseruing of his moste holy will, and also the mortifying of hys owne will: let him vse the sweetnes of prayer to temper & qualifie the cup of bitternes, and let him assuredly perswade himself, that by how much the more any one drinketh of this cup, by so much hee hath profitted; and by how much lesse any one hath drunke of it, by so much he hath lesse profitted.
            Let him diligently marke, how much hee dayly profitteth in humility, as well in that which is inward, as in that which is outward: how he brooketh the iniuries, that are done vnto him: how he succourerh the infirmities of others, & releeueth the necessities of his neighbor; how he hath a fellow feeling of his brethrens miseries; how he reproacheth not

the escapes & falles of his neighbor: and how he hath learned to hope in the Lord, when tribulations are at hand; how he moderateth his tongue, keepeth his heart, bridleth the flesh with al her lusts & concupisences, how he gouerneth & ordreth himselfe, as well in aduersity as in prosperity, that he be not cast downe of the one, nor puffed vp of the other. How he carrieth himselfe in all thinges with grauity and discretion. But before all thinges let him diligently consider, whether the loue of honour, of pleasure, of the worlde, and of such like affections bee killed and mortified in him, and according to the rule, that euery one shall finde in himselfe, let him so iudge: and not according to the quantity of sweetnes, which he shall feele in prayer.
            
               
But if we would attaine vnto Mortification is necessarie. our true end indeed, it ought not to be sufficient vnto vs, to haue looked vnto prayer: but it is also requisite, that with one eye, and that with the best, we haue a regard vnto mortification, and with the other vnto prayer. If we will doe this, at the length wee shall come vnto true contemplation. Otherwise prayer will profit nothing without mortification: neither can perfect mortification be had, without the help of prayer.
            For prayer and mortification are as two sisters, one of which doth help the other in all thinges, that are to be done.
            Which two vertues were figured The two Alters in the temple of salomon what they signifie. and pointed at by those two Alters, that were in the temple of Salomon; vpon one of which, sacrifices were alwayes offered;

and vpon the other nothing but incense.
            By the Alter of Sacrifice, on which diuerse liuing creatures were daily killed and sacrificed, mortificatiō is vnderstood, whose duety it is, to sacrifice and cut off the heades of our appetites: By the Alter of incense, prayer is meant, which like incense kindled by the Diuine loue, doth ascend out of our hearts euen vp to heauen, & there doth deale with God about the dispatch of our busines.
            He therefore that after this manner desireth to bee the Temple of the liuing God, let him haue in his Soule these twoo Alters: one is his superiour part, where alwayes may fume the incense of prayer, and meditation, that that of the Psalmographer may be fulfilled:
            
               
               O how loue I thy law, it is my 
               Psal. 119. 
               meditation continually. The other in his inferiour part, where alwaies hee may offer Sacrifices of his concupiscences and appetites; that that of the Apostle may bee done; Mortifie your members which are on the earth, fornication, and vncleannesse, inordynate 
               Colos 3. 
               affection, euill concupiscence and coueteousnes which is idolatrie.
            
            This is that myrrh, of which the Spouse speaketh in the Canticles: I will goe, saith shee, into the mountaine of myrrh, and to 
               Cant. 4. 
               the hill of incense.
            
            For as by incense prayer is vnderstoode, so by myrrh mortification is meant: which is most bitter vnto our taste, but most precious in the sight of God, and of moste acceptable sauour. Neyther doth it want a mistery,

that myrrh is attributed to the mountaine, and incense to the hill: perhaps that it might be insinuated, how mortification is farre more excellent then prayer, as well in difficulty, as in dignity. For as an vniuersall mortifying of all our appetites is more difficult Mortification is difficult. then prayer, so also it is more excellent and more necessary. And as the hill is the way vnto the mountaine, and the meanes to ascend vnto it, so prayer is the way, and the ascending to mortification. Therefore the seruant of God is to be admonished, that the more sweetnes he feeleth in prayer, the more cheerfully he prepare himselfe vnto greater troubles: considering that 
                  •…
               t is meete and requisite, that he suffer for that Lord, by whom he hath bene dealt with so louingly & so tenderly: and let him weigh

and marke that these consolatiōs which are giuen vnto him, are but breathings bestowed vpon him to this end, that with greater courage he may returne into the field.
            And we are faithfully to marke and consider, that at that very Christ in the glory of his trāsfiguration did speake of his passion. time, when the Lord was transfigured vpon the mount, when his face did shine like the Sunne, and his garments were as white as snow: I say that at that very time, in the midst of so great ioyes he spake of those things, which afterwards he was to suffer at Ierusalem. What? had the busines of his passion any fellowship or participation with his transfiguration? If musick be vnseasonable in the time of mourning; shall not mourning in like manner be vnseasonable in the time of musicke, and publ

Truly this hath place at the feasts and meetings of this world; but not in diuine solemnities, where consolations are giuen for tribulations: rest for torment; and for the crosse transfiguration. So that as often as the seruant of God feeleth any comfort, let him assuredly know, that he is cited, and prouoked vnto a new combat: and as these consol
                  •…
               tions doe binde a man vnto tribulations; so wee must thinke, that wee are called vnto tribulations, as often as wee feele that wee are comforted. Therefore as a diligent and carefull tr

is about his iourney: so also the seruant of God, when he goeth to pray, let him on the one side enioy celestiall sweetnes, and on the other side let him purpose to beare troubles and molestations for his loue, of whome he is so much made of, and who will not haue any one to eate his bread, but in the sweate of his face.
            Let this then be the ende and scope of this busines; that before all things we write in our hearts these wordes of our Sauiour: If any man will come after me, let him deny himselfe, and take vp his crosse 
               Luke. 9. 
               dayly, and follow me. And because this crosse can hardly be taken vp, vnlesse we be helped by the fortitude and alacrity of prayer: therefore we betake our selues to this vertue, as to a most faithfull guide, which doth bring vs to this ende. Therefore that we desire,

is not denyed vnto vs, but graunted: and God doth bestow

that for this he shall be disobedient to God, if he shut all his gates against all such things: for God knoweth, if he at any time will reueale any thing vnto man, how to finde an entrance, and to open his gates after that manner, that he cannot doubt, but certainely know, that God is present. So he dealt with Samuel being yet a childe, when he called him once, 1. Reg. 3. twice, and the third time: and he told him all things, that he would haue him to know, so manifestly, that not any scruple remained vnto him, neither could he doubt of his embasie.

            THE FOVRTEENTH admonition, that sometimes we must pray longer, then at other some. CHAP. LVI.
            
            VVE sayd before that the seruant of God ought to set downe vnto himselfe certaine times to pray in, as we reade that Daniell did in times past, Dan. 6. who thrice a day prayed vpon his knees.
            That Dauid did the like, it is manifest by that which hee sayeth; In the euening and morning, 
               Psal. 55. 
               and at noone day will I pray, and that instantly, and he shal heare my voyce. Now let vs adde

besides the ordinary time of euery day, that a man ought at certaine howres, (all other busines set apart, although it be spirituall) wholy to giue himselfe vnto prayer and meditation, and that more plentifull foode bee bestowed vpon the soule, to repayre that, which was consumed by dayly defects, and that strength may be gotten to proceede further. For as the children of this world besides their A Simily. dayly repast, haue their extraordinary feastes and bankets, in which they are wont to exceede the manner of other refections: so it is also behoouefull, that the righteous besides theyr dayly prayer haue their feasts and spirituall bankets, in which theyr soules may feede not measurably (as at other times) but may be filled and stuffed with the diuine

sweetenes, and with the plenty of Gods house.
            We see that nature is not content with the deaw, that in the A Simily. night time falleth vpō the earth, but also now and then it rayneth, and that plentifully, not for a weeke, but oftentimes longer; for so it is necessary, that the heauens should be now and then more liberall towardes the earth, and should so glut it, that neither the sunne, nor the winde may make it dry: So also our soule besides the common and dayly deaw, ought to haue certayne peculiar tymes, in which our eyes may do none other thing, then showre downe most plentifull teares of deuotion; by which our soule may be so filled with the vertues and iuyce of the holy Ghost, that all the tribulations, and all the windes of

this world may not dry it.
            Albeit this course is lawdable at any time, yet especially at the chiefe solemnities and feasts of the yeare: neyther is it lesse necessarye in the time of trouble, or after deliuerance from some offence, or after disturbance in some ouerth wart busines, then the recreation and refection of the body is necessary after long infirmitie. For otherwise a man cannot turne vnto himselfe, nor be renewed, vnlesse he bestow as much time vpon his returne into the way, as he spent, when he went out of the way: especially seeing that wee knowe that Deuotion is of the nature of those things, which are easily lost, but being lost, are hardly recouered.
            Of what weight this busines is, no man can easily declare; for

it may be that at one of these times greater giftes and graces may be receiued, then at any other time. And according to the iudgement of the diuines, any one act done with feruour, and earnest zeale, doth more increase charity, then many done with numnes and feeblenes. If this haue place in other actes of vertue, certainely it shall also haue place in prayer, which doth more traffick with God by the way of mercy, then by the way of iustice: and therefore it may be so feruent and so zealous, that it may obtaine more in one day, then that which is feeble and dull can obtaine in many. Such was the prayer of Sara the wife of Sara, the wife of Tobias. Tob. 3. 
               Tobias, who for three dayes and three nights, did neither eate nor drinke, but continuing in prayer, intreated the Lord with teares.

The third day, when she perceiued that her prayer was heard, she gaue thanks vnto God for her deliuerance. Yet it is credible that shee prayed oftentimes before, and requested the same things, at the hands of God (for it is a most vsuall custome among the righteous to runne vnto God in all their tribulations) but then especially her prayers entred into the presence of the glory of the great God. For long instance and harty perseuerance in prayer, doth adde force and heate vnto it▪ by which it is lifted vp into heauen.

            THE FIFTENTH ADmonition, of the discretion, that ought to be vsed in the exercise of prayer. CHAP. LVII.
            
            THere be some that want iudgment and discretion in their exercises; for when as all thinges betweene them and God haue prosperours successe; this prosperity at the length becommeth offenciue vnto them, and bringeth

an occasion of great daungers.
            For there be some vpon whom graces seeme to bee bestowed with a full hand: these feeling the fellowship of the Lord so sweet and pleasant, do so drowne themselues in this exercise, and doe so long continue in prayer, in watching, and in other corporall asperityes, that at the length theyr naturall strength doth fayle them.
            Hence it is that many are troubled with fayntnesse and weaknesse of stomacke, others are payned with the head ache, others are diseased with the Megram, and swimming of the braine: by which diseases they are so afflicted, that they become vnfit not onely for corporall exercises, but also to pray. Therefore it is meet & requisite, that things be

considered of in the beginning,

            For I haue knowen many, sayth hee, who after they had lost their health by such manner of exercise, afterwards going about to refreshe and recouer themselues, and seeking to ridde themselues of this languorment of bodye, haue come to that passe, that afterwards they haue liued not onely more delicately, but also more dissolutely. Therfore to eschew this danger, it is better euery day to proceed a little, and softly to goe from the lesse to the greater, and so to come to perfection; then by little

                  eth God, hath a care of all thinges: as well of small things, as of great: for smal things by little and little bring vnto great, neyther can small things be preserued without great.
            Therefore the seruant of God ought not only 
                  •…
               o regard one vertue alone, althogh it be great: but he must regard all together: for as one string in a Lute doth not make musick, but alltogether: so

one vertue alone is not sufficient to make this spirituall harmony, but all must sound together. And although all these vertues (as we haue said) are profitable and avayleable vnto this our present purpose, yet more particularly the keeping of the hart and sences; the composition and right ordering of the exteriour man, temperance in eating, drinking and speaking are conducent; and all the other (of which we haue spoken before) doe help deuotion: and he that hath not care of these, shall neuer come vnto perfect praier.
         
         
            
            THE SEVENTENTH admonition, that this exercise is not to be taken for an Arte, or vsed as an Arte, but to be done with great humility and confidence. CHAP. LIX.
            
            THe louer and embracer of Deuotion is also in this place to be admonished, that all that hath hetherto beene spoken to stirre vp Deuotion, is as a preparatiue to prepare man to receiue the diuine grace: by casting away all trust in his owne strength and merits, and by reposing it in God alone.
            
               
I say this; because there are many men, who of all these rules and instructions do make an arte, supposing, that as he that learneth an arte, if he will obserue his rules, becommeth a cunning workmā: so also they thinke that hee, that well obserueth these our rules, shall obtaine that hee desireth by the vertue of them: not marking, that this is nothing else, then to make an arte of grace, and to attrybute that to the rules of humane arte, which is the pure gift and mercy of the Lord.
            The Doctrines of certaine spirituall bookes written as well in prose, as in verse, haue giuen occasion of this error: which do so exceedingly commend their rules and their manner of teaching, that some thinke, that by the benefit of them, they may obtain

that they desire. None otherwise then an Alchimist, teaching to A Simily. make chimicke gold, who reacheth to his scholler this or that minerall, and sayth thou shalt thus and thus prepare it, and by and by thou shalt haue pure gold: so these men say, doe this and that, speake after this manner and after that, and by and by thou shalt haue the loue and grace of God. This manner of teaching is starke naught, and farre different and dissonant from the style and grauytye of the holy Doctors: and also vnworthy the honor of the diuine grace.
            For seeing that this whole busines is grace and the mercy of God; it is meete, that it be handled not as though it were of arte, but of grace: that by this manner man knowing what hee asketh, he may knowe, that

the cheefest meanes, by which he ought to dispose himselfe vnto this busines, is lowly humility, and the knowledge of his owne misery, with a most firme hope of the Diuine mercy: that by the knowledge of them both, teares may trickle downe, and prayers proceede: by which man being wayted vpon, hee may enter by the gate of humility, and receyue that hee desireth by humilitie, and gyue GOD thankes with humilitie: not hauing any trust, eyther in himselfe, or in his exercises, or in hys workes.
            Which although it bee true, yet this admonition and doctrine doth not exclude our labours, or that which we ought to doe. For although he that planteth, and he that watereth, is not the same that he is that giueth the increase

who is God: yet hee willeth neuerthelesse that wee should plant and water, that hee may giue the increase. No man doth doubt, that any thing doth so much require a guide and counsell, as a spirituall life: especially in the ioy and consolation of prayer; which as it is more delicate and diuine; so also it requireth more counsell and more instructions.
            And as it is vnmeete and vniust, that the exercise of prayer should bee taught as an Arte, least grace bee impayred and offended: so also man is to be admonished of all those thinges, that are necessary, least he stumble and fall in this way. For wee see some that after many yeeres dooe lyttle profit in this exercise, and others that passe theyr time ouer in recyting a

number of vocall prayers, who verye sildome dooe seriouslye thinke of, eyther that which belonges vnto God, or that which themselues speake. Therefore our Reader was to be admonished of both, that his labours may be more fruitefull.
         
         
            THE EIGHTEENTH admonition, of other kindes of prayers and meditations, which are wont to be vsed of them, who are more exercised. CHAP. LX.
            
            IT is also to bee noted in thys place, that those meditations, which we haue deuided into exercises

for euery day of the week, were written especially for yong 
                  •…
               eginners, that they might haue 
                  •…
               s it were a threed to lead them, 
                  •…
               east they wander in this labo
               
                  •…
               inth, and erre in this way as yet 
                  •…
               nknowen.
            But when they haue once made some proceeding and profit, it is not needfull, that they shoulde alwayes treade in the same path, but it is meet, that they go, whether the holy Ghost doth 
                  •…
               eade thē, who is wont to remoue his schollers from a lower forme to a higher. Therefore there are some, that leauing those considerations doe proceede to the meditations of diuine perfections, of the wonders of God, of his benefits, and in the meditation of them do dayly more and more profit, and encrease in his loue, who is infinitely good, the

giuer of all goodnes, and wonderfull in all his workes. There be others, that giue themselues to the meditation of the holy Scripture, which is the Ocean of infinite wonders and maruels, as many of the holy Doctors did, and many of the Fathers in the wildernes.
            There bee also others, that haue matter enough to meditate vppon, eyther as concerning those thinges that haue happened vnto themselues, or which they haue seene in others: whether they were the woorkes of grace, or of iudgement and Dyuine iustice.
            For if a man will open hys eyes, and will diligently looke into and examine his owne life from the beginning to the end from his conception and natyuity euen to this day, hee sha
                  •…
               
               
finde so manye and so greate thinges in himselfe to bee meditated vpon, as well benefits and fauours, which God hath bestowed vpon him, as daungers and perils, which GOD hath kept from him, that hee shall neuer want matter of meditation. But what shall I say of the admirable and wonderfull iudgementes of God, which happen dayly? of the vnexpected falles of many, who thought themselues safe and secure? of the punishmentes of the diuine Iustice? of the myracles of Gods prouidence? of the works of grace, which wee daily see to woorke wonders in his seruants?
            Let not a man sitte as a stone vppon a stone, but let him behoulde and obserue all those thynges, whych are done

vpon ye great stage & huge Theater of the house of God, which alwaies bringeth forth some nouel, which we may meditate vpon. There be others also more free to whome God hath shut the vaine of too much speculation, and hath opened the vayne of affection, that the will by a quyet and peaceable vnderstandinge may bee recreated and made merrye in GOD alone, bestowing it selfe wholye vpon the loue of the cheefest good.
            This is the moste perfecte estate of contemplation; to which we must alwayes aspire, in which a man doth not seeke as in the way, set on by the meditation of loue: but in which as in his country he doth now enioy his desired loue, being nowe found, and in this he resteth as in his end, saying

with the Spouse, I haue found 
               Cant. 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                
               him whom my soule loueth, I tooke hold on him, neither will I let him goe. In this state of meditation, both the labour is lesse, and the ioy and profit greater. And because the labour of meditation is lesser, the time of recollection, or of preparation may be a little longer, and yet without the tyring and wearines of the body. So Moses perseuering in his prayer, his hands being lift vp towards heauen, he obtained victory against Amalech.
            
         
         
            
            THE NINTEENTH and last admonition is, that this exercise is not conuenient for all kinde of men. CHAP. LXI.
            
            FVrthermore it is to be obserued, that although it be very profitable for young beginners, to exercise themselues in those meditations deliuered in our exercises; yet this is not altogether simply necessary; much lesse possible for all men. For there are many, who by reason of infirmitye, especially of the head, cannot without great danger, an
                  •…
                losse of their health, giue themselues

vnto this exercise, especially if they be yong beginners. Others are so bound vnto externall busines, that they cannot leaue it without offence, neither is any time permitted them, to prepare themselues for these exercises.
            There are others, that haue their soules so vnquiet, vndeuout, and dry, that whatsoeuer diligence they vse, it seemeth to profit them nothing. These ought not forthwith to breake off their prayers, but still continue, crying at his gate, who will not be wanting to them that with humilitie and perseuerance call vpon him. And albeit the gate be not as yet opened vnto them, yet let them not discourage nor cast downe themselues, but wait the Lords leysure, for all good giftes come from hym, and

he bestoweth them vpon whome he will, and when he will. It shall also profit these men, to reade some deuout and spirituall books with great attention and vnderstanding, and when they come to those places, that they haue some feeling by, and which doth concerne their estate, let them sticke long vpon them, and lift vp their harts vnto the Lord, that hee would showre downe vpon their dry soules the deaw of his grace. This is the best remedy, that can be giuen vnto dry and vndeuo
                  •…
                hearts; for by these meanes God oftentimes is wont to lift vp men to a deeper study of meditation.
            Againe there are others, wh
                  •…
                doe consume the whole time 
                  〈◊〉
                their life vpon the recountin
                  •…
                and thought of their sinnes an
                  •…

passion of Christ, or vpon any such like thing, whereby they might receiue ioy and comfort. These, as we sayd before, are not comforted by this, and their vnderstanding is conuersant in ignorance; which Saint Bernard doth also confesse: For besides 
                  •…
               hat in this exercise some temp

               hey were forsaken.
            They do contrary vnto these, who the first day that they begin, do altogether forget their sinnes, 
                  •…
               nd by the lightnes of their

                  •…
               oundation. Who afterwardes,

when they would returne to meditate on lower matters, they cannot, neyther do they know the way vnto them; because they haue accustomed themselues vnto higher and more delicate reaches; and so they want both the grounds: that is, they can neither walke nor flye. Therefore it is best for vs at the first to be busied with the remembrance of our sinnes, rather then with any other thing: afterwards by little and little let vs go forward, relinquishing this cogitation, and draw euery day more neere and neere vnto the sacred passion of our Sauiour, albeit we indeede should neuer be without the cogitation and thought of both of them.
            If there be any man to be found, that shal finde no iuyce of deuotion in these things that haue bin in this booke spoken of, and that

desireth to mediate on other matters: let him consider & melitate on those things, which per

            THE CONCLVSION of this Booke. CHAP. LXII.
            
            HEtherto wee haue handled (Christian Reader) those

foure things, which we promised in the beginning of the booke: to wit, we haue spoken of those things, which stirre vp and procure Deuotion: and of those things that hinder it: in like maner of the more vsuall and common temptations, which are wont to happen in this way: and of certayne admonitions and counsayles to be obserued in this exercise. I know that many other things may be spoken, but for further knowledge, I referre the reader to the Magistery of the holy Ghost, and to dayly experience, which he ought to take for a mistres, who will succesfully walke in this way.
