               Thy Trauels and thy Glory to ennamell,
               With Fame we mount thee on the lofty Cammell;
               But Cammels, Elephants, nor Horſe nor Aſſe
               Can beare thy Worth, that worthleſſe doſt ſurpaſſe.
               The World's the beaſt that muſt thy Palfrey be,
               Thou rid'ſt the World, and all the World rides thee.

               O Thou whoſe ſharp toes cuts the Globe in quarters,
               
                  Mongſt Iewes & Greeks & tyrannizing Tartars:
               Whoſe glory through the vaſtie Welkin rumbles,
               And whoſe great Acts more then nine Muſes mumbles,
               Whoſe ratling Fame Apollo's daughters thunders,
               Midſt Africke monſters, and 'mongst Aſian wonders.
               Accept theſe footed verſes I implore thee,
               That heere (Great Footman) goe on foote before thee:
               To ſing thy praiſe I would my Muſe inforce,
               But that (alas) ſhe is both harſh and hoarſe:
               And therefore pardon this my Loues Epiſtle,
               For though ſhe cannot ſing, Ile make her whiſtle.
            
         
         
            
            
            IN PRAISE OF THE Author Maiſter Thomas Coriat.
            
            
               THou that the world with pleaſures full haſt pleaſur'd,
               And out of meaſure many kingdomes meaſur'd.
               Whil'ſt men (like ſwine) doe in their vices wallow,
               And not one dares for's eares thy ſteps to follow:
               Not one within the Compaſſe of the Cope,
               Like thee that dar'ſt ſuruay the Horoſcope:
               
                  
For who is he that dares call it a lye,
               That thou haſt trotted into Italie;
               By th'edge of France, and skirts of Spaine th'haſt rambled,
               Through Belgia and through Germany th'aſt ambled.
               
                  And, Denmarke, Sweden, Norway, Auſtria,
               Pruce, Poland, Hungarie, Muſcouia,
               With Thracia, and the land of merry Greekes,
               
               All theſe and more applaud thee, that who ſeekes
               Vpon the top of Mount Olimpus front,
               Perhaps may ſee thy name inſculp'd vpon't,
               And he that durſt detract thy worthin Europe,
               
               I wiſh he may be hang'd vp in a new rope.
               It were a world of buſineſſe to repeat
               Thy walkes through both the Aſiaes, leſſe and great,
               Whereas (no doubt) but thou haſt tane ſuruay
               Of China and the kingdome of Catay.

               Thou haſt or'e look'd the Sea call'd Mortuus Lacus.
               And I durſt venter ſomewhat for a wager
               Thou haſt ſeene Ionia, Lidia, Miſia Maior,
               Old Iliums Ruins, and the wracks of Priam,

            A LITTLE REMEMBRANCE OF his variety of Tongues, and Politicke forme of TRAVELL.
            
               
                  A Very Babell of confuſed Tongues
               Vnto thy little Microcoſme belongs,
               That to what place ſoeuer thou dooſt walk,
               Thou wilt loſe nothing through the want of talke.
               For thou canſt kiſſe thy hand, and make a legge,
               And wiſely canſt in any language begge,
               
                  
And ſure to begge 'tis pollicie (I note)
               It ſometimes ſaues the cutting of thy throat:
               For the worſt thiefe that euer liu'd by ſtealth,
               Will neuer kill a beggar for his wealth.
               But who is't but thy wiſedome doth admire,
               That doth vnto ſuch high conceits aſpire.
               Thou tak'ſt the bounty of each bounteous giuer,
               And drink'ſt the liquor of the running riuer:
               Each Kitchin where thou com'ſt, thou haſt a Cooke,
               Thou neuer run'ſt on ſcore vnto the Brooke;
               For if thou didſt, the Brooke and thou would'ſt gree,
               Thou runſt from it, and it doth run from thee.
               In thy returne from Agra and Aſſmere
               
               By thy relation following doth appeare,
               That thou doſt purpoſe learnedly to fling
               A rare Oration to the Perſian King.
               
                  
Then let the idle world prate this, and that,
               The Perſian King will giue thee (God knowes what▪)
               And furthermore to me it wondrous ſtrange is,
               How thou doſt meane to ſee the Riuer Ganges,
               
               
                  With Tigris, Euphrates, and Nimrods Babell,
               And the vnhappy place where Caine ſlew Abell.
               
               That if thou were in Hebrew circumſiſed,
               The Rabbyes all were wondrous ill aduiſed:
               Nay more, they were all Coxecombes, all ſtarke mad
               To thinke thou wert of any Tribe but Gad.
               
               Sure, in thy youth thou eat'ſt much running fare,
               As Trotters, Neates-feete, and the ſwift-foot Hare,
               And ſo by inſpiration fed, it bred
               Two going feet to beare one running head.
               Thou fil'ſt the Printers Preſſe with Griefe and mourning,
               Still gaping, and expecting thy returning:
               
                  
All Pauls-Church yard is fil'd with melancholy,
               Not for the want of Bookes, or wit; but folly.
            
            
               
            
            
               It is for them, to grieue too much for thee,
               For thou wilt come when thou thy time ſhalt ſee.
               
                  
But yet at one thing much my Muſe doth muſe,
               Thou auſt ſo many commendations vſe
               Vnto thy Mother and to diuers friends,
               Thou haſt 
                     ••
                  membred many kinde commends,
               And till the laſt thou didſt forget thy Father,
               I know not why, but this conceit I gather,
               That as men ſitting at a feaſt to eat,
               Begin with Beefe, Porke, Mutton, and ſuch meate;
               And when their ſtomacks are a little cloyd,
               This firſt courſe then the voyder doth auoid:
               The anger of their hunger being paſt,
               The Pheaſant and the Partridge comes at laſt.
               This (I imagine) in thy mindedid fail,
               To note thy Father laſt to cloſe vp all.
               Firſt to thy Mother here thou doſt commend,
               And laſtly to thy Father thou doſt ſend:
               
                  
She may command in thee a Filiall awe,
               But he is but thy Father by the Law.
               To heare of thee, mirth euery heart doth cheere,
               But we ſhould laugh out-right to haue thee heere.
               For who is it that knowes thee, but would chooſe,
               Farther to haue thy preſence then thy newes.
               Thou ſheweſt how well thou ſetſt thy wits to worke,
               In tickling of a misbeleeuing Turke:
               
               He cal'd thee Giaur, but thou ſo well didſt anſwer
               (Being hot and fiery, like to crabbed Caneer)
               
               That if he had a Turke of ten pence bin,
               Thou told'ſt him plaine the errors he was in;
               His Alkaron, his Moskyes are whim-whams,
               Falſe bug-beare bables, fables all that dams,
               Sleights of the Deuill, that brings perpetuall woe,
               Thou waſt not mealy mouth'd to tell him ſo.
               
                  
And when thy talke with him thou didſt giue ore,
               As wiſe he parted as he was before:
               His ignorance had not the power to ſee
               Which way or how to edifie by thee:
               But with the Turke (thus much I build vpon)
               If words could haue done good, it had beene done.

               ❧ Maſter Thomas Coriats Commendations to his friends in England. FromAgra the Capitall City of the Dominion of the Great MOGOLL in the Eaſterne India, the laſt of October, 1616.
            
               Moſt deare and welbeloued Mother,
            
            
               THough I haue ſuperſcribed my letter from Azmere, the Court of the greateſt Monarch of the Eaſt called the Great Magoll in the Eaſtern India, which I did to this end, that thoſe that haue the charge of conueiance thereof, perceiuing ſuch a title, may be the more carefull and diligent to conuey it ſafely to your hands: yet in truth the place

from which I wrote this letter is Agra, a City in the ſaid Eaſtern India, which is the Metropolitan of the whole Dominion of the foreſaid King Mogol, & 10 daies iourny frō his Court at the ſaid Azmere. Frō the ſame Azmere I departed the 12 day of September, An. 1616, after my abode there 12 moneths & 60 daies; which though I confeſſe it were a too long time to remaine in one and the ſelfeſame place, yet for two principall cauſes it was very requiſite for me to remaine there ſome reaſonable time: firſt to learne the languages of thoſe Countries, through which I am to paſſe betwixt the bounds of the Teritories of this Prince and Chriſtendome, namely theſe three, the Perſian, Turkiſh, and Arab: which I haue in ſome competent meaſure attained vnto by my labour and induſtry at the ſaid Kings Court, matters as auaileable vnto me as mony in my purſe, as being the cheifeſt or rather onely meane to get me mony if I ſhould happen to be deſtitute, a matter very incidentall to a poore Footman Pilgrim, as my ſelfe in theſe heathen and Mahometan Countries through which I trauell: Secondly, that by the helpe of one of thoſe languages, I meane the Perſian, I might both procure vnto my ſelfe acceſſe vnto the King, & be able to expreſſe my mind vnto him about the matter for the which I ſhould haue occaſiō to diſcours with him. Theſe were the reaſōs that moued me ſo long to tarry at the Mogols court, during which time I abode in the houſe of the Engliſh Merchants my deare Countrimen, not

ſpending one little peece of mony either for diet, waſhing, lodging▪ or any other thing. And as for the Perſian tongue, which I ſtudied very earneſtly, I attained to that reaſonable skill, and that in a fewe moneths, that I made an Oration vnto the King before many of his Nobles in that language, and after I had ended the ſame, diſcourſed with his Maieſty alſo in that tongue very readily & familiarly; the coppy of which ſpeech, though the tong it ſelfe wil ſeem to an Engliſhman very ſtrange & vncuth, as hauing no kind of affinity with any of our Chriſtian languages, I haue for nouelty ſake written out in this letter, together with the tranſlation thereof in Engliſh, that you may ſhew it to ſome of my lerned friends of the Clergy, and alſo of the temporalty in Euil, and elſwere, who belike, wil take ſome pleaſure in reading ſo rare and vnuſuall a tongue as this is. The Perſian is this that followeth.

                           LOrd This is the ordinary title that is giuen him by all ſtrangersProtector of the world all haile to you▪ I am a poore Traueller and world ſeer, which am come hither from a farre country, namely England, which auncient Hiſtorians thought to haue been ſcituated in the fartheſt bounds of the Weſt, and which is the Queene of all the Ilands in the world. The cauſe of my comming hither is for foure reſpects. Firſt to ſee the bleſſed face of your Maieſty, whoſe wonderfull fame hath reſounded ouer all Europe & the Mahometan Countries. Whē I heard of the fame of your Maieſty, I haſtened hither with ſpeed and trauelled very cherefully to ſee your glorious Court. Secondly, to ſee your Maieſties Elephants, which kind of beaſts I haue not ſeen in any other country. Thirdly, to ſee your famous Riuer Ganges, which is the Captaine of all the Rieuer of the world. The fourth is this, to intreat your Maieſty that you would vouchſafe to grant mee your gracious Paſſe that I may trauell into the Country of Tartaria to the Citty of Samarcand, to viſit the bleſſed Sepulcher of the Lord of the Corners (this is a title that is giuen to Tamberlaine in this Country in that Perſian language, and wheras they call him the Lord of the Corners, by that they meane that he was Lord of the corners of the world, that is, the higheſt and ſupreme Monarch of the Vniuerſe): whoſe fame by reaſon of his warres and victories,

is publiſhed ouer the whole world: perhaps he is not altogether ſo famous in his own Country of Tartaria, as in England. Moreouer, I haue a great deſire to ſee the bleſſed Toombe of the Lord of the Corners for this cauſe; for that when I was at Conſtantinople, I ſaw a notable old building in a pleaſant garden neer the ſaid City, where the Chriſtian Emperor that was called Emanuell made a ſumptuous great Banquet to the Lord of the Corners, after he had taken Sultan Batazet in a great battell that was fought neere the City of Burſia, where the Lord of the Corners bound Sultan Batazet in fetters of Gold, and put him in a cage of Iron. Theſe 4 cauſes moued me to come out of my natiue Country thus farre, hauing trauelled a foote through Turky and Perſia, ſo farre haue I traced the world into this Country, that my pilgrimage hath accompliſhed three thouſand miles, wherin I haue ſuſtained much labour and toile, the like wherof no mortall man in this World did euer performe to ſee the bleſſed face of your Maieſty ſince the firſt day that you were inaugurated in your glorious Monarchall throne.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            After I had ended my ſpeech, I had ſome ſhort diſcourſe with him in the Perſian tongue who amongſt other things told me, that concerning my trauell to the City of Samarcand, he was not able to doe me any good, becauſe there was no great amity betwixt the Tartarian Princes and himſelfe, ſo that his commendatory letters would doe me no

good. Alſo he added, that the Tartars did ſo deadly hate all Chriſtians, that they would certainely kill them when they came into their Country. So that he earneſtly diſwaded me frō the iourny, if I loued my life and welfare; at laſt he concluded his diſcourſe with me by a ſum of mony that he threw downe from a windowe through which he looked out, into a ſheete tied vp by the foure corners, and hanging very neer the ground a hundred peeces of ſiluer, each worth two ſhillings ſterling, which coū
               teruailed ten pounds of our Engliſh mony: this buſines I carried ſo ſecretly by the help of my Perſian, that neither our Engliſh Ambaſſador, nor any other of my Countrimen (ſauing one ſpeciall, priuate, & intrinſical friend) had the leaſt inkling of it, till I had throughly accompliſhed my deſigne: for I well knew that our Ambaſſador▪ would haue ſtopped and Barracadocd all my proceeding therein, if he might haue had any notice thereof, as indeed he ſignified vnto me after I had effected my proiect, aleaging this forſooth for his reaſon why he would haue hindered me, becauſe it would redound ſome what to the diſhonour of our Nation, that one of our Countrey ſhould preſent himſelfe in that beggarly and poore faſhion to the King out of an inſinuating humor to craue mony of him, but I anſwered our Ambaſſador in that ſtout & reſolute manner after I had ended my buſines, that he was contented to ceaſe nibling at me, neuer had I more need of mony in all my life then at that time: for in truth

I had but twenty ſhillings ſterling left in my purſe by reaſon of a miſchance I had in one of the Turkes Cities called Emert in the country of Meſopotamia, where a miſcreant Turke ſtripped me of almoſt all my monies, according as I wrote vnto you in a very large letter the laſt yeer, which I ſent from the Court of this mighty Monarch by one of my Countrimen that went home by Sea in an Engliſh ſhippe laden with the commodities of this India, which letter I hope came to your hands long ſince. After I had been with the King, I went to a certaine noble & generous Chriſtian of the Armeniā race, 2 daies iourny frō the Mogols court, to the end to obſerue certain remarkable matters in the ſame place, to whom by means of my Perſian tongue I was ſo welcome that hee entertained me with very ciuill and courteous complement, and at my departure gaue mee very bountifully twenty peeces of ſuch kind of mony as the King had done before, coūteruailing 40 ſhillings ſterling. About ten daies after that, I departed frō 
               Azmere the court of the Mogol Prince, to the end to begin my Pilgrimage after my long reſt of fourteen moneths back againe into Perſia, at what time our Ambaſſador gaue mee a peece of Gold of this Kings Coine worth foure and twenty ſhillings, which I will ſaue (if it be poſſible) till my ariuall in England: ſo that I haue receiued for beneuolences ſince I came into this country twenty markes ſterling ſauing two ſhillings eight pence, & by the way vppon the confines of Perſia alitle before

I came into this country three and thirty ſhillings foure pence in Perſian mony of my Lady Sherly: at this preſent I haue in the City of Agra where hence I wrote this letter, about twelue pounds ſterling, which according to my maner of liuing vppon the way at two-pence ſterling a day (for with that proportion I can liue pretty well, ſuch is the cheapnes of all eatable things in Aſia, drinkable things coſting nothing, for ſeldome doe I drinke in my pilgrimage any other liquor then pure water) will mainetaine mee very competently three yeeres in my trauell with meate drinke and clothes. Of theſe gratuities which haue been giuen me willingly, would I ſend you ſome part as a demonſtration of the filiall loue and affection which euery child bred in ciuility and humility ought to performe to his louing and good mother: but the diſtance of ſpace betwixt this place and England, the hazard of mens liues in ſo long a ioureny, and alſo the infidelity of many men, who though they liue to come home, are vnwilling to render an account of the things they haue receiued, doe not a little diſcourage me to ſend any precious token vnto you; but if I liue to come one day to Conſtantinople againe (for thither doe I reſolue to goe once more by the grace of Chriſt, and therehence to take my paſſage by land into Chriſtendom ouer renouned Greece) I wil make choice of ſome ſubſtantial & faithfull Countriman, by whom I will ſend ſome prety token as an expreſſion of my dutifull and obedient

reſpect vnto you. I haue not had the oppertunity to ſee the King of Perſia as yet ſince I came into this country, but I haue reſolued to goe to him when I come next into his Territories, and to ſearch him out whereſoeuer I can find him in his Kingdome; for ſeeing I can diſcourſe with him in his Perſian tongue, I doubt not but that going vnto him in the forme of a Pilgrime, he will not onely entertaine me with good words, but alſo beſtow ſome worthy reward vpon me beſeeming his dignity and perſon; for which cauſe I am prouided before hand with an excellent thing written in the Perſian tongue that I meane to preſent vnto him: and thus I hope to get beneuolences of worthy perſons to maintaine me in a competent maner in my whole pilgrimage till I come into England, which I hold to be as laudable & a more ſecure courſe then if I did continually carry ſtore of mony about mee. In the letter which I wrote vnto you by an Engliſh ſhip the laſt yeere, I made relation vnto you both of my iourny from the once holy Hieruſalem hither and of the ſtate of this Kings Court, and the Cuſtomes of this Country, therfore I hold it ſuperfluous to repeat the ſame things againe, but what the countryes are, that I meane to ſee betwixt this and Chriſtendome, and how long time I will ſpend in each country, I am vnwilling to aduertiſe you of at this preſent, deſiring rather to ſignify that vnto you after I haue performed my deſigne then before; howbeit in few words, I will tell you of certaine Cities

of great renown in former times, but now partly ruined, that I reſolue (by Gods help) to ſee in Aſia, where I now am, namely ancient Babilon & Nymrods Tower, ſome few miles from Niniue, & in the ſame the Sepulcher of the Prophet Ionas, ſpacious & goodly; Caire in Egypt, heretofore Memphis, vpō the famous Riuer Nilus, where Moiſes, Aron, & the children of Iſrael liued with king Pharaoh, whoſe ruined Palace is ſhewed there til this day, & a world of other mouable things as memorable as any City of the whole world yeeldeth, ſauing only Ieruſalem: but in none of theſe or any other Cities of note do I determin to linger as I haue done in other places, as in Conſtantinople, and Azmere, in this Eaſterne India, onely ſome few daies will I tarry in a principall city of fame, to obſerue euery principal matter there and ſo be gone. In this City of Agra where I am now, I am to remaine about ſix weekes longer, to the end to expect an excellent oportunity, which then will offer it ſelfe vnto me to goe to the famous Riuer Ganges, about fiue daies iourny from this, to ſee a memorable meeting of the gentle people of this country called Baieans, whereof about foure hundred thouſand people go thither of purpoſe to bathe and ſhaue themſelues in the Riuer, and to ſacrifice a world of gold to the ſame Riuer, partly in ſtamped mony, & partly in maſſy great lumpes and wedges, throwing it into the Riuer as a ſacrifice, and doing other ſtrange Ceremonies moſt worthy the obſeruation, ſuch a notable ſpectacle it is, that

no part of all Aſia, neither this which is called the great Aſia, nor the leſſer, which is now called Natolia, the like is to be ſeen; this ſhew doe they make once euery yeere, comming thither from places almoſt a thouſand miles off, and honour their Riuer as their God, Creator, and Sauiour; ſuperſtition and impiety moſt abominable in the higheſt degree of theſe brutiſh Ethnicks, that are aliens from Chriſt & the common-wealth of Iſrael. After I haue ſeen this ſhew, I wil with all expedition repaire to the city of Lahore, twenty daies iourny from this and ſo into Perſia by the helpe of my bleſſed Chriſt.
            Thus haue I imported vnto you ſome good accidents that happened vnto me ſince I wrote a letter vnto you the laſt yeere from the Kings Court, & ſome litle part of my reſolution for the diſpoſing of a part of my time of abode in Aſia: Therefore now I will draw to a concluſion; the time I cannot limit when I ſhall come home, but as my mercifull God and Sauiour ſhall diſpoſe of it. A long rabble of commēdations like to that which I wrote in my laſt letter to you I hold not ſo requiſite to make at this preſent: Therefore with remembrance of ſome fewe friends names, I will ſhut vp my preſent Epiſtle. I pray you recommend me firſt in Odcombe to Maſter Gollop, and euery good body of his family, if he liueth yet, to Maſter Berib, his wife and all his Family, to all the Knights, William Chunt, Iohn Selly, Hugh Donne, and their wiues, to Maſter Atkins & his wife at Norton, I pray commend me in

               Euill to theſe, to old Mr 
               Seward if he liueth, his wife and children; the poore Widow Darby, old Maſter Dyer, and his Sonne Iohn, Maſter Ewins old and young with their wiues, Maſter Phelpes and his wife, Maſter Starre and his wife, with the reſt of my good friends there, (I had almoſt forgotten your husband) to him alſo, to Ned Barber and his wife, to William Ienings: commend me alſo I pray you, & that with reſpectfull and dutifull termes to the godly and reuerent fraternitie of Preachers that euery ſecond Friday meet at a religious exerciſe at Euill, at the leaſt if that exerciſe doth continue, pray read this letter to them, for I thinke they wilbe well pleaſed with it by reaſon of the nouelties of things. And ſo finally I commit you and all them to the bleſſed protection of Almighty God.

               The Copy of a ſpeech that J made to a Mahometan in the Italian tongue.
            THe Coppy of a ſpeech that I made extempore in the Italian tongue to a Mahometan at a Citie called Moltan in the Eaſterne India, two daies iourny beyond the famous Riuer Indus, which I haue paſſed, againſt Mahomet and his accurſed Religion, vpon the occaſiō of a diſcurteſie offered vnto mee by the ſaid Mahometan in calling me Gtaur, that is infidell, by reaſon that I was a Chriſtian: the reaſon why I ſpake to him in Italian, was becauſe he vnderſtood it, hauing been taken ſlaue for many yeeres ſince by certaine Florentines in a Gally wherein hee paſſed from Conſtantinople towards Alexandra, but being by them interrupted by the way, he was carried to a Citie called Ligorne in the Duke of Florences Dominions, where after two yeeres he had learned good Italian, but he was an Indian borne and brought vp in the Mahometan Religion. I pronounced the ſpeech before an hundred people, whereof none vnderſtood it but himſelfe, but hee afterward told the meaning of ſome part of it as far as he could remember it to ſome of the others alſo. If I had ſpoken thus much in Turky, or Perſia againſt Mahomet they would haue roſted me vpon a ſpitt; but in the Mogols Dominions a Chriſtian may ſpeake much more freely then hee can in any other Mahometan Country in the world. The ſpeech was this as I afterward tranſlated it into Engliſh.
            
               
                  
But I pray thee tell me thou Mahometan, doſt thou in ſadnes call me Giaur? that I doe quoth he, then (quoth I) in very ſoberſadnes I retort that ſhamefull word in thy throate, and tell thee plainly that I am a Muſulman and thou art a Giaur: For by that Arab word Muſulman thou doſt vnderſtand that which cannot be properly applied to a Mahometan but onely to a Chriſtian, ſo that I doe conſequently inferre that there are two kindes of Muſelmen, the one an Orthomuſulmā, that is a true Muſulman which is a Chriſtian & the other a Pſeudo-muſulman that is a falſe Muſulman which is a Mahometan. What, thy Mahomet was from whom thou doſt deriue thy Religion, aſſure thy ſelfe I know better then any one of the Mahometans amongſt many millions: yea all the particular circumſtances of his life and death, his Nation, his Parentage, his driuing Camels through Egipt, iria, and Paleſtina, the marriage of his Miſtris, by whoſe death he raiſed himſelfe from a very baſe and contemtible eſtate to great honor and

riches, his manner of cozening the ſottiſh people of Arabia, partly by a tame Pigeon that did fly to his eare for meat, and partly by a tame Bull that hee fed by hand euery pay, with the reſt of his actions both in peace and warre: I know aſwell as if I had liued in his time, or had beene one of his neighbours in Mecca, the truth whereof if thou didſt know aſwell, I am perſwaded thou wouldeſt ſpit in the face of thy Alcaron, and trample it vnder thy feete, and bury it vnder a Iaxe, a booke of that ſtrange and weake matter, that I my ſelfe (as meanely as thou doſt ſee me attired now) haue already written two better bookes (God be thanked) and will hereafter this, (by Gods gratious permisſion) write another better and truer, yea I wold haue thee know (thou Mahometan) that in that renouned Kingdome of England where I was borne, learning doth ſo flouriſh, that there are many thouſand boies of ſixteene yeeres of age▪ that are able to make a more learned booke then thy Alcaron, neither was it (as thou and the

reſt of you Mahometans doe generally beleue) compoſed wholy by Mahomet, for hee was of ſo dull a wit, as he was not able to make it without the helpe of another, namely a certaine Renegado Monke of Conſtantinople, called Sergis. So that his Alcoran was like an arrow drawne out of the quiuer of another man. I perceiue thou doſt wonder to ſee me ſo much inflamed with anger, but I would haue thee conſider it is not without great cauſe I am ſo moued, for what greter indignity can there be offered to a Chriſtian which is an Arthomuſulman, thē to be called Giaur by a Giaur: for Chriſt (whoſe Religion I profeſſe) is of that incomparable dignity, that as thy Mahomet is not worthy to bee named that yeere wherein my bleſſed Chriſt is, ſo neither is his Alcoron worthy to be named that yeere wherein the This doe all Mahometans call our Goſpell or the History of our Saniour, written by the foure Evangeliſts.
                  Iuieel of my Chriſt is. I haue obſerued among the Mahometans ſuch a fooliſh forme of praier euer ſince my departure from Spahan, (which I confeſſe was no nouelty vnto me, for that I had obſerued the like before both

in Conſtantinople and diuers other Turkiſh cities) that what with your vain repetions & diuers other prophane fooleries contained therein▪ I am certaine your praiers doe euen ſtinke before God, and are of no more force then the cry of thy Camell when thou doeſt lade or vnlade him: But the praiers of Chriſtians haue ſo preuailed with God, that in time of drought they haue obtained conuenient aboundance of raine, and in time of peſtilence a ſuddaine ceſſation from the plague, ſuch an effect of holy and feruent praier as neuer did the Words that the Mahometans doe often repeat in their praiers.
                  Scofferalahs, or the Allamiſſel alow of any Mahometan produce: yet muſt wee, whoſe praiers like a ſweete ſmelling ſacrifice are acceptable to God, be eſteemed Giaurs by thoſe whoſe praiers are odious vnto his Diuine Maieſtie: O times! O maners! Now as I haue told thee the difference betwixt the effect of our Chriſtian & your Mahometan praiers, ſo I pray thee obſerue another difference betwixt you & vs, that I will preſently intimate vnto thee: thou by the obſeruation of the Law of thy

rediculous Alcaron doſt hope for Paradice, wherein thy Maſter Mahomet hath promiſed Riuers of Rice, and to Virgins the imbracing of Angels vnder the ſhaddowe of ſpacious Trees, though in truth that Paradice be nothing elſe then a filthy quagmire ſo full of ſtincking dung-hils that a man cannot walke two ſpaces there but he ſhall ſtumble at a dung-hill and defile himſelfe, but where this Paradice is, not one amongſt a thouſand of you knoweth, therefore I will tell thee, it ſtandeth in a Country ſcituate betwixt Heauen and Earth called 
                     Ʋtopia, whereof there is mention in the third book of thy Alcaron and in the ſeuen and thirty Aſaria, but expreſſed with thoſe miſticall and obſcure termes that is very difficult to vnderſtand it, for this Vtopian Paradice I ſay as the reward of al your ſuperſtitious mumbling in your praiers, and the often ducking downe of your heads when you kiſſe the ground, with ſuch a deuoute humilitie forſooth, doe you Mahometans hope in another world: But wee Chriſtians hope to liue

with God and his bleſſed Angels for euer and euer in Heauen, as being a proper and pecullar inheritance purchaſed vnto vs by the precious blood of our Chriſt, yet muſt wee be reputed Giaurs by thoſe that are Giaurs? One thing more will tell thee (O thou Mahometan) and ſo I will conclude this tedious ſpeech, whereunto thy diſcurtious calling of me Giaur hath inforced mee, and I prethee obſerue this my concluſion.
               Learning (which is the moſt precious Iewell that man hath in this life, by which he attaineth to the knowledge of diuine and humane things) commeth to man either by reuelatiō which we otherwiſe cal inſpiration, or by induſtry: Learning by reuelation I cal that which God doth infuſe from aboue by his ſpecial grace, vnto thoſe whō he will vſe as the inſtruments of his glory, who without labour or trauell doe aſpire to a moſt eminent degree of knowledge. Learning by induſtry I call it that which a man doth purchaſe to himſelfe by continuall writing and reading, by practiſe and meditation: now by

neither of theſe meanes haue the Mahometans acquired any meane, much leſſe any ſingular learning, for as Mahomet himſelfe was a man of a very ſuperficiall and meane learning, ſo neuer was there any one of his Diſciples in any part of the world that was indued with any profound knowledge▪ but wee Chriſtians by the one and the other meane, haue attained to the moſt exquiſite ſcience that can be incident to man: I mean the bleſſed Apoſtles of our Sauiour.ſome of our men that neuer were brought vp in Studies hauing been ſo expert in a generall learning (onely by Gods ſpeciall illumination) as thoſe haue ſpent forty yeeres in the practiſe thereof, and others by continuall practiſe of writing and reading, haue beene ſo excellent, that they became the very Lampes and Stars of the Countries wherein they liued. Theſe things being ſo, it cannot poſſible come to paſſe that the omnipotent God ſhould deale ſo partially with mankind as to reueale his will to a people altogether miſled in ignorance and blindnes as you Mahometans are, and conceale

it from vs Chriſtians that beſtowe all our life time in the practiſe of diuine and humane diſciplines, and in the ardent inuocation of Gods holy name with all ſincerity and purity of heart? Goe to then thou Pſeu-domuſulman, that is, thou falſe-beleeuer, ſince by thy iniurious imputation laid vpon mee, in that thou calledſt mee Giaur, thou haſt prouoked mee to ſpeake thus. I pray thee let this mine anſwere be a warning for thee not to ſcandalize mee in the like manner any more, for the Chriſtian Religion which I profeſſe, is ſo deare and tender vnto mee that neither thou nor any other Mahometan ſhal ſcotfree call me Giaur, but that I will quit you with an anſwer muchto the wonder of thoſe Mahometans▪
               
            
            
               
I pray you Mother expect no more letters from me after this till my arriuall in Chriſtendom, becauſe I haue reſolued to write no more while I am in the Mahometans Countries, thinking that it will be a farre greater comfort both to you and to all my friends whatſoeuer, to heare newes that I haue accompliſhed my trauelles in Mahometiſme, then that I am comming vp and down, to and fro in the ſame, without any certainty of an iſſue therof; therfore I pray haue patiēce for a time: about two yeers and a halfe hence I hope to finiſh theſe Mahometan trauelles, and then either from the Citie of Raguzi in Sclauonia which is a Chriſtian Citie and the firſt we enter into Chriſtendome, from thoſe parts of Turky by Land nere vnto the ſame or, from famous Venice, I will very dutifully remember you againe with lines full of filiall piety and officious reſpect. I haue written two letters to my Vncle Williams ſince I came forth of England and no more, whereof one from the Mogols Court the laſt yeere, iuſt at the ſame time that I wrote vnto you; and another now, which I ſent 
                  •
               ointly by the ſame Meſſenger that carried yours out of India by Sea. Once more I recommend you and all our hearty wel-willers & friends to the gratious tuition of the Lord of Hoſts; I pray you remember my duty to Maſter Hancoke that reuerend and Apoſtolicall good old man, and his wife, if they are yet liuing; to their Sonnes Thomas and Iohn, and their Wiues.

               And 'tis a doubt to me, whoſe paines is more,
               Thou that didſt write, or they that read them o're:
               My Scullers muſe without or Art or skill,
               In humble ſeruice (with a Gooſes quill)
               Hath tane this needles, fruitles paines for thee,
               Not knowing when thoul't doe as much for me.
               But this is not the firſt, nor ſhall not be
               The laſt (I hope) that I ſhall write for thee.
               
                  
For when newes thou waſt drown'd did hither come,
               I wrote a mournefull Epicedium.
               
               And after when I heard it was a lye,
               I wrote of thy ſuruiuing preſently.
               Laugh and be fat, the Scullers booke, and this
               Shewes how my minde to thee addicted is;

               And much I long to ſee thee heere againe,
