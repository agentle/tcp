                  Whereunto are annexed certaine other sermons, preached by the sayde reuerende Father, in Lincolneshire, which were gathered, and collected by Augustine Bernher, a seruaunt of his, though not so perfectly as they were vttered: yet faythfully & truly, to the singuler commoditie & profyt of the christē reader, faythfully perused & alowed according to thorder appointed in the Queens Maiesties Iniunctions.

                  THat princely prophet Dauid describing the peruerse nature and wicked properties of the vngodlie and reprobates, amongst other crimes wherof he 
                        〈◊〉
                      accuse them, he laith also to theyr charge that they haue not called vpon God. By the whiche wordes he doth manifestly teache, that they whiche doo not geue themselues to 
                        〈◊〉
                      and saythfull prayer and 
                        〈◊〉
                      ge of the name of God, are in the number of those whiche doo saye in theyr hartes there is no God. For as the Godly by theyr earnest and continuall praying and praysing of the name of God, doo declare their reuerend feare they beare towardes his diuine maiestye, and theyr vnfayned loue the whiche is grafted in their harts by the gratious and diuine spirit, towardes their heauenly and most louing father, by the whiche they ar incoraged willingly and chearfully to walke in the waye of Godlynes, and to frame their lyues to the will and pleasure of him whom they feare and loue: So on the contrarye syde, the vngodly, in that they doo not call vppon their God, neither prayse him, most euidently declare that they stand not in awe of him, nor loue him, but rather despise him as one that is neither able to hurte or pleasure them.
                  By thys now that I haue sayed it doth manifestly appeare, that as saythfull and trew prayer is the occasion of all goodnes and godlynes, so thomitting & neglecting of the same, is the rote & cause of all sinne & mischief: And that wilbe more euident vnto them that doo consider with thē selues these two principall partes wherin trew prayer doth consist. The fyrst part of true praier is called in yt hebrew tōg, Thephilah the which sig 
                        〈◊〉
                      Iudicij vel cōdēnationis deprecatīonē, a harty & ernest request & suplica tiō made vnto god theternal iudge, for the remission, & pardon of synnes, the which request procedeth frō the harte yt is anguished by the ougsome sight of his wickednes, reueled by the brightnes of the law of God. The other part of prayer is called in yt same tōg, Thehillah. Laus, a prayse of gods mercies, the which doth folow the former request. For whē the hart so an guished hath poured out his grief, & is by the spirit of God certifyed that hys synnes be forgeuen, his prayer hearde for Christes sake: by and by it bursteth out into a ioyful praysing of the name of the Lord, who so graciously hath shewed hymselfe in geuing comfort vnto hys sorowfull conscience. In these two partes of prayer, the Children of God doo exercise them selues, that is, in lamenting of their synnes, and in reioysing in the forgeuenesse of the same, the whiche consisteth in the deathe of Christe.
                  Wheruppon the third parte foloweth, the which is to craue at their fathers hands suche thynges as be nedefull for them in this worlde. Nowe he that beholdeth diligently the state of the worlde, shall

                      plaged vs, and toke the same away agayne, and caused by the deuils hangmen (the papists I meane) darknes, blind nes, and most pestiferous doctrine to be brought into the churche, by reason wherof, a greate number that had before no lust to the truth (euen by Gods iust iudgement) were thē deceaued by lyes and so peryshed eternallye. And yet notwithstanding, the faythful Lord, in al these tormoylings preserued hys seruauntes, geuing vnto a number of them suche a princely spirit, that they were able to deride & laugh to scorne the threatnings of the tyrauntes, to despyse the terriblenes of prisons and torments, and in the ende, moste ioyfullye to ouercome and conquer deathe to the praise of God and theyr owne endles comforte. Unto other some, the

                      spirite, that they were able by hys grace to forsake the pleasures and commodityes of this worlde, and being armed with patience, wer content to trauell into far and vnknowē countreyes with theyr familyes and housholdes, hauing small worldlye prouision, or none at all, but trustyng to hys prouidence, who neuer forsaketh them that truste in hym. Besydes this, 'the same God preserued a greate number, euen in the middest of their enemyes, not onlye from bodely daungers, but also from being infected with that poysoned andThe congregation of the faith full at London in Quene Ma ryes tyme. blasphemous doctrine, that then in allopē 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , with shameles brags and ostentation was set abrode. I will not speake now of that wonderfull work of God, who caused his word to be preached, and his sacramēts ministred euen in the midste of the enemyes, in spyte of the deuill and all hys ministers.
                  These thinges the Lorde wroughte most gratiously for hys people. But whē the time came that the measure of wickednes of the wicked was full, the selfe same God, euen of his owne mercy, and by his owne power confounded his enemyes, by the meanes of our most gratious La dy the Queenes maiestie (for whose prosperous estate and preseruation the God of mercye graunte vnto all faythfull Christians grace, most instantly to praye) her most ioyfull comming to the imperiall croune of this Realm, who caused that filthy & dark antichristiā doctryne to vanish out of syght, and in steade therof that most glorious lyghte of the Gospell to shyne agayne, the whych sorowfully was wished for of all faythful Eng lish harts: restoring withall the preachers of the same Gospel, the which before wer expulsed as 
                        〈◊〉
                     , by the tyranny of the popish prelates.
                  The whiche benefites, as they be vnmeasurable, so ought they continually with thanckful hartes of all them that beare the name of christians to be considered. But as I sayd before, the most part of men doo not pas for these thynges. The light of the Gospell is not confortable vnto them, because they feele not the darknes that is in them: they be not troubled

with their owne wickednes: sinne lyeth lurking and slepyng within thē, and they haue fully, as it were, soide themselues to worldlye busynes, to clyme vp to get honors and dignities, and the pelfe of worldly 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and these thynges are the cause why they doo not 
                        〈◊〉
                      vnto the Lorde their God. But wo be vnto suche slepers in their owne sinnes, and forgetters of Gods benefites. A day will come when they shall wish them selus neuer to haue ben borne. Thus you see that the neglecting of pray er is the occasyon of that horrible vnthankfulnes & forgetfulnes of gods benefytes. What is to be sayde vnto them that contrarye to theyr owne hartes and consciences lye in sinne and wickednes, and wyll not amende theyr lyues, although they heare their synnes accused, condemned, and Gods vengeaunce pronounced vppon them: They bee so drouned with the desyres of theyr owne hartes, that they doo not pas for the wayes of the Lorde. Of suche kinde of men the world is full, whyche haue shameles forheades, beyng not abashed of theyr vylenes.
                  The cause of their miseries (as Dauid declareth) Is quia deum non in 
                        〈◊〉
                     , because they haue not called vppon God. But what kynde of prayer doo those men say (trow you) whiche call themselues spirituall and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the lot of the Lorde? It is as manifest as the none daye, that the most parte of them, neyther pray nor know what trewe prayer is. For if they did vse to pray as the trew christians doo, they coulde not chose but be compelled to amende theyr lynes: theyr consciences would be abashed to come before the Lorde without a harty purpose to amende theyr conuersation. Doth not the saying of Ose the Prophet take holde vpon theOse. vt. most parte of you that be of the popish clergie, and haue ben mossemongers: Where as he saythe, as theues wayte for a man, so the companye of prcests murther in the way by consent, for they worke mischief.
                  Did not you conspire together at the entry of

                      Marye to murther the people of God, in casting from you most trayterously the precyous Gospell of Jesus Christe? in submittyng your selues to that fylthye beast of Rome, and in receauyng the stinckyng I dolatrous masse, by the whiche you haue destreyed an inaumerable sorte of people? Are you sorye for these your doinges: Doo you humble your selues before the maiestye of the terrible God, with harty and faythful praier acknowledging your wickednes, and intending to eschew the same? No suche thynges can be perceaued in you. For where as before, in the tyme of antichryst, boldly and openlye, you did deceaue the people of theyr saluation in Chryste, now in the lyght of the gospel, secretly you whisper in to the eares of the simple and visswade them from receyuing of the truth: so that most iustlyNume

                      you may be compared vnto those spyes of whom we reade Nume. xiii. the whyche with theyr false reportes, did hynder the people of I sraell from entryng into the lande of promyse. For they beyng sente by Moyses to searche the land, and to bryng good tydings vnto the people, by the which they myght haue ben incouraged manfully to haue assayed their enemyes, and take possession of the land, they contraye to Moyses expectation, lyke faytheles men, came and discomforted the people, & caused them to mistrust Gods promises. And doo not ye the lyke? where as god hathe appoynted you to searche the lande of promise in hys holy worde, and to bryng tidinges of the same vnto his people, by faythfull and dilygent teachers, and incourage them to embrace and to lay holde vpon the

kyngdome of Christ, you lyke false messengers, eyther by your false reportes and wicked doctryne, doo hinder the people from entring into the promised land, or els lyke domme dogges that are not able to barke, you lye in your kennels, fedpng your bellyes, and making good cheare with the laboures and sweate of the poore people, not passyng wheather they swymme or synke, or what become of them.
                  Worthely therfore the Prophet Dauid numbreth you amongst them that say in theyr hartes there is no God: And this appeareth vnto all others, because ye doo not call vppon God. For if you did accastom to cal youre selues to an accompte before the maiestie of God, in your faythfull prayers, the remembraunce of your horrible murther of Gods people, of your idlenes, carelesnes, bellychere, ignoraunce of Gods will and word, secret

                      know that they themselues cannot pray vnto the Lorde theyr God, except theyr hartes be faythfully disposed to do the works of theyr vocatyon trewly and faithfully, of the which the

                      is to see the people instructed by faythfull ministers in the way

                      of all good gyfts, and knowe not the principles of theyr religion.
                  This matter is so 
                        〈◊〉
                      and of suche importaunce, that the magistratee, hauing the feare of god before their eyes, must nedes consider it with spede, for it toucheth the eternall saue garde of them, for whom the sonne of god did shede his owne hartes bloud: they oughte to be put into

hands of such as do not passe for theyr owne saluation, muche lesse for others: therfore with great and spedy dilygence the magistrats are bound (scyng god dothe put them in trust with hys chyldren) to prouide, that as they be bought with the bloud of Chryst, so they may be nourished with the true and sincere word of god, to the praise of his name, and theyr eternall comfort. Further who can not lament, euen from the botom of his harte, to see a great number to lyue in such carelesnes, and flatter themselues in theyr owne sinnes, thinkinge that they be the chyldren of God, when as in very dede the comfortable spirit of faythfull prayer is departed from them, and they worthely numbred amongst them that haue no God nor Chryst: As those men be, whiche be so greedy vpon the world, and haue addicte and consecrate themselues vnto it, after suche a forte, as though thys worlde should last for eucr: And in this takyng be the grea ter part of the gentelmen, which with suche extremities intreate 
                        〈◊〉
                      poore tenantes, with raysyng of rents, taking of synes, and other kyndes of extreme dealinges, that they are compelled day and nighte to crie vnto God for vengeaunce against them: and can any man thinke that these pitiles and cruell men, can appeare before the maiestie of god, and craue remission of theyr sinnes, when as they be purposed to go on forwarde still in their extreme dealinges against the poore? I will not speake nowe of them, that beyng not content with theyr landes and rentes, do catche into theyr hands spiritual liuyngs: as personages & such lyke, and that vnder the pretense to make prouision for theyr houses. What hurt and domage thys realme of England doth sustayne by that deuelyshe kynde of prouision for gentelmens houses, knightes and Lords houses, they cantel best that do trauell in the countreyes, and see with their cyes, great parishes and market townes, with innumerable others, to be 
                        〈◊〉
                      destitute of Gods word, and that because that these greedy men haue spoyled the lyuings and gotten them into theyr hands: and in stead of a faythful & painfull teacher they hyre a sir John, which hath better skill in playing at tables, or in kepyng of a garden, then in Gods word, & he for a triefle doth serue the cure, and so help to bring the people of God in daunger of theyr soules. And all those serue to accomplishe the abhominable pryde of suche gentelmen, which cōsume the goods of the poore (the which ought to haue ben bestowed vppon a lerned minister) in costly apparel, belly chere, or in building of gorgious houses. But let thē be assured, that a day will come when it will be layd to theyr charge: Rapina pauperū in domibus vestris, And then they shall perceaue that theyr faire houses ar built in the place called Aceldama: they haue a bloudy foundation and therfore can not stād long. This matter also is so wayghtye, and the spirituall slaughter of the poore people so miserable and wofull, that except the magistrates spedely looke thereunto, and redres the same, the Lorde of Sabaoth hymself will synde oute som remedy to delyuer his people from suche cater pillers, and requyre the bloud of his people at theyr hāds, by whose couetousnes they were letted to come to the knowledge of Christ. And besides thys suche

                      wolues as deuoure the lyuings of teachers, & ministers of gods word, shall not be hable to come in the presence of the Lord, to pray vnto hym or to prayse hym: for all that euer they doo (yea euen their prayers) is execrable before the Lord, so long as they turne their eare fro the heating of the lawe of the Lorde: that is to saye, so longe as they doo not euen from the verye 
                        〈◊〉
                      of theyr hartes,

                      aboute to redresse

these heynous faultes with the which they be intangled. Let them repēt therfore euen

                     , before the wrathfull indignation of the Lord faule vppon them, and so destroy them in theyr sinnes. And these thyngs ought to be considered of all them that pretende christianytie, of what estate or degree soeuer they be, as well lawyers (whose couetousnes hath almost deuoured England) as craftesmen, husbandmen, seruauntes and others, remembryng with them selues, that if theyr hartes be inclined to wickednes, the Lorde will not heare theyr prayers. Let them stand in awe of the Lorde theyr God, and so behaue themselues in theyr conuersation and life, that they may haue recourse vnto him, and be incoraged to make theyr praiers cōsidētly before him in the name of Iesus Christ, of whom they shall receaue comfort of soule and body, as well in this world as in the world to come eternally. For this is most certayne, that if they procede in their wickednes and vngodlynes, not passying wheather they be ruled, moued, and stirred by the gratious spirit of God to praise his name or not: then most assuredly the Lord wil power out his plages vpon thePsalme. lxxix hole realme, according to the saying of the Prophet: the Lord will power out his wrath vpon the kingdoms that haue not called vppon his name.
                  Now to the intent that they which are ignoraunt and vnlerned may the better be instracted howe to order themselues when they go about to present themselues before the maiestye of God, and talke with hym concernyng those thinges whiche be nedefull for theyr soules health, and preseruation of their bodyes: I thought it good (by the instant request of the godly learned) to put fourth these sermons here folowing, in print, which were preached in king Edwards 
                        〈◊〉
                     , before the right honorable ladye Katheryne Duches of Suffolke her grace, by that same reuerend sather and most constant martyr of Chryste, Doctor Hughe Latymer, my most deere master. For whose most paynfull trauels, faythful 
                        〈◊〉
                     , trew carefulnes for his countrey, pacient imprisōment, and constant suffering. all the whole realme of England, hathe great cause to geue vnto the eternall God most high laude and prayse, For who is he that is so ignorante that did not see the wonderfull handiworke of God in that man? did not God appoint him euē in king Kenries dayes, to be a singular instrument to set forth hys truth, & by his preachyng to open the eyes of such as were deluded by the subtyll and deccatfull craftes of the popish presates?
                  How many fold wayes was he troubled, toste, and tormoyled from poste to piller, by the popish by shops? Whose handes he could not haue escaped if God had not moued the kinges maiesties hart (that then was) to assist hym. By whose absolute power diucrse times he was deliuered from the cruell Lyons. And although it did please God, in proces of tyme to suffer the kyngs 
                        〈◊〉
                      to be deluded and circumuented by the subtyl 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     D. Latiuier withstode the sixe articles although they were confirmed by lawes. sions of those popish by shops, to establish by lawe syxs vngodly articles: Yet thys faythfull seruaunt of Chryste woulde rather put hys owne lyfe in daunger, then forsake or depart from that, the which afore most faithfully he had taught out of Gods worde. Wherfore he was contented ra ther to be cast into the Tower, and there to loke dayly for death, then to be found a wauering reede, or to deceane hys Prynce. For they (sayd he) that doo allow any thyng disagreing from Gods word, in respecte to fulfill the appetites of Princes, ar betraiers & murtherers of their princes. because they prouoke the wrathe of God to destroy suche princes: & these

slatterers become gilty of the blood of their princes, and are the chiefs causes of their destructions. Wherefore this faythfull man or god, knowing his prince to be deluded by the false priests and bemge assureb the thinges that were allowed to be contrary to gods word, was redy thus to aduenture his lyfe: at the which time god mercifully deliuered him, to the great comfort of al godly harts, and singuler cōmodity of his church.
                  Now whē he was thus deliuered, did he giue himself vp to yt pleasures of the world? to delicatenes or idlenes? No assuredly, but euen then most of al he began to set fourth his plough, & to till the ground of the lord, and to 
                        〈◊〉
                      the good corne of gods word, behauing him self as a faythful messenger of god, being afrayed of no man, telling all degrees theire dueties faithfully and truely, without respect of persons, or any kind of flattery. In the whiche his paynefull trauels he continued al kinge Edwardes time, preaching for the most part euery sondaye twoo sermons to the great shame, confusion, and 
                        〈◊〉
                      of a great number of our fatbellied vnpreaching prelats. For he beinge a sore brused man and aboue three score & 7 yeres of age, took notwithstanding at these paines in preching, and besides this, euery morning ordinarily, winter and sommer, aboute two of the clock in the morning, he was at his booke most diligētly. And besides this how carefull he was for the preseruation of the churche of God, and for the good successe of the gospel, they can bcare record. which at that time were in autoritye whome continually by his letters he admonished of their 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and assisted with his godly counsel.
                  But when the time approched, 
                        〈◊〉
                      which god had appoynted for the punishmēt of the carnal gospcllers & hipocrited which most wickedly abused the same, how faythfully he did 
                        〈◊〉
                      both prinatly, and open ly al kinds of men, they that wer then about him can beare record. But one thing amongest others is principally to be noted, that god not onelye gaue vnto him his sprit most plentiously and comfortably, to preach hys word vnto his 
                        〈◊〉
                     : but also by the same spirite he did most 
                        〈◊〉
                      prophecy of al those kindes of plages, which in very dede afterwards en sued, so playnly I say, as thoughe he had seene them before hys eyes so that, if England euer had a Prophet, he was one. 
                        〈◊〉
                      amongst other things he euer affirmed that the preaching of the gospel would cost hym his life, to yt which thing he did most cherefully arme & prepare him self, being certenly perswaded, that Winchest. was kept in the tower for the same purpose. Therefore not long after Quene Mary was proclamed, a pursiuant was sent down into the country for to call hym vp. Of whose cōming when he was made ware about six howers before, by a faythful man of god Ioha Carelesse (a mā worthy of euerlasting memory) he pre pared himself towards hys iorney before the sayd pursiuant came to his house. At yt which thing, whē the pursiuāt marueled seing him so prepa red towards his iorney he sayd vnto him, my frend: you be a welcō mes senger to me, and be it known vnto you & to the whole world, that I go as willingly to Lōdon at this presēt, being called by my prince to render a reckning of my doctrin, as euer I was to any place in the world, and I do not dout, but that god, as he hath made me worthy to preach hys word before two excellēt princes, so he wil able me to witnesse the same vnto the third, eyther to her comfort, or discomforte eternally &c. At the which tune the pursiuant, when he had deliuered hys letters departed,

                     
                        〈◊〉
                      that he had commaundeniēt not to tary for him, by whose sodē departure it was manifest, that they would not haue had him to appere, but rather to haue fled out of the realm. They knew that his cōstantnes should cōfound them in their popery, and confirm the godly in the truth. As concerning the maner and forme how he was interteyned when he came before the counsell, how stoutly he did behaue himselfe in Christes cause, and was content to beare most paciently all the mocks and tan̄tes geuen him by the scornful, and pestilent papists: also howe pacientlye he tooke his imprisonment, and how boldly and willingly he in the end aduentured his life in the defence of the glorious gospel of Iesus Christe, because theise thinges be at large described in the booke of the martyrs by that most godly lerned and excellent instrument of God master Iohn Fox, I wil not spend the time now to reherse the same: sauing one thing the which I would wishe all godly bishops and faythfull preachers to note, the which is this: that he being in prison comfortles, and destitute of all worldly help. most of al did reioyce in this, that god had geuen him grace, to aply his office of preching & assisted him without fear or flattry to tel vnto the wicked theyr faultes, & admonish thē of their wickednes, neyther alowing, nor consenting to any thing, that might be preiudicial or hurtfull vnto the gospell of Christe, although the refusall thereof did cast him in daunger of his life. God graunt that al those that be in that of fice may folow his footesteppes, and that the reste that eyther refuse to take payns, or are giuen to flatter, may be turned out, and be set to the cart or plough, and others put into their romes that be willing, diligent and hable to do their dewties. The other thinge that I would haue no ted, is his 
                        〈◊〉
                      and diligence in prayer, wherin oftentimes so long he continued kneeling, that he was not able for to rise without helpe: & amongst other thinges these were thre principal matters he prayed for. The first, that as god had appoynted him to be a precher and professor of his word, so also he would 
                        〈◊〉
                      him grace to stand vnto his doctrine vntil his death: Thother thing, the which most instantly with great vi olēce of gods sprite he desired, was that god of his mercy wold restore the gospell of his sonne Christ vnto thys realm of England once again, and these wordes once agayn, once agayn, he did so inculcate and beat into the cares of the Lord god, as though he had sene god before him, & spake vnto him face to face. The thirde principall matter wherewith in his prayers he was 
                        〈◊〉
                      was to praye for the preseruation of the quenes maiesty that now is, whome in his prayer accustomablye he was wont to name, and euen with teares desired god to make her a comfort to this comfortles realm of England. These wer the matters he prayed for so earnestly. But were these things desired in vayne? Did god despise the prayers of this his faythfull souldier? No assuredly: for the lord did most graciously graunt all these his requests. First, concerning profession, euen in the most extremity, the Lord 
                        〈◊〉
                      assisted him. For whē he stode at the stake, without Bocardo gare at Oxford, & the tormen 
                        〈◊〉
                      about to set the fire vpon him and that most reuerēd father D. Rid ley, he lifted vp his eyes towardes heuen with a most amiable and 
                        〈◊◊〉
                     , saying these words. Fidelis est Deus, qui non 
                        〈◊〉
                      nos tentari supra id quod possumus. God is faythful, which doth not suffer vs to be tempted aboue our strength: and so afterwarde by and by

shed his bloud in the cause of christ, the which bloud ranne out of his hart in suche aboundaunce that all those that wer presente (beyng godly) dyd maruell to see the most part of the bloud in his body so to be gathered to his hart, and with suche violence to gushe out, his body being opened by the force of the fyre. By the which thinge God most gratiously graunted his request, the which was, to shede his harts bloud in the defence of the Gospell. How mercifully the Lorde heard his second request, in restoring his gospel once again to this realm, these present dais can beare recorde. But alasse, what shal England say for her defēce, how shal she auoyd the terrible plages of God for the horrible and deuelish vnthanckfulnes, for that treasure? The Lorde be mercifull vnto vs.
                  Now concernyng his third request, it was also most effectuously graunted to the grent prayse of God, the furtheraunce of his Gospel, and to the vnspeakenble comfort of this realme. For when matters were euen desperate, and the enemies mightely florished and triumphed, Gods worde banished, 
                        〈◊◊〉
                     , sodenly the Lorde called to remembran̄ce his mercy, and made an end of all these miseries, and appoynted her, for whom that same gray headed father Latimer so earnestly prayed in hys 
                        〈◊〉
                     , as the true & naturall ruler, & owner of this imperial 
                        〈◊〉
                      to shew her 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and by the brightnes of Gods worde to confounde the darke, 
                        〈◊〉
                      and

The selfe same God graunt vnto euery faythfull Christiar: his spirit, that they may be diligēt and watchfull in prayers for her, by whom God hath bestowed such vnspeakcable giftes vpon vs, that the same God will assyste her with hys grace and holy spirite, to procede faythfullye in the building of his house, and in plucking downe of all kyndes of synne and

                     OVR FATHER vvhich art in heauen. I haue entred of late in the wase of preachyng, and spoken many thynges of prayer, and rather of praier than of any other thing. For I thinke there is nothing more necessarie to be spoken of, nor more abused than praier was by the craft and suttletie of the deuill: for many thynges were taken for prayer whan they were nothyng lesse. Therefore at this same 
                           〈◊〉
                         also I haue thoughte it good to entreate of prayer, to thintent that it might bee knowen what a precious thyng ryghte prayer is. I tolde you first what prayer is. Secondarily, to whom we ought to praye. Thirdely, where and in what place we ought to pray. And fourthely I tolde you the diuersitie of prayer, namely of the common prayer and the priuate. These and such lyke thynges I haue dilated and cxpounded vnto you of late in the open pulpet.
                     Nowe at this present tyme I 
                           〈◊〉
                         as by the way of a lecture, at the request of my most gracious Lady, to expoūd vnto you, (her housholde seruantes, and other that be willing to heare) the right vnderstandyng and meaning of this most perfect prayer, which our sauior hymself taught vs, at the request of his disciples, which prayer we call the Pater noster. This prayer of our lorde maye be called a prayer aboue all prayers, the principall and moste perfect prayer, whyche prayer ought to be regarded aboue all others, consideryng that our Sauior hym selfe is the author of it, he was the maker of this prayer, beeyng very God and very man.

sonne of GOD by nature, we be his sonnes by adoption thorough his goodnesse, therefore be biddeth vs to call hym our Father, which is to be had in freshe memory, and great reputation. For here we are admonished howe that we bee reconciled vnto God: we which before tymes were his enemies, are made nowe the children of GOD, and inheritoures of euerlasting lyfe. Thus we be admonished by this woorde Father. So that it is a woorde of muche importance and great reputation: For it confyrmeth our fayth, whan we call him

Whan we be in trouble we doute of a straunger whether he wil helpe vs or not: but our sauiour commaundyng vs to call God father, teacheth vs to be assured of the loue and good will of GOD towarde vs. So by this woorde Father, we learne to stablish and to comforte oure saythe: knowyng moste assuredlye that he wyl be good vnto vs. For Christ was a perfecte schoolemaister, he lacked no wysedome, he knewe his Fathers wyll and pleasure: he teacheth vs, yea and moste certainely assureth vs, that GOD will be no cruell iudge, but a louyng Father. Here we see what commodities we haue in this word Father. Seyng no we that we fynde suche commodities by this one word, we ought to consider the whole praier withNo vvorde in this prai er

For there is no worde nor letter conteined in this prayer, but it is of great importance and waighte, therfore it is necessarye for vs to knowe and to vnderstande it thoroughlye, and thanne to speake it consideratelye wyth greate deuotion: elles it is to no purpose to speake the woordes withoute vnderstandyng, it isNote what lyplabour is. but lyplabour and vayne bablying, and so vnworthy to bee called prayer (as it was in tymes

                         vsed in Englande.) Therefore whenne you saye thys prayer, you muste well consyder what you saye. For it is better once sayde deliberately with vnderstandyng, then a thousand times without vnderstanding, which is in very dede but vain babling: and

so more a displeasure than pleasure vnto God. For the mat ter lyeth not in muche sayeng, but in well saying. So if it be sayd to the honor of God, than it hath his effect, and we shall haue our petitions, for God is trewe in his promises: and our Sauior knowing him to be well affected towardes vs, commaundeth vs therefore to calle hym Father.
                     Here you must vnderstande, that lyke as our Sauior was most earnest and feruent in teachyng vs

                         to pray and call vpon God for ayde and helpe, and for thynges necessarieThe deuill is diligēt to let praier. both to our soules and bodies: So the deuill that old serpent, with no lesse diligence endeuoreth himselfe to let and stoppe our prayers: so that we shall not cal vpon god. And amongest other his lettes, he hath one especially, where with he thynketh to keepe vs from prayer, whiche is the remembraunce of our synnes. When he perceiueth vs to be disposed to praye, he commeth with his crafte and suttle conueiaunces, saying: What, wylte thou praye vnto god for aide and helpe? knowest thou not that thou art a wicked synner and a transgressour of the law of God? Looke rather to beeThe slights of the deuil damned and iudged for thy yll doynges, than to receiue any benefite at his handes. Wylt thou call him father whiche is so holye a god? and thou art so wicked, and miserable a synner? This the deuill will saye, and trouble our myndes to stoppe and let vs from our prayer: and so to giue vs occasion not to praye vnto god. In this temptatiō we must secke for some remedy and comfort, for the deuil doth put vs in remē
                        braunce of our sinnes to that ende, to keeye vs from prayer and inuocation of GOD. The remedye for this temptation is to call our Sauiour to remembraunce, who hath taughte vs to say this prayer: he knew his fathers pleasure, he knew what he did. Whan he commaunded vs to call GOD oure Father, he knew we should fynde fatherly affections in god towardes vs. Call this (I saye) to remembraunce, and than agayn remember that our Sauiour hath cleansed, thorough his passion, all our synnes, and taken away all our wickednesse. So that as many as beleue in hym shalbe the children of God. In suche wise lette vs striue and fyghte agaynst the temptacions of the deuill, which would not haue vs to call vpon god: because we be synners. Catche thou holde of out

sauior, beleue in hym, be assured in thy hearte that he with his sufferyng toke away all thy synnes. Consider agayne, that our Sauiour calleth vs to prayer, and commaundeth vs to praye: Our synnes lette vs, and withdrawe vs from prayer, but our sauiour maketh them nothyng: whan wee beleeue in hym, it is lyke as if we hadde no synnes. For he chaungeth with vs, he taketh our synnes and wickednesse frome vs, and geueth vnto vs his holynesse, rightuousnes, iustice, fulfyllyng of the lawe, and so consequentely euerlastyng lyfe: So that we 
                           〈◊〉
                         lyke as if we hadde doone no synne at all: for his ryghtuousnesse standeth vs in so good steade, as though we of our owne selues had fulfylled the lawe to the vttermoste.
                     Therfore our synnes can not lette vs, nor withdraw vs from prayer: for they be gone, they are no synnes, they can not be hurtfull vnto vs. Christ dyeng for vs, as al the scripture both of the new and old testament witnesseth: Dolores nostros ipse portauit, He hath taken away our sorowes.

In suche dystresse cometh a good frende, and sayth: Syr, bee of good cheere, I will paye thy dettes, and foorthwith payeth the wholle summe, and setteth me at libertie. Suche a frende is our Sauiour, he hath payde our dettes, and sette vs at libertie, els we should haue ben damned worlde withoute end in euerlastyng prison and darknesse.

Qui es in coelis, which art in heauen. These wordes put a diuersitye betwene the heauenly father, and oure temporall fathers. There be some temporall fathers which would fayne helpe their children, but they can not, they bee not able to helpe them. Agayne there bee some fathers whiche are ryche and myght helpe their children, but they be so vnnaturall they wyll not helpe them. But oure heauenlye Father, in that we call hym Father, we learne that he wyl helpe, that he beareth a fatherlye loue towardes vs.

So it appeareth that he is a Father whiche will help, and that he beyng celelestiall, whyche is able to helpe vs. Therfore we maye haue a boldenesse and confidence, that he maye helpe vs, and that he wyll helpe vs, where and whensoeuer we call. he sayth: Coelum & terram impleo. I syll heauen and earthe. And agayneHie. 23. Coelum mihi sedes est, & terta scabellum pedum meorum,Esa 66. Heauen is my seate, and the earth is my footestoole. Where we see that he is a mighty GOD, that he is in heauen and earthe with his power and might. In heauen he is apparantly, where face to face he sheweth himself vnto his Angels and Saines. In earth he is not so apparantly, but darkelye and obscurelye he exhibiteth himselfe vnto vs: for oure corrupte and feble fleshe coulde not beare hys maiestye:VVhy god is not appa rantly vpō, earthe.

Therefore we muste learne to persuade our selues, and vndoutedlye beleue that he is able to helpe: and that he beareth a good and fatherly wyll towardes vs, that he will not forgette vs. Therfore the king and prophet Dauid sayth, Dominus de coelo prospexit, The Lorde hath seene doune from heauen.

heauen: they be spurre blynde, and sande blynd. they can not see so farre, nor haue not so long eares to heare. And therefore our petition and prayer shoulde bee vnto hym, whyche wyll heare, and can heare. For it is the Lorde that looketh downe. He is here in earth (as I tolde you) verye darkely, but he is in heauen moste manifestely: where he sheweth him 
                           〈◊〉
                         vnto his angels and sayntes face to face. We reade in Scripture that Abels bloode dydde crie vntoGene 4 God: where it appeareth that he can heare, yea not onelyGod heard the crye

Therfore ponder and consyder these wordes well, for they fortifie oure saythe. We call hym Father, to put our selues in remembraunce of his good wylle towardes vs. Heauenly we calle hym, signifying his myghte and power that he maye healpe and doo all thynges accordynge to his wyll and pleasure. So it appereth moste manifestly, that there lacketh neither good will nor power in hym. There was ones a prophete whiche whan he was yll intreated of kyng Ioas, sayde: Dominus videat &

Let vs therfore take hede that we doo nothyng that myght displease his maiestie, neither openly nor secretely. For he is euery where, and nothyng can be hyd from hym, Vider & requiret, He seeth it, and will punishe it.
                     Further this worde Father is not onely apt and conuenient for vs to strengthen oure faith withall (as I tolde you) but also it moueth God the sooner to heare vs when we callAn other commoditie of this worde Father. him by that name Father. For he perceiuing our confidence in him, can not chose but shew hym lyke a Father. So that this word Father is most mete to moue god to pitie, and to graunt oure requestes. Certaine it is, and proued by holy Scripture, that God hath a fatherly and louyng affection

Therfore let euerye man thinke lowly of himselfe, humble himselfe, and call vpon god, which is redye to geus vs, not onely bread and drinke, or other necessaries, but the holye ghoste: to whome will he geue the holye ghoste, to lordes and ladies? to gentilmen or gentilwomen?

Poscentibus (sayeth he,) vnto those whiche call vppon hym, beyng riche or poore, lordes or kinghtes, beggers or ryche, he is redy to geue vnto them whanne they come to him.

                     But one worde is lefte whiche we must needes consyder. Noster, oure, he sayeth not my, but our. wherfore sayeth he, our? This woorde our teacheth vs to consyder that the Father

                     Here may we perceiue what communion is betwene vs, so that when I praye, I pray not for my selfe alone, but for all the reste: Agayne, when they praye, they praye not for themselues onely, but for me: for Christ hath so framed this prayer, that I muste needes include my neighbour in it. Therfore all those which pray this prayer, they pray as welChristvvold haue oure praiers cō

For amongest suche a great numbre there be some which be good, and whose prayer God will heare. As it appeared by Abrahams prayer, whiche prayer was so

                        . Which saying I lyke not very well. For our sauiour

was better learned than sainct Chrysostome. He taught vs to praye in common for all: therfore we ought to folow him and to be glad to pray one for an other. For we haue a common sayeng amongest vs: Who so euer loueth me, louethA prouerbe loue me loue my hounde. my hounde. So who so euer loueth God, wil loue his neigh bor, which is made after the image of God.
                     And here is to be noted that prayer hath one propretie before all other good workes: for with my almes I healpe but one or two at ones, but with my faithful prayer I help all.The propertie of praier. I desire God to cōfort al men liuing, but specially domesticos fidei, those which be of yt houshold of god. Yet we ought to pray with all our heartes for the other which beleue not, that God wil turne their heartes and renew them with his spirite: yea our prayer reacheth so far, that our very capitall ennemie oughte not to bee omitted. Here you see whatThe excellency of praier. an excellent thyng prayer is, whanne it proceedeth frome a faithfull heart, it dooth farr passe all the good workes that men can doo.
                     Now to make an ende, we are monished here of charitie, and taught, that God is not only a priuate father, but a cō

Therfore like as they were made iust before god, so may we too, for we haue euen the self same promise. Let vs therfore folow their ensample, let vs forsake all sinnes and wickednesse: than god will heare our praiers. for Scripture saithe, Dominus facit quicquid volunt timentes eum, & clamorem eorum exaudit ac seruat eos, The Lorde fulfylleth the desyre of theim that feare hym, he also wyll heare theyr crye, and healpePsal. 145. theym. In an other place he saythe: Si manseritis in sermone meo, & verba mea custo diueritis quicquid volueritis petentes accipietis, If ye abyde in me, and my woordes abyde in you, aske what ye will, and it shall be done for you.

Remembre what is ment by this worde Our, namely that it admonysheth vs of loue and charitie, it teacheth vs to be ware of stubburnesse and proudnesse, consyderyng that God loued as well the begger as the ryche man: for he regardeth no persones. Agayne, what is to bee vnderstand by this woorde Father, namely that he beareth a good wyll towardes vs, that he is redy and willyng to healpe vs. Heauenly, that admonisheth vs of his potencie and abilitie, that he is ruler ouer al thinges.

For it is a great helpe vnto vs, and strengtheth muche our faithe, so that we may be assured, that euery good mā in the whole world wil pray for vs and with vs, whiles we haue one father, and one maner of prayer. And this woorde Our, putteth vs in remembrance that we bee bretherne in Christe: where we be admonished to despise no man, be he neuer soPrinces and plovvmen are al made of one matter. miserable or poore, for we haue all one Father, which hath made vs all of one mettall of earth. So that the hygheste prince in the world is made as wel of earth, as the poorest, and so shal turne into the same again as well as the poorest shepard. Let these proude persons marke this well, which be euer ready to despise euery man. Suche proude persons say neuer the Lordes prayer with good mynde: yea God is not their Father. For he abhorreth all prowdnes, therforeThe proud mās father is in hell. suche stubborne folowes whan they wyll praye, they should not say, Our father which art in heauen, but rather, Oure father whiche art in helle. God is their Father, as concernyng their substaunce, for he geueth them soules and bodies: but they make theim selues the membres of the deuyll, contrarye vnto goddes will and pleasure.

Here I tolde you wherein standeth the holines of his name, & what it meaneth namely we requyre yt his name may be sanctified in vs, that is to say, we requyre that all oure conuersati ons maye be to the honour of God: which foloweth whan we indeuour our selues to doe his pleasure, whan we heare hys worde with great diligence, and earnest reuerence, and so walke in the workes of our vocation euery man whereunto God hath appointed him. And because the worde of God is the instrumente and fountayne of all good thinges, we praye to god for the continuance of his worde, that he wyll sende godly and well learned men amongest vs, which may be able to declare vs his will and pleasure. So that we may glorifye hym in the honour of our visitation, when god shal visite vs, and rewarde euery one according vnto his desert.
                     One thing we must well consider and not forget it, namelyeVVe must not forget that vve are able to do nothing of our selfe, ac cording to gods vvill. that our sauiour teacheth vs to praye and desire of God that his name may bee halowed.

So yt when I say this praier, I require god that he wil let his kingdom come to you, as well as to me. Again when you pray, you pray as well for me as for your owne selues.
                     Let thy kingdome come. You muste vnderstande that to speake properly, these wordes are not to bee vnderstande of godnes inferiour kyngdome, of his earthlye kyngdome, asVVhat king dome it is that we

I would wishe of god that all kynges and potentates in the world would consider this well, and so endeuor themselues to vse their power to the honor and glory of god, and not to presume in their strength. For this is a good monition for them, when god saith: per me reges regnant, Thorough me kynges do reigne: yet they bee so vnder gods rule, that they canne thynke nothing nor do any thing withoute GoddesProuer. 2. permission. For it is written: Cor regis in manu domini & A good les son for sub iectes. quo vult vertit illud. The heart of the king is in the hand of the lord, and he turneth the same whether soeuer it pleaseth him. This is good to be considered, and specially subiectes shoulde marke this texte well, whan the rulers bee harde, and oppresse the people, thinke euer: Cor

Ther fore yelde obedience, make thy mone vnto GOD, and he wyll helpe, and canne helpe. Surelye I thynke there bee no place in scripture more pleasaunte than thys.

                     After those came the Persians, which were greate rulers and mightye kynges, as it appeareth by stories written of learned men at that tyme.

The Ba bilonians, Persians and Grecians (and a good parte of the Romaines) were caste doune for wickednesse sake. what were their doinges? they would not execute instice: the magistrates were wicked, lofty, and high mynded. The subiectes taking ensample of their magistrates, were wicked too, and so worthy to be punished together. Therfore the wysedome of god sayeth, Vidi sub sole in loco iuditii impietatē & Eccle. 3. in loco iustitiae iniquitatē, in ye place where poore men ought to be herd, there I haue sene impiety, I haue sene

So ought all preachers to do,Luc 10. they ought to allure euery man to come to this kyngdome,Luc, 9. that this kyngdom may be replenished. For the more that beThe

To this heauenly kyngdome our sauioure exhorteth vs, sayeng: Querite primum regnum Dei & iustitiam eius, & caetera omnia aducientur vobis, Seeke first the kyngdome of god and his rightuousnesse, and all other thinges shall come vpon you vnloked for. Cast all thy care vpon god, as Dauid saith: Iacta super dominum curam tuā. ThenPsal. 54. our principall studie shalbe to heare gods worde, and whanTvvo com modities that come of casting our care vp pon God. we haue

                         beleue it and folowe it, euery man in his vocation. Then seruants shall yeld their obedience to their maisters, as god requireth of thē. Thē the parentes shal bryng vp their chyldren in the feare of god. Than the children shall be obedient to their parentes. Then subiects shall be obedient to their kyng and prince, and all his officers vnder hym. So goe thorough out all estates, euery one shall lyue vpryghtely in his callyng, than god wyll blesse vs, so that we shall not lacke necessaries in this worlde: and than at the ende we shall come to that perfect

                         and ioy that god hath layd vp and prepared for them that studie here to lyue accordyng to his will and commaundemente. But we must labour and trauaile as long as we be in this worlde:2. Tess 3. we muste be occupied. For saint Paule sayth: Si quis nonPsal. 127. vult operari, nec manducet, Who soeuer wil not labour, letw hiles vve shall be in this lifevve must labor and

For he that wil labour, and is contente to trauaile for his lyuing, god will prosper hym, he shall not lacke. Lette euery man therefore laboure in his

                         he hath ben in his office, it appereth euery where. For

For he sayth, standyng before Pylate, Regnum meum non est de hoc mundo, My kyngdome is not of this worlde. He reignethIoh. 18. by faith thorough his holy ghoste, in all those whiche pertain vnto hym. He is not an earthly kyng

                         the Jewes hope to haue their Messias. Therfore whan I fele such motions within me than is it tyme to call vpon God: for sucheVVe must flye to god for reskue. motions come of the deuill, therfore I must tunne to God, sayeng: Thy kyngdom come moste louyng father: healpe thou, fyght thou for me agaynst my enemies, suffre me not to be taken prisoner: lette not my

                        . For you may be sure, we shall neuer bee without battaile & trauaile, and we are not able to withstande our aduersarie by oure owne power. Therfore it is most nedefull for vs to call and crye vnto hym for helpe: When we doo so, than we shall haue grace to withstande the deuyll. For he can not, neither is he able to striue with God for all hisProuer 21 crafte. For Scripture sayth: Non est consilium contra dominum,None can

                         thynketh himselfe cocksure, than GOD commeth and subuerteth his wycked intentes, as it appeared in our sauiour hymselfe. For when the deuyll had brought the Iewes to suche a madnes, that they wente and crucified hym: whan this was 
                           〈◊〉
                        , the deuyll triumphed and made mery: he thought hymselfeThe deuils triumphe is

                         sure mough of hym. But what was the ende of it? his triumphyng was turned to his owne destruction. For Christe hangyng vppon the Crosse, dyd by his deathe destroye the power of the deuyll. So wee see howe GOD suffereth the deuyll for a whyle, and then when he seeth his tyme, he commeth wyth hys gracious helpyng hande. But as I told you before, the diuell hath many inuentions, many impedimentes

and lettes wherewith he trappeth vs. For we see there bee a great many gospellers whiche begunne very wellA note

                     But what than? God wyll preserue hys kyngdome: he wil wrastle wyth the deuylles kyngdome, and so shall preuayle and pull it downe to the bottome. Therfore all those whiche bee in the kyngdome of GOD must wrastle, stryue and fighte with the diuell: not as the carnall gospellers doe, whicheCarnal gos pellers. commonly begyn wel at the

These bee the wordes of God whyche he speaketh agaynst the wycked, and it must nedes be so, but yet we see by experience dayely the contrary.

blessed, and all thynges shall goe welle with them. Nowe, howe chaunceth it, that we see dayly the wycked to be blessed of God, to haue and possesse his benefites, and the good to bee cursed? whyche is a wonderfull thyng.

For of oure owne selues we are not able to doc any thing acceptable vnto hym. And thys is a good doctryne whyche admonisheth vs to geue all praise vnto God, and not to ascribe it to our owne selues.

And here appeareth the ryght humiliation, and lowlynes, whyche oure sausour teacheth vs in thys petition. For he woulde haue vs to know our owne impossibilitye and vnablenesse to doe any thyng. And than agayn he would haue vs to call for ayde and helpe to God, therefore he teacheth vs to say, A du eniat regnum tuum, Thy kyngdome come. So that thoughe we bee not able thorough oure owne selues to do any thyng, yet whan we call vpon hym, he wyll helpe. For Christ knewe his fathers wyll and louing affections towardes vs: he knewe that he woulde helpe vs. For he was a perfecte scholemaister, els he would not haue commaū ded vs to praye: Fiat voluntas tua. Thy wyll bee done. Here we must vnderstand that the wyll of god is to bee consydered after two sortes. First, as it is omnipotent, vnsercheable, andGods vvill must be con sidered after

                            sor c. s. that can not be knowen vnto vs. Nowe we do not praye that hys wyll so consydered be done. For his wyll so considered is and euer shalbe fulfylled, though we would say nay to it. For

nothyng either in heauen or in earth is able to withstand his wille. Wherfore it were but folye for vs to praye to haue it fulfilled otherwise then to shew thereby that we 
                           〈◊〉
                         oure consent to hys wyll, whyche is to vs vnsearcheable.
                     But there is an other consyderation of Gods wyll, and in that consideration, we and all faithfull christians desire that it maye bee done. And so consydered, it is called a reueled, a manifested, and declared will: and it is opened vnto vs in the Bible in the newe and olde testament. There GOD hathe reueled a certayne wille, therefore we praye that it maye bee doone, and fulfylled of vs. This wyll was opened byGods will was ope ned by Mo ses, the Pro phetes Christ and the Apostles.

Now the first and principall thing that we haue nede of in this lyfe, is the magistrates, without a magistrate we should neuer liue well and quietly. Than it is necessary and moste nedefull to praye vnto god for them, that the people may haue rest, and apply their busines, euery man in his callyng, the husbandman in tillyng and plowing, the artificer in his busines. For you must euer consider, that where warre is, there be all discommodities, no man can doe his duetie accordyng vnto his callyng, as it appeareth now in Germany, the Emperour & the Frenche king being at controuersy: I warrant you there is litle reste, or quietnes.

                     They that be children, and lyue vnder the rule of theyr parentes, or haue tutōrs, they praye in this petition for theyr pa rentes, and tutors. For they be necessary for theyr brynging vp. And god will accept their prayer as well as theyrs which be of age. for god hath no respecte of persons: he is as redye toGod respe cteth no persons.

Let parentes and tutors do their dueties to bryng theym vp so, that as soone as theyr age serueth, they may tast and sauour god: let them feare god in the beginning, and so they shall do also whan they be olde. Because I speake here of Orphans, I shall exhorte you to be pitiful vnto them, for it is a thyng that pleased god, as S. Iames witnesseth, saying: Religio pura. &c.

S. Anthony perceiuing that, came to knowledge of himself, and layd away all pride and presumption.

For those that bee single haue more liberties to praye and to serue god, then the other, for they that be maried haue muche trouble and afflictions in their bodies. This I speake because I heare that some there bee whiche condemne single lyfe: I would haue them to knowe that matrimonye is good, godlye, and allowable vnto all men, yet for al that, the singule life ought not to be despised, or condemned, seyng that Scripture alloweth it: yea and he affirmeth that it is better than matrimony if it be cleane without sinne and offence.
                     Further we pray here in this petition for good seruantes,VVe praye for trustye and true ser uantes. that god will send vnto vs good faithful and trusty seruantes for they are necessarye for this bodelye lyfe that our businesse may be done, and those whiche liue in single lyfe haue more nede of good trustye seruauntes, than those whiche are maried. Those which are maried can better ouersee their seruanntes. For whan the man is from home at the least the wyfe ouerseeth them and kepeth them in good order. For I tell youSeruauntes must bee ouerseene. seruauntes must be ouersene and looked to, yf they be not ouersene what be they? it is a great gifte of god to haue a good seruaunt. For the most part of seruantes are but eye seruantes: whan their maister is gon, they leaue of from their labor, and play the sluggardes, but such seruauntes do contrary vnto gods commaundement, and shal be damned in hel for their slouthfulnes, except they repente. Therfore (I say) those that be vnmaried haue more nede of good seruauntes, than those which be maried, for one of them at the least may alwayes ouersee the family. For as I tolde you before, the most part of seruāts be eye seruants, they be nothing whan they be not ouersene. There was once a felowe asked a philosopher a questiō

In likemaner those that haue seruants must not only commaund them what they shall do, but they must see that it be done: they muste bee present, or els it shall neuer be doone.

                     It is no light matter that god pronounceth them to be cursed. But what is cursed? what is it? Cursed is as much to say as it shal not go wel with them, they shal haue no lucke, my face shalbe against them. Is not this a great thyng? Truely consider it as you lyste, but it is no light matter to he cursed of God, which ruleth heauen and erth. And though the Prophete

speaketh these wordes of warriours goyng to warre, yet it may be spoken of all seruauntes, yea of all estates, but specially of seruantes. For. S.

Much lyke to our sauiors sayyng: Cibus meus est vt faciam voluntatem eius qui misit me. This is my meate, to do the will of him that sent me. I pray you seruantes marke this Eleazar well, consider all the circumstances of his diligent and faithfull seruice, and folowe it: els if you folow it not, you rede it to your owne condemnation. Likewise consider the true seruice whiche Iosephe (that godly yong man) did vnto his maister Potiphar, liefetenauntPotiphar was liefetenant of the toure in Egipt. of the towre hew faithfully he serued without any guile or fraude, therfore god promoted hym so, that he was made afterwardes the ruler ouer all Egipt.

                         we come by it? Date, geue. This is the way to get, to releue the pore. Therfore this is a false and wicked

                         to thinke that with geuyng vnto the poore we shall come to pouertie. What a geuer was Loth, that good man: cam he toLoth was a large

So (I saye) we pray for this office whiche bringeth faithe: faithe bringeth to Christ, Christ bringeth remission of sinnes, remission of synnes bringeth euerlasting life.

                         suum, mendax est, whosoeuer saith I loue god, and hateth his brother, that man or woman is a lyer. For it is impossible for me to loue god & hate my neigh bour. And our sauiour saith, Si orauetitis remittite, whā you will pray, forgeue first, els it is to no purpose, you gette nothyng by your prayer. Like wise we see in the parable of that king which called his seruauntes to make an accompte, and pay their dettes: where he remitteth one of them a great sum of money. Now that same fellow, whom the lord pardoned, wente out and toke one of his felow seruauntes by the necke, and handled him moste cruelly, sayeng: giue me my money. He had forgotten belike that his lord had forgiuen him.
                     
                     Now the other seruants, seyng his cruelnes, came vnto the kyng, and told him how that man vsed himselfe so cruelly to his felow: The lord called him again, & after great

                        , Thus will my heauenly father also do vnto you, yf ye forgeue not euery one his brother euen from your heartes. Therfore let vs take hede by that wicked seruant which woulde not forgeue his felowe seruaunt when he desyred of him forgeuenes, saying: patientiam habe in me, & omnia red 
                           〈◊〉
                        , haue pacience with me, saith he, and I will pay thee all my dettes. But we can not say so vnto god, we must onelye call for pardon.
                     There be many folke which whan they be sicke they say: O yt
                        A naughty saying. I mighte liue but one yere longer, to make amendes for my sinnes, which saying is very noughte, and vngodly. For weChrist must satisfye Only are not able to make amendes for our synnes: only Christ, he is the lambe of god which taketh away our synnes. Therfore whan we be sicke we should say: Lord god, Thy wilbe done, if I can do any thing to thy honour and glorye, Lord, suffer me to liue longer, but thy wilbe done. As for satisfaction, we can not do the leaste piece of it.
                     You haue heard nowe howe we ought to be willing to forgeue our neighbours their sinnes, which is a very token that we be children of god: to this oure sauiour also exhorteth vs, saying: Si frater

                         vnto thy brother. Leaue it there (saith our sauiour) yf thy brother haue any thing against thee: go not about to sacrifice to me, but firste aboue all thinges goe and reconcile thy self vnto thy brother. On suche wise saint Paule also exhorteth vs, saying: Volo viros orare 
                           〈◊〉
                        ; ira & disceptatione, I wold haue men to pray without angre & disceptation. There be many wranglers and braulers now a days, whiche do not well: they shall well knowe that they be not in the fauour of

                        , so that we may loue god and our neighbour. It is a very godly prayer, to say: Lord forgiue vs our trespas ses, as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs. But there be peraduenture some of you, which wil say. The priest can absolue me, and forgeue me my sinnes. Syr I tell thee, the

                           . priest or minister (cal him what you wil) he hath power giuē vnto him from our sauiour, to absolue in suche wise as he is commaunded by him: but I thinke ministers be not greatly troubled therewith: for the people seke their carnal liberties, which in dede is not wel, & a thing which misliketh god. For I would haue them that are greeued in conscience, to goe to some godly man which is able to minister gods word, & there to fetch his absolucion, if he canne not be

                         supra pecca tū yt mercy of god sar excedeth our sins. I haue heard tel of som which whā they said this petitiō, they perceiued yt they asked of god forgeuenes, like as they thēselues forgeue their neigh bors, & again perceiuing themselues so vnapt to forgiue their neighbors fautes, came to yt point, yt they would not say this praier at al: but toke our ladies psalter in hand and such foolries,Someleaue out this petition. thinking they mighte than doe vnto their neighboar a soule turne with a better conscience, than if they shoulde saye this patition: for here they wishe themselues the vengeaunce of god vpon their heades, if they beare grudge in their hearts and say this petition. But if we wil be right christians, let vs set asyde all hatered and malice, let vs liue godly and forgeue our enemy: so that we may from the bottom of our heart say. Our father which art in heauen, forgiue vs our trespasses. &c There be som when thei say, Forgeue vs our trespasses, they think yt god wil forgeue culpā only, sed nō poenā, giltines, & not yt pain: & therfore they beleue they shal go into purgatory & ther to be clensed frō their sinnes, which thing is not so: they be lyers which teach such doctrine. For god forgiueth vs both yt pain & the giltines of sinnes. Like as it appered in Da uid, whē he repēted, Nathā said vnto him: abstulit dn̄s iniqui tatē tuā, yt lord (saith he) hath takē away thy wickednes. But they wil say: god toke away the giltines of his sins, but not yt pain for he punished him afterward. Sir, yt must vnderstand, yt god punished him, but not to yt end that he shold make satisThe cause why god punisheth sepentant sinners. factiō & amēds for his sins: but for a warning god wold geue him a Caue, therefore he punished him. So likewise whosoeuer is a repentāt sinner, as Dauid was, & beleueth in Christ, he is cleane à poena & a culpa, both from the payne and giltines of his sinnes: yet god punisheth synnes, to make vs to remember and to beware of synnes.
                     Now to make an ende: you haue hearde 
                           〈◊〉
                         needeful it is for vs to crye vnto god, for forgiuenes of our sinnes: where

you haue heard wherein forgeuenes of our synnes standeth, namely in Christ the sonne of the lyuing god: Agayne I told you how you should come to Christ, namely by faith, & faithe commeth thorough hearyng the worde of god.
                     Remember then this additiō, As we forgiue them that trespas against vs: which is a sure token wherby we may know whether we haue the true faith in Christ or no. And here you learne that it is a good thyng to haue an enemy, for we maye vse him to our great commodity, thorough him or by him we may proue our selues whether we haue the true faith or no.
                     Now I shall desire you yet agayne, to praye vnto almightye god that he will sende suche water, wherby the fruites of the fielde may increase, for we thynke we haue neede of rain. Let vs therfore call vpon him, which knoweth what is beste for vs. Therfore say with me the lordes praier as he himselfe hath taught vs. Our father which. &c.

                     And though we be risen neuer so well, yet when we fall again, when we

                         leth it me to be risen once, and fall by & by into the self same sinne againe? which is a renouation of the other sinnes. For whosoeuer hath done wickedly an act against god, & afterward is sory for it, crieth god mercy, & so cōmeth to forgeuenes of the same sinne, but by & by willingly & wittingly doth the self same sin again: he renouateth by so doyng al those sinHe that

                         him and remitted him al the dets. Now that same man afterward shewed himself vnthankfull & wicked, therfore the lord called him, and caste him into prison, there to lye till he had paied the vttermost far thing, not withstanding that he had forgeuen him afore. &c.
                     So we see that the

                         of the former sinnes turne agayne, whan we do the same synnes again.

                     Here we haue a remedye, here we desyre god that he will preserue vs from falling into sinne. Our sauior (that

                         who are those whiche loue GOD, namely they that fight against temptations and assaultes of the deuill. For this life is a warfare, as S. Job saith, Militia est vita hominis super terram, The life of man is but a warfare: not that we should fyght and braule one with an other. No not so, but we shold fight against these

                        : but we shold fyght against the yll motions which rise vp in our hearts against the lawe of God. Therfore remembre that our life is a warfare, let vs be contented to be tempted. There be some whan they fall into temptations, they be so yrkesom that they geue place they wyll fight no more. Agayn, there be some so wery, that they ryd them selues out of this life, but this is not well done: they doo not after saint James mynde, for he saith: Blessed is he that suffreth temptation, and taketh it 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Now if he be blessed that suffreth tentatiō, than it foloweth, that he that curseth & murmureth against God, beyng tempted, that that man is cursed in the syght of God, and so shall not enioy coronam vitae, euerlastyng lyfe.
                     Further it is a necessary thyng to be tempted of God: for

                         how shold we know whether we haue the loue of God in our heartes or no, except we be tryed, except God tempt & proue 
                           〈◊〉
                        . Therfore the prophete Dauid sayth: Proba me DominePsal. 25. & renta me, Lorde (sayth he) proue me and tempt me. This prophete knew that to be tempted of God is a good thynge. For temptations minister to vs occasion to runne to god and to begge his helpe. Therfore Dauid was desirous to haue some thing wherby he mighte exercise his faith. For ther is nothing so dangerous in the world, as to be without trouble without temptation: for looke when we be beste at ease, whā all thinges go with vs according vnto our will and pleasure, then we ar commenlye most farthest of from God. For oure nature is so feble that we can not beare tranquilitie, we forgette

god by and by: therfore we should say, proba me, Lord proue and tempt me.
                     I haue red ones a storie of a good bishop, which rode by theAn history of a bishop waye, and was werie, being yet far of frō any toun: therfore seyng a faire house, a great mans house, he went thither and was verie well and honorably receiued: there was great preparations made for him, and a great banket, all thinge was plentie. Then the man of the house, set out his prosperitie, and told the bishop what richesse he had, in what honour and dignities he was, how many faire children he had, what a vertuouse wife god had prouided for hym, so that he hadde no lacke of any maner of thing, he had no trouble nor verations, neither inward nor outward. Now this holy man hering the good estate of that man, called one of his seruantes, and commanded him to make ready the horses: for the bishop thought that God was not in that house, because there was no tempta tion there: he toke his leaue and went his 
                           〈◊〉

                         yt this is the way to make our enemy good, to bryng hym to reformation. But there be some, that when they bee hurte, they wyll doe a foule turne agayne: but this is not as GOD woulde haue it. Sainct Paule commaundeth vs to poure hoate coales vppon our enemies heade: that is to saye, yf he hurte thee, doe hym good, make him amends with weldoyng, geue him meate and drynke, whereby is vnderstande all thynges: when he hathe neede of councell, helpe hym, or whatsoeuer it is, that he hathe neede of, lette hym haue it. And thys is the righte way to reforme our enemie, to amend hym, and bryng hym to goodnesse. For so Saincte Paule commaūdeth vs, saying: Noli vinci à malo, be not ouercomeHe that

                     When I was in Cambridge, Maister George Stafforde

red a lecture, there I heard him: and in expounding the

                         to the Romains, comming to that place, where S. PauleRom.

Now in expounding of that place, he brought in an ensample: saying, that he knewe in London a great riche merchaunte, whiche merchant had aAn history of a Londo ner. very poore neighbour, yet for all his pouertye, he loued hym very well, and lente him money at his neede, and lette him to come to his table whansoeuer he would. It was euen at that time, when Doctour

                         man, he beganne to smell the gospell, the poore man was a papiste still. It 
                           〈◊〉
                         on a tyme, when the riche manne talked of the gospell sittyng at hys table, where he reproued popery, and suche kynde of thinges: the poore man beyng then presente, toke a greate displeasure againste the richeman: in so muche, that he woulde come no

                         to his house, he woulde borow no money of him, as he was wonte to do before tymes: yea and conceiued suche hatered and malice against him, that he went and accused hym before the bishops.The zeale of a papist. Now the rych man, not knowyng any such displesure, offred many times to talke with him: & to set him at

                         out of his waye. One tyme it happened that he mette him so in a narrowe streete, that he coulde not auoyde, but come

                         him: yet for all that thys poore

                         had suche a stomacke againste the ryche man I saye, that he was mynded to goe forwarde, and not to speake wyth hym. The ryche man perceiuyng that, catcheth hym by the hande, and asked hym faying: Neighbour, what is come into your hearte, to take suche displeasure wyth me? what haue I done agaynste you? tell me, and I will bee redye at all tymes to make you amendes. Final ye, he spake so gentelye, so charitablye, so louynglye, and friendlye, that it wroughte so in the poore mannes hearte, that by and by he fell downe vppon hys knees:

and asked hym forgeuenes: the ryche man forgaue him, and so toke him agayn to his fauour, & they loued as well as euer they did afore. Many one would haue said, set him in the

                     DERELY beloued in the Lord, the gospell that is redde this day is a parable, a similitude, or comparison. For our sauiour compared the kyngdom of GOD vnto a man, that made a mariage for his sonne. And here was a mariage. At a mariage you knowe there is commonly great feastynges. Nowe you must know who was this feast maker, and who was his sonne, and to whom he was maried, and who were these that should be called, and who were the callers, 
                           〈◊〉
                         they behaued them selues, and how the gestes behaued them selues towardes them that called them.
                     Now this mariage maker, or feast maker, is almighty god.VVho vvas this mariage maker. Luke the Euangelist calleth him a man, saying: A certayne man ordeined a great supper: He called him a mā, not that he was

                         vpon him, no not so, for you must vnderstand that there be thre persons in the 
                           〈◊〉
                        , God the father, god the sonne, and god the holy ghost. And these three personnes 
                           〈◊〉
                         the sonne with manhode: so that neither the father, neither the holy ghost, toke flesh vpō them, but onely the sonne: he tooke

                         flesh vpon him, taking

                         vpon him, but onely compared

                         was he maried? Mary to his churche and congregation: for heChrist is the bridegroome. The church is the

                         vnto him, and to be maried vnto him: but we see by dayly experience, that the moste

                            man may go to the law but how? As it is laufull for me beyng sick to go to the phisicion without breach of my fayth to godward: but yf I should go to the phisition in

merite somwhat by our owne woorkes: for reward and merite are correspondent, one foloweth the other: whan I haue merited, than I ought to haue my reward. But we shall not thynke so: for ye must vnderstande, that all our workes are imperfect: we can not doo them so perfectely as the lawe requireth, because of our fleshe which euer letteth vs. Wherfore is the kyngdome of god called than a rewarde? because it is merited by Christ: for as touchyng our saluation and eternallChrist hath merited for vs. lyfe, it must be merited, but not by our owne workes, but onely by the merites of our

For it is written, Vita aeterna donum Dei, The euerlasting lyfe is a gift of god. Therfore we shuld not esteme our workes so perfect as though we should or coulde merite heauen by them: yet god hath such pleasures in suche workes which we doo with a faithfull heart: that he promiseth to rewarde thē in euerlasting lyfe. Now to make an end, I desire you in gods behalfe, remēbre this pilgremage which I haue taught you, set not lyght by it: for it is our sauiors owne doctrine, he with his owne mouth taught vs this pilgremage: whan we will now folowe hym, and doo accordyng as he teacheth vs, than all these blessyngs, of which mencion is made, shal lyght vpon vs: and in the ende we shall obteyne euerlasting life. which graunt both you and me, God the father through his onely sonne our sauior Iesus Christe.

Now you must consider what maner an enemy he is that fighteth against vs: and first consider his power: scripture saith Non est potestas, there is no power in earth, whicheIob. 41. may be compared vnto hys power.

This diuell was ones an angell in heauen, & for pride he was cast down: for he went about to exalt hymDiuelles vvere Angels. selfe aboue GOD, therfore he was pulled downe, and all his companie with hym, al the angels that toke his part, and so he fell with a great numbre: they fell down from heauen, and here they be in the ayre: yet they be inuisible vnto vs, because they be spirites: but for all that they bee amongest vs, and aboute vs, to let vs of good thynges, and to moue vs to naughtynesse: I am not able to tell howe many thousand be here amongest vs now in this chambre: and no doubte some were busy to keepe some men away from the hearyng of the woord of God: for their nature is eyther to kepe men away from hearyng of Gods word, so that they shall not heare atNote what the deuils nature is. all: or els at the least waye, they occupie mens heades with other busynes: so that they shall here it without profit.

Not to get a fat benefice or a bishoprike. No no, saint Paule was not a hunter of benefices: He saith, praye that I may haue vtterance and boldnes to speake. And this was requisite to his office: for though a preacher be wel learned, but yet lacketh that boldenes, is faint hearted, truely he shall doe but litle good for all his learning: when he feareth men more then god, he is nothyng to be regarded. Therfore this is the thyng that S. Paule so muche desireth, to haue boldenes to speake: for when a prechers mouth is stopped so that he dareA faint

Now like as saint Paule required the Ephesi ans to pray for him that he may haue vtterance, for this was most necessary for his office: So let euery one pray vnto god & desyre other to pray for hym, that he may doe the workes of hys vocation. As for an ensaumple when he is a maryed man, lette hym praye vnto God that he maye loue his wife, cherishe her, honour her, and beare with her insirmities.All estates haue

of God, therfore they haue the more nede of the help of god: yea let euery good subiect praye vnto God for the magistrates, that they may doo their dueties accordyng vnto goddes will and cōmandement. And no doute thys is a good prayer, whan one faithfull man prayeth for thother: such prayer shal not be in vaine, God will heare it, and graunte suche faithfullPrayer is no

For it is as necessarie for me whan I am in tribulation to call vppon God, and I ought to doo it as well vnder the payne of damnation, as well as I am bound to kepe any of his commandementes. By the vertue of this commaundemente, Thou shalt not steale, I may not take awai other mens goods. So by this commandement, Thou shalt not cōmyt adulterie, I may not defile an other mans wife. So by the vertu of this commandement, lnuoca me in die tribulationis, Call vpon me in the tyme of trouble, I oughte and am bounde vnderIt is damnable not to pray vato God in trouble. the paine of damnation to resort vnto god, to call vpon him, to seke aide and helpe by him, at his hands.

For it brought to passe that whan god would destroye the Israelites, he coulde not because of Moses prayers: Moses letted god of his purpose. And no dout god loueth to be letted: for god loueth not to punishe or destroy the people, and therfore by a prophete God complained that there was founde not a

                     The Pharisees and Scribes asked Christ our sauior whether they should geue tribute vnto Cesar or not: for it irked them that they should pay tribute, they thoughte it to bee a great seruitude: but they asked Christ this question of a mis cheuous mynde, intendyng to take him in his words: but he disapointed thē pretily, asking whose ymage the money bareThe

They spake nothing of god, but onely of the tribute, but our Sauiour in his answer telleth them and all the world their dueties: yet he doth it with darke and couered wordes: they confessed that the ymage was the emperors, and so consequently subiects vnto him: then our sauiour commaunded them to pay according vnto the order, as themperor had agreed with thē, thatThis

And so the same false Prophetes didde muche harme: for a great number of people did credite them, and folowed theyr doctryne: which thinges greeued saint Paule very sore: ther fore he admonished them, as who say, ye haue preachers amongest you: I would not haue you to folowe them: folowe rather me, and them that walke lyke as I do. This was not arrogantly spoken, but rather louingly, to kepe them from error. he saith the same to the

Now ye may make such an argumēt, Phenees did so, and pleased god in his doynges, ergo we may doo so too: when we see any man dishonor god, we may goe and kyll hym by and by.

but suche thinges greue not vs: though god be dishonoured we care not for it: but when we haue losse of oure goods, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         certain domages, then we can wepe from the

                         of our heartes, and be most sorowful: but when we heare that god is dishonoured, that lechery is committed, or other horrible sinnes done, that greeueth vs not, then we weepe not:Vve vvepe not as S. Paul did. & so it appeareth most manifestly that we haue not the hearte of S. Paule, we are not so mynded.
                     Now peraduenture some body might say that S. Paule had standred these men in writyng so sharply against them, and in callyng them the enemies of the crosse of Christe: but2. Tim. 2 it is not so, he slaundereth them not. In the Epistle to Timo the he named some by their names Philetum, and Hyneneū. You must consider that Saint Paule did well in reprouyng them openlye: for a man maye sometimes tell an other mans faultes: for not euery tellyng is slaunderyng. When a man telleth an other mans faultes with a good mynde, and to a good purpose, this tellyng is wel: but that is nought and very slaundering when I reherse before other men the faults ofVVhat sla undering is. my neighbour with a malicious stomacke: I hate him, & ther fore I make him to be knowen, I paynte him oute in hys colours, and sometymes I say more by him then I am able to proue, this is slaunderyng: but when a man telleth an other mans faultes with a good mynde to his reformation, that is not standeryng. As we rede a story of S. Bernhard, whether it be true other not, it is no matter, take it for an ensaumple, and learne thereby what is 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and what is not. Saint Berneharde was a goodly vprighte younge man and well fauoured, he came at a tyme with his company to an ynne, where he taried all nighte. And because he was a faire man,A fable of S. Bernhard and his hostes the woman in the house caste her eyes vppon hym: desiring in her heart to haue carnal company with him, and therfore after supper she apointed a chamber for: him alone, to that end that she might come vnto him afterwarde, and so she diddet for whan euerye bodye was at reste she came vnto hys bedde intendynge to lye wyth hym: Saincte Berneharde perceyuynge that, cryed out with a loude voyce, Fures, Fures, theues, theues: hys fellowes hearyng hym

hym, askyng what the matter was: he tolde them that there was a theefe there: nowe they thoughte he hadde dreamed, wente to bedde agayne: As soone as they were gone, by and by the woman came agayne, then he cryed againe. So in the mornyng saincte Berneharde woulde not tarye long in that house, and as they were in the way, he tolde to his fellowes how that the woman hadde come vnto him, desyring them to take hede an other tyme of that womā, for she was a naughty woman, she would haue stolen from him the holy ghoste, the remission of his sinnes, and all goodnes: for if he shoulde haue folowed her, she shoulde haue robbed him of all these thynges: of such a fashion we may tel other mens faultes.
                     For 
                           〈◊〉
                         Berneharde tolde it to that ende to gene the warnyng to take hede of yt womā. Now this was not slandering and so likewise S. Paule here slaundereth them not, but set them out in their colours, to admonish vs to beware of them and so we ought to do, when we know a man that is wicked and wil not leaue his wickednes after due admonitious: No doute it is a good thyng to geue vnto other men warnyng of such a man, that they maye take heede of him: As for an ensample.Theues sworue to be true. There be a company of theeues sworne together to be true one to theother, and not to disclose one another. Now I am amongest them: and after some mischiefe done I am taken and condemned by the law to be hanged. Shall I not disclose now my company and geue vnto the magistrates warnyng of them? yes I would thinke that man that is in suche a case, doth well to disclose his company, for it pertaineth to a good ende, and is a charitable deede, els his company may doe muche harme afore they be knowen. No doute that manA good wishe. shoulde doe well, and I thynke he oughte to doe it. And I woulde GOD that all theeues in Englande were so persuaded in theyr heartes, that when one were taken that he should disclose his felowes too: No doute we should haue better reste, theeues would not so much trouble the common welthe as they do.
                     Weepynge. It greeued Saincte Paule verye sore that Christian soules should so bee seduced thorough false religion,

I woulde wyshe that there were suche a feruente zeale now in vs, as was in hym then: but it is not so, we haue no care for the soules of Christian people. And that appeareth moste manyfestly by those vnpreachyng prelates. For yf they hadde suche an earnest mynde to the

A man may be an enemy of the crosse of Christe two manner of wayes. All the papistes in Englande and speciallye the spirituall men, be the enemyes of the crosse of Christe two maner of wayes. Fyrste when he is a ryghte papiste geuen to monkerye, I warraunt you he is in this opinion, that wyth hys owne workes he doth merite remission of hys synnes, and satisfieth the law thorough and by his owne workes, and so thinketh himselfe to bee saued euerlastynglye. This is the opinion of all papystes. And thys doctryne was taughte in tymes paste in scholes and in the pulpettes. Nowe all these that be in suche an opinion, they be the enemies of the crosse of Christe, of his passion and bloudshedyng: for they thynke in themselues Christe needeth not to dye, and so they despyse his bitter passion: they doe not consider oure byrth, synne, and the corruption of our nature nor yet doe they knowe the quantitys of our actuall synnes, howe many tymes we fall in synnes, or howe muche oure owne power is diminished, nor what power & might the deuyll hath: they consider not suche thynges, but thynke themselues able with theyr owne workes to enter into the kyngdome of God. And therfore I tell you, this is the peryllous doctryne that canne be deuysed. For all faythefull and true Christians beleue onelye in hys deathe, they long to bee saued thoroughe his passion, and bloudeshedyng: thys is all theyr comforte: they knowe and most stedfastly beleue, that Christ fulfylled the lawe. And that his fulfyllynge is 
                           〈◊〉
                        , so that they attribute vnto Christ the gettyng & meriting of euerlasting lyfe. And so it foloweth that thei which attribute

the remission of synnes, the getting of euerlasting life, vnto thēselues or their works, they denie Christ, they blaspheme and

For Christ shed as much blood for Iudas as he dyd for Peter. Peter beleued it, and therfore he was saued.

But to say or to beleue that we should be saued by the law, this is a great dishonoring of Christes passion: for the lawe serued to an other purpose, it bringeth vs to the knowlege of our sinnes, and so to Christ: for whan we be come through the law to the knowlege of our syns, when we perceiue our filthines then we be redy to come to Christ and fetch remission of our synnes at hys handes. But the Papistes fetch the remission of their synnes, not in the passion of Christ, but in their own doings: they thinke to come to heauen by their own works, which is naught. We must do good workes, we must endeuour our selues to lyue accordyng to the commandementes of God: yet for all that we must not trust in our doynges. For though we doo the vttermost, yet is it al vnperfect, whā ye examine them by the rigor of the law, which law seruethVVe must work but not trust in our workes. to bryng vs to the knowlege of our sinnes, and so to Christ, and by Christ we shall com to the quietnes of our conscience. But to trust in our good workes, is nothing but a robbing of Christ, of his glorie and maiestie. Therfore it is not more necessarie to doo good workes, than it is to beware howe to esteme them. Therfore take heede good christen people, deny not Christe, put not your hope in youre dooynges: for

So lykewise God himselfe geneth vs warnyngeEzech. 3 in the 3.

And because this fryar hadde preached thys sermon so often: one that hearde it before told the friars seruaunte that his maister was called, friar Iohn ten commaundement: wherfore the seruaunte shewed the fryar hys maister thereof, and aduysed him to preach of some other maters: for it greeued the seruaunte to here his maister deryded.

Therfore I saye bee not offended with me, whenne I tell you one thynge twoo or three tymes. And specially marke thys well, that the parisheners are not excused before GOD by the wickednesse and blyndenesse of the prieste. For GOD sayeth not, I wyll require the bloude of the people at the curates hande, and the people shalbee withoute blame: No not so, but the wycked shall perishe beecause of

his wickednes, so that the blynde people and the blynde curate shall go to hell together. I would wishe that all England were persuaded so: for the moste part of the people thinkA good vvish for England. themselues to be excused by their curates. But it is not so: for yf there bee any man wicked because his curate teacheth hym not, his bloud shalbe required at the curates hands: yet for all that the parishner shall goe to the diuell withall: that shal be his end. Therfore beware of that opinion, thinke not to be excused by your curate. for when ye do, ye do not well: and so you shall repente in the ende. S.

Chap. of Daniell, how that Nabuchadonozcr,Danie. 3. the king caused a golden image to be made: And so called all his lordes and his people to come and worship his Idole which he had set vp, threatning further that whosoeuer wold not fall doune and worship the said ydole, should be caste in a hote ouen. Now there were three young men, Sydrach, Mesach, and Abdenago, which refused to worship the said ydole, saienge, O Nabuchadonozer, we ought not to consente vnto thee in this matter for why? our god whom we serue is able to kepe vs from the hote burnyng ouen, and can righte well delyuer vs oute of thy handes: and thoughe he will not, yet shalte thou know that we will not serue thy gods, nor doe any reuerēce to that ymage which thou hast set vp. Then was Nabuchadonozer exceding full of indignation against them, and commaunded by and by that the ouen should be made se uen tymes hoter than it was wonte to bee, and spake vnto the strongest men that were in his hoste, to bynde Sydrach, Mesach, and Abdenago, and cast them in the burnyng ouen. So these menne were bounde in theire coates, hosen, shoes, wt theirother garments, and cast in to an hote burning ouen, for the kinges commaundement was so strayght, and the ouen was exceding hote, and these three men Sydrach, Mesach, and Abdenago fell doune in the hote burning ouen, beyng fast bound. Then Nabuchadonozer the king merueyled and stode vp in all hast and spake vnto his councell, saying, did ye not cast these three men into the fyer? they answered, 
                           〈◊〉
                        : yea O king: he answered and sayd, lo for al that, I doGod suf frednot he fyre to do his nature see fowre men goyng lose in the myddest of the fyre, and nothyng corrupte, and the fourth is like the sonne of GOD to looke

                     Here in this storie you se that though the nature of the fire is to consume, yet these three men were not consumed wyth the same. for not a heare of their heade perished, but rather the fyre brake oute and consunied them that put them in the ouen: so the fyre of his nature woulde haue consumed them, yet thorow the power of god the strength of the fyre was

At the tyme when Achab that wycked kyng and his wife Iezabel, more wickeder then her husbande, when they had the rule, they abolished the worde of god cleane, and set vp false doctryne, killed the true prophets of god: in so much that Elias saith vnto god with cryeng and great lamentations, sayeng: Lord the children of Israel haue forsaken thy couenaunte, broken doune thyne altars, and

Here it appereth, that the pulpets at that tyme were occupied with false teachers, with false religion, lyke as it was in the tyme of our forefathers: in so much that Elias crieth out and faith plainly, that there were left no more but he oncly. But what saith god? IGod had hys num ber in Eli as tyme. haue lefte me seuen thousande which haue not bowed their knees vnto Baal: when Elias, thought that there was lefte more but he only, then god shewed hym a great many which were left, and not infected with the poyson of the false doctryne. Therfore lyke as god could preserue a greate number of the Israelites at the same tyme, so he could preserue oure forefathers from the poyson of poperye which was taught at that tyme: for the Lorde knoweth whyche arc hys. Item, Christe hymselfe sayeth, Quos mihi dedit Pater, No manIohn. 6. shall take these from me whiche my father hath geuen vnto me, that is to say which are ordeyned to euerlasting lyfe.

ThisAn aunsvver to the same is a folishe reason: I will aunswere you this. I wyll make you thys argument: God can and is able to preserue thyngs from fyre, so that they shal not burne or consume: and therfore I wyll go & set my house a fyre, and it shalbee preserued.

                     This much I thought good to say against the suggestion of the deuill, when he putteth thee in mynd saying: (thy fore fathers are damned) that thou mightest learn not to dispeire of theyr saluation: and yet not be to carefull, for they haue theyr parte: we must not make an accompt for their doings: euery one must make answer for himselfe. for when they be damned they can not be brought agayne with our sorowfulnes: let vs rather indeuour our selues to heare gods worde diligently, and learne the way of saluation, so that when we shalbe called, we may be sureof it.
                     Now these false preachers of which saint Paule speakethOur care fulnes can not bring oure fa thers oute of hell. here, are enemies vnto the crosse of Christ. what shalbe their ende? Mary perdition, destruction, and euerlastyng damnati on, Whose god is their belly. The false preachers preache onely pleasaunt thinges, and so get great rewardes, and are able to liue wealthely in this world & to make good chere. IThe ende of the fals preachers Preachers vvill go

                           . fear me there be many of these belly goods in yt world, which preache pleasaunt thinges to get ryches, to go gay and trick vp themselues: they care for no more, they study and do what they can to buckle the gospel & the world together, to set god and the deuyl at one table, they be gospellers no longer but till they get riches: when they haue that that they seeke for, they care for no more: than the gospell is gone quite out of theyr hartes, and theyr glorye is to theyr shame: it is a short glorye and a longe shame, that they shall haue: for in the other worlde, Erunt ad satietatem visionis omni carni, all the worlde shall laughe vpon them to their shame, whiche are worldlye mynded. Is there not more that be worldly mynded then that bee godlye mynded? I thinke S. Paule spake these wordes by the cleargie men, that wil take vppon them the spirituall office of preaching, and yet meddle in worldlyA note for our cleargy. matters to, contrarye to theyr callinge: The cleargye of our tyme hathe procured vnto themselues a libertie to purchase landes. thinke ye not that such doinges sauered somwhat of worldlye thynges? But I will desyer them to take hede. for

S. Paule saith here, that all they that be worldlye mynded, ar enemies of the crosse of Christ: for they make theyr bellies to be theyr gods. Therfore they shall receiue their punyshmentThe revvard of such preachers. for theyr wicked doings. what shal that be? marie euer lasting paine of hellishe fire world without ende, without any deliuerance from the same, this is their rewarde.
                     But what shall become of Saint Paule and all true preachers? he saith: But our conuersation is in heauen. What was Saincte Paule in heauen whan he spake these woordes?The revvard of true preachers. No, he was here on earthe: but whan we walke the pilgremage of whiche I told you the last day, Gods pilgremage: than our conuersation is in heauen, that is conformable vnto gods heauenly wil: and god seeth them and wil reward them. whan we will do the workes of our vocation, & wrastle with synne and wickednes, and liue after gods willVVhat it is to haue our conuersation in heauen and pleasure: who soeuer doth so, that man or woman hath his conuersation in heauen. From whence we long for the sauior, euen the lord Jesus Christ. S. Paule looked for hym to come from heauen. what is he not here all ready? Christ is here with vs alredy to our comfort, by his spirite and power to be our helper, and to worke with his sacramentes, to defend vs from danger and perill, so he is with vs in earth: but he is not here bodily. For he ascended into heauen, and sittethChrist is not here bodely. at the right hand of god the almightie: from thens shall he come to iudge the quick and the dead: all good men & women long for hym. And no doubte he will come, and verye shortely: and wyll take accompt of euery one of vs: therfore as all the writers monyshe vs: lette vs neuer forget this day which we call the domes day. Sainct Hierome saythe, that he euer thoughte he hearde the trompette. Nowe they that haue in consideration this day, and make themselues ready: it is a ioyfull thyng vnto theym: but they that be customable synners, wyll not leaue their wickednesse, suche as bre swearers, or adulterers, or idolaters, and doo credite poperie:The day of dome shal beterrible to

                           . vnto theym this daye shall bee a fearefull daye: it shall bee a heauy commyng vnto theym. Saincte Paule telleth what good chere they shall haue, namely euerlastyng damnation, beyng the ennemie of Christe, theyr glorye shall

turne to their eternall shame. So you see that all the worlde may be deuided in two partes: namely into the faithfull and vnfaithfull. Now S. Paule saithe, that he looketh for this Sauiour, which shall chaunge our

                     Now to make an ende, for Gods sake marke these lessons well: for this is a very good pece of scripture, wherin Paul sheweth both wayes: I thinke it were better for vs to lyue so, that we may attaine to this felicitie, which is prepared for vs in heauen, rather than to folow our carnal desires and lustes. For whan we leaue our wicked life, & credite the word of god, and haue a delite in it: No dout it shall bryng vs in the end to this saluation, of which saint Paul speaketh here.

For though yt Iewes had a law, that they should make no sacrifices no where but at Ierusalem, where the temple was & al the ceremonies: yet for all yt they had in euery towne their churches or synagoges: like as we haue churches here in England, cōmonly euery towne hath a church. And this word Church, somtimes it signifieth the congregation: the people that is gathered together: somtymes it signifieth the place where the people come together,The thing that conteineth for that vvhiche is con te yned. continens pro contento.

And no doubt he had a good substanciall faithe, as it appered by his behauiors: yet he had not so good a faithe as the CenturionCenturiō had a grea ter faith then Iairus. had, which sent a message vnto hym, saying: Lord, say but one word, and my seruant shal be whole.

But though this Iairus had not so good a faith as the CenturionMath. 8. had: yet he hath had suche one which leadeth hym to Christ. He commeth to Christe, he beleeueth that Christ is able to helpe hym, and accordyng vnto his belefe, it happeneth vnto hym. For his doughter was healed, as ye shall heare afterwarde: And so vppon hym is fulfylled the Scripture. Credide

For looke what manne so euerIairus had a good faith. hath a good faythe, he wyll not holde his peace, he wil speake, he wyll calle for healpe at his handes: For yf this Iairus hadde not hadde a good faythe: he woulde not haue humbled hymselfe so muche, to falle downe before

such a poore man as our sauiour was. Some wold haue had respect to their honors: They would haue thought it skorne to fall doune before such a poore man as our sauiour was: or els he would haue bene afraide of the people that were present, to honor him so highly, and to confesse hym to be a helper. And no doubt, that Iairus was in greate danger of his

                        : for Christ was not beloued amongest the Iowes, therfore it was a great matter for this Iairus to honor Christ so openly before all the multitude. And no doubt if he had not 
                           〈◊〉
                         so good, strong, and earnest faith, he wold not haue done as he did, but he had a good strong faithe: therfore he was not afraide of any thing in the worlde.
                     Now ye shall learne of this Iairus, first by his ensample to go to Christ, in all distresses to seke helpe by hym: And alsoIairus isto be folow ed in two thynges. ye shall marke and obserue his greate and fatherlye loue, that he hath towardes his daughter: for he maketh greate sute to Christ for her, whiche signifieth that he hath a greate and earnest loue towardes her. The same fatherly affection and loue of the parentes towards their children, is the good gift of God: And god hath planted the same in their hertes: And this specially, for two respectes. Fyrst, for the childrens sake: for it is an irkesome thyng to bryng vp children: and not only that, but also it is a chargeable thing to kepe them, and to waite vpon them: and preserue them from all perill: if god had not planted such loue in the parentes heartes, in

                         it were impossible to doo so muche for theim: but God hath planted suche loue in their heartes, whiche loue takethThe commoditie of naturall affection. away all irksomnes of all labour and payne. for what is a chylde whan it is left alone? what can it do? How is it able to lyue? An other cause is, wherfore god hath planted such loue in the parentes hearts towards their children: that we might lerne by it, what affections he beareth towards vs. for though the loue of parentes towardes their children bee very great: yet the loue of god towards vs is greater: yea his loueVVe are the

for our sake hath bestowed his onely natural sonne, vnto the death, to the ende that we should be made thorough him, his chosen children. Now therfore all that

                         in Christ, and trust thorow his passion to be saued: all they are the childrē of god: And god loueth them more than any naturall father loueth his childe. For the loue of God

                        . As for oure carnall or temporall fathers and mothers, sometymes they be vnnaturall, so that they will not healpe their children in their distresse: sometimes agayne they wold fayne helpe, but they ar not able to helpe them. But our heuenly Father, he is louyng and kynde towurdes vs, so that he will helpe. And then agayn he is mightie, he is almighty, he can and may helpe: so that there lacketh neither good will in hym, neither power. Therfore let vs not dispeyre, but rather come vnto hym in all tribulation, and no doubt we shal be eased by him. For certaine it is, that the almyghtye God hath greater affection towards vs, than our naturall fathers and mothers can haue. And this appeareth by that that he hath geuen his natural sonne (the highest treasure that euer he had in

It is a rare thyng whan the deuill so muche preuatleth in parentes, that a mother shold neglect or forget her own child: yet saith God, though it were so that she woulde forget her child, yet wil not I forget thee, whā thou beleuest in my

                         than he is. Further his loue which he be a reth towards vs, is expressed in yt. 7. cap. of Mat. wher Christ saith: Is there any man amongst you, which if his sonne ask bread, wil he offer him a stone? or if he asketh

                     Now to the matter: This Iairus is a good and louyng father towards his child: be cometh & desireth help of Christ: yt his daughter may be heled: A conetous mā wold haue passed on, he wold not haue takē so much pain as to com to Christ & desire his help. Therfore by this

                         we may lern to haue a good faith towards god, & a right natural loue towards our children. But it is a cōfortable thing to consider this fatherly affection of god towardes va: if we wold wel cōsider yt same,The consideration of gods

                           〈◊〉
                        ? Answere. The general will of God is expressed in the

                         commaundementes: there we shall fynde what we shall doe and what we shall leaue vndone. But there is a speciall wyll of god, whiche is euery mans callyng: for it is the will & pleasure of god yt euery one shall do accordyng vnto his cal ling, wherunto god hath appointed hym: as the magistratesThe speci all vvill of god. theyr callyng is to

                         that all thynges be well, that Iustice be

                        , that the wycked be punished, and the good be re warded. Item, that the good and godlye lawes be mayntayned and executed: and most specially that the word of god be taught, that the people be not ignoruant in that: and thys is the will of god: when the magistrates do so when they endeuor themselues that gods honor and glory be set abroade, and wyckednes bee abolished, then they do accordyng vnto theyr callyng. So likewise the callyng of the subiectes is to bee obediente vnto the magistrates: not to rebell agaynste them: for when they do, they striue against GOD himselfe, and shalbee punished of him. Item the maried man oughte to doe his duetye towardes his wyfe, that is the wyll of GOD, to loue his wyfe, to prouyde for her &c. Lykewise the woman 
                           〈◊〉
                         to doe her duetye towardes her husbande in obeying hym in all thynges that be not against god. For she may not obey her

                         in wicked thin ges, which be against god: but els there is no exception, but obey she must. For so it is writē, so saith god vnto her: In sorow shalte thou bring 
                           〈◊〉
                         thy children, and thy

                         shall pertayne vnto thy husband, and he shall haue the rule of theGene. 3. Now when the woman doth so, then she doth accordyng vnto her callyng.
                     Further, maisters ought to do theyr dueties towards their seruauntes, and householde: to instruct them in gods word: to let them haue theyr meate and drynke. Lykewise, seruantes oughte to obey theyr maisters, with al hūblenes, to serue them vprightlye, and diligentlye: accordyng as god willeth them to do. Now this is the special wyll of god, namely that euery oneshal do accordyng vnto his callyng, as god willeth him to do. Now to fulfyll thys wyll of god, we should be mouedGods fatherly

                     Here I must take occasion to speake somewhat: there beeOuer hasty buriēg of men scarse dead, many, now a dais, very hasty to bury their frendes: yea somtymes before they be well dead. I heard say

                        , that a yong woman was sicke, and fell in a sounde: her frendes whyche were with her, by and by made her redye to be buried: and when they went with the corse, and were commyng into the church yarde, the corse stirred: and the vicar commaunded thē yt bare her, to set her doune, and so finally the womā recouered.

                         had ben so hasty with him, he should haue ben buried before that tyme. Therfore I admonish you, be not to hasty with deade corses: as long as they bee warme, kepe them in the bed: for when a man is dead in dede, he wyll soone be cold.
                     When our sauiour was goyng amongest this great multitude to Iairus house: there commeth a woman thorough the people, desirous to touche his garment. The EuangelistMark. 5. Marke setteth out this story more plainly, thē Mathew doth, he

This place of scripture reproueth not phisicions, as though phisike were a superstuous thyng, and not necessary because this woman was not healed: As when ye woulde reason of this maner: What? shall I go to phisike? No that I wyll not: for I reade in scripture, that a woman spente all her good vpon phisitions, and yet was neuer the better. But thys texte maketh no more agaynste phisike, then thys texte doth agaynst labour, where Peter saith: Per totam noctem laborauimus, & nihil coepimus, we haue laboured the whole night, and haue gotten nothyng.

Now although God sendeth Esay thither to tell him that he shall dye, yet it was not such a straight sentence, that it should be done out of hād, by and by: but rather god would moue hym by this message that Esay brought, to make sute for longer lyfe.

So ye see by the ensaple of Hezekia, that it is laufull to vse phisike. But now at oure tyme, phisike is a remedy prepared only for riche folkes, not for poore: for the poore man is not able to wage the phisicion. GOD in dede hathe made phisike, for ryche and poore: but phisitions now a dayes seeke onelye theyr owne profites, howe to gette money, not how they myght doe good vnto theyr poore neyghbour.

                           〈◊〉
                         to doe good, we shall do it. And here we learne an other thyng in our sauiour, namely that there is no respect of

persons with him, he regardeth not the outwarde shewe of men whether they bee poore or ryche, but as Saincte Peter sayth, In all people, he that feareth God and worketh rightuousnes, be is accepted vnto him. For 
                           〈◊〉
                         refused no mā neither rich nor poore. But we see they that be poore ar commonly yll handled in this worlde, no man regardeth them, euery man despiseth them. Againe we rede euery where that the ryche and greate men are yll spoken of in Scripture, potentesThe riche menne are euill spoken of in the

                         patientur thy mightye men shall mightily suffer paynes in hell: yet this scripture disalo weth or reproucth not great men and mightye rulers, but it speaketh against those which abuse their power where wyth god hathe endued them, oppresse other poore men, do thē wrong and miuries. For commonly it is sene, that they that be rich are loftye and stoute, and abuse their riches or theyr power:Christe hath no re spect to the persōs for no doute riches may be vsed to good purposes. But oure sauiour he hath no respecte to persons, whether 
                           〈◊〉
                         be poore or riche: for here we see how he helpeth syrst the poore womā and now is goyng to helpe the richeman too, to rayse vp his daughter which was dead and redy to be buryed. Further we learne here by this Jairus to be constannt and stedfast in our faith, not to be moued wt 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         wind: for there was many thinges which might haue moued this Jairus to mistrust our sauiour, and to tunne from him. First bys seruant that came and told hym, thy daughter is gone, which was a greatNo thinge should dis courage vs. discomfort: for as long as she was yet alyue he hadde a good hope, but when he hearde that she was gone, it discouraged hym very sore. Secondarily the preparatiō which was made for her to bee buried, for all the people were come now to go with the corse which was a great discomfort vnto hym also. Thirdlye the wordes of our sautour most aboue all thynges discomforted hym, when our sauiour saith, she is not deade but she sleepeth: by these wordes Jairus might haue conceined an yll opinion in hym, saying: What: be thynketh that she slepeth: no if it were so, I could rayse her vp my self. Of such wyse this Jairus was tempted. Now when they came nere vnto the house, there was a greate number of people which laughed oure sauiour to scorne, when he sayd that she

slept: where we may lern to be contēt, though we be despised and not set by in this world: seyng that our sauiour himselfe was of such wyse despised. I doute not but I haue ben laugh cd to scorne when I haue preached, that the way to gette riches is, to geue away to the poore this that we haue. They haue called me olde dotyng foole: but what then, we must be content to be despised with Christe here in this worlde, that we may be glorifyed with him in yonder worlde.
                     Here is made mention of 
                           〈◊〉
                        , no dout they haue theirThe vse of minstrels and belles good vse to make folke mery, and to driue away phantasies, at that tyme they vsed minstrels to their burials, as we vse here bels. Now our sauiour seeing the people that was come to go with the corse, and the pypers and minstrels redy, he conforted Jairum, which no dout was in great anguish: ther fore Christ saith vnto him: Noli timere, tantum crede, fcare not, but onely beeleue: continue onely in thy faith towardes me, and all thinges shalbe well. Now lyke as he saith to Jairus, so he saith to vs too, in what peryl or tribulation soeuer we be, we should not saynte, we shuld not feare, but beleue, he wyll regarde our faith as muche as he regarded the fayth of Jairus. And we shall attayne to such an ende as he did: for ye must consider that the almighty god doth sometymes put of the fulfilling of his promises, and helpeth not by and by:The cause vvhy god graunteth not our

Therfore let vs continue in prayer, and in faith, and no doute he will helpe when it is the verye tymc. Expecta dominum sayth Dauid, tary for the Lorde,

                     Now when our sauiour was come to the house, he suffred no man to go in with hym, but Peter James and John, and the father and mother of the chyld: al the other he thrust out, and toke the mayde by the hande, saying tabita cumi, that is to say,

Now when they haue heard goddes worde and beleued that same: no doute all the feare of death wilbe vanished & gone quite a way. For they shall fynde in gods worde, that deathe hath loste his strength, that he can not hurte any more. Likewise they that be dronkardes, that is to say, that be

                     I wyll aske here a great clearkly question, where was the
                           
                              〈◊〉
                            question. soule now after it went oute of this yong mayde? it was not in heauen nor in hel, nam in inferno non est redemptio, there is no redemption in hell, where was it then? in purgatorye? so the papistes haue reasoned, it was not in hell nor in heanen, ergo it was in purgatory: which no doute is a vaine folish argumēt. Now I wil make a clearkely answer vnto my 
                           〈◊〉
                        : & such an answer that if yt bishop of Rome woldhaueA clearkly aunsvver. gone no further, we shold haue bene wel enough: there wold not haue bene such errors & fooleries in religiō, as there hath ben. Now my answer is this, I cā not telbut where it plesed god it shold be, ther it was. Is this not a good answer to such a clerakly 
                           〈◊〉
                        ? I think it be, other answer no body gettes

at me: because scripture telleth me not where she was.
                     Now ye haue heard that our sauiour is the lord ouer death and so consequently very god: because he raised vp this yong woman which was dead. But peraduenture ye will saye, it is no great matter that he raised vp a mayden whiche was dead: for we reade of Elisa the prophete, that he raised vp a yong man from death. Answer, truth it is, he raysed him vp, but not by his owne power, not in hys owne name, but by the power of god: he dyd it not by himselfe. but Christ our sauiour, he raised vp Lazarus, and this yong mayd by his own diuyne power: the wing himself to be very god, and the sonne of the father eternall: therfore he saith, Ego sum resurrectioChrist raised vp the dead by his ovvne povver. & vita, I am the resurrection and the life: This was his doctrins: Now to proue that doctrine to be true, he did myracles by 
                           〈◊〉
                         owne diuyne power, she wyng hymselfe to bee verye god: so did not the prophetes, they were goddes seruauntes, gods ministers: but they were not gods themselues, neyther did they any thing in theyr owne name.
                     Now to make an end, let vs remember what we haue herd, lette vs take hede that we be not customable sinners: but rather let vs stryue with sinne, for I tell you, there be but few of those that spende all theyr tyme in the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the fleshe, that spede well at the end: therfore let vs take hee

                        , yt murtherer vpō the crosse he sped wel: but what then, let vs not presume to tary in wyckednes styll, to the last poynte of our lyfe: let vs leaue wickednes, and stryue with our fleshly affections: than we shall attayne in the

                         to that fellcity, which god hath prepared for al them that loue him: to whom with ye sonne, and holy ghost, be all honor and glory.

Firste in paradise, when God spake of the womans sede, saith: Conteret caput serpentis, The sede of the woman shall breake the serpentes head. And this was a gospell, a glad tidyngs: for the serpent had deceued Adam and Eue, brought them from their felicitie, to which they were

And no dout as many as dyd beleue these wordes, and did put theyr hope in the sede of the woman, and beleued to bee deliuered from theyr synnes thorow that sede: As many I say, as beleued so, were saued, as Seth, Enoch, and other good and godly mē, which wer at that time: but there was not a great numbre of those: For the most part euer was the worst.

Christe, we are vnder the curse of God. And agayne by Christ we haue the benediction of God. Lykewise this gospell was opened vnto Dauid, and al the holy prophetes: They spake of this gospell, and taught the people to looke for their sauiour: but their sayings and

Therfore Christ our sauior saith to his disciples:Luc. 10. Happie are the eies which see these thinges that ye see: for IMath 13. tell you, that many prophets and kynges haue desired to se those thinges which ye see, and haue not seene them: And to heare those thynges which ye

                         were blessed which saw him: the asse whervpon he rode was blessed, yea his very ennemie Annas and Cayphas, and Pylate, and other that consented vnto his deathe were blessed. But it is not so, ye must vnderstande that oure sauiour in that maner of speaking putteth only a difference betwene the 
                           〈◊〉
                        . For at that tyme whan he was here in earth, he was more clerer reueled thā afore, whā he was only promised to come. When he dyd myracles, cast out deuyls, healed the sicke, it was a more 
                           〈◊〉
                         reuelation: than when God said, Semen mulieris conteret caput serpentis, The sede of the woman shall breake the head of the serpent. When Iohn Baptist pointed and shewed hym with his fynger, it could better be vnderstande then the prophecies which were spoken of him: Therfore this blessednes whereof Christe speaketh, and saint Paule (whan he saith) That our saluationThe diffe rence of the tym e vvherein Christe was diue? sly reueled is come nerer, must be vnderstand of the diuersity of the tyme: for Christ was clerer reueled in the end of the worlde than before. But as touching the blessednes which we haue by Christe: it was alike at al times, for it stood Adam in as good stead to beleue the fyrst promyse which god made vnto

him, and he was as well saued by it, in beleuing 
                           〈◊〉
                         Christe shold come, as we be, which beleue that he is come, and hath suffred for vs. So likewise the prophetes are saued in beeleuyng that he should come, and suffer, and deliuer mankinde by his most painful death. But now sence he is come in dede and hath ouercome the deuill & redemed our sinnes, suffered the paynes, not for his owne sake, but for oure sakes: for he him selfe had no sinne at all, he suffred to deliuer vs fromeChrist had no syn, but toke out syn and gaue vs his

                         slepe, we must set aside slouthfulnes with all other vyces and sinnes. But I praye you what is syn? I thinke there be many which can commit sinne, and do wickedly: but I think there be but few of those

                            sin is. which know what is sin. Therfore I wil tel you what is sin: al that yt is done against the lawes of god, cōtrary to his wil and plesure, that is sinne and wickednes. Now there be twoTvvo maner of

                            es, general and speciall. maner of lawes. There be general lawes pertaining to euery man and woman, and there bee speciall lawes: the generall lawes are comprehended in the ten commandementes, which ten commaundementes are comprehended in the lawes of loue. Thou shalt loue god with al thy heart. &c. And thy neighbour as thy selfe, these be generall lawes.
                     Now then there be special lawes which teach vs how euery man and woman shall liue in their callyng, whereunto god hath called them. These 
                           〈◊〉
                         teach how magistrates shall

do their duety, execute iustice, punish the wicked, defend the good, to see that the common welth bee well ordred, and gouerned, that the people lyue godly euery mā in his calling. So lykewise maried folke haue their speciall callyng and lawes. There is appointed in scripture how the man shall nourish his wife, rule her with al lenity, and 
                           〈◊〉
                        : the woman likewise shall obey her husband, be louing & kynde towardes him. So masters ought to do according vnto their callyng, that is to rule their house well and godly, to see that their 
                           〈◊〉
                         be well occupied, and to let them haue their meate and drynke and wages. So seruauntes haue theyr lawes: 
                           〈◊〉
                         is to obey their maisters, to do

                         all businesNo obedi ence against god whatsoeuer their masters commaund vnto them, so far as it is not against god. For when a maister will commaund vnto his seruaunts to do such thinges whiche are agaynste god, then the seruaunt ought not to obey to do those things.
                     Now whosoeuer transgresseth these lawes, eyther the generall lawes, or the speciall lawes, he sinneth: and that whiche is done contrary to these lawes, is synne. When ye will know now whether ye haue sinned or not, see and considerLearne to fynde

And this is it yt S. Paule saith, let vs arise from the slepe of sinne and wickednes, for our saluation is come

                     But there be two

                         consisteth this penance; The right penance consisteth in three points, The first is

                        , that is, I must acknowledge my selfe that I haue transgressed gods most holy

                           〈◊〉
                         my selfe and my wickednesse. When I am nowe in that case, then I shall see nothing but helle and euerlastyng damnation before me, as long as I looke vpon my selfe and vpon the law of god. For the lawe of God when it is preached bryngeth vs to the knowledgeThe lavve of God is a

                            glasse. of oure synnes: For it is lyke as a glasse whiche sheweth vs the spottes in our faces, that is the sinnes in our heartes. But we may not tary here onely in the law and oure selues: For if we do, we shall come to desperation. Therfore yt first pointe is to acknowledge our sinnes, and to bee sory for the same: but as I said before, we must not tary here: for IudasFaith must be ioyned with oure repentāte was come so farre, he had this poynte: he was no doute a sorowfull man as any can be in the world. But it was to no purpose, he was lost for al his sorowfulnes: therfore we must haue an other pointe. what is that: Mary saithe, beliefe: we must beleue Christ, we must know that our sauiour is come into this worlde to saue synners: therefore he is called Jesus, because he shall saue his people frome theyr synnes: As

                           〈◊〉
                         beleeueth not that he shall haue parte of it, that his wickednesse shall bee forgeuen vnto hym, this he beleueth not: he hath but a generall

                        : but I say, that euery of one of vs must haue a speciall faith: I must beleue for my selfe, that his blood was shed forEuery 
                              〈◊〉
                            that vvilbe be saued, must haue a speciall faith. me. I must beleue that when Christ saith: Come to me all ys that labour and are laden, and I will ease you. Here I must beleue that Christ calleth me vnto hym, that I should come and receyue euerlastyng lyfe at his handes: With such a special faith I do apply his passion vnto me. In that prayer that our Sauiour made when he was goyng to his deathe, 
                           〈◊〉
                         sayth: I pray not for them alone, saith

                         which shal beleue in me through their preching, that they

                         may be one, as thou father art in me, & I in thee: and that

                            of penance. our synnes, be

                         for them, they 
                           〈◊〉
                         vs very sore. The second pointe is faith, when we beleue that god wilbe mercifull vnto vs, and thorough his sonne forgeue vs our wicked nes, & not 
                           〈◊〉
                         the same to oure eternal destruction. But yet there is an other point left behind, which is this: yt I must haue an earnest 
                           〈◊〉
                         to leaue sinne, & to auoide al wicked nes as far forth as I am able to do: I must wrastle wt sin: I mustnot suffer yt diuel to haue the victory ouer me though he be very suttle and crafty, yet I must withstand him: I muste 
                           〈◊〉
                         his

                        , and suggestions, I muste not suffer synne to beare rule ouer me: for no doute yf we wyll syght and striue, 
                           〈◊〉
                         may haue the victorye ouer this serpent: for Christ our sauiour he hath promised vnto vs his help & cō
                        fort:

therfore s. Iames saith, Resistite diabolo & fugiet a vobis, withstand the diuel, and he shal flye fro you. For at hysVVe may ouercome the diuell. first cōming he is very weake, so yt we

                         able if we wil take hede & 
                           〈◊〉
                        , to ouercome hym: but if we suffer him to enter ones to possesse our hearts, then he is very 
                           〈◊〉
                        : so that he wt great labour can 
                           〈◊〉
                         he brought out agayne. For he entreth first by yll thoughtes: then when he hath cast vs in yll thoughtes, yf we withstand not by and by, then foloweth de lectation: yf we suffer that, then commeth consentyng, and so from consentyng to the verye acte: and afterwarde from one mischiefe vnto another: therfore it is a common saying,Resist

                     So ye haue hearde now wherin standeth right penaunce: fyrst we must knowe and acknowledge our sinnes, be sorie for them, and lament them in our heartes. Then the second point is faith: we must beleue that Christ wilbe merciful vnto vs, and forgeue vs our sinues, not impute them vnto vs. Thirdelye we must haue an earnest purpose to leaue all sinnes and wickednes, and no more commit the same. And thē euer be 
                           〈◊〉
                         in thy heart, yt they that haue a good will and an earnest minde to leaue synne, that god will strengthē them, he wil helpe them. But and if we by and by at the first clappe giue place vnto the diuel, and folow his mischeuous suggestions: then we maie be sure, that we highlye displease god our heauenly father, when we forsake him so soone. Therfore S. Paule saieth: Ne regnet igitur peccatum in vestroRom. 6. mortali corpore, let not synne beare rule in your 
                           〈◊〉
                         bodies: be not led with synne: but fight agaynste it. whē we do so, it is impossible but we shall haue helpe at goddes hande.
                     As touchinge confession, I tell you that they that can bee content with the generall absolution which euerye minister of gods worde geueth in his sermons, when he pronoūceth, that all that be sorye for their sinnes, and beleue in Christe, seeke helpe and remedy by him, and afterwarde intend to amende theyr liues, and

that be so mynded shall haue remission of their sinnes. Now (I say) they that can be content with this general absolutiō, it is well: but they that are not

                     John the Euangelist saieth, that Andrewe was a disciple of John Baptiste: and when he had seene his master pointe Christ with his finger, saying: Ecce

                         thee, that he can bryng thee alofte when it pleaseth him, when it is to the furtherāce of his glorye, and to the saluation of thy soule. John Baptist made no sute for that office namely to be a preacher, and to baptyse ye people: yet for all that god sought hym oute, god called hym there unto, god would haue him in this office of preachyng: So lyke wise Iosephe when he was in Egypte, solde of hys owne brethren, where he serued with a great man, a greate officer he was, Potiphar was his name: Nowe when he had bene a whyle with him, his 
                           〈◊〉
                         percetuyng his beauty,Gene 39. cast her loue vpon him, and so would haue hym to be naught with her: but Joseph beyng a man that seared god, wold not folow her, but rather 
                           〈◊〉
                         her beastly lustes, ranne his wayes, and lefte his cloke behynde hym. And so 
                           〈◊◊〉
                         thorough false accusations, he was cast into prison. ThynksCod sawe Ioseph in the prison ye now that god saw hym not? yes yes, he sawe him, though he was in the darke pryson, yet he saw him. For when it seemed him good, he brought him out agayne of the prison, and made him lorde and ruler ouer all Egipt: though he lay in a dongeon, though he could make no sute for his 
                           〈◊〉
                        , yet god when it pleased him could call him therunto. Therfore let vs learne here, by the ensaumple of this good Josephe: lette vs learne I saye, that when we bee meete, and that God wyll haue vs to beare offices, he wyll call vs thereunto by law full meanes, by hys magistrates: he wyll not forgette vs: for he seeth vs in euery corner, he can pycke vs oute when it is hys wyll and pleasure.

And thys Moses was very lothe to go, to take such a greate charge vpon hym: yet at the length he went, because it was the callyng of god. Therfore let vs folow this ensaumple of Moyses, let vs not take in hande any office, except we be called thereunto of GOD, excepte we haue a lawfull callyng. Oure Sauiour commaundeth his disciples, and also vs, thatLuke. 10. we shall praye vnto God, that he wyll sende labourers into his haruest: that is to saye, that he wyll sende preachers. Whereby it appeareth, that our Sauiour woulde that no person shoulde take vpon hym that office, excepte he be sent of god, except god call hym thereunto.

                     Here ye see moste manifestlye that whanne GOD wyll haue a thynge to bee doone, he canne synde suche meanes, whereby it muste needes bee doone. Wherefore shoulde nowe anye of vs goe aboute to thruste theymselues into offices wyithoute the callyng of GOD? And no doute they that

These thynges are written for our sake, to make vs lustie to folowe oure vocation, and to doo as we are appointed of God to doo. Further, when the people of Israel were in the wildernes, they had a vacation: for God commaunded Moses to bryng theym out of Egypte: Nowe he brought them in the wildernes, where there was no corne nor any thing to

So lykewyse a scruyng man maye vse shootyng or other pastymes: but yf a seruyng manne woulde doe nothyng elles but to shoote, settyng asyde hys maysters busynes, thys manne no 
                           〈◊〉
                         shoulde not doe well: for a seruyng mans duetye is to

                     Our sauiour wente ones abroade, and by the waye as heMath. 8. went, be sayde to one, Folow me: the felow made answere, saying, let me fyrste bury my father: our sauiour saide vnto hym agayn, let the dead bury their dead, and come thou & fo low me. where our sauior teacheth vs, that when we haue a speciall vocation, we shall forsake the generall: for to burye fatherand mother is a godly deede, for god commaunded to honour father and mother: yet when we haue such a speciallOne speciall vocatiō must bee folovved. callyng as this man had, we must leaue al other vocations: for our sauiour wold rather haue ye dead to bury the dead, thē that this man shoulde forsake or set asyde his vocation.

For their special callyng is to fishe, to preache the worde of God, and to bryng the people from ignorance vnto the knowledge of gods word, this they ought to do. Abraham the Patriarke hadde a vocation when god called hym oute of hys countree, this was a vocation.Abraham did folovv his calling So likewise when god commaundeth him to offer his sonne he was redy and wyllyng to doe it: for because god had commaunded hym, he made no excuses, but wente and folowed his vocation most diligently and earnestly. But this I wold haue you to note wel, that they that hauebut general vocati ons, may not folow those which haue special vocations. AsThe

Phinees that godly mā, seeyng one of the great men of Israel do wickedly with a naughtye womā, went thither and killed them both, whilest they wer yet doyng the act of lecherye. Nowe in so doyng, he pleased god, and is highly commended of god for it: shal we now folow the ensample of Phinces? shal we kil a man by and by

when he doth wickedly? No not so, we haue no such commaū dement of god as Phinees had: for he had a special callyng, aNume. 25 secrete inspiration of god to do such a thing: we which haue no such calling may not folowe hym, for we ought to kyl no body, the magistrates shall redresse all matters.
                     So to preache gods worde it is a good thyng, and god wil haue yt there shalbe some which shall doe it: but for all that a man may not take vpon him to preache gods worde excepte he be called vnto it: when he doth it, he doth not well, though he haue learnyng and wisedome to be a preacher, yet for all that he ought not to come hymselfe without any laufull callyng: for it was no doute a good thyng to kepe the arke from fallyng, yet for all that Oza was striken to deathe, because he toke in hand to medle with it without any commission.

thou art not able, then thou must be forse for it in thy hearte, and aske god forgiuenes. This I tolde you at the same time where I slaundered no bodye: therfore I woulde wishe that ye woulde expounde my wordes now forwardes, better then ye haue hitherto.
                     Nowe to the matter agayne: when a man shoulde aske this question, saying: we are all bounde to worke, for our lyuynges: but I praye you by whome commeth the gayne of oure workes: who geueth the increase of it: There bee some people whiche thynke, that they bryng all thynges to passe by theyr labour: they thynke they gette theyr liuinges wyth theyr owne hand worke. Some agayne there be, which think that the encrease of theyr labour commeth by the diuell, thatSome think that their encrease com meth of the deuill. he increaseth and blesseth theyr labours. But thynke ye that any body wyll saye so, that his increase commeth by the dyuell: No I warraunt you, they wyll not saye so, wyth theyr mouth: yet for all that, their conuersation and lyuing sheweth it to be so in dede with them. For all they that liue of vsurye, they haue theyr gaynes by the diuell. So lykewise all they that sell false wares, or sell by false wayght, or vse anye maner of falshode, they be in the deuylles seruice, they haue his liuery: therfore they seke all theyr gaynes at his handes, thorough false and deceytfull dealyng. And so it appeareth that the diuell is the increase of theyr gaynes. And no doute the diuell taketh vpon hym to be the lorde ouer all thynges in earth: as it playnely appeareth by the gospell of Mathew,Math. 4. where he toke in hande to tempte Christe oure sauiour, and broughte hym vpon a high hyll, where he shewed vnto hym all the kyngdomes of the world, saying: Haec omnia dabo tibi, si prostratus adoraueris me, Al these things I wil geue vn to thee, yf thou wilt fal doun & worship me. By these words it appeareth, that the diuell beareth himselfe in hande to beThe diuell is not vvorthe a goose

                           . lorde and ruler ouer the whole worlde: but in very deede he hath not so muche as a goose fether by righte. Andyet for all that, he hath many children here vpon earth, which hange vpon hym, and seeke theyr increaso by hym thorough falshode and deceite. Therefore suche worldlynges haue a common saying amongest them, they say when a man wylbe ryche, he

muste sette his soule behinde the doore: that is to say, he must vse falshode and deceit. And therfore I feare me there be manyMany set their soules behind the dore. thousandes in the worlde which set theyr soules behynde the dores. The merchaunte commonly in euery citye dothe teache his prentise to sell false wares. So that a man maye say to all cities as Esay sayth to Hierusalem: Argentum tuumEsay. 1. versum est in scoriam, thy siluer is turned in drosse, thy ware is false, thou hast a delite in falshode and deceite, thou gettest thy good per fas & nefas, by lauful and vnlauful mea nes: But the increase that the godlye man hath, commeth of god, as the scripture saith: Benedictio dei facit diuitem, The blessyng of god maketh ryche. Now there be some that wyllProuer. x. say, if the blessyng or the increase rome not of my labor, then I wyll not labour at all. I wyll tary tyll god sendeth me my foode, for he is able to fede me without my labor or trauel. No, we must labour, for so are we commaunded to doe, but we must looke for the increase at gods handes: lyke as Peter dyd, he laboured the whole nyght, yet he toke nothyng at all tyll Christ came. And yet this is not a certaine rule, he that much laboreth shall haue much. For though a man labour muche, yet for all that he shall haue no more then god hathe appoynted hym to haue: for euen as it pleaseth GOD, so he shall haue, Nam domini est terra & plenitudo eius, For thePsalm. xiiii earthe is the Lordes, and all that is therein: and when weHe that hath much must accompt for much. haue muche, then we are accountable. For muche, for no doute we must make a reckenyng for that which we receius at gods handes.
                     Nowe to make an ende, I desire you lette vs consider oure generall vocation, that is to say lette vs labour, euerye one in that estate wherein GOD hathe sette hym, and as for the increase, lette vs looke for it at goddes handes: and lette vs bee contente with that whiche GOD shall sende vs: For he knoweth what is beste for vs, yf we haue VictumTim. 6. & vestitum, meate and drynke, and clothyng, lette vs bee contente wythall. For we canne not tell whenne good manne deathe wyll comme and make an ende of all together.
                     
                     And yf we haue speciall vocations, let vs set asyde the generall, and apply the speciall poyntes of our vocation, rather then the accidentes: and let vs labour in our callyng, and yet not thynke to get any thynge by it, but rather trust in God, and seke the increase at his handes: let vs looke for his benediction, then it shall go well with vs: but aboue all thinges beware of falshode, for with falshod we serue the deuyl. But as I tolde you before, I feare me the deuill hath a great num ber of seruauntes in England.
                     The almighty god graunt vs grace to liue so here in thys worlde, and to apply our busines in such wise, that he maye be glorifyed amongest vs: so that we maye finallye come to that felicity which he hath prepared for vs.

                            an Aposta ta and per secutour. was an Apostata, for he had bene a Christian: and after he came to be Emperor, he forsoke the christian faith and al goodnes and godlines: and not only that but he did al that he could to vanquishe and pul doune Christes true religion: and therefore he went about to sette vppe the Jewes agayn, and gaue them liberties to gather themselues together, and to returne agayne to Jerusalem: and not onelye gaue them this liberty, but also he holpe them with al maner of thyng, that they might bring to passe their purpose: & so vpon that the Jewes gathered themselues together in an infinite num ber of people, and went to Jerusalem: and so began to make preparations for the buildyng of the temple, and so finallye layed the foundation. The storye saith, that this hoste of the Jewes was a wonderfull ryche hoste: for their mattockes, & spades, and ye other instruments, which they occupied to the buildyng of the temple, were made of fyne syluer. So these Jewes hadde the Emperoures fauour, his aide and healpe, they were ryche and able to set vp their kingdome agayne: and so falsifye the worde of god after mans reason: for they lacked no worldly thynges. But what dothe God? when he saw that no man would withstand them, to verify his word, he sendeth a wynde, a strong hurlyng wynd, whiche blue awayGod can blovv whā he vvill. all their prouisions, whiche was made for the buildyng of the temple, all the sande and morter and such lyke things, whiche men vse in suche buildinges: and after that, there came such an earthquake, that they were almost out of their wittes. And this was not inough, but there came also fyre & burned by all their workes: and so finally they wer scattered agayne one from another. So by these stories, it manifestlye appeareth, that no mans power is able to stand against god, or to disapoint him of his purposes: for Christe our Sauiour had tolde them, that they shoulde neuer come to their rule agayn. And so his wordes are verified tyll this day, and shall be styll to the worldes ende: for he sayth, Coelum & terra peribuntMath. v. verba autem meum non peribit, heuen and earth shall perishe, but my worde shall endure for euer. A man woulde thynke that there were nothyng so durable as heauen & earth

is: yet for all that, they shall rather perish, then that the word of god should be falsified. And this appeared in the Jewes, which though they had the aid & help of this great emperor, & the mighty power of this world: yet for al that they brought nothing to passe at all, for god was able to confounde them: and so no doute he will confound all his enemies, tyll thendGod is

I woulde haue you to consider well the causes wherfore they were caste awaye from God, and were made a mockyng stocke vnto the whole worlde. wherfore I saye? Marye for their wicked and synfull lyues.

The temple whiche was at Jerusalem was called the temple of god, the people was goddes people, but when they woulde not come vnto hym, and lyue accordyng as he woulde haue them to lyue, he caste them away, and vtterlye destroyed theyr dominions and kyngdomes, and made them slaues and bondmen for euer. And no doute this is wrytten for our instruction and warnyng: for no doute when we folow them in theyr wyckednes, despyse gods worde, regarde it as nothyng, but lyue rather according vnto our phantasies and appetites, than after his woorde: No doute we shall receyue lyke reward with thē.

This is nowe a comfortable thynge and a greate promise, whiche GOD maketh vnto the whole worlde. And no dout he is as able to fulfyll that promise of grace, as he was able to fulfyll hys wrathfull worde agaynste the Jewes.
                     So lykewise he saieth: Viuo ego dicit domin, nolo mortemExcc, xviii peccatoris sed vt conuertatur & viuat, As truely as I lyue (saieth the Lorde god) I wyll not the deathe of a synner, but rather that he shall turne and lyue.

Now therfore yf we wyll folow hym and leaue our wic ked lyuyng, conuerte and turne our selfes vnto hym, be sory for that which is paste, & intende to antend our lyfe now forward: yf we do so, no doute we shal lyue wt hym euerlastingly, world without ende. Therfore let euery one of vs go in to hys owne heart, and when he fyndeth that he hath brne a wycked man, an yrefull man, a couetuous or a slouthefull man: lette hym repente and bee sorye for it. And take a good purpose to leaue that same synne, where in he hath lyen before. Lette vs not doe as the Jewes dydde, which were styfnecked, they woulde not leaue theyr synnes, they hadde a pleasure in the same, they woulde folowe theyr olde tradicions,The reward of the suffe necked. refusyng the worde of GOD: therefore theyr destruction came worthelye vppon theym. And therefore (I saye) lette vs not followe them, leaste we receyue suche a reward as they hadde, leaste euerlastyng destruction come `vpon vs, and so we be caste oute of the fauour of god, and finally loste worlde without ende.

                         is to repent betymes, whyle we haue tyme, and to be sory for our wyckednes, and to take an earnest mynd and purpose to leaue synne: when we do so, then no doute we shalbee taken vp with Christe, and dwell with him in heauen euerlastingly, in great honor and glory1 Cor. a. where we shal haue such ioy, which no tonge cā expresse, no eies hath

                     And then shall they see the sonne of man come in a cloude with power and great glory. Saincte Paule to the Thessalonians setteth out the commyng of Christe and our resurrection: but he speaketh in the same place onely of the rysynge of the good and 
                           〈◊〉
                         that shall bee saued. But the holye Scripture in other places wytnesseth, that the wycked shall ryse to, and shall receyue their sentence of Christ, and so go to hell, where they shalbe punished world without ende. Now S. Paules wordes be these. This saye we vnto you in the word of the Lord: that we which shal liue1. Thes. 4. and shall remayn in the comyng of the lord, shal not come be fore them which slepe. For the lorde himself shall descend frō heauen with a shoute, and the voyce of the Archaungell and trompe of god, and the deade in Christ shall aryse first: then we which shall lyue, 
                           〈◊〉
                         we whiche shall remayne, shal bee caught vp with them also in the cloudes to meete the Lorde in the 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and so shall we euer be with the Lord. wherfore comfort your selues one another with these wordes.
                     By these wordes of S. Paule it appereth, that they which died in the beginning of the world shalbe as soone by Christ as they which shalbe aliue here at the time of his commyng.S. Paule thought the last dayes might com in his

                         I would haue you to note well the maner of speaking 
                           〈◊〉
                         S. Paule vseth he speaketh like as if the last day should haue bene come in his tyme. Now when S. Paule thought that this day should haue bene come in his tyme: how much more shal we thynke that it shalbe in our tyme? For no dout he will come, and it is no longe thereunto, 
                           〈◊〉
                         it appeareth by all scriptures whiche make mention of this daye: it wyll come, but it shall come sodenly, vnwares, as a theefe in the night. For a theefe when he intendeth a robbery, to robbe a mans house, to 
                           〈◊〉
                         vppe his

                        , and take away hys goods, he geueth hym not warnyng, he letteth not the goodThe laste day 
                              〈◊◊〉
                            to a theefe. manne of the house knowe, at what time he entendeth to come: but rather he entendeth to 
                           〈◊〉
                         suche a tyme, that no man shal be ware of hym. So no doute this laste daye wyll come one day sodenly vpon our heades, before we bee ware

of it, like as the fyre fell doune 
                           〈◊◊〉
                         vpon the

                         for: they thought that all thynges were well, therefore they toke theyr pleasures, tyll at suche tyme when the fyre fell

                         from heauen and burned them vp al, with all theyr substance and goods.
                     So lykewise as it hapned vnto the first world, whych wold not amende their liues, but folowed theyr carnal

                        , and appetites, god sent the floude vppon their heades, and so

                         them altogether.

                         let vs take

                         vpon the first worlde, and vpon the Sodomites.
                     Saint Hierome that holy man writeth in a place, that heS. Hierom loked for: the

                         ye see the tokēs which shal go before this feareful day, it is tyme to make redye. But here a man might aske a question, saying: I pray you wherin

                         this preparation? how shall I make me redye? Aboute this matter hathe ben great

                        : they thought to bee made redye towardes that day: and so to be made worthy to stand before the sonne of man, that is before our sauiour Christe. But I tell you this was not the right way to make ready. Christ our sauior he sheweth vs how we shal make redy our selues, saying. Take heede to your selues leaste at any time your hearts be ouercome with

                           〈◊〉
                         we ought not to be carefull for this lyfe, we should labour and doe our busines diligently, euery one in that estate, in which god hath

                         hym, and let vs trust in god, which no doute wil sende vs increase of our labour. Therfore Christ addeth, saying: Vigilate &

                     VUhen Iohn beyng in prison heard the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples, and said vnto him, art thou he that shall come, or doe we loke for another: Iesus answe red and said vnto them, goe and shew Iohn agayne, what ye haue

                     It beginneth this, when Iohn beyng in pryson hearde the workes of Christ: and here is to bee had in consideration, of whome he had heard these wonderfull workes which our sauiour did, for he could not heare it without a seller, som body tolde him of it. The Cuangelist Luke in the 7. cap. doth shew, how and by whom Iohn Baptist heard such thinges,Luke. 7 which our sauiour Christ did: namely by hys own disciples.

                            dis ciples told him of the workes of Christ. For when our sauiour had raised vppe the widowes soune, which was deadat Naine, the disciples of Iohn came by and by, vnto Iohn theyr

                        , and tolde hym all thyngs: name lye how Christ raised vp that same young man, whiche had bene dead already. And thys is a thynge to be mcruasled at, that Iohn had so much libertye: that hys disciples could come

                         the widow, which was now a miserable

                           . But what doth our sauiour: Mary he comforted her, saying wepe not. Here may al widowes, which are destitute of com forte in this worlde, here (I say) they may learne to truste in Christe, and to seeke ayde and helpe by him. For no doute, like as he hath comforted this miserable widowe: so he wyll comfort and helpe all them that call vpon him, in their nede and necessity. For his hand is not abbreuiated, or his power diminished: he is as strong, as ryche, & as mighty as euer he was: therfore let wydowes learn here to seeke ayde and help by him. Now, when he had comforted her with his words, he came nye, and touched the coffyne: and they that bare the cof fyne

Now vpon this there went suche a rumour thoroughout all the countreys, so that euery mā merueiled at it. And Johns disciples went to theyr maister & told him of it, what wonderfull thynges he dyd. Note here, that when we heare, yt our sauiour is a doer of such wonderful su pernatural works, it shalbe a wonderous great comfort vnto vs. For by this his dede, it appeared manifestly, that he is a maister ouer deathe: and hathe power to commaunde him: so that death is in his dominion. For, to raise a man vp, whom

This is now an ercedyng comforte, to all chri stian people: for they may be assured, that when they beleue in Christe, when Christe taketh theyr partes, there shalbee nothyng, neyther in heauen, nor in earth, that shalbee able to hurte them, or lette theym of theyr saluation: and so we learne by thys wonderfull myracle, which our sauior did before all the multitude, that he proued himself to be very god, and one that hath power ouer death.An

                     To this question, or obiection, I wyll aunswere hereafter, and if I forget it not. In the meane season, I wyll inoue an other question, which is this. What shoulde moue JohnsAnsvver by an other question. disciples: to come and tell him the miracles which Christ our sauior dyd: thynke ye they came with a good wyll to sette out Christe, and to magnifye hys doynges: or came they with an yll wyll, with an enuious hearte, whiche they beare towardes Christe? Aunswere. They came wyth an yll wyll, wyth an enuious hearte, whiche they barc agaynste Christe: as it appeareth moste 
                           〈◊〉
                        , by the circumstaunces beynge well considered. For ye muste vnderstande, that John hadde verye muche 
                           〈◊〉
                        , to brynge his disciples to Christe: they thoughte that Christe and hys doynges, hys conuersation, were nothynge in comparison of John. For Johns strayghte lyfe, whiche he led in the wyldernesse, made suche a shewe and outewarde glisteryng, that oure Sauiour was

regarded for nothyng, in comparison of hym. For our sauiour led not so harde and straight a lyfe, as Iohn did: he eats and drunke, and woulde come to mens tables, when he was bidden: he would kepe company with euery body, ryche, and poore: 
                           〈◊〉
                         receiued hym: and woulde beleue in hym: but Iohn was in the wyldernes, out of the companye of all men. Therfore the disciples of Iohn, they much more regarded Iohn their maister, then Christ their sauiour. And therefore they euer lay vpon Iohn, in exhortyng hym, yt he wouldIohns dis ciples vvo'dhaue had hym Christ. take vpon him to be Christ, and the sauiour of the worlde.
                     And when they had heard of any miracles, that Christe had done, they by and by came vnto theyr maister, and told hym of it disdainfully: as who say, thus and thus, we haue heard that Christ hath done: wherfore shewest not thou thy selfe to: wherfore workest not as well myracles as Christ doth? euery man speaketh of hym: do thou somwhat too, that the people may know thee to be a great man as well as Christ. We reade in the gospell of Mathew, that Iohns disciples came once to Christ, and quarelled with hym, saying: Cur nos & Math. ix. pharisaei ieiunamus frequenter, discipuli autem tui non ieiunāt? Wherfore fast we, and the pharisees, so many a tymes, but thy disciples fast not at al? They thought in theyr owne opinions, that Iohns lyfe was a great deale more to be estemed then Christes, because Iohns lyfe was more painfull, in the outward shew of the world: therfore it greued them that Christ shold be more estemed then Iohn. So yt we may perceiue by Iohns disciples, that they had a good zeale, Sed non secundum scientiam, but not accordyng vnto knowledge.Iohns dis ci ples dyd naught.
                     
                     For it is a good thing, for a seruaunt to loue his maister: but Iohns disciples did naught in that they enuied Christe, and wente aboute to styrre vppe theyr maister to take vpon him to be Christe. Nowe Iohn, entending to correcte and amend theyr false opinion, which they hadde in Christ, and in hym: (for they regarded him to muche, and Christe whiche was to bee moste regarded, him estemed they for nothinge, in compaIohn plai eth a wisepart. rison of Iohn: therfore Iohn, that good and faithfull man, seyng the ignorauncy of hys disciples, playeth a wyse part, For hearyng them talke of the wonderfull workes, whyche

Christ our sauiour dyd, he sendeth them vnto Christe: with thys question: Art thou he that shall come, or shall we looke for another?
                     When we loke onely vpon the outward shew of these wordes, a man might thinke, that Iohn hymselfe, was doutefull whether Christ were the sauiour of the world or not, because he sendeth his disciples to aske such a question of hym. But ye must vnderstand, that it was not done for Iohns sake, to aske such a question, but rather for his disciples sake. For Iohn thought that this should be the way, to bryng them to a good trade, namely to no them to Christ. For as for IohnIohn knevve Christ in his mothers vvombe. hym selfe, he douted not, he knew that Christ was the sauior of the world, he knew it (I say) whiles he was yet in hys mo thers wombe. For we rede in the 
                           〈◊〉
                         of Luke: that after 
                           〈◊〉
                         came vnto Mary, and brought her such tidings, she arose and went thorough the mountaynes, and came to Ierusalem, to Elizabeth her cosyne: and as she saluted her, the Euangelist saith, saliit infans, in vtero suo, the infant, which was Iohn, lept in his mothers belly: So that Iohn beyng in his mothers belly yet, knew Christ which should be born out of the virgin Mary. After that we rede in the 3. of Mathews when Iohn 
                           〈◊〉
                         baptise Christ, he said vnto Christ, Ego poMath. 3. tius. I haue more nede to be baptised of thee, thē thou of me. So that it manifestly appeareth, yt Iohn douted not of Christ but knew moste certainly, that he was the eternal son of god & the 
                           〈◊〉
                         which was promised vnto the fathers, to come into the worlde. For it was told him, from aboue, that vpon whomsoeuer he should see the holy ghoste commyng downe from heauen 
                           〈◊〉
                        , that same was he, whiche afterwarde 
                           〈◊〉
                        : for Iohn after that he had baptised hym, sawe the holye ghoste come doune in a forme of a doue: further Iohn appointed hym with hys finger, sayinge: Ecce agnus 
                           〈◊〉
                         qui tollit peccata mundi See the lambe of God, whiche takethIohn. i. a way the synnes of the world. So (I say) it is most 
                           〈◊〉
                        , that Iohn hymselfe douted not: for he knew it assuredly, that Christe was the sauiour, but he did it onelye to remedye the doutes of hys discyples. Nowe when Iohns disciples

came to Christ, they dyd theyr message, saying: Es 
                           〈◊〉
                         ille, qui venturus est, an alium expectamus? Arte thou he that shall come, or shal we looke for another? What doth Christ?Christe shevved himself by dedes. he made not answere with wordes, but with the dedes: he made not muche adoo, in settyng oute himselfe, with greate wordes: but he shewed himselfe to be Christ in dede. For he doth such miracles, whiche no man els could do, but only he which was bothe very god and man. I would wishe of god, that we would doe so to: that when we bee asked a question, whether we bee Christians, whether we haue the gospell, the true word of god, or not, I would wyshe (I saye) that we coulde shewe our faith by our workes and godly conuersations: lyke as he shewed hymselfe to be Christ, by his acts and dedes: but I tell you, we be farre otherwise: our acts and dedes disagree farre from our profession. For we are wicked,VVe shevv not oure faith by ourvvorks we care not for gods laws, nor his words: we professe wt our mouth that we be the haters of synnes: but

                         conuersation sheweth, that we loue sinne, that we folow the same, that we haue a delite in it. So it appeareth, that our wordes and 
                           〈◊〉
                         agree not: we haue gods holy worde in our mouthe, but we folow yt wil & pleasure of the diuel in our outward

                         we may learn by the way, what a paciēt mā our sauior Christ was, which could so wel beare wt the grosenes of Iohns disciples: for they had

                         thei came to Christ, which refused thē not nor yet re uiled thē, but entreating thē most louingly & gently, beareth with their weakenes: leauing vs an

                         them out of our companye, as 
                           〈◊◊〉
                        , but

                         with their weakenes, like as Christ beareth with the disciples of John.
                     Now to my question which I moued before: how could theThe aunswere 
                              〈◊◊〉
                            before. workes whiche our Sauior dyd in raising vp the 
                           〈◊〉
                        , how could they proue him to be yt sauior of the world which was promised of God by his holy prophets, when other holy 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                        
didde the same workes as well as he? And this must be aun swered to, we may haue no doutes in that matter: for when we doute whether he be the very sauiour or not, then we cast doune the foundation of our fayth, and so brynge our selues to the very pytte of hell. Therefore this shalbe my answere, Elias and Elisa raised vp dead bodies, to proue by suche myracles that they were the right ministers of the 
                           〈◊〉
                         god: and that theyr doctrine was the true doctryne, and the 
                           〈◊〉
                         worde of god: to that end dyd they theyr miracles: but they neuer said we be Christes, or we be the sonnes of God, yea and very gods. No no, they neuer toke vpon them suche thynges: But our sauiour when he dyd the same workes, he toke vpon hym to be Christe, to be the sauiour of the world, to be the naturall sonne of god, and so to the confirmation of such his sayinges, he dyd such workes: therefore he saieth IIohn. 6. am the bread of life: Item Ego sum resurrectio & vita, I amIohn 
                              〈◊〉
                           . the resurrection and the lyfe. Item Ego sum via veritas & vita,Iohn. 
                              〈◊〉
                           . I am the waye, the truth, and the life, yea and when he talked with the woman at the well, she 
                           〈◊〉
                         vnto hym: when the Messias commeth he shall teache vs all thynges. ThenIohn. 4. he saith vnto her: I am he that speaketh vnto thee: I am that same Messias whiche was to come, and promised of God, I am he.
                     Further, he saith Venite ad me omne: qui laboratis, ComeMath. xi. to me al ye that labour and are laden, and I wil ease you. So it appeareth that Christ is the very sauiour of the world, because he dyd the dedes of our sauiour: and then again he toke vpon hym to be he in dede, and openly confessed it.
                     Further the time giueth it that Christ shoulde come, for so it was prophecied of the good holye father and 
                           〈◊〉
                         Iacob, when he blessed his sonnes, he said: The scepter shalGene. 49 not departe from Iuda, and a law geuer from betwene hys

                            of

                           . feete, vntill Schilo come: and vnto hym shall the gatheryng of the people be.
                     Now at that tyme when our sauiour was come, the scepter was taken from Iuda: for all Iurye was vnder the domini on of the 
                           〈◊〉
                        , therfore Schilo must needes come. So it appereth that by the reason of the tyme, Christ muste needes

come at the same season. So lykewise Daniell in his vision shewed, that after 62. wekes should Christ be 
                           〈◊〉
                        ,

                        . 
                           〈◊〉
                         shall haue no pleasure in him. So ye see that by the reasō of yt time he must nedes be the right sauior of al mankind, again Christ raised vppe the dead, and healed the

                         in his ownChrist

                           〈◊〉
                         he did all things, tanquā authoritatē habēs, as he that had authoritye.

                         tibi dico, surge, yong man, I saye vnto thee arise. So his works which he did by his own diuyne power, proue him to be very god, and yt same 
                           〈◊〉
                        , which was promised vnto the world.
                     Now when our 
                           〈◊〉
                         had told the disciples of

                         his wor kes and miracles which he did, he addeth a prety clause, and geueth them a goodly

But ye will say, how can a mā be hurt by him, from whom commeth no hurt at all? Mary I tel you, Iohns disciples were hurte of Christ, and yet the faulte was not in Christ but in them: Christ lyued a common lyfe, he was a good familiar man, he eate and dranke as other did he came to mens tables when he was called: in so much that some called hym a gloser: therfore the disciples of Iohn, 
                           〈◊〉
                         his symple life, were offended with him. But I praye you should Christ haue forsaken his maner of 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and folow the lyfe of Iohn, because some were offended with him? No not so. It was scandalum acceptum & non datum, they toke offences themselues, he gaue thē none: he did according

                         went frō him & forsoke hi they could not abide him. Now was Christ to be blamed for yt? because he said so? No no, for he said nothing but yt truth. So likewise yt preacher when he saith the truth, is not to be blamed though some be offended wt him. When Moses came into Egipt what

                        ? No, for he did nothing but yt which god cōmaūded him, but the Egiptiās, they wer obstinate, thei wold not obey the voice of god: therfore Moses hurt them not, but they hurt thē

                         offended wt it. As for an ensāple, here is a priest which

haue no neede to be holpē with any part of my labour in this thing. But yet, if ye wyl pardon me, I wyll wade somewhat deeper in this matter, and as nigh as I can, fetch it from the fyrst original beginning. For vndoutedly ye may much maruayl at this saying, if ye wel ponder both what is sayde; and who sayth it. Define me

I maruail if by & by ye al agree, that the children of the world should be wiser then the Children of the lyght. To com somwhat nighec the matter, thus the Lord

                  ¶ There was a certayne ryche man, that had a Stewarde, whych was accused vnto hym that he had

                      and wasted his goodes. This ryche man called his Steward to hym and sayde: What is this that I heare of thee: Come, make me an accompt of thy steward shyp: Thou mayest no longer beare thys office.
                  Brethren, because these woordes are so spoken in parable,

                        〈◊〉
                     , that 
                        〈◊〉
                      woordes of Christ do pertain vnto vs, and

                        〈◊〉
                      of our affaires. But my good 
                        〈◊〉
                     , erre not you so, stycke not you to such your imaginacions. For if ye in wardly beheld these woordes, if ye diligētly role them in your myndes, and after explicate and open them, ye shall see our 
                        〈◊〉
                      muche touched in these misteries. Ye shall

                      that god, by this example shaketh vs by the noses, and pulteth

vs by the eares. Ye shall perceyue very playne, that God setteth before our eies in this similitude, what we ought most to flee, and what we ought sonest to folow. For Luke sayth, the Lorde spake these wordes to his disciples. Wherefore let it be out of al doubt, that he spake them to vs, which euen as we wyll be compted the successours and 
                        〈◊〉
                      of Christes disciples, so we be, if we be good dispensers, and do our duitie. He said these thinges, partly to vs, whych spake them partly of hym selfe. For he is that riche man, which not onelye bad, but hath, and shal haue euermore, I saye not one, but manye Stewardes, euen to thend of the world.
                  He is man, seing that he is god & man. He is rich, not onelyChrist is rytch. in mercy, but in all kinde of ryches. For it is he, that giueth vs al thinges abundantly. It is he, of whose hand, we receyued both our lyues, & other thinges necessary for the conseruation of the same. What man hath any thing I praye you, but he hath receiued it of his plentyfulnes? To be short, it is he, that openeth his hand, and filleth al 
                        〈◊〉
                      with his blessyng, and not onely gyueth vnto vs, in most ample wyse his bendiction. Neyther his treasure can be spent, how much soChristes treasure cā not be spet euer he 
                        〈◊〉
                      but, how much so euer we take of him, his treasure tarieth still, euer taken, neuer spent.
                  He is also the good man of the house, the church is his housholde, which ought with al dilygēce, to be fed with his woord and his sacramentes. These be his goodes, most precious, the dispensation and administration wherof, he wold Byshops & Curates shuld haue. Which things. Paule affirmeth, saying:The office of Ministers. Let men esteeme vs, as the ministers of Christ, and dispensours of Gods misteries. But I pray you what is to be looked for in a dispensour? This surely, that he be found faythful and that he truely dispense & laye out the goodes of the Lord, that he gyue meate in tyme, giue it I saye, & not sel it: meate I saye, & not poyson. For the one doth intoricate and slea theMark maister person eater, the other feedeth and nourysheth him. Finally, let hym not 
                        〈◊〉
                      and differre the doing of his office, but let hym do his dutie whan tyme is, and neede requireth it. This is also to be looked for, that he be one, whom God hath called, and put in office, and not one that cōmeth vncald, vnsent for, not one that of hym selfe presumeth to take honour vpon hym.

What is to be looked for? Surely, if al this that I saye, be required in a good Minister, it is much lyghter to require them all in euery one, then to finde one any where, that hath them al.

Brethren, if a faythfull steward oughte to do, as I haue sayd, I praye you ponder and examyne this well, whether our

                      and Abbotes, Prelates and Curates haue bene hitherto faythfull stewardes or no? Ponder, whether yet many of thē be, as they should be or no.

                        〈◊〉
                      they thus preached to the people, that dead images (which at theDead yma. ges. first, as I thinke, were set vp onely to, represent thinges absent) not onely ought to be couered with golde, but also ought of al faythfull and christen people, yea in this scarsenes and penury of al thinges, to be cladde with sylke garmentes, and

to passe, that workes lucratiue, wil workes, mēs fancies reign & christian works, necessary works, fruitful workes, be trodē vnder the foote.

It is no meruayle, that they go aboute to keepe other in darknes, seeing they bee in darkenes, from top to toe ouerwhelmed with darknes, darker than is the darknes of hell. Wherfore it is well done, in all orders of men, but in especiall in the order of prelates, to put a difference betwene children of light, and children of the world, because great deceyte ariseth, in taking the one for the other.

God seeth all the whole holye dayes, to be spent miserablye in dronkennes, in glossing, in strife, in enuye, in daunsing, dicing, ydelnes and glottonye. He seeth al this, and threateneth punishment for it. He seeth it, which neither is deceyued in seeing, nor deceyueth when he threateneth. Thus men serue the Diuel, for God is not thus serued, al be it ye say, ye serue god. No the diuel hath more seruice done vnto hym on one holy day, then on many working daies. Let al these abuses be compted as nothing, who is he, that is not sory, to se in so many holy dayes, rytch and welthy persons to flowe in delicates, and men that lyue by theyr trauayl, poore men, to lacke necessary meate and drink for theyr wyues, and theyr children, and that they can not labour upon the holy dayes, except they wyl be cited & brought before our officials? Were it not the office of good prelates, to consult vpon these matters, and to seke some remedy for them? Ye shall se my brethren, ye shal se once, what wyl come of this our wynking.

No, rather, men commaunded them either not to be done at all, or els more slowlyer & seldomer to be don: for as much as our aūcetours made this constitution. We commaunde the Priestes that they oft admonish the people, and in especial women, that they make no vowes, but after long deliberation, conse nt of their husbandes, and counsell of the Priest. The church of Englād in time past made this constitution. What sawe they, that made this decre? They sawe the intollerable abuses of Images. They sawe the peryls, that might ensue, of going on pilgremage. They sawe, the superstitious difference that men made betwene image and image. Surely somwhat they sawe. The constitution is so made, that in maner it taketh away al such pilgrimages. For it so plucketh away the abuse of them, that it leaueth eyther none, or els seldome vse of them. For they that restreine making vowes, for going of pilgrimage, restreine also pilgrimage. Seing that for the most parte, it is sene, that few go on pilgremage, but vowe makers, and such as by promise bynde them selfe to go. And when, I pray you should a mans wife go on pilgremage, if she went not, before she had wel debated the matter with her selfe, and obteined the consent of her husband, being a wyse man, and were also counselled by a learned Priest so to do? When should she go

For this the common people of England thinke to be going on pilgremage, to go to som dead and notable image out of towne, that is to say far from theyr house. Now if your forefathers made this constitution, and yet thereby dyd nothing, the abuses euery daye more & more encreased, what is left for you to do? Bretherne and fathers, if ye purpose to do any thing, what should ye soner

For ther is no tyme of the yeare, in which the plowman hath not some special worke to do, as in my coūtry in Lecester shire, the plow man hath a tyme to set forth, and to assay his plough, & other tymes for other necessary workes to be done. And then they also may be lykened together for the diuersity of workes, and variety of offices that they haue to doo. For as the plowman first setteth foorth his plough, & then tylleth hys lande, & breaketh it in furrowes, & somtime rydgeth it vp agayne.

He speaketh it as though it were a care thing to finde such a one, & as though he wonld say: ther be but a few of them to finde in the world. And howe fewe of them ther be throughout this realm that geue meate to their flocke as they should do: the Uisitours can best tel. To few, to few, the nioze is the pity, & neuer so few as now. By thys then it appeareth that a prelate, or any that hath cure of soul, must diligently and subitancially worke & labour. Therefore saith Paule to Timothe: Qui episcopatum desidcrat, bic bonum opus desiderat. He that desireth to haue the offi: e of a Bishop, or a prelate, that man desireth a good woorke. Then if it be good woorke, it is worke. Ye can make but a worke of it. It is Gods worke, Gods plough, & that plough God woulde haue styl goyng. Suche then as

But curssed be he that doth the woorke of God negligently or gylefully.

Here haue I an occasiō by the way, somwhat to say vnto you, yea, for the place that I alledged vnto you before out of Jeremy the. 48. Chapter. And it was spoken of a spirituall woorke of God, a worke that was cōmaunded to be done, & it was of shedding bloud, & of destroying the Cities of Moab. for (saith he) cursed be he that keepeth backe hys swoorde from sheddyng of bloud. As Saule when he kept backe the swoord from sheddyng of bloud, at what time he was sent agaynst Amalech, was refused of God for beyng disobedient to Gods cōmaundementes, in that he spared Agag the Kyng. So that, that place of the Prophet was spoken of them that went to the destruction of the Cities of Moab, amonge the whych there was one called Nebo, whych was much reproued for wolatry, supersticion, pride, auarice, cruelty, tiranny, & for hurdnes of hart, and for these synnes was plaged of God and destroied.

For euer since the Prelates wer made Lordes & Nobles, the plough standeth, there is no worke done, the people sterue. They hauke, they hunt, they carde, they dice, they pastime in there prelacyes with galaunte gentlemen, with their daunsing minions, and with their

But there be two kindes of in closing to let or hynder both theso.Two kyndes of inclo syng. kindes of ploughyng. The one is an inclosing to let or hynder the bodily ploughyng, and the other to let or hinder the holy day ploughing, yt church ploughing.

For what man wil let go or diminish his priuate commodity, for a commune welth? and who wyl susteine any damage for the respect of a publique commodity? The other plough also no man is diligent to set forwarde, nor no man wyll herken to it.

If the Apostles myght not leaue the office of preaching to be deacons, shall one leaue it for minting? I can not tel you, butMyntyng Priestes. the saying is, that synce Priestes haue bene mynters, mony hath bene wurse then it was before. And they saye that the euilnesse of mony hath made al things dearer. And in this behalfe I must speake to England. Heare my coūtry England, as Paule sayd in his first epistle to the Cor. vi.

So England I speake it to thy shame. Is there neuer a noble man to be a Lorde President, but it muste be a prelate? Is there neuer a wyse man in the realme to be a Comptroler of the Mint? I speake it to your shame, I speake it to your shame. If there be neuer a wise man, make a Water bearer, a Tinker, a Cobler, a slaue, a page, Comptroler of the Mint. Make a meane

If there be neuer a gentilman meeteThe bringing vp of Gentlemē. nor able to be Lord president. For why are not the noble men and yong gentlemen of England, so brought vp in knowledge of god and in learning, that they may be able to execute offices in the commune weale? The King hath a great many of wardes, and I trow ther is a court of wards, why is there not a scoole for the wardes, as wel as ther is a court for theyr landes? Why are they not set in schooles, where they maye learne? Or why are they not sent to the Uniuersityes, that they may be able to serue the king when they come to age? Yf the wardes & yong gentlemen were wel brought vp in learning and in the knowledge of God, they would not whē they come to age so much gaue them selues to other vanities. And if the Nobility be well trayited in godly learning, the people would folow yt same traine. For truly, such as the noble men be, such wyl the people be.

A Byshop hath his office, a slock to teach, to loke vnto, and therefor he can not meddle wyth an other office, which alone requireth a whole man. He should therfore geue it ouer to whom it is meete, and labour in his owne busines, as Paule wryteth to the Thessalonions. Let euery man do his owne busines, & folow his calling. Let the Priest prcach, & the noble men handle the tēporal matters. Moses was a meruaslous man, a good man. Moses was a wonderful felowe, & did his duty being a maried mā, we lack such as Moses was.

Then let vs trust vpon hys onelye death, and looke for none other sacrifice propitiatory, then the same bloudye Sacrifice, the lyuely sacrifice, and not the dry Sacrifice, but a bloudye Sacrifice. For Christ hym selfe sayde: con summatum est, It is perfectly finished. I haue taken at my fathers hande the dispensation of redeemyng mankynde. I haue wrought mans redemption, and haue dispatched the matter. Why then mingle ye hym? why

                  What other seruice haue we to doo to hym? and what other sacrifice haue we to offer, but the mortification of our sleshe? What other oblacion haue wee to make, but of obedience, of good lyuyng, of good woorkes, and of helping our neyghbours? But as for our redemption, it is done already, it cannot be better. Christ hath done that thyng so well, that it can not bee amended. It can not be deuised howe to make that any better then he hath done it. But the Dyuell by the helpe of that Italian Byshop yonder, hys Chaplayne, hath laboured by al meanes that he myght, to frustrate the deathe of Christ, and the merites of hys passion. And they haue deuised for that purpose, to make vs beleue in other vayne things by hys pardons, as to haue remission of synnes, for praying on halowed beades, for drynkyng of the bakehouse bole, as a Channon of Waltam Abbeyonce told me, that when so euerThe Mōke of Waltā. they put theyr loaues of bread into the ouen, as many as dranke of the pardon bole, should haue pardon for drynkyng of it. A mad thyng to geue pardon to a bole. Then to

Euery one hath robbed some part of Christes passion and crosse, & hath mingled Christes death, and hath bene made to be propitiatory and satisfactory, and to put away sinne. Yea and Alexanders holy water yet at thys day remayneth in England, and is vsed for a remedy agaynst spirites, and to chase away Deuyls, yea and I woulde thys had bene the woorste. I woulde thys were the woorst. But wo woorth thee, O Deuyll, that hast preuayled to euacuate Christes crosse, and to mingle the Lordes Supper. These be the Italian Byshops deuises, and the Dyuel hath prycked at thys marke, to frustrate the crosse of Christ. He shot at thys marke long before Christe came, he shotte at thys prycke foure thousande yeares before Christ hanged on the Crosse, or suffered hys passion.

For the brasen Serpent, was set vp in the

                      to put men in remembraunce of Christes commyng, that lyke as they which beheld the brasen Serpent were healed of theyr bodely diseases: so they that looked spirituallye vpon Christe that was to come, in hym shoulde be saued spirituallye from the Diuel. The Serpent was set vp in memorye of Christ to come, but the Diuel founde meanes to steale awaye the memory of Christes commyng, and brought the people to woorshyp the Serpent selfe, and to sence hym, to honour him, and to offer to hym, to woorshyppe hym, and to make an Idole of hym. And this was done by the market men that I tolde you of. And the Clarke of the market dyd it for the lucre and aduauntageThe

And euen now so hath he certayn blaunchers longyng to the market, to let and stoppe the light of the Gospel, and to hynder the Kynges proceedynges in settyng foorth the woord and glory of God. And when the Kynges Maiesty wyth the aduise of hys honourable Counsayle goeth aboute to promote Gods woord, and to set an order in matters of religion, there shal not lacke blaunchers that wyl saye: As forBlaūchers Images, where as they haue bene vsed to be senced, and to haue candels offered vnto them, none be so foolysh to doo it to the stock or stone, or to the Image selfe, but it is done to God and hys honour besore the Image. And though they

                      abuse it, these blaunchers wyl be ready to whysper the Kyng in the eare, and to tel hym, that thys abuse is but a smal matter. And that the same, with al other like abuses in the church may be refourmed easely. It is but a

                      abuse (say they) and it may be easely amended. But it should not be taken in

                      at the fyrste for feare of trouble, or further inconueniences. The people wyl not beare sodayne alteracions: an insurrection may be made after

                      mutacion, whych may be to the great harme and losse of the Realme. Therfore al things shal be wel, but not out of hand, for feare of further busynes. These be the blaunchers that hitherto haue stopped the word of God, and hyndered the true settyng foorthe of the same. There be so many put offes, so many put byes, so manye

                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and considraetions of worldly wisdome. And I dout not but there were blaunchers in the olde time, to whysper in the eare of good Kynge Ezechyas, for the mayntenaunceTher haue bene blaunchers styl. of Idolatrye done to the brasen Serpent, aswell as there hath bene nowe oflate, and be now that can blaunche the abuse of Images and other lyke thynges. But good Kyng Ezechias woulde not bee so blynded, he was lyke to Apollos, feruent in spirite. He woulde geue no eare to the Blaunchers, he was not moued wyth the worldly

                     , wyth these prudent considerations, wyth these policies, he feared not insurrections of the people. He feared not least his people woulde not beare the glorye of God: but he (wythout anye of these respectes, or 
                        〈◊〉
                     , or considerations, like a good kynge for Goddes sake, and for conscience sake) by & by plucked downe the brasen serpente, and destroyed it vtterlye, and beate it to pouder. He out of hande, dyd caste downe all Images, he

                      al Idolatrie, and clerely dyd extirpate al supersticion. He woulde not heare these blaunchers and wordly wyse men but with out delaye, foloweth gods cause and destroyeth all

And good hope ther is that it shall be lykewyse here in Englande, for the kynges Maiestye is so broughte vp in knowledge, vertue, and godlynesse, that it is not to be mystrusted, but that we shal haue al thynges well, and that

                      glorye of God shall be spread abrode, throughout all partes of the realme, yf the Prelates wil diligently apply their plough and be preachers, rather then Lordes. But our blaunchers, which wyl be Lordes, and no labourers, when they are commaunded to go and be resident vpon their cures, and preache in theyr benifices, they would say.

But in the meane time the Prelates take theyr pleasures. They are Lords and no labou rers, but the Deuil is diligent at his plough. He is no vnpreaching prelate.

                  WHan man is borne for man, that one to another should be a God, and not a deuyll, an helper, no hynderer, vnto whom also the vse of the tonge is only geuen, whereby they doo both expresse and shew the affections of their mindes, there is no man which can say, I haue no nede of any man. But amonges infinite mischiefes and euilles of mans pouertie and anguish, by whiche he hath nede of other mens helpe, is the instruction of prudence or vertue and of science. For mankinde in this do precel chiefly brute beastes, because they helpe one another by mutuall communication. In learnyng good and vertuous maners, the vse of commoning is required chiefly, that men erryng, and ignoraunte shoulde be taught, for there is none which shall euer lerne of himselfe, al though he be neuer so happily borne.
                  Therfore, it shall become euery man, which do intende to liue godly, to here and learne godly bokes, to print heauenly documēts in their harts. For as euill doctrine, deuelish bokes, & filthie talke do corrupt good maners: so faithful precepts, godly bokes, chast cōmoning & honest shal edifie, & cōfirm. wherfore, intending to do good vnto al men and namely vn to suche, as erre and be ignorante, I haue gathered, writ, and brought into lighte, the famous fryday 
                        〈◊〉
                      of M. Hugh Latimer, which he preached in Lēt last past, before our most noble king Edwad the sixt, at the new palaice of westminster the third yere of his reigne. which Sermōs (most vertuous La dy) I dedicate vnto your honorable grace, nothing doubting but that you will gladly imbrace them, not only because of their excellencie, but chiefly for the profit which shal ensue thorough them vnto the ignorant. For in them are fruteful &

godly documents, directing ordinatly not only the steps, cō
                     uersation, and liuing of kings: but also of other ministers and subiectes vnder him. And let no man begreued though it be not so exactly done as he did speake it, for in very dede I am not able so to doo, to wryte word for word as he did speake, that passeth my capacitie, though I had xx. mens wittes, and no fewer handes to write with all. As it is vnpossible that a little ryuer should receiue the recourse of the mayne sea with in his brimmes, so that no water should ouer whelm the sides therof, In lyke manner is it more vnlyke my simple witte to comprehende absolutly the aboundante eloquence and learning whiche floweth most aboundantly out of godly Latimers mouth. Notwithstanding, yet had I rather with shamefastnes declare charitably, this parte of his godly documents, and counsell, then with slouthfulnes forget or kepe close folishly, that thing which may profete many.
                  who is that will not be glad to heare and beleue the doctrine of godly Latymer? whom God hathe appoynted a prophet, vnto our most noble Kynge, and vnto our Realme of England, to declare the message of the lyuing god, to 
                        〈◊〉
                      and 
                        〈◊〉
                      oute all sinnes and vice, to plant and graffe in mens hartes the plenteousnes of all spirituall blessynges in Iesus Chryste oure Lorde?
                  Moyses, Ieremias, Helias, did neuer declare the true message of God vnto theyr rulers and people, with a more sincere spirite, faythfull minde aud godly zeale, then godly Latimer dothe now in our dayes vnto our moste noble Kynge and 
                        〈◊〉
                      the whole realme. Furthermore, also Iosia receyued neuer the boke of Gods will at the handes of Helkia the hye priest, or the admonicion of Hulda that prophetesse, with a more perfect and godly feare, then oure most noble Kynge doth most faithfully, geue credite vnto the wordes of good fa ther Latimer. And I haue no doubt but all godly men will lykewise receyue gladly his godly Sermons and geue credit vnto the same. Therfore this my rude laboure of another mans swete (most vertuous ladye) I offer most humbly vnto

your, grace, moued there vnto of godly zeale, thorough the godly fame, that is disperst vniuersally of youre most Godly disposicion, and vnfained loue towardes the lyuyng, almightye, eternall God and his holy worde, practysed dayly bothe in your graces most vertuous behauour, and also godly charitie towards the edificatiō of euery mēbre graffed in Chryst Iesu, most humbly desyring your grace to accept fauourably thys my temerous enterpryse. And I your most humble and faythfull Oratour, shall praye vnto Iehouah, the God whiche is of hymself, by whom, and in whom, all thynges lyue, moue, and be, that that good work which he hath begonne in you, he may perform it vnto your last endyng, through our Lord Iesu Chiste, who preserue and kepe your grace now & euer, So be it.
               
            
            
               
                  
                     
                     
                        The argument of the fyrst Sermon.
                        IN this first Sermon is declared, & taught the godly election of a king, and a rule of godly liuing as touching his owne person. 
                              〈◊〉
                            here

                            proueth our most excelēt king Edward, to be our most lawfull king both by natiuitie, and contrey, yea, & now appointed in these our daies to deliuer vs from the daunger and captiuitie of Egipt and wicked Pharao, that is from 
                              〈◊〉
                            and ignorance and the deuelish antichrist the Pope of Rome. The forme of his godlye rule also he deuided here in this Sermon in three partes. Fyrst that he should not trust to muche vnto his owne strength and policye, but only to walke 
                              〈◊〉
                            with God and to make him his 
                              〈◊〉
                            man & chief guide. Secondarily that he liue not lassiuiously and wantonly, folowing veneriall affections, but to lyue chastly. And whē time shall require, to lead a pure lyfe, vnder the yoke of matrimony, admonishing both his grace, and al other Maiestrates to be circumspect in chosyng a wyfe, eyther for themselues or for their children, hauing this alwaies in mind, that she be, of a faithful house, godly brought vp, and of a pure lyfe? Thirdly he admonished the kinges grace, that he should not desyre gold & syluer to muche, prouing by many argumentes that that kinde of vice with the other forsaid, to be destruction not only vnto the kinges grace: but also vnto the whole realme & people, In these thinges consisteth the whole sum of this sermon.

In taking this parte of scripture (most noble audience) I play as a trowant, which when he is at schole, will chose a lesson, wherein he is perfight, because he is loth to take payne in studieng a new lesson, or els feareth stripes for his slothful nes.

                     King Dauid being in hys chyldhode, an old man, in hysiii. of the kings the fyrst chap. second childhode, for al olde men are twise children, as the Prouerbe is. Senex bis puer.

                     This king Dauid being weak of nature and impotent, in so much that whē he was couered with clothes, he could take no heate, was counsailed of hys seruauntes to take a fair young maid to nourishe him, and to kepe him warme in hys body, I suppose she was his wyfe. How be it he had no bodilye companye with her, and wel she myghte be hys wife. For though the scripture do the say. Non cognouit eam. He knewe her not, he had no carnall copulation with her, yet it sayth not: Non duxit eam vxorem. He maryed her not. Aud I cannot thinke that kyng Dauid would haue her to warme hys bosome in bed, except she had bene hys wyfe, hauing a dispensation of God to haue as manye wyues as he would. For god had dispensed with them to haue many

Kinge Dauid had a proud sonne, whose name was Adonias, a man full of ambition, desyrous of honoure, alwayes climynge, clymyng. Now, whiles the time was of hys fathers childhod, he woulde depose hys father, not

other adherentes to help him forward, worldly wise men, suche as had ben before of his fathers counsaile, great men in the worlde, and some no dout of it, came of good wyll thinking no harme, for they would not thinke, that he did it without his fathers will, hauing such greate men to set him forthe, for euery man can not haue accesse at all times to the king, to know his pleasure: well, algates he would be king. He makes a great feast, and thether he called Ioab the ringleader of his fathers armie, a worldly wise man, aIoab captain generall of

                        , Dauid suffred al thys, and let him alone, for he was in his childhod a bedred man. But see how God or dered the matter. Nathan the Prophet and Sadoc a Priest: and 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and Crethytes, and

                         the Kinges garde, they were not called to the feast.
                     These were good men, and would not walke by wayes, therfore it was folly to breake the matter to them, they were not called to counsell. Therfore Nathan whē he hard of this, he commeth to Bethsabe, Salomons mother, and sayth. Heare ye not how Adonias the sone of Ageth, raigneth king, Dauid not knowing? And he bad her put the king in mind of his oth that he sware that her sonne Salomon should be king after him, this was wise counsayle according to the prouerbe. Qui vadit plane, vadit sane.
                     
                     He that walketh in the hye plainway, walketh safely.Bethsabesueth to Dauid for Salomon. Upon this she wente and brake the matter to Dauid, and desired him to shew who should raygne after him in Hierusalem, adding that if Adonias were king, she and her son after his death should be destroyed, saying: Nos erimus peccatores. We shalbe sinners, we shalbe taken for traytors, for thoughe we ment no harme, but walked vprightly, yet because we went not the by way with hym, he beyng in authoritie wyll destroy vs. And by and by commeth in Nathā, and taketh her tale by the ende, and sheweth hym how Adonias was saluted kyng, and that he had bid to dinner the kynges seruantes, all sauyng hym and Sadoc, and Banaiah

and all his brethren the Kyngs sonnes saue Salomon. Kinge Dauid remembryng hymselfe, swore, as sure as God lyueth, Salomon my sonne shal raygne after me and by and by commaunded Nathan and Sadoc and hys garde the Cerites and Phelites, to take Salomon hys sonne and set hym vppon his mule, and anoynte hym Kyng. And so they did crying. Viuat Salomon Rex. Thus was Salomon throned, by the aduise and will of his father, and though he were a childe, yet was his will to be obeyed and fulfylled, and they ought to haue knowen his pleasure.
                     Whylse this was a doing there was suche a ioye and outcryThe ioie of the people for their new king. of the people, for theyr new kyng, and blowing of trom pettes, that Ioab and the other company beyng in theyr io lytie, and kepyng good cheare: Hearde it, and sodaynly asked what is this ado? And when they perceyued, that Salomon, by the aduise of his father was annoynted kyng, by and by there was all whisht, all theyr good chere was don, and all that were with Adonias, went away, and let hym raygne alone: if he would, and why? He walked a by way and God would not prosper it.
                     God will not worke with priuate authoritie, nor with any thing done inordinatly. When Adonias saw this thatGod is against

Here is to be noted the notable sentence, and greate mercy of kyng Salomon.
                     Let him (saith he) order him selfe lyke a quyet man, andSalamon is mercyfull. there shall not one hear fall from hys head. Sed si inuentum fuerit, malum in

for this notoryous treason, that Adonias had committed, it was a playne matter, for he suffred him selfe to be called kyng, it hung not of vehement suspition or coniecture nor sequell or consequent, yet notwithstanding Salomon for that present, forgaue him, saying I wil not forget it vtterly, but I will kepe it in suspece, I will take no aduauntage of thee at this time. This Adonias and Absolon were brethren, and came both of a straung mother, and Absolō likewise was a traytour and made an insurrection against his father. Beware therfore these mothers, and let kings take hede howe they mary, in what houses, in what

No we geueth Dauid an exhortation to Salomon, and teacheth hym the dutie of a king, and geueth him a lesson, as it foloweth at large in the boke, and he that list to reade it, may se it there at full. But what doth Adonias all this whyle? He must yet clime again, the gall of ambition was not outAdonias schrinks in the wetyng & proueth nought in the wearing. of his hart. He will now mary Abisaak the yong Queene that warmed king Dauides bosome, as I told you, & commeth me to Bethsabe, desiering her to be a meane to Salomon her sonne that he might obtayne his purpose.

Then sayd he all the eyes of Israell were cast vpon me, that is to say: all Israll consented to it, and there he lyed falslye. For Nathan, Sadoc, and other wyse men, neuer agreed to it. Here was a great enterprise of Adonias: he will be climbing still. Well Bethsabe went at his request to her sonne Salomon, and asked aboune, and be graunted her what soeuer she did aske. Notwithstanding he brake his promis afterward & that rightwell,When promises may not be performed. for all promisses are not to be kept, specially if they be againste the worde of God.

As for the Phelethites we doo not read that they were punished. Mary, Semey transgressed his Iniunction: for he kept not his house, but went out, of Hierusalē to seke two seruaūts of his, that had run from him: and when it came to Salomons eare, it cost him his lyfe.

Well, it chaunced that the lord Protectour and he fell oute, and the Byshop would beare

nothing at all with him, but played me the Satrapa, so that the Regent of Fraunce was fayne to be sent for, from beyond the seas, to set them at one, and to go betwene them. For the Bishop was as able and readye to buccle with the Lorde Protectoure, as he was with hym.
                     Was not this a good prelate? he should haue ben at home a preaching in hys Dioces in a waniant. This Protector was so noble and Godly a man, that he was called of eueryThe good duke Humfrey. man the good Duke Humfrey. He kept such a house, as ne uer was kept since in England, without any enhaunsyng of rentes. I warrant you, or any suche matter.

                     But now to returne to my text, and to make further re hearsall of the same, the matter beginneth thus. Et post quā sederit Rex. And when the king is set in the seat of his kingdom,The office of a king newly chosen. what shall he do? shall he daunce, and dally? banket? hauke and hunte? No forsoth syr. For as God set an order in the kinges stable as I tolde you in my laste Sermon, so will he appoint what pastime a king shal haue.
                     What must he doo then? He must be a student. He muste write Gods booke him selfe. Not thinking because he is a kyng, he hath licence to doo what he will, as these worldly flatterers are wont to say. Yea, trouble not your self sir, ye may hauke and hunt, & take youre pleasure.

Where shall he haue a copie of this boke? of the Leuites. And why? Because it shall be a true copie, not falsifyed. Moyses left the boke in an olde chest, and the

                         had it in kepyng. And because there should be no errour, no addition, nor taking away from it, he biddeth him fetche the copy of the Leuites. And was not here a greate miracle of God, how this boke was preserued? It had lain hid many yeares and the Iewes knew not of it. Therfore at length when they had found it and knew it: they lamented for theyr ignoraunce, that had so long bene withoute it, and rent their clothes, repenting theyr vnfaythfulnesse. And the holy bible Gods boke, that we haue among vs, itGods booke hath, ben preser ued hitherto by a wonderful mi racle. hath ben preserued hytherto by wonderfull miracle of god though the kepers of it were neuer so malitious. Firste euer syth the bishop of Rome was firste in authoritie, they haue gone aboute to destroye it, but God worketh wonder fully, he hath preserued it mauger theyr beartes, and yet ar we vnthankfull that we can not consider it. I wil tell you, what a bishop of this realme sayde once to me, he sent for me and meruayled that I would not consent to such traditions, as were then set out. And I aunswered him, that I woulde be ruled by Gods boke, and rather then I woulde dissent one iote frō it, I would be torne with wild horsses.

But God knoweth,A bishop that asked whether the people might not be ordred withoutè scriptures. full ill yet would they haue ordered them. For seyng that hauing it, they haue deceyued vs, in what case should we haue ben now without it? But thankes be to God, that by so wonderfull a myracle hath preserued the boke still.

He shall reade in it not once a yeare. for a time, or for his recreation, whē he is weary of haukyng or hunting, but cunctis diebus vita suae All the daies of his life. Where ar those worldlyngs now? These bledder puffed vp wyly men? Wo worth them that euer they were about any king. But how shal he read this boke, as the Homilies are read? Some call them homlies,How homely they handle the the godlye Homylies. and in dede so they may be well called, for they are homely handled. For though the priest reade them neuer so well, yet if the parish like them not, there is suche talking and babling in the churche, that nothing can be heard: Aud yf the parysh be good, and the priest nought, he will so hacke it, and chop it, that it were as good for them to be without it, for any word that shalbe vnderstand.

                     It is in the text, that a king ought to feare God, he shall haue the dread of God before his eies, worke not by world ly policy, for worldly policy feareth not God.

                     Therfore I will furnish the text now with an history or two, and then I will leaue you to God. Ye haue hearde how a king ought to passe the time. He must read the boke of God, and it is not inongh for him to reade, but he must be acquanted with all scripture, he must study, and he must pray: And how shall he do both these.
                     He maye learne at Salomon, God spake vnto Salomon,iii. of king. iii. when he was made a kyng, and badde hym aske ofii. of Chronicles. i. b hym what he woulde, and he shoulde haue it. Make thy petition, sayde God, and thou shalte obtayne. Nowe marke Salomons prayer: Domine, o Domine deus, sayde he: O LordSalomon is a president of pra yer for kinges. God, it is thou that hast caused me to raygne, and haste set me in my fathers seate, for thou God onlye doest make kynges. Thus shoulde kyngs prayse God, and thanke god as Salomon dyd. But what was his petition? Lorde, sayd he: Da mihi cor docile. He asked a docyble heart, a wise hart,Salomon asketh wisdome. and wysedome to goo in, and to goo oute, that is to begyn all myne affayres well, and to bring them to good effect & purpose, that I may learne to guide and gouerne my people. When he hadde made hys petition, it pleased god wel that Salomon asked wisdom, & neither rytchesse nor long life, & therfore god made him this answer. Because yu haste chosen wisdō aboue al things. I wil geue thee it, and thou

                         sythe. And thoughe he dyd not aske ritchesse, yet God gaue hym both richesse and honour, more then euer anye of hys auncetors had. So your grace must learn how to do, of Sa lomon, Ye must make your petition, now study, now pray. They muste be yoked together, and thys is called pastyme with good company.
                     Now when God had geuen Salomon wisdome, he sent him by and by occasyon to occupye his wit. For God gaue neuer a gifte, but he sent occasyon at one time or an other to shew it to Gods glory. As if he sente richesse, he sendethGod

He that loueth his chylde better then me, is not worthye to be my disciple. I cannot see how ye shal stand before God at the later daye, when thys sentence shal be layd against you.
                     But to returne to my purpose, there wer two pore women came before Salomon to complaine.

Upon that they came bothe before Salomon to haue the matter iudged, whose the childe was. And the one sayd: it is my chylde. Naye sayeth the other, it is mine. So there was yea and naye betwene them, and they healde vp the matter with skoldynge after a womanlike fashion. At the lengthe Salomon repeated theyr tale as a good iudge ought to do, and said to the one woman. Thou sayest ye child is thyne, yea sayde she. And thou sayest, it is thine to the other. Well, fetche me a swearde, sayde he. For there was no waye nowe to trye, whyche was the true mother, but by naturall inclination. And so he sayde to one of hys seruaunts. Fetch me a sweard and deuyde the childe betwene

them. When the mother of the childe that accused thother hearde him saye so. Naye for Goddes sake sayde she, lette her haue the whole childe, and kyll it not. Naye, quod the other, neyther thine nor mine, bet let it be deuided. Then sayde Salomon. Geue this woman the childe, this is the mother of the childe. What come of this? Audiuit omnes Israel. When all Israell heard of thys iudgement, they feared the king. It is wisdome and godly knowledge that cauWisdome causeth a kynge to be fcared. seth a king to be feared. One word note here for gods sake and I wil trouble you no longer. Would Salomon being so noble a king hear two poore women? They were pore, for as the scripture saithe. They were together alone in a house, they had not so much as one seruant betwene them bothe. Woulde kynge Salomon, I saye, hear them in hys owne person? Yea forsothe.

For some miracle workers shall go to the deuill. I will tell you what I remembred yesternight in my bed. A meruaylous tale to perceyue, howe inscrutable a mans hart is. I was once at Oxford (for I had occasyon to come that way, when I was in my office) theyWhat he sawe and hard once at

sone cost a man his lyfe for aworde speaking.
                     I cannot tell what the matter was, but the iudge set it so out that the man was condemned. The. xii. men came in, and said giltye, and vpon that, he was iudged to be hanged, drawen, & quartred. When the rope was about his necke, no man could perswade him that he was in any faulte, and stode there a great while in the protestation of his innocen cy. They hanged him and cut him downe somwhat to soneNote this ye wicked that wil not

                        sessed his faulte and said he was giltye. O a wonderfull example: it may well be sayd: Prauum cor hominis et inscrutabile A crabbed peace of work and vnsercheable. I wil leue here, for I think you know what I meane well inough. I shall not nede to applie this example any further. As I began euer with this saying. Quoecunque scripta sunt, like a trouant & so I haue a commune place to the ende, if my memory fayle me, Beati qui audiunt verbum dei et custodiunt illud, Blessed be they that heare the word of God, & kepe it. It must be kepte in memorie, in liuing, & in our cōuersation. And if we so do, we shal come to ye blessednes, which god prepared for vs tho row hys son Iesu Christ, to the which he bring vs al.

                     ¶ The fourth Sermon of Master Hugh Latimer whiche he preached before Kyng Edwarde, the. xxix. day of Marche.

                           〈◊〉
                         parable is this: There was a certain iudge in a citie, that feared neyther God nor mā. And in the same citye there was a widow, that required iustice at his hands: but he would not heare her, but put her of, and delayed the matter: In processe the Iudge seing her importunitie, said, though I feare neither God nor man, yet for the importunitie of the woman, I wil heare her, least she raile vpō me,

& molest me with exclamations, & oute cries I will heare her matter. I will make an end of it. Our Sauiour 
                           〈◊〉
                         added more vnto this and sayde. Audite quid iudex dicat, &c. Hear you said Christ, what the wicked iudge sayd. And shal not God reuenge his elect, that crye vpon him day & night? Although he tary & differre them, I say vnto you, he wil reuenge them, & that shortly. But when the son of man shall come, shall he finde faith in the earth?
                     That I may haue grace so to open the remnaunte of this parable, that it may be to the glory of God, and edifying of youre soules, I shal desier you to praye. In the which praier &c. I shewed you the last daye (most honourable Audience) the cause why our Sauiour Christ, rather vsed the example of a wicked Judge thē of a good.

                         Judges, so that he might borow an example among them well inough. For there was much scarcitie of good iudges. I did excuse the widdowe also, for comming to the Judge against her aduersarye, because she did it not of malice: she did it not for appetite of vengeance.A

As for my quondamship I thank God that he gaue me the grace to come by it, by so honest a meanes as I did.

It is he that must geue the encrease, and yet preaching is necessarye. For take away preaching, and take a way saluation. I tould you of Scala coeli and I made it a preaching matter, not a massyng matter. Christ is the preacher of all preachers, the patrone and the exemplar, that al preachers ought to folow.

He was Bonus Pastor. A good shepeheard. He was one of them, qui bene presunt that discharged his cure, and yet he thought that ther might be a farther thing in hym selfe, then he sawe in hym selfe. And therfore he sayd: The Lorde shal iudge me. I wyll stand onely to the Iudgement of the Lord. For loke whom he iudges to be good, he is sure he is safe, he is cocke sure.

I went about to kepe you from arrogant iudgement. This is no good argument my frendes. A man semeth not to feare death, ther fore hys cause is good. This is a deceauable argument. He went to his death boldly, Ergo he standeth in a iust quarell.

The one denied the matter, and the tother confessedIt is hard to Iudge a mans hart it, there is no iudging of such matters. I haue heard much wickednes of thys man, and I thought oft, Iesu, what wil worth, what wyl be the end of thys man.

Moreouer, God is naturally merciful. The Judge was cruel, and yet he healped the wyddowe, much more then wil God helpe vs at our neede. He sayth by the oppressed: Cum ipso sum in tribulatione. I am with him in his trouble. His tribulation is myne. I am touched with this trouble. If yt Judge thē being a cruell manne hearde the wyddow, muche more GOD wil healpe vs, beyng touched wyth our affliction. Furthermore, thys Judge gaue the wyddowe no commandement to come

He that spake the one, spake the other, and what soeuer he be that is in trouble, and calleth not vpon God, breaketh hys commaundement. Take heede therfore, the Judge dyd not promise the wyddow helpe, God promised vs helpe, & wyl he not perfourme it? He wyl, he wil. The Judge (J say) did not promise the widdow help, God wil geue vs both hearyng & helpyng. He hath promised it vs with a double othe, Amen, amen, sayth he, verely, verely, he doubles it.

When the helpe is most nedeful, then he wyl come and not tary. He knoweth when it shal be best for vs to haue helpe, though he tarye, he wyl come at the last.

AsOne solucion for al. the Supper of the Lord is the Sacrament of an other thyng, it is a commemoration of hys death which suffered once for vs, and because it is a signe of Christes offering vp, therefore he beares the name therof. And thys Sacrifice a woman cā offer as wel as a man.

And whosoeuer cōmeth asking the father remedy in hys necessity for Christes sake, he offereth vp as acceptable a sacrisice as any by shoppe can do. And so to make an ende. Thys must be done wyth a constaunt faythe, and a sure confidence in Christe. Faythe fayeth, fayeth, We are vndone for lacke of fayeth. Christ namethFayth is altogether. Fayth here, Faythe is altogether. When the sonne of man shall come, shall he synde Fayth on the earthe? Why speaketh he so muche of Fayth? because it is harde to fynde a true faythe. He speaketh not of a politicall faythe, a faythe set vp for a time, but a constant a permanent, a durable faith as durable as Gods word. He came many times. Fyrst in the tyme of Noe, when he preached, but he found lytle fayth. He came also when Let preached, when he destroyed Sodoms Gomora, but he found no fayth.

Now as the Gentleman Usher goeth before her, so she hath a trayne that commeth behinde her, and yet thoughe they come behinde, they be al of Faythes companye, they are all with her, as Christe when he counter faited a State goyng to Hierusalem, some went before him, and some after, yet all were of hys company.

And yet many there be that boast them selues that they haue Fayth, and that when Christ shall come, they shall do well inough. Nay, nay, these that be faythful shal be so fewe, that Christs shal scarce see them. Manye there bee that runneth (saythe Saynt Paule,) but there is but one that receyueth the rewarde. It shall be wyth the multitude when Christe shall come, as it was in the tyme of Noe, and as it was in the tyme of Lot.
                     In the tyme of Noe, they were eatyng and drynkyng, buyldyng and plantyng, and sodaynely the water came vppon them, and drowned them. In the tyme of Lot also, they were eatyng and drynckyng. &c. And sodaynlye the

Oh, I wold ther wer no more bearers of other mens syns, then this good father Samuel was. I heard of late of a notable boodshed. Audio saith S. Paul, & so do I. I know it not, but I heare of it. Ther was a searcher in London, whych executing his office, displeased a marchaunt man, in so much, that when he was doing his office, they wer at words, the mar chant man threatned him, the searcher said, the king shuld not lose his custome. The marchant goes me home & sharpes hys woodknife, & comes againe & knockes him on the head & kyls hym. They that tolde me the tale, saye it is wyncked at, they looke thorow their fingers & wil not se it. Whether it be taken vp with a pardon or no, I cānot tel, but this I am sure, & if ye beare with such matters, the diuel shal beare you away to hel. Bloodshed & murder would haue no bearing.

But he did it of a pride, of an elation of mynde, not according to Gods ordinaunce, but as hauing a trust in yt nūber of his men, this offended God. Lykewyse the Iewes asked a king, & therwith they offended not God, but they asked him 
                           〈◊〉
                         such circumstaunces, that God was offended with them. It is no smal fault to put a iust man out ofhis office, & to depose

                         vnworthely. To chuse a kyng contrarying the ordinaunce of God, is a casting a way of God, & not of a kyng.

                         dout not, but the title of a king is a lawful thing, is a lawfull tytle, as ofother Magistrates. Onely let the kings take hede yt they do as it becōmeth kinges to do, that they do their office wel. It is a great thinge, a chargeable thing. Let them beware yt they do not communicare peccatis alienis, that they beare not wyth o. ther mcns fautes, for they shal geue a strait account for al that perisheth thorow their negligence. We perceiue now what thys text meaneth. It is written in the last of Iudicum: In diebus illis non erat rex in Israel, In those daies there was no kyng in Israel, euery man did that which semed right in hys owne eyes. Men wer then allowed to do what they wold. When mē may be alowed to do what they wyl, then it is good to haue no king at al.

                           〈◊〉
                        , and lyued wickedly, and by that meanes, brought both theyr father, and themselues to deposition. And how the people did offende God in asking a kyng in sather Samuels tyme. And how father Samuel was put from his office, who deserued it not. I opened to you also, how father Samuel cleares hym selfe, that he knewe not the fautes of hys sonnes: he was no bearer with hys sonnes, he was sory for it, when he heard it: but he would not beare with them in their wickednes, Filii mei vobiscum sunt, my sonnes are with you saith he. Do wt them according to their desertes, I wil not maintain them, nor beare with them. After that he cleares himself at the kin ges feete, that the people 
                           〈◊〉
                         nothing to burthen hym wyth all, neyther money, nor money worth. In treating of yt part, I chaunced to shewe you, what I hearde of a man that was slayne, and I heare say it was not well taken. Forsoth I entende not to empayre any mans estimation or honesty, & they that enforce it to that, enforce it not to my meaning. I sayd I heard, but of such a thynge, and toke occasion by that, that I heard, to speake against yt thyng, that I knew to be naught that no man should beare with any man to yt maintenance of volūtary and prepensed murder. And I heare say synce, the man was other wise an honest man, and they that spake for him, are honest men. I am 
                           〈◊〉

It is wō becfull that the city of London doth suffer such whoredome vnpunished. God hath suffred long of his great lenitie, mercye, and benignitie, but he will punish sharply at the length, if we do not repent.

Rather then ye shold not come at al. I would haue you come of curiositie, as S. Augustine came to heare S. Ambrose. When S. Augustine came to Millane, (he telles the story himself, in the ende of his boke of confessions) he was very desirous to heare S. Ambrose, not for any loue he had to the doctrine ye he taught but to here his eloquēce, whether it was so great, as yt

Am brose caught him on his hoke, and conuerted him so, that he became of a Maniche, and of a Platonist a good christen, a defender of Christes religion, and of the faith afterward. So I wold haue you to come to sermons: it is declared in many

Here commeth in the supremacye of the Bishop of Rome. When our Sauiour Christ had made an ende of his Sermon, and had fed their soules, he prouided for theyr bodies. Fyrst he beganne with the soule. Christes worde is the foode of it. Now he goeth to the bodye, he hathe charge of them both: we must commit the fedyng of the bodye and of the soule to him. Wel, he saith to Peter, duc in alChrist pro uides for the body as vvell as for the soule. tum, Launche into the depth, put forth thy boate farther into the depe of the water: Lose your nettes, nowe fyshe. As who should say, your soules are now fedde, I haue taughte you my doctrine, now I wyl confirme it with a myracle. Lo sir here is

A goodly argument, I wene it be a sillogismus, in quē terra pontus, I wil make a like argumēt: Our Sauiour Christ said to Iudas when he was about to betray him, quod facis fac citiꝰ, Now whē he spake to PeterA faintand a feble argument. there were none of his disciples by, 
                           〈◊〉

when he spake to Iudas they were all present. Wel he said vnto him, quodfacis sac citius, Spede thy busines, that thou hast in thy head, do it. He gaue him here a secret monition, yt he knew what he intēded, if Iudas had had grace to haue ta ken it and repented. He spake in the singuler number to himA good groūd for the colledge of cardinals. ergo he gaue him som preeminence.

                           〈◊〉
                        . Here is as good a ground for the Colledge of Cardinals, as the other is for yt supremicie of yt Bishop of Rome. Our Sauiour Christ (say they) spake onely to Peter for preeminence, because he was chief of the Apostelles, and you can shew none other cause, ergo this is the cause why he spake to him in the synguler number. I dare saye there is

O how happy are we, that it hath plesed almigh ty God to vouchsafe, that his sonne shuld sweat bloud for the redeming of our synnes, and again how vnhappy are we, if we wil not take it thankfully, that was redemed so painfully.

God wyll haue all men to be saued, he exceptes not the English men here, nor yet expresly nameth them, and yet I am as sure, that thys Realme of Englande, by this gathering, is allowed to hear Gods word, as though Christ had sayed a thousand times, go preach to Englysh men. I wyl that English men be saued. Because this arti cle of his descending into hel, cannot be gathered so direct ly, so necessarily, so formally they do vtterly deny it. This article hath scriptures two or thre inough for quiet minds as for curiouse braines, nothinge can content them.

MyAn argumente that Goddes word is abrode entente is not to entreate of this matter at this time. I trust the people wil not be caryed awaye with these newe arrogant spirites, I dout not, but good preachers will labour against them. But now I wil say a word, and herein I protest first of al not arrogantly to determin, and define it, I wil contend wyth no man for it, I wil not haue it be preiudice to any body, but I offer it vnto you to consider & way it. There be some great clarkes that take my parte. and I perceiue not what euill canne come of it, in sayinge,Bear with father Latymer in this place. that our sauiour Christ did not only, in soule descend into hel, but also that he suffered in hel such paines, as the dam ned spirites did suffer there. Surelye, I beleue verelye for my part, that he suffered the pains of hel proporcionably, as it correspondes and answers to the whole synne of the world. He wold not suffer only bodelye in the garden, andFire, gnashing of teethe, the worme of conscience, are termes, vttrynge to vs the pains of hel. vpon the crosse, but also in hys soul, when it was from the body, which was a paine due for our sinne. Some wryte so and I canne beleue it that he suffered in the verye place, and I cannot tell what it is, cal it what ye wil, euen in the skalding house, in the vgsomnesse of the place, in the presence of the place, such pain as our capacity can not attain vnto, it is somwhat declared vnto vs, when we vtter it by these effectes, by fyre, by gnashynge of teth, by the worme that gnaweth on the conscience. What so euer the pain is, it is a great pain that he suffered for vs.

I see no inconuenience to saye, that Christ suffered in soule in hell. I singularly commende the exceding great charitie of christ, that for our sakes would suffer in hel in his soule. It settes oute the vnspeakeable hatred that God hathe to sinne. I perceyue not that it doth derogate any thing from the dignitie of Christes death, as in the garden, whē he suffered, it derogates nothing from that he suffred on the crosThe

                  ¶ A Sermon of Master Latimer, preached at Stamforde the. ix. day of October. Anno. M. CCCCCL.
                  
                     
                        Reddite ergo quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, et quaesunt dei, deo.
                        Geue that that is Cesars to Cesar, and that that is Gods to God.
                     
                  
                  THys doctrine is greuous, heuy, and irkesom to couetous hartes, rebellious and seditious heartes. Geue, geue they cā not awaye with it, it cannot sticke in their mindes, nor settle in their stomakes: they would rather be taking, scraping, and catching, then geuing.
                  But godly persons will well accept and take it, for it is to them a greate pleasure, Joye and comforte. For the better vnderstanding of this place, ye shall vnderstande, ChristeChrist came not to deliuer from ciuil 
                           〈◊〉
                        . came to bring vs out of bondage and to set vs at libertye: not from ciuill burthen, as from obaying the magistrates, from payng taxe and tribute, but from a greater burthen, and a more greuouser burthen, the burthen of sin, the burthen not of the body but of the soule, to make vs free from it, and to redeme vs from the curse and malediction of the lawe, vnto the honourable state of the children of God.
                  But as for the ciuill burthens, he delyuered vs not from them, but rather commaunded vs to pay them: geue, geue, sayth he to Cesar obedience, tribute, and all thinges dewe to Cesar. For the vnderstanding of this text, it shall bee nedefull to consider the circumstance going before: whiche thing dewly considered, geueth a great lighte to all places of the scripture: who spake these wordes, to whom they were spoken, vpon what occasyon, and afore whom.
                  Therfore I will take the whole fragemente and shred, taken out of goddes 
                        〈◊〉

Then went the Pharisies and toke a counsel, Luke hath Obseruantes, marking, spying, looking, tooting, watching: like suttel, crafty & sleightie felowes they toke a councel & sent to him their disciples, which shoulde fain thē selues iust mē, godly men, glad to learne his doctrine. AndNone suche

                         as these with them Herodes seruaunts, to trap him in his words: & they sayd to him: M. we know that thou arte a true man, & teachest the way of god, in veritate, truly, & carest for no mā.

For thou regardest not the personage of man. Tel vs ther fore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawefull to geue Cesar tribute mony or no? This was their question that they wold haue

                      to this they would haue caught him by the fote. But Iesus cognita malitia

                      nes, he sayd to them: hipocrits why do ye tempt me? Shew me a piece of the tribute mony. And they brought him a peny. And he sayd to them: whose image is this, and the writing? They aunswered: Cesars, He sayd to 
                        〈◊〉

                      that that belongeth to Cesar, and to god that that is goddes.
                  Thus ye may perceiue, it was our sauioure Christe that spake these wordes, and they were spoken vnto the Phari seis that tempted him. But they be a doctrine vnto vs that are 
                        〈◊〉
                      disciples. For whose wordes should we delite to heare and learne, but the wordes and doctrine of our sa uiour christ? And that I may at this time so declare them, as may be for gods glory, your edifying, and my discharge, I pray you all to helpe me with your prayers.
                  In the whiche prayer. &c. For the vniuersall churche of christ thorow the whole world. &c. For the preseruation of our Soueraigne Lord king Edward the. vi. sole supreame head vnder God and christ of the churches of England and of Ireland. &c. Secondly for the kings most honorable

Praye therfore that we may haue grace to die in the same sayth of Christe as they did, and at the latter daye be raysed with

                      vs saye the Lords prayer. Tunc abeuntes. Tunc, It hangeth ou a text before. Christe told them a similitude that the kingdō of heauē is lyke to a king that made a bridale to his senne, he maryed his sonne, and sent his seruaunts out to bid hys gestes. Well they would not come although he had made great preparing and muche cost for them: ambicion, couetousnes, and crueltie woulde not let them come. Then he sent his warriours and destroyed them: and again sente other seruauntes to bidde gestes to his bridall, hande ouer head come who would. They did his bidding, & the 
                        〈◊〉
                      was full of gestes. The king now would vew his 
                        〈◊〉
                     : & fynding there one not cladde in mariyng garmentes, he asked him: frend howe camest thou here, not hauing a mariage garment? And commaunded to bind him hand & fote, & cast him into vtter darknes: there was wayling & grinding of teth. For many 
                        〈◊〉
                      called and few be chosen. Now Christ expoundeth this. The kingdome of heauen is preaching of the Gospell. This mariage is the ioyning of Christe & hys churche, which was begonne by Christ heare in earth, and shall continue to the ende of the world. The bidders of hys

                        . gestes are preachers, but here are so many lettes and hinderances: couetis is a let, ambicion is a let, crueltie is the gretest let. For they bet his seruaunts, brake theyr heades, yea 
                        〈◊〉
                      them, which 
                        〈◊〉
                      them to this bridall. With this the king was angry, and sent his men of warre to destroy those vnthankefull people. Was he not angrye with couetousnes and with ambition? Yes he is angrye with couetous men, with ambitious men: But most of all with cruel tie. This is an angre aboue commune anger, when men be not only 
                        〈◊〉
                     , but also adde crueltie to persecute the preachers, that commeth to call vs to this mariage.
                  This toucheth God so nigh, that he sayeth. Qui vos audit me audit. This crueltie the king would not leaue vnpunished, but sent forth his men of warre. They are called his mē of warre, his men, his men, for warres come at his commaun

dement. Titus and 
                        〈◊〉
                      sent of God to punish those couetous Jewes, ambicious Jewes, cruell Jewes yt wolde not credit Christ, nor beleue the preaching of saluation.
                  Now in warre, what 
                        〈◊〉
                      so euer get the victorye, that isThe victory 
                           〈◊〉
                         Gods. Gods parte, that is Gods host. Nabuchodonosor was an euill man, a wicked man, yet was he sent of God to punish the stubburne and couetous Jewes for their ambicion, and crueltie, and forsaking gods most holy word: And he is called in scripture Gods seruaunt. It is no good argumente. He hath the victory, Ergo he is a good man. But this is a good argument. He hathe the victory, Ergo God was on his side, and by him punished the contrary parte. The preachers called good and bad. They can doo no more but call, God is he that must bringe in, God must open the hartes, as it is in the Actes of the Apostles. When Paule preached to the women, there was a silke woman Cuius cor deus aperu it, whose hart God opened. None could open it but God. Paule could but only preache, God must work, God must doo the thing in wardly. But good and bad came. Therfore the preaching is likned to a Fishers net, that taketh goodThe 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the net. fish and bad, and draweth all to the shoare. In the whole multitude that professe the Gospel, al be not good, all cannot away with the mortifying of theyr flesh, they wil with good will beare the name of Christians, of gospellers, but to do the dedes they grudge they repine, they cā not 
                        〈◊〉
                      with it. A monge the Apostles, all were not honest, naye, one was a deuil, So among so great number of gospellersDiuers 
                           〈◊〉
                         of Gospellers. some are carde gospellers, som are dise gospellers, som pot gospellers, all are not good, al seke not amendment of life. Then commeth the king to see his gestes. And findeth one not hauing the mariage garment, and sayth to him: Frēde how camest thou hither, and hast not the mariage garmēt? Fayth is the mariage garmente, not a fayned fayth withoutThe 
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . good liuing, but faythe that worketh by loue. He was blamed because he professed one thing, and was in dede another. Why did he not blame the preachers? There was no faulte in them, they did theyr deuties, they had no further commaundemente but to call them to the mariage.
                  The garment he should haue prouided hym selfe.

Therefore he quarrelleth not with the preachers: what both this felowe here? Why suffered ye him to enter? &c. for theyr commission extended no further but only to call him. Many are greued that there is so

For there was no quarrel with the preachers, but he was cast in prison, wher was weping and wailing, and grinding of teeth: these were his delicates. Multi sunt vocati, Many are called, but few ar chosen. To this parable now

and so mainteyne their tradicions set asyde the commaundementes of God, refused Christe, and his word. S. Luke hath obseruantes obseruauntes, that is watchers, toters, spies, muche like the obseruaunte fryers, the barefote fryers, that were here, whiche in dede were the Bishop ofThe pops

                  YElde to Ceasar, that belongeth to Ceasar and to God, that belongeth to God, ye may perceiue by that we haue sayde, who spake these wordes, and vpon what occa syon they were spoken. Oure sauyoure Christ spake them to the tempting Pharises, to the craftye and subtile holowe harted Pharises, willinge them to knowe their duetye by their own confession, and to geue to Ceasar his dutye, and to God his dutye. Our sauioure Christe spake them. If he spake them, we oughte to regarde them. Regarde them I say and make muche of them, for thoughe they were then spoken to them, yet in them they were spoken to all the world, I vse to make a rehearsall of that I spake before, but because the time is shorte, I will omit it. The seruyce

These words be wordes of great importaunce, and would wel be considered: for he that doth this, receiueth greate benefites by it, but he that doth it not incurreth great dammage and dan ger.

When he was come vp into Ierusalē, and had driuen out the biers and sellers in the temple. The Archpharises, prouincials and Abbots phariseis, came stoutlye to him as he was preaching in the Temple, and said to him: Qua authoritate ista facis? aut quis dedit tibi istam aut horitatem? By what authority dost thou these things? who hath geuē thee this authority? We haue the rule of the people of god we haue geuen thee no such authority. A wōderous thing, Christ had testimonye of his father. This is my beloued sonne hear him. Ihon had born him witnesse, sayinge.

                  These Arch Pharises thought nothing might be done, or taughte withoute their license, nor otherwise, but as they pleased to interpreat. They were like our religion & clergy, that thought nothing mought be taughte, but as they pleased. They wold pay no tribute, taxe nor tribute. They had their Immunities, priueledges and graunts from the Romain bishop. And to maintain this, they alledged many scriptures as thus, Nolite tarigere Christos meos, whiche is touch not mine annoynted or consecrated people, whyche wordes the Lord spake by the Israelites in Egipte, warning king Pharao to leaue and cease from persecutyng yt Israelites, & it maketh as much for our cleargyes immunity,A good profe. and proueth it as wel, as if a man alledged, Quem ter ra pontus to proue that an Ape hath a tail. Well, they answered. Cesaris, Lesars, they confessed it was Lesars mony, and Lesars image and wrytinge vpon it: heare Christe compelled them to make āswer vnto their owne question. And if enuy should arise, to take it them self. For they con fessed it to be Ceasars. Then saide he. Geue to Lesar that which is Ceasars, and to God that is due to God. Thys answer of Christ I woulde haue you all to learne: geue to your Ceaser to your king, to our most noble king EdwardGeue to our Ceasar. our Ceasar, our king and magistrate appoynted, and geuen to vs of God, geue to him that whiche is due to hym. Thys is a commaundemente of God, as are these: Thou shalt not murther, thou shalt not steal, nor beare fals witnesse against thy neighbors. And as thou art bound vpon pearil of thy soule to obey the other, so vpon pearill of thy soule thou art bound to obey and kepe this. Loke wel vponGeue, is an he uy worde to some. it, for it is vppon pearill of thy soule. date, geue, geue, a heauy word to a couetous hart, to a rebellious harte, they would not hear Reddite or date, pay or geue, but take, catch kepe fast. We are al bound to liue in obedyence vnto oure king, vnder his iust and rightwise lawes and commaundementes. Christe came in dede to deliuer vs from burthens and bondage, but that was not from ciuill and polityke lawes and obedience.

He came to deliuer vs from the greatest bondage that can be, from sinne and damnation. The heauiest burthen thatSinne is the 
                           〈◊◊〉
                        . can be, is synne, and in comparison of it, al other burthens are but light and easy matters to beare. Therfore Christe came to deliuer vs from that, and gaue his body to be torn vpon the crosse for that. Neither could any work or lawe, or sacrifice redeme vs from that, but Christ onlye. I neuer preached in Lincolne shire afore, nor came here a fore, saue once when I went to take orders at Lincoln, which was a good while a go, therfore I can not say much of Lyncolne shire, for I know it not, but I dare saye, if Lincoln shire beLincoln shire. as other places that I know, this text condemneth a great many of Lincolne shyre, and driueth them down to hel for breakinge of this commaundement: Geue to Ceasar that whiche is due to Ceaser, and to God that whiche is due to god. The office of a magistrate is grounded vpon Goddes word, and is plainly described of S. Paule, wrytinge vnto the Romaines, where he sheweth that all soules, that is to say, all men ought to obey the magistrates, for they are or dained of God, and to resist them, is to resist agaynst God. For he is Gods minister ordained to punishe the wycked and to maintaine the good. Wherfore we ought to pay to him tribute, custome, Taxes and other thinges that he requireth vpon vs, as Christ sayeth here, Reddite geue to Cesar. How much we shuld geue, he defineth not, but leaueth it to Ceasars offycers to determine, and to his counsell to appoynt. Christ was not the Emperoures treasurer, therforeChriste was not Lord treasurer. he medled not wyth that poynt, but left it the treasurer to define and determine. He went about another vocation, to preache vnto the people their duetye, and to obey theyr Princes, Kinges, Emperoures and magistrates, and to bid them geue that the kynge requireth of them, not to appoynt a kyng what he shal require of them. It is meete for euery man to kepe hys owne vocation, and diligentlye walke in it, and with faithfulnesse to study to be occupyed in that God hathe called him vnto, and not to be busye in that God hathe not called hym vnto. Therefore sayeth Christe: geue to Ceasar, but he appoynteth not howe muche, for that shoulde his treasurer knowe, and shoulde

warne him of it, when he hath enough, that the people be not oppressed wyth vnnecessarye burthens, nor that the kynges treasures be to seke, when they shoulde be occupyed. The kynge muste haue his treasures afore hande, what chaunce so euer come soddenly. It is no reason when theThe treasurers duety. kynge should occupy his treasure in maintenaunce of a cō mon wealthe, in defence of a countrye, in maintaininge of his warres, that then his monye should be in thy purse to seke and vngathered. Nay he must haue it in a redinesse, at hand, that it be not to seke. And he must haue as muche as is necessary for him. For so much is due to a king as is necessary, and so much may he require by the law of God, and take of his commons is as necessarye. And that muste not

And as he that taketh my tippet or my cloke doth me wrong and is a thefe: so he that doth not pay to the king that is his due, without fraude or guil, doth the king wrong, and is in peril of his soul for so doing.

lechery vsed in England as there is at this day, & maintained. It is made but a laughynge matter, and a trifle, and it is a sad matter and an earnest matter. For leacherye is a great synne, Sodom and Gomore was destroyed for it. And it was one of the syns raygning in Niniue, for which it should haue bene destroyed. But thinke you yt lechery was alone? No no couetousnes was ioyned with it. Couetousnes foloweth lecheOne synne wayteth vp on another ry, and commonly they go together.

                     : when I was appoynted to preache here, I was newe come out of a sicknes, wherof I looked to haue dyed, and weake I was. Yet neuertheles when I was appointed vnto it, I tooke it vpon me, how be it I repented afterward that I had done. I was displeased wyth my selfe, I was teasty as Jonas was when he should go preache to the Niniuites. Wel, I looked on the Gospel that is red thys daye, tut it liked me not, I looked on the Epistle: tushe I could not a waye wyth that neyther. And yet I remember I had preached vpon thys Epistle once afore Kyng Henry the. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . but now I could not frame wyth it, nor it liked me not in no sauce. Wel, thys saying of Paule came in my mynde, and at last I considered and wayed the matter deepelye, and then thought I thus with my selfe: Is Couetousnes the roote of all mischiefe, and of all euyll? then haue at the roote, & down withal couetousnes. So thys place of Paule brought me to thys text of Luke: See and beware of couetousnes. Therfore you Preachers out with your swordesPreachers must strike at the roote and strike at the roote, speake agaynst couetousnes, and crye out vpon it. Stand not tyckyng and toying at the braunches, nor at the boughes (for then there wil new boughes and braū ches spryng agayne of them) but strike at the roote, and feare not these Giauntes of Englande, these great men and men of power, these men that are oppressours of the poore. Feare thē not, but strike at the roote of all euyll, whych is myscheuous couetousnes. For couetousnes is the cause of rebellion. I haue forgotten my logyke, but yet I can iumble at a Silogisme, and make an argumēt of it to proue it by. Couetousnes is the roote of al euyl: Rebellion is an euil, Ergo Couetousnes is the roots of rebellion. And so it was in dede. Couetousnes was the causeThe cause of rebellion of rebellion this last Sommer, and both parties had couetousnes, as well the Gentlemen as the Commous. Both parties had Couetousnes, for both parties had an inordinate desyre to haue that they had not, and that is 
                        〈◊〉
                     , an inordinate desyre to haue that one hath not. The Commons would haue hadde from the Gentlemen suche thynges as they desyred. The Gentlemen would none of it, and so was there couetousnes on both sides. The Commons thought they had a ryght to

the thynges that they inordinatly sought to haue. But what then? they must not come to it that waye. Nowe on the other side the Gentlemen had a desire to keepe that they had, and so they rebelled to agaynste the kynges commaundement, and agaynst suche good order as he and hys counsel woulde haue set in the realme. And thus both parties had couetousnes, and both parties dyd rebell. I hearde saye that there was godlye ordinaunces deuised for the redresse of it. But the GiauntesThe frou ning of a Giaunt. would none of it in no sauce. I remember myne owne selfe a certayne Giaunt, a great man, who sat in commission about such matters. And when the tounsemen should bryng in what had beene inclosed, he frouned and chafed and so nere looked and threatened the poore men, tha they durst not aske theyr ryght. I red of late in an Act of Parliment: and thys Act made mencion of an act that was made in kyng Henries dayes (the

And there the Gentlemen that wer Landlordes, would nedes haue away muche landes from theyr tenauntes, and would needes haue an Act of parliment that it myght be lawfull for them to enclose and make seuerall from theyr tenauntes and from the Commons suche porcions of theyr landes as they thought good, muche a dooe there was about thys Act. At last it was concluded and graū
                     tedAn argument ment mete to be marked. that they myght so do: Prouided alway that they shoulde leaue sufficient to the tenaunt. Wel, it was wel that they wer bounde to leaue sufficient for theym. But who shoulde bee the Judge to lymite what was sufficient for theym. Or who shall nowe iudge what is sufficient? Wel I for my part can not tell what is sufficient. But me thought it was well that the tennaunts and poore commous should haue sufficient. For if they had sufficient (thought I) they had cause to be quiet. And thē 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      I to make thys argument within my selfe: If at that time it were put in theyr will and power, that they myght enclose, leauing to the tennaunt that were sufficient for hym, yf they had it then in theyr power (thought I) that they myght thys doo, they woulde leaue no more then sufficient.

If they lest to the tenauntes and poore commons no more in those dayes but sufficient: then if they had anye more taken from them since that time, then had they now not sufficient. They in Christ are equal with you.

much like as Ely was the cause of trouble in Israel, for hee was a preacher there, and tolde the people of all degres theyr faultes, and so they wynched and kycked at hym, and accused hym to Achab the King, that he was a sedicious fellow, and a troublous preacher and made much 
                        〈◊〉
                      in the Realme. So the King sente for hym, and he was brought to Achab the King, who sayd vnto hym: Art thou he that troubleth al

                      and Ely answered and sayd: naye, thou & thy Fathers house are they that trouble al Israell. Ely had preached Gods word, he had playnly told the people of theyr euill doinges, he had shewed them Gods threateninges: (In gods behalfe I speake, there is neither Kinge nor Emperour, be they neuer in so greate estate, but they are subiecte to Gods word) and therfore he was not afrayd to saye to Achab: it isThe cause of trouble. thou and thy fathers house that causeth all the trouble in Israel. Was not thys presumptuously spokē to a king? was not this a sedicious fellow? Was not thys fellowes preachyng a cause of all the trouble in Israel? was he not worthy to be cast

                      bocardo or lytle ease?

But Achab disobeyed hys swerd, which was the word of God. And therfore by the punishment of god much trouble arose in the Realm for the sinnes of Achab and the people. But Gods preacher, Gods prophet was not the cause of the trouble. Thē is it not we Preachers that trouble England. But here is now an argument to proue the mater against the preachers. Here was preaching against couetousnesPreaching against couetousnes al the last yeare in Lent, and the next somer solowed rebellion: Ergo preaching agaynst couetousnes, was the cause of the rebellion.

men that could of lykelyhod best certyfy hym of that matter conserning the stopping of Sandwich hauen. Among others came in before hym an olde man with a white head, and one that was thought to be lytle lesse then an hundereth yeares olde. When maister Moore saw thys aged man, he thought it expedient to heare hym say hys mynd in thys matter (for being so olde a man it was 
                        〈◊〉
                      that he knewe moste of any man in that presence and company.) So Maister 
                        〈◊〉
                      called this old aged man vnto hym, and sayd: Father (sayd he) tel me if ye can what is the cause of thys great arising of the sandes and shelues here about thys hauen, the which stop it vp that no shippes can ariue here? Ye are the eldest man that I can espye in al thys company, so that if any man can tell 
                        〈◊〉
                      cause of it, ye of lykely hode can say most in it, or at leastwyse more then any other man here assembled. Yea forsooth good Maister (quod this old man) for I am wel nighe an hundreth yeares old, and no man here in this company any thing

                  Well then (quod Mayster Moore) howe saye you in thys matter? what thincke ye to be the cause of these shelues and flattes that stoppe vp Sandwiche hauen? Forsoth syr (quoth he) I am an olde man, I thyncke that Tenterton 
                        〈◊〉
                      is the cause of Goodwyn sandes. For I am an old man syr (quod he) and I may remember the

                      or sands that 
                        〈◊〉
                      the hauen, and therfore I thinke that Tenterton steple is the cause of the destroyng and decaying of Sanwych hauen. And euen so to my purpose is preaching of Gods word the cause of rebellyon, as Tenterton steple was cause that Sandwich hauen is decayed.
                  And is not this a gaye matter, that suche shoulde be taken for great wyse men, that wyll thus reason agaynst the Preacher of Gods woorde?

                  At the fyrst the man and the woman wer equall. But after that she had geuen credit to the serpent, then she had a iniunction set vppon her: Subdita eris sub potestate uiri, thou shalte be subiect vnder the power of thy husband. And as for one

But this is now made a trifle and a small matter. And yet it is a sad matter, a godly matter, a gostly matter. A matter of dampnacion and saluacion. And Paule faithe that a woman ought to haue a power on her heade. What is thys to haue aWhy Women be couered. power on her head? It is a maner of speaking of the scripture, and to haue her power on her head, is to haue a sygne and token of power, whych is by couering of her heade,

                      that shee hath a superiour aboue her, by whom shee ought to be ruled and ordered. For she is not immediately vnder God, but mediately. For by their iniuncion the husbād is theyr head vnder God and they subiectes vnto their husbandes. But this power that some of them haue is disgysed geare and straunge facions. They must weare Frenchhoodes, and I can not tell you I, what to call it. And when they make theym ready and come to the coueryng of theyr head, they wyll call and saye, geue me my French hoode, and geue me my Bonet or my cap and so forth. I woulde wyth that the women would call the coueryng of theyr heades by the termes of the scripture. As when she would haue her cappe I would

At the tyme when thys fellow interrupted Christes sermon, he was preachyng a long? Sermon to hys Discyples, and to the people beyng gathered together in a wounderfull greate multitude as appeareth in the. xii. Chapter of Saynte Lukes Gospell, and there he first of all taught hys Disciples a good lesson, saying: Cauete uobis a farmento Phariseorum. Beware in any wise (sayth he) from the 
                        〈◊〉
                      of the Pharises. What is

                         taken. thys leuen of the Pharises? Leauen is somtimes taken for corrupt lyuyng, whych infecteth others by the euil example ther of, and against suche corrupt liuing, Gods preacher muste cry oute earnestlye, and neuer sease till it be rooted vp. In the Citie of Corinth one had maried his stepmother, hys fathers wyfe. And he was a 
                        〈◊〉
                      follow, a great riche man, an alderman of the City, and therfore they wincked at it, they would not medle in the matter, they had nothing to do with it, and he was one of the head men, ofsuche rule and authority that they durst not, manye of them. But. S. Paule hearing of the matter, writ vnto them, and in Gods behalfe charged them, to do awaye suche abhominacion from among them. Saynt Paule would not leaue them, till he had excommunicated thePaule excō 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      wycked doer of suche abhominacion. If we shoulde nowe excommunicate all suche wycked doers, ther would be muche a do in England. Ye that are Magestrates, 
                        〈◊〉
                      fauoure for affection to suche, and wyll not suffer they maye be rooted out or put to shame. Oh, he is suche a mans seruaunt, we may not do him any shame. Oh, he is a gentleman. &c. And so the thing is not now any thing looked vnto. Lechery is vsed thorowe out England, & suche lechery as is vsed in none other place of the world. And yet it is made a matter of sport, a of matter no thing, a laughing matter, and a tryfle not to be passed on, nor not to be refourmed.
                  But beware ye that are Maiestrates, theyr synne dothe leauen you all. Therefore for Gods loue beware of thys leauen. Wel, I truste it wyll be one day amended. I looke not to liue long, & yet I trust (as old as I am) to liue so long as to see Lechery punyshed. I would wysh that Moyses lawe were 
                        〈◊〉
                      for punyshment of Lechery, and that the offenders ther in myght be punyshed according to the

                      of

lawe. And here I wyll make a sute to your hyghenesse to restore vnto the Church the discipline of Christ. In excommunicatingGod can make best lawes. suche as be notable offenders, nor neuer 
                        〈◊〉
                      anye other way. For no man is able to deuise a better way then God hath done, which is excommunicacion to put them from the congregacion 
                        〈◊〉
                      they be confounded. Therfore restore Christes discipline for excommunicacion. And that shal be a mean both to pacifye Gods wrath and indignacion against vs, and also that lesse abommacion shall be vsed, then in tymes past hath bene, and is at thys day. I speake thys of a conscience, and I meane and moue it of a good wil to your grace and your Realme.
                  Bring into the Churche of Englande open Discipline of excommunicacion, that open synners maye bee stricken with all. Somtime Leauen is taken for corrupt Doctrine, and so it is here taken in this place when 
                        〈◊〉
                      saithe: Beware of the leauen of the Phariseis. For Christ intended to make his disciples

                        〈◊〉
                      of the Pharises. Yea and where there is anye peece of Leauen, they wyll maintayne that one

                     , more then all the doctryne of Christ, and about that purpose they occupy and bestowe all theyr wittes. Thys was the first seed. The seconde seed was Nihil occultum, quod non reuelabitur. There is nothing 
                        〈◊〉
                      or hidden that shal not be reuealed and opened: It parteyneth all to one purpose, for there he taught his disciples too beware of the leauen, which was hypocrisye, declaryng vnto them that hypocrisye wouldeGods

It hath also an other meanyng, for it is Gods prouerbe. There is nothyng so pryuye but it shall be opened, at leaste wyse in the great daye of

For the scripture sayth: Omnes moriemur. We shall dye euery one of vs, yet som shall be rapt and taken a liue, as S. Paule saith. For this priuiledge of a few, doth not hurte a generalty. An irremissible sinne, an vnercusable sin, yet to him that will truly repent, it is forgeueable, In Christe it may be remitted, if there be no more but one man forgeuen, ye maye be that same one man that shall be forgeuen.

                      this promise was made, and yet God hathe ben true of his promise vnto this day. So that now when we see the rainbow we may learn that god is true of his promise. And as God was true in this promes, so is he & wil be, in al the reast, but the couetous mā doth nat beleue that god is true of his promise, for if he did, he woulde not sticke to geue of his goods to yt poore. But as touching that I spake afore, when we see the rainbow, and see in the rainbow that that is like water, and of a watrie colour and as we may and ought not only to take therof holde and comfort of Goddes

promise, that he will no more destroye the world with water for sinne but also we may take an example to feare god,What the rain bow teacheth. who in such wise hateth sin. Likewise when in the rainbow we see that that is of firye couloure, and like vnto fire, we may gather an example of the ende of the worlde, that except we amende, the world shall at last be consumed with fire for sin, and to feare the iudgement of God, after which they that are damned, shal be burned in hel fyre. These wer the seedes that Christe was sowing, when thys couetous man came vnto him. And now I am come to my matter. While Christe was this preaching, thus couetous fellowe would not tary till all the sermon was done, but interrupted the sermon, euen sodenly chopping in. Master (quod he) speake to my brother, that he may deuide the inheritance with me. He woulde not abide tyll the ende of the Sermō. But his minde was on his halfepeny, and he would nedes haue his matter dispatched out of hande, Master (quod he) let my brother diuide with me. Yet this was a good fellow he could be contented with parte, he desired not to haue all together alone to himself, but coulde be content with a diuisyon, and to haue hys parte of the inheritance, & what was the enheritance?

So that the concord of brethren & agreeing of brethren is a gay thing. What sayeth Salomon of this matter? Frater qui adiuuatur a fratre quasi ciuitas firma, et turris fortis. The brother that is

Brethren that haue so raygned here in England haue quarelled one with a nother, and the yonger had ben contented with hys portion (as in deede the yonger brother commonly ierreth first) but by the contencion bothe hathe fared the wors. So when there is any contention betwen brother and brother for land, commonly they ar both vndon by it.

It is no smal mater (sayth Austen) of what intencion one asketh a question, as Christe in an other place of the gospell, asketh who was neighbour to the pilgrime that was wounded. There was (sayeth Christ) a man that went from Ierusalem to Hierico, and fell amonge theues, and they wounded hym & lefte him for dead. And a priest came by, that was his owne contreyman and let him lye, a Leuit came by and would shew no compassion vpon him: at last a Samaritane came by, & set him on his horse, and conueyed him to the citie, and prouided surgery for him. &c. Now who was neighbour to this wounded man (sayeth Christe?) Qui fecit illi misericordiam (quod the Lawyer.) He that shewed mercy vnto hym. He that did the office of a neyghboure, he was neyghbour.

                      Christ refused the office of a iudge, ergo there ought to be no iudges nor magistrates a mong Christian men. If it had ben a thing lawfull, Christ would not haue refused to do the office of a iudge, & to haue determined yt variaūce betwene these ii. brethrē. But Christ did therby signify, that he was not sent for that office. But if thou wilt haue a triall and a sentence of that matter according to the lawes, thou must go to the temporall iudge that is deputed therfore, but Christes meaning was, that he was come for an other purpose, he had another office deputed vnto him, then to be a iudge in temporall matters, Ego veni vocare peccatores ad penitenciam, I am com (sayth he) to call sinners to repentance. He was come to preache the Gospell, the remission of sinne, and the kingdom of God and ment not therby to disalow the office of temporall maThe

But the matter is, that this couetous man, this brother tooke his marke amis, for he came to a wrong man to seke redres of his matter, nor Christ did not forbid hym to seeke his remedye at the magistrates hande, but Christe refused to take vpon hym thē office that was not hys callyng.

For Chryste had an other vocation then to be a iudge betwene such as contended about matters of land. If our rebels had had this in their mindes, they would not haue ben their owne iudges, but they would haue sought the redres of their grief at the handes of the king and his magistratesThe canse of

And the Lorde came, and was there, but he appered not: No quod the kynge? was he sommoned as he shoulde be? had he any warning to be here? It was answered, yea,

and that he was there walkinge vp and downe in the hall, and that he knew wel inough that that was his daye, and also that he had al ready bene called, but he said he would not come before the king at that time, allcoginge that he neaded not as yet to make an aunswer, because he had had but one summoning. No quod the kyng? is hehere present: yea forsoth sir said the priest. The king commaunded him to be called, and to come before him. And the end was this. He made this Lord, this great man to restore vnto ye priest not only the glebeland which he had taken from the priest but also the rent and profit therof, for so longe time as he had withholden it frō the priest whiche was viii. yeares or therabout (saith he) when ye can shewe better cuidence the the priest hath done, why it ought to be your land, then he shal restore it to you again and the profyts therof, that he shal receiue in the meane time. But till that daye come, I charge ye that ye suffer him peaceably to enioy that is his. Thys is a noble king, and this I tel for your example, that ye may do the lyke.

It is a great matter to offer christ, if Christ had offred his body at yt last supper, then shuld we so do to, who is worthy to offer vp Christ? an abhominable presum cyon Paule sayth Accepit panem, postquam gracias egissit fregit ac dixit, Accipite, edite. He tooke bread and after that he had geuen thankes, he bralie it, and saide. Take ye, eate ye. &c. and so sayd: Hoc est corpus meum, He gaue thankes, well thē in thanks geuing there is non oblation, and when he gaue thankes it was not hys bodye.
                  When I was in examination. I was asked many questiōs, and it was sayd to me: what Christ did, that should we do: a bishop gathered that vpon these wordes. Hoc facite inmei recordacionem. Then said he to me, how knowe ye that they eate it before he sayde, Hoc est corpus meum. I answered agayne and sayd: how know ye that they did not eate it. &c. So I brought into him the place of Paul aboue sayd, and that in thankes geuing is none oblation, and when he gaue thankes it was not his body, for he gaue thankes in the beginnyng of supper, before they eate any māner thing at all, as his accustomed maner was to do. I wonder therfore that they will or dare by this text, take vppon them to offer Christs body. They should rather saye: Quis me constituit oblatorem? Who made me an offerer? But when Christ sayd: Quis me constituit iudicem aut diuisorem super vos? Who hath made me a Iudge, or a deuider of landes among you?

Thou man thou felow (quod he) who hathe made me a iudge, among you? And he said vnto all the audience: Videte, et caue te ab auaricia. See and beware of couetousnes. Whye so? Qui a non in abundancia cuiusquoem vita eius est, ex his que possidet. For no mannes life standeth in the habundaunce of the thynges whyche he possesseth, we may: haue thynges necessarye, and we may haue habouudaunce of thinges, but the haboundance doth not make vs blessed. It is no good argumēt. Quo plus quisque habet, tanto beatus viuit. The more riches that a man hath the more happelly & the more blisfullye he lyueth.

If a man should fil him selfe vp to the throte, he should not finde ease in it, but displeasure, and wyth the one halfe he myght satisfy his greadye appetite. So this great rychesse neuer maketh a mannes life quiet, but rather troublous I remember here a saying of Salomon, and hys example. Coaceruaui mihi argentum & aurum.

Therfore, leaue couetousnesse, for beleue me if I had an enemy. The first thing that I wold wish to him, should be, that he mighte haue aboundaunce of richesse, for so I am sure, he shuld neuer be in quiet. But think ye there be not many yt would be so hurt?
