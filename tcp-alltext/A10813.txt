            To the Right worshipfull true profeſſor, follower of Armes, and marſhall diſcipline, the Renowmed Captaine, Thomas Lea, Eſquire, H. R. your worships faithfull wel-willer, wisheth aboundance of all worldly happineſſe, with h

               MAny Poettes, Right worſhipfull Captaine, haue written the honours of ſuch Noble and bewtifull Ladies as they adore, applauding in heroicall verſe and moſt eloquent proſe, their worthineſſe, ſome vnder one title, ſome another, each one in his ſeuerall humour as their Patronize doth merit: to thoſe whoſe quaint conceits, and wittie inuentions are ſuch, I leaue thoſe amorous Subiects; ſinging in my harſh Tunes, the honours of a Souldier, a Prince borne, and a Noble profeſſour of Armes, which I boldly offer vnto your worſhip, that is a Patron to all, profeſsing marſhall diſcipline: and woorthily is ſo called, in all places where your forward ſeruice hath bene approued, but eſpecially regiſtred for a mirror of gentilitie, and honourable Souldier of our time, amongſt the Iriſh Nation, and

inhabitants of that land, where your name is both feared and beloued, the one for your reſolution, the other, for your vertues, bountie, and clemencie, whereof daily they reape the benefit. The due conſideration of all which, hath halled me on thus farre to aduenture, hoping your accuſtomed fauour ſhal be a protection to this ſtraunger, whoſe honours, if you vouchſafe at ſuch times as your ſerious affaires ſhall permit leiſure to peruſe, I hope ſomthing therin may moue your delight, which I hartily wiſh. If happily it ſo proue, I ſhall hereafter be imboldned to ſhew my ſlender ſkill, in explaining the honors and vertues of our home-born aduenturers, whoſe honourable actions, are not the leaſt in account, nor ought to reſt in obliuion. Till when and euer, amongſt thoſe which your worſhips fauours haue tyed in true loue vnto you, I will offer my vnfeined and dutifull ſeruice.

            To my beloued Country men, the curteous Readers.
            
               GEntlemen, after many bloudie bickerings and daungerous hazards in great perils on the ſeas, I haue recouered the hauen of my deſire, and haue brought for your delighte, this ſtrannger Knight, a Prince borne, endued with much honour, who being a man famous, as his actions importeth. Albeit my skill is not ſuch as is required, yet haue taken vpon me a Pilots charge, and in ſafetie haue ſet him a ſhoare, where his deſire led him, vnto whom Gentiles (my hope is) your accuſtomed fauour to all ſtrangers ſhall not be denied, being a Cauilere of fame: how plainly ſo euer you ſee him attired, yet accept him, and as a Traueller comming of good will, bid him welcome, and with fauour, peruſe his honours in Armes gained, which I hope may in ſome ſort delight you, if happily it prooue as I deſire, he hath his wiſh. But (how ſo euer) diſcountenance

him not altogither, whoſe will is to deſerue well. Abrupt faultes, he may vnwillingly cōmit many, which if according to your accuſtomed curteſies you vouchſafe to pardon, and after his long trauaile, with careful trouble, to delight you, receiue but the leaſt ſhewe of good liking, it is all he exſpecteth: your curteſie is more then the coſt, from which as you are Engliſh men and Gentiles allianate, ſo ſhall hee endeuour to deſerue better, and ſhall in his trauaile hereafter, report of you as you are, and binde me his carefull Pylot, your Country man, through whoſe procurement hee is come hither, to your humble ſeruice.
            
               Yours euer.

            Pheander, The Mayden Knight: deſcribing his honorable Trauels and haughty attempts in Armes, wtih his ſucceſſe in loue.
            
               WHat time Manpelious raigned king in Numedia, as their ancient annuals record, Thelarchus likewiſe ſwayed the Diademe in Thrace, a Prince ſo highlie renowmed for all honourable actions, as few ſuch in his time liued. This Thelarchus, in the blooming of his Princelie yeares, deſirous to leaue iſſue to his Noble houſe, ioyned in marriage with Alinda, daughter and ſole heire to Conſtantius, Emperour of Germanie, by whome in ſhort time after their Nuptials, he had iſſue one daughter, who was named Nutania, (This princeſſe) as in comelineſſe of perſon ſhee exceeded, ſo for her beautie, wiſdome and other good graces, there liued none her equall: the reporte of whoſe excellence, as Fame aduanceth with her loudeſt trump the honorable (eſpecially) ſuch péereleſſe creatures, as this Princeſſe (yea) ſo highlie ſtood-ſhee graced in the Gods fauour, that none but Nutanias beautie was remembred in moſt Princes Courts, both Chriſtian and heathen.
            The renowme of whoſe peereleſſe beautie, ſo often blazed, came to the hearing of Dionicus, ſon and heir apparant of the Numidian King, who vpon the ſurpaſſing praiſes by

euery one giuen of this Lady, begun more and more vpon hearing ſuch ſeuerall reportes, to conceiue an inwarde ioy of her, diligently hearkening to each ſtranger which ſhould recount her vertues, and honour by vertue gayned. Long had not this humour followed the louely Prince Dionicus, but loue the ſoueraign guide of mens thoughts, had ſo enthralled him, that all his delight was in contemplating of this Princeſſe beautie, yea ſo was he ouertaken in loues ſnare, that nothing was pleaſing vnto him, but the ſwéete remembrance of Nutania: ſo much was his delight in her▪ that oftentimes, in the midſt of his paſtimes, calling the Princeſſe to minde, he would as one paſt himſelfe, altogether ouercome with melancholy, abandon the cōpany of his moſt familiars, ſéeking frō their pleaſing paſtimes ſome ſolitary place, where he might vnheard or ſéen recount wt large amplificatiōs the Princeſſe beauty, whoſe ſeruant in mind he was wholly vowed. Thus dallied Dionicus ſo long with beauties flame, that ouertaken with the vehemency therof, he fell into an extreame feuer, which in ſuch ſtrange maner aſſayled him, as the learnedſt Phyſitions could not find any reaſon of the diſeaſe, much leſſe procure his health, who lāquiſhed in loue, not daring to diſcloſe his grief to any, or acquaint his truſtieſt cōpanion with his loue. This ſudden alteration of the Prince, in whoſe welfare the comfort not onlie of his companions in Court, but generally of the commons conſiſted, mooued them al to ſuch excéeding griefe, that in ſhort time their louely countenances were ſo much altered, that neither pleaſing looke, nor chearfull word, was to be obtained from them.
            The King, whoſe aged life depended on the happineſſe of his ſon, as fathers how baſe ſoeuer, delight in vertuous offſprings, much more the Noble, whoſe honors are to bee mainteined by their progeny: the aged king, whoſe greateſt felicity was in the prince, was with ſuch infinit griefs oppreſſed, that in ſhort time his body was ſo weakened, that rather he deſired to accompany the dead, then liue in ſuch

diſcontent, the mother Quéene, with ouer much care and watching néere pined, and few which felt not ſome part of the Princes griefe, ſuch was their faithful loues vnto him whereof the father gloried not a little, and the mother (if women may be proud) was not a litle ſpiced with y• diſeaſe. But neither the heauines of the father, the extreame griefe of the mother, the daylie lamenting of the Courtiers, nor the complaints of the Commons might any way auail the Prince, who ſmothering his own ſorrowe, could not by al art (Phyſicke allowed for mens reliefe) be any way comforted. The ouer grieued burthen of whoſe miſeries the Quéene with his kinglie father ſéeking to eaſe, and coulde not as he deſired accompliſh, ſuch extremity likewiſe aſſailed them, that the learnedſt coulde not iudge the difference betwéene them, (ſo that by their ill) ſuppoſe the ſubiectes griefe, which reuerently honoured them, and could willinglie haue offered their owne liues for their reliefe and eaſe.
            But in vaine ſtriue they, that ſéeke helpe for him whome none but the beautifull Nutania could releaſe, who was the Load-ſtarre of his life: and the loue of her, the ſpeciall Phyſicke which muſte reſtore him, or dye hee would paſt all recouery, but by Nutania, that Paragone of fame, Dianaes glorie, Natures onely darling, and delight.
            Weake and féeble, paſt recure of Phyſicke, became the King and Quéen, voyd of hope euer to ſee their Princely ſonnes recouerye: wherefore, forgetting all worldly pleaſure and Princely delightes, ſuch as become Princes ofſo high eſtéeme, quyte aboliſhing all the vanities of the worlde, they minde wholly the euerlaſting comfort, and ioye in nothing, but his death, that from death, by his blood redéemed them.
            In this extremity, when all hopes wer paſt help of men, behold the mercy of him that preſerueth and deſtroyeth at his pleaſure, who mooued no doubt, at the interceſſion of

ſome their vertuous ſubiectes, or taking pittie of their diſtreſſe, as wee read in holie writ, teſtimony of our ſoules comfort, how Abraham beloued of God, mooued his diuine Deitie for thoſe Cities for ſinne by his iuſt iudgment conſumed, if fiue godlie people▪ had bene founde within their walles, they had bene preſerued: ſo either for the vertues of the King, or the interceſſion of thoſe ſorrowing ſubiects, the giuer of all comfort ſent them comforte, as you ſhall heare.
            The Numedian King, whoſe prime of youth was ſpent in manie honourable actions, holding in great regard the loue of his neighbour Princes, liued in ſuch tranquility, that he was honoured of all that heard of his gouernment. The report of whoſe long ſickneſſe and weake eſtate, moued the Kings of diuers regions, by their embaſſage, to comfort them, and to bee aduertized of the trueth of their eſtates. Amongſt which thoſe honorable Princes that held his health in ſuch regard, Thelarchus King of Thrace diſpatched his Ambaſſadour. Who for the more honour of their King, was accompanied with diuers Gentlemen, both of honour and great worſhip.
            Theſe Ambaſſadors ariuing at the Court of Numedia, their cauſe of comming vnknowne, many matters were of the commons ſuppoſed (who will entermeddle with Princes affairs) ſo that amongſt them diuers things were imagined, and ſundrie dangers ſuſpected, but no aſſurance of anie, vntill their day of hearing, which the king appointed to be as ſodaine as they could require.
            Againſt which time royall preparation was made, with all the pompe could be deuiſed, where for feaſting there wanted no daintie, how rare ſoeuer, nor diuerſitie of Vyandes to pleaſe the appetite, with many pleaſing ſhowes, and paſtimes, the better to giue them occaſion of welcome: all which, notwithſtanding the Kings weakneſſe, was ſo exquiſitlie performed, that it was admirable.
            The day of hearing come (as time ſtayeth not) Manpelious
               
hauing ſummoned his councell and chiefeſt Nobilitie, againſt that time to attende his pleaſure: theſe ſeuerall Ambaſſadors were brought to his preſence, where with more ſhewe of hartie welcome, then his weak bodie could deliuer, hee gaue them ſuch honourable entertainment, as beſéemed the meſſengers of ſuch Princes, and highly contented them, whoſe curteſie the ſtrangers Nobles applauded, and gréeued the more at his extremity, by how much the more they ſaw his debilitie.
            After ſome talke paſſed betwéen the King and theſe Nobles, and that hee had enquired with all kindneſſe of the health of their Princes, and welfare of their countries, and receiued their Letters with diuers Princelie preſentes, they were diſmiſſed, but yet not ſuffered to depart, without gracious thanks to their kinges, and kind ſhew of good acceptance of their paines, leauing them to their repoſe, with great charge to his Nobles and thoſe in authoritie, to ſée their entertainment ſuch, as if their ſoueraigne Lordes were preſent: which charge was not forgotten of thoſe which prized their Princes honours as dear as their liues, but with ſuch pompe and coſte accompliſhed each ſeuerall commaunde of his Highneſſe: as the Strangers might wel admire to beholde it. Their diets ſo diuerſe and ſo aboundant, as they had neuer ſéene the like, furniſhed with ſo much ſundrie muſicke, and ſo cunningy vſed, as might well delight the Goddes. To acquaint you with other paſtimes, for recreation, as Playes, Maſkes, Tilting, Turneying, Barriours, and other Courtly paſtimes, beſides, their hunting of Tygers, wilde Bores, and Lyons, which mooued ſuche delight, as other ſportes pleaſure vnto them. Thus in vſing dayly thoſe pleaſures, when the Nobles had ſpent ſome time in the Court, euerie one content with his royall entertainment, hearing amongſt the Nobles of the countrie ſuch generall honour of the Prince Dionicus, whome they had not yet ſeene, an eſpeciall deſire mooued them to viſite the Prince, bewayling greatly that mooued

ſuch aduerſe chances, ſhould nip ſo braue and honorable a Prince, in the blooming time of his princely yeares.
            The Prince Dionicus, albeit the imbecility of his body denied thoſe nobles his preſēce at their paſtimes, in which ſeueral ſport he much delighted, yet that they might not depart of him vnſéen, he commanded a ſumptuous banquet in his lodging to be ordained: 
                  •
               o which he inuited the ſtrāger Nobles & their companies: who wiſhing to ſée the Prince, were as glad to accompany him, as hee deſirous of their companie, and graciouſly with many humble thankes, accepted the Princes good wil. The youthfull Nobles attendant on the Prince, carefull to ſée each thing ordered, for the honour of his Maieſtie, wanted nothing that might bée deſired, only exſpected the comming of their gueſtes, who not vnmindful of their promiſe, as dinner time drew nigh, prepared themſelues towards the Prince, vnto whome by his Nobility in moſt gorgious maner, they were conducted: no ſooner entred they his preſence, but Dionicus, whoſe curteſie was ſuch as gained the loue of his ſubiects, and all ſtrangers that had ſéen his demeanor, yet at this time had better knowledge how to entertaine them, then abilitie to performe what he would, ſtretching himſelfe in his bed, as his weake limbes would ſuffer him, hee gaue them ſuch harty welcoms, as highly contented them, & beſéemed their eſtates. Theſe Nobles when they had made their eies witneſſes, of what report had ſo often bruted, rather accuſed report of great wrong, in not giuing him ſuch due as hée deſerued, then of ouer much praiſe: for that the fame bruted of him, was not to be valued with his woorthineſſe. The time of dinner paſſed they, with many glaunces on the Prince, noting his curteſie, but euer lamenting his griefe, & wiſhing his health, framing them ſelues to pleaſant diſcourſes, to put him from thoſe melancholie thoughtes, wherewith hée was ouer much burthened. Thus with much diuerſitie of table talke, conſumed the time, the grauer ſort, of matters for benefite of the ſtate: the gréener

heades whoſe yeares required no other cares of their pleaſing paſtimes and pleaſure, the managing their horſes, commending the ſtatelineſſe of their bodies, their ſineneſſe in careyring their brauerie in their Coruet, and excellent ſwiftneſſe in their gallop, their readines in hand, and their courage in the face of the enemie: not omitting the gallant cryes of their hounds, nor forgetting, by which and which, ſuch a bucke was ſlaine, and ſuch a Stag puld down, paſſing not, without high commending the ſoring of their hawkes, nor forgetting their ſtatelineſſe in flight, with their fearce ſeazing on their game. And then for variety, as occaſion is miniſtred, Carowſe a health to their Miſtreſſe and Loues, in their country.
            The Prince as louely as the beſt, & in his health as wel able to performe whatſoeuer, had his greateſt comfort in liſtening to the talke of Cariolus and Octauius, two noble men of Thrace, which accompanied of pleaſure Atlautus, the chiefe in commiſſion for their king. Dionicus earneſtlie noting theſe two Nobles of Thrace, as moſt delighted with their perſons and pleaſant parlie, heard Cariolus carowſe a health to the Princeſſe Nutania: whoſe name the diſtreſſed Prince no ſooner heard vttered, but the remembrance of that ſwéet obiect, his liues ſole health, and miſtreſſe of his fancies, ſo reuiued his dying ſpirits, that ſuddenly the beholders might wel perceiue his wan cullour, which argued a troubled ſhirit, to vaniſh, and thoſe vermilion died roſes, the woonted badges, & ornaments of his ſwéet face, challenge their former intreſt, and for a time poſſeſſe them, reſtoring vnto Nature her due, making his louelie countenance as chearfull to the beholders, as the glorious Sun to the captiued, whoſe liberty being depriued, haue long bin debarred of al worldly delights, & ſeldom receiued comfort from that heauenlie eſſence. This chearful alteration in the Prince was noted of diuers, whoſe eares, albeit buſied in liſtening to the diſcourſes of theſe ſtrangers; yet the eies of his own attendants, with dutiful care, gaue héede vnto the Prince.
            
               Amongſt thoſe vnto whoſe gouernmēt the care of ye princes health was committed, Barnardine, a man for his arte famous, and learned in his profeſſion (which was phyſick) who ſomtime was tutor vnto him, noting this ſudden chāge in the Prince, ſuppoſing verily by his countenance, that ſome of their ſpeeches did mooue him to content, comming ſuddenly to him, and graſping his arme, felt his pulſes beat ſo fiercely, as in long time they had not done the like; which made him more conſideratly ſearch, to find the cauſe of this motion, enquire it he durſt not, doubting to mooue him to melancholie, hauing ſo often bene denyed, but reſting by him a while, continuing with his arme graſped, hee felt the pulſe more and more to worke, which gaue him the more cauſe, to finde if hee might, the originall from whence it came, and noting diligentlie vnto which of the companie he moſt inclined his eyes, hee might perceiue Cariolus and his Octauius earneſtlie bufied in their former talke, which was, I dare ſay, neither of religion, nor of gouernment of the State, yet was it ſuch as Barnardine perceiued, hightie contented the Prince, and deſired it might long continue, ſo it were for his Lords good. Manie pretie queſtions paſſed betweene them, and much varietie, in whoſe prattle many a faire Ladie was commended by one, and for argument as highly of the other diſcommended, in which humour were diuers of the Nobilitie of the countrie, and Ladies of woorth by name queſtioned of, and many a youthfull pra
                  •
               ke by themſelues committed, yet all in friendſhip, and kindly taken, though harſh frumpes paſſed ſomtimes betweene them, which mooued them to much myrth. But when in earneſt Octauius forgetting himſelf, falling from one matter to another, and that there ſhould be a iudgment giuen, who for beautie was the onlie paragon, Octauius for affection commended Brionella, daughter and ſole heire of Conſtantine, king of Boheme, in whoſe fathers court, he had long bene trayned vp, giuing the prize from their owne country Ladies: Whereat Cariolus, as if hee had bene the

ſworne Champion of their Land, mooued at his raſh cenſure, forgetting the reuerence of the place, tolde him flatly his iudgement was falſe, and that he would auow: offering his gloue in combate, to maintaine that the Princeſſe Nutania, and none but ſhe, deſerued ye name of beautiful: whoſe wiſedome, and other good graces, in any one, was not to be found in the circuit of the earth: and therefore Octauius, (quoth he,) thou haſt done ouer much wrong, to derogate the honour due to Thracian Dames, eſpecially our péerleſſe Nutania, whoſe face it beauteous Helena liued, for whome ſo many thouſands loſt their liues, ſhée might well reſigne that title of the onely faire, to her, and none but ſhee: whoſe like liueth not.
            
               Octauius, who was wiſe and well demeaned, perceiuing this parlie begun in ieſt, likely to end in quarrell, noting likewiſe, how the reſt of the company ceaſed their ſerious talk, to attend them, with a ſmiling countenance, as one not poſſeſt with choller, brake off his talke thus.
            Why (my Lord) ſhall matter of ſo ſmall moment cauſe friends to iarre? What is beauty, whereof we haue ſo long diſputed, and ſo highly of vs regarded? nothing but a fading pleaſure, an ornament of the face which maketh the heart proud, and draweth the mind from euery good motion, to manie odious offences, whereby the honorable in committing diſhonourable actions, are ſo blemiſhed, that they become a common by-word to the verieſt drudge that Nature hath framed. Helena was faire, and accounted the onely of her time, yet who ſo much ſcorned? Creſſida beautiful, yet who more falſe? If beautie be attended on with ſuch ſhame as theſe two famous women gained, why ſhould wee care who is beautifull? My ſwéet Cariolus miſtake me not, if I haue paſſed my iudgement raſhly, for neither care I whoſe fame in that caſe is eſtéemed or defamed, but paſſe them by as things of no regard; onely for argument I haue ſpoken more then either I regard or account of: therefore let not this be any breach of our friendſhip, for I proteſt, if thou

ſhouldſt ſay, the white Swanne were as blacke as the rauen, the Ocean drie, and ſhippes floting on the maine, I would affirme it, rather than our friendſhip ſhould bee for ſuch a matter diſcontinued.
            Well Octauius (quoth Cariolus) I finde your kindneſſe great, & wil thank you for it, but truſt mee, this gloze may not ſerue your turn, for as you haue ſpoken hereſie againſt Beauty, and maintained a ſtrāger before your home-born Ladies, you ſhal either recant your Iudgment, before our ſoueraigne Princeſie Nutania, or receiue ſuch penance, by your queſt aſſigned, which I promiſe thée ſhall be all honorable Ladies. Oh my Lord (anſwered Octauius) I hope I ſhal find your H. more kinde, then for ſo ſmall an offence to deliuer your friend priſoner at the bar, where the parties ſhal be Iudges, & my Iurie ſuch, as all lawes allowe me to appeal from, if you ſhould, & my fault ſuch, as if my life were in their trial depending, I might wel make my teſtament, & diſpoſe of what I poſſeſſe, hartily deſiring God to receiue my ſoul, for ſure I am, my body ſhuld not long inioy breath; for no greater corraſiue can be offered that Ser, then to attribute the honor of ſuch a prize to any one particular, they all ſtanding on tearmes of beauty, as the Crowe which thinks her owne birds faireſt: ſo women how ill-faced and wrinkled ſoeuer they be, may not endure to hear any commended, if happily they ſhuld hear it ſpoken by ſuch as they dare not in ſpeech diſpleaſe, yet wil their countenance ſhew their hearts diſcontent, by ſcrowling of ye browes, hanging the lip, or ſetting a ſwéet face, as ſugred as the galle, or by ſome ſuch outward action or other, ſhal you find where that nipt her, for which offence looked ſhe neuer ſo highly, with Bell, Booke and Candle, you ſhall bée curſſed, and neuer more come in Paternoſter, how déepe ſoeuer you haue bene in her Creed.
            
            Hold, hold, Octauius, quoth Cariolus, too much of one thing is good for nothing: Thou haſt plaid the excellent Orator. Who had thought your Lordſhips experience had bin ſuch,

for thereon I know you ground all your authority: Author I am ſure in ſchooles you neuer read any, which haue ſo highlie abuſed that ſacred Sex, ſacred I may wel cal them my Octauius, who are not honoured of mortall creatures, but of the goddes, and therfore in the higher account, and the more in regarde, the greater thy offence, and the more grieuous thy puniſhment.
            To this pleaſant diſcourſe the whole aſſembly gaue ear, and were greatly therwith delighted, yet to put them from it, and to end as pleaſantly, Atlantus ſaid:
            My Lord Cariolus; what, is your honor become Beauties Champion? Farre was it from my thought, that euer you woulde with ſuch earneſtneſſe haue defended our faire Ladies, but ſince I ſée you are ſo great an Aduocate, I will cauſe you to haue thanks for it at our return, other reward I dare promiſe none. And you my Lord Octauius, that ſo clarkly haue depraued them, would I might be your ſcholler, whoſe experience is ſo great, Tully, Ouid, or Marcus Aurelius, that wrote moſt in their diſgrace, neuer writ ſo largelie, I muſt néeds ſay, as my Lord Cariolus, our ladies are litle beholding vnto you, for the daunger committed in the ſame, the leaſt is hereſie, and how hereſie is to be puniſhed your honor knoweth: yet my Lord, as I would gladly become a peacemaker, and that friendes may not grow at ods, whereby any daunger might happen to your perſon, albeit the offence be not pardonable, yet the fault made in a forrain countrey ought there to haue his triall. If it ſhall ſtand with your good liking, no ladies preſent to heare your hard cenſure, your fauor may be the more: & ſince I haue by patiēce of this honorable cōpany, intruded my ſelf to ſpeak in our ladies cauſe, not being a feed Counceller for them, I wil entreat theſe noble Gentlemen to giue me leaue, & let me cenſure of y• ſame, ſo it ſtand with your L. good pleaſure.
            Now truly quoth Octauius, I find your L. kind, and more kind then I can either deſire or deſerue, when I ſhall néed your fauour in matter of more importe, I will make bold:

til when, I put you down with Cariolus for one of my ſmal friends, for this matter I ſhal néed ſmall friendſhip, vnleſſe to bring your cauſe to better effect, you doe as manie crafty people now a dayes vſe, to make ſmall conſcience, in ſelling mens ſoules to the deuill for mony, to ſweare what he ſhall commaund them, how falſe ſoeuer, to the impoueriſhing of many, whoſe good hoſpitality, and other good neighbourhood, was more then euer ſuch baſe villaines coulde reach vnto, if ſuch a companiō you mate me with, or ſearch out ſome ſubtil lawyer that can by his querkes and quidities in lawe, make a bad matter good, and annointing the Iudge with vnguentum aurum, cauſe him to incline to the ſame, my cake is dough, if by ſuch ſubornation, forſwearing and falſe iudgement, my ſpeach be wreſted to your aduantage.
            Ceaſe my Octauius, this dread, heauens forfend, for this offence thy puniſhment ſhould bée as thou deſerueſt, much leſſe that anie ſiniſter meanes ſhould be vſed to bring thée to open penance, yet good Octauius let me entreat thée, as in this aſſemblie thou haſt vniuſtly giuen the prize of beauty to Brionella, and therein haſt wronged highly the onely of the world, by thy partiall iudgement, in derogating from her the title of moſt excellent, which is moſt honourable, & no more than her worth requireth: confeſſe but thy fault and errour in the ſame, and an end, if thou loueſt thy owne good, refuſe not this offer, leaſt worſe befall thée then Acteon, or to Paris for his raſh iudgment. Thou haſt learned vs in thine owne Exordium, that women are inſpired with mindes of reuenge. Be therefore by thy friendes entreated before the puniſhment come vpon thée, ſo maiſt thou kéepe thée from much ſorrowe, for if no greater miſchiefe fal vpon thée, thou ſhalt be ſure of more curſes, then thy weake carcaſe can beare: for my Octauius, in friendſhip I ſay this, and warne thée as one that loueth thée, knowing their inclinations, which as thy ſelfe confeſſeth, is bent to reuenge: if ſo, as many as ſhall heare of this blaſphemie, if they do thée no

other ill, their curſing thou ſhalt be ſure of, and womens curſes, are as bad as the curſe of holy ſaint Gillian: which is ſaid to be ten times worſe then the diuels.
            Treaſon, treaſon, my Lords, quoth Octauius, if I haue ſpoken hereſie, this queſtionleſſe is no better then treaſon, and the compariſon ſo odious as may not be endured, (the diuell and a woman ioyned in one) as fit a match as may be made. Well my Lord, ſince in my errour I haue found you kinde in fauouring my fault, let vs do as all bribing Officers vſe, beare with me, and ile hold with thée: ſo by conſealing my fault, the leſſe dangers ſhall happen vnto you; if you refuſe my kind offer, I come vpon you with an old prouerbe (ka me) (ka thée) or as children play, (tell of me, Ile tell of thée). Well watcht my Lord Octauius, quoth the whole company, but my Lords, let the further hearing of this matter reſt, till better opportunitie, leaſt your tediouſneſſe, bréed trouble to my Lord the Prince, whoſe quiet, I would not willingly offend.
            My honorable Lords anſwered the Prince, if theſe diſcourſes of thoſe noble men be pleaſing to your honours, aſſure you, they are no way offenſiue vnto me, I haue troubled you from your better cheare, to accept of a ſicke mans pittance, whereunto you are all ſo heartily welcome as to your owne Pallaces, (and welcome) ſaith our Countrey houſholders, is the beſt diſh, at their feaſts: if therefore my Lords you accept my welcome, I am the more honoured by you, which haue ſo graciouſly vouchſafed me your companies.
            Then turning to the Lord Cariolus, he ſaid, for you my good Lord, how much I acknowledge my ſelfe indebted to you, I omit, and yéeld you as many thouſands thankes for your pleaſing ſpéech, as there were ſillibles in your words▪ you haue like your ſelfe defended the weaker ſexe, for the which, were I the Princes Nutania, your challendge made in my cauſe, ſhould be bountifully rewarded: I am ſory my good Lord, my bad hap was ſuch, that I knew you no ſooner.

But if it ſhall ſtand with your Lordſhips pleaſure, that during the time of your abode here, to vouchſafe me your company, ſo it may be no diſparagement to your ſerious affairs: perſwade your ſelfe, your welcome▪ ſhall be no better in anyplace, then vnto me, for which kindneſſe, you ſhould hinde me vnto your friendſhip.
            Gratious Prince anſwered the Noble Cariolus, thanks for your Princely fauour, and gracing me thus, which am not any way to do your maieſtie ſeruice, but wherein your highneſſe ſhall commaund, I ſhall be readie with all dutifulneſſe to accompliſh.
            Leaue theſe ſpéeches good my Lord, quoth the Prince, and offering dutie where friendſhip is requeſted, and granting my ſute, let me enioy thy companie, ſo ſhalt thou command Dionicus, for euer as a friend.
            The grauer ſort of thoſe Noble ſtrangers, whom matters of more importance called away, after humble thanks giuen for their royall entertainment, wiſhing health and all happineſſe vnto his excellence, they commit him to his reſt.

               Dionicus, whoſe heart was on his halfpennie, vowing his loue whollie to the Princeſſe Nutania, was ſo delighted in recounting hee praiſe, as nothing could be ſo pleaſing, but as all ſorts of men infected with that ag

the minde, as by this Prince notably appeared: who in his idle thoughtes, calling to minde the praiſes of Cariolus, and the challenge made in defence of the Princeſſe Nutania, as loue endureth no arriual, ſo Dionicus ſtriken wtih the ſting of ielouſie, began to conceiue manie vnhonourable thoughtes of Cariolus, ſuppoſing Nutania was was his Loue, and that by Cariolus his ioyes in her loue, and hope of fauour, ſhould bee fruſtrate and of no account: with much matter more, then euer was by Cariolus imagined▪ how largely ſo euer his ſpéech was vſed in the Princes behalfe, to procure their delights, and mooue Octauius to chollor: notwithſtanding no reaſon might perſwade, where iealouſie had giuen iudgemēt, for the Prince in this ielouſie, fought no meane, but reuenge of him that neuer committed the leaſt thought of euill againſt him. When reuenge in this Princes heart was thus imprinted, and rage and ielouſie ſet downe his death, an honourable motion, more befitting his grace then rigor, moued by the inſpiration of the eternal God, withdrew him from this baſe attempt, he called to mind, the honour of his houſe, the loue of thoſe Princes their bordering neighbors, by whoſe command, Cariolus came into his Country, the Scandall ſo bloodie a fact deſerued, & what continuall ignomy would redownd vnto him and his progeny for euer: accuſing himſelfe of great impietie, he exclaimed on his follies in this maner.
            Bluſh Dionicus, at thy baſe thoughts, and ſo much ſorrow for thy pretended miſchiefe, againſt this noble ſtraunger, as if thou hadſt ſhed the bloud of a thouſand innocents: haſt thou from thy Cradle diſdained to offer wrong to the moſt inferiour, and wilt now begin with murther of a noble man? Knoweſt thou not, that to adde to his head one haire, is more then the greateſt Prince can doo? And wilt thou ſéeke his life that neuer had thought of il againſt thée? Hath thy father liued ſo many yeares honourably reputed amōgſt them, euer in tranquilitie, and by thy cruel ſlaughtering

thy friend, ſhall their peace be broken? Was it not for his comfort and thy good, theſe ſtrangers came into this country? and for their kindneſſe, canſt thou reward them with ſuch deſpight? Thou enuieſt the happineſſe of a toward gentleman, for thou knoweſt not what, (ſay he loued the Princeſſe) what is that to thée, intreſt haſt thou none, to debarre him from it. Nutania thou knoweſt not but by heareſay, hée a Noble man of her country, a toward Gentleman, and woorthily may obtaine her. Nature hath made him of the mould of the earth, whereof thou art framed, the begger is as ſubiect to amorous paſſions as the prince. Nutania is beautifull, wiſe, faire, and in the principall time of her flouriſhing eſtate, louely as the dewe on the ſwéete Roſes. Cariolus valiant, well featured, wiſe and toward, in all honorable actions; all which are load-ſtarres to draw ladies to loue: and Nutania is but a woman though a princeſſe. If then thou haſt neither feare of God, or lawe of humanity to perſwade thée from ſo great a miſchiefe, yet let his kindneſſe offered thée, which hath bene as much as euer thou requiredſt, be of ſome regarde. The fierceſt beaſt ſeldome harmeth thoſe whoſe ſocietie they vſe, and wilt thou be found more cruel then vnnreaſonable creatures: No, no, Dionicus, let die thy malice to Cariolus, who is innocent, and far from any thought of pretended euill againſt thée, for ſo much the more ſhall his blood with extremitie be reuenged, by how much the more, thou vniuſtlie iniurieſt him, yea rather chooſe to die a thouſand deaths, if euerie life were a legion of liues, then holde ſo baſe a minde. Thou haſt long (though to thy great griefe) and much ſorrow concealed thy loue to Nutania, & now wilt thou murther him that wiſheth thée wel: for her loue.
            No, no, Dionicus, let honor be the marke whereat thou aimeſt, account death more precious then life with ignominie, honour by murther blemiſhed, is ſuch a ſtaine as can neuer be raced out, but the continuall ignomine thereof, will remaine while there is any being: Yea, and what

is more to bee regarded, the welfare of thy ſubiectes on whom the bloud of ſo noble a man wil be with great effuſion reuenged, & thy country like thoſe ruinous monuments of Troy laid waſte and deſolate, which was ſpoyled for a fact nothing ſo odious.
            Sithence thou haſt all theſe reaſons to reduce thée from this vile thought, dally no longer with thy ſhadowe, as in the tale of Eſope thou maiſt read, of y• dog; who mooued with enuie, of anothers welfare, not only hazarded his life, but what els he had in poſſeſſion. Though the compariſon bée ridiculous, yet the example may mooue thee to feare thine owne fall. For if the goddes be ſo iuſt in puniſhing ſuch offences in vnreaſonable creatures, howe much more ſhalt thou bée plagued, whom God hath not onley endued with reaſon, but inueſted with titles of maieſtie and honour; whoſe life ſhould ſhine on the earth, as the glorious Sun, and by thy vertues drawe ſuch as liue vnder thy gouernmēt, from their deſire to commit euil; for ſuch as is the Paſtor, ſuch will be the flocke: if the Prince bee vertuous, the Subiect will feare to offende, if hée bee vicious, who will care to liue in obedience of him, or his lawes. Thou ſéeſt Dionicus, the peril, ſurceaſe therfore thy baſe thoughts (and as Cariolus is Noble,) where thou haſt without deſert bene iealous, become zealous from enuying him, that no way wiſhed thée euill; admit him to thy friendſhip, to him thy kindneſſe may be acceptable, and in vſing ſuch fauours, maiſt thou in time learne the trueth of what thou now ſuppoſeſt. If Cariolus loue Nutania, he cannot be ſo ſecrete, but in ſome ſort or other, thou ſhalt attaine to the knowledge thereof: and as thou ſhalt in conuerſing with him, finde his Honourable dealinges, ſo maiſt thou either truſt him or refuſe him: If Nutania haue vowed her loue vnto him, ſéeke to maſter thy affection, and wiſh them ioy, if not, his friendſhippe may the ſooner bring thée to thy deſires, by acquainting the Princeſſe with thy loue, in explaining the paſſions for her thou haſt indured.
            
               
               Nutania (ſaith the wrolds report) is beautifull, wiſe, and honorablie demeaned, and therfore cannot be cruell: her father a king beloued of all y• haue heard of him, whoſe kindnes hath bin ſuch to thy father & thée, as thou canſt not deſerue: if ſuch loue remain in the parents, the children ſhuld not hate: then fondling, if thou haſt wronged thy ſelfe in concealing thy grief, accuſe thy owne follies; and condemne not thy friends of euil, nor let thy iealoſie blame Cariolus, who neuer had thought of pretēded euil againſt thée; if thou faile in thy loue, blame none but thy ſelfe, ſpare to ſpeake, ſpare to ſpéed; Cowards neuer were Loues champions, nor faint-hearted ſwad obtained Ladies loue: women though neuer ſo baſe, wil be ſued, ſought, and courted, with manie deuiſes allured to win them, and their loues obtained, as ſundry means ſought to continue it.
            A Nouice art thou Dionicus, and neuer came to knowe what many a hardy man at armes hath endured, hiſtories are diuers, which ſhewe the extreames of Princes and famous Conquerors, that they endured through loue, yet haſt thou neuer read of any that euer wooed by ſilence, courted their miſtreſſes with imaginations, or obtained their loue being mute: Longer maiſt thou ſmother thy griefe, which may cureles, conſume thée: fire ſuppreſſed, burneth wt more vehemencie, and loue concealed, conſumeth the intrals, and ſlayeth remedileſſe. How long may thy ſhoo wring thy foot, before any that looke thée in the face can tell where it pincheth thée. Many of meane birth haue obtained the loue of Princes, and ladies of great woorth, & by daring to attempt wedded and bedded them. If the ignoble haue had ſuch ſucceſſe in loue, Rouſe thée daſtard from this loathſome cabinet, arme thée with hopes of thy Miſtreſſe fauour, and with courage ſéek to obtaine it: let griefe no longer oppreſſe thée, but like the ſonne of thy renowned father, ſhew thy ſelf; let not daring loue, which by many good motions may bée vanquiſhed, ouerthrow thée by ſubiecting thy ſelfe ouermuch vnto it, but in the face of the enemie ſhewe thy ſelfe, and

there by proweſſe purchaſe ſuch renowne, as the report of thy valour may gaine thée the loue of her thou moſt deſireſt. Womens loues for the moſt are ſetled on the valiant and ſuch as aduenture, holding in rgarde ſuch as by their valour, can and will maintaine their honours, bearing in triumph their fauours in the field, and gaining honour in their titles. I, thus Dionicus ſhould be thy thoughts, holde thée there, and no doubt of good ſucceſſe: Nutania is but a woman though a Princeſſe, thou ſonne to a King, and no way her inferiour. Then continue this reſolution and Nutania may in time, aſwell ſéeke thy fauour, as the noble Amozonia, Alexanders loue.
            Scantly had hée ended this his tedious premeditation, when worde was brought vnto him by one of his Pages, that the Lorde Cariolus was come to viſite him, which did put him from all further imaginations at that time.
            
               Cariolus no ſooner come to his preſence, but Dionicus with a bluſhing countenance bad him welcome, aſhamed of his raſh ſuſpition; yet concealing the ſame as he might, framed ſuch kinde ſpéech as he beſt coulde, the better to aſſure his welcome, not ſparing oftentimes to render great and hartie thankes for his kindneſſe in comming to viſite him: and more to ſhewe how glad hée was of his companie, hée called to riſe, which he had not done long before, but for neceſſitie making his bed. Thus when long time was ſpent betweene them, diſcourſing of manie matters, to both their contentes, Dionicus called for meat; where to accompanie Cariolus, he receiued more ſuſtenance than he had in manie dayes before, to the great ioy of his attendant Barnardine, who by meſſengers certified the King and Quéene thereof, who ioyed, and were not a little comforted at this report.
            Dinner ended, & Cariolus with the Prince deuiſing to beguild ye time, loth ſuddenly to leaue him, called for a Chéſſe boord, wherwith they ſported a while, Dionicus, whō griefe

of minde procured ſoone to melancholy, looſing two or thrée faire games, became verie impacient, to agrauate whoſe chollor, and make his furie the more, Cariolus playing for cunning, to make game, tooke his quéene, and gaue checke to his king, whereat the Prince forgetting both himſelfe and other thoſe motions ſo lately by him minded, firſt violently ſtriking him with the board, ranne fiercely on him: and taking him by the throate, cried mainly out thus; Villaine quoth he, ſhameſt thou not to robbe me of my Ladie, my Loue, my life, and ſoules comfort, but to my téeth muſt check me therewith in my owne Country, (baſe fugitiue) thou ſhalt beard me no more therewith, for by thy miſerable death, will I recouer to mine owne poſſeſſion, my loue, my Ladie, my Quéene, yea in deſpight of thy head, Nutania ſhall be my miſtreſſe, ſwéete Princeſſe, the onely ſoueraign of my thoughts.
            
               Barnardine, and his Noble attendants, ſéeing this friendſhip lately profeſt, ſo ſuddeinly forgotten, taking him with much adoo from Cariolus, were not a little perplexed, but as men paſt themſelues, hauing neuer ſéene the like, could imagine no cauſe, greatly doubting that ſuddeinly he was growne lunaticke.
            
               Cariolus vexed at this hard vſage of the Prince, was no ſooner freed from him, but in great chollor would haue departed; Proteſting to be reuenged for this diſcurteſie offered him. Affrming, that his entiſing ſpéeches, in cullour of kindneſſe, was to no end, but to draw him from his honorable friends to murther him.
            
               Barnardine carefull what might enſue hereof, weighing each occaſion which might hereat be taken, beſought Cariolus, of that loue he beare the King his maiſter, which had vſed them honourablie, of his loue to his owne King, and all that might be imagined, to conceiue of this wrong offered, as of no ſuch pretended matter, as he ſuppoſed: but rather with patience to conſider the long extreame ſicknes of the Prince, and how ſubiect by reaſon of his infirmitie he

was vnto melancholy, vndertaking on his faith and honeſt reputation, how euer the occaſion grew, it was not in mallice: aſſuring him, the Prince when he ſhould call to mind this vnkind action, would with griefe lament it, and ſorrowing for the ſame, ſubmit himſelfe, crauing hearty forgiueneſſe for his raſhneſſe.
            
               Barnardine vexed at the heart, for this vnkind dealings of the Prince, entreating his aſſociates, to perſwade Cariolus, went himſelfe to the prince, and after dutiful ſpeach to his grace, recounted vnto him, in what euill part Cariolus tooke this abuſe by him offered: humbly beſéeching him, as he eſtéemed the loue of his Princely father, and the honour & reputation of his country, to acknowledge in ſome curteous maner the wrong committed, and ſo reconcile himſelf.
            
               Dionicus, whoſe paſſion had not it left him, albeit in his health none might more perſwade him then Barnardine, yet hearing him preach repentance, being in this humour, forgate their paſſed friendſhip, and moued with his talke, albeit it was vſed for his good, with a looke as gaſtly, as a ghoaſt riſen from the graue, drew neare Barnardine, and laying hands on him, had like to haue miſchieued him, had he not made the more ſpéed away.
            
               Cariolus vnderſtanding what had bene offred the aged man, and hearing in what regard the Prince held his loue, paſſing by his chollor, began with great heauineſſe to lament the Prince his agonie, and ſorrowing for him, beſought the heauens creature ſo to comfort the Prince as himſelfe would wiſh in the like extreame. And ſo leauing Barnardine and the Nobles to their charge, departed.
            The Nobles whoſe griefe was not little, with hearts ouer charged with ſorrow, thinking it not conuenient to leaue him alone, doubting ſom worſe matter ſhuld happen vnto him, went to viſit the Prince chéerfully, enquiring of his welfare, which with ſo good countenances as he could vſe, was kindly anſwered of the Prince: who hauing paſt the extremitie of his fury, calling to minde thoſe notable

abuſes offred his friends, greatly lamenting his folly therin, he ſaid:
            Where, where, my honourable friends, may I hide my head, to ſhelter me from the worlds reproach, who voyd of all reaſon, more brutiſh then the ſauage beaſt, haue ſought to murder my deareſt friends. Oh, how might (I bluſh with ſhame,) and aſhamed of my euill committed, neuer behold the faces of thoſe whom I haue ſo euill entreated: what fury bewitched me to this miſchiefe? Or what diuelliſh ſorcery enchanted my ſpirits, and captiuated my ſences, ſo to offend thée Lord Cariolus? who of thy zealous affection and curteſie, came to viſit me, delighting ſo greatly in thy company as I did. And thou the father of grauitie, my greateſt hope in the world, Barnardine, thou whoſe honeſt care and loue to me, hath bene euer ſhowne from my Cradle. Oh Barnardine, how vngratefull haue I bene, rewarding thy good, with the hazard of thy blood. Woe is me vnhappie, and thriſe vnhappie, that I haue liued to behold the light of this day, wherein paſt my ſelf, I haue ſo highly offended. Pardon, pardon, my Lord Cariolus, as thou art honorable, and thou Barnardine, whoſe aged yeares I haue ſo highly offended: Forgiue my miſſe, and remit that euill I haue committed againſt thée, or let me neuer behold the dayes light againe. Why ſhould I liue, whom mine owne conſcience ſo highly accuſeth of ſuch impietie? Will not the fowles of the aire, ſoaring ouer thy head as thou walkeſt, cry out, (vngrateful Dionicus) that wouldeſt haue murdred thy frends: each creature that God hath made, wil exclaime againſt thée, for this euill, following thée with cries of horror, to thy euerlaſting reproach. Therefore vnhappie Dionius, ſince by thy owne doings this reproach is happened vpon thée, whereby for euer thou art diſhonoured, and no man hereafter will dare to vſe any familiaritie with thée, no not one, from the Prince to the begger, (liue not, liue not thou Dionicus,) but let that hand that committed the euill, finiſh thy life, which liuing, can neuer be vnremembred.

In this furie, reſoluing to haue miſchiefed himſelfe, his Nobles taking him in their Armes, with ſuch comfortable ſpéeches as they could, pacified him, who ſéeing his ſorowfulneſſe, were partakers of his grief, and much lamented his extremitie, as men might for their Soueraign. Yet caſting of care, ſeeking the beſt for their quiet they could, they laid him in his bed, where, with ſolemne muſicke they procured him to ſléepe. Where for a time I leaue him.
            Time that finiſheth all things, hath now wrought an end of the Kings affaires, for the diſpatch of the Embaſſadors, whome the King with great entertainment and Iewels of high eſtéeme, ſo rewarded, as they all had cauſe to ſpeake of his royall bountie. The Embaſſadors receiuing their Letters, and the time appointed for their departure, their ſhips with victuals at the Kings coſt repleniſhed, and all other neceſſaries, Cariolus who had bene often ſolicited by Barnardine, to viſit the Prince, and by his report whoſe word was of account with all that had knowledge of his ſimple dealings, was perſwaded of the Princes ſorrow, for the wrong offered him. Wherefore that it might appeare vnto Dionicus, he departed not in diſpleaſure, but that he had forgotten all wrongs offered, kindly, before his departure, came to take his leaue. Where, vpon the curteous demeanour of the Prince, who manifeſted his griefe by the aboundance of ſighes which he powred foorth, they were reconciled, and an inuiolably league of friendſhip vowed betwéene them: which with ſolemne oathes they proteſted, ſhould neuer quaile in either of them.
            The haſt of the noble Embaſſadors who deſired to be with their Loues at home, is more now then Cariolus wiſhed: But what muſt be, ſhall be, how loth ſoeuer. Wherefore after many friendly gratulations betwéene them, and great gifts of the Prince, on his new (Amico) beſtowed, they take leaue each of other, Cariolus ſolemnely praying for the Princes health, and Dionicus wiſhing him all happineſſe.
            Thus all thinges fitted by the King commaund, they

were honourably conducted vnto the Porte, where their ſhippes readie furniſhed, attended their comming: where they had not long ſtayed, but a faire winde to ſerue their turnes, God ſent them; and they embarqued themſelues, each one for his ſeuerall country, and the Nobles returned to the Court; where to their carefull regard of their king, Countries benefite, we leaue them, to let you knowe further of the Prince; whoſe is troubled, as you ſhall heare.
            The Prince, whom Nature had formed ſo exquiſite in lineaments of body, as could be required, hauing wiſdome and valour enferiour to none, when he had conſidered with great wiſdome from poynt to point, the extremitie of his eſtate, and found that his diſeaſe was grieuous, and ſo great, that he rather deſired death, than life, in that agonie to bée continued; weying all dangers which might befall him, in ſéeking ſecretly for ſuch helpe, as by his owne induſtrie he could procure: with the pleaſures and hearts content, the obtaining of his loues delight, would bring him; reſolutelie determined, as much as he might, to cheriſh himſelfe: and diſguiſing himſelf in habite of a traueller, vnknowne of any man, ſo ſoone as his ſtrength would permit him, hée departed his Countrie towards Thrace, and either gaine his Ladie, or trie in ſhorte time the fickleneſſe of fortune: hazarding all on this reſt, he ſecretely procureth all his Iewels, and ſuch ſummes of money as hée coulde: and by little and little recouering himſelfe, vſed his woonted familiarity amongſt the Nobles, and Courtiours; which did cauſe no ſmall content and heartes ioye in the King, Quéene and Commons; yea, ſuch was the generall reioycing of the whole people in the Realme, for his recouery, that there▪ was not one, which ſhewed not ſome ſigne of gladnes by his outward appearance.
            As there is not the cleareſt day which is not ouerwhelmed with ſome cloud, ſo laſted this ioy amongſt theſe louing ſubiects not long: for Dionicus continuing his determination, cōueyed his ſummes of mony and Iewels into a

groue within the Parke neare the Court, at ſuch ſeuerall times as he would chuſe to be ſolitarie, wrought ſo cloſe, and with ſuch diſcretion, that he was altogither vnperceiued of any man.
            Each thing wrought to his content, ſecretly in the euening, his companions by him appointed to kéep the Courtiers from idleneſſe, by ſuch paſtimes as he had deuiſed, as Maſking, Barriors, Dycing, and other recreations, whom he refuſed to accompanie, alleaging that he might not be long abſent from the King, and that his ſport determined, was to recreate the Quéene, who ſince her ſickneſſe was verie melancholie, which coyned excuſe paſſed for currant, as what was it they would not credit which hée ſhould report.
            Hauing thus politikely fitted all things, ſupper ended, and euerie one attending the beginning of the ſportes and paſtimes, Dionicus who had more ſtringes to his Harpe then one, had no care but how to conuey himſelfe from their preſence, which hée tooke opportunitie to doo, telling the Quéene mother hée had giuen his word to be one of the Maſkers, which ſhée being glad of, as reioycing to remooue his melancholy by anie meanes, ſuffered him to depart.
            But too ſoone alas, gaue ſhée credite to his feined ſpéeches, which turned them all to great ſorrow and heauineſſe: for Dionicus minding leaſt what they ſuppoſed he moſt ioyed in, conueyed himſelfe with all the haſt he poſſibly could into the Parke, where his footeman attended his comming with his horſe, on which hée was no ſooner mounted, to driue ſuſpition or iealous thoughts of his late trauaile from his man, hée commaunded him preſently, to ſpéede him with all the haſte he might, vnto the houſe of a Knight dwelling not farre off, with a deuiſed meſſage, pretending the buſineſſe to be of great waight and importaunce, and ſtraightly charging him not to depart from thence before his comming, which ſhould be the

next night. With this commaundement the ſeruaunt departed, leaſt ſuſpecting the loſſe of ſo bountifull a maiſter was ſo neare. But the Prince whoſe chiefeſt content was in beholding the Idia of that Paragon whom Fame had ſo extolled, had his heart fired with deſire, that he thought euerie day a yeare, and euerie minute a moneth, vntill hée beheld the excellencie of Natures worke, the onely performed worke of Bewtie, and the ſoueraigne goddeſſe of his thoughts: of which Dionicus hauing no ſmall regard, doubting to be miſſed of the King, and loth to loſe that opportunitie, poaſteth with all ſpéed vnto the groue where his coyne and Iewels laie, where the better to eſcape the ſuſpition of Officers in his paſſage, croſſing the ſeas, he attired himſelfe in the habit of a marchant, which he had readie prouided for that purpoſe: and ſo making ſmall ſtaie, he ceaſeth not his coriours pace, nor ſpareth any horſ fleſh, vntil he came to the port where he pretended to imbarke him ſelfe. No ſooner arriued he at that ſo long deſired place, but Fortune who had bent his thoughts to trauaile, entending after her many croſſes to ſauce his ſowre with ſome ſwéets, and like a comfortable Phiſition, after many bitter Pilles miniſtred for cloying the ſtomacke of his Patient, comforteth him with ſome conſarue or other more pleaſing his appetite, ſo the Prince now in the beginning of his fortunes, found this fauour, to arme him with the better hope of enſuing good: for at his firſt comming to the Citie, after enquiry made for ſome ſhip bound for Thrace, he had intelligence of a Barke alreadie haled out of the harbourgh into the roade, her yardes croſſed, and her Marriners exſpecting the comming a boord of the maiſter and her marchaunts, and ſo to depart. Which newes how pleaſing it was to the prince, ſuppoſe you gentils, that haue your harts ſo full fraught with deſire as this noble Dionicus, who no ſooner was informed hereof, but diligently went himſelfe to ſearch the maiſter & marchants of this ſhip, whō he found in an Oſtria, carowſing healthes to their good voyage, and

taking leaue of their friends in the citie: to whoſe company the Prince being come; albeit nothing acquainted with the conditions of thoſe people, yet he ſo framed his behauiour to his habit, that it might haue bene admired amongſt the Courtiers, his quaint behauiour, had they bene beholders thereof; pleaſing ſo well theſe humorous companions with his carowſing, curteſie, and bountifull expences, that nothing he could require was denyed him. A woonder it were to tell you, whē he required paſſage, with what willingnes they graunted it, and what large proffers were made him of their cabbins, and other ſea curteſies: all which he accepted with ſuch kindneſſe, and none more welcome than Dionicus; who ſtanding on thornes to be cleare of his land, whō loue enforced without regard of father, crowne, or ſubiects, to leaue, he haſteneth the reſt aboord: of whoſe company the Mariners were not a litle ioyfull, for y• the wind ſerued thē in ſuch pleaſing maner, to bring thē to their deſired hauen, whither (following the Maſters direction for their courſe, ſailing with a faire gale, we leaue them for a time, to tell you of the griefe of Manpelius, the Numedian king, for the loſſe of his ſon, of whom no maner of news might be heard.
            You haue heard Gentles, with what pollicie the prince wrought, the better to bring his purpoſed intent to paſſe, and what ſeuerall paſtimes, were by him deuiſed: in which ſeuerall actions, it was ſuppoſed by the Courtiers, himſelf would haue bene a chiefe, or at leaſt, a beholder of their ſportes. But hée which had more hammers working in his brains than one; taking that time as fitteſt for his opportunity, gaue them a cauſe of great ſorrow, as you ſhall heare. Whoſe ſportes ended, and euerie thing with great credite to the actors, and pleaſure to the beholders finiſhed, the King and Quéene, whome age nowe called to reſt, after kinde countenances, and manie thanks to the Noble men & Gentiles, bad thē good night, who were in all humblenes and heartie loue cōmended to their reſts, wher let thē reſt, vntil the newes of their ſons departure be brought them,

by the wofull Barnardine, whoſe hearts ſurcharged with ſorrow, could hardly be comforted, but that through the extremitie of his griefe, he had reſigned his lateſt gaſpe to him who firſt gaue him breath.
            This wofull newes was two whole dayes and more kept from the king, by that mirrour of fidelitie Barnardine, who by all meanes either Art or trauell could imagine, enquired after the Prince, but of him could heare no tydings, whereby many ſuppoſed hee was ſlaine: ſome coniectured one thing, ſome another. But moſt of al the King & Quéen, their happineſſe was ſuch as may not without great effuſion of teares be remembred, which cauſed a generall griefe throughout the whole Regiment. But neither ſorrow of the ſubiects, nor lamentation of their King, might recall him who they all ſo much deſired to ſée, which cauſed the King ouercharged with melancholy, rather deſiring death then life, breathe out theſe ſpéeches.
            Vnhappie (Manpelius) and more vnhappie, in being father to ſo graceleſſe a childe, (oh Dionicus) why haue I liued to ſée thée growne a man? tenderly caring to bring thée to that eſtate? and now my chiefeſt hope was in thée to haue comfort, thus by thy vnkind demeanour, to cauſe my grief: how happie be thoſe parents whoſe children liue in obedience; but thriſe accurſed thoſe fathers which giueth ye bridle of youth into their hands, who ought to be held in, as the Colt vntamed, with the hardeſt bit. Though wiſedome preſageth lawes of gouernment to fathers, and experience of the Auncient which haue liued in elder times giueth aduiſe, crying out of ſuch as giueth libertie to yonglings, yet law of nature whereunto we vnhappie parents are too much tyed, forgetting all counſels, are ſo beſotted on thoſe careleſſe yonglings, that if they deſire any thing, whether it be profitable for their inſtruction, or haleth them to deſtruction, it may not be denied them: how many of high eſtate by the careleſſe regarde of their vntoward children, haue bene brought to great heauineſſe? Or who taking

pleaſure in his ofſpring, can ſée him reſtrained, (I but vnhappie man) haſt thou not heard the learned Surgion often tell his tender Patient, that it is better to ſmart once, then endure griefe euer. And thou that mighteſt haue kept thy deare ſonne vnder his Tutors cuſtodie, wherein he liued in obedience, might ſo haue had him ſtill, if thy owns fooliſhneſſe had not bene ſo careleſſe of him. Then ſince thou haſt bene the cauſe of thine owne ſorrow, blame thy ſelfe, and ſigh to think on thy follies: and as thou haſt bene the originall of this miſchiefe, not onely robbing thy countrey of a towarde braunch to ſuccéede thée, but haſt loſt to thy ſelfe the ioy of a father, in wanting thy ſonne, thy lifes ſole happineſſe. Perſwade thée, that as many Countries haue bene puniſhed for the Princes offences, ſo this plague is laide vppon thy ſubiects for thy miſſe. Wherefore in ſorrowing for thy ſinnes, and that God may ſhewe his mercy vpon thy kinde Countrey men, ſorrow for thy foppery, and abiuring thy▪ ſelfe from kingdome, wife, and Countrey, betake thée to ſome vnknowne place, where thou maieſt ſpende the remainder of thy ouer worne yeares, in contemplation for thy ſinnes, ſo may that God of all mercie, which neuer turneth his face from the penitent, receiue thée to his grace, and reſtore thy ſonne, calling him from his youthfull deſires, to become a comfort vnto thoſe which with manie fault teares, and hearts full gorged with ſorrow, bewayle his abſence. Thus powring foorth his griefe with ſighes and manie briniſh teares, vttering his ſorrow, hée reſolued to leaue all his earthly poſſeſſions, and altogither forſaking the companie of all mankinde, liue ſollitarie in ſome vnfrequented place, vntill it woulde pleaſe God ſome tydings ſhould be ſent him of his ſonne, or elſe by death call him to thoſe ioyes which neuer ſhall haue ende. Thus for this time he ended his ſorrowfull ſpéech, vttered in great griefe of minde, whome carefull for to eſpie time and opportunitie fit for his departure, we leaue for a time. And ſhall tell you further of the

Prince Dionicus, who long before this time, is arriued in Thrace.
            
            The Prince whome deſire ledde to gaine the loue of Nutania, not otherwiſe knowne but for a marchant, landed now in ſafetie, after a friendly welcome giuen to his fellow paſſengers, the Maiſter and Owners, with bountifull rewardes beſtowed on the Marriners, was lodged by the Maiſter in a Marchants houſe of great reputation, where vnknowne to be any other then he ſéemed, he imployed his ſtocke by Brokers, to great benefite, whiche bountifully hée ſpent, whereby he gained the loue of all men that euer had any acquaintance with him, ſo that in ſhort time his fame was ſo bruted throughout the Cittie, that none of anie account, but tooke great pleaſure in his company, and ioyed to recount his many vertues. This amorous Prince whoſe heart was on his halfepenny, loth to acquaint any man with his ſecret loue to the Princes, doubting ſome further perill to his perſon then hée was willing to hazard, would oftentimes intrude himſelfe into the companie of yoong Courtiers, amongſt whome hée ſo demeaned himſelfe, and ſo Courtly in all thinges, that all men might iudge from what trée ſuch branches ſprung. By this often frequenting of the Court, in the companie of thoſe to whome he was moſt welcome, hée atteined the ſight of his Ladie, whoſe beautie, when he had ſéene, ſo amazed him, that if he were before paſſionate, he was now more perplexed, iudging her excellent perfection to bee without compare, yet not knowing how to make knowne his loue vnto her, ſmothering in ſilence his affection, hée daily deſired ſome occaſion might be offered, wherein for her ſafetie, and honour of his beloued, he might ſhew ſome act worthie honour, and to deſerue her liking, which by Fortunes aſſiſtaunce thus happily came to paſſe.
            
               Muſtopha Corienia, yongeſt ſonne to Sutton Corienia, Emperour of Conſtantinople, burning in loue of this

Princeſſe, onely by the rare report of her ſingular perfections, had by Embaſſadors from his father, craued the Princeſſe in marriage, who diſdaining his loue being a Pagan, although honourable, might not be wonne by any entreatie to fancie him, how great ſoeuer his offers and proteſtations of loue were; which refuſall, the Prince brooked ſo ill, being of ſuch might, that determining to gaine her by force for his concubine, which in friendſhip he had ſo often required to marry, he leuied a power of one hundred thouſand, both on horſe and foote, and ſhipping them in warlike maner, in Gallies, Frigattes, Foyſtes, and Brigandioces, he arriued by the hard labour and painfull bowging of his ſlaues, before the Citie of Lemonia, where Philarchus kept his Court, landing the greateſt part of his men and horſe ſuddeinly, and beleagared the ſame, both by land and ſea: vnto which he gaue many fierce and hote aſſaults, & were as valiantly reſiſted, by the courage of thoſe gallant Cittizens, who fighting in right of their Countrey, feared not the hugeneſſe of their Armies, nor their force of ſhipping, yet as the extremes of forrain force cauſeth many troubles, ſo did the Army of Muſtapha, driue theſe braue Thracians to many wants, whoſe courage through the lacke of victualls began to quaile: that hauing no meane of reliefe neither by ſea nor land, loth to famiſh, came daily to the court, humbly beſéeching the King to take pittie of them, and not with famine to ſuffer them die. But conſidering that the Princeſſe was the marke whereat he aimed, would rather deliuer her, who ſhould be honourably entreated, then ſuffer ſo many thouſands to periſh.
            
               Philarchus, vexed in mind, was driuen to a non plus, ſo diuerſly perplexed, he could not ſuddeinly anſwer, his child who was his onely comfort and heire, either to be deliuered him, whoſe name was odious vnto him, or his ſubiects who loued him no leſſe then their owne ſoules, muſt periſh in this extreame. Thus doubtfull what to anſwere, he craued reſpite for two daies, which they willingly yéelded vnto,

albeit their want of victualles was ſo great they might hardly endure.
            The report of this dolefull ſute of the commons comming to the eares of Dionicus, who with his attire, wee change to Pheander, who was not a litle mooued there, and the greater was his heauineſſe by how much the more his loue was encreaſed towards the Princeſſe, for whoſe reléef he ſought many deuiſes, eftſoones determining one thing, then another preſents it ſelfe, which ſeemeth better: at length reſoluing leaſt delayes ſhould bréede danger, hée determined in that action which was honorable, to ſhew him ſelfe, and eyther by his proweſſe frée the King and his beloued from the tyranny of the vſurping Infidell, or yeeld his lateſt gaſpe in their defence.
            In this reſolution he came to the kings preſence, vnto whome doing his humble duty, prroſtrating himſelfe, he ſaith.
            Moſt gracious Soueraigne, and liege Lorde, pardon the bold attempt of a rude ſtranger, whome dutifull zeale hath bound to your ſeruice, and of your gracious fauour to all men, vouchſafe me that honour in this extreme, wherin your woorthy citizens ſtand, diſtreſſed by this faithleſſe infidell, who doeth ſéeke your ſubuerſion and their vtter decay: whoſe preſumption, if it pleaſe your Excellence to giue me leaue, ſhall by mée, and ſuch as I can by loue and money drawe vnto me, be chaſtened, and made to knowe your Highneſſe can expell at your pleaſure, the power of a more ſtrong and mightier enemie, who though you haue of curteſie ſuffered, it hath not bene of cowardize, as hée ſhall well vnderſtande. In this requeſt, moſt gracious and renowmed Soueraigne, if it ſhall pleaſe you to honor me, I doubt not (by the ayd of the higheſt) of a happie victorie.
            The King, which during his long tale, had earneſtlie noted the countenance, and his grace in vttering the ſame, aſſured himſelf, that the honour of his houſe, which ſhewed

in his courage, or the power of the eternal Deity wrought this motion in him, and therefore without any longer pauſe, taking him curteouſlie from his knées, determining to trie the fortunes of this ſuppoſed Merchant, hee ſaith.
            What euer thou be that honor vrgeth to this attempt, thankes for thy loue, wiſhing my good, and forwardneſſe in venturing thy life, yet before I accept thée for my Champion, ſay (gentle friend) of what countrey art thou? what name and parentage? to the ende that I may giue thée honour as thy deſertes and bloud do require: and anſwering me truely to theſe demaundes, tell me what mooued thée likewiſe, being ſo braue a man, and in thy flouriſhing eſtate, to hazard thy ſelfe in an action, wherein ſo many men of honour and great valour haue loſt their liues.
            Know renowmed Lord (quoth the Prince) Numedia is my countrie, my father a Gentleman profeſſing martiall Diſcipline, my name Pheander, the youngeſt of manie of my fathers ſonnes, vnto whom my minority denyed ſuch reuenewes and liuinges as might ſufficiently maintaine my eſtate, which cauſed me to employ my ſtock in trade of merchandize, by which in time of peace I gained in your countrie wealth ſufficient, which with my body I offer in your highneſſe ſeruice, and doubt not but to frée thy princely daughter from this vſurper, whoſe vertue the worlde ſo much renowneth for, by that faith which I receiued at the Font-ſtone, ſo long as I may breath life, neuer ſhal vnhalowed Cur, triumph in your Graces ouerthrow, nor in her diſhonor.
            The king ouer ioyed at theſe frank affaires of his champion, expreſſing by his outward ſignes, the inward delight of his heart, and the deſire he had to accept this yonglings offer, taking great pleaſure in his countenance, which was louelie, and no way inferiour to the beſt in his court for perſon, wiſedome, and other good graces, which with aduiſe conſidered, he ſaith.
            
               Pheander, wel doeſt thou ſhowe thy ſelfe a Gentleman,

for vnder the habit of a Merchant Gentilitie cannot be hid, no poore eſtate can blemiſh the Noble, nor aduerſe fortune whatſoeuer; but as golde is ſoone brought from the baſer mettels to his forme by the ſkilfull finer, ſo are the Noble knowne by their vertues. Pheander, I haue cauſe to honor thée for thy loue and forwardneſſe, as alſo for thy countrey; which (without ſlattering thée, or any ther abiding) I loue for your Kings ſake. But to our matter, thou ſéeſt (my déer Pheander) the millions of cares heaped vppon my gray head, through the oppreſſion of this heathen Prince, whereby I am made more miſerable than the meaneſt ſubiect in my dominions; and the more is my miſerie, by recounting the wretched eſtate of my louing ſubiects, whom I hold as deare as my life, and with that by reſigning my life and crowne, I might frée them from bondage, were it nothing els the tyrant required. But toward Gentleman, whoſe loue (wretch that I am,) I cannot requite, my daughter (oh ſorrow worſe thā death to recount) Nutania, the only ſolace of my life, and lines ſole good, in whoſe weal conſiſteth my good, & by violence offered her, what good can be tide me, ſhe: ſhe, my deare Pheander, it is that drencheth my ſoul into ſo déep a hel, that almoſt forgetting my ſelf, liuing, I dayly dy; only recounting the miſeries 
                  •
               he ſhould endure, if y• tyrant triumpht in our ouerthrow: but he that in extreams ſendeth comfort, hath reuiued me, & relieued my ouercharged hart by thy kind offer; whoſe courage and hope of victorie being ſuch, as thou wilt hazard thy déereſt blood for my daughters fréedom. Thanks (my good Pheander) is all that I can yet yéeld thée; yet t
                  •
               ad more courage to thy noble mind, fighting for vs & our honor, my daughter, for whoſe good thou aduentureſt, ſhall inueſt thée with the order of Knighthoode, the firſt honour that euer ſhe gaue to man of Armes, and ſhal pray for thy good ſucceſſe: ſo calling for the Princeſſe, who was ſo diſcontent that nothing could be pleaſing vnto her, who being come before him, after her humble dutie done, deſirous to knowe her kingly Fathers will, hée recounted

the zeale of the merchant vnto her, who had not onely offered his goods, but alſo his proper life, to trie in battel his fortunes againſt their enemie: wherefore Nutania, quoth the king, for that he hath ſo voluntarily offered the ſame for thy ſake, and I relying on my God, and in his prowes haue accepted him for my Champion, by thy hand he ſhall receiue the honour of knighthood, his title, The maiden Knight, and ſo proſper he in his honorable action, and in all others as we wiſh, and himſelfe deſireth.
            The Princeſſe, which diuers times had noted the courtlie behauiour of Dionicus, was not a little pleaſed at her fathers motion, as one that in hartie good wil, wiſhed him better then modeſtie would ſuffer her to vtter; yet harkening to her fathers ſpeaches, ſhee behelde him with more gracious countenaunce, and vewing the lineamentes of his perſon, each grace well regarded, ſhe inwardly bewailed his hard hap, that the goddes had framed him of no better reputation than a marchant, who might well deſerue the title of a king, put from her memento, by recounting her fathers wordes, pauſing thereon ſometime, with modeſt bluſhing countenance ſhe ſaid.
            Kind ſir, whoſe honorable ſeruice offered for my fathers good, and all our weales, his ſubiectes; if I yéelde you not ſuch recompence as your deſertes doe merit, blame me not of diſcourteſie, which haue no better knowledge of you, but accept the hartie thanks of a Virgin, vnto whome I holde my ſelfe ſo farre indebted, as I can no other way recompence, then wiſhing your good; yet in earneſt of better good, refuſe not at my hand to receiue the honour of Knighthood, ſéeing my Lords pleaſure is ſuch: and drawing his rapier, the Prince knéeling, ſhee inueſted him with the order, by name of the Maiden Knight, & pulling a iewell of rich price frō her gowne, ſhe tied the ſame in a moſt beautiful ſcarffe, beſéeching him to weare it for her ſake, wiſhing all happie fortune in his attempts.
            The new adopted Knight, whoſe heart ouer ioyed for ſo

great a fauour receiued from the ſaint his heart wholy honoured, with manie thankes dutifully rendered, kiſſed the Princeſſe hand, vowing himſelfe her humble ſeruant, and in all places to maintaine her modeſt bewtie & Princely honour, with his deareſt bloud.
            The time thus paſſed, word was brought the King, that dinner was readie, whereby they were interrupted, whome for a time we leaue to their repaſt, diſcourſing diuerſly at table, of the valour of the Mayden Knight, whoſe towardneſſe the King admired; which made his hopes the greater: not doubting but his Champion would proue no leſſe valiant in Armes then they exſpected. At which the Princeſſe gloried not a litle, and the Nobles pleaſed at both their comforts, paſſed the time with more content then many dayes before, whome we leaue to their mirth, and the Mayden Knight, to the ordering of his affaires.
            The Numedian King, exiling himſelfe from his Court, in habite of a Pilgrime, trauelled many vncouth places in ſearch for his ſonne, of whom he could hear no tidings, neither could Barnardine for all the induſtrie he could vſe, attaine to any knowledge of him his heart ſo much deſired: through which the heauines both of the Péeres & Comons, were daily increaſed. And no maruel, when their ſoueraign the mirror of all princely curteſie, had thus vnknowne, in the declining of his age, when his yeares required reſt, baniſhed himſelfe his countrey, louing ſubiects, and what elſe he enioyed: the griefe of which ſo oppreſſed the heart of the Quéene, that nothing might yéeld her any comfort. But pining in continuall ſorrow, vtterly abandoning the worlds comfort, to ſéeke her comforter, whoſe dwellings are in the higheſt heauens, ſhe yéelded her due to death, whoſe funerals, with the effuſion of many briniſh teares of the Nobles, and ſorrowfull lamentations of her ſubiects, was performed with ſuch honour as to her eſtate required: whoſe obſeques finiſhed, Barnardine regarding the benefit of the Common-weale, and the Princes good, of whom their hope

was to learne knowledge, vſed ſo kinde perſuaſions to the whole eſtate, in a parlement holden of purpoſe, that the regiment was deliuered by conſent, vnto ſixe of the chiefeſt nobles, who were ſolemnely ſworne to maintain the dignities of the Crowne, in abſence of the king & his ſonne, vnto whom, being lawfull heires to the ſame, they ſhuld reſigne their titles, whenſoeuer they ſhould chalenge ye ſame. Now Gentiles leaue we theſe diſtreſſed people, lamenting their kings abſence & the quéenes death, to tel you of the Maiden Knight.
            This gallant Prince, the hope of Thrace, carefull of his honor, & not vnmindful of his new miſtres, whoſe loue was the marke he aimed at, hoping by accompliſhing this victorie againſt the Souldane, to gaine that place of reputation with her that hée deſired: for the better accompliſhing of which, he proclaimed by ſound of Trumpet, that all ſuch as would in y• action aduenture their liues with him, ſhould bountifully be conſidered, all eſtates from the Cauileare, to the Mercenary, cauſed many to offer him their ſonnes, ſo that in ſhort time, he had gathered more able men thē euer in ſo ſmal warning were ſéene; ſuch was the loue his bountie had gained among all eſtates, that of their kindnes many repaired, more then for of money, although the thought therof is able to draw ye coward to fight, ſo highly was this ſtranger honored. The diligence was ſuch of this Prince, that in ſhort time he had his companies, which were ſo furniſhed, as he liued not in thoſe territories that euer ſaw the like. Al things furniſhed for the field, he became an earneſt ſutor to the Princeſſe his miſtreſſe, to procure the king to view his army, which with ſmal ſute ſhe obteined for him, gracing him with all the fauours ſhe might, more delighting in him then in all the men that euer ſhe ſaw. The time appointed for his muſter, after he had giuen directions to all ſuch Leaders & other Officers, what courſe to take with their ſeuerall charge, they were conducted to the place appointed by himſelf, who mounted on a ſtately Courſer, paſſed

on through the Citie, his Captaines attired in Gaſcoin coats of watchet veluet, hauing on the breaſt & back emboſſed with goldſmiths work, a Mayden head, according to his deuiſe on his armes, with the colour of his miſtreſſe ſcarfe: euery vnder officer in like ſutes of ſatten, his mercinary men in Iackets, hoſe and hats coloured alike, which cauſed the beholders, to admire the ſtranger more then their princes. When the king beheld this mirror of honor, leaſt thinking he was ſonne to his louing frend the Numedian king, and had with great delight viewed each ſeueral officer and their charge, with their order of march, and ranging in battell, all accompliſhed in ſuch warlike maner, as ſildome he had ſéen: and withall noted his perſon, with his brauery in armor, his gallant ſitting a horſe, and manuring the ſame, his charging, running, and other ſignes of enſuing good, giuing him great thanks, he cauſed him to diſmiſſe his companies for that time, to attend his pleaſure at the Court, which he cauſed ſuddeinly to be done, attending the kings pleaſure at the Court, as he was commanded: the newes of his arriuall being brought to the Princeſſe, who had ſéen with what coſt and rare deuiſes, each thing by her ſeruant was performed, iudging likewiſe his loue to her was ſome cauſe, by his cullours and deuiſes, willing to let him know how graciouſly the ſame was accepted, ſhe came into the Preſence, where finding her Knight, after ſhe had with a kinde and louing Conge ſaluted him, calling him to a baye Windowe, with a modeſt and comely grace ſhée ſaid:
            Syr, how much I finde my ſelfe indebted vnto you, for your preffered ſeruice, and forewardneſſe in performing the ſame, I will not ſay, that in time what wants in me to accompliſh, my kingly father wil recompence, who hath ſéene and well noted your diligence vſed for his ſafetie, with your coſt and great charge, which he wil not forget. In the meane time good ſeruant, for ſo I will hencefoorth call you, ſo you will vouchſafe to accept of the tytle;

I will pray for your good ſucceſſe and happie victory, wherby your renowne may paſſe the fartheſt parts of the earth, and our Country by your proweſſe deliuered from heathen thraldome.
            Vertuous Princeſſe anſwered the Mayden Knight, might it pleaſe your exellence to conceiue of my well meaning, as my deſire is to deſerue, my fortune might be compared with the happieſt that liueth. For on the faith of a Souldier, and by the Maieſtie of that ſaint my heart moſt adoreth, there is none breathing life vnder the celeſtiall globe, that ſhall commaund the ſimple ſeruice of Pheander, but your Maieſtie, bound thereunto by your Princely fauours. Inough my good ſeruant, quoth the Princeſſe, I take your word, hauing great cauſe to beléeue you, ſéeing your forwardneſſe: But good ſeruant, if I might vnder Benedicitie, know the ſaint vnto whom your deuotions are bent, I would be ſo bolde to offer a virgines prayer at her ſhrine for your good ſucceſſe. The King ouer hearing their talke, brake them off thus.
            How now Madame, what haue you that Gentleman at ſhrift, (if ſo) and that his confection deſerue a ſharpe pennance, yet be good to him, he may in time amend.
            Your grace (quoth the Princeſſe) miſtakes your ſelfe, your highneſſe knoweth I neuer tooke orders, therfore my authoritie is not to abſolue, and if by preſumption I offend therein, I doubt the Fathers of our Church would reward me thereafter. But to let your maieſtie know the truth, perceiuing the deſire he hath to do you ſeruice, I was bold to giue him thankes: further recompence, I leaue to your exellence, who at your pleaſure may better reward him.
            Thou haſt well ſaid daughter, quoth the King, putting me in minde what I ſhould do, leaſt forgetting my honour to ſuch as well deſerue, I be reckoned amongſt the number of thoſe Princes who with faire words and kind lookes féed their ſubiects, ſo long as they haue either Patrimony or other to do them ſeruice, to the vtter ouerthrow of their poſterities

for euer, and they ſo farre in debt they dare not ſhew their heads, then ſhall they get (perhaps) ſome ſuite worth a hundred pounds a yeare, that haue conſumed many thouſands, maintaining a braue port, for his Princes honors. What ſaid I? a hundred pounds a yeare, nay, not that, without the fauour of ſuch as be chéefeſt in authority, and are néere the prince, whoſe good will if they can procure (it may be) they ſhall obtaine ſome ſmall thing, ſcarce able to maintaine the porte of a good yoman: for I tel thée, ſuch muſt be pleaſed, or els let the princes mind be forward to reward them, and by their bountie reléeue their wantes, their good natures by perſwaſion of ſuch as thinke all too much which goeth from themſelues, & ſuch as they pleaſe to beſtow it vpon, ſhall be abuſed. Thus haue I heard gentle Knight, and gréeue, that honour ſhould ſo vnkindly bée rewarded; or that any ſubiect, ſhould forget his dutie▪ ſo much, as for his owne lucre, cauſe thoſe that ſpende their bloud in their countries defence, their landes and poſſeſſions, with emptie purſes and heauie heartes, like men forlorne to walke the ſtreets: exclaiming on them that ſhould ſée their ſeruice better rewarded to the diſhonor of the ſtate they liue in. This my Pheander, I often recount, leaſt in forgetting it, I fall to infamie by committing the like; but he that gaue me reaſon to know good, and to follow it, wil neuer ſuffer me to fall into ſo great folly, nor let me liue, to forget thoſe maimed braue men, that venture for my good and my countries weale: for while I may breath, the ſouldier ſhall be honored in Thrace, and ſhall reape the reward of his merites, neither ſhall theſe Drones, which in ſuch times of perils, hide their heads, ſuck the hony off my garland. Like mindes I wiſh all princes, with carefull eies to looke into the doinges of ſuch, who as the moth deuoureth the fine cloth, conſumeth their princely reputation, & drawthe commons, who by dutie are bound to loue, from their alleageance. While the king was in this ſpeach, worde was brought him, that a Heralde from the campe attended

his pleaſure at the gate, requiring parlie, which he ſuddenlie granted, commanding him to be broght to his preſence: this vnhallowed pagan, who neuer feared God, nor was endued with any humanity, come vnto the kings preſence, with a ſhameles countenance, vſed this peremptory ſpéech.
            King of 
                  Thrace, Muſtaffa Cela, great commander of the empire, & general of thoſe royal armies, ſendeth thée by me, thy choyce either of wars or peace (peace) if thou deliuer thy daughter vnto him whom he hath ſo oftē required, yet wheras his loue vnto her hath bene ſuch, to make her his wife, his noble mind diſpiſeth her ſo much, as his highnes wil neuer ſo much honor her, but in deſpite of thée, and to abate the pride of that diſdainful dame, he wil vſe her as his concubine; & when he ſhal haue taken the flower of her virginity, giue her to the baſeſt villain in his camp. Thou knoweſt my embaſſage: deliuer her, & liue; or by me return thy reſolute anſwere, for it ſhal not be many dayes ere thy citie ſhal flame with fire about thyne eares.
            The king vexed at this vnexſpected meſſage, could not anſwer him, ſo mooued was his choller, yet with as much patience as nature would permit, he ſaide: Pagan, I haue heard, & with great paine endured thy Lordes peremptorie meſſage: and that thou, & that Cur, from whome thou commeſt, ſhal know the great difference betwéen a Chriſtian & him, & that he vnderſtand how honorable we hold the lawe of arms, I pardon thée thy life, which thy preſumption doth require ſharply to be puniſhed. For anſwere to thy Lord, this briefly ſay, his threates I regarde not: for my daughter, as God hath giuen her me, and for ſhe is the onely ioy of my aged life, I wil ſhield her, & in deſpite of the Pagan and his greateſt power, defend her chaſtity: therfore depart and ſay to thy Lord from me, his threates Iwey no more than the words of a child: it is not his multitudes can dant me, were they ten times more then they are, my daughter I wil hold in deſpite of his beard, proud vſurper that hée is. Thou knoweſt my wil, make no ſtay.
            
               The Herald noting the ſtern countenāce of y• king, and hearing his reſolution, thought it not good to ſtay a replie, leaſt his tongue ſwelling in his mouth, might not be eaſed without loſſe of his head; but glad to eſcape his furie, conueyed him from his preſence with al ſpeed he could, poſting to the pauilion of the prince, vnto whome he deliuered the kinges reſolute anſwere, which hee no ſooner heard, but like one beſides himſelfe, he vowed in three dayes to be reuenged of y• old churle, who ſhould faſt the bitternes of his youthful furie. Litle knoweth this proud enemie, the preparation made to bid him welcome, or that his own deſtruction was ſo néere as after it prooued. The Maiden Knight, which with no ſmal grief had endured this proud demaund of the herald, whoſe whole requeſt was for diſhonor of her, he ſo much honored, awaked from melancholy, as out of a ſound ſléep, proſtrating himſelf before the king, he ſaith: renowned Soueraigne, with what grief I haue endured the preſumption of this vſurper, my heart denieth my tongue to vtter, neither ſhal I haue ioy of any thing, til I reuenge the wrongs offered your M. & your princely daughter, vpō that dog. Wherefore dread Lord, grant me licence to iſſue out of the city with my companies, in the ſilent of y• night, & I hope ere long to returne his proud challenge, with my ſword in his throte. Thanks good knight, quoth the King, I accept thy offer as much as if thou hadſt giuē me the whole world in poſſeſſion, yet would I not ſo forward a man ſhuld aduenture himſelf without my company, whoſe cauſe it is, my ſelfe will accompany thée in the fight, and by my herald bid him battell, in which I doubt not of ſucceſſe.
            The Knight was not a litle mooued, to hear his ſuit take no better ſucceſſe, yet not willing to endure any competitor in the honour he hoped of, humblie beſought his Maieſtie of the honour he bare to Armes, in this attempt to giue him leaue, & the rather for the reputation of the Princeſſe, which had geuen him his firſt honor.
            The king which ſaw by his countenance how malecontent,

he reſted at this deniall, howe loth ſo euer he were to graunt the ſame, yet yéelded to his deſire: and taking him from his knée, louingly embracing him, he ſaith. Braue man at armes, take not in ill part, that I haue denyed, neither thinke that it was in any ſort to diſparage you, or the hope I haue of your forwardnes, but for maintaining my owne honour; yet ſéeing your will is to aduenture for mée, goe in Gods name, and he be your defence, that euer comforteth his diſtreſſed: and ſo pulling his ſignet from his finger, he gaue it him, willing that it bee deliuered to the Gouernour of the citie, & let him vnderſtand, his Highneſſe pleaſure was, that he with his armie paſſe at his pleaſure: and ſo taking his humble leaue of the king and gracious miſtreſſe, which affecteth him more then he could conceiue, he departeth, more ioyful of this honor, then to be richlie endowed.
            No ſooner parted he the kings preſence, but ſlacking as litle time as was poſſible, he ſummoned his captaines, and officers, ſtraitly charging thē with al the diligence he could vſe, to gather their companies, & to attend him in the market place: in which charge, no negligence was vſed, ſo that by ſhutting in of the euening, ech captaine with his charge both horſe and foot, attending the comming of their general; who was not vnmindful of his buſines, & after thanks giuē to their leaders, he marched with them to the gate that led them to the camp of the Souldane, & was vpon ſight of the kings ſignet let out. Thus marched the noble Prince, vntil he came halfe way betwéene the campe & the city, where hée called his principall men together, and ſaid.
            Friends, and coparteners in armes, you are now to conſider what we haue taken in hand, for that on our weal dependeth y• whole eſtate of this common weal; if we preuail, what good it is to be freed from ſuch an enemy, there is not the ſimpleſt but can conceiue, hauing taſted the extremity which is incident to warres, and the pleaſure of peace. Contrarie, the ſlauerye and ſeruile liues which theſe are

compeld to endure that fall into their hands, you may imagine by their opprobious vſage of your gracious Prince, and example of other Chriſtians which haue fallen into their handes. Wherefore now is the time to ſhewe your ſelues in this battle, if you ſhewe your force, no doubt of happie ſucceſſe, to your eternall commendations, and to the benefit of your Country, and fréedome of your wiues, children, and families: with theſe and other ſuch ſpéeches hée ſo incouraged the hearts of his followers, as they vowed to follow him with the hazard of their deareſt blood.
            When the Knight ſawe the willingneſſe of his men, and that there reſolution by outward motions, were as hée expected, after he had giuen them many thankes, he made choyſe of fiue hundreth to beare him company. And after he had giuen directions for the Armie to follow, he with his elected company marched on as cloſely as they might, for deſcrying of the enemie, who kept a Court of guard not far from thence, vpon whom in the dead of the night they entered, and finding them at aduantage, which litle doubted any aſſault, hauing neuer before bin aſſailed, were ſome ſléeping, ſome gaiming, & others as ill imployed, ſurprized, and not one left to beare tydings of their ill fortune. This firſt attempt well performed, he paſſed on with all ſpéed towards the Campe, where the Prince laie, ſuddeinly entered the ſame, where like a reſolute and noble Gentleman, he ſo behaued himſelfe, that it filled the harts of his followers with great courage, who behaued themſelues in ſuch maner, that fewe eſcaped with life, but ſuch as were gréeuouſly maimed, ſo that they rather deſired death, then longer to liue. The Prince, who was by one of his Baſhawes counſelled to flie, as the leaſt euill, for auoyding of death, was brauely mounted on a ſwift running G
                  •
               nnef, of which the Mayden Knight being enformed, leauing the fight, hée poaſteth after with ſo good ſpéed, as the harmles Hare, from the cruell iawes of the Grey-hounds, ſuch haſte made this worthie CConquerour, that in euill time for the Prince, he

ouertooke him, accompanied with twelue of his principall Baſhawes, whom he with courage ſo aſſailed, that in a moment he had vanquiſhed them all, leauing ſome breathleſſe, ſome without armes, others without legges, no one eſcaped his furie. In which conflict the Prince eſcaped, but all in vaine, the Deſtenies had determined there to finiſh the honour of that iourney by the hands of the Mayden Knight.
            Who ouertaking him, gaue him ſo gréeuous a blow with his Curtler betwéene the necke and ſhoulders, as made him forget his way, ſaying, ſtaie proude vſurper, and take my Ladie the Princeſſe with thée: And pulling him vehemently by all the force he could by the helmet, vnhorſed him, that the Knight verily ſuppoſed, he had bene ſlaine: wherefore diſmounting himſelfe, hée reuiued him againe, vnto whome he ſayd, My Lorde, this is not for your honour to braue a King in his owne Dominions and in his Court, by your Heralde, and then to haue ſo ſmall care of your worde. In faith Pagane, for thy ſake ile neuer credite anie Heathen on his worde hereafter. Pittie is it a Prince of your extéeme, ſhoulde after ſo manie Lectures reade, plaie the Trewant, (truſt mée) were I your father, I ſhould twigge the youth well, to learne him hereafter to be more carefull of his buſineſſe. The Prince hearing himſelfe ſo frumped, was more gréeued there at then all the loſſe hée had receiued▪ Wherefore with a heart full of carefull heauineſſe▪ he ſaith:
            Braue man at Armes, what ere thou be to whom fortune hath made me thrall, ill beſéemeth ſuch wordes of diſgrace to any one whome the Fates haue ouerthrowne, but curſed my ſelfe which gaue thée this opportunitie, curſed that negligence, which maketh my foe thus to tryumph in my fall. Thou Mahomet, ſuffer me not as thou art a Prophet, to liue thus diſgraced, to beholde the face of anie man ſurprized by ſo cowardly a curre, who daring

not to thruſt his head out of the cennell but by ſtealth, hath wrought my vtter ruine and ouerthrow, taking his aduantage. But glorie not in this victorie, for it may be, thou ſhalt haue ſo great cauſe to repent thée thereof, as pleaſure to behold me now thy priſoner.
            Your Lordſhip is diſpoſed to be pleaſaunt quoth the Knight, but it is the vſe of Chriſtians, to giue loſers leaue to ſpeake, if it ſo happen, my fortune ſhall be the worſe: In the meane time, your Grace ſhall be my gueſt, I haue an hoſtes prouided, wil bid you welcome, who by this time I doubt not doth heare of your comming, that you néede not feare of your dinner.
            The Prince full of heauineſſe, could not tell what to anſwere, wherefore Arming himſelfe with all the patience he could to endure it, he was by this Conquerer, commanded to horſe.
            Long had they not ridden towards his Armie, but he was encountered by diuers his Captaines, who miſſing their Generall, at haphazard put themſelues in ſearch for him, and happily well they met him, who reioycing for his good fortune, taking the Prince priſoner, they recount vnto him, the ruine and ſpoyle of the whole Armie; for which their diligent courage and valour ſhewed, he yéeldeth them moſte great and heartie thankes, beſéeching them to take charge of his Armie, and diuide the ſpoyle amongſt them: which done, repaire at their pleaſures to the Cittie, while he with his priſoner, made haſte to the Kings preſence.
            The tydings of the Knightes ſucceſſe, was by ſome ſuch as honoured him, with ſpéede reported at the Court, in which no parte of his honours was left vnrecounted, whoſe pollicie and valiantneſſe in Armes, the King with al y• Courtiers admired: Imagining him by theſe worthie déedes of Chiualrie, to be the onely man at Armes, deſeruing honour, in all that Region: of whom there was no ſmall ioye, and ſuch fame and renowne of his actions,

as both in Citie and Court there was no talke but tended to the honour of the Mayden Knight, which liked not the Princeſſe Nutania a little, to heare her ſeruant in theſe his firſt attempts, venturing for her to haue ſuch fortunate ſucceſſe, ſo that where ſhe had but begun to like him before, (Cupid) that commandeth the mightieſt, began moſt furiouſly to aſſaile her, that her tender heart vanquiſhed therewith, was enforced to yéeld her ſelfe a ſlaue to his deitie: and giuing ouer other courtlike delightes, bend her whole ſtudie in ſéeking which way to win her beſt beloued to her liking, for the accompliſhing of which, many waies were deuiſed, but none thought ſufficient; ſo that reſting in a laborinth of confuſed thoughts, commanding her attendants from her, ſhe ſaid:
            
               Nutania, what wretch that liueth, enioyeth not more ſwéet content then thy ſelfe, who yéelding to follow the follies of thy youthful mind, haſt planted thy loue thou knoweſt not on whome, a ſtraunger, and of no more reputation then a Merchant, a baſe Trade, and moſt frawdulent, as I haue heard many Nobles diſcuſſe, whereby they obtaine to great wealth: and by their extraordinary meanes, wring ſuch yoong Gentlemen as are forced to haue to doo with them, from their auncient Patrimonies, making of Noble men & Gentiles of great worſhip, beggers, and their owne baſe-born brats, to become yoong maiſters, which in time, and ſmall time, conſumeth that in ryot, which their miſerable fathers, by extortion, falſe reckonings, vnſatiable vſery, and other looſe dealings, ſold their ſoules, the precious Image of our Sauiour, to the diuel. But wretched wretch▪ whither wandreſt thou: theſe be no points for thée to ſtand vpon, thou haſt now vied the game, and art bound by ſuch a band as there is no remedie but ſée it thou muſt: therefore leaue to diſcourſe what he was, or hath bene. Thou heareſt by generall report of all men, he is honorable, in wars valiant, bountifull, and endued with all maner of Gentilmanlike conditions, which argueth him deſcended of better

parentage, then he will acknowledge: And therefore ceaſe not to loue him, who by all coniectures, if outward ſhewes procéede of the motion of the heart, regardeth thy honour; then requite his ſeruice Nutania, and ſéek in time to quench that flame, which beginneth but yet to warme, leſt encreaſing by litle and litle, it conſume thée. In extremes the Noble mind is beſt knowne, happie are they accounted, which forewarned can eſchue a miſchiefe; If thou canſt win thy Loue, what creature may be compared with thée for happie content? Be reſolute Nutania, feare no colours, thy loue is planted on ſuch a one, who for his vertues may be mated with the greateſt Princeſſe on the earth: then ſtand not on termes of his being, but determine to loue him, faint hearted ſouldier neuer gained conqueſt, if he be baſe, thou maiſt aduance him. Thou art heire to the Crown of Thrace, and thy fathers ſole delight, who then ſhould gainſay thy will herein, (fathers ſole delight ſaid I) yea there Nutania lieth a block which thou canſt hardly remoue. Thy father, what will he aged King ſay? when he ſhall heare of thy loue ſo baſely planted, which haſt refuſed to be wife to two famous Kings, requiring thée with great ſute in marriage: Refraine fondling from this raſh determination, let thy fathers loue be a raine to hold thy vnbrideled will, feare his diſpleaſure which gaue thée life, and ſéeke not by thy folly to bring his head with ſorrow to his graue, which if thou perſiſt, will be ſuch a coraſiue to his heart, and ſuch a ſtaine to thine honour, as the memorie of Nutanias diſobedience will neuer be raced out. With theſe and ſuch like motions of good, ſhe ſought to withdraw her loue from him, that for birth and other noble actions deſerued her better, albeit vnknowne to her: but what euer hée be, the more ſhée ſought to ſuppreſſe the flame of her loue, the more it encreaſed, that without regard of fathers good, or her own honour, ſhe determined to loue him, yea the Mayden Knight with his Prize, was arriued at the Court, whom the King and Nobles welcomed with all curteſie they could ſhewe,

as ioyfull of his ſafe returne, who had ſo honourably borne himſelfe in that action, as if he had conquered Europe, which kindneſſe to the knight, was recompence ſufficient for all his charge and hard aduenture.
            The Princeſſe, who was awaked from her ſtudies by report of the knightes comming, ſumptuouſly attired as ſhe could, as beſéemed her eſtate, accompanied with all her troupe of Ladies and maides of honour, came vnto the Preſence, who no ſooner approached the place where the knight was, but beholding the exquiſite perfection of her bewtie which he ſo much delighted in, was ſodeinly bereaued of his ſences, ſo that he ſtood as a mā which had loſt himſelfe, yet reuyuing, loath to make manifeſt what with great griefe hée had conſealed ſo long: humbly on his knées, preſented the glorie of his enterpriſe vnto her, ſaying, Moſt gracious Princeſſe, as by your moſte excellent hands I receiued my firſt ſteppe to honour, and fighting for your Graces and Kingly fathers ſakes, it hath pleaſed God to proſper me with a happy victorie, for which good, hauing nothing worthie to preſent your Grace as I deſire, yet in knowledge of my dutie to your Exellence, to whom my life and ſeruice is deuoted, I humbly beſéech you, accept this Gentleman my priſoner, and your Noble fathers mortall enemie. The Princeſſe to whom nothing could be more pleaſing, thē the ſight of the beloued knight, graciouſly accepted the priſoner, rendering great thankes for the ſame, as alſo for his valour ſhewed in their defence. And then turning to the captiued Prince, ſhe ſaid:
            My Lord, you ſée the chaunce of Fortune, and how mutable ſhe is in all actions, ſometimes fawning, ſometimes frowning, but whether by your fortune, or cowardiſe, or both, you are now at their mercy, whoſe ouerthrow you aſſured your ſelfe of, and which you more deſired then all territories of the earth, but our God which neuer ſuffereth his ſeruants to periſh, hath mightily defended vs, it is not your mightie powers can daunt the hearts of Chriſtians,

whoſe God is their guide: neither regard we them at all as a matter of any truſt, your eyes can witneſſe, who hauing an Army able as you thought to haue vanquiſhed all Chriſtendome, is by a handfull to your multitudes ſurprized. Yet diſmay not my Lord, a Maiden is your Iaylor who wil vſe you more honourably then you can imagin, or your hard threats deſerueth. The Prince which ſaw the bewtie of the Princeſſe, whom he ſo earneſtly vpon reports had deſired, was aſtonied greatly, holding the fame that was bruted, to be nothing to her worthineſſe, therfore accuſing himſelfe of great impietie, that had borne Armes againſt the onely Paragon of the earth, and not by curteſie haue continued his loue begun, aſhamed of himſelfe, he ſaith.
            Renowmed Lady, Fortunes darling, & Bewties chiefe pride, though miſhap hath made me of a Prince and heire to the mightieſt Potentate of the earth, a captiue, and that by thy champion I am diſhonored, and my power vanquiſhed, croſſes which may cauſe the ſtouteſt that euer liued, to cry out on Fortune, & to curſe the Deſtinies, yet am I comforted in y• ſwéetnes of your words, which diſdaineth to vſe the vtmoſt cruelty you might, or take his life that had vowed to vſe you with more extremes, then if by the greateſt torments I could haue afflicted you withall, I had cauſed you die many thouſand deaths, if it were poſſible ſo many could 
                  •
               e incident to one bodie. Had I preuailed of thy curteſie famous Princeſſe, I cannot ſay what I would, but vow vnto thée by the honour of my fathers Crowne, while I breath to remaine a true liegeman vnto thée vertuous Nutania, whoſe curteſie hath ſubdued my chollor, and put my oppreſſed heart from a million of cares wherewith it was oppreſt. My Lord quoth the Princeſſe, your Lordſhip is merily diſpoſed, indéed women are gods children, wonne with a toy, ſuch fooles they are, yet my Lord, I wold you did know, how litle I eſtéem the flattery of men, of what eſtate ſoeuer, they would ſpend their friuolous ſpéech elſewhere: for your Lordſhip, though you pleaſe to ieſt, I thanke God

you haue ſuch cauſe ſo to do, whom I praiſe for the victorie receiued, and next his dutie, my ſeruant for his paines imployed for our ſafetie. And with theſe words, ſhe gaue him ſo gracious a looke, as well might the ſtanders by ſée it was not feined, but that her ſpéech ſpoken in his praiſe, procéeded of the inward motions of the hart, which of the captiue Prince was not vnperceiued, which cauſed him to replie thus.
            Madame, for auoyding of that odious ſinne of flattery, which my heart hath euer contemned, I dare not ſay what I would, yet ſéeing the deſtinies are ſo pleaſed to yéeld me a priſoner to my enemie, I reckon my vnhappineſſe the leſſe, which haue ſo gracious a Ladie for my kéeper, of whom, expecting no better then death, I am by your comfort quite depriued of that feare. And for this noble Gentleman, how Fortune and the Fates hath fauoured him in this victorie, wherein I am ſo diſhonoured, euery man cannot conceiue. But were the honor therof a million more, yet not to be weighed in the ballance where your Grace doth counterpeaſe the ſame, which is more to be eſtéemed then the worlds good: how you hold him in regard I know not, but if an enemies praiſe may any way honour him, I ſay; and with my blood wil auouch, that for his valour, none liueth on the confines of the earth his equall; wherefore madame, boaſt you of his worthineſſe which is péerleſſe, and worthie for all perfections, to be honoured of the mightieſt Monarke that liueth.
            Thankes my Lord, quoth the Princeſſe, for your good opinion of my ſeruant, I doubt not but he will ſay as much for you, when opportunitie ſhall ſerue, who I aſſure you, is as curteous, as otherwiſe honourably endued. While they were thus pleaſantly diſcourſing, word was brought the King, that Theophilus Prince of Theſſaly, who by the outrage of a cruell ſtorme, had ſuffered ſhipwracke, was found on a raft, driuen a ſhore vpon the fartheſt parts of his confines: where being vnknowne to any his ſubiects, but by

his owne report, was by the Gentlemen of his country entreated, as beſéemed his eſtate: and accompanied with a princely traine, was within halfe a dayes iourney of the Court. The ſodaine report whereof, brake their talke, the King commanding his traine preſently to be readie horſſed to accompany him, who with diligence failed not to obey his commaund: and ſo orderly marching through the Citie, they ryde eaſily paced, vntill they méete the ſtraunger King, betwéene whom great curteſie was vſed. The King gaue thankes and louing countenance to the Gentlemen, who had to their great coſt ſo honored him, by enterteining this ſtraunger, whereby his countrey was made famous. Thus with diuerſe diſcourſes they paſſed the time till they came to the Court, where a ſtately lodging was puruayed for him, and Officers appointed to attend his perſon, as royally as if he had bene in his owne Pallace, where ſolacing with the King and his Nobles, we leaue him, to return vnto Pheander the Mayden Knight, whoſe entrailes frying with the ſcorching flames of his miſtreſſe bewtie, had ſo much changed his colour, and impaired his ſtrength, that enforced by great griefe and extremitie of his loue, he withdrew him to his chamber, where caſting himſelfe on his bed with a million of carefull thoughts, eftſoones, determining to ſéeke the Princes fauour. And then by contrarie motions, fearing the ſucceſſe of his ſute, carrying the report of no better then a Merchant, which might giue cauſe of great diſlike, and diſparage his ſute, he ſaith, miſerable Dionicus, whom the Fates continually cauſeth by their hard hap daily to complaine, curſing the time of thy natiuitie, and the ſtarres which gouerned thine aſpects, which neither time or place can remedie, faint hearted wretch, that ſéeking thy owne ouerthrow, encreaſeth thy griefe by conſealing the cauſe. Leftes not thou thy Princely father, to come hither, where thou mighteſt enioy the preſence of thy beloued miſtreſſe, and in doing her ſeruice, to acquaint her with thy loue? and coward like ſhameſt thou to let hir know

thy zeale, whoſe curteſie is without compare, and euerie way ſheweth in what regarde ſhée holdeth thee, that hath procured her libertie in aduenturing thy life? a pleaſure that of a thankfull minde can neuer be forgotten. What knoweſt thou whether her loue be as much to thée, whom womanly modeſtie denieth to reueale, elſe mightſt thou happily knowe it? No, no, fondling, thy fortune is not ſo happie, which euer hath liued in vnhappineſſe, yet diſpaire not, nor like a wretch die in thy Cabenet, Rowſe thée, and conſider what thou art, giue not ouer thy deſires to miſerable death, without acquainting her with thy loue: ſpare to ſpeake, and ſpare to ſpéede, A Prouerbe not ſo old as true, which if thou follow, will either giue thée comfort by her curteous grant, or by deniall, haſten thy death, by which thou ſhalt be freed from theſe torments; enioying life, and liuing, enioy thy ſwéete delight, or by death, end

                theſe torments. In this reſolution, hauing baniſhed diſpaire, arming himſelf with hope of good ſucceſſe, ſtretching his weake limbes, he haſteneth to the Preſence, whoſe abſence had bene noted of moſte Courtiers attendant there, but eſpecially of the Princeſſe, who (albeit) found the companie vnfurniſhed, wanting his companie, yet durſt not enquire of him, doubting the ſuſpition of iealious eyes: But Fortune who had ſo long ſpurned at him with her foote, gaue him this opportunitie to raiſe him, whome▪ ſhe had like to haue ouerthrowne, chauncing to looke out of a windowe which opened into a Parke belonging to the Court, hée eſpied the Princeſſe, pleaſantly paſſing the time with her Traine of Ladies, which opportunitie hée was not willing to loſe, but with all ſuch ſpéede as his fainting legges could make, reuiued by the ſight of his ſwéete chaſe, with all ſayles ſpread, in ſhort time hée recouered his wiſhed deſire, who was no ſooner of the Princeſſe ſéene, his humble dutie done, and ſhe hauing requited the ſame, giuing him the time of the day, with a moſt pleaſant and friendly countenance, ſhe challenged him of

negligence, whom ſhe had not ſéene in two or thrée daies: and leading him politikely, pretending matter of importance, to impart vnto him, from the companie, ſhe brought him neare the ſide of a faire Copes, which ſo ouerſhadowed them, that the Sunne beames could not offend them, where they might both boldly ſay whatſoeuer it pleaſed them, without being heard or ſéene of any, which might interrupt them, which cauſed her take opportunitie to diſcuſſe with him thus. Seruant quoth ſhe, I pray thée ſay, of ye duty thou haſt vowed thy miſtreſſe, and by thoſe ſwéete thoughts which are beſt pleaſing vnto thée, what is the Lady to whō thy loue is dedicated? for loue doubtleſſe thou doeſt, thy countenance bewraieth it, which I haue noted, with more regard then becommeth a maiden: yet of care to thée, whoſe health I tender, for thy curteſie & good ſeruice done, which I wold requite in the beſt maner I might; and for thy lookes ſheweth thy heart craueth to be pitied of thy Ladie, let mée know her, who may chance ſtand thée in ſome ſtéed, for women may preuaile much one with an other. The Knight wrapt into a heauen of ioyes, hearing the goddeſſe of his deuotion, with ſuch fauour and kindnes to vſe him, with a bluſhing countenance ſtanding at the bar, before her, whoſe ſentence pronounced, was either life or death, he ſaith: Honorable and gracious miſtreſſe, giue me leaue ſo to call your highneſſe, ſince you haue dained a captiue the title of your ſeruant, and pardon my preſumption, anſwering your demand; that I loue I cannot deny, which argueth your ſkil in phiſick great (whom) my tongue is reſtrained to reueale: but if your highneſſe could iudge whoſe loue I moſt adore, and long haue, and iudging, eaſe me, I ſhould haue cauſe to ſay, no phiſicke proferer on the earth whatſoeuer, might compare with my gracious miſtreſſe for ſkill; I dare ſay no more, fearing to offend. The Princeſſe all this time gazed on the perfection of her ſeruant, as déeply enamoured on his perfection, as the Knight inueagled with hers, for her eye made a ſuruey of his excellent feature, which ſhée founde

more perfit, by how much the more ſhe had bent her liking to loue him. Thus loue which had aſſailed both their harts, endued them with ſuch a ſi

In this heauen of happie content they had not long bene, Guenelia a Ladie, that attended the Princes, brought her word, the King her father, with the King of Theſſaly, was comming into the Parke, which place they had choſen to recreate themſelues: Where paſſing on by faire Paris, they diligently liſten to the ſwéete recordes of the pritie birds, who ſkipping from trée to trée, gaue as well the content beholding it, as the eare pleaſure in their notes, great was the delight they receiued, viewing the bewtie of the place, which for pleaſant walkes, ſwéete groues, and fruitfull trées of all ſortes, was matchleſſe, into which manie pleaſant brookes had recourſe: on the bankes of which, finding the place bewtified with Natures gifts, they ſat them downe earneſtly beholding the pleaſure of the fiſhes, how pretely they chaſed one the other, with many a pleſant conceiued toy, which they noted, cenſuring of each ſeuerall action, as they thought beſt to encreaſe their mirth. When ſome time was ſpent on this pleaſant manner, Philarcus King of Thrace, finding himſelfe all alone with the King of Theſſaly, hauing neuer queſtioned of him his vnhappie fortune, began with him thus.

                thoughts, that his colour ſhowed better his diſcontent to recount it, then his

tongue ableneſſe to anſwere the kings demand, how willing ſo euer he was to ſatiſfie him, yet after ſome pauſe taken, he ſaith:
            Right curteous, and mirrour of the world for Nobility, though nothing can be more diſpleaſing to my grieued heart, then recounting my aduerſe fortune, yet that your Grace ſhall not find any ingratitude in me, at whoſe hands I haue receiued ſuch honourable entertainment, attende me.
            It is not many yeares ſince Mantonna my father deceiſed, who left me (vnhappie I) his ſucceſſour to inherite the crowne, which I did not long enioy, before Donatia King of Egypt, required of me my ſiſter in mariage; who being beautifull, and in the flouriſhing time of her yeares, hauing not yet attained to the full of fiftéene, yong ynough to be beſtowed, yet of that wiſdome, that I referred ye choiſe of her loue to her owne liking, induced▪ thereunto by the many euils happening by ſuch made marriages, wher the children are forced by the couetous deſires of their parents, to ioyne wealth to wealth, others for great patrimonies; all for lucre, fewe or none for loue. But whether the beauty of my ſiſter Phedera (for ſo was ſhe called) or the deſire of her dowrie, which was great, or either of them, or both, I cannot ſay, 
                  •
               ut my ſiſter being made acquainted with his ſute, I craued her anſwere, for which his Ambaſſadors attended in my Court, with the beſt entertainment I could giue, whome my ſiſter Phedera with her owne mouth anſwered (woe is me) vnhappy the tongue that pleaded deniall to his ſuite, but moſt of all, vnhappy the houre when firſt of all hee determined to craue her at my handes, in whoſe power it was not to graunt: no ſooner arriued his Nobles at the Court, and he ſcarſlie had receiued the ſum of her anſwere, but as one bereft of all honour, reaſon, and gouernment, he vowed reuenge on me and my countrey. And leuying a mighty power both of horſe and foot, aſſailed me in mine owne territories, whome by the mighty power

of the Almightie, I expelled my lande, to their great diſhonour, and no ſmall loſſe to my ſubiectes: yet how great ſoeuer his ouerthrowe was, (an honourable minde I muſt ſay) were the cauſe iuſt, he ordeined a mightie power by ſeas, whereof being by my eſpyalles aduertiſed of the time as neare as they could geſſe they would be readie, with a power well ſhipped and furniſhed, I met him neare his owne Confines, where a mortall fight was begunne, and moſte valiantly continued, neyther ſide giuing any ſhewe of fainting. But alaſſe, too ſoone commeth that grief which meiteth my hart into thouſands of teares, to recount the Admirall of mine owne Squadron, being ſuncke, and two others forced by the cunning hand of their Gunners, to lye by the Lée, the reſt fainted: which béeing perceiued of the enemie, they boorded, and by hundreths entered my ſhippes and gallies, who were valiantly repulſed. But men can doo no more then God will giue them leaue, ſo long they continued the fight, that the ſcupars guſhed bloud, as they had often with the water deliuered by the Pompe. And here laye one maimed, and there a number ſlaine. This pittifull ſtratageme, when my heart with heauineſſe behelde, being ſo hardly aſſailed, my ſelfe, after that I was cleared from the Fléete, the winde fauouring mée with a happie gale, and my ſhip being good of ſaile, I forſooke the fight, in hope to haue recouered in my owne Countrey, and by a new ſupply, haue giuen him welcome thither. But my hopes herein deceiued, a boyſterous ſtorm growing, the ſea who is mercileſſe, aroſe in extremitie, ſwelling with ſuch outrage, that my weak barke no longer able to endure her cruelti

To remedy the which, the Mariners did their beſt, but in vaine ſtriue they that labour againſt his will that commaundeth all. (What ſhould I ſay) the outrage of the

ſtorm was ſuch, as forced the ſhip vpon the Lée ſhore, which gaue vs all cauſe to remember our maker, and with heartie prayer to craue his aſſiſtance: but our comfort, was comfortleſſe, our ſhyp ſplit, and we all driuen to make what ſhift we might, my ſelf happening on the main yard, after that I had bene gréeuouſly beaten at ſea, the whole night was driuen a ſhore on your Confines, I neuer heard of any other that were ſaued. With this the teares reſtrained his ſpéech, that he could not ſpeake, which moued the King to more pittie of his eſtate, and friendly imbracing him, he ſayd; No more my Lord at this time, I am ſorie that I haue giuen you ſuch cauſe of griefe, thus by recounting ſo lamentable a ſtate, renew your paſſed griefes. But comfort good King, when tides be at the loweſt, they ſpring againe. If the Egyptian King be ſo extreame, reaſon with curteſie will not content him, the cauſe being no other, but to force the loue of a woman vnto him, of which, perhaps he were better be without: On the word of a King, and by my honor I ſweare, I will not leaue you, vntill I ſée you ſetled in your kingdome. Thus the King whome ſorrow had ouerburthened, was by the comfort of this noble King his hoaſt, recomforted, whoſe whole ſtudie was now in preparing of an Army to ayde him, to which care we leaue them.
            
               Nutania, whoſe reſtleſſe paſſions neither time nor place could alter, burning in theſe remedileſſe thoughts, conſidering the penance her louing heart was like to endure, ſhe fell into this humor.
            
               Nutania, how haue the Fates ordeined to make thée vnhappie? that thou being deliuered from an oppreſſing enemy, then ſteppes in loue to beginne a new Tragedie. Thou ſeeſt her fawnings is but flattery, then ſéek to eſchue them, enter not too far in the forde, leaſt minding but to wet thy ſhoe, thou plunge ouer head and eares. Thy yeares albeit not many, with the examples of others, whom then

haſt read, may learne thée to be wiſe: if thy fancie be fixed on ſuch vanitie as may bréed thy ſorrow, expell it as thou maiſt, ſuffer not loue to harbour in thy heart, for harbored, he commonly pleades poſſeſſion; and once poſſeſt, neither force, nor entreatie may remoone him, ſo ambitious a tyrant is he, that voyd of pittie, againſt law and all hoſtility he holdeth what hée liſt. Alaſſe Nutania, if thy enemy be ſuch what auayleth thée; thou maiſt wiſh to be fréed from his tyrannie, but canſt neuer auoyd it, ſo imperious is hée, yet not manly, but as a Coward, making the breach where the wall is weakeſt: poore women is the marke, whereat moſt commonly he aymeth, who being by nature pittifull, are eaſie to beléeue, and by

               oo light credite, are taken by them they beſt like of. Thus (poore wench) doeſt thou nothing but heaue feathers againſt the winde, which returne into thine owne eies: thy ſpeaches vttered in loues diſhonour, will be challenged, and like a traiterous Rebel to his Deitie ſhalt thou be conuicted, arraigned and condemned, for deprauing his Godhead. If it be death (fondling) to ſpeake againſt the maieſtie of a Prince, what is it to contemne the powers aboue? The beſt remedie thou haſt is reconciliation, wherewith the Gods are pleaſed; and hartily ſorrowing for thy miſſe, yéeld thy ſelfe vanquiſhed, & yéelding, ſéeke by fauour, to attaine the end of thy deſires. Thy loue is matchleſſe, and doubtleſſe honourable, his countenance ſheweth the true badge of Nobilitie, and his valour and bountie doe anſwere what his other perfections promiſe: I haue often heard it ſpoken, that womens helpes in extremitie haue bene great; if that be true proofe Nutania, cal thy wittes together, and ſo end thy tormentes, by enioying thy heartes content, ſo much diſcontent by yéelding to the ſame.
            Thus reſolued, without longer ſtay ſhée called vnto her Guenela, her chiefe attendant, who from her infancy had bene brought vp with her: In this Guenela, ſhe conceiued her greateſt hope, vnto whome ſhe ſaide: Guenela, ſince I

had reaſon to diſcerne good from euill, thou knoweſt how I haue tendered thée, and how willing I would be to ſéeke thy preferment: make triall when thou pleaſe, ſo ſhalt thou be aſſured of that, which iuſtly thou maiſt hold in ſuſpence. But leauing theſe coniuring words, I muſt Guenela, commit vnto thy ſecrets, a matter of import, wheron my honor and reputation dependeth: for I tell thée Guenela, I haue made choyce of thée amongeſt, all thoſe which I may command, as of her I loue, and haue beſt cauſe ſo to do, hauing had ſuch ſocietie, elſe ſhould I rather chuſe to dye ten thouſand deaths, then reueale it.
            
               Guenela, which had her whole hope of good from the Princeſſe, hearing her ſpéeches, with teares ſtanding in hir eyes, procéeding of ioy, for the honor done her by her Lady, proteſted vnto her by heauens maker, and what elſe he framed, to be ſecret in her determinations, and do her beſt endeuour to accompliſh whatſoeuer ſhe commaunded. The Princeſſe taking her word for currant, in whom ſhe neuer found deceit, ſaid; Guenela, that it is incident to all creatures in their kinde to loue, I know thy wittes be not ſo ſimple, but thou canſt conceiue, and he that frameth vs, directeth our likings as beſt pleaſeth him, be it prince or begger, from the higheſt to the ſimpleſt, and he my Guenela, hath linked my liking to a moſt braue toward Gentleman (on whom I thinke) if affection which is blind, deceiue me not, is worthie to be mated with the greateſt in degrée on the earth. To kéepe thée with friuolous ſpéech, is no time now, hauing other matter inough to diſcourſe: therefore that thou maieſt knowe him to whome my loue is vnited, Pheander the new adopted Knight is hée, (Pheander) famous for his valour, renowmed for his bountie, and admired for curteſie, he, he, Guenela, is the ioy of my heart, (and my hearts ſole delight) without whom I cannot liue, no, I wil not liue, I, neither may I liue, ſuch is the ſeruice my heart hath vowed in loue vnto him: therefore if thou loue me as thou haſt profeſt, by thy induſtrie ſéeke to 
                  •
               aue my

life, which cannot but periſh not obteining my deſires.
            
               Guenela, liſtning to her diſcourſe, willing to become ſecond in this Comedie, had her braines beating alreadie in ſearch of the charge committed vnto her, yet would ſhée not anſwere any thing ſodeinly, conſidering how diſpleaſing ſpéeches ſpoken out of time, be vnto louers coraſiues: yet chearing the Princeſſe, ſhée requeſted vntill the next morning, reſpite for anſwer, which the Princeſſe granted, affying greatly in her which was wiſe and wel demeaned, many wayes (ſometime doubtfull) ſometime pleaſing, ſifted her ſences to the proofe, whom to her ſtudy we leaue.
            The Mayden Knight, whoſe extremes were far more (if more might be) after his abrupt parting with his miſtreſſe, that he grew ſo melancholy, as nothing were it vyandes to relieue his weake corpſe, neither the daintineſſe of pleaſing ſweete Muſicke wherewith his friends preſented him, might any way delight him, ſo that in outragious maner, he exclaimed on his miſfortune, curſing the tidings bringer of the Kings repaire to the Parke, and his tongue for not reuealing his griefe, his Phiſition ſo readie to hear, that diſpairing of his hope to enioy her, he was likely to miſchiefe himſelfe: yet reaſon affirming, that the learnedeſt Phiſition could not diſcouer the diſeaſe of his Patient, without he ſhew it, how neare ſoeuer he geſſe. Entering further in conſideration of her fauourable ſpéeches, ſhaking off feare, like a hardie ſouldier, he determined in writing to let her know his loue, ſince he had no hope to méete her againe at the like aduantage. Therefore like the condemned, hoping of pardon, liueth the Knight, yet deſirous to be reſolued, either of comfort or diſpaire, he calleth for Penne and Inke, and write thus. To

That many meſſengers haue incurred diſpleaſure, yea and loſſe of life as the cauſe hath deſerued, I hope it is not vnknowne vnto you, yet hath the harmeleſſe meſſenger knowne as litle what he carried, as I deſirous to know of you.
            Swéete Guenela, quoth the Knight, that it is wiſedom to beware by others harmes, I deny not, yet is it diſcurteſie to deny the requeſt of a Gentleman, which haue euer ſhewed my ſelfe a dutifull ſeruant to his highneſſe, and honoring him, can I frame my heart to preiudiſe that Ladie of incomparable vertue? No, no, heauens neuer permit me life, to offend her in the leaſt ſort. Therefore doubt no ſuch matter, for on the word of a Gentleman, my life ſhall be offered and fréely giuen, to excuſe thy friendſhip, wherein I am ſo greatly pleaſured by you. Guenela, noting by the often changing colour in telling his tale, his heart was not his owne, but had ſome more buſineſſe in hand then hée would impart, loath to offend his patience by her deniall, ſayd; Sir, perſwading my ſelfe of your loyaltie, I will for this time become your Embaſſador, although it ſhould impaire my credite with her Exellence, whoſe fauour I hold as deare as my life, and that you ſhall aſſure your ſelfe of my truſtineſſe herein, ſo pleaſe it you to méete me in this place to morrow, by that time the Suns power ſhall haue drawne the deawe from off the earth, I ſhall returne you anſwere as you deſire.
            Thankes good Guenela, for thy curteſie, aſſure you I will not dye in thy debt, if euer Pheander may requite it

by any induſtry. In the meane time quoth he, fauour me ſo highly as weare this for my ſake, and pulling off a Dyamond of great priſe gaue it her, which ſhe was loth to accept, yet giuing thanks for his curteſie, ſhe ſayd:
            Sir, would you did vnderſtand, I priſe not my paines, that you ſhuld reward me with hyre, or do you good in hope of benefit▪ or as it is vnfitting a gentle woman to take gifts beſtowed in ſuch maner, ſo is it diſcurteſie and no part of a woman like condition, to refuſe the gift of a friend: therfore accept my thankes, till I may better deſerue it. Thus time paſſing away, Guenela taking her leaue, departed towards the Princeſſe, and the Knight to his lodging, where, how many ſundry thoughts aſſailed him, I leaue to them, that haue endured the like.

(if not) vſe me no more thus vnkindly, leaſt ouercome with the extreme of my griefe, I chance to ſay with my tongue▪ what my heart will repent, or vſe my hands with ſuch rygor, as becommeth not a mayden.
            The Gentlewoman ſéeing the wind blow ſo warme, fearing as much as was promiſed, ſéeing the Princeſſe impatience ſuch, thoght not good to tempt her aboue her ſtrength, for women being by nature warme, with a litle f
                  •
               wel will be made hotte, paſt reaſon: wherefore, making a preamble to her diſcourſe, like an eloquent Orator began thus.
            
               (Pheander) with that word, making a long pauſe, to note the Princeſſe countenance, on the ſodain naming her beloued, was interrupted thus; Pheander? Guenela? what franticke humor cauſeth thée to name him in this manner, with whome thou hadſt neuer anything to ſay? Madame quoth Guenela, attend the reſt, before you either condemne me, or commend me. Then procéed quoth the Princeſſe.
            This Pheander, of whom my tale is before your Exellence to be told, is that Knight who of your maieſtie is called the Mayden Knight, this Knight as it is told me, loueth a Lady, but whō I cannot declare, before I know: but as it is told me by his dear friend which knoweth the ſecrets of his

heart, ſo tormented is he in his paſſions, that the night naturally made for reſt, (reſtleſſe) he conſumeth in great diſcontent, (the day) wherein all creatures delight, is vnto him loathſome, ſo that through watching, and refuſing his dyet, with other cares which cloyeth his ſtomake, his louely face is altered from the ſanguine, vnto the yealow coloured Saffrone, (yea Madame) theſe mine eyes are witneſſes of it, who this day ſawe him paſſe into the Court, ſo féeble, that his weake legges might hardly endure the waight of his bodie. No more of this my ſwéete Guenela, leaſt thy tongue buſied too long on this Tragedie, ouercome with the extremitie of my griefe, I 
                  •
               e enforced to ſeeke an ende of my torments by diſpatching my owne life. Oh Guenela, is this thy comfortable confection? Is this the reliefe thou preacheſt off, which would yéeld me ſuch quiet of minde? Vnhappie Lady, why ſhould I liue to ſée another enioy my Loue? Is not Pheander my ſeruaunt? haue not I made choyſe of him? and ſhall another no way worthie to enioy him, haue that intereſt which might delight the Goddeſſes? Peace Nutania, whither romeſt thou? let reaſon ſubdue rage, let not euery one knowe thy loue to Pheander, but conceale it as thou maiſt, and ſéeke ſome ſecret deuiſe to giue thy hart eaſe, by death which is thy beſt remedy: yet would I liue to become a ſuccour for the well deſeruing Knight, and gaine his hearts deſire for him if I might. Cruel were that 
                  •
               ame & not worthy to inioy the ſimpleſt groom, which cauſ
                  •
               es for loue, conſumeth ſuch a man in all perfections and liniaments of body, as Pheander, without yéelding him loue. But hearken Guenela, that thou maiſt in time when my bodie ſhall be intombed among the dead, report vnto my Loue, (and louing Knight) how deare I held his loue, as my countenance often ſhewed, (though he) careleſſe of loues toyes neuer regarded it, & for he ſhall well know at my laſt ende how I wiſh his welfare, doo but this for me, by his friend to learn the Ladies name whō the Knight is ſo inthralled. This is all the ſeruice that I will

euer command thée, that knowing hir, I may become an interceſſor for him, whom my hart more deſireth than all the worlds poſſeſſions: with this, teares which trickled downe from her eyes, reſtrayned her tongue. In which ſorrowful paſſion, her maiden became a partner, and grieued for her follie, committing ſo haynous a faulte in procuring the ſame; ſhe excuſed in this maner.
            Moſt gacious Princeſſe, how much I grieue to ſée your diſcomfort, I can not ſay, but hope your Grace will pardon me, which haue bene more bold, (preſuming on your fauour) then beſéemeth mée, neyther what I haue done (gracious Lady) was of any intent to offend you, but to acquite my ſelfe of blame, in a matter which I haue of curteſie vndertaken, as the ſequele ſhall manifeſt, if it ſhall pleaſe your Ladiſhip to peruſe this letter, which will (no doubt) reſolue you, without further paines to me, or trouble to your Grace, what ſhe is that is beſt beloued of the Maiden Knight on the earth. This letter I receiued at his handes, who hearing of your diſquiet, deſirous (as it ſhould ſéeme) to acknowledge his dutie to you, coniured mée by many faire words, and proffrrs of good, to deliuer it vnto your hands; which albeit for modeſty I did long refuſe, thruſting that from me with my finger, which I woulde willingly haue drawne to me with all my force: in the end I conſented, & the rather for your Ladiſhips quiet, which as I ſuppoſe, will bid it welcome for the maiſters ſake; who if my iudgment in the Planet Venus deceiue me not, wil prooue ſhortly a coniunction, or Ile neuer truſt my ſkill again; for Venus being in the ſigne Leo, hath domination ouer both houſes, viz. he and ſhe, or hée and you.
            The Princeſſe at her laſt ſhift, when ſhe heard Guenelas tale, voyd of all hope to enioy her beloued Pheander, after ſhée had a while pauſed, as one at length awaked from her memento, as from a ſléepe, ſhe ſaith; Now truſt me wench, thou haſt cunningly gone about the buſh, and haſt daintily ſought to enter into my déepeſt ſecretes, yet how cunningly

ſo euer you haue dealt, there may be a quilitie to deceiue both thée and him: but I pray thée Guenela, tell mée what ſpéeches vſed the Maiden Knight at the deliuery therof, tell me ſwéet gyrle in friendſhip.
            The deſpairing Knight (good Madam) for ſo I muſt call him, howe euer his vallour ſhowes it ſelfe in fielde, as no doubt woorthily; ſo ſaith report: yet in loue I ſée his daſtardneſſe, who loueth, yet dare not reueale the ſum of his deſires, but muſt commit it to a tell-tale paper; languiſhing to the death, wanting his delight, and prolonging his ſorrowes by ſilence, his lookes bewraying more than he can vtter: for be it ſaid, he that had ſéen not long ſince his beautie and gallant grace, the abilitie of his bodie, and noted euery particular lineament, at this time with the debility thereof, ſhould ſée a metamorphoſis, which might mooue the moſt hardeſt hart to pittie; the cauſe to me vnknowne, but ſuſpected. The aſſurance I doubt not but your Grace wil ſoon vndeſtand, if you vouchſafe to teare the ſeale and peruſe the contents.
            The Princeſſe which thought euery minute a yeare till ſhe had knowledge of the Knights minde, put her maiden from her prattle with a fained meſſage, when being all alone, with a number of ſorrowfull ſighes for the Knights perplexitie, ſhe read, and manie times reade thoſe lines, which gaue her firſt comfort of enioying her heartes coutent: how welcome they were vnto her, it may better bée imagined than explaned; whoſe head was wholly buſied in anſwering the ſame, for which the thought it not vnfit to vſe the help of Guenela; wherfore reſting from her former ſtudies, we leaue her contemplating on her loue, til Guenela her returne; who ſéeing her Ladies callour ſomwhat reuiued, began to ſmile. Madame (quoth ſhee) though I made a fault in detayning ſo long the phyſicke that I promiſed you, yet I hope your Maieſtie will pardon that offence, conſidering the good it doth in working; howe you diſgeſt it I know not, but hée that hath leaſt ſkill in iudging

complexions, will ſay your mariage is mended by twentie in the hundred; if you recouer but ſo much of your loſſe euery two dayes, there are few (in one wéeke) wil beleeue you haue bene ſicke. Well wanton, well (anſwered the Princeſſe) you haue bene pretily diſpoſed to play your parte, and take your paſtime in beholding the follie of both our loues, which I am the more willing to forget, in that thou haſt ſo rightlie iudged of both our griefes. But leauing ieſt, I pray thée ſay my ſwéet Guenela, what ſayd my ſeruant when hée deliuered theſe letters vnto thée? Madame, to ſay trueth; nothing touching his loue; but imported with ſuch earneſtneſſe; for the preſenting them vnto your handes, as might haue made many proude to doe ſo charitable a dée
                  •
               e, crauing it with ſpéech ſo pitifull, and lookes ſo ruthfull: for mine owne part, my heart imagining by your affection, that the Goddes which cauſed your grief, had fettered him, and wel knowing where loue is vnited, the ones weal is the others good; though I were hardly won to the ſame, I vndertooke the hazard of your good wil, promiſing to returne to him an anſwere thereof, wherein I ſhall breake promiſe, without you graunt your conſent.
            Oh Guenela, doubts thou of my conſent for anſwering of his kinde letters, which haue endured ſo many nights of vnreſt, and carefull dayes for his ſake? No, heauens neuer graunt me good in this world, if I ſéeke not his content, & that with ſo good loue and affection, as hée offereth his loue and ſeruice to me, vnkind were I els, that louing am beloued, ſhould ſuffer my deareſt loue to languiſh, who may remedy it. Therefore Guenela, as thou haſt plaide the Aduocate, ſo make I thée my principall and chiefe Secretorie: peruſe theſe lines, and in right conſider if that his griefe deſerue not to be pittied, then let me ſée thy ſkill in enditing, to the which thou ſhalt haue my helpe. Delay the time no longer, hunger (my Wench) is ſharp ſawce (as thoſe ſay which haue good ſtomackes) and I meaſuring

his deſires by mine owne, imagine that meate cannot bee more pleaſing to the hungry, then the vnexſpected tydings of conſent, from his new acknowledged Loue. Soft fire, Madame, quoth Guenela, makes the ſwéeteſt Mault, ſay our huſwiues: your Ladiſhip is farre wide: what? no ſooner at the ſtyle, but ouer haſte makes waſte; looke before you leape, leaſt a blocke vnthought of, chaunce to breake your ſhins. What if theſe letters impart his loue, how are you aſſured thereof? Men are ſubtil, and can caſt many cullours to deceiue women; all is not gold that gliſtereth, nor al ſugar that hath a ſwéete taſte; vnder the gréeneſt graſſe lurketh y• poyſoned Adder; the Crocadile ſheadeth moſt tears, when he ſéeketh moſt to deceiue: try ere you truſt, Madam, repentance comes too late; therefore howſoeuer you affect him, conceale it: Lightly wonne, is as lightly loſt. The Labourer that gayneth his mony by hard labour, is more chary in parting therewith, then the purloyning théefe, or the ryotous youth, which by ſubtill practiſes draweth all he can from his kind parents, to maintaine his inordinate expences. Let him bite on the bridle a while, yet gently line his curbe, that he galle: not a litle thing pleaſeth a childe, and a good countenance is woorth golde, to him that regardeth it, as he profeſſeth. Weigh your own eſtate, which are heir to this moſt famous crowne of Thrace, with the baſeneſſe of his calling, which was no better than a Marchant: conſider what a corraſiue this loue of yours woulde be to your honorable father, ſhould he know it, and how your Nobles would ſtomacke him for his birth, grieuing to liue in obedience to one ſo farre their inferiour. The enuious regard not what vertues he is poſſeſt with, which I muſt néedes ſay, deſerue to bée accounted: the man gayning honour by vertue and valour, is more woorthy to gouerne the State then the Noble, which ignobleth his houſe by his bad demeanor. How many ſuch there bée in this Court I grieue to ſée, who liuing licentiouſly, abuſe themſelues in ſuch odious maner, that if your Ladiſhippe heard the pitifull complaints

of the Commons, crying out on the Prince for iuſtice againſt them, and how by fauour of their friends, ruling both the King and the State, they are ſuborned, cleared of the cryme, and the poore Complainant, returned with a checke able to breake the heart of a ſimple man: abuſes which may be more lamented, then eaſily remedied.
            But touching the Mayden Knight, from whom I haue digreſt, I ſpeake not any thing to diſparage his loue, nor to draw your lyking from the Knight, but wiſh you temper your affection, in ſuch ſort, that you may long enioy it with content to you both, and ſo gouerne your Graces lookes and countenances, that the lightneſſe of the one, nor the liberall beſtowing of the other, giue iealous heads any cauſe of ſuſpition. For Princes be great markes, and haue many eies beholding them, and once perceiued, what peril it may procure to either part, your wiſedome can conceiue. Thus in dutie haue I ſpoken, and deliuered a groſſe aduiſe, which I referre to your Graces better conſideration. Well haſt thou ſaid, my Guenela, quoth the Princeſſe, but what auaileth counſell to a deſperate minde, no more then he that ſéeking to quench the flame, powreth Oyle to it, I finde thy loue ſo great towards me, that I cannot requite it, which with ſuch good regard balanceth each perill incident to both our ſtates, if thou canſt as well deuiſe how we may enioy our delight, without which we perplexed, cannot long endure, what is it that Nutania ſhall euer enioy, but Guenela ſhall command? Then as thou tendereſt my good, bethinke thée of ſome remedie, for my loue to him is ſuch, as nothing may extinquiſh. Say my ſwéet Guenela, ſhall I by writing anſwere his Letters, or no: In this I wil be ruled by thée, how gladly ſoeuer I wiſh his comfort, in whom, of al earthly creatures, conſiſteth my moſt comfort. Experience is the beſt wiſedome quoth Guenela, who would euer haue beléeued loues power to be of ſuch effect, how imperious ſoeuer he ſéemed, had they not ſéene and heard what I doo? through which I am compelled to recant my hereſie, and

ſay Loue is a God, or how is it poſſible he could command Princes. But to your Graces requeſt, wheras you haue referred the anſwere of Pheanders Letters to me, I was neuer ſo voyde of reaſon, nor ſo deſirous to be counſellor to your excellence, to take ſo great a matter vpon me, yet ſhal I (ſo pleaſe it you to heare me) deliuer my ſimple opinion, as I would do my ſelfe in the like action. The olde wiues ſay, they that féede with the deuill muſt haue a long ſpoone; and they that goe about to maſter Loue had néed of manie good precepts: diſſwade your Grace I will not to forget it, for▪ I ſée it is vain, neither would I wiſh you to anſwere by writing; for a paper is ſoone loſt, and loſt, to whoſe finding it ſhall come, tis vncertaine; as ſoone to ſome enuious enemie, as a wel-willer; in which ſome word ſimplie meant of you, or me, may be conſtrued by them at their pleaſure, whereby your name may be brought in queſtion; and a ſlaunder raiſed, is not ſo eaſily ſuppreſſed; writing is a ſpecialtie, whereof the ſubtill Lawyer takes no ſmall aduantage: to auoyd all which caſualties, this may you doe; pretend ſome matter of conference with him, and appoint the time when hée ſhall attende your pleaſure, at your lodging, comming ſecretely vnto you, and at ſuch time as the King your father ſhall bée employed in ſerious affaires, ſo may you vſe your ſpéech at your pleaſure; this would Guenela doe, your Grace may vſe your diſcretion.
            I like thy deuiſe wel (good wench) and giue thée manie thankes (quoth the Princeſſe) therefore faile not to méete him for thy promiſe, what els I refer to thy beſt indgemēt. Nowe in faith Madame (quoth Guenela) you haue made a good choyce for a ſolliciter, but take me as I am, this is the firſt ſuit that euer I was retained for nor I doubt not (if I ſpéed well now) of manie elpantes. As they were thus pleaſant betwéene themſelues, they heard a trumpet ſound to horſe, which cauſed the Princeſſe to ſende her Page to enquire the cauſe, who returned her anſwer, that the king with his traine, were ſetting forward to hunt a wilde bore,

which his Forreſter had rouſed: this newes gaue them cauſe of ioy, hoping that Fortune fauoured them with a happy time, which they were both loth to omit, doubting the like opportunitie; the Princeſſe eſpecially, who coulde not be quieted in minde, vntill ſhée heard her Knight aunſwere for himſelfe; wherefore a Page was preſently commanded to ſearch for ye Knight, willing him with ſuch conuenient ſpéed as hee could, to meet Guenela in the garden; the Page vſed ſuch diligence, ye ſoone he was brought vnto the Knightes preſence, whome he found ſolitary (as a holie father) at his Orizons, whome the Page awaked with his ioyful meſſage, which was welcom vnto him, albeit doubtfull whether of weale or woe, either to augment his ſorrowes, or vtterly to extinguiſh them. The ſudden hearing of which, cauſed him to pauſe a while, when hauing determined, curteouſly returned anſwere to the Gentlewoman, that he would attend her, he rewarded the Page ſo bountifully, as he had cauſe to boaſt him of his wel employed ſeruice. Guenela hauing receiued his anſwere by the Page, aduertized the Princeſſe thereof, who commaunded her to haſte, leaſt ſhe gaue the Knight cauſe of diſcontent by her long ſtay: but for al her ſpéed Pheander was long there before, attēding her comming; who was no ſooner of him perceiued to enter the place, but his heart pr
                  ••
               aging ſome good, was more delighted thereat, thē all the motions that could be imagined, after his curteous ſalutations done, thus ſaid:
            Swéet Guenela, I know not what to imagine of thy ſudden meſſage, yet willing to be reſolued, as one that by thy anſwer exſpecteth his doome either of life or death, I attend thy pleaſure: ſay therfore, ſwéet Lady, what faith the Princeſſe to my letters? with whom Guenela purpoſed to be ſomthing pleaſant, & not to cloy his ſtomacke with ſuch pleſant confections, that he ſhould ſurfet therewith, and framing a countenance to her ſpéech, ſhe ſaid:
            Sir Knight, of all the Gentlemen in the Courte of Thrace, my good opinion was ſuch of you, that on your

word, I durſt haue hazarded my greateſt credit, which expectation thou haſt farre deceiued: and therefore not worthie to be accounted among ſuch honorable men at Armes, which take their principall honor, holding their word with Gentlewomen. At the deliuery of which ſpéech, he that had tooke regarde to the Knightes countenaunce, might haue thought him paſt phiſickes recure: And withall, ſtanding ſo mute, it verely perſwaded Guenela, that he was readie to deliuer his intereſt of life, whiche made her alter her rough words, and with a ſmoother methode new file them; doubting that her Comedie begun in mirth, ſhould prooue a Tragidie, to the great grief of the whole Country, which generally honored him. Wherfore taking him by the hand, ſhe ſayd; Sir Knight, I am ſorie I haue charged you ſo far, what cauſe ſoeuer I had, but tis womanlike to be ſlaine with words, and no fit paſſion for a man of your profeſſion. That you may comfort your ſelfe, I firſt pardon the offence againſt me committed, (and enioyne you) as you tender your credit with the Princeſſe Nutania, that you faile not to repaire at ſuch conuenient time as you beſt can, to her lodging; where if you hold your word, you will excuſe your meſſenger.
            Oh Guenela, how haue thy ſpéeches tormented me, filling my entrailes with ſuche a confuſion of comfortleſſe thoughts, as haue ouercome my ſenees. Yet Guenela, if thou be curteous, or haue any ſparke of gentilitie abide in thée, Say my good Lady, what countenance gaue the Princeſſe to my baſhfull paper? Vouchſafed ſhe the reading of them? (Or how) to diſcomfort you good Knight, quoth Guenela, it were pittie, being alreadie at ſo low a datum, which pitieth me to behold. Comfort can I giue none to thy deſires but this, thy ſute is loue, as your Letters import, in which diſpaire not, for thy miſtreſſe is a woman, though a Princeſſe, and how pitifull our ſexe is, I will not boaſt, but wiſh thée not diſpaire: If thy birth were as great as thy vertues, thou mightſt boord and bedde, as good as the Princeſſe

Nutania, vnto whom I wil be a faithfull ſoliciter. Miſtake me not Pheander, I ſpeake as a friend, and ſo leaue thée, vntill thy comming to my Lady, which detract not, for time loſt, is ſuch a precious thing as can neuer be recalled. Before whom, when thou ſhalt come, pleade thine owne cauſe, and diſcouer thine owne grie. And ſo farewell.
            
               Pheander, which had ſome greater hope by Guenela, her laſt ſpéeches, was ſo ouer ioyed, that he could not bid her farewell: yet after his memento paſt, he ſaith, farewell the faithfulleſt friend in my diſtreſſe, that euer I founde. (Oh Guenela) happy maiſt thou be in thy loues, and highly honored amongſt men, by whom my cares are thus comforted, (faithfull Guenela) the worker of my hearts happie content, by whom paſt all hope, I am by thy faithfulneſſe and trueth in deliuering my meſſage, freed of ſo heauie a burthen, as was likely to haue torne my poore oppreſſed heart in a million of péeces. Thus vplawding Guenela, he had almoſt forgotten his word. Leauing further to deſcant on this plaine ſong, returne we to the Princeſſe, who was aduertiſed by her woman, what had paſſed betwéene the Knight and her, not omitting his heauy lookes, and pitifull ſpéeches. And then againe as glad to pleaſe the Princeſſe, whom ſhe was aſſured loued the Knight, letted not at large to ſet out his honors gained, his comelineſſe of perſon, bountie, and whatſoeuer the world admired in him, ſhe highly aduanced: to the great content of ye Princeſſe, who thought euery minute a yeare vntill ſhe ſaw him, whome ſhe with hartie deſire expected, (long looked for, comes at laſt.) And Nutania who at a caſement wayted diligently his cōming, eſpied her beloued Knight, what ioy it cauſed, let them iudge, which better experience haue made perfit in louers delights. The Princeſſe hauing the ſight of her ſo long deſired Knight, ſent Guenelia to entertaine him, and to bring him to her preſence. The Princeſſe ſtudying to frame her countenance for his welcome, bethought her ſelfe of ſundry meanes, eftſoones, doubting by her too pleaſant and kinde

vſage to be thought too forward in loue: then, what diſcomfort her heauy lookes might moue to him, whom ſhe moſt deſired to pleaſe. In this quandary, fitting on a Pallet, leaning her head on her pillowe, Guenela hath brought the Knight to her preſence, who doing his dutie, was by the Princeſſe againe ſaluted.
            Attending like the guiltie condemned, his ſentence from her mouth, which was to giue him either life or death, the Knight thus at an nonplus, ouercome with the beholding of the Princeſſe exellent perfection, was by her the mirror of all honor and curteſie, remoued out of his dumpes, in this maner.
            Sir Pheander, whether I ſhould chaſtice thy preſumption in writing ſo boldly vnto me (or no) I am not yet reſolued, but before I acquainted my father therewith, I thought good to heare thée ſpeake, for that I would not ſodeinly diſgrace thée, whom I haue ſo often graced: as well to heare thy intent committing ſo great a follie, as what thou canſt ſay in excuſe thereof. Princes are not to be ieaſted with, nor to be attempted in ſuch maner by their inferiours, and therefore thou haſt highly erred in that thou haſt done, and encurred the daunger of our ſtricteſt lawes, by which thou art already cōdemned, were thy fact known. The Knight ſtanding at the bar, where Bewlie ſat chiefe Iudge, was ſurprized with ſo many griefes, that he might hardly vtter any word, yet reuiued by hope of thoſe comfortable and ſwéete wordes pronounced by Guenela, hée ſaith;
            Gracious Lady, that I haue preſumed farre, I cannot but acknowledge, yet that I haue encurred ſuch puniſhment as your highneſſe inferreth, I deny, vnleſſe death be the guerdon aſſigned the faithfull; (for dutifull ſeruice) and entire affection, vrged me to ſéeke thy fauour in loue, without which I may not liue: ſo déepely is thy vertuous perfections imprinted in my heart, which if I enioy not, I deſire no longer to breathe. Therefore Madame, if thou diſdaine

his loue, that liuing, dieth continually for thée: doo but ſay the word, and this blade ſo often imbrued in the blood of mine enemies, ſhall ſacrifice his maiſters owne true heart before thy face, that thy cruell ſelfe, (maiſt witneſſe to thy ſelfe) how faithfully thy ſeruant hath loued thée.
            The Princeſſe gréeued to heare theſe ſpéeches, moued with great ruth, could hardly forbeare ſheading of teares, yet modeſtie the ornament of womankinde, cauſed her to feine a counterfeit ſhow of diſpleaſure to him, whoſe teares wroong droppes of blood from her tender heart, yet that ſhe might not too ſodeinly confeſſe her hearts deſire, nor giue him cauſe of vtter diſpaire, ſhe ſaith; Pheander, that thou maiſt ſée, and ſéeing, report in all places where euer thou ſhalt become of womens pitie, I grant thée pardon for thy fault, and with my pardon, thy life, which was wholly in me to diſpoſe. For louing me as thy Prince, I heartily thanke thée, but in ſéeking to obtaine my loue as thy wife, that haue bene denied to diuerſe and ſundrie Princes, in that thou erreſt: let each eſtate frame themſelues in loue to their equall, ſo ſhall they ſooner obtaine their deſires, and their loues in more tranquilitie be mainteined. Thou knoweſt thy birth how baſe it is, and though for thy vertues it pleaſed my Princely father to aduance thée, who cannot of his Princely nature, but rewarde the d
                  •
               ſerts of the well deſeruing. If for his good to thée, thou ſéeke to robbe him of his childe, therein thou ſheweſt a verie vngratefull minde, and laieſt open to the world thy baſe condition. Therefore perſiſt to proſecute thy ſute, let reaſon vanquiſh that brain-ſicke humor which ſo afflicts thée; in doing which, thou ſhalt ſhewe thy ſelfe, to be thy ſelfe: For no greater conqueſt can be atchieued, then conquering a mans owne effects. Doo this, and thou ſhalt finde Nutania thy faithfull and aſſured friend, who will be as carefull to aduaunce thée, as I haue found thée readie to pleaſure me.
            
               Alas good Madame, anſwered the Knight, I haue often heard, the whole néeds no phiſition, it is eaſier far to giue counſell then to take it. The full gorged Churle litle regardeth the ſtaruing creature at his gate, (but madame) could you conceiue the leaſt part of many thouſand griefes that afflict me, you would pitie me at leaſt, though you yéelded me no farther fauour: If thy heart be not harder then the Adamant, (pittie me) ſwéete Lady, and yéeld thy grace, to augment my life, or vtterly deny me your fauour for euer. I exſpect but your anſwere, for my reſolution is no other then I haue profeſt, (daſtards feare to die) but the Noble minde preferreth death which endeth all ſorrowes, before a life to be continued with diſcontent. The Princeſſe which was at her wits end as full of griefe, as he of ſorow, turned her ſpéeches from her matter, to queſtion him of his Country, the maner of the Court, and ſtate therof, thinking ſo to be guilde the time and put him off for that ſeaſon. But ſo long dalied ſhe, that ſhe was forced in the end to confeſſe her loue to be no way inferior to his. Thus as I haue ſaid, demaunding of the Knight many queſtions, ſhe earneſtly entreated him, to reſolue her whether the Prince Dionicus, were ſuch as the world reported him, who had name to be a Paragon, excelling in all actions required in a Noble man. The Prince hearing his name called in queſtion by the Princeſſe, on ſuch a ſodaine, beléeued verily that ſhe had ſome ſecret knowledge of him, which made him with bluſhing chéekes to ſay, what reportes ſoeuer your Grace hath heard of that Prince Dionicus, I know not, a ſubiect I was to his father, and ought to ſpeake reuerently of him, (yet what is truth) and not for affection or deſpighte, to ſay other then I will with my blood auow. Wherefore Noble Lady, I will truly anſwere your demaunds.
            The Prince whoſe father was matchleſſe, gaining the loue of all men, with care and honor mainteined the reputation of his Countrey, which by his careleſſe ſonne is blemiſhed, who neglecting the dutie of a child, without regard

of father, crowne, or kingdome, exiled himſelfe, no man knowes where, or whether he reſt aliue or no: ſince which time, the king his father, who loued him too dear (if fathers loue may be too deare) hath likewiſe abſented himſelfe, and liueth in exile. The mother Quéen, hath reſigned her due to death, leauing (by loſſe of thoſe honorable perſons) their country without a head, and their ſtate by ſubiectes to bée gouerned, wherby a ruine of the kingdom is like to enſue, all procéeding from the Prince. A miſerable country is that (quoth the Princaſſe) & to be lamented; but more the loſſe of ſo noble a race, the father hauing bene ſuch, and the ſonne as (report ſaith) ſo toward. But ſay (good Knight) quoth ſhe, was there neuer cauſe ſuppoſed of their departures? nor did not the father through his harſh demeanor, for youth in theſe times take vnkindly their fathers vnkindnes: & age is froward, which frowardnes might miniſter great cauſe of diſcontent. Madam (quoth the Knight) to my knowledge, this I wil ſay, my father being a Courtier in ſome regard, whereby I became familiar with the Prince, and as youth will make choiſe of ſome one to participate with, ſo it pleaſed the Prince, louing my father wel, to vſe my company in all his exerciſes; through which I ſaw his demeanor, with ſuch reuerent duetie to the king acknowledged, and as kindly requited of the king, as on the earth might not bee found loue more perfect til his ſpeach fayling in his mouth, he could vtter no more. The Princeſſe giuing héed to each word by him pronounced, albeit ſhe ſawe the repeating of the Princes life, was ſomewhat cumberſome vnto him, yet ceaſed he not to vrge him, to ſhew ſuch ſorrowe in deliuering the ſtorye ſo of her deſired. Ah Madame (quoth the knight) at his departure, began our Countries grief and my ſorrow, from whome in life, I could neuer bée ſeperated, ſuch was my loue to him, which refuſed himſelfe, his Crowne, and dignities. Adolefull tale haſt thou deliuered (quoth the Princeſſe) which I perceiue mooueth you to impacience, wherefore, one demaund and an ende. The

Prince Dionicus, made choyſe of you, for his companion: Then vnder benedicitie let me craue (all law of friendſhip exempted) did he not acquaint you with his determinations? for me thinkes it is ſcant credible, that ſuch an vnity ſhould be amongſt men, their loues being ſo perfect, but he ſhould diſcloſe each ſecret intent whatſoeuer: many reaſons draweth me to ſuppoſe it, which I will omit, for I perceiue I am too tedious. Your Ladiſhip vrgeth me far, yet will I accompliſh your requeſt, who haue power to commaund me. The Gentleman who neuer offended, but in committing of this great offence, long before his departure, hauing belike ſome motion of deſire in his thoughtes, became of a pleaſant Gentleman, the moſt melancholieſt that could be found; that quite aboliſhing all company, hée beſt contented himſelfe with his ſecrete cogitations; continuing this homour ſo long, that he fell ſicke of an extream Feuer; which ſo encreaſed vpon him, as all Phyſickes reliefe was quite giuen ouer: ſo that ſmall was the hope of his recouerie, whoſe diſtreſſe, the kind King, with the mother Quéene, grieued in ſuch wiſe to beholde, as in ſhorte time it was hard to be iudged which of the thrée endured moſt extreames. But God that in aduerſity ſends comfort, reſtored the Prince to ſome ſtrēgth: belike receiuing ſome comfort in his imaginations, & by his recouery, the King & Quéene were both ſo comforted, as in ſhort time they were raiſed from their ſicke cabinets, to frolike it amongſt their noble ſubiects, who ioyed in nothing ſo much as in their healthes. But how ſoone the Sunſhine of their happineſſe was ouerſhadowed with cloudes of comfortleſſe care, grieueth me to recount; yet dare I not gainſay your Ladiſhips requeſt. The Prince recouered of his maladie, made ſemblance of ſuch content, that none but himſelfe could witneſſe vy the leaſt ſuſpition, his hearts diſcontent, yet oftentimes ſhould I, being ſeldome from his company, ſighing with a number of far fetched ſobs, heare him ſay, Péerleſſe Ladie, would my loue were as wel known to thée as to mine own

heart, then doubtles wouldſt thou pitie me which lanquiſh for thée, that art the only Princeſſe on the earth, excelling in al vertues which beautifie the honourable; the report of which hath fettered my fancies to thée, that I proteſt to bée thine, or neuer mine owne: then looking with a gaſtly loook about him, to ſée if any ouerheard him, hee woulde fall into ſome other diſcourſe, euer applauding ye rare perfections of his miſtreſſe, who was vnknowne to all but only to himſelf & I, who frō the firſt he acquainted with ye ſame: briefly Lady, (for I weary you with my diſcourſe) the loue of his Lady hath drawn him from his country, whoſe abſence cauſed the kings exile, & the Kings exile the Quéens death.
            The Princeſſe hearing all theſe extreams to grow from affection, knowing well her owne hearts diſcontent, with a ſigh from the déepeſt, which wroong tears from her heart, ſhe ſaid; Alaſſe noble Gentleman, whoſe ioy ſo ſoone ouerwhelmed, hath heaped ſo many cares vpon me, what folly was there in thée, that wouldeſt not diſcloſe thy loue which burned ſo vehementlie: was the dame ſo baſe, that thou feareſt thereby to ignoble thy iſſue, or of ſuch high eſtate thou doubteſt to obtaine her; if either, by perſwaſions all griefs might haue bene mittigated: if a Monarch, why thou by report deſerueſt her; if a begger, thou mighteſt make her noble; what ere ſhe were hearing thy diſtreſſe, could ſhe forbeare to pitie thée? No, no, were her heart more harder then the Diamond, it could not chooſe at ye hearing therof, but relent: elſe, wel woorthy were ſhe to bée ſcorned of al Ladies, and neuer to bee named amongſt the number of women.
            The Prince ſéeing the Princeſſe in this pitiful humour, thought it good ſtriking whē the iron was hot, & taking the opportunity, anſwered her thus: Is your Ladiſhips cenſure ſuch of hard-hearted Ladies, & wil not be entreated of him, whoſe loue to you, is no whit inferior to the Pr. Dionicus, as himſelf wold confeſſe wer he preſent, & hard me recount ye many griefs, wherwith loue hath afflicted me: & might he 
                  •
               e Iudge, wold allow me recōpence for my ſeruice in loue.

But Madame, if without offence I might demaund this; ſay Nutania, the Princeſſe of Thrace were the Saint, vnto whome this vnhappie Prince had vowed his deuotions, and that all the paſſions he hath endured▪ are for your loue, would you vouchſafe him loue in recompence thereof? The Princeſſe driuen to her ſhiftes at this demaund, could not tell what to anſwere, yet ſharpening her wittes (as women can doe) ſhe ſaid: Pheander, Loue is not to bée dallied with, as I haue heard them ſay, which ſpeake by experience; therefore I cannot directly anſwere thy queſtion, but were I the Phyſitian that could cure his maladie, and had ſo good iudgement of his affects as of mine owne, charity would I ſhoulde miniſter vnto his diſeaſe, what effect ſoeuer the potion would worke; prouided this, that he diſcloſed his griefe in time: miſtake me not Pheander, and pardon mée if I conceale what I would vtter, my thoughtes are mine owne. Trueth Ladie (quoth the Knight) neither was ye ſame demaunded to vrge any thing more thē ſtandeth with your good liking: yet for the prince; this I ſay, it were pittie he ſhoulde die for loue. So ſay I, (quoth the Princeſſe) for few men ther be of that condition, and as ſeldome is ſuch a one ſéene, as multitudes of blacke Swans. Your errour is great, Madam, (quoth the knight) for many haue bene with loue ſo ouercome, that Kinges haue bene enforced to ſtoop to their ſubiectes, and the greateſt conquerours, whoſe valour many volumes recorde, by loue compelled to forſake themſelues, taking ſundrie ſhapes and many toyles, to gaine the loue of their Ladies. I ſpeake now Madam for the Prince, whom I loue well, and challenge your charity may bee to him continued, for your loue is the only phyſick that muſt cure him, or els all other helps are friuolous: in hope wherof, he breaths a lingring life, til your gracious conſent finiſh his griefs, yéelding to his deſires, in whom it reſteth, to reſtore him; baniſhed, to his regal dignities, who is y• cauſe of his exile: daſtardneſſe hath cauſed him to conceale it, bearing the extremitie

of his paſſions with intollerable pain, whoſe flames encreaſeth by viewing your exellent perfections; The want of whoſe grace, haleth him on to deſperation, not able any longer to reſiſt loues aſſaults, which with ſuch hot allarmes aſſaileth him, that longer he cannot endure them. The Princeſſe hearing her Knight pleade for the Prince with ſuch earneſtneſſe, leauing his owne ſute, to draw her to loue him of whom her thoughts were leaſt on, thought it ſome pollicy of the Knight, which imagined loue had vanquiſhed her, ſwelling with anger at theſe new imaginations, he
                  •
                colour changed into ſo many formes, that the leaſt child which had ſéene the ſame, might eaſily haue geſt what ſmall content thoſe laſt vttered ſpéeches wrought. But doubting leaſt with ſilence it ſhould be perceiued, with a heart full fraught with fury, ſhe ſayd; Deceitfull wretch, vnworthy the fauour of the ſimpleſt drug, that by thy ſubtil practiſes haſt ſought to inſinuate thy ſelfe into my ſecrets, was it not falſe varlet, ſufficient that I forbeare the puniſhing of thy own bold writings, but to my face in colorable maner, deludeſt me with tales of I know not what. Haue I euer graced thée ſince I firſt ſawe thée, and requiteſt thou my fauour thus, dallying with me as with thy inferiour, or ſome of thy baſe Trulles? No, no, vſe thy ieaſt with ſuch that can better diſgeſt them, and from henceforth be warned, (and warned) take héed how thou dare either by word or writing, vſe any like motions, leaſt I acquaint y• world with thy impotent dealings, and by death thou receiue the guerdon of thy ill: and ſo fare as thou maiſt, for neuer expect farther fauour at my hands.
            The Prince hearing this finitiue ſentence, from her, whoſe tongue was to pronounce his life or death, thought it high time to ſpeake for himſelfe before ſhe departed, and ſtaying her as ſhe would haue gone, he humbly beſought her, not in diſpleaſure to leaue him, but with patience endure what he could ſay: which albeit ſhe might hardly be wonne to grant, yet her former affection baniſhed chollor

in ſuch wiſe, that he had libertie to ſpeake, ſaying;
            Gracious Lady, that I offended your Exellence, whom of all earthly creatures I moſt honor, I hartily ſory for it, iudge me not ſo impudēt or ſenſleſſe, to moue matter without ſome reaſon, eſpecially enduced therunto by your exellent fauour, and charitable pittie of the wretched eſtate of that vnhappie Prince, who hath vowed to loue your grace to the death: and by granting him your loue, you ſhall draw him from death, & thereby not onely reſtore him, but fill the hearts of many thouſands with ioy, which with teares continually lamenteth his loſſe, which is loſt to them for euer, and ſhortly will be loſſe to himſelfe & the whole world. Vnhappy Prince, why name I him Prince, whoſe miſeries is more thē the moſt wretched ſlaue that liueth, who not able to endure the force of loue, hath forſaken himſelfe, to follow his own affectiōs, without knowledge of father, kin, or ſubiects. Muſe not Madam, at the ſtraungeneſſe of the Tale I haue to deliuer, nor let it ſéeme incredible, that I am that vnhappy Dionicus, lawfull heire of the Numedian Crown, that Prince, through whom ſo many miſeries is befallen his country, his fathers care, & cauſe of his careful mothers vntimely death, who fettred in loues bands, by report of thy péerleſſe bewtie & vertues, hath drawne me to take the habit of a merchant, vſurping the name of Pheander, the more vnſuſpected to attain the ſight of thée whom my heart ſo deſired: whom if thou pitie, liueth by thy loue to do thée honor, and without thée, may no longer inioy this life; in purſuit of whoſe loue, if I die, my ghoaſt among the reſt of louers▪ ſhal ſing hymnes in laude of thy péerleſſe bewtie.
            The Princeſſe as one in a trance, could not tel whether ſhe heard him ſpeak, or dreamed, yet noting his countenāce which ſhewed a troubled ſpirit, tickled with a ſodain ioy, as women be proud in their Loues, that her loue to Pheander, was methamorphoſed to Dionicus, the Numedian Prince, of whome her fathers Courtiers reported ſuch honours, ſhe ſayd; Pheander, or how I ſhall call thée I know not,

thou haſt filled my ſences with a world of cōfuſed thoghts, in recounting the ſtraungeneſſe of thy fortunes, which I can hardly be drawne to beléeue, nor is it poſſible that the Prince Dionicus could liue in the Court of Thrace, ſo long concealed, without knowledge of ſome one, if I might by reaſon be induced to beléeue the ſame, I would ſay more▪ Madam quoth the Prince, howſoeuer I haue diſguiſed my ſelfe heretofore, as loth to be diſhonored, yet beléeue me in this, that I ſaid no more then is truth. Therefore if thou couldſt not loue Pheander being a merchant, for ignobling thy noble houſe, yet as I am Prince of Numedia, vouchſafe me thy liking, by whome thy honor can no way be diſparaged, but by exchanging loue for loue with him, aduance thy honor far higher. Say n
                  •
               w Madame, all niceneſſe ſet apart, can you loue?
            The Princeſſe, whoſe loue was equall, though willingly ſhe would haue coloured the ſame, yet moued with a pitifull deſire to eaſe his griefe, which farre ſurpaſſed, as alſo to eaſe her owne heart which was not a litle infected with the ſelf diſeaſe, their welfares depending both on her grant or deniall. After ſhe had deliberated a while, fixing her hand in his, which ſhe eaſily graſped, and leaning her head on his ſhoulder to couer ye bluſhing of her face, as aſhamed of what ſhe had to ſay vnto him, in reuealing her owne griefe, ſhe ſaid;
            Famous Prince, whome the world applaudeth, and our Courtiers of Thrace, with wonder do admire, that I loued thée being Pheander, I cannot deny, and how many iarres I endured for thée, I omit: each particuler, wringing tears from my heart, which how willing ſo euer it was to haue made the ſame knowne, modeſtie reſtrained, laying before me many wrongs offred in Ladies loue, by ſuch periured knights, as haue profeſt with their toongs what their harts neuer ment, wherby diuers Ladies of honor, haue bene diſhonored, & ſundry loſt their liues, (which conſidered) blame me not, if I rather chuſe to die, then paſſe the bandes

of modeſtie ſo farre, as ſeeke thy loue, or knowing thy grief, to blame mine, (yéeld) before I heard thée auow on thine honor, what thy letters imported. But gentle Prince, that thou maiſt better beléeue what I report, how much ſoeuer my heart hath denied to reueale, perſwade thée, if I loued thée being Pheander, and a counterfeyt merchant, aſſure you, I cannot hate thée for that thou art Dionicus, (the one a Prince) the other an inferiour, of whoſe loue were I aſſured, and that his tongue and heart agreed in one, Dionicus, ſhould be in loue ſo requited, as neuer any ſhould haue intereſt in Nutanias heart, but the péerleſſe Prince of Numedia. At vttering of which, teares reſtrained her ſpéech, which ye Prince noted, and perceiuing that ſhe ſpake what her heart thought, he 
                  •
               omforted her thus.
            Faint not Madame, neither ſorrow for thoſe comfortable confections beſtowed on a dying creature, whoſe fauors hath haled him from the graue, whereunto he was like to haue bene ſwallowed, had not thy comfort reclaimed mée, who liuing, died for thy loue, which grace ſhall neuer be forgotten. And that you ſhall aſſure you my faith and loue is firme and honorable, I proteſt by that honor that euer the Numedian Prince hath regarded, that my loue to the Princeſſe Nutania, is no other but honourable, nor neuer none hath had any intereſt in Dionicus, or euer ſhall, but the onely bewtifull, and verteous Princeſſe Nutania: and on that, take here my hand, and with my hand, the heart, loue, and honor of a Prince. Guenela, lending an eare to this prattle, hearing them ſo earneſt, to put them from their melancholy, tooke the word at aduantage, and comming ſodeinly to them, ſaid; Madame, at finiſhing of bargains they ſhake hands, if there be any exchange betwéene your knight and you, you were beſt to take witneſſe, leaſt diſliking the match, he recant his word. Guenela, quoth the Prince, your Lady is beholding to thée for thy care, (and I) your debter, challenge it when you pleaſe. Sir, quoth Guenela, I thank you, but wilt pleaſe you remember your promiſe, & excuſe

               Guenela (quoth the Princeſſe) without my Lord y• Prince his further intreaty, I pardon al faults committed againſt me; for confirmation of which, get your Lawyer to draw an acquittance generall from the beginning of the world, and I will ſigne it.
            Nay Madame (anſwered Guenela,) it were an euil ſeruant that will not take her miſtreſſe worde for a dozen or two of ſtripes, which I am ſure had bene the moſt, and if they ſhould light on my ribbes, might well grieue me, ſlay me they could not, my heart is of more valour then ſo. But Madame, ſhal Sir Pheander marie the Princeſſe Nutania, that you call him your Lord the Prince? if that be the bargaine, I feare there is ſome fire in the ſtrawe. And howe then (quoth the Princeſſe?) Nay Madame (quoth Guenela) nothing, but I pray God giue you much ioy, and make you happy in your loue. While they were thus pleaſant, a page brought word that diuers Ladies were come to viſite the Princeſſe, which cauſed them, how loth ſo euer, after manie ſwéet imbracings and louing kiſſes, betwéene them enterchanged, to giue each other the farewel, parting better content, then they came together, hauing vnburthened their heartes of much griefes, giuing content to both, by yéelding to loue, which vanquiſhed both, whome to their pleaſing imaginations I leaue, to recount the Kinges of Thrace, and Theſſalie, their paſtimes in hunting. Theſe Kinges following the chace with great pleaſure, as paſtime they greatly delighted, were ſo wearied with the ſame, and toiled with the extremity of heate, which made them chooſe ſome place vnder the ſhadowe of the ſpreading trées to refreſh themſelues, where they had not long reſted, but they were eſpied of an ancient woman, the widdow of good ye
                  •
               
               man, and her ſonne, who hauing workmen not farre from thence, were carrying them victuals. The poore aged woman hauing ſéene (as ſhe thought vnſéene) the kings, doubting they were ſome of thoſe robbers, that haunted thoſe mountains, woulde haue ſhifted from them another way,

but were interrupted of the King, who ſuddeinly calling them, draue them both into ſuch a ſhaking feare, as they which are ouerburthened with a feauer. The King who graciouſly regarded their timmorouſneſſe, comforted them with all the fauourable ſpéeches he could vſe, proteſting vnto them, that in their company they ſhould receiue no diſcurteſie, by none, if the King himſelfe were preſent, and therefore willed them to ſet feare apart, and to tell them what they were, the cauſe of their feare, and their buſineſſe they had that way? Theſe honorable ſpéeches of the King mildly vttered, comforted them, wherefore in ſuch blunt manner as her bringing vp required, ſhée ſayd;
            Gentlemen, for ſo you ſéeme, if your inward conditions, anſwere your outward habit, (as many in this age doeth) whoſe garments might become men of great worth, if apparell may make a man more worthie, yet diuerſe times couer thoſe carkaſes, voyd either of worſhip, honeſtie, or other good condition. Pardon my harſh behauiour, (gentle ſir) and blame me not for auoiding the way, experience ha

            The King delighted with her plaine ſpéeches, demanded where ſhe dwelled, and whether ſhe had a huſband, or liued a widow? Oh ſir, if any gentilneſſe abide in you, (quoth ſhe) vrge me not to deliuer a tale of ſuch ruth, as your queſtions import. The remembrance of my paſſed pleaſant life, when I call to minde, with the cares I now am combred with, many ſundry wayes, are ſo diſpleaſing vnto my gréeued heart, as I may not without many teares ſhed, recount the ſame. Theſe words ſpoken in heauineſſe, noted of the King, made him more importunate to heare the reſt, and therfore willed her all feare ſet apart, to reueale vnto him, what eſtate ſhe liued in, and if any wrongs were offred hir,

he proteſted by oathes which might haue bene well beléeued, to remedie it, yea if it were the King himſelfe. The carefull widow encouraged by theſe comfortable words, albeit ſhe hoped of ſmall reliefe from him, partly to eaſe her heart, and a litle to diſgrace her aduerſary which was mightie, all the reuenge ſhe could take, thus ſaid;

fixed, where their cauſe ſhould bee heard and reſtitution made, which in ſuch ſort was accompliſhed, that his lands, leaſes, plate and Iewels, were diſtributed to the wronged. The widow who firſt gaue notice thereof, the King enriched with greater poſſeſſions to maintaine her hoſpitality, and Zachary for that his Dania ſhuld not for want of welth refuſe him, he bountifully rewarded, ſo that euery one was pleaſed, and returned content to their homes.
            Now Gentiles, the Hiſtory ſhall ſhews you how Theophilus King of Theſſaly, expected the ayd of Thrace, for reſtoring him to his kingdom, which promiſe the King ſo regarded, that in ſhort time, through the diligence of thoſe Captains to whom the charge therof was committed, the number appointed was furniſhed, with ſhipping, munition and victualls, for the Army, of whome the Thracian king tooke the Muſter, appointing their leaders. The chiefe (by name of Generall) for the ſeruice, was the Mayden Knight, who was vrged vnto it by the two kings, in ſuch maner, that no excuſes nor delaies which he could make, might be accepted, vnleſſe he ſhould by his too much refuſall, purchaſe the name of coward: this choyſe greatly diſliked the Knight, whoſe warres in loue, had but newly begunne to take ſucceſſe, who ſcarcely aſſured of the Princeſſe, although her promiſed faith might put him in comfort, yet weighing the vnſtability of their ſexe, he doubted leaſt his abſence might drawe her to that which he would héedfully regarde being preſent. The tydings of her fathers election, made of her loue for generall, as nouelties are rife and flieth with ſwift wings, came vnto the hearing of the Princeſſe, vnto whom if they were irkſome, ſuppoſe you, that know how gréeuous the parting of two faithfull louers are, who hauing her only felicitie in contemplating of her beloued Dionicus, their ioyes but now in the bloſſomes, was ſo nipt in the ſpring, as care baniſhed all future happineſſe, and ſorrow began to claime her w
                  •
               nted place in both, but eſpecially the Princeſſe who framed of the weaker mould, heauineſſe had taken

the more impreſſion in her, ſo that forſaking all company, her chéefeſt delight was to be ſolitary, where ſhee might with déepe ſighes and many bryniſh teares, vnburthen her ouercharged heart, curſing bitterly the cauſe, and cauſer of ſeperating her loue. In this melancholy vttering ſuch ſpéech of diſpaire, as though ſhée ſawe the dreadfull meſſenger Death, alreadie ſeized vpon the valiant knight. The knight who could take as litle reſt, as his Lady pleaſure, could finde content in no place, vntill hée came to the Princeſſe lodging, whome founde in this paſſion, which was more gréeuous then all the reſt, her blubbred eyes preſſyng bloud from his heart, beholdyng her in that plight, whoſe happy content, was his onely ioy. But how cumberſome ſo euer it was vnto him, with wiſdome hée aduiſedly weighed, that cares muſt be comforted in tyme, leaſt takyng déepe roote, they will conſume the heart ſubiect vnto it. Therefore after many kynde perſwaſions vſed, hée layde before her, the honour of the place aſſigned him, and what infamy woulde redownde vnto him refuſing it, with the diſhonour of him, and ſtaine to his Proginy for euer, the cauſe being right, and the action of her Princely father ſo charitable, whereon the welfare of a whole kingdome conſiſted.
            The Princeſſe whome gréefe had neare ouercome, hearing her beloued ſpeake ſo honourably, and well conſidering it was greatly to his infamie, to denye her father, though hardly wonne to patience, yet armed with hope of his valour and fortunate ſucceſſe in his iourney, reaſon and wiſedome ſubduing griefe and ſorrow, ſhée graunteth her conſent, heartily praying for his ſafe and ſuddaine returne, to his eternall honour, and encreaſing of the hearts content.
            Tyme that ſtaieth not, cauſeth theſe Princes to part, Pheander, to giue directions for his iourney, his prouiſion being all to make, but ſuch care had he of the ſame, as hée was ſodeinly prouided of all néedfull things, expſecting a

faire wind for imbarquing his companies, which God ſent as they deſired, when ech one taking leaue of their friends, with many a loath departing farewell, hée betooke himſelfe to the mercy of the waues, who by his goodneſſe, that commaundeth and gouerneth all things, fauoured them with ſo happie a gale, that in ſhort time they might diſcry the high lande of Egipt, which being by his ſkilfull Pylottes knowne, they ſtrooke their ſayles to Hull, vntill a generall Councell was called, where euery man had libertie to deliuer his aduiſe for the benefit of the action. Where after long debating, and eache perill aduiſedly weyghed, it was determined, the Fléete ſhould put againe into the Sea, leaſt they being a huge number ſhould be diſcried, and their intent thereby made fruſtrate. To bring their purpoſe to better effect, a Frygate was ſlenderly manned to auoyd ſuſpition, who in the night rowed hard aboord the ſhoare, with Commiſſion to take what ere hée were they could firſt lay holde off, that they might be the rather aduertiſed of the ſtate of the Countrey, and where the King was.
            This deuiſe ſorted to ſuch effect, thet through the great diligence of the Lord Cariolus, who was appointed for the ſame, as one deſirous to gaine honour, by dawning of the day they recouered a Rocke, which opened with one of their principall port, vnder which vnſéene, they might ſhelter themſelues, and yet haue ſight of eache ſhallop, whether hée were fiſher or other, that came or went. Long had they not laine exſpecting their deſires. But Fortune, who fauoured their enterpriſe, diſcouered vnto them a a Galley bounde for Babylon, fraighted with many paſſengers of honour, and exceeding rich, with plate, money and Iewels. This Galley firſt diſcryed, halfe diſmayed the company, who feared ſhée▪ had bene a man of warre ſent of purpoſe to ſurpriſe them, ſo that each one had greater deſire to be gone againe, then to attempt any thing againſt them. But in extreames is the Noble minde

beſt tried, as the Lord Cariolus in this, who ſéeing the cowardiſe of ſuch baſe companions, firſt by faire perſwaſions encouraged them to the attempt, ſhewing in his countenance his reſolution, and arming them with hope of victorie, not omitting the reward of ſo honourable an action, which if they eſcaped with victorie being the beginning of their enterpriſe, deſerued more to be recompenced then all the reſt. To giue you courage my hearts (quoth he,) I ſay not to you go, but follow me your Leader, who will either winne her, or leaue my life in ſo good a cauſe. But theſe ſpéeches with thoſe daſtards preuailed not at all, who ſéeing the match vnequall, cryed ſtil to be gone, but Cariolus, who weighed his honor farre aboue all, moued with great impatience at their deniall, with his Rapier drawne came amongſt them, reuiling them with odious ſpéeches, and proteſting what ere he were that ſhould in the leaſt ſort either by word or countenance, make ſhow to return, ſhould with his own hand be murdered, and ſo long as he might breath, no faint hearted villaine ſhould diſhonor him, who came to gaine honor. Therefore ſwéete blouds (quoth he,) take courage and feare not, death with honor, is to be valued more then life, with a kingdomes poſſeſſion, who ſo followeth me, ſhall finde me euer his friend, and what ere I poſſeſſe, ſhall haue intereſt in it. The company how loath ſo euer they were to be wonne to ſo hard an aduenture, yet ſéeing the noble man ſo reſolute, thought it bootleſſe to refuſe him, or to make ſemblant of diſlike, holding it more wiſedome to kéepe his honorable friendſhip by their forward aduenturing, then procure his enuy by their cowardiſe, and ſeeing it high time to reſolue, the galley approaching them neare, they cried to procéed, and they would all follow him, Cariolus pleaſed with their willingnes, had ſcarce leiſure to giue directions for the fight▪ before the galley came within hayling, whoſe force being ſuch and ſo wel manned as ſhe was, made ſmall account of the Frygat, who although they halled many times, yet making as if they heard not, bore vp

with them, and valiantly without words, entered her in the Prow, putting them from their Ordinance, where they within boord with their Piſtolles, Semitaries, and other néedfull weapons, valiantly behaued themſelues, Cariolus crying ſtill courage, courage, Theſſalie, ſo long that in ſhort time the Cauileres were all ſtowed, and his company leauing his Frygat entered all the Galley, as lawfull Prize to be ſhared amongſt them. The Noble Cariolus hauing ended the fight, he kindly with words of fauour and promiſe of libertie, with great reward to the ſlaues, vrged them to apply their labor, which with ſo willing hearts accompliſhed his requeſt, that in ſhort time they had ſight of their Fléete, and beare with them all they might, which being deſcried, they could not imagine whether the Galley were friend or no, wherefore the Generall to auoyd perill, as wiſedome with valour is requiſit, doubting that by firing or other miſchiefe, they might annoy them, he called by his flage of Councell, the commanders of each ſhip, frygat and galley, aduiſing them to take great regarde, how they ſuffered the galley to boord them. By that time the whole Fléete was prepared in ſquadrons, rowing fiue and fiue, warlike and braue, Cariolus came vp with them, when the fléete halled them, they eſpied his owne cullors aduanced on the Poope, and an other Enſigne hanging vnder her ſterne, which ſight gaue them great cauſe of ioy, to ſignifie their gladnes for his ſucceſſe, each ſhip in the foreward with their Ordinance and ſmall ſhot, according to the maner of the ſea, bad him welcome. In which Tryumph, vnhappily with a ſcowrer which negligently was ſhot from a Hargub
                  •
               ze, was the Noble Cariolus wounded, to the great griefe of all the Nobles. The Generall hauing vnderſtanding therof, in his ſhalop boorded him withall the ſpéed he might, carrying with him his owne Surgion, and ſuch as profeſſed phiſick, doubting the griefe to be more dangerous then it proued, whereof, albeit the report was firſt offenſiue to him, yet was comforted in this comfort, the wounde not

mortall, they regarding it as nothing, when the Generall had carefully ſéen the wound ſearched and dreſt, enquiring what they were which he had taken, he cauſed all the chief of them to be called vnto him, who on their examinations would confeſſe little, which forced the Generall to put one of ye inferiors, attendant on Phidamia, the Egyptian kings brother, to be tortured, who forced with the crueltie thereof, confeſſed what they were, and how their going for Babylon, was to intreate a peace with the Emperour, who as they were informed, leuied a power to ſubuert their countrey, in reuenge of the wrong offered Phedera, ſiſter to the Theſſalian King, ſlaine in a battaile fought at ſea, by the Egyptian King. This newes was not ſooner reuealed then welcome, for hereby they were aſſured of an expected frend, yet enquired the Generall, whether their King had married the Princeſſe Phedera, or no, and where hée liued? Sir quoth the Egyptian, after the victory obtained, wherein the Noble Theophilus periſhed, the King my maiſter, furniſhed for ſuche an attempt, without further ſtaie or ſuffering them to gather head, which he was ſure they would doo, hearing of their Kings ill ſucceſſe: to preuent which, he framed his courſe thither, where they ſuddeinly arriued, and by their power and pollicie, ſubdue the chiefeſt of the Nobilitie, who hauing them ſure, they eaſily and in ſhort time, ouercame the reſt, where he was by generall voyces (though) againſt their liking, Crowned King of Theſſaly. How hée puniſhed the Nobilitie, I omit, embacing them, and raiſing in their places them farre vnworthie ſuch honor and reputation, ſo that neither Gentleman or other of account, but liueth in great ſeruitude and ſlauery, glad to be reléeued with néedfull vyands and apparrell, at their handes, which themſelues haue often fed.
            The Princeſſe, for all the perſwaſion he can vſe, he cannot in loue obtain, yet hath he vſed the good Lady, more cruelly then I would willingly report, the ſtrangeneſſe of her tortures

being ſuch, as fewe but doth greatly pitie. And now as our laſt Poaſtes imparted vnto vs, he hath appointed a time wherein ſhe muſt reſolutely anſwere him to his content, or ende her life in fire. The which crueltie to her vſed, reported by Merchants of Babylon, with the vertues of the Princeſſe, and comming to the Emperors eares, being now in the prime of his yeares, either of pollicie being mightie, to releaſe her, or whether to make her his Ladie and wife, I cannot ſay, but hée hath required her in marriage, pretending great loue vnto her, which the King will not graunt vnto. But in words of great deſpight hath anſwered him, in ſuch manner, as hée greatly diſliking, hath with fire and ſword defied him, who being a Prince of very great might and force, our nobles of Egipt, haue thought good rather to ioyne with fauourable ſhowes of friendſhip, then abide the extremitie of his furie. Loe ſir, quoth hée, thus haue I ſatiſfied your requeſt, which is all I can doo. And for the ſame quoth the Knight, receiue thy libertie, with what other fauour I may do thée.
            Theſe newes was as pleaſing to the Mayden Knight, as if he had bene poſſeſſed of the Crowne, and hauing ſuch aduantage, holding it ſmall pollicie to looſe any time, comforting Cariolus, emmitting the charge of his priſoners vnto his good regard, hée haſteth to his owne ſhip, where, vnto Theophilus King of Theſſaly, hée recounted what hée had heard, deſiring that order might be preſently taken, whereby the enemy might be ſurprized at vnawares, ſo might they finiſh their intents with leſſe danger and more honour, on which they agréeing, they ſummoned their chiefeſt, vnto whome, the Knight recounted what the Egyptian had declared, beſéeching the King whoſe cauſe it was, to ſpeake his minde, then the reſt to giue their aduiſe what they thought was beſt to be done, for accompliſhing their deſires, and planting the King in his owne Countries.
            Theſe queſtions propounded, each particular perill,

with each aduantage, and occaſion which offered good ſucceſſe was throughly debated, when they had each one deliuered their minde, Pheander, whoſe honor was now in the Balance, as one that deſired no worldly poſſeſſions ſo much as the reputation with his miſtreſſe and the King, ſaide; Noble Gentlemen, you haue all like reſolute, braue & hardie men at Armes, ſhewed in your ſpéeches the deſire you haue to do this noble King that ſeruice for which we come, if therfore you wil encline your eares to my opiniō among the reſt, I ſhall acknowledge my ſelfe greatly fauoured by you. The whole company which by curteſie was drawne to his loue, was eaſily wonne to this requeſt, and willed him ſay on, which he did in this maner.
            My Noble Lords, and friends in Armes, touching theſe motions made for our procéedings, it hath bin by the Egyptian reported, whom we do credit, the King is in poſſeſſion of Theſſaly, which Crowne, we know all, he doth diſhonorably vſurpe. The Princeſſe, ſhe, in ſuch extreme, that by his cruell cenſure is not long to liue, vnleſſe againſt her will ſhe grant to loue him, who is loathſome in her eyes. To preuent which, it behoueth vs to ſearch the beſt meane that we can, and for that euery one hath giuen his cenſure, this is my aduiſe, that hauing theſe Nobles in our poſſeſſion, in whome conſiſteth the ſtrength of his Realme, our company being luſtie and ſtrong, we wil raunge their confines, where finding place & opportunitie, we may ſurprize them at vnawares, who being ſubdued, his force ſhall be the more impaired. That done, we will with all conuenient ſpéed paſſe for Theſſaly, where I doubt not but to come before the time limited the Princeſſe for her anſwere, and to reſkew her, deliuering the poſſeſſion of the Crowne, into the Kinges hand, the Knight hauing ſaid, preſently it was confirmed, and each Captain departed to his charge according to directions giuen, entered the confines of Egipt, where they wrought by ſuch pollicie and directions of the Mayden Knight, that they landed in the dead of y• night,

the greateſt part of their Armies, marching in warlike order towards the Citie of Buckelia, where the king kept his chiefe Court, and where their greateſt force was. But before they could recouer the walls, or come to view the ſame for any aduantage, they were deſcried, and the gates ſhut, againſt whom the Citizens made ſuch power as they could for their defence, which vnexſpected of the Knight, cauſed him to ſtaie vntill himſelfe went to knowe their pleaſures and to deliuer his owne intent. And mounting himſelfe, onely accompanied with his Herald and one Trumpet, hée came before the walles, ſommoning them to parley, which was anſwered againe by an other Trumpet, and ſuch of the nobilitie as was within, ſhewed themſelues vnto him, demanding a cauſe of his comming in Armes to diſturbe their dominions, and the ſubiects to their King.
            Nobles of Egypt, anſwered the Mayden Knight, Theophilus
                lawfull King of Theſſaly, whoſe Crowne, your King Donacia, vniuſtly withholdeth, preſerued by heauens power for your ſcourge, and to reuenge the bloud of thoſe innocents ſlaine by your crueltie, is come with fire and ſword to require his right, which if you accept, and will deliuer, hée ſendes you by me mercy, if you deny and do not ſurrender your Crowne of Egypt, with all the regalties, honors, priuiledges and cuſtomes, thereunto belonging, and become his faithful ſubiects and liegemen, you ſhal all periſh with the ſword, and your Countrey flaming with fire, ſhall be ouerthrowne, in ſuch maner, that in time to come, there ſhal nothing be found but the ruines of your gorgious Palaces, and ſtately Cities, this hath he vowed by the honour of his name: therefore chooſe like wary Champions, and let me know your willes, for no detraction may be vſed.
            The Egyptian Pheres, which heard the name of Theophilus, whom they long ſithence ſuppoſed dead, were ſurprized with a ſodaine feare, in ſuch manner as their ſences were depriued, and they r

                  •
               ed like men in extacie, fearing the reuenge of him whom they did all know was by their

King highly wronged, yet ſhewing the Nobilitie of their mindes, ſhaking off feare, they ſayd; Syr Knight, thy vnlooked for meſſage is ſuch, as we know not ſodeinly how to anſwere, neyther will we lyke faynt hearted peaſants, derogate from our Noble aunceſtors, the honour they long mainteined, with cowardiſe to deliuer that which nature and fidelitie vrgeth vs to defend, our liues we eſtéeme as they are, vaine, and euery day ſubiect to caſualties & death, nor do we enioy that ſmall time giuen vs, but onely for our Common-weale, and benefit of our Country, being pillers on whom the ſtate dependeth: you haue daſtardlyke wayted opportunitie to take vs at aduantage, our King not preſent, whoſe right and intereſt we are ſworne to maintaine. Therefore to Theophilus ſay; That as we ſerue our King, and liue by his Grace, we will with our deareſt bloud withſtand the inuaſion of any forraine Prince whatſoeuer. If our king as you alleage, haue offered wrong vnto him, let him reuenge it on him, and ſéeke his amendes where he may get it, for other entertainment let him not looke for here.
            The Mayden Knight, hearing their reſolution, greatly commended their valour, and loyaltie to their ſoueraigne, who ſéeing their truth, pittied them, and wiſhed all men ſo faithfull mindes: yet how well ſo euer he lyked their anſwere, their intents was to be conſidered, who came with more reſolute mindes then to be wonne with faire words, and therefore returned with all haſt to the Camp, where to the king, he briefly deliuered the ſumme of their anſwere, which the king tooke no pleaſure to heare, rather deſiring their ſubmiſſion by curteſie, then the effuſion of bloud; yet not to pitie them in ſuch maner to giue ouer the aduantage he had, wherefore that they might be aſſured of his reſolution which came to conquere, from his vſurping foe, taking his Army which was ledde by the appoynted Generall, hée brought them before the Citie, vnto whom they gaue many ſharp and fierce allarmes, and were valiantly repulſed,

not without great loſſe of either part. Thus continued the aſſault long and dreadfull, till Pheander noting the time of the Princeſſe Phederaes death to draw neare, when either ſhe muſt be reſcued, or dye that extreame death aſſigned, he determined to put all on fortune, to ſée the ende, and not longer to prolong time. And calling thoſe whoſe valour he had moſt aſſurance off, hée made knowne vnto them his intent, requiring their company, wherunto ſmall perſwaſions ſerued, deſirous to be a partner with him in his actions, which were in all things very honorable. The knight aſſured of his friends and followers in this action, gaue directions to all Captaines, at the going downe of the Sunne to be readie furniſhed with their companies, to bid the enemy battell, doing their beſt, before that place where their chiefe force was, in the meane time, he with his accomplices would aſſaile ſome other part which was of leſſe abilitie to defend.
            Thus theſe noble Gentlemen, hauing determined as they ſay, to winne the horſe or loſe the ſaddle, neglected no time, ſo that againſt the appointed houre, each man in his place was readily furniſhed, and moſt valiantly attempted with all warlike Enſignes to enter the Cittie, battering, ſcaling, and each ſeuerall wayes ſearching, that pollicie or valour would permit, to bring the Citie to ruine, and vanquiſh ye enemy, which was moſt nobly defended with great courage and much loſſe of either part. While they were at their hardy fight on either part, it is not to be forgottē, how the Mayden Knight with his aſſociates, ſéeking opportunitie, by chance lighted on the ſide of an old wall, which being ſomewhat decaied, they by induſtry of their hands & painfull toyle, eaſily made the breach ſuch, that they entered at pleaſure, and paſſyng through the ſtréetes which ledde to the aſſaulted gate, moleſted no man vntill they came thither, where entering the ſame, ſlewe the watch and opened the gate, aduancing the Thracian Kings colours on the top therof, crying euer in their way as they paſſed,

               Theſſaly, Theſſaly. This cry amazed the Citizens, and Armed the Thraſians to the hotter attempt, who entered to the reſt, & with ſuch courage bare them, that they had ſoone vanquiſhed the defendants, who to ſaue their liues, had betaken themſelues to their Churches, as places of Sanctuary, from whence they ſent their wiues and Infants all diſrobed, to ſearch the King, and in their names to require his pardon, ſuch diligence made the modeſt matrones, that they were brought by Pheander to the King, where proſtrating themſelues at his féete, their face bedeawed with teares, they humbly beſought him to take compaſſion on them, their huſbands and children, that as he was a Conquerer, ſo with fauour to vſe the glory of his victory, as the poore ſubiects might not haue cauſe to complaine them of his crueltie, who had done nothing blame worthie, but as true ſubiects to their ſoueraigne the King, whoſe hart was moued with pittie at their ſute, gently tooke them vp, meaſuring their calamitie by his owne miſfortunes, and bethought him of their fidelitie, yet pretending a ſhow of vnkindneſſe, for refuſing his mercy proffered them by his noble Generall, he would not be entreated ſodeinly to grant them life, which the Noble Pheander noted, and like himſelfe, waying their faith to their Prince, and weale of their Countrey, which with their liues they had ſought to maintaine, he was content to remit their fault, and not onely to pardon their liues, but reſtore them to all former liberties, and places of honour, without any diſparagement to their royaltie, ſo that they would acknowledge him their ſoueraigne, and be as faithfull to him and his, as they had ſhewed themſelues to that vſurper his enemy. This choyſe at firſt ſéemed hard, yet of two euils the leaſt is to be choſen, as theſe Nobles of Egypt, who ſéeing their liues, wiues, children, and what they poſſeſt, to be in the hands of ſtrangers, whom they could not withſtand, making a vertue of neceſſitie, were the rather wonne to yéeld themſelues vnto the Kings pleaſure, at the interceſſion of their wiues, whoſe

teares ſhead in abundance, moued them to ruth, in ſuch wiſe, that ſubiecting on theſe conditions to his Exellence, they proclaimed him king of Theſſaly and Egypt, ſwearing fayaltie vnto him, and deliuering hoſtages for their loyaltie. This done, the king with generall conſent Crowned, the Commons gan conceiue an eſpeciall hope of his honorable loue to them, whoſe kindneſſe was ſuch, that hauing the Citie and whole kingdome at his pleaſure, would not ſuffer his ſouldiers to imbeaſell or purloyne in any ſort, but rather made choiſe to reward the Mercenary men out of his owne treaſury, which honourable beginning, gained their eſpecial lyking: when order was taken for the gouernment of the ſtate, Pheander who was mindfull of the Princeſſe Phedera, haſted the King on for Theſſaly, often putting him in mind, what daungers the good Lady was likely to abide, if ſhe conſented not to the King, who was more cruell then curteous, wherefore taking their pledges, he left the noble Cariolus his Vizegerent, to take the gouernment vpon him in his abſence, and with the next fauourable wind, they ſet ſaile for Theſſaly, where to their good ſucceſſe wée leaue them, to tell you more of Muſtapha, the Heathen Prince, who was in the Princeſſe Nutania her cuſtodie.
            The mightie Emperour of Constantinople, vnderſtanding the ill ſucceſſe of his ſonne, with the great ſlaughter of his men, was moued at the firſt to ſuch chollor, that he had determined for euer to abandone his ſonne, and neuer to haue knowne or regarded him, but being perſwaded by his nobilitie which tenderly loued the prince, he was at length by their motions, wonne to conceiue, how vnſtable fortunes chances are, and how victories ſometimes happen as well to the coward as the valiant, not forgetting to vrge vnto him, how diſhonourable it were for a Prince, to leaue the meaneſt ſubiect he had at ſuch an exigent, that ſhould aduenture his life in his ſeruice, much more was his Maieſtie bound by natures lawes to reléeue his ſonne, and not ſuffer him as one forſaken, to remaine in the handes of his enemies,

vpon which motion of his Baſhawes, the King cauſed two Gallies to be rigged and furniſhed, appointing of his chiefeſt Nobles too, for that voyage to Thrace, as wel to aduertiſe him of his ſonnes welfare which he fauoured, as alſo to agrée vpon the ſumme of his ranſom, all things furniſhed for the voyage, the Baſhawes hauing taken leaue of the Emperor and the reſt of their friends, fauoured with a happy gale, they ſhortly arriued in Thrace, of whoſe arriual, the king by his meſſengers was aduertiſed, who being of nature honourable and curteous in behauiour, cauſed a ſumptious traine of Courtiers, with all the honorable maner they could, to receiue them at their Port of landing, taking lyke order in all lodgings and places of repaſt, his Officers at his charge to attend them, which in ſuch exquiſit manner was performed, as the Baſhawes with their retinue, admyred their entertainment. Thus by eaſie iournies came they to the court, where the king with the princeſſe, gaue them many welcomes, enquiring kindly after the good health of the renowmed Emperour their maiſter, whome hée maligned no whit at all, how hardly ſo euer he had meaſured his friendſhip with him, when the King and theſe Nobles had ſpent ſome time in diſcourſing, they enquired of the welfare of their Prince Muſtaffa, whome the King cauſed to be ſought and brought to their preſence, before whome they bowed themſelues in all humbleneſſe, as to the ſonne of their ſoueraigne, whom he againe with all kindneſſe imbraſed, paſſyng the time with much pleaſure, ioying in the welfare of his friendes. The King dooing them all the honour that could bee deuiſed, paſſing the time with ſuche recreation and gentle ſportes as the Countrey affoorded, at length, a ſumme of money for the Princeſſe raunſome was agreed vpon to their content, for that it was reaſonable, and the cōditions honorable, which obteined their vittailes by the king was reléeued, & all neceſſaries at his charge purueyed, in ſuch maner, and with ſo much bounty, as they had great cauſe to report honorably of

the kyng. Long had they not tarried, but a winde pleaſant and fauourable, preſents it ſelfe, which good time, they neglected not, but taking leaue of the king, their prince, & princeſſe Nutania, who accompanied them onwards to their gallies, thrée whole daies iournies, they leaue them to the care of their iourny, who being imbarqued, in ſhort time arriued at Conſtantinople, where how welcom they were to the Emperour & his Nobles, I omit, to let you vnderſtand of y• honorable reports made of their entertainment in Thrace, and the welfare of the prince, whoſe company, there were fewe but deſired. The ſtrangenes of this report made of Philarcus, was excéeding admirable in the Emperors eares, who wondered not a little, that a king whome he had ſo much wronged, ſhould vſe ſuch kindnes to his ſon, and curteſie to his meſſengers, extolling highly the honourable condition of the king, and much lamenting his owne follyes, ſo raſhly without any occaſion offered, to iniury him ſo farre as to ſpoyle his Countrey, and to robbe him perforce of his onely child, his ſole delight & comfort. To recompence all which, and to kéep his friendſhip, he preſently elected other nobles for Thrace, to be employd, which with the princeſſe ranſom, and many rich preſents to the king and his daughter were diſpatched, with Letters of loue, and deſire of amitie, all which, comming to the Thraſian king, were ſo heartily accepted as they could wiſh, and in preſence of the nobles, and ſtates of both Realmes, was the peace concluded, and a band of euerlaſting friendſhip promiſed, to all their ioyes. Thus with great delight at the earneſt interceſſion of the king, ſpent thoſe Turkiſh nobles ſometime in Thrace, till their prefixed time ganne drawe to ende, when receiuing their Prince with great rewardes, and many thankes for their paines they put to Sea, and were not long before they recouered theyr famous Cittie of Conſtantinople, where they were moſt royally welcommed, but eſpecially the Prince, for whoſe ſafetie many paſtymes was ordeined, with Iuſtings, Turneyes, Barriers, and other

pleaſing delights, wherein the Prince honorably bare him ſelfe, to the great ioy of his father, and pleaſure of the whole ſtate, who gloried greatly in him, which was likely to proue a moſt honorable Prince; and their enſuing comfort. But while I digreſſe, let it be conſidered, that y• 
               Mayden Knight, who thirſted to ſée the ende of his deſires, ſlept no time, but made all poſſible meanes he could, as winde and weather would giue leaue, vntil he arriued in Theſſaly, which he recouered in ſo good time as he could wiſh, and taking that opportunitie which was offered, he landed his companies, and neare to the ſea ſide encamped his power, vntill he might be aduertiſed of what power the King was, and where hée remained, for the atteining of which, many eſpialls was ſent out ſundry wayes, and many Ambuſcadoes layd, to intercept ſuch as trauelled the country: but their landing being diſcryed, euery one in the haſte they could make, hyed them to their cities and places of defence, where they with their ſtore of prouiſion which they brought, were receiued. The King, who ſecurely paſſed his time, taking care for nothing, and ioying wholly in the hopes he conceiued of his Ladies graunt, being aduertiſed of the arriuall of a forrein power, ouercome with ſorrow at that inſtant, as one that neuer taſted aduerſitie, was ſurprized with ſuch ſodain heauines, as no words, no perſwaſions, nor any comfort, might mittigate his ſorrow, what paines ſoeuer his Nobles tooke to pacifie him, his guiltie conſcience preſaging ſome hard fortune to be at hand: the Nobilitie which had more regard to his welfare and his countrey then he could on the ſodain imagine, after they had cauſed their Rampyers to be ſhut, and their Fortreſſes to be made, doubting the worſt, deſirous to be reſolued what the enemy was, that thus daringly durſt boord him in his own country, they cauſed the Lord Mama Bacha, ſomtime one of the chiefeſt in Theſſaly, a wiſe and well gouerned Gentleman, to be ſent vnto them, to know whence they were, and their pretence, which againſt their willes, vnacquainting them with their pretence, had

entered their confines. The Noble man to whoſe charge this was committed, though he had ſmall care of any matter, liuing diſhonoured in his owne Country, where, in his Kings raigne he was the onely honoured, and amongſt his Nobles in moſt account of him, had his wits ſundry wayes imployd, and on diuerſe matters, yet amongſt all imaginations, the thought of his owne ſoueraigne was leaſt, the report of his death being ſo certain, but what ſo euer he could imagine was vncertaine, wherefore as deſirous to be reſolued of his doubts, as the King and Nobles to be thereof certified, onely accompanied with an other of the diſgraced Nobilitie, they hyed them towards the Campe, and was by the Ambuſcadoes ſoone ſurprized and brought to the Pauilion of the Generall, who ſaluting them with kind countenance, demaunded whence they were, and what occaſions led them in ſuch ſuſpitious manner towards their Campe. The Nobles which had ſmall care which ende went foreward, after they had well aduiſed themſelues, ſaid; (ſir,) if we giue not thoſe tytles your honour deſerue, pardon vs which offend not of preſumption therein, but of ignorunce: that we come as ſpyalls to view thy force, and to diſcouer them, therein you deceiue your ſelfe, but come as meſſengers from our King, to know thy pretence, and what thou meaneſt landing thy Armies without his lycence, which is contrary to lawe of Armes? If thou come in peace and not as as enimy, reſolue vs this, & thou honoreſt vs? The prince taking their wordes at aduantage, where they ſayd they came from their King, with a counterfeyt ſhewe of great diſlike, ſayd; Traytors how dare you to my face vſe thoſe colours of ſimplicitie, when you auer you come from your King, which I know is altogither vntrue? wherefore that you ſhall warne the reſt how they delude me, you ſhal haue the reward of traytors, and calling for the prouoſt Marſhall, commanded him to cut off their heads. The Nobles, thinking he had bene paſt ieaſt, ſéeing their executioner ſo ready, humbly beſought him to credit what they had ſayd,

which was true, and pardon their liues, for that lawe of Armes protecteth the meſſenger of the Prince, from whom they come, therefore it would redowne to his great diſhonour, to violate the hoſtilitie of all Princes. While they were thus at their ſhrift, it chanced Theophilus their lawful King, to enter the Pauilion of his General, whoſe preſence much appalled the Theſſalian nobles, who ſtanding as men paſt themſelues, had no thought but in beholding him, which ſo much reſembled their ſuppoſed dead king, the long noting of whom, cauſed them to renue their ſorrows, and with remembrance of the times they had paſt, to ſhead teares. The King imagining what they thought, knowing them well, put them from their ſtudious thoughts thus.
            Men of Theſſaly, what meaneth your heauineſſe? think you hereby to delude this noble Gentleman, or by your fainings, to procure your fauour, if either one or other of theſe cauſes, you deceiue your ſelues, and incurre you more trouble? Wherfore to auoyd the perils incident vnto you, if you be right Theſſalians, and tender the walfare of your Princeſſe, in whoſe reſcue we come, briefly declare vnto vs, in what eſtate ſhe abideth, and where the vſurping king hath his reſidence? Mama Bacha, hearing that pleaſing tongue, wherwith he was acquainted, aſſured himſelfe that it was their king, and without further ſtay, humbly kiſſyng his Maieſties féete, his face bedeawed with teares, and his tongue foltering in his mouth, as one with ſodaine ioy ouercome, he ſaith; My gratious ſoueraigne, how glad am I that enioy breath, to behold your Maieſtie aliue, whom all the world reputeth for dead, the heauy tydings of which, with your ill ſucceſſe, moued the hearts of your louing ſubiects to ſuch extreame heauineſſe, as nothing might comfort, that paſt comfort, and al hope of beholding your princely face, we reckoned you amongſt the dead. In the extreme of this ſorrow, as all euils commonly fall in one, when euery heart and eye was deploring the loſſe of ſo gratious a Prince, then beganne our further griefes through the

oppreſſion of this vſurping tyrant, whoſe crueltie to thy ſubiects hath bene ſuch, as gréeueth me to recount. Thy ſiſter he deteineth in priſon, from whence he hath vowed ſhe ſhall neuer be freed, vntil with conſent ſhe take him for her king, or by gainſaying his demaundes, receiue that death which he hath doomed her vnto, whoſe wronges we poore men how much ſo euer we pittie, yet can we remedy nothing, our abilitie being litle, and our reputation leſſe, Amongſt theſe cruel Egyptians who hath robbed vs of what we poſſeſt, not ſuffering vs to enioy our auncient patrimony, nor what they might any way diſpoile vs of: to reuenge of which, we hope in thée and thy power, who wilt maintaine and defende thy owne lawfull right, rather offering thy life amongſt vs that honour and loue thée as our liues, then leaue vs any more. To the accompliſhing of which, my ſelfe, with all thy owne Countrey borne ſubiectes that wée can procure vnto vs, will lende what ayd our weake force will ſtretch vnto, and thereof aſſure your Maieſtie.
            The King hearing the lamentable report of the Lord Mama Bacha, could not forbeare to ſhewe the heauineſſe of his hearts ſorrow, by his outward motions, yet to hide it as he might, imbracing them both, hée framed a feined ioy to ſée them, how ſo euer his heart was ouerburthened with grief. Whē they had paſſed ſome time in parley about their affaires, and that ſome offers were made by theſe Nobles, of their ayde and aſſiſtance, a generall Councell was called, where, by conſent of ſuch as had gouernment, vnderſtanding the power of Donatio the vſurper, was no more but ſuch as guarded his holdes, it was determined, after the army had refreſhed themſelues two or thrée daies, to martch forewarde to the Cittie, there to beleager the King, and cut off from them all ſupply of prouiſion for victualles, whereof they had ſmall ſtore.
            In the meane time, the Lordes of Theſſaly, to giue notiſe to all their friends, (with all ſpéede) as they tendered their

owne liberties, to repaire with ſuch power as they could make vnto the Campe. This deuiſe was no ſooner determined on, but the Noble Mama Bacha, without returning to the King, ſpared not his paines and all others which hée could command or entreate, proclaiming in euery place as they paſſed, Theophilus their lawful king, ſtraightly charging all naturall ſubiects of Theſſaly, to make repaire vnto the Campe. Theſe tydings at firſt were hardly beléeued, yet ſuch was the rumour of a forreine power landed, that all which could beare Armes repaired to the King, whome they founde at the aſſault of the Cittie where the vſurper kept, ſuch was the multitudes of people, which from all countries in his Regions came vnto him, that in ſhort time he had power ſufficient to ouerrunne a kingdome. The vſurper Donatio, who had leaſt thought euer to heare or ſée the Theſſalian King, when the report of his being in the Campe, was brought vnto him, his courage quailed, and his hope of enioying the Crowne, was quite extinguiſhed, ſo that diſpairing, he became lyke a man lunatike, that nothing (whatſoeuer) might moue him to any mirth or content, ſo that giuing ouer all, he cared not what became of himſelfe or his, y
                  •
               t was he carefully counſelled by his Nobles, who regarded both his honour and their owne ſafetie: but whatſoeuer they might counſell or determine, was ill imployd, at his hands was nothing to be had, wherefore, after they ſaw his ſmall care, and that he was not to be aduiſed, they determined, either in field with vnappoynted battell to try their fortunes, or by ſome ſuch compoſition as might be for their Courtries ſafetie and their reputation, to giue ouer their tytle pretended to the Crowne of Theſſaly. Before that any thing was of them reſolued, the Mayden Knight, which had his minde on his Lady, as well as of other affaires, could not reſt in content, vntill he had finiſhed, and either gained what they came for, or ſéene the euent of fortune. Wherefore to auoyd further delaies, hée ſummoned the Citie to parley, wherein he required their

anſwere, whether they would receiue their lawfull King or no, if yea, they ſhould ſuffer him in peace to enter, or otherwiſe vpon their anſwere, to abide the hazard incident to Armes, which he proteſted ſhould be voyd of all fauour, if he preuailed, and they refuſed this offer of his. Theſe ſummons, cauſed the Nobilitie to looke with better aduiſe into their eſtates, and with conſideration to wey each particuler perill, which they found to be very many, and daungerous, eſpecially ſéeing the multitude, who were naturall ſubiects, and did rather affect their owne King, how ſo euer they profeſſed in outward appearance, then the vſurper, which made them the more earneſt with their King, vnto whom they declared the offers made by the Maiden Knight, with y• doubts they had of his ſucceſſe, who were nothing in number to the Kings power, which daily increaſed, and contrary, his decreaſed: wherfore they aduiſed him to yéeld vnto ſuch Articles of honour as they would require, which ſhould be both for his honour, and ſafetie of him and his. The vſurper hearing theſe perſwaſions from them, wheron his chéefeſt hope conſiſted, forgetting all former friendſhip and loue to any of them, with moſt odious words reuiled them, calling them traytors, daſtards, and vpbraiding them with cowardiſe, which were neuer founde but euer forward in all his actions, onely this excepted, wherin was no hope. Theſe ſpéeches moued his Nobles to ſuch furie, that departing from him in diſcontent, they reſolued for their owne ſafetie, to ſéek what means they could, and not by delaies to incurre his diſpleaſure whoſe friendſhip they were by all meanes they could vſe, to intreat. Wherfore in name of all the reſt, the Lord Philiago, principall Treaſuror vnto the King, by whoſe direction the reſt would be gouerned, ſent for the Princeſſe (Phedera) from priſon, whom he vſed with honorable ſpéeches, comforting her with hope of her kingly brother, who liued, and was in perſon come with a ſtrong power, to deliuer her from that captiuitie which ſo long ſhe endured, humbly beſéeching her grace, to

become a fauourable ſoliciter to his Highneſſe, for them, who were to be commaunded by their ſoueraigne, whoſe ſubiects they were, proteſting that neither for enuy to him or his, they vndertooke the action, but at commaundment, and to auoyde the ignomious tytle of cowardize, which all of honorable birth or mind, ought to deteſt. The good Princeſſe which could not tell, whether ſhe might giue credit to his words or no, anſwered him thus.
            My Lord Philiago, vnder the gréeneſt graſſe lurketh the moſt perillous poyſon, and experience hath taught me, in my durance, the knowledge of friends, theſe ſodeine offers of loue to my brother, whom you all know, is long ſithence dead, cauſeth me the more to dread, I am going to him, and that your proffered friendſhip is but to that end to bereaue mée of that which long ſince I wiſhed to leaue, if it bée ſo, good my Lorde, hyde not the truth thereof from mée, for therein ſhall you ſhewe your charitable minde to a diſtreſſed Captiue.
            Farre be it from my thought, Noble Ladie, quoth Philiago, that I ſhould any way delude you, or moue you to credit any thing other then truth, whom I haue my greateſt hope of good, to aſſure you of which, ſo pleaſeth your Exellence, I will my ſelfe bring you to his Maieſties preſence. When the Princeſſe heard him make theſe proffers of fauours, and perceiued by his ieſture he did not counterfeyt, ouercome with ioy, ſhe was in a traunce, from which, reuiued by the carefull induſtry of the Lady Vrania, wife to the Lord Philiago, ſhée gaue the Noble man great thanks for his tydings, aſſuring him on her word, that ſhe would ſo recompence that good, as hée nor his, ſhould haue any cauſe to complaine of her vngratefulneſſe. Vrging him with her curteous ſpéech, to detract no time but to bring her to the Campe where the King was, which he willingly yéelded vnto, and cauſing a ſtately Charyot to be ordeined, and richly apparrelling the Princeſſe as befitteth her, accompanied with his Ladie and two daughters of rare

bewtie, himſelfe wayting on her diſrobed, iſſued out of the gates, and in ſhort time came neare the Campe, and were by the Sentronelles diſcouered, and brought to the Kings preſence, who ſéeing the Princeſſe, whome hée had great doubt the tyrant would haue murthered, ſo ſodaine a ioy ſurprized him, as he might not ſpeake, yet ouercomming his paſſion, ioyning his face with hers, after many kinde imbraſings, he ſaith; Phedera, how haue the heauens bleſſed me, in giuing me life to behold thée, more deare vnto me then a million of liues, whom ſithence I poſſeſſe, as the onely ioy I conceiued hope of in this world, I account my happines more, then to be poſſeſſed of the worlds reuenew. But tell me Phedera, what are theſe that accompany thée, ſtrangers to me they are, how frendly ſoeuer they haue vſed thée?
            Moſt gracious ſoueraign, for theſe noble perſons, I am to intreate, hauing paſſed my word, to be their ſafe conduct frō any violence ſhould be offred them, therefore good my Lord, receiue into your fauour, the Lord Philiago, Treaſurer to the vſurper, his Ladie and daughters, ſuch as are by them protected, ſo ſhalt thou honor me the more, by mainteining my word, which relying on your princely nature, I haue paſt. The Mayden Knight, willing to hold her honor in regard, ſayd; Madame, how his Maieſtie on the ſodaine may be wonne to fauour your ſute, I cannot ſay, hauing had ſuch great cauſe to reuenge him on their crueltie, but for his life, let him thanke your grace, if he enioy it. The King, whoſe heart pittie moued to tender the ſute of the princeſſe, comming towards the noble Philiago and his Lady, with great curteſie tooke them from the earth wheron they knéeled, accepting them to his maieſtie, vſing them with ſuch honor & curteſie, that they admired him. After he had reuiued with his kinde confections theſe ſorrowing ſuters, hée ſaid; Philiago, as I haue pardoned thy life, ſo faile not to tell me, thy Kings determination, whether he will yéeld, or in battell try the euent of our fortunes?
            
               Gratious ſoueraign, quoth Philiago, that he determines to ſéeke your grace, is more then I can ſay, for ſuch deſperate humors aſſaileth him, that he is not himſelfe, & friends faileth him, from the Noble to the peaſant, whoſe wiſdoms haue with graue aduiſe conſidered, what wrongs hath bin offered your grace, and hath vpon your Princely motions of mercy, ſolicited him to pittie them, and yéeld vnto your grace, which when he could not be perſwaded vnto, we all left him, and I in name of all the Nobilitie, humbly beſéech your highneſſe of mercy, who onely attendeth but my returne, at which time on your gratious word, they will deliuer the Citie.
            My Lord quoth the King, what cauſe ſo euer I haue in the moſt extréemeſt maner to reuenge me on you all, yea to the very childe that ſucketh, that I omit. And that thou and they all ſhall know I delight not in bloud, nor wiſh I the life of my mortalleſt fo
                  •
               , returne vnto them, and from mée ſay, that if in ſubmiſſiue wiſe, they iſſue their gates, and at my féete craue mercy, bring with them their vſurping king, I will accept them, ſo that thou and they ſhal ſweare your dutifull alleageance to me and mine, ſhall be hereafter mainteined in ſuch maner as becommeth faithfull ſubiects to their Prince, I will admit them to my grace, and will be vnto them a louing and gratious ſoueraigne. Philiago, which had that he moſt deſired, vttering with many déepe ſighes, the ioy his hart conceiued for his good ſucceſſe, after many humble and heartie praiers for the kings long life in all happines to be mainteined, he beſought his grace to giue him leaue with his happy tydings, to make glad the hearts of thoſe ſorowfull Nobles which exſpected his returne, which the king granted, deteining his wife & daughters to attend his ſiſter, whoſe ioyes excéeded the extremes of her miſery, enioying her Noble brother, which ſhe was out of all hope euer to behold againe. To their recreation we leaue them, and paſſe on with the Lord Philiago, who made no ſtaie vntill he came to the gates, where diuerſe of

his friends exſpected his comming. No ſooner entered hée the Cittie, but ſommoning the Nobles and Gonernors of the Citte togither, he deliuered vnto them, what fauour he had receiued of the King, and how willing he was to ſhew lyke clemencie vnto them all, vpon thoſe conditions ſpecified, whereunto he perſwaded them to yéeld, not omitting any thing to make them mindfull of the litle hope they had of the vſurpers ſucceſſe, for which they had no reaſon to encline vnto him, who had ſo ſmall regard of them, but rather let him endure the reward of his owne follies, then that ſo many ſhould periſh for one mans wronges. Reſolued thus, they haſtened vnto the Cou
                  •
               t, at whoſe ſodaine entering, the King was greatly appalled, conſidering in what diſcontent they parted with him, yet ſhewing a countenance voyd of all feare, he required the cauſe of their comming, whome they ſoone reſolued, letting him know each particuler of their euent, perſwading him to patience, for what they had determined ſhould be accompliſhed. The King hearing his owne doome of miſery pronounced, albeit it moued him to great impatience, yet reſtraining chollor, he with his ſmooth ſpéech, beſought them of reſpite for his anſwere till the next morning, which they willingly conſented vnto. And ſo leauing him, they departed each one to his ſeuerall mantion. But he in whoſe heart reuenge harboured, hauing his minde wholly bent on their ruine, after he had conferred with ſuch as were as full of miſchiefe, as himſelfe of crueltie, and was by them aduertiſed, what power they were off, he cauſed them ſecretly in the night Armed, to aſſemble at the Court, where in very couert manner they remained, vntill the time came that the Nobles ſhould come to receiue their anſwer, who void of all ſuſpect of euill, entred the Pallace, deſirous to know his pleaſure, touching the matter th

Nobles, whome he accuſed of treaſon and vniuſt dealing, againſt him and the ſtate of his countrey, that flying from him which was their lawfull ſoueraigne, ſought to ſupplant him, to Crowne another. But Traytors quoth hée, you ſhall reape ſuch reward as your treachery deſerueth, and therewithall giuing the watch-word, his confederates which for the purpoſe was ambuſhed, iſſued vppon them, and ſodeinly ſurprized as many as they could come by, the the reſt that fled, entring the Citie, proclaimed the lawfull king, offering in his name frée pardon of life and goods, to as many as folowed them. At which offer of grace, the commons, wearied with the oppreſſion of the vſurper, in multitudes aſſembled themſelues, and guided by Philiago, they fiercely aſſailed the king in his Court, fleying as many as they could reach vnto, and reſkued their fellowe Nobles, whoſe death by the Tyrant was determined, had not the valour and policie of this noble Philiago preuailed. In this exployt, many of the company of the vſurper was ſlain, him ſelfe with ſuch as eſcaped, betooke them to the mountaines, where they encamped themſelues, exſpecting aide of thoſe he had preferred. But they more regarding their owne weale then his honor, and ſéeing no comfort or hope of recouery, ſubmitted themſelues vnto the kings mercy, and was of him receiued. This canueſado paſſed, the commons with generall voyce elected Theophilus for their Kyng, Philiago, poaſted him with all ſpéede to the Campe, and to the king deliuered the trecherous pretence of the vſurper, with the euent of all his and their actions, and in the name of the whole ſtate beſought him to receiue the Crown, and the faithfull loue of all the commons. Theophilus hearing the miſchéeuous pretence of this vſurper, pittying his ſubiects that had ſo long bene gouerned by a prince ſo ill conditioned, at the earneſt interceſſion of the noble Philiago, guarded with a troupe of his truſtieſt men at Armes, marched he to the Citie, at the entery rf which, the whole Nobilitie, bare legged and bare footed, receiued him, and to his

highneſſe deliuered the keyes of their ports, with preſents of rich price, marching before him to the Pallace, crying with a generall voyce Theophilus, Theophilus. The king noting his ſubiects loues, with heartie thankes requited them all, exhorting them to obedience and loyaltie, which if they faithfully followed, he would be a mercifull prince vnto them. Theophilus, in poſſeſſion of his Crowne, willyng his friendes ſhould participate with him, diſpatched a meſſenger for the Mayden Knight, the Princeſſe, and her attendants, who all as their dutie, obediently fulfilled his commaundement, the Maiden Knight excepted; who carefull of his charge, and looking into the practiſes and deuiſes of the vſurper, beſought his grace to pardon his not comming to Court for a time, vntill hée had ſeene the euent of his affaires, and ſending for ſuch guides as hée was enformed to be well acquainted in theſe deſartes, hée put himſelfe in ſearch for the vſurper, and his ſcattered crew, whome in ſhort time hée founde, to the number of one thouſand, on horſe and foote, which hée no ſooner eſpied, but chearing his companies, which were not aboue fortie, not minding to giue them dayes, he brauely aſſayled them, and ſo valiantly behaued himſelfe in that conflict, that after two whole houres ſpent in hardy feates of Chiualry, there was fewe of the companies liuing. The king hée ſurprized as hée was flying, with whome hée returned to the Cittie, and to the king Theophilus deliuered him, who kindly accepting his Preſent, returning the knight many thanks for his paines. This brunt paſt, and all things by the valour and good induſtry of the Mayden Knight, brought to quiet ende, the king vnwillyng to detaine his ſubiectes from their owne homes, recompencing euey man for his ſeruice, diſlodged the camp. A worlde of wonder it were, to recount what general ioy was throughout the land for the return of their king, & his good ſucces, for which great triumphs were ordeined, with Iuſts, Barriers & Tilt, wherein the nobles of ye country in

great brauery behaued themſelues, but the beſt and chiefeſt honor in each ſeuerall action, was giuen the Mayden Knight, who lyke himſelfe ſo behaued himſelfe, as there was no talke, throughout Court and Countrey, but tended to the generall commendations of this noble Prince. Thus as all things hath end, ſo ended theſe tryumphes, and the King in peace enioyed his kingdome, which through the Thracian Kings aſſiſtance, and the valour of this honored knight, he obteined. Al things quieted, the Mayden Knight, after he had a ſmall time repoſed himſelfe from his trauels, humbly beſought his highneſſe, to ſuffer him with his companies to depart, which fauour, he could not by any intreatie obtaine. Wherefore to ſatiſfie the King with his owne longer ſtaie, he diſmiſſed his Army, whom the King ſo royally rewarded, as no man had cauſe to complain of his time ſpent, but euery one to ſpeake of his honor and bountie. The conduct of whome, after hee had with great care puruaide them victualls, with all things neceſſary, he committed to Vrelia, a noble man of Thrace, by whom the knight aduertiſed the king of his ſtaie, which was chiefly for the Lorde Cariolus, whom they left Vizeroy in Egipt, recommending alſo his ſeruice vnto the Lady Nutania, he preſented by this noble Vrelia, the vſurper vnto her, as her priſoner, (and his conqueſt). Thus all things carefully puruaide, the winde blowing a fauourable gale, they imbarqued themſelues, and ſayling with a winde as they could wiſh, they ſhortly arriued in ſafetie at their deſired Port, where their welcom was ſuch of the king, as they might ioy to receiue it, where friend with friend, ioyed for their returne, onely the Princeſſe endured the greateſt penance, miſſing the returne of her knight, who could not be perſwaded of his welfare, wanting his preſence, yet accepted ſhe the vſurper his priſoner, and through the great proteſtations of the Lord Vrelia, had hope to ſée him againe, whoſe heart enioyed ſmall content, wanting his company.
            Here Gentiles we leaue the noble Pheander, in company

of the Theſſalian King, ſpending his time in ſmall content, wanting the ſight of his deſired Lady, and his Lady with teares bewailing him, whom ſhe more deſired then the worlds poſſeſſions, to ſhew you what happened the auncient Barnardine, who as you haue heard before, left the Numedian Court, with all his poſſeſſions, Pilgrimelyke iourneying towards Delphos, there of the Oracle to be aduertiſed of his king and the princes life or death, and comming to the ſacred Chappell of Apollo, after his Oriſons done and his offrings made, before the ſhrine of Appollo, the pittifull god moued at his interceſſion, and conſidering the faithfull loue to his prince and country, which is pleaſing both to gods and men, after he had with teares bewailed his prince, was thus anſwered.

               Barnardine, whoſe heart was lightened with this comfortable voyce, looking about him, eſpied a paper, which taking vp, he read in this maner:

               ſe lines, muſing at the darkneſſe of the ſame, which he conſtrued many wayes, yet had no certaintie, wherefore reſoluing on the mercifull fauour of the God, which had ſo pittifully heard his prayer, he paſſed on his iourney in ſearch for thoſe princes which hée hoped was liuing, whom to his trauaile we leaue, to returne vnto the Princeſſe Phedera, who hauing the company of the Mayden Knight, had ſundry motions of deſire to enioy his Loue, euermore applauding his perſon, curteſie and valoure, which ſo farre excéeded all mens in her iudgement, that ſhée honoured him for the Paragon of the world, holding her for the moſt happieſt Lady on the earth, which ſhould enioy his loue, wiſhing that ſhe were worthy of his loue, and framyng her ſelfe by all meanes that modeſtie would permit, to gaine it. But hée whoſe heart was fixed on his Lady, had no motion of any other, onely wiſhed to bee with her whome hee ſo much honoured, whoſe preſence, he more deſired, then all the riches the worlde could offoord. Tormented with theſe reſtleſſe paſſions, which was of the King and Courtiers noted, eſpecially of the Lady Phedera, many imagined the cauſe, yet none ſo good a phiſition to finde the truth, or cauſe thereof; as continuall care weakeneth the bodie and cauſeth many extreames, ſo Pheander, féeling in himſelfe a weakeneſſe of nature, and looking for ſome diſeaſe through his melancholy to enſue, finding the king at conuenient time, he humbly beſought him of fauour to depart, alleaging that the

aire, and contagiouſneſſe of thoſe Confines, was nothing agréeing with his body, and that his longer ſtaie, might be by his confuſion.
            The king which loued him as his owne ſoule, and tendered his welfare more▪ then the wealth of his kingdome, whom he had found ſo kinde and forward, aduenturing his life for his good in many broyles, though loth to leaue him in whome ſo much he delighted, yet noting his melancholike humours, which had much altered his complexion, imagined it was no excuſe, and therefore the rather condeſcended to his requeſt, appoynting a time as he deſired, when if God ſent winde and weather, to be readie with their ſhipping, to conduct him to Egypt, whither the king promiſed with his ſiſter and nobles to accompany him, for which iourney, a ſtrict commaund was giuen to all Officers to ſée each thing neceſſary puruayde, which with ſuch diligence was performed, as in ſhort time all things was as they could wiſh or deſire furniſhed, onely attending a faire winde to ſet ſayle, which they ſtayed not long for. But a gale fitting their purpoſe, the kyng with his ſiſter, the Mayden Knight, and their train, embarqued themſelues for Egipt, where by the good furtherance of him that commaundeth all, they ſhortly arriued in ſafetie, whoſe comming, being knowne vnto the Vizeroy Cariolus, with ſuch prouiſion as they could make on the ſuddaine, repaired vnto the place of landing, where the king ioyfull to ſée the good recouery of Cariolus, in moſt kinde maner imbraced him. And ſo generall welcomes being giuen on all ſides by the Nobles, they paſſe on towards the Pallace of the king, who with a generall loue of his Commons, was to his great delight welcommed, with ſuch ſhewes of ioy as on the ſodaine they could prepare.
            Thus after ſome time ſpent in banquetting and other paſtimes for their welcomes, to beguile the time the better, the Mayden Knight ſtanding on thornes, vntill he might

behold the ſwéete content of his liues comfort, finding Cariolus in place where they might diſcuſſe at large theyr mindes. The knight not forgetting his promiſe made to Cariolus in his own country, and willing to make amends for the wrong he had there, thus ſaid:
            My Lord, what I haue to impart vnto you as one that wiſheth your good, is ſuch, as becommeth a friend, vowed to do your Lordſhip what ſeruice my abilitie can ſtretch vnto, onely I beſéech you, promiſe on your honor to conceale what I ſhall diſcouer.
            
               Cariolus, who both honored and loued the knight, muſing to what theſe ſpéeches tended, relying on the fidelitie of him whome he neuer had heard or ſéene to commit any diſhonorable action, gaue him his word and honor, to be as ſecret in all things as he could deſire, which the knight accepting, thus ſaid:
            My Lord, firſt I humbly beſéech your fauourable loue, to be continued, and pardon my great offence committed againſt you, in Numedia, where not being my ſelfe, I committed a moſt hainous offence and diſhonorable, for which I am willing to make ſuch ſatiſfaction, as you can require.
            
               Cariolus, hearing the knight vſe theſe ſpéeches of ſubmiſſion, noting them well, and bethinking himſelfe what had fortuned, being in Numedia, could not call to minde any vnkindneſſe offered him by any inferiour perſon, neither did he well remember the princes diſcurteſie, yet leauing nothing vnſought, calling his wittes togither, bethought him of the prince, whom they forbeare to anſweare, vntill he had with earneſtneſſe noted the phiſnomy of the knight, whoſe face with long ſickneſſe, wherewith he was at that time poſſeſt, was quite altered from the forme it now had, which made him more to admire. But calling to mind the reſemblance of the aged king, he conceiued by ſome ſignes of his fauour, that it was doubtleſſe the prince, yet doubtfull he was, for that being ſo nobly borne, he came to the Numedian Court, with no better countenance then a Merchant.

After many thoughts, not willing to offend through raſhneſſe, or to offer any vnkindneſſe, he humbly beſought him in true friendſhip which he had found, to pardon him, which could not call to minde no wrong done him, nor any familiaritie that euer had bene betwéene them.
            Well my Lord, quoth the knight, I ſée your minde is frée from reuenge, that know not thoſe that haue endaungered your life, and therefore am the more willing to reueale my ſelfe to cleare you of this doubt. Know that I am Dionicus, the vnhappy Prince of Numedia, who in my fathers Court ſo much abuſed you, whereof I repent me, and haue ſorrowed for it. But pardon me good Cariolus, and accept that friendſhip I vowed vnto you, which wil endeuour to deſerue thy loue in all occaſions wherein true loue conſiſteth. To giue you ſome cauſe to credit what I ſay, I haue thought good to find this opportunitie, not onely to reueale myſelfe to you, whoſe fauour I deſire, but to doo my beſt indeuour to deſerue the ſame, and to aduance thy eſtate, if ſo you can lyke of my offer.
            
               Cariolus, amazed at theſe ſpéeches, after he had with more aduiſed eyes beheld the Prince, was aſſured it was he, proſtrating himſelfe on his knée, humbly beſought his grace of pardon, which had ſo vnreuerently behaued himſelfe. But gratious Prince quoth he, faultes vnwillingly committed, deſerue the leſſe puniſhment, I ſpeake for my ſelfe which am ready to make amendes in performing

The Prince interrupting his ſpéech, louingly imbraced the Lord Cariolus, giuing him many thanks for his

kinde offers, which he was aſſured was faithfully ſpoken. In recompence of which, my Lord (quoth he,) and to make you ſome ſatiſfaction for my former wrong offered you, I will en

            You ſée my Lord, though with ſome trouble and effuſion of blood on either part, the King in peace and quiet enioyeth his owne Countrey, and with the Crowne of his enemie, is like wiſe inueſted. Alluring baytes are kingdomes, and haue cauſed many Nobles, who not content with their owne eſtates, to hazard honour, life, and whatſoeuer elſe they enioyed, to attaine vnto them.
            But my Cariolus, if thou canſt frame thy lyking to my wiſh, and bend thy minde to the loue of Phedera, the Princeſſe, my endeuour ſhall be to obtaine her for thy Ladie, and the Kingdome of Egypt for her dowry, beſides, ſhée is heire to her brother, who dying without iſſue, ſhall to higher honours preferre thée. This is all my Noble Cariolus, that I haue to ſay, (and ſo much I ſay) for that I wiſh thy aduancement, if thou lyke the Ladie, and haue not beſtowed thy lyking elſewhere. Say thy minde, as to him, which not onely in this, but in all other matters wherein I may doo thée good, commaunde mée as thy ſelfe.

                returned many thankes for this vnexſpected good, moued with a deſire of kingly dignitie, well content to enioy ſo braue a princes for his loue, without farther ſtay, ſaid;
            My honored Lord, I cannot frame my tongue to yéelde ſuch thankes as my heart would vtter, onely this good I craue, that your highneſſe continue your gracious fauour towards me, whoſe will ſhall be euer a lawe to Cariolus, who will euer be directed by your maieſties aduiſe. And ſéeing moſt honourable Prince, you haue motion of willingneſſe to do me this good, I humbly beſéech you continue it, and binde Cariolus in euerlaſting bands of true friendſhip to your ſeruice. Here were they interrupted, by the comming

of the King, who hearing that the Prince was gone that way, delighting in his company more then in any others, came ſodainly on them, yet not in ſuch maner, but he was eſpied of them. The King which ſaw them ſo earneſt in their ſpéech, comming vp with them ſaide; Sir Knight, were my Lord Cariolus a Lady, as he is a honorable Gentleman, I ſhould be very ſu

In faith Gentlemen (quoth he,) as there is brotherly loue betwéene you, which the world well noteth, let be a trinitie, and accept me for the third perſon, ſo ſhall you honor me more then I will ſay, and endue me with ſuch happines as I wil not for auoiding of flattry vtter. Your Maieſty quoth the prince, may ieſt, but would it were knowne vnto your grace, our loues to your highneſſe, you might then ſay, you haue ſuch poore friends of vs, as wil euer be ready to aduenture our liues in your honorable ſeruice. Experience good Knight, anſwered the King, long ſithence hath taught me that, whoſe eies are witneſſes of your loyaltie, which I wil endeuour to requite, as when you pleaſe to make triall, you ſhall finde, eſpecially you my Lord, whoſe bloud loſt in aduenturing for me, I can no way requite. Séeing quoth the prince, your highneſſe is thus diſpoſed to ieſt, pardon I beſéech you, what I haue to ſay, and fauour me ſo much, as to heare my humble ſute, (and hearing) let me obtaine it at your gracious hands, in granting which, your grace ſhall more honor me then I dare report. Honorable Knight, anſwered the King, among friends, what ſhould néed diſtruſt, my heart gréeueth, that the noble Knight Pheander, ſhould doubt to obtaine, what euer reſteth in my power to grant. Wherfore ſwéet friend ſay on, for by the honor of the Theſſalian kingdom, whoſe crown I enioy through thy good induſtry, what euer thou requireſt ſhall not be denied. Thankes gracious Lord, not for my ſelf I intreat, but for this gentleman, whoſe heart hauing ſworne fayaltie to loue, which is the ſoueraigne guide of all men, hath framed his lyking

vnto the Princeſſe Phedera, whoſe ſeruant he hath vowed himſelf, if then noble Prince, it ſhall ſtand with your highneſſe good leiſure to accept of him, whoſe honourable birth and haughtie déeds of Chiualry, may merit ſome eſtéeme with perſons of worth, I haue my deſire, (by graunting of which,) and obteining the Princeſſe good lyking, I ſhall be more honored, then if your grace had inueſted me with both the kingdomes of Theſſaly and Egipt.
            
            
               Pheander, quoth the King, if thou hadſt required as much for thy ſelfe as thy friend, thou couldſt not haue honored me more, whoſe amitie I deſire to participate with, aboue all men of what account ſo euer: but ſéeing thy requeſt is for him whoſe aduancement I deſire, and for thou ſhalt know in what regard I hold thy loue, I will do my beſt to procure her loue, women haue fancies, and are headſtrong in their affects, whether ſhe haue granted her loue I know not, neither can I force her lyking, if I could, it were not conuenient, for a forced beaſt is froward, and women wedded to their will. If in their loue they ſhould be contraried, were better loſt then found, their reuenging mindes are ſuch, as they will not be quiet, vntill for their huſbandes ſafetie they haue armed his head with ſuch proofe, that hée may walfe in ſafetie amongſt the beſt headed ſtags in my Forreſt. But leauing this ieſt, (Pheander) that thou maiſt aſſure thee of my loue, my induſtry ſhall be to gaine her for thy friend, whom I both honour and loue, and for you my Lord, I giue heartie thanks, that will accept of her, whom I (may ſay) I loue as a brother, who if I can perſwade, to your wiſh, her large dowry ſhall teſtifie. Our pleaſant parley hath procured me a good appetite, my ſtomacke telleth me it is dinner time, wherefore Gentlemen, leauing this talke which is as much conqueſt as the greateſt of Hercules, which did neuer conquere woman, (vnto me) let vs walke, and doubt not but I will play the Orator in ſuch wiſe as ſhall procure your content Lord Cariolus, and ſatiſfie your requeſt. Thanks gracious Prince quoth Cariolus,
               
which is all I haue to requite ſo great a benefit, onely your true liegeman ſhall I euer continue, and be readie at your pleaſure to do you ſeruice.
            Here Gentlemen, the ſtory telleth vs, that the Thracian King, (as fleſh is mortall) vexed with an extreme ſicknes, was ſo oppreſſed therewith, that nature failing through weake age, all phiſicke helpes were friuolous, ſo that perforce he muſt pay his due to death which commandeth all, whoſe breath failing at the ſommon of this tyrant, which may not be intreated, his ſoule departed this earthly trunk, to ſée the ioyes of the euerlaſting kingdome, whoſe death his ſubiects ſo with pittious plaintes bewailed, as might haue changed the moſt hardeſt heart into a Caos of lamenting ſorrowes, beholding their teares, whoſe bodie was moſt royally intombed amongſt his Anceſtry. But among thoſe which ſorrow ouerwhelmed, and had like to haue drowned in deaths gulph, the Princeſſe, whom nature forced in ſome ſort to lamēt, as a child hauing loſt her father, was ſo weakened with her plaints and hearts ſorrow, that long time it was not to be thought ſhe could recouer it, ſo much was her tender heart touched, eftſoones bewailing her fathers death, and then againe, gréeuing for the want of her Loue and Lord the Mayden Knight, of whoſe ſafetie whom ſhe more deſired then to be Lady of the whole earth, could not be perſwaded. Long did ſhe languiſh in theſe extreames and could not be comforted, in ſo much that ſhe rather deſired death then to liue. But he that in extreames is our beſt comfort, preſeruing her for the Commons benifit, ſent her health, who being recouered, the Coronation finiſhed, and the Crown by common conſent of the Parliament confirmed vnto her, many offers of marriages were made vnto her, for which, humble ſutes of her Counc
                  •
               ll were not omitted, who deſired nothing more, then to haue the iſſue of her noble bodie ſucceed her. But no perſwaſions might moue her from the Knight, who had the chiefe intereſt of her hart, to whom ſhe had vowed her ſelfe, proteſting

likewiſe, neuer to grant her loue or liking to any one, but onely to him. This reſolution ſo much gréeued her nobles, that nothing could breed more diſcontent, yet as dutie commanded, framed themſelues to her gouernment, who with ſuch wiſedom directed all things for the benefit of her common weale, that it was admirable to behold that wiſdome in one of her ſexe.
            But to return to our matter. The Theſſalian King, who minding his honourable word with the noble Pheander, finding opportunitie, ganne queſtion his ſiſter in this maner.
            
               Phedera, ſince the deceaſe of our deare parence, thou haſt bene left vnto my gouernment, for whom, (without boaſt) or deſire of benefit of thée or any, I haue had that care as of mine owne good, and euer will, ſo thou be ruled by me. And for I ſée thy yeares requireth to be linked in marriage, that thou maiſt participate in loue with thy huſband, and ſpend the prime of thy yeares as is fitting thy eſtate, I haue found a Gentleman of honor and valour, ſuch a one, as on my word loueth thée, and I haue cauſe for his paines in my ſeruice imployd to honor. Therefore good ſiſter, if thou loue me as a brother, and haſt not beſtowed thy loue elſewhere, in this matter be ruled by mée, and in dooing whereof, thou ſhalt finde mée thy brother, and moſt aſſured friend, who will euer be as carefull of thy well doing and honor, as of mine good. Say therefore thy minde plainly, and let me knowe whether thou doeſt loue, or canſt loue?
            The Lady, whoſe wiſedome was ſuch as balanced her honor, not knowing whether her brother were in in ieſt or earneſt, thus modeſtly ſaid; Gracious Lord, and my dread ſoueraigne, pardon I humbly beſéech you, your ſubiect, and ſuffer mée not through my fond anſwering ſo friuolous a queſtion, which you vrge but for my triall, to procure your diſpleaſure, or mine owne ſhame.
            Why Phedera, quoth the King, you miſtake me, if you

thinke I ieaſt, for on my honor, I meane what I ſay, therfore dally not with mée, if you hope of my good. But tell me if thou doeſt loue, or wilt loue my friend?
            The Ladie hearing the King in earneſt, although ſhée could be well content to haue enioyed the ſwéet pleaſures of loue in marriage, thus ſayd; Dread Lord, and my moſt gracious ſoueraigne, ſithence it is your pleaſure I ſhould anſwere your demaunde, Know, that as modeſtie is the ornament of Maydes, and chaſtitie, the garland that bewtifieth all our ſexe, ſo haue I carefully weyed mine honor in ſuch manner, that I neither loue, nor as yet euer made choyce of any in loue, but haue eſchewed all ſuch friuolous motions of the fleſh, to my greateſt power, as beſéemeth a Lady of ſuch honor. That I may loue, I doubt not, becauſe it is the commandement of our maker, and incident to all creatures, who in their kindes make choyce of ſome one to participate with: yet ſhall my loue neuer be ſuch, as may diſparage your highneſſe loue towards me, but ſuch as ſhall be to your content. And for your graces pleaſure is to beſtow me on a man ſo honorable, ſo ſtandeth it with your will to let mée knowe him, I will anſwere more directly.
            God a mercy for that wench, quoth the King, then I doubt not but wée ſhall haue a match, or elſe thy wiſedome is not ſuch as I wiſh it were. But tell mée vnfeinedly my Phedera, canſt thou loue the Lord Cariolus, a man for birth honorable, for valour, to compare with moſt aduenturing Knightes in the worlde, in perſon comely, and ſo dibonire in his behauiour, as for curteſie hée is to bee matched with the beſt? Hée is the man Madame, whom if you can fancie, thou honoureſt mée in thy loue, and thou ſhalt finde mée a brother, nay a father, if fathers loue may excéed the brothers▪ Say therefore thy minde, and let me know thy anſwere?
            The Ladie whoſe hope was, her brothers ſute had

bene for the Mayden Knight, with whoſe loue ſhe was a little touched, yet modeſtie maſtering ſuch fond motions, would not let affection take ſuch roote but that ſhée could at her pleaſure expell it.
            After the Lady had heard her brother, whom ſhe perceiued by his earneſtneſſe in vttering his ſute, would not willingly be denied, ſhe ſaid; Pardon me my good Lord, if I paſſe modeſtie, conſidering your great praiſe of the Gentleman, beléeue me, he is much beholding vnto your Grace, who could haue thought you would haue prooued ſo good a ſoliciter? had your ſtudie bene the Lawes of this Realme, no doubt, but you ſhould haue had many Clyants: were the Gentleman here himſelfe, he could not haue ſayd thus much, and therefore he may thinke himſelfe beloued and honored of your highneſſe. But for anſwere, as I would not haue you in your firſt wooing diſgraced, leaſt it diſcourage you in your owne enterpriſes being a batcheler, ſo can I ſay little of my ſelfe, who is to be gouerned by you, to, whom in all humbleneſſe I referre me, and ſhall ſo you be pleaſed, be content, if it were with one not ſo worthie as the Lord Cariolus. (And yet)
            Nay Madam, quoth the King, leaue not off ſo abruptly with an aparentizes, your words are doubtfull. Tell mée therfore, is there any other before me? if there be, and thou haſt made choyce, (and you both agreed) I will not gainſay it, nor tye thée to any other then thy owne content in mariage. Therefore ſay, what thoſe words (and yet) imported?
            Pardon my ouer boldneſſe, gracious Lord, anſwered the Lady, which vnaduiſedly ouerpaſt thoſe ſpéeches, and credit my word, which haue no loue fixed in my heart, but will endeuour my ſelfe to the liking of him whom you ſhall commaund me, yet will I anſwer your demaund, and meaning of thoſe words, taken ſo by your grace at rebounde, though I muſt and will, frame me to the loue and liking of the Lord Cariolus. Yet had the noble Generall bene pleaſed, and with that, a déep ſigh ſtaid her tongue, in ſuch wiſe,

as ſhe could go no farther.
            The King vnderſtanding which way the winde of her deſire blew, though he could haue bene better content with her choyce, yet to put her from other thoughts, and to haue his ſute take effect, he perſwaded her to let ſlip ſuch fonde imaginations, for that he had placed his loue on a Ladie of his Country, whom he would not leaue for all the world. With theſe happie tidings for the Lord Cariolus, after ſome other kinde ſpéeches to y• Lady, the King departed, ſo ioying in his good ſucceſſe, y• he could not reſt vntill he had comforted the Lord Cariolus with his anſwer, whoſe mind egged on by the Mayden Knight, was ſo fixed on the Lady, that ſhe was become the miſtreſſe of his heart, and he ioyed in nothing but in contemplating of her loue, thinking euery day a yeare, and euery houre a month, vntil he heard the Kings anſwere, muſing thus on his Loue, toſſing with a minde diſquietted, from one ſide the bedde to the other, his Page brought him word, that a Gentleman from the King, attended to ſpeake with him, which ſodaine newes, reuiued ſo his ſpirits, as made his heart more light, then long time before it had bene, hoping to here ſuch happie tidings as his louing ſute required. The Meſſenger hauing deliuered his meſſuage, iudge you that be louers, whether you could ſlack any time vntil you heard the doome of your miſtreſſe, which he was aſſured to do by the King, vnto whom he haſteneth with ſuch ſpéed as he could. To whoſe preſence being come, the king as ioyful for his good ſucceſſe and his ſiſters grant, as the Lorde Cariolus to heare it, with a ſmiling countenance, which ſhewed the ioy of his heart, ſaid;
            My Lord, though my ſkill in wooing be but ſmall, hauing neuer accuſtomed my ſelfe to any ſuch practiſe, yet haue I playd the cunning Aduocate for your Lordſhip, and will aſſure you, ſo you holde your word and promiſe, the Princeſſe ſhall be yours, and thereon take my word of honour.
            
               Cariolus, ſo ouer ioyed at theſe tydings, could not well

tell whether he heard the King ſpeake, or dreamed of this happineſſe. But ſtanding a while in an extacie, his ſences being come againe, with eyes gaſtly beholding the King, thus ſaid; My honourable and gracious Lord, what may I doo to requite your Princely fauour, who hath vouchſafed me ſo great honor, not onely to beſtowe your onely ſiſter on me, but to become my honorable ſoliciter, what I would ſay, modeſtie compelleth me to conceale. Only this I aſſure your Maieſtie, my loyall ſeruice ſhall euer be ready at your commaund, in ſuch dutifull maner, that your Maieſty ſhall haue no cauſe to repent you of ſo great a good done vnto a ſtranger. Inough my Lord, fewe words doth ſuffice among friendes, wherefore forbeare theſe ſpéeches, loue my ſiſter, and for her ſake, thinke of me as a friend, which will be euer ready to do you what pleaſure I can. To giue you ſome intereſt of my faith, appoint the marriage day at your pleaſure, and for her dowry, accept this kingdom of Egypt, which ſhall remaine to you and your heires for euer, onely this homage ſhall you yearely tender in my Court of Theſſaly, two ſwift running Courſers of this Countrey, and ſo God make you happie in your loue, and a ioyfull father of many children. With this the Mayden Knight entered his preſence, vnto the King what man ſo welcome, his dutie done, the King louingly imbracing him, ſaid;
            Sir Knight, I haue not long ſithence comforted your friend with my happie tydings, and not onely aſſured him of a wife, which I hope will prooue louing and kinde vnto him, but haue inueſted him with the tytle of King of Egipt, of both which, I wiſh him ſo much ioy, as I deſire to haue ioy, his wedding day let him appoynt at his pleaſure, which ſhall with the greateſt honour I can be performed.
            Moſt gracious and dread Lord quoth the Knight, how this your honourable curteſie haue tyed mee vnto your ſeruice, I omit, that at my requeſt hath thus fauoured my deare friend, whoſe good I eſtéeme as mine owne, and euer

will be readie with my beſt endeuour to ſerue, at all times and places where my force or ſeruice may do either your Maieſtie or my Lord Cariolus good. And ſéeing it is wrought to his content and your Graces good lyking, let mée intreate this fauoure of you both, that the wedding may ſodainly be ſolemnized, for that my ſtaie may not be long here, ſuch deſire I haue to ſée my ſoueraigne Lorde, who I am ſure exſpecteth my return long before this time. Sir quoth the King, did you knowe how diſpleaſing thoſe ſpéeches of your departure were to me, that deſire nothing in the whole world ſo much as your company, you would neuer harpe ſo much on that ſtring. But how long ſo euer your ſtaie ſhall be, this day eight dayes I doo appoint for the wedding, ſo my Lorde Cariolus be agreed, and ſay Amen.
            
            Neuer quoth Cariolus, let him be allowed for Clarke, which refuſeth to ſay Amen, to ſuch a parſon, the Orizons bringing ſuch content, ſéeing your Maieſtie referres it to me, Amen ſay I, and humbly thanke your Grace for your honourable fauour.
            The wedding day appoynted and aſſigned, the King ſent for the Princeſſe, who that night ſupped all togither, which being ended, the Princeſſe, in preſence of many of the Lordes of Theſſaly and Egypt, was betrothed vnto the Lord Cariolus, and the marriage day appoynted, againſt which time, were all the nobles ſommoned to be at Court to attend the King, by whoſe commandement all the preparation for honour of that day might be deuiſed, was ordeined, the time of night being ſpent, ſommoned their watchfull eyes to ſléepe, wherefore after many ſolemne adues, taken one of the other, they haſtened on all ſides to their reſt, onely Cariolus and the Princeſſe beſt content, ſhée ioying in her Loue, and kingly brothers lyking, and he bleſſing a million of times the day wherein he firſt ſaw the Prince, procurer of his ſo great good. What other imaginations aſſailed them, let thoſe ſuppoſe and thinke

which haue felt the ſwéet cōtent in loue. To which I leaue them, to recount vnto you y• ſorrow of the Thracian Quéen, who ruling with honor, beloued both of Pheres and Commons, in as much royaltie as might be deſired, endured ſo many ſundry torments of minde, wanting her moſt deſire, that the day was irkeſome vnto her, and the night ordeined for reſt, reſtleſſe ſhe conſumed, that with her continual watchings, and others paſſions, he
                  •
                bodie became weake, and a gréeuous ſickneſſe aſſailed her, the cauſe, none could imagine, neither might phiſicke miniſter any cure to her diſeaſe, ſo that giuen ouer to the death, ſhe lanquiſhed in great extremities, not daring for modeſtie, to reueale the cauſe, onely this was her chéefeſt comfort, when ſhe could be freed from the company of ſuch Ladies and counſellers which viſited her, with Guenela to recount her loue, ſometime extolling his valour and perſon, and eftſoones accuſing him of diſloyaltie, exclaiming on her hard fortune which had engaged her libertie to a Knight careleſſe of her honour and good, curſing and accuſing Guenela, being ſoliciter for ſuch a wretched Knight, whoſe ſpéeches oftentimes was ſo anſwered by the Mayden Guenela, as in ieſting wiſe would ſhe turne her words of deſpight into laughter, ſuch was the ſharpneſſe of her wit, which left no meanes vnſought that might procure in the leaſt maner her content. Oppreſſed with great griefe we leaue the Princes for a while, to returne vnto Cariolus. whoſe wedding day being come great was the ioy on his ſide, but more the preparation of al courtiers, who were ready with many coſtly ſhewes, at y• Tilt, Turney, and Barriers, to try their valour and fortunes in Armes. But as the faireſt day is ouercaſt with cloudes, ſo was their mirth chaunged to great and gréeuous lamentions, and their ioy to ſorrowfull complaints, which thus befell.
            The King now in prime of yeares, deſirous to try his force at the Tilt, with his preſence to honour his Nobles and do the Princeſſe fauoure at her marriage in theſe paſtimes,

made choyce of the Mayden Knight, to encounter him, as the worthieſt in Armes, who being of all others moſt vnwilling to deale againſt him, humbly beſought his grace of pardon, and accept of ſome his Nobles who was more worthier of that honor. But the King with whom no intreaties might preuaile, wold not be denied, which made the Knight with great heauineſſe of heart to wiſh hée had not Armed him that day, ſuch was his diſcontented minde, which doubtleſſe preſaged ſome enſuing euill, as to y• great griefe of all the whole company hapned them. Thus when no denials might preuail, the trumpets ſounding a charge, they ſet forward with ſuch ſwiftneſſe, as the earth trembled vnder their horſes, both breaking their ſtaues in ſuch manner, as all the company with ioyful ſhoutes applauded their excellent ſkill in that exerciſe. But alaſſe, in midſt of this pleaſing practiſe, how ſuddainly their ioyes were eclipſed, woe is me to recount. The King and his elected companion, at the trumpets ſound, ſetting with courage forward to encounter one the other, in braue maner brake again their ſtaues, but in an vnhappie time, a ſplinter of the knights ſtaffe, by moſt vnfortunate chaunce, entered the ſight of the Kings Beauer, which pearced the head to the brain, in ſuch wiſe, that with the heate of his trauaile, and griefe of the wound, he was enforced to forſake his horſe. This ſuddaine miſhap, to the company brought ſuch diſcontent, that all their mirth layd apart, ſorrow was made Lady of the feaſt. But amongſt thoſe that moſt lamented this vnfortunate chaunce, the Maiden Knight had his part, whoſe griefe was ſuch, that had not the Lord Cariolus bin by fortune preſent, in the extreame of his melancholy paſſion he had ſlain himſelfe, ſuch was the wiſedome of the Noble Cariolus, as his reaſonable perſwaſions preuailed ſo with him, as he cauſed him forſake his dolefull Lodge, to accompany him to the preſence of y• king, whoſe maſters of Chirurgery, had newly ended their trauaile of dreſſing his woundes, them the Knight queſtioned of the danger therof, and beſought them

in curteſie to acquaint him therewith, whether hée held it mortall or no, which how vnwilling ſo euer they were, as loath to diſcomfort the King or thoſe which loued him, ſuch was the curteous entreatie of the Knight, as he could not conceale the daunger thereof, but reuealed vnto him the little hopes they had of his life, and the reaſons that induced them thereunto, which newes, was little pleaſing vnto the Knight, who with many teares lamented that miſhap, but griefe miniſtreth no phiſicke to the diſeaſed, nor ſorrow auaileth not to mittigate extreames. Wherefore by Cariolus comforted, hée ceaſeth in ſo excéeding maner to lament, determining to abide the Kings doome, vnto whom he purpoſeth to reconcile himſelfe, and to that intent awaiteth the waking of his Maieſtie, who was after his dreſſing fallen a ſléepe, whoſe griefe was ſuch, as hée could take ſmall reſt. But rowſing himſelfe, awaked from his ſlumber, called for the Lord Cariolus, who was wayting for the ſame purpoſe, vnto whome being come, hée ſaith;
            
               Cariolus, let no man boaſt himſelfe of happineſſe which is mortall, for that they are ſubiect to croſſes, and caſual miſhaps, as thy ſelfe maiſt witneſſe with me, and many others that haue ſéene this miſchaunce befallen mée, when I leaſt expected it, the originall of my griefe procéeding from my ſelfe, which woulde perforce my good friend to the action whereunto he was ſo vnwillingly drawne: but what heauens haue ordeined, what man can gainſay. The omnipotent power of the Almightie, hath laid his croſſe on me for my greater good, to call me from theſe worldes vanities, to ſéeke his euerlaſting kingdome: Yet ere I leaue this fraile life, ſwéete Cariolus let me ſée that honourable Knight, by whoſe hands death ſent his ſommance, deare he was vnto mée, and his loue worthie to be imbraced of the mightieſt Monarke. Oh Pheander, couldeſt thou but imagine with what faithfull loue I loued thée, thou maiſt ſorrow for my loſſe, whome thou and all the worlde cannot reclaime from

this great hazard wherein I remain. With this the knight which was not farre off, preſented himſelfe vnto him, who knéeling at his beds ſide, ſaid;
            Moſt gracious ſoueraign, might my gréeued hart which ouerwhelmed in ſorrow, is 
                  〈…〉
                in a ſea of many miſeries, conſume it ſelfe with griefe, for my euill committed againſt you, how happie a creature were I, which haue bin the occaſion of your highneſſe ſo great vnreſt, yet how vnwilling, heauens record with me. And therefore my dread ſoueraigne, pardon my fault ſo vnwillingly committed againſt your Maieſtie, as deare to me as mine owne ſoule, whoſe life, if ten thouſands liues depended thereon, I wiſh might be ſacrificed for thy health, and the louing ſubiects of of my gracious ſoueraigne, whom by my ouer-hardineſſe, I haue robbed of ſo louing a Prince. Let me I ſay, chiefe cauſer of your ſorrow, reape the guerdon due to a murtherer, and reuēge your kings death, by taking my life, which had I a million of thouſands liues, could not make ſatiſfactiō for my euil committed againſt you. Here teares interrupting him, denyed his tongue libertie of ſpéech, whoſe lamentation, filled all the nobles with ſuch heauineſſe, as for teares they could not vtter a word, eſpecially the King, whoſe grief being great, was encreaſed by his dolefull lament, yet caſting of this womaniſh humor, drying his eyes, doubting the nobles and thoſe preſent, ſhuld accuſe him of fear, (dreading to die) wherunto we are all born, with a ſoft voice, tenderly wringing the Mayden Knight by the hand, hée ſaith; Noble Gentleman, ceaſe thy heauineſſe, thy griefe ſo augments mine, that the thought thereof, wrings teares from my heart, thy vnwilling offence, with my heart I forgiue, and to ſhew how deare in life thou waſt vnto me, (my good Pheander) accept at my dying hand, my kingdom of Theſſaly, the lawfull inheritance of thy faithfull friend, loue thoſe people, my kind ſubiects, & ſo gouern them with fauour and lenity, as they haue no cauſe to complain of my dead courſe, & for my life which by thy hand through y• apointmēt of him

that gaue it me, I muſt leaue, I heartily forgiue thée, and accurſed be he or them, which ſhal euer impute i
                  •
                vnto thée, in diſhonour, any fault againſt me committed. That thou louedſt mée, thy tender care of my good hath ſhewed ſuche proofes, as tyed me in true friendſhip to be thine for euer, Death is not ſo irkeſome vnto me, but that I muſt leaue thée, and the ſwéete content I receiued in thy company: grief of my deaths grief, my own Pheander, compelleth me omit what I would ſay, wherefore briefly thus; Forget not thy dying friend, and ſhew that loue to my Lord Cariolus, whom for thy ſake, I haue to this Crowne of Egipt aduanced, as I euer found, and in extremes comfort him with thy aide, as thou haſt done me, my ſiſter Phedera forget not, whom to thy charge I commit, leauing her to thée, and thée to be in my place a brother, who liuing loued her, as my hope is thou wilt. And ſo deare friends, heauens bleſſednes befall you all, and ſo proſper you, as I loued you. And you Pheres of Egipt and Theſſaly, whoſe loue I haue found as ſubiects, in all dutifull maner, let be continued vnto theſe your elected Kings, who will with honour gouerne you, ſo ſhall the giuer of all happineſſe bleſſe your lands, with the bleſſing of peace and plenty, for they that honor their king, doth reuerence the Lord who created him, and he wil giue them plenteous rewards. Noble Gentlemen, griefe cutteth me off, fleſh muſt yéeld to earth how loath ſoeuer, the mightieſt, death hath vanquiſhed. Therefore as my Vltenam vale, remember my words, and pray God to ſend vs the abundance of his grace, that we may through his mercy, haue a ioyfull méeting in his kingdome that neuer ſhall haue end. I féele the heauy meſſenger approaching, therefore farwell to thée my deare ſiſter, whom I charge as thou louedſt mée liuing, be louing and kinde to thy huſband, doing him that honor is due vnto him, thy children bring vp in fear of their maker, and ſo God bleſſe thée with happineſſe. And thou Pheander, vnto me, no creature in life more deare, remember my parting ſpéeches, loue the Lord Cariolus, as I haue

loued thée, and thou my adopted brother Cariolus, honour him during thy life, that I am ſure faithfully tendered and loued thée, ſo ſhall God be pleaſed, for no ſin in ſight of his diuine deitie, is more intollerable then that monſtrous vice of Ingratitude, which for auoyding the heauy wrath of of God, I wiſh thée eſchue. Nobles and you all my very good friends, to exhort you to remember your duties, whoſe wiſdomes is more then I will recount, were a matter friuolous, and perhaps may moue ſome offence, yet take my ſimple meaning which ſpeake to you that haue ouer-loued me, which loue let be continued, honor your Kings with reuerence and loue, for what you do to them, is done to God, which are his Vize-Regents on earth, and his annoynted. Moue no rebelliō, nor be mainteiner of euil, for ſuch faults, how ſecret ſo euer, God will to your ouerthrowes reueale. Remember his word, which hath commanded you to be obedient without murmuring, and feare him which gouerneth all. I can ſay no more, my ſpéech faileth me, therefore generally my Lords, farewell, and ſo turning his weak bodie to the wall, ſurrendered his ſoule to the heauens, from whence it had his being, to the intollerable griefe of all his ſubiects, who with many briniſh tears lamented his death, but eſpecially the Knight Pheander, and Cariolus, whoſe marriage, the louing King honoured, with his funerall, which in the moſt honourableſt maner, Art or honor could deuiſe, was ſolemnized, lamented generally of all his ſubiects, but eſpecially the Egyptians, who more dearly loued him for his clemency, then their owne naturall King.
            The funerall finiſhed, a Parliament was ſommoned, in which time, the Mayden Knight ſo preuailed with the Nobles of Theſſaly and Egipt, that by common conſent of the whole aſſembly in both houſes, temporall and ſpirituall, the regiment of both kingdomes, was deliuered vnto the Lord Cariolus, and the Mayden Knight, reſigned his intereſt for euer vnto him and the Lady, who was lawfull inheritrix vnto the ſame. The Parliament proroged according

to the cuſtome of the Country, great preparation was made for the Coronation, which in moſt ſolemne and honourable manner was accompliſhed, with ſo many ſundry ſhowes and delightfull pleaſures, as might weary you to reade. Let it ſuffice to the great ioy of both Realmes, all things to ſo honorable an action was ſo exquiſitely performed, as no man but tooke great delight in beholding therof, praying with an vniuerſall voice for their long liues, to be in happineſſe amongſt them continued.
            Thus all things to the ioy of the noble Pheander accompliſh, and to the high content of the King Cariolus and his Quéen, by the aduiſe of the Mayden Knight, an election was made of a Vizeroy to goe for Theſſaly, the King making choyce of two euils the leaſt, conceiuing this opinion of the naturall ſubiects of Theſſalie, that they would liue in their dutifull obeiſance, when a conquered nation gathering hed vppon many light occaſions, was eaſily drawne to reuolt. Theſe conſiderations with great wiſdom weyed, the Lord Fardinand, one of the priuy Councell of Theſſaly, was elected for that gouernment, vnto whome, the King after his Commiſſion ſigned, and honorable gifts giuen, ſo wiſely exhorted to obedience, and care of his loue and dutie, that as many of the nobles as were preſent, and noted the ſame, admired him, reioyſing that God had prouided ſo for them, to leaue them in the gouernment of ſo toward a Prince, of whom ſo much enſuing happineſſe was exſpected.
            Order taken for his affaires of waight, the Vizeroy imbarqued for Theſſaly, and his Nobles departed, each one to their ſeuerall mantions, ſauing ſuch of his priuy Councell which were attendant at Court. The Noble Pheander, was now to take his leaue, the very remembrance whereof, was more offenſiue to the King and Quéen, then al their former troubles. Bootles it was to intreat his longer ſt
                  •
               y, who ſtanding on thornes, til his deſire was obteined, in beholding the moſt beautifull Princeſſe, might no longer be perſuaded, wherefore the King to honour him the more,

by whom he was for euer honoured, cauſed a Fléete to be prepared of twentie Gallies, whom by his ſtrict commandement, was moſt royally furniſhed with all néedfull vyands, and other neceſſaries for his voyage, which on ſuch ſodain was purueyed, as might well ſhew their diligence to whom that great charge was committed. All things readie for his departure, and a faire winde blowing a freſhe and comfortable gale, theſe friendes were nowe to depart.
            After leaue taken of the Princeſſe, who with many briniſh teares bewailed the ſame, the King with his Pheres accompanied him to the water ſide, where his company appointed to attend him, awaited his comming, where after heauy parting on both ſides, and many teares ſpent of the commons which beheld their ſorrowes, he imbarqued him ſelfe, and by the good fauour of the windes, and diligent induſtry of his Marriners, ſodainly loſ
                  •
                ſight of land, and had the winde ſo fauourable, that in ſhort time they atteined ſight of the high land of Thrace, with which they beare all that they might, yet could not poſſibly recouer their Port that night.
            This Fleete of Gallies being on the ſhore deſcried, none could imagine what they were or ſhould be, to preuent the worſt, the Councell carefull of their own ſafeties, and commons good, aſſembled, the power of their Citie, making prouiſion for defence, what euer happened.
            The maiſter of the Admirall, not daring to enter the harbourght by night, laie off again into the ſea, hulling vntill the day watch was in hand, at which time they ſet ſaile to goe for their harbourght, and by fauourable aſſiſtance of the windes, recouered the ſame. After the Sunne had ſhewed her ſelfe in her bewtie two houres, to ſuruey which power, and to giue notiſe to the Quéene what they were, the Lord Aminta
                     •
                  , Lord high Admirall of the lande, was in a Frygotte ſent, who bouging as much as the force of his ſtaues would permit him, being a man honorable and

venterous, not knowing what they were, whether friends or enemies, came vp with the Admiral, and laid her aboord, of whoſe comming, the Mayden Knight being aduertiſed, doing him dutie, cauſed his Flagge to be furled, and his Auncient to be taken downe, whoſe order the whole Fléete followed. When the Admirall ſaw the Knight Pheander, whoſe welfare they greatly doubted, betwéene them was much reioycing and many imbracings, as friends ioyfull to ſee one the other. Paſſing in pleaſant parley the time, they came to Ancor, at which time, according to directions giuen by the Knight, all their ordinance was diſcharged, with their ſmal Artillery, reioycing according to the ſea maner, for their ſafe arriuall, to the great admiration of all the beholders, which could imagin no certaintie what they were: no ſooner was the Ancors ground, but the Lord Admirall cauſing his Frygot to come aboord, entered the ſame, accompanied with the Mayden Knight, and other Nobles of Theſſaly and Egypt, which came to accompany him, as Embaſſadors from the King, who were all moſt royally entertemed of the Nobles, which attended their landing, and were conducted to the Court, where according to their eſtates they were ſumptuouſly lodged in the Court, and like order taken for purueying for their traine.
            Amongſt others that had enquired the newes of theſe ſtrangers, and what they were, Guenela by chance, as women are inquiſitiue of nouelties, had with diligence learned what thoſe Nobles ſo royally enterteined were, with the arriuall of the Mayden Knight, who was no ſooner knowne vnto the ioyfull Mayden, (made more ioyfull by theſe happie tydings) but ſtanding en thornes vntill ſhée came to the preſence of the Quéene, doubting leaſt her news ſhould be ſo ſtale before ſhe came, as it wold be ſcares worth the carriage, ſhe omitted no time. To whom being come, and finding the Quéen in her accuſtomed melancholly paſſions, though new ſome way otherwiſe imployed about the imaginations of theſe ſtraungers, to put her from

her ſtudy, thus ſaid.
            What Madame, euer in your memento, in faith were I of your priuie counſ
                  •
               ll, and might perſwade with you, I would wiſh your Maieſtie become Lady of ſome Nunnery, where you might haue companie, ſince nothing may delight you but contemplation.
            
               Guenela quoth the Quéene, ceaſe thy fond talke at this time, and giue me leaue, who haue matters of waight to imploy me on.
            If it be ſo Madame, (quoth Guenela) I am to craue pardon for my boldneſſe, otherwiſe, if it might not haue bene offenciue, I could haue acquainted your highnes with ſome newes of the Mayden Knight, which becauſe I ſée it is troubleſome vnto you hauing buſineſſe, I beſéech your grace licence me to depart, vntill it ſhall pleaſe your Ladiſhip to finde leiſure to heare me.
            The Quéen hearing her name the Mayden Knight, was ſo waked from her dumps, as ſhe called Guenela, and with earneſt intreaties beſought her to let her know, what news ſhe had heard of thoſe ſtraungers, and what moued her to name the Mayden Knight?
            
            Madam, (quoth Guenela,) if your Ladiſhip would haue permitted me to ſpeake, I had without farther delaies, acquainted you with ſuch news of theſe ſtrangers, as I hear, and haue diligently enquired, who are Nobles of Theſſaly, in Embaſſage for y• King, accompanied with the beſt welcomed Knight in Affrica. The péerleſſe Pheander, your graces ſworne ſeruant, the naming of whom, ſo reuiued the Quéene, that he that had the worſt ſight might haue perceiued how pleaſing theſe newes were vnto her, yet doubtfull of her Maydens ſpéeches, which often had deluded her, to moue delight, the ſaid;
            
               Guenela, thou haſt had more pleaſure in féeding me with vaine hopes, then hath contented me, yet haue I borne thy follies, imagining in what ſort they were vſed. But now Guenela, leaue thy Ieſts, leaſt they grow odious, and moue

me to chollor againſt thée, which would not willingly be drawne vnto. Therefore tell me without dallying, is my knight arriued with theſe Nobles, or is there certaine tyings of his good health by theſe ſtrangers?
            Madame (quoth Guenela,) if my ouer-boldneſſe haue incurred your diſpleaſure, I humbly craue pardō, who had no intent to offend, he witneſſe with me, which ſearcheth my déepeſt ſecrets, but to aſſure you of what you ſo much deſire, know Madame, the Mayden Knight is with Nobles arriued, who as I heare, are come from the Lord Cariolus, who by procurement of the Mayden Knight, is maried with the Princeſſe of Theſſaly, and is royally Crowned by conſent of both Realmes, lawfull King of Theſſaly and Egypt, the one, his Quéenes lawfull inheritance, the other, the late Kings bequeſt, who by vnhappie fortune, hath left this life. Thus Madame haue I acquainted your highneſſe with what I haue heard, the truth thereof being proued, I hope will procure my pardon. Guenela (quoth the Quéene, ten thouſand times I thanke thée for thy tydings, which I wil ſo requite, as it ſhall be the beſt newes that euer paſſed thy mouth, to giue thée ſom aſſurance therof, take this Diamond, which ſhe pulling from her finger, deliuered her, and looke for a better reward. The haſtie approaching of the Councell, interrupting their ſpéech, cauſed them ceaſe their farther parley, who ſtaying the Quéenes pleaſure, ſent her word, they had ſome matter to impart vnto her, who were preſently admitted to her preſence, accompanied with the Mayden Knight.
            
            The Councell hauing done their duties, the Mayden Knight preſented himſelfe vnto her Maieſtie, whoſe ſight ſo appalled her, as ſhe could ſay nothing, ſhamefaſt modeſtie ſtriuing with her willingneſſe to bid him welcome, which ſhe could not doo as ſhe would, leaſt her countenance ſhould diſcloſe her hearts deſire, yet not omitting ſuch honorable fauour as ſhe could do him, ſhe offered her hand to kiſſe, which in al humbleneſſe he accepted, acknowledging

his moſt bounden dutie vnto her highneſſe, whom the queſtioned in this maner.
            Seruant quoth ſhée, we had thought your lyking had bene ſuch to the Dames of Theſſaly, as we ſhould haue bin inuited to your wedding, or that your entertainment had bene ſo euill in our Court, as you were weary of the ſame, that you haue thus long abſented your ſelfe from our Preſence, (vnder Benidicitie) ſeruant, as you owe dutie to your miſtreſſe, make mée your ghoaſtly father, and before my Lordes here preſent, tell me and diſſemble not, what hath bene the cauſe of your long ſtaie?
            Gracious ſoueraigne, quoth the Knight, if I anſwere what is truth, I hope your Maieſtie will accept it, and pardon mée, if in my harſhe anſwere I paſſe thoſe duties which I would not willingly doo. For my loue to forraine Ladies, I may iuſtly deny, which neither ſawe any ſince my departure from your Confines, in whoſe preſence I tooke pleaſure: During my long ſtaie, how vnwilling that hath bene, I call to reccord theſe Nobles ſtrangers, which can teſtifie my long deſire to haue tendered my dutifull ſeruice vnto your highneſſe, whereunto I am bound. Therefore dread Lady, pardon my offence therein, who being at a forraigne Princeſſe commandement, muſt obey it.
            Well ſeruant quoth the Quéene, I muſt giue credit to your words, elſe ſhould I do you wrong, but how ſo euer, you are wel

               Now returne we to the Nobles, who awaited her highneſſe pleaſure, for which, the Quéene counting of her ſpéech with the knight, thus ſaid;
            Honorable Lords, if it be no matter of counſel for which your comming is at this time, let vs know the cauſe, my ſeruant I dare commit ſome truſt vnto, who ſhall participate of theſe your affaires. Mightie Princeſſe, (quoth the Lord Parſinio,) matter of ſtate concerning the gouernment or affaires of your Common-weale, we haue not to vtter, but onely do beſéech your highneſſe, to commaund for your honor, that theſe noble ſtrangers be enterteined according to their eſtates, with ſuch curteſie and bountie, that they many haue cauſe to ſpeake of your Court and honorable entertainment, as of a worthy deſeruing Prince. And more, to do your noble ſubiects honor, the Lord Cariolus, who by marriage of the deceaſed Kings ſiſter, is Crowned lawfull King both of Theſſalie and Egipt. This is all moſt gracious Lady, whereof if you pleaſe to conceiue, and giue order for the ſame accordingly, you ſhall highly honor vs your ſubiecs, and gain to your ſelfe the famous report of ſtrangers, which is the garment that bewtifieth Princes, and gouernors of ſtates.
            Thanks noble Gentlemen, (quoth the Quéene,) for your honorable care of vs, which are not acquainted with anie ſuch matters, wherefore I beſéech you my Lord Parſinio, to kéepe them company during their ſtaie here, let my Officers attend them, and their allowance be ſuch, as may not impaire our bountiful minde, thereby to deſerue honor, (if feaſting be honorable) eſpecially let their traine be wel purueyed for, both in large allowance of vyands and lodging, for thoſe are they by whom fame will ring, being of the baſer ſort, either of honor, or diſhonor, as for their Embaſſage, we will omit the hearing, vntill God endue vs with ſome more ſtrength, and ſo farewell.
            The Nobles hauing done their duties, and gone, it may be imagined, whether the Knight departed with conſent or

no, on whom the Quéene beſtowed ſo gratious a looke, as he might well iudge of his welcome, but commaund his longer ſtay ſhe would not, to auoyd the ſuſpition of iealouſie, or that her loue ſhould be in the leaſt ſort ſuſpected, Contented with the

               ight of her beloued, after their departure, commanding the reſt of the company from her, deteining onely Guenela, betwéene them began ſome pleaſant parly, wherein, firſt the Quéene, and then Guenela, deſcanted at their pleaſure of the Knight, emitting no ieſture he vſed in his ſpéech, his perſon, and what elſe greatly delighted the Princeſſe, who would often ſay, how mannerly is my ſeruant become? yea quoth Guenela, it is hard to ſay, whether he learned the ſame of man or woman, nay on my word, quoth the Princeſſe, I dare acquit him, for any company kéeping with women, his maydenly bluſh, aſſureth me that he hath learned no courting faſhions of the Theſſalian Ladies, (Credo) quoth Guenela, and Madame ſo euer beléeue, for a good beliefe, is a ſtep to ſaluation, or by my hollydom, your chéefeſt chaplin is not ſo iuſt a man as he ought to be. Thus pleaſantly diſcourſing, we leaue them, to recount vnto you the royall entertainment of the Theſſalian nobles and their traine.
            The Lord Parſinio, to whom the Quéene had deliuered this charge as you haue heard, tooke ſuch care in performance thereof, that as he was noble, and euery way endued with honorable conditions, ſo was his care, in diſcharge of that truſt committed vnto him, as the nobles admyred their royal cheare, their diuerſitie of ſports to beguile time, with coſtly ſhowes, each accident ſo exquiſitely performed, as the thoughts and imaginations thereof, mo

As theſe Nobles conſumed their time with pleaſure, which made it ſéeme the ſhorter, ſo the Queene

which had care for receiuing their meſſuage, after the firſt fight of her ſeruant, began ſo to comfort her ſelfe, that with thoſe comfortable confections her Doctors prouided, and receiuing ſuch vyands as phiſicke thought moſt méeteſt, ſhée beganne to recouer her decaied colour, and her faint limbs ouer weake with forbearing ſuch ſuſtenance, wherewith nature ſhould be reléeued, recouered their ſtrength in ſuch wiſe, as it ioyed her ſubiects to heare of her recouery.
            Time which ouercommeth mightie things, hath brought the Quéene to that good eſtate, as finding a day wherein the Sunnes power, vanquiſhed the ayres rumaticke coldneſſe, the walked into the gardaine, where ſhée ſolaced her ſelfe, beholding Natures abiliments, which beautified the earth in ſuch manner, that the pleaſantneſſe thereof, with the ſwéete ſmelles, bredde her great content. The Mayden Knight, which had deſire to ſhewe his dutie in attending her royall highneſſe, hearing this happie tydings, haſteneth to the gardaine, whome the Quéene no ſooner ſawe, but calling him vnto her, after his dutie done, and her Maieſtie taking him vp from the grounde from off his knée, ſhe ſaid;
            My Lord, what excuſe can you frame now, for neglecting your dutie to your miſtreſſe, which cannot haue your ſight being in Court, without a meſſenger, if the ſight of any one attending vs, be offenſiue vnto your Grace, wée will remoue them, rather then looſe your company, ſo wée may know them.
            Noble Princeſſe, anſwered the Knight, that I acknowledge not my dutie as I ought, pardon me, and weigh in the ballance of your gracious clemencie, my zeale and hartie deſire to doo you ſeruice: who albeit my heart deſireth no ſuch happineſſe as your Princely preſence, yet knowing that Princes haue many eyes to behold them, and Enuy lurketh in the hearts of ſubiects, who imagining more, then is on either of our parts thought, may with their euil ſpéech raiſe that ſcandall, as may blemiſh your renowne

being a virgine, and procure my greater trouble which am a ſtraunger.
            Clenly excuſed quoth the Quéene, I ſée now good ſeruant, you haue not ſpent your time idlely abroad, if I might know your ſchoole miſtreſſe, I would be ſo bold to thanke her, for the diligent applying her ſcholler.
            Madame quoth the Prince, I am glad to heare your grace ſo well diſpoſed, I hope your Maieſtie, hauing recouered ſtrength, and your buſineſſe with theſe nobles ouer paſt, will thinke of your ſeruant, and remember your word to me, which chalengeth the ſame at your maieſties hands.
            My Lord, quoth ſhe, had I not held thy loue in regard, I could not haue denied the many ſutes of my Pheres and Commons, which haue beſought me, and with great earneſtneſſe entreated me to marriage, but ſo deare hath thy loue bene vnto me, that I deſired death, rather then falſifie my faith to your grace, for whom, and through whoſe vnkindneſſe, I haue endured much hearts diſcontent.
            No more of that quoth the Knight, good Madame, expel from your minde paſſed griefes, and thinke vpon the enſuing pleaſures which wil excéed all the diſcontent hath bene: to heare your diſcontent, is litle pleaſing vnto me, who neuer cloſed theſe eyes, nor neuer beheld the riſing of the glorious Sun, without millions of times remembring your grace, whoſe preſence I more deſired then I will explaine. Guenela ſéeing ſome of the Councell entering the Gardaine, gaue them intelligence thereof, breaking off their ſpéech thus.
            Sir, if you haue taken orders in holy Church ſince your departure, it is more then is expected of all the court, which in time paſt haue ſhewed your ſelfe ſo worthily in Armes, to your laſting honor. If you haue, and her grace haue choſen you for her ghoſtly father, enioyne I beſeech, her maieſtie, to ſome eaſie penance, for her long ſicknes is not to endure much faſting, beſides, here is of the Councel, who hath waited to ſay ſomthing, either to the Quéene or your grace.
            
               Theſe wordes of Guenela, cauſed them ſurceaſe their talke, and with ſhewes of louing countenaunces, to giue each other the farewell. The Knight framing his talke to Guenela, who finding him alone, thus ſaid; Sir, experience of mine owne diſcontent, hath taught me, what a corifiue melancholy is, to a pleaſant minde, who in your abſence, haue endured many ſharpe wordes, yea, and oftentimes, thoſe thundering ſpéeches, lighting with blowes either on my ribbes, head, or face, (in reuenge of which,) had you bin preſent for whoſe ſake I endured them, I ſhould haue aduentured the cracking of a ſword with your grace, or greatly haue wanted of my will.

            My Lord, quoth Guenela, bluſhing with ſhame, your Lordſhip hath through my fondneſſe, taken me at aduantage, miſconſtruing my ſimple meaning, which haue eu

               r honored you: Conceale my folly in this, good my Lord, and forget it, and pardon my fond words, which haue felt many ſtripes for you.
            Nay Guenela, quoth the Knight, I may not with my honour let paſſe a matter of ſuch importance, without reuealing it to her highneſſe, leaſt your words (as you ſay) ſpoken in ieaſt, turne ſome of our Ladies in earneſt, to be beholding to mother Midwife.
            The Quéene which had repoſed her ſelfe, with beholding the bewtie of nature, and taken ye pleaſant aire which did greatly comfort her, hauing ſome conference with her

nobles, departed the gardein, which made the reſt withall the ſpéed they could make, to follow, whereof Guenela was nothing ſorowfull, who was thereby compeld to leaue the Knight, of whome ſhee wiſhed long before to haue ſhift her hands.
            The Quéene gathering ſome ſtrength, was loath to detaine the ſtraunge Nobles longer from her Preſence, wherefore by her Nobles ſhee limitted a time to heare them, againſt which day, was all her nobles ſummoned to be at Court, with her Ladies and women of account to attend her Maieſtie, who with the Lorde Stewarde of her houſhold, had taken ſuch order for all diuerſitie of vyandes that might be prouided. The day appointed come, not vnexſpected of the ſtraungers, who prouided themſelues as ſumptuous as they could, apparrelled after their countrey maner, attended the time of her Maieſties comming forth, who being come, and in her Chaire of Eſtate ſet, word was brought vnto the ſtraungers, who marching with the nobles of Thrace through the Court, was in moſt honourable maner preſented vnto her Maieſtie, who with countenance debonaire, and grace magiſticall, as became her royaltie, bad them all welcome, in ſuch curteous and Princely manner, that the ſtraungers at this firſt fight were driuen to great admiration, beholding that grace and honor in a woman, which they would neuer haue beléeued, had not their eyes bene witneſſes. The Quéen hauing giuen them theſe hononorable welcomes, each man taking his place, Ormania, the chéefeſt in Commiſſion from their King, thus ſaid;
            Magnificent Prince, our King, your highneſſe late ſubiect, acknowledging his humble dutie to your Exellence, hath ſent vs his liegemen and ſworne ſeruants, to ſignifie the ſame, who in faithfull loue voweth, neuer to be allienated in minde from that dutie, which becommeth each naturall ſubiect to owe his Prince and country. By vs he preſents his offer of ſeruice, which ſhall be with all his power ready, at your highneſſe pleaſure: the reſt his honourable

Letters ſhal import, which humbly kiſſing, on their knées they deliuered into her Princely handes, who returned many thanks to their King for his loue, with lyke to them, which had vouchſafed that trauaile; to ſée her Court and Preſence, beſéeching them to take in worth a maydens entertainment, in doing which, ſhée ſhould thinke her ſelfe much beholding vnto them.
            With pleaſant parley, and diſcourſing of ſundry matters and queſtions by the Quéene propounded, touching their Countries, they paſſed the time vntill dinner, not without great admiration of the ſtraungers, which beheld her ſtately grace, her ſumptuous attire, the dutie and honour done by her nobles and Ladies, which with their coſtly apparrell and rare exellence in bewtie, greatly delighted them. The time of dinner drawing neare, the tables couered, and all things prepared for the ſame, the Quéene taking her place, the Embaſſadors were likewiſe placed at another table in her preſence. The maner of her ſeruice, with the diuerſitie of vyands of all ſorts, was ſuch, as they could hardly beléeue, ſo many ſundry kindes of ſowle, fiſh, and other, chéere for them prepared, were to be found in the limits of the earth. Thus with wonderfull delight, cheared ſtill by her highneſſe, they paſſed the time vntil the end of dinner, neuer forgetting the maieſtie of her grace, which ſo honorably bare her, as no Prince could in her time compare with her. Dinner ended, the Quéene curteouſly bidding thoſe ſtrangers welcome, ſhée was conducted by her Nobles into a Gallery, which for bewtifull ſhowes with rare pictures, and deuiſes of rich price, was ſo adorned, as the ſtrangers had neuer ſéene the lyke. Not long had they paſſed the time in noting thoſe glorious deuiſes, but the Courtiers, who had prouided themſelues to doo her highneſſe honor, and cauſe her delight, which had ſo long time withdrawne her ſelf from all pleaſures, armed in al parts, with each man his ſeueral deuiſe, they entered the yard, appointed of cuſtome for the Tilt, where a window opening

from the gallery, the Quéene with the ſtrangers were ſet to behold thoſe paſtimes. The whole company come, each one for honor of hir grace, deliuered his Scuchion of deuiſe, vnto her Princely hands. Where Gentiles ſuppoſe you, that know Ladies praiſes, or diſpraiſes, what happened. Where to beguile the time, was each deuiſe by the Quéen and her Ladies, ſurueyed with ſuch vigilant eyes, as nothing was vnremembred, euery one giuing their iudgement according to that affection they beare the preſenter. While they were thus deſcānting, and the Marſhall with the Iudges, appointing each man in his degrée to try himſelfe, behold, a prettie Page, mounted on a light running Courſer, with his guide before him, winding his horne in poaſting manner, comming neare the place where y• quéene was, lighted from his horſe, and being not of heigth anſwerable, to deliuer his Letters with his hand, putting them on his wande, (after his dutie done) humbly kiſſing them, he deliuered them vnto her maieſties hand, which y• quéene peruſing, queſtioned the Page if he had ought elſe to impart? Who anſwered, Moſt famous Prince, my Lord and maiſter, hearing of this aſſembly which fame hath bruted, to the honor of this royall company, and high commendations of theſe nobles, hath ſent, as not daring to approach the place without their lawfull fauour obteined, who for honor of his miſtreſſe, which he affirmeth, and will maintaine, to be the moſt exquiſit Lady for all perfections in the confines of the earth, he offereth at the Tilt, with each gain-ſayer, to breake ſixe ſtaues. If there be any ſuch that will accept his challenge in mainteining his miſtreſſe honour, let mée know him, who ſhall ſoone be anſwered. The Page being vnknowne, the nobles wondred what he might be, which without exception had made this chalenge, imagining that he was ſome man of valour, and y• it were diſcurteſie to deny a man at armes whatſoeuer. Theron generally concluding, they returned him by the Page, this anſwere.
            Page, though thy maſters peremptory chalenge, deſerue

rather to be maligned, then accepted, yet ſuch is the nobilitie of Thrace, as honouring Armes, and all profeſſors therof, accept the ſame, and where we had appointed euery one his companion, we are content to remit that election, and to bind all our force to his diſhonor, and ſo to him vnknowne, commend vs, whom we intreat to Arme ſodeinly, and ſpéed him hither. The Page receiuing his anſwer of the nobles, the Quéene calling him which mounted was ready to depart, ſaid;
            Sir Boy, to thy vnknowne Knight commend vs, whom we thanke, for vouchſauing vs that honor his Letters import, which our nobilitie haue without any ſute of mine accepted, of whom he ſhal finde men endowed with courage. The Page departed, ſundry were the imaginations what the Knight might be, who had offered them this proud chalendge, in midſt whereof, a trumpet ſounding, they expected the challenger, who entered armed in all partes, with blacke armour, which was garniſht with many wounded harts, on the breſt, a Lady with a cloth of fine lawne whipping them, ouerſpreading as many as ſhe could reach with a ſcarfe, carnation coloured, his word (in Greeke) diſpaire not,) pacing on with eaſie paces, according to the vſe of the place, comming neare that ende of the Tilt which was oppoſite with the Quéenes window, vayling his head to her Maieſtie, ſhée graciouſly hadde him welcome, ſhaking her hand. Long had he not ſtaid, but the Lord Marſhall in lyke maner, with ſhow of great curteſie bad him welcome, and deſired him to prepare himſelfe, for the defendants attended him. My Lord, quoth the Knight, at their good pleaſures, when they ſhal put themſelues forward at the trumpets ſound, I wil méete them. Thus warning giuen them, without longer ſtay, the Lord Vrelia, his copartner in Theſſaly, ſet forward, whom the Mayden Knight met with ſuch force, as his féete were too big for his ſtirropes, and he likely to haue taken a more diſgrace being vnhorſed. This firſt encounter was noted of all the nobles, who commended his

ſtrength regarded him nothing, but with ſuch valour met him, that he made him to his great diſgrace, forſake the ſaddell, at which a generall ſhowt to the Knights great commendations was giuen. The Lord Vrelia hauing had his part, another came in place, who went not away without ſome diſgrace, ſo generally behaued he himſelfe, and with ſuch honour and valour bare him, that the Iudges, fathers of Armes, gaue the honor of the day to him, whom they all, though a ſtranger, highly commended. The Knight comming before the Quéen, humbly doing his dutie, was with his Trumpet ſounding ready to depart, whom the nobles would not ſuffer, without his knowledge, beſéeching him, not ſo much to diſhonor them, of whome he had deſerued honor, in ſuch maner to leaue them. The Mayden Knight, who would as willingly haue reuealed himſelfe, as they deſired, though he made ſhow of ſome diſcontent, yet wold not deny their requeſt, but calling for his Armourer, opened his Beauer, who béeing knowne to be the Mayden Knight, they were all the more honored, taking no diſgrace to be foyled of him, by whoſe hands ſo many had loſt their liues, which were honorable and expert in Armes. Being diſcouered, he preſented himſelfe to her maieſtie, who not a litle ioyfull of her ſeruants good fortune, whom the graced in this maner. Seruant quoth ſhe, thanks for your paines, and honoring vs at this time, for which I enſure you, I thinke my ſelfe much beholding, it had bene pittie, truantlike you ſhuld haue left theſe honorable Lords your frends without hauing acknowledged your ſelfe vnto vs & them, who you ſhall ſée, will be carefull to procure a Surgion, who doubtleſſe ſhall cure thoſe bleeding hearts, if any ſuch there be ofſkill in Thrace. Honored Lady, quoth the knight, the well ſpring of curteſie & nobilitie, moſt humble thanks I yéeld your maieſtie, for this grace, without whoſe fauour and grace, to whom in dutie I am ſo bounden, I deſire not life. This ſaid, the Quéene and the ſtraunge nobles departing, ſupper being readie and they ſet, their table talke was

of the braue behauiour of the Knight, who had all the honor attributed to him, that was to be required, wherin the ſtrangers were ioyed, louing him dearly, and to encreaſe the fame which generally was giuen him, they in preſence of the whole aſſembly, declared the honors her maieſties Champion had gained in Theſſaly and Egipt, with the death of their King, who of a wound by his hand at the Tilt, dyed: leauing nothing vnſpoken which might any way honor him, whereof the Quéene ioyed not a litle, though ſhée concealed the ſame.
            Supper ended, and ſome part of the night ſpent in dauncing, maſking, and other Courtlike paſtimes, the Quéene commending the nobles to their reſtes, bad the company good night, who entering her lodging, it might haue ioyed the heart of any Lady in loue, to heare the generall laude of the Ladies, giuen to the Mayden Knight, of whom no other talke was to be heard, each honourable part in him commended to his deſert, and of his valour in Armes, no praiſe was ſufficient: wherewith the Quéene was not a litle pleaſed, nor Guenela diſcontent, to heare the onely Prize of honour giuen her Lord, by whome ſhée had hope for her paſſed ſeruice, to bee preferred. Thus ioying on all parts, wée leaue the Quéene with her company to their reſts, and returne to the Nobles ſtraungers, whoſe commendations and honorable reports of the Knight was ſuch, that nothing could be more pleaſing vnto them, applauding the wiſedome and noble demeanour of the Quéene, whoſe lyke in her time, was not as they ſuppoſed to bee found: with ſuch ſundry diſcourſes, paſſed theſe Nobles the night, to which wée leaue them for a time. Theſe Princely paſtimes ouerpaſt, the care of the Quéene was for diſpatch of the Nobles of Theſſaly, whom ſhe was loth to detaine from that deſire they had to ſée their Countrey. Wherefore, after ſome two or thrée dayes ſpent in diſcourſing of their countries, and ſtate of their realmes, with the commodities therof, eftſoones enterlacing their diſcourſes,

with ſome pleaſant parley, wherein the Nobles were much delighted, the Quéene tooke order with her Councell for their anſwere, limitting a time therefore, to the good content of the ſtrangers. Againſt which prefixed time, the Quéene hauing care of her honorable word, had their Letters all written and ſigned, when omitting them to a banquet, ſhée in ſuch honourable manner deliuered their anſwere, with ſuch words of loue, and deſire of good to their King, as ouercome with ioyes thereof, the ſtrangers were not able long time to anſwere, preſenting their King and Quéene with gifts of high eſtéeme, and highly rewarding their honourable pains, which they gratefully accepted, taking order for Gallies with victualls, and other neceſſaries to be purueyed with ſpéed and beuntie.
            This honourable entertainment of the Quéene to thoſe ſtraungers, being in the prime of her gouernment, gained her ſuch honour through their reportes, that thoſe which heard the ſame, admired her, whom they imagined was péerleſſe, for wiſedome, bountie, and curteſie, not omitting the fauour and loue of the Nobilitie, of whoſe worthineſſe, they could neuer ſpeake ſufficient.
            As time finiſheth the greateſt affaires, ſo the carefull trauaile of thoſe to whome the prouiſion of the Fléet was commended, was ſuch, that there was no wants in ſhort time left vnfurniſhed, that lacking nothing but a faire winde, which hée that commaundeth winde and ſeas, ſent in ſuch happie time, as they could with, which not willing to looſe, they commend the health and happie gouernment of the Quéene, to him that ruleth all. And ſo accompanied with the Mayden Knight, who was loath to leaue them, and many other Phéeres of the lande, they were conducted each one to his ſeuerall Gally, where being imbarqued, their Sayles cut, and they affore the winde, they gaue their farewell, with ſuch a braue ringing peale of great Cannons, and then likewiſe their ſmall Artillery, as wonderfully reioyced the beholders, which by the

Gunners from the Quéenes Forts a ſhore, was as worthily anſwered. Thus parted theſe nobles, who in ſhort time arriued in ſafetie in Egipt, with their King, vnto whome, hauing deliuered the Princes Preſents with their letters, they omitted no reports of their honorable entertainment of the Quéene and her nobles, in ſuch maner, that where they or any of their traine long time after became, their table talke, was onely of their honorable welcoms in Thrace, euer applauding the magnificent grace, wiſedome & bountie of the Quéene, whome they gaue the Prize vnto, of all that liued in her time, leauing nothing vnremembred, which might any way impaire the honourable reputation of her nobles, which vſed them with al the curteſie & bountie becomming their eſtates: but eſpecially the Mayden Knight, the diſcourſe of whoſe valour and maner of behauiour, bred more delight then the reſt, for that the nobles and commons had knowledge of his valour and worthineſſe. Theſe honorable commendations of the nobles, ioyed the King, who in his ſecret thoughts applauded her highneſſe fauour and curteſie, that for his ſake and honour, had vſed thoſe his ſubiects in all Princely manner. But amongſt thoſe which tooke pleaſure in hearing thoſe diſcourſes of the nobles, the Quéene enflamed with their reports, burned with deſire to ſée this péerleſſe Princeſſe, as the ſecond part of this hiſtorie ſhall ſhew you. Till when, leauing the King with his Phéers to their ſolace, return we to Thrace, Where the Knight imboldned by the fauour of his gracious Lady, was not ſo great a ſtranger with her highneſſe, but that he might at pleaſure repaire to her preſence, with whom by his earneſt ſute, and deſire to be poſſeſſed of her whom he ſo much loued and honoured, he egged her on ſtill to marry, which for ſhe would not do, without a generall conſent of her nobles and ſtates of the realme, ſhe cauſed a Parliament tobe ſommoned, at which time, finding her fit opportunitie, ſhe imparted her determinations in this maner.
            
               Honourable Lordes, and you our louing Commons here aſſembled, let not thoſe fewe words I haue to ſay vnto you, bréede any diſcontent, that will deliuer nothing diſhonorable to my ſtate, and your diſparagement: to withhold you from the ſame long, were more niceneſſe then wiſdom, wherefore briefly thus.
            Sithence I was by permiſſion of him that exalteth and pulleth downe Princeſſe, at his will, I am by your honourable & generall conſents, Crowned Quéen of this realme, to whoſe gouernment you haue as lawfully deſcended from him whom you al loued and feared, committed your ſelues, ſithence which, you haue all with ſhows of honorable loue, and care of our ſtate and realmes, by ſundry examples perſwaded me to marriage, which you ſay, may bréede your happineſſe, whoſe good, he that ſearcheth my harts ſecrets, knoweth that I more preferre then my life, on whoſe ſutes ſo often made, I haue aduiſedly conſidered, and noting the many perils incident to our ſexe, which rather require to be gouerned, then to gouerne, the name of King being feared, honored and loued, through feare, when they hold our ſexe in contempt. All which conſidered, with your former ſutes, if I grant to your requeſt, I doubt not, but I ſhall find that fauour, which the pooreſt of my ſubiects haue, fréely to chooſe, where their loues and likings leadeth them, which if you grant, I ſhall hold my loue well beſtowed on you, and ſhall haue cauſe to thinke your requeſt in times paſt hath bene honorable, and not to tye me to any inconuenience, aſſuring you, that whateuer he be that I ſhall bend my liking vnto, ſhall not diſparage my eſtate, nor diſhonor you, but be worthie for wiſedome, valour, and what elſe is required in honorable perſons, to mate the Princeſſe of moſt renowne on the earth. You haue heard what I haue to ſay, and wherefore chiefly this Parliament was ſommoned, of which I craue your anſweres.
            The Nobles and Lords, both ſpirituall and temporall, with the Commons of both houſes, hearing the Quéenes

motion, were all mute, not knowing ſodeinly in a matter of ſuch waight, what to anſwere. But remooued from their dumps, the Speaker being both wiſe and well demeaned, as befitted his place, humbly proſtrating himſelfe, thus ſaid;
            Moſt gracious Princeſie, albeit your Maieſties requeſt to this honourable Houſe, is no more then wée haue earneſtly ſought, yet pardon our ſodaine anſwere, and giue vs reſpite of time vntill to morrow, the remaine of this day, ſo it ſtande with your Princely fauoure, ſhall be ſpent to heare the cenſure of all eſtates in theſe Preſence, whoſe loue and dutie is ſuch, as they will deny nothing, wherein your royall and honourable eſtate is not diſparaged, but in all thinges, will with all humbleneſſe ſubiect themſelues to your highneſſe pleaſure.
            The Quéene loath to require ſuch haſte in anſwering her queſtion, graciouſly commanded him to riſe, graunting moſt willingly to his demaunds, for which the whole aſſembly with a vniall voyce, gaue her Grace moſt humble thankes.
            The Quéene hauing deliuered the ſumme of her deſire, graciouſly commending them to his will that frameth all things, accompanied with many of Phéeres, departeth.
            The Quéene departed, all matters in queſtions laid apart, the Phéeres and moſt chéefeſt of both Houſes, aſſembled themſelues in Councell, where you muſt ſuppoſe, no matter for benefit of the ſtate, was omitted. The requeſt made by their Quéene, with great aduice conſidered, which amongſt them was admired, where many imaginations aſſailed them, deuiſing of each ſide, what he ſhould be that is in ſo highe eſtéeme and fauour with her Grace, and of ſuche worthie reputation as ſhée hath reported him, eftſoones naming one, then ſome other, yet the principall obiect of her loue neuer remembred, which draue them all to an non plus.
            
            But what euer hée were, time of their owne deſire to anſwere,

craued ſome diſpatch of what they had in queſtion. Wherefore leauing friuolous queſtions, they procéede to their begunne action, gladly would they haue bene certified of their elected King, but in vaine it was for them to require it. Wherefore conſidering their owne deſires, they thought it would be taken in euill part of her highneſſe, to gainſay what with ſuch humble and earneſt ſutes they had required, aſſuring themſelues of her wiſedome, gouernment, and care of their goods, which was ſo wiſe, and euery way ſo honourably demeaned, which conſidered, thereuppon relying, it was generally determined, to referre all to her owne will, pleaſure, and good lyking. On which reſolued, the chéefeſt of the Nobilitie, accompanied with diuerſe of the Cleargy, in hope of the Quéens good acceptance, ſpéedeth them to the Court, who ſodeinly was aduertiſed of their being, with their requeſt, which was, to haue acceſſe to her highneſſe. No ſooner was her highneſſe therof certified, but leauing her Chamber where ſhe was buſily imployed about thoſe buſineſſes which ſhée had in hand, deuiſing of the anſwere of the Commons, leauing all, ſhée ſpéedeth her vnto them, where taking her place, their duties in all humbleneſſe done, and ſhée with all honourable curteſie requited it, the Speaker in preſence of the whole aſſembly, thus ſaid;
            Dread Soueraign, the Lords both ſpirituall and temporall, with commons in this honourable Parliament aſſembled, weying with care and wiſdom, the honor of your highneſſe, and carefully tendering the weale publike, haue with great care of both, (the premiſes) conſidered, with your maieſties requeſt, albeit, they haue no knowledge of his honorable perſon, vnto whom your royall liking is vnited, yet relying on your Princely wiſedome, and care of your ſubiects, by whoſe welfare their happineſſe is to be mainteined, with one vniall conſent, they willingly ſubiect themſelues vnto your highneſſe will and pleaſure, aſſuring your

grace, that whom you ſhall vouchſafe to endue with tytle of Lord and huſband, they will accept for their ſoueraigne, and will in all humbleneſſe, acknowledge with louing hearts their duties vnto him, as to their lawfull King, by your maieſties election. Thus my gracious Lady, haue they willed me to ſay, in behalfe of them all, and moſt humbly beſéech your highneſſe, to make knowne vnto them the name ſo honored, which you haue vouchſafed to like, to the end they neglect not that dutie which is due vnto him by your good grace.
            The Quéene hearing this anſwere of her Commons, was more ioyed, and in heart contented, then euer ſhe was ſince the death of her father, her louing countenance ſhewing the content of her heart, ſo long diſcontent, which made her, with moſt louely grace and curteſie, to ſay;
            My Lords all, and you of the Communaltie, you haue in yéelding to theſe honorable motions by me made, highly contented her, whoſe deſire in loue, made me not ſo headſtrong to conſent without your generall lyking, my choiſe being ſuch, as may be mated with the onelieſt Lady of higheſt eſtéeme in the worlde, as I doubt not your ſelues will confeſſe, when he ſhalbe knowne vnto you, my high eſtéeme of him laid apart, for that you may ſay, affection is blinde. And as the Prouerb ſaith, The Negro by nature, black and loathſome in our eyes, eſtéemes her Infant faire, ſo Loue, which commandeth all creatures, cauſed many Princes and Ladies of worth, to ſubmit themſelues to baſe eſtates, Imperious loue ſo ouer maſtering their hearts, to aſſure you that my lyking is not ſuch, and to ſatiſfie you, which with your curteous conſent hath contented me, know your ſo elected ſouaraigne, and he that I haue ſubiected my loue vnto, is of no leſſe worth then a Prince, royally borne, and deſcended from the loynes of a King famous, and a Quéene endowed with much honor, himſelfe ſhewing his royall deſent by his demeanour, which is valiant, wiſe, and curteous, ſuch a one, I know your deſires is to chuſe for your

ſoueraigne: all offection ſet apart, ſuch a one haue I choſen, which ſhal cauſe al your ioies, if you ioy in any good. Where breaking off your ſpéech, with other words of curteſie, yéelding them great thankes, ſhe called Guenela, whome ſhée commanded, to ſend ſome truſtie meſſenger for the Prince, willing him, all buſineſſe ſet apart, to repaire vnto her, which done, framing pleaſant diſcourſes which delighted the nobles, ſhe ſought to their contents, to beguile the time vntill the meſſenger returned, which made ſuch haſte, that he found the Knight, vnto whom he imparted the Quéens pleaſure, which albeit, the ſodeineſſe thereof, was troubleſome vnto him, cloying his head, deuiſing of ſundry matters, which her haſtie ſending for him ſhould import, yet neglecting no time, he ſpéedeth him to the Preſence, where to the Quéene he was the welcommeſt man liuing, as her countenance declared; who calling him vnto her, commanded a chair to be brought, and ſeating him on her left hand, to the admiration of all the beholders, which done ſhe ſaid;
            My Lords, and you our louing ſubiects, muſe not at this vnwoonted fauour vſed to this Gentleman, nor repine not, for that it is your owne choyſe. This is my choyſe, and hée that I haue ſworne my loue and loyall affection vnto, who albeit hath thus long ſubiected himſelfe to our ſeruice, dooing vs many high fauours, as your owne eyes can witneſſe, enduced vnto it by that high commander of men, who hath procured many Princes to the lyke: for our loue, as I am aſſured, he abandoned his Kingly ſeate, diſguiſed in the baſe attire of a Merchant, came to our Court, where what honors he hath gained by his valour and curteſie, not one of you but know Numedia, being his natiue ſoyle, and the kingdome his by lawfull deſent from the King his father. Let it not diſmay you my friends, nor iudge my words ſpoken of him for his honor, to be more then truth, ſo ſhall you wrong him whoſe woorth you may be by my reports aſſured off, and iniury her which had neuer intent, but to deſerue well of you all. Therefore as you haue your deſire

knowing him, in token of your loue and generall conſents, by whom hée is your adopted King, ſhewe by your ſignes of content, howe pleaſing my choyce and lyking is vnto you.
            The Nobles amazed at the Quéenes ſpéech, although they could hardly be enduced to beléeue what ſhée had ſayd, yet ſuch was the loue they honored her with, that giuing credit vnto her words, without longer pauſe of the matter, that the Quéene might the rather be wonne to credit their former ſpéech, with a vniuerſall voyce, proſtrating themſelues before him, they cryed, God ſaue the King & Quéene, vowing vnto him loyaltie and failtie, as vnto their King and ſoueraigne.
            Thanks good my Lords, quoth the Prince, for your good conſents, and doubt not of my loue to you, which with ſuch heartie affection ſhall be ſhewed, that my deareſt bloud ſhal be ſhead, ere the leaſt haire of the baſeſt of your heads ſhall periſh. Which ſaid, the Quéene ſtanding vp, requeſted the Nobles, that as they had with conſent elected him their King, ſo they would appoynt the time for ſolemnizing the marriage with the Coronation, chaunging his name from Pheander the Mayden Knight, to Dionicus, the lawful heire of the Numedian Crowne, for that was his right, and the name of Pheander, but vſurped.
            Which requeſt of her Maieſtie, they eaſily granted, appoynting the marriage thrée dayes following, and the Coronation preſently to follow, which to their great ioyes was accompliſhed, with all the honour might be done by their ſubiects, the coſtly ſhowes, and all maner of delightfull paſtimes there vſed, I omit, albeit it was pleaſing both to their King and Quéene, and brought great ioy and comfort to all beholders. The marriage with the Coronation paſt, the Commons delighted with their King, aſſured his grace, to be ſo honorable as the Quéene had reported him, and they found, who in that Parlament to honor the Thracians the more, and let them know, his loue was no whit

inferiour to theirs, he entailed the Crowne of Numedia, to the lawfull heire of Thrace, ſuccéeding, aſſuring them, that his Nobles and Commons, ſhould confirme and aſſure the ſame.
            Which curteous fauour, the Nobles ſo gratefully accepted, as they returned him for the ſame, many gracious thanks, the Parliament proroged, according to cuſtome of the Country, their dutie in all humbleneſſe done, the Nobles, with the chéefeſt of all parts in the land, wiſhed the Quéene and King many happy dayes, to their ioy and harts content: which they requited with ſuch ſhewes of loue as might delight them, and giue them cauſe to ioy in their Princes election, of whom their comfort was great, & their aſſurance of tranquillitie with forraine Princes, through his magnanimitie, to be ſuch, as al true ſubiects might haue pleaſure to recount. Their leaue taken, euery one departs well content, to his home.
            Thus the King and Quéene, enioying hearts content, their loues more and more encreaſed, that there was no talks but of their faithfull loue and hearts lyking, through which, the Commons liued in peace, praying for their long liues to be continued. To which content in loue, the ſtory leaueth them, recounting the arriuall of the aged Barnardine, in Thrace, who with his long trauaile came vnto the Court, where wandering Pilgrimelike, liuing by the deuotion of bountifull people, he ſpent ſome time in contemplation, others in viewing the bewtie of the Court, and maners of the people, eftſoones commending their religion, and ſeruing their creature, taking much pleaſure in diſcourſing with ſuch Pilgrime ſtrangers as he méete, of the diuerſe conditions of thoſe Nations, whoſe Countries hée had ſéene, which being many, he affected no Princes Region, as this Country of Thrace.
            
            
               The aged father ouer worne with griefe and long trauell, was ſo much altered in his face, as he that had wel known him, might very well haue miſtaken his feature, which made the King, who oftentimes had noted his comely perſon, his Pilgrimes attire and other ornaments, to religious belonging, greatly to affect him, litle ſuſpecting it was the aged Barnardine. But as time reuealeth greateſt ſecrets, and bringeth friends to knowledge, ſo the King taking pleaſure, beholding this Pilgrime, noted him ſo often, that his phiſiognemy to his memory, preſented the feature of his beloued Barnardine, which imagined thought, began to take ſuch roote in the King, as he greatly deſired to haue ſome conference with the Pilgrime, euermore perſwading himſelfe that it was his noble Tutor, and carefull Phiſition. To aſſure him of that doubt, he determined to haue knowledge of the aged man if he might, and for that intent, cauſed his Pages to giue diligent héed, if they ſawe him in the Court, to bring him tydings thereof, which they did according to his Maieſties commandement, attending with ſuch care, at that vſuall time he was accuſtomed to come, that he paſſed not of them vnperceiued, whereof they gaue the King intelligence, by whoſe commaund, hée was ſommoned to his Preſence.
            The aged Pilgrime at this firſt ſomance of the meſſenger, was in ſuch dread of wrong to be offered him, as hée greatly feared ſome ill to betide him, knowing that Princes haue many eyes, and ſtrangers are markes, how poore ſo euer their eſtates are, ſpecially frequenting the Court as he did, yet he whoſe conſcience could not accuſe him of any euill intent againſt the King, had this hope, that God whom he ſerued, doth protect the innocent, and would deliuer him. Thus caſting his care on him that commandeth Kings, not without many imaginations what ſhould be the cauſe he came vnto the Kings Preſence, vnto whom, as one that knew his good, he proſtrated himſelfe, praying hartily for the Kings proſperitie.
            
               The King which ſaw the old man bowing before him, kindly tooke him from the ground, tendring his age, which he honored, whom the more he noted, the more the louely face of his beloued Barnardine, preſents it vnto his memory, the thought of whom, cauſed his heart to much ſorrow, yet ſhaking off griefe, of father, kingdome, and friend, he ſayd; Aged father, in whoſe face appeareth grauitie, tel me, of that dutifull loue thou oweſt thy moſt beloued friend, of what Countrey thou art? and what fortunes hath brought thée to this region? that honoring thée, whoſe age requireth the ſame, I may further thy ſutes if thou haue any, or wanting wealth, I may leléeue thée. The wofull Pilgrime, reuiued by thoſe honorable ſpéeches of the King, ſayd;
            Renowmed Prince, the mirror of honor, of whoſe fame the world is filled, to ſatiſfie your Exellence, know, that occaſions of importance thereunto mouing me, I forſooke my natiue Countrey, in ſearch of thoſe whom my fortune was neuer yet to méete, yet haue I trauelled many kingdomes, and in my trauell, haue ſéene many Princes Courts, and noted their ſeuerall demeanors, yet moſte gracious ſoueraigne, neuer tooke I pleaſure in any, as in this Countrey of Thrace, the nobles eſpecially giuing me cauſe to admire them whoſe minds ſhew their true Gentilitie, as the frute maketh the tree knowne, in which taking delight, I haue, though more then beſeemeth a ſtranger, ſo often frequented thy Court, wherewith, if your grace take any offence, I humbly beſéech your pardon, which am now readie to depart.
            The King, which had heard that tongue ſo often reade him many Lectures, and giuen him inſtructions of honor, was not deceiued him, though albeit he forbear to acknowknowledge him, whom he deſired ſo hartily to ſée, vnto whom he was more welcom then any man liuing, yet concealing himſelfe, he ſaid;
            Father, thanks for thy loue, and honorable report of our realme and people, for which I reſt thy debter. But ſay me,

aged man, of what Countrey art thou? and what account were thoſe friends with thée, whom thou with ſuch trauell haſt ſought? whether thyallies, or thy friends by adoption. At this motion of the King, the old man ouercome with the thoughts of thoſe of whom his pittifull tale was to be told, could not forbeare teares, which with ſuch aboundance of ſobbes and heauy ſighes were vttered, that it moued the King to great ruth, ſéeing thoſe ſiluer haires which he honored, bedeawed with ſault droppes, the witneſſe of his his diſcontent. Wherefore like the carefull Phiſitian, hauing miniſtred bitter Pilles to his Pacient, ſeaſoneth the ſame with ſome ſwéeter taſt, he comforteth ye aged Barnardine, with words ſo pleaſing, that it cheared the old man, yet would not pardon his report, which cauſed him ſay;
            Famous King, if pittie of my age may any way mooue you, vrge not my faltering tongue to vtter a tale of ſuche ruth as it importeth, the remembrance whereof, ouercloyeth me with ſorrow, and will bring your Exellence ſmall delight. Therefore ſoueraigne Prince, pardon me, which cannot reueale the truth of ſo pittifull a tale, (as yet) without the hazard of my life, my heart ſo ouercharged with griefe, that to thinke thereon, halleth me neare to death, then pardon me. But how loath ſo euer, the King might not be entreated, whom with ſuch pleaſing ſpéech he halled on, that comforted by his maieſties kind words whom he would not gainſay, he ſayd, ſithence nothing may perſwade your Exellence to pittie mée, accept in woorth my rudeneſſe, and pardon it. Which ſayd, humbly doing his dutie, as one that could his good, he thus procéeded.
            Dread Lord, know Numedia is my natiue ſoyle, where through the grace of my thriſe noble Prince, I conſumed my youth in that happineſſe, fauoured by his fauour, with the beſt of account in that Region, & ſo graced by the King, that he committed y• gouernment of his deare ſonne, more deare to him then his life, to be trained vp by me, of whom, as dutie willed me, I had that care as is required of a ſubiect

to his Lord, ioying in nothing the world poſſeſſeth, ſo much, as in the towardneſſe of the Prince, whoſe verteous youth, might be a loadſtarre to all that euer I ſaw, for curteſie matchleſſe, bountifull as Tymon, more valiant then Hector, or the beſt deſeruing y• liued, cunning was he in the liberall Artes, what ſhould I ſay of him whoſe honourable praiſe, no tongue can with ſuch commendations vtter, as his honors and vertues requireth, ſo generally beloued of all men, that death is more ſwéeter to many thouſandes of his ſubiects, then the remembrance of that Noble Prince. Here teares reſtrained his ſpéech, that he could not vtter a word, ſtanding ſo aſtonied, that he rather repreſented the Image of death, then a liuing creature, whom the King put from his heauy paſſion thus.
            Father, thou haſt filled my heart with a worlde of wonders at thy ſtrange talke, which I coniure thée, of that loue thou oweſt the Prince whom thou ſorroweſt ſo to remember, not to leaue in ſuch abrupt maner, but procéed, dyed the King, and the Prince ſo of thée honored, and through their deaths gan thy trauaile. Say ſwéete father?
            Though the reporting of this dolefull hiſtory, more gréeuous vnto me then death, ſhould finiſh my dayes, yet ſuch is the penance by your maieſties coniuring ſpéech enioyned me, that what griefe ſo euer I endure, I will ſatiſfie your grace.
            The Prince, oh my Lord, that it would pleaſe you to pardon the reſt, growing to yeares of diſcretion, I know not through what meanes, neither could I for all the diligence I vſed, attain vnto it, but ſicke he was, and ſo oppreſt with ſuch a ſtraunge agony, that no phiſicke could miniſter reléefe vnto him, or yéeld him any eaſe, ſo that there was ſmal hope of his recouery, the ſtrangeneſſe of each maledy being ſuch, as ſometime faring lyke a man frantike, no perſwaſions of reaſon night preuaile with him, who in his health was to be ruled in all things. This paſſion ſo long aſſayled the Prince, and ſo little hope of his recouerie, that

the extremitie thereof, gan touch the King and Quéen mother, whoſe carefull loue was ſuch, as nature could not require more in parence whatſoeuer. The continuall griefe of the prince, wrought ſuch care in the aged King & Quéen, that it was not to be founde which of them was moſt gréeued, or whoſe lot it was to giue his due to death, firſt, yet as no care is ſo great but hath ſome comfort, ſo the commander of men, when all hope of life, was paſt hope of men, reſtored the Prince to health, and by his health, recouered the King and Quéen, for whoſe weale, the Commons more reioyced, then of their owne good, ſo that a general ioy was throughout the realme, tryumphing at this happy recouery of the Prince, the King, and Quéene. But as the faireſt day is ouerſhadowed with cloudes, ſo was the ſunſhine of their ioy eclipſed, through the great folly of the Prince, who vnknowne of all men, or acquainting any with his pretence, left his father, Crowne, and ſubiects, and liueth no man knoweth how, or where, for whom the King felt a million of woes: griefe ſo aſſailing his aged corpes, as he was like to reſt with death, but reaſon ſubduing affection, he recouered his ſickneſſe, and leauing his land without a gouernour, likewiſe departed, whither no man knoweth. The mother Quéene being of nature weake, reſigned her due to death, whom as dutie commands me, I entombed with ſuch honor as beſéemeth the perſon of a Quéene, and ſo perſwaded with the Commons in a Parliament for the ſame intent called, as the gouernment of the Realme was committed to ſix of the nobilitie, who are bound to reſigne their authoritie when the lawful ſuccéeded ſhall require it, which done, I forſooke all I enioyed, and Pilgrime like as your highneſſe ſées, haue trauelled many Countries in ſearch of my ſoueraign the Prince, but for all the diligence I can vſe, of them can learne no tydings. Thus with teares ſtanding in his eyes, he ended his lamētable hiſtory, which the King was aſſured to be true, but leaſt was the thought of Barnardine, that he had deliuered this dolefull tale to the

Prince, which had likewiſe ſome cauſe of griefe, which ſo neare touched him, as he could not for teares vtter what he would, yet putting by his paſſions as he could he ſaid:
            Aged father, matter of great ruth haſt thou deliuered, which to heare is moſt lamentable, and may touche that careleſſe Prince neare, by whom this chance hath chanced, his parence and ſubiects: but tell me father, all griefe layd apart, in what ſtate liueth the ſubiects of thy King, vnder their gouernment which hath the charge, yet is your grace not ſatiſfied quoth the Pilgrime, but will exact on mee more to encreaſe my griefe, which ſéeing you delight in, I ſhall vnfolde that which in recounting, will finiſh all, yéelding my breath to him that gaue it mee, therefore attend.
            Not long ſithence, vnknowne, I chanced to accompany in my trauaile, a Gentleman of Numedia, to mée well knowne, which for I ſawe I was out of knowledge with him, I queſtioned him of many matters, as your grace hath done me, which amongſt other his newes of diſcontent, reported that thoſe elected gouernors, whoſe hearts broyling with ambition and deſire of the whole authoritie, as the title of King, to the ambitious is ſwéete, ſo theſe couetous wretches, taking part one with the other, ſome enclining one way, ſome to the other part, that ciuill diſcention was raiſed, where the father beare Armes againſt the ſonne, the ſonne againſt the father, and kinſman againſt kinſman, one imbruing their hands in others blood, through which, many a woman is left a widow, and many a ſwéete Infant fatherles, which makes me greatly feare, without his help, that ſendeth all help, to the helpleſſe, the land will be impoueriſhed, and our King and Prince returning, ſhall from their proper right be debarred, by theſe vſurping vilaines, whoſe hearts, my aged téeth in reuenge of their treachery, and wrong done the Commons, I could teare. The Prince hearing that tale of diſcōtent, was moued more at y• wrong offered the Commons, then all the former hiſtory, which

made his ſay;
