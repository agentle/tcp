            A TRVE DECLARAtion
of the great enterpriſe of
both the Armies vnder the conduct
of the Marqueſſe SPINOLA on the
one part, and his princely Excellency Count
MAVRICE of Naſſau on the other
party, together with the names of the

               GEntle Reader before
we come to relate
the preparation
of defence taken in
hand by the noble
Lords, the Eſtates,
vnder the conduct of
his princely Excellency.
We will firſt begin to ſpeake of the

Army conducted by the Marquis Spinola,
whereof ſome three months paſt a great
rumor went, aſwell by taking vp of new
forces, withdrawing of his olde Souldiers,
as alſo his marches, ſieges, and taking in
of the towns & places, lying in the countrie
of Gulicke, Cleue and Berch.
            
            In the moneth of Auguſt, the Marquis
hauing gathered an Army together marched
from Brabant to the towne of Tongeren,
and ſo to Maſtricke, where he increaſed
his Armie, and here came his forces
from all places marching. It was reported
his campe was then twentie thouſand
ſtrong aſwell horſe as foot. From thence
he went with his whole Army the twentieth
of Auguſt, marching through the
Country of Valkenburch, towards the town
of Acon or Aken; before which he came the
two and twentieth of Auguſt, deuiding
his Campe in three quarters, the one at
Bortſet, the other at the Townes place
of Execution, and the third at Saint

               Sauiours Hill, making preſentlie his batteries
cloſe vnder the Towne, charging
alſo euery Souldier to bring fiue
fagots to aſſault the Towne fiercelie
and with all ſpeed, ſeeming to be ſomwhat
incenſed againſt this Towne.
            The Romiſh Catholikes within,
ſeeing they were ſo fiercelie aſſaulted,
fled altogether with their goods into
the Cloiſters. And thoſe of the reformed
Proteſtants Religion, ſeeing the
ſame, were not a little amaſed, and
thereupon thought it fitte to conferre
with him; whereunto the Marquiſſe
Spinola ſeemed to bee vnwilling; notwithſtanding
at the entreaty and requeſt
of Graue Henry vanden Berghe,
the Prior of the Cloiſter of Acon, with
the Abbeſſe of Bortſet, who at three
ſeuerall times humbly entreated for the
Citizens or Burgars, he condiſcended
to a Parlee, and concluded vpon the
foure and twentieth of Auguſt, and the

keyes were deliuered into his handes,
placing for Gouernour of the Towne
the Earle of Ritbergen, brother vnto the
Earle of Embden; permitting the Souldiers,
who on the behalfe of the Brandenburger
lay within the town, to march
forth with their full Armes, flying
Enſignes, burning matches, &c. Placing
for the Garriſon of the Towne fifteen
hundreth new entertained Lutzenburgar
Souldiers, and ſo marched forward
with his whole Armie towards Dueren.
The which thoſe of the town vnderſtanding
and perceiuing that he would
aſſault them, durſt not ſtay his comming,
but reſolued to meet him, and
deliuered him the keyes at his firſt
approach, and ſo yeelded themſelues
without compulſion or any ſhot of
Canon. The Marquis placing his Souldiers
therin, and ſo inſtantlie ſet forward
towards Berchem: Where he ſent part
of his Souldiers towards Collen, to the

end with the aide of the Burgers of
Collen to ſpoile and deface the Town
of Mulhem, the which with great rage
of the Burgars of Collen, and the Soldiers
of the Marquis Spinola was begun,
and after that they had beaten
downe the walles, they inſtantlie beganne
to fall vpon the new houſes,
but by the commandement of the
Newburger, vpon paine of death, it was
left vndone, ſo as the Proteſtant inhabitants
remaine as yet reaſonable peaceable
in their ſeuerall houſes. A garriſon
onelie there remaining. Then hee
marched forward in good order with
the whole Campe through the countrie
of Gulicke towards Rynbercke, where
when he came, hee made a Bridge ouer
the Ryne, where the whole Armie
of the Marquis marched ouer, ioining
themſelues to the forces of Lingen and
Oldenſeel, who had long expected his
comming thither, marching all together

towards Weſel. And by the way
with thoſe of Gelder and Berck, he went
tovvards Orſoy, as hereafter follovveth.
There firſt entred in fiue or ſixe horſemen
of Bercke earely in the morning
when the Milke maides went out, and
for that there was but ſlender watch
held, they kept the gates, and the other
being preſentlie at hand, marched
without making any ſhot, hauing by
them two peeces of Ordinance, and about
ſixe hundred men ſtrong.
            Then the Marqueſſe marched towardes
Weſel, and betweene the riuer
of Lip and Weſell lyeth ſtrongly entrenched
towards the field ſide of Lip,
neare the towne.
            And then a great part of the Campe
in all haſte attempted to ſhoote vpon
the towne, and by force to compell the
ſame, euen as with all ſpeed they did,

cauſing ſuch a feare in ſhort time in the
City, that the Burgars who being couragious,
with that haſt were aſtoniſhed,
& being altogether diſcouraged, found
it conuenient to agree with the Marqueſſe,
which happened on the fifth of
September, condicioning libertie of religion,
and reſeruing their old priuiledges,
but the Towne ſhould be kept with
the Garriſon of the Marqueſſe Spinola.
The Ordnance and Munition of the
Brandeburger beeing in the Towne, ſome
daies after was ſent downe the Ryne, towards
the towne of Rees, after long conference
and deliberation thereabout
held, betweene the Marqueſſe, and the
Duke of Newburgh.
            
            And in the Marſh before Weſell, the
Marqueſſe Spinola hath made a ſtrong
Sconce to compell the towne, and to
hinder the paſſages of ſhippes by the
Rhyne.
            
            
               
As alſo three halfe moones the Marqueſſe
hath cauſed to bee made before
the three gates of the towne, placing his
Centinells or the outward watches toward
the Campe of his Excellency of
Naſſau.
            
            Now ſhortly after that the Marques
had gotten Weſell, hee purpoſed to haue
made himſelfe Maſter of Rees, to the
which end hee had already ſent forces,
but his excellency was come there about
an houre before, who in good
time enuironed the towne and tooke
it in.
            Alſo it happened that the Marqueſſe
had gotten Santen an houre before that
his Excellency with his forces came
there.
            And euen ſo it remaines at this inſtant
with the Marqueſſe Spinola and his
whole army.
            
               Now therefore come wee to ſpeake
of his Excellency of Naſſau and his army
as followeth.
         
         
            
            THE DESCRIPTIon
of the Armie of his
euer-renowmed
Excellencie.
            
            
               THE noble Lords the Eſtates
with his princely
Excellency their Generall,
vnderſtanding of
the great preparation
of the Marqueſſe Spinola,
alſo hauing knowledge of the taking
in of Acon, Duren, and other places,
that hee alſo purpoſed to come
downe neere towards Weſel, (the Marqueſſe
of Brandeburgh crauing by Embaſſage
their aſsiſtance) they reſolued

to goe againſt him, and leauied ſouldiers
out of all quarters, & firſt ſent them
vp toward Sgrauen weert, Elten, and therabouts,
his Princely Excellency himſelfe
in perſon with all ſpeede from the
Haghe, (accompanied with the noble
Earles, Graue William, Graue Iohn, Graue
Earneſt, of the houſe of Naſſau; and the
Prince of Portugall,) trauelling by day
and night came thither. Firſt and formoſt
making himſelfe ſure, and tooke
in the towne of Emericke with the forces
hee had with him, preſently marching
from thence towards Rees, which he alſo
in good time, as is aforeſaide, had
gotten before the Marqueſſe came: yea
and had not his Excellency ſtaid the
longer at the Haghe, vpon the comming
of his Maieſty of Great Britaine,
and the French Kings Embaſſadors, vpon
a treaty of peace, the Marqueſſe certainely
might haue caſt his cap after
Weſell.
            
               
Then the Gouernour of Nymegen,
by command of his Princely excellency,
marched out the tenth of September
towards the towne of Goch, with
three great Cannons, and comming about
the village of Moock, there came
to him fiue companies more, marching
in haſt toward Goch aforeſaid, preſently
demanding vp the towne, but the cleargy
would not yeeld thereunto: the Gouernour
vnderſtanding this, preſently
cauſed the parculliſe of the gates to bee
ſet on fire, which they within ſeeing,
did bulwarke vp the gates with dung &
other dirt, but the Gouernour preſentlie
began to ſhoote with his Ordnance
which he had at hand, and to aſſault the
towne: the burgars ſeeing he was ſo furiouſly
bent, fearing to bee ſurpriſed,
made compoſition with him, and the eleuenth
of September, yeelded vp the
towne vnto him, who preſently put in
garriſon the ſouldiers of the Duke of

               Brandenburgh.
            
            The twelfth of this ſaid Moneth the
Gouernour aforeſaid marched towards
the Towne and Caſtle of Gennep which
he preſently tooke, wherein he alſo put
in garriſon the Brandenburgers men, ſending
alſo ſome forces towards Cleue,
Rauesteyn, and Sousbeck.
            
            From the Campe where his Excellency
firſt aſſembled, he ſent the new
Souldiers to aide the Brandenburger,
where hee lay ſome few dayes after.
            Then his Excellency cauſed to bee
made a Bridge before Embricke ouer
the Rhyne, where the new Souldiers
marched ouer, and went vp higher into
the country.
            The Campe of his Excellency lyeth
at this preſent on the Northſide of

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               Rees in very good order, vnto whom
dayly more men come, with horſemen
round about.
            His Excellency alſo cauſed an other
Bridge to bee made ouer the Rhyne before
Rees, with the halfe Moone,
where a great number of ſhips lie,
yea ſo many, that it is a great pleaſure
to ſee, and dayly yet more come
out of Holland. Here are already many
men marched ouer the bridge on
the ſide of Santen, and Marien-bome,
which his Excellency alſo hath gotten:
and here men thinke it will come to
blowes.
            And which is not to bee forgotten,
neere vnto Rees, his Excellency hath
a goodly troupe of horſemen which
lie for a watch.
            At a village called Biſlicke, diuers

meetings on both ſides, haue
been to come to an agreement,
but euery time as yet they
haue parted in
vaine.
         
         
            
            
            THE
DESCRIPTION
of the March of Count HENRIE
of Naſſau, to and in the
countries of Marck, as he departed
out of the Campe of his Excellency his
brother, likewiſe the deſcription of that
which happened vntill this preſent
day, alſo is hereunto added what
the Souldiers of the town of
Gulicke of late haue effected
and what towns
they haue taken.
            
               AFter that his Princelie
Excellencie, had lain a
certaine time between
the Towne of Emerick
and Rees: & had taken
thoſe Townes before

named, alſo the places and Townes
which his Excellencie cauſed by the
Gouernour of Nimmegen, to bee taken,
and garriſons therein to bee put, his
campe in the meane time grew ſtronger
both with horſe and foote, which
came from all quarters.
            And hauing this ſtrong Armie of
men together, a generall Muſter was
made, which the Marquis Spinola hearing,
thought they would come vpon
him, and cauſed inſtantlie a battery to
be made on the way of Rees: he had
a day before alſo, ſent out ſom troopes
higher vp into the country with certain
Wagons who ſpoiled and robbed the
poore countrimen of all that they had,
to the ende our Souldiers comming
thether ſhould find nothing: but what
bleſſing hee got thereby of the poore
Countrymen, I leaue euery one to
iudge.
            
               
The Marquis ſtrengthning himſelfe
before Weſell, and not comming into
the field out of his trenches, yet his
Excellency did vndertake ſome thing,
and ſent his brother Count Henry of
Naſſau accōpanied with a good troope
of horſe and foote, and ſome wagons
with Ordinance, munition and victuals
to the countries of Marck & Rauenſbergh,
&c. to take in March, Ham, Vnna, Soeſt,
Camen, Dortmondt, with others:
whereof this Count Henry hath already
taken manie, and put Garriſons therin.
            They report alſo that Count Henry
had ſent ſome Souldiers towards Borkelo,
lying (between Groll and Lochum) to
take it in, and to put a Garriſon therein,
for certaine reaſons between the Earle
of Stierum, and thoſe of the towne of
Munſter.
            
            Neither haue thoſe of Gulick beene

idle, but as valiant ſouldiers haue alſo
attempted ſome thing, and the newes
are currant that they haue taken in theſe
places following, namely, Linnich,
Waſſenberch, Rangelrayd, Geilkercken, Gangelt,
Sittert, &c.
            
            The Marquis ſeeing the courſe of his
victory in taking of the Towne of Weſel,
ſtayed for that his Princely Excellencie
came into field, and lay ſo cloſe
vnder his wings, found It fit for the firſt
to make ſtrong and to intrench himſelfe,
endeauouring to make a ſtrong
Fort neare to the Rhine before Weſell,
whereunto his Souldiers haue as greate
deſire as a thiefe hath to bee hanged
and doe plainely ſay this, we make for
our enemy, as wee made the Skonce of Saint
Andrew.
            
            Alſo they ſay, that the Marquis
(becauſe hee will not make the Burgers

of Weſell altogether his bitter enemies)
hath conſented that the Souldiers
lying in the houſes ſhall buye
and prouide their owne victuals: for the
which thoſe of the towne muſt euerie
weeke diſburſe two thouſand Gilders,
euery one according to his ability.
            Moreouer, there is newes come out
of the Campe of the Marquis Spinola,
that the Regiment of the Colonell Palant,
being ſtrong; about twelue companies
with three peeces of Ordnance,
is marched towards Venlo and Geldor,
and it is thought they goe to take the
other remaining ſmall townes, namely
Brughe, Dulken, Dalen and Glabberck. In
fine, euery one hath a ſnatch at that he
can gette, but the poore countriman
muſt looke to himſelfe, therefore the
olde Prouerbe is true, euery one for himſelfe.
            
            It is reported alſo that his excellency

will attempt ſome other matter of no
ſmall moment, but where and what,
the time will ſhew. There is preparation
in hand to make a ſtronger bridge
of ſhippes for the paſſage of wagons ouer
the Ryne: and according to that preparation:
It is alſo thought hee will
march higher vp the Ryne then Rees.
            
            
               Aliquid latet quod non patet.
            
            The Clergy haue procured and effected
ſo much this yeare, for to aide his
Holineſſe louing new-borne ſonne the
Duke of Newburgh that a multitude of
men are already come to the field vnder
the conduct of the Marquis Spinola, who
haue already vtterly vndone many
thouſand poore men. But what confuſion
of ſeuerall nations of people, hee
to aid the Newburger bringeth into the
country he himſelfe doubtleſſe will find
in time. If he had had ſuch a proſperous

ceſſe as he had in the beginning, he had
gone more forward in his deſignes, and
alſo the Arch-Duke ſhould haue gained
more by his twelue years truce, then by
a long continuall warre, and hee had
had fit time in theſe fiue yeares to haue
made conqueſt of theſe countries, beeing
friends to the vnited Prouinces: and
then to come vpon vs.
            FINIS.
