            TO THE RIGHT REVEREND
FATHER in God, and Right Honourable LORD,
JOHN, Lord Biſhop of Lincolne, Lord Keeper of the
great SEALE, of his Maieſties moſt Honourable
PRIVIE COVNCELL, &c.
            
               Right Reuerend, and Right Honourable:
            
            
               I Haue little Learning, but I haue ſo much Muſicke, as to know there is no
diſcord ſo harſh, as when Benefits and vngratefulneſſe are put together.
This is a diſcord that cannot be tempered by any art, to make a grace, or to
make the harmonie more rare and artificiall. It were a ſhame for me therefore,
that know ſomewhat in Muſicke, to commit ſuch an vnpardonable errour
in manners. And this I muſt of neceſſitie doe, if with all humility from
the deepeſt thoughts of my heart, in priuate and in publique, I doe not expreſſe
all poſſible thankefulneſſe to ſo Great, ſo Wiſe, ſo Learned, ſo Noble,
and bountifull a Patron and Benefactour. Goodneſſe is not to be eſteemed by quantity. A Hand or
an Eye drawne by a curious Painter, is worth a large Table done by an ordinarie Hand: But your
Lordſhips Beneficence was both great and good. For it was an Annuity for my life; and it was done
ſo, that it had in it all that can commend a good deed. It was not done for allyance, or former knowledge,
which makes a benefit a debt: Not for Seruice paſt; for that is not a benefit, but a reward:
Not wrung or forced by long ſuit, or mediation of friends, which puls downe the price of any benefit:
Not after long delay and much wayting, which is the torment of Suitours, and makes a benefit payd
for before it come. Not done with wayward lookes, and chiding, which vnder the colour of good
counſell, giues a benefit a bitter taſte of contumelie. Nor wonne after ſome denyals and repulſes;
that which we wraſtle for, we account our owne. Neither was it giuen vpon no cauſe, for ſo benefits
are not placed but caſt away. It had none of theſe, but all the contrary commendations. For your
Lordſhip conferred it on me when I was vnknowne vnto you, when no man had euer ſpoken for me;
when I was farre remote and leaſt thought of ſo Honourable a friend, and leſſe of ſuch a fauour,
and it was ſent by your Lordſhip to me; and all this done ſo, that when I came to ſent my thankes,
your Lordſhip knew not who I was; yet was it done vpon hearing of ſome Motects of mine, of which
I would not in modeſty ſpeake, but that it makes for your Lordſhips iuſt praiſe; He doth not giue,
but throw away, that hath no reaſon for his giuing: Let the world then be iudge, if I haue not good
cauſe to profeſſe all thankefulneſſe. And if euery man, whom your Lordſhip hath thus preuented
in greater matters (as I haue heard of a great many ſince this fauour was done to me) had opportunity
or would take occaſion to giue your Lordſhip thankes as this Paper doth, it would turne the
enuy of ſome ill-diſpoſed, into admiration of your ſweet and noble nature. For my poore ſelfe, I haue
haſtened theſe few Motects, that I might ſhow ſome part of my thankefulneſſe, and be further
indebted to your Lordſhip, for a new fauour, in taking them vnder your Lordſhips protection. I
know they are not worthy your Lordſhips eare, but thankefulneſſe conſiſts not in the meanes, but
in the heart of him that for benefits is engaged. Yet it would be ſome content to me, if I were ſure,
that as many eyes would looke vpon this Epiſtle, as it may be there will be eares to heare the Songs
I preſent. But I muſt be content with the inward teſtimonie of my heart, in which I will daily pray
for your Lordſhips happineſſe, and honour, and reſt
            
               Your Lordſhips moſt humbly deuoted,
MICHAELL EST.
