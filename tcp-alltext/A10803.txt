               ALEXANDER (Right Worſhipfull) amongeſt men greateſt on the earth, ceaſing his hard toile frō purſuit of his enemies, he held no recreation in ſuch account, as reading of hiſtories, eſpecially ſuch as treated of the honours gained by noble warriours long before his time entombed in the intralles of the earth: wherein his delight was as much as in maniging his ſteed, or ſhiuering his lance in the midſt of his foes.
            SCIPIO that noble Romaine which ſubdued manie nations had no ſmall delight in the like exerciſe: noting by reading the euentes of war, and pleaſant baites of fortune, how Warriours gained honor: and then againe how they were ſubdued: the mighty kings by peſantes and men of baſe account diſplaced, and the ignoble exalted, changing all eſtates at her pleaſure. This Fortune (of the Poets fained a Goddeſſe) hauing the

raigne of all eſtates in her hand, diſpoſeth like a blind guide, at her wil, ſetting vp and pulling down, whom ſhe liſt to ouerthrowe or aduance.
            An example of which (right Wor.) I preſent to you in this hiſtorie, wherein you ſhall ſee her mutabilitie, ſhewing continuallie her froward & vnconſtant mind, in croſsing that noble and vnhappie prince Andrugio, ſometime Duke of Saxonie, whoſe miſeries exceeded al that euer I read or heard of: from the ſixteenth yeare of his age neuer inioieng long time of content according to his eſtate, but manie daies ſpent he in extreame miſerie, as the hiſtorie of his life ſhal manifeſt, to which I leaue you: humbly beſeeching your Worſhip to ſhield it vnder your protection, and when time ſhall permit you leaſure, vouchſafe the reading of it, in which I doubt not (albeit the ſtyle be rude) but that you ſhall finde ſomething to delight you.
            And if it ſo happen, I haue my wiſh, and the long deſire I haue had to make my zeale knowne vnto your worſhip, in ſom

            The Miſeries of ANDRVGIO, Duke of Saxonie.
            
               
                  SIENA, famous throughout the world for beautiful ſcituation, ciuill gouernment, good education, and proſiting of her ſtudents, was ſo renowmed, that none of any reputation liuing within the dominions of the Emperour, but had an eſpeciall deſire to haue their ſonnes trained in that vniuerſitie, eſpecially the Dukes, princes and Nobles. Amongſt many gallant youthes, to whoſe eares fame had bruited this peereleſſe report of ſo goodly a City with the vertues therein abounding, Andrugio ſome and heire apparant to the noble Duke of Saxonie, a toward Gentleman, prone to all vertuous exerciſes, deſirous to attaine the knowledge of al artes, hearing the fame of Siena, deſirous alſo to ſee the place, and to ſpend his time in ſtudy, as alſo to acquaint himſelfe with other princes which came from all partes to this place to ſee their behauiour, and knowe the maners of their countrie: pricked with a continuall deſire to this attempt, maketh humble ſuite vnto the Duke his father for the furthering of this entent, which ſo long he proſecuteth in ſuch earneſt maner, that after manie denials of the aged Duke, as a louing father, whoſe tender care might not endure the abſence of his deare and only ſonne, hauing a fatherly regard vnto him, yea, and mor

            Theſe Nobles hearing ſo honorable a motion of the yoong Lord, wel noting his delight in ſtudie at home, beeing of years ſo tender, not yet attaining to the full tearm of ſixteen yeers, wer wōderfully amazed to hear ſo e

                  THe noble mind of this yong prince, now in the flouriſhing tune of his age, began to ſhewe it ſelfe in ſuch ſort, as he might wel be knowen to deſcend of ſo honorable Parentage as the Duke of Saxonie: for, as the ſonne-beames cannot be hid, ſo did vertue appeare in him, pricking a forwardneſſe to his deſires, to ſee the maners and gouernment of other countries: But too ſoone (alas) hath this naturall Father yeelded to the deſire of ſo greene a head, whoſe yeares doo ſcarſly require the raine to be left in his owne hand, as you ſhall heare.
               Fortune, mutable & vnconſtant dame, deſirous to ſhewe what ſhe could doo, hauing brought this yoongling to the top of his deſires, began now to checke him with ſuch a bit, as might well ſerue a colte of elder year
                     •
                  s, for beeing void of all doubtes of any miſchaunce to betide him or his companions, ſuch miſeries was he oppreſſed with, as are moſt lamentable to be remembred.
               For, vnderſtand after his departure from the Court of his Father, traueiling by guides (as the maner of the country is) thorow vncoth places, enuyroned with wooddes, and hanted with multitudes of wilde beaſtes, a noble man of Italy, baniſhed from his countrie for a moſt hainous treaſon

conſpired againſt the prince of the land, ranged continually thoſe deſartes, where he with his companions became moſt cruell manſlears, and ſpoylers of as many as fell into their hands, without feare of God, or reſpect of chriſtianity. Neuer was there any tyrant of what name or condition ſoeuer, ſo cruel as this miſchieuous Gonſala Ieriomanim, for ſo was he called.
               Earneſt trauell within ſmall time hath brought this youth Andrugio with his companie within the precinct of this curſed murtherer, where he kept his reſidence, lodged in caues and holdes of their own framing. Of whoſe ſcouts Andrugio was no ſooner eſpied, but with al poſſible ſpeed they prouide to meete them, armed in all partes, as if they ſhould encounter their profeſſed enemies in the field.
               
                  Andrugio void of all feare, tooke great pleaſure in this iourney, paſſing in pleaſant diſcourſes the time to beguile their trauell: But (alas) in midſt of theſe pleaſures, befel them moſt vnhappie fortune, euen as the ſillie lambes, ſkipping by the ſide of their tender damme, is by the rauening Woolfe bereaued of life. So fares it with Andrugio, who no ſooner came to the place wher theſe reprobats lay in ambuſh, attending their comming. But Gonſala ſtern & fierce of courage with his followers reſolued to be their deathes, furiouſly aſſailed them, and in ſmall time, taking them at aduantage, ouercame them, leauing not one to breath, as they ſuppoſed, bathing their murdering blades in the blood of theſe Gentils: taking ſpoyle of their treaſure and other prouiſion, they leaue their bodies couered with moſſe and looſe leaues, ſpeeding them to their places of refuge, reioicing with the ſpoile of thoſe poore innocents, whom m

               Now beholde the vnſpeakeable goodneſſe of God vnto this Lord Andrugio, whoſe woundes being not ſo deep as the reſt of his friendes, after a litle trance began to recouer, when breathing with a piteous grone, he ſtriued to recouer his feet to ſtand: but the blood being cold about his wounds

                  Andrugio, what cruell ſtarres guided thy byrthday? or what curſed hag bewitched thee to motion a ſuit vnto thy noble father, ſo greatly diſpleaſing the Gods, who noting thy follies, haue appointed theſe vnmercifull murderers to daunger thine owne life, and bereaue thee of thy friends, appointed by thy carefull father for a comfort vnto thee? O that the heauens had neuer condeſcended vnto my natiuitie, or that in my cradle I had (like Hercules) bene aſſailed by ſome poyſoned ſcrpents, which might haue abridged my life! But like Mydas wiſh I for that that diſpleaſeth the Gods. Andrugio, vnhappie Andrugio, and moſt vnfortunate in being ſonne vnto ſo noble a Duke, whoſe life muſt end in theſe accurſed deſartes, and no man to make report vnto thy aged father, what is become of thee or thy companions, whoſe deathes by following thee in thy follie, is thus befallen them: curſed therefore Andrugio, whoſe deſires haue robbed ſo noble gentlemen of their ſonnes, gallant ladies and faire gentlewomen of their loues, and thy renowmed father of an heire to ſucceede him in his Dukedome. O heauens, might your furie with my life haue bene appeaſed, how happie had I bene! that the wrath of him whom I haue prouoked to ire, might haue fallen vpon mine owne head: then noble friends, ſhould you haue enioied life to haue reported my tragedy, which now are left void of all comfort to be a pray to the rauening beaſtes of this Deſart, and to the foules of the aire. Yet kind Gods, whoſe pitifull condition is not to puniſh at ful, the witkednes of your creatures: Heare with the eares of mercy my laſt petition, and ſende thy meſſenger Ziperus to blow into the eares of our comfootleſſe

Parentes and friendes, our vntimely tragedies, that they knowing the place where our mangled bodies lie, may entomb vs with our anceſtors, and reuenge our deaths on thoſe moſt curſed homicides, whoſe bloody handes haue bene our confuſions.
               Scarſly could he finiſh his ſorrowfull ſpeach, when beeing faint with the loſſe of blood iſſuing from his wounds, and ouercharged with ſorrow for his friends lieng ſlain by him, he gaue ſo heauie a ſigh as might haue mooued a hart of flint to pitie his eſtate.
               In this extremitie, behold, a comfort: for loe, a poore labouring man, ſeruant vnto a miller, dwelling two miles diſtant from the place where he receiued his wounds, ſearching for the ſtraied beaſtes of his ſaide maiſter Miller, happened by great chance to ouerheare this wofull complaint: which ended, ſtanding halfe amaſed to heare ſo ſweet a voice, caſting many waies in his ſimple minde the daungers, and ſubtilties of ſpoiling miſcreants, ſuppoſed verily that it had bin a deuiſe of ſome villaine, lurking there abouts of purpoſe to betray traueilers, and to bring them within their compaſſe to rob them. Thus many wayes miſdoubting the worſt, not yet reſolued whether to depart, or to ſee what he was that made ſuch a piteous mone: at length taking vnto him the hart of Sampſon, he boldly ſtepped ouer the hedge into the groue whereas this wounded Andrugio lay.
               No ſooner was he entred this groue, but viewing round the place, like a good Pilate for feare of rocks, glancing his eies eftſoons to the ground, then els where, hee chaunced to eſpie great ſtore of blood, which when he had with no ſmal admiration beheld, putting on his holyday countenance, like an hardie ſquire, he marched on, following the tracke of the blood, vntil he came vnto that place whereas all thoſe dead carkaſſes lay, when he had recouered the ſight of theſe wounded men, his hart trembled with griefe, & was worſe mooued at the diſcouering of them then euer in his life before,

ſtanding thus in his dumpes, deuiſing whether it were beſt to touch them or no: caſting his eies ſtedfaſtly on them, ſuruaieng their grieuous woundes. Andrugio faint and full of paine with the extreamitie of his woundes, breathed ſoftlie: which being noted of this ſwaine, drewe neere vnto him, layeng tenderly his hand on the ſtomach of Andrugio felt a panting ſhort wind withn him, whereat the man being ſomewhat ioyfull, rubbed his temples, ſo by litle and lytle recouered him.
               When this kind-hearted ſwaine had by his diligence recouered Andrugio, and that perfectneſſe of memorie was againe reſtored him, as a wight grieued at the miſchances he ſaw was hapned, he comforteth him in this wiſe.
               Gentleman (quoth he) for ſo your countenance ſheweth me, what euill fortune hath brought you vnto this pitifull plight? or by whoſe hands haue you with theſe your companie bene ſo cruellie mangled? tell me I beſeech you, that reuenging your iniuries, I may purſue with diligēce thoſe bloodthirſty billaines, and by their deathes make ſatiſfaction to the Gods, and thoſe innocentes ſoules that they haue murthered.
               
                  Andrugio with gaſtly countenance looking earneſtlie in the face of this comforter, after hee had a while attentiuelye hearkened vnto his ſpeeches, thus anſwered.
               Whoſoeuer thou be (gentle friend) that the Gods haue thus apointed for my help in this extremitie: I yeld thanks according to thy curteous deſerts: but couldeſt thou ſhew as much grace to theſe my diſtreſſed friends here lien, howe great cauſe I ſhould haue to glorifie the Gods, and honor thee, my tongue cannot expreſſe, wretched and vnfortunate that I am: yet gentle friend, in whom ſuch courteſie remaineth, do me fauour ſo much, as to tell me howe thou earneſt to this place, and thy dwelling: and thou that art a man chriſtian and kind, as thy paines on me beſtowed beare witnes, vouchſafe, in ſuch ſort as thou canſt, to comfort theſe my friendes, and ſee if it hath ſo pleaſed the Gods to giue any

one of them leaue to eſcape the heauie vengeance of thoſe accurſed ſlaues that haue robbed vs of our ſubſtance, and murdered our bodies: and the reſt that haue yeelded their liues to the furie of thoſe tyrantes blades, helpe me to entombe them according to their callinges, who were all Gentlemen of account, which is the greateſt honour I can doe them: for the which as they died Innocents, their ſoules ſhall yeeld thee thanks before the throne of the greateſt god where we ſhall all meete.
               Sir (quoth the ſwaine) I ſee your wan lookes betoken faintneſſe, by occaſion of your great loſſe of blood: wherfore if you will hearken vnto the counſell of ſo ſimple a creature as my ſelfe, you ſhall ceaſe this parlie vntill you ſhal better endure it, and haue recouered more ſtrength. Two miles at leaſt haue I to my maiſters home, which is a ſillie cottage, not worthy to entertame ſuch a one as you ſeeme to be: yet as it is, your welcome ſhalbe as to your owne: his only victuals is goats milk, a white cake, oile, & honny, which command at your will. If theſe may in extremitie pleaſure you, ariſe and reſt you on my ſhoulders, for I ſee you are feeble, vntill I haue brought you where you may refreſh you. As for your friends, whom you ſo much bewaile, ſuffer them to reſt in peace, for your wailings may not be any way auaylable vnto them, and to morrow my maiſter, with ſuch helpe as we can prouide, ſhal fulfil your requeſt, and burie them, though not as you would wiſh, yet as we may, in the better ſort.
               
                  Andrugio wounded and faint, hearkening to his words yt he ſpake of good wil, began to rouſe himſelf: but ſo weak was he, that alone w

Whē he had refreſhed his wearied weak carcaſe, the good old wife began for his better comfort theſe ſpeaches.

               Thanks (quoth Andrugio) to the heauēly powers firſt, for prouiding me this good: and next to thee (my friendlee Hoſteſſe) for thy fauour beſtowed on me, which might periſh without comfort: but what friendſhip thou ſhalt impart

vnto me in this diſtreſſe, if the pleaſure of the deuine Deity be to reſtore me againe, thy courteſie ſhal be recompenced, and this kindneſſe to thee and thine neuer be forgotten.
               Thus leaue we Andrugio a while at his reſt, attended on with Sufania, curteous and friēdly vnto her charge, deliuered by her ancient mother: the old wife taking like care for the buriall of the dead bodies, which in the beſt ſort was ſhortly accompliſhed.
               
                  Suſania ye good wench, attēding diligētly on her charge, hath in ſhort time by the care ſhe had of him, recouered his ſtrength, that forſaking his bed, he walked often about his chamber, not daring yet to aduenture into the ayre. Andrugio all this time of ſickneſſe noted the curteous demeanor of his attendant: and often times, as ſtrength increaſed in him, would take great pleaſure to trie her wit by pleaſant parlie, ſometime diſcourſing of one thing, and ſo enterchangeablie of many. But ſo long the flie plaieth with the flame, that at length ſhe is conſtrained to die through her follie: ſo fares it now with Andrugio, whoſe fine head had ſo long propounded quick queſtions, and was ſo ſharplie anſwer to of Suſania, that his fancie began to ſettle on the maiden in ſuch ſort, that it grew from ſmall kindeled coales, to great flames: inſomuch that nothing was pleaſing vnto him, if Suſania had not bene at the dooing therof: yea, ſuch in ſhort time became his affections, that neuer was his wounds ſo grieuous as ſhe abſence of Suſania: euermore recountring in his mind her beautie, courteſie, and qualities which did in all pointes ſo far paſſe the vulgar ſort, as the white ſnow dooth exceed in beautie the blacke pitch. Theſe graces ſo abounding in Suſania, haue ſo beſotted Andrugio his ſences that he is driuen now to non plus, amazed which vertue to commend as principall in her. As theſe cogitations beginning in him, ſo the feruent heat of loues paſſion encreaſeth in ſuch ſort, as there is no other pleaſure to bee had of him but onely in commending the perſon, wit, and condition of Suſania: yea, now is his onely ſtudy how to

pleaſe her, and his greateſt care to make his loue knowne vnto her. Thus as a man of reaſon cleane bereft, he calleth to mind his honorable diſcent: and then againe the baſe linage of Suſania, being no better by byrth then the child of a ſimple Miller, in whoſe companie he was at that ſeaſon recident which began to make him regard his nobilitie and waieng the honorable houſe of Saxony. To take aduiſe how by ioyning in mariage wt a perſon ſo inferior to his eſtate, might diſhonour his progenie, & enbaſe his poſteriue. But Loue who is now great maiſter of his affections, ſeeing himſelfe by reaſons almoſt expulſed, begad againe to aſſault him in ſuch wiſe, as Suſania, no none but Suſania, faire and moſt braue Suſania, and the chiefe of humaine creatures, his onelie attendant Suſania.
               
               In this paſſion, behow, his beloued hauing care of her charge, entered the chamber with ſome daintie prouided of purpoſe for Andrugio: whom he no ſooner beheld, but his ſpirites with ioy died within him. whoſe ſtrange paſſion grieued Suſania at the heart to ſee him, whom with ſuch care ſhe had nouriſhed, when all dangers of his woundes were paſſed, to be in ſo faint a caſe: his collour which eftſoons was like the ſanguin roſe, is now pale and wan as the lilly: his breathing tronke readye to deliuer his laſt gaſpe: Suſania carefull and diligent, noting the ſtraungeneſſe of the ſame, began greatly to maruell thereat, ſuſpecting her ſe

                  fe, to be the cauſe of that griefe: like a kind phiſition carfull of her patient, rubbes his temples, and with her tender hande ſtroked his cheekes ſoftly, ſprinkling on them ſweete water of roſes diſtilled, and often with her tender lips would lend him many a ſweet kiſſe, bedewing his honny mouth with her milke-warme teares, in this ſort bewailing the diſtreſſed eſtate of Andrugio.
               
               Ye heauenly Gods, by whoſe deuine powers all creatures breath life, what heauy ſinnes hath your handmaide committed againſt your Deities, that for my ſake you ſhew vengeance upon this weake creature, whom (as ye know) I

haue with all diligence to my vttermoſt power releeued, ſince his comming to this homely cottage of my poore Father, in whō I hoped to haue bin happy by my careful pains for his releefe, emploied by your aſſiſtants for the recouery of his former health, in curing thoſe grieuous woundes where with his weak body was afflicted. Yf your crueltie be ſuch in requitall of my charitable mind, or that your vengeance hath not bin ſufficiētly ſhewed to my charge: yet vouchſafe of your Godheads, in whom it conſiſteth to pardon and puniſh, to take your heauie handes from this curteous Gentleman, whom you haue puniſhed, and let him liue to be the comfort of many, which may be comfortleſſe, and ſuch your furie poure vpon me, as may free this Gentleman from all diſpleaſure whatſoeuer.
               
                  Andrugio comming to himſeife, and hearing a ſound of lamentation, looking vp, ſaw before him ye obiect of his life, and noting her blubbered eies, which ſhewed her heauines, and her cheekes beſprent with teares, mooued to pitie her extremitie, not knowing it was for his ſake, comforted her in this ſort.
               
                  Suſania the careful miniſter, next vnder the Gods, of my life, whoſe paines haue reſtored my wounded body, whoſe trauailes I connot requite, thanks is the onely recompence I can make thee yet, albeit my deſire is to perfourme much more: but with that ſacrifice of hartie thankes bee the Gods pleaſed. Then ſweet Suſania, no leſſe in comfort to thy poor charge, then the Gods, 
                     •
                  ccept thou the ſame at his handes that greueth, yea whoſe ſoule lamenteth to behold thy waylings, of which I know not the cauſe: but if there remaine in thee that courteſie, as is commonly found in your ſexe, participate with me of griefe, to the end I may to my power requite thee with comfort: for aſſure thee Suſania, there is none vnder the globe of the celeſtiall firmament, whome my heart hath ſuch deſire to honor as thy ſelfe. Wherefore my deareſt ſuſtainer, if thou haſt any affiance in thy charge, ſpeake boldly as to thy ſelfe, imagining thou dooſt commit

the ſecretes of thy ſweet breaſt too thine owne heart.
               The old Beldame hauing ſome want of her daughter, to be emploied in her buſines, enterrupting their ſpeech by calling her with her ſhril voice, cauſed them to leaue their parly for a time.
               
                  Suſania being gone (as duetie commanded) Andrugio began within himſelfe to call to mind the courteſie, wiſdom, and good gouernment of his ſweet attendant, entring ſo far into the laborinth of loue, as he is likely to looſe himſelfe, where reaſon could not ſuppreſſe will, nor wiſdome control affection: ſomuch hath this lunatike fitte diſtempered his braines, which made him enter into theſe tearmes.
               Why Andrugio, what fancie hath bewitched thee? art thou abnoſt growen to mans eſtate, and art thou ſo little ma
                     •
                  ſter of thy ſelfe? If thou do but gaze on a picture, muſt thou like Pigmalion be in loue with it? Canſt thou not taſt wine except thou be drunke with it? Maiſt thou not warme thee without burning? Ah fondling as thou art, know this, Fire is to be felt, not handled: the collour Argicke, poyſon by nature, may be caried in the hand, but eaten it is death: and beautie firſt ordained of the Gods to feed mans eie, not to coroſiue, the heart, Do not then as the ſimple fiſh, ſwallow the bait yt wil breed thy deſtruction: wade not too deep, vſe beautie, but honour it not, vſe it as a game for thy paſtime, yet ſwallow it not. But fond foole, knoweſt thou not that Loue is tearmed of the wiſe a God, then by reaſon and dutie ought to be obeied: Loue hath commanded the mightie, yea the Gods themſelues. Iupiter diſdaining Cupids power, reſiſted him, yet went by the worſt, and yeelded at length to his power. Iuno ſtrave with Venus, yet was vanquiſhed. Then ſtriue thou not with a ſore ſo dangerous, leaſt thou offend the Gods, and endanger thy ſelfe.
               Can beautie be reſiſted which made the Gods to bowe? Cupid himſelfe loued Phiches, and thinkeſt thou to bee of greater force? But what fondnes is this in thee Andrugio, to dandle thy ſelfe in ſuch follies? Thou didſt at thy comming

from thy father pretend ſtudy in the famous citie of Siena, and doeſt thou now forget that the benefite is great which learning bringeth? Educacion is more meete for thee than loue? Fooliſh boy, how can the ſtates of thy coū
                  trie thinke thee ſufficient to gouerne them, that canſt not rule thy ſelfe? Yt will be to much for thee to take ſo great a charge, which canſt not maiſter thy affect
                     •
                  ons. Yet Andrugio, if thou wilt needes loue, vſe it as men vſe the ſeeing of Comedies on a ſtage for recreation, where when thou art weary thou mayeſt depart at thy pleaſure. Then leaue to loue, but in this ſort ſubdue thine affections: be maiſter of thy mind, ſo maiſt thou laugh at Cupid and his fondlings, and ſay, thou waſt in loue, what then?
               He had ſcarſly finiſhed theſe wordes with a ſorrowfull ſigh, when Fortune that blind Goddeſſe, and his ſworne enemie hath brought Elanicus a yoong Noble of Saxonie, to the houſe of the Miſter, bound by the commaund of the Duke to the citie of Siena to ſeeke Andrugio, of whome there came no newes at all to the court of his Father ſince his departure. This Elanicus poſting thorow the deſartes, was warned by a ſwain whō he met, to ſhun the way wherin he rode, for that night approched, recountring vnto thē a moſt cruell murder committed there by vpon certaine Gentlemen not paſſing three mōnethes before. This newes appaled the heart of Elanicus. For about the ſame time Andrugio with his companie departed: for which cauſe he entered farther talke with the ſwaine, demaunding if he ſawe the dead carkaſſes of the ſlaine men: if he did, to recount vnto him their feature as neere as he might, with their apparell. To whom this ſwaine accompliſhing his requeſt, in rude maner deſcribing at large to all his demandes: the hearing of which ſo grieued Elanicus, that ſtarſly might he breath. But remooued from his dumps, he enquired how he came to the knowledge of this he had deliuered. Sir (quath he) dwelling not far hence, a neighbor of mine came 
                     〈◊〉
                   vnto the place where the murderers had left them:

where, by his paines, he recouered one proper Gent
                     ••
                  man, the reſt being buried as well as we could. Friend (queth Elanicus) ſith it hath pleaſed thee, to acquaint me of friendſhip, with theſe tidinges, and withall, war
                     •
                  ed me from falling into the hands of thoſe 
                     •
                  aitifes, I giue thee thanks. And if I may not be tedious vnto thee, that thou vouch ſafe to bring me where this recouered man reſteth, I will ſo ſatiſfie thee, as thou ſhalt haue no cauſe to complaine of looſing ſo much labour. Thus agreeing, the Swaine conducted him and his companie vnto the Miller, where Andrugio reſted.
               
                  Elanicus hauing well rewarded the Swaine, bad him farewell, whoſe ſodaine entring, the horſſe put Andrugio out of Loues cogitation. Elanicus meeting firſt with Suſania, ſaluted her as the maner of his countrey, with courteous congies, beſeeching the mayden of ſo great fauour, being a trauailer, and night growing on, for his mony to to haue entertainement.
               To whome Suſania, (whoſe womanly conditions more giuen by nature then education) aunſwered. Gentleman, what you are I knowe not: But I vnderſtand (good ſir) the owner of this filly cottage my father, being from home, I may not boldly preſume to giue entertainment to anie, how willing ſoeuer I were to the ſame, for many cauſes: and eſpecially, for that I doubt me greatly, you with your accō
                  plices are they, which moſt vnchriſtianlike ſlaughtered the Gentlemen of Saxon, as they trauelled thoſe deſertes. Wherefore, whether you be the ſame or whatſoeuer you be, take not diſcourteouſly the words of a ſillie mayden, but while you haue time, I beſeeche you depart elſwhere to prouide you.
               
                  Elanicus doubting to haue the repulſe, began to glorie with the mayden, beeing loth to depart without farther knowledge of Andrugio, and his companie: and therefore beſought her to take p
                     •
                  tie on his wearie carcaſe, worn with hard trauaile in ſearching for ſuch Gentlemen of Saxon, as

by her talke ſeemed to be dead, proteſting vnto her in moſt vehement oathes, that he was a ſtranger and born in Saxonie.
               
               
                  Andrugio, who had liſtened to their talke, hearing Elanicus to name Saxonie, was ſo rauiſhed with ſuddaine ioy, as he might not ſtand: recouering himſelfe, could not forbeare the preſence of his louing countriman, and companion, with whoſe ſpeach he was ſometime acquainted: but leauing his chamber, came to ſee him.
               
                  Andrugio no ſooner entring the place, where Elanicus ſate parlieng gently with the maiden, who might not in any cauſe be intreated to entertaine him, But being eſpied of Elanicus, his ſpeach ſodainly failed, and his tongue failtred in his mouth, he fell mainly on the ſhoulders of Andrugio, when paſſed his trance, he cried out: Ah my Lord, my louing Lord, what deſtinies haue brought you and your companie to theſe extremities? Are the Gods ſo vniuſt, that they will ſuffer your noble blood innocently ſhead, to goe vnreuenged? Little knoweth the Duke your father of your hard miſhap, yet doubting the worſt, hath ſent me to Siena, to know what mooued you to keepe the tydings of your happy artiual to the place of your deſire, wtout writing vnto him. But I ſee the Gods haue preuented your noble intent, by ſuffering your body grieuouſly to bee wounded, and your friends to reſt in death. Accurſed Fortune, who hath no
                     •
                   better prouided for you than thus, in the ſpring-time of your flouring yeares, to be thus maſacred. Yet thankes to the Gods that gaue you life: and thankes to your good Phiſition, whoſoeuer hee bee, whome if I might knowe, I will in ſome ſort requite as I may, though not as I would.
               Thankes Elanicus for thy kindneſſe. (quoth Andrugio) But happie had I bene if my life might haue accompanied my good friendes, which it had done, if this my ſweete Phiſition (taking Suſania by the hand) had not bin, whoſe cares as they haue bene great to reſtore me to health,

ſo will I neuer forget them, if the Goddes permit me life.
               But my Lord (quoth Elanicus) what is your Lordſhippes pleaſure to doo? Dooth your ſtrength ſerue you to beſtride a horſe? or ſhall wee make ſome prouiſion of coatch to conueigh you to the Court of your renowmed father?
               Ah, no my ſweete Elanicus (anſwered hee) if thou loue me (as thy paines employed in aduenturing thy ſelfe for my ſafetie ſufficiently witneſſeth) counſell mee not to returne to my Fathers Court vntill I haue ſpent ſome time in the famous Citie of Siena, to perfourme there, what my heart did deſire long time before I obtained licence for the ſame. Therefore ceaſe to take further cares for me: onely employ me with money for my neceſſarie vſes, and returne with what ſpeede you may to the Duke my father: This night ſhall you reſt with me, where your cates ſhall not be dainty, homelic, cleanly, and welcome your principal diſh.
               Thankes good my Lord, (quoth Elanicus: but thinke you that I may obtaine that fauour at your commaund, which intreating for the ſame ſo lately, was ſo hardly experſed?
               
                  Suſania intercepting Andrugio his wordes, anſwered, ſir, blame not a fearfull maiden to doubt the worſt, hauing too great a cauſe of late to bee warned: and to excuſe my boldneſſe, let my ſubmiſſion in the humbleſt wiſe make ſatiſfaction for my fault, and vouchſafe to accompanie your noble countriman, vnto whom both the Gods and Fortune (in my opinion) haue done great wrong, and my ſelfe (a rude maiden) with my aged parentes haue highly offended, in not giuing him the dutie to his eſtate belonging. But I truſt he will pardon the fault committed, ſith he himſelfe is the principall cauſe thereof, which would not make himſelfe knowen but onely in this tytle, a Gentleman of Saxonie, yet to ſuch prouiſion as wee coulde make in this wildernes he was welcome, ſo is your ſelfe if you accept it.
               
                  
A million of thankes (curteous maiden) I render thee for thy kindnes to this noble man which he hath found, vnknowen what he was, and therefore the more to be conſidered: VVhat cauſe he hath to honour ſo good an attendant as you haue ſhowed to be, for auoyding of flattery I omit.
               Thus paſſing the night in ioy, recountring their olde friendſhip, the next morning early, as Andrugio gaue directions, Elanicus leauing behinde him horſe and money, he haſteneth with al ſpeed to ſignifie vnto the Duke what had happened.
               
                  Andrugio feeling now the extremities of his woundes to be paſſed, imagining the duke would not ſuffer him farther to aduenture himſelfe when tidings ſhould be brought him of his perils eſcaped, and plight he remained in, not forgetting his affection towards Suſania, whoſe deſires the more he ſought to ſuppreſſe, ye more his hart was inflamed in loue towards her: wherefore hee reſolutely determining what to do, he waiteth opportunitie to diſcloſe his loue vnto her: which luckily was preſently offered. For lo
                     •
                  , Suſania in the midſt of theſe determinations, according to her ancient cuſtome, came to ſee her patient: wherefore ſetting al drea
                     •
                   apart, taking his fit time, knowing wel that ſecret forrowes doo confound the ſences, and that lingring in perill is the cauſe of many inſiting miſeries, thus boldlie he began to batter the bulwarke.
               Bluſh not Suſania, that for thy graces, I tell thee I loue: For (Suſania) Loue is in men, and therefore in me. Since therefore to ſtop the ſtreame dooth make the flood more fierce, and to ſuppreſſe the flame dooth make the fire encreaſe: Cammomill the more it is 
                     •
                  rodden, the more it ſpringeth: Wherefore Suſania, fearing the flame of my affection ſhall coroſiue my heart, know this, thy manifold vertues haue made ſuch an impreſſion in my heart, and the ſweetneſſe of thy feature ſo wounded me, that the blaze of the one and the bountie of the other hath broken the bulwarke of

my heart, where Loue aduanceth her Enſigne as conquero
                     •
                   and keepeth my hart priſoner, neither will ſhe deliuer but onely with this ranſome, Suſania her loue. Looke therefore my drare Suſania vpon thy captiue, and as thou haſt cured the outward woundes of my bodie, miniſter that ſweet portion to my hurt which my heart deſireth: that being healed by the phiſicke of thy affections, I may ioy in thee. Lookes (men ſay) are the meſſengers of loue, and outward motions the be

                  ers of inward malladies: then caſt thine eies vpon the countenance which doth manifeſt my care, and let thy thoughtes penetrate the heart that doth endure calamitie. Deeme, ſweet Suſania of my loue as of the Salamandar ſtone, which being once ſet on fire, will neuer be quenched: or the Emerald which graceth all other ſtones, but neuer looſeth his collour: ſo likewiſe neuer determinable ſhall be the loue of Andrugio to his beloued Suſania. Then Suſania in right conſider of my cauſe according to my care, nothing beſides thy bountie can procure my bliſſe, thy only perfection hath increaſed my pame: then let thy pitie ſet free my perſon from p

                  rill. The Porcupike that hurteth with his quilles makes a ſalue with his blood, and Aclytes ſpeare trieth an earneſt effect of both natures: ſo likewiſe it lieth in thee to apply the plaiſter that inferreth my paine, to miniſter ſuch phiſick as may cure my malladie. Sith then my life dependeth on thy loue, and my danger attendeth your ſpeedie redreſſe, let your courteſie finiſh my care, and repay my loue with his like.
               
                  Suſania, poore ſoule, neuer vſed to thoſe louing ſpeeches, and ſweet wordes vttered by Andrugio, was mute to heare ſo ſuddaine a motion: yet the thought of which tickl

                  e, which willingly ſhe could haue imbraced in her heart, reſembling the byrde Orpyes that hatcheth the Nightingale, yet will feed on her egges, ſo dooth her heart ſecretlye

reioiſe to thinke her ſelfe beloued of Andrugio: yet meaning to giue him a bitter pill, ſhe miniſtreth to him this portion.
               My good Lord Andrugio, I humblie beſeech you of pardon for my harſh behauiour toward your Lordſhip paſſed: but gratious Lord, wherein hath Suſania ſhewed her ſelfe at any time light of behauiour, that thus you goe about to intrap me to the lure of your will? if my dutie to my vtmoſt, ſhewed in your weakneſſe, breed luſt in your recouering health, I will prouide a new nurſe for you, and arme my ſelfe againſt the ſubtill piping of ſo cunning a Fouler, Yf your friendſhip be with your faining glozes to that end to bewich ſuch ignorant creatures as my ſelf, I muſt needs get the hearbe Glozia, a preſeruatiue againſt that malady, and intreat your Lordſhip to bee content with an other attendant: for wiſedome it is to beware in time, and warned, prouide to eſcape dangers. Yf your Lordſhip had bene before put in mind of the murderers waiting to kill you, I doubt whether you would haue aduentured the place wher they awaited you: therefore blame mee not to bee hereafter aduiſed how I come too neere you, and ſo farewell. Thus as it were in a litle chafe ſhe would haue departed, but Andrugio ſtaieng her, replied thus.
               Sweete Suſania, and louing, if thou tender his life whome with paine thou haſt nouriſhed ſo long, doo pitie me which vnfainedly cra
                     •
                  e it at thy bandes. Though Fowlers meane falſhood, Andrugio is faithfull. what if many men haue pleaded for obtainig of luſt the affections of Loue? yet blame not Andrugio till triall: if I bee falſe, then let the Gods poure vengeance vpon me, or when ANDRVGIO ſhall ſeeme to chaunge his amorous thoughtes of ſweete Suſania, the obiect of any life, let fire conſume me from the heauen.
               Enough of this my Lord, quoth Suſania, except it were to better purpoſe, for your talke is to no end but to bring a

foole to your becke, or at leaſt to ſee, whether my lightneſſe were ſuch as you ſuppoſe it.
               Credite me Suſania (anſwered this louing Lord) let my trueth make triall of my faith vnto thee: it is not luſt but the pure ſingle meanings of loue imprinted in my true heart. Therefore ſweete comfort of my life, reſpect thy ſeruant which humbly ſeeketh thy grace, ſtand not on tearmes with me, if thou tender my life, my progenie which I haue concealed, is now by fortune reuealed, whereby thou maiſt be aſſured it is no diſparagement to thee, to yeeld me loue of my affection towardes thee, but graunting it, ſhalt thereby increaſe the reputation of all thy anceſtrie, whom for thy ſake I will inueſt with titles of calling, for the more honour to thee. I ſtand, Suſania, vppon thornes, vntill I come to Siena, where my deſire hath led me, for feare of being preuented by my father in calling me home againe: therefore reſolue thee and let me not languiſhe for thy ſake, whome thou mayeſt eaſily remedie.
               Ah my Lord (quoth Suſania) it is a principle amongeſt Lappidarines, that the ſmooth ſtones be ſooneſt broken: amongſt faylers, where the water is moſt ſmootheſt, there likeſt danger: the greeneſt graſſe, hideth the moſte venomous ſerpent: the ſtone Granio looſeth his vertue, if it be not continually rubbed with golde, powder is no ſooner kindled, but it quencheth: mens affection may be compared to the Fawcon, that commeth to euery full fiſt, or to the ſpaniell, that will fawne vppon euerie one that holdeth bread in their hand.
               The ſtone Quacius freeſeth within, when it fryeth without, and ſighes may be fetched aſwel from the loongs, as from the heart, teares bee wrong out of the fingers when men be diſpoſed to fame: knowe you not that the new wrought dough wil receaue any impreſſion? Is it poſſible to take thoſe birdes, that hath eſpied the twigges? no, no: the hawke will neuer be called to that lure wherein the pennes of a Camelion are pricked, for well I knowe that

Better it is to ſkip with the lambe, in the ſweete field in freedome, then to be companion to the greateſt monarche in thraldom: which conſidered I neither can, as being not gouernour of my ſelfe, nor will yeeld my ſelfe to that yoke which I cannot ſhake off.
               Stay there Suſania, and giue me leaue to liue a while, that am ſure to die, when you pronounce denial: let not particular examples proue a full concluſion, though ſome haue bene falſe, all are not faultie, ſtones (I yeeld) are to be valued by the vertue, not by the outward viewe. But Suſania, thinke that ſtones may be better poliſhed, then vnperfected, and the defectes of nature, corrected by nature. An Emralde, hath many pernicious properties: but ſet in gold, is corrected by the vertue thereof.

                  Andrugio hauing thus clearkly diſcourſed for himſelfe, with a deepe ſigh ſealed his faithfull ſayinges, in ſuch ſort that the teares trickled downe her cheekes for ſorrowe to heare him. Which perceaued by Andrugio, with many imbracinges, and louing kiſſes enterchangeablie giuen betwixt them, to both their comfortes, deſiring pardon of her Lord whome ſhe was loth to offend, ſhee leaueth him with this hope, his courteſie ſhould be remembred: ſo bidding him ad

Ah Andrugio, ſweete Lord Andrugio, yet vlab not Suſania, let thy loue hang at thy heartes bottome, not at thy lippes brimme: thinges vntold are vndone, golde boyleth beſt where it bubleth leaſt. Yea but the flame preſſed down, it inforceth ſmoke: Loue that is ſecretly kept, conſumes in ſorrow, and the fire of fancie raked vp in ſilence, will both fire the ſences, and ſhrinke the ſinewes. Ah but Suſania, the Griphen neuer ſpreadeth his winges in the ſunne, hauing anie ſicke fethers, and a mayden ſnarde in loue doth ſhame to bewray the ſame: what then ſhall Suſania liue, and loſe her beloued to whome ſhe is ſo deare, as his faithfull wordes, with piteous ſighes, bewrayeth? yea, but the Crockidell ſingeth moſte ſweeteſt when he meaneth moſt ſubtiltie: the Scorpyon biteth moſte venomous, when he is leaſt ſuſpected: and may not Andrugio, thinke I, put a diſſembling viſard vppon his fayre face? But ſuſpitious girle, what cauſe haſt thou, to imagine anie ſuch thought of him, whoſe othes, made in the ſight of heauen and the Gods confirme his trueth. Bluſh therefore Suſania, at thy folly, and take heede in time, ſuppreſſe that fancie that maintaines this affection, for litle ſparkes may proue great flames, and ſmall twigges growe to tall Cedars. Loue is a Lord, who like an ambitious Caeſar, that is graunted a part, reſteth not till hee dangereth the whol poſſeſſiō. Knoweſt thou not yt to loue, is to liue in loſſe. Remember Suſania, men be ſubtill, and full of deceipt, Theſeus was falſe, and Demophon faultie, elſe had Ariadne bene fortunate in her loue, and Phillis happie: but what then, becauſe ſome were faultie, is none firme? pauſe there Suſania, though ſnowe melt, flint is another ſubſtance,

gall is bitter, yet honie pleaſant: therefore meaſure the condition of al men as they be, and conceiue of Andrugio, as of a noble Lord, whoſe wordes ſhewes

               The heauineſſe of the aged duke ſomewhat ouerpaſſed, carefull for his towardly ſonne, aduiſing what is beſt for his welfare, hath determined, for auoyding of ſucceeding dangers, to poſt Elanicus again to the place, from whence he came, and with ſtraight charge, not to ſuffer him to proceede farther in his iourney, which had bene ſo vnfortunate vnto him.
               With this commandement Elanicus is againe departed,

taking ſmall eaſe vntill hee came to the millers houſe, where he thought to haue found Andrugio: but for all his haſt the bird was flowne ere he could returne. Andrugio hauing thorowly debated of his loue with Suſania, is nowe concluded of the matche, ſo that there is a mutuall loue, entered both their heartes, in ſomuch that one of them may not ſorrowe without great griefe to the other, that with much adoe he craueth leaue for a time to goe to Siena: thus hauing obtained his deſire, recompenſing his hoſt for the charge beſtowed, taking leaue of Suſania, his deare beloued, he is departed towards Siena, leauing the poore maiden grceuouſly lamenting his abſence, whome neyther the gentle perſwaſions of the father, nor care of the mother may mittigat ſo effectually was loue in the hart of this ſillie mayden, that neither diſtance of place, nor the threates of the pareutes, whiche were many: coulde any whit preuayle, no there was not one day, houre, nor minute, wherein ſhe did not with great aboundance of teares bewayle the abſence of her Andrugio, in this ſort.
               Ah Andrugio, ſweete Andrugio, let theſe droppes of lukewarme teares ſhed from the ſpring of myne ouerburdened heart, be meſſengers of my loue, and let my woefull playninges ſhew the ſorrow of thy poore Suſania, Ah Andrugio thy loue hath pearced the fort of my true loue, and by pitying thee, am I my ſelfe caught in that ſnare, which I feare hath ſo f

               All the ſpeeches Elanicus could vſe, was bootleſſe, neither was his counſell regarded more, then of a childe which hath no vnderſtanding. So bent was this colt to take his race for a time, and therefore beſought Elanicus to perſiſt

from perſwading him farther, for he was reſolued not to returne ſuddainely, if all the kingdomes of the earth lay thereon.

               But yet abſence, which is the greateſt enemie to his former deſires, being ſo far ſundred from his Suſania, hath not power to put her out of minde, but euer in the midſt of his mirth would he call to mind his deare loue, and often with a ſigh rehearſe her name, ſaying, Suſania, ſweete and conſtant Suſania. So often he vſed this, ſo that in the end Galeſtina deſirous to knowe what dame ſhee was of whom by day he talked ſo much, and in the night dreamed of, was ſo unportunate on him, as hee might not hide the flame no longer, of which ſo greate ſmoake was ſeene, and therefore Galaſtina brake with him on this maner and faſhion.
               
                  Andrugio, now my ſecond ſelfe, whoſe welfare I eſteeme

as mine owne, and according to the dutie of a friend, regard thy friendſhip as my life.
               I haue noted euer ſince thy comming to Siena, amongſt all thy myrth, how ſuddainly it hath bene ouerſhadow

                  d with ſighes and fantaſticall ſpeeches tending to loue, as thy paſſion deſcribeth: If it be ſo my Andrugio, thou art entered into the moſt intricate labormth that can be, and ſuch as exceede the capacitie of men to conceiue, ſuch a worme is it as I greatly feare thy health: yea, and without content ſhortly thy life. For doubtleſſe to loue is not tollerable eſpecially, where the loue is abſent. Beſides, it hath manye defectes, as if thy loue be ſctled on a Dame full of diſdaine, who regardeth thee not. Yf ſhee be poorer then thy degree doth require, then is ſhe loth ſome to thy kindred, how pleaſing ſoeuer ſhe be to thee. Loue they ſay is a commander, and of the common people tearmed a God, & honored with glorious tytles, yea, ſome are ſo beſotted in planting their loue, that they reape for their beſt fruit endleſſe miſery, or preuent it by vntimely death, from which the Gods preſerue thee my Andrugio.
               
               But ſweet friend, if thou wilt be aduiſed by him who is as deere in reſpect as mine owne heart, liſten as litle to Venus allurements, as I doo to Cupids flateries, ſo ſhalt thou haue no cauſe to ſay the Gods be vniuſt, nor women cruell: for I thinke of Loue, as Gnato the Greeke did, who was woont to ſay, that of all plagues wherewith mortall men are aff

                  iced, loue was the greateſt, for that they earneſtlye deſired that for their comfort, which they founde their mortall death.
               
                  Andrugio hauing liſtened to Galaſtina his oratiō could not well tell how to digeſt his ſpeech, yet after a ſmall pauſe taken, anſwered.
               Why Galaſtina, dooſt thau count it madneſſe to loue, or him beſotted that yeeldeth vnto affection: Knoweſt thou not or art thou ſo fond as not to know, that Loue is deuine, and can command by his power? Who ſubdued the heartes

               In faith no (quoth Galaſtina) for I count him moſt vnhappie which is in loue moſt happie.
               Why then Galaſtina, thou thinkeſt him vnhappie that loueth.
               Orels (quoth he) I ſhould thinke amiſſe. Should I thinke him happie, which for one penny of coyne ceceyued at his neede, ſhall lie ſhut vp in priſon all dayes of his life? Or for one dramme of proſperitie, reapeth a whole pounde of miſerie? Shall I eſteeme him happie in loue, whoſe golden gaine prooues leaden griefe? No, that is neither pleaſure which is interlaced with paine, nor that happines which turnes to loſſe.
               Why then Galaſtina (quoth Andrugio) dooſt thou thus blaſpheme againſt Cupid and his ſweete mother? and eſteemeſt thou ſo lightlie of loue, which is ſo great a commander.?
               Becauſe (quoth hee) it is Loue, and is ſuch a poyſon, which infecting the mindes of men, entreth as pleaſant as Nectar the drinke of the Gods, but prooueth more vytter than the ioyce of wormewood: for as the Mermayde bewitcheth hearers with her ſweete muſike, vntill they be iulled aſleepe therewith, and ſo they fall into ſome danger. ſo amorous louers haue their ſences beſotted with the franticke paſſions of this Idoll Loue, that they account not themſelues happie, but in their moſt vnhappines, being at moſt eaſe in their diſquiet: at greateſt reſt when they are moſt troubled, ſeeking their pleaſure in care, hunting continually after that, that bringeth endles harme and deſtruction vnto them, as I haue many examples

                  Dauid and Sampſon, in holy writ, Hercules, and Leander in prophane hiſtories, and many more which I omit, wiſhing thee, my good Andrugio (if thou deſire the fauour of ſo poore a friend as my ſelfe and thine owne quiet) to perſiſt from loue otherwiſe, it will breede thy confuſion.
               This is your harſh ſenſure Galeſtina: but die not herein neither ſtand long vpon thoſe tearmes, for if you doe, 
                     Ʋenus is angry at your blaſphemie, will endite you as an hereticke, both to nature and her ſelfe, and ſo plant you one day, for you-diſdaine in loue, as you ſhall haue cauſe to lament, whileſt you leaue your hard fortune: but for this time I am content to giue ouer this argument, leaſt that my follies in prayſing loue, as thou ſayeſt, ſhould make the more earneſt in enuying againſt that ſweete goddeſſe, & ſo cauſe thy puniſhmentes to fall the ſooner. For Ladies by kinde, the more they are grieued, the ſooner they ſeeke reuenge of their enemie, of which number Venus accompteth the one to her Godhead.
               My ſpeeches, Andrugio, is no more then my heart thinketh, as ſhould be apparant, if that foule goddeſſe (as thou tearmoſt her) were preſent: for I doubt leaſt her foreces in loue, to inflict me with hauing alwaies reaſon, which ſhalbe of force ſufficient to expell from my heart, that franticke humour loue, in deſpight of the goddeſſe, and her blind ſonne. But leaſt we being friends become focs thorow this ſound argument, we will for this time ceaſe our parly.
               The fire of loue, raked in the heart of Andrugio, began now to flame, inſomuch that his onely care was how to attaine the ſight of his beloued Suſania, as well to ſatiſfie at full his minde, which often doubted of her welfare, as alſo to participate with her, in familiaritie.
               Wherefore, after many determinations, which way he might with moſte credite accompliſhe the ſame: thorowly now reſolued, without taking leaue of his friend Galaſtina or acquainting other with his pretence, hearing of a ſmall

                  rke, which was readie to paſſe from Siena neere where

his loue ſoiourned, he ſecretly enbarqueth him for the ſame iourney. But ſee howe this cruell enemie fortune enuying the towardneſſe of this braue Gentleman, cammaunding Eolus as her vaſſaile, when as this barke was mid ſeas, of the port of his deſire, pleaſantly cutting the ſiluer waues with a gentle gale, and ech man for his recreation betakes himſelfe vnto thoſe paſtimes, beſt him liked, for the beguiling of time, ſodamly might they heare a grecuous bluſtring of winde, which came of a mayne tearing ye waues before it, in which cruel tempeſt, ye ſplit of their maine ſaile, ſtrooke ouer boord their maine maſt, and with much adoe by the prouidence of him that preſerueth all, and the good induſtrie of their comfortable maiſter, they eſcaped the danger of drowning. A whole night thus ſpent in meditation to God for their deliuerie, no ſooner-came the dawning of the day, when their watche eſpied a ſaile, and called vnto the companie for ioy, hoping of ſome comfort, they man'd their ſhip eche one cenſuring what the ſhippe ſhould be: at length they might perceaue, though a farre off, her ordinance all made readie and put out, as if ſhee were preſently minded to fight, this beeing perceaued, the maiſter called his companie togither, acquainting him what he thought, and beſought their counſels in the cauſe if neede ſhould be, whether they ſhould fight, or yeald vnto their mercy. Theſe ſpeeches of the maiſters appalled wonderouſly the companie, ſo that ſodainly they might not anſwere to his demand: At length Andrugio, as one ſhewing by outward ſignes, the nobleneſſe of his heart, when hee had long expected the anſweres of the companie, began to ſay.
               Louing maiſter, whoſe courage ſheweth you to be a man able to gouerne your charge, in whome nowe vnder God dependeth our welfare, or receiue what danger ſoeuer happen, God and your helpe withall, we will be partakers with you: if they be friendes, let vs intreate their fauour, for our reliefe in this extremitie, for that we need it, if they contrary to our expectation abuſe vs, euerie man reſolue to

An honourable death is alwaies to bee preferred before an ignominious life: reſolue therfore with me, & maiſter, whoſe charge we are all vnder God, ſweare euerie man to that is ſayd, ſo ſhall we be ſure euery man for himſelfe, to performe what you pretend.
               Then maiſter noting the courage of Andrugio, whoſe feminine face ſhewed him fitter for a chamber, then a field, commended highly his forwardneſſe, imagining with him ſelfe, that albeit he tooke not vppon him the worthineſſe of his birth, nor claimed the place fitting his degree, yet doubtleſſe was deſcended of ſome noble progeme. And in quitall of his valour ſhowne, to make him ad more courage to his inuincible heart, he elected him their captaine, commanding all the companie to vſe him accordingly, and to be ruled by his directions, of whome hee was perſwaded to be valiant, diſcreete, and well gouerned.
               
                  Andrugio called to this honour, bethought him of hys charge, which vnwillingly hee had receaued by the importance of the maiſter & his companie, yet as the ſhortneſſe of time would permit him, gaue directions more fitter for an olde captaine, then a noueſſe following the counſell of ſuch antient ſouldiers, which he had red, to the great admiration of his companie, and incouragement of them all.
               By this time their enemies, (as they proued to be) were within hayling, where a couple of deſperate villaines, not regarding the miſeries of thoſe diſtreſſed creatures, whoſe ſhip they ſaw ſo beaten with fortimes ſtormes, in the top of their ſhip waued thē with their bright ſworde amain, their Trumpets ſounding likewiſe deſtance vnto them, bearing ſtill vppon this diſtreſſed companie which were not a little greeued to ſee that offered vnto them, fearing greatly that which after happened.

               The reporter of this newes had ſkarſly finiſhed his tale, when furiouſly and in great rage they commaunded Andrugio and his friendes to be brought vnto them: the miſcreantes de
                     •
                  canting the meane while, of ſuch crueltie as they ſhould both receaue.
               No ſoner came theſe vnhappie men before thoſe mercileſſe bloudſuckers, bent to begin their tormentes, they cauſed them to be hoiſted to the yard arme, and ſo drencht

in the ſeas, at which their miſſeries they tooke exceeding delight: By this this time to aggrauat their miſery they had deuiſed to ſtrip them naked, and euery man with a cordes end as they paſſe them, turning round the capſtone to deale ſuch ſtrokes vpon their bare carkaſſes as they could with pitie of heart, either for crueltie of encreaſing their paine, beſtow on them: or of compaſſion fauour them. But the Gods that yeeld comfort in extremite, looking on thoſe afflicted perſons, preſerued them from this puniſhment: For behold, as they were in ſtripping them, they eſpied a fleet of Gallies at ſea, which in the calme made ſuch ſpeede to them as they might not eſcape by any meanes: wherefore they commanded Andrugio with his companion to the bilbowes, & themſelues to determine for defence againſt their enemies, whom they might eaſily perceiue, now pretending to haue ſome ſaieng to them, and to repay their bloody tyrannie vſed, with the like.
               Time hath brought thoſe diſcried fleet within litle more then a league, ſo that they might eaſilie diſcerne them to be Gallies belonging to the gouernours of Trypolie, of which place thoſe villaines had wronged many, and therefore their feare began the more to encreaſe, doubting that if they fell into their handes, as they did not know howe to withſtande them, their crueltie vſed to others would be repaied: wherfore like friends that in many miſchiefes had ventured together, they reſolutely determine to die and liue together, and ſo preparing themſelues with thoſe fewe, Andrugio had lift them, to be in readineſſe, ordering their fightes with the beſt pollicie they could: they ſcantly had finiſhed what they would haue done, when a cannon ſhot comming frō one of thoſe Gallies, ſtroke their maine maſt by the boord, and ſo beat their ſhip with ſhot, with the loſſe of diuers of their companie, that in vaine they reſiſted: wherefore ſpreading their flag of truce in their miſſen top, They committed themſelues to mercie of thoſe, with whome there is no mercie at all.
               
                  
When the ſmoke of the peeces was cleared, and that they ſaw there came no more ſhot from the ſhip thinking before they had loſt her: eſpying their ſlag of truce, the Captaine of the Viz-admyrall commanded the Helmſ-man to fal too and boord her, where finding thoſe braue mates that had ſpoiled many, now in this conflict to ſtand as mute as ſilly ſheepe before a woolfe, intreating hardly for their liues which could not be granted them, yet bound backe to backe, they left them lying on the hatches, vntill they had ranſacked the Shippe, ſearching in euerie corner, and tooke the ſpoile.
               VVhere finding our comfortleſſe ANDRVGIO, and his pitifull companion, miſerablie wronged in thoſe yron Fetters, taking them to bee priſoners to thoſe cruell and bloody Pyrates, and ſuch as had bene wronged by them, commaunded that they ſhould be releaſed from their captiuitie, and to be brought before the Admirall, which was preſently done.
               
                  Andrugio for all the tormentes hee had bene afflicted with, could not bee compelled to make himſelf knowen: but being by the Admyrall examined, what he was, and how hee fell into their handes: told him that hee was a paſſenger in a ſmall Barque whom they had ſpoiled both of goodes and men, and that none of his companie remianed aliue, but himſelfe only.
               The Admyrall noting the courage of the prince, commanded that he ſhould be brought with his fellow priſoner aboord his owne Gallie, requiting the crueltie of the reſt as they had deſerued: for beeing bound backe to backe, heaued ouerboord, ending their liues in blood as they had liued, Hauing taken ſuch ſpoiles as thoſe Pyrates had aboord, they ſ

               Hauing thus ſome leyſure to debate of thinges paſſed, the Generall called to minde Andrugio and his mate, who were not

                   grieued to thinke what miſcrie they were

like to come to being faln into the hands of thoſe mercileſſe and vnhallowed people of whome there was no hope of fauour at all.
               As the generall commanded, they were brought before him, of whome he diligently inquired of what countrey they were, and how they chanced to their handes, who kept them captiue. To whome Andrugio hoping of fauour, declared that he was borne in the Duke of Saxons country and being a ſtudent in the vniuerſitie of C

into the which entered no maner of light, where hee ſorrowed and ſighed moſte lamentably, exclayming on fortune, and curſing the time wherein he firſt made motion of parting from his princely father, which found him dearer then his own life. Thus foure moneths (too long a time for people in ſuche extremitie) paſſed in ſerable Andrugio in moſt grieuous aduerſitie, hauing ſcarſe clothes to hide his ſecretes of nature, and no other ſuſtinance, but the great boulting of barly meale, mingled with water, which was not all times of the beſt, yet in the midſt of all whiche miſerie, Cupid a confederate, with his ſworne foe fortune, began to remoue his thoughts with that freſh remembrance, of his deareſt and moſt beloued friend Suſania, for whoſe ſake in going to ſee her, more dearer then his life vnto him, his miſerie began: the remembrances of whome in the extreameſt anguiſhe of his miſerie, bredde ſuche ſweete comfort, that there was no houre, yea ſleeping or waking wherin he ceaſed to call vpon the name of his deare miſtres and comforte of his life Suſania, ſometime exclaiming on fortune for her crueltie againſt him, other while, making his oriſons, to Venus for fauour, that by the vertue of her god-head, ſhe might ſo worke with her ſonne Cupid, yt where it ſhould pleaſe the giuer of all comforte to free him from that captiuitie, he might once inioy the ſight of his ſo long deſired Suſania.
               
               Lo thus paſſing his miſerie in the moſt patienteſt fort that hee might, the omnipotent Creator to ſhewe thereby his glorie, and to make Andrugio feele the fauour of his ſweete and gratious hand, when this filthie dungion, the place of his miſerable lodge, had ſo weakened his corpes, with ſhort diet, and moſte lothſome funels, and that paſt hope of euer ſeeing anie creature, but the barbarous hard hearted and pittileſſe villaine his iaylour, loe there, behold how ſweete a comforte on the ſodaine vnexpected vnto him happened.

               But after this moſte grieuous ſtorme, putting into the port of Tripolia. They had no ſooner anchored their ſhippes, but preſently they diſpatched ambaſſadors to the gouernour, making themſelues knowne vnto him, with intreatie, for the princes, who hardly brooking her laſt danger, ſurpriſed with the feare of death, and weake with their long beating at ſea, was verie euill at eaſe, for whom their deſire was, to haue entertainement.
               This knowne to the gouernour, no leſſe courteſie, then honourable, he aſſembling the chiefeſt captaines, & Burgurs of the Citie, and with their moſte conuenient ſpeede prepared themſelues towardes that place of the harbour where this wearie beaten ſhippe anchored, when ſhewing themſelues on the ſhoare in the ſumptuous maner they could vppon ſo ſhort warning, they diſpatch

                   Embaſſadours to the kinges, willing hun to declare their pleaſures vnto them in this ſorte.
               That whereas they had ſo hardly eſcaped the danger of ſhipwracke, and by Gods prouidence vnexpected of them, had fortuned into that place, a Citie farre vnable to giue ſuch entertainement, as there eſtates required, yet howe welcome they were vnto them, as vnto the ſubiects of their gracious ſoueraigne, and their highneſſe friendes to their vtmoſt power it ſhould be ſhowne. And farther, that they being principall vnder their ſoueraigne, attended with reuerend duetie their highneſſe comming to the ſhoare, to conduct them vnto their lodginges, which in the beſt maner was preparing for their entertainement.
               When the Embaſſadour had declared this aunſwere

from the gouernour. The two kinges verie glad thereof, expected the ſame with thankes: and giuing order for the landing of their traine, with ſuch neceſſaries as was abord of prouiſion, they beſought the princes to be readie with them, to goe a ſhoare, where theſe honourable and worſhipfull gouernours of the ſaide Citie, attended their comming, with all their ladies in their coaches, to welcome the Princes, at whoſe meeting, the courteous welcomes, with the fauourable thanks returned from theſe princes, I omit: but with great honour and welcomes from all eſtates, as well the poore as the beſt, they were conueyed to their lodging, which was in the kinges owne pallace within the walles of the ſame Citie, where repoſing themſelues, I leaue them to their ſolace for a time.
               When theſe noble princes, had ouer paſſed their weary toyle and hard trauaile without ſome eaſe taking, then began the nobles of this Citie, to deuiſe ſome paſtimes, as well to recreat their mindes, which were giuen to melancholicke for loſſe of their ſhippes, of whome they heard no newes: amongeſt which, the captaines gathering theyr men togither, rigged and furniſhed a doſen gallyes and pinnaſſes to the ſea, with intent to ſhewe their maner of fight and ſea ſkirmiſhes, to which ſeruices, was Andrugio and his fellow pyrate called, to take their places at an ores end, as before they had done.
               When all thinges was prouided for this paſtune, the princes hauing taken place to beholde the ſame: in whiche fight after a little time, the gally wherein Andrugio was, being by another taken, his captaine, aſwell to ſhewe what extremitte they vſed to thoſe they vanquiſhed, as to grieue the body of Andrugio, cauſed him to be ſtripped, and moſt greeuouſly to be whipped, and after, by the armes with two great waites at his toes, hanging, to be drawne vp to the yard arme, where, when he had hanged, that all men pitied him ſauing his mercileſſe captaine, at the crie of the people was at length let downe. But to agrauate ſtill his extreame

griefe and torment of body: the Captaine (as one bent to ſeeke his vtter deſtruction, prouided yet a more greater torment both bytter and cruell: for loe, when time had brought their paſtimes to end, This mercileſſe tormenting Captaine, inuited all the Captaines to a banquet aboord his Gallie: at the end whereof, he cauſed Andrugio to be caſed in the raw hide of a new ſlaine woolfe, which with the ſhipdogges from euery Gally, baited him beaſtlike, in ſuch maner, that they had like to haue wearied him, ſometimes tearing his armes and legges, otherwhile the other partes of his bodie, which crueltie of the dogges, vexing poore Andrugio, bred ſuch content to the barbarous villaine, that his heart was more ioyed with the ſight thereof, than if hee had receiued a noble victorie againſt his enemies: ſuch deadly hatred had the cruell tyrant conceiued againſt Andrugio.
               
               At this banquet there chanced to bee a noble man of the traine of the Princeſſe Gurdania, whoſe heart pitieng Andrugio ſo much that he could not endure the ſight of his extremities: but turning his head from that which the barbarous people tooke delight in, he ſecretly enquyred what hee was that was ſo hardly vſed aboue the reſt of thoſe ſlaues. theſe queſtions of the noble man was demanded by chance of ye pyrate before taken with Andrugio, who being a faire welſpoken man, and of good demeanor, recounted at large vnto this noble man Andrugio his tormentes, & beſought him, that as he was a gentleman, to take compaſſion on his miſerie, and buy him for money, or by ſome other meanes to worke his deliuerie: for that if he remained amongſt them, this would euery day be their vſe vntill God by death ſhal thinke good to end his ſorrowes, albeit hee was in his Countrie a Gentleman of good name and honorable reputation.
               The noble man mooued with pitie and compaſſion at the Pyrates ruthfull tale, thought euery minute of an hower a day, vntill he might come to the preſence of thoſe two

kinges and the Princeſſe, which he might not do that night: Wherefore in the morning awaiting earneſtly to bring his deſire to effect, he was brought before them, vnto whom he recounted the grieuous ſight he had ſeene, and how much it troubled his minde, and grieued his heart to thinke that euer Chriſtian ſhould endure ſuch miſerie. VVhere, in the moſt earneſt manner that hee coulde, beſought the Princeſſe and the Kinges of Denmarke and Swethland to procure his freedome, either by intreatie, or for ranſome, at his charge, to what ſomme ſoeuer it amounted.
               The princes hearing this dolefull diſcourſe, mooued to pitie his miſerie, ſent for the gouernour, and beſought him, that as their welcomes had bene great, and their entertainment exceeding, ſo they might craue his friendſhip in a ſuit they had to impart vnto him.
               The Gouernour glad to content thoſe princes with all the fauours he might, did not only by his word aſſure what they deſired, but deepely ſware they ſhoulde obtaine what they craued: holding himſelfe highlie in their fauour, that they would demaund any thing that lay in him to performe, beſeeching to know what their ſuit was.
               The princeſſe thanking him for his kindneſſe, and fauor, told him that their ſuit was for the libertie of a ſlaue, a poor man, and what ranſome hee would demaund, he ſhould haue with thankes.
               My gracious Lords (quoth the Gouernour) not one, but all the priſoners and ſlaues in this place ſhall bee at your highnes command: and therefore I humblie beſeech you to let me knowe his Captaines name, and the perſon, and hee ſhall preſently be ſent for.
               The noble man whoſe deſire was to haue Andrugio his libertie, very glad to heare his ſuite growe to ſo good effect, gaue thankes to the gouernour, deſcribing vnto him what he was, and in what Gally, but his name he could not remember, which by the eſpeciall notes giuen, was well knowen vnto the Gouernour, who with all ſpeed diſpatched

one of his ſeruantes for Andrugio, commanding that hee ſhould be brought vnto his lodging, which preſently was accompliſhed. Whom when the gouernour ſaw, he demaunded of what calling and countrey he was, and how long hee had ſerued in their Gallies. To whom Andrugio anſwered: by byrth (noble Lord) I am a Saxon, of reputation a Gentleman, and paſſing the ſeas, was moſt vnfortunatelye taken priſoner by the Fleete of Gallies that laſt ſerued againſt the king of Spaines forces. This fourteene moneths haue I endured moſt miſerable ſeruitude and grieuous puniſhmentes by my vnmercifull and rigorous Captaines-command.
               VVhen the Gonerall had heard him, commaunded his man that he ſhould be cloathed in a faire ſuite of apparell of his owne, and ſo preſented him to the Princeſſe, vnto whō he was verie acceptable:
               Thus when Andrugio by the appointment of the Gods had remained a while at libertie, and that the princes had well repoſed themſelues, prouiſion was made for their departure vnto the Barbarian King, of whome they were expected long, by reaſon of ſome of their Fleet arriuing in his countrie. all things being ready for them, a faire gale blowing, they take their leaues of the Gouernour, whome they reward with great and bountifull preſentes, with much courteſie and thankes for their royall entertainment, the which they vowed ſhould neuer be forgotten. And ſo bidding them farewell they imbarqued themſelues for their pretended iourney, with whom alſo departed Andrugio, attending vppon the Lord Ieronymy, who had releaſed him.
               Thus by the prouidēce of the hieſt, Andrugio was from the miſerie he endured deliuered, and in great fauour of the Lord Ieronymy his maiſter, vnto whoſe gouernment hee committed all his affaires, who ſo well behaued him ſelfe, that he was in great account of his Lord and louing maiſter.
               
                  
Their buſineſſe and honorable mariage of the Emperours daughter accompliſhed, and the kinges with their traines ſafely retourned to their owne countrie, Andrugio highlie in fauour of his Lord, gained ſo the loue of all the people, that none of the retinue of his Lord, was helde in ſuch account of all eſtates, as well of Nobles and Gentlemen of the countrie, as the inferiour ſort. It fortuned, this Lord Ieronymie hauing one onely ſiſter, wiſe, beautifull, and well gouerned, hearing ſuch generall commendation of Andrugio, and amongſt the reſt her brother ſo highly to commend him in all places, and at all times, ſo that his common talke was euer to the credite of Andrugio, which noted in the yoong ladie Meſſeliua, (for ſo was ſhe called) her affection began to encreaſe towards him in ſuch wiſe, that from a ſmall ſparke, the fire of fancie began to grow to a great flame, and her chiefe and onely delight was in beholding of her beſt beloued Andrugio: yea, her thoughtes were ſo ſetled vpon him that in the night ſhe dreamed of him, and in the day he was neuer out of her remembrance, in ſo much that this paſſion increaſing, ſhe began to growe into great extremities, euermore deuiſing what meanes ſhe might beſt worke to make her loue knowne vnto him: now caſting this doubt, then another, ſo that in no ſort ſhee might ſettle her thoughtes how to bring her deſires to effect, in ſuch maner as ſhe might be void of ſuſpition to the world, and acquaint Andrugio with her ſecrete loues towardes him, hauing not any friend of familiaritie to bee aduiſed by, but her wayting woman, of whoſe truſt and fidelitie in ſuch a waightie cauſe ſhee was not aſſured of. Yet notwithſtanding arming her ſelfe with hope, the only comfort of the diſtreſſed, ſhe reſolueth with her ſelfe a litle while longer to beare it out, hoping that time and her courteſie vſed towards him, might cauſe him to craue that which ſhe could willingly, and with all her heart offer him.
               
                  Andrugio on the top of his pleaſure, leading a life free

from all incumbrances of body, yet could not forget the loue he bare his Suſania, which howe often he called to minde, the more began his ſorrow: yea ſuch deſire he had to ſee his beſt beloued, that his whole ſtudie and continuall care was how to accompliſh the ſame, in doubt of euerie occaſion that might hinder his determination. Thus betweene doubtfulneſſe, and diſpaire, liued this yoong prince diſcontented, that he tooke no pleaſure in keeping anie kinde of companie at all. Such was his honourable minde, with duetifull allegiance, tied by the lincke of faith vnto his Lord, who had freed him, that he durſt not for feare of deniall, make any requeſt for his fauour therein: and to goe of his freewill, he thought it villanie to requite with ſuch ingratitude, ſo honourable a man, that loued him as his owne. Well ſo long continued thoſe paſſions, abiding ſuch grieuous tormentes of minde, that his liuely collour began to waxe pale and wanne: yea his bloud which was freſh, and well beſeeming, dried, and his bodie growne with continuall griefe into a faine ſickneſſe, inſomuch that his alteration, was noted of all, lamented of many that did know him, but eſpeciallie of the noble Lord Ieronimie, and his ſiſter Meſſalina, who continually noted euerie ſight, and woulde oftentimes demand the cauſe of his ſorrowe, whiche by no meanes they could vſe, he would diſcouer. But Lord Ieronimie, as one carefull of his well doing, woulde neuer be ſatiſfied with ſuch anſweres as Andrugio would giue, nor allow his excuſes for trueth: wherefore taking him one day into the fields of purpoſe to ſolace, they ſpent their time in walking, pleaſantly diſcourſing vntill the Lord Ieronimie comming to a pleaſant medowe, bedecked with natures ornamentes as much as they had ſeene, which viewing, they both cenſured of the bewtie of the field, one commending the delightful ſmell of floures, the other the ſituation of the place, which was moſt excellent, neere vnto the edge of one ſide running a moſt pleaſant chriſtall ſtreame, which bubling ouer, the round Poples gaue a ſweete noyſe to the hearers

vpon the ſide whereof was growing a rowe of moſte exceeding fine poplar trees, which ouerſhadowed the place, as it was moſt pleaſant.
               This place aboue the reſt that they had chanced on, Lord Ieronimie thoſe to ſolace himſelf in, as alſo fit for his purpoſe: wherefore, commanding Andrugio to ſit down by him, like a louing kind Lord hee began to participate with Andrugio, in this wiſe.
               
                  Andrugio, mine owne Andrugio, I haue long ſought fit opportunitie, to haue ſecret conference with thee, and hauing found place and time for the ſame, be not moued, that I growe into thoſe ſpeaches, which I haue to vſe, conſidering that they beſpoken of loue, and not maliciouſly. Firſt my Andrugio, whiche I haue to ſay vnto thee is this, I haue ſince our comming from the mariage of my liege the Emperours daughter, noted many a ſad and heauie countenance in thee, which I knowe argueth a diſcontented mind, proceeding as my cōiecture aſſureth me of loue: now Andrugio, as I freed thee from the bondage of ye turks vnknowne, if there be anie ſuch cauſe, feare not to make it known vnto me. I haue vowed to pleaſure thee al yt I may, ſtand not therfore on niſe tearms, but let me know ye dame whom thou haſt made choyſe of, to gouerne thy affections, and if I ſeeke not all poſſible meanes for thy heartes content, accuſe me euer of diſhonour, and holde me the moſte wretched vile creature on the earth.
               
                  Andrugio hearing this diſcourſe of his Lordes, which he leaſt looked for, could not well on the ſodaine tell how to anſwere, for that he was not aſſured whether he ſpake vpon ſurmiſe, or that he had ſome ſecret knowledge of his loue to Suſania, yet thinking to haſard his credite with Lord Ieronimie, he anſwereth.
               My gracious Lord, what humble thanks my heart rendereth for ſo great fauours, my toonge cannot declare. But gracious Lord, where fortune hath placed an extraordinarie want, their wil ſhal ſupplie the defects of wealth, & loyaltie

performe that whiche my meane abilitie can neuer put in practiſe, The tree that bringeth foorth no fruite, is good for fuell, and ſtones are not to be valued by an outward view, but an inward vertue, Prometheus did conſture wel of the workes of Lycias, and I hope my gratious Lord will not miſconſture the will of Andrugio, but rather, to caſt an eye to my ſecret willingneſſe, then to looke for merites which I cannot manifeſt: what I finde noble Lord by experience, the time and place forbids me to participate leaſt I be accuſed of flatterie, yet what I conceiue, I leaue to your honourable coniecture, which I cannot any way diſcip
                     •
                  er: onely this alwaies accompt, Andrugio is your duetifull and loyall ſeruaunt vntill death, which hee hath vowed by the true band of friendſhip, neuer to violate: Thus finding in my ſelfe, a will that ſhall neuer wauer, a faith vnfained, and a life vowed to perpetuall loyaltie. Hoping that as Protagenes was excuſed for his vnperfect pictures, by doing what he could, ſo alſo ſhall I finde your Lordſhippes fauour, ſince I promiſe the performance of anie thing I may.
               But my good Lord, touching your demand, I beſeeche you thinke thus, that if there were any thing which diſturbed my quiet of heart, I ſhould aboue all, for many conſiderations acquaint your Lordſhip with the ſame, but loue as your Lordſhip cenſured, it is not but as I can beſt conceaue of mine owne griefe, a melancholicke paſſion, naturally proceeding of deſire, to ſee my natiue countrie, my prince and friends to whome it is altogether vnknown what is become of me, whether I liue or reſt with death, Beſides my good Lord, I liue heere a meere ſtranger in high fauour, reaping the benefite of your honourable countenance, more then any man, whiche as I am ſtranger, may make me dread, the ſpight of ſome one or other, enuying your Lordſhips will, when noting my vnworthineſſe, for ſo great benefites, may ſeeke my confuſion▪ Thus my good Lord haue I in the humbleſt maner I may, made

knowne vnto your Lordſhip, the greateſt and of what I ſay, for that it is ſpoken in trueth.
               
                  Andrugio anſwered his Lord, I take thy wordeas a warrant, for what thou ſayeſt, & aſſure thee on my honour, that as thou art a ſtranger, thy welcome is the greater. I neither yet haue deſerued at thy handes ſuche loue as thou profeſſeſt me, but aſſure thee, hee ſhall not liue in bondes of my royaltie, that ſhall enuie Andrugio, or ſeeke to doe him the leaſt wrong which may be offered a man. Therefore ſurceaſe thy heauineſſe, and ſet feare apart, for of a Lord, I wil become a father vnto thee, and a friend vnto thy friends and louers. Time calleth vs nowe homeward, wherefore I will detayne thee no longer.
               
                  Andrugio glad at the heart, his counterfait anſwere was taken for currant, thought himſelfe the happieſt of manie, this communication was ended, and with a better will followed his Lord home then we can imagine, as glad he had eſcaped the ſuſpition of his maiſter, as the ſcholler that feareth beating for his leſſon: but nowe to returne to madam Meliſsina.
               
               This Ladie whoſe heart Cupid hath made a priſoner vnto his dutie, ſought manie times opportunitie to eaſe her griefe, by all the occaſions ſhe could imagine, but none that ſhe durſt attempt for feare: diuers times ſhe determineth one meane, and fully reſolueth to followe it, then the doubt of ſome contrary accident, driueth her into diſpayre, combating thus in the extremities of her heart, deuiſing what was beſt to bring her deſires to effect. Venus ſeeing her ſo firme and conſtant a ſouldier, lending a little ayd to comfort her, prouideth this ſhift. There was attending on a Lady, a neighbour of the Lord Ieronimie, a Gentlewoman in Saxonie borne, with whome, for countries ſake, Andrugio: grewe ſomething familiarly acquainted with this gentlewoman, did Ladie Meliſsina ſeeke alſo to haue familiaritie, and on the ſodaine began to accompanie her Ladie ſo often, that with her repayre, ſhe grewe into great

                  Elenora (for ſo was ſhe named) I haue ſeene thy honeſt kind demeanor as well to ſtraungers as to thy Lady and friendes that prooue thy loue, and of all, of what eſtate or calling foeuer of our owne countrie, I haue for thy good behauiour made choiſe of thee, as of one to whom my hart hath linked her

                  elfe in bond of true friendſhip aboue all other. Yf thou canſt therefore (my ſweete Elenora) thinke but the like of me.

                  Elenora which had receiued great friendſhippe at the handes of this Lady, knowing ſhee was of honour and of great reputation, thought her ſelfe happie to liue in the ſoci
                     •
                  tie of ſo noble a Lady. Yet notwithſtanding the fauour offered, with humble and

                  utifull reuerence as one knowing full well how to behaue her ſelfe, returned this anſwer.
               My honorable Lady, how acceptable your gracious ofter is vnto your ſeruant, I hope your wiſedome will conceiue: far vnwoorthy I am to participate with ſo honorable a Lady in ſuch familiarity as it hath pleaſed you to make offer. But ſeeing it ſtandeth with your fauour to make choiſe of one ſo ſimple as I am, a Gentlewoman of meane parentage, and a ſtraunger borne with all dutie: I commit my ſelfe vnto your Ladiſhips diſpoſition: proteſting that for euer Elenora is and ſhall be the dutifull attendant of Madame meliſsina truely and faithfully to ſerue you in all reuerence, as becommeth ſo noble a lady: to the which by the Gods that framed me, I ſweare.
               
                  
Ynough my Elenora (quoth Maddam Meliſſyna) geue me thy hand to performe thy ſaying, and hereafter leaue to vſe theſe tearmes of reuerence to thy Melyſsina, who hath in friendſhip vnited her ſelfe vnto thee, ſuppoſing the ſhape of Elenora to be tranſformed to Melyſsina, and Meliſsina to Elenora.
               
               And now Elenora, to make proofe of that which I hope to finde in thee, I muſt impart vnto thee, according to my truſt repoſed in thy ſecr

                  ould for euer conceale, as I haue long done from diſcloaſing thereof to any friend whatſoeuer, yet dooth it concerne me neere. To make many words (my Elenora) is but to fill the aire with winde, and ſpend time, which we may hardly doo: for feare thou bee of thy Lady miſſed: and therefore briefy (ſweete Elenora) I loue, yea loue I doo, with the moſt entire affection and deſire of my heart one with whome I knowe thy ſelfe to bee familiar, with whom my ſelfe cannot be acquainted yet I haue offered many courteſies, and offers of friendſhyp, which hee regardeth not. This is the ſomme I haue to ſay, onely I omit his name vntill I heare thy anſwere.
               
                  Elenora ſeeing by her countenance that ſhe meant what ſhe ſaid, ſtriken in a dumpe, began to ſtudie an anſwere, for for feare her raſh proffer might breede cauſe of repentance, that ſhee had a louer of her own, whome ſhee was loth to ſpare to Madam Meliſsina, although ſhe loued her well, yet after a pauſe taken, hazarding her word, ſhe vowed deuoutly to conceale whatſoeuer ſhould be vttered, and with her beſt counſell and greateſt paines labour to bring her deſire to effect.
               
                  Meliſsina hauing made ſure worke with Elenora, was halfe comforted, and without any more proteſtations, told her, that Andrugio a ſeruant to the Lord Ieronymie, her

               Thankes (Elenora) for this comfort, wherewith thou haſt indewed my heart with ſuch a ſimpany of ioy, as I feel the ſweetneſſe thereof already diſpearſed throwout euery member of my body. Time, an enemy to friendes ouer ſtippeth ſo ſuddainly, that we muſt needes part for feare thou be miſſed: wherefore we will for this time ceaſe our parly not doubting but that thou wilt remember me, and ſo departed Elenora to the houſe of her Lady, and Madam melyſsina to her lodging.
               
                  Andiugio according to his accuſtomed maner, preſently after ſupper comming to ſee his countriwoman, whome he found in a great ſtudie, as one (as it might ſeeme) careful of that ſhe had vnder taken: which gaue Andrugio cauſe to demaund the reaſon of her heauiues, which ſhe manye

wayes excuſed. But Andrugio meaſuring her fancies by his owne deſires, in ieſt told her ſhe was in loue. Entering thus into communication, Good countriman (quoth Elenora) if your experience in Loue-cauſes be ſuch, that you can conceiue by outward apparance, what the heart deſireth, be not mooued, nor any thing diſpleaſed, if vnder benedicite I demaund with what Lady, Gentlewoman, or other you be your ſelfe in loue: Bluſh not man (quoth Elenora) for your wan lookes, your heauie ſighes, and your griefe by outward apparance is ſuch, that I haue noted in you a gret alteration ſince your comming home with my lord Ieronymie, which doubtleſſe argueth you are in loue. Wherefore (Andrugio) if thou be, feare not to diſcloſe it vnto me, for a womans helpe may ſtand in ſuch a cauſe in more ſteed then the counſell of an experienced wiſe man: and for my part I vow vnto thee by the honour I owe to Diana, and by all ſuch holy rites as become a virgine, if either my paines or counſell may auaile thee, thou ſhalt

               I am very glad countriwoman, anſwered Andrugio that my comming hath remooued your melancholike humour, and made you thus pleaſant, but that I loue as thou ſuppoſeſt, I neuer did, nor neuer meane to do, becauſe that experience by others hath taught me to eſchew that hayte, which entering pleaſantly, will confound the intrals and conſume the he art, if that preſent remedie be not miniſtred in time by their deſired Ladies, Therfore knowing the pertill, I will as I haue done, auoid that miſchiefe, which may breed my confuſion.
               Well (quoth Elenora) I may take thy word, but how I beleeue thy weake anſwere I leaue to report, for that I knowe there is no creature liuing, who dooth not make eſpeciall choiſe of one, with whom they participate aboue al other, and to loue (I know) is incident both to men and women, by which I aſſure me Andrugio, thou dooſt loue, denie

                   thou denie thy loue to me, that ſo friendly demanded to knowe thy choyſe, at my firſt comming, thy countenance ſhewing it ſo plaine: for behold in thy forehead written that worde that Paris wrote euer in the ſight of his beloued Helena, (I loue) which beeing apparant, why ſhouldeſt thou denie it.
               Well Andrugio, it is folly for women, whoſe wittes be weake, to ſtand reaſoning with men, whoſe ſtudies in rethoricke and logicke may perſwade & deſwade ſuch fooles as my ſelf, to what (in honeſt wiſe) they liſt, but were maddam Meliſsina here, you could not carrie it ſo away. It is nowe but early nightes, and my Lord and Lady in bed, wherefore good countriman, if thy buſineſſe be not great, accompanie me to the Lady Meliſsinaes lodging, who I know, will bid you welcome, and for my ſake, to whome I am bound, & would faine acquaint thee wt her. Be not therefore ſo ſtrange, God may prouide for thee in time, that as the deſertes hath wo

                  Elenora, glad that ſhee had made this entermedling to the Ladies motion, tooke him at his worde, and conducteth him vnto her lodging, whome they found readie to bed, that hearing the voyce of Elenora, commanded her waiting woman to open the dore, Meliſsina ſeeing her beloued enter with her, was put to ſuch an non plus, as ſhe could not well tell what to ſay, that at laſt, remoued

from her ſtudie, ſhe bad him moſt heartily welcome, and demaunded the cauſe of Elenors comming, on ſuch a ſodaine: To who

                  e ſaid Elenora, the trueth is maddam, that hauing this good companie of my countriman, and my leiſure fitting, too vntimely yet to goe to bed, I intreated him to bring me hither, whither I truſt he is welcome.
               
                  Elenora, quoth Meliſsina, he is in trueth welcome, for thy ſake, as alſo his owne, and for that my Lord and brother, doth ſo much fauour him as I know he doth, if it ſhall pleaſe him in anie ſorte to vſe my friendſhip, for his better preferment to my brother, or any one, he ſhall finde me readie: and good Andrugio, be no ſtranger vnto me, for of my honour, the honeſt care you haue of the charge my Lord hath committed vnto you, hath gained you credite with your Lord, and fauour of his friendes, amongeſt which Meliſsina, though ſhe ſpeake leaſt for your benefite, yet will not be the laſt, make triall where you pleaſe.
               The vndeſerued fauours, I haue found at my honourable Lordes handes, with your Ladiſhips courteſies, poore Andrugio knoweth not anie way howe to deſerue, but in trueth and loyaltie, to whiche in the moſt humbleſt maner, I binde me ſo long as I ſhall inioy breath, and if your Ladyſhip ſhall pleaſe to command Andrugio, my readineſſe to your ſeruice ſhall ſhew my zeale, in performing the ſame.

him another ſpurne, for loe, a gentleman of the Lord Ieronimie, who bare ſecret loue vnto maddam Meliſsina albeit he neuer durſt reueale the ſame, yet continually would he walke at leaſt two or three houres in the euening, neere about the lodging of his beloued Ladie, by which meanes, he chanced oftentimes to eſpie Andrugio, comming late from the Ladies lodging, which perceaued & noted, growing iealous of his often repaice there, hee ſought manie waies to acquaint his Lord with the ſame, but could not deuiſe anie fit meanes to the accompliſhing of the ſame, enuying ſtill in his heart Andrugio. This gentleman amongſt others his companiōs, hauing ſpente their time in riotous drinking, and carouſing, he began to accuſe Andrugio of villany, ſaying, that there was no night eſcaped, wherein Andrugio vſed not in moſte vile and diſhoneſt maner, the bodie of madam Meliſsina. This talke noted of diuers, in the morning one enuying Andrugioes happineſſe more then the reſt, greeuing that a ſtranger ſhould haue that countenance vnder their Lord, came vnto this foreſayd gentleman, and charged him with his ſpeeches, vſed agaynſt madam Meliſsina, which he affirmed, whereupon finding as they thought, time to thruſt him from their Lordes fauour, they determined to accuſe him of the crime, & taking no reſpect on their deuiſe, they preſently ſought the Lord Ieronymie vnto whoſe preſence being come, kneeling on their knees, they humblie beſought his honour, to pardon them, for what they had to ſay. Ieronymie amaſed at this ſodaine motion, deſirous to knowe their mindes, bad them ſay on.

ſiſter madam Meliſsina. This my good Lord, I ſpeake not of any euill will to the man, nor enuiie to the Lady, but in trueth and dutie to your Lordſhip, for that I haue ſeene oftentimes my ſelfe, his repayre to her: and once ſuſpecting the ſame, I followed him, when peering in at her chamber window, I ſaw thē in moſt vnlawfull ſort together on her bed, her mayden beeing ſent of purpoſe away, to my great griefe, knowing well by the fauours you haue done that vnthankfull Andrugio.
               
               
                  Ieronimie could ſcarſe forbear to heare his tale to end, ſo greeued at the heart was he at their ſpeeches, but diſſembling the ſame in the beſt ſort he could, thanked them for their good wil, and bad them depart. Ieronimie iealous of what he had heard, could not be quiet, vntill he did know the effect of what they had tolde, and therfore determining with himſelfe to ſee the euent of it, pretended to watch that night diſguiſed, when hee came thither, and hee departed, ſupper ended, and euery man departing his way, Ieronimie awayted his time, and ſcarſly went out of the houſe, diſguiſed in ſuch ſorce that hee that had knowne him well, might haue bene miſtaken, ſecretly ambuſhing himſelfe, to ſee Andrugio his comming.
               Not long had he ſtayd, but Andrugio, with Elenora, as was their vſe came togither, and entered the houſe, which whē he ſaw, blame him not tobe malecōtent, fearing by this vnhappie beginning, ye euil euent of the reſt yet vnquiet as hee was, perſwaded himſelfe as well as he could, thinking, that being both there, no further matter at that time could happen, yet would hee ſee his returne, wayting thus two houres, and ſomething more. Andrugio and the Ladie playing a game at ch
                     •
                  ſtes, which they were loth to giue ouer without victorie on the one ſide, Elenora hauing more haſt then the reſt, deſired madam Meliſsina to lend her mayd to accompanie her, which ſhe did, when Ieronimie ſaw this, think nowe Lordinges, how
                     •
                   intollerable it was to him, albeit no defartes of either part, but wrong

ſuppoſitions of an enuious perſon? Ieronimie ſeeing this, might no longer forbeare their preſence, but with ſpeed entered the houſe and entering the chamber wher they plaid: (checke) quoth Andrugio to the Ladie, which Ieronimie hearing, anſwered, I vulaine, and that checke ſhall coſt thy life, miſcreant and vngratefull viſlaine as thou art, tell mee for which good fauour yt I haue done thee, haſt thou ſought the confuſion of me and mine? I will not now ſtand to reaſon the cauſe with thee, but goe with me. As for thee

                  e, that haſt yeelded thy body as a companion to this raſcal, I wil take ſuch order as thy hot deſies ſhal bee made coole inough. Thus furiouſly hailing Andrugio out of the chamber, he departed, commiting him to the cuſtody of the Goaler, where bewailing this ſuddaine chance, not knowing any cauſe why, we leaue him.
               Maddam meliſsina whome the griefe of this had ouerwhelmed, was ſo ſurpriſed with the ſame, that ſhe fel into a trance, in which extremity, her maiden which went with Elenora returning found her, wondring at this ſuddain alteration, but left her not without calling help, and with al poſſible means ſought to bring her to life: but in vain they ſtriue, for ſhe hath paid her due to death, whom al the labour they might vſe preuailed not to call againe. When they ſaw no remedy, the maide preſently diſpatched a meſſenger to Ieronymy, enforming him what was happened. But careleſſe, he thinking it had bene ſome pollicie of the Lady to drawe him thether, that by intreatie ſhee might craue grace at his hands for her friend, would not giue credite to it: But rewarding the meſſenger with bitter words, reſted all night as he might. In the morning early pretending to let his ſiſter know his mind, and how hardly he brooked her laſciuious life, which ſhe ſpent in formcation with Andrugio, he repared to her chamber, wher entring the ſame, he ſaw ye breath leſſe tronke of the Lady lieng on the ruſhes, and her maide with others in teares bitterly bewailing the vntimely death of her, whom for her curteſie they loued deerely.
               
                  
This ſight of Ieronymie, was litle pleaſing, at which maugre his heart he could not refrain the ſhedding of tears but ſtanding mute a long time, as one in a trance, on the ſuddaine comming to himſelfe, he inquyred the cauſe of her death, and how it came to paſſe, whereof none in the companie could aduertiſe him, wherefore accuſing his owne follies and light beleefe, hee ſuppoſed that his bytter wordes, vſed in diſgrace and ſlander of her honeſt life to be the cauſ
                     •
                   thereof. But diſſembling his griefe he preſently departed to his owne houſe, and ſending for thoſe two Gentlemen which had made the complaint vnto him of his ſiſter and Andrugio, taking them into his chamber, as if he had in ſecrete to impart vnto them, he ſtabbed them both, to the end they ſhould not in like ſort, as they had to him acquaint others with the ſlander of his ſiſter and Andrugio.
               
               Taking order for Madam Meliſsina her buriall according to her eſtate, he kept his chamber long time, and would not be ſeene or ſpoken to of any body whatſoeuer: in the midſt of theſe ſorrowes, he often thought of Andrugio, who lay in moſt pitifull miſerie, almoſt ſtarued for want of foode by his owne command: which when hee conſidered, dreading the puniſhment of God for his light beleefe, and maſſacring thoſe he had ſlaine, beſides his ſiſters death, more neere vnto him then all the reſt, he commaunded Andrugio to be diſpoſſeſt from all the ſubſtance he had, and to bee clothed in ſuch baſe apparell as he found him in, beeing priſoner in the Turkes Gallies, and ſent him into freeſland to a friend of his, a Nobleman, whome in his letters he earneſtly deſired to inflict ſome grieuous torment vppon Andrugio.
               
               This Noble man not knowing any cauſe, but at Ieronymie his requeſt, kept him as a drudge in his kitchin to doo his ſlauerie, and for all kind of cariage for the prouiſion of his houſe, he made him to drawe home like a horſe vppon fleids, ſhooing him of purpoſe in wooden ſhooes with long calkes of yron, for ſlyding on the yſe: in this miſerie liued

                  Andrugio the tearme of two yeares, with greate penurie ſtill accuſing Fortune, that would not as wel commaund his life to be taken from him, and ſo end his calamities, as to aggrauate his paines, dayly to inflict new puniſhmentes on him, too much for a man to indure, and enough for a beaſt. Traueiling thus with his 
                     •
                  leids from place to place, there chaunced a countrie man of his, a traueiler, wanting in the towne where Andrugio was a common 
                     •
                  leid which caried paſſengers, he requeſted Andrugio (whom hee vnderderſtood dwelled within a mile or two where his buſineſſe lay) that he might paſſe with him. Andrugio vnderſtanſtanding by his ſpeech, that he either was of Saxonie, or neere there bordering, tooke him in, and curteouſly entertained him: and paſſing on their iourney, enquired from whence he was, who anſwered he was of Saxonie. This word began to renue a liuely collour in the face of miſerable Andrugio, who thought now to heare the certaine newes how all things did ſtand, of the health of his father the duke: wherefore he began as a ſtraunger that did know little, to enquire of the gouernment of the country, which the ſtranger curteouſly tolde him, adding withall the death of the Duke, with their ſorrowe for the loſſe of ſo noble a Prince. Theſe wordes cauſed Andrugio to ſhead teares moſt piteouſly, which was noted of his paſſenger, which demaunded the cauſe of his ſuddaine heauines. Andrugio excuſing the matter, ſaid that he could not chooſe but lament their loſſe, who ſhoulde want ſo good a Iuſticer as hee reported that Duke to be: demaunded further, if hee left no children behind him to ſucceede him, and how the countrie was gouerned? My friend (quoth the Saxon) but that griefe will not permit me to diſcourſ it, I could tel thee as lamētable a hiſtorie as euer thy eares haue heard, but anſwering thy demandes, I beſeech thee of friendſhip to pardon mee the reſt. Trueth is (my friend) our Duke hauing one ſonne of wit pregnan
                     •
                  , in learning forward, and of perſonage for his time peereleſſe: This yoong prince in wofull time we may

all ſay that liue in this grieued countrie of Saxonie, deſirous to learne knowledge, craued licence to ſtudy at the Vniuerſitie of Siena whether he had leaue to goe, accompanied with diuers yoong Nobles of our country, and Gentlemen of great name, who moſt vntimely loſt their liues, as they traueiled thorow Germany, and he only left aliue, & yet in great danger: but recouering his health he departed to Siena, and from thence no man knoweth whether, nor none can tell whether he liue or no, yet hath there bene great inquirie made for him in many countries. His Dukedome in his abſence is gouerned by ſixe lordes of the countrie in very good order: vnto whome not long ſince, there came a braue Gallant from the Vniuerſitie of Siena to enquire of the good health of our Dukes ſonne, named Andrugio, for that as the report ſhoweth, they were bedfellowes and ſworne friendes in Siena. But when he found not my Lord Andrugio, and was truely aduertiſed that they had not ſeene him ſince his being at Siena, with great griefe he lamented his abſence, and vowed neuer to leaue trauell vntill hee found him, or had ſome certaine newes of him: ſo leauing his name, which (as I can remember) was Galaſtio, ſonne vnto the Duke of millaine, hee departed to the great ſorrow of our Nobles, who perſwaded him earneſtly to leaue the hazard of ſo bad a match.
               
                  Andrugio who had with no litle grief harkened to this, could not forbeare the ſhedding of teares moſt aboundantlie, which the traueiler pitied to ſe, leaſt doubting that which afterwards happened.
               
                  Andrugio with much a doo drieng vp the conduites of his weeping eies, vnto the talke of the traueiler thus anſwered.
               Then good my friend (quoth hee) if your dwelling bee within the Dukedome of Saxonie, as you make report, tell me I beſeech you how you came by the knowledge of this that you haue made relation, & I wil requite you if I may.
               Yea, quoth the traueiler, I was borne in 
                     •
                  he Dukedome

and from my childbyrth brought vp ye citie where the Duke kept his court. What I ſay is full well knowen vnto mee, My father a Gentleman of his Graces retinue while he liuen, whome I haue daily ſeene with teares to bewaile the death of this good Duke, and with no litle ſorrow, lament his ſonnes abſence. Tell me then friend, how if it ſhoulde be thy chance to meet the dukes ſonne, what fauour wouldſt thou doe him: if his want were great, couldſt thou anie way relieue him, or in what ſorce wouldeſt thou deale with hym. Sir (quoth hee) if my hope were ſuche to finde him, I were the happieſt creature of my whole progenie, and ſo ſhoulde repute my ſelfe, and great fauour ſhould I gaine in my country if I might but bring certain newes of his life or death, to whome I would willingly as my dutie and leache Lord, impart what I haue or can by my acquaintance, marchantes of our owne countrie take vp to relieue him, whome I truſt, needeth not my helpe, if he liue.
               The dukes ſonne may thinke himſelfe bound to you quoth Andrugio, if he did but know your loue to him, and if he be a gentleman, he cannot but requite it. That Andrugio, by talke had knowledge of the man, yet not reſolued, whether to make himſelfe knowne vnto his countriman, to heare the ſorrowe of the Lordes for his abſence, and what griefe his whole countrey indured for him: beſides his double ſorrowe for the deceaſe of his noble father ſtudying this what to doe, hee refolued that it was the pleaſure of God, ſo formnately to giue him knowledge of the ſtate of his countrie, and therefore not againſt the pleaſure of God to refuſe ſo good opportunitie, leaſt he that ſendeth all happineſſe diſpleaſed at his follies, ſhoulde augment his puniſhmentes. wherefore reſolued (he ſaith) Lorenzo (for ſo was he called) ſince I ſee the loue thou bareſt the duke in his life, as thy report, to his houre after deathe, ſheweth, I were vngratefull, if I ſhoulde not requite thee with ſome friendſhip. Therefore my good Lorenzo, know that thou

art the man yt ſhalt glad the heartes of them thou ſayſt doo mourne, by bringing them certaine tidinges of Lord Andrugio their yoong Prince, whome I can aſſure thee, liueth but in great pouertie, farre vn
                     ••
                  tting his eſtate. wherfore if thou canſt procure to furniſhe him with prouiſion of apparell and money for his charges, I can and will bring thee to his preſence, let me know therefore thy minde for our iournie beginneth to ſhorten, and I muſt leaue thee. Lorenzo hearing the name of him whome he had thought neuer to haue ſeene more, began to note the man more and more, but ſo much was he altered in countenance, with the ſunne, and weather beating at ſea, that he coulde not knowe him, wherefore Lorenzo beſought him of that zeale that Chriſtians owe one to another, not to hide himſelfe anie longer, if he were the man as he did ſuppoſe he was, to let him knowe it, that he might doe him that dutie as to hys dread Lord, or if not himſelf, not to depart vntil he brought him vnto Lord Andrugio his preſence, that if his pouertie be ſuch as you report, Lorēzo may relieue it, and ſhew the zeale, he oweth vnto the noble Andrugio.
               
               
                  Andrugio, being aſſured by this of Lorenzo his zeale could forbeare no longer, but with teares running lyke ſtreams, wringing Lorenzo by ye hand, ſayd, Lorenzo, my olde acquainted friend and companion Lorenzo, how may my heart reioyce to heare thy loue to him whom thou neuer hadſt no cauſe to thinke on? but ſince I knewe it by proof, and ſee what dutie thou didſt owe the duke deceaſed, albeit I may be aſhamed to manifeſt that I cannot conceale from thee. Know this Lorenzo, I a

                   that Andrugio, Sonne and Heire to the noble Duke of Saxonie, who by the crueltie of fortune haue neuer liued ſince my going to Siena but in great miſerie, and neuer was it my chance in my trauels, which hath not bene ſmall, to mee
                     •
                  e with anie of my acquaintance. But ſeeing God hath cauſed thee to be the firſt, and only man: let me know Lorenzo, thy counſell what is beſt to be done, thou ſeeſt the life I

lead is ſlauiſhe and moſte odious, ſuche as my heart hardly broketh, yet can I not eſchew it in any ſort. If I ſhould fue, he, to whome I am thus inthralled, would purſue me: if I refuſe this wherein I haue ſome libertie, then might it be worſe for me, nor how to diſcharge my ſelfe from it, I cannot deuiſe: if I acquaint him with my eſtate, then may
                     •
                   be, that he will inflict ſome great ſommes of monie on me, for my ranſome, ſo that I am now in ſuch an agon

                   I know not what ſhal become of me. Deſirous I am to ſee my natiue countrie and friendes, and to comfort theſe my louing ſubiectes, which ſorrow for my abſence: if thou lend ayde to my deſire, let me knowe therefore thy aduiſe Lorenzo, and aſſure thee, that the good thou affoordeſt me in this extremetie, ſhalbe repayd thee with many thankes.
               
                  Lorenzo ſhed teares aboundant, to heare his tale, yet was his heart ſurpriſed ſo with ioy, that hee coulde not ſpeake, but paſſing it ouer as he might, kneeling on hys knees, humbly kiſſed his hand, giuing God thankes, for bleſſing him with ſo good fortune, as to be the firſt that ſhould bring the tidinges of comfort to his countrie, proteſting withal, his purſe, yea life & all, was at his commandement: & my good Lord, (quoth he) touching your departure, if you will be ruled by my aduiſe, we will return to the place from whence we came, where I haue ſome friends & acquaintance of our countrie, with whome I will deale, for monie and neceſſaries, befitting your Lordſhip, your ſelfe ſhall reſt as ſecret as you may, vntill the ſpring our ſhips may be free, when with the firſt we will depart. This counſell liked Andrugio well, and without deniall returned to the place from whence they came, which ere they might recouer, was late in the night. Lorenzo being well acquainted in his lodging, called them vp with diuers of his countrimen, to whome he declared what had happened, who were as ioyfull of this good newes as Lorenzo.
               
               Thus remained Prince Andrugio, amongeſt hys friendly countriemen, honoured with all titles of maieſtie

beſeeming his eſtate, but verie ſecret, nor neuer diſcloſed, what hee was but amongeſt themſelues, for whome Lorenzo was not a little careful to prouide all thinges for his honor, that he might with maieſtie, beſeeming a prince returne to his countrie.
               All thinges prouided for this his happie iournie, the ſpring nowe appearing, where the froſen alpes began to diſcloſe, and the ſplendant beames of the ſunne ſhewed in moſte glorie, Their prouiſion beeing all readie to clappe a boord, they attend but his pleaſure that hathe wrought all thinges elſe for their content, to ſend them a happie gale: whiche luckely comming as they expected, they were with the firſt readie to ſet ſaile, bidding Freeſland farewel, their gallant Barke fleeſed the waues, with a proſperous and happie gale, to the ending of euerie one of their wiſhes, and accompliſhing Andrugio his deſire. Time, and ſhort time, hath brought them to the port of their deſire, when they had no ſooner anchored, but Lorenzo ſent by Andrugio, haſtined to ſee his aged father, and withall to will him in all haſte to repayre vnto him, to participate in counſell, what he were beſt to doe, either ſodenly to make his arriuall knowne, or to conceale it for a time, but ſcarſly had Lorenzo his father bleſſed him, & giuen his welcome, when blab-like he reuealed vnto his father Andrugio his comming, who as ioyfull to heare it, as the other was in recounting it, preſently ſpred it throughout the citie, and to the gouernours of the ſtate, who preſently vpon the report, addreſſed themſelues withall the honour they could to receaue him, commanding the belles to be roong, and ſollome prayſes with reioyſing fires, throughout the Citie in ſigne of ioy.
               
                  Andrugio expecting long the returne of Lorenzo, looking earneſtly for him, on the ſodaine heard all the belles to ring, which made him admire woonderfully: in the end hee might beholde the ſhoare filled with multitudes of people, and the numbers to increaſe, by which he imagined, there

was ſome thing in hand. Thus ſtanding in dumpes, there came from the ſhore all the Nobles of his countrie to giue him welcome and to bring him to land, wher with great ioy of his ſubiects he was intertained in ſuch ſort, as might haue cauſed the mightieſt Emperour to haue thought well of his people, and to giue them thankes. In great pompe rides Andrugio to his pallace with ioifull hearts receiued of his ſubiectes, who to ſhew their loues, with triumphes, maſking, and other paſtimes, during one whole we
                     •
                  k ſpent their times.
               The ſolemne welcome was not finiſhed, when the lords and ſtates of the countrie that had the gouernment, in open aſſembly deliuered their authoritie in moſt reuerent and dutiful maner, acknowledging him to be the right and lawful heir of their deceiſed duke, deſiring him yt guideth the harts of all princes, to make him as fortunate in his actions as his father.
               
                  Andrugio ſetled thus in his Dukedome, gouerned with great wiſedom, vſing iuſtice to all, with his nobles familiar, and to his commons curteous, wronging no man, but releeuing all that were comfortles, to the priſoners and men in bondage, he had a ſpeciall regard, meaſuring their miſeries by his owne calamities, hauing ben as they are. To recount all his honors, would fil large volumes, and grow tedious to the hearer onlie let this ſuffice, he liued the tearmes of two yeares and more vnmaried, beloued of all within his dukedome ſo generally, that they delighted in nothing ſo much, as in lauding & extolling his honorable actions in ſuch wiſe that other countries gaue him the like honor as his owne people: paſſing the flouring prime of his youth, the Nobles of his country hauing care of the ſtate, offered many greate mariages, but al to no purpoſe: with thankes he returned all their friendſhip, accepting none. The old ſinders of affections which lay raked vp in his heart, began now againe to burne, ſo that day nor night was ſpent without great care taking how he might accompliſh his deſire, & inioy Suſania
                  
to his wife, yet for that ſhe was ſo baſe, and fearing his n

                  bles would be offended, to know her calling, & refuſing their offers, was in great perplexitie, not dating to diſcloſe it to his deareſt friend and moſt familiar. But Cupid geuing ſpur to his deſires, could not let him reſt vntill hee ſought ſome meane for his quiet. Caſting many waies in his perplexed mind, how to giue his heart eaſe, and his deſire end, determineth to prooue the faithfulneſſe of Lorenzo, whom he had aduanced to honor, for this fauour ſhowed: wherfore finding opportunitie, he brake with him after this manner.
               
                  Lorenzo, how much I doo reckon my ſelfe beholding vnto thee I will not ſay, by whoſe means and good fortune in meeting thee I am the ſooner ſetled in my Dukedome, a friendſhip which ſhall neuer be forgotten ſo long as Andrugio liueth. But Lorenzo as thy faith hath bene firme vnto me, and thy readineſſe as great to doo me this good, ſo am I the bolder to make choiſe of thee aboue al I know to impart a matter of more waight, and toucheth me nerer then the loſſe of my Dukedom, in which if I find thy readineſſe and ſecrecie according to my wiſh, thou bindeſt Andrugio by an euerlaſting band of inuiolable friendſhip to reſt thine. Speake therefore Lorenzo, if I ſhall repoſe this truſt and confidence in thee according as I doo deſire, then ſolemnely ſweare the concealing of the ſame, and thy ſpeedy furtherance.
               
                  Lorenzo as one deſiring nothing more then the princes fauour and to augment his good opinion of him rather thē to decraſe it any way, proteſted vnto hun by the faith of a loyall ſubiect, that rather would he iudure all the torments that might be deuiſed, then diſcloſe any thing he was charged to conceale, to any one, but ſuch as he was commaunded.
               
                  Andrugio ſeeing by his earneſt lookes, that he meante faith, interrupted his ſpeech: ſaying, enough Lorenzo, I accept thy word, therefore hearken to what I haue to ſay vnto thee.
               
                  
Thou haſt heard me already recount the hard beginning of my vnfortunate iourny to Siena, with loſſe of my friēdly companions, what time my ſelfe hardly eſcaped with life: wounded thus I was cured by the handes of a ſimple countrie woman, who entartained me well, of whom I wanted nothing neceſſarie for my releefe. During this my time of ſicknes, I was attended on by my friendly Oſ
                     •
                  es daughter, a maiden with all perfections of a woman ſo indowed, that it is hard to finde her equall. This maiden for her womaniſh behauiour, her wiſdome and good conditions, beſides her beautie which exceeded, ſo pleaſed my minde, that ſhe wonne my affections to be hers: yea ſo did I in hearte craue her for my wife, before all that euer I ſawe, that I took no pleaſure but in her companie, to parlie with her, and to heare the ſweete ſoule recount ſuch olde tales as ſhee had learned of her ancient father and mother. To this mayden (Lorenzo) I plighted my faith to liue with her as my wife, and ſhe the like to me, as to her huſband, the which vow, I neither can nor may forget. Wherefore (Lorenzo) being now oppreſt with the remembrance of the ſame, I cannot be quiet day nor night vntil I enioy her preſence, and be linked in mariage to her whom I eſteeme deerer then my life. Now Lorenzo my wil is, that in the ſecreteſt maner thou maiſt, thou prouide thy ſelfe with ſuch ſommes of money neceſſarie for this iourney, and accompanied with thy truſtieſt ſeruants, ſpeede thee vnto my beloued, and in my name greete her from me, and deliuer this peece of ring for a token which ſhe gaue me at our departure: by vertue of which commaund her to come to me with all ſpeede, A ſigne to giue true teſtimonie from whome thou comeſt, and intreat her Lorenzo as the wife of thy Lord. See thou apparell her as beſeemeth my wife, before ſhe approch the confines of our Dukedome. This buſineſſe committed vnto thee, perfourme as faithfully as my hope is in thee, and bind Andrugio for euer to be Lorenzos. Thou knoweſt my mind, my Treaſurer ſhall furniſh thy iourney with

treaſure, to whom thou ſhalt haue my warrant, make ſpeed therefore as thou tendereſt his life that holdeth thee deere.
               
                  Lorenzo hauing heard his long diſcourſe, humbly thanked his Grace for the good opinion he had conceiued of him proteſting that his loyaltie and dutie ſhould in ſuch ſort bee employed, as he might iuſtly ſay at his returne, Lorenzo is faithfull, honeſt, and firm, whereof my gratious Lord (quoth he) haue no farther care, but according to your truſt, all ſhall be perfourmed, as your heart ſhall wiſh or deſire.
               
                  Lorenzo ſleeped litle time, but hauing made his prouiſion, departed the citie and iornied day and night, vntill hee came to the deſerts of Guſqueno, where the beloued of his Lord made her abode: to whome Andrugio his meſſenger came not before he was looked for, nor ſo ſoone by many yeares, for that ſhe neuer heard of him ſince his going firſt to Siena, by reaſon of his troubles. Lorenzo hauing recouered ye Millers houſe, enquired after the maiden, to whoſe preſence being come, in reuerēt maner (more then ſhe would or wiſhed) doing his duetie, he recounteth vnto her Andrugio his meſſage, declaring that it was his pleaſure that preſently ſhe come vnto him, for that the time was nowe come that all thinges to her content and his deſire ſhould be perfourmed.
               
                  Suſania when her hope was all paſt, euer to ſee or heare of him againe, hauing bene abſent ſo long, and neuer coulde heare any tydings of him, neither in his owne countrie, nor at Siena, whether he iornied from her fathers houſe, thought verily he had bene dead, wherefore on the ſuddaine could not tell what to ſay yet viewing the peece of ring, which ſhe did well know, ſhe imagined that he was liuing, wherfore after diuers queſtions, demanded of Andrugio his ſucceſſe in his abſence both abroad and at home, anſwered, what you are I know not, wherefore I beſeech you of pardon, if vnreuerently I vſe you, or not as beſeemeth your calling, my bringing vp is ruſtick as you ſee in this poore cottage, and your ſelf a meere ſtranger vnto me. Touching my Lords demand

I know not what to ſay, being not at myne owne diſpoſing, but to be gouerned by them of whom I receiued my being: as I haue euer by them bene ruled, ſo wil I of them be aduiſed, yet my Lords loue is deere vnto me, yea dearer then mine owne ſoule. Reſt you I beſeeche you ſir this night with ſuch homely viandes as this wilderneſſe affoordeth, welcome I aſſure you ſhall be your beſt cheare, and at my Fathers home-comming you ſhall know more.
               
                  Lorenzo wearied with trauaile, accepteth her offer, yeelding thanks for that fauour.
               
                  Suſania deſcanning on Lorenzo his meſſage, imagineth whether her heart was ioyful or no, hauing ſo good a cauſe, and her hope ſo great to come from a Millers cottage to a princes, & liue in court honoured of Nobles. This happy tydings could Suſania with much paine indure to conceale any time, wherefore ſhee diſpatcheth a meſſenger in all haſt to ſeek her father and mother, vnto whom being come, ſhee recounteth at large Andrugio his meſſage deliuered by Lorenzo, with his happie ſucceſſe, and attayning vnto hys dukedome, with all beſeeching her father and mother, as they loued and tendered the preferment of their childe, not to gainſay the will of the noble Andrugio, for that their loues had bene equall, & fortune had done them both wrong to ſeparat them ſo long, ſeeing it ſtood with the pleaſure of God, after many daies of trouble to her louing Lord, and no little ſorrow to her ſelfe, that they might inioy ech other, his francke conſent, with her mothers, might be granted.
               Thus with ioy, the toonge faltering in hir mouth, ſhee could not vtter a word more, which the father perceiuing, beganne to cenſure the cauſe, proceeded of great ioye and entering into iudgement of all cauſes, which might be preiudiciall to his childe, as alſo the deſire he had to ſee her well beſtowed, the old beldam his wife caſting their heads togither, in priuie counſell, betwixt them it was agreed that ſhe ſhould goe, although nature would hardly brooke to forgoe her, eſpecially ſo farre, that all thinges conſidered, and

that their faith was plighted one to another, they woulde not be denied, wherefore at ſupper Lorenzo being placed at ſuch homely viandes, as could be ſodainly prepared, the aged father ſaid, Gentleman of Saxonie, if my Andrugio, your Duke were preſent, he could be but welcome, and ſo he hath bene to this ſimple cottage, ſo aſſure your ſelfe you be, and thankes I yeeld you with my heart for this paynes taken for the benefite of my poore childe, for whome without b
                     •
                  aſt I may with teares report, I haue and euer had a fathers care. Many a good yeomanly ſonne, yea, and ſonnes of gentle race, hath ſhee forſaken, proffering their loue with large dowries vnto her. But ſince the time of your Dukes lodging in my houſe, ſhe neuer had anie minde of mariage, taking leſſe pleaſure in hearing of any ſuch offer then in ought elſe might be ſpoken: my ſelfe coulde neuer tell the cauſe, but that my wife her mother did partly vnderſtand ſomewhat of her mind, being heauy, ſad, & diuers times ſickely. when other youth ſpent their times in pleaſure and ſporting, to recreate themſelues, ſhe would wayle and lament in ſuch ſorte, as it hath not a little greeued me to behold. But (my Lord) what was concealed then, I partly geſſe at now, it was loue I ſee, the loue of my Lord Andrugio, who by what meanes I know not hath obtayned her heart and faithfull liking, and ſince I heare by the report of my daughter, howe conſtant hee remaineth in hys choyſe, not reſpecting her baſe birth, and that I holde it the wil of God, after manie perils, they ſhould inioy ech others companie, I am content ſhe ſhalbe at his graces obedience and my ſelfe with what I haue at his commaundement, praying God to make them in loue ſo happie, as the fortunateſt that euer liued. And this by the way my good Lord, ſince it hath pleaſed him amongeſt manie others to make you the man ſhould take charge of my childe, and to bring her to his preſence, I doe herewithall beſeeche thee as thou art noble, and bound to defend virgins to the vttermoſt of thy power, to be ayding vnto her, not ſuffering her

to be iniuried in what thou mayeſt remedie, I knowe her aduancement ſhall haue manie enemies, who ſpiting that ſhe from ſo baſe birth ſhuld be ſo exalted, wil enuy her happineſſe, and be a meane to ſet diſcord betwixt the duke and her, by which meanes ſhe may be ſcorned, & caſt from hys preſence, and ſo conſtrained to ſeeke her fortune in miſerie. wherefore to preuent inſuing euils, as thou tendereſt the loue of thy princely Lord, that ſent thee, ſweare vnto me, by that order of nobilitie, which thou profeſſeſt in all extremeties to be ayding vnto her, and in Gods name at your pleaſure, ſhe ſhall accompanie you.
               
                  Lorenzo liſtening to the large diſcourſe of this kinde father, noting the care he had for his childe, whome he t
                     •
                  nderly loued, preſuming on his Lordes conſtancie, vowed with ſolemne othes vnto him, that ſo long as euer it pleaſed the deuine deities, to preſerue him with life, hee would ſtand and abide a father, and firme friend vnto her, and in al honeſt cauſes maintaine her iuſt quarrell againſt all men, yea if it were againſt the duke himſelfe.
               Time now is come when they muſt depart: wherefore theſe aged parentes might not forbeare the ſhedding of teares in moſte aboundant wiſe, the ſight whereof moued Lorenzo to great pitie, yet paſſing ouer the extremitie thereof, with a heauie heart, and countenance wanne for her departure, he ſaith, my louing daughter, how I haue nouriſhed thee euer from thy birth, thou canſt partly conceaue by my fauours ſhewed, ſince thou hadſt reaſon to knowe good from euill, in hope to finde thee a comfort to thy mother and me, nowe in the enclining of our dayes in the earth, which how neere they drawe, he that gaue vs breath beſt knoweth. But contrarie to my expectation, thou art now parting from vs, into a better place, where thou haſt few friendes, and leſſe acquaintance: wherefore it behoueth thee to haue the more regard to thy behauiour: for I tell thee my Suſania, promotions haue manie enemies & fewe friendes the mightieſt are hated when the poore liue ſecurely, wherefore as it is the pleaſure of the higheſt, to make

thee the beſt of thy kinne, haue theſe preceptes in minde, and doubtleſſe thou ſhalt inioy thy eſtate in the leſſe perill: Let not thy calling make thee proud nor diſdainfull, but remember alwaies from whence thou cameſt: if thou be humble, thy nobles in better ſort will loue thee, but being ambitious, wil diſdaine thee, & ſeeke thy deſtruction, Emperours and mightie potentates, thorowe ambition haue bene foyled, and thruſt from their 
                     •
                  eates of dignitie. Then let not this eſtate make thee proud, leaſt it fare worſe with thee. Be duetifull to thy Lord and huſband: if hee loue thee, be thou kind to him: if he be froward, do not with croſſe ſpeeches moue him, for odious ſpeeches will make thy honeſt behauiour lothſome vnto him: if he be impatient with anie, let thy induſtrie be to pacifie him, and for thine owne part, let not his ſpeeches, ſpoken neuer ſo greatly in thy diſgrace moue thee to choller, ſo ſhalt thou ſhew thy ſelfe wiſe. If he haue any imperfection, do not as common goſſips do vpon their quaffing reueale it, for that is a moſte odious fault, and it ſhal make thee a laughing ſtocke to others, and cauſe thy honeſtie to be attempted by ruffians, and ſuch as would gladly ſee thy diſhonour, for all honeſt women will feare that, which is commōly ſpoken of diſhoneſt women. Briefly pleaſe thy Lord and huſband in all thinges, but eſpecially in ſuch as draw neereſt his inclination, loue him intirely aboue all others, be patient and learne to winke at manie thinges he doth the prudent in thy houſhold affaires, careful to bring vp thy children, fayre ſpoken, kinde and courteous to his nobles, and all others, plentiful in honourable works, a friend to the honeſt, and a verie enemie to light youthes, as thy leyſure from thy Lord ſhall permit: ſpend thy tyme in reading learned ſayinges of the wiſe, for by ſuche honeſt occupations women are withdrawn from other vnworthy exerciſes. Thus as a father haue I in my blunt maner, preſcribed thee to gaine the loue of all men, and continue the good opinion of thy Lord. Time draweth on, and thy protectour Lord Lorenzo attendeth thee, wherefore I will

detaine thee no longer, but with my bleſſing commend you to the protection of him that beſt knoweth how to preſerue thee, and ſo ſweet daughter farewell.
               Thus after kind teares ſpen
                     •
                   on either ſide for their departure, Lorenzo contenting bountifullie his hoſt for his entertainment, they betake thēſelues to their deſired iorney. Duke Andrugio which had long expected to heare of his beſt beloued, is now certified by a meſſenger, that ſhe with Lorenzo are within two daies iourny of the court: vppon which newes, he ſommoneth his nobles and eſtates, commanding them to be ready to accompanie him the next day, in the moſt ſumtuous ſort they migh, to giue entertainment vnto a ſtranger, comming from far to ſee him, yt which was accordingly performed in ſuch wiſe, as Andrugio by their diligence in fulfilling ſo ſodainly his deſire, thought himſelf moſt highly honoured by them. Thus all thinges perfourmed as his heart could wiſh, the next morning Andrugio with his train ſet forward to meete Suſania at the houſe of Signior Anthony a knight of his court, where hee had appointed to meete her: vpon which iourney, as hee traueyled, hee acquainted diuers of his chiefeſt Lordes with the pretence of his comming from the Court, & with what zeale he had honoured and loued that mayden, which they went to meete: beſeeching them of that loue they did beare vnto him and his deceaſed father
                     •
                  , to make account of his loue, and to do her that reuerence which belonged vnto the Lady and wife of their Duke, for that ſhe was the obiect of his heart, and the onely one that ſhould participate with him in loue.
               The Nobles which harkened to his proteſtation ſo vnſuſpected, began diuers waies to coniecture of the ſame, his friendes and truſtie followers conceiuing the beſt: others whoſe loue was not ſo firme, as it pleaſed them: yet all alike to content him, gaue their willing conſentes, that if hee had planted his liking, it were againſt reaſon & their othes of dutie and obedience, to gainſay what liked him. Therfore

wiſhing vnto him much ioy of what his heart deſired, they bad God proſper them both to their owne content.
               Paſſing the way in parlie, they arriue at the houſe of Signiour Anthony, who glad to ſee his Lord and maiſter within his manſion, had prouided the cheare hee could come by, bidding him and his traine moſt friendly welcome. To tell you the exceeding ioy of thoſe two Louers at their meeting were needleſſe, but ſuppoſe how welcome the ſight of any long deſired thing is vnto you, ſo ſhall you eaſily geſſe in what happie eſtate thoſe louers thought themſelues.
               After ſome conference had betwixt the Duke and his beloued, with the conſent of their nobles, their mariage was determined, and preſentlie in the houſe of Anthony was it conſtituted to both their contentes, and the liking of all ſuch as loued him, who with a generall conſent made outward apparance of their good conſents.
               This mariage performed, and ſome time ſpent in pleaſure, as tilting, maſking, and other paſtimes in honor of the wedding, the Duke with his new adopted Princeſſe thanking their friendly Hoſt for their entertainment, bad him farewell, departing towards their owne pallace, wher they were of the citizens (wher he kept his court) moſt royallye receiued, each one crieng with a generall voice, God ſaue their Duke and Ducheſſe.
               The tearme of two yeares and ſometime more was paſſed in exceeding ioyes betwene thoſe kind Louers, in which time God ſent thē two ſaire & goodly children, to wit, one ſome and one daughter to their great ioy, and reioycing of all the commons. But as the vertuous bee alwaies moſt ſubiect to the enuie of the worlde, ſo in time the fire of hatred which had bene long ſmochering in the boſomes of Gonſalo and Flodericus, two Nobles of Saxony began to breake foorth into hot burning flames, in ſuch ſort that rayſing their tenants, kin, and followers, perſwading them their intents were honorable, and for the benefite of their common wealth. Thus they aſſembled a great armie and

encamped themſelues within two ſmall miles of the court, ſeeking by al the meanes they could to draw vnto them ſuch as fauoured the Duke and his.
               The newes of this rebellion brought vnto Court, the Duke marueiling much what ſhould be the cauſe: preſently to preuent inſuing miſchiefes, as well as for his own preſeruation, diſpatcheth with all ſpeed poſtes for all his Nobles, commanding them with al the power they could make to repaire to ye court. In ye mean time himſelf prouideth (as he beſt could) for the ſafety of the city. Whē he had takē this courſe, being thereunto aduiſed by his friendes, hee diſpatcheth his chiefe Her aught at armes vnto thoſe two rebellious Nobles, commanding them to diſlodge their armie, and to yeeld themſelues to his mercie. But they whoſe ſtomackes were ſharply bent to ſee his confuſion, with ſtout tearins refuſe his honorable meſſage, and by his Her aught deſ
                     •
                  ed him: commanding moſt arrogantly the Herhaught to tell the Duke, that their pretence was to ſubuert the dukedome and to driue with ſhame both the Duke and his beggerlike Compere from ſo honorable a place as the Dukedome of Saxonie: adding further, that in the life time of his father their late Soueraigne, they were ſworne to maintaine the eſtate and honorable reputation of the Dukes houſe, which he his ſonne did not regard, but had by ioyning in mariage with a baſe Minion, ruinated his poſteritie, and made their bloods innoble, refuſing for her many of honour and great reputation which were offered him. Wherefore Her aught (quoth Flodericus) ſay thus vnto the Duke, that if he wil condeſcend vnto ſuch demandes of our, as wee ſhall ſet downe, we ſhall accordingly ſubmit our ſelues vnto him and acknowledge our duties: otherwiſe we are reſolued to die in that cauſe which we haue taken vpon vs to maintain.
               The Her aught hauing heard their anſweres, certified the Duke of their intentes, wherewith hee was not a litle grieued: yet as one tendering carefully his Ladies loue and welfare, he ſtill concealed the ſame from her, determining

rather to end his life, then part with his heartes deſice: in ſuch account held he the loue of his Lady, whoſe curteous behauiour was ſuch, as gained the good liking of all his ſubiectes, from the beſt to the meaneſt, onely thoſe two Nobles, of enuie that the Duke refuſed the daughter and heire of Gonſalo, ſought his deſtruction.
               To be briefe, ſo ſtrong were thoſe two Rebels, that they beſieged the citie round about in ſuch wiſe, yt in ſhort a time their victuals began to wax ſcarſe, and no remedie, but either they muſt all ſtarue, or trie their fortunes by the ſword. The Duke thus reſolued with his company, aſtying on him that in many miſeries had bene his protector, yſſued out on vnawares vpon his enemies and fought with them a ſharpe and grieuous battell, in which many of his companie miſcaried, and hee compelled to flie, loſing the field: at which time his enemies taking their aduantage, purſuing them that ſled towards the citie, entered pell mell committing great ſlaughters of his people, in the end being quietly poſſeſſed of the ſame, they ſought for the Duke, who was not to be found. Wherefore to be reuenged on the Duches, they determined to put her to the ſword, for whoſe life the common people with one generall voice made earneſt interceſſion, at whoſe requeſt ſhe was preſerued, but baniſhed with her two Infants, commanded vpon paine of her life neuer to returne againe, within any part of the regiment of the Dukedome of Saxonie.
               
               This cruell ſentence pronounced againſt the Ducheſſe, cauſed a number, which dutifully honoured the Lady for her curteous conditions, to ſhed teares, & to be earneſt Suters for her, but in vaine, for ſhe muſt needs depart to ſeeke her fortune, where it beſt pleaſed the giuer of al good to guide her.
               This wofull Lady baniſhed in ſuch wiſe as you heare, her onely companions were two wayting women, which for her loue exiled themſelues, departed the Citie, ſo ouercharged

with ſorrow, as might haue moued a heart harder then adamant, to haue pitted her: yet for her owne part content to beare this yoke with patience, ſo that ſhee might be certified of her Lord the Duke, who hiding himſelfe in the deſartes, durſt not be knowne or ſeene of anie one, but as fortune had parted them in extremitie, ſo God gaue them leaue to meete in their ſorrowes, to comfort one the other. For loe, as he by chance was ſtragling, to gather roots and hearbes to relieue his hungrie ſtomacke, hauing no other ſuſtenance, hee heard the pitifull lamentation of a woman, complayning her hard fortune, and bitterly weeping ouer her tender babes, beſeeching God to ſhew that mercie vnto a diſtreſſed wretche, in her aduerſitie, to grant the duke to meete them.
               
                  Andrugio which with a woefull heart had liſtened to this ſorrowfull plaint, knowing well the voyce of hys deare Ladie, was ſo ouercharged with griefe, yt he could not well ſpeake: but recouering his ſences, he cryeth out on fortune which wrought his miſeries, but more exclaymed againſt the fates and deſtinies, that had ſuffered him to eſcape with life, to ſee his Ladie and ſweete babes to indure ſuch extremitie. After he had long debated with himſelfe, what was beſt to be done in ſuch an exigent, he entered ye place where his Ladie ſate, rocking on her knee the ſweete babe, which was a daughter: whoſe face, when the good Ladie beheld howe ioyfull ſhee was I neede not relate, onely this let me tell you, his preſence exiled from her heart the greateſt griefe. After this ioyfull meeting, and that they had recompted one to the other, their miſhaps, Andrugio as one carefull for his Ladie and infantes, more then for himſelfe, bethought manie waies of one eſpeciall, by which they might haue comfort: calling to minde his friend and companion, Galaſtino now duke of Millaine, he determineth not to reſt in anie place vntill he could recouer his countrie. And thus ſetting his mind throughlie ſo to doe, he with his Lady and two children, with the two waiting Gentlewomen,

with all ſpeede they might, repaired to the next port towne, which was within three or foure leaguts of them, where they embarqued themſelues, for Millaine, ſelling ſuch iewels as they had to pay their paſſage.
               The winde ſeruing fitly for their purpoſe, within ſhort time, they diſcouer the high landes of the countrie, & within ſmall time after, the citie of Millaine, whether by the grace and helpe of Godthey came ſafely, and being in an euening lated, tooke their lodging in an o

               When Andrugio had repoſed himſelfe and that his heart was a little ſetled to quiet, beeing out of the danger of his owne countrey: taking fit opportunitie, when the Duke of Millaine with his nobles were pleaſantly paſſing the time, in beholding the

               When Andrugio came before the duke, and that by the noblemen hee was aduertiſed yt the ſtranger was of Saxonie, the duke viewing well this face, knewe him to be the duke of Saxonie, and lighting from his horſe, imbraſed him moſt louingly, maruelling what had happened, that thus one beſeeming the eſtate of his maieſtie, he came vnto

Thus enquiring where the duches remained, he gaue preſent charge to diuers his nobles, with his own coche to go to her lodging, & in the beſt and honourableſt maner they might, to bring her to the court. This friendſhip of the dukes ſo vnexpected of Andrugio, ſo ouerioyed his oppreſſed heart, as with the ſame hee was almoſt ouercome: whereof hee thanked God moſt highly, and next, his maieſty beſeeching God to maintaine the h

                  Andrugio ſetlcd in Millaine, where hee was welcome as to his owne home, coulde not content himſelfe in this wiſe, but grieued in minde to ſee his miſerie, more exclaymed on fortune, for this cruel part, then for all the ſorrowes he had indured: ſo carefull was he, for his ſweete children, yt he did neyther quietly poſſeſſe ſleepe, nor without trouble of minde eate his meate, wherefore entering into conſideration of his preſent ſtate, waying what he was by byrth, and what pleaſure he had poſſeſſed, well conſidering what an vnſtable goddeſſe they ſerue, which are fortunes darlinges, growing into contempt of all worldly thinges, for that hee noted their frailtie, and diligently ſearching the ioyes of heauenly motions, determineth for euer to abandon himſelfe from all humaine ſocietie, in deſpight of fortune, and the vaine intiſing baytes of the world whiche he ſeeth is tranſitorie, he ſequeſtreth himſelfe from the world, onely contenting himſelfe in contemplation. And thus hauing

thorowly reſolued what to doe, in an euening late, when all men draw homewards from their ſollace, and paſtimes abroad, to ioyes of their friends at home, Andrugio vnknown, or without acquainting anie man of his pretēce, withdrewe himſelfe into a deſart, twentie miles diſtant from Millaine, where fearing a place, which was by all likelihoodes, leaſt frequented, he labored vntill he had builded in the hollowe of a hard rocke, a proper lodge, where the remainder of his life he finiſhed contented with rootes, hearbes and ſuch prouiſion as the earth naturally yeelded: where when hee had ſpent ſome time, in continuall prayer, and heartes caſe, and ſaw the quiet content hee inioyed in that life, entering into the manifold miſeries of all Chriſtians, he exclaimeth on that fickle goddeſte fortune, in theſe bitter tearmes.
               O fortune conſtant, in thy vnconſtancie, if there be ſuch a dame as phantaſticall Poets affirme, whoſe blindneſſe cannot diſcerne the noble from the peſantes, the Lord from the ſlaue, nor the ſeruant from the mayſter: cruell art thou which takeſt thy pleaſure in ouerthrowing monarchies and exalting the baſe, onely of preſumption, to derogate to thy name, a title of Godhead. But what vaine opinions they hold, yt tearme thee a goddeſſe, are eaſily to be perceaued, if they enter into it: for what can the ſeruant doe without ſufferance of the maiſter, or what power haſt thou, but by the ſufferance of him that breaketh life into all his creatures? but fo

                  iſh be they which haue by their ſupplications to thy blinde dietie, made thee more preſumptious, where they ought to tread thy honour vnder foote: for what is fortune, but a fayned deuiſe of mans ſpirite? an imagination without trueth? vpon which (as Plutarhe ſayth) a man cannot ſettle his iudgement, nor cōprehend it, by any courſe of reaſon, ſo that by this we muſt confeſſe, that all thinges are ruled and guided by the prouidence of God, and not by blinde fortune: for when wee want the bleſſinges of God through his anger which wee cannot appeaſe, then

we accuſe our ignorance, and ingratitude towardes his mamaieſty, by the vnfortunate chance of humaine things falling through the common error of men. we attribute to fortune, As the Romans in elder tunes honored Fortune more then all the world, calling her the Nurſe, Patrone and vpholder of the citie of Rome: they builded for her, many ſumptuous Temples, wherein they honored this proude dame by many tytles.
               
                  Silla hauing obtained the Dictatorſhip, yelded himſelfe and al his actions to Fortune, ſauing that he accounted himſelfe the child of Fortune, and thereupon took vnto him the name of happie Iulius Caeſar, gaue a certaine aſſurance of the hope he had in Fortune, when entering a ſmall Frigot in ſo dangerous a ſtorme, that the Maiſter was loth to waigh his anchor: he ſaid thus vnto him be not affraide my friend, for thou carieſt Caeſar and his Fortune.
               
                  Aguſtus ſending his Nephew to the warres, wiſhed him to be as valiant as Scypio, and as fortunate as himſelf. Theſe and many other of great prowes and magnificence, forgetting the honor of the true God, attribute al to fortune, which is nothing. Ah deceitfull Fortune, thou art eaſilye found, but hardly auoided. They that haue moſt laboured to paint out this fained Goddes ſay, that ſhe hath a ſwift pace, a loftie mind, and a quick hope: they giue her light winges, and a globe vnder her feete, in her hande a horne of aboundance, which ſhe powreth foorth vpon ſuch as pleaſeth her. Some put a wheele in her hand, which continually turneth, whereby they that are on the top, tumble down into the gulf of miſerie: as hiſtories are full of examples. Haniball that liued flouriſhing conqueror, died miſerablie by poiſon. Eumines one of Alexanders lieftenants, exalted to honour from a Potters ſome being taken priſoner, died of honger. Pertinex a ſouldiour came to the Empire being a poore womans ſonne, wherein raigning two monethes was ſlain by his gard. The Emperour Probus was the ſonne of a blacke ſmyth. Maximua of a Gardiner. Iohn Leyden a

butchers ſonne of Holland was proclaimed King, and raigned three yeares in great proſperite, and then ſubuerted. Lo this is ye ſtedfaſtnes of fortune, deſirous of change, whereby many are drawen by her ſweete proffers to pride, and many vilde grieuous ſinnes, to prouoke the Gods to wrath, who ſeeing their inſolencie throw them downe ſooner then they riſe, of purpoſe to make their ſtates more miſerable: let vs therefore wiſely waigh what Fortune is, and prepare our ſelues for all euents, for hee that is able to ſay, Fortune, I haue preuented thee, I haue ſtopped vp all thy paſſages, and cloſed vp all thy waies of enterance: that man putteth not his truſt in Fortune, but ioyeth in the diſcourſes of reaſon: riches, glorie, authoritie and honor reioiſe them moſt that ſtand leaſt in feare of their contraries. wherfore in deſpite of Fortune vertue flouriſheth. Then there is no good but vertue, and no euil but vice, which is the contrary to it. The vertuous man is only free and happy, the vitious man bond and vnhappie. Likewiſe beautie and the diſpoſition of the body, maieſtie and honors are al of no force: But prudence, magnanimity, & iuſtice are anchors of greateſt ſtay, which cannot be plucked vp by any tempeſt, and prooueth the ſayings of Socrates to bee true, that whole troupes of ſouldiours, and heaps of riches haue bene ſtrained often to yeeld to the enemies which haue truſted in fortune, contemning the maieſty of God: For wiſe was that noble prince Amcharſis a Barbarian, who was ſo deſirous to attaine vertue, that he left the kingdome of Silla to hys yoongeſt brother, and went into Graecia to profit with Solon: ſaieng, that Fortune ſhould neuer triumph ouer him, but he would triumph ouer Fortune. Theſe examples (Andrugio,) may draw thee to vertue, and contemne the world, perſiſt in thy dooing, reſpect not the worlde, nor take care for thy famylie, thy friend Galaſtino faithfull and kind to thee and thine, ſhall be to thy wife a huſband, and a father to thy fatherleſſe infantes: yea thou Galaſtino maiſt be in the world a mirrour, to giue directions of true friendſhip:

for beſides thy ſelfe there is not one on the whole earth: thou that ſhoweſt thy mind by thy deedes: Thou prince of Millaine art the true friend that Socrates preſcribeth to be the ineſtimable iewell of the world, not to bee valued by all the mortall things of the earth, which true friendſhip of thine maketh me happie in my vnhappines, and my diſtreſſed familie bleſſed, for whom I truſt in time, thy ſword ſhall make paſſage vnto the Dukedome of Saxonie, and there plant my ſonne Alphonſus to ſucceede his Father in his right, yelding vnto thoſe accurſed traitors & their ofſprings the reward of traitors.
               O friendly Galaſtino thou mirrour of men, whoſe worthineſſe cannot be valued, for thy faith and loyaltie to thy friend. Many in proſperitie like the fawning dogs wil follow a man, but in aduerſitie flie from him like the full gorges hawke. O world where is the faith and friendſhip that hath bene in times paſt amongſt men, taken from men becauſe of their ingratitude to God. Hyſtories tell vs of many which liued, offering both life, landes, goodes and what els for their friends, ſignes of true fidelity, as Ionathan for Dauid, we reade in holy wryt of their ieopardy one for the other, how often theyr friendſhip was approoued beetweene them, neither could the deſire of dignitie draw the affectionate loue & zeale of prince Ionathan from his Dauid, albeit he knew that Dauid ſhould ſucceed his father in the kingdome, he being his heir. So we reade of Achylles and patroclus, Oreſtes and pyllides, both of them calling themſelues by the name of Oreſtes, who was content to dy to ſaue the life of his companion. The like was Ephenus and Eneritus, and Damon and pythias of whoſe friendly loue Dyoniſius the tyrant ſeeing the prooffe, the one beeing ready to die for the other, pardoned them both.
               This is the tryall of true friendes: how many liueth at this day like thoſe: Ah none, the more may our harts grieue to think thereon. Ambition, couetonſneſſe, pride, and hatred are ſo crept into the hearts of men, that they contemne God

and his dooings, their fathers, kin and welwillers. How many men liue in theſe daies, that for a kingdome would not murder his prince, if he might do it without feare of death, which is a terrour to moſt men? How many men be there that for riches will not ſticke to rob Temples, prophane the name of God, vſe periurie, to the confounding of the honeſt and their poſteritie? yea, to inioy what their owne fathers haue, ſeeke vntimely to cut of their liues that firſt gaue thē breath? We daily ſee in our courts of iuſtice the father contend with thr ſonne, brother with brother, wife with huſband, and al eſtates one with another cannot content themſelues with their callings: all proceede from ambition, which is nothing but a deſire to inioy honours, eſtates and great places. Further, it is a vice of exceſſe, and contrary to modeſtie: for that man (as Ariſtotle ſaith) is modeſt, which deſireth honor as he ought, and as becommeth him, but hee that deſireth it by vnlawfull meanes is ambitious. Howe many treaſons hath there bin by ambitious men conſpired againſt their ſoueraignes? We read of Frederick the third who after hee had raigned thirtie yeares, was miſerably murthered by Manfroy his baſtard ſonne, whom hee had made prince of Trantinum, and after he had committed this paracide, poyſoned his owne brother Conradus yt he might make himſelfe king of Naples, Antonius & Geta ſucceſſors in the Empire to Seuerus their father, could not ſuffer one the other to enioy ſo large a monarchy: for Anton. flue his brother Geta wt a dagger yt he might rule alone. Soliman king of ye Turks, when he heard the ſhowtes of his armie yt they made for Sultan Muſtipha his ſon, he cauſed him to be ſecretly ſtrangled in his chamber: & preſently (being dead) to be caſt out before his army, cauſing this ſpeach to be vttered with a loud voice, there was but one God in heauen, and one Sultan vpon earth: within two daies after he cauſed his ſecond ſonne Sultan Soba to die, for yt he wept for his brother and Sultan Mahomet his third ſonne becauſe he fled for feare, leauing but one of his race aliue to ſucceed him.
               
                  
Theſe are but the familiar examples of ambition in reſpect of thoſe that cauſe men to put innocentes to deathe, that they may the ſurer grow and increaſe: but no doubt for the moſt part, iuſt puniſhment follow the ambitious, for example to others, whereof there are vnfaigned hiſtories, which mention the ſame. Marcus Craeſſus, the richeſt man of his time, iealous of Caeſars glorie, at the age of threeſcore yeares, lead with a vaine hope of conqueſt, vndertooke the warres againſt Arſaces, king of the Parthians, in which warres himſelfe was miſerably ſlame, with twenty thouſand of his men, and ten thouſand taken priſoners. Marcus Marlius was for the like occaſion throwne downe from a rocke, and brake his necke. Oh that men would conſider the fruits of ambition? who would then willingly offend? for as the wiſe man ſaith, (cōparing them to ſmoke diſperſed with the wind) deſire nothing more then to runne out their race in continuall cares, and miſeries and calamities, depriuing themſelues of all liberty, and which is worſt, pawning their ſoules, to an eternall and moſte miſerable thraldome.
               Thus let vs deteſt ambition whiche is an infinite euill, and companion of pride, ſo muche hated of God and men: let vs conſider that wiſe precept whiche is written by the learned Tarian, to Plutarcke, I enuie (ſayde this good Prince) Scipio Africanus, and Marcus Porcinus more for their contempt of offices, then for the victories they haue gotten, becauſe a conquerour, is for the moſte part in fortunes power, but the contempt of officers, and refuſall of honours conſiſteth onely in preiudice: let vs marke well this one ſaying of Titus, who vſing continuall ſithinges at meate and elſwhere, being demanded the cauſe, ſaid, I cannot keepe my ſelfe from ſighing and complaining, when I call to minde, that this great honour which I haue, is not certaine but moueable, that my eſtates and dignities are in ſequeſtration, and my life as it were layde in pawne or pledged vnto me. Let the ſaying of the good Philip, Prince

of Macedonie, be well noted of great men, who one day falling in a place where wreſtling was exerciſed, beholding his bodie printed in the duſt, good Lord (quoth he) how litle ground muſt we haue by nature, and yet we deſire all the habitable world. Thus Andrugio, in thy ſollitarie life, thou muſt (hauing nought els to do) call to minde what (in ſtudie) thou haſt read, and in the bitter griefe of thy heart bewayle them that liue in thoſe daies of miquitie, and note how God ſuffereth all ſortes of people to raygne, giuing triall by his aboundant giftes to all eſtates, ſome to rule, ſome to obey, ſome to wealth, ſome to want, ſome to ſickeneſſe, and all to proue either their aſpiring heartes, by promotions, or their patience by trouble, whereof thou Andrugio haſt iuſt experience, whiche being yoong in reſpect of the aged, for yeares, haſt continually taſted the rod of hys wrath: yet thankes to him that frameth my heart to beare with patience this croſſe of pouertie, for in the ende ſhall it fall out with me the better: in this contented life, ſhall I be better pleaſed, then with al the aboundance of the world: for riches prouoke manie infirmities, which worldlings thinke not vppon, eſpecially to the couetous minded, of whome Ariſtotle ſaith, the couetous man deſireth to haue from all parts without reaſon, and vniuſtly withholdeth that which belongeth to another: he is ſparing and ſcantiue in giuing, but exceſſiue in receauing: the couetous man is neuer contented, but the more he hath, ye more deſireth: the medicine golde, and ſiluer, which he ſeeketh increaſeth his diſeaſe, as water doth the dropſie, and may moſt rightly be compared to mules, which carrie vpon their backes, great ſtore of gold and treaſure, yet eat nothing but hay. They indure labour in procuring, but want the pleaſure of inioying: they inioy: neither reſt nor libertie, whiche is of wiſe men moſte deſired, but liue alwaies like ſlaues to their riches. Their greateſt miſerie is, that to increaſe and keepe their wealth, they care neither for equitie nor iuſtice, yea, for riches they contemne both God and man, and all threatninges, and puniſhmentes

God hath pronounced againſt them, they liue without friendſhip and charitie, and lay hold on nothing but gaine, when they are placed in authoritie aboue others, they condemne the innocent, and finde alwaies ſome cleanly cloke to their bribing, making no difference, betwixt iuſtice and profite, wherefore we may well ſay, that couetouſneſſe is the roote of all euill, for what miſchiefe is there not procured through this vice, from whence ſpringes quarrels, ſtrifes, ſutes, hatred and enuie, theftes, polling, ſacking, warres, murders, and poyſoninges, but from hence God is forgotten, our neighbours hated, yea manie times the ſonne forgiueth not the father, nor the brother, the brother: nor the ſubiect the Lord, for deſire of gaine (O execrable impietie to be well thought of amongeſt vs,) it cauſeth men to breake their faith giuen, to violate all friendſhip, to betray their countrie and ſubiects, to rebell againſt their Prince, but note how manie miſchiefes couetouſneſſe hath attempted: Mulcaſſes king of thiues, had his eyes by hys owne ſonne put out, that he might ceaſe vppon his riches: Polimneſtor, ſonne to Priamus of Troy, ſlew his kinſman Polidorus, to gaine golde, for the which Queene Hecuba, comming vnto him, without anie ſhewe of diſcontentment, hauing him alone in a chamber, with the helpe of her women, thruſt out his eyes. The Emperour Caligula was ſo muche touched with couetouſneſſe, that there was no meane to get money, how vnlawfull ſoeuer it were, which he ſought not out, inſomuch that he layd a tribute vppon 
                     Ʋrine, and ſolde his ſiſters gownes, whome he had baniſhed, yet in one yeare of his raigne, he ſpent prodigally 67. millions of gold, which Tyberius his predeceſſour had gathered together, I call now to minde the remedie of a couetous cardinall, who vſed when his horſekeepers had giuen otes to his horſes, to come downe all alone by a trap dore without light into the ſtable, and ſteale their otes, and carried them into his Garner, whereof hee kept the key himſelfe ſo long as he continued this goinges and comminges

that one of his horſekeepers, not knowing who was the theefe, hid himſelf in the ſtable, and taking him at the deed doing, with a pitchforke, ſo baſted him that he left hym for dead, ſo that he was faine to be carried by foure men into his chamber. Theſe with manie other examples may moue vs to open the inward meaning of the heart, by true prayer to the giuer of all goodneſſe, and learne with modeſtie the heaping vp of worldly treaſures, for godlineſſe with contentation is great gaine, and let all Chriſtians procure that God may be worſhipped, duetie and reuerence giuen to ſuperiours, concord be amongeſt equalles, diſcipline to be vſed towards inferiours, patience towards enemies, mercie towardes the poore: but men puft with pride, ambition, couetouſneſſe and al vile ſinnes, ſhew themſelues ingratefull to God their maker, a vice odious in the ſight of God and men: for note firſt, Adam hauing an vnthankefull mi
                     •
                  de to his creator, did eat the forbidden fruite contrary to his expreſſe commandement, to whome he owed all obedience: thus as by his ingratitude he neglected his obedience to his Lord, ſo his puniſhment was according to the maner of his offence, for his owne ſpirites, which were before at his commandement, rebelled againſt him, and led him to all kinde of ſinne, which maketh vs inheritours of hys curſe, both of ſinne and death, yet ſo dull is our vnderſtanding, that dayly we fal into this crime of ingratitude, which we ought to hate in great meaſure, and to flie from it more then death it ſelfe, by reaſon of the euils whiche it hath brought vppon vs: but yet alas, wee ſee amongeſt vs too many vngrateful perſons, who betraye them ſooneſt by whome they receaue all their liuing and aduancement. And if vnthankfulneſſe be familiar with the meaner ſorte, let vs not thinke it farther off from thoſe of higher calling, for vppon euerie light occaſion, eſpecially if a man frame not himſelfe to that vice, which they haue in greateſt commendation, they eaſily forget all the ſeruice that hath bene done vnto them, by reaſon of ſome new come gueſt, who

                  we himſelf a ſeruiceable miniſter of their pleaſures this hapneth ſoneſt whē men grow in greatnes, becauſe cō
                  monly as their calling increaſe (not being inſtructed in vertue) they wax worſe and worſe in behauiour, but let them take this for an infallible rule, that an vnthankfull perſon cannot long retaine in his ſeruice an honeſt faithfull & good ſeruant. The ancient ſaid not without good cauſe, that impudencie was the companion of ingratitude, for if no beaſt (as they ſay) is ſo ſhameleſſe as an impudent, who is he that may be ſaid to haue leſſe ſhame thē an vnthankful body, for this cauſe of ingratitude. Among the ſawes of Draco eſtabliſhed among the Athenians, there was this, that if any man had receiued a benefit of his neighbor, & it were prooued againſt him, that he had not bene thankful for it, it was death to the offendor.
               
                  Alexander the greateſt for bountie, and Caeſar for pardoning iniuries renowmed in all the hiſtories: of them both it is ſaide, that when Alexander had knowledge of an vnthankfull perſon he neuer gaue him any thing: nor Caeſar neuer forgaue ſuch. So grieuouſly haue vertuous men hated ingratitude. Yt is reported of the Storke that ſhe neuer bringeth foorth yoong ones but ſhee caſteth one out of the neſt for the hier of the houſe where ſhe lodgeth. But barbarous is that ingratitude in him that hath bene borne, bred, foſtered and ſerued, and all with the ſweate of another mans browes in the end to ſeke the ſpoile of al that is therin, euen the honor, and oftimes the life of the Hoſt. Wonderfull are the miſchiefes that happen to the vnthankfull, & many be the examples of the ſorrowes and puniſhents that haue followed ingratitude. Now if we deſire to ſhunne this vile ſinne, and to imitate the vertues of the noble minded to our vtmoſt power, this is our help if we alwaies eſteeme the benefit which we receiue of another greater then it is, & repute that we giue for leſſe then the worth, neither let vs as proud and vaine glorious men doo, who vaunt that they ſtand in need of none, diſdayn to receiue a pleaſure of

our friends, although they be of leſſe calling then we, when they deſire our friendſhip, for if it be an honeſt thing to doo good to all, that cannot be diſhoneſt at all, for in requitall of friendſhip, a receiuer is as requiſite as a giuer. Furthermore, this one other poynt, to baniſh this vilde ſinne from amongſt men, if we requite double the good turne wee receiue one of another. Laſtlie let vs recompence double, and reward without reckoning thoſe good turnes which we receiue of others, rather fearing leaſt we ſhould be ouercome in Benificence then in worldly reputation and glory.
               But wretched Andrugio, the more thou entereſt into thoſe grieuous calamities of the world, the more thou calleſt to mind thy hard hap, and more, greeueſt to thinke of thy ſweete Suſania, and her tender babes then of thine own penurie. But God which is iuſt, will with vengeance reward thoſe traiterous reprobates which haue depriued their lawfull prince from his ſeat of iuſtice and maieſtie, compelling him to ſeeke curteſie wher he may beſt get it, but worſe ſhall befal them then that traiterous prince Iuſtinian, who ſelling for lucar of the kingdom the famous city of conſtantinople, was crowned there and after three daies had his head cut off. paſanias a Captaine of Lacedemon, hauing receiued fiue hundred duckets to betray the citie of Sparta, was by his father purſued to a church, whether he fled for ſanctuarie, who commanded the walles to be cloſed, and ſo famiſhed him, and afterwards his mother caſt his body to the dogs. Brutus caſsius that would haue betraied Rome was in the ſame maner ſerued. Darius king of Perſia cauſed his ſonne Aariabarzā
                   his head to be cut off, becauſe he ſought to betray his army to Alexander. Brutus did the like to his ch

               If thoſe noble Princes rewarded treaſon, by the deaths of their children and moſt fauoured, then thinke not but your liues will be ſhortened for your conſpiracie againſt me: yea, aſſure you that the righteous iudge of men wil puniſh

it in you, as he hath done in many others. The remēbrance of your crimes, with the thoughtes of iuſt iudgment to bee inflicted vpon you, driueth my oppeſſed heart into a world of griefe: but if I had ſearched ſo narrowly into the thoughts of you (accurſed Traitors) I had bene happy in this my vnhappines, but wiſe men haue taught mee that miſerie is neceſſarie.
               That man (ſaith the wiſe man Bias) is able to beare miſerie which hath bene trained in the ſame from his youth. And Dyoniſius the elder ſaid, that man that hath learned from his youth to be vnhappie, ſhal bear his yoke the better which hath ben ſubiect to it in times paſt.
               
                  Demetrius ſaid, that he iudged none more vnhappy thē he which neuer taſted of aduerſitie. And Cicero iudgeth him moſt happy that thinketh no miſerie how grieuous ſoeuer it be, or intollerable, or dooth any way diſcourage him. Nothing (ſaith plutarch) is euill that is neceſſarie: by which word neceſſary, Cicero vnderſtandeth whatſoeuer hapneth a man by deſtinie, is neceſſarie, and we ought to beare it with patience as that can not bee auoided. Socrates ſpeaking with a deuine ſpirit ſaid, yt when we ſhal be deliuered from this body wherein the ſoule is, as an oyſter in yt ſhel, we may then be happy, but not ſooner: and that felicitie can not be obtained in this life, but that we muſt hope to enioy it perfectly in an other life. Yf death be the happines of men, how happie had I bene, if in my cradle I had paide the due I owe vnto death, the ioies which follow death, if our fraile nature could conceiue, and allow were ſuch comfort to al as wel to the happy, as the miſerable, that none would deſire life: for my owne part hauing tried the happines of worldly men, riches, of couetouſneſſe ſo called, and conſider the frailtie of it, and the abuſe of men, I choſe in theſe deſerts to abandon me from al humaine fellowſhip, coſtly fare & ſoft lodging, loſing the company of my louing wife, & tender infants, liuing wt ſuch roots & other things as ye earth yeeldeth, for yt I haue ſeene ye tyrannies vſed toward ye poor

But reſolued I am in deſpite of fortune (whoſe banding bal from my infancie I haue bene) to continue the remainder of my life in this ſweete contentation: for as ſhe (moſt blinde and fained Goddeſſe) hath taken my honors, my goods and worldly dignities may driue me in diſgrace with the people, but ſhe cannot make my honeſt mind

                  FLodericus, and his fellow companions, ruling now in Saxony, thought themſelues ſure of their ſeates, hauing baniſhed all thoſe that might claime by right, any title in the Dukedome, vſurping ambitious titles, and galling theyr commons with taxes, and all other maner of pollinges, that their ſubiectes rather did chuſe to die then liue in that ſeruitude: yet remedie was none, eaſe thēſelues they could not, but grouing vnder that heauie yoke, whereto they were bound: Beſeeche God, who ſheweth mercie to all people, to take their cauſe in hand, and reuenge the baniſhment of their good Duke vppon thoſe tyrantes, and their progenie, whoſe Lamentations, and ſorrowfull playntes, ſo often powred forth, yet it pleaſed the Lord to heare, and as he deliuered his children Iſraell from the thraldome of Egipt, Hieruſalem from the bondage of Babilon, ſo rayſed hee vp that famous noble prince Galaſtino Duke of Millaine, to reuenge the wronges, offered his friend and lawfull Prince Andrugio, and relieue his poore ſubiectes, which liued in great thraldome long time, with earneſt inquirie being ſpent by Galaſtino, in ſearching out the abode of his Andrugio, who could not be heard of: for all that might be done, for whoſe abſence the ſorrowe that was made, is not to be tolde. When Galaſtino ſawe all diligence that could be vſed, might not bring him tidinges of the Duke, he ſommoneth all his nobles & counſell togither,

beſeeching their friēdly aduiſe, in a matter of waight, which he ſhoulde impart vnto them, the nobles that with duetie loued him, and whoſe zeale was ſuch as becommeth ſubiectes to their ſoueraignes, humblie ſought his excellencie to declare what hee had to ſay, promiſing to their vtmoſt power, to counſell him therein, with all the furtherance they could, & accompliſh in anie reaſonable ſort, what hee ſhould require, Gala

                  tino who found his nobles, as euer before, duetifull and readie to obey his will, gaue them all moſte hartie thankes for the ſame, and after a little pauſe taking, thus ſayd.
            Nobles and you ſtates of Millaine, it is not vnknowne vnto you all, in what miſerable ſeruitude the poore ſubiects of my good friend the duke of Saxonie, haue and doth liue ſince the exile of their lawfull Duke, by thoſe vſurping Miſcreantes, which haue nowe the gouernment, whoſe wrong offered their liege Lord, and my friend, I am determined to reuenge, neither will I willingly ſuffer men of ſo vile condition to liue, that wrongeth their ſoueraigne, whome God hath placed, nor ſuffer the innocent babes, of ſo honourable a prince, as the duke of Saxonie, to loſe their rightfull inheritance in the Dukedome, my ſelfe that inioy amongſt you my birthright, and title of this countrey, haue many heyres to ſucceed me, when my earthly truncke ſhall yeeld his due to death, vnto whome I cannot deuine what may be offered, yet hope the beſt, and relie vpon your fidelities, whome I haue euer found loyall, but if the deuill, by ambition, wherewith hee infecteth manie of high eſtate, ſhould tempt you in ſuch ſorte, not to be content with their degree, and ſhould procure the vulgar ſorte, to vſe the like crueltie to mine, the memorie of my actions and zeale, in defending innocentes, remayning freſh in memorie, may be a terrour vnto thoſe ſo euill diſpoſed, who waying their wicked pretence, before they beginne, may aſſure themſelues that God which is righteous, will rayſe ſome one, of noble diſpoſition, to reuenge their wronges, as by hys ſufferance

I am nowe drawne to the like in the behalfe of thoſe two children of my friend: the noble duke of Saxonie, for whom (on my honor) my care is as much as for mine own, neither wil I alter my determinatiō herein, to be made a monarche of the worlde, but to my vtmoſt power, will ſo proſecute, what I determine herein, that in the cauſe I wil aduenture my perſon, where ſuch as loue me, will follow me.
            The nobles which noted howe earneſt the duke was in vttering his long oration, thought it no time to delay their opinions, what they iudged of the enterpriſe, yet were they driuen to a non plus, what to anſwere ſo ſodainly: to denie his demandes and earneſt requeſt, might bréede ſuſpition of their loyaltie, then which they rather chuſe to die: againe to aggrauate him, to the attempt which was before, ſo hotely bent, was but to put oyle to quenche the fire, wherefore after ſmall deliberation, they anſwered.
            Honourable Lord, whoſe will hath bene held amongſt vs for law, Know dread ſoueraigne, that we haue with aduiſe conſidered of your long proteſtation, and moſt highly commend in you ſo honourable a minde, and haue noted what honour it will be, to you and your poſteritie for euer, to regard the eſtate of the widdow & fatherleſſe, ſuch we terme that diſtreſſed good Ladie, the ducheſſe of Saxonie and her infantes, for whome wée haue often bene minded to intreate, as in honour we are bound, that they inioying their right, might eaſe your maieſtie of a great charge, and requite on thoſe rebellious traytors, a facte ſo odious according to their deſertes, knowing that traytors, whiche ſeeke the ſubuerſion of their prince, ought not to liue. Holie writ ſheweth manie examples, howe God puniſhed ſuche vſurpers, where is commaunded that none ſhall lift theyr ſword againſt their annoynted, who on the earth are his vice regen

               es. Dauid when Saule ſought his life, came into the tent of the king, finding him ſleeping, yet durſt not touch him, for feare of vengeance from heauen. If treaſon were helde in ſuch contempt in thoſe dayes, howe ought it

much more now to be deſpiſed, Proceede therefore, noble Prince, and let the tender care you haue of theſe innocents whoſe cauſe you take in hand, deſerue ſuch honour, in the courtes of all chriſtian Princes, that no talke may be, but of Galaſtino, duke of Millaine, and his honourable reuenge of thoſe traytors, that draw their ſwordes againſt their ſoueraigne: and hauing vanquiſhed, the villaines, let their puniſhmēt be anſwerable to their deſerts, that it may breed terrour to all ſuch as ſhall euer attempt the like action, and remaine to the end of all thinges, in memorie: towardes the performance of which, of our own coſt, we freely allow ten thouſand men, well furniſhed for warre, with all ye charge, wages, and what elſe to them belongeth, beſides our owne perſons, to attend your excellencie, which ſhalbe readie, ſpeedily awaiting your gracious pleaſures.
            The Duke which found no leſſe then hee expected at the handes of his nobles, was ſo rauiſhed with ioy, that it amazed him, wherfore yelding them ſuch honourable courteſie, as their large and friendly offer required, he thus replied.
            Noble friends, on whoſe fidelitie our welfare conſiſteth, Thankes for this friendſhip, & ſo likewiſe for many others paſt: more haue you honoured me by your conſent to this my fi

               te, then I liſt nowe to vtter, but aſſure you on the word and maieſtie of a Prince, that your friendſhips ſhall neuer be forgotten. Touching my determination for our iournie to Saxonie, knowe that our purpoſe is (by the aſſiſtance of God, whome I truſt fauoureth our good intent, and will helpe vs according to equitie of our cauſe) within two monethes, to be ready for our intended voyage, wherefore, as you honour me, ſee that you accompliſhe your late offers, againſt that time prefixed, vnto whiche they faythfully promiſe. dinner time Drawing on, the ducheſſe aduertiſed the duke therof, who inuited his nobles thereto, where the Duke relateth vnto the ducheſſe of Saxonie his parlie with the nobles of Millaine, with their courteous offers, for the benefite of her, and her children: which newes was ſo

pleaſing vnto her, as nothing could ioy her more, hoping by that meanes the Duke her huſbands children ſhoulde inioy their lawfull right, and ſhee her ſelfe liue to ſee the ſame. Thus with much pleaſant parly paſſed they diner, carowſing to their happyſucceſſe and fortunate iorney, vntil ſome of them haue taken ſuch colde in the handes, that they might not ſtand on their feet. Time that worketh al things commandeth theſe Nobles away, e

               ch making to their home: wherefore taking humble leaue of the Duke and the two Duches, thy depart, carefull of what the Duke gaue them in charge, to ſet all thinges in a readines againſt the time appointed,
            The Nobles gone, the Duke calleth his captaines, and men fit for charge, geuing them warrant for leuieng his power, with great command that his company ſhould bee of the beſt and ableſt men in the Dukedome, which with care they ſee fulfilled, according to the truſte repoſed in them.
            The Ducheſſe for whoſe ſake thoſe preparations were made, conceiued ſuch ioy at the ſame, that ſhe thought euery moneth a yeare, and euery day a moneth, vntil ſhee ſaw to what happy end the Dukes pretended iorney would happē vnto, often commending in her heart the faithfulneſſe of the Duke of Millaine to his friend. In recounting whereof ſhe ſhed many bytter teares for Andrugio her beloued lord and huſband, ſomtime exclaiming againſt both Gods and men, for his loſſe who ſo dearely ſhe loued. The remembrance of whom was likely diuers times to bereaue her of life, yet in the midſt of her ſorrowes, when ſhe beheld the yoong prince, a liuely picture of the exiled Duke, how often with ſweet imbracings woulde ſhe kiſſe the tender youth, bathing his tender cheeks with teares diſtilling in aboundance, thorow extreame griefe of heart from her eies, hoping yet before death ſhould ſhut thoſe eyes of hers to ſee him, and once againſt to inioy his companie.
            The yoong prince growing to ſome diſcretion, beeing

thirteen yeares of age, well noting the ſorrowe and heauineſſe of his mother, would by cyrcumſtances enquyre of the Duke his father, of his country, and the cauſe why hee left the ſame, with many other queſtions, of which when the Ducheſſe had reſolued him, & made relation of each thinge which he demanded, deſcribing alſo at full, how dearly hys ſubiectes loued him, and in what regard they held her, it would moue the prince often to ſhed teares, wiſhing that his years had bene ſuch that he might haue remembred his father, and of power to reuenge his wrong, vowing if it bee the pleaſure of God to endow him with life, ſo thorowly to requite thoſe iniuries vpon the vſurping traitors, that al the chronicles in the world ſhould record the ſame in memorie. And ſo comforteth his mother in the beſt ſort hee could, praying her a while to be content, till God had placed him in his right, whereof he hoped in ſhort time to bee poſſeſſed.
            Thoſe wordes of comfort proceeding from ſo greene a head: the Ducheſſe did much admyre, & no doubt had greate pleaſure in her ſonne, of whom ſhe had no litle ioy, whoſe education was anſwerable to his byrth, hauing learned men of all ſciences to read vnto him, by whome hee profited in learning ſo excellently, that it was rare to finde any in Millaine, or the whole Dukedom comparable vnto him for ſtudy and other agility of the body, for which he bare the prize from al of his yeares, whoſe conditions were ſo anſwerable to the noble Duke his father, that if any man did know the one, would ſuppoſe ſoone who the other ſhould be.
            Whileſt the Duke of Millaine was furniſhing his power, newes was brought him, that Flodericus one of the vſurpers had by poiſon brought his companion vnto his longeſt home: to auenge whoſe wrongs Sextilius ſon and heir vnto Gonſalo deceiſed, had gathered all his allies, kindred and friends in armes, and was in the fieldes with intent to ſuppreſſe Flodericus, and claime in right the Duke dome in trueth and lawfull ſucceſſion belonging vnto neyther of them.

Such haſt was made on all ſides, that ere Phoebus ſhowed his glittering beames on the earth, the Duke with all his power were landing, & by his leaders, (who had viewed the City) made choiſe of their ground to encampe in, where they fall to worke at all handes, trenching, furniſhing of tentes, and buyldinge of Eabinn

This newes was worſe welcome then the former behalfe, and ſtroke ſuch a terrour in Flodericus, that as one diſpairing of his euill intent, hee breaketh out into theſe ſpeeches.
            
               Flodericus, thou ſeeſt now, that to gouerne a ſtate is to be cares Captiue: vncertaine is the ſtate gotten by guyle, and diſpoyling thy friend: what man haſt thou euer ſeene to proſper with any thing gotten by treacherie: Then howe canſt thou hope of any good more, with quietnes to be poſſeſſed in this Dukdome, which thou by treaſon inioyeſt? No, no Flodericus, blood requireth blood, he which draweth his ſword againſt his Soueraigne, ſhall periſh by the ſame. Yf this ſaying be true, as no doubt it is, then miſerable man, what ſhall become of thee, which haſt not onely exiled thy prince, his Lady and ſweete children, but put thy friend who loued thee to death: vengeance therefore is thy meede, and ſhamefull will be thy end. Miſerable Flodericus, whoſe hap is now ſo harn as thine, which ſhalt be now inforced to reſigne that, which by vnlawfull meanes thou didſt force vpon thy ſelfe? Ah ambition, I ſee now how like a worme thou graweſt vppon the heart vnill thou haue eaten it aſunder. Ambition led me to thoſe miſchiefes, who might haue leuied in mine owne eſtate a principall member of my country, beloued and feared: yea, and whoe was it that I might not command? but repentance commeth too late, wretched man, yet ſeeke the ſafetie of thy countryman, let not their blood bee ſhed for thy offence, But yeeld thee vnto the mercie of them, whoſe comming (queſtionles) is to be reuenged on thee.
            Oh Andrugio, noble Duke and rightfull heir to this Dukedome, would God I did know wher thou or thine remaine (if any of you breath life) that I might (acknowledging my dutie pilgrimlike on my bare feete) traueile to finde you and bring you to your owne poſſeſſions.
            But vaine it is for mee to make lamention for his loſſe

Confuſion ſhall fall vpon thee, and vpon all traytors, who cannot liue long, but God will roote out. Ah Flodericus, where was the remembrance of this thou now rehearſeſt, when thou didſt firſt attempt this odious fact, vilde in ye ſight of God and men, by whoſe iuſtice thou ſhalt be pulled downe, and thy poſteritie rooted from the dukedome of Saxonie: but woulde to God that were the worſt, Then ſhould I offer my necke to the ſword of thoſe that ſeek my bloud, and ſo make an atto

Oh yt I had periſhed in my mothers wombe, or that being borne, I had neuer liued, to attaine the ſtate of a man. In vaine waſte I theſe friuolous ſpeeches, Linger not the time Flodericus, ſuffer not thy ſubiectes to be ſpoiled, nor thy countrie ruinated, thou knoweſt ſtrangers in a forraigne countrie hold all their owne they lay hand on, and what is there gotten, is well gotten: miſerable is that land, where ſtrangers in warlike ſorte follow their enſignes, conſider therefore the harmes which may be done to thy people, and ſend to the campè to knowe their pleaſure, and what they demand, ſo ſhalt thou be the ſooner aduiſed, whether it is beſt to defend thee by armies, or by ſubmiſſion, yeeld thee vnto his mercie, if they come in right of Sextillianus, why then, my title is as good as hys, who were both vſurpers of anothers right, if in the behalfe of our lawfull Duke, why then yeeld thee. Would God it were ſo, then ſhould I neuer ſtand on tearmes, but reſigne his dukedome, who being of noble and honourable diſpoſition,

might receiue me to mercie, if not my ſelfe, yet will not puniſhe my babes for the fathers offence. This reſtrained by the aboundance of teares, iſſuing from his eies, he endeth his ſorrowfull oration, determining, in all haſte to diſpatche a meſſenger to the campe, that he might be aduertiſed what they were, and there demandes, which accordingly was accōpliſhed: the meſſenger making ſmall haſt, the duke of Millaine was come to the walles before that he could get out, and had ſommoned the ſame, of whome the Citizens craue parlie, which he granted, and vpon hoſtage deliuered for his ſecuritie, entered the ſame, where in the counſell houſe, the chiefeſt and

Nobles and you ſubiects to the lawfull heyres of Saxony, know that I come as a friend to your duke and you, not as an enemie, if you yeeld to what in right I haue to ſay vnto you all, it is not vnknown, how moſt trayterouſly theſe vſurping rec

But to aduertiſe you, wherefore I come in armes as you ſee, is in the right and maintenance of the ducheſſe, and the prince her ſonne: Who by me, haue bene ſince their exile releeued, and by me as I am bound by law of armes and conſcience, ſhalbe againe eſtabliſhed in their right, or I and my followers will leaue our liues in the cauſe. Therefore my Lords, aduiſe you whether you will ſee the ruine of your countrie, or receaue your Prince, as rightfull heire, and deliuer that vſurper Flodericus into my handes. I craue but right, as your ſelues can iudge, wherefore let me haue anſwere to my content, and haue peace, or otherwiſe ſtand vpon your defence, for this is my reſolute determination. The nobles of Saxonie, which were friendes to Andrugio,
               
and the commons were ioyfull at the hart to heare the duke report the cauſe of his comming, hoping that God had ſent him to cure that heauie griefe of heart, which generally they indured. But the contrarie part was not a little appaled to heare this newes, wherefore they craue ſome time to determine of their anſwere. To which he willingly conſenteth, giuing two dayes libertie for the ſame, in which time he demandeth to be reſolued, wtout longer delay, that he might aſſure himſelfe of peace or warre. Thus hauing deliuered the cauſe of his comming, hee departed to the campe, where hee cauſed to be proclaymed, that no ſouldier of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer, ſhoulde commit anie maner of outrage againſt anie of the country whatſoeuer, neither imbeſſell the goodes or cattels of them or any of them, on paine of looſing his head.
            The Duke hauing taken his leaue, Flodericus was aduertiſed what hee demanded, whoſe heart ſuſpecting as much before (as guiltie conſciences be timorous) was not a little greeued: yet he conſidered that the right was none of his, and therefore could not aſſure himſelfe of his ſubiects, who hated him for diuers cauſes: Beſides, the life of Gonſalo, whom he had cauſed to be murdered, ſtroke a greater feare to his heart then before: wherefore doubtfull what to doe, at length reſolueth by the citizens, to returne the duke of Millaine his determinate anſwere, for the which he ſpeedily diſpatcheth meſſengers, vnto whome, when they were all aſſembled, he ſaith.
            My louing friendes and countrimen, the time is nowe come, that God hath determined to cut me off, no longer to gouerne you, the which I haue long expected, yet had not grace to lament my life paſt, wherefore his rod is readie lifted vp againſt me and my houſe, whoſe ruine is at hand which euer hath bene noble, now ſhall it be made miſerable and ignoble, my ſelfe the cauſe, which haue procured the ſame.

            Hauing ſet all thinges in order, The nobles who before had determined to receaue him in very braue maner departed the citie, to the Campe of the Duke, who hearing by an embaſſadour, before diſpatched, of their comming, came out to meete them, whome on their knees, the Lordes and Citizens, beſeeche of mercie, and in their Dukes

behalfe, whoſe by right it was, to enter the citie, and receiue the gouernment.
            Small intreatie ſerued to perſwade the Duke, who ſought not their harmes in any ſort: wherefore taking direction for his armies, acompanied with the chiefeſt of hys traine and Captaines, he entered the citie, where hee was royally entertained, and conducted to the Courte where Flodericus and his company with ſorrowe attended the ſentence of death.
            The duke being thus with honor in their princes behalf entertained, gaue thankes vnto them all, exhorting them to continue truſty and faithfull to their duke and his lawful inheritor, aſſuring them, that God who had euer defended the right, would alwaies fauour the innocent, and ſubuert the Traitor. Great ioy was there throughout the region of Saronie for this happy tydings, where Alphonſus ſon and heir to Andrugio was proclaimed duke, at which euery man reioyſed.
            The Duke ſeeing all thinges brought in ſuch happy maner to his content, & ſaw that the people in faithfull wiſe were linked to the prince, he diſcharged the moſt of his ſoldiers, and gaue order to his nobles for the prince Alphonſus, whome with the Ducheſſe he commanded with all expedition yt might be, ſhould come to receiue their right, aduertiſing them by letters of his good ſucceſſe, and how the peoples heartes were bent to honor them.
            This done he commanded Flodericus to be brought to his preſence, whome honorablie he vſed, commanding him to ſit down by him, where hee declared how vnhonorablie he had dealt by his noble friend Duke Andrugio, in exiling him and his children, vſurping his right, whereunto he had no tytle, with many examples howe God had puniſhed the like offences in many, and that doubtleſſe God would puniſh an offence ſo hainous on him and his poſteritie.
            
               Flodericus, whoſe conſcience accuſed him of as much as the Duke had ſaid, could not excuſe his fault, which was too

well knowen, neither did he craue life for himſelfe, for that he expected the contrarie, but beſought the Duke, howſoeuer it ſhould pleaſe his excellencie to deale with him, to take compaſſion on his tender children, whom he hoped woulde become good ſubiectes, and being warned by his vnhappie fall, prooue faithfull to the eſtate for euer.
            The Duke whoſe heart was mooued to pitie, taking no pleaſure in his death, neither the ſubu

               rtion of his houſe which was alwaies noble, wherefore ſhowing his noble mind and inclination to pitie, pronounceth his dome on this maner.
            
               Flodericus vſurper of the lawfull right and tytle of thy late liege Lord, the honorable Duke Andrugio: I do in requitall of thy diſhonorable fact, baniſh thee and thine from this thy natiue countrie of Saxonie, neuer to returne vpon paine of death, vnleſſe it ſhal pleaſe God thou find the duke and canſt intreat him to come and inioy his right and gouernment of this countrie, thy children and lady after tenne yeares to inioy their patrimonie, what euer become of thee: Fourtie daies libertie I giue thee to prouide things beſeeming thy eſtate, after which time not to be ſeene in this dominion vpon paine of thy life.
            
               Flodericus hearing the iudgement of the Duke, was ioyed at the heart to eſcape with life, which had deſerued death in the moſt extreameſt maner, wherefore humblie yeelding thankes for his gracious clemencie, he departeth his preſence.
            The Duke hauing taken this order with Flodericus hearing Sextillius Gonſalo his ſonne had not yet diſlodged his campe, ſommoneth him by a Her aught to come and yeeld to his mercie, or otherwiſe without fauour to receiue his deſert the Her aught omitting no time til he came to ye campe of Sextillius, deliuereth his meſſage, whō 
               Sextillius entertaineth honorablie: and hauing heard what fauour the Duke had ſhowed to Flodericus, he ſtandeth not

now vpon tearms, but made proclaimation that euery man ſhould depart to his home, and he himſelf would procure the Dukes pardon for them all, or yeeld his life for them, this done, enerie man at the firſt warning, glad to bee eaſed of their toile, and more ioyful of their yoong Dukes returne, preſently depart with bag and baggage.
            When Sextillius came before the Duke, who had examined the cauſe of his inſurrection to be in the reuenge of his father, murdered by Flodericus, hee was the ſooner perſwaded to receiue him to mercie: wherefore in hope that he would become a dutifull ſubiect and acknowledge Alphonſus ſonne and heire to Andrugio his lawfull prince and ſhow the like ſigne of obedience, he pardoneth his fault & honorablie entertaineth him, pardoning alſo al ſuch as had offended with him.
            
               Sextillius ſeeing the noble minde of the Duke of Myllaine, humbly thanketh his excellencie for this vndeſerued fauour, & taking oath for his loyaltie had leaue to depart at his pleaſure.
            The fortunate ſucceſſe of ye Millain Duke was brought vnto the Ducheſſe Suſania, whoſe heart you may ſuppoſe was not alitle ioy full to heare the ſame: wherefore according to yt dukes pleaſure ſhe haſtneth to him with as much ſpeede as might be. All thinges for their iourney being ready, the Ducheſſe with the prince Alphonſus her ſonne, geuing great thanks to the Ducheſſe for her friendſhip ſhewed in their extremitie, a happy gale began to blow, which by the Nobles to the Ducheſſe declared, ſhe ſlacketh no opportunity, but taking her leau
