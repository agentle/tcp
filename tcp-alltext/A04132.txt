CVM PRIVILEGIO.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            Consideration of man hym selfe.
            
               O Man know thy selfe,
know what thou art,
knowe thy beginning
why thou were borne,
vnto what vse or ende
thou were gotten, why thou were
made,Eccl. 12. of whose makynge thou
were made, to what thyng in this
worlde thou were fourmed: haue
mynde of thy makynge, be suche
as thou were made, yea suche as
thy maker formed the. Euery day
rensake thyn harte, euery day examyne
thyne harte: kepe thy soule
from synfulle thoughte, lette not
fowle thoughte ouerthrowe thy
mynde. When a shrewd thought
toucheth the, consent not to it.
            Kyll the serpent, when he fyrst appereth,
treade downe the serpentes

heed. Caste vnder foote the
begynnynge of yuell suggestion
or styrrynge to synne. Amende
synne there, where it is knowen.
In the begynnynge withstande
a shrewd thought, and thou shalt
escape well the remenant.
         
         
            ¶Ageynst Lechery.
            BE thou not defowled with any
vncleannesse,Gal. 5. be thou not
spotted through any foule luste:
Lette lecherye growe no more in
the, Chastitie ioyneth a man to
god. To chastitie is behyght the
kyngedome of heuen. If thou
yet fele the styrynge of thy fleshe,
if thou be touched with prickynges
of thy flesshe, if thou yet be
styred with the suggestion of lust,
if the mynde of lechery yet tyckle
thy wyll, if thy flesshe yet fyght
ageinst the, yf lechery yet tempteth

the, if luste yet styreth the to
synne: sette before the the mynde
of deathe, put before the, the day
of thy deathe, set before thyn eyen
the ende of thy life, put before the
the strayte dome that is to come,
put before the, the harde turmentes
that ben to come, sette before
the the euerlastynge fyre of Hell,
put before the the horrible peynes
of Helle.
         
         
            Busynes in Prayer.
            PRay with wepynge continually,The. 5.
pray busily, beseche god
daye and nyghte: Mourne and
sorowe euer for synne. Aryse in
the nighte to prayer, lette prayer
be to the a continuall armour.
            This is the fyrste vertue ageinste
temptation. Diuels ben ouercom
by prayer: Prayer auaylleth ageynst
all iuelles.
         
         
            
            Fastynge and Abstinence.
            CHastise thy body by fastynge,
by Abstynence, and by scarcenesse:
thou mayste not ouercome
temptations in their hyghe
heate, but if thou be lerned to
faste. Throughe meate forsothe
groweth luste, Plentie of meatis
stereth men to lechery: but by fastynge,
luste is restreyned, by fastynge
lechery is ouercome.
         
         
            Drynkynge.
            DRynke forsoth is instrument
of lechery. Fyre by castynge
to of wodde, increaseth more and
more, the more mattier is in the
fyre, the more is the flame.
         
         
            The syght.
            THyn eien ben the fyrst dartis
of luste. Sighte is desyre of
womanne, mynde is caughte by
the eien.Psal. 118. Withdrawe thyne eien

from wantonnes: set theym not
in the beautie of fleshe. Beholde
not a woman for to desyre her.
            Do away the cause of synnynge.Eccl. 25.
Laye besydes the, the mattier of
trespasynge. If thou wylte be
sure from lechery, be thou disceuered
from woman in bodye and
in syght.
         
         
            Felovvshyppe of vvomen.
            IF thou be departed in bodye
from women, thou shalte falle
from the intent of synne. If thou
sytte besydes a serpent, thou shalt
not longe be vnhurte. If thou be
longe afore a fyre, although thou
were made of iron, somtyme thou
shalt melte. If thou abyde ryght
nygh peryll, thou shalt not longe
be sekyr: oft tymes leysure hath
ouercome, whome wylle myghte
not.
         
         
            
            Traueyle.
            LEcherye ouertornethe sone a
man gyuen to idelnes. Luste
brenneth greuousely, whome she
fyndeth ydell. Lust gyueth place
to trauayle, to warke, to busynes,
and to labour. Therfore beware
of ydelnes, spende thy good in labour,
vse some maner of busines,
seke vnto the a profytable warke:
whervpon the intent of thy soule
may be sette.
         
         
            Redynge of holy Scripture.
            GIue the moche to redynge,
take hede in Meditation of
scripture, busye the in the lawe of
god, haue a customable vse in diuine
bokes. Redynge declareth
trewely, what thou shalte shone.
Redynge shewethe, what thou
oughtest to drede. Redynge telleth
whether thou goest. In redynge

wytte and vnderstandyng
increaseth. Thou shalte moche
profyte in redynge, yf thou doo
as thou redest.
         
         
            Mekenesse.
            BE thou meke, be thou groundid
in mekenesse, be thou leest
and lowest of all. By mekenesse
make thy selfe leaste. Set
thy selfe tofore no man. Auāt not
thy self, bost not thy selfe wantonly.
Streche not forth thy wynges
of pryde. So moche thou shalte
be the more precious afore god,
that thou settest lyttelle price by
thy selfe. Beare therfore shamefastenesse
in chere by myndynge
of thy defautes. For shame of thy
syn be dismayed to loke proudly.
Walke with a lowe chere, with a
meke mouth, and a sadde visage.
In hyghe worshyppe, haue great

mekenesse. Al thoughe thou be
hyghe of power, restreyne hyghnes
in thy selfe. Let not worship
make the prowde. The hygher
thou art in dignite, the lower by
mekenesse make thou the.
         
         
            Syckenesse and disease.
            BE not sory in thy diseases. In
thy syckenesse thanke thou
god. Be busye rather to be
hoole in thy soule, than inbodye.
If prosperitie come, be thou not
proude: if aduersite falle, be thou
nat heuy. Knowe thy selfe, that
god hath proued the in sorowe,
for thou shuldest not be prowde.
Be euen therfore in all thynges.
For ioye ne for sorowe, chaunge
neuer thy mynde. Understande
well, there is nothynge, but hit
may falle as god wyll. And if
those thynges be thought on before,

they ben the easier when they
fal. And what so euer therfore happeth,
suffer it mekely with fre wyl.
         
         
            Sufferaunce.
            BE more redy to suffre disease
than to do hit. Be patient,
be meke, be softe, be busye. Kepe
patience in all thynges: Kepe
softenesse: Kepe mekenesse. Set
before a sharpe worde, the shelde
of Sufferaunce. Thoughe any
man styre the to wrathe, though
he whet the, though he blame the,
though he repreue the, though he
chyde the, thoughe he do wronge
to the: be thou stylle, holde thy
peace, sette not therby, speake not
a worde, stryue not therageynst,
by sylence thou shalte the sooner
ouercome. Lerne at Christe manlynesse,
take hede at Christe, and
be not heuy: he suffrynge wronges

lefte to vs ensaumple,Mat. 26. he
was bobbed and buffetted,Luc. 22. spytte
vpon, and scorned, nayled hande
and foote, crowned with thornes,
dampned to the crosse, and
euer more helde his peace.
            Therfore what disease that falleth
to the, wytte it well, it commeth
to the for synne and for thy
best. And so tempre thy disease
by consideration of rightousnes.
And thou shalt suffre it the lyghtlyer,
if thou take hede, wherfore
it cometh.
         
         
            Loue peace.
            LOue peace without fourthe,
loue peace within forth, kepe
peace with all men, witholde all
men in myldenes, beclyppe Charitie.
Proue more thy selfe to loue
then to be loued. Make pece there
hate is. Haue stablenes of mynd.

Haue goodnes of wylle. Be redy
in good desyre.Eccl. 28. Speke gladly to
all men: Flee chydynge. Beware
of stryfes. Do away the occasion
of Stryfe, Despyse stryfe, and
lyue alwaye in peace, stryue not
in any wyse.
         
         
            Compassion.
            BE not glad vpon the death of
thyn ennemie,Eccl. 8. leste parauenture
vpō the fal the same, lest god
turne his wrath from hym to the.
For who so euer ioyeth in the fall
of his ennemie, he shal soone fall
in the same. Be glad to sorowe
vpon hym that is diseased. In
other mens miseases be not hard
harted: and for other mens mischeues
mourne as thyn owne.
         
         
            Folovvynge of goodnes.
            IN all thy busynesse, in all thy
warkes, in all thy lyuynge folowe

good men▪ folow holy men,
haue before thyn eien the ensample
of sayntis, take hede to worke
wel after the vertues of holy mē,
lerne to lyue well by the teachyng
of ryghtousnes.
         
         
            ¶Despisynge of praisynge.
            DEspise thou praysyng, cherishinge
and fauour of people.
Studie rather to be good
than to seme good. Take none
hede who prayseth the, or who disprayseth
the, leste praysynge deceyue
the, or blamynge lette the.
If thou sette naught by praising,
lyghtly thou shalte sette besydes
the blamynge. Therfore suppose
not thy selfe good, thoughe thou
beholde good in other mens tonges,
aske thyne owne conscience,
deme thy selfe by thin own dome,
and not bi other mens speche, but

in thyn owne mynde inserche thy
selfe. There may no man knowe
better what thou arte, then thou
that knowest thy selfe. What profyteth
the, sythen thou arte wycked▪
to be holde good?
         
         
            ¶Honest conuersation.
            FLe thou symulation, feine not
holynesse in darke clothynge.
Such as thou woldest ben holde,
suche be thou in dede. Shewe thy
profession in lyuynge and not in
tokens. In clothynge and in goinge
haue with the symplenesse:
in thy gate and in thy mouynge
clennes, in thy bearynge sadnes,
in thy walkyng honestie, nothing
of vilany, nothynge of vncleannesse,
nothynge of wyldenesse.
            Be ware in thy gouernance, that
there appere nothinge of beastlynes.
Gyue not to other cause for

to scorne the. Gyue thou not to
any man cause to backbite the.
         
         
            Good felovvshyppe.
            SHone yuel men,Nu. 16. beware of wicked
men, fle shrewes, dele not
with brothels: flee the companies
of those men, whiche ben euer redy
to vices. Ioyne the to good
men, Desyre the felowshyppe of
discrete men: Seke the company
of vertuous men. Who so goth
with wyse men, he shall be wise: &
who so draweth to fooles shall be
lyke to theym. For lyke to lyke is
woned to be ioyned.
         
         
            The herynge.
            SHutte thyne eares,Eccl. 28. that thou
here none yuell. Forsake vnchaste
speches. Fle vnhonest wordes.
For a vayne worde soone defouleth
the soule: and that that
is lyghte done, that is gladdelye

harde soone.
         
         
            The mouthe.
            LEt nothynge passe out of thy
mouthe, that myght let vertue.
Let the soune of thy voyce
breake forthe nothynge, but that
nedeth. Let that procede frome
thy lyppes, that fouleth not the
eares of the herers. Uayne worde
is token of a voyd cōscience. The
tonge of man sheweth his maners:
and suche as the worde is
suche is the soule.Mat. 12. For the mouth
speketh of abundance of the hart.Luc. 6.
Refreyne thy tonge frome yuelle
speache and ydell. For an ydell
worde shal not passe vnpunished.
Who soo wyll not refrayne his
tonge from ydell wordes, he shall
fall lyghtly into sinneful wordes.
Let thy word be without reprefe.
Let it be profitable to the helpe of

the herers. Besy the not to speke
yt that liketh, but that that nedeth.
Take hede what thou spekest, &
what thou spekeste not. And both
in speking & not speking be ryght
well ware, take good auisemente
what thou sayest: lest thou mayst
not call agayne, that thou saidest.
Fle thou the chaunces of tonge.
Let not thy tonge lese the. Haue
euer more silence to thy frende.
            Speke when time is, be stil whan
tyme is. Speke thou not ere thou
here. Lette askynge open thy
mouthe.
         
         
            ¶Agaynste the synne of
backebytynge.
            BAckebyte not the synner, but
be sory for hym. Kyt from thy
tonge the synne of backebytynge.
Here not an other mans life. Defoule
not thy mouthe with an other

mans syn. That thou backbiteste
in an other, drede hit in thy
self. Whan thou blamest an other,
repriue thyn owne syns. If thou
wylte backebyte, thynke on thyn
own sins. Loke not on other mens
defautes, but se thyn owne. Thou
shalt neuer backebyte, if thou wel
beholde thy selfe. Here no backebyters:
Lysten not to tale tellers.
For like gilty ben the backebiters
and the herers. Desire not to wyt
that that perteyneth not to the.
            That that men speake betwene
them selfe, besy the not to knowe.
Aske thou neuer what any man
speaketh, sayth, or doeth: be not
to besy, leaue besines that perteineth
not to the. By as great besynes
amende thyn owne synnes,
by howe moche thou beholdest other
mens.
         
         
            
            Of lyenge.
            FLe busylye all maner of lyenge,Eccl. 7.
and neyther by happe
nor by auysemente saye thou not
false. The mouth forsothe that lyethe,Sap. 1.
slethe the soule. Therfore
flee disceyte, Aduoyde lienge, beware
of falsenes, speke clenly, be
trewe of worde, Deceyue no man
in lyynge, ne brynge no man to
miswenynge. Speke not one
thynge and do an other. Saye
not one thynge and meane an
other.
         
         
            Of svvearynge.
            PUt fro the swerynge, Do away
the vse of swearynge.Iac. 5. It
is perillous sothely, for to swere.
For ofte swearynge maketh custome
of swearynge.Eccl. 23. And a man
moche swearynge, shalbe fulfylled
with wickednesse, & the plage

shall not departe from his house.
Trouthe nedethe none othe. A
feythfull speche holdeth the place
of a sacramente: as who sayth, a
faythfull worde is as moche as
all the swearynge of the worlde.
         
         
            A vovve made.
            DO the good that thou haste
behote.Deut. 23. Be not lyghte in
worde and harde in dede.Eccl. 5. Thou
shalte be moche gyltye to god,Baruc. 6. if
thou yelde not that thou haste avowed.
They displeasen god,
that fulfil not their vowes. They
bene accompted amonge hethen
menne, that performe not theyr
vowes, I saye not vowes that
bene yuell but good. For if thou
through thy foly hast made a fonned
vowe: throughe the dome of
a discrete man be hit wysely turned
into good.
         
         
            
            ¶To god all thynge is open.
            SEy not one yuell worde in thin
harte. An yuel worde may not
be hydde in silence, that thou doest
or sayest within thy selfe. Beleue
thou that hit is open before
god.Sap. 1. If men ben styll, bestes speken.
Therfore fly syn, as though
thou myghtest not kepe it priue.
Synne thou there, where thou
knowest god is not. There is no
thynge hyd from god, thou shalt
be founde gyltye in the iudgementis
of god, thoughe thou be
hydde to mannes iudgementes.
For he beholdethe the harte,Psal. 7.
that is within forthe.Rom. 8. He seeth &
knoweth,Apoc. 2. that man him self knoweth
not. Turne thy counsayle
and thy warke euermore to god.
In euery dede aske goddis helpe.
Arect al thinges to goddis grace,

and to goddes gyfte. Truste not
in thyn owne desertis: in thyn
owne vertue presume nothynge.
         
         
            Good conscience.
            THere maye no man fle frome
him self: and though an open
fame harme the not, yet thin own
conscience, damneth the. For ther
is no peyne greatter then pryckyng
of conscience. If thou wilte
neuer be sory, lyue well. A siker
cōscience suffreth easily heuines.
A good lyuer is euer more in ioy:
the cōscience of a sinful man is euer
more in peine. A gilty soule is
neuer more siker. Nother wound
nedeth shall feare the, if thou liue
well and trewely.
         
         
            Hyde vertue.
            IF thou wolt multiply thy vertues,
shewe them not. By thy
wyll, hyde thy vertues priuelye

for drede of pride and vayne glorie.
Fle to be seene, & then thou
deseruest mede. That thou maistlese
by shewynge, kepe it by hydynge.
         
         
            Confession.
            SHewe the synnes of thyn hart,
make opē thy shrewed thoughtes.
A syn shewed is sone healed: a
defaute forsoth hyd, is made more
syn, by silence it encreaseth more
and more. Trewely than hit behoueth
to shewe yuel to amend it.
         
         
            Fore thynkynge.
            BE thinke the longe before the
dede: Auise the longe before
the warke. That thou wylte do,
inserche it longe, proue it longe:
and so do it, when thou hast long
bethought the. Do than as thou
hast proued, in thynges that ben
certayne. Of wel doinge tary not,

ne put it not ouer tyll to morowe.
In good thynges taryenge harmeth,
& letteth tho thynges that
ben nedefull.
         
         
            VVisedome.
            THere is no thinge better than
wysedome, nothynge better
than cunnynge, nothynge lustier
thā knowlege: nothyng worse thā
lewdnesse. It is an hyghe counnynge
to knowe what thou shalt
flee: and it is an hyghe wretchednesse,
not to knowe whither thou
goeste. Therfore loue wisedome,
and it shalbe shewed to the: go to
it, and it shall come to the, be busy
there aboute, and it shal lerne the.
         
         
            Teachynge.
            LErne that thou canste not,
lest thou be founde an vnprofitable
techer, the good that thou
haste harde, sey it: the good that

thou hast lerned teache hit. The
more that is youē, the more it waxeth:
but yet let dedes go before the
worde. The whiche thou shewest
with thy mouth, fulfyll hit with
warke: that thou teachest by wordes,
shewe it in ensample. For if
thou teache and doo hit, thanne
shalte thou be holde glorious. In
thy techyng kepe the from mans
praysynge. So informe other,
that thou kepe thy selfe. Soo
teach, that thou lese not the grace
of mekenes. Beware, lest whyle
thou reysyste other by teachynge,
thou fal not thy selfe by praisyng.
When thou teachest, vse not darknes
of wordes: saye so that thou
be vnderstonden. The diuersitie
of persons is to be seen: And
whan and how thou teachest, be
aduised. Speake common thynges

to all men: And to fewe men
shewe that is hydde. Be not ashamed
to speake, that thou canste
well defende. That thou wantest
of cunnynge, aske of other men.
By cunnynge trewly shewed, hyd
thinges ben opened, & harde thinges
made lyght.
         
         
            Curiositie.
            BE not besy to knowe: that is
hydde, coueite not to knowe.
In disputynge do away stryfe: do
a waye frowardnes, and assente
soone to trouth. Say not ageynst
ryghtousenesse. Stryue not to
auoyde that is ryght. Loue more
to here than to saye. Here in the
begynnynge, and speake laste
of all: the last spech is better then
the fyrste.
         
         
            
            Obedience.
            VUorshyp euery man for the
merite of holynesse. After
theyr worthynes gyuen to euery
man worshyppe. Suppose not
thy selfe euen to thy soueraygne.
Gyue obeysance to thyn elders.
Serue theyr byddynges: bowe
to theyr auctoritie: folowe theyr
wyll. Obey to all men in good
byddynges: yet soo obey the to
man, that thou offende not the
wyll of god. Therfore fulfylle
mekely the charges yt thou hast
take vppon the, be obediente to
goddes ordinaunce: be not hardy
to do ageynst his wyll. Dispose
all thynges not with a sturdy but
with an easye harte. Beware
of worshyppes, whiche thou
mayste not haue withoute synne.
         
         
            
            Souerayntie.
            BUsy the rather to be loued of
thy subiectes then to be drad.
Let thy subiectes rather worshyp
and serue the for loue, than for
drede or for nede. Quite the such
to thi subiectis, that thou be more
loued than dradde. With a soueraygne
goodnes gouerne thy subiectes.
Be not ferdful to thy subiectes:
be such lorde to them, that
they be glad to serue the. Both in
punyshynge an cheryshyng, kepe
a meane: be not to strayte, ne forgyue
not to soone. Kepe maner in
al thy warke. It longeth to a wise
man to measure all thynges, lest
of good be made yuell. Beholde
certaynely, what is couenable for
the tyme, where, when, how, and
wherfore thou byddest any thyng
to be done. That thou wolt to be

done to the, do thou to an other.
Be suche to other men, as thou
desirest other men to be to the.
Hynder no man with thy witnes.
Do no man harme, leste thou suffer
the same. Kepe manlines, kepe
ryghtousnes, defende no man agaynste
trouth. When thou demest,
be he poore, be he ryche, beholde
the cause & not the persone.
Kepe trouthe in all thynges. Syt
neuer in dome without mercy. Be
as meke in other mens defautes
as in thyn owne. So deme other
men, as thou desirest to be demed
thy selfe. While thou arte merciciful
in other mens gilt, thou hast
mercy on thy selfe. The dome that
thou puttest vpon an other, thou
shalt beare thy selfe.Mat. 7. In what mesure
that thou measureste,Mar. 4. shalbe
measured to the. Deme no man

by suspection: fyrste proue and so
deme. In domes reserue the sentence
to goddes iudgement. And
that that thou knoweste, to thyn
owne dome: and that that thou
knowest not, to goddes dome.
         
         
            Despite of the vvorlde.
            IF thou wolte be in reste, desire
nothynge of the worlde. Thou
shalte haue rest of soule, if thou
put fro the ye busines of ye worlde.
Cast fro ye al that may let a good
purpose, be mesured to the world,
and the worlde to the, as thoughe
thou were dead. Beholde not the
glory of this worlde. Set not by
that whyle thou lyuest, that thou
mayste not haue when thou arte
dead. What so euer thou gyuest,
gyue it with a good wyl. Do mercy
withoute gyfte: gyue almes
without heuynes. The good wil

is more than that is gyuen. That
yt is giuen with good wyll,Eccl. 3
                     •
                  . yt god
acceptethe:2. Cor. 9. but he that gyueth
with heuynes, shall lese his
mede. There is no mercye,
where is no good
wyll. Do nothynge
for praysynge,
nothynge
for
worldely opiniō, but
onely for life euer
lasting.
Amen.
