            ¶ To the ryght honorable ye lord Herbert of Cardiffe, Maiſter Edwarde Herbert, and Maſter Henry Compton, his brethren.
            
               REdyng ſomtymes theſe Dialoges of Gelli (right honourable, and my ſinguler good lorde and mayſters) and fynding them not onelye thought worthy trāſlation into other languages, but alſo dedication to kynges, and Princes, I fell lykewyſe together with the inſtigation of dyuers my frendes, in ſuche deſyre to ſee the ſame in oure toungue, that others haue brought to paſſe in theirs: the whiche hanynge nowe finiſhed, as I haue beſt bene able, and conſidering how goodly a glaſſe it may be to them that knowe none other language then their owne, to ſee herein howe lyke the brute beaſt, and farre from his perfection man is, without the vnderſtanding and folowinge of dyuyne thynges: And what his perfecte beinge is, hauynge

that, and maye thereby ſet aparte, and leaue thoſe baſe and ſenſual appetites led with mordinate wyll, takynge a free courſe guyded by reaſonne, by the meane of the vnderſtandinge: and threewithall remembryng aſwell my bounden duetie, both for benefite receaued by the goodnes of your ryghte honorable father, and the moſt gentle affection (I perſwade my ſelf your ſelues bear towardes me) as alſo the proſe of the vndoubted towardnes vnto al vertues and knowledge, the myghty maker of all hath put into you, in this tyme of your tender ages, as an aſſured hopo of your moſt nyghe comminge to very true perfection: I haue thought it my part, as one deſyrous rather indedes then wordes to ſhewe myne aſſured ſeruice towardes you, euen as I haue of longe time heretofore ſerued in your educatiō, in one equall ſorte, ſo likewiſe to unpart vnto you theſe my ſmall trauelles: though not aunſwerable to your honoure and merites, yet of the beſt of my lytle power, and ſomewhat apte for your conference in the Italion or other tounges, the whiche alreadye you

well taſte and ſauour of. Mooſte humbly
                  •
               , therefore beſechyng, it may pleaſe you, to accept this my meane traduction, not ſo muche for the qualitie of the gifte, as for the great deſyre I haue to ſhewe, not onely my labours and pains bound vnto you, but my life alſo as it may ſtand in ſtede: The eternal God preſerue you, with much encreaſe of honor.
            
               From London, the .xv. day of March.

            ¶ To the moſte myghtie and excellent Prince Coſimo de Medici, Duke of Florence.
            
               AMong al thinges that are in the vniuerſall worlde, moſte vertuous and gentle prynce, it ſemeth that man onely can choſe of him ſelfe, a ſtate and ende after his owne mynde, and walkynge in that pathe, that moſt pleaſeth him, canne rather rule his lyfe freely accordinge to tharbitremente of his owne will, then to thinclination of nature. For if ye nature of thinges be diligently conſidered, to all the ſpecial kinds of them, there haue bene appointed and wyth an inuyolable lawe aſſigned, by him who is cauſe of all, certeine boundes, out of the whiche they canne by no poſſible meanes paſſe, chaunging into better or worſe ſort, that beinge, that at the beginning was graunted them. Whereas in the power of man there hath bene frely put an abilitie to choſe a way wherin he mought lede his lyfe moſte at his owne pleaſure. Ind almoſt like a newe Prometheus, to trāſforme him ſelfe into what he moſt willed, takynge lyke a Cameleont the colour of al thoſe thinges vnto the whiche with thaffecte he is moſt nygh

And contrary when they wythdrawe them the moſt they may from thence, and retourne to ther owne true and proper operation, and lifting them ſelues from things baſe and earthly, to things high and diuine, are broughte to their owne trewe perfection, like vnto thoſe happie ſpirites, who out of this corruptible world, liue in contemplation of diuine thinges, their life is moſt happy and bleſſed.

And for that like as men are naturally bounde to geue honor to God, not onely with their minde and wordes, but alſo wyth ſome outward ſigne, offeringe him of the moſt dere and precious thynges they haue, they alſo oughte in that ſorte they beſte knowe and can, to honour alwaies their Princes, becauſe they are (as the ſame Plutarche ſaide) the very and true Images of god, for that they kepe the ſame degree in their ſtates, that the moſt hygh and myghtie God holdeth in the vniuerſall. I bothe by nature and election ſeruaunt of your highnes, knoinge howe muche aſwell naturally, as by benefites receiued, I am bounde alwaies to honour ye ſame,

and not being able to do it in ſuch ſort as I gladlye would, deſiring at the leſt to ſhewe the redines of my good will, haue taken corage to preſente the ſame with theſe, ſuch as they are, my ſmal trauails, humbly praying your highnes, that like as god him ſelfe, as greate as he is, neuer deſpiſeth anye gyfte, thoughe mooſte ſmalle and of litle valewe, offered him of a pure and ſincere minde, the ſame now like wiſe will not ſet light this my moſt litle gift, ſins although it be of the beſt and moſt dere thinges I haue, it maye ſeme in very deede, to ſmal and poore, in reſpect of your highnes and deſertes of the ſame. I beſeche then finally your excellencye, that recompenſinge euery lacke with the goodnes of my will, you will gentellye receiue the ſame. Sins I deſire nothing more, then as my duetye is (beinge your mooſt faithfull and obedient ſeruaunt) alwaies to ſerue and honoure your highnes. From Florence the firſt of Marche. 1548.

            The Argument
            
               VLiſſes after the wars of Troye, retourninge into Gretia his coūtry, and being by contrary windes to his nauigation, driuen to diuerſe and ſundry countryes, arryued at the laſte in the Iſlande of Circes. Where he was by her moſt gently receyued, and there for many curteſies that ſhe ſhewed hym, taried a certaine tyme, and ſo deſyrous to ſ
                  •
                his countrye agayne he aſketh her licence to departe, and alſo that ſhe would cauſe all thoſe Gretians, to become men agayne, whom ſhe hadde tranſfourmed into dyuers beaſtes, and were then there, that he myght lede them againe into their owne countries.
            Circes graunteth him this fauor, but yet with theſe conditions, that onelye they that would ſhould obteine this thynge of hym, and thothers ſhoulde remayne, to ende theyr lyues there ſo in bodies of beaſtes. And becauſe he myghte knowe this thing of them, ſhe graūteth, to euery one of them the power to ſpeake, euen as he

could when he was man. Vliſſes ſeketh through al the Iland and ſpeaketh with many, who for diuers occaſions wil rather remaine in that life, then to become men agayne. Finally finding one, who conſidering wel the mightines of man, and howe farre he is more noble then anye other beaſt, by meane of thunderſtanding deſireth to become man agayn as he was. And ſo being reſtored by Vliſſes, into his former beyng, firſt (as it is the duetie of man) hauing acknowledged and geuen thanckes vnto the mooſt highe and mightie God of all, they retourned merelye together into their countrye.
         
         
            
            The fyrſte Dyaloge. Vlyſſes and Circes, Oiſter and Moule.
            
               ALthoughe the loue that thou bereſt vnto me moſt famous Circes, & thinfinite curteſis yt at all tymes I fynd in the, are occaſions, that I ſhould wyllinglye remayne with thee in this thy fayre and pleaſaunt Iſlande: Yet the loue of my country, and the deſyre, (after ſoo long wandring) to ſee my moſt dere frendes, ſtirre me continually to depart from the, and to retourne to mine owne houſe. But before my departure, I would gladly knowe yf amonge thoſe, whome thou haſt tranſfourmed into Lyons, Wolues, Beares, and other beaſtes, there be anye Gretian?
            
               Cir.
               Yea there are manye my moſt dere Vliſſes: But why doeſte thou aſke me thys?
            
            
               Vli.
               Lette vs ſytte downe here on this rocke, where both the ſyghte

of the dyuers waues of the ſea, and the pleaſauntneſſe of the ſweete wyndes, that paſſe through theſe ſauerye plantes, ſwetelye blowyng, ſhall make oure talke muche more delectable, and I wyll tell it thee.
            
            
               Cir.
               Let vs doo what thou wylte Vliſſes, for I deſyre none other thynge then to pleaſe the

                  .
            
            
               Vli.
               The cauſe whye I haue aſked thee mooſte faire Circes, yf amongeſt thoſe whom thou haſte tranſfourmed into beaſtes, there be anye Gretian, is for that I would deſyre to obtaine by my requeſte at thy hande, that they myghte be reſtored vnto their humayne beynge, and I lede them agayne with me into their owne countrey.
            
            
               Cir.
               And why deſyreſt thou this?
            
            
               Vli.
               For the loue I beare vnto them, and for that wee are of one countrye, hopyng thereby to be amongeſt my Gretians muche prayſed. Whereas by the contrarye, being knowen that I were able to gette them oute of ſo miſerable an vnhappy ſtate, haue ſuffered them ſo wretchedlye to lede their lyfe in bodies of beaſtes, I thinke it woulde be vnto me no ſmall blame.
            
            
               
               Cir.
               And yf others, as thou thinkeſt Vliſſes would prayſe thee for the ſame: Yet they therfore wold beare the ſo great hatred for ye hurte thou ſhouldeſt do them, that thou wouldeſt repente the thereof a thouſande tymes a daye.
            
            
               Vli.
               Is it harme then to cauſe one to retourne from a beaſte to a man?
            
            
               Cir.
               Ye moſt harme. And to trye the trueth, aſke of theym, for I wyll not graunte thee this fauour, except they alſo be contented therewith.
            
            
               Vli.
               Howe maye I knowe this of them, who beinge Beaſtes, vnderſtande not? nor yet canne ſpeake? I doubt that thou mocke me.
            
            
               Cir.
               Chaunge not thy mynd, for I ſhall graunte theym ſpeache.
            
            
               Vli.
               And ſhall they haue the ſelf ſame diſcourſe that they had when they were men?
            
            
               Cir.
               Yea for lyke as I chaunged them into beaſtes ſo ſhall I cauſe the knowledge of very mē to come into them againe. And for to loſe nomore time: ſeeſt thou thoſe two ſhelles faſtned to yonder ſtone, that open & ſhette agayne, and that hillocke of earth a little withoute the water, at the foote of that Palme tree?
            
            
               Vli.
               Yea I ſee theim well.
            
            
               Cir.
               In thone is an Oyſter, and in thother

a Mowle, who heretofore were men, and Gretians, thou ſhalte ſpeake wyth them. And bycauſe thou maieſt more frely do it, I will gette me hence ſportinge me on this ſtrond. And when thou haſt perceyued their myndes, come to me and I ſhall doo as thou thy ſelfe wilte.
            
            
               Vli.
               Truely this is a greate matter that Cyrces hath tolde me, that theſe beinge thus in bodies of beaſtes, ſhalbe able, (and by her meanes) to diſcourſe and reaſonne with me. And it ſemeth to me ſo incredyble that I dare not almoſt proue it, fering that yf it came not to paſſe, I ſhould (as reaſon is) be accompted a foole. But here is none beſides her that canne blame me therefore: And yet canne not ſhe reaſonably do it, for that ſhe her ſelf hath counſailed me therunto, and therefore I will not fayle to proue. But howe muſt I call thē? I of my ſelfe can not tell howe, but by the name that they haue beinge thus beaſtes? Let me ſo do then. Oiſter, O Oyſter.
            
            
               Oiſt.
               What wilt thou with me Vliſſes.
            
            
               Vli.
               I alſo woulde call thee by thy name yf I knewe it. But if thou be a Gretian

as Cyrces hath tolde me, it may pleaſe thee to tell it me.
            
            
               Oist.
               A Gretian I was, before I was chaunged into an Oyſter, and I was of a place beſyde Athens, and my name was Itacus: and becauſe I was but poore I became a Fyſher.
            
            
               Vli.
               Then reioyce. For the pitie that I haue of the, knowing that thou wer borne man, and the loue that I bere the, for that thou arte of my countrey, haue cauſed me to praye Cyrces to reſtore the into thy former ſhape, and that I afterwardes may leade thee agayne with me into Gretia.
            
            
               Oist.
               Folowe that no farther Vliſſes, for this thy wiſdome and eloquence, for the which thou art ſo much prayſed amongeſt thy Grecians, haue no force at al with me: So that go not about to counſell me with thone, that I leaue ſo many commodities, ye which I now in this ſtate ſo happely enioye without any thought at al, nor to perſwade me with thother that I ſhoulde retourne man, ſynce he is the moſt vnhappye creature, that is in all the worlde.
            
            
               Vli.
               Oh my Itacus, when thou loſte the ſhape of man, it ſhould ſeme thou loſt reaſon

alſo to ſaye thus.
            
            
               Oyſt.
               Thou canſt not leaſe it. Vliſſes thou, becauſe thou haſte it not, yf thou beleue as thou ſayeſt. But let vs ſet iniuries a parte, and let vs reaſon frendly a little togethers, and thou ſhalte ſee yf I that haue proued thone life and thother, can ſhewe thee that, that is trewe that I ſaye.
            
            
               Vli.
               Truely thys woulde I gladdely ſee.
            
            
               Oyſt.
               Then harken vnto me: But heareſt thou? I will that thou promiſe me that while I open (as thou ſeeſt) to ſpeak, thou wilte watche, that ſome of theſe traiterous reabbes, come not and caſt a little ſtone betwene my two ſhelles, wherby I could not afterward ſhet my ſelfe againe.
            
            
               Vli.
               And whye ſo?
            
            
               Oyſt.
               To drawe me afterward forth with his clawes, and to fede him ſelf of me, for thus they are wōt to do when they finde vs open.
            
            
               Vli.
               Seo a ſubtill crafte. And who hath taughte you to beware of them, and ſo to fly theſe their deceyptes?
            
            
               Oyſt.
               Nature, that neuer fayleth to any thynge, of that, that is neceſſarye.
            
            
               Vly.
               Be wythoute feare, and ſpeake ſafely, for I wyll watche.
            
            
               
               Oyſt.
               Go to then, harken vnto me. Tell me a litle Vliſſes: you menne that glorye your ſelues ſo much, to be more parfitte, and more wiſe then we, for that you haue the diſcourſe of reaſon: do not you eſteme thoſe thinges more, the whiche you iudge to be better then thother?
            
            
               Vli.
               Yea verely, and this rather is one of the chiefe ſygnes wherby our perfection and wiſedome may be knowen. Foraſmuche as the eſteming of euerye thinge alike, commeth of the litle knowing of their nature and goodnes, and is a manifeſt token of folyſhenes.
            
            
               Oyſt.
               And do not you loue them better then thother of leſſe eſtimation?
            
            
               Vlis.
               Ye, bycauſe euer by the knowledge: eyther loue or hatred foloweth.
               For all thoſe thinges that appeare good vnto vs, are beloued and deſyred, and contrarye thoſe that ſeme noughte to vs, are hated and eſchewed.
            
            
               Oyſt.
               And louynge them more then the reſt, haue you not alſo greater care of theym?
            
            
               Vli.
               Who dowteth therof?
            
            
               Oyſt.
               Thinkeſt not thou that nature alſo doeth the ſelfe ſame, or that intelligence that guideth her? and

with much more reaſon then you, becauſe ſhe can not erre, as oftenne times I haue harde ſaye of thoſe Philoſophers of Athenes, whiles I, to ſell the fiſhe that I toke, ſtode by the gallaries, where they a great parte of the daye, diſputed and reaſoned together.
            
            
               Vli.
               This thinke I alſo.
            
            
               Oyst.
               Yf thou graunt me this, thou haſt graunted me alſo that we are better and more noble then you.
            
            
               Vli.
               And by what meanes?
            
            
               Oyſt.
               Becauſe Nature makynge more accompte of vs, then ſhe hath done of you, it foloweth yt ſhe loueth vs better. And louing vs better ſhe doth it for none other cauſe then for that, that I haue told thee
            
            
               Vli.
               What, me thinketh thou arte the beſt Logitian of Athenes.
            
            
               Oyſt.
               I knowe not what Logique meaneth, cōſider howe I may be a Logitian, I ſpeake in ſuch ſort as nature hath taught me. And this reaſon myght euery one make, that hath the diſcourſe of reaſon, and it is moſte true.
            
            
               Vli.
               Yea yf it were true that Nature ſette more by you, then ſhe doeth by vs.
            
            
               Oiſt.
               This is eaſie to proue, and yf thou wilte that I ſhew it thee, harken

vnto me, and becauſe thou ſhalt perceaue the better, I will that we beginne from the fyrſt day that ſhe bringeth forthe both you and vs into the world, the which is the daye of our birth. Where, tell me I pray thee, what care hath ſhe ſhewed to haue of you, ſyns ſhe cauſeth you to be borne naked? wher contrary ſhe hath ſhewed to eſteme vs muche, cauſing vs to come into the world clothed, ſome with lether, ſome with heare, ſome with ſcales, ſome with one thing, and ſome with an other, the which is a manifeſt token that ſhe hath greatly in her harte mynded our conſeruation.
            
            
               Vli.
               This reaſon maketh not for thee, for though ſhe hath made vs naked, and couered vs with ſo thinne a ſkinne, that we are hurte by euery lytle thing, ſhe 
                     ••
                  th done it, for that we hauing to exerciſethe fantaſie, and other our inner ſenſes, farre more diligently then you, to ſerue afterwardes the vnderſtanding: it was conueniente that our members, and perticulerly thoſe orgaines, and thoſe inſtrumentes, wher thoſe operations are made, ſhuld be of a more gentle, and more

lyghte matter, and ſo alſo more ſubtill bloud, & more hote then youres are, wherby the wekenes of our complexion groweth. For if we wer made of thoſe euyll humors, and thoſe groſſe bluddes, that ye are (wherby it foloweth that you ar more ſtrong, and of more luſty complexion thē we, but yet not of longer life, for this cō
                  meth of the temperature of ye complexion in which thing we paſſe you very muche, & therfore we haue the perceueraunce of touchinge muche more perfyt then you, for it perceyueth euery moſte little difference) it ſhould folowe that we ſhould be of lytle knowledge, and of litle witte as you are. For as theſe Phiſnomiers ſaye, the cuſtomes of the mind folow the complexions of the body: whereby it is euer ſene, that to the members of a Lion, the conditions of a Lion, and to the members of a Beare the conditions of a Beare folowe. And that this is trewe, marke well amonge men, and thou ſhalt ſee, that they who are made of groſſe humours, are alſo groſſe of witte, and contrarie, they that are of thinne and quicke fleſhe, are lykewyſe

quicke of witte, ſo that nature willyng to make vs reaſonable & of moſt perfit knowledge, was in maner enforced to make vs ſo.
            
            
               Oiſt.
               Enforced, no I will not beleue this yet, becauſe ſhe making all thinges, mought haue made them as ſhe had liſted, and mought very wel haue kepte an other rule, and an other order in them. And for an example, to make that water of it ſelf, ſhould heate, & fyre ſhould refreſhe.
            
            
               Vli.
               Ye but this wonderfull order the which is among all creatures and from whence eche one confeſſeth his bewtie to come, could not by this meanes haue bene in the whole world.
            
            
               Oist.
               No ther ſhuld haue bene an other frō whence an other maner of beuty ſhuld haue proceded, peraduenture farre fairer thē this.
            
            
               Vli.
               Whiles we are vpon peraduenture we walke as out of the way. But what matter maketh it thoughe nature hath made vs naked, ſince ſhe hath geuen vs ſuch knowledge and ſtrēgth, that we can couer vs with your clothes?
            
            
               Oiſt.
               Ye but with what danger how many of you haue come to miſchiefe, by your myndinge to

take vs to ſerue your ſelues of oures? And beſydes this with howe great labour? For if you wil be ſerued with oure ſkinnes, you muſt dreſſe them, our heare you muſt ſpinne them, weue theym, and do a thouſand other thinges vnto them, before you bring them into ſuch frame, that you may ſerue youre ſelues of them.
            
            
               Vli.
               Theſe laboures are ſwete and pleaſaunte vnto vs. Ye they are rather a paſtime to vs thē otherwyſe.
            
            
               Oist.
               Ye, to them that do it for paſtyme, as thou ſometimes doeſt, but aſke a litle of thoſe, who do it enforced by neceſſitie, and to ſcratche out by their laboures, ſo muche as may ſerue theyr very nede, and thou ſhalt ſee yf they will ſaye, that theſe paines ſeme pleaſaunte to them or no. I for myne owne parte knowe that whiles I was a mā, it greued me ſo much to labour, that as I haue told the) I made my ſelfe a fyſſher, and I would haue willyngly put my ſelfe to any more heinous occupation, ſo that I mought not haue labored, eſteminge it to be an arte of oxen, who alwaies laboure, and when they can no more, are then knocked on the hed with

a betell.
            
            
               Vli.
               Yf thou madeſt thee a fyſher becauſe thou wouldeſt not labour, it ſhould chaunce to the as it doth to al thoſe that flye paynes. Thou thinkeſt it ſhould rounne after thee, for thou tookeſt an arte in hande, wherin not doing it for pleaſure, there is more paines then in any other. And beſides this, there is infinite troubles of windes, of cold, of hete of the ſonne abidden, and of many other things.
            
            
               Oiſt.
               And thou ſeeſt well, that I will no more become man againe, and I thinke I haue reaſon, conſideringe beſides this that nature hath ſet litle ſtore by you, for beſides the bringing forth of you naked, ſhe alſo hath not made you any houſe or habitation, of your own, wher you mought defend you from thiniuries of the wether as ſhe hath made to vs, yt which is a plaine token, that you are as rebelles and baniſhed of this world, hauing no place here of your owne.
            
            
               Vli.
               What houſes hath ſhe made to you?
            
            
               Ois.
               What houſes: Conſider mine a litle of theſe two ſhelles, with what great arte and commoditie ſhe hath builte it for me: ſee howe I open and

ſhytte caſely as I haue nede to fede me, or to repoſe me, and to defend me from ſuch as wold hurt me. Conſider alſo what ſhe hath done for the Tortoflees, and for the Snayles, and howe eaſely they carye their houſes with them.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what houſes hath ſhe made to the other beaſtes, beinge the more parte, and alſo to the birdes?
            
            
               Oyſt.
               For the winter the holes and the dennes of the earth, and for the ſommer, the trees and hyll toppes.
            
            
               Vli.
               Oh, fayre houſes, I thinke they be there in dede in very great eaſe.
            
            
               Oyst.
               Yf there be not ſo many commodities ther, as are in yours, nether are there ſo many diſpleaſures and thoughts.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what diſpleaſures and thoughtes haue we of oures that make theim after our owne mindes with our own handes?
            
            
               Oist.
               What diſpleaſures and thoughtes: the maynteyninge of them, the reparing of them, and the defending thē from thincōmodities that time bringeth with him? beſydes this, when reſteth any of you one hower in them with a quiet mynd, being neuer aſſured that they fall not on your backe, and more then that, the feare of the

earthquakes, the whiche I remember, cō
                  myng heretofore in our countrie, the people feared in ſuche ſorte, that the nyghtes they taried in the fieldes, and the dayes they went togethers on flockes lyke cranes, praying and crying to the goddes, & bearing about certeine their olde harnes, with fyrebrandes a lyght in their handes, whereby it was plainelye knowen, that feare cā do ſo much in you, that it cauſeth you very often tymes to loſe your wittes.
            
            
               Vli.
               Theſe are thinges that chaunce ſo ſeldome, that there is no hede to be taken thereof.
            
            
               Oist.
               Beſydes this you canne not buylde you other houſes in euery place as nature hath done to vs, or in ſuch ſort that you may cary theym after you, as manye of vs maye.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what hurte is thys, when we haue one after our own minde? knoweſt thou not that he yt is well ſhould not chaunge?
            
            
               Oist.
               What hurt: yf euyll chaunce be that you haue ſome neighbour who either by his conditions, or by ſome ſcience that he hath, is by anye meanes, trobleſome vnto you, & againſt your mind what infelicitie is the not beinge able to go any other where as we do? So that retourning

to our fyrſt talke, Nature hauing vs in much more eſtimation, then you, as I haue ſhewed thee, & ſhe not able to fayle, it followeth that we are better & farre more noble then you.
            
            
               Vli.
               This thy reaſon is onely a litle apparaunte, for although it ſeme that nature hath geuen you many mo commodities, then ſhe hath to vs, ſhe hath done it, for that ſhe knew you were not able of your ſelues, to procure them vnto you. But here what I ſhall ſaye vnto thee, and thou ſhalt ſee which of vs is more noble. Tel me I pray thee: whether is the maiſter or the ſeruant more noble?
            
            
               Oyſt.
               The maiſter I think as maiſter.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou thinkeſt well, and ſo alſo among all thinges, the thing is more noble the which is ende of others, then thoſe thinges which are ordeyned to mainteyne or to ſerue it. Wherof it alſo foloweth, that we being as your endes, muſt be more noble then you. And that we be your endes, and that all you were created by nature, to ſerue vs, experience ſheweth it playnely, ſins we ſerue our ſelues of you whiles you liue, to bere

oure thinges from one place to another, to laboure the earthe, and to a thouſande other exerciſes, and after when you are dede, to clothe vs of your ſkinnes, and to fede vs of your fleſhe. Now ſee then whether you were made by nature for vs or no.
            
            
               Oist.
               Yf theſe reaſons were true you ſhould haue bene alſo made by her for the erth, for at ye laſt ſhe eateth you al. And ſo ſhoulde you alſo be leſſe noble then the earthe, ſhe being your ende.
            
            
               Vli.
               This conſequence is nothing woorth, and becauſe thou ſhalt vnderſtand it the better, thou ſhalt note ther are two ſortes of endes.
            
            
               Oist.
               Uliſſes, I wyll not that thou trouble thy ſelfe any more, for thou begynneſt to enter into thoſe diſputatiōs with me, that I heretofore haue hearde in the galleries of Athens of thoſe Philoſofers, whiles I, (as I tolde thee before) wēt about to ſell thoſe fewe fiſſhes that I had taken, to prouyde me of ſuche other neceſſaries as I hadde neede of: the whyche (I thinke) neyther they nor others knewe.
               But I fele that the dewe beginneth to fall, whereof I fede, opening me as thou

ſeeſt, wherin I haue ſo great delight, and without any trouble or thoughte at all, that whyleſt I was man, I neuer proued the like. So that maruell no more that I wyll remayne thus. And yf thou vnderſtandeſt it otherwiſe, then be thou ſoo, and trouble me no more, for after that I haue fedd, I wil ſhet me again, and take ſome reſte, and without any mooſte lytle thought at all, the which very ſeldome chaunſeth to you. And I eſteme more this my contentation then al yt euer I mought hope to haue at thy handes.
            
            
               Vli.
               Truly I coulde ſcarſely haue chaunced worſe: for it ſhould ſeme, that this felowe was of very litle diſcourſe in the world, and the arte that he did, declareth it. For all they that attent to fyſhe or to foule, (I ſpeake of them that do it for nede, and not for pleſure) are vyle perſons, and of litle knowledge. And marke alſo how litle knowledge he ſhould haue of the pleaſures of the world, ſyns he would barter theym for a lytle dewe that he now taſteth being thus an Oyſter. Well, let me then thus leue him in this his miſerie, a moſt iuſte

rewarde of his follie. And let me proue to reaſon a lytle with this Moule, yt Circes told me was in yonder Hillocke of earth, for I ſhall perchance happen on a man of more knowledge, I will gette me a litle nere her, and call her. Moule, O Moule.
            
            
               Mo.
               What wilt thou with me Vliſſes? and what moueth the thus to trouble my quietnes?
            
            
               Vli.
               If thou kneweſt what I had obteyned of Circes (by my requeſt, for thy profitte) thou wouldeſt not ſaye that I wer trobleſom to the, if thou haue the vſe of reaſon lyke a man.
            
            
               Mo.
               As though I harde it not euen nowe of thee, whileſt thou ſpakeſt with this other Gretian, whom ſhe tranſfourmed into an Oyſter.
            
            
               Vli.
               And that I may cauſe thee to retourne man, and deliuer the from this place and to leade thee agayne with me, into thy countrye, ſo that thou be a Gretian as ſhe tolde me.
            
            
               Mo.
               A Gretian I was whiles I was man, and of the fayreſt part of all Etolia.
            
            
               Vli.
               And deſyreſt not thou to be reſtored into thy fyrſte ſhape, I meane when thou were a man,

and to retourne vnto thyne owne houſe.
            
            
               Mo.
               This is not my deſyre, for thē wer I a fole.
            
            
               Vli
               Is it folyſhnes then to deſyre a better ſtate?
            
            
               Mo.
               No. But to ſeke to make it worſe, as I ſhould do to be come man agayne. Bycauſe now I liue with moſt gret pleaſure in this ſtate, & in this kynd, where as beyng man, I ſhould not ſo do, but I ſhould lyue in continual troubles, and paynes importunate, wherof humaine nature is moſt aboundaunte.
            
            
               Vli.
               And who hath taught thee this ſo goodly matter? This ignoraunte fiſher with whom I ſpake euen now?
            
            
               Mo.
               Euen experience, maiſtres of all thinges, hath taught it me, by the meanes of the occupation that I had.
            
            
               Vli.
               And in what ſort hath experience ſhewed thee that we are more vnhappy, and more miſerable then you?
            
            
               Mo.
               I will tell thee one onely experience, the which (as I haue told thee) I knew playnely by the meanes of mine exerciſe, of the which, thou afterwardes mayſt of thy ſelf pycke out many others, that ſhalbe of no leſſe weight then this.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what was the arte that thou

dyddeſt exercyſe, that made thee to know ſo falſe a thinge? Tell on.
            
            
               Mo.
               To tyll the grounde.
            
            
               Vli.
               I may wel ſay now I am a fote, to get out of the handes of a fiſher, and to come into the handes of a plowman, who if he ſwarue not from his nature, ſhalbe much leſſe able to vnderſtande reaſon then the other.
            
            
               Mo.
               Doe me none iniury Vliſſes wyth wordes, for euery man is a man, and rather take hede to that that I ſaye, for yf thou ſhalte well conſyder it, thou wilt perchaunce repent, that Circes hath not changed the alſo into ſome beaſte, as ſhe hath done vs.
            
            
               Vli.
               Go to then, ſay on, for truely I deſyre nothinge more.
            
            
               Mo.
               What beaſt findeſt thou in all the worlde, eyther of the water or of the earth, the kindes of whome are almoſte infinite, to whome the earth of it ſelfe bringeth not foorth for him, wherewith to fede him, except to man? who, yf he will that ſhe bring him forth his foode, as to others, muſt laboure it, & with great paynes ſow it with his handes.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thys errour commeth of him ſelfe, who wil be nouryſhed with ouer delicate meates.

But yf he woulde lyue of the fruyte that ſhe of her ſelfe bringeth foorth, as other beaſtes do, this ſhould not chaunce vnto him.

               And what graſſe, what ſede and what fruites, bringeth ſhee of her ſelfe forth, not beinge holpen by arte, that are meete nor

                  ſhmente and conueniente for the conſeruation of the lyfe of man, & for the mayntenaunce of the temperature of his complexion.
            
            
               Vli.
               Is it not ſayde that thoſe fyrſte auneyente people, of thage that was called the golden age, dydde liue ſo?
            
            
               Mo.
               O Vlyſſes, thou makeſt profeſſion of a wyſe man, and yet beleueſt thou theſe tales?
            
            
               Vli.
               Wel, when that alſo that thou ſayeſt wer true, yet this laboure that man endureth to laboure and tyll the grounde, to water and keepe the vynes, and to plante fruytes, doth it not brynge there with ſo greate delyte and pleaſure, that it may be ſayd, that nature hath geuen it to man, for his paſtime, and for that he ſhould not liue in Idlenes, and after for his welth and profyt? And that this is true, marke what large rewarde of fruyte ſhe geueth after warde for his

paynes? Wherby it ſemeth that nothinge is more ſwete then huſbandrye. And beſydes this ſhe hath done it, for that manne ſhould haue wherwith to ſhewe his wit, and cunninge, and howe he is worthier then the other beaſtes are.
            
            
               Mo.
               Naye rather becauſe ſhe ſhould neuer take reſt, nor neuer haue one good howre. And beſydes this to trouble him more, the feare of death is ioyned to him in ſuch ſorte that when the earth throughe contrarye wethers, bringeth not foorth ſo largelye her frutes, one yeare as ſhe was wont, he all that time liueth in daunger and feare, that he be not enforced to dye for hunger, and he neuer eateth morſell withoute a thouſande griefes, the which thinge chaū
                  ſeth not to vs. For when there wanteth anye thinge in the place, where wee are, we go moſt happelye into an other.
            
            
               Vli.
               So that we alſo can not cauſe thynges to come out of thoſe countries, where there is haboundaunce, when there is dearthe in our owne.
            
            
               Mo.
               But wyth what labour and daunger both by ſea and lande? And with what vnquietnes of

mynde? the which is a farre greater matter. Let this ſuffiſe thee that your life is nothing els then a continuall ſtryfe, now with one thing, and nowe with an other, ſo that you haue good reaſon to wepe as ye do when you are borne (the whiche none of vs doth) conſidering the infelicitie and miſ

               I beleue not but I thinke, that thoſe teares, the which fall at certaine tymes from their eyes, growe by ſuperfluitye that aſcendeth to the hedde: for that the horſe is a verye delicate beaſt.

So that Vliſſes labour no more, for I for my parte, am one of thoſe, that wil rather dye then become man agayne.

               O my Moule, it ſemeth thou ſhouldeſt alſo haue done, as I ſayde to yonder Oyſter, that at one time thou loſt ye ſhape of man and reaſon alſo. And yf thou wilte ſee that to be true that I tell the: conſyder what beaſtes you are, for yf you wer perfit in dede, I woulde ſaye that you hadde ſome reaſon.

               Why, what dooe we lacke?
            
            
               Vli.
               What do you lacke? Thoyſter the ſenſe of ſmellinge and hearynge, and that that is more, the abilitie to moue frome one place to another: And thou the fyghte, the whiche thou knoweſte howe

worthy it is to be hadde in price, geuynge knowledge vnto vs of mo differences of thynges, then any other ſenſe.
            
            
               Mo.
               We are not therefore vnperfite, but we are ſo called by you, in reſpect of thoſe that haue theym all: but we ſhoulde be imperfit in dede, yf we lacked any of thoſe that belongeth vnto oure kynde.

               Not the ſight to me, as a Moule: neyther to Thoiſter the ſmellinge, or hearynge, or abilitie to go from place to place, as an Oyſter. And yf thou wilt knowe the reaſon thereof, herken vnto me? Tell me I pray the, why is the power to moue from one place to another geuen vnto you, but to go for thoſe thinges that ye lacke?

               And why ſo? Syns it is not neceſſarye to my nature, it is ſufficient to me, to be perfit in myne owne kynde. Deſyreſt thou to haue the bryghtnes that a ſtarre hath: or the winges that a byrd hath?

               Theſe are thinges that appertaine not to menne.

               And the like would I do, yf other moules ſaw: but ſince other ſee not, I neyther thinke on it, nor yet deſyre it. So that labour no farther in perſwadinge me to retourne man, for that I am perfecte in thys my kynd, and liue without anye thoughte in the worlde, I will ſo remaine, becauſe I fynd herein farre fewer diſpleaſures, then I dyd in the humayne lyfe.

               Vli.
               Ye but then the matter is, whether this come by the ſmal knowledge of them or not? For ſurely they ſhould be men of moſt litle witte, ſins that ſtate wherein they were, ſemed euyll vnto theym, & yet they not able to chaunge it.

               The wit and wiſedome of men is farre better knowen, in being able to accommodate them ſelues to liue quietlye, in that ſtate wherin they are, then it is in chaunginge it, as alſo in the knowledge of players, in playing thoſe games well, that come to them by chaunce, althoughe they be euyll For in thone, knowledge and wiſedome worke onely, and in thother fortune: vnto whoſe arbitrement wyſe men alwaies ſeke the leaſt they may to put thē ſelues.

               Thou knoweſt Circes that there is no kynde of creatures, amongeſt whom greter differences are found, then among men, among whom yf thou conſider well thou ſhalt find ſome of ſuch knowledge and wytte, that they are almoſt lyke vnto the goddes, and ſome others of ſo groſſe wytte, and ſmall knowledge, that they

               Cir.
               Yf the good and the euylles that chaunce vnto a man in that ſtate wherin he liueth, coulde onelye be knowen by witte, and vnderſtanding, I wold then thinke thou ſaydeſt truth. But they are knowen by profe: and experience (as thou knoweſt) cauſeth eche man to knowe thynges as they are. But abyde, yu ſhalt ſpeake a lytle with that Snake that commeth trauerſing the way towardes vs, for as I remember me, he whome I chaunged into her, was a Gretian, and he perchaunce ſhall ſatiſfie the farre better,

And manye after this ſorte knowe it, & I alſo knewe my parte thereof. Phiſike maye lykewiſe be conſidered as an arte, and artes (as thou knoweſt) come by experience, and after thys ſorte it is moſt deceitfull: and that this is true phiſitions them ſelues confeſſe it: ſaying that experiences in this arte are very deceitfull. And thus it appertayneth vnto the actiue, the ende wherof is the workynge and trauaylinge aboute the particuler thinges, and in this ſorte I confeſſe vnto the yt ther is moſt litle knowē therof

               I knewe it verye well, for, for beynge able to ſpeake well, and to perſwade well, and chiefelye vnto women (to whoſe myndes phiſitions are moſt tymes taken,

and not for being able to worke well) I became in great credite. But abide Vliſſes, wilt thou ſee that men knowe not phiſicke perfectly that geue a thouſand remedies for one diſeaſe?

               Cleane contrary, for the geuing many remedies to one euyll, is a token of not knowing his proper remedy. For euen as all effectes, haue only one proper occaſion, that cauſe them, although they may be afterwarde brought forthe accidentally by many other occaſions, ſo euery euill hath his proper remedie, and who that knowe it ſhould heale the ſame vndoutedly. So that when thou ſeeſt one geue thee many remedies to one onely euill, ſaye that he knoweth not the very proper remedie, and goeth about to ſeke it. And then it muſt be (as they ſay) that God muſte helpe you.

For he is wel called fortunate, the more parte of whoſe buſines hath good ende, and that in things doutefull he euer chanſeth to take the beſt. For as I haue tolde thee, it is ſo harde a thinge in phiſycke, to apply vniuerſals, to perticulers, that the pacient hath nede of good chaunce, or elſe he is in greate haſarde.

Fyrſt for that ſhe hath geuen you a complexion ſo weke, and an appetite ſo vnordinate, and then for that ſhe hath taught you phiſicke after ſuch ſorte that it is rather to your hurte then profyte.

               Yea, yf ſhe had geuen you therewith an appetite, ruled in ſuche ſorte, that you dranke not thereof more then you neded: but ſynce ſhe hath not done ſo, it is euen to haue geuen a thyng that is of no leſſe hurte then helpe, into the hand of one that hath no iudgement, or elles will ſuffer him ſelfe to be ledde vp and downe by deſyre.

Haue not al the litle Lyzardes, one certaine herbe that helpeth them, when they haue benne bitten by any of vs? Runne not the harts whē they are wounded vnto Dittaunder? And whē they perceaue them ſelues bytten by the Phalange (the which is a kynd of a venemous ſpyder) can they not, all heale themſelues with eatinge of crabbes or crauiſhes? The ſwalowes when they ſee the eyes of their younge hurt, can not al they helpe them with celidonye? The Tortoflees helpe they not our bytinges wyth

hemlocke? The weſell when ſhe goeth to fyght with the ratte, doth ſhe not fyrſt make her ſelfe ſtronge and luſty with eating of rue? helpeth not the Storke her infirmities with organie? And the wylde ſwine with Juie? Doth not the Elephant defend him from the venun of the Camal

The cattes and dogges when they fele their bealy ouercharged, ronne they not to pourge them ſelues with eatinge of graſſe wet with dewe? But what nedeth that I tell thee any longer ſtory? take what kinde of beaſt thou wilt, and thou ſhalte fynde, that for thin firmitie, wherevnto the ſame is ſubiecte, nature hathe taught him the remedy. And not onelye to the kynde alone (as I haue tolde thee) but to euery one of them ſeuerally deuyded, wherby it followeth that we haue no

nede to bye labour one of another, neither haue we any nede to put our ſelues vnder doutfull thinges. And that that is worſe, to paye one who may often times geue vs our death, as you poore wretches do. And doth it not ſeme vnto you, that how much the more monye you geue, to your Phiſitions, ſo much the better to do?

               But the matter is, whether they that thou calleſt foles, be wiſer then thothers, or not. For I remember that one, who

was heled of that diſeaſe, being aſked by a woman, what phiſicke he had vſed, bycauſe ſhe would heale a childe of hers, ſaid that he woulde not teache it her, thynkynge he ſhould do to great an iniurye to heale one of ſuch a diſeaſe, for he thought that he had neuer a pleaſaunter tyme then whiles he was taken for a ſole.

               Ye peraduenture vnto vs that are prouyded by nature, of all thoſe thinges that are neceſſary for vs, and that lyue alwayes in helth, withoute any ſorowe or griefe at all. (So that to dye alſo is litle griefe vnto vs, for we foreſee not oure death

before hand as you do, and beſides that we knowe not ſo perfectly this to loſe the being, to be ſo great a matter. But this great felicitie of yours to liue ſo long is none other thinge vnto you, then a painefull ſuffering a longer time, with ſo many troubles and laboures to preſerue your life. And when you haue but a griefe in the head, the feare of death tormenteth you ſo much, that the griefe of the mind is farre greater vnto you then the paine of the bodie. So that ther haue bene many, that for this occaſion haue ſayd that your life can not be called a life, but a continuall courſe and thinkinge of death.
            
            
               Vli.
               Theſe are but wordes.

               As though that there hath not bene among you alſo of thoſe, who conſidering your miſerie hath ſayd it had bene better neuer to haue bene borne. And of thoſe that are borne, they may onely be called happie, that die in theyr ſwadling bandes. And how many haue there alſo bene, who conſideringe your ſtate, to make thēſelues free of ſo many euils haue killed thē ſelues with their owne handes?

A thing ſo wicked, that it neuer commeth only in the thoughte of anye of vs.
            
            
               Vli.
               Ye, ſome weake harted perſon, who being afeard for that he knoweth not howe to ouercome ſome contrarye fortune, or to beare out ſome euell that is chaūced vnto hym, but for one of theſe thou ſhalt finde thouſandes, that woulde not dye.

               Ye, but thou knoweſt not the cauſe.
            
            
               Vli.
               Why what is it? tell it me I praye thee.
            
            
               Sna.
               The fearinge to go into a worſer ſtate, for the feare that many haue put you in, by writinge of the kingedome of Pluto, wher ſo many ſharpe puniſhmentes are prepared for ſuch of you as hath paſſed the marke of reaſon, a lyttle to ſatiſfie ſometyme his deſires, on the whiche thynge we neuer thinke. But yf men thoughte to ende their life, and their troubles at one tyme, thou ſhouldeſt ſee thinges that would make thee maruell, there are ſo manye mo of thoſe amonge you that painfully ſuffer, and are in euill caſe then thoſe that ioye and be in good caſe.
            
            
               Vli.
               Ageſimus, I ſee thou art ſo obſtinate, that thou wilt neuer be

                  able to perceyue

reaſon: wherfore I will diſpute no more wyth thee, and chiefely becauſe I haue ſene in this laſte, that thou haſte altogether loſt thy knowledge, begynning to doubte of religion, thynges euen conuenyente to a beaſte as thou arte. And truly I am not a litle ſorye for thee, yet for the loue I beare vnto thee, for that thou art a Gretian, yf thou wilte become manne agayne, I will cauſe the ſo to do, for Cyrces hath graunted me ſo, and then mayeſt thou afterwardes retourne wyth me into thy countrye.
            
            
               Sna.
               No not I, for I praye hym to kepe me from that, that may for euer.

               Seeſt thou not what an vnhappy ſtate thine is: and a beaſt of whom menne make little of?
            
            
               Sna.
               And this is the thing that I derely loue: for the much makyng of, that men make vnto beaſtes, is all for theyr owne profyttes, and to be ſerued in their nedes by them.

               And you ſleape the halfe of yours, and farre more vnquietlye then we.
            
            
               Vli.
               Then what

pleaſures haſt thou? thou eateſt nothynge but earthe, or ſome foule beaſt, and thou drinkeſt nothing but water.
            
            
               Sna.
               What matter is this yf I haue no deſyre of any other thynge?
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou haſt thy knowledge alſo imperfecte, and thys commeth becauſe thy parte imaginatiue, and fantaſie, are confuſed.

               And what knoweſt thou hereof?
            
            
               Vli.
               I ſee it by experience, for all you beaſtes that ſlyde wyth the body on the grounde, ſtayinge the former parte of you wyth your ſcales, and afterwarde pluckinge and drawing after the hinder part, when the waye croketh vnto you, you go vnto an other place. And you retourne not by the way that you firſt went. And of whence commeth this, but that you haue a confuſed fantaſie, and ſuch a remembraunce as the flye alſo hath, wherby you determine no more vnto one place, thē vnto an other but are guyded by chaunce?
            
            
               Sna.
               In dede I ſhould haue a confuſed fantaſie to become manne againe: for I ſhould continually be full of humoures and of vayne thoughtes, wher as after thys ſorte I liue contented, and wythoute anye thought

at al. And I ſhould alſo haue leſſe remembraunce, to be willing to retourne into a ſtate, full of ſo many troubles and myſeryes. So that labor no more Vlyſſes, for I will none of this thy fauor, for it wyll put me vnder a thouſand infirmities, and I ſhould neuer be able to enioy one deſire aſſuredlye, but rather for euerye lyttle ſurfette, I ſhould feele a thouſande ſorowes: And that yt is worſe, I ſhould haue nede to kepe my ſelfe from death, being ſubiecte to meyminge me, and to lyue euer after myſhapen and ſicke. So that go on thy waye, for I will go to rubbe my ſcales a lytle on yonder gineper, becauſe I maye moue it the eaſelier, where I ſhal fele ſo much pleaſure, and delite, that perchaunce I neuer proued the lyke being man, for that it ſhalbe without reſpecte or any diſpleaſure at all, whereas youres are euer mingled with ſuch bytternes, that manye of you, ſpeakynge thereof haue ſayde, a thouſande pleaſures were not worthe one trouble or tormente.
            
            
               Vli.
               In thende I haue to do with beaſtes. And although Circes geue them power

to ſpeake and aunſwere me, yet (as me thinketh) ſhe hath not geuen them their wittes, for they conſider onely certayne of the leaſt thinges, and not that that importeth. But yet I will not leue ſo fayre an enterpriſe, for I will retourne vnto Circes, that ſhe may cauſe me to ſpeake to the reſt that are here, to do good vnto thoſe that are better able to perceiue. For as the prouerbe ſayeth: euell may be done to one by force, but good neuer.

               YF I knewe not howe gret the loue were that thou beareſt me moſt noble Cyrces, I ſhould doubt in dede that thou wouldeſt not graunte me the fauour that I haue aſked of thee. And thou not willing to denye it me, haſt onely cauſed me to ſpeake with ſuch as thou knoweſt had there mind ſo determined, not to become men againe, that any man could neuer perſwade them, and ſo I might leue thenterpriſe.
            
               Cir.
               Let neuer any ſuch thought enter into thy minde of me Vliſſes. For this apperteineth neither to the loue that I beare thee, nor yet to the mightines and noblenes of my mynd, euer geuen to moſt glorious enterpriſes: for thou knoeſt wel, that he, who can not forbeare pleſures, can not alſo do them.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou haſt cauſed me to ſpeake with one, who is more obſtinate then thoſe others. And

wheras I thought to do him a good torne, in making him returne man, & leding him againe into his countrie, his obſtinacie blindeth him ſo much, yt he ſaith he ſhould do farre worſe to chaunge that ſtate with this.
            
            
               Cir.
               Yf thou Vlyſſes haddeſt alſo proued theyr ſtate, thou wouldeſt peraduenture do the lyke.

               This fellowe whiles he was man ſaith he was a phiſitiō who as thou knoweſt, neuer ſee any other thing then hurtes, griefes, filthines, & ſickneſſes of men, they neuer here any other thing then lamentations, and wepinges, wherof he now remembring him ſelf, (becauſe the euil is euer better kept in mynd, then the good) he wil not I think become man againe.

               In al ſtates of men the troubles & miſeries are many mo, then the contentations, and felicities.

               Then had that our wiſe man done il, if it wer ſo, who among other thinges, for the which he gaue dayly thankes vnto the goddes, thanked them, for that they had made him man, & not a beaſt.
            
            
               Cir.
               He did ſo, becauſe ſuch is thoppinion of the greater part of men, led by thoſe reaſonnes, that maye

be gathered by reaſonable diſcourſe. But more credite ſhould be geuen vnto thoſe who hauing proued the one life and the other, know it by experience, and by the ſenſitiue knowledge, the whiche paſſeth not onely and excedeth all others in aſſurednes, but is alſo the beginninge and foundation of all.
            
            
               Vli.
               Yea, but the life of beaſtes ſhuld not be compared to ours, for that it is much more imperfecte.
            
            
               Cir.
               I beleue not this: for I ſee many beaſtes, that haue theyr ſences farre more perfecte then you, and that in operation of them, paſſe you very farre.
            
            
               Vli.
               Ye truly they paſſe vs in ſome perticuler ſence, as for example, the Egle in ſeing, the Dogge in ſmelling, and the Goſe in hearinge: but they are then ſo farre inferior vnto vs in iudgement of ſenſible thinges, becauſe they haue not the common ſence ſo perfect as we, and that they lacke altogether the reaſonable diſcourſe, and ablenes in comparing one ſence with an other, for our ſenſitiue knowledges are farre perfecter then theirs. But cauſe me to ſpeake with ſome other, 
                     •
                  or I thinke not that

all haue ſo loſt the true knowledge of reſonne, as theſe three haue, to whom I haue ſpoken, whom truly thou haſt not chaunged into ſuch an vnperfect kinde of beaſtes, without a cauſe, ſins they lyke men haue ſo imperfect a diſcourſe.

               I am contented thou ſhalt ſpeake with yonder Hare, that thou ſeeſt feadinge at the ſhadowe of yonder Oke: Go thither and call him, for I haue graunted him to ſpeake.
            
            
               Vli.
               Hare (as God geue thee that that thou deſyred) runne not away, but tary me, and withſafe to anſwer me, for Cyrces hath told me, that thou canſt ſo do.
            
            
               Ha.
               Alas, what meaneth this? I haue agayne the vnderſtanding of the ſignification of the ſpeache of man: Oh my vnhappy chaunce, why haſte thou brought me agayne into ſuche miſerie?
            
            
               Vli.
               Calleſt thou it then miſerie to vnderſtande the ſpeache of man?
            
            
               Ha.
               Myſery, and moſte great infelicitie, yf they haue not chaunged theyr nature, ſynce the tyme that I was a man.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what is the occaſion Hare?
            
            
               
               Ha.
               Alas, whiles I was man, I neuer hearde other then lamentyng and ſorowinge moſt bitterlye one with another.
            
            
               Vli.
               Surely, I haue auoyded one miſchiefe, and am runne into another. Thother was a phiſition, wherby he neuer practiſed but the ſicke, and euill contented perſons: and this by as much as I can perceiue, ſhould neuer haue practiſed but with deſperates.
            
            
               Ha.
               Theſe thinges were often vnto me occaſion of ſuch ſorowe, that I would farre rather haue abyden in a wood, where I ſhould neuer haue ſeene the ſteppes of men, and truely I would haue done it, yf the nature of man could haue borne it. But thou knoweſt that man hath nede of ſo many thinges, that he can not liue alone, but with a thouſand incommodities.
            
            
               Vli.
               And doſt thou heare no beaſt alſo lament?
            
            
               Ha.
               It is true: For when thoſe of mine owne kynd haue any griefe, I knowe it ſtreight by the voyce: for it is naturall to euery beaſt, to ſhewe with the varietie of the ſound of his voice, whether he be mery or ſory. But theſe ſuch naturall voyces

ſhewe me onely theyr griefe in generall: the whiche kinde of ſorowinge, is farre eaſier to be borne, then the ſorowinge of man, who, beſides the lamentyng with ſyghtes and malincolie, and ſorowfull accentes, increaſeth with ſhewinge his myſeries, and the occaſion of his griefe, muche more the compaſſion, very ofte to them that heare it. Alas, I neuer heard beſydes the ſightes that hee naturallye caſteth, that is malincolie) other thinge ſpoken of, then manſlaughters, treaſon, theftes, robberies, and ſo cruell wickednes, that one man did to another, that mooſte often tymes the compaſſion of others troubled me more, then the pitie of my ſelfe.
            
            
               Vli.
               Tel me (if it pleaſe thee) what ſtate was thyne, whiles thou lyuedeſt man?
            
            
               Ha.
               I chaunged ſo many, that I can not tell which to tell the. But what moueth the, ſo to deſyre, to knowe what my ſtate was?
            
            
               Vli.
               The loue that one naturallye beareth vnto thoſe that are of hys Countrey, and this hath cauſed me to deſyre of Cyrces, to reſtore vnto all my Grotians, the ſhape

ſhape of man. And for that I vnderſtode by her, that thou were one of them, I would do the this pleaſure: becauſe I alſo am a Gretian, and am called Vliſſes.
            
            
               Ha.
               To me thou ſhalt not reſtore it, if I be not enforſed therevnto.
            
            
               Vli.
               Why ſo? Is it not better to be a man, then a brute beaſte?
            
            
               Ha.
               No, for any thing that I knowe.
            
            
               Vli.
               And art thou then vtterly determined, that thou wylte conſume thy life in this body of a beaſt?
            
            
               Ha.
               That I am: For liuing thus a beaſt, I liue contented and quiet in my kynde: where as beyng man, I was neuer contented in any ſtate.
            
            
               Vli.
               But the matter is, whether this were through thine owne faute, or not, and for that thou were ſo vnſatiable, that thou couldeſt not content thy ſelf with that that was reaſonable?
            
            
               Ha.
               I ſhould be in doubte hereof, ſauinge for that I neuer founde any man, in what eſtate ſo euer it were (and yet I practiſed ynough) that was perfectly contented. But tell me I pray thee: what thing hath manne, that ſhoulde cauſe him to lyue contented? For eyther he is putte by fortune

in ſtate where he hath to commaund and to prouyde for others: or els he is commaunded, and ruled by others.
            
            
               Vli
               In both theſe ſtates (yf he be wiſe) he may be contented.
            
            
               Ha.
               Nay rather in none. For yf he be a prince, and Lorde, and haue to gouerne others, yf he do as he ought to do, he neuer hath one howre of reſte, beſides the craftes, and deceiptes, that he ſhould alwaies feare, becauſe they daylye growe, by the enuye that is borne hym. Knoweſt thou not that a prince holdeth in his principalitie, the place that the moſt high and mightie GOD holdeth in the whole worlde? Who hath with his wiſedome to care for all thynges: whereby it is commonly ſayd, that all his ſubiectes ſlepe wyth the eyes of hym. What pleaſure wilte thou then that he haue?
            
            
               Vli.
               Mooſte greate pleaſure, ſeinge theym to lyue Ciuillye, and to loue well one another: becauſe hereof he ſeeth a glorye, and honoure ſprynge, that maketh him immortall.
            
            
               Ha.
               Ye, but where are theſe Subiectes. Are they

perchaunce lyke vs beaſtes, who folowe that thing only, wherunto nature inclyneth vs. Seeſt thou not, that by this neuer being contented, that man hath by nature (as I thinke) ſo many tumultes, ſo many craftes, and ſo many ill workes ſpringe, that thou canſt fynd no realme at al, where there are not ſo great hatreds that it ſhould be better to liue in a moſt ſharpe and abandaned deſert, and amongeſt the moſt cruell beaſtes that may be found, thēm what wel gouerned realme ſoeuer it be amongeſt menne.
            
            
               Vli.
               Say not ſo, for a good Prince canne kepe hys people vnder the lawes, in ſuch ſorte, that theſe troubles that thou ſpeakeſte of, take litle place there.
            
            
               Ha.
               And howe may this be done vnto ſo peruerſe a nature as mans is, but with moſte greuous paynes, and with ſo cruell punyſhments, for the fearmge of ill doers, that they geue perchaunce no leſſe griefe to the geuer of them, then to them that ſuffer the? yf you be not crueller then we be, who dare not offende one an other of vs, being

of one kinde, nor yet to hurte thoſe of another kinde, yf we be not cōſtrained thervnto by hunger, or that we do it, for ſome geloſie, or ſome feare, or for our owne ſauegarde.
            
            
               Vli.
               Truelye it canne not be denied, that in the places of higheſt aucthoritie, there are not manye mo thoughtes, and troubles, then pleaſures. And chiefely in thoſe who loue the ſafegarde of their ſubiectes in ſuche ſorte as apperteineth. But let vs let this paſſe, for it chaunſeth to fewe to be a Prince, let vs ſpeake of a priuate perſon, who hath none other to thinke on, then him ſelfe and hys houſehold.

                  ſeth the like: for eyther he is ryche, or he is poore: amongeſt the riche thinke not to fynde any contented, for the nature of ryches is, to bring ſo great feare for the keping theym, that the poſſeſſoures of them, haue neuer one only howre, a quiet mynde. And one while they are in feare of warres, or of other miſfortunes yt tyme & the worlde bringeth, nowe they doute of theyr wyues, and nowe of their children, nowe they feare their ſeruauntes.
               
                  And finally gold hath ſo many enemyes, that who that hath therof, ſtandeth euer in doute. Yf he be pore I wil ſay nothing to the thereof, ſins there is nothinge on earth more harde to ſuffer then pouertye,
            
            
               Vli.
               I will not yet herein beleue thee altogether, becauſe I haue heard ſay, that manye of our wiſe men, haue praiſed it and loued it much. And there haue ben of thoſe who to be the more frely able to plai the philoſophers, haue deſpiſed and caſte ryches awaye.
            
            
               Ha.
               The greater parte of them, and perchaunſe all, haue done it for ambition, and to thintent they woulde be accounted gret and rare, among men. And there are alſo of thoſe, that haue caſt awaye an ounce of golde, to get a pound thereof againe. For the common people haue euer this cuſtome, that when they ſe one diſpyſe a thyng, then they geue it hym willinglye.
            
            
               Vli.
               Then I ſee thou wylt haue thyne owne wordes, I tel the, that I haue ſene many, that haue lyued in pouertie moſt contented, and with moſt great quyetnes of mind, and chiefely ſuch as were wiſe.
            
            
               Ha.
               And I tell thee, that

they haue fained it, doing like wiſe men, becauſe they wold not haue both fortune and the world, laugh at them at once. 
                     •
                   But rather I wil ſay more vnto the hereof, that by how much the more one is of knowledge by ſo much the more his grefe is, to be poore.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what is the reaſon hereof?
            
            
               Ha.
               The conſidering the wronge that fortune hath done hyin, in making him pore, and an infinite numbre of fooles riche.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou cauſeſt me now to remember a ſaying of a frende of mine that ſayde, that goodes did moſt commonly lyke the rume, who falleth euer in the wekeſt place.
            
            
               Ha.
               The diſdaine alſo that they haue, tormenteth them continually, ſeing, that of that that nature hath made for al men (for ſhe ſhould do againſt her order, yf ſhe brought not ſufficientlye forth for all men of that, that they neded) there aduaunſeth ſo muche vnto one that he maketh hauocke thereof, and vnto an other there lacketh. And thys commeth onely, becauſe he who can do moſt, wyll take moſt. Wher as amongeſt vs it is not ſo: becauſe none deſyreth, or can poſſeſſe

any thinge that nature hath made for vs, more then an other.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou wouldeſt then make good the opinion of thoſe that ſaye, that it is not ill done to robbe, becauſe the goodes of this worlde, hathe byn ſo many tymes ſtollen, that the true maiſters therof, haue them no more, but let him that can get them take them.
            
            
               Ha.
               This onely is ſufficient for thee Vliſſes, that pouertie is a thing ſo ſharpe and heuye, that menne to flye it, abaſe them ſelues euen to become ſeruantes one with an other, the whyche is a thinge ſo foule, that among vs beaſtes there is none ſo vyle, that would not rather ſuffre death then to put hym ſelfe wyllyngly to ſerue an other of his owne kynd, to amende his neceſſaries. But nature hath loued vs ſo much better then ſhe hath done you. For amongeſt vs this infelicitie is not knowē but rather euery one of vs, hath ben made by her of ſuch valor, that he can rule hym ſelfe.
            
            
               Vli.
               Yet there muſt be ſome other thing then pouertie, that cauſeth men to become ſeruauntes one with an other, for many that are riche are ſene to do that.
            
            
               Ha.
               Rather they are more poore then thothers,

yf you well conſider it, becauſe they are poore of noblenes of harte, or els of counſell: by the which they can not refraine their vniuſt deſyre, whereby they ſeke to get a name, or aucthoritie, or immoderatelye to ſatiſfye their couetous deſyres, by makyng theym ſelues ſeruauntes to others.
            
            
               Vli.
               And he that were in a meane ſtate, in the which he mought reaſonablye contente him ſelfe.
            
            
               Ha.
               And where is thys ſtate? I for my parte neuer found any man, who ſaid not, that eyther he lacked ſomething, or yt he had to much, Although theſe were moſt fewe, who remembred it, when they ſawe them ſelues nygh thende of their life
                     •
                  , lamentyng thē of the paines that they hadde ſuffered in theyr youth, to gette goodes, to haue afterwarde moughe at theyr death.
            
            
               Vli.
               Theſe are fautes that growe, for the man can not refrayne, and meaſure hys deſyres, and not of hys owne proper nature.
            
            
               Ha.
               It ſemeth to me al one, ſins nature hath ordeined, that he may deſyre thoſe thynges that are after hurtfull and troubleſome vnto hym. The which thing

for that ſhe loued vs better, ſhe hath not done to vs. And I remember that in that age, in the which I began to haue ſome knowledge, my father who was a great gentle man of Ethalia, and endued wyth great ryches, putting me vnder the kepynge of a mayſter, who taught me certaine thinges of the mathematicals (after the cuſtome of the Gretians) I beganne to conſider, that man knewe nothynge, excepte he were taught it. The whyche thyng in that age ſemeth very harde, not ſo much for the difficultie of thinges, and for the keping vnder of the maiſter, as for the childiſhe deſyres, that the ſame tyme bryngeth with it: for I lyued verye euil contented, and yet I lacked nothyng
            
            
               Vli.
               Of thys age there ſhould be lyttle hede taken, becauſe it is moſt unperfecte.
            
            
               Ha.
               Then folowing farther, the death of my father chaunced, whereby I began to ſtryue wyth my brethren for the inheritaunce, alwaies truſting whiles I was in theſe trauailes, that when they were ended, I ſhould lyue contented, & in moſte

quiet reſt: but it came all contrary vnto me. For as I had my part, wherof part was poſſeſſions, and part money, thoughtes increaſed. And being vſed to be gouerned, me thought it then moſt great paynes to do the ſame my ſelfe, and others I truſted not. For being enforced for the maintening of my ſubſtaunce, to practiſe both with huſbandmen, and with marchauntes, I perceiued that ecke of them, ſtode continually watchinge, to make that that was mine, his: for to let a farme vnto a huſbandman, is nothinge elles then to be partener with a thiefe. And to put thy goodes vnto a marchaunt, to trade with one that thinketh to deceiue thee of them. And notwithſtanding, I marked that neither of them was contented with his ſtate, and they did neuer other then lamente continually, the one of the earth that yelded not, for the euill diſpoſition of the wether, and of the litle eſtimation they were had in. And the other of euill wyndes, of ill fortune, of the ſmall ſafety of the ſea, and of the diſcord of Princes, that let
                     •
                  eth the exerciſe

               Vli.
               Euerye bodye muſte haue ſomething to trouble hym, euen you alſo haue ſome thinges yt trouble you.
            
            
               Ha.
               Ye but for euery one that we haue, you haue a thouſand. But heare the reſte a lyttle, in thys meane ſeaſonne, bothe for the neceſſities that chaunce to the lyfe of man, and for to defend me that mine owne were not taken from me (for all men are theues, but their meanes of robbing are dyuerſe) I hadde to practyſe with an infinite number of craftes men, of men of lawe, and procters, and be thou aſſured that I neuer founde anye one of thoſe crafteſmen that liued contented: for all they holding their eyes on the riche, lamente that they muſt get their breade. And amonge thoſe other aduocates, and men of lawe they complained of the like, for all they lamented dayly, that had to ſtriue and contende, to procure them the thynges that were neceſſarye to the lyfe of manne.
            
            
               Vli.
               Whoſoeuer hath to do with the, ſhal ſone repent it: but it is little trouble to thē, alwaies to ſtryue for other mennes gooddes.
            
            
               Ha.
               He that troubleth

others reſteth not in quiet him ſelfe.
               Thou conſidereſt not alſo the hatred they get thereby, and how much they are abhorred, when they are not neded, and in what ſort they are taken.
            
            
               Vli.
               This is very true, that I remember, diſputinge once in one of our vniuerſities of Grecia, it was in queſtion who ſhould goo before in the fyrſt place, eyther men of lawe, or phiſitions, and it was concluded that the man of lawe ſhould go before, onely by this example, that when execution is commaunded to be done, the thefe goeth before, and the hangeman cōmeth after.
            
            
               Ha.
               And when I ſawe the euill contentation of all theſe ſtates, and deſiring to auoide the ſame, I thought that if I ſhould fynd quietnes in any ſtate, it ſhould be in the ſtate of our prieſtes, who taking them ſelues from the world, abide in thoſe their congregations to ſerue the gods, holding all in common, and ſuffering them ſelues to be ruled by one of theyr owne ſort. And ſo ſaſtening my ſelfe to this, I determined to leaue the world, and to go liue in one of thoſe congregations. The which

purpoſe I cold not long obſerue, for euen as I began to lene a litle vnto thē, I ſmelt the ſauours of their diſcordes, and infelicities, and how euery one of them, ſeking by al meanes (although vniuſt) to be chief, betraied & hurted thothers. I perceiued alſo the diſpleaſures that thei toke, for that thei had to kepe thoſe obediences, to mainteine them vniuerſallye in the eſtimation of goodnes, the which bringeth them wherwith to liue: the trouble alſo and werynes that the ſhetting in is vnto them, the paynes they take to perſwade men that they are more frendes of the goddes, then they who ſerued the worlde, with thoſe lawes onely that God and nature, haue geuen vs. So that I fled ſo farre with my mynd from them, that I neuer remembred them more. Then I thought to liue like a gentleman, attending to braueries, and paſſinge the time in hawkinge and huntinge, and in ſuche like pleaſures.
            
            
               Vli.
               Yf thou ſought this ſtate to haue found quietnes there, I can tell thee, that thou wenteſt farre out of the way, and much more alſo in feates of armes.

For in theſe two liues, the which I my ſelfe haue proued, I know very wel, ther is none that lyueth contented.
            
            
               Ha.
               For that I thought I ſhould fynde no quietnes in warre, I would not proue it. And beſides this, I thought it a foliſhnes, not fightyng for ones country, or for his honeſtye, or for ſome other lawfull cauſe to fell hys owne lyfe for anye kynde of hyer. For ſins we haue but once to come into this worlde, me thinketh that aſmuche gold as euer nature made, or ſhal make, could not paye for the lyfe of one man. Then alſo perſeyuing that to liue lyke a gentleman, there neded a multitude of ſeruauntes, who are all our enemies, and dayly do thinges whereby a thouſand
                     •
                   diſpleaſures grow vnto vs, thinking it a moſt harde thinge to finde contentation there, I chaunged my mind from that holely. And finally thinking in ſeruing a Prince, not in handy craftes, but in honorable affayres, to fynd ſome contentation of mynd, I determined with the lytle lerning I had, to ſetle me to that practiſe,

wher, by and by I found the contrarie of that that I thought. For beſides the paines that it is to ſerue a Prince, and the troubles that in ſuche ſeruice are ſuffered, not being able eyther to ſlepe or eate in due ſeaſon, the which are euen thinges that preſerue our life, the enuy yt reigneth in courtes, and thunkindnes that ſemeth to be in princes towardes thoſe that ſerue them, (who thinke themſelues neuer iuſtly rewarded) without they would geue them theyr hole kingdome, ſuffered me neuer to reſt my mynd, to liue one onely howre contented. Wherby I was deſperate and gaue my ſelfe to ſayling, and ſo there where I thought not, I found my quietnes. For being caried by fortune into this Iſland, I was chaunged by Cyrces as thou ſeeſt, into an hare, the which was as it mought be to you, to be fallen into a moſt pleſaunt ſlepe. For although I knowe not ſo much as I know when I was a man, ſo am I not alſo in ſo much feare.
            
            
               Vli.
               Yea, becauſe thou art a beaſt that feareth not?
            
            
               Ha.
               I feare not thoſe of myne owne kinde, as you do, the

whiche is ſufficiente for me. Of other thynges I haue no care, thinkinge that thervnto is no defence, as you alſo doo, of the anger of the goddes.
            
            
               Vli.
               It is verye true, that in al theſe ſtates, theſe troubles are as thou ſayeſt, and paraduenture many mo. But then of the pleaſures that be there, thou talkeſt nothing at all.
            
            
               Ha.
               And what pleaſures haue men, in what ſtate ſoeuer it be, that the griefe that they brynge at thende, is not greater then the pleaſure? Knoweſt thou not that our mooſt auncient Greke Poete ſayde: that the pleaſure of this worlde was not the true pleaſure, but was ſorowe, clothed in pleaſures garmentes?
            
            
               Vli.
               Howe ſhewed he this?
            
            
               Ha.
               He ſayde, that when the veſſel that Pandora brought on erth, was opened, whereby all the myſchiefes and humaine myſeries wente foorthe, that then pleaſure wente forth alſo. And goinge abrode in the worlde, he beganne by meanes to drawe men vnto hym, who beganne to folowe him in ſuche ſorte, that none wente any more to heauen. Where▪
                  
ſelfe at thende: For thoughe one wynne as muche mony, as he lad loſt at another tyme, yet maketh he not at all tymes, the lyke full ſumme. And thus all they that vſe it, do yll.
            
            
               Vli.
               I allow not this opinion: for I haue ſene many that haue nothynge, lyue thereby.
            
            
               Ha.
               Yea, when they haue beſtowed thereat, all that they hadde: For playe properly doth as the wie doth, who cleauynge faſte to a good wall, neuer reſteth vntill he haue brought it to ruyne, and then when it is euen fallinge, he holdeth it vp. So lykewyſe playe, when it faſtneth on one that hath ought, it doth ſo that it vndoeth hym, and after when he hath no more, it ſuſtayneth hym. For practiſinge where there is play, fawning and flatterynge hym that wynneth, he pycketh oute a lyuynge mooſte vyl
                     •
                  lye there, the beſt waye he maye. But beleue me Vliſſes: playe is one of the greateſt infelicities, that is geuen vnto the miſfortune of manne. And perchaunce this wicked curſed plague, hath not takenne all the worlde in ſuche ſort
                     •
                  , that the

greater parte of men, ſettinge aparte all laudable and honeſt enterpryſes, doo nothyng els but playe. And there are ſome who drowne them ſelues therein, & there loſe the lyght of reaſon in ſuch wyſe, that they forgette their honeſtie, theyr owne helth, theyr goodes, theyr wyfe, their children, their frends, and finally their own ſelues, and conſumyng therein the thynges neceſſary for their lyuing, bring them ſelues into ſo ſhamefull a pouertie, that they flye the ſight of men, more then we the ſyght of dogges, and chiefely the ſyght of thoſe that knew thē, when they were in better ſtate: and yet they neuer ceaſe to ymagine, howe they may get any lyttle monye, to go playe it, and rather ſuffer the want of thinges that they haue nede of. Therefore marke Vliſſes the pleaſurs that mē haue. Seme they not vnto the rather to be ſorowes?
            
            
               Vli.
               Hare, all are not of this ſort, and man is no more enforced to this thynge then to another. And beſydes thys, he maye by his wiſedome remedy al that, that cauſeth his diſpleaſure.
            
            
               
               Ha.
               Ye but howe hardelye, ſynce all the world is ſo corrupt and noughte? So that perſwade me no more to chaunge this beinge with youres: for I will not retourne out of a ſtate wherin I neuer founde any thoughte at all, to go into an other where I neuer was contented, and wher I ſhall ſee that thinge that nature hath made commune for euery bodye, to be taken from me, by hym that maye do more then I, wherby I muſt by force become hys ſeruaunte, and muſt receyue for hyer of my ſeruice, that thing nigardlye, that nature hath frely geuen me: and where all thoſe delytes that I take, muſt at the ende brynge me ſorowe.
            
            
               Vli.
               I wyll not that thou ſpeake ſo obſtinately. Seeſt thou not howe vyle a beaſt thou arte? and of ſo litle knowledge, that thou knoweſt not whether thou be male or female.
            
            
               Ha.
               Nay you knowe it not, that thinke to know al thinges ſoo well, but we knowe it well ynough.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou haſt feare of euerye thynge, and haſt truſt onely in runnyng away, and yet art thou afterwardes taken by many kyndes of beaſtes.
            
            
               
               Ha.
               And what is that to me, yf my kinde be of that nature?

               Thou art of ſo little lyfe, that euery moſt ſmale hurte, kylleth thee.
            
            
               Ha.
               Alas no more I praye thee, for thou wouldeſt ſo do, that A ſhould thinke it moſt miſerable. Wheras for not knowinge ſo many thinges as you do, I thinke it moſt happye. But go ſeke to dooe this benefyt to ſome others, for I for my parte wyll none of it, and folowing mine owne nature wythout any thoughte, I wyll go fede me on yonder faire grene graſſe that thou ſeeſte on yonder hyll.

               My Hare, me thinketh thou doeſt lyke hym, who beinge put into priſon by certayne hys creditours, prayed thē they would not take hym out from thence, ſayinge: that out of pryſon he had a thouſande thoughtes, both for him ſelfe, and for others, and there being prouided for, by ſuch as were wont to prouyde, he had not one thought in the world: ſo that he thoughte it a goodlye habitation for hym, and thys came all of the weakenes of hys mynde. For yf he had bene a man in dede, he woulde rather

haue bene a pore man abrode, then a ryche man in pryſon, helpynge manfullye with hys wyſedome all that he ſayde. Soo alſo thou by aſmuch as I can perceyue by thy wordes, ſhouldeſt be ſo inſatiable a man, and ſhouldeſt ſo much eſteme euery lytle trouble, becauſe thou couldeſt not boldely ſhewe thy face agaynſt thoſe diſpleaſures that the worlde and fortune brynge, that thou wylte rather remayne in that vyle ſtate of a beaſte, then to retourne man. And knowynge thee ſo, I wyl euen ſuffer thee ſo to remayne: for in doynge otherwyſe, I ſhoulde do that that ſhoulde dyſpleſe the, although it were for thy profyt, and that ſhoulde rather brynge ſhame to oure kynde then honor, as all thoſe other men do that are lyke to thee.

            The fourth Dialoge. Vliſſes, Circes, the Gote.
            
               I Haue alwayes thought moſt noble Circes, that there was a difference betwene one man, and an other: as it is daylye ſayd by prouerbe, by the mouthes of our Gretyans: but yet not ſo greate dyfference as I haue knowen ſyns I ſpake with yonder Hare that thou ſaweſt, or to ſay better with him whom thou haſte tranſfourmed into a Hare.
            
               Cir.
               And why ſoo? wyll he peraduenture become man agayne?
            
            
               Vli.
               Nay rather, much leſſe then thothers, and he hath it in more hatred.
            
            
               Cir.
               Seeſt thou then howe farre thou arte deceyued to lamente thee vnto me, that I chaunged them ſo into beaſtes?
            
            
               Vli.
               And I doo yet lamente, becauſe I am ſtyll

of the ſelte ſame opinion, and thys is, for that I know plainely, that his ferefulnes and lyttle corage, wyll not ſuffre hym to knowe the truthe. Seeſt thou not that he is ſo weke harted by nature, that he hath ſo much fere of euery litle aduerſitie, that he woulde rather chooſe to lyue in euerye moſt vyle bondage without thoughts, thē in anye honeſt degree, with thoſe difficulties that the ſame bringeth with it.
            
            
               Cir.
               Whoe aſſureth thee hereof?
            
            
               Vli.
               He hym ſelfe, whoe wyll rather remaine ſo a beaſt, then retourne man, for the manye troubles, that he thinketh men haue. And yet the confeſſeth, remaynynge ſo, to be in ſuch bondage to nature, and led by her by force that he is not mayſter of hys owne operations. Whereby the deſyre to eate, commyng on hym whyles we were reaſonyng together, and ſeinge certayne graſſe, yt was cōuenient meate for him, he departed from me wyth a very ill wil, for that he had not yet aunſwered me after hys owne mynd, ſaying that he could not chooſe but go feede, for ſo hys nature enforced

hym to do. So that ſe what a weeke harted manne he was, that would rather lyue in a ſeruitude, and in a lyke ſtate, becauſe he thoughte there were ſomewhat fewer diſpleaſures: then to retourne mā, and to be mayſter of hys owne paſſyons, though he muſte ſomewhat ſtryue wyth them: as perchaunce thou haſt heard ſaye, howe many there haue ben of our Gretians, who to auoide ſome bondage, or enforcemente, haue not onelye not cared to ſtryue with the world, and with fortune, but alſo not to pardon euen their owne lyues.
            
            
               Cir.
               This that thou calleſt bondage in hym, or enforcemente, is vnto hym neyther thone nor thother.
            
            
               Vli.
               And whye ſo?
            
            
               Cir.
               Bycauſe hys nature requyreth ſo. Tell me I praye thee, when a ſtone falleth downe, doth he it by force?
            
            
               Vli.
               I thynke not.
            
            
               Cir.
               Therefore he can do none otherwyſe.
            
            
               Vli.
               It is true: but hys nature requyreth ſoo, and that motion that cauſethe hym to good towardes the centre, commyng of an inner power, the which is within the ſame,

called nature, muſte be naturall to hym, and not violente: becauſe the violente motions are thoſe that come be an outwarde power. And therefore, although he can do none otherwyſe: yet it can not be ſayd that he is enforced.
            
            
               Cir.
               He is yet drawen downe by force of hys heauynes.
            
            
               Vli.
               No, not by force, but by nature, beynge naturall vnto hym to be weightie: for yf he wer not ſo weightye, he ſhoulde not bee a ſtone.
            
            
               Cir.
               And ſo it is alſo with the affection of beaſtes, when it is led by nature: and therefore it can not be called enforcement, ſynce ſhe doth alwaies the beſt for them, as ſhe doth in all other thynges: and that that is nede to theyr conſeruation and perfection.
            
            
               Vli.
               And were it not better for them not to be ſo guyded by her, and 
                     •…
                  ble to do there operations more freely?
            
            
               Cir.
               No, for that they haue not the knowledge and the dyſcourſe of reaſon. For they ſhoulde often erre, wheras beyng guyded by her that can not erre, they neuer or very ſeldome fayle.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what certeyntye haſte thou thereof?
            
            
               Cir.
               Experience that I ſee daylye, beynge

conuerſaunte after a certayne ſorte, wyth al the kyndes of them (for of them al, there is ſome one in thys myne Iſelande (where I ſee that none eateth more, then he neadeth of, nor of any thynge that is not fytte for hym, neyther doth he anye other dyſorder at all: wherby all they, that tyme that nature hath appoynted theym to lyue, althoughe it be leſſe then that that ſhe hath geuen to man, lyue in healthe and luſtye, the whiche is not ſo with you.
            
            
               Vli.
               Yf they do no dyſorder at all, whereof then cometh it, that they haue ſhorter lyfe then we?
            
            
               Cir.
               Of the complexion, the whyche was not geuen by nature to theym, ſo temperate as to vs: and by the moyſture, wherof the naturall heate is fedde, wherby lyfe is maynteyned: the whiche moyſture was geuen to theym by nature, more wateryſhe, and leſſe ayryſhe, then oures, whereby it is more eaſelye corrupt. I ſpeake of the greater parte, for there are ſome that lyue farre longer then man, as the Harte and the Elephante.
            
            
               Vli.

                   thou then of the opinion, yt it is better to be

a beaſt then a man?
            
            
               Cir.
               I wyll not determine this matter, nor thou ſhouldeſte not alſo thinke, that I beleue it: for then I ſhould haue changed my ſelf into a beaſt. as I haue done them. But if I ſhould ſay as thou ſayeſt, our talke were at an ende: it ſhould well ſuffiſe the, that I had graū
                  ted the, to tourne into men again, al thoſe that woulde. And thoughe thou haue not yet chaunſed on anye that will, be not yet abaſſhed, but ſeke farther, for thou ſhalt
                     •
                   well ynoughe fynde ſome one that wyll.
            
            
               Vli.
               I wyll euen dooe ſo: For I ſhoulde thynke it to muche ſhame, to haue proued this ſo worthye an enterpryſe in vayne.
            
            
               Cir.
               Go then and ſpeake with the Goate that thou ſeeſte yonder feedinge: for he alſo (as I well remember) was a Gretian.
            
            
               Vli.
               Goate, O Gote, harken I praye thee, yf thou be a Gretian as Circes hath tolde me.
            
            
               Go.
               A Gretian I was whyles I was man, and my name was Cleomenes of Corinthe: but nowe am I not, neyther yet would I be.
            
            
               Vli.
               What, arte thou perchaunce aſhamed of thy contrye?
            
            
               Go.
               Not ſo: For there is none peraduenture

more honorable then that, in all the worlde.
            
            
               Vli.
               What is that then, that thou wouldeſte not.
            
            
               Go.
               Become man agayne. And of this I haue onelye fear, I liue ſo farre better contented thus then I dydde whyles I was manne.
            
            
               Vli.
               I would euen haue offered the this benefit, thynkyng to haue done thee no ſmall good tourne, to reſtore thee, the figure of man, and to take the out of this bondage, and to leade thee agayne to thine owne countrey.
            
            
               Go.
               I thanke the of thy good wyll towardes me: but if this ſhould happen to me, it woulde followe otherwyſe then thou thynkeſt.
            
            
               Vli.
               Whye, what is the cauſe Cleomenes? I haue euer hard ſay by your wiſe men of Gretia, that man is the moſt perfecte & moſt noble creature that is in all the world. Ye, rather he is in certaine wyſe, the ende & lord of al others.
            
            
               Go.
               Truely they did alſo lyke wyſe men to ſay ſo: for one ſhould euer prayſe his own, and ſay that that a man knoweth.
            
            
               V.
               And therefore what ſtate is thine? and what felicitie haſt thou, that thou wilte rather liue thus a beaſte, then to retourne man?
            
            
               
               Go.
               Yf I ſhould recken the commodities to the that we beaſtes haue, thou woldeſt not thinke them cōmodities, nor yet euer ſholdeſt thou be able to vnderſtande them, euen alſo as you can not comprehende the felicitie that you loke after in thys lyfe, or in thother: for that the witte of manne, is to curiouſe and inſatiable. But I wyl tell thee a parte of thoſe euyls that we auoyd, who are ſuche, that yf thou taſte them all well, thou wouldeſt beare ſuche enuye towardes vs, as thou thinkeſt we ſhoulde beare towardes you.
            
            
               Vli.
               Go to then, and tell me thys at the leaſte.
            
            
               Go.
               There are manye myſeryes and euyls, that man is ſubiecte vnto: and that are occaſyons that I wyl thus remaine a beaſt. But it is not poſſible that I ſhould reſon of thē al, for tyme wyll not ſerue: for beyng ſomwhat fed, by mature, who hath noo reſpect to any other thyng then to my conſeruation, prouoketh me to take my reſte: and ſomewhat to ſlepe vnder the ſhadowe of ſome of theſe trees.
            
            
               Vli.
               Tell me at the leaſte for the ſatiſfying of my mynde. ſome one of the principall euylles.
            
            
               
               Go..
               I am contente. Knowe Vlyſſes that man amonge other his infelicities and miſeryes, hath foure, eche one of the whyche onely (when I haue it in remembraunce) cauſeth me to deſyer rather to be, what vyle beaſt ſoeuer it were, then man.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what are thoſe gote?
            
            
               Go.
               The ſmall aſſuraunce that he alwayes hath in hys mynde, of thinges to come, the ſuſpition he hath of them of his own kinde with whome he is enforced to be continually conuerſaunte, and the feare, and reſpecte of the lawes.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou thynkeſt on to manye thynges.
            
            
               Go.
               And the chefe thinge is, to be able to auoyde the not thinkynge on them. Tell me a lytle, begynnyng at the fyrſt: what ſuertye hath man at any tyme, to be able peaceably to enioye one onely hower, the thynges preſente? ſpekyng fyrſt of the common ſorte, who are in the handes of fortune: whome euery one knoweth, howe varyable and ſlypper ſhe is: and afterwarde vnder the power of Prynces, whoo haue onelye theyr wyll for lawe: and the wyll

of man (as thou knoweſt) is moſt inſaciable.
            
            
               Vli.
               In this thou ſayeſt true: yet he that is wyſe, doeth accommodate hym ſelfe to the wyll of thone, and to the commaundemente of thother.
            
            
               Go.
               Yf wee wil ſpeake then of that, that is our owne: who is he that can promiſe him ſelfe the poſſeſſion therof for one onely day freely? for that men are waren ſo couetous, ſince thine and mine came into the world, that euery mā cōtinually watcheth, to thinke in what ſort, aſwell lawful as vnlawful, he may make him ſelfe riche, and an other man poore.
            
            
               Vli.
               Truely men lay many more ſnares for them ſelues, then they do for you.
            
            
               Go.
               Of the continuall feare ye haue, leaſt princes take them from you, eyther by warres, or by a thouſand other meanes, I will ſaye no more, but that I haue ſene menne, who haue bene in ſuche feare, leaſt the ryches they haue had, ſhold haue bin taken from them, that they haue not vſed them: but ſhewinge them ſelues poore, and liuynge myſerably, haue euer kepte theym hydden, whereby they haue not had anye more commoditye by them,

hauinge theim, then they that had theym not: but haue rather hadde thys more, the thought to kepe them.
            
            
               Vli.
               I wyll not that thou ſpeake of couetuſnes: for this is a vyce that cauſeth men to go ſo farre beſydes theym ſelues, that they become not onelye the enemyes of others, but alſo of theym ſelues.
            
            
               Go.
               I wyll not reaſon of the feare then that ye haue of theeues, of ſeruauntes, and of thyne owne wyfe, and chefely yf ſhe be younger then thou, it ſuffiſeth that none of theſe infelicities hath any place amongeſt vs, for we know not fortune, and not hauyng anye dyfference betwene thine and myne, but poſſeſſinge euery thing in common, one of vs ſeketh not to robbe an other. And we hauynge amonge vs no ſuperioritie at all (becauſe al we of one kynd are of like power) feare leſſe, that our owne be taken from vs, by hym that hath more ſtrengthe then wee, wherby we ſhould be cauſed to hyde it.
            
            
               Vli.
               I knowe that theſe thinges, are occaſions of manye thoughtes to men, but he that holdeth his affectiō vnder the rule of reaſon, auoideth the moſt part of them.
            
            
               
               Go.
               And howe ſhall he wyllynglye obey it, that alwayes ſpurneth agayne?
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou knoweſt that vyctorie is neuer gotten wythoute trauell.
            
            
               Go.
               Ye as you ſay, that euer fede your ſelues wyth fayre wordes. Come then to the ſeconde: what beaſte is he, beſydes man, that feareth of thynges that are not preſente?
            
            
               Vli.
               And what feare hath man thereof?
            
            
               Go.
               So great, that he alwayes lyueth in thoughtes. For yf he ſee the wether waxe cloudye, he begynneth to feare, leaſte the harueſt ſhould be euyll. Then yf he heare thunder or ſee lyghtenynge, he is in ſuche feare of the thunder ſtones, that he not onely maketh vowes to the Goddes, but there haue alſo bene of thoſe, that haue fled into caues vnder the earthe, (becauſe it is ſayde, that they go but fyue fote vnder the earthe) or that haue couered them ſelues wyth the ſkynne of a Seall, thinkyng that thys fyſhe onelye, is neuer touched wyth the thunder ſtone.
            
            
               Vli.
               And howe many are there that haue any ſuche feare of lyke thynges?
            
            
               Go.
               They that feare not theſe, feare other thinges. How many

are there among you, that feare ſo much
                     •
                   to be ſycke, that it can not be ſayde, they are at any time in healthe: not vſyng that libertie that healthe graunteth to others in not byndyng them ſelues to anye lawe: wherby they neuer eate of any thyng that pleaſeth them ſo much as theyr appetyte requireth, neyther dare they do any thing
                     •
                   out of that order, that they haue of long

                   tyme vſed: and yf they ſee the ſeaſonne to chaunge any thing from his wonted vſe, eyther with heate or with colde, they are ſo af

                  rde, that they alter theyr humors in ſuche ſorte, that afterwardes they feale them ſelues very euyll.
            
            
               Vli.
               Theſe are ſo fereful men, that euery moſt lytle thing troubleth them.
            
            
               Go.
               And they that are bolder, eyther they lyue but a whyle, or els they weaken theyr nature ſoo muche, that as theyr youthe is paſte, ther appear
                     •
                   on them a thouſande euylles: or at the leaſt remembryng the dyſorders they hau
                     •
                   done, they are in continuall ſuſpition.
            
            
               Vli.
               And doeth not this alſo happen vnto you?
            
            
               Go,
               No: for we alwaies lyue with one ſelfe rule, the which nature hath geuē vs.

But then come to the ſuſpition that you haue, to be forſaken when you are ſycke, and to lacke that gouernaunce that is neceſſary for you, becauſe you haue nede of ſo many thynges: or that your ſubſtaunce peryſhe not, whereby after you ſhoulde lyue with paynes and hardely, when you were recouered. The whiche thinges are not among vs, neuer being ſicke in ſuche ſorte, but that we can gouerne our ſelues thoughe we haue nothinge yt is in propertie to any one of vs.
            
            
               Vli.
               And yet there are ſome of thoſe amongeſt you beaſtes, who for the prickinge of a thorne, or for ſome other chaunſes, had nede to be holpen by vs.
            
            
               Go.
               There are ſo fewe of thoſe, that they can make no number. And then, of the feare of deth that you haue, the which feare we haue not, what canſt thou ſaye to me?
            
            
               Vli.
               Haue not you alſo fere of deth?
            
            
               Go.
               No, yf it be not preſente to vs, or begyn to fele the torment thereof: where as to you, the onelye thinkinge on it, or the knowynge the determinate tyme, bringe you ſoo muche ſorowe, that there haue bene of thoſe, who to be rydde from ſuche

paſſion, haue killed theym ſelues wyth their owne hands, but let vs let this paſſe and come to the care, and thoughte, that you haue of thinges to come. Alas what an infelicitie is yours? not onelye to take thoughte for thoſe thinges whereof you haue nede from daye to daye, but alſo for thoſe that you ſhall haue nede of, a yeare or two to come, and yet you muſt prouide them, and take after continuall hede to thē.
            
            
               Vli.
               So that there is not lykewiſe peraduenture among you beaſtes that doo the lyke?
            
            
               Go.
               And who are they?
            
            
               Vli.
               The Pyſmare whoo layeth vp in ſommer, wherewith to lyue in winter.
            
            
               Go.
               It is true, but this is not, for that ſhe hath any feare, that ſhe ſhoulde lacke at that tyme, wherof to fede her, by ſcarſitie, or any other ſuch occaſiō, as you do when you prouyde you for the tyme to comme, but becauſe ſhe can not ſuffer the colde of the winter (for then ſhe neuer cō
                  meth from vnder the grounde) ſhe carieth her meat thither, wher ſhe hath to abyde: and ſhe is led to the doynge thereof by nature, and not by feare, that ſhe ſhould not

alwaies finde redie on the earth, all that that ſhe neded. For howe wilte thou that we thinke on that that is to come, whoe neither knowe tyme, nor yet the partes thereof?
            
            
               Vli.
               knowe not ye the time, and ther are ſo manye of you, who euery yeare, when the ſpring time commeth, or the faule of the leafe, chaūge coūtries as the ſwalewes, and thruſ ſhes: and that hyde them vnder the earth, as the ſnakes and badgers, and ſo many others?
            
            
               Go.
               This is not for knowinge the time, but by feling before, the differences therof: rather I wil ſay further to thee, that we not onelye knowe the time, but alſo not the mouinge of the heauen, which is his ſubiect, but we onely fele ye differences of the ſeaſons, that it cauſeth on earth, ſomtime bringing heat, & ſometime cold, ſometime winde, and ſometime raine, and ſuch naturall varieties. And theſe we knowe ſo muche before, & better then you, that you take often occaſions by vs, to pronoſticat: and knoweſt thou how this knowlege cō
                  meth to vs? becauſe we not hauing oure fantaſy ful of a thouſand toyes, as you alwayes

haue, fele euery little chaunge of tyme, the which is not ſo wyth you.
            
            
               Vli.
               But calleſt thou the knowing of time infelicitie?
            
            
               Go.
               Moſt great infelicitie, becauſe he (or to ſay better) ye mouing whervpon he is foūded, is the occaſion of euery chaunge, and finally that that is worſe, the occaſion of your corruption: whereby you that know it, ſe death alwaies before you, and you recken ye owres, one by one, and you ar euer thinking, on that, yt from time to time you ſhall haue nede of: the which is not ſo to vs, who liue by the benefit of nature: but what wilt thou more? your folye is ſo great, yt you take thought alſo for that that muſt folowe after your deathe.
            
            
               Vli.
               This is done to leaue all things ordeined in ſuch ſort, that our children, who are part of vs, may after leade their life ye more quietly.
            
            
               Go.
               Of theſe thinges yt are of weight, it ſhuld be a pleaſure: but you thinke alſo of thoſe that are of no weight.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what are thoſe?
            
            
               Go.
               Euen of your graue, and as thoughe the earthe were not the vniuerſal mother of all men and yt euery man had not his part therof, you bye it of your preſts, & he amōg you yt
                  
had no monye, ſhould be lefte in praye to vs beaſtes.
            
            
               Vli.
               I wyll not that we reaſon of this matter, for theſe thinges are ordeyned to the benefit of ſome one of vs, and they belonge not in generall to the kind.
            
            
               Go.
               Go to, let vs paſſe to the other, the whiche is, the feare that ye haue one of an other, the which thing is not among vs. For thou ſeeſt no beaſt of one kynde, that is naturallye enemye to the other of the ſame kynde, but by ſome chaunce, as by loue, hungar, geloſye, and ſuche lyke, and yet this very ſeldome.
            
            
               Vli.
               Neyther are we enemies naturally one to the other.
            
            
               Go.
               No, but the vnſacietie of your deſyres, hath turned it into nature.
               For that quantitie ſuffiſinge none of you, wherwith nature would be contented, the one of you ſeketh to take from the other that that he hath. And hereby ſo many warres growe amonge you, ſo manye deſolations of cities, ſo many robbynges of countries, ſo many ſlaughters of people, ſo manye treaſons, ſo manye theftes, and euen to poyſoning the one the other of you, a thinge that neuer any of vs was

ſene do.
            
            
               Vli.
               He that will, may well remedy all theſe thinges.
            
            
               Go.
               And after what ſort?
            
            
               Vli.
               By contenting him ſelfe with litle, and to liue of him ſelfe, ſeperate from others.
            
            
               Go.
               The fyrſte you may perchaunce do, but not the other, without your moſte great trouble. For you haue nede of ſo many thinges, that there is none, who of him ſelfe can prouide all thinges for him ſelfe, wherfore you muſt of neceſſitie dwell together with others. For the which thing cities were inuented by you, where you, dwelling comn
                     •
                  odiouſly together, might prouide the one for the others nede: and becauſe you might bringe this to the better ende, one not hauing alwaies nede, of thoſe thinges that an other hath, who hath nede of his, you alſo inuented mony, truely a moſte goodly meanes, and very conuenient for the commutation of thinges. But becauſe he bringeth ſo many commodities to your liuing, you loue it ſo farr out of order, that it is no leſſe occaſion of euill then it is of good, for by your continual ſeking thone to take it from thother.

ſo many miſchieues growe among you, that you can neuer practiſe one hower together ſafely, or without ſome ſuſpition.
            
            
               Vli
               I will not denie, that this making difference betwene thyne, and mine, is not the occaſion of many euils, and of much hatred, the which can not happen to you, who haue all thinges in common. Notwithſtanding, we againſt this haue frendſhippe among vs, wherof there can be nothing found in the world, either more profitable, or more pleaſaunt: by meanes werof we make common, not onely outwarde thinges, but alſo the thoughtes, the griefes, the felicities, and euery other thing.
            
            
               Go.
               Is there not alſo frendſhip among vs, & not only amongeſt thoſe of one like kinde, but alſo amongeſt thoſe of diuers kindes, as the turtle doues and the popingaye, the pecockes, and the pigion, the red dere & the falow, and many others?
            
            
               Vli.
               No: for true frendſhippe commeth of the good, and the honeſt: and you know neither thone nor thother. And therfore the frendſhippes that are among yll perſons, ordeined to ſome noughty pur

poſe, or that grow by profite, or beautie, rather are called practiſes, and co
                     •…
                  rations, then frendſhippes. So that yours are rather naturall inclinations. And beſydes this, frendſhip ſhould be voluntarye, and by election, the which thing you can not do.
            
            
               Go.
               And yet if true frendſhip be not amonges vs, neither is there flatterie, as there is amongeſt you: the which perchaunce hurteth no leſſe thē frendſhip helpeth.
            
            
               Vli.
               But we can know that, by the meanes of the diſcourſe of reaſon.
            
            
               Go.
               And by what meanes, ſins the flatterer is ſo like to the frend: and beſides this, flatterie pleaſing you ſo much, that it will not ſuffer you to perceiue the truth?
            
            
               Vli.
               Trulye, both for the pleaſure that it is to be praiſed, and for the ſelf nature of the thing it is no ſmalle difficultie to knowe who are flatterers, and who are true frendes, being as wel the duety of a true frend to pleaſe, as of a flatterer: ſauing yet that all flatterers in aduerſitie, forſake thee by and by, and frendes not (but it is a gret matter to know only that one is thy frend, when thou haſt nede of him: notwithſtanding,

be that conſidereth well, ſhal eaſely know him.
            
            
               Go.
               And whiche way, tell me I pray thee?
            
            
               Vli.
               There are many thinges, whereby a frende may be knowen from a flatterer, but theſe are the principall. The flatterer doeth alwaies accomodate him ſelfe, to the conditions of him that he flattereth: doynge as he doeth, and chaunging alſo as he chaungeth, and ſaying that, that is the very right way to liue: where as the frend alwaies foloweth his owne purpoſe, & doeth not accōmodate him ſelf to any other thing then to the good. Wherfore the flaterer is likenned to a ſhadowe, the which al? wayes foloweth the body, euer doyng as he doeth: and a frend in the light that ſhineth aboue all thinges, alwaies without ſpotting it ſelfe. Beſides this alſo, the flatterer prayſeth all that euer thou doeſt: and the frend onely that that is good. The flatterer in all doynges that are, or ſeme good, doth geue the chief place and excuſeth thee in vice, and bur
                     •
                  eneth him ſelfe: and finally, he neuer ſeketh any other thing, then to content others,

as well in ill, as in good: the whiche a frende neuer doth, who would not pleaſe thee, but in as much as honeſty requireth.
            
            
               Go.
               Wel, when al that thou ſaieſt were true, yet there is one other thinge, that doth cauſe me, that I will not in any wiſe retourne man, and that is this: the feare of the lawes, and of the puniſhmentes ordeined by them.
            
            
               Vli.
               Then doeſt thou thinke, that to haue lawes, is an euyll thinge to man?
            
            
               Go.
               No, but to haue nede of them is euill: for hereby the imperfection and weakenes of your nature is ſeene. Seeſt thou not that you haue ſo many immoderate deſyres, and agaynſt your owne wealth and profite, and you are ſo much ledd by them, that the light of reaſon is not ſufficient to teache you to auoide them: but you are enforced to make an infinite multitude of lawes, to drawe you from them by puniſhment, and by feare?
            
            
               Vli.
               Ye, this is to the ill ſorte, but the good, doing that that is conuenient for them, for vertues ſake, haue not onely no feare of the lawes, but alſo

alſo they knowe them not.
            
            
               Go.
               And howe many are there of theſe? could they be reckned without often repeting the beginning of the number? And if you were all ſo, what an vnquietnes brede in your mind, the continuall care and warenes, that you muſt haue in holding the bridell of reaſon to your ſences, that they cary you not out of the right path of the ſame.
            
            
               Vli
               This is made a cuſtome: and of accuſtomed thinges, (as thou knoweſt) there growe no paſſions at all.
            
            
               Go
               And what paynes muſt you ſuffer, before you haue made it, ſins you haue alwayes by nature, greateſt deſier of that that is moſt forbidden you? Where as to vs it happeneth not ſo, who hauing no deſier inconuenient to our nature, can auoyde them all, where and when it pleaſeth vs, without reſpect, or any feare, not onely of puniſhment, but alſo of ſhame, the which is among you a burden of no ſmall weight.
            
            
               Vli.
               Ye hoſt you then much hereof, for in very dede it is a thing worthy prayſe, not onely to haue no feare of the lawes, but alſo not to feare ſhame.
            
            
               Go.
               And what

faute haue we of this, ſins we knowe it not? So that let vs not talke of thoſe thinges that come not vnder our knowledge. Let this finally ſuffiſe thee, that the lybertie that I einoye in this ſtate, is ſo pleaſaunt to me (in reſpect of the multitude of bondages that you haue, of the greater part wherof, your folly, and ambition, are thoccaſions, that haue bounde your handes to many thinges wherevnto nature had ſet them at libertie) that not onely I will not retourne man, but alſo I will not practiſe amonge them. Knowing that you bynd not your ſelues onely to theſe your lawes, but alſo all thoſe beaſtes, of whom you are ſerued, and that liue familierly with you: for you haue ordeyned that they be kept, to ſatiſfye with theyr owne bodies, thoſe hurtes that they ſhould do to any other, blaming
                     •
                   them euen for theyr going to fede them in other mens fieldes: for the which thing you your ſelues ought to be puniſhed, for that you haue made thoſe thinges particuler, by the meanes of thyne and myne, that nature hadde geuen to you

in common. The which thing hath cauſed that you can not company ſafe togethers, as we do. And you are continually aferde, to loſe that that you haue, or to runne into ſome after myſchiefe. So that enioy thou this your ſtate ſo vnhappely, and full of ſo many miſeries, for I will ſpend that lytle life that auaunceth me, in this ſtate, without feare of death, or of anye other thing.

               ALthough truthe (as the prouerbe is) moſt deare Circes, ſeme oftē times to breede ſome hatred in the myndes of thoſe to whom it is ſpoken: yet I know that it ſo much diſpleaſeth a noble hart, to haue one thing in the mouth, and an other in the breſt, that I will take courage to ſpeake frelye, althoughe I ſhould perchaunce in ſome parte doute, to offende thee.
            
               Cir.
               Speake on frely, all that thou wilt, moſt worthye Vliſſes, for ther is nothing more frend to gentle myndes, then the trueth.
            
            
               Vli.
               I doute, that thou haſt not reſtored to them with whom I haue ſpoken, the power holely to diſcourſe, as thou haſt done the ſpeache, accordinge as thou promiſedſt me, I haue founde them ſo farre diſtaunt from the truthe: and yf thys were ſoo, I

                   that iudgeth it not better, to be a beaſt then a man, the whiche I would neuer beleue they would ſaye, yf they coulde vſe reaſon truelye.
            
            
               Cir.
               Truelye thou ſhouldeſt haue reaſon to thinke I had deceiued thee, yf I had ſo done. For thoſe thinges ſhould neuer be promiſed, that one eyther would not, or could not do: For thone cō
                  meth of noughtincs, and the other of foolyſhnes. And therfore knowe thou Vlyſſes, that whyles thou ſpakeſt with them, they had the ſelfe ſame knowledge, that they had whiles they were men.

               And howe do they then not knowe ſo manifeſt an errour, and chiefely ſins I haue ſo tolde them the truth?

               Our wiſe menne of

Gretia are wont to ſaye, that they, who can be counſailed by them ſelues, to liue well and honeſtly, are put in the firſt degre of vertue. And they that can not of them ſelues, but beleue the counſell of thoſe who are wiſer then they, are put in the ſecond degre: but he that can not of him ſelfe, nor yet will take counſell of others, is thought by them not worthy to be numbred among men. And of this ſort are they with whom I haue ſpoken: So that it is no maruaile, though they wyll not become men againe, but I, that haue more knowledge then they, knowinge that it is the very duetie of man to helpe others, ſhould not yet herefore ceaſe to ſeke to do this good, to thoſe that are worthy thereof. Yonder is a faire herd of dere I will ſe, if there be any Gretian among thē.

                  ged by Circes into an hynde.
            
            
               Vli.
               O▪ yf I haue to do with women, whoo as it is wonte to be ſaide, take alwaies the worſe parte, I ſhalbe euen al at one poynt. Notwithſtanding I ſhalbe far the better ſatiſfied to haue ſpoken with eche kinde.
            
            
               Hi.
               But what is thoccaſion Vliſſes, that thou goeſt thus ſekinge, yf here be anye Gretian? and tell me alſo yf thou canſt (as the gooddes alwaies helpe thee) howe it chaunceth that I vnderſtande thee, and can reaſon with thee, the whiche ſins I was an hynde, neuer chaūſed to me wyth any other.
            
            
               Vli.
               Acknowledge thankes to me for this, for I, by my requeſt, haue obtained of Circes, for the loue I deare to my Gretians, lycence to ſpeake wyth you all, and beſydes thys, to make all thoſe that wyll, to retourne into theyr former

ſtate, and to leade them with me to theyr owne country, and thou art one to whom I will do this benefite, yf thou wilte it. So that tell me thy mynde frelie: but heareſt thou? Se thou aunſwer me quickely: for you women, when you bethinke you ouer much on thinges, you drowne your ſelues therein, by the meanes of the lyttle diſcourſe and ſmale vnderſtandynge that you haue, whereby thoſe aunſwers are onely prayſed in you, yt you make quickelye.
            
            
               Hyn.
               No: loe there is a quicke aunſwere.
            
            
               Vli.
               But this ſhalbe none of the praiſed anſwers, though it be quicke.
            
            
               Hin.
               And whye ſo?
            
            
               Vli.
               Becauſe it is all out of reaſon.
            
            
               Hin.
               I will not that thou ſaye ſo Vliſſes, for I haue very good reaſon to ſaye no.
            
            
               Vlis.
               Then tell me why, or els I ſhoulde not thinke my ſelfe ſatiſfyed.
            
            
               Hin.
               Thynkeſt thou not that I haue reaſon, that I will not be reſtored into my former beinge, who (as I haue tolde thee) was a woman?
            
            
               Vli.
               No, for yet thou ſhouldeſt be a reaſonable creature: whoſe ſtate I ſee thou muche eſtemeſt, and thynkeſt better then the

ſtate of any beaſt, ſins thou thankedſt ſo muche the Goddes, for that 
                     •
                  thou haddeſt power to ſpeake againe, the whyche is onely appropriat to man.
            
            
               Hyn.
               Alas the being a reaſonable creature is not the cauſe that I will not returne into my former ſtate: but yt I muſt become a woman againe, as I haue told thee, for that women be ſo much deſpyſed by you, that ther haue bene of thoſe wiſe men among you, that haue bene bolde to affirme, that we are not of your kinde, and others haue ſaid, that the female is a male occaſioned: the which meaneth nothing els, then a thinge made by nature, contrarye to her purpoſe, eyther for imperfectiō of the ſede or for defaulte of the matter. The whiche thing how far it is contrarye to the very order of nature, may well be manifeſt to euery man, for that we alſo are as neceſſary to your generation, as your ſelues: and afterwarde that thynge, that is borne of vs▪ is able to engender the like to it ſelfe: the whiche they that are borne of two diuorſe kindes can not do: as may be ſene by experience in Mules, who are borne of

an horſe and an Aſſe.
            
            
               Vli.
               Haſt thou ſo muche philoſophye?
            
            
               Hy.
               Maruell not therat Vliſſes, for my huſbande was an excellente philoſopher, wherby I alſo was enforced, keping conuerſation wyth him, to lerne ſomwhat therof
                     •
                  and beſides this thou knoweſt, that philoſophye is to manne almoſt naturall.
            
            
               Vli.
               And yet haſt thou not knowē how to remedy one of the principall defectes, that the being a woman bringeth with it?
            
            
               Hy.
               Why what is that?
            
            
               Vli.
               The deſyre to chatter, that can do ſo much in thee, that thou deſireſt not to return into a woman, but only to haue the talking again, thanking, as thou diddeſt euen nowe, the Goddes, for that thou haddeſt the power a gaine to ſpeake.
            
            
               Hi.
               And thinkeſt thou not that I haue reaſon therof, ſins you kepe women for ſlaues, and for ſeruantes and not for cōpanions (as right requireth) a thing ſo wicked and ſo far againſt the order of nature, that none other be aſked but you, dar do it? Seke a litle amōg what kind of beſtes thou wilt, and yu ſhalt find amōg none but yt ye femal is a cōpaniō & no

ſeruaunt to the male, aſwell in pleaſures as in paines, except in the kynd of man▪ who wil be called Lord ouer all, whereas he is a moſt euill and an vniuſt tyraunt, to handle his companion in ſuch ſorte, onelye for that he ſeeth ſhe was made by nature ſomwhat of leſſe ſtrength and corage then he was.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what doo we to you, that you haue ſo greate cauſe to complayne.
            
            
               Hy.
               Heareſt thou it not? fyrſt you kepe vs for your bound ſeruantes.
            
            
               Vli.
               Oh, ſaye not ſo, for thou doeſt vs wronge: but ſay for companions, and thou ſhalte ſay well.
            
            
               Hy.
               Is ſhe called a companion, where the one is alwayes bounde, and the other a mayſter: and peraduenture (the which is worſe) we muſte not bye this bondage by weyght of gold? ſins you haue founde thys goodlye lawe that when one of vs will companie wyth you, (to ſaye after your owne mindes) ſhe muſt geue you money.
            
            
               Vli.
               We inuented thys onelye for your profitte.
            
            
               Hy.
               Judge it thou, whether to paye them that commaunde vs, be for our profit, where others paye them that obeye them. But

tel me after what ſort this cuſtome was brought in by you for our profite?
            
            
               Vli.
               Becauſe knowing that through your lyttle ſpirite and ſmall wiſedome, you coulde not kepe your ſubſtaunce, it was thought that the ſame parte of ryches, that your fathers or brothers geue you, ſhould be geuen by you to your huſbands, not becauſe they be mayſters therof, but as your takers hede thereof, they kepe it for you, becauſe you at any time remaininge ſole, may haue wherwith to liue. And marke how after theyr deathes, you may alwaies aſke it: the whiche is cleane contrary to that that thou layeſt, for it is all to the hurt of your huſbandes, and of theyr ſubſtaunce. And it ſhould be rather vſed, and ſo right would, that the huſband when he marieth a wife, ſhould on thother part bring as much money with him, as the wife geueth her for his ioynter, and after they ſhould both ſpend in cōmon, as longe as it laſted, and then euery one prouide for him ſelf. For in dede it is not very good for vs, that we attend alwaies to get abrode, and you to conſume at home. And then

at our death, deſtruction and ſpoyle to be made onely of our goodes
            
            
               Hi.
               Our gaynes in the houſe are farr greater Vliſſes, then yours abrode: and to proue this true, thou ſhalt neuer ſee any gather together great quantitie of riches, if he haue not a womā in the houſe, that kepeth and ſeeth well to that, that he hath gathered together.
            
            
               Vli.
               I beleue this, and in this I thinke well that you are much better then we. For by your ſmale hart, you are by nature much more houſhold ſeruauntes then we: but then if you muſt take care onely, of that that we gather, then it belōgeth more to you to obey then to commaunde. For in as much as your witte is occupied, and vigilaunt about ſmall thinges, in ſo much is it vnmete to gouerne great thinges. And therfore it is ſayde, that women neuer deſerue ſo much to be prayſed for any thing, as for obedience.
            
            
               Hi.
               This is a thing that you ſay, becauſe it is good for your purpoſe: but aſke of vs a litle, and if this ſuffiſe you not, aſke experience, and you ſhal ſe whether we be mete to gouern gret things or not. Marke

the kingedome of the Amaſones, howe long time it was gouerned by womē, and conſider if they haue bene able to enlarge it without your wit and ſtrength? Of the kingdome of Babilonia, ſo much enlarged by Semiramis: and of the deminion of Seithia by Tomiris, I will ſpeake nothing at all, for that your owne ſtories be full therof.
            
            
               Vli.
               And howe many ſhal they be, that are able to like thinges? could they be reckened with the ſyngers of one onely hande?
            
            
               Hi.
               Thankes be to you, who geue them none occaſion therof: but alwaies you kepe them faſt ſhette within the walles of your houſes, occupied in the mooſt vyle buſineſſes, that are neceſſarye to the ſeruauntes charge: vſyng to ſaye, that that woman onely deſerueth to be prayſed, whoſe dedes and prayſes, go not forth of the walles of her houſe. Notwithſtandinge, yf you marke well, you ſhall knowe alſo of them, in theſe ſo baſe and ſeruyle buſines, ſuch extreme diligence, that thoſe houſes wher women dwel not, & that ar not gouerned by women, ſeme in

reſpect of the others, like hogge ſties, and not a paradiſe, as ſome of you heretofore haue had hert to ſaye. I will ſay nothing at all of the gouernement of your bodies, becauſe the apparaunce it ſelfe, the apparell, and many other thinges, cauſe thoſe men to be manifeſtlye knowen, who are gouerned by women, from thothers.
            
            
               Vli.
               Truely in theſe thinges you can do very well.
            
            
               Hi.
               We ſhall alſo do euen as well in greater thinges, yf you would ſuffer vs to put our handes therto.
            
            
               Vli.
               Well, go no further, leaſte it chaunce to you, as it dyd to a certayne ſhomaker, who fyndinge fault with an ymage for hauing the buckle of his ſhoe amyſſe, and beyng prayſed therfore, toke courage to diſprayſe him in certayne other places: whereby it was ſayde to him: hold thy peace, for this belongeth not to thee.
            
            
               Hi.
               And yet at the leaſt, with all this, I would we might pleaſe you. But you neuer do any other thing then lament you of vs, nor yet can we neuer haue good worde of you.
            
            
               Vli.
               I will not that thou ſay thus: for we alwayes

honoure you much more then our owne ſelues.
            
            
               Hi.
               Not with geuinge vs any rule or aucthoritie at all, eyther in the houſe, or abrode: but with ſettinge vs at the higheſt place of the takle, or with ſome louing woorde, and this onelye in the flower of our age, by the occaſyon of our beautie, that draw
                     •
                  th your deſyres to pleaſe vs: but when the beauty is paſte, God knoweth howe we are handeled at your handes, both with wordes and dedes.
            
            
               Vli.
               Ah, lay not ſo: for this ſhould be to great vnkindnes.
            
            
               Hi.
               I will not ſpeake of dedes, for not publiſhinge of that that euery man knoweth not ſo well. But howe can you excuſe your ſelues of words, ſins you haue made for a prouerbe, that a huſband hath onely two good dayes of his wife, that is, the daye that ſhe commeth to his houſe, and thother is, when ſhe goeth out thereof, borne to her graue?
            
            
               Vli.
               Thoſe are thinges that men ſometimes ſpeake merely one to an other, and to paſſe ouer the troubles of the world, but they thinke not ſo in dede. And that this is true: ſee howe the

moſt parte, or rather all men, take wines and I will ſay further to thee, that they that take none, are alwaies taken for ſtraunge mē, and of a life of ſmall praiſe.
            
            
               Hi.
               And what, vſe you not alſo to ſay, that he who hath had a wife, deſerueth a crowne of pacience, but he that hath had twaine; deſerueth a crowne of folly.
            
            
               Vli.
               This was not ſaide without ſome occaſion. For the ſecond mariages, and chiefely to them that haue children, are for the more parte, greater occaſions of euill, then of good. And they ſeldome tyme haue that knot of loue, that ye firſte haue. And alſo in keping you companye, pacience is very neceſſary, for you are all by nature ſomewhat vngracious, ſo that one of our wiſe men was wont to ſay, that when a woman went to her huſbād, ſhe caried one of her handes before, and therein a litle fyre brand a light, meaninge thereby that ſhe put fyre in
                     •
                  o the houſe wherein ſhe entred.
            
            
               Hi.
               Nay, be not aſhamed to ſay the reſte alſo, howe he ſaid that ſhe caried in the hande behinde a hoke, to robbe the houſe, whereof ſhe

went out.
            
            
               Vli.
               I will not denye that ſome of theſe thinges haue not bene ſayde by ſome of thoſe, whom we haue called wiſe men, and the frowarde nature of ſome of you, hath bene thoccaſion therof: nor I will not alſo denye the ſtraungenes that ſome of vs ſomtimes vſeth towardes you, they I ſay that are nought and of litle knowledge: for they knowe not howe profitable you are vnto vs, and with how many incommodities, and troubles, we ſhould leade our life without your helpe: But I will euen confeſſe vnto thee, that we are without you a thinge imperfecte: wherefore we oughte alwaies to make much of you, and haue the ſame eſtimation of you, that we haue of our ſelues. And he that doeth otherwiſe, deſerueth not to be called a man. And although it appere vnto vs, that nature hath made you of leſſe valor then vs, we ſhould yet conſider that ſhe hath done it for our benefite. For yt you were of that valor, and of that wit that we are, you would not take paynes, in thoſe thinges that you do, in ſeruing vs wherof the profite commeth to be ours, of

the which we are no leſſe bound vnto you thē vnto nature, for geuing vs the being. So that let it not greue you, if ſome one haue ſpoken vnaduiſedly of you, that that thou ſaieſt, for they are many moo, that haue prayſed you, and worthely. For there hath bene no lacke of thoſe, that haue ſayd, that we ſhould liue ſo miſerably without you, that it ſhould be better to dye, and that you are our crowne: As that moſt wiſe king of Egypt did, who willing to ſhewe his riches, to an other king, at the laſt for the moſt noble thing he had, he ſhewed him his wife, ſaying that there coulde not be founde by any man, a more precious 
                     •
                  ewell, then a wiſe woman.
            
            
               Hi.
               And if it be ſo how chaunſeth it then, that we be ſo euill handled by you?
            
            
               Vli.
               And what would you in thende that we ſhould do?
            
            
               Hi.
               Haue I not told thee alredy, that you ſhould kepe vs for companions, and not for ſeruants? Tell me I pray thee what right is this, that you haue taken for a cuſtome, that it is lawfull for you, to do as you liſte, and not for vs, brideling vs with the daunger

of our honeſties? why doo not you aſwell alſo diſhoneſt a familye, when you geue place ſo loſely to your appetites, as you ſay that we do, who are muche more prouoked therto thē you are, not ſo much by that moſt burning deſyre, that the forbydding vs a thyng cauſeth, as by your inſatiable and curſed importunitie? And then yf you haue taken ons our honeſties from vs, do you not thinke vs worthye of all blame?
            
            
               Vli.
               Why do ye not keepe it then more diligently then you do?
            
            
               Hi.
               Howe ſhoulde it be poſſible for vs to kepe it, when euery one of you hath a keye thereof? So that blame your ſelues and lay the faut one your ſelues, whē you ſee any of vs loſe our honeſty. And by ſoo much the more, as you ſay you are of greter braine and more wiſedome then we,
            
            
               Vli.
               Yf thou diddeſt well conſider, the cauſe that moueth vs to do this, thou woldeſt ſaye it were reaſonablye done. But thou meaſureſt your beinge with oures, and hereby groweth the errour. Tell m
                     •
                   a litle, doſt thou thinke it reaſonable that a man ſhuld leue thoſe goodes, and thoſe

honors that he hath gotten, with his trauayle, and his wiſedome, to one that is not his childe?
            
            
               Hy.
               No truelye.
            
            
               Vli.
               And howe ſhould he be by any meanes aſſured that the childe were his, if it were lawfull for you to do your deſires? the which thing maketh no matter at all to you beaſtes, who make onely ſo much accompt of them, as is neceſſarye for them. And when they are brought to that paſſe, that they liue of them ſelues, you knowe them no more.
            
            
               Hin.
               And in this thyng of chyldren alſo, what company is youres, and what righte, or what equitie is there amonge you, that whiles they are little, and of moſt great trouble (for thou knoweſt howe great a paine it is to bring vp a man) you leaue them holely vnder our charge, and you will heare of no trouble at all: the which thing is geuen to none other beaſt, then to you?
            
            
               Vli.
               And you peraduenture canne not geue them to nurſe to auoyde your ſelues of them, wherby they are very litle bound to you, none other creature but you vſing the ſame?
            
            
               Hi.
               And whoo is the cauſe

thereof but you, that will not onely ſometimes not heare them crye, but alſo wyll not take with them any moſt litle troble? And after when they are bygge, both you and they together agre to make none accompte of vs at all, and not only in dedes but alſo in wordes, ſins they are called only your children, and of you they take their name, their familye, and all that euer they haue without making any mē
                  tion of vs at all.
            
            
               Vli.
               This is not done without moſt great conſideration.
            
            
               Hi.
               And what is the cauſe, but your aucthoritie, as in all other thinges, that for being more able then we, you make your reaſon as your ſelues liſt.
            
            
               Vli.
               The cauſe is for that they haue the ſenſitiue ſubſtaunce, and the being man, onely of vs.
            
            
               Hi.
               And ſerue we there then for nothing?
            
            
               Vli.
               No not in this, becauſe thou muſt perceyue, that the female, of her ſelf can not giue two thinges, that are engendred by her, but the vegitatiue ſubſtaunce the which is that ye tres haue: nor cā bring thē to any greater perfection, without the male. And therfore nature that doeth nothing

in vaine, made not the male and female amonge plantes. But if ſhe did make in any, as for example in the Cor
                  
                     ••
                  oll, (the which bereth beries like a haw) the female onely beareth fruite, and the male is barren, & it nedeth not that they ioine together, ſins that that is engendred by them, ſhall not haue, but the vegetatiue ſubſtaunce, the whiche the female alone may geue. And yt this is true, marke it in hennes, who of them ſelues make the egge, the whiche hath the vegitatiue ſubſtaunce, after that he waxeth to a certaine determinate quantetye: but the beaſt can not be made by them, the which hath the ſentitiue ſubſtaunce yf they couple not with the cocke, that he maye geue it them. And alſo you women ſometimes engender of your ſelues, in the mattrice, a pece of fleſhe, called by Phiſitions, Mola, the whiche for that it hath the vegitatiue ſubſtaunce, groweth to a certaine point, but it perceyueth not for that it hath not the ſenſitiue ſubſtaūce for this (as I haue told thee) the male gyueth. Then yf our chyldren haue their

animate being of the ſenſitiue ſubſtance, and finally the being men, onely by vs, they are worthely called oures: and for this only cauſe, you are permitted to leue them when you liſt, and we cannot.
            
            
               Hi.
               And what reward ſhall we haue for our painfull bringing them vppe?
            
            
               Vli.
               That that women continually haue, that is, to be alwaies honored, and mainteined by them, yf you forſake them not: for almooſt all children doe this: and whoe that doeth it not, is vnworthy to be called a man. But nature, becauſe they ſhould not faile hereof, hath put into them a certaine inclination of loue, towardes the mothers, that it ſemeth that the greater parte, loue them more tenderly then they do the fathers.
            
            
               Hi.
               As though we loued not out of meaſure, bothe them, and alſo our huſbandes: ye rather there haue bene of thoſe amonge vs, who heryng of the death of ther children, haue died ſodenly, and others who ſeing their huſbandes dye, haue killed theym ſelues with their owne handes: iudging that it was vnto them, neither lawfull to liue withoute

a man, nor honeſt to accompanye them ſelues with mo then one.
            
            
               Vli.
               Theſe are thinges, that althoughe they ſeme at ye firſt ſight to deſerue ſome praiſe for yt they ſeme to procede of loue, or by ſtoutnes of minde: come rather euen of foliſhnes, or of weakenes of hart, by doutinge not to be able to lyue alone: for yf nature, who euer doth the beſt in al thinges, had knowen, that it had bene beſte, that the wife and the huſband ſhoulde dye at one tyme, ſhe ſhoulde haue cauſed that it ſhould haue ben ſo. But let vs let theſe ſo longe diſcourſes go: wylte thou returne into thy former being, and come with me into Gretia?
            
            
               Hi.
               No I ſaye, for I will not become a woman againe in no caſe? for thou myghteſt well haue perceiued, whether the occaſions that I haue tolde were reaſonable or not.
            
            
               Vli.
               And becauſe they ſeme not ſo vnto me, I aſke thee it againe.
            
            
               Hi.
               Thou maiſt talke of it at pleſure, for it toucheth the nothing at all: I am thus an Hynde, of as much aucthoritie at the leaſt as the male, & I go abrode as he doeth: Neither

yet haue I ſo many ſorowes in the delyueraunce of my younge, nor ſo manye troubles in bringing of them vp, as I ſhould haue of my children, being a woman.
            
            
               Vli.
               Very well ſaid: as thoughe you alſo haue no troubles and griefes at your deliueraunces: and haue you not nede alſo to pourge you as our women haue?
            
            
               Hi.
               Ye, but nature hath geuen vs ſuch ſtrength, that we can do it of our ſelues: and ſo much knowledge, that we eate of a certaine herbe called Ara, the which reſtoreth vs to health at the firſte.
            
            
               Vli.
               And haue not you alſo troubles in bringing vppe of your younge, aſwel as we haue in bringing vp of oures?
            
            
               Hi.
               Moſt fewe in compariſon of you: for they hauing nede of farre fewer thinges then yours, muſt nedes geue vs leſſe troubles, and thoſe fewe being prouoked by a cer? tame naturall inſtinction, that gideth vs in all our doinges, ſeme to vs nothinge harde at all: wheras to you, who are not guided ſo cōtinually by nature, they ſeme more grenous. So yt labor no more Vliſſes in cōforting me to become a womā again for I

liue far better contented, and more frelye thus a Hinde, then I did whiles I was a woman. But I ſaye vnto thee, that if I ſhould chaunge my ſtate, I wold more willinglye become a humaine creature againe, then chaunge me into any other beaſte. And of thys thou mayeſt be ſure, for when I muſt faune, I fle more the pathes made by beaſtes, then the waies beten by mennes feete. Go then thy waies on thy vyage, and I likewiſe will go to conſume the reſt of my life, among theſe woodes: for now ſins I haue had power to ſpeake againe, wythout returning vnto a woman, I beare not only no enuye to the Goddes, but alſo not vnto men.
            
            
               Vli.
               I will not Hynde that thou ſtand ſo much in this thine opinion, but that thou conſider, that men vnderſtande more then you, and that I geue thee this counſell onely for thyne owne profit, and for the loue that I beare the, for that thou arte of my Gretia, and for no profit of mine at all.
            
            
               Hy.
               You ſay alwaies thus whiles we haue conuerſation with you, and yet notwithſtandinge you kepe vs

alwaies vnder.
            
            
               Vli.
               Beſides this thou ſhalt vnderſtand, that Cyrces hath geuen thee power to ſpeake, only becauſe thou maieſt ſaye thy minde: for ſhe will not that I cauſe any to take theyr former ſhape agayne, ſauinge they onely that will. So that if thou wilt remaine thus in an Hind thou ſhalte haue noo power to ſpeake any more, the which thinge, as thou diddeſt ſhewe, thou very much eſtemedſt.
            
            
               Hi.
               If I beleued that this were true, I can not well tell what I would do.
            
            
               Vli.
               Oh ſhouldeſt thou doubt hereof, and knoweſt that Deare ſpeake not?
            
            
               Hi.
               But what matter is that: ſins I alſo muſt be conuerſaunt onely with Deare, and we haue other meanes to ſhewe our neceſſities one to an other, the which are ſo fewe, and ſo rare, that they trouble vs little. So that ſeke ſome other Vlyſſes for I for my part wil remaine in this ſtate.
            
         
         
            
            The ſyxt Dialogue. Vlyſſes, the Lyon.
            
               I Knowe not what the cauſe may be, that nature (who men ſaye can not erre) hath made the female ſo farr different from the male, onely in the humaine kinde. Yf I looke among fowles, the one is of as muche valoure as the other, or els of ſo lytle leſſe, that it is almooſt not knowen: and all men may ſee, that the female in coueringe the egges, or in bringing vp of the younge, will not take any moore paynes at all, then the male. As it is alſo among the beaſtes of the earthe, and in thoſe that liue in the waters: for that the female (as I ſayd) is of as great vertue, and of as much force as the male. But in the humayne kynde, the woman is of ſo muche leſſe valoure, and of ſo much leſſe ſtrength, then the man, that thoſe vertues

that are in him, eyther they are not in her, or els they are ſo imperfecte there, that they are ſcar
                  •
               ely perceyued to be in her. Let them then complayne of nature, that hath made them ſo, and let them not complayne of vs, yf it ſeeme to them rather to be our ſeruauntes, then our companions: for this commeth nether by our force, nor by tyranny, but of theyr lytle valour, and ſpirite. Wherby, fearinge that they coulde not knowe, or be able to lyue without vs, they bringe theym ſelues vnder our obedience, remayninge willinglye vnder that yoke: where as yf they were of lyke nobleneſſe of mynde, or of lyke ſtrengthe as we are, we ſhoulde neuer be able to kepe them by force. Therfore it is not to be marueyled at, yf ſhe with whom I ſpake, wyll not from an Hinde, retourne to an humaine creature, ſynce ſhe muſte becomme a woman agayne: Becauſe, that where thus an Hynde, ſhe lyueth in libertie, a thinge ſo pleaſaunte, as none other thynge is more, ſhe ſhoulde beynge a woman, becomme a ſeruaunte: none other thing
                  •
               
               
in all the worlde more greuous to hym, who is a man in dede. Let me then ſeke, yf I canne do this benefite, to ſuche as it maye do good, ſince it ſhould do hurt to her. And peraduenture there maye be ſome one amongeſt theſe Liones that I ſee come towardes me. But what doo I? Who knoweth, troublinge them, whether they will hurte me, or not: the which they would not do, yf I diſturbe theim not, yf they be not prouoked thereunto by hunger? And althogh Cyrces hath tolde me, that I ſhould haue no feare of any beaſt, that is within thys her Iſland: I can not yet but haue ſome feare of theſe, theyr countenaunce is ſo horrible, and fearefull. Notwithſtanding knowing the loue that ſhe beareth me, I will truſt to her wordes, and go boldelye towardes them. Lyons (as nature kepe you withoute anye trouble, in thys your kynde, or he that can chaunge you into that that you moſt deſyre) tell me is here anye of you, who, whiles he was man, was a Gretian? lette him tell it me gentelly. For yf he deſyre (as he ſhould

do,) to become manne againe, and to retourne into his countrey, he hath thys daye (thanked be loue) chaunced on one, that maye doo for him both the one and the other.
            
               Li.
               I was a Gretian, as thou alſo ſhouldeſt be, yf the ſpeach that thou ſpeakeſt be naturall to thee.
            
            
               Vli.
               Yea, I am alſo a Gretian, and my name is Vliſſes, yf thou euer hearde thereof whiles thou were a man.
            
            
               Li.
               Yea, verye often: and not onelye whiles I was in Grecia, but afterwardes alſo in many other places as I ſayled. But tell me, haſte thou lefte the arte of warre, by the whiche I thinke thy name be ſpredde not onelye thoroughe Gretia, but thoroughe all the worlde, that thou art ſo here arryued? eyther els hathe fortune dryuen thee hither, as ſhe didde me?
            
            
               Vli.
               Not fortune, but deſyre to ſee the worlde. For our Gretia hauing ouercome all thoſe people, who were enemies thereunto, and I, not knowing what thing more to do, to gette me honour, gaue my ſelfe to ſaylynge.
            
            
               Li.
               And lyueth yet thy Penelope, whoſe honeſtye

was an example of all our Gretia?
            
            
               Vli.
               She liueth, and the deſier that I haue to ſee her agayne, together with deſier to ſee my frendes, and my countrey, ſtyrreth me ſo much, that I haue aſked lycence of Cyrces, (of whom I am peraduenture no leſſe beloued then of her) to retourne into my countrey: and for the loue that I bere to my Gretians, to make all thoſe to retourne men, that will, and to carye them with me. And this is the occaſion that I aſked yf there were any Gretian amongeſt you: and I am glad that I haue found thee, to geue thee ſo fayre a gyfte.
            
            
               Li.
               Although ſometimes it chaunce, that one deſyring to doo thee a pleaſure, doo offend thee, yet ſhouldeſt thou thinke thy ſelfe not a lytle bound vnto him, hauing reſpect to the goodnes of his minde, and not to his little knowledge: for of the one the will ſhould be praiſed, and of the other nature blamed. And ſo do I to the Ʋliſſes, thankinge thee of the good mynde that thou haſt towardes me, but the gifte I will not accept: for where thou thynkeſt

it ſhoulde be profitable and deare vnto me, it ſhould be noyſome and to my great diſpleaſure.
            
            
               ¶Vli.
               And why ſo? is it then better to be a beaſt then a man?
            
            
               Li.
               Ye truely: and that this is true, aſke of that our wiſe Gretian, who was commonly wont to ſaye: that if man mought be ſene well within, it ſhould eaſelye be knowen, that he were euen a veſſell, and a ſtore houſe, made by nature, to laye vp therein all his euilles.
            
            
               Vli.
               He ought herefore to blame him ſelfe, muche more then nature: for oftentimes, by ouermuche folowinge his appetite, he deſtroyeth his complexion in ſuche ſorte, that he him ſelfe is the cauſe of all his hurtes.
            
            
               Li.
               I ſpeake not of euyles of the body Ʋlyſſes, I ſpeake of them of the mynde, who are farre more weighty and more daungerous.
            
            
               Vli.
               Nay I will not that thou ſaye this, ſo reſolutely.
               For this our bodye beynge none other thinge, then a wagan that carieth our ſoule, yf he be feable and weake: the ſoule canne not doo perfectlye her

operatiōs, or els with very gret difficultie.
            
            
               Li.
               I will not deny, that the vnapte diſpoſitions of the body let not the operatiōs of the mynd: But I ſaye verely, that the infirmities of the mynd, do much more hurt to man, then thoſe of the bodie do: and that there come many mo euils, and daungers of the one then of thother. But why labour I in this? who ſhal he be that can ſay, that they are not farre worſe and more greuous, being in the beſt part, and moſt noble of man?
            
            
               Vli.
               I knowe well that the mynd is more noble then the body, notwithſtanding, not being able to worke without the body, euen ſo hurteth the euill of the one, as of the other.
            
            
               Li.
               Wilt thou ſee Ʋlyſſes, that the euils of the body are farre leſſe daungerous thē thoſe of the mind? for man eyther by the yll colour of the face, or by thinordinate mouing of the pulſes, or by wekenes, or by a thouſand other meanes knoweth thē all, and ſeketh ſtreight to be holpen therof: where as thoſe of the mynde, deceiue vs very often times, ſoo much, that not

onely we ſeke not to be fre therof, but we accoumpte theym good, whereby afterwarde groweth our miſery, and continuall vnquietnes: and often times the loſſe of our countrye, of our frendes and children, of goodes, and honeſtie, and a thouſand other miſchiefes. Where as by them of the bodie the worſt that can come thereof is death, the which muſt come in anye wiſe. But what needeth anye more? yf among the euils of the body, you recken thoſe the worſe that take from the patient the ſenſe and knowledge, as the letharge the franzie, the fawlling ſickenes, and ſuch lyke: And if thoſe of the minde do in ſuch ſort, that he who hath them, knoweth them not: are not they then to be accompted moſt greuous?
            
            
               Vli.
               Truely this ſayinge is moſt true.
            
            
               Li.
               Thou knoweſt that to be ſicke ſometimes, is graunted by the Phiſitions to be no great euill, for that nature ſo requireth. But yet not ſo much, that manne knowe not, that he is not in health, and hath not nede to be holpen: for the knowinge to haue nede of remedie, is a very good ſigne in ye
                  
paciente, that he ſhall recouer his health. And thys can not be done in the euilles of the minde: for he who by them is greued, can make no right iudgemēt of himſelfe, the euil being in that parte, to the which the iudgement thereof apperteyneth. And for thys cauſe, foliſhnes is the greteſt euill that can chaunce to man. For aſmuch as he that hath it, neuer knoeth it: and knowing it not, neuer ſeketh alſo if he may find any remedy to vnburden him ſelfe thereof.

               This ſelfe ſame thing chaunſeth properly to dronkerdes, who till thoſe fumes of the wyne be ſetled, that let the places wher thinner ſenſes muſt worke their operations, knoing not their dronkennes, whereby they thinkinge to do well, do a thouſand thinges worthy blame.
            
            
               Li.
               Dronkennes is none other thing then a kind of folly: But where as in this, thoſe organnes, where the knowledge is made, are marred for a time, by the meanes of the wine, in that other they are moſt commonlye marred for euer. But what more greater

ſigne wilte thou, that the euilles of the mynde are more greuous, then thoſe of ye body, then that yu ſhalt neuer find any, ſpeking of theſe of ye body, cal an ague helth, nor the hauing ye tiſicke, good ſoundnes, nor the gout, good diſpoſition of ye wintes: and in thoſe of the mind, thou ſhalte find many, that call anger ſtoutnes, wanton loue, frendſhip: enuy, emulation: and ferefulnes, diligence? Whereby it commeth, that thoſe ſeke and loue the Phiſition, and theſe flye and hate the rebuker.
            
            
               Vli.
               Of howe much euill is this couering of vices with the cloke of vertue, thoccaſion in this worlde? and wyth a name worthy of honor, to do thoſe thynges, that deſerue none other thynge then blame and diſpraiſe.
            
            
               Li.
               And put alſo to this, that he who is troubled wyth any infirmitie of the bodye, goeth moſt commonly to bed, where he findeth, whyles he gouerneth him ſelfe, ſome reſt, and alſo ſome time, to auoide the griefe of the euill: yf he toſſe aboute in the bed, or moue to much, he hath about him yt couereth him again, & ceſeth not to bid him lye

as ſtil as he may: But he that is ſicke in ye mind, neuer findeth quiet, or any reſt at all, but rather he lyueth in a continuall trouble, and hath none that geueth him any contentation or helpe: whereby euen as to them that ſaile, that tempeſte that ſuffereth them not to take the hauen is farre worſe, then that that letteth the ſailinge: So alſo the euils of the mynde, neuer permitting him to take the hauen of reaſon, and to anker in the ſame, that is troubled with them, are muche worſe. Finally if thou wilt plainely knowe, howe farre they of the minde are worſe, conſider that he, who is ſubiecte to thoſe of the bodie, ſuffereth onely the euill: but he that is ſubiecte to thoſe of the mind, ſuffereth not onely the euil, but he doth it alſo.

               Seke the occaſion of all the variaunces, and calamities that chaunce in the worlde, and thou ſhalt ſee it. For thou ſhalte knowe that they come of none other thing, then of ambition, enuy, auarice, anger, or of lyke infirmities

of the mind of man, the which beſides the taking the vſe of reaſon from him, trouble him continuallye ſo muche, that he neuer ſuffereth either him ſelf, or others in quiet, and one of this ſorte only is ſufficient to trouble a whole citie, and chiefely yf he be of any degre or authoritie at all.

The which is farre more manifeſtly ſeene, when you take vs, who abyde paciently hunger and thyrſt: yea manye of vs ſuffer oure ſelues to dye, then to remayne with you: willingly preferring death before bondage.
               Wherfore you are enforced, when you will make any of vs tame, to take of our little younglinges, who not knowinge what they do, ſuffering you to fede them familiarly by your vayne intiſementes, loſe at one time, with theyr libertie, the ſame ſtrength of mynd, and ſuſtines of bodye (craftely ſo taken from theym by you) that appertayne vnto theyr kynde.

               It is true that there are euilles, of the whiche a fortiall man ſhoulde be

afearde (but yet therfore not of all.) For there are of thoſe, that he, who woulde haue no feare of them, ſhould be a foole, and ſhould deſerue blame: as for example, infamye, pouertie, and ſutche like. Beſides this yet, one ſhould feare nothing (how horrible or euill ſo euer it appeared to be) for cauſe of the good, and the honeſt. And therfore he is called mooſte fortiall that feareth not deathe, the whiche is mooſte horrible of all, for that it is thende of lyfe. Notwithſtandinge, this maketh not, that euery kynde of death muſt not be feared. Nor the hauing feare of the naturall death, or of that that chaunſeth by fortune in the ſea, or by other like occaſions, maketh not that man can not bee fortiall. Then ſhall he be fortiall, that ſhall not feare ſutche death, as ſhall be mooſte honourable: as that is that chaunſeth in the warres, for honeſt occaſion, or for defence of the countrey: the whiche death is ſo fayre, that the people haue ordeyned perticuler honoures to all thoſe, that dye by lyke deathe.

For to auoide thinges painefull, or to chooſe deathe to flye ſome miſerie, or ſome euyll, and not for beyng an honeſt thinge, commeth of lacke of harte, and corage, and not of fortitude.

               And therfore you are bolde and not fortiall. For among horrible thinges, there are alſo of thoſe that he who feareth them, can not be ſayd for this that he is not fortiall, as all thoſe thinges are that paſſe the might of man: as for example, the erth quakes, the thunder belt, and ſuch like: the which are yet ſuffred alſo by the mighty, with a more ſtedfaſt mynde, then the others commonly do. But euen as the feare of euery thing when there is no nede, is a vyce called fearefulnes, ſo alſo the not hauinge feare of any thinge, when, and as it behoueth, the which is thother extremitie, is a vyce called raſhe boldenes: in the middes of the whiche two extremes (for vyces are none other then extremes, that offende eyther in to lyttle

                  , or to muche) fortitude is put by reaſon, and therfore thou ſhalte ſee that fortiall men will neuer put them ſelues in any daunger, without ſome reaſon: for it ſhould be to great a follye to venture the lyfe, the whiche is the deareſt thynge that manne hathe, but for ſome honeſt enterpryſe: and

they ought much more to do it, that are moſt wiſe, as thoſe that are moſt worthye to line, for that they are mooſte apte to helpe others. Wherfore this name of fortitude is not alſo geuen amonge vs, to them that put theyr liues in daungers of warre for money, but onely to him that doeth it, eyther to defende his countrey, or for his owne honeſtie, or for lyke honeſt enterpriſes: neyther are they alſo called fortiall, but lecherous, and coueteous, who either for unmoderate deſier of pleſures, or of loue, or to poſſeſſe riches, eſteme no daunger. Soo alſo they that do it for anger, or for ignoraunce, are called by vs

                  refull and raſhe. Finallye he is onely fortiall that feareth not death, either for winning of honeſty, or for the auoyding of ſoone diſhoneſt thing: the which thinge can not be in you, for that you haue not reaſon (as I tolde thee before) that may geue right iudgemente therof.

               I knowe well that thou arte a beaſt, that canneſt do very well without the gouernaunce and

nor flyeth thoſe to muche that bringe it ſorowe. And ſo hauinge theſe paſſions more moderate in vs, we muſt doo farre more eaſlyer that that apperteyneth vnto our nature, then you do that that belongeth to yours.
            
            
               ¶Vli.
               I would ſaye in dede that thou were fyne, if thou couldeſt proue vnto me, that theſe were more perfecte in you, then in vs.
            
            
               Ho
               I will not trauayle at all in talking of fortitude: For it is ſo manifeſt a thing, that your writers (I ſpeake not of Poetes, to whom it is lawfull becauſe of delectation, to ſaye ſometimes that that is not, but the hiſtoriographers, whoſe duety is onely to ſaye the trueth) when they will ſaye that ſome man is moſt ſtrong, they liken him vnto a Lyon, or to a bull, or to ſome lyke beaſt: and when they will ſpeke of our ſtrength, they neuer liken it to that of a mā. And frō whence commeth this? but becauſe yt they knowe that we are far more ſtronge then you are.
            
            
               Vli.
               This is luſtines of body & not fortitude it ſelfe. O I ſe wel this fellow is alſo one of thoſe, who knoweth nothing, but the benefites of ye body.
            
            
               Ho.
               And

from whence commeth the ſtrength of the body, but from that of the minde?
            
            
               Vli.
               Ye, vnto him who hath a mynde that can perceiue it.
            
            
               Ho.
               And we are of thoſe who haue mindes moſt apte to perceaue it: For that we haue it much leſſe trobled, by hauing fewer paſſions then you haue.
            
            
               Vli.
               And what are thoſe paſſions, that you haue not as we haue?
            
            
               Ho.
               Fyrſt al thoſe thinges that growe of thinges paſt, or of thinges to come. Becauſe we knowe not that that is preſent to vs, nor foreſee that that is to come.
            
            
               Vli
               What paſſions growe alſo of theſe to vs?
            
            
               Ho.
               What paſſions? doeſt not thou knowe it? feare and hope: feare of thoſe thinges that diſpleaſe thee, and hope of thoſe that pleaſe thee, and as alſo gladnes, and ſorrowe, do by thoſe things that are preſent vnto thee, and that delite thee, or by thoſe that are againſt thy minde. And theſe very often kepe your mind vnquiet and thoughtful, in ſuch ſort that they ſuffer you not to doo that that apperteyneth to a fortiall man: and from theſe foure ſpring after, as from one head, all the others. But let vs paſſe ouer further, vnto that that taketh away the

reaſon requireth, bluſteringe abroade to others their ſhamefull deſires, eyther in proſe or in rime, or finally that haue by this occaſiou ronne into ſome foule deth: it ſuffiſeth that you perſwade your ſelues that beautie is a diuine thing, & that loue being a deſire thereof, is a thinge laudable, hiding with that ſpirituall beautie, that is thought to be in God, that little grace, the whiche the well proporcioned bodies haue: and couered with well made colours, and with the name of the deſyre of that, the which is one of the fyrſte perfections of your ſoule, you hyde this your humaine paſſion. I ſaye humaine, bycauſe in vs, it neuer falleth ſo imbridledly and ſo continually, but farre more moderate, and in thoſe times only that nature hath ordeined for the maintenaunce of the kinde.
            
            
               Vli.
               So that we ſee not you alſo do a thouſande follies, by the like occaſion?
            
            
               Ho.
               And what ſee you vs do? but thone of vs to become ſometime ſomwhat enemy to thother: the which commeth of geloſye, that is a common paſſion that groweth alway together, wt this

deſire. But I would not reaſon hereof, fearing leaſt thou ſhouldeſt diſdaine therat, the thinges are ſo wicked and abhominable that ſometimes it leadeth to do. Rede the hiſtories a litle, and thou ſhalte ſee, howe many deceites, how much hatred, how many treaſons, and how many deathes, aſwell of ſworde, as alſo of poiſon (the whiche is a more foule thynge) haue growen in the worlde by this. Soo that I will lay it a ſide, and paſſe euer to thoſe pleaſures that grow by eating, and by drinkinge. Where thou ſhalte finde that what beaſt ſoeuer thou wilt, aſwell wilde, as tame, is farre more moderate then you. For thou ſhalt not finde anye, that at any time eateth or drinketh more then he nedeth, nor that ſeketh for other meates, then thoſe that were ordeined for him by nature: ſome ſede, ſome graſſe, ſome fleſhe, and ſome fruite. Whereas you not contēted with one only, eat of al, and more ouer you cauſe diuerſe thynges to be brought frō euery part of the world to eate. And not contented herewith, you alſo ſeke with arte, that they may

vntemperat, that taketh great pleſure of thinges that appertaine to the ſight, as pictures, images, and lyke thinges are: and much leſſe he that taketh delighte of thoſe thinges that belong to the hearing, as voices and ſoundes are: and ſo alſo he that delighteth of ſauours, if it be not for reſpect of fode, as it chaunſeth to you beaſtes, as the dogge for an example doth, that taketh onely delyght of the ſmell of the Hare, for that he hopeth to eate her. Then reſteth that this vertue be only exerciſed about the delectations of the taſt, and of the felinge: and alſo I will ſaye, further vnto the, that the pleaſure of the touchinge is onelye his obiecte, for that the taſte is a kinde of touchinge, and that this is true, ſe howe he, to whom wine was ſo pleaſaunt, required the Gods that they would make him a longe necke like the cranes: for that the pleaſure that the wine gaue him by touching, thorough a longer ſpace, might endure the more, and be greater.
            
            
               Ho.
               And to what ende ſaieſt thou this?
            
            
               Vli.
               Harken a litle yf it pleaſe the, thou

muſt alſo marke that manne hath the inſtrument of this ſence more perfect then any other beaſte.
            
            
               Ho.
               And howe proueſt thou this?
            
            
               Vli.
               Marke: All the orgaines, and members, wherin the ſenſations are made, muſt be clcane voide, and naked of all their obiectes, foraſmuch as nothing can take againe, that that it hathe: and therefore it behoueth that the eye haue no coloure in him ſelfe at all, nor the taſte likewiſe ſauoure: otherwyſe thone ſhould ſee euery thing of that color he had in himſelf, (as it is to him, who loketh thorough a glaſſe of ſomme coloure) and thother ſhoulde fele euerye thinge of that ſauoure whereof he had altered the taſte, as he doeth who hath made that place bitter, where the taſt is made, by ſome colerike ague, vnto whom euerye thinge ſeemeth bitter.
            
            
               Ho.
               This is moſt true, but I ſee not yet to what ende thou 
                     •
                  ſayeft it.
            
            
               Vli.
               I ſaye it, becauſe the inſtrumentes, in the whyche the touchinge is made, whether they be ſynowes, fleſhe, or ſkynne,

it can not come ſo to paſſe, becauſe theyr obiectes, are chiefelye the firſte qualities: that is to ſaye, heate, drythe, colde, and moiſture: & they being made of foure elementes, can not be altogether boyde of them.
            
            
               Ho.
               How do they then to perceiue them, receiuing them agayne into them, if they haue them?
            
            
               Vli.
               They fele but onely the exceſſe, or the lacke of them, that is to ſay, onely thoſe thinges, that are more or leſſe, hote, colde, drye, or moiſte, then they: and therefore he that hath the fleſh and the ſkinne moſt temperate, ſhall haue his ſence beſt, for he ſhall fele the more euery moſt litle difference: and theſe we men are, (who as it is moſt ſure) haue more temperat complexion then any other beaſt: whereby it foloweth that we haue this ſente more perfecte, and that we fele greater delyghte in the operations of the ſame, then you doo. So that it ſhould be no maxuaile, we feling greater pleaſure, yf we alſo were leſſe temperate: but I graunte thee not this.
            
            
               Ho.
               What? wylte thou denye me, that we ſuffre not our ſelues

to be leſſe drawen by theſe pleaſures then you, ſeing experience contrary at all tymes?
            
            
               Vli.
               I will graunt thee that you abſtayne more from pleaſures, and troble your ſelues leſſe by ſorowes, then we do, & farre more eaſely: but not yet that it commeth of temperaunce.
            
            
               Ho.
               And why?
            
            
               Vli.
               Becauſe (as I haue tolde thee) temperaunce is an electiue habit, made with a right diſcourſe of reaſon: howe can you then haue this vertue in you? fyrſte not hauing reaſon, by the which you ſhoulde determine what this habite is, and what that meane is, by the whiche you ſhoulde not excede in ſorowing, or in takinge delight of thoſe thinges, without the whiche the kinde ſhould not be maynteyned: for the which cauſe ſo great delectations haue bene put by nature, in thoſe thinges that maynteine the indeuiſion, as is the eating and the drinking, and in thoſe that▪ mainteyne the kinde, as the thinges of Venus are, you can not afterward alſo choſe frelye, becauſe you be guided in all your operations by nature, and not of ſo much lybertie as we are.
            
            
               ¶Ho.
               Then from

whence come theſe effectes of temperance in vs, that are ſuch as thou canſt not deny them, yf we haue them not?
            
            
               Vli.
               From an inſtinction that nature hath grue you: who knowing that you are not of ſo perfecte knowledge, that you of your ſelues can chooſe that, that is beſte for your conſeruation, hath cauſed that you can neyther eate, nor drinke, more then your nede requireth: nor alſo, ſo to vſe ſuperfluouſlye anye thinge, whereby your hurte or corruption ſhould growe. And this is not temperaunce, whervnto belongeth frely, neither to be to ſorowfull for thoſe thinges that are not conuenient, nor to take to mutche delyghte of thooſe thynges that are conueniente, and to doo all thinges with meaſure, and when time is.
            
            
               Ho.
               Yf we do all thoſe ſelfe thinges that you ſaye, whether it be by nature, or it be by temperaunce, it is ſufficient for vs.
            
            
               Vli.
               If this were true, it ſhould alſo folowe, that the being led by force, to ſome ende, ſhoulde be better, then the goynge freely and willingly therevnto. Ah, theſe are ſeruile, and of vile mindes: retourne

then, retourn man, and into the ſtate that thou were before, and come with me into thy countrey.
            
            
               Ho.
               I will not graunt thee this: for although I can not defend my reaſon as thou doſt, yet it maketh not that I knowe not, that this beynge is ſo muche better then yours, that I will not remayne thus a beaſte.
            
            
               Vli.
               If thou be then fully thus determined, remaine thou ſo a beaſte ſtill: for truely thou deſerueſt none other beyng then this, ſynce thou ſuffereſt thy ſelfe to be ſo much guided by the ſence, that thou remembreſt no more the lighte of reaſon.
            
         
         
            
            The eight Dialogue. Vliſſes, the Dogge.
            
               YF nature (as our wyſe men of Gretia ſaye) deſyer that euery thinge ſhould come to his ende and perfection: from whence then commeth it, that ſhe hath geuen ſo great power, to theſe our ſenſes, that they drawe continually vnto the earthe, this our mynde? and kepe it almooſte alwayes occupied in theſe earthlye thinges (as it is with this▪ fellowe that was chaunged into an horſe, with whom I ſpake euen nowe) ſo that we are lytle different from brute beaſtes: who, for that they haue theyr ende in the earth, were all made by nature, with theyr face tourned towardes the ſame, and man onely with the face tourned towardes heuen, to geue him to vnderſtande, that he ſhoulde continually lyft vp him ſelfe therevnto: and

beholdinge the operations of thoſe deuine ſubſtaunces, to obteyne a felicitie that maketh him more then a man. But what would this Dogge, that commeth thus towardes me? and beyng by lyttle and lytle commen nigh me, ſtandeth then ſo ſtyll? Truely he ſhould haue done it willingly, folowing his nature, the which is very frendly to man, and for that he ſhould ſee them very ſeldome in this place. I beleue, yea rather I know it for a ſuertie, becauſe experience hath taught it me, that nature hath geuē vs theſe ſences, that are not neceſſary to the mainteinaunce of our life, onely for our better being, and to make our knowledge more perfect: & therby it commeth, that they ſo encline to the earth, where they haue theyr obiectes this our better part: the which (if they wer not) would by her owne nature lyft vp her ſelf continually to heauen. Alaslee howe this Dogge taketh pleaſure in beholding me, and marke if it ſeme not, by the geſtures that he maketh, whyles I reaſon thus with my ſelfe, that he vnderſtandeth all that

ydle, as the more part do, vntill ſuch time as one day arriuing here, I was tranſfourmed by Cyrces, as thou ſeeſt, into a Dogge, of the which being I content my ſelfe far better, then I did of that of man.
            
               Vli.
               But I loke after, or rather moſt erneſtly deſyer thee, that thou tell me, for what cauſe thou iudgeſt, that your beyng is better then ours?
            
            
               Do.
               I am contented Vlyſſes, and I will begin with the vertues, of the which you neuer ceaſe to glory your ſelues, euen as though you paſſed all other beaſtes: as of Juſtice, of fortitude, of temperaunce, and of al other vertues. But I will fyrſt that thou aunſwer me to this. Which ground deſerueth to be moſt prayſed, eyther that, 
                     •
                  nhabyted by the Circlopes, the which is ſayde to bring forth of all kind of corn
                     •
                  , and fruite by her owne naturall goodnes, without being ſowen, laboured, or lylled by any meanes by men: or that grounde of our barren and hylly Itaca, ſcarcely apte to fede gotes: the which though it be tylled with moſte diligence is ſo barren, that 
                     ••
                   neuer yeldeth other then a moſt pore harueſt:

nor it neuer geueth to thoſe that labour it, iuſt reward of their paines? But ſee that herein thou ſet aparte the loue of thy country.
            
            
               Vli.
               Howe can I ſay that that land of the Ciclopes is not to be praiſed more, being ſo fertile, (although I guyded by nature loue mine owne countrye better) if I will not ſay vntruely▪
               
            
            
               Do.
               And the ſame thou ſhouldeſt confeſſe to me of the ſoule, who in this is lyke to the earth: praiſing thoſe ſoules mooſte, who without any ſtudy or labor, bryng foorth of them ſelues, the good and perpecte operations.
            
            
               Vli.
               And this alſo I confeſſe to be true.
            
            
               Do.
               Then thou graunteſt me that the ſoules of beaſtes, who of them ſelues, without any labour or ſtudy, bryng forth vertues, are far better, and more noble then youres.
            
            
               Vli.
               Why, what vertues are theſe that beaſtes of their owne nature are endued with.
            
            
               Do.
               Far greater then thoſe, of the which mā is decked with art. And if thou wilt ſeke this diligently, let vs begin with that that is the firſt and principal of them all.
            
            
               Vli.
               And whyche is that?
            
            
               
               Do.
               Wiſedome, withoute the whiche there can be no vertue at all. For vertue being none other thing then a meane betwene two extremities, determined with iuſt reaſon, it foloweth thereby that there can be no vertue without wiſedome.
               For that meane that is a vertue, is not like the arithmeticall middes, that conſiſteth of like farnes from his extremes, as is (for an example) in the continual quātitie, the centrie of the circle: from the whiche centre as many lines as thou wilte, drawen to the circumference ar al equal: or as the ſixe, is betwene two and tenne in ſeperate quantitie, the whiche is as farre diſtaunte from the one as from the other. But it is like the geometricall middes, the which is diſtaunt from his extremes by a ſimilitude, or els a reaſonable proportion, as for example: the ſixe is betwene nine and foure, where it conteineth once & a halfe the four, and is conteined once and a halfe likewiſe by the nine: Wherby it is ſaid to be a middes betwen thone & thother, by proportiō of reaſon: ſo alſo the middes, in the which vertue conſiſteth,

not being put betwene his extremes by equall diſtaunce, after the ſimilitude of the Arithmetricall middes, it behoueth that a vertue determine it, accordinge to a reaſonable proportion of extremes, to the ſimilitude of the geometricall middes: and this vertue to whom it belongeth to determine it, is wiſedome. Then there can be no vertue wtout wiſedome, and therefore it is reaſonably takē, for the rule and foundation of al: and this (as I haue tolde thee) is found farre more among vs, then among you.
            
            
               Vli.
               And who ſheweth me that this is true?
            
            
               Do.
               Reaſon: tell me I pray the, doeſt thou not graunt me, that the habites are knowen by the meanes of the operations?
            
            
               Vli.
               Ye that I do, for it is true.
            
            
               Do.
               Then ſhalte thou alſo graunt me, that we are more wiſe then you, ſins we do our operations, farre more wiſely, then you do yours. And that this is true, thou ſhalt proue it, by thine owne ſelfe: conſidering diligentlye the operation of euery one of oure kindes, beginning at the leſſer beaſtes: where firſt thou ſhalt ſee the ant

to be ſo wiſe, that he laieth vp in ſommer, all that that he nedeth in winter: and the ſpiders lay their ſnares with very great conſideration, to take certain litle beaſtes to fede them on: and the Waſpes, and many other like, to hide thē ſelues vnder the earth, at thoſe times that are hurtfull to them, I will ſay nothing to thee, of the moſt wiſe gouernaunce of the bees, for that there are ſo many among you, whoo haue conſumed their beſt yeares in diſcribinge their life, and the manoure how they gouerne them ſelues. Then go to the birdes, and thou ſhalt ſee them all to chaunge their place time by time, as it is fit for their nature: thou ſhalt ſee of thoſe, who knowing them ſelues vnapt to bring vp their younge, cauſe them to be couered and nouriſhed by an other, as the Cockow, thou ſhalt ſee of thoſe, who douting that the young the whiche they haue bred, ſhould be none of theirs, haue with moſt greate wiſedome founde the meanes to be aſſured therof, as the Egle, who turneth their eies to the rayes of the ſonne. I wyll alſo paſſe ouer wyth ſcylence,

the wiſedome of the Cranes, that rule them ſelues ſoo ordinately vnder the principalitie of ye one of them, and howe when the others take their reſt, he onely ſtandeth with his head alofte, to take hede to the others, holding a ſtone wyth the one of his fete, for that he woulde not ſleape, and hearing any thinge, he ſheweth them ſtraighte therof. The Partridges, what wiſedome vſe they in defēding their young from the fowlers? the olde ſet them ſelues before, till the other haue time to eſcape. The Swallowes, when they can find no durte to faſten together thoſe litle ſplintars of wood, or of ſtrawe, wherof they make their neſtes, (for they wale them in ſuch ſorte as you do youre houſes) haue not they ſo much wiſedome that they waſhe them in water, and tumblinge them afterward in the duſte, they make it euē as you make morter: then in bringing vp of their young, howe great wiſedome doo they vſe, in cauſinge that euery one may haue his part of the meat, and in getting forthe of all the filthe of the neaſt for that they ſhould lye cleane:

nor howe they can gouerne them ſelues, and defende them from ſuche as would take them, in troubling the water wyth their phines or wt caſting certaine blacke water like inke, and ſome by one menes, and ſome by an other: it ſuffiſeth me that you haue learned of them, the making of ſhippes, and the art of ſailing, the which bring ſo many commodities to the humaine kinde, making the ores after the faſhion of ſome of their fete, and the ſayles in likenes of certaine winges that ſome fiſhes haue, who comminge to the toppe of the water, and ſpreading them forth, are by the helpe of the winde, caried by them: So that finally, if thou ſhalt wel conſider the operations of al beaſtes, thou ſhalt be enforced to confeſſe that we haue more wiſedome then you, and conſequently, that our being is farre better then yours: for that we haue had all theſe benefites frelye of nature: euen as thou haſt alſo confeſſed, that the ground of the Cicſopes▪ the whiche bringeth forth her fruit by her own proper nature, is better then our Itaca, the which would bryng

for the nothinge at all, if it were not labered, and tylled by you.
            
            
               Vli.
               Truely Cleantos, when thou beganneſt to talke of wiſedome, I beleued that whiles thou were man, thou haddeſt ſtudied morall thinges: but thou dyddeſt procede very lytle further, that I perceiued it to be nothinge ſo: ſince thou art not able to tell what wiſedome properly is, and beſides this, confoundinge it often times with arte.
            
            
               Do.
               Wylt thou denye vnto me, that wiſedome is the knowing to gouerne her operations well? and to diſpoſe them well about thoſe thinges that are good for vs?
            
            
               Vli.
               No, but this ſuffiſeth not: for he is not called wyſe, who prouideth, and ordeyneth well one thinge onely: as he (for example) ſhould be, that coulde gouerne him ſelfe well about the healthe of the bodye, or in the exerciſing him ſelfe in the warres, but he that doeth this about all thoſe thinges that appertayne to good and quiet liuinge: and this can not you do, and therfore wiſedome can not be in you: and that this is true, harken to me and I will proue it. Wiſdome is a vertue that

                  
                     ••
                   a diche, wherein he hath heretofore fallen, will not (as it is ſayde for a prouerbe) paſſe. And this commeth of nothing elſe, but for that the imaginatiue repreſenteth vnto him onely the fallynge into that dyche indiſtinctlye, and without anye tyme: wherefore, he not beyng hable to diſcuſſe, whether ſuch a thinge hath bene in the time paſſed, or it be in the time preſent, or it hath to be in the time to come, the which are partes of the tyme, he flyeth, and will not paſſe it. It is very true, that thoſe kindes, who haue this power of the imaginatiue, a lyttle moore perfecte, whereby they knowe thinges ſomwhat more diſtinctlye, ſeeme to haue the memorie: amonge the whiche kindes, thine hath the chiefe place. And therfore it ſeemeth that you remember thinges more, and knowe them better, and perticulerly the mayſter, then any other beaſt doeth. And thoſe other kindes, who haue it moore imperfecte, ſeeme to remember leſſe (as the flyes, whoo driuen from a place, forget it by and by, and retourne thyther agayne. See then howe man

only, for that he knoweth the tyme, is he that hath memorie, whereby he onely, amongeſt all other beaſtes, may be called wiſe. For he that hath not knowledge of the tyme, canne not iudge, when it is good to doo a thinge, and when it is not, the whiche properlye apperteyneth to wiſedome.
            
            
               Do.
               If we haue not wiſedome, what is that that leadeth vs ſo, to doo onely that, that belongeth to our nature?
            
            
               Vli.
               An inſtinction, and a proprietie, that nature hath geuen you for your benefite, that directeth you to your ende. Wherefore, yf thou (for example) ſhouldeſt aſke thoſe antes that were bred the ſpryng tyde paſt, for what cauſe they laye vp in theyr neſtes, wherof to eate, who hauing no knowledge of the winter paſte, can not do it by wiſedome, as thou ſayeſt: it is ſure that they woulde aunſwere, eyther for that we ſee thoſe which begate vs do ſo, or by an inclination that nature hath geuen vs, the whiche cauſeth vs ſo to do.
            
            
               Do.
               Is not this the ſelfe ſame in vs, that you call wiſdome in you?
            
            
               Vli.
               No: rather thone thing is very farre

thing in vayne, hath geuen you neyther thone nor thother, ſince you hauing not to gouerne any others then your ſelues, (except your yong, for the ſmale time that they could not liue without you) the which chaunſeth not to vs, to whom the gouernaunce of a houſhold, and of publike matters belongeth: in the whiche, wiſedome perchaunſe is farre more neceſſarie, then in thoſe of our owne cauſes (and you hauing no nede of any thing, beſides of that, that nature of her ſelfe bringeth forth vnto you, haue no nede to ſupply with arte.
            
            
               Do.
               
                  Ʋliſſes thine eloquence is ſuche, and hath ſo great force, that he who ſhoulde heare thee, and knowe not ſomewhat beyond, would beleue that all that thou haſt ſayd, were true: notwithſtanding as thou beganſt to ſpeake, thou diddeſt fayle (as it is ſayd for a prouerbe) at the gates.
            
            
               Vli.
               And I pray the tel me, what error haue I made?
            
            
               Do.
               Thou diddeſt not number among the knowing habites of your vnder ſtanding, the opinion, when thou diddeſt recken them, and yet thou knoweſt that by the meanes therof you knowe many

thinges.
            
            
               Vli.
               Nay, thou thy ſelf haſt fayled: for thou perceyuedſt not, that I woulde not ſpeake therof, when I ſaide, ſpeking of thinges chauncyng, that I would reſon onelye of thoſe thinges that depend of vs, about the which, wiſdome is exerciſed: and I would let thoſe paſſe, that depend on nature, about the knowledge of the which the opinion is excerciſed: whereby it is no maruell if it be ſometimes deceyued, the thinges that nature bringeth
                     •
                   forth, being ſo many and ſo diuerſe.
            
            
               Do.
               And what was the occaſion that moued thee to doo this?
            
            
               Vli.
               Becauſe that is not worthy to be numbred amongeſt theſe vertues, or intellectual habits, for as much as that bringeth no perfection at al to the vnderſtanding, as theſe do. For man is neuer called wiſe for hauing opinion of a thing, as he is for knowing it. And beſides this, the opinion maye be deceued, and none of the reſt of them can.
            
            
               Do.
               What none? Can not the other habites alſo be deceiued?
            
            
               Vli.
               Not theſe firſt three that are in the ſpeculatiue vnderſtanding, for that their obiectes are vnuature.

The whiche if it be more ryghtlye guided thereby in vs, then it is in you, it is a ſigne that it is better, and that we be more perfecte then you. So that geuing nowe an ende to our commoning, enioy thou the kind that thou thinkeſt better: for I thinking this better wherin I am, wil ſo remaine.

            The ninth Dialogue. Ʋliſſes, the Calfe.
            
               IWill now ſay verely, that the prouerbe is true, which ſaith, that ther is nothing in this worlde that hath bene by nature more iuſtly deuided thē the braine: ſins it ſemeth euen to euery one of theſe beaſtes, with whom I haue ſpoken, to haue ſo much therof in that ſtate wherin they ar, that ther is not one of them that wil geue place to the reaſon of man, who yet diſcorſeth and worketh with reaſon: eſteming their chaunce farre better, then ou

               s, the which yet I can neuer thinke that they had heart to ſaye whiles they were men: but this alſo maye riſe of the great loue, that eache thinge beareth to his being, of the whiche it is ſo ielouſe, that there is none that altogether would chaunge it, with anye kinde of other, for

feare at that change to be put in daunger of loſſe therby, and theſe perchaunce happen more alſo to man, then to any other thing. I ſpeake of the ſubſtaunciall beinge, and not of the accidētal: for I know very well, that an olde manne would chaunge his age, with the age of a young man, and one ſicke, his diſpoſition withe that of a hole, and euery poore man his ſtate with that of a riche. But to chaunge them ſelues ſubſtancially, and to become an other, there are fewe that will do it: for that there is none, or moſt fewe, that beleue that an other is better then theirs. So that it is no maruaile, if none of theſe beaſtes would be perſwaded by me to become manne againe. But alas ſee what a faire Calfe this is that commeth ſo ſafelye feding towardes me: O, what fiercenes ſheweth this beaſt in his forehead? and notwithſtanding howe gentle yet he is, and how he ſuffereth man to handle him: ſurely we are not litle bounde to nature, that ſhe hath made this beaſt, for it is plainely ſene, that ſhe hath made hym

for that he ſhould take from man a great parte of his paines, he beinge of ſuche ſtrength, and therewith ſo eaſye to be handled. I will ſee, if he, who was chaunged into him, was by chaūce a Gretian, the which ſhould happely be: for ſins he hath drawen ſo nigh me, that he mighte heare me reaſon, he hath ſtande ſtill to harken vnto me, euen as thoughe he vnderſtode me. Calfe, tell me, (as he who may do it, geue thee that thou moſt
                  •
                deſireſt) who were thou, and of what place, before thou haddeſt this ſhape?
            
               Cal.
               Euen of the ſelfe ſame countrye that thou alſo art, yf that that thou ſpeakeſt be thine owne proper language.
            
            
               Vli.
               Then thou ſhouldeſt deſire alſoo to returne to ſee Gretia thy countrye againe, aſwell as I doo,
            
            
               Cal.
               No truelye. For where one is well there is hys countrye: but this commeth of the beinge that I nowe haue, that thoughe I might well, I woulde in no wiſe become manne agayne, and hauynge to remaine thus as I am, this is ſo fruitfull and

would deſtroye his beyng: but it mighte well be poſſible that in one onely man, all vertues mighte be founde, yf he had ſo longe lyfe, that he might gette them, hauing an apte witte to doo all thinges.
            
            
               Ca.
               And howe ſo?
            
            
               Vli.
               Becauſe vyces beyng contrary the one to the other, as for example, feare is vnto boldnes, and couetouſnes to prodigalitie, they canne not ſtande togethers: where as vnto vertues, not beynge contrary, but the one rather helper of the other, it foloweth not ſo.
            
            
               Ca.
               And are there not vertues alſo among vs?
            
            
               Vli.
               Not ſo perfecte as in man: and when it were euen as thou ſayeſt, one, or fewe mo onely for a kinde, wher (as I haue tolde thee) man only may haue them all.
            
            
               Ca.
               Yea, ſo ſaye you, but we are of a contrary opinion: Rather I ſaye to thee, that there are many moo vertues amonge vs, then amonge you.
            
            
               Vli.
               And whoo ſhall be iudge hereof?
            
            
               Ca.
               Thou thy ſelfe: for yf thou herken vnto me, I will proue it ſo playnely, that thou ſhalte geue ſentence

agaynſt thy ſelfe. Tell me a lytle: Saye not your wyſe men, that Juſtice is an aſſemble of all vertues, and that ſhe conteyneth theym all in her, geuyng to euery thynge the rightneſſe, and rule, with the which they ſhoulde vſe theym ſelues? For what other is there but ſhe, that commaundeth the fortiall that he feare not, and that he flye not thoſe daungers, that brynge him renowne: and to the temperate, that he geue not him ſelfe ouermuch vnto pleaſures, or that he doo not any thinge inconueniente, to auoyde diſpleaſures: and vnto the meke, that he doo none iniurie vnto others? Who is there beſides this, but Juſtice, that ordeyneth all the doynges of man, meaſuring, and reducinge into a conueniente meanes all theyr doynges: as well thoſe that they doo willinglye and freely, as to

                  ell, to lende, to gage, and lyke thinges: as alſo thoſe that they doo, as enforced, eyther by diſdayne, or by theyr euill cuſtome, or ſecretely, as thefte, kyllinge by treaſon, poyſones, treaſones, and falſe

witnes bearing are, or openly, or without any reſpecte at all, as are villanyes, ſtrypes, meyming of the members, and manſlaughters, and other ſuch lyke outrages.
            
            
               Vli.
               Truely, this that thou ſayſt is true: and for this cauſe there are ſome, that call iuſtice the hole vertue: addinge beſydes this, that ſhe is more perfect then any other. For as muche, as the others make him good, that poſſeſſeth them onelye, as touching them ſelues: and ſhe gouerneth man, not onely as touchinge her ſelfe, but as touchinge others: and wayeth not onely the perticuler benefite, but the vniuer

                  all.
            
            
               Ca.
               Then that that I ſay beyng true, yf I ſhall prove vnto the, that amonge you there is no Juſtice, or mooſt lytle, and not iuſtice truely: it ſhall be proued by conſequence, that amonge you there is no vertue at all, or mooſt lytle and not vertue truely. Alſo yf I ſhall proue vnto thee afterwarde, that there is more iuſtice among vs, then among you, it ſhalbe lykewiſe proued by conſequence, that we haue many moo vertues then you, and that our beyng is farre better

then yours.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thy conclution is mooſte true: but the difficultie is in prouyng it.
            
            
               Ca.
               Shall it not alwayes be proued, when the propoſitions are proued that bringe it in?
            
            
               ¶Vli.
               Knoweſt thou ſo muche logike?
            
            
               Ca.
               Why, what miracle is that, I beyng a Gretian? For thou knoweſt that all we laboure therin, whiles we be children.
            
            
               Vli.
               Go to, folow then.
            
            
               Ca.
               The greater of the two propoſitions, the whiche is, where there is no iuſtice, there is no vertue at all, I haue already proued to thee, ſynce thou haſte graunted me, that ſhe conteyned all vertues in her: for the whiche cauſe ſhe hath bene called, as thou ſaydeſt, the hole vertue.
            
            
               Vli.
               Go to, I am contente: nowe to the leſſer.
            
            
               Ca.
               And this alſo is mooſt euident, yf that ſo famous a propoſition of your wyſe men be true, ſayinge: that euery thinge is knowen by his operations. And I will haue hereof none other witneſſe then thyne: for I thinke my ſelfe mooſte ſure, that yf thou ſhalte diligently conſider the operations of men, thou ſhalt ſaye as I ſaye.
            
            
               Vli.
               Ye, peraduenture

yf they did all after one forte.
            
            
               Ca.
               It ſuffiſeth that thou ſhalt ſee the more part do vniuſtly, by whom the occaſion ſhould alwaies be taken, to make iudgement of thinges. But tell me I pray thee: yf there were iuſtice amonge you naturally, as there is amongeſt us: or yf you liued according to that lawe that is written by nature in the hart of eche of you, what nede ſhould you haue of ſo many lawes, as you haue made? although as it is vſed to be ſayd for a prouerbe: they are lyke ſpiders webbes, for the great beaſtes break them, and the flyes remayne there.
            
            
               Vli.
               It is true, that yf eche one would doo vnto others, as he would be done vnto, as the lawe of nature willeth, there ſhould then nede none other lawes: notwithſtandinge the greater part of them, are made by the declaration of the natural law, and if they ſhould ſwarue from that, they ſhould not be accompted iuſt. For as thou ſhouldeſt knowe, lyke as in ſpeculatiue thinges, there are ſomme as principles that are knowen to euerye man by theyr owne nature, and by the lyghte of the vnderſtanding:

wherfore they nede not be proued, as it ſhould be for an example, that one onely thinge can be, and can not be in one time. And ſome other▪ thinges as concluſions that procede from thoſe fyrſt poyntes, and are grounded in them: Soo are there alſo in actiue thinges certayne lightes, and naturall principles, knowen by a commune notyce, and by the proper nature to eueryman, as for example it ſhould be, not to do that vnto others, that thou wouldeſt not ſhoulde be done vnto thee. And then by theſe principles, come theſe lawes written, and are grounded on them.
            
            
               Ca.
               It ſemeth to me, that they are made, for that you maye be able to interprete this naturall reaſon after your owne faſhion, and to plucke it this waye and that waye, as it pleaſeth you, ſhewing that very often to be iuſte with wordes, that is moſt vniuſt in dedes: and if thou take good hede to yt that I haue ſayde vnto the, wt experiēce thou ſhalt ſe, that he who can beſt wreſt a lawe vnto his deſier, is taken for the beſt doctor.
            
            
               Vli.
               Speake to me of the lawes as touching them ſelues, and

led by Princes, as thoſe, that are gouerned by the chiefe men, or by the publike gouernaunce, and thou ſhalte ſe what place the euill haue there: and howe litle the good are eſtemed, by the onely faut of the proper inordinat loue of thoſe, to whō the diſtribution both of rewards and puniſhmentes belongeth: who very often ſuffer them ſelues to be ſo much corrupted by profit, or by pleaſure, or by ſome other vnreaſonable paſſion, that it is ſometimes ſene, for one like vertuous operation, one to be rewarded, and no eſtimation at all to be made of an other. And likewiſe alſo for one like offence, to puniſhe one greuouſly, & one other not only not to be puniſhed, but to be rewarded and ſet in ſome degree.
            
            
               Vli.
               And when that that thou ſaiſt were true, that there is no diſtributiue iuſtice among vs: howe is it then found amonge you? for thou haſte told me that you are farre more iuſt then we.

               Euen aſmuch as is required for our ſtate and nature. And yf thou obſerue our operations, thou ſhalte know it of thy ſelf, and perticulerly whē thone of

               Euen as much as is amongeſt you, who haue not one moſt litle part therof: but this difference ther is, that among vs it is not founde, for we haue no nede thereof, hauing euery thing in common: and among you, for hauing ſeperate thine from mine you cannot liue frely without it, for that couetouſnes, & that your wicked hungar of riches, hath driuen it away, whereby you neuer do any other thing thē thone to thinke, to poſſeſſe ye, yt is the others, withoute hauinge any reſpecte at al vnto the good and the right in your bargains and commutations of thinges that the one of you maketh with thother: but rather he is accompted amongeſt you the mooſte valiante, who in his trauailing can make the

               Go no farther in numbring the wronges, that are in humain operations: for I alſo know wel that ther are many men, who drawen by their proper loue, do very often, not only that that they ſhould not do: but that that after whē they are not appaſſioned, wold they had neuer done. But this maketh not that there is no iuſtice amongeſt vs: for there are many, aſwel in the diſtributiue, as alſo in the cōmutatiue, who wold neuer do anye thinge againſt the lawe thereof. The examples of whom, for not to be tedious vnto thee, and for that bookes are full thereof, I will not ſhewe the. And thoſe your operations that thou haſt rekened vnto me, ſhew alſo that ther is leſſe iuſtice among you, though they

               No, yf for the wyll, thou vnderſtande therein an habite cauſed by frequented actes: for he is not iuſt, who once or twiſe worketh iuſtlye, but he that alwayes, or at the leaſt moſt commonly, worketh according to the ſame.

As a ſtone for fallinge downe is

neyther prayſed nor diſprayſed, nor the fier for goyng vpwarde. And when thou wouldeſt ſay to me that you worke freely, (for I thinke it ſemeth vnto you that you haue a free appetite) I would a

For, to will that an acte be vertuous and perfecte, it chiefely behoueth that he, who worketh, worke knowingly and wittingly.

            The tenth Dialogue. Vliſſes, the Elephant.
            
               TRuely it is a marueylous thing, that among ſo many Gretians as I haue ſpokē with, tranſfourmed by Circes into diuers beaſtes, there hath bene none that would become man agayne. And yf the prouerbe, the which is common through our Gretia, ſaying: that it is impoſſible, that that, the which many ſaye, can be altogether falſe, were true in all thinges, I might make by this iudgement, that the being of beaſtes, who are voyde of reaſon, wer farre better then ours. But it ſhould onely be true, in thinges that appertayne to the actiue life of man: for when one ſpeketh of the knowledge of our vnderſtanding, about the trueth and the nature of thinges: I haue heard mooſt commonlye one other prouerbe vſed, cleane contrary

to this: the which ſaith, that one ſhoulde knowe as the feweſt. And beſides this I haue alwaies herde our wile men geue many Epithetes to the cōmon people of erring, of vnſtablenes, of wauering, and of many other qualities, all the whiche betaken, litle knowledge and imperfecte iudgement, where by we can not mainteine them both to be true (and yet the nature of prouerbes is, by longe experience to be true) except we vnderſtand the one for things practicall, and th
                  •
               ther for ſpeculatiue. Then ſince the knowledge of the noblenes of the humaine nature, and howe muche the ſame knowledge paſſeth in perfection, the knowledge of other beaſtes, who lacke of the vnderſtanding, and of the ablenes to diſcourſe with reaſon, appertaineth to the contemplatiue parte, whoſe office is the ſeking the truth, it is no maruaile though the moſt parte erre: it ſhall then be beſt ſince Circes hath alreadye reſtored my companions and ſhippes, and they tarye onely for me, that I returne home, and loſe no more time, where I can not ſee that I

might do any profit at all. For I will not therefore that their litle knowledge hurt me, as it doth them: becauſe remaining here, amonge them beaſtes, though I be a man, I ſhould liue after the imagination, and the memorye, as they doo: where as amonge men I ſhould liue according to art, and reaſon: by whoſe menes, drawing nere continually to my perfection, ye rather getting from day to daye part therof, I ſhall come to liue with a more quiet, and better contented mind. Let vs then go towardes the ſhippes, and let vs not take more care for others, thē for our ſelues, for this ſhould be a moſt great folly. But what beaſt do I ſee of ſuch vnmeſurable gretnes walking on the ſe ſtrōd? it is an Elephant, if I through the farre diſtaunce, that is betwene vs, be not deceiued. O howe great is the varietie of nature, in the production of beaſtes: and howe glad I would be, that he who was turned into him, had bene a Gretian, his countenaunce hath cauſed me to loue him ſo much by beholdynge hym: I

will therefore aſke him it: for if I could finde but euen one onely who would by my meanes become man againe, I ſhuld not thinke to haue ſpente theſe my trauailes in vaine. Tell me Elephaunt, yf thou were a man, (as I thinke thou wer) before thou haddeſt this ſhape, what thou were.
            
               Ele.
               I was a Gretian, & of the moſt famous citie of Athenes, where I ſtudied philolophye a very longe time, and my name was Aglafemos. But tell me now why thou aſkeſt me this? for thou knoeſt that Philoſophers ſeke none other thing then to knowe the occaſion of all things, to quiet and ſatiſfye that deſire of knowing, that euery one hath by nature.
            
            
               Vli.
               Oh thanked be the goddes infinitely, that at the laſt I haue founde one louer of the truthe: and one that maye truelye call him ſelfe manne: Knowe thou Aglafemos, that Circes hath graū
                  ted me, thorough her gentlenes, that I may reſtore the humaine ſhape to al thoſe Gretians, that I find in this her I ſtand, who haue bene by her tranſformed into beaſtes

in ſo an Elephante, of the which beinge I am not yet fully reſolued, whether it be better then yours or not. And ther fore I wil not beleue the thus at the firſt: but folowing the cuſtōe of true philoſophers, who although they beleue nothing without the reaſon therof, neyther doo they ſet anye thing at nought, that is ſayde vnto them, though they vnderſtande it not: yf it be not ſo farre contrary to the order of nature that it appere manifeſtly faulſe of it ſelfe. For he, who thoughte not that there were any thing, but that that he vnderſtode, ſhould be counted a foole: I wil therfore harken by what reaſon thou thoughteſt to do me a mooſte greate benefitte in reſtoring me the humaine beinge: and if it ſhall be ſuch as may proue vnto me, that your being is better then ours, (as it ſemeth that thou thinkeſt them,) this nature leſte, and I becomen man againe, I will gladly retourne with thee into my countrye.
            
            
               Vli.
               And I on the other part promiſe thee, if thou ſhalt proue vnto me, that your beinge is better then ours, that then I will

praye Circes, ſhe will tranſfourme me alſo into one of theſe beaſtes, yea and I wil liue afterward here with thee: thy ſpeche hath pleaſed me ſo much, and thy ſo modeſt proceding, ſuch as in dede belongeth to a ryght Philoſopher.
            
            
               Ele.
               I will not binde my ſelfe herevnto, for though it ſeme that I much care not to become man againe, I felte ſo great an alteration and trauaile in my tranſmutation, (an occaſion that I now agre not ſo eaſelye to chaunge this ſtate againe) I finde not yet in dede in this ſtate ſo many commodities, that I may iudge it better then yours. But what reaſon haſt thou, that iudging your being ſo much better then ours, doeſt comfort me ſo earneſtlye to become man againe?
            
            
               Vli.
               I will tell thee it, and becauſe thou art a Philoſopher, I will procede with thee philoſophically. Thou knoweſt that though there be in this worlde almoſt an infinite number, of kindes of creatures, that yet there canne none bee founde whoe hath not ſome proper and particuler operation, the whiche groweth in the ſame kynde

by that fourme, that geueth it that being that it hath, wherby till it lacketh of the beinge, it can not alſo lacke of the workinge.

               Yea and if it were otherwiſe, nature ſhoulde haue made them in vayne, the whiche is impoſſible.
            
            
               Vli.
               Thou knoweſt alſo that the nature, and the being of thinges, is knowen, by their operations. And they ſaye that we haue moſte noble, and beſt being, the whyche haue beſte, and moſt noble operations: for man is not able to knowe the cauſes, but by their effectes.
            
            
               Ele.
               Yea, for the knowing the cauſes of them ſelues, and then by the meane of the knowledge of them to know their effects, appertaineth onely to the firſte cauſe, the whiche is occaſion of all.
            
            
               Vli.
               And by theſe two foundations, thou mayſt manifeſtly perceiue, yt the being of man is far more perfect, then the being of beaſtes. For what is the proper operations of beaſtes?

               And what meaneſt thou by the perceauinge?

               The ſame I thinke, though the knoweledge of manne be called intellectiue: and that of beaſtes ſenſitiue. For this your vnderſtandinge, can knowe nothing at all, without the ſenſes,

               Nay, ſaye not that they be one thynge, for ſoo thou ſhouldeſt erre: neyther ſaye thou alſo, that the intelligence of manne, canne vnderſtande nothinge without the ſenſes: for it may fourme and brynge forthe within it ſelfe, many intelligible thynges, and many conceytes, ingenderinge one thinge by the other, without the helpe of the ſenſes. But it is very true that the begynninge of them, haue preceded from the ſenſes: for there canne be no thinge at all vnderſtode, that the fyrſte begynninge thereof hath not ſprounge frome the ſenſytiue knowledge: and in this ſorte, this propoſition ſhoulde be vnderſtode.

               Vli.
               That the Sonne moueth not, and that he is of ſo ſmall bignes: for he moueth ſoo ſwiftely, that he hath no compariſon at all, eyther with ſhafte, or with any other thing of the world, hauing euery day once (beyng drawen by the fyrſte mouing) to compaſſe the earth, ſo farre diſtaunt from him, wherby be muſt make a farr greater circumference, then that of the earthen globe, the which they ſay is more thē twentye and two thouſand myles in compaſſe. And beſides this, it is greter then the earth about a hundred threſcore and fyue times, as thou myghteſt playnely know, yf thou were practiſed in mathemeticall thynges. The which are no leſſe ſure to our vnderſtanding, then it is to thee to knowe that the colour of the leaues of yonder bay tree are grene, wherof thou deceiueſt not thy ſelfe: but thou haſt not the ſuerty therof, as thou ſhouldeſt haue, yf thou haddeſt the vnderſtanding.

               And why ſo?
            
            
               Vli.
               Becauſe thou ſhouldeſt be able to diſcerne, which are the proper ſenſibles, of one ſence, and whiche are the common,

and are knowen by more ſenſes: and thou ſhouldeſt knowe, howe no ſenſe can be deceyued in the knowledge of his proper ſenſibles: a due diſtaunce beyng betwene the one and the other, and the middes proporcionate: and certayne other conditions neceſſary to lyke operations. And thou ſhouldeſt knowe alſo, howe it might be eaſelye deceaued by the common ſenſibles: wherby thou ſhouldeſt ſee, that thou couldeſt not be deceaued in iudginge that thoſe leaues are grene, the due dyſtaunce beyng betwene thyne eye and them, and the ayre lyghtſome, and the colour, beyng the proper obiecte of the eye: as thou arte deceaued of the mouing, and of the greatnes of the ſonne, both the one and thother beyng common ſenſibles. So that prayſe noo more ſo muche the knowledge of the ſences, the which is the weakeſt of all, yf it be not helpen by the vnderſtandinge.

               Vli.
               Ther are three powers, or knowing vertues: the fyrſte of the which, are the vnderſtandinges of thoſe ſeperated ſubſtaunces that continually turne the heauens, the obiect of

Where our vnderſtandinge withdrawing the things frō the matter, and conſidering theyr proper beyng, and deuidinge there beynge in his partes, or compoſing their predicates, ſubſtantialles and accidentalles, with theyr ſubiectes, hath moſt certaine knowledge of theyr nature.
            
            
               Ele.
               What perfect knowledge can he haue (for example) of man, yf he conſider him without matter: for that there is no man, but he is of fleſhe and bones?
            
            
               Vli.
               The matter of thinges is of two ſortes: thone of the which is called comune, and the other particuler. The comune matter of man is the fleſhe, the bones, the ſinoes and other thinges: and the particuler matter is this fleſhe, theſe bones, and theſe ſynoes. And this perticuler is that, that going continually vnto breking, alwaies varieth. And without this the vnderſtanding conſydereth it: but not yet without the fleſhe and bones: whereby conſyder man as a reaſonable creature of boones, and fleſhe, and mortall: and in this ſorte

vniuerſally, and without perticuler matter, he commeth to be vnuariable: and aſſured knowledge may be had of him.
            
            
               Ele.
               Haue not we alſo the phantaſie that doth the ſelfe ſame? for it receyueth the Images of thinges by the ſenſes immateriallye, and beſides this deuideth and maketh all that it liſteth, and at all times when it will.
            
            
               Vli.
               It is true that the fantaſie is a power ſoo noble, that ſome heretofore haue douted, that it is the ſelfe ſame thing in vs, that the vnderſtanding is. And they that haue not thought thus, haue ſaid that the vnderſtanding at the leaſt, coulde not worke withoute the phantaſie, the whiche is moſt true. But this maketh not yet that it is not farre more inferior then the vnderſtandinge: and that this is true, the fantaſye is a miniſter of the vnderſtandyng, and ſerueth it continuallye in his operations, and thoſe powers that are made by nature for the ſeruice of others, are leſſe parfect, then the others: as thou maiſt manifeſtly ſee in thy ſelfe, that the outer ſenſes, as are the ſight, the hearing

and others, for that they ſerue to our common ſenſe (the which hath not for obiect one onely ſenſible, as they haue, but al) are leſſe noble then he. And he then that ſerueth vnto the eſtimatiue, or fantaſy, is alſo farre leſſe noble then that. But yf thou wilt be more ſure hereof, conſider the operations of youre fantaſie, and thoſe of our vnderſtāding, and thou ſhalt ſee howe farre the fantaſie is inferiour vnto the vnderſtāding. For though your fantaſie take the ſemblaunces, and repreſentations of thinges immateriallye, it can not yet take them, without the properties of the matter that are, the being in quantitie, the being in place, and in tyme, and ſuch like: whereby you canne neuer imagin any thing at all withoute theſe conditions. The which happeneth not vnto our vnderſtanding that can perceiue the nature of thinges, without conſidering quantitie, or place, time, or varietie, and ſuch like appertaining to ye matter: it is true that he getteth theſe his knoledges, from the images that are in the fātaſy, immaterially: for he could not get them of the things it ſelf, for being ſo ſpirituall.

Beſides this, althoughe youre phantaſie, can make alſo, and deuide as it ſhould be, to make of a horſe, & a man, a centaur: and to feine a man without fete & without hands, it can not yet deuide the matter from the form
                     •
                  , nor the accidents from the ſubſtaunce: or make them together as our vnderſtanding doth. And this is, for that the fantaſie comprehendeth both thone and thother, with one only ſē
                  ſation, and in one onely ſubiecte. Beſides this it can neuer imagin any thing, that it hath not ſene to fore: and yf not altogether, yet at the leaſt his partes.
            
            
               Ele.
               Naye I wil not graunt the this yet. For we alſo do cogitate and thinke of many things that we neuer ſawe. Tell me a litle, the ſhepe when he flieth the wolfe, doeth he flye him for that his coloure diſpleaſeth him, or becauſe he hateth his ſhape?
            
            
               Vli.
               No.

               Becauſe he thinketh him to be his enemy.

               And yet notwithſtanding he neuer ſawe, what thing hatred was: ſee then, howe we can thinke on things that we neuer ſawe.

               It is true that you haue

               And what is the principall cauſe of his noblenes?
            
            
               Vli.
               Two powers that he properly hath, the whiche none other beaſt hath, that make him moſt excellent of all others. The one of the which is called vnderſtandyng, and the other is called wyll.
            
            
               Ele.
               And what operations growe of theſe powers, that make him ſuperior to vs?

               Vli.
               Yea, but ſo much as

is onely neceſſary vnto your life, and far more imperfectly: for they work not only in man, for the conſeruation of the being, but of the good and happye beinge. For the vnderſtanding (beginning with him, for that a thing is firſt vnderſtode before it is willed or refuſed) perceiueth not only the ſinguler thinges, as the ſence doth (for this is the moſt baſe operacion, becauſe, as I tolde the before, for that they varye continually, one can not get of them any true certaintie of any thynge at all) but vnderſtandeth the vniuerſalles, forming in him ſelfe a knowledge repreſentatiue of mo indiuiſibles, of one onely kinde, in the whiche mo perticulers doo equallye agre, the whiche knowledge he maketh in this maner. The phantaſye repreſenteth a ſemblaunce vnto the vnderſtanding, and the kinde of one onelye man: with thoſe conditions, that make him to be one onely indiuiſible, that is to ſaye, that he is in one perticuler place, and that he is now, and of ſuch ſhape, and ſuch: and for that ſuch one is not foūd as hath theſe

ſuche conditions, other then that indiuiſible onelye: the vnderſtanding in thys knowledge, knoweth none other thinge then that perticuler manne. But if he tourne after into that reſemblaunce, and vppon that kynd, and begin to diſpoile him of thoſe perticuler conditions, taking all that away that is perticuler, in that indiuiſible: and beholding only the humaine nature, the whiche is in him, formeth in him ſelf an intellectiue kind, bringing forth thys vniuerſall knowledge: the which is, that humaine nature is a corporall ſubſtaunce, mortall, and able to perceiue reaſon: and that in this, all men equally agree.
            
            
               Ele.
               And what more perfectiō in it ſelf hath this vniuerſal knowledge of this your vnderſtandinge, then the perticuler knowledge of oure ſenſe hath?
            
            
               Vli.
               A greater ſuerty of knowing, then that, that thou knoweſt is ſo, and none otherwiſe: and that thou canſt not be deceiued: the which thing the ſenſitiue knowledge can neuer haue. For he that ſeeth this man, and that other man, reſonable, knoweth not yet herefore aſſuredlye

that euery man is reaſonable. And ſo he that ſeeth that a Dogge perceyueth, and a Horſe perceiueth, he ſhall not know by this that all Dogges, and all Horſes perceyue. But he who knoweth that man is none other thing, then a reaſonable creature, knoweth that euery man is reaſonable: and he who knoweth that a beaſt is none other then a corporall ſubſtaunce, animate of a ſenſitiue ſoule: knoweth that euery Dogge, and euery Horſe beyng a beaſt perceiueth. And beſides this he is ſure, that that, that he knoweth, is ſo: and he can not be deceyued: for he knoweth it by hys proper cauſe, foraſmuche as the being man is cauſe, that this and the other perticuler man vnderſtandeth: and the beyng a beaſte is occaſion that this Dogge and that Horſe perceiueth.

               Surelye I beginne to knowe, that this your intellectiue knowlege, is far more noble, for the certeyntie thereof, then our ſenſitiue knowledge is.

For the ſeing vertue can not take the colour of him ſelf, but the thinge coloured. And that this is true, marke howe you neuer make iudgement of colours, but onely of thinges coloured: as alſo all thoſe men do, who folow onely the knowledge of the ſence.

               Our vnderſtanding can alſo, by knowing perfectly the nature of thinges, affyrminge and denying, ſet them together, and lykewyſe deuyde them: the which the ſence can not do. For knowing that the ſubſtaunce receyueth and

                   ſteyneth the accidentes, and that the bodies ſuſteine

                   ſaying affirmatiuelye, the bodye is a ſubſtaunce: and ſo knowynge that the ſubſtaunce is gouerned of it ſelfe, and that the coloure can not be but in others, he wil deuyde, and ſeperate theſe two natures, with denyinge the one not to be the other, ſayinge the coloure is no ſubſtaunce. And beſides this, he can with many of theſe affy

                  mations, and of theſe negations, bringe forth manye diuerſe concluſions, that the ſence could neuer haue knowen: the which thing you can not do. For thogh you flye ſome thinge that is noyſome vnto you, you do it not affyrminge, or denying by waye of diſcourſe, for thys operation paſſeth your power: but guided by the appetite that draweth you, withoute anye thought at al ſo to do.

               Not onely by negation, as many haue ſayde: but ymagininge a fyrſte cauſe, and then after denyinge all the predicates of the ſame, the which haue in them any imperfection at all, as all the materiall conditions are, the which we ſee to be in theſe corporall creatures, ſayinge: that this fyrſt cauſe can not be engendred, is incorruptible, and not variable, by accident, or by any alteration, not taken from any place, not made, not ſubiecte to anye poynt of continuaūce, and ſuch other thinges: nor alſo only by that other meanes of paſſyng excellency, as certaine others ſay, affyrming that it paſſeth in goodnes, in

beautye, in amiablenes, and in all other perfections, al good things, fayre, louing, and perfecte, that we ſee in this vniuerſal world. But he can know it loking in him ſelfe. For he conſidering the nobilitie of his nature, the which conſyſteth onely in this, that vnderſtanding all thinges, as wel ſuch as are inferior vnto him, as thoſe that are aboue him, can after a certayne ſort make him ſelfe like vnto them all, and become all. And conſideringe afterwarde that imperfection, the which he findeth in him ſelfe, that is ſo ſay: that he is in power vnto all thinges, but not yet in acte, and therfore vnderſtandeth not alwayes, but ſomtime ye, & ſomtime no: he can fourme within him ſelfe a kynde of an vnderſtanding more high, and more perfect then him ſelfe, the which may be alwayes in acte, and may alwayes vnderſtand all thinges, and hath ſo vnderſtode them from the beginninge, and can not be in power to receaue any intelligence againe, hauing the kindes in him ſelfe of al thinges that haue bene, or euer ſhalbe.

Certeine moſt wiſe Egiptians beyng heretofore moued by thys ſo great vertue and / propertie of the vnderſtandinge, called man, earthly god, diuine, and celeſtiall creature: meſſenger of the goddes, Lord of the inferioure thinges, and famylier of the ſuperioure: and finally a myracle of nature.

               Vli.
               No: for folowinge the appetite, the ſenſe couereth or hateth only thoſe thinges, that the ſenſe knoweth: and notwithſtanding we ſee that man loueth many vertues, & hateth many vices, the whyche chaunce not vnder the ſenſitiue knowledge. And this power (as I haue told thee) maketh man very noble: for it maketh him free, and maiſter of all his operations. And this is for that the will is free, and hath not bene determined by nature, more vnto one contrarye, then vnto an other. For although the good be her obiecte, ſhe is not therefore determined more vnto that, then vnto the contrarye. Wherfore

it is not with it as with the naturall elementes, who being nere their obiectes and hauing due diſtaunce betwene them, can not choſe but worke: as it is manifeſtly ſene in the fyre, the whiche hauing a matter by it apte to burne, can not ſtay to not burne it. But our will, hauing a good thing ſet before it, and thoughe it be ſomewhat enclyned by nature to folowe it, is not yet conſtrained by any neceſſitie to loue it: whereby ſhe maye loue it and not loue it. Then al the other powers that man hath as a creature, are ſubiecte vnto this power, not alwayes in ſuch ſort that they can not be moued by their obiectes, without the commaundemente of the ſame will, but for that they are diſpoled and ordeyned, to moue at all times that it pleaſeth her. Where by al thoughe the ſyght, when a viſible obiecte is preſented vnto it, is moued naturally by that: the will maye commaund it that it turne it vnto an other obiecte, and ſo maye ſhe doo to all the other ſenſitiue powers. And there is no obiecte, nor force at all, either of earthly, or celeſtiall thynges,

that can commaund her that ſhe wil, but that that ſhe liſt: the which is not ſo with your ſenſitiue appetite, For an obiecte offered vnto it, that it deſireth, moueth of neceſſitie the beaſt to folow it naturally, and without any election, as euery body may well knowe, who will diligently obſerue your operations.

               A worthines ſoo marueilous, that thoſe chiefe wiſe men of Egipte (as I haue tolde thee) called him for this onely, the gret miracle of nature.
            
            
               Ele.
               For what cauſe?
            
            
               Vli.
               For that al other creatures, haue hadde a certeine lawe, by the whyche they can comme to none other ende, then that the whiche was ordeined vnto them by nature, nor can in no wiſe goo foorth of thoſe bondes that ſhe hath appointed vnto them. And man, by hauing this will free, maye obtaine a more woorthye, or leſſe worthy ende, at his pleaſure: either in bindinge him ſelfe towardes thoſe thynges, that are inferioure vnto hym, or

turninge him ſelfe towardes thoſe that are ſuperiour vnto him. For if he will geue him ſelfe wholy vnto the belly: holding his countenaunce, and face continually fixed on the earth, he ſhall become as one that perceiueth nothinge, and like to the plantes: and if he ſhal drowne him ſelfe to much in the ſenſitiue pleaſure, he ſhall become like the brute beaſtes: but yf he lyfting his face towardes heauen, playing the philoſopher, ſhal conſider the beautie of the heauens, and the marueylous order of nature, he ſhall change him ſelf from an erthly beaſt, vnto an heuenly creature: and if he, diſpiſing all the impedimentes of the body, ſhall attende to beholde the diuine thinges, he ſhal make him ſelfe almoſt a god. Who ſhall there then be that maruaileth not at this man? who is not onely moſt noble and lorde of al other beaſtes, but he hath alſo this perticuler condition, geuen by nature, that he can doo, all that he wyll
            
            
               Ele.
               And what is then the cauſe, that this his wyll hauing the good for an obiect, and working frely, you moſt commonly choſing

that that is not good: followe vyces, and leaue vertue aparte?
            
            
               Vli.
               For that the will is ſo maruelouſlye vnited and knytte vnto the ſenſes, and that our vnderſtandinge muſte take (vnto the knowledge of the whiche vnderſtandinge, the election of the will foloweth) all his knowledges by the ſence: who moſt commonlye ſheweth vnto him, in chaunge of the true good, a good diſguiſed. Wherby the will being drawen and ſet looſe by the knowledge of that, and by the intiſementes of the ſenſes, though ſhe choſe not that that is not good, at the leaſt ſhe flyeth it not: and ſhe doeth not ſeuerely the office, that ſhe ſhoulde, to commaunde the ſenſitiue appetite: and ſo all our errours, depende finally, by thoſe partes of nature: that we haue without reaſon, together and in cōmon with you: and not by thoſe by the which we are men.
            
            
               Ele.
               No more, no more Vliſſes, cauſe me nowe to leaue this beaſtyſhe nature, and to become man agayne, 
                     •
                  or my loſſe was to great, to haue bene ſo longe tyme conuerted by Gyrces into an Elephante.

               And I graunt it thee by the aucthoritie
            
            
               
And of that, that the waters ſwete, doth ſprinkle on her face.
            To nouriſh all that mortall is, and of the ſame alſo,
            That hath ſo many ſundry kindes, of creatures high and low,
            Made for the ſeruice al of man: and of that, that to him
            Hath geuen an vnderſtanding cleare, to thende that he ſhould climme.
            And haue thereby the knoledge true, of that firſt cauſe of might,
            And then a wil in him wel ſet, to loue the ſame aryght.
            O ye my powers euery one, praiſe ye that cauſe with me,
            And let the gladnes of my ſpirite, thereto wyth you agre.
            O al ye giftes then of my ſoule, with me ſe that ye ſynge,
            Of thuniuerſall and fyrſt cauſe, of all and euery thinge.
            Of mine vnderſtanding thou lyght, and fredome of my will,
            Agree in one of that ſame cauſe, the heauens with praiſe to fyll.
            
               
O euerlaſting mouer great, that no beginninge had,
            Nor ſhall haue ende, thy creature manne, that thereto is moſt glad,
            Is he that ſyngs this daye thy praiſe, and prayeth with all his powers,
            That honor high, and glory great, to thee be yeares and howers.
            
               Vli.
               Thou hadſt not this knowledge of the firſt cauſe of this hole world, whiles thou liuedſt in that body of a beaſt.
            
            
               Agla.
               No: but as ſone as I was become man againe I felt it ſpring in my mind, almoſt as my naturall propertie: or rather to ſay better, I felt it returne into me againe. For before I was tranſformed by Circes into an Elephante, I remember that I had it (but nowe I haue this more, that hauinge muche more perfectly knowen the noblenes of man, then I did before, I begin to thinke that this firſte cauſe hauing loued him, aboue all other thinges, as the making him more noble then any other beaſt doth plainely declare, that his ende, ſhall not be like vnto thend of other beaſtes▪
