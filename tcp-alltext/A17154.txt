               AN INTRODVCTION
to Prayer.
               
                  FOraſmuch at of our ſelues we
are deſtitute of all good
thinges, and vtterlie voyde
of all neceſſarie helpes to
ſaluation: the Lord our God
of his owne free mercie and
goodneſſ
                     •
                  , offereth himſelfe
to vs in Chriſt, and in him he giueth vnto vs,
in the ſteed of our miſerie, all felicitie: in
the ſteed of our pouertie, the vnſpeakeable
riches of his grace: he openeth vnto vs in him
the treaſures of heauen, that our faith might
wholly behold him, and our hope be fully
ſixed vpon him. In whome it hath pleaſed
him that the fulneſſe of his grace ſhuld dwel,
that from thence wee might all drawe (as
out of a moſt plen
                     •
                  ifull fountaine) the waters
of eternall lyfe, This ſecrete and greate
myſterie is reuealed to ſuch onely, whoſe eies
the Lorde hath opened, to ſee light in his
light. Therefore ſince we are taught by faith
that whatſoeuer wee haue need of, and is
wanting in vs, the ſame is laid vp with God
for vs in Chriſt: it remaineth that wee ſeeke
it in him, and with prayer craue it of him.Rom. 10.
The Apoſtle therefore to ſhewe that true
faith cannot be ſeparate from the inuocation

of Gods holie name, hath ſet this order,
that as faith commeth by the goſpell, ſo by
the ſame faith our heartes are ſtirred vp to
call vpon the name of God, and therefore he
ſaith that the ſpirite of adoption, which ſealeth
in our hearts the witneſſe of the Goſpell,
raiſeth vp our ſpirites that they dare
with boldneſſe ſhew foorth their deſires: it
ſtirreth vpon vs vnſpeakable gronings, and
cauſeth vs to crie with confidence; Abba
Father. By the benefit of prayer therfore we
attaine to thoſe riches which God hath laid
vpon ſtore for vs: for thereby we haue familiar
acceſſe to God, and boldlie entring into
the ſanctuarie of heauen, we put him in mind
of his promiſes: ſo that now by experience
we feele and finde that to bee true indeed,
which by the word we did before but onely
beleeue: now we inioy thoſe treaſures by
praier, which by faith wee did before but
onelie beholde in the Goſpell of our Lord
Ieſus.
               Now howe neceſſarie and profitable this
exerciſe of praier is, appeareth, in that the
Lord himſelfe witneſſeth our whole ſaluation
to conſiſt in the calling vpon his name,
wherby he is whollie preſent with vs: namelie
by his prouidence & fatherly care by the
which hee watcheth ouer vs: by his power,

by the which hee ſuſtaineth and ſuccoureth
our weakneſſe, being euery moment readie
to periſh: and by his goodnes & mercie, by
the which he receiueth vs into fauour, being
miſerably loaden & preſſed downe with ſin.
And hereby groweth ſingular reſt and quierneſſe
to our conſcience. For when we haue
diſcloſed to him our neceſſitie, herein wee
finde moſt ioyful and perfect quietneſſe, that
none of our euils are hidden from him, whom
we are perſwaded to bee-both moſt willing
and alſo moſt able to help vs.
               Now that our praiers may be made in ſuch
wiſe as it ought to be, firſt we muſt ſee that
we be in heart and mind no otherwiſe prepared,
then be commeth thoſe that enter into
talke with God, as we are taught, Eccl 28
Before thou pray prepare thy ſelf, and be not as one
that tempreth God.
               
               We muſt conſider therfore when we pray
in whoſe preſence we ſtande, to whome wee
ſpeake and what we deſire. We ſtand in the
preſence of the almightie Creator of heauen
and earth, & all things therin contained: to
whoſe eternall Maieſtie innumerable thouſands
of Angels do aſſiſt, ſerue, and obey: we
ſpeake vnto him, who knoweth the ſecrets of
our harts: before whom nothing is more odious
thé hypocriſie and diſſimulation: we ask

thoſe things which be moſt to his glory, and
the comfort of our conſciences. We muſt
therefore diligentlie endeuour our ſelues
to remoue all ſuch things as may offende his
diuine Majeſtie. And firſt, that wee be free
from all worldlie cares and fleſhlie cogitations,
wherby our minds are caried hither &
thither, and being drawne out of heauen, and
from the pure beholding of God, are preſſed
downe to the earth.
               And heere let vs call to mind howe vnreuerently
we abuſe the great goodnes of god,
calling vs into familiar talke with him, whēh
we haue not that reuerent fear of his ſacred
Maieſtie, that we would haue of an earthly
creature, or a worldlie prince: but ſuffering
our hearts to be carried away with wandering
thoughts and worldly imaginations, are
otherwiſe occupied, and forſake him in the
mids of our prayer.
               As God is a ſpirite, ſo will he be worſhipped
in ſpirite and truth: that is, in the inward
affections of the heart, and with a true, faithful,
& vnfained kind of worſhip. And therefore
as at all other times hee requireth the
heart, ſo ſpecially, in the time of prayer, when
we ſhew our ſelues in his preſence, & enter
into communication with him: and therupon
when he promiſeth to heare all thoſe that

call vpon him he maketh a reſtraint & ſaith,
that call vpon him in truth. Seeing therfore
that the chiefe dutie of praier conſiſteth in
the heart, we muſt with our whole hart pour
out our prayers vnto God the ſearcher of
hearts, and with a ſyncere, vnfained, & ardent
affection & opening of our heart before god
call vpon him, or els we ſhal not find him.
               Let vs knowe therefore, that none prepare
themſelues rightlie to prayer, but ſuch as
haue a reuerende feare of Gods Maieſtie,
which they cannot haue that come not to i
                     •
                  
vnburthened of earthlie cares and affections
And this is it that is meant in the Scriptures,
by the lifting vp of handes, that we ſhould
remember our ſelues to bee farre off from
God, vnleſſe we lift vp our harts and minds
alſo on high. And therefore it is ſaid in the
Pſalme.

                     ſal. 25 
                  To thee haue I lifted vp my ſoule. 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
Scripture vſeth alſo this maner of ſpeeche,
To lift vp prayer: that they which deſ

                  e to be
heard of God, ſhould not haue their mindes
carried away with earthly cogitations and
vanitie. And though it bee hard to bee ſo
bent to praier, but that we ſhal find that manie
by-thoughtes will creep vpon vs to hinder
our praier: yet the more harde it is, the
more earneſtlie wee muſt wraſtle to ouercome
al lets, and hindrances, & labour withinward

groaninges vnto the Lorde, that he
will linke our hearts faſt vnto him, and not
ſuffer vs to bee ledde awaie from him,Pſal. 86. by the
vaine ſuggeſtions of Sathan, who at all times
compaſſing vs about, is neuer more buſie,
then when we addreſſe our ſelues to prayer,
ſecretelie and ſubtillie creeping into our
breaſts, & calling vs back from God, ſo that
oftentimes, when we with all reuerēce ſhuld
ſpeake to God, we finde our hearts, talking
with the vanities of the worlde, or with the
fooliſh imaginations of our owne hearts.
               Finally, we muſt be in chriſtian charity, loue
and concord with al men ſeeking vnfained,
heartie and brotherlie reconciliation, if we
haue offended any man, before we enter into
prayer, or els God wil not heare our praiers:
yea they are otherwiſe execrable, and ful of
damnable hypocriſie in Gods ſight. And this
that is ſpoken of praier, may bee ſaide alſo of
hearing of Gods word, or anie other ſeruice
of God.
               
                  We muſt therefore laie aſide all malice,
enuie, wrath, grudge, contention, wrangling,
diſſimulation, all guilefull, craftie, and
ſubtle dealing,
                  1 Pet. 2. 
                  and with a ſingle heart doe
to other, as wee would they ſhoulde doe
to vs, Peter willeth, that ſuch as haue once
taſted how good and bounteous the Lorde

is and are becom new creatures by the heauenlie
regeneration, through the doctrine of
the goſpell, ſhould like holie and innocent
babes, lay aſide all ſuch workes of the fleſh,
which do depriue a man of the kingdome of
God,
                  Galat. 5. 
                  And Saint Paule commaundeth vs, that
laying aſide thoſe curſed vvorkes of darkneſſe,
vve should in the ſteed thereof, put on (euen as
the elect of God, holie and beloued) tender mercie,
kindneſs, humbleneſſe of minde, meekneſſe, long
ſuffering, forbearing one another, & forgiuing one
another, if anie haue a quarrell to another, as
Chriſt forgaue vs, end aboue all theſe things (ſaith
he) put on loue, vvhich is the bond of perfection,
& let the peace oh God rule in your hearts vvhen
ye shall ſtand and praie (ſaith S
                     •
                  . Marke) forgiue,Mark, 11
if ye haue anie thing againſt anie man, that your
Father alſo vvhich is in heauen, maie forgiue you
your treſpaſses
                     •
                   for if yee vvill not forgiue, your
father vvhich is in heauen vvill not pardon you
your treſpaſſes.
               Moreouer, we muſt haue ſuch a feeling of
our owne miſerie and wretehednes, as may
worke in vs an earneſt ſorrowe and vexation
of minde for the ſame. Example whereof
wee may ſee in the deare ſeruantes of God,
when they ſay, that out of the deep deepeneſſe,
and out of the middes of the iawes of
death, they vtter vnto the Lord a ſorrowfull

voice. He that deſireth mercy muſt haue a
feeling of his owne miſerie. And therefore
ſaith Dauid: Heale my ſoule O Lord, for I haue
ſinned againſt thee. There is nothing in my flesh
(ſaith hee) becauſe of thy diſpleaſure, neither in
there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin.
               
               This anguiſh and ſorrowe ſtirreth vp in
Gods children a feruent deſire to obtain cō
                  fort,
help and ſuccour at Gods hande, and
therfore ſuch as f
                     •
                  ele themſelues oppreſſed
with great calamities, hauing by the help of
man no hope of deliuerance, doe crie vnto
God with afflicted hearts, as Dauid did in his
diſtreſſe: My ſoule thirſteth for God, euen for the
liuing God: and, as the hart being vvounded brai
                     
                        •
                     th
for the riuers of vvater, ſo panteth my ſoule
after thee, O God.
               
               This is that godlie ſorrow which S. Paule
ſaith, worketh in Gods children repentaunce
to ſaluation. The Lorde is nigh to them (ſaith
Dauid) that are of a contrite heart, and vvill ſaue
all ſuch as are afflicted in ſpirite. To him vvill
I looke, euen vnto him (ſaith the Lord) that is afflicted
and broken hearted, and trembleth at my
vvordes. Therefore Dauid calleth the time
of trouble, the fit and conuenient time for
the faithful to fly vnto God by prayer. And
albeit they be not at al times in like diſtreſſe
or continuallie groning vnder the burthen

of preſent euils: yet muſt they needes bee
euer in dread of new daungers, and carefully

                     •
                  ffraid of further troubles to follow. As trouble
and feare therfore are the verie ſpurs to

                     •
                  ir them vp to heartie and feruent prayer:

                     •
                  o by occaſion thereof they haue more free
acceſſe vnto God, as though he did therby
call them vnto him.
               This godly ſorrow for ſinne, and feruent
deſire and longing for Gods louing mercie
and fauour, commeth not of our ſelues, but
of the ſpeciall goodneſſe of God: for we are
of our ſelues dul and without al luſt to pray,

                     •
                  ea, ſo great is our imperfection, that wee
know not howe to pray as wee ought, and
therefore the ſpirite helpeth our infirmities,
inſt
                     •
                  ucteth vs what is right, and guideth our
affections. Hee maketh interceſſion for the
Saintes (ſaith 
                     〈◊〉

                        •
                     anings vvhich
cannot be expreſſed: that is, hee ſtirreth vp our
he arts, giueth vs a deſire and boldneſſe to
pray, & cauſeth vs to mourn when we are by
any meanes hindred from it, and feele not
our ſelues moued therunto with ſuch feruent
zeale and affection as we ſhould be.
               Now although wee knowe that it is the
only work of the holie Ghoſt, thus to mo
                     •
                  e
and incline our heartes to prayer, notwithſtanding

we may not be negligent & ſlouthfull
to diſpoſe and ſtirre vp our ſelues therevnto,
but rather contrariwiſe, ſo often as we
feele our ſelues colde, and not diſpoſed to
praier as we ought to be, wee muſt make our
ſupplication vnto the Lorde, that it woulde
pleaſe him to inflame vs with his holie ſpirit,
wherby we may be framed to pray with
ſuch feruencie of mind, as we ought to doe.
               When we are caſt downe by the ſence &
feeling of our owne infirmity, ſinne aud miſerie:
Yet muſt we pray (notwithſtanding) in
ſure and ſtedfaſt hope to obtaine our requeſts.
Theſe be things in deed contrarie in
ſhewe, to ioyne with the feeling of the iuſt
vengeance of God, ſure affiance of fauour,
which things doe yet verie wel agree in that
it is the goodneſſe of God onlie that raiſeth
vs vp being oppreſſed with our owne euils,
from the which of our ſelues we cannot riſe.
For as repentance and faith are knit as companions
together, (albeit the one driueth vs
downe with feare, and the other lifteh vs vp
again with comfort) ſo in praying they muſt
needs go together. And this agreement Dauid
expreſſeth in few wordes.Pſal. 5. 
                  I vvill (ſaith
he) in the multitude of thy mercies enter into thy
houſe, and in the temple of thy holineſſe I vvill
vv
                        •
                     rship thee vvith feare.
               
               
                  
Therefore when wee are once touched
with true repentance and feling of our own
miſerie, we muſt withall haue ſuch a perſwaſion
of Gods fauor and mercie towards vs in
all our praiers, that they ſhall be accepted of
God ſo far foorth as it ſhall be neceſſary for

                     •
                  s.1. Iohn. 5 
                  This is the aſsurance▪
                   ſaith S. Iohn, that vve
haue in God; that if vve aske anie thing according
to his vvill he heareth vs. If we haue not a ſure

                     •
                  ruſt and confidence in the mercie and promiſes
of God, it is vnpoſſible to make our
praier to him aright: and whoſoeuer doubteth
whether God heareth his prayer, that
man obteineth nothing: to ſuch praiers
God hath made no promiſe. But contrariwiſe
he ſaith, vvhatſoeuer ye shall a
                        •
                     ke in praier,
if ye beleeue,Matt. 21 
                  ye shall receiue it. And againe,
VVhatſoeuer yee deſire,
                  Mark. 11 
                  beleeue that yee shall obtaine
it: and it shal be done vnto you. Ask, ſaith
Saint Iames, in faith and vvauer not, for hee
that vvauereth,
                  Iame. 1 
                  is like to the vvaues of the ſea,
vvhich are toſsed of the vvind and caried avvaie.
And why ſhould wee wauer or doubt ſeeing
the holie ſcriptures teſtifie of God, that
he is faithful, iuſt and true in all his wordes
and promiſes, ſaying. The Lord is faithfull in
all his vvordes, hee vvill euer bee mindfull of his
couenant: the trueth of the Lorde endureth for
euer▪
                  
               
               
                  
And although our faith be not ſo ſtrong, and
therfore our prayer ſo hearty and zealous as
it ought to be: yea, though our faith be faint
and cold, yet let vs hold faſt this principle,
that our praiers are not fruſtrate or in vaine.
               For our comfort herein we haue an example
in the father which brought his ſonne
firſt to the Apoſtles and afterward to Chriſt
and ſaide.Pſal. 51. 
                  If thou canſt Lord, help: and yet afterwarde
hee acknowledged the weakeneſſe
of his faithe, and deſired to be made
ſtrong. I beleeue, Lord (ſaith hee) help my vnleefe.
How often doe the children of God
complaine of this imbecillitie and weaknes
of faith? Such as are exerciſed in true praier
doe feele, that in crauing of God the forgiueneſſe
of their ſinnes, they bring ſcarſlie
the tenth part of that ſacrifice which Dauid
ſpeaketh of, where hee ſaith: An acceptable
ſacrifice to God is a troubled ſpirite:
                  Mark. 9 
                  a broken
and an humble heart, O God, thou vvilt not
deſpiſe. Manie times they are driuen to wraſtle
with their owne dulneſſe and coldneſſe
in prayer: Manie times their mindes ſlippe
aſide and wander away in vanitie: Manie
times they feele not their owne lacke and
miſerie to pricke them ſharplie enough to
prayer: yea, and many times they are ſo beaten
down with the ſenſe and feeling of their

owne ſinne and miſerie as though they were
forſaken of God, and their faith vtterlie extinguiſhed.
               In what horrour and anguiſh of heart was
Dauid when he ſaid vnto the Lorde? VVhy
loeſt thou reiect my ſoule?
                  Pſal. 88. 
                  VVhy hideſt thou thy

                        •
                     ace from me?
                  Pſal. 39. And againe, Ceaſe from me vntill
I goe avvaie and be not. VVhereby it might
ſeem, that he (like a deſperate man) deſireth
nothing els, but that the hand of God ceaſing,
he might rot in his euils: but it is not ſo.
For he ſaith it not, for that he would haue
God to depart from him, as the reprobate
doe: but onely hee complaineth, that the
wrath of GOD was too heauie for him to
beare. A hard temptation is it when the
faithfull are compelled to crie:Pſal. 80. 
                  Hovv long

                        •
                     vilt tho

                      be angrie againſt the praiers of thy ſeruants?
                  Lamen. 3
As though their verie praiers made
God more angrie, So whē Ieremie ſaith, The
Lord hath shut out my praier, no doubt hee was
ſhaken with a vehement pang of temptation.
               Theſe are the imperfections of Gods children,
which euen in beleeuing and hoping,
doe oftentimes vtter ſome vnfaithfulneſſe,
and in the verie remedies fall into new diſeaſes:
for there is no prayer they make,
which the Lord would not woorthily loath
and abhorre, if he ſhould not winke at their

ſpottes & imperfections. And ſuch example
are common in the Scriptures.Whereby w
                     •
                   ſee
that the Lord oftentimes ſuffereth his to
be grieuouſlie tempted and afflicted, and 
                     •
                  ideth

their great conſolation in the end.

Such is the louing kindneſſe and mercie of
God towards the afflicted, when they are ſorie
for their ſinnes, lamenting and mourning
in their harts, to be deliuered from the ſame
that they might ſerue God in the freedome
of conſcience.
               
                  This is that mourning, this is that hunger
and thirſt that Chriſt ſpeaketh of: Bleſsed are
they that mourne,Math. 5 for they shal bee comforted:
bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſse,
for they shal be ſatisfied.
               God for his trueth ſake, will put the righteouſneſſe
of chriſt on them, and waſh their vnrighteouſneſſe

Reede vvill hee not breake, and the ſmoking Flaxe
vvil he not quench. The afflicted, the heauie and
broken hearted, the vveake and feeble vvill hee
not forſake: Yea, be they neuer ſo feeble and
ſo fraile, yet ſo long as this luſt, deſire and
mourning to bee deliuered from their ſinne
and miſerie, remaineth in them, God ſeeth
not their ſinnes, reckneth them not, nor laieth
them not to their charge, for his trueths
ſake and loue to Chriſt, hee is not a ſinnes
in the ſight of God, that would be no ſinner.
Hee that woulde bee deliuered, hath his
heart looſed alreadie, his heart ſinneth not,
but mourneth, repenteth, and conſenteth to
the lawe and wil of God, and iuſtifieth God,

this is, he beareth record that God which
made the law is righteous and iuſt: and ſuch
an heart truſting in Chriſts bloud, in Chriſts
righteouſneſſe, is accepted for righteous, and
his weaknes, infirmitie and frailtie is pardoned,
and his ſinnes not looked vppon, vntil
god put more ſtrēgth in him: the increaſe
whereof he ſhall dailie feel in ſuch ſort, that
at length he ſhall in all troubles bee able to

               And this wee are alſo no leſſe bounde to
doe by the commandement, wherby we are
forbidden to take the name of God in vain.
For in that we are there forbiddē to take the
name of God in vaine, we are commaunded
alſo to take and to vſe it to his glorie, giuing
vnto him the praiſe of all goodneſſe, helpe,
and ſuccour, whileſt we aske and looke for
the ſame at his hande. Wherfore except we

                     •
                  lie vnto him in our trouble & neceſſitie, except
we call vpon him for releeſe and ſuccor,
we prouoke his diſpleaſure no leſſe, then if
we ſhould make vnto our ſelues Idols, or
worſhip ſtrange gods: for in the contempt of
euerie one of the commandements, we ſhew
like contempt and diſobedience to the will
of God, and all thoſe ſentences which commaunde
vs to call vpon God, do appertaine
vnto this commaundement: Thou shalt not

                        •
                     ake the name of the Lord thy God in vaine: and
ſo praier is a worke and chiefe ſeruice belonging
to this commandement. Wee may
not therefore thinke that there are no ſins
but Idolatrie, murther, theft whoredome,
and ſuch like, but that it is vndoubtedlie
a great ſin alſo, not to render this ſeruice to
GOD, that is, not to praie, not to aske,
not to looke for helpe from God in our neceſſities,

not to render thanks for the benefits
we haue receiued.
               Therefore if our vnworthines at any time
do crie out againſt vs, ſtop or feare vs in ſuch

                     •
                  orte that our conſciences are aſtonied and
flie from God: if we doubt whether God hath
reſpect to our paiers groannings and teares,
we muſt ſet before our eies, how that we are
commanded, though we be neuer ſo vnworthy,
and our ſinnes neuer ſo manie and great
to pray for reconciliation, Gods fauour, and
forgiuenes of our ſinnes. For els, whereas
God commaundeth vs to abſtain from theft,
murther, whordome, &c. we maie in like ſort
excuſe our ſelues and ſay, that we are vnworthie
to obeie Gods commandements: great
is our iniquitie, & manifeſt is our contempt
and deſpiſing of God, when wee neglect and
delaie to call for his help. Such as flie vnto
God therefore, to call vpon him in their neceſſities,
obeie his will, and find therein no
ſmall conſolation, knowing that therby they
doe vnto him moſt acceptable ſeruice, for as
much as he pronounceth that nothing is to
him more acceptable, then obedience to his
wil and commandement.
               
                  As wee are commanded of God boldlie
and without all reſpect of our owne vnworthineſſe,
to come vnto him as a mercifull father,

and one that knoweth our neceſſity, &
pittieth our miſerie: ſo hath he promiſed verie
gratiouſly to heare vs, and graunt our requeſtes.

in hearing of ſinners, ſaith: Before they cry I
vvill anſvvere, and vvhiles they are yet thinking
vvhat to ſpeak, I vvil heare.
               
                  
Among many ſweete promiſes of GOD,
though theſe might be ſufficient to prouoke
vs to feruent and hearty prayer, yet there be
certaine other notable and moſt comfortable
promiſes, which we ſhuld ſpeciallie hauein
remembrance,Luke. 12. as theſe: If yee vvhich
are euill can giue good giftes to your children,
havv much more shall your heauenlie father giue
the holie Ghoſt to them that deſire him?
                  
                     
                        •
                     ccle. 2. 
                  Conſider
the olde generation, and marke them vvell? vvas
there euer anie confounded that put their truſt in
the Lord? or vvho hath continued in his feare and
vvas forſaken? or vvhom did he euer deſpiſe that
called vpon him? And of all other that is the
moſt notable, which by the Prophet Ioel is
added immediatlie after, the propheſie of
that horrible deſtruction that was at hande,
ſaying; VVhoſoeuer shall call vpon the name of
the Lord shal be ſaued.
               
               Heere let vs conſider the order of promiſes,
which pertaine either outwardlie to the
bodie or inwardly to the ſoule. Which parte
(the ſoule I mean) becauſe it is much more
precious than the other, wee muſt firſte
craue ſuch things as properlie belong to the
ſaluation thereof. But firſt of all confeſſing
our ſinnes vnto God with moſt humble and
penitent hearts, let vs ſet before vs the promiſes
of remiſſion of the ſame. For this

ſentence is true: God heareth no ſinners: that
is, ſuch as delight and continue in ſin. Wherfore
in all other praiers, yea when we bee about
to aske any other thinges, whatſoeuer
they be, let vs firſt thinke of the remiſſion of
ſinnes, hauing alway in our ſight ſome comfortable
promiſes thereof as this: If vve confeſse
and acknovvledge our ſinnes, hee is faithfull
and righteous to forgiue our offences,
                  1. Iohn. 1 
                  and to cleanſe
vs frō all iniquities. And hereunto let vs craue
the light of the holie Ghoſt, to kindle and
confirme in vs the true knowledge of God.
Let vs pray for the continuance of Gods holie
word and Goſpel among vs; for the enlarging
of his kingdome, and the aduancing
of his glorie. Let vs beg the gift of faith,
repentance, feare, patience, prayer, hope,
loue, ioy, peace of conſcience, with ſuch
other fruites of the ſpirit, and for euerlaſting
lyfe.
               And here alſo we muſt remember that we
do not onely call our ſelues continuallie to
account for our new ſinnes, crauing at gods
hand mercie and forgiuenes of the ſame, but
alſo for thoſe ſinnes which might ſeeme to
haue been long agoe forgotten;Pſal. 51. as Dauid hauing
confeſſed an hainous offence, by that
occaſion returneth euen to his mothers
wombe, wherein he had gathered the infetion

heaping together the ſins of the whole
life. Euen ſo in another place when hee aſketh
another thing hee ſaith, Remember not
the ſinnes of my youth: remember me according to
thy mercie,
                  Pſal. 25 
                  for thy goodneſſe ſake, O lord. Againe,
Looke vpon mine affliction and trauell, and forgiue
all my ſinnes.
               
               VVhen we haue thus prayed for thinges
pertaining to the ſoule, and to the kingdom
of God, we muſt praie alſo for corporall benefits,
as well common as priuate, as peace
and tranquillitie of thoſe Countries which
giue harbrough to the true profeſſors of the
goſpel and godlie congregations, being in
this life, as Daniell in the mids of the Lyons,
Pray for the peace of Ieruſalem, ſaith Dauid,
Alſo for defence from miſerie,Pſal. 88. deliuerance
frō trouble, for happy ſucceſſe in the workes
of our vocation, for health, liuing, protection
of life, goods, name, &c.
               And although the Lorde knoweth before
we aske what we haue need of, and is ready
to giue liberally, yea & doth giue oftentimes
vndeſired▪ and furthermore hath promiſed,
that ſeeking firſt the kingdome of god & the
righteouſnes thereof all other things ſhould
be giuen vs: yet he commaundeth vs to aske
corporall benefits, and that for three cauſes.
               Firſt, that wee ſhoulde knowe that hee is

the author and giuer thereof, and therefore
ſhould not onlie be thankfull for the ſame,
but alſo ſtirred vp therby to ſeeke, loue, and
worſhip him.
               Secondlie, that we ſhuld be wel perſwaded
of his good prouidence toward vs,Ioſua. 
                        •
                     1. when wee
vnderſtand that he doth not onely promiſe
that he will neuer faile vs, but alſo hath his
hand alwaies ſtreched out to help them that
call vpon him.
               Thirdlie, that our faith of reconciliation
and forgiueneſſe of ſins ſhould bee exerciſed
through the asking of thoſe corporal things.
               And herein we muſt ſpeciallie and aboue
al things ſeek the glorie of God, & therfore
we muſt praie for theſe corporall thinges in
ſuch ſort, that we may offer therwith our obedience
vnto God. Here of we haue examples
of Chriſt when he ſaid, Father, if it be poſſible,
let this cup paſſe from me: neuertheleſse not as
I vvil, but as thou vvilt. with this obedience
to the will of God ſpake Dauid, when he deſired
to be brought again into his kingdom
ſaying, If I shal find fauor in the ſight of the lord,
hee vvill bring me againe:
                  
                     
                        ••
                      Reg. 15 
                  but if hee shall ſaie
vnto me, thou doeſt not pleaſe me,
                  Iob. 3. 
                  I am ready
let him doe as it ſeemeth good. And Iob ſaith,
Though he kil me yet vvill I put my truſt in him.
               
               Therefore for as much, as we doe knowe

that it is the lot of Gods children to bee alwa
                     •
                  e
vnder the croſſe, and therfore concerning
thoſe corporall benefites, we know not
how, or what to aske as wee ought: wee
muſt herein offer our obedience vnto God,
abiding his good will & pleaſure ſo long as
it ſhall ſee me good vnto him to exerciſe vs
in the want thereof, who ſuffereth vs ſometime
to be afflicted for our chaſtiſment, and
for the probation of our countenance, and
alſo that we may receiue with greater gladneſſe
(if to his diuine wiſdome it ſeeme expedient
for vs) that which with ardent deſire
we long looked for. S. Paule ſaith: VVhen
vve are iudged,
                  1. Cor. 15 
                  vve are chaſtened of the Lorde,
becauſe vve should not bee condemned vvith the
vvorld. But when we pray for ſpiritual things
we muſt aske them abſolutely and without
condition: for hereunto doe pertaine the
chiefe promiſes of the goſpell, of the which
God would haue vs moſt aſſured. Verilie verilie
I ſaie vnto you (ſaith Chriſt) hee that beleeueth
in me,
                  Iohn. 6. 
                  hath euerlasting life. As ſure as I
liue (ſaith the Lord) I vvill not the death of a
ſinner,
                  Eze. 33. 
                  but that he returne and liue.
               
               To the promiſe of God wee muſt ioyne
examples, wherby we learne that God hath
hard & holpen thoſe that call vpon him. For
all deliuerances, whether they bee of other

(wherof the ſcripture are ful) or of our ſelues
(whereof wee haue experience) are examples
of Gods promiſes. Hereby did Dauid
comfort himfelfe in the anguiſh and heauineſſe
of his heart,Pſal. 77 ſaying: I vvill remember the
vvorks of the Lord, and call to mind thy vvoonders
of olde time. Thou haſt mightilie deliuered thy
people,
                  Pſal. 31. 
                  euen the ſonnes of Jacob and Ioſeph. Againe,
I vvill be glad and reioice in thy mercie:
for thou haſt ſeene my trouble, thou haſt knovvn
my ſoule in aduerſitie. And thus being warned
both by promiſes and examples, let vs learne
to caſt our care vpon the Lord, to call vpon
him, and to looke for help at his hande. So
ſhal our faith by little & little be more firme
and certaine, and our heart ſhal reſt in hope
and exſpectation of Gods help.
               
                  But for aſmuch as of our ſelues we are vnwoorthie
to appeare in Gods ſight, whoſe
terrible Maieſtie comming once into our
minde, it is impoſſible but that we ſhould flie
from him as a fearfull Iudge: therefore he
hath giuen vnto vs, a Mediatour, euen our
Lord Ieſus, that he being a meane between
God and vs, might chaunge the throne of
dreadfull glorie into the throne of grace, &
that we by his merites hauing acceſſe vnto
God, might haue aſſured truſt to find grace
in his ſight.
                  1. Ioh. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . If anie man ſinne, ſaith S. Iohn,
                  
vve haue an Aduocate vvith the father, Jeſus
Chriſt the iuſt,Actes. 10 and he is the Reconciliation for
our ſinnes. To him, ſaith Saint Peter, beare al the
Prophets vvitneſse that through his name at that
beleeue in him shall receiue forgineneſse of their
ſinnes.Epheſ. 5. By vvhome, ſaith Saint Paule, vve haue
boldneſſe and enteraunce in all confidence through
faith in him.Heb. 4. 
                  And againe. VVee haue not an
high prieſt vvhich cannot haue compaſſion on our
infirmities, but vvas in all points tempted like as
vve are, ſinne excepted: let us goe 'boldlie therefore
unto the throne of his grace, that vve may
receiue mercie, and find grace to helpe in time of
neede.
               And as wee are commanded to call vpon
God, and haue a promiſe alſo to be heard: euen
ſo we are commanded to make our praiers
vnto him in the name, faith & confidence
of this our mediator, and wee haue no promiſe
to be heard without him: in whom are
all the promiſes of God yea and Amen,2. Cor. 1.
confirmed and fulfilled.Luke. 11 
                  And no man commeth
to the father but by the ſonne.
               
               
                  For he is our mouth whereby we ſpeake to
the father, hee is our eie whereby wee ſee
the father, and he is our right hande whereby
we offer ourſelues to the father. VVhatſoeuer
therefore we aske in his name, wee
haue a promiſe to obtaine it.
                  Iohn. 16.

                     ,

(ſaith Chriſt) I ſaie vntoyou vvhatſoeuer ye
                     •
                  
shall aske the father in my name, hee shall giue it
you: in my name, that is, for my ſake: your highe
Bishop praying for you. Hetherto yee haue not aſked
anie thing in my name:Iohn. 14. aske and yee shal receiue.
In that day ye shall aske in my name, and
vvhat ſoeuerye aske, I vvil doe, that the father
maie be glorified in the ſonne.
               Of praier there be two parts, petition and
thankeſguing. By petition we poure foorth
out deſires before God, requiring firſt thoſe
thinges that may ſet forth his glorie, and
then ſuch benefites as are profitable and neceſſarie
for vs. By giuing of thankes, wee
praiſe and magnifie his benefites beſtowed
vppon vs, acknowledging that whatſoeuer
good things we enioy, we haue receiued thē
of his free goodnes and liberalitie. Therfore
Dauid ioyned thoſe two partes together in
one verſe, when he ſaith, Call vpon me in the
day of neceſſitie:
                  Pſal. 50. 
                  I vvill deliuer theeand thou
shalt glorifie me.
               
               The ſcripture commaundeth vs to vſe
both, and that continuallie. For our neceſſitie
is ſo great, our life is ſo full of troubles
and calamities, and ſo many daungers hang
ouer our heades euerie moment, that wee
haue all cauſe ynough, yea, euen the moſt
holie with ſighes and groanings continually

to flie vnto God, and call vpon him in moſt
humble wiſe. But this we may better perceiue
in things pertaining to the ſoule.
               For when ſhal ſo many great ſins, whereof
we know our ſelues guiltie, ſuffer vs to be
without care & not to craue pardon of God
for the ſame? when will Sathan giue vs reſt
and quietneſſe? when will he ceaſe to range
about ſeeking whom he may deſtroy? when
ſhall our tentations giue vs truce, ſo that we
ſhall not need to haſten vnto God for helpe?
Finallie, the deſire of the kingdom and glory
of God ought to drawe vs whollie vnto it,
not by fits, but continuallie, that all times
ſhould be fit and conuenient for vs to pray.
Wherefore not without cauſe wee are ſo often
commaunded to pray continuallie. And
though we be not driuen with like neceſſitie
at all times to praie: yet in this caſe S, Iames
teacheth vs what we ought to doe. If anie
man be heauy or afflicted, ſaith he, let him praie,
that is, let him craue Gods helpe and comfort:
and vvho ſo is merrie, let him ſing, that is,
let him praiſe God.
               Moreouer, the benefites and bleſſinges of
God, are large and plentifull towardes vs,
which way ſoeuer we turne vs, that wee can
neuer want matter and occaſion of praiſe
and thankſgiuing. And ſeeing wee ought

to acknowledge God to be the author and
giuer of all good things, we ſhould alway receiue
the ſame at his hande with thankſgiuing:
for to that end God continually beſtoweth
his good bleſſinges and benefits vpon vs
that we ſhould continuallie ſhew foorth his
praiſe, and be thankful vnto him for the ſame
and ſo we render vnto him his due honour.
And S. Paul, when he ſaith, that they are ſanctified
by the word and praier, ſignifieth, that
to vs they are not holy and cleane without
the word and prayer, and therefore Dauid
ſaith, when he had felt the liberalitie of the
Lorde, that there was put into his mouth a
newe ſong, that is a new occaſion of praiſe
and thankſgiuing. Whereby he ſignifieth,
that it is a wicked ſilence if we paſſe ouer anie
of Gods benefits without praiſe, ſeeing
that as often as he doth good vnto vs, ſo often
he giueth vs occaſion to ſpeake good of
him. We ſhould therefore continually, that
is, as much as is poſſible, at all times, in all
places, and in things as occaſions are continually
offred vnto vs, lift vp our prayer vnto
God in crauing helpe at his hande, and confeſſing
his praiſe, whereby we may both obtaine
of him all good thinges, and alſo praiſe
and magnifie his name for all.
               Howe this perſeuerance in prayer is required

of vs, Chriſt himſelfe teacheth vs by
the parable of the three loaues,Luke. 11 18 and of the
widdowe, and wicked Iudge. VVherby wee
are taught to continue in peaier, with all earneſtnes
and feruent ſupplication, and neuer
to faint or giue ouer, vntill we be aſſured in
our ſpirit that our praiers be heard.
               The prayer of the humble (ſaith the Sonne
of Sirach) goeth through the clouds,
                     
                        •
                     ccl. 35. it ceaſeth not
vntill it come neare, and it vvill not depart vntill
God the moſt high God haue reſpect thereto.
Beholde (ſaith Dauid,) as the eyes of the ſeruants
looke vnto the hand of their maiſters,Pſal. 123. and as
the eies of a maiden vnto the hand of her miſtreſse
of our eyes vvaite vpon the Lorde our God vntill
he haue mercie vpon vs. And thus muſte
wee not ceaſe to doe, vntill wee may boldlie
ſay alſo with Dauid: The Lord hath heard
the voyce of my vveeping, the lorde hath hearde
my humble petition, the lorde hath receiued my
praier.
               Now concerning the forme and manner
of praying, leaſt wee ſhoulde followe our
owne fantaſie, being of our ſelues ſo blinde
that wee knowe not howe to praye, or what
is meet and expedient for vs: The Lord him
ſelfe hath ſufficientlie inſtructed vs: who
as he hath taught vs throughout the whole
Scripture, howe and for what thinges wee

ought to pray, ſo hath he ſet foorth one maner
of prayer, in the which he hath brieflie
comprehended all ſuch thinges as we ought,
yea, or in anie wiſe may aske of God.
VVherein hee hath expreſſed what is due,
pleaſing and acceptable to him, what is neceſſarie
for vs, and what he will grant: ſo
that there is nothing heerein omitted, that
might be thought vpon to the praiſe & glory
of God, or come into the mind of man for his
profite and commoditie. And this is that
praier that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt taught his
Diſciples: when they asked of him how they
ſhould praie.
               VVhoſoeuer therefore ſhall ask any thing
that is not contained in this praier, they
preſume to adde ſome thing of their owne
to the wiſedome of God, they are not obedient
to his will:Mat. 9. and they pray without faith,Luke. 11.
hauing no word of God to warrant them, and
therefore they shall obtaine nothing. This
praier, ſaith Tertullian, is the doctrine of the
wiſedome of God, wherein he hath taught
whatſoeuer hee willed, and willed whatſoeuer
was needfull. Albeit wee are not ſo
bounde to this forme of praier, that wee
should not vſe anie other kinde of wordes
then the Lord himſelfe heerein hath vſed.
For there are elswhere ſet forth in the ſcriptures,

manie prayers farre differing from this
in words, and yet written by the ſame ſpirit,
and verie profitably to be vſed of vs. And many
prayers alſo are continuallie vttred of the
faithful by the ſame ſpirit, which vary from
the ſame in wordes. But this is required of
vs, that none ſhuld look for, ſeek or ask anie
other thing at all, then that which is brieflie
cōprehended in this praier, & which, though
it differ in words, yet differeth not in ſenſe &
ſubſtance: like as it is certaine that all the
praiers which are found in the ſcriptures, &
which do continually proceed from the hart
of the faithful are referred by the direction
of Gods ſpirite vnto this praier, howſoeuer
they differ in the varietie of words.
               Manie good and godlie men, euen in our
daies well exerciſed in praier, haue left vnto
vs moſt worthy examples and teſtimonies
hereof, furniſhed with ample and large matter
to forme holie and true praiers, and full
of power to inflame the heart to a feruent
inuocation of Gods holy name: whereof wee
haue giuen here ſome taſte to the Godly, and
ſpecially to the ſimple, not yet wel exerciſed.
               
                  Read them, meditate, and praie, and ye shal find
comfort in your ſoules.
               
            
            
               
               A Meditation concerning
prayer.
               
                  THe mind of men hath
ſo large roomth to receiue
good things that
not king in deede can
fully ſit it, but onely
God, whome thou
the mind fully poſſeſſeth, when it fullie
knoweth him, fullie loueth him,
and in all things in framed after his
mill.
               They therefore (deare Lord God)
that are thy children, and haue taken
ſomewhat of thy goodneſſe, doe perpetually
ſigh, that is, doe may vntill
they come thereto: & in that they loue
thee alſo aboue all things it wonderfully
woundeth them, that other men
doe not ſo, that is loue thee, and 
                     〈◊〉
                  
for thee with them.
               Whereof it commeth to 
                     〈◊〉
                  , that

they are inflamed with continuall
praiers and deſires, that thy kingdome
might come euerie where, and
thy goodneſſe might bee both knowen,
and in life expreſſed of euerie
man
               And becauſe there are innumerable
many thinges, which as well in
themſelues, as in others, bee againſt
thy glory, they are kindled with
continuall prayer and deſire, ſighing
vnſpeakably in thy ſight, for the increaſe
of thy ſpirite. And ſometimes,
when they ſee thy glorie more put
backe, than it was wont to bee, eyther
in themſelues, or in any other,
then are they much more diſquieted
and vexed,
               But becauſe they knowe, that
thou doeſt rule all thinges after thy
good will, and that none other can
helpe them in their neede, they oftentimes
doe goe aſide, al buſineſſe laide

apart, and giue themſelues to godly
cogitations & talke with thee, complaining
to thee as to their Father,
of thoſe thinges that grieue them,
begging thereto, and that moſt earneſtly,
thy helpe, not onely for themſelues,
but alſo for others, ſpecially
for thoſe whome ſingularly they imbrace
in thee, and often doe repeate
and remember thy gracious benefits
both to others, and to themſelues
alſo: where through they are
prouoked to render to thee heartie
thankes, theirby beeing inflamed, as
well aſſuredlie to hope well of thy
good will towardes them, and patiently
to beare al euils, as alſo to ſtudy
and labour to mortifie the affections
of the fleſh: and to order all their
whole life to the ſeruice of their brethren,
and to the ſetting forth of thy
glory.
               This they knowe is that prayer

which thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our
Lord cōmaunded to be made to thee
in the chamber, the doore being ſhut.
In this kind of praier hee himſelfe
did watch often, euen all the whole
night. He
                     •
                  rein was Paule frequent
as all the Saints b
                     •
                  . This kind of
praier is the true lifting vp of the
minde to thee. This ſtandeth in the
affections of the heart, not in words
and in the mouth. As thy children be
endued with thy ſpirite, ſo frequent
they this talke with thee. The more
thy ſpirit is in theme, the more
                     •
                   are
they in talke with thee Oh giue me
plentifully thy ſpirits, which thou
haſt promiſed to powre out vpon all
fleſhe, that thus I may with thy
Saintes talke with thee night and
daie, for thy onely beloued Sonnes
ſake, Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.
               Moreouer, thy Saintes, to prouoke
them to this kinde of praier, do

vſe firſt there neceſſitie, which they
conſider in three ſortes: inwardlie
concerning their ſoules: outwardly,
concerning their bodies: and finally
concerning their name & fame: wherto
they adde the neceſſitie of theſe
that he committed to them: the neceſſitie
of thy Church, and of the common
weale.
               Secondly, they uſe thy commandements,
which require them vnder
paine of ſinne, to pray to thee in all
their neede.
               Thirdly, they vſe the conſideratiō
of thy goodneſſe, which art naturallie
mercifull to young Rauens
calling vpon thee, much more then
to them, for whome Rauens and all
thinges elſe were made: for whome
thou haſt not ſpared thy deare ſonne,
but giuen him &c.
               Fourthly, they vſe the 
                     〈◊〉
                   ſweet
and free promiſes made to heare, and

helpe all them that call vpon thee in
Chriſtes name.
               Fiftly, they vſe examples ho we
that thou which art the GOD of
all and rich vnto all them that call
vpon thee in Chriſts name, haſt hard
and holpen others calling vppon
thee.
               Sixtly, they vſe the benefites giuen
them before they aſked, thereby
not onely prouoking them to aſke
more, but alſo certifying their faith,
that if thou waſt ſo good to graunt
them many thinges vnaſkt, nowe
thou will not denie them any thing
they aſke, to thy glory and their
wealth.
               Laſt of all, they vſe the reading
and weighing of Pſalmes and other
good praiers, becauſe they knowe
that thereby peculiarlie, beſides the
other Scriptures▪ there is no ſmall
helpe
                     •
                   as may appeare by Paule Epheſ.

                  
                     •
                  . whereby he willeth the congregation
to vſe Pſalmes, hi
                     ••
                  es,
and ſpirituall ſonges, but ſo that
in the heart wee woulde ſing and ſay
them. Not that thy children doe
not vſe their tongues and wordes
in praying to thee: for they doe vſe
their tongues, ſpeeche, and wordes,
to ſtirre vp their inwarde deſire and
feruencie of the minde, ful wel knowing
that elſe it were a plaine mocking
of thee, to pray with lippes and
tongues onely. Oh that I might
feele nowe the ſpirite ſo to affect mee,
that both with heart and mouth, I
might heartily and in faith pray vnto
thee.
               Now concerning the things that
are to bee prayed for, thy children
knowe, that the prayer taught by thy
ſonne moſt ſurely and plainly doth
containe the ſame, and therefore they
often vſe it, firſt aſking of thee their

heauenly father, through Chriſt, that
thy name might euerie where bee had
in holyneſſe and praiſe: then, that thy
kingdome by regeneration & the miniſterie
of the Goſpell might come:
& ſo thirdly▪ that willinglie, perfectlie,
and perpetuall, they might ſtudie
to doe, yea doe indeede, thy will
with thy holy and heauenly Angels,
and ſpirits. Theſe things they ſeeke
and pray for, namely thy kingdome
and thy rig
                     •
                  hteouſneſſe, before anie
worldly benefite.
               After which petitions, becauſe all
thinges, yea euen the benefits of this
preſent life doe came, from thee, they
doe godly deſire the ſame vnder the
name of daily bread, being inſtructed
of thy wiſdome, that after ſpiritual
benefites to aſke corporal, is not
vnſeemly vnto thy children which
knowe both ſpirituall and corporall
to come 
                     〈◊〉
                   thy mercie.
               
                  
In the other petitions they prair
for thinges to bee taken from them,
beginning with forgiueneſſe of ſins,
which were impudentlie praied for,
if that, their heartes were not ſo broken,
that they coulde forgiue all
things to al men for their part. They
adde their profeſſion, that is, charytie,
whereby they profeſſe, that they
haue forgiuen all offences doone to
them.
               How be it becauſe it is not enough
to haue pardon of that which is paſt
except they bee preſerued from newe
offences they pray thee, not to kinde
them into temptation, by permitting
them to the peruerſe ſuggeſtions of
Sathan, but rather to deliuer them
from his importunitie and power:
vnderſtanding Sathan the authour
of all euill: Oh (deare God) that
thou w
                     •
                  uldeſt endue mee with thy
ſpirite of grace and prayer with

thy children accordinglie, to make
this prayer alwaies whenſoeuer I
doe pray.
               As for outwarde euils, ſo long as
they doe not (as it were) inforce thy
people to ſinne, in that Chriſtian perfection
doth account them amongeſt
thy benefites. Thy Sonne hath not
taught thy Church to pray for the
taking away of them in their prayer:
for heere he hath contained but thoſe
thinges for the which all Chriſtians
generally and particularlie may of
faith pray at all times.
               It often commeth to paſſe, that
exterior euils, becauſe they bee not
euils indeede, that is, they bee not againſt
Gods grace in vs, therefore
they cannot of faith bee praied for, to
bee taken away: for thy children that
haue faith, doe alwaies preferre thy
iudgement, before their owne. The
which iudgement when they knowe

by that which hapneth to them, they
ſubmit themſelues thereto wholy: although
the ſpirit make his vnſpeakable
gronings to helpe their infirmities
by prayer, not to haue them taken
away, but that they might haue
ſtrength, and patience, to beare the
burden accordingly. Which burthen,
if it bee too heauie in the bitter ſenſe
end feeling thereof, they in their preiers
doe complaine ſome thing, rather
than pray to haue it taken away, as
our Sauiour did in▪ he garden when
he added to his complaint: Not my
will, but thy wil be done.
               
               So do thy people in all their complaintes
adde, Not as we will, but as
thou wilt: For they are taught by
thy ſpirit, no otherwise to pray for
the taking away of corporall euils,
either from themſelues, or from others,
vnleſſe they by the ſame ſpirite
doe certainely ſee the ſame to

make to thy glorie: as

               Nowe though thy children doe
knowe that thy will cannot but bee
doone, and nothing can bee done, but
that thou of thine owne will haſt determined
to doe, although no man
ſhoulde deſire the ſame, yet are they
earneſt and frequent in prayer: firſt
to render obedience to thee: which
requireſt prayer as a ſpirituall ſeruice
to thee: ſecondly, becauſe thou
haſt ordained praier to bee as an inſtrument
and meane, by the which
thou workeſt thinges with thee alreadie
decreede and determined.
               Thy children doe vſe prayer to offer
thee their ſeruice, if it ſhall pleaſe
thee to vſe the ſame: and as they doe
eate and drinke, which is a meane
ordained of thee for the conuerſation
of their life, not looking thereby to

lengthen their daies aboue their
bounds, which alreadie thou haſt appointed,
but as it becommeth them, to
vſe the meanes, which thou haſt ordained
to ſerue thy prouidence: ſo do
they (as men heerein not curious to
knowe thy prouidence further than
thou reuealeſt it) vſe prayer as a mean
by the which thou art accuſtomed to
worke many of thy childrens deſires,
that according to thy good will, thou
mayeſt vſe the ſame.
               They doe not thinke a mutability
in thee (for thou art God, & art not
chaunged: with thee there is no variableneſſe)
and therefore they pray not
as men which would haue thy determination
and ordinances (which are
in moſt wiſedome, and mercy) to bee

                     ••
                  tered, but rather that they might
ſubmite their wils to thine, and make
them more able to beare thy will and
pleaſure,
               
                  
They knowe thou haſt promiſed
to helpe them calling vppon thee:
wherfore they doubt not, but ſo thou
wilt doe, and therefore praie accordinglie.
               They loue thee hartilie, and therefore
they cannot but deſire much to
talke with thee, that is, to pray: euen
as a well manered and louing wife
will not take vpon her to aſke anie
thing of her huſband at all, but that
ſhe hopeth hee wil take in good part,
and do of his own free wil, although
ſhe had ſpoken nothing thereof.
               When ſhe knoweth what her huſbandes
will is in thinges ſhe gladly
talketh with him thereof, and according
as ſhee ſeeth hee is diſpoſed to
doe, ſhe wil often deſire him to doe it.
Euen ſo thy children (I ſay) which
heartilie loue thee, in that they know
thy wiſedome and will is beſt, howe
can they but often talke with thee,

and deſire thee to do that which they
knowe is beſt, which they know alſo
thou wouldeſt do, if none ſhoulde aſk
or pray for the ſame?
               Thy children vſe prayer, as a
meane, by the which they ſee plainly
thy power, thy preſence, thy prouidence,
mercie and goodneſſe towards
them, in graunting their petitions,
and by prayer they are confirmed of
them al. Yea thy children vſe praier
to admoniſh them, howe that all
things are in thy handes. In praier
they are (as it were) of thee put in
minde of th

enſueth, and they conceiue a
purpoſe to liue more purely euer afterwardes,
and more heartilie to applie

               Who nowe conſidering ſo manie

great commodities to come by reaſon
of prayer, would maruell, why
thy children are much in prayer, and
labouring to prouoke others therevnto.

               As concerning outward thinges
which thy children praie for, although
they know thy will and decree is not
variable, & thy purpoſe muſt needes
come to paſſe, yet doe they receiue by
their prayer no ſmall commoditie.
For, either they obtaine their requeſtes
or not. If they doe obtaine
them, then proue they by experience

that thou doeſt the will of them that
feare thee, and ſo they are more kindled
to loue and ſerue thee. And in
deed for this purpoſe thou art wont,
when thou wilt doe good to anie, to
ſtirre vp their mindes to deſire the
ſame good of thee, to the ende that
both thou and thy giftes may & bee
ſo much the more magnified and ſet

inflame them with loue towardes
thee, to perceiue and feele thee ſo to
care for them, heare them, and loue
them?
               If they doe not obtaine that they
pray for, yet vndoubtedly they receiue
great comfort, to ſee that the
euils which preſſe them, and whereof
they complaine ſtill, do not oppreſſe
and ouercome them, and therefore
they receiue ſtrength to beare the

ſame the better. O good father help
me that I might heartily loue thee,
complaine to thee in all my needes, &

heart before thee, Amen.

of thy ſelfe thus (I ſay) in

ſure certificat, that thou art my father
for his ſake: & I thy deare child,
although of my ſelfe I am moſt unworthy.
For thou according to thy

Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, but giuen him
to the death of the Croſſe for my
ſinnes Thou wouldeſt he ſhoulde
he made fleſh of our fleſh, and bloud

be made fleſh of his fleſhe and bloud

enioy in him and through him the
qualities, vertues, & giftes of righteouſneſſe,
holineſſe, innocencie, immortalitie,

hath endued our nature in his owne

faith and hope we haue the ſame, ſo
in his comming, we might fullie enioy

               Herein appeareth thy loue,1. Ioha. 3 not
that we loued thee, but that thou louedſt
vs, and haſt giuen thy Sonne
for vs. Heerein eocſt thou commend

vnto vs thy loue, that when wet
were yet ſinners, Chriſt thy deare
ſonne died for vs,Rom. 5. ſo that nothing
ſhoulde ſeperate vs from thy loue in

perſecution, famine, neither

               And that I ſhoulde not doubts

all this to pertaine to me where I

At thy handes and from thee, as
I muſt looke for allthings, ſo come
I vnto thee, & pray thee to giue mee
theſe thinges, which thy deere children
haue, and thou requireſt of mee
that I may come and aſke them of
thee, as now I do, through Ieſus
Chriſt our Lord.
               As by this worde (Father) I am
taught to glory of thee and in thee,
and all that euer thou haſt (for thou
art wholy mine, my Lorde, my God,
my father:) ſo by this word (Our) I
am taught to glory of all the good
that all and euerie of thy ſeruantes
that euer were, are, or ſhalbe, had,
haue, or ſhall haue. For now I am
taught to beleeue that thou haſt called
mee into the communion of thy
Church and people, whome heereby
I perceiue th

                   hoſt commaunded to
bee as carefull for mee, as for themſelues,
and in all their praiers to be

as mindful of me, as of themſelues.
               Againe, as by this word (Father)
I am taught to remember & render
my duty I ow to thee wardes, faith,
loue, feare, obedience, &c. So by this
word (Our) I am taught my dutie
towards thy people, to be carefull of
them, and to take their ſorrow, pouertie,
affliction, &c. as mine owne, and
therefore, to labour to helpe them in
hart and hand after my vocation and
ability, vtterly abhorring all pride,
ſelfe loue, arrogancie, and contempt of
anie.
               By reaſon whereof I haue great
cauſe to lament, and to reioyce. To
lament, becauſe I am ſo farre from
conſideration, much more from doeing
my duetie to thy, people in
thoughts, words and deeds. To reioyce,
becauſe I am called of thee, and
placed in the bleſſed ſociety of thy
Saintes, and made a member and

citizen of the heauenly Ieruſalem: &
becauſe thou haſt giuen in commaundement
to all thy Church, to bee as
carefull for me as for themſelues.
               But alas, how farre am I heerefrom?
As I am guiltie of vnthankfulneſſe
for this thy callyng mee into
the bleſſed communion of thy deare
ſonne and Church, yea of thy ſelfe:
ſo I am guiltie of ſelfe loue, vnmercifulneſſe,
pride, arrogancie, forgetfultneſſe, and contempt of thy children:
for elſe I could not but bee otherwiſe
affected, and otherwiſe labour than
I doe.
               Oh be mercifull vnto mee good
Father: forg
                     •
                  ue me and grant for
Chriſtes ſake, that as my tonge
ſcundeth this worde Our, ſo I may
in heart feele the true ioy of thy bleſſed
compaſſion, and the true loue
and communion which thy children
haue and feele towardes▪ their brethern:

that I may reioyce in all troubles
in reſpect of that ioyfull communion:
that I may denie my ſelfe to
honour thy children vpon earth, and
endeuour my ſelfe to doe them good
for thy ſake, through Ieſus Chriſt
our Lorde. I come onely to thee, to
giue mee that which I cannot, nor
muſt not elſewhere haue, and thou
requireſt it of me, that therefore I
ſhould as thy childe, come and crane
it to thy glorie.
               Which art in heauen.
               AS by theſe wordes Our Father,
I am taught to glorie and reioyce
for the bleſſed communion which I
am called to with thee, deare Father,
with thy Chriſt, and with
thy holy Church: ſo alſo am I heere
taught by theſe wordes, which art in
heauen, to reioyce in reſpecte

of the place and bleſſed ioyes whereunto
at the length in thy good time
I ſhall come. For nowe I may perceiue,
that as heauen is thy home, ſo
is it mine alſo, being, as I am, thy
child through Chriſt, although here
for a time I am bodily on earth and
in miſerie.
               Againe, by theſe wordes, which art
in heauen, I am admoniſhed, not onlie
to diſcerne thee from earthly Fathers,
and to know howe that thou
art Almighty, preſent in all places,
and of moſte puritie to confirme
thereby my faith, to be prouoked the
more to feare thee, to reuerence thee,
&c. But alſo I am admoniſhed to
iudge of thy fatherly loue, by heauenly
benefites, and not by corporal,
ſimply and alonely: for oftentimes
the wicked proſper more in the world
and haue more worldly benefites
then thy children. So that by this I

ſee, thou wouldeſt pull vp my minde
from earth and earthly thinges, to
heauen and heauenlie thinges, and
that I ſhould ſee further by corporal
benefits thy heauenly prouidence for
me. For if thou place mee thus on
earth, and thus bleſſe me as thou doeſt,
and hitherto haſt done from my
youth vp, in that thou art nothing
ſo carefull for my bodie, as for my
ſoule: how ſhould I but think much
of thy prouidence, for it is thy home
where is ſuch glorie as the eie hath
not ſeene, &c. Of which thinges
theſe corporall benefits of thine giuen
mee on earth, ſhoulde bee (as it
were) inductions, and the taking
of them away, admonitions to bee
more mindfull of permanent thinges
and leſſe mindfull of tranſitorie
thinges.
               By reaſon heereof I haue greate
cauſe to lament and to reioyce. To

Lament. becauſe I am ſo earthlie
minded, ſo little deſirous of my home
ſo vnthankefull for thy prouidence
and fatherly protection heere on
earth.
               To reioyce, becauſe of thy home
and the greate glorie thereof: becauſe
thou doſt ſo prouide for me heere becauſe
thou doeſt ſo cortect and chaſten
me, &c. But alas, I am altogether
a wretch, earthly, and vnthankfull,
not onely for theſe corporall benefites,
health, riches friendes, fame,
wiſdome. &c. for thy fatherly correction,
ſickneſſe, temptation, &c. but
alſo for thy heauenly benefites, for
Chriſt Ieſus, for the promiſe of thy
ſpirit, for thy Goſpel, &c. yea, euen
for heauen it ſelfe and thy whole glorie,Pſal. 106.
as the Iſraelites were for the
lande of Canaan, and therefore neuer
enioyed it, but periſhed in the wilderneſſe,
I am proude in proſperitie

and forget thee, waxing ſecure and
careleſſe. I am impatient in thy croſſe
and too much conſider worldly diſcommodities.
               Oh deare father, forgiue mee for
thy Chriſtes ſake all mine vnthankfulneſſe,
loue of this world, contempt
and obliuion of the heauenly benefites,
and grant me thy holy ſpirite
to illuminate the eies of my minde
with the light and liuely knowledge
of thy preſence,Col. 3. power, wiſdom, and
goodneſſe in thy creatures,Phillip. 3 but ſpecially
in Chriſt Ieſus thy ſonne, and
ſo by the ſame ſpirit inflame mine
effections, that I may deſire nothing
on yarth but thee, and to bee preſente
with thee, that my conuerſation may
bee in heauen continuallie, from
whence graunt mee ſtill to looke for
the Lorde Ieſus, to make this my
vile bodie like vnto his owne glorious
and immortall bodie, according

to his owne power by which he
is able to do all things. As thou haſt
giuen me to be thy childe: ſo I pray
thee, giue me theſe thinges which bee
the properties of thy children, giuen
from thee in thy good time.
               Hallowed be Thy name.
               Thy name is that whereby thou
art knowne, for names ſerue to
decerne and knowe one thing from
another. Nowe, though thou art
knowne by thy creatures, yet is this
our corrupt eſtate, they ſerue but to
make vs excuſeleſſe.Rom. 1. Therefore moſt
properly, liuely, and comfortablie
thou art knowne by thy holie word,
and ſpecialy by thy promiſe of grace,
and freelie pardoning and receiuing
vs into thy fauour,Pſal. 84. 138. for Chriſt Ieſus
ſake.Howe Gods name is halowed. For the which goodneſſe in
Chriſt, thou art praiſed and magnified,
according to thy name, that

is, ſo much as men know thee in
Chriſt, they magnifie thee, and praiſe
thee, which here thou calleſt hallowing
or ſanctifying. For that thou art
the more holy, not in reſpect of thy
ſelfe, but in reſpect of men, who the
more they know thee, the more they
cannot but ſanctifie thee, that is, they
cannot but as in themſelues by true
faith, loue, feare, and ſpiritual ſeruice
honour thee: ſo alſo in their outward
behauiour, and wordes, they cannot
but liue in ſuch ſort, as other ſeeing
them, may in, and by their holineſſe
and godlie conuerſation, be occaſioned,
as to know thee, ſo to ſanctifie
thy name accordingly: and therefore
thou ſetteſt forth here vnto me, what
is the chiefe and principall wiſhe
and deſire of thy children and people,The chiefe deſire of Gods children
                        •
                     
                  
namelie, that thou in Chriſt
mighteſt be truelie knowne and honoured,
both of themſelues and of

other inwardly and outwardly: as
by the contrary a man may caſtlie
perceiue,The greateſt grief of Gods people. that the greateſt ſorrowe
and griefe thy people haue, is ignorance
of thee, falſe ſeruice or religion,
and wicked conuerſation. Againſt
the which they pray and labour
diligently after their vocation,
as they for the obtaining of the other,
both to other and to themſelues, doe
take no ſmale paine in prayer, ſtudie,
and godly exerciſe.
               By reaſon heereof I ſee,Our ignorance. that I am
farre from this deſire & lamentation
which is in thy children, I ſee
mine ignorance of the true knoweledge
of thee and thy name: for elſe
it had not needed thee ſo by thy word
to haue reuealed thy ſelfe. I ſee alſo
mine owne ignorance of the excellencie
of the ſame: for elſe wouldeſt
thou not haue toulde mee, that the
ſanctifiyng of thy name is the chiefeſt

thing thou requireſt of euery man.
               Againe, I ſee my greate want of
holyneſſe:Our greate neede for elſe thou needeſt not to
teach mee to ſeek and pray for that I
want not.
               Moreouer, I ſee my greate peruerſitie,
which would not ſeeke at thy
handes for ſanctification, although
I ſee my neede thereof. For the
which thou wouldeſt not haue commaunded
me to pray, if I ſeeing my
want, would haue prayed vnto thee
for the ſame.
               Laſt of all,Gods loue. I ſee thy wonderful
goodneſſe, which wilt vndoubtedly
giue vnto mee ſanctification and holineſſe:
for thou wouldeſt not that I
ſhould aſke for that thing, that▪ thou
wilt not giue me.
               So that I haue greate cauſe to lament
and reioyce. To lament, becauſe
I am ſo farre from this deſire
and lamentation which thy children

haue. Alſo becauſe of my ignorance,
pouertie, peruerſitie, vnthankfulnes,
&c. But moſt of all, becauſe thy holy
name, worde and religion is ſo blaſphemed
both in doctrin and in liuing
of many, eſpeciallie in this realme.
               To reioyce I haue great cauſe, for
thy exceeding goodneſſe and mercie,
which wouldeſt ſo diſcloſe thy ſelfe
by thy workes, worde and Goſpell:
which wouldeſt open theſe thinges
thus vnto me, and ſo giue vnto mee
and others ſanctification in thy ſight
by faith, and in the ſight of men by
pureneſſe of life, and godlie conuerſation.
But alas, I doe heartily neither
the one nor the other, that is, lament
or reioice, as thou father, which
ſearcheſt my hearte, doeſt right wel
know.
               Oh, be mercifull vnto me, and forgiue
me, yea, giue me of thine owne
pittie, thy holie ſpirit to reueale and

open to my mind effectually my miſerable
eſtate & condition, my ignorance,
peruerſitie, and my careleſnes
for thy true honour and diſhonour? in
ſuch ſort, that I may heartily lament
theſe euils, and haue them pardoned
and taken from me, through Ieſus
Chriſt our Lord.
               Againe, good father, giue mee the
ſame thy holie ſpirit, to reueale to me
thy name, word and Goſpell, that I
may liuely know thee, vnfaynedlie

                  oue thee, heartilie obey thee, and aboue
all thinges deſire and labour by
all meanes lawfull, that all godlines
in doctrine and conuerſation may bee
exerciſed both in me and in all others
for whom thou wouldeſt I ſhoulde
praie.
               Here think vpon the ſtate of religion,
& the life of the profeſſors of the Goſpel,
that thou maiſt lament ſome, pray
for ſome, and giue thankes for ſome.
               
                  
Let thy kingdome come.
               THy Kingdome is in two fortes
to be conſidered:Gods kingdom in reſpect of his power. vniuerſally and
particularly, vniuerſally, according
to thy power, wherwith thou gouerneſt
al things euery where in earth,
heauen, hell, diuels, Angels, men,
beaſtes, foules, fiſhes and all other
creatures.
               Of this kingdome ſpake Dauid
when he ſaide: His kingdom ruleth
ouer all.
                  Pſal. 104 Particularly thy kingdome
is to be conſidered according to thy
grace, wherewith thou raigneſt onely
in thy Church & elect people,Gods kingdom in reſpect of his grace. ruling
and gouerning all and euerie member
of thy Church, to thy glorie and
their eternal comfort. Not that out
of this Church I exclude thy power,
(for as there with thou defendeſt
thy people, ſo thou puniſhed
                     •
                  
                  
thy enimies:) but becauſe thy grace
is ſpecially conſidered beeing (as it
were) the verie keeper that keepeth
and guideth thy people.Gods kingdom in reſpect of his glorie.
               
               The time will be when this kingdome
of grace and power, now being
as dinſtinct, ſhal be vnited and made
one kingdome of glorie: which will
be when Chriſt ſhall giue vp his
kingdome into thyne handes, that is,
in the reſurrection.Howe Gods kingdom is here conſidered and enlarged When death the
laſt enimie ſhall be ſubdued, and th
                     •••
                  
ſhalt be all in all.
               In the meane ſeaſon, this kingdome
of grace is miraculouſly and
mightiely propagated, enlarged, and
gonerned by the true Miniſterie of
thy woord and ſacramentes, through
the working of thy holy ſpirit: and
this is the meane and waie whereby,
as thou didſt firſt plant, ſo doeſt
thou enlarge, amplifie, and preſerue
the ſame.
               
                  
This kingdome of grace begunne,
continued, and inlarged by the true
preaching of thy Goſpell, and miniſtration
of thy Sacramentes, is the
thing which Chriſt teacheth here thy
children to pray for, that it might
come, that is to ſay, that thy Goſpel
might ſo mightily, purelie, and plenteouſlie
bee preached (maugre the
heade of all thine enemies) that the
number of thine electe might bee
brought in, and ſo the kingdome of
thy glorie might appeare. So that
as I ſee thy children deſire, pray, and
labour that thy Goſpell might bee
trulie preached, hearde, and liued in
themſelues and in others: ſo they
lament the not preaching and refuſing
the not lining and not beleeuing
thy Goſpell: yea, they lament the
lingring of ye comming of thy Chriſt:
for in his comming they know they
ſhall be like vnto him, and hauing

this hope, they purifie themſelues as
he is pure. By reaſon heereof I ſee,
firſt, that I am farre from this deſire
and lamenting, which thy children
haue: I ſee my ignorance of thy kingdome
and power euery where: alſo of
thy grace in thy Church only, and of
thy glory when al the enemies of thy
grace ſhal bee caſt downe, and thy
glorie and power ſhall embrace each
other. I ſee my ignorance, howe acceptable
a ſeruice to thee is the true
preaching, and the hearing of thy
Goſpel, for els thou hadſt not needed
to haue placed this petition next to
the petition of the ſanctifying of thy
name.
               Againe, I ſee heere mine vnableneeſſe
to enter into thy kingdome, and
to attaine to it: for els what neede
ſhoulde I haue to pray for that to
come from thee, which otherwiſe may
be atchieued?
               
                  
Thirdlye, I ſee my peruerſity and
contempt of thy kingdome & grace:
for although I ſee my want,Our peruerſitie. yet I
woulde not deſire thy kingdome to
come, if thou diddeſt not commande
me ſo to pray: and if I woulde haue
praied for it, thou wouldeſt not haue
commaunded me.
               Laſt of all,Gods goodnes. I ſee thy goodneſſe,
which wilt bring thy kingdome, and
that as generally, by ſending foorth
miniſters to preach truly: ſo particularlye,
by regenerating mee more
and more, and by giuing me as grace
heere, ſo glorie elſewhere: for thou
wouldeſt not I ſhould pray for that
which thou wilt denie.
               So that I haue great cauſe to lament
and reioice. To lament, becauſe
of my miſerable ſtate and condition,
becauſe of my ſinne, ignorance
rebellion, peruerſity, Sathans
power, contempt of thy grace, thy

Goſpell, and miniſtery here or elſewhere.
To reioice, becauſe of thy
goodneſſe & great mercie which haſt
brought me into thy Church, keepeſt
me in it, aud wilt do ſo ſtill. Alſo becauſe
of the miniſterie of thy word &
ſacramēacute;ts, by which the holy Ghoſt
is and will be effectuall: and finally
becauſe of the great glory whereunto
thou haſt called mee, and which
now thou wilt giue vnto mee aſking
the ſame.
               But alas how vnthankefull I am
and ſorrowleſſe, Lord thou knoweſt,
for my heart is not hid from thee. Oh
be merciful vnto me and forgiue me
good father, and gra
                     •
                  nt me the ſpirit
of thy children, to reueale vnto mee
my ignorance of thy kingdome, my
pouertie and peruerſitie, that I may
lament the ſame and daily labour
for thy helpe and thy holye ſpirite,
to ſuppreſſe the kingdome of

ſinne in my ſelfe and in others.
               Againe, graunt me that ſame thy
holie ſpirit to reueale to me thy kingdome
of power, grace and glorie, to
kindle mine affections, to regenerate
me more▪ and more to raigne in me as
a peece of thy kingdome, to giue to
me to deſire, to pray and to labour for
thy kingdome both to my ſelfe and to
others effectually to thy glorie, and to
aſſure my conſcience of thy goodnes
that thou wilt giue me grace & glorie,
&c.
               Here call to minde the ſtate of the
miniſtery and miniſters, the light and
life of Goſpellers,Gods omnipotent will vnknowen & vnreuealed the errors and hereſies
which men be intangled withall.
               Thy will be done.
               AS thy power is infinit, ſo is thy
wiſedome accordinglie.
               Whereby, as we may perceiue that
nothing is, or can bee done againſt

thy power, or otherwiſe than by it: ſo
is there not, nor cannot be any thing
done againſt, or otherwiſe then by
thy omnipotent and ſecret wil, which
is alwaies (as t
                     •
                  ou art) good, holie,
and iuſt, how farre ſo euer it ſeeme
otherwiſe to our fooliſhe reaſon and
iudgement: and therefore here we are
taught to pray that thy wil may bee
done here without ſinne on mans behalfe,
as it is on the Angels behalfe
in heauen.
               Againe, for as much as thou art
incomprehenſible of thy ſelfe, as well
concerning thy power,Gods wil reueled & knowen, as concerning
thy wiſdome: we may not according
thereto ſearch thee, but rather adore
and worſhip thy maieſtie, and tremble
at thy iudgments and works, and
therefore praie alwaies, we may bee
content with thy wil, and be buxomr
and obedient thereto.
               And for as much as thou haſt reuealed

vnto vs ſomuch of thy wil in
thy word writtenas is neceſſary for
vs in this life to knowe, yea, as wee
can attaine vnto, & a little further:
wee ought to take al things done againſt
the ſame, as

although thou canſt vſe the
ſame ſinne, to ſerue thy preuidence:
of the which prouidence we cannot,
nor may not iudge further than thou
haſt and ſhalt open it vnto vs.
               So that this petition, Thy wil be
done is not ſimply to be vnderſtoode
concerning thy omnipotent wil vnreuealed,
againſt the which nothing
is nor can be done, but rather concerning
thy will reuealed in the lawe
and Goſpell, the which thou heere
teacheſt mee, that wee ſhoulde deſire
not onely to know it, but alſo to do it,
and that in ſuch perfection and willingneſſe,
as it is in heauen. The
which thing I perceiue hereby, that

thy children doe deſire daily in and
for themſelues and othrs, and doe la
ment the contrarie,Pſal. 1

it be ſo that often their eies guſh
out with riuers of teares, becauſe
men keepe not thy lawes.
               By reaſon hereof I ſee that I am
far from the ſighes and teares of thy
people. I ſee my ignorance of thy wil
if thou hadſt not opened the ſame by
thine owne mouth.Our ign

how acceptable a ſeruice obedience
to thy wil is, and therefore do
eſt thou place this petition amonge
the firſt and continuall deſires of thy
children.
               Againe, I ſee my pouertie in godlie
obedience,Our neceſſitie. which had neede to be
taught to praie for it, therby to ſignifie
vnto me my want & vnability to
attaine it but by thy gift.
               Thirdlye,Our diſo
                        •
                     bedienc I ſee my diſobedience
for elſe neuer wouldeſt thou haue

commanded me to haue praier for the
doing of thy holy wit, if I ſeeing my
want,Gods goodnes would haue prayed ſo.
               Laſt of all, I ſee thy goodneſſe,
which wilt giue to me, and others,
to obey thy will, that is, to loue thee
with al our harts, to loue our neighbor
as our ſelues, to dy to our ſelues,
to liue to thee, to take by our croſſe,
and to followe thee, to beleeue, to repent,
&c. for els thou wouldeſt neuer
haue bidden vs to pray for a thinge
which we ſhould not looke for.
               So that I haue great cauſe to lament
and reioyce. To lament becauſe
of my miſerable eſtate and condition,
becauſe of my ſinne, ignorance, pouertie,
and peruerſitie: and becauſe thy
will is euery wher either not known
or contemned, and Sathans wil, the
will of the world and of the fleſh, readily
obeied.
               To reioice I haue great cauſe, for

that thou haſt opened thy ſelfe & will
vnto mankind: for that alſo thou peculiarlie
haſt taught me theſe things
& becauſe thou wilt graunt me grace
to doe the ſame. But alas, how vnthankfull
I am, and how hard hearted
thou Lord doeſt know.
               Oh be mercifull vnto me, and forgiue
me: I beſeeche thee, gracious
God. Graunt me thy holie ſpirit, to
reueale to mee my ingnorance of thy
will, my pouerty & peruerſitie, that
I may heartilie be watle it, &c. and by
the helpe and working of the ſame
ſpirit, may ſuppreſſe the wil of the
fleſhe. Againe, graunt mee thy holie
ſpirit, to reueale to mee thy wil declared
in thy lawe and Goſpell, that I
may trulie knowe the ſame, and inflame
ſo my affections, that I may
wil and loue the ſame in ſuch ſorte,
that it may be my meat and drinke to
doe thy wil.
               
                  
Heere call to mind the ten commandementes
of God particularlie or generally,
what therein herequireth, and
praie for the ſame particularlie as you
ſee your neede, and that not onelie for
your ſelfe, but alſo for others.
               Praie for patience to ſuffer what
croſſe ſoeuer God ſhall lay vpon, and
pray for them that be vnder the croſſe,
that they may be patient: praie for ſpirituall
wiſedome in euery croſſe peculiar
or publike, that you maye ſee and
loue Gods will.
               Giue vs this day our daily bread.
               BY Bread the foode of the body,Bread. are

&c.Giue.
               
               By this worde Giue, wee ſhoulde
vnderſtand, that not onely ſpirtuall
thinges, but alſo corporall benefites

are Gods free gifts, a come not for
our worthines or trauel taken about
the ſame although our trauels be of
tentimes meanes, by the which God
doth giue corporall things.Dailie.
               
               By daylie we vnderſtand the contented
mindes of thy children, with
that which is ſufficient for the preſēt
time as hauing hope in thee that
they ſhall not want, but daily ſhall
receiue at thy handes plentie and inough
of all thinges.
               By this word Our,
                  Our. are as wel vnderſtood
publike benefites, as peace
in the common weale, good Magiſtrates,
good lawes, reaſonable weather.
&c. alſo particular benefites,
namely children, helth, ſucces in the
workes of our vocation, &c. And beſides
this, by it wee ſhoulde ſee the
care, euen for corporal things which
thy children haue for others, as wel
as for themſelues.
               
                  
So that heere I may learne how
farre I am from that I ſhoulde bee,
and that I ſee thy children are come
vnto. I ſee my ignorance alſo, howe
that, as ſpirituall thinges do come
from thee, ſo doe temporall thinges:
and as they come from thee: ſo are
they conſerued and kept of thee: and
therefore thy children are thankefull
and look for them as thy meer gifts,
notwithſtanding the meanes which
they vſe if they haue them: howbeit
they vſe them but as meanes, for except
thou worke therewith,Pſal. 127 all is in
vaine.
               Againe, heere I am taught to bee
content with that which is ſufficient
for the preſent time, as thy children
bee, which haue the ſhortneſſe of this
life alwayes before their eyes: and
therfore they aſke but for dailie ſuſtenance,
knowing this life to be compared
to a day, pea a watch, a ſound▪
                  
a ſhadow, &c.
               Moreouer, I may learn to ſee the
compaſſion and brotherly care which
thy children haue one for another,
Laſt of all, heere I may ſee thy goodneſſe,
which as thou wilt giue me all
things neceſſarie for this life (or els
thou wouldeſt not bid me aſke, &c.)
ſo thou commandeſt all men to pray
and care for mee, and that bodily,
much more then, if they be able, they
are commanded to help mee both in
body and ſoule.
               By reaſon wherof I haue greate
cauſe to lament and reioyce. To lament,
becauſe I am not ſo affected
as thy children be, becauſe of my ignorance,
my ingratitude, my peruerſitie
and contempt of all goodnes, and
of the neceſſitie of thy people, which
(alas) be in great miſerie, ſome in ex

To reioice I haue great cauſe,
becauſe of thy goodnes in teaching
mee theſe things, in commaunding
mee to aſke whatſoeuer I want, in
giuing me ſo many thinges vnaſked
in keeping the benefites giuen me, in
commaunding men to care for me, to
pray for me, to helpe me, &c.
               But alas, how far I am either frō
true lamenting or reioycing, Lorde
thou knoweſt. Oh be merciful vnto
mee, and helpe mee, forgiue mee, and
grant me thy holie ſpirite to reueale
to mee my neede, ignorance, great in
gratitude and contempt of thy mercies
& thy people, & that in ſuch ſort,
that I might hartely lament and be
wail my miſery, & through thy goodneſſe
bee altered with thy people, to
mourne for the miſeries of thy children,
as for mine owne,
               Againe, reueale to mee thy goodneſſe,
deare father, euen in corporall

thinges, that I may ſee thy mercye,

truely to reuerence, feare, loue,
and obey thee, to hang vpon thee, to
bee thankfull to thee, in all my
neede to come vnto thee, not onelye
when I haue ordinarie meanes, by
the which thou commonly woorkeſt
but alſo when I haue none, yea,
when all meanes & helps are cleane
againſt me.

children and family: alſo your parents,
neighbors, kinsfolks: alſo your friends,

the forgiuing our treſpaſſes is (as
it were) a ſacrament vnto vs.
               So that by this petition I am
taught to ſee that thy children, although
by imputation they bee pure
from ſinne, yet they acknowledge ſin
to be and remayne in them, and therfore
doe they pray for the remiſſion
and forgiueneſſe of the ſame.
               Againe, I am taught heereby to
ſee how thy children do conſider and
take to heart: not onely the euils they
doe, but alſo the good they leaue vndoone:
and therefore they pray thee
heartily for pardon.
               Moreouer, I am heere taught is
for that thy children are careful for other
men, and for their treſpaſſes, and
therfore pray that they might be pardoned
in ſaying: Our ſinnes, and not
my ſinnes.
               Beſides this, I am taught heere

to ſee how thy children not onlie
forgiue all thoſe that offende them,
but alſo pray for the pardoning of the
offences of their enimies, and ſuch
as offend them: So farre are they
from maliciouſneſſe pride, reuengement,
&c.
               Laſt of al, I am taught to ſee how
mercifull thou art, which will haue
vs to aſke pardon (wherof thou woldeſt
that we ſhould in no point doubt
but be moſt aſſured, that for Chriſts
ſake thou heareſt vs) and that not only
for our ſelues, but alſo for many others:
for thou doeſt not commaunde
vs to aſke for any thing which thou
wilt not giue vs.
               By reaſon whereof I haue greate
cauſe to lament and reioyce. To lament,
becauſe of my miſerable eſtate,
which am ſo farre from theſe affections
that are in thy children: which
am ſo ignorant and careleſſe of ſinne,

not onely in leauing good vndone, but
alſo in doing euil, and that daily, in
thought, word and deede▪ &c. I ſpeak
not of my careleſnes for other folkes
ſinnes, as of my parents, children,
family, magiſtrates, &c., neither of the
ſinnes of them to whom I haue giuen

               To reioyce I haue greate cauſe,
becauſe of thy mercie in opening to
mee theſe things, in commaunding me
to pray for pardon, in promiſing mee
pardon, and commanding others to
pray for mee. And ſurely I ought to
be perſwaded of thy mercie, though
my ſinnes be innumerable: for I ſee
not only in this, but in euery petition,
how that euery one of the Church
praieth for mee, yea Chriſt thy ſonne,
who ſitteth on th right hand, praieth
for me &c.
               Oh dearey father, be merciful vnto
me, and forgiue me all my ſinnes, and

of thy goodneſſe giue mee thy holie
ſpirite to open mine eies, that I
may ſee ſinne, the better to knowe it,
the more truelie to hate it, and moſt
earneſtlie to ſtriue againſt it, and
that effectually, both in my ſelfe and
others.
               Againe, graunte mee the ſame thy
holy ſpirite, to reueale vnto mee the
remedy of ſinne. By Chriſt onlie, and
to worke in mee faith to imbrace the

                     •
                  ame by Chriſte, and thy mercies in
him, that I may henceforth be indued
with thy holy ſpirite, to beginne to
obey thy good will more and more,
and to increaſe in the ſame for euer.
               Heere call to minde the ſpecial ſins
you haue committed heeretofore. Remember,
if you haue occaſioned
anie to ſinne, to praie for them by
name. Remember that Gods lawe
ſhoulde bee ſo deare vnto vs, that the
breaking thereof in others, ſhoulde be

an occaſion to make vs to lament with
teares, &c.
               Leade vs not into temptation.
               BEcauſe of our continuall & great
infirmities: becauſe of the greate
diligence and ſubtilties of our enemies:
and becauſe thou art wont to
puniſh ſinne with ſinne (which of
all puniſhmentes is the greateſt and
moſt to bee feared) in this petition
thou wouldeſt haue thy children to
haue the ſame in remembrance, and
for a remedie heereof thou haſt appoynted
praier, ſo that the only cauſe
why anie are ouercome and led into
temptation, to ſee that they forget
what they deſire in the petition going
before this, which ſhould neuer
be out of their memorie, to prouoke
them to bee more thankefull to thee,
and more vigilant and heedy heereafter
for falling into the like perils.
               
                  
For which to be auoyded, thou doſt
moſt gratiouſly ſet forth a remedy, in
commaunding vs to pray ofter pardon
for our ſinnes paſt, and for thy
grace to guide vs ſo that wee be not
lid into temptation, but might be deliuered
from euil. And becauſe thou
wouldeſt haue all thy children to
hang wholy vpon thee, to feare thee
only, and ouly to loue thee, noht doſt
not teach thē to pray. Suffer vs not
to be led, but lead vs not into temptation,
that (I ſay) they might only
feare thee, and certainly know that
Sathan hath no power ouerſo much
as a pigge, but whatſoeuer thou giueſt
vnto him, and of thy ſecrete, but
moſt iuſt iudgment doeſt appointe
him to vſe, not as hee will (for then
wee were all loſt) but as thou wilt,
which canſt will nothing, but that
which is moſt iuſt: as to giue them
to the guiding of ſathan, which will

not be guided by thy grace, as then
diddeſt Saul, &c.
               Occaſions to euil are in two
ſorts:Occaōſis to euil in two ſorts One by proſperitie and ſucceſſe:
an other by aduerſitie and the
croſſe, &c. The euils coming of ſucceſſe,
commonly are vnthankfulnes,
pride, ſecuritie, and forgetting of our
ſelues, forgetting of others, forgetfulneſſe
of God, of our mortalitie, &c.
The euls comming of aduerſitie,
commonly are impatiencie, murmuring,
grudging,VVhat tentations are to the go
                        •
                     ly, & what they are to the wicked. diſpairing, contemning
of God, flattering of men, ſtealing,
lying, with many other euils,
whereto tentations will intice a
man that is left to himſelfe: whereas
to one that is guided with Gods
ſpirit, temptations are but trials to
the glorie of GOD: comfort of the
tempted, and edyf
                     •
                  ing of thy Church.
But (as I ſaide) if a man bee
left alone, tentations entice euen to

the diuel himſelfe: and therefore
thy children praye to bee deliuered
from euill, vnderſtanding thereby
Sathan himſelfe, the ſower of and
ſupporter of all euill. And this thy
children do as well for others, as for
themſelues. So that I may learne
heereby many good thinges: Firſt to
remember often our infirmitie and
weakeneſſe, & the daungerous eſtate
wee ſtand in, in reſpect of our fleſhe,
of the worlde which is full of euil, of
Sathan which ſeeketh to ſift vs, and
as a roaring Lion to deſtroy vs, and
of our ſinnes which deſerue al kinde
of puniſhments and correction, that
I might with thy children feare
thee, watch, pray, and deſire the daye
of redemption and deliueraunce from
all euils.
               Againe, I may learne heere, that
to auoide all daungers and euils, is
not in the power of man, but onelie

thy worke. By reaſon whereof, I
ſhoulde conſider thy great goodneſſe,
which hitherto haſt kept me from ſo
many euils both of ſoule and bodie,
yea of name, goods, &c. as thou haſt
doone in my infancie, childhood, youth
middle age, &c.
               Thirdly, I may learne heere that
I ſhould bee careful for others, both
that they might bee deliuered from
their euils, and that they might bee
preſerued from temptation, and from
being ouercome in the ſame, and th
                     •
                  rfore
thou teacheſt me not to pray, Deliuer
me from euil ſimplie, but, Deliuer
vs from euiil.
               Laſt of all, I am taught thereby to
ſee thy goodnes towards me, which
will deliuer mee from euill, and
from being ouercome in tentations:
for thou wouldeſt not haue mee aſke
for that which I ſhould not certainly
looke for at thy handes. By reaſon

whereof thou wouldeſt haue mee to
bee in a certainety of my ſaluation for
euer. For elſe I cannot beleeue my
prayer to bee heard, if that finally I
ſhoulde not bee deliuered from euill:
and therefore thou ioyneſt hereto
a giuing of thanks, which with thy
Church I ſhould ſay: For thine is the
kingdome, thine is the power, thine is
the glorie, for euer.
               
               By reaſon whereof I haue great

I am altogether careleſſe and

weakenes, perils, dangers,
c. in ſuch ſort, that as I may heartily
lament my miſeries, ſo I may
aſke and obtaine thy grace to guide
me from all euill for euermore.
               Againe, grant mee the ſame thy

vigilancie: our negligence, his
diligence: our infirmitie, his abilitie:
our ignorance, his craft and ſubtiltie
&c.
               Againe, call to minde, howe that he
hath ouerthrowne for a time, many of
the deare ſaintes of God, to whom we
are to be compared in nothing, as Adá
Eue, Lot, Iudas, Thamar, Moſes, Aaron,
Myrian, Samſon, Gedeon, Ely, Dauid,
Solomon, Ezechias, Ioſias, Peter, Thomas
and innumerable moe.
               Alſo call to minde the goodneſſe of
God, and of our ſheepehearde Chriſt,
which hath kept vs hitherto, keepeth
vs ſtill, and teacheth vs heere to know
that hee will keepe vs for euer: for hee
woulde not haue vs aske for deliuerance
from euil, if that hee would not

wee ſhoulde certainely looke for the
ſame. If thou doubt of ſmall perſeuerance,
thou diſhonoureſt God. Bee
certaine therefore, reſt in hope, bee
ſtill in his worde. See alſo how he hath
commmaunded his whole church, and
euery member thereof, to pray for thee
all well as for themſelues, in theſe and
all other thinges.
               Nowe and then goe about to recken
how many and diuerſe kindes of euils
there bee, and thereby as you may
know you are deliuered from none but
by Gods greate goodneſſe: ſo may you
ſee that the number of euils, that you
haue, are nothing to bee compared to
the multitude of euils, wherewith if
your Chriſt were not, the diuel would
all to beray you, infect and corrupt you.
               But what are all the miſeries and euils
that can bee, to be compared to

                     •
                  he leaſt ioy prepared for vs in heauen?
Oh thinke of thoſe ioyes, and pray

that when the tide of death commeth
we may hale forth of the haueh of this
fleſh, and this world ioyfully.
               In praying this petition, call to
minde the euils you haue beene in, the
euil, you are in, and the euils you may
fall into, if God ſhoulde not preſerue
you, that you might be ſtirred vp the
more to thankefulneſſe, to prayer, to
truſt in God.
               For thine is the kingdom, thine is
the power, thine is the glory, for
euer.
               AS in the beginning of this prayer

to thy good wil through Ieſus Chriſt

thy deare ſonne our Lords and only
Sauiour.
               By reaſon whereof I haue greate
cauſe to lament and reioyce. To lament,
becauſe I conſider not theſe
thinges in prayer, in ſuch ſorte as
ſhould moue mee to admiration, and
gratitude: becauſe I conſider not thy
power and wiſedome generally in all
things: becauſe I am ſo careleſſe for
thy kingdome, and becauſe I am ſo
full of dubitation and doubting of
thy goodneſſe. To reioyce I haue
great cauſe: becauſe thou reuealeſt
theſe things vnto me on this ſorte:
becauſe of thy power, kingdome and
glorie, which maketh to the hearing
of my prayers, and helping of mee,
becauſe thou wilt vſe me as thine inſtrument
to ſet forth thy kingdome,
power, and glorie: and becauſe i
                     •
                  
pleaſeth thee to heare my prayer
and aſſuredly wilt ſaue mee for euer.
               
                  
But alas howe farre am I from
theſe lamentings and reioycinges?
By reaſon whereof I deſerue damnation.
O bee mercifull vnto mee,
and forgiue me, and of thy goodneſſe
grant me thy holy ſpirite, to reueale
to mee my blindnes, obliuion, & contempt
of thy kingdome, power, and
glore, with the greatnes of my doubtings,
that as I may heartily, lamēt
them, ſo haue them pardoned & taken
from mee, through the merites
of Ieſus Chriſt thy ſonne.
               Againe, giue me thy holy ſpirit to
reueale to me in ſuch ſort, thy kingdome,
power, glorie, & eternitie, that
I may alwaies haue the ſame before

haue the fruition thereof after this
life ſo to increaſe in an aſſured, certaine,

Inflame my hart with the therof,

                     Thinke firſt that man conſiſteth of
ſoule & body, & that the ſoule is from
heauen heauenly, firm and immortall,
but the body is from the earth earthly,
fraile and mortall.
                     Againe, thinke that though by reaſon
of ſinne wherein you are conceyued
and borne, the partes of the ſoule
which do vnderſtande and deſire, bee
ſo corrupt, that without ſpeciall grace
to both partes you can neither know
nor loue anie good thing in Gods
ſight, much leſſe then doe that is
good: yet this notwithſtanding,
thinke that you are regenerate by
CHRISTES reſurrection, (which
your Baptiſme requireth you to beleeue)
and therefore haue both thoſe

partes ſome thing reformed, both to
knowe, and to loue, and therefore, to
doe alſo ſome good in the ſight of God
through Chriſt, for whoſe ſake our
poore doings are accepted for good,
the euil and infirmitie cleauing therevnto,
not beeing imputed through
faith.
                     Thinke that by faith, which is Gods
ſeede (for they which beleefe we are
borne of GOD, and made Gods children)
giuen to thoſe that bee ordayned
to eternall life: thinke (I ſay) that by
faith you receiue more and more the
ſpirite of ſanctification, through the vſe
of Gods worde and ſacramentes, and
earneſt prayer, to illuminate your
mindes, vnderſtanding, iudgement
and reaſon, and to bowe, forme, frame,
and inflame your affections with loue
and power to doe that which is good, &
therefore vſe you the meanes aforeſaid
accordinglie.
                     
                        
Thinke that by this ſpirite, you are
through fayth coupled to Chriſt, as a
liuelie member, and ſo to God, and (as
it were) made one with him: and by
loue, which ſpringeth out of this faith,
you are made one alſo with al that be
of God, and ſo you haue fellowſhippe
with GOD and all good men that euer
were or ſhall be, in al the good that
God and all his ſaintes haue or ſhall
haue.
                     Thinke that as by faith, and loue
through the ſpirite of GOD you are
now entred into his communion (the
bleſſedneſſe wherof no tongue can expreſſe)
ſo after this life, you ſhall firſt
in ſoule, and in the laſt day in body alſo
enioy for euer the ſame ſociety moſt
perfectly, which nowe is but begunne
in you.
                     Thinke then of your negligence, that
doe ſo little care for this your happie
eſtate.
                     
                        
Thinke vpon your ingratitude to
God, for making you, redeeming you,
calling you, and ſolouingly adopting
you.
                     Thinke vpon your folly in fantaſing
ſo much earthly and bodily pleaſures.
                     Thinke vpon your dea
                           •
                        nee & blindnes,
which heare not God nor ſee him
he calling you ſo diligently by his works
word, and ſacraments.
                     Thinke vpon your frowardnes which
will not be lead of God, and his ſpirit.
                     Thinke vpon your forgetfulneſſe and
in conſideration of your heauenly eſtate,
how your bodie is the temple of
the holy Ghoſt, your members are the
members of Chriſt, the whole world,
and all things there in are your owne.
Therefore ſay vnto your ſoule, O my
ſoule, ariſe, follow God contemne this
world, purpoſe well and purſue it long
for the

And forſomuch as you muſt liue
to Gods pleaſure, ſee the vocation and
ſtate of your life wherevnto God hath
called you, and pray to God for grace,
knowledge & abilitie, to take the moſt
profitable things in hand, wel to begin,
better to go on, and beſt of all to ende
the ſame, to Gods glorie, & to the profite
of your brethren, and thinke that
time loſt wherein you ſpeake not, or do
not, or at the leaſt thinke not ſomthing
to Gods glorie, and the commoditie
of your brethren.

                     I Conſider, howe vainelie the moſte
part of men are occupied: howe many
waies they trouble and cumber themſelues,
thereby much alienating their
mindes from the knowledge and cogitation
of that which they ſhoulde
moſt eſteeme, and ſo become a let
and an offence to others. As in going

abroad you will ſee that your apparell
bee ſeemely in the ſight of men:Iohn 6 Iohn. 4 ſo ſee
how ſeemely you appeare in the ſight

                  MErcifull father, thou art wont
to ſend to thy ſeruants and men
of ſimple heartes) thine Angels to be
their keepers & (as it were) guids,
as elder brother to watch vpon thy
weake children: So diddeſt thou to
yong Tobias, to Iacob, to Abrahams

                     Thinke ſome thing howe wee are
ſtraungers from our countrie, from
our home, from our originall, I meane
from God▪ againe, thinke vpon our

alſo how fooliſh wee are to
fantaſie thinges which we cannot carrie
with vs, and to condemne conſcience,
which will alwaies be a companien
to vs, to our ioy, if it bee good but
to our ſhame and ſorrowe, if it be euill

we are, which ſo litle deſire to

maſter, fellowes, and friends.
                  
               
               
                  When you are about to receiue your
meat, praie thus.
                  THis is a wonderfull myſtery of
thy worke (O maker and gouernour
of the world) that thou doeſt
ſuſtaine the liues of men and beaſtes
with theſe meates. Surely this power
is neither in the bread nor foode,
but in thy will and worde, by which
worde all things do liue & haue their
being. Againe, howe great a thing is
it that thou art able continually to
giue ſuſtenance to ſo many creatures
This is ſpoken of by the Prophet in
ſetting forth thy praiſes: All thinges
looke vp to thee,

Theſe doubtleſſe are wonderfull
workes of thine almightineſſe. I
therefore heartily pray thee (O moſt
liberal Lord and faithful father) that
as thou by meate, through thy word
doſt miniſter life to theſe our bodies,
euen ſo by the ſame word, with thy

we may pleaſe thee, til this our mortall

will be all in all.

                     Think a little how great Gods power
is that made vs. Alſo thinke howe

greate his wiſedome is to preſerue vs.

art ſo. Then ſhall we not turne that

thou haſt giuen for the medicine of

thankefully, we ſhall finde them profitable,
both in ſoule and bodie.
                  
                     Occaſions to meditate.
                     Thinke that the meates and drinks
ſet before you, are giuen to you to vſe
& not to abuſe. Thinke that they are
giuen to profite and not to hurte you.
Thinke that they are not giuen to you
alone but vnto others alſo by you. In
eating and drinking thinke that you
doe but feede the wormes. Remember
the poore priſoners, the ſicke, the afflicted,
&c. as though you were in their
caſe.
                     
                        
Thinke vpon the food of your ſoule,

                  BY corporall meates thou doeſt
ſuſtaine our corporall daily life,
readie otherwiſe to periſh. The
which ſurely is a great worke: but
yet this is much greater, more profitable
aud more holie, that thy grace
(O Ieſu Chriſt) dooth preſerue vs
from the death of the ſoule. For this
life wee ought much to thanke thee:
and becauſe thou dorſt prolonge it
with thy good giftes we moſt heartilie
praiſe thee. How be it this life
is but the way to eternall life, which
wee beſeech thee for thy deathes ſake
that thou wilt giue vs, and ſo ſhall
we not onely giue thee (as wee may)

thankes for a time, for temporall
things: but alſo eternall thanks for
eternall things. O grant to vs theſe
our deſires, for thy mercies ſake

thee this his bleſſing of foode and ſuſtenance
and thereto time, that thou
mighteſt, as repent, ſo ſeeke his glory,
and the commoditie of thy brethren:
therefore goe there abouts: but firſt
pray for grace well to beginne. Againe,
conſider how thou haſt beene partaker
of other mens labours, as of the Huſbandmans,
the Milners, the Bakers,
the Bruers, the Butchers, the Cookes,
&c. See therefore that thou bee not as
a drone Bee, but rather ſuch a one as
may helpe the hiue. If God haue thus
fed thy body which he loueth not, but
for thy ſoules ſake: howe can it bee

then, but that hee will bee much more
ready to feed the ſoule: Therfore take
a courage to thee, and goe to him for
grace accordingly.

midday.
                     As thy bodie is nowe compaſſed on
euery ſide with light, ſo ſee that thy
mind may be alſo. As God giueth thee
thus plentifullie this corporall lighte,
ſo pray him that hee will giue thee the
ſpirituall life. Thinke that as the
Sunne is nowe moſt cleare, ſo ſhal our
bodies be in the day of Iudgement. As
now the Sunne is come to the higheſt,
and therefore will beginne to drawe
downeward: ſo is there nothing in the
worlde ſo perfect and glorious, which
when it is at the full, will not decreaſe
and ſo weare away.
                  
               
               
                  
                  When you come home againe,
pray.
                  THere is nothing (O Lord) more
like to thy holy nature, than a
quiet minde. Thou haſt called vs
out of the troubleſome diſquietneſſe
of the world, into that thy quiet reſt
and peace, which the world can not
giue being ſuch a peace as paſſeth all

mercie my body may enter into this

merrie a returne it will bee to come
to our eternall, moſt quiet, and moſt
happie home, then will all griefe and
ſorrow ceaſe. Whatſoeuer here is pleaſant
and ioyfull, the ſame is nothing

Thy ſunne (O moſt wiſe worker)

light commeth both to the ſoule and

God giueth vnto vs by the candle light
(whereby wee ſee thoſe things in this
night of our bodies which are expedient
for vs) ſhoulde make vs to wiſh
much more for this doctrine of God
& ſpirituall light of our ſoules, & when
wee get it, the more to eſteeme it, and
diligently to embrace it. Againe, that

                  THis our life and weake-knit bodie
by occaſion of ſin, by little &
little ſhall be diſſolued, and ſo ſhal be
reſtored to the earth from whence it
was taken: then will be an end of
this vanitie, which by our folly wee
haue wrought to our ſelues. O moſt
meek father, ſo do thou vnite me (for
thou art he that hath knit theſe our
weak members together) that I may
perceiue my ſelfe to be looſed and diſſolued,
and ſo may remember both of
whome I was made, & alſo whither
I muſt goe, leaſt I be had vnprouided
vnto thy tribunall ſeat.

                     Thinke that wee doe willinglie put
off our garments, becauſe wee ſhall receiue
them againe when the night is
paſt: ſo we ſhould willingly forſake our

becauſe we ſhall receiue them againe,

O Lorde our keeper and defender,
graunt that I now laing me downe

and body may be kept pure and holie
for euer.
                  I will lay mee downe in peace, and
take my reſt, &c. Pſal. 4.
                  
                     Occaſions to meditate.
                     Thinke that as the troubleſome day
is nowe paſt, and night come, and ſo
reſt, quietneſſe, and pleaſant ſleepe,
which maketh moſt excellent princes

We finde in our ſelues nothing,
but ignorance of thy wil, diſobedience,
miſtruſt, doubtfulneſſe in
thy goodneſ, and incredulitie, hatred,
and contempt of all ſpiritual things
ſelfeloue, confidence in our ſelues, &
feruent luſting after carnall thinges
of this worlde: and this tree of our
corrupt nature, bringeth forth continually

rotten and vnſauorie workes of the

                  A prayer to be ſaid in the
Morning.
                  
                     O Eternall GOD and heauenly
Father, ſeeing that by thy great
mercie we haue quietly paſſed this
night, graunt we beſeech thee that
we may beſtowe this day wholy in
thy ſeruice, ſo that all our thoughts,
wordes and deedes, may redounde to
the glorie of thy name, and good example
of our brethren. And as it
hath pleaſed thee to make the Sun

to ſhine vpon the earth, to giue vs
bodily light: euen ſo vouchſafe to illuminate
our vnderſtanding with
the brightneſſe of thy ſpirit, to direct
vs in the way ofrighteouſnes, ſo that
what thing ſo euer wee ſhall applie
our ſelues vnto, our ſpeciall care and
purpoſe may be to walke in thy feare,
and to ſerue and honor thee, looking
for all our wealth and proſperitie, to
come from thy onely bleſſing, & that
we may take nothing in hand, which
ſhal not be agreeable to thy moſt bleſſed
will.
                  Furthermore, that we may in ſuch
ſort trauail for our bodies, and for
this preſent life, that wee may haue
alwaies a further regard: that is, to
the heauenly life, which thou haſt
promiſed to thy children: and in the
in meane ſeaſone, that it way pleaſe thee
to preſerue and defende vs both i
                        •
                     
body and ſoule, to ſtrengthen vs

againſt all the temptations of the diuell,
and to deliuer vs from all perils
and daungers that may happen vnto
vs, if we be not defended by thy godly
power.
                  And for as much as to begin wel,
and not to continue, is nothing: wee
beſeech thee to receiue vs not onelie
this day, into thy holy protection,
but alſo for the time of our whole
life, continuing and increaſing in
vs daily thy good grace & gifts thereof,
vntill thou ſhalt bring vs to that
happy ſtate, where wee ſhall fully &
for euer bee ioyned vnto thy Sonne
Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, which
is y• true light of our ſoules, ſhining
day and night perpetually.
                  And to the ende that we may obtaine
ſuch grace at thy hand▪ vouchſafe
(moſt mercifull Father) to forgiue
and forget all our ſinnes, which
wee haue heeretofore committed againſt

thee, & for thine infinite mercies
ſake to pardon the ſame, as thou
haſt promiſed to thoſe that aſke of
thee with vnfained heart, for whom,
as for our ſelues we make our humble
petitions vnto thee in the name
of thy ſonne our Lord & Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt, in ſuch ſorte, as he hath
taught vs ſaying: Our Father, &c.
                  
               
               
                  Another praier to be ſaide in
the Morning.
                  
                     O Almightie and moſt gratious
God, we heartely thank thee for
the ſweete ſleepe and comfortable
reſt, which thou haſt giuen vs this
night past: and foraſmuch as thou
haſt commanded by thy holy worde
that no man ſhould bee idle, but all
occupied in godly and vertuous exerciſes,
euery man according to his
calling: wee moſt humblie beſeeche
thee, that thine eies may attende vpon

vs, daily defend vs, cheriſh, comfort,
gouerne vs, and al our counſels,
ſtudies and labors, in ſuch wiſe that
wee may ſpend and beſtow this daie
according to thy moſt holy will, ſeting
thee alwaies before our eyes, liuing
in thy feare, working that may
be found acceptable before thy diuine
maieſtie, through Ieſus Chriſt our
Lord, So be it.
               
               
                  Another prayer for the
Morning
                  VVE humbly and heartily giue
thanks vnto thee (O heauenly
Father) through thy deerely beloued
ſon Ieſus Chriſt, that to thy
innumerable benefits, hither to powred
vpon our ſoules, and vppon
our bodies, thou haſt kept vs this
night paſt from manie euils, both
ſpirituall and corporall, and 
                        〈◊〉
                      of
thy mercie doeſt offer & giue vs time

to repent and amende our liues, ſo
that we might liue henceforth, not
as we will, but as thou wilt: and as
our bodies do draw continually neerer
& neerer their ende (the graue I
meane:) ſo our ſoules might approch
to their end, that is, heauen & not hel:
for in one ſtate we ſtand not ſtill, but
either we are neerer y• neerer & happie
ſtate of life, or elſe the vnhappie
condition of death eternall.
                  Wherefore wee beſeech thee to be
mercifull vnto vs good Father, and
as of thy goodneſſe thou giueſt vs
time to repent and liue godlie, ſo of ye
ſame thy goodneſſe in Chriſte, wee
humbly beſeech thee to giue vs thy
gracious gift of true, holy, perfect, &
perpetuall repentance, that we may
more and more lamente our former
ſinnefull life, truſting vnfainedly in
thy rich mercie, through the merites
of Ieſus Chriſt, for the pardon of

all 
                        •
                     ur ſinnes, and that wee may vnfainedly
purpoſe, and effectually labour
to amend our liues this day, &
ſo long as wee haue to liue. in all our
doings and wordes, and euen in our
verie thoughtes, to the prayſe of thy
holy name, and good example of our
doings and words, and euen in our
brethren.
                  And for as much as thou knoweſt
our weakeneſſe, our ignorance, and
great vntowardneſſe, to carrie anie
great croſſe or affliction: wee beſeech
thee our ſweete Father, ſo temper
and order all things towards vs this
day and for euer, that we bee neuer
further proued & tempted, than thou
wilt make vs able to beare, and ſo to
helpe vs in the ſame, as may be moſt

                        〈◊〉
                      thy glorie & our ſaluation, through

                     O Lord God Father euerlaſting,
and full of pitie, wee acknowledge

the obedience and death of thy ſonne

for all our ſinnes.
                  Haue mercie therefore vpon vs
(O Lorde) and forgiue vs our offences,
Teach vs by thy holy ſpirit that
we may rightly weigh them,Pſ. 9. 10 & earneſtly
repent vs for the ſame: and ſo
much the rather (O Lord our God)

becauſe that the reprobate,Pſal. 8. & ſuch as
thou haſt forſakē,Pſal. 5 cānot prayſe thee,
nor cal vpō thy name: but the repenting
heart, the ſorrowfnl minde, the

forth thy praiſe and glorie.
                  And albeit we be but wormes and

art our father,1. Co. 6 & we thy childrē: thou
art our ſhepheard, and we thy flocke:
thou art our redeemer,Iere. 10. and wee thy

bought:Pſal. 6. thou art our God, and wee
are thine inheritance.
                  Correct vs not therefore in thine
anger (O Lord our God) neither according
to our deſertes doe thou puniſh
vs,Eccl. 18 but mercifully chaſtice vs
with a fatherly affection, that all the

                  Finally, foraſmuch as it hath pleaſed
thee to make the night for man

that they cannot abide impietie: thou
ſearcheſt the hearts, and trieſt the

iniquitie.
                  
                     
For ſinnes ſake thou haſt greeuouſly
puniſhed mākinde, thy moſt deare
creature, as thou haſt declared by the
penalty of death laide vpon all the
children of Adam: by the caſting of
Adam and his ofſpring out of Paradiſe:
by the curſing of the earth: by the
drowning of the worlde: by the burning
of Sodom and Gomor: by hardening
the heart of Pharao, ſo that no
miracle could conuert him: by the
drowning of him and his people in

the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, ſo
that of fire hundreth thouſand there

Salomon in himſelfe and his

                      ſpectacles of thy anger
againſt ſinne, the greateſt and moſt
notable is the death and bloudie paſſion
of thy dearely beloued Sonne
Ieſu Chriſt. Great was thine anger
againſt ſinne, when in heauen & earth
nothing could be found which might
appeaſe thy wrath, ſaue the bloudſhedding
of thine onely & moſt dearely
beloued ſonne, in whom, was and
is all thy delight. Great was the ſore
of ſinne that needed ſuch a ſalue:
mightie was the maladie, that needed
ſuch a medicine. If in Chriſt, in
whome was no ſin, thy wrath was
ſo fierce for our ſins that he was conſtrayned
to cry: My God, my God, why
haſt thou forſaken me? How great &
importable then is thine anger againſt

vs, which art nothing but ſinfull?
They that are thy children,
through the contemplation of thine
anger againſt ſinne, ſet forth moſt euidently
in the death of Chriſt, doe
tremble and are afraide, lamenting
themſelues vpon him, and heartily
crying for mercy: wheras y• wicked
are altogether careleſſe and contēptuous,
nothing lamenting their iniquities,
or crying to thee heartily for
mercy and pardon. Amongeſt whom
wee are rather to be placed, than amongeſt
thy childrē, for that we are
ſo ſhameleſſe for our ſinnes, & careleſſe
of thy wrath, heaping dailie
ſinne vpon ſinne, ſo that the meaſure
hath ouerflowed and aſcended vp to
heauē, & brought thy heauy plagues
vpon vs, which are but earneſt for
geeater to enſue: therefore to vs pertaineth
ſhame, and nothing elſe is
one but confuſion.
                  
                     
What ſhall we doe? what ſhall wee
ſay? who ſhall giue vs penitēt harts?
who can open our lippes, that our
mouthes might make acceptable cō
                     feſſion
vnto thee, Alas of our ſelues
we cānot think any good, much leſſe
wiſh it, and leaſt of all we it. As for
Angels, or any other creatures, they
haue nothing but that which they
haue receiued, and they are made to
miniſter vnto vs. So that where i
                        •
                     
paſſeth the power of the maiſter, the
miniſter muſt needes want. Alas
then, what ſhall we doe? Thou art
holie, and we vnholie: thou art good
and wee nothing but euill: thou art
pure, & we altogether impure: thou
art light, and we moſt darke darkeneſſe:
howe then can there be any agreement
betwixt vs? O what now
may we do? Diſpayre: No. for thou
art God, and therfore good: thou art
mercifull, and therefore thou forgiueſt

ſinnes: with thee is mercie and
propitiation, and therefore thou art
worſhipped.
                  When Adam had ſinned, thou gaueſt
him mercy before hee deſired it: &
wilt thou deny vs mercy which now
deſire the ſame? Adam excuſed his
fault and accuſed thee: but we accuſe
our ſelues and excuſe thee: and ſhall
we be ſent emptie away? Noe founde
fauour when thy wrath abounded,
and ſhall wee ſeeking grace, be fruſtrate?
Abraham was pulled out of
Idolatrie, when the worlde was
drowned therein: and art thou his
GOD onely? Iſrael in captiuitie in
Egypt was graciouſly viſited, & deliuered:
& deare God, the ſame good
Lord ſhall we alwaies be forgotten?
                  Now often in the wildernes dideſt
thou deferre & ſpare thy plagues at
the requeſtes of Moſes, whē the people
themſelues made no petition to

thee? and ſeeing we not onelie now
make our petitiōs vnto thee through
thy goodneſſe, but alſo haue a mediatour
for vs, farre aboue Moſes, euen

Lorde depart aſhamed? So ſoone as
Dauid ſaid, I haue ſinned, thou diddeſt
forthwith anſwere him, that he

his ſinnes: and gratious God, euen
the ſelfe ſame God, ſhall not wee, not
we which now with Dauid gladlie
confeſſe, that we haue ſinned, ſhal we
(I ſay) not heare by thy good ſpirit,
that our ſinnes bee pardoned? O
graunt that with Manaſſes wee may
finde fauour and mercie.
                  Remember that thou haſt not ſpared
thine owne onely deare Sonne
Ieſus Chriſt, but giuen him to die
for our ſinnes, to riſe for our righteouſneſſe,
to aſcend for our poſſeſſion
taking in heauen, and to appeare before

thee for vs for euer, a high prieſt
after the order of Melchizedech, that
through him we might haue free acceſſe
to come to thy throne, now rather
of grace, than of Iuſtice. Remē

ſeeke and yee ſhall finde, knocke and it
ſhall be opened vnto you. O deare
God, and moſt meeke and mercifull
father, we heartily beſeech thee to be
mercifull vnto vs, for this thy
Chriſts ſake, for his deaths ſake, for
thy promiſe, trueth, & mercies ſake.
Haue mercie vpon vs, pardon and
forgiue vs all our ſinnes, iniquities,
and treſpaſſes, whatſoeuer we haue
committed againſt thee, in thought,
word or deed, euer or at any time hitherto
by any meanes. Deare father,
haue mercy vpon vs. Though we be
poore, yet our Chriſt is rich: though

wee be ſinners: yet hee is righteous:
though wee be fooles, yet he is wiſe:
though we be impure: yet he is pure
and holie: for his ſake therefore bee
merciful vnto vs.
                  Call to minde how thou haſt promiſed
that thou wilt powre out of
thy cleane waters, & waſh vs from
our filthe, and cleanſe vs from our
euils. Forget not that thou haſt promiſed
to take from vs our ſtonye
heartes, and to giue vs ſoft heartes,
newe heartes, & to put in the middeſt
of vs right ſpirits. Remember
thy couenant, namely that thou wilt
be our God, and wee ſhal be thy people:
that thou wilt put out of thy
memory for euer al our vnrighteouſneſſe,
and haſt promiſed to write in
our mindes and hearts thy law and
teſtimonies.
                  Remember that thou doeſt ſtraitly
charge vs to haue none other Gods

but thee, ſaying, that thou art the
Lorde our God. O then declare the
ſame to vs all, we heartilie now beſeech
thee. Forgiue vs our ſinnes,
forget our iniquities, cleanſe vs from
our filthines, waſh vs from our wickedneſſe,
powre out thy holy ſpirite
vpon vs. Take from vs our harde
heartes, our ſtonie heartes, our impenitent
heartes, our diſtruſting and
doubtfull heartes, our carnall, our
ſecure, our idle heartes, our impure,
malitious, arrogant, enuious, wrath
full, impatient, couetous, hypocriticall,
and epicurall hearts: and in place
thereof giue vs new harts, ſoft harts,
faithfull hearts, mercifull hearts, louing,
obedient, chaſt, pure, holy, righteous,
true, ſimple, lowly, and patient
hearts to feare thee, to loue thee, to
truſt in thee for euer.
                  Write thy law in our hearts, graue
it in our mindes, we heartilie beſeech

thee. Giue vs the ſpirite of prayer:
make vs diligent and happie in the

albeit he vanquiſhed Sathan, yet in
as much as he himſelfe was vtterlie

more eaſie. But I to vanquiſh Sathan
being my ſelfe altogether ſinful,
pea contrary to my moſt ſinfull nature

                  A meditation for the exerciſe
of true mortification.
                  HE that will be readie in weightie
matters to denie his owne

will, and to be obedient to the will of
God the ſame had neede to accuſtome
himſelfe to denie his deſtres in matters
of leſſe weight, and to exerciſe
mortification of his owne wil in trifles.
For if that our affections by this
daily cuſtome bee not (as it were)
halfe ſlayne, ſurely, ſurelie, when the
plunge ſhall come, wee ſhall finde the
more to do. If we cannot watch with
Chriſt one houre, (as he ſaieth to Peter)
we vndoubtedlie can much leſſe
goe to death with him. Wherefore,
that in great tentations we may be
readie to ſaie with Chriſt: Not my
will, but thy will be done (for as much
as this commonlie commeth not to
paſſe, but where the rootes of our
luſtes, by thy grace deare father, are
almoſt rotten and rooted out by a daily
deniall of that they deſire) I humbly
beſeech thee for Chriſts ſake to
helpe me herein.
                  
                     
Firſt pardon mee my cheriſhing,
and (as it were) watering of mine
affections, obeying them in their deuiſes
and ſuperfluous deſires: where
through, in that they haue takē deepe
roote, and are too liuely in mee. I ſecondly
doe beſeech thee to pull them
vp by the rootes out of my heart, and
ſo hēceforth to order mee, that I may
continually accuſtome my ſelfe to
weaken the principall roote, that by
the rootes and braunches they may
looſe all their power, Graunt mee (I
beſeech thee) that thy grace may dailie
mortifie my cōcupiſcence of pleaſure
in things, that is, of wealth, riches,
glorie, libertie, fauour of men,
meates, drinks, apparell, eaſe, yea, &
life it ſelfe, that the horrour and impatience
of more greeuous thinges
may be weakened, and I made more
patient in aduerſitie.
                  Whereunto I further l
                        •
                     ſtre and

pray thy goodneſſe, deare father, that
thou wilt ad this: namely that I
pray for euer become obedient and
ready to do thy good wil in althings,
heartily and willingly to ſerue thee,
and doe whatſoeuer may pleaſe thee.
For doubtleſſe although wee accuſtome
our ſelues in ye pleaſant things
of this life, to a mortification and deniall
of ourſelues, yet we ſhall finde
inough to doe, when more bitter and
weightie croſſes come. For if thy
Sonne our Sauiour (euer wont to
obey thy good will) praied ſo heartily
and often Not my will, but thy will be
done, (whereby hee declareth himſelfe
to be verie man) how can it bee,
but wee, whoſe nature is corrupt, not
only in natiuity, but in the reſt of our
whole life alſo, ſhall finde both our
handes full in greate and greeuous
temptations, wholie to reſigne our
ſelues vnto thee?
                  
                     
Graunt therefore deare father, for
thy Chriſtes ſake to me a moſt miſerable
wretch, thy grace and ſpirit to
be effectual in mee, that daily I may
accuſtome my ſelfe, to denie my will
in more eaſie and pleaſant things of
this life, that when neede ſhall bee, I
may come vnto thee with a reſigned
wil, alwaies ſtedfaſtlie expecting thy
mercie, and in the meane ſeaſon continually
obeying thee with readineſſe I
willingneſſe, dooing whatſoeuer may
moſt pleaſe thee, through Chriſt our
Lord, who liueth with thee, &c.
               
               
                  A meditation of the cōming of Chriſt

both of the faithfull
and vnfaithfull.
                  OH Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne
of the euerlluing GOD, by
whom al things were made, are ruled

and gouerned: as of thy loue for our
redemption thou diddeſt not diſdain
to bee our mediator, and to take vpon
thee our nature in the wombe of a
virgin purely and without ſinne, by
the operation of thy holy ſpirit, that
both thou mighteſt in thine owne
perſon wonderfully beautifie and exalt
our nature, and worke the ſame
in vs alſo, firſt aboliſhing the guiltines
of ſinne by remiſſion, then ſinne
it ſelfe by death, and laſt of all, death
by raiſing vp againe theſe our bodies
that they may bee like to thine owne
glorious and immortall bodie, according
to the power wherewith thou
art able to ſubiect all thinges vnto
thee: as (I ſay) of thy loue for our redemption
thou becameſt man, and
that moſt poore and afflicted vpon
earth, by the ſpace of three & thirtie
yeeres at the leaſt, in moſt humilitie,
and paiedſt the price of our ranſome

by thy moſt bitter death and paſſion:
(for the which I moſt heartily giue
thankes vnto thee) ſo of the ſame thy
loue towardes vs, in thy good time
thou wilt come againe in the clouds
of heauen, with power (I greate glory,
with flaming fire, with thouſands
of ſaintes, with Angels of thy power,
with a mighty crie, ſhout of an
Archangel,Math. 24 and blaſt of a trumpe, ſodenly
as a lightening which ſhineth
from the Eaſt, &c. when men thinke
leaſt, euen as a theefe in the night,
when men be aſleepe, thou wilt ſo
come,Math. 15 I ſay, thus ſodainely in the
twinckling of an eie, all men that euer
haue beene, be, or ſhall bee, with
women and children, appearing before
thy tribunall ſeate, to render an
account of all thinges, which they
haue thought, ſpoke, and doone againſt
thy lawe openly and before all
Angels, Saintes, and diuels, and ſo

to receiue the iuſt reward of thy vengeance,

obeyed thy Goſpell, and ſo departe
from thee, to the Diuel and his Angels,
and all the wicked which euer
haue beene, be, or ſhalbe, into helfire,
which is vnquenchable, and of pains
intollerable, eaſeles, endles, hopeles,
euen from the face of thy glorious &
mightie power.
                  But if they haue repented and beleeued
thy Goſpell: if they be founde
watching with their lampe, and oyle
in their handes: if they bee founde
readie apparelled with the wedding
garment of innocencie: if they haue
not hardned their harts, and hourded
vp their treaſure of thy vengeance in
the day of wrath to bee reuealed: but
haue vſed the time of grace, the acceptable
time, the time of ſaluation,
that is, the time of this life, in the
which thou ſtretcheſt out thy hande,

and ſpreadeſt thine armes, calling and
crying vnto vs to come vnto thee,
which art meeke in heart and lawlie,
for thou wilt eaſe all that labour and
are heauie loaden: if they haue viſited
the

                     ke & priſoners, comforted the
comfortleſſe, ſedde the hungrie, clothed
the naked, lodged the harbourleſſe:
if they haue not loaden their
hearts with gluttony and ſurferting
and careleſneſſe of this life: if they
haue not digged and hid their talent
in the grounde, doing no good therewith,
but haue been faithfull to occupie
thy giftes to thy glorie, & haue
waſhed their garments in thy bloode
by heartie repentance: then ſhal thy
Angels gather them together, not as
the wicked which ſhall bee collected
as faggots, & caſt into the fire, but as
the good wheat that is gathered into
the barne: then ſhall they bee caught
vpto meete thee in the cloudes: then

ſhall their corruptible bodie put on
incorruption: then ſhall they bee endued
with immortalitie, and glorie,
then ſhall they be with thee, and goe
whither thou goeſt: then ſhall they
heare: Come ye bleſſed of my father,

from the beginning, &c. Thē ſhal they
be ſet on ſeats of maieſty, iudging the
whole world: then ſhall they raigne
with thee for euer: then ſhal God bee

Ieruſalem, and the glorious reſtfull
lande of Canaan, where it is alwaies
daie & neuer night, where is
no manner of weeping, teares, infirmitie,
hunger, colde, ſickneſſe, enuie,
malice, nor ſinne: but alwaies ioye
without ſorrow, mirth without meaſure,
pleaſure without paine, heauenly
harmony, moſt pleaſant melodie,
ſaying and ſinging: Holie, holie,

holy, Lord God of hoſtes, &c.
                  
                  Finallie the eie hath not ſeene, the
eare hath not hard, neither hath it entred
into the heart of man, that they
ſhall not inherite and moſt ſurely enioy,
although here they be tormented,
priſoned, ſolicited of Sathan, tempted
of the fleſhe, and intangled with
the world, where through they are in
forced to cry:Apo. 22 
                     Thy kingdome come:
Come Lord Ieſu, &c.

for all them that feare thee

                  A meditation of the life euerlaſting
the place where it is, & the incomparable
ioyes thereof.
                  THat there is an euerlaſting life,
none will denie, but ſuch as will
denie God. For if hee be true and
iuſt, (which he muſt needes be, or els
he is not God) then can there not be
but an eternall life. That he hath
both ſpoken it, and promiſed it, in
Math. 25. 1. Cor. 15. Heb 4. 11. 13. 1,
Pet. 1. it plainelie appeareth, & elſewhere
in verie manie places. So y•
to denie an euerlaſting life is to denie
God, to denie Chriſt and all that
euer he did: alſo to denie al pietie
and religion, to condemne of fooliſhneſſe
all good men▪ Martyrs, confeſſors,
Euangeliſts, Prophets, Patriarches.

Finally the denial of eternall
life is nothing elſe but a deniall
of the immortality of the ſoule, and
ſo a plaine making of man nothing
better then beaſtes. If it bee ſo, let vs
then eate and drinke, for to morrow
we ſhall die.1. Co. 15 Lord preſerue vs from
this Saduceall and Epicuriall impietie,
and grant vs for thy mercies
ſake deare God, that we may be aſſuredly
perſwaded, that there is indeed
an eternall life and bliſſe with thee,
for them that put their truſt in thee:
amongſt whome account mee for thy
mercies ſake.
                  Againe this eternall life,VVhere this et

                        nall life is. and the
place appoynted for them that be thy
ſeruauntes, all men doe graunt to bee
with thee. Albeit they do not thinke
that becauſe thou art euery where.
therfore eternal life is euery where,
For they by thy worde doe knowe,
that in as much as no man can ſee

thee and liue, which eternall life and
thy bleſſed preſence is moſt pleaſant
and had in fruition,Iohn. 4. after in another
worlde, whereunto by corporal death
they do departe and are tranſlated to
a place aboue them,1. Tim. 6 wher thou dwelleſt
in a light whereunto no man can
approch. Abrahams boſom (they read)
was aboue, as the place of the wicked
was belowe and beneath. Helias
was caught vp into heauen, and thy
deare Sonne our Sauiour prayed
that where he is, thoſe alſo might bee
which thou haddeſt giuen him,Iohn. 17 and
might ſee his glory. Nowe hee (deare
father we learne by thy ſpirite) was
aſcended & taken vp in his very body
into heauen,Act. 7. whither Stephen looked
vp & ſaw thy Chriſt ſtanding on thy
right hande, to whome he prayed. O
Lord Ieſu, receiue my ſpirite. Graunt
I beſeeeh thee, gratious God and father,
that I may haue a cleane heart

more and more to ſee thee, and ſo in
ſpirite to ſee and looke often vpon
this place: whither bring mee at the
length in bodie alſo I humblie praie
thee.
                  Nowe what a thinge this euerlaſting
life is, no man is able to conceiue,
much leſſe able to vtter: For
the peace of God which is eternall life,
paſſeth all vnderſtanding.
                     1. Cor. 5 
                     The eie hath
not ſeene, the eare hath not heard, neither
can mans hearte conceiue thoſe
thinges which thou (deare God) haſt
prepared for them that loue thee. What
ſo euer therefore can bee ſpoken or
imagined of thy kingdome, of the
cleereneſſe, ioye, and felicitie of the
ſame, is nothing in compariſon, as
wee may ſee by the Prophets: which
(becauſe they coulde not otherwiſe)
vnder corporall thinges haue ſhadowed
the ſame,VVhat knowledge maie. So that the confidence
of eternall life, what a thing it

is, can in no wiſe bee tolde. Howebeit,
ſomewhat wee may be brought
to ſome ſight of it by earthly things
to thinke on this ſorte.be had in this life of the life euerla
                           ••
                        ing. If GOD
haue giuen here ſo many things in a
ſtrange place, how many are ye great
good things yt be at home: If in priſon
are ſo many mercies, how manie
are they in the pallace? If ye wicked
haue ſo many benefites, what is the
ſtore prepared for thy ſeruaunts, Oh
Lord? If thy children find ſuch comforts
in the day of tears & mourning
what ſhall they find in the day of the
mariage? If with beaſtes men being,
haue yt vſe of innumerable bleſſings,
Oh how many are the bleſſings
which they ſhall enioye with
thy Angels, and with thy ſelfe) O
deare God) when they ſhall ſee thee
& haue the fruition of thee: in whom
is fulnes without lothing of al good
& faire thinges, ſo that nothing can

be more deſired, & that for euermore?
                  This thy children doe not ſee as
they now beleeue it: I ſay that euen
in their bodies they ſhall ſee it for euer:
as Iob ſaide, They beleeue that
they ſhall ſee thee, & their owne eies
be holde thee when theſe our corporall
eies, our bodies being rayſed,
ſhal do their duties. Such a knowledge
of thee they beleeue to haue,Iob. 15. as
ſhall not be onely intellectuall and
by faith, as now it is, but euen a full
ſight and fruition, yea, a coniunction
and felowſhip with thee.1. Co. 13 Now they
ſee but as in a glaſſe, euen in a darke
ſpeaking: but then they ſhall ſee thee
face to face.Heb. 11. For faith, though it bee
the ſubſtaunee of things hoped for, &
a certayne darke ſight of thee: yet it
may not be compared to the rewarde
of faith and glorious ſight wh

and hope ſhall ceaſe.
                  
                     
Nowe, thy children knowe that
they be thy ſonnes, though it yet appeare
not what they ſhall bee. Wee
know (ſay they) that when our chriſt
God and man ſhal appeare, then ſhal
we bee like vnto him, for we ſhall ſee
him euen as he is. Oh great prerogatiue
to ſee Chriſt, as he is: which
is not to be conſidered, ſo much for ye
manhead, as for the Godhead it ſelfe
as Paule doth alſo write,1. Co. 15 
                     that when
all thinges are ſubiect vnto the Sonne,
then ſhal he be ſubiect vnto thee deare
Father alſo, that God may be all in all.
And therfore Chriſt our ſauior praied
for vs, that we might knowe thee
the onelie true God: Not that our
Chriſt thy Sonne is not with thee:
the true, coequall, and ſubſtantiall
God, but that we might knowe how
that after the Iudgemente ſuch a
myſterie of his mediatorſhip ſhall
not bee in heauen, as is now in earth.
                  
                     
Then thou bleſſed Trinitie, God
the Father, God the Sonne, and
God the holie Ghoſt ſhalt be al in al:
thou ſhalt bee the end of our deſires:
thou ſhalt bee looked vpon without
ende: thou ſhalt be loued without lothing:
thou ſhalt be prayſed without
wearineſſe. Although loath ſomneſſe

We ſhall be ſatiſfied when wee

graunt vs with thy Saints in euerlaſting
life, to praiſe with perpetuall
praiſes thy holy name. Happie then
and happie againe were wee, if that

daie were come that wee might ſing
with the Angels, Elders, and innumerable
thouſands, a newe ſong, and
ſay: Thou Chriſt Ieſu which waſt ſlain
art worthy to receiue power, & riches,
and wiſedom, & ſtrength, and honour,
and glorie, and bleſſing.
                  
                  In this bleſſed life all kinde of
maladies, griefes, ſorrowes, & euils
be farre away, and all ful of al kinde
of mirth, ioy, and pleaſure. Oh that
wee might ſee now a little with ſaint
Iohn, that holy Citie new Ieruſalem,
deſcending from heauen, prepared of
God as a bride trimmed for her huſband.
Oh that we might nowe ſomething
heare the great voye ſpeaking
out of the throne: Behold the tabernacle
of God is with men, and hee will
dwell with them, and they ſhall be his
people, and hee ſhall bee vnto them
their GOD, hee will wipe away all

                  THis body is but a priſon, wherein
the ſoule is kept, and that
verilie not beautifull nor bright, but

moſt loathſome, if a man conſider the
excrementes of it by the eyes, noſe,
mouth, eares, hands, feete, and all the
other partes. So that no Bocardo, no
Little eaſe, no Dungeon, no Biſhops
priſon, no Gatehoſe, no ſinke, no pit,
may be compared in any point to bee
ſo euill a priſon for the ſoule, as the

bodies for and of the ſoule: wherethrough
the children of God haue
bin occaſioned to crie & lament their
long being in it. Oh ſaith Dauid,
How long ſhall I lie in this priſon, Oh
wretch that I am (ſaith Paule) who
ſhall deliuer mee out of this bodie of
ſinne: Which is in heauie burden to
the ſoule, as the wiſe man ſaith. And
the godly cry:Luke 2 
                     Now let thy ſeruant depart
in peace.
                     Pſal. 1 43 Oh that I were diſſolued
& had put off this earthly & fraile
Tabernacle. Take me vnto thee, and
bring my ſoule out of this priſon, that
it may giue thankes vnto thee, O Lord,
for ſo long as wee bee in this bodie,
wee cannot ſee the Lord: yea, it is as
an heauie habitation, and depreſſeth
down ſore the ſpirit from the familiaritie
which it ſelf ſhould haue with
God. This word and life is an exile,
a vale of miſery, a wilderneſſe of it
ſelfe, being voide of all vertues and

neceſſarie for eternall life, full of enemies
ſorrowes, ſighing, ſobbinges
gronings, raiſeries, &c. In daunger
to hunger, colde, heate, thirſt, ſores,
ſickeneſſe, tentations, trouble, death,
and innumerable calamities, beeing
momentanie, ſhort, vnſtable, and nothing
but vaine, and therefore is compared
to a warfare, a womans trauaile,
a ſhadowe, a ſmoake, a vapor, a
worde, a ſtorme, a tempeſt, in the
which Gods people feele great moleſtations,
griefes, and troubles, nowe
of ſathan himſelfe, now of the world,
now of their own fleſh, & that ſo wonderfully,
diuerſly, dangerouſly; & contrarily,
that they are inforced to cry:
O Lord, when ſhal we come and appear
before thee, when ſhal this miſery end?
when ſhal we be deliuered out of this
vale of miſerie, out of this wilderneſſe,
out of theſe continuall afflictions and
moſt perilous ſeas.
                  
                  
                     
But where thou art (Lorde and
deare Father of mercy) there is not
onely no priſon, no dolours, no ſorrowe,
no ſighings, no teares, no ſickneſſe,
no hunger, no heate, no colde,
no paine, no tentations, no diſpleaſure,
no malice, no pride, no vncleanneſſe,
no contention, no torments, no
horrour, no ſinne, no filth, no ſtinch,
no dearth, no death, no weeping, no
teares, no miſery, no miſchiefe: there
is (I ſay) not only no ſuch thing, or
anie euill, noyſome, or diſpleaſant
thing, but all libertie, all light, all
pleaſantneſſe, all ioye, reioycing
mirth, pleaſure, health, welth, riches

of GOD.
                  THere is nothing that maketh
more to true godlineſſe of life,
than the perſwaſion of thy preſence
(deare father) and that nothing is
hid from thee, but all to thee is open
& naked, euen our very thoughts
which one day thou wilt reueale and
open either to our prayſe or puniſhment
in this life: as thou diddeſt
Dauids faultes which he did ſecretly.
2. Keg. 12. or in the life to come
Matth, 25. for nothing is ſo hid that

ſhall not be reuealed? Therfore doth
the Prophet ſaie: Woe to them that
keepe their ſecret thoughts to hide
their counſell from the Lorde, and doe
their workes in darkneſſe, ſaying, who
ſeeth vs?
                  
                  Graunt mee therefore deare God,
mercie for all my ſinnes, eſpecyallie
my hid and cloſe ſinnes. Enter not
into iudgemēt with mee, I humbly
beſeech thee, giue me to beleeue truely
in the Chriſt, that I neuer come

graunt further, that henceforth I
may alwaies thinke my ſelfe continually
conuerſane before thee, ſo
that if I do well, I need not to paſſe
of the publiſhing of it, as hypocrites

                  Graunt mee that I may alwaies
haue in minde that daie wherein the
hid workes of darkneſſe ſhall be illuminated,
and alſo that ſentence of thy
ſonne, that nothing is ſo ſecret which
ſhall not be reuealed. So in trouble

                  A meditation of the prouidence
of God.
                  THis ought to bee vnto vs moſte
certaine, that nothing is done
without thy prouidence,God worketh all in al, maruellouſly iuſtlie & holilie. (O Lord)
that is, that nothing is done, bee it
good or bad, ſweete or ſowre but by
thy knowledge, that is, by thy will,
wiſedome, and ordinaunce, (for all
this knowledge both comprehend
                        ••
                     
                     
in it) as by thy holie worde wee are
taught in many places: that euen ye
life of a ſparrow is not without thy
wil, nor anie libertie or power vpon
a porket haue all the diuels in Hell,Mat. 10.
but by thy appontment and will:Math. 8.
which will we alwaies muſt beleeue
moſt aſſuredly to be al iuſt and good
howſoeuer otherwiſe it ſeeme vnto
vs: for thou art maruellous and not
comprehenſible in thy waies, & holy
in all thy workes.
                  But hereunto it is neceſſarie alſo
for vs to knowe no leſſe certainlie,God worketh by meanes without meanes and againſt meanes.
that though all thinges bee done by
thy prouidence, yet the ſame prouidence
hath many & diuers meanes
to worke by, which meanes beeing
contemned, thy prouidence is contemned,
alſo. As for example, Meat
is a meane to ſerue thy prouidence
for the preſeruation of health & life
heere, ſo that he which contemneth

to eate becauſe thy prouidence is certaine
and infallible, the ſame contemneth
thy prouidence.
                  In deede, if it were ſo that meate
could not be had, then ſhould we not
tie thy prouidence to this meane, but
make it free as thou art free, that is,
that without meate thou canſt helpe
and giue health and life, for it is not
of any neede that thou vſeſt any inſtrument
or meane to ſerue thy prouidence.
Thy power and wiſedome
is infinite, and therefore ſhoulde wee
hang on thy prouidence, euen, when
all is cleane againſt vs. But for our
crudition and infirmities ſake, it hath
pleaſed thee by meanes to worke and
deale with vs heere, to exerciſe vs in
obedience, and becauſe we cannot elſe
(ſo great is our corruption) ſuſtaine
thy naked and bare preſence.
                  Graunt me therefore deere Father
I humbly beſeech thee for Chriſtes

ſake, that as I ſomthing now know
theſe things, ſo I may vſe this knowledge
to my comfort & commodity in
thee: that is, grant that in what ſtate
ſoeuer I be, I may not doubt but the
ſame doth come to mee by thy moſt
iuſt ordinance, yea, by thy mercifull
ordinance: for as thou art iuſt, ſo art
thou mercifull: yea thy mercie is aboue
all thy workes.
                  And by this knowledge graunte
me that I may humble my ſelfe to obey
thee, & looke for thy helpe in time
conuenient, not onely when I haue
meanes by which thou maieſt work
and are ſo accuſtomed to do: but alſo
when I haue no meanes, but am deſtitute
thereof, yea, when al meanes
be directlye and cleane againſt mee:
grant I ſay, that I may yet ſtil hang
vpon thee and thy prouidence, not
doubting of a fatherly ende in thy
good time.
                  
                     
Againe, leaſt I ſhould contemne
thy prouidence, or preſume vpon it,
by vncoupling thoſe thinges which
thou haſt coupled together: preſerue
mee from neglecting thy ordinary &
lawfull meanes in all my needes, if
ſo be I may haue them, & with good
conſciēce vſe them, although I know
thy prouidence bee not tied to them
further than pleaſeth thee: & graunt
that I may with diligence, reuerence
and thankefulnes, vſe them &,
thereto my diligence, wiſedome, and
induſtrie in all thinges lawfull to
ſerue thereby thy prouidence, if it ſo
pleaſe thee: howbeit ſo that I hang
in no parte on the meanes or on my
diligence, wiſedome, and induſtrie,
but onely on thy prouidence: which
more and more perſwade mee to bee
altogether fatherlie and good, how
farre ſoeuer otherwiſe it appeare &
ſeeme, yea, or elſe is felt of me. By

this I being preſerued from negligence
on my behalfe, and deſpaire or
murmuring towardes thee, ſhall become
diligent and patient through
thy meere and alone grace: which
giue and increaſe in me, to the praiſe
of thy holy name for euer, through

Sauiour. Amen. I. B.
                  
               
               
                  A meditation of Gods power, beauty,
goodneſſe, &c.
                  BEcauſe thou lord wouldeſt haue
vs to loue thee, not onelie doeſt
thou wil, entice, allure, and prouoke
vs, but alſo doeſt commaund vs ſo to
doe, promiſing thy ſelfe vnto ſuch as
loue thee, & threatning vs with dam
nation if we do otherwiſe. Whereby
we may ſee both our great corruptiō
and naughtineſſe, and alſo thine exceeding
great mercie towards vs.
                  Firſt concerning our corruption

and naughtineſſe, what a thing is it,
that power, riches, authority, beautie,
goodnes, liberalitie, trueth, iuſtice
(all which thou art good Lorde) can
not mooue vs to loue thee? Whatſoeuer
things wee ſee faire, good, wiſe,
mightie, are but euen ſparkles of that
power, beautie, goodneſſe, wiſedome,
which thou art. For to the ende thou
mighteſt declare thy riches, beautie,
power, wiſedome, goodneſſe, &c. thou
haſt not onely made, but ſtill doeſt
conſerue all creatures to be (as Dauid
ſaith of the heauens) declarers &
ſetters foorth of thy glorie, and as a
booke to teach vs to knowe thee.
                  How faire thou art, the beauty of
the Sunne, Moone, Starres, lights,
flowers, riuers, fieldes, hilles, birdes,
beaſtes, men and all creatures, yea,
the goodlie ſhape and forme of the
whole world doth declare.
                  Howe mightie thou art, wee are

taught by the creation of this world
euen of nought, by gouerning the
ſame, by puniſhing the wicked mightie
Giants therof, by ouer throwing
their deuiſes, by repreſſing the rages
of the ſea within her boundes, by
ſtormes, tempeſtes & fires. Theſe and
ſuch like declare vnto vs thine inuiſible,
almighty, & terrible power, wherby
thou ſnbdueſt al things vnto thee.
                  Howe rich thou art, this worlde,
thy great and infinite treaſurehouſe,
doth well declare. What plentie is
there not onelie of thinges, but alſo
of euery kinde of thing? Yea, howe
doſt thou yearely and daily multiply
theſe kinds? How many ſeeds doſt
thou make of one ſeede? Yea what
great increaſe doſt thou bring it vnto?
Theſe cannot but put vs in remembrance
of the exceeding riches
that thou haſt. For if to thine enemies
which loue the not (as the moſt

part in this world be) if to them thou
giueſt ſo plentifully thy riches heere:
what ſhall we thinke that with thy
ſelfe thou haſt laid vp for thy friends.
                  Howe good thou art, all creatures
generally and particularly do teach.
What creature is there in the world
which thou haſte not made for our
commoditie? I wil not ſay how that
thou mighteſt haue made vs creatures
without ſenſe or reaſon, if thou
haddeſt woulde. But among all
thinges, none doth ſo teach vs thy
great loue towardes vs, as doth the
death of thy moſt dearelie beloued
ſonne, who ſuffered the pains & terrors
thereof,Iohn, 15. yea and of Hell it ſelfe.
for our ſakes. If this thy loue had
been but a ſmall loue, it would
neuer haue laſted ſo long
nor Chriſt ſhould
neuer haue
died.

                  A Meditation concerning the ſober vſage
of the bodie, that it may be ſubiect
and obedient to the ſoule.
                  THis our body which God hath
made to bee the tabernacle and
manſion of our ſoule for this life, if
we conſider it accordingly, we could
not but vſe it otherwiſe than we do:
that is, we would vſe it for the ſouls
ſake being the gueſt thereof, and not
for the bodie it ſelfe, and ſo ſhould it
be ſerued in things to helpe, but not
to hinder the ſoule. A ſeruant it is, &
therefore it ought to obey & ſerue the
ſoule, that the ſoule might ſerue God
not as the body will, neither as the
ſoule it ſelfe will, but as God will,
whoſe wil we ſhould learne to know
and behaue our ſelues therafter. The
which thing to obſerue is harde for
vs nowe: by reaſon of ſinne which
hath gotten a manſion houſe in our

bodie, & dwelleth in vs as doth the
ſoule. To the which (ſinne I meane)
wee are altogether of our ſelues inclined,
becauſe we naturally are ſinners
and borne in ſinne, by reaſon
whereof wee are redie as ſeruantes
to ſinne, and to vſe our bodies accordingly,
making the ſoule to ſit at reward,
and pampering vp the ſeruant
to our ſhame.
                  Oh therefore (good Lorde) that it
would pleaſe thee to open this geare
vnto mee, and to giue mee eies to conſider
effectually th
                        •
                     s my body what
it is, namely a ſeruant lent for thee
ſoule to ſoiourne in, and ſerue the
in this life: yea it is by reaſon of ſin
that hath is dwelling ther, become
nowe hto the ſoule nothing elſe, but a
priſon, and that moſt ſtrait, vile, ſtinking,
filthy, and therefore in danger
of miſeries to many in al ages, times
and places, till death haue turned it

to duſt whereof it came, and whither
it ſhall returne, that the ſoule may returne
to thee from whence it came,
vntill th
                        •
                      day of iudgement come, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
the which thou wilt raiſe vp that bodie,
that then it may be partaker with
the ſoule, and the ſoule with it inſeparably
of weale or woe, according
to that is done in and by the ſame bodie
here now in earth.
                  Oh that I coulde conſider often
and heartily theſe things, then ſhould
I not pamper vp this body to obey
it, but bridle it that it might obey
the ſoule: then ſhould I flie the paine
it putt

of ſinne and prouocation to all euill,
and continually deſire the diſſolution
of it with Paule, and the deliuerance
from it as much as euer did priſoner
his deliuerance out of priſon: for al

                     ely
by it the Diuell hath a doore to
tempt, and ſo to hurt mee: in it I am

kept from thy preſence, & thou from
being ſo conuerſant with me, as elſe
thou wouldeſt be: by it I am reſtrayned
from the ſenſe and feeling of all
the ioyes and comfortes (in maner)
which are to bee taken as ioyes and
comfortes indeede. If it were diſſolued
and I out of it, then coulde
ſathan no more hurt me, then wouldeſt
thou ſpeak with me face to face,
then the conflicting time were at an
end, then ſorrowe would ceaſe, and
ioy would increaſe, and would I enter
into ineſtimable reſt. Oh that I
could conſider this accordingly. I. B.
                  
               
               
                  Another meditation concerning the
ſober vſage of this bodie and
pleaſure in this life.
                  The beginning of all euill in our
kinde of liuing, ſpringeth out of
the deprauation and corruptneſſe
of our iudgement, becauſe our will

alwaies followeth that which reaſō
iudgeth to be followed. Nowe, that
which euery man taketh to be friendly
and agreeing to his nature, the
ſame doth he iudge neceſſarily to be
good for him, and to be deſired. This
is meate, drinke, apparel, riches, fauour,
dignitie, rule, knowledge, and
ſuch like, becauſe they are thought
good & agreeing, either to the bodie
or to the minde, or to both, for they
helpe either to the cōuerſation or to
the pleaſure of man accounted of euerie
one amongſt good things.
                  Howbeit, ſuch is the weakenes of
our wit on the one part, & the blindnes
and too much rage of our luſtes
on the other part, that wee being left
to our ſelues, cannot but in the deſire
of things which we iudge good
and agreeing to our nature, by the
iudgement of our ſenſes and reaſon,

                        •
                     e cannot (I ſay) but ouerpaſſe the

boundes whereby they might be profitable
vnto vs, & ſo wee make them
hurtful vnto vs, which of thēſelues
are ordained for our health.
                  What is more neceſſarie than meat
and drinke, or more agreeing to nature,
but yet how few be there which
do not hurt themſelues by them? In
like maner it goeth with riches, eſtimation,
friends, learning, &c. yea although
wee be in theſe moſt temperate,
yet when there wanteth the ſpirite
our regenerator, we ar ſo drowned
in them, that we vtterly neglect
to lift vp your minds to the good pleſure
of God, to the ende we might
imitate and follow God our maker,
by yeelding our ſelues ouer, dulie to
vſe his giftes to the common & priuate
vtilitie of our neighbors.

it bringeth.

Lord, againſt vs: but when we ſhall
be let out of the priſon of this body,
and ſo taken into thy bleſſed companie,
then ſhall we be in moſt ſafetie
of immortalitie and ſaluation,
then ſhal come vnto vs no ſickeneſſe,
no neede, no paine no kind of euil to
ſoule or bodie, but whatſoeuer good

we can wiſh, that ſhall we haue, and
whatſoeuer wee loath, ſhall be farre
from vs. O deare father, yt wee had
faith to behold theſe thinges accordingly,
O that our hearts were perſwaded
thereof, and our affections
inflamed with the deſire of them.
                  Then ſhould we liue in longing for
that which now wee muſt loath. Oh
helpe vs, and graunt that wee beeing
ignorant of thinges to come and of
the time of our death (which to thee
is certayne) may ſo loue & finiſh our
iourney here, that we may be readie,
and then depart when our departing
may make moſt to thy glorie, & our
comfort through Chriſt.
                  What is this life but a ſmoke, a
vapour, a ſhadowe, a warre farre, a
bubble of water, a worde, graſſe, a
flower? That thou ſhalt die, it is
moſt certaine, but the time no man
can tell when. The longer in this life

thou doeſt remayne, the more thou
ſinneſt: which wil turne to thy more
paine. By cogitation of death our
mindes be often in maner oppreſſed
with darkeneſſe, becauſe we doe but
remember the night of the body, forgetting
the light of the minde & of
the reſurrection.
                  Hereto remēber the good thinges
that after this life ſhall inſue without
wauering in certaintie of faith,
and ſo ſhall the paſſage of death bee
more deſired It is like a ſailing ouer
the ſea to thy home and countrie, it
is like a medicine or purgation to ye
health of ſoule & body: it is the beſt
Phiſition: it is like to a womans
trauell. For as the childe being deliuered
commeth into a more large
place, than the womb where in it did
lie before: ſo thy ſoule being deliuered
out of the bodie, commeth into
a much more large and faire place

euen vnto heauen.
               
               
                  A meditation vpon the paſsion of our
Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.
                  OH Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ye ſonne
of the euerliuing God, by whom
all things were made, and bee ruled
and gouerned: thou the liuely Image
of the ſubſtance of the Father
the eternall wiſedome of God, the
brightneſſe of his glorie, GOG of
God, light of light, coequall, coeternall
and ſubſtantiall with the father:
thou which of the loue thou
hadſt to mankinde, when hee was
fallen from the fellowſhippe of God
into the ſociety of Sathan and al euil,
didſt vouchſafe for our redemption,
to become a mediator betweene
God & man, taking to thy godheade
our nature, as concerning the ſubſtance
of it, and ſo becameſt man alſo
the heire of all, and moſt merciful

Meſſias, which by the power of thy
Godheade and merites of thy manhoode,
haſt made purgation of our
ſinnes, euen by thine own ſelfe, whileſt
thou waſt heere on earth, beeing
nowe ſet on the right hand of thy father
for vs, euen concerning our nature,
in maieſty, glory & power infinite,
I praie and humblie beſeech thy
mercy to graunt mee at this preſent
to reherſe ſome of thy paſſions & ſufferings
for mee the laſt night yt thou
waſt here before thy death, that thy
good ſpirit might therby be effectuall
to worke in me faith, as well of the
pardon of my ſinnes by them, as mortification
of mine affections, comfort
in my croſſes, and patience in afflictions
Amen.
                  In the midſt of thy laſt Supper
with thy deere apoſtles, theſe things
coulde not but bee before thee, namely
that they all woulde leaue thee,

the moſt earneſt woulde forſweare
thee, and one of the twelue ſhoulde
moſt trayterouſly betray thee▪ which
were no ſmal croſſes vnto thee. Iudas
was admoniſhed of thee to beware,
but when he tooke no heede, but wilfully
went out to finiſh his worke,
contemning thy admonition & counſell:
hee coulde not but vexe thy moſt
louing heart.
                  After ſupper there was contention
amongeſt thy Diſciples, who ſhould
bee greateſt after thee, yet dreaming
carnally of thee and thy kinkdome, &
hauing this affection of pride & ambition
buſie amongeſt them notwithſtanding
thy diligence in reprouing
and teaching them.
                  After thy admonition to them of
the croſſe that would come, therby to
make them more vigilant, ſo groſſe
were they, that they thought they
coulde with their two ſwordes put

away all perils, which was no little
greefe vnto thee. After thy comming
to Gethſemane, heauines preſſed thee
and therefore thou wouldeſt thy diſciples
to pray. Thou didſt tell to Peter
and his fellowes, that thy harte
was heauie to death. Thou diddeſt
will them to pray, being carefull for
them alſo leaſt they ſhould fall into
temptation. After this thou wenteſt
a ſtons caſt from them, & diddeſt pray
thy ſelfe, falling flat & goueling vpon
the earth: but (alas) thou felteſt no
comfort▪ & therefore thou cameſt to
thy Diſciples (which of all others
were moſt ſweete & deere vnto thee)
but loe▪ to thy further diſcomfort
they paſſe neyther of thy perils, nor
of the
                        •
                     r owne, and therefore ſleepe
apace.
                  After thou hadſt awaked them,
thou goeſt againe to pray, but thou
foundeſt no comfort at al, and therefore

diddeſt returne againe for ſome
cōfort at thy deareſt friends hands.
But yet againe (alas) they are faſt a
ſleepe. Wherupon thou art inforced
to goe againe to thy heauenly father
for ſome ſparke of comfort in theſe
thy wonderfull croſſes and agonies.
Now, here thou waſt, ſo diſcouraged
& ſo comfortleſſe, that euen ſtreams
of bloude came running from thine
eies and eares, and other partes of
thy bodie. But who is able to expreſſe
the infiniteneſſe of thy croſſe
euen at thy being in the garden? Al
which thou ſufferedſt for my ſake,

for my ſins, as alſo to ſanctifie al my
ſufferings, the more gladly to be ſuſteined
for mee.
                  After thy bloody prayer thou cameſt
& yet againe foundeſt thy diſciples
a ſleepe, & before thou canſt
well awake them, loe, Iudas commeth

with a great bande of men to
apprehende thee as a theefe, and ſo
doth, leading thee away bound to y•
high Biſhops houſe Annas, and ſo
from him to Caiphas. Heere now to
augment this thy miſery, behold thy
diſciples fly from thee: falſe witneſſes
be brought againſt thee: thou art
accuſed and condemned of blaſphemie:
Peter euen in thy ſight forſweareth
thee: thou art vniuſtly ſtricken
for anſwering lawfullie: thou art
blindfold, ſtriken and buffeted al the
whole night in the biſhop Caiphas
houſe of their ſeruants.
                  In the morning betimes thou art
condemned againe of the Prieſts of
blaſpemie, and therefore they bring
thee before the ſeculiar power to Pilate,
by whome thou art openly arraigned
as other theeus & malefactors
were: and when hee ſawe that
thou waſt accuſed of malice, yet hee

did not diſmiſſe thee, but did ſend thee
to Herod, where thou was ſhamefully
derided in comming and going to
him and from him al the way, eſpecially
after Herod had apparelled thee
as a foole.
                  Afore Pilate againe therefore, thou
waſt brought and accuſed falſely: no
man did take thy parte, or ſpeake a
good word for thee.
                  
                     Pylate cauſed thee to bee whipped
and ſcourged, and to be handled moſt
pittifully, to ſee if any pittie might
appeare with yu prelates, but no man
at all pitied thee.
                  
                     Barrabas was preferred before thee,
all the people, heade and taile was
againſt thee, and cryed hang him vp,
Vniuſtly to death was thou iudged
thou was crowned with thornes y•
pierced thy braines: thou waſt made
a mocking ſtock
                        •
                     : thou waſt reueiled,
beaten and moſt miſerably handled.
                  
                     
Thou wenteſt through Ieruſalem
to the place of execution, euen to the
Mount of Caluarie: a great croſſe to
hang thee on, was laid vpō thy back
to beare and drawe as long as thou
was able.
                  Thy body was racked to be nayled
to the tree, thy hands were boared
through, & thy feete alſo, nailes
were put through them to faſtē thee
thereon: thou waſt hanged between
heauen & earth, as one ſpued out of
heauen, & vomited out of the earth.
vnworthie of any place: the high
Prieſt laughed thee to ſcorne, the
Elders blaſphemed thee, and ſaide

people laughed and cried out
vpon thee, thirſt oppreſſed thee, but
Vinegar onely and gall was giuen
thee to drink: heauē ſhined not vpon
thee: the Sunne gaue thee no light:
y• earth was afraid to beare thee: ſathan

God my God, why haſt thou forſaken
mee? Oh wonderful paſſions, which
thou ſufferedſt. In them thou teacheſt
mee: in them thou comforteſt
mee: for by them God is my father:
my ſinnes are forgiuen. By them I
ſhould learne to feare God, to loue
God, and neuer to leaue him for any
temptations, but with thee to crie:
Father into thy handes I commende
my ſpirite.
                  
               
               
                  A prayer to Chriſt crucified.
                  AS thou, O Lorde was crucified
for me: ſo I beſeech thee crucifie
me with thee, that I may riſe again
with thee to euerlaſting life. Thy
fleſh was crucified for mee: crucifie
with thee: (O CHRIST) the
kingdome of the fleſhe, which hath
dominion in mee, that I may put off
the old Adam, and by neweneſſe of

life may bee tranſformed into thee the
ſeconde Adam, ſinne, infidelitie, and
the whole tyrannie of Sathan being
vanquiſhed and ouercome.
                  Bring to paſſe (O Lorde) that by
thy croſſe and payneful ſuffering, thy
yoake may be to me made light, and
thy burthen eaſie, that willingly and
gladly following thee, I may come
whither thou art gone: that is, to thy
father moſt bleſſed and immortall,
from whome nothing ſhall afterward
be able to ſeperate vs.
                  God forbid that I ſhoulde reioyce in
anie thing, but in the croſſe of our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, wherby the world
is crucified vnto mee, and I vnto the
world. Gal. 6.
               
               
                  A Prayer to Chriſt aſcended and
raigning in glorie.
                  OH good Chriſt, our firſt begotten
brother and tender hearted

Ioſeph, Oh naturall Sonne of
that Father, to whome we are made
Children of adoption through thee,
Oh our head raigning on high in
glorie, forget not vs thy poore members
heere on earth, whereunto abaſing
thy ſelfe thou cameſt downe and
ſufferedſt for vs moſt cruell death.
Out of this thy throne of Maieſty &
glore, thou putteſt vs in aſſured hope
and confidence that wee alſo ſhall attayne
to that bleſſed place, whither
thou art gone before to take poſſeſſion
for vs. Oh our ſtrōg tower of defence
and ſuccour, what can hurt vs nowe
truſting in thee? Moſt vnhappie are
they which are ignorant of thee.
Moſt happy are they, which alwaies
behold thee. Bleſſed are they which
haue knowne thee heere in the dayes
of their mortalitie: But more bleſſed
are they which ſee thee in the
heauens, and ſhall ſee thee reigning

with thy father in ioyes incomparable.
Oh Lorde the onelie ioye and
comfort of our ſouls, ſhew vs thy louing
countenance, embrace vs with
the armes of thy mercie: receiue vs
O good Ioſeph, thy younger brethrē
with the kiſſe of comfort powre into
our hearts thy holy ſpirite: pluck vs
vp from the earth & earthly things:
open our eies and lift them vp vnto
thee: open thy mouth & call vs vnto
thee: open our eares that wee may
heare thee ſo that whatſoeuer we do
ſpeake or thinke, it may bee directed
vnto thee alone our redeemer, mediator
and aduocate.
                  If ye be riſen againe with Chriſt, ſeeke
the thinges which are aboue, where
Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God:
ſet your affection on thinges that are
aboue, and not on thinges which are
on earth. Col. 3.
               
               
                  
                  Another.
                  THou Lord diddeſt put away Marie
Magdalen from the kiſſing of
thy feete, becauſe thy fleſh was not
yet exalted, and ſhe knew not yet the
dignitie of thy clarified bodie, and
beautified with the glorie of immortalitie,
but was addicted only to thy
bodily preſence.
                  She yet ſought the liuing among
the dead, neither was it knowne to
her that thou was equall with thy
father. Wherfore thou wouldeſt not
ſuffer her ſo much as to kiſſe thy
feet:Luke. 14. becauſe it was a thing vnworthy
for thy maieſty. Oh thou mighty
Lion of the tribe of Iuda: thou conquerour
of hel and death, euerliuing
and immortall, thou art nowe riſen
from death for vs: thou art now aſcended
to thy father and our father,
and ſitteſt at his right hand in glorie:
ſuffer vs to come neere vnto thee

that wee may kiſſe thee: yea, Lorde,
thou louer of our ſoules come thou
rather vnto vs,Gan. 1. and kiſſe vs with the
kiſſe of thy mouth, that wee may bee
glad and reioyce in thee, drawe vs
that wee may runne after the ſauour
of thy ſweete oyntments: that wee
may behold thee in righteouſneſſe,
and when thy glorie ſhall appeare
wee may bee ſatiſfied,Pſal. 17. for in thy preſence
there is fulneſſe of ioy, and in
thy right hande there are pleaſures

what ſhall I ſay that feele all
thinges to bee (in manner) with mee
as in the wicked? blind is my mind,
crooked is my will, and peruerſe concupiſcence
is in mee, as aſpring or
ſtinking puddle. O howe fainte is
faith in mee? How little is my loue

is ſelfe loue? Howe harde is my
heart? By the reaſon whereof I am

mooued to doubt of thy goodneſſe towardes
mee, whether thou art my
mercifull father, and whether I bee
thy childe or

                        〈◊〉
                      why thou art my father is thy
mercie goodneſſe, grace and trueth in

for euer. In reſpect whereof
thou haſte borne me this good will,
to bring me into thy Church by baptiſme,
and to accept me into the number

holy, faithfull, obedient and innocent
and to cal me diuers times vp the miniſterie
of thy worde into thy kingdome:
beſides thy innumerable other
benefites, alwayes hitherto powred
vpon mee, All which thou haſt done
of this thy good will which thou of
thine owne mercie bareſt to mee in

in tentation.
                  DEare father, to whom it is more
eaſie to doe all thinges, then for
mee to thinke anie one goodthing:
Loe, doe thou but ſpeake a worde,

for thy trueth ſake, and for thy deare

                  Thou art faithfull (O Father)
who haſt promiſed that I ſhall not
bee tempted further, than thou wilt
make me able to beare. Giue nowe
therefore thy grace and ſtrength vnto

deare Father, the poſtes thereof are

                        My ſonne, if thou wilt come into
theſe rule of the Lorde, ſtande faſt in
righteouſnes & feare, and prepare thy
ſoule to tentation.
                     Eccleſ. 2.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Remedies againſt ſinfull motions
and tentations.
                  Firſt remember that ſinne is ſo hainous
a thing, that God by his iuſtice
might worthilie damne thee for the
ſame, and is therefore to bee abhorred
as a ſweete poyſon, a flattering death &
deſtruction of the ſoule, which woulde
cut thee off from God thy Sauiour, and
make thee a bondſlaue to Sathan thy
deadlie enemie.
                  Auoide therefore euen at the firſt
the occaſions thereof, & betimes quaſh
out the braines of the childrē of Babylon
againſt the hard ſtones, whiles yet
they bee young and weake, leaſt when
they be growne elder & ſtronger, they
daſh thee to peeces.
                  And for remedie againſt the ſame,
flee vnto God who commandeth thee
to call vpon him in thy troubles, and
promiſeth to deliuer thee, and wil not

ſuffer thee to be further tempted than
hee will make away out, whereby thou
ſhalt eſcape: and doubt not, but he that
cauſeth thee to hate the ſinne which
thy nature is to loue, will deliuer thee
alſo from the daunger thereof, and
make thee to triumphouer Sathan, to
his confuſion, to Gods glorie, and thy
great comfort: which are cauſes that
our tender louing father ſendeth tentations
vnto vs: & he that is not tempted,
what is he?
                  Nowe after thou haſt obtained the
victory, remember two thinges: firſt
to giue moſt heartie thankes to God
for his grace and aſſiſtance, whereby
thou haſt ouercome, and bee not vnthankefull
in anie wiſe: and then that
hee who continually goeth about like
a roring Lion, ſeeking whome he maie
deuoure, wil not be long or farre away
from thee, but will attempt againe the
ſame or as euill waies to ouercome

thee. Watch therefore and praye.
               
               
                  A prayer for the auoiding of Gods
heauie wrath and vengeance
for our ſins.
                  OH Lord God ſtrong and mighty
great and feareful which dwelleſt

we thy miſerable children

thee to be mercifull vnto vs, to
pardon our offences, and to forgiue
vs all our ſinnes. O Lord, enter not
into iudgement with thy ſeruantes,
for if thou doe, there ſhall no fleſh bee
ſaued in thy ſight.
                  Wee confeſſe and acknowledge, O
Lorde, that it is our ſinnes, which
hath moued thee to wrath, and to

diſpleaſure towardes vs in theſe our

betokening thy hote burning iud gnation
and wrathful diſpleaſure for
ſinne, which aboundeth at this day:
then with ſuch horrible and monſtrous
shatmpes againſt nature, as wer
neuer ſeen heere in our daies, nor in
any time before vs, which doe betoken
to vs none other thing, but thy
plagues to come vpon vs for our degenerate

that neither preaching by word moſt
comfortable, nor preaching by fire
moſt terrible, nor preaching by monſters
moſt ſtraunge and ouglie, neither
yet by plagues and peſtilence
moſt horrible, will ſtirre by our ſtonie
heartes, and awake from our
ſinnes.
                  Wee feare (O Lorde) that the

                  O Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which arl
the onely health of all men liuing,
and the euerlaſting life of them
that die in thee: I wretched ſinner
doe ſubmit my ſelfe wholy vnto thy

moſt bleſſed will, and being ſure that
the thing cannot periſh which is committed
vnto thy mercie, willinglie
now I leaue this fraile and ſinneful
fleſh, in ſure hope that thou wilt in
better wiſe reſtore it to meE againe
at the loſt day in the reſurrection of
the iuſt. I beſeech thee moſt mercifull
Lord ieſus Chriſt, that thou
wilt by thy grace make ſtrong my
ſoule againſt all tentations, and defende
mee with the buckler of thy
mercie againſt all the aſſaultes of the
diuell.
                  I ſee and acknowledge that there
is in my ſelfe no hope of ſaluation,
but all my confidence, hope, and truſt
is in thy rich mercie and goodneſſe.
I haue no merites or good workes
which I may alledge before thee: of

a great heape: but yet through thy
mercie I truſt to be in the number of

them to whom thou wilt not impute
their ſinnes, but wilt accept and take
mee for righteous and iuſt, and to
bee an inheritour of Euerlaſting
life.
                  Thou mercifull Lorde waſt borne

hunger and thirſt for my ſake: thou
diddeſt teach, pray, and faſt for my

thou wroughteſt for my ſake: thou
ſufferedſt moſt greeuous painEs and
torments for my ſake: Finally, thou
gaueſt thy moſt precious bodie and
bloud to be ſhed on the croſſe for my
ſake. Now moſt merciful Sauiour,
let all thoſe thinges profite mee, that
thou freely haſt done for mee, which
haſt giuen thy ſelfe alſo for mee. Let
thy blond clenſe and waſh away the
ſpottes and fowlneſſe of my ſinnes.
Let thy righteouſnes hide and couer
my righteouſneſſe. Let the merites

of thy paſſion and bloodſhedding be
the ſatiſfaction for my ſinnes. Giue
mee Lord thy grace, that the faith of
my ſaluation in thy blood wauer not

that the hope of thy mercy and
life euerlaſting neuer decay in mee:
that loue waxe not colde in mee: Finally,

may crie & ſay: Lorde into thy handes
I commend my ſoule: Lord Ieſu receiue

childe.
                  
                     
THou art wonderfull (O Lorde)
in all thy workes▪ and whatſoeuer
thy good pleaſure is, that doeſt
thou eaſily bring to paſſe, neither is
ther any thing vnpoſſible with thee
that thou wilt haue doon. And albeit
this thy almightie power ſheweth it
ſelfe abundantly in all thy workes,
yet in conceiuing, forming and bringing
forth of man, it ſhineth moſt euidently.
                  At the beginning (O Father)
when thou madeſt man and woman,
thou commaundeſt them to increaſe,
multiplie, and repleniſh the earth.
If through the ſubtile inticementes
of Sathan they had not tranſgreſſed
thy commaundement by eating the
forbidden fruite, the woman whome
thou haddeſt appointed to be the inſtrument
& veſſell to conceiue, nouriſh
and bring foorth man through thy
woonderful workmanſhip, had with

out any labour, paine or trauaile
brought forth her fruite.
                  But that which thy goodnes made
eaſie, ſin and diſobedience hath made
harde, painfull, daungerous and
without thy ſpeciall helpe and ſuccour,
impoſible to bee brought to
paſſe,: ſo that nowe all women bring
forth their childrē in great ſorrows,
paines, and troubles. Notwithſtanding,
that which through their own
imperfection and feeblenes, they are
not able of themſelues to paſſe, thou
through thine vnſpeakable power
makeſt eaſie in them, and bringeſt
vnto a ioyfull ende.
                  Wee therefore being fully perſwaded
of thy fauour and goodneſſe, of
thy preſent helpe, and of thy ſweete
comfort in all miſeries and neceſſities,
knowing alſo by the teſtimonies
of thy holy word how great and
intollerable the paines of women

are that trauell of child, if through
thy tender mercy they be not mittigated
and eaſed: moſt humbly praye
thee for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake thy ſon
our Lorde, to helpe and aſſiſt this thy
ſeruant nowe in trauell and labour,
that by thy almightie power ſhee may
ſafely bring foorth that which by thy
goodneſſe ſhee hath conceaued, and
that thy louing kindneſſe may make
that eaſie and tollerable vnto her,
which ſinne hath made hard and
painefull.
                  Eaſe (O Lorde) the paines which
thou moſt righteouſly haſt put vpon
her and all women, for the ſinne and
diſo bedience of our Graundmother
Eue, is whome al we haue ſinned. Be
preſent with her in her trouble, according
to thy mercifull promiſe:
Giue her ſtrength, and make perfect
that which thou haſt ſo gratiouſLie
begun. Let thy power be ſhewed no

leſſe in the ſafe bringing forth, than
in the wonderfull forming & faſhioning
of that ſhee beareth. Make her
a glad and ioyfull mother, that ſhee
through thy goodnes being ſafely deliuered
and reſtored to health again,
may liue and praiſe thy bleſſed name
for euer.

                  1. Tim. 2.
               
               
                  AL mightie and moſt
mercifull Father, I
thy poore creature &
work of thy hands,
acknowledge & confes
vnto thee my manifolde
ſinnes and 
                     •
                  ffences, which I
frō my youth vp vnto this day, haue
committed againſt thee in thoughte,
word & deede, beſeeching thee for Ieſus
Chriſt thy deere ſonnes ſake, to

haue mercie vpon mee, and to pardon
the ſame according to thy greate mercie,
which haſt promiſed, that At what
time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent him
of his ſinne, from the bottome of his
heart, thou wilt put his wickedneſſe out
of thy remembrance.
               
               O Lord, I confeſſe that I was
borne in ſinne, and conceiued in wickedneſſe,
and am by nature a childe
of wrath: for in my fleſh dwelleth
no good thing, and of my ſelfe
I am not able to thinke a good
thought, much leſſe to doe that thou
in thy lawe requireſt of mee, ſaying:
Curſed is he that continueth not in
all thinges that are written in the lawe
to doe them. Againe, thy lawe is
ſpirituall, but I am carnall, ſould vnder
ſinne. Therefore, O LORD,
I come vnto thee for grace (which
haſt ſaid, Aske & ye ſhal haue ſeeke &
ye ſhall find: knock & it ſhal be opened

vnto you) to preuent & draw my will
vnto all goodneſſe: for none can come
vnto thee except he be drawn: & except
we be borne from aboue, we cannot
ſee the kingdom of God.
               Therefore (O Lord) renew in mee
a right ſpirit, that I may receiue
ſtrength and ablenes, to doe thy righteous
will.
               Grant that I may euer deſire and
will that which is moſt pleaſing and
acceptable to doe thy will.
               Thy will be my will, and my will
be alwayes to follow thy will:
               Let there be euer in mee one will &
one deſire with thee, and let me neuer
deſire to will or not to will, but as
thou wilt.
               Graunt mee that aboue all things
I may reſt in thee, and fully quiet &
pacifie my heart in thee: for thou Lord
art the true peace of the heart, and the
perfect reſt of the ſoule.
               
                  
Thou knoweſt Lord, what is moſt
profitable & expedient for me: where.
fore doe with mee in al things as it
ſhall ſeeme beſt vnto thee. For it may
not be but well that thou doſt which
doeſt moſt iuſtly and bleſſedly diſpoſe
al things after thy moſt godly wiſedome.
Therefore whether it be by
proſperitie or aduerſitie, loſſe or gain,
ſickneſſe or health, life or death, thy
will be done.
               Caſt out of my heart, al vnprofitable
cares of worldly thinges, and
ſuffer me not to be lead with the vnſtable
deſires of earthly vanities: but
giue me grace that all worldlye and
carnal affections may bee mortified &
die in mee.
               Graunt vnto mee the ſtrength of
thy holie ſpirite, to ſubdue this body
of ſinne with the whole luſtes thereof,
that it may be obedient both in
wil, minde and members: to do thy

holy wil:
               Aſſiſt me with thy grace (O Lord)
that I may be ſtrenthened in the inwarde
man,Epheſ. 6. and bee armed with thy
holy armor, which is the breaſtplate
of righteouſneſſe, the ſhielde of
faith, the hope of ſaluation for an
helmet, and the ſworde of the ſpirit,
which is thy holy word, that I may
ſtand perfect in all that is thy will,
& be found worthy through Chriſt,
to receiue the crowne of life, which
thou haſt promiſed to all them that
loue thee.
               Giue me grace that I may eſteeme
all thinges in this world as they be,

vnder the Sunne may long abide,
but all is vanitie and affliction of
ſpirite.
               Oh Lorde God which art ſweeteneſſe

vnſpeakeable turne into bitterneſſe
vnto me all tranſitorie & earthly
delights, which may drawe mee
from the loue of eternall things: and
for al worldly comforts, giue me the
ſweete comfort of thy holy ſpirit: for
thou Lord art my ioy, my hope, my
crowne, and my glorie.
               Bleſſed are they that for the loue
of thee, ſet not by the pleaſurs of this
worlde, but crucifie the fleſh and the
iuſtes thereof, ſo that in a cleane &
pure conſcince they may offer their
praiers vnto thee, and be accepted to
haue companie with thee, together
with the Angels & heauenly ſpirits.
               O euerlaſting light, ſend down the
beames of thy brightneſſe and lighten
the inward partes of my heart.
               Open my heart, that I may behold
thy lawes, and teach me to walke in
thy commaundements.
               Beholde my weaknes (O Lord)

be clarified and made glorious in thy
kingdome.
               Oh holie father, thou haſt ordeyned
it ſo to be, and it is done as thou
haſt appoynted.
               Wherefore (O Lorde) giue mee
the grace to reſt in thee aboue all
things, and to quiet my heart in thee
aboue all creatures, aboue all glorie
and honour, aboue all dignitie and
power, aboue all health and beauty,
aboue all riches and treaſure, aboue
al ioy and pleaſure, aboue all fame &
praiſe, aboue al mirth and conſolation
that mans hart may take or feele

moſt good, moſt wiſe, moſt righteous,
moſt holie, moſt iuſt, moſt
bleſſed, moſt high, moſt mightie,
moſt comfortable, moſt beautifull
moſt louing, moſt glorious, in whom

And therefore, whatſoeuer I haue
beſides thee, it is nothing vnto me: or
my heart may not reſt, nor fully bee
pacified, but onely in thee.
               Oh Lord Ieſu, who ſhall giue mee
wings of perfect loue, that I may fly
vp from theſe worldly miſeries, and
reſt with thee?
               Oh Chriſt the king of euerlaſting
glorie, my ſoule crieth vnto thee with
continual gronings, & ſaith: How long
tarrieth my Lord God to come to me?
               
               Oh, when ſhall the ende come of
all theſe miſeries?
               When ſhall I cleane be deliuered
from the bondage of ſinne?
               When ſhall I Lord, haue my minde
onely fixed on thee, and be merrie in
thee with perfect ioy and gladnes?
               When ſhal that bleſſed houre come
that thou ſhalt viſit mee, and make
mee glad with thy bleſſed preſence,
when thou ſhalt bee to mee all in all?
               
                  
When ſhall I come vp to thee, and
feele and enioy thoſe ſweete conſolations
which with thy bleſſed Saints
are alwaies preſent?
               When ſhall I haue peace without
trouble, peace without & peace within
and on euery ſide ſtedfaſt & ſure?
               O Lord Ieſu, when ſhal I ſtand
and behold thee, and haue full ſight &
contemplation of thy glorie?
               When ſhall I bee with thee in thy
kingdom, that thou haſt ordained for
thine elect before the beginning?
               Oh bleſſed manſion of that heauenly
citie: Oh moſt cleare daie of
eternitie, whom the night may neuer
darken.
               This is the daye alwaies cleare &

the chaſtiſemēt of our peace
is laid vpon him.

which drew thee out of thy Fathers
boſome, into the wombe of the holie

mans nature, wherin it pleaſeth thee
to ſaue mee, and to deliuer mee from
eternall death: that thou wouldeſt
drawe mece out of my ſelfe into thee

               A GODLIE INSTRVction,
conteining the ſumme of
all the diuinitie neceſſary for a
Chriſtian conſcience.
               Made by Iohn Bradford.
               A Man that is regenerate and
borne of GOD, the which
thing that euerie one of vs bee our
Baptiſme, the Sacrament of regeneration
doth require vnder paine
of damnation, and therefore let euerie
one of vs with the Virgin Marie
ſay. Bee it vnto mee O Lorde, according
to thy worde, according to the ſacrament
of baptiſme, wherin thou

                     〈◊〉
                  
againſt it as we ſhall be made
able of the Lorde, a man (I ſay) that
is regenerate, conſiſteth of two men,

(as a man may ſay) namely of the old
man,The old man. and of the newe man. The old
man is like to a mightie Giant, ſuch
a one as was Goliah,
                  The new man. for his birth
is now perfect: but the newe man is
like vnto a little child, ſuch a one as
was Dauid, for his birth is not yet
perfect, vntil the day of his generall
reſurrection.
               The olde man therefore is more
ſtronger,VVhy the olde man is ſtronger than the newe. luſtie and ſt
                     •
                  ring then is
the newe man, becauſe the birth of
the new man is but begun now, and
the olde man is perfectlie borne. And
as the oldeman is more ſtirring, luſtie
and ſtronger than the newe man:
ſo is the nature of him cleane contrarie
to the nature of the new man, as
being earthly and corrupt with Sathans
ſeed,In what reſpect one man is. the nature of the newe
man beeing heauenly and bleſſed
with the celeſtial 
                     •
                  eed of God. So
that one man, in as much as hee is

corrupt with the ſeede of the ſerpent
is an olde man:both an old man alſo a new man and in as much as he
is bleſſed with the ſeede of God from
aboue hee is a new man. And as, in
as much as hee is an olde man, he is
a ſinner and an enemie to God: ſo in
as much as he is regenerate, hee is
righteous and holie, and a friend to
God, the ſeede of God preſeruing
him from ſinne, ſo that he cannot ſin,
as the ſeede of the ſerpent, wherewith
he is corrupt euen from his
conception, inclineth him, yea, inforceth
him to ſinne, and nothing els but
to ſinne. So that the beſt parte in
man before regeneration, in Gods
fight is not onely an enemie, but enimitie
it ſelfe.
               One man therefore which i
                     •
                   regenerate,How one man may be called alwayes ſinfull 
                        〈◊〉
                      alwayes iuſt.
may well bee called alwayes
iuſt and alwayes ſinfull: iuſt in reſpect
of Gods ſeede and his regeneration:
ſinfull in reſpect of Sathans

ſeede and his firſt birth.Why the old man oftentimes preuayleth againſt the new man. Betwixt
theſe two men therefore, there is continuall
conflict and war moſt deadlie.
The fleſh and the olde man by
reaſon of his birth that is perfect,
doe often for a time preuaile againſt
the new man (being but a childe in
compariſon) and that in ſuch ſort, as
not onely other,The olde man ſo mightily preuayleth ſomtimes againſt the new man in the children of god, that the ſpirit & ſeed of God ſeemeth to be vtterlie taken from thé whereas indeede it is not ſo, as afterward, to their great cō
                     fort they find and feele but euen the children
of God themſelues thinke that
they be nothing els but old, and that
the ſpirit and ſeed of God is loſt and
gone away, where yet notwitſtanding
the truth is otherwiſe, the ſpirite
and the ſeed of God, at the length
appearing againe, and diſpelling awaye
the cloudes which couer the
Sunne of Gods ſeede from ſhining,
as the cloudes in the aire doe the corporall
Sunne: ſo that ſometimes a
man cannot tel by any ſenſe, that the
                     •
                  
is any ſunne, the cloudes and windes
ſo hidet
                     •
                   it from our fight: Euen ſo

our cecitie or blindneſſe, and corrupt
affections doe often ſhadow the ſight
of Gods ſeede in Gods children, as
though they were plaine reprobates.
Whereof it commeth that they praying
according to their ſenſe, but not
according to the trueth, deſire of God
to giue them againe his ſpirite, as
though they had loſt it, and hee had
taken it away. VVhich thing God
neuer doth indeed although hee make
vs to think ſo for a time: for alwaies
he holdeth his hand vnder his children
in their falles, that they lie not
ſtill as other do which are not regenerate.
And this is the difference betwixt
Gods children, which are regenerate
aud elect before all times in
Chriſt, and the wicked caſt awayes:
that the elect lie not ſtill continuallie
in their ſin, as doe the wicked, but at
the length doe returne again by reaſon
of Gods ſeede, which is in them

hid as a ſparke of fire in the aſhes: as
we may ſee in Peter, Dauid, Paule, Marie
Magdalen, and others. For theſe
(I meant Gods children) God hath
made all things in Chriſt Ieſu: to
whome hee hath giuen this dignity,
that they ſhould be his inheritance
and ſpouſes. This our inheritour
Chriſt Ieſus, God with God, light
of light, coeternall & conſubſtantiall
with the father and with the holie
Ghoſt, to the end that he might become
our huſband (becauſe the Huſband
and the Wife muſt be one body
and fleſh) hath taken our nature vpon
him, communicating with it and
by it in his owne perſon, to vs all
his children, his diuine maieſtie (as
Peter ſaith) and ſo is become fleſh
of our fleſh, & bone of our bones ſubſtantiallie,
as wee are become fleſh
of his fleſh, and bone of his bones
ſpiritually: al that euer we haue perteining

to him▪ yea euen our ſinnes,
as all that euer he hath, perteining
vnto vs, euen his whole glorie. So
that if Sathan ſhould ſummon vs
to anſwere in our debts, and ſinnes▪
in that the wife is no ſuable perſon,
but the huſband, wee may well bid
him enter his action againſt our huſband
Chriſt, and he will make him
a ſufficient anſwer.
               For this ende (I meane that wee
might be coupled and maried thus
to Chriſt, and ſo be certaine of ſaluation,
and at peace with God in our
conſciences) God hath giuen his holy
word which hath two parts (as
now the children of God doe conſiſt
of two men) the one part of Gods
word being proper to the old man,The law pertaineth to the olde man, and the Goſpell to the new man. &
the other part of Gods word beeing
proper to the newe man. The parte
properlie pertaining to the old man
is the lawe: the part properly perteining

to the new man, is the Goſpell.
The law is a doctrine which commaundeth
and forbiddeth,VVhat the Law is. requiring,
doing, and auoyding. Vnder it therfore
are conteined al precepts, threatnings,
promiſes vpon conditions of
our doing and auoyding. &c.
               The Goſpell is a doctrine which
alwayes offereth and giueth, requireng
on our behalf,VVhat the Goſpel is. not as of worthineſſe
or as a cauſe, but as a certificate
vnto vs, and therefore vnder it are
contained all the free and ſweet promiſes
of God. as I am the Lord thy
God,
                  The conſcience feared & beaten downe with the terror of Gods iudgmēt againſt ſin, maie not look vpon the law, but fly to the Goſpell for relief and comfort, 
                  &c.
               
               In thoſe that be of yeares of diſcretion
it requireth faith, not as a
cauſe, but as an inſtrument whereby
we ourſelues may be certaine of our
good huſband Chriſt, and of his glorie:
and therefore when the conſcience
feeleth it ſelfe diſquieted for
feare of Gods iudgement againſt ſin

ſhe may in no wiſe looke vpon the
doctrine pertaining to the olde man,
but to the doctrine onely that pertaineth
to the newe man, in it not
looking for that which it requireth,
that is, faith, becauſe wee neuer beleeue
as wee ſhould: but onely on it
which it offereth, & which it giueth
that is, on Gods grace and eternall
mercie and peace in Chriſt Ieſu. So
ſhall ſhe be in quiet when ſhe looketh
for it altogether out of her ſelfe in
gods mercy in chriſt Ieſu:
                     John. 13 in whoſe
lap if ſhe lay her head with S. Iohn
then is ſhee happie,When the conſcience is quiet & at peace with god the Law ſerueth onely to keepe down the olde man. and ſhall finde
quietneſſe in deede. When ſhe feeleth
her ſelfe quiet, then (in Gods name)
let her looke on the lawe, and vpon
ſuch things as it requireth, thereby
to bridle and keepe, downe the olde
Adam, to ſtay the Goliah: frō whom
ſhe muſt needs keepe the ſweet promiſes,
being the bed wherein her

ſpouſe & ſhe 
                     〈…〉
                   lie together. For
as the wife 
                     〈◊〉
                   keepe her bed onelie
for her huſband, although in other
things ſhe is contented to haue fellowſhip
with others, as to ſpeak, ſit,
eate, drinke, go, &c. ſo our conſciences
which are chriſts wiues, muſt needs
keep the bed, that is, goes ſweet promiſes
all only for our ſelues and our
huſband, there to meete together, to
imbrace and laugh together, and to be
ioyful together. If ſinne, the lawe,
the deuill, or any thing els woulde
creepe into the bed and lye there, then
complaine to thy huſbande Chriſt,
and foorthwith thou ſhalt ſee him,
play Phinees part. Thus my dearly
beloued,Num. 2, 5 I haue giuen you in few
wordes, a ſumme of all the Deuinity
which a Chriſtian
conſcience cannot
want.
