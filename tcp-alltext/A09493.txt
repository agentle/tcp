And of the increaſe of the Chriſtian Faith in thoſe parts.

            IN my former Letters I made relation to your Reuerence, not onely of the ſtate of this our Miſſion into Perſia, and the bordering Kingdomes, where by the goodneſſe of Almighty God, wee haue labourers who diligently trauell in the Vineyard of our Lord: but alſo I haue further ſignified vnto you, the fruit and increaſe which dayly proceedeth from our labours, ſometimes by Preaching, Teaching and baptizing Mahometans, whoſe conuerſion is moſt hard: Other ſometimes by reducing the poore deceiued ſoules of the Armenians, Neſtorians, Iacobites, and other ſuch like, vnto the Faith of Chriſt, which are heere in great number; and haue little of Chriſtianity, more then the Name; amongſt whom wee doe much good, and gather great plenty of fruit into the ſtorehouſe of our Lord, which is the greateſt comfort wee inioy in theſe Deſarts of Infidelity.
            This onely heretofore, hath beene a diſcomfort vnto vs, that this our

Miſſion on our behalfes, hath gone on too fauourably, and hath not beene accompanied with tortures, torments, Impriſonments, and effuſion of our Blood, for the Goſpell of Chriſt which we profeſſe, and deſire to plant in theſe partes; as we reade of in other Miſſions; and are neceſſary for vs to ſuffer, aſwell for the teſtimony of the Truth, as for the edification of others; and incouraging them to bee conſtant in the Faith; which hitherto God hath not beſtowed vpon vs, though we often deſire it at his hands, for confirmation of his Truth.
            True, it is, that heretofore there hath not beene wanting, nor yet at this preſent there is wanting, occaſions, and opportunities, to merit, and to offer ſomething to our Lord: yet generally the King heere though a Mahometan, hath heretofore alwayes ſhewed towards vs, ſo great ſignes of affection and loue; that for our ſakes he hath not moleſted any Chriſtian, vnder the name and title of a Chriſtian: But if at any time hee hath conſtrained ſome of the Armenians to

deny their Faith; he hath done it vnder colour, that they haue otherwiſe diſpleaſed him, or for that they had not wherewithall to pay him, that which they ought, or vnder ſome other pretext; vntill now of late within theſe few dayes, it hath pleaſed his Diuine Maieſty in part, to heare our Prayers, and to comfort his Children, by giuing them a taſte of the ſweetneſſe, which thoſe inioy, who ſhed their blood, and yeeld their liues for his loue, though it hath not beene fully accompliſhed in vs, yet ſo it is that he hath giuen vs a little taſte, to ſtrengthen our hopes, that hereafter it may be fully accompliſhed in vs; for not many dayes agoe, he hath bleſſed this Miſſion with the happy Death of fiue Martyrs, and watered it with their Blood: ſo that now wee hope that it will yeeld a moſt plentifull harueſt, to the great content of all our Congregation, but eſpecially to your Reuerence who hath beene ſo great a fauourer of it.
            Amongſt other Perſians which in theſe laſt Monthes we haue Baptized

heere at Haſpahan; there were fiue (that is to ſay) Elia, Chaſſadir, (his Cozen) Alexander, Ioſeph, and Hebrani. Elia hath ſerued vs ſometimes in our houſe, and was the Husband of that Thereſa, of which I made mention in my former Letters, who was likewiſe Baptized by our Fathers; and after Baptiſme God gaue her ſo great Zeale; that like an Apoſtolike Woman, ſhee preached and publiſhed the Name of Ieſus Chriſt in all places; and trauailing into her Countrey, which is a Prouince of the Ringdome of Sciras, ſubiect to the King of Perſia, ſhe conuerted diuers, and with the reſt the aforeſaid Chaſſadir, and in thoſe partes enkindled in them ſuch a deſire of Chriſtianity, as that the Gouernour of that Prouince ſent diuers times, and laſtly his owne proper Sonne to our Fathers in Haſpahan, earneſtly intreating them to ſend two Fathers vnto them, to the intent to teach them the Faith of Ieſus Chriſt; which at that time could not be executed, becauſe the King of Perſia was then incenſed againſt the Portugals,
               
preparing to wage war againſt them in Ormus, (being an Iſland of the King of Spaines in the Eaſt Indies, ſomewhat further diſtant from the firme land, then his other Kingdomes are) as accordingly he ſhortly afterward performed.
            Theſe foreſaid fiue Chriſtians being Baptized at ſeuerall times, and inſtructed for ſome weekes, in the myſteries of the holy faith, departed to make their aboade in their owne houſes. But we perceiuing the Kings indignation to increaſe againſt the Francans (Francks in Perſia are called the Christians that follow the cuſtome of the Latines, to diſtinguiſh them from the Greekes, Armenians, and others) thought it more ſafe, for them to retire themſelues to Ormus▪
                thereby both to ſecure themſelues from the Kings fury, and the better▪ alſo to confirme them in the holy faith: To this effect Father Iohn of St. Eliſeus (who hath bin long times Vicar generall of the reformed Carmelits in theſe Countries) wrote vnto our Fathers, who reſided there▪ and

to a Captaine of Ormus, that they would entertaine them, and prouide for them there, vntill the Kings indignation was ouer-paſſed. Hee ſent his Letters by Elia, as by one who beſt knew the wayes, and the practiſe of the Country, and in whom he put the more confidence, for that he had ſerued in our houſe. Elia trauailed onwards with great alacrity, although hee fore-ſaw the great perill, whereunto he was expoſed, for at that time the Country was all in Armes, and Ormus was beſieged by the Perſians. But the ardent deſire, which this ſeruant of God had to endure any thing whatſoeuer for his ſake, made him ſet light by al dangers, and thence-forth chuſing only for his Cōpanion in the iourney, his aforeſaid Couſin Caſſadir, he went cheerefully forward, vntill that in his way, he was diſcouered by an Engliſh-man, whereof ſome are reſident in Perſia, to trafficke with the King for Silke, which they finde there, and brought to be accuſed before the Chan, that is to ſay▪ the Duke that gouerned the ſaid

Kingdome of Sciras, in the name of the King of Perſia, as his Vice-roy, who was going to the ſiege of Ormus, who preſently ſhut him vp in priſon, and ſearching him, found the Letters, which after he had peruſed, he cauſed him to be racked, and asked him what he was? Elia anſwered that he was a Francke, whereupon the Chan or Duke commaunded him, that hee ſhould ſpeake in the language of a Francke, but being ignorant of the language, he pawſed a while, and then ſaid, that he was a Christian Francke, (which is as much as to ſay, in the Perſian tongue, a Chriſtian Catholique, or one that yeeldeth obedience to the Pope) afterwards the Chan asked Caſſadir, Couſin to Elia, what he was, and whither he went, and vpon what affaires? and finding him to be a Chriſtian newly Baptized, who went to accompany his Couſin, and that they had no other buſineſſe, but to carie the Letters hee found about them, out of the hatred hee bore to Chriſtians: the Chan begun to be enraged like a dogge, and endeauoured

by diuers meanes, that is to ſay, by threatnings, torments, perſwaſions, and promiſes, to make theſe two new Diſciples of Ieſus Christ, to deny the holy faith, and to returne to the falſe obſeruance of Mahomet: But GOD (who neuer abandoneth thoſe which trauaile for him, and put their truſt in him) fauoured them with ſo great aboundance of his graces, that they ſet light by the threats, and torments, and reſpected not the promiſes of the Tyrant; but freely confeſſed that they were Chriſtians, and that GOD had ſhewed his fauour vnto them, to draw them out of the darkneſſe of infidelity, and the falſe ſect and doctrine of Mahomet, to the end they might know the true and onely faith of Ieſus Christ, in which they were both of them reſolued to liue and dye.
            The words of Elia like darts pierced the heart of the Chan▪ who inraged with new indignation, commaunded them to be caried into the ſight of Ormus, (eight dayes diſtant from that place where they were at

that time) and in the preſence of the Chriſtians of that Citie to bee put to death, in ſuch manner, as heare after ſhall bee declared. In theſe eight dayes of trauaile they were moſt inhumanely handled and iniured, induring hunger, thirſt, and watching, to which the cruell inſtruments of the diuell, fierce in heart, and ſauage in behauiour, added another more greater, which was to labour diuers times, to take from them the precious treaſure of the ſacred faith▪ ſometimes by threats, other whiles by promiſes, now by flatteries, and againe by ſtripes, vnder pretext to make them Runnagates and Apoſtataes. But theſe true ſeruants of God, tried like fine gold in the midſt of ſo many perſecutions, ſuffered and indured all theſe cruelties, with ioy of ſpirit, and vnſpeakeable conſtancie, yeelding thankes to our good Lord Ieſus Christ, for the grace he beſtowed on them, in making them worthy to ſuffer, and endure anything for his loue, and for the holy faith, which they had receiued in Baptiſme.

Being argued in ſight of Ormus, theſe fierce and cruell miniſters flayed an Aſſe, and ſowed the Martyr Elia in the skinne, and afterwards nayled him on high to a great peece of wood: he liued in this moſt cruell torment ſome houres, praiſing and bleſſing God, and preaching the faith of Ieſus Christ, after the beſt manner he could. Caſſadir was alwayes preſent at this ſpectacle, who in ſtead of aſtoniſhment, and looſing his courage, for the torments that were inflicted vpon his Couſin, was the more animated, and remained alwayes conſtant, confeſſing Ieſus Christ, and reiecting with an holy diſdaine, all thoſe that counſailed him to returne vnto the Sect of Mahomet, which was the cauſe that they tyed him to a Stake, and ripped vp his belly. Thus thoſe two holy Martyrs finiſhed their fraile life, to the end to poſſeſſe and begin another eternall, and happy; inſomuch as the miniſters of cruelty, and thoſe other Infidels that were there preſent, remained confuſed and aſtoniſhed, at the conſtancie of thoſe

two Martyrs. I could not as yet vnderſtand what became of the bodies of theſe two glorious Martyrs, but I hope that God will preſerue and reſerue ſo great a treaſure.
            The Chan of Sciras being informed by theſe two glorious Martyrs Elia, and Caſſadir, what thoſe three other Chriſtians were, which according to the Fathers Letters, were to be ſent to Ormus, and hauing notice both of their names, by which they were baptized, as for the others, they had when they were yet Mahometans, ſignified the whole proceedings by his Letters to the King of Perſia, and ſent him thoſe Letters which the holy Martyr Elia was to carie to Ormus. The King hauing receiued this newes (who at that time was three Leagues from the Citie) commanded the foreſaid three Chriſtians to be apprehended, who were not as yet departed, and commanded the Daraga (that is to ſay, the Gouernour of the Citie of Haspaphan) and the Captaine of the Campe, to repaire vnto our Couent, and ſhut vs vp therein:

which they punctually performed, locking, and ſealing vp the Cells of the Couent, and ſhutting all of vs together in one Chamber: After this, they asked Father Iohn, whether hee thought he had done well, or that it were fitting, that hee ſhould be the cauſe of ſuch a matter, conſidering that the King had alwayes entertained, and honoured him? Wherevnto the Father anſwered, that hee came not into Perſia for the honours and fauours which the King had beſtowed on him; but for the only hope he had, not only to conuert the King, but his whole Kingdome to the faith of Ieſus Christ. With this anſwer the Gouernour and the Captaine of Iuſtice, departed, leauing the Monaſtarie full of Souldiers: God ſo would that one of the Fathers was yet faſting (notwithſtanding that it was more then two of the clocke afternoone) and thus conſumated hee the holy Sacrament. That night they forbad vs to performe our accuſtomed ſpirituall exerciſes, beleeuing that we would ſet ſome Charmes, and Sorceries

a worke. Yet did wee that which vpon ſuch like occaſion, the Prophet. Daniel did. Your Reuerence may conſider in what eſtate we were, the houſe being full of Watchmen, and Sergeants that were Infidels, the gates of the Monaſtarie locked, when as we might not ſpeake to any of our friends, or know what was done, but were all of vs cloſed vp in a Chamber, preparing our ſelues to giue our liues for Ieſus Chriſt. One onely thing afflicted vs, which was, that wee could not giue ſuccours to the new Chriſtians▪ knowing for certaine, that they ſuffered great neceſſity of all things, and for that wee could not counſell, and animate them, being doubtfull of their perſeuerance in the faith.
            At that time, wee betooke our ſelues to our prayers, beſeeching our Lord to giue them force, and perſeuerance, offering vp our prayers to the two holy Martyrs Elia, and Caſſadir, to the end they ſhould interceede, and pray for them. Wee remained priſoners thus, for three dayes ſpace,

during which time, each of vs prepared himſelfe to dye, and made a generall confeſſion after the beſt manner we could. The firſt day we read the life of St. Ignatius the Martyr, the ſecond of St. Lawrence, and the third that of St. Katherine. I cannot expreſſe vnto you the conſolation, and inward ioy that we felt, nor the feruour, or ſenſible apprehenſion and zeale of the Fathers: euery houre was vnto vs a thouſand, whilſt we expected to giue vp our liues for Ieſus Christs ſake, and no leſſe able am I to expreſſe vnto you, the deſire which we had, that our deaths might be accompanied with many torments, neither the feruent acts which we did to that effect. We taſted (deare Father) of the force, and efficacie of Gods grace▪ and the fidelity which God vſeth towards thoſe who expoſe themſelues to dangers, by the meanes of holy obedience; in ſuch ſort, that mee thought I ſaw, that which in ſuch like occations God operated in the Primitiue Church.
            The ſecond day of our impriſonment,

the King ſent theſe Letters to Father Iohn (by a Secretarie, to the Gouernour of the Citie) which hee had written by the holy Martyr Elia to Father Baltaſer, and the Captaine of Ormus, with the interpretation of the ſame, but vnfaithfully and corruptly tranſlated by the direction of the Chan of Sciras, commanding him to certifie him, whether theſe Letters were his, and whether they were well interpreted, and that hee ſhould interpret them himſelfe, and call to his remembrance what honours and fauours he had done him, and whether this was the acknowledgement which he ought him, and the reward of the bread and ſalt they had eaten together; intending hereby, how often times the King had inuited our Fathers to eate with him, perticularly vpon the occaſions of the arriuall of great Ambaſſadours, and at Feaſts, at which time, the King is accuſtomed to make great banquets, to which hee alwayes inuited Father Iohn, with ſome other Fathers, honouring them very much vpon ſuch like

occaſions, placing them alwayes neere himſelfe, feaſting them at his owne diſh, and doing ſuch like things: (This is a phraſe amongſt the Perſians to ſay, they inuite them to eate bread and ſalt, when they inuite to a banquet.) Father Iohn read the interpretation of his owne Letters▪ which the King had ſent him, and finding them full of lyes, and falſhoods; hee interpreted them, and ſignified to the Meſſenger, which was ſent vnto him by the King, that hee acknowledged the graces, and honours which he had alwayes receiued at his Maieſties hands, that thoſe were his Letters; and that it was true, that he had baptized thoſe fiue. And being demanded why he Baptized them? the Father anſwered: why doth the King inforce Chriſtians to forſake their faith, and become Mahometans? as his Maieſtie endeauoureth for Mahomet, ſo will I doe my vttermoſt for Ieſus Chriſt, in whoſe place I am here ſet: and for this cauſe, who ſo euer they be, that deſire to become Chriſtians, thoſe will I freely baptize, being

onely ſent into theſe Countries, with theſe my Companions, to that intent. The Miniſters deliuered the anſwere, which the Father ſent to the King, who was highly contented, both with the interpretation which the Father had made of his owne Letters, which he had ſent vnto Ormus, (being much different from thoſe which were ſent him by the Chan of Sciras, tranſlated wholy into a contrary ſence, and as it may be thought, by ſome enemies of our holy faith) as alſo with his conſtancie, and for that cauſe, the King ſaid the Father had reaſon.
            Full two hundred Mulaz (which are the Doctors of Mahomets law) were preſent with the King, when the Fathers anſwere was brought vnto him, who making ſome tumult, and noyſe; and almoſt mad with anger, were aſſembled there, to the end to complaine vnto his Maieſtie, for that the law of Mahomet grew out of requeſt, and for that we had ſent more then fiue thouſand baptized Perſians into Chriſtendome, inciting him to remedy

the ſame, and prouoking his diſpleaſure againſt vs. The King being much diſpleaſed, turning himſelfe towards them (after hee had heard the Fathers anſwere) reuiled, and taunted them with bitter ſpeeches, telling them, that the Father had reaſon; but that they were villaines, and old crafty Foxes, commaunding them out of his preſence: ſaying, for ſixteene yeeres ſpace, I haue frequented the Fathers company, yet hath he neuer told me any vntruth, neither haue I found any ill beſeeming behauiour amongſt the Fathers, and I hold them for honeſt men. Hereupon the Mulaz departed, confuſed: At this time the King expreſſed the affection which hee bare to Father Iohn, which truly is very great, whereupon wee ſuppoſe, that the ſeuerity which at this preſent he ſheweth, and heretofore vſed towards the Chriſtians his Subiects, as to the Armenians and others, euill intreating them, and permitting ſometimes, that their children ſhould be made ſlaues, and forcing ſome of them to deny their faith, is to

no other end, but to giue ſome ſatiſfaction to the Mulaz, and the people; in that hee feareth ſome reuolt, hauing perticularly diſcouered diuers times conſpiracies againſt himſelfe, whereby he ſtoode in danger both of his life, and Kingdome, wherein one of his ſonnes was intended to be placed, which hath beene the cauſe that he hath put two of his ſons to death, and as it is preſumed, hath cauſed the third in like ſort to be ſlaine, to the intent to leaue one of his eldeſt ſonnes children, to ſucceede him in the Kingdome, who as yet is a little Infant, and incapable of the Empire.
            True it is alſo, that the King naturally is both angry and chollericke, both by reaſon of the conſpiracies which haue beene alſo addreſſed againſt him, as for the death which he hath inflicted on his owne naturall children, ſo that this paſſion hath gotten ſo great power ouer him, that ſometimes he ſeemeth to be out of his wits, and at that time acteth beaſtly reſolutions. All theſe thinges being thus paſt betwixt the King, and the

Father, the King commaunded thoſe three priſoners to be brought before him, that were impriſoned in the Citie of Haspahan, by reaſon of the intelligence the Chan of Sciras had giuen him, together with theſe ſixe other, who deſired to bee Chriſtians, and were ready to receiue ſacred baptiſme, being for this cauſe alſo committed to priſon. The King himſelfe asked them whether they were Chriſtians or no? to whom theſe Catechumen▪
                anſwered together, with two of the three other Chriſtians, (that is to ſay Ioſeph, and Hebrain) that they were none; Alexander onely anſwered with great courage, that he was a Chriſtian. The King commaunded him to forſake his faith, and to returne to Mahometiſme: Whereupon Alexander, with greater feruour, and freeneſſe of ſpirit, ſaid, that he would neuer commit ſuch a ſinne, as to ſeperate himſelfe from the true faith of Ieſus Christ, for the falſe Doctrine of Mahomet, and that he hoped through the mercy of God, to liue and die a Chriſtian. The King▪ being ſtrangely

moued by this free and confident anſwere (as one who was vnaccuſtomed to heare replyes, and contradictions to his commaundements) ſentenced him to bee preſently ſtoned to Death, and afterwards burned to Aſhes. The miniſters ſodainly executed the Kings commaund, and happy Alexander publiquely confeſſing Ieſus Chriſt, gaue him thankes, for that hee thought him worthy to looſe his life for his ſake. We cānot as yet, learne the other particularities of this glorious ſeruant of God, becauſe the Execution was ſodaine, and without the Citty: wee onely know that the Reliques are in the handes of the Chriſtians, and are kept by them with honour and reuerence.
            The other eight (that is to ſay) the two Chriſtians and the ſixe Catechumens, who had beene brought before the King, with the holy Martyr Alexander, were by his Maieſties commaundment led vnto Father Iohn, to know which were the two that were Baptized, for all of them had denyed themſelues to be Chriſtians. We thus

locked vp as wee haue ſignified vnto you, the next day following about an houre within Night, whileſt we were occupied in mentall Prayer which we vſe to make for one houre in the Euening and another in the Morning; behold the Eight inchayned Priſoners, together with the miniſters of Cruelty, came vnto vs, commaunding the Father to certifie them, which of thoſe were the two Chriſtians. The Father animated and exhorted them, to confeſſe the true and holy Faith, which he had taught them, and that God had engraued in them by holy Baptiſme, and which they, with ſo much gladnes, had at that time teſtified; and alſo ſhewed vnto them, that it was not lawfull for Chriſtians to deny the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, at ſuch time as they are conſtrained to confeſſe the ſame, and afterwards hee tolde theſe whom the King had ſent, that Ioſeph and Hebrain were the two, which he had Baptized (for the Father knew that the King was well informed of all) one of theſe two relented a little, becauſe

the Father had diſcouered him, vttering forth certaine wordes, whereby hee diſcouered his apprehenſion of the danger, the other ſpake not one word. Heere we haue an occaſion, wonderfully to admire the meanes which his Diuine Maieſty vſed at this time, to aſſiſt thoſe two ſoules, and to crowne them with the crowne of holy Martyrdome, prouoking euen the very miniſters of Cruelty, who led them to Martyrdome, to animate them vnto Death for the loue of Ieſus Chriſt; for one of them ſaid, be not afraid of Death, becauſe it is our moſt aſſured heritage: Thou art a Chriſtian, dye then in the Faith of Ieſus Chriſt; Another ſaid this life paſſeth in a moment, you ſhall goe and liue with Ieſus Chriſt: The laſt ſaid, Ieſus Chriſt is aliue, and is not dead as Mahomet is; continue conſtant, and you ſhall aſcend to the fourth Heauen of Ieſus Chriſt.
            
            The next day earely in the morning, they brought vs backe the Eight that were chayned together, and with them a Portugall called Sebaſtian

Duz, taken Priſoner by the Kings Souldiers in his Warres, and for that cauſe detained in Priſon in Haspahan; this did God ordaine for his greater Glory, and the ayde of theſe new Chriſtians: Father Iohn, iſſued out of the Gate, with Bread to diſtribute amongſt them, and to refreſh them a little, but the Catechumens would take none, yet did Ioſeph and Hebrain receiue the ſame, and gaue thereof likewiſe to Sebaſtian Duz, entertaining Father Iohn with a ioyfull countenance, and great contentment, who called all the other Fathers and Religious, for the common conſolation of all, and after he had exhorted the two Chriſtians to perſeuerance, and without feare to confeſſe their God and Sauiour, who gaue himſelfe for our Redemption, and to eſteeme it to bee a great grace and bleſſing to be reputed his Martyrs, and to remember themſelues of the vertue, courage, and conſtancy, of their three companions, Elia, Caſſadir, and Alexander, who like glorious Saints, enioy and for euer ſhall enioy Eternall glory: whoſe

interceſſion he promiſed them, as alſo our prayers; but aboue all the ayde and aſſiſtance of Ieſus Chriſt in their paſſion, and that their torments would ſeeme ſweet, and pleaſant vnto them: After this each one with teares in our eyes, imbraced each other, enuying their happines, and reputing our ſelues not worthy of ſo great a fauour, we tooke our leaue of them, and they departed comforted, ioyfull, and inueſted with a new Spirit; but we remained ſad and afflicted, for that we were depriued of the Crowne of Martyrdome, which wee ſo much deſired: wee ſetled our ſelues to prayers, to aſſiſt them the beſt that wee could, conſidering that it was not permitted to vs, to doe otherwiſe, neither to accompany them as wee deſired, and as we endeauored to doe. But Sebaſtian Duz ſufficiently ſupplyed our places, heartning, comforting, and inciting them alwayes to behaue themſelues like the true ſouldiers of Ieſus Chriſt.
            
            They two with the other ſeauen, which were in chaynes, that is to ſay,

               Sebaſtian Duz, with the ſixe Catechumens in religion, were led through the Citty of Haspahan, and turned three times about the ſame, and were then conueyed to the Kings preſence, meane while Sebaſtian Duz with the two new Chriſtians, confeſſed alwayes (both paſſing thorough the Citty, and in the way, with a loude voyce, and in the Kings preſence) the Name of Ieſus Chriſt. The King ſeeing this, commaunded that Ioſeph and Hebrain, ſhould bee ſtoned to Death, and their Bodyes to be burned, and that Sebaſtian Duz, with the ſixe Catechumens, ſhould be led backe to Priſon: and to this purpoſe it was Proclaimed throughout the Citty of Haſpahan, that thoſe that loued Mahomet ſhould repaire to the Execution place, with Stones to chaſtice thoſe, who had denyed the Faith of Mahomet. Being arriued at the place where this Execution of theſe two happy Chriſtians, was to bee performed, The Gouernour of the Citty who is an Apoſtata, and hath abiured Chriſtian Religion,

alighted from his Horſe, & taking the Mulaz with him to aſſ
                  ••
               t him, enforced himſelfe to perſwade theſe two Martyrs, to make profeſſion of the Law of Mahomet, attempting them, with their ordinary, carnall, and temporall reaſons, promiſing them not onely their liues, and the Kings pardon, but alſo great Rewards, conſidering that not onely the matter concerned and hazarded their reputation, but alſo the credit of their Prophet Mahomet: Ioſeph anſwered with great courage, ſaying; That although he were the firſt that denyed himſelfe to bee a Chriſtian, at ſuch time as the King queſtioned him thereupon, yet now in no ſort hee would commit ſuch an errour, for that the offence he had committed was too great already, when in the Kings preſence hee had denyed himſelfe to bee a Chriſtian, hoping that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who had ſhewed him ſo much fauour, as to call him to become a Chriſtian, would now giue him grace and force to ſuffer Death for his loue: Whereupon

they that were about him, and particularly the Mulaz tooke vp ſtones to ſtone him, which, whileſt they performed, the Saint hauing his Head already broken and in peeces, cryed out with a loude voyce: Bleſſed bee the holy Name of Ieſus, his Faith is holy and true; and that of Mahomets is falſe, and no man can be ſaued thereby; But Brethren God pardon you, and giue you his holy light: telling them further, that hee felt no paine. Hebrain, that was the laſt to dye for Ieſus Chriſt, was tempted and likewiſe aſſaulted anew, to deny the holy Faith, and to profeſſe and proteſt that of Mahomet, whereunto hee anſwered; that he would not doe it, and that hee was a true Diſciple of Ieſus Chriſt, the true God, and true Man, wiſhing them, that they ſhould not looſe any more time to perſwade him to ſuch lyes, and that they ſhould not delay any longer, to beſtow that Crowne on him, which his companions enioyed in Paradice, and that he was diſpoſed to ſhed his Blood for him, and for his Loue, who with ſo

great exceſſe of loue▪ had giuen his Corporall life for them and him, to the end to giue them an Eternall life: And whileſt they bound and faſtned him to the ſtake, he ſaid to the Miniſters of his Execution, that hee pardoned them, and deſired that God would not demaund accompt of his Blood at their hands. It is impoſſible to expreſſe with what rage theſe Miniſters of the Deuill ſtoned this holy Martyr, out of the diſpite they had, for that they could not peruert him, whereupon they remained wholly confuſed and derided by all men. Hauing ſtoned theſe two Saints, they burned their Bodyes, and ſet a watch ouer the reliques and aſhes of the Saints, yet notwithſtanding the Chriſtians gathered them all vp, ſo that nothing was left vnpreſerued.
            The Kings Miniſters repented themſelues for that they had Executed the Martyrs, becauſe they did not beleeue, that ſo great a conſtancy could bee in the Saints, conſidering the torments which they ſuffered,

and the rather, becauſe they ſaw ſo great a murmure amongſt the people, who flocked together in great multitudes, to ſee the ſpectacle they had neuer ſeene, and they openly ſaid, that the faith of the Chriſtians was more ſtrong, and better then theirs: Whilſt this Martyrdome was a doing, wee that were locked vp, and guarded by our ordinary Watchmen, prayed God that his holy name might be ſanctified in theſe his Saints. Not long after this the King departed and went to Kanda, where his Army attended him; but before his departure, hee cauſed the Catechumens in Chriſtian Religion, to be ſet at liberty, and ordained, that not onely they ſhould haue their free liberty, but that they ſhould be honoured, and and left free as they were before, to doe their offices in our Church. Signifying hereby, that what hee had done, hee had done againſt his will. But as we remained in the Miniſters hands, and the King was farre diſtant from vs, they left vs one of the guard in the 
                  •••
               ent, ſaying, that the King

had ſo commaunded them, but this was not a guard but a Mamonda (that is to ſay a guard of gueſts or ſtrangers) and for this cauſe the Chriſtians frequented not our Church, as they were accuſtomed. But GOD draweth the beſt from all things, for by this perſecution, wee haue gotten the loue of diuers Perſians, and are in good reputation with them, and thoſe that kept vs, teſtifie our pouerty in all places, and that we are good Chriſtians, which wee could not haue obtained in our proſperity. The ſenſible apprehenſion that all the Citie ſheweth, giues vs great occaſion to praiſe God, becauſe all of them thought, that wee ſhould haue beene put to death, by diuers torments. For going once along the Citie, and making ſome little walke, preſently after the death of theſe Martyrs, they all beheld vs, with ioy and contentment, and great reuerence, bleſſing GOD. Although as yet, wee are vnder the afore-ſaid guard, and in a manner impriſoned, yet doe we ſay our offices in the Church, and we ring our bells

(which are very good) as we did before, and as you doe in Europe, and notwithſtanding our need of money, wherewith we are preſſed, yet within theſe few dayes, wee haue bought a very good Bell, for feare leaſt the other ſhould bee broken, hoping in God that we ſhall one day ſee them, in the beſt Idolatrous Church in this Citie (that is to ſay) in the Synagogue of the Mahometans. Wee remaine very much comforted, and the rather becauſe wee already ſee the efficacie of the interceſſion, which thoſe fiue Martyrs make for this Miſſion, enioying the fruit of their bloud, wherwith it is watered, hoping to haue greater one day, and to ſee throughout this whole Kingdome, the holy Croſſe triumphantly erected, which God graunt for his great and infinite mercy ſake.
            The Parents of the Martyrs are very well affected towards vs, diuers of the moſt Learned and Principals of Haſpahan, ſend vs ſalutations, excuſing themſelues, that for the preſent they cannot come to ſalute vs in perſon,

becauſe as yet thoſe thinges that are paſt, are new, and freſh in memory: And although we are thus cloſed vp, I will not ſay Impriſoned, yet ſome haue not failed to come vnto vs (although with great danger) importuning vs to Baptize them. The Forty three Territories of the Armenian Chriſtians, who are vnder the Kings Obedience (as at other times I haue certified your Reuerence by my Letters) had playde the Apoſtataes, in another Perſecution, and were for the moſt part become Mahometans, (although as I beleeue it was not in heart) by the example of theſe fiue Martyrs, they haue all of them declared themſelues to bee Chriſtians, and proteſt they are ready to dye for CRHISTS ſake and his Loue. The King hath taken no notice hereof, but hath commaunded, that euery one ſhould liue according to that Faith wherein hee was borne, and to the aforeſaid Forty Territories, he hath made reſtitution of their Chriſtian Bookes, which the Perſians had taken from them, when they abjured.
            
               Theſe are the fruites of the Death, and interceſſion of theſe Fiue glorious Martyrs. There are ſome, that for the preſent labour to put this Information into an authenticall forme by a publique Notary, with many witneſſes, which were preſent at this famous Martyrdome, amongſt which there ſhall bee the Miniſters of the King: which once obtained, I will ſend it to your Reuerence, with all the other particularities that may be knowne, to the end, you may make vſe of them at Rome.
            
            I will certifie your Reuerence no further as touching the workmen in this Miſſion, leaſt I ſhould grow too tedious, but this, that they liue in great obſeruance, and with ſuch perfection, as if this houſe were a Nouiſhip, and they Nouices. They humbly require the Prayers of our Congregation, and eſpecially and particularly thoſe of your Reuerence, and your holy Benediction, in which wee haue much confidence. Beſeeching you to ſuccour this Miſſion, and to ſend labourers, for the Harueſt is

great, and your Reuerence may beleeue me, that ſometimes my heart burſteth (if I may ſo ſpeake it) with compaſſion ſeeing them ſtill crying out for the Bread of the ſacred Goſpell, and that wee cannot aſſiſt them all, as we earneſtly deſire: The zeale of your Reuerence permitteth me not to ſpeake any further, knowing what deſire you haue to aſſiſt this Miſſion, with the hazard of your blood. Our Lord reward you, and preſerue vs, as wee pray to that effect.
