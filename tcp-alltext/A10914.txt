according to the contents of this writing read and expounded by Daniel, was Balthazar that same night slaine, and the City vtterly destroyed, Dan. 5. Isa, 14. 4. 22. and 47. 11. and 21: 41 And that by this stratageme, while they were feasting, Cytus caused the riuer Buphrates to be diuided into diuers channels, and so made it pasable, and then his army passed ouer, and by the guiding of Gadata and Gobrias, they entred into the Cittie, and these two Courtiers slew him.
            
            See what security and slouth bringeth Vse. Gods iudgments are most neere to the wicked, when they thinke themselues most safe. vpon men and whole kingdomes, when no danger and warning (as Daniel telleth Balthasar) will serue, Dan. 5. 22. and therefore his vanie glorious feast, became his funerall feasts, and as of this Balthasar, so it fareth with all brutish and secure worldlings, and sensuall liuers this day, who though they liue in their sinns end thereupon in the Lords danger and hatred, and wot not how soone for their domerits, the Lord will by death take them away, & then bring them to iudgment, yet in this deadly taking are they so sleepy and secure, so full of ioy and

gladness, when they should giue themselues to fasting, weeping, & mourning, to preuent Gods iudgements, that they put farre from them the euill day, and approach to the seate of iniquitie, as though no euill The wicked euer hasten their owne destruction. could happen to them, giue themselues to feasting, ryot & excesse, that the Lord in the midst of their drunkenness taketh them suddenly away, most fearefully & vnprepared for death or finall iudgment but as they liued beastly, so they dye strangely.
            Wherefore purposing (the holy Trinitie assisting mee) to deliuer vnto you my brethren (holy and beloued in the Lord) some word of exhortation, and considering in respect of the premises) that the chiefest things euery one ought to be most careful of as long as they liue, are, first how to liue according to Gods holy will during our life heere.
            Secondly, how to leaue this life in Gods feare and fauour, and full hope of a better life: and Thirdly, how to be discharged before Gods tribunall in the day of iudgement, and so enioy life eternall.

                  〈◊〉
               , at this instant can thinke of nothing more behoofull, then to stirre vp your hearts to Christian watchfulnes, for the time present, and for the day of death, and of our appearing before the Sonne of God at the generall iudgement. Which taske if we faithfully perform, we shall be blessed in life, happy in death, yea, and for euer after death dwell with God in heauen. Now for the fundamentall ground of this exhortation. I chuse this Scripture, which directeth vs to examine.

               2 The meaning and parts thereof.
               3 The instructions and vses for knowledge and conscience wee are to gather hereof.
            
            And for the first, the occasion may be 1. gathered out of Math. 23 where our Sauiour denoūceth woes against the Scribes & Pharises, threatning them destruction and desolation. Whereat his Disciples being much astonied, thinke it vnpossible that their Temple should be destroyed

vnlesse the whole world should come to an end, and be destroyed with it, wherefore, as they departed out of the Temple one of his disciples shewed him how fortified the Temple was, how great were The Temple the statliest building in all the world. the stones, and strong the buildings; and indeed it was the stareliest, strongest, and brauest building in all the world, for besides that, all Kings and Princes of any name and fame, sent gifts to adorne and enrich it. Herod wonderfully repaired it, the building was of white marble stones which were each of them 25. Cubites long, eight Cubites high or thicke, and some 12.

His case is ours, we see all die and must come to iudgment, Heb. 9. 27. & 2. Cor. 5. 10. Rom. 14. 10. And shall we as great sinners as they looke to escape? No, no, we must hence: let vs prepare and make ready. The like lesson giueth Elisha to Gehazi. 2. King. 5. 26. 27. Shewing him this was no time to hoord wealth by hooke and crooke, but to fast and pray for his owne sinnes, and the sinnes of the whole land, and at no hand touch this pestilent leaprosie. I would to God we all semblably would consider that we were not sent to this world, to make our selues mighty men, as those giants before the flood. Gen. 6. 4. Nor yet borne as hogges in sties to be fatted, to eate, drinke, take our ease, and be merry as that rich Cob, Luke 12. 20. 20. Who thinking thus to liue to himselfe and for himselfe hard: (vnmercifull

wretch as he was) Oh foole, this night will they fetch away thy soule from thee, then whose shall those things be which thou hast prouided? a short and sore warning, yet his case is ours: we cast for many yeeres euery man for himselfe, yet are not sure to liue till the next morning: and the rather because we discharge not the busines, for which we were sent into this Why we were sent to the world. world, as to know God to glorifie his name, to be reconciled to his Maiestie, to worke our saluation, to beleeue in his name, to doe good to all men, and to repaire his gracious image in vs, and keepe his couenant, &c.
            Let vs not then no longer deceiue our selues with shadowes, nor foolishly delay, nor deferre any time to come to God, and no longer serue the Lord with smooky hay and stubble, 1.

            The second part concerneth the § 4. 2. Parte. This distribution of this Text. sense of the Text and meaning of this watch word, which we shall the readier find if we obserue the diuers acceptions, and sorts of watching as first.
            1 Almighty God watcheth ouer his 1. Church, continually, Psal. 121. 3. 4. 5 out. & 127. 2. As also he watcheth ouer his enemies, Ierem. 44. 27. Dan. 9. 14.

            4. Sathan watcheth to hurt and 4. harme vs, 1. Pet. 5. 8. And to find matter to accuse vs night and day, Reuel. 12 10.
            5. The elect watch, Psal. 102. 7. Prou. 
               5. 8. 33. Cantic. 5. 2.
            6. All creatures watch to defend 6. themselues from harmes, souldiors watch in the field, superiors watch ouer their inferiors, wicked men watch to

steale, &c. But the watch in this Scripturement, is when we carefully prepare our selues for the comming of the Sonne of God to iudgement, as is largely set downe in the former verses, Mar. 13. 33. to 37. Watch and pray for yee know not when the time is, for the Sonne of man is as a man going into a strange countrey, and leaueth his house, and giueth authority to his seruants, and to euery man his worke, and commandeth the porter to watch, watch yee therefore (for yee know not when the Maister of the house will come at euen, or at midnight at the Cockcrowing, or in the dawning) least if hee come suddenly he should find you sleeping: That is, vnprepared, as the fiue foolish Virgins, Matth. 25. 3. 8. And those presumptuous Hypocrits, Matth. 7. 22. The former without oyle in their lampes, the latter crauing olde acquaintance and deserts of the Iudge. But this watch we cannot keepe, vnlesse we before watch ouer our whole liues carefully, ordering the same according to Gods holy reuealed will; and with all, be carefull to leaue this life in most willing, faithfull, ioyfull, and godly manner, preparing

and waiting for a blessed departure hence, & expecting I for a better life after death, sutable to our former liues, and to this departure and resignation of our soules and bodies into his hands that gaue them vs; whereof it euidently appeareth by the premisses, that euery The subdiuision. Three watches. man and woman, hath three distinct watches to keepe.
            1. On ouer the whole course of our 1 liues from the beginning to the end.
            2. The other for death. 2
            
            3. And the third for our Sauiours 3 blessed comming to iudgment. From which three, we also may gather this discription of watching, to wit, that to What is it to watch. watch, is to be exceeding carefull and circumspect to behaue our selues all our life, holily, soberly, and iustly in all our actions, according to the Lords will expressed in his word, and euer to be heedfull to settle our selues in such a wise and constant religious state of life, that we may euer more, as good and faithfull seruants be found well occupied, and prepared both for death and our Lords comming to iudgement; without feare,

blame, or checke. And because these three watches must be managed and effected in our life and health time, and not in the houre of death, or vpon the day of iudgement. I will dilate of euery of them in order, but first intreate of some points in generall, which doe alike concerne these three sorts of watching, then descend to discuse of the perticulars.
            And because lightly no doctrine is much regarded, vnlesse it be knowne to Of watching in generall.

                God both all our life long, at our death, and appearing in iudgement, which being found necessarie, then it must consequently be profitable, and therefore pleasant, alluring, and binding all men and women, old and yong, to the practise thereof, vnlesse wilfully, and madly they runne vpon the pickes of their owné destruction, which the Lord forbid.

                  . Which teacheth, it is most necessarie to watch. 
               necessarie worke for all men liuing, to watch ouer their liues, during their aboade heere; as also for the time of their transmigration hence, and for their cheerefull and ioyfull appearing in iudgment, my proofes be these.
            First, because (as I shewed the second Proofes of the doctrine by Scripture and by reasons. in the exordium and enterance to this Sermon) these three points were the chiefest things which euery one ought to be most carefull of as long as they liue; and wherein standeth the glory of God: so much as of man ought to be sought for in this life: And therefore are most needfull.
            2. God commandeth vs in diuers places to watch, and pray, for these three ends, as heare Matth. 2. 4. 4. 2. Luke 12 36. & 21. 36. & 22 40. 46. & 1. Pet. 4. 7. & 5. 8. Ephes. 6. 18. & 1. Thess. 5. 6. 10. &c.

euery mans will, vnlesse he be a professed rebell, then God in the very creation of Man and Angels: put this bridle in the mouth of all reasonable creatures, that no man without extreame and manifest impudencie, durst gainsay, but humbly and speedily obay, any thing if it were apparantly knowne to be commanded by God; but this is knowne so to be, and therefore must be obayed.
            3. There is not a more effectuall doctrine to rouse the sluggard, then to heare the drumme of death, and Gods iudgement sounding in his secure soule and eares.
            4. Watchfulnes is profitable to stirre vs vp to serue God sincerely without Hypocrisie.
            2. It will cause vs to suruey our liues and iudge our selues.
            3. It will pull downe our pride, and cause vs loath the least thing that troubleth, or hindereth our reckoning in that day, whether of the first, or latter iudgement.
            4. It will cause vs make no account of this world, then of an Inne or baiting

place, but ioy to depart from i

               en haue fallen sorely, for want of watching.
            5. If I can watch without ceasing, I shall get in each action the peace of conscience, which is an vncomparable iewel, I shall be as a good steaward, accountable to God of my talents without distrust, I shall stop the mouths of my aduersaries, and cause my religion to be well spoken off, by my godly conuersation: and be ready when death summoneth, and God cals me to iudgement.
            The first vse, we are to make heereof, § 6. Vse 1. For admonition to all men. serues for admonition to all men, that seeing watchfulnes is thus necessarie, & profitable, that we awake from the sleepe of sinne, and death, and trimme vp our lampes to meete our blessed bridgroome, and no longer with the sluggard plead for sleepe, yet a little sleepe, a little slumber, a little foulling of the hands to sleepe, &c. Prou. 24. 33. Least pouerty commeth vpon vs as on that trauelleth

by the way, and necessity like an armed man.
            2. Seeing this doctrine concerneth all men generally, rich, as poore, wise, as foolish: all men are speedi y to watch and awake betimes, we see how euery man is ready and wise to coine excuses, to draw their neckes from vnder Christs yoake and burthen, how easie and light so euer, vsing all exceptions and exemptions, and so shift of this Mandate, as not appertaining vnto them, as now at least: and wi I not seeme to them so peremptorie, but in some cases admits relaxation, a common, but a pestilent sicknes, infecting all the sonnes of Adam: we see how Adam and Euah had their peraduentures and excuses, Gen 3. 3. The recusant ghuests had their vnmannerly demurres, and made light to come to the wedding, Luke 14. 24. Martha was busie in prouiding Christs dinner, Luke 10. 42. A good worke doubtles, but on thing was necessarie: the Lawyers could not abide to be rebuked, Luke 11. 45. And when our Sauiour exhorted all to watch: Peter expecting exemption to some, asketh if

he spake to all, Luke 12. 41. So likewise heere it is like they looked for a prerogatiue, but our Sauiour preuents them, saying. Those things that I say vnto you, I say vnto all, watch.
            
            Therefore beloued let vs all as one man buckle our selues to this weighty worke: and know that all men must die, and come to iudgement; and therefore happy is he that is best prepared for it, this is a more precious worke, then to purchase lands, or buy oxen, yea then to dine Christ himselfe, or flee to Tharsus, as Ionah from the face of the Lord. O Lord open we beseech thee, our drowsie eies, that we sleepe not in death, least the enemie say I haue preuailed against him; or where is now thy God: and thus farre as now of the necessity of this Text, and of watchfulnes.
            The next point is to seeke out the nature of this watchword, which I suppose The sense of this word watch. is more euidently apparant (as colours of contrarie die or hue) by the contrary sense or speech. Now the contrary tearme to watchfulnes is to be sleepy, carelesse or secure, how matters fare or

fall, well or ill. Therefore in saying watch, our Sauiour meaneth sleepe not, as we read in Mar. 13. 35. 36. Watch therefore, &c. least he find you sleeping. And in 1. Thess. 5. 6. Let vs not sleepe but watch and be sober. Now whereas there is a naturall sleepe, a deadly sleepe, or sleepe in death, and a spirituall sleepe, heere the spirituall sleepe is only ment, which is a kind of dulnes of spirit, a satiety and vnaptnes to any godly exercise, as drowned in prosperity, or carnall contents and besotted in sinne, whereby he looseth all feeling in heauenly things, as if he were in a naturall sleepe, or sicke of a lethargie, whereof men die sleeping, or without feeling, and this sleepe our Sauiour Christ Iesus impliedly vnder this word watch, as being the Antithesis therof, commandeth vs to a voyd as the sorest enemie to watchfulnes, whereof I raise this doctrine.
            
               If we intend to lead godly liues, and to prepare our selues for death, and for Christs 
               Doct. 3. against carnall security. 
               appearing in iudgement, we must not sleepe in sinne, nor fuffer our selues to be ouertaken with carnall security, or carelesse

satietie in heauenly things, the doctrine is proued out of the afore named testimonies in Mar. 13. 36. and 1. Thess. 5. 6. Proofes by Scripture. Where the Apostle teacheth that the Thessalonians were not now in darknes, that that day should come vpon them as a theefe, but were the children of light, and for that cause were not to sleepe, but to watch and be sober, this sobriety also What sobriety is. is a spirituall temperance and moderation in the vse of the things of this life, least we become fettered and drunken as it were with the allurements and delights thereof so Rom. 13. 11. He sheweth that howsoeuer formerly they slept in security and sinne, without remorse or regard, whether to please or displease the Lord, yet now being conuerted to Christ, and euery moment expecting both for death and his comming to iudgment, it was time to awake from this sleepe, to cast away all stupidity of minde, all security of life, all pampering of the flesh, and to awake to God, to put of the old man, and to put on Christ Iesus, the like places we haue in Ephes. 5. 14. out of Isai. 60. 1. Examples shewe what harme

security bringeth, as to the old world, Sodomits and men of Laish, Luke 17. 26. 28. Iudg. 18. 7. and Deut. 29. 19. 20. Psal. 10. 6. 12. & 36. 2. & 49. 7. &c.
            And as no disease is so desperate, or past recouery, as that which groweth vpon a man so extreamly, that he hath no sense or feeling thereof, or which ouerwhelmeth him, with a sweetnes delight or sleepines, as doe the Lethargie, consumptions, and strong poisons: so is there no sinne so pernitious, as that which pricketh not the conscience, as this sleepie security, and such as we take to be small or no sinnes, as sinnes of custome, gainfull sinnes, as vsury, cunnicatching, &c. sinnes of sport, negligences, sinnes of omission, and of ignorance, &c. or such as we feele a holines in the doing thereof, as in all sorts of idolatry, and superstitions worships, humaine inuentions in Gods seruice, as in praying, and praising God, in lip labour without feeling, or attention of heart, so charming sorcerie, coniuring, casting of figures, and iudicial astronomie, as also when we feele no guilt of sinne, by reason of

the hardnesse of our hearts, and corruption of our liues, as doe persumpters, adulterers, murtherers, theeues, swearers, &c. and yet take themselues to be cockesure, by reason that sometimes they goe to Church: mumble a few prayers by rote, and tale, or for that they pay their tythes, fast, &c. As he, Luk. 18. 11. and Isa. 65. 5. Or leade ciuill liues; Exhortation. yet let such awake speedily from this deadly sleepe; and know, that now Satan preuaileth and keepes the possession when all is peace, peace, and thou in the broad way to damnation; vnlesse in this quiet storme thou fall lustily to the tackling for thy shippe is in the quick sands, ready to drowne: fall therefore to speedy repentance; crie to the Lord mightily; thy ship sinketh, procure his fauour in Christ, shake of thy drowsinesse least as a sluggish souldiour thou loose the day, and Satan get the victory.

What thinke ye of these pillars of the Church, Peter, and Andrew, Iames and Iohn? were they not Christs chosen and best beloued Apostles, and most mortified men, who had forsaken all for Christ, and had of long time beene continually schooled by the Lord himselfe; so that Peter had good reason to doubt, that this commandement concerned them not, and yet see what sadde and serious exhortation our Sauiour giueth them, not to snort in security? The mercifull God be gracious and mercifull vnto vs. Is our corruption so contagious, so farre and wide crept, and euery where so pestilent,

that in all the world not on man nor woman can be found, who can say, I neede not watch. I may sleepe carelesse for thou Lord of thy goodnesse haste made my hill so strong, my lampe ouerrunneth 
               Psal. 30. 6.

Isa. 65. 5. No, no, neither Peter, nor Andrew, Iames nor Iohn, are exempted, I say to you, Take heede, watch and pray, and what I say to you, I say to all (none excepted) watch, sleepe not, and why? But for that securitie, carelesnesse, & sleepe, so inebriate mens minds, as a continuall drunkennesse, that they neither remember God to know his reuealed will, nor stir vp themselues to reforme their liues, nor yet arise from from this dead sleepe, that Christ may giue them life. And this deadnesse of heart, (that nothing can awake them, with what pipe soeuer ye play) what is it else, but as in Christs time it was an infallible signe of the destruction of the Citie and Temple, so now of the end of

the world, when Christ shall not finde (as himselfe foretelleth) faith vpon the earth. 
               Luk. 18. 8.
            
            2. This serues for comfort to Gods 
                  Vse 2. For comfort for such as watch. Elect, who in watching and prayer, wholly submit themselues to Gods commandement, doe most carefully, shake off this drowsie sluggishnesse, in the whole course of their liues: not forgetting they must die & be brought to iudgement; and albeit they sometimes cannot chuse but slumber & sleepe. Matth. 25. 5. Yet are they full secure and carelesse, there lampes purely burning, and well stored with oyle, for they replenished in hearts, with faith and obedience in life, haue euer a good conscience, are euer prouided and are sure that (there sinnes in Christ being pardoned) no euill can befall them; nor separate them from the loue of God. Rom. 8. 38, 39. But may euer with Dauid cheerefully sing, I will lay me downe and also sleepe in peace, for thou Lord only makest me dwell in safetie. Psal. 4. 8. And what (beloued) can be more ioyfull and comfortable to vs, then by these meanes now in this life, to be interressed to Gods heauenly

regalties, and diuine priuiledges, whereby this kingdome of grace, wherein we thus conuerse, is made an entry to the kingdome of glory, and not now only, but at our death will make vs sanctifiedly secure and ioyfull, when then a farre off (as saylers vpon the sea) wee behold our long wished hauen and home, and thereupon breaking vp our watch and ward, doe confidently in sure faith and vndoubted hope of a glorious resurrection to life eternall, commit our selues, soules and bodies into the hands of our gracious God, and thus farre of the Antithesis; next of the Thesis it selfe which is watch.
            This watchword I deuided into three 
                  Part. 1. Of watching in speciall. parts, for this life, for death, for iudgement. In the first place I am to shew how we are to watch for this present life, that so wee may liue according to Gods holy will, while wee haue our aboade heere, and be the while secured of Gods good acceptance of vs, and all our doings and dealings: wherefore of this first branch of watching I gather this doctrine: viz.
            
            
               
               Seeing the whole lifo of a Christian is a continuall warfare full of labour and dangers, 
               
                  Doct. 4. To watch for the leading of a godly life in this world. 
               and we enuironed on euery side with many and mightie, fierce and malitious enemies, we must while we liue in these earthy Taber nacles and tents (as souldtours in the field and pilgrimes in the world) in all carefulnesse, pietie, and sobrietie, constantly watch ouer euery periode of our liues and all our actions, that so wee may passe our daies religiously and holily according to Gods reuealed will during our naturall liues.
            This proposition is thus prooued. First Proofes by Scripture. our Sauiour here, and in sundry places besides, stirreth and commandeth his Disciples and vs all to watch: and in Luk. 12. 35. to 49. largely discourseth of this point, concluding againe and againe, That blessed is that seruant whom the Lord when he commeth shall finde waking. And Paul in 1. Cor. 15. 34. Exhorts vs to awake to liue righteously and not to sinne, and 16. 13. To watch, to stand fast in the faith, to quite vs like men and be strong, and Eph. 6. 18. To watch with all perseuerance and supplication for all Saints.
               
Where he makes watching a part of our Christian armour, against Satan and all his power, and so doth Peter, 1. Epist. 5. 8. And the Angel of the Church of Sardis exhorteth her to awake and watch, else threatneth to oome vpon her suddenly as a theefe, Reuel. 3. 2, 3. and in Reuel. 16. 15. Christ againe calleth them blessed who watch and keepe their garments least they walke naked and men see their filthtnesse, &c.
            
            Reasons enforce the doctrine: as first By reasons God commands vs to watch; which he would not, were it not behoouefull and needfull for vs. Secondly, the imminent dangers we stand in, perswade thereunto as the corruption of our nature: prone to sinne and to all mischiefe; Sathans manifold assaults and temptations; certaine vncertaine death; Gods wrath and vnsupportable iudgements; the baits and allurements of this life; as with so many cartropes pulling vs to sinne, and damnation, crosses, and death in euery creature we vse; and vnder euery stone lurketh a Scorpion ready to sting vs to death, if wee bee not vigilant

and constant in prayer.
            Thirdly, the benefites redounding to vs hereof, should set vs forward to this dutie, as namely: first, we shall liue righteously and glorifie God in all our dealings: 1. secondly, we shall be as in compleate 2. harnesse appointed, against Sathan, the world, sinne, and our owne concupiscences: thirdly, be helpfull to 3. men: fourthly, hurtfull to none: fifthly, Blessed of God in this life: sixthly, 4. most happie in the life to come, &c. 5. which the Lord of glory grant vs all to doe.
            The first vse we are to make of this 
                  Vse 1. Is to declare how weare to watch. sad doctrine serues to instruct vs, wherein we are not to watch, and wherein according to our Sauiours will we must watch; where we are to vnderstand that our Sauiours minde, is not in watching we should forbeare naturall sleep, which is as needfull and profitable for vs as is our food: vnlesse it be for some part of the night, that we awake to God, and in that silent and solitarie time giue our selues to prayer. So Dauid saith, he remembred God in his bedde and thought

vpon him when he was waking, Psal. 63. 1. 7. At midnight rose vp to giue God thankes. Psal. 119. 62. And euery night washed his bedde and watered his couch with teares. Psal. 6. 6. and good reason had he so to doe. For this was the most conuenient time to speake without interruption, and talke at large and most familiarly with his God, which worke in truth, was to be preferred before any sleepe, Then in the day time. He was so taken vp with the affaires of the kingdome, that he often had no time to call vpon God in priuate, and therefore would rise at midnight, to pray & praise the Lord. So our Sauiour, when for the presse of the people, and his indefatigable labour in preaching, and teaching the people, and working of miracles, he could not talke with his God in prayer, He would goe out to the mount to pray, and spend the whole night therein. Luk. 6. 12. and 21. 37. And so shou'd we doe, for the night is the fittest time for this holy worke, for then may wee haue elbow roome inough, without any disturbance of wife, children, family or

friends, nor yet of secular affaires, to examine our hearts, if Christ called vs at midnight to iudgement, or at cockecrowing, or in the dawning, Mark. 13. 35. we might euery way be ready prepared and waking, yea walking with our God; and also to powre out our hearts to our good and mercifull God in prayer, and be heard. And yet this is no warrant for swinish wretches, who if they pray at all, neuer pray but in their beds, and that so drunken, drowsiely, and sleepingly, that in the middest of their lip-labour deuotion they fall asleepe, and withall ioy and comfort themselues, yea bragge it out, that they euer fall asleepe in a good worke, that is, as if they said they were ouertaken with sleepe, in abusing Gods Maiestie with their lippe-labour prayer, taking his name in vaine, and offering vnto him the sacrifice of fooles, Eccle. 5. 17. and 6. 1. But by watching, When we are to watch. the Lord warneth vs to be vigilant and carefull ouer our whole liues and euery part thereof, that Satan with his subtilties and sleights, nor yet the world We must watch ouer our selues. with the enticements thereof, nor sinne

with his deceitfulnesse, nor our owne nature, with the lusts and corruptions therof, draw vs from our faith and profession, or from our loyall obedience to the Lord, and so defeate, vs of our ioyfull victory and hopefull triumph, in that great day ouer all gods and our enemies, and withall depriue vs of our vncorruptible crowne of glory: and for this cause must wee euer imitate the Hare, who though shee sleepeth, yet neuer closeth her eyes together, but euer pricketh vp her cares to listen, if any dog barke or trace after her: so though wee sleepe our hearts euer must bee awake, Cant. 5. 2. Iob 9. 28. and with Iob must feare and examine all our waies, and know that in this holy worke we haue no greater enemy then our selues, and therefore (as our houshold, and euer flattering foe) we must watch, and distrust all our actions, and as vnder an yron locke, keepe in, and vnder, all our thoughts, words and workes, else they will lay broad open the gates of our soules for Sathans complices to enter in and robbe vs of all graces temporall and spirituall, and

then woe, woe shall be vnto vs. Neither is this all our charge though this bee We must watch ouer

                  st ouer his wife. Husband ouer his wife, that as before she was married to him she was ospoused to a better husband, euen in Baptisme to Christ Iesus, and at his hand receiued her to be his helper, vpon condition, to see her keepe faith and truth to her first husband. So must he carefully watch ouer her that shee breake not faith nor promise in any case, but daily walke more and more worthy of the Lord in all sinceritie, good conscience, faith vnfained, and all loyall and renewed obedience: and seeing shee is the chiefest of her heauenly Fathers goods, be sure to respect and keepe her in all honestie, pietie, and honour, as the chiefest iewell of price committed to his safe custodie, and in due time be readie to restore her to God her Father, a pure and chast Matrone without spot or wrinckle. For hauing vndertaken a charge, hee must beautifie and adorne the same, and say of

her as Augustus of Rome, I found it of bricke, I leaue it of Marble, which he may well and easily performe, beeing first godly religious himselfe, and know that his wife is his sweete garden, wherein he must continually walke, and his most gainfull vineyard, wherein he is euer to be imployed, neither will any (I trow) bee so fond as to thinke to reape commoditie from his vineyard, if he plant not therein, continually the choisest vines, whatsoeuer they cost, which set will quite cost, and prune and dresse his trees, nor to take delight and comfort of his garden, if he be not carefull to weede it of all vnsauoury herbes, and set therein the most vertuous, and sweetest, plants as are to bee found, else madde were he that would exclaime that hee can make no commodity nor gather any fruit out of his garden or orchard, when as hee neuer set on good herbe nor plant in them one or other. The like is euery husband to deeme of his wife, watch for her good, and shee will doe thee all good.
            Then secondly, euery father is to 2. Ouer his children.
               
watch ouer his children, that they degenerate, and grow not from pure wheare to wilde oats, as Helies sonnes did, to the destruction of parents and children. 1. Sam. 4. 17. &c. And this watch is hardest of all, because they be the fruit of our bodies in which respect we are ouer indulgent, as was Dauid to Absolon. 2. Sam. 18. 3. and 19. 33. and to Adoniah. 1. King. 1. 6. And therefore are they too often more rebellious and head-strong, then wee can rule, or willingly would bend, much lesse breake or cast out of our houses, and stone to death. Deuter. 21. 18. And who though he were full of eyes and neuer sleeping, is sufficient for these things, and therefore parents with heauie hearts often sing Moses song, in Numb. 11. 11. &c. Lord if I haue found fauour in thy sight kill me, that I behold not my misery! What is heere then to be done? shall wee in the most needfull place giue ouer our watch? God forbid. But rather herein follow Salomons counsell in Prou. 22. 6. Traine vp (or Catechize) a childe (that is, while he is a childe) in the way he should goe; and

when he is old, he will not depart from it: And good reason, for looke how the first institution of children is, sutable thereunto will be their whole life, continually aspecting thereupon, as we see the Sunne euer setteth euen against the place it first that day arose. And looke what impression the waxe taketh when it is new, it will retaine when it is hard and old. Gods people were carefull hereof, for wee see how watchfull Iob was ouer his children, how he sent and sanctified them, and rose vp early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Iob thought, it may bee my sonnes haue sinned and blasphemed God in there hearts, thus did Iob euery day. Iob 1. 5.

            Neither doe I take it any sin besides holy writ, to shew vnto you how the holy ancient Christians, were not sleepy in this worke: as Leonides Origens father was so painfull in the education of Origen, that daily he exercised him inreading Example of Origent training vp of a childe. and learning by heart, set portions of the holy Scriptures, wherein the childe had such inward and mysticall speculation, that many times he would mooue very profound questions concerning the meaning of the Scriptures, that his father in outward shew, would reprooue him for wading so deepe into matters vncapable for his age, and often would vncouer his brest being asleepe and kisse it, giuing thankes to God that made him father of such a childe, and being but seuenteene yeeres of age, had such desire to suffer martyrdome for Christ with his father, that his mother priuily in the night hidde away his

clothes, that for shame he could not go forth, but writ to his father, to take heede for affection, to wife, or children to recant. Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 2. So in the time of the Tenth persecution of the Euseb. lib. 6. cap. 2. Primatiue Church, a little childe of feuenteene yeere old made a glorious confession of the vnitie of the Dietie and together with Noble Romanus suffered martyrdome Prudent. de cor. Martyr. And when Valeus the Arrian Emperour sent his deputie to slay all the Orthodoxe Christians congregated in a Church at Edesse in Mesopotamia, a poore woman of the citie hearing thereof, hastned with her children in her armes thither, which the Deputy seeing, asked her whether she would, she answered to the Church to suffer martyrdome, so godly giuen mother and children were in those daies Ruffinus, lib. 2. cap. 5.

And the king of Bulgaries sister conuerted that countrey, saith Zonaras: Athanasius but a child, would reason with his plar-fellowes of the mysteries of religion, Ruff. lib. 1. cap. 14. So the children of Samosata when Lucius an Arrian Bishop as they were at Ballplay had with his foote touched their ball, they would not play with it, vntill they had drawne it thorow the fire, Crying their Ball was defiled by the heretiques foote. Theodoret lib. 4. cap. 15. And no lesse worthy to bee remembred are the children of Merindoll in France who were so expert in the principles of religion that questioning one with another before the Bishop of Cauaillon with such grace and grauitie as was maruellous to heare, thereupon a religious man come lately out of Paris said to the Bishop: I must needs confesse that I haue often beene

at the common schooles of Sorbone in Paris where I haue hard the disputations of the diuines, but yet I neuer learned so much as I haue done by hearing these yong children, according to Matth. 11. 25. Act & Mon. pag. 868. Thus we see how Gods children watched ouer their babes from their infancie, and what good effects it brought forth in and by them and so would with vs, if we did the like, the Lord open our hearts, and make vs see how many millions of babes, and infants, come to fearefull designements, by reason of parents sleepinesse and securitie in this behalfe.

It is necessary for vs so to doe for all men know and confesse, that Sathan spits and beares, an implacable hatred to young Satans spite to little children. babes, and infants; because they be the seede of the Church, and therefore labours to draw and keepe them in all prophanenesse, as he caused the Iewes by an Apish imitation of Abrahams offering of Isaack to sacrifice their children to Moloch contrarily, Leuit. 18. 21. and 20. 2. So in Popery be Priests, Monkes, and Nunnes kept from lawfull marriage, beget children, and in the birth stifle them, witnesse Huldericke Bishop of Ausbrough who in an Epistle to Pope Nicholas the first, relateth how Pope Gregrorie the first, vpon a certaine day sent vnto his fish pond for fish, and aboue 6000 infants heads were brought vnto him which were taken out of that pond or moat whereupon he confessed his restraint of Priests marriage to be the cause thereof, and if this was in one pond, what was in euery place and at all

            3. Then in this progresse as wit and 3. discretion with plainnes of speech commeth, teach him by rote the Lords prayer, then the beleefe, after the Decalogue and so pithie questions, and answers concerning the principles of Religion, then some short graces, which he is before and after his meals to say, with

Church. Finally, God loueth vs, for after death he will raise vs to life, and we shall euer liue with him in heauen, and therefore must we loue and glorifie him in euery thing. Then teach him to feare and abhorre sin, in thought, word, and work. And first to know as much as conueniently may be by the ten commandements what sin is, and the temporall and spirituall penalties thereof. As thus also: wee must not sinne for then God will be angry with vs, then wil he take his grace and peace from vs, then will he send vs troubles, sicknesses, death, and cast ve to hell with the diuell and reprobates. And let him learne to doubt of his doing, and demand of his parents, if this should be done or vndone, if the Lord bid or forbid it, if he loue or hate it, and to conclude that if God will it: I will doe it, if not, to die rather then doe it.

Then with other parts thereof: and withall to make some vse thereof, as we must not breake Gods commandement, for this brought sinne and misery vpon the world, wee must nor mocke the ministers, for this caused God to send Beares to kill the children of Bethel, maids must not be gadding about, so Dinah was defloured, we must not breake the Sabbath, for he that gathered stickes that day was stoned to death, nor blaspheme the Lord for the blasphemer must die the death, nor with Absolon dishonor our parents, nor with Cain commit murther, &c. Only be carefull not to ouercharge him with too many things at once, nor yet to cloy or ouer weary him, for there is nothing more pernitious then sacietie in well doing, this will cause him forsake all: but let his labours be workes of libertie, freedome, and sport, knowing that the schoole-house is called not Carnificina a butcherie, but Ludus a sporting and playing place, where all things bee

taught and learned with ease and delight. Thus let him proceede till he be readie for some calling, but euermore the parents must be watchfull that he be not carried away with ill company, or infected with the sinnes of the time, place, or his age, but that euer he proceede according to these beginnings, and while the parents bee parents, let them watch and command ouer their children, and they euer obay, &c.

Gen 4. 9. But because it were an endlesse labour to speake of all sorts of people: and of all duties belonging to them, and to euery period of mens ages, where of their be already intire volumes extant: I will surcease and speake of on or two more and referre the rest to euery godly

euery brooke and riuer, Gen. 1. 20. and 48. 16. The fisher could hardly catch any: and so if the Lord wrought not miraculously by his word and spirit, with his painefull Minister, he should neuer catch on of them, so wilde, and vntractable they be: nay hee shall be so farre from catching them, (be he an vsurer, a Church robber, an oppressour, &c.) that vnlesse he well see to himselfe, the fish will catch the fisher, and make him more the childe of hell then themselues, and therefore no tongue is able to expresse his care, vigilancie, labour and trauell, neuer at rest, that whereas all others, worke the sixe weeke daies: yet they rest from their labours vpon the Lords day, but this poore shepheard, is to expect no rest, but as the Sunne running his course: laboureth all the weeke; but most of all vpon the Lords day, and what remedie, but that as Ierem 10. 19.

A lamentable case that couetousnesse and ambition, should so ouersway any bearing the name and nature of a man; much more of a Christian, that to puffe vp himselfe in pride and contempt of God and his ministery, and to prinke his wife and children in sinfull brauerie, riot, and excesse idlenesse and sensualitie, should make no conscience to bath himselfe, and his posteritie in the bloud of his brethren, yea the knowne price of Christs sacred bloud, and that in all Gen. 4. 10. 11. and 9. 5. 6. ages, and for euer too, we say (and see it

by daily experience) that bloud will haue bloud, and the Lord himselfe saith so to, in those that but kill mens bodies only, as we see in Ahab and Iesabell, in Naboths matter, but what shall become of such as kill men, women, and children, soules and bodies, and so farre forth as in them lieth, send them to hell fire. Dauid would not drinke of the water fetched from the well of Bethlem, because it was the bloud of three men that went in ieopardie of their liues for it, but they eate and drinke the bloud of infinite numbers, yet make no conscience nor scruple thereof. 2. Sam. 23. 15, 16, 17. The last of the tenne plagues of Aegypt which was the soarest of all the rest, was the killing of the first borne of man and beast, for then, Pharaoh rose vp in the night, he, and all his seruants, and all the Aegyptians and there was a great crie in Aegypt for there was not on house where there was not one dead: &c. Exod. 12. 29. to 34. but this is much more fearefull and lamentable, whereby these Church-champions staruing, persecuting and molesting, with an implacable secret hatred, the Lords

watchmen and stripping them of that God gaue them, not only one in euery house, but euery on in euery house, of euery Parish, they set foote in, is vnmercifully and cruelly slaine and that not only in bodies, but also (if Gods mercies preuent not, in soules too, Ioptah tooke this a strong plea against the king of Ammon, Iudg. 11. 24. that as he ought rightfully possesse that which Chemosh his God had giuen him to possesse; so Iphtah and Israel ought to possesse what the Lord their God gaue them, and by like consequent may wee so reason, looke what allowance the Lord gaue vs, and ours for euer, that ought we to enjoy, but hee gaue vs this holy tribute, and therefore ought we quietly enioy it, vnlesse by expresse word hee reuoke this donation, which he neuer did. But if you answer, that this is true if we could prooue that that donation in Numb. 18. 20. &c. Were perpetuall and neuer to be abrogated, then the tythes might stand euer iure diuine and no man take them away: without permission from God. I answer, all the learned preachers

            But if you obiect, that the tythes bee Obiect. leuiticall, and therefore since Christs resurrection abrogated; and in that respect the Ministers by diuine right cannot claime them. I first desire to learne, by what Scripture doe you warrant

this assertion is, that they be abrogated, but if you cannot, then by Ieroms rule Contra 
                     〈…〉
                  
                  liud. 
               what soeuer cannot be prooued by Scripture, it may with the like authoritie be denied as affirmed. But if you will haue them so to be, because you say so, therefore to grant it as vpon Pythagor as word; were to glory in men. And therefore I would be resolued, whether any part of the Leuiticall rites be abrogated, except only such as figured the spirituall fulfilling thereof; by Christ, or his Church; and which be they; but in my opinion tithes figure nothing in Christ to be fulfilled, in any of his two natures, or three offices: and therefore are not Leuiticall nor abrogated, but stand as sure as first they were enacted, vnlesse you say that as the tythes giuen Leuie, for seruing in the Tabernacle should stand firme vntill the Messias came, who would then himselfe discharge all Gods Ministry, and after neuer vse mans seruice therein: which we see is not so: Or else that in his daies and euer after, the Church should in it selfe be so throughly instructed, that it needed no Ministers, which

is not so neither, and therefore tythes be no figuratiue right, and if not, I demand, A dilemma. why should they bee abrogated vnlesse we arrogated to our selues, wisedome aboue the Lords, and could deuise a better way for the Ministers maintenance, then the Lord could. But admit the tythes bee Leuiticall as you would haue them, and that they figure some mysticall secret we be not worthy to know: then must you confesse (as you do) that they be abrogated, now Christ is come, and being fuifilled in him, are not to be exacted by any, nor to be payed by any Parishioner to any man, for this were to ioyne with the Iewes, that the Messias is not yet come, which is to deny the faith, and so Christ shall profit vs nothing at all, as Paul prooues of Circumcision, Gal. 5. 3. And if so, why should any Minister demand tythes, much lesse any secular man, or any Parishioner pay any, seeing this is to deny plainly, that Christ is come, but while we pay tythes, we looke for another, else by paying Leuiticall tythes, you hold all the rectors and parsons appropriate, and also all the

people in the land which pay or receiue tythes in a Iewish errour, and infidelity. And by the like right, may you compell the people to pay you, sheepe, and oxen, flowre pigeons, and what not: which in old time were brought to the temple for Sacrifices and offerings, which is most deuillish and absurd and this done, seeing the tythes be Leuiticall and abrogated, you must out of the spirituall truth, and meaning of the Leuiticall law in Numb. 18. 20. Draw out a spirituall true certaine law, for the Ministers portion for euer, in all places of the world, and that as all changes vnder the Gospell be 2. Cor. 3. 7. 8. Heb. 12. 22. and 10. 28. 29. farre more excellent then those vnder the law, so the Ministers maintenance gathered out of the spirituall sense of this ceremoniall law, must in all respects be farre better, richer, and plentifull, then the legall tythes and offerings were, which yet all the learned in the world haue not found, nor neuer shall, which plainly sheweth, that this law in Numb. 18. 20. Is an euident explanation of a principall branch, of the fourth and fifth lawes morall, and that the tythes

are and euer were, since the first establishing of the Church gouernment, due by diuine right, to the Ministers of Gods Church in all ages alike. And the like is to be said of all donaries, and Abbey lands due to the Ministers. gifts giuen in former time to God and his Church, that is for the maintenance of Gods holy and true seruice in his Church, (whether they were yeerely pensions of money, or lands, as the Abbey lands) to serue God in such places, as the Abbeyes were situate, which now ought not iure Diuino to bee alienated from Gods Ministers, and giuen or sold, to secular men, and that for these reasons.
            1. What was giuen to God and his Church, (that is to the Church men, Reasons Prouiding it. that serued God in the Church, yeerely and weekely) for euer, ought not without Gods expresse commandement be taken from them: and we see how Caluin in Hosean cap. 1. ver. 3. sharpely reprooueth King Henry for this fault. 2. Those lands were giuen for euer, for the seruice of God in those places only, where the Abbeis stood, and therefore, were

neuer to be alienated from them, that serued God in those parishes; how soeuer religion altered, from worse to better; but then to be the rather appropriated to the Ministers, then being from generation to generation, because the lands were giuen for the true and holy religion of God, but now the Ministers serue God in better measure, and manner, then did the Monkes, &c. And therefore ought they the rather, now possesse them all, and they not be taken away from them. This may bee confirmed by Dauids practise, who, when the Leuites were to cease to carrie the Arke, and Tabernacle, from place to place, for the on and other, were to be put in the Temple, which was shortly to be builded, Dauid, though the Leuites office ceased, took not away from them their lands, nor liuings, but disposed otherwise of the Leuites for the seruice of the Temple, 1. Chron. 23. to 27. And so should it be done heare.
            3. That which is once dedicated to holy vses, ought neuer to be conuerted to prophane exploits, how worthy or

vnworthy soeuer, but should continue to the seruice of God, whereto it was giuen for euer, and therefore the taking of the Abbey lands from the Ministers, was wrongfully done, as Leuit. 27. But if any will heare bee contentious; we haue no such custome, neither the Churches of God. 1. Cor. 11. 16. And for me, let euery vessell sit on his owne bottome.
            Yet (will you say) Our learned Ministers teach vs a contrarie doctrine to Obiect. this, else would we forsake this sinne, repent and make large restitution?
            
               Answ. And so had you neede indeede, and I would your learned men, that hold you in Sacriledge and vnbeleefe had more learning discretion, and better consciences, then to breake Gods commandements and teach men so to doe; and this we euer see, that all euill that Math. 5. 19 commeth to the Church, commeth euer from Church men, who with the ministers arrowes, pearce the Ministers hearts. For saith Cyprian, the diuell hath inuented a new deuise vnder the name of 
               De simplie. Plator. 
               learned and reformed Christians to deceiue the ignorant and simple, and what dealing

is this, shamelesly vpon opinion of Seraphicall excellencie, to violate Gods expresse lawes, and to detaine ignorant blind people, in their deepe Sacriledge, and to robbe the Ministers of their right and portions, and why, but because our reformed Ministers forsooth, sooth vs so, and therefore it is so, alas (poore good men) that pinne their soules & saluation, to other mens sleues and what is this, but to exalt men aboue Gods truth, and to glory in them and not in the Lord, and because ye loue your sinnes; vse all meanes to retaine them: but I wish your reformed Ministers were better informed, that so you by them might bee reformed, and not thus liue and die in your fearefull sins, but this truth, (to depart from your Sacriledge) is to tart, and ye therefore loue it not, and you know what Paul writes, in Thess. 2. 10, 11, 12. Because men receiue not the loue of the truth, that they might bee saued, therefore God shall send them strong delusions, that they should beleeue lies, that all they might be damned which beleeued not the truth but had pleasure

in vnrighteousnesse. Sorrie I am, that this should bee verified in you (in whome otherwise shine many good things) which was spoken of Micha, who hiting a Leuite to be his priest, said, Now I know the Lord will be good vnto me, seeing I haue a Leuite to my Prophet, Iudges 17. 7. 13. But he (good man) was fowly deceiued, for albeit he exercised a superstitious worship, knowing no better being ignorant of the truth, yet he after his manner was well affected, desired the best things, and regarded not what he bestowed vpon a priest, so that hee might bee trained in the true worship and right seruice of God, and finding this Leuite, He thought to finde plaine dealing and to be throughly trained in pietie. But the Leuite seeking his owne, and not Michas good, (as is apparent in Iudg. 18. 20. Who for better preferment theeuishly forsaketh him, and did leaue him to liue and die for him in (his sins) treacherously deceiued him; whereof the Prouerbe arose, Good Micha met A prouerbe. with a bad Leuite, and so lost labor and cost. But if Micha had taken a right

course, and entertained a faithful Leuite, I meane a rough-tell troth, and a downe right reformer of his corruptions) who had withal taught him the truth of God sincerely, then might he iustly and vpon good ground, perswaded himselfe that his hart being vpright, & his life blamelesse, it should haue gone well with him. And so might you, who bragge of your great rabbynesse, and build the houses of your faith vpon their words, saying to you, what we say is holy, your case differeth not much from Michaes, for men (as that Leuite) be wittie; to prouide for themselues, and foresee that to please in ticklish causes & matters of conscience, is their best way (which policy whē

which will not soone, nor willingly be forsaken, they shall rot in them ere they wil awake them, or fal out with them on Gods behalfe, or for their saluation, which causeth our chiefest professours who abound in learning, and knowledge, yet still retaine their pride, ambition, couetousnesse, excesse, and their old sinnes vnreformed, to be ill spoken of, and their religion and profession not regarded, and how can they: when their Leuites reproue them not, but by silence and consent, and further encouragements (as in this matter of sacriledge) giue them wished allowance and backe them therein, and doe they not well deserue their hire? But beloued in the Lord, what dealing is this, to straine gnats, and to swallow camels: to bee precise in toyes, but to winke at horrible impieties, to stumble at strawes, and leape ouer blockes, truly saith Mr. Perkins on Matth. 5. 43. This is an infallible 
               A subtill and false teacher. 
               note of a false teacher to temper so the word of God to mens affections, and so to expound it, as both the truth of the doctrine and an euill vnreformed life may stand together
               
and thus for Michaes meting with bad Leuites, so if the Lord in time conuert them not, many fall to destruction, but if the Leuite (watch not ouer vs, let vs all watch in euery point, we know) to doe his will and the Lord will watch, to doe vs good in this life, and better in the life to come.
            Well I see (will you say) this is an hainous sinne, but to make restitution, would vndoe me and mine. I know God is mercifull, I will with Naaman in this on thing pray God to be mercifull vnto me, I will not restore it, let the Ministers liue or starue, if God forgiue me, I regard them not: I answer, this is to be like the souldiers, that came to a Church and hearing the people, pray for peace, said, phy pray not for peace, how shall we then liue. So you must liue, though (as they) vpon the spilling of your brethrens bloud, yet to cure this frensie, I will Minister you a better salue for this soare, for prayers are to no effect, while your hands are full of bloud, Isa. 1. 10. to 21. and 66. 3. Ier. 7. 9. Amos 5. 21. to 25. And it is a booke case, first, satisfie the plantife,

then agree with the King, first put away Achans theft, and then the King of heauen will be appeased, else fasting and prayer is to no purpose, Isa. 58. 3. 6. Zach. 7. 9, 10. and 8. 16. Mich. 6. 6. &c. Consider all these quoted Scriptures and deceiue not your selues. Only bee not like that young Gentleman, who Men wil be demned rather then forsake any one sweete sinne. would know what good worke to doe to obtaine eternall life, and when he was told that he wanted but on thing, hee would not doe it, he stood with and against Christ euen for on thing, & so lost heauen and all. Mark. 10. 21. And so we see most men haue on sweete sinne, as sacriledge, oppression, whooredome, drunkennesse, or the like, and in other things are vnreprooueable, for this on sinne, they will with your Siran, 2. King. 5. Pray Gods mercie, else to be damned they will not forsake it; as Cain for his hatred to his brother Herod for his brothers wise Elie for correcting his children, &c. And deserued they not worthily to be damned? who when Christ did all things for them, to the spilling of his heart bloud; will stand with him for on

thing, a worldly, a transitorie, a sinne, a shame, a damnable and a cursed thing, in the iudgement of God, man and Angels. But to the question: first I must say with Salomon, It is a snare or a destruction for a man to deuoure holy things, and after the vowes to enquire, Prou. 20. 25. That is very fearefull, it is for men to make againe and game, or sport of robbing the Church, vexing and abusing the Ministers ouer-mastering them, with all reuilings and indignities, as if they were the greatest theeues, and robbers liuing, vnworthie to breath vpon earth, and after to enquire if it be impietie, or how for this transgression to breake the snare of Gods eternall curse, and torments in hell: truly the snare is soone broken by restitution, Numb. 5. 7.

               Obiect. &c. Oh will the Church-robber say: Wee will repent and will not that serue, God requires no more of any, and are we alone debarred from the generall conditions of all the world? Answ. No God forbid, and farre be it from me to encrease any mans sinne, more then the Lord doth, or to cast vnnecessarie and false scruples into any mans conscience, but this I say, none can repent without faith, & where faith is, their must needs be new obedience, if then there be no amendment of life, and detesting of the sinne, it cannot be called true, but counterfeit repentance. For who can say that a fornicatour, abhors whooredome, so long as the harlot lieth in his bosome Isai, willeth the transgressour wash his hands from bloud and then come and not before and talke with God, Isa. 1. 16. to 19. and so is it in this case, and this is euident in, Mich. 6. 10. Where hee

shewes a reason that hee cannot but smite them, saying, Are yet the treasures of wickednesse in the house of the wicked, &c. For as the taking of the tythes doth begin, so the detaining of them continue the sinne, and so long as they continue with thee thy sinne is vnpardoned. Most woefull and lamentable it is to see, what a world of iniquitie the subtiltie of the serpent hath breathed, and suggested, to intangle and snare poore soules at vnawares: wee make Queries: and put cases, and beate our braines to deceiue our selues against the day of the Lord: were it not faire easier (omitting this patching) at once and for altogether to forsake sinne, and to discharge our soules, and without all Queries or doubts, to be sure of Gods blessing in this life, and saluation in the life to come, and not to sell our soules to Sathan, for the loane of stollen goods for a moment, and seeing there is but on thing that hindreth thee from thy God; why wilt thou comming so nigh the land of the liuing, as foolish Hobab 
               Leuit. 10. for on sinne, renounce thy God, forfeit

thy selfe, and thy family to perdition: which God forbid; on sinne made the Angels diuels, on sinne expelled our progenitors from paradise, on sin kept Moses, and on sinne kept all Israel aboue 20. yeere old from possessing the holy land: two only excepted, and will God aboue these dispence with your one sin of sinnes, more hainous in humane iudgement, then any of the former, and which is more, for the losse of this one capitall sinne, you shall finde treasures in heauen. Oh stand not, nor sticke for one sinne, what greater infidelitie then to distrust our God, willing vs to prooue him, if he bring our tyth to his storehouse, if he will not open the windowes of heauen vnto vs, and powre a blessing without measure?

and that litle thou now hast remaining, more then all thy former vnlawfull and vngodly tythes, prooue him if he will not send a learned Minister to all parishes in the land, men able and willing to stand in the gappe betweene vs and Gods wrath, and prooue him if with a crowne of glory he will not honour them that honour

As thus: first, consider that thou and thy predecessours haue gotten your money, you laid out to buy these Abbeyes, and appropriations, with encrease ten times or twentie times more. 2. Consider the iniurie and harmes you did to the Ministers and people, defrauding the on of his bodily allowance, and

comfortable fruits of his calling and labours, and the other of the foode of their soules, for both which thou must answer, if amends preuent not in faith and new obedience. 3. Desire God to incline thy heart to his testimonies and not to couetousnesse and to worke in thee a detestation of the price of bloud. 4. Confesse thy sinnes to God, and vse all meanes to be reconciled to the Minister and true owner of thy wealth, and as oft as thou canst and neede requires, let him gather the crummes of his owne liuing (which otherwise thou giuest to dogges and hogges vnder thy table,) euer comforting him and renuing thy heauy case thus encroaching vpon Gods Church and tribute. 5. Lay vp and purchase of the ouerplus a farme else where, and giue to God what is Gods. 6. Or if that will not be, become a tenant to God and his Church, and yearely pay the Minister so much as thou reapest aboue thy paines and charges in gathering the fruits. And faile not to binde thy posteritie in all ages, to pay the Church this yeerely anuitie

and holy tribute, but if thou doe neither, be assured thou shalt not long prosper, for this is a crying sin against thee and thine. And I doubt not but the Lord beholding the affliction of his Ministers, the crueltie and vnmercifulnesse of these transgressors, and the famine and oppression of the poore blind and

               ame of this land, will in time stirre vp the heart of some Noble Nehemiah, or godly Ebed-Melech, to speake to our most gracious Soueraigne for redresse of this Maladie: and so farre of this vse and remedie.
            Hauing proceeded thus farre in the Sect. 12. first member of watchfulnesse, for this life present, which in deede is most difficult and of largest scope, and without which the other two are to small purpose, and seeing that this weighty work concerneth all men, all women, all ages, all functions, and all dealings in the world, yea in euery thought, word, and worke, we must carefully watch, for vnder euery stone lyeth a scorpion ready to sting vs to death; and yet to enter to euery of these particulars were infinite,

I therefore for better discharging of the whole thought to annexe a few helpes Helpe to watch. to further you the more cheerefully to vndertake this watch with vndoubred assurance (the Lord assisting) to effect it to Gods glory & your comfort. Whereof the 
                  〈◊〉
                helpe to watch in all our affaires, The first helpe to walke in a generall calling. is for euery man to betake himselfe to a calling, which will keepe him from idlenesse; and many sinnes, this calling is two-fold, generall and speciall: first, the generall calling of a Christian is (by all godly meanes ordained by God) to endeauour to become truly religious, according to the Lords gracious couenant, made and sealed at our Baptisme; the reasons why wee must make this our calling and daily exercise; is first, for that we are full of impietie, Reasons. 1. originall and actuall; and so liable to eternall damnation by due desert, vnlesse we labour to abolish it and become godly: and the nature and powerfull working of Gods religion is such, that as a precious oyntment, it perfumeth, sweetneth, & sanctifieth, with the graces of Gods Spirit, the whole man

otherwise, is no better then an vnsauory carrion in the nostrils of the Almighty. 2. Then the doctrine of eternall life is so heauenly profound and ample, that we cannot in any sufficient measure, be furnished therewith, vnlesse we make a continuall labour and practise thereof, so throughly are we inuenomed by the stingings of the old serpent, and ouercouered with the leprosie of sinne, that we are wholly vnnaturalized, and vnapt for any, good thing, vnlesse we betimes enter into this holy trade of life, this is our plough wherewith we must manure the Church, gleebe of our hearts, else it ouergrowes with bryers and weeds, this is our paradise wherein we must euer be occupied in dressing it, else it will become a desart full of Serpents, heare must wee euer be learning else wee forget, euer watching else our enemy preuaileth, no sleeping in sinne, then the enuious man soweth tares among our wheat, no truce with Satan, for then

in a speciall calling, and honest trade of life, whereby he may get a sufficient maintenance both for himselfe, his family, and the Church and poore, to Gods glory and good of his Church, and this is Gods ordinance. Gen. 3. 19. that all creatures should be of some speciall calling, but man aboue all the rest, else that he should not eate, 2. Thess. 3. 6. to 13. And the law of equitie requires it, that as wee enioy the fruits of other mens callings, they should likewise of ours, and so increase vnitie and amitie as bretheren, and this is our paradise wherein we should euer be occupied, else we walke not in the way of all creatures, Satan excepted, who is of no calling, yet neither idle nor well occupied, we walke inordinately, busie-bodies, troublers of such as walk in the callings, open to all temptations and vanities, and yet therein so conceited and wiser then seuen that can render a reason, Prou. 26. 16. And such as at no hand can keepe true watch, but euer disturbing and persecuting the watchmen of their soules, excluded from the protection of Gods

Angels; a gracelesse generation, and if you obserue what heauie iudgements befall the wicked, you shall finde that they are cast vpon them by the hand of God, when they ranged out of their callings as to Sampson by Dalila, to Dauid in the matter of Vriah, to I

            But because worldlings would cast of their generall vocation to embrace this speciall only: and idlers would not labour but pretend walking in their generall calling, both complaine they cannot discharge both vocations in on day, and therefore take it sufficient to serue God on the Lords day, and themselues all the weeke daies.

                  y for Christian watchfulnesse, In both callings. order both callings together, and what is spoken of on daies worke may bee meant and applied to euery day. First, then so soone as thou awakest out of thy sleepe, stand vpon thy watch, and awake

to God, for the tempter with his vncleane suggestions, is at hand (and know that if our first thoughts be holy after our sleepe, we be such, if vnpure, we be wicked) then offer to God the sacrifice of prayer for thy sleepe, and life, and thine, that so the Lord being first in account with thee, may graciously hold with thee all the whole day. 2. 2. Then thinke of all thy sinnes thou canst call to minde, and the punishments due to them, temporall, as eternall, pray for pardon for them and be thankefull for thy happy deliuerance from them, by Gods mercies, Christs merits and working of Gods Spirit in thee, which thou shalt the readier performe, if thou think of thy death of Gods iudgement day, of the paines of hell and ioyes of heauen of the vanities and afflictions of this life, as of the momentanie pleasures thereof and how blessed are such, as furthest estranse themselues from them, and draw nightest to God in all Christian obedience. 3. This done, thinke vpon the discharging of thy speciall calling 3. this day, to Gods glory, thy soules

health, and good of all men, and the furthering of thy peace at thy death, and of thy reckoning in the day of iudgement. These meditations will first keepe thy 1. minde from bad thoughts, and Satanicall temptations: secondly, will sanctifie thy 2. soule: thirdly, will be forcible 3. motiues to prayers, and thankes giuing, and fourthly, will cause the Lord draw 4. neere thee, and blesse thee and all thou doest this day. Fourthly, rising pray 4. alone priuatly, and then publikely with thy family, and reade in their hearing some portion of holy writ, as a matter to meditate vpon all the day, which done betake thy selfe in the name of God, to thy speciall calling, and if thou thinke that these circumstances will take away a great part of thy daies worke, then rise the earlier, and continue the longer, and so haue the godly in all ages done and doe, and heare watchfulnesse sheweth it selfe to be a principall part, to bee performed of euery Christian. 5. Entering vpon thy worke, 5. be careful to carrie a simple godly heart in all thou takest in hand, for if Satan

steppe in, by any corruption to defile thy heart, all the thoughtfull streames that from this spring flow will bee vncleane, and therefore whatsoeuer thy calling is, set thy selfe euer in the presence of God, euer fearing to omit any godly dutie, or commit any the least thing displeasing his Maiestie but euer let the Lord be thy feare. 6. Then in doing 6. thy work, beware thou so mind thy priuate gaine, that thou coole not any grace in thee, or quench the Spirit, but do diligently, and painefully thy earthy businesse, with an heauenly minde, thy heart in thy worke euer inditing a good matter, and thy tongue vttering the same to them that are about thee. Seuenthly, doe thy worke skilfully least it 7. turne to thy reproch, doe it faithfully, not depending vpon the meanes, but vpon Gods blessing, doe it constantly, not starting from it, and doe it cheerefully, vsing in euery thing a good conscience, as if you were to die before night, and discharge those duties daily which thou wouldst wish thou hadst done, if now you were a dying.
            
               
Eightly, liue vpon thy trade and not cunning fetches, Prou. 27. 23. Let thy expenses bee no more then thy comming in, yet sticke not to spend where God and charitie requireth, and what remaineth, lay vp for supply hereafter as occasions shall require. At meales looke vp to God, and being as carefull to feede thy soule as bodie, reade some part of Scripture, performing some dutie of prayer before, and singing some short Psalme after, not forgetting to turne thy fragments into thy Almes basket, thou must not forget to catechize thy family vpon saturday, and prepare them for the Sabbath, and after the exercises in the Church vpon the Sabbath examine what they learned that day, and then repeate the Sermons out of thy penned notes vnto them, and thou and they practise them all the weeke following in this worke be discreete, kinde and mercifull to thy family, tyre not, nor chide them. 2. Doe all in season. 3. Be not tedious. 4. Praise and reward them. 5. Keepe constantly this order. As thou didst begin the day

religiously so end it deuoutly, & grieue not as men climbing a steepe hill you looke backward, so take a carefull view of thy actions all the day, consider what thou didst well, and wherein thou fa

               ull penitent for the other, and let not thine eyes sleepe, vntill thou bee perswaded of the forgiuenesse of that, and all other thy sinne, and looke with what deuotiō thou began the day, with the same or the like end the same, and as prayer was the beginning to open the morning, so let it be the barre to shut the euening, and thus watching ouer both callings, thou canst not in thy worldly affaires sleepe nor doe amisse. Heareunto may be added a third helpe, that whereas Satan (a vigilant Bishop in his owne circuit as Latimer calieth him) watcheth to doe vs all harme, as a roaring lyon haunting after his pray, we must to withstand his assaults bee sober and watch, 1. Pet. 5. 8, And saith Paul, put on the whole armour of God. Ephes 6. 10. to 1. Thess. 5. 6. to 12. For it is no good fighting with Sathan with his owne

weapons he is a sophister, dispute not with him in his owne Logicke, he is an Oratour, beware of his eloquence, he is a prince, take heede of his power, but as Satan in his owne cause must vse his owne strength, so we in our cause are to vse the Lords strength: and therefore the third helpe is, to put on the whole armour of God. that we may be able to stand against his assaults: for we wrastle not against flesh and bloud, but against principalities, &c. In vaine therefore it is for vs to goe about to defend our selues with holy water, crucifixes, or reliques of Saints or sword, and speare, for as that Leuiathan, Iob 41. 17.

                the enemy will strike that part of the body that is naked, and what booteth it to leaue on sinne and lie open in many, 2. It must be Gods armour of his owne making and bestowing, for in temptations no learning but Gods, no wisedome, but heauenly can helpe vs, the Lord knoweth the force of Satans

darts, his treacherous ambushments and peircing bullets, and therefore made this armour of huge proofe, and able to repell all the battery of Sathans suggestions: whereby we must learne, not to esteeme our spirituall fight as a May-game, but as a time of trouble and aduersitie, wherein we are assaulted by mighty enemies, and oftentimes foyled and wounded, and therefore must bee valiant, and not snort in carnall securitie, that so we may obtaine the victory and triumph. 3. This armour must be put on, else what auaile the meanes of 3. saluation, if we vse nor practise them. 4. We must not be dismated stand to it, 4. that is as in the campe euery man hath his place appointed him, and his proper colours vnder which he is to keepe him: so all Christian souldiours haue their stations, that is, their two vocations (as is aboue shewed) whereunto they are called of God within the limits wherof they are to containe themselues, and not thrust themselues into temptations, and leaue their standing, and if we be assaulted not flee away but stand

to it, for no armour is prepared for the backe, or fligh, for that is to Apostate, neither is there heare any mention made of putting of our armour, for Sathan is neuer at truce with vs, nor wee with him. 5. He sheweth what graces 5. necessarie for a Christian, whereof one is the girdle of veritie. For souldiours in 1. old time had a broad studded beetle, where with the ioynts of the brest-plate and that armour which defended the belly, loynes and thighes, were couered, so should we haue vprightnesse and sinceritie of heart, the band of all vertues, in the profession of the true religion of our Lord God. The second is, the brest-plate 
               2. 
               of righteousnesse, whereby is meant a good conscience, true sanctification, and a godly life; this Iudas wanted, and therefore Sathan entered into his open naked heart: Thirdly, Our feete must 
               3. 
               be shodde with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; where he alludeth, to the custome of souldiours in former times, who going into the fields strongly armed their legges and feete, with legge harnesse; wargraues or buskins, to prepreserue

them from the iniurie of the weather, the peircing of bryars, thornes, and such other things, as might hurt them, in the way as they marched, and from the violence also of their enemies blowes, when they were incountered; for al which vses, the Gospel serueth, in our spirituall warfare; for they who are armed with the true knowledge thereof, and are assured of the mercifull promises therein contained, may safely walke, in the waies of godlinesse, though they be full of the briars & thornes of afflictions, and persecution. For being prepared for this profession, no thornes of aduersitie, can flight or h

               eete of their affections shod with the zeale of Gods glory. Fourthly, The shield of faith, that 4. as souldiours haue their shields, to couer and defend their bodies, from the 1. Pet. 5. 9. stroakes of the enemie, so must a Christian, haue faith in Christ, 1. Pet. 5. 9. As Dauid fighting against Goliah, and this is an armour of proofe, to defend vs, against 1. Sam. 17. 36. 45. 
               Satans fierie darts, whereby the Apostle alludeth to the custome of souldiours

in ancient time, who malitiously poisoned their darts, whereby the bodies of those who were wounded therewith, were so inflamed that they could hardly be cured, or eased of their raging and burning paine, and such darts are all Satans temptations, wherewith he woundeth vs, if they bee not repelled and quenched with the shield of faith, they will inflame our lusts to sinne, and on sinne will inflame our hearts to another, till their bee kindled in vs a world of iniquitie, as in Dauid, Iudas, &c. 1. Sam. 11. 5, 6. So that if we 
                  〈…〉
               ll admit one of his fierie darts, they will inflame vs to receiue another, and so our burning wounds, will torment our consciences, & most hardly admit any cure. The fifth peece of our Christian armour, is the helmet of 
               5. 
               Saluation, which in 1. Thess. 5. 8. Is called, the hope of Saluation, and Rom. 8. 24. We are saued by hope, for as souldiours, when they goe to the field, put on their Helmets, to defend their heads from their enemies blowes, so we fighting this spirituall battle, must to keepe vs from desperation, put on hope of victorie, and

the crowne of saluation. The sixt, is, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word 
               6. 
               of God, This is defensiue, and offensiue, fit to defend ourselues, and offend, repell and foile the enemie, for as a souldiour, will not goe to the field without his sword, both to defend himselfe, and foile his enemy, no more must we hope, to defend vs from Sathan, nor to chase him without Gods word, we must fight and fence as did our Sauiour, in Matth. 4. 4. 7. 10. Else we fight blundly or with our fists, as they in 1. Sam. 13. 19. and 17. 39. The seuenth, is prayer so souldiours 7. euer pray, and heareby, obtaine wee strength to fight, and victory ouer our enemies; Matth. 6. 13. Luke 22. 40. 46. (and in Exod. 17. 11, 12. Sword & prayer beioyned together.) The eight, is watchfulnesse, as souldiours doe in the field, 8. who by night, as by day, are in danger, at vnawares to be assaulted by the enemies, and seeing, Satan knowing his time to be but short, redoubleth his forces and watchfulnesse to destroy vs, wee must semblably, redouble our care and watchfulnesse in seeking to preuent his

force, malice, and subtiltie. Heare wee haue, the Panoply of a Christian, who thus armed, with constant, sincere, and vpright faithfulnesse of heart, in his generall and speciall calling, leading an innocent godly life, keeping in all things, a good conscience, not fearing to professe, and preach Christ, yea to die for the truth of his Gospel of peace, Rom. 10. 15. continuing zealous for his glory, hauing faith in Christ, with assured hope of saluation, carefully, and wisely vsing the word of God, to defend himselfe, and repell Satans temptations, praying to God, with watchfulnesse and perseuerance, cannot faile, but winne the prize from Satan, not that we trust, so much in the armour, and meanes, as in God himself, who blesseth the means. The fourth helpe. To make mutuall coniuncton betweene pastour and flocke.
            
            The fourth helpe, for Christian watchfulnesse, is in all matters, great or small, (if they be of any importance, or concerne saluation, or damnation) to vse the aide, direction, and counsell of the watchman of our soules, and to suffer, no shadow of dislike, to weaken, much lesse breake, the mutuall coniunction

betweene vs and our Pastour: which point, though it be not regarded, but of few, (for what faithfull Minister, is almost any where reuerenced, and respected, of his owne flocke; yet it is more important, then many be aware off: for if you will obserue, the reason, why men be so sleepie in their Christian watchfulnesse, and why Sathan, so foulely and fearefully, deuoureth millions, who neuer thought of any such mattor, you shall finde the principall (if not the only) cause to be this; that they loue, nor fancie, nay hate the watch-man of their soules, and affect better, by many degrees, strangers then them, and so straying from their owne fold, are to often in the ruffe of their spirituall pride, caught in the briers, and deuoured of the roaring lyon, by pastour (that you bee not deceiued) I meane, their learned and painfull preacher, and not any dumbe watchmen which I reprooued aboue) though they can alledge, many reasons, for their vagaring, for 
                  〈◊〉
                the sluggard, is wiser in his own conceit, than seauen men that can render a

reason: Prou. 26. 16. This I take to bee Satans subtiltie that preaching shall do the people no good. a secret subtilty, and an exceeding deepe fetch of Satan, who as euer hee laboureth, to sowe tares in Christs wheate field, Matth. 13. 25. And to transforme himselfe into an Angel of light, 2. Cor. 11. 14. And when he doth most mischiefe (as in tempting Euah) will not be seene to haue any hand in the worke, Gen. 3. 1. So heare most s
                  •
               ily and wylely he powreth out, all his poison, to inuenome, and destroy (if possibly it might be) the whole body of Christs Church, and that vnder a visour of pietie, and the holy communion of Saints, and who would thinke it? For, hee seeing the people cannot be reconciled to God, but by the preaching of the word, 1. Cor. 1. 21. and 2. Cor. 5. 20. Which is the power of God, to saluation, to euery one that beleeueth, Rom. 1. 16. And beholding, how the Lord, daily thrusteth labourers to his haruest, whereby Satans forces, are much weakned, and kingdome ruinated, yet, he being in this case, vnable to stop the Preachers mouthes, or peoples eares, deuiseth to weaken the power of the word,

in pastour, and people, first by traducing the Ministers good name, and labours, then by deceiuing him, of some parts of his maintenance, or troubling him in law, &c. Which sinnes as they be practised but in few places, and by the worst sort of the people; and therefore the maladie cannot bee vniuersall, but is soone extinguished, but rather by infusing (I wot not how, but to our sorrow we feele it) a generall dislike, and cause lesse suspition, and distrustfulnesse betweene pastour, and flocke, and so by degrees dissolueth all holy fellowship and coniunction, betweene Minister and people, for on the one part, the godly painefull Preacher, seeing the stubbornnesse, and waywardnesse of his charge oppugning his instructions, and admonition; and (as it were of purpose, to despite him) to set vp disorders, and for all his labours, for their reformation, to follow their owne waies, hereupon he perswades himselfe, the people loue not, nor regard him, nor his teaching, nor yet any paines he takes with them, further then stands with their

lawlesse lusts, howsoeuer formally, they giue him, ciuill salutations, & plausible termes of curtesie, yet in secret, they traduce, and censure him, and his doctrine, whereupon being discouraged, and cast down, as taking his seede sowne vpon stony ground, he hath no heart, to recall them from their sinnes, but finding familiaritie to breede contempt, and truth hatred, he weepeth in secret, wisheth he had neuer come among them, but either fled with Ionah to Tharsis or Ionah 1. Ier. 9. 1. had with Ieremie some secret cottage, to finish his daies in, and neuer to preach to them in the name of the Lord. And so eating vp his heart with sorrow, estrangeth himselfe from them, giueth ouer his watch, taketh his best course, to bee to liue to God and himselfe, and as for his charge, to deale with them, a far off, in generall points, and as it were at the staues end, as they can, and will abide handling, being a contentious and vnthankfull people,) and so, if they peerish, they peerish; the fault is theirs, and it is long of themselues: and thus the power, soule, and strength of his ministery

is quite brooken, and lyeth without life in the dust. And because hee would doe some good, and get some comfort, of his ministery hee busieth himselfe in other mens charges, and so stealeth the hearts of the people, (Absolon-like) 2. Sam. 15. 6. from the lawfull Pastour, to himselfe; with thankes, and amends, (to say no more.) His people, on the other side, not abiding any admonition, much lesse reproose, at a Ministers hand, contemned, distrust, and suspect both his doctrine and dealings (being men of malitious and base minds) deeming, he doth all in subtiltie, and of hatred, to rule them, and set vp new orders, and so abridge them of the old customes; and albeit, hee otherwise be an honest man innough, yet is he to holy for them, for by his too often preaching, they finde him already an enemie to their peace, good neighbourhood, pleasures, and profites, and euer and anone in his doctrine, girding some, riding and deriding others, 
                  •
               awning vpon his sect, and fauorites, disquieting poore honest men, and therefore is not for

them, they would giue the best sheepe they haue, to bee ridde of him, if not, they will be to hard for him, doe what he can, &c. Thus they cease not all, to grow on an head against him (as sheepe when on runnes to the water, all the rest will) to censure, carpe, and scanne all his words, trace his steps, prie into his priuate and publike carriage, wrest all to the worst, and in what they can, meete him at euery stile, and though his learning be good, yet they would, hee would follow it himselfe, and hope to finde on day to be fully reuenged vpon him, for his wrongs to them, honest quiet men, and if there be any wicked Gentleman in the Parish, to him will they flocke, to open their griefes and craue helpe, and counsell to driue away their Parson, who in adiuellish hatred, to all Ministers, and secret emulation, (taking all honour, and reuerence giuen the Minister) to be taken from him, and that (if he be patrone) thinking if he could firret him out, to get all to himselfe, and put in a dumbe dogge, for seuen pound a yeere stipend, to murther

the Parish, and teach his children too, and what cares he, He can make friends, toward all blowes, thereupon (in colour to gratifie the people) he will play Achitophel, and plod all he can against him, be it true or false, all is on, and these pernitious sots will sweare to any thing, so that he tell them what it is (for memory sake) that they must sweare vnto: and so will he not cease, first secretly, then impudently with open forces, to assault the tyred Minister, either to expell him, or to bring him vnder his ferula, to speake nor doe no more, then will stand with his worships pleasure, (forsooth,) or if he cannot bring him to this slauery, yet, (to keepe him in continuall trouble, sorrow, and vexation of spirit) will set the whole Parish against him, will fauour, and applaud euery on that speaketh or doth any thing against him, will ioy, and solace himselfe, when any gybe, iest, mocke, flout, slander, or abuse the Minister any way, and be a bitter enemie to euery on, that liketh of or speaketh well of their Preacher, and so will not spare, to turne the hearts of the

people, wholly from him, that his Ministery shall neuer doe them good, whiles he liueth; which is all the diuell himselfe would haue them doe, and is so true, that it cannot be denied at all neither doe I speake all I know herein; the Lord giue them repentance speedily, for otherwise, the bloud of all their Parishes, & the Ministers bloud also whom they thirst after, will bee required full dearely at their hands, yet they this while, are iolly and iocund, and thinke, they doe God good seruice, in persecuting, Ioh. 16. 2. and murthering his Saints, and are sorrie, they cannot finde some hainous accusations against them, to dispatch them out of this life, which is plaine wilfull murther in heart, whereas they ought to doe them all good, deliuer their own soules from death, and bloud guiltinesse, and vse all meanes to bring the people, whose goods in great measure they possesse, and whose bodies doe them all seruice they can, to the knowledge and obedience of God, being themselues formost in the worke, and not thus shew themselues religious

in nothing, but in persecuting the Ministers, and turning the hearts of the people, from hearing and obaying Gods word. The Lord open their eyes, to see their sinnes, and make them truly religious; else remooue them from his Church and Ministers, &c. Now Sathan hauing thus farre, infused his poison, to Minister, and peoples bosoms (as we to our shame, and sorrow see it in to many places,) the holy coniunction betweene the Pastour, and the flock, from this little sparkle, of suspition at first, is quite, and for euer dissolued, and they (as man and wife) quite diuorced, and separated in heart, and louing affections. And therefore, I would haue my faithfull Christian, to be exceeding watchfull against this malady, and to suffer, not so much as the least shadow of dislike, to arise betweene him, and his Minister, else all the exercises of religion, executed by his Minister, for his saluation, shall become distastfull, and loathsome vnto him, for which contempt the Lord will bring an heauy curse vpon him, for treading vnderfoot,

his ordinance, and who wil then absolue him, and therefore, to preuent all mischiefes, and Apostacie, or Atheisme, let him instantly pray the Lord, against this rupture, and straine himselfe against all dislikes, or reports, to loue his pastour, as his father, to honour him as Gods seruant, to reuerence him as his guide to eternall life, and thinke nothing he possesseth to good, for him no more, then did the Galatians, who receiued Paul, as an Angel of God, yea as Christ Iesus, and if it had beene possible, would haue plucked out their own eyes and haue giuen them to him. Gal. 4. 14. 15. And sure it is, that neuer was their godly man, that hated his owne Minister, but euer his feete were beautifull to him, neuer was bad man that loued him, and therefore deserued the dust of their feete to be shaken against him, and so let my watchman preferre his owne Pastour, and in heart sincerely (as a chast matrone her husband) embrace him abone all other, how learned, or godly soeuer, and neuer depart from him, to heare any whiles he teacheth,

let him haue his due honour and desert for deseruing best, meete it is he should be best respected & it is meete it is, that he that hath the wintering of them, should haue the summering; for in time of plague or greatest troubles, when the flatterers forsake thee, yea and in death it selfe he must sticke vnto them) and that the gifts which his parishioners (in a pharisa

you, and not winke thereat, or glaunce a farre of, that you should not perceiue it, if you sinned of ignorance, he would instruct you, if of negligence, he would call vpon you, if of infirmitie, he would direct you, if of malice, hee would rebuke you, and so meete you at euery style, that you should not depart from the Lord, if he conferred with you, it should be about our sinnes, if he aduised and perswaded you any way, it should be to your saluation, where you did well, he would commend you, if amisse, be sorry with you, if things fell out crossely with you, he would aduise you, he would reioice at our prosperity; in your aduersitie he would comfort you in your sicknesse, and deepest disdresse, he would be our faithfull phisition, if ye mourned hee would weepe with you, if ye liued he would liue with you, if yee, died to doe you good, hee would die with you, and would euer, as well by night as day, pray God for your peace, and praise the Lord for appointing him watchman ouer so gracious and thankfull a people, when as by forsaking

and contemning him and his Ministery and following strangers, you shall cause him neglect, you and the rest of his flocke eate vp his heart with sorrow, leaue you open to all assaults, of Satan, the world and sinne, and finally, draw Gods iudgements vpon him and you. But of this more else-where.
            But to draw to an end, for endlesse would it be to me, to recite all the helps the Lord prouideth to assist, and vphold vs, in this holy watch; for who seeth not, how God watcheth ouer vs, in euery good worke, to prosper vs therein, then his Angels, attend vpon vs, all his creatures in heauen and earth fauour, and to their power helpe vs, the The fift helpe. All things helpe vs to watch. law directeth vs, the Gospel comforts vs, the Magistrate (whose life the Lord preserue) shieldeth vs, the Ministers instruct vs, the godly conferre with vs, all Gods Saints pray for vs, the time inuiteth vs, being peaceable, so that we may safely repaire vnto the house of the Lord, and euery of vs, in these halcion daies, (the Lord be highly praised for it) are freed from all lets, and perturbations,

so that we neede not goe in feare of the enemy, nor reade in feare, nor pray in feare, as in the Marrian daies, when none could reade a good booke, but still at euery period, they must be looking about, to spie, if any came to looke, and to accuse them, so that their state, was not vnlike the Iewes, returning from captiuitie, Who were faine to build with their trowels in the one hand, and their swords in the other, as is in Neh. 4. 17. But now, (if thou be not afraid of thine owne shadow) thou maiest securely sit vnder thy vine, and picke vp the foode of thy soule, in peace, and worke leisurely with both hands, because the Lord himselfe protecteth and watcheth ouer thee: so that no sooner art thou tempted by Satan, or alluréd to sinne by his members, to leaue or forsake thy watch, but forthwith the Lord of Hosts sendeth forth his spirit, his Angels, his graces, and all his creatures, as troopes of souldiours, and an armie royall to aide and assist thee, yea with vnited forces, to fight for thee, and so to compasse, and keepe thee that thou

shalt not giue ouer thy watch, nor disgrace thy holy profession. And to giue instance, in some on temptation; as for example, in whooredome: If (as was Ioseph) thou be sollicited to adultery, Gen. 39. and so to cut thy selfe from the Lord, 1. Cor. 6. 15. And depart from thy watch, and to open the gates of thy soule, for sinne and Satan to enter in, and robbe thee of thy chastitie, and all other graces, and so make thy soule an habitation for diuels, Matth. 12. 45. Thy danger is great, and heare (as a virgin in Gregorius Nazianzeus Orat. in Cyprianum. danger to be defloured, Deut. 22. 24. 27.) must thou mightily crie to the Lord, for present help, else thou art vndone, now (the Lord hearing thy prayer) forth-with sendeth out his armie royall to rescue thee, as thus. Before thou yeeld to the temptation, he granteth thee time sufficient to deliberate, whether to yeeld, or not. In which time, steppeth in Gods law as thy chiefe counsellour to disswade thee, condemning adultery Exod. 20. 14. Heb. 13. 4. to hell, and commending marriage as honorable: next in the necke thereof all to minde Gods plague, the executioners

of the sinne, threatning Gods curses, in this life death and eternall damnation in the life to come; this past, Gods feare frighteth, and terrifieth thy very soule, and spirit, which causeth the soule, with all the powers thereof, to quake and mourne within thee, and thy conscience vtterly to condemne, and accuse thee, then Christ sendeth his spirit, to minde thee of his sufferings, and holy couenant, the Gospell setteth broad his holy promises, the holy Spirit telleth thee, that thou must not defile his temple, the Angels (thy blessed watchmen) dread thy fall, and labour to pull thee from this pit, Satan watcheth for thy ruine to accuse thee, the torments of hell, as flames of lightning flash in the eyes of thy soule, hell it selfe gapeth for thee, the watchman of thy soule thundereth in thine eares, crying, stand in awe and sinne not, thy profession proclaimeth high treason against the Almightie, Christian fortitude encourageth to constancie, the shame of the word, and the preseruation of thy good name, deterre and violently keepe thee

backe, the defiling of thy bed, abusing thy wife, blemishing thy posteritie, make thee ashamed, the loue of God, of his word, of his image in thee and her, of the Church, and of heauen disswade from this frencie, yea chastitie in treateth thee to refraine from this vncleannesse, the filthinesse of the fact, and the troope of sinnes accompanying it, crie shame vpon rhee. Finally, all creatures in heauen, and earth (Satan, and reprobates accepted,) call vnto thee, to imitate their obedience, and loyaltie to thy Creatour, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, and not to breake his couenant, damne thy soule, forfeit thy Baptisme, and not receiue the grace of God in vaine: see then how God himselfe by these helps, and many more, is a present defender of thy chastitie, euen of this one gracious vertue, and in the midst of thy temptaon, opening thee away to escape with Ioseph, 1. Cor. 10. 13. And as of this, so of all other graces, and of the whole man; blessed be God euermore, for his continuall & constant watch ouer vs all both in life, and death: And therefore beloued,

thou being thus compassed with a cloud, yea with all helps in heauen and earth, be not wanting to help thy selfe: be sober, watch and pray, let nothing hinder nor trouble thee in this holy course of life, nor yet discourage thee, but cheerefully goe on in this watch; set thy selfe euer before the Lord, walke with thy God, let thy cheefest & onely care be, while thou liuest heere, how daily, and euermore, to passe the time of thy peregrination heere; according to Gods holy will reuealed in his sacred Word, and so constantly and faithfully perseuering vnto death, the Lord will giue thee a crowne of life, Reuel. 3. 10. which the Lord for his Christs sake grant thee, and me, Amen. And so farre of watchfulnesse for this life.
            Hauing discoursed hitherto how we Sect. 13. The second part of Death. ought to watch ouer ourselues, during our liues, thereby to liue according to Gods holy will, and to be beloued and blessed of God in this life. It followeth Transitio. next to exhort my vigilant Christian to watch and wait for Christs comming to iudgement, to receiue at his

hands, the Crowne of glory, laid vp as the price and reward of a godly life, according to Pauls exepctation, saying; I I haue fought a good fight, and haue finished my course, I haue kept the faith; from henceforth is laid vp for mee the Crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord, the righteous Iudge will giue me at that day, and not to me onely, but vnto all them also that loue his appearing, 2. Tim 47. 8. And Peter saith, Feed the flocke of God, &c. And when the chiefe Shepheard shall appeare, yee shall receiue an incorruptible Crowne of Glory. 1. Pet. 5. 2, 4. This then should bee my Christians next Watch, were it not that there lieth a soare and narrow bridge in the way for all flesh to passe ouer; and that is death, the meane and limit betweene life and iudgement; for so wee reade, It is appointed vnto men that they shall once die, and after that commeth the Iudgement. Heb. 9. 27. This is ineuitable, and none, be hee neuer so wise, foolish, strong, weake, ancient, rich or poore, or be he what hee can be, shall escape, but he must die, Psal. 89 48. and 2. Sam. 14. 14, and therefore it is called the way of

all the world, Iosh. 23. 14. This is the set ordinance & inuiolable Decree of God, that euery one that commeth into this world, commeth vpon this condition, charge, and arrest, not to haue any longer rest, stay, or abode heere; as haue the trees which are fastned heere by the rootes, but quickly to passe away, as doth the sliding and running water, and then for euer to depart, so soone as it shall please the Lord to call for him hence: so that of all terrible things this is the most fearefull, this is the last act of the Tragedy of mans miserable life to kill him dead, and looke how Death leaueth vs, so shall the last iudgement finde vs; for in this act Sathan winneth or loseth all: and to aggrauate the matter, Death is not onely implacable, sparing none, which caused the Heathen (though otherwise ouer-superstitious) neuer to sacrifice to Death, because it Orpheus in 
                     〈◊〉
                  . would bee bribed by no offerings nor prayers, but vncertaine is his comming; for we wot not when, where, nor after what manner it commeth, but often when we least looke or wish him, when

we are worst prouided, when we would faine yet a little dresse our lampes, & buy the oyle of Grace, then commeth hee in poast, and most terribly vexeth vs to the renting of soule and body, and how in the very agonies of Death, or in the point of our departure out of this life, he handleth vs, further then we see with our eyes, which is dolefull enough, we cannot tell, and therefore cannot to any purpose command & charge the watch. In other cases we are inlightned by the word, and our owne experience concurring. Heere the word is silent, and experience haue we none; and which is more, none of those men mentioned in the Old and New Testament, to be raised from the dead, as 1. Kin. 17. 22. and 2. Kin. 4. 34. 36. and 13. 21. and Math. 9. 25. 27. 52. Luke 7. 14. Ioh. 11. 44. Acts 9. 40 and 20. 10. nor yet Mat. 17. 3. spake a word, nor left any thing in writing concerning the state of such as departed this life in that moment, neyther what apparitions they saw at their last expiration, nor what temptations, what accusations of Sathan, what manner of

appearance before Christs tribunal sear, how acquitted, how condēned, which if they had, then shuld we haue spoken by sure experience, & known how to watch for the things done in Death, but knowing nothing, our wisdom is to speak nothing: and seeing al men die, some soon, some late, some after one fashion, some after another, but all full of sorrow and heauinesse, as euery one that goeth to the house of mourning may perceiue it stands vs much on hand to watch for it, and in all places, & at al houres to be ready appointed for it, that watcheth vs in euery place, & at al houres of the night, as day, to kill vs: neither booteth it vs to waste our goods on Physitians to keepe vs frō it; for albeit they promise faire, yet they & their babes die as soon as others, our Lawers cannot in this book-case plead, no not for their owne liues, no King so welthy, no Sampson so stout, no horse so swift, no spear so long, no armor of proof so sure, but as the Behemoth & Leuiathan, 
               Iob. 40. 41. he scorneth all. Therefore to preuent all the hurts & harms that accōpany Death & such as die vnprepared, I gather this doctrine.

The Lord said to Hezekiah by Isaiah, Put thine house in order, for thou shalt die, and not liue. And this did all the godly Fathers before their death, as Abraham disposed and prouided for his children before his death, Gen 25. 5. 6. Isaak & Iacob blessed their children, Gen. 27. and 48. and 49. so did Moses blesse the twelue Tribes, exhorting them also to serue the Lord: and the like did Ioshua, Deutr. 33. Iosh 23. and 24. and Dauid did the like, prouiding further for the Temple and the functions thereof, 1. Chron. 22. to the end of that booke, that God might bee serued after his death, better then while he liued Abraham, Iacob, and Ioseph, had an holy care for their buriall, Gen. 23. and 49. and 50. Simon and Paul desired to die in peace and bee with Christ our Sauiour, and Steuen commended their soules

to God, forgaue and prayed for their enemies, &c. Then Moses desired God to teach him to number his dayes, that he might apply his heart to wisedome, Psal. 90. 12
                  •
                This also by a voyce from heauen is confirmed to be a blessed thing, as Reu. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead which hereafter die in the Lord, euen so saith the Spirit; for they rest from their labors, and their works follow them: And contrarily, how fearefull it is to die vnprepared, we see in that Corne hoorder, who when hee made most account to eat, drinke, take his ease, and be merry, that night his soule was taken from him, Luk. 12. 15. to 23. Reasons ratifie Reasons. this truth likewise.

            3. At our death time Satan is most 3. subtle, busie, and fierce, to ouerthrow

our faith; for if now hee preuaileth against vs, he hath gotten his wished desire, but if now he be vanquished, he is out of hope euer to preuaile, and so layeth downe the bucklers at our feete for euer: therefore stands it vs much on hand to watch, and for want hereof many goe meerely to the pit of perdition.
            4. Death by this premeditation and 4. preparation will be more welcome vnto vs, for dangers foreseene are lesse greeuous.
            5. I shall more easily contemne this world, by often thinking that I am a 5. stranger in it, and abstaine from many sinnes which otherwise I would commit, and will repent of all my sins committed, and omitted, and the rather, because all Gods Elect did so and were saued and so shall I.
            6. God commands vs to watch, for commanding vs to watch for the day of 6. iudgement, he will haue vs make a godly death, for as wee die, so shall wee be iudged, and therefore must bee watchfull, and pray much for a godly end.
            7. If we performe this duty, many 7.
               
commodities accompany it, if not vndoubted damnation to all that die in sin vnrepented; for death in it selfe is the way to hell to the wicked, but to the godly a portall, by which the soule passeth out of the fraile body to heauen; or is as the Angell that guided Peter out of prison, and sets them at liberty, Acts 12. 8. 9. whereas to the wicked it is a cruell Sergeant to arest and cast them into prison. Sect. 15. Vse 1.
            
            The first vse serues for instruction for my vigilant Christian, how hee is to watch generall and speciall for death: The first generall care whereof is, in leading 1 a godly life, and then shall hee be sure of a godly and blessed death; for eternall life, hath three degrees, one in this life, when a man leades a new sanctified heauenly life, and can say truely that now hee liues not, but Christ liueth in him, Galath. 2. 20. and this all such can Obseruations for preparatiō to die well. say as doe vnfainedly repent, beleeue, and obey, iustified from, and sanctified against their sinnes, and haue the peace of Conscience, with other good gifts & graces of the holy spirit, which are the

earnest penny of their saluation; The second degree is in the end of this life at our death, when the body goeth to the earth, and soule to God; the third at the last iudgement, when body and soule revnited doe ioyntly enter into eternall blisse, and of this first watch, I haue spoken in the first part before.
            Then secondly we must watch and be 2. in readinesse for the second degree of eternall life, euen for death; for man goeth to the house of his age, as Eccles. 12. 5. that is, towards his graue, and therefore must prepare for it, and labour to pluck out of our hearts that erroneous imagination, wherewith euery man naturally blesseth himselfe, thinking so highly of himselfe, that though hee had one foot in the graue, yet beleeues hee shall not yet die: and what a folly is it for man to stumble thus at the threshold, ere they be aware of the house, many charge, and chide, olde age to come vpon them vnexpected, but who compelleth them thus falsly to conclude? So if any complaine of Deaths vnlooked-for approach, wee may answer, Who bade

them bee so foolish, as not to looke for him? Cruell and vnmercifull Death makes league with no man, though (as Isai saith, chap. 28. 15. 18.) The wicked make a league with Death, that is, in the fond imagination, thinking that Death will not come neere them, though all the world should be destroyed; and seeing this naturall corruption is in euery mans heart, we must daily fight against it, and expell it out; for so long as it preuailes, we shall be vtterly vnfit to make any preparation for death, but will bee like the foolish debtor, that keepes no account of his debt, and then maruells how the Creditor should remember to demand it: thou hast owed this debt euer since thou wast borne, and before thou wast borne, and is it strange, that now, after some yeares past, thou art called vpon for it? what if the day of payment be not expressed in the counterpane, that which is presently, and at all times due, must continually be in readinesse.
            Thirdly, we must labour to meditate often and seriously of our death, and of

the state of the dead whereunto wee all hasten; for rich & poore shall lie down alike in the dust, and the wormes shall couer them, saith Iob. chap. 21. 23. to 26. but because our selfe-loue and world inesse is so great, that wee account nothing so bitter and vntoothsome, as the meditations of our departure, as Ecclus. 41. 1. O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liueth at rest in his possessions, vnto the man that hath nothing to vexe him, and that hath prosperitie in all things, yea vnto him that is able to receiue meate: and therfore let vs strengthen this practice with prayer, as did Dauid and Moses, Psal. 39. 4. and 90. 12. so wee may bee inabled to resolue our selues of death continually, for how soeuer by a generall speculation wee thinke sometimes something of our ends, yet vnlesse the spirit of God be our Schoolmaster to teach vs this duty, wee shall bee neuer able soundly to resolue our selues of the presence and the speedines of death, for hee alone must lighten our mindes with knowledge, and fill our hearts with his grace, that wee may

rightly consider hereof, and so esteeme of euery day and houre, as if it were the very day and houre of our death. So the dangers foreseene will be lesse greeuous, and we shall more easily contemn this world, with the vanities thereof, and keepe our selues in good fashion, (according to the Prouerbe, Remember the end, and thou shalt neuer doe amisse, Ecclus. 7. 36.) and approoue right Christians: for (as saith Gregorie) The life of a Christian is nothing else but a continuall meditation of Death; and as a watchman euer thinketh and looketh for the enemies comming, and therefore will not sleepe; so must wee often meditate of death, and make account that euery present day shal be our dying day, and euery night our bed to be our graue: and so for that remnant of time wee haue to liue euer walke in the feare of God, and so hee shall neuer need to feare Death, who by a godly life hath giuen due entertainment to the feare of God.
            We must not onely be euery day willing 4. to die, but bee ready with oyle in our Lamps, esteeming euery day the last

day of our liues; which that wee may the more cheerefully doe, we must endeuour before death come, to pull out the stings of death, that is, the power & strength thereof, by true repentance and faith in Christ Iesus. Sampson was soone vanquished when the Philistines found where his great strength lay; and thou mayest put safely a serpent in thy bosome, if thou pull out his sting, so take sinne away which is the sting of Death, then may Death (as a Bee without a sting) hum and buzze about thine eares, but not harme thee: wherefore if wee would liue when we are dead, wee must die to sinne, and to the world and flesh while we are aliue, and not omit these duties.
            1. To humble our selues for all our Duties. 1. sinnes past, confessing them wholly against our selues, and in prayer crying instantly to God for pardon of them.
            2. For the time to come, to turne to 2. God, and to carry a purpose, resolution, and endeuour in all things to reforme both heart and life, according to Gods word.
            
               
3. We must euer beleeue in Christ, by whom the sting of death is taken out, for they onely feare Death, who feare and doubt whether Christ died for them; if then Death hath bin slaine by Christ Iesus, then now to the faithfull it is no death, but a sleepe, a separaration, a passing from the world, and a going vp to God, a disioyning of the soule from the body, Philip. 1. 22. 23. Ioh. 13. 3. and a consecration (as if wee said) it is a solemne ceremony by which the faithful are wholly consecrated and dedicated vnto God, to the end that hereafter they should render vnto him, no other sacrifice, nor exercise, but to sing and set forth the prayses of God, & to sanctifie his holy name, and so it is called Baptisme also; for that by Death we passe (as Israell through the red Sea and Iordan) to the Holy Land of the liuing: for the thing that maketh vs most feare death, is, that we behold it in the myrrour of the Law, which sets it forth vnto vs vnder a shape, and shew that is very fearefull to looke vnto, and vnder the forme of a Sergeant, armed with the

anger and wrath of God, and accompanied and guarded with all the threats and curses of the Law, against all those that violate & transgresse the same, who commeth violently and implacably to serue his writ to arest vs, to appeare before Gods high Tribunall, (all excuses set apart) and to receiue the sentence of damnation to hel fire eternally, without ease or release, baile or maine-prize; which dealing of Death is so terrible to the flesh and soule of a sinner, that the very remembrance of it is exceeding bitter to a man that is sowsed and soaked in the pleasures of this world; for it now flattereth none, regardeth no persons, weigheth not friendship, careth not for rewards to looke vnto, but in imagination is very grimme, ougly, and cruell, and killeth downe-right without mercy where it hitteth, and who can abide his comming. Now to free vs from this sight, fright, and feare, we are to behold Death in the myrrour of the Gospell, stinglesse, disarmed, and conquered by Christ, and so swallowed vp in victory for vs his Beloued and Elect.
            
               
5. Seeing then that the sting of death is sinne, and that the power and force of euery mans particular death and iudgement lieth in his owne sinnes, wee must heerein be exceeding watchful to spend our time and study in vsing all good meanes, that our sinnes may be remoued and pardoned; for see how many sinnes be in thee, so many stings of sinne be in thee also, which wound thy soule to death: therefore let not one sin remain, for which thou hast not humbled thy selfe, and repented seriously: and if we will liue eternally, let vs begin to liue that eterna'l life before wee die, which is the first degree of eternity. Let vs now rise to a new life, by the first resurrection, that we may haue part in the latter, Reuel. 20. 6. and now labour for sauing knowledge, that we need not be Catechized on our death-bed. Now labour we for true peace of conscience, that we be not to agree with our aduersary when we are arested, and when it is too late, we hauing nothing to pay, yet we see to our sorrow, that of all businesse this is least respected, much care is for the tenement

the body, little for the tenant the soule, and least for the Landlord Christ Iesus. But such as hasten not their worke, shew they looke not for their Master, and they that take no care of paying their rent, shew they despise their Landlord, to their own losse, hurt, and confusion.
            6. Study, and exercise daily the Art 6. of dying, most men lay how to liue in the world, but a Christians care should be how to die well out of this world, and that master-care carrieth about all the inferiour and subordinate cares and affaires of this life: therefore let vs invre and accustome our selues daily, by little and little to die before death come; for hee that leaues the world before the world leaues him, reacheth the hand to death, as to a welcome messenger, and with Simeon departs in wished peace: and as men that are appointed to runne a race, exercise themselues before in running, that they may get the victory, so should we begin to die now while we are liuing, that we might die well in the end; so Paul, 1. Cor. 15. 31. said, that hee

died daily, not so much for that hee was daily in danger of death, by reason of his calling, but for that in all his dangers and troubles hee inured and exercised himselfe to die; for when men do make the right vse of their afflictions, and endeuour to beare them patiently, humbling themselues as vnder the correction of God, then they begin to die well: and to doe this indeed, is to take an excellent course. He that would mortifie his greatest sinnes, must begin to doe it with small sinnes, which when they are once reformed, a man shall be able more easily to ouercome his miseries; so likewise he that would beare the crosse of all crosses, namely death it selfe, must first of all learne to beare small crosses, as sickenesse, troubles, losses, which may fitly be tearmed little deaths, and the beginning of death it selfe, and wee must first of all acquaint our selues with these little deaths, before wee can be able to beare the greatest death of all. Against the afflictions and calamities of this life, are as it were the Harbingers and Purueyors of Death, and we must first learn

how to entertaine these messengers, that when the Master shall come, wee may in better manner welcome and cheere him.
            7. As many as bee able to doe any 7. good seruice, eyther for Gods glory or his Church, or Common-wealth, or to any priuate man or woman, because his departure hence is vncertaine, and the night of his day draweth on, hee must hasten with all speed to doe it, lest death preuent him, and it be laid to his charge, so that hee loose his reward, for this point note, Eccles. 9. 10. Iohn 9. 4. Galat. 6. 10. And hee that hath care to spend his daies in well-doing, shall with much comfort & peace of conscience end his life, for he that labours for the good of others, shall be beloued while he is here, and lamented when he is gone; but such as onely make worke for themselues, as hogs at the trough, both liue without being desired, nor beloued, and dying are neuer missed, nor lamented. Let vs then doe all to Gods glory and mens good, and thus farre of our generall watch.
            
               
Next followes our particular vvatch for death, as thus.
            So soone as wee feele sickenesse seize The particular watch for death. vpon our bodies, then is it high time to begin our particular watch and preparation for death: where,
            1. Wee must consider whence our 1 sickenesse commeth, euen by the speciall prouidence of God; and the cause of this affliction is our sinne, as Lam. 3. 30. Mich. 7. 9. Math. 9. 2. Iohn 5. 14. Wherfore is the liuing man sorrowfull? Man suffereth for his sinne, and though there be no other causes of our death, yet sickenesse comes ordinarily and vsually of sinne: and therefore speedily must we make a new examination of our hearts, and all our liues passed, & say with Israell: Let vs search and try our wayes, and turne againe vnto the Lord, Lamen. 3. 40. and so labour to bee reconciled vnto him in Christ, though wee haue formerly beene long assured of his fauour.
            
            2. Wee must make a new confession vnto God of our new and particular sinnes, not forgetting the old, specially the sinnes of our youth, and ignorance

before our calling: and thereto. Thirdly 3. make new prayers, and more earnest then euer before, with vnexpressed sighes and grones of the spirit, and that for pardon of the same sinnes, and for full reconciliation with God in Christ. In the exercise of these three duties stands the renouation of our faith and repentance, whereby they are increased, quickened, and reuiued: and the more sickenesse preuailes in the body, the more should we be carefull to put them in vre, that spiritual life might encrease, as temporall life is decayed, then are we to forgiue, and desire to be forgiuen of all the world, specially of our owne Minister.
            4. If our paines and sickenesse discourage vs, wee are to set speedily our 4. house in order, and then send for our Parish Minister, who if it may be, must not be absent from vs while breath is in our bodie, but to exhort, perswade, encourage, answere our doubts, pray with vs, and for vs, help vs in our feares and temptations, and (as a Bride for her Bridegroome make vs ready, attyring

vs in the wedding garment, and robes royall, for the marriage of the Sonne of God: neyther must their godly neighbours be now absent, but as they haue been formerly privy to our godly liues, so if we accuse and condemne our selues, they must testifie the truth of vs, further then the Ministers knowledge extends, and so comfort and set them as eye and care-witnesses of our former life, in assured hope of vndoubted saluation.
            5. And because no godly meanes 5. must be omitted to preserue life till God take it away, the Physitians skill is not to be refused, obseruing this order; that where the Diuine ends there the Physitian must begin, and not contrarily; for let vs neuer look for health in body, vntill wee haue a faithfull and sanctified soule, desiring God to blesse the meanes he vseth for vs, which we truely cannot doe vntill our Consciences perswade vs of the pardon of our sinnes.
            6. This done, let vs set our soules in 6. order, and see how wee stand in the fauour of God, and so shall wee die more voluntarily, quietly, and patiently, and

let vs labour that our sinnes die in vs, before we die in the world: and consider we, what an excellent thing it is for vs, to end our liues before our deaths, and in such sort, that at that houre wee haue nothing to doe but to die, and that then we haue need of nothing, no not of time, nor of our selues, &c. but sweetly and comfortably to depart this life.
            7. This sanctified preparation will 7. cause vs, not onely ioyfu

Blessed are those seruants whom the Lord when he commeth shall find waking, &c. and so, set their house in good order, for they must die. The second day 2. they spend in meditating vpon death, the precedents and horror thereof, to whom they willingly yeeld, yet so, that by faith in Christ, true repentance, and renued obedience, they sweeten the ta

               ly & comfortably to drinke of this cup, Math. 20. 22. 23. The third day they thinke 3. vpon their sins, and with broken and contrite hearts confesse them to the Lord. Psal. 32. 5. 6. 7. and that with such vehement feruency of spirit, & earnest sweating agonie in soule, as if within that day or houre they shuld by death be attached. 4. The fourth day, with their greatest deuotion, and most careful preparation, they come to the holy Communion, which they call viaticum, and so victuall

themselues therewith for reliefe in their iourney to heauen, ioyning therevnto the reading and preaching of Gods sacred word, applying the same to the present purpose, so nye as may be, suting and agreeing with Christs last Sermon in the Chamber before his death, Iohn 13. and 14. 15. and 16. not without prayer, and praise to the holy Trinity. I he fift day they spend in meditation and prayer, for the more liuely and effectuall 5. working of Gods holy Spirit in their harts, the better entertainment of Gods sacred word in their soules, and opening of their eyes to see their weakenes, wickednesse, and accursednesse, and for wished power to ouercome all temptations assaulting their soules, specially at their death-time. The sixth day in all humblenesse of heart, and feruentnesse 6 of deuotion, they pray for a spirituall death, wholly, heauenly, free from all doubtings, greefe, temptations, or fears, with an infallible sight of the Sonne of God, in some, though small manner, & most comfortable feeling & apprehension of the ioyes of heauen, & contempt

of this world, with the perfect fulfilling to them of all Gods promises, made to them for the life to come; and that whatsoeuer holy duty is in them wanting, by ignorance, or weakenesse, the holy spirit of God would suggest vnto them, and supply, that so the whole glory might be the Lords, and to them in life and in death, Christ should be aduantage, Phil. 1. 21▪ and that walking through the valley of the shadow of death, they should feare nothing; for the Lord would be with them, and his Angels safely conduct them to Paradise. The 7. seuenth day they giue hearty thanks to Almighty God for the innumerable benefits bestowed vpon them, spiritually and temporally, beseeching his maiesty to continue the same so far forth as hee seeth expedient for them, vowing to make the rest of their life (if any part be remaining) a perpetuall Sabbath vnto the Lord, vntill they bee translated to his kingdome, where, with all his Angels and Saints they shall solemnize an euerlasting Iubilie: then, this day they vse a deepe meditation and repetition

of all the exercises of the sixe daies going before, and to euery of these dayes, they select certaine fit Psalmes and praiers, &c.
            And thus according to my skill haue I charged my watch-man in the best manner I could deuise, to prepare for death; and when I haue done all, I find my selfe vnable to finde the depth of this principle for want of experience, which I cannot learne vntill I dye my selfe: Onely this I know, that albeit this watch be vnreprooueable and necessary for all Christians, yet (as we see in a Master of Fence) if a strong champion set vpon him, he will soone set him out of all his fence, and make a foole of him; so if Death assaile vs aboue our nature and strength, wee will soone forget all these instructions, and fall to cursing & blaspheming, and no man woteth with what violence death will assault him, therefore would I wish him euer to lead a godly life, and keepe a carefull watch, annexing to the first obseruations, this weekely Diary, and that circularly, that is, weeke after weeke to renew it, to our

dying day, and then (to both) to desire the Lord himselfe to watch ouer vs, else all will be in vaine, when we haue done all, we are so weake and corrupt, yea and ignorant of this way by Deaths doore to Heauen, but if the Lord assist vs with his holy spirit, wee shall not misse of a prosperous voyage; for if God be with vs, who can be against vs? and questionlesse he will be with vs, if wee carefully keepe this watch; and though wee know not the way, further then with our eyes we see it, yet he knowes it, and euery balke, and temptation, and stumbling stone, and will both put in our hearts how to answere euery temptation, Acts 1

                     〈◊〉
                  . and (as Peter out of prison) will lead vs safely that nothing shall let vs, for his owne Names sake. And therefore let vs confidently sticke vnto the Lord, and he will sticke vnto vs, for hee hath said, I will not faile thee, neyther forsake thee: Iosh. 1. 9. Heb. 13. 5. Luk. 22. 43.
            The second Vse serues to put vs in Vse 
                     〈◊〉
                   To put vs in mind of Death. minde of Death; for seeing it is thus conuenient & profitable for vs to watch against Death, and so dangerous, and

pernitious to forget death, vntill it sodainly taketh vs away vnprepared, we must subscribe to the iudgement of the godly, and also of Heathen writers, who would haue mans life to be but a meditation of Death, because it meeteth both young & old at euery stile, and for that nothing is more dangerous nor comfortlesse to any, then at an vnawares, full of sinne, and full of the world, to be arrested by Death; for if thou look about thee, thou shalt finde Death painted in euery place and worke thou doest. And therefore thinke vpon it, not as thou wouldest of a thing that were to come, or some deuised figment, but euen as Gods messenger now present; and withall, not as a thing appertaining onely to others, but belonging to thy selfe: The Indian Gymnosophists, called Brachmanes, 
               A good example. were so carefull to make their liues a continuall meditation of Death, that they had their graues alwaies open before the gates of their houses, to the end that at their going out, and comming in, they might euer be mindfull of their passage to death: and this house of earth,

(to wit our graues) is the schoole of true wisedome, where God teacheth those that be his, the misery and vanity of this life; and whereas the world considereth no more but the painted face of Iezabel shining gaily at a window, and not the miserable and extreame parts of her, which (after her body was eaten vp of dogges) God would haue to remaine whole, that thereby, as in a figure vvee might see, that the world is another manner of thing indeed, then it appeareth in shew, and that we should in such wise consider the face of it, as also to be mindfull also of the extreame griefes & sorrowes, wherein the glory of it endeth. 2. King. 9. 30.
            1. Let vs then preuent this misery, The commodities of thinking vpon our death. and thinke on our death, for this will first make the proudest Peacocke 
                  •
               ay downe his fairer feathers, so often as hee thinketh vpon it, though hee pricke them vp againe when hee draweth his eye from this glasse.
            2. It will make vs serue God sincerely, the feare of whom is the beginning of wisedome. Marriners while they saile

peaceably, giue themselues to all riot and disordered excesse; but when the tempest beateth into their shippe, and death is before their eyes, they cry mightily to God: so we, rocked in the cradle of security, as in a ship, glutte the forbidden fruit; but stricken in aduersity, loath this life, and labor for a better.
            3. The memory of Death causeth vs to know that none of these things can be called ours, which wee cannot carry with vs out of this world; and therfore while we haue time, wee should doe all good with them we can.
            4. In what calling soeuer a man bee, hee cannot choose but deale vprightlie in most things, if he doe but remember hee must die; for what ambitious man would be proud of his honour and offices, seeing he must die, when all honor, wealth, and glory shall forsake him, and another shall step in his roome as proud as he, and when his glasse is runne out, another shall succeed him, &c. vntill Death catch all as fish in his nette: and to what purpose should I hoord money, or purchase Lands, &c. seeing that Nakednesse

shall be my last end, Iob 1. 21. Of the want of this consideration, arise all errors & deceits; for vvho vvou
                  •
               d haue a sparke of presumption to sinne, that knevv his end shortly to bee dust and ashes, or would make his belly his God, that were sure shortly his belly should become worms meat: or would bestow one penny in building, that were perswaded the graue should become his Pallace: or braue himselfe in braueries, considering hee shall be turned (hee knowes not how soone) out of all, yea out of house and home, in a poore winding sheet. Therefore (beloued) let vs adhorre all vanities, which doe but make vs vnwilling to die, and open the gates of our soules to all our spirituall enemies: a rule in policy it is, to vvatch and ward that City which is beseeged round about; and such as vvould keepe their cities in flourishing estate, must euer be watchfull, as if their enemies Hannibal adportas. were at the gates: so our Sauiour, seeing that wee haue enemies on euery side, and that Death, the terriblest enemie knocketh at our gates, & foreseeing

the danger might come of our sleepie security, commendeth to his Church, and commandeth watchfulnesse; and therefore let vs not bee wanting to our own saluation, but euer desire the Lord to grant vs this grace, to number our daies aright, and aboue all, to perswade our faithlesse hearts, that wee cannot heere long continue, but must die.
            The next Vse serues for comfort against Vse 3. Not to fear Death. the feare of Death; for, 1. If against the comming of Death wee be watchfull, and euery way prepared (as is aboue said) then need wee not feare Death, for then we shall die in the Lord, and the Angell, and Gods Spirit pronounceth from Heauen, that such are blessed, as is, Reucl. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth, yea saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them. If then it be a blessed thing to die in the Lord, we need not feare it; for all manner of seare presupposeth some euill and danger, for we are not afraid of a good thing, but affect it offered vs, and receiue it cheerefully. If then wee

be not in danger of the second death, as none that die in the Lord are, it is folly to dread it, seeing it is a blessed thing. If a towne be well furnished with victualls, (as was Babilon, which was prouided for twenty yeares, as writ Xenophen and Herodotus) though the towne be besieged, the people within are secure, but being vnstored, quaketh for fear, whence we may iudge of what importance it is, to preuent dangers, and be well prepared in time; for that which astonisheth many at their death, is, that they are suddenly taken at vnawares, and vnprouided, and this makes them vnpatient, and to cry for some respit, to make them ready for Death, that is, the Lord must stay for them stil: but let them watchfully prepare for Death, and wait for the Lord as is meet, and say, Come Lord Iesu, come quickly.
            
            2. The vnprepared want faith; for had they neuer so little faith, it would free them from this feare, and would animate them against all terrors, as Psal. 46. 1. &c. for as the body, so long as the soule remaineth therein, liueth; so

man, so long as Faith abides in his soule, needeth not feare Death, no more then we feare sickenesse, whiles wee enioy perfect health, or pouerty while wee abound in wealth.
            3. There is no feare of death, where there is no sinne; for sinne is the cause that God depriueth vs of life, but the vigilant and godly, in time pull out the stings of Death, and in Christ their sins are couered, and not imputed vnto them, Psal, 32. 1. 2. Rom. 4. 7. and they sinne not, 1. Iohn 3. 9. yea now, to them death it selfe is slaine, and swallowed vp in victory, by the death of Christ, 1. Cor. 15. 54. 55. 56. foreseeing that the prick or sharpnesse of Death is sinne, and the power of sinne is death, Iesus Christ hath accomplished the Law for vs, and thereby taken away the sting of Death, so that it shall neuer hurt vs any more, and so to vs death now is no death, but an entrance to life.
            4. God is euer with the Elect in their troubles, and will not for sake them, and though they walke in the valley of the shadow of death, they will feare nothing, Psal.
               
23. 1. 4. Gen. 46. 4. Luke 22. 43. hee being with them, how can they feare; to say nothing, that he is in league and couenant with them, to doe them all good, and to remooue from them all harmes and hurts, as Isa. 43. 1. &c. Feare not, I haue redeemed thee, I haue called thee by name, thou art mine, when thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the riuers they shall not ouerflow thee, when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not bee burnt, neyther shall the flame kindle vpon thee, &c.
            
            5. Death is but a passage or vvay to life, which now is so broad and smooth beaten by all Gods Saints, that a man may blindly, in the darke, tread it without stumbling.
            6. Such as die in the Lord, rest from their labors, and their workes follow them: and what labouring man after his dayes toyle and trauell would not rest from his labours, and betake him to his bed, and sleep: so we by death shall rest from all the miseries whereunto this life is subiect, and shall sleepe as in our beds, and what a blisse is this, specially to the

godly, who of all others in this life bee most miserable; for they are subiect, not onely to the common calamities of this life, as of sicknesse, pouerty, losses, &c. but also besides these, the world doth hate reuile & persecute them, & that so bitterly and extreamely, that many of them be imprisoned, racked, and tormented, and cruelly put to death, as Heb 11. 36. &c. and 2. Cor. 11. 23. &c. So that to them it is a great happinesse to rest from their labours, and yet to rest from their labors by Death, is but a part, and not perfect blisse or happines; for then a labouring Oxe, or trauelling Horse were happy when they died, yet they loath & tremble to die: but they that die in Christ, haue another increase of happinesse, for they enter into glory, and their workes, that is, the reward of their workes follow them: for they shall bee in euerlasting ioy, why then should Gods children feare death, seeing it is an end of present euills, and a beginning of felicitie eternall.
            7. Death bringeth vs in glory to see God our Father, and Iesus Christ our

sweet Sauiour, and the Holy Ghost our sanctifier, of whom wee haue seene nothing hitherto, but his pourtrait described by the Prophets & Apostles, which one thing ought to moue vs more then any thing to desire our dissolution; for if the Queen of Saba came so farre to see Salomon, and to heare his Wisedome, how farre should wee goe to heare a greater then Salomon, Luke 11. 31. Saint Austin wished he had liued to see, Roman triumphantem, Paulum praedicantem, & Christum in carne: but those sights were nothing to these in the highest Heauens, wher Christ with all his Angels & Saints triumph in glory; for now shall that blessing of our Sauiour in Luke 10. 23. be perfectly in vs fulfilled, viz. Blessed are the eyes that see the things that ye see; for I tell you, that many Prophets and Kings haue desired to see these things which ye see, and haue not seene them, &c. the only contemplation of whom, will make vs fully content, and will dampe and take from vs, the remembrance and sense of all other profits and pleasures whatsoeuer. Then with him wee shall see all the Angells,

Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs and Saints of God, who haue in all ages excelled in vertue and godlinesse, with all the holy Preachers, who shine as the Sunne and Starres in the firmament of Heauen; a sight surpassing that which Socrates hoped after his death to see, to Plato in Apol. Socrat. Cicero, Tuscul. quest. lib. 1. wit, the Noble Heathens that liued before him, as Agamemnon, Aiax, Vlisses, &c.
            8. By Death our soules shall be separated from our bodies, and made more free and capable of the profound mysteries of Gods Hierarchy, and Heauenly Kingdome: for then the vaile being remoued from our eyes, and (as Nazianzen 
               
                  Nazianzens saying of the ioyes of heauen. writeth) Our heauenly soules no longer pressed downe by our earthly bodies, wee shall see the Lord face to face, and know him as wee are knowne, 1. Cor. 13. 2. and plainely behold that which we now worship; for them shall we enter into the sanctuary of our God, euen to the Holy of Holies, & there will God shew vnto vs, (as to his intire friends) the whole glory and riches of his house and blessed kingdome, and keepe nothing backe from vs. Blessed Death, wilt

thou not make hast to come and conduct vs thither, for thou art the wholesome Physicke which curest vs of all diseases and afflictions, and by casting vs into, and vnder the earth, liftest vs to the highest heauens, to liue with God for euer.
            
            9. Death is to vs the beginning of life, which Epaminondas a Heathen, at his Death could see, saying to his frends, Epaminondas his saying. Ignatius.

            10. Death is to be desired before life, and the day of our decease, before the day of our Natiuity. (I meane in respect onely of

temporall good and euill, prosperity & aduersity, else not) for by our birth wee enter to sorrow, and by death end it, and goe vp to God, wherefore in olde time Sepulchers were built in Gardens, as Ioh. 19. 41. not only among our sports to put vs in mind of our ends, and so to vse the same moderately; but also to teach vs that ioy and pleasure is a consequence of death, and an entry to Gods Paradise of pleasure: and therefore let vs liue to God, and Death shall not hurt vs.

I answer: here is a great deale of good stuffe pact together, if wee had time to vndoe and consider it. But in the meane while, know ye that wee desire nothing of you more then the Lord exacteth of his dearest children, and therfore not to be trodden vnder foote by you; for we liue not by examples, but by the Lawes of the Almighty, whereunto all men ought in all humility bee obedient, before father, or life it selfe, neyther is heere any thing pressed, but what your selues know to be requisite, and could wish ye did, if you (as many and most men doe, and you must) lay vpon your death-beds, knowing & feeling what they miserable men doe. Yet if you refuse this diet as ouer tart, take then your owne, no man will blame me for giuing you good counsell; and because I giue you ouer, yet follow wise Salomons aduise, and that the rather, for

that without compulsion, you often, of your owne accord, vse it, viz. Goe to the 
               Goe to the house of mourning. 
               house of mourning, for there is the end of all men, and hee that is liuing, taketh it to heart. Eccles. 7. 2. where hee would haue all men bestow sometime daily to think what pressures and agonies shall assault vs at the houre of death; and for the better consideration hereof, hee would haue vs goe to the house of mourning, (and not of banqueting) and there behould a man dying, and that we should marke the heauy accidents, and painfull passions of that houre, and take it to heart; for as it fareth to day with him, so shall it tomorrow fare with thee, and with all the world: this thou canst learn without his or any further direction, for comming to the house to visit thy neighbours, there shalt thou see a very sick man, forsaken now of naturall heat, Eccles. 12. 2 to 8. his senses without much mouing, his face like lead, the bowles of his eyes sunke in his head, his mouth full of fleame and some, his throat ratling, his tongue swollen, his necke winding euery side, his breast beateth and panteth

for life, ready to burst for paine, the veynes still, all infallible tokens of death. Now take this to heart, and take the case to be thine own, for this is the way of all the world, and then now seeing and viewing such perplexed extremities in others, reflect, and represent the like image to bee shortly in thy selfe, Imagine that thou lay vpon thy death-bed, that thy Physitions had now giuen thee ouer, thy friends and kinsfolke stood weeping & wringing their hands about thy bed, vnable to help or comfort thee, but rather augment the greefe of thy departure, and thou the while speechlesse and helpelesse: O how dreadfull shall this departure and last farewell be, to thee and to them! where wealth shall not asswadge thy woe, but plunge thee deeper in the gulph of calamity, neither honours assist thee, for thou must leaue them with like vehement smart as thou gottest them, with greedy desire, and badde conscience thy wonted delights breed within thy soule, that neuer-dying worme, and neuer-quenched fire: what counsell wilt thou heere take, who formerly

hast refused all good connsell, couldest not abide to heare of death, no more canst now, to goe out of thy body, will bee too intollerable, to abide within is vnpossible, to deferre the time (to end thy will but vntill to morrow) will not bee granted, death is in poasthaste, now art thou abashed that thou diddest not watch and prepare for this houre: Oh hadst thou wist, but it is too late, now thou cryest, fye, fye vpon thy brutish behauiour, and now for feare & horror wouldest flee from thy selfe; for then shalt thou see thy selfe beset with horrible monsters, that is, with thine owne sinnes, which (as furies) pursue and hedge thee in, all the time past shall seeme vnto thee as the twinkling of an eye, but the time to come, endlesse, pittilesse, and remedilesse; so that thou maist truly say, The snares of Death compasse me round about, and the pangs of hell got hold vpon mee, and I shall finde trouble and heauinesse, &c. Psal. 116. 3. 4.
            But returne wee to our sicke man againe, whom vnexpected Death frustrateth of all his counsels, and could not

come in a worse time; for now hee curteth off violently the webs of all his deuises, and with one pellet ouerthroweth all his castles built in the ayre: then commeth in the Physitian with his; It will not be, thinke (good sir) no longer of life, you must be gone: These be heauy tidings, then his sorrowes shall bee vnspeakeably encreased, when he recounteth with himselfe, that his body, which now hath some life in it, shall after an houre be depriued of sense, life, spirit & soule; for if it be an hard matter to bee pulled away from these things which no doubt so neerely toucheth man, how bitter (I pray you) will be the separation of the body from the soule; for such two louing familiar friends (which haue alwaies liued sweetly together) cannot be diuided without vnspeakable griefe, if the Oxe doe commonly low and mourne when his yoke-fellow (which was wont to draw with him) is taken away, how will euery one of vs mourne, when the soule shall bee separated from the body, and as Sathan in our life time, set forth to him Gods mercy, & nothing

but Mercy, hiding his Iustice; so vvill he now extenuate his mercy, and presse his iustice to draw him to desperation, so that now all his sinnes vvhich hee in his life-time committed, vnrepented, & vvith so great facility, shall violently at once rush vpon him, as an armed host of bloudy enemies, vvhich vvith open eyes, hee shall novv to his shame and damnation behold; oh how heauy and grieuous vvill they then seeme to bee, vvhich formerly vve

God in his life time, shall be forsaken of God in Death (if repentance preuent not) and thus in the end, the soule remoueth to his place, and the body to the earth whence it came: now this is thy case, and therefore though we cannot escape Death, yet let vs escape the sting and bitternesse of this Death: for the true vvisdome of man is, to measure all his actions by the squire of his short life, and so to goe through all temporall affaires, that he lose not the eternall, and if some small losse of goods or preferment take away our sleepe, what should the meditation of assured death doe? should vve not doe as in games of actiuity at Olympus, exercise our selues some fiue yeares before, that in the day of triall, we might winne the prize, so we should now consider al inconueniences in death, and against the game day be sure to get the prize, and goe to heauen, let fore-warned be fore-armed.

And so vse vvise men, seeing it vnpossible for them to escape death and iudgement, they take godly courage, and with all carefulnes prepare for his comming, and vvhen all this is done, seeing hee is like to be too hard for them in this combat, they in time betake themselues vnto the seruice of the Lord of life and death, vvho vvill not see his seruants at any hand miscarry, and if they beleeue in him, though they were dead, yet should they liue, and whosoeuer liueth and beleeueth in him, shall neuer die, Iohn. 11. 25. 26. for though death (as an armed man) assault them, to the separating of their soules

from the bodies, yet all this shal to them turn to the best; for Death now hauing no further Dominion nor power ouer them, departeth as a dastard curre that hath bit one of his Masters sheepe, yet not slaine it, whereby the sheepheard tendereth it the more: and man thus torne, is not slaine, but dismembred a little, but the sheepheard of our soules will recouer and fully cure it: and in the meane while, the body freed of all fears and troubles, shall be honourably buried, and the Lord of life will see it shall not be awaked, abused, nor miscarry, vntill he awake him vp to life, neuer to die any more; and as for the soule, his Angells shall carry him to Abrahams bofome, and what looseth hee now by this combat, for though he be ouer come of death (as Christ his Lord and Master was) yet he getteth the victory, and by dying, conquereth death; and thus the day of Death is the master day, & iudge of all other dayes, the triall and touch-stone of our life, the last Act of the worlds comedy; for if wee die a godly death, it honoureth all our actions, but

if an euill, then it defameth and deformeth them all, yea the death of the righteous (that is of euery beleeuing and repentant sinner) is a most excellent blessing of God, and brings with it many The benefits by Death. worthy benefits: for,
            1. Death is to vs conuerted into a sweet sleepe, and our bodies shall lye in our graues as in a doulne bedde, freed from all dangers, cares, vexations, and temptations, and is the complement of the mortification of our flesh, and wee now are freed from sinne.

It puts vs in possession of all these benefits that Christ hath purchased for vs, Psal. 126. 5. 6. for so ong as wee are in this world, wee are saued but by hope, Rom. 8. 24, but when we die, we shall fully enioy them: a ioy it was to the Israelites, after their long bondage in Egypt to enter into the land of promise, so to a Prentice to be made free, much more to vs to bee set at the liberty of the sonnes of God in heauen.
            
            6.

to wormes meat, and then to dust and ashes: then the graue is the land of darkenesse and solitarinesse: then death driueth vs out of our vocations, & out of Gods Church, and depriue vs of all worldly comforts, and brings vs to iudgement: all and euery of which are distastefull and fearefull to Gods Saints.
            
               Answ. All this is true, and wee may Answ. thanke Sinne and Sathan for it; for had wee not sinned and yeelded to Satans temptation, Gen. 3. we should not haue tasted of Death nor misery, but Sinne brought Gods curse into the world, and specially this; for the reward of Sinne is Death, and doe we maruell that it (as a cursed shippe is ouer-laden with cursed marchandize) nay, wee all may thanke God it is no worse with vs, yet see Gods mercy wrapped secretly in his heauie curse: for 1. though Death be our implacable enemy, yet is he disarmed and vanquished, and swallowed vp of life, and though bodily death remaines vnto Gods children: for the exercise of their faith, patience, &c. yet all that makes it fearefull or greeuous, are remooued,

preuented, or changed and altered to the better, for none of these can hinder vs from seruing the Lord, and calling vpon our God. 2.

Though we be out of our earthly 5. calling, yet are wee in an higher and more honourable seruice among Gods Angels and Saints in the Church triumphant. 6. And though we be depriued 6. of earthly contentments, yet our exchange is with greater aduantage in heauen. 7.

            The last Vse serues for thankfulnesse to God, for this vnspeakeble mercy to vs, as in all other, so namely in this, that

whereas we all, the sonnes of Adam had violated Gods sacred Law, Gen. 2. 17. and brought death eternall vpon our soules and bodies, Rom. 5. 12. &c. so vnspeakeable was the loue of our heauenly father to vs, that to deliuer vs from this body of Death, he gaue his onely begotten Sonne to suffer Death for vs, and to be made a curse for vs, to redeeme vs from the curse of the Law, Galath. 3. 13. and changed this second eternall Death, to a temporall momentany death, making it now the gate of eternall life, and albeit that so also this temporall death seemeth, and is the greatest and most greeuous and terrible of all temporall plagues and torments, and the strength and end thereof, so that thus yet it is intollerable to all the sonnes of Adam, the Lord heare also, for his sonnes sake mitigateth to vs his Elect, this first death also giueth vs his spirit and grace to pull out by degrees the stings thereof, that it shall not hurt vs no more then a Scorpion that embraceth vs about, the sting beeing pulled out, and withall giueth vs Christian fortitude in this last

combate, to gripe with and ouercome death & the terrors thereof, and which is chiefest of all, not onely sendeth his holy Angels in that agony to comfort vs, and to be about our beds and paths as he did to his owne Sonne, Luk 22. 43. but is with vs himselfe in this troble to comfort and to deliuer vs. Psal. 23. and 41. 3. and often to the greater comfort of such as surviue, filleth our hearts, while we be heare, with ioy & gladnes, and with an vnspeakable heauēly light, and feeling of the very ioyes of heaven, wherby Gods blessed Saints, are in this case, so farre from feares & terrours, that having faithfully and blessedly past, all temptations of Satan, and relikes of sin, which be their afflictions, they as men and woemen rapt to the third heaven, desire, and cry for death pray heartely to be dissolved, and be with their Christ, their Lord and their God, and when death commeth with his last stroake, to finish his worke, then is he most welcome, and most ioyfully receiued, and entertained by them. The Lord heereby, putting a playne difference at this time, betweene

the death of his holy and elect saints, and the reprobates, as Psal. 37. 37. Marke the vpright man, and behold the iust, for the end of that man is peace, &c. and the end of the wicked shall be cut off. The Lords name be glorified euer, for this vnspeakable gift, and all others in Christ, Amen. And so farre as now of our watchfulnes for and against Deaths comming.
            The third kinde of watching, concerneth Sect. 16. The third part. The sense. our preparation against the day of iudgement, and how to be then vvith comfort discharged, and so enioy life euerlasting which depends indeed vpon the other two former watches; for if we during our abode heere, liue godly, and depart hence (well prepared) in the feare and fauour of God, it cannot be but we shall be well prepared for iudgement, which is nothing else but the iust reward, or due punishment in the life to come; for the things acted or committed in the time we liued heere. And this care likewise must be thought vpon in this life, and as our preparation for death: so this for life eternall is a forcible motiue to lead a godly life, and faithfully

to occupie our talents, vntill our Masters returne from receiuing his kingdome, Luke 19. 13. 15. as we see in faithfull and trusty seruants, who in their Masters absence will be carefull to giue the seruants their portions in due season, and themselues to be found well occupied, Luke 12. 42. &c. but if they heare of their Masters returne shortly, they will afresh see that all things be in good order, that they be not blamed in any respect, but if they receiue tidings that hee approacheth, and is at the doores, now they vse a third on-set; oh how now they bestirre them 
                  〈◊〉
                how they sweepe the house (though swept againe & againe before) they make vp the beds, dresse and trimme the chambers, and vvhat not? that so they may be freed from all blame, receiue their Master with ioy, and be of him commended and rewarded. So, though Gods Elect be through the whole course of their liues, and for death also very watchfull, that so they may bee approued of God, (come hee when he please to iudgement) yet if by Gods messengers they bee aduertised

that his comming is by infallible signes at hand; then they prepare and trimme their lamps a fresh, and so vse to the two former, a third more speciall watch, and so a threefold Cable will not bee soone burst, and thrise blessed are those seruants whom their Lord when hee commeth shall find so doing, Luk. 12. 43. which being so, I, out of this third member and sense of my text arise this doctrine.

infixed in our hearts, and then should it not greatly need to call vpon them, once, twice, & thrice to watch, for then euery man would be a Niniuite, Ion. 3. 6. and would at euery temptation remember this counting day, whereas now (alas) no sooner is the thunder-clappe of Gods temporall iudgements past, but with Pharaoh their hearts be hardned, with Israel they repent of reformation, and with hogge and dogge returne to their weltring

The world is wholly drowned in infidelity, Luke 18. 8. and needs must bee conuinced thereof, and drawne to repentance, faith, and new obedience, that wee all may cheerefully meete the Lord in the clouds, and bee saued. 6. The due meditation vpon this day, will enforce vs to contemne the world, and all the vanities thereof: Seeing then they must be fired, and we iudged for abusing them; hee that beleeueth this will soone contemne all present vanities, and hasten to future felicitie, and euer will be thankefull

to God for giuing him this warning, to pul the stings of that day out of his conscience before dooms day come, that so that day bee not terrible vnto him, but a ioyfull wedding day, translating the nature of it, from a day of iudgment, to a day of redemption, & conuerting it from the door of hell to the blessed gate of heauen. 7. This doctrine of the last iudgement, is moreouer in sundry respects profitable: for,
            1. It will stirre vs vp to serue God sincerely, without hypocrisie.
            2. It will cause vs suruay our liues, and iudge our selues, that we be not iudged of the Lord, it will also pull downe our pride, and loath the best thing that will hinder our reckoning in that day.
            3. It will cause vs make no more account of this world, then of an Inne, or baiting-place, and to ioy that wee haue occasion to leaue it, and the vanities thereof.
            4. It is Gods day of redemption, and our yeare of Iubely, to warne vs to enter into the possession prepared for vs before all worlds. Thus of the premises wee see

that this watch appertaineth to all men, and that none must refuse this so necessary a worke.

            2. Gods iustice & mercy calls for this 2. day, to punish the wicked, and crowne the godly.
            3. The Lord sundry times, and after 3. diuers manners forewarned vs heereof; as 1. by pronouncing the sentence of Death, for sinne, before it was committed, Gen. 2. 17. 2. by often repeating the same sentence in the Law, Deutr. 27. 26. 3. by the euidence of euery mans conscience, summoning (as it were) all men to appeare at the day appointed, before the great Iudge of all the world, Ioh. 8. 7. and 1. Iohn 3 20. 21. Rom. 2. 15. 16. 4. by his speciall temporall iudgements, that figure it as vpon the old world, Sodom, Babel, Canaan, &c. 5. by many signes and tokens, fore-running and presaging the same. 6. by deliuering his talents to bee occupied vntill his comming againe, Luk. 19. 12. 7. 7. by the word of God warning all to iudgement.
            4. The ends for which Christ commeth 4. to iudgement, iustifie the same: as 1. for the glory and praise of his Iustice,

for all eternity. 2. inrespect of the compleat fulfilling of Christs three offices, And then shall he deliuer vp the kingdome to his father, when hee hath put downe all power, rule, and authority, 1. Cor. 15. 24. &e. 3. for the crowning of the Elect with immortality in heauen; for hauing abolished Sinne and Death, and reconciled the Elect, hee shall deliuer them to his Father, to be crowned with eternall glory, and shall triumph ouer all his enemies for euer. 4. In respect of men, that euery man may receiue his iust desarts, be they good or euill. 5. for the deliuerance of the creatures from the slauish bondage of corruption, whereunto it is subiect, Rom. 8. 20. 6. meet and right it is that the Lord should bee reuenged vpon Satan and all his complices, for troubling his Elect, and consequently vpon all the world, for persecuting and afflicting any manner of way his holy Church; who now (as the bloud of Abel) cry against their oppressors, Reuel. 6. 9.

            The Doctrine thus proued, it followeth Sect. 18. Vse 1. To confute Atheists. to giue some vses for the edifying of the conscience, whereof the first serues for confutation of all Atheists, Sadduces, Epicures, ignorant Sotts, Mockers,

and whosoeuer besides of that cursed crue and litter, who impudently & desperately deny there shall be any day of iudgement, and therefore without reremorse giue the raines of liberty to all sensuality, and abhominations, Math. 22. 23, and Acts 23. 8. and 1. Cor. 15. 12. Phil. 3. 18. 19. and 2. Pet. 3. 3. 4. The reasons of these foolish-witty sinners be these: the whole world stands of beleeuers and vnbeleeuers; but there is no general iudgment day for neyther of these; for the beleeuer hath life euerlasting, and shall not come to iudgement, but passeth from death to life, Ioh. 5. 24. as for the vnbeleeuer, Tremel. 
               hee is condemned already, Iohn 3. 18. and needs no further iudgement, and therefore there shal be no iudgement at all, for it is needless. I answer. By iudgement is meant sometimes absolution, as Math. 25. 34. other while condemnation, Iohn 5. 24. now God will iudge the iust and the wicked, Eccles. 3. 17. the beleeuer shall not come to the iudgement of condemnatiō, yet shal he come to the iudgement of absolution, Math. 25. 34. 40. 41. they reply: that all men at their seuerall

deaths and departure out of this world, are iudged, and what needs the generall? I answer. That (notwithstanding this particular iudgement, (granted) onely vpon mens soules) there must and shall be a generall Sessions, and that for the aboue recited reasons, as also,
            1. Because in the first particular iudgement, the soule onely is iudged, and the body is interred in the graue, therefore meet it is, that as soule & body honoured or dishonoured God together, both should be paid or pained together, and therefore must both appeare, that day to be iudged according to their workes.
            
            2. The Lord in pronouncing his sentence of absolution, as of condemnation, will be iustified and glorified in the face of all the world.
            3. The Lord will haue this to bee a day of generall triumph ouer sinne and Satan, and there must a day be assigned for it, and therefore are wee to watch for it. Vse 2. Is to vse motiue for instruction to the Saints.
            
            The second Vse serues for instruction for Gods children to bee wise and watchfull, for seeing there must bee a

generall day of iudgement, wee must without delay or procrastinations prepare for it; which (I take) we shall performe the better, if wee vse the few motiues offered to your considerations, to stir vp your hearts for this work, wherof I raise my first motiue from the very Sect. 19. The first Motiue frō the names of that day. names and attributes of that fearefull day, for the names in part shew the nature thereof, whereof some be fearefull to rouse the sleepy sluggard, others comfortable, to encourage forward the godly, and both in time to regard their saluation, as
            1. This day is called, the day of iudgement, Math. 12. 36. Luk. 10. 14. and who knoweth not, that to iudge, meaneth properly to doe iustice vpon malefactors; for it is contrary to the name of sauing, deliuering, or redeeming, Ioh. 12. 47. 48. and therefore thereby is meant a day of damnation, which implyeth thus much; that in that day Christ the Iudge will bee so offended with his enemies, that hee himselfe will sit in iudgement vpon them to condemn them to hell; & we know that Monarchs sit not in iudgment

for toyes, (howsoeuer reprobates make but a sport of sin, Pro. 4. 19.) though they tread vnder foot, the very bloud of Christ the Iudge himselfe.
            
            2. It is called a snare, Luk. 21. 35. because, as birds when they fare best & misdoubt no danger, are vnawares caught in a snare; so when the wicked are most secure, this day (as a snare) entrappeth them: and therefore good were it for them not to sleep in sin, nor feed on euery bait, lest being circumvented by Satans snares, they cannot flie to the heauens, Psal. 124. 6.
            3. It is called (as an appellatiue proper) that day, Luk. 21. 34. that is, a day of note, known to babes & children, from their cradles, to fright them from sinne, at the name of which day Satan trembles, infalix felix quaketh, Balthasar sinketh, the rich weepe and howle, & all workers of iniquity are quite confounded.
            
            4. It is named a great day, Reuelat. 6. 17. and 16. 14. because the great God that day will doe great workes, and determine of great matters, of the life and death of men and Angels, and

great is it, in that it includes in it the workes of all ages.
            5. A day it is of Anger & Wrath, Rom. 2. 5. Reu. 6. 17. for then all shall drinke the cup of Gods wrath, that formerly haue prouoked his wrath against them; for hee will poure vpon them his wrath, in flouds of indignation, and streames of anger, Psalm. 11. 7. and 50. 1. 2. 3. in such exceeding measure, as no witte can conceiue.
            6. It is called the day of the Lord, 1. Thes. 5. 2. and 2. Pet. 3. 10. 12. and the day of Christ, 2. Thes. 2. 2. and the day of God, 2. Pet. 3. 12. thereby insinuating, that all other daies were the daies of men, wherin they did what pleased them; and this while the Lord was silent, Psal. 50. 21. but this is Gods day wherein he will speake, and thou shalt be silent: so there be but two daies of all the world, thy day, and Gods day. Now in this thy day, thou (as Lord of all) dost what pleaseth thee, to anger the Lord withall; but in that day, hee will breake silence, of so many daies and yeeres, of so many iniuries and indignities done to him and his, and

will answer for his honor and glory, and then shew himselfe to bee God of Gods, and Lord of Lords: and as man in this his day, did all things heere below out of order, to Gods great dishonour; so the Lord in that day will reduce them all to thir owne order, to mans confusion, and as it is greater sorrow, paine, and greefe to put an arme, once out of ioynt, in his right place againe, then it was at first to put it out; so shall the wicked finde this cure, this day more sharper and bitterer then the putting of it out of ioynt was in their day, and it is well; for as wee see when Rebels and Traitors bee imprisoned, the land is quiet, and the Prince secure; so when these rebels be cast into hell, then is God vniuersally glorified, and the Church secured: and as there was a time when Christ wept, Luke 10. 41. and thou didst laugh, so in this day thou shalt weepe and howle, and hee will laugh at thy destruction, Prou. 1. 26.
            7. It is called the day of the declaration of the iust iudgement of God, according to the Gospell, Rom. 2. 5. 16. signifying, that howsoeuer, now matters

be out-faced, and the verity of the. Gospell contradicted, and that worldlings make no conscience of sacriledge, violence and oppression, and the impotent fatherlesse stranger, & widdow, appeale (being wronged) vnto Christ the iust Iudge, Psal. 26. 1. to be iudge betweene them & their enemies that molest them, and yet now this appellation is not regarded, yet in this day God will declare who haue right, who doth wrong, and will bee reuenged vpon the workers of iniquity, and highly reward the wronged, for he is mercifull.
            8. It is called the day of refreshing, Acts 3. 19. wee see how heere the godly are persecuted, afflicted, and of all men most miserable, but in that day they shal be comforted and refreshed, and haue all teares wiped from their eyes.
            
            9. It is called the day of redemption, Luke 21. 28. Rom. 8. for then all the Elect shall be sure to receiue the effects and fruits of their former redemption purchased them, by the death of Christ, and therfore are the godly with ioyfull hearts to watch and wish his comming,

and the wicked in time to prepare their lamps: And so farre of this first motiue and appellations of this day.

                   the signes of his comming. for Ohrists comming is, that the signes of his approaching are fulfilled by the iudgement of the learned, these signes be of three sorts: some long agoe fulfilled, others more neere at hand, & some to bee fulfilled at his comming: of the first sort, are the preaching of the Gospell, through the world, Math. 24. 14. Rom. 10. 18. and 2. the reuealing of Antichrist, 2. Thes. 2. 3. of the second are the departing of most from the faith, Luke 18. 8. and 2. Thes. 3. 2. and secondly, terrible and grieuous calamities; Math. 24. 6. 16. thirdly, deadnesse of heart, with secure sleeping in sinne, Math. 24. 37. and 25. 6. to 13. 31. Luke 17. 24. &c. as in the dayes of Noah and Lot, fourthly, the calling of the Iewes, Rom. 11. 25. fiftly, many false Christs and false Prophets and seducers: sixtly warres and persecutions: of the last and third sort are the signes in the Sunne and Moone and starres, Math. 24. 29. and the signe of the Sonne of man comming in the clouds, of

which signes further to consider, I refer to euery godly mans priuate meditation, Vse. and as he acknowledgeth them fulfilled, so to prepare himselfe, and where he doubteth of any of these first eight, to conferre with the godly learned, and not harden his heart, but euer be thankfull to our good God, who in mercy giueth vs these signes of his most gracious and glorious comming, least wee should be taken vnprouided: as when a mighty Similie. Monarche, to represse the rebellion of his treacherous subiects, intendeth a Parliament, and sendeth forth his messengers, with proclamations, throughout the Empire, to summon and admonish all estates vpon paine of death, personally to appeare at the appointed day and place: so the father of mercies, by determinate and fore-told signes, summoneth all the world against that appointed day, to appeare before his glorious tribunall, to render a strict account of their liues, since the first creation, to that day, and to receiue their rewards accordingly, good or euill: and for their further instruction in the premises, it

pleaseth his Maiesty to sort his signes, so as they may be liuely vocall preachers, to direct them in the nature of the thing they signifie, and that heereby men may prognosticate without a teacher, not onely the nighnesse of this great Assises, but also the greatnesse and dreadfulnesse thereof, and so at no hand be taken sleepy or vnfurnished: and so farre of the second motiue.

vs when we lesse would, euen as a theefe in the night, while people are asleepe in sinne, and that suddenly too, that the foolish virgins haue no time to trim their lamps, nor the Pharisee to say his long loud prayers, nor the Sadducie to recount his errour in denying the resurrection and iudgement, nor the hypocrite to repent of his dissembling, nor the Atheist Epicure, worldling, swaggerer and swearer, once to cry God for mercie, but now in poste-haste, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the trumpet, appeare they must, bee they ready or vnready, a sharpe and short warning (God wots) to such as neuer thought of any such businesse; this suddennesse is to the wicked, the very doore and beginning of hell, oh happy might they be, if now they might trudge directly to damnation, and not see the Iudges face, whom they buffeted, and whose blessed body they sundry waies pierced! oh that they might now hide themselues in the dens, and in the rockes of the hills, or that hils and rockes would fall vpon them, and hide them from the face of him that sitteth on the

throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe, for the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to endure, Reu. 6. 15. 16. 17. Oh how suddenly doth this trouble & heauinesse fall vpon them as a storme, and their misery like a tempest, Prou. 1. 27. Oh what vnexpected speediness is this, that he hasteneth ere they had space to point at him with the finger, and say, Lo there he commeth; alas, alas, what shift can they make in this narrow strait? how shall they answer, there so many inditements? but they should know, that they formerly had sufficient warning, by Henoch, by Moses, by the Prophets, by the Iudge himselfe, and his Apostles and Ministers in all ages, by iudgements temporal, as afflictions, sicknesses, signes and wonders, death, and all the messengers thereof, but then they despised & scorned all, Prou. 1. 24. Isai. 65. 2. and to despise holy admonition, is to despise him that in loue sendeth him the vvarning; which how heauy a practise it is, appeareth by Gods heauy iudgement vpon Balthasar, who made no vse of Gods iudgement vpon his Father, and

If a theefe should foretell that hee one night or other (he wist not when) would come to rifle and robbe their houses, they would

watch, well appointed euery night, yet that losse would be nothing comparable to this. Let them then know, that as nothing better expelleth sloth, then the certainety of dangers imminent (as is this of Gods comming to iudgement) so nothing moueth watchfulnesse▪ sooner then the vncertainety of the time, when these dangers shall come.

To a lightning, Luke. 17. 24. then which nothing is lesse expected, nothing more sodaine, more fearefull, nor yet more hurtful; none can preuent it before it commeth, and after commonly ensueth a fearefull thunder-clappe; so this great

day, comming vnexpected can by no power of man be stopped, and beeing come, after followes the frightful thunder-clap of Gods eternall curse against reprobates. 4. It is like to a snare, Luke 21. 35. because as birds, when they lesse doubt, are sodainly snared and stifeled; so the wicked when they be most secure in their excesse, and ruffe of security, (as Nabal in his feast, Balthasar in his sumptuous b

Thes. 5. 23. which be she Lady, Queen, or Empresse, shee shall not scape her labour, nor delay one day nor houre, but must yeeld and bow thereto, as well as the basest beggar, and so must all yeeld to this summons: no friend, no worldly treasure, no intreaty will exempt, only due watchfulnesse will secure them.
            
               Obiect. But (alas) if it come thus suddenly, Obiect. who possible can prepare him for it? Many things are to be performed at that very instant, as to pray his Maiesty not to enter into iudgement vvith vs; now to remember his gracious couenant,

and promises made to vs, and now to giue vs his spirit to comfort vs, his Angels to guide and helpe vs, and himselfe to strengthen vs: but this suddennesse excludes all. I answer. Salomon telleth vs of foure impossibilities, yet by watchfulnesse performed; as 1. to know the way of an Eagle in the ayre, of a Serpent vpon a stone, of a shippe in the sea, and of a man with a maid, P

Methinkes I see in my minde what concourse and suite would of all the world bee made vnto them, not to desire wisedome nor children, nor any temporal boone; but that there should be no day of iudgement to as many as at a reasonable rate & price would buy it at Iudas hand, euery man according to their ability: and as for kingdomes, riches, honour, and glory, hee should not bee to seeke; for Herod would giue Master Iudas the halfe of his kingdome, to liue securely with Herodias: Balthasar would make him third Ruler in the kingdome, cloath him with purple, and put a chaine of gold about his necke, to deliuer him from the hand-writing vpon the wall: and Felix to deliuer him from this feare of that day, would shew him no small friendship, Esau to pleasure him would sell his birth-right; Satan the God of the world would giue him all the kingdōes of the world, and the glory of them, to secure him from this day: nay, who would not make a purse for this collection and contribution, yea crouch and kneele too

to master Iudas, to buy this immunity, no pardon to this, neuer was heauen so little regarded, nor immortality at a lower price, nor God himselfe, as now when most men are content to forfeit heauen, and depriue themselues of all the good things of God, and withall to giue to the most accursed of men (euen to the Deuill Iudas) masses of gold and siluer, which they would neuer do to the poore members of Christ, to procure this cursed pardon; and now Iudas fault is, that he is not couetous enough, oh, that hee would for this pardon aske aboundantly, gold, pearles, iewels, and what not; and hee should haue it vvith thankes, though they themselues liued beggers euer after; for now the couetous Iudge would poure out his bribes, the deceitfull Counsellors his Angells, the double-faced Atturney his double fees; the Oppressors and Sacriledgers, their ill gotten goods & spoyls of Gods Church; the crafts-men their cousening money; the Physitions their spoyles of the sicke; the Vsurers their bagges, the inordinate liuers, as hunters, faulkners,

mourned & sorrowed of all Gods elect; for goe through the whole world & enquire of this point, wishing euery man, as in the sight of God, to declare his Conscience, and (if they doubt not) you shall finde, that not onely malefactors, but infinite swarmes of Professors are of this minde (if wishing would preuaile them) that there should bee no day of iudgement, for howsoeuer in their troubles they desire to be dissolued, and be with Christ, yet as weomen great with childe Similie. desire they were deliuered; but vvhen their houre commeth, they cry out and wish it were further off. So when the time of their dissolution approacheth, they abhorre death and iudgement, which noteth they haue not yet learned to die, nor prepared for iudgement, but with that hypocrite in Micha 6. 6. Would bow, and bribe the Lord with burnt offerings, and calues of a yeere old, with thousand of Rammes, and ten thousand riuers of Oyle, and giue his first-borne for his transgression, and the fruit of his body for the sin of his soule, which plainely conuinceth that there is no faith vpon the earth,

This is the case of all men almost, that they would giue any thing that there should bee no day of iudgement, and that because their consciences tell them, that the day of iudgement is their very day of execution: and therefore to escape this day, regard not though they depriue all Gods Elect from heauen, yea God himselfe from his honor and glory, Christ Iesus from his body mysticall, the Church and themselues be transformed to beasts, in body and soule dying together.

But yet, because thou shalt not depart comfortlesse from me, I will shew thee a

ready & easie way to procure the Lords fauour, that there shall bee no day of Means that there shall be no day of iudgement. iudgement for thee; that is, that thou be not damned with the wicked, neuer runne to Balaam nor Iudas, for they are out of fauour now with the Iudge, and cannot helpe themselues: nor yet to any Angell nor Saint, for they haue oyle little enough for themselues, and when they haue done all, they are vnprofitable seruants; but doe thou (following the Iudges aduise in Luke 14. 31.) distrusting thy weakenesse and disability before-hand appease his wrath with these holy subtilties.
            First, let vs (thou and I) examine our soules thorowly, and suruay our whole liues, then speedily from our harts confesse and repent vs of our former vnreformed liues, and vpon the knees of our hearts (with the Publican) cry mightily for pardon and peace at the Iudges feet, and he is mercifull and ready to forgiue, and iudging our selues we shall not be iudged of the Lord.
            
            Secondly, then by a sted fast faith, let vs apprehend Christs merits, and vvee

shall not miscarry, for hee neuer failed any true beleeuer.
            Thirdly, let vs reforme our liues, and walke before him in new obedience, without halting or looking backe, and shew our faith by our workes, and the money which we vvould so prodigally bestow vpon Iudas for this supposed pardon, let vs bestow it totally vpon Christ himselfe in his poore members, and hee will reward it in the day of iudgement with eternall life, Math. 25. 34. 35. 36.
            Fourthly, Watch in Prayer, and continue in well doing for Christs comming to iudgement; and whereas thou fearest and abhorrest the day of Death and Iudgement, acquaint thy selfe with God and with it daily, by degrees and holy meditation: and as a man that carrieth Similie. an ouer-heauy burden doth lighten it by pulling out the stickes one by one, so endeuour thou daily to lessen and pull out thy sinnes, and then thou shalt not need to feare that day, if so be also (as thou forsakest thy sinnes) thou haue a care to grow in grace and fauour with the Iudge: and as Fencers which

are to play the Prizes of Triall, doe daily try their strength and exercise their A Similie. weapons, bending their whole mindes how they may best foyle their enemie, that when the day commeth, they may haue honour and triumph: so ought we to doe, (for whom a greater reward without comparison is layed vp) if vvee will die well, and appeare vpright in iudgement; but if otherwise it come to passe, wee shall bee punished with vnspeakeable shame and reproach: and this our meditation of iudgement shall be handled in no other order then the same our death and departure bringeth with it: For as they which are to runne A Similie. a race doe oftentimes leade their horses vp and downe the running place, that they may see and be the better acquainted with the stones and vn-euen places, and other impediments in the same, that when the day commeth, they may finish the race without stay or stoppe: so vvee (which must measure the pace and race of Death and Iudgement whether vvee will or no) shall doe very well, if now in our minde & meditation wee frame this

race, and diligently consider all things which are in the same; specially seeing the way is obscure and perillous, and many for want of this consideration miscarry. This doe now, and thou needest not then feare to appeare in iudgement.
            The Vse serues for comfort to the Elect, Vse. that albeit the reprobates arise, and against their wills (as beares to a stake, or fellons to the barre) are haled to iudgement, for greater increase of their sorrowes, yet this shall be an exceeding ioy to the faithfull, that they are sent for to appeare before their heauenly Father, who is to be their Iudge, & wh

Corin. 13. 12. though not absolutely, wherof the Angels are vncapable, he being incomprehensible; but as a man standing vpon the shore of the Sea, seeth the Sea perfectly, & yet seeth not the depth nor bredth ofit; so the Elect shall see God, yet not comprehend the depth of his greatnes, nor bredth of his power, nor height of his Essence, Maiesty, and glory: Then

we shall see and know one another, the King his subiects, the Pastor his people, the Parents their children, the Husband his Wife, the Master his seruants, and they them; and if they bee good, be thankefull to God for them; if bad, thanke God for pardoning their sinnes if they be saued; if damned, iustifying and praysing God for executing his iust The Reasons. iudgement vpon them.

This is so plaine in Nature, that the very heathen thought this to bee a great benefit, that men, specially vvise men, had by death, that their knowledge,

should be perfected in the other world, and that none could possibly attaine to perfect wisedome & knowledge till he came thither, and as for that Pythagoricall fancie, that men by washing in the Riuer Lethe, forg

                  t all they formerly did, It is a plaine fiction, more to be derided then confuted; and Plato in his Apology of Socrates, relateth how Socrates being condemned by the Iudges, reioyced, that if the soules were immortall, then should hee see the famous men that liued before him. And Tully in his first booke of Tusculus questions, brings this as an argument not to feare, but desire death: and Tertullian, lib. ad Martyr, saith, That the Martyrs shall iudge their Iudges, which they could not, if they knew them not.
            5. Christ our Sauiour will know vs, and call vs to himselfe, Come ye blessed of my Father, &c. and they shall see their desire vpon their enemies, according to their prayer in Reuelat. 6. 10. Now considering the premises, what childe of God would desire there should be no day of iudgement, or would seeke a place to

hide himselfe, or giue a penny to buy a pardon, to exempt him from appearing, and for euer lose God, heauen, & all the company of heauen, and communion of Saints, & not wish this day; and giue all vvorldly treasures, that this day might be hastened, and vncessantly cry, and pray, Come Lord Iesu, come quickly: for now such as sowed in teares, shall reape in ioy, and haue all teares wiped from their eyes, and liue in perpetuall ioy, and their reioycings shall no man take from them, nor euer end.
            Secondly, knowing these things before hand, this should be a faire warning Vse 2. for good and badde to acquaint themselues now with the Iudge, and labour for grace, that being well prepared, and their Talents wel imployed, they might be sure of the Iudges acceptance, and the fauor and comfort of all his Saints.

So we read in Math. 25. 31. When the Sonne of Man shall come in his glory, & all the holy Angells with him, then shall hee sit vpon the throne of his glory, &c, The day was, when he (poore man, meek as a Lambe) stood before the iudgement seat of Pontius Pilate, proudly vaunting that hee had power to crucifie or loose him, Ioh. 19. 10. but in this day Pilate and all Potentates must stand and stoope before his foote-stoole to be iudged, and shall know, that hee onely hath all power in his hand, to saue and condemne.
            The vse we are to make heereof, is to The Vse. giue the Lord, now all honour and glory, and to kisse the Sunne least h

            Then secondly, we are to obserue the mystery of this, that is said in Math. 24. 30. Hee shall come in the clouds of 
                     •
                  eauen, with power and great glory: which is to humble and to teach vs, that if wee will hereafter ioyfully behold him comming

in the clouds, we must thankefully and gladly receiue and intertaine him now comming vnto vs in the clouds of his holy Preachers, who instill the gracious deaw of his Gospell into our soules.
            Then thirdly, consider further in what blessed estate his Angels stand in, vvho shal accompany the Lord to iudgement, and most ioyfully and securely behould his glory, and now together with all the Saints of God, receiue the fulnesse of all felicity, (all enemies troden vnder feet) and if thou couldst wish then thy selfe to be one of his number, and not of Satans damned rabblement, then now labour for holinesse and true righteousnesse, that thou mayest then bee numbred amongst the Sonnes of God: then contrarily marke in what a miserable taking shall these accursed wretches be, in that they scorned, were ashamed of, and crucified our Sauiour to death, reuiled and persecuted his word and ministers, flouted them and their appeales, against the sentences, cruelty, and vniustly denounced against them, which now shall be fauourably heard, and they seuerally

plagued, so that to their cost anon they shall know how the Lord will take part with the Lambes against those sauage Lyons, let them then become now such as then faine they would bee found and reputed. And thus farre of the sixt motiue.
            The seuenth Motiue, concerneth the The seuenth Motiue. The place where the Iudgement shall be. place where the Iudgement shall bee, which is euidently expressed, but guessed diuersly of diuers men: when our Sauiour was demanded this question in Luke 17. 37. Math. 24. 48. hee answered prouerbially, yet doubtfully, thus; Wheresoeuer the body is, thither will also the

with the eyes of Faith looke vnto him, and by the direction of his spirit, smell (by the afore-going signes) that his comming is at hand, and so prepare themselues to meete him, who is both the food of their soules, and their onely protector. This is all our Sauiour speaks of the place, but others laboured to find the place, to wit vpon earth, euen in the valley of Iehosaphat, abusing Ioel 3. 2. 12. where he speaketh of the restitution of the Church, and the iudging of the enemies thereof: and least men should thinke this vnpossible, hee alludeth to that great victory mentioned in 2. Chro. 20. 22. (and it had need bee a large valley that should comprehend all the world) S. Paul saith; Then shall we which liue and remaine, bee caught vp with them

Luk. 12. 20. for (to our sorrow) we see that the whole care of most men is so fixed and setled vpon this life, that they neuer take comfort (but feare rather) of meeting the Lord in the ayre, nor neuer mention the day of iudgement, vnlesse it be in swearing, as God shall iudge their soules, &c. as if they had beene set in the world, but to learne to blaspheme, sweare, & curse themselues; whereas the while their meditations should run vpon this point; how they might most ioyfully and best prepared meet the Lord in iudgement. But these Mammonists (as watch) so turmoyle

themselues vpon this earth, that they cannot spare any time to looke vp for the Lords comming to iudgement; and are like to Husbandmen manuring their ground all the yecre, but forgetting to sowe, so they labour for life, but forget death and piety, and so loose all the haruest croppe; and which is the more to bee lamented, these bee not the fewest number of men, for sinne and sinners neuer more then in these dayes since the light of the Gospell abounded. If an Asse or Oxe fall into a pit, all men vvill lift them vp; but if mans soule (then which nothing is more precious) perish, Plurima pessima presiosa non vniuersa. no man regardeth it; The wise man could say, that the most men are the worst men, and that good men are odde men, waspes and hornets swarme, but few painefull bees that gather the sweet hony from the flowers of Gods word, for the winter of eternall life, treasuring vp the combes of faith and good workes in the hiues of their harts: Aske the earth, & it will tell thee, that it affordeth more matter for base pots, then ockre for gold: aske the Gardiner, and hee will

answer, that he hath more Nettles then Roses, weedes then flowres; aske the Traueller, and hee will shew thee, that many tread the broad, but few the narrow way. And finally, aske thine own conscience, and it will certifie thee, that it hath a large Catalogue of dead works, but scarce one good thought, worde, or worke; and is it maruell they cannot looke once towards the place our Sauiour commeth to iudgement.

                     〈◊〉
                  . For terror to cōmers vnprepared wicked, who when they come to this place vnprepared, full of their sinns and vncleannesse, with guilty consciences and more heauy hearts and countenances, where will they stand then, seeing as Psal. 1. 5. The wicked shall no
                     •
                   stand in iudgement, nor the sinners in the assembly of the righteous, &c. and the Iudge will be then so far from shewing them mercy, that they shall not bee permitted to stand vpon the same ground, as the Elect doe. A time there was, that when they came in place, all the company would giue them the hand, the best and highest roomes, and would be glad that

they would accept of their company, but now Harlots and Lazats are magninified, and they placed among reprobates, and the worst people liuing: doth the Iust now heed what he doth, in displacing Gentlemen, and men of great worth, and placing poore and base fellowes aboue them? this is iust Salomons Censurer, who saw seruants on herses, & Princes walking as seruants on the ground, Eccles 10 7. Oh this, dealing at the first appearance is enough to kill a proud heart! and yet there is no hope to helpe it; for now thy Sunne sets at Noone, Amos 8. 9. and thy light is cleane put out, Ezech. 32. 7. &c. and thou must trudge hence to vtter darkenesse, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth, insomuch as what way soeuer thou cast thine eyes, there is nothing but increase of sorrow, and of infinite perplexities of heart, and happy wert thou now if thou mightest still abide and build thee heere a tabernacle, but it will not be; for hee that shewed no fauor nor mercy to Christs members shall now finde none of Christ, and hee that scorned and disdained the Church

militant, shall finde no community with No help any where for the wicked. the Church triumphant, but be debarred from all comforts; for if thou looke to the bounty of God for one droppe of water, now the well-springs of mercy are locked and dried vp, and remember how thou hadst comfort, and Lazarns pain. If to Gods iustice, thou canst not answer him one to a thousand. If to his mercy, thou refusedst it offered thee, this is a day of Iustice. If for delay, thou hast delayed ouer-long, and the abusing of thy time crieth for vengeance; for hitherto time and tide hath beene at thy becke & thou regardest it not, and now Gods turne commeth, who will not regard thee. If to the world, behold, it is all on fire, and that for thy sinnes that defiled it. If to thy kindred and friends, all obligations of naturall affections cease, and they are zealous for Gods glory. If to wife and children, they are (for husbands and parents impiety) separated from God, and stand in the same transgression. If to thy Minister, he it is whom thou hast euer hated, robbed, persecuted, and which is another vexation, hee

shall anon sit in iudgement vpon thee. If to the Saints, they haue not oyle enough for themselues. If to thine own good workes, they as smoake vanish, being all done in hypocrisie, and for vaine-glory, and from an vnregenerate heart. If to thy former life, behold a blacke cloud of trecherous inditements against thee. If to Satan thy suggester, he now stands in the like condemnation. If to the Angells, they are the haruest-men sent to gather the tares, and to cast them into the fiery furnace. If to the Iudge himselfe, he calls thee to surrender thy talents and stewardship. If to carnall shifts and helpes, the Iudge will not be corrupted with bribes, nor mooued with flattery, nor deluded any longer with promises, nor terrified with threats, nor touched with pitty; thy threats will not bee respected, wringing of hands, pulling of hayre, tearing of thy flesh, weeping, howling, and endlesse lamenting will not be regarded, praiers be but babling, vowes past date, no truce, no sureties, no appeale, no repriuing, no delay, no repentance; a wicked life calleth for iustice,

sin, for death; contempt of God, for finall damnation: turne thee what way thou wilt, there is no cōfort, euery creature proclaims that the mighty must be mightily tormented; and woe is to the wicked, for now it shall goe euill vvith him; for the reward of his hands shall bee giuen him: What shalt thou doe? looke vp to heauen, it is shut against thee, to the Iudge hee commeth to denounce the sentence: vnder thy feete hell gapeth for thee, within thee is a condemning conscience, without thee, the bookes opened, about thee, the reprobates mourning; to goe forward is vnpossible, to goe backward is not permitted, to stand still thou canst not, to runne away is bootlesse, no remedy, but miserably to sustaine and vndergoe all torments and extremities of this fearefull day and place, vnlesse now thou repent, ioyne with Gods Church, forsake thy former wickednesse, and that thou maist die the death of the iust, liue the life of the godly: and if thou vvilt haue a wished place in iudgement, and after in heauen with Gods Elect, get thee

a place heere vpon earth with Gods Church, bee not now separated from them in the exercises of religion, and holy communion of Saints, and thou shalt not be diuided from them, in the enioyments of the fruits thereof; both in death, iudgement, and glory eternall in heauen; for looke what place and profession thou choosest heere now among the godly or wicked, and the like place shalt thou find with the like company in iudgement, and euer after: Behold, I set before thee life, and death, good and euill, &c. as in Deut. 30. 15. to the end: And thus farre of the second Motiue.

                  ing. is, the consideration of the glorious comming of the Son of God to iudgement, immediately after the whole world is assembled to the appointed place: but so, that first two euident signes shall goe before, the one immediately before his comming, or (as I may say) at his setting forth, which is this.
            1. There shall be signes in the Sun, &c. as in Luk. 21. 25. The Sea and the Waters shall rore, and mens hearts shall faile in them

for feare, for the powers of Heauen shall be shaken, Luke 21. 25. 26. As for the signes in the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, Math. 24. 29. saith they shall be darkened, (that is to say, as the learned expound it) Christs comming vnto iudgement shall be with such resplendant and vnspeakeable glory, that euen the most excellent creatures shall bee thereat astonied, so that the Sunne and Moone shall bee darkened, and the starres, (as if they fell from heauen) giue no light; that is, these most glorious and bright-shining creatures, shall be clouded, obscured, and damped by the vnconceiuable brightnesse of Christs comming to iudgement, whereat the wicked shall despaire for feare, as Reuel. 6. 12. to the end, (which place is an euident fore-running figure hereof, as that also in Exod. 19. 16. to 20.) Then (the sea and waters shall for feare roare) least now they shall bee turned to nothing: such as dwell by the Sea side, obserue, that against tempestuous weather the Sea roareth; but this being a most fearefull day in respect of Gods inquisition for sinne and sinners, and all other

accessaries therevnto, and no storme to the tempest of Gods wrath, they not onely roare, but as it were set out their feare, with all the strength and power they can, that so the Lord might respect and preserue the miserable sencelesse creatures, abused by mans sinfulnesse, and the powers of heauen shall be shaken as threatning a downefall, by reason of mans sinne, and the Lords indignation, and punishing of all sinners. As Similie. when the Father of a family punisheth and whippeth in his anger any one of the seruants, all the house, as the very children and seruants will feare, and so is it heere when the Lord in his vvrath commeth to punish all workers of iniquity, the Angells, the Heauens, and Saints of God, all subiect, and guilty of their infirmities, compared vvith Gods holinesse and perfection, cannot but tremble and quake (as we read the Prophets did in all their visions) much more in this. So likewise when the Master Similie. of a great family dieth, the whole house is troubled, the wife taketh on, the children weep, the seruants lament,

the retainers mourne, the house is turned vpside-downe, hospitality giuen ouer, and all come to ruine, and desolation: so heere, when man (the center and glory of this world) draweth to his end and triall, and is like to bee vtterly confounded in hell fire. Oh Lord! What shall become, or to vvhat vse serues this world, the heauens, the earth, the sea, and all the powers thereof? but vvith man to be turned to nothing, or set vpon a light fire, to bee consumed to dust and ashes, (if the Lord in mercy do not otherwise determine and dispose of them) and is it any maruell that they tremble, quake, and roare for feare, and how much-more should man, the cause hereof (seeing and knowing all these things) tremble, weepe and howle for his sinnes, now while time serueth, and he may be heard but in these great water-flouds of misery, they shall not come nigh him, nor be heard. Wee see that onely an earth-quake, if it bee any thing vehement, is exceeding fearefull, & the least extraordinary inundation of waters very terrible, but now when the vvhole

massie globe of this world shal thus totter and shake; the mightiest seas and waters rore and rage for feare, and the glorious heauens become darke and dusky, how shall the hearts of men be appalled with dread and terror to behold the same, and the cause thereof? wise men preuent dangerous diseases, lest they take away their colour, and kill them; how much more should we here by the diet of sanctification so preuent Gods iudgements, that wee may expect them cheerefully, and be nothing agast, and escape this terror; for no earthquake to this shaking, no thunderclap to this noyse and fright.
            The second signe is ioyned with his The world shall be fired. most glorious comming, which is (in deluge wise) the firing of the whole world, so that it shall appeare no more, till it be renewed, (according to these quotations, Psalm. 50. 1. 2. 3. and 97. 3. 4. and 102. 26. Isa. 66. 15. 16. 22. Dan. 7. 10. and 2. Thes. 1. 7. 8. and 2. Pet. 3. 10. 11. 12. 13. Reuel. 20. 12. and 21. 1. Math. 24. 35. Rom. 8. 21. Heb. 1. 10. this fire shall (as a lightning before a thunder) goe before

his presence (as Exod. 19. 18.) and this the learned take to bee the signe of the Sonne of Man in Heauen, that is, when this terrible fire shall flash before his presence, then all men expect his appearing: Mat. 24. 30 which fire, though it fill the world, yet shall it not consume, but purifie it, and cause it shine more glorious (as gold the corruption consumed, as Rom. 8. 20.) as at the first creation, to receiue his Lords comming to iudgment, and so it shall appeare, as a new Heauen, and as a new earth, Isa. 65. 17. and 66. 22. and 2. Pet. 3. 7. 10. 13. Reuel. 21. 1. and this sight shall bee exceeding terrible to the wicked; for now, they see what manner of one the Lord is, (which before they would neuer beleeue) euen a consuming fire, Deutr. 4. 24. Heb. 12. 9. and now againe are the words of Isai chap. 33. 14. 15. &c. forefiguring this day verified. The si

                  ouring fire, who among vs shall dwell with the euerlasting burning? Hee that walketh in iustice, and speaketh righteous things, refusing gaine of

oppression, shaking his hands from taking of gifts, stopping his eares from hearing of bloud, and shutting his eyes from seeing euill, &c. which things because formerly they did not, now this fire shall ceaze also vpon them, as the beginning of their sorrow, and a taste of Gods fiery wrath, and burning displeasure. But to proceed further in this hote subiect, I cannot, nor list not, neither is it needfull. Only let the terriblenesse hereof, now whiles time serueth, moue vs to due and careful watchfulnes and preparation, that then Vse to watch against this fire. this fire, nor any other, annoy vs not, no more then Daniels companions were in the fiery Ouen, but rather that we euer labour to be filled with the heauenly fire Dan. 3. 19. of Gods loue and spirit, which will consume, coole, and quench all other fires whatsoeuer.
            The ninth Motiue to watchfulnesse, is Christs sitting in iudgement, vpon The ninth Motiue. Christs sitting in iudgement vpon the throne of his glory. both Elect and Reprobate; for thus we read, For when the Sonne of Man commeth in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall hee sit vpon the throne of his glory, Math. 25. 31. whereby it seemeth

that a throne of Estate shall be set for his Maiesty, and the rather, because in Mat. 19. 28. the Apostles are said, that they shall sit also vpon twelue thrones, and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel: but what manner of Throne this shall be, wee cannot well define, because wee haue heere nothing but the name thereof (viz. the throne of his glory) and therefore vvee are not to be ouer-curious heerein, but suspend our iudgements, rather then to imagine any particular likenesse of the maiesty hereof in our mindes, till in due season wee shall ioyfully behold it vvith our eyes: but sure wee are that it is a throne of glory, because it is mentioned in so many places (as in Dan. 7. 9. 10. Psal. 9. 4. Math. 25. 31. Reuel. 4. 1. 4. and 3. 21. and 6. 16. and 20. 11.) albeit I deny not, but that many things heere spoken, are deliuered in figure, according to mans capacity, and proportionable to the manner of worldly Monarchs & Kings; who, when they shew themselues to their subiects in their Royall Maiesty, and doe sit in iudgement, then they vse to ascend to the Thrones of their kingdomes,

and there in all glorious, graue, and solemne, high and magnificent estate shew themselues vnto their people, and such as they iudge: so it is here vndoubtedly, when our Lord and Sauiour Christ Iesus is this day to shew himselfe in most magnificent, triumphant, and glorious manner, before all Princes & Nations of the world; meete it is that he should shew himselfe in the highest degree of his honour, power, and maiesty, and sit vpon the throne of his glory, to iudge all the world, & that in such honourable and dreadfull manner, as all flesh, enemies, and loyall subiects bee enforced to glorifie his holy and blessed name. This throne is figured (in 1. King. 10. 18. 19. 30.) by Salomons throne, which hee made, not onely 
                  Salomons Throne cō
                  pared with Christs, whereof it was a figure. to set out his royalty (for other Kings could haue made the like) but for the vse thereof, which was to signifie vvhat vertues and graces should be in a King and Iudge aboue all other men: and withall to prefigure the excellent graces which should appeare in the Prince of Peace; and Iudge of all the World,

as thus briefly, viz. 1. For the forme Pet. Martyr Mar. 
                     •
                  orchaus in 1. Kin. 10. 18. thereof: It was a great throne, for the great King: so this throne of glory is said to be in Reuel. 20. 11. Iohn saw a great white Throne (and great indeede must that Throne be whereupon sitteth hee who is called the great God, as Tit. 2. 13. Luke 1. 32. and 7. 16.) then it was white, signifying the innocency which should be in a King, and so figuring the glorious and diuine brightness and integrity in the King of glory, Cantic. 5. 14. 2. The matter was yuory and golde, signifying that the Kings hart ought to be simple, innocent, pure, and voyd of all corruption, and Christ herein passeth all Iudges. 3. The Throne had steps to ascend vnto, Gen. 28. 12 13. to signifie that iudgement should be giuen with aduise and deliberation, and not hastily nor rashly, Gen. 11. 5. 6. and 18, 21. and to signifie that hee should excell all other in vertue, as Christ doth. 4. The toppe of the seat was round behinde, to signifie the simplicity and perfection of the Kings harts. 5. The staies or pummels whereon the King leaned, declared that the Kings estate stood

vpon these two stayes; to wit in defending the godly, and punishing the wicked. 6. The Lions noted that hee ought to be strong and couragious in his rule and gouernment, and yet milde and louing, & the footstep was of gold (as 2. Chr. 9. 18.) to signifie that a King should contemne bribes & rewards which blinde Iudges eyes, &c. and all these vertues are foretold and found to be in Christ, as in Isai. 11. 2. to 11. Psal. 45. 6. 7. Luk. 11. 31. Heb. 1. 8. Then moreouer it is called the throne of his glory, because his iudgement shall bee such, as shall redound in all respects, by all people, Reprobates as Elect, to his honour and glory; for hee will so sincerely, vprightly, iustly, yea and mercifully iudge the world, that euen Sathan himselfe, and al Reprobates (how wicked and malicious soeuer they be) cannot chuse but rebound all glory vnto God, and say Righteous art thou O Lord, and iust are thy iudgements, Psalm. 119. 137. though notwithstanding they could wish that the execution of the sentence were reuersed, yet (howsoeuer) they shall confesse that they haue iustice

with fauour, ministred vnto them, farre infinitely aboue their desert, as Fathers vse to their rebellious sonnes, they cast out of their houses, and stone to death, Deutr. 21. 18. &c. So that God shall be glorified by the damnation of the wicked, as by the saluation of the Elect, and then shall be fulfilled that figure in Reu. 5. 11. &c. and 7. 9. &c. Ibeheld, and lo a great multitude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lambe, cloathed with long white robes, and Palmes in their hands, and they cried with a loud voyce, saying, Saluation commeth of our God, that sitteth vpon the throne of the Lambe, and all the Angells which stood round about the throne, &c. fell before the throne vpon their faces, and worshipped God, saying Amen. Praise, and glory, and wisedome, and thankes, and hanor, and power, and might, bee to our God for euermore, Amen. Now the reasons The Reasōs why Christ is said to sit vpon the Throne. why our Sauiour Christ is said to sit vpon the throne of his glory, to iudge the world, are these.
            1. Because God the Father committed

               all iudgement to the Sonne, Iohn 5. 22. 27. Acts 10. 42. and 17. 31. Rom. 14. 10.
            2. Because according to his holy and gracious couenant, he shedde his bloud for all mankinde, which some receiued, and

Meete it is, and right, that hee should iudge such as iudged, and persecuted him, and his Elect, formerly, &c. yet we are to vnderstand that albeit the whole iudgement is committed to Christ; the father and the holy ghost are not excluded simply and altogether, The whole Trinity iudgeth. for this were a diuiding of the vnity of the deity: true it is, Christ shall iudge

his people, but in all respects according to the will and decree of the Father, and the holy Ghost, who shall also sit in the throne, and giue together full assent & consent, authority, power, and approbation therevnto, as at the deliuering of the Law at Sinai, Exo. 20. 1.

Of Christs separating the Elect from the Reprobate. is the manner of Christs proceeding in iudgement: for first, before him shall bee gathered all Nations, (Hee being set vpon the throne of his glory) and he shall separate them one from another, as a Shepheard separateth the sheepe from the goates; and hee shall set the sheep on his right hand, and the goates on the left, Math. 25. 31. 32. 33. Where first note, heere is no producing of Witnesses, nor impanelling of Iuries, because the Iudge himselfe knoweth the very secrets of all hearts, and is perfectly priuy to euery mans waies, according to Reuel. 2. 23. All the Churches shall know that I am hee which search the reynes and hearts, and I will giue vnto euery one of

you, according to your workes. And besides this, euery mans guilty conscience shall be (as a thousand witnesses, and as a booke of inditements and euidences against him) assenting and consenting to this proceeding of his Iudge, Rom. 2. 15. 16. and Iohn 8. 9. 1. Cor. 4. 5. Math. 16. 19. Reuel. 20. 12. and so remaine vpon the file that day: this separation of the wheate from the tares, of the sheepe from the goates, and lambes from the wantonkyddes, is the entrance & beginning of the execution of Gods iudgement vpon the wicked, which how gastfull and distastefull it will be to the diuels themselues, as also to all Reprobates, no heart can conceiue, nor tongue relate. In this life the goatish worldlings lord it, and scorned to be set on the worser hand, but now they are faine to stand below and giue place to their betters, for the Iudge of all the world can easily discerne betweene the precious and the vile, and place eyther of them in their proper rankes: and now Esa. 65. the wretches full of sorrow see how the day is like to goe with them; for the Iudge himselfe many yeeres before told

them vpon which hand the Reprobate should be placed, though they regarded it not, but applied it to others, iudging others for left-handed men, and not themselues, but now the conscience gnaweth, and crieth guilty: formerly they were full of presumed faith and hope, neuer doubting to say they doe it to be thus placed, but now the wretches which they scorned to place vvith their dogges, appeare cheerefully with great boldnesse on the better hand, before the faces of such as tormented Wisd. 5. them, and tooke away their labours; this killeth the proud and haughty heart, and casteth them downe to hell gates; now could they wish they had neuer beene borne, or being borne, had ledde Lazarus life: now with the Leaper they put their hands vpon their heads, and cry, I am vncleane, I am vncleane, Leuit. 13. 45. Now they see all the gates and well-springs of mercy locked, and quite dried vp; now the worme of Conscience (as a greedy Wolfe, Viper, or Vulture) beginneth a-fresh to gnaw their hearts, and will neuer die; and thus before

the Iudge speakes a word, they iudge themselues, who would not doe it, when they were required so to doe, and now they see, and for greefe eate their hearts, and weepe in their soules, that for so momentany shadowes of pleasures and profits, they were so mad as to renounce God, forfeit heauen, sell themselues to hell torments, and dispossesse themselues of eternall blisse, which might easily be attained, if in the time accepted they had accepted thereof: Oh that they might but once againe, but for a little time, return to the world againe! oh, how would they (knowing what they know) repent, fast, pray, yea doe all good workes, specially to Christs brethren, how deepely would they lament their sinnes, reforme their liues, and in all things obay the watch men of their soules, who euer formerly they hated, and whose hearts and soules, of set purpose they vexed & grieued with their drunken abhominations: since the time their soules were separated from their bodies, their case was euer lamontable, yet desired to see this day, in

hope of some comfort, when they receiued their bodies, and when the Lord came to iudgement, but now euery way the case is worse, soule and body must together trudge to hell fire for euer, and who is able to abide that burning: they desired poore wretches, to appear soule & body this day before their iust Iudge, and to come once more to hearing, and to haue their causes more throughly heard and scanned; but (alas) how are they repelled, as vnknowne, and workers of iniquity, Math. 7. 22. 23. Now could they wish that soule and body had neuer come together, but that the body had still rotted in the graue. Alas! now what shall they doe? there is no place to hide them, nor flee vnto for releefe, seeing they haue so hainously prouoked the Lords wrath, while time and tide serued, they regarded it not, now Gods turne commeth with his sword of Iustice to cut them off, and so this day is turned vnto night, woe bee vnto them that euer they sinned.

Now they repent, and euer shall repent, that they no sooner repented, but this repentance is but the feeding of the worm of conscience: now they (though

too late) finde who is the greatest lyar, Michaiah the true, or Zedechiah the false Prophet: the faithfull Preachers, or deceitfull hypocrites: the word of God, or the perswasions of the world: the counsell of the faithfull, or deceifulness of sinne: the warnings of the zealous Ministers, or the damnable wiles of Sathan. But now what remedy, it is too late to be wise, there was a time vvhen Remedies to escape Hell. they might escape hell, but now shall be no time for euermore. Yet to vs that as yet liue there is remedy enough, if vve will accept of the acceptable time, these frights and feares shall not touch vs.
            1. If first, we will euery man betimes watch and wake to God, and seriously with mature, sad deliberation, consider in what a dolefull case mans sinfull soule shall that day stand, and what paines, endlesse, pittilesse, and remedilesse, are ordained for all prouokers of Gods wrath and vengeance, and therefore now let vs preuent his iudgements, embrace his mercies, be thankefull for this timely warnings, and not delay amendment of life.
            
               
2. Consider how hartily thou wouldest wish then, that in this world thou hadst reformed and framed the whole course of thy life, according to Gods reuealed will in all points, and doe so now speedily, and no longer heape to thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath, but yeeld vnto the Lord the honour due vnto his name, Rom. 2. 4. and 2. Cor. 7. 1. else thou shalt wish in vaine, that thou hadst abated thy haughty stomacke, and humbled thy selfe vnder the mighty hand of God, obeyed his Ministers, & watched for this day, but all too late.
            3. Looke what paine and penance thou wouldst then gladly vndergoe, to obtaine saluation, if in that dreadfull day it should bee granted thee, and doe it now voluntarily, assay, labour, and liue so now in such sort as thou wouldest wish, then thou hadst liued in, that thou need not heereafter take vp the fooles prouerbe, I neuer thought of it, else be sure the Iudge will ouer-turne all thy stuffe, more throughly then Laban did Iacobs, & search all the corners of Ierusalem as with a cādle, & thou shalt be vnable

to hide the least thought from him, much lesse the originall as actual impieties, & abhominations of thy sinful life.
            4 Cōsider, that as his promises be most free to all that in due time will accept therof: so in that daywil he in iustice most seuerely punish the contemners therof.
            5. Marke here with me the superexcellent purity, and diuine sincerity of Christian religion, and the vpright integrity it requireth in euery man, and with what exquisite precisenesse it exacteth the same purity in daily practise, and therefore see that against the day of death and of iudgement thy croppe be answerable to thy seede sowne, Galat. 6. 7. 8. Ier. 12. 13. and therefore setting now and for euer aside all prophanenesse and vnion, or communion with the wicked, and all wickednesse; addresse thy selfe, (if thou wilt then escape this punishment) to lead a pure, sincere, & vpright life, according to the contents of the fifteenth Psalme; and to the purity and sole sincerity of the religion thou professest; for thou now seest that the vngodly shall not stand in iudgement, nor

the sinners in the assembly of the righteous, Psal. 1. 5. therefore approue now thy selfe a wise man, striue for this heauenly prize, and looke not backe to Sodom with Lots wife, when thou mayest escape hell fire: the difference betweene a wise man and a foole is; a wise man wil foresee a mischiefe ere it come, and auoid it: but a foole will doe neyther.
            Heere first wee may see what shall bee 
               Vse 1. 
               done vnto the men whom the King of Kings will honour, they shall be preferred farre aboue the honour King Assuerus bestowed vpon Mordecai, Ester 6. 9. and 8. 15. and 9. 4. for as in great Assises Noble men, and men of worth, are for honour sake made to sit on the bench with the chiefe Iudge: so the Elect (as standing below in a place too low for them) are now called to sit vpon the seat of iudgement, with the chiefe Iudge, to iudge the wicked, as Luke 22. 30. which passeth all the glory of this world by infinite degrees, and yet such honour haue all his Saints, and after thence goe to greater, euen to life eternall, the excellency

whereof, the wit of man in this life is vncapable: and therefore as I haue no tongue to describe it, no more haue ye eares to heare it, onely let vs beleeue it, and neuer cease to pray for it, vntill wee come and enioy it, and in the meane while, seeing the Scriptures (as of purpose) be sparing in describing these celestiall ioyes, I will not be copious in relating them, but contain my selfe within my measure and labour, to bee wise with sobriety, which the Lord grant me to doe.
            The second vse we are to make heereof, Vse 2. is this, that seeing the ioyes of the Elect, and the glory of the Kingdom prepared for them, is vnspeakeable, glorious, and blissefull. It stands all men and women vpon to long for it, and by all meanes whatsoeuer it cost them, to labour to obtaine it, and no longer to fixe their hearts vpon this life, and world so decoitfull and transitory: and if Cleombrotus

an vnvaluable prize: a wise Pilgrime will forbeare all delights, that hinder his returne home, and reserue all pleasure, vntill he come to his owne country; and so should wee poore pilgrimes in this strange country, cast vp our eyes to heauen our country, and iourneyes wished end, and be much greeued when by the least meanes wee are out of our way thither; and be sure euer to vse the things of this life as a Pilgrime doth his staffe, who makes much of it, while it furthers him in his way; but if it trouble him, he flings it away: and questionlesse, whosoeuer desireth earnestly, and perswades himselfe of saluation, will little regard the ioyes of this sinfull, troublesome world, but still will call, Come

all the world, shall bee most righteous, sincere, and vpright; for as at the barre of an earthly Iudge, the prisoners are from the goale, brought forth and presented before the Iudge, and there the bookes are opened, their causes examined, and they according to the produced euidences, acquitted or condemned: so in that great day, shall euery man without exception, be brought before Gods tribunall to be tried, according to their workes, 2. Cor. 5. 10. Math. 25. 35. 42. because their outward works are plaine euidences of their hearts and inward graces or vices. Now the manner of The manner two-fold. this manifestation is two-fold: first, their workes must be made known what they be: secondly, they must be prooued to be good or euill. The reuealing of the workes is said in Dan. 7. 10. Reuel. 20. 12. to bee by opening of the books (not that What meant by opening the booke.

Cor. 2. 14. Therefore the Lord in mercie humbleth himselfe, lispeth and speaketh after the manner of men; for as Iudges when they come to the bench, and the prisoners are set before them, then the bookes of their information, euidences, and inditements, &c. are opened and read before them, whereupon a Iury is impanelled, to determine whether the parties be guilty or not, and then accordingly the Iudge giueth sentence:

so shall it be heere, that albeit all things are open in his sight, and hee euer knoweth all mens workes, (as if hee had written and read them out of a booke, Psal. 139. 16. Ier. 23. 23.) yet it is said, that then the bookes shall bee opened. These What, and how many bookes be opened. 1. The booke of Gods word books be, first, the Word of God, which is the ground and foundation of all; for as the Law was deliuered at Sinai, to be a rule for euery mans life, and the Gospell a rule for faith, so now must all bee iudged according to that booke. So our Sauiour affirmeth in Iohn 12. 48. and 17. 20. The word that I haue spoken shall iudge him in the last day: and saith Paul, Rom. 2. 16. At the day when God shall iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ, according to my Gospell. The second booke is the booke of euery mans Conscience, Rom. 2. 12. 14. 15. 2. The booke of conscience. 
               They shall shew the effect of the Law written in their hearts, their Consciences also bearing them witnesse, and their thoughts accusing one another, or excusing: for the Lord by his secrets and omnipotent power, shall in that day so awake and touch euery mans conscience with the guilt of their sinnes, (which now is rocked

in the cradle of security, and sleepeth as a snorting dogge, or as a clasped booke is shut vp, that it dare not peepe nor mutter) that they all shal be brought as fresh and perfect into their remembrance, as they were the very day they were done, with all the circumstances thereof, that possibly they cannot bee denied, 1. Cor. 4. 5. So that being left excuseless, needs they must confesse them, as men at the gallowes, and holding vp their hands, cry guilty, as Gen.

Iohn 8. 7. 9. for their Consciences shal be as a thousand witnesses, enforcing them to accuse, iudge, and vtterly condemne themselues, before the Iudge doe iudge or condemn them, which will be the cause that they shall not bee able (as wicked as they be) to finde any fault with the Iudges proceeding against them, for they (confounded at the sight of their sinnes) will abhorre themselues, and confesse they deserued all punishments as God will put vpon them, and more too, and so the Lord shall bee iustified by the Reprobates themselues. The third booke is,

the book of life, that is, of mans Election, Reuel. 20. 12. 15. mentioned also in Psal. 69. 92. Dan. 12. 1. Philip. 4. 3. Reu. 3. 5. and 13. 8. and 17. 8. and 21. 27. and 22. 19. Ex. 32. 32. 34. Isa. 34. 16. Now according to The book of Life and Election. these three bookes the world shall bee iudged, whereto may bee added the fourth booke, which is the booke of Gods 
               The booke of Gods workes. 
               workes, which for 2000. yeares instructed the world, and by which the holy Patriarkes profited exceedingly; witnesse the Patriarkes all from Adam to Moses, and also the booke of Iob, and that this shall be iudge, may be gathered out of Rom. 1. 19. to 26. Psal. 19. 1. &c. and 8. 2. &c. and these bookes may properly be said to be so many witnesses, for, or against them that day.
            The Vses then wee are to make of The 1. vse of these 4. bookes. The vse for Gods word. these bookes are these:
            1. That euery man bee watchfull to study the whole booke of Gods worde, seeing we must be iudged by the same, that so they may know what to doe, and what to leaue vndone: wee see theeues, though they regard no Lawes nor equity, yet vvhen they be attached, and

see they must appeare at the Assises, they vvill be very carefull to peruse vvhat statutes make for them; or against them, that so they may in that day be able to answer according to Law, and by Law plead, defend, and free themselues: and how much more should vve doe so, seeing the danger is greater, and we know wee shall bee iudged by this booke of bookes, especially seeing we are before-hand fore-told and commanded so to doe? (as Deut. 6. 6. &c. Iosh. 1. 7. 8.)
            2. Then, in that wee shall be iudged Vse 2. 
                     •
                  or Conscience. by the booke of Conscience, (the great Chancery booke) we must be carefull so to liue according to the prescript rule of Gods word, that vvee sinne not against our consciences, nor knowledge in the word of God; for there is no burthen to the burthen of a wounded conscience, euer forecasting fearefull things, iudgeing and condemning himselfe (as Iudas, who seeing the greatnesse of his sinne, (and not of Gods mercy) accused and hanged himselfe, not able to abide the horror thereof) and therfore if our conscience controule vs, let vs in prayer, reperitance,

faith, & new obedience, speedily be reformed, and quiet it, else let vs assure our selues, that howsoeuer worldlings say, that Conscience is hanged, it will reuiue and hang vs; for it is resembled to a bawling Mastiffe, which thogh at his Masters doore it fall asleepe, yet if any awake him, he will take him by the throat; and so will a wounded Conscience Tenera res conscientia, quae 
                     •
                  ec tangi, nec angi potest. awake when the Lord by any iudgement toucheth it, and cause vs destroy our selues: for the Conscience is choyce and tender, like the Apple of a mans eye, the least moate will chafe it, and disquiet the whole man: and therefore must we charily keepe it as the apple of our eye, which is done by eschewing all euill, and doing all good wee can to all men.
            3. In that vve shall be iudged by the booke of life, that is, if God hath before To Vse for Gods election. all vvorlds elected vs to saluation, then shall we vndoubtedly be saued, else not: Now for the making our Electiō sure to our selues, or rather, for the assuring of our selues, that we are elected, vve must haue an earnest care to leade godly liues

stored with all heauenly graces, as Peter exhorteth, saying, Ioyne vertue with your faith, and with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience godlines, &c. Make your Calling and Election sure; for if you doe these things, you shall neuer fall, 2. Pet. 1. 3. to 12. for vvee must know, that as God called vs to the end, that is, to bee saued of his owne vndeserued mercy; so hee calleth vs to the meanes, whereby vvee may come to this end, vvhich is by leading a godly life, as Rom. 8. 29. 30. Eph. 1. 3. 4. and therefore must vve labour by hearing, reading, and practising Gods word, to serue Gods election, and make it sure to our selues, that vvee are elected, and shall questionlesse be saued: but if we contemn the word, resist the spirit, and regard not to leade a godly life, but follow the torrent of the wicked, it is plaine, we vvere neuer elected, and neuer shall be saued, but be put out of the booke of life, as the Lord said to Moses, whosoeuer hath sinned against mee, I will put him out of my booke, Exod. 32. 33. that is, it shall bee euident

his name vvas neuer written there; and the like speech is in 1. Sam. 2. 30. vvherefore the Lord God of Israell said to Eli, I said that thy house, and the house of thy Father, should walke before me for euer. But now the Lord saith, it shall not be so; for them that honour me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be despised. So that we need not climbe vp to heauen, to see if our names bee written in the booke of life, but descend into our selues, and examine our liues, if wee lead godly liues we are surely elected; for else vve could neuer haue the grace to be godly, and contrarily.
            The fourth Vse is to contemplate and Vse 4. For Gods workes. meditate in a deuout and thankefull heart vpon all the vvorkes of God, and abuse them not, but conuert them all to the glory of God, 1. Cor. 10. 31. and to the good of his Church.
            The next Vse serues for terror to the The secōd Vse, for terror. wicked, vvho vvhen these bookes be open, and first the booke of life be shut against them, that they haue no hope nor helpe to be saued: and next vvhen the bookes of Gods vvord be opened,

and it testifie what a great despiser and persecutor thereof, and of all the Articles of the Couenant of Grace, therein registred thou hast beene, as also of the Preachers and Professors thereof, reuiling all good men, and blaspheming thy Iudge, extinguishing and spiting the very spirit of grace; and heereunto thy Conscience (as a thousand witnesses) will giue testimony, and cry vnto God for iudgement; and the booke of Gods works, yea all Gods creatures, but specially the poore, widdow, fatherlesse, and stranger cry against thee for spilling innocent bloud, for detaining the hirelings wages, for oppressing the impotent, and for thy Sodomitry, and all creatures rise in iudgment against thee, what wilt thou doe for shame and sorrow? yea what paine and confusion of face will it be to thee, when by the wide and broad opening of these bookes, all thy sinnes of omission and commission, all thy mischiefes and treacheries, thy blasphemies, scornings, scoffings, reuilings, buffetings, persecutings, and all thy indignities done formerly against

the Iudge himselfe, his Church, his Ministers and people, with the Sacriledge, Oppressions, Thefts, and Robberies, &c. shall be all discouered, and laid open in the face of all the world: yea, besides these, the villenies (which hitherto thou hast so closely couered vvithin the secret and darke corners of thy heart and habitation) which thou deemest should neuer come to light, are now before God, and all the world detected, so that both God and Man, Angells and Saints, thy Conscience and all creatures shall howt thee, abhorre, and in disdainfull and scornefull manner, pointing at thee, say: Behold the man & his works! How shalt thou then at this clamor (no more then a theefe or a traitor, hold vp thy head) shew thy face, be able to stand in iudgement, or hope for release, or any fauour from thy persecuted Iudge, or his Ministers, (thy ancient enemies) when (as thou diddest to Gods people) they hate, loath, abhorre and spit at thee and all thine abhominations, yea laugh at thy destruction, saying, Depart from vs thou cursed into euerlasting fire.
               
Be wise then in time, watch, and pray, repent, and lead a new life, and thou shalt escape all these out-cryes and be numbred among the sonnes of God.
            The second point to bee obserued in Their worksmust tried to be good or euill. the manner of Christs proceeding in iudgement, is, when the workes be thus manifested, they must further bee conuinced to be euill or good, and so to deserue hell, or (by Christs mercy) heauen; and that triall must be done after this manner. First, such as liue out of the Church, and neuer heard of Christ, neither was his word preached among them, they must be iudged by the Law of Nature, Rom. 2. 12. 14. 15. and the couenant of workes, and testimony of their conscience, together with the booke of Gods workes, Rom. 1. 18. to 26. and secondly, such as liue in the Church by the Law of Nature, and the Law written, and the Gospell: as also by the booke of their Conscience, and the booke of Gods works, Iohn 5. 45. and 12 48. for the sentence of the Iudge shall be nothing else but a manifestation declaratory, and ratified execution of the

sentence formerly pronounced by the Preachers out of the Word, and lightened by nature.
            The Vse is for admonition to the ignorant, Vse for admonition to the ignorant. to submit themselues to the meanes ordained for their saluation, and neuer to forget that Christ will come with his mighty Angells in flaming fire, rendring vengeance vnto them that doe not know God; and which obay not the Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ, 2. Thes. 1. 8. and therfore not with the wicked to degenerate from men to goates, and beastlinesse, Isa. 13. 21. but rather of men to labor by vsing all godly meanes of men, to become sheepe, and the Saints of God by regeneration, Isa. 11. 6. &c. and beware wee to sell for gold or siluer, that which was not redeemed with gold nor siluer, but it cost more to redeeme their soules, Psal. 49. 7. so that the whole world cannot ransome mans soule, Math. 16. 26. and therfore more then madde are they that will forfeit so precious a iewell to Satan, & damnation for the loue of any trifling pleasure or profit whatsoeuer. And so farre of the eleuenth Motiue.
            
               
The twelfth Motiue to Watchfulnes The 12. Motiue. The denoū cing of the definitiue sentence. The necessity to know Christs iudgement vpon the wicked. is, the vpright denouncing of Christs definitiue sentence vpon all the world, which is indeed the very doome & iudgement it selfe. All that hitherto hath been spoken, is but preparation to this period, and this Iudgement is necessary to bee known of vs, because it maketh much for the well ordering of our liues, and preparing for the same in serious watchfulnesse and prayer; for if it be better to goe to the house of mourning, then to the house of feasting, because this is the end of all men, and the liuing shall lay it to his heart: and againe, the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth, Eccles. 7. 4. 6. & whatsoeuer thou doest, remember the end, and tho

                   shalt neuer do amisse, Ecclus. 7. 36. Then verily the consideration of Gods mighty and terrible iudgement, should much more moue our hearts to due preparation for this day, which is more He

Pet. 3. 3. 4. Iude 18. Ezech. 12. 22. out, yet in this day the truth of the Ministers predictions and threats will appeare true, according to Acts 17. 31. and then shall they see & feele to their cost that which formerly they would not beleeue, though it was told them, and was an article of the faith. Now this sentence is The first part of the sentence vpon the Elect. twofold, according to the two diuers sorts of people who are to be this day iudged, that is of the Elect vpon the right hand, & Reprobate vpon the left: but first, hee will deale with the Elect; for in this case it shall fare with the world, as if an earthly King should sit in iudgement, to arraigne a number attainted Similie. of high treason: yet so, that before he commeth to sit in iudgement, he knoweth by their former priuate examinations, confessions, and euidences, who be guilty, who not, so that vvhen the prisoners be presented before him,

hee forth-with causeth the guiltlesse Earles and Lords to be vnbolted, arraied in cleane apparell, and stand apart, or come vp vnto him, and sit vpon the bench, and then declaring before all the assembly, their innocency & wrongs acquitteth them, with all fauour and honour, and as his truest and trustiest subiects, causeth them (as ioyned in commission with him) to iudge and testifie what they can informe against those ranke traitors: so heare when the Lord sitteth vpon the throne of his glory, and separateth the sheepe from the goates, he foreknowing by their former liues ledde vpon earth, the innocency of the Eiect will in the sight of all the world iustifie, absolue and acquit them from all guilt and punishment, saying vnto them, first ofal, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit ye the kingdome prepared for you from the foundations of the world, &c. Math. 25. 34. and withall, declareth vnto them the reason of this high prerogatiue & preferment; for I was an hungred, and ye gaue me meat, &c. vers. 35. 36. against which reason when they (good men) answere, acacknowledging

in al humility that they remembred not any good, they (miserable sinners) did to him, but all came of his mercy and merits: he replieth, that what they did to the meanest of his poore brethren, they did it to him, and therefore meet it was that hee in royall bountifulnesse should remember, acknowledge, and highly reward them, answerable to the loue he bare to his distressed and afflicted brethren, whom he loued better then himselfe, & so rewards them now, as himselfe receiuing them to his owne inheritance and glory. But first causeth them to sit vpon thrones, to iudge the wicked with him according to his former promise, and couenant made with them in Mat. 19. 28. 29. Luk. 22. 30. and 1. Cor. 6 2. 3. not that they shal simply iudge the world, for all iudgement is by God the Father committed vnto the Sonne, Iohn 5. 22. but because they shal sit as assistants and witnesses, and approouers of his iust iudgement against the wicked; for it fareth heere with the Lord, as vvith a Noble King when he commeth to sit in iudgement vpon a matter of importāce,

hee being set vpon his Throne will call (as assistants) his next and best beloued kindred of the bloud royall and nobility to sit next him, then the inferior Iudges and Iustices to iudge with him, not that they manadge the businesse, and giue iudgement as they vvill, but because by their presence they witnesse & approue the equity of the Iudges sentence, and so shall it be here on that day.
            This sentence shall first be pronounced The Reasons why the Elect sit to iudge the wicked vpon the Elect, to absolue & iustifie them, and to call them to him, to iudge together with him, that is, to witness & approoue his proceedings against the wicked, not only because hee is most inclined to mercy, and slow to wrath: but
            1. First, Because hee is to honor them with this dignity, to iudge the world.
            2. For that this is the Elects long expected day of triumph ouer the wicked, their afflicters & persocutors, & therfore meete it is, that before their eyes they should be aduanced to this glory (according to Wis. 5. 1. 2.) to their great sorrow.
            3. The Apostles & Ministers and all Gods Saints, are members of Christs mysticall

body, and therefore meet they should sit with him, as a fulnesse of his perfection and glory, the head and body conioyned together as one person.
            4. Christ this day will haue his aduersaries all stand and stoop before himselfe and his whole Church, whom they sometimes abused and iudged wrongfully.
            5. They shall iudge the wicked by testifying against them for contemning their doctrine, and examples of an holy life, and so make the wicked excuselesse; Math. 25. 26. Luke 11. 31. and such honour haue all his Saints, Psal. 149. 9. farre aboue the honour done Mordecai by Assuerus, Est. 6. 9. and 8. 15. and 10. 23. or by any King to his Subiects.
            But heere
                  •
               t may be demanded how the Elect then are iudged according to 
               Obiect. Or question how the Elect are iudged according to their works 
               their workes, (as is said they shall be, in Rom. 2. 6. and 2. Cor. 5. 10. and 11. 15. and 1. Pet. 1. 17. Reuel. 2. 23. and 20. 12. 13. and 22. 12.) when they themselues confesse & acknowledge that they did no good workes? Math. 25. 37. 38. 39.
            I answer, Our Sauiour taketh better

notice of the good workes of the faithfull, then they doe themselues, for they (good men) euer eyed their sinnes, and the corruptions of their nature, and heeded not their good workes, (according to Math. 6. 4. 5.) but our Sauiour did, and calleth them good workes, Math. 25. 35. 36.
            2. We see also the godly themselues when they be accused and traduced, as workers of iniquity, they to cleare themselues, appeale to Gods iudgements, Psa. 26. 1. &c. and then can make large Catalogues of their good workes, as Iob 29. and 30. and 31. and Dauid in many of his Psalmes, and so many others: and therfore did good workes to testifie of their iustifying faith.
            3. Admit they all did not good works, but some were sinners; yet God, according to his Election, imputed not their sinnes to them, but forgaue them all, and with the Ysope of Christs merits, washed them in this life, and world, from all their sinnes, as Psal. 32. 1. and 51. 2. &c. and 1. Cor. 1. 30. 31. and 6. 9. Heb. 9. 13. Reuel. 7. 9. 14. and being in his couenant

and thus purified and washed, they shall this day appeare as cleane as if they had neuer beene defiled with any staine of sinne, and so are wee saued by Christs merits (as Iacob was blessed in Esaus apparell.)
            4. They were elected before all worlds to saluation, and to the meanes thereof, and they by their holy life and innocent conuersation serued Gods Election, and so their names being in the booke of life, could not be blotted out; nor they misse of saluation.
            5. Heauen was their inheritance, and so nothing, except fellony or treason, can defeat a man of his inheritance, nor that neyther, if the King doe pardon it, and all other his offences and transgressions; and so did Christ heere, as Psal. 103. 1. 2, 3. &c.
            6. They euer beleeue faithfully in Christ, and so were iustified by faith, and Christ tooke away and bore in his owne body, the curse due for their sinnes, Rom. 5. 1. &c. and 8. 1, &c. Galat. 3. 13. and so cannot iustly be condemned this day. And therefore Christ will vse no partiality,

but doe true and strict Iustice in absoluing and receiuing the godly to mercy, according to his gratious couenant.
            Let the wicked repent, and doe the Vse. like, and they shall with all loue and fauour receiue the like sentence, and bee aduanced to the like honour and glory then and euer after.
            But if you obiect that this is contrary Object. to the proceeding in all Courts terrene, to haue a mans enemies to be his Iudge, as the Ministers be to their persecutors, may they not except against them (as selons vse here on earth) no, for this is iust, that as vpon earth the iudged the Saints to death, spoyled, iniured, reuiled, and vniustly persecuted them: that they this day should doe them the like; measure for measure by the Law of retallion, Exod. 21. 24. Iudg. 1. 7. and 1. Sam. 15. 33. Luke 19. 25. but if thou wilt escape this Iiry, abuse them not, loue, and do them all good, and aboue all, procure the fauour of Christ the chiefe Iudge, & then all the Court of Heauen will intreat them kindely.
            
               
The second part of Christs defintiue The secōd part of the sentence vpon the Reprobate. sentence, shall bee directly against the Reprobate, and is already registred in Math. 25. vers. 41. Depart from me ye cursed into the euerlasting fire, &c. The reason is set downe in verse 42. for I was an hungred and ye gaue me no meat, &c. and the same sentence is ratified in vers. 45. In as much as ye did it not to one of the least, &c. And this is the sentence of condemnation, because our Sauior condemneth them to hell fire; for that they in their life time heere would not repent of their sinnes originall nor actuall, but daily more and more prouoked the Lord to wrath with their inuentions, neyther would they conuert and turne vnto the Lord, take him for their God, nor belieue in his name, nor by any meanes be perswaded to walke before the Lord in new obedience, and therefore refusing God, and his word and couenant, and being ashamed of him before men, hee now refuseth them, and is ashamed of them before his Father; his Angels, 
               Mat. 10. 33 
               and Saints, and cuts them from him to eternall damnation.
            
               
The Vses we are to make of this heauy Vse. sentence, are first to humble our selues vnder the mighty hand of God, and not stand vpon our gentry or reputation in the world, to scorne or set light to serue the Lord, lest a day come when our Sauiour will pull downe our pride, and say, Depart from me ye cursed into euerlasting fire: a rough speech, and heauy greeting (God wot) to such especially as when they were heere were in Sermons called with all reuerence, Right Honourable, Honourable, Right Worshipfull, Worshipfull; and if it please your Mastership, & if it may stand with your fauour, and vnder your correction good sir, and I beseech your clemency pardon my boldnesse in reprouing, with an hundred such like titles, contrarie to Iob 32. 21. 22. but now see how they bee saluted with the Deuils own title, (thou accursed). There was a time, that if Christ or any of his Ministers had greeted them thus, they would soone haue put their honour in the dust, with vae vobis, and God should haue (where they Lorded) no more seruice publike, then

they with their fauours allowed him, which should be little enough: and his Ministers, for all their preaching in his name, should haue as little ioy and comfort: And what abasing of them is this? (and that in the face of all the world) yet we see pride must haue a fall, and their case & stile is altered, now they are termed cursed, and outed from the Iudgement Luk. 4. 29. Act. 21. 28. seat, yea to hell, and iust it is; for there was a day when they outed the poore, and Christ himselfe in his members from them: and as then they were ashamed of him, he is so of them now, (as the shame of all his creatures, Mat. 10. 
                  •
               8.) Oh, what childe, seruant, wife, or subiect can abide to heare from the mouth of his deare father, louing husband, godly master, or most gracious Prince this terrible terme, Depart from me thou accursed, and that to hell for euer: so full of implacable indignation and wrath, anguish and sorrow, much lesse vttered from the mouth of so mild, mercifull, and gracious a Sauiour, and at such time as he most needs his helpe and fauour, then to forsake him, kills the

heart, yet right meet it is, that as formerly hee had abhorred God, and scorned to obey his Lawes, the Lord now should not fauour him: Oh consider this ye that forget God, and kisse the Sunne least 
               Psalm. 2. 
               he be angry; and withall marke the nature of these words, Depart from mee ye cursed to euerlasting fire, and thou shalt finde couched within these few words a world of woes, present and future, and in this one curse, all curses included, and obserue, he doth not now in execrable termes curse them, but sheweth how by leading heretofore a cursed life, and condemned by the Ministers, now our Sauiour ratifieth it, Mat. 16. 19. and 18. 18. Then consider the manner of vttering of this sentence, frō the gracious mouth of God himselfe, full of maiesty, full of power, and full of furious indignation and iustice, most strict and seuere, able to make not onely the hearts and soules of sinners, but the very center and whole frame of heauen and earth to tremble and quake, nay, to be dissolued to nothing. Moreouer, what can bee more wofull to a sinfull wretch, that somtimes

had beene in high place, thus to be reiected, and to see many Lazars, and Beggars, and Harlots, riffe-raffe sots, together with a rabblement of peeuish preachers, (as Kings now) to sit on thrones royall, to giue sentence and iudgement vpon his life and actions: nay, vvhich Note this ye hypocrites. is more, to see his owne parents, brethren, wife, children, and friends, forgetting all obligations of nature, amity, and humanity, to shew no token of sorrow, to speake no one good worde for him, in nothing to comfort him, but iustifying the Lord, to laugh at his destruction: neuer was poore wretch, how great a felon or traitor soeuer, condemned by an earthly Iudge, how mercilesse soeuer, but his sentence of death should euer end with this speech; And God haue mercy vpon thy soule, and many others taking him by the hand, would comfort him, and say, God helpe thee, we will pray for thee, be of good comfort; but heere is not one word of comfort, but heere soule and body deprived of all mercy and hope, is with a most terrible voyce surpassing all vnited

thunder-claps, cursed to euerlasting fire, without pity or comfort. Finally, see Note here O you that forget God. hence what it is to be separated for euer from God and all his Angels and Saints, and to be thrust among a rout and rabblement of Deuils and Reprobates: and this is an hell it selfe. We see how heauily a sucking-childe takes it to be separated but for a moment, and cast out of his mothers armes, how will he cry and take on, how nothing will please nor pacifie him, and yet the nurse will soone take him againe, neyther did shee cast him away in displeasure; but vvhen Christ in his wrath casteth out a sinner, he neuer takes him, neuer pitieth him, for heere no teares, prayers, sutes, cries, yellings, nor mournings can be heard, none will meditate nor speake for him, to reuerse or stay iudgement, but must without farewell be presently tumbled to hell. And heere consider yet all this while, and euer after what guilt of conscience is in the condemned, what biting enuy, what horror in minde, what distraction of wit, what muttering and murmuring, what cursing of themselues

their Parents, friends, and dumbe Ministers, what wringing of hands, knocking of breasts, what cries & howlings, filling heauen and earth: and what now would this damned person giue to obtaine Christs fauour, and to heare him say; Come thou blessed of my Father, but it will not be.
            The onely remedy is, now to turne Vse. while time serues, and to bee reconciled while hee requesteth thee, by his Ministers, 2. Cor. 5. 20. and then need'st thou not doubt of his fauour and grace, else hereafter shalt thou knock long enough at the gate of mercy, and not be heard. Therefore beloued in the Lord, seeing wee know the terror of the Lord this day, 2. Cor. 5. 11. and 2. Pet. 2. 311. Let vs stirre vp our hearts to conceiue & know these terrors of the Lord: I meane not onely in iudgement to conceiue them, but also in heart and affection to bee perswaded of the terrible fearefulnesse of this last iudgement, and in this regard not to content our selues with the gift of knowledge, and with an outward profession of piety, (as they in Math. 7. 22.

and 25. 3. 44. Luke 13. 26.) but to labor for soundnesse and sincerity of faith, of repentance, and new obedience, both in heart and life endeauouring alwaies to haue a good conscience towards God & man, else vanity of vanities, will become misery of miser

            The second point in this terrible iust sentence to be considered, is, the reason why Christ commits them to the fire eternall; because, that when he was hungry, thirsty, a stranger, naked, sicke, and in prison, they releeued him not, in his members, which bewrayed they had no faith in Christ, for had they, then would they loue his children, which was the fruit of faith, and hauing no faith, they could not apprehend Christ, nor appropriate his merits vnto them; and failing herein, Christ profited them nothing, and therefore they being out of Christ, were reprobated, neyther doth our Sauiour presse heere iustification by workes for we 
               Thom. Aqu. 
               are iustified effectiuely by Christ, apprehensiuely by faith, and declaratiuely by good workes; for albeit the kingdome

of God is giuen vs for the Election and promise sake, which the Saints receiue by faith, yet because faith and inward graces are hidden from mens eyes, therfore are good works commanded, commended, The benefits by doing good workes. and rewarded as the proper effectuall fruits of our faith and Election, and in doing good workes.
            First, we performe the duty of good and faithfull stewards.
            Secondly, we refresh the bodies of the best stayed seruants and Saints of God, to wit, his Ministers, and therewith lighted the heauy burthen of their cares, & mittigate their sorrowes, and so make their toylsome liues more comfortable vnto them, and giue them occasion to powre forth many an hearty prayer to God for vs, with much thankes to the Almighty for vsing vs instruments in so heauenly a worke.

his Sheepsheerers) feasted them as Kings, in so much as at the same thereof, all the fooles of the people, and out-scowring of the World repaired to them, and were vvelcome: as idle prophane gentleman, swaggerers, faulkoners, hunters, swearers, lazie seruing-men, drunkards, whoremasters, and the like vitious rabblement, & at Christtide and Wakes, sheep-shearing, & meddowdaies, kept open houses, come who list, (if he were of any fashion) and were ouerall the country renowned for it, yea wasted more in such riot and excesse in a day, then many a poore man would spend in a yeere, and this they intimate to Christ in Matthew 25. 44. VVhen saw wee thee an hungry, &c. and did not minister vnto thee, &c. they entertained all, vnlesse they vvere some peeuish Preachers, who vvould be alwaies finding faults, and carping at their best vvorkes, or some precise Professors that would bee catching at euery seuerall oath or speech a man vttered, or some base poore Lazaresses beeing full of very fulsome

diseases, all which were the disgrace of a gentlemans house, and to receiue and feast such, were to driue all good company out of their houses. Otherwise they spent and wasted all their annuall reuenues, and more to, and set themselues, many of them, ouer the shooes, that they could neuer recouer it againe, and all to keepe good hospitality, and bee good to the poore for their soules health, and see how now it is regarded of the Iudge, & no maruell; for as well had all this meat and drinke thus mispent (contrary to Christs commandement in Luke 14. 12. 13. 14.) When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours, &c. but the poore, the maimed, the lame, and the blinde, and thou shalt be blessed and recompenced at the resurrection of the iust: as well (I say) had it beene cast to dogs and hogs, then thus vpon Christs enemies, as they in Amos 6. 3. &c. for all this was done in hypocrisie, and for vaine-glory, but were not touched with the afflictions of Ioseph, nay for all these shewes, most of

them so afflicted Ioseph, that the yron entred 
               Psal. 105. 18. 
               into his soule, and were so farre from giuing, that they tooke by sacriledge, oppression, and violence, and cunningdealing from the poore, that which was their owne, and that which God and good men gaue them, so that if the Ammonites & Moabites were debarred Gods congregation vnto the tenth generation, because they met not the Israelites with bread and water when they came from Aegypt, Deut. 23. 3. 4. and if the rich glutton and corne-hoorder in Luke 12. 20. and 16. 23 went to hell for not giuing their owne to the poore, what shal become of them that not onely giue them nothing, but take from them that they haue, and persecute them too? and if they did giue them, yet how could the spoyles of the poore, and of Gods Church, bee taken and accepted for Almes by God. Nay Deut. 23. 17. 18. (but you will say) Many of these bountifull house-keepers were professors, deuout in prayer, prophecied, and by his name cast out Deuils, and did many great workes: they ate and dranke in his presence, and heard him teach in their streets, Math.
               
7. 22. 23. and 25. 44. Luke 13. 26. and shall they be damned too: (and so it is now) but we are to learne, that most excellent gifts will not auaile to saluation, vnlesse we haue true faith, sincere repentance, and new obedience, whereby we doe the will of God; and this is a point of great weight and moment, and worthy of obseruation: that men not onely in this life, and in death, but euen at the last day shall thus plead for themselues, and yet not be regarded, because that all was done in hypocrisie, and not in sincerity, and this should teach all men to beware of sprituall pride, selfe flattery, and selfe-loue, delighting in their externall gifts, as Pharisees, Luke 18. 11. Isa. 65. 5. whereby they flatter themselues in their estate, ouer-weening the good things they haue, and falsely thinking they haue that blessing of God, which they haue not, whereas in truth vve should labour to be purged of this pride, and euer suspect the worst of our selues, to iudge our selues seuerely and strictly in regard of our vnbeleefe and hollownesse of heart; for this will be a

meanes to make vs escape the iudgment and condemnation of the last day, and this is the property of Gods Elect to thinke worse of themselues then God doth, as we see in Math. 25. 37. but the reprobates haue euer better perswasion and opinion of themselues then God hath, as Math. 25. 44.
            To conclude then, let vs bee vpright and sincere, both in profession, and practise, and in continual prayer for grace, and bountiful willing hearts to do good works; for this is the meere gift of God, and without praier cannot be obtained, for we are naturally so couetous, so didistrustful in Gods prouidence and promises, such louers of our selues, & hard-hearted to others, that without his speciall loue and fauour to vs, it is vnpossible for vs to get this great victory ouer our selues; to bee mercifull, no not to Christ himselfe, nor to his Ministers, that maintained his honour and glorie, and therefore of all others ought most to be respected and releeued, and yet I wote not how (as a field vine, subiect to euery of winde and tempest) they be of

euery body most reiected, and least regarded, as the out-scowring of the world, and sheepe appointed for the slaughter: neyther can we afford the crums from our tables to Christs poore members, but rather giue them to dogges, hawkes, horses, whoores, and for Tobacco to vrge drunkennesse, to make vs sober and circularly able to bee drunken; so that it cannot be, but the Lord hath a controuersie with the inhabitants of the Land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land, but stealing, and lying, and whooring, swearing and killing, Hos. 4. 1. 2.

Lord should giue him more, or he should distribute more of that which was giuen, and I would the maid Mercy should bee maried to more then this Almoner, (for so, after, he was surnamed) that the maid Mercy should not liue so long a Virgin, as that a few or none will marry her: yet our Sauiour commands to sell what ye haue, and giue almes, make ye bagges which waxe not olde, a treasure which can neuer faile in heauen, Luke 12. 33. and to take heed that your hearts be not oppressed with surfeting and drunkennesse, and cares of this life, and lest that day come on you at vnawares, for as a snare it shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth: Watch therefore and pray continually, &c.

The priuatiue, is a depriuing of them from Christ their head, and from all goodnesse: from Christ, so that they haue nothing left in them but sin: as a boulter, when the flowre is boulted out, there remaineth nothing in it but brannes; so they, depriued of all Gods graces and life, haue nothing left in them but the brannes of sinne, and the second death. And thereupon (as formerly the badde Angells) are made, or rather become, as diuells incarnate. This priuatiue paine, some terme the paine of losse, or the losse of all blisse, which although it inflicteth no external sensible punishment, yet hath it within it, a positiue effect; for as the absence of

the Sunne causeth and bringeth darkenesse, Similies. and the want of foode death; so the absence of Christ Iesus the Sonne of righteousnesse, bringeth darkenesse to the soule, and the want of the food of life, death eternall: then which, what torment greater, then vtter darkenesse, and euerlasting death; for as the fulness of ioy is gotten by inioying his presence, Psal. 16. 12. so the fulnesse of sorrow is attained by his absence, and as he is the life quickening all creatures, so the want of him is the depriuation of life, and a second death.

Gods children, to consider before hand, what an vnrecouerable losse it will be to any creature, thus in wrath, and for euer to be separated from his God, and from all goodnesse, and to bee made a Deuill; for what made the falling Angells Deuills, but the depriuing & stripping of them from all graces and gifts of God, and to bee cast to all heauy designements. Then consider what childe, what seruant, or subiect can abide or endure to heare such terrible words, Depart from me ye cursed, so full of indignation, wrath, and anguish from the mouth of the most mercifull & euer blessed Sauiour of the world, knowing and foreseeing what losse followeth vpon the speaking of the words, and what vnspeakeable torments shal in the necke thereof seize vpon his soule and body, and that for euer in hell: and vvhat a shame of shames is it now to be thus disgraced and degraded before all the world, and that at such an instant, as he most needeth, and is most friendlesse &

helpelesse; and standeth vpon his doing or vndoing for euer: oh! this would kill a mans heart, and will cast downe the stoutest heart liuing; no sentence, no prison, no execution to this shame. Consider A Similie. but the case of a married wife, who though she lose all her friends, and liue in extreame penury, yet so long as shee enioyeth her husbands fauour and loue, she will comfort her selfe against all indignities; but if she play the harlot, and he say vnto her, depart from nice thou accursed whoore; this killeth her heart, she looseth all the benefits of wedlocke, incurreth the hatred of all men, and is cast into extreame misery and shame in the world to her dying day, and yet is this but a temporall losse, and in losing him, she

Esau sould his birth-right, and though hee sought the blessing with teares, hee could not finde it, Heb. 12. 17. Saul could not abide that the Lord would not answer him, and Iudas hanged himselfe; yea it was a death to Absolon, though a trecherous parricide, to be debarred his Fathers presence, 2. Sam. 14. 30. yet these had contentments in this life in full measure (vnlesse it were Iudas) but heere contentment is to be expected in nothing, no more then a swinner can drowning, who can catch at nothing but water: so these wretches swimming in the Lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, can catch and lay hold on nothing but at fire to helpe them withall.

The remedy, for all, then is this, to thinke now of this depriuation, and to preuent it, to performe such duties of faith and obedience, as we would then vvish vvee had performed in true and hearty repentance, and remember 2. Chro. 15. here now to exercise stoutnesse against sinne, Sathan, and all worldly vanities, Malachy 3. 13. and not for them against our good God and his Saints, and withall, as an effect of a true liuely faith, vse all mercy to the poore, and loue to Gods Ministers, and euer draw nye to God, that hee may draw nye in that day to vs: and so farre of the first member of this execution of the sentence, and of the priuatiue paines or sorrow of losse, and therefore in time prepare against it.

due for sinners, though they neuer were taught them out of Gods Word, yet they iudge these to bee the worthy reward of sinne and sinners. Secondly, the Scripture termes the place by these names, Hell, Math. 10. 28. Euerlasting perdition, 2. Thes. 1. 9. A Lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death, Reuel. 21. 8. the deepe, Luke 8. 31. Gehenni, or the valley of the sonnes of Himmon, Ier. 7. 30. and 19. 6. Math. 23. 23. Tophet, Isa. 30. 33. and 2. King. 23. 10. vtter darkenesse, Math. 23. 13. vnquenchable fire, Mat. 3. 12. and 13. 25. a place without, Reuel. 22. 15. which names as fearefull as they bee, expresse not the thousand part of the ineffable paines thereof: onely (as in a figure) by these names the Scripture lispe to our capacity, rather then in expresse termes, doe vtter the full effect of Gods wrath vpon sinners, and therefore in speaking of these torments, we must carefully beware that that which is figuratiuely spoken in Scripture, be not taken not expounded A Caution litterally as some doe; but learne and aduertise our hearers, that whereas vve

cannot conceiue nor vtter the extremity of these torments, nor the fulsomenesse of this horrible prison; yet the Scriptures expresse them by the sharpest and most intollerable punishments we know or can conceiue; as fire, brimstone, darkenesse, weeping, &c. and yet when wee haue heaped together all the attributes and names we know, all are insufficient to declare it, being incomprehensible, onely let vs beleeue what wee cannot vtter, and carefully auoid that cursed place betimes, lest then wee bee made to feele that which now wee will neither beleeue nor eschew, which God forbid, and so farre of the names thereof.
            Secondly, the nature of the place teacheth The nature of hell. what shall be the tortures and torments of such sinners as shall be cast into it (neither will I bee curious in this bloudy point, which nature abhorreth to bee prolixe in, but onely by some few circumstances, referre the deeper consideration thereof to euery mans secret meditation, praying Almighty God to worke in them and me heereby

such effects, that we may euer auoid the the things that bring vs to it; as for the nature of the place:
            1. Hell is described to be a prison, or dungeon prepared for the Deuili and his Angelis, Math, 25. 4. Christs, his, and our aduersaries, & must not God be reuenged vpon his enemies? and the more Christ powreth the vengeance of his reuenge vpon Satan, and all reprobates, the more is he glorified, and his power magnified, and therefore hell must be such a wide place as shall containe the whole wrath of God in the highest and extremest degree, and therefore the place must be terrible, where is nothing but vexing and tormenting iustruments of Gods wrath.
            2. The best places and sweetest vpon earth, if they be not kept cleane and sauoury, will soon become fulsome, much more will hell, made a place of dishonor, and of the execution of his wrath; for wee see how all places wherein God inflicteth the iudgement of his wrath, are full of horror, as Ierusalem, Math. 23. 37. Babel, Isa. 13. 19. Bozra in Edom, Isa.
               
34. 11. 12. Niniueh, Z
                     •
                  ch. 2. 13. 14. &c. much more hell, wherevpon light all Gods curses.
            3. If worldly prisons and dungeons become so fulsome, that in short time men lose therein their health and liues, for the stinch & want of contentments, much more in hell, for all prisons be paradises to this, and the horror thereof passeth all horrors; so that the very deuils desire respit, not to be sent thither, Luke 8. 31.
            4. Here are all the torments of Gods wrath, as fire, brimstone, and such fire as burneth euen spirits, surpassing all fires: Oh what anguish and torment sustaineth he that is subiect to these instruments.
            5. This further aggrauateth the terror and horror of the place, in that it containeth not onely all the tortures and instruments of Gods fearfull vengeance, but is a place of vtter darkenesse and blackenesse, that is voyd of all comfort, farre beyond Pharachs plague of 3. daies palpable darkenesse, Exod. 10. 21. but this for euer the soarest punishment

that can be inflicted vpon man, is to cast him to a dungeon or darke place, and yet this is nothing to that; a plague of plagues, fitting such as sinne in darknes, and that call darkenesse light, Iohn 3. 19. Ezech. 8. 12. Isa. 5. 20. Ephes. 5 8. 11. &c.
            
            6. Then the company they finde there, be the Deuill and his Angelis, all Reprobates and badde people, as full of malice, hatred, and all villeny, as euer they were when they liued vpon earth, albeit the close prison keepes them from practising it: and what a death is it for a man to bee constrained to liue euer in such a company, where Satan and his Angells hatred to man is now greater then euer it was? for now to their eternall confusion, they feele the full reward of their wickednesse wrought to man, who might haue stood in their Angelllike state, had it not beene for man, and therefore ceaseth not in all they can to maligne all Reprobates, and the like do one Reprobate to another, as agents of one anothers misery.
            7. Their exercise in hell is weeping, and gnashing of teeth, so that they cannot

speake nor thinke any one good thing. Thus we see both the name, nature, and circumstances of this fearefull place, and therefore being so terrible, it were wisedome for all men to beware of it, and labour for heauen to dwell in euer.
            The other sort of the paines positiue The inward positiue paines bee called the internall paines inflicted vpon both soule and body, which may bee guessed partly, by that which hath beene spoken of the prison, and partly by the punishment which shall be layed vpon the soule it selfe, and all the faculties thereof, as the cogitation, memory, vnderstanding, will, and affections, &c. then of the body, and of euery member therof, for wherein euery man sinneth, therein is he tormented: But these torments are partly vnknown, and so I pray God they may euer be, and partly so lamentable, that no Christian heart can abide to dwell long vpon so dolefull a subiect, and therefore I referre you to others that writ largely thereupon; beseeching Almighty God to giue vs all grace to consider wisely, and in time of all that hath beene said, and to

make a ready vse thereof to Gods glory and our saluation, and not to run sottishly vpon Gods iudgements, denying there is an hell, as doe Sadduces, Atheists, Ideots, Infidels, and Nullifidians, and vngodly liuels, whose liues proclaime it 
                  〈◊〉
                and 2. such as deny there is any heauen, as Epicures, Belly-gods, Worldlings, Sodomites; Inordinate liuers, idlers out of a calling, &c. 3. all Theeues, Oppressors, Sacriledgers, poore Cony-catchers. 4. all Protestants at large, Christians without faith or good workes, Selfe louers, Hypocrites, Mis
                  〈…〉
               cordists, Origenists, &c. but let vs watch and pray.
            The first vse wee are to make of this thirteenth Motine, serues to shew how necessary it is for all men to know this principle concerning hell, & the reward of the wicked, & that in these respects.
            1. It bringeth the wicked to the Vse. 1 Rea
                     •
                  ons prouing it necessary to know that 
                     〈…〉
                  re is an hell. knowledge and feare of God, for when they consider the vnspeakeable power that is in the mildest word proceeding from Gods mouth, they must needs accuse the hardnesse of their owne hearts,

vpon which it cannot worke, vnlesse it be to their destruction, whereas here we see the commanding voyce of God (to depart from him.) to be so forcible and powerfull, that neither man nor deuill is able to withstand it, but all as slaues from the whip will runne to hell fire, and therefore should they now not sin against the Lord, whose very voyce is more terrible then hell it selfe, and this reason vseth Dauid, in Psal. 29. 4. out, to exhoxt all men, and by name the mighty Nimrods betimes to obey his glorious voyce in his word.
            2. Satan would perswade all men that there is no hell, thereby to set all to worke iniquity without remorse, and therefore this doctrine must be often whetted vpon them to feare.
            3. Most men, yea Professors (though they can discourse heereof) are so wicked, euen in the very bosome of the Church, and liue so loosely, as if there were no hell at all; for how few will for feare thereof, forgoe on
                  •
                houres pleasure, or one mite of profit, or auoid any temptation Satan can cast at them, and

therefore needful it is to set before them often, what dainty fare they shall finde in hell, whether they hasten: and if this will not reforme them, nothing will, seeing it is the last remedy in the Bible vsed to presse men with.
            4. Were there no heauen to enioy, no God to reward, no hope of immortality, yet should men for feare to burne in hell, forbeare now to sinne; for vve see how men for feare of temporall penalties, forbear to transgresse the Lawes of the land; yet Gods lawes, penalties, nor promises, which far surmount these are not regarded: heere a felon or traitor may be pardoned, there no obstinate malefactor shall, and though for a while he respiteth him in this life, it is but to reach his hand the higher, to let the weight of his stroke in the life to come to fall vpon him the heauier, and his deferring is the more to inferre the thicker and surer blowes, and of no ill paiment shall he need to complaine that hath the wages of his wickednesse withheld from him in this life, to receiue the totall summe together, and for euer in

hel, this would breed in the most valiantest Atheist liuing, such a gasping terror, and quaking dislike, that euer after hee should abhor, not onely the least branch of sinne, but withall euery thing alluring or aspecting thereto, and vvithall should haue hell it selfe pictured in euery corner of his gardens, orchards, banqueting houses, and places of delight, in more carefull manner then euer had the Pharisies Gods lawes, broydered vpon the fringed Phylacteries of their garments, and so would, notwithstanding now all parents and superiors doe well, & their duty it is often to relate to their families the paines ordained in hell fire, and so admonish them to beware of that burning place.
            5. The knowledge that there is an hell is behoofefull in sundry respects, as 1. it rectifieth the conscience, when the neuer-dying worme gnaweth thereat, and signifieth vnto vs that still we haue some vnrepented sinners, summoning vs to iudgement and damnation, 1. Ioh 3. 20. 2. this should cause vs in all our carriage to misdoubt our actions euery

of them, and euer setting the Lords blessed word before vs, feare him who is able to cast soule and body to hell, Math. 10. 38. 3. it should make vs wary neuer to forfeit, but still to retaine sure our title to Gods kingdome, and therefore be carefull neuer to commit any of those sinnes that depriue vs of Gods kingdome, as be in 1. Cor. 6. 9. Galat. 5. 19. Eph. 5. 3. &c. 4. It maketh vs thankefull for our Election, & withall teacheth vs to be careful to obserue the same in the whole course of our liues, lest wilfully we relapse, and euer feare all our waies, Ephes. 1. 3. to 7. 5. This is a forcible meanes to weane vs from the world and all sinfulnesse, and to cause vs to hasten to enter in couenant with God afresh, and so open a doore to heauen, and to all Christs treasures of grace, which God grant we doe speedily.
            The second Vse serues for reproofe Vse. 2. There is an hell. of such as deny there is any hell, and therefore will not watch: these be Atheists, Nullifidians, Epicures, Worldlings, inordinate liuers, malefactors, &c. but that there is an hell, appeares by the

aboue quoted titles of hell. 2. By our consciences, accusing when we sinne. 3. the very Heathen in all ages and places (how prophane soeuer) affirmed, that malefactors should to hell. 4. Chysostome in his Homelies 48. and 49. and 50. Ad populum Antiochenum, confuteth this error. And therefore let all men stand in awe and sinne not; but beleeue, lest they approoue worse then the Deuils, who beleeue and confesse it, and tremble at the minding thereof, Iames 2. 19.
            The third Vse is for admonition for Vse 3. all men generally, that seeing there is an hell, and the paines thereof vnspeakable, yea so great, as no heart can conceiue, onely by the names of the extreamest punishments vpon earth, as fire, brimstone, darkenesse, death, an euereating worme, and neuer dying, they bee shadowed, because vvee can conceiue no soarer nor greater torments, all vvorldly torments bee finite and temporall, these infinite, spirituall, pittilesse, easelesse, remedilesse, a paine beyond all paines and greefe, surmounting all greefes at the very

names whereof the very Deuils, how hard-hearted & gracelesse soeuer tremble and quake: heere all springs of mercy are locked against such as shewed no mercy, no one word of comfort to such as denied comfort to the comfortlesse; heere Lazarus the beggar scornes to be at a gentlemans command, to reach him a droppe of water, for that hee denied him the crunme
                  •
                that fell from his table, which now to his cost he rues it, and feeles the wants and heauy heart of a poore man, and iust it is that such as stop their eares at the cry of the poore, should then cry and not be heard. Oh dolefull place that yeelds no comfort! and oh more wretched people that foresee not this misery to preuent it! but most miserable, that now hearing and knowing it, no warning will serue them, no calling will awake them, no threatnings, no not hell fire will terrifie them, and therefore such as haunt mischeefe shall fall into it: But O ye holy watchmen, Exhortatiō to the Ministers to warne the people hereof. and sheepheards of the people! for Christs sake cry out aloud, lift vp your voyces like a trumpet, giue thosee sleepers

no rest vntill they bee awaked from their deadly sleep; and you godly Christians exhort one another whilest it is called to day, lest your hearts be hardened by the deceitfulnesse of sinne, and this day come suddenly vpon you, and take you away when a mans house is set on fire, all the towne and country will forthwith arise to helpe to quench the fire, and it is very well done; but heere mans soule and body is set on hell fire, yet to preuent this danger, (which is more then the burning of an house or towne) no man helpes, the watchman is asleepe, the gentleman, though the house of his soule be all fired, snorts in his sinne, and must not be awaked, the neighbors help to rocke him in the cradle of security vntill death comes and arests him to come to iudgement, and then the man and his workes fall in the fire; and what misery findeth he not there? the guilty conscience, the neuer-dying worme, the flames vnquenchable, the darkenes frightfull, comfort no where, paines without, and terrors within. The holy Martyrs burning heere in the flames of fire, felt

no such matter, they died in a good cause, had a good conscience towards God and man, vvere very cheerefull, forgaue their enemies, prayed for the Church, exhorted one another to patience and constancie, perswaded, comforted and confirmed the people in the truth, reioyced in spirit, sang prayses to God, prayed instantly to the very last gaspe committed their soules to God, in full hope of a ioyfull resurrection; and finally (as in a burnt sacrifice) more then Conquerers, ascended vp to Heauen, which should animate all men to retaine a good Conscience, leade a godly life, and be sure of a blessed comfortable death, and resurrection: vvhereas contrarily, a bad Conscience, and the guilt of a wicked life, portendeth a fearfull death, & an heauy resurrection to be executed in hell fire.
            But heere the wicked coyne obiections, Obiect. Reasons why sinners torments be so great in hell. and demand how it is that the mercifull God can finde in his heart thus strangely and seuerely to punish any sinner, seeing our sinnes cannot hurt him, nor our piety benefit him, Iob. 35. 6. 7.

and 32. 3. If all be in heauen, hee is not the richer, nor if they be all in hell, is he the poorer.
            I answer. 1. God is almighty, whose infinitenesse of power, wisedome, and iustice, makes him willing and able to inflict vpon sinners the most exact and sharpest punishment, as pleaseth his Maiesty, and therefore as he is a God, and mighty in all his workes, that is to say, great, wonderful, & terrible, Nahum. 1. 1. &c. Cant. 8. 6. 7. Deut. 29. 20. so specially sheweth he the same in punishing Reprobates, and for that cause is called the God of righteousnesse, and the God of vengeance, Psal. 94. 1. 2. and seeing all his other workes be wonderfull, and full of Maiesty, we may be assured hee is so in smiting the wicked.
            2. As his mercy & patience is vnspeakable great in inuiting & waiting for sinners repentance, Rom. 2. 4. so is his iustice & impatience as great if he be contened; for in God mercy and iustice are termed Gods two armes, & therefore must be of equall length and bignesse, as well in punishing the wicked, as pardoning the godly.
            
               
3. Sinne is a most odious and impudent aduersary to God, and to all his workes, prouoking his iustice in the highest degree, labouring to bring the Author of all Being, to a none being, and all his creatures with him, and therfore must God be reuenged vpon it, and his fauourites, as vpon the greatest enemies to his glory in the highest degree.
            4. This is Gods ordinance, that such as feare and obey him in this life should to heauen, and the others to hell: this is the principall condition of his gracious couenant, and therefore it must bee so.
            5. All transgressions against the Kings person, or bloud royal, are high treason, to be punished with the extreamest tormens as can be deuised, but the Reprobate sinne against the King of Kings in crucifying and killing his Sonne and heyre apparent within his owne Court, raigning 
               Heb. 10. 29 
               in heauen, and therefore no punishment is great enough for such as crucifie the Sonne of God to death, to say nothing, how they cōspire, with Satan to disturb

and persecute his Church to robbe the Lord of his honour and glory, and to bring all to confusion.
            6. A Reprobate is an heart-murtherer, of God himselfe, and a destroyer of all his ordinances, wishing there were no God, no Iudge, no heauen, no hell no resurrection nor life immortall, and therefore should be seuerely punished.
            7. The godly cry against them, and so doe their bloudy sinnes, and therfore Reuel. 9. 9. the r
                  •
               ghteous Iudge must doe i
                  •
               stice vpon them according to their demerits.
            8. In sinning there passeth through euery mans hart a practicke discourse of the vnderstanding, laying before the sinner as it were in the one scale of the ballance, the delight, ease, pleasure, or profithe reapes by sinning; and in the other, the wrath of God if he sinne, and hell torments with the losse of Gods fauour, kingdome, and all his goodnesse, which all in respect of his greedinesse to sinne, he renounceth, maketh a couenant with death and hell, and now is turned to it, and receiueth his owne madde choyce.
            
               
The next Vse then is for vs, not for Vse 4. lust and lustinesse in sinne, thus to set at naught the Lord and his regalities; for though this bee but the first degree to the paines of hell, and as it were the suburbs thereof, yet all the teares spent in hell are vnsufficient to bewaile the losse of Heauen, and of Gods presence, and yet we see millions preferre the losse of their least commodities before it; but they shall finde this a greater losse, when without delay they must, after the sentence denounced, trudge the black way to perdition (with many a deepe sigh, and comfortlesse sobbe) from God and all the company of heauen, to sup in that full hungly pallace of confusion vvith the Prince of darkenesse, and his accursed company, at the terrible table of Gods vengeance.
            The second point of the execution of the sentence of damnation, is the continuance 
               The secōd part of the cōtinuance of the torments vpon the reprobates. 
               of these paines in hell, which shall be for euer; And they shall goe into euerlasting paine, Math. 25. 46. and this sentence is most iust euery way, as decreed before all worlds, reuealed to the

world in all ages, and shall be executed Reasons why reprob
                     •
                  tes be punished eternally. in the end of the world, and that for these reasons.
            1. Because the hatred of the wicked to God and man is eternall, it must so long be punished.
            2. As man sinneth against his God, who is eternall and infinite, so iust it is that man should be punished eternally and infinitely. But (will you ask) might Obiect. not the Lord haue killed them out-right and there an end, and not suffer them to frie in torments eternally. Ans. No, for that had not satisfied his iustice. 2. Then the conditions of the couenant required eternity.
            The Vse then is for euery man to beware Vse. 1 of that prison, out of which hee shall neuer come forth, and to consider how long is that whipping that neuer endeth, tedious is that day that yeelds no euening, and hard goeth it with the tormented that would 
                  •
               aine die & cannot. If a damned person were perswaded that he were to sustain his torments in hell no more thousand yeeres then be starres in the skie, sands in the sea, grasse

pills vpon the ground, and creatures in heauen and earth, though this time would be past telling, yet would hee comfort himself in that one day, though it were long, the fire would bee quenched, the worme would die, the chaines of darkenesse would weare out, the prison would be layd open, and the miserable man should be set at liberty, but (alas) neuer to come forth, this word (neuer) killeth the heart, seeing the paines be intollerable, and the continuance eternall. If sinners would deepely and sadly consider this point, they would not buye repentance so deare, nor be so mad as for a moment of transitory delights, profits, or ease, boyle so long in a Lake burning vvith fire and brimstone▪ pittifull & fearfull it is to see how the fooles of the people in these dayes of light, make but a sport of sinne; not thinking how close, and of what endless continuance the prison shall bee there; and others more wife, yet not much more religious, packe vp all sinnes vpon Christs mercies, not regarding his iustice, nor their owne infidelity, much

lesse abnegation of themselues, and amendment of life, and yet there is not lightly any so foolish or sottish, if hee haue in hand any matter of importance among them, if specially thereupon his estate relieth, but will carefully before hand cast for it; yet in this (then which there is none more waighty) most men sleepe and snort, and what, saith the Iudge, shall in the end become of them, but that the Iudge will come when he looketh not for him, and hew him in peeces, and set him his portion with vnbeleeuers, Luke 12. 46. Thus farre of the execution of the Lords definitiue sentence vpon the Reprobate, namely, that they goe into euerlasting paine, and there I leaue them, where God leaueth them; for how can, or should I be more mercifull vnto them, then the most mercifull God is vnto them, 1. Sam. 28, 16. or then they themselues were to themselues whilest they liued here, and might haue easily preuented these tortures but would not, but contemned all admonitions.
            Next it followeth to speake of the

execution of the second part of the sentence The execution of the sentēce vpon the Elect. definitiue vpon the godly, which is thus; And the righteous (shall goe) into life eternall. But what these ioyes be, you must pardon mee, if I be sparing in Reasons why I speak sparingly of heauenly ioyes. the relating thereof; for our Sauiour Christ who came from heauen, discoursed very little thereof, though he could doe it best of any, nor yet Paul who was rapt into the third Heauen, 2. Cor. 12. 4. speake nothing heere of to any purpose, as not bin giuen himin commission, and also 2. for that the nature of these ioyes is transcendent, infinite, ineffable, incomprehensible, and remote from our weake senses, and vncapable capacities, and therefore being vnable to conceiue them, we are to beleeue life euerlasting. 3. When Christ himselfe, his Prophets, or Apostles go about to describe Christs spirituall kingdom, they vse wonderfull enlargings, surmounting and comparatiue speeches, taken cheefely of such things as the Tabernacle, Arke, and Temple were made of, to figure thereby to vs, the heauenly Tabernacle, and celestiall Ierusalem, and holy Temple, typing the

same by such things as men set most price by, as gold, siluer, pearles, precious stones, and the like; and yet when all is done, they come short of the ioyes themselues, and therefore the safest way is to bee wise with sobriety. 4. There be some mysteries in the word of God, the perfect and full manifestation wherof, the Lord reserueth for this due time and place, which is the life to come, whereof I take this to be one, and therefore let vs in hope expect that time and place, and not the while build Castles in the ayre. 5. We ought rather to labour and study to know & practice the means directing vs to heauen, then to trouble our selues on Seraphicall questions, nothing so necessary for vs. 6. I denie not but wee may discourse heereof, so farre as the candle of the word enlighteneth vs; and Paul prayeth that this mystery might bee reuealed vnto vs, Ephes. 1. 18. and vnthankefull to God should we be, and enemies to our comfort, if wee would refuse to search for, and to vnderstand what the Lord reuealeth, yet for my part, I had rather be

silent then erre heerein, and by my silence vvant a fault, then vvhen it is committed to craue pardon vvhen I needed not commit it; speciallie, seeing there bee diuers learned men that haue comfortably discoursed heereof, vvho out of the Word taught vs, that there is an Heauen, and therein ioyes vnspeakeable and glorious, that God himselfe is the Author ther

               of, that it is eternall, that the twelfth Article of our faith is thereupon grounded (and the very Pagans affirme the same) who they bee that shall enioy them, then, that the nature of these ioyes is priuatiue and positiue, the positiue internall and externall, &c. vnto whom I referre you as my selfe for satisfaction, if vve stand vnresolued, which we need not.

                these ioyes, serue for admonition to the godly to bee vvatchfull, lest hee loose the same, and vvith Satan drop to hell, and therefore must haue a care to lead reformed liues, to assure them of their saluation, else euery comfort wil be conuerted

to a sentence of condemnation: and what auaileth it thee to discourse of such an excellent country, whereunto thy conscience telleth thee thou hast no title vnto, no more then it doth Satan, who can speake more of heauen then any of vs; yet the thinking of that country much encreaseth his sorrow: and so will it be to the wicked in the midst of their iollities a sting in their soules, & as a tart sawce, making their sweetest melodies sowre & deadly. If this meditation were holpen with the light of a liuely faith, it would (as Elishaes salt) sweeten all the waters of Iericho; and as Elias fiery Chariot, soone lift vs vp to heauen, and the vvhile make al the bitter pains of this life comfortable to vs; for if the loue of Lands, and desire of Riches, cause the paines taken for them to seeme nothing; vvhat should the loue of Heauen effect in our soules? should vvee for this Countrey refuse any toyle? vvee know how all condemne Esau for selling his birth-right for a messe of redde pottage, and what are the very best things in this world,

but vanity and vexation of spirit, and God forbid wee should loose our birth-right in heauen for the loue of vncertaine pleasures: a wise pilgrime will forbeare all delights that hinder his return, and reserue all pleasures vntill hee come home, and so should we, else we will not come thither in haste. Abraham obeyed God, calling him out of his country, Heb. 11. 9. because he looked for a City, whose maker was God, and Paul vvas content to beare all afflictions, because hee looked for things that were not seene, 2. Cor. 4. 17. and 5. 1. 2. and vvhosoeuer assureth himselfe of heauen, will little regard this sinfull life, which one point should cause worldlings to looke about them.
            The second Vse serues for thankefulnesse Vse. 2. to our good God, for redeeming vs from hell, and all miseries, whereunto by our sinnes, and the sinnes of our sorefathers, we had wretchedly plunged our selues, and of his vnspeakeable loue and mercy made vs his elect children, & heyres of his kingdom; and if thou take this to be but a slender benefit, then cō

what a damned soule would giue, if he had wealth, to be thus freed; and do thou now the like, for by nature thou wast the childe of wrath as well as hee, Ephes. 2. 3. And therefore if Noah escaping the Deluge wherein millions were drowned, and Israell deliuered from Pharaohs tyranny, and Dauid from Saul, forgat not due thankefulnesse; much more ought wee, deliuered from the flouds of Gods wrath, tyranny of Sathan, and cruelty of all enemies, yea and from the euerlasting paines of hell, be euer thankefull in this, and the life to come for this most gracious deliuerance and blessed aduancement to his holy kingdome in heauen.
            The third Vse serues for comfort to Vse 3. Of the ioyes of heauen. the Elect which goe to euerlasting life, and to heauen, and that in three respects.
            1. Of the ends why eternall life was ordained: 1. that God might manifest the riches of his grace to his Elect: 2. that the godly might enioy the full fruits of Christs death, and the promised rewards of their labours and indignities in this life sustained: 3. that they might magnifie

the great vvorkes and mercies of God wrought for them.
            2. In regard of the effects of eternall life; 1. that they may be as the Angells of God, Math. 22. 30. not in substance, but in conditions: 2. that wee may be made partakers of the dignity of Christ in his three offices, as Kings, Priests, and Prophets, though not in the same excellency.
            3. In regard of certaine degrees of heauenly ioyes, vvhereof the first degree of our comfort and ioy, shall be in respect of the generall resurrection.
            1. For it shall bee a ioyfull day to vs. 1. For the Angells will awake and comfort vs in the Lord. 2. Ioyfull it shall be, for that our soules and bodies separated by death, shal now againe be ioyned together, and glorified together eternally. 3. Ioyfull shall it be in respect of the holy communion of Saints whereunto we shall be ioyned to praise the Lord.
            2. A second degree of glory will this he, that wee shall appeare before Christ our Sauiour, be absolued and sit vvith him to iudge the wicked, & enter vpon

his sweet promises of eternall life.
            3. A third degree of glory is, that he will iustifie and saue vs from our sinnes.
            4. The fourth degree of ioy is, in that wee shall be honoured with the dignity of Iudges.
            5. A fift degree is, after we haue thus triumphed and troden our enemies all vnder feet in most glorious and triumphant manner, we shall with Christ our head, and all his Angells and Saints, goe to life eternall, which is the end of all our wishes and desires, where for euer, we shall enioy the presence of the holy Trinity, where the inhabitants of the heauenly Ierusalem bee all Angells and Saints; for Nobility, all the Sonnes of God; for vnity, brethren; for wisedome and knowledge all taught of God; for experience, they al ouercame the world; for multitude they cannot be numbred; & for amity, they liue in cōtinuall peace; their work, praising & seruing the Lord; for piety, they keep a perpetual sabbath, euery day an holy day to the Lord.
            6. The 6. degree is in regard of our continuance in heauen, which is euerlasting

without end, but if these ioyes had had an end, then had it not been an heauen; but it is eternall, without end, greefe, wearinesse, oldage, or any corruption: for vvhen Death is swallowed vp in victory, how possibly can wee die, our Sauiour being life it selfe.
            7. The seauenth degree is, that the Lord will poure into our soules and bodies all the communicable graces of his Spirit; for when we are vnited to Christ our head, and then by vertue of this vnion and communion mysticall, wee be in all created gifts and graces belonging vnto all and euery part of our soules and bodies like him, but not in the same degree.
            8. The eight degree of ioy is, a freedome from all miseries whatsoeuer, belonging to body and soule, and in stead thereof be enriched with the contrary blessings, which the Lord grant vs. And thus farre of the thirteene Motiues for watchfulnesse against the day of iudgement, and of the timely vses wee are to make thereof. Sect. 20. The Conclusion.
            
            Hauing dwelt thus long vpon these

Motiues, I will now draw in my sailes, and hasten to the shore, exhorting euery man in the Lord, that as this triple watchfulnesse is necessary, and concerneth euery man that euery Christian particularly watch, and prepare himselfe accordingly; for while the arrows of the Lords wrath flie ouer euery mans head, and are not yet fallen, euery man may see and prouide for himselfe, and escape: were it proclaimed that for some priuy fault, onely known to himselfe, the King (whole life the Lord long preserue) would execcute in euery town some 100.

               0 or 10. persons, nay but two in euery towne, whom pleased him all would feare, and by all meanes labour to exempt and secure themselues, least he should be one of that number; but we know that the fewer number in euery Towne or Hamlet shall bee saued, Mat. 7. 22. 23. Luke 13. 23. 24. and euery mans conscience telleth him, that if the Lord should call him to iudgement vpon a sodaine, he should not be able to answere him one to a thousand, Iob 9. 3. and 40. 4. 5. and 42. 3. and that there is no

way but by carefull watchfulnesse to escape this doome, and yet our eyes for all this, are heauy for sleepe, as were the eleuen Apostles in their greatest danger, who could not watch one houre with Christ: or if a lying Wizard should foretell that Mat. 26. 40 of many, that passed that day ouer a bridge, one should drop ouer & drown, all the passengers would see carefully to their footing (though he were but a lier) but when the holy Ministers out of the infallible word of God, admonish them to watch, they heere mocke and say the daies are prolonged, but surely so dangerous a case admits no mocking; we shuld hastily see to our watch, and the rather, seeing our Sauior hath blown his trumpet, the day approcheth, the summons are sent forth, the sentence is drawn, and we all wait but for his glorious cōming to denounce it, & therfore the while let vs as good porters, watch at the gates of our soules, that Satan step not out to cast vs to the dead sleep of sin, or to steale vs from our selues: there is not any of vs but hath a secret watch within to giue him timely warning hereof, in euery thought

word, & action, we take in hand to tell vs that we for the presēt are liable to Gods temporal iudgment, & if we escape them not, we must doubtlesse die, and come to iudgement, and this is the watch of our consciences. Oh that we would regard it in time, & at euery stroke of the clocke, bewaile how little good to further our reckoning against death & iudgment we did that houre past! and that we would consider, that euery houre we are neerer and neerer to our end, which if we did sadly remember, we would not do amiss Many idle gentlemen for a brauery carry golden watches in their bosoms to warn them how their golden time passeth, & yet are the while neyther idle, nor well occupied, but no watch to this of thy Conscience, if vvee would listen vnto it, which runneth truely, as well by night as by day, and giueth vs a checke euery munute, neuer standing still, vnlesse it bee rusty, or choaked altogether with the filth of sinne, yet let vs know, that when iniquity hath played her part vpon the Theater of this sinfull vvorld, then vvill vengeance,

            Saue and protect vs (good Lord) from this Lake of misery, worke in vs speedily A prayer. true repentance, faith vnfeigned, with due obedience to all thy commandements, that so standing vpon our watch, and seruing thee euer in spirit & truth, wee may liue with thee euer in Heauen: and as Ambrose in his funerall Oration for Theodosius, supposeth that the Angells carrying his soule to heauen, should in the way aske him, what did he while hee liued heere vpon earth, and hee should answer, Dilexi: I haue loued: So we pray thee (O sweet Sauiour) both to prepare our selues while we be heere to liue before thee in all Christian watchfulnesse, and so likewise

for death and iudgement, & withall, to grant vs thy holy Spirit & grace, in such powerfull and aboundant manner, that when thy holy Angells shall gather vs from the foure windes to appeare before thy iudgement seat; and thou the great Arch-Angell shalt aske vs what we did all the while wee liued h
                  •
               ere, we may truly and cheerefully answere, both that we loued thee (O blessed Sauiour) aboue all and loued our neighbours as our selues, and withall, that we watched continually ouer our whole liues, and against death and thy comming to iudgement. O Lord grant vs this grace for thy great name sake. To thee deere Sauiour, with thy Father and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory giuen by vs, both now and for euer.
            Amen.

               GEntle Reader, although the Printer hath desired and vsed his best care, that this booke should come forth with fewest faults, yet by reason of the duskie obscurenesse of the hand, and absence of the Author dwelling farre off; it could not be, but some faults escaped vs, not o
