for prosperous building thereupon.
            
            
               More specially for all those of the inferiour
sort, and all ruder countries and places; namely,
for Ireland, Wales, Virginia, with the Sommer
Ilands, and for their more speedie attaining of our
English tongue by the same labour, that all
may speake one and the same
Language.

got in the Grammar Schooles; and to proceed aright
therein, for the perpetuall benefit of these our
Nations, and of the Churches
of Christ.

            ¶To the Right Honourable his
Maiesties Lord Deputy of Ireland,
and to the right Honourable the Lord President
and Lord Lieutenant of WALES, and the
Principalitie thereof, the Gouernours of the Iles
of GERNSEY and IERNSEY; and to the right
Honourable and right Worshipfull, the Treasurer,
Councell and Company for VIRGINIA, and of
the Sommer Ilands; and to all other Gouernours
within his Maiesties dominions, to whom the
charge and care of Schooles; namely, those of the
inferiour sort, are assigned: with all true fauourers of
good Learning, who vnfainedly wish the perpetuall
flourishing of the Church of God, and of their
natiue Countrey, I. B. wisheth all happinesse in
Christ eternally.
            
               AFter many thoughts to whom I
should more particularly dedicate
this my hoped Consolation, (right
Honourable able and right Worshipfull,)
the Lord in his wisedome
and mercie (I trust) directed me
vnto your selues, as those whom it doth in a peculiar
manner concerne. That like as he hath appointed you

to these places, so ye may euer haue before your eies, the
speciall ends for which he hath assigned them to your
trust, & for which you must be answerable to his heauenly
Maiesty. The first and chiefe whereof (as I conceiue)
is this, That his pure religion, honour, and true
worship, may be set vp, and aduaunced in them;
the next, that the wealth and sauing of all his poore
people in those places, both of their soules and bodies,
may be by you procured, so farre as in your power
shall lie. And these things to be effected principally,
by a learned, holie, and faithfull Ministerie, protected
and assisted by a godlie Magistracie, and by propagating
and spreading all good learning and knowledge
amongst them. To this purpose God hauing ordained
schooles of learning to be a principall meanes to reduce
a barbarous people to ciuilitie, and thereby to
prepare them the better to receiue the glorious Gospel
of Iesus Christ; as also for the breeding and
nourishing of such a holie Ministerie, with a wife and
godlie Magistracie, and people to be perpetuallie preserued;
your care as I take it, in the next place (that
I may speak with all reuerence and submission) ought
to be for prouision of meete schooles and Seminaries
for them, according to the natures and conditions of
the places, and as God shall raise vp meanes thereto.
And for those which are alreadie so prouided and established,

that the best orders may be knowne and
receiued, for the speediest aduancement of the best
learning in them, and for accomplishing all the good
thereby desired; and withall for supply of what priuate
helpes Gods goodnes shall vouchsafe, for breeding,
and nourishing, and also preseruing all true pietie
and grace amongst them.
            The benefit therefore and comfort of such small
mites, as his heauenlie bountie hath vouchsafed me,
which may be helpefull hereunto, I do most thankefully
and cheerefully, as from his goodnesse, tender
vnto you to this end; And more specially to you, right
Honour able and right Worshipfull the Gouernour,
Councell and Companie for Virginia, and of the
Sommer Ilands; that planting in a right order,
beginning with the Lord, and the carefull planting
and watering of his sacred Religion, you may finde
a more happie growth, and increase, and euermore
sound and lasting ioy to your owne soules. First, the
mite of my Schoole-labours trauelled in, now manie
yeares for all inferiour and ruder places, whereunto
what blessing his heauenlie bountie hath giuen, I
leaue to the iudgement of all true harted wel-willers
vnto good learning. Secondly, I desire to commend
vnto you, for them, and that vpon vndoubted experience,
the helpe, and benefit of another poore labour,

which he of his goodnes hath likewise granted
vnto me, namelie of a little Treatise called, The true
Watch, and Rule of Life: which hauing receiued
the witnesse of sundrie godlie learned, (of whom I
haue for manie yeares intreated the examining; and
censuring of it, after the publique authorizing thereof)
to be that waie of godlines, wherein we all who
truelie professe Christs Gospel do agree, and that
narrow path, in which all that walke conscionablie,
and carefullie, shall certainely finde eternall Life: I
dare be the more bold in 
                  ••
               tie to make tender of, for
the furtherance of their perpetuall comfort and felicitie.
And vnto the same adioyned the Rule of true
Prayer, the second part of the same True Watch;
wherein I haue followed, (so neare as I haue beene
able) the perfect patterne of our blessed Sauiour:
which two so conioyned, may be for directing priuately
euerie soule (which hath grace to vse them,
and to put them so in practise) as their Sea-card and
Compasse, to keepe them in the right course to their
intended Point; that they may not be carried ouer
farre, nor fall too short of their desired hauen; Yea
to performe that for them, which neither Card nor
Compasse can; to wit, that they may not onelie be k
                  •
               pt
from splitting; or dashing vpon the Rockes or Sands,
but that they may saile securelie amongst the most

dangerous rockes and perillous tempests. That arriuing
happily, they may likewise euer after be kep
                  •
               
safe, in the midst of all sauage and cruell enemies.
            And finally, what straits or miseries soeuer they
shall come into, either by Sea or land; that but onely
crying vnto the Lord, they may be graciously heard;
and mercifully deliuered in due time, according to that
which shalbe most for the glorie of his Maiestie
and their owne saluation, with the good of his people.
            Though the dedication and patronage of my
Schoole-labours belong vnto our most hopefull and
illustrious Prince, and so in like maner of my Watch
vnto most Honourable personages (to whom I am
euer bound) yet I know that the tender of the assured
benefit thereof, after so long triall in the right vse
and practise of them, euen vnto your Honours and
Worships, for these poore soules, and for your more
happie execution of your charge, will be most pleasing
vnto them, as who desire the wealth of all.
Yea (giue me leaue to speake iointlie and freelie, yet
in all humble duty vnto you all before mentioned, both
right Honourable and right Worshipfull) euen yee
are they to whom the charge of these poore Countries
and places are committed in speciall manner, and the
prouiding for them. If therefore you should not vse
all holie meanes for the honour of our God, with the

sauing and preseruing of all those soules, and their
posteritie, and gaining the verie sauage amongst
them vnto Iesus Christ, whether Irish or Indian,
but onelie respect your owne ends and proiects, you
could neuer stand before his heauenlie Maiestie, to
answere his Highnesse for it; especiallie, if hee most
graciouslie offering you helpes thereto, you should not
embrace them accordinglie, and to your vtmost abilitie
see them put in execution. You cannot be ignorant
of the wofull estate of all sorts, so long as they
remaine in ignorance and blindnesse, without the sauing
knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ, and much
more of all such, as haue bene nourished long in fearefull
superstition and Idolatrie: and aboue all other,
those who haue bene bred in a manifest, and most
palpable, and euen a visible adoring of Sathan; nor,
how the Holie Ghost hath told vs plainelie,2. Thes. 1. 8, 9 
               That our
Lord Iesus will come, in flaming fire to render
vengeance to all who know not God, and
which obey not his heauenly Gospell. Who
must then be punished with euerlasting perdition,
when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to
be made maruellous in all them that beleeue. Oh set
before your faces the miserable condition of the damned,
and so the danger of all liuing in blindnesse, whilst
they so remaine. If we beleeue the word of the Lord,

and looke stedfastlie with the eies of Faith, vpon
the wretched estate and wofull torment of that rich
Glutton in Hell (by whom our Sauiour fore-warneth
all sorts for euer) it will surely cause vs to looke vnto
our selues.Luke 16. 24. 
                     •
                  
                Or if we set before our eies the Lake prepared
for all the vngodlie,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                and where the bloud of
those soules must be required, if they perish for lacke
of warning or instruction. And finallie, if we consider
aright, That the righteous can scarcely be saued,
               1 Pet. 4. 18
as the Holie Ghost witnesseth most plainelie,
and we may see it by d
                  •
               ilie experience, (when as m
                  •
               
               nie
a good soule, which hath bene carefull to walke
with God, yet in distresse of conscience, and a little
left to Sathans buffe
                  •
               tings, for their humbling, endure
such miserie, and is so hardly rescued from
him and from vtter destruction) it will surely awake
vs all to looke more carefully to all committed to our
charges. Yee are those whom our blessed God hath
appointed; vnder our dread and gracious Soueraigne
to be as foster-fathers vnto them, and therefore it
concernes you neerelie, to thinke seriouslie hereof;
for if that way of godlinesse, which we professe according
to the word of the Lord and our good Lawes
(which I haue long endeuoured to set plainely before,
our faces, in that little Tr
                  •
               atise, the vse and benefit
whereof I desire to commend vnto you for them) be

that narrow way of life, as wee are assured from
the mouth of the Lord it is; then their contrary courses
must needes be the way of death and hell. Though
therefore, wee should haue no commiseration of the
poore soules themselues, yet remember the things
that may concerne your owne blessed estate and posteritie,
and your ioyfull appearing before the high
Tribunall of our Lord and Sauiour, and then there
will be no more need to mooue you therein, nor anie
other whom the charge of soules concernes, who shall
consider hereof aright, to do your vtmost endeuour
for their saluation. There will be no more need to call
on you to see the gospel of Christ planted among them,
or to prouide them of faithfull Ministers, and to procure
by all possible meanes all other helps, or that, that
which hath bene most charitablie giuen, and formerlie
collected to these ends, may be rightlie employed,
and whatsoeuer else the Lord shall hereafter affoord
for their benefit, chieflie to bring them into and keep
them in this narrow path. Wofull is the case of all
those, amongst whom Sathan reignes, and who worship
him instead of Christ, as all such do, who know
him not, and much more those poore Indians, among
whom he (as is reported) is visibly adored & sacrificed
vnto, as their God. Maruell not if honest and
vnderstanding Christians be so hardly drawne ouer

to these places, as namely into Virginia, or so much
as to perswade their friends to such a voyage, when
as there are in the same so manifold perils, and especially
of falling away from God to Sathan, and that
themselues, or their posterity should become vtterly
sauage, as they are. This holy care being first had,
for their soules and eternall happinesse; and withall,
that there be no wrong offered to the poore sauage
there, nor scand all giuen to them, there may be a
greater hope of a happy Plantation, and that he will
in mercy afford a plentifull supply of all good things,
and raise vp many to be benefactors and furtherers,
and giue a prosperous successe to all your holy endeuours,
with assurance of his fauour present, and for
euermore. But if thorough the wickednes or offensiue
carriage ef Ministers or people, minding nothing
but for their owne aduantage, these poore soules shall
take occasion to conceiue euill of the Lord, and his religion,
all this hope is vtterly ouerthrowne, in the
very hauen.
            Here upon in my desire of their conuersion and saluation,
with the sauing and preseruation of our owne
countrie-men there alreadie, and which hereafter
shall go to them, and of all other in these ruder countries
and places, I haue bene bold to tender these my
poore trauels, vpon much hope and confidence: That

first euen this course of instruction, to be presented
vnto you, being embraced and rightly put in practise,
a most speedy and sure foundation, may be layd for all
future good learning, in their schooles, without any
difference at all from our courses receiued here at
home; and whereby both Maisters and Scholars, may
proceed speedily, and cheerefully, and with certaine
assurance of a blessing; and that so from vs may be
sent continu
                  •
               ll supplies of teachers to proceed in the
same order. The triall whereof I dare (through Gods
goodnesse) tender to any by your selu
                  •
               s appointed to
m
                  •
               ke full demonstration of it to them, like as I haue
formerly done to the most learned and fit that I could
chuse to this purpose, as appeareth in the Examiners
ce
                  •
               sure, in the closing vp of this little Treatise.
And withal, to help that we may haue by the same, not
onely the puritie of our owne language preserued amongst
all our owne people th
                  •
               re, but also that it may
be readily learned in the Schooles, together with the
Latin, and other tongues, and so more propagated to
the rudest Welch and Irish, yea to the very heathen
& sauage, brought vp amongst them, the more easily
thereby to reduce them all (as was said) to a louing
ciuility, with loyall and faithfull obedience to our Soueraigne,
and good Lawes, and to prepare a way to
pull them from the power and seruice of Sathan, that

they may ioyntly submit themselues to Iesus Christ.
            And for the Watch, being agreeable to the word
of the Lord, as I trust euery one that tries aright shal
find it, I dare boldly a vow, that euery soule that shall
truely put in practise, first that Rule and Way of
life to walke in it, shall find more true comfort by it,
then by all the commodities in Virginia, yea more
true ioy, with all heauenly riches and felicity, then
all the golden mines of the Indians can possibly promise
vnto them. Secondly, for that Rule of Praier
in the same, that euery one who shall learne to exercise
it, as the Lord Iesus hath taught him, shall obtaine
whatsoeuer good thing his soule shall desire:
and finally, that so watching and praying, he shall be
kept safe, euen in the midst of Diuels and ten thousand
other perils, and haue the Lord to be vnto him,
as he was to Abraham, God all-sufficient, whither
soeuer he calleth him, to be seene of him in the Mount,
and the inheritance of Abraham, to him and his, so
walking, for an euer lasting possession.
            Thus haue I presumed to tender vnto you (right
Honourable and right Worshipfull) whatsoeuer the
Lord hath vouchsafed me, whereof I haue had hope,
that it might help you in your gouernments and charges,
for the good of those poore people committed to
you, and specially which might further the happy successe

of that so much desired Plantation, for the conuersion
of the heathen, and training them vp in good
learning, and the feare of the Lord, and that so from
the children, it may please God more easily to deriue
the same vnto their fathers, from the younger to the
ancients; and so in time, by some of themselues so trained
vp, to propagate it to all their posterity: which
(if after further triall made by you) it shal be as curteously
accepted, as it is heartily and cheerefully offered,
according to that which I haue receiued from
the Lord, I shall not onely haue more cause to blesse
his heauenly Maiestie, but also be encouraged still to
prosecute these poore trauels, and to study the further
good of them all during life, especially for drawing
the poore natiues in Virginia, and all other of
the rest of the rude and barbarous from Sathan to
God, and so rest,
            
               Yours in all humble obseruance
and hearty prayer to God
for you,
IOHN BRINSLEY.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A CONSOLATION FOR
OVR GRAMMAR SCHOOLES.
            
               THE vncomfortable and fruitlesse
toyles,Occasion of this worke. which the Lord hath left vnto
men, to humble them thereby,
haue euer caused many to bēd their
wits and beate their braines, to find
out more plaine and profitable
wayes, both to rel
                  •
               eue themselues,
and to make their burdens more light. Amongst others,
my selfe hauing first had long experience of the manifold
euils which grow from the ignorance of a right order
of teaching, and afterwards some gracious tast of the
sweetnesse that is to be found in the better courses truly
knowne and practised, I haue betaken me almost
wholly, for manie yeares, vnto this weightie worke, and
that not without much comfort, through the goodnesse
of our blessed God. And thence the more earnestly haue
I pursued this same, for that I haue bene fully perswaded
vpon happie experience (I trust) that I could neuer employ
my thoughts and trauels more acceptably in anie
earthly thing, or whereby a greater benefite might redound
both to Church and Commonwealth, and in
some sort to euery soule, then in searching out, and setting
forth to the view of all, the shortest, surest, and most
easie entrance to all good learning, and how with certaine
hope of good successe all may proceed therein.
            Who knowes not the grieuous complaints, which

(to the disgrace of learning) are made almost in euerie
place,The vsuall complaints against nonproficiencie in schooles. for the iniuries done to countries, townes, parents
and children; because in so manie schooles, the
children, which are the chiefe hope of parents and posteritie,
are either spoiled altogether, or else do profite so
verie litle?Where good is done, how hardly it is effected commonly. And for the most part, wherein any good is
done, that it is ordinarily effected by the endlesse vexation
of the painfull Maisters, the extreme labour and 
                  •
               errour
of the poore scholars, with enduring far ouermuch
and long seueritie. Now whence proceedeth all this, but
because so few of those who vndertake this function,A chief cause hereof, want of knowledge of a right course of teaching. are
acquainted with anie good method, or right order of
instruction, fit for a Grammer schoole? This therefore
hath bene in my heart, to shew my loue and dutie to all
sorts, in seeking for my part to deliuer the poore, painfull
& honest minded Schoolemaister from this reproch
and griefe,The authors desire to help all this. and to helpe withall to supply this so great a
want. And in stead hereof my earnest desire hath bene to
procure a perpetuall benefite to all estates and degrees,And to procure a perpetuall benefite to all posteritie.
euen to euery man for his children and posteritie; by endeuoring
to make the path to all good learning more euen
and pleasing in the first entrance, then former ages
haue knowne; and thereby also in the continuall proceeding
afterwards, so farre as the Lord shall vouchsafe me
his mercifull assistance in this great attempt. That children
being so entred in a plaine manner, may striue towards
the goale with vndoubted certaintie of obtaining
their desire, with pleasant delight and chearefulnesse
throughout all their time.
            Concerning the singular benefits and blessings which
come by good learning,Of the rare benefits of learning no good man euer doubted like as to euery particular soule,
and so to whole nations, no man truly wise did euer yet
make doubt. No not anie one who hath knowne aright

what learning meant; or who vnfainedly loued his coū
               trey,
the soules of Gods people, or the Gospel of Christ.
For what maketh a nation to be a glorious nation, but
that the people are a wise and an vnderstanding people?
What is it whereby we come so neare vnto the Highest,
or to that blessed estate from which by our first parents
we are so fallen, and to which we must be renewed and
restored, if euer we shall inherit againe the tree of life, as
by true vnderstanding and knowledge, especially if the
same be sanctified vnto vs? Yea, what is it else whereby
we excell the beastes, but by this diuine reason, with
which the more we are enlightened by the spirit of the
Lord, through the meanes of learning, the more we differ,
the more we do excell? Or who is he that can giue
God that glorie for which he was created, and redeemed
from hell, or can in anie measure honour him as he
ought to do, to his owne saluation, but onely he who is
endued with right knowledge and vnderstanding? Contrarily,
whence is that inhumanitie, as amongst manie
of the Irish, the Virgineans, and all other barbarous nations,
but frō their extreme ignorance of our holy God,
and of all true and good learning?
            If anie man should dislike of learning,The licenciousnesse of some learned or abusers of learning, ought not to cause vs to thinke the worse therof. or thinke that
there is ouer-much of it, for the strange licentiousnesse
and outragious courses of sundrie learned ones, or for
that so manie do abuse their learning, euen to their own
perdition, without vnfained repentance; why doth not
the same man dislike also of the light, yea of riches, honours,
and pleasures, all which are abused commonly by
the selfe same men, as they haue occasion, as much as
learning is? Good learning is indeed the heauenly light,
the truest honour, the best riches, the sweetest pleasure.
Learning is all, and all in all, if we beleeue that wise Salomon,
               
or anie of the graue Sages who haue euer liued
since the beginning of the world. Neither is the learning
of these men the cause of their licentiousnesse, but
this is it in truth; either that being left vnto themselues,
to humble them thereby, they haue put out that light of
learning which checked and controlled them, and haue
chosen, in their courses, to liue in darknesse rather then
in the light; or for that God hath therfore in his heauie
displeausre and most iust iudgement (as we are to feare
of manie of them) giuen them vp to such palpable blindnesse
in the midst of the shining light of this last age, because
they loued darknesse rather then the light,
               Iob. 3. 19. 2. Thes. 2. 10. or at least
for that they receiued not the loue of the truth, that they
might be saued.
            
            But wholly to conuince all sorts,Learning is the glorie of man, in the verie naturall mans account that learning is the
true light, and that principall part of mans glorie; let any
naturall man aske of his owne heart, whether if he would
haue his child brought vp to make a worthie man, he
would not haue him trained vp in the most excellent
learning, notwithstanding all the abuses of it, and whatsoeuer
can be deuised against it. And why should anie
one who knoweth but the law of nature, much more the
diuine law of our holy God, (that whatsoeuer we would
that men should do to vs euen so we should do to them) once
grudge or disdaine that vnto others, which of all other
things he most desireth for himselfe & his? Why should
he not as well repine against them for the vse of light,
seeing the Lord in his rich bountie, in like maner granteth
the light of true learning to be communicated to euerie
one, chiefly for his soule, as he shall be capable, as
well as he hath the light of the day for the bodie; and also
hath charged all most strictly, to seeke after it aboue all
other things. According to that of Salomon: Wisedome is

the principall thing,
               Prou. 4. 7. therefore get wisedome, and with all
thy getting get vnderstanding. Exalt her, a
                     •
                  d she shall promote
thee, she shall bring thee to honour when thou doest embrace
her. Wisedome is that one thing without which a
man is not in truth a man, nor can euer honour his Creator
as he ought.
            Yet to passe ouer this point, as not so needfull (I hope)
amongst vs, especially the true professors of Christs glorious
Gospell; whereof neuer anie one was a sound fauourer,
who was not likewise an earnest furtherer of the
best learning: & contrarily, they onely who haue sought
the ruine of the Church, as Iulian, haue sought (cunningly
at least, and vnder other faire pretences) the shutting
vp of the schoole dores, and the bringing of all good
learning into open contempt or base esteeme. And the
rather do I represse my selfe herein, for that this point
hath bene so worthily handled and cleared by some of
high place now sundrie yeares agoe, and all obiectours
put to silence.
            To ret
                  •
               rne therefore towards our proposed marke,The first and principall meanes of good learning, the schooles of learning.
& to consider of the meanes whereby the Lord bestowes
this heauenly gift of all true knowledge and good learning;
is not the first and principall the right education
of children in the Grammer schooles, which God hath
ordained to be his nurseries of all learning and vertue?
In verie many of which schooles abroad the contrarie
rudenesse is notwithstanding verie much to be pitied
and layed to heart of all; like as it hath bene long, and is
at this day too generally complained of, and that to be
feared not without iust cause.In what schooles the best learning & nurture are to be found. Of which sort are all those
wherein the schollers are so brought vp, as that they are
made more vnfit for anie calling, or so much as to take
paines in anie profitable employment. But these true

nurseries are onely such, wherein learned Maisters and
Vshers, being incouraged with meete maintenance and
due rewards, do follow the best & most approued courses,A wonderfull differēce betweene those scholes wherin the best orders are obserued, & the rest.
labouring constantly to put the same in vre. For in
these a wonderfull difference will appeare, when they are
compared with those other, in which the right meanes
and orders are litle knowne, and lesse regarded to be put
in practise.
            And first to begin with the matter of learning,1. The matter of learning easie in such schooles. which
ordinarily and in it selfe, through our naturall blindnesse
and dulnesse is so hard and vnpleasant; it is made in these
schooles most easie, and replenished with all sweete delight.
            Secondly for the manner of proceeding,2. The maner of proceeding in a singular order without confusion. it is in these
schooles so direct and orderly, to the verie highest top
of all perfection in the same, that the things taught before
do euer giue light to those that follow after; and the
later do so hang vpon the former, as that they haue a
continuall dependance, and also the scholars haue a continuall
helpe and vse of all those things which they haue
learned before. There is moreouer in them a very comely
array, as in a well gouerned armie, each knowing his
owne ranke and office,The painefull schoolmaster may there expect a rich blessing. without the least disorder or confusion.
Whereupon the painfull Schoolemaister may,
through Gods blessing, as certainly expect much comfortable
fruit of his labours, as anie other man in all the
world. That euen as the best husbandrie bringeth forth
vsually the greatest increase, the shortest and safest cut
in nauigation, doth fetch in soonest the double gaine; so
the shortest and fairest way of teaching, shall bring in
speedily double learning without anie losse or danger.
So as it must needs be great follie to go further about
with more trouble and perill, where a shorter and more

sure line is plainly directed and pointed out vpon infallible
experience.
            But for the fruits hereof they will be found such,The fruite hereof able to encourage each Maister to take the vttermost paines to follow the best manner. as are
able to allure and encourage euerie one, to take the vttermost
paines to seek out & to practise the best meanes
which euer God shall afford. For in the meaner schooles
will soone appeare such a change, from raw and rude behauiour,
vnto all commendable qualities, as if they had
bene cast in a new mould.Hence wil ensue a maruellous chāge in schooles. So that verie children will begin
to vnderstand, write, speake, oppose and answer, and
in all thinges so to demeane themselues, as to gaine
the hearts of all who shall rightly make triall, and
compare them with most others.The bringing learning into esteeme, and to make it to be desired, & honored of al▪
                Whence it must needs
follow, that whereas learning is now commonly so
basely reputed of, and so few in the countries abroad
regard to set their children to it; yet if the best courses
were in vse, euerie one would desire to haue his brought
vp in some learning and nurture,The stirring vp many benefactors to learning. and all of the better sort
and qualitie should be prouoked to become benefactors
to schooles, to augment their maintenance and encouragements
for the nourishing & increasing of the same.Things accompanying a right course in proceeding.
            
            These things likewise will certainly accompanie such
a right order of proceeding; both a maruellous freedome
of the Maisters from their wearinesse and discontent,Deliuery of the maisters from much vexation and ouermuch seueritie. Of scholars from terrour.
and from that ouer-great seueritie which they are
enforced to exercise, or else to do litle good; and withall
a ioyfull deliuering of the poore children from that continuall
feare, whereby in manie schooles, the greatest
part haue bene wont to be exceedingly dulled and to be
made most vnwilling to their bookes.That all things in schooles may be done with delight and comfort. That now contrarily
Maisters may teach with much delight and comfort,
and scholars learne with an ingenuous emulation, like
as they recreate themselues in their ordinarie sports. And

for the time spent in getting learning,More substantiall learning in such at 7. yeares▪ then in others atten. assuredly more
true, sound, and substantiall learning will be found to be
gotten in such places in seuen yeares, then is in others
commonly in seuen and halfe seuen. For this is a thing
notorious,State of most schooles and scholars of 15. yeares of age. that in the greatest part of our common
schooles abroad, (some few of principall note excepted)
the scholars at fifteene or sixteene yeares of age,
haue not commonly so much as anie sense of the meaning
and true vse of learning, for vnderstanding, resoluing,
writing, or speaking, but onely to construe and to
parse a little, to steale an exercise, and to write such Latine
as anie of iudgement will disdaine to reade.Vnfit for the Vniuersities. That in
respect of being fit to be sent to the Vniuersities with
credit, that they may proceed with delight and vnderstanding,
when they come there, they are commonly so
senslesse, as that they are much meeter to be sent home
againe. And if they be admitted into the Vniuersities, it
is not without the griefe of all who respect the credite
thereof.Euils in their entrance and continuance in the Vniuersities. So as that they enter commonly with fowle disgrace,
and continue with much contempt, to spend their
friends monie & their owne precious time, which might
haue bene farre better employed. That they become
there a great deale more readie to anie kinde of exercise
then vnto the studie of good learning, the ignorance
whereof proues such a reproach vnto them. Hence also
after sundrie yeares so euilly spent, manie of them return
home againe, almost as rude as they went thither, or are
sent abroad to be vnprofitable burdens, both of the
Church and Common-wealth perpetually. Or if such
do light into the hands of painfull and conscionable Tutors,Tutors must playe the schoolmasters if euer they shall do good.
and fall to their studies, yet their Tutors must then
act for them the School-maisters part, which must needs
be verie harsh and vnpleasing, yea rare to be found

amongst them. So that in stead of their Academicall
readings, they must be enforced to supplie that which
was wanting in the Grammar schoole.Such scholars must vse extraordinarie paines. Such schollars
must likewise vse extraordinarie paines and industrie, and
be of most happie capacities, if euer they shall come to
that pitch and height of good learning, which being
trained vp rightly from the beginning, they might verie
easily and in shorter time haue attained vnto.
            Hereof the complaints of the worthiest and most carefull
Tutors in the Vniuersities giue too sufficient testimonie.And doing best, shall yet euer feele the want of the Grammar schoole.
And though such scholars proue neuer so well,
yet shall they feele the want of the Grammar schoole all
their life long. But to leaue the Vniuersitie a litle, and
to returne to our schooles againe for the gracing of thē.
Whereas now in sundrie of them, yea some which are
of good maintenance, there are to be found some few
like vnprofitable drones, not by the vnaptnesse of nature,
but for lacke of better guidance and education;
then contrarily should we haue all such schooles generally,
as the litle bee-hiues,If the best orders were had the schooles should be as the bee-hiues euerie one in his owne cell,
and each knowing his owne taske, and all gathering
iointly to fill the hiues with the most excellent life honie.
So that tast wheresoeuer you pleased, you might euer
find most sweete contentment; if thus the best courses
were alike made known to all, and care had that they
might be constantly put in practise euerie where. Yea
then it would come to passe, that whereas now there is
litle or nothing in verie manie of them, wherein the eye
or eare can take delight, but rather those who come to
make triall haue enough at the first, and euer take iust
cause of griefe, that there should be such lamentable
spoiling of so manie toward youths, so wretchlesse misspending
of their golden age, with such inualuable and

irrecouerable losse and iniurie to all,As the goodly gardens & sweet singing birds. yet in short time we
should see the same as the goodly gardens, & as amongst
the litle singing birds, in the flourishing Spring; where
we still looke and hearken after more sweete varietie of
pleasant flowers,And generally excell thē
                  selues. and of melodious tunes. Then should
we find by ioyfull experience, that each meane schoole
would 
                  •
               ot onely excell it selfe, but be equall to manie of
chiefer note. And as much as the goodliest garden doth
excell the place ouer growne with briars and nettles, the
litle bee-hiues the nests of drones, so much should these
each way surpasse those same which now they are.That wee should as much reioice in these, as euer we grieued for the other. That
as we haue bene grieued formerly for the one, we should
be rapt with admiration of the other, and thinke all our
paines and cost farre too litle to be bestowed vpon them.
Maisters should be much more encouraged to go on
with cheerefulnesse, in seeing Gods blessing vpon their
labours, and by hearing the due commendations giuen
to their scholars, then by anie other rewards whatsoeuer.
The children should euer likewise haue their emulation
increased,Maisters and schollars should proceed with all alacritie. which of them all should most excell. And to
conclude this point, hence it should come to passe, that
although all could not be expected to excell in learning,Though all should not excell, yet all should be fitted to some good emploiment, for the benefit of the whole.
(for then should we be left destitute of husbandmen to
till the ground, and much more of meete supplies to furnish
all other callings; neither is it possible, by all the
meanes or paines in the world, to make such to be scholars,
to whom God in their naturall co
                  •
               stitution seemeth
to haue denied it; chiefly where parents or teachers thē
               selues
are too indulgent or remisse: so that their children
are disobedient, much absent from schoole, come and
go at their pleasures, neglect their exercises or the like, or
haue bene spoiled by ill entrance at the first,) yet these
things would follow through a right and carefull gouernment.

That a good part would be found in euerie forme
to credit the schoole: some to store the Vniuersities, others
to adorne all other places and conditions of life;
that thereby might be had men expert in each kinde as
necessitie should require, for the common benefite and
good of all.All these ve
                  
                     •
                  ied in some few schooles. All these things we may see verified in some
few and rare schooles, by comparing of which with most
others, and so by considering what a difference there is
(onely through the better courses practised constantly
in them,) we may fully iudge of the truth of all that hath
bene said, and most necessarily be enforced to subscribe
thereto.
            Vpon the due consideration hereof,This endeuor to di
                     •
                  charge a debt to all, by making all sorts partakers of the blessings, which he hath vouchsafed. and vpon much
and loug experience of diuerse places, together with the
certaine assurance of these and the like vndoubted benefites,
which must needes ensue generally vpon the best
courses of learning and good education, first diligently
sought out amongst all, and then diuulged for the publike
good, to be put in practise, I haue presumed to endeuour
to my poore abilitie, as the Lord hath vouchsafed
me mercie, to make all sorts partakers of this blessing,
and thus to be paying my debts to all, in communicating
the same vnto them.
            This trauell therefore hath bene,Dutie to all in high place for their children and posteritie. and is my dutie and
seruice, first vnto you all (ye worthies of the chiefest
ranke) who are vnfained fauourers of good learning, and
more especially to you to whom the Lord hath engaged
me and mine; yea my heartie wish (with all thankfull acknowledgement)
towards you, in your children, and
posteritie, in whom you are to remaine after your departing
hence, & by whom you would haue your names
and dignities still preserued euen in the earth. That they
may with sporting, in a pleasant kind of recreation, attaine

vnto that heauenly gift of learning, and excell all
others therein, according to their places and degrees.
And that hereby they may adorne your houses, increase
their owne honour in euerie kinde, to become principall
lights, and pillars of their countrey, and not to liue to
the ouerthrow, or the dishonour of your houses, and
names, much lesse to the euil example, or to the spoiling
of the poore people amongst whom they dwell, as those
who leaue their names for a curse behind them.
            It hath bene and is my debt,Desire to all parents. and true desire to all parents,
to further their comfort in their beloued children,
that they may see before their eyes their childrens forwardnesse
in learning and vertue, which may be vnto
them some recompence, of all their loue, care, and cost.
And also that being hereby encouraged to bring them
vp vertuously, they may alwayes haue the testimonie of
a good conscience, to cause them to reioice, in that they
haue had this first care to prouide them this portion.
Hereby they may depart hence with gladnesse, when
they may leaue those in their places, in whom they may
see iust hope, that they shall liue still in the earth with
worthie reputation.
            And in more especiall manner hath it bene my studie
for all such who in their naturall and tender affection,To all more tender hearted parents.
would haue their children brought vp in the most louing
and gentle manner, as it were in playing, and with
ingenuous strife and emulation, without that sharpnesse
which they cannot endure, so much as once to heare of.
            Yea to all likewise of the meaner sort,Wel-wishing to the poorer sort. that euen their
children may the more easily attaine vnto learning, that
so some of them being aduanced thereby, may become
a stay to their parents, a comfort to their kinsfolkes, a
credit to their countrey which brought them vp.
            
               
And to come vnto our Schooles,To the schooles thē
                  selues. for whose comfort
I haue chiefly spent my strength, it is my loue vnto you
all, that you may be such fertile Seminaries, of the best
instruction and nurture, as to replenish all places and callings.
Such as from which all crueltie and terrour may be
driuen farre away; that you may be Ludi literarij, truly
so termed; when the Maisters may teach with delight,
and scholars learne with delight: yea when the greatest
delight and comfort may follow in the end, in reaping,
and enioying the fruit of all your trauels. When as the
meaner schooles may be either equall, or at least come
neare to those of greater name, & the chiefe may seeme
as litle Colledges, euerie yeare sending forth their new
supplies, vnto our renowned Vniuersities, our Innes of
Court, and to all other places of principall note; not
onely to match our aduersaries herein, but also to surpasse
them in that, wherein they haue sought to gaine
the chiefest credit, & to giue our Church the sorest blow.
            It is the debt of my loue,To the Vniuersities. and token likewise of my
thankfulnesse to you, famous Vniuersities, by endeuouring
that ye may be replenished with the choisest plants,
when Tutors may be wholly employed as Tutors ought
to be, that so you likewise proceeding in the best courses
after, may euer flourish more and more, in all the liberall
and worthie Arts, adorned with the sweetest Rhetoricians,
the sharpest Logicians, most acute and wise Philosophers,
skilfull Physitians, holy and great learned Diuines;
for beautifying and fully furnishing the sacred Ministerie,Loue to all who haue lost their learning to repaire it, and recouer them selues.
to your eternall praise and commendation, and to
the euerlasting glorie of Christ.
            My loue to you who haue mis-spent your time, and
estate in vnprofitable courses, which will be bitter vnto
you in the end, and who know not how to employ your

selues or your talents. That hereby you may retire your
selues in time, and not onely recouer in a few moneths,
that which you haue formerly got in schooles, and now
haue lost, (as experience warrenteth you may in good
sort) but that you may moreouer grow on forward in
the konwledge of good learning, to become at length
some way profitable to the Church of God, and your
countrey which bred you. That at least you may betake
your selues, if not to the more fruitfull reading of the
sacred story with other learned works helping thereunto,
to your eternall saluation; yet to the diligent studie
of the famous and ancient Grecian or Roman history, &
their noble warres; to helpe the better to preserue, and
defend your natiue countrey; or for the succour of the
distressed parts of Gods true Church, and the poore
members of Christ against that Roman Antichrist, as
you now see the Lord to neede your helpe, and call you
forth thereto. That thus you may receiue comfort to
your owne soules, of the pardon of your former courses,
and of the Lords fauour, when you shall walke with him
in some profitable calling: which otherwise I can neuer
see how you can attaine vnto, but that you shall find the
flashing of h
                  •
               ll within you, when your consciences shall
be once thoroughly awakened, to consider seriously
how vnprofitable you haue bene; and of that fearefull
doome denounced against the vnprofitable seruant: Cast
that vnprofitable seruant into vtter darknesse,
               Matth. 25. 
               where shall
be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This will surely be executed
vpon you without your vnfained repentance, and
laying liuely hold on the Lord Iesus Christ.
            Finally it hath bene,Desi
                     •
                  e to all functions. and is mine vnfained desire to all
functions and places, and more particularly to euerie
ruder place, as to the ignorant countrie of Wales, and

more especially that poore Irish nation,To all ruder places, as to Wales, to the Irish, Virgi
                  
                     •
                  ia the Sommerlland
                     •
                  . with our louing
countrie-men of Virginia, or where euer else, if it might
please the Lord to cause the light to breake forth vpon
them, which now fit in such palpable darknesse, and in
the shadow of death, and wholy vnder the slauerie of
Satan. To the end to make the way of knowledge more
easie vnto them, not onely to the attaining of the Latine
tongue, but also that hereby they may much more easily
learne our English tongue, to helpe to reduce the barbarous
to more ciuilitie, and so to plant Gods true religion
there, that Iesus Christ may reigne amongst them,
Sathans kingdome fall, and they saued eternally, if the
Lord vouchsafe them that mercie.
            To this purpose I cannot but oft thinke of the speech
of a worthy learned man whom Cambridge in his time
much reuerenced,Maister Iohn Ireton of Legworth in Leicestershire. who hauing laboured many yeares
with little fruite, amongst a blinde, and superstitious
people, was wont much to lament, that he was enforced
to labour in a barren soyle where salt had bene sowen:
whence he vsed to affirme that the chiefe hope of Gods
church for all such pleaces so nuzled vp in rudenesse and
superstition, was to come out of our Grammar schooles.
And indeede for bringing men vnto ciuility, the very
heathens saw this to be the onely way, according to these
verses of the Poet, which are familiar to euery child.
            
               Adde quod ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes
               Emollit mores,Ouid. nec sinit esse feros.
            
            
               Right learning of ingenuous Arts,
               The sauage frames to ciuill parts.
            
            This was one chiefe cause that all the wisest among them
did so much prefer, and euer so aduance learning, and
learned men.
            To shut vp this point;Discharge of debt to all. this (I trust) shall bring a

blessing in due time to euerie one, when this way of attaining
to learning, shall become so plaine and direct,
as that each poore mans child may with a litle cost and
labour get some vnderstanding, to know how to serue
the high God, and his owne necessary occasions: and
that the children, and posteritie of those, may come
to the knowledge of the truth, who themselues haue liued
in most grosse ignorance, and extreame blindnesse.
By the meanes hereof euery one shall be the better enabled
to pay that debt,That euerie one may pay the debt of his birth. which by his very birth he oweth
vnto the Lord, and to his natiue countrey.
            For we are none of vs borne vnto our selues,For that none of vs are born to our selues. but as the
heathen Oratour could say, Our countrey doth challenge
a part (of our life & seruice,) our parents a part, our freinds
a part, &c. So that all the course of the life of euery one
of vs should be bent, to the faithfull discharge of this our
debt: so to leaue to posterity a thankfull remembrance
of our well deseruing of them. If the heathens professed
this, how much more should we Christians oft bethinke
our selues, how much we owe not onely to our countrey,
& to the Church of God in generall, but euen to euery
particular soule, and more specially to those whom
he hath linked vs to by nearer bonds. And to this end
ought each of vs to seeke, as he offereth opportunity, to
be alwayes paying this debt of ours; which none are
likely to discharge, so well as they, who haue bene best
instructed in their youth.
            Hereupon there shall neuer be wanting many cheerefull
aduancers of all good learning,Learning being in reputation, shall neuer want multitudes of benefactors. from which so many
blessings do proceed, especially when learning shall
come into the right estimation. This also shall be the
chiefest glorie of all such in the earth, to haue bene benefactours
and furtherers vnto the best learning and true

pietie, and likewise a notable euidence of the eternall
happinesse prepared for them.
            To this purpose if that heathen Orator could likewise
say further,The chiefest glory in earth to be aduancers o
                     •
                   learning & piety. euen by the light of nature: That to all
who haue preserued, helped, or any way augmented
the happinesse of their countrey, there is a most certaine
place ordained in the heauens, where they shall enioy
eternall happinesse; how much more boldly may we
Christians auouch the same, vpon certaine grounds out
of the word of God: That there is indeed a place of euerlasting
happinesse, and glorie prepared for all those, who
in witnesse of their loue & thankfulnesse to Iesus Christ,
and to their countries, shall employ their studies, and
their wealth, to the greatest aduancement of all heauenly
learning, and vnto the vertuous education of youth,
the hope of the succeeding ages?
            Finally,The glorie of our nation shalbe increased as learning increaseth. from all these shall the glorie of our nation
be enlarged continually, when men of true wisedome &
godlinesse, do both rule and obey euerie where. A state
most certaine to endure long. A Prince ten times happie,
and renowmed to be the head of a people so excelling
in all true wisedome and vnderstanding.
            Being thus vndoubtedly perswaded of so manie and
rich blessings to ensue,A part of our happinesse to shew our loue in furthering so great a good. vpon the right finding out, and
making knowne the best courses of teaching in the Grā
               mar
schoole, without the least euill that I can surmise, I
haue thought, that this shall be a speciall part of my comfort,
and a mercie aboue all other outward fauors, which
the Lord hath euer vouchsafed me, if I may but do the
least seruice herein, or but shew my desire to further so
great a good. Hereupon haue I bene encouraged (as I
said) not onely to trauell thus farre in it, but also to tender
this my poore seruice vnto all, presuming vpon the

kind acceptance of it amongst all sorts; which the Lord
hath hitherto vouchsafed, so far forth as I know. Because
my confidence hath bene, from my first entrance into
this trauel, according to the desire of my heart, that these
small beginnings might soone receiue such plentifull
augmentations, as in time to accomplish all the good
which hath bene mentioned; and as the Lord hauing verified
amongst verie manie, will I trust euerie day more
manifest vnto all.Why this work was the more hastned to the publike view. I also at the first edition of it, hastened
it the more, because, as we are borne for all, (as before
was said) and receiue all our talents for the benefite of euerie
one, to whom they may do good, and are thereby
each so deeply indebted vnto them, so I haue endeuored
since to increase my former experiments, and to make
them vndoubted, by full, and most certaine triall (as I
trust and heartily pray:) that all sorts for whom they haue
bene written,The vncertaintie of our liues ought to make vs to do all the good we can whiles we may. may reape some benefit by them, so long
as schooles or learning shall remaine. And what is my
life but a vapou
                  •
               , so that I might haue bene taken away
before the work
                  •
                had euer come to light, like as some of
my fellow labou
                  •
               ers in this kind haue bene, (of whom I
receiued some of these directions,M. To
                     •
                  ey. M. Coote. M. Richardson and those not of the
smallest moment) who had bene able to haue done farre
greater seruice in this kind;We cannot appeare before our 
                     •
                  od, if we haue not done our vttermost endeuour to pay our debts, and to employ our talents to bring most aduantage to our maister. most of whose worthie experiments
in this behalfe, were buried with them? Or
how could I haue euer stood before the Lord, if (being
so fully resolued & assured of the good that might come
by this labour, and for that likewise, by the bond of the
Communion of Saints, all to whom this benefite of it
might redound, had interest in it; the Lord also hauing
offered me so fit oportunitie,) I should not haue sought
the discharge of this my debt to the vttermost farthing?
Might I not iustly haue feared, that he would haue bene

displeased for my negligence and loitering in so necessarie
a worke? Why should I not then still communicate
from time to time, what he hath further vouchsafed me
in my continuall trauell? Yea why should I not stirre vp
all my louing brethren, to the full perfecting of that,
which hath bene by his goodnesse brought thus far forward
towards the same?
            Why should we suffer the industrie of the enemies to
be a condemnation to vs,Considering well the industrie of our enemie. for omitting our opportunities
of accomplishing any seruice, which may concerne
the glory of our God, the welfare of this people, and the
perpetuall benefit of this our deare nation: when they
watch all occasions not onely to hinder whatsoeuer
good they can amongst vs, but to put out for euer the
candle of Israell.Witnesse for euer the powder fornace. When as they will toyle day and night
with the perill of their liues, to vndermine, and blow
vp our royall King, and Prince, our Nobles, and worthies,
with all our glorie at once; thereby to make an easier
passage to their most bloudie and accursed massakers,
to murder all who beare anie loue to Christs Gospell,
yea to destroy vtterly all the people of the Lord, euen
through the whole world, if it were possible, as their
furious rage doth at this day proclaime, though with
the endlesse destruction of themselues both soules and
bodies, and euen of their natiue countrey their mother
which bred them.
            Notwithstanding,This worke hath not bene set vpō rashly, but vndertakē by an holy & warrantable calling. I haue not rashly attempted to enter
into this so great a worke, but, I hope, that I may truly
say, that the Lord our louing God, who hath holpen
me hitherto, hath called me vnto it. And this hath he
done, partly enforcing me by necessitie, to seeke out the
easiest, speediest, and best meanes to manage this my
calling, and wherby I might do most good in my place,

to be thereby in some sort answerable to the same. Partly
by giuing me a confident assurance, euen from the beginning
of this my trauell, what a benefite might come
to all sorts, by the read
                  •
               est courses once found out; and
more also in this, that I haue seemed to my selfe, by his
goodnesse, to haue from time to time gained euer somewhat
by my search: & haue withall obserued how much
some few schooles haue excelled others, chiefly through
the better courses which they haue followed. Partly by
vouchsafing me strength, and cheerfulnesse to proceed
thus farre, still adding vnto me some new experiments.
More specially by causing me to haue an earnest desire,
and an hope by this meanes to answer the loue of certaine
worthie friends, in seeking that good to theirs,
which I was not able to performe vnto themselues. But
aboue all, hath he called me hereunto, by the encouragement
which I haue receiued from some principall
benefactors to schooles,By special benefactors to schooles such who had author

            But to passe ouer this point. That worthie desire of
our royall Soueraigne (whom the Lord long preserue
to his glory and the good of all his people) namely to

haue all good learning to florish in these his dominions,
declared so many wayes, & specially in that his gracious
incitement to all Schoolemaisters (in the conclusion of
his Maiesties letters, set before our common Grammar
(ought not onely to prouoke, but to binde vs all, who
haue this function and charge, to indeuour our selues to
the vttermost, to search out still the best meanes for the
most fruitfull training vp of our Scholars, in all good
literature and vertuous conditions, where he so royally
assureth vs, that as we shall receiue reward of Almightie

And therefore whatsoe

               er comfort we shall finde
by our trauels therein, to make the same fully knowne
for the generall good of all, as God shall vouchsafe vs fit
occasions thereunto.
            For the manner which I haue vsed in all this proceeding;For the manner of proceeding in this worke, the Preface to our common Grammar doth direct it.
the Preface to the Reader in the same our common
Grammar hath directed me; where hauing affirmed
that the varietie of teaching is diuerse, and alwayes
will be, for that euerie Schoolemaister liketh that which
he knoweth, & seeth not the vse of that which he knoweth
not, and therefore iudgeth that to be the most sufficient
way, which he seeth to be the readiest meane to
bring a learner to haue knowledge therein; it directeth vs
thus: Wherefore it is not amisse (saith it) if one seeing by
triall an easier and a readier way then the common sort of
Teachers do, would say that he hath proued, and for the
commoditie allowed it, that others not knnwing the same,
might by experience proue the like, & then by proofe reasonably
iudge thereof: not hereby excluding the better way
when it is found, but in the meane season forbidding the
worse. This course haue I followed in all directions
which I haue here obserued, & set them downe accordingly.

Whereas it may be obiected and said,Though many haue written hereof, yet none haue proceeded in this particular manner for the helpe of he meanest. that sundry
haue written very learned treatises, concerning the
trayning vp of youth: I answer, that it is so indeede; yet
(that I may speake in modesty as the truth is) all the learned
do well know, that they are such, as do onely set
downe the same in a generall maner; or do write of some
one piece or two alone, or at most of some few parts of
Grammar learning and matters appertaining thereunto;
and the principall of them vnknowne to the common
sort of teachers: or else they are beyond the capacity and
reach of the meaner sort (for whom this is cheifly intended;)
or at least, they haue specially fitted their course,
for the instruction of two or three alone, to be trained
vp in priuate houses, as our renowned Maister A
                     •
                  kam.
But none whom I know, or haue heard of, haue in this
kind of search and triall, gone through the seuerall parts
of our Grammarschoole learning, applying themselues
for the weakest, & for the common countrey Schooles,
thus leading them as by the hand, thorow all the whole
courses thereof, onely according to our common Grammar
and most approued classicall Authors.
            Neither haue I in this,This worke hath not bene proceeded in by priuate conceit. followed mine owne priuate
conceit, but besides searching by reading, triall and obseruation,
I haue first for many yeares inquired further
(as I said) the best courses, from the most experienced,
who haue proued them: euen of such as haue sent most
excellent scholars vnto the Vniuersities; as I haue bene
assured from some of the chiefe in the same. Secondly I
haue made triall to see a demonstration of euery thing.
Thirdly I haue had (so much as I could) the iudgement
of all the learned, with whom I could confer or communicate.
Fourthly, so far as I haue bene able, I haue procu
               
                  •
               ed
yearely trials to be made by some of the best authoritie,

learning, and iudgement that I could obtaine this
fauour of, & haue intreated them to censure all things
frankely, and to direct vs wherein they found or thought
vs defectiue, to confirme and encourage vs wherein we
proceeded in a right course.
            Neither haue I conferred with any louing friend
hereof (so farre as I remember) who hath not approued
of the course, and wished all good successe to this my
trauell.Nor posted on, but hastened slowly. So that I haue not posted it forward, but hasted
slowly; and vsed so farre as God hath granted me opportuniy,
all meanes of due preparation, and of mature deliberation:
thus enquiring of (as I said) and conferring
with so many of the best experienced, as either my calling,
or greatnesse of the charges in trauell would permit.
And moreouer before I published any thing hereof
in print, I sent some draughts, vnto sundry learned, for
their helpe and direction, though not to the hundredth
man to whom I desired. For that I was neither able to
get copies enow written, nor to procure them written
truly, much lesse to be at the charge to send thē abroad
into all parts, to many, who I know would willingly haue
laid to their hands, and added their experiments. Therefore
herein also, in steed of sending any moe written copies
abroad, I after a time, by the coūsell of some faithfull
and iudicious welwillers to this worke, thought it best
to follow that worthy President of most happy labours,
Maister Perkins; who when he was in hand with his
Probleme, being aduised to send some copies first to his
learned freinds, answered that he could not get copies
enow written, & though he procured some writtē forth,
and by good scholars, yet they were so defectiue, as that
he could not well send thē. And for that cause he would
print some few of them first, which might go forth to

the view of the world, and so he might heare the common
censure of all, and receiue the helpe of his freinds,
and then reforme accordingly. Thus did I aduenture
to send forth the former draught of my Grāmar Schoole,
with some other parts belonging to the same to the publique
view of all, that I might the sooner heare and receiue
the free censures and better directions of all louing
freinds, and welwillers vnto this worke, so to be forthwith
trying, reforming and supplying, like as I haue
continued vntill this day.
            In the whole worke,The Author assumeth to himselfe onely the wants & errors. as I promised not any thing but
my trauell, which I haue striuen to performe with all
the poore ability which the Lord hath vouchsafed me,
so I take nothing to my selfe, but onely the wants and
errours. The rest is his who hath giuen this desire, and
prolonged my life, granted me vnderstanding, strength,
and opportunitie to bring it thus farre forward. What
directions or experiences herein, I haue receiued from
others, as yet, or lately liuing, I would haue set downe
with their names adioyned, like as I haue done of some
(which I know might haue brought much credit to the
worke, for the authority of sundry of them; and thereby
euerie one of them haue had their due) but that they did
not thinke it meete, desiring to be concealed. What I
haue gathered out of the writings of the chiefe learned
who haue reuiued learning in this last age, as Sturmius,
Melanchton, Erasmus, & others, either shortly set downe,
or plainly poynted at in them; I haue omitted likewise
to mētion particularly; not any way to wrong or detract
from them, but partly for that I did not note the places
at my reading of them; and moreouer for that I thought
that labour more troublesome then profitable to the
Reader.
            
               
Neither take I vpon me any way to prescribe to the
meanest,Prescribeth not to anie. knowing my self so far inferiour to the greatest
part, but do begin to thinke more and more, of this
weightie calling, as Paul did of the sacred Ministerie, and
to breake out into that his admiration, who is sufficient
for these things? who is meete to haue the treasure both
of Church and Common-wealth, with the hopes of all
posteritie committed vnto him, and much more to prescribe
perpetuall rules in this behalfe? Much lesse do I
pre
                  •
               ume to teach them of most excellent gifts; but as
a poore fellow labourer for the common good, and a
willing learner of all, I do humbly desire the iudgement
and helpe of all the chiefe learned, both for their cause
who wish this, and for the vniuersall benefit of the present
age, and of all posteritie. That I may see still both
what they approue in the courses set downe, also what
they disallow, and likewise vpon what grounds; what
may be bettered, what is yet wanting, and what is superfluous.
            Thus is my hearts desire, to trauel in it still, according
as I haue begun, vntill the Lord shall accomplish the
whole worke, which although it should be seuen yeares
more, yea many moe before; yet the Lord prolonging
my dayes, I shall euer increase in reioycing in my vndoubted
assurance of the rich blessing, which God will
giue vnto it, & thinke all my labour most happily spent.
But herein let not any man expect from me great matters,
in a lofty kind of verse or prose, or eminency in declamations,
orations, or the like, this I leaue to our worthy
renowned schooles of Westminster, Eaton, Winchester,
and the rest both in London & elsewhere, and to
our Schoolemaisters of chiefe fame, whose breeding &
imployment in schooles hath bin accordingly; and who

haue ancient scholars long exercised in these kinds. Cō
               cerning
whom I am so far off frō enuying any excellent
learning in them, that I wish all others partakers of the
like in their kind. And for my selfe I content me with
this mercie from the Lord, and blesse him for it, that I
haue trauelled chiefly for our meaner & ruder schooles;
and that he hath vouchsafed me this fauour, to bring my
worke so farre forward, as to helpe to direct hitherto,
according to the things mentioned in the Contents.
Yet this I humbly desire of all such of principall note,
for education, gifts and experience, to further vs with
their better directions in all these exercises and the rest;
& now God hauing so accomplished my desire for the
first foundation, and let me see his blessing vpon the little
ons, I will labour to follow them in what I am too
short, as fast as his goodnesse shall enable, vntill I shall
likewise find by experience, wherein that excellency and
comfort of theirs doth consist, and come as neare vnto
them as I can. Though therein, Cum in primis non liceat;
in secundis tertijsve consistere pulchrum erit.
            
            For the length of the worke in the Grammar schoole,Reasons for the length of the worke.
I haue in many things contracted very much in this edition.
And for those things wherein I may seeme ouer
tedious, as namely in the first entrance of children, in
teaching Accidence and Grammar, also for construing,
parsing, and making Latine, I would haue all consider
how therein I haue contended to direct the carefull
Maister, to incite both himselfe, and his little ones, as by
play, to make the least to loue the Schoole and learning;
and for that those things being well performed, all the
difficulty is past. Yea in all such places I would wish you
euer still to remember this, that I wrote not for the great
learned, but chiefly for the simplest, & yong beginners,

both teachers and learners, with whom I cannot be too
plaine; although I haue and do still striue to abridge
whatsoeuer can be, so as I may be well conceiued of
all, for whom I labour; and in the end of euery chapter
haue vsually repeated briefly the sum thereof. And
knowe withall, that I haue thought it my dutie to set
downe whatsoeuer I haue found to be profitable, that
out of them all, the best may bee setled, being confirmed
by the trials of many. In which respects some of
great learning, who perused the work formerly, haue not
seene how it could well be any shorter, nor what might
well be spared, especially being thus offered to the publique
censure. Consider moreouer what great volumes
haue bene written of some one of these points alone,
whereas my indeuour hath bene to go thorowe them
all, shewing in euery one, what I take to be principally
necessary or behooffull. And finally remember that
which Martiall wittily and truly affirmeth:

                  Non sunt longa quibus nihil est quod demere possis.Martial. Epig.
                  
               
               
                  Things are not long, wherin there is not ought to
spare.
               
            
            Those for whom it hath bene labored in, who wil not
vouchsafe it the reading because of the length, would
much lesse haue taken the paines, or haue bene at the
cost, to haue trauelled, searched, and tried to haue
found it out. Although this I dare constantly auow, and
keepe within my bounds, that it had counteruailed
vnto me both the labour of an hundredth times reading
it ouer, and as manie times the charges, if I had
knowne but the things from my first entrance into teaching,
which God hath now thus made knowne to all; besides
the freeing both of my body and minde from much
toyle and griefe. Notwithstanding that I then both read

all whom I could get in this argument of teaching, and
also had from the beginning for sundry years the aduice
and direction ofMaster Iohn Ireton of Kegworth, mentioned before. one in whose house I liued, who was
well knowne to be inferiour to few in all excellent learning,
and euen in this kinde amongst other. Neither do I
doubt, but that whosoeuer he be that would do good in
this function, especially of the new beginners, and shall
peruse the worke with desire to make his benefit of it,
shall meete with some one thing alone or other in it,
(which if he will practise it aright) he will freely acknowledge
to be worth all his labour, as I haue done
sundry of them at the receiuing and triall of them, and
much more shall he do the same for all the rest.
            Yet for those who would not reade ouer the whole
treatise at large,The vse of it to the learned, who would not reade the whole. they may see the sum briefly in the margents,
& so in the table in the end, to reade what they desire,
to passe ouer the rest. But for them for whom I haue
trauelled, I had much rather to be ouerlong, to the end
that I may omit nothing which concerneth their helpe,Better for the learners that the worke should be ouerlarge then too short.
& may be vnderstood of all, then by being ouer-short, to
omit many things, or not to be vnderstood of the greatest
part: as it falleth out in most Compendiums. For as I
once heard a great learned and holy man say publikely
in the Vniuersitie concerning Compendiums,
               D
                     •
                  . 
                     〈◊〉
                  . that they
brought ordinarily but a compendiarie knowledge; so it
will be found certainly true, amongst all learners of
them in matters of any difficulty, vnlesse they haue the
help of good readers, or of most familiar Commentaries
and expositions, to make them plain. Because cōmonly
the learners do imagine that they haue gotten that learning
by them which indeed they are ignorant of, and so
ceasse from searching further; although for those who
vnderstand them fully, or haue meanes to haue them

plainly opened, they are of most singular vse, for the
easie remembring and practise of the things contained
in them.
            Moreouer howsoeuer I should not be able to attaine
to each point aymed at here, and wished, nor to
any one of them in the absolute perfection,This trauell happily emploied, if but to effect these things following. yet I euer
thought from the beginning that my trauell should be
most happily employed, if I might effect but only these
things following, or some of them, as namely:
            If I might but set others on work,1. If but to set others on work hereby. to search yet further,
or to make trial of these experiments or better, for the ful
assurance of all sorts, to finde out at length, that which is
desired.
            Or secondly,2. Or to gain moe experiments, which men are so hardly drawn to communicate. if it were but to gaine the experiments
of some others who haue most happily trauelled herein.
And the rather, for that sundry of chiefe experience in
this kinde, are so hardly drawne to impart that which
they know; either for lacke of opportunities, or lest they
should be thought to presume ouer much, or suspecting
the censures of others, or for some like by respects, wherby
both Church and Common-wealth are depriued of
their due; to wit, of such singular helpes as might exceedingly
tend to the benefit of them both.
            Or thirdly,3. Or to make known sundrie most profitable bookes and helpes. if I might but make known amongst alsorts,
sundry most profitable bookes and helpes which God
hath to this end prouided, both for Maisters and Scholars,
which haue formerly bene hid, and are vtterly vnknowne
to the greatest part.
            Or fourthly,4. To helpe all desirous to doe good, and yet toyle without fruit. if I may but only help such of my brethren
as toile without fruit or comfort, wearying themselues in
an earnest study to do good, and do mourne and sigh,
wishing better directions. And much more those, who
neuer knew any good proceedings, and liue as burdens

to the publike hurt, for lacke of direction in this behalfe.
That so not any one, who maketh conscience of his calling,
and will inquire, should be vnprofitable.
            Yea fiftly,If but to gain one yeare. if I might but helpe the common sort,
how to gaine but one yeare only in the getting of learning,Thogh there may be hope of almost double sound learning, to that which hath bene in manie rude places.
& lessening of charges, chiefly for the poorer. Albeit
that my vndoubted hope is, that by these courses
alone almost double sound and good learning may be
gained, in regard of that which hath bene and is in many
country Schooles, for vnderstanding, speedinesse, certainty
and delight. That little children being rightly
trained vp, may do more at nine or ten yeares old, then
in many places at fourteene or fifteene, as Master Askam
saith, concerning the Northern parts in his time; when
they went to the schoole little children, and came away
great lubbers; alwaies learning, little profiting, learning
without booke euery thing, and vnderstanding within
booke little or nothing, as he rightly affirmeth. And for
the further euidence hereof, that so much more good
may bee done hereby, it is very apparent in this. That
a great deale may be gained by three or foure of these
helpes alone,For that so much may be gained by three or foure of these helps alone. which either are not knowne, or not practised
in the ordinary Schooles.
            As first, by winning a yeare or two in the beginning,
by 
                  •
               etting them to schoole so soone as they are able to
learne.
            Secondly, by causing all things in Schools to be done
with vnderstanding. Of the benefite whereof see Chap.
5. of the Grammar Schoole.
            Thirdly, by making the Scholars very perfect, first in
their grounds, viz Accidence, chiefly in Nounes and
Verbes, after the maner which is shewed there; and after
likewise in the Grammar it selfe, for the perfect vse, vnderstanding

and applying of the rules. This will gaine
much in time, and more in ease and certainty then can be
imagined.
            Fourthly, by making them very perfect in their authors,
as they proceed.
            Fiftly, by the knowledge and practise of the rule of
construing, and of translations formed according vnto
the same, for all the lower sort.
            Sixtly, by hauing in all things the most easie, sure, and
excellent patternes to follow; which, they being kept
vnto constantly, must needes come in time to expresse
very liuely, or at least come neere vnto them. To omit
the benefit of increasing in our owne toung as in the
Latin; and all things for going certainly without staggering
or doubting, and much more by their growing in
their writing, together with their other learning, & that
by one and the same labour.
            Now if by these few so much may be gained, and
much more by all the rest together, being constantly
practised: then let euery man iudge what we might certainly
expect, if many moe learned well-willers, would
adde still but each his seuerall experiment.
            These same, amongst others, haue bene the seuerall
ends, whereat I haue aimed, and thought my labours
should be happily emploied, if I might in any sort attaine
vnto them. Wherein how farre the Lord hath
vouchsafed to fulfill my desire, I refer it to euery one
who hath or shall duely make triall of that which I haue
written.
            That I do in this worke so much account of Grammaticall
translations,Reason of the high account of grā
                  matical translations. which I so oft mention in the
Grammar schoole, as namely Chap. 8. where I shew the
manner, vse and benefit of them, I hope that this wil be

found true by experience, that after children haue bene
well trained vp in their Accidence, and a litle entred and
acquainted with them, following the courses directed for
thē, they will go ouer their whole Authors so translated,
by the help of thē, before they could haue gone through
one third part of them without. And also that they will
learne their authors far more perfectly for each good vse,
and keepe them much more surely, with lesse labour or
trouble; besides that they shall continually learne by
them to make Latine truly and purely, and to get matter
and phrase, aswell as to construe and parse. And furthermore
because in all the formes which shall vse them,
chiefly in the higher, they wil be found for the most part
to be in stead of the Maisters or Vshers labour, and euer
certaine, teaching English as wel as Latine, without any
of the inconueniences vsually imagined; so that there be
a wise direction and ouersight, as in all other things, that
they be vsed aright.
            Besides experience, the reasons are most euident, as
I haue shewed in their place;Chap. 8. especially by making all
their authors to be so easily and soone vnderstood,
and then for the continuall practise by them of the
Grammar Analysis and Genesis: and finally that by them
may be such a daily vse of translating both into English
& Latin: all which are so highly commended by the learned,
for the speedy getting of any tongue. And hereunto
the two first leaues of Master Askams Schoolmaster
whom I principally esteeme and propound,Master Askams testimonie of the practise of translating. do giue
sufficient testimony. Hee in the very entrance of his
booke, sharply reproouing the common order of making
Latins practised in Schooles; and hauing shewed
how by that (as it is comonly said) children are vtterly
marred, and also hauing giuen most manifest reasons of

the hurt which comes thereof, for the feare that children
are driuen into: affirming moreouer, that nothing hath
more dulled the wits, or taken away the wils of children
from learning, then that: and lastly how they learne
euill choise of words, wrong placing, and ill framing of
sentences, and that which they must vnlearne againe;
he afterwards speakes thus, concerning this kinde of
translating, and the benifits of it.
            There is a way (saith he) touched in the first booke
of Cicero de Oratore,
               This is well worthie the marking of all. which wisely brought into
Schooles, truly taught, and constantly vsed, would not
onely take away that butcherly feare of making Latines,
but also with ease and pleasure, and in short time, as I
know by good experience, worke a true choise, and
placing of words, a right ordering of sentences, an easie
vnderstanding of the tongue, or readinesse to speake,
facilitie to write, a true iudgment both of his owne and
other mens doings; what toung soeuer he doth vse.
Then he setteth downe the manner, how the child
should be taught to translate a peece of Tully, or a like
Author thus plainly, & afterwards out of his translation
to turne it into the Latin of the Author againe; and then
by comparing with the Author to see how neere he
came, and where he missed; so to amend it, still striuing
vntill he come to expresse his Author truly. By this he
saith, the maister may teach all those things which are
most tedious and difficult without any errour, and the
scholar may learne without any great paine, the Maister
being led by so sure a guide, & the scholar brought into
so plaine and easie a way. This is the summe of Maister
Askams speech.
            Now these Grammaticall translations of our lowest
Schoole Authors, do performe the same things for

all young scholars farre more surely and speedily.
            More surely, because the scholar translating into English
of himselfe, vnlesse the Maister vse maruellous diligence,
before in making him very perfect in the true construing
of it, and as much after in perusing & amending
euery thing which is faulty, the child wil misse in translating;
and if he translate falsly into English, or misse of the
Grammaticall order, he can not translate into the same
Latine againe, vpon sure grounds and reason, vnlesse
he go by rote, as we say. Moreouer that labour for so
perusing the translations, of euery one of each forme
thorough a Schoole, would be endlesse in the greater
schooles, and much more when they haue turned it into
Latine, for comparing all with the Author, and reducing
each thing into the right order; whereas these being so
translated vnto their hands, do first guide them certainly
how to construe or to translate, to reade all things which
they learne by them, into a true translation, and consequently
to turne them perfectly into the Latine of the
Authour againe.
            These do it also more speedily,More speedily. in as much as they may
reade ouer many lines turning them into English or Latine
before that they can write one. Although that kind
of translating by pen of themselues, both into English
and Latine, hath also her due place and singular vse,
for some speciall benefits thereof, as writing true Orthographie,
and the like, as I shall shew in the handling
of it.
            Furthermore,This verie course in effect practised by Maister Askam.
                this very course of translating peeces of
Tully or the like good Author, into plaine naturall English,
by the Maister himselfe, and giuing them to the
Scholar to turne into Latine, to trie how neere he can
come to the Author, and then comparing it with the

Author, he sets downe in the beginning of his second
booke, page 2.
            By this meanes he saw that experience which might
seeme almost incredible,Experience of the singular benefit of it in Maister Iohn Whitne
                     •
                  . in that hopefull young Gentleman
(whose death he so much bewaileth) Maister Iohn
VVhitney, in Sir Anthony Dennies house, where the
Ladie Elizabeth did lye, when he came to serue her; that
within lesse then the space of a yeare, he had so profited
in writing pure Latine, that (as he saith) some in seuen
yeares in the Grammar Schooles, yea some in the Vniuersities,
could not do halfe so well. So afterwards he
saw the like in his happiest Schollar that euer England
had bred, our late Queene, who made vs all happie;
who, as hee saith, did so farre surpasse all of her yeares
in excellencie of Learning,This way of translating the chiefe & sure meanes to attaine speedily to any tongue. Maister Askams Schoolemaster. Lib. 2. p. 33. and knowledge of diuers
Tongues, that verie fewe of the rarest wits in the Vniuersities
could any way reach vnto her. And this seemeth
euidently to haue bene the chiefe meanes; like
as he prooueth at large, by the authoritie of many great
learned, this way of translating, to be either the onely,
or at least the chiefe, readie, and sure meanes to attaine
speedily to any tongue.
            And that I may adde but one other testimonie of a
rare and knowne experience in this kind.A late known and worthie experience in a young Noble-man of rare hope. At the Commencement
of that right noble, and memorable Gentleman,
Sir Iohn Harington, (who now rests and reignes
with the Lord) hauing speech with Maister Touey, who
had bene a Schoolmaister, equall (as he was indged) to
most of the chiefe in that kind; but was then wholly employed
for the attendance and tuition of that young
Noble-man (with whom he also liues now in heauen,)
I desired to know this of him: that whereas I had writ
vnto him formerly, to haue taken some paines, in setting

downe the shortest and best way of teaching, according
to his experience; and now there was a rare fame, that
God had giuen an extraordinarie blessing to his endeuours
with that young Noble-man, so that he did of a
sodaine go farre beyond most others of his time, (aboue
all former expectation:) that he would vouchsafe to
impart vnto me, in a word or two, what were the principall
meanes he had vsed thereto. He acknowledging
thankfully, that he had indeed seene much experience
of Gods mercie therein, told mee, that this was
the principall and summe of his course: That he had
bene enforced to begin againe, euen from the verie Accidence,
causing him to get the perfect vnderstanding
of the Rules, for the meaning and vse, though he could
not the words in so short a time; and after that, he had
caused him to practise continual translating into Latine,
after this manner. That he himselfe had chosen easie
places of Tully, and other familiar Authors, which the
Gentleman knew not, and caused him to turne them into
Latine, and after brought him to the Author, to compare
that which he had written, to the same, iust according
to this last manner mentioned out of Maister Askam.
After, rounding me in the eare, he said; But shall
I tell you, It was by Prayer, quoth he. Hereupon, after
my returne, I set my selfe to put all these in practise, yet
more seriously then formerly I had done. But for this
kinde of translating, finding the toyle and impossibilitie
of it, first to translate peeces fit for euerie Forme, and
after to examine euerie ones exercise, how he had translated,
and to correct them; I wholly bent my selfe to
trie how this might be done, thorow the seuerall lower
Formes, that they might haue most practise of it.
            Thus trying sundrie waies, which were ouer-long to

recite, and amongst others, hauing seene in a chiefe
Schoole in London, good vse of verball translations; amongst
some other things, I began to thinke, that by
the meanes of translations of the first Authors which
Scholars learne, this translating might be practised in
each lower Forme continually. But there were yet two
maine difficulties, which had formerly hindred me from
any such vse of them. First, that our vsuall translations
did direct the young Scholars vncertainly, and sometimes
amisse, being oft rather to expresse the sense, then
the words in anie right order of Grammar; and that
the learners must go by memorie, and as it were by rote,
more then by anie certaintie of Rule, vnlesse they were
of better iudgement. And secondly, that for this and
other inconueniences, translations were generally in
disgrace in Schooles. Therefore, this then I thought
necessarie to be my first labour, to finde out some certaine
rule to follow, according to which to frame these
translations, and which might be the guide of all.
            And herein I,To whom the finding out of the rule, and of translations thereby is acknowledged. vnder Iesus Christ, acknowledge my
selfe be holden for the rule of construing and translating,
in the beginning of my Schoole labours, now aboue
30. yeares ago, first to Maister Crusius: since to the reuerend
and ancient Schoole-maister, Maister Leech. Thirdly,
after them to that painefull, Maister Coote, of Hunsden
in Essex, now with the Lord. And fourthly, to that learned
Go
                     •
                  leuius, and to some other of my acquaintance,
who had likewise taken paines in this rule, which they
willingly imparted vnto me.
            And so from that time vntil this day,Labour to find out the rule▪ and to frame the translations accordingly. I haue still bene
labouring to find out the rule more exactly, & to frame
the translations according to the same. Secondly, this
hath bene my next studie, to seeke out the right vses and

benefits of these translations,And also the right vses & benefits of them. and so in all things to set
them downe, as they might be a certaine direction, wherby
most easily and surely to reape the fruite of them.
Lastly I haue trauelled herein specially to haue full triall
& assurance in euerie thing,And finally, to haue 
                     •
                  ull assurance of euery thing. that as I had gathered these
amongst other experiments, for the vse of all schooles, so
vpon certaine proofe by my selfe, and other of better
iudgement, I might at length commend them to all learners,
and so helpe to bring in that excellent vse of them
(which Maister Askam aduised) euen into the Schooles,
in which they had bene so formerly distasted, as that it
was thought a Paradox, but to name the vse of translations
i
                  •
                them.
            Now vpon this rule,Vpon what things all the chiefe benefits of these translations depend. and the expressing euerie thing
in the translations, both in proprietie, and also according
to the sence and meaning of the author, with varietie of
other English phrases, and supplying what is wanting,
to make vp the construction, with the other things obserued
therein, especially vpon the rule, depend all the
chiefe benefits, for a certaine Analysis and Genesis; both
for construing, parsing, making and tying Latin surely,
and sundrie of the rest,Chap. 8. as is shewed at large in the eight
Chapter of the Grammar Schoole.
            By the right practise of these translations, so framed,
as I am fully assured,Certaine benefits of these translations rightly vsed. by long experience, through the
Lords mercie and goodnesse, an increase will be found
in learning, farre more then can be well conceiued, before
due triall made, and that with much lesse trouble to
the Maister then otherwise: and with farre more delight,
certaintie, ease, and cheerfull emulation to the scholar.
I haue therefore thought it my dutie, after my vnfallible
experience of them, rightly vsed, so as I haue plainely
set downe the maner in this second edition of my Grammar

Schoole, and after my so long and painfull trauell,
to find out the Rule most certainly, with the best, and
most profitable vses thereof, to commend them more
confidently vnto all our Schooles, and to all desirous to
recouer speedily the knowledge of their Latin tongue,
or to increase therein. In a certaine affiance, that all who
shall vse them aright, shall see a rich blessing, without inconuenience:
yet lest in anie thing I should be thought
too peremptorie, I intreate the learned first to make
proofe, then to iudge hereof according as they find.
            For anie further apologie therefore for my bold attempt,Further Apologie needlesse, except, 1. The Authors desire to do all this good.
in these endeuours, I trust that some few of the
reasons lightly touched before, may be defence sufficient.
And first my vnfained studie to do all this good to
all sorts, without the least iniurie to anie one, so farre
forth as I shall know it, or without inuerting anie approued
course. And that howsoeuer I haue bene the vnfittest
of manie of my brethren, to enter vpon so hard a
taske, yet the weaker, the more meete haue I bene, to
haue a compassionate feeling of the wants of others; and
more like to applie my selfe to the capacitie of the meanest
and most ignorant: whereas the great learned and
acute do oft times thinke, that what they themselues vnderstand,
all others should presently conceiue, though
the most of the simple comprehend litle or nothing of it
fully, as they should.
            Secondly,2. The hauing all these experiments gathered to our hands. for that in these my poore labours, euerie
one may haue the wearie trauels, and comfortable experiments,
of manie learned thus gathered into one, and
brought therby vnto his hands without labor or charge,
which otherwise might haue cost them manie miles trauelling,
and some yeares triall, as well as my selfe, and
yet they might haue failed of manie things, which here

they may find, and more hereafter, as God shall vouchsafe
moe supplies vnto it.
            Thirdly,3. Assurance of each mans affection, to haue his child so brought vp as is here desired. because there is no man, hauing the nature
of a wise father, who would not haue his child to haue
some learning, howsoeuer he purpose to employ him
afterward, and who to that end would not haue him so
instructed, as whereby to get the best learning, in the
shortest time, and with the least seueritie, or who will
not giue almost double, if he may be assured to haue his
child so trained vp.
            Fourthly,4. For the testimonie of his cō
                  
                     •
                  cience to be vpright & faithfull 
                     〈◊〉
                   all his worke. for that I haue him who searcheth & trieth
the hearts, and whose good hand hath bene with me in
goodnesse, in all this worke, to beare witnesse vnto my
conscience, that I haue not either in this, or anie other
my trauels, aimed at vaine praise or commendation (for
that our holy God would turne into shame) or at anie
other sinister end; but that I haue striuen with all my
heart, so farre as in my weaknesse I haue bene able, to
aime at those verie ends alone, which our blessed Sauiour
hath taught me, in that diuine patterne of heauenly
prayer, which hath bene in all my labours my principall
direction. And namely, to manifest my dutie & thankfulnesse
to my heauenly father, like as for all other his
mercies chiefly in heauenly things in Christ, and for innumerable
temporall fauors, in his fatherly prouidence,
protection and direction vouchsafed vnto me;1. Anno 1588 so more
especially for those three great deliuerances (to be had
in euerlasting remembrance) not onely of our Church
and nation,2. The death of Queene Elizabeth, and peaceable bringing in our Soueraigne. & of all other the Churches of Christ with
them, but euen of my selfe particularly in euerie one of
them. And this I haue desired to do, by seeking first to
honour him,3. Powder 
                     •
                  reason. and secondly to aduance and enlarge his
kingdome, and to these ends searching to know and accomplish

all his holy will, tending thereunto, and so all
the other subordinate ends, as he hath directed me. Thus
haue I endeuoured to rely vpon that his gracious promise,
that thus seeking first the kingdome of God, and
his righteousnesse, all these other things should be added
vnto me, (as an ouer-measure) so farre as should be
good. And herein indeed I haue felt no breach of promise
from his Maiestie, but found him faithfully and
true; yea, exceeding bountifull, aboue all that I could
conceiue, in all things wherein his goodnesse hath enabled
me so to seeke him. Vpon all these grounds I can
nothing doubt, but through the mercie of the Lord, this
labour being intended to these verie ends, and prooued
to be answerable thereunto, without inconueniences in
the right vse of it, as my assured confidence is; I cannot
but fully hope, that it will in due time be most welcome,
and acceptable to all, that euer shal make triall by themselues
or others.
            Lastly,5. For willing sub
                     •
                  ission of al
                     •
                   things to the publike cen
                     •
                  ure. for that I willingly submit it, with all my labours,
to the louing censure of all the learned, who truly
loue Christs Gospell, being readie to be taught of the
meanest, who shall in anie thing shew me my error, or
giue me clearer light. And though the defects should
still be verie many (as in so difficult a worke it is no great
maruell;) yet sith I am most desirous to be continually
reforming, euerie ingenuous well-willer vnto good learning,
will (I trust) louingly pardon them, and thankfully
accept of that which God of his goodnesse hath granted.
Thus I put forth each first Copie of translations
or others,And desire to be still learning of all. as not set forth, but to go more generally to
all my louing friends, and well-vvishers to this worke, to
craue of them further helpe, as I sayd before.
            To this end, I do still humbly request, euerie true fauourer

of good learning, to lay to his hand, that so I
may be continually learning, amending, and perfecting,
so long as the Lord shall lengthen my daies.
            If in anie thing,The cause of the confi
                     •
                  nt reioycing in it. I haue or shall seeme to reioice ouermuch,
yet consider first, that in my generall work, in my
Grammar-Schoole, I haue thought the forme of a Dialogue
most fit; wherein more libertie is granted to incite
and incourage others. Secondly, that I haue not, nor
will speake anie more, then either what I haue seene experience
of, or whereof vpon good grounds, I am fully
assured, and which I take my selfe bound to relate, onely
to the praise of our God, & the good of others, to make
all others partakers of the comforts, which to that end
he hath vouchsafed vnto me, following so neare as I can,
that direction mentioned before, in the Preface before
our common Grammar. Thirdly remember that report
of Maister Askam, cōcerning Maister Iohn Whitney, farre
greater then all mine are together: and then I doubt not
(these things being rightly weighed) but all who are
wise hearted, will easily beare with me, in my confident
reioycing, trusting moreouer that God will verifie all
things, to euerie one who shall duly make triall. And in
this affiance, and testimonie of my conscience, before
his sacred Maiestie, I wholly relie my selfe.
            Therefore,Exhortation & encouragement to the weaker teachers. before I conclude, giue me leaue a little
to turne my speech to you, (my deare fellow labourers,)
and namely to all you of the weaker sort, for
whom I haue and do still chiefly trauell, whose hearts
are set as mine to do all the good you can, in your seuerall
places, all your dayes. To you all I wish, that as
we haue bene sometimes companions, in fruitlesse toile,
and vexation; so we may be now in reioycing at, and
admiring the new fruites of our labours. What a griefe

may this iustly be vnto vs,Griefe to all honest hearted maisters, for complaints and murmurings against thē. when one shall come, and crie
out of vs, to our faces: My sonne hath bene vnder you
six or seuen yeares, and yet is not able so much as to
reade English well; much lesse to construe or vnderstand
a peece of Latin, or to write true Latin, or to speake
in Latin in any tolerable sort,Complaints of parents for the
                     ••
                   children not profiting. which he might haue
bene well able to haue performed, if that you had taken
that course and those good paines with him which you
might haue done; for in such a schoole others much
yonger then mine are able to do it. Another shall complaine;
My sonne comes on neuer a whit in his writing.
Besides that his hand is such,Murmurings of Townes for charges ill bestowed and children spoiled. that it can hardly be read;
he also writes so false English, that he is neither fit for
trade, nor any employment wherein to vse his pen.
When all in a towne generally, shall murmure against
vs, in this or the like manner, that their children
do no good vnder vs, but lose their time, and spend
their friends mony, being brought vp idlely, made fit
for nothing, and therefore what should a schoole do amongst
them? That it were much better to turne the
maintenance giuen to the schoole, to beare the charges
of the towne for other duties and seruices, then so vnprofitably
to employ it.
            Moreouer how must this needs trouble vs,Some to crie out against our seueritie. when manie
shall crie out of our seueritie: some shall wish, I
would my child had neuer knowne him. If he had not
dealt so cruelly with my child, he had bene a scholar,
wheras now he is vndone. Or when our scholars coming
to mans estate, shall curse vs, for that by our blowes
they were made dunses or deafe (though this oftentimes
vniustly) or to hate all learning.Scholars comming to mans estate to bewaile losse of their time. Or shall generally bewaile
the losse of their time vnder vs, complaining as the
vsuall maner is, My Maister neuer taught me anie vnderstanding,

or right vse of good learning, that though I
was with sundrie, yet I was neuer the better. I got more
sence, and saw more light for the vse and excellency
of learning, and also felt more sweetnesse therein, in one
halfe yeare in the end, with one who directed me in a
better order, then in all my time, with all others. The
rest deceiued my parents, and were my vndoing. Or
when they shall thus complaine: Our Maister had not
anie care of our gouernment and manners.That they were not taught any religiou. He neuer
taught vs the feare of the Lord, nor made the least conscience
to plant anie Religion or grace in vs.
            Finally,Terrour for for lacke of growth of Gods religion. what a terrour shall this be vnto vs, and
what a wounding to our consciences, when we shall but
thinke, how the Lord and all good men, may most iustly
lay this vnto our charge, that the cause hath bene
chiefely in vs, that Gods religion, hath not thriuen any
better in our Land, in so long a time; but that Popery,
ignorance, Atheisme, and all irreligiousnesse, haue
farre more growne vp in many places? If we had bene
as carefull to season our youth, in the truth of Christ,
and to settle them in the grounds of his holy religion,
truly professed amongst vs, to their saluation, as the Popish
schoolemaisters are to corrupt them with Idolatry,
and superstition, vnto perdition, the knowledge and
loue of Gods true worship, and pietie, had flourished
amongst vs, euery where long ago, all Popery and Atheisme
rooted out. And what answer can we thinke to
make to God, for his religion, and people, for so many
who haue bene lost, chiefly through our lacke of care?
How should these things touch euery one of vs, euen
to the very hearts, and cause vs to bethinke our selues
at length, of this our weighty function, to the end to
take away all this reproch, and to begin to recouer the

credit of our worthy profession.
            You know well,The charge committed to vs. that we are they to whose charge
that rich treasure, both of Church and Cōmon wealth
is committed in trust, (as was said) and the hope of a
more happy age hereafter yet to come. We are they
who helpe either to make or marre all; for that all the
flower of our Nation, and those who become the leaders
of all the rest, are committed to our education, and
instruction: that if we bring them vp aright, there is great
hope, that they shall prooue goodly lights, and marks
to all the rest of the Land, especially, to the townes and
countries where they are; and cleane contrarily, most
wofull ensamples (as are euery where to be seene) if
they be spoiled through vs, or for lacke of our better
care. So that we must needs do the greatest good or
the greatest euill. As we are before them, so we may expect,
that they shall prooue for the most part after vs.
We are therefore the men, vpon whom the flourishing
of this our Canaan, doth very much depend. We cannot
then but know, that as our worke aud charge are
so weighty, and in course of education next vnto the
worke and charge of the holy Ministery, which we
also are to helpe to furnish: so our account must be according
to that which our God hath trusted vs withall,
and our reward answerable; dreadfull, if we haue bene
negligent; glorious, if we haue bene faithfull.
            We cannot be ignorant, how our enemies the Iesuits,
not onely in their Semina
                  •
               ies, but also in their lesser
schooles, do bend their wits, to go beyond vs in this verie
kind. Giue me leaue to put you in mind of that which
was written vnto me, from an ancient acquaintance in
the Vniuersitie, now sundrie yeares ago, and which I do
gladly acknowledge, to the praise of God, that it hath

from the first relation put more life vnto me in this businesse.
The summe of it was this.
            The Iesuites,The combinations of the Iesuites ought to prouoke vs. October, 28. 1608. the Popish schoolemaisters beyond the seas,
do combine themselues together, and all, or at least manie
schooles do reade the same bookes at one time, and the same
places, and do change euery quarter, and set vpon the schoole
dores, the Authors, place, lectures, exercises, euerie quarter,
newly printed, and for this they haue great suite made vnto
them by the Printers. This haue I lately learned of certaine
whom I vsed beyond the seas to this end. Thus farre my louing
friend. Whether this report was true in each particular,
I cannot certainly affirme, yet for the generall, we
all who vnderstand anie thing, do know that it is most
certaine.
            
            Now who are these who thus combine? are they not
the principall plotters of the ruine of all the Churches of
Christ, and of Common-wealths, as they are cried out
of, euen in the Popish countries themselues; the arch enemies
of Christ and his Gospell, and the chiefe vpholders
of the throne of the Beast, to make him king of
kings, and Lord of Lords. And what is their purpose in
seeking out the most excellent courses of getting most
speedily all good learning as they would pretend? Surely
their purpose is nothing else, as all the world may
plainely see, but by that their learning to ou
                  •
               -countenance
the heauēly learning, the sacred truth of that euerlasting
Gospell, and all the learned, who professe Christ
Iesus throughout the earth: to gaine all the flowre of the
Nobility, and Gentrie, yea of all the youth in all places
where they come, to bewitch all with an opinion of
their learning, the more easily when their time serues to

Christs Gospell, and to possesse their places. Yea if it

were in their power, or possible, to destroy all the
Churches of Christ, to extinguish vtterly all true learning,
to bring in againe all their old learning, as (they
call it) their palpable delusions, and abhominable Idolatry.What our state was almost by them.
We all saw, how nea
                  •
               e we were to be consumed
by their fornace. We with our royall King, our
Prince, our Nobles, and Rulers, the Church of Christ,
with the glory thereof. Now our God hauing so miraculously
plucked vs out, and we all being in a speciall
manner (next vnto our Gracious Soueraigne, and his
royall Progeny, together with these our Nobles and
Rulers, the holy ministery and noted professors) designed
in their hearts, as flesh for their caldron; let vs shew
our selues thankfull, euery one in our places and callings:
and in token of our thankfulnesse,Our miraculous preseruations, and their deadly malice, ought to put new life into euery one of vs. to our most mercifull
and blessed God (whose name is for this aboue all
other outward deliuerances, to be extolled for euermore;)
first for our liues, and then for our Religion the
life of our liues; let vs all be prouoked to bend our studies,
and euen to spend and end our liues, for our Christ,
and for our dread Soueraigne, vnder him. By whose
hand 
                  •
               e so (euen miraculously) deliuered vs, the second
time, like as formerly he had in a most wonderfull
manner, at his first comming to the Regall Crowne,
and his entring in amongst vs; whereby all their long
hopes, and bloudie designes against vs were dashed in
a moment, and that heauenly light continued to vs, and
to our posteritie (I trust till Christ shall come) which
they certainly accounted at both those times, to haue
put out for euer.
            Let vs now contrariwise stirre vp our selues, more
then euer heretofore, that the light of all good knowledge
may breake forth, and be as the morning brightnesse

before the Sunne rising, to prepare the way to that
glorious appearing, and kingdome, when we with all
the children of the light shall shine eternally in the heauens:
and when all those who haue sought deuices to
bring in againe darknesse vpon all, or but to hinder the
glorious light of truth, shall without their vnfained repentance
liue perpetually in their place of vtter darknesse.We haue no cause to fea

Oh that these enemies could thinke of this, and
be warned in time, to turne their thoughts another way,
euen for the King of Kings, that they might haue boldnesse
at his appearing. But to leaue them, praying for
them, that so many of them as belong to Gods eternall
election, may haue their eyes open to see their miserie,
and be conuerted and saued; and to returne to our
selues. There is no cause at all for vs, why we should
feare or doubt of a glorious triumph and crowne hereby;
if that we will but cheerfully ioyne hearts and hands;
prouoked by the combinations of these our bloud-thirtie
aduersaries, and all sticke close vnto our Lord and
Sauiour, our Captaine and teacher. With them is but

            But let none of vs be discouraged though we do not
find our desires at the first;None to be discouraged, if he see not his desire at the first. set to it cheerfully, and in due
time our eyes shall behold it.
            Thus also our brethren, who are of the most excellent
gifts, I meane the Maisters of all the principall
schooles of our nation, and all other sound hearted
fauourers of good learning, seeing our louing contention,
shalbe enforced to ioyne hearts, and hands,
and to affoord vs likewise their vttermost helpe and

Christ, and by our appearing before him, as they tender
his glory, the good of our Church & their natiue countrey,
I againe humbly intreat at their hands: especially
their directions for the best performance of these chiefest
and most necessarie excercises mentioned, and whatsoeuer
else they find vs too short in, for the full adorning
of the Grammar Schoole. By this means, shall the
worke of God prosper in our hands, going forward

glory of our most holy and onely wise God, the lasting

honour of our Nation, & of the Church of Christ, the
safe preseruation of our liues and religion, with the happinesse
of posteritie, euen to match & go beyond our aduersaries.
Thus finally all true learning shall be had in
lasting honour, and all vnfained fauourers and furtherers
of the same, shall triumph eternally. Which that it
may, let me onely adjoyne that worthy incouragement,
wherewith Christophorus Hegendorphinus incited
one of his scholars, now many yeares ago.Christoph. Hegendorphinus L. E. discipulo suo,

literae quam literati contemptui sint; redibit, crede mihi,
redibit suus honor, & literis & literatis: nam omnium rerum

selfe cheerfully vnto Greeke and Latin studies, as you
are wont. Neither let this terrifie you, that in this age,
as well learning as learned men are in such contempt.
There will returne (beleeue me) there will returne, their
due honour, both to learning and to learned men: for
there is an intercourse of all things. For vnto them that
shall liue in the last age, pleasant things shall be made
bitter, and yet pleasant and beloued afterwards againe,
as saith Sophocles that ancient Greeke Poet.
            Thus farre Hegendorphinus, as foretelling (truly I trust)
the glorie of this last succeeding age, whereto let all
heartie friends of good learning euer say, Amen.

Rules, to

                   their Grammar rules; to giue the meaning,
vse, and order of the rules, to shew the examples, and to apply
them: which being well performed, will make all other
learning easie and pleasant.
               4. In the seuerall 
                     〈…〉
                   and Authors to construe truly,

                  s and sense, and also in pure phrase;
to parse of themselues, and to giue a right reason of euerie
word, why it must be so and not otherwise; and to deliuer
the English of the Lectures perfectly out of the Latine.
               5. Out of an English Grammaticall translation of their
Authors, to make and to construe anie part of the Latine
which they haue learned, or do presently learne; to proue
that it must be so, and so to reade the Latine out of the English,
first in the plaine Grammaticall order; after as the
wo
                     •
                  ds are placed in the Author, or in other good composition.
Also to p

                  rse in Latine, looking onely vpon the translation;
and to all their Poets which they so learne: to do all this without
booke, which is farre the surest, viz. to repeate, construe,
and parse with their booke vnder their arme.
               
                  
6. To take their Lectures of themselues, except in the
verie lowest Formes, and first entrers into construction; or
to do it with verie little helpe, in some more difficult things.
               7. To enter surely in making Latine, without danger of
making false Latine, or vsing anie barbarous phrase.
               8. To 
                     〈◊〉
                   true Latine, and pure Tullies phrase, and to

                  , imitating Tully and the best A

in that kind, 
                     〈◊〉
                   and pithie, in pure Latine, and familiar.
               10. To translate into English, according to proprietie
both of words and sense▪ and out of the English to reade
the Latine againe, to proue it, and giue a reason of euerie
thing.
               11. To take a peece of Tully, or of anie other familiar easie
Authour, Grammatically translated, and in proprietie of
words, and to turne or reade the same, out of the Translation
into good Latine, and verie neere vnto the words of the
Author; so as in most, you shall hardly discerne, whether it
be the Authors Latine or the Scholars.
               12. To correct their faults of themsel
                     •
                  es, when they are
but noted out vnto them, or a question is asked of them.
               13. To be able in each Forme (at anie time whensoeuer
they shall be apposed of a sodaine, in any part of their Authors,
which they haue lately learned) to construe, parse,
reade into English, and in those Authors, whereof they
haue translations; forth of the translation, to construe and
to reade into the Latine of their Author. First into the naturall
order, then into the order of the Author, or neare vnto
it, and in their Poëts to do all this without booke, as was
sayd before, and so to giue an account, at each quarters 
                     •
                  nd,
what they haue learned in that quarter; so from quarter to
quarter to do the like.
               
                  
14. In Virgil, Horace, and other the chiefe and most
approued Schoole Authors in Poëtrie and Prose, to resolue
any peece, for all these points of learning, and to do it in
good Latine:

                     In
                     Construing, to giue propriety of words and sense, and
also to expound in good phrase.
                     Scanning the Verses, and giuing a reason thereof.
                     Shewing the difficulties of Grammar.
                     Obseruing the Elegances of Rhetoricke in Tropes
and Figures.
                     Noting Phrases and Epithets, with other principall
obseruations.
                  
               
               15. So to reade ouer so much of the chiefe Latine Poëts,
as Virgil, Horace, &c. and of other the best Authors, as
shall be thought necessary, by that time, that by reason of
their yeares they be in any measure thought fit, for their discretion,
to go vnto the Vniuersity; and to be able to go thorough
the rest of themselues, by ordinary helpes.
               16. In Greeke to take their Lectures of themselues, to
construe perfectly, and parse as in the Latine; to reade the
Greeke backe againe, out of a translation, Latine, or English;
also to construe, parse, and to prooue it out of the same.
               17. In the Hebrew to be able to construe perfectly, and to
resolue so farre as is necessary for the Grammar-schoole; and
to reade the Hebrew also out of the translation; which practise
of daily reading somewhat out of the translations into
the Originals, must needs make them, both very cunning in
the Tongues, and also perfect in the Texts of the Originals
themselues, if it be obserued constantly; like as it is in the
daily reading Latine out of the translation.
               18. To answer most of the difficulties in all classicall
Schoole-Authors; as in Terence, Virgil, Horace, Persius,
Iuvenal.
               
               
                  
19. To oppose scholar-like in Latine of any Grammar question
necessary, in a good forme of words; both what may be
objected against Lillies rules, and how to defend them.
               20. To write Theames full of good matter, in pure Latin
and with iudgement, and how to inuent matter of themselues.
               21. To enter to make a verse with delight, without any
bodging at all; and to furnish with copie of Poëticall phrase,
out of the best Poëts.
               22. So to imitate and expresse Ouid or Virgil, as you
shall hardly discerne, vnlesse you know the places, whether
the verses be the Authors or the Scholars: and to write
verses ex tempore of any ordinarie theame.
               23. To translate forth of English or Latin into Greeke.
Also to write theames or verses in Greeke.
               24. To pronounce naturally and sweetly, without vaine
affectation; and to begin to do it from the lowest fourmes.
               25. To make right vse of the matter of their Authors,
besides the Latin, euen from the first beginners: as of Sententiae,
and Confabulatiunculae Pueriles, Cato, Aesops
fables, Tullies 
                        •
                     pistles, Ouids Metamorphosis, and so on
to the highest. To helpe to furnish them with varietie of the
best morall matter, and with vnderstanding, wisdome, and
precepts of vertue, as they grow; and withall, to imprint
the Latin so in their minds therby, as hardly to be forgottē.
               26. To answer concerning the matter contained in
their Lectures, in the Latin of their Authors, from the
lowest fourmes and so vpward.
               27. To construe anie ordinarie Author ex tempore.
               28. To come to that facilitie and ripenesse, as not onely
to translate leisurely and with some meditation, both into
English and Latin, as before in the sections 10. and 11. but
more also, to reade anie easie Author forth of Latin into

English, and out of English to reade it into Latin againe, as
Corderius, Terence, Tullies Offices, &c. To do this in
Authors and places which they are not acquainted with, and
almost as fast as they are able, to reade the Author alone.
               29. To write fa
                     •
                  re, in Secretarie, 
                     〈◊〉

                     〈…〉
                  .
               30. To 
                     •
                  aue all the principall 
                     〈…〉
                   Latin,
Greek and Hebrue, with the etymologies both Latin and
Greek: 
                     〈…〉
                  
worthie helpes and meanes to be had in the Vniuersities.
               31. To be acquainted with the grounds of Religion, and
to haue the summe, and all the chiefe Histories of the Bible.
To take all the substance of the Sermons, if they be plainly
and orderly deliuered: and to set them downe afterwards in
a good Latin style, or to reade them extempore into Latin out
of the English. To conceiue and answer the seuerall points of
the Sermons, and how to make a briefe repetition of the
whole Sermon without booke.
               32. To be set in the high way to attaine to the puritie and
perfection of the Latine tongue by their further labour aud
practise in the Vniuersitie: hauing both the rules & grounds
thereof, and also varietie of the best phrase meete and necessarie
for them.
               33 To grow in our owne English tongue, according to
their ages, and growths in other learning: to vtter their

                     〈◊〉
                   in the same, both in propriety, and purity; and so to
be fitted for diuinity, law, or what other calling or faculty
soeuer they shalbe after employed in.
               34 Finally, thus to proceed together with the tongs; in
the vnderstanding and knowledge of the learning, or matter
contained in the same, to become alike expert, in all good
learning, meete for their yeares and studies; that so proceeding

still, after they are gone from the Grammar Schooles,
they may become most exquisite in all kinds of good learning,
to which they shall be applied.
               These things may be effected in good sort, through Gods
blessing, in the seuerall fourmes, as the scholars proceed, by
so manie in each fourme as are apt and industrious, onely by
the directions in the Grammar schoole constantly obserued.
If the Maisters being of any competent sufficiencie will take
meete paines: and the Scholars being set to schoole, so soone
as they shall be meete, be kept to learning daily, without
loitering, hauing bookes and other necessarie helpes and encouragements:
and by their par
                     •
                  nts care caused to do their
exercises at home, and be euer kept in meete awe, and submission
to their Maisters. But out of these I will extract
onely those which I take most necessarie and profitable for
schooles (not to trouble with ouer manie) and set them
downe briefly in the Grammar Schoole. That so all scholars
of anie towardnesse and diligence, may be made good Grammarians
and euerie way fit for the Vniuersitie by fifteene
years of age, or at least by that time that they shall be meete
by discretion and gouernment, which is commonly sixteene
or seuenteene. And all this to be done with delight aud certaintie,
both to Maisters and Scholars; with strife and contention
amongest the Scholars themselues, without that vsuall
terrour and crueltie, which hath bene practised in
manie plaees, and without so much as seueritie amongst
good natures.
               How greatly all this must needs tend to the furtherance
of the publike good, euerie one may iudge; which it will d

still, so much the more as the Lord vouchsafeth a further
supply, to the seuerall meanes and courses after set downe,
by adjoining daily moe helpes and experiments, especially of
the learned. Of whom my hope is stil, according to my earnest

desire, that they will lend their helping hands, to the full
perfecting of so profitable a worke.
               For the vndoubted certaintie hereof, and of each particular,
first reade and consider of the meanes aright, then
try according to the directions in their seuerall places in the
Grammar Schoole, and so giue sentence.

                  ❧ Helps for attaining to those
things mentioned in the
Contents.
               
                  THese helps God hath prouided for our
Grammar-schooles, more then in former
times, or at least more then are commonly
knowne and vsed in them: whereof
experience teacheth, that there may be
excellent furtherance in a right vse of them, for all the
seuerall parts of good learning in Schooles, for obtaining
the same more speedily, easily, surely & profitably:
and namely for thus running through all our ordinary
classicall-schoole authors, and attaining to the best exercises
and faculties in Schooles, as any one shall haue
occasion to vse them.
               First, for the more speedy and right reading of English,
and so leading the childe as by the hand to the
Grammar schoole, as a preparatiue thereto.
               
                  The English-schoolemaister, of that honest and painfull
Maister Coote.
               
               There is also a little Briefe, of a sheet of paper named,
A Plaine Method for speedy learning to reade, by Iohn
Merest: of whose directions there might be very good
vse, if his Rules and style were amended by some Scholar,
and brought to perfection.
               Other directions and helps for teaching to reade, see
in the Grammar-schoole, chap. 3. For further growth
of young Scholars in our English tongue, to expresse

their mindes in proprietie and puritie, for their proceeding
therein, as they proceede in Latine: and also for
them who would teach strangers our language, or
learne it. See after.
               Secondly, for better learning the Accidence and first
grounds of Grammar (whereas children are vsually very
long in getting their Accidence, and oft, when they
haue done it, are little the better for it, especially for the
vnderstanding and right vse of it) to the end that the
learner may get it sooner & more profitably: for a right
vnderstanding and vse thereof, and for answering any
necessary question belonging to it, and for better keeping
all in memory, to be able thereby to proceed most
speedily, pleasantly and certainely in their construction,
is prouided the Booke called
               The posing of the Parts. as also
               
               M. Leeches questions of Accidence and Grammar.
               Other helps, especially for directing the Maisters, see
in the Grammar-schoole, Chap. 6.
               Thirdly, for more speedy construing the Latin Grammar,
to saue much labour therein, and for keeping the
same with ease, which is otherwise very hard to the
children, and ouer troublesome to the Maister, Lillies
rules construed.
               Fourthly, for better conceiuing, vnderstanding, applying,
and making vse of all our Grammar rules.
               The Grammar of this last Impression hauing the
summes of the Rules in the margents more perfectly and
fully then formerly, and in the Syntax, the words noted
wherein the force of each ensample lieth. In the first
Impression of them many things were mistaken and
corrupted in the printing.
               Fiftly,2. For the speedy and profitable learning all our first and lowest school authors, Gram. translations. For speedy and profitable learning of all our

first and lowest Schoole-bookes and Authors, (whereas
children are commonly very long in learning some little
peece of them, as of Sententiae pueriles, Coufabulatiunculae,
Cato, &c. and so the rest; and when they haue learned
them through with much toyle to themselues and
their Maisters, they are commonly little the better for
them, for any good vse, and doe after presently forget
them, for the most part;) to the end that they may soone
runne thorow all of them, or so much as shalbe thought
good, and that for construing, parsing, vnderstanding,
reading them forth of Latine into English, or forth of
English into Latine; for making the same Latine, and
prouing it; and finally, for leading the learner by the
hand with delight, vntill hee be able to go of himselfe
by ordinary helpes,Books grammatically translated. with much lesse trouble to the
Maister, are prouided Grammaticall translations of
them, as namely; first, of Sententiae pueriles: Confabulatiunculae
pueriles: Corderius dialogues chiefly for the
ready helpe of speaking Latin of ordinary matters in a
very good and pure phrase.
               
                  Catoes morall Disticks, with the Sentences adioyned,
and also Isocrates ad Daemonicum, translated into latine

booke of Tullies Offices: part of Ouids Metamorphosis:

                        •
                     es, with that excellent booke De Aptbus,
of the gouernement and ordering of Bees.
               All these are made so plaine,Plainnesse & readinesse of these translations. as that children, if they
be any thing studious, and well trained vp in the first
grounds of Grammar, by the former helpes, may with a
little direction, euer prepare their lectures afore-hand
at home ouer-night: such peeces (I meane) as they are
to learne in lectures; and that, as was said, fo
                     •
                   euerie
good vse, without neede of other Commentaries in

any of them, or so much helpe of the Maister as is
vsuall. So that they will, by the helpe of them, fall to
their priuate studies of themselues. And for things to be
learned without booke, namely their Authors in verse
so translated, they will be able thereby so to keep them,
as by the meanes thereof, and their other helpes, from
quarter to quarter, to say them without booke, construe,
and to giue all the chiefe difficulties of them, with a very
little priuate labour, thus to keep them better in memorie,
and haue vse of them continually.
               Hereof I might giue you instances of experiments,
according to which you might iudge of them; but I
passe them ouer, standing vpon so euident grounds of
reason, as hath bene shewed before, and as I shall more
fully manifest (God willing) in the Grammar-Schoole,
chap. 8. where I shall set downe the vse of them, with th
                     •
                  
benefit in a right practise.
               If you desire a praxis of all or most of the chiefe rules
of the Syntax or construction shortly comprized, take
Maister Leeches Dialogues,For a practise of the chiefe rules of construction, Maister Leeches Dialogues
                   set downe in the end of his
Grammar-questions: which Dialogues are so contriued
of purpose for children to that end: and so likewise
translated into English, as they may be gone through
for each good vse so soone as any of the former.
               By that time that children haue gone through these
bookes so translated, and haue by this practise attained
vnto the knowledge and right vse of their Grammar
rules, especially that golden rule of Construing: for
construing, parsing, &c. they will be able, easily, with
much lesse toyle of the Maister, to go through all other
classicall-Schoole-Authors, by such helpes and meanes
as God hath further prouided.
               For speedy running ouer the rest of the lower schooleFor the rest of the lower Schoole-authors, other translations.
                  
bookes, which are not so translated grammatically:
first, the other translations of them may be of very good
vse thus farre foorth. As namely, first to giue the learners
some light for the right vnderstanding & meaning
of the Authors (which vnderstanding of the matter is a
maine foundation for the speedy attaining to any such
learning, especially for getting the Languages, as I haue
shewed elsewhere) as also for resoluing the Authors,
and affoording some good English phrase, with varietie
thereof to expresse their minds. And withall, that by the
right vse of such translations, they may the more easily
learne the manner of our vsuall translating of Authors,
or anie other worke, respecting onely the matter and
intent of the Author, whereof our commonest vse is:
and so for reading forth of Latin into our owne tongue,
to expresse the sense onely, not directly, verbatim, or
grammatically, but obseruing perfect sense, good phrase,
and purity of our tongue, and so back againe out of the
English into a good Latine style in like manner. For the
right learning of these Authors doth not so much consist
in the construing and parsing of them, as in getting
by them the matter, phrase and style of the Author, and
to these ends and purposes amongst others, as I take it,
they haue bene translated, and are many of them vnknowne
to most.
               
                  The Translations are these.
                  1. For the rest of Tullies Offices,
                     For the rest of Tullies Offices not translated grammatically, M. Grimmalds translation. which are not translated
grammatically; as namely the two latter bookes,
Maister Grimmald his translation, which yet would be
much more profitable to this end, to them who would
make vse of it, if the English were separated from the
Latine, set in a booke by it selfe, as the Grammaticall
and other translations vsually are.

                  Prouided alwayes,Caution to be vsed in this and other authors. that this be with great caution,
for auoyding all danger of corrupting their manners by
lasciuiousnesse or otherwise; considering the pronenesse
of our nature, like to tinder or gunpowder, if neuer

light: first, for the true vnderstanding of the Author, but
also to expresse the same in the best and fittest words in

a pure English phrase; and likewise for notable obseruations

principall vse of the booke.

                  This booke, as it is wel knowne to be the purest style,
and an excellent history for matter of warre and martiall
affaires, and therefore most necessary for our dayes,
for the better helping to preserue the Church of God
and our natiue countrey; so it is difficult for children, in
regard of the subiect, viz. matter of warre, which they
are not acquainted with. Yet by the Translation rightly
vsed, it is made so plaine & easie, that children of twelue
or thirteene yeares of age, rightly trained vp, may be able
to go through it for all the vses mentioned in short
space, and much more others of riper iudgement. So
that it were great pitty, in regard of the benefit that may
come by it to all sorts, that so worthy a worke should
lie hid as it were, being vnknowne to the greatest part.

                  Greeke.
                  Whereas there is nothing in any tongue for the perfect
obtaining of it,For speedy attaining to the Greeke. but Grammar, words, and practise
of them in a right composing and setting them together:
I meane, first, the knowledge of the Grammar
rules, belonging to that tongue; words to expresse the
minde, and practise of both in reading Authors, and in
writing; for most easie and speedy attaining to the Greek
tongue, which hath bene wont to be so difficult and tedious:
God hath prouided these readie helpes.
                  1. For the Grammar,For the Grammar Maister Camdens most profitable for vs. Maister Camdens is of all other
most easie and profitable (as I take it) like as for
Westminster, so for all our schooles; for that it followes
the order of our Latine Grammar most directly, chiefly
in the Syntax, wherein many of the rules are the very
same, or neare vnto them. The Anomalies in the Verbs
being set alphabetically, so as they may be found very
readily; and the Dialects set directly after the order of
the Declensions and Coniugations, that by it alone
well studied, most difficulties may be easily vnderstood
and answered.

                  For a most speedy attaining to the Hebrue.
                  1. For the Grammar,For Hebrue Grammar. though euery one may take
for his owne vse what Grammar he hath learned, or is
most familiarly acquainted with, and supply out of others
what is wanting therein; yet for him that is newly
to beginne, or desires most easily to teach or direct others
                        Martinius printed by R
                              •
                           
                           phalengius at Berne.
                     
I take (vnder better iudgement) Martinius to be
the best. My reasons are,
                  1. For that it is most methodicall,Reason of it. proceeding according
to the right order of Nature and rules of Art.
                  2. For that it hath answering vnto it, Maister Vdals
Hebrue Grammar in English, being in effect a meere
translation of Martinius, onely leauing out some things
which he thought lesse necessary, and making most
things in Martinius very plaine, in stead of a Commentary,
as the translations do the Authors.
                  3. For that the Martinius Grammar printed by Raphalengius
and by Abrahamus VVeerlinus at Berne, haue
a Praxis adioyned, for the parsing of three Psalmes, viz.
the 1. 25. and 68, like as Maister Vdals hath in English:
which Praxis is so orderly for the right examining or analysing
of euery word according to the order of nature
and art, and according as all things are set downe
in the Grammar in order of the Chapters, that they
leade the learner directly, as by the hand, to the plaine
parsing and resoluing of those three Psalmes; and by
them, auy other part of the Hebrue Bible.
                  And lastly, for that Maister Vdals Grammar, (which
I commend as a short Commentarie to it) hath also a
briefe Epitome of the Hebrue Lexicon adioyned, for
the more speedy finding out any word, and so attaining
the tongue.
                  
                     
Or in stead of Martinius,

and much sooner gotten, for the vse of it, and also
may be readily deliuered and vttered in Latine, at least
by comparing with Martinius.

learned, haue much and long complained, that in most
Schooles there hath bene litle care, to teach Scholars to
expresse their mindes readily in proprietie and puritie
of speech, so to helpe to adorne our owne tongue;

whole Latine sentences to be placed in the page opposite

many of the Sentences in Latine do onely expresse the
sense, and so set the learner at a stand, or carry him quite

words to the English, and contrarily, so to serue

to keepe all perfectly, without any trouble or charge
of memorie, through the help of the perfect vnderstanding
