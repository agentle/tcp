            To the Chriſtian
Reader. S.
            
               IN this place both to ſatiſfie
thee, beloued, and that
thou alſo the better maiſt,
if it pleaſe thee, anſwere
mine aduerſaries, I thinke
it my part to ſhow the reaſons
of my tranſlating, correcting, and adorning
this booke. For ſome perhaps, to
tranſlate that which is once done alreadie,
wil thinke it vanitie; to amend that which
no godlie man would euer enterpriſe to
correct, wil iudge it preſumption; and to
adorne that which was, though often imprinted,
yet neuer ſo put-forth, wil deeme
it curioſitie. And ſo I ſhal be counted vane
for my tranſlating; ouer-bold for my correcting;
and verie curious for my quoting
this booke. It ſtands me therefore vpon to
ſhow the cauſes of dooing what I haue
done; wherein I wil be the more briefe,
becauſe elſe-whereIn the Epiſtle dedicatorie before S. Augustines Priuate talke with God: and alſo in the ſecond Epistle before the Imitation of Christ. I haue ſomwhat touched
theſe general points, and what there
I haue ſpoken hath apt relation vnto this
place.
            And firſt for my tranſlating (to ouer-paſſe
in ſilence the wel acceptation of S. Auguſtines
Priuate talke with God,
               Cauſes why this booke was tranſlated, being in Engliſh before. by the godlie
zelous, for whoſe ſake I did beſtowe my
paines; and the approbation of the ſame
by the Honorable of famous memorie maſter
Secretarie Wilſon, for whoſe iudgement
ſake chieflie, which I knew was verie
learned and ſound, I choaſe him to be Patrone
thereof: ſufficient cauſes both to
encourage me to go forward, and to cleere

me from al ſuſpition either of vanitie, preſumption,
or curioſitie for doing as I haue
done) I ſaie, the rather I put this booke into
Engliſh, for that I ſaw the other, before
in our vulgar tongue (whoſoeuer was the
tranſlator of the ſame, or what copie ſoeuer
the Printer folowed) was verie vnperfect;
as by comparing this my tranſlation
with the other in Engliſh, and both with
the Latine copie, may eaſilie appeere. And
therfore that neither the aduerſarie might
haue iuſt occaſion to carpe; nor the godlie
to complaine hence-foorth that it is not
perfected, I thought good faithfulie to
tranſlate the ſame. Furthermore were nothing
at al, as more than halfe was left-out,
yet good cauſe I had to tranſlate it, both
becauſe of the errors therein contained,
which were neceſſarilie to be corrected;
and of the manifold ſentences of holie
ſcripture comprehended therein, which
were needful to be quoted. So that, both
that the godlie might not be either infected,
or offended by the one; and that manie
might be allured to reade, and in reading
confirmed by the other, I tooke the
tranſlation thereof vpon me, for otherwiſe
neither could the faults be rightlie amended,
nor the places dulie applied.
            Secundarilie,Cauſes of correcting this booke. my correcting of this
booke, I haue hope no good man wil miſlike.
For I did it not raſhlie of preſumption,
but with the teſtimonie of a good conſcience;
with the warrant of God his word;
and after the example too of ſuch, who for
doing the like are not diſpraiſed. For if the
Spirit of God command vs, To trie euerie

Spirit

                     •
                  
               ; to trie al things, and to keepe that
which is good
               1. Theſ. 5. verſe. 21.; to doe al things vnto edification
               1. Cor. 14. verſe. 26., not vnto the deſtruction of ſoules;
&, if both thoſe noble & good men of Berea
did examine the doctrine euen of the
Apoſtles themſeluesAct. 17, 10. 11.; and diuers godlie
men in our age haue tried, and purged the
writings of other men, & that to the great
benefit of the Church, and their owne
commendation: I truſt I am not blame
worthie for trieng, and for chuſing that
which good is, and refuſing that which either
might infect, or be offenſiue to the
godlie, but ſhould do verie il, both againſt
God, againſt man, and againſt my conſcience
too, if I did not ſo, hauing both ſo holie
a commander to obeie, and ſo worthie
examples to imitate. Againe, by the cenſure
euen of anie indifferent iudge, I may
with as good, and better auctoritie either
quite-omit, or Chriſtianlie conuert that
which il is vnto good purpoſe, than ſome
euil diſpoſed perſons either altogether
leaue-out, or wickedlie change that which
good is to the ingraffing of il opinions; as
did both Io. Baptist a Ficklerus a Papiſt in his
handeling that booke entituled, De iure
Magistratus in Subditos; and alſo Iohan. de
Ales another Papiſt in corrupting the holie
Pſalmes of Dauid, and applieng them
moſt ſacrilegiouſlie vnto the virgine Marie.
And thus brieflie for my correction in
general.
            Now furthermore would be ſhowed particularlie
what I haue corrected;What things corrected. how I
haue corrected the ſame; and why. The
places which I haue corrected, be either

manifeſtlie erroneous; or ſcapes vnwittinglie,
for ſo charitie and circumſtances
wil me to iudge, committed.
            
               Of the former ſort be praiers which tend
either to make works meritorious,
               Faults manifestlie erroneous.

               ris, &c. Such is the
whole 19. Chap. in a maner after the Latine
copie, and finalie, ſo be theſe, and ſuch like,
(for to recite al the words, I thinke it not
conuenient) in another
               Medit. cap. 41., Hei mihi, quia videre
non potui Dominum angelorum, humiliatum
ad cōuerſationem hominū, &c. Vtinam cum felice
Ioſeph Dominū meū de cruce depoſuiſſem, aromatibus
condijſſem, in ſepulchro collocaſſem, &c.
            In which my correction, I haue had ſpecial
care to leaue as little out as might be,Maner of correcting this Booke.
and therefore did I thinke it better to
change vnto good purpoſe that which is
contrarie vnto the Chriſtian faith, where
aptlie I could ſo do, than quite to omit
whatſoeuer was amiſſe. In which reſpect I
haue changed the 24. Chapter after the Latine
copie in my traſlation, the 23. which is
a praier vnto Saincts, as alſo theſe words,

               Propter merita, & orationes, &c.
               Medit. cap. 36., and applied
them vnto Chriſt. The other errors I
haue quite left out. Likewiſe among the
ſcapes, ſome things I haue omitted, and
ſome things I haue changed. I haue omitted
the whole 19. Chap. in the Latine copie,
which is the cauſe I haue one Chapter
leſſe in my tranſlation, than is in the Latine:
and alſo theſe words, and the reſt tending
to the like effectMedit. cap. 41., Hei mihi quia videre non
potui Dominum angelorum, humiliatum ad conuerſationem
hominum, &c. vtinam cum felice Ioſeph
Dominum meū de cruce depoſuiſſem, aromatibus
codijſſem, in ſepulchro collocaſſem, &c. That
which I haue altered, are ye reſt ſpecified afore:
the onlie difference betwene the Latine
copie and mine in thoſe places is, for
that I turne the preſent tence into the preterperfect
tence, which agreeth to ye truth.
            It remaineth now that I do yeeld the reaſons
why I haue corrected theſe faults.Special reaſons of correcting the errors and ſcapes in this booke. And
firſt for the errors: the chiefeſt cauſes of
my correcting them was, for that they be
contrarie to Scripture, and might both infect
the ſimple, and coole the zeale euen of
the ſtrong; but another was, becauſe I ſaw
manie places in this booke did ouerthrow
them quite. As firſt the places for merits
are ouerthrowne, as by other, ſo eſpecialie
by theſe, I acknowledge that no penance can
ſatisfie for my ſinnes
               Auguſt. praiers. ch. 38. pa. 198., and againe, If thou examineſt
my righteouſnes, lo, I ſtinke like dead carion
               Auguſt. praiers. ch. 39. pa. 206.. Secondlie, interceſsion vnto Saints,
with praieng vnto the dead, is ouerthrowne
by theſe and ſuch like places, What other
interceſſor ſhould I direct vnto thee, but euen him
               Auguſt. praiers. ch. 
                     •
                  . pag. 23., who is the reconciliation for our ſinnes, and ſitteth

at thy right hand, making requeſt for vs. For,
what is it to cal vnto the truth in truth
               Auguſt. in the ſame cha. pa. 21., but euen
to cal vnto the Father in the name of the
Sonne (not of Saincts 
                  
                     
                  
                  reversed ?
               ) There is nothing behinde
to adde, for I haue ſent mine whole hope
vnto thee
               Auguſt. praiers. ch. 8. pag. 35.. I haue directed thy beloued Sonne
mine aduocate, vnto thee, and haue ſent thy glorious
child to be a mediator betweene me and
thee: I haue ſent I ſaie an interceſſor, through
whome (not through Marie, or anie other
Sainct) I hope to get pardon. For what is more
acceptable
               Auguſt. praiers. ch. 5. pag. 21., than to cal vpon the begetter in the
name of his onlie begotten? to moue the Father vnto
mercie, in the recordation of his Sonne? to mitigate
the wrath of the King, through naming of
his deere child? &c. Thirdlie, praieng that the
faithful departed out of this life, may
haue reſt, is alſo in diuers places ouerthrowne,
as where it is ſaidAuguſt. praiers. ch. 22. pag. 90., Happie is the
ſoule; which departing from the earthlie bodie, goeth
directlie into heauen, ſecure it is, and quiet,
&c! Oh happie are al thy Saincts, o Chriſt, which
haue paſſed ouer the ſea of this mortalitie
               Auguſt. praiers. ch. 23. pag. 93., & attained
vnto the hauen of perpetual quietnes, ſecuritie,
and peace, where they are at reſt, and alwaie
ioiful, & merie! And therfore conſidering this
contrarietie in ye Auctor, I thought it beſt
to publiſh thoſe things which were conſonant
to ye true faith, and to omit whatſoeuer
ſauored either of hereſie, or ſuperſtition.
            And for the ſcapes, I am to yeeld the
ſame reaſon, which I haue giuen for my
correcting the errors. For as they, for the
moſt part, be contrarie vnto the Scriptures:
ſo be diuers places in this booke, as
eaſelie I could ſhowe, againſt them. I except
onlie the ſcapes contained in the 41.

Chapter after the Latine copie: the which,
as alſo the other ſcapes and errors, I am
perſuaded, were the Auctor liuiug, hee
would gladlie either amend himſelfe, or
ſuffer them to be reformed. I often make
mention of the Latine copie, becauſe that
hath one Chapter more than this hath,
which commeth to paſſe by leauing out
the 19. Chapter.
            Thirdlie,Cauſes of quoting this booke with places of Scripture. and laſt of al, I haue adorned
this booke with places of Scripture, both
to ſhow from whence that which good is
both is, and ought to be taken: and alſo to
moue the zealous Chriſtian the more earneſtlie
to reade this booke. For when it is
apparent, that praiers, and meditations be
deriued out of the pure fountane of Gods
holie word, manie are not a little not onelie
pricked forward vnto the reading, but
alſo ſtrengthened and comforted much in
mind, when they doe reade them.
            Which being ſo, I truſt thou wilt accept
my trauel in good part, and at the leaſtwiſe
reade this booke as diligentlie now, being
both made perfect, corrected, and adorned,
a
                  •
                earſt thou haſt done when it neither had
ſo manie praiers in it by halfe as now it
hath; nor was ſo pure fró error
                  •
               ; nor ſo auctorized
with the warrant of Gods word
for the comfort of thy ſoule, as now it is.
            And thus I commend both thee and my
ſelfe into his hands who hath not onelie
made, but alſo redeemed vs for his owne
glorie, and praiſe.

               Chap. 3.
               A complaint of a ſinner, whoſe
praier God heareth not in reſpect
of his diſobedience.
               
                  FOr he that is worthie
hatred, how
can he require mercie!
he which hath
deſerued paine, how can he deſire

glorie!
               He prouoketh the iudge, that
laieng ſatisfaction for his offence
apart, ſueth to be honored
with rewards. Who ſo is
condemned to puniſhment, is
too bold with the King, if hee
ſeeke to be crowned with an
vndeſerued garland. That fooliſh
child doth prouoke the
ſweete affection of his louing
father vnto wrath, that after reproches
offered, wil vſurpe the
dignitie of inheritāce, before he
haue repented him of his fault.
               O my FatherMal. 2, 10. Math. 5, 48., why cal I into
mind what I haue done? I haue
deſerued death, and I beg life. I
haue mooued my KingPſalm. 5, 2. Pſal. 44, 4., whoſe
aſſiſtance impudentlie I doe
craue. I haue deſpiſed the iudge
Iob. 9, 15. Pſalm. 50, 6. Eſai. 33, 22., and yet raſhlie I beſeech him
to be mine helper. Proudlie I
haue refuſed to heare my father,
whom notwithſtanding I preſume

to haue mine helper.
               Wo is me, how late do I
come; alas, alas, how ſlowlie
do I haſten; wo is me, becauſe
I runne after woundes, refuſing
being whole to auoide the darts.
               I haue neglected to fore-ſee
the dartes, but now am troubled
ſtanding at deathes dore.
               I haue encreaſed my wounds,
becauſe I haue not feared to
adde ſinne vnto ſinne.
               With a freſh wound I haue
embrued my ſcars, becauſe I
haue augmented mine olde
ſinnes by my dailie tranſgreſſions;
& what God by his medicines
had healed, I by my frantike
ſcratching haue opened.
               The skin which going ouer
the woundes, did hide the diſeaſe,
through ye breaking out of
the corruption, is become rotten,
in aſmuch as wickednes vſed
againe, made ye mercie once

granted to be of none effect.
               For I knowe it is written, At
what time ſoeuer the righteous
man ſhal commit wickednes, al
his righteouſnes which he hath
done ſhal not be mentionedEzech. 18, verſe. 24..
Now if the righteouſnes of a
righteous man through ſin ſhal
be forgotten; how much more
ſhal the repentance of a ſinner
turning again vnto wickednes!
               How often haue I a dog returned
vnto the vomitPro 26, 11.; and like a
ſow wallowed in the mire2. Pet. 2, verſe. 22.!
               I acknowledge, becauſe for me
particularlie to remember al it

to ſin, which knew not what
ſin meant; manie that were bent
to ſin, I haue perſuaded thervnto;
ſuch as haue reſiſted, I haue
cōpelled; & haue conſented to
thē as haue gone about wickednes.
Snares I haue laid for them
which haue kept the right waie;

and made a pit for ſuch as haue
ſought the ſame: yea I made no
conſcience of committing ſin, &
feared not to forget thy lawes.

contagion being thrown away,
may reſtore mee againe to my

yet could our amends be
nothing correſpondent to thy

This verelie is al mine hope, and

where a piece of my ſelfe is,
there, I truſt, I do raigne; where
my fleſh is glorified, there I
knowe I am glorious; where my
fleſh doth rule, there I perceaue
I haue dominion.
               And although I am yet a ſinner:

yet I doubt not of this participation
of grace; although
my ſinnes doe hinder me; yet
my ſubſtance doth require it;
and although mine offences exclude
me; yet the communion
of nature doth not repel me.
               For God is not ſo hard harted
that he can forget fleſh & blood
which he beareth; which for my
ſake he hath taken; which on
my behalfe he requireth.
               But the Lord our God is mild,
and verie gentleIoēl. 2, 23.; he loueth his

of our blood: we are his

members, and his fleſh: finalie,
he is our headEph. 4, 15. 16. Eph. 5, 23., of which the

we haue great cauſe to cleaue

                  MY ſoule, praiſe thou ye
LordPſa. 103, 1. and al that is
within me, praiſe his

holie Name.
               My ſoule,Pſal. 103, 2. 22. praiſe thou the Lord,
and forget not al his benefits.
               Praiſe ye Lord, al ye his works,
in al places of his dominion: my
ſoule praiſe thou the Lord.
               Praiſe we the Lord, whom Angels
praiſeReu. 7, 11. 12., dominions adorePhil. 2, 9. 10.,
powers doe reuerence; to whom
the Cherubims, and Scraphims
continualie do crieEſaie. 6, 3., Holie, Holie,
Holie.
               Ioine we therefore our voices
to the voices of the holie Angels;
and according to our abilitie,
let vs praiſe the GOD
which we both haue. For they,
whoſe eies euermore bee fixed
vpon the Lord, whom they behold
not through a glaſſe darklie
1. Cor. 13, verſe. 12. but face vnto face; they doe
moſt purelie and without ceaſing
praiſe the Lord.
               But who can, yea ſo much as
in thought comprehend, much

leſſe in words expreſſe, what an
infinit multitude of thoſe bleſſed
ſpirits, and celeſtial powers
are in the preſence of the Lord
God almightie! Or what continual
ioie they receaue by the
ſight of God! what euerlaſting
mirth! what heate of loue, not
to their griefe, but to their delectation!
what a deſire is in them
of the ſight of God with ſatietie;
& a ſatietie with deſire, in whom
neither deſire ingendreth griefe,
nor ſatietie bringeth loathing!
How bleſſed they are by cleauing
to thy ſoueraigne bleſſednes!
How they be made light,
ioined to the true light! Finalie,
alwaie beholding the vnchangeable
Trinitie, they be conuerted
into an vnchangable nature!
               But when ſhal we be able to
comprehend the glorious condition
of the Angels; when we
are not able to ſearch out the

nature of our owne ſoules!
               What is this thing which can
quicken the fleſh; and yet voluntarilie
can not bind it ſelfe to
holie cogitations! what kind of
thing is this which is ſo ſtrong,
and yet ſo weake; ſo ſmal, and
yet ſo mightie, that it ſearcheth
out the ſecrets of God, and beholdeth
celeſtial things; which
for mans behoofe is wel knowne
to haue, through ſharpenes of
wit, inuented the knowledge of
manie ſciences? what kind of
thing is this then which knoweth
ſo much of other things, and yet
is vtterlie ignorant how it ſelfe
was made?
               For although much be ſpoken
doubtfulie of ſome, concerning
the beginning of the ſoule: yet
we find how it is a certaine intellectual
ſpirit made through
the power of the Creator; liuing
euerlaſtinglie in her kind; quickening

the mortal bodie which
it ſuſtaineth; ſubiect to alteration;
prone to forgetfulnes; which
feare manie times trobleth, and
mirth puffeth vp.
               O ſtrange thing, moſt woorthie
to be woondred at! Of God
the Creator of al thingsGen. 1, 1. 2, &c. Iohn. 1, 1. 2. 3. Heb. 1, 1. 2., who is
incomprehenſible1. Kin. 8, 27, and vnutterable,
al doubtfulnes laid apart,
we reade great things and
verie maruelous, we ſpeake, and
write alſo: yet whatſoeuer we
ſaie, either of Angels, or of the
ſoules of men, we can not ſo eaſilie
approoue the ſame.
               But omit we theſe things, and
mount we; leaue we, and ouerpaſſe
we whatſoeuer is created;
and let vs direct the eies of our
faith vpon him who hath made
al things.
               Wherfore I wil make degrees
of aſcenſion in mine hart; and
therby mount vp vnto my ſoule;

and by my ſoule and vnderſtanding
aſcend vnto my Lord, who
abideth aboue ouer mine head.
               Let whatſoeuer is either viſiblie
ſeene, or ſpiritualie imagined,
with a ſtrong hand be far awaie
remoued from the ſight of
mine hart & mind: onlie let the
pure vnderſtanding, going on
plainelie, attaine ſwiftlie vnto
him who is the Creator both of
AngelsPſa. 148, 1. 2. 5., and of ſoulesGen. 1, 26. 27. 1. Cor. 11, 7. Col. 3, 10., and of
al things beſideGen. 1, 1. 2. 3, &c. Heb. 1, 2.
               Bleſſed is that mind which forſaketh
baſe things belowe; and
ſeeketh after hie things; which
maketh a neſt in the rocke, and
from the high cliffe with Egles
eies beholdeth the Sonne of
righteouſnes.
               For nothing is ſo goodlie, and
ſo comfortable, as with the ſight
of the mind, and deſire of hart to
behold the verie Lord alone;
and after a maruelous manner

inuiſiblie to behold the inuiſible
1. Tim. 1, 17: and ſo to taſte another, not
this ſweetenes; and to ſee another,
not this light.
               Becauſe this light, which is encloſed
in a place, is ended by
time, and changed by the interruption
of nights, and is common
with vs to wormes and
beaſts; and, to ſaie the truth, in
compariſon of that ſoueraigne
light, can not be called light indeede,
but night rather.
            
            
               Chap. 27.
               VVhat it is to hold, and to behold
God in part; and how we
are to conceiue of God.
               
                  AND although that
ſoueraigne and vnchangable
eſſence,
that true light, that
laſting light, that light of Angels
can be ſeene of none in this
life (for that preeminence is reſerued

for the Saints in celeſtial
glorie:) yet firmelie to beleeue,
and to vnderſtand, & to marke,
and zealouſlie to couet for the
ſame, is after a ſort to hold, and
to behold the ſame.
               Let the voice therefore ſound
aboue the Angels; and let man
with an intentiue mind behold
God, and praiſe him with words
as wel as he can.
               For it is meete that the creature
doe praiſe his Creator. Becauſe
he hath made vs to praiſe
himEſai. 43, 7., who ſtandeth not in need

of celeſtial contemplation let
the zealous man, and the beholder
of heauenlie matters refreſh

or els what, which properlie

is caled God, do equalie
agree to al the perſons: as great
God, almightie, eternal, and generalie
al things, which naturalie
are ſpoken of God.
               So that there is no name of
nature, which ſo may agree vnto
thee God the Father, but the
ſame alſo may fitlie be referred
vnto the Sonne, & holie Ghoſt.
               We ſaie how thou the Father
art naturalie God, ſo is the
Sonne naturalie God, and the
holie Ghoſt naturalie; and yet
not three Gods, but one God
naturalie, ye Father, the Sonne,
and the holie Ghoſt.
               And therefore, ô God holie
Trinitie, in perſons thou art inſeparable,
in ſenſe are they to
be vnderſtood, though in ſound
you haue ſeparable names: for
you receaue no plural number
in the names of nature.
               For hereby is it declared, how

name of euerie perſon, reſpecteth

               If I ſaie the Father, I point vnto
the Sonne; if I name the
Sonne, I preſuppoſe a Father; if
I mention the holie ſpirit, I muſt
neceſſarilie vnderſtand of whom
he is the Spirit, namelie of the
Father and of the Sonne.
               For this is the true faith, proceeding
from ſound doctrine:
this vndoubtedlie is the catholike
and right faith, which God
of his goodnes hath taught me

               O good Lord, ſometime I remember
that good woman Anna1. Sam. 1, verſe. 18.,
which came vnto the tabernacle
to beg a ſonne of God,
of whome the Scripture teſtifieth,
how after her teares and
praiers, ſhe looked no more ſad:
but when I remember ſo great
virtue, and ſuch conſtancie of
that woman, I am troubled in
mind, and do bluſh againe, becauſe
I behold how I wretch do
grouel too much downeward.
               For if a woman did ſo weepe,
and continue in weeping, and
that for a ſonne; how ſhould my
ſoule weepe, yea and perſiſt in
weeping, which ſeeketh, and loueth

God, yea and longeth too
for to come vnto him! How
ſhould the ſoule both groane,
and be greeued, that ſeeketh after
God night and daie! which
eſteemeth al things as naught
beſide Chriſt! for it is much
maruel, if teares be not the
meate of ſuch a ſoule daie and
night.
               Regard therefore, and ſhewe
mercie vpon me, for the dolors
of mine hart be increaſed.
               Giue me thine heauenlie comfort,
and deſpiſe not the ſinful
ſoule for which thou diedſt1. Tim. 1, verſe. 15..
               O giue, I beſeech thee, the inward
teares of hartie affection,
which may both loſe the fetters
of my ſinnes, and alſo repleniſh
my ſoule euermore with thy celeſtial
comfort.
               Gladlie would I atteine ſome
portion in thy kingdome, if not
among men aforetime, whoſe

ſteps I am vnable to imitate, yet
at the leaſt among religious
women.
               And here commeth into my
remembrance the woonderful
deuotion of other women, that
with a godlie affection ſought
thee in the graueMatt. 28, verſe. 1. 5. Mark. 16, 1. 2, &c., that, albe thy
diſciples departed, yet went not
from the ſepulchre, that ſate
there heauie lamenting, and
weeping much & a long while,
and riſing againe, with manie
teares oftentimes went and peeped
into the holes of the ſepulchre,
& verie diligentlie ſought
if anie where they could ſee
thee, whome earneſtlie they
ſought for.
               Manie times went they vnto
the graue, but to the louers too
much was not often enough; for
the virtue of a good worke is
perſeuerance: and becauſe aboue
the reſt they loued, both in

louing they wept, and in weeping
they ſought, and in ſeeking
they perſeuered, and therefore
they before al did find thee, ſaw
thee, and talke with thee.
               And not onlie ſo, but alſo they
carried the tidings of your glorious
reſurrection to ye diſciples
themſelues, according as you
bad, and warned them, ſaieng,
Go and tel my brethren, that
they go into Galile, and there
ſhal they ſee meMatt. 28, verſe. 10..
               If then the women ſo wept,
and in weeping perſeuered, that
ſought the liuing among the
dead, and by faith touched thee;
how ſhould the ſoule bewaile,
and in bewailing continue,
which in hart beleeueth, and
with mouth confeſſeth, how
thou her Sauior doſt rule in heauen,
and gouerne euerie-where!
how ſhould that ſoule weepe
and lament, which with her hart

loueth, and with al her whole deſire
longeth for thee!

of the diſtreſſed, to whome no
man ſueth, without hope of
mercie, giue me this grace for
thine owne ſake, and for thine
holie Name ſake, that as often
as I thinke of thee, ſpeake of
thee, write of thee, reade of thee,
confer of thee, as often as I remember
thee, ſerue thee, offer
the ſacrifice of praiſe vnto thee,

               O ſweete Ieſu, thinke not vpon
