               WAs not good Kyng Salamon
               Rauished in sondry wyse
               with euery liuelie Paragon
               That glistered before his eyes
               If this be true as trewe it was
               Lady lady.
               why should not I serue you alas
               My deare lady.
            
            
               When Paris was enamoured
               with Helena dame bewties peare
               whom Uenus first him promised
               To venter on and not to feare
               what sturdy stormes endured he
               Lady lady
               To winne her loue er it would be
               My deare ladye.
            
            
               Knowe ye not howe Troylus
               Languished and lost his ioye
               with fittes and feuers meruailous
               For Cresseda that dwelt in Troye
               Tyll pytie planted in her brest
               ladie ladie.
               To slepe with him & graunt him rest
               My deare ladie.
            
            
               I read somtime howe venterous
               Leander was his loue to please
               who swomme the waters perillous
               Of Abidon those surginge sease
               To come to her where as she lay
               ladie ladie.
               Tyll he was drowned by the waye
               my deare ladie.
            
            
               what say ye then to Priamus
               That promised his loue to mete
               And founde by fortune marueilous
               A bloudie cloth before his feete
               For Tysbies sake hym selfe he slewe
               ladie ladie
               To proue that he was a louer trewe
               my deare ladie.
            
            
               when Hercules for Eronie
               murdered a monster fell
               He put him selfe in ieoperdie
               Perillous as the stories tell
               Reske winge her vpon the shore
               ladie ladie.
               whiche els by lot had died therfore
               my deare ladie.
            
            
               An axaretis bewtifull
               when Iphis did beholde and see
               with sighes and sobbinges pitifull
               That Paragon longe wooed he
               And when he could not wynne her so
               Ladye ladye
               He went and honge him selfe for woe
               My deare ladye.
            
            
               Besides these matters marueilous
               Good Lady yet I can tell the more
               The Gods haue ben full amourous
               As Iupiter by learned lore
               who changed his shape as fame hath spred
               lady ladye.
               To come to Alcumenaes bed.
               My deare ladye.
            
            
               And if bewtie breed such blisfulnesse
               Enamouring both God and man
               Good Lady let no wilfulnesse
               Exuperate your bewtye then
               To slaye the hertes that yeld & craue
               ladye ladye
               The graunt of your goodwil to haue
               My deare ladye.
            
            Finis.
