                  had a lytel doughter of the age of vyenne the whyche was named ysabel / & so the fayre vyēne was nourysshed wyth the same ysabel from hyr tender age vnto many yere after / & soo grete loue was bytwene them bothe that they called eche other systers / & the fayre vyenne grewe and

                  Edward was amerous al redy of a noble lady of the courte of braban / but Parys as yet knewe nought of amorouste but not longe after Venus the goddes of loue fyred his thouȝt with the hert vnto a noble yong lady / that is to wete the fayre vyenne the daulphyns doughter of vyennoys that was his lyege lord / & the more he growed toward his flouryng age ye more he was esprysed & brennyng of her loue for the grrte beaute yt was in hyr / But Parys thought euer in hys herte that this loue was not wel lykly ne cordable / ¶For he was not of so hyghe lygnage as the noble mayden

vyenne was of / & therfore Parys kept hys loue secrete that none shold perceyue it sauf Edward his trusty felowe to whom he brake & shewed his counceyl And the fayre vyenne perceyued not that parys was amerous of hyr / nor parys also durst neyther shewe nor say nothynge to hyr of hyt / but the more that he sawe hyr the more grewe ye fyre of loue within hym self /
