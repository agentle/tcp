            TO MY HONOVRED friend, maſter Thomas May, vpon his Comedy, The Heire.
            
            THe Heire being borne, was in his tender age
            Rockt in the Cradle of a priuate Stage,
            Where lifted vp by many a willing hand,
            The child doth from the firſt day fairely ſtand,
            Since, hauing gathered ſtrength, he dares preferre
            His ſteps into the publicke Theater
            The World: where he diſpaires not but to find
            A doome from men more able, but leſſe kind.
            I but his Vſher am, yet if my word
            May paſſe, I dare be bound he will afford
            Things muſt deſerue a welcome, it well knowne
            Such as beſt writers would haue wiſht their owne.
            You ſhall obſerue his words in order meete,
            And often ſtealing on, with equall feete
            Slide into equall numbers, with ſuch grace
            As each word had beene moulded for that place.
            You ſhall perceiue an amorous paſſion, ſpun
            Into ſo ſmooth a web, as had the ſunne,
            When he purſu'd the ſwiftly flying Maid,
            Courted her in ſuch language ſhe had ſtaid,
            A loue ſo well expreſt muſt be the ſame,
            The Author felt himſelfe from his faire flame.
            The whole plot doth like it ſelfe diſcloſe
            Through the fiue Acts, as doth a Looke, that goes
            With letters, for till euery one be knowne,
            The Lock's as faſt as if you had found none.
            And where his ſportiue Muſe doth draw a thred
            Of mirth, chaſt Matrons may not bluſh to reade.

                  For her old husband, muſt I counterfeit,
                  But in a deeper, a farre deeper ſtraine
                  Weepe like a Father for his onely ſonne,

                  Why there it goes, I thought to haue chid you ſonne Shallow, I knew what you had done, tis too apparant, I would not haue people take notice of it pray God ſhe hide her great belly as ſhe goes to Church to day.

                  Worthy, beſides he is Noble, his fortunes ſufficient,
                  They both loue each other, what can my father
                  More deſire, that he gapes ſo after this old
                  Count▪ that comes for the eſtate, as tother vpon
                  My ſoule does not, but pure ſpotleſſe loue, but
                  Now his plot is for reuenge vpon his old enemy:
                  Fye, Fye tis bloudy and vnchriſtian, my ſoule
                  Abhors ſuch acts, this match may rather
                  Reconcile our houſes, and I deſire where worth
                  Is to haue friendſhip, as on my ſoule tis there.
                  Well Philocles I hope to call thee brother.
                  Somewhat Ile doe, Ile goe perſwade Count

                  Not to loue her, I know the way, and Ile but
                  Tell him truth her brother liues, that will
                  Coole his loue quickly; but ſoft, here comes
                  The Count as fit as may be.
               
               Enter Virro.

                  I ſhall haue her, her father ſayes I ſhall,
                  And I dare take his word, maides are quickly
                  Ouer-rul'd, ah, ah, me thinkes I am growne yonger
                  Then I was by twenty yeeres, this Fortune
                  Caſt vpon me, is better then Medeas charme, to

                  He can wrong no man, no man can complaine,
                  But mercy ſhewed oft takes way reliefe
                  From the wronged partie that the Law would giue him:
