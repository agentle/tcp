In the moneth of Iuny ane preist cumis out of ye Lewis in ane bait to this Ile, and ministeris the sacrament of baptisme to all ye barnis that hes bene borne in the ȝeir afore. Als sone as this preist hes done his office with certane messis, he ressauis the tyndis of all thair cōmoditeis, and returnis hame the same gait he come.

                  CAratak maid ansuer to this message ī maner followyng. Had ȝe Britonis nocht refusit oure supporte frely offerit to ȝow, quhen Iulius the romane counsull inuadit ȝow with iniust battall▪ it suld nocht haue bene necessar to ȝow this day, to seik support at ws, nor ȝit suld it haue ben necessar to ws, to rais our army aganis sa pissant ennymes. For than be iunyng of al our pissance togidder, we mycht esaly haue vincust thaym, and bene delyuerit of all dredoure, reiosing oure rowmis in Albion with perpetuall rest. Ȝit better is (as thay say) lait than neuir thryf. It is nocht now to be deuysit, how we mycht haue dantit the romanis in tyme bigane. Bot how we may eschew the hie dangeir now appering. Ȝe complane that ȝe ar iniustly inuadit be ane ryche pepyl, richt desirus to haue dominion, and to reif othir mennis guddis. Ȝe haue bene subdewit to thaym mony ȝeris, lyffand vnder thair seruytude in ȝour awin defalt. For ȝe ar deuidit amang ȝour self be seditionis intestyne, and sa lang as ȝe stand so, ȝour common weill sall neuer be fre. Forthir ȝour munitionis & strenthis ar stuffit with romane sodiouris, & ȝour planis ar garnist with thair tē

I think thairfore (sen ȝe ar brokyn with sa many calamiteis and battallis) howbeit ye haill power of Albion war concurrant with ȝow. Ȝe can not resist sa pissant ennymes for this tyme, les than ye goddis war contrarius to thaym. Best is for thir causis to meis all seditionis amang ȝoure self, superseding ȝoure weris for ane seasone, and set ȝour laubour with maist crafty ingyne to trāsport this dangerus battall on France. To wirk this prudently ȝe man solist the normandis, picardis, bartaneris, almanis, with all vthir pepyll lyand on the bordour of France, to rebell aganis romanis, in esperance to recouer thair liberte, and promit (gif thay wyll assyst thairto) to support thaym with schippis, weirmen, gold and vthir necessaris pertenand to thair weris. Ȝe man eik be confiderat with all pepyll that hatis the romanis. And gif ȝe do this weill, ȝe sall eschew this battall that the Romanis intendis to moue on ȝow, & conuert it on Frāce. Thus sall baith ȝe and we be delyuerit of all fere of ennymes, & leif the remanent of this ȝeir in quiete, & the mair abyll ye nixt ȝeir for battall. And gif thair be na way to eschew this maist dangerus battall, than think I best to assemble all the pepyll of Albion togidder, to fecht with honest battal to the deith, but ony respect to our lif, bot allanerly to our glore & honour, for na pepil may de mair honestly than fechtand for thair liberte & natiue goddꝭ aganis ye lordꝭ of ye warld.

At last quhen he had gottin gret proffet be slauchter & proscription of his noblis, he began to put his handis mair pertly in thair blud. For he thocht the proffet sa sweit yt come to hym be slaucht of his noblis, that he mycht not desist thairfra. For he had doubil proffet be yat way. First thay war slane yt he dred. And secoundly he gat thair guddis to sustene ane gard of armit mē to defend hym fra iniure of yam yt he suspeckit. Forthir yt he micht inuade ye pepyl with mair tyrāny, he biggit ane strang castel in ye hicht of Dunsynnane, ane hyll in Gowry x. milis fra Perth. Yis castel was biggit wt infinit expensis. For for na stuf micht be carijt to ye samyn but gret difficulte. And ȝit he ceissit not fra ye bigging yairof, bot causit al the Thanis of ylk schire to big ye said castel yair cours about. At last it fel to Makduf thane of Fif to big his ꝑt of ye said castel, And becaus he durst not cā to yis werk, in auenture ye king put handis in hym as he did afore in othir noblis of ye realme, he send craftismen with al prouision, & cōmādit yame to do sa ī his absence, yt ye king micht haue na occasion to be mouit aganis hym.

Nocht lang efter kyng Robert fel in gret infirmite, and gaif ouir the gouernance of the realme to erle Thomas Randall and schir Iames Douglas. For thay war .ii. of ye maist nobill knychtis in the warld. Thir two chiftanis enterit in Northumberland with .xxv.M. men. Aganis quhome come kyng Edward with .i.C.M. men. Nochtheles thir two campionis gouernit thair army with sic manheid and wisdome that thay waistit all ye cuntre quhare yai come, and returnit but ony dāmage in scotland. Kyng Edward to resist thir incursionis, come with ane .C.M. men in scotland, and wrocht gret cruelteis quhare thay come. To yat fyne, that the scottis suld come in defence of thair landis and guddis. At last quhen thay had lyue thre dayis at ye watter of Tyne and mycht not cum ouir. For it wes rysin aboue the brayis. Tythingis come yat al Northumberlād wes brint and heryit be scottis, and ye forray passand sa fast throw the cuntre but ony residence, yt na man wist quhare to find yame. In the mene tyme wer send out exploratouris on swift hors to se quhair the scottis wer, and fand thaym within thre mylis to ye tentis of Inglismen arrayit on ane hill reddy to fecht.

                   baith ye armyis wer arrayit in vtheris sycht. The scottis beand of small noumer in regard of Inglismen, stude arrayit at ane gret strenth on the hill. At last quhen Inglismen had stand all day and durst nocht brek thair array, thay returnit to thair palȝonis. And send ane herald to scottis desiring yame (gif yat durst fecht) to cum to the planis, quhare thay mycht haue battal. As it had bene na prudence to capitanis to garnis thair army with maist ordour and munition that mycht be deuisit. And quhen ye armyis had stād thre nychtis in athir sycht, and durst nocht inuaid othir, thay returnit to thair tentis. Eftir ye baith ye armyis had standin lang tyme arrayit in othir sycht on this maner, Schir Iames of Douglas tuke purpos to assailȝe ane mater of gret vassalage. And incontinent he chesit .ii.C. rycht vailȝeant and deliuer men with swift geldingis, and slippit quietly by the wache of Inglismen, quhilkꝭ wer at that tyme all on sleip except ane certane, quhilkis wer awalkenit be dyn of hors feit. Thus come the Douglas but ony noyis to king Edwardis palȝoun. And wer nocht the army of Ingland rais the more hastelie on hym, he had slane the kyng, for he cuttit .ii. towis of his tent & returnit to the army of scottis but ony dāmage to hym or his folkis. Ye Inglismen eftir this effray wer the more vigilant in times cuming. For thay had bene alluterlie discomfist, gif the army of scottis had inuadit thaym the said nycht. The Scottis traisting yis vassalage sufficient for this tyme, returnit hame but ony displeseir. Als sone as Inglismen wer aduertist that the scottis wer departit, thay come haistely to ye place quhare thair tentis lay in esperance of sum ryche spulȝe, and fād .x.M. pair of hieland schone skatterit throw all boundis quhair ye army of scotland

The Inglismen held the papis ambassatouris in sic contemption that thay wald nocht suffer thaym to cum in thair presence. Throw quhilk thay wer constranit to depart but ony expeditioun of thair materis. Sone efter ane conuentioun was maid be Edward Ballioll at Perth, quhare the nobyllis of Scotland ratifyit hym king, and promyttit be thair aithis neuir to rebell aganis hym in tymes cumyng. In the mene tyme rais ane scharp contentioun betuix Hary Bewmont & Alexander Mowbray for certane landꝭ ī Buchquhā. Hary Bewmont clamit thir landis to pertene to him. For he maryit the said Alexanderis douchter quhylk was heritoure (as he allegit) to the said landis. On ye tothir side Alexander Mowbray clamit thir landis be reasoun of succession, as aire to his brothir. Efter lang contentioun the said Alexander Mowbray gat the landis adiugit to hym be sentence of the Ballioll. Dauid Cumyn e

And stuffit the castell of Dongard in Buchquhane with mony othir housis of Scotland aganis his auctorite. The Ballioll seyng gret trubyll apperyng to hym be this way, retretit the sentence that he gaif for Alexander Mowbray, and be new sentence adiugit the landis to pertene to the said Hary Bewmont, becaus he maryit the herytoure thairof. The parteis that clamit thir landis war sa gret, that the iust verite of thair debait couth neuir be decidit be sicht of Iustice. Thus was ye Ballioll constranit to haue ay the ta

Than was brocht to hym the keyis of the castellis of Rothesay and Dunnone be schir Allane Lyle Sereif of Bute. Yus grew the Balliol dayly in mair pissance be cōfluence of pepil. For he enrichit thaym with landis and gudis that assistit to him. Robert Stewart heirand the Balliol set ylk day for his slauchter, come out of Bute to the castell of Dunbritane▪ quhare he was plesandly ressauit be Malcolme Flemyng keipar thairof. In the mene tyme the Ballyoll rasit ane army to take all the strenthis of Scotland, becaus thay war occasioun of battall aganis hym. ¶In the nixt ȝeir he laid ane sege to the castell of Lochleuyn. And quhen he had considerit that this castell mycht nocht be tane but lang sege, he left schir Iohne Stryuelyng to ly at the sege thairof with ane gret power, quhyll the castell war won. ¶And to do thair besines mair esaly, thay maid thair bastailȝeis and trinscheis of Fale and Deuat in the kirkȝard of sanct Sarfe besyde Kinrosse. This castell was kepit be Alane Uepount and Iames Lamby cietezanis of sanct Andros. ¶At last quhen thir Inglismen had assailȝeit lang tyme to get this castell. Efter mony gret assaltis with syndry ingynis, howbeit thay war in vane, thay deuysit be ane subtell slycht to take the castell but ony straik. ¶First thay inclusit the watter that ran out of the Loch with ane hye dyke, and biggir it sa strait with fale Deuat and treis, that the wat

And to caus the dam to boldyn mair haistely, thay brocht burnis fra syndry partis to the said loch. Schir Iohne Stryuelyng capitane of the sege, seand al thingis (as he beleuit) done in dew maner (for na thyng mycht auale bot proces of tyme to wyn the hous) went to Dunfermelyng to his deuotion (becaus it was sanct Margretis day ye haly quene of scotland) & left behynd hym sa mony as he thocht sufficient to kepe the sege. Alane Uepount capitane foresaid knawyng ye gret dangeir apperyng to hym, send .iiii. men out of the castel within ye nicht in ane bait with speris & wappynnis to breke ye dyke foresaid. And quhen thay had laubourit all nycht borand the dike fore said, thay tuke purpos (becaus yai

Nochtheles ane of thaym exhortit ye laif to continew furth ane houre to se quhat fyne mycht cum of thair lauboure. Als sone as thay persauit ane hole maid throw the dyke, thay returnit to the castell. Incontinent the streme followit sa fast quhare the watter gat passage▪ that it brake down the bastailȝeis, and nocht onely drownit the pepyll that lay vnder ye dam, bot brocht thaym with hors cariage & al yair prouision to ye see. Alane Uepount (quhen the watter was fallin to ye auld mesoure) yschit out of the castell, & slew ane part of thaym that war eschapit at this tyme, and the remanent put to flycht. ☞¶Iohne Striuelyng herand sic calamyte fallyng to his folkis returnit to the sege, and maid ane vow neuir to depart thairfra quhyll it war taikyn, And euery person

For he was ane man of nobyll blude of gret manrent and landis, & gart hym sweir to be as trew to kyng Dauid, as he was afore to kyng Edward.

               ¶Of the slauchter of kyng Iames the first, and of the punition yat vvas maid yairfore, and of syndry meruellis sene in Albion, Ca. viii.
               
                  GRet myscheif and sorow followit in scotland efter this discomfitour of Inglismen at Piperden be hid wachsing of Walter Stewart erle of Athole, quhilk pretendit ay ane richt to the crown, be reason yat he was gottyn be king Robert ye secund on his first wyfe. This erle (as we schew afore in ye genology of stewardis) was the principal mouar of Robert duk of Albany to sla Dauid Steward duk of Rothesay. And efter the hame cumyng of Iames the first, he solistit the said kyng to slay duk Mordo with all othir duk Robertis lynnage. Traisting quhē thir nobyll men war put down to fynd sum hyd way to slay the kyng and his barnis, that he mycht thairefter succede to the crown. And becaus all duke Robertis sonnis war deceissit, sum of thaym slane at the battal of Uernoll and otheris Iustifyit be kyng Iames, he perswadit Robert Stewart his nepot and Robert grahame his cousyn to slay the kyng. This Robert was afore at the kyngis horne, for syndry gret offensis done be hym aganis the kingis auctorite, and had na thing in mair hatrent than the kyng. Thir vnhappy tratouris lyand (as said is) in wait to espy ganand tyme to fulfyll thair cursit purpos, come sone efter to ye blak freris of Perth, quhare ye kyng was lugit for ye tyme. And be licence of the portaris thay enterit in ye kingis hall.
