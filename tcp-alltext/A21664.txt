            TO HIS RENOWMED excellency, Henry Prince of Wales, Sonne and Heire apparant to our moſt gracious Soueraigne, increaſe of all Royall giftes and graces.
            
               IF my meanes come in queſtion, with the greatnes of your Perſon, (O moſt Noble young Prince) it may be denied intollerable boldnes, for me to preſent unto your highnes ſo ſimple a Booke in ſo plaine a verſe but, if the matter and manner be equally ballanced: The former, intreating of three moſt excellent fundamentall points of ſacred profeſſion, Viz:) firſt the creation, 2. the Subverſion & reſtoration of mankind. I hope no Chriſtian will take exception, but the patronage thereof, may wel become your perſon.
            As for the maner, compoſed in verſe, If that ſeeme too baſe for ſo graue points of ſkill (which ought rather to be handled in proſe,) I ſay with all humilitie, that GOD is Authour of both aſwell verſe as proſe) and that in the chiefeſt ſecrets of Diuinty, for (next the holy Trinity) what pointes can be named of greater importance, then mercy and Iudgement:) And yet the moſt princely Prophet Dauid ſaide: His Song ſhould be of mercy

and Iudgement) If his example will not ſtande my warrant: yet, all his Pſalmes with Athanaſius Creed of the higheſt Miſteries publiſhed in verſe, (with our Soueraigns priuiledge) will approue the maner (againſt all detractors. But ſome may yet replye; The ſtile of my verſe is to lowe and ſimple to preaſſe into a Princes preſence, vnleſſe it were of an higher pitch, &c. I confeſſe no leſſe, and yet auouch thus much, that the ſimpler my skill is, the more it ſhall commend your Chriſtian diſpoſition (moſt Noble Prince) to accept of the ſame. In aſſurance whereof, I haue thus far preſumed to publiſh theſe verſes ſo familiarly (after Dauids pſalmes) for the more eaſie apprehention & remembrance of the meaner ſort of people, to vſe at al times for their edification, that God may be gloryfied in their ſaluation, which is the end of my poore indeuors, committing the ſucceſſe vnto his good bleſſing, with your moſt Noble perſon, long to prolong many good yeares in health, with much increaſe of honor: Amen.

               1.
               I Do not ſeeke to feede their fickle braine,
               In filed phraze, that ſet there ſole delight,
               Nor how to deſcant braue on things moſt vaine,
               Mens minds to leudneſſe thereby to excite.
               
                  Becauſe the time ſo ſpent, as loſt (or worſe)
               
               
                  And brings repentance, (if no greater curſe.)
               
            
            
               2.
               But: He that would be glad to heare and know,
               The three eſtates of mankind in this life,
               VVhat loue to his, the Lord doth alwaies ſhow,
               And how the Deuill doth ſow debate and ſtrife.
               
                  The former ſtill dehorting all from ſin,

               Both means to vſe, To make the ſame more plain.

               Which, (for our learning) ſafe recorded are.

                  THE FIRST POINT. In Creating all thinges for our vſe, and vs for his glory.
               
                  1
                  O Glorious God, how much is Man,
                  For euer bound to praiſe thy Name,Geneſis Chap. 1.
                  
                  No mortall wight can rightly ſcan,
                  As all thy workes expreſſe the ſame.
               
               
                  2.
                  If man looke vp with fixed eyes,
                  How wonderfully doth appeare,
                  Thy workmanſhip in azure skyes,
                  Withall thy creatures planted there.Gene. 1.
                  
               
               
                  3.
                  The Sunne and Moone aboue the reſt,
                  To guide and rule each day and night,
                  With liſtering Starres all ready preſt,
                  To pleaſure vs by ſhining bright.
               
               
                  4.
                  The Clouds that hang aboue our heads,
                  (As times and ſeaſons do require)
                  Their fruitfull ſhewers abroad do ſpread,Gene. 1.
                  
                  To ſatisfie our hartes deſire.
               
               
                  
                  5.
                  If Man caſt downe his eyes below,
                  
                     Gen. 1.To view Gods Creatures heare on earth,
                  How do they all his loue foreſhew,
                  Still to preſerue Mans vitall breath.
               
               
                  6.
                  The Foules that flye in firmament,
                  And all kind Fiſhes in the Sea,
                  
                     Gen. 1.To take and vſe, for his content,
                  With Beaſtes on th'earth to rule alway.
               
               
                  7.
                  And, for mans meat, God did prouide,
                  All fruitefull trees (ſaue onely one)
                  
                     Gen. 1.VVith euery Hearb that beareth ſeed,
                  For man all times to feede vpon.
               
               
                  8.
                  A pleaſant place cald Parradice,
                  God planted mankind firſt therein,
                  
                     Gen. 2.To haue all times what hart could wiſh,
                  So long as he auoyded ſinne.
               
               
                  9.
                  And that man might liue in this ſtate,
                  And neuer dye (vnleſſe he would)
                  
                     Gen. 2.The tree of life, thereon to eate,
                  God planted in that ſacred mould.
               
               
                  10.
                  How truely then, might mankind ſay,
                  
                     Pſal. 8.How much are we (Lord) bound to thee,
                  For all thy fauours euery way,
                  Inlarged ſo aboundantly.
               
               
                  
                  11.
                  Much more. If thou lift vp thy mind,Gods loue to man.
                  
                  To meditate Gods loue to thee,
                  A thouſand fould thou ſhalt it finde,
                  Exceeding others in degree.
               
               
                  12.
                  For, In creating all things elſe,Gen. 1.
                  
                  God onely ſaid, (Let it be ſo?)
                  
                  And ſo they were, (as Scripture tels)
                  His mighty power, (by word to ſhoe.)
               
               
                  13.
                  But, In creating Man, God ſaid,Gen. 1, 26
                  
                  
                     Let vs make Man: where by we ſee,
                  His perfect perſon to be made,
                  Euen by the bleſſed Trinity.
               
               
                  14.
                  Which proueth, man did farre excell,
                  All former workes, it is moſt plaine:Gen. 1, 26 27.
                  
                  As that which followes (marke it well)
                  
                     In our owne Image doth containe.
               
               
                  15.
                  For (by Gods Image) in this place,Gen. 2.20 Col. 3.10.
                  
                  Is meant theſe ſpeciall qualities,
                  (His Knowledge, Truth, and Holineſſe)
                  All which in Man, were pure likewiſe.
               
               
                  16.
                  For Knowledge, Adam firſt did name,Eph. 4.24.
                  
                  (All liuing Creatures in their kind)
                  His Life alſo, was without blame,
                  
                  And all the graces of his minde.
                  
               
               
                  
                  17.
                  So that in theſe was no diſſent,
                  
                     Gen. 3Twixt God and Man, (for gifts moſt cleare)
                  
                     Saue (all in God, were permanent)
                  But man might change, (as did appeare)
               
               
                  18.
                  Behold Gods loue to man, yet more,
                  
                     Mans prerog. Gene. 1.
                     In placing him the ſupreame Lord,
                  Of all his Creatures made before,
                  To guide and gouerne by his word.
               
               
                  19.
                  And that, which moſt did ſhew Gods loue,
                  There was but one excepted Tree,
                  Which he forbad that man ſhould proue,
                  
                     Gen. 2.On paine of death eternally.
               
               
                  20.

                  And ſo the Serpent, he allures.

                  Directing him, firſt to beginne,

                  The Serpent then, (vpon her ſpeech)

                  Did ſeeke thereby to ouerreachGene. 3.

                  And thereupon, He anſwered,

                  The woman heareunto replyes,

                  To doubt of that, (which God ſaid plaine)
                  At what time thereon ye ſhall eate,

                  8.
                  The Serpent ſeeing her made doubt,
                  
                     Geneſis 3To eate thereof for feare of death,

                  9.
                  For, Well God knowes, the very day,
                  
                     Geneſis 3That you ſhall eate thereon your fill,
                  You ſhall be like to him alway,
                  In knowledge of both good and euill.

                  The woman then diſtruſting God,
                  And truſting Serpents ſubtiltyes,

                  Whereby, they loſe that Image pure,

                  Once, were our ſoules the Image pure
                  Of Gods eternall maieſty,Gen. 1 & 2.
                  
                  Now, are they filthy and obſcure,
                  Like Sathan, in all villanie.

                  Once, was our wit and will moſt cleare,
                  To know, and do the will of God,
                  Now, are they voyde of all ſuch care,
                  And after ſin, do range abroad.

                  Once, were our members ready preſt.
                  All times to pleaſe the liuing Lord,
                  Now are they all, with ſinne poſſeſt,
                  And follow it with one accord.

                  8.
                  Once, were our ſoules and bodies both,
                  Planted in pleaſant Parradiſe,
                  Now baniſh thence, (though moſt vnloath,)

                  9.
                  Once, had we health, and harts deſire,
                  Exempted from all kinds of woe,Leuit. 26
                  
                  Now are we forſt, (as wood in fire)Deu. 28.

                  10.
                  Once, were we all Gods Seruants free,
                  To liue with him in bleſſedneſſe,Of our ſelues.
                  
                  Now, are we bound, (by death) to lye,
                  
                     In helliſh paine, without releaſe.

                  And Woman next (in hope of gaines)

                     Yet Adams fact was worthy blame,

                  Abuſd the Serpents tongue to lye,

                     All were accurſed for that ſinne.

                  Obedience due in perfect wiſe.
               
               
                  8.
                  Now, ſeeing Adam and his ſeede,
                  Haue broke the bonds that once God made,
                  Shall not he iuſtifie his deede,
                  To ſee the forfaytures be paid.
               
               
                  9.
                  Then will they laſt of all demaund,
                  (If Gods Law do not iuſtifie)
                  Why did he Moſes then commaund,Obiection
                  
                  (To write it for poſterity.)
               
               
                  10.
                  I anſwer, with the Apoſtle Paule,Anſwere.
                  
                  If Gods Law any man could ſaue,Gal. 2.
                  
                  Then Chriſt his death was vaine (for all,)
                  For Sauiours two, we neede not haue.
               
               
                  
                  11.
                  And yet no want in Gods law found.
                  
                     No default in the law.For why? It is his holy will)
                  But ſinne, mans nature hath ſo bound,
                  That we cannot the ſame fulfill.
               
               
                  12.
                  So that; none can Gods Law accuſe,
                  To be vniuſt, or ſent in vaine,
                  
                     Seuerall vſes in the law.For why? It ſerueth to good vſe,

                  The firſt: It lets vs ſee the ſtate

                  That we to Chriſt, for helpe might flee,
                  To ſaue our ſoules from endleſſe thrall.

                  And Gods iuſt iudgement for the ſame,
                  That we might all auoyd thoſe grins,
                  And ſo to keepe our ſoules from ſhame.

                        Vſe 4The fourth: It lets vs ſee the way,
                  How we ſhould walke to pleaſe the Lord,
                  That for his grace, we ſtill might pray:
                  To line according to his word.
               
            
            
               
               
                  How Gods Iuſtice and mercy ioyne both together in mankinds reſtoration.
               
                  1.
                  ALmighty God, beholding Man,
                  (Depryued of his bleſſedneſſe,)
                  To look with viſage pale and wan,
                  (By reaſon of his wretchedneſſe.)
               
               
                  2.
                  And knowing him in leaſt default,
                  No Tempter (as the others were)
                  But ſore abuſd (by their aſſault)
                  And vtter ſpoyld (as did appeare.)
               
               
                  3.
                  Then, In his great compaſſion,
                  Of mankinds extreame miſery,
                  God entred conſultation,
                  Their rewfull ſtate to remedy,
               
               
                  4.
                  That, Where their ſins deſerued death,
                  (Euen by iuſt doome for euermore)
                  Mercy alone, (as Scripture ſaith)
                  Could not mans happy ſtate reſtore,
               
               
                  5.
                  Vnleſſe Gods Iuſtice therewithall,
                  (By ſuffering death, were ſatisfied,)
                  Then God to counſell did both call,
                  And (by conſent) hath thus decreed.
               
               
                  
                  6.
                  That: Where Mans nature did offend,
                  And ſo deſerued for to dye,
                  Mans nature, ſhould that fault amend
                  And ſuffer death accordingly.
               
               
                  7.
                  
                     Hebr. 9.Yet ſo: (as he ſhould ouercome)
                  Both Death and Sathan, Prince of Hell,
                  And ſo reſtore mankinds freedome,
                  In euerlaſting ioyes to dwell.
               
               
                  8.
                  And, for that Angels were to weake,
                  (To conquer theſe great enimies,)
                  The Sonne of God did vndertake,
                  This high moſt worthy enterprize.
               
               
                  9.
                  Whereto, his Father gaue conſent,
                  He ſhould deſcend from Heauen ſo high,
                  On earth for to be reſident,
                  Till he had got the victory.
               
               
                  10.
                  And to that end, it was his will,
                  Of bleſſed Virgin to be borne,
                  The holy Scripture to fulfill,
                  And vs to helpe that were forlorne.
               
               
                  11.
                  By his two natures vnited,
                  
                     Col. 2.(Both God and Man, one perſon pure)
                  He might be alwaies furniſhed,
                  Our former freedome to procure.
               
               
                  
                  12.
                  In Mans Nature (as capable,
                  To vndergo all kind of paine)
                  In Gods Nature, (as alwaies able)
                  To help himſelf and vs againe.
               
               
                  13.
                  Firſt, with our nature to begin,
                  (Where that was ſtayned in Gods ſight,)Chriſtes pure conception.
                  
                  Chriſt tooke our Nature (without ſinne)
                  Conceyued, (through Holy-ghoſt his might)
               
               
                  14.
                  And of the Virgin Mary borne,Lu. 1. & 2 A ſauior.
                     
                  
                  (As Th'angel did fore-propheſie)
                  Elſe had all mankind beene forlorne,
                  Without all hope of remedy.
               
               
                  15.
                  And that all people then might know,
                  He was of power to ſaue vs all,Mat. 1.21. Luk. 1, 30 36.
                  
                  His very name, the ſame did ſhow,
                  As Th'angell (Ieſus) did him call.
               
               
                  16.
                  Likewiſe, (becauſe he vndertooke,Heb.9.14. 1 Iohn 2.22.
                  
                  To be our Prophet, King, and Prieſt,)
                  It is recorded in Gods Booke,
                  That he was alſo called Chriſt.
               
               
                  17.
                  Which is, (Annoynted of the Lord,)
                        Anoynted. Pſal.45.7 Hebr. 1.9.
                  
                  To execute thoſe offices,
                  That (by his ſauing worke and word)
                  He might our freedome accompliſh.
               
               
                  
                  18.
                  Thus, Ieſus Chriſt, (He being borne)
                  And growing vp to Mans degree,
                  Doth thinke on vs, that were forlorne,
                  In former ſtate to ſet vs free.
               
               
                  19.
                  For, Well he knew, our ſinfull fall,
                  Did ſpoyle vs all of bleſſedneſſe,
                  
                     Eph. 2. Col. 3.And brought vs likewiſe to be thrall,
                  To euerlaſting curſedneſſe.
               
               
                  20.
                  Becauſe we neither could fulfill,
                  The law of God, that leads to bliſſe,
                  Nor beare his wrathfull vengeance ſtill,
                  Till we had quited his iuſtice.
               
               
                  21.
                  Without both which, Chriſt knew right well,
                  That we were left remedileſſe,
                  From euer ſcaping out of Hell,
                  Or getting former happineſſe.
               
               
                  22.
                  Both which Chriſt did, in our Nature,
                  Well vndertake for to ſupply,
                  And ſo from time to time made ſure,
                  His Fathers wrath to pacifie.
               
               
                  23.
                  For, whereas without righteouſneſſe,
                  We could not come to bleſſed reſt,
                  Chriſt liu'd in vpright holineſſe,
                  (As in the Scripture is expreſt.)
               
               
                  
                  24.
                  Not onely in auoyding,
                  But euer doing good withall,
                  His Fathers will for to fulfill,
                  For vs (through ſinne) ſtill kept in thrall.
               
               
                  25.
                  That ſo our nature full of ſinne,
                  Before Gods throne of grace in Chriſt,
                  Might be preſented pure in him,
                  In whom our comfort doth conſiſt▪
                  
               
            
            
               
                  What Chriſt ſuffered in his body, for the ſinnes of our bodies.
               
                  1
                  
                     IMmanuell Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                  Hauing fulfild his Fathers Law,
                  Did likewiſe willingly accord,
                  The penalty to vndergo.
               
               
                  2.
                  That where we all deſerued ſhame,
                  In body and Soule eternally,
                  He would needes ſuffer for the ſame,
                  In both reſpects to ſet vs free,
               
               
                  3.
                  His bleſſed body did beginne,
                  To ſuffer griefe in euery part,
                  Sore whipt and ſcourged for our ſinne.
                  Which needs muſt vex his inward hart.
               
               
                  
                  4.
                  
                     His head was crowned with ſharp Thornes,
                  
                     His eyes and eares, indured paine,
                  
                     His tongue with taunts the bad did ſcorne,
                  Who ſtill accurſed do remaine.
               
               
                  5.
                  His Armes, his Legges, his hands, his feete,
                  
                  Was nay led faſt vpon the Tree,
                  As ſacrifice for ſinne moſt meete,
                  For our offences ſo to be.
               
               
                  6.
                  His harmeleſſe ſide with pearcing ſpeare,
                  Was wounded deepely for our ſake,
                  From whence blood ran and water cleare,
                  Our full attonement for to make.
               
               
                  7.
                  And laſt of all, his guiltles death,
                  
                  Vpon the croſſe, and put in graue,
                  Shall ſanctifie our mortall breath,
                  Eternall reſt with Chriſt to haue.
               
               
                  8.
                  
                     O bleſſed Ieſus, King of Kings,
                  
                  How much is mankind bound to thee,
                  We muſt confeſſe in all theſe things,
                  And euer prayſe thy maieſty.
               
            
            
               That Chriſt ſuffered in his Soule, for the ſinnes of our Soules.
               
               
                  
                  IF Saloman the wiſeſt King,
                  That euer raigned on this earth,
                  Could not deſcribe the fearefull ſting,
                  Of wounded conſcience during breath.Pro. 18.14
                  
                  
                     No mortall wight can then expreſſe,
                     The foote
                  
                  
                     Of Chriſt his ſoule the penſiueneſſe.
                  
               
               
                  2.
                  Some ſinne we ſee doth preſſe mans hart,
                  So very ſore each day by day,
                  As cauſeth comfort to depart,
                  And ſorrow vexe them euery way.
                  
                     No mortall wight, &c.
                  
               
               
                  3.
                  If wounded conſcience for one ſinne,
                  Do bring ſome men to wofull thrall,As Iudas.
                  
                  What extreame torments was Chriſt in,
                  Who bore that burden for vs all.
                  
                     No mortall wight, &c.
                  
               
               
                  4.
                  We all confeſſe, (in whom is grace)
                  Our ſinfull ſoules, (by Gods iuſt doome)
                  Deſerue with Deuils to haue a place,
                  In euerlaſting woes to come.Ephe. 3
                  
                  
                     No mortall wight can then expreſſe,
                  
                  
                     Of Chriſt his ſoule the penſiueneſſe.
                  
               
               
                  
                  5.
                  Sith then, our Soules do farre exceed,
                  The bodies conſtitution,
                  There ſinne, the greater paine muſt breed,
                  In horrible confuſion.
                  
                     No mortall wight, &c.
                  
               
               
                  6.
                  Gods Iuſtice then muſt needs impoſe,
                  Moſt extreame paine, on Chriſt his Sonne,
                  Sith, he would anſwer for all thoſe,
                  That reſt on his compaſſion.
                  
                     No mortall wight, &c.
                  
               
               
                  7.
                  How great thoſe torments in Chriſtes ſoule,
                  Were felt of him, doth well appeare,
                  
                     Mat. 26 & 27.In that his ſpirit they did controule,
                  To vtter words, (as ſeem'd of feare.)
                  
                     No mortall wight, &c.
                  
               
               
                  8.
                  What was the cauſe that made Chriſt ſay,
                  (My ſoule is heauy vnto Death,)
                  
                     Luke. 22. verſe 44.And for to ſweat (as he did pray)
                  That drops like bloud fell downe to th'earth▪
                  
                  
                     No mortall wight, &c.
                  
               
               
                  9.
                  Yea, when his Father would not heare,
                  What made him then ſo loud to cry,
                  
                     Mat. 27(My God, my God, O Father deere)
                  Why haſt thou thus forſaken me.
                  
                     No mortall wight, &c.
                  
               
               
                  
                  10.
                  It was not paine of body then,
                  That made Chriſt Ieſus thus complaine,
                  But wrath of God, for ſinnes of men,
                  Which he in ſoule did then ſuſtaine.
                  
                     No mortall wight, &c.
                  
               
               
                  12
                  Oh? Who will take delight to ſinne,
                  In ſoule or body night or day,
                  Sith our ſins pad, on Chriſt did bring,
                  So extreame torments euery way:
                  
                     No mortall wight, that can expreſſe,
                  
                  
                     Of Chriſt his ſoule the penſiueneſſe.
                  
               
            
            
               Vpon the ſufferings of our Sauiour Ieſus, two queſtions diſcuſſed.
               
               
                  1
                  THe former, Sith we all confeſſe,
                  Our ſelues ſtill ſinners for to be,
                  And that (as Scripture doth expreſſe)
                  We ought to die eternally.
               
               
                  2.
                  How comes it then to paſſe? declare,The firſt queſtion:
                  
                  That Chriſt (for vs) got victory,
                  
                  And death with Diuels, all conquered are,
                  So, as we ſcape their Tyrany.
               
               
                  3.
                  The anſwer hereunto is plaine,
                  (If we eonſider Death and Deuill,
                  On whom, their power did remaine:
                  Thoſe that delight in ſinne and euill.
               
               
                  
                  4.
                  For onely ſuch, God gaue them leaue,
                  To cut off, when their ſins were ripe,
                  And them (as Iaylors to receyue,)
                  Of ioy and comfort, quite to ſtripe.
               
               
                  5.
                  And in the roome thereof, for aye,
                  (As their moſt iuſt deſerued hyre,)
                  To vexe their ſoules both night and day,
                  In euerlaſting helliſh fire.
               
               
                  6.
                  Now, whereas further they made bold,
                  To lay hands on the Innocent,
                  So were they both to be contrould,
                  (By Gods Iuſtice omnipotent.)
               
               
                  7.
                  But, (by your leaue) will ſome reply,
                  Did not Chriſt come, to ſaue vs all,
                  
                     Reply.And ſo to ſuffer willingly,
                  To ranſome vs, from endleſſe thrall.
               
               
                  8.
                  It is moſt true (we all confeſſe)
                  In which reſpect, it may be ſaide,
                  
                     Repulſed.If Death, and Sathans craftineſſe,
                  Their heads together then had layd.
               
               
                  9.
                  To puniſh Chriſt (as one that would,
                  Needes vndertake for others ſins,)
                  They could not then, haue beene contrould,
                  For holding him, within their grins.
               
               
                  
                  10.
                  But, ſith they durſt put him to death,
                  (As guilty in his owne perſon)As a Blaſphemer. Naturally
                  
                  For telling truth (as Scripture ſaith)
                  He was of God (the onely Sonne)
               
               
                  11.
                  Heerein (preſuming without cauſe,
                  (To puniſh Chriſt moſt Innocent,)
                  
                  He rid himſelfe out of their clawes,
                  (Through power Diuine) incontinent.
               
               
                  12.
                  And roſe againe out of the graue,
                  (As iuſt tryumphing Conqueror)
                  Our ſoules and bodies for to ſaue,
                  From Sathans power for euermore.
               
               
                  13.
                  For right and Iuſtice did agree,

                  14.
                  Then muſt it ſtand with Gods iuſt doome,
                  (Sith Death and Sathan did conſpyre)
                  To do Iniuſtice to his ſonne,
                  Of Heauen and Earth the onely heyre.)

                  That they ſhould forfeit all their right,
                  (Which they on Sinners had before)
                  To Ieſus Chriſt, the Lord of might,
                  (Euen whom he pleaſe, for to reſtore.)
               
               
                  
                  16.
                  By Iuſtice therefore, now we ſee,

                  18.
                  The ſecond queſtion, ſtandeth thus,

                  How comes it then, that Chriſt Ieſus,

                  19.
                  And ſuffer but ſo ſmall a ſpace,
                  His Fathers wrath to pacifie,
                  And vs againe reſtore to grace,
                  Gods iuſtice ſatisfied thereby.
               
               
                  20.
                  The anſwer ſtandeth on two parts,
                  (And both of them performd in Chriſt)
                  To cheare and comfort all our harts,
                  And pleaſe our God in heauen the hyeſt.
               
               
                  21.
                  The former is, (if we reſpect,)
                  
                     Col. 2
                     Chriſts Godhead, ioynd with our nature,
                  
                  Then will it preſently detect,
                  That plaine, (which ſeeme before obſcure.)
               
               
                  
                  22.
                  For Chriſt (By his Diuinity,)
                  Could ſuffer more within one houre,
                  
                     (Aſsiſting his humanity)
                  Then we ſhould ſuffer euermore.
               
               
                  23.
                  The latter maketh it more plaine,Hoſ. 13, 14. 1 Cor. 15 Hebr. 2.
                  
                  When Chriſt (by death) had vanquiſht death,
                  What force in him could then remaine,
                  To hold vs ſubiect to his wrath.
               
               
                  24.
                  Methinkes I heare yet, ſome reply,
                  If Death haue loſt his force indeede,
                  How comes it then, that all men dye,A Reply Repulſed.
                  
                  (According to our common Creede.)
               
               
                  25.
                  I do reioynd, and ſtill auow,
                  Death hath no power to hurt at all,
                  (But where our Chriſt doth him allow,)
                  All ſuch, as to his wrath are thrall.

                  As for Chriſts choſen Seruants deere,
                  Death is their friend (againſt his will,)
                  By ridding them of ſorrowes heere,
                  To liue in ioy and pleaſure ſtill.

                  Thus do we more and more behold,
                  The loue of Chriſt our Sauiour,
                  To Adams heyres, on earthly mould,
                  That we might praiſe him euermore.

                  Which makes them weepe both day and night,

                  The wrath of God (on Croſſe) he bore,Col. 2

                  Striue then to ſhew the true effect,
                  
                     Lu. 13, 24 Iam. 2And fruits of liuely faith,
                  Elſe Chriſt (as dead) wil thee reiect.
                  (As holy Scripture ſaith.)
               
               
                  5.
                  For why? The gate is very ſtraite,
                  That leadeth vnto bliſſe,
                  
                     Mat. 7, 13 14.And few do enter in thereat,
                  So hard to find it is.
               
               
                  6.
                  Doſt thou beleeue within thine hart,
                  Chriſt dyed for thy ſin?
                  Then from the ſame thou muſt depart,
                  
                     2 Tim, 2, 19.And come no more therein.
               
               
                  7.
                  Doſt thou beleeue Chriſt roſe againe,
                  
                     Col. 3 Rom. 6.Thy freedome to reſtore?
                  Then muſt thou holineſſe retaine,
                  To pleaſe him euermore.

                  The ioyes of Heauen they do belong,
                  (To onely ſuch indeede,)
                  Who do refraine from doing wrong,
                  And follow right with ſpeede.
               
               
                  9.
                  But if thou doſt delight in ſinne,
                  And after it ſtill range,
                  So that thou wilt not once beginne,
                  Thy wicked waies to change.
               
               
                  
                  10.
                  It is moſt true, (as thou ſhalt find)Iam. 2.
                  
                  Thy faith is dead and vaine,
                  And fearefull woes ſhall vex thy mind,
                  In euerlaſting paine.
               
               
                  11.
                  Oh then, whilſt God doth grant thee ſpace,
                  Cry hard both day and night,
                  That he will giue to thee his grace,
                  To lead thy life vpright.
               
               
                  12.
                  Then ſhall thy workes, thy faith approue,
                  To be aliue and ſound,Iam. 2. Reu. 2, 10
                  
                  Then art thou deere to God aboue,
                  And ſhalt (in Chriſt) be crownd.

                     Let Saints and Angels firſt begin,
                  
                  
                     To laud thy name alwaies.
                  
               
            
            
               Infallible tokens of predeſtation vnto Saluation.

                  HE that doth looke to raigne with Chriſt,
                  In euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe,
                  Muſt take great care that he perſiſt,
                  In theſe degrees of holineſſe.
               
               
                  2.
                  The firſt, He muſt lament his ſin,
                  Whereby he hath offended God,
                  And ſeeke to come no more therein,
                  Leaſt he correct him with his rod,
                  
                     3. The ſecond, He muſt loue Gods houſe,
                  To learne his dutie willingly,
                  And thither often take his courſe,
                  To worſhip God vnfainedly.
               
               
                  4.
                  The third, He muſt ſet his delight,
                  To heare and read Gods holy word,
                  And often meditate on it,
                  His goodneſſe daily to record.
               
               
                  5.
                  The fourth, He muſt remember well,
                  VVhat is contrary to Gods will,
                  To ſhunne that way which leads to Hell,
                  And pray for grace againſt all ill.
               
               
                  6.
                  The fift, He muſt the truth profeſſe,
                  And practiſe it accordingly,
                  That words and workes may both expreſſe,
                  He holdeth with the verity.
               
               
                  7.
                  The ſixt, He muſt do no man wrong,
                  For no reſpect in any caſe,
                  Nor any that to him belong,
                  But make amends (if he treſpaſse)
               
               
                  8.
                  The ſeauenth: He muſt be ready preſt,
                  To put vp wrongs at others hands,
                  And pray for them, (as for the reſt)
                  To rid them out of Sathans bands.
               
               
                  9.
                  The eight, He muſt be doing good,
                  Yea rich in good workes day by day,
                  To help the hungry vnto food,
                  And further learning all he may.
                  
                     10. The ninth: He muſt diſpoſe himſelfe,
                  To leaue the pleaſures of this life,
                  And greedy ſeeking worthy pelfe,
                  Which worketh woe and endleſſe ſtrife.
               
               
                  11.
                  The tenth: He muſt with patience,
                  Prepare himſelfe to beare Chriſts Croſſe,
                  Or any ſcourge for his offence,
                  Which in the end will gaine the loſſe.
               
               
                  12.
                  The eleuenth; He muſt prouide for death,
                  (As if his bed ſhould be his graue.)
                  To liue in peace, whilſt he hath breath,
                  That after Chriſt his ſoule may ſaue.
               
               
                  13.
                  The twelft, He muſt in all diſtreſſe,
                  Of ſickneſſe, paine, or puniſhment,
                  Then, hope for Chriſt his bleſſedneſſe,
                  VVhich aye ſhall laſt, when life is ſpent.
               
               
                  14.
                  The thirteenth, He muſt often pray.
                  That Sathans Kingdome may ſurceaſe,
                  And Chriſt his glory euery way,
                  May daily more and more increaſe.
               
               
                  15.
                  The fourteenth, He muſt euer long,
                  To be with Chriſt in his ſweete bliſſe,
                  To ſing that endleſſe ioyfull ſong,
                  All praiſe to him, whoſe right it is.
               
               
                  16.
                  The more that any mortall wight,
                  VVith theſe good graces doth abound,
                  The deerer he is in Gods ſight,
                  And ſo for euer ſhall be found.
               
               FINIS.
