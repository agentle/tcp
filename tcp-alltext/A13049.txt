            TO THE RIGHT Honorable, the Lord Mayor of the Citie of London, to the communaltie, and Citizens of the same, Iohn Stow Citizen, wisheth long health and felicitie.
            SInce the first publishing of the perambulation of Kent, by that learned Gentleman M. William Lambert Esquire, I haue hearde of sundry other able persons to haue (according to the desire of that author) assayed to doe somewhat for the particular Shires and Connties, where they were borne, or dwelt, of which none that I knowe (sauing M. Norden, for the Counties of Middlesex, & Hertford) haue vouchsafed their labors  to the commō good in that behalf. And therefore concurring with the first, in the same desire to haue drawn together such speciall descriptions of each place, as might not onely make vp an whole body of the English Chronographie amongst our selues: but also might giue occasion, and courage to M. Camdin to increase and beutifie his singular worke of the whole, to the view of the learned that be abroade. I haue attempted the discouery of London, my natiue soile and Countrie, at the desire and perswasion of some my good friendes, aswell because I haue seene sundrie antiquities my selfe touching that place, as also for that through search of Recordes to other purposes, dyuers written helpes are come to my handes, which few others haue fortuned to meete withall, it is a seruice that most agreeth with my  professed trauelles. It is a duty, that I willingly ow to my natiue mother & Countrie. And an office that of right I holde my selfe bound in loue to bestow vpon the politike body and members of the same: what London hath beene of auncient time, men may here see, as what it is now euery man doth behold: I know that the argument, being of the chiefe and principall Citie of the land, required the penne of some excellent Artisen, but fearing that none woulde attempt, and finish it, as few haue assayed any, I chose rather (amongst other my Laboures) to handle it after my plaine manner, then to leaue it vnperformed. Touching the Dedication, I am not doubtfull where to seeke my patrone, since you be a politique estate of the Citie, as the walles & buildinges be the materiall partes of the same. To  you therefore, doe I addresse this my whole labour, as well that by your authority I may be protected, as warranted by your own skill and vnderstanding of that which I haue written, I confes that I lacked my desire to the accō
               plishment of some speciall partes; but I trust hereafter that shalbe supplied, and I professe (if more touching this worke come vnto me) to afforde it, in all dutie. In the meane time, I recommend this to your view, my laboures to your consideration, and my selfe to your seruice, (as I haue professed during life) in this or any other.

            A Suruay of London, conteyning the originall, antiquitie, increase, moderne estate, and description of that Cittie.
            AS Rome the chiefe Citie of the world to glorifie it selfe, drew her originall from the Gods, Goddesses, and demy Gods, by the Troian progeny. So this famous Citie of London for greater glorie, and in emulation of Rome, deriueth it selfe from the very same originall. For (as Ieffery of Monmoth,
               Geffery Mommoth. the Welche Historian reporteth Brute descended from the demy god Eneas, the sonne of Venus, daughter of Iupiter, aboute the yeare of the world 2855. the yeare before Christes natiuitie, 1108. builded a Citie neare vnto a riuer now called Thames, and named it Troynouant. or Trenouant.
               Trinouantum hath the writen Copies.
            
            King Lud afterwarde not onely repayred this Cittie, but also added fayre buildings, Towres, and wals, and called it after his owne name Caire-Lud
               Caire-Lud, the Citie of Lud, but Luds town is a Saxon word. or Luds towne, and the strong gate which he builded in the west part of the Cittie, hée likewise for his owne honor named it Ludgate.
            
            This Lud had issue two sons, Androgeus, and Themantius, who being not of age to gouerne at the death of their Father: their Unckle Cassibilan, tooke vpon him the crowne, about the eight yeare of whose raigne, Iulius Cesar ariued in this land with a greate power of Romains to conquer it, the manner of which conquest I will summarily set down out of his own Commentaries, which are of farre better credit, then the relations of Geffery Monmouth.
               Cesars Comentaries. liber. 5.
            
            The chiefe gouernement of the Britons, and ordering of the warres, was then by common aduice committed to Cassibilan, whose Signiorie was seperated from the Cities towardes the sea coast, by the riuer called Thames, about fourescore miles from the sea, this Cassibilan in times past, had made continuall warre vpon the Cities adioyning, but the Britons being moued with  the Romaines inuasion, had resolued in that necessitie to make him their Soueraigne and Generall of the warres (which continued hot betwéene the Romains and them) but in the meane while, the Trinobantes
               Trinobants Citizens of London which was then the strongest Cittie well neare of al those countries (and out of which Citie a young gentleman called Mandubrace, vpon confidence of Celars helpe, came vnto him into the maine land of Gallia now called France, and thereby escaped death, which he should haue suffered at Cassibilans hande,) sent their Ambassadors to Cesar, promising to yeeld vnto him, and to doe what he should commande them, instantly desiring him, to protect Mandubrace from the furious tirannie of Cassibilan, and to send him into their Cittie, with authority to take the gouernment thereof vpon him. Cesar accepted the offer, and appointed them to geue vnto him 40. Hostages, and withall to finde him graine for his army, and so sent he Mandubrace
               Mādubrace and the Trinobants yeeld to Cesar, and he defended them. vnto them.
            When others saw that Cesar had not onelie defended the Trinobantes against Cassibilan, but had also saued them harmeles from the pillage of his own souldiers, then did the Conimagues, Segontians, Ancalits, Bibrokes, and Cassians, likewise submit themselues vnto him, and by them he learned that not farre from thence was Cassibilans towne,Cassibilans towne west from London for Cesar saith 80. miles from the sea, Cities of the Britaines were combersom woods fortified. fortified with woods, and marish ground, into the which hee had gathered a greate number both of men and cattell.
            For the Brittons call that a town (saith Cesar) when they haue fortified a combarsom wood with a ditch and rampire, and thether they resorte to abide the approach of their ennemies, to this place therefore marched Cesar, with his Legions, hee founde it excellent
                  •
               ie fortified both of nature, and by mans aduice: neuerthelesse he resolued to assault it in two seuerall places at once, whereupon the Brittons being not able to endure the force of the Romaines, fled out at an other parte, and left the towne vnto him: a greate number of cattell he found there, and many of the Britons he slew, and other he tooke in the chase.
            Whilst these thinges were a doing in these quarters, Cassibilan sent messengers into Kent, which lieth vpon the sea, in which there raigned then 4. particular kinges, named Cingetorix, Car
                  
                     •
                  il, Taximagul, and Segonax, whome he commanded to raise all  their forces, and suddenly to set vppon, and assault the Romaines, in their trenches, by the sea side: the which when the Romaines perceiued, they salied out vpon them, slew a greate sorte of them, and taking Cingetorix their noble Captaine prisoner, retired themselues to their Campe in good safety.
            When Cassibilan harde of this, and had formerly taken many other losses, and found his countrie sore wasted, and himselfe left almost alone by the defection of the other Cities, he sent Ambassadors by Connius of Arras, to Cesar, to entreate with him, concerning his own submission, the which Cesar did accept, and taking Hostages, assessed the Realme of Britaine,
               Britaine sessed to pay a yerely tribute to the Romaines. to a yearely tribute, to be payed to the people of Rome, giuing straight charge to Cassibilan, that he should not séeke any reuenge vpon Mandubrace or the Trinobantes, and so withdrew his armie to the sea againe.
            Thus farre out of Cesars Commentaries concerning this Historie, which happened in the yeare before Christes natiuitie 54. in all which processe there is for this purpose to bee noted, that Cesar nameth the Citie of Trinobantes, which hath a resemblance with Troy noua or Trinobantum, which hath no greater difference in the Orthographie, then changing b. into v. and yet maketh an error which I will not argue, onely this I will note that diuers learned men do not thinke ciuitas Trinobantum
               Trinobant, new London. to be well and truely translated, the Citie of the Trinobantes: but it should rather be the state, comonalty, or Signiory, of the Trinobantes: for that Cesar in his Comentaries vseth the worde ciuitas, onely for a people liuing vnder one, and the selfe same Prince and law but certaine it is that the Cities of the Britaines,
               Cities of the Britans not artificially builded with houses nor walled. with stone were in those daies neither artificially builded with houses, nor strongly walled with stone, but were onely thicke and combarsom woodes plashed within and trenched aboute: and the like in effect do other the Romaine and Greeke autors directly affirme, as Strabo Pomponius Mela, and Dion

               e ouer all Europe, this Citie whatsoeuer it was before, began to bee renowned, and of fame.
            For Tacitus, who first of all Autors nameth it Londinum, sayth that in the 62. after Christ it was albeit, no Colonie of the Romaines, yet most famousLondon most famus for Marchantes and intercourse. for the greate multitude of Marchantes, prouision, and intercourse. At which time in that notable reuolte of the B

                  itons from Nero, in which 70000. Romaines & their leager fellowes were slaine, this Citie with Verulam nere S. Albons, and Maldon, then all famous: were ransacked and spoiled.
            For Suetonius Paulinus then Lieftennant for the Romaines in this Isle, abandoned it: as not then forseyied, and left it to the spoile.
            Shortly after, Iulius Agricola, the Romaine Liefetennant, in the time of Domitian, was the first that by adhorting the Britaines,
               The Britons had no houses, but cottages. publikely, and helping them priuately, wun them to builde houses for themselues, temples for the Gods, and courtes for Iustice, to bring vp the noblemens children in good letters and humanity, and to apparrell themselues Romaine like, whereas before (for the most parte) they went naked, painting their bodies &c. as all the Romaine writers haue obserued.The Britons went naked their bodies painted.
            
            True it is I confesse, that afterwarde many Cities and Towns in Britaine vnder the gouernement of the Romaines, were walled with stone, & baked bricks, or tyles, as Richborrow, or Ryptacester, in the Isle of Thanet, til the channell altered his course, besides Sandwitch, in Kent, Verulamium
               Richborow in Kent Verulamium. Cilcester Roxcester Kenchester. Keyland. Of the wal, about London. besides S. Albones, in Hartfordshire, Cilcester, in Hampshire, Roxcester in Shrop shire, Kenchester in Herefordshire, thrée miles from Hereford towne, Ribchester, 7. miles aboue Preston, on the water of Rible, Aldeburge a mile from Borrowbridge, or Wathelingstreet, on Vre Riuer and others, & no doubt but this our Citie of London, was also walled with stone, in the time of the Romaine gouernement here, but yet very lately, for it seemeth not to haue beene walled in the yeare of our Lorde 296. because in that yeare  when Alectus the Tyran was slaine in the field, the Frankes easily entred London, and had sacked the same, had not God of his greate fauour, at the very instant brought along the riuer of Thames, certaine bandes of Romaine Souldiers, who slew those Frankes in euerie streete of the Cittie.
            In few yeares after, as Simeon of Durham,
               Simeon of Durham. an ancient writer reporteth, Hellen the mother of Constantine the greate, was the first that inwalled it aboute the yeare of Christ 306. howsoeuer those wals of stone might be builded by Helen, yet the Bri
                     •
                  ōs, (I know) had no skil of building with stone, as it may appeare by that, which followeth about the yere after Christ, 399, when Arcadius
& Honorius the sonnes of Theodosius Magnus, gouerned the Empire, the one in the East, the other in the West, for Honorius hauing receiued Britaine, the Citie of Rome was inuaded and destroyed, by the Gathes after which time the Romaines leftThe Romaines left to gouerne Britaine. to rule in Britaine, as being, imployed in defence of their Territories nerer home, whereupon the Britains not able to defende themselues against the inuasions of their enemies, were many yeres together vnder the oppression of two most cruell nations, the Scots and Pictes,
               The Scots and Picts inuade this land. and at the length were forced to send their Ambassadors with letters and lamentable supplications, to come, requiring aide and succour from thence, vpon promise of their continuall fealtie, so that the Romaines woulde rescue them out of the handes of their ennemies. Hereupon the Romaines sent vnto them a Legion of armed Souldiers, which comming into this Iland, and incountering with the ennemies, ouerthrew a great number of them, and draue the rest out of the frontiers of the countrie, and so setting the Britaines at liberty, counselled them to make a wall, extending all along betwéene the twoo seas, which might be of force to kéepe out their euill neighbours, and then returned home with greate triumph: But the Britaines
               Britaines vnskilfull of building with stone wanting Masons builded that wall not of stone as they were aduised, but made it of turfe, and that so slender, that it serued litle or nothing at al for their defence: and the ennemie perceiuing that the Romaine Legiō
                was returned home, forthwith arriued, out of their boates, inuaded the borders, ouercame the countrie, and as it were, bare down al that was before them.
            
               Whereupon Ambassadors were eftsoones dispatched to Rome, lamentably beseeching that they woulde not suffer their miserable countrey to be vtterly destroyed: then againe an other Legion was sent, which comming vpon a suddaine, made a greate slaughter of the ennemie, and chased him home, euen vnto his own country. These Romaines at their departure, tolde the Britaines plainely, that it was not for their ease or leasure to take vpon them any more such long and laborious iournyes for their defence, and therefore 
                  •
               ad them practise the vse of armour and weapons, and learne to withstand their ennemies, whome nothing else did make so strong as their faint hart, and cowardise, and for so much as they thought that it would be no small helpe and encouragement vnto their Tributary frendes whom they were now forced to forsake,Witichindus. they builded for them a wall of harde stone from the west sea to the east sea, right betwéene those two Cities, which were there made to kéepe out the ennemies, in the selfe same place where Seuerus before had cast his Trench.Wal of ston builded by the Romās. bewtixt the Britans, and Scots. The Britaines also putting to their helping handes as laborers.
            This wall they builded 8. foote thicke in breadth, and 12. foote in height, right as it were by a lyne, from east to west, as the ruines thereof remaining in many places til this day, do make to appeare. Which worke thus perfected, they giue the people straight charge to looke well to themselues, they teach them to handle their weapons, and they instruct them in warlike feates. And lest by the sea side southwardes, where their ships lay at harbor, the ennemie should come on land, they made vp sundrie Bulwarkes each some what distant from the other, and so bid them farewell as minding no more to returne. This happened in the daies of the Emperour Theodosius the younger almost 500. yeares after the first ariuall of the Romaines here, aboute the yeare after Christes incarnation, 434.
            The Britaines after this, continuing a lingering & doubtful war with the Scots and Pictes, made choice of Vortiger, to bee their king and leader, which man (as sayth Malmesbery,
               Malmsbery. Bede.) was neither valorous of courage, nor wise of counsell, but wholy giuen ouer to the vnlawful lusts of his flesh: the people likewise in short time, being growne to some quietnes gaue themselues to gluttony,The Britains giuen to gluttony, dronkennes, pride and 
                     •
                  ontention. and  drunkennes, pride, contention, enuie, and such other vices, casting from them the yoke of Christ. In the meane season a bitter plague fell among them, consuming in short time such a multitude, that the quicke were not sufficient to bury the deade, and yet the remnant remayned so hardened in sinne, that neither the death of their frendes nor feare of their owne daunger, could cure the mortality of their soules, whereupon a greater stroke of vengeance insued vpon the whole sinfull nation.The Britaines plagued for their sinfull life. For being now againe infested with their old neighbors the Scots, and Pictes, they consult with their king Vortiger, and send for the Saxons, who shortly after ariued here in Britaine, where saith Bede,
               Witichendus
                     •
                   Bede. they were receiued as frends: but as it proued they minded to destroy the countrie as ennemies for after that they had driuen out the Scots and Pictes, they also draue the Britaines some ouer the seas, and some into the waste mountaines of Wales and Cornewell, and deuided the countrie into diuers kingdomes amongst themselues.The Saxons sent for to defend the Britaines, but they draue thē into the mountains.
            
            These Saxons were likewise ignorant of the Architecture or building with stone,Saxons vnskilful of building with stone. vntill the yere of Christ 680. for then it is affirmed that Bennet Abbote of Wirall, Maister to the reuerend Bede, first brought Masons and Workemen in stone into this Iland amongst the Saxons,
               Benet a monk brought masons into this land amongst the Saxons. (he I say) brought hyther Artificers of stone houses, Paynters and Glasiers, artes before that time vnto the Saxons vnknowne, who before that time vsed but wodden buildinges.
            Thus much be sayed for walling, not onely in respect of this City, but generally also of the first, within the Realme. Now to returne to our Trinouant,
               Trinouāt since called Londō. (as Cesar hath it) the same is since by Tacitus, Ptolomeus, and Antoninus called Londinium, Longidinum, of Amiamus, Lundinum, and Augusta who calleth it an auncient Citie of our Britaines Lundayne, of the olde Saxons, Lundonceaster, Londonbeig, of strangers, Londra and Londres, of the inhabitants, London, whereof you may reade a more large and learned discourse, and how it tooke the name in that worke of my louing frend M.

Wals of London repayred writing in the raigne of king Henry the second, of the wals of this Citie, hath these words. The wal is high and great, well towred on the Northside with due distances betweene the towers. On the southside also the Citie was walled and towred, but the fishful riuer of Thames with his ebbing, and flowing hath long since subuerted them.
            
            This may suffice for proofe of a wall, and forme thereof, about this Citie, and the same to haue béene of greate antiquity, as any other within this Realme, and now touching the maintenance & repayring the saide wals, I finde that in the yere 1215, the 16. of King Iohn, the Barons entring the Citie by Ealdgate,
               Roger of Windouer. Mathew Paris, Randulph Cocshall. first tooke assurance of the Citizens, and then they brake into the houses of the Iewes, and searched their coffers, and after with greate diligence repayred the wals, and the gates of the Citie of London with stone, taken from the Iewes broken houses. In the yeare 1257. Henry the 3. caused the wals of the Citie of London, which were sore deca

               ed and destitute of Towers, to be repayred in more seemely wise then before, at the common charges of the Citie. Also in the yeare 1282.Mathew Paris King Edward the first granted to H. VValleis Maior, and the Citizens of London, the fauour, to take toward the making of the wall, and inclosure of the Citie, certaine customes, as appeareth by his grante. This wal was then to be  made from Ludgate to Fleete bridge, and along by the water of Fleete, vnto the riuer of Thames. Moreouer in the yere 1310. Edward the 2. commanded the Citizens to make vp the wal alredy begunne, and the Tower, at the ende of the same wall, within the water of Thames neare vnto the blacke Fryers &c. It was also granted by king Richard the socond in the 10. of his raign that a Toll shoulde be taken of wares, solde by lande and by water for 10. yeares, towardes the repayring of the wals and clensing of the ditch aboute London. In the 17. of Edward the 4. Ralfe Ioceline, Mayor, caused parte of the wall aboute the Citie of London,
               Pattent. to be rapayred, to wit, betwixt Aldgate and Aldersgate he also caused the Morefielde to bee searched for clay, and willed bricke to be made, and brent there, he likewise caused chalke to bee brought out of Kent and to be brent into lime in the same Morefield, for more furtherance of the worke. Then the Skinners, to begin in the East, made that parte of the wall, betwixt Algate and Buries marke towardes Bishopsgate, as may appeare by their armes in thrée places fixed there, the Mayor with his cō
               pany of the Drapers made all that part, betwixt Bishopsgate & Alhallowes Church in the same, and from Alhallowes towards the Posterne. A great part of the same wal called Moregate was repayred by the executors of Sir Iohn Crosby, late Alderman, as may appeare by his Armes, standing in two places there. Other Companies repayred the rest of the wal to the Posterne of Criplegate. The Goldsmiths repayred frō

               AUnciently vntill the Conquerors time, and 200. yeres after, the Citie of London was watered besides the famous Riuer of Thames, on the South part, with the riuer of the wels, as it was then called on the west, with a water called walbrooke, runing through the middest of the Citie into the riuer of Thames seruing the hart thereof. And with a fourth water or Boorne, which ran within the Citie, through Langboorne warde, watering that parte in the East. In the west Suburbes was also an other greate water, called Oldborne, which had his fall into the Riuer of wels: then was there 3. principall Fountaines, or wels in the other Suburbes, to wit Holly well, Clements well, and Clarkes wel. Neare vnto this last named fountaine, were diuers other wels, to wit Skinners well, Fags well, Tede well, Leders well, and Radwell. In west Smithfield there was a Poole, in recordes called Horsepoole, And one other Poole neare vnto the parish Church of S. Giles without Criplegate. Besides all which they had in euery streete and lane of the City diuers fayre wels, and fresh springes: and after this manner was this Citie then serued, with sweete & fresh waters, which being since decayed, other meanes haue beene sought to supply the want, as shall bee shewed, but first of the aforenamed Riuers and other waters, is to be said, as followeth.

                  lde time, and that they leaue nothing that may hurt or stop it, but keepe it in the same estate, that it was wont to bee: so farre the recorde. Whereupon it followed that the saide riuer,Riuer socalled in the yeare 1307. was at that time clensed, these mils remoued, and other thinges done for the preseruation of the course thereof, notwithstanding neuer brought to the old depth, and breadth, whereupon the name of riuer ceased, and it was since called a Brooke, namely Turnmil or Tremill Brooke,Turnemill brooke. for that diuers mils were erected vpon it, as appeareth by a fayre Register booke, conteyning the foundation of the Priorie at Clarken wel, and donation of the landes, thereunto belonging, as also by diuers other recordes.
               This brooke hath beene diuers times since clensed, namely and last of all to any effect. In the yeare 1502. the 17. of Henry the 7. the whole course of Fleete dike, then so called was scowred (I say) down to the Thames, so that boates with fish and fewell were rowed to Fleete bridge and to Oldborne bridge, as they of olde time had beene accustomed, which was a great commodity to all the inhabitantes in that part of the City.
               In the yeare 1589. was granted a fifteene, by a common Councell of the Cittie, for the clensing of this Brooke or dike and the money amounting to a thousand markes was collected,Fleete dike promised to be clensed

                   caused no smal hindrance to the Canons of the holy Trinity, whose church stoode neare vnto Aldgate: for that the saide ditch passed through their grounde, from the Tower of London, vnto Bishopsgate. This ditch being originally made for the defence of the cittie was long together carefully clensed and mainteyned as neede required, but now of late neglected and forced eyther to a very narrow and the same a filthy channel, or altogether stopped vp for gardens planted, and houses builded thereon euen to the very wall, and in many places vpon both ditch and wall, to what danger of the citie, I leaue to wiser consideration: and can but wish, that reformation  might be had.
               In the yeare of Christ, 1354. the 28. of Edwarde the third, the ditch of this citie flowing ouer the banke into the Tower ditch the king commanded the saide ditch of the citie to be clensed, and so ordered, that the ouerflowing thereof, should not force any filth into the Tower ditch. Anno 1379. Iohn Filpot Maior of London caused this ditch to be clensed and euery household to pay v.

                  . which was for a daies worke towardes the charges thereof. Richarde the 2. in the tenth of his raigne, granted a Tole to bee taken of wares solde by water, or by lande for 10. yeares towardes repayring of the wall and clensing of the ditch.
               
                  Thomas Fawconer Mayor 1414. caused the ditch to be clensed. Ralf Ioceline, Maior 1477. caused the whole ditch to be cast and clensed, and so from time to time it was clensed and otherwise reformed.
               In my remembrance also the same was clensed, namely the Moore ditch, when Sir Wiliam Hollies was Maior in the yeare 1540. And not long before or after, from the Tower of London, to Aldgate. It was againe clensed in the yere 1549. Henry Amcotes being Mayor,Plentie of fish in the towne ditch. at the charges of the companies at which time the saide ditch lay open without eyther wall or pale, hauing therein great store of very good fish of diuers sortes, as many men yet liuing who haue taken and tasted them, can well witnes: but now no such matter the charge of clensing that ditch is saued & great profit made by letting out the banks with the spoile of the whole ditch. I am not ignorant of two fifeteenes granted by a common counsell in the yeare 1595. for the reformation of this ditch, and that a smal portion thereof, to wit, betwixt Bishopsgate, and the Posterne called Moregate, was clensed and made somewhat broder: but filling againe very fast, by reason of ouer raising the ground neare adioyning, therefore neuer the better: and I will so leaue it.

Marie Oueries church aboue the Quier, where she was buried, vnto the which house the gaue the ouersight and profites of the Ferrie, but afterwardes the saide house of Sisters being conuerted into a colledge of Priestes, the Priestes builded the Bridge (of Tymber)Londō bridge builded of timber. as all other the greate bridges of this Land were, and from time to time kept the same in good reparation, till at length considering the greate charges of repayring the same there was by aide of the Citizens of London and others a bridge builded of stone as shal be shewed.

               Moreouer in the yeare 1016. Canute the Dane with a greate nauie came vp to London, and on the south of the Thames, caused a Trench to bee cast, through the which his ships were towed into the west side of the bridge, and then with a deepe Trench and streight siege he compassed the citie round aboute.
               Also in the yeare 1052. Earle Godwin with the like nauie, taking his course vp the Riuer of Thames, and finding none that  offered to resist on the bridge, he sayled vp by the southside of the said riuer. Furthermore aboute the yeare 1067. Wiliam the Conqueror in his Charter, to the church of S. Peter at westminster, confirmed to the Monkes seruing God there, a gate in London, then called Buttolphes gate, with a wharfe which was at the heade of London bridge.

I commande by my kingly authority that the Mannor called Alcestone, which my Father gaue with other Landes, to the Abbey of Battle, be free and quiete from shieres and hundredes, and all other Customes of earthly seruitude, as my father helde the same, most freely and quietely, and namely from the worke of London bridge, and the worke of the Castle at Penansey: and this I command vpon my forfeyture, witnesse VVilliam de Pontlearche at Byrry, the which Charter with the Scale very fayre remaineth in the custody of Ioseph Holland Gentleman.
               In the yeare 1136. the first of king Stephen,

For Fitzstephen writeth that in the raigne of king Stephen and of Henry the second, when pastimes were shewed on the riuer of Thames, men stoode in greate numbers on the bridge, wharfes, and houses to beholde.
               Now in the yeare 1163. the same bridge was not onely repayred,  but new made of Timber as afore by Peter of Cosechurch, Priest and Chaplaine.

Chaplens in the saide chappell, after that example sundry houses were thereupon shortly after erected, the first action on this bridge was lamentable, for within 3. yeres after the finishing thereof, to wit, in the yeare 1212. on the 10. of Iuly at night, a maruelous terrible chance happened, for the citie of London vpon the south side of the riuer of Thames as also the  church of our Ladie of the Canons in Southwarke being on fire,Liber dunmew.

Aboute the yeare 1282. through a greate frost and deepe snow, 5. Arches of London bridge, were borne downe5. Arches of London bridg borne downe and carried away. In the yeare 1289. the bridge was so sore decayed, for want of reparations, that men were afraid to passe thereon, and a Subsidy was graunted towardes the amendement thereof, Sir Iohn Britaine being Custos of London. In the yeare 1395. on S. Georges day, was a greate iusting on London bridge, betwixt Dauid Earle Craforde of Scotland, and the Lorde VVels of England: in the which, the Lord VVels was at the third course borne out of the saddle, which historie prooueth, that at that time the bridge being coaped on eyther side was not replenished with houses builded thereupon, as since it hath beene and now is. The next yeare on the 13. of Nouember, the young Queene Isabell, commonly called the little, for she was but 8. yeares olde, was conueyed from Kenington besides Lamhith, through Southwarke to the, Tower of London, and such a multitude of people went out to see her, that on London bridge. 9. persons were crowded to death,9. persons crowded to death on London bridge Tower on London bridg builded. of whome the Prior of Tiptre a place in Essex was one, and a Matron on Cornhil was an other.

Under this bridge runneth a water sometimes called (as I haue said) the riuer of the VVels, since Turnemill brooke, now Fleete dike, because it runneth by the Fleete, and so vnder Fleete bridge, into the riuer of Thames. This bridge hath beene far greater in times past, but hath beene lessened, as the water course hath béene narrowed. It seemeth, this last bridge to bee made at the charges of Iohn VVels Mayor in the yeare, 1431. for on the coping is engrauen Wels imbraced by Angels, like as on the Standarde in Cheape, which he also builded: thus much of the Bridge: for of the water course and decay thereof I haue spoken in an other place.

                  Bridges ouer the course of Walbrooke. I read that euery person hauing landes on eyther side of the saide walbrooke, should vaulte, or bridge, and clense the same so farre as his landes extended. The 11. of Edwarde the thirde, the inhabitantes vpon the course of this Brooke were forced to pile and wall the sides thereof. In the thirde of Henry the fift, this watercourse hauing had many bridges, (as ye haue hearde) I haue reade of one by the name of Horshew bridge,
                  Horshew bridge. by the Church of S. Iohn Baptist now called S. Iohns vpon walbrooke, which hath béene since vaulted ouer with bricke, and the Streetes and Lanes where through it passed so paued, that the same watercourse or brooke is now hardly discerned. Order was taken the 2. of Edwaarde the fourth, that such as had ground on eyther side of walbrooke, shoulde vaulte and paueWalbrooke vaulted and paued. it ouer so farre as his grounde extended. And thus much for Bridges may suffice.

In the raigne of Henry the second (saith Fitzstephen) there were seuen double gates in the wall of this Citie, but he nameth them not. It may be supposed he ment for the first, the gate next to the Tower of London, which then serued as a Posterne for Passengers out of the East: from thence through Towerstreete, Eastcheape, and Candleweekestrete, to Londonstone, the midle point of that high way: then through Budgerow, wathelingstreete, and leauing Paules Church on the right hand, to Ludgate in the west, the next be Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Criplegate, Aldersgate, Ludgate, and the Bridgegate, ouer the Thames. Since the which time hath been builded Newgate, the Posterne called Moregate, a Posterne from Christeshospital, towardes S. Bartelmewes Hospitall in Smithfielde &c. Of euery of these gates and Posterns as also of certeine watergates seuerally somewhat may bée noted, as I finde authority to warrant mee.

                  Bishopsgate. for that, as it may be supposed, the same was first builded by some Bishoppe of London, the certaynty whereof is vnknown, but true it is that this gate was first builded for the ease of the passengers towards the East and by North, as into Norfolke, Suffolke, Cambridgeshire,
&c. The Trauellers into which parts before the building of this gate were forced, passing out at Aldegate, to goe east till they came to the Miles end, & then to turne on the left hand to Blethenhal green now called Bednal greene, to Cambridge heath, and so North, or East and by North, as their Iourney lay. If they tooke not this way, by the East out at Aldgate, they must take their way by the North out at Aldersgate through Aldersgate streete, and Goswelstreete towards Iseldon, and by a crosse of stone on their right hand, set vp for a marke by the North ende of Golding lane to turne Eastwarde through a long streete vntill this day called Aldestreete, to an other crosse standing, where now standeth a Smithes Forge by Sewers ditch church, and then to turne againe North towardes Totenham, Endfield, Waltham, Ware, &c.

Next I reade in a CharterCharter. dated the yere 1235. that Walter Brune Citizen of London, and Rosia his wife founded the Priorie or new Hospital of our blessed Lady, since called S. Mary Spittle, without Bishopsgate, for Canons regular the 19. of Henry the thirde. Also in the yeare 1247. Simon Fitzmarie, one of the Sherifes of London, the 29. of H. the thirde, founded the Hospitall of S. Marie,
                  Recorde. called Bethlem without Bishopsgate. Thus much for Antiquitie, now for repayring of this gate. I find, that Henry the thirde graunted or confirmed to the Marchantes of the Haunce,Liber custome, London. that had an house in the citie called Guildhalla Theutonicorum, certaine Liberties and Priuiledges. Edwarde the first also confirmed the same. In the 10. yeare of whose raigne, it was founde that the saide Marchantes ought of right so repayre the saide gate called Bishopsgate. Whereupon Gerarde Marbod, Alderman of the Haunce and other, then remayning in the Citie of London: for themselues, and al others Marchants of the saide hance, granted, 210. markes sterling to the Maior and Citizens. And couenanted that they and their successors should from time to time repayre the same gate.Bishopsgate repared by the Marchants of the Haunce Bishopsgate was builded. This gate was againe beutifully builded in the yere 1479. in the raigne of Edwarde the 4. by the saide Haunce Marchantes: Mor

                   and there builded a Posterne, now called Moregate, vppon the Moore side where was neuer gate before. This gate he made for ease of the Citizens, that way to passe vppon causewaies into the fielde, for their recreation: For the same fielde was at that time a Marrish. This Posterne was reedified by William Hampton Fishmonger Maior, in the yeare 1472. In the yeare also, 1511. the thirde of Henry the eight. Roger Achely Maior, caused Dikes and Bridges to bee made, and the ground to bee leuiled, and made more commodious for passage since which time the same hath beene heighthened. So much that the Ditches and Bridges are couered, and if it bee made leuill with the Battlementes of the Citie wall: yet will it bee little the drier, such is the Moorish nature of the grounde.

Markes, and the stuffe of the olde gate, called Criples gate, to builde the same gate of new, which was performed and done, in the yeare 1491. The next is Aldresgate or Aldersgate,
                  Aldersgate. so called not of Aldrich, or of Elders, that is to say, auncient men, builders thereof,Beware the Cat. nor of Eldarne trées growing there more aboundantly, then in other places, as some haue fabuled, but for the very antiquitie of the gate it selfe, as being one of the first foure gates of the cittie, and seruing for the Northerne partes, as Aldegate did for the East, which two gates being both old gates, are for difference sake called, the one Aldegate, and the other Aldergate. This gate hath at sundry times béene increased with buildinges, namely, on the south or innerside, a great frame of timber hath béene added and set vp, contayning diuers large roomes, and lodgeinges: also on the East side, is the addition of one great building of timber, with one large floore paued with stone, or tile, and a Well therein curbed with stone, of a great depth, and rysing into the said roome, which is two stories high from the ground: which Well is the onely peculiar note belonging to that gate, for I haue not séene the like in all this Cittie, to be raysed so high. Iohn Day Stationer, a late famous printer of many good bookes, in our time dwelled in this gate, and builded much vpon the wall of the cittie towards the parish Church of Saint Anne. Then is there also a Posterne gate made out of the wall on the North side of the late dissolued cloyster of Friers minors, commonly of their habite called Gray Friers, now Christes Church, and Hospitall.A Postern out of Christes Ho

               The next gate on the west, and by North, is termed Newgate,

The Cathedrall Church of Saint Paule, being burnt about the yeare 1086. in the raigne of VVilliam the Conqueror, Mauritius then Bishoppe of London, rapayred not the old

After Mauritius, Richard Beamore did wonderfully aduance the work of the said Church, purchasing the large stréetes, and lanes round about, wherein were wont to dwell many lay people, which grounds he began to compasse about with a strong wall of stone, and gates. By meanes of this increase of the Church territorie, but more by inclosing of grounde, for so large a cemitorie, or church yarde: the high and large stréete stretching from Aldegate in the East, vntill Ludgate in the West, was in this place so crossed and stopped vp, that the carriage through the cittie Westwarde, was forced to passe without the saide churchyarde wall on the North side, through Pater noster row: and then south down Aue Mary lane, and againe West through Bowiar row to Ludgate: or else out of Chepe, or Wathelingstreet to turne South through the old Exchaunge, then West through Carter lane: againe North vp Créede lane, and then West to Ludgate. Which passage, by reason of so often turning, was very combersome, and daungerous both for horse and man.Newgate first builded, and the cause why. For remedie whereof, a new gate was made, and so called, by which men and cattell with all manner of carriages, might passe more directly (as afore) from Aldegate, through West Cheape by Paules on the North side, through Saint Nicholas Shambles, and Newgate market to Newgate, and from thence to any part Westwarde ouer Oldborne bridge, or turning without the gate into Smithfielde, and through Iseldon to any part North and by West.

King Henry the thirde lodging in the Tower of London, vppon displeasure conceyued towards the Cittie of London, for the escape of Iohn Offrem a prisoner being a Clearke conuict, out of Newgate, which had killed a Prior that was of alliance to the King, as cosen to the Queene, he sent for the Mayor and Sheriffes to come before him, to aunswere the matter: the Mayor laid the fault from him to the Sheriffes,The Shiriffes of London prisoners in the Tower for escape of a prisoner out of Newgate. forsomuch as to them belonged the keeping of all prisoners within the cittie, and so the Mayor returned home, but the Sheriffes remayned there prisoners, by the space of one Moneth and more, and yet they excused themselues in that the fault chiefly rested in the Bishops Officers: for whereas the prisoner was vnder custodie, they at his request had graunted licence to imprison the offendor within the Gaile of Newgate, but so as the Bishops Officers were charged to sée him safely kept. The King notwithstanding all this, demanded of the cittie 3000. markes for a fine. In the yeare 1326. Robert Baldoke, the kinges Chancellor was put in Newgate.

The 17. of King Iohn the Barons of the Realme, being in armes against the King entred this Citie, and spoyled the Iewes houses, to fill their owne purses which being done, Robert Fitzwater, and Geffrey de Magna villa Earle of Essex, and the Earle of Gloucester chiefe leaders of the Army, applyed all diligence to repayre the gates and walles of this Citie, with the stones of the Iewes broken houses, especially (as it séemeth) they then repayred or rather new builded Ludgate.
                  Ludgate new builded. For in the yeare 1586. when the same gate was taken down to be newe builded, there was found couched within the wall thereof, a stone taken from one of the Iewes houses, wherein was ingrauen in Hebrewe Caracters these wordes following,

In the yeare 1439 the tenth of King Henry the sixt, Iohn Welles being Mayor, & court of common counsaile established ordinanances, (as William Standon & Robert Chicheley, late Maiors before had done) touching the garde and gouernment of Ludgate, and other prisons.
               Also in the yeare 1463. the third of Edward the fourth, Mathew Philip being Mayor, in a common counsaile, at the request of the well disposed, blessed, and deuout woman, Dame Agnes Forster, widow, late wife to Stephen Forster Fishemonger, sometime Mayor, for the comfort and reliefe of all the poore prisoners, certaine Articles were established. Inprimis, that the new works then late edified by the same Dame Agnes, for the inlarging of the prison of Ludgate, from thenceforth should be had and taken,  as a parte and parcell of the saide prison of Ludgate, so that both the olde and new worke of Ludgate aforesaid, be one prison, gaile, kéeping, and charge for euermore.
               The saide Quadrant strongly builded of stone, by the before named Stephen Forster, and Agnes his wife, contayneth a large walking place by grounde, the like roome it hath ouer it for lodgings, and ouer all a fayre leades to walke vpon, well imbattayled, all for ease of prisoners, to the end they shoulde haue lodging and water frée without charge: as by certaine verses grauen in Copper,
& fixed on the said Quadrant, I haue read in forme following.Old verses on Ludgate.

               This plate, and one other of his Armes, taken downe with the old gate, I caused to be fixed ouer the entrie of the said Quadrant, but the verses being vnhappily turned inward to the wall, the like in effect is grauen outwarde in prose, declaring him to bee a Fishmonger, because some vpon a light occasion (as a maydens heade in a glasse window) had fabuled him to bee a Mercer, and to haue begged there at Ludgate, &c. Thus much for Ludgate.
               
               Next this, is there a breach in the wal of the Citie,A breach in the wal against Bridewell. and a bridge of timber ouer the Fleet dike, betwixt Fléet bridge and Thames, directly ouer against the house of Bridewel.
               
               Of the water gates of name, on the banke of the riuer of Thames. The first from the West towardes the East, is called Ripa Reginae, the Quéens bank, or Quéene Hith,Watergates Queenes hith which may wel be accounted a water gate, & the very chief of this citie, being a common strand or landing place, yet equal with, & of old time as far excelling Belins gate, as shalbe shewed in the ward of Quéene Hith.
               The next is Downe gate,Downe gate. so called (as may be supposed) of the sodaine descending, or downe going of that way from S. Iohns Church vpon Walbrooke vnto the Riuer of Thames, whereby the water in the channell there hath such aswift course, that in the  yeare 1574. on the fourth of September after a strong shower of rayne, a lad (of the age of 18. yeares)A lad of 13. yeares old. drowned in a channell at downegate. minding to haue leapt ouer the channell, was taken by the féete and borne downe with the violence of that narrow streame, and carryed towarde the Thames with such a violent swiftnesse, as no man could rescue or stay him, till he came against a cart whéele, that stood in the water gate, before which time he was drowned, and starke dead.
               This was sometime a large water gate, frequented of shippes and other vessels, like as the Quéene Hith, and was a part thereof, as doth appeare by an Inquisition made in the 28. yeare of Henry the third, wherein was founde, that aswell corne as fish and all other things comming to the Port of Downe gate, were to bee ordered after the customes of the Quéenes Hith, for the kings vse, as also that the corne arriuing betwéene the gate of the Guildhall of the Marchants of Cullen: the (Styleyarde) which is East from Downe gate, and the house then pertayning to the Archbishoppe of Canterbury, West from Baynards castle, was to be measured by the measure and measurer of the Quéenes soke, or Quéene Hith.Marchants of the Haunce, landed their corne betwixt their house, & the Black friers I reade also in the 19. of Edward the thirde, that customes were then to be payde for shippes and other vessels resting at Downe gate, as if they roade at Quéene Hith, and as they now doe a Belingsgate. And thus much for Downe gate may suffice.
               The next after Downgate (of old time) was called Wolses gate

               Then is there a water gate at the Bridge foote, called Oyster gate,Oystergate of Dysters that were there of old time commonly to be sold, and was the chiefest market for them, and for other shell fishes  There standeth now an engine, or forcier, for the winding vp of ter to serue the citie, whereof I haue already spoken.
               The next is the Bridge gate,
                  Bridge gate. so called of London Bridge whereon it standeth: This is one of the foure first and principall gates of the citie, and was long before the conquest, when there stood a Bridge of timber: which Gate being weakely made, when the bridge was builded of stone, hath béene often times since repayred. This gate with the Tower vpon it, in the 1436. fell down, & two of the farthest Arches Southwards also fell therewith, and no man perished or was hurt therewith. To the repayring whereof, diuers welthy citizens gaue large summes of money, namely Robert Large, sometime Mayor, gaue to that work 100. marks, Stephen Forster 20. l. S. Iohn Crosby Alderman 100. l. &c. But in the yeare 1471.W. Dunthorne the Kentish Mariners vnder the conduct of Bastard Fauconbridge, burned the said Gate, and xiij.honses on the Bridge, besides the Béere houses at S. Katherines, and many other in the suburbes.
               The next is Buttolphes gate,Buttolphes gate. so called of the parish Church of S. Buttolph néere adioyning. This gate was sometime giuen, or confirmed by William Conqueror, to the Monkes of Westminster in these wordes: 
                     W. Rex Angliae &c. William King of England, sendeth gréeting to the Sheriffes & all his ministers, as also to all his louing subiects, French and English of London, Know ye that I haue granted to God, and S. Peter of Westminster,
& to the Abbot Vitalis, the gift which Almundus of the port of S. Buttolph gaue them, when he was there made Monke: that is to say, his Lords court with the houses, and one Wharfe, which is at the head of London bridge, and all other his landes which he had in the same citie, in such sort as King Edward more beneficially, and amply granted the same: and I will and command, that they shall inioy the same well and quietly and honourably with sake, and soke &c.
               
               The next is Belingsgate
                  Belingsgate. nowe vsed as an especiall Porte or harborow, for small shippes and boates comming thereto, and is now the largest water gate on the Riuer of Thames, and therefore most frequented, the Quéenes Hith being almost forsaken. Now this Gate tooke that name, or of what antiquity the same is,  must leaue vncertaine, as not hauing read any auncient recorde thereof, more then that Geffrey Monmouth
                  Geffrey Monmouth. writeth, that Belin a King of the Britans, about 400. yeares before Christes natiuitie builded this gate, and named it Belins gate, after his owne calling: and that when he was dead, his bodie being burned, the ashes in a vessell of brasse, were set vpon a high pinacle of stone ouer the same Gate. But Cesar, and other the Romaine writers, affirme of citties, walles, and gates, as ye haue before heard, and therefore it séemeth to me not to be so auncient, but rather to haue taken that name of some later owner of the place, happily named Belin, as Somars Key, Smarts Key, Froth wharfe, and others thereby tooke their names of their owners: of this gate more shall be saide when we come to Belins Gate warde.
               Then haue you a Water gateWatergate by the custome house. on the West side of Woolle wharfe, or Customers Key, which is now of late most beautifully enlarged and built, This gate is commonly called the Watergate, as being at the South end of Water lane.
               One other Water gate there is by the Bulwark of the Tower,Watergate by the Tower. and this is the last and farthest water gate Eastward, on the Riuer of Thames, so farre as the cittie of London extendeth within the walles: both which last named water gates bee within the Tower ward.
               Besides these common Water gates were diuers priuate wharfes and KeyesWharfes and Keyes. all along from the East to the West of this Cittie, on the banke of the Riuer of Thames: Marchants of all nations had landing places, Ware houses, sellers and stowage of their goodes and marchandises, as partly shall bee touched in the Wardes adioyning to the said Riuer, and therefore concerning Gates let this suffice.

                         London. whose turrets and walles do rise from a deep foundation, the morter thereof being tempered with the blood of beastes. In the west parte are two most  strong Castels &c. To beginne therefore with the most famous Tower of London, situate in the East, neere vnto the Riuer of Thames, it hath béene the common opinion: and some hans written (but of none assured ground) that Iulius Cesar, the first Conqueror of the Britaines, was the originall Author, and founder aswell thereof, as also of many other Towers, castles, and great buildings within this Realme: but (as I haue alreadie before noted) Cesar remayned not here so long, nor had hee in his head any such matter,In my Annals. but onely to dispatch a conquest of this barbarous countrey, and to procéede to greater matters. Neyther do the Romaine writers make mention of any such buildings erected by him here. And therefore leauing this, and procéeding to more grounded authoritie, I find in a fayre register booke, of the actes of the Bishops of Rochester, set downe by Edmond of Hadenham, that William the first (surnamed Conquerour) builded the Tower of London,

Recompence was often promised, but neuer performed, vntill King Edward comming after, gaue to the brethren fiue markes and a half for that part which the ditch had deuoured: and the other part thereof without, he yeelded to them againe, which they hold: and of the said rent of fiue markes and a halfe they haue a déed, by vertue whereof, they are well paid vntill this day.

               In the yeare 1344. King Edward the third commaunded Florences of gold to be made and coyned in the Tower, that is to say, a penie péece of the value of sixe shillinges and eyght pence, the half penie piece, of the value of iij.

                   whereof I haue read, & also the first coyning of Gold in England: for (that I may a little digresse by occasion hereof) I find that in times before passed,Argent, and Pecunia after called Estarling. all great sommes were paid by wayght of gold or siluer, as so many pounds or marks of siluer, or so many pounds or markes of Gold, as I could proue by many good authorities, which I ouerpasse. The smaller sommes also were paide in starlings, which were pence, so called, for other coynes they had none. The antiquitie of this starling penie vsuall in his Realme, is from the raign of Henry the second: notwithstanding, the Saxon coines before the conquest were pence of fine siluer full the weight, and somewhat better then the latter starlings, as I haue tryed by conference of the pence of Burghrede king of Mercia, Aelfred, Edward, and Edelrod, kings of the West Sexons, Plegmond Archbishop of Canterburie, and others. William the ConqueroursW. Conqueror Weare no beardes. W. Malmsbery
                   penie also was fine siluer of the weight of the Easterling, and had on the one side stamped an armed heade, with a beardles face, (for the Normans did weare no beardes) with a scepter in his hand: the inscription in the circumference was this, Le Rei Wilā
                   on the other side a Crosse double to the ring, betwéene foure rowals of sixe pointes.
               King Henrie the first his pennie was of the like weight, finenes, forme of face, crosse &c.
               This Henrie in the eight year of his raigne, ordayned the peny which was round, so to bee quartered, by the crosse, that they might easily bee broken,Roger Houeden. into halfe pence and farthinges. In the first, second, thirde, fourth, and fift of king Richard the first his raigne, and afterwardes I find commonly Esterling mony mentioned, and yet oft times the same is called argent as afore, and not otherwise.
               The first great summe that I read of to be paid in Esterlinges, was in the fift of Richard the first, when Robert Earle of Leycester being prisoner in France, proffered for his ransome a thousand markes Esterlinges, notwithstanding the Esterling pence were long before. The weight of the Esterling pennieVVeight of starling penie 32. graines of Wheate. may appeare by diuers statutes, namely of weights and measures, made in the 51. of Henry the third in these words. Thirtie two graines of Wheat, drie and round, taken in the midst of the eare, should  be the weight of a starling penie, 20. of those pence shoulde waye one ounce, 12. ownces a pound Troy, It followeth in the statute eight pound to make a gallon of Wine, and eight gallons a bushell of London measure; &c. Notwithstanding which Statute, I find in the eight of Edward the first, Gregorie Rokefley Mayor of London, being thiefe Maister or minister of the kinges Exchaunge, or mintes, a new coyne being then appointed, the pound of Esterling money should contayne as afore 12. ownces, to wit, fine siluer, such as was then made into foyle, and was commonly called siluer of Guthurons lane, 11. ounces, two Estarlings, and one ferling or farthing, and the other 17. pence ob. q. to bee lay. Also the pound of money ought to weygh xx.

               Now for the pennie Esterling how it tooke that name, I think good briefly to touch.The penie Esterling how i
                        •
                      tooke the name. It hath béene said that Numa Pompilius the second King of the Romaines commanded money first to bee made, of whose name they were called Numi, and when Copper pence, siluer pence, and gold pence were made, because euery siluer pennie was worth ten Copper pence, and euery Gold pennie worth ten siluer pence, the pence therefore were called in Latine Denarij, and oftentimes the pence are named of the matter and stuffe of Gold or siluer. But the money of England was called of the workers and makers thereof: as the Floren of gold is called of the Florentines, that were the workers thereof: and so the Esterling pence tooke their name of the Esterlinges, which did first make this mony in England in the raign of Henry the second.
               Thus haue I set downe according to my small reading in antiquitie: these money matters, omitting the imaginations of late writers, of whom some haue saide Esterling money to take that name of a starre, stamped in the border, or ring of the pennie: other some of a birde called a Stare or starlingStarling money when it tooke beginning in this land. stamped in the circumference: and other (more vnlikely) of being coyned at Siriuelin 
                   or Starling, a towne in Scotland. &c.
               Now concerning halfe pence, and Farthinges,Of halfepence ond farthings. the account of which is more subtiller then the pence, I neede not speake of them more, then that they were onely made in the Exchange at London,
 and no where else. The kinges Exchaunge at London,

Aboute the same time also, the olde coine of golde,Coines of gold enhaunced. was changed into a new, but the old noble (then so called) was worth much aboue the taxed rate of the new, and therefore the Marchantes iugrossed vp the olde, and conueyed them out of the Realme to the greate losse of the kingdome. Wherefore a remedy was prouided by chaunging of the stampe.

               In the yeare 1387. king Richard
                  Richard the 2. prisoner in the Tower. held his feast of Christmas in the Tower. And in the yeare 1399. the same king was sent prisoner to the Tower.
               In the yeare 1414. Sir Iohn Oldecastle brake out of the Tower. And the same yeare a Parliament being holden at Leicester, a Porter of the Tower was drawn, hanged and headed, whose heade was sent vp, and set ouer the Tower gate, for consenting to one Whitlooke, that brake out of the Towre.
               In the yeare 1419. Fryer Randulph was sent to the Tower, and was there slaine by the Parson of S. Peters in the Tower.
               In the yeare 1465. king Henry the 6. was brought prisoner  to the Tower, where he remained long. In the yeare, 1470. the Tower was yeelded to the Maior of London, and his Brethren the Aldermen, who forthwith entered the same, and deliuered king Henry, but the next yeare hee was againe sent thether, and there murthered.
               In the yeare, 1478. George Duke of Clarence was drowned in the Tower: and within 5. yeares after king Edwarde the 5. with his brother were murdered in the Tower.King Henry the 6. murdred in the Tower

               Thus much for these accidentes: and now to conclude thereof in summarie. This TowerVse of the Tower. is a citadell, to defend or commande the Citie: A royall palace for assemblies, and treaties. A prison of Estate, for the most daungerous offendors: The onely place of coinage for all Englande at this present. The Armorie for warlike prouision.

               The next Tower on the riuer of Thames, is on London bridge at the North ende of the draw bridge.Tower at the north end of the draw bridg This Tower was new begun to be builded in the yeare, 1426. Iohn Reynwell Maior of London, laide one of the first corner stones, in the foundation of this worke, the other three were laide by the Shiriffes, and Bridgemaisters, vpon euery of these foure stones was engrauen in fayre Romaine letters, the name of Ihesus. And these stones, I haue seene laide in the Bridge store house, since they were taken vp, when that Tower was of late newly made of timber. This gate and Tower was at the first stronglie builded vp of stone, and so continued vntill the yere 1577. in the Moneth of Aprill, when the same stone Arched gate, and Tower being decayed was begunne to bee taken downe, and then were the heads of the Traytors remoued thence, and set on the Tower ouer the gate at the bridge foote, towardes Southwarke. This saide Tower  being taken downe a new foundation was drawne: and Sir Iohn Langley Lord Maior layed the first stone in the presence of the Shiriffes, and Bridge maisters, on the 28. of August, and in the Moneth of September, the yeare 1579. the same Tower was finished a beutiful and chargeable peece of worke, all aboue the bridge being of timber.
               An other Towre there is on London bridge, to wit, ouer the gate at the South ende of the same bridgeTower at the south ende of the bridge. towardes Southwarke. This gate with the Tower thereupon, and two Arches of the Bridge fell downe, and no man perished by the fall thereof in the yere, 1436.The south gate on London bridge burned Towards the new building whereof, diuers, charitable Citizens gaue large summes of money: which gate being then again new builded, was in the yere 1471. burned by the Marriners and Saylors of Kent, Bastarde Fauconbridge, being theyr Captaine.
               In the west part of this citie, (saith Fitzstephen) are two most strong castels &c. Also Garuasius Tilbery, in the raigne of Henry the second, writing of these castles, hath to this effect. Two Castles (saith hee, are built with walles and rampires, wherof one, is in right of succession, Baynardes:
                  Baynardes Castle. Fitzstephen. Garua. Tilbery
                   the other the Barons of Mountfitchet: the first of these castles bankying on the riuer Thames, was called Baynardes Castle, of Baynarde, a noble man that came in with the Conqueror, and then builded it and deceased in the yeare of the raigne of William Rufus: after whose decease Geffery Baynarde succeeded, and then William Baynarde, in the yeare 1111. who by forfeyture for felony, lost his Barony, of little Dunmow and king Henry gaue if wholy to Robart Fitz Richard the Sonne of Gilbarte Earle of Clare, and to his heires together with the honor of Baynardes castell. This Robart married Maude de Sent Licio, Lady of Bradham and deceased 1134. was buried at S. Nedes, by Richarde Earle of Clare, his Father. VValter, his sonne succeeded him, hee tooke to wife, Matilde de Becham, and after her decease Matilde de Lucy, on whome he begat Robarte and other, hee deceased in the yeare 1198. and was buried at Dunmow after whome succeeded Robart Fitzwater a valiant knight.
               Aboute the yeare 1213. there arose a greate discorde betwixt king Iohn, and his Barons, because of Matilde,

The Barons were receiued into London, where they greatly indamaged the king, but in the end the king did not onely, (therefore) bannish the said Fitzwater
                  Robert Fitzwater banished. (amongst other), out of the Realme: but also caused his Castle called Baynarde,
                  Baynardes castle destroyed. and other his houses to be spoiled, which thing being done Matilde, the fayre, a Messenger being sent vnto her,Virginity defended with the losse of worldly goods and life of the bodie, for life of the soule aboute the kinges suite, whereunto shee would not consent, was poisoned. Robert Fitzwater, and some other being then passed into France, and some other into Scotland. &c.
               It happened in the yere 1214. king Iohn being then in France with a greate Armie, that a truce was taken beewixt the two kinges of England and France, for the terme of 5. yeares, and a riuer or arme of the sea being then betwixt eyther Host. There was a knight in the English host, that cried to them of the other side, willing some one of their knightes to come and iust a course or twaine with him, whereupon without stay Robert Fitzwater being on the French parte, made himselfe readie, ferried ouer, and got on horsebacke, without any man to helpe him, and shewed himselfe ready to the face of his challenger, whome at the first course, he stroake so harde with his greate Speare, that horse and man fell to the grounde, and when his speare was broken, hee went backe againe to the king of France, which when the king
King Iohns oath. had seene, by Gods tooth (quoth hee) after his vsuall oath, hee were a king indeede, that had such a knight: the frendes of Robert hearing these words, kneeled downe and saide: O King hee is your knight: it is Robert Fitzwater,
                  Robert Fitzwater restored to the kings fauour. and thereupon the next day he was sent for, and restored to the kinges, fauour: by which meanes peace was concluded, and he receiued his liuinges, and had licence to repayre his Castle of Baynarde
                  Baynardes castle againe builded. and other Castles.
               This Robert deceased in the yeare 1234. and was buried at Dunmow, and VValter his sonne that succeeded him 1258. his Barony of Baynarde, was in the warde of king Henry in the nonage of Robert Fitzwater. This Robert tooke to his second wife Alienor, daughter to the Earle of Ferrars, in the  yeare, 1289. And in the yeare 1303. before Iohn Blund Maior of London, hee acknowledged his seruice to the same Citie for his Castle Baynarde, hee deceased in the yere 1305. and leauing issue Walter Fitz Robert, who had issue Robert Fitzwater

More of the Lord Fitzwaters may ye read in my summary and Annales in the 51. of Edward the 3.. But now how this honor of Baynardes Castle with the appurtenances fell from the possession of the Lords Fitzwaters, I haue not read, onely I finde that Humphrey Duke of Glocester,
                  Humphrey Duke of Glocester new budded Baynardes Castle. Richard Duke of Yorke, honor of Baynardes Castle. Richarde of Glocester in Baynardes Castle tooke on him the Crowne. builded it of new, by whose death in the yeare of Christ, 1446. it came to the hands of king Henry the sixt, and from him to Richarde Duke of Yorke, of whome we reade, that in the yeare 1457 hee lodged there, as in his own house: and true it is, that his sonne king Edwarde the fourth being dead, and leauing his eldest sonne Edward and his second sonne Richarde, both infantes: there Richarde Duke of Glocester, then Protector, practised for the Crowne, and as it were by election of the Commons, made in the Guild hall of London, tooke vpon him there the title of the Realme, as offered and imposed vpon him: as yee may reade set downe and penned, by Sir Thomas Moore. King Henry the 7. aboute the yeare 1501. the 3. of his raigne, repayred or rather new builded this house not so imbattelled, or so strongly fortified castlelike, but far more beutifull and commodious, for the entertainment of any Prince or greate estate. In the 7. of his raigne hee with his Queene were lodged there, and came from thence to Paules, where they made their offering: dined in the Bishops Palace, and so returned.King Henry the first was lodged in Baynardes Castle. The eighttenth of his raigne hee was lodged there and the Ambassadors from the king of Romaines were thither bronght to his presence, and from thence the King came to Pawles and was ther sworne vnto the king of Romaines, as the king had sworne vnto him. This Castle now belongeth to the Earle of Pembrooke. The next Tower, or Castle bankyng also on the Riuer of Thames, was, as is afore shewed, called Mountfiquites Castle,
                  Tower of Montfiquit. of a noble man, Baron of Mountfitcher the first builder thereof who came in with VVilliam the Conqueror and was surnamed Le Sir Mountfiquit. This Castle hee  builded in a place not far distant from Baynardes, towardes the West. The same William Mountfiquit liued in the Raigne of Henry the 1. and was witnes to a Charter, then granted to the citie for the Shiriffes of London. Richard Montfiquit liued in king Iohns time: and in the yere 1213. was by the same king banished the Realme into France, when peraduenture king Iohn caused his Castle of Montfiquit, amongst other Castles of the Barons to bee ouerthrowne: the which after his returne, might be by him againe reedified, for the totall destruction thereof was aboute the yeare 1276. when Robert Kiliwarble, Archbishop of Canterbury beganne the foundation of the house of the Friars Preachers church there, commonly called the Black Friers as appeareth by a Charter, the 10. of Iune, the 4, of Edwarde the 1. remayning of Recorde in the Tower, wherein is declared that Gregory de Rocksley Maior of London, and the BaronsBarons of London. of the same Citie granted, and gaue vnto the saide Archbishoppe Robert two lanes or waies next the streete of Baynardes castle and the Tower of Montfiquit, to be applied for the enlargement of the saide Church and place.
               A third Tower there was also situate on the riuer of Thames
                  Tower in the Thames. neare vnto the saide Blacke Friers Church, on the west parte thereof, builded at the Citizens charges, but by licence and commandement of Edwarde the 1. and of Edwarde the 2. as appeareth by their grantes: which Tower was then finished and so stoode for the space of 300. yeares, and was at the last taken downe by the commandement of Iohn Sha Maior of London in the yeare 1502.
               An other Tower or CastleTower or Castle on the west of Londō by S. Brides Church. also was there in the west parte of the Citie, perteyning to the king: For I reade that in the yere 1087. the 20. of VVilliam the first, the Citie of London with the Church of S. Paule. being burned, Mauritius then Bishop of London afterwarde began the foundation of a new Church, whereunto king VVilliam (saith mine Author) gaue the choice stones of this Castle standing neare to the banke of the riuer of Thames, at the west ende of the Citie. After this Mauritius, Richarde his successor, purchased the streetes aboue Paules church compassing the same with a wall of stone, and gates.

Brides in London, where hee exacted of the Clergie and religious persons the summe of 100000. poundes, & besides all this, the white Monkes were compelled to cancell their Priuiledges, and to pay 40000. poundes to the king, &c. This house of S. Brides of latter time being left, and not vsed by the kinges: fell to ruine, insomuch that the verie platforme thereof remayned for greate parte wast, and as it were, but a laystall of filth and rubbish: onely a fayre well remained there: a greate part whereof, namely on the west, (as hath beene said) was giuen to the Bishop of Salisbnry, the other parte towardes the East remayning wast, vntill that king Henry the 8. builded a stately and beutifull house thereupon, giuing it to name Bridewell,

               On the northwest side of this Citie, neare vnto Redcrosse  streete there was a Tower commonlie called Barbican, or Burhkenning,
                  Barbican or Burhkenning. for that the same being placed on a high ground, and also builded of some good height, was in the olde time vsed as a Watch Tower, for the Citie, from whence a man might behold and view the whole Citie towards the South, as also sée into Kent, Sussex, and Surrey, and likewise euery other way east, north, or west.
               Some other Burhkennings or (Watch Towers) there were of olde time in and aboute the citie, all which were repayred, yea and others new builded, by Gilbart de Clare earle of Glocester, in the raigne of king Henry, the third, when the Barons were in Armes, and held the citie against the k

               IN the raigne of king Stephen, and of Henry the second saith Fitzstephen, there were in London, thrée principall Churches: which had famous Schooles,Famous Schooles of philosophie by priuiledge in London. either by priuiledge and auncient dignitie, or by fauour of some particular persons, as of Doctors which were accounted notable and renowned for knowledge in Philosophie. And there were other inferior Schooles also. Upon Festiuall daies the Maisters made solemne meetingesSolemne meetinges and disputing of schollers Logically and Demonstratiuely. in the Churches, where their Schollers disputed Logically and demonstratiuely, as he termeth it: some bringing Enthimems, other perfect Sillogismes, some disputed for shew, others to trace out the truth: cunning Sophisters were thought braue Schollers, when they flowed with wordes: Others vsed Fallaxes: Rethoritians spake aptly to perswade, obseruing the precepts of arte, and omitting nothing that might serue their purpose: the bo

                  Cambridge, the frequenting of Schooles and exercises of Schollers in the Citie as had beene accustomed hath much decreased.
               The three principall Churches, which had these famous Schooles by priuiledges must needes be at the Cathedrall Church of S. Paule for one, seeing that by a generall Councell holden in the yeare of Christ, 1.176. at Rome, in the Patriarchie of Latarane,Mathew Paris it was decreede that euery Cathedrall Church should haue his Schoolemaister to teach poore Schollerseuery cathedral Church had his schoole for poore schollers and others as had beene accustomed, and that no man shoulde take any reward for licence to teach. The second as most ancient may seeme to haue been the Monasterie of S. Peter at VVestminster, whereof Iugulphus

And writing in praise of Queene Edgitha, wife to Edwarde the Confessor, I haue seene her, saith hee, often when being but a boy, I came to see my father dwelling in the Kinges courte, and often comming from Schoole, when I met her, she would oppose me, touching my learning, and lesson, & falling from Grammar to Logicke, wherein she had some knowledge, she would subtilly conclude an argument with mee, and by her handemaiden giue me 3. or 4. peeces of money, and send me vnto the Palace where I should receiue some victuals, and then be dismissed.
               
               The third Schoole seemeth to haue beene at the Monasterie of S. Sauiour at Barmondsey in Southwark: for other Priories, as of S. Iohn by Smithfielde, S. Bartlemew, in Smithfielde. S.

Logically &c. whereof I haue before spoken, the same was long since discontinued: But the arguing of the Schoole boyes aboute 
                     •
                  th principles of Grammar, hath beene continued euen till our time: for I my selfe in my youth haue yearelie  seene on the Eue of S. Bartlemew the Apostle, the schollers of diuers Grammar schooles repaire vnto the Churchyard of S. Bartlemew, the Priorie in Smithfielde, where vpon a banke boorded aboute vnder a Tree, some one Scholler hath stepped vp, and there hath appoased and answered, till he were by some better Scholler ouercome and put down: and then the ouercomer, taking the place, did like as the first: and in the end the best apposars and answerers had rewards, which I obserued not, but it made both good Schoolemasters, and also good Schollers, diligently against suchtimes to prepare themselues for the obtayning of this garland. I remember there repayred to these exercises amongst others the Maisters & Schollers of the free Schooles of S. Paules in London: of S. Peters at Westminster: of S. Thomas Acons Hospitall: and of S. Anthonies Hospitall: whereof the last named commonly presented the best schollers: and had the prize in those daies.
               This Priorie of S. Bartlemew, being surrendred to H. the 8. those disputations of Schollers in that place succeased.Disputation of Schollers in Christes Hospitall. And was again (onely for a yere or twaine) in the raigne of Edward the 6. reuiued in the Cloystre of Christes Hospitall, where the best Schollers then stil of S. Anthonies schoole, howsoeuer the same be now fallen, both in number and estimation, were rewarded with bowes and arrowes of siluer giuen to them by Sir Martin Bowes Goldsmith: neuerthelesse howsoeuer the encouragement fayled, the children mindfull of the former vsage did for a long season disorderly in the open streetes, prouoke one an other with salue tu quoque, placet tibi mecum disputare, placet: and so proceeding from this to questions in Grammar, they vsually fel from that to blowes, many times in so great heapes that they trobled the streets, & passengers, so that finally they wer restrained.
               Of latter time, in the yeare of Christ, 1582. there was founded a publike lecture in Chirurgerie to bee reade in the Colledge of Phisitions,Lecture in Chirurgery in Knight-riders streete, and to begin in the yeare 1584. on the 6. of May: and so to be continued for euer twice in euery weeke, on wednesday and Friday, by the honorable Baron, Iohn Lorde Lombley and the learned Richarde Caldwell Doctor in Phisicke: the Reader whereof to bee Richarde Forster, Doctor of Phisicke during his life. Furthermore  about the same time there was also begunne a Mathematicall lecture to be read in a fayre olde Chappell,Mathematicall lecture read. builded by Simon Eayre, within the Leaden hall: wherof a learned Citizen borne, named Thomas Hood was the first Reader. But this Chappell and other parts of that hall being imployed for stowage of goodes taken out of a great Spanish Caracke, the said Lecturs ceased any more to be read, and was then in the yeare 1588. read in the house of M.

                  One other Inne of Chauncery sometime there was, called Chesters Inne,
                  Chesters Inne or strand Inne for the néerenes to the Bishop of Chesters house, but more commonly tearmed Strand Inne, for that it stoode néere to the Strand bridge without temple Barre: the which and other dwelling houses néere adioyning, were pulled downe in the raigne of king Edward the sixt, by Edward Duke of Sommerset and Protector of the realme, who in place thereof raised that beautifull (but yet vnperfect house) called Sommerset house. There was moreouer in the raigne of King Henrie the sixt, a tenth house of Chauncerie, mentioned by Iustice Fortscue in his booke of the Lawes of England, but where it stood or when it was abandoned I cannot finde, and therefore I will leaue it, and returne to the rest.
               The houses of CourtHouses of Court what they be. bee replenished partly with young studentes, and partly with graduates and practisers of the law: but the Innes of Chauncery being as it were, prouinces, seuerally subiected to the Innes of Court, be chiefly furnished with Officers Atturneyes, Soliciters, and clarkes, that follow the courtes of the Kings Bench, or common place: and yet there want not some other being young students, that come thether sometimes from one of the vniuersities, and sometimes immediatly from Grammer schools, and these hauing spent some time in studying vpon the first elements and grounds of the lawe, and hauing performed the exercises of their owne houses (called Boltas Mootes, and putting of cases) they procéed to be admitted, and become students in some of these foure houses or Innes of Court, where continuing by the space of seuen yeares (or thereaboutes) they frequent readinges, méetinges, boltinges, and other learned exercises, whereby growing ripe in the knowledge of the lawes, and approued withall to be of honest conuersation, they are eyther by the generall consent of the Benchers (or Readers) being of the most auncient, graue, and iudiciall men of euery Inne of the Court, or by the special priuiledge of the present reader there, selected and called to the degrée of Vtter Barresters, and so enabled to bee common counsellers, & to practise the lawe, both in their chambers and at the Barres.
               Of these after that they be called to a further steppe of preferment, (called the Bench) there are twaine euery yeare chosen among  the Benchers, of euery Inne of Court, to be readers there, who do make their readings at two times in the yeare also: that is, one in Lent, and the other at the beginning of August.
               And for the helpe of young students in euery of the Innes of Chauncery, they do likewise choose out of euery one Inne of court a Reader (being no Bencher) but an Vtter Barrester there, of 10 or 12. yeares continuance, and of good profite in studie. Nowe from these of the said degrée of Councellors (or Vtter Barrester) hauing continued therein the space of fourtéene or fiftéene yeares at the least, the chiefest and best learned, are by the benchers elected to increase the number (as I said) of the Bench amongst them, and so in their time doe become first single, and then double readers, to the students of those houses of Court: after which last reading they be named Apprentices at the lawe,Apprentizes at the law. and in default of a sufficient number of Sargeantes at law, these are (at the pleasure of the prince) to be aduaunced to the places of Sergeants: out of which number of Sergeants also the void places of Iudges are likewise ordinarily filled, albeit now and then some be aduanced by the speciall fauour of the Prince, to the estate, dignitie and place, both of Sergeant and Iudge, as it were in one instant. But from thenceforth they hold not any roome in those Innes of court, being translated to one of the said two Innes, called Sergeantes Innes, where none but the Sergeants and Iudges do conuere.
            
            
               Of Orders & Customes.
               
                  OF Orders and Customes in this Citie of old time Fitz Stephen saith as followeth: Men of all trades,Men of all trades in distinct places. Wine in ships and wine in Tauern
                        •
                     s. Cookes row in Thamestreet. sellers of all sortes of wares, labourers in euerie worke, euerie morning are in their distinct and seuerall places: furthermore, in London vppon the riuer side, betweene the wine in shippes, and the wine to bee solde in Tauernes, is a common cookerie or cookes rowe, there dayly for the season of the yeare, men might haue meate, rost, sod or fried: fish, flesh, fowles, fit for rich and poore. If any come sodainely to  any Cittizen from a farre, wearie and not willing to tarry till the meate be bought, and dressed, while the seruant bringeth water for his maysters handes, and fetcheth bread, hee shall haue immediately from the riuers side, all viandes whatsoeuer he desireth, what multitude soeuer eyther of soldiers or straungers doe come to the Citie, whatsoeuer houre day or night according to their pleasures may refresh themselues, & they which delight in delicatenesse may bee satisfied with as delicate dishes there, as may be found els where. And this cookes rowe is very necessarie to the Citie: and (according to Plato in Gorgias) next to Phisicke, is the office of cookes, as part of a Citie.
               Without one of the gates is a plain field,Smithfield for a plain smooth ground, is called smeth and smothie. both in name and deede, where euery fryday (vnlesse it bee a solemne bidden holy day) is a notable shew of horses to bee sold, Earles, Barrons, Knights, and Citizens repayre thether to see, or to buy: there may you with pleasure see amblers pacing it delicately: there may ye see trotters fit for men of armes, sitting more hardly:Market for horses and other cattell. ther may you haue notable young horse not yet brokē: there may you haue strong steeds wel limmed, geldings whom the buyers do especially regarde for pace, and swiftnes: the boyes which ride these horses, sometime two, sometime three, doe runne races for wagers, with a desire of praise, or hope of victorie. In an other part of that field are to be sold all implements of husbandrie, as also fat swine, milch kine, sheepe and oxen: there stand also mares and horses, fitte for ploughes and teames with their young coltes by them. At this citieMarchants of all nations traded at this City, & had their seuerall Keyes and wharfes. Marchante strangers of all nations had their keyes and wharfes:The Authors opinion of this Citie, the antiquitie thereof after some authors which he had reade. the Arabians sent gold: the Sabians spice and frankensence: the Scithian armour, Babilon oile, Indian purple garments, Egipt precious stones, Norway and Russia Ambergrese, & Sables, & the French men wine. According to the truth of Chronicles, this Citie is ancienter then Rome,This Citie deuided into Wardes more then 400 years since, and also had then both Aldermen and Sheriffes. built of the auncient Troians and of Brute, before that was built by Romulus, and Rhemus: and therefore vseth the auncient customes of Rome. This Citie euen as Rome, is diuided into Wardes: it hath yearely Shiriffes in steed of Consulles:  it hath the dignitie of Senators in Aldermen. It hath vnder Officers, Common Sewers, and Conduictes in streetes, according to the qualitie of causes, in hath generall Courtes: and assemblies vpon appointed dayes. I doe not thinke that there is any Cittie, wherein are better customes,Customes of London. in frequenting the Churches, in seruing God, in keeping holy dayes, in giuing almes, in entertayning straungers in solemnizing Marriages, in furnishing banquets, celebrating funerals, and burying dead bodies.
               The onely plagues of London, is immoderate quassing among the foolish sort, and often casualties by fire.Casualtie of fires when houses were couered with thatch. Most part of the Bishops, Abbots, and great Lordes of the land haue houses there, whereunto they resort, and bestow much when they are called to Parliament by the king, or to counsell by their Metropolitane, or otherwise by their priuate businesse.
               Thus far Fitzstephen of the estate of these things in his time, whereunto may be added the present, by conference whereof, the alteration will easily appeare.
               Men of trades and sellers of wares in this City haue often times since chaunged their places, as they haue found their best aduantage. For whereas Mercers and Haberdashers vsed to kéepe their shoppes in West Cheape, of later time they held them on London Bridg, where partly they yet remayne. The Goldsmithes of Gutherons lane, and old Exchaunge, are now for the most part remoued into the South side of west Cheap: the Peperers and Grocers of Sopers lane, are now in Buckles berrie, & other places: the Drapers of Lombardstréete and of Cornehill, are seated in Candlewickstréete and Watheling streete: the Skinners from S. Mary Pellipers, or at the Axe, into Budgerow and Walbrooke: The StockefishmongersStockfishmonger row, old fishstreet, and new fishstreet. in Thames stréete: wette Fishmongers in Knightriders stréete, and Bridge stréete: The Ironmongers of Ironmongers lane, and old Iury, into Thames stréete: the Uinteners from the Uinetrée into diuers places. But the Brewers for the more parte remaine néere to the friendly water of Thames: the Butchers in Eastcheape, and S. Nicholas Shambles: the Hosyers of olde time in Hosyer lane, neare vnto Smithfield, are since remoued into Cordwayner  stréete, the vpper part thereof by Bow Church, and last of all into Birchouerislane by Cornehill: the Sh
                     •
                  omakers and Curryars of Cordwaynerstreete, remoued the one to S. Martins Le Graund, the other to London wall neare vnto Moregate, the Founders remayne by them selues in Lothebery: Cokes, or Pastelars for the more part in Thames street, the other dispersed into diuers parts. Powlters of late remoued out of the Powltry betwixt the Stockes and great Conduite in Cheape into Grassestreete and S. Nicholas Shambles: Bowyars, from Bowyer
                  rowe by Ludgate, into diuers places, and almost worne out with the Fletchers: Pater noster Beade makers and Text Writers are gone out of Pater Noster Rowe into Stationers of Paules Church yard: Patten makers of S. Margaret Pattens lane, cleane worne out: Laborers euery worke daye are to bee found in Cheape about Sopars lane ende, horse coursers and Sellars of Oxen, Sheepe, Swine, and such like, remaine in their olde market of Smithfilde &c.
               That Marchants of all Nations had their Keyes and wharfes at this City whereunto they brought their Marchandises before, and in the raigne, of Henry the second mine author wrote of his owne knowledge to be true, though for the antiquitie of the citie, he tooke the common opinion. Also that this citie was in his time and afore deuided into wards, had yearly Sherifs, Aldermen, general courts, and assemblies, & such like notes by him set down, in commendation of the cittizens (whereof there is no question) hee wrote likewise of his owne experience, as being borne & brought vp amongst them.Thomas Clifford.
               
               And concerning Marchandises then thither transported (wherof happily may bee some argument) Thomas Clifforde (before Fitz Stephens time) writing of Edward the Confessor, saith to this effect: King Edward intending to make his Sepulcher at Westminster, for that it was neere to the famous citie of London and the Riuer of Thames, that brought in all kinde of Marchandises, from all parts of the world &c. And William of Malmsberie,
                  William Malmsbery. that liued in the raygne of William the first and seconde, Henry the first, and king Stephen, calleth this a noble Citie, full of wealthie cittizens, frequented with the trade of Marchandises  from all parts of the world. Also I reade in diuers records that of olde time no woade was stowed or harbored in this Citty but all was presently solde in the ships, except by licence purchased of the Sheriffes, till of more latter time, to wit, in the yeare 1236. Andrew Bokereil being Mayor, by assent of the principall Citizens, the Marchants of Amiens, Nele and Corby, purchased letters insealed with the common seale of the Cittie, that they when they come, might harborow their woades, and therefore should giue the Mayor euery yeare 50. markes starling: and the same yeare they gaue 100. 
                     •
                   towards the conueying of water from Tyborne to this Citie. Also the Marchants of Normandie made fine for licence to harbor their woads, till it was otherwise prouided. In the yeare 1263. Thomas Fitz Thomas, being Mayor, &c. which proueth that then (as afore) they were here, amongst other nations priuiledged.
               It followeth in Fitz Stephen, that the plagues of London in that time were immoderate quaffing among fooles, and often casualties by fire. For the first, to wit of quaffing, it continueth as afore, though greatly qualified among the poorer sort not of any holy abstinencie, but of méer necessitie, Ale and Béere being small, and wines in price aboue their reach. As for preuention of casualties by fire (the houses in this citie being then builded all of timber and couered with thatch of straw or réed) it was long since, thought good policie in our forefathers, wisely to prouide, namely in the yeare of Christ 1189.Li.

& exhibited a booke (as I heare) to the Mayor and communaltie.
               Then the number of Carres, Drayes, and Coatches, more then hath beene accustomed, the streetes and lanes being strengthned,  must needes be daungerous, as dayly experience proueth. I know that by the good lawes and customes of this cittie, shodde cartes are forbidden to enter, except vpon reasonable causes, (as seruice of the Prince, or such like) they be tollerated. Also that the forehorse of euery cariage should bee lead by hande: but these good orders are not obserued. Of old time coatches were not knowne in this Island, but chariots, or Whirlicotes, and they onely vsed of Princes or great estates, such as had their footmen about them: I reade that Rychard the second being threatened by the rebelles of Kent, rode from the Tower of London to the Myles end,L.S. Mary Aborum. and with him his mother in a Wherlicote,Riding in Wherlicotes. the Earls of Buckingham, Kent, Warwicke, and Oxford, Sir Thomas Perie, Sir Robert Knowles, the Mayor of London, Sir Auberie de Vere, that bare the Kinges sword, with other Knightes and Esquires attending on horsebacke. But in the yeare next following the said King Richard tooke to wife Anne daughter to the King of Boheme, that first brought hither the riding vpon side saddles,Riding in side saddles, that were wont to ride a stride. Riding in Coaches. and so was the riding in Wherlicoates and chariots forsaken, except at coronations and such like spectacles: but now of late yeares the vse of coatches is taken vp, and made so common, as there is neyther distinction of time, nor difference of persons obserued.
               Last of all mine Author in this Chapter hath these words: Most part of the Bishops,
                  W. Fitz Stephen. 
                  Abbots, and great Lordes of the land, as if they were Citizens & free men of London, had many fayre houses to resort vnto, and many rich and wealthy gentlemen spent their money there. And in an other place hee hath these words: Euery Sonday in Lent a fresh company of young men comes into the fields on horsebacke, and the best horsemen conducteth the rest: then martch forth the Citizens sonnes, and other young men with disarmed launces and shieldes, & practise feates of warre: many Courtiers likewise and attendants of noble men repaire to this exercise, & whilst the hope of victorie doth enflame their mindes, they doe shewe good proofe how seruiceable they would be in martial affaires &c. Againe he saith: This Citie in the troublesome time of King Stephen shewed at a muster 20000. armed horsemen, and 40000. footemen, seruiceable for the warres. &c. All which  sayinges of the said Author well considered, do plainely proue, that in those dayes, the inhabitantes & repayrers to this Citie of what estate soeuer, spirituall or temporall, hauing houses here, liued together in good amitie, euery man obseruing the customes and order of the Citie, and chose to be contributarie to charges here, rather then in any part of the land wheresoeuer: This cittie being the hart of the Realme, the Kinges chamber, and Princes seate whereunto they made repayre, and shewed their forces, both of horses and of men, which caused in troublesome time (as of king Stephen) the Musters of this Citie to be so great in number.The causes of great shewes and musters in this citie of old time, more then of late.
               
               And here to touch somewhat of the great families and housholds kept in former times I reade that in the 36. of Henry the sixt, the great estates being called vp to London, the Earle of Salesbury came with 500. men on horsebacke, and was lodged in the Herber: Richard Duke of Yorke with 400. men lodged at Baynards Castle: the Dukes of Excester, and Sommerset with 800. men. The Earle of Northumberland, the Lord Egremonte, and the Lord Clifford with 1500. men. Richard Neuell EarleNeuill Earle of Warwicke. R. Fabian manuscript.

                  Earle of Darby is not to be forgotten who had 220. men in Checke Rolle: his féeding aged persons, twice euery day sixtie and odde, besides all commers thrice a weeke, and euery good Fryday 2700. with meate drinke and money.

VVilliam Powlet Lord great mayster, Marquis of Winchester, kept the like number of Gentlemen and yeomen in a liuery of Reding Tawney. Thomas Lord Cromwell Earle of Essex kept the like or greater number in a liuerie of gray marble, &c. the gentlemen garded with Ueluet, and the yeomens with the same cloth.
               These, as all other of those times gaue great reliefe to the poore, and I haue oft séene at that Lorde Cromwels gate, more then two hundred persons serued twice euery day with breade, meate, and drinke.
               
                  Edward Duke of Sommerset
                  Edw. Duke of Sommerset. was not inferior in kéeping a number of tall Gentlemen and yeomen. These (I say) and all other men of honour and worshippe then lodging in this Citie, or within the liberties therof, did without grudging, beare their part of charges with the Citizens, according to their estimated estates, without the which, those musters of old time could not haue béene so great.
               And thus I end touching vsuall Orders and Customes of this citie.
            
            
               Sports and pastimes of old time vsed in this Citie.
               LEt vs now saith (Fitz Stephen) come to the sportes and pastimes,Of sports and pastimes in this Citie euerie thing hath his time, a time to weepe a time to laugh, a time to mourne, & a time to daunce. Eccles. 3. séeing it is fitte that a cittie should not onely be commodious and serious, but also merrie and sportfull: whereupon in the seales of the Popes, vntil the time of Pope Leo, on the one side was Saint Peter; fishing with a keye ouer him, reached as it were by the hande of God out of heauen, and about it this verse. Tu pro me nauem liquisti, 
                        •
                     uscipe clauem. And on the other side was a cittie, and this inscription on it, Aurea Roma. Likewise to the prayse of Augustus Cesar, and the citie,  in respect of the shewes and sportes was written,
               Nocte pluit tota redeunt spectacula mane, &c.
               All night it raynes, and showes at morrowtide returne again. And Cesar with almigtie Ioue hath matcht any equall raigne. But London for the shews vpon Theaters, & Comical pastimes, hath holy playes representations of miracles,Stage playes. which holy confessors haue wrought, or representations of tormentes wherein the constancie of Martirs appeared. Euery yeare also at Shrouetuseday (that we may beginne with childrens sports, séeing we al haue béene children) the schoole boyes do bring cockes of the game to their Mayster, and all the forenoone they delight themselues in cockfighting:Cock fighting. after dinner all the youthes goe into the fieldes, to play at the ball.Ball play. The schollers of euery schoole haue their ball (or bastion) in their hands: the auncient and wealthy men of the Citie come forth on horsebacke to sée the sport of the young men, and to take parte of the pleasure in beholding their agilitie. Euery Fryday in Lent a fresh company of young men comes into the fielde on horsebacke,Exercise of war like feates on horsebacke with disarmed launces. and the best horsemen conducteth the rest. Then march forth the citizens sonnes, and other young men with disarmed launces and shieldes, and there they practise feates of warre. Many Courtiers likewise when the king

                  yeth néere, and attendants of noble men do repayre to these exercises, and while the hope of victorie doth inflame their mindes, do shew good proofe how seruiceable they would bee in martiall affayres. In Easter holidaies they fight battailes on the water,Battailes on water. a shield is hanged vpon a pole, fixed in the midst of the streame, a boat is prepared without oares to be carryed by violence of the water, and in the

                  ore part thereof standeth a young man, readie to giue charge vpon the shield with his launce: if so be he breaketh his launce against the shield, and doth not fall, he is thought to haue performed a worthy déede. If so be (without breaking his launce, hee runneth strongly against the shield, downe hee falleth into the water, for the boate is violently forced with the tide, but on each side of the shielde ride two boates furnished with young men, which recouer him that falleth as soone as they may, Upon the bridge, wharfes, and houses, by the riuers side, stand great numbers to sée, and laugh thereat. In the holy dayes all sommer the youths are exercised in leaping, dancing, shooting, wrastling,Leaping, dancing, shooting wrestling, casting the stone, and practizing their  shieldes: the maydens trippe it with their Timbrelles, and daunceDauncing. as long as they can well sée. In winter euery holy day before dinner, the Boares prepared for brawne are set to fight,Fighting of Boars, bayting of Beares and Bulles. or els Bulles and Beares are bayted.
               When the great fenne or Moore (which watereth the walles of the citie on the North side) is frozen, many young men play vpon the yce,The More field when there was no ditch by the wall of the Citie slyding on the yce. some stryding as wide as they may, doe slide swiftly: others make themselues seates of ice, as great as milstones: one sits downe, many hand in hand do drawe him, and one slipping on a sudden, all fall together: some tye bones to their féete, and vnder their heeles, and shouing themselues by a little picked staffe, doe slide as swiftly as a birde flyeth in the aire, or an arrow out of a crossebow. Sometime two runne together with poles, and hitting one the other, eyther one or both doe fall, not without hurt: some break their armes, some their legs, but youth desirous of glorie, in this sort exerciseth it selfe against the time of warre: Many of the citizens do delight themselues in Haukes, and houndes,Hauking and hunting. for they haue libertie of hunting in Middlesex, Hartfordshire, all Chiltron, and in Kent to the water of Cray. Thus farre FitzStephen of sports.
               These, or the like exercises haue béene continued till our time, namely in stage playes,A Stage play continued. whereof ye may reade in Anno 1391. a play to be plaide by the parish Clearkes of London at the Skinners well besides Smithfield: which play continued thrée dayes together,A stage play that lasted eight daies. the King, Quéene, and Nobles of the realme being present. And of another, plaide in the yeare 1409. which lasted eight daies, and was of matter from the creation of the worlde, whereat was present most part of the nobilitie, and gentrie of England
&c. Of late time in place of those Stage playes, hath béene vsed Comedies, Tragedies, enterludes, and histories, both true and fayned: For the acting whereof certaine publike places, as the Theater, the Curtine,Theater and Curtine for Comedies & other shewes Cocke fight. &c. haue béene erected. Also cockes of the game are yet cherished by diuers men for their pleasures, much money being laid on their heades, when they fight in pits, whereof some be costly made for that purpose. The Ball is vsed by noble men and gentlemen in Tennis courtes,The ball at Tennis play and by people of meaner sort in the open fieldes, and stréetes. The youthes of this citie  time out of mind, haue left off to practise the disarmed launce, & shielde on horsebacke in the fieldes, but I haue séene some few vpon the Riuer of Thames rowed in boates, with staues flat at the fore

                  end, running one against another, and for the most part eyther one, or both ouerthrowne and well ducked. On the holydaies in sommer the youthes of this Citie, haue in the fields exercised themselues in leaping, dauncing, shooting, wrastling,Leaping, dancing, shooting wrestling, &c. casting of the stone or Ball &c. And for defence and vse of the weapon, there is a speciall profession of men that teach it. Yee may reade in mine Annalles, how that in the yeare 1222. the citizens kept games of defence,Games of defence. and wrestlings néere vnto the Hospitall of Saint Giles in the fielde, where they challenged, and had the masterie of the men in the suburbes, and other commers &c. Also in the yeare 1453. of a tumult made against the Mayor, at the wrestling besides Clarkes well &c. which is sufficient to proue that of olde time the exercising of wrestling, and such like hath beene much more vsed then of latter yeares. The youthes of this citie, also haue vsed on holy dayes after euening prayer, at their maysters dores, to exercise their wasters and bucklers:Playing at the Bucklers. and the maidens (one of them playing on a Timbrel) in sight of their maisters
Dauncing for garlandes in the streets. and Dames to daunce for garlandes hanged thwart the streetes, which open pastimes in my youth, being now suppressed: worser practizes within dores are to be feared: as for the bayting of Buls and Beares, they are till this day much frequented. Slyding vpon the Ice is now but childrens play: but in hauking and hunting many graue citizens, at this present haue great delight, and do rather want leasure then good will to follow it. Of triumphant shewes

Shewes for triumphes. made by the citizens of London, ye may reade in the year 1236. the 20. of Henry the third, Andrew Bockwell then being Mayor, howe Helianor daughter to Reymonde earle of Prouance, riding through the citie towards Westminster, there to be crowned Quéene of England, the citie was adorned with silkes, & in the night with lampes, cressets, and other lights, without number, besides many Pageantes, and strange deuises there presented, the citizens also rodeThe citizens roade. to meet the King & Queene cloathed in long garments embroderedImbrodered garments about with gold, and silks of diuers colors, their horses gallantly trapped to the number of 360. euery man  bearing a cuppe of gold or siluer in his hand, and the kings trumpetters sounding before them: These citizens did minister wine, as Bottelers, which is their seruice at the coronation. More in the yeare 1298. for victorie obtained by Edward the first against the Scottes, euery citizen according to their seuerall trade, mate their seuerall shew, but specially the Fishmongers,Fishmongers procession, for triumph of victorie, against the Scots, more then a thousand

On the sunday before candlemas in the night, 130. citizens disguised, and wel horsed in a mummerie with sound of trumpets, shackbuts, cornets, Shalmes, and other minstrels, and innumerable torch lights of Waxe, rode from Newgate through Cheape ouer the bridge, through Southwarke, and so to Kennington besides Lambhith, where the young Prince remayned with his mother, and the Duke of Lancaster, his vncle, the carles of Cambrldge, Hertford, Warwicke, and Suffolke, with diuers other Lordes. In the first ranke did ride 48. in the likenes and habite of Esquires, two and two together cloathed in redde coates and gownes of Say, or sandall, with comely visors on their faces: after them came riding 48. knights in the same liucrie, of colour and stuffe: Then followed one richly arrayed like an Emperor, and after him some distance, one stately tyred like a Pope, whome followed 24. Cardinals, and after them eyght or tenne with black visors not amiable, as if they had béen Legates from some forrain Princes. These maskers, after they had entred the Mannor of Kenington, alighted from their horses and entred the hall on foot: which done, the Prince, his mother, and the Lordes came out of the chamber into the hall, whom the saide mummers did salute, shewing by a paire of dice vpon the table their desire to play with the Prince, which they so handled, that the Prince did alwayes win when be cast them. Then the mummers set to the prince thrée  Iewelles,The prince did winne three Iewels of the Maskers. one after another, which were a boule of gold, a cuppe of gold, and a ring of gold, which the Prince wanne at thrée casts. Then they set to the Princes mother, the Duke, the Earles, and other Lords, to euery one a ring of gold, which they also did win: After which they were feasted, and the musick sounded, the prince and Lords daunced on the one part with the mummers, which did also daunce, which iolitie being ended, they were againe made to drinke, and then departed in order as they came.
               Thus much for sportfull shewes in triumphes may suffice: of other shews for sports and pastimes yearly vsed, first at Christmasse, there was in the Kinges house wheresoeuer hee was lodged, a Lorde of misrule,I. of misrule at Christmas. or mayster of merie disporters, and the like had ye in the house of euery noble man, of honor, or good worshippe, were he spirituall, or temporall. Amongst the which the Maior of London, and either of the shiriffes had their seuerall Lordes of Misrule, euer contending without quarrell or offence, who should make the rarest pastimes to delight the beholders. These Lordes beginning their rule on Alhollon Eue, continued thesame till the morrow after the Feast of the Purification, commonly called Candlemas day: In all which space there were fine and subtile disguisinges, Maskes, and Mummeries, with playing at Cardes, for Counters, Nayles, and pointes, more for pastimes then for gaine.

Moreouer this Robin Hoode desired the King and Queene with their retinue to enter the greene wood, where, in harbors made of boughes and decked with flowers, they were set and serued plentifully with venison and wine, by Robin Hoode and his meynie, to their greate contentment, and had other Pageantes and Pastimes as yee may reade in my saide Author. I find also that in the moneth of May, the Citizens of London, of all estates, lightlie in euery parish, or sometimes two or three parishes ioyning together, had their seuerall mayinges, and did fetch in Maypoles, with diuers warlike shewes, with good Archers, Morrice dauncers, and other deuises for pastime all the day long, and towardes the euening they had stage playes and bonefires in the streetes, of these Mayinges, wee read in the raigne of Henry the 6. that the Aldermen and Shiriffs of London being on May day at the BishopBishops wood Bishops hall by Blethenhal greene. of Londons wood in the parish of Stebunheath, and hauing there a worshipful dinner for themselues and other commers, Lydgate, the Poet that was a Monke of Bray, sent to them by a Pursiuant a ioyfull cōmendation of that season contayning 16. staues in meter Royall, beginning thus.

The marching watch conteyned in number aboute 2000. men, parte of them being olde souldiers, of skill to bee captaines, Lieutenantes, Sergeantes, Corporals, &c.

               THe Auncient diuision of this Citie, was into Wardes, or Aldermanries: and therefore I will beginne at the East, and so proceede through the high and most principall streete of the citie, to the west,The Cite of London deuided from east to west. after this manner. First through Aldgate streete, to the west corner of S. Andrewes Church called Undershaft, on the right hand, and Lymestreete corner, on the left, all which is of Aldgate warde: from thence through Cornhill streete, to the west corner of Leaden hall, all which is of Limestreete warde: from thence leauing the streete, that leadeth to Bishopsgate on the right hand, and the way that leadeth into Grasse streete on the left, still through Cornhill streete, by the Conduite to the west corner against the Stockes, all which is in Cornhill warde, then by the saide Stockes (a market place both of fish and flesh standing in the middest of the Citie)The stockes market the midst of the Citie. through the Poultrie, (a streete so called) to the great conduite in west Cheape, and so through Cheape, to the Standarde, which is of Cheape warde, except on the South  side from Bow lane, to the saide Standarde, which is of Cordwainer streete ward. Then by the Standarde to the great crosse which is in Cripplegate warde, on the North side, and in Bredstreete warde on the south side. And to the little conduite by Paules gate from whence of olde time, the saide high streete stretched straight to Ludgate, all in the warde of Faringdon within, then deuided truely from East to West, but since that by meanes of the burning of Paules Church which was in the raigne of William the first surnamed Conqueror. Mawricius then Bishop of London, layde the foundation of a new church, so far in largenes exceeding the olde, that the way towardes Ludgate was thereby greately streightened, as before I haue at large discoursed: Now from the North to the South,The Citie de
                        •
                     uided from North to South. this citie was of olde time deuided not by a large high way or streete, as from East to West, but by a fayre Brooke of swéete water, which came from out the North fieldes through the wall, and midst of the citie into the riuer of Thames, which diuision is till this day constantlie and without change maintained. This water was called (as I haue said) Walbrooke,The course Walbrooke of running through, & from the wal the course whereof to prosecute it particularlie, was and is from the said wal to S. Margarets church, in Lothberry: from thence beneath the lower part of the Grocers hall, about the east part of their Kitchen, vnder S. Mildredes church, somewhat west from the saide Stockes market: from thence through Buckels berry, by one great house builded of stone and timber, called the old Bardge. because Barges out of the riuer of Thames were rowed vp so far into this Brooke: on the backside of the houses in Walbrooke streete (which streete taketh his name of the saide Brooke:) by the west ende of S. Iohns church vpon Walbrooke, vnder Horshew Bridge, by the west side of Tallow Chandlers hall, and of the Skinners hall, and so behinde the other houses, to Elbow Lane, and by a parte thereof downe Greenewitch lane, into the Riuer of Thames. This is the course of Walbrooke, which was of olde time bridged ouer in diuers places, for passage of horses and men, as neede required: but since by meanes of encrochment on the bankes thereof, the channell being greatly streightned, and other noyances don thereunto, at length the same by common consent was Arched ouer with bricke, and pa
                     •
                  ed with stone, equall  with the ground, where through it passed, and is now in most places builded vpon, that no man may by the eye discerne it, and therefore the trace thereof is hardly knowne, to the common people.
               The Citie thus deuided from East to West, and from North to South: I am further to shew how the same was of olde time broken into diuers partes called wardes, whereof Fitzstephen more then foure hundred yeares ago writeth thus. This Citie (sayeth hee) euen as Rome, is deuided into wardes, it hath yearely Shiriffes in steade of Consuls. It hath the dignity of Senators in Aldermen &c. The number of these wards in London were both before & in the raign of Henry the third: 24. in al: whereof 13 lay on the East side of the saide Walbrooke, and 11. on the West side of the same: notwithstanding these 11.Patent Recorde. grew much more larger and bigger then these on the East, and therefore in the yeare of Christ, 1393. the 17. of Richarde the second, Farengdon warde which was then one entier warde, but mightelie increased of buildinges without the gates: was by Parliament appointed to be deuided into twaine, and to haue two Aldermen, to wit Faringdon within and Faringdon without, which made vp the number of 12. wardes on the west side of Walbrooke, and so the whole number of 25. on both sides: moreouer in the yere 1550. the Maior, Commonalty, and Citizens of London, purchasing the Liberties of the Borough of Southwark, appointed the same to bee a warde of London, and so became the number of 13. wardes on the East, 12. on the West, and one in the South of the riuer of Thames, lying in the said Borough of Southwarke, within the county of Surrey, which in all arise to the number of 26. wardes and 26. Aldermen of London.
               
               
                  The names of Wards on the East part of Walbrooke are these.

They besought the king to haue this land, with the Libertie of a Guilde for euer: the king granted to their request with conditions following: that is, that each of them should victoriously accomplish thrée combates, one aboue the ground, one vnder ground, and the thirde in the water, and after this at a certaine day in East Smithfield, they should run with speares against all commers, all which was gloriously performed: and the same day the king named it knighten Guilde,Boundes Knighten Guild or Portsok

               Néere adioyning vnto this Abbey on the South side thereof, was sometime a Farme, belonging to the said Nunnerie, at the which I my selfe in my youth haue fetched many a halfe pennie worth of milke, and neuer had lesse then thrée Ale pints for a halfpenie in y• sommer, nor lesse then one Ale quart for a halfpennie in the winter, alwaies hot from the cow, as the same was milked and strained. One Trolop, and afterwardes Goodman, were the Farmers there, and had 30. or 40. kine to the payle. Goodmans sonne being heyre thereof, let out the ground first for grazing of horse, and then for garden plottes, and liued like a gentleman thereby. On thother side of that stréete, lyeth the ditch without the walles of the citie, which of old time was vsed to lie open, and was alwaies from time to time cleansed from filth and mud, as neede required, and was of great breadth and so déepe, that diuers watring horses, where they thought it shallowest, were drowned both horse and man. But now of latter time, the same ditch is inclosed, and the bankes thereof let out for garden plottes, carpenters yardes, bowling Allies, and diuers houses bee thereon builded, whereby the ditch is filled vp, and made shalllow enough.
               From Ealdegate East, lyeth a large stréete, and high way, sometime replenished with few, but fayre and cleanly buildinges: on the North side whereof the first building was the parish church of Saint Buttolph, in a large cemitorie, or church yarde.

               This Hogge lane stretcheth North to Saint Mary Spittle, without Bishopsgate, and within these fortie foure yeares last, had on both sides fayre hedgerowes of Ealme trées, with bridges and easie styles to passe ouer into the pleasant fieldes, very commodious for citizens therein to walke, shoote, and otherwise to recreate and refresh their dulled spirites in the swéete and wholesome ayre, which is now within few yeares made a continual building throughout, of garden houses, and small cottages: & the fields on either sides be turned into garden plottes, teynter yardes, bowling Alleyes, and such like, from Hounds ditch in the West, so farre as White chappel, and further in the East. The South side of the high way from Ealdegate had some few tenements thinly scattered here and there, with much voyde space betweene them, vp to the said Barre, but now that stréete is not onely fully replenished with buildings, outwarde, and also pestered with diuers Allies, on eyther side to the Barres, but also euen to White chappell, and beyond.
               From Aldegate Northwest to Bishopsgate, lyeth the ditch of the citie in that part called Hounds ditch,Hounds ditch. for that in old time when the same lay open much filth (conueyed forth of the citie) especially dead dogges was there laid or cast: wherefore of latter time a mudde wall was made inclosing the ditch, to kéepe out the laying of such filth as had beene accustomed. Ouer against this mudde wall on the other side of the stréete, was a fayre fielde, sometime belonging to the Priory of the Trinitie, and since by Sir Thomas Audley giuen to Magdalen Colledge in Cambridge: this field (as all other about the citie) was inclosed, reseruing open passage there into, for such as were disposed. Towards the stréet were some small cottages, of two stories high, and little garden plottes backewarde, for poore bedred peopleBedred people in Hounds ditch. (for in that stréete dwelt none other) builded by some Prior of the holy Trinitie, to whom that ground belonged. In my youth I remember, deuout people aswell men as women of this citie, were accustomed oftentimes especially on Frydayes weekely to walke that way purposely, and  there to bestow their charitable almes, euery poore man or woman lying in their bed within their window, which was towards the streete open so low, that euery man might see them, a cleane linnen cloth lying in their window, and a payre of beades to shew that there lay a bedred bodie vnable but to pray onely. This stréet was first paued in the year 1503. about the later raign of Henry y• eight, thrée brethren that were Gunfounders surnamed Owens, gate ground there to build vpon and to inclose for casting of brasse ordinance.Brasse ordinance cast in Hounds ditch

               These occupied a good part of y• stréet on the field side, and in short time diuers other also builded there, so that the poore bedred people were worne out, and in place of their homely cottages, such houses builded, as do rather want roome, then rent. The residue of the field was for the most part made into a garden, by a Gardener, named Casway, one that serued the markets, with hearbes and rootes, and in the last yeare of King Edward the sixt, the same was parcelled into gardens, wherein are now many fayre houses of pleasure builded. On the ditch side of this streete, the mudde wall is also by little and little all taken downe, the banke of the ditch being raysed made leuel ground, and turned into garden plottes, and Carpenters yardes, and many large houses are there builded, by which meanes the ditch is filled vp, and both the ditch and wall so hidden that they cannot be seene of the passers by.

From and without the Tower ditch West and by North is the said Tower hillTower hill sometime a large plot of grounde nowe greatly strengthened by meanes of incrochments, (vnlawfully made and suffred) for gardens and houses, some on the banke of the Tower ditch, (whereby the ditch is marred) but more neere vnto the wall of the Citie from the Posterne North till ouer against the principall fore gate of the Lord Lumleyes house, &c.

Notwithstanding in my youth, I haue seene them passe currant, but with so me difficultie, for that the English halfepence were then (though not so broade) somewhat thicker and stronger.

Now for the two church lanes, they meeting on the south side of this Church and Churchyarde, do ioyne in one: and running down to the Thames streete: the same is called S. Dunstans hill, at the lower ende whereof the said Thames streete, towards the west on both sides almost to Belins gate, but towards the east vp to the water gate, by the Bulwarke of the Tower, is all of Towerstreete warde. In this streete on the Thames side are diuers large landing places, called wharffes, or keyes, for Cranage vp of wares and marchandizes, as also for shipping of wares from thence to bee transported. These wharffes and keyes commonly beare the names of their owners, and are therefore changeable. I read in the 26. of Henry the first that in the parish of S. Dunstone in the East a Tenement called Passekes
                  Passekes Wharfe and Hornars Key. wharffe and an other called Horners key in Thames streete, were granted to VVilliam Haringdon Esquire.

               On the North side, as well as on the South of this Thames streete is many fayre houses large for stowage, builded for Marchantes, but towardes the east ende thereof, namely ouer against Galley key, Woole key, and the custome house, there haue been, of old time some large buildings of stone, the ruines where of doe yet remaine, but the first builders and owners of them are worn out of memorie, wherefore the common people affirme Iulius Cesar
                  Iulius Cesars house by the Tower as was said. to bee the builder thereof, as also of the Tower it selfe. But thereof I haue spoken alreadie. Some are of an other opinion, and that a more likely, that this great stone building was sometime the lodging appointed for the Princes of VVales,
                  Princes of Wales their lodging. when they repayred to this cittie, and that therefore the streete in that part, is called Pety Wales, which name remaineth there most commonly vntill this day: euen as where the kinges of Scotland were vsed to be lodged betwixt Charing crosse and white hall, it is likewise called Scotland: and where the Earles of Briton, were lodged without Aldersgate, the streete is called Britaine streete, &c.

This Priorie was founded by Matilde the Queene, wife to Henry the first, in the same place where Siredus sometime began to erect a Church in honor of the Crosse, and of S. Marie Magdalen, of which the Deane and Chapter of Waltham were wont to receiue 30.
                     •
                  . The Queene was to acquite her Church thereof, and in Exchange gaue vnto them a mill. King Henry her husband confirmed her gift: This Church was giuen to Norman, the first Cannon regular in all England.
                  Priorie of the Trinitie of Canons regular. The said Queene also gaue vnto the same Church and those that serued God therein the port of Ealdgate, & the Soke therunto belonging, with al customes so frée as she had held the same,

                  , Blanks, which she had of the Citie of Excester: as appeareth by her deed, wherein she nameth the house Christs Church, and reporteth Aldegate to be of her demaines, which she granteth with 2. parts of the rent of the citie of Excester. Norman tooke vpon him to bee Prior of Christes Church, in the yere of Christ 1108 in the Parishes of S. Marie Magdalen, S. Michael. S. Katherine, and the Blessed Trinitie, which now was made but one Parish of the Holy Trinitie, and was in olde time of the Holy Crosse, or Holy Roode Parish. The Priorie was builded on a peece of ground in the Parish of S. Katherine, towards Ealdgate, which lieth in length betwixt the Kinges streete, by the which men go towardes Ealdgate: neare to the Chappell of S. Michaell towardes the North, and conteyneth in length 83. els half quarter & quartern of the kings Iron eln, & lyeth in bredth &c. the Soke & ward of Ealdgate, was then bounded as I haue before shewed, the Queen was a mean also that ye land and English Knighten Guild, was giuen vnto the Prior Norman the honorable man Geffery de Glinton was a great helper therin and obtayned that the Canons might inclose the way betwixt their church and the wal of the citie &c.Prior of Christ church an Alderman of London. This Priorie in processe of time became a very fayre and large church, rich in lands and ornaments and passed all the Priories in the citie of London or  shire of Middlesex, the Prior whereof was an Alderman of London, to wit, of Portsoken warde. I reade that Eustacius the 8. Prior, about the yeare 1264. because hee would not deale with temporall matters instituted Theobald Fitz Iuonis Alderman of Portsoken Warde vnder him. And that William Rysing, Prior of Christes Church was sworne Alderman of the said Portsoken Warde, in the first of Richard the second. These Priors haue fitten and ridden amongst the Aldermen of London, in liuery like vnto them, sauing that his habite was in shape of a spirituall person as I my self haue séene in my childhood: at which time the Prior kept a most bountifull house of meate and drinke both for rich and poore, aswell within the house as at the gates, to all commers according to their estates.

The Canons were sent to other houses of the same order, and the Priory with the apurtenances King Henry gaue vnto Sir Thomas Audley newly knighted, and after made Lorde Chauncelor. This Sir Thomas Audeley offered the great Church of this Priorie, with a ring of nine bels well tuned (wherof foure the greatest are now at Stebunhith, and the fiue lesser at S. Stephens in Colemans stréete) to the parishioners of Saint Katherine Christ church, in exchaunge for their small parrish Church, minding to haue pulled it downe, & to haue builded there towardes to stréete: But the parishioners hauing doubtes in their heades of afterclappes, refused the offer.

The parish Church of S. Katherine
                  Parish church of S. Katherin Christs church standeth in the Cemitory of the late dissolued Priorie of the holy Trinitie, and is therefore called S. Katherine Christ Church. This Church séemeth to bee a very olde thing, since the building whereof the high streete hath béene so often raysed by pauementes, that now men are faine to descende into the saide Church by diuers steppes.

                  Parish church of S. Andrew Vndershaft. the Apostle, with an addition (to bee knowne from other Churches of that name) of the Knape or vndershaft, and so called S. Andrew Vndershaft because that of olde time, euery yeare on May day in the morning it was vsed, that an high or long shaft (or May pole) was set vppe there, in the midst of the street before the south dore of the said Church, which shaft when it was set on end, & fixed in the ground, was higher then the Church stéeple. Geffrey Chawcer, writing of a vaine boaster, hath these wordes, meaning of the said shaft.A shaft or May pole higher then the church steeple

               This shaft was not raysed at any time since euill May day, (so called of an insurrection made by Prentises, and other young persons against Aliens in the yeare 1517) but the said shaft was laid along ouer the dores and vnder the pentises of one row of houses, and Alley gate, called of the shaft, shaft Alley, (being of the possessions of Rochester bridge) in the Warde of Limestreete. It was there I say hanged on Iron hookes many years, till the third of king Edward the sixt, that one Sir Stephen, curat of S. Katherine  Christes Church, preaching at Paules crosse, said there, that this shaft was made an Idoll (by naming the church of S. Andrew, with the addition of vnder that shaft:Shaft or May pole preached against, at Paules crosse. he perswaded therefore that the names of churches might bee altered: also that the names of daies in the wéeke might bee changed, the fish dayes to be kept any dayes, except friday and saterday, and the Lent any time, saue onely betwixt Shrouetide and Easter: I heard his sermon, and saw the effect that followed: for in the afternoone of that present sonday, the neighbors and tenants to the said Bridge, ouer whose dores the said shaft had laine (after they had well dined to make themselues strong) gathered more helpe, and with great labour raysing the shaft from the hookes whereon it had rested two and thirtie yeares, they sawed it in péeces,Shaft or May pole sawed in peeces and burnt. euery man taking for his share so much as had layne ouer his dore & stall, the length of his house, and they of the Alley deuided amongst them so much as had layne ouer their Alley gate. Thus was this Idoll (as he poore man tearmed it) mangled and after burned.
               Soone after was there a commotion of the Commons in Norfolke, Suffolke, Essex, and other shires, by meanes whereof streight orders being taken for the suppression of rumors) dyuers persons were apprehended and executed by the martial Law, amongst the which the Baylife of Romford

                  Lymestreete. of making or selling of Lyme there, (as is supposed,) the East side of this Lymestreete, from the North corner thereof to the middest is of Ealdgate ward, as is aforesaide: the west side, for the most parte from the saide North corner, southward, is of this Lymestreete warde: the southende on both sides is of Langborne warde: the bodie of this Lymestreete warde, is of the high streete called Cornhill streete,High streete of Cornhill. which stretcheth from Limestreete on the south side, to the west corner of Leaden hall: and on the North side from the southwest corner of S. Marie streete, to an other corner ouer against Leaden hall.
               Now for S. Marie streete, the west side thereof is of this Limestreete warde, and also the streete which runneth by the Northende of this S. Marie streete, on both sides, from thence west to an house called the Wrestlers (a signe so called) almost to Bishopsgate. And these are the bounds of this small warde.
               Monuments or places notable in this warde be these: In Lymestreet are diuers fayr houses, for Marchants & others, there was sometime a mansion house of the kinges, called the kinges ArtirceAn house in Lymestreete called the kinges Artirce. whereof I finde recorde in the 14. of Edwarde the first, but now grown out of knowledge. I reade also of an other greate house in the westside of Lymestreete, hauing a Chappel on the south, and a garden on the west, then belonging to the Lorde Neuell, (which Garden is now called the Greene yarde of the Leaden hal. This house in the ninth of Richard the second, pertayned to Sir Simon Burley, and Sir Iohn Burley, his brother, and of late the faide house was taken downe, and the forefront thereof new builded of timber by Hugh Offley Alderman. At the North west corner of Lymestreete was of olde time one greate Messuage called  
                  Benbriges Inne,Benbriges Inne. 
                  Ralph Hollend Draper, about the yere 1452. gaue it to Iohn Gill, maister, and to the Wardens and Fraternity of Taylors and Linnen Armorers of S. Iohn Baptill, in London, and to their successors for euer. They did set vp in place thereof a fayre large frame of timber, contayning in the high street one great house, and before it to the corner of Limestreete, three other Tenementes, the corner house being the largest, and then downe Limestreete diuers proper Tenementes. Al which the Marchant Taylors in the raigne of Edwarde the sixt solde to Stephen Kirton Marchantaylor, and Alderman: this worshipfull man, and the Gentlewoman his widdow after him, kept those houses in good reparations, neuer put out one Tennant, tooke no fines, nor raised Rents of them, which was x.

                  .the peece yearely: But whether that fauour did ouerliue her funerall, the Tenantes now can best declare.
               Next vnto this on the high streete, was the Lorde Souches MessuageMessuage of the Lord Souch. or Tenement and other. In place whereof Richarde VVhethill, Marchant Taylor builded a fayre house, with an high Tower, the second in number, and first of timber, that euer I learned to haue beene builded to ouerlooke neighboures in this citie.
               This Richarde then a young man became in short time so tormented with Goutes in his ioyntes, of the hands and legges, that hee could neither feede himselfe, nor goe farther then hee was led, much lesse, was hee able to clime, and take the pleasure of the height of his Tower. Then is there an other fayre house, builded by Stephen Kyiton Alderman, Alderman Lee doth now possesse it.
               Then is there a fayre house of olde time called the Greene gate,Patent. by which name one Mighel Pistoy Lumbard held it, with a tenement & 9. shops, in the raigne of Richard the second, who in the 
                     •
                  5. of his raigne gaue it to Roger Crophull, and Thomas Bromeflet, Esquiers, by the name of the Greene gate,Messuage called the Greene gate. in the parish of S, Andrew vpon Cornhill, in Lymestreete ward: since the which time Philip Malpas,

                   and other Rebels in the yeare 1449.
               Afterwades in the raigne of Henry the seuenth, it was seased into the kinges handes, and then granted, first vnto Iohn Alston, after that to William de la Riuars, and since by Henry the eight, to Iohn Mutas (a Picarde) or Frenchman, who dwelled there, and harbored in his house, many Frenchmen, that kalendred wolstedes, and did other thinges contrary to the Franchises of the Citizens: wherefore on euill May day, which was in the yeare 1517. the Prentizes and other spoiled his house: and if they could haue found Mutas,

               Next is a house called the Leaden PortchLeaden Portch. lately deuided into two Tenementes, whereof one is a Tauerne, and then one other house for a Marchante, likewise called, the Leaden Portch: but now turned to a Cookes house, next is a fayre house and a large, wherein diuers Maioralities haue beene kept, whereof twaine in my remembrance: to wit Sir William Bowiar, and Sir Henry Huberthorne.
               
               The next is Leaden Hall,Leaden hall. of which I reade, that in the yere 1309. it belonged to Sir Hugh Neuill knight, and that the Ladie Alice his widow, made a Feofment thereof, by the name of Leaden hall, with the aduowsons of the Church of S. Peter vpon Cornhill, and other churches, to Richard Earle of Arundel and Surrey, 1362. More in the yeare 1380. Alice Neuill, widow to Sir Iohn Neuill knight of Essex, confirmed to Thomas Cogshal, & others the said Manor of Leaden hal, ye aduowsions &c. In the yere 1384. Humphrey de Bohun, Earle of Hereforde, had the saide Mannor. And in the yeare 1408. Robert Rikeden of Essex, and Margaret his wife confirmed to Richarde Whitington and other citizens of London, the saide Mannor of Leaden hall, with the Appurtenances, the aduowsions of S. Peters Church, S. Margarets Pattens, &c, And in the yere 1411 the saide Whitington and other confirmed the same to the Maior and Comminaltie of London, whereby it came to the possession  of the Citie. Then in the yeare 1443. the 21. of Henry the sixt,Licence to take vp leade to the building vp of common Granarie.

In the yeare next following the Parson and Parish of S. Dunstone in the east of London, seeing the famous and mighty man (for the wordes be in the graunte: cum nobilis
& potens. vir.) Symon Eyre, citizen of London, among other his works of pietie, effectually determined to erect and build a certaine Granarie vpon the soile of the same citie at Leaden hall, of his owne charges, for the common vtilitie of the saide citie, to the amplifiyng, and enlarging of the saide Garnary, granted to Henry Frowicke then Maior, the Aldermen, and Comminaltie and their successors, for euer, all their Tenementes, with the Appurtenances sometime called the Horsemill in Grasse streete, for the anuall rente of foure pounde, &c. Also certaine Euidences (of an Alley and Tenements pertayning to the Horsemill,Horsmill in Grassestreete adioyning to the saide Leaden hall in Grassestreete, giuen by William Kingstone Fishmonger, vnto the parish church of S.

                     Liber albus. Beame for tronage of wools at Leaden hal
&c. True it is that in the yeare 1464. the thirde of Edward the fourth, it was agreede by the Maior, Aldermen, and Comminalty of London, that notwithstanding the kinges letters patentes, lately before granted vnto them touching the Troynage or Weighing of wares to be holden at the Leaden hall, yet suite should be made to the king for new letters pattents to be granted to the Maior of the Staple, for the Tronage of Wolles to be holden there, & order to be taken, by the discretion of Thomas Cooke, then Maior, y• counsaile of the citie, Geffery Filding, then Maior of the Staple at Westminster, and of his counsaile, what shoulde be paide to the Maior and Aldermen of the citie for the laying and howsing of the Woolles there, that so they might be brought forth and weighed, &c.
               Touching the chappell there, I finde that in the yeare 1466. by licence obtayned of king Edwarde the fourth, in the sixt of his raigne, a Fraternitie of the Trinity, of 60. priestes,A brotherhood of 60. Priestes in the Chapel of Leaden hall
                        •
                     
                   (besides other Brethren, and Sisters) in the same Chappell was founded by William Rouse, Iohn Risbie, and Thomas Ashby, priestes, some of the which 60 priestes, euery market day, in the fore no
                     •
                  ne, did celebrate diuine seruice there, to such market  people as repayred to prayer, and once euery yeare, they mette altogether, and had solemne seruice, with procession of all the brethren and sisters. This foundation was in the yere, 1512. by a common counsaile confirmed to the 60. Trinity Priestes, and to their successors at the will of the Maior and Comminaltie. Now it did befall that in the yeare, 1484. a greate fire happened vpon this Leaden hal,Leaden hall burned. by what casualty I know not, but much howsing was there destroyed with all the stockes for Guns, and other prouision belonging to the Citie, which was a greate losse, and no lesse charge to be repaired by them. In the yere 1503. the eighteenth of Henry the seuenth,Richard Arnold a request was made by the Cōmons of the Citie, concerning the vsage of the saide Leaden hall, in forme as followeth. Please it the Lord Maior, Aldermen, and common Counsaile, to enact that all French men, bringing Canuas, Linnen cloth, and other wares to be solde, and all Forrens bringing Wolffeds, Sayes, Staimus, Kiuerings, Nayles, Iron worke,A request of the Citizens to the Maior and Aldermen. or any other wares, and also all manner Forrens bringing Lead to the citie to be solde, shall bring all such their wares aforesaide to the open market of Leaden hall there,Leaden hall market for Canuas and Linnen cloth. and no where else to be shewed, solde and vttered, like as of old time it hath beene vsed, vpon paine of forfeyture of all the saide wares shewed or solde in any other place then aforesaide, the shew of the saide wares to bee made three dayes in the weeke, that is to say Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, it is also thought reasonable that the common Beame be kept from henceforth in the Leaden hall, and the Farmer to pay therefore reasonable rent to the chamber: for better it is that the chamber haue aduantage thereby, then a Forren person,
& also the saide Leaden hal, which is more chargeable now by halfe then profitable, shall better beare out the charges thereof, also the common BeameCommon Beame to be kept in Leaden hall. for wolle at Leaden hall,Leaden hall pertayning

                   more largely for the keeping of their goodes, then Free men. Thus much for the request of  the Commons at this time.
               Now to set downe some proofe that the saide hall hath beene imployed and vsed as a Granarie for Corne and Grayne (as the same was first appointed) leauing all former examples, this one may suffice: Roger Acheley MaiorLeaden hall vsed as a garna
                        •
                      Roger Acheley Maior, made good prouision for the citie of London, in the yere 1512. the thirde of Henry the eight, when the saide Maior entred the Maioralitie, there was not found one hundred quarters of wheate in al the Garners of the citie, eyther within the Liberties or neare adioyning: through the which scarcitie, when the Cartes of Stratforde
                  Bread carts of Stratford at the Bow. came laden with Bread to the Citie (as they had béen accustomed) there was such presse aboute them, that one man was readie to destroy an other, in striuing to be serued for their monie: but this scarcitie lasted not long: for the Maior in short time made such prouision of Wheate, that the Bakers both of London, and of Stratforde were weary of taking it vp, and were forced to take much more then they wold, and for the rest the Maior laide out the money and stowed it vp in Leaden hall, and other Garnars of the Citie. This Maior also kept the market so wel, that he would be at the Leaden hall, by foure a clocke in the sommer morninges, and from thence hee went to other markets, to the great comfort of the Citizens. I reade also that in the yeare, 1528. the 20. of Henry the eight, Surueyers were appointed to view the Garnars of the Citie, namely the Br
                     •
                  dge house, and the Leaden hal, how they were stored of Grayne for seruice of the Citie: And because I haue here before spoken of the breade cartes comming from Stratforde at the Bow, yee shall vnderstand that of olde time the Bakers of Bread at Stratforde, were allowed to bring dayly (except the Saboath and principall Feast) diuers long Cartes laden with Bread, the same being two ounces in the penny wheat loafe heauier then the penny wheate loafe baked in the Citie, the same to bee solde in Cheape, thrée or foure Cartes standing there, betweene Guthurans lane, and Fausters lane ende, one cart on Cornhill by the Conduite, and one other in Grassestreete. And I haue read that in the fourth yeare of Edwarde the second, Richarde Reffeham being Maior, a Baker named Iohn of Stratforde:
                  
                     Liber d. A Baker of Stratford punished in London for baking bread vnder the Assise. for making Breade lesser then the Assisse, was with a fooles whoode on his head, and loues of bread  about his neck, drawn on a hurdle through the stréets of this citie: Moreouer in the 44. of Edward the thirde. Iohn Chichester being Mayor of London,
                  
                     Iohn Mall. Breadcarts frō Stratford misused in this city in time of scarcity. I reade in the visions of Pierce Plowman, a booke so called as followeth.
               There was a carefull commune, when no cart came to towne with baked bread fro Stratford: tho gan beggars weep & workemen were agast, a little this will be thought long in the date of our Drirte, in a drie Auerell a thousand and three hundred, twise thirtie and tenne &c.
               These Bakers of Stratford left seruing of this Citie I know not vpon what occasion, about 30. yeares since: In the yeare 1519. a petitionA petition by the commons concerning the vse of the Leaden hall. was exhibited by the commons to the common counsaile, and was by them allowed, concerning the Leaden hall, how they would haue it vsed, viz. Méekely beseeching sheweth vnto your good Lordship, and maysterships, diuers cittzens of this Cittie, which vnder correction thinke, that the great place called the Leaden hall, should nor ought not to be letten to farme, to any person or persons, and in especiall to any fellowship or companie incorporate, to haue and hold the same hall for tearme of yeares, for such inconueniences as therby may ensue, and come to the hur
                     •
                   of the common weale of the said cittie, in time to come, as somewhat more largely may appeare in the articles following.
               First if any assemblie, or hastie gathering of the commons of the said Cittie for oppressing or subduing, of misruled people within the said Cittie hereafter shall happen to be called or commanded by the Mayor, Aldermen, and other gouernors and counsellors of the saide cittie for the time being, there is none so conuenient méet and necessarie a place to assemble them in, within the said cittie, as the said Leaden hall, both for largenes of roome, and for their sure defence in time of their counselling together about the premises. Also in that place hath béen vsed the artillerie, Guns, and other armors of the said cittie to be safely kept in a readines for y• safegard, wealth, and defence of the said cittie, to bee had and occupyed at times when néede required. As also the store of timber for the necessarie reparations of the tenements belonging to the chamber of the said citie, there cōmonly hath beene kept. Item if any triumph or noblenesse were to be done or shewed by the communalty of the  cittie for the honour of our soueraigne Lord, the King, and realme, and for the worship of the said cittie, the said Leaden hall is most meete and conuenient place to prepare and order the said triumph therein, and from thence to issue forth to the places therefore appointed, Item, at any largesse or dole of any money made vnto the poore people of this cittie, it hath beene vsed to be done and giuen in the said Leaden Hall,Leaden Hall a market place for victulers & the people to stand drie. for that the said place is most meete therefore. Item, the honorable Father, that was maker of the said hall, had a speciall will, intent and mind, that (as it is commonly said) the market men and women that came to the Cittie with victuailes and other thinges should haue their free standing within the said Leaden Hall in wet weather, to kéepe themselues and their wares dry, and thereby to incourage them and all other to haue the better will and desire the more plenteously to resort to the said Cittie, to victuaile the same. And if the saide Hall should be letten to farme, the will of the said honorable father should neuer be fulfilled nor take effect. Item, if the said place which is the chiefe fortresse and most necessarie place within all the Cittie, for the tuition and safegarde of the same, should be letten to farme out of the handes of the chiefe heades of the same Citie, and especially to an other bodie politique, it might at length by likelihood bee occasion of discord, and debate betwéene the saide bodies politique, which God defend.
               For these and many other great and resonable causes, which hereafter shalbe shewed to this honourable Court, your said beséechers think it much necessary, that the said Hall be stil in the hands of this cittie, and to be surely kept by sadde and discréet officers in such wise, that it may alway be ready to be vsed and occupyed for the common weale of the said Citie, when need shal require, and in no wise to bee letten to any bodie politique. Thus much for the petition.
               About the yeare 1534. great meanes was made about the Leaden HallLeaden hall ment to haue beene made a Bu
                        •
                     se for marchants. to haue the same made a Burse for the assemblie of marchants, as they had béene accustomed in Lombard stréet, many common counselles, were called to that ende, but in the yeare 1535. Iohn Champnais being Mayor, it was fully concluded that the Burse should remaine in Lombard stréete, as afore: and  Leaden Hall no more to be spoken of concerning this matter.
               The vse of Leaden Hall in my youth was thus: In a part of the North quadrant on the East side of the North gate, was the common beames for weighing of wooll, and other wares, as had béene accustomed: on the west side the gate was the scales to way meale: the other thrée sides were reserued for the most part to the making and resting of the pageants shewed at midsommer in the watch: the remnant of the sides and quadrantes were imployed for the stowage of wooll sackes, but not closed vp: the lofts aboue were partly vsed by the painters in working for the decking of pageants and other deuises, for beautifying of the watch and watchmen, the residue of the loftes were letten out to marchantes, the wooll winders and packers therein to wind and pack their wools: And thus much for Leaden Hall may suffice.
               Now on the North of Limestréete warde in the high stréet, are diuers faire houses for marchants, and proper tenements for artificers, with an alley also called Shaft Alley, of the shaft or Maypole sometime resting ouer the gale thereof, as I haue declared in Aldegate warde. In the yeare 1576 partly at the charges of the parish of S. Andrew, and partly at the charges of the chamber of London, a water pumpeA pumpe in the high street of Limestreet warde. was raised in this high stréet of Limestréete warde, néere vnto Limestréet corner: for the placing of the which pumpe, hauing broken vp the ground, they were forced to digge more then two fadome déepe before they came to any maine ground:Cornehil street in some place raysed 2, fadom higher then of old time, as appeared by buildings founde so deep. where they found a harth made of Britaine (or Romayne) tyle as they call it, euery tile halfe yarde square and about two inches thicke: they found cole lying there also, (for that lying whole will neuer consume) then digging one fadome into the maine they found water sufficient, and set vp the pumpe. Thus much for the high stréete.
               In S. Mary streeteS. Mary street. had ye of old time parish Church of S. Mary the virgine, S. Vrsula, and the 11000.Parish church of Mary S. Vrsula, & 11000 vigines called at the Axe, letten out for a warehouse. virgines, which Church was commonly called S. Mary at the Axe, of the signe of an Axe, ouer against the East end thereof, or S. Marie Pellipar of a plot of ground lying on the North side thereof, pertayning to the Skinners in London. This parrish about the yeare 1565. was vnited to the parish Church of S. Andrew Vndershaft, 
                   and so was S. Mary at the Axe suppressed, and letten out to bee a warehouse for a Marchant. Also against the North end of this S. Mary stréete was sometime one other parish Church of S. Augustine,
                  Parish church of S. Austine in the wall made a chappell to the papey, and since pulled downe made a stable. called S. Augustine in the wall, for that if stood adioyning to the wall of the Citie: and otherwise called S. Augustines Papey, for that about the yeare 1430. in the raigne of Henry the sixt, the same Church was allowed to the brethren of the Papey, the house of poore priestes, whereof I haue spoken in Aldgate warde. The parishioners of this Church were appointed to the parish Church of Alhallowes in the wall, which is in Breadstreet ward, this brotherhood (called Papey) being suppressed, the church of S. Augustine was pulled downe, and in place thereof one Grey a Pothecarie builded a stable, and a heyloft: it is now a dwelling house, reseruing the Church yarde for a garden plot. Those two parish Churches both lying in the Warde of Limestréet, being thus suppressed, there is not any one parish church or place for diuine seruice in that warde, but the inhabitants thereof repayre to Churches, out of their Ward, namely to S. Peter vpon Cornehill in Cornehill warde, S. Andrew in Aldegate warde, Alhallowes in the wall in Breadstréete warde, and some to S. Denis in Langborne warde. Now because of late there hath beene some question, to what ward this Church or chappel of S. Augustine Papie should of right belong, for the same hath béen challenged by them of Aldgate warde, and without reason taken into Bishopsgate warde, from Limestréete warde, I am somewhat to touch it. About 30. yeares since the chamber of London granted a lease of ground (in these words) lying néere London wall in the ward of Limestréet,Houses by London wall, in the warde of Limestreet. from the West of the said church or chappell of S. Augustine, Papey, towardes Bishopsgate &c. On the which plat of grounde the lease, builded thrée faire tenements, and placed tennantes there: these were charged to beare scot and lot, and some of them to beare office in Limestréete warde: all which they willingly did without grudging. And when any suspected or disordered persons were by the Landlord placed there, the officers of Limestréete warde fetched them out of their houses, committed them to the warde, procured their due punishments, and banished them from thence: whereby in short time that place was reformed & brought into good order:  which thing being noted by them of Aldegate Warde, they moued their Alderman Sir Thomas Offley to call in those houses to be of his warde: but I my selfe shewing a faire ledgier booke sometime pertaining to the late dissolued Priorie of the holy Trinitie within Aldegate, wherein were set downe the iust bounds of Aldegate ward, before Sir Thomas Offley, Sir Rowland Heyward, the common counsell and Wardemote inquest of the saide Limestréete ward, Sir Thomas Offley gaue ouer his challenge: and so that matter rested in good quiet, vntill the yeare 1579. that Sir Rychard Pype being Mayor, and Alderman of Bishopsgate wardeA part of Limestreet ward vniust withheld by Bishopsgate ward. challenged those houses, to be of his Warde, whereunto (without reason shewed) Sir Rowland Heyward yeelded: and thus is that side of the stréete from the North corner of S.

It was an Hospitall for distracted people: the Mayor and communaltie purchased the patronage thereof with al the lands and tenements thereuuto belonging, in the yeare 1546 the same yeare King Henry the eight gaue the Hospitall thereof vnto the citie: the Church and chappell whereof were taken downe in the raigne of Quéene Elizabeth, and houses builded there, by the Gouernors of Christes Hospitall in London. In this place people that be distraight in wits, are by the suite of their friendes receyued and kept as afore it was vsed, but not without charges to their bringers in. In the yere 1569. Sir Thomas Roe 
                   Merchant Taylor Mayor, caused to bee inclosed with a wall of bricke, about one acre of ground, being part of the said Hospitall of Bethelem, to wit, on the west, on the bancke of déepe ditch, so called, parting the said hospitall of Bethlem from the More field: this be did for burial,Buriall for the dead prepared Deepe ditch by Bethelem. in ease of such parishes in London as wanted ground, conuenient within their parishes. The Ladie his wife was there buried (by whose persuasion he inclosed it) but himselfe borne in London was buried in the parish church of Hackney.
               
               From this Hospitall Northward vpon the stréetes side many houses haue beene builded with alleyes backeward, of late time too much pestered with people (a great cause of infection) vp to the barres.

Next to that a farre more large and beautifull house with gardens of pleasure, bowling alleyes, and such like, builded by Iasper Fisher free of the Goldsmithes, late one of the sixe Clearkes of the Chauncery, and a Iustice of peace. It hath since for a time beene the Earle of Oxfords place. The Quéenes Maiestie Elizabeth hath lodged there. It now belongeth to M. Cornewallos. This house being so largely and sumptuously builded by a man of no greater calling or possessions, was mockingly called Fishers Folly, and a Rithme was made of it, and other the like in this manner; Kirkebies Castle, and Fishers Folly, Spinilas Pleasure, and Megses glorie, and so of other such like buildinges about the Citie. From Fishers Folly vp to the West end of Hogge Lane, which commeth from the barres without Aldegate, as is afore shewed, is a continuall building of tenements, with alleyes of cottages, pestered, &c.

Where besides the ornamentes of the Church, and goods pertayning to the Hospitall, there was found standing one hundreth and fourescore beddes, well furnished for receipt of the poore of charitie: for it was an Hospitall of greate reliefe.

Edmonde the Bishop: and Mary Magdalen remaineth also one fayre builded house of two stories in height for the Mayor and other honorable persons, with the Aldermen and Sheriffes to sit in, there to heare the Sermons preached vpon Easter holy dayes. In the loft ouer them, the Ladies and Aldermens wiues doe stand at a fayre window or sit at their pleasure. And here it is to be noted, that time out of minde, it hath bin a laudable custome that on good friday in the after noone some especial learned man by appoyntmēt of y• prelats doth preach a sermon at Paules crosse, treating of Christs passion. And vpon the three next Easter holidayes, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, the like learned men by the like appointment doe vse to preach on the fore noon at the said Spittle, to perswad the articles of Christs resurrection, and then on low Sō
                  day before noon one other learned man at Paules crosse is to make rehersall of those fowre former sermons, either commending or reprouing them, as to him by iudgment of the lerned diuines is thought conuenient: And that done he is to make a sermon of himselfe, which in all were fiue Sermons in one. At these Sermons so seuerally preached, the Maior with his Brethren, the  Aldermen are accustomed to be present in their Uiolets at Paules, on Good Friday, and in their Scarlets, both they and their wiues, at the Spittle in the Holy daies (except Wednesday in Uiolet) and the Maior with his Brethren, on Low Sunday in Scarlet, at Paules Crosse. Touching the antiquitie of this custome, I finde none other, then that in the yeare, 1398. the 22. of Richard the second: that the king hauing procured from Rome, confirmation of such statutes, and ordinances, as were made in the Parliament, (begunne at Westminster, and ended at Shreusbery, he caused the same confirmation to be read and pronounced at Pauls Crosse, and at S.

Olde monumentes of the Romaines found, I finde also that the aforesaide house, wherein the Maior and Aldermen do sit at the Spittle, was builded for that purpose, of the goodes, and by the Executors of Richard Rawson Alderman and Isabell his wife, in the yere 1488. In the yere 1594. this Pulpit being old, was taken downe, and a new set vp: and the Preachers face turned towardes the south, which was before towardes the west, also a large house on the east side of the saide Pulpit, was then builded for the gouernors and children of Christes Hospitall to sit in: and this was done of the goodes of William Elkens Alderman, late deceased, but within the first yere, the same house decaying, and like to haue fallen, was againe with great cost repayred at the Cities charge. On the east side of this Churchyarde lieth a large fielde of old time called Lolesworth, now Spittle fielde: which aboute the yeare 1576. was broken vp for clay to make bricke, in the digging whereof many earthen pottes called Vrnae, were found full of ashes, and of brent bones of men, to wit of the Romaines that inhabited here: for it was the custome of the Romaines to bren their dead, to put their ashes in an vrna, and then to bury the same, with certaine ceremonies in some field appointed for that purpose, neare vnto their Citie: euery of these pots had in them with the ashes of the dead, one peece of Copper money, with the inscription of the Emperour,  then raigning: some of them were of Claudius, some of Vespasian, some of Nero, of Anthonius Pius, of Troianus: and others besides those vrnas, many other pots were there founde, made of a white earth with long nockes, and handles, like to our stone Iugges: these were emptie, but seemed to bee buried full of some liquid matter long since consumed and soaked through: for there were found diuers vials and other fashioned glasses, some most cunningly wrought, such as I haue not seene the like, and some of Christall, all which had water in them, nothing differing in clearenes, tast, or sauour from common spring water: some of these glasses had oyle in them very thicke, and earthie in sauour, some were supposed to haue balm in them, but had lost the vertue: many of those pots and glasses were broken in cutting of the clay: so that few were taken vp whole: there were also found diuers dishes and cups of a fine red colored earth, which shewed outwardly such a shining smothnesse, as if they had beene of curral, those had in the bottomes Romaine letters printed, there were also lampes of white earth artificially wrought with diuers antiques aboute them, some three or foure Images, made of white earth, aboute a span long, each of them: one I remember was of Pallas, the rest I haue forgotten, I my selfe haue reserued amongst diuers of those antiquities there found, one pot of white earth very small, not exceeding the quantitie of a quarter of a wine pint, made in shape of a Hare, squatted vpon her legs, and betweene her eares is the mouth of the pot: there hath also beene found in the same fieldeTroughes of stone found in the Spittle fielde. diuers coffins of stone, contayning the bones of men: these I suppose to be the burials of some especiall persons, in time of the Britons, or Saxons, after that the Romaines had left to gouern here: moreouer there were also found the sculs and bones of men without coffins, or rather whose coffines (being of great timber) were consumed: diuers great nailes of iron were there found, such as are vsed in the wheeles of sh

But to set downe what I haue obserued, concerning this matter, I there behelde the bones of a man lying as I noted, the heade North, the feete South, and round about him, as thwart his head along both his sides, & thwart his feete, such nayles were found, wherefore I coniectured them to bee the nayles of his Coffin, which had béene a trough cut out of some great tree, and the same couered with a planke, of a greate thicknesse, fastened with such nayles: and therefore I caused some of the nayles to be reached vp to me, and found vnder the broade heads of them, the old wood, skant turned into dust or earth, but still retayning both the grane, and the proper colour, of these nayles with the wood vnder the head thereof, I reserued one as also the nether iaw bone of the man, the teeth being very greate

                   sound and fast fixed, which (amongst other many monumentes there found) I haue yet to shew: but the nayle lying drie is now by skaling greatly wasted. And thus much for this part of Bishopsgate warde without the gate: for I haue in another place spoken of the gate, & therefore I am now to speake of that other part of this warde, which lyeth within the gate.
               And first to begin on the left hand of Bishopsgate streete, from the gate yee haue certaine Tenementes of olde time pertayning to a Brotherhood of S. Nicholas, granted to the parish Clarkes of London, for two Chaplens to be kept in the Chapple of S. Mary Magdalen neare vnto the Guilde hall of London, in the 27. of Henry the sixt, the first of these houses towardes the North & against the wall of the Citie, was sometime a large Inne or court called the Wrastlers (of such a signe) and the last in the high stréet towardes the South, was sometime also a fayre Inne called the Angell of such a signe: amongst these saide Tenementes was on the same streete side a fayre Entry or Court to the common hall of the saide parish Clarkes,Clarkes hall and their Almes houses in, Bishopsgate streete. with proper Almeshouses seauen in number, adioyning for poore parish Clarkes, and their wiues, their widdowes, such as were in greate yeares not able to labour. One of these by the saide Brotherhoode of parish Clarkes was allowed sixeteene pence the weeke, the other six had each of them nine pence the weeke, according to the pattent thereof graunted.  This Brotherhoode amongst other being suppressed. In the raigne of Edward the sixt, the saide Hall with the other buildinges there, was giuen to Sir Robert Chester a knight of Cambridge shier, against whome the parish Clarkes commencing suite, in the raigne of Queene Marie, and being like to haue preuailed, the saide Sir Robert Chester pulled downe the hall, sold the Timber, stone, and lead, and thereupon the suite was ended. The Almeshouses remaine in the Queenes handes, and people are there placed, such as can make best frendes: some of them taking the pension appointed, haue let foorth their houses for great rent, giuing occasion to the Parson of the parish to challenge tithes of the poore, &c. Next vnto this is the small parish church of S. Etholburge virgin,

               Cornhill VVarde.
               THe next ward towardes the south, is Cornhill warde,Cornhill ward so called of a corne market, time out of mind there holden, and is a part of the principall high streete, beginning at the west end of Leaden hall, stretching downe west on both the sides by the south end of Finckes lane, on the right hand, and by the North ende of Birchouers lane, on the left part of which lanes, to wit, to the middle of them is of this ward and so down to the Stockes market, and this is the bounds of this Ward. The vpper, or East part of this Warde, and also a part of Lymestreete warde hath beene (as I saide) a market place, especially for Corne, and since for all kinde of victuals, as is partly shewed in Limestreete warde, yet it appeareth of record, that in the yere 1522. the Rippars of Rie and other places solde their fresh fish in Leaden hall market, vpon Cornhil, but forren Butchers were not admitted, there to sel flesh  til the yere 1533. & shortly after it was enacted, that the said Butchers
& other should sel their beefe and mutton by weight,Fleshmarket at Leadenhal and alteration of prices in a short time. to wit beefe not aboue a halfpennie the pound, and mutton halfpenny half farthing: which act being deuised for the great commodity of the realme, (as it was then thought) hath since proued far otherwaies, for before that time a fat oxe was solde at London, for sixe and twentie shillings 8.
                     •
                  . at the most, a fat Wether for thrée shillings 4. pence, a fat Calfe the like price, a fat Lambe for twelue pence, peeces of beefe weighed two poundes and a halfe, at the least, yea thrée pound or better for a pennie on euerie Butchers stal in this Citie: and of those peeces of beefe thirteene or foureteene for twelue pence, fat mutton for eight pence the quarter, and one hundred weight of beefe for foure shillinges eight pence at the dearest: What the price is now, I néede not to set downe, many men thought the same to raise in price: by meane that euerie Grasier knew or supposed what weight euery their beastes contayned, and so raising their price thereafter, the Butcher could be no gayner, but by likewise raising his price: but the true causes of enhansing the prices both of those and other victualls are not to bee disputed here. &c. The Forren Butchers for a long time stoode in the high streete of Limestreete warde, twise euerie weeke vz. Wednesday and Saturday, and were some gaine to the Tennantes before whose dores they stoode, and into whose houses they set their blockes and stalles, on the north side of that streete, but that aduantage being espied, they were taken into Leaden hall, there to pay for their standinges to the Chamber of London. Thus much for the market vppon Cornhill.
               
               The chiefe ornamentes in Cornhil warde are these. First at the East end thereof, in the middle of the high streete, and at the parting of foure wayes, haue ye a water standarde, placed there in the yeare 1582. in manner following.
               A certaine German of Dutch man borne, named Peter Morris, hauing made an Artificiall Forcier, for that purpose, conueyed Thames water in pipes of Lead,Standarde of Thames water by Leaden hall. ouer the steeple of S. Magnus Church, at the north end of London bridge, and from thence into diuers mens houses, in Thames streete, New fish streete and Grassestreete, vp to the northwest corner of Leaden hall, the  highest ground of al the Citie,The highest ground of the Citie of London. where the wast of the maine pipe rising into this Standarde (prouided at the charges of the Citie) with foure spoutes runneth foure waies, plentifully seruing to the commoditie of the inhabitantes neare adioyning in their houses, and also clenseth the Channels of the streete towardes Bishopsgate, Aldegate, the Bridge, and the Stockes market.
               Then haue ye a fayre Conduite of swéete water, castellated in the middest of that warde and streete. This Conduite was first builded of stone, in the yeare, 1282. by Henry Walles, Maior of London, to be a prison for night walkers, & other suspitious persons, and was called the Tunne vpon Cornhill,
                  The Tunne vpon Cornhill a prison house because the same was builded somewhat in fashion of a Tonne standing on the one end.
               Also without the West side of this Tunne, was a fayre wellA fayre well vpon Cornhil. of springing water, curbed round with hard stone. In the yeare 1298. certaine principall Citizens of London, brake vp this prison called the Tunne, and tooke out certain prisoners for the which they were sharply punished by long imprisonment, & great fines, as in another place I haue shewed.
               In the yeare 1401. this prison house called the Tunne was made a Cesterne for sweete water conueyed by pipes of Leade frō the towne of Tyborne, and was from thence forth called the conduite vpon Cornhill:
                  Conduite vpō Cornhill. Then was the wall planked ouer, and a strong prison made of Timber, called a Cage, with a payre of stockes set vpon it, on the top of which Cage was placed a Pillory for the punishment of Bakers offending in the Assise of Breade: for Millers stealeing of Corne at the Mill: and for baudes and scolds &c.Cage, stockes and pillorievpon Cornhill. In the yeare 1475. R. Drope Mayor, dwelling in that warde inlarged the Cestern of this Conduite, with an east end of stone, and lead castelated in comely manner. In the yeare 1546. Sir Martin Bowes Maior dwelling in Lombard streete, and hauing his backe gate opening into Cornhill against the saide Conduite,Conduite vpō Cornhil enlarged. minded to haue enlarged the Cesterne thereof with a west end, like as Robert Drope before had don toward the East: view and measure of the plot was taken, for this worke, but the Pillorie and Cage being remoued, they found the ground planked, and the well aforesaide (worne out of memorie) which  well they reuiued and restored to vse, they set the Pillorie somewhat west from the well, and so this worke ceased.
               On the North side of this street, from the East vnto the West haue ye diuers fayre houses for marchantes and other, amongst the which one large house is called the Wey house, where marchandizes brought from beyond the seas, are to bée weighed at the Kinges Beame:The way house or kinges Beame vpon Cornhil. This house hath a maister, and vnder him foure maister Portars, with Portars vnder them: they haue a strong cart, and were vsed to haue foure great horses, to draw and carrie the wares from the marchants houses to the beam & backe again: now thrée horses serue the turn. Sir Thomas Louel

               Then haue yée the saide Finckes lane, the southende of which lane on both the sides is in Cornhill warde.
               Then next is the Royall Exchange erected.The Burse vpon Cornhill, or the Royall Exchange. In the yere 1566. after this order, vz. certaine houses vpon Cornhill, and the like vpon the backe thereof, in the warde of Brodestreete, with thrée Allies, the first called Swan Alley,Swan Alley. opening into Cornhill, the second called New Alley,New Alley. passing throughout of Cornhil into Brodstreete warde, ouer against S.

                  . to such persons as shoulde take them down, and carrie the stuffe from thence, also the ground or plot was made plaine at the charges of the Citie,The Citie charged with buildinges of the Burse. and then possession thereof was by certaine Aldermen, in name of the whole Citizens giuen to Sir Thomas Gresham knight, Agent to the Queenes Highnesse, thereupon to builde a burse, or place, for Marchantes, to assemble in, at his own proper charges: and bee on the seuenth of Iune laying the first stone of the foundation, being Bricke, accompanied with some Aldermen, euery of them laide a peece of gold, which the workemen tooke vp, and forthwith followed vpon the same with such diligence, that by the moneth of nouember in the 1567. the same was couered with slate, & shortly  after fully finished. In the yere a thousand fiue hundred seauentie on the 23. of Ianuarie, the Queenes Maiestie,Queene Elizabeth cam to the Burse. attended with her Nobillitie, came from her house at the Strande called Sommerset house, and entred the citie, by Temple Bar, through Fléetestreete, Cheape, and so by the North side of the Burse, to Sir Thomas Greshams in Bishopsgate streete, where she dined, after dinner her Maiestie returning through Cornhill entered the Burse on the southside, and after that shee had viewed euery part therof aboue the ground, especially the Pawne, which was richlie furnished with all sortes of the finest wares in the City: she caused the same Burse by an Herralde and a Trompet to bee proclamed the Royall Exchange, and so to bee called from thence forth and not otherwise.
               Next adioyning to this Royall ExchangeThe Burse called the Royall Exchange. remaineth one parte of a large stone house, and is now called the Castle of such a signe, at a Tauerne dore there is a passage throughout of Cornhill, into Thrée needle streete, the other parte of the saide stone house was taken downe, for enlarging the Royall Exchange: this stone house was saide of some to haue béene a Church (whereof it had no proportion,) of others a Iewes house (as though none but Iewes had dwelt in stone houses) but that opinion is without warrant: for in the first yeare of Richarde the first, to preuent the casualties of fire (which often had hapned in the Citie, when the houses were builded of Timber,The cause of stone houses builded in London. and couered with Reede or Straw, Henry Fitz Alewin being Maior, it was decreed that from thencforth no man should build within the Citie, but of stone, vntill a certaine height, and to couer the same building with slate, or brent tyle, and this was the verie cause of such stone buildinges, whereof many haue remained till our time: but of late for winning of ground, they haue béen taken down, & in place of some one of thē being low, as but two stories aboue the ground, many houses of foure or fiue stories high are placed.
               From this stone house down to the Stockes, are diuers large houses especially for height, for Marchantes and Artificers.
               On the south side of this high streete is the parish church of S. Peter vpon Cornhill,Parish Church of S. Peter vpō Cornhil. which seemeth to be of an ancient building: but yet not so ancient as some reporteth, for it hath béene all lately  repayred, if not new builded, except the steeple, which is ancient: the roofe of this Church, and glasing was finished in the raigne of Edwarde the fourth, as appeareth by Armes of Noble men, and Aldermen of London then liuing, there remaineth in this Church a table wherein it is written, I know not by what authority, but of a late hand, that king Lucius founded the same Church, to bee an Archbishops sea, and made it the Metropolitane, and chiefe Church of his kingdome, and that it so endured the space of foure hundred yeares, vnto the comming of Augustine the Monke.
               
                  Ioceline of Furneis writeth, that Thean the first Archbishop of London, in the raign of Lucius, builded the saide Church by the aide of Ciran, chiefe Butler to king Lucius, and also that Eluanus the second Archbishop, builded a LibraryLibrary of S. Peters vpon Cornhill now a Grammar schoole. to the same church adioyning, and conuerted many of the Druides, learned men in the Pagan law to Christianitie. True it is that a Library there was pertaining to this Parish Church of old time builded of stone, and of late repayred with Bricke, by the Executors of Sir Iohn Crosbie Alderman, as his Armes on the south ende doth witnes.
               This Library hath béene of late time, to wit, within these fifety yeares well furnished of bookes, Iohn Leyland

Notwithstanding before that time, a Grammar schoole had beene kept in this Parish as appeareth, in the fiue and twentie of Henry the sixt, it was enacted by Parliament, that foure Grammar schoolesGrammar schooles

But of late yeares greatlie blemished by the building of foure  Tenementes on the North side thereof towardes the streete, in place of a gréene churchyarde, whereby the church is greatly darkened, and otherwise annoyed, the faire new stéeple or bell Tower was begunne to be new builded in the 1421. which being finished, and a faire ring of fiue belles therein placed. One Russe a Draper gaue a sixt Bell, which he named Russe after his owne name, to be nightly rung at eight of the clocke: which bell vsually rong by one man more then 100. yeares, of late ouer hayled by 4. or 5. at once, hath beene thrice broken, and therefore not rong as heretofore.

Michael which he had lately purchased, of Aluery Randolph of Badlesmeer in Kent: but the parish neuer had the gift (nor heard thereof by the space of 40. yeares after) such was the conscience of the executors to conceale it to themselues, and such is the negligence of the parishioners (that being informed thereof) make no claime thereunto. Philip Gonter that was Alderman for a time, and gaue 400. pound to be discharged thereof, was buried in the cloyster about the yeare 1482. and Anne his wife &c.
               This parish church hath on the south side thereof a proper cloister, and a fayre church yarde, with a pulpet crosse, not much vnlike to that in Paules Churchyarde. Sir Iohn Hudstone Mayor, caused the same in his life time to be builded, and hee deceased, 1531. and was buried in a vawlt vnder the said pulpet crosse,Pulpet crosse in S.

               Then haue ye Burcheouers lane,Burcheouers lane. so called of Birchouer, the first builder and owner thereof, now corruptly called Birchen lane, the North halfe whereof is of the said Cornehill warde, the other part is of Langborne ward.
               This lane and the high streete neare adioyning hath beene inhabited for the most parte with wealthy Drapers from Birchouers lane on that side the stéete downe to the Stockes: in the raigne of Henry the sixt, had ye for the most parte dwelling Fripperers or Upholders,Vpholders sellers of olde stuffe in Cornhill. that solde olde apparell and housholde stuffe.
               I haue read of a countrey man, that then hauing lost his hoode in Westminster Hall, founde the same in Cornehill hanged out tobe solde, which he challenged, but was forced to buy, or go  without it, for their stall (they said) was their market.

               Others say, this was king Iohns house, which might so be, for I find in a written copie of Mathew Paris his historie, that in the yeare 1232. Henry the third sent Hubert de Burgho Earle of Kent, to CornehillHubert de Burgho Earle of Kent sent to Cornehill. in London, there to answere all matters obiected against him, where he wisely acquited himselfe.

                  LAngborne wardeLangborne warde, and sennie about. is so called of a long borne of swéete water, which of old time breaking out into Fenchurch streete, ran downe the same streete and Lombard street, to the West ende of S. Mary Woolnothes Church, where turning south, and breaking it selfe into many small shares, rilles or streames, it left the name of Share borne lane, or south borne laneShareborne or southborne lane. (as I haue read) because it ranne south to the riuer of Thames. This Warde beginneth at the West end of Aldegate warde, in Fenne church stréet, by the Ironmongers hall, which is on the North side of that stréete, at a place called Culuer alley,Culuer alley. Lane stopped vppe. where sometime was a lane, through the which men went into Limestréete, but that being long since stopped vp for suspition of theeues, that lurked there by night (as is shewed in Limestreet warde) there is now this said alley a tennis court, &c.

               In the midst of this streete standeth a small parish church called S. Gabriel Fen church, corruptly Fan church.

               Then haue ye Lombard streete,Lombard streete. so called of the Longobards, and other merchantes, straungers of diuers nations assembling  there twise euery day, which manner continued vntill the 22. of December in the yeare 1568. on which day the saide marchantes beganne their meeting in Cornehill at the Burse, since by her Maiestie named the Royall Exchange.
               On the North side of this Warde is Limestreet,Limestreet. one halfe whereof is of this warde, and therein on the west side is the Pewterers hall,Pewterers hall who were admitted to be a brotherhood, in the 13. of Edward the fourth.
               At Limestreet corner is a faire parish Church of S. Dionys called Back church, lately new builded: Iohn Darby Alderman about the yeare 1446. added therevnto a faire Ile or Chappell on the south side and was there buried: about the yere 1466. he gaue (besides sundry ornaments) his dwelling house, & others, vnto the said parish Church,Parish church of S.

               Then in Lombardstreet is one faire parish church, called Alhallowes
                  Parish church of Alhallowes in Lombardstreet. Grasse Church in Lombardstreet, I so reade it in euidences of record, for that the Grasse market went downe that way, and was there kept, but the street was far larger in breadth. This Church was lately new builded. Iohn Warner armorer and then Grocer Sheriffe 1494. builded the South Ile, his sonne Robert Warner Esquire finished it the yeare 1516.L. Trinitate. The Pewterers were benefactors towards the North ile &c. The steeple or bell Tower thereof was finished in the yeare 1544. about the thirty and sixt of Henry the eight. The faire stone porch of this church was brought from the late dissolued Priorie of S. Iohn of Ierusalem, by Smithfielde, so was the frame for their belles, but the belles being bought, were neuer brought thether, by reason that one olde Warner Draper, of that parish deceasing, his sonne young Marke Warner would not performe what his father had begunne, and appointed, so that faire steeple hath but one bell, as Friers were wont to vse. The monuments in this church be these,  the said Warners and Iohn Waldon Draper.
               Next to this is the parish church of S. Edmond
                  Parish church of S. Edmond in Lombard street. the King and Martir in Lombard stréet, by the south corner of Birchouers lane.
               This church is also called S. Edmond Grasse church, because the said Grasse market came downe so low. The monuments in this church are these: Sir Iohn Milborne Draper Mayor deceased, 1535. buried there by Dame Ioane, & Dame Margaret his wiues, vnder a tombe of touch. Humfrey Heyford, Goldsmith Mayor, 1477. Sir William Chester Draper, Mayor, 1560. with his wiues amongst his predecessors. Sir George Barne Mayor, 1586. &c.

               The south side of this Warde, beginneth in the East, at the chaine to be drawne thwart Mart lane, vp into Fen church stréet, and so West, by the North end of Minchen lane to S. Margarets Pattens stréet, or Roode lane, and downe that stréet to the midway toward S. Margarets church: then by Philpot lane,Philpot lane.

Buttolph is no great thing, notwithstanding diuers strangers are there harbored as may appeare by a presentment, not many yeres since made of strangersThe number of strangers. inhabitants in the warde of Billinsgate in these wordes. In Billinsgate ward were one and fifty householdes of strangers, whereof thirty of these househouldes inhabited in the parrish of S. Buttolph in the chiefe and principall houses where they giue twenty pound the yeare for a house lately letten, for foure marks, the nearer they dwell to the waterside, the more they giue for houses, and within thirty yeares before there was not in the whole warde aboue thrée Netherlanders, at which time there was within the saide parish leauied for the helpe of the poore, seauen and twentie pounde, by the yeare, but since they came so plentifully thether, there cannot  be gathered aboue eleuen pound, for they will not contribute to such charges as other Citizens doe. Thus much for that south side of this warde.
               On the north side is Bosse Alley,Bosses alley and the Bosse of Billinsgate. so called of a Bosse of spring water continually running, which standeth by Billinsgate, against this Alley, and was sometimes made by the Executors of Richard VVhitington.
               
               Then is S. Mary hill lane,S. Mary hil lane which runneth vp North from Billinsgate, to the end of S. Margaret Pattens, commonly called Roode lane, and the greatest halfe of that lane is also of Billinsgate warde. In this S. Marie hil

               This church hath been lately builded, as may appeare by this that followeth. Richarde Hackney one of the Sheriffes in the yeare 1322. and Alice his wife were there buried, as Robert Fabian writeth, saying thus. In the yeare 1497. in the moneth of Aprill, as laborers digged for the foundation of a walle, within the Church of S.

               This lane on both sides is furnished with many fayre houses for Marchantes and hath at the North end thereof, one other  lane called S.

At which time William Gascoyne, chiefe Iustice required the Mayor and Aldermen, for the citizens, to put them in the Kings grace: whereunto they answered that they had not offended, but (according to the law) had done their best in stinting debate, and maintayning of the peace: vpon which answere the king remitted all his ire, and dismissed them. And to proue this Eastcheape, to be a place replenished with cookes, it may appeare by a song called London  licke pennie, made by Lidgate the Monke of Berrye, in the raigne of Henry the fift, in the person of a cuntreyman comming to London, and trauelling through the same: In westcheapeIn west cheap linnen cloth sold but no silkes spoken of.

Michaels

Michael in Crooked lane. was somtime but a smal & homely thing, standing vpon part of that ground, wherein now standeth the parsonage house: and the ground there about was a filthy plot, by reason of the butchers in East chepe, who made the same their Laystall.

                  Praise of Wiliam Walworth for his manhood in aresting of Wat Tylar. being a man wise, learned, and of an incomparable manhood arrested Watt Tiler a presumptuous rebell, vpon whom no man durst lay  whereby hee deliuered the King and kingdome from most wicked tiranie of Traitors. The MayorThe Mayor was well armed, and had on his head a Basonet. arrested him on the head with a sound blow, whereupon Wat Tylar furiously stroke the Mayor with his dagger, but hurt him not, by reason he was well armed: the Mayor hauing receyued his stroke, drew his basiliarde, and grieuously wounded Wat in the neck, and withal gaue him a great blow on the head: in the which conflict an Esquire of the kinges house, called Iohn Cauendish drew his sword, and wounded Wat twise or thrise euen to the death: and Wat spurring his horse, cried to the commons to reuenge him: the horse bare him about 80. foot from the place, and there he fell downe halfe dead, and by and by they which attended on the king enuironed him about, so as hee was not seene of his company: many of them thrust him in in diuers places of his bodie, and drew him into the Hospitall of S. Bartholomew, from whence againe the Mayor caused him to bee drawne into Smithfield, and there to be beheaded. In rewarde of this seruice, (the people being dispersed) the king commanded the Mayor to put a Basenet on his head, and the Mayor requesting why he should so do, the king answered, he being much bound vnto him would make him knight: the MayorMayor made knight and otherwise rewarded. answered, that hee was neither worthy nor able to take such estate vpon him, for hee was but a Marchant & had to liue by his marchandise onely: notwithstanding the king made him to put on his Basenet,Order of making a knight for seruice in the field. and then with a sword in both his hands he strongly strake him on the neck as the manner was then, and the same day hee made thrée other citizens knights, for his sake in the same place: to wit, Iohn Philpot, Nicholas Brembar, and Robert Launde Alderman.Aldermen knighted.

                  It hath also beene and is nowe growne to a common opinion, that in reward of this seruice done, by the said William Walworth against the rebell. King Richard added to the armes of this Cittie (which was argent, a plaine crosse Gulas) a sword or dagger, (for so they terme it) whereof I haue read no such record, but rather that which soundeth to the contrary:Dunt
                        •
                     orne. For I finde that in the fourth yeare of Richard the second in a full assembly made in the vpper chamber of the Guildhall, summoned by this VVilliam Walworth, then Mayor, as well of Aldermen as of the common counsaile in euery ward, for certaine affaires concerning the king, it was there by common consent agreed and ordayned, that the old seale of theOld seale of the Mayoralty broken, and a new seale made. office of the Maioraltie of the citie being very smal, old, vnapt, & vncomely, for the honor of the city, should be broken, & one other new should be had, which the said Mayor commanded to be made artificially, & honorable for the exercise of the said office therafter in place of the other: in which new seale, besides the images of Peter, and Paule, which of olde were rudely engrauen, there should be vnder the feet of the said images, a shield of the armes ofThe armes of this cittie were not altered, but remaine as afore. the said cittie perfectly graued, with two Lyons supporting the same with two sergeants of arms, an other parte, one & two tabernacles, in which aboue should stand two angels, between whom aboue the said images of Peter and Paule shall be set the glorious Uirgine: this being done, the old seale of the Office was deliuered to Richard Odiham Chamberlaine, who brake it, and in place thereof, was deliuered the new seale to the said Mayor to vse in his office, of maioraltie, as occasion should require. This new seale seemeth to be made before W. Walworth was knighted, for he is not here intituled Sir, as afterwardes he was: and certaine it is that the same new seale then made, is now in vse and none other in that office of the Maioraltie: which may suffice to answere the former fable, without shewing of any euidence sealed with the olde seale, which was the crosse and sword as now &c.

                  On the north side of this church and churchyard is one faire and large builded house, sometime pertaining to the Prior of Tortington
                  Prior of Tortington his Inne. since that to the Earles of Oxford,

                  Empson and Dudley. knight dwelled in the one of them, & Edmond Dudley Esquire in the other: eyther of them had a dore of entercourse into this garden, wherein they met & consulted of matters at their pleasures. In this Oxford place Sir Ambrose Nicholas kept his mayoralty, & since him y• said Sir Iohn Hart did likewise.
               On the south side of this high street, neare vnto the channell, is pitched vpright a great stone called London stoneLondon stone. fixed in the ground very deep, fastned with bars of iron, & otherwise so strong lie set, that if cartes do runne against it through negligence, the Wheeles be broken, and the stone it selfe vnshaken.
               The cause why this stone was there set, the verie time when, or other memory hereof, is there none, but that the same hath long continued there, is manifest, namely since (or rather before) the time of the conquest: for in the ende of a fayre written Gospell booke giuen to Christes church in Canterburie, by Ethelstane king of the west Saxons, I finde noted of Landes or Rentes in London belonging to the saide church, whereof one parcell is described, to ly neare vnto London stone.
                  
                     Liber Trinitate Antiquity of London stone. Of later time wee reade that in the yeare of Christ 1135. the first of king Stephen a fire which began in the house of one Ailwarde, neare vnto London stone consumed all east to Ealdegate, in the which fire the Priorie of the holy Trinitie was brent, & west to S. Erkenwalds shrine in Paules Church: and these be the eldest notes that I read therof.
               Some haue saide this stone to haue beene set, as a marke in the middle of the cittie within the walles: but in truth it standeth farre nearer vnto the riuer of Thames, then to the wall of the city, some others haue saide the same to bee set for the tendering and making of paymentes by debtors to their creditors, at their appointed daies, and times, till of later time, paymentes were more vsually made at the font in Pontes church, and now most commonly at the Royall Exchange, some againe haue imagined the same to bee set vp by one Iohn or Thomas Londonstone dwelling there against, but more likely it is, that such men haue  taken name of the stone, rather then

On the east side of this streete and at the north corner thereof, is the stockes market, which had this beginning. Aboute the yeare of Christ 1282. Henry Wales Maior, caused diuers houses in this Citie to be builded towardes the maintenance of London bridge, namely one voide place neare vnto the parish church, called Woole church, on the north side thereof, where sometime (the way being very large and broade) had stoode a payre of stockes,Stockes market. for punishment of offendors, this building tooke name of these stockes, and was appointed by him, to bee a market place for fish and flesh in the midst of the city, other houses he builded in other places, as by the patent of Edward the first, it doth appeare dated the 10. of his raign. After this in the yeare 1322. the 17. of Edwarde the second a decree was made by Hamond Chickwell Maior, that none should sell fish or flesh out of the markets appointed, to wit Bridge streete,The middest of the Citie. East cheape, Olde fishstreete, S. Nicholas shambles, and the said Stocks vpon pain to forfeite such fish or flesh as were sold, for the first time, and the second time to loose their freedom, which act was made by commandemēt of the king vnder his letters patents dated at the Tower, the 17. of his raign, and then was this stockes let to ferme for six and fortie pound thirteene shillinges foure pence by the yeare. This Stockes market was again begunne to be builded in the yeare 1410. in the 11. of Henry the 4. and was cleane finished in the yeare next following.Robert Fabian. In the yeare 1543.

This Tronage or weighing of WoolTronage or weighing of wooll caused the church to bee named Wool church haw. till the sixt of Richard the secōd, was there continued, and vntill that Iohn Churchman builded the custome house vpon Woolkey, to serue for the said Tronage, as is before shewed in the Towerstreete warde: This church is reasonable fayre and large, and was latelie new builded, by licence granted in the 20. of Henry the sixt, with condition to bee builded 15. foote from the Stockes market for sparing of light to the same.

               Lower downe from this parish church bee diuers fayre houses namely one wherein of late Sir Richard Baker a knight of Kent was lodged, and one wherein dwelled maister Thomas Gore a marchant famous for Hospitality. On the West side of this Walbrooke streete, ouer against the Stockes market, is a parte of the high streete, called the Poultrie, on the south side west, till ouer against S. Mildredes Church, and the Skalding Wike, is of this warde. Then downe againe Walbrooke stréete some small distance, is Buckles Bury, a streete so called of Buckle
                  Buckles bery, that sometime was owner thereof, part of which streete, on both sides 3. or 4. houses to the course of the Brooke is of this warde, and so downe Walbrooke streete, to the south corner: from whence west downe Budge Row, some small distance to an Alley  and through that Alley south by the west ende of S. Iohns church vpon Walbrooke, by the south side, and east end of the same, again to Walbrooke corner. This parrish church is called S. Iohn vpon Walbrooke, because the west ende thereof is on the verie banke of Walbrooke, by Horshew Bridge,Horshew bridge. a Bridge ouer the Brooke in Horsebridge lane. This church was also lately new builded: for aboute the yeare 1412. licence was granted by the Maior, and Comminalty, to the Parson and Parish there, for the enlarging thereof, with a peece of ground on the north part of the Quire, 21. foot, in length, 17. foot, in bredth, & 3. inches, & on the south side the Quire, one foot of the common soyle: There bee no monuments in this church of any account, onely William Combarton Skinner, who gaue lands to that church, was there buried, 1410. and Iohn Stone Taylor one of the Sheriffes 1464. was likewise buried there. On the south side of Walbrooke warde from Candlewicke streete, in the mid way betwixt London stone, and Walbrooke corner, is a little lane with a turnepike in the middest thereof, and in the same a proper parish church called S. Mary Bothaw,
                  Parish church of S.

Within this Church, and the small Cloistrie adioyning, diuers noble men and persons of worship haue beene buried, as appeareth both by Armes in the windowes, by the defaced Tombes, and printe of plates torne vp and carried away, there remaine onely, of Iohn West Esquier, buried there in the year 1408.

This warde turneth into Thames street westwarde, some ten houses on a side, to the course of Walbrooke but east in Thames streete, on both sides to Ebgate or old swan, and ouer against Cbgate the land side hath many lanes turning, as shal be shewed, but first, to begin with the high streete called Dowgate at the vpper end thereof, is a fayre Conduite of Thames water, castellated, and made in the yeare 1568, at charges of the Citizens, and is called the Conduit vpon Downgate.Conduite vpon Downgate. The descent of this streete, from the said Conduite to the watergate, called Downgate, is such that in the yere 1574. on the fourth of September in the afternoon there fell a storme of raine, where through the channels suddenly arose, and ran with such a swift course towards the common Shores, that a lad of 18. yeres oldA lad of 18. yeares olde drowned in the chennell

On the west side of this streete, is the Tallow Chandlers hall, a very proper house, which Companie was incorporated in the second yeare of Edwarde the fourth. Somewhat lower standeth the Skinners hall, a very fayre house, also which was sometime called Copped hallCopped hall now Skinners hall. by Downgate in the parish of S, Iohn vppon Walbrooke. In the 19. yeare of Edwarde the second, Ralph Cobham possessed it with fiue shops, &c.

Henry the thirde, in the 44. of his raigne, at the request of his brother Richarde Earle of Cornwell, king of Almaine, granted that all and singular the marchantes, hauing a house in the Citie of London, commonlie called Guilda Aula Theutonicorum,

Edwarde the first renewed and confirmed that Charter of Liberties, granted by his Father. And in the tenth yeare of the same Edward, Henry Wales being Maior, a great contreuersie did arise betweene the saide Maior, and the marchantes of the Haunce of Almaine, about the reparations of Bishopsgate then likely to fall, for that the saide marchantes enioyed, diuers Priuiledges, in respect of maintayning the saide gate, which they now denied to repaire: for the appeasing of which controuersie the king sent his writ to the Treasurer, and Barons of his Exchequer, commanding that they should make inquisition thereof, before whom the marchants being called, when they were not able to discharge themselues, sith they inioyed the liberties to them granted, for the same, a precept was sent to the Maior, and Sheriffes, to distraine the saide marchantes, to make the reparasions, namely Gerard Marbod Alderman of the Hance, Ralph, de Cussarde a Citizen of Collen,  Ludero de Deneuar, a Burges of Triuar, Iohn of Aras, a Burges of Triuon, Bart

Thus much for their priuiledges: whereby it appeareth that they were great marchants of corne brought out of the east parts hether, in so much that the occupiers of husbandry in this lande were enforced to complaine of them for bringing in such aboundance, when the corne of this realme was at an easie price: wherevpon it was ordayned by parliamentAct of Parliament for corn brought from beyond seat. that no person shoulde bring into any part of this realme, by way of merchandise, any wheate, Rie, or Barlie, growing out of the said realme at any time, when then the quarter of wheat exceeded not the price of vj.

These merchants of the Haunce had their Guildhall in Thames stréet in place aforesaid, by the saide Cosin lane. Their hall is large builded of stone with three arched gates towardes the stréet, the middlemost whereof is far bigger then the other, & is seldome opened, & the other two be mured vp, the same is now called the old hall.
               Of later time to wit, in the 6. of Richard the 2. they hired one  house next adioyning to their old hall, which sometime belonged to Richard Lions a famous Lapidary, one of the Sheriffes of London in the 49. of Edward the 3. & in the 4. of Richard the 2. by the rebels of Kent, drawne out of that house, and beheaded in West Cheape: this also was a great house with a large wharfe on the Thames, and the way thereunto was called Windgoose or Wildgoose lane,Windgoose lane. which is now called Windgoose alley, for that the same alley is for the most part builded on by the stilyard marchants.
               The Abbot of S. Albons had a messuage heere with a Key giuen to him in the 34. of Henry the 6. Then is one other great house which sometime pertained to Iohn Reynwel Stockfishmonger Mayor, and it was by him giuen to the Mayor, and communaltie to the end that the profits thereof should be disposed in déedes of pietie: which house in the 15. of Edward the fourth, was confirmed vnto the said marchants in manner following vz.Pattent. It is ordayned by our soueraigne Lord and his parliament, that the said merchantes of Almaine, being of the company called the Guildhall Teutonicorū, that now be or hereafter shal be, shal haue hold and enioy to them and their successors for euer, the said place called, the stele house, yéelding to the Mayor and communalty an annual rent of 70. pound, 3. shillings, foure pence, &c.

               Then is church lane,Church lane. at the west end of Alhallows church called Alhallowes the moreParish church of Alhallowes the more. in Thames stréet, for a difference from Alhallowes the lesse in the same stréete: it is also called Alhallowes ad foenum in the Ropery, because hay sold néere thereunto at hey wharse, and of ropes of olde time made or solde in the high street. This is a faire church with a large cloyster on the South side thereof about their churchyard, but foulely defaced & ruinated. The church also hath had many faire monuments, but now defaced: there remayneth in the quire some plates on graue stones on these persons, namely of William Lichfield, Doctor of Diuinity, who deceased the yeare 1447. he was a great student, and compiled many books both morall and diuine, in prose and in verse, namely one intituled the complaint of God vnto sinfull man. He made in his time 3083. sermons, as appeared by his own hand writing,  and were founde when hee was dead. One other plate there is of Iohn Brickles Draper, who deceased in the yere 1451. he was a great benefactor to that church, and gaue by his testament certaine tenements, to the reliefe of the poore &c. At the East ende of this church goeth downe a lane, called hey wharfe lane,Hey wharfe lane. now lately a gret brewhouse was builded there by one Pot: Henry Campion Esquire, a Béere brower vsed it, & so doth Abraham his sonne now possesseth it. Then was there one other lane sometime called Wolses gate,Welsey lane. now out of vse, for the lower part thereof vpon the bank of Thames is builded vpon by the late Earle of Shrewsbury, and the other end is builded on and stopped vp by the Chambarlaine of London. Iohn Butler Draper one of the Sheriffes in the yeare 1420. dwelled there: he appointed his house to be sold and the price therof to be giuen to the poore, it was of Alhallowes parish the lesse. Then is there the said parish church of Alhallows
                  Parish church of Alhallowes the lesse. called the lesse, and by some Alhallowes on the sellers, for it standeth on vaults: it is said to be builded by Sir Iohn Poultney sometimes Mayor, the stéeple and quire of this Church standeth on an arched gate, being the entry to a great house called Colde Harbrough:Cold Harbrough. the quire of late being fallen down, is now again at length in the yere 1594. by the parishioners new builded. Touching this Cold Harbrough, I find that in the 13. of Edward the 2. Sir Iohn Abel knight, demised or let vnto Henry Stow Draper all that his capitall messuage called the Colde Harbrough in the parish of Alsaints ad foenum, and all the purtenances within the gate, with the key which Robert Hartford citizen, sonne to William Hartford had, and ought, and the foresaid Robert paid for it the rent of 33.

                     , and Maude maried to Sir Stephen Cosenton knightes, betwéene whom the said house and lands were parted. After the which Iohn Bigot sonne to the said Sir Raph, and Sir Iohn Cosenton didsel their moities of Cold Harbrough vnto Iohn Poultney son of Adam Poultney the 8. of Edward the thirde. This Sir Iohn Poultney dwelling in this house, and being foure times Mayor, the said house tooke the name of Poultneyes Inne. Notwithstanding this Sir Iohn Poultney the 21. of Edward the 3.  by his charter gaue and confirmed to Humfrey de Bohume earle of Hereford and Essex, his whole tenement called Colde Harbrough, with all the tenements and key adioyning, & apurtenances sometime pertayning to Robert de Hereford, on the way called Hey wharfe lane &c. for one Rose at Midsomer, to him and to his heires for all seruices, if the same were demanded. This Sir Iohn Poultney deceased 1349. and left issue by Margaret his wife, William Poultney, who died without issue, and Margaret his mother was maried to Sir Nicholas Louell knight &c. Phillip. S. Cleare gaue two messuages pertaining to this Cold Harbrough, in the Ropery, towards the inlarging of the parish church, and churchyard, of All saynts, called the lesse in the 20. of Richard the 2. In the yeare 1397. the 21. of Richard the 2. Iohn Holland Earle of Huntington was lodged there, and Richard the 2. his brother dined with him, but in the next yere following I find y• 
                  Edmond Earle of Cambridge had this house & was there lodged in the yeare 1398. notwithstanding the said house stil retained the name of Poultneyes Inne, in the raigne of Henry the 6. the 26. of his raigne, and not otherwise. It belonged fithence to H. Holland Duke of Excester, and hee was lodged there in the yeare 1472. In the yeare 1485. Richard the third by his letters Pattents granted and gaue to Iohn Writh, alias Garter, principall king of Armes of English men, and to the rest of the kinges Herralds and Pursiuantes of armes, all that messuage with the apurtenances, called Cold Erber in the parish of All saints, the little in London, and to their successors for euer.

Cuthbert Tunstal Bishop of Durham, was lodged there, since the which time it hath belonged to the earls of Shrewsbury, by composition (as is supposed) from the saide Cuthbert Tunstall.

Next is Suffolke lane,Suffolke lane. likewise turning vp to Candlewicke street, in this lane is one notable Grammer schoole, founded in the yeare 1561. by the maister, wardens and assistants of the Merchantaylors,Marchantaylors schoole. in the parish of Saint Laurence Poultney. Richard Hilles somtime maister of that company, hauing before giuen 500. pound towards the purchase of an house, called the Mannor of the Rose,The mannar of the Rose. sometime belonging to the Duke of Buckingham, wherin the said schoole is kept.

The cookes dressed meate, and sold no wine, and the Tauerner sold wine, and dressed no meat for sale &c. This warde beginneth in the East, at the west end of Downgate ward, as the water course of Walbrooke parteth them, to wit at Granthams lane, on the Thames side, and at Elbow lane on the lande side: it runneth along in Thames stréete west, some thrée houses beyond the old Swan, a Brewhouse on the Thames side, and on the land side some thrée houses west, beyond S. Iames at Garlicke Hith. In breadth this ward stretcheth from the Uintrie North to the wall of the West gate of the Tower Royall: the other North part is of Cordwayner stréete Warde. Out of this Royall streete by the South gate of Tower Royall runneth a small stréete, east to S. Iohns vpon Walbrooke, which stréete is called Horshewbridge,Horshewbridge street. of such a bridge sometime ouer the brooke there, which is now vaulted ouer. Then from the said south gate west, runneth one other stréete, called Knightriders stréete,Knightriders street. by S.

Stephen at Westminster: notwithstanding in the raigne of Richarde the 2. it was called the Queenes Wardrope, as appeareth by this that followeth: king Richarde hauing in Smithfielde ouercome and dispersed his Rebels, hee, his Lordes and all his Companie, entred the Citie of London, with great ioy, and went to the Lady PrincesseThe Lady Princes lodged in the Tower Royal. his mother, who was then lodged in the Tower Royall, called the Queenes Wardrope where shee had remained three daies, and two nightes, right sore abashed: but when shee saw the king her sonne, shee was greatlie reioyced and saide. Ah sonne, what greate sorrow haue I suffered for you this day. The king answered and saide, certainely Madam, I know it well, but now reioyce and thanke God, for I haue this day, recouered mine heritage, and the Realme of England which I had neare hand lost.
               This Tower seemeth to haue beene at that time of good defence, for when the Rebels had beset the Tower of Lo

I read that in the yeare 1386. Lyon king of Armonie, being chased out of his Realme, by the Tartarians, receiued innumerable giftes of the King,King Richard lodged in the Tower Royall and of his Nobles, the king then lying in the Royall: where hee also granted to the said king of Armonie, a Charter of a thousand poundes by yeare during his life, this for proofe may suffice, that kinges of England haue beene lodged in this Tower, though the same of later time hath beene neglected, and turned into stabling, for the kinges horses, and now letten out to diuers men, and deuided into Tenementes. In Horsebridge streete, is the Cutlers hall,Cutlars hall. which sometime belonged to Simon Dolesley Grocer Maior, in the yeare 1359, they of this Company, were of olde time deuided into three artes, or sortes of Workemen, to wit, the first were Smithes, Forgers of Blades, and therefore called Bladers, and diuers of them prooued welthie men, as namelie, Walter Nele, Blader,Bladers or BladeSmithes one of the Sheriffes, the 12, of Edwarde the thirde, deceased 1352. and buried in S.

Iohn Warde, VVilliam Pierson Scriuener, and Atturney in the common place. In a proper Chappel on the south side the church standeth a tombe, eleuate & arched, of some vnknowne founder. Ade de Buke Hatter glased the chappell and most parte of the church, and was there buried: all other monuments be defaced. Without the North side of this church of S. Mary Bow, towards west Chepe standeth one faire building of stone, called in record Seldam, a shed,A shed or standing for the king called crowne silde. which greatly darkeneth the said church,  for by meanes thereof all the windowes and dores on that side are stopped vp: This building was made by K. Edward the third, vpon this occasion. In the raigne of the sayde king diuers iustings were made in London betwixt Sopars lane and the Crosse in Chepe:Iusting in west Cheape. for the standard stoode not then in place where now it is, namely one great iusting was there in the yeare 1330. the fourth of Edward the third, whereof is noted thus. About the feast of S. Michael there was a great and solemne iusting of all the stout Earles, Barons and nobles of the realme, at London in West Cheape, betwixt the great crosse and the great conduit, nigh Sopars lane, which iusting lasted thrée daies: where Quéene Philip with many Ladies fell from a stage of timber, notwithstanding they were not hurt at all: wherfore the Quéene tooke great care to saue the Carpenters from punishment, and through her prayer (which she made on her knées) she pacified the king and counsaile, and thereby purchased great loue of the people. After which time the king caused this silde or shede to bee made, and strongly to bee builded of stone, for himself, the Quéene, and other estates to stand in, and there to behold the iustings and other shewes at their pleasure. And this house for a long time after serued to that vse, namely in the raigne of Edward the third, and Richard the second, but in the yeare 1410. Henry the fourth, in the 12. of his raigne, confirmed the said shed, or building, with all shops, sellers, and edifices whatsoeuer appertaining, called Crounsilde
                  Croundsilde. (and in the 8. of the same H. called Tamarside) situate in the Mercery in west Chepe, in the parish of S. Mary de Arcubus in London, and a certaine shop in the said parish, betweene the same shed and the kings high way of west Cheape, annexed to the said shed, with two shops, sellers and edifices whatsoeuer, as well builded, or any way being ouer the said shop, as ouer the entry of the said shed, which were holden of him in burgage, as all the Cittie of London is, and which were worth by yeare in all issues, according to the true value of them, vij.pound xiij.

Notwithstanding which graunt the kings of England, and other great estates, as wel of forrein countries repayring to this realme, as inhabitantes of the same, haue vsually repaired to this place, therein to behold the shewes of this Citie, passing through West  Cheape, namely the great watches accustomed in the night, on the euen of S. Iohn Baptist, and S. Peter at Midsommer, the examples wherof were ouer long to recite, wherefore let it suffice briefly to touch one. In the yeare 1510. the 2. of Henry the eight,K. Henry the eight came in the likenesse of a yoman of his guard, to the kings head in Cheap on S. Iohns euen at night, the king came to this place, then called the kings head in Cheape, in the liuerie of a yoman of the garde, with an halberd on his sholder, (and there beholding the watch) departed priuily, when the watch was done, and was not knowne to any but to whom it pleased him, but on S. Peters night next following, hee and the Quéene came royally riding to the said place, and there with their nobles beheld the watch of the Citie, and returned in the morning. This church of S. Mary, with the saide shede of stone, all the housing in or about Bowe Church yard, & without on that side the high stréet of Cheape to the standarde be of Cordmayner stréet warde. These houses were of old time but shedes: for I read of no housing otherwise on that side the stréete, but of diuers shedes from Sopars lane to the standard, &c. Amongst other I reade of thrée shops or shedes, by Sopars lane pertaining to the Priorie of the holy Trinity within Aldegate: the one was let out for 28.

               NExt adioining is Chepe warde,Cheape ward. which also beginneth in the East, on the course of Walbrooke, in Buckles bury, and runneth vp on both the sides to the great Conduit in Cheape. Also on the south syde of Buckles  berie a lane turning vp by S. Sithes Church, & by S. Pancrates church, through Needlers lane, on the north side thereof, and then through a péece of Sopars lane, on both sydes vp to Chepe, be all of Chepe warde. Then to be begin againe in the east vpon the said course of Walbrooke, is S. Mildreds church in the Poultrie, on the north side, and ouer against the said church gate, on the south to passe vp al that high stréet called the Poultrie, to the great conduit in Chepe, and then Chepe it selfe, which beginneth by the east end of the said Conduit, and stretcheth vp to the North East corner of Bow lane, on the south side, and to the standard on the North side, and thus far to the west is of Cheape ward. On the south side of this high stréet is no lane turning south out of this ward, more thē some small portion of Sopars lane, whereof I haue before written. But on the North side of this high stréete is Conyhope lane, about one quarter of Olde Iurie lane, on the west side and on the East side almost as much to the signe of the Angell. Then is Iremongers lane, all wholly on both sides, and from the North end thereof through Catton stréete, West to the North ende of S. Laurence lane, and some 4. houses west beyond the same on that side, and ouer against Ironmongers lane end on the North side of Catton stréete vp by the Guildhal, and S. Laurence church in the Iurie is altogether of Chepe ward. Then againe in Chepe more toward the west is S. Laurence lane before named, which is all wholly of this warde, and last of all is Hony lane, and so vp to the standard on that North side of Chepe: and so stand the boundes of Chepe ward.
               Now for antiquities there, first is Buckles berie, so called of a mannor, and tenementes pertayning to one Buckle,
                  Buckles bury of one Buckle. who there dwelled, and kept his courts. This Mannor is supposed to be the great stone building, yet in parte remaining on the south side the stréete, which of late time hath beene called the old Barge, of such a signe hanged out neare the gate thereof. This Mannor or great house hath of long time béene diuided and letten out into many tenements: and it hath béene a common speech that when the WalbrookeBarges towed vp Walbrook vnto Buckles berie. did l
                     •
                  e open, barges were rowed out of the Thames, or towed vp so far, and therefore the place hath euer since béene called ye Old barge, Also on the north side of this stréet directly ouer against the said Buckles berie was one ancient and strong tower of stone  the which king Edwarde the thirde in the 32. of his raigne, did grant to his Colledge or free Chappell of S. Stephen at Westminster, by the name of his Tower called Seruesse Tower atSeruice Tower by Walbrook Buckles bery: this Tower of late yeares was taken downe, by one Buckle a Grocer, meaning in place thereof to haue set vppe and builded a goodly frame of Timber, but the saide Buckle greedily labouring to pull downe the olde Tower, a peece thereof fell vpon him which so brused him that his life was thereby shortened, and an other that married his widdow, set vp the newly prepared frame of tymber, and finished the worke.
               This whole streete called Buckles bury on both the sides throughout, is possessed of Grocers and Apothecaries toward the west ende thereof, on the south side, breaketh out one other short lane called in recordes Peneritch streete,Penerich streete. it reacheth but to Saint Sythes lane, and S. Sythes
                  Parish church of S. Syth or Bennit shrog. Church is the farthest part thereof, for by the west ende of the saide Church beginneth Needelars lane,Needelars lane which reacheth to Sopars lane as is aforesaide, this small parish Church of S. Sith hath also an addition of Bennet shorne (or Shrog, or Shorehogge) for by al these names haue I read it, but the auncientest is Shorne, wherefore it seemeth to take that name of one Benedict Shorne, sometime a Cittizen, and Stockefishmonger of London, a new builder, repayrer or Benefactor therof, in the raigne of E. the second, so that Shorne is but corruptlie called Shrog, and more corruptly Shorehog.
               There lye buried in this Church Richard Lincolne Felmonger, 1548. Iohn Fresh Mercer Maior 1394. Iohn Rochforde and Robert Rochforde, Iohn Holde Alderman, Henry Froweke, Mercer Maior, a thousand foure hundred thirty fiue Edward Warrington, Iohn Morrice, Iohn Huntley, Sir Ralph Waren Mercer Maior, 1553, Sir Iohn Lion Grocer Maior, 1554. these two last haue monumentes, the rest are all defaced.

Then is a part of Sopars lane turning vp to Cheape, by the assent of Stephen Abunden, Maior, the Peperars in Sopars lane were admitted to sell all such spices, and other wares, as Grocers now vse to sell, retayning the olde name of Peperars in Sopars lane,Pepperars in Sopars lane. till at length in the raign of Henry the sixt the same Sopars lane was inhabited by Cordewainers and Curriars, after that the Peperars or Grocers had seated themselues in a more open streete, to wit in Buckles bury, where they yet remaine. Thus much for the south wing of Cheapeward.

This Conduite was the first sweete water that was conueyed by pipes of lead vnder ground, to this place in the Citie, from Padington it was castellated with stone and cesterned in lead which was begunne in the yeare  1285. Henry Wales being then Maior. This Conduite was againe new builded by Thomas Ilame one of the Sheriffes in the yeare, 1479. beyond this Conduite, on the south side of Cheap be now faire and large houses, for the most part possessed of Mercers vp to the north corner of Cordwainer streete, corruptlie called Bow lane, which houses in former time were but shedes (or shops) with solars ouer them, as of late one of them remained at Sopars lane end, wherein a woman sold seedes, rootes, and herbs, but those sheddes or shops, by incrochmentes on the high streete, are now largely builded on both sides outward, and also vpwarde towarde heauen, some thrée, foure, or fiue stories on high. &c.
               On the north side of the Poultrie, is the proper parish churchparish church of S. Mildred of S. Mildrede, which was new builded vpon Walbrooke, in the yeare 1457.

               Of the name of this streete, called the Poultrie, I haue before spoken as also of the lane called Skalding house, or Skalding wike &c. On this north side some foure houses west from Saint Mildred church, is a prison house pertayning to one of the Sheriffes, and is called the Compter in the Poultrie, and hath beene there kept time out of minde, for I haue not read of the originall thereof. Somewhat west from this Comptar,Compter in the poultrie. was sometime a proper Chappell,Chappell of Corpus Christi. of Corpus Christi, and S. Marie, at Coniehopelane end in the parish of S. Mildrede, founded by one named Ionyrunnes, a Citizen of London, in the raigne of Edwarde the thirde, where was a Guilde or Fraternitie, that might dispend in lands better then twentie pound by yeare, it was suppressed by Henry the eight, and purchased by one Hobson, a Haberdasher, who turned this Chappell into a fayre warehouse, and shops towardes the streete, with lodginges ouer them. Then is Conningshop lane,Cony hope lane. of olde time so called of a signe of three Conies, hanging ouer a Poulters stall at the lane ende. Within this lane standeth the Grocers hall,Grocers hall. which Companie being of olde time called Peperars, were first incorporated by the name of GrocersGrocers hall first purchased and then builded by the Grocers. in the yeare 1345, at which time they elected for Custos or Gardian of their Fraternitie, Richarde Oswine, and Lawrence Halliwel, and twentie Brethren were then taken in, to be of their scocietie.
               In the yeare 1411. the Custos or Gardian, and the Brethren of this Companie, purchased of the Lord Robert Fitzwaters, one plot of ground with the building thereupon in the saide Conyhope  lane for 320. markes, and then laide the foundation of their new common hall.
               About the yeare 1429. the Grocers had licence to purchase 500. markes land, since the which time neare adioyning vnto the Grocers hall, the said Company hath builded seauen Almes houses,Seauen Almeshouses by the Grocers hall. for seauen aged poore Almes people. Thomas Knoles Grocer Maior, gaue his Tenement in S. Anthonines Churchyard, to the Grocers, towards the releef of the poore Brethren in that Companie, also Henry Keeble Grocer Maior, gaue to the seauen Almes people six pence the peece weekelie for euer, which pension is now increased by the Maisters to some of them, two shillinges the peece weekelie, and to some of them lesse &c.
               West from this Conyhope lane is the olde Iury, whereof some portion is of Cheape warde, as afore is shewed. At the south ende of this lane, is the Parish church of S, Mary Colechurch,

Without this lane is the Standarde in Cheape,Standarde in Cheape. which Iohn Wels Grocer Maior 1430. caused to be made with a small Cesterne for fresh water, hauing one Cocke continually running, when the same is not turned nor lockt, this was finished by his Executors. Thomas Knoles, and Iohn Chichley they purchased licence of Henry the sixt, to conuey water, to make the Conduite, now whether the Standarde in West Cheape so oft spoken of in former times, be the same and stoode iust in this place, or elswhere, or that the same were remoueable, may bee some question: for it is manifest that in the raigne of Edwarde the thirde, and at other times when the great iustinges, and other running on horsebacke were practised betwixt the great Crosse, and the great Conduite at Sopars lane end, there was no such Standarde, or other Obstacle betweene them, neither was that streete paued with hard stone as now it is, we read that in the yeare 1293, three mē had their right hands striken off at the Standard in Cheap,Men executed in west Cheap for rescuing of a Prisoner, it is verie likelie therefore that the olde Crosse in Cheape (which was then newlie builded) was also the Standarde.
               In the yeare 1326. the Citizens tooke VValter Stapleton Bishop of Excester and beheaded him with other at the Standarde in Cheape: In the yeare 1399. King Henry the fourth caused the Blanch Charters made by Richarde the second, to bee  burnt at the Standarde in West Cheape. In the yeare 1381. Wat Tylar be headed Richarde Lions and others in Cheape. In the yeare 1461. Iohn Dauie had his hand striken off at the Standarde in Cheape, also Iacke Cade the Rebell beheaded the Lorde Say at the Standarde in Cheape, &c. Thus much for the Body of Cheape warde may suffice.

The foundation of the Maiors court was laide in the thirde yeare of the raigne of Henry the sixt, and of the Portch on the South side of the Maiors court, in the fourth of the saide king. Then was builded the Maiors Chamber,  and the counsell chamber, with other roomes aboue the staires: last of all a stately porch entering the great hall was erected, the front thereof towards the south, being beautified with images of stone, such as is shewed by these verses following, made about some 30. yeares since, by William Elderton, at that time an Atturney in the Sheriffes courtes there.

Now for the Chappell or Colledge of our Ladie Mary Magdalen, and of All-saintes by the Guildhall,Chappell or Colledge at Guildhal. called London Colledge, I reade that the same was builded about the yeare 1299. And in a Recorde I find that Peter fanelore, Adam Frauncis, and Henry Frowike Citizens gaue one Messuage with the apurtenances in the parish of Saint Fawstar 
                   to William Bramton Custos of the Chauntrie, by them founde in the said Chappell, with foure Chaplens, and one other house in the parish of S. Giles without Criplegate, in the 27. of Edward the third, which was about the yeere 1353. Moreouer I finde that Richard the 2. in the 20. of his raigne, graunted to Stephen Spilman, Mercer, licence to giue one messuage, 3. shops, and one garden, with the apurtenances, being in the parish of S. Andrew Hubbard, to the Custos and chaplens of the said chappell, and to their successors for their better reliefe and maintenance for euer.
               King Henry the 6. in the eight of his raigne gaue licence to Iohn Barnard Custos, and the chaplens to builde of new the saide chappell or colledge of Guildhall, and the same Henry the 6. in the 27. of his raigne, graunted to the parish Clearkes in London & Guilde of S.

This chappell or colledge had a Custos, 7. chaplens, 3. clearkes, and foure Queristers.
               Monumentes there haue béene sundry, as appeareth by the tombes of marble yet remaining, seuen in number, but all defaced. The vppermost in the quire on the South side thereof aboue the Reuestrie dore, was the tombe of Iohn Welles
                  Iohn Wels a principall benefactor to Guildhall colledge. Grocer Mayor, 1431. The likenes of welles are grauen on the tombe, on the Reuestrie dore, and other places on that side the Quire. Also in the Glasse window ouer this tombe, and in the East window is the likenesse of welles, with handes eleuated out of the same welles, holding scrowles, wherein is written Mercy, the writing in the East window being broken yet remayneth Welles. I founde his armes also in the South glasse windowe, all which do shewe that the East ende and South side the Quire of this chappell, and the Reuestrie were by him both builded and glased: on the North side the Quire the tomb of Thomas Kneseworth Fishmonger Mayor 1505. who deceased 1515. was defaced, and within these 44. yeares againe renewed by the Fishmongers: two other tombes lower there are, the one of a Draper, the other of a Haberdasher, their names not knowne: Richard Stomine is written by in the  window by the Habardasher, vnder flat stones do lie diuers Custos of the Chappell, chaplens & officers to the chamber.

               Adioyning to this chappell on south side was sometime a fayre and large librarie,Librarie at Guildhal. furnished with bookes, pertaining to the Guildhall and colledge: These bookes (as it is said) were in the raigne of Edward the 6. sent for by Edward Duke of Sommerset, Lord Protector, with promise to be restored shortly: men laded from thence thrée Carriers with them, but neuer returned. This librarie was builded by the executors of R. Whittington, and by William Burie: the armes of Whittington are placed on the one side in the stone worke, and two letters, to wit, W. and B. for William Burie, on the other side: it is now lofted through, and made a store house for clothes. Southwest from this Guildhall, is the faire parish church of S. Laurence
                  Parish church of S. Laurence in the Iury. called in the Iunie, because of olde time since the raigne of William Conqueror (that first brought Iewes from Roan into this realme) many Iewes inhabited there about, vntill that in the yeare 1290. the 18. of Edward the first they were wholly and for euer by the said king banishedThe Iewes banished England, the number of them. The tooth of some monstrous fish, as I take it. this realme, hauing of their owne goodes to beare their charges, till they were out of his dominions. The number of the Iewes at that time banished were 15060. persons whose houses being sold, the king made of them a mightie masse of money. This church is faire and large, and hath some monuments, as shall bee shewed. I my selfe more then 60. yeares since haue séene in this church the shanke bone of a man (as it is taken) and also a tooth of a very great bignesse hanged, vp for shewe in chaines of Iron vppon a pillar of stone, the tooth (being about the bignesse of a mans fist) is long since conueyed from thence

               Colemanstreet Ward.
               NExt to Cheape warde on the North side thereof is Colemanstreet Ward, and beginneth also in the East, on the course of Walbrooke in Lothbury and runneth west on the South side to the end of Ironmongers lane, and on the North side to the West corner of Bassings hall stréet. On the South side of Lothburie is the stréet called the old Iurie, the one halfe and better on both sides towards Cheape is of this Ward. On the North side lyeth Colemanstreet, whereof the ward taketh name, wholly on both sides North to London wall, and from that North ende along by the wall, and Moregate East, to the course of Walbrooke. And again from Colemanstreet west to the yron grates: and these be the bounds of this warde.
               Antiquities to be noted therein are these: First the stréete of Lothberie, Lathberie, or Loadberie,Lothbery. (for by all these names haue I read it) tooke the name (as it séemeth) of Berie, or Court of old time there kept, but by whom is growne out of memorie. This stréete is possessed for the most part by Founders, that cast Candlestickes, Chafingdishes, Spice morters, and such like Copper or Laton workes, and do afterwarde turne them with the foot and not with the whéele, to make them smooth and bright with turning and scrating (as some do tearme it) making a lothsome noyce to the by passers, that haue not béene vsed to the like, and therefore by them disdainfully called Lothberie. On the South side of this stréet, amongst the Founders by some faire houses, and large for merchants, namely one that of old time was the Iewes Sinagogue,The Iewes Sinagogue. which was defaced by the citizens of London after that they had slaine 700. Iewes and spoyled the residue of their goods in the yeare 1262. the 47. of Henry the third. And not long after in the yeare 1291. King Edward the first banished the renmant of the Iewes out of England, as is aforeshewed. The said sinagogue being so suppressed certaine Friers got possession thereof: For in the yeare 1257. (saith Mathew Parris) there were séene in London a new order of Fryers, called de penitentia Iesu, or Fra
                        •
                     res de sacca,
                  Fratres de sacca or de penitentia. because they were apparelled in sackecloth, who had their house in London, néere vnto Aldersgate without the gate, and had licence of Henry the third, in the 54. of his raigne, to remoue  from thence to any other place: and in the 56. he gaue vnto them this Iewes Sinagogue: after which time Elianor the Quéene, wife to Edward the first tooke into her protection, and warranted vnto the Prior, & brethren de Penitentia Iesu Christi of London, the said lande and building in Colechurch stréeteColechurch street or Old Iurie. in the parish of S. Olaue in the Iurie, and S. Margaret in Lothbery by her granted, with consent of Stephen de Fulborne, vnder Warden of the Bridge house, & other brethren of that house for lx. marks of siluer, which they had receiued of ye said Prior & brethren of Repentance, to the building of ye said bridge. This order of friers gathered many good schollers, & multiplyed in number exceedingly, vntill the counsell at Lyons, by the which it was decréede, that from that time forth there should no more orders of begging Fryers be permitted, but only the foure orders, to wit, the Dominick or preachers, the Minorites or Gray Fryers, the Carmelites or white Fryers, and the Augustines: and so from that time the begging Friers decreased, and fell to nothing. Now it followed that in the yeare 1305. Robert Fitzwalter
                  Robert Fitzwalter his house. requested and obtained of the said king Edward the first, that the same Fryers of the Sacke might assigne to the said Robert their chappel or church, of old time called the Sinagogue of the Iewes, néere adioyning to the then mansion place of the same Robert, where now standeth the Grocers hall: and the said Sinagogue was at the North corner of the old Iurie. Robert Large Mercer, Mayor in the yeare 1439. kept his Mayoraltie in this house, and dwelled there vntill his dying day. This house standeth and is of two parishes, as opening into Lothberie, of S. Margarets parish, and opening into the old Iurie, of S. Olaues parish. The said Robert Large gaue liberally to both these parishes, but was buried at S. Olaues, Hugh Clopton Mercer Mayor, 1492. dwelled in this house, and kept his Mayoraltie there: it is nowe a Tauerne, and hath to signe a Windmill.The Windmill Tauerne in the old Iurie. And thus much for this house sometime the Iewes Sinagogue, since a house of Fryers, then a Noble mans house: after that a marchantes house, wherein Mayoralties haue beene kept, and now a wine Tauerne.
               In the Olde Iurie is a proper parish Church of S. Olaue,
                  Parish church of S. Olaue in the Iury. in which to the commendation of the parishioners, the monumentes of the deade remaine lesse defaced then in many other: First of

               From this parish church of S. Olaue, to the North ende of the Old Iurie, and from thence West to the North ende of the Ironmongers lane, and from the sayde corner into Ironmongers lane almost to the parrish Church of Saynt Marten, was of olde time one large building of stone, very auncient, but of what antiquitie, or by whom the same was builded, or for what vse I haue not learned more then that king Henry the 6. in the 16. of his raigne, gaue the office of being Porter or keeper thereof, vnto Iohn Stent for tearme of his life, by the name of his principall pallace in the olde Iurie:Kings pallace in the Old Iury. this was in my youth called the old wardrope: but of later time the outwarde stone wall hath béene by little and little taken downe, and diuers fayre houses builded therevpon, euen round about.
               Now for the North side of this Lothburie, beginning againe at the East end thereof, vpon the water course of Walbrooke haue ye a proper parish church called of S. Margaret,
                  Parish church of S. Margaret in Lothburie. which séemeth to be newly reedified and builded about the yeare 1440. for Robert Large gaue to the Quire of that church, 100. shillings and twentie pounde for ornamentes, more to the vaulting ouer the watercourse of Walbrooke by the saide church, for the inlarging thereof two hundred markes.
               
                  There be monumentes in this church of Reginald Coleman sonne to Robert Coleman buried there 1383. This saide Robert Coleman may be supposed to be the first builder and honor or Coleman stréete, and that Saint Stephens church then builded in Coleman streete was but a chappell, belonging to the parish Church of Saint Olaue in the Iury: for we reade (as afore) that Iohn Forest Uicker of Saint Olaues, and of the chappel annexed of S. Stephen, deceased in the yeare 1399. This may bee some argument, which I euerpasse.

               By the West end of this parish church haue ye a faire water Conduit,Conduit in Lothbery. builded at the charges of the cittie, in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred fortie sixe. Sir Martin Bowes being Mayor: this water is conueyed in great abundance from diuers springes without the North wall of the cittie, lying betwixt Hoxton and Iseldon.
               
               Next is the Founders Hall,The Founders Hall. a proper house, and so long West to the Southwest corner of Bassinges Hall stréete, haue ye  fayre and large houses for marchantes: namely the corner house. at the ende of Bassinges hall streete, an old peece of worke builded of stone &c. a part whereof hath beene lately imployed as a market house for the sale of Wollen, Bayes,The Bay hall.

               THe next adioyning to Colemanstreete ward on the west side thereof is Bassinges hall warde,Bassinges hall warde. a small thing & consisteth of one street called Bassinges hal streete, of Bassinges hall, the most principall house of that streete whereof the warde taketh name. It beginneth in the south by the late spoken market house called the Bay hall, which is the last house of Colemanstreete warde,  this streete runneth from thence north down to London wall, and some little distance both east and west, against the saide wall, and this is the boundes of Bassinges hall warde.

                  Henry the 1. my Grandfather, so that none but they intermit within the citie of their craft but hee bee of their Guilde, neither in Southwarke or other places pertayning to London, otherwise then it was done in the time of king Henry my Grandfather: wherfore I will and straightly command that ouer all lawfully, they may treat, and haue all aforesaide, as well in peace, free, worshipfull, and wholy, as they had it, freer, better, worshipfullier, and wholier, then in the time of king Henry my Grandfather, so that they yeeld yearelie to mee two markes of gold, at the feast of S. Michaell, and I forbid that any man to them do any vnright, or disease, vpon pain of ten pound witnes Thomas of Canterbury, Warwicke fili Gar. Chamberlaine at Winchester.
                  Patent Also I read that the same Henry the second in the 31: of his raigne, made a confirmation to the Weauers that had a Guilde or Fraternitie in London, wherein it appeareth that the saide Weauers made wolen cloth, and that they had the correction thereof, but amongst other Articles in that patent, it was decreede, that if any man made cloth of Spanish wooll, mixed with English Wooll, the Port graue, or principall magistrate of London ought to burne it, &c.
               Moreouer in the yeare 1197. king Richarde the first atMathew Paris. the instance of Hubert Archbishop of Canterbury and Iusticiar of England ordeyned that the wollen clothes in euery part of this realme should be in bredth two yards within the listes and as good  in the middest as in the sides &c. King Henry the thirde granted to the citizens of London that they should not be vexed, for the burels, or clothlisted, according to the constitution made for bredth of cloth, the ninth of his raigne, &c.
               Lower downe is the Girdlars hall, and this is all touching the east side of this ward.Girdlars hall.
               
               On the west side almost at the south end thereof is Bakewel hall, corruptlie called Blackewell hall,Bakewell hall. concerning the originall whereof I haue heard diuers opinions, which I ouerpasse as fables, without colour of truth, for though the same seemed a building of great antiquitie, yet in mine opinion the foundation thereof was first laide since the Conquest of VVilliam Duke of Normandy: for the same was builded vpon vaultes of stone, which stone was brought from Cane in Normandy, the like of that of Paules Church, builded by Mauritious and his successors Bishops of London: but that this house hath beene a Temple or Iewish Sinagogue (as some haue fantasied) I allow not, seeing that it hath no such forme of roundnes, or other likenesse, neither had it the forme of a Church, for the assembly of Christians which are builded East and West, but contrariwise the same was builded North and South, and in forme of a noble mans house, and therefore the best opinion in my indgement is that, it was of olde time belongiug to the family of the Bassinges,
                  Bassinges hall. which was in this Realme, a name of great antiquitie and renowne, and that it bare also the name of that family, and was called therefore BassingesArmes of the Bassinges Haugh, or Hall: whereunto I am the rather induced, for that the Armes of that family were of olde time so abundantlie placed in sundry partes of that house, euen in the stone worke, but more especially on the walles of the hall, which carried a continuall painting of them on euery side so close together, as one escutcheō could be placed by another, which I my selfe haue often seene and noted before the old building was taken downe: these Armes were a Gerond of twelue pointes, golde and azure. Of the Bassinges
                  How Bassings hall warde tooke that name: therefore builders of this house, and owners of the ground, neare adioyning, that warde taketh the name, as Coleman street warde of Coleman, and Faringden warde of VVilliam and Nicholas Faringden, men that were principall owners of those places.
               And of olde time the most noble persons that inhabited this  Citie, were appointed to be principall magistrates there, as was Godfrey de Magun (or Magnauile) Portgraue or Sheriffe, in the raign of William Conqueror, and of William Rufus, Hugh de Buch, in the raigne of Henry the first, Aubery de vere Earle of Oxforde, after him Gilbert Becket, in the raigne of king Stephen, after that Godfrey de Magnauile the sonne of William the sonne of Godfrey de Magnauile Earles of Essex, were Portgraues or Sheriffes of London, and Middlesex. In the raigne of Henry the second, Peter Fitzwalter: after him Iohn Fitznigel
&c. so likewise in the raigne of king Iohn, the 16. of his raigne, a time of great trobles in the yeare 1214. Salomon Bassing,
                  Sallomon Bassing and other of that name. and Hugh Bassing, Barons of this Realme, as may be supposed were Sheriffes: and the saide Salomon Bassing was Maior in the yere 1216. which was the first of Henry the thirde, also Adam Bassing sonne to Salomon (as it seemeth) was one of the Sheriffes in the yeare 1243. the 28. of Henry the thirde.
               Unto this Adam de Bassing, king Henry the thirde in the 31 of his raigne gaue and confirmed certaine messuages in Alderman bury, and in Milke streete (places not far from Bassinges hall) with the aduowson of the Church at Bassinges hal, with sundrie liberties and priuiledges.
               This man was afterwardes Maior in the yeare 1251. the 36. of Henry the thirde, moreouer Thomas Bassing was one of the Sheriffes, 1269. Robert Bassing Sheriffe, 1279. and William Bassing was Sheriffe 1308. &c. for more of the Bassinges in this Citie I need not note, onely I read of a branch of this family of Bassinges, to haue spread it self into Cambridge 
                     •
                  hire, near vnto a water or bourne, and was therefore for a difference from other of that name, called BassingBassing borne at the bourn, and more shortly Bassing borne. But this family is also worne out, and hath left the name to the place, where they dwelt. Thus much for this Bassinges hall.
               Now how Blakewell hallBakewel hall giuen to the Citie. tooke that name is an other question: for which I reade that Thomas Bakewell dwelled in this house, in the six and thirteth of Edwarde the thirde, and that in the 20. of Richarde the second, the saide king for the summe of fifty poundes which the Maior and Comminaltie had paide into the Hanapar granted, licence so much as was in him  to Iohn Frosh, William Parker, and Stephen Spilman (Citizens and Mercers) that they, the saide messuage, called Bakewell hal, and one garden with the appurtenances in the parish of S. Michaell of Bassings haugh, and of S. Lawrence in the Iury of London, and one messuage, two shops, and one Garden, in the saide parish of S. Michaell, which they held of the king in burgage, might giue and assigne to the Maior and Comminaltie for euer.
               This Bakewell hallBakewell hal a market place for wollen clothes. thus established, hath beene long since imployed as a weekelie market place, for all sortes of Wollen clothes broade and narrow, brought from all parts of this Realme, there to be solde. The which house of late yeares growing ruinous and in danger of falling, Richarde May Marchant Taylor at his decease gaue towardes the new buildingBakewell hall new builded. of the outward part thereof 300. pound
                     •
                  s vpon condition that the same should be performed within three yeres after his decease, whereupon the olde Bakewell hal, was taken downe, and in the moneth of February next following, the foundation of a new strong & beutifull Store house being laide, the worke thereof was so diligently applied that within the space of ten monethes after, to the charges of fiue and twentie hundred poundes, the same was finished in the yeare 1588.
               Next beyond this house be placed diuers fayre houses for marchantes and others, till yee come to the backe gate of Guild hall, which gate and parte of the building within the same, is of this warde. Some small distance beyond this gate, the Coopers haue their common hall. Then is the parish church of S. Michaell.

               THe Next ward is called of Criplesgate,Criplegate Warde. and consisteth of diuers streetes and lanes, lying aswell without the gate and wall of the citie, as with in: for first within the wall on the east parte thereof, towardes the north it runneth to the west side of Bassinges hal ward: and towards the south it ioyneth to the warde of Cheape, it beginneth at the west ende of S. Lawrence church, in the Iury, on the north side and runneth west to a Pump, where sometime was a well, with two Bucketes, at the south corner of Aldermanbury streete, which streete runneth downe north to Gay spurre lane, and so to London wall, which streete and lane are wholy on both sides of this warde, and so bee some few houses on both the sides from Gay spurre lane, by and against the wall of the citie, east to the Grates made for the Watercourse of the channels, and west to Criples gate. Now on the south side from ouer against the west end of S. Lawrence church, to the Pumpe, and then vp Milke streete, south vnto Cheape, which Milkestreete, is wholy on both the sides of Cripplegate warde, as also without the South  end of Milkestreete, a part of west Cheape, to wit from the standarde to the Crosse, is all of Cripplegate warde. Then downe greate Woodstreete, which is wholy of this warde on both the sides thereof, so is little Woodstreete which runneth downe to Cripplegate.
               Out of this Woodstreete be diuers lanes, namely on the east side is Lad lane, which runneth east to Milkestreete corner, down lower in Woodstreete is Loue lane, which lyeth by the south side of S. Albons church in Woodstreete, and runneth downe to the Conduite in Aldermanbury stréete. Lower downe in Woodestreete is Addlestreete, out of the which runneth Phillippe lane, downe to London wall. These be the lanes on the east side.

               Now for Antiquities and Ornamentes in this warde, meete to be noted: I finde first at the meeting of the corners of the olde Iury, Milkestreete, Lad lane, and Aldermanbury, there was of olde time a fayre well with two buckets, of late yeares conuerted to a Pumpe,A pumpe at the corner of Aldermanbury streete. how Aldermanbury streete tooke that name, manie fables haue beene bruted, all which I ouerpasse as not worthy the accounting, but to be short and plaine, I say that this streete tooke the name of Aldermans bury (which is to say a court) there kept in their Bery, or Court hall, now called the Guildehall, which hall of olde time stoode on the East side of the same streete not far from the west end of Guild hall now vsed. Touching the antiquitie of this old Aldermans bery or court, I haue not read other then that Richarde Renery one of the Sheriffes of London, in the first of Richarde the first, which was in the yeare of Christ 1189. gaue to the church of S. Mary at Osney,
                     Liber Osney. Aldermanbery court or Guild hal by Aldermanbury church. by Oxforde, certaine ground and rents in Aldermanbury of London, as appeareth by the Register of that Church, and is also entred in the Hoistinges of the Guild hall in London: this old Bery court or hal continued
& the courts of the Maior & Aldermen were continually holden there vntil the new Bery court or Guild hal that now is was builded and finished, which hall was first begun to be founded in ye yeare 1411. and was not fully finished in 20. yeares after, I myselfe haue seene the ruines of the old Court hall in Aldermanbury street which of late hath been imployed as a Carpenters yard &c.
               In this Aldermanbury streete bee diuers fayre houses on both the sides, meete for marchantes or men of Worship, and in the middest thereof is a fayre conduite made at the charges of VVilliam Eastfielde, sometime Maior, who tooke order aswell for water to be conueyed, from Teyborne, and for the building of this Conduite not far distant from his dwelling house, as also for a Standarde of sweet water, to be erected in Fleetestreete, all which was don by his executors, as in another place I haue shewed  Then is the parish Church of S.

This bone is said to bee found amongst the bones of men remoued from the charnell house of Paules, or rather from the Cloyster of Pauls church, of both which reports I haue some doubt, for that the late Reyne Wolfe
                  Reyne Wolfe a graue antiquarie, collected the great Chronicles increased, and published by his executors. Stationer (who paid for the cariage of those bones from the charnell to the Morefields) told me of some thousands of Carrie loades and more to be conueighed, whereof hee wondred, but neuer tolde mee of any such bone in eyther place to be founde, neither would the same haue béene easily gotten from him if he had heard thereof, except he had reserued the like for himselfe, being one of the greatest serchers, and preseruers of antiquities in those parts for his time. True it is that this bone, (from whence soeuer it came) being of a man, as the forme sheweth) must needes bee monstrous, and more then after the proportion of fiue shanke bones of any man now liuing amongst vs. There lie buried in this church Simon Winchcombe Esquire 1391.

               Then next to this is Woodstréet,Woodstreet. by what reason so called I know not, true it is that of old time according to a decrée made in the raigne of Richard the first, the houses in London were builded of stone for defence of fire, which kind of building was vsed for 200. yeares or more, but of later time for the winning of ground those houses haue béene taken down, and houses of timber set vp in place. It séemeth therefore that this stréet hath béene of the later building, all of timber, (for not one house of stone hath béene knowne there) and therefore called Woodstréet, otherwise it might take the name of some builder or owner thereof.
               
                  Thomas Wood one of the Sheriffes in the yeare 1491. dwelled  was father to my louing friend William Lambarde Esquire, well knowne by sundry learned bookes that he hath published. Iohn Medley Chamberlain of London, Iohn Marsh Esquire Mercer and common Sergeant of London &c. There is also (but without any outward monument) the head of Iames the fift king of Scots of that name, slaine at Flodden field, and buried here by this occasion.Iames the fift king of Scots his head buried in S. Michaels church in Woodstreet. After the battaile the bodie of the said King being founde, was closed in lead, and conueyed from thence to London, and so to the Monasterie of Sheyne in Surrey, where it remained for a time, in what order I am not certaine: but since the dissolution of that house, in the raigne of Edward the sixt, Henry Cray Duke of Suffolke, being lodged and kéeping house there: I haue béene shewed the same bodie so lapped in lead, close of the head and bodie, throwne into a waste roome, amongst the old timber, leade, and other rubble. Since the which time workemen there for their foolish pleasure hewed off his head: and Launcelot Young at this present mayster Glasier to her Maiestie, féeling a swéet sauour to come from thence, and séeing the same dryed from all moisture, and yet the forme remayning, with the hayre of the heade, and beard red, brought it to London to his house in Woodstréet, where for a time he kept it for the swéetnesse, but in the end caused the Sexton of that church to burie it amongst other bones, taken out of their charnell &c. I reade in diuers Recordes of a house in Woodstréet then called Blacke Hall,Black hall in Woodstreet in S. Michaels parish. but no man at this day can tell thereof.
               On the North side of this S. Michaels church is Mayden lane, now so called, but of old time Ingenelane, or Inglane.Ingene lane or Mayden lane. In this lane the Waxchandlers haue their common hall on the south side thereof: and the Haberdashers haue their like Hall on the North side at Staning lane end.Waxchandlers hall. This company of the Haberdashers,Haberdashers hall. or Hurrers of old time so called, were incorporated a brotherhoode of S. Katherine, the 26. of Henry the sixt, and so confirmed by Henry the seuenth the 17. of his raigne, the Cappers and Hat Merchants or Hurrers being one company of Haberdashers.
               Downe lower in Woodstréet is SiluerstreeteSiluerstreet. (I thinke of siluer smithes dwelling there) in which be diuers faire houses, and on the North side thereof is Monkes well street,Monkes well street. so called of a well at the North end therof, where the Abbot of Garendon had an house  or Cell called S. Iames in the wall by Criplesgate, and certaine Monkes of their house were the Chaplens there, wherefore the well (belonging to that Cell or Hermitage) was called Monkes well, and the stréet, of the well, Monkes well street.
               The East side of this streete downe against London wall, and the South side thereof to Criplesgate bee of Criplesgate ward, as is afore shewed. In this street by the corner of Monks well street is the Bowyers Hall.Boyers hall.

Butolphe. on the West side, from Saint Gyles Church yard, vp to the said Crosse, be many faire houses builded outward, with diuers Alleyes turning into a large plot of ground, of olde time called the Iewes Garden:The Iewes Gardaine, or place to bury their dead. as being the onely place appointed them in England, wherin to bury their dead: till the yeare 1177. the 24. of Henry the second, that it was permitted to them (after long sute to the King, and Parliament at Oxford) to haue a speciall place assigned them in euery quarter where they dwelled.
               This plot of ground remained to the said Iewes, til the time of their finall banishment out of England, and is now turned into faire garden plots and sommer houses for pleasure.
               On the East side of this Red Crosse stréete, be also diuers faire houses, vp to the Crosse. And there is Béech Lane,Beech Lane. peraduenture so called of Nicholas de la Beeche, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, and put out of that Office in the 13. of Edward the third. This Lane stretcheth from the Red Crosse stréete, to white Crosse stréete, and is replenished, not with Béech Trées, but with beautifull houses, of stone, brick, and timber. Amongst the which, was of old time, a great house pertaining to the Abbot of Ramsey,

The East part thereof, ioyneth vnto the west part of Criplegate Ward in Engain Lane, or Maiden Lane. It beginneth on the North side of that lane, at staining Lane end, and runneth vp that Lane, from the Haberdashers Hall, to S. Mary Staining church: and by the church East, winding almost to Woodstréete. And West through Oatelane,

                   North west by the West ende of Engaine Lane, by Lilipot Lane, and Oate Lane, to Noble stréete, and through that by Shelly house (of olde time so called, as belonging to the Shelleyes) for Sir Thomas Shelley knight, was owner thereof in the 1. of Hen. the 4. It is now called Bacon house,Shelleyes house, now Bacon house. because the same was new builded by Syr Nicholas Bacon Lord Kéeper of the great Seale. Downe on that side by the Lane, by Seriant Fleetwoods house, (Recorder of London, who also new builded it) to S. Olaues Church in Siluer-stréet, which is by the Northwest ende of this Noble stréete. Then againe in Foster Lane, this Ward beginneth on the West side therof, ouer against the Southwest corner of Saint Fosters Church, and runneth downe by S. Leonards church, by Pope Lane end, and by S. Anus Lane end, which Lane is also of this Ward, North to the stone wall by the wall of the Citie, ouer against Bacon house, which is also of this Ward. Then haue ye the Maine stréete of this Ward, which is called S. Martins Lane,S. Martins Lane. which includeth S. Martin on the East side therof, and so downe on both the sides to Aldersgate.Aldersgate streete. And these be the bounds of this Ward within the wall and gate. Without the gate, the Maine stréete called Aldersgate stréete, runneth vp North on the East side, to the West ende of Hownds Ditch, or Barbican stréete: A part of which stréete is also of this Warde. And on on the West side to Longlane, a part whereof is likewise of this Warde. Beyond the which Aldersgate stréete, is Cosewell stréete vp to the Barres.
               And on this West side of Aldersgate stréet, by S. Buttolphes church, is Briton stréete, which runneth West to a Pumpe, and then North to the gate which entereth the church yard, sometime pertaining to the Priorie of S. Bartholomewe on the East side: and on the West side towards S. Bartholomewes Spittle, to a paine of postes there fixed. And these be the bounds of this Aldersgate Warde without.
               The antiquities be these, First in Staining Lane,Staining Lane Almes houses there. of olde time so called (as may be supposed) of Painter stainers dwelling there.

And sir George Baron gaue them ten pounds by the yeare for euer.
               Then is the small parrish Church of Saint Mary, called Staining,Parish Church of Saint Mary Staining. because it standeth at the North ende of Staining Lane. In the which Church being but newly builded, there remaine no Monument worth the noting.
               Then is Engaine Lane, (or Mayden Lane) and at the NorthWest corner thereof, the parish Church of S. Iohn Sachary.
                  Parish Church of Saint Iohn Sachary. A faire Church, with the Monuments well preserued, of sir Nicholas Twiford Goldsmith, Maior, 1388. and Dame Margery his wife: of whose goods ye Church was made & new builded, with a Tombe for them and others of their race, 1390.

               On the East side of this Faster Lane, at Engeyne Lane ende, is the Goldsmithes Hall,The Goldsmiths Hall. a proper house, but not large. And therfore to say that Bartholmew Read Goldsmith, Maior, in the yeare 1502.  kept such a feast in this Hall, as some haue fabuled is far incredible,R. Grasion. and altogither vnpossible, considering the smalnesse of the Hall, and number of the guests, which as they say, were more then an hundreth persons of great estate. For the Messes & dishes of meates to them serued, the paled parke in the same Hall, furnished with frutefull Trées, beasts of venery, and other circumstances of that pretended feast well weighed, Westminster Hall would hardly haue suffised, and therfore I will ouerpasse it, and note somewhat of principall Goldsmiths.
               First I reade, that Leefstane Goldsmith was Prouest of this Citie, in the raign of Henry the 1. Also that Henry Fitz Alewin, Fits Leafstane Goldsmith was Maior of London,
                  The first Maior of London was a Goldsmith. in the first of Richard the first, and continued Maior 24. yeares. Also that GregoryPrincipall men of the Citie Goldsmithes. Rocksly, chiefe say-maister of all the Kings Mintes within England, (and therefore by my coniecture) a Goldsmith was Maior in the 3. of Edward the first, and continued Maior 7. yeares togither. The William Farindon Goldsmith, Alderman of Farindon ward, one of the Sheriffes 1281. the 9. of Edward the first, who was a Goldsmith, as appeareth on record, as shall be shewed in Farindon Warde. Then Nicholas Farindon his sonne, Goldsmith, Alderman of Farindon Warde, foure times Maior in the raigne of Edward the second, &c. For the rest of later time are more manifestly known, and therefore I leaue them.

Parish church of S. Anne in the Willowes. so called of one Pope that was owner therof) on the North side, is the parish church of S. Anne, in the willowes, so called, I know not vpon what occasion: but some say, of willowes growing thereabouts: but now there is no such voide place for willowes to growe, more then the church yard, wherin do growe some high Ashe trées.
               This church by casualtie of fire, in the yeare 1548. was burnt, so far as it was Combustible, but since being newly repaired, there remain a fewe monuments of antiquitie of Thomas Beckhenton, Clarke of the pipe, who was buried there 1499.

This Colledge was surrendred to K. E. the 6. the 2. of his raigne, in the yeare 1548. and the same yeare the Colledge church was pulled down, and in place therof many houses foorthwith builded, highly prised, and letten to strangers borne, and other such as claime the benefit of ye priuiledges which were at the first granted only to ye church, and to the Deane, Prebends & Canons, seruing God according to ye foundatiō. Lower down on the west side of S. Martins lane, in the parish of S. Anne, almost by Aldersgate, is one great house, commōly called Northumberland house:Northumberland house, or Queene Ianes Wardrobe. it belonged to Hen. Percey. K.

               ON the South side of Aldersgate Warde, lyeth Faringdon Warde,Faringdon Warde within. called Infra, or within, for a difference from an other Ward of that name, which lyeth without the walles of the Citie, and is therefore called Farindon Extra.

These two Wards of old time were but one, and had also but one Alderman, til y• 17. of Richard the second. At which time the saide Warde for the greatnesse therof, was diuided into twaine, & by Parlament ordered to haue two Aldermen, and so it continueth till this day. The whole great Warde of Farindon, both Infra and Extra, tooke name of William Farendon Goldsmith, Alderman of that Warde, and one of the Sheriffes of London, in the yere 1281. the 9. of Edward the first, he purchased the Aldermanry of this Ward, as by this abstract of déeds which I haue read thereof may appeare.

                  Nicholas Farendon Alderman. sonne to the said William and to his heires: which Nicholas Farendon (also a Goldsmith) was foure times Maior, and liued many yeares after: for I haue read diuers déedes whereunto he was a witnesse, dated the yeare 1360. He made his Testament, 1361. which was 53. yeares after his first being Maior,Nicholas Farendon liued 53. yeares after hee had beene once Maior. and was buried in S. Peters in Cheape. So this Warde continued vnder the gouernment of William Faringdon the Father, and Nicholas his son, by the space of 82. yeares, and retaineth their name vntill this present day.
               This Warde of Faringdon within the walles, is bounded thus: Beginning in the East, at the great Crosse in West Cheape, from whence it runneth West. On the North side from the parish church of S. Peter, (which is at the Southwest corner of Woodstréete) vnto Guthurums Lane, and downe that Lane, to Hugon Lane on the East side, and to Kery Lane on the West.
               Then againe into Cheape, and to Foster Lane, and downe that Lane, on the East side, to the North side of Saint Fausters Church, and on the West, till ouer against the Southwest corner of the said Church, from whence downe Fauster Lane, and Noble Stréete, is all of Aldersgate stréete Warde, till ye come to the stone wall, in the West side of Noble stréete.
               Then by the said wal downe to Winsor house, (or Neuils Inne) and downe Monkes-well stréete, on that West side, and then by London wall to Criple Gate. And the West side of that same Gate is of Faringdon Warde.
               Then backe againe into Cheape, and from Fauster Lane end, to Saint Martins Lane end, and from thence through Saint Nicholas Shambles, by Penticost Lane, and Butchers Alley, and by stinking Lane through Newgate Market, to Newgate. All which is the North side of Faringdon Warde.
               Then on the South from against the said great Crosse in Cheap, West from Fridayes stréete, and downe that stréet on the East side, till ouer against the North East corner
                     •
                   of S. Mathewes Church:  and on the West side, till the South corner of the said Church.
               Then againe along Cheape to the old Exchaunge, and downe that Lane (on the East side) to the parish church of Saint Augustine, (which church and one house next adioyning in Watheling stréete, be of this Warde) and on the West side of this Lane, to the gate which entereth the South church yard of Saint Paules, and within that gate on the North side, to the Gate that entereth the North church yarde: all which North church yard is of this Faringdon Warde.
               Then againe into Cheape, and from the North end of the old Exchaunge, West by the North Gate of Powles church yarde, vp Pater Noster Rowe, by the two Lanes out of Powles church, and to a signe of the Golden Lyon, which is some twelue houses short of Aue Mary Lane: the West side of which Lane, is of this Warde.
               Then at the South ende of Aue Mary Lane, is Creed Lane: the West side whereof, is also of this Warde.
               Now betwixt the South ende of Aue Mary Lane, and the North ende of Creede Lane, is the comming out of Powles Church yarde. On the East, and the high stréete called Bowier Rowe, to Ludgate on the West side: which way to Ludgate is of this Warde. On the North side whereof, is Saint Martins church. And on the South side, the turning into the blacke Friers.
               Nowe to turne vp againe to the North ende of Aue Mary Lane, there is a short Lane which runneth West some small distance, and is there closed vp with a gate into a great house: and this is called Amen Lane.Amen Lane.
               
               Then on the North side of Pater Noster Rowe, beginning at the conduit ouer against the Olde Exchaunge Lane ende, and going west by Saint Michaels church. At the west ende of which church, is a small passage through the Church, towards the North. And beyond this church some small distance, is an other passage, which is called Paniar-Alley:Paniar Alley. and commeth out against Saint Martins Lane ende.
               Then further West, in Pater Noster Rowe, is Iuie Lane,Iue Lane. which runneth North to the west ende of Saint Nicholas Shambles. And then west Pater Noster Rowe, till ouer against the  golden Lyon, where the Warde endeth for that stréete.
               And then about some dozen houses (which is of Baynards Castle Warde) to UUarwike Lane ende: which UUarwicke Lane, stretcheth North to the high stréete of Newgate Market. And the west side of UUarwicke Lane is of this Faringdon UUarde. For the East side of UUarwick Lane, of Aue Mary Lane, and of Creed Lane, with the UUest ende of Pater Noster Rowe, are all of Baynards Castle UUarde.
               Yet (to begin againe at the said Conduit by the old Exchange) on the North side thereof, is a large stréete that runneth vp to Newgate, as is aforesaid. The first part or Southside whereof, from the conduit to the Shambles, is called Bladder stréete.Bladder stree
                        •
                     
                   Then on the backe side of the shambles, be diuers slaughter houses, and such like, pertaining to the shambles, and this is called Mount-Godard stréet.Mountgodard streete. Then is the Shambles it selfe. And then Newgate Market. And so the whole stréete on both sides vp to Newgate, is of this UUarde, and thus it is wholly bounded.
               Monuments in this UUarde, there be these. First the great Crosse in UUest cheape.Crosse in Cheape builded. But in the warde of Faringdon, the which crosse was first erected in that place, in the yeare 1291. in the 19. of Edward the first, vpon this occasion.
               Queene Elianor his wife, dyed at Herdeby (a Towne neare vnto the citie of Lincolne) her bodie was brought from thence to Westminster. And this King (in memorie of her) caused at euery place (where the bodie was staied in the way) a stately crosse of stone to be made and erected, with the Quéenes Image and Armes vpon it: as at Grantham, Woborne, Northampton, Stony Stratfoord, Dunstable, S. Albons, Waltham, West Cheape, and at Charing, from whence she was conueyed to Westminster, and there buried.
               This Crosse in west cheape, being like to those other, which remaine till this day, and being by length of time decaied, Iohn Hatherley being Maior, procured in the yeare 1441. license of King Henry the 6. in the 21. of his raigne, to reedifie the same in more bewtifull maner,Crosse in Cheape new builded. for the honor of the citie: and had also license to take vp 200. fodar of lead, for the building therof, and of certain
                     •
                   conduits, and a common Gramarie, and it was very curiously wrought,  at the charges of diuers Citizens, Iohn Fisher Mercer gaue 600. markes towards it, and it was not finished before the yeare 1486. the second of Henry the seuenth. It was newe gilt all ouer in the yeare 1522. against the comming in of Charles, the fift Emperor, and was new burnished against the Coronation of Edward the sixt. And gilt againe in the yeare 1554. against the comming in of king Philip. Since the which time, the said CrosseCorsse in Cheape indighted, the Images broken. hauing bene presented by diuers Iuries (or Wardmote Inquests) to stand in the highway, to the let of carriages, &c. In the yeare 1581. the 21. of Iune in the night, the lowest Images about the said Crosse, were broken and defaced.
               Wherupon proclamation was made, that who so wold bewray the doers therof, shuld haue fortie crownes: but nothing came to light. The Image of the blessed virgin at the time robbed of her son, and her armes broken by which shee staied him on her knées, her whole bodie also was strained with ropes so as it was readie to fall: But was in the yeare 1595. againe fastened and repaired. In the yeare 1596. about Bartholomewtide, a new Sonne mishapen (as borne out of time) was laide in her armes. The other Images remaining broken as before.
               On the East side of the same Crosse, the steppes being taken thence, vnder the Image of Christes resurrection, was set vp a curious wrought frame of grey Marble, and in the same an Image in Alablaster of a woman, (for the most part naked) and Thames waterThames water conueyed to the Crosse in Cheape. prilling from her breasts: but the same is oft times dryed vp.
               At the Southwest corner of Woodstréete, is the parish Church of S. Peter
                  Parish Church of Saint Peter in Cheape. the Apostle, by the said Crosse, a proper Church lately new builded. Iohn Shawe Goldsmith Maior, deceased 1503. appointed by his Testament, the said Church and stéeple to be newly builded of his goods, with a flat roofe. Notwithstanding Tho. Wood Goldsmith; one of the Sheriffes, 1491. is accounted principall benefactor: because the roofe of the middle Ile is supported by Images of Woodmen. I finde to haue bene buried in this Church, Nicholas Farendon Maior, Richard Hadley Grocer, 1492. Iohn Palmer Fishmonger, 1500. William Rouse Goldsmith Sheriffe, 1429. T. Atkins Esquire, 1400. Ioh.

               The long shop, or narrow shed, incroching on the high way before this Church, was licensed to be made in the yeare 1401. for thirtie shillings foure pence the yeares rent, but now increased much.
               Then is Guthuruns lane,Long shop or shead by the Crosse in Cheape. so called of Guthurun, sometime owner thereof. The inhabitants of this lane, of olde time were goldbeaters, as doth appeare by records in the Exchequer. For the easterling money was appointed to be made of fine siluer, such as men made into foyle, and was commonly called siluer of Guthuruns lane,Guthuruns Lane. &c.

               Then downe Fausterlane and Noble stréete, at the North end whereof, is one great house builded of stone, commonly called the Lord Windsors house, but I haue read it by the name of Neuels InneNeuels Inne or the Lord Winsors house. in siluer stréete, and at the ende of Monkes well stréete.Monkes well stréete.
               
               In this streete on the west side thereof, is the Barbers Chirurgians Hall,Barber Chyrurgians hall. whom obtained their incorporation in the yeare one thousand foure hundred sixtie and foure, the second of Edward the fourth, since the which time, they builded theyr Hall.
               
                   At the North corner of this stréete, on the same side, was sometime an Hermitage,Hermitage of S. Iames in the Wall. (or Chappell of Saint Iames) called in the Wall, neare Cripplegate: it belonged to the Abbey and Couent of Garadon, as appeareth by a record of Edward the first in the twentie seuen yeare. And by a record of Edward the third, the sixtéenth yeare. William de Lyons was Hermit there, and the Abbot and Couent of Geredon, founded two Chapleins, cistercian Monkes of their house: in this Hermitage, one of them was founded there, for Aymor de Valence, Earle of Pembrooke, and Mary de Saint Paule, his Countesse.
               Of these Monkes, and of a well pertaining to them, the stréete tooke that name, and is called Monkes-well streete. This Hermitage with the purtenāces, was in the raigne of Edward the sixt purchased from the said King, by William Lambe one of the gentlemen of the kings Chappell, Citizen and cloathworker of London: he deceased in the yeare 1577. and then gaue it to the Cloath-workers in London: with other Tenements, to the value of fiftie pound the yeare, to the intent they shall hire a Minister to say diuine seruice there, &c.
               Againe to the high stréete of Cheape, from Fauster lane ende to S.

                  Parish Church of S. Nicholas. whereof the said flesh market tooke the name, and was called S. Nicholas Shambles. This church with the tenements, and Ornaments, was by Henry the eight, giuen to the Mayor and communaltie of the citie, towards the maintenance of the newe Parish church, then to bee erected in the late dissolued church of the Gray Fryers: so was this church dissolued and pulled downe. In place whereof, and of the church yard, many faire houses are now builded in a court with a well, &c.
               Then is Stinking lane,Stinking lane, or Chick lane so called, or Chicke-lane at the East end of the Gray Fryers church. And then the late dissolued church of the Gray Fryers:Graye Fryers Church. The Originall whereof, was this.
               
                   The first of this order of Fryers in England nine in number, arriued at Douer: fiue of them remained at Canterburie, the other 4. came to London, were lodged at the preaching Friers in Oldboorn, for the space of fiftéene dayes: and then they hyred an house in Cornhill, of Iohn Treuers, one of the Sheriffes of London. They builded there little cells, wherein they inhabited, but shortly after, the deuotion of the citizens towards them, and the number of the Fryers so increased, that they were by the citizens remooued to a place in S. Nicholas Shambles: which Iohn Ewin Mearcer, appropriated vnto the comunaltie, to the vse of these said Fryers, and himselfe became a lay-brother amongst them. About the yeare 1225.

               In the yeare 1087. this church of S. Paule
                  Saint Paules church brent. was brent with fire, and therwith the more part of the citie
                     •
                   which fire began at the entry of the West gate, and consumed to the East gate. Mauricius then Bishop, began therefore the foundation of a new church of S. Paule,
                  Foundation of the newe Church of S. Paul builded, stone brought from Cane in Normandie. a work that men of that time iudged wold neuer haue bin finished, it was to them so wonderfull for length & breadth, & also ye same was builded vpon Arches (or Ua
                     •
                  ltes) of stone, for defence of fire, which was a manner of woorke before that time vnknowne to the people of this Nation, and then brought in by the French: and the stone was fetcht from Cane in Normandy.
               
               This Mauricius deceased in the yeare 1107. Richard Beamor succéeded him in the Bishoppricke, who did wonderfully increase the said church, purchasing of his owne cost, the large stréetes and Lanes about it, wherin were wont to dwel many laye people, which ground he began to compasse about, with a strong wall of stone and gates. King Henry the first gaue to the said Richard, so much of the Mote (or Wall) of the castle, on the Thames side to the South, as should be néedfull to make the said wal of the church, and so much as should suffise to make a wall without the way on the North side, &c.
               
                   It should séeme that this Richard inclosed but two sides of the saide church or Semitorie of Saint Paule, to wit, the South and North sides: for King Edward the second, in the tenth of his raigne, graunted that the saide church yarde should be inclosed with a wall where it wanted, for the murthers and robberies that were there committed. But the cittizens then claimed the East part of the church yarde to bee the place of assembly to their folkemotes, and that the great stéeple there scituate was to that vse, their common bell,The comm
                        ••
                      bell in Paule: church yard rung, for the calling togither of the Citizens to their folkemotes. which being there rung, all the inhabitants of the citie might heare and come togither. They also claimed the West side, that they might there assemble themselues togither, with the Lorde of Baynardes castle, for view of their Armour in defence of the citie. This matter was in the Tower of London referred to Haruius de Stanton, and his fellow Iustices Itenerantes: but I finde not the decision or iudgement of that controuersie.
               True it is, that Edward the third, in the seuentéene of his raigne, gaue commandement for the finishing of that wall, which was then performed, and to this day it continueth. Although now on both the sides (to wit, within and without) it be hidden with dwelling houses. Richard Beamer deceased in the yeare 1127. and his successors in processe of time, performed the worke begunne.
               The stéeple of this church was builded and finished in the yeare 1222. The crosse on the said stéeple fell downe, and a new was set vp in the yeare 1314. The new worke of PowlesPowles steeple. (so called) at the East ende aboue the Quire, was begun in the yeare 1251.
               
                  Henry Lacie Earle of Lincolne, Constable of Chester, and Custos of England, in his time was a great benefactor to this work, and was there buried, in the yeare 1310. Also Raphe Baldocke Bishop of London, in his life time gaue two hundreth markes to the building of the saide newe worke:The newe woorke of Powles. and left much by his Testament, towards the finishing thereof, he deceased in the yeare 1313 and was buried in the Lady chappell.
               The first of February, in the yeare 1444. about two of the clock in the afternoone, this stéeple was fiered by lightning,Powles steeple fiered by lightning. in the midst of the shaft or spéere, both on the West side, & on the South, but by labour of many well disposed people, the same was to appearance quenched with Uinegre, so that all men withdrew themselues  to their

               The Colledge of Petty Cannons there,Petie Cannons of Pauls. was founded by king Richard the second, in honor of Quéene Anne his wife, and of her progenitors, in the 17. of his raign. Their Hall and lands was then giuen vnto them, as appeareth by the Pattent, Maister Robert Dokesworth then being maister thereof.
               There was also one great Cloyster on the North side of this church,Great Cloystry of Pauls. inuironing a plot of ground, of old time called Pardō church yard, whereof Thomas More (Deane of Pauls) was either the first builder, or a most especiall benefactor, and was buried there.Daunce of Pauls. About this Cloyster, was artificially & richly painted, the dance of Machabray, 
                   or dance of death, commonly called the dance of Pauls: the like wherof, was painted about S. Innocents cloister, at Paris in Frāce: the metres or poesie of this daunce, were translated out of French into English, by Iohn Lidgate, the Monke of Bery, & with y• picture of Death, leading all estates painted about the Cloyster: at the speciall request and dispence of Iankin Carpenter, in the Raigne of Henry the 6. In this Cloyster were buried many persons, some of worship, and others of honour: the monuments of whom, in number and curious workemanship, passed all other that were in that church.
               Ouer the East Quadrant of this Cloyster, was a faire Librarie,Librarie of Pauls. builded at the costs and charges of Walter Sherington, Chancelor of the Duchie of Lancaster, in the raigne of Henry the 6. which hath béene well furnished with faire written bookes in Uellum: but fewe of them now do remaine there. In the middest of this pardon church yard, was also a faire Chapel,Chapell in Pardon church-yard. first foūded by Gilbert Becker, Portgraue and principal magistrate of this citie, in the raign of king Stephen, who was there buried.
               
                  Thomas Moore Deane of Pauls before named, reedified this Chappel, and founded thrée Chaplains there, in the raigne of Henry the 5.
               In the yeare 1549. on the tenth of Aprill, the said Chappell by commaundement of the Duke of Summerset, was begun to bee pulled downe, with the whole Cloystrie, the daunce of Death, the Tombes, and monuments: so that nothing thereof was left, but the bare plot of ground, which is since conuerted into a garden, for the Pety Canons. There was also a Chapel at the North dore of Pauls,
                  Chappell at the North dore of Pauls. founded by the same Walter Sherington, by license of Henry the sixt, for two, thrée, or foure Chaplains, indowed with fortie pound by the yeare. This Chapell also was pulled downe in the raigne of Edward the sixt, and in place thereof, a faire house builded.
               There was furthermore, a faire Chapel of the holy Ghost in Pauls church, on the North side: founded in the yeare, 1400. by Roger Holmes, Chauncelor and Prebendary of Pauls, for Adam Bery Alderman, Iohn Wingham and others, for seuen Chaplains, and called Holmes Colledge.Holmes Colledge. Their common Hall was in Pauls church yard on the South side. This Colledge also was with others suppressed  in the raigne of Edward the sixt. Then vnder the Quire of Paules is alarge chapel, first dedicated to the name of Iesu, founded the 37. of Henry the sixt, as appeareth by his patent thereof, dated at Crodowne to this effect. Many liege men, and Christian people hauing begun a fraternitie, and guild, to the honour of the most glorious name of Iesu Christ our Sauiour, in a place called y• crowdes of the Cathedrall church of Paules in London, which hath continued long time peaceably, till now of late: whereupon they haue made request, and we haue taken vpon vs the name and charge of the foundation, to the la

                  de of Almightie God, the Father, the Sonne and the holy Ghost, and especially to the honour of Iesu, in whose honour, the fraternitie was begun, &c.
               The King ordained William Say then Deane of Pauls to bee the Rector, and Richard Ford, (a remembrancer in the Exchequer) and Henry Bennis (clarke of his priuie Seale) the Gardians of these brothers and sisters: they and theyr successors to haue a common seale: license to purchase lands or tenements to the value of 40 pound by the yeare, &c.
               This foundation was confirmed by Henry the seuenth, the two and twentie of his reigne, to Doctor Collet, then Deane of Powles, Rector there, &c. And by Henry the eight, the seuen and twentieth of his raigne, to Richard Pace, then Deane of Pauls, &c.
               At the West ende of this Iesus chapell, vnder the Quire of Pauls, also was a Parish church of Saint Fayth,
                  Parish Chrch of Saint Faith. commonly called Saint Faith vnder Pauls, which serued for the Stacioners and others, dwelling in Pauls church yard, Pater Noster Rowe, and the places neare adioyning. The said chapell of Iesus being suppressed in the raigne of Edward the sixt: the Parishioners of Saint Fayths church were remooued into the same Iesus chapell, as to a place more sufficient for largenesse and lightsomenesse, then their former church was, and so it still remaineth to that vse.
               Then was there on the North side of this church yarde, a Charnell houseCharnel house with a Chapel. for the boanes of the dead, and ouer it a chapell of an olde foundation, such as followeth. In the yeare one thousand two hundred eightie two, the tenth of Edward the first, it was agreed,  that Henry Walles Mayor, and the citizens, for cause of shops by them builded, without the wal of the churh yard, should assigne to God, and to the church of Saint Paul, ten markes of rent by the yeare for euer, towards the new building of a chapell of the blessed Uirgin Mary, and also to assigne fiue markes of yearly rent to a Chaplaine to celebrate there.
               Moreouer in the yeare 1430. the eight of Henry the sixt, license was graunted to Iankin Carpenter, (executor to Richard Whittington) to establish vpon the said Charnell, a Chaplaine, to haue eight markes by the yeare: Then was also in this chapel, two brotherhoods. In this chapell were buried Robert Barton, and Henry Barton Maior, and Thomas Mirfin Maior, all Skinners, and were entombed with their Images of Alablaster ouer them, grated about with Iron: all which, was pulled downe in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred fortie nine, the bones of the dead, couched vp in a Charnill (by report of him who paid for the cariage) were conueied from thence into Finsbery fielde, amounting to more then one thousand cart loades, and there laid on a moorish ground,Reign-Wolfe. in short space after raysed (by soylage of the citie) to heare thrée winde-milles.
               The chapell and Charnill were conuerted into dwelling houses, ware houses, and sheads for Stacioners, builded before it, in place of the Tombes. In the East part of this church yard, standeth Powles schoole,Powles schoole. lately builded and endowed in the yeare 1512. by Iohn Collet Doctor of Diuinitie, and Deane of Powles, for 153. poore mens children, to be taught frée in the same scoole, for which hée appointed a Maister, a Surmaister, or Usher, and a Chaplaine, with large stipends for euer, committing the case and ouersight thereof, to the Maister, Wardens, and Assistants of the Mearcers in London, because he was borne in London, and was sonne to Henry Collet, Mearcer, sometime Maior. He left to these Mearcers, landes, to the yearelie value of one hundred and twentie pound or better. Neare vnto this schoole on the North side thereof, was of old time a great and high ClochierClochiard in Powles church yard.

               The common spéech then was, that he did set an hundred poūd vpon a cast at dice against it, and so wonne the saide Clocheard and belles of the King: and then causing the belles to be broken as they hoong, the rest was pulled downe and broken also. This man was afterward executed on the Tower hill, for matters concerning the Duke of Summerset, in the yeare 1551. the fift of Edward the sixt.

In which, are sermons preached by learned Diuines euery Sunday in the forenoone. The very antiquitie whereof, is to me vnknowne: but I reade, that in the yeare 1259. King Henry the third, commanded a generall assembly to be made at this Crosse, where he in proper person commaunded the Mayor, that on the next day following, he should cause to bee sworne before the Aldermen, euery stripling of twelue yeares of age, or vpward, to bee true to the King and his heires, Kings of England.
               
               Also in the yeare 1262. the same King caused to bee read at Pauls Crosse, a Bull obtained from Pope Vrban the fourth, as an absolution for him, and for all that were sworne to maintaine the Articles made in Parliament at Oxford.

In the yeare 1561. the fourth of Iune, betwixt the houre of thrée and foure of the Clocke in afternoone, the great speare of the stéeple of Saint Pauls church,Pauls steeple and Church brent. was fiered by lightening, which brake fourth (as it séemed) two or thrée yardes beneathe the foote of the Crosse, and from thence it brent  downeward the speare to the battlements, stone worke and bels, so furiously, that within the space of foure houres, the same stéeple with all the Roofes of the church, were consumed, to the great sorow and perpetuall remembrance of all the beholders.

               Six citizens of London, and two Pettie Canons of Powles church, hadde charge to further and ouersée the woorke, wherein such expedition was vsed, that within one moneth next following the burning thereof, the church was couered with boordes and lead, in manner of a false Roofe against the weather, and before the ende of the said yeare, all the said Iles of the church were framed out of new timber, couered with leade, and fully finished. The same yeare also, the great Roofes of the West and East endes were framed out of great timber in Yorkeshiere, brought thence to London by sea, and set vp, and couered with leade. But concerning the stéeple, litle was done, through whose default God knoweth: it was said, that the money appointed for newe building of the stéeple, was collected, and brought to the hands of Edmond Grindall then Bishop of London.

Ewine,
                  Parish Church of S. Ewin. (as is before said) was giuen by Henry the 8. towards the erecting of Christes Church: it was taken downe, and in place thereof, a faire strong frame of timber was erected, wherein dwell men of diuers Trades. And from this frame to Newgate, is all of this Warde, and so an ende thereof. It hath an Alderman, his Deputie, Common Councell 12. Constables 17. Scauingers 18. Wardmote Inquest, 18. and a Bedle.

Then is also a part of Watheling stréet of this ward, to wit, from ouer against the Red Lyon on the North side vp almost to Powles gate, for it lacketh but one house of S. Augustins Church. And on the South side, from ye Red Lyon gate to the Old Exchaunge, and down the same Exchaunge on the East side, by the West end of Mayden Lane, or Distar Lane, to Knightrydars stréete, or as they call that part thereof, Old Fishstréete. And all the North side of the said Old Fishstréete, to the South ende of Bredstréete, and by that still in Knightridars stréete, till ouer against the Trinitie Church, and Trinitie Lane. Then is BredstréetBredstreete. it selfe so called of bread in old time there sold: for it appeareth by records, that in the yeare 1302. which was the 30. of Ed. the 1. The Bakers of London were bounden to sell no bread in their shops or houses, but in the Market, and that they should haue 4. Hall motes in the yeare, at foure seuerall termes, to determine of enormities belonging to the said Company.
               This stréete giuing the name to the whole Warde, beginneth in West Cheape, almost by the Standard, and runneth downe South, through or thwart Watheling stréete, to Knightridars stréet aforesaid, where it endeth. This Bredstréete is wholly on both sides of this Warde. Out of the which stréete on the East side, is Basing Lane, a péece whereof, to wit, too and and ouer against the backe gate of the Red Lyon in Watheling stréete, is of this Bredstréete Warde.
               Then is there one other stréete, which is called Friday stréete,Friday streete. and beginneth also in West Cheape, and runneth downe South through Watheling stréete, to Knightrider stréete (or Old Fishstréet) This Friday stréete is of Bredstréete Warde, on the East side from ouer against the Northeast corner of saint Mathewes Church, and on the West side from the South corner of the said Church, down

                  In this Fryday stréete on the West side thereof, is a Lane, commonly called Mayden Lane, or Distaffe Lane, corruptly for Distar Lane, which runneth West into the olde Exchange: and in this lane is also one other Lane, on the South side thereof, likewise called Distar Lane, which runneth downe to Knightriders Stréete, or olde Fishstréete: and so be the boundes of this whole Warde. The Monuments to bee noted here, are first, the most bewtifull frame and front of faire houses and shops, that be within all the walles of London, or elsewhere in England, commonly called Godsmithes rowe,The Goldsmithes rowe in Cheape. betwixt Breadstréet end, and the Crosse in Cheape, but is within this Breadstréete Warde: the same was builded by Thomas Wood Goldsmith, one of the Sheriffes, in the yeare 1491. It continueth in number, tenne faire dwelling houses, and fouretéene shops, all in one frame vniformely builded, foure stories high, bewtified towards the stréete, with the Goldsmithes Armes, and the likenesse of woodmen (in memorie of his name) riding on monstrous beasts, all which is cast in Leade, richly painted ouer, and guilt: these hee gaue to the Goldsmithes, with stockes of money to be lent to young men, hauing those shops &c.
               This said Front was againe new painted and guilt ouer, in the yeare 1594. Sir Richard Martin being then Maior, and kéeping his Maioraltie in one of them, and seruing out the time of Cutber

Then for Watheling Stréete,Watheling streete. which Leyland calleth Atheling or Noble stréet: but since he sheweth no reason why it was so called, I rather take it so named of the great high way of the same calling. True it is, that at this present as of olde time also, the inhabitants thereof were and are, wealthy Drapers, retailors of woollen cloathes both broad and narrowe, of all sortes, more then in any one stréete of this Citie. Of the olde Exchange, heere I haue noted in Faringdon Warde: wherfore I passe downe to Knightriders stréet,Knightriders Streete. wherof I haue also spoken in Cordwainer stréete Ward, but in this part of the said Knightriders stréete, is a fishmarket kept, and therefore called olde Fishstréete, for a difference from new Fishstréete.
               In this olde Fishstréete,Fishmarket called olde Fishstreete. is one rowe of small houses, placed along in the middest of Knightriders stréete, which rowe is also of Bredstréete Warde, these houses now possessed of Fishmoongers, were at the  first but mooueable boordes (or stables) sette out on market dayes, to shewe their fish there to be sold: but procuring license to set vp sheads, they grewe to shops, and by litle and litle, to tall houses, of thrée or 4. stories in heigth, and now are called Fishstréete. Bredestréet,Bredstreete. so called of bread solde there (as I sayd) is now wholely inhabited by rich Marchants, and diuers faire Innes be there for good receipt of carriers, and other trauellers to the citie. On the East side of this stréet, at the corner of Watheling Stréete, is the proper church of Alhallowes in Bred street,Parish church of Alhallowes in Bredstreet. wherin are the monuments of Iames Thame Goldsmith, Iohn Walpole Goldsmith 1349.

               Lower downe on the same side, is the parish church of Saint Mildred
                  Parish church of S. Mildred in Bredstreet. the Uirgine.

Sir Ambrose Nicholas Salter, Maior, 1575. was buried in Sir Iohn Chadworths Uault.
               Out of this Bredstréet, on the same East side, is a Basing lane, a part whereof (as is afore shewed) is of this Warde, but howe it tooke the name I haue not read: other then that in the 20. yeare of Richard the second, the same was called the Bakehouse:Basing Lane called the Bakehouse. whetherment for the Kings Bakehouse, or of Bakers dwelling there, and baking bread to serue the Market in Bredstréete, where the bread was solde, I knowe not: but sure I am, I haue not reade yet of any Basing, or of Gerrarde the Gyant, to haue any thing there to doo.
               On the South side of this Lane, is one great house, of old time builded vpon Arched Uaultes, of stone, and with Arched Gates, now a common Ostrey for receit of Trauellers, commonly and corruptly called Gerardes Hall, of a Gyaunt saide to haue dwelled there.A Pole of 40. foote long, and 
                        •
                     5. inches about, fabuled to be the iusting staffe of Gerarde a Giant. In the high Rooffed Hall of this house, sometime stood a large Firre Pole, which reached to the roofe therof, and was said to be one of the staues that Gerarde the Gyant vsed in the warres, to runne withall. There stoode also a Ladder of the same length, which (as they say) serued to ascende to the toppe of the Staffe. Of later yeares this Hall is altered in building, and diuers roomes are made in it. Notwithstanding the Pole is remoued to one corner of the Hall, and the Ladder hanged broken vp on a Wall in the yarde. The Hostelar of that house saide to me, the Pole lacked halfe a foote of fortie in length: I measured the compasse,  and founde it to bee fiftéene inches. Reason of the Pole, coulde the maister of the Hostrey giue me none, but badde me reade the great Chronicles, for there he had heard of it. Which aunswere séemed to me insufficient, for hée meant the description of Brittaine, before Reinwoolfes Chronicle, wherein the Authour writing a Chapter of Gyaunts, and hauing béene deceiued by some Authours, too much crediting their smoothe spéeche, hath set downe more matter then troth, as partly (and also against my will) I am enforced to touch. R. G.
                  R.G. A stone said to be a toothe, and so by coniecture, a man to be 28. foote of height. in this briefe collection of Histories hath these wordes. I the writer hereof, did sée the tenth day of March, in the yeare of our Lord 1564. and had the same in my hande, the Toothe of a man, which waighed tenne Ounces of Troy waight. And the skull of the same man is extant and to be seene, which will holde fiue Peckes of wheate. And the shinne bone of the same man is sixe foote in length, and of a maruellous greatnesse. Thus farre of R. G. Wherevnto is added in the saide discription, that by coniecturall simetrie of those partes, the bodie to be twentie eight foote long or more. From this hee goeth to an other matter, and so to Gerard the Gyant and his staffe. But to leaue these fictions and to return where I left, I will note what my selfe haue obserued concerning that house.
               I reade, that Iohn Gisors
                  Gisors Hall restored to his old name. Mayor of London, in the yeare 1245. was owner thereof, and that Sir Iohn Gisors Knight Mayor of London, and Constable of the Tower, one thousand thrée hundreth and eleuen. And diuers others of that name and family since that time owed it. For I reade that William Gisors was one of the Sheriffes, one thousand thrée hundreth twentie nine. More, that Iohn Gisors had issue, Henry and Iohn. Which Iohn had issue, Thomas. Which Thomas deceasing in the yeare one thousand thrée hundreth and fiftie, left vnto his sonne Thomas, his Messuage called Gysors Hall, in the Parish of Saint Mildred in Bredstréete: Iohn Gisors made a Feofment thereof, one thousand thrée hundreth eightie sixe, &c.Gerards Hall ouerthrowne with Gerard the Giant, and his great spea
                        •
                     . So that it appeareth that this Gisors Hall of late time by corruption hath bin called Gerards Hall, for Gisors Hall, as Bosomes Inne for Blossoms In.  Beuis Markes, for Buries Marke. Marke Lane, for Marte Lane: Belliter Lane, for Belsetters Lane: Gutter Lane, for Guthuruns Lane: Cry church, for Christes church: S. Mihell in the Querne, for Saint Mihell at Corne, and sundrie such others. Out of this Gisors Hall, at the first building thereof, were made diuers Arched doores, yet to be séene, which séeme not sufficient for any great monsture, or other then men of common stature to passe through, the Pole in the Hall might be vsed of olde time (as then the custome was in euery parish) to be set vp in the streete, in the Summer as a Maypole, before the principall Hall, or house in the parish, or streete, and to stand in the Hall before the scrine, decked with Holme & Iuie, all the feast of Christmas.Euery mans house of olde time was decked with holly and Iuie in the winter, especially at Christmas. The lader serued for decking of the Maypole,
& Roofe of the Hall. Thus much for Gisors Hal & for ye side of Bredstreet, may suffice. Now on ye West side of Bredstréet, amongst diuers fayre and large houses for merchants, and faire Innes for passengers, had yee one prison house pertaining to the Sheriffes of London, called the compter in Bredstréete: but in the yeare 1555 the prisones were remooued from thence, to one other new CompterCoumpter in Bredstreete. in Woodstréete, prouided by the cities purchase, and builded for that purpose: the cause of which remooue was this. Richard Husband Pastelar, kéeper of this Coumpter in Bredstréet, being a wilful and headstrong man, dealt for his owne aduantage, hardly with the prisonersPrisoners remoued from the Coumpter in Bredstreete to a new coumter in Woodstreete. Keeper of the counter sēt to Newgate. vnder his charge, hauing also sernants such as himselfe liked best for their bad vsage, and woulde not for any complaint bee reformed: wherèupon in the yeare 1550. Sir Rowland Hill beeing Mayor, by the assent of a court of Aldermen, he was sent to the gayle of Newgate, for the cruell handling of his prisoners: and it was cō
                  maunded to the kéeper of set those irons on his legges, which are called the widows almes: These he ware from Thursday, till Sunday in the afternoone, and being by a court of Aldermen released, on the Tuesday, was bound in an hundred markes, to obserue from thenceforth an act made by the common councell, for the ordering of prisoners in the Compters: all which notwithstanding, hee continued as afore: whereof my selfe am partly a witnesse: for being of a Iurie to enquire against a Sessions of Gayle deliuerie, in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred fiftie two, wee found the prisoners hardly dealt withall, for theyr achates and otherwise,Quest of inquirie indight the keepers of the gayles for dealing hardly with their prisoners. and  that théeues and strumpets were there lodged for foure pence the night, whereby they might be safe from searches that were made abroad:They indighted the bowling Allies, &c. for the which enormities, and other not néedfull to bee recited, he was indighted at that Session, but did rubbe it out, and could not be reformed, til this remoue of ye prisoners for the house in Bredstreete was his owne by Lease, or otherwise, so that he could not bee put from it. Such Gaylors buying their offices, will deale hardly with pittifull prisoners. Now in Fryday stréete,Friday streete. so called of Fishmoongers dwelling there, and seruing frydayes market, on the East side, is a small parish church, commonly called S. Iohn Euangelist,
                  Parish church of S. Iohn Euangelist. the monuments therein, be of Iohn Dogget Marchantaylor, one of the Sheriffes, in the yeare 1509. Sir Christoper Askew Draper, Mayor, 1533. Then lower downe, is one other parish church of S. Margaret Moyses,
                  Parish church of S. Margaret Moyses. so called (as séemeth) of one Moyses, that was founder, or new builder thereof. The monuments there, bee of sir Richard Dobbet Skinner, Mayor, 1551. William Dane Ironmoonger, one of the Sheriffes, 1569. Sir Iohn Allet Fishmoonger, Mayor 1591.
               On the West side of this Fryday stréete, is Mayden Lane,Maiden Lane or Distarlane. so named of such a signe, or Distaffe Lane, for Distar Lane, as I reade in record of a Brew-house, called the Lambe in Distar Lane, the sixtéenth of Henry the sixt. In this Distar Lane, on the North side thereof, is the Cord-wayners,Cordwayners Hall. or Shoomakers Hall, which company were made a brotherhood or fraternitie, in the eleuenth of Henry the fourth. On the South side of this Distar Lane, is also one other Lane, called Distar Lane: which runneth downe to Knightriders stréete, or olde Fishstréete, and this is the ende of Bredstréete Warde: which hath an Alderman, his Deputie, Common Councell tenne. Constables ten. Skauengers eight. Wardmote Inquest thirtéene, and a Beadle. In standeth taxed to the fiftéene in London, at thirtie seuen pound, and in the Exchequer at thirtie sixe pound tenne shillings.
            
            
               
               Queene Hithe Warde.
               NExt vnto Bredstréet Warde, on the South side therof, is Quéen Hithe Ward,Queen Hithe Warde. so called of a water gate, or harborow for Boates, Lighters and Barges, and was of olde time for shippes, at what time, the timber bridge of London was drawne vp, for the passage of them to the saide Hithe, as to a principall strand for landing and vnlading against the middest and hart of the Citie. This Warde beginneth in the East, in Knightriders stréete,Knightriders streete. on the South side thereof, at the East ende of the Parish church called the holy Trinitie, and runneth West on the South side to a lane called Lambert hill, which is the length of the Warde in Knightriders stréete, out of the which stréet are diuers Lanes, running South to Thames stréete, and are of this Warde: the first is Trinitie Lane,Trinitie Lane. which runneth downe by the West end of Trinitie Church. Then is Spuren Lane,Spuren Lanes, or Huggēlane. or Sporners Lane, now called Huggen Lane. Then Bredstréet hill. Then S. Mary Mounthaunt: out of the which Lane, on the East side thereof, is one other Lane, turning East, through S. Nicholas Olaues Church yard, to Bredstréete hill. This Lane is called Finimore Lane or fiue foote Lane, because it is but fiue foote in breadth at the West ende:Finimore or fiue foot lane. In the middest of this lane, runneth downe one other lane broader, South to Thames stréete, I thinke the same to be called Desboorne Lane,Desborne lane for I reade, of such a Lane to haue bin in the parish of Mary Summerset, in the two and twentieth yeare of Edward the 3. where there is saide to lye betwéene the Tenement of Edward de Mountaoute Knight, on the East part, and the tenement sometime pertaining to William Gladwine on the West, one plot of ground, containing in length towards Thames stréete 25. foote &c.
               Last of all, haue you Lambart hillLambert hil. Lane, so called of one Lambart an owner thereof: and this is the furthest West part of this Warde. On the North side comming downe from Knightriders stréete, the  East side of Lambards hill, is wholely of this Warde: and the west side, from the North end of the Black-smithes Hall (which is about the middest of this Lane) vnto Thames Stréete. Then part of Thames stréete, is also of this Warde, to wit, from a Cookes house called the signe of King Dauid, thrée houses West, from the olde Swan Brewhouse in the East, vnto Huntington house, ouer against Saint Peters Church in the West, neare vnto Powles Wharffe. And on the land side from a Cookes house called the blew Boore, to the West ende of Saint Peters Church, and vp Saint Peters Hill, two houses North aboue the saide Church. And these bee the boundes of this Warde: in which, are Parish Churches seuen, Halles of Companies two, and other Ornaments, as shall he shewed.
               First, in Knightriders stréete, is the small Parish Church of the holy Trinitie,Parish church of the Trinity. very olde and in daunger of downe falling: collections haue béene made for the repairing thereof, but they will not stretch to farre, and therefore it leaneth vpon proppes or stilts. Monuments are therein none. Towards the West ende of Knightriders stréete, is the Parish Church of S. Nicholas Colde Abbey, a comely Church,Parish church of S. Nicholas Colde Abey. somewhat auncient, as appeareth by the wayes raised thereabout: it hath béene called of many, Golden Abbey, of some Colde Abbey, and so hath the most auncientest writing: but I could neuer learne the cause why it should bee so called, and therefore I will let it passe. There bee monuments in this Church, of Andrew Awbery Grocer, Mayor, and Thomas Fryar Fishmoonger, in the yeare 1351. who gaue to this Church and parish one plot of ground, containing fiftie six foote in length, and fortie thrée foote in breadth, at both endes to be a buriall place for the dead of the said Parish, the twentie sixt of Edward the third. Also Thomas Madefrey Clarke, and Iohn Pylot, gaue to the Wardens of that Parish, one shop, and a house in Distar lane, for the continual repairing of the bodie of that church, the belles and Ornaments the twentieth of Richard the 2. buried there Iohn Calfe, & William Cogeshall, Walter Turke Fishmoonger Mayor, 1349.

                  On the North side of this church in the Wall thereof, was of late builded a conuenient Eistern of stone and lead, for receit of Thames water,Water condit. conueyed in pipes of leade to that place, for the ease and commoditie of the Fishmoongers, and other inhabitants, in and about olde Fishstréete. Barnard Randolphe common Seriant of the cittie of London, did in his life time deliuer to the company of Fishmoongers, the sum of nine hundred, pound, to bee imployed towards the conducting of the said Thames water, and sisterning the same, &c. In the parishes of S. Mary Magdalen, and S. Nicholas Colde Abbay neare vnto Fishstréete, seuen hundred pound, and other two hundred pound to charitable déedes: he deceased, 1583. and shortly after, this conduit with the other, was made and finished.
               In Trinitie Lane, on the west side thereof, is the Painter stayners Hall,Painter stainers Hall. for so of olde time were they called, but now that workemanship of stayning is departed out of vse in England Lower down in Trinitie Lane on the East side thereof, was sometime a great Messuage pertaining vnto Iohn Earle of Cornwell,

On Bredstréet hill down to the Thames on both sides, bee diuers faire houses, inhabited by Fishmoongers, Chéesemoongers, and Marchants of diuers trades. On the West side whereof, is the parish church of S. Nicholas Oliue, a conuenient church, hauing the monumēts of William Newport Fishmoonger, one of the Sheriffes 1375. Richard Willowes Parson 1391. Richard Sturges Fishmoonger 1470. Thomas Lewen Ironmoonger, one of the Sheriffes 1537. who gaue his messuage with yt purtenances, wherein he dwelt, with fourtéene Tenements in the saide Parish of S.

Blitheman, an excellent Orgainest of the Quéenes Chapell, lyeth buried there with an Epitaphe, 1591, &c. The next is olde Fishstréet hill,Old Fishsteet hill. a Lane so called, which also runneth downe to Thames stréete. In this lane on the East side thereof, is ye one end of Finimore on Fiue foote lane. On the West side of this old Fishstréete hill, is the Bishop of Herefordes Inne or lodging:Bishop of Herefords house. an auncient house, and large roomes builded of stone and timber, which sometime belonged to the Mounthaunts 
                   in Norfolke. Radulphus de Maydenstone, Bishop of Hereford, about 1234. bought it of the Mounthaunts, and gaue it to the Bishoppes of Hereforde, his successors. Charles both Chancellour of the Marches, Bishoppe of Hereforde, about the yeare 1517. repaired it, since the which time, the same is greatly ruinated, and is now diuided into many small tenements: the Hall and principall roomethes, are an house to make Suger loues, &c. Next adioyning, is the parish Church of S. Mary de Mounte Alto, or Mounthaunte, this is a very small church,Parish Church of Saint Mary Monte Alto. and at the first builded to be a chapple for the saide house of the Mounthaunts, and for Tenements thereunto belonging.

               I finde that Stphen Spilman, Gentleman of that Family in Norfolke, sometime Mearcer, Chamberlaine of London, then one of the Sheriffes and Alderman, in the yeare 1404. deceasing without issue, gaue his landes to his Family the Spilmans

Richard Gray Ironmoonger Alderman, one of the Sheriffes 1515 gaue fortie pound to that church, and was buried there. At the west ende of that church goeth vp a lane, called Pyellane.Piellane. On the same North side, at the South ende of Saint Mary Mounthaunt Lane, is the parish church of Saint Mary Summerset,
                  Parish church of Saint Mary Summerset. ouer against the broken Wharffe: it is a proper church, but the Monuments are all defaced. I thinke the same to bee of olde time called Summers Hithe,Sūmers Hithe. of some mans name that was owner of the ground neare adioyning, as Edreds Hithe was, so called of Edred owner thereof, and Sythence called Quéene Hithe, as pertaining to the Quéene, &c.

Then is Quéene Hithe, a large receptackle for ships, lighters, barges, and such other vesselles.
               Touching the Antiquitie and vse of this gate and Hithe, first I finde, that of olde time the same belonged to one named Edred, and was then called Edreds Hithe,Edreds Hithe or Quene Hithe.

               This Edreds Hithe after the aforesaid grants, came againe to the Kings hands, by what meanes I haue not read, but it pertained vnto the Quéene, and therefore was called Ripa Reginae, the Quéenes Banque, or Quéenes Hithe, and great profit thereof was made to her vse, as may appeare by this which followeth.Record.
               
               King Henry the third, in the ninth of his Raigne, commanded the Constables of the Tower of London, to arrest the shippes of the Cinque Ports on the riuer of Thames, and to compell them to bring their corne to no other place but to the Quéenes Hithe onely.Ships of the ports arested and forced to bring their corne to Queen Hithe.
               
               In the eleuenth of his raigne, hee charged the saide Constable to destraine any fishe offered to be solde in any place of this cittie, but at the Quéene Hithe. Moreouer, in twentie eight of the said Kings raigne, an inquisition was made before William of Yorke, Prouost of Beuerley, Henry of Bathe, and Hierome of Caxton, Iustices Itenerants, sitting in the Tower of London, touching the customes of Quéene Hithe, obserued in the yeare last, before the warres, betwéene the King his father, and the Barons of England, and of olde customes of other times, and what customes had béene chaunged, at what time to Taxe and payment of all things comming thither, and betwéene woorepathe, and Anede Hithe, were found and ceased according to the olde order, as well corne and fishe as of other things: all which customes were as well to bee obserued in the parte of Dounegate as in Quéene Hithe, for the Kings vse. When also it was found, that the corne arriuing betwéene the gate of Guild Hall of the Merchants of Colleyne, and the Soke of the Archbishop of Canterburye (for he had a house neare vnto the Black Fryers) was not to be measured by any other quarter, then be that of the Quéenes soke.Liberty of the Queenes Hithe frō the Stilyard to the Black-Fryers. Soke is court.
               
               
                  After this, the Bayliffes of the saide Hithe complained, that since the saide Recognision, fourtéene forraine shippes laden with Fish, arriued at Bilnings Gate, which shippes should haue arriued at the saide Hithe: And therefore it was ordered, that if any forraine shippe laden with Fish, should in forme aforesaid, arriue elsewhere then at this Hithe, it should bee at the Kings pleasure to amerce them at 40. shillings. Notwithstanding, the shippes of the citizens of London were at libertie to arriue where the owners would appoint them.
               After this, the saide Henry the third, confirmed the graunt of Richard Earle of Cornwell, for the Farme of the Quéene Hithe,Queen Hithe let to farme to the Maior and Communaltie of London. vnto Iohn Gisors then Mayor, and to the Communaltie of London, and their successors for euer, as by this his Charter appeareth: Henry by the grace of God, King of England, lord of Ireland, Duke of Gwine, and Earle of Aniowe, to all Archbishops, &c.

The charge of this Quéene Hithe was then committed to the Sheriffes, and so hath continued euer since, the profits whereof are sore diminished, so that (as writeth Robert Fabian)Robert Fabian. it was woorth in his time litle aboue 20. Markes, or 15. pounde, one yeare with an other. Now for customes of this Quéene Hithe,Liber constitution. in the yeare 1302.Custome of Queen Hithe. the 30. of Ed. the 1. it was found by the oath of diuers men, that Bakers, Brewers, and others buying their corne at Quéene Hithe, should pay for measuring, portage, and carriage for euery quarter of corne whatsoeuer, from thence to West Cheape, to S. Anthonins Church, to Horshewe Bridge, and to Woolsey stréete in the Parish of Alhallowes the lesse, and such like distances, one ob. q. to Fléete Bridge, to Newgate, Criplegate, to Bercheouars Lane, to East-Cheape and Billings Gate, one penny. Also that the measurer (or the meater) ought to haue 8.A corne Meater, 8. M. Porters, and 24. Porters vnder them, at queen Hithe. chiefe Maister Porters, euery Maister to haue 3. Porters vnder him, and euery one of them to finde one horse, and seuen sackes, and he that so did not, to loose his Office. This Hithe was then so frequented with Uessels, bringing thither corne (besides fish, salt, fewell, and other marchandizes) that all these men, to wit, the Meater, and Porters, 37. in number, for all their charge of horses and sackes, and small stipend, liued well of their labours: but now that case is altered: the Bakers of London and others Citizens, trauell into the Countries, and buye their Corne of the Farmars, after the Farmars price.

               The third of Edward the fourth, the Market at Quéene Hithe being hindred by the slacknesse of drawing vp London Bridge, it was ordeined, that all maner of Uesselles, Shippes, or Boats, great or small, resorting to the Citie with victuall, should be sold by retaile, and that if there came but one Uessell at a time, were it salt, wheate, Kye, or other Corne from beyonde the Seas, or other graines, Garlicke, Onyons, Hearings, Sprattes, Eles, Whyting,  Place, Cods, Mackarell, &c. then that one Uessell should come to Quéene Hithe,Queen Hithe to be more frequented of Ships & botes then Billings gate. and there to make sale: but if two Uessailes came, the one should come to Quéene Hithe, the other to Billings gate: if thrée, two of them should come to Quéene Hithe, the third to Billings gate, &c. alwayes the more to Quéene Hithe: if the Uessell being great, comming with sault from the Baye, and could not come to these keyes, then the same to be conueyed by Lighters, as afore is ment.

The next is Stewe lane, of a Stewe, or hotte house there kept. After that, is Timber Hithe, or Timber stréete, so called of Timber and Boordes there taken vp and Wharffed, it is in the Parish of Saint Mary Somershithe, as I reade in the fiftie sixt of Henry the third, and in the ninth of Edward the second.

               Castle Baynard Warde.
               THe next is Castle Baynard Warde,Castle Baynard warde. so named of an olde Castle there, this Ward beginneth in the East, on the Thames side, at an house called Huntington house, and runneth West by Powles Wharffe, by Baynards Castle, Puddle Wharffe, and by the South side of Blacke Frers. Then turning by the East Wall of the sayde Fryers, to the Southwest ende of Creede Lane. Then on the North side of Thames stréete, ouer against Huntington house, by Saint Peters Church and lane, called Peter hill, along till ouer against Puddle Wharffe: and then North vp by the great Wardrobe, to the west ende of Carter lane. Then vp Creede lane, Auemary lane, and a péece of Pater Noster Rowe, to the signe of the Golden lyon, and backe againe, vp Warwicke lane, all the East side thereof, to the signe of the Crowne by Newgate Market: and this is the farthest North part of this Warde.
               Then out of Thames stréete be lanes assending North to Knightriders stréete: the first, is Peter hill lane, all of that Ward, (two houses excepted, adioyning to Saint Peters church.) The next is Powles Wharffe hill, which thwarting Knightriders stréet, and Carter lane, goeth vp to the South Chaine of Powles church yard.
               
                  Then is Adlestréete,Adlestreete. ouer against the West part of Baynards Castle, going vp by the West ende of Knightrydars stréete, and to Carter Lane. Thus much for Lanes out of Thames stréete. The one halfe of the West side of Lambard Hill Lane being of this Warde, at the Northwest ende thereof, on the South side, and at the West ende of Saint Mary Maudlins Church on the Northside, beginneth Knightridars stréete to be of this Warde, and runneth West on both sides to the Parish Church of Saint Andrew by the Wardrobe.
               Then at the said East end of S. Magdalens Church, goeth vp the Old Exchange, all the west side whereof, vp to the southeast gate of Powles church yard, and by S. Austins church, is of this Ward. About the midst of this Olde Exchaunge, on the West side thereof, is Carter Lane, which runneth West to the East entry of the Black Friars, and the south ende of Creede Lane, out of the which Carter Lane, descendeth a Lane called Doo little Lane,Do litle lane. and commeth into Knightrider stréete, by the Boores head Tauerne: and more West, is Sermon Lane, by an Inne called the Powle head. Then out of Carter Lane, on the North side thereof, the South Chaine of Powles church yarde, and the church yarde it selfe on that south side of Powles church, the church of Saint Gregory, the BiPoppes Pallace, and the Deanes lodging, be all of this Ward: and such be the boundes thereof. The Ornaments in this Ward, be Parish churches 4. Of olde time a castle: Diuers Noblemens houses. Halles of Companies twaine. And such others, as shall be shewed.
               In Thames stréete, at the Southeast end, is an auncient messuage, of olde time called Bewmounts Inne,Bewmounts Inne. as belonging to that family of Noblemen of this realme, in the 4. of Edward the 3.

Next is Powles Wharfe,Paules wharfe a large landing place, with a common staire vpon the Riuer of Thames, at the end of a stréete called Powles Wharfe Hill, which runneth downe from Powles chaine. Next is a great Messuage called Scrupes Inne,Scrupes Inne. sometime belonging to the Scrupes, in the 31. of Henry the 6.
               
                  Then is one other great Messuage sometime belonging to the Abbey of Fiscampe, beyond the Sea, and by reason of the warres, it comming to the handes of King Edward the 3. the same was giuen to Syr Symon Burley, Knight of the Garter, and therefore called Burley HouseBurley House in Thames streete, betweene Baynards Castle and Powles Wharfe.
               Then haue you Baynards Castle,Baynardes Castle. whereof this whole Ward taketh the name. This Castle Banquethe on the Riuer Thames, and was called Bainards castle, of Baynard, a noble man that came in with William the Conquerour, of the which Castle, and of Baynard himselfe, I haue spoken in an other place. There was also a Messuage by Baynardes Castle, called Legates Inne,Legates Inne. in the 7. of Edward the fourth, where be now diuers Wood Wharfes. Then is there a great Brewhouse, and Puddle Wharfe,Puddle wharfe a water gate into the Thames, where horses vse to be watered, and therfore being filed with their trampeling, and made puddle like, it is (as I suppose) called Puddle Wharfe. Then is there a Lane, betwéene the Blacke Friars and the Thames, called in the 26. of Ed. the 3. Castle Lane. In this Lane also, is one great Messuage, of olde time belonging to the Priorie of Okeborne in Wilshire, and was the Priors lodging when he repaired to London.
                  Pryor of Okebornes house. This Priory being of the French order, was suppressed by H. the 5. and with other lands and Tenements pertaining to the said Priory, was by H. the 6. giuen to his Colledge in Cambridge, called now the kings Colledge. About this Castle Lane, was sometime a Mill, or Mils, belonging to the Templars of the New Temple, as appeareth of Record: for King Iohn in the first yeare of his raigne, graunted a place on the Fléete, neare vnto Baynards Castle, to make a Mill, and the whole course of water of the Fléete, to serue the said Mill.A Mill or Mi

               I read also that in the yeare 1274. the 2. of E. the I. Ri. Rayson and Atheline his wife, did giue to Nicholas de Musely Clark, ten shillings of yearly frée and quiet rent, out of all his Tenements, with the houses therupon built, and their appurtenances, which they had of the demise of the M. and brethren of Knights Templars in England, next to their Mill of Fléete, ouer against the houses to Laurence de Brooke, in the parish of S. Andrew, next to Baynard Castle:Soke Court or Warde pertaining to Richard Fitzwater. which Tenements lyeth betwéene the way, leading towards ye said  Mill on the West part. Also in the rights belonging to Robert Fitz Water and to his heires, in the Citie of London, in the time of peace, it was declared in the yeare 1303. that the saide Robert Castillon of London, and Banner bearer, had a soke (or Warde) in the Cittie, that was by the wall of Saint Paule, as men goe downe the stréete before the Brewhouse of Saint Paule vnto the Thames, and so to the side of the Mill, which is in the water that commeth downe from Fléete Bridge, and goeth so by London walles, betwixt the Fryars Preachers Church, and Ludgate, and so runneth backe by the house of the saide Fryars, vnto the saide Common wall of the Chanory of Saint Paule: that is all of the Parish of Saint Andrew, which is in the gift of his Auncestors by senioritie, as more I haue shewed in the Castles.
               Now here is to be noted, that the walles of London at that time went straight South from Ludgate, downe to the Riuer of Thames, but for building of the Blacke-Fryars church, the saide wall in that place, was by commandement taken downe, and a new wall was then made, straight West from Ludgate to Fléete bridge, and then by the water of Fléete, to the Riuer of Thames,
&c.
               In the yeare 1307. the 35. of Edward the first, in a Parliament at Carlile, Henry Lacie Earle of Lincolne, complained of Noyances done to the water of the Fléete: Wherupon it was granted, that the said Mill should be remoued and destroyed.Mill by Baynards Castle, destroyed. This Warde ascendeth vp by the East wall of the blacke-Fryars, to the South West ende of Creede Lane, where it endeth on that side. Then to begin again on ye North side of Thames stréete ouer against Huntington house by Saint Peters Church and Lane, called Peter Hill, and so to S. Benet, Hude (or Hithe) ouer against Paules Wharfe, a proper parish Church,Parish Church of Saint Benet hard by Pauls Wharfe. which hath the Monuments of Sir W. Cheiny knight, and Margaret his wife, 1442. buried there.

This house is now all in ruine, and letten out in seuerall Tenements, yet the armes of the Lord Barkley remaine in the stone worke of an arched gate, and is betwéene a Cheuron crosses, 10. thrée, thrée, and foure.
               
                  
                  Richard Beauchampe Earle of Warwicke, was lodged in this house, then called Barklies Inne, in the Parish of Saint Andrew, in the raigne of Henry the 6. Then turning vp towards the North, is the parish church of S. Andrew in ye Wardrobe, a proper church,Parish Church of Andrew in the Wardrobe The Kinges great Wardroabe. but fewe Monuments hath it. Then is the kings great Wardrobe, I haue not read by whom the same was builded, neither when, or for what cause, but only that Sir Iohn Beauchampe, knight of ye Garter, Constable of Douer, Warden of the Sinke Ports (son to Gwido de Beauchampe, Earle of Warwicke) was lodged there: this house then bearing the name of the Kings Wardrobe, in the 5. of E. the 3. The saide Iohn Beauchampe deceased in the yeare 1359. and was buried on the South side of the middle Ile of Powles church.
               In this house of late yeares, is lodged Sir Iohn Fortescue, knight, Maister of the Wardrobe, Chancellor and vnder Treasurer of the Exchequer, and one of her Maiesties Priuy Councel. The secret letters & writings touching the estate of the realme, were wont to be introlled in the kings Wardrobe, and not in the Chauncery, as appeareth by the Records. Claus. 18. E. 4 I. Mendo, 13.

Then higher vp, neare the South chayne of Powles church yarde, is the Powle head Tauerne, which house with the appurtenances, was of olde time called Powles Brewhouse,Powles Brewhouse. for that the same was so imployed, but being since left off, and letten out.
               On the West side of this stréete, is one other great house builded of stone, which belongeth to Powles church, and was sometime letten to the Blunts Lords Mountioy, but of later time to a Colledge in Cambridge, and from them to the Doctors of the Ciuill Law and Arches, who kept a commons there, and many of them being there lodged, it is called the Doctors Commons.Doctors Commons. Aboue this on the same side, was one other great building, ouer against Powles Brewhouse, and this was called Powles Bakehouse,Powles Bakehouse. and was imploied in baking of bread, for the church of Powles. In AdlestréeteAdlestreete. or Lane, I finde no monuments.
               In Lambart hillLambart hill Lane on the West side therof, adioyning to the North side of the Blacke Smithes Hall,Black Smithes Hall, haue yee one plot of grounde inclosed with a bricke wall, for a Church yardeChurch yard of S. Mary Magdalen. or burying plot for the dead, of Saint Mary Magdalens by olde Fishstréete.
               Which was giuen to that vse, by Iohn Iwarbie an Officer in the receit of the Exchequer, in the twentie six yeare of Henry the sixt, as appeareth by patent. Iohn Iwarby &c. gaue a péece of land lying  boyde in the Parish of Saint Mary Magdalen nigh to olde Fishstréete, betwéene the Tenement of Iohn Phipot on the South, and the Tenement of Bartholomewe Burwashe on the West, and the Tenement pertayning to the Couent of Holly-well, on the North, and the waye vppon Lambards hill, on the East, for a Church-yarde to the Parson, Church Wardens, &c.
               Ouer against the North West ende of this Lambard hill Lane in Knightriders streete, is the Parish Church of Saint Mary Magdalen,
                  Parish church of S. Mary Magdalen. a small Church, hauing but fewe Monuments.
               On the West side of this Church, by the Porche thereof, is placed a Conduit,Coduit of Thames water. or Cisterne of Leade, Castelated with stone for receit of Thames water, conueyed at the charges of the before named Barnard Randolph Esquire. By the East ende of Sant Mary Magdalens Church, runneth vp the olde Exchange Lane, by the West end of Carter Lane, to the South-east gate or chayne, or of Powles Church yarde as is before shewed. And in this part was the Exchange kept, and Bullion was receiued for Coynage, as is noted in Faringdon Warde within.
               In this Parish of Saint Mary Magdalen, out of Knightriders stréet vp to Carter Lane, be two small Lanes, the one of them called Doo little Lane.Do little Lane. The other Sermon Lane, or Sheremoniers Lane,Sermon Lane. or Sheremoniers Lane. the reason of their names so giuen, I haue not learned, but I finde Sermon Lane or Sheremoniers Lane, so called in the fouretéenth of Edward the first, and a place there, to be called the blacke loft, with foure shops adioyning. I finde also that in the thirtéenth of Richard the second, William de la Pole had an house there, it may bee supposed that Lane to take name of such as cutte and rounded the plats to bee coyned into Esterling pence, for the place of Coyning was in the olde Exchaunge neare vnto this.
               In Knightriders stréete, is the Colledge of Phisitians,Colledge of Phisitians. wherin was founded in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred eightie two, a publike Lecture in Surgerye,Lecture in Chirurgery to be read. to bee read twice euery wéeke, &c. as is shewed elsewhere.
               In the South Church yard of Powles, is the South side, and  West ende of the saide church:West Gates of Powles Church. In the which West ende, be thrée stately Gates, or Entries, curiously wrought of stone, namely the middle gate, in the midst whereof, is placed a massie Pillar of brasse, wherevnto the leaues of the saide great Gate are closed and fastened, with lockes, bolts, and barres of yron: All which notwithstanding, on the 24. of December, in the yeare 1565. by a tempest of winde then rising from the West, these Gates were blowne open,Gates of Pauls church, blown open. the barres, boltes, and lockes, broken in sunder, or greatly bended. Also on the 5. of Ianuary, in the yeare 1589. by a like Tempest of winde then in the South West, the lesser West Gate of the saide church next to the Bishoppes Pallace was broken, both boltes, barres, and lockes, so that the same was blowne ouer.
               At either corner of this West ende, is also of auncient building, a strong Tower of stone, made for bell Towers, the one of them, to wit, next to the Pallace, is at this present to the vse of the same Pallace, the other towardes the South, is called the Lowlardes Tower,For Lowlards Tower, Reade M. Foxe. and hath béene vsed as the Bishoppes Prison, for such as were detected for opinions in Religion, contrary to the faith of the church.
               The last prisoner which I haue knowne committed thereto, was in the yeare 1573. one Peter Burchet,
                  Peter Burchet Gentleman of the middle Temple, for hauing desperately wounded, and minding to haue murthered a seruiceable Gentleman named Iohn Hawkens Esquire, in the high stréete neare vnto the Strande, who béeing taken and examined, was founde to holde certaine opinions erronious, and therefore committed thither, and conuicted, but in the ende by perswasion, hée promised to obiure his heresies: and was by commaundement of the Councell, remooued from thence to the Tower of London, &c. where hee committed, as in an other place I haue at large reported.
               Adioyning to this Lowlardes Tower, is the Parish church of Saint Gregorie,
                  Parish Church of S. Gregory. appoynted to the Pettie Cannons of Powles. Monuments of note I knowe none there.
               The rest of that South side of Saint Paules Church, with the Chapter House (a bewtifull péece of woorke, builded about the raigne of Edward the third) is now defaced, by meanes of  Lysences graunted to Cutlers, Budget makers, and other, first to builde lowe sheddes, but now higher Houses, which do hide that beautifull side of the Church, saue only the toppe and South Gate.
               On the North West side of this Church yarde, is the Bishoppes Pallace,The Bishops Pallace. a large thing for receipte, wherein diuers Kinges haue beene lodged, and greate housholde hath beene kepte, as appeareth by the greate Hall, whiche of late yeares since the rebatement of Bishoppes liuinges, hath not beene furnished with housholde meynie and Guestes, as was meant by the builders thereof, and was of olde time vsed.
               The Deanes lodging on the other side, directly agaynst the Pallace, is a faire olde House, and also diuers large houses, are on the same side builded, whiche yet remaine, and of olde time were the Lodgings of Prebendaries and Residenciars, whiche kept great housholdes, and liberall hospitalitie, but now either decayed, or otherwise conuerted.

                   and Faringdon extra,
                   as is afore shewed.
               
                  The bounds of which warde, without Newgate, and Ludgate, are these. First on the East part thereof, is the whole precinct of the late priorie of Saint Bartholomewe, and a part of Long Lane, on the North, towards Aldersgate stréete, and Ducke Lane, with the Hospitall of Saint Bartholomewe on the West, and all Smithfield to the Barres in S. Iohn stréete. Then out of Smithfielde, Chicken Lane toward Turmile brooke, and ouer that brooke by a bridge of timber, into the field: then backe againe by the Pens (or foldes) in Smithfield, by Smithfield pond, to Cowe-Lane, which turneth toward Oldboorne: and then Hosiar Lane, out of Smithfield, also toward Oldboorne, till it meete with a part of Cowe Lane. Then Cocke Lane out of Smithfield, ouer against Pye corner: then also is Giltspur stréete, out of Smithfield to Newgate, then from Newgate West by Saint Sepulchres church to Turnagaine Lane: then to Oldboorne conduit, on Snor hill, to Oldboorne bridge: vp Oldboorne hill to the Barres on both sides, on the right hand or North side, at the bottome of Oldboorne hill, is Gold Lane,Gold lane. sometime a filthy passage into the fieldes, now both sides builded with small tenements. Then higher is Lither Lane,Lither lane. turning also to the field, and so to the Barre. Now on the left hand or South side from Newgate, lyeth a stréet called the Olde Baily,Old Baylie. or court of the Chamberlaine of this citie: this stretcheth down by the wall of the citie vnto Ludgate: on the West side of which stréete, breaketh out one other Lane, called Saint Georges Lane, till yee come to the Southende of Seacole Lane: and then turning towards Fléetestréete, it is called Fléete Lane. The next out of the high stréete from Newgate turning down South, is called the little Baylie, and runneth downe to the East of Saint Georges Lane. Then is Seacole lane, which turneth downe into Fleetelane: neare vnto this Seacole lane,Limeburners lane, or Seacole lane. in the turning towards Oldboorne conduit, is an other lane, called in Record, windeagaine lane,Windeagaine lane. for that it turneth downe to Turmill Brooke, and from thence backe againe, for there is no way ouer. Then beyond Oldboorne bridge to Shooe lane,Shooelane. which runneth out of Oldboorne vnto the conduit in Fléetestréete. Then also is Fewtars lane,Fewtars lane. which likewise stretcheth South into Fléetestréete, by the East end of Saint Dunstons church, and from this lane to the Barres, bee the bounds without Newgate.
               
                  Now without Ludgate, this ward runneth vp from the saide gate to Temple bar, and hath on the right hand or northside, the south end of the Olde Bayly, then downe Ludgate hill, to the Fleete lane, ouer Fleete bridge, and by Shooe lane, and Fewters lane, and so to New streete (or Chancery lane) and vp that lane to the house of the Rolles, which house is also of this warde, and on the other side to a lane ouer against the Roules, which entereth Ficquetes fielde.
               Then harde by the Barre is one other lane called Shyre lane,Shire lane. because it deuideth the Citie from the Shire, and this turneth into Ficquetes fielde.
               From Ludgate againe on the left hand, or south side to Fleete bridge, to bride lane, which runneth south by Bridewell, then to Water lane, which runneth downe to the Thames.
               Then also by the White Fryars, and by the Temple, euen to the Barre aforesaide, bee the boundes of this Faringdon warde without.
               Touching Ornamentes and Antiquities in this warde, first betwixt the said Newgate and the parish Church of S.

               Beyond this Pie corner lyeth west Smithfielde,West Smithfielde. compassed about with buildinges, as first on the south side following, the right hand standeth the fayre parish church, and large Hospitall of Saint Bartilmew, founded by Rahere the first Prior of Saint Bartilmewes
                  Hospitall of S. Bartilmew. thereto neare adioyning, in the yeare 1102.
               
                  Alfune (that had not long before builded the parish church of S. Giles without Cripplegate, became the first Hospitelar, or Proctor for the poore of this house, and went himselfe dayly to the Shambles and other marketes, where he begged the charity of deuout people for their releefe, promising to the liberall giuers, (and that by alledging Testimonies of the holy scripture) reward  at the hands of God, this Hospital, was since repayred about the yeare 1423. of the goodes and by the Executors of Richarde VVhitington, sometime Maior of London, and was gouerned by a Maister, and eight Brethren, being Priestes for the church, and foure Sisters to see the poore serued.

                  This Hospitall was valued at the suppression in the yeare, 1539. the 31. of Henry the eight to 35. pounde, six shillinges, 7. pence, yearely. The church remaineth a parish church to the Tenantes dwelling in the precinct of the Hospitall,Hospitall of Bartilmew suppressed. but in the yeare 1546. on the 13. of Ianuarie, the Bishop of Rochester, preaching at Paules Crosse, declared the gift of the said king, to the Citizens for releeuing of the poore, which conteyned the Church of the Gray Fryars, the church of S. Bartilmew with the Hospitall, with all the Messuages and appurtenances in Giltspurre, alias Knightridars streete, Breton streete, Petar Kay, in the parish of S. Mary Magdalen, in olde Fishstreete, and in the parish of S. Benet Huda, Lymehurst, or Lymehost, in the Parish of Stebunheth, &c. Then also were orders deuised for releefe of the poore, the inhabitants were al called to their parish churches whereby Sir Richarde Dobbes then Maior their seuerall Aldermen, or other graue Citizens, they were by eloquent orations perswaded how great and how many commodities woulde ensew vnto them and their Citie, if the poore of diuers sorts which they named were taken from out their streets, lanes, and allies, & were bestowed and prouided for in Hospitalles abroade &c. therefore was euery man moued liberally to grant, what they woulde impart, towardes the preparing, and furnishing of such Hospitals
& also what they would contribute weekely towardes their maintenance for a time (which they saide should not be past one yeare or twaine) vntill that they were better furnished of endowment: to make short euery man granted liberally, according to his hability, and bookes were drawne of the releefe in euery warde of the City, towardes the new Hospitalles, and were deliuered by the Maior, to the kinges Commissioners, on the 17. of February, and order was taken therein, so as the 26. of Iuly, in the yeare 1552. the repayring of the Gray Fryars house, for poore fatherlesse children, was taken in hand, and also in the latter ende of the same moneth, began the repayring of this Hospitall of S. Bartilmew, and was of new endowed, and furnished at the charges of the Citizens.
               On the east side of this Hospitall, lieth Duke lane, which runneth out of Smithfielde south, to the northend of little Bretaine  streete. On the east side of this Ducke lane, and also of Smithfield lyeth the late dissolued Priorie at S. Bartilmew

               Amongst other memorable matters touching this Priorie, one is of an Archbishops visitation, which Mathew Paris hath thus. Boniface (sayth hee) Archbishoppe of Canterbury,
                  Archbishop of Canterburie visiteth Saint Bartilmewes Priorie with stripes. in his Uisitation, came to this Priorie, where being receiued with Procession, in the most solemne wise, hee saide that he passed not vpon the honor, but came to visite them, to whome the Canons anwered that they hauing a learned Bishop, ought not in contempt of him, to be visited by any other: which answere so much offended the Archbishop,Words of the Archbishop to the Prior and Canons. that hee forthwith fell on the Supprior and smote him on the face, saying, indeede, indeede doth it become you English Traitors so to answere mee, thus raging with othes not to bee recited, hee rent in peeces the rich Cope of the Supprior,Suppriors cope

               The Church and Bell Tower (hauing six Bels in a Tune) were solde to the parish of S. Sepulchers, and then the church being pulled downe to the Quire, the Quire was by the kinges order annexed for the enlarging of the olde Parish church thereto adioyning, and so was vsed till the raigne of Queene Mary, who gaue it to the Fryars Preachers or Blacke Fryars, and was vsed as their conuentuall Church, vntill the first of our Soueraigne Lady Queene Elizabeth, those Fryars were once more put out, and then all the saide church was wholie as it stoode in the last yere of Edwarde the sixt giuen by Parliament to remaine for euer a parish Church for the inhabitantes within the Close called  greate S. Bartilmewes. Since the which time, that olde Church is pulled down, except the Steeple of rotten timber ready to fall of it selfe, I haue oft heard it reported that a new steeple should be builded with the stone of the olde Parish Church, but no such thing is performed, for it is more easie to pul downe then to set vp and builde. On the North side of this Priory, is the lane, truelie called Long, which reacheth from Smithfield towards Aldersgate streete, the rest of Smithfield, from long laneLong lane. ende to the Bars is inclosed with Innes, Brewhouses, and large tenements on the west side is Chicken laneChiken lane. downe to Cowbridge.Cow bridge.
               
               Then be the PensPens in Smithfielde or Foldes so called of Sheepe there parted, and penned vp to be solde, on the market dayes.
               Then is Smithfielde Pond,Smithfielde pond some time a Poole. which of olde time in recordes was called Horse Poole, for that men watered horses there, and was a great water. In the 6. of Henry the fift, a new building was made in this west part of Smithfielde betwixt the said Poole and the Riuer of the Wels, or Turnemill Brooke, in a place (then called the Elmes,The Elmes in Smithfielde a place wherein Trespassers. were executed for that there grew many Elme trees) and this had beene the place of execution for Offendors: since the which time the building there hath beene so increased, that now remaineth not one tree growing.
               Amongst these new buildinges is Cowbridge streete, or Cow lane, which turneth toward Oldbourne, in which lane, the Prior of Semperingham had his Inne or London lodging.
               The rest of that west side of Smithfielde, hath diuers fayre Innes and other comely buildinges vp to Hosiar lane,Hosiar lane. which also turneth downe to Oldbourne, till it meete with Cowbridge street. From this lane to Cocke lane,Cocke lane ouer against Pie corner.
               And thus much for incrochmentes and inclosure of this Smithfielde, whereby remaineth but a small portion, for the olde vses, to wit, for marketes of horses and cattle, neither for Militarie exercises, and Iustinges,Iustinges in Smithfielde. Turninges, and great triumphes which haue been there performed before the Princes and Nobilitie both of this Realme, and Forraigne countries.
               But now to returne through Giltspurre streete by Newgate where I first beganne, there standeth the faire parish churchparish church of S. Sepulchre called S. Sepulchre in the Bayly, or by Chamberlaine gate in a fayre  church yarde, though not so large as of olde time, for the same is letten out for buildinges &c. This church was newly reedified or builded about the raigne of Henry the sixt,Iohn Leyland,

Sepulchers Church. was a great builder there, namely of one fayre chappell, on the south side of the Quire, as appeareth by his Armes, and other monumentes in the glasse windowes thereof, and also of the fayre Portch of the same church towardes the South, his Image fayre grauen in stone, was fixed ouer the saide Portch, but defaced and beaten downe, his title by offices was this, Chancellor of Normandy, Captain of Vernoile, Pearch, Susan, and Bayon, and Treasurer of the kinges houshold, hee dyed rich, leauing great Treasure of strange coynes and was buried in the Charterhouse church, by west Smithfield: the first nobilitating of these Pophames was by Mathild the Empresse, daughter to Henry the first, and by Henry her sonne, one Pophame gentleman of very fayre landes in Southampton shire dyed without issue male, about Henry the sixt, and leauing foure daughters they were maried to Fostar, Barentine, Wodham, & Hamdē, Popham Dean (distant 3. miles from Clarendon, & 3. miles from Motisham) was sometime the cheefe Lordshippe or Mannor house of these Pophames.
               
               There lye buried in this Church, William Andrew Esquier, Stephen Clamparde Esquier, Lawrence Warcam Esquier, Iohn Dagworth, William Porter, Esquier, Robert Scarlet Esquier
&c.
               There lyeth a streete from Newgate west, to the end of Turnagaine lane, and winding north to Oldbourne Conduite.Oldboorne Conduite by Oldboorne Crosse. This Conduite by Oldbourne Crosse was first builded 1498. Thomasin Widow to Iohn Perciuall, Maior, gaue to the second making thereof twentie markes, Richarde Shore ten pound, Thomas Kensworth and others also did giue towardes it.
               But of late a new Conduite was there builded in place of the olde, namely in the yeare one thousand fiue hundrd seauentie seauen, by William Lambe sometime a gentleman of the Chappell to king Henry the eight, and afterwarde a Cittizen and Clothworker of London, the water thereof hee caused to bee conueyed in Leade, from diuers springes to one heade and from  thence to the said Conduit, and wast of one Cocke at Oldborne bridge, more then 2000. yards in length, all which was by him performed at his owne onely charges (amounting to the summe 1500. pound) and by him finished.
               From the west side of this Conduit is the high way there called Snor hill, stretcheth out by Oldborne bridge ouer the ost named water of Turmill brooke, and so vp to Oldeborne hill, all replenished with faire building.
               Without Oldborne bridge on the right hand is Gold lane, as is afore shewed: vp higher on the hill be certaine Innes, and other faire buildings, amongst the which of olde time was a Messuage called Scrops Inne, about the 37. of Henry the sixt.
               Then is the Bishop of Elies
                  Elie place in Oldborne. Inne, commonly called Ely place, for that it pertaineth vnto the Bishops of Ely, the which Iohn de Hotham Bishoppe of Elie did giue by the name of his Mannor and sixe tenements in Oldeborne to the Church and couent of Ely, as appeareth by pattentPattent. of Record, the 9. of Edwarde the thirde. This man was 20. yeares Bishop of Elie, and deceased 1336.
               
                  Thomas Arundell Bishoppe of Elie beautifully builded of newe his Pallace at Elie, and likewise his Mannors in diuers places, especially this in Oldeborne, which he did not onely repaire but rather new builded, and augmented it with a large Port gate house, or front towards the stréet or high way: his armes are yet to be discerned in the stone worke thereof: he also sate Bishop of Ely 14. yeares, and was translated to Yorke.
               
               In this house for the large and commodious roomes thereof, diuers great and solemne feastes haue béene kept, especially by the Sergeantes at the law, whereof twaine are to be noted for posteritie. The first in the yeare 1464. the fourth of Edward the fourth in Michelmas tearme, the SergeantsSergeants feast in Elie house. at Law helde their feast in this house, to the which amongst other estates, Mathew Phillip Mayor of London, with the Aldermen, Sheriffes, and commons of diuers crafts being inuited did repaire: but when the Mayor looked to kéepe the state in the hall as it had béene vsed in all places within the Citie and liberties (out of the Kings presence) the Lord Gray of Ruthen, then Lord Treasurer of England, vnwitting the Sergeantes and against their willes (as they said) was first  placed: wherevpon the Mayor, Aldermen, and commons departed home, and the Mayor made the Aldermen to dine with him: howbeit he and all the Citizens were wonderfully displeased, that he was so dealt with, and the newe Sergeantes and others were right sorie therefore, and had rather then much good (as they said) it had not so happened.
               One other feast was likewise there kept, in the yere 1531. the 23. of king Henry the 8. the Sergeants then made were in number 11. namely, Thomas Audeley, Walter Luke, I. Bawdwine, I. Hinde, Christopher Iennie, I. Dowsell, Edward Meruine, Edmond Knightley, Roger Chomley, Edward Montague, and Roger Yorke.
               
               These also held their feast in this Elie house for fiue daies, to wit, Fryday the 10. of Nouember, Saterday, Sunday, Munday, and Tuiesday. On Munday (which was their principall day) King Henry
                  King Henry the 8. and Q. Katherine dined at the Sergeants feastes. and Quéene Katherine dined there (but in two chambers) and the forreine Ambassadors in a third chamber. In the Hall at the high table, sate Sir Nicholas Lambard Mayor of London, the Iudges, the Barons of the Exchequer, with certain Aldermen of the Citie: At the boord on the south side, sate the maister of the Rowles, the maisters of the Chauncerie, and worshipfull Citizens: On the North side of the Hall certayne Aldermen began the boorde, and then followed Merchantes of the Citie: in the Cloistrie, Chappell and gallorie, Knights, Esquires and Gentlemen were placed: in the halles, the Craftes of London: the Sergeants of Law and their wiues kept in their owne chambers.
               It were tedious to set downe the preparation of fish, flesh, and other victuailes spent in this feast, and would séeme almost incredible
& (as to me it séemeth) wanted little of a feast at a coronation: neuerthelesse a little I will touch, for declaration of the change of prices. There were brought to the slaughter house 24. great Béefes, at 26. shillings, viij.pence the péece from the shambles, one carkasse of an Oxe at 24.

Then is the Earle of Bathes Inne,The Earle of Bathes Inne., now called Bath place, of late for the most part new builded, and so to the Barres. Now againe from Newgate on the left hand or South side lyeth the Olde Bayly, which runneth downe by the wall vpon the ditch of the Citie called Hounds ditch to Ludgate: I haue not read how this streete tooke that name, but is like to haue risen of some Court of old time there kept: and I find that in the 34. of Edward the third the tenement and ground vpon Hounds ditchHounds ditch. betweene Ludgate on the South, and Newgate on the North was appointed to Iohn Cambridge Fishmonger, ChamberlaneThe Chamberlains house and court in the old Bayly. of London: whereby it seemeth that the Chamberlaines of London haue there kept their courts, as now they do by the Guildhal and till this day the Mayor and Iustices of this Cittie kept their sessions in a part thereof, now called the sessions hall,The Sessions hall. both for the cittie of London and shire of Middlesex.

               Next out of the high street turneth downe a lane, called the little Baylie, which runneth downe to the East ende of S. Georges lane. The next is Seacoale lane, I thinke called Limeburners lane,Seacoale lane, or Limeburners lane, sometime so called. of burning their lime there with Seacole. For I reade in recorde of such a lane to haue beene in the parish of S. Sepulcher, and there yet remaineth in this lane an Alley, called Limeburners Alley. Neere vnto this Seacoale lane in the turning towardes Oldborne Conduit is Turne-againe lane, or rather as in a record of the fift of Edward the third, Windagaine lane,Windagaine. lane. for that it goeth downe West to Fleete dike, from whence men must turne againe the same way that they came, for there it is stopped. Then the high stréete turneth downe Snor hill,Snore hill. to Oldborne Conduit, and from thence to Oldborne bridge, beyond the which bridge on the left hand is Shooe lane,Shooe lane. by the which men passe from Oldborn to Fleetestreete, by the Conduite there. In this Shooe lane on the left hande is one olde house called Oldborne hall,Oldborne hal. it is now letten out into diuers tenementes. On the other side at the very corner standeth the parish Church of S. Andrew,

                  . There was also of olde time (as I haue read in the third of Henry the fift) an HospitalHospitall in Oldborne. for the poore, which was a cell to the house of Cluny in Fraunce, and was therefore suppressed among the Priories Aliens.
               From this Church of S. Andrew vp Oldborne hill be diuers fayre builded houses, amongst this which on the left hande there standeth three Innes of Chauncery, whereof the first adioyning vnto Crookhorne AlleyCrokhorne Alley. is called Thaues InneThauies Inne. & standeth opposite or ouer against the said Elie house. Then is Fewter laneFewtars lane. which stretcheth south into Fleetstreet by the East end of S. Dunstones church, and is so called of Fewterers (or idle people) lying there as in a way leading to gardens: but the same is nowe of later yeares on both sides builded with many faire houses.
               Beyond the Fewters lane is Barnardes Inne,Barnards Inne 
                  alias Motworth Inne, which is the second Inne of Chauncerie, belonging to the Deane and Chapter of Lincolne, as saith the Recorde of Henry the sixt, the 32. of his raigne. Then is Staple InneStaple Inne. the thirde Inne of Chauncery, but whereof so named I am ignorant: the same of late is, for a great part thereof fayre builded, and not a little augmented: and then at the barre endeth this Ward without Newgate.
               But now without Ludgate, on the right hande or North side from the said gate lyeth the Old Bayly, as I saide: then the high streete called Ludgate hillLudgate hill. downe to Fleete lane, in which lane standeth the Fleete, a prison house, so called of the fleet or water running by it.
               I reade that Richard the first in the first of his raigne confirmed to Osbert (brother to William Longshampe Chauncelor of England and elect of Elie) and to his heires for euer the custodie of his house or palace at Westminster, with the keeping of his gaole at London, also King Iohn by his pattent dated by thirde of his raigne, gaue to S.

Then the next is Fléete bridge, pitched ouer the said water.
               Then also against the South end of Shooe lane standeth a faire water Conduite, whereof William Eastfield sometime Mayor, was founder: for the Mayor and communaltie of London being possessed of a Conduit head, with diuers springs of water gathered thereinto in the parish of Padington, and the water conueighed from thence by pypes of lead towardes London vnto Teyborne: where it had layne by the space of sixe yeares and more: The executors of Sir William Eastfield obtained licence of the Mayor and communaltie, for them in the yeare 1453. with the goodes of Sir William to conueigh the said waters: first in pipes of lead into a pipe begun to be laid besides the great Conduit heade at Maribone, which stretcheth from thence vnto a seperal late before made against the chappell of Rounseuall by Charing crosse, and no further, and then from thence to conuay the said water into the cittie, and there to make receipt or receiptes for the same vnto, for the weale common of the comminaltie, which water was by them brought thus into Fléetstréete to a standarde, which they had made and finished 1471. neere vnto Shooe lane.
               The inhabitants of Fleetestréete in the yeare 1478. obtained licence of the Mayor, Aldermen and communaltie to make at their owne charges two cesternes, the one to be set at the said standard, the other at Fleet bridgeConduite at Fleet bridge. for the receipt of the wast water: this cesterne at the standard they builded, and on the same a fayre tower of stone garnished with images of S.

And then next was sometime the house of the conuerted Iewes, founded by king Henry the third, in the yeare 1233. and the 17. of his raigne, who builded there for them a faire church, now vsed & called the chappel for the custodie of Rolles and records of Chauncerie. It standeth not farre from the olde temple, but in the midway, betwéene the old Temple and the new, in the which houseHowse of conuarts. all such Iewes and infidels as were conuerted to the Christian faith, were ordayned and appointed (vnder an honest rule of life) sufficient maintneaunce, whereby it came to passe, that in short time there were gathered a great number of conuerts, which were baptized, instucted in the doctrine of Christ, and there liued, vnder a learned Christian appointed to gouerne them: since the which time, to wit, in the yeare 1290. all the Iewes in England, were banished out of the realme, whereby the number of conuerts in this place was almost decayed: and therefore in the yeare 1377. this house was annexed by Pattent to William Burstall Clearke Custos Rotulorum or kéeper of the Rolles of the Chauncerie by Edward the third in the one and fiftieth yeare of his raigne: and this first Maister of the Rolles was sworne in Westminster hall, at the table of marble stone: since the which time, that house hath beene commonly called the Rolles in Chauncerie lane.Roules in Chauncerye Lane

                  Notwithstanding such of the Iewes or other Infidels as haue in this realme beene conuerted to christianity and baptized, haue béen relieued there: for I find in Recorde, that one William Piers a Iew that became a Christian, was baptized in the fift of Richard the second, and had two pence the day allowed him during his life by the saide king. On the West side sometime was an house pertayning to the Prior of Necton ParkePrior in Necton parke his Inne or house of the sixe Clearkes. (a house of Chanons in Lincolne shire) this was commonly called Hereflete Inne, and was a Brewhouse, but now faire builded for the sixe Clearkes of the Chauncerie, and standeth ouer against the saide house, called the Rolles, and neare vnto the lane which now entreth Fickets croft,Fickets croft Shere lane. or Fickets field. Then is Shire lane opening also into Fickets field, hard by the barres. On this North side of Fléetstréet, in the yeare of Christ 1595. I obserued, that when the laborers had broken vp the pauement, from against Chauncerie lanes end, vp towards S. Dunstones church, and had digged foure foot déepe, they found one other pauement of hard stone, more sufficient then the first, and therefore harder to be broken, vnder the which they found in the made ground, piles of timber, driuen very thicke and almost close together the same being as blacke as pitch or coale, and many of them rotten as earth, which prooueth that the ground there (as sundry other places of the Cittie) haue beene a marish or full of springes.
               Now on the South side from Ludgate be faire builded houses to Fléete bridge,Conduit at Fleet bridge. on the which bridge a Cesterne for receite of spring water was made by the men of Fléetestréete, but the watercourse is decaied and not restored.
               Next is Bridelane, and therein Bridewell, of olde time the Kinges house:Bridewell the kings house. for the Kinges of this Realme haue beene there lodged, and their Courtes of lawe haue béene there kept of olde time, to wit till the ninth of Henry the thirde, the Courtes were kept in the kings house whersoeuer he was lodged, as may appeare by auncient records, whereof I haue seene many, but as for example I haue already set forth one, in the Chapter of Towers and Castels before.Liber Burton snper Trenthā fol. 46.
               
               King Henry the eight builded there a stately and beautifull house of new, for receit of the Emperor Charles the 5. who in the  yeare of Christ 1522. was lodged himselfe at the Blacke Fryars, but his Nobles in this new builded Bridewell, a Gallery being made out of the house ouer the water, and through the wall of the Cittie into the Emperors lodging, at the Blacke Fryars, king Henry himselfe oftentimes lodged there also, as namely in the yere 1525. a Parliament being then holden in the Blacke Fryars, he created StatesStates created at Bridewell. of Nobilitie there, to wit, Henry Fitz Roy, a childe (which he had by Elizabeth Blunt) to bee Earle of Nottingham, Duke of Richmont, and of Somerset, Leiuetenante Generall, from Trent Northwarde, Warden of the East, middle, and West Marches for Anenst Scotland.

               In the yeare 1528. Cardinall Campeius was brought to the kinges presence being then at Bridewell, whether hee had called all his Nobility, Iudges and Councellors &c. And there the eight of Nouember in his great Chamber he made vnto them an oration touching his marriage with Queene Katheren, as yee may read in Edward Hall.
               
               In the yeare 1529. the same king Henry and Queene Katherine were lodged there, whilest the question of their marriage was argued in the Blacke Fryars &c.
               But now you shall heare how this house became a house of correction. In the yeare 1553. the seauenth of king Edwarde the sixt, the tenth of Aprill, Sir George Baron (being Maior of this Citie) was sent for to the Court at White hall, and there at that time the king gaue vnto him, for the Comminaltie and Citizens to bee a Workehouse for the pooreBridewell giuē to the Citie of London, to be a workehouse for the poore. and idle persons of the Citie, his house of Bridewell, and 700. markes land late of the possessions of the house of the Sauoy, and all the bedding and other furniture of the saide Hospitall of the Sauoy towardes the maintenance  of the saide Workehouse of Bridewell, and the Hospitall of S.

               This gift king Edwarde confirmed by his Charter, dated the 26. of Iune next following, and in the yeare 1555. in the moneth of Februarie Sir William Gerrarde Maior and the Aldermen entred Bridewell, and tooke possession thereof according to the gift of the saide king Edwarde, the same was also confirmed by Queene Mary.
               
               The Bishop of S. Dauides
                  The Bishoppe of S. Dauides house. had his Inne ouer against the north side of this Bridewell (as I haue heard.)
               Then is the parish church of S. Bridget
                  Parish church of S. Bridget. or S. Bride, (as they terme it) now a fayre church, the which William Venor Esquier, Warden of the Fleete aboute the yeare 1480 increased with a large body, and side Isles from the Quire (which of olde time was the whole Church) downe to the west end, all through this Church builded of his charges is wrought in the stone worke, round about both within and without, the figure or likenes of a vine with Clusters of Grapes amongst the leaues &c.

               In place of this Fryars church bee now many fayre houses builded, lodginges for noble men and others. Then is the Sarieantes Inne,Sarieants Inne in Fleetstreete. so called for that diuers Iudges and Sarieantes at the Law, keepe a Commons, and are lodged there in Terme times. Next is the New Temple,New Temple. so called because the Templars before the building of this house, had their Temple in Oldborne. This house was founded by the knightes Templars in England, in the raigne of Henry the second, and the same was dedicated to God and our blessed Lady, by Heraclius, Patriarke of the Church, called the holy resurrection in Iherusalem, in the yeare of Christ, 1185.
               These knightes TemplarsOriginall of the Thmplars. tooke their beginning about the yeare 1118. in manner following. Certaine noble men, horsemen, religiously bent, bound by vow themselues in the handes of the Patriarke of Iherusalem, to serue Christ after the manner of Regular Chanons in chastitie & obedience, and to renounce their own proper wils for euer: she first of which order were Hugh Paganus, and Geffery de S. Andomare. And whereas at the first they had no certaine habitation, Baldwin king of Ierusalem, granted vnto them a dwelling place in his Pallace, by the Temple, and the Chanons of the same Temple, gaue them the streete thereby to build there in their houses of office, and the Patriarke, the king, the Nobles, and Prelates: gaue vnto them certaine reuenewes out of their Lordshippes.
               Their first professionProfession of the Templars. was for safegarde of the Pilgrimes comming to visite the Sepulchre and to keepe the high waies against  the lying in waite of Theeues, &c. About ten yeares after they had a rule appointed vnto them, and a white Habite by Honorius then Pope, and whereas they had been but nine in number, they beganne to increase greatly. Afterwarde in Pope Eugenius time, they bare crosses of red cloth on their vppermost garmentes, to be knowne by from others: and in short time because they had their first mansion hard by the Temple of our Lord in Ierusalem, they were called knightes of the Temple.
               Many noble men in all parts of Christendome, became Brethren of this order, and builded for themselues Temples in euery citie or great Towne. In England this was their cheise house, which they builded after the forme of the Temple, neare to the sepulchre of our Lord at Ierusalem,Mathew Par

                     s. they had also an other Temple in Cambridge, one other in Bristow, in Canterbury, Douer, Warwicke, & others in other places. This Temple in London, was often made a storehouse of mens Treasure, I meane such as feared the spoile there of in other places.
               
                  Mathew Paris noteth that in the yeare 1232. Huberte de Burgh Earle of Kent, being Prisoner in the Tower of London, the king was enformed that hee had much Treasure layde vp in his new Temple, vnder the custody of the Templars, whereupon he sent for the maister of the Temple, and examined him straightlie, who confessed that money being deliuered vnto him and his Brethren to be kept, he knew not how much there was of it, the king demanded to haue the same deliuered, but it was answered that the money being committed vnto their trust, could not be deliuered without the licence of him that committed it, to Ecclesiasticall protection, whereupon the king sent his Treasurer and Iusticiar of the Exchequer vnto Hubert to require him to resigne the money wholy into his handes, who answered that he would gladly submit himselfe, and all his vnto the kinges pleasure, and thereupon desired the knightes of the Temple in his behalfe to present all the keyes vnto the king
                     •
                   to doe his pleasure, with the goodes which he had committed vnto them. Then the king commanded the money to be faithfully tolde and laide vp in his Treasure, by Inuentorie, wherein was found (besides readie money) vessels of gold, and siluer vnpraiseable, and many pretio

               This Temple was againe dedicated 1240. belike also newlie reedified then.
               These Templars at this time were in so great glorie, that they entertayned the Nobilitie, forraine Ambassadors, and the Prince himselfe, very often, insomuch that Mathew Paris crieth out on them for their Pride, who being at the first so poore, as they had but one horse to serue two of them, (in tokē whereof they gaue in their Seale,Seale of the Templars. two men riding vpon one horse,) yet suddainely they waxed so insolent, that they disdayned other orders, and sorted themselues with Noble men.
               King Edwarde the first in the yeare 1163. taking with him Robert Waleran, and other came to the Temple, where calling for the Keeper of the Treasure house, as if hee ment to see his mothers Iewels, that were laide vp there, to bee safely kept hee entred into the house, breaking the Coffers of certaine persons that had likewise brought their money thether, and hee tooke away from thence to the valew of a thousand pound.
               Many ParliamentesParliament at the New Temple. and great Counsailes haue been there kept as may appeare by our histories. In the yeare 1308. all the Templars in England as also in other parts of Christendome were apprehended and committed to diuers prisons, In 1310. a prouinciall Counsaile was holden at London against the Templars, in England, vpon heresie, and other Articles whereof they were accused, but denied all except one or two of them, notwithstanding they all did confesse that they coulde not purge themselues fully, as faultles, and so they were condemned to perpetuall pennance, in seuerall monasteries, where they behaued themselues modestly.
               
                  Phillip king of France procured their ouerthrow, throughout the whole world, and caused them to be condemnedThe order of Templars condemned. by a generall Counsaile to his aduantage, as he thought, for he beleeued to haue had all their landes in France, and therefore seazed the same into his handes, (as I haue read) caused the Templars to the number of foure and fifty, (or after Fabian threescore) to bee burned atTemplars burned.

(sayeth Some) Hugh Spencer, vsurping the same held it during his life, by whose death it came againe to the handes of Edwarde the thirde, but in the meane time to wit, 1324. by a Counsaile holden at Vienna, all the landes of the Templars (least the same should be put to prophane vses) were giuen to the knightes Hospitelars of the order of S.

I am now to crosse ouer the said Riuer into the Borough of Southwarke, which is also a Warde of London, without the walles, on the south side thereof, as is Portsoken on the East, and Faringdon extra on the West.
               This Borough being in the countie of Surrey, consisteth of diuers stréetes, wayes, and winding lanes, all full of buildings, inhabited: and first to begin at the West part thereof, ouer against the West suburbe of the Citie.
               On the banke of the riuer Thames, there is now a continuall building of tenementes, about halfe a mile in length to the bridge. Then from the bridge straight towardes the South a continuall stréete, called long Southwarke, builded on both sides with diuers lanes and alleyes vp to S. Georges church, and beyond it through Blackman stréete, towardes new towne, (or Newington) the liberties of which Borough extend almost to the parish Church of New towne, aforesaid distant one mile from London bridge: and also Southwest almost to Lambith more then one mile from the said bridge. Then from the bridge along by the Thames Eastwardes is S. Olaues stréetS. Olaues street. hauing continuall building on both the sides, with lanes and alleyes vp to Battle bridge, to Horsedowne, and towardes Rother hith: also some good halfe mile in length from London bridge.
               So that I accompt the whole continual buildings on the banke of the said riuer, from the West towardes the East to be more then a large mile in length.
               Then haue ye from the entring towards the saide Horsedowne one other continuall street called Bermondes eye stréete, which stretcheth South, likewise furnished with buildings on both sides, almost halfe a mile in length, vp to the late dissolued Monasterie  of S. Sauiour called Bermondsey. And from thence is one long lane (so called of the length) turning West to Saint Georges church afore named. Out of the which late mentioned long lane breaketh one other street towardes the South, and by East, and this is called Kentish stréet, for that it is the way leading into that countrey: and so haue you the boundes of this Borough.
               The Antiquities most notable in this Borough are these: first for ecclesiasticall, there was Beremondsey, an AbbeyAn Abbey. of blacke Monkes, S.

               The Kings Bench.
               And the White Lyon, all in long Southwarke.
               Houses most notable be these.

As also Mastiues in seuerall kenels are there nourished to bait them. These Beares and other beastes are there bayted in plottes of grounde, scaffolded about for the beholders to stand safe.

Amongst the which, these following were some, viz. That no stewholder or his wife should let or stay any single woman to go and come fréely at all times when they listed.
               No stewholder to keepe any woman to borde, but she to borde abroad at her pleasure.
               To take no more for the womans chamber in the wéeke then fourtéene pence.
               Not to keepe open his dores vpon the holy daies.
               Not to keepe any single woman in his house on the holy daies, but the Bailiefe to sée them voided out to the Lordship.
               No single woman to be kept against her will that would leaue her sinne.
               No stewholder to receiue any woman of religion, or any mans wife.

                  No Stewholder to keepe any woman that hath the perillous infirmitie of burning, nor to sell bread, ale, flesh, fish, wood, coale or any victuailes, &c.
               These and many more orders were to be obserued, vpon great payne and punishment: I haue also séene diuers Pattents of confirmation,

This Church or some other in place thereof was of olde time (long before the conquest) an house of sisters, founded by a maiden named Mary, vnto the which house and sisters she left (as was left to her by her parentes) the ouersight, and profites of a crosse ferrie or trauerse ferrie ouer the Thames, there kept before that any bridge was builded. This house of sisters was after by Swithen, a noble Ladie, conuerted vnto a Colledge of Priestes, who in place of the ferrie builded a bridge of timber, and from time to time kept the same in good reparations, but lastly the same bridge was builded of stone, and then was this church againe founded for Channons Regular, by William Pont de le Arche, and William Dauncy, Knightes, Normans.
               
               
                  William Gifford Bishop of Winchester was a good benefactor  also: for hee (as some haue noted) builded the bodie of that church in the years 1106. the seuenth of Henry the first.
               The Cannons first entred the said Church then.Liber Rufen. Liber Bermondsey.

               King Stephen confirmed the gift of king Henry, and also gaue the stone house, which was Williams de Pont le Arche by Downegate.
               This Priorie was burned about the yere 1207. wherefore the Chanons did found an Hospitall néere vnto their Priorie, where they celebrated vntill the Priorie was repaired: which Hospitall was after by consent of Peter de la Roch Bishop of Winchester remoued into the lande of Anicius Archdeacon of Surrey in the yeare 1228. a place where the water was more plentifull, and the ayre more holesome, and was dedicate to S.

               This Church was againe newly builded, in the raigne of Richard the second and King Henry the fourth.
               
                  Iohn Gower
                  Iohn Gower was no knight neither had he any garland of Iuie & Roses but a Chaplet of foure Roses onely. a learned Gentleman and a famous Poet, (but no knight as some haue mistaken it) was then as especiall benefactor to that worke, and was there buried on the North side of the said church vnder a tombe of stone, with his image also of stone lying ouer him: The haire of his heade aburne, long to his sholders, but curling vp, a small forked bearde, and on his head a chaplet, like a Coronet of foure Roses, therevpon an habite of purple, damasked downe to his féet, a collar of Esses gold about his necke, vnder his heade the likenesse of thrée bookes, which hee compiled. The first named Speculum Meditantis, written in French: The second Vox clamantis penned in Latine. The third Confessio Amantis, set forth in English.
               This Priorie was surrendred to Henry the eight, the 31. of his raigne, the 27. of October, the yeare of Christ 1539. and was valued at 624. pounde, sixe shillinges sixe pence by the yeare.  About Christmasse next following, the church of the saide Priorie was purchased of the King by the inhabitantes of the Borough. Doctor Stephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester putting to his helping hande, they made thereof a parish church,Priorie of S. Marie Ouery made a parish church. for the parish church of S. Mary Magdalen, on the south side of the said quire, and of S. Margaret on the hill which were made one parish of S. Sauiour.
               
               There be monumentes in this Church of Robert Liliarde or Hiliarde Esquire, Margaret daughter to the Ladie Audley, wife to Sir Thomas Audley, Margaret wife to William Greuell Esquire, and one of the heyres of William Spershut Esquire, William Greuel Esquire, Dame Katherine wife to Iohn Stoke Alderman, Robert Merfin Esquire, William Vndall Esquire, Lord Ospay Ferrar, Sir George Brewes Knight, Iohn Browne, Ladie Brandon, wife to Sir Thomas Brandon, William Lorde Scales, William Earle Warren, Dame Maud wife to Sir Iohn Peach, Lewknor, Dame Margaret Elrington, one of the heires of Sir Thomas Elrington, Iohn Bowden Esquire, Robert, S.

               Now passing through S. Mary Ouers close,S. Mary Ouers Close. (in possession of the Lord Mountacute) and Pepper AlleyPepper Alley. into long Southwarke, on the right hand thereof the Market hill, where the leather is solde, there stood the late named parish church of S. Margaret,
                  S. Margaret on the hill made a Court of Iustice. giuen to S. Mary Oueries by Henry the first, put downe and ioyned with the parish of S. Mary Magdaline, and vnited to the late dissolued Priorie church of S. Mary Ouery.
               
               A part of this parish church of S. Margaret is now a Court, & wherein the Assises & sessions be kept, and the Court of AdmiraltieCourt of Admiraltie. is also there kept. One other part of the same church is now a prison called the Compter in Southwarke,Compter in Southwarke. &c.
               Farther vp on that side, almost directly ouer against S. Georges church was sometime a large and most sumptuous house, builded by Charles Brandon late Duke of Suffolke, in the raign of Henry the eight, which was called Suffolke house,Suffolke house but comming afterwardes into the Kinges hands, the same was called Southwarke place, and a MintA mint in Southwarke. of coynage was there kept for the king.
               
                   To this place came king Edward the sixt, in the seconde of his raigne, from Hampton Court, and dined in it. He at which time made Iohn Yorke one of the Sheriffes of London knight, and then rode through the cittie to Westminster.
               
               Queene Mary gaue this house to Nicholas Heth Archbishop of Yorke, and to his successors for euer, so be their Inne (or lodging for their repaire to London in recompence of Yorke house neare to Westminster, which King Henry her father had taken from Cardinall Wolsey, and from the sea of Yorke.
               
               Archbishop Heth hath sold the same house to a merchant, or to certaine merchants, that pulled it downe, sold the lead, stone, iron
&c. And in place therof builded many small cottages of great rents, to the increasing of beggers in that Burrough. The Archbishop bought Norwich house, or Suffolke place, neere vnto Charing Crosse, because it was neere vnto the Court, and left it to his successors. Now on the south side to returne back again towards the bridge. Ouer against this Suffolke lane is the parrish Church of S. George,
                  Parish church of S. George. sometime pertayning to the Priorie of Barmondsey, by the gift of Thomas Arderne, and Thomas his sonne, in the yeare 1122. There lie buried in this Church William Kerton Esquire, and his wiues 1464.
               Then is the white Lyon a GaoleWhite Lion a Gaole for Surrey. so called, for that the same was a common hosterie for the receit of trauellers by that signe: This house was first vsed as a Gaole within these fortie yeares last, since the which time the prisoners were once remoued thence to an house in Newtowne, where they remained for a short time, and were returned backe again to the foresaid White Lyon, there to remaine as in the appointed Gaole for the Countie of Surrey.
               
               Next is the Gaole or prison of the kinges Benche,Kings Bench. but of what antiquitie the same is I knowe not. For I haue read that the Courts of the Kings Bench and Chauncery haue oft times béene remoued from London to other places, and so hath likewise the Gayles that serue those courtes, as in the yeare 1304, Edwarde the first commanded the Courtes of the kings Bench and the Exchequer, which had remained seuen yeares at Yorke, to be remoued to their old places at London. And in the yeare 1387. the 11. of Richard the 2. Robert Trasilian chief Iustice came to y• city of  
                  Couentry, and there sate by the space of a moneth, as Iustice of the kings Benches, and caused to be indighted in that Court, about the number of two thousand persons of that country, &c.H. Kinghlon.
               
               It séemeth therefore, that for that time, the prison or gayle of that court was not farre off. Also in the yeare 1392. the sixtéenth of the same Richard, the Archbishop of Yorke, beeing Lord Chauncelor, for good will that he bare to his citie, caused the Kings Bench and Chauncery to be remooued from London to Yorke, but ere long they were returned to London.
               
               Then is the MarshalseyMarshalsey in Southwarke. an other Gayle or prison, so called, as pertayning to the Marshalles of England. Of what continuaunce kept in Southwarke I haue not learned: but like it is, that the same hath beene remoueable, at the pleasure of the Marshalles: for I finde, that in the yeare, one thousand thrée hundred seuentie sixe, the fiftieth of Edward the third, Henry Percy (béeing Marshall) kept his prisoners in the citie of London, where hauing committed one Iohn Prendargest, of Norwiche, contrary to the liberties of the Cittie of London, the citizens (by perswasion of the Lord Fitzwalter theyr Standart-bearer) tooke Armour and ranne with great rage to the Marshalles Inne, brake vp the gates, brought out the prisoner, and conueyed him away, minding to haue brent the Stockes in the middest of their citie, but they first sought for sir Henry Percy to haue punished him, as I haue noted in my Annalles.
               More, about the Feast of Easter next following, Iohn Duke of Lancaster, hauing caused all the whole Nauy of England, to bee gathered togither at London: It chaunced a certaine Esquire, to kill one of the ship men, which act, the other shipmen taking in ill part, they brought their suite into the kings court of the Marshalsey, which then as chaunsed (saith mine Author) was kept in Southwarke: but when they perceiued that Court to bee too fauourable to the murtherer, and further, that the Kings warrant was also gotten for his pardon, they in great furie ranne to the house, wherein the murtherer was imprisoned, brake into it,Saylers brake vp the Marshalsey. and brought forth the prisoner, with his Gyues on his legges: then thrust they a knife to his heart, and sticked him, as if he had béene a  Hogge, then after this, they tyed a rope to his Gyues, and drew him to the gallowes, where when they hanged him, as though they had done a great act, they caused the Trompettes to bee sounded before them to theyr Shippes, and there in great triumphe they spent the rest of the day.
               Also the Rebels of Kent,
                  Rebels of Kent brake vp the Marshalsey. in the yeare 1381. brake downe the houses of the Marshalsey, and Kings Bench in Southwarke, tooke from thence the prisoners, brake downe the house of Sir Iohn Imworth, then Marshall of the Marshalsey, and Kings Bench, &c. After this, in the yeare, 1387. the eleuenth of Richard the second, the morrow after Bartholomewe day, the King kept a great Councell in the Castle of Nottingham, and the Marshalsey of the King, was then kept at Lugborough, by the space of sixe dayes or more. In the yeare 1443. Sir Walter Many was Marshall of the Marshalsey, the twentie two of Henry the sixt. In the yeare 1504 the prisoners of the Marshalsey (then in Southwarke) brake out, and many of them béeing taken, were executed, especially such as had béene committed for Felony or Treason. From thence, towards London Bridge, on the same side, be many fayre Innes, for receipt of trauellers, by these signes: the Spurre, Christopher, Bull, Quéenes head, Tabarde,The Tabarde in Southwarke. George, Harte, Kings head, &c. Amongst the which, the most auncient, is the Tabard, so called of the signe, which (as we now terme it) is of a Iacquit, or sléeuel

               This house séemeth to haue taken beginning, with the first founding of the bridge either of stone or timber: it is a large plot of ground, on the banque of the Riuer Thames: containing diuers large buildings, for stowage of things necessarie, towards reparation of the said bridge.

Much other buildings of small tenements are thereon builded, replenished with strangers and other, for the most part poore people.
               Then is Battaile bridge,Battaile bridge. so called of Battaile Abbey, for that it standeth on the ground, and ouer a water course (flowing out of Thames) pertaining to that Abbey, and was therefore both builded and repaired, by the Abbots of that house, as being hard adioyning to the Abbots lodging.

               The Suburbes without the Walles of the Citie, briefly touched. As also without the Liberties, more at large described.
               HAuing spoken of this citie, the originall, and increase, by degrées. The Walls, Gates, Dich, Castles, Towers, Bridges, the Schooles and Houses of learning. Of the Orders and Customes, Sports and Pastimes. Of the honour of Citizens, and worthinesse of the men. And last of all, how the same Citie. is diuided into parts and Wards. And how the same be bounded. And what Monuments of antiquitie, or Ornaments of building be in euery of thē, as also in the Borough of Southwarke. I am next to speak briefly of the Suburbs, as well without the gates and walles, as without the Liberties. And of the Monuments in them.
               Concerning the estate of the Suburbs of this Citie, in the raigne of H. the 2. Eitz Stephens
                  Fitz Stephens. hath these words. Upwards on the West (saith he) is the Kings Pallace, which is an incomparable building, rising with a Uawmure & Bulwark. Aloft vpon the riuer, two myles from the wall of the citie, but yet conioyned with a continuall Suburbe. On all sides, without the houses of the Suburbes, are the citizens Gardens and Orchards, planted with trées, both large, sightly, and adioyning togither. On the North side, are pastures, & plaine medows, with brookes running through them, turning water mils, with a pleasant noyse. Not far off, is a great Forrest, A well wodded Chase, hauing good couert for Harts, Buckes, Does, Boores, and wilde bulles. The corne fields are not of a hungry sandie mould, but as the fruitfull fields of Asia: yéelding plentifull encrease, and filling the barnes with corne. There are neare London on the North side, especiall welles in the Subburbes, swéete, holesome, and cleare. Amongst which, Holywell, Clarkenwell, and S. Clemons well, are  most famous, and most frequented, by schollers & youthes of y• citie in Summer euenings, when they walke forth to take the ayre. Thus farre out of Fitz Stephen, for the Subburbes at that time.Libar albo. The 2. yeare of H. the 3. the Forrest of Midlesex, and the Warren of Stanes were disaforested: since the which time, the Subburbs about London hath bin also mightily increased with buildings: for first, to begin in the East, by the Tower of London,
                  Subburbe with out the Posterne by the Tower of Lon. Wapping in the Wose. is the Hospitall of S. Kathren, founded by Matilde the Quéene, wife to King Stephen, as is afore shewed in Porsoken Warde, from this Precinct of Saint Kathren, to Wapping in the Wose, and Wapping it selfe, (the vsuall place of Execution for the hanging of Pyrates and sea Rouers, at the lowe water marke, and there to remaine, till thrée Tydes had ouerflowed them) and neuer a house standing within these fortie yeares, but is now made a continuall stréete, or rather a filthy straight passage, with Lanes and Allyes, of small Tenements inhabited by Saylors, and Uictuallers, along by the Riuer of Thames, almost to Radliffe, a good myle from the Tower.
               Now on the East side, and by North of the Tower, lyeth East-Smithfield, Hogs stréete, and Tower hill: and East from them both, was the New Abbeycalled Grace, founded by Edward the third. From thence towards Radliffe, vp East Smithfielde, by Nightingale LaneNightingale Lane. (which runneth South by the Hermitage,The hermitage by S. Kathrēs. Villa Estsmith field and Villa de Brambly. to Wapping) to the maner of Brambley, called in the records of Richard the second, Vila East Smithfield, and Villa de Brambley.
               
               Not farre from thence, of very late, (where of olde time, stoode the mannor of Shadwell,
                  Mannor of Shadwell. belonging to the Deane of Powles, there haue béene raised many small Tenements towards Radliffe:Radliffe. and Radliffe it selfe, hath bin so increased in building Eastward (in place where, I haue knowne faire hedges, long rowes of Elme, and other trées) that the same haue now taken hold of Lime hurst,Limehurst. (or Lime hoste it selfe) commonly called Lime house, sometime distant a mile from Radliffe, &c.
               Now for Tower hill:Tower Hall without the Walles. the plaine there, is likewise greatly diminished, by incrochments for building of small tenements, and taking in of garden plots, timbaryars, or what they list.  From this Tower Hill towards Aldegate, (being a long continuall streete) amongst other buildings, was that Abbey of Nunnes, called the Minorities, or Minories, whereof I haue spoken. And on the other side of that stréete, lyeth the Ditche, without the wall of the Citie, from the Tower vnto Aldegate.
               From Aldegate East,Suburbe without Aldegate. againe lyeth a large stréete, replenished with buildings: to wit, on the North side, the parish church of Saint Buttolphe, and so other buildings to Hog Lane, and to the Barres on both the sides. Also without the Barres, both the sides of the stréet be pestered with Cotages & Allies, euen vp to white Chapple church: and almost halfe a myle beyond it, into the common field: all which ought to lye open & frée for all men. But this common field, I say, being sometimes the beautie of this Citie on that part, is so incroched vpon by building of filthy Cotages, and with other prepesterous like inclosures and Laystalles, (that notwithstanding all Proclamations and Acts of Parliament made to the contrary) that in some places it scarce remaineth a sufficient high way for the méeting of Carriages and droues of Cattel, much lesse is there any faire, pleasant, or wholsome way for people to walk on foote: which is no small blemish to so famous a citie, to haue so vnsauery and vnséemly an entry or passage therunto. Now of white ChapleOf white Chapple. Church somwhat, & thē back again to Aldegate. This church is as it were a chapple of

                  S. Mary Matfellon. vpon this occasiō following. About the yeare 1428. the 6. of King H. the 6. A deuout WidowA deuout widow murdered of that parish had long time cherished, and brought vp of Almes, a certaine Frenchman or Briton borne, which most vnkindly & cruelly, in a night murthered the said widow sléeping in her bed, and after fled with such Iewels & other stuffe of hers as he might carry: but he was so freshly pursued, that for feare he tooke the church of S. George in Southwarke, and challenged priuiledge of Sanctuary there, and so abiured ye Kings land. Then the Constables (hauing charge of him) brought him into London, intending to haue conueyed him Eastward) but so soone as he was come into the Parish, where before he had committed the murther, the wiues cast vpon him so much filth and ordure of the stréete, that (notwithstanding the best resistance  made by the Constables,) they slew him out of hand: And for this fact, that Parish purchased the name of Mary Mat-fellon. Now againe from Algegate, Northwest to Bishops gate,Suburbe with-Bishops gate. lyeth Howndes Ditche, and so to Bishops gate. North and by East from Bishops gate, lyeth a large stréete or high way, hauing on the West side therof, the Parish church of S. Buttolphe. Then is the Hospitall of S.

This Priory was valued at the suppression, to haue of landes 293.li. by yeare, and was surrendred 1539. in the 31. of H. the 8. The church therof being pulled downe, many houses haue bene their builded for the lodgings of Noble men, of straungers borne, and other. And neare thereunto, are builded two publique houses for the acting and shewe of Comedies, Tragedies, and Histories, for recreation. Whereof the one is called the Courtein,
                  The Courtin. the other the Theatre:
                  The Theatre. both standing on the Southwest side towards the field.
               From Hollywell in the high stréete, is a continuall building of Tenements to Sors Ditche, or Sewers Ditche, sauing one small side of a fielde, alreadie made a Gardein plotte. Ouer against the North corner of this field, betwéene it and the church of S. Leonarde in Soersditch, sometime stood a Crosse, now a Smithes Forge,A Crosse at Soersditch, now a Smithes Forge. diuiding thrée wayes: foorth right the high way, is builded vpon either side, more then a good flight shot, towards Kings Land, Newington, Totenham, &c.
               
               On the left hand is Ealdestréete, which reacheth West to a stone Crosse, ouer against the North ende of Grubstréete, and so to the end of Goswell stréet. On the right hand of this Ealdestréete, not farre from Soers Ditch, but on the North side thereof is Hoxton,
                  Hoxton. a long stréete, with houses on both sides, and is a Prebend belonging to Powles church in London, but of Soers ditch parish.
               
                   On the right hand beyond Soersditch Church toward Hackney, are some late builded houses vpon the common soyle (for it was a Laystall) belonging to the Parish of Stebinhithe. On the other side of the high way, from Bishopsgate and Hownsditch, the first building is a large Inne for receipt of Trauellers: then a faire house lately builded by the Lorde Iohn Powlet. Next to that, a large house, with Gardens of pleasure, builded by Iasper Eisher. From this vp to the West ende of Hog Lane, is a continuall building of small cottages.
               Then was the Hospitall called Saint Mary Spittle, harde within the Barres, whereof I haue spoken, in Bishopsgate Ward. From the which Barres towards Soersditch, is all along a continued building of small and base Tenements, for the most part lately erected. Amongst the which (I meane of the auncientest buildings) was one rowe of proper small housesAlmes houses in Soersditch. with Gardens for poore decaied people, there placed by the Pryor of the saide Hospitall: euery one Tennant whereof, paide one penny Rent by the yeare at Christmas: and dyned with the Pryor on Christmas day: but after the suppression of the Hospitall, these houses (for want of reparations) in fewe yeares were so decaied, that it was called Rotten Rowe:
                  Rotten Rowe, or Russel Row. and the poore worne out (for there came no new in their place) the houses were solde from Goddard, to Russell a Draper, who new builded them, and let them out for Rent inough, taking also large Fines of the Tenants, (which some thinke to be neare as much as the houses cost him in the purchase, and building: for he made his bargaines so hardly with all men, that both Carpenter, Bricklayer, and Playsterer, were by that worke vtterly vndone.

This Fen or Moore field, stretching from the wall of the citie, betwixt Bishopsgate and the Posterne called Criples gate, to Fensberry, and so to Holywell, continued a waste and vnprofitable grounde, a long time, so that the same was all letten for foure Markes the yeare, in the raigne of Edward the 2. But in the yeare 1415. the 3. of Henry the 5. Thomas Fawconer Mayor, as I haue shewed, caused the wall of the Citie to be broken toward the saide Moore, and builded the Posterne called Mooregate, for the ease of the Citizens, to walke that way vpon Causwayes into the fieldes towards Iseldon and Hoxton. Moreouer, he caused the Ditche of the Citie, and other Ditches thereabout, to be new cast and clensed, by meane whereof, the said Fen or Moore was greatly dreyned and dried. And shortly after, to wit, 1477. Raphe Ioceline Mayor, for repairing of the wall of this Cittie, caused the saide Moore to bee searched for Clay and Bricke to be brent there, &c. by which means this field was made the worse for a long time.

Roger Archley Mayor, caused diuers Dikes to be cast, and made to drene the waters of the saide Moore fields,Ditches cast to dreine the Moore Field. with Bridges Arched ouer them, and the grounds about to be leuelled, whereby the saide fielde was made somewhat more commodious, but yet it stood full of noysome waters: Wherepon in the yeare 1527.  Sir Thomas Semor Mayor, caused diuers SlewcesSlewces to conuey the standing water out of the Moore. to be made, to conuey the sayde waters, ouer the Towne Ditch, into the course of Walbrooke, and so into the Thames: and by these degrées, was this Fenne or Moore, at length made maine and hard ground, which before béeing ouergrowne with Flagges, Sedges, & Rushes, serued to no vse, since the which time, also the further groundes beyond Fensbury Court, haue béene so ouerheigthned with Laystalles of Doong, that now thrée windmilles are thereon:Moorefielde raised, & windmilles set thereon. the ditches be filled vp, and the bridges ouerwhelmed.

This saying so greeued the Londoners, that suddainly this yeare, a great number of the Citie, assembled themselues in a morning, and a Turner in a fooles coate, came crying through the cittie, shouelles and spades, shouelles and spades: so many of the people followed, that it was a woonder to behold: and within a short space al the hedgesHedges pulled downe and diches filled vp. about the Citie were cast downe, and the diches filled vp, and euery thing made plaine, such was the diligence of these workemen. The kings counsaile hearing of this assembly, came to the gray Fryers, and sent for the Mayor, and councell of the citie, to know the cause, which declared to them, the iniurie and annoying done to the citizens, and to their liberties, which though they would not séeke disorderly to redresse, yet the communaltie and young persons could not be stayed, thus to remedy the same: whē the kings counsaile had heard their answer, they dissimuled the matter, and commanded the Mayor to sée that no other thing were attempted, but that they should forthwith call home the yoonger sort: who hauing spéedily atchieued their desire, returned home before the Kings Councell, and the Mayor departed without more harme,  after which time (saieth Hall,) these fieldes were neuer hedged, but now wee see the thing in worse case then euer, before it was by the meanes of inclosure for gardens,Banquetin

One Alfune builded for the Inhabitants a parish Church which is of S. GilesParish church of S.

               This Alfune in the raigne of Henry the first became the first Hospitaler of S. Bartilmewes Hospital in Smithfielde, as in another place I haue noted. And this Parish church of S. Giles being at the first a smal thing stoode in place where now standeth the Uicarage house: but hath beene since at diuers times much enlarged according as the parish hath encreased, and was at the length newly builded in place where now it, standeth. But the same new church being large, stronglie builded and richly furnished with ornamentes, was in the yeare 1545. sore brent and consumed, notwithstanding it was againe within a short space of  time restored as now it sheweth.
               Some little distance from the east end of this Church, standeth a fayre Conduite castellated in Forstreete. Then had yee a Bosse of sweete water in the wall of the Church yarde now lately made a Pumpe, but already decayed.

And thus haue you all the suburbe without Criplegate being almost altogether in the parish of S. Giles which hath more then 1800. Householders, and aboue 4000. Communicantes.

This houseCharterhouse he founded vpon this occasion, a great Pestilence entring this Iland, began first in Dorset shire, then proceeded into Deuonshire, Somerset shire, Glocester shire, and Oxforde shire, and at length came to London, and ouerspread all England, so wasting the people, that scarse the tenth person of all sortes was left aliue, and Churchyards were not sufficient to receiue the dead but men were forced to chuse out certain fieldes for burials, whereupon Ralph Stratforde Bishop of London, in the yeare 1348. bought a peece of ground called no mans land,
                  No mans land which he inclosed with a wall of Bricke and dedicated for buriall of the deade, builded thereupon a proper Chappell, which is now enlarged and made a dwelling house, as this burying plot is, became a fayre Garden, retayning the olde name of Pardon Church yarde.pardon church yarde by the Charterhouse.
               
               After this in the yeare 1349. the saide Sir Walter Many in respect of danger that might befall in this time of so great a plague and infection, purchased thirteene acres and a rode of ground adioyning to the said no mans land, and lying in a place called Spittle Crost, because it belonged to S.

One Mayster Roper hath of late builded there, by meanes whereof, part of the ruines of the old Temple were séene to remaine builded of Cane stone, round informe as the new temple by Temple barre. Beyond this Southampton house is New stréete, so called in the raigne of Henry the 3. when hee founded  the house of Conuertes, betwixt the Old Temple and the new.
               The same stréet hath sithence béene called Chauncery lane,Newstreet or Chancery lane by reason that king Edward the third annexed the house of Conuerts by Pattent to the office of Custos Rotulorum, or maister of the Rolles, in the 15. of his raigne.
               In this stréete the first faire building to bee noted on the East side, is called the Coursitors office,Coursitors office in Chauncery lane. builded with diuers faire lodgings for Gentlemen, all of Bricke and timber, by Sir Nicholas Bacon late Lord Keeper of the great seale, deceased in the yeare 1578.
               Neere vnto this Coursitors Office be diuers faire houses and large gardens builded and made in a ground, sometime belonging to one great house on the other side the stréete there made by Raph Neuell Bishop of Chichester. Then was the house of Conuerts wherein now the Rolles of Chauncerie be kept. Then the Serieants Inne.
               On the West side towardes the North end thereof was of old time the church and house of the preaching Friers:Blacke Fryers Church in Oldborne. the which house I finde that in the yeare of Christ 1221. the Friers preachers 13. in number came into England, and hauing to their Prior one named Gilbert de Fraxineto, in company of Peter de la Roche Bishop of Winchester, came to Canterbury, where presenting themselues before the Archbishop Stephen, he commanded the said Prior to preach, whose sermon he liked so well, that euer after he loued that Order. These Fryers came to London, and had their first house without the wall of the Citie by Oldborne, neere vnto the old Temple.
               
                  Hubert de Burgo Earle of Kent was a great benefactor vnto these Fryers, and deceasing at his Mannor of Bansted in Surrey, or (after some writers) at his Castle of Barkamsted in Hartfordshire, in the yeare 1242. was buried in their Church, vnto the which Church he had giuen his place at Westminster, which the said FryersEarle of Kent buried in the Blacke Fryers. afterward solde to Walter Grey Archbishoppe of Yorke, & he left it to his successors in that Sea, for euer to be their house when they shoulde repaire to the Citie of London. And therefore the same was called Yorke Place, which name so continued vntill the yeare 1529. that King Henry the eight tooke  it from Thomas Wolsey Cardinall, and Archbishoppe of Yorke, and then gaue it to name White hall.
               
               
                  Margaret sister to the king of Scottes, widowe to Geffrey Earle Marshall deceased 1244. and was buried in this church.
               In the yere 1250. the Fryers of this order of preachers through Christendome and from Ierusalem, were by a ConuocationConuocation of black Fryers in Oldborne. assembled together, at this their house by Oldborne to entreat of their estate, to the number of 400. hauing meat and drinke found them of almes, because they had no possessions of their owne. The first day the king came to their Chapter, founde them meate and drinke and dined with them. An other day the Quéene founde them meat and drinke: afterward the Bishop of London, then the Abbot of Westminster, of S. Albones, Waltham, and others. In the yeare 1276. Gregory Rokesley Mayor, and the Barons of London graunted and gaue to Robert Kilwerbie Archbishop of Canterbury, two lanes, or wayes next the stréet of Baynards Castle, and the Tower of Mountfichet, to bee destroyed. On the which place the said Robert builded the late new church, with the rest of the stones that were left of the said Tower. And thus the blacke Fryers left their Church and house by Oldborne, and departed to their new. This old Fryer house (iuxta Holborne saith the Pattent) was by King Edward the first, in the 16. of his raigne giuen to Henry Lacy Earle of Lincolne.
               
               Next to this house of Fryers, was one other great house, sometime belonging to the Bishop of Chichester, whereof Mathew Paris writeth thus: Raph de Noua villa or Neuill, Bishop of Chichester,
                  Bishop of Chichesters Inne. and Chauncellor of England sometime builded a noble house, euen from the ground not farre from the newe Temple, and house of Conuertes, in the which place hee deceased in the yeare 1244. In this place after the decease of the said Bishoppe, and in place of the house of Blacke Fryers, before spoken of, Henry Lacie Earle of Lincolne,
                  Lycons Inne. Constable of Chester, and Custos of Englande, builded his Inne, and for the most parte was 
                     •
                  lodged there: hee deceased in this house in the yeare 1310. and was buried in the new worke, (whereunto he had been a great benefactor) of S. Pauls church betwixt our Ladie Chappell, and S. Dunstones Chappell. This Lincolnes 
                   Inne sometime pertaining to the Bishoppes of Chichester as a part of the said great house, is now an Inne of Court, retayning the name of Lincolnes Inne as afore, but now lately increased with faire buildings, and replenished with Gentlemen studious in the common lawes: this house was greatly increased with new buildinges.
               In the raigne of Henry the eight Sir Thomas Louell was a great builder there, especially hee builded the gate house and forefront towardes the east, placing thereon aswell the Lacies armes, as his owne: he caused the Lacies armes to bee cast and wrought in leade, on the louer of the hall of that house, which was in the 3. Escutcheons, a Lyon rampant for Lacie, 7. Masculles voyded for Quincie, and 3.Lincolns Inne an Inne of Court. Wheat sheaues for Chester. This Louer being of late repayred the saide Escutcheons were left out. The rest of that side euen to Fléetstreet is replenished with faire buildings.

This Hospital (saith the record of Edward the third the 19. yeare) was founded without the barre veteris Templi London conuersorum. Moreouer (saith the same Recorde) in the 20. of Edward the third, the saide King sent commandement vnder his great seale, to the Mayor and Sheriffes of London,
                  Hospitall of S.

                  Without the barre of the Citie, called Temple barre, and first of the Dutchy of Lancaster. on the said south side or left hande neere vnto the Riuer of Thames, amongst other buildings memorable for greatnesse, the first was Excester house, so called for that the same belonged to the Bishop of Excester, and was their Inne or London lodging: the same hath béene sithence called Paget house, because the Lord William Paget enlarged and possessed it. Then is Leycester house so named because Robert Dudley late Earle of Leycester, of late new builded there. And now Essex house,Excester house since Leycester house, now Essex house. of the late Earle of Essex there inhabiting.
               Then west was a Chappell dedicate to the Holy Ghost, called S. Spirit,
                  Chapell of S. Spirit. vpon what occasion founded I haue not read.
               Then is Milford laneMilford lane. downe to the Thames, why so called I haue not heard nor can coniecture.
               Then was the Bishop of Bathes Inne,Bishop of Bathes Inne, or Arundell house. lately new builded, for a great parte thereof by the Lorde Thomas Seamer Admirall, which came sithence to be possessed by the Earle of Arondell, and thereof called Arundell house.
               Next beyond the which on the stréet side, was sometime a faire Cemitorie (or Churchyard) and in the same a parish Church,Parish church of S. Mary at the strand. called of the natiuitie of our Ladie, and the innocents at the Strand, and of some, by meane of a brotherhood kept there, called of S. Vrsula at the Strand.
               
                   And neere adioyning to the said church, betwixt it and the riuer of Thames, was an Inne of Chauncery, commonly called Chosters InneChesters Inne or Strand Inne an Inne of Chauncery. (because it belonged to the Bishoppe of Chester) by others named of the situation Strand Inne.
               Then had yee in the high stréete a faire bridge called Strande bridge,Strand bridge. and vnder it a lane or way downe to the landing place on the banke of the Thames.
               Then was the Bishoppe of Chesters Inne,The Bishop of Chesters Inne. or his London lodging. And next adioyning to it the Bishoppe of Worcesters Inne:The Bishop of Worcesters Inne. all which to wit, the parrish of Saint Mary at Strande, Strand Inne, Strand bridge, with the lane vnder it, the Bishop of Chesters Inne, the Bishoppe of Worcesters Inne, with all the tenementes adioyning were by commandement of Edwarde Duke of Sommerset vncle to Edward the sixt, and Lord Protector, pulled downe, and made leuell ground, in the yeare 1549. In this place whereof he builded that large and goodly house, now called Somerset house.Sommerset house.
               
               In the high stréete néere vnto the Strande sometime stoode a crosse of stone against the Bishoppe of Couentrie or Chester his house, whereof I reade, that in the yeare 1294. and diuers other times, the Iustices Itinerantes, sate without London, at the stone crosse ouer against the Bishop of Couentries house, and sometime they sate in the Bishops house, which was hard by the Strand.Stone crosse at Strand.
               
               Then next is the Sauoy so called of Peter Earle of Sauoy, and Richmond,
                  Sauoy house first builded by Peter Earle of Sauoy & Richmond. sonne to Thomas Earle of Sauoy, brother to Boniface Archbishop of Canterbury, and vncle vnto Helenor wife to king Henry the third.
               He first builded this house in the yeare 1245. and here is some occasion offered to proue that this Peter of Sauoy was also Earle of Sauoy. Wherefore out of a booke of the Genealogies of all the whole house of Sauoy, compiled by Phillebert Pingonio, Baron of Guzani, remaining in the hands of W.

                   knightes, and Anthony Kingston, and Richarde Crumwell Esquiers, at which came into the Lists that dayrichly apparelled and their horses trapped all in white Ueluet, there came against them the saide day 46.

Defendantes: Sir Iohn Dudley, and the Earle of Surrey running first, which at the first course lost their Gauntletes: and that day Sir Richarde Cromwell ouerthrew maister Palmer and his horse in the fielde to the great honor of the chalengers, the

               Next beyond this Durham house is one other great house somtime belonging to the Bishop of Norwitch,The Bishop of Norwitch his house. and was his London lodging, which now pertayneth to the Archbishop of Yorke by this occasion. In the yeare 1529. when Cardinall VVolsey Archbishop of Yorke was indighted in the Premunirey, whereby  king Henry the eight was intituled to his goodes and possessions: hée also seazed into his hands, the saide Archbishoppes house, commonly called Yorke place, and changed the name thereof into White hall whereby the Archbishops of Yorke being dispossessed and hauing no house of repayre about London, Quéene Marie gaue vnto Nicholas Heth then Archbishoppe of Yorke and to his successors, Suffolke house in Southwarke, lately builded by Charles Bramdon Duke of Suffolke, as I haue shewed.
               This house the saide Archbishops solde, and bought the aforesaide house of olde time belonging to the Bishoppes of Norwich, which of this last purchase is now called Yorke house, the Lord Chancellors, or Lorde Keepers of the great Seale of England, haue beene lately there lodged.
               Then was there an Hospitall of S. Marie Rounceual

               Neare vnto this Hospitall was an Hermitage, with a Chappell of S. Katherine

               This Hospitall was surrendred to Henry the eight the thrée and twentith of his raigne, and the Sisters being compounded with all were allowed Pensions for terme of their liues, and the king builded there a goodly Mannor, annexing thereunto a Parke,S. Iames Parke closed about with a wall, of bricke now called S. Iames Parke seruing indifferently to the saide Mannor, and to the Mannor or Pallace of White hall.
               South from Chating Crosse on the right hand, are diuers fayre houses lately builded before the Parke, then a large Tyltyarde for Noble men,Tylt yarde at Westminster. and other to exercise themselues in Iusting, Turning, and Feighting at the Barryars.

               From this way vp to the Woolestable and to the high Tower, or gate which entreth the Pallace Court, all is replenished with buildinges, and inhabitantes.
               Touching this Woolestable,T. Glifforde. I reade that in the raign of Edwarde the first, the Staple being at Westminster the parrishioners of S. Margaret, and Marchantes of the Staple builded of new the saide Church, the great Chancell excepted, which was lately before new builded, by the Abbote of Westminster.
               Moreouer that in the 27. of Edwarde the thirde the Staple of Woole, before kept at Bruges in Flanders, was ordayned by Parliament to bee kept in diuers places of England, Wales, & Ireland, as at Newcastle, Yorke, Lincolne, Canterbury, Norwitch, Westminster, Chichester, Winchester, Excester, Bristow, and Carmarden, &c. to the greate benefit of the king, and losse vnto strangers, and marchantes. For there grew vnto the king by this meanes (as it was saide) the summe of one thousand a hundred and two pounds by the yere more then any his predicessors before had receiued, the Staple at Westminster at that time began on the next morrow after the feast of S. Peter Ad vincula. The next yeare there was granted to the king by Parliament towardes the recouery of his title in France, fifty shillinges of euery sacke of Wooll transported ouer seas, for the space of six yeares next ensuing,Robert de A. nesbery. by meanes whereof the king might dispend dayly during those yeares, more then a thousande markes starling. For by the common opinion there were more then 100000. sackes of Wool yearely transported into forrain landes, so that during six yeares the saide grant extended to fiftéene hundred thousand pound starling.
               In the 37. of Edwarde the thirde it was granted vnto him for  two yeares to take six and twenty shillinges eight pence, vppon euery sacke of Woolle transported and the same yeare the Staple of Woole (notwithstanding the kings oth and other great estates) was ordayned to bée kept at Callis and six and twenty marchants the best and welthiest of all England, to be Farmers there, both of the Towne and Staple for three yeares, euery marchant to haue six men of Armes, and foure Archers at the kinges rost. Hée ordayned there also two Maiors, one for the towne, and one for the Staple, and hée tooke for mala capta commonlie called Maltorth (I thinke Custome) twentie shillinges, and of the said marchantes Gardians of the Towne forty pence, vppon euery sacke of Woolle.
               In the 44. of Edwarde the thirde, Quamborough Kingston vpon Hull, and Boston, were made Staples of Wooll, which matter so much offended some, that in the 50. of his raigne in a Parliament at London, it was complayned that the Staple of Woole, was so remoued from Callis to diuers townes in England contrary to the statute, appointing that Citizens and marchantes should kéepe it there, and that the king might haue the profites and customes with the exchange of golde and siluer that was there made, by all the Marchantes in Christendome (estemed to amount to 8000

                  . by yeare) the Exchange onely: and the Citizens and marchantes so ordred the matter that the king spent nothing vpon souldiers neither vpon defence of the town against the ennemies, whereas now hee spent eight thousande pound by yeare.
               In the yeare 1388. the twelfth of Richarde the second,Manu script. French. in a Parliament at Cambridge, it was ordayned that the staple of WoolesWooll Staple at Middle. b

               And now to passe to the famous Monasterie of Westminster: At the very entrance of the Close thereof is a lane that leadeth toward the West
                     •
                   called Théeuing lane,Theeuing lane. for that theeues were led that way to the Gate house, while the Sanctuarie continued in force.
               This Monasterie was founded and builded by Sebert king of the East Saxons, vpon the perswasion of Ethelbert king of Kent, who hauing imbraced christianitie, and being baptized by Melitus Bishop of London: immediatly (to shew himselfe a christian indéede) built a church to the honor of God and Saint Peter, on the West side of the cittie of London, in a place (which because it was ouergrowen with thornes, and enuironed with water) the Saxons called Thorney, and now of the Monastery and West situation thereof is called Westminster.
                  Foundation of Westminster by Sebert a Christian king not only in word but in deed.
               
               In this place (saith Fulcardus
                  Fulcardus.) long before was a Temple of Apollo, which being ouerthrowne, King Lucius built therein a Church of Christianitie.
               
                  Sebert was buried in this church, with his wife Athelgoda, whose bodies many yeares after, to wit in the raigne of Richard the second (saith Walsingham
                  Walsingham.) were translated from the old church to the new, and there interred.
               Edgare King of the West Saxons repaired this Monasterie about the yeare of Christ 
                     •
                  958. Edward the Confessor builded it of new, wherevpon T. Clifford writeth thus.
               Without the walles of London (saith he) vppon the Riuer of Thames there was in times passed a little Monasterie,T. Clifford. builded to the honor of God, and Saint Peter, with a few Benedict Monkes in it, vnder an Abbotte seruing Christ: very poore they were, and little was giuen them for their reliefe, here the king intended (for that it was néere to the famous citie of London and the Riuer of Thames, that brought in all kind of Marchandizes from all partes of the worlde) to make his Sepulcher,  be commanded therefore that of the tenthes of all his rentes, the worke should be begunne in such sort as should become the Prince of the Apo

                  tles.
               At this his commandement the work is nobly begun, euen from the foundation and happely procéedeth till the same was finished: the charges bestowed, or to be bestowed are not regarded. He graunted to this church great priuiledges, aboue all the churches in this land as partly appeare by this his Charter.

               He also caused y• parish Church of S. Margaret
                  Parish church of S. Margaret to be newly builded, without the Abbie church of Westminster for the ease & commoditie of the Monks, because before that time the parish Church stoode within the old Abbey church in the South Isle, some what to their annoyance. This church of S. Margaret (which that king Edward builded) continued till the daies of King Edwarde the first, at what time the staple of woolles was at Westminster, and then the parishioners and Merchantes of the Staple builded it all of new (the great chancell excepted, which was done by the Abbots of Westminster as is afore shewed.
               King Henry the third in the yeare of Christ 1220. began the new worke of our Ladies Chappell, and in the yeare 1245. the walles and stéeple of the olde Church (builded by king Edwarde)  were taken downe, and inlarging the same Church, caused them to be made more comely, for the furtherance whereof in the yeare 1246. the same king (deuising how to extort money from the citizens of London towardes the charges) appointed a Mart to be kept at Westminster,
                  A Mart at Westminster. the same to last fiftéene dayes, and in the meane space all trade of Merchandise to cease in the Cittie, which thing the citizens were faine to redéeme with two thousand pound of siluer.
               The worke of this Church with the houses of Office, was finished to the end of the Quire in the yeare 1285. the 14. of Edward the first. All which labour of 66. yeares, was in the yeare 1299. defaced by a fire kindled in the lesser Hall of the Kinges Pallace at Westminster,
                  Westminster with the pallace burned. the same with many other houses adioyning, and with the Quéenes chamber were all consumed, the flame thereof also (being driuen with the wind) fired the Monasterie, which was also with the pallace consumed.
               Then was this Monastery againe repaired by the Abbotes of that Church, king Edward the first and his successors putting to their helping handes.
               
                  Edward the second apropriated vnto this Church the patronages of the Churches of Kelueden and Sabritsworth in Essex in the Diocesse of London.

               Edward by the grace of God, King of Englishmen: I make it to be knowne to all generations of the world after me, that by speciall commandement of our holy Father Pope Leo, I haue renewed & honored the holy church of the blessed Apostle S. Peter of Westminster, & I order and establish for euer, that what person of what condition or estate soeuer he be, from whence soeuer hee come, or for what offence or cause it be, eyther for his refuge into the said holy place, he be assured of his life, liberty and limmes: And ouer this I forbid vnder the paine of euerlasting damnation, that no minister of mine, or of my successors intermeddle them with any the goods, landes or possessions of the said persons taking the said Sanctuary: for I haue taken their goodes and liuelod into my speciall protection, and therefore I graunt to euery each of them in as much as my terrestriall power may suffice, all manner freedome of ioyous libertie: And whosoeuerpresumes or doth contrary to this my graunt, I will he lose his name, worshippe, dignitie, and power, and that with the great traytor Iudas that betrayed our Sauiour, he be in the euerlasting fier of hell, and I will and ordaine that this my graunt endure as long as there remayneth in England, eyther loue or dread of christian name.
               More of this Sactuarie ye may read in our histories, and also in the statute of Henry the eight, the 32. yeare.
               
                   Next to this famous Monastery, is the Kings principall Pallace, of what antiquitie it is vncertaine: but Edward the Confessor held his Court there: as may appeare by the testimony of sundrie, and namely of Ingulphus, as I haue before told you. The said king had his Pallace, and for the most part remained there: where he also ended his life, and was buried in the Monastery which he had builded. It is not to be doubted, but that King William the first, as he was crowned there, so he builded much at this Pallace: for he found it farre inferiour to the building of princely pallaces in France. And it is manifest, by the testimony of many Authors, that William Rufus builded the great Hall there, about the yeare of Christ, 1097 amongst others, Roger of Windouar, and Mathewe Parris,
                  Great hall at Westminster. Mathew Paris. doo write, that King William (being returned out of Normandie into England) kept his feast of Whitsontide very royally at Westminster, in the new Hall which he had lately builded, the length whereof (say some) was 270. foote, and seuentie foure foote in breadth, and when he heard men say, that this Hall was too great, he answered,Liber Woodbridge. and said: this Hall is not bigge inough, by the one halfe, and is but a Beade chamber in comparison of that I meane to make: a diligent searcher (saith Paris) might finde out the foundation of the hall, which he had supposed to haue builded, stretching from the Riuer of Thames, euen to the common high way. This Pallace was repaired about the yeare,Pallace repaired. 1163. by Thomas Becket,
                  W. Fitzstephēs Chauncelor of England, with excéeding great celeritie and spéede: which before, was ready to haue fallen downe. This hath béene the principall seate and Pallace of all the Kings of England, since the Conquest: for héere haue they in the great Hall kept their feasts of Coronation especially, and other solemne feasts, as at Christmas, and such like, most commonly: for proofe whereof, I finde Recorded, that in the yeare, 1236. and the twentieth of Henry the third, on the 29. of December,Record Tower. 
                  William de Hauarhull the Kings Treasurer, is commaunded, that vpon the day of Circumcision of our Lord, hee caused 6000. poore people to be fed at Westminster, for the state of the King, the Quéene, and their children: the weake and aged to be placed in the great Hall:The vse of great Halles was to feede the Poore. and in the lesser, those that were most strong, and in reasonable plight: in the Kings Chamber, the children in the Quéenes: and when the King knoweth the charge, he would allow  it in the accounts. The like commaundement, the said King Henry gaue to Hugh Gifford and William Browne, that vpon Fryday next after the Epiphany, they should cause to be fed in the great Hal of Windfor, at a good fire, all the poore and néedy children that could be found, and the kings children, being waighed and measured, their waight and measure to be distributed for their good estates.
               In the yeare 1238. the same King Henry kept his feast of Christmas at Westminster,
                  Mathew Paris. in the great Hall: so did he in the yeare 1241. where he placed the Legate in the most honourable place of the Table, to wit, in the middest, which the Noble men tooke in euill part: the King sate on the right hand, and the Archbishop on the left, and then all the Prelates and Nobles according to their estates: for the King himselfe set the Guests. The yeare 1242. he likewise kept his Christmas in the Hall, &c. Also in the yeare 1243. Richard Earle of Cornwell the Kings brother, married Cincia, daughter to Beatrice, Countesse of Prouince, and kept his marriage feast in the great Hall at Westminster, with great royalty and company of Noble men: insomuch, that there were tolde (triginta milia) 30000. dishes of meates at that dinner.
               In the yeare 1256. King Henry sate in the ExchequerH. the 3. sate in the Exchequer and merced the Sheriffes. of this Hall, and there sette downe order for the appearance of Sheriffes, and bringing in of their accounts: there was fiue Markes set on euery Sheriffes head for a fine, because they had not distrained euery person, that might dispend fiftéene pound land by the yeare to receiue the order of Knighthoode, as the same Sheriffes were commanded.
               In the yeares 1268 and 1269. the same king kept his Christmas feasts at Westminster as before, and also in the same, 1269. he translated with great solemnitie, the body of king E. the Confessor,Translation of E. the Confessor. into a new Chapell, at the backe of the high Alter: which Chapell hee had prepaired of a meruailous workmanship, bestowing a new Tombe or Shrine of Golde, and on the day of his translation, hee kept a royall feast in the great Hall of the Pallace: thus much for the feast of olde time in this Hall.
               We read also, that in the yeare 1236. the riuer of thames ouerflowing the Banques, caused the Marshes about Woolwitch to bee all on a Sea,Marshes about Woolwitch drowned. wherein Boates and other vesselles were carried  with the streame, so that besides cattell, the greatest number of men women, and children, inhabitants there, were drowned: and in the great Pallace of Westminster, men did rowe with wheries,Wheries rowed in Westminster Hall. in the middest of the hall, being forced to ride to their chambers.
               Moreouer, in the yeare 1242. the Thames ouerflowing the banques about Lambhithe, drowned houses and fields, by the space of sixe miles, so that in the great hall at Westminster, men tooke their horsse, because the water ran ouer all. This Pallace was (in the yeare, 1299. the twentie seuenth of Edward the first, brent by a vehement fire,T. Walsinghā. Pallace at Westminster brent. kindled in the lesser hall of the Kings house, the same with many other houses adioyning, and with the Quéenes chamber, were consumed, but after that repaired. In the yeare, 1313. the 31. of E. the first, the kings treasury at Westminster was robbed,The kings Treasury at Westminster robbed. for y• which, Walter Abbot of Westminster,

In the yeare 1316 E. the 2. did solemnize his feast of Penticost, at Westminster, in the great Hall,E. the 2. keeping his feasts at Westm. hal. was presented with a complaint, of not rewarding souldiers. where sitting royally at the table, with his Peares about him, there entred a woman adorned like a Minstrell, sitting on a great horse, trapped as Minstrelles then vsed, who rode round about the tables, shewing pastime, and at length, came vp to the kings table, and laide before him a letter, and forthwith turning her horse, saluted euery one, and departed. The letters being opened, had these contents. Our Soueraigne Lord the King, hath nothing courteously respected his knights, that in his fathers time, and also in his owne, haue put forth their persons to diuers perils, and haue vtterly lost, or greatly diminished their substance, for honor of the said King, and he hath inriched aboundantly such as haue not borne the waight as yet, of the businesse, &c.

                   This hall being finished in the yeare, 1399. the same King kept a most royall Christmas there, with dayly Iustings and runnings at Tylt, whereunto resorted such a number of people, that there was euery day spent, twentie eight, or twentie sixe Oxen, and thrée hundreth Shéepe, besides fowle, without number: hee caused a gowne for himselfe to be made of Golde, garnished with Pearle and precious Stone, to the value of 3000. Markes: he was garded by Cheshiere men, and had about him commonly thirtéene Bishops, besides Barons, Knights, Esquires, and other more then néeded: insomuch, that to the houshold, came euery day to meate 10000. people, as appeared by the messes tolde out from the Kitchen to 300. Seruitors.
               Thus was this great Hall for the honour of the Prince oftentimes furnished with guests,Ro. Iuelefe. not onely in this kings time (a prodigall Prince) but in the time or other also, both before & since, though not so vsually noted. For when it is said, the King held his Feast of Christmas, or such a Feast at Westminster, it may well bee supposed to bee kept in this great Hall, as most sufficient to such a purpose.
               I finde noted by Robert Fabian,
                  Ro. Fabian. the Chronickler (sometime a Citizen and an Alderman of London) that king Henry the seuenth,King Henry the 7. feasted the Mayor of London, &c. in the ninth of his raigne (holding his royall feast of Christmas, at Westminster) on the twelfth day, feasted Raphe Austry, then Mayor of London, and his brethren the Aldermen, with other Commoners in great number, and after dinner, dubbing the Mayor Knight, caused him with his brethren, to stay and behold the disguizings and other disports, in the night following, shewed in the great Hall, which was richly hanged with Arras, and Staged about on both sides: which disports being ended in the morning, the King, the Quéene, the Ambassadors, and other states, being set at a table of stone, 60. knights, and Esquires, serued 60. dishes to the Kings Messe, and as many to the Quéenes (neither flesh nor fish) and serued the Mayor with twentie foure dishes to his Messe, of the same manner, with sundrie wynes, in most plentious wise: and finally, the King and Quéene, beeing conueyed with great lights into the Pallace, the Mayor with his Company in Barges, returned and came to London, by breake of the next day. Thus much for building  of this great hall, and feasting therein. It moreouer appeareth, that many Parliaments haue beene kept there:
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   for I finde noted, that in the yeare 1397. the great Hall at Westminster, beeing out of reparations, and therefore (as it were newe builded by Richard the second, (as is before shewed) the same Richard in the meane time hauing occasion to holde a Parliament, caused for that purpose a large house to be builded in the middest of the Pallace Court, betwixt the clocke Tower, and the gate of the olde great Hall, this house was very large and long, made of timber, couered with Tyle, open on both the sides, and at both the endes, that all men might see and heare what was both sayde and done.
               The Kings archers (in number, 4000. Chesh
                        •
                     ire men) compassed the house about with their Bowes bent, and Arrowes nocked in their hands, alwayes ready to shoote: they had bouch of courtBouch of Court. (to wit, meat and drinke) and great wages, of sixe pence by the day.
               The olde great Hall being new builded, Parliaments were againe there kept as before: namely, one in the yeare 1399. for the deposing of Richard the second. A great part of this Pallace at Westminster was once againe brent in the yeare 1512. the fourth of Henry the eight, since the which time, it hath not béene reedified: onely the great Hall, with the offices neare adioyning, are kept in good reparations, and serueth as afore it did, for feasts at Coronations, Arraignments of great persons charged with treasons, kéeping of the courts of iustice, &c. But the Princes haue béene lodged in other places about the citie, as at Baynards Castle, at Bridewell, and White Hall, sometime called Yorke Place, and sometimes at S. Iames.
               
               This great Hall hath béene the vsuall place of pleadings, and ministration of Iustice, whereof somewhat shortly I will note. In times past, the courts and benches followed the King, wheresoeuer he went, as well since the conquest, as before, which thing at length being thought combersome, painfull, and chargeable to the people, it was in the yeare 1224. the 9. of H. the 3. agreed, that there should be a standing place appointed, where matters should be heard and iudged, which was in the great Hall at Westminster.

               Within the Port, or entry into the Hall, on either side, are ascendings vp into large chambers: without the Hall adioyning thereunto, wherein certaine Courts be kept, namely, on the right hand, is the court of the Exchequer,Court of the Exchequer. a place of account, for the reuenewes of the crowne: the hearers of the account, haue Auditors vnder them, but they which are the chéefe for the accounts of the prince, are called Barons of the Exchequer, wherof one is called the chéefe Baron.

This Court of the Exchequer, hath of olde time (and as I thinke, since the conquest) béene kept at Westminster, notwithstanding, sometimes remooued thence by commaundement of the king, for a time, and after restored againe, as namely, in the yeare, 1209.

Hee builded for those, from the house of receit, along nigh to the Thames, within the same Pallace, there to inhabite, and since that, there was also builded for them, betwixt the the clocke house, and the wooll staple, called the wey-house. Hee also builded to the vse of this chapell, (though out of the Pallace court) some distance West, in the little Sanctuarie,Litle Sanctuarie. a strong Clotchard of stone and timber, couered with Leade, and placed therein, thrée belles, about the biggest of the which (as I haue béene informed) was written.

But to my matter of our London Bishops, as I finde it written: First, there remaineth in the Parish church of Saint Peter vppon Cornhill in Londō, a Table, wherein is written, that Lucius founded the same church to be an Archbishops See, and Metrapolitane, or chiefe church of his Kingdome, and that it so indured the space of foure hundred yeares, vntill the comming in of Augustine the Moonke, and others, from Rome, in the raigne of the Saxons.
               The Archbishops names, I finde onely to be set downe by Ioceline of Furdes,
                  Socelin of Furnes. in his book of Brittish Bishops, and not elsewhere.
               
                  1. Thean (saith hee) was the first Archbishop of London in the time of Lucius, who builded the said church of S. Peter, in a place called Cornhill in London, by the ayde of Ciran, chiefe butler to the king Lucius.
                  
                  2. Eluanus was the second, and hee builded a Library to the same Church adioyning, and conuerted many of the Dreudes (learned men in the Paganne lawe) to the Christian faith.
                  3. Cadar was the third: then followed,

                  he writeth not himselfe Archbishop, and therefore maketh the matter of Archbishops doubtfull, or rather ouerthroweth that opinion.
               The Saxons being Pagons, hauing chased the Brittons, with the Christian Preachers, into the Mountaines of Wales and Cornewall: and hauing deuided this Kingdome of the Brittons amongst themselues, at the length (to wit, in the yeare 596.) Pope Gregorie moued of a godly instinction (sayeth Bede) in the 147. yeare, after the arriual of the Angles (or Saxons) in Britaine, sent Augustine, Miletus, Iustus, and Iohn, with other Moonks, to preach of Gospel, to the said Nation of the Angles in Britaine: these landed in the Ile of Thanet, and were first receiued by Ethelbert, King of Kent, whom they conuerted to the Faith of Christ, with diuers other of his people in the 34. yeare of his Raigne: which Ethelbert gaue vnto Augustine, the Citie of Canterburie.
               
               This Augustine in the yeare of Christ, 604. consecrated Melitus, and Iustus Bishops, appointing Melitus to preach vnto the East Saxons, whose chiefe Citie was London: and there King Sebert Nephewe to Ethelbert by preaching of Melitus, receiued the word of life: the then Ethelbert (King of Kent) builded in the Citie of London, Saint Pauls,
                  Saint Pauls Church in London first founded. Church wherein Melitus began to bee Bishop, in the yeare, 619.1. Melitus first Bishop of London, 619. and sate fiue yeares. Ethelbert by his Charter, gaue lands to this Church of Saint Paule: so did other kings after him: King Sebert through the good life and like preaching of Melitus, hauing receiued Baptisme, To shew himself a Christian, builded a Church, to the honour of God and S. Peter, on the West side of London, which Church is called Westminster, but the Successors of Sebert (beeing Pagannes) expelled Melitus.

               Thus much for the chiefe and principall Gouernors of this famous Citie, of whose politike gouernment, with the assistance of inferior officers, their charges for kéeping of the peace, seruice of the Prince, and honour of this Citie, much might haue beene said, and I had thought to haue touched, but being informed that a learned Gentleman, a Citizen borne, minded such a labor, and promised to performe it, I haue forborne, and left the same to his good leysure.
               
                  NOw since that I haue giuen you an outward view of this City, it shall not be impertinent to let you take an insight also of the same, such as a Londoner borne, discoursed aboue twenty yeares agone, for answere (as it seemeth) to some obiections, that then were made against the growing greatnes thereof. The Author gaue it me, & therefore howsoeuer I conceale his name (which it selfe pretendeth not) I thinke it may without his offence impart it to others, that they may take pleasure in the reading, as I doubt not but he did in the writing. Long may they (that list) enuie, and long may we and our posterity enioy the good estate of this Citie.
            
            
               
               A Discourse of the names and first causes of the institution of Cities, and peopled townes. And of the commodities that doe growe by the same: and namely of the Citie of London. Written by way of an Apologie (or defence) against the opinion of some men, which thinke that the greatnesse of that Citie standeth not with the profit and securitie of this Realme.
               CIties and well peopled places bee called Oppida, in Latine, eyther ab ope danda, or ab opibus, or ab opponendo se hostibus. They be named also ciuitates a coeundo, and (vrbes) either of the word vrbare, because the first inclosure of them was described with ye draught of a Plow. Or els ab orbe, for the round compasse that they at the first had.
               In the Gréeke a Cittie is tearmed
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , eyther of the worde

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , multus, or of
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : id est, habitare, alere, gubernare.
               
               In the Saxon (or old English) sometimes Tun, which wee now call Towne, deriued of the word Tynan, to inclose or tyne, as some yet speake. But for as much as that word was proper to euery village and inclosed dwelling, therefore our auncestors called their walled townes,
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  or
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and we now Bury and Borow, of the Gréeke word
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  (as I thinke) which signifieth a Tower or a high building.
               The walles of these townes had their name of vallum, because at the first they were but of that earth which was cast out of the trench or ditch wherewith they were enuironed.
               But afterward, being made of matter more fit for defence, they were named a muniendo maenia. By the Etimologie of  these names, it may appeare that common weales, Cities and townes were at the first inuented, to the end that men might leade a ciuile life amongst themselues, and bee saued harmeles against their enemies: whereupon Plato saith, Ciuitates ab initio vtilitatis causa constitutae sunt. Aristotle 1. Politicorum 2. saith, Ciuitas a natura profecta est: homo enim animal aptum est ad coetus, & proinde ciuitatis origo ad viuendum, institutio ad bene viuendum refertur. And Cicero, (lib. primo de inuentione) in the beginning saith, Fuit quoddam tempus cum in agris homines passim bestiarum more vagabantur, &c. quo quidem tempore, quidā (magnus viz. vir, & sapiens) dispersos homines in agris, & tectis siluestribus abditos, ratione quadam compulit in vnum locum, at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      eos in vnam quam
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      rem induxit vtilem & honestam. Vrbibus verò constitutis, fidem colere, & institiam retinere discebant, & alijs parere sua voluntate consuescebant, &c. The same man discourseth notablie to the same effect, in his Oration pro Sestio, a little after the middest thereof, shewing that in the life of men dispersed vis beareth all the sway: but in the Ciuile life and societie ius is better maintained, &c. This thing well saw King William the Conqueror, who in his lawes (fol.125.) saith Burgi et Ciuitates fundata
& edificata sunt, ad tuitionē gentium, & populorum Regni, & idcirco obseruari debent cum omni libertate, integritate, & ratione. And his predecessors, king Ethelstane, and King Canutus in their lawes (fol. 62. & 106.) had commanded thus: Oppida instaurantur &c.
               
               Séeing therefore that as Cicero 2. officior. saith, proxime
& secuudum Deos, homines hominibus maximè vtiles esse possunt. And that men are congregated into Cities and common wealthes, for honesty and vtilities sake, these shortly be the commodities that do come by cities, communalties, and corporations. First, men (by this nearenesse of conuersation) are wtdrawen from barbarous feritie and force, to a certaine mildnes of manners, and to humanitie and iustice: whereby they are contented to giue and take right, to and from their equalles and inferiors, and to heare and obey their heades and superiors. Also the doctrine of God  is more fitly deliuered, and the discipline thereof more aptly to bee executed, in peopled Townes then abroad, by reason of the facilitie of common and often assembling. And consequently, such inhabitantes be better managed in order, and better instructed in wisedome: whereof it came to passe that at the first, they that excelled others this way, were called astuti of the Gréeke worde (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) which signifieth a Citie, although the tearme be now declined to the worst part (and do betoken euill) euen as Tyrannus, Sophista, and some such other originally good wordes are fallen: And hereof also good behauiour is yet called Vrbanitas, because it is rather found in Cities, then elswhere. In summe, by often hearing men be better perswaded in religion, and for that they liue in the eye of others, they bee by example the more easily trayned to iustice, and by shamefastnesse restrained from iniurie.
               And whereas common wealthes and kingdomes cannot haue (next after God) any surer foundation, then the loue and good wil of one man towardes an other, that also is closely bred and maintained in Cities, where men by mutuall societie and companying together, do grow to alliances, communalties and corporations.
               The liberall sciences and learninges of all sortes, which be lumina reipublicae, do flourish only in peopled townes, without the which a realme is in no better case then a man that lacketh both his eyes.
               
                  Manual artes, or handie craftes, as they haue for the most part béene inuented in townes and Cities, so they cannot any where els be eyther maintained or amended. The like is to bee saide of Marchandize, vnder which name I comprehende all manner of buying, selling, bartering, exchaunging, communicating of thinges that men néede, to and fro. Wealth and riches (which are truely called Subsidia belli, & ornamenta pacis) are increased chiefly in Townes and Cities, both to the prince & people.
               The necessitie of the poore and needie is in such places both sooner to be espied, and hath meanes to be more charitably relieued.
               The places themselues be surer refuges in all extremities of forraine inuasion, and the inhabitantes bee a ready hand and strength of men with munition to oppresse intestine sedition.
               Moreouer, for as much as the force of the warres of our  time consisteth chiefly in sho
                     •
                  te (all other soldiers being eyther horsemen or footemen armed on lande, or Mariners at the Sea). It séemeth to me that Citizens and Townesmen bee as fitte to be imployed in any of these seruices (that on horsebacke onely excepted as the inhabitantes that be drawen out of the Countrie.
               Furthermore, euen as these societies and assemblies of men in Cities and great Townes, are a continuall brydle against tiranny, which was the cause that Tarquin, Nero, Dionisius, and such others haue alwayes sought to weaken them. So (being well tempered) they are a strong forte and bulwarke not onely in the Aristocratie, but also in the lawfull kingdome, or iust royaltie.
               At once the propagation of religion, the execution of good policie, the exercise of charitie, and the defence of the countrie, is best performed by Townes and Cities: and this ciuile life approcheth nearest to the shape of that misticall bodie wherof Christ is the heade, and men bee the members: whereupon both at the first, that man of God Moyses, in the common wealth of the Israelites, and the gouernors of all Countries in all ages sithence haue continually maintayned the same. And to chaunge it were nothing els but to Metamorphose the worlde, and to make wild beastes of reasonable men. To stand longer vpon this it were in re non dubia, vti oratione non necessaria: and therefore I will come to London.
               
            
            
               The singularities of the City of London.
               WHatsoeuer is saide of Citties generally, maketh also for London specially: howbeit these thinges are particularly for our purpose to bee considered in it. The situation: the former estimation that it hath had: the seruice that it hath done: the present estate and gouernment of it, and such benefites as doe growe to the realme by the maintenance thereof.
               
                   This Realme hath onely thrée principall Riuers, whereon a royall Cittie may well be situated: Trent in the North, Seuerne, in the Southwest and Thames in the South East: of the which Thames both for the streight course in length reacheth furthest into the bellie of the lande, and for the breadth and stilnesse of the water is most nauigable vp and downe the streame: by reason whereof London (standing almost in the middle of that course) is more commodiously serued with prouision of necessaries, then any towne standing vpon any of the other two riuers can be, and both also more easily communicate to the rest of the realme the commodities of her owne intercourse and trafficke. This Riuer openeth indifferently vpon Fraunce and Flaunders, our mightiest neighbors, to whose doings we ought to haue a bent eye, and speciall regarde: and this Citie standeth thereon in such conuenient distance from the sea, as it is not onely neare inough for intelligence of the a
                     ••
                  ayres of those princes, and for the resistance of their attempts: but also sufficiently remoued from the feare of any suddaine daungers that may bee offered by them: whereas for the Prince of this realme to dwell vpon Trent, were to turne his backe, or blind side to his most daungerous borderers: and for him to rest and dwell vppon Seuerne, were to be shut 
                     •
                  ppe in a cumbersome corner: which openeth but vpon Ireland onely, a place of much lesse importance. Neither coulde London bée pitched so commodiously vppon any other parte of the same Riuer of Thames, as where it now standeth. For if it were remoued more to the west, it should lose the benefit of the ebbing and flowing: and if it were seated more towarde the East, it shoulde bee nearer to daunger of the enemie, and further both from the good ayre, and from doing good to the inner parts of the Realme: Neyther may I omit that none other place is so plentifully watered with springs, as London is.
               And whereas (amongst other thinges) Corne and Cattell, Hay and fuell bee of great necessitie: of the which Cattell may bée driuen from a farre, and corne may easily bee transported. But Hay and Fuell (being of greater bulke and burthen) must be had at hande: onely London (by the benefite of this situation  and riuer) may be sufficiently serued therewith. In which respect an Alderman of London reasonably (as me thought) affirmed, that although London receyued great nourishment by the residence of the Prince, the repaire of the parliament, and Courtes of iustice, yet it stood principally by the aduantage of the situation vpon the riuer: for when as on a time it was told him by a Courtier, that Quéene Mary (in her displeasure against London) had appointed to romoue with the Parliament and terme to Oxford, this plaine man demanded, whether she meant also to diuert the Riuer of Thames from London, or no? and when the Gentleman had answered no, then quoth the Alderman, by Gods grace we shall doe well enough at London, whatsoeuer become of the Tearme and Parliament. I my selfe being then a young scholler at Oxford did see great preparation made towardes that Tearme and Parliament, and do well remember that the common opinion and voice was, that they were not holden there, because prouision of Hay could not be made in all the Countrey to serue for tenne whole dayes together, and yet is that quarter plentifully stored with Hay for the proportion of the shire it selfe.
               For proofe of the auncient estimation of London, I will not vse the authoritie of the British historie, nor of such as follow it, (although some holde it credible enough that London was first Trinobantum ciuitas, or Troia noua, that famous Cittie in our histories, and then Ludstoune, and by corruption London, as they report) because they bee not of sufficient force to drawe the gaynesayers. Neyther will I stande much vppon that honorable testimony which Geruas. Tiberiens. giueth to London in his booke de otijs Imperialibus, saying thus, concerning the blessing of God towardes it.
               
                  In vibe London, exceptione habet diuulgatum id per omnes aequè gentes Lucani prouerbium.

               But I will rather vse the credite of one or two auncient forren  writers, and then descend to latter histories, Cornel. Tacitus lib. 4. Annal sayeth, Londinum copia negociatorum, et comeatu maxime celebris, and Herodian in the life of Seuerus the Emperour sayeth, Londinum vrbs magna et opulenta, Beda lib. Ecclesrastic. 10. Cha. 29. sheweth that Pope Gregorie appointed two Archbishops Seas in England, the one at London, the other at Yorke, king Ethelstane in his lawes appointing how many Mint maisters should bee in each Citie, allotteth eight to London, and not so many to any other cittie. The Penner of those lawes that are saide to bée made by Edwarde the Confessor and confirmed by William the Conqueror sayeth, London est caput Regni, et Legum, king Henrie the first, in the third chapter of his lawes commandeth that no Citizen of London shoulde be amerced aboue 100. 
                     •
                  . for anie pecuniarie pain. The great Charter of England (that Helena,) for which there was so long and so great warre, and contention, in the 9. Chapter sayeth, ciuitas London habeat omnes suas Libertates antiquas &c. aboute the time of king Iohn, London was reputed regna firmata Columna, as Alexander Necham writeth, and in the beginning of the raigne of Richard the second, it was called Camera regis, as Thomas Walsingham reporteth. I passe ouer the recital of the Saxon Charter of king W. the Conqueror the latine Charters of Henry the first, and second of Richarde the first, of Iohn, and of Edward the first (all which gaue vnto the Citizens of London great Priueledges) and of Edwarde the thirde, who reciting all the grants of his Predicessors, not onely confirmed but also increased the same, and of the latter kinges who haue likewise added many thinges thereunto. Onely I wish to bee noted by them that during all this time all those wise and politique Princes haue thought it fitte not onely to maintaine London in such plight as they found it, but also to adorne, increase and amplifie it with singular tokens of their liberall fauour and good liking. And whether there be not now the same or greater causes to draw the like or better estimation, and cherishing, let any man bee iudge, that will take the paines to compare the present estate of London, (yet still growing to better, with the former condition of the same.
               
                  It were too much to recite particularly the martiall seruices, that this Citie hath done from time to time: neither do I thinke that they be all committed to writing, onely for a tast (as it were) I will note these few following.
               Almost 60. yeares before the Conquest, a huge Armie of the Danes (whereof king Sweyne was the leader,) besieged king Etheldred in London, (then the which as the storie sayeth then he had none other refuge) but they were manfully repulsed, and a greate number of them slaine.
               After the death of this Sweyn, his sonne Canutus (afterward king of England) besieged London, both by Land and Water: but after much labour, finding it impregnable, he departed: and in the same yeare repayring his forces, he girded it with a new siege, in the which the Citizens so defended themselues, and offended him that in the end hée went away with shame.
               In the dissention that arose betwéene king Edward the Confessor, & his father in law Earle Goodwin (which was the mightiest subiect within this land that euer I haue read of.) The Earle with a great Armie came to London, and was for all that by the countenance of the Citizens resisted, till such time as the Nobilitie made reconciliation betwéene them. About 70. yeares after the Conquest Maude the Empresse made warre vppon king Stephen for the right of the Crowne, and had taken his person prisoner, but by the strength and assistance of the Londoners and Kentishmen, Maude was put to flight at Winchester, and her brother Robert then Earle of Glocester, was taken in exchange for whome king Stephen was deliuered, I dispute not whose right was better, but I auouch the seruice, seeing Stephen was in possession.
               The Historie of VVilliam VValworth the Maior of London, is well knowne, by whose manhoode and policie, the person of king Richarde the second was rescued, the Citie saued, Wat Tiler killed,After the common opinion of men of late times. and all his stranglers discomfited, in memory and reward of which seruice the Cittie had a Daggar added to their shielde of Armes, and the Maiors haue beene most commonly sithens knighted.
               
                  Iacke Cade also hauing discomfited the kinges Armie, that  was sent against him, came to London, and was there manfully and with long fight resisted, vntill that by the good policie of the Citizens his company was dispersed.
               Finally in the tenth yeare of the raigne of king Edwarde the fourth, and not many dayes before the death of Henry the sixt, Thomas Neuell, (commonly called the Bastarde of Fauconbridge,) armed a great Company against the king, and being denied passage through London, he assaulted it on diuers parts: but he was repulsed by the Citizens, and chased as far as Stratforde with the losse of a great many.
               Thus much of certaine their principall, and personall seruices, in wa
                     •
                   onely, for it were infinite to repeate the particular aides of men and money
                     •
                   which London hath ministred: and I had rather to leaue it to be coniectured at by comparison to be made betwéene it, & othercities, whereof I will giue you this one note for an example. In the 12. yeare of the raigne of king Edward the 2. it was ordered by Parliament, that euery Citty of the Realme shoulde make out souldiours against the Scots: at which tyme London was appointed to send 200. men, and Canterbury (being then one of our best Citties) 40. and no more. And this proportion of fiue to one, is now in our age increased, at the least fiue to one, both in souldiers and subsidie. As for the other seruices that London hath done in times of peace, they are to be measured by consideration of the commodities whereof I will speake anon. In the meane season let the estate and gouernment of this Citie be considered to the end that it may appeare that it standeth well with the policie of the Realme.
               
                  Caesar in his Commentaries is witnes, that in his time the Cities of Britain had large Teritories annexed vnto them, and were seuerall estates of them selues gouerned by particular kinges or Potentates, as in Italie and Germany, et bee: and that Mandubratius was king of the Trinobantes, whose chiefe Citie London is taken to haue been: And I find not that this & gouernment was altered eyther by Caesar, or his successors, notwithstanding that the Countrie became tributorie vnto them: but that it continued vntill at the length the Britons themselues reduced all their peoples into one Monarchy, howbeit that lasted not any long  season: for vpon Vortiger their king came the Saxons our Auncestors, and they draue the Britons into Wales, Cornwall, and Britaine, in France, and in processe of Warre deuided the Country amongst themselues into an Eptarchie, or seauen kingdomes, of the which one was called the kingdome of the East Saxons, which hauing in manner the same limmites that the Bishopricke of London now enioyeth, contayned Essex, Middlesex, and a part of Hertfordshire, and so included London. Againe it appeareth that in course of time, and about 
                     •
                  800. yeares after Christ, Egbert (then king of the West Saxons) Vt pisces saepe minutos magnus comest, ouercame the rest of the kinges, and once more erected a Monarchie, the which till the comming in of the Normans, and from thence euen hetherto hath continued.
               Now I doubt not (whatsoeuer London was in the time of Caesar) but that vnder the Eptarchie and Monarchie it hath béene a subiect, and no frée Citie, though happily endowed with some large Priuiledges, for king William the Conqueror founde a Portréeue there whose name was Godfrey (by which name hee gréeteth him in his Saxon Chre) and his office was none other then the charge of a Bayliffe, or Réeue, as by the selfe same name continuing yet in Grauesend, and certaine other places may well appeare. But the Frenchmen vsing their owne language, called him sometime a Prouost, and sometime a Bayliffe, whatsoeuer his name and office were, he was perpetuus Magistratus giuen by the Prince, and not chosen by the Citizens, as it séemeth, for what time king Richarde the first néeded money towardes his expedition in the Holy Land, they first purchased of him the Liberty to choose yearely from amongst themselues two Bayliffes: And king Iohn his successor, at their like suite changed their Bayliffes into a Maior, and two sheriffes. To these Henry the thirde added Aldermen, at the first elegible yearelie, but afterward by king E. the thirde made perpetuall Magistrates, and Iustices of the peace within their wardes, in which plight of gouernment it presentlie standeth. This shortlie as I could is the Historicall and outward estate of London: now come I to the inwarde pith & substance.
               The estate of this City is to bee examined by the quantitie and by the qualitie.
               
                  The quantitie therefore consisteth in the number of the Citizens which is very great and farre exceedeth the proportion of Hippodamus which appointed 10000. & of others which haue set downe other numbers as méete styntes in their opinions to bée well gouerned, but yet seeing both reason and experience haue freed vs from the law of any definite number, so that other things bée

                  serued, let that bee admitted: neyther is London (I feare mée) so great as populous: for well sayeth onē, non idem est magna ciuitas & frequens, magna est enim quae multos habet qui arma ferre possunt, whatsoeuer the number bée, the bréedeth no feare of sedition: forasmuch as the same consisteth not in the extreames, but in a verie mediocrity of Welth and riches, as it shall better appeare anone. And if the causes of English rebellions be searched out, they shall be found in effect to bee these twaine, Ambition, and Couetousnes, of which the first raigneth in the mindes of high and noble personages, or of such others, as séeke to be gratious and popular, and haue robbed the heartes of the multitude, whereas in London if any where in the worlde, honos veré onus est, and euery man rather shunneth then séeketh the Maioraltie which is the best marke amongst them, neyther hath there béene any strong faction, nor any man more popular then the rest, forasmuch as the gouernment is by a Paterne (as it were) and alwaies the fame, how often soeuer they change their Magistrate. Couetousnes, (that other Syre of sedition) possessth the miserable and néedy sort, and such as be naughty packes, vnthrifts, (which although it cannot be chosen, but ye in a frequent City as London is, there shalbée found many) yet beare they not any great sway, séeing the multitude and most part there is of a competent welth, and earnestly bent to honest labour, I confesse that London is a mighty arme and instrument to bring any great desire to effect, it it may be won to a mans deuotion: whereof also there want not examples in the English Historie. But forasmuch as the same is by the like reason seruiceable and méete to impeach any disloyall attempt, let it rather be well gouerned then euil liked therfore, for it shal appeare anon that as London hath adhered to som rebelliōs, so hath it resisted many & was neuer ye author of any one. The quality of this city consisteth eyther in the law & gouernment  thereof: or in the degrées and condition of the Citizens, or in their strength and riches.
               It is besides the purpose, to dispute, whether the estate of the gouernment here bee a Democratie, or Aristocratie, for whatsoeuer it bée being considered in it selfe, certaine it is, that in respect of the whole Realme, London is but a Citizen, and no cittie, a subiect and no free estate, an obedienciarie, and no place endowed, with any distinct or absolute power, for it is gouerned by the same law, that the rest of the Realme is, both in causes Criminall and Ciuill, a few customes onely excepted, which also are to bee adiudged, or foriudged by the common law. And in the assembly of the estates of our Realme (which wée call Parliament) they are but a member of the Comminaltie, and send two Burgesses, for their citie, as euery poore Borough doth, and two knights for their County as euerie other shire doth, and are as straightlie bound by such lawes as any part of the Realme is, for if contribution in subsidie of money to the Prince be decréede, the Londoners haue none exemption, no not so much as to assesse themselues: for the Prince doth appoint the commissioners.
               If Souldiers must be mustered, Londoners haue no law to keepe themselues at home, if prouision for the Princes householde bée to be made, their goodes are not Priueledged. In summe therefore the gouernment of London differeth not in substance, but in ceremonie from the rest of the Realme, as namely, in the names and choise of their officers, and in their Guildes and Fraternities, established for the maintenance of Handicraftes, and Labourers and for equitie and good order, to bee kept in buying and selling. And yet in these also are they to bée controlled by the general law for by the statutes 28. E. 3. Chap. 10. and 1. H. 4. Cha. 15. the pointes of their misgouernment are inquirable by the inhabitants of the Forren shires adioyning and punishable by such Iusticiars as the Prince shall thereunto depute, to conclude therefore the estate of London for gouernment is so agreeable a Symphony with the rest, that there is no feare of dangerous discord to ensue thereby.
               The multitude (or whole bodie) of this populous Citie is two waies to bee considered, generally, and specially, generally  they bée naturall subiectes, a part of the commons of this Realme and are by birth for the most part a mixture of all countries of the same, by bloud Gentlemen, Yeomen, and of the basest sorte, without distinction: and by profession busie Bées, and trauellers for their liuing in the Hiue of this common welth, but specially considered, they consist of these thrée partes, Marchantes, Handicrafts men, and Labourers. Marchandize is also deuided into these thrée sortes, Nauigation, by the which Marchandizes are brought, and carried in and out ouer the Seas, Inuection by the which commodities are gathered into the Citie, and dispersed from thence into the Countrie by land and negotiation, which I may call the kéeping of a retayling or standing shop. In common speech they of the first sort bée called Marchantes, and both the other Retaylers, Handicraftes men be those which do exercise such artes as require both labour and cunning, as Goldsmithes, Taylors and Habberdashers, Skinners &c. Labourers and Hirelinges, I cal those quorum operae non artes emuntur, as Tullie sayeth, of which sorte be Portars, Carmen, Watermen &c. Againe these thrée sortes may be considered eyther in respect of their welth, or number: in welth Marchantes, and some of the chiefe Retaylers haue the first place, the most part of Retaylers, and all artificers: the second or meane place, and Hyrelinges the lowest roome: but in number they of the middle place, be first, and do 
                     •
                  arre exceede both the rest: Hyrelinges be next, and Marchantes bee the last. Now, out of this, that the estate of London, in the persons of the Citizens, is so frendly interlaced, and knit in league with the rest of the realme, not onely at their beginning by birth and bloude as I haue shewed, but also very commonlie at their ending by life and conuersation (for that Marchantes and rich men being satisfied with gaine doe for the most part) marrie their children into the Countrie, and conuey themselues after Cicerors counsell, Veluti ex portu in agros et possessiones: I doe inferre that there is not onely no danger towardes the common quiet thereby, but also great occasion and cause of good loue and amitie: out of this, that they bée generally bent to trauell and do flie pouertie, per mare, per saxa, per ignes, as the Poet sayeth, I draw hope, that they shall escape the note of many vices, which idle people doe fall into  And out of this, that they bee a greate multitude, and that yet the greatest part of them bée neyther too rich not too poore, but doe liue in the mediocritie, I conclude with Aristotle that the Prince néedeth not to feare sedition by them, for thus sayeth hee. Magnae vrbes, magis sunt a seditione liberae, quod in eis dominetur mediocritas, nam in paruis nihil medium est, sunt enim omnes vel pauperes vel opulenti. I am now to come to the strength and power of this Citie, which consisteth partly in the number of the Citizens themselues, whereof I haue spoken before, partly in their riches, and in their warlike furniture, for as touching the strength of the peece it selfe that is apparant to the eye, and therefore is not to bée treated of.
               The welth and warlicke furniture of London is eyther publicke of priuate, and no doubt the common trasure cannot be much there, seeing that the reuenew which they haue, hardly sufficeth to maintaine their Bridge and Conduites, and to pay their officers and seruantes. Their Tolle doth not any more then pay their Fée Ferme, that they pay to the Prince. Their Issues for default of Appearances be neuer leuied, and the profites of their courtes of Iustice, do go to particular mens handes. Arguments hereof bée these twoo: one that they can doe nothing of extraordinarie charge, without a generall contribution: an other that they haue suffered such, as haue borne the chiefe office amongst them, and were become Bankrupt, to depart the Citie, without releefe: which I thinke they neyther would nor could haue done, if the common treasure had sufficed to couer their shame, hereof therefore wée néede not be afraid. The publike armour and munition of this City remayneth in the Halles of the Companies, as it doth throughout the whole Realme, for a great part in the parrish churches, neyther is that kept together, but onely for obedience to the law, which commandeth it, and therefore if that threaten danger to the estate, it may (by another law) be taken from them, and committed to a more safe Armourie.
               The Priuate riches of London resteth chiefly in the handes of the Marchantes, and Retaylers, for Artificers haue not much to spare, and Labourers hau neede that it were giuen vnto them. Now how necessarie and seruiceable the estate of Marchandize is  to this Realm, if may partly appeare by the practise of that peaceable, politike, and rich Prince king Henry the seauenth, of whom Polidore (writing his life) sayeth thus, Mercatores ille saepenumero pecunia multa data gratuitò iuuabat, vt mercatura (ars vna omnium cunctis aequè mortalibus tum cōmoda, tum necessaria) in suo regno copiosior esset. But chiefly, by the inestimable commodities that grow thereby: for who knoweth not that wee haue extreame néede of many thinges, whereof forraine countries haue great store, and that wee may spare many thinges whereof they haue neede? or who is ignorant of this that wee haue no mines of siluer or golde within our Realme? so that the increase of our coyne, and Bulloine commeth from else where, and yet neuerthelesse we be both fed, clad, and otherwise serued with forreine commodities and delightes, as plentiful as with our domestical: which thing commeth to passe by the meane of marchandize onely, which importeth necessaries from other countries, and exporteth the superfluities of our own. For seeing we haue no way to encrease our treasure by mines of gold or siluer at home, and can haue nothing without money or Ware from other countries abroad, if followeth necessarily, that it we follow the councel of that good old Husband Marcus Cato, saying, oportet patrem familias vendacem esse, non emacem, and do carrie more cō
                  modities in value ouer the seas, then wée bring hether from thence: that then the Realme shall receiue that ouerplus in money: but if we bring from beyond the seas marchandize of more value, then that which we do send ouer may counteruaile, then the Realme payeth for the ouerplus in readie money, and consequently is a looser by that ill husbandrie: and therefore in this part great and héedefull regard must be had that Symmetria, and due proportion be kept, least otherwise, eyther the Realme bee defrauded of her treasure, or the subiectes corrupted in vanitie, by excessiue importation of superfluous and néedelesse Marchandize, or els that we féele penurie, euen in our greatest plentie and store by immoderate exportation of our owne néedefull commodities. Other the benefites that marchandize bringeth, shall hereafter appeare in the generall recitall of the commodities that come by London: and therefore  it resteth that I speake a worde of Retaylors, and finally shew that much good groweth by them both. The chiefe parte of retayling is but a handmaid to marchandize, dispersing by péecemeale that which the marchant bringeth in grosse: of which trade be Mercers, Grocers, Uinteners, Haberdashers, Ironmongers, Millayners, & all such as sell wares growing or made beyond the seas: & therefore so long as Marchandize it selfe shalbe profitable, & such proportion kept as neyther wée loose our treasure thereby, nor bee cloyed with vnnecessarie forrein Wares, this kinde of retayling is to be retayned also.
               Now that Marchantes and Retaylers of London be very rich and greate, it is so farre from any harme, that it is a thing both praise worthie, and profitable: for Mercatura (sayeth Cicero) si tenuis est, fordida putanda est, sin magna est & copiosa non est vituperanda. And truely Marchantes and Retaylers doe not altogether intus Canere, and profit themselues onely, for the Prince, and Realme both are enriched by their riches: the Realm winneth treasure, if their trade be so moderated by authority, that it breake not proportion, & they besides beare a good fléece which the Prince may sheare when shée séeth good,
               But heere before I conclude this part, I have shortly to aunswere the accusation of those men, which charge London with the losse and decay of many (or most) of the auncient Cities, Corporate Townes, and Marketes within this Realme, by drawing from them to her selfe alone (say they) both all trade of traffique by sea, and the retayling of wares, and exercise of manuall artes also. Touching Nauigation, which (I must confesse) is apparantly decayed in many port townes, and flourisheth only
                     •
                   or chiefly at London, I impute that, partly to the fall of the Staple (the which béeing long since a great trade, and bestowed sometimes at one town and sometimes at an other within the Realme, did much enrich the place where it was: & being now not onely diminished in force, but also translated ouer the seas, cannot but bring some decay with it (partly to the empayring of Hauens, which in many places haue empouerished those Townes, whose estate doth ebbe and 
                     •
                  low with them, and partly to the dissolution of Religious houses,  by whose welth and haunt, many of those places were chiefly fed and nourished. I meane not to rehearse particular examples of euery sorte: for the thing it selfe speaketh, and I hast to an ende: As for Retaylers therefore, and Handicraftes men, it is no maruaile if they abandon Countrie Townes, and resort to London: for of nonely the Court, (which is now a dayes much greater and more gallant then in former times, and which was wont to bee contented to remain with a smal company, sometimes at an Abbey or Priorie, sometimes at a Bishops house, and sometimes at some meane Mannor of the kings own) is now for the most part eyther abiding at London, or els so neare vnto it, that the prouision of thinges most fit for it, may easily be fetched from thence: but also by occasion thereof the Gentlemen of all shires do flie, and flocke to this City, the yonger sorte of them to sée and shew vanitie, and the elder to saue the cost and charge of Hospitality, and house kéeping. For hereby it commeth to passe that the Gentlemen being eyther for a good portion of the yeare out of the Countrie, or playing the Fermours, Grasiars, Brewers or such like, more then Gentlemen were wont to doe within the Countrie, Retaylers and Artificers, at the least of such thinges as pertaine to the backe or belly, do leaue the Countrie townes where there is no vent, and do flie to London, where they be sure to finde ready and quicke market. And yet I wish, that euen as many townes in the Low Countries of king Phillips do stand some by one handy arte and some by an other: so also that it might be prouided here, that the making of some thinges might (by discrete dispensation) be allotted to some speciall Townes, to the end, that although the dayntenesse of men cannot be restrayned, which will néedes séeke those thinges at London, yet other places also might bee reléeued, at the least by the Workemanshippe of them.
               Thus much then of the estate of London, in the gouernment thereof, in the condition of the Citizens, and in their power and riches. Now follow the enumeration of such benefites as rebound to the Prince and this realme by this City: In which doing I professe not to rehearse all, but onely to recite and runne ouer the chiefe and principall of them.
               
                  Besides the commodities of the furtherance of Religion and Iustice: The propagation of Learning: The maintenance of artes: The increase of riches, and the defence of Countries (all which are before shewed to grow generally by Cities, and bee common to London with them) London bringeth singularlie these good thinges following.
               By aduantage of the scituation it disperseth forraine Wares (as the stomacke doth meat) to all the members most commodiously.
               By the Benefite of the riuer of Thames, and greate trade of Marchandize, it is the chiefe maker of Marriners, and Nurse of our Nauie: and ships (as men know) bee the wodden walles for defence of our Realme.
               It maintayneth in florishing estate, the Countries of Norfolke, Suffolke, Essex, Kent, and Sussex, which as they lie in the face of our most puissant neighbour, so ought they (aboue others) to be conserued in the greatest strength and riches: and these (as it is well known) stand not so much by the benefite of their own soile, as by the neighbourhood and nearenes which they haue to Londō.
               
               It releeueth plentifully, and with good policie, not onely her owne poore people (a thing which scarcely any other Towne or shire doth) but also the poore that from ech quarter of the realme do flocke vnto it, and it imparteth liberally to the necessitie of the Uniuersities besides. It is an ornament to the realm by the bewtie thereof, & a terror to other countries by reason of the greate welth and frequencie. It spreadeth the honor of our Countrie far abroade by her long nauigations, and maketh our power feared, euen of barbarous Princes. It onely is stored with rich Marchantes which sort onely is tollerable: for beggerlie Marchants, do byte too neare, & will do more harme then good to the realme. It onely of any place in this realme is able to furnish the sodaine necessitie with a strong Army. It auaileth the prince in Tonnage, Poundage and other her customes, much more then all the rest of the Realme.
               It yeeldeth a greater Subsidie then any one part of the realme, I meane not for the proportion of the value of the goodes onely,  but also for the faithfull seruice there vsed, in making the assesse, for no where else bee men taxed so neare to their iust value as in London: yea manye are founde there, that for their countenaunce and credite sake, refuse not to bee rated aboue their abilitie, which thing neuer happeneth abroade in the countrie. I omit that in auncient time, the inhabitantes of London and other cities, were accustomably taxed after the tenth of their goodes, when the Countrie was assessed at the fiftéenth, and rated at the viij.when the countrie was set at the xij.for that were to awake a sléeping Dogge, and I should be thought dicenda, tacenda, locutus, as the Poet said.
               It onely doth and is able to make the Prince a ready prest or loane of money.
               It onely is founde fit and able to entertaine strangers honorablie, and to receaue the Prince of the realme worthely.
               Almightie God (qui nisi custo diat ciuitatem, frustra vigilat custos) grant, that her Maiestie euermore rightly estéeme and rule this Citie, and he giue grace, that the Citizens may answere duty, aswell towards God and her Maiestie, as towardes this whole realme and countrie, Amen.
               
            
         
         
            An Appendix containing the examination of such causes as haue heretofore moued the Princes, eyther to fine and ransome the citizens of London, or to seize the liberties of the City it selfe.
            THese all may be reduced to these few heads: for eyther the citizens haue adheared (in aide or armes) to such as haue warred vpon the Prince: or they haue made tumult, and broken the common peace at home: or they haue misbehaued themselues in point of gouernement and iustice: or finally (and to speake the plain truth) the princes haue taken hold of small matters, and coyned good summes of money out of them.
            To the first head I will referre whatsoeuer they haue done eyther  in those warres that happened betwéene king Stephen and Maude the Empresse, being competitors of the crowne: or betwéene king Iohn & his nobles assisting Lewes the French kinges sonne when he inuaded the realme: for it is apparent by all histories, that the Londoners were not the mouers of these warres, but were onely vsed as instruments to maintaine them. The like is to be said of all the offences that king Henry the third (whose whole raigne was a continuall warfare) conceyued against this Cittie, concerning the bearing of armour against him; for the first part of his raigne was spent in the continuation of those warres that his father had begun with Lewes. And the rest of his life he bestowed in that contention, which was commonly called the Barons warres. In which Tragedie London (as it could not bee otherwise) had now and then a part, and had many a snubbe at the kinges hand for it. But in the end when hee had triumphed ouer Simon Mountford at Euesham, London felt it most tragicall: for then he both seysed their liberties, and sucked themselues drie: and yet Edictum Kenelworth (made shortly after) hath an honorable testimony for London, saying, Te London laudamus &c. As for the other offences that hee tooke against the Londoners, they pertaine to the other parts of my diuision.
            Next after this, against whom the Londoners did put on armes, followeth king Edward the second, who in the ende was depriued of his kingdome, not by their meanes, but by a generall defection, both of his owne wife and sonne, and almost of the whole nobilitie and realme besides. In which trouble, that furious assault, and slaughter committed by them vpon the Bishop of Excester (then Treasurer of the Realme) is to be imputed, partly to the sway of the time wherewith they were caried, and partly to a priuate displeasure which they had to the Bishop.
            Finally commeth to hand King Richard the second: for these thrée onley in all the Catalogue of our kinges, haue béene heauie Lordes to London, who also had much contention with his nobilitie, and was in the ende deposed. But whatsoeuer countenance and aide the Citie of London brought to the warres and vprores of that time, it is notoriously true that London neuer ledde the dance, but euer followed the pipe of the nobility. To close vp this  first part therefore I affirme, that in all the troublesome actions during the raignes of these thrée kinges, as also in all that heauing in, and hurling out, that afterward happened betwéene K. Henry the 6. & king Edward the fourth, the citie of London was many times a friende and fautor, but neuer the first motiue or author of any intestine war or sedition.
            In the second roome I place a couple of tumultuous affraies that chaunced in the daies of King Richard the first, the one vpon the day of his coronation against the Iewes, which contrary to the Kings owne proclamation, would néedes enter the Church to sée him sacred, and were therefore cruelly handled by the common people. The other was caused by William with the long beard, who after that he had inflamed the poore people against the richer sort, and was called to answere for his fault, tooke Bow Church for sanctuarie, and kept it Castle like, till he was fiered out.
            Here is place also for the stoning to death of a Gentleman (seruant to the halfe brother of King Henry the third) which had before prouoked the Citizens to furie by wounding diuers of them without any cause 1257. for the riotous fray betwéene the seruants of the Goldsmithes and the Taylors, 1268. for the hurlie burlie and bloodshed betwéen the Londoners and the men of Westminster, moued by the youngmen vpon an occasion of a wrestling on S. Iames day, 1221. & made worse by one Constantine an ancient Citizen: for the braule and businesse that arose about a Bakers loafe at Salisbury place 1391. for the which and some other misdemeanors K. Richard the 2. was so incensed by euill counsell against the Londoners, that he determined to destroy them, and raze their Citie, and for the fight that was betweene the citizens & Sanctuarie men of S. Martins 1454. vnder K. Henry the sixt. And finally for the misrule on euill May day 1519. and for such other like, if there haue beene any.
            To the third head may be referred the seiser of their liberties, for a false iudgement giuen against a poore widow, called Margaret Viel 1246. The 2. seueral seisers in one yere 1258. for fals packing in collections of money and other enormities: And finally the seiser made by King Edward the first for taking bribes of the Bakers 1285. But all this seueritie in seising and resuming of the  liberties (which was in old time the onely ordinary punishment) was at length mitigated by king Edward the third, and King Henry the fourth in their statutes before remembred.
            In the last place stand those offences, which I repute rather taken then giuen, and do fall within the measure of the adage, vt canem cedas, cito inuenias baculum: for King Iohn in the tenth of his raigne deposed the Bayliefes of London, because they had bought vp the Wheate in the market, so that there was not to serue his Purueyers. King Henry the third his sonne compelled the Londoners to pay him 5000. 
                  •
               . because they had lent to Lewes the French the like summe, of a good mind to dispatch him out of their Citie and the realme, at such time as the Protector and the whole Nobility fell to composition with him for his departure. And the same King fined them at thrée thousand markes, for the escape of a prisoner out of Newgate, of whom they tooke no charge: for he was a Clearke, prisoner to the Bishop of London vnder the custody of his owne seruants, and as for the place, it was onely borrowed of the Londoners to serue that turne. Hitherto of these things to this ende, that whatsoeuer misdemeanor shalbe obiected out of historie against London, the same may herein appeare, both in his true place
                  •
                and proper colour.
            
               BEcause amongst other mine Authors I haue oft times alledged Fitz-Stephens, as one more choise then other, namely for the auncient estate of this Citie, more then three hundred yeares since: And also the said Author being rare, (as to my knowledge) not extant out of mine owne custodie, I haue in this place thought good by impression to imparte the same to my louing friendes, the learned Antiquaries as the Authour wrote it in the Latine tongue. And first to note in effect, what M. Bale in commendation of the said Authour writeth.

Such time as other spent in braules, and idle talke, hee employed in holesome exercises for the honour of his countrey, following therein the example of Plato: and was very studious both in humanitie and diuinitie. The Citie of London his birth place, the most noble of all other Cities of this land, and the Princes seate, situated in the South part of this Iland, he loued aboue al the other: so that at length he wrote most elegantly in latine of the site and rites of the same. Leland in diuers of his bookes commendeth him for an excellent writer. Hee liued in the raigne of king Stephen, wrote in the raigne of Henry the second, & deceased in the yeare of Christ 1191. in the raigne of Richard the first.
