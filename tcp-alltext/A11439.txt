               Here is declared, if you wyl rede
               That god doth loue this lād in dede
               By felynge his rod.
            
            ENgland is blest, & loued of god
            who can the same deny
            For she hath felt his louin
                  •
                rod
            because she went awrye.
            Deserue she dyd, more to be whypt
            her faultes they were so great
            Who dyd not se, how far she slypt
            from law, and iustice seat.
            The word so frely taught & preacht
            as no land had it more
            When teachers truelye truth them teacht
            they set by it no store.
            They kept it not in hart and minde
            to lead therby theyr lyfe.
            If they had ben to God so kynde
            then had not come the stryfe.
            
               But so longe as they hard the voise
            full styl they were as shepe
            Al huste & peace, there was no noise
            but silence they did kepe.
            And streight as sermon ended was
            they fayd that he sayde wel
            But aske them how his wordes dyd passe
            & then they could not tel.
            And some there semed to be so ful
            that they woulde heare no more
            Theyr sprites & eares wer waxē dul
            they cared not therefore.
            Al knoledge had they caught & won
            as they had in theyr thought
            So that wt spede theyr harts begon
            to set by it as nought.
            And fell to sekyng land and good
            by rape and eke vnrighte
            As men ful mad and worldly wood
            from measure flyeng quight.
            For glory eke and earthly prayse
            some soughte as they were mad
            Not sparing by vnlauful wayes
            so they in sylkes were clad.
            
               Promotion some so swiftly soughte
            to place theyr bloud on hie
            That frēd or foe they spared nought
            tho they therfore shuld dye.
            To be forsworne, it was no synne
            the custome made it law
            So they a lyfe at ease might wynne
            of God they had no awe.
            Tho lawe did wyl of Idoles foyl
            but few with wyl them burst
            But al content to take the spoyles
            not thinkyng them a curst.
            Of pride, of enuye, and disdayne
            Whose hart was not possest
            Of wanton eyes and lustes so vaine
            Who longe from these dyd reste.
            So geuen to sectes and fables fond
            so bent to tales vntrue
            So geuen to lyes as any londe
            styl lustyng thinges of new.
            Who dyd not se, that had his eyes
            these vyces so to raygne
            That scourge & plague must nedes arise
            to bring thē home agayn.
            
               Then came the rod by death to kyl
            the prince that was full good
            And let such tyrantes haue their wil
            as shed the giltles bloud.
            At large were set al wicked men
            and good men put to thral
            Ful lytle thought so soden then
            that they shuld haue the baul.
            The synnes that long had takē rote
            and blossomes ful dyd bear
            The wyllyng eare and redy fote
            false witnes for to heare:
            Was punisht then by Ipocrites
            and men that had no God
            and such as past not of .ii. mites
            to do the thinge forbod.
            By this meanes men yt were wtoute
            and loked vpon our land
            Did bring in question and in doute
            how that this gere could stande.
            Sayeng to God he dyd not loue
            the English bloud at all
            Because he dyd the swete remoue
            and sent them bitter gall
            
               To that his word did answer make
            and toke his cause in hande
            Affyrming God not to forsake
            the lytle Ile England.
            Whom God doth loue, then said his lore
            the same he doth correcte
            Least they shuld dye in hel therfore
            and so for aye reiecte.
            Also to proue and trye his vine
            he let that the defence
            Of romishe bores, and sowish swine
            should quight be taken thence.
            A forrein lande to set in foote
            he winked at also
            To proue a case by fourme of mote
            that sinners myght hym knowe.
            And whyles the word & carnal men
            dyd reason thus a whyle
            To make yt eche his wyl should ken
            he strayght began to smyle.
            Hold styl he sayd, I wyl be iudge
            and sentence strayght he gaue
            quod he to death se that thou trudge
            and fyl thou vp a graue.
            
               A graue quod he, wher may that be
            and who shal therin lye
            & straight was sene ye english quene
            al prone and fyt to dye.
            
               The roussed vp deth & cast his dart
            and cloue her hart in twayne
            Then lay she dead, yt causde ye smart
            that fel vpon Britayne.
            Death then had thought, yt he had done
            & wold haue taken rest
            nay nay sayd God, thou hast begon
            therfore I thinke it best:
            That thou do kyl more of my foes
            that would my wil withstand
            Then found he out, as tumor goes
            some captaynes of the band.
            He made thē shrīk for al theyr brags
            and burst their bandes in twayne
            He pluckt thē quite out of their iags
            thus by him were they slayne.
            Lo lo sayd God, now haue I tolde
            my sentence and my wyl
            And I my self haue ben so bold
            my foes by death to kyll.
            
               For this let vs geue thankes to him
            and praise his holy name
            And nowe let vs with hartes begin
            a better life to frame.
            Let al confesse the mercy of God
            the cause to be alone
            Why he hath cast away his rod
            And is with vs at one.
            prayeng to him, that he wyll geue
            vnto this ruler sent
            A wylling mind while she doth lyue
            as alwayes she was bent.
            To set vp God, and godlynes
            the truth for to restore
            To banyshe out pope holines
            by law for euermore.
            Let al degrees vpon theyr knees
            thus pray with one consent
            That he which sees our miseries
            may better be content.
            Now to conclude my metre rude
            but matter true and iust
            se you repent your lyfe mysspent
            Or els be sure and trust:
            
               That God wyl strike, & strike again
            a sharper stroke then this
            That you shal fele wt greater payne
            be sure he wyl not mysse.
            Finis.
