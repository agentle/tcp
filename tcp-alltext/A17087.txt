concerning the burnynge
of Bucer and Phagius,
at Cambrydge, in the tyme of
Quene Mary, with theyr restitution
in the time of our moste gracious
souerayne Lady that nowe is.
Wherein is expressed the fantasticall
and tirannous dealynges of the
Romishe Church, togither with the
godly and modest regimēt of the
true Christian Church, most
slaunderouslye diffamed
in those dayes of
heresye.

let him ioyne the iudgement of theyr
dāned dedes. And discerne that theyr
faith, (whose iustification they iustly
flye) by the filthines of theyr frutes.
Which reason, was whilom among
them of such force, that in stede of disprouing
doctrine, they curiously searched
others innocent liues, as blamelesse
them selues. Not fearing (as the
abhominable harlotte, who vpbrayded
her chaste neyghbour with her
owne shame) most impudently to appeache
others of vnhonest life, where
thē selues are so staynd with al kinde
of vncleannes, as but for that shamelesse
dissemblinge, which serueth thē
to so many mischieues, theyr conscyences
would euen in theyr blushyng
faces, crie y• contrary to theyr shamelesse
wordes. Neyther minde I by a
fewe to defame them all, or by a rascall



noumber to stayne the best, but
euen with historical sincerity, to propose
the paterne of the perfectst, that
as the iudgemente is like of thinges
alike, so much more plainelye mayst
thou d

               me, what the rascal rable be,
when the best be such. So wilye in
worldly affaires, arguinge their ignoraunce
in spirituall: So dissēbling
in al their dealing, cloking (not cancelling
their crimes: So cruell vnder
colour of disguised mercye: So farced
with fables sor fatherlye doctrine,
Suche deluders euen of the learned
vniuersity, as though forgetting him
whō no mā may deceiue, & measurīg
religion by worldly estimation, they
had madlye proposed dissembling deceyt
the end of theyr lewd profession.
yf they thē whom the simple sort had
vainly in such admiration, so deluded
our expectacion, euen in that time,
when both theyr wittes & learnings
chiefelye flourished, & power wanted
not to assist their wordes: if thē I say
those yelded such rottē frutes of their
great conceyued hope, alas what is



to be loked for, eyther of the same yet
liuinge, (crueltye the mightiest bulwarke
of theyr doctrine wanting:) or
of the rest, whō neither wit nor worthines
hath raysed either to so learned
iudgement, or to so graue report
For to ouerpasse the rest, (againste
whō, theyr causeles pitied state bids
sparelye to speake,) who worshipped
Ormanet any lesse thē a liuīg saint▪
who estemed him otherwise than the
angel that should disclose the secretes
lodged in the cardinals brest

at the first linked it: & waxd cō
               tented
to be the mate of power, & the
meede of the monstruous beaste of
many heades. But shall our good
opinion of theym growe wyth theyr
iust deserued woe? Or shall we conceyue
more of thē vnarmed, whome
the dreadfulst tormentes of fier & famine
could not proue soūdly learned?



Or shal we deme, that rusty corners
yet shroude others, that could speake
muche more? O let vs not be more
wittye, to proue them eyther learned
or godly then them selues are able.
And thou O Reader, as the readyng
of this litle treatyse shall often moue

wherein they were rufull: so if prosperity
haue not wholye blunted the

               appy yeares, wherein, they
are not onelye lothed, sorowed, and
mourned, but euen hated, detested,

the filthe of those wicked Tirauntes,

and fyer, flouryshe the ashes & faine
of theyr weake foes: Theyr beggery
nowe appearyng so beastly, by theyr
fal, as wonted is the death of the deceyuinge
detter to descrie his manye

of his creditours. If you thinke it deserueth
not the name of an historye,
for that pertiallye (perhaps in thy opinion)



the guiltye are touched: consider

wilte forbid him to thinke of eyther
parte what it deserueth, or what he
thinketh to speake. The fyrste of the
whych as thou canst not forclose me,
so the other the benefite of the tyme
graunteth me. In the which to couer
my iust affection, what impiety wer

to weygh my frendly meanyng in al
poyntes (syth what so ener I dyd, I

commoditye to do) I remyt the to

with such fauorable iudgement,
as is due to well
meaning, though it
wante expressing.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               CArdinall Poole, thre
yeares after his returne
into Englād,
hauyng somewhat
wythdrawen hys
mynd from other affaires of the
realme, and hauing in all poyntes
established the Romishe religion
(the which a certaine yeares
past, during the time of king
Edward the .vi. was clerely abolished,
and worne out of custome)
began to haue an eye to
the vniuersitie of Cambrydge,
the which it selfe inespecially semed
to haue nede of reformation
out of hande. For he thought
it should be to no purpose, to bestowe
his trauaile in purginge
the residewe of the bodye, if he
left that parte still infected with
maladies & diseases, frō whēce
al other members should fetche
their strength and nourishemēt.



To performe this charge, were
chosen Cuthbert Scot,
               Thenquisitours. not long
before consecrated bishoppe of
Westchester, Nicolas Ormanet,
an Italian, Archepryeste of the
people of Bodolon, in the dyocesse
of Uexon, professed in both
the lawes: Thomas VVatson,
elected bishop of Lincolne: Iohn
Christoferson, elected byshop of
Chychester: and Henrye Cole
Prouoste of the Colledge of
Eton. There was good cause
whye the matter was inespecially
committed to these persons.
For as touchinge Ormanet, it is
well knowen, that he was a
man of muche estimation wyth
Iulius the thyrde at that tyme
bishop of Rome, whose businesse
they dyd sitte vpon in this Commission,
and that for the same
purpose he was appoynted to



come into Englande wyth Cardinall
Poole, bycause that without
his knowledge, (as in whō
he put his chyefe trust and confidence)
the byshop would haue
nothynge done, that was of any
importance or weyght.
            The residewe were sent thither
eyther for experience in matters
of thuniuersitye, or els they seemed
of all others most meete to
be put in trust with thandlynge
of that case, because they were
taken for moste stoute Champions,
and earnest defenders of
the Romyshe relygion, and of
thinges appertaynynge to the
establyshemente of the same.
            Some were of opinion that
Scot, VVatson, and Chrystophorsonne,
(bycause there was
grudge betwene thē and diuers



of thuniuersitie, at whose hādes
they thought them selues latelye
before to haue receyued displeasure,
and that nowe time and occasion
serued to be reuēged vpon
them as they listed them selues)
busilye procured this iourney
of theyr owne heades.
            These persons thus appoynted,A Citacion sent before.
(in the meane while that they
were addressing them selues to
theyr iourney,) sent theyr letters
before to Andrewe Perne, Uicechauncellor
of thuniuersitye for
that yeare. Commaundyng him
to warne all the Graduates of
thuniuersity in theyr name, to be
present the .xi. daye of Ianuarye
betwixt eyght and tenne of the
clocke, in the church of Saynct
Marie the virgin. (The same is
the place of resorte, when there
is any common assembly or meting



of thuniuersitie, beinge not
farre distante from the market
place of the sayd towne of Cambridge,
whither al men are sommoned,
if at anye time there be
any common prayer, or Suffrages
to be made, or if there be any
man that hath ought to saye
in open audience.) Willing him
inespecially to be there him selfe
in a readinesse, and moreouer to
admonishe all the residewe to
whose charge it belonged, that
they should searche out all Statutes,
bookes, Priuiledges, and
monumentes, appertaynyng to
thuniuersitye, or to anye of the
Colledges, or finallye to anye of
them selues: and there to present
the same before them at the day
appoynted, and euerye man to
appeare there personally. For
they would not faile, but be therat



y• same time, to laye before thē
such thinges as should seme necessarye
to this charge of reforming
the vniuersity, & further to
geue charge of al such things as
should seeme most for the profite
and behoof of the same, togither
with such thinges as were to be
done on theyr part, according as
shold seme most agreable to the
decrees of the Canō law. These
letters the Uicechauncellor caused
to be set vp in places cōuenient.
This reformatiō was loked
for certaine monethes before.
            But now whē it was once certainely
knowen yt it should be in
dede,The disquietnesse of thuniuersitie vpon the tidinges of the reformacion. euery mannes minde was
maruelouslye moued. Some
greatlye reioyced that the tyme
was come, wherin thei thought
they might frely not only speake
but also do what they listed against
their aduersaries, which



before times had reiected the bables
of ye romishe bishop. Other
some perceiuing in what peryll
they stoode, looked narowlye about
them, how to winde them
selues out of the briers. Many
sought the good wil & frendship
of such as were knowen to be in
fauour with the terrible cōmissioners.
Other certaine made thē
selues giltie, & desired forgiuenesse
of them, at whose handes
they thē selues had takē wrong
before. There were also diuers
to be founde, which in time past
counterfeited to be very earnest
embracers of the true doctryne,
but in their liuing and conuersacion
had greatly defaced it, applyinge
to theyr owne fleshelye
lustes, the liberty that appertayneth
of ryghte to the spirite, so
that they thoughte it lawfull to
do what they listed.
            
               These men supposed there was
no way but one to purge theym
selues of theyr misbehauiour,
namely if they became accusers
of those whose frendshippe they
had erewhiles embraced, And
to thentent to make men beleue
that they professed the Romishe
religion frō the bottom of their
hartes, & to currye fauour with
the Commissioners, they promised
to take vpon them the order
of priesthod without delay. For
they knewe the Commissioners
would like that very wel, which
already were in such wise minded,
that as they woulde withholde
no man from that order,
that would offer him selfe thervnto:
so would they by all meanes
endeuor to bring euery man
thereto, that was anye thinge
wittye or learned.
            
               We sayde at the first,The cause whye the reformatiō was taken in hand. that the
Cardinall thoughte the Uniuersitye
to haue nede of reformation.
The reason why he should
thinke so was this: eyther because
the same of long conti
                  •
               uaunce
since anye man coulde remember,
had cast of the yoke of
the bishop of Rome, and cleaued
to the wholsome doctrine of the
Ghospell, which is falsely diffamed
of heresye: or els by reason
that both for the late schisme not
yet worne out of memorye, and
for the doctrine of Martin Bucer
who not longe before openlye
in the sayde Uniuersitye interpreted
holy scripture, they sawe
so manye so sore corrupted and
spotted with this infection, that
(euen as when a fyre is spredde
into a towne onles spedie remedie
were adhibited out of hand)



(it were not possible by all lykelihod)
to quenche it many yeres
after. And it was to be feared (if
it were not looked to in time)
least (as it commonlye commeth
to passe in bodies diseased) thys
mischiefe should take roote, and
by litle and litle infect al the mē
               bers
next vnto it which yet wer
whole and sound.
            This was the yeare of oure
lord. 1556. To thentēt therfore
to make a salue for this sore,The comming of the Inquisitoures, and of their enterteinmēt. the
Cōmissioners of whō we spake
before, came vnto Cambrydge
the ninth day of Ianuary. As
they were yet on theyr iourneye
not farre from the towne, diuers
of the maysters and Presidentes
of the Colledges, mette
them and brought them courteouslye,
first into the towne, and
after to theyr lodging. They



wer enterteined in Trinitie colledge
by Iohn Christoforson
maister of the same house, & lately
before elected bishop of Chichester.
Some were desired to one
place, & some to an other, as ther
was occasion, either to do theyr
duties, or to shewe their good
willes. Cole to the kynges Colledge,
& Watson to .S. Iohns.
But whether it were for thacquaintaunce
of Christophorsō, or
for y• largenes of ye house, (which
forasmuch as it was able to receiue
thē al, semed therfore most
mete & conuenient to take theyr
conferens in, & stoode wel for all
cōmers to haue accesse vnto thē)
they al tooke vp their lodginges
there.An oracion gratulatory at theyr commyng thyther. At their cōming thither an
oracion was made by a felow of
the house, who in the name of al
the rest wt long protestation declared
yt they were most hartely



welcome thither: & that he and
his felowes gaue theym great
thākes, that it had pleased their
lordshippes to haue so good opiniō
of thē, as to chose their house
inespecially to lodge in, wherby
they had both encouraged them
to stande in hope of some
further beneuolence towardes
them, and also done great worship
to theyr Colledge by theyr
beinge there: Wherfore they
shoulde looke at theyr hande againe
for as muche duetye and
reuerence, as lay in their power
to performe. Watson made aunswere,
that this forward & earnest
good willes and minde of
theirs in doinge suche curtesye,
was righte thankefullye taken,
both of him and his, exhortynge
them to continew stedfastlye in
the same, & to procede also whē


               
nede should require: For it was
so farre frō any of their thoughtes,
to stoppe them in this theyr
race, yt they would rather haste
thē forwarde to runne through
more spedily, being not without
good cause perswaded to conceiue
good hope of their beneuolēce
towards thē: in asmuch as
they would do for them, whatsoeuer
might tourne to theyr profyte
and commoditye.
            This daye, forasmuche as it
was towarde euening ere they
came, and the sunne was going
downe, was nothinge els done.
The next day being the tenth of
Ianuarye, they bestowed in recreating
them selues after theyr
iourneye, and in settinge other
thynges at a staye. Neuerthelesse
to thentent the same should
not escape altogither withoute



doing of somewhat, they interdited
the two Churches,Saynt Maries and S. Michaels enterdited. namely
S. Maries where Martyn
Bucer, and S. Michaels where
Paulus Phagius lay buried.
            These men were deade a good
while before. Paulus Phagius
had scarce yet shewed the profe
of his witte and learning when
he departed to God. Bucer liued
a few yeres after. Durīg which
time somewhat by writing, but
chiefly by reading & preachinge
opēly (wherin thold man beyng
painful in y• word of God, neuer
spared hī selfe nor regarded his
health) he brought all mē in such
admiration of him, yt neither his
frendes could sufficiently prayse
him, neither his enemies in any
point finde fault wt his singuler
life & sincere doctrine. A most certaine
token wherof may be his



sūptuous buriall solēnized wt so
great assistēce & gladnes, of all y•
degrees of thuniuersitie, that it
was not possible to deuise more
to the setting out & amplifyinge
of the same. The whole maner &
order of the doing wherof, being
writtē by Nicolas Carre a learned
man, in a litle treatise to the
right worshipful sir Iohn Cheke
knight, wt an epistle ful of cōsolatiō
as concerning his departure
added thereunto, was sent vnto
y• renoumed clerke Peter Martir
thē abiding at Oxford. From
the burial of Bucer and Phagius
vnto y• cōming of these cōmissioners
wer passed about .iii. or .iiii.
yeres more or lesse. And from the
time yt that blessed king, king Edward
ye sixte deceased, vnto that
daye, the priestes neuer ceased to
celebrate theyr Masses, and all



other kinde of Ceremonies in
those places, and that wythout
scruple of conscience, as farre as
men could perceyue. But after
the time that these cōmissioners
came thither, those thinges that
before were accōpted for sacred
and holye, began to be denounced
for prophane and vnholye.
            For they cōmaundedy• all those
assemblies that should hereafter
be made for thexecutinge of holy
Ceremonies, should be remoued
to the kinges Chappell, whyche
is a place farre more stately thē
all thother.
            Now was come the .xi. day,
in the whiche the Uicechauncelour
of the Uniuersitie, with the
maysters and Presidētes of the
Colledges, and al other the graduates
of euery house, were cō
               maunded
to appeare before the



sayd Commissioners. They assēbled
in great number to Trinitie
Colledge: where (as we
tolde you before) they were all
lodged, geuinge attendaunce to
brynge them whether so euer it
should please them to go, accordyng
as it became them to do.
            There Iohn Stokes common
Oratour of thuniuersitye, one of
the popishe supersticiō (for none
other but suche in those dayes
might be promoted to any worship)
made an oratiō in the name
of all the rest. And whereas he
had certaine articles to entreat
vpon appoyncted to him before
by the byshop of Westchester,
and thothers, he talked muche
of thuniuersitye, muche as touchyng
them, and many thinges
also of the religiō in times past,
whyche had bene almost euerye



mannes matter to entreat of, in
euery oraciō, & in euery sermon.
            First of all he said that thuniuersitie,
whyche in lookinge for
theyr comming had ben a while
disquieted, beyng nowe by their
presence greatly refreshed, was
very glad to beholde theyr countenaunce.
In token wherof, the
whole vniuersitye, with all her
studētes was come out by heapes
to welcome thē: & al the houses
in Cambrydge with their studentes
of all degrees were assē
               bled
togither in that place. For
whose certain & tried good willes
in that behalfe, he durst take
vpon him as in the name of thē
all, to warrant theyr honoures,
that euery one of them seuerally
and al in one accorde generally,
did with earnest desire and willinge



hartes, greatlye reioyce at
theyr comminge thyther. For
they were all fullye perswaded,
that the businesse whiche they
went in hande wyth, should be
profitable to the redresse of the
vniuersitye, and that in a matter
so necessarye to the saluacion of
all men, no trauaile nor paynetakynge
should on theyr part be
forslowed. To the confyrmation
of whyche opinion, he sayde
he was able to alledge manye
proofes, howebeit he woulde let
passe all others, and touche none
but those thynges that were so
annexed to the matter that they
had in hande, as by no meanes
they might be well wtdrawen or
seperated frō it: y• which thinges
were in noumber certayne and
determinable, but in effecte and



working infinite: insomuch that
it passed any mannes power to
entreat of them at the full. Neuerthelesse,
he desyred theym to
geue him the hearing paciently,
whiles he made a bryefe dyscourse
of the same. Hereupon
taking a new occasion to talke,
he began fyrste with Cardynall
Poole, saying, that he had restored
the religion troden vnderfoote,
he had vndershored the
common wealth readye to fall
downe, he had brought agayne
(as it were out of exyle) the decrees
and lawes of oure forefathers,
well nye abolyshed and
worne out of memorye. This
Poole, this worthye Englysheman,
our true Moyses, was the
authour of this commission, frō
whose most excellent hyghnesse
as from a moost plentifull welspring



of all vertues, innumerable
commodities had flowed into
all partes of this his natyue
countrey. For the whyche one
bond of alyance, albeit the Uniuersitie
had sufficiente cause to
conceyue good opinion of hym,
forasmuch as he was of the bodye
of the same publyke weale:
yet was there an other more inward
bond, whereby his grace
and they were most streytly linked
together. For the last yeare
past he had taken the same most
gently into his graces protectiō
assuringe by his letters, yt as he
had takē vpon him frely to kepe
it, so also woulde he mainteyne
and defend the same in such sort
that not onely thincommodities
(if there were anye that myght
hinder theyr studyes) shoulde be
remoued, but also wold further



them in all thinges, that myght
redound to the garnishing of the
vniuersitye, or wherby the dignity
& estimaciō of the same might
most be aduaunced or encreased
The which thing had both here
tofore established their hope, and
nowe also brought thē into that
beliefe, yt they must nedes thinke
all his graces gētlenes, to be cō
               ueyed
together into this one visitacion:
In the which they loked
for all such thinges at their handes,
as the tender loue of theyr
most godlye Chauncellour, passing
farre beyōd the cōmon charitie,
had peculiarlye promised to
thuniuersitie as his warde & fatherles
Orphan. He wished that
the Cardinal him selfe had bene
there at the same instant, if it
mighte so haue come to passe,
without hinderance to the common



welth: to thentente y• wyth
his owne beames, & with y• clere
light of true religion, he myghte
haue illumined his vniuersitye
now putting vp her head out of
the depe night of darkenesse.
            Agaynst the which wyshe forasmuch
as the common vtility did
repugne, by the which the moste
holy legate of the sea apostolicke
was letted from beinge present
himselfe, he had wisely appoynted
thē his deputies, whose natures
for their wisedome, whose
personnes for theyr worthinesse,
whose willes by reason of theyr
education, he thought most metest
for this purpose. Wherefore,
he sayd he was able to auouche
this one thing, according to the
truth, & according to y• thoughts
of all that were there presente,
thei were euen ye very same men,



whose religion they all loued,
whose vertues they honoured,
whose good wil, fayth, and aduice,
they all called vpon to the
common sauegard of them all.
For after the time that through
the singular and moste excellent
vertue of the Cardinall Poole,
we had ones in the common
welth begonne out of the misty
darkenesse of the times past, to
behold the clere lyghte agayne,
therwithal began we to fele also
the most greuous euils of our
age: with the which, being vndoubtedlye
both infinite & most
miserable, although we were
before tymes ouerwhelmed, yet
thignoraunce of our calamitye,
was farre greater calamity thā
the calamity it selfe. To the augmentacion
whereof we were in
his iudgement to be compted so



muche y• more miserable, in that
being tossed in so troublesome a
tempest, we perceyued not that
we were ones moued, and that
beinge oppressed wyth so greuous
a malady of the conscience
and of heresye, we felte not our

                  •
                diseased.
            For nedes must that disease be
very daungerous, which wythout
feling of payne wasteth and
consumeth nature, & oftentimes
bringeth men to theyr graues
ere they thinke thē selues sicke.
Wyth suche a kynde of dysease
the vniuersitye was striken.
            For whereas to other affayres
and businesses, it was perchāce
pollitique and witty ynough: yet
in this case of Religion (by reason
the head of the church, from
whence al power of feling commeth,
was maymed) it was become



dul & without perseuerāce:
vntil that about thre yeres past,
the Godly clemency of our most
holy father Iulye the thyrde, hauinge
compassion vppon Englande
almoste starke deade, had
engraffed vs againe into the
Churche, and restored vnto vs
both lyfe and feelynge: By
whose helpe Britayne growing
stronge and lustye agayne, doth
nowe easely vnderstande, howe
it hath escaped the vnauoydable
peril of hell fyre. The whych the
Uniuersitye doth nowe also
clearely see, assuredlye beleuinge
that there was neuer plague
that lyghted vpon anye place,
with the whiche this realme in
this spoyle of religion & schisme,
hath not bene moste miserablye
punyshed and afflycted.
            
               For it were a longe matter to
rehearce, what a noumber of
Monasteryes had bene rased,
what a sorte of Goddes houses
had bene spoyled, what pryestes
had bene murthered, what noble
men had bene put to death,
what commotions and tumultes
had bene raysed by the
Comminaltye, and howe sore
the whole realme had bene empouerished:
the which although
they myghte happen vpon some
other occasion, yet notwythstandynge
for as muche as they
were so greuous that they were
able to oppresse, it was to be
thoughte they were caste vpon
euell persons and offenders, rather
as a punyshement and vengeaunce,
than as a tryall.
            
               But by the way, if these thinges
were graunted to be the dalyance
of fortune, they had abiden
more greuous hurts both of religion
and conscience: as namelye
that the feare of god and reuerēce
of his saintes together wt
theyr altars, were vtterly banished,
the virginal vow of priests
brokē into lust and lecherie, the
mindes of mē cast īto such a dead
slepe, that no Ceremonies were
able to wake them agayne, the
hartes of mē (through variety of
opinions) so diuersly drawen, &
so disagreable wyth thē selues,
that they were wrapped in innumerable
errours. Among the
which there were chiefelye two
welspringes, of whose streames
the vniuersitye confessed it selfe
to haue tasted somewhat more
then ynough, and with the taste



thereof to be well nye dronken.
Whereof the first toke his beginning
of the violēt withdrawing
of our selues from the vnitye of
the catholycke church, a matter
not vnlyke the battell of the mē
               bers
of a mannes body that meneuius
Agrippa rehearced in ataine
ciuile dissention of Citizens:
The latter, of thunmeasurable
lake and filthye puddle of
Wickleue, the whiche the notable
or rather the miserable disputacion
amonge them touchinge
the sacrament of the Altar, opened
and brought to light. As
concerninge the truthe whereof
many being wise in their owne
conceytes, had determined euerye
man according to his owne
ymaginacion: Who folowinge
the philosophers, (but not of the
best sorte) thought theym selues



to haue brought no smal matter
out of the scholes of Epicures, to
the lyght of the Ghospell.
            For those wordes that Chryste
had spoken preciselye, and without
any exception, as cōcerninge
the true and continuall presence
of his body: the verye same they
wrested, yt they iudged Christes
wordes to be maymed & not of
his owne speaking, if this word
(as it were) being proper and peculyar
to Epicures, were not
added thereunto. And whereas
Christen men should say playnly
the body and bloud, they beynge
now Epicures, must say figuratiuelye
as it were the body, & as
it were the bloud. Yet notwithstanding,
forasmuche as it was
no time as then to make manye
wordes of thinges paste, he wished
they mighte ones be condē
               ned



to eternal forgetfulnesse, to
thētent that such as shold come
after, myghte not be infected
with that contagious maladye,
Howbeit they were to be touched
lyghtly, generallye because
that confessyon was wholsome
to such as had erred: perticulerly
bicause the vniuersity beynge
thus wounded by the power &
authority of the maister of manners,
desired by the salues of the
sayd mayster of manners to be
broughte vnto health agayne:
promisynge for her selfe and for
hers to be ruled by discrescion.
            For she had by dayly preaching
alreadye so reduced her Studentes
to repentaunce, that
theyr honours should haue right
good cause to thinke that they
had without dissimulaciō returned
to the wholsom religiō, and



that therein by the diligent conuersacion
of their life presēt, they
would make amendes for their
former misbehauiour. For bothe
suche as were fyrste in this race
proceded moste ernestlye in the
same thynge that they toke vpon
theym with so good willes,
and also such as setting forth later,
came to this gamynge as it
wer in the after noon, did showe
such infallible tokens of thalteracion
of their mindes, that euē
as they rashely and like vnskilful
yonge men fell from the true
religion: euen so they maye seme
not to haue retired out of heresye,
without ripenesse of yeares,
and without stayed iudgement:
all of them delyghtyng more in
the religion newly restored, and
so much longed for, than if they
had continuallye had the vse of



yt and that it had not ben darkened
for a tyme. Wherfore the
vniuersitie humblye & vpon her
knees fyrst & formest besoughte
God of forgeuenesse, desyrynge
him to graunt yt that day might
to be y• preseruaciō of the health
of the sowles of all her inhabytantes,
& to thestablishment of
her publicke weale: And secōdly
she made this peticiō to their honours
for her selfe, for hers, for al
in general, & euery one seueral, yt
vppon the vnfaimed amendmēt
of their lyues they wold vouchsaufe
to pardone thoffences of
times past cōmitted through error
and ignoraūce. And that as
cōcerning al other maters, they
would of their high wisedomes
and singular good will toward
her so determine yt eyther theyr
Iustice might fynd their causes



good, or els theyr clemēcy make
them good. In both whiche doinges,
the benefite shoulde be alike,
whether they iudged thuniuersitye
according to the ryghte
and equity of her case, or for thabundance
of loue absoyled it as
innocent. In recompence wherof,
all that were presente, promised
to vse as muche modestye as
might be in holy matters, to apply
their learning diligently, continually
to embrace and fauour
the true religion, and neuer to
put out of minde the remēbrance
of that good turne.

with a frowninge looke and an

him of his talke: sayinge, he
neded not to repete the thinges
he had protested before, nor they
to make aunswere any more to
those thinges, wherein they had
sufficientlye enfourmed him before.
He rather feared that theyr
quarell was to good, that they
made suche a do aboute it, and
sought such starting holes. For
so were diseased persons oftentimes
wont to do, when for the
paine & griefe they are not able

though that any man were able
to graunt so strong a priuiledge,
as to withstand the Popes authoritye.
As for the byshops letters,
he sayde must nedes make

with him, and could not in any



wise be alledged agaynst him.
Therfore he admonished him to
desyst from his vnprofitable altercatiō,
& to conforme him selfe
and his to such thinges as then
were in doing. After thys they
went to masse, the whiche finished
with great solemnitye, first
they went to the hygh Aultar of

bicause they thoughte it against

those persons, also after muche
altercation, at length (condicionally
that theyr fayth geuen before
to the Colledge were not
empeached thereby) were contented
to be sworne. Three daies
long lasted the inquisition there.
            This was now the third day
of their comminge,The consultacion of the maysters vpon the takyng vp of Bucer. and it was
thoughte that the case of Bucer
and Phagius was delayed longer
than neded. For they looked
to haue had muche altercation
and businesse about the matter.
Nowe forasmuch as the present
estate of the case required good
deliberation, and aduisemēt, the
Uicechauncellour and the maysters
of the Colledges assembled
at the common schooles, where
euerye man gaue his verdite

it was agaynste the rule of the

the open derogation of Goddes

holye lawes, wyth the great perill
of manye mennes soules, and
thoffence of the faythfull, inespecially
in so difficult and contagious

it was not to be suffered,
that they whiche vtterlye dissented

shoulde haue anye parte

And therfore, the glorye of God

pretence to desire this

as who should saye, if he had
not done so, they would neuer

But this glosse was soone
found out. For the Commissioners

in writing before. But peraduenture

mēt made the day before, about
seuen of the clocke in the mornyng.
He had scarce declared the
cause of his comminge, but that
he had not onelye obteyned his
sute, but also euen at the verye
same time, receyued the sentence
of condemnacion and takynge
vp of Bucer and Phagius,
               The sentence of cō
                  demnation copied out by Datarie fayre
copyed out by Ormanet Datarye
him selfe. This was to be confirmed
by the consente of the degrees
of thuniuersitye. Whereupon
a congregation was called
for the same purpose to be at
nyne of the clocke: whē the graduates
were come together, the
demaund was propounded as
concerninge the condemnacion
of Bucer and Phagius, causes
were openly alledged, the verye
same whiche euen nowe we declared
to haue bene alledged by



the maysters of the houses, in
theyr consultacion the daye before:
The degrees layd their heades
togither, & in geuing of their
voices ratified the said sentence.
The which beynge red ouer, request
was made agayne, that
the same myght be signed wyth
theyr cōmon Seale. The which
request was verye lightlye and
easely obtayned. And it was no
maruayle. For nowe after the
death of king Edward, since the
time that the gouernemente of
the realme came to the hande of
Quene Mary, all suche persons
being driuen away as had reiected
the romishe religion (in whō
well nye alonlye rested whatsoeuer
witte and learning was in
the whole Uniuersitye besydes)
such a sort of rascalles were put
in theyr roomes, that all places



nowe swarmed with vnlearned
and vnnurtured chaplaines. To
whō, nothing was greater pleasure,
then to cause al men speake
slaunder and reproche of Bucer.
There were diuers yet leste among
them, that spake agaynst
theyr demaundes. But they (because

according as was determined
the daye before by the generall
consent of the Graduates
of thuniuersitye. And by and by
after, they caried the same to the
Cōmissioners to their lodginge.
The whyche when they had receyued,
forasmuch as after more
diligent perusing therof, it liked
theym not in all poynctes, some
thinges thei rased out, some they
enterlined,The sentence is engrosed new agayne. other some they chaū

so that in fine they wer fain
to take the peyne to engroce it
newe againe.
            About this time almost, one of
the Kinges Colledge, of the nomber
of them that chaunced to be



there at suche time as the Commissioners
tooke a view of thornamentes
of the Church, and of
other thinges that the Pryestes
occupie in theyr ceremonies, hearinge
Ormanet call for the Oyle
wherwyth sycke folke are wont
to be annealed, (the whiche as
it should seme he had neuer sene
before) after his departure, beinge
desirous to see what gere it
was, came to the place: but it
was kepte vnder locke and key.
Thē he enquired wher it stood,
and when he sawe where, he demaunded
to haue a sighte of the
thicke milke wherwithall and a
litle Oyle men were wont to be
annealed. When it was brought
before him, and that he had well
considered it, it was so ranke of
sauour, yt he was fayne to turne
awaye his nose, bidding theym



make ye milke into chese betimes
or els it woulde stinke so that no
man should be able to abide it.
            But ere it was longe after he
bought that word dearely. For
there neuer yet wanted some
Doeg of Edom or other, to bear
word of such thinges to Saule.
For they had theyr spyes in euery
corner whyche euer crepte in

Reade knight, were appoynted
to be done at the Kynges Colledge,
the Commissioners being▪


               
present at the same.
            The Byshoppe of Westchester,
or euer Seruyce was fully done
goinge oute, called to him one of
them that were there, whom he
began to vndermine wyth suche
kinde of talke. It is not vnknowen
to thee (ꝙ he) that the
time drawes nyghe, when Bucers
carcas (according to the decrees
of the Canon law) must be
digged vp: & that which remayneth
of him (to thentent all men
maye take ensample thereby,) be
put to fyre (for so the holye Canons
haue enacted) and the memoriall
of him be vtterly condē
               ned
to obliuion for euer. Nowe
forasmuche as he was buryed
with great pompe & solemnitye,
we thinke it necessarye, that his
burninge be executed with no
lesse solemnitie and furniture.
            
               This assuredly is our meaning
and this toucheth al the degrees
of thuniuersitie. For it is a fowle
shame and not to be borne with,
that so great reuerence shoulde
be done vnto heretiques. Wherfore
it behoueth euery man by al
meanes, to shewe euident tokēs
of thalteracion of his minde.
            And it ought not to be thought
a straunge matter, that this inquisition
is extēded vpon a dead
man. For if so be it that in cases
of hygh treason, it be lawfull to
atteynt a person that is dead, it
standeth with reason, that these
persons beinge more pestiferous
and hurtfull than those that are
giltye of treason, shoulde abyde
like iudgement. When they wer
buried, orations were made before
the degrees of thuniuersity,
and sermons preached to the



people: the like thinge nowe also
when they shalbe burned, do we
purpose to haue. Nowe for bycause
I vnderstande that thou
art an expert oratour, and canst
handle thy selfe wel in that feat,
I would chose thee before all others,
to do the thing, the which
(forasmuch as it shall be greatly
to thy prayse and commendacion)
I knowe thou wilt not refuse
to take vppon the. And for
my part I assure the, I haue the
gladlyer called the hereunto, bicause
I couet they preferment.
            There is but one in all the Uniuersity,
that when he was a yōg
man was my pupill, Nic. Carre
by name, whome for the good
wil I beare him in that respect)
I wil ioine 
                  •
               ellowe with thee in
this matter, to thentente thou
mayst well perceyue therby, that



I commit this charge vnto thee
to do the honour. The man hauing
this his Oraciō in mistrust
answered in this wise. He wyshed
wt all his hart, that ye iudgemēt
as cōcerning this case, shold
be reserued to his betters, saying
that he was not desirous of that
honour: for men would not geue
credit to his wordes, neyther
was he able to deuyse what to
saye against so worthy a person,
(inespecially that might seme to
haue any likelyhod) in yt behalfe.
For he knew not the mannes lyuing
and conuersacion. But as
farre as he could gather bi other
mens talke, he was a mā of such
integritie & purenesse of lyuyng,
that not euen his enemies could
fynde any thyng blame worthye
in him. As for his doctryne, it
passed his power to iudge of it,



howsoeuer he were demed to be
of a corrupt religion, whereof he
was not able to determine, considerynge
it was a doubtfull
Question amonge so great learned
clerkes. But this was manifestlye
apparante, that Bucer
vndoubtedly was a man of singular
knoweledge and dexteritye
of witte: The whych for him
to abase, he thought it an vntollerable
vnshamefastnesse.
            Finallye, for thestimacion of so
weyghty a matter it was requisite
to put some meeter persons
to the defence of it. For neyther
in yeares was he graue & auncient
ynoughe, neyther in witte
prompte nor readye ynough, neither
in eloquence sufficientlye
furnished to take that matter
vppon hym. And if so be it, that



he were able to do anye good he
might serue their turne in an other
matter. The bishop was stil
more earnest vpon him, & when
he sawe it auailed not to vse this
kinde of persuasion with him, he
fell into a rage, and at length bewrayed
him selfe and all his pretence.
For all this earnest entreataunce
was not to haue had him
saye somewhat againste Buc
                     •
                  r,
(albeit it was part of his desyre
as occasion should serue) but to
thentent, that such as he suspected
for re
                  •
               igion, should speake against
them selues. And therfore
he added moreouer, saying: thou
at his buriall didst blaze and set
him out marueylously with epitaphes
and sententious meters,
wherfore nowe also thou shalte
neyther wil nor chose, but speake
in the contrarie parte: and thys



to do, I streyghtlye charge thee
in mine owne name, and in the
name of my felowe Commissioners.
After many wordes, thother
answered, that no mā was
able to shewe anye thinge of his
doing, & if any could be brought
before him, he would condiscend
to satisfye their pleasure: Otherwise
he would not by any meanes
be induced to speake against
him. At length when none of his
writinges coulde be shewed, the
bishop desysted frō his purpose.
            By this time, the sentence of
condemnation was engroced agayne,
to the signinge wherof a
congregation was eftsones called
of all the Graduates of thuniuersitie
agaynst the .xv. of Ianuary.
After it had bene read ouer,
the matter was moued for
setting to of the seale againe (as



we sayd before) the whych was
by and by obteyned. Then the
Graduates were dismissed with
commaundement to resort forth
with to S. Mary churche, whether
the commissioners also repaired.

by the common aduice and
consent of the degrees, he affyrmed
him selfe to haue pronounced
in the open assemblye as the
order of lawe requyred.
            The Commissioners condiscended
to his request, and the nexte
daye processe went oute to cite
thoffendours. Thys Cytacion,
The fyrst Citacion. Uincent of Noally theyr common

In this was specified that who
so euer would mayntaine Bucer

of theyr doctrine, shoulde at the
xviii. daye of the same monethe
stande forth before the .L. Commissioners
in S. Mary church,
which was appoynted the place
of iudgemente, and there euerye
man should be sufficiently heard
what he could saye. This commaundement
was set out with
many wordes. Shortlye after
the matter drew toward iudgement.
Therfore the daye before

xvii. of Ianuary) the Uicechauncellour

            These men cast their heades togither,
howe they mighte beare
witnesse agaynst Bucer & Phagius,
to conuince theym of heresye.
For seinge the matter was
brought in face of open Courte,
and it mighte so come to passe
they myght fynde Patrones of
theyr case, they thoughte it nedefull
to haue witnesses to depose
of theyr doctrine: What came of
this theyr consultacion, it is not
perfectly knowen.
            The Commissioners (for they
were maruaylous conscionable



mē in al their doings) had great
regardeThe regard that the inquisitours had of the charges of the Colledges. of thexpenses of euerye
Colledge wher thei should make
inquisition. Wherefore to the entent
that none of theym shoulde
stretche theyr liberalitye beyond
measure, or aboue theyr power,
they gaue charge at the begynnyng,
that ther should not in any
place be prepared for their repast
aboue three kindes of meate at
the most. The lyke order the cardinall
him selfe, in a certaine prouinciall
Synod appoynted in
his dyetes a litle before to all his
pryestes and Chaplaynes.
            Therfore, when thei came to the
Kinges Colledge the .xviii. daye
to sitte vpon enquirye, and that
one Capon chaunced to be serued
to the Table more thā was
prescribed by thorder taken, they
thrust it awaye in great displea-sure.



These thriuinge men that were
so sore moued for the preparyng
of one Capon, within litle more
then one moneth, beside their
priuate refections, wasted in
theyr dayly dyet wel nye an hundred

            The very same daye the Uicechauncellour
going to the inquisitours
(they were as I told you
at the Kinges Colledge) did put
them in remembraunce, that the
same was the daye in whyche
by their processe sente forthe the
xvi. daye, they had commaunded
to appeare in S. Mary Church,



such as would take vpon theym
to defend Bucer and Phagius,
in the lawe. He desired therfore
that they would vouchsafe to sit
there, if perchaunce anye man
woulde trye thaduenture of the
lawe. They lightlye condiscended
thereunto. When the Uycechauncellour
accordinge to his
dutye had brought them thither,
he exhibited vnto theym the processe
of Citacion that he had receyued
of them to publyshe a litell

of Bucer & Phagius. The .xxii.
day of the same moneth was limited
to this Iurye to brynge in
theyr verdit.
            In the meane while Ormanet
and VVatson, abode at home
in their lodginge, to take the depositions
of thē, whom we shewed
you before, to haue ben called
to Peterhouse, and to haue
communicated with the Uycechauncellour



as concerning that
matter. whose depositions (as I
told you) neuer came to lighte.
The bishop of Westchester, and
Cole, this daye visited theym of
Catherin hall, wher (as farre as
I coulde learne) nothinge was
done worthy of rehersall.
            ☞ As Ormanet was sittinge at
Trinitie Colledge,A relique geuen by Ormanet to Trinitie Colledge. Iohn Dale,
one of y• Queenes colledge came
to him, whom he had commaunded
before, to bring with him the
pixe, wherein ye bishop of Romes
god of bread is wonte to be enclosed.
For Ormanet told thē he
had a precious Iewel, (the same
was a linnē clout that the Pope
had cōsecrated wt his own hāds)
which he promised to bestow vp
on thē for a gifte. But Dale mysvnderstāding
Ormanet, in stede
of ye Pixe, brought a chalyce & a
singīg cake (called the hoste) the



which he had wrapped vp & put
in his bosome. When he was
come, Ormanet spake him courteouslye,
demaundinge if he had
brought him the thinge he sente
him for: to whō he aunswered he
had brought it: thē geue it me (ꝙ
he) Dale pulled out the chalyce &
the singing cake. Whē Ormanet
sawe that, he stepped somewhat
back as it had ben in a wonder,
calling him blockhead, & litel better
thē a mad man, demaunding
what he ment by those thinges,
saying, he willed hī to bring none
of that gere, & that he was vnworthy
to enioy so hygh a benefite,
yet notwithstanding forasmuch
as he had promised before
to geue it theym he would perfourme
his promyse. Whereupon,
wyth great reuerence and
Ceremonye, he pulled oute the



the linnen clothe and layed it in
the chalyce, and the bread wyth
it: commaunding theym both for
theholinesse of the thing, and also
for thautour of it, to kepe it
among them wyth suche due reuerence
as belonged to so holy a
rellique.
            About this time almoste, the
Commissioners gaue commaundemente
to the maysters of the
Colledges,A commaū
                  dement for bringing in of heretical Bookes. yt euerye man should
put in writinge what bookes he
had, with the authours names.
And to thentent that euery man
should execute it without deceit,
they tooke a corporall othe of
them. For they sayde it was not
lawefull for anye man to haue,
reade, or copye out those vngodly
bookes of wicked heretiques,
writtē against the reuerent sect
of the catholiques, & the decrees



of the most holy Canons. Therfore
they should diligently serche
them out, to thentent they might
be openly burnt. They sayd they
gaue theym warninge of these
thinges, whych they oughte not
to loke for: for these things ought
rather to haue bene done of theyr
owne free will, then extorted by
force. The whych thing, not only
the Canons cōmaunded, but also
the most noble and worthy Emperours
Theodosius and Ualentinian,
made in certayne places
decrees as concerning the wrytinges
of heretiques, and especiallye
agaynst the bookes of Nestorius.
This commaundemente
some executed exactlye and diligently,
othersome, forasmuch as
they demed it wrongefull, executed
it slackly ynough.
            We declared before, that the



xviii. day was the daye of iudgement.
When the day came, and
that neyther they whyche were
cited, appeared in the Court, nor
that anye put forthe him selfe to
defend them, yet the Commissioners
wold not procede to iudgement,
whyche neuerthelesse, for
theyr contumacye in absentynge
theym selues they myghte haue
done,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                considering howe that day
was peremptory.The second Citacion. But these men
being bente altogyther to equitie
and mercye, had rather shew
some fauour, then to do thuttermost
they myght by the lawe.
            Whereupon Uincent published
the seconde processe, and set it vp
in the same places, that the former
was. The meanyng thereof
varied not much from the fyrste,
but that it put of the iudgemente
daye vnto the .xxvi. of the same



moneth. The whych daye they
sent for the Uicechauncellour to
theyr lodging, and there agreed
with him as concerning thorder
of publishing the sentence: whom
(for bicause ther should want no
solemnitie in the matter) they cō
               maūded
to warne the Maior of
the towne to be there at the day
appointed with al his burgesses,
the whych thing the Uicechauncellour
did wyth al speede.
            While these thinges were a
working agaynst Bucer & Phagius▪
in the meane whyle they
forslowed not to make Inquisition
in some places as the matter
requyred. Therefore,Inquisition at Clare hall. when
as almoste the same tyme they
came into Clare hall, & entered
into the Chappell, (whiche was
their ordinarie custom to do first
of all whersoeuer they became)



they perceyued there was no sacrament
(as they cal it) hanging
o
                  •
               er the altar. The which thing
being taken in great displeasure,
Ormanet calling to him the maister
of the house, tolde him what
a great wyckednesse he had by
so doing, brought vpon him selfe
and all his house. For although
he were so vnwyse to thinke it
no shame at all, yet vnto them it
seemed an inexpiable offence.
            The old man being amased, and
lookinge aboute him howe he
myghte aunswere the matter,
while he went about to pourge
him selfe thereof, made the faulte
double: He sayde it was a prophane
place, neuer as yet hallowed
nor consecrated with anye
Ceremonies, At that worde, the
Commissioners were yet more
astonied, demaunding whether



he him selfe or anye other had vsed
to synge masse there or no.
            When he had cōfessed that both
he him selfe, and others also, h
                  •
               d
oftentimes said masse there:
            O thou wretched olde mā (quod
Ormanet) thou haste cast bothe
thy selfe and them in daunger of
the greuous sentence of Excommunication.
Ormanet, being sore
moued at the beginning, serched
the man narowly: howe manye
benefices he had, wher they lay,
by whose fauoure or licence he
helde so many at ones, what excuse
he had to be so farre, and so
long from them▪ for as it shoulde
seme he spente the most parte of
the yeare in thuniuersitie, farre
from the charge that he had taken
vpō him. Swineborne was
so sore astonied at this so sodaine
disquietenesse of Ormanet, that



being more disquieted him selfe,
he was not able to answere one
worde, neyther to these thinges,
nor to anye other thinges appertayning
to thestate of his house.
Wherfore one of the fellowes of
the house, that was senior to all
y• rest, was faine to take vpō him
the maisters turne in y• businesse.
            This was now the .xxii. day,
whiche I tolde you was limited
to the iury,The witnesses are sworne not to publyshe their depositions. Yong, Segiswyke▪ &c
to geue vp their verdit. Who neuerthelesse
during the tyme that
thinquisitours sate in S. Marie
churche, neyther appeared that
day nor put vp any thing openly
against them that were accused.
Whether thei obiected any thing
secretly agaynste theym or no▪ I
am not able to saye. For by lyke
othe they were exhibited to publishe
theyr depositions, as they



were bound to beare witnesse.
            In this Session nothing was
done, sauing that the Uicechancellour
restored agayne the processe
for appearance, that he had
receyued of theym two dayes agone:
The tenor wherof, he sayd
he had published vpon the contumacie
of thē that were cited, according
as they had cōmaunded
him. Whereupon he requested
them to appoint the .iiii. day next
folowinge to pronounce the sentence
of condemnatiō: the which
wythoute anye difficultye he obteyned.The iudgement day i
                     •
                   appoynted.
For I shewed you before,
that so it was agreed among
them selues. And yet these
bluddy butchers wold for al that

               ke and merciful men.
            Insomuche that they would
seeme to determine nothynge of
theyr owne heades, before that



this moste filthye executioner of
other mens wycked lustes, had
earnestly sewed to theim for the
same. As though no man had
bene able to espye oute their colourable
conueyance, or as if we
had cast from vs both our myndes
and eies, that we should neither
vnderstande, nor see theyr
craftye packyng. Euen so, they
setting a fayre glosse vpō al their
doinges, sought to brynge them
selues in credite with men, to
thentent that when oportunitye
should serue, they might to theyr
owne most aduauntage, deceiue
men vnwares. Surelye, they
might not in anye wise seeme to
do those thynges, whyche they
were most chiefelye bente vpon
and therfore they sought al meanes
possible to bieare mens eies,
that they should not see theym,



but they coulde not so escape vnespyed.
            About this time they sent out
a cōmaundement that the mayster
of euerye Colledge by thaduice
of his house,A cōmaundement for makinge of an Inuentorye of the goodes of euery Colledge, as wel mouable as vnmouable. should cause to
be put in writinge, howe muche
euery house had of ready mony,
how much of yearely reuenewe,
howe much thereof had bene bestowed
about necessarye vses of
the Colledge, howe much went
to the stipendes of the fellowes,
and the daylye diet of the house,
howe much was allowed for other
extraordinarie expences,
how much remayned from yere
to yeare, what was done with
y• ouerplus, with a due accompt
of all thinges belonginge to that
purpose. The whiche thinge (because
that for the straungenesse
and noueltye thereof, it shoulde



not make men to muse & breake
theyr branes about it) they sayd,
that before theym the Colledges
of Eton and Winchester had
done the like. The cause whye
they coueted to be certifyed here
in, was for none other purpose,
but to thentent that they theym
selues myghte see, whether that
they, to whose charge the custodye
and administration of those
goodes was committed, hadde
behaued theym selues so truelye
and faythfullye, as by theyr othe
they were bounde to do. This
pretence made these diligent and
curyous stewardes of other
mens goods. But it was knowen
well ynoughe, that thys was
rather a fayned allegacion, than
a true tale. For it was their
minde, to searche what power



the Clergy was of, the whyche,
forasmuche as they made an assured
accompte of, to haue willing
to take theyr partes which
were the chiefe heades of thys
businesse, they coueted to knowe
before hand, and to put theym in
a readines, agaynst all hasardes
and aduentures of Fortune.
            And no man oughte to surmyse,
that this coniecture is vayne, or
that it dependeth vpon a lyghte
ground, considering what a dele
of armoure, what a dele of artillerye
and furniture for the warres,
the whole bodye of the Clergye,
but inespecially the prelates,
(who at that time bare all the
sway) had layed vp in store at
home in theyr owne houses, or
els put in custodye of theyr confederates.
            
               The whiche, forasmuch as they
coulde be construed to tende to
none other purpose then to open
force (inespecially in so cankerd
a tyme as that was) is it not a
good likelihode that to the same
enten
                  •

should be made of the strengthe
of thuniuersitye, which it selfe to
thuttermoste of her power, was
readye to susteyne anye daunger
or burden, for the maintenaunce
of that filthy supersticion? But
God hath looked mercifully vpon
vs, and pulled theyr swordes
from our neckes. But nowe let

            ¶Nowe was come the daye of
iudgemente,The day of the iudgement and all the degrees
of thuniuersitye were assembled
to se this pageant. Thither came
also the Maior and his townesmen,



and all met together in S.
Marie Churche to beholde and
learne what should be determined
vpon these men by the Commissioners.
After longe attendaunce
of the multitude, at lēgth
the Commissioners came forthe,
and went vp to a scaffolde that
was somewhat higher then the
residue, prepared for ye same purpose.
When they had taken theyr
places, there Perne the Uicechauncellour,
the player of thys
enterlude, fashioninge his countenaunce
with greate grauitye,
reached to them the processe that
was lastly publyshed to cite thē:
sayinge these wordes. I brynge
forthe agayne (quod he) to you
ryght reuerende fathers & Commissioners
of the most reuerend
my L. Cardinall Poole (payntinge
out the rest of his stile) this



Citacion executed accordynge to
the purporte and effecte of the
same: Omittyng nothyng for his
parte that myghte make to the
commendacion of this matter.
When he had thus fynyshed hys
tale, by & by the byshop of Westchester,
after he had a litle viewed
the people, began in manner
in this wise.
            Ye see (ꝙ he) howe sore thuniuersitye
preaseth vpon vs, how
earnest intercession it maketh
vnto vs,Westchesters oraciō before the pronouncīg of the sentence of condemnacion. not onelye to denounce
Bucer and Phagius (whych these
certayne yeares past, haue spred
most pernicious doctrine among
you) Heretiques, as they bee indede:
but also that we will commaunde
theyr deade Carcases,
(whych vnto this daye haue obtayned
honourable buryall among



you) to be dygged vp and
(as it is excellentlye ordayned by
the Canon lawe) to be cast into
fyre, or what soeuer is more greuous
then fyre if any can be.
            For the degrees of thuniuersitye
deale not slyghtlye nor slackelye
wyth vs in this case, but do so
prease vpon vs, and folowe the
sute so earnestly, that they scarce
geue vs any respyte of delay.
            And I assure ye, albeit this case
of it selfe be suche, as that euen
thunworthinesse of those persons
(thoughe there were no further
cause) oughte to induce vs to the
doyng thereof, muche the rather
(moued wyth these so wholsome
peticions) it is meete and conuenient
we should graunt it. For
howsoeuer we of our selues are
enclined to mercy in our hartes,
(then the which we protest there



is nothinge vnder the sonne to
vs more dere and acceptable) yet
notwithstanding, the very lawe
riseth vp to reuengemēt, so that
the common saluation of you al (
which ye law prouideth for) must
be preferred before the priuate
charitie of our mindes. And it is
not to be committed, that beyng
scarce yet escaped oute of ye shipwracke
of our former faulte and
calamitye, we should suffer thys
vnexpiable mischiefe, to disquiet
any lenger the cōsciences of the
weake. Moreouer, it is but reason
that we shold do somewhat
at so earnest entreatance & sute
of thuniuersitye. It nedeth not
speake much of our selues. For if
we had bene desirous to enterprise
this matter, it had ben lawfull
after the firste Citacion, to
haue proceded to iudgemente:



But for bicause we were willing
that their defendours should be
heard, and that the matter shuld
be tried by lawe, we sent out the
second processe. If we had desyred
reuengemente, we mighte
haue shewed cruelty vpon them
that are aliue: of the which (alas
the more pitye) there are to many
that embrace this doctryne.
If we thirsted for bloude, it was
not to be sought ī withered carcases
and drye bones. Therfore
ye may wel perceyue, it was no
part of our willes that we now
came hither: but partlye induced
at thentreatāce of thuniuersity,
partly moued with thunworthinesse
of the case it selfe, but inespecially
for the care and regard
we haue of your health and saluation,
the whyche we couet by
all meanes to preserue whole



a
                  •
               d sound. For you your selues
are the cause of this businesse:
you gaue occasion of this confession,
among whom thys day
ought to be a notable example,
to remayne as a memoryall to
them that shall come after: as in
the whyche ye maye learne, not
onely to shake of the fylth which
ye haue taken of these persons,
but also to beware hereafter,
that ye fall no more so shamefully
as ye haue done: But I
trust God will defende you, and
geue ye mindes to kepe youre
selues from it. as concerninge
them, whose case nowe hangeth
in lawe, they bare about the
name of the ghospell, whereas
in dede they wrought nothynge
els than theuery and deceyt.
            And so much the wickeder wer
they, in that they soughte to couer



so shamefull actes, with the
cloke of so fayre and holy a name
Wherefore it is not to be doubted
but that God will punyshe
this despyght of it selfe wycked,
to you pernicious, by thautours
thereof shamefull and abhominable.
But if God (as he is slow
to wrathe and vengeance) wyll
wynke at it for a tyme: yet notwithstanding,
if we (vpon whō
the charge of the Lordes 
                  •
               locke
leaneth) should permit so execrable
crymes escape vnpunished,
we should not lyue in quiete one
houre.
            When he had thus spoken, he
recited the sentence oute of a
scroll, and condemned Bucer &
Phagius of heresye,the cond

their bodies to be digged
out of theyr graues, & being disgraded
from holy orders, deliue



red them into the handes of the
secular power. For it was not
lawfull for such innocent persōs
as they were, abhorring from al
bloudshed, and detesting all desire
of murder, to put anye man
to death.Th

                  ulnesse of thuniuersitye. O vnworthye and abhominable
act: for which thuniuersitye
shall neuer be able to
make satisfaction. Now vnworthye
a thing was it, to do all the
spyghte that myghte be to hym
beyng dead, to whō being aliue
she exhibited al thonour & reuerence
she could deuise. Now vntolerable
a thīg was it, to detest
and abhorre him as a wycked

in his life time she had folowed

and obeysau
                  •
               ce, as her maister
and chyefe guide of her life?



What a monstruous thing is it
not to spare him when he was
dead? who during his life being
aged and alwayes sickelye, yet
neuer spared him selfe, to thentent
he myght profyte them?
            Nothinge greued him more, all
the time he laye sicke & bedered,
than that he was vnprofitable
both to them and to the churche
of God: and yet whē he was deceased,
he neyther founde obedience
among his disciples, nor buriall
amonge Christen men. If
manhode and reason coulde not
haue obteyned so muche at our
handes, as to spare his memoriall,
or to reuerence his ashes, yet
nature and the common law of
all nations (by the whiche vpon
promise made by the body of the
realme he came hyther) ought to
haue withheld this so great crueltie



and extreame barbarousnesse
or sauagenesse from his bones.

gotten,Pernes sermō against Bucer. Andrewe Perne the

For after that Scotte had
pronounced the sentēce, he made
a Sermon before the people, takynge
that place of the, 132.
Psalm, Beholde, howe good and
pleasaunte a thynge it i
                     •
                  . &c. For
his theme to enreate vpon:
where beginning with the commendacion
of concorde, and of
the mutuall kni
                  •
               tinge together
of the mindes, he alledged that
it was not possible to holde togither,
onelesse the concord were
deriued oute of the heade, (the
whyche he made to be the Byshoppe
of Rome) and that it also



rested in the same. When he had
made a longe protestacion vpon
this place, he passed frō it to Bucer,
vpon whō he made suche a
shamefull raylinge, that it is not
possible to diffame a man more
thā he did: saying, yt his doctrine
gaue occasion of diuision in the
common welth, & that ther was
not so greuous a mischief, which
by his meanes hadde not, bene
brought into ye realm. Although
all men myght perceyue by such
bookes as he had cōpyled, what
maner of doctryne it was: Yet
notwithstānding he said he knew
it more perfectly him selfe thā any
did,What thinges Perne accused Bucer of. & that he had learned it a
part at thautours hand himselfe
For at such time as they had cō
               munication
secretelye amonge
them selues, he sayd that Bucer
woulde oftentimes wyshe he
myghte be called by some other



name, than by the name he had:
the whyche he did for this purpose,
as though, knowinge hym
selfe giltie of so greuous a crime,
he might by this meanes escape
vnknowen to the world, and auoide
the talke that went amōg
men of him. Moreouer amonge
other thinges, he tolde how Bucer
held opinion, (whych thinge
he shoulde confesse to hym hys
owne selfe) that God was the
authour and welspring, not onelye
of good, but also of euell: and
that whatsoeuer was of that
sorte, flowed from him as from
the head spryng and maker ther
of. The whyche doctrine he vphelde
to be sincere: how be it for
offendinge diuers▪ mens consciences,
he durste not put it into
mennes heades. Manye other
thinges he patched together, of



like purport and effect, as of the
supremacie of ye bishop of Rome,
of the maryage of pryestes, of diuorcementes,
and of shamefull
vsurie also, as though he had demed
theym lawfull to be vsed among
Christen people, wyth diuers
other of the same sorte. In
all whych his allegations, consideringe
howe lewdly wythout
all shame he lyed vppon Bucer,
(as his writinges euidently declare)
he did not so much hinder
his name with rayling vpō him,
as winne vnto him selfe an inexpiable
infamie, by forgynge so
shamefull leasinges vpō so worthye
a man. But what needeth
witnesse to proue him a lyar?Pernes opinion of Bucer according to his cōsciēce his
owne conscience shall make as
much agaynst him as a number
of men. It was reported for a
truthe, (and his owne familyar



frendes were the bringers vp
thereof) that he him selfe (eyther
immediately after his sermō, or
els somewhat before he went to
it) striking himselfe on the brest,
and in maner wepinge, wished
at home at his house wyth all
hys hearte, that God woulde
graunte his soule myghte euen
then presentlye departe and remayne
wyth Bucers. For he
knewe well ynough that his life
was suche, that if anye mannes
soule were worthye of heauen
he thought his inespecially to be
most worthye. Whiles he was
thus talking to the people, in the
meane time the leaues of the
church dores were couered ouer
with verses: in the whiche the

the whyche Sermon he spake
muche reproche of Bucer and

He sayde that these men and all
the heretiques of oure time that
were of the same opinion (the
which for the most part he sayde
had budded out of Germany) among
other thinges which they
had perniciouslye put into mens
heades, taught to cast away all
ceremonies. Whereas notwithstanding

               maunded
all thinges to be done
in due order. And vpō that dede
of the blessed virgin and Ioseph
whiche was done by thē as vpō
that day it was manifestly apparant,
that they with our sauiour
being then a litle babe, obserued
these rites & Ceremonies, for catholike

that they came to the Temple

in theyr handes, after the maner
of procession (as they terme it) in
good order with much reuerēce
and deuotion: and yet we were
not ashamed to laugh and mock
at these things wt the heretiques
& Schismatikes. As he was telling
his tale of Christ, Marye, &

him, a pleasaaut & mery conceyted

he had bene out of his wittes.
Some thoughte it came vpon
this occasiō, that bicause he had
bene greatlye accused before the
Commissioners for mispending
and misordring the goods of the
colledge, he was so greued with
the matter, inasmuche as he
knew they were displeased with
him, by that that Ormanet had

hower and more, ere he coulde

of Bucer & Phagius. when
he had persued these letters, he



poūded the matter to y• degrees
of thuniuersitie, whether it pleasen
theym, that the degrees and
titles of honoure taken awaye
from Martin Bucer and Paulus
Phagius, by ye verdit of the
whole vniuersitye should by the
same be fullye restored againe: &
that al actes done against them
& their doctrine should be repealed
and disanulled. The whych
demaundes wer openly consented
vnto by al the Graduates of
thuniuersitye. This was about
the .xxii. daye of Iuly, in the yere
of our lord. 1560. Albeit that
this had bene sufficiente to restore
them lawfully againe: Neuerthelesse,
forasmuch as it seemed
not ynoughe in consideracion
of the dignitye of so worthye
men, and in satysfaction
of the duety of the Uniuersitye▪


               
they that were the chiefe doers
in this matter, called a congregation
in S Mary Churche, at
the last daye of the same moneth
sauing one. In the whyche place
consultacion was had concerninge
Bucer and Phagius, not
with so great furniture and gloriousnesse
(whiche thinges the
truth seketh not gredely for) but
wyth honest comlinesse to thentent
to reconcile mens hartes agayne.
An oration was made
by Acworth the common Oratour
of thuniuersity,The oration of Acworth oratour of thuniuersitye at the restitution of Bucer and Phagius. whose wordes
I will rehearce in order as
he spake them.
            ☞ I am in doubt whether I
maye entreate of the prayse and
commendacion of so greate a
clerke (for the celebrating wherof
this assemblye and concourse
of youres is made this daye) or



of the vices and calamityes, out
of the which we be newely deliuered:
or of them both: consydering
thone can not be mentioned
withoute thother. In the
whych times ye felt so much anguishe
and sorow (my right dere
brethren) that if I should repeat
them and bring them to remembraunce
agayne, I feare me, I
should not so much worke a iust
hatred in vs towards them, for
thiniuryes receyued in them, as
renew our olde sorow and heauinesse.
Againe, men must nedes
accompt me vnaduised and foolishe
in my doinge, if I shoulde
thynke my selfe able, to make
him whyche hathe liued before
your eyes in prayse and estimation,
more famous and notable
by my Oration, which he by his
liuing
                  •
                and conuersacion hath



oftētimes polished. But the wickednesse
of ye times which ende
               
                  •
               ored
to wipe cleane out of the
remēbraunce of men, the name yt
was so famous & renoumed in
euery mannes mouth, did much
profite hī. In so much that both
in his life time all thing redounded
to his cōtinuall renowne, &
inespecially after his decease nothing
could be deuised more honourable,
then wt so solemne furniture
and ceremonies to haue
gone about, to haue hurte ye memoriall
of such a worthy man, &
yet could not bringe to passe the
thinge that was 
                  •
               o sore coueted:
but rather brought that thynge
to passe, whiche was chiefelye
sought to be auoyded. For the desire
that men haue of the dead,
hath purchased to many meneuerlasting
fame, & hath not takē


               
awaye immortalitye, but rather
amplifyed & increased the same.
By meanes wherof it commeth
to passe, that he yt wil entreat of
those thinges, that pertayne to
the prayse of Bucer after hys
death: can not choose but speake
of the crabbednesse of the times
past, vpon the whiche ryseth a
greate increase and augmentation
of his prayse. But his 
                  •
               yfe
is so excellently set forth, not onlye
by the writinges of the learned
clerkes Cheke and Carre,
and by the liuelye voyce of the
right famous. D. Haddon vttered
in this place to the great admiration
of all the hearers,
when his bodye should be layed
into his graue to be buried, and
after hys buryall by the godlye
and moste holye preachynges of
the ryghte reuerende father in



Chryst Tharchbyshop of Caunterbury
that nowe is, and of D.
Readman: the which for ye worthinesse
and excellency of them,
oughte to sticke longer in oure
myndes vnwrytten, then many
thynges that are penned & put
in prynt: but also by the great assemble
of all the degrees of thuniuersitye
the same day: in bryngynge
him to his graue, and the
next daye after by thindustrye of
euerye man that was endewed
with anye knoweledge in the
Greeke or Latine tounges: of
the whiche, there was no man,
but that set vp some Uerses, as
witnesses of his iust and vnfained
sorowe, vpon the walles of
the church: That neyther at that
time anye reuerence or duetye
whych is due to the dead departinge
oute of this life, was then



duers
                  •
               ipped, or nowe remayneth
vndone that maye seeme to partayne
eyther to the celebratyng
of the memoriall of so holy or famous
a person, or to the consecratinge
of him to euerlastinge
memorye. We at that time sawe
wyth our eyes this Uniuersitye
flouryshinge by his institucions:
the loue of sincere religion not
onelye engendered, but also confirmed
& strengthened through
his continuall and daylye preachinge. In so much that at suche
time as he was sodaynly taken
from vs, there was scarce anye
man that for sorowe could finde
in his hearte to beare with the
presente estate of thys lyfe, but
that eyther he wyshed with all
his heart to departe oute of thys
lyfe with Bucer into another,
and by dieng to folowe him into



to immortalitye, or els endeuored
him selfe with wepinge and
sighing to call him againe, being
dispatched of all troubles into ye
prison of this bodye, oute of the
which he is escaped: lest he shold
leaue vs as it were standinge in
battel ray without a captaine, &
he hī selfe as one casshed depart
with his wages, or as one dyscharged
out of ye campe, wtdraw
him selfe to the euerlasting quietnesse
& tranquility of the soule
Therfore al men euidently declared
at that time both howe sore
they tooke his death to hearte,
and also, how hardly they could
away with the misture of such a
man. As long as the ardent loue
of his religion (wherwt we wer
inflamed) flourished, it wrought
in our hartes an incredible desire
of his presence amorvs.
            
               But after the time yt the godlye
mā ceased to be any more in our
sight and in our eyes, ye ardent &
burning loue of religion by litle
& litle waxed cold in our mindes
& according to the times yt came
after (which were both miserable
& to our vtter vndoing) it began
not by litle & litle to be darkened,
but it altogither vanished
away and turned into nothing.
For we fel againe into the troublesomnesse
of the popishe doctrine:
the old rites & customes of
the romishe churche were restored
againe, not the garnishment
& beatifiyng of the Christen religion
(as they surmised) but to
thutter defacing, violating, and
defiling of the same: Death was
sette before the eyes of suche as
perseuered in the christē doctrine
that they had learned before:
            
               They were banished the relame
that could not apply them selues
to the time, and do as other men
did: such as remained, were enforced
eyther to dissemble, or to
hide theym selues and crepe into
corners, or els by drinkinge as it
wer of ye charmed cup of Circes,
to be turned and altered, not
onelye from the nature of man
into the nature of brute beastes,
but (that farre worse and much
more monstruous is) from the
likenesse of God and his Aungels
into the likenesse of deuels.
And all England was infected
with this maladye. But I wold
to God the corruption of those
tymes whyche ouerwhelmed all
the whole realme, had not at
least wise yet perced euery parte
& member thereof. Of the which
there was not one but that (besides



the griefe that it felte with
the residew of the bodye, by reason
of the sickenesse and contagion
spred into the whole) had
some sorowe and calamitye peculiarly
by it selfe. And to omit
the rest (of the which to entreat
this place is not appoynted, nor
the time requireth oughte to be
spoken) this dwellinge place of
the Muses (which we cal thuniuersity)
may be a sufficient witnesse,
what we may iudge of all
the rest of the bodye. For certesse
my brethren, the thinge is not to
be dissembled that can not be
hidden. We applying our selues
to those most filthy times, haue
moste shamefullye yelded lyke
fayntharted cowardes, whyche
had not the stomacks to susteyn
thaduersities of pouerty, banishment,
and death: Which in oure



liuing & conuersacion, kept neyther
the constancie taughte vs
vs by Philosophye, nor yet the
patience taught vs by holy scripture:
whych haue done all thinges
at the commaundement of
others. And therfore that which
the Poete (althoughe in another
sence) hath trimly spoken maye
well de thoughte to haue bene
truly prophecied vpon vs.
            The times and seasons changed be
            And changed in the same are we.
            Diuers of them that were of
a pure & sincere iudgemēt as cō
               cerning
religion being driuē frō
hence & distroubled, the rest that
remayned tasted and felte of the
inhumanitie of theym in whose
handes thautoritie of doing thinges
here consisted. Although to
say ye truth, I haue vsed a gētler
terme thā behoued. For it is not



to be accōpted inhumanitye, but
rather immanitie & beastly crueltye:
the which, when they had
spent al kindes of torments and
punishementes vpon the quyck:
when they had cruelly taken frō
such as cōstantly perseuered, life,
from others riches, honors, and
all hope of promotion, yet coulde
not be so satisfyed, but that incensed
& stirred with a greater
fury, it began to outrage euen against
the dead. Therfore wheras
in euerye singular place, was
executed a singuler kinde of crueltie:
insomuch that there was
no kinde of cruelnesse that could
be deuised, but it was put in vre
in one place or other) This was
proper & peculiar to Cambridge,
to exercise the crueltye vppon
the dead, whiche in other places



was extended but to the quicke.
Oxford burnt vp the right reuerend
fathers Cranmer, Ridley,
and Latimer, the noble witnesses
of the clere lyght of the ghospel.
Moreouer at London peryshed
these two lāternes of light,
Rogers and Bradford: In whō
it is hard to saye whether there
were more force of eloquēce and
vtterance in preachinge, or more
holinesse of life and conuersaciō.
Many other without noumber
both here and in other places
were consumed to ashes for bearing
recorde of the truthe. For
what citie is there that hath not
flamed, I say not with burning
of houses and buyldinges, but
with burning of holy bodies?
            But Cambridge, after ther wer
no mo left aliue vpon whō they
myght spue out theyr bitter poison,



playde the madde bedlem
agaynst the dead. The dead mē,
whose liuinge no man was able
to finde faulte with, whose doctrine
no man was able to reproue,
wer by false & slaūderous
accusers indited, contrary to the
lawes of God and man sewed
in the law, condemned, their sepulchres
violated & broken vp,
theyr car
                  •
               ases pulled oute and
burnt wyth fyre. A thing surelye
incredible if we had not seene it
with our eyes, and a thyng that
hath not lyghtlye bene heard of.
But the haynousnesse of thys
wycked act, was spredde abrode
as a commō talke in euery mans
mouthe, and was blowen & disp
                  •
               rsed
through all christendome.
Bucer by thexcellēcye of his wit
and doctrine knowen to al men
of oure countreymen in maner



craued, of manye others intreated
and sente for, to thentent he
might instructe our Cambrydge
men in the sincere doctryne of
the Chrysten religion, being spēt
with age, and his strengthe vtterlye
decayed, forsoke his owne
countreye, refused not the tedyousnesse
of the lōg iourney, was
not afrayed to aduenture hym
selfe vpon the sea, but had more
regarde of the dilating and amplifyeng
of the church of Chryst,
than of all other thinges. So in
conclusion he came, euerye man
receyued and welcomed him, afterward
he liued in suche wyse,
as it might appere he came not
hither for his owne sake, but for
oures. For he sought not to driue
away the syckenesse that he had
taken by the troublesome trauayle
of his longe iourney, and



albeit his strength were weakened
and apalled, yet he regarded
not the recouerye of his
healthe, but put him selfe to immoderate
labour and intollerable
paine only to teache and instructe
vs. And yet toward this
so noble & worthy a persō while
he liued were shewed all the tokens
of humanitie & gentlenesse
reuerence and courtesie, y• coulde
be, and when he was deade, the
most horrible cruelty and spight
that might be ymagined. For
what can be so common, as to
graunte vnto the liuinge house
and abidinge place, and to the
deade buriall? Or what is he
that will finde in his harte to
geue enterteinment and to cherishe
that person in hys house
wyth all kinde of gentlenesse
that he 
                  •
               an deuise, vpon whom
he coulde not vouchesafe 
                  •
               o



to bestowe buryall when he is
dead? Agayne, what an inconstancye
is it, with great solemnitie,
and with much aduauncement
and commendacion of his
vertues, to burye a man honorablye,
and anon after to break vp
his tombe and pul him out spitefully?
and wrongfullye to slaunder
him beynge deade, who duryng
his lyfe tyme alway deserued
praise? Al these thinges haue
happened vnto Bucer, who
whyles he lyued had free accesse
into the moste gorgeous buyldings
and stately palaces of the
greatest Princes, and when he
was dead could not be suffered
to enioye so much as his poore
graue. Who being layd into the
grounde noblye to his eternall
fame, was afterward to his vtter
defacing, spitefully taken vp



and burned. The whych things
albeit they did no harme to the
dead (for the dead carcases feele
no paine, neyther doth the fame
of godly persons depende vpon
the report of vulgar people, and
the lyghte rumours of men, but
vpon the ryghtefull censure and
iust iudgement of God) yet it reproueth
an extreame crue
                  •
               nesse
and vnsaciable desire of reuēgement,
in them whych offer suche
vtter wrong to the dead. These
persons therfore, whō they haue
pulled oute of theyr graues and
burned, I beleue (if they had ben
aliue) they would haue cast out
of house and home, they woulde
haue driuen out of al mens company,
and in thende wyth moste
cruell tormētes haue torne them
in pieces, being neuerthelesse alientes,
being straungers, & being



fetched hither by vs, out of suche
a countrey, wherethey not onely
neded not to feare anye punishement,
but contrary wise wer alwaies
had in much reputacion,
as well amonge the noble & honorable,
as also among the vulgar
& common people. But yet
howe muche more gentle than
these men, was Byshop Gardener?
otherwise an earnest defendour
of the popyshe doctryne?
Who agaynste his owne countreymen
let passe no crueltye,
whereby he mighte extinguyshe
wyth fyre and sword the lyghte
of the Ghospell: and yet he spared
forreyners, because the
ryghte of theym is so holye, that
there was neuer nation so barbarous,
that woulde violate the
same. For when he had in hys
power the renoumed clerke Peter



Martyr, then teachynge at
Oxforde, he would not kepe him
to punishe him, but (as I haue
heard reported) when he should
go his way, he gaue him wherewith
to beare his charges. So
that the thing which he thought
he myghte of ryghte do to his
owne countreymen, he iudged
vnlawfull to do to straungers.
And whom the lawe of God
could not withhold frō the wicked
murtheringe of his owne
countreymen, him did the lawe
of man bridle from killynge of
straungers: the which hath euer
appeased all barbarous beastlynesse,
and mitigated al crueltye.
For it is a poynte of humanitye
for man & man to mete together
& one to come to another though
they be neuer so far separated &
set a sūder both by sea & by land,



without the which accesse there
can be no entercourse of merchaundy
se, there can be no conference
of wittes, whyche fyrste
of all engendered learninge, nor
any commoditye of society long
to continue. To repulse thē that
come to vs, and to prohibite thē
our countreyes, is a poynt of inhumanitie:
Now, to entreat thē
euil, that by our sufferance dwel
amongest vs, and haue encrease
of household & household stuffe,
it is a poynt of wickednesse.
            Wherefore this crueltye hathe
farre surmounted the crueltie of
all others, the whyche, to satisfye
the vnsaciable greedinesse therof,
drewe to execution, not only
straungers broughte hither at
our entreatance and sēding for,
but euen the wythered and rotten
carcases digged out of theyr



graues: to thentente that thun
measurable thurst which coulde
not be quenched wyth sheading
the bloude of theym that were
alyue, myght at the least be satisfyed
in burning of dead mennes
bones. These (my brethren) these
I say, are the iust causes which
haue so sore prouoked the wrath
of God against vs. Bicause that
in doing extreame iniurie to the
deade, we haue bene prone and
readye: but in puttinge the same
away, we haue bene slowe and
slacke. For verelye I beleue (if I
may haue libertye to say freely
what I thynke) ye shal beare wt 
me (if I chauce to cast forth any
thing vnaduisedlye in the heate
and hasty discourse of my oration)
that euen this place, in the
whiche we haue so oftentimes
assembled, beyng defyled wyth



that newe kinde of wickednesse
suche as man neuer heard of before,
is a let & hinderaunce vnto
vs, when we call for the helpe of
god, by meanes wherof our praiers
are not accepted, whych we
make to appease the godhead, &
to winne him to be fauorable to
vs againe. The bloude of Abell
shed by Cain, calleth & crieth frō
yt earth yt sucked it vp: lykewise,
thundeserued burninge of these
bodyes, calleth vppon God almighty
to punishe vs, and crieth
that not onelye thautoures of so
great a wickednesse, but also the
ministers therof are vnpure, the
places defiled in whiche these
thinges wer perpetrated, thaire
infected which we take into our
bodyes, to thentent that by sundrye
diseases and sickenesse we
maye receyue punishement for so



execrable wickednesse. Looke
wel about ye (my dere brethren)
and consider with youre selues
the euelles that are past: and ye
shal se howe they tooke their beginning
at Bucers death, following
one in anothers necke euē
vnto this day. Fyrst and formost
when we were euen in the chiefest
of our mornīg, & scarcely yet
recomforted of our sorow for his
death, the sweatinge sickenesse
lyghted vpon vs, the which passing
swiftly through al Englād,
and as it wer in hast dispatched
an innumerable company of mē
secondlye, thuntimelye death of
our most noble kinge Edwarde
the syxth, (whose life in vertue
surmounted thopinion of al men
and seemed worthy of immortality)
happened contrary to mens
expectacion in that age, in the
vnlesse violence be vsed, fewe



do dye. The conuersion of religion,
or rather the euersion & turning
therof into papistrie. The
incursion & domination of straū
               gers,
vnder whose yoke our neckes
were almost subdued. The
importunate crueltye of the byshoppes
agaynst the Christians
which executed that wickednes
for making satisfaction wherof,
we ar gathered together thys
day. These are the thinges that
ensued after his death: but after
his burninge ensewed yet greuouser
thinges. Namelye newe
kinde of plagues, and contagious
diseases, vnknowen to the
very Phisitians, whereby either
euery mans health was appayred,
or els they were brought to
theyr graues, or els very hardly
recouered: blouddy battels with
out victorye, whereof the profite



redounded to the enemie, and to
vs ye slaughter with great losse.
The which thinges do euidentlye
declare, that God is tourned
from vs, and angrye with vs,
and that he geueth no eare to
our prayers, and that he is not
moued wyth our cries & sighes,
but that he loketh, that this our
meting and assembly should be
to this ende: that forasmuche as
we haue violated theyr coarses,
we should do thē ryght againe:
so that the memoriall of these
most holy men, may be commended
to posteritie vnhurted and
vndiffamed. Wherfore amende
yet at length (my brethren) whiche
hitherto by reason of the variablenesse
and vnconstancye of
the times, haue bene wauering
and vnstedfast in your heartes:
shewe your selues chearefull



and forwarde in making satysfaction
for thiniurye you haue
done to the dead, whom wyth
so greate wickednesse of late ye
endomaged and defiled: not by
sensinge thē with the parfumes
of those odours and spices now
worne out of vre & put to flight
but with a true and vnfayned
repentance of the hart and with
praier: to thentent that the heauenly
godhead, prouoked by our
doinges to be our enemye, may
by our humble submission be entreated
to be fauorable & agreable
to all our other requestes.
            When Acworth had made an

                  •
               nd of his Oration, M. Iames
PilkingtonThe sermon of D. Iames Pilkingtō
                the Quenes reader
of the diuinitye lecture, goynge
vp into the pulpit, made a Sermon
vpō ye .C.xi. Psalme, the beginning
whereof is. Blessed is



the man that feareth the lord. &c
Where intending to proue that
the remembraunce of the iust
man shall not peryshe, and that
Bucer is blessed, and that the
vngodly shal freat at the syghte
thereof, but yet that all their attemptes
shall be to no purpose,
to thentent this sayinge may be
verified: I will curse your blessinges,
and blesse your cursings,
he tooke his beginninge of hys
owne person, that albeit he wer
both ready and willinge to take
that matter in hand, partlye for
the worthinesse of the matter it
selfe, and inespecially for certain
singular vertues, of those persons,
for whom that congregation
was called, yet notwithstandinge
he sayde he was nothing
meete to take that charge
vpon hym.
            
               For it were more reason that he
whiche before had done Bucer
wrong, should nowe make hym
amendes for the displeasure.
            As for his owne parte, he was
so farre from workynge anye
euell agaynste Bucer, eyther in
worde or dede, that for their singular
knowledge almoste in all
kinde of learninge, he embraced
both him and Phagius with all
his heart. But yet he somewhat
more fauoured Bucer, as with
whom he had more familiarity
and acquaintaunce. In consideracion
wherof, although that
it was scarce conueniente, that
he at that time shoulde speake,
yet notwithstandinge he was
contented for frendeshippe and
courtesye sake, not to 
                  •
               ayle them
in this theyr businesse. Hauynge
made this preface he entered into



the pith of the matter, wherein
he blamed greatlye that barbarous
crueltye of the Courte of
Rome, so fierslye extended against
the dead. He sayd it was
a more heinous matter thē was
to be borne wyth, to haue shewed
such extreame cruelnesse to
them that were aliue, but for anye
man to misbehaue him selfe
in suche wise toward the deade,
was suche a thinge as had not
lightly bene heard of. Sauynge
that he affirmed this custome of
excommunicating and cursynge
of dead folks, to haue come first
from Rome. For Euagrius reporteth
in his writinges, that
Eutichius was of the same opinion,
induced by thexample of
Iosias, who slewe the priestes
of Baall, and burnte vp the bones
of theym that were deade,



euen vpon thaltars. Whereas,
before the time of Eutichius this
kinde of punishement was wel
nere vnknowen, neyther afterward
vsurped of any man (that
euer he hearde of) vntill a nyne
hundred yeares after Christ.
            In the latter times (the whyche
how much the further they wer
from that golden age of thapostels,
so much the more they wer
corrupted) this kinde of cruelnesse
beganne to creepe further.
For it is manifestlye knowen,
that Stephen the sixth Pope of
Rome, digged vp Formosus his
last predecessour in that sea, and
spoyling him of his Popes apparayle,

For taking vp his deade
bodye and setting it in a Popes
chayre, he caused his heade to be
smiten of, and his other thre fingers
to be cut from his hande,
and his body to be cast into the
ryuer of Tiber, abrogating and
disanulling all 
                  〈◊〉
                decrees, whiche
thing was neuer done by any
man before yt day. The cause
why so great cruelty was exercised
(by the report of Nauclerꝰ)
was this: bycause that Formosus
had bene an aduersarye 
                  〈◊〉
               
Stephē & Sergius when they
sued to be made bishoppes.
            
               This kinde of crueltye vnheard
of before, the Popes a while exercised
one agaynst another.
            But nowe, or euer they had sufficientlye
felte the smart thereof
thē selues, they had 
                  •
               ourned the
same vpō our neckes. Wherfore
it is to be wished, that seinge
it began among them, it myght
haue remayned still with thautours
therof, and not haue bene
spred ouer thence vnto vs. But
such was the nature of all euell,
that it quickly passeth into example,
for others to do the like.

lyke maner digged vp, & burnte

William Tracye of Gloucester,



a man a of worshipful house
bicause he had writtē in his last
will that he should be saued only
by faith in Iesus Christe, and
that there neded not the helpe of
anye man thereto, whether he
were in heauen or in earth, and
therfore bequeathed no legacye
to that purpose as all other men
were accustomed to doe. This
dede was done sithens we may
remember aboute the .xxii. yeare
of the raygne of Henry the .viii.
the yeare of our Lorde. 1530.
            Nowe seing they extended such
crueltie to the deade, he sayde it
was an easye matter to coniecture
what they would do to the
liuing. Wherof we had sufficiēt
triall by the examples of oure
owne men, these fewe yeares
past. And if we woulde take the
paynes to peruse thynges done



somwhat lenger ago, we might
fynde notable matters oute of
our owne Chronicles. Howbeit,
it was sufficiente for the manifest
demonstration of that
matter, to declare the beastlye
butcherye of the Frenche kyng,
executed vpon the Waldenses,
at Cabryer, and the places nere
thereabout, by his captaine Miner,
about the yeare of our lorde
1545. than the whiche there
was neuer thinge read of more
cruellye done, no not euen of the
barbarous Paganes. And yet
for all that when diuers hadde
shewed theyr vttermost cruelty:
both agaynste these and manye
others, they were so farre from
theyr purpose in extinguishynge
the lyght of the ghospell, whych
they endeuored to suppresse, that
it increased dayly more & more.



The which thing Charles the .v
(than whom all christendome
had not a more prudent prince,
nor the church of Christ almoste
a sorer enemy) easely parceiued,
and therfore when he had in his
hand Luther dead, & Melācthō
and Pomeran, wyth certayne
other preachers of the Ghospell
aliue, he not onelye determined
not any thing extremely against
theym, nor violated theyr graues,
but also entreatinge theym
gently sente them awaye, not so
much as ones forbidding thē to
publishe openly ye doctrine yt they
professed. For it is the nature of
Chrystes Church, that the more
that Tyrauntes spurne against
it, the more it encreaseth and
flourysheth. A notable proofe
assuredly, of the prouidence and
pleasure of God in sowynge the



the Ghospell, was that cōminge
of the Bohemians vnto vs, to
thentente to heare Wycklyfe, of
whom we spake before, who at
that time reade openlye at Oxforde:
and also the going of our
men to the sayde Bohemians,
when persecution was raysed
agaynst vs. But much more notable
was it, that we had seene
come to passe in these our daies:
that the Spaniardes sent for in
to this realme of purpose to suppresse
the Ghospell, as soone as
they were retourned home, replenyshed
many partes of theyr
Countreye, with the same truth
of religion, to the whych before,
they were vtter enemyes. By
the whyche examples, it myghte
euidently be perceyued, that the
Princes of this world labour in
vayne to ouerthrowe it, consideringe



howe the mercye of God
hath sowen it abrode, not onely
in those countreyes yt we spake
of, but also in Fraunce, Poole,
Scotlande, and almoste all the
rest of Europe. For it is sayde,
that some partes of Italye, (althoughe
it be vnder the Popes
nose) yet do they of late enclyne
to the knowledge of the heauē
               ly
truth: Wherfore sufficient argument
and profe myght be taken
by the successe and encreasement
thereof, to make vs beleue
that this doctryne is sent vs frō
heauen, vnlesse we will wilfully
be blynded. And if there were
anye that desired to be perswaded
more at large in the matter,
he myght aduisedly consider the
viage that themperour and the
Pope with bothe theyr powers
togither, made ioyntly agaynst



that was reported of their captayne
zisca: who when he shold
die, willed his body to be flaine,
and of his skin to make a parch
ment to couer the heades of a
drom. For it shold come to passe,
that when his ennemies hearde
the sounde of it, they should not
be able to stand against them.
            The like counsell (he sayde) he
hym selfe nowe gaue theym as
concerning Bucer. That like as
the Bohemians did with y• skin
of zisca, the same should they do
with the argumentes and doctrine
of Bucer. For as soone as
the Papistes shoulde heare the
noyse of him, their gewgawes
should forth with decay. For sauinge
that they vsed violence to
such as withstoode theym, theyr
doctrine cōtayned nothing that
myghte seeme to anye man (hauing



but meane vnderstanding
in holy scripture) to be groūded
vpon anye reason. As for those
thinges yt were done by them against
such as could not play the
madmē as well as they, some of
them fauored of open force, and
some of ridiculous foolishenes.
For what was this firste of all?
was it not friuolous? that by ye
space of three yeares togyther,
masse shoulde be songe in those
places wher Bucer & Phagius
rested in the lorde without anye
offence at al? and assone as they
tooke it to be an offence, streight
waye to be an offence if anye
were heard ther
                  •
                or that it shold
not be as good thē as it was before?
as if y• then vpon y• sodaine
it had bene a haynous matter
to celebrate it in that place



& that the faulte that was past,
should be counted the gr
                  ••
               ouser
bicause it was done of lenger
time before. Morouer, this was
a matter of none effect, that Bucer
and Phagius only should be
digged vp, as who should saye,
that they alonly had embraced
the religiō which they cal heresy
It was wel knowen howe one
of the Burgesses of the towne
had bene minded toward ye popishe
religiō. Who whē he shold
dye,Fanne sometyme Maior of the towne. willed neither ringinge of
Belles▪ Diriges, nor anye other
suche kinde of trifles to be done
for him in his anniuersarye as
they terme it, but rather yt they
should go with instrumentes of
musyke before the Maior & coū
               sell
of the Citye, to celebrate his
memoriall, and also that yearely
a sermon should be made to the



people, bequeathinge a peece of
monie to the preacher for his labour.
Neither myght he omit in
that place to speak of Ward the
peinter, who albeit he wer a mā
of no reputaciō, yet was he not
to be dispised for the religiō sake
which he diligently folowed.
            Neither were diuers other mo
to be passed ouer wt silence, who
were knowen of a certaintye to
haue continued in the same sect,
& to rest in other churcheyardes
in Cambridge, & rather through
the whole realme, & yet defyled
not their masses at al. Al y• whiche
persons▪ (forasmuch as they
were al of one opinion) ought al
to haue ben takē vp, or els all to
haue bene let lye with the same
religiō: onles a man wold graūt
y• it lieth in their power to make
what they list lawfull & vnlaw-



at theyr owne pleasure. In the
condemnacion of Bucer and
Phagius (to saye the truthe)
they vsed to much crueltye and
to muche violence. For howesoeuer
it went with the doctryne
of Bucer, certainlye they coulde
fynde nothing wherof to accuse
Phagius, in as muche as he
wrate nothing yt came abroode
sauing a fewe thinges that he
had translated oute of the Hebrewe
and Chaldye tounges,
into Latyn. After his comming
into the realme, he neuer read,
he neuer disputed, he neuer preached,
he neuer teached. For he
deceased so sone after, yt he could
in that time geue no occasiō for
his aduersaries to take hold on,
whereby to accuse him whom
they neuer heard speak. In that
they hated Bucer so deadly, for



thallowable mariage of the clergye,
it was their owne malyce
conceyued agaynst him, & a very
slaunder raised by thē selues.
For he had for his defēce in that
matter, (ouer and besides other
helpes) the testimonie of Pope
Pius the seconde, who in a certayne
place saieth, yt vpō weighty
consideratiōs priestes wiues
were taken from theym, but for
more weyghtye causes were to
be restored againe. And also the
statute of the Emperour, they
call it the Interim, by the which
it is enacted, that such of ye clergie
as were maryed should not
be diuorced from theyr wiues.
Thus turning his stile frō this
matter, to thuniuersitie, he reproued
in fewe words their vnfaithfulnesse
towards these mē.
For if the lorde suffered not the



bones of y• king of Edom, being
a wicked mā, to be takē vp and
brent wtout reuēgemēt (as saieth
Amos)Amos ca. 2 let vs assure oure selues
he will not suffer so notable a
wronge done to his godly preachers,
vnreuenged. Afterward
whē he came to ye condemnaciō
(which we told you in ye former
actiō was pronoūced by Perne
the Uicechancellor in the name
of thē al) being somewhat more
moued at the matter, he admonished
them how much it stood
thē in hand, to vse great circumspectnesse,
what they decreed
vpon any mā by their voyces in
admitting or reiecting any man
to the promotions & degrees of
thuniuersity. For yt which should
take his authoritie frō thē shold
be a great preiudice to al thother
multitude, which (for thopinion



y• it had of their doctrine, iudgement,
allowance, & knowledge)
did thinke nothinge but well of
them. For it wuld come to passe,
that if they would bestow their
promocions vpō none but meete
persons, & let the vnmeete go as
they come, both the cōmō welth
should receiue much commodity
& profite by them, & besides that
they should highlye please God.
But if they persisted to be negligēt
in doing therof, they shold
greuouslye endomage the common
weal, and worthely worke
theyr owne shame and reproch:
ouer and besides that they shold
greatlye offende the maiestye of
God, whose commaundemente
not to beare false witnesse, they
should in so doynge breake and
violate.
            In the meane while that he



was speaking these and many
other things before his audiēce,
many of thuniuersitye to set out
and defend Bucer withal, beset
the walles of the Churche and
Churchporche on both sydes wt 
verses, some in Latin, some in
Gra
                  •
               ke, & some in Englyshe, in
the whiche they m
                  •
               de a manyfest
declaration how they were
minded both towarde Bucer &
Phagius. Finally when his sermon
was ended they made cō
               mon
supplication and praiers.
After thankes rendered to god
for many other thinges, but inespecially
for restoring of the
true and sincere religion
euery man departed
his waye.
