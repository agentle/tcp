                  TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, Sr. FOVLKE GREVILL Knight, Chancelor of his Highneſſe Court of Exchequer, and one of his Maieſties moſt Honourable Priuie Councell: the aſſurance of Gods loue in all outward bleſings of this life, with the vndoubted euidence of Gods Spirit, for the fruition of Heauen and happineſſe in the life to come, be daily more and more increaſed and confirmed, through Ieſus Chriſt, &c.
                  
                  
                     Right Honourable:
                  
                  
                     SVch is the force of Vertue, and of the very ſhadow of Godlineſſe, that (as it were) naturally it draweth mens loue and affection, and after a ſpeciall manner vniteth mindes together, farre diſtant, and different in calling and condition. The very Heathen hauing experience hereof, both by their writing confeſſed, and alſo practiſed the ſame one towards another; who for the loue of morall vertues embraced thoſe whom they neuer ſaw. How much more then ſhould Gods Children, rightly informed by Gods Word, and reformed by his Spirit, moſt highly value the incomparable worth of ſincere Religion, and the holy profeſſion thereof, by the meanes and miniſtery whereof, men

are (as it were) newly created, and reſtored to the Image of the eternall God, which maketh them moſt amiable in the ſight of God, and honourable in the account of his children,1 Iohn 3.14. who doe know that they are tranſlated from death to life, by louing the brethren? For as God, in himſelfe the very fountaine of all goodneſſe,1 Iohn 4.16. is loue, and properly to be loued of all, being the very obiect and ſubiect of all Chriſtian affection, as hauing in himſelfe all the cauſes both motiue and attractiue to draw them vnto him: So they whoſoeuer of Gods elect, which moſt reſemble him in grace and goodneſſe, doe next deſerue our loue; not that we ſhould diuide the ſame from God (the very Ocean of goodneſſe) but rather to make it knowne that we truly loue the Lord our God in them, who cannot poſſibly loue God whom wee haue not ſeene,1 Iohn 4.20. except wee loue his Children which repreſent his perſon, and in whom hee will proue our loue towards himſelfe. Hence ariſe ſo many good occaſions to make Gods children acquainted, which (otherwiſe) would be ſtrangers; & many poore Chriſtians and deſpiſed Miniſters in the world, to write and ſpeake, ſeeke and ſue, for the countenance and acquaintance of eminent perſonages, ſincerely profeſſing and patronizing Gods truth;
                        Luke 1.3. and with Luke, to looke for ſome noble Theophilus;2 Iohn 1. and with S. Iohn, ſome honourable and Elect Lady, vnto whom they may conſecrate their labours.
                  The conſideration of which premiſes (Honourable Sir) may ſomewhat qualifie my preſent boldneſſe, in this my ſeeming raſh attempt. Neyther is it ſtrange (indeede) that poore men in the valley, looke to the Beacon on the hill, and that ſuch ſpreading fruitfull trees ſhould be in view,
                        Dan. 4.17.18.19 and knowne for ſhelter and reliefe againſt a ſtorme. Hee which ſeeketh fonſuch friends, ſeeketh to God his aſſignes: for are they not his Deputies, to doe good to his Church and Children?
                        Iob 29.13.15.16 Are they not eyes to the blinde, and feet to the lame? Are they not fathers to the poore, and in ſo being, procure their bleſſing? I minde not here to blaze out your iuſtly deſerued praiſes, but rather in dutie be earneſt

in my prayers to God, for the increaſe and continuance of Gods graces beſtowed vpon your Honour, for the good of our Church and Common-wealth: And (I hope) you haue learned, that continuance in well-doing, getteth the greateſt praiſe and prize with God, and all good men: And my particular prayer ſhall be, that ſtill you may exceede your ſelfe, in the performance of all Chriſtian duties, to God, our Prince, and Countrey; euer tending to that perfection which leadeth to eternall life. Moreouer, let your Honour be throughly perſwaded, that God will haue all his children humbled here, before they can aſpire to the top of the higheſt glory (which they hope for) hereafter; and that the way hereunto is rightly to know our ſelues by our fraile condition and mortall eſtate. May it pleaſe you therefore (with other ſorts and rancks of Gods people) to take ſome view thereof in this Diſcourſe: Feare not (Honourable Sir) to read ſome lines thereof at your leaſure, the receipt whereof (I doubt not) will proue more wholſome then toothſome to the fleſh, which ſtill would make vs play the Gyants againſt our God; yet mortified it muſt be in ſome meaſure: For as raw fleſh is not fit for the ſtomacke; no more are vnmortified men for God. Euen Nichodemus himſelfe muſt be borne againe,
                        Iohn 3.3. if he will come to an aſſured hope of that heauenly inheritance.
                  I preſcribe here no Lawes nor Rules to be obſerued, with the Franciſcans, Dominicks, and other Fryers, to this or that ſect or ſort of men;
                        Heb. 9.27. I ſay (with the Apoſtle) There is one Law for all men
                     ▪ enacted in heauen, without repeale, that they muſt dye: And for as much as God hath ſanctified this Phyſicke for the ſaluation of our ſoules, let the wholeſomneſſe thereof qualifie the bitterneſſe: And ſince the death of the faithfull hath loſt her ſting in Chriſt his death, let vs neuer feare the humbing of this Bee, nor being able to hurt vs. But for theſe Cordials of Comfort, with many moe ſoueraigne Antidotes againſt Deaths poyſon and dangerous Symptomes, I leaue your Honour to a larger diſcourſe thereof in the proper place.
                  
                     Now for offering to your Honour ſuch mournfull matter of humiliation, and as it may ſeeme diſtaſtfull to Courtly ſenſes; let theſe few words ſuffice. That as there is a communitie of fleſh and bloud, and a generall infection of ſin in all Adams heires, that ſo likewiſe Death (which is the wages thereof) is, and muſt needes be common vnto all, without exception of any: And ſo long as the godly and wicked liue together in this world, euen ſo long there is betweene them a certaine equalitie in the fleſh, though alwayes an euident diſtinction in the ſpirit: So that vntill this mortall body hath put on immortalitie,1 Cor. 15.53. and the ſpirit of Chriſt,
                        Rom. 8.9. which dwelleth in Gods children, hath brought them to God in heauen, all diſcommodities and caſualties, with Death it ſelfe, muſt needs be incident to all men alike. Beſides that, our earthly proſperitie ſo dulleth our ſpirituall ſenſes, and our great imployments in the world, ſo carry away our affections, and ſo hinder the remembrance of our latter end, that the greateſt men (many times) both for place and gifts, doe mightily forget themſelues herein: and knowing it to be ſo, haue had their ſpeciall Memorandums. I omit to ſpeake of the preparing of their Sepulchres in their life time, and the purpoſed placing of them in their common walkes, with their ſet ſalutations of ſome ſeruant to that purpoſe.
                  Thus moſt humbly ſupplicating your Honour to be well pleaſed with this my honeſt purpoſe, and chriſtian indeuour, in the fauourable acceptance thereof; I commend your Honour to the gracious protection and direction of the eternall and euer liuing God, who euer guide you with his ſpirit, in all your weighty imployments, to his glory, and the good of his Church, &c.
                  From my poore Study at Shearſbie, in Leiceſterſhire. February 21. 1616.
                  
                     Your Honours in all Chriſtian duties, wholy deuoted in the Lord Ieſus, IOHN MOORE.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  AN ABRIDGEMENT OF THE WHOLE Bookes ſubſtance: OR A GENERALL TABLE of the principall poynts thereof, according to the CHAPTERS and SECTIONS.

                           CHAP. I.
                           
                              GOD in his incomprehenſible Wiſedome, Goodneſſe, and Loue, created man at the firſt, as a Chryſtall glaſſe of his glory, and a liuely reſemblance (in a ſort) of his Maieſtie.
                           
                              Section 1.
                           
                           Mans body a briefe map and abridgement of the whole worlds perfection.
                           
                              2.
                           
                           Mans excellency and maieſtie in his firſt Creation.
                           
                              ibid.
                           
                           Man in his body reſembled his Maker, and in his ſeuerall members expreſſed the varietie of his perfections.
                           
                              4.
                           
                           The very Pagans admired the portraiture of mans body, and preferred it before the worlds curious creation.
                           
                              ibid.
                           
                           Man eſpecially in his ſoule reſembled God: with the manner how.
                           
                              5.
                           
                           
                              Gods Image in man appeared eſpecially in the regiment of the creatures.
                           
                              6.
                           
                           It conſiſteth principally in righteouſneſſe, holineſſe and knowledge.
                           
                              ibid.
                           
                           The Image of God in man, is to haue the ſame Will, Knowledge, Iudgement, and Reaſon, with God, in humane and heauenly things in a meaſure: with the reaſon thereof.
                           
                              7.
                           
                           The difference betwixt the Image and Similitude of a thing.
                           
                              8.
                           
                           Chriſt is the very ingrauen forme of God, and the true patterne and type of our firſt created image.
                           
                              ibid.
                           
                           Reaſon and Will (as two wings to the Soule) did at the firſt guide it aright to God, that ſo it might ſoare aloft with her affections, to heauen and heauenly things.
                           
                              9.

                              10.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           CHAP. II.
                           GOD alone is vnchangeable, and all creatures haue their being, ſtanding, and vpholding by him who onely is.
                           
                              Sect. 1.
                           
                           Gods name and nature.

                              Adam was mortall by creation, yet had he not ſinned, he neuer had dyed.
                           
                              2.
                           
                           Man was made of a mutable nature, in power of ſtanding, and poſſibilitie of falling.
                           
                              3.
                           
                           The reaſon why God alone is vnchangeably good, and all other creatures ſubiect to decline.
                           
                              ibid.
                           
                           Three things requiſite for Adam, and the Angels, to perſeuere in goodneſſe.
                           
                              4.
                           
                           Why the good Angels fell not, but keepe ſtill their ſtanding.
                           
                              ibid.
                           
                           
                              Adam (if hee would) had grace ſufficient to haue kept himſelfe from ſinne and death, illuſtrated by examples.
                           
                              5 & 6.
                           
                           
                              Adam could fall of himſelfe, but hee could not ſtand or riſe againe: with the vſe thereof.
                           
                              7.
                           
                           Why man was made of a changeable nature.
                           
                              8.
                           
                           Man was ſubiect to death by nature, but not of neceſſitie: with the reaſon.

                              Adam by yeelding procured his fall, and ſo ſold himſelfe to Sinne and Sathan, to the iuſt deſtruction of himſelfe, and all his ſeede.

                           Chriſts power is made perfect through our weakneſſe: he is all things to vs, which are nothing in our ſelues.

                           Chriſt is not onely God with his Elect in nature, but in perſon; the reprobate are of the ſame nature with him, yet he is not God with them, but againſt them.

                        OVr moſt gracious God, infinite in 
                           section 1 wiſedome, and incomprehenſible in loue towards mankinde, hauing before all worlds decreed to make himſelfe moſt glorious in his Creation, did in his appointed time effect the ſame. For hauing made the world in wonderfull manner, and furniſhed it with all varietie of creatures, both for profit and pleaſure, deuiſing in his wiſedome and vnſpeakable loue, a perfection of happineſſe for man vpon the earth; at laſt,Gen. 1.26. after a moſt exquiſite manner conſulted with himſelfe for the ſhape of man, and finding no creature fit enough for a patterne of his portraiture, concluded with himſelfe to make mankinde, as a Chryſtall glaſſe of his glory, and a moſt liuely reſemblance, after a ſort, of his Maieſtie.
                     
                        
                        
                           section 2 And that not onely in the frame of his body, to be as it were a briefe Map and abridgement of the whole worlds perfection, which hee made as a moſt glorious Theatre, fully repleniſhed with moſt admirable ſights of all ſorts: but (which is more) both in body and ſoule to repreſent his Creator, as his Vicegerent and petty Monarch on the earth, and ſeating him here as it were in his Throne, and putting his owne Scepter into his hand, and his Crowne of glory vpon his head, gaue him dominion and rule ouer all the workes of his hands; ſo that well may the Prophet with wonder exclaime and cry out:Pſal. 8.4. 
                        Lord, what is man that thou art ſo mindefull of him? &c.
                     
                     
                        
                           section 3 Now that this Image of God was liuely expreſſed in whole man (reſembling his Maker both in his body, and in his ſoule) doth plainly appeare by the renuing of man in Chriſt,Rom. 12.1.2. 2 Cor. 7.1. who is not onely ſanctified in the one alone, but in the other.
                     
                        
                           section 4 And firſt for mans Body: it did reſemble God in that immortalitie wherein it was firſt created, as alſo in the ſeuerall members thereof, expreſſed the varietie of his perfections, and therefore (in reſpect of Gods diuers employments) in a borrowed ſpeech are aſcribed to him, as the hands and armes,Gen. 49.24. Exod. 6.6. Pſal. 31.3. & 34.16. & 114.7. Iob 19.21. Eſay 66.2. Pſal. 8.6. &c. to ſhew Gods omnipotencie and power; his eyes and eares, his piercing prouidence and ſight, &c. I omit mans face and comely countenance (in which principally doth ſhine a certaine imperious maieſtie and grace moſt conſpicuous) cauſing all liuing creatures to ſtoupe vnto him; and beſides the goodly order of all his outward parts (ſet and diſpoſed in admirable ſort) a glorious beauty ſpreading it ſelfe throughout, with wonderfull ſtrength, agillitie, and nimbleneſſe of all his members, made him moſt famous: that very Naturaliſts and Pagans anatomizing his very body, not onely preferred the frame thereof before the worlds whole curious creation but (rauiſhed in their ſenſes with the conſideration of the ſame) deified and preferred it aboue all meaſure.
                     
                        
                           section 5 Yet as waxe is more apt to receiue an impreſſion then

clay: ſo the ſoule, being a Spirit, commeth neareſt to Gods nature. For firſt, the very ſubſtance of Adams ſoule did moſt liuely ſhadow out the diuine Eſſence, not onely in the ſimplicitie, inuiſibleneſſe and immortalitie thereof, but alſo in that power which it enioyed, to know and will. And as God is but one in the world, quickning, ſuſtaining, and gouerning the ſame; ſo there is but one ſoule in the body, which (being whole in euery part thereof without augmentation or diminution) giueth vnto it both life, ſenſe, and motion. Further, the ſoule is like vnto God in the faculties of the ſame: For as there is but one onely diuine Eſſence in the Godhead, and yet three diſtinct perſons in reſpect of their externall actions: ſo the ſoule is but one, howſoeuer it conſiſteth of ſundry eſſentiall qualities.
                     This Image of God in man conſiſted eſpecially in the 
                           section 6 rule and dominion of the Creatures.Gen. 1.26. 
                        Let vs make man (ſaith God) in our owne image, that hee may rule the fowles of the ayre, fiſh of the ſea, beaſts of the earth. Now to rule well, is required Knowledge, Memorie, Will, Vnderſtanding and Iudgement; which are eſſentiall in God, and proper to our ſoules. Man had not onely giuen vnto him of God power and abilitie to vnderſtand diuine and humane things, but was endued with other heauenly qualities, as Iuſtice, Wiſedome, Temperance, Mercy, Loue, &c. Gods Image in man is righteouſneſſe, holineſſe and knowledge. Be renued (ſaith the Apoſtle) in the ſpirit of your minde,
                        Ephe. 4.23.24. 
                        and put on the new man, which after the Image of God is created vnto righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe. Whoſe qualities are neceſſarily inferred by the contrary, attributed to the olde man: where truth is oppoſed againſt lying, Chriſtian anger againſt ſinfull rage, iuſt dealing againſt falſhood and wrong, holy and gracious ſpeech againſt corrupt and filthy communication. And hee ſaith, that this Image or new man is renued in knowledge after the image of him that created it; becauſe the true knowledge of God tranſformeth man to the image of God his Maker,Col. 3.10. 2 Cor. 3.18. that is to

ſay, to the true ſinceritie and pureneſſe of the ſoule▪ Therefore preſently following hee expreſſeth the qualities of this Image;Col. 3.12.13. to wit, tender affection, or bowels of compaſſion, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of minde, meekneſſe, long-ſuffering, forbearing, and forgiuing one another, Loue, Peace: and theſe be the fruits of Gods Spirit, which renueth our hearts, (as they are muſtred by S. Paul) againſt which vertues (hee ſaith) there is no Law:Gal. 5.22.23. 
                        Rom. 8.29. which Image alſo is called, a conformitie to Gods Sonne.
                     
                        
                           section 7 By the infuſion of Gods holy Spirit (ſaith Iraeneus) man is made ſpirituall,
                           Irenaeus lib. 5. as at the firſt hee was created. And Tertullian ſaith, that the Image of God in man, is to haue the ſame ſenſe and motion with God,
                           Tertul. contra Marcion.
                         the ſame Will, Knowledge, Affection, Iudgement, and Reaſon, in all humane and heauenly things, according to the meaſure of a creature. The reaſon thus to perſwade vs, is, that man was made firſt according to Gods Image, that hee might rule all his creatures below as his Preſident and Subſtitute ouer all. And it is no queſtion, but God would haue all his creatures (which hee had made) well and orderly to be ouer-heeded and ruled, (who alwayes and euery where in his Word) forbiddeth the abuſe of any, or the leaſt: and wee are ſtraightly bound to referre all of them to the glory and praiſe of their author and owner. Now this good vſe and excellent adminiſtration of all the creatures, which God requireth, cannot ſtand without all thoſe former conditions and qualities of the ſoule of man, whereof this Image of God conſiſteth. So that when the minde is endued with the ſound knowledge of God, and adorned with Iuſtice; then it moſt truely repreſenteth Gods Image and likeneſſe▪ becauſe that Iuſtice and knowledge of diuine and heauenly things are nothing elſe but a certaine influence from the diuine nature into our mindes and ſoules.
                     
                        
                           section 8 But that theſe things may appeare more plainly, wee are to know, that the Image of a thing is the forme by which it is reſembled, and a ſimilitude is a qualitie of

a thing, by which it is ſhadowed. Now man in his Image, not onely reſembled his Maker in knowledge and vnderſtanding, but was alſo created in other celeſtiall conditions, as Iuſtice, Wiſedome, Mercy, Loue, &c. (as before was declared) yet ſo,Hebr. 1.3. Coll. 2.9. & 1.15. as that Chriſt alone is the very ingrauen forme of his perſon, according to his Deitie, and in his Humanitie, ſo farre as it is capable of the ſame. And to this end hath God predeſtinated and elected vs, that we ſhould be conformable to the Image of his Sonne.Rom. 8.29. Therefore God made vs of an vnderſtanding nature, and capable of diuine perfection, when with theſe heauenly properties our ſoules were firſt endued, which now cannot be againe recouered but thorow the helpe of Chriſt, the true patterne and type of our firſt created Image. To conclude, how like we were made to God, appeareth by our propoſed end of that ſelfe-ſame happineſſe and bliſſe which wee feare to looſe, and waite (through hope) to enioy with God himſelfe, both in louing and knowing of him as hee is.
                     Mans ſoule by creation, had Reaſon and Will, (as it 
                           section 9 were) for two wings: Reaſon to vnderſtand and know, and Will to approue and elect things vnderſtood and knowne. And theſe two wings did with equall force and ſweet conſent carry vp and ſupport the ſoule, to guide it aright to God; that ſo it might ſore aloft (with her affections) as the Eagle flying carryeth her young ones to inure them with the Sunne; ſo it might lift vp it ſelfe aloft from all infection whatſoeuer: A rectitude and vprightneſſe was alſo added that it might beare the force and power (as it were) of a cleare and pleaſant gale of winde, to theſe two wings; which blaſt receiued into the braine, did carry and freſhly ſet forward the powers of the minde, as when the flight of the Larke or Nightingale (aſcending on high) is haſtened with a quicke and pleaſant winde, wherewith theſe birds are ſo delighted, that the higher they flye aloft towards the skye, the more ſweetly doe they ſing.
                     Such a heauenly harmonie and conſent was in all the

faculties of the ſoule, that alwayes and altogether they aſpired with ioy to holy and heauenly things. All excellent learning and skill was engrauen in mans ſoule: his Reaſon was more ſharpe and cleare then the Eagles eye, which can behold the Sunne: his Knowledge ſurpaſſed all Arts and Sciences, ſo that by nature he could approach vnto the eternall light, and vnderſtanding of God himſelfe, and heauenly things, as the Angels and holy Spirits themſelues.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. Man in his firſt and beſt eſtate was mutable by nature, and ſubiect to fall, and ſo righteouſly made of God, without any cauſe of iuſt complaint.
                     
                        
                        NOW for the better humbling of man in this his high eſtate, that hee might know himſelfe farre inferiour vnto God that thus had exalted him, and acknowledge his ſubiection, by the ſoueraignety of his Maker: It pleaſed God in his wiſedome to ſet a great difference, as betweene the Angels and himſelfe in their creation,Ioh. 3.2. Exod. 3.14. Eſay 44.24. Rom. 11.36. Acts 17.28. ſo betweene man made like to God, made like (I ſay) to himſelfe, but not himſelfe, who onely hath this name and nature (I am,) to ſhew his being of himſelfe, and vnchangeable nature; and to teach vs that all creatures haue not onely their being, but their ſtanding and vpholding by him that onely is: Therefore he is called the liuing God, not onely becauſe hee hath life in himſelfe, but becauſe hee is the fountaine and originall of life: he doth not onely liue, but hath life of himſelfe, and is the cauſe of life, becauſe there is no life beſides or without him.
                     
                         Though mans nature (ſaith Auguſtine) was vpright and ſound,Aug. in lib. de peccat. merit. & remiſſ.
                         and nothing ſinfull, yet was it capable of ſinne, and apt to receiue infection: Though man in his nature

was mortall (ſtanding in his ſtate) yet was it not of neceſſitie that he ſhould die; and as our fleſh is apt to receiue a wound, yet euery one is not wounded; and as the body of man is ſubiect to ſickneſſe, yet many often die, not touched with ſickneſſe: So the ſtate of Adams body was ſuch, that although it was ſubiect to death, yet except ſinne had come betweene, he might and ſhould haue liued for euer:Deut. 8.4. euen as the hoſe and ſhooes of the Hebrewes in the deſart, by Gods mighty prouidence and power, neuer waxed olde by wearing or conſumption.
                     Neither was this vnreaſonable in God, nor vnagreeable  to his iuſtice, to make a diſtinction betweene himſelfe and his creatures, for that he himſelfe is onely good, without change and alteration, all his creatures good, yet ſubiect to corruption. Man was made of a mutable nature, in power of ſtanding, and poſſibility of falling: power of ſtanding he had from God his creatour: poſſibility of falling from himſelfe, being a creature.
                           Aug.
                         Becauſe the Lord created man of nothing, therefore he left poſſibility in man to returne to nothing.
                           Baſil.
                         If God had giuen Adam an immutable nature, he had created a God and not a man, being onely proper to God to be vnchangeably good. In the very Angels in heauen (in reſpect of God) is found imperfection:Iob 15.15. Eſay 6.2. the Cherubs hide their faces with their wings, for the brightneſſe of his glory. Thus God doth humble all his creatures to exalt himſelfe, euen to teach them this; not to goe from him of whom they had and haue their goodneſſe, nor to truſt vnto themſelues, though by creation good, yet ſubiect to decline.
                     
                        Adam then, although he was created in goodneſſe, yet was he made but changeably good: for ſuch was the goodneſſe and inclination of his will to obey God, as might be altered and changed by force of temptation. The cauſe of this mutability was, that the creature righteous by creation, may remaine eternally, and conſtantly righteous; two helpes or fauours of God are neceſſarily required: Firſt a power to perſeuere in goodneſſe; for

without this power the creature of it ſelfe ceaſeth to be good: the ſecond is, an act or deede, and that is the will to perſeuere, or perſeuerance itſelfe: This alſo is requiſite with the former;Phil. 2.13. for God giues not onely the power, but alſo the will and deede: and the creature doth not the good which it can doe, vnleſſe God cauſe it to doe the ſaid good; both which helpes the good Angels haue, and therefore keepe them ſtanding: now Adam receiued the firſt of God, but not the ſecond; for beſides the goodneſſe of his will, he receiued of God a power conſtantly to perſeuere in goodneſſe, if he would: yet the act of perſeuerance was left to the choiſe and liberty of his owne will.
                     
                         In nature it ſelfe, this truth appeareth. God we know creates the eye, and puts into it the faculty of ſeeing; yet withall he addes to the eye neceſſary helpes by the light of the Sunne; but for the act of ſeeing, it is left to mans choiſe, for he may ſee if he will, or if he pleaſe he may ſhut his eyes. Againe, the Phyſition by Art procures an appetite: this done, he prouides conuenient foode; yet for all this, the patient may eate if he will, or otherwiſe may abſtaine.
                     
                         Now if any reply, that Adam receiued not ſufficient grace, hauing not the will to will that good he could and might:
                           Obiection.
                         the anſwer is,
                           Anſwere.
                         that he receiued ſufficient for the perfection of his nature: that is, for the full obedience of the will of God, and for the attaining of euerlaſting happineſſe, if he would not haue bin wanting to himſelf, but he receiued not ſufficient grace, which might cauſe the immutability of his nature; neither was it of neceſſitie to be giuen (as I haue already ſhewed) to a creature. A Goldſmith intends to make a Iewell of ſingular price and value, he compounds it of gold, pearles and precious ſtones; when hee hath brought it to perfection, he doth not put this propertie to it, that if it fall, it ſhall not be bruiſed or broken. Now God created Adam in all perfection, and gaue him power and abilitie to continue in the ſame, if he would: yet did

he not put vnto his nature this condition, that it ſhould be vnchangeable, when it ſhould be aſſayled by the force of outward temptation.
                     By this we ſee the weakeneſſe of the excellenteſt creature  in it ſelfe, without the grace of God. Adam could fall of himſelfe, but he could not ſtand or riſe againe: he could not auoide the leaſt aſſault of euill, no further then he was helped by the grace of God. We are to God as the ſicke man to his keeper, who ſaith, Take me vp and I will riſe, hold me and I will ſtand, helpe me and I will goe, &c. Which muſt make vs to renounce our ſelues, and cleaue to God, wholly depending vpon his gratious prouidence and protection in all our actions and attempts. God (I confeſſe) could haue made our firſt parents of ſuch an vnchangeable nature, that they could not poſſibly haue fallen away, but it was not expedient that they ſhould be ſo made, becauſe then the obedience of man ſhould ſeeme to haue beene forced (as it were) and ſo not ſo acceptable vnto God.Gen. 2.7. And albeit the body of man being made of duſt and earth, and himſelfe in reſpect of his ſubſtance and beginning was mortall: yet if he had preſerued the holy ſpirit of God within him, and giuen him the vpper hand, this ſpirit of God, which by ſinne he vanquiſhed, had farre ſurmounted all that was mortall in him.
                     And to end this point. As Sathan tempted Adam, to  proue God a lyer, and to bring him to diſhonour,Gen. 3.1.4.5.6. and ſo became the inſtrument of mans damnation. So alſo Adam tempted himſelfe to taſte the fruit, which (as he thought) would make himſelfe as God. Now God moſt iuſtly ſuffered him to be tryed by this meanes, to make a way for his iuſtice, in the condemnation of the reprobate, and an entrance for his mercy in the ſaluation of his elect; for if there had beene no fall of man, God ſhould haue manifeſted himſelfe neither iuſt in condemning ſome, nor mercifull in ſauing others, which very much would haue obſcured his glory, and altogether depriued him of his praiſes amongſt the ſonnes of men, &c.
                     
                        
                         Man was ſubiect to death by nature, yet not of neceſſitie, as though he ſaw no way to ſhunne it: (and now I goe no further then mans knowledge reuealed in the word, ſetting Gods decree and ſecret counſell aſide) for he had ſufficient power giuen him of God in his creation to auoide it.Rom. 2.15. Gods law was written in his heart, agreeable to his nature, he thought it no yoake or burthen to obſerue it, his ſhoulders or backe being bigge enough to ſuſtaine it: Sinne therefore, wee may ſee, hath diminiſhed our ſtrength, and altered our nature, that now we are forced to be ſlaues to thoſe, who before were our ſubiects. Gods law (now written) is the ſame which before was engrauen in our nature; yet now it is ſuch a huge weight and heauie yoake,Acts 15.10. Mat. 23.4. which neither we, nor our fathers were euer able to beare.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. III. Of the greatneſſe of Adams ſinne, and his grieuous fall: with the fearefull effects and fruites thereof.
                     
                        
                        MAn being thus created in ſo glorious an eſtate, raigning and ruling, not onely as a Prince, but (as it were) a petty God vpon the earth, all things being put in ſubiection vnder his feete, Sathan that olde ſerpent and enuious aduerſary of mankinde, hauing fallen himſelfe and his aſſociates (by his and their owne tranſgreſſion) into a moſt curſed and wretched eſtate, enuying at the bleſſedneſſe of our firſt parents, ſo happily planted vpon the earth, and placed in Paradiſe (poſſeſſing the body of the Serpent, and abuſing his forme) drew Enah by his wiles to heare her God accuſed of vnkindneſſe,Gen. 3.1. and from hearing to ſuſpition, and from ſuſpition to plaine rebellion againſt his law; and ſo Sathan not contented, ſhe was made his ſnare to catch her husband alſo.
                     
                        But marke (I pray you) this diuels proceeding, and ſee  what hookes this Fiſher hid vnder his fine and pleaſant baites. Firſt he bewitcheth her ſences with a faire ſight and pleaſant ſhew of the forbidden fruit;Gen. 3.6. v. 3.4. then he aſſaileth her with infidelity, and doubtfulneſſe of Gods word: namely, that they ſhould die the death: thirdly, he oppoſeth himſelfe againſt the vndoubted truth of Gods word, ſetting downe the contrary, Ye ſhall not die: laſtly,verſe 4.5. he pricketh them forward to pride, and ſelfe-loue, Ye ſhall be as Gods, euen as cunning as the higheſt in good and euill: So they poore creatures not reſting vpon God, nor asking counſell at his word, but truſting to themſelues (deceiued by his ſtrange deluſions) yeelded, and in yeelding were ſeduced, and ſo ſhackled with the wards of their owne ſinne,Pro. 5.22. and fetters of their owne finding out: and as he ſolde himſelfe to ſinne and Sathan by this his fall; ſo iuſtly did God ordaine the meanes to hamper him, to wit, Death and Deſtruction.
                     
                     Neither was this action contrary to his iuſtice (except  he ſhould haue denied himſelfe) nor yet repugnant to his vnchangeable word pronounced: for in the beginning (as we haue heard) God created man holy and righteous; euen like to himſelfe▪ and ſo long as he kept this forme,Gen. 1.26. he enioyed Gods preſence; his protection and prouidence ruled ouer him, he wanted nothing that was needefull for him, all the creatures were his ſeruants, they came at his call, and bowed at his becke;Gen. 2.19. he wanted nothing that heart could wiſh; he was placed in Paradiſe amidſt all paſſing pleaſures, the ground of it ſelfe yeelded forth her encreaſe, without toyle, or trauell: he was made ſubiect to no creature,verſe 9. but was Lord ouer all (him onely excepted that had thus preferred him.) Now this his gracious God and bountifull Lord, for all theſe his graces and bleſſings vnſpeakeable, required no great ſeruice or homage at his hands, he exacted no great rent, he did not ouercharge him; but onely this (to ſhew his ſoueraigne power) he gaue him a Commandement, no weighty thing to be

obſerued, but a ſmall matter, and eaſie to be performed, to wit, that he (hauing ſuch choiſe and aboundance of all things beſides) ſhould abſtaine (for his pleaſure) from taſting of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill,Gen 2.17. and all this he did to try his obedience.
                     
                         And now behold this vnkinde creature, this vngratefull wretch, and wicked man, forgetting God and his duetie, caſting aſide his bleſſings and graces (wherewith he abounded,) moſt traiterouſly, villainouſly, and ſhamefully rebelling againſt his Lord, contemneth his Creatour, and ſetteth his God at naught; he liſtneth to the Diuell, and beleeueth his lies, and followeth (like a beaſt) his ſenſuall appetite, and euen in that one thing forbidden, ſpiteth his God, regardeth not his word, feareth not death that was threatned, but eateth of the forbidden tree, maugre the beard of God, and his iudgements.
                     
                         And here let vs throughly conſider, not ſo much the matter and meanes (which was but the eating of an Apple) as the manner and meaſure of this rebellion, and ſinne, which manifeſted it ſelfe by theſe degrees: firſt a doubtfulneſſe of Gods word, which made him to ſtagger: ſecondly, a loſſe of faith, not beleeuing Gods threatning: thirdly, a niſe curioſitie in departing from Gods word, and ſeeking other wiſedome: fourthly, a pride in deſiring to be greater then God had made him: fiftly, a contempt of God, breaking his law againſt his conſcience: ſixtly, an apoſtaſie in falling from the counſell of God, to beleeue the Diuell: ſeuenthly, an ingratitude and helliſh vnkindeneſſe in driuing away, and expelling Gods holy ſpirit dwelling in them: eightly, a murthering of himſelfe and his whole poſteritie: for this fall of his was the firſt opening of the gate to all ſinne and miſery, to all mankinde. This ſinne therefore can no way be leſſened, conſiſting of ſo many moſt monſtrous and horrible impieties. Could any puniſhment poſſible be ſharpe enough for ſuch a monſtrous fact? that whereas God had giuen them ſuch liberty and freedome of all things, yet would

not ſo much as obey him in this one?
                     Againe, God did not onely binde him to obedience, but  threatned his rebellion, if thou eate thereof,
                        Gen. 2.17. 
                        thou ſhalt die the death: Notwithſtanding Gods commanding and his threatning, he is moſt careleſſe, and ſwiftly runnes headlong to ſinne and wickedneſſe, and ſo entred into ſuch a maze of miſeries, from whence neither himſelfe, nor his poſteritie, were euer able to vnwinde themſelues: for ſo abuſing his owne free will, he loſt it, and was made a ſlaue to Sathan and himſelfe. Gods image being by his fall defaced, he became like the diuell, and contemning life, he found out death, euen death eternall. This was the wages of his ſinne, this was the hire of his labour,Rom. 6.23. this profit reaped he for his paines.
                     God thruſt him out of Paradiſe, and being expelled, he was kept out by the Cherubins, ſo preſently he ſaw  his ſhame, his figge leaues could not couer his nakednes;Gen. 3.24. but God accurſed him and his ſeede; he plagued the earth with barrenneſſe, and cauſed all the creatures to feele the ſmart of this his fall: and as he diſobeyed God, ſo procured he the diſobedience of all the creatures towards himſelfe. Hereof comes the fierceneſſe of Lyons, Beares, Tygers, Wolues, and all wilde beaſts: hence ariſeth all rebellions, and vprores, warres, ſeditions, ſcarcitie, dearth, & hunger, colde, and nakedneſſe; murther, plagues, and all kinde of calamities that are in the world, all which are forerunners of this eternall death, and ring-leaders to damnation.
                     Thus Sathan ſuggeſting a want of knowledge, becauſe he knew not euill, and ſo corrupting his heart with a curious deſire thereof (not able of himſelfe to effect the ill  that he ſuggeſteth) procured man to the practiſe of ill, before he could obtaine to the knowledge thereof: euen as a man commeth to the knowledge of poyſon by the dangerous taſte thereof: ſo deare was the purchaſe of euils experience, that it ſodainely procured mans ruine and fall. And ſo his paſſions were made to ſee, and his Reaſon blinde: in ſearching for knowledge, hee met with

error. So Reaſon it ſelfe (the lampe of mans ſoule) which like the Sunne in the firmament, ſpreading her beames thorough mans little centre, is now become ſo dimme and darke, in his cloudy and ecclipſed skye, that the eye of the ſoule is as voide of light in things diuine, as the little ſparkes of fire raked vp cloſe in the aſhes: which blindnes and ignorance of God and heauenly things, were not perſonall in Adam himſelfe, but by poſſeſſion entred into all his poſteritie and of-ſpring.
                     
                         And originall ſinne (the fountaine and wel-ſpring of all the reſt) as a peſtilent poyſon infected euery part. This is that canker of our nature, and contagious infection, the vtter confuſion of mans ſtate, the roote of iniquitie, the puddle of all dregges, the ſeede of rebellion, the pumpe of all enormities, whence iſſueth infinite and innumerable vices: This is the pit of perdition, which Adam digged for himſelfe and his broode, in this we were left, in this we were loſt, in this we were condemned, in this conuicted: This ſinne is deriued by propagation, and laid vpon vs; and by imitation confirmed, and multiplied in all mankinde; whoſe very bones by the ſame are corrupted, ſinewes tainted, veines infected, arteries poyſoned, fleſh polluted, wit confounded, minde captiuated, knowledge turned into ignorance, wiſedome to errour, will to wilfulneſſe, memory to forgetfulneſſe, the whole ſoule to ſinfulneſſe, reaſon to rebellion, innocency to impudency, and immortality to death it ſelfe, both of ſoule and body: So that man now of his owne nature is no leſſe the bondſlaue of ſin, then the ſlaues which are bought,Rom. 7.14.15. whoſe Maiſters vſe their ſeruice, as that of their Oxen and Aſſes, at their pleaſure. So are we wholly led vnder the gouernment of ſin, being wholly addicted to the ſeruice thereof.
                     
                         And ſo much the more is our ſlauery, that in our corrupted wills, we deſire and onely delight to ſin; which muſt teach vs to be continually touched with our miſerable ſinfull life, and in this reſpect daily to deſire and long

after death, as the onely medicine to heale theſe deadly maladies of our ſoules. Many Beaſts and Fowles (ſaith one) farre exceed mankinde in ſome vertue and good qualities, as the Doue in ſimplicitie, the Storke in kindnes, the Dogge in fidelitie,Eſay 1.3. the Oxe and Aſſe in memorie of benefits, &c. but in vice and euill man ſurpaſſeth them all; being more cruell then the Wolfe, more crafty then the Foxe, more proud then the Peacocke, &c. yea, all vices and wickednes (which are but ſeuerall in beaſts) are muſtered and troupe together in ſinfull man. And as many members vnited, make but one body; ſo doth the Spirit of God terme this heaping of vices in man, a body of ſinne, euery vice being (as it were) a member. It is ſaid,Rom. 6.6. Col. 3.5. that in a Sheepe euery thing turneth to profit; the fleſh for food, the wooll for cloathihg, &c. but euery thing that is in man, is eyther euill, or tendeth to euill; as the reaſon to beguile and deceiue, the liberty to licentiouſneſſe, the eyes to wantonneſſe, the heart to couetouſneſſe, &c. All the members (I ſay with S. Paul) are weapons, inſtruments,Rom. 6.19. Rom. 3.12. Gen. 6.5. Pſal. 14.3. and ſeruants to ſinne. All his actions and affections are out of order. As a man that hath a Palſie, hath ſtill a motion left of head and hands, (as hee had before his ſickneſſe) but yet his mouings are now altogether irregular and out of order; ſo all thoſe affections of the minde, as Loue, Deſire, Ioy, &c. and all naturall functions of the body, as eating, drinking, ſleeping, &c. (which ſhould haue beene performed without any ſinne) are now mixed in man with many blemiſhes and corruptions: ſo that this corruption of our fleſh (ſo long as we liue) ſendeth out the filthy ſcum of all vncleanneſſe, which continually broyleth and walloppeth in our nature, foaming out ſuch filthy froath and ſtinking ſauour to our mindes, that it is not onely deteſtable to the ſoule of the regenerate, but alſo abaſheth the very naturall man to looke into ſuch a loathſome ſtye of ſinne, and ſincke-hole of iniquities; for mighty is the power, and raging is the ſtrength of originall ſinne in all Adams ſonnes, breaking out into action.
                     
                        
                         Sinfull man (ſaith Iob) drinketh iniquitie like water, but wee may truely ſay,Iob 15.16. like wine, with pleaſure and delight; with great facilitie, cuſtome, and eaſe, paſſeth hee downe any kinde of ſinne that is offered, as a man drinketh water when hee is a thirſt.Rom. 7.17. 
                        Wee know that in vs, (ſaith Paul) that is, in our fleſh, dwelleth no goodneſſe: but whatſoeuer the corruption of our nature is, be it neuer ſo great, yet our fault is neuer the leſſe; no more then if wee had had an Angels nature, which willingly and wittingly wee would peruert. For vnto our corrupt nature wee bring of our ſelues a froward and crooked Will, which did corrupt the Angels nature, and made them fall from God. Therefore let vs not ſo much finde fault with our nature, as condemne our wicked wils, ſo ſet to worke ſinne, and with delight affecting and effecting euill. The corruption which wee haue, our pleaſure is in it; and all the goodneſſe which wee want, wee care not for it: but our Will is after our worke, and as wee are, ſo wee like our ſelues beſt.Iames 1.14.15. Sinne ſpringeth vp, and is nouriſhed in our hearts, and whatſoeuer is euill in vs, there it hath the fountaine, in which wee know firſt that ſinne is our owne, and in our hearts it breedeth as wormes in the wood.
                     
                         And as our heart is the roote of ſinne, ſo there is no ſinne but commeth from the heart:Gen. 6.5. & 8.21. if thy heart accuſe thee, thy ſinnes muſt needes bite thee. To conclude, Concupiſcence (which was the fruit of Adams eating the forbidden fruit) cleaueth now to the nature of all his ſonnes:Mat. 15.19. 
                        1 Iohn 3.20. which is the tyrant of the fleſh,Rom. 7.23. the law of the members, the nouriſhment of ſinne,Iames 1.15. the feebleneſſe of nature, and the food of death. Oh grieuous neceſſitie, and fearefull ſtate of man! before wee can ſinne, wee are lincked to ſinne, and before we offend, we are bound with offence. By one man ſinne entered into the world,

                     CHAP. IIII. Of the originall and entrance of Death: and how iuſtly it was impoſed vpon Adam and all his brood, by the propagation of Sinne, deriued vnto them.
                     
                        THE Nature of man being thus wholly  corrupted by Adams ſinne, Death preſently followed him at the heeles, to pay him his hyre. As Death at firſt was threatned, ſo ſpeedily vpon his fall was it executed, both vpon him and his: Yet touching the originall of Death (though the cauſe thereof be iuſt) it ſeemeth doubtfull, from whence it came, and what author it had.
                     For although the iſſues thereof be in the hand of God, and that it is his handmaide to execute his will (as hee alſo fetters the very Diuels themſelues,Pſal. 68.20. who can doe nothing without him,) yet all the creatures that God did make, were very good; and as he is the very goodneſſe it ſelfe, ſo nothing but good proceedes from God. Since therefore Death and the Diuell be enemies to God and goodneſſe, deſtroyers, and corrupters of Nature, which he hath made; they are none of his creatures; hee is neyther their author, nor they of his off-ſpring. All things which were made, were made by the word,Ioh 1.2.3. and all things which were made by the word were exceeding good:Gen. 1.31. Euill then in generall, and Death in particular, which is euill in it ſelfe, were not made of God; and nothing can be good, without the ſoueraigne goodneſſe, which is God himſelfe. And whereas good is not, there is euill; which in effect is nothing elſe, but the priuation of good, as death is the want of life, and blindneſſe the want of ſight. Lord (ſaith Auguſtine) thou haſt not made death,
                        
                           Aug. in Soliloq.
                         
                        neyther haſt thou pleaſure in the deſtruction of the liuing, therefore ſuffer not that which thou haſt not made, to haue dominion ouer me, whom thou haſt

made. God made not Death, but man after hee fell to ſinne, receiued the ſentence of his diſloyaltie and reuolt, that he ſhould returne to duſt, of which he was framed.
                     
                         The Diuell hath the power of Death, that is, hee is the author of Death; who by his malicious nature brought it into the world: for God made it not, neyther hath any delight therein, neyther is it good in his eyes, nor euer mentioned amongſt his workes; but from the Diuell, and of the Diuell, and in the Diuell it beganne, and is, and abideth:Reuel. 9.11. and therefore his name is rightly giuen him, Abaddon, that is, a deſtroyer. And as death is of him, ſo for this cauſe alſo hee is ſaid to haue the power of it, becauſe through his manifold temptations hee maketh men ſinne,Mr. Dearing on Heb 2. Rom. 5.12.14. by which Death raigneth. For ſo ſaith S. Paul of Adam ſeduced by the Diuell. Chriſt then vanquiſhed him that had the power of Death; that is, hee aboliſhed ſinne, and the condemnation of ſinne, which was the Kingdome of the Diuell, and thereby triumphed ouer him. For this cauſe (ſaith S. Iohn) the Sonne of God appeared,
                        1 Iohn. 3.8. 
                        that he might looſe the workes of the Deuill, that is, Sinne and Death, which are both of the Diuell: for Sinne God condemneth, and of Death hee ſaith,Hoſ. 13.14. 
                        I will be thy deſtruction; proteſting thereby that hee is author of neyther. If God had made Death, why did Chriſt weepe for Lazarus his death,Iohn 11.35. for he ought not to mourne for that himſelfe had made?
                           Aug. contra Pellagian.
                         but by this ſorrow hee ſhewed that thoſe that God had made to liue, the Diuell by ſinne had made to dye, and therefore he raiſed him from the graue, that Sathan might know he ſhould little gaine by mans death.Ezech. 18. 
                        I will not the death of a ſinner, (ſaith the Lord.) If God were the author of Death, how could hee but be the willer of the ſame? Not God then, but the Diuell is the author of Death.
                     
                         God made Adam without corruption, and created him after his owne Image, yet thorow enuy of the Diuell came Death, and they that hold of his ſide proue it: ſo that the Father of Death is the Diuell; and as he is euill by nature, ſo likewiſe is Death in it ſelfe, iſſuing and proceeding

from ſuch a fountaine.Rom. 5.12. & 6.23. The Diuell is the author of Sinne, and conſequently of Death: for by Sinne Death entered, and Death is the wages thereof.1 Iohn 3.8. 
                        Hee that committeth ſinne is of the Diuell, for the Diuell ſinneth from the beginning; hee is a murtherer from the beginning; hee is both a lyer,
                        Iohn 8.44. 
                        and the father thereof, not by creation, but by corruption. God made him an Angell, hee made himſelfe a Diuell; ſo falling from God, hee fell from goodneſſe, and became the father of ſinne and wickednes. Non ſtetit in veritate;Iohn 8.44. he ſtood not in the truth. Hee that cauſed Sin, cauſed Death for ſinne: The third part of the waters became Wormewood,
                        Apoc. 8.10.11. 
                        and many men dyed of the waters, becauſe they were made bitter. Bitternes cauſed death; but whence came the bitterneſſe? from the Starre that fell into the waters, called by the name of Wormewood.
                     
                     And albeit that Death proceeded of the Diuell (as wee  haue heard) yet is it alſo attributed vnto man himſelfe, to leaue him inexcuſable, as plainely appeareth by Paul his compariſon betweene Chriſt and Adam.
                        Rom. 5.17.18. 
                        As by the offence of one man (ſaith hee) death raigned ouer all, and ſinne came ouer all, to condemnation: ſo by Chriſt, which is one, the benefit of grace abounded towards all men, to Iuſtification of life. In which Antitheſis wee may ſee Death ſeazing vpon all men through Adam, and that very iuſtly: ſo that Man and Diuell are partners in ſinne, and ſo in death. Here two things concurre together, the tempter and the obeyer. Sathan tempted, and man conſented: He tempted and perſwaded of enuy, intermingling the matter with belying and ſlandering of the truth, to haue man breake Gods commandement: notwithſtanding all this, Sathan had nothing preuailed, had man reſiſted, and not conſented to his temptation. Therefore wee may conclude, that in reſpect of Sathans enuy, lying, and other euill attempts, tending all to mans deſtruction, hee may be called (as hee is indeede) the author of death: yet in regard of mans conſent, in tranſgreſſing Gods Law, Death may duely be imputed to himſelfe, although there were none other cauſe:

for that he was created to the likeneſſe of God himſelfe;Gen. 1.27. and flouriſhed with Free-will, which as then hee poſſeſſed.
                     
                         The Diuell then is not the proper and abſolute cauſe of ſin, becauſe that the nature of the abſolute & proper cauſe is ſuch, that it going before, the effect cannot chooſe but follow after. But it falleth not out ſo alwayes in man prouoked of the Diuell, who although he continually aſſaile and moſt vehemently aſſault Gods Saints to ſin, yet ſinne doth not alwayes follow his aſſaults; his worke is not euer effectuall. For many of Gods Children very mightily reſiſt him,1 Pet. 5.9. Iames 4.7. Mat. 4.6. being armed with Faith, which weapon hee flyeth. The Diuell vſed no violence to Chriſt, but onely ſaid; Caſt thy ſelfe downe head long; that wee may know, that Sathan ſeduceth none, but ſuch as obey him: aſſault hee may to euill, but compell vs hee cannot, if wee reſiſt him;
                           Chriſoſt. on Mat. 4.6. Ierome.
                         ſo ſaith Chriſoſtome. They are to be reproued (ſaith Ierome) who thinke our thoughts and cogitations to to be ſent of Sathan, and not to proceede from mans free-will, ſeeing the Diuell may be an inuenter of euill thoughts, but not the author.
                        
                           Seneca.
                         The eye neuer offendeth if the minde gouerne the eye:Iob. 31.7. 
                        Iob therefore ſaith, My heart hath not walked after my eyes. The Diuell not by compulſion, but by perſwaſion, may moue man to ſinne: ſolicite he may, but force he cannot. Neyther triumpheth he euer more greatly, then when man confeſſeth that hee hath made him ſinne;
                           Auguſtine.
                         ſo ſaith Auguſtine.
                     
                     
                         Againe, let vs image (ſaith one) the Diuell himſelfe neuer to haue fallen from God,
                           Pet. Mart. loc. com. claſſ. 1. cap. 14. ſect. 12. and man as yet to haue ſtood in his Creation; yet man by nature might haue declined, and ſhould in himſelfe haue had the cauſe of ſinne. The reaſon is this, God gaue him Free-will, and ſo left him to himſelfe: and free it cannot be, except hee had choyſe of good and euill: yet not ſo vnarmed and naked was hee left, but that his Creator gaue him power and ſtrength ſufficient to continue, if hee would, in his vpright eſtate, wherein hee left him: howbeit hee

truſting too much to himſelfe, and leauing Gods Law, and not vſing, but rather abuſing, the meanes that God had giuen him, hee might haue fallen from his Creation, and ſo intangled himſelfe in the ſnare of death and condemnation. So that in this ſuppoſition, the ſuggeſtion of the Diuell is not ſimply the cauſe of ſinne and death; the Diuell (as yet) not falling from God, but remayning in his nature an Angell of light. Neyther hath hee ſuch power (as I haue proued) ouer the will of man, to bowe it as hee liſteth, to his purpoſe. Therefore once againe to conclude this poynt, not onely the Diuell, but euen our firſt Parents themſelues, were the firſt cauſes of Sinne, and ſo of Death.
                     Although indeede (to ſpeake properly) an euill thing  hath no cauſe efficient, but rather deficient.
                           Aug. de ciuit. dei. lib. 12. cap. 7. And if any man will goe about ouer-curiouſly to ſearch out the efficient cauſe of Death, it is all one as if a man ſhould labour with his eyes to ſee darkeneſſe; and bend the ſenſe of his eares to heare ſilence: which (ſince they be of themſelues meere priuations) haue no eſſence in nature, though exiſtent in ſome ſubiect, and knowne vnto vs. The ſight ſeeth nothing but bright things, and the eare heareth nothing but a noyſe of loud things: theſe things are knowne to our ſenſes, not by vſe, but by priuation onely. Death is a priuation of life, onely hauing a name, and no nature or ſubſtance; God therefore made it not: for whatſoeuer hee made, had an eſſence, and a kinde of ſubſtance; Death therefore being nothing but the abſence of life (as hunger the want of meate, thirſt of drinke, darkneſſe of light, barrenneſſe of fruit, pouerty lacke of riches, &c.) is nothing but in name, and ſo no creature of God. The deficient cauſe therefore of Sinne and Death, is the Diuell and Man: the Diuell by ſuggeſting, Man by obeying, both their actions not vrged of God, but voluntary of themſelues.
                     
                        
                         Let this therefore be for our inſtruſtion by the way: Whoſoeuer committeth ſinne is of the Diuell;1 Iohn 3.4. whoſoeuer ſinneth is the ſeruant of death: neither yet let vs ſo rage againſt the diuell, as that wee altogether exempt our ſelues from guilt; but rather knowing the readineſſe of the diuell in aſſailing, and our owne willingneſſe in obeying, we ought both to renounce the diuell, and forſake our ſelues, and cleaue onely in this extremitie to the Lord.
                     
                         Now how iuſtly Death was deriued from Adam to all his heires, will better appeare, by the ſucceeding inheritance of ſinne, to all his poſteritie and race. For God beſtowed his gifts and graces vpon Adam, vpon condition, that hee ſhould conuey them to his ſeede, if hee himſelfe by obedience would haue kept them, but God meant not to giue them to his poſteritie, if hee by his rebellion and vnthankfulneſſe ſhould raſhly looſe them, as hee did. Adam therefore falling from God, was iuſtly depriued of theſe his graces and gifts, and as a iuſt puniſhment inflicted vpon his ſinne, did in equitie alſo depriue his whole poſteritie of the ſame. God could (I confeſſe) haue preſerued Adams ſeed from his pollutions: but it made more for his glory, that it might be knowne what we are by nature, and what by Grace.
                     
                         Furthermore, as in murther, when the hand onely ſtriketh, the whole man offendeth; ſeeing that the Law ſeuereth not the parts from the whole: ſo Adams ſinne extends it ſelfe to whole mankinde, though all ſucceeding natures are but part of him. For as a Riuer poyſoned in the Well-ſpring or fountaine, ſo was the nature of man altogether corrupted in our firſt Parents: corrupt Parents, corrupt Children. Hee was no priuate but a publike perſon, and generall head of all mankinde, and therefore his ſinne was not proper onely to his indiuiduall ſubiect, but reall and hereditary to all his Sonnes: the euill and puniſhment, whereof (by reaſon of Nature and Law) ſucceeded by right to all his brood. For as the Law of God was giuen to Adam and his heyres, euen firſt and

laſt: ſo was the firſt breach thereof vniuerſall, and all in him did plucke and taſte the forbidden fruit, to their endleſſe woe. And as wee ſee many thouſand men in a Citie doe make but one Corporation and Societie, who all participate in gaine and loſſe of their Liberties and Freedomes: ſo Adam and all his heyres, though in number they paſſe the Stars of the Skye and in multitude ſhould ſurmount the very ſands of the Sea, are ſtill but one,
                           Graue illud delictum, quod non ſolum perſonā inficit ſed & naturam. Bernard. and in forfeiture of their priuiledges and freedomes muſt needes remaine alike: Great indeede was that ſinne, which not onely infected the perſon, but nature it ſelfe, and the whole ſtocke.
                     And as it is moſt iuſt with men to diſinherit the ſtained  iſſue of tainted Traitors to King and State: ſo is it iuſtice with God to be reuenged on Adam and all his ſinfull race, and to depriue him and his ſeede of all his natiue vertues which were giuen to him in truſt: Leprous fathers beget leprous children, which are infected by theirs and their owne Leproſie. As euery man dieth of his owne diſeaſe, and yet it may be he had the contagion from another, ſo for Adams ſinne, as it was imputed vnto vs, we die, and yet not for Adams ſinne alone, but for our owne; for in vs there is the very matter of corruption.
                     It is all one as if a man vpon eaſie conditions ſhould gaine an high eſtate to him and his for euer, and yet ſhould wittingly and wilfully forfeite it againe to the owner; who would either moane the heire, or blame the giuer? Euen ſo, God hauing made the ſoule of man good, righteous, and faire, as from himſelfe, yet knitting it to the body, to make the man (which man is Adams heire) he may iuſtly withdraw his graces from it, as his owne, being forfeited and loſt by traiterous man. Thus Gods grace moſt iuſtly fayling the ſoule, it falleth to ſinne and declineth to naught; which proneneſſe of euill is our naturall ſickneſſe, which we call Originall ſinne.
                     
                     So that the ſoule of man is not now created with that  ſtrength to perſeuere in goodneſſe, and reſiſtance of

euill, and other excellent graces which it ſhould haue had, if Adam had not ſinned: and albeit it be pure and vnſpotted as it proceedeth from God; yet is it no ſooner ioyned to the body, but it is preſently polluted▪ euen as the pureſt wine and beſt quinteſſence, when it is powred into a filthy pot, poyſoned and vnſauory, doth in a moment looſe their naturall taſte and tallage: ſo doth the ſweet ſoule looſe her fragrant ſmell of grace and goodneſſe, ſo ſoone as it is ſent into this filthy veſſell, the body of ſinne. Neither is the ſoule of man ſubiect onely to weakeneſſes and infirmities in reſiſting of corruptions, but hath many other defects, both of minde and will, being deſtitute of ſpirituall life and light, blinde by nature, and not ſo much as inclinable to holy deſires and ſanctified workes, as God (her Creatour) by his law requireth.
                     And although in the iuſt iudgement of God (as we haue already heard) mens ſoules be now made in ſuch  ſort, as that of neceſſitie they muſt be defiled (being ioyned to theſe bodies of ſinne) yet are they not thereby to be excuſed from the guilt of ſinne; for though it be of a iuſt neceſſitie, yet is it not of any compulſion that they ſhould ſinne; as we ſee by experience, Iron and Stones, and ſuch like graue and heauie ſubſtances (though neuer ſo ſoftly let downe into a brooke) doe of neceſſitie, yet not by any violence, ſinke downe to the bottome thereof. Bodies depriued of foode, and fleſh, in time doe putrifie of neceſſity, yet neither the one, nor the other by any compulſion. God of neceſſitie is good, and the Diuell is euill, yet can we not ſay that either goodnes in God, or iniquity in the Diuell, doe proceede of compulſion. So our ſoules being ioyned to our bodies are of neceſſitie ſinfull, yet willingly alſo and of their owne accord.
                     
                         Neither yet is it or can be otherwiſe now with the beſt regenerate, and holieſt men (renewed in Chriſt) towards their children, then it was in Adam at the firſt, touching the propagation of originall ſinne; they can conuey no more vnto their poſteritie, but that which by nature they

are poſſeſſed of; for grace comes from heauen, and our new birth is not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh,
                        Iohn 1.13. 
                        nor of the will of man, but of God. If we winnow any Wheate or graine neuer ſo perfectly, and purge it neuer ſo throughly by the fanne, from the chaffe and duſt; yet when it is ſowne againe, it will not bring forth cleanſed corne, but with the graine yeelde huskes and hawnes; which alſo muſt it ſelfe be threſhed with the flayle, and cleanſed with the fanne vpon the floore: As this clenſed Corne (I ſay) can giue no more but what it had by nature; and looke what it had by the art & induſtry of man, the ſame meanes muſt be vſed to it againe, before it be cleane and fit for our vſe: Euen ſo, the faithfull, though they be waſhed,1. Cor. 8.11. iuſtified, and ſanctified by Gods ſpirit, and the blood of Chriſt; yet can they giue no more to their children then what themſelues haue had by nature, being the children of wrath: and as for any grace or goodneſſe,Eph. 2.3. it muſt come from the ſame Author, and by the ſame meanes which their parents had, to worke it in them, or elſe it can neuer be effected.
                     God doth worke in the hearts of men to incline their  wills which way hee pleaſeth, either to good things (according to his mercy,) or to euill (according to their owne deſert,) and that by his iudgement,
                           Aug. de gra. & lib. arbit. cap. 21. ſometime manifeſt, ſometime ſecret, but alwayes iuſt. A workehouſe muſt needes decline and alſo fall, when the vnder-proppes are remoued: Darkeneſſe muſt needes enſue, when the Sunne and light is departed away. Thoſe bright beames of all light and happy life, which were giuen to our firſt parents, are remoued, and other excellent gifts and graces of God are (in his iuſt iudgement) ſo long withholden from our ſoules, vntill by his holy ſpirit (as the worker) and by his holy word (as the inſtrument) God in his good time doe againe enlighten our mindes, and purifie our hearts by faith,Acts 15.9. 2. Theſ. 2.17. and confirme and ſtrengthen vs in euery good word and worke.
                     Sinne to mankinde will alwaies be a Iebuſite, a falſe 
                        
borderer, yea a ranke traitour, rebelling againſt the ſpirit, which makes the life of man to be (ſaith Chriſoſtome) a debt, as it were owne, and due to death: for the diuell is the father of ſinne, and ſinne is the mother of death:Iam. 1.15. Hereupon ſaith S. Iames, that Sinne being finiſhed, trauaileth in childe-birth (like a mother) to bring forth Death;Pſal. 9.13. and Dauid calleth ſinne the gate of death, becauſe as a man commeth into a houſe by the dore or gate, ſo death came into the world by ſinne. The corruption of our fleſh did not make our ſoule ſinfull,Lactantius. Pabulum mortis
                         but the ſinne of our ſoule did make the fleſh corruptible. Whereupon Lactantius calleth ſinne the reliefe or foode of death: and as a fire goeth out when all the fuell is ſpent, but burneth as long as it laſteth; ſo death dieth when ſinne ceaſeth, but where ſin aboundeth, there death raigneth.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. Of the Nature of Death, what it is, and how manifold, and whence Deuines haue deriued it.
                     
                        
                        DEath thus iuſtly deriued from Adam, as the ſtocke, to all and euery one of vs, his line and race, as to the boughes and branches (the leproſie of his ſin cleauing faſt to all his ſeede,) we are further to conſider the nature thereof for our better humbling, which cannot more plainely appeare, then by the true deſcribing and diuiding of the ſame, by and into his ſeuerall parts, properties, and effects, as they are laid out vnto vs, and gathered from the Scriptures.
                     As man therefore in his nature conſiſteth of two principall  parts, a humane body, and a diuine ſoule, which vnited together make but one perſon; ſo there is a Death of the body, and a Death of the ſoule, and a death that is common both to body and ſoule. Death then in it ſelfe

is not onely a killing of the body, but alſo a ſlaying (as it were) of the ſoule;Mat. 10.28. not onely a ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, but a diuiſion and cutting off both of body and ſoule from God. Hence it appeareth that Death is threefold: firſt corporall, ſecondly ſpirituall, and thirdly a death common both to body and ſoule; and all theſe kindes due to all men (without exception) for all haue ſinned, and are deſtitute of the grace of God.Rom. 3 23.
                     
                     This corporall Death (which I ſaid to be a ſeperation  of the ſoule from the body) is likewiſe called the firſt Death: And ſpirituall Death (which is a renting of the ſoule from God,Apoc. 2.11. who is the life thereof) is alſo called the ſecond Death: Both corporall and ſpirituall, or the Death that is common both to body and ſoule (which is an euerlaſting diuorce both of body and ſoule from the vnion and fellowſhip of God) is alſo called eternall death, which is inchoatiue in this life (for they that beleeue not are condemned already) and compleate in the life to come,Ioh. 3.18. when (after the reſurrection of the body) both body and ſoule ſhall euerlaſtingly be ſeperated from the Lord of life,Acts 3.15. which is alſo common to all, by reaſon of ſinne, yet not preuailing ouer Gods elect, iuſtified and freed from it by faith in Chriſt.
                     Death therefore in a word, is nothing elſe, but a departing  from life; the life of the body is the ſoule, therefore the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body is Death. And as the ſoule is the life of the body, ſo the life of the ſoule is God; therefore the going and departing of the ſoule from God (to cleaue to ſinne and Sathan) is the death alſo of the ſoule. The ſinfull ſoule dies not becauſe ſhe turnes to nothing, but in that ſhe dies to God, and liues to ſinne: for how can the ſubſtance thereof periſh, ſeeing it is the ſoule that giueth life; he that receaueth the ſoule receaueth life, and when the ſoule departeth, life flyeth away: The ſoule therefore is life, and how can it die, which is oppoſite ſo directly to death it ſelfe? For as Snow can endure no heate, but preſently it melteth, and as the Sun

in his brightneſſe can receaue no obſcuritie, but diſſipates and diſpels all darkenes by his cleare and chriſtall beames: and as the coldeſt and hardeſt Ice (at the approach of the fire) is turned into water; ſo the ſoule (which is the fountaine of life, and authour of mouing) is not capable properly of death, nor can poſſibly die. Therefore the ſoule of man being immortall ought to be well ordered, and heeded, leaſt the Immortality to ioy, ſhould turne to Immortality of ſorrow. The death of the body is not the death of the ſoule, but onely a ſeuering or parting of the ſame from the body: As in taking of a Candle out of a Lanthorne, we may take the light out, and not put out the Candle, and the Lanthorne is full of darkeneſſe, by reaſon of the light remoued, yet the Candle caſteth her light more cleare and bright: euen ſo, the ſoule departing from this body of clay, liueth and moueth afterward more freſhly and bleſſedly.
                     The ſoule then dies not becauſe it is vtterly aboliſhed,  but becauſe it is, as though it were not, & it ceaſeth to be in reſpect of righteouſnes, and fellowſhip with God: for this is the death of all deaths, when the creature hath ſubſiſting and being ſtill in it ſelfe, and yet for all that, is depriued of all happy and heauenly ſocietie with God. The ſoule in the body is the life of the fleſh; but God (which quickneth all things) is the life of our ſoules; ſo ſaith Gregorie.
                        
                           In Ezech. ohm. 17. As the body dieth when it ſendeth out the ſoule, ſo doth the ſoule die when it looſeth God. The ſeperation from God is the death of the ſoule▪
                        
                           De verbis dom. in Math. ſerm. 6. euen as the departing of the ſoule is the death of the body; ſo ſaith Auguſtine. Sinne begat the laſt, and the puniſhment of ſinne brought forth the firſt;
                           In quibuſdam dict.
                         ſo ſaith Bernard.
                     
                     The nature then of death in effect, is the abſence or depriuation  of that life which God beſtowed on man in his creation. It is an execution of Gods iuſtice and iudgement vpon man for ſinne: God ordained it in iuſtice, but man procured it by his ſinne, whoſe ſtipend it is, euen the ouerthrower of mankinde,Rom. 6.23. Heb. 2.14. an enemy to nature, the

diſſolution of Gods worke, the power of the diuell, the ſtrength of Gods wrath, and the very kingdome of hell. The death of the ſoule is to ceaſe from righteouſneſſe, and quite to be ſequeſtred from the life of God. This is called the firſt death, in reſpect of time, going (as I ſaid) before the ſecond, which is the compleate death indeede: for as the ſoule (as we haue heard) is the life of the body: ſo God is the life of the ſoule, and his ſpirit is (as it were) the ſoule of our ſoules: the want of which communion brings nothing elſe but endleſſe and eternall death.
                     Without God there is no life, therefore Adam and Euah departing from God, departed from their life, and  although their ſoules were not preſently ſeperated from their bodies, yet being gone from God their life, they lay as it were buried in their bodies, as dead carkaſes in the graues, as alſo their bodies themſelues euery moment were mortall. Sinne (ſaith Bernard) went before, and Death followed at the heeles: which if Man had preuented, death had not entred: He would not be ruled by God, and ſo was made vnable to rule his body. Thus by ſinne he loſt his life, & found out death. As his ſoule could not be diuided from God his life, but by ſinning;
                           Bernard de laude nouae militiae. Cap. 11. no more could his body be ſeperated from his ſoule but by dying: and nothing was more agreeable to Gods iuſtice then that a ſpirituall death ſhould beget a corporall, a guilty death that which is penall, and a voluntary death an ineuitable and fatall.
                     So ſoone as man through ſinne had turned himſelfe from God, ſo ſoone and as ſodainely was he deſtitute of  his grace, and ſo ſoone did the huge hoaſt of death ceaze vpon him and beſiege him, as hunger, thirſt, and nakedneſſe, ſickneſſe, ſorrow, and all kinde of miſeries. So ſoone as euer they had ſinned (ſaith Chriſoſtome) euen ſo ſoone did the Lord pronounce ſentence of death againſt them:
                           In Gen. ſuſe tractat hanc rem.
                         and euen as thoſe that are condemned of an earthly Iudge, although for a while perhaps they may be reſerued a liue in priſon, and be repriued; yet in effect they are but

dead men: Euen ſo our firſt parents, though (through the exceeding great mercy of God) after ſentence pronounced, they did long enioy their liues, yet forthwith (in effect) they were as good as dead; for no day, houre, or moment did afterwards enſue, in which they had aſſurance of their life.
                     
                         Whereby we may learne that the life of ſinners is no life indeede;Eph. 2.12.19. but a death, being eſtranged from the life of God; and none haue life in God, which want beliefe in Chriſt,1. Ioh. 5.20. for onely Chriſt (who is eternall life through faith) doth quicken vs: So that truely to acknowledge Chriſt, and thorough faith to poſſeſſe him, is to be freed from death,Ioh. 17.3. and to haue eternall life. Onely in name to profeſſe him is the part of dead men; for as whoſoeuer beleeueth not remaineth in death,
                        Ioh. 3.18.36. 
                        and hath the wrath of God ſtill ſtaying vpon him;Iohn 14.15. 1 Iohn 2.3.4. ſo none beleeueth in Chriſt that loues him not, and none loueth him that keepeth not his commandements. Hereof (ſaith Saint Iohn to the Angell of Sardis) thou haſt a name that thou liueſt,
                        Reuel. 3.1. 
                        but thou art dead: ſo Chriſt called the Scribes and Phariſees painted ſepulchers, whoſe ſoules were dead in their bodies for want of faith.Math. 23.27. Hence it was that he ſaid to the young man,Mat. 8.22. 
                        let the dead burie their dead; and Paul of the wanton Widdow, that being aliue, ſhe was but dead.
                        1. Tim. 5.6. Eph. 5.14. Eph. 2.1. 
                        Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand vp from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue thee light; you hath he quickned that were dead in your treſpaſſes and ſinnes.
                     
                     
                         As the ſoule infuſed into the body, quickeneth a maſſie piece of fleſh, which had no motion before: ſo the ſoule (to make it a liuely and a good ſoule) muſt haue (as it were) a ſoule powred into it, that is, the Spirit of God: and if this Spirit be abſent, wee are but dead from all holy motions, as the body naturall is from outward actions by abſence of the ſoule. So that a man may liue a life in the fleſh, and yet be dead in reſpect of the life of God. Againe, as the body (while it hath a ſoule) is but a naturall body (waſting it ſelfe like oyle in the Lampe) and cannot chooſe but in the end to dye; yet after this life

ſhall be called a ſpirituall body, not in ſubſtance, but in qualitie; becauſe in the reſurrection it ſhall be quickened by the ſpirituall power of Chriſt: So a man that hath but ſimply a ſoule (if hee haue not the true ſoule of the ſoule, which is the Spirit of God, to quicken and reuiue it) hee is but a meere naturall man, and muſt needes be damned.
                     Furthermore, as a body raiſed vp and quickened by  the power of God, can neuer dye againe: ſo the ſoule of a faithfull man, being a ſpirituall ſoule (hauing once receiued the earneſt of Gods Spirit, and a meaſurable power of true Sanctification from the holy Ghoſt) can neuer dye. Now the life of Gods Spirit hath three degrees in Gods elect: Regeneration in this life, when we are renued in our affections, and doe feele a true change of minde within vs: the ſecond after this life, when the ſoule ſhall be ſeparated from the body, which being once (as it were) releaſed from the fetters of the fleſh, ſhall ſwiftly take her flight to heauen; and then ſhall the ſoule liue indeede a heauenly life, being altogether freed from the temptations of the Diuell, and all allurements of the fleſh. But the higheſt degree of all, of the ſoules eſtate, is, at the generall day of reſurrection, when the world, with the luſts thereof, ſhall paſſe away like a cloud, and be ſodainely wrapped vp like a ſcrole: for then both the body and ſoule of man ſhall not onely enioy the preſence of God, but liue alſo with him for euer in heauenly bliſſe.
                     So likewiſe the reprobate in this life, and in the life to  come haue double miſeries coupled to their double deaths. For firſt, while they liue they want Gods grace and fauour, being ſtrucken with terrour in their conſcience,Gen. 4.14. (as Cain that runnagate and vagabond) not onely fearing their liues, but being frighted at their ſhadowes. And they haue the Diuell,2 Cor. 4.4. (who is the God of this world) poſſeſſing them,2 Tim. 2.26. and ſtill leading them captiues (by the cords and chaines of all manner of wickedneſſe) towards hell and damnation;Prou. 5.22. and in the life to come they are not

onely depriued of the preſence of God, but ſuffer and endure all endleſſe and vnſpeakable torments with the Diuell and his Angels.Gal. 2.20. & 6.14. As Gods Children therefore being crucified to the world and the fleſh, haue the life of God liuing in them, which will moſt perfectly appeare and ſhew it ſelfe at Chriſts comming:Col. 3.3.4. ſo all fleſhly and wicked men, who haue giuen themſelues to the Fleſh, World, and Diuell, doe preſently liue the life of hell, which (they carrying about in their bodies) will clearely ſhew it ſelfe to their ſhame and confuſion, at the latter day. So that the wicked in this life, doe liue in death, and conuerſing in earth, they are the bond-ſlaues of hell.
                     
                         And as Faith in Chriſt (as I ſaid before) is the life of the ſoule in Gods elect: ſo no faith can quicken vs, which is not liuely in it ſelfe, which apprehendeth not Chriſt aright,Gal. 5.6. which worketh not by loue, which flouriſheth not with fruits;Iames 2.26. for Faith without good workes is dead. And therefore to the end wee may be reuiued (being dead and buryed in our ſinnes) we muſt firſt beleeue in Chriſt,Iohn 11.25. (which is our life) and if our beliefe be liuely, wee muſt ſhew it forth by our fruits;Reu. 3.1. otherwiſe we may haue a name to liue, and yet be dead.
                     
                         Now to vnderſtand this poynt the better, let vs obſerue what it is to be dead in ſinne. They are ſaid to be dead in their ſinnes, whom Death ſtill holdeth in the cords and bonds thereof;Epheſ. 4.15. ſuch as are ſtrangers from the life or God, that haue neyther ſenſe nor feeling of their ſinnes, nor any motion to godlineſſe,2 Tim. 2.26. to whom all goodneſſe is vnſauory; whoſe bodyes and ſoules are holden captiue of the Diuell, whom they ſerue as ſlaues: ſuch as are void of Gods Spirit, wedded to their owne wicked wils; whom the God of this world hath blinded,2 Cor. 4.4. that they can neyther ſee nor beleeue the truth; whoſe conuerſion is as hard, as to raiſe vp Sonnes of Stones vnto Abraham.
                        Mat. 3.9. Who is more dead then hee that carryeth fire in his boſome, ſinne in his Conſcience, and doth neyther feele it nor ſhake it out, nor tremble at it? for Sathan hath gotten quiet

poſſeſſion, and hee is careleſſe in aſſaulting of ſuch, in whom he hath gotten a quiet dwelling. Hence we may learne to loath our ſelues for our ſinnes, which bring vs into ſuch thraldome to Death and Diuell, which cut vs off from God, ſhut vs out of heauen, rob vs of ſaluation, and bring the euerlaſting wrath of God vpon vs, which is vnmeaſurable, infinite, and vnportable, neuer able to be ſuſtained of any, but of Chriſt our infinite God and Sauiour, who in maieſtie and power is equall with his Father.
                     Thus we haue heard the nature of death, common vnto  all, by the meanes of ſinne, without exception. Well therefore is Death deriued from a word that ſignifies to to diuide;
                           Greg. lib. 14. moral.
                         not onely for that it maketh diuiſion where it comes, but that without exception it equally diuides to all alike. Some thinke that it proceedes from bitterneſſe, for that the ſweetneſſe of the forbidden fruit proued bitter to Adam and his brood.
                           Auguſt. contra Pellag. lib. 1. Ero morſus tuus infern
                                 •
                              .
                         And Auguſtine not vnwittily deriueth Mors, à morſu, for that our firſt parents in biting the Apple, were bitten of death. Whence hee alſo alludeth to that of Oſea 15. O death, I will be thy ſting, O hell, I will be thy biting. The Grecians alſo deriue it from a word importing to looke vpwards, becauſe it brings vs to God: and they tearme it, Initiation or Perfection, becauſe in ending this life, it entereth vs, or rather perfecteth our life in heauen. And the Latines take the name thereof from mora, which ſignfieth delay,
                        
                           Mors, à mora.
                         or tarrying for a thing, becauſe it waiteth and expecteth for all men, of all ſorts and conditions. And this may ſuffice for the dedeſcription of Death, and declaration of the nature thereof.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. VI. At Death is due to all mankinde by the meanes of Sinne: ſo all creatures, actions, and experience it ſelfe preach and proclaime the ſame.
                     
                        AS the wages of Sinne is Death: ſo all Adams 
                         ſonnes hauing ſinned, muſt needes dye the death.Rom. 6.23. 
                        As in Adam (ſaith the Apoſtle) all men dye, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all beleeuers be made aliue. It is Gods Statute enacted in heauen,1 Cor. 15. that all muſt dye; (euen this were enough to caſt a cloud ouer all our fayreſt delights) but there is more behinde;Heb. 9.27. 
                        and after that comes the iudgement. The perſwaſion whereof poſſeſſing our hearts, ſhould (one would thinke) more then all penall Lawes, deterre vs from impietie. Aſhes (ſaith one) are wont to keepe the fire, the remembrance whereof wee beare about in our bodies: But I would to God that the knowledge of theſe aſhes (I meane our fraile eſtate) would keepe in our hearts the fire of Gods grace, that we might neuer forget our graue.
                     
                         And as the Law of dying was enacted at the firſt for ſinne; ſo hath it beene, and ſhall be executed vpon all men (without repeale) vnto the end. Neyther ſaith the Apoſtle any more then hath beene confirmed by a continuall courſe from the firſt creation, as the regiſters of the death and buryals (recorded in the Scripture) doe declare. Adam liued (ſaith the holy Ghoſt by Moſes) nine hundred and thirty yeares,Gen. 5.3.4.5. &c. and ſo hee dyed. Seth liued nine hundred and twelue yeares, and after dyed, &c. And is not this a true table, moſt liuely repreſenting our mortalitie and death? Of ſome others it is ſaid, that they were gathered to their fathers;Gen. 47.30. & 49.29. & 25.8. of others, to their people, &c. but of none, that hee euer eſcaped. For what man liueth and ſhall not ſee death? ſhall bee deliuer his ſoule from the hand of the graue?
                        Pſal. 89.48. Therefore

                        Ioſuah calleth Death, The way of all the world. David,

                     Wee ſee how the beſt and happieſt dayes of man ſlide  ſwiftly away, after come diſeaſes and dolefull age, and laſt comes cruell Death, the lodge of all eſtates. All muſt dye without diſtinction: wee came by the wombe, and wee muſt goe by the graue. Before wee come to the ſweet running waters of Shilo, which runne ſoftly,Eſay 8.6. we muſt paſſe the rough waters of Iorden, that runne moſt ſwiftly. Death is the Lady and Empreſſe of all the world: her ſeizure is without ſurrender, and from her ſentence there is no appeale. It is not the Maieſtie of the Prince, nor the holineſſe of the Prophet, nor grauitie of the Prelate, that ſhee reſpecteth. Strength of body, feature or comelineſſe of face, or other parts, learning, riches, or any ſuch ſecular regard, can plead againſt Death, or priuiledge any perſon againſt the graue: be thy dayes neuer ſo few, or thy yeares neuer ſo full, be they many, or be they few, all is one: Dayes, and yeares, and time, are no plea againſt the graue, but a fitter pray for Death.
                     The Decree is out, All muſt dye. Balthaſars embleame is written vpon euery mans wall,Heb. 9.27. 
                        God hath numbred thy  dayes, he hath laid thee in the ballance, thou art found too light;Dan. 5.25. though not thy Kingdome (which thou haſt not) yet thy life (which thou poſſeſſeſt) is diuided, and giuen to death. All Princes, and the baſeſt Peaſants; yea, all perſons whatſoeuer, may ſay with Iob; Corruption,
                        Iob 17.13.14. 
                        thou art my father, Rottenneſſe, thou art my mother, Wormes and Ʋermine yee are my ſiſters, yee are my brethren. All men may truely ſay, Graue thou art my bed, Sheete thou art my ſhrine, Earth thou art my couer, Graſſe thou art my carpet.Numb. 2.31. Ioſh 6.9. Numb. 10.25. Oh Death therefore demand thy due, and thou gathering hoaſt Dan, come laſt, and ſweepe all cleane away.
                     Death is not partiall, but dealeth vprightly with all,
                        
making the ſtate and condition of all men alike; that none can repine;Gen. 4.8. for as well died righteous Abell, whoſe ſacrifice God accepted, as enuious Cain, whoſe ſeruice he reiected; as well Abraham (the father of the faithfull,) as Abimelech the infidell; as well Iſaack as Iſmael; as well Iacob (whom God loued) as Eſau whom God hated; as well chaſt Ioſeph, as inceſtuous Ammon; as well meeke Moſes, as rayling Rabſheka; as well Dauid (a man after Gods owne heart) as Saul, from whom God tooke his ſpirit; as well tender-hearted Ioſiah, as hard-hearted Pharaoh; as well Salomon the wiſe, as Nabal the foole; as well poore Lazarus, as the rich Glutton; as well Iohn the beloued Diſciple, as Iudas the Traitor; as well Simon Peter, as Simon the Sorcerer: mercileſſe Death doth exerciſe her crueltie vpon all alike.
                     
                         Notable is that ſaying of Ageſilaus to diuers Captaines counſelling him to walke to the hill Olimpus, where hee ſhould ſee ſuch ſtore of wealthy Merchants, vttering a world of riches,An excellent ſaying of Ageſilaus.
                         and precious Iewels. If I could (ſaith he) buy and ſell, or exchange there, ſorrow for mirth, ſickneſſe for health, death for life, I would then goe thither, and ſpend all that I haue; but I ſee that the buyers and ſellers (yea and the very things themſelues) are condemned to dye and to periſh: Wherefore neyther the ſight of any thing there can better my eſtate, or help me at the houre of death, when I muſt creepe into my graue. For although honour, wealth and riches beare here a great ſway amongſt men, yet can they nothing at all preuaile againſt the graue, and Death it ſelfe. Men by wiſedome haue found out how the hardeſt ſtones may be broken and ſoftened, how wilde beaſts may be tamed, &c. but nothing could be inuented, whereby Death might be auoyded.
                     Gods hand (ſaith one) may a man eſcape, but for Deaths dart no man can ſhunne it. Againſt bodily enemies there may Fortreſſes be made, Caſtles and Bulwarkes builded; but to Death and his forces all men lye open, as vnfenced Cities. In other dangers, power, money, flight, counſell,

and policie, may ſerue our turne; but as for Death, it can neyther be baniſhed with power, bought with money, nor eſcaped with flying away, nor preuented with counſell, nor turned backe with policie. All (I ſay) without redreſſe, muſt haſten vnto Deaths home. Hee therefore that thinketh it ſtrange to dye, forgetteth himſelfe and his owne nature, complaineth of the God of heauen, that ſuffered him to be borne a man, and not an Angell.
                     Death is the common road-way of all the world, there  is no by-paths any nearer, or nearer way; no, not for Kings and Emperours themſelues. What worlds of men are gone before vs? yea, how many thouſands out of one field? How many Crownes and Scepters lye pyled vp at the gates of Death? Men are here as in a voyage, the which wee muſt one day finiſh: yeſterday we came into this vale of teares, and to morrow (if our Maker will) we ſhall goe out. One goes before, another followes: one man rots in the graue, and makes it empty, that he which is yet aliue, may haue place therein. Or if we ſhould continue here long, yet can wee not eſcape; for that all mortall men are encloſed in Deaths Parke. Whether wee goe ſoftly, or runne ſwiftly, whether wee dye willingly, or end our dayes grudgingly (when the appointed time is come) wee muſt yeeld our ſelues to the Law of Death. Doe wee flye? Death yet followes vs, and catcheth vs behinde; in retyring backe, ſhee approacheth neare vs; turning from her, ſhee ſurpriſeth vs ſodainely, and ceaſeth not like a greedy Beare, and hungry Lyon, vntill ſhee hath broken our bones, and torne our fleſh in ſunder.
                     Death equally drags away all men which haue beene, are, or ſhall be: We are diſtinguiſhed by times, but made equall in the Iſſue. Some are ſent before, others come after; but all goe the ſame way without exception. In all theſe reuolutions of humane things, there is nothing certaine but Death, and yet euery one complaineth of that which neuer yet failed any. Wee dye hourely, and as we grow our life decreaſeth: for what is the beginning of

Youth, but the death of Infancie? the entrance of Manhood but the end of Youth? and what is the beginning of to morrow but the death of to day? Wee are no ſooner entered into the earth, but wee are conſtrained to returne to the earth againe, as it were from one ſepulchre to another; euen from the wombe to a beginning to liue and die together: ſo as the moſt part of the time Death giues vs no warning, but by the blow it ſelfe. Many thinke they neuer dye, but when they yeeld vp the laſt gaſpe of Death, but if wee marke it, wee dye euery day and moment: for our very liuing (as I ſaid) is a continuall dying; wee no ſooner ſet a ſtep into life, but wee enter a ſtep into death. Of our life all the time paſt is dead, the preſent liues and dyes at once, and the future likewiſe ſhall periſh. The time paſt is no more, the future is not yet, the preſent onely is and no more. This whole life (I ſay) is but a death. It is like a candle lighted in our bodies; in one the winde maketh it melt away, in another blowes it cleane out, ere halfe it be burned; in others it endureth vnto the end: but looke how much ſoeuer it ſhineth, ſo much it burneth; her ſhining is her burning, her light a vaniſhing ſmoake, her laſt fire her laſt wyke, and her laſt drop of moyſture: So is it in the life of man; his life and death are all one.
                     
                         But how ſhould man be ignorant of his death, vnto whom all creatures and actions preach his mortalitie? We ſee it by experience, that all earthly things haue their end: our yeares are limited, God hath meaſured out our months;Iob 14.1. the daies of our liues are dated, how long wee haue to liue: ſo that the firſt leſſon that we haue to learne, is to think of our end. We ſee that the longeſt day paſſeth, and the night ſucceedeth; how Sommer followeth Winter, and Winter Sommer: the Sunne hath both his riſing and his ſetting, his ſhining and his ſhading: the Spring couers and cloathes the ground with fruits; Sommer ripeneth them▪ Harueſt gathers them, and Winter ſpends them. Thus one thing followes another, and both one

and another paſſe ſwiftly to their end. The generation of one thing is the deſtruction of another; and the death of one thing is the life of another. Firſt is our generation, then our conception, after comes our birth in wonderfull weakeneſſe. The cradle at the firſt is our caſtle; when we are crept out of that, we come to a little ſtrength, yet long is the time ere we come to our ripeneſſe. And here, behold, we neuer continue in one ſtate; for as our ſtrength increaſed at the firſt, ſo by little and little it diminiſheth at the laſt: as Youth ſucceedeth childehood, and age youth, ſo childehood, youth, and age haue all their end.
                     Wee ſee by obſeruation that the freſheſt and ſweeteſt  flower ſoone fadeth: our garments waxe olde, be they neuer ſo gay: our buildings become ruinous, be they neuer ſo ſtately: and as our life is vpholden by the death of Gods creatures; ſo death ſhall be the end as well of vs as of them. The Sunne towards his ſetting, and the Moone towards her wayning haue dimmer beames and light. And this is the vniuerſall ſentence of the world, and Gods decree (which needes muſt ſtand) that all things flouriſhing ſhall fade, all things of force and might ſhall be feebled, all great things leſſened, and ſo by little and little (being weakened) ſhall at the laſt diſſolue into the firſt ſubſtance and matter whereof it came; as the cloudes in the skie, into dewes and ſhowers, Ice and Snow into water; all earthly things that are of the earth ſhall turne to earth againe, and they that are of the waters ſhall turne into the ſea:Gen. 3.19. So ſhall Adam (being duſt) to duſt againe returne with all his brood.
                     The law of Nature (eſtabliſhed amongſt all nations and  people of the world) is this, that all men come into the world with condition to retire out of it againe. He is no great man (ſaith one) that thinketh it a great matter for Trees and ſtones to fall, and for mortall men to die. I knew (ſaith Anaxagoras, hauing intelligence of the death of his ſonne) that hee was mortall and ſubiect to die: For as it is impoſſible for any man to die that liued not before;

ſo none can poſſibly liue that ſhall not die hereafter. Our life is as a garment that weares of it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe; for we weare out our life in liuing; the more we liue, the leſſe we haue to liue, and ſtill approach nearer death: whatſoeuer we are cloathed with, is a mortall and periſhing merchandiſe: our garments weare vpon our backs, and we in our garments; they are eaten with mothes, and wee with time. So in our meates (as in a looking-glaſſe) we may learne our owne mortalitie: for let vs put our hand into the diſh, and what doe we take, but the foode of a dead thing, which is either the fleſh of beaſts, or of birds, or of fiſhes, with which foode wee ſo long fill our bodies, vntill they themſelues be meate for wormes? All this we ſee by experience, we feele it and we taſte it daily: we ſee death (as it were) before our eyes: we feele it betwixt our teeth, and yet can wee not caſt our accompt, that we muſt die.
                     
                         There is no action without pauſe, no warre without truce; the weary workeman hath his day of reſt; Muſicke hath her ſtops, the Scriuen or his points: we do not alwayes eate and drinke, we doe not alwaies walke nor ſleepe; yea we doe not alwaies breath (although we cannot liue without breathing) but concerning our life, there is no truce, no pauſe, no reſt, no delay, but hourely, yea euery moment, in all places, and actions, we haſten to our end. Whether we eate or drinke, or ſleepe, or wake, or goe, or ſtand ſtill, the courſe of our life runnes out as the houre-glaſſe, and neuer reſts till it hath finiſhed his courſe. They which come hereafter ſhall march vpon our graues, as we doe now vpon the ſepulchers of our fathers; they ſhall remaine in our houſes, as we doe now in theirs that were before vs; they ſhall poſſeſſe our goods, our lands, our gold and ſiluer, our Iewels and treaſuries, as we at this day enioy theirs whom we haue ſucceeded.
                     
                         But I will haſten to an end (though the experience be endleſſe which confirmeth this point.) One rufully thus exclaimeth of Death: How quickly and ſodainely ſtealeſt

thou vpon vs? how ſecret are thy paths and waies? how doubtfull is thy houre? how vniuerſall is thy kingdome? The mighty cannot eſcape thy hands, the wiſe cannot hide themſelues from thee, and the ſtrong are weakened before thy face: Thou accounteſt no man rich, for that no man is able to pay the ranſome for his life: Thou goeſt euery where, thou ſearcheſt euery where, and thou art euery where. Thou withereſt the hearbes, thou waſteſt the windes, thou corrupteſt the aire, thou dryeſt the waters, thou changeſt the ages, thou altereſt the water, and ſuppeſt vp the ſea. All things doe decreaſe and diminiſh, but thou ſtill remaineſt and raigneſt in the world. Thou art the hammer that alwaies ſtriketh, the ſword that neuer blunteth, the ſnare that alwayes catcheth: Thou art the priſon whereinto euery man entreth, thou art the ſea wherein euery one drowneth, thou art the paine that euery one ſuffereth.
                     O cruell Death thou ſnatcheſt vs away in our ripeſt age, thou many times interrupteſt our beſt affaires, thou robbeſt vs in one houre of all the gaines we euer got. Thou cutteſt off ſucceſſion of kinreds, and families; thou bereaueſt kingdomes of their naturall heires; thou filleſt the world with widowes, and orphanes; thou breakeſt off the ſtudies of the learnedſt Clearks; thou ouerthroweſt the fineſt wits, and beſt conceits, in the ripeſt age: thou, ioyneſt the end with the beginning, without giuing place to the middle; thou art ſuch a meanes as God neuer created,

                         but thy comming was by the Diuels enuie and malice.
                     Now that wee may profit by this experience of our  mortall eſtate, and not forget our ſelues, ſo groſely vpon euery occaſion, as we doe; it is neceſſary to haue this holy Meditation ſtill fixed in our mindes, that ſince we liue, moue, and haue our being of God, that therefore our liues are not our owne, but lent vs for a time: we muſt remember that we are borne to die, and muſt liue to die, for the forgetfulneſſe of Death, and hope of long life makes

vs ſo ſecure and careleſſe, as that we deſire no other heauen but earth.Eſay 28.15. Many make a couenant with Death, and clap hands with the graue, hoping thereby to eſcape, or for a time to ſolace themſelues in the forgetfulneſſe of their latter end, and ſo bathe themſelues in their fleſhly pleaſures, and wallow (like fatted Swine in the filthy ſtie) of all vncleaneneſſe, ſtill following things apparant to their eyes, and neuer regarding the time to come, till death preuent them on a ſodaine, and ſummon them to appeare before their Iudge: So it commeth to paſſe that as they liued wickedly,Iob 8.14. they die moſt fearefully; their hope is as the winde, and their confidence like the cobwebbe: Death is a terrour and a torment both to their ſoule and body: and this is the reaſon they haue not learned to die; Death is ſtrange vnto them, he ſeemes an vgly monſter, they dare not once behold him.
                     
                         True it is that Death in it owne nature (as partly wee haue heard) is moſt terrible to behold, that the horror thereof amazeth all our ſenſes; yet he that is armed with faith, is well aſſured that it is ſent for his profit, to be as his hackney to carry and conuey him from earth to heauen, from paine to pleaſure, from miſery, vexation, griefe, and woe, to endleſſe mirth, melody, and ioyes vnſpeakeable with God for euer. And ſeeing the ſentence of death is gone forth againſt vs, and that our ſoules remaine in our bodies attending the day of execution; let vs deteſt to heare of our former wicked life, (as priſoners condemned to die) and humble our ſelues in prayer vnto God, reprouing the vanities of this wicked world, and aduertiſing our friends and familiars to doe the like, &c.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. VII. Of the miſerable life, and wretched ſtate of man, by the meanes of Sinne and Death.
                     
                        INfinite are the miſeries of mortall men: their ſinne brought in a ſea of euils; and iuſt is Iobs
                         complaint,Iob 14.1. 
                        that man borne of a woman is full of wretchedneſſe: from the day of his birth, till the day of his death, a whole armie of euils beſiege him. Tormented he is in his ſoule, and afflicted in his body:
                        Eſay 1.9. 
                        in euery part (from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the foote) he is full of infirmities, ſores, and maladies, no place is free: The firſt day of the life of man is a beginning of conflicts: Our ingreſſe and egreſſe, and whole progreſſe of life, is ſet about with ſeuerall ſignes of ſorrow.
                     The tender babe new borne, and not yet able to ſpeake  (ſaith Auguſtine) doth by his teares propheſie and foretell the manifold ſorrowes that are incident to this miſerable life of man. We enter this life with teares,
                           Auguſt. hom. 10. we paſſe it in toyle, and end it in ſorrow and torment. Great and little, rich and poore, not one in the whole world that can pleade immunitie from this condition. Life and miſery (ſaith one) are as two twinnes which were borne together, and muſt die together. From the wombe to our winding-ſheete our life is a warfare vpon earth; no age, no condition of life, no day, no night but brings his enemy with him, as well againſt the man of an hundred yeares olde, as againſt the babe new borne.
                     How full of ignorance is the time of our infancie? how light and wanton are wee, growing to be ſtriplings? how  raſh and headlong in the time of our youth? how heauy and vnweildy when we come to olde age? What is an infant but a bruit beaſt in the ſhape of a man? and what is a young youth, but (as it were) a wilde vntamed Aſſe-colt vnbridled? and what is an aged, heauy, and crooked old

man, but euen a ſacke and fardell ſtuffed with griefes and diſeaſes? He is forſaken of the world, his kinsfolk, friends, and acquaintance; his owne members and ſenſes faile him; yea, hee forſaketh (as it were) himſelfe, in that the very vſe of reaſon forſaketh him. Hee is accompanied with painfull aches, griefes, and diſeaſes: his company and conuerſation is comberſome in the Family where hee dwelleth. This is the marke (for ſooth) at which euery one ſhooteth, vpon which the eyes of all are fixed. This is the happy eſtate, ſo greatly deſired; this I ſay, is the end of the greedy ambition of long life.
                     Take thy Counters into thy hands, ſee what reckoning  thou canſt make of life: what is paſt frighteth thee with remembrance of it, becauſe ſo much of thy light is ſpent, what is preſent burdeneth thee with the weight of it, becauſe in ſweate and ſorrow thou doeſt waſte and ſpend thy time; what is to come troubleth thee with the vncertainty of it, leaſt the graue doe ſwallow thee before thou ſee it: what booteth it thee ſo vnſeaſonably to ripen thy cares for the tares of this life? To conclude, childehood is but a fooliſh ſimplicitie, Youth a vaine heate, Manhood a painefull carefulneſſe, and old age a noyſome languiſhing. Our playes are but teares, our pleaſures feauers of the minde, riches, are but rackes and torments, honours heauie vanities, our reſt vnreſty; and ſo paſſing from age to age, we paſſe from euill to worſe, from the leſſer to the greater. Thus one waue of trouble and affliction driueth vpon another, vntill wee be arriued at the hauen of Death. Here, life is dying, and death liuing; whiles it increaſeth, it decayeth: all this preſent life is but a wiſhing of the future, & a bewailing of the paſt, a loathing of that we haue, and a longing for that we haue not taſted, a vaine memory of the ſtate paſt, and a doubtfull expectation of the ſtate to come. Nothing in this life is certaine, nothing aſſured but the certainty and vncertainty of Death. If any man be long a dying, and paying Deaths debt. Nature (like a rigorous creditour, that will be paid at the

iuſt day) ſueth out an execution againſt her debtor,
                           Plato in dialogo contra mortem.
                         taking from one his ſight, from another his hearing, and both from ſome; and he that tarrieth longeſt in the world, ſhee foundreth, maymeth, and vtterly diſableth in his limbes.
                     Is not this a goodly place, where teares and cares make  their reſidence? where pale ſickneſſe, and ſad old age haue taken vp their habitation? and where of neceſſitie we muſt paſſe our daies with ſuch companions? Doe wee not ſee how many diſcommodities we vndergoe, and how ill this body of ours befitteth vs?
                           Senec. Epiſt. 121. One while wee complaine of our bellies, another time of our breaſts, and then of our throates; ſometimes our ſinewes, and then our feete, torment vs: Now we haue too much blood, anone too little. Thus are we haled and harried hither and thither; for ſo it ordinarily falleth out with him that dwelleth in another mans houſe: here teares ſooner faile vs, then iuſt cauſe of complaint: with teares and cries we entred,
                           Seneca de breuitate vite.
                         and with the ſame we muſt paſſe ouer and end our dayes.
                     What other thing is the body of mortall man, but a corrupt  and tainted veſſell, which infecteth the ſoule, and ſoureth incontinently whatſoeuer precious, or wholeſome liquor is powred into it? It is a filthy dunghill, couered with ſnow, faire without, and foule within: What channell is ſo filthy? what ſinke auoideth out ſuch loathſome geare, as doth mans body, by ſundry meanes & waies? The trees, hearbes, and many beaſts doe yeeld forth pleaſant ſmels, and wholeſome ſauours, onely Man doth yeelde moſt loathſome ſtuffe; ſo that he ſeemes to be no other thing then a fountaine of filthineſſe.
                           Iſidoras.
                         One fell a weeping that he was here a feeding vpon corruptible meate, being created to liue in the company of Angels, to feede on heauenly food.
                     What glaſſe is ſo brittle and ſubiect to knockes and breaking as is this body of ours? Sometimes the very aire  and heate of the Sunne is able to bereaue vs of life: It ſhall not neede to draw the ſword, or to vſe any weapon to

take it away, for the very aire and looke of an infected man is able to doe it. Conſider the ſtrength of this Caſtle, (wherein the treaſure of our life is kept) ſeeing the beholding of it a farre off is able to batter the wals thereof to the ground. Neither is it to be wondred that Man is ſo fraile and brittle of himſelfe, conſidering the moulde whereof he is made, being duſt: but rather we may admire, that being of ſuch fraile mettall and making (as hee is) yet can endure ſo long. Why is a Clocke ſo often diſordered, and out of frame? the reaſon is, becauſe it hath ſo many wheeles and points of curious worke, that though it be made of Iron, yet euery little thing is able to diſtemper it; but how much more nice is the artificiall compoſition of our body, and how much more fraile is the matter of our fleſh, then is the mettall of a Clocke? Why then ſhould we wonder if ſome one point or other (among ſo many peeces) haue ſome impediment, by meanes of which defect this clocke of our life is ſtopped & courſe ended? for what firmeneſſe can be in the matter of fleſh? or what ſtrength conſiſteth in ſuch a weake ſubiect?
                     
                         Now conſidering we liue in ſuch a fraile eſtate (as wee doe) our time is euer neere (ſaith Auguſtine) becauſe we are mortall;
                           Aug. de verbis Dom ſer. 1. nearer becauſe we liue among ſo many dangers. If we were of a glaſſie matter, our feare were the leſſe, for being kept from knockes, there were hope of continuance; but keepe we our ſelues as charily as wee can, we ſhall away. Doe we ouercome enemies without? diſeaſes within will alſo ſurpriſe vs? Can we auoide the ſtroake of weapons, the dart of Death we cannot ſhunne. Mortall man is like a ſnow-ball in the Sunne, his life is ſoone diſſolued: He is like an apple hanging on a tree, corrupted inwardly by wormes, though outwardly beautifull to the eye. Man is the bondſlaue of Death, as a gueſt in his dwelling, as a wayfaring man in his Inne, for a night, but quickly gone and forgotten: Whereſoeuer hee dwelleth, or whatſoeuer hee doth, Death continually waiteth for him, as a ſergeant at his gates. Oh miſerable life how many

deceiueſt thou? which when thou art knowne and learned, art nothing; when thou art exalted, art but as ſmoake? bitter to the wiſe, ſweet to the fooliſh: who ſo ſeeketh thee, knoweth thee not; who ſo knoweth thee, flyeth from thee.
                     It is reported that the Chamelion changeth himſelfe in  one houre into many and diuers colours; and the Sea called Euripus, for the often changing is accounted famous: the Moone hath likewiſe for euery day a ſeuerall forme and ſhape: But what Proteus was euer changed into ſo many formes as man altereth euery houre? ſometime hee is ſicke, ſometime ſound; ſometime angry, ſometime pleaſed, ſometime in hope, anone in deſpayre; hee willeth, and hee willeth not, &c. yea, many times hee knowes not himſelfe what hee would haue. Hee altereth and changeth euery houre; he toſſeth and tumbleth, hee rageth, and is as reſtleſſe as the troubled ſea. If hee be poore, hee liueth in trauell; if rich, hee is proud and licentions, &c. The Sea changeth not but when the windes turne contrary vnto it; but mans life, whatſoeuer the weather and ſeaſons are, eyther calme or windy, is continually troubled with alterations and ſtormes.
                     No man is contented with his owne eſtate, but deſireth to exchange it with another. The King feeleth the  weight of the Crowne, and deſireth to be a ſubiect for his ſafety: the Subiect, not content to be ruled, would be a King, &c. Thus men vexe themſelues, and like vnto ſicke men, doe nothing elſe but toſſe and tumble vpon their beds, thinking to finde the better eaſe and reſt, and yet are deceiued, ſeeing the cauſe of diſquietneſſe is within themſelues, which is their griefe and diſeaſe. Great and heauy is the yoake of the Sonnes of men, from the day of their birth, till the day of their death, the mother of all. Therefore Bernard was not afraid to ſay,
                           Bernard.
                         that he thought this life little better then the life of hell, were it not for the hope to attaine and come to the Kingdome of heauen.
                     
                        
                         Wee liue here as in an Ocean Sea of troubles, wherein wee can ſee no firme land one waue falling vpon another ere the former haue wrought all his malice and ſpight. Miſchiefes ſtriue for places, as if they feared to looſe their roomes, if they haſted not. So many good things as wee haue, ſo many euill threaten their loſſe and depriuation: beſides many reall and poſitiue euils that afflict vs. Our life is lent vs, as a ſhip, to tranſport vs to the hauen of reſt. From the Cradle to the Graue, we liue as it were vpon the ſtormy Sea, neuer long quiet and at reſt, but troubled and toſſed with the troubleſome waues of this world, which is a ſea of hurtfull bitterneſſe; it hath many waues of tribulations and tempeſts of temptations. Men are here floating like fiſhes, following and ſwallowing many hurtfull baites, to their bane and deſtruction, nay, deuouring one another, as the greater fiſhes doe the ſmall. It is a Sea ſwelling with pride, blewiſh with enuy, deepe and profound in couetouſneſſe, no Plummet being able to ſound the bottome of it; caſting out all that commeth in the way, through exceſſiue miſcarriage; hauing a mercileſſe man to ſwallow vp all it can get with inſatiable oppreſſion; very dangerous to ſaile in, by reaſon of the pernitious rockes of Deſperation and Preſumption; lofty through the reciprocall waues of mens paſſions, ebbing and flowing in inconſtancie; terrible ſalt through ſinne, very bryniſh are the waters thereof, not to be brooked of Gods Children. As in the ſea are all ſorts of fiſhes, and that great Leuiathan that hath his paſtime therein:
                           Aug. Tom. 2. in Pſal. 39. ſo there be in this world men of all natures and affections. Wee can name no creatures, of inclination neuer ſo cruell, filthy, and abhominable, but here will be a copeſmate of like qualitie and condition amongſt the crowd and company of men.
                     
                         This tranſitory world is a dungeon of ill ſauours, where vertue is poyſoned with the puddle-water of vice; where ranckor and deſpight chiefely raigne, and all goodneſſe is ouerwhelmed with malice; where Hereſie is an handmaide

to ſugred Hypocriſie; where ſmooth hatred, hidden ambition, ſmiling enuy, and wicked tyranny, ſhrowd themſelues. Our life is encountred with capitall enemies, Paine, Care, and Sorrow: Paine bids the body battell, Care continueth the skirmiſh, and Sorrow giueth the victory. This life is but a borrowed dreame of pleaſure, a viſion of ioy, a pageant of tranſitory delights.
                     What ſhould I ſpeake of the ſhortneſſe and ſwiftneſſe  of the ſame?Iob 9.25. 
                        It is like a Poſt (ſaith Iob) ſwiftly galloping away: yet ſometime hee that rideth ſo faſt, reſteth and breatheth: but our dayes paſſe away ſtill without ceaſing, till wee come to our graues. Our dayes paſſe away as the Barke of haſty meſſengers. A ſhip is not made to reſt, but continually to ſayle thorow the tempeſtuous ſea, and to ſet forward to the long deſired hauen: So are we not created to reſt, but to labour, (as the bird is made to flye) vntill by Death wee be brought home to our happy Port of reſt. As the ſhip paſſeth thorow the Sea, not leauing ſo much as any tracke in the waues; ſo our life goes away ſwiftly, and ſcarce leaues any ſigne thereof. A ſhip is ſubiect to many dangers; for it may be ſuncke by the leaſt leake, it may be ouerwhelmed with the waues, it may be ſhiuered againſt the rockes, it may periſh by tempeſts, it may be ſpoyled by Pirats: ſo is our life ſubiect to many perils, and may be taken from vs by a thouſand dangers. Our dayes flye away like an arrow, and wee are kept vnder as a fogge chaſed by the Sunne beames, and beaten downe by the heate thereof.
                     When the Sunne is at the higheſt, the ſhadowes are the  ſhorteſt; but when it beginnes to decline and ſet, then the ſhadowes well-neare change euery moment, vntill they ſlip away with the darkneſſe that enſues:Iob 9.26. So the dayes of all men paſſe away as a ſhadow at night, which appeares the longeſt when it is neareſt to an end. Our dayes goe as an Eagle to her prey: and what are men but the prey of Death,Eſay 40.6. which ſoareth after vs with an open mouth to deuoure vs? Wee are as flowers and graſſe;

and why doe wee not thinke (when wee walke in the fields) that Death in the hand of God, is like vnto a Sythe in the hand of a labourer, attending to cut vs downe euery houre? Wee gather flowers in our garden, and they fade preſently, and though wee leaue them there, they wither before the euening: and doe wee thinke to flouriſh alwayes, and to haue our Spring-time continuall in this world? Our dayes ſlide away like the winde, and fayle without hope; our bodies ebbe and turne backe like the courſe of waters; all the time which thou ſeeſt, flyes away with the time it ſelfe. Nothing remaines of all that wee ſee.
                           Ieronimus.
                         Euen I, while I am now writing (that all things are changed) am changed my ſelfe: See therefore our folly that wee ſhould ſo dearely loue a thing that ſo quickely leaues vs,
                           Seneca epiſt. 57. for euery moment of this life is the death of the other. There is nothing in vs that will not by and by be dead: onely our ſinnes liue; yea, reuiue and grow young againe in deſpight of Nature. Our Spring is fading, our Lampe is waſting, and the tyde of our life is drawing by degrees to a very low ebbe. Whatſoeuer we doe, our wheele whirles about apace; and we muſt learne to know that euery one of vs hath a poore ſoule to ſaue.
                     And not to forget the cares of this life: How doe they  ſwarme about vs, like the Flyes of Egypt? Of all the plagues this was moſt loathſome:Exod. 8.21.24. for they neuer ſuffered men to reſt, but the more they were beaten off, the more they came vpon them: ſo of all miſeries and vexations of mortall men, this is one of the greateſt, to be tormented with the cares of this life, which (as Flyes) by no deuice can be expelled. They ruſh vpon them in the morning as ſoone as they awake, they accompany them in the day, they follow them in the night, they forſake them not to bed, they let them from their ſleepe, they afflict them in their reſt, they trouble them in their dreames; and they are like to thoſe fierce and mercileſſe tyrants (threatned to the wicked) which ſhall giue them no reſt, neyther by day, nor night:Ier. 16.15.16. 
                        For I haue taken away my peace from this kinde of

people (ſaith the Lord) I haue taken away my mercy and compaſſion from them.
                     
                     The very bruite beaſts are fed and prouided for without  their care; but man is conſtrayned to ſweate day and night, and with ſorrow to torment himſelfe, by ſea and land, to get a poore liuing. Our dayes conſume away like the Spiders webbe, who laboureth night and day in ſpinning, waſting euen her bowels, and conſuming her ſelfe, to bring her web to an end: and what is her worke, but to make a fine and tender net to catch poore Flyes? So miſerable man doth toyle and trauell (like a hireling) both his body and minde, to catch the Butter-flyes of this world, euen needleſſe toyes and trifles, froath and vanities; and many times in the end doth come the bluſtering winde of Death, that carryeth away both web and workeman in a moment.
                     As our life is full of care, ſo it is fraught and ſet with many ſnares:Pſal. 11.6. 
                        God (ſaith Dauid) ſhall raine ſnares vpon ſinners;  teaching vs how infinite ſnares are ſet in this world, being as plentifull as the drops of raine. For euery thing almoſt is a deadly ſnare vnto a carnall man: Euery ſight that he ſeeth, euery word that he heareth, euery thought that hee thinketh: his youth, his age, his friends, his foes, his honour, his diſgrace, his riches, his pouertie, his ſolitarineſſe, his ſocietie, his proſperitie, his aduerſitie, his meate, his drinke, his apparell that hee weareth; all are ſnares to draw him to deſtruction that is not watchfull in the Lord.
                     Now to auoid theſe ſnares, that wee be not caught, there is no better refuge then that of the Birds, who by the benefit of their wings mount vp into the ayre, to flye aloft;Pro. 1.17. for the net is laid in vaine before the eyes of ſuch as haue wings and can flye. The Spyes of Iericho,
                        Pſal. 121.1. though many ſnares were laid for them, yet they eſcaped them all, for that they walked by hils, and hid them in mountaines.Ioſh. 2.22. If wee lift vp our eyes to the hils (with Dauid) whence all our aide and aſſiſtance commeth, to auoid the

dangers of this life:Pſal. 124.7. then likewiſe may wee ſay with him; Our ſoule is deliuered, as a bird, from the ſnare of the Fowler: If wee can truely ſay,Phil. 3.20. with S. Paul, Our conuerſation is in heauen, then ſhall wee little feare all theſe deceits and dangers vpon earth: for as the Fowler hath no hope to catch the birds, except he can allure them to his pitch, and to come downe to his lure: ſo hath the Diuell no way to intangle vs,Mat. 4.6. but to ſay (as hee did to Chriſt) Throw thy ſelfe downe; come to the baites which I haue laid, eate and deuoure them, tye thy affections to earthly things, &c. But King Dauid was paſt them all,Pſal. 73.25. when he ſaid to God; Whom haue I in heauen, but thee? and there is none in earth which I deſire before thee,
                        Phil. 3.8. 
                        &c. And ſo was Paul when hee accounted all things dung;2 Cor. 10.3. for though he liued in the fleſh, yet he walked not after the fleſh.
                     
                        
                        I haue a whole army of traitors within mee (ſaith Auguſtine) who vnder colour of friendſhip are mine enemies:
                        
                           Lib. Med. cap. 4. 
                        and yet behold, with them haue I liued from my youth vp, them haue I pleaſed, them haue I beleeued, as the friends whom I loued, as the Maſters whom I obeyed, the Lords whom I ſerued, the Counſellors whom I truſted, &c. That the Adamant draweth Iron vnto it, is a ſecret in Nature: but for the World and Fleſh to draw vs, is a matter as naturall as for the water of a riuer to runne downe the channell, and as for a Coach to runne downe a hill: for being naturally giuen to the corruptions of the fleſh, wee neede no ſoliciting; the onely ſight of the thing we loue is ſufficient to hale vs forward. As the wanton harlot allures her louers, the baite vpon the hooke the fiſhes, the call of the Fowler the fooliſh Birds; ſo is this World and Fleſh with their baites and allurements. They are like a violent ſtreame that carryes away the higheſt and talleſt trees not ſufficiently rooted: yea, the beſt men are rightly reſembled to thoſe that liue among Colliers and Millers, who hardly can ſhunne defiling and deforming of coale and meale.
                     
                         The Diuell ſetteth before our eyes enticing pleaſures, that by the ſight of them hee may ſupplant our chaſtitie,

hee tempteth our eares with the ſweetneſſe of Muſicke▪ that hee may weaken our Chriſtian ſtrength; hee moueth our tongues by bitter words, and by iniurious deeds prouoketh our hands to fight and ſlay; hee offereth vnrighteous gaine to induce vs to fraud,
                           Cipr. tract. 10. de Zel

                              .
                         and pernicious profits to kindle couetouſneſſe in our ſoules; hee promiſeth temporall honours wherby to defeat vs of celeſtiall ioyes; he ſheweth falſhood that hee may ſeduce vs from the truth; hee practiſeth cunning in time of peace, and violence in perſecution. In this wicked world who can liue peaceably among ſo many enemies of peace, where the mother is againſt the daughter, and the daughter againſt the mother; yea, manifold are our foes in our owne families; yea, in our owne ſelues and ſoules: Reaſon againſt the Will, and Will againſt the Reaſon; yea, (which is more) euery man is two men, the Fleſh againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh; the Law of the members againſt the Law of the minde? And this conflict is not for a time, but ſo long as wee continue in this body of ſinne.
                     Perfect peace here we cannot poſſibly haue, ſeeing the  Fleſh which euer rebelleth, is in this world, as one that is planted in his owne Countrey: Caſt downe this enemy may be, caſt out hee cannot be, vntill this mortall hath put on immortalitie:1 Cor. 15.53. yet we muſt endeuour that though it be inhabitant, yet that it be not regnant. The Fleſh is ſtrong, yet Grace is ſtronger in Gods Children, to ſubdue the rigour thereof: the Fleſh is as the elder,Gen. 25.23. Rom. 9.12. Grace as the yonger; but in this Gods Children haue a promiſe alſo that the elder ſhall obey the younger. Wee may not thinke our ſelues ſafeſt, when wee ſeeme to be freeſt from the buffettings of Sathan: for, bearing in our bodies a diuided Kingdome,Rom. 7. betweene the Fleſh and the Spirit (repreſented vnto vs in the wreſtling of Rebeccaes twinnes in her wombe) if wee haue peace with God wee ſhall haue warre with the Dragon; and hauing forſaken Egypt,
                        Gen. 25.22. 
                        Reu. 12.47. yet in the way to our heauenly Canaan, wee ſhall haue a ſpirituall Pharaoh, with his Captaines, like Graſſehoppers,Exod. 14.9.10. to feed

vpon vs: yea, the libertie which wee haue in Chriſt, the corruption of our heart will labour to inuert to voluptuouſneſſe; the ſweetneſſe which wee taſte in his word, the vanity of our mindes will endeuour to ouer-caſt with drowſineſſe; the Faith which we ground on his promiſes, the ſubtiltie of the Serpent will ſeeke to vndermine with doubtfulneſſe; the conſcience wee make to offend, the luſts of our fleſh will contend for to couer with hypocriſie; the deteſtation wee haue of ſinne, the concupiſcence of our eyes will ſtriue to ouer-reach with prophaneneſſe; and the intereſt wee haue to heauen, the pride of our liues will perſwade vs to change for trifles.
                     
                         Being freed from outward warre, ciuill and inteſtine ariſeth vp againſt vs: our Affections againſt Reaſon and Will Earth troubleth Heauen, and the World in our ſelues (although wee greatly ſhunne it, doe what wee can) will haue a pauilion and tent in our hearts. Yea, thoſe oftentimes (who with tragicall and vehement words ſeem moſt to deteſt it) are yet made ſo blinde with the glory thereof, that the very ſhadow of ambition affecteth them. Many (I dare boldly ſay) ſeeme to defie the World, which meet and welcome the ſame with the kindeſt embracings. This masking World (in her ſtrange diſguiſed vizour) not ſeldome flouriſheth among ſuch as ſeeme moſt to ahhorre her. For (alas) wee are reſident in the World, and the World in vs, ſo that wee cannot be free from the World, except wee depart from our ſelues; and what is this departure but death? Some in flying the contagion of others are corrupted of themſelues, and in with-drawing from the ſocietie of men, yet deny not the olde man poſſeſſing them. In the great deluge of this life Gods Children are toſſed with raging ſtormes on euery ſide, where no good footing or high place can be found for the Doue of Chriſt to reſt her ſelfe:Gen. 8.9. Here is no ſure peace, nor ſecure quietneſſe; but warres on euery ſide, and in all places contention and deadly foes.
                     
                         The tempeſtuous ſea torments vs, wee are grieued at

the heart, and deſirous to vomit and to be diſcharged thereof; we remoue out of one ſhip to another; from a greater to a leſſe: wee promiſe vnto our ſelues reſt in vaine, they being alwayes the ſame windes that blow, the ſame waues that ſwell, the ſame humours that are ſtirred, to all there is no other port, no other meanes of tranquilitie, but onely death. See the fooliſhneſſe of the world, and the infirmity of our fleſh.Ioh. 16.20.22. When God ſaith trouble ſhall come; they ſay, wee would haue eaſe: when God ſaith, be merry and reioyce in trouble, wee lament and mourne, as though wee were caſt-awayes. But this fleſh (which is neuer merry with vertue, nor ſorry with vice, which neuer laugheth with grace, nor weepeth with ſinne) holdeth faſt with the world, and giueth God the ſlip. Thus wee may ſee our wretched eſtate in the fleſh, ſtill croſſing God and the ſaluation of our ſoules. All our affections and wils, (with the whole force of Nature) helpeth forward our deſtruction, fightings without, and terrours within, World▪ Fleſh, and Diuell,2. Cor. 7.5. ioyne together with Death, for our damnation.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII. Of the power, ſtrength, and ſting of Death, by meanes of the Law, whoſe nature is here vnfoulded.
                     
                        THe originall of Death we haue heard, as  alſo what it is, who be ſubiect to it, with the fearefull eſtate wherein they ſtand. Now let vs further obſerue, that as the Diuell, and man together brought in Death by ſinne: ſo it now being entred is become the very kingdome of the Diuell, wherein hee raigneth. By Death he triumphed ouer man, whom hee ſeduced, holding him faſt in his owne fetters, and ſhackles of ſin, which himſelfe firſt found out, and ſo leadeth him as his ſlaue, and ruleth ouer him as his head: for God did

renounce man (although hee created him) and caſt him off by meanes of ſinne, whom firſt he had made like vnto himſelfe. In that men die, it proues they had ſinned; and ſinne proues there is a law, which law being broken, bringeth Death:Rom. 6.23. 
                        for the wages of ſinne is Death.
                     
                     
                         Now to conuince ſinfull man the better of this his curſed eſtate, God renewed his law (firſt ingrafted in his nature,Exod. 31.18. but blotted out by his fall) in Tables of Stone, to ſhew the hardneſſe of his heart, that ſo as in a glaſſe hee might ſee his fearfull fall.Iam. 1.23. For (amiddeſt the heapes of all other ſins) pride ſo poſſeſſed his heart, that although he was nothing elſe but ſin, yet ſtil he deemed himſelfe as innocent and righteous: He was ſo blinded in his corruption, that he knew not ſinne in his colours, vntill the law deſcried it. And this is the common error of all his lynage, that without the publiſhing of the law, wee had not knowne our ſinne.Rom. 7.7. 
                        I knew not ſinne (ſaith Paul) but by the Law: I had not knowne luſt, except the law had ſaid thou ſhalt not luſt: but ſinne tooke occaſion by the Law,
                        Rom. 3.20. 
                        and wrought in me all manner of luſt: ſo ſinne by the Law grew out of meaſure ſinnefull.
                     
                     Such is the corruption of mans nature that it moſt eagerly  deſireth things, that are moſt ſtraightly denied, which if they had not beene mentioned, ſhould not ſo much as haue beene dreamed of. For though the flame of concupiſcence be reſtrained by the damme and wall of Gods law; yet is it not dryed vp in our mortall nature. When the law was giuen to man in whom there is no grace,Rom. 7.8. ſinne abounded three waies: firſt, ſeeing the law of God giuen vnto him as an helpe, ſinne laboureth to turne it to his hurt, whom it ſecurely before poſſeſſing, leſſe aſſaulted: ſecondly, Man naturally deſireth liberty and freedome, and flyeth ſeruitude and bondage; by nature mans minde is croſſe and peeuiſh, and is ſwayed to contraries. Stolne waters are the ſweeteſt,Pro. 9.17. & hid bread is pleaſant: So that by the prohibitions of the law (charity in man being decayed) the deſire of euil increaſed; which once increaſed, made the things forbidden by the law more ſweet and

pleaſant: Thirdly, for that the inhibition of euill things puts them more in remembrance of the things forbidden, which very remembrance to nature corrupted, is a prouoker and ſtirrer vp of filthy luſt and deſire.
                     Againe, in that ſinne abounded, when the law entred, it is to be vnderſtood by an accidentall conſequent: for God ſent not his law in cruelty and rigour, but vpon good aduiſe and ſound iudgement. Sometime man ſeemeth to be whole and is ſicke, and becauſe he feeleth not the ſickneſſe, hee ſeeketh not for the Phyſition; but the diſeaſe increaſing with the griefe, the Phyſition is ſought, by whoſe meanes the ſicke and ſore body may be cured: So the law was giuen to ſuch as were infirme and ſicke in ſinne, that ſo they may ſeeke to the Phyſitian Ieſus Chriſt to be healed. Againe, it entred, the better to diſcouer ſinne, which without the light thereof would haue lurked in ſecret. And as the beames in the Sunne are not euill, though they deſcry and lay open things deformed or filthy, which the wicked deſire, and as the knowledge of Phyſicke is not to be condemned, which acquainteth vs with poyſon and venemous things, that are in themſelues dangerous, and abuſed by ſome to their owne deſtruction: So the law is not euill in it ſelfe,Rom. 7.12. 1. Tim. 1.8. though it be abuſed as an occaſion of euill to corrupt and wicked men.
                     Without the law ſinne is dead, not as though there was  no ſinne in the world before the publiſhing of the law;Rom. 7.8. for euen the Gentiles themſelues which had not the law written, ſhewed the effect of the law in their hearts (the conſcience alſo bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts accuſing one another, or excuſing▪) and therefore being conuinced in their ſoules of ſinne without the Law written,Rom. 2.15. are a law vnto themſelues; and ſinning without law, ſhall periſh without the law written, by the law of nature, that was grafted in their hearts. This is confirmed by many Morall vertues, which they naturally followed, and by many vices which they naturally hated. This knowledge of the light of Nature (though vnperfect) yet is ſufficient to confound

them; albeit ſinne (indeede) was then hidden in reſpect (which is the meaning of the Apoſtle) and their beſt knowledge of the Law ouer-ſhadowed, and well-nigh blotted out, that ſinne could not appeare in his nature.
                     
                         But when the Law was renewed, ſinne that ſeemed to be dead, reuiued and ſhewed it ſelfe: All the ſpots did then appeare, which before were darkened, by the ignorance of Gods Law, which Man gained by his fall. The Law then conuinced vs of ſinne, and reuealed our nakedneſſe, which our figge leaues had hidden;Gen. 3.7. it opened the inward man with all his concupiſcence; it ſhewed vs our ſhame and confuſion, our vgleſome ſhape, moſt monſtrous to beholde, how wee were tranſformed from the image of God, to the ſimilitude of the Diuell: It put vs in remembrance of our diuine nature which we had loſt; it ſhewed vs hell, and the wrath of God, nothing but condemnation appeared by it: It let vs vnderſtand how farre we were led from God; how all things within vs and without vs, were corrupted and out of courſe: It painted our God in his nature, according to his moſt pure holineſſe and iuſtice; how he requireth all our hearts, all our ſoules, all our mindes, all our ſtrength, that is to ſay, the whole man and euery part of him in his ſeruice.Deut. 6.5. Mat. 22.37.39. The leaſt ſinne could not ſo ſhroude it ſelfe, but the law, diſcouer it, not condemning onely all our outward acts,Exod. 20.17. Rom. 7.7. but giuing ſentence againſt all our wicked thoughts; yea, all our idle motions without conſent.
                     
                         And therefore ſince all fleſh created of God is corrupted, ſo that all the imaginations of mans heart are onely euill continually,Gen. 6.5. ſince all men by the law are conuinced of ſinne, all included vnder ſinne, and ſubiect vnto the ſame guilt of condemnation;Gal. 3.16. ſince by the Law commeth the knowledge of ſinne, which leaueth euery man without excuſe; ſince it was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, and that our ſins might more appeare and abound, therefore it is called to the vnregenerate man,Act. 15.10. an importable yoke,

the occaſion of ſinne, the law of ſinne and of wrath,Rom. 7.8. the adminiſtration of condemnation, the oldneſſe of the letter,Rom. 8.2. & 4 15 which cannot giue life, but pronounce all our workes accurſed. The law is a hammer,2. Cor. 3.7.9. not only to bruiſe the conſcience, but to breake it into powder, which if it be not done, we ſhall neuer haue the ſpirit of adoption to ſeize vpon vs; The law commandeth, but giueth no power to obey;Rom. 7.6. Rom. 8.15. It is but a dead letter,2. Cor. 3.6. Rom. 7.6. and hath but a dolefull and dreadfull ſound, vntill the ſpirit come and arme vs with power to performe what the law requireth.
                     And now behold the ſtrength and ſting of Death. How  did Death enter? by ſinne. How did ſin appeare, and what is the ſtrength of the ſame? euen the law of God, which giueth ſentence of condemation againſt all fleſh, and leaueth not one iuſtified in Gods ſight: And yet notwithſtanding all this, the law of God is holy, iuſt, and good,Deut. 11.26.27.28. opening vnto vs his very will, which is goodneſſe it ſelfe, ſetting a bleſſing before our eyes, as well as a curſe. It was not contrary to our nature before it was corrupted, but agreeable to the image of man, in which hee was firſt created; it ſheweth the very perfect patterne of true obedience, what is agreeable to God and his nature, how much he hateth ſinne, and delighteth in goodneſſe; it offereth both life and death, life to the obayers; death to the breakers: Therefore let vs all glorifie God in this behalfe, let euery mans mouth be ſtopt from accuſing God or his law; let vs confeſſe againſt our ſelues our manifold ſinnes, and ſay vnto him: Shame and confuſion appertaineth vnto vs:
                        Dan. 9.7. 
                        Death and condemnation are our due: Thy heauy anger, wrath and hell be our deſerts, and thou (O bleſſed God) art iuſt, righteous, good and gracious in all thy doings for euer. Let vs thus (I ſay) giue ſentence againſt our ſelues, that God may be iuſtified and praiſed, euen before the moſt wickedeſt men when he is iudged.
                     Well then let vs beare in minde, that God is not rigorous in puniſhing ſinfull man with euerlaſting Death, by reaſon of his innumerable ſinnes conuinced by his Law,

and that Gods infinite iuſtice thus broken and diſobeyed, could not otherwiſe be anſwered of man, but by the infinite ſuſtaining of eternall Death. And now I pray you marke the whole power of Sathan, and kingdome of the Diuell: firſt hee fighteth and warreth with temptations (which are as darts to wound our ſoules to Death) which if we reſiſt not, being ſo tempted, but yeeld to ſinne, then comes the Law againſt vs with his force, and by vertue of the Law Death entreth and triumpheth; for the ſting of Death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law: for it ſheweth vs hell,1. Cor. 15.56. (which is the pallace of Death) and leaueth vs in perdition. See (I ſay) what Prince Death hath, and what ſtrong ſouldiers to keepe his kingdome, to wit, the Diuell himſelfe, ſinne, law, wrath of God, and all to vphold it.
                     
                         Wherefore it is no maruell if the remembrance of Death be bitter vnto many, and that they abhorre and hate it: I ſay, it is no wonder, if all their ioynts doe quake and tremble, yea, and ſhake a ſunder; ſince the horrour thereof made the ſonne of God to pray againſt it,Luk. 2.40.44. to ſweate drops of blood for the agony of it, and to cry out to his father (as a man forlorne) why haſt thou forſaken me?
                        Mat. 27.46. Neither was this ſo ſtrange a wonder to ſee the ſonne of God ſo amaſed at Death; for it ſet both Diuell, law, ſinne, hell, graue, and wrath of God againſt him: All theſe were armed to ouerthrow him, and any or the leaſt of theſe without this our Captaine Chriſt, will quite deſtroy vs.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IX. Of euerlaſting Death in particular, and of the horrour thereof.
                     
                        GReat and heauie was the tribute that the eternall  God (as a moſt iuſt iudge) impoſed vpon man for ſinne. The Death of the body is fearefull in our eyes, when wee conſider with our ſelues, how ſtrangely the condition thereof is altered,

when the body that a fleſhly man makes ſo much of, his belly which he eſteemeth for his God, his mouth for whoſe delight the ſea and land ſufficed not, his fleſh that was wont to be cloathed with coſtly garments of ſilke and gold, curiouſly wrought, ſhall now ſodainely be haled into a filthy hole and pit, where it ſhall be trod vpon, yea, and eaten with wormes; where in ſtead of gorgeous apparrell, he muſt now onely enioy his winding ſheete, and inſtead of his perfumes and maskes, filthy fauours and rottenneſſe and in lieu of his varietie of delicate diſhes, and ſeruing men to attend him, to haue a company and infinite number of crawling vermine, to feede vpon him: What man I ſay now liuing and enioying ſence and reaſon, but will maruell to thinke of the baſe condition that ſo noble a creature comes vnto? who in his life time had no fellow nor equall? Is it not a wonder that ſo excellent a myrrour of nature ſhould come to ſuch a diſhonourable, baſe, and loathſome eſtate?
                     The euerlaſting Iudge knew well enough what penance  he enioyned ſinfull man, when he ſaid, thou art duſt, and to duſt thou ſhalt returne: but what is this death and diſgrace of the body, to the death and deformity of body and ſoule in hell? it is but as the byting of a flea to the ſtinging of a Scorpion; a ſhadow to the ſubſtance. If diſeaſes (which doe but make the way to death) be ſo dreadfull, what muſt the end and perfection of diſeaſes be? ſince as the diſeaſes are the malidies of the body, ſo Death it ſelfe the maladie of diſeaſe? for there are that feare not ſo much to die, as to be dead. If the pang be bitter, yet it is but ſhort, but the comfortleſſe ſtate of the dead, ſtrikes ſome farre deeper, that could well be reſolued otherwiſe for the act of their paſſage. The very not being is ſufficiently abhorred of nature: if Death had no more to make it fearefull, but thoſe that haue liued vnder ſuch ſhining beames of light, to ſhew them the darke dungeon of hell (after their ſtraight paſſage thorough the gates of Death) and ſuch as haue learned that Death is not onely horrible for their not being here, but for their abode and being infinitely

and eternally miſerable in the world to come, not ſo much for the diſſolution of life, as the beginning of torment: ſuch I ſay, cannot but extreamely feare to die, and helliſhly tremble to be dead indeede.
                     
                         But if it be ſuch paines to die, what ſhall be the torture and torment to be euer dying, and neuer dead? And if the ſtrayning of one Ioynt can ſo afflict vs (as experience teacheth) what ſhall the racking of the whole body and tormenting of the ſoule be, whoſe animation alone maketh the body feele and complaine of ſmart? And if our momentany ſufferings ſeeme long, how long ſhall that be which is eternall? If ſo extreme ſorrowes be incident indifferently to Gods deareſt children vpon earth, to driue them ſometimes within the ſight of deſpaire, what ſhall thoſe be that are reſerued onely for thoſe that hate the Lord and are hated of him? There is nothing great that hath not an end (as it is in the prouerbe) but to be tormented in moſt horrible paines in all the parts of body and ſoule without remorſe, that ſhall neuer haue end, nor eaſe, nor mitigation, nor declination, nor change, nor alteration, nor hope of end in the ſufferer or tormentour, this euill is beyond all the thoughts of man: this is the dying life, and liuing Death, full of endleſſe horrour and torment, where the damned are not before Death, or after Death, but alwayes in Death, & therfore neuer liuing, nor euer dead, but alwaies dying, and it ſhall be neuer be worſe to the wicked in Death, then when their Death it ſelfe ſhall be without Death.
                     
                         And it is great iuſtice in God that they neuer want the paine of hell, who all their life time had all their pleaſure ſet on ſinne: Who if they could, faine would haue liued for euer, but neuer left their ſinne: for he that forſaketh not his ſin in this life, ſeemeth alwaies for ſinnes ſake to liue euer. From this Death therefore there is no returne; it groweth by continuance, and by continuing groweth: from hell there is no redemption; It is a gulfe deuouring all things that come into it, neuer reſtoring any thing againe; It is the pit of perdition, and houſe of deſpaire;

It is the ſecond Death farre exceeding the firſt beyond all conceits of man; for what life haue the damned where there is nothing but immortality of torments and euill? where there is nothing but the fellowſhip of Diuels and the damned? where there is fire vnquenchable, to which ours is but Ice? Continuall burning there is the leaſt: yet this is not all, for though the euils be moſt great and continuall, yet here hope bringeth ſome eaſe (as a little Starre in the night,) but in hell with thoſe greateſt torments, and horrour of euils, is the greateſt deſpaire, without hope of any eaſe or recouery. This horror is moſt horrible, far exceeding all worldly ſorrow and feare; better it were neuer to haue beene, then not to be deliuered from that dying life, which is indeede an immortall death.
                     In this life all the paines which fall vpon man are but  particular, and not vniuerſall, as we ſee one man pained in his eyes, another in his backe, another in his teeth, another in his belly, &c. which particular paines notwithſtanding ſometime are ſo extreame, as that life is not able to reſiſt them, and a man would not endure them ſo long for the gaining of many worlds. But ſuppoſe now a man were tormented in all the parts of his body together, and at once, in his head, eyes, tongue, teeth, throat, ſtomacke, belly, backe, heart, ſides, thighes, and in all his ioynts beſides, without eaſe or intermiſſion; what thing could be more miſerable then this? what ſight more lamentable? yet conſider further what difference there is betweene abiding theſe paines for a weeke, or for euer, and all eternitie; in ſuffering of them vpon a ſoft bed, or vpon a burning gridiron and boyling furnace; amongſt a mans friends comforting him, or amongſt the Furies of hell tormenting him.
                     Now therefore if a man would endure a great deale of labour, rather then abide the one in this life, how carefull and diligent ſhould we be to hate our ſinnes, and ſerue the Lord while we liue, rather then to incurre the other tortures and torments in the life to come? The wicked ſhall

be tormented for euer; ſo long as God is God, ſo long ſhall they burne in hell, neyther ſhall the tormenter nor the tormented dye, but both liue for euer and together eternally. Oh (ſaith a godly Father) if a ſinner damned in hell▪ did know that hee had to ſuffer thoſe torments there, no more thouſands of yeares then there be ſands of the ſea, and piles of graſſe on the ground, or no more thouſand millions of ages, then there be creatures in heauen and in earth; hee would greatly reioyce thereof, and comfort himſelfe with this poore cogitation, that once yet his torments would haue an end: but now (ſaith hee) this word (Neuer) breakes his heart when hee thinketh on it, and that after a hundred thouſand millions of worlds there ſuffered, he hath as farre to his end as he had at the entrance: for no water can quench this fire, no time can end theſe torments.
                     
                         Death in it ſelfe to the vnregenerate man is the very gate of hell, and wicket-dore of damnation: for whomſoeuer it findeth vnrenued by Gods Spirit (lying ſtill in the filth of ſinne) it ſendeth them ſtraight to Gods Iudgement ſeat for ſpeedy vengeance: ſuch therefore cannot chooſe but loathe and abhorre it, being the meſſenger of Gods wrath, the wages for their ſinne, and the fearefull fore-runner of their eternall damnation to enſue. For ſhall it hale them forward to hell (like an executioner) and they not diſlike it? Shall it arreſt them, as a Serjeant, to appeare before their Iudge, and they not regard it? Fearefull no doubt are their fits and furies before their end, and grieuous and vnſpeakable are their pangs before they come to the full poſſeſſion of their endleſſe paines. And what a ſorrowfull day will death be to ſuch, when Iuſtice ſhall ſet ſuch a fyne vpon their heads, that will for euer decay their former wealthy eſtate in the world, and leaue them in a deſperate caſe?
                     
                         It is no maruell therefore that wicked reprobates doe ſo ſhake and tremble at the remembrance of death: for there is cauſe of more feare then they can feare. For the

power of Gods wrath (which now in death the wicked and vngodly men preſently expect to feele) cannot be feared as it ought; For who knoweth the power of thy wrath?
                        Pſal. 90.11. There is no feare, no ſuſpition, no thought, which may ſufficiently expreſſe the terrour of it. Horrendum eſt,
                        Hebr. 10.31. it is a horrible thing, (ſo ſaith the Author to the Hebrewes) but how fearefull no creature can tell, but they that feele it, and lye vnder it in the flames of hell as Diues did.Luke 16.23. Aske no queſtion (ſaith one) concerning them that periſh, concerning the death of the vngodly: ſeeke not, neither enquire, there is no comfort to be giuen vnto it.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. X. The fearefull condition of the reprobate and all wicked men, without Chriſt.
                     
                        WHen the wicked and vngodly men ſhall ponder  with themſelues (vpon the knowledge of the former poynts) how ſinfull they are, and how by meanes of their vnrepentant hearts, they are holden in the cords of their ſinne, and as malefactors apprehended and found guilty, are ready to be haled to deaths priſon, there to lye vntill their arraignment and appoynted time of iudgement ſpeedily to be executed vpon them. They cannot chooſe (hauing the ſentence of condemnation written in their conſciences) but tremble and quake at the remembrance thereof. If the hand-writing againſt Balthaſar once read vpon the wall, cauſed his very heart to ſhake,Dan. 5.6. and his knees knock together (when hee heard that God had numbred his dayes, and weighed him in the Ballance,) how fearefully ſhall the vngodly be affected with the continuall expectation of the wrath and vengeance of God, aſſuredly decreed, ſodainly and in a moment, to fall vpon them?
                     And albeit they ſtriue to put away the euill day from  their thoughts and cogitations; yet haue they many fits

and feuers of feare, euen in the middeſt of their delights. When Pharaoh the proud Tyrant,Exod. 12.30.31. had hardened his heart, and boaſted exceedingly againſt the people of God; yet he no ſooner ſaw the death of the firſt borne, but he feared and trembled as the leaues in the Wilderneſſe. There is indeede a way (as Solomon ſaith) that a man thinketh ſtraight and pleaſant,Prou. 14.12. when yet the iſſues thereof lead to death: but what pleaſure is that, and what delight? Surely in that laughter the heart is ſorrowfull,Verſe 15. and that mirth doth end in heauineſſe. True it is that ſuch men ſtrengthen themſelues, and ſtriue to vanquiſh feare, ſometimes with one pleaſure, and ſometimes with another; but if they would violently caſt it out (as the Cannon doth her ſhot) yet would it euermore returne againe, and vexe their heart.
                     
                         And though they would neuer ſo faine haue their conſcience ſeared (as with a glowing Iron) to make them ſenſleſſe; yet ſometimes it awakeneth them as out of a ſleep, and then they ſee moſt fearefull ſights of horrour and torment: and when they feele it leaſt, their ſtate is no better then that of the ſtalled Oxe,Prou. 7.22. not knowing (being ſo fat) that then he is the fitteſt for the ſlaughter. All their life is a miſerable bondage in feare and terrour of their iuſt condemnation to enſue. They haue the ſpirit of ſlauery and feare (being the children of the handmaid Hagar) borne in the bondage of her wombe,Gal. 4.24.25. they dwell in the Deſart of Ambia, and are in mount Sinai, where is the burning of fire, and blackneſſe, and darkneſſe, and tempeſt,Exod. 19.16. & 20.19. Heb. 12.18. &c. and ſound of Trumpet, at which they tremble, for they are without Chriſt, and therefore muſt needes be in the horrour and feare of death all their dayes.
                     And though through the cuſtome of ſinne they come  to a ſlumbring ſpirit, and are caſt into a numbneſſe of conſcience, brawned through a ſenſleſſe blockiſhneſſe, as men hewed out of hard Oakes, or grauen out of Marble, hauing flinty hearts and adamant ſoules, altogether deſtitute of true feeling of their ſinnes and feare of God; yet

when the Lord ſhall let looſe the cord of their conſciences, and ſhall ſet their ſinnes before their face, ſome of them depart this life like bruitiſh Swine, and others of them ſurcharged with ſinne, doe end their dayes like barking dogges.Eſay 66.24. 1 Tim. 4.2. Eſay 57.20. Heb. 10.27. The ſting of an ill conſcience is called a worme that neuer dyeth, a ſearing with an hot iron, a ſea that alwayes rageth, a violent fire to deuoure the aduerſary.
                     An euill conſcience is a heauy burden, it will make the  wicked grieue at the loſſe of that he neuer loued, for vertue hath this triumph ouer vice, that they which hate her moſt ſhall be grieued at her abſence.
                           Tully, de natura deorum.
                         If a man languiſh in ſickneſſe, (ſo his heart be whole) his ſickneſſe doth not ſo much grieue him: if he be reproached (ſo he be precious in the ſight of God and his Angels) what loſſe hath hee? but if his ſoule be diſquieted, who dareth meete with the wrath of the Lord of hoaſts? Who can put to ſilence the voyce of deſperation? Who can make agreement with Hell and Diuels? In all other afflictions a man may haue ſome comfort againſt ſinne, but this is euer accompanied with the accuſation of ſinne; then a man ſuſpecteth all his wayes, feareth all his ſinnes, hee knowes not what ſinne to beginne with: And where all other euils purſue men but to death, an ill conſcience not cured, endeth not in death, but becommeth eternall.
                     It is the profeſſion of ſinne (although fayre ſpoken at  the entrance) to be a perpetuall make-bate betwixt God and man; yea, betwixt a man and himſelfe: and this enimitie (though it doe not continually ſhew it ſelfe (for that the conſcience is not clamorous, but ſomewhile is ſilent, otherwhiles with ſtill murmurings bewrayeth her miſlikes) yet it doth euermore worke ſecret vnquietneſſe to the heart. The guilty man may haue a ſeeming truce, a true peace hee cannot haue. The galled ſpirit doth after the manner of ſicke Patients, ſeeke refreſhing in varietie, and after many toſſed and tumbled ſides, complaines of remedileſſe & vnabated torment. Such a one may change

his bed-chamber, and remoue his place, but not his paines; his furies euer attend him, are euer within him, and as parts of himſelfe. And what auayles it to ſeeke outward reliefe when thou haſt thy executioner within thee? If thou couldeſt ſhift from thy ſelfe, thou mighteſt haue hope of eaſe, for thou ſhalt neuer want frettings ſo long as thou haſt thy ſelfe; yea, what if thou wouldeſt run from thy ſelfe, thy ſoule may flye from thy body, thy conſcience, will not flye from thy ſoule, nor ſinne from thy conſcience, the conſcience leaues not where the Fiends beginne, but both ioyne together in torture.
                     
                         Some are of ſo hard and obdurate fore-heads, that in their reſolution they can laugh their ſinne out of countenance; they haue ſo long and able gorges, that in their conceit they can ſwallow and digeſt any manner of ſinne without complaint. But beleeueſt thou that ſuch a mans heart laughes with his face? Will not hee dare to be an hypocrite, that durſt be a villaine? Theſe Glow-wormes (when a night of ſorrow comes) make a lightſome and fiery ſhew of ioy, when if thou vrge them, thou findeſt nothing but a cold and crude moyſture. Such as count it no ſhame to ſinne, yet count it a ſhame to be checked with remorſe, eſpecially to be eſpyed of others. Repentance to them ſeemes baſe mindedneſſe, vnworthy of him that profeſſeth wiſedome and valour. Such a man yet can grieue when none ſees it, but himſelfe can laugh when others ſee that himſelfe feeles not; but aſſure thy ſelfe, that that mans heart bleedeth when his countenance ſmileth; he weares out many waking houres, when thou thinkeſt he reſteth. As his thoughts afford him no ſleepe, ſo his very ſleepe affords him no reſt, but while his ſenſes are tyed vp, his ſinne is looſe vglieſt ſhape, and frighteth him with helliſh dreames.
                     
                         The fire of the conſcience may lye for a time ſmothered with a pile of green wood, that it cannot be diſcerned, whoſe moyſture when it hath once maſtered, ſendeth out ſo much the greater flame, by how much it had the

greater reſiſtance. Hope not to ſtop the mouth of the conſcience from exclaiming, whiles thy ſinne continues: that endeuour is both vaine and hurtfull, which is as one ſhould ſtop the noſthrill, in hope to ſtay the iſſue, when the bloud hindered of the former courſe, breaketh out of the mouth, or findes a way downe into the ſtomacke, farre more dangerous. The conſcience cannot be pacified when ſinne is within to vexe it, no more then an angry ſwelling can ceaſe throbbing, whiles the thorne of corrupt matter lyes rotting vnderneath. Time that remedies all other euils of the minde encreaſeth this, which like to bodily diſeaſes proues worſe with continuance, and groweth vpon vs vvith our age.
                     Thus wee ſee that the wicked are in hell liuing yet vpon  the earth: but what is this to their hell hereafter? All their ſufferings here are but as their ſummons to their euerlaſting tortures after death: all their troubles in this life, but a taſte of their endleſſe torments in the life to come. Theſe be but the beginnings of their miſeries,Ier. 25.15.16. Eſay 51.17. Pſal. 75.8. the dregges of Gods wrath they ſhall drinke hereafter. All their anguiſh here is but as the porch of hell; after comes the maine ſea of all their ſorrowes: for though they haue in this life wallowed in their delights, which ſometimes through a hardneſſe of heart hath delayed their ſorrowes, yet then they muſt be turned off, as Princes Mules are wont to be at their iourneyes end, their treaſure taken from them, and their galled backes left vnto them.
                     For as wee ſee thoſe Princely Mules goe day by day  laden with treaſure, and couered with fayre cloathes, but yet at night bereaued of coyne and couer, are turned out into a ſorry ſtable, much wearyed, bruiſed, and galled: ſo ſhall this glutted ſort with galled conſciences (bereaued of worldly helpes) be thruſt to hell. Man,
                        
                           Bern. in ſerm. de primordijs.
                         (ſaith Bernard) though thou haſt loſt all ſhame, if thou feele no ſorrow, (as carnall men doe not) yet looſe not feare alſo, which is found in very beaſts. Wee vſe to load an Aſſe, and to weary him out with labour, yet he careth not for it, becauſe he is an Aſſe,

but if thou wouldeſt thruſt him into the fire, or fling him into a ditch, hee would auoid it as much as hee could, for that hee loueth his life, and feareth death. Feare thou then, and be not more ſenſleſſe then a beaſt: feare Death, feare Iudgement, feare the endleſſe paine of Hell.
                     
                         Is it not a grieuous thing for a man beloued, and of credit in the world, and making merry with his friends and companions, to be ſodainly apprehended by a Serjeant or officer, for a traitor, theefe, or murtherer, and preſently without bayle or main-priſe to be taken from his companions, to be carryed to the Gaole, and from thence to the place of execution? More grieuous and fearefull is it for a wicked man, that liues in the pleaſures of his ſinne, to be taken away by death, which is the Lords Serjeant to apprehend and bring him to the priſon of hell. As his entrance into the world was euill,
                           Bernard.
                         and his continuance in the world worſe; ſo his taking away by Death, is the worſt of all. Balaams wiſh is vſed by many, Let me dye the death of the righteous,
                        Numb. 23.10. yet they will not liue a righteous life: but few of theſe obtaine their deſire. Such are taken from the practiſe of ſinne to the puniſhment of ſin, from eaſe to torments, from men to Diuels, from death to hell.
                     
                         At the houre of death Sathan will bring all the ſinnes of a wicked man, done in his former life, like a ſquadron of enemies, all ready ſet in battell-aray, to aſſault him. No Serpents ſting doth ſo pricke and vexe a man, as the dreadfull remembrance of his wicked life paſt ſhall doe at his latter end. Therefore they feare Death as much as the malefactor the Gaoler, that leades him with gyues vnto priſon till the day of execution. They are like the Gibeonites,
                        Ioſh. 9.27. content with any condition to enioy their liues, to be bondmen and ſlaues, hewers of wood, and drawers of water. They are pulled from the earth with as great violence as Ioab from the hornes of the altar,1 Kings 2.28. whither he fled for a refuge to ſaue his life.
                     
                        What will the wicked doe in the extremity of Gods  iudgement? whither will they turne them? whoſe helpe will they craue? when all things ſhall cauſe them to feare, and proclaime open vengeance againſt them?
                           Anſelme.
                         Aboue them ſhall be their Iudge offended with their ſinnes; beneath, hell gaping to deuoure them; on their right hand ſhall be their ſinnes, accuſing them, on the left hand the Diuels as tormentours ready to receiue them; within them their conſcience grieuing: without them infinite damned ſoules wailing, weeping, and gnaſhing their teeth; Good Lord▪ what will wretched ſinners doe, inuironed with all theſe miſeries? how will their hearts ſuſtaine theſe anguiſhes? what way will they take? to goe backe is impoſſible, to goe forward is intollerable. What then ſhall they doe, but as Chriſt foretold, deſperately ſeeke for Death and ſhall not finde it, cry to the Mountaines to couer them, who yet ſhall not ſtirre to hide them? they ſhall ſtand forlorne, as miſerable caitifes to their dreadfull and deadly doome;Mat. 25.41. 
                        Goe yee curſed into euerlaſting fire prepared for the Diuell and his Angels.
                     
                     For in that man offendeth the Lord and creatour of  all things, he offendeth alſo all the creatures together in him; whither therefore may he goe? for as much as he hath made all things become enemies vnto him? There is nothing now left to take his part; euen ſo much as his owne conſcience within him barketh out againſt him; yea, it is the duetie alſo of the faithfull to reioyce in the damnation of the wicked, as well as to be glad for the ſaluation of Gods elect, and howſoeuer to, magnifie the righteouſneſſe of God. The Rauens muſt haue Hogges garbages; Partridges muſt be ſet vpon the board before Lords and great men. A Murtherer muſt be laid vpon a Hurdle. And it is as meete for Iudas to ſit in Hell,2. Tim. 2.20. as for Saint Peter to ſit in Heauen. And veſſels of diſhonour are as neceſſarie

for the glory of Gods houſe, as precious veſſels of gold for the honour of his ſeruice. Yet this is the height of their horrour, when the wicked had rather be tormented in hell,Eſay 2.19. Hoſe. 10.8. Luk. 23.3. Reuel. 6.16. & 9.6. then to ſee the face of Chriſt their fearefull Iudge, wiſhing the very Mountaines to hide them, and the Hils and Rockes to couer them from the glory of his preſence.

                  THE SECOND BOOKE. What DEATH is in Chriſt.
                  
                     CHAP. I. Chriſt alone, and none other, can and doth redeeme vs from death and damnation.
                     
                        WHat our fearefull eſtate is without  Chriſt we haue heard before, being holden in the ſhadow of death by the chaines of our ſins, the weight and burthen whereof is the law of God laid vpon vs; Hell is our priſon, and Death is our Gaolor to hold vs. See how faſt we are locked from God and his Saints in the dungeon of Death, by the meanes of ſinne, which is a ſword to the heart, a ſerpent in the boſome, poyſon in the ſtomacke, a thiefe in the houſe. It woundeth Nature, ſtingeth the conſcience, killeth charitie, and depriueth vs of Gods fauour, which is the worſt of all.
                     Now in this diſtreſſe, Chriſt came to viſite vs in his due time, euen God and man (a right redeemer for vs) he tooke our cauſe vpon him, and wreſtled with the Diuell that held vs by our ſinnes in Death.Heb. 2.14.16; 17. &c. This mighty Sauiour tooke fleſh and blood to take our part, none could be our Mediatour

but he alone, none amongſt the Angels (for they are no men) not any amongſt the Saints, for they were all ſinners; neither any amongſt the other creatures, for they were all corruptible: ſo that we can neither giue gold nor ſiluer for the redemption of our ſoules, neither can wee truſt in the merits of Angels and Saints, who all want vertue for this worke; but onely in Chriſt the Sonne of God and man, a meete redeemer for vs, who is our Prieſt alone,Heb. 7.24.25.26.27. abiding for euer, becauſe he liueth for euer; neither can his Prieſthood be tranſlated to another: and as the ſacrifice is his owne, ſo hee is Prieſt alone, to offer it to his Father; which he did once for all vpon the Croſſe for all belieuers.
                     
                         All promiſe and hope of life is in Chriſt alone, who hath alone the word of life,Ioh. 6.68.35. who is alone the bread of life, the water of life, the author of life, yea, life it ſelfe: he that beleeueth in him hath euerlaſting life,Ioh. 5. and hee that dwelleth not in him ſhall neuer ſee life, but abideth ſtill in death. Take hold of Chriſt, and take hold of life; if thou reach out thy hand to any other thing, thou catcheſt for the winde;Ioh. 6.53.54. Looke not for life but where it dwelleth, in the fleſh of Chriſt alone there it reſteth. Death hath reigned in all the world beſide, and ledde euery creature into bondage.Eſa. 63.16. If thou lookeſt to the heauens, there is but clouds and darknes, if to the earth there is but ſorrow and ſadneſſe. If thou calleſt to Abraham, he knoweth thee not; if thou cry to Angels, they cannot comfort thee: if thou looke into thy workes, they are vncleane; if thou truſt in thy prayers, the Lord hath no pleaſure in them; call for the helpe of all creatures, they are ſubiect to vanitie, there is no life nor reſt,Apoc. 7.10.11.12. but in Chriſt alone. The elders and Angels, the beaſts and all creatures, they giue this honour vnto Chriſt alone. Saluation is to him that ſitteth vpon the throne, and of the Lambe, and they all ſhoute together and ſay, Amen. He that would not wander and goe aſtray, ſhould know both whither and which way to goe. Now both of thoſe we haue in Chriſt alone, very God, and very man: for in

that he is God, and conſequently life, to him wee muſt goe; and in that he is man, by him wee muſt come vnto God, and be vnited with him, that we may obtaine euerlaſting life, and be freed from death. If he be the life,
                           Aug. de ciu. dei lib. 11. cap. 12. Ioh. 14.6. then is he the place to whom we muſt goe; if he be the way, by him we muſt trauell to attaine eternall life: and if he be the truth (that is) the accompliſhment of the law and Prophets, concerning both the ſhadowes and ſubſtance of Gods promiſes, then alſo is he the onely meanes of our redemption.
                     God was ſo gracious and mercifull vnto mankinde  that he beſtowed not onely his goods, but himſelfe to redeeme vs, and that not ſo much for his owne ſake, as for mans behoofe. That man might be borne of God, God was firſt borne of Man. Who can hate man, whoſe nature and likeneſſe hee beholdeth in the humanity of God? Doubtleſſe who ſo loueth not man, hateth God,2 Ioh. 3.14. and ſo abideth in death. God became man for mans ſake, that he might be a redeemer, as he was before a creatour, that men not onely might be ranſomed thorough his riches, but alſo loue him the more for his goodneſſe. God appeared in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, that each ſenſe of man might be made bleſſed in him, and as well the eye of the heart renewed in his diuinity, as the eye of the body in his humanity; that whether it goe in, or out, mans nature which he hath created, might in it finde comfort and refreſhing.
                     No man or any creature elſe is able to ſatisfie God for  ſinne, and ſo ſaue from death. An infinite iuſtice is offended, an infinite puniſhment is deſerued by euery ſin, and euery mans ſinnes are as neere to infinitie as number can make them. Where then ſhall we finde an infinite value, but in him who is onely and altogether infinite in himſelfe? the dignity of whoſe perſon being infinite, gaue ſuch worth to his ſatisfaction, that what hee ſuffered in ſhort time might ſatisfie beyond all times. Chriſt did all, and ſuffered all; he did it for vs, we in him; hee emptied

himſelfe of his glory,Phil. 2.7. 2 Cor. 8.9. that hee might put on our ſhame and miſery, not ceaſing to be God (which he was) he became man, which before he was not; Man to be a perfect mediatour betwixt God and man, which were both in one perſon: God that he might ſatisfie; Man that hee might ſuffer:1. Tim. 2.5. that ſince man had ſinned, and God was offended; he which was both God and man might ſatisfie God for man: None therefore (but he) can beare our ſinnes, and none but he can pay the wages of our ſinnes, which is the ſuſtaining of euerlaſting Death. None but he can pleade our cauſe,Math. 3.15. & 5.27.18. which onely hath fulfilled all righteouſnes for vs. None can purchaſe our ſaluation but hee onely that hath paid the price of our redemption.
                     
                         He alone hath trod the wine-preſſe of Gods wrath, and there was none to helpe him. The cup of bitter affliction whereof he taſted,Eſay. 63.3. the drops of blood (which in his agony diſtilled from his face) for no intreaty with his father could paſſe from him to any other.Luk. 22.41.42.44. None but he ſaueth vs, and he is but one, and will be alone in all his courſes, without mixture,Act. 4.12. without medley. Firſt, laſt, and middeſt, and all filling all, yet fined from all, in the glorious worke of our redemption.Iohn 3.13. No man can aſcend, but by him that did deſcend, and that is Chriſt: the ladder which Iacob ſaw at Peniel,
                        Gen. 28.12. Exod. 13.21. 1 Cor. 10.1. the Cloud by day, and the Piller by night, which guideth thee Iſraell of God in the deſart of this world, the Kings highway to heauen and happy reſt.
                     
                         There is no Paradiſe without this tree of life; no perfume without this balme ſo ſweete;Gen. 2.9. 1 Pet. 2.6. Eſay 20.16. Rom. 9.33. 1 Pet. 1.19. no building ſure without this corner-ſtone; no ſacrifice to pleaſe without this vnſpotted Lambe. I ſay there is no God without Chriſt in this wicked world. As the light of the day is conueyed vnto vs by the Sunne in the firmament: ſo is the brightneſſe of heauen by that Sonne of righteouſneſſe: A Planet in the midſt of Planets, to lighten all aboue, and all below, whom bleſſed Angels deſire to behold, and godly men are earneſt to adore. Chriſt is ſufficient of himſelfe onely, and ſo perfect is his glory that all height muſt be

abaſed before him; he created alone, and he will redeeme alone; he made alone and hee will ſaue alone: nothing elſe in earth, nothing in heauen, nor in the heauen of heauens: no vertue, no power, no ſtrength, no name,Acts 4.12. no meanes of ſaluation, but by this our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and him alone; winne him and enioy ail good things: looſe him and though thou ſhouldeſt get the whole world thy gaine is but damnation.Ionah 2.7. Mat. 12.40. Daniel 6.16. Chriſt is our true Ionah that was alotted to die, to deliuer his companions from Death and Diuell. He is our true Daniel, caſt betweene the iawes of theſe deuouring beaſt (euen the Diuell and Death) and yet was not conſumed: he was ſunke and ſwallowed downe into the bottome of the ſea of our ſinnes, and yet was not drowned, but enioyed ſtill the breath of life.
                     Many deſpaire of ſaluation, becauſe of their owne vnworthineſſe, as though there were no hope of Gods mercie, vnleſſe we bring our gifts and pawnes in our hands; but this indeede were to diſcredit the Lords mercy, and bring in credit our owne merits, and rather binde the Lord to vs, then vs to him. But if our ſins be great, our redemption is greater, though our merits be beggerly, Gods mercy is a rich mercy. If our caſe were not deſperate and we paſt hope of recouery, our redemption ſhould not be ſo precious and plentifull: But when Heauen and Earth, Sunne and Moone, and Starres goe againſt vs; then to ranſome vs and make a perfect reſtitution, is to draw ſomething out of nothing; Euen as in ſickneſſe to haue either little danger, or being in great danger to haue preſent deliuerance by meanes, is nothing in reſpect: but in extreame perill when Phyſicke can doe nothing, and nothing maketh for vs but the graue: then to be reſcued from the pit, and to recouer our life from Death it ſelfe (which Chriſt onely could and did) is redemption indeede.
                     Our righteouſneſſe conſiſteth in Chriſt alone, who therefore is called our righteouſneſſe, as Ieremy ſaith.Ierem. 23.6. 1 Cor. 1.30. He  (ſaith Paul) is our righteouſneſſe and ſanctification and

redemption, by his obedience many were made righteous; he hath paid our debts,Rom. 5.19. Eſay 35.4. Col. 1.20. by him alone wee are reconciled vnto God: he hath obtained remiſſion for our ſinnes by his death; he hath pacified the wrath of God his father; he hath waſhed vs in his blood, which clenſeth vs from all ſinne.2 Cor. 5.19. 1 Tim. 2.5.6. Eſay 53.5. All things (ſaith Chriſt) are giuen to mee, of God. If we then will haue all that is neceſſary for our happines, as Gods fauour, righteouſnes, life, pardon of our ſins, ſanctification of the ſpirit,1 Ioh. 1.7. Mat. 11.17. redemption, &c. We muſt addreſſe our ſelues to Ieſus Chriſt alone, whom the Father hath choſen to be the Lord-treaſurer of heauen,Iohn 6.27. and ſteward of all his graces. As in the colde winter we can be no ſooner from the fire but we are colde, nor out of the light but we are in darkneſſe; ſo we are no ſooner gone from Chriſt who is our true righteouſneſſe, light and life; but ſtraight way we are in ſinne and death, for as much as he is the life that quickneth vs; the Sunne that giues vs light, the fire that warmeth, comforteth and refreſheth all his members. As the Moone hath her light from the Sunne, ſo the Church hath her light, life, and righteouſnes from Chriſt her head: Chriſt is the ſheepe that hath borne the wooll and fleece to make vs garments of righteouſneſſe to couer our ſinne and wickedneſſe. Hee as a glorious King hath adorned the Queene his ſpouſe. He hath prepared for her all rich and ſumptuous robes,Pſal. 45.13.14. Ezech. 16.10. hee hath waſhed her from her blood and pollutions throughout.
                     
                         And as there is nothing more vncleane, then the Church when ſhe is naked in her ſelfe: ſo there is nothing more beautifull then when ſhe is decked with the Iewels and ornaments of her husband Chriſt: becauſe (as Auguſtine ſaith) he is a ſpunge which wipeth and clenſeth vs from all our filthineſſe,
                           Auguſtine.
                         which he taketh in exchange for his beautie and righteouſneſſe. Chriſt is ſaid to keepe the key of life and Death, the one to make faſt and ſhut to the gates of Hell,Reuel. 1.18. which alwaies ſtood open to ſwallow vs vp, and the other to vnlocke the kingdome of heauen, which alwayes was ſhut and barred againſt vs: By meanes whereof

at the time of his death, the vaile rent aſunder,Math. 27.51. that kept the entrance into the moſt holy place.
                     What is more filthy then a man conceiued and borne  in ſinne? and what is more cleane and beautifull then our Sauiour Chriſt conceiued by the holy Ghoſt?Cant. 5.10. 
                        My welbeloued is white and ruddy, the choyſeſt of tenne thouſand. This ſweet and louing Lord, that was ſo fayre and cleane, was content to beare the blemiſhes of our ſinnes, and filthineſſe of our ſoules, to make vs beautifull in Gods ſight. It was a worke of great patience and humilitie (ſaith Cyprian) that ſo high and excellent a Maieſtie would vouchſafe to come downe from heauen to earth,
                        
                           Cyprianus.
                         
                        and all to cloath himſelfe with this our houſe of clay and dirt, and that hee would ſo hide the glory of his immortalitie, to become mortall for ſinfull man: that being himſelfe innocent and faultleſſe, yet ſhould be ſo puniſhed for vs that are guilty, that hee that came to pardon ſinnes, would be content to be waſhed with the water of ſinners: that hee that feedeth all creatures, ſhould faſt himſelfe, and be hungry, that hee might fill ſinners with his grace, and ſatiſfie hungry ſoules with his righteouſneſſe, &c. How was hee ſpoyled of his earthly garments, that apparelleth the Saints with the royall roabes of immortalitie and glory? How was hee proffered moſt bitter gall, that offereth to vs the heauenly Manna and food of our ſoules?Math. 27.34. How did his enemies giue him vinegar to drinke, that reacheth out vnto vs the wine and Nectar of life and ſaluation? Hee that was iuſt and innocent, or rather Iuſtice and Innocencie it ſelfe, was iudged and executed among theeues and murtherers:Luke 23.33. the euerlaſting Truth was accuſed of falſhood, the righteous Iudge of the world was condemned himſelfe, and that Word of God (the very fountaine of eternall life) receiued the ſentence and doome of death with ſilence, &c.Iohn 1.4. Innocencie was tyed with bands, Vertue apprehended, Wiſdome flouted, Honour contemned, Glory defaced, the well-ſpring of all vertue troubled.
                     Chriſt (as the true Iſaack and ſonne of promiſe) bare  the wood vpon his owne ſhoulder to the place of ſacrifice;Gen. 22.6.
                        
this carriage was diuided betweene two, the ſonne carryed the wood and the body that ſhould be ſacrificed, and the father carryed the fire and the knife wherewith the ſacrifice ſhould be accompliſhed. It was the fire of Loue which God bare to mankinde, and the ſharpe knife of diuine Iuſtice, that put the Sonne of God to death. Theſe two vertues in God our heauenly Father contended together: Loue requeſted him to pardon mankinde, and his Iuſtice required that ſinners might be puniſhed. Wherefore that man might be pardoned, and ſinne puniſhed, a meanes was found, that Chriſt an innocent man, might dye, and by his death redeeme all ſinfull men that doe beleeue. Chriſt is our true Sampſon, that for the loue of his Spouſe the Church, ſuffered himſelfe to be bound hand and foote,Iudg. 15.13. & 16.19.25. to be ſhaued of his lockes, and ſpoyled of his force, and ſo to be mocked and ſcorned of all his enemies for our ſakes.
                     
                         Chriſt in his death, is the golden propitiatorie, the Rainebow of diuers colours,Exod. 25.17. Heb. 9.12.13. Gen. 9.13. placed among the clouds of heauen, with the ſight whereof Almighty God is pacified: with this were his eyes fed, his iuſtice ſatisfied, and his fauour reſtored.Eſay 55.1. 
                        Yee that be a thirſt, come yee to the waters.
                        1 Cor. 10.1. Chriſt is the myſticall Rocke that Moſes ſtroke with the rod,Exod. 17.6. whence ſpringeth the abundance of water, to ſatisfie the thirſt of poore afflicted ſoules. Hee is that cluſter of grapes,Numb. 13.24. brought out of the Land of Promiſe, out of the which was preſſed that ioyfull wine to fill the cup of our ſaluation.2 King. 4.4.5. Hee is the oyle of grace, wherewith wee muſt repay our debts. Wee muſt not looke ſo much to the quantitie, as to the vertue thereof, which is ſo great and good, that ſo long as there be faithfull ſoules (as veſſels to be filled therewith) ſo long will the veyne of this ſacred liquour runne and neuer ceaſe.Heb. 12.24. Gen 4.10. The bloud of Chriſt cryeth better things then that of Abel: for his bloud cryed for vengeance againſt the murtherer, but this his precious bloud cryeth and craueth for pardon of our ſinnes.Ezech. 33.11. & 18.23. Aug. in ſoliloq.
                         
                        O Lord (ſaith Auguſtine) thou wilt not the death

of a ſinner, nor reioyceſt in the deſtruction of the damned; but that the dead might liue thou dyedſt, and thy death hath killed the death of ſinners. And if they through thy death were againe brought to life, Oh grant (I beſeech thee) that I may not dye now thou art aliue.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. That Chriſt by his death and merits, alone, without any meanes of man, or other creature, redeemeth vs from death and damnation.
                     
                        NO Creature but Ieſus Chriſt alone (as  hath beene declared) could poſſibly reſcue vs from death, and reſtore vs to euerlaſting life. Now followeth in order the manner and meanes of our redemption: for as our deliuerance proceeded onely from Chriſt himſelfe; ſo all the meanes and compleate worke thereof was performed by himſelfe alone, without ſupply. He tooke our nature vpon him to take our part, that ſo hee might deſtroy (through death) him that had the power of death, that is to ſay, the Diuill:
                        Heb. 2.14. 
                        and that hee might deliuer all them which for feare of death were all their life time ſubiect to bondage. Hee ſuffered for our ſinnes,
                        1 Pet. 3.18. 
                        the iuſt for the vniuſt, that he might bring vs to God, and was put to death concerning the fleſh, but was quickned in the ſpirit, that hee might be our ranſome.
                     God is iuſt, and we hauing ſmitten his Maieſtie by our ſinne, muſt be ſmitten againe by his puniſhment: for hee  is ſo to be mercifull, as that hee diſanull not his Iuſtice; and ſo to be iuſt, as that hee forget not his Mercy. Now to make a way to both: to appeaſe his wrath that his Iuſtice may be ſatisfied; and yet ſo to appeaſe it, as his Mercy may be magnified in forgiuing ſinne, it was neceſſary that there ſhould be a mediation. For if all the world ſhould be offered vnto God for ſatisfaction, it is nothing:

for it is his owne, euen the worke of his hands; for infinite ſinnes, there muſt be infinite ſufferings, and infinite ſatisfaction, and therefore he that muſt redeeme vs, muſt be an infinite Sauiour, euen God himſelfe (as wee haue heard,) yet man alſo he muſt be, euen a true Immanuel, God with man.Eſay 7.14. For how can there be ſatisfaction for our apoſtacie, but by our humilitie? or procurement of life, but by ſuffering of death? Now when God commeth to obay, hee muſt needes be humbled; and when hee comes to deſerue, he muſt needes ſerue; which God alone could not doe: and when he comes to dye, hee muſt needes be mortall, which God could not be: therefore hee was man to be bound himſelfe, and God to free others. Man to ſuffer, God to vanquiſh; Man to become mortall, God to triumph ouer death.
                     
                         Chriſt thus fitted to be our Sauiour, proceeded to the worke of our redemption. Now in our ſins (from which hee ſaueth vs) wee muſt conſider three things: firſt, our diſobedience to the Law;Gen. 6.5.& 8.21. ſecondly, our originall corruption; thirdly, our condemnation for this corruption. The firſt of theſe is double, eyther in breaking the Law, or not fulfilling it: The ſecond is the originall cauſe of this diſobedience, which is the euill inclination of our heart, and our corrupt affections: The third is the puniſhment of this diſobedience, hell fire itſelfe. Theſe being as three running ſoares, are healed and cured by three running ſtreames in Chriſt: For our rebellion to the Law is ſatisfied in him, who not onely paid the penaltie for that wee had broken it, but actually fulfilled euery poynt thereof to the full. For the ſecond, which is our originall corruption, wee haue the holineſſe and ſanctification of his nature, which was euer ſeperate from all vncleanneſſe: ſo that now in Chriſt our redeemer, our eſtate is farre better, then euer it was in Adam in his firſt creation; for though he was made good, yet was he changeably good (as hath beene ſaid before) but thoſe that are in Chriſt, are abſolutely good, and vnmoueable, euen as the ſtrongeſt

mountaines that cannot be ſtirred. Thirdly, wee haue Chriſt by his paſſion to deliuer vs from condemnation: Euen as in the ſacrifice vnder the Law, the blood of the innocent beaſt was ſhed for him that had ſinned, who worthily by ſinne deſerued to dye himſelfe; ſo we by the ſhedding of Chriſts blood that immaculate Lambe,Eſay 53.5. Heb. 10.19.20. are purged from the guilt of all our ſinnes (for by his ſtripes we are healed) and by ſuffering in his fleſh hee hath prepared a ready way for vs to heauen, hauing rendred in the ſame moſt perfect obedience for vs, and by his death fully ſatisfied his Father for our ſinnes, and through the remiſſion thereof obtayned righteouſneſſe, and by righteouſneſſe the grace and fauour of God, and by grace euerlaſting life,Heb. 4.16. that wee may boldly preſent our ſelues before the throne of God.
                     But here obſerue the wonderfull wiſedome of God, in  the worke of our redemption, prouiding ſuch remedy, which none could haue deuiſed but God alone: for what elſe is death but the power of the Diuell, and the vtter euerſion of all the world? Now to make the death of Chriſt as an antidote againſt the death of man, and the very meanes to vanquiſh Diuell and Hell, as alſo the high way to heauen and happineſſe it ſelfe, what was it elſe but the excellent vertue,2 Cor. 4.6. Gen. 1.3. and admirable wiſedome of him alone, who calleth all things that are not, as though they were, bringing light out of darkneſſe, good out of euill, and death out of life? And ſurely, if all men and Angels ſhould haue conſpired together in ſtudy and deuiſe to wiſh a plague to haue fallen vpon Diuell and Death it ſelfe, they could not haue determined ſuch another courſe, to wit, that their glory ſhould be their ſhame, their power ſhould be their plague, and their kingdom of pride their vtter confuſion.Pſal. 69.22: What could the Prophet Dauid in all the hotteſt zeale he boare to God, wiſh more againſt the wretched reprobates, ſo traiterous to Chriſt his ſonne, and to his Goſpell, then to pray that their dainty tables might be as ſnares to take themſelues withall, and that

their great proſperitie might be their greateſt ruine. Euen thus hath Chriſt ouercome the Diuell and Death: and albeit they ſtill doe warre againſt the Church, yet their ſtrength is ſo weakened, and their power ſo abated, that they cannot hurt it.
                     
                         And where the Apoſtle ſaith, that by death Chriſt ouercame him that had the power of death,Heb. 2.14. it is clearely manifeſt what manner of death our Sauiour Chriſt ſuſtayned, euen that ouer which the Diuell had his power: the ſame death which is the reward of ſinne,Rom. 6.23. by bearing it he ouercame it, and hee conquered no more then hee ſubmitted himſelfe vnto: for by death hee ouercame death, If hee ſuffered no more but a bodily death, hee ouercame alſo but a bodily death, and ſo though wee all riſe againe, yet ſhould wee ariſe in the condemnation of the ſinne of our ſoules: or if hee haue ouercome death and the power of it,Mr. Dearing.
                         both in our bodies and ſoules, then Chriſt hath ſuffered the paines of it both in body and ſoule, that wee might riſe againe from the bands of death, and liue with him for euer: for hee hath broken the force of it no further then hee hath felt the ſting of it himſelfe. Therefore let vs beleeue, that Chriſt, both body and ſoule was made a ſacrifice for our ſinnes:Mat. 26.38. for ſo hee ſaid himſelfe, My ſoule is exceeding ſorrowfull euen vnto death.
                        Mar. 14.33.34. And Marke ſaith, Hee beganne to be aſtoniſhed with his griefe, and was ouerwhelmed with his ſorrow.
                        Luke 22.43.44 And S. Luke declareth that in his Agonie, his ſweate was as droppes of bloud, diſtilling from his face, and that God ſent an Angell from heauen to comfort him.
                     
                         And can wee thinke that all this was for the feare of bodily death,Acts 5.41. & 16.25. which many of Gods children (yea, many wicked men) haue deſperately deſpiſed? Did the Apoſtles ſing in Priſon, and went away reioycing being whipped and ſcourged?2 Cor. 11.18. &c. Did Paul glory in ſo many tribulations which hee reckoneth vp, and ſhould our Sauiour Chriſt in the like paine with a fainting heart cry out, My God,
                        Math. 27. 
                        my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? No, no, if could not be (ſaith a godly man) but that which hath made Chriſt

to tremble, would haue torne his Apoſtles and deareſt Saints a ſunder▪ that which made him to ſweat blood ſo plentifully, would haue made all other creatures to haue ſunke to the bottome of hell moſt ſodainly: and that which forced him to cry, would haue held both men and Angels in euerlaſting woe, and helliſh howlings without all end.
                     Which comfortable poynt ſerueth to confute the hereticall  doctrine of all ſuch which ſay, that the ſoule of Chriſt ſuffred nothing but only for the bodies ſake, as our ſoules ſuffer when our bodies are weake, ſicke, or a dying. But how then ſhould wee be ſaued from the death of ſinne and condemnation? Doe they know that hee bore our ſinnes in his body,1 Pet. 2.24. Eſay 53.5.9. and ſubmitted himſelfe to the death of the Croſſe, and that by the wounds of his ſtripes wee are healed? And did our ſinnes deſerue onely a bodily death, and not a ſpirituall alſo, which is the wrath of God holding body and ſoule in the euerlaſting fire of hell?Eph. 3.18.19. This alſo maketh for the exceeding comfort of Gods elect, to know the bottomleſſe loue of Chriſt beyond all knowledge indeed; who was accurſed for our ſakes, and ſuffered for vs not onely the torments of his body, but the anguiſh and horrour of his ſoule, and the wrath of his Father, which wounded his fleſh and ſpirit vnto death, and would haue held him in that condemnation for euer, if hee had beene no ſtronger then wee that had deſerued it: But being alſo the Sonne of God (in whom the fulneſſe of the God-head dwelleth bodily) the eternall ſpirit that was with him, did looſe the chaines of Sathan,Col. 2.9. Death, and Hell, and ſo hee mightily aroſe from the power of the Diuell, of which it was impoſſible hee ſhould be holden, and hath left thoſe his enemies, euen Diuell, Death, and Hell, in ignominie and darkneſſe, and hath aboliſhed them for euer and euer, not to hurt vs any more.
                     As a Bee (ſaith one) ſtinging a dead body takes no  hurt, but ſtinging a liue body many times looſeth both

ſting and life together: in like manner, Death ſo long as it ſtung mortall men onely (which were dead in ſinne) was neuer a whit the worſe; but when it went about to ſting Chriſt (which is life it ſelfe) by and by it loſt both ſting and ſtrength. Hee that felleth a tree vpon which the Sunne ſhineth, may well cut the tree, but cannot hurt the Sunne. Hee that poureth water vpon iron (which is red hot) may well quench the heate, but he cannot hurt the iron, but rather makes it harder: ſo Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe did driue away the ſhadow of death, and as glowing iron hee was too hot and hard a morſell for Death to digeſt.
                     
                         As the while Adam did eate any other fruit (which God gaue him leaue to eate,) hee was nouriſhed by it; but when hee had taſted of the forbidden tree, hee periſhed: euen ſo, Death had leaue to deuoure any other man (Chriſt onely excepted,) but when it went about to deſtroy Chriſt, then it was deſtroyed it ſelfe. Death indeed did taſte of Chriſt, but could not ſwallow him vp nor digeſt him.
                           Fulgentius.
                         Contrariwiſe Chriſt as ſoone as euer hee had but a little taſted of death, eft-ſoones he did deuoure it, and ſwallow it vp in victory. Death, as a rauenous beaſt deuouring all men, ſnatched at our Sauiour Chriſt, but hauing caught him, could not hold him in her iawes; but perceiuing the worthineſſe of the prey (trembling for feare) let him goe free: for although Death ſeemed to ſwallow him (when hee was dead) yet finding him farre from the infection of ſinne, ſhee could not retaine him in her houſe.
                     As the life of Chriſt is the life of life; ſo the death of  Chriſt is the death of death. Long before his death hee challenged Death,Oſee 13.14. 1 Cor. 15.54. and threatned his death; O Death, I will be thy death: and after his death he ſcorned Death as a Drone without a ſting. It is reported that the Dragon killeth the Elephant, yet ſo as the Elephant falling downe killeth the Dragon with him. As an Elephant (as the ſtory ſaith) killed Eleazar, yet ſo as Eleazar falling downe

killed the Elephant with him: So the Diuell and Death by killing Chriſt were killed themſelues. The Elephant liued not after he had killed the Dragon, nor Eleazar after he had ſlaine the Elephant. But Chriſt liued and doth foreuer liue after the full deſtruction of the diuell and death. Though Chriſt in his graue was neuer like to riſe againe: yet he died not, but mortalitie died in him, and immortalitie ſo liued in his perſon, that (euen in his ſepulchre) he did moſt liue when hee ſeemed moſt to be dead: as the Lawrill it greeneſt in the fouleſt winter; and the Lime is hotteſt in the coldeſt water; and the Glow-worme lighteſt when the night is darkeſt. Chriſt by Death was wounded, but his enemies and ours, Death and Diuell vtterly ſpoyled; his buckler (which was his god-head) was whole and vntouched. So that his death was no death indeede, but an exaltation vnto greater glory.Iohn 12.32. He was led (ſaith Eſay) as a ſheepe before the Shearer:
                        Eſay 53.7. 
                        Shorne he was (ſaith one) by Death, but not for euer depriued of life. But as a Lambe is much more nimble and liuely by ſhearing: ſo this ſhearing by Death, was a kinde of quickning to Chriſt.
                     Chriſt is that louing Rahel which dieth her ſelfe that  her Son may liue. He is that painefull Adam,
                        Gen. 35.18. who by the ſweate of his browes hath earned for vs the bread of life: He is that iuſt Noah which ſhutting vp himſelfe in his Arke (as a Sepulchre) ſaueth all that come to him aliue:Gen. 7.16. He is that tender Pellican, which wounding his owne breſt, doth with his blood reſtore his faithfull broode to life. And as honie being found in a dead Lion was the ſuſtenance of Sampſon: So Chriſts gall is our honie,Iudg. 14.8.9 and his bitter Death, by reaſon of his righteouſneſſe,Mat. 26.15. is the ſweete life of all beleeuers.
                     Now the remembrance of Chriſt crucified, muſt ſerue  to crucifie ſin: for then Chriſt doth ſleepe in thee when thou forgetteſt his paſſion,
                           Auguſt.
                         and the readieſt way and directeſt path to goe to heauen is to ſwimme through the riuer of Chriſts blood, the drops whereof (rayning from the cloudes of his mercy) commonly quench the fiery

flames of Gods burning wrath which cannot be extinguiſhed by the vertuous water of any mans merit. It is the oyle of grace which muſt purge our defiled hearts. It is the dew of heauen which will make vs flouriſh. Chriſts death alone therefore is the welſpring of our ſaluation. Oh loue this good thing in which all good things are, & it is enough for thee. Where is ſafe and ſtedfaſt reſt and aſſuredneſſe for the weake and wounded ſoule, but in the wounds of our Sauiour Chriſt? and ſo much the ſurer I dwell therein, as he is mightier to ſaue me. The world rageth, the body burdeneth, the Diuell (like a deuouring Lyon) roareth: yet the faithfull fall not, becauſe they are builded vpon Chriſt the rocke.
                           Bern. ſer. 6. in Canti.
                        
                     
                     
                         I haue ſinned a grieuous ſinne, my conſcience is troubled, but it is not diſtreſſed, becauſe I remember the wounds of my Ieſus. Our ſafe ſanctuarie in all diſtreſſe, is Ieſus Chriſt: who wholly gaue himſelfe, and ſpent his ſoule in ſuffering for our ſinnes, ſtill remaining our Aduocate to his Father; and crying alwayes vnto vs to come to him for reſt. In the caue of this rocke wee may ſafely hide our ſelues;Mat. 23.37. his death is the ſecret den for our deliuerance from eternall death and hell. Vnder the wings of this Hen may the poore and naked chickens hide themſelues,Ioh. 3.14.15: & be ſure and ſafe from all helliſh Kites. There is nothing ſo ſoueraigne a remedie againſt the ſtinging of that infernall ſerpent, as to faſten the eye of our faith vpon Ieſus Chriſt heaued vp and exalted vpon the Croſſe. The venemous by tings of thoſe helliſh ſpirits of damnation, cannot once annoy vs, if wee fully repoſe our truſt in Chriſt alone that was crucified. His Croſſe and paſſion is the triumphant enſigne of victorie to all the true Iſraelites of God. He hath fought the fight, and got the conqueſt for vs, that being deliuered from our enemies, wee may ſerue him without feare, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life.
                        Luk. 1.74.75.
                     
                     
                         Faith ſheweth to Chriſtian Souldiers the blood of Chriſt, to whet them on in their ſpirituall warfare, to win

the field, as the blood of Grapes and Mulberries (ſhewed to the Elephants in warre) prouoke them to fight. For Chriſtians (indeede) ouercome through the blood of the Lambe.Apoc. 12.11. By the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt alone (apprehended by faith) we are reconciled vnto God; hee hath paid our debts by ſuffering Death, and ſatisfying the Law, who is the end of the Law and the Prophets. But they that giue neuer ſo little to their owne deſeruings (in the worke of their redemption) doe wrongfully keepe to themſelues the praiſe of grace, paſſing by them:
                           Bern. ſer. 15. in Cantit.
                         as if a wall ſhould ſay it bringeth forth light, when it receiueth it through a window. We are of our ſelues, but diuels and ſathans, euen aduerſaries to God; enemies to his Lawes,
                           Auguſt in Ioh.
                         and foes of all vertues: neither is there any other difference betwixt vs and them, but the onely pittie and gracious fauour of God our Father.
                     The grace of Chriſt muſt be our onely cloathing before  the iudgement ſeate of God: for there is nothing in vs that can pleaſe and content him, but onely his goodneſſe in Chriſt that he hath put within vs. Much it is (I grant) which wickedneſſe hath deſerued: yet farre much more it is which the loue of my redeemer challengeth. For though great be mine vnrighteouſneſſe: yet is the righteouſneſſe of my redeemer greater. Becauſe how much God is better then man; by ſo much is my wickedneſſe inferiour to his goodneſſe, both in qualitie and quantitie. For what hath man committed which the Sonne of God, made man, hath not redeemed? Surely had wee the knowledge and power of the holy Angels; yet could our amends be nothing correſpondent to thy mercy and goodneſſe: and were all our members conuerted into tongues, yet could we neuer extoll thee ſufficiently. All our ſtrength is in humilitie, the humble man is an vnmoueable rocke built vpon Chriſt. There is none ſo hard to be healed, as hee that thinketh himſelfe to be whole: ſuch a one careth not for the Phyſitian, nor keeping of good diet. Men commonly ioyne with their equals in riches, dignity, and

greatneſſe. But God (which is the ſoueraigne maieſtie and height it ſelfe) conſorts himſelfe with none but thoſe that be poore and meeke. It is beſt therefore before our God to confeſſe our ſelues banckrupts, and (as the prouerbe is) to lay the keyes vnder the dore, forſaking all when it commeth to ſatisfie God. In this we ſhould reſemble the couetous men, who alwaies thinke themſelues poore what riches ſo euer they haue) becauſe they ſtill more regard what they deſire, then what they haue.
                     
                         God pardoneth where he loueth, and he is mercifull where he hath iuſt cauſe to hate: ſo that he is mercifull and hateth not, he pardoneth and loueth where he findeth a fault, and ſeeth who hath neede of compaſſion, that both he and we may be knowne; hee by his mercy, we by our deſart, that to him might all praiſe be giuen; and we (when we would reioyce) might reioyce onely in the Lord. If I wholly owe my ſelfe to my God for my firſt making, what ſhall I then further giue him, for my reforming and new making after I was marred with ſinne? In the firſt he gaue me to my ſelfe; in the ſecond himſelfe to me; and giuing himſelfe to me,
                           Bernar. de delig. deo.
                         he reſtored me againe to my ſelfe: therefore both giuen and reſtored, I owe my ſelfe to God for my ſelfe, and ſhall be indebted ſtill. What therefore ſhall I render to the Lord for himſelfe? For although I ſhould giue my ſelfe a thouſand times, what am I to God that redeemed mee, and wholly gaue himſelfe for my ſinnes and ſaluation.
                     
                         Chriſts power is made perfect in our weakeneſſe, for where the fleſh carrieth a confidence in it ſelfe,2. Cor. 12.9. there is no roome for the ſpirit of God,Rom. 8.26. for the ſpirit onely helpeth thoſe that be infirme, & Chriſt is a Phyſitian to thoſe that be ſicke. As all waters come from the ſea (as from the well-head) and returne thither againe, boyling out of the vaines of the earth: ſo God ſending out the ſtreames of his law into our hearts, it muſt (euen from the very bottome of of our hearts) returne to him againe: for wee haue nothing,1. Cor. 4.7. but what we haue receiued. Chriſt is all things to

vs that haue nothing: he is our bread being hungry; our drinke being thirſtie; our light being blinde; our health being ſicke: the life of our deſires, the heauen of our mindes: a guide to our wandring ſteppes; our ſuccour in neceſſitie; all in all things to be beleeuers. As life is conueied from the heart through the vaines to all the vitall parts: ſo is ſaluation from the Father through Chriſt to all his liuing members.
                     As out of Eden went a riuer to water the garden, which  being deriued into foure heads,Gen. 2.10. compaſſed the whole world: ſo out of heauen flowed the ſtreame of Gods mercie, in and through our Sauiour Chriſt, whoſe graces (deriued diuerſely) cauſe all the earth to be filled with his glorie. Chriſt is a mutuall helpe to the Father and to vs. He is a hand to the Father, by which he reacheth vs, and a hand to vs by which we reach him. The Fathers mouth by which he ſpeaketh to vs, and our mouth to the Father by which we ſpeake to him. Our God is a conſuming fire (without Chriſt our vaile) wee cannot endure him.Heb. 12.29. Deut. 4.24. For what is our miſerie but to meete with his maieſtie, except it be onely in the temple of mercie? which mercies ſeate & all is Chriſt. As then our words are meſſengers of our mindes,Col. 1.15. Heb. 1.3. and ſemblance of our ſoules, to parley with our friends: ſo is Chriſt the Sonne of God, the image of the Father, and mouth to inſtruct his deareſt Saints: and not onely a mouth to ſpeake by, but an eye to ſee by, and the footeway to goe by Chriſt is the life of the world,Ioh. 1.4. Heb 1.2. 2 King. 2.21. and the heire of all things; without whom I can poſſeſſe nothing that is good, either in grace or glory. Hee is the true Salt Eliza threw in to ſweeten the bitter waters of Iericho. Hee hath healed this water? Death ſhall no more come thereof to men, nor barrenneſſe to the ground.
                     And for the Law, it now leadeth vs out of our tents (as Moſes brought the people to trembling Sinai.
                        Exo. 19.17.18.) It bringeth  vs from reſt and quietneſſe, and haileth vs before the iudgement ſeate of God to receiue his wrath and ſentence of condemnation for our ſinnes.& 20.18.19. Then wee are affraid

(with the poore Iſraelites) and cry, let not the Lord ſpeake vnto vs, leaſt we die; but ſpeake thou O Moſes as a mediatour,Deut. 34.6. ſpeake thou O Chriſt. When we flie to Chriſt, Moſes and his law vaniſheth away; ſo that his Sepulchre can no where be found. So that Sinne and Death can hurt vs no more: for Chriſt is Lord ouer the Law, Sinne, and Death, to all beleeuers. Moſes muſt giue place to Chriſt: Death and Sinne can haue no roome; but grace, ioy, righteouſneſſe, life, faith, and peace muſt haue place with all true happineſſe and heauenly reſt. The Law now cannot condemne, nor ſaue; it reſtraineth vs from ſinning, as the bonds and chaines the Lion and Beare from tearing and deuouring. The Law is the Hammer of Death, the thundring of Hell, and lightning of Gods wrath, that beateth to powder the obſtinate and ſenſeleſſe Hypocrites, and hard-harted reprobates.Exod. 19.17. Heb. 12.18.19. This is the true vſe of the Law (by fearefull tempeſts, and ſound of a Trumpet, as in Synai) to terrifie; and by thunder to beate downe and rent in peeces that cruell monſter of mans righteouſneſſe. The Schoole-maiſter chaſtiſeth his Schollers; not to hurt them, but to reforme them.Gal. 3.24. The rod is ſharpe, but correction is neceſſarie; and the heart of the correctour louing. The Phyſitian giueth a bitter potion to his patient to cure him: the bitterneſſe is not to be imputed to the Phyſitian, but to the medicine and maladie. The Law condemneth the faithfull to death no more, but teacheth and inſtructeth them in their duetie, exhorteth and reproueth them, and procureth them by all meanes to goe to the Schoole of Chriſt.
                     
                         The Law and Chriſt are as the Phyſitian and Surgean, comming to a ſicke man to heale him. The Surgean openeth the veine, and taketh away the corrupt blood; not to kill him, but to recouer him to his health. The Law peirceth our impoſtumes and corruptions of ſinne, and Chriſt healeth the wound. But to ſeeke to be iuſtified by the Law, is, as if one hauing the Falling-ſickneſſe would ioyne to it the Peſtilence for his recouery. Or as if a

Leper ſhould come to one that had the leproſie to heale him: or as one begger to another to enrich them. So that they that ſeeke to be righteous by the Law, are twiſe more vnrighteous, weake and beggerly. If a man now could fulfill all the Law of God, yet could he not be ſaued, becauſe he was borne corrupt, and could not poſſibly pay for that was paſt, and in performing the Law afterward, he ſhould doe nothing but his duetie: but this is our comfort, that the Lord ſeeing our weakeneſſe hath (in his loue) paſſed by it,Gen. 6.5. and ſeeing our thoughts alwaies to be euill, taketh no accompt, or reckoning of vs; but we (reſembling the Image of his Sonne) the Lord reckoneth with him, and ſtriketh off our debts, in ſetting them on his ſcore; who hath paid the Lord his full due, euen to the vtmoſt farthing, being in his birth cleane, in his life holy, and in his death obedient.
                     We therefore that haue no goodneſſe of our owne, haue iuſt cauſe highly to extoll the goodneſſe of God, freely  giuen to vs in Ieſus Chriſt. For the truſting to our owne merites, is the reioycing of Sathan,
                           Auguſt.
                         the ſerpent that would ſting vs. But the faſtening of the firme Anchor of our hope, vpon Chriſt alone, is his ouerthrow and baine.Rom. 8.31. For as the Apoſtle exulteth, If God be on our ſide, who will be againſt vs.
                        1 Ioh. 5.4. This is the onely victorie that ouercommeth the world, euen our faith fixed on Chriſt. This is the ſling of Dauid to throw that mightie Goliah to the ground; yea, euen the weapon that ſlayeth him. Neither the Law then,1 Sam. 17.49.50. nor merits of men, nor any other meanes whatſoeuer, but onely the deſerts of Chriſt, take place in the worke of our redemption. The death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt is a ſoueraigne medicine againſt all diſeaſes of ſoule and body; the remembrance whereof doth much mitigate the feare and horrour of death: for hee that beleeueth in this crucified Sauiour, is already paſſed from death to life. By his vniuſt condemnation (which we onely haue deſerued, we are deliuered and abſolued at the iudgement ſeate of God: and by the death which he ſuffered, wee haue life,1 Pet. 3.2.
                        
and our death is aboliſhed. Chriſt ſuffered for our ſinnes, the iuſt for the vniuſt: he hath borne our ſinnes, and God hath laid our ſorrowes vpon him;Eſay 53.4.5. and by his ſtripes wee are healed. He hath died for vs, that wee might liue no more to our ſelues, but to him which died for vs; which we muſt doe by faith?Gal. 2.19.20. For faith preſenteth Chriſt before our eyes. It ſeeketh him out as a mighty Sampſon, which breaketh the gates of his enemies,Iudg. 16.3. and carrieth them away vpon his ſhoulders, who killed and deſtroyed more by his death then by his life.Verſe 30.
                     
                     
                         So that Chriſt alone being crucified did conquer the Diuell, being nailed to the croſſe, he cancelled the enditement of the law,Col. 2.14. laid againſt vs; and by dying he ſlaue Death and Sinne with their owne ſwords (as Dauid did Goliah,
                        1. Sam. 17.51.) and broke the Serpents head. Hee opened the Sepulchre, and gaue life vnto the dead; yea, he entred into the houſe of Death,Oſe 13.14. and Hell, and (like a ſtrong armed man) bereaued them of their forces.Math. 12.29. No ſooner was Ionah caſt into the Sea,Ionah. 1.15. but the tempeſt ceaſed; no ſooner was the paſchall Lambe ſlaine,Exod. 12.22.23. but the Iſraelites were deliuered: no ſooner was the high-Prieſts dead, but all baniſhed men returned home into their country.Numb. 35.25. What was this but a figure of Chriſt? by whoſe Death we haue all returne into our country, and deliuerance from all danger and deſtruction. Who would not lay his burden vpon him, that ſo deſireth to giue him eaſe. God would not haue the ſinner to die, and be damned, but to liue, and be ſaued. Haue wee had ſo many experiments of his loue, and ſhould wee now doubt thereof? Is the Iudge become our Aduocate, and ſhall wee feare to goe forward to the throne of grace? One deepe calleth another,Pſal. 42.7. and what is that (ſaith one;) There is a depth of mans miſerie, now at the gates of death, and there is a depth of Gods mercie, which is ready to heare and helpe all that call vpon him. Now miſerie calleth vpon mercie:Pal. 12.1. wee may cry, Helpe Lord, for beſides him there is none to helpe. It is not the peeces

and patches of our owne deſerts, that can make vs a garment to couer our nakedneſſe and ſinne: but it is the Scarlet-roabe that tooke ſo deepe a double dye in the bloud of Chriſt, that muſt now alone ſtand vs all in ſtead.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. III. The faithfull onely, and ſuch as are vnited to Chriſt, are redeemed from death, and reſtored to euerlaſting life: with the ſingular priuiledges and effects thereof.
                     
                        NOW as the benefit of our Redemption 
                           section 1 by Chriſt is great and vnſpeakable, performed onely by Chriſt himſelfe,Epheſ. 4.15.16. and his onely meanes; ſo none but his members are partakers thereof. Hee is the head,1 Cor. 12.27. the Church is his body, and euery faithfull man is a member for his part. And as there is no life in the body, but as it is vnited to the head, nor any motion in the members, being ſeparated from the body: So in Chriſt our head, conſiſteth our life, as we are true members of his body the Church, vnited to him by a true and liuely Faith, and ſo quickned by his Spirit, and knit and ioyned one to another (in a holy fellowſhip and communion) by the bond of loue. Chriſt is the Vine,Ioh. 15.5. Col. 3.14. and the faithfull his branches, without him they can doe nothing: as they are of this tree, they are fruitfull; but broken off they are barren, and liue no more, but dye and wither away: By his life alone wee liue, and without his death we are but dead and damned for euer.
                     Therefore wee muſt know and learne our true vnion 
                           section 2 with Chriſt, and try our ſelues whether wee be members of that body whereof hee is head. For none (I ſay) are redeemed from death, and freed from condemnation,Rom. 8.1. but thoſe alone that are in Chriſt; whom they cannot poſſibly apprehend but by a true and liuely Faith, which is

the ſpirituall hand to lay hold on Chriſts merits to eternall life. Hereby we are intereſſed in all that eyther God hath promiſed, or Chriſt hath performed: hence haue we from God, both forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and aſſurance of his fauour. This is the ground of our happineſſe and glory: hence of enemies wee become more then friends, euen the ſonnes of God,1 Ioh. 3.1. 1 Ioh 1.12. that may challenge not onely prouiſion and ſafe protection on earth, but an euerlaſting poſſeſſion and inheritance in heauen. The apprehenſion of Chriſts all-ſufficient ſatisfaction by a true and a liuely Faith, maketh it our owne, and vpon our ſatisfaction wee haue remiſſion, vpon remiſſion followeth reconciliation, vpon our reconciliation the peace of God which paſſeth all vnderſtanding.Phil. 4.7. When therefore our conſcience (like a ſterne and ſturdy Serjeant) ſhall catch vs (as it were) by the throat, and arreſt vs for Gods debt, our Plea muſt be, it hath beene paid, and ſo bring forth that bloudy acquittance ſealed vs from heauen, vpon our true and aſſured Faith. So ſhall the cruell looke of our Conſcience be changed into friendly ſmiles, and that rough and violent hand (ready to dragge vs downe to hell) ſhall euen louingly embrace vs, and fight for our righteous Crowne. Oh heauenly peace, and more then peace, whereby alone we are in league with our ſelues, and God with vs.
                     
                        
                           section 3 Gods Spirit ſheweth vs our pouerty, and where to buy Gold, that ſhall coſt vs nothing. It ſheweth vs our wretchedneſſe, that haue nothing but ragges to put on, and withall the wardrobe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, where we ſhall haue garments fit for Gods Saints. It ſheweth vs our Apoſtacie, how wee haue fallen, and by our fall haue euen broken our necke; and ſends vs to Chriſt our Phyſitian, who is onely good at ſuch a deſperate diſeaſe. It ſheweth vs our debt, and our Serjeant the Diuell to arreſt vs: and then ſends vs to the Lord-Treaſurer of heauen, in whoſe hands are ſufficient to diſcharge whatſoeuer wee owe.
                     
                        Gods Children then muſt be knit vnto Chriſt the Son 
                           section 4 of God: they liue in his life, and ſtand in his ſtrength, whoſe right hand hath made all things, and whoſe yeares endure for euermore: who is heyre of all things,Heb. 1.
                              •
                           . and ſhall ſhew vs his glory and immortalitie when all theſe creatures ſhall haue a change. There is no ſaluation nor ſanctification for vs vnder heauen, but as our nature is really vnited to the perſon of Chriſt the Sonne of God, who hath ſanctified and ſacrificed himſelfe for vs. Euen as our hands, armes, and other parts are not nouriſhed but onely by the meate receiued of the head: ſo our ſpirituall meate of life and righteouſneſſe, can no where elſe be deriued to vs, but from Chriſt our head. And as the veynes are meanes by which nouriſhment is conueyed to euery part: ſo Faith is the inſtrument by which we receiue from Chriſt all that is healthfull for our ſoules. And as by ioynts and ſinewes our members are really knit and made a compleat body vnto the head: ſo, really, truely, and indeed,Col. 2.19. by one Spirit wee be knit vnto Chriſt, and ſubſtantially made one with him,Epheſ. 2.22. & 4.4. as our naturall members are made one with our head.
                     This though wee cannot conceiue, yet wee are bound 
                           section 5 to beleeue. Wee now beleeue in the Lord our God, and yet wee know not his countenance: wee beleeue and apprehend by hope his glory, yet neyther eye can ſee it, no, nor heart conceiue it: wee beleeue the reſurrection of the dead, yet wee cannot vnderſtand ſuch excellent wiſdome, how our life ſhould be renewed in the diſſolued bones and ſcattered aſhes: Euen ſo wee beleeue that Chriſt and wee are one, hee of vs, and wee of him; hee the head, wee the body, really, ſubſtantially, and truely knit together, but not by ioynts and ſinewes (for that vniting we know) but by his Spirit, which all his Children haue; and this coniunction indeed can wee neuer fully comprehend, till wee know God as hee is, and his holy Spirit which hath wrought this bleſſing.
                     The diuine nature vnited to the manhood of Chriſt,

hath giuen the participation of his office to him as man, that as God is Mediator, ſo is man, as God hath deſerued ſaluation, ſo hath man; and that hee as man ſhall iudge the quicke and the dead; not that hee ſhall iudge by his manhood, but Chriſt man, ſhall iudge the world. This Chriſt is not onely God with vs in nature, but in perſon; for the reprobate are of the ſame nature with him, and he with them, yet is he not God with them, but againſt them. But wee (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) are fleſh of his fleſh,
                        Epheſ. 5.30. 
                        and bone of his bones: euen as a man and wife, which are not onely one in nature, but in perſon, by ſpeciall couenant; ſo are wee one with Chriſt by couenant of grace, and being one with him, wee are alſo one with the Trinitie. I pray thee O Father (ſaith Chriſt) as I am one with thee,
                        Ioh. 17.21.22. 
                        ſo theſe may be one with vs both, which bringeth great comfort to Gods Elect, that through Chriſt haue the whole God-head reconciled vnto them and dwelling in them.
                     
                        
                           section 7 And as Chriſt is our perſon and Sauiour, ſo his righteouſneſſe is ours, ſince we haue him whoſe it is; and this maintaineth Gods iuſtice to puniſh Chriſt in our perſon, and to iuſtifie vs in his, in reſpect hee is in vs, and wee in him; and ſo doth hee neyther puniſh the innocent, nor iuſtifie the offender. And in this reſpect, when wee know that Chriſt is truely ours,Iohn 1.4. that God giueth life, and this life is in the Sonne, and this Sonne is in vs; it followeth, that wee are not ſaued by his righteouſneſſe, but by our owne,2 Pet. 1.4. his perſon being made one perſon with vs. By regeneration wee are made partakers of his diuine nature, and fleſh, that is, our nature is renewed and ſanctified, and is made another fleſh, to wit, the fleſh of Chriſt. For as the Sonne of God was ſo made man,Heb. 4.15. that by nature hee was made like vnto vs in all things (ſinne onely excepted) ſo likewiſe are Chriſtians regenerate by his Spirit, cleanſed from ſinne in his bloud, that they being the body, may not be vnlike the head: but as the true husband and wife,Epheſ. 5.29.30. may both be but one fleſh, and of like nature and condition.
                     
                        Chriſt waſheth his Children (whom he will ioyne and 
                           section 8 couple to himſelfe) from their ſinnes: firſt, by his bloudſhed vpon the Croſſe,Apoc. 1.5. Heb. 9.14. hauing vndoubtedly obtayned of his Father remiſſion and forgiueneſſe of the ſame. Sanctifying them vnto himſelfe, by imputing vnto them and communicating with them his owne righteouſneſſe and holineſſe. Secondly, by the waſhing of the new birth,Epheſ. 5.26. Titus 3.5. hee ſanctifieth them, with reall and true holineſſe, making them holy indeed. As for reliques of ſin remaining, partly hee doth not impute them, and partly taketh away daily more and more,Epheſ. 5.27. till at length they be preſented (as his glorious Spouſe) in the kingdome of heauen, without ſpot and wrinckle. And as Adam acknowledged, and tooke no other to be his wife, then her that was taken and made of his owne ribbe:Gen. 2.23. no more doth Chriſt receiue any other to be of his Church, but thoſe that are taken out of his ſide vpon the Croſſe, that is, who are waſhed from their ſinnes in his bloud,Iohn 3.3.5.6. who are made new and regenerate by his Spirit. By order of nature, regeneration and renewing of the heart is firſt begunne in man by the holy Ghoſt, before hee can haue a true and liuely faith, which after is more and more perfected by the encreaſe of the Spirit: for what power hath a dead man to doe the workes of life? but truely to beleeue in Chriſt is a worke of life.
                     The whole perſon of the Sonne of God tooke into the 
                           section 9 vnitie of himſelfe whole man, that is to ſay, the whole humane nature▪ not fleſh alone, nor the ſoule alone, but both together▪ Therefore when Chriſt is vnited to euery faithfull man, the whole is vnited to the whole; whole Chriſt to the whole faithfull man. So that Chriſt is not the head and Sauiour to the Church, according to his diuine nature alone, nor onely according to his humane ſoule and body: but whole Chriſt, in his God-head, in his ſoule, and in his fleſh, is our head and Sauiour. Neyther is the ſoule alone of the faithfull, or the body alone ſaued by Chriſt, but both together, that is to

ſay, the whole faithfull man. And no man is made partaker of ſaluation, but by the vnion and coniunction which hee hath with Chriſt. Wherefore in this ſpirituall vnion, whole Chriſt is coupled with whole man.1 Tim. 3.16. A myſtery vnſpeakable, yet (I ſay) to be beleeued, that God cloathed in the fleſh ſhould come downe to man, and become man, that man might be exalted into the higheſt heauens, and that our nature might be taken into the fellowſhip of the Deity: that hee (to whom all Powers in heauen bowe, and thinke it their honour to be ſeruiceable) ſhould come downe to be a ſeruant to his ſlaues, a ranſome for his enemies; together with our nature taking vp our infirmities and ſhame, and bearing our ſinnes without ſinne. God offered peace to man, the holy ſeekes to the vniuſt, the Potter to the clay, the King to the traitor.
                     
                        
                           section 10 Chriſt hauing taken mans nature vpon him, not Angels,Heb. 2.6. and glorifying it with the roabe of his holy Reſurrection and Immortalitie, hath exalted the ſame aboue all Heauens, Angels, and Thrones, and placed it at Gods right hand. And ſince euery one of the faithfull hath a portion of fleſh in the body of Ieſus Chriſt, therefore where a piece of my fleſh is (ſaith Auguſtine) there I truſt to raigne,
                           Aug in ſoliloq.
                         where my fleſh is glorified, I know I ſhall be glorious: and where my fleſh doth rule, there I looke to haue dominion: and although I am yet a ſinner, yet I doubt not of this participation of grace. Although my ſinnes yet doe hinder mee, yet my ſubſtance doth require it: and although my offences (for a time) doe exclude mee, yet the communion of nature will not repell mee.
                     
                        
                           section 11 As by the fleſh of Adam corrupted, Sinne and Death ſpread ouer all; ſo by the fleſh of Chriſt ſanctified and vnited to the eternall God-head, Righteouſneſſe and Life is communicated vnto vs. The fleſh of Chriſt is the Arke, wherein dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the God-head corporally; by that, and from that, are all heauenly good things conueyed vnto vs:Col. 2.9. It is the inſtrument of the

God-head, yet ſo onely, being taken and ioyned inſeparably into the vnitie of the perſon. The God-head of Chriſt is as a fountaine whence all good things (as Life and Saluation) doe flow: but his fleſh and his humanitie is as it were the channell and conduit-pipe, by which all theſe good things doe come vnto vs. Which conduit of his fleſh vnleſſe we apprehend, and be vnited thereunto, wee cannot poſſibly partake of the waters of Gods graces flowing from the fountaine.Heb. 10.19.20. By his fleſh hee hath prepared a way for vs to heauen, to attaine vnto life, hauing rendred (in the ſame) moſt perfect obedience vnto God for vs, and by his death fully ſatisfied for our ſinnes, and through the remiſſion thereof giuen righteouſneſſe, and by righteouſneſſe the grace and fauour of God, and by grace life, that in aſſurance we may preſent our ſelues before the throne of God.
                     Wee muſt goe to Ieſus Chriſt that is God, by Ieſus 
                           section 12 Chriſt that is man; by the Word which was made,
                           Auguſt.
                         to the Word which was in the beginning with God;Iohn 1.1. and by the bread which men eate, vnto the meate which Angels eate. As Iacob came in Eſaus garment, to get Iſaacks bleſſing;Gen. 27.15.19 and as the high Prieſt neuer appeared without his holy garments and Ephod, in the Sanctuary of God:Exod. 28.43. ſo if we will be accepted and receiued of God, wee muſt not preſent our ſelues but in the royall roabes of Chriſts righteouſneſſe. Chriſt in our fleſh hath beene rayſed from the dead, and in our nature hath aſcended into heauen, that faithfull man (in his perſon) might be crowned with glory and honour. Hee hath carryed our fleſh into the preſence of God his Father, and it is no more poſſible to take this glory from vs, (as many as be one with him) then it is poſſible to pull away againe his perſonall humanitie from the perſon of his God-head.
                     And as no man aſcendeth vnto God, and is vnited vnto 
                           section 13 him, but by Chriſt the Mediator, and that by his fleſh: ſo God alſo doth communicate nothing with vs, but by the ſame Mediator, and that by his fleſh. The reaſon is,

becauſe euen in his fleſh our Redemption was wrought, Sinne deſtroyed,Col. 1. the Diuell vanquiſhed, Death ouercome, and eternall Life obtayned. And although our whole ſaluation and life doe depend on the fulneſſe of the God-head, which is in Chriſt, yet it is not communicated vnto vs but in the fleſh, and by the fleſh of Chriſt. Therefore (ſaith Chriſt) Except yee ſhall eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man,
                        Ioh. 6.53.56. 
                        you ſhall haue no life in you. Againe, Hee that eateth my fleſh dwelleth in mee, and I in him. Now it is all one to ſay, that Chriſt is in vs, and that hee abideth in vs, and to ſay with the Apoſtle,Epheſ. 3.17. that Chriſt dwelleth in our harts by faith. Hee is therefore in vs, and abideth in vs, and is vnited to vs by a liuely Faith. And as wee eate the true and naturall fleſh of Chriſt, ſo wee are vnited to the true fleſh of Chriſt: but the former is by Faith, therefore the latter alſo.
                     
                        
                           section 14 Againe, wee are not vnited but to a liuely and quickening fleſh; and this is the end why wee are vnited thereto, that being quickened thereby, wee may liue eternally. But the fleſh of Chriſt is not a quickening fleſh of it ſelfe,
                           Zanchius.
                         but ſo far forth as it was taken of the Son of God into the vnitie of the perſon. Our ſoule is ioyned to the ſoule of Chriſt, and our naturall fleſh with the fleſh of Chriſt, and therefore like vnto ours in all things (ſinne only excepted) which teacheth vs to faſten the eyes of our mindes immediately,Heb. 4.15. and firſt of all vpon the humane fleſh of Chriſt, as it were vpon the vayle,Heb. 10.20. by which the entrance was into the moſt holy place, where the glory of God moſt clearly ſhined; and then after that to enter into the Sanctuary it ſelfe to behold his Deity.
                     
                        
                           section 15 Furthermore, as Chriſt by the communication of his Spirit vniteth himſelfe vnto vs; ſo we by Faith are ioyned to him.1 Ioh. 4.13. For the firſt: By this wee know (ſaith S. Iohn) that Chriſt is in vs,
                        Rom. 8.9. 
                        euen by the Spirit which hee hath giuen vs. Hee that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt (ſaith S. Paul) hee is none of his.
                        Epheſ. 3.17. Ioh. 6.47.54. For the ſecond, (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) that Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by Faith. Hee that eateth my fleſh, and

drinketh my blood (ſaith Chriſt) abideth in me, and I in him: but hee is eaten and drunke by faith, as in the ſame place, Chriſt expoundeth. He that beleeueth in me ſhall neuer thirſt. We therefore are vnited to Chriſt by a liuely faith.
                     The knowledge and apprehenſion of which vnion with Chriſt, by a true and liuely faith, not onely miniſtreth a 
                           section 16 true euidence of our right and intereſt in Ieſus Chriſt: but putteth vs in poſſeſſion of all his benefits purchaſed to mankinde. Hence commeth aſſured remiſſion and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and by a neceſſary conſequence perfect deliuerance from eternall Death, by Chriſts obedience in Death: and likewiſe full and perfect poſſeſſion of eternall life, following his obedience, in fulfilling the Law. For both the parts of that obedience, which was really performed by Chriſt; is communicated to vs by imputation, and is truely made ours by the right of this ſpirituall vnion: ſeeing while Chriſt (how great ſoeuer hee be) is made one fleſh with vs, and we with him; and in regard thereof (by imputation alſo) we as the members together with Chriſt the head, are now crucified, are dead,Gal. 2.20. are buried, are raiſed from death, haue aſcended into heauen, doe ſit with him in the higheſt heauens, are bleſſed with Chriſt with all ſpirituall bleſſings,Eph. 1.3. and that not onely in hope, but already in Chriſt our head, wee are reputed for ſuch in heauen with God the Father.
                     Againe, two things neceſſarily concurre to the iuſtification 
                           section 17 of life. Firſt remiſſion of our ſinnes, that we be not found guilty of eternall death: Secondly, the imputation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, that we may be thought worthy of eternall life, and neither of theſe can be without the other; and both of them we haue of Chriſt. For the Lord Ieſus (of his grace and fauour towards vs) maketh that what things ſoeuer wee doe, by this his inherent righteouſneſſe communicated vnto vs, to make vs continually fruitfull, both to our ſelues and others, although they be moſt imperfect workes, and ſtained with the corruption of the fleſh; yet hee (I ſay) maketh that they be

pleaſing and acceptable to God, all our ſpots and blemiſhes being couered in the robes of Chriſts righteouſneſſe. And as Adams eating of the forbidden tree was imputed to all his poſteritie, though they neuer taſted of the fruit with their lippes: So the righteouſneſſe and obedience of Chriſt, ſhall make all faithfull men righteous before God,2 Cor. 5.21. though they themſelues as yet haue taſted no righteouſneſſe. For God hath made him ſinne for vs, that knew no ſinne, that wee ſhould be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. As therefore Chriſt was made ſinne for vs; not by infuſion of ſinne into his perſon, but by imputation of our ſinnes vnto him: ſo muſt wee be made righteous before God, not by infuſion of righteouſneſſe into our owne perſons;
                           Auguſt Contra Iul. pet. Pelag. l. 1. ca. 2. but by imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe vnto vs. As the Moone and Starres borrow all their light from the Sunne; ſo the Church and euery member of the ſame, borrow all their righteouſneſſe from Chriſt the Sonne of righteouſneſſe.
                     And as for the ſinnes of the faithfull, howſoeuer they 
                           section 18 cleaue vnto their bones; yet if they hate them as hell (from whence they are, the Diuell working them) they neede not care for them, being heauy in waight, and many in number: for they haue their hope not in their own perſon, but in the body of Chriſt,Rom. 6.5. into which they are grafted, and in which there is no ſpot, but perfection of righteouſneſſe, euen before God himſelfe. Their ſinnes by his meanes are put vnder their feete, and they are rulers ouer them. They are not imputed vnto them, but vnto Chriſt. The puniſhment of them is forgiuen vnto the faithfull, but not forgiuen to Chriſt. Righteouſneſſe is freely giuen vnto vs, but it was not freely giuen vnto him:Mat. 3.15. he obeyed the law of his Father, euery iot and tittle, that he might fulfill all righteouſneſſe. He bore the condemnation of hell and death, that he might aboliſh it. So that in him is life, in him is righteouſneſſe, in him is immortalitie,Luk. 214. and in him is the reconciled good will of God

to man. And that excellent wiſedome which hath made vs by faith, one with him: the ſame hath made vs partakers of all his honour and bleſſed immortalitie.
                     If we be ingrafted into the body of Chriſt, wee be his,
                           section 19 and he liueth in vs; his victory ouer all is ours, we ſee it by faith, and all things are in ſubiection vnder our feete. The Diuels doe challenge no good by Chriſt,Luk. 4.34. but diſclaime his mercies, perſon, and all his meanes: Oh what haue wee to doe with thee? but euery good Chriſtian may claime him as his due, with bleſſed Paul,
                        1 Cor. 1.30. and ſay that Chriſt is his righteouſneſſe, wiſedome, ſanctification, and redemption; and be bolde to affirme that though his body be in heauen, yet ſhall I there finde it mine: his diuinity on earth, yet there ſhall I feele it mine, &c. All is for mee, ſince Chriſt is mine. Things preſent, things to come, Life, Death, the world it ſelfe, all is ours, and we are Chriſts.1 Cor. 3.21.22.
                     
                     Chriſt in regard of this our vnion with him, is not aſhamed to call vs Brethren, who yet made heauen and earth,
                           section 20 and is an immortall and glorious God, one with his Father to whom all Angels doe obeyſance, and the moſt glorious Princes are but duſt and aſhes. It was a rare thing in Moſes (being ſo high in fauour with Pharao) that hee would vouchſafe to viſite his poore brethren (ſuch ſlaues and bond-men.Mat. 7.23.) It was ſingular loue in Ioſeph (being next to the King in honour and place) yet not to be aſhamed of his Fathers houſe, being herd-men and ſheepe-herds.Gen. 45.4. But this is nothing to the kindeneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt (the very ſhining brightneſſe of that moſt glorious God,Heb. 1.3. Col. 1.25. and his onely begotten Sonne before all eternitie) who yet was not aſhamed of vs miſerable wretched ſinners, but of his free grace acknowledged vs that were his very enemies; in whoſe perſon he ſhould ſuffer a moſt ſhamefull and ſlanderous Death. And is it not (trow you) a iuſt condemnation, if wee wretched men ſhould be aſhamed of him, who being the God of glory, was not aſhamed of vs? And as they are naturall brethren which are borne of the ſame Parents: ſo all wee are brethren with Chriſt

which are borne of God through the ſame ſpirit, by which we cry Abba Father, and exerciſe our loue one towards another in the vnitie of Chriſtian faith.
                     
                        
                           section 21 Wee wraſtle here with ſin as though the ſteppes of our ſtrength were reſtrained, and looke euen fully vpon death as the Ialour that committeth vs to our graue as a dungeon: how be it euen in this doth the Lord reach forth a moſt approued cordiall to reuiue the faintneſſe of our hearts; for through the vnion and communion we haue with Chriſt, the vncleaneneſſe of our birth is waſhed away in the ſanctification of his nature. Our tranſgreſſion remoued in his innocencie; our rebellion diſcharged in his obedience, and the vtmoſt farthing paid in his ſufferings. And hauing the Image of God (which we loſt in Adam) not renewed onely, but a fairer and deeper ſtampe thereof ingrauen and ſet vpon vs: we may in a Chriſtian reſolution challenge at the gates of Hell and Death, that nothing can be charged vpon vs as a debt, and therefore nothing can light vpon vs as a puniſhment. Wherefore though we mingle here our bread with care, and drinke with weeping, and haue our lodging in the bed of darkeneſſe and diſcomfort: it is but to weane vs from the fleſh-pots of Egypt, till in the heauenly land of Canaan we haue our hearts deſire.
                     
                        
                           section 22 And though our bodies ſeeme to periſh for euer (in (in the iudgement of men) yet ſtill they haue a being in the ſight of God, and are members of Chriſt: For the vnion (as I haue ſaid) betweene Chriſt and the faithfull, is not onely of our ſoules, but of our bodies alſo; all the bodies of the faithfull being vnited to the bodie of Chriſt. And this is ſuch a coniunction as Death can neuer diſſolue.Rom. 7.2. For though it doth breake the knot betweene Man and Wife; yet cannot it infringe the bond betwixt Chriſt and the faithfull. As Death did not make a ſeparation betwixt the two natures of Chriſt, at the time of his ſuffering, though his ſoule and body were then farre diſtant in regard of place (the one being in heauen, and the other

in the graue) yet were they at that time, and in that caſe perſonally vnited vnto his god-head: no more can Death make a diuiſion betwixt Chriſt and the faithfull, though there bodies putrifie and rot in their graues; yet ſtill they remaine true members of his body.
                     And as the Husbandman doth make as great reckoning 
                           section 23 of that corne which he hath ſowen in his Field, and lieth vnder clods, as hee doth of that which lieth ſafe in his barne, or garner; becauſe he aſſureth himſelfe it will come vp againe, and yeelde encreaſe: So Chriſt our Sauiour doth as highly eſteeme of thoſe bodies which are dead and buried, as of thoſe which remaine aliue, becauſe hee knowes that one day they ſhall riſe againe in honour. Their life is but hid for a time, and will be found out againe: for Chriſt is able to reſtore that which nature hath deſtroyed. And God doth deale herein no otherwiſe with the bodies of his children, then Goldſmiths with their old peeces of plate long agoe out of faſhion; who caſt them in the Furnace, to refine them, and to bring them to a better forme, according to his minde.
                           Chryſoſt. in Mat. hom. 35. & in 1 Theſ. 4. Therefore let not the wofull condition of our bodies diſcourage vs any whit, or leſſen our hope, being ready to die.
                     For though the graue deuoure them, wormes doe eate 
                           section 24 them, fire conſume them, or ſea ſwallow them vp: yet being ioyned to Chriſt in his death and reſurrection (as Chriſt and Chriſtians are made one indiuiſible body, by the bond of Gods ſpirit) they can neuer be ſeuered from him. And although their bodies be (as it were) rent from the ſoule, by the violence of Death; yet in regard of this coniunction with Chriſt their head: neither death, nor the graue can ſeparate them from their head. For though our bodie be buried in the earth, yet our head is in heauen. And as one that ſwimmeth (though his body diue and ſinke vnder the water) yet his head being aboue the ſtreames, the whole man is ſure and ſafe from periſhing. So ſure are the faithfull from euerlaſting death and deſtruction (though their bodies be entrenched and enterred in their

graues) being members of their head Ieſus Chriſt, aſcended aloft, aboue the higheſt heauens; to whom they are vnited ſtill, by an inſeparable bond of his ſpirit, which death can neuer breake.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IIII. The combat and conflict of Chriſtians with Sinne, Fleſh, Death, Law, and Diuell, with their heauenly conqueſt and triumph ouer them all, through Ieſus Chriſt.
                     
                        
                           section 1
                        SVch is the enmitie of the old Serpent (in the iuſt, iudgement of God) ſet betweene him and Adams ſeede, that though his head be broken, yet ſtill he will labour to bruiſe their heele.Gen. 3.15. Like a coward ouercome, he lags behinde for aduantage; and not daring to ſhew his face any more in the field, hee dragges in the way, and lieth aloofe (vpon euery occaſion) to take them in a trappe. Though he cannot preuaile, yet prouoke vs ſtill hee will to fight, and try our manhood: neither can wee otherwiſe be conquerours, then was Chriſt our Captaine, and head; who by dying in the field, recouered life both for himſelfe and his Souldiers; for nothing but Death can end this combat.
                     Our life is a warfare, and that moſt ſtrange; for any 
                           section 2 other warre may haue an end,Iob 7.1. either by a concluſion of peace with the enemie, or by flying farre from him, or by ouercomming him in fight. But in this ſpirituall warre we cannot lawfully make any peace with theſe our enemies, the Diuell, World, and Fleſh, &c. For ſo it would proue our ouerthrow and deſtruction; they being vnto vs ſo many traitours, and irreconcileable murtherers. It would be worſe for vs, then for the ſilly Sheepe to make peace with the Wolues. Neither yet can we flee, and ſo get from them: for the Diuell will purſue vs into euery place (with his whole armies and huge hoaſts of his olde tryed and

trayned Souldiers to inuade vs: within vs are our corrupt affections, and couetous luſts, as his hirelings. And whereſoeuer we become in this life, theſe our enemies will finde vs out; therefore we muſt fight or be foyled, wee muſt ouercome, or be conquered. This warre reſembles the battels of the Iſraelites,Deut. 17. & 20▪ 16. againſt the Kings and inhabitants of Canaan, they muſt deſtroy them, peace they might not make, or admit them tributaries: yet Gods people were commanded not to feare them, nor to retire into Egypt: therefore of neceſſitie they muſt fight to ouercome them. True it is (conſidering our owne nature) that wee haue iuſt cauſe to feare ſo ſtrong and mighty enemies: but as God in old time encouraged Ioſuah, that he ſhould not be affraide, in aſſuring him of his preſence ſo muſt we manfully ſtand in this combat, and in Chriſt (our true Ioſuah and captaine Ieſus) wee ſhall be more then conquerours.
                     And as the Diuill (with his armies) maketh war againſt all mankinde: ſo eſpecially he fighteth againſt Chriſt the 
                           section 3 head, and his faithfull members. The woman with her Son, he ſeeketh to drowne and ouerwhelme with a flood & ſea of temptations:Apoc. 12.15.16 As Sathan tempted Chriſt when hee was baptiſed, and filled with the holy Ghoſt:Math. 4. ſo will hee ſtill purſue the beſt Chriſtians which haue receiued of God the greateſt graces and gifts. As Theeues rob not beggers, but rich men;
                           Chriſoſt.
                         and Pyrats purſue thoſe Ships the moſt that are of deareſt priſe: ſo the Diuell would make a prey of ſuch, eſpecially as are furniſhed with faith, and other heauenly pearles of greateſt value. In any commotion whom doe rebels moſt indeauour to kill and ſpoyle, but thoſe eſpecially that are faithfull to their Prince, and will fight for their Country? Now the Diuell is a rebell in the Lords kingdome: whom then will hee moſt trouble, but the godly which are Gods faithfull ſouldiers, to fight his battels againſt him? He that will raigne with Chriſt in heauen, muſt ouercome the Diuell on earth.
                     The Diuell is a Peripateticke (ſaith one) alwaies walking 
                           section 4
                        
and going about,1 Pet. 5.8. ſeeking whom he may enſnare, and all is fiſh that comes to his net. Our hearts being as deepe riuers, and the Diuell being no more able to diſcerne the thoughts thereof, then the Angler can deſcry what fiſh is in the water (for the ſecrets of all hearts are onely knowne to God,) hee baiteth a hooke for vs, and by the going downe of the line, he knoweth we are ſped. If he ſee any couetouſly giuen, he ſetteth riches before him; if any be ambitious, he offereth titles and preferments, &c. He hath manifold nets of temptations, ſometimes beſetting vs with vaine pleaſures and ſometimes incirkling vs with inordinate ſorrow and care; now fetching vs in with feare, and anone pricking vs forward with pride and preſumption: As he findeth vs affected, ſo he fitteth his baites, and by our ready and greedy apprehenſion of his temptations▪ he effecteth our deſtruction: And as a cunning Fiſher (knowing how to hold the fiſh he hath hooked) he will giue them line and libertie, but yet they ſhall walke no further then he liſt, that he may draw them backe againe at his pleaſure: as the childe playeth with the bird tyed by the legge, not ſuffering her to flye but the length of the thread. Therefore the baite that he layeth for vs, being our bane, let vs not come within the length of his line, or within the compaſſe of his nets. Let Gods word rather be our baite and hooke to catch vs, which being taken, taketh vs, and happy is he that is taken therewith, no to his ſlaughter with the fiſh, but to the ſaluation of his ſoule with the faithfull.
                     
                        
                           section 5 The Diuell wayeth well our old wants, the courſe of our cares, the faſhion of our affections, and out of the nature of our qualities, worketh his malignities; like a ſubtile Souldier trayned vp in the warres▪ that layeth ſiege to that place of the wall that is weakeſt. He obſerueth our infirmities, and taketh aduantage of them. As a man when he would ſtrike fire out of a flint marketh which end of it is fitteſt for the ſtroake of the Iron, that it may ſparkle the ſooner▪ So this ſubtile Serpent obſerueth that affection

that leaneth to ſinne; and that he ſmiteth with his iron of temptation, that a ſparke of our conſent thereunto being added, the flame of ſinne may ſooner be kindled, to conſume the whole man. Hee ſeeth euery ones complection, and ſo accordingly applyeth his temptation. One man is giuen to ſolace, another to ſorrow; one to feare, another to pride, &c. Let vs therefore be as wiſe for our ſaluation, as hee is wily to worke our damnation. Sathan by worldly baites and ſleights leadeth many thouſand ſinners blindefold to perdition, as a Faulken or carryeth his Hawkes quietly on his fiſt, being hooded, which otherwiſe he could not ſo eaſily doe if they had they ſe and ſight of their eyes.
                     And as Sathan aſſayleth vs all the dayes of our life; 
                           section 6 ſo is hee, and will be, moſt buſie at the houre of death: who dealeth (as Tenants doe when their Leaſes are ready to expire, then they racke and take all things to the vtmoſt, they make money of any commoditie, they ſcrape to themſelues by hooke and by crooke whatſoeuer they can; ſo fareth it with Sathan. The time of death is the laſt houre of the world, and then hee playeth reakes, hee ruffleth it apace, as though hee were wood. And no maruell why hee taketh the greateſt aduantage at our death: for then hee muſt ouercome, at that inſtant, or not at all: then his rage is great, becauſe his time is ſhort.Reuel. 12.12. Thus being acquainted with Sathans wylineſſe, and watchfulneſſe to doe vs hurt (eſpecially at our latter end;) let vs now further diſplay his manner of fight in the field, and his Souldiers and weapons that hee imployeth in this warre againſt vs.
                     Now the Diuell in his Plea againſt vs, for our iuſt condemnation 
                           section 7 and death, bringeth in the Law, euen the moſt righteous Law of God, which man hath tranſgreſſed, and by tranſgreſſion thereof challengeth to hold him in his kingdome. From whence he thus reaſoneth againſt our ſaluation: Whoſoeuer breaketh the Law of God ſhall dye the death: But euery man hath broken the Law of

God: Therefore ſhall euery man dye the death. And by the vertue of the Law (ſaith Sathan) I will hold him in death. The Law is according to Gods nature, good, holy, and righteous, and therefore the death of man ponounced by the Law is iuſt, and his condemnation righteous. God the Law-giuer is infinit & eternall, and ſo his Iuſtice offended; therefore his death (by tranſgreſſing) muſt be endleſſe and euerlaſting. God is iuſt, and cannot deny himſelfe: Hee hath ſaid, that if man breake his Law, he ſhould dye the death, and therefore death ſhall hold him. God is perfect and pure, and therefore the ſatisfaction muſt be anſwerable to his nature. His righteous Law bindes both ſoule and body to obedience, euen euery mans thoughts, words, and workes: and therefore let euery man performe this, and hee ſhall liue.
                     
                        
                           section 8 Theſe and many moe are the darts of the Diuel, which hee caſteth againſt our ſoules to wound vs to death, the leaſt of which aſſuredly would peirce vs through, were it not that the ſtrength of Ieſus Chriſt rebounds them back, and blunts them. Hee alone is our ſhield and buckler, our helmet of ſaluation, our Caſtle and houſe of defence: hee couereth vs with his wings, and wee are ſafe vnder his feathers: his faithfulneſſe and his truth ſhall ſtill preſerue vs. For all theſe dangerous darts and a thouſand moe are nothing to his power; their force is leſſe, and their violence weaker then ſtraw or ſtubble to the furnace.
                     But to haſten the anſwere: Gods Iuſtice indeede is 
                           section 9 gone out, it cannot be reuerſed. Man muſt keepe his Law, or man muſt dye eternall death. Whereupon it pleaſed the onely Sonne of God to become the ſonne of man for our ſakes, and ſo as man to ſatisfie the Law of God for our ſinnes, that Gods truth might not be altered. No Angell nor Saint could be our Sauiour in this caſe, but man who had offended God: Now man of himſelfe being too weake to beare this heauy weight, Chriſt being God, became alſo man (as we haue heard) that ſo hee might ſuffer as man, and ſaue as God. Our Mediator was God

and man: Man and God were foes, and therefore being God and man, hee reconciled man to God. And as the firſt Adam by tranſgreſſing brought death vpon all men; ſo Chriſt the ſecond Adam by obaying brought life to all beleeuers. Gods pureſt Iuſtice could not exact the thing which he fulfilled not: It required the performance of the Law, this hee accompliſhed, being the end of the Law and the Prophets. Hee was the ſubſtance of all the old Ceremonies, and the very body of all the ſhadowes of the Law. Hee was circumciſed and baptiſed,Luke 2.24. and ſo fulfilled all righteouſneſſe: hee paid tribute,Math. 3. and was obedient in all things, and was vnder the Law; ſo his comming was not to breake the Law, but to fulfill the Law. As it required perfect holineſſe in man, ſo hee was a man without ſinne; conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, therefore hee was not afraid to ſay to the faces of his foes,Math. 27.24. 
                        Which of you can rebuke mee of ſinne? Yea, the Iudge himſelfe that condemned him waſhed his hands (as a witneſſe of his cleanneſſe) I finde no fault in this iuſt man. True therefore is the ſaying of the Apoſtle, that hee was made ſinne for vs,
                        2 Cor. 5. 
                        which knew no ſinne, that wee might be made the righteouſneſſe of God through him. He is truely called the Paſchall Lambe, moſt pure and vnſpotted, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.
                        1 Pet. 1.11
                              •
                           . Ioh. 1.36. 
                        To him all the Prophets beare witneſſe, that iuſtly through his name is preached remiſſion of ſinne:
                        Acts 4.12. 
                        and that there is no other name vnder heauen by which we can be ſaued.
                     
                     Thus hee fulfilled the Law for man which had broke 
                           section 10 the Law, being man himſelfe▪ His obedience was moſt perfect: he left nothing vnfulfilled. And as hee kept the Law which man had broken; ſo likewiſe did he beare the puniſhment which hee deſerued. The breach of the Law was the curſe of God and eternall death:Gal. 3.13. 
                        He therefore became accurſed, and ſuſtained death, euen the death of the Croſſe accurſed of God: and ſo by death ouercame death, and by his curſe brought the bleſſing of God vpon vs. Hee cancelled the hand-writing that the Diuell had againſt vs:Col. 2.14. hee nayled it to his Croſſe, and made it void, ſo that now

the faithfull may triumph through Chriſt, (Death being ſwallowed vp in victory,) they may boldly exclaime and ſay,1 Cor. 15. 
                        O Death, where is thy ſting! O Graue, where is thy victory! for the ſting of Death being Sinne, and the ſtrength of Sin being the Law, and both Sin and Law being aboliſhed through Chriſt, there is now no condemnation that remaineth:Rom. 8.1. and therefore thankes be to God who hath giuen vs the victory through Ieſus Chriſt:1 Cor. 15. for hee hath taken our ſinnes vpon his backe; hee hath ſatisfied the Law of God, not for himſelfe, but for vs; hee dyed, that wee might liue; hee was accurſed, that wee might be bleſſed; he was buryed and roſe againe, that wee might riſe from our graues, and liue for euer; hee deſcended into hell, that wee might aſcend to heauen: his righteouſneſſe is our righteouſneſſe, and our ſinnes are his; this exchange did hee make for our ſakes. And therefore (through Faith) by him wee are reuiued, quickened, and ſtrengthened. All his merits are imputed vnto vs as though they were our owne, and our ſinnes are truely his, for which he ſuffered and ſatisfied to the vtmoſt.
                     
                        
                           section 11 Chriſt Ieſus (I ſay) is our onely ſatisfaction and ſacrifice,Zach. 13.1. Pſal. 16.5. 1 Cor. 1.30. Col. 2.27. Ioh. 10.9. Rom. 3.25. the fountaine of grace and vertue, the portion of our inheritance, our righteouſneſſe, wiſedome, ſanctification, and redemption; our hope of glory, our doore to heauen; the way, the truth, and the light; our attonement vnto God, our Shepheard, Maſter, Lord, and King. To be ſhort, hee is all in all to vs that are nothing. This our Sauiour Chriſt hath abrogated the Law, and hath redeemed thoſe that were vnder the Law, and hee himſelfe is the end of the Law, and that which the Law could not doe, hee hath accompliſhed in his perſon. And therefore O Diuell let Gods people goe, for the Law cannot hold them: And therefore O death reſigne thy power, thy ſting and ſtrength is nothing, the Law being fulfilled, and Sinne remoued. The ſeede of the woman hath bruiſed the Serpents head:Gen. 4.15. Epheſ. 4.8. Chriſt hath ledde captiuitie captiue, and giuen gifts vnto men. He hath reconciled (and

made as one) all things both in heauen and earth. Hee hath quite plucked downe the partition wall, in abrogating (through his fleſh) the hatred that remayned. There is now neyther Iew nor Gentile, bond nor free, Scythian nor Barbarian, man nor woman, all (that beleeue) are one in Chriſt.Eſay 11.6.7. Hee hath made the Wolfe to dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard to lye with the Kid; he hath made the Calfe, the fat beaſts, and the Lyon ſo tame, that a little childe may lead them; the Cow, and the Beare, with their young ones, not onely feede but lye together; the ſucking childe doth play vpon the hole of the Aſpe; yea, euen the weaned childe moſt ſafely putteth his hand into the hole of the Cockatrice. Chriſt hath now diſſolued the workes of the Diuell, and broken his ſnares aſunder, that all beleeuing ſinners might be made righteous through him, wayting for eternall life. He hath opened the eyes of the blinde, and brought the priſoners from the dungeon; and him that ſate in darkneſſe, hath hee placed in light.
                     To conclude, by his triumph on the Croſſe hee deſtroyed 
                           section 12 Sinne, and ſo was Death in the ſame victory maimed: For Sinne (as was ſaid) is the ſting of Death, and when Death had loſt his ſting, and was conquered in Chriſts reſurrection from death, Sathan alſo loſt his ſtrength and power, which reſted vpon them which through ſinne were in danger of death. Finally, becauſe Hell onely deuoureth them, which through Sinne and Death are ſlaues to Sathan; it followeth, that the other three by Chriſt being ſo mightily vanquiſhed, that hell alſo (with all the torments thereof) were vtterly ſubdued, and the faithfull deliuered. And ſo (according to the ſaying of Zachary) God hath performed the Oath which hee ſware to deliuer vs from our enemies,
                        Luke. 1.32.33. 
                        that wee might ſerue him without feare, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, all the dayes of our life. Now then, all wee which beleeue, are freed from the ſlauery of Sinne, kingdome of the Diuell, gulfe of Hell, and chaines of Death; ſo that henceforth Death is no death to

Gods Children (through Chriſt) but great aduantage, and appoynted for a paſſage to a better life. And therefore though curſed reprobates may tremble at the name of Death and Diuell, (to whom they are in thraldome,) yet Gods Children being conquerours through Chriſt, may well triumph: for now through him, wee haue an entrance made to heauen; and Death is the very doore of life, a paſſage out of this world to the Father, a freedome from the priſon of this body to goe to Chriſt: It is a returning to our heauenly Countrey, from which wee were exiled: This is the cauſe why the godly ſigh and ſorrow to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt.
                     
                        
                           section 13 If Sathan therefore charge vs (as ſurely hee will) with the greatneſſe of our crimes, then turning to God, let vs pray, that hee will turne away his face from our ſinnes, and not looke vpon vs, as wee are in our ſelues, but in the face of Ieſus Chriſt that redeemed vs from our ſinnes. If hee ſay that our ſinnes are more then the ſands of the ſea, let vs conſider that his mercies are more, and moſt infinite, and looke what ſinne can doe againſt Chriſt, ſo much can it doe againſt me which beleeue in Chriſt: for I am in him, and hee in mee, and therefore am righteous through Chriſt, who is a condemning ſinne, to condemne thee (O Sathan) which art a condemned ſinner. If hee ſay it is abſurd, for an vniuſt and wicked man, to expect the reward of righteouſneſſe; let vs anſwere that Chriſt is our righteouſneſſe and redemption,
                           Bernard.
                         and that we ſhall neuer be without merits, ſo long as Chriſt is not without mercies. But from whence haſt thou this hope? Becauſe I haue a good Lord, an exorable Iudge, and a gracious Aduocate. But thou ſhalt be ſwallowed vp of death? No, my Redeemer liueth, and my head is in heauen, who I am ſure will draw mee to him: Chriſt hath ouercome Death, and opened to mee the gate of Life. O Death thou wouldeſt haue killed him with the ſting of ſinne; but being of no force, thy ſtrength hath failed, and hee being my life is become thy death. And though

Death (like a proud Goliah) dareth the whole world,1 Sam. 17. to match him with an equall Champion; and whileſt the whole hoaſt of worldlings ſhew him their backes for feare, yet the true and humble Chriſtian (with Faith and reſolution in Chriſt) dare ſhew his face and ſtand to the fight, till hee haue foyled him, and wounded him in the fore-head, (as Dauid the great Gyant,) euen the wonted ſeate of terrour and feare, and trampling him vnder foot, can cut off his head with his owne ſword, victoriouſly triumphing ouer him. A moſt admirable victory we dye, and are not foyled; yea, we are conquerours in dying: for we could not ouercome Death if we dyed not.
                     But thou ſhalt be damned, ſaith the Diuell? Sathan,
                           section 14 thou art a falſe accuſer, and no vpright Iudge; one that art damned thy ſelfe, and not a condemner of others. But the Law of thy God, accuſeth and condemneth thee? Sathan, Chriſt hath fulfilled it, and giuen his ſatisfaction vnto mee; to him I onely cleaue, who hath fulfilled it, ſo that I my ſelfe haue nothing to doe with it: I haue another Law which ſtriketh it downe, euen the Law of libertie, which (through Chriſt) maketh mee free: For my Conſcience which henceforth ſerueth the Law of Grace, is as a glorious Prince to triumph ouer the Law of Wrath. But ſee how many Legions of Diuels looke for thy ſoule, as Death for thy body? I denye it not, and ſhould therefore deſpayre, but that I haue a ſtrong protector, who hath vanquiſhed their tyrannie and helliſh hatred againſt mee. Yea, but God is vniuſt if hee beſtow eternall life vpon malefactors? Nay, hee is rather iuſt in keeping his promiſe, and I haue long agoe appealed from his Iuſtice to his Mercy. But thou flattereſt thy ſelfe with vaine hope? No, the Truth cannot lye to mee, (Sathan) and it is thy propertie to deceiue. Oh but thou ſeeſt what thou leaueſt in the world, but what after this life thou ſhalt inioy thou knoweſt not? I tell thee Sathan, theſe things that are ſeene are temporall and momentany,Heb. 11.1. but the things (which as yet I ſee not, yet hope aſſuredly to

inioy,) are eternall and pearleſſe. Againe, hee doth more then ſee which firmely beleeueth. But (alas!) thou goeſt hence laden with euill deedes, and deſtitute of good? Yet will I intreat my Chriſt to vnburden mee of the euill, and to cloath mee with his good.Iohn 9. Ezech. 18. But God heareth not ſinners? I know hee heareth penitent ſinners, and for ſuch hee dyed. But thy repentance is too late? No, it is neuer too late in this life to turne to God, as we truely learne by the theefe vpon the Croſſe. But thy Faith is weake and ready to fayle thee? Yet I will pray to God for the increaſe and ſtrengthening of it, and then it ſhall neuer fayle mee.
                     
                        
                           section 15 But how canſt thou be perſwaded of Gods fauour, who doth thus torment thee with ſickneſſe? God doth it in fauour and loue (Sathan,) as the good Phyſitian giueth the bitter Potion, to cure his Patient: and wee ſee that for the obtayning of bodily health, we are content not onely to admit any loathſome Pils, and vnſauory Receipts, but alſo (if neede require) to ſpill and ſpare ſome part of our bloud: how much more ſhould wee hazard for the recouery of the eternall health and ſaluation of our ſoules? But this cup of teares & tribulations ſhall be ſo tempered in meaſure, by our heauenly Phyſitian, as that no man ſhall taſte thereof aboue his ſtrength: This doſe of Aloes and other bitter ingrediences, (I meane the very cup of death itſelfe) ſhall be qualified with heauenly Manna, and ſufficient ſweetneſſe of ioy and conſolation. And ſeeing that God my louing Father tempered this Potion for mee, and Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne hath begunne vnto mee, ſhall I not drinke it with thankfulneſſe and comfort? But why will hee haue thy death ſo bitter and ſharpe? It is my Lord who can and will wiſh me nothing but good; and why ſhould I (his poore and vnprofitable ſeruant) refuſe to ſuffer that which the Lord of glory, and my bleſſed Sauiour ſuſtained himſelfe? But it is a miſerable thing to die? No, the death of Gods Saints is precious in the ſight of of God,Apoc. 14. and the ready way to eternall life; Bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord, for (ſo ſaith the Spirit,) they ſhall

reſt from their labours? But the death of ſinners is damnable? Yea, but he is no more a ſinner that truely repenteth and is pardoned.
                     Let not Sathan tell Gods children what they haue beene, but what they would be: for ſuch we are by imputation,
                           section 16 as we are in affection; and he is now no ſinner, which for the loue he beareth to righteouſneſſe, would be no ſinner. Such as we be in deſire and purpoſe, ſuch wee be in reckoning and accompt with God, who giueth that true deſire and holy purpoſe to none, but to his children, whom he iuſtifieth. Neither vndoubtedly can the guiltineſſe of ſinne breake the true peace of conſcience, ſeeing it is the worke of another, who hath commended vs as righteous before God, and ſaued vs. It muſt needes be graunted that in our ſelues we are weaker then that we can reſiſt the leaſt ſinne: ſo farre off is it that we can encounter with the Law, Sinne, Death, Hell, and Diuell, and yet in Ieſus Chriſt we are more then conquerours ouer them all.
                     If Sathan ſummon thee therefore to anſwere for thy 
                           section 17 debt; ſend him ſtraight to Chriſt thy pledge, and ſay that the wife is not ſueable, but the husband; therefore enter thy action (Sathan) againſt Chriſt my husband, and he will anſwere thee. Who then ſhall condemne vs, or what Iudge ſhall daunt vs, ſith God hath acquitted vs, and Chriſt (that was condemned) hath iuſtified vs? He is our Iudge, that willeth not the death of a ſinner: hee is our man of law, that (to excuſe vs) ſuffered himſelfe to be accuſed for vs. O gluttenous hell, where is thy defence! O cruell ſinne, where is thy tyrannous power! O rauening death, where is thy bloody ſting! O roaring Lyon, why doeſt thou fret and fume? Chriſt my law, fighteth againſt thee O law, and is my libertie: Chriſt my ſinne, againſt thee O ſinne, and is my righteouſneſſe. Chriſt warreth againſt thee O Diuell, and is my Sauiour. Chriſts Death is againſt thee O Death, and is my life. Thou diddeſt deſire to paue my way to the burning lake of damned ſoules; but contrary to thy will, thou art conſtrained to lift vp the

Ladder whereby I muſt aſcend to euerlaſting happineſſe and ioy.
                     In our tryals and temptations, we muſt firſt ſearch out 
                           section 18 the cauſe, and aſcend to God, pleading guilty, and crauing mercy at his hand? and not ſo much ſtand quarrelling with the corruption of our nature, and Sathans malice againſt vs. For as it were no good wiſedome for a man condemned to die, to make any long ſuite to the Iaylour or hangman, (for they be but vnder-officers, and can doe nothing of themſelues) but muſt rather labour to the Iudge himſelfe, who can either repriue, or releaſe him: ſo it is no good pollicie to ſtand reaſoning ſo long with Sathan in our temptations, who doth all by conſtraint and reſtraint vnder God our Lord, in whoſe onely hands are both the entrance and iſſues of all afflictions, and Death it ſelfe.
                     
                        
                           section 19 Whatſoeuer ſcruple therefore ariſeth from our ſelues, or is inferred of Sathan, from any imperfection that is in vs, it neede not at all diſmay vs, becauſe wee ſaue not our ſelues, but are ſaued by him, who is made vnto vs from God wiſedome,
                           
                              •
                           . Cor. 1.30. righteouſnes, Sanctification and redemption, that who ſo glorieth, ſhould glorie in him. Thus we muſt ſend Sathan to Chriſt, who is our aduocate to pleade and defend our cauſe, which yet is not ſo much ours, as his owne, becauſe the queſtion is not of our merits, or ſatisfactions (which we freely renounce) but of the merits of his obedience, and of the value of his Death vnto the ſaluation of the ſoules of all the faithfull. Thus ſhall we at once for euer ſtop the mouth of this our cruell enemie, when refuſing to pleade our owne cauſe, we referre our ſelues vnto Chriſt, whom we know to be the wiſedome of God,3. Sam. 17. and ſufficient to anſwere what poſſibly can or ſhall be obiected againſt vs. When Dauid comes to fight with Goliah, he caſteth away Sauls armour; all confidence in the world or man is laid aſide, and he onely truſteth in God.
                     
                        
                           section 20 Doth the Law indite vs of tranſgreſſion? we muſt make our appeale to the court of Conſcience in heauen, and

there get a Superſede as to ſtay the courſe of Law, and ſo appeale to the throne of grace: from the Law of feare, to the Law of loue (as Auguſtine ſpeaketh.
                           Auguſt.
                        ) Doth the aduerſarie vrge our debt? our anſwer is, the obligation is cancelled and the booke is croſſed; and the whole ſum diſcharged. Chriſt hath paſſed his word, nay, he hath paid all that is due for vs, to the vtmoſt farthing. Let vs ſhew him our generall acquittance vnder hand and ſeale, giuen vs by God himſelfe, with whom it is as proper to ſhew pittie, as mercie to helpe miſery. This is my wel beloued Son,
                        Mat. 3.17. 
                        in whom I am wel pleaſed. Here is the creditours owne word, his owne handwriting vnder ſeale: this is a very good quietus eſt in Law, it is proclaimed from heauen, and therefore ſufficient to comfort poore diſtreſſed ſinners vpon earth.Mat. 7. The houſe built vpon a rocke was not moued when the ſtormes beate and the windes blew. Chriſt is our ſure rocke, let vs builde our faith vpon him, and we ſhall be ſafe.
                     Men cannot be more ſinfull then God is mercifull, if 
                           section 21 with penitent hearts they faithfully call vpon him. If wee come to Chriſt the fountaine of all mercies, there ſhall we finde God in his mediation, great without quantitie, and good without quality (as an auncient ſpeaketh.
                           Auguſt.
                        ) When the wandring Sonne had conſumed his fathers ſubſtance, yet returning ſorrowfull, his father receiued him: and though we ſometime looſe the nature of children; yet God doth neuer looſe the name and nature of a father. To conclude, the Diuell once ouercome, giues a freſh aſſault againe, he will neuer giue vs ouer, till death end the battell, and then he ſhall be foyled. As it comes to paſſe amongſt warriours, if the one die in the field and fight, the other getteth the vpper hand. Here is the difference, the faithfull at the laſt, euer get a finall conqueſt, & then aſcend to heauen as triumphers, & there the Diuell can aſſaile them no further; he may compaſſe the earth,Iob 1. but he cannot enter within the liſts of heauen; he neuer came thither to aſſaile any ſince he was firſt caſt out: Death therefore is the day of triumph to the faithfull, ouer all their foes.
                     
                        
                        
                           section 22 The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death, to ſhew vs that till Death be commed and gone, an end of enemies will neuer come.1 Cor. 15. When we ſee ſo many fall in the field by fight, we perceiue there is no peace to be looked for with this enemie; but bleſſed be the dead which die in the Lord, they reſt from their labours: as if the Saints neuer reſted vntill reſt and bleſſednes and dying in the Lord meete together.Apoc. 14.13. Here fraile nature is the field wherein we muſt be euer toyling, and Death as it entred by Sinne, ſo is it the end of Sinne: for for feare leſt if life had beene prolonged, ſinne might haue more increaſed: the Lord ſuffered Death to enter into the world, that Sinne might ceaſe; and to preuent that nature might not end in Death, God hath ſet downe a day, when all ſhall riſe againe; ſo that Death in the end doth extinguiſh Sinne, endeth our warfare, and maketh our nature durable.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. The faithfull redeemed by Chriſt, are ſtill ſubiect to corporall Death, and all other croſſes of this life; yet being ſanctified vnto them, they are furtherances and helpes to a bleſſed life.
                     
                        
                           section 1
                        NEither yet are Gods elect ſo redeemed from Death, as that they ſhall not taſte thereof at all; for though Chriſt hath drunke the dregs of that cup; yet euery one muſt haue his draught. It was enacted of old (as we heard) that all men muſt die,Heb. 9.27. that all muſt goe to deaths priſon, without bale or maine-priſe. No remedy can begot, no diſpenſation purchaſed: Death muſt giue vs all our laſt purgation; But his ſtrength and ſting is gone, there is our comfort: Death now is but a Phyſition to cure our maladies, and all Deaths factours (as croſſes and afflictions) ſhall but further and fit vs to a better life.
                     
                        And why ſhould this poynt ſeeme ſo ſtrange, and ſo 
                           section 2 mightily moue and amaze ſo many millions of men as it doth, that mortalitie and death, croſſes and all calamities in this world, are common to good men, as well as to bad; to the deareſt Saints of God, as to the vileſt ſinners? for beſides the common guilt of ſinne (which is cauſe ſufficient) what thing in this world, haue they not common with other men, with whom they haue a communitie of fleſh and blood? Barrenneſſe and penurie, dearth and famine, drougth and deluge, warres and hoſtilitie, ſhipwracke and ſinking, dolours and diſeaſes, with all other miſeries and maladies in this world doe betide them? yea, many times here, they ſhall weepe, when the wicked laugh, till hereafter that their ſorrowes be turned into ioy, and their teares wiped away.Ioh. 16.20. Apoc. 13.10. Herein is the patience of the Saints, the tryall of their faith, and exerciſe of their hope ſeene and approued of God.
                     Chriſt indeede hath altered the nature of the firſt Death 
                           section 3 to the faithfull, but not taken it quite away: firſt it was ordeined as a puniſhment for ſinne; now it is made a paſſage into heauen; then it was inflicted as a curſe, now Chriſt hath turned it to a bleſſing. It did at the firſt depriue men of good, but now it putteth them in poſſeſſion of eternall happineſſe. Iacob (not long before his death) pronounced this as a curſe from the Lord,Exod. 32.28. vpon the tribes of Simeon and Leui, for their crueltie againſt the Shichemites, that they ſhould be diuided in Iacob,
                        Deut. 33.8.9.10. &c. Ioſuah 21.41. Numb. 18.21.24. and ſcattered in Iſrael: yet when the children of Leui ſhewed their zeale and obedience, in killing the Idolaters, at (Moſes commandement, the Lord turned this curſe into a bleſſing. This ſcattering was a furtherance vnto them, to make them more fit to teach the people in euery citie, and ſo to receiue the Tithes of euery Tribe.Ioh. 1.5. 2 Cor. 4.6. Gen. 1.3. So at the firſt the Lord threatned death, as the puniſhment of ſinne, but (by faith in Chriſt) it is made the end of ſinne, and the beginning of glory. He that could at the firſt bring light out of darknes, could after bring a bleſſing out of a curſe. If Phyſitians

(by their art) can extract an Antidote, or preſeruatiue againſt poyſon, out of poyſon it ſelfe; why may not God by his infinite wiſedome and power draw good out of euil, mercy out of iudgement, and a bleſſing out of a curſe? Death (ſaith a learned Father) as yet remaineth for the righteous,
                           Auguſt. de peccatorum meritis & remiſſ. lib. 2 c. 34. to exerciſe their faith withall: for if immediately vpon remiſſion of ſinne, there ſhould follow immortalitie of the body, faith ſhould be aboliſhed, which wayteth in hope, for that which is not yet enioyed: yea, the Martyrs could not teſtifie their faith and patience, their courage, conſtancie, and loue to Chriſt, in ſuffering Death for his ſake.
                     
                        
                           section 4 Nothing is more grieuous to a Chriſtian heart, then the practiſe of ſinne,Rom. 7.24. but death deſtroyeth them all. Sinne brought in Death, and Death muſt driue out Sinne. After death our Sanctification ſhall be perfect, and not as here in part. Faithfull men ſhall be like Angels in heauen, readily, willingly▪ and chearefully to doe the will of God. As hearbs and flowres breede wormes by nature, yet wormes at length doe kill both hearbs and flowres: So Sinne breedeth Death in it ſelfe, and Death at laſt ſhall proue the bane of Sinne.Iudg. 16.30. As Sampſon could not kill the Philiſtims but by his owne death, no more can Chriſtians get the conqueſt of ſinne, but by the loſſe of their liues. At the firſt (as was ſaid before) Death vvas ordayned as a puniſhment for ſinne; now God doth vſe it as a meanes to ſtop the courſe of ſinne.Gen. 2.17. It was ſaid there vnto man, If thou ſinne thou ſhalt dye the death:
                           Aug. de ciuit. dei lib. 13.4. but now it is decreed thou muſt dye, leſt thou continue in ſinne. That which then was to be feared, that men might not ſinne; muſt now of neceſſitie be ſuffered, that they may be freed from ſinne. Sinne hath taken ſuch a deepe roote in our bodies, that it cannot be deſtroyed without the deſtruction thereof. Like the Leprous houſes, ſtrongly infected, nothing would ſerue to purge them,Leuit. 14.45. but needes they muſt be pulled downe: Our corrupt fleſh and nature muſt quite be plucked vp by the rootes, leſt any ſpur or ſprig remayning, the buds of

ſinne doe ſprout afreſh from the ſame, our olde houſe muſt be plucked downe, that ſo they may be built againe, as new Temples to the Lord.
                           Epiphanius contra hereſ. lib. 2. ſect. 1. Sinne (ſaith one) neuer ceaſeth to be in our bodies, vntill we come to be bleſſed with a ſhuffle.
                     If there could any humane receipt be preſcribed to auoid all croſſes and afflictions, with death it ſelfe, it would 
                           section 5 be purchaſed of ſome at any rate: but both it is impoſſible that earth ſhould redreſſe that which is ſent from heauen; and if it could be done, yet the want of miſerie would proue miſerable vnto vs: For the minde of man being cloy
                           •
                        d with continuall proſperity, would grow a very burden vnto it ſelfe, loathing that at laſt, which intermiſſion of trouble would haue made full ſweet. Giue a free horſe the full reynes, and hee will ſoone be tyred. Summer would be no ſummer, if winter did not lead it in, and follow it out.
                     Paine, pleaſure, griefe, ſickneſſe, health, with death it 
                           section 6 ſelfe, be Gods Souldiers,Math. 8.9. which Chriſt our Captaine hath vnder his gouernment; if he bid them goe, they goe; if he bid them come againe, they come; if hee bid them doe this or that, they performe it. All euill, and conſequently death it ſelfe, are profitable and medicinable, to the children of God, whither they be ſickneſſe of body, pouerty, worldly loſſes, depriuation of friends, &c. which (if they be vndergone as the fatherly chaſtiſements of our good God, for our reformation) then are they wholeſome remedies for our ſoules, for with ſuch eaſie and ſhort receipts God doth heale the ſores of ſinne, to ſpare our ſoules in the world to come. He ſends afflictions as preuentions of ſinne, as many be let blood before they be ſicke, for feare of ſickneſſe. The ſuperfluous ſprigs of the Vine are pruned to make it more fruitfull; God doth diet his children, leſt by riches they ſhould grow proud, by ſinne become inſolent, by libertie waxe wanton, &c. All wicked inſtruments of our trials are but as Apothecaries, to make drugs to heale our infirmities; they are as Maſons

to ſmooth vs (being as rough Stones) for the building, as furbuſhers to varniſh vs from the ruſt and canker of our corruption, as Scullions in the Kitchin, to ſcoure vs, and make vs bright veſſels, for the Lords owne Table. Yea, all the croſſes of the faithfull are but as vnſauorie Phyſicke, yet wholſome for the recouery of their ſicke and ſinfull ſoules. A ſound body (ſaith one) many times carrieth within it a ſicke ſoule. Some labour of the pluriſie of pride, ſome of the dropſie of couetouſneſſe, ſome of the ſtaggers of inconſtancie, ſome of the feuer of luxurie, ſome of the lethergie of idlenes, others of the phrenſie of anger, &c. And it is a rare ſoule that hath not ſome ſickneſſe. Now croſſes and afflictions are ordained of God as his medicinable remedies. What though they be vnpleaſant? they are Phyſick; it is enough if they be wholeſome: not pleaſant taſte, but ſecret vertue and operation, commends the medicine. If they cure thee, they ſhall pleaſe in diſpleaſing, or elſe thou loueſt thy taſte aboue thy ſoule.
                     
                        
                           section 7 Surely we men are very fooles in the eſtimation of our owne good. Like children, our choiſe is led altogether by ſhew, no whit by ſubſtance. Though thou knoweſt what diſh is pleaſant to the eye, and taſte, yet thy Phyſitian knowes beſt what is wholeſome. Thou wouldeſt follow thy appetite too much, and wouldeſt dig thine owne graue (as it were) with thy teeth, but God ouer-ſees thee, and ouer-rules thee. Wouldeſt thou then willingly goe to heauen? what better guide canſt thou haue then him that dwelleth there? If he lead thee through the deepe ſloughes and mariſh grounds, brakes, brambles, or thornie thickets, know thou that hee knoweth this to be the nearer way, though more cumberſom. Can there be in him any want of wiſedome, not to foreſee the beſt? can there be any want of power, not to effect the beſt? ſince what his power can doe, and what his wiſdome ſeeth ſhould be done, his loue no doubt hath done, becauſe all are infinite? He willeth not things becauſe they are good, but they are good becauſe he willeth them; yea, if ought had beene better, this

that befalleth thee had neuer beene. God willeth that he doth, and if thy will accord not with his, whether wilt thou blame of imperfection?
                     If our affections might alwayes feed vpon Mannah, we 
                           section 8 would loath it:Numb. 11.4. if our inheritance did ſtretch it ſelfe to the plaines of Iordane, we would inlarge it; and if our preheminence might reach to heauen, yet would wee raiſe vp our hearts higher. Theſe were the itching humours of Euah, who thought not Paradiſe ſpacious enough for her habitation, nor the dainties of Eden ſweet enough for her taſte, nor the preſence of God good enough for her company. But where the ſuperſcription of holineſſe to the Lord,
                        Exod. 28.36. 1 Tim. 6.6. is ingrauen on the head, and the perſwaſion of godlineſſe to be gaine, is ingrafted in the heart, there (ſaith a learned man) the luſt of the world, and the duſt of the earth ſhall be ſhuffled together as payres and pearles of equall price, accompt, and continuance. Therefore the Lord hath here choaked our fields with thiſtles, and wrapped vp all the treaſure of the world in ruſt, that ſeeing the ground whereon we ſtand to be out of Paradiſe, and the ſtaffe whereon we leane to be but rotten wood, wee might pray to God to haue the ſword put vp that ſtoppeth vs from the tree of life;Gen. 3.24. and thoſe boughes cut off that ſhadow vs from beholding our ſinnes, borne and ſuſtayned in the body of Chriſt.
                     Therefore the waters of troubles and afflictions are but 
                           section 9 as a bath to the faithfull, to cleanſe and purge them from thoſe corruptions they gather by walking in this dirty world. The chaffe and wheate both feele the flayle, yet the chaffe is free from the Milſtone, from the Fanne, and from the furnace; of theſe onely doth the wheat taſte: and ſo happy is he that is ground and baked (as it were) in an ouen, and ſo made fit manchet for the Lords owne dyet. For though the chaffe feele not the hardneſſe of the Mill in grinding, nor the heate of the Ouen in baking; yet being good for nothing, it is caſt forth,Pſal. 1.4. ſcattered with the winde, and trodden vnder foote. Such is the ſtate of the

wicked:Mat. 13.38.40. they are ſeparate as tares from the corne, eyther to be burnt in his diſpleaſure, or blowne from his preſence. God in this life (knowing the dangerous temptations of his Children) doth ſift and boult them with afflictions (the mother of humilitie, and true nurſe of repentance) leſt in time they ſhould looſe the experience of their knowledge and faith in Chriſt, and ſo ſeeke ſome eaſier kinde of life for fleſh and bloud. Neyther can we truely repent, vntill by ſome croſſe we know this world to be a place of ſorrow: for ſo long as we make our proſperitie a bulwarke to beat downe all harmes, we are to looke for aduerſitie to beate downe the high ſayle of our proud hearts, whereby we gad after our owne luſts, and leaue the anchor of peace, which is our truſt in God.
                     
                        
                           section 10 Neyther muſt wee thinke, that we ſhall euer be ſhut vp (as it were in a mewe) to ſee and ſuſtaine no euill at all. Let vs looke to fall but on our knees, becauſe Gods hand doth hold vs. Let vs looke to be humbled, but yet in mercy, becauſe the Lord ſuſtayneth vs: for if this were not, what tryall and examination ſhould there be of our faith? If our way lay alwayes (as in a fayre medow) that wee might run along (as it were) by the water ſide, into a ſhade, and that there ſhould be nothing to croſſe our deſires, who could vaunt that hee had ſerued God with good affection? But when our way ſhall ſometime be rough and ragged; when one while wee ſhall enter into a quagmire, and another while martch on craggy rockes and ſtones of temptations, then ſhall wee haue the vſe of a well exerciſed minde, in prayer, in repentance, and in contempt of this life. Thus it is requiſite that Gods graces ſhould not be idle in his Children, but ſet on worke by afflictions, whereby they may be knowne in due time and place; as alſo be taught, that though ſometime they haue much in poſſeſſion, yet that they hold but little in affection: and when God doth moſt aduance them, to feare their wants of humilitie. For if the Lord by multiplying his mercy increaſeth our account, we are often to ſuſpect

our ſelues for the vſing of Gods bleſſings, who often giueth that in iudgement, which he might denye vs in mercy; and often waineth vs from ſome things in his loue, which hee might giue vnto vs in his anger.
                     It is beſt here to be preſſed and harrowed with the rake 
                           section 11 of Gods iudgements: and bleſſed are they that to their owne ſaluation, feele ſorrow and griefe in their body, whiles ſinne may be both puniſhed and purged. It is better for vs to runne to the Lord in this life, leſt wee tarry till the Lord haue locked vs vp with the heauy fetters of deſperation, when hee ſhall ſummon vs to the barre of his Iuſtice and Iudgement in the ſight of his Angels, and (impanelling the great Inqueſt of his Saints againſt vs) ſhall denounce our fearefull and finall ſentence of endleſſe condemnation. As Moſes Rod (ſaith one) ſtriking the hard Rocke, brought forth water:Numb. 20.11. ſo the Rod of affliction (falling vpon our ſtony hearts) by the working of Gods Spirit, mollifieth them to contrition, and oftentimes brings forth euen flouds of teares to repentance. One compareth the croſſes of Gods Children to a Fyle of Iron, that taketh away the ruſt of the ſoule: to a Purgation cleanſing the body from ill humours: to a Furnace conſuming the droſſe, and purifying the Gold, &c.
                     Though the winde blow cold, yet doth it cleanſe the 
                           section 12 good graine: though the fire burne hot, yet doth it purifie the beſt Gold. Afflictions are both ſufferings and inſtructions. Though God be a chaſtiſing Father, yet a Father; though a launching Phyſitian, yet a Phyſitian, and therefore one that loues and cures: wee neede no more but lay open our griefe, and let him alone with the ſaluing, who ſeeth chaſtiſements ſometimes as neceſſary for the ſoule, as medicines for the body. When the waters of the Floud came vpon the face of the earth, downe went ſtarely Turrets and Towers: but as the waters roſe,Gen. 7.17.18.19. ſo the Arke roſe ſtill higher and higher: In like ſort, when the waters of afflictions riſe, downe goeth the pride of life, and luſt of the eyes, with the vanities of the world, but

our ſoules (as in an Arke) by a true and a liuely Faith, aſcend higher and higher, and draw nearer and nearer towards the heauen of heauens. Neyther neede Gods children care what croſſes they ſuſtaine: For as there is none more ſhamefull then the Croſſe of Chriſt; ſo all the afflictions of Chriſtians are accounted his. If wee be poore, deſpiſed, impriſoned, or whatſoeuer is the fruit of ſinne, betide vs, God is not as man to turne away his face, but wee are the more deare in his ſight; and euery croſſe ſealeth the loue of Chriſt, who ſuffereth with vs, who likewiſe was made ſinne for vs,
                        2 Cor. 5.21. 
                        who knew no ſinne, that wee might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. Who then can be diſcouraged with the afflictions of this life, or enuy at the wicked to ſee their eaſe and peace? No, no, theſe be but broken weapons, and cannot poſſibly enter to the heart of our ſoules; onely let vs take heede of ſinne, that it raigne not ouer vs, for therein Chriſt hath taken no part, and by it onely we are ſeparated from him.
                     
                        
                           section 13 When Gods children thinke themſelues furtheſt off from the Lord, they are neareſt to him; when they thinke themſelues to be fulleſt of confuſion, then the Image of Chriſt is moſt liuelieſt within them.Eſay 54.8. The Lord may hide his face for a while, euen a moment, as hee did from Chriſt, but hee muſt needes returne vnto vs with euerlaſting compaſſions: for the Image of his Sonne is cleare within vs. A bleſſed ſorrow, and woe full of happineſſe, that faſhioneth theſe dayes of our vanitie to the likeneſſe of the age of Chriſt, that with him at laſt wee might raigne for euer. A precious countenance it is, in the ſight of God, that appeareth without beauty in the eyes of men, and an vnſpeakable treaſure of ioy and gladneſſe engrauen in theſe veſſels that are but earth and aſhes. When Chriſt is the patterne (whoſe ſimilitude wee beare) who can be diſcouraged vnder the Croſſe? Vnto this hee hath predeſtinated vs,
                        Rom. 8.29. 
                        that wee ſhould be like vnto his Sonne, in all afflictions, and ſo be honoured with him in the day of glory.
                     
                        
                        Chriſoſtome ſaith very well, that then wee haue moſt 
                           section 14 neede of Gods prouidence,
                           Chriſoſt. in Pſal. 9. when we are deliuered from aduerſities; and then wee haue moſt cauſe of feare, when wee are freed from dangers. For like as wee doe much more feare the Lyon or Leopard, when they are let looſe, then when they are chained vp: ſo our vntamed affections (when by proſperitie they are vnbrideled) are much more to be feared, then when by troubles they are curbed and reſtrayned. Hee that will be able to beare the croſſe of all croſſes; namely, Death it ſelfe, muſt firſt of all learne to vndergoe ſmaller croſſes, as ſickneſſe in body, troubles of minde, loſſe of goods, friends, and good name; which may fitly be called little deaths, and the beginnings of Death it ſelfe. For the afflictions and calamities of this life, are as it were the harbingers and purueyers of Death: Firſt therefore wee muſt learne to entertayne theſe meſſengers, that when Death (the Lord and Maſter himſelfe commeth) we may in better manner welcome him.
                     Whom God moſt loues, thoſe hee moſt proues by afflictions. Why is it that in a Campe, the moſt perillous 
                           section 15 actions and attempts are committed to the moſt couragious and valiant Souldiers? Why doe Captaines ſend out the moſt choyſe and reſolute men of warre to giue the enemie a canviſado, to diſcouer a way to winne a paſſage, or to driue them away that guard the ſame? There is none will ſay my Captaine hath done me wrong, but rather hee holds mee in great eſteeme: So Gods children reioyce in their tryals, whereas cowards and effeminate men lament and weepe. God deales with his elect, as Maſters doe with their Schollers, who ſet them the greateſt taſke, of whom moſt hope is conceiued. To be in daily dangers, maketh vs lightly to eſteeme the ſame. Thus are the bodies of the Mariners hardened vnto the Sea: thus come knobs in the poore labourers hands: ſo are the ſouldiers armes ſtrengthened for the Speares and Darts, and the members of thoſe that runne made nimble for the

race. And in very deed, that part in any man is the ſtronggeſt, that moſt is exerciſed by paines and toyle. There is none ſo firme and ſolid a tree, as that which the windes oftneſt beate vpon: for being thus beaten and ballaſted, it knitteth together and ſpreadeth the rootes more firmely in the ground. The fire tryes the gold, and miſery men of courage:
                           Seneca.
                         There is no peace without war, no reſt without toyle, no crowne without croſſes, no raigning without ſuffering, no glory without ſhame and ſhaking in this wofull world.
                     
                        
                           section 16 Many would feed vpon manchet, and alwayes tread vpon Roſes: I meane in ſeruing God they would be freed from all afflictions. They loue Canaan (with the Iſraelites) but they loath the wilderneſſe. The running waters of Shilo they would taſte, but the rough ſtreame of Iordane they cannot tallage.Marke 10.35. 
                        Iames and Iohn would haue the ſeate of honour, but they would not drinke of the bitter cup. But wee muſt know that the way to heauen is not ſtrewed with flowers, but ſet with thorns, yet is it both the ſtraight and the right path to immortall glory. The perſecutions and troubles of Gods Children ſhall neuer ceaſe, till the World be without hatred, the Diuell without enuy, and our Nature without corruption. Euen the ſweeteſt of all flowers hath his thornes, and who can determine whether the ſcent be more delectable, or the pricks more perillous? It is enough for heauen to haue abſolute pleaſures, which if they could be found here below, certainly that heauen of heauens, (which is now not enough deſired) would then by ſuch meanes be altogether feared. God here compoundeth our pleaſures to the faſhion of our ſelues, ſo as the beſt delights we haue, may ſtill ſauour of the earth: thus God doth weary vs in the world, to weane vs from it.
                     
                        
                           section 17 And for Death it ſelfe (which by nature wee ſo much abhorre,) God hath mitigated and broken the ſorrowes thereof, that though they tyre the fleſh, and amaze it for a ſeaſon, yet they cannot extinguiſh the hope of a Chriſtian.

for what can Sinne (the ſting of Death) preuaile againſt vs, being pardoned in Chriſt? The abundance thereof cauſeth abundance of grace,Rom. 5.15.21. and the greater remiſſion of ſinne procureth the greater loue of God. What therefore can Sathan gaine by his aſſaults, but to multiply the reward, and make the Crowne of Gods Saints farre more glorious by their ſufferings? Death may put out our carnall eyes, yet Sathan hath not whereof to reioyce, ſo long as Faith inlighteneth the minde, neuer remouing her eyes from Chriſt Ieſus crucified: So forcible and effectuall is the ſpirituall contemplation and inſight of Chriſt crucified, that it turneth deſpayre into hope, and hope into ioy moſt glorious and vnſpeakable.
                     The humbing Bee hauing loſt her ſting in another,
                           section 18 doth ſtill notwithſtanding make a grieuous noyſe, by her often buzzing about our eares, yet wee know ſhe cannot hurt vs: So Sinne and Death hauing loſt their ſting in Chriſt, doe not as yet leaue their murmuring, but with furious ſtormes of temptations ſeeke ſtill to terrifie our ſoules, though not able to wound vs to euerlaſting death. Indeede Death may fray vs at the firſt ſight,Exod. 4.3. as Moſes rod turned into a Serpent, made him flye from it for the preſent: but through confidence in God (who hath willed vs not to feare) wee ſhall finde it a bleſſed meanes to diuide the waters of many tribulations, to make vs a paſſage from the Wilderneſſe of this world,Exod. 14.16. vnto the heauenly Land of eternall reſt. Neyther can Death ſeparate vs from God, though it be fearefull to the fleſh, to ſee his prefixed end: nay, nothing hath greater power to ioyne vs to God, through the death of him that conquered Death. And muſt it not needes be ioyfull to a Chriſtian, to be freed from this wicked life, wherein euery day is the meſſenger of freſh ſorrowes, and wherein hee findeth his corruption ſo burdenſome? and therefore he is ready moſt chearefully to imbrace it, as the Souldier that commeth (after his valour ſhewed in the field) to be made a Knight, or the King that goeth to his Coronation: for then they

ſhall not haue Reeds but Palmes in their hands, (to ſhew their triumph) and not to be crowned with thornes (as Chriſt in this world with his members are in mocking) but with immortall glory with God and his Angels, in the higheſt heauens.
                     
                        
                           section 19 To conclude, Death is the key of the King of heauen, which in mercy he ſendeth to deliuer thoſe that loue him, from the irkeſome priſon of this body of ſinne. It is the gate through which Gods friends eſcape from whole troupes and ſwarmes of euils. This whole wretched life (rightly conſidered) is nothing elſe but a continuall croſſe and death of the olde man, that being once mortified in all our members, hee may moſt gloriouſly be transformed into the Image of God. For like as there can be no generation without corruption; for ſo much as that thing which is, muſt periſh, that that thing may be made which is not: ſo this ſpirituall regeneration and transformation of man into God cannot be effected, vnleſſe the old man be firſt deſtroyed by death.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VI. Gods Children in this world (as ſtrangers and Pilgrims) haue hard entertainment, their true heauen and happineſſe commeth hereafter.
                     
                        
                           section 1
                        BVt for as much as the faithfull (while they liue in this world) are as poore ſtrangers in their voyage, and paſſengers by the way in their iourney; they muſt fit themſelues for all aſſayes, regarding neyther the winde nor the weather, foule nor faire. Such as they finde, they muſt take in good part. There is ſmall prouiſion for ſtrangers vnlooked for: as they come they muſt be accounted of. Happy ſometime they thinke themſelues if they may haue any lodging in their Inne, if it be but bare houſe-roome it muſt ſerue their

turne for the tlme. The beſt lodgings are here taken vp for great States;Luk. 2.7. Chriſt and his Mother muſt be glad of a Stable. The dainties and delicates are prouided for the Nobles and great men; the bread of aduerſitie, and water of affliction are commonly the diet of Gods deareſt children;Eſa. 30.20. vntill the time of their refreſhing come in a better life.Acts 3.19. Here for a little they ſhall weepe and mourne, till hereafter God ſend them ſuch exceeding ioy that none can take away.Ioh. 16.20.
                     
                     And when Gods children are well vſed in their hoſteries,
                           section 2 yet no allurements can make them ſtay long, but that (after their baite) they haſte on their iourney: Neither will they much be diſcouraged, with their lets and impediments, but ſtill comfort themſelues, hoping this day that to morrow will be better; howſoeuer they ſtill lagge on,1. Cor. 7.29. that they were at home. And becauſe the time is but ſhort, they weepe as they wept not, and ſo likewiſe they ſquare out their mirth, that nothing may long ſtay them in their trauell, or much either allure or diſturbe them. As Trauellers therefore that haue a long iourney to goe, prepare for the ſpeedy and happy expedition thereof: ſo muſt Chriſtians (ſaith one) make ready the chariots of good conſciences, the horſes of feruent prayer, the oyle of holineſſe for their Lampes, the ſword of the ſpirit (which is the word of God) and the ſhield of faith, that ſo they may reſiſt and ouercome all their enemies,Eph. 6.26.27. and conſtantly proceede to their iournyes end.
                     Inquire and you ſhall ſcarſe finde out one faithfull man 
                           section 3 to haue had ſound ioy or contentment in this world. All his promiſes (ſaith a Father) are lyings,1. King. 22.6. 1. King. 21.10. Iudg. 16. like the falſe Prophets of Ahab; his oathes manifeſt periuries of Ieſabels falſe witneſſes: The loue of the world, is like Dalilahs to Sampſon; his friendſhip a Iudas kiſſe;Math. 26.48. his imbracing the deceiptfull murdering of Ioab; his wine is gall,2. Sam. 10.8. his meate venemous poyſon. He that doubteth,Apoc. 17.4. let him ſtand a farre off, and view the world (for they that approach neare can neither ſee God, nor know themſelues) and hee ſhall ſee

with Abraham a filthy ſmoake, aſcending from the world (as it were from Sodome) ready to ſtrangle him, if he flie not from it. This deceitfull world (ſaith one) is like to wretched Laban,
                        Gen. 19.28. which promiſed poore Iacob faire Rahel for his ſeauen yeeres ſeruice, and in the end deceiued him with bleare-eyed Leah.
                        Gen. 29.23. 1. Sam. 18.17. & 19. Like vnto Saul that promiſed Merab to Dauid, yet muſt he be pleaſed with Micoll, or goe without. And what falſe and faire promiſes doth it daily make of long life, health, wealth, and promotion, and yet cuts ſome off in the midſt of their daies, and bringeth others to beggerie and diſgrace? Goe ye (if it were poſſible) ouer the whole world, behold Countries, and view Prouinces, looke into Cities, and harken at the doores and windowes of priuate houſes, of Princes Pallaces, ſecret chambers &c. and you ſhall heare and ſee nothing but lamentable complaints; one for that he hath loſt; another for that he hath not wonne; a third for that he is not ſatisfied; ten thouſands for that they are deceiued of the world. Can there be a greater deceit then to promiſe renowne, and memoriall (as the world doth to her followers) and yet to forget them as ſoone as they are dead? Who doth remember now one of many thouſands that haue beene famous Captaines, Souldiers, Counſellours, Dukes, Earles, Lords, Ladies, Kings, Queenes, and mighty monarches in the world?Pſal. 9.6. Iob 13.12. hath not their memory periſhed with their ſound? and is not their remembrance as aſhes vnder foote?
                     
                        
                           section 4 The ſhewes of the world are glorious in appearance, but when they come to the proofe, they are in effect as light as feathers; when they come to waight, they are but ſmoake; when they come to opening, they are but rags. The propertie of the world is to blinde thoſe that come to her, that they cannot know their owne eſtate, euen as a Rauen that firſt picketh out the eyes of a ſheepe to daſſell her from ſeeing what way to eſcape her tyrannie. To be ſhort, it hath all the deceits, all the diſſimulations, all the flatteries, all the treaſons that poſſibly can be deuiſed. It hateth them that loue it, it deceiueth them that truſt it, it

afflicteth them that ſerue it, it forgetteth them moſt that trauell for it, & damneth them that follow it. It will requite vs as Nabal did Dauid:
                        1 Sam. 25.10. 
                        Who is the Sonne of Iſhai that I ſhould know him? &c. This whole world is nothing elſe but a maine Ocean Sea of infinite troubles, and calamities, and ſcarſely canſts thou finde any houſe (in all this land of Egypt) free from ſighing, mourning, griefe and ſorrowes.Exod. 12.30.
                     
                     Wherefore ſeeing this world is ſuch a thing as it is, ſo vaine, ſo deceitfull, ſo troubleſome, and ſo dangerous; ſeeing 
                           section 5 it is a profeſſed enemie to Chriſt and Chriſtians, and therefore excommunicate and damned to the pit of Hell; ſince it is an Arke of trauell, a Schoole of vanities, a ſeate of deceit, a laberinth of horrour: ſince it is nothing elſe but a barren wilderneſſe, a ſtonie field, a dyrtie ſwines-ſty, a tempeſtuous Sea, a groue of thornes, a medow full of Scorpions, a flouriſhing garden without fruit, a dungeon of Serpents, and poyſonable Baſiliskes: Seeing it is a foundation of miſeries, a vaile of teares, a fained fable, a delectable fancie:
                           Auguſt. Epiſt. 39 Seeing (as S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh) the ioy of this world hath nothing elſe but falſe delights, true aſperitie, certaine ſorrow, vncertaine pleaſure, trauelſome labour, fearefull reſt, grieuous miſerie, vaine hope of felicitie. Since it hath nothing in it (ſaith Chriſoſtome) but teares,
                           Chriſoſt. hom. ad Pop. Antioc.
                         ſhame, repentance, reproach, ſadneſſe, negligence, labours, terrours, ſickneſſe, ſin and death it ſelfe. Since the worlds repoſe is full of anguiſh; his ſecuritie without foundation, his feares without cauſe, his trauels without fruit, his ſorrowes without profit, his deſires without ſucceſſe, his hope without reward, his mirth without continuāce, his miſeries without remedies: Seeing theſe & a thouſād thouſand euils more are in it, & no one good thing can be had from it, who would be deceiued with this vizard, or allured with this vanitie hereafter? who would be ſtaied from the noble ſeruice of God, by the loue of ſo fond a trifle as this world is?
                     If the world were our proper Element (as the water for 
                           section 6 Fiſh) we had more reaſon to be ſo worldly minded; but ſeeing Chriſt hath ſaid, ye are not of the world;Ioh. 17.14. for the loue of Chriſt we muſt forſake the world,Math. 9.9. as Mathew his gainefull

receipt of cuſtome, when he was called away. It is commodious to the life of the Fiſh to liue wholly in the water, but it is hurtfull to the ſoule of man to be giuen wholly to the world. For to get worldly gaine, the body would faine liue: but the deſire of heauenly glory muſt make it glad to die. Worldly cares make a man very vnreſty with himſelfe, but the comforts of Gods ſpirit are a Superſede as to them all,Acts 2.2. and giue him his abſolute quietus eſt. So that as the holy Ghoſt filleth the houſe; ſo grace, peace and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, fulfilleth the heart. And as he that walketh in the warme Sun, neuer deſireth the light of the Moone: ſo he that walketh in the way to heauen, will neuer ſo much reſpect his affaires vpon earth. The world rather feedeth then ſlacketh our appetites, as Oyle doth the fire. Man laboureth to labour,
                           Herodot. lib. 4. Phil.
                         and careth to take care, plowing vpon the rockes, and rowling euery ſtone for his gaine, and is neuer at reſt; likened (by one) to a people in Africa, that are at warres with the winde.
                     
                        
                           section 7 But all creatures haue their reſt from God. He is God of all (ſaith Bernard) not that all things are of his nature.

A Stone caſt out of a ſling neuer reſteth vntill it come to his centre:Rom. 11.36. ſo God (whoſe centre is euery where, and circumference nowhere) is our onely reſt, and without him (who is onely infinite) our deſires are neuer repleniſhed, which are infinite and endleſſe. We muſt therefore paſſe through this world (as the Iſraelites paſſed through Edome) who onely deſired to goe through,Num. 20.17. and to make no ſtay at all: what ſhould we ſet our delights in this Edome of the world? our paſſage through it is all we ſhould require; we ſpend our goulden daies of proſperitie (as ill husbands waſte their ſubſtance) we know not how, and are in a manner ſo careleſſe, as if God were bound to bring vs to 
                           section 8 heauen whether we will or no.
                     God hath ſet the earth vnder our feete that it ſhould not be too much eſteemed. The world it ſelfe is of a round figure (ſaith one) but the heart of man is triangular, and ſo

comprehends more then the world. Our bodies walke on earth, but our ſoules ſhould be in heauen, by heauenly deſires; and we ſhould frame our affections in forme of a Ship (that is, cloſed downeward, and open vpward) in a hearty deſire of happy ſtate. Let my minde (ſaith Auguſtine) muſe of it, let my tongue talke of it, let my heart loue it, and my whole ſoule neuer ceaſe to hunger and thirſt after it.
                     Gods children in this world (with their tryals and troubles) are tilled and manured as the ground, to be made 
                           section 9 fruitfull and fertill,Mat. 27.32. and are here proued (with Symon of Syrene,) euery one with his croſſe, and muſt thus be contented to accompanie Chriſt to his Kingdome. Manifold troubles are incident to all who are departing from the myre & durt of Egypt, to doe ſacrifice to God,Exod. 8.25. who yet will bring them into a good land, that floweth with milke and hony. Here we are a flying before many Ieſabels,
                        Pſal. 137.4. here we ſit in darkeneſſe, and ſee not the true light which ſhineth in glory.Luk. 15.13.14.23.25. Here wee are poore captaines (as in Babilon) how ſhould we ſing and reioyce in this vale of teares, in ſo low and marſhie a ſoyle, naturally ſo ſubiect vnto moyſture? This farre Country is full of penurie and ſorrow, no plenty, no muſicke vntill wee returne vnto our fathers houſe;
                           Auguſt. de verbis dom. ſerm. 70. while wee are on this ſide Iordane wee are amidſt many troubles and tryals, we muſt looke for no other, vntill we come into the heauenly land of reſt;Gen. 8.9. and what is it to liue long, but to be troubled long? Noahs Doue, at her firſt flight from the Arke, fetched many retyres, but could finde no reſting place, till Noah opened the window to take her in againe: So may our poore ſoules ſoare a time (by lifting vp many a ſigh and ſupplication to God) who at laſt will open the window of his heauenly Arke,Pſal. 126.5. and then (and not before) they ſhall finde ſafe footing after theſe worldly flouds, for ſure repoſe and reſt. Here we doe but ſowe with teares,2 Cor. 5.1. there we ſhall reape in ioy. Here our earthly houſes are like the Tabernacles that were moueable,Pſal. 84.5. there they ſhall be like the glorious

Temple ſure fixed.Pſal. 84.5. 
                        Bleſſed are they indeed that dwell in thy houſe, O Lord of Hoſts.
                     
                     Thoſe that at mid-day deſire to ſee the ſuperiour planets 
                           section 10 and lights, muſt goe downe into a wonderous deepe pit, from the light of the horizon wherein they liue, This is an Aſtronomicall experiment:) ſo to behold the light inacceſſible and ioyes of heauen, wee muſt be farre remoued from the loue and delights of this inferiour world; whilſt we ſet our affections on earthly things, wee ſeeke for no better (for wee looke for no higher.) So long as Zacheus abode in the preaſſe among the other people,Luk.19.3.4. hee was vpon to low a ground to looke on Chriſt, till hee climbed higher. Seafaring men, that haue long beene weather beaten (in the ſurging Seas) are wont to ſhowt for ioy when they diſcerne the ſhoare: So ſhould Chriſtians reioyce (after ſo manifold ſtormes of this raging world) to draw ſo neere by death, and by faith, to ſee a farre off their heauenly harbour, and place of endleſſe reſt. Worldlings are like the Reubenites, content to ſtay on this ſide Iorden,Numb. 32.4.5. becauſe it was a place fit for their Droues and cattell, and nothing regarded the promiſed land: ſo many deſire to ſtay here and goe no further, eſteeming the profits and pleaſures of this temporall life, more then of the incomprehenſible ioyes of life eternall. They are ſo ſatisfied with earthly things, that they ſauour not heauenly, &c. men led captiue into a forraine Country from their infancie, doe not onely forget their naturall language, but euen the deſire of returning home: but to the truer Iſraelites, all is wearineſſe, vntill they come into the land of reſt.
                     
                        
                           section 11
                        Augustine writeth of certaine beaſts (that are ſo patient of thirſt) that ſeeing many puddles, and other waters, will yet neuer drinke, till they come to a fountaine that is very cleare and cleane: ſo ſhould the faithfull ſtay their deſire till they come indeed to the true waters of comfort, ſo freſh and cleare: Here we muſt but recreate our ſelues, retaining ſtill our thirſt, vntill wee come to drinke our

fill at the true fountaine of bliſſe and happineſſe. The worlds manner (ſaith one) is the Iewes manner, who were wont to bring the beſt wine firſt;Ioh. 2.10. but Chriſt obſerues his old manner, and keepes the beſt wine laſt. The Iſraelites many and often times murmured in the wilderneſſe, thinking that after their deliuerance out of Egypt, they ſhould preſently haue all ſweetneſſe and abundance:Gen. 42.25 But they were deceiued, God kept that vntill they came into the land of promiſe: wee muſt not looke for our happineſſe here, God reſerueth that till hereafter. Here euery day we muſt be gathering Mannah, but when the high Sabaoth commeth, then wee ſhall ceaſe. Ioſeph gaue his brethren prouiſion for the way,Mat. 6.32. Pſal. 92.5. but the full ſackes were kept in ſtore vntill they came home to their fathers houſe. God giues vs here a taſte and aſſay of his goodneſſe, but the maine ſea of his bountie and ſtore, is horded vp in the kingdome of heauen. In this life Adam ſhall eate his bread in the ſweate of his browes, in labour and ſorrow ſhall he eate thereof, vntill he returne vnto the earth, out of which he came: as if the daies of man (by reaſon of ſinne) were nothing elſe but the daies of ſorrow, becauſe euery day hath her griefe, and euery night his terrour. The Chriſtian ſoule ſhall neuer ſing her ſweeteſt ſong, vntill ſhe come to beare her part with the Saints in the ioyfull quire of heauen. Wherefore if our inheritance be that wee ſhall raigne as kings, why put we our ſelues in ſuch ſlauerie of creatures? If our birth allow vs to feede of bread in our fathers houſe?Luk. 15.16. why delight we to eate huskes prouided for the ſwine? If a golden prize be propounded to ſuch as winne the race, and winne the goale; why ſtep wee aſide to follow flies and feathers in the ayre?
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. VII. The faithfull in this life are ſubiect to manifold infirmities, their bodies and ſoules are vnder the thraldome of Sinne, and corruption, but Death breakes their bonds, and ſetteth them at libertie.
                     
                        
                           section 1
                        MOſt lamentable and fearefull is Saint Pauls complaint (in the perſon of the faithfull) that he is carnall and ſould vnder ſinne, doing thoſe things which he hateth,Rom. 7.14.15.18.24. and omitting the good things he willeth: that in his fleſh dwelleth no good thing, and therefore crieth out (as a miſerable caitiue) to be deliuered from the body of this death. For as man at the firſt by ſin rebelled againſt his maker: ſo all things (while he liueth) ſhall rebell againſt him; euen man againſt himſelfe, the fleſh againſt the ſpirit: yea, both of them doe what wee can are lyable to the tyrannie of ſin, which (as a ſoule and an vncleane ſpirit hauing entred) will not againe (without much renting and torment be driuen out a doores? And were it not that our ſtrong man armed (far greater then ſinne) had diſpoſſeſſed him with violence;Luk. 11.22. deſperate and forlorne had beene our eſtate: yet here in this life the battell is but begun, and muſt continue all our tearme (as we haue heard,) onely death muſt end the wars, and make our conqueſt pleaſant. God here will haue vs humbled all our daies, before he will fully exalt vs, when all times and daies ſhall ceaſe.Apoc. 10.6.
                     
                     
                        
                           section 2 The corruptions of this life, and manifold infirmities of our nature, ſhall be as gyues about our legs, and fetters about our feete, to ſhew our guilty condition, and what we are. He therefore that deſireth ſo greatly to liue, is like a fooliſh priſoner, delighting in his bolts, that may be free from his fetters; and careth not, that may goe out of the Iayle and will not.Rom. 8.22. Shall the bruite beaſts and ſenceles

creatures (being ſubiect to vanitie) grone in their kinde for the redemption of Gods Sonnes, when they ſhall be freed from the bondage of ſinne; and ſhall wee that are Chriſtians, endued with reaſon, yea, and aboue reaſon, inlightened with Gods holy Spirit, (eſpecially when it ſtandeth vpon our ioyfull being, and euerlaſting dwelling with God in heauen) ſhall wee not (I ſay) lift vp our mindes, beyond this rottenneſſe of earth? Surely the very creatures ſhall condemne our backwardneſſe herein, that we are worſe then beaſts bereaued of ſenſe and reaſon.
                     Wee may ſay of our vnruly fleſh (as one ſaid once of a troubleſome neighbour) Neyther can I liue with thee,
                              section 3 neyther yet can I be without thee. Here our nature (like Hagar the bond-woman) is very diſdainfull toward Sarah the free-woman,Gen. 16.4.5. 
                        Gal. 4.29. where the rebellious appetites ſtriue againſt the regiment of Reaſon; where our wit (like another Heuah) ſtill prouoketh vs to reach of the forbidden fruit; where Sinne, like Tarquinius the proud, would tyrannize, & challenge ſo a perpetuall Dictatorſhip. We muſt not therefore commit the guard of our ſelues to this body of ſinne, nor mingle our ſoules with the corruption therof. Ioyne with thy friends, not with thine enemies: the fleſh is thine enemy, becauſe it contradicteth the vnderſtanding, and contends after nothing but to ſow enimities and troubles. Mingle not thy ſoule therewith, for feare thou confound and defile it together: for making this commixtion, thy fleſh (which ſhould be a ſubiect) comes to contemne the ſoule, which ought to command as a Soueraigne, ſeeing ſhee giues life to the body, and the fleſh (on the contrary) effects the death of the ſoule. Though the ſoule be infuſed into the body, yet wee may not thinke that ſhee is confounded with the body. Conſider the light, for an example, though it peirce into euery place, yet is it not mixed therewith: wee muſt not therefore confound the office and effects of ſo different ſubſtances, but let it reſide in the body to quicken, lighten, and gouerne the ſame.
                     
                        
                        
                           section 4 Wee ſee by experience when wee muſe and meditate on a matter, wee would not willingly ſee any body: wee like not to heare any noyſe about our eares; hauing ſometime our minde ſo fixed on our thoughts, that wee ſee not that which is before our eyes. And in the night our cogitations are more firme, and wee conceiue the better of that in our hearts, which ſerues for our learning and inſtruction. Oftentimes many men cloſe their eyes (when they would profoundly conſider of any affayres) auoyding at ſuch times the impediments of ſight, otherwhiles ſeeking out ſome ſolitary places, to the end no company may hinder their contemplations. For this body of ours procureth diuers imployments which dulleth the ſoules poynt, and ſlackens our intentions. Well therefore ſaid Iob;
                        Iob 10.9. 
                        Thou haſt made me of the clay and ſlime. Our ſoules are (as it were) plaſtered with the fleſh, but they diſſolue not into it:Verſe 11. 
                        Thou haſt apparelled mee with skinne (ſaith hee) and fleſh, thou haſt enterlaced mee with bones and ſinewes: ſo that our ſoule is confined and extended through the ſinewes, that many times ſhee is made ſtiffe (as it were) thereby, and ſometimes crooked by the heauy affections thereof.
                     
                        
                           section 5 Wee muſt therefore rouze vp our ſoules aboue the bed of our fleſh, and riſe out of this rotten ſepulchre of the body of ſinne, that wee may the more nimbly mount aloft towards heauen, and ſo retyre from this dangerous coniunction of the body. Let vs chearefully martch forwards towards our happy home: for what other thing is Death to the faithfull, but the funerall of their vices, and the reſurrection of their vertues? Let vs therefore ſwiftly aſcend (with the flight of loue) to that high and happy hill, where wee hope to reſt. Let our ſoules ſoare aloft (like the Eagle) who flyes aboue the clouds, ſhee gliſters and ſhines afreſh (by the renewing of her plumes,) ſhee raiſes her flight to the skyes, where ſhe cannot be intrapped by the ſnare, like other fooliſh Fowles, which deſcending downeward, are intrapped by the Fowler. So take

wee heede leſt our ſoules (groueling on the earth) be inſnared with Sathans gyns and worldly baites.
                     Now the better to diſcerne the ſtate of our ſoules, let 
                           section 6 vs learne of the Muſitian, who (according to the ſongs that he ſingeth, or playeth, vpon the Lute, Harpe or Recorder) hath his countenance and paſſions accordingly framed and affected: So the ſoule which vſeth the body, and playeth vpon it (as an Inſtrument of Muſicke) if ſhe be ſage, wiſe, and godly, will expreſſe (as it were with her fingers ends) the moſt inward parts and paſſions; ſo that a pleaſant harmony of good manners will redound thereof, and we ſhal ſee her obſerue ſuch melody in her thoughts and affayres, as that her deliberations and executions, will moſt ſweetly accord. It is the ſoule therefore that needeth the body, but as an inſtrument; and therefore ſoueraignetie is one thing, and ſeruice another: and there is great difference betweene that which wee are, and that which wee ought to be.
                     As the Bee doth fall among the weedes (which ſeeme 
                           section 7 ſweet flowers) and lights on this, and ſits on that, and taſting all, is pleaſed with none, but flyes away: ſo here the faithfull ſoule findes no delight in theſe flowers of ſinfull fleſh and worldly weedes, but like Noahs naked doue,Gen. 8.9. returnes againe whence ſhe was ſent, and ſoares to heauen. No more then ſhall Gods Children paine themſelues in heaping together theſe exhalations of the earth; for the heauens ſhall be ours, and this maſſe of earth (which euer draweth vs to the earth) ſhall be buryed in the earth. No more then ſhall wee weary our ſelues with mounting from degree to degree, and from honour to honour; for wee ſhall highly be raiſed aboue all heights of the world, and from on high, laugh at the folly of all thoſe wee admired, who fight here fooliſhly for leſſe then a poynt or an apple, like little children. No more then ſhall we haue ſuch combats in our ſelues; for our fleſh ſhall be dead, and our ſpirit in full life; our paſſions buryed, and our Reaſon freed in perfection. Our ſoule deliuered out of this foule

and filthy priſon, ſhall againe draw her owne breath, recognize her ancient dwelling, and againe remember her former glory.
                     
                        
                           section 8 This fleſh which wee feele, this body which we touch, is not properly man: Man is from heauen, heauen is his Countrey, and his Ayre. That hee is in his body, is but by way of exile and confinement. Man (indeede) is ſoule and ſpirit,
                           Philip Mornay de morte.
                         man is rather of celeſtiall and diuine qualitie, wherein is nothing groſſe or materiall. This body (ſuch as it is) is but the barke and ſhell of the ſoule, which muſt needes be broken, if wee will be hatched for a heauenly life, if wee will truely liue and ſee the light. Wee looke but through falſe ſpectacles; wee haue eyes, but ouer-growne with pearles; wee thinke wee ſee, but it is in a dreame, wherein wee ſee nothing but deceit. All that wee haue, and all that we know is but abuſe and villany: Death onely can reſtore vs both life and light. And yet ſo blockiſh are wee, that wee thinke ſhee comes to rob vs of them. Though our ſoule (now for a while) be bound to our bodies (as Iſaack was tyed to the Altar) yet ſo ſoone as the bonds are looſed,Gen. 22.9. it mounteth vp to heauen, a place of ioy and bliſſe. Death depriues the ſoule of no good, but (freeing it from the burden of the fleſh) makes it fitter for goodneſſe.
                           Ambr. de bono mort.
                         It is the very graue of ſinne to the faithfull, and the inſtrument and meanes to raiſe them vp to the life of righteouſneſſe: through it the ſinfull bodies are reſolued to duſt, that ſo defiled the ſoule, and ſo the ſoule (once ſeparated) aſpireth to the heauenly Spheares.
                     
                        
                           section 9 The nature of the earth (ſaith one) is cold and drye: ſo are our earthly affections to deuotion and pietie. The earth ſtands ſtill without motion, and hath the circumference carryed round about it: ſo Gods benefits compaſſe earthly men, and yet they are nothing moued. The earth doth often extinguiſh hot and fiery exhalations, which otherwiſe would aſcend: ſo doe earthly affections, many holy and heauenly motions of remembring our latter end:

But the qualitie of the earth (which wee ſhould imitate for our good) is to be fruitfull after tilling, becauſe that the ground which bringeth forth bryars and thornes is ſubiect to a curſe.Heb. 6.7.8.
                     
                     The deareſt children of God (here in the fleſh) are as 
                           section 10 poyſoned veſſels waſhed by the holy Ghoſt, wherein notwithſtanding there reſts ſome taſte and tallage of the former corruptions: But the reprobate and wicked, are as barrels full of poyſon (infuſed of the Diuell) wherein the ſpirit of God neuer ſhewed his power. Sinne (in the regenerate) hath a deadly wound, and is like the Sun faintly appearing through a thicke cloud: but in the wicked it hath a full and violent courſe.2 Cor. 1.22. & 55. Epheſ. 1.13.14. Rom. 8.15. Gal. 46.7. Gen. 32.25. Yet if wee haue receiued but the earneſt-penny of Gods Spirit in this life, wee ſhall be ſure to receiue our full wages and pay in the life to come. Neyther neede wee be diſmaid that we limpe with Iacob, and be imperfect in this life: for if wee had no infirmities, wee ſhould be as proud as the Diuell, whereas now they ſerue to humble vs, and make vs thankfull vnto God, ſo mercifully reſtrayning them, and ſo fatherly paſſing by them, and ſo they ſerue to multiply our grones vnto God, the ſooner to be freed from this body and bondage of ſinne. God doth here buffet his children with their imperfections (as he did Paul) leſt they ſhould grow inſolent.2 Cor. 12.7. Now the Lord will truſt vs no more with perfection, ſince Adam loſt it in Paradiſe, but will exerciſe vs with our weakneſſes, leſt wee ſhould ſtep into our old mothers conceipt, to thinke our ſelues Gods. And thus the Lord cureth our groſſe ſinnes by our infirmities, euen as the beſt Triacle is made of poyſon, and the skinne of a Viper is the beſt cure againſt the ſting of a Viper. And though our infirmities be ſimply euill, yet qualified and tempered (with God our Phyſitians hand,) they are turned to our good.
                     
                        If God be on our ſide, who can be againſt vs? Nay, rather 
                           section 11 (ſaith Chriſoſtome) who is not againſt vs?Rom. 8.31. But howſoeuer they are againſt vs, they ſhall not long trouble vs:
                           Chriſoſt.
                         for

God is a recorder of our patience, and Death the finiſher of our paine. And though the heauy burden of our ſinfull fleſh doe load vs, yet lightſomneſſe it is to a Chriſtian to thinke that the way is not long. The traueller thinking of his Inne (but eſpecially of his home) which is the end of his trauell, goeth more chearfully on to the end of his iourney. The bond-man calling to minde the yeares of Iubilee,
                        Leuit. 25.10. endureth with more patience the yeares of his bondage. Great are our troubles and trauels in this life, but ſaluation will one day make amends for all; when wee ſhall once be landed on the ſhoare of perfect ſecuritie, and be deliuered from all toyleſome labours, &c. Happy, yea, thrice happy and bleſſed ſhall the faithfull be, being departed from a ſhadow of life, to true life it ſelfe; from darkneſſe to light, from trouble to reſt, from ſinfull men to the moſt holy God; when the battell of their warfare ſhall be ended, and they quite freed from al the throes of Sinne and Death.
                     
                        
                           section 12 One faith well, that the word of God is ſwift, and it requireth a ſpeedy follower: if ſpeede in following, much more in attayning: if ſpeede in the body (which is a burden of ſinne) much more when the ſoule hath put it off: if vnder the croſſe wee groane, and yet goe forward; with how much more ſpeede ſhall wee haſte to the Crowne, when all teares ſhall be wiped from our eyes? And if it be true of a glorified body (as Auguſtine ſpeaketh) that the body is ſtraight where the minde will; how much rather ſhall a ſanctified ſoule (diſburdened of the body) paſſe with ſpeede to him that gaue it?Eccleſ. 12.7. The ſpirituall body raiſed vp from the graue (by the ſpirit of Chriſt) ſhall againe (being vnited to the ſoule) obay it with admirable facilitie, all ſenſe of trouble being taken away, and all corruption and ſlowneſſe remoued: when all frailtie and earthly pollution is conuerted and changed into heauenly puritie and ſtedfaſtneſſe,
                           Aug. de ciuit. dei. lib. 3. cap. 20. which ſhall not neede eyther meate or drinke, but liue for euer by the quickening ſpirit of Chriſt.
                     
                        
                        Man, of woman, is borne in trauell, to liue in miſery: Man 
                           section 13 through Chriſt doth dye in ioy, to liue in felicitie.Iob 14.1. Hee is borne into the world with cryes, vttering at his entrance his miſerable eſtate: Straight (as hee departeth) with ioyfull ſongs hee prayſeth God for euer. Hee is ſcarcely in his Cradle, but deadly enemies aſſault him: yet after death no aduerſaries can annoy him. Whileſt he is here, he diſpleaſeth God: when hee is departed, he fulfilleth his will. In this life hee dyeth through ſinne: in the life to come hee liueth in righteouſneſſe. Through many tribulations on earth is hee ſtill tryed, (as gold in a furnace) but with holineſſe vnſpeakable (in that heauenly life) is he indowed for euer. Here he dyeth euery houre: there hee liueth continually. Here is ſinne, there is righteouſneſſe: here is time, there is eternitie: here is mortall hatred, there is heauenly loue: here are paines and perils, there is pleaſure and ſafety: here is miſery, there is felicity: here is corruption, there is immortalitie: here wee ſee vanitie, there ſhall wee behold the Maieſtie of God, with triumph and vnſpeakable ioy, in glory euerlaſting. Seeke we therefore the things that are aboue, where Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour ſitteth in his Maieſtie to receiue vs.
                     Gods Children (in this world) are caſt (as it were) into 
                           section 14 a ſea of melting glaſſe, to ſeethe for a time, and boyle in,Apoc. 15.2. and in great perplexitie to ſhift for themſelues: but at length God will dragge them out to the ſhoare, and giue them eaſe in that bleſſed life to come. Sinne, with all miſery, afflictions, and death it ſelfe, ſhall be ſhut vp in hell, (as in the proper place:) and the paſſing from death to life doubles the ioyes of eternall life. As thoſe that haue eſcaped many dangerous ſhipwrackes on the ſea, greatly exulte when they come to ſhoare.
                     Mans habitation here is in houſes of clay, he leades his 
                           section 15 life in vile and irkeſome ſort:2 Cor. 5.1
                              •
                           
                         here is no firmeneſſe of iudgement, nor conſtancie in actions; yea, well-nigh no faith to be found amongſt men. In the day many an afflicted ſoule deſires the night, and when it is night, they wiſh

for day. Bitter mourning they haue inſtead of meate, and ſalt bryne teares in ſtead of drinke. No eaſe from troubles, nor releaſe from afflictions is here to be found: ſo that many deſire deaths company, and cannot haue it; they ſue to her for reſt, and peace (as tyred ſea-men) for the port and hauen. This world (to all Gods Iſrael) is an Egypt of indurable ſlauery:Exod. 5.7.8. here (for a poore liuing) they make brickes and pots, without ſtraw or ſtubble; they toile and labour for Onions and Garlicke: here they lye (amongſt ruſty and filthy pots) and are made as Scullions.Pſal. 68.13. Their poore ſoules are ſold for ſhooes,Amos 8.6. and cut to pieces as fleſh to the pot,Micah 3.3. they are as bread and meate to vngodly men, and are daily ſwallowed vp: Their backes are broken with burdens,Amos 6.6. and their hands feebled with immoderate labours. None in compariſon, here, regardeth the miſery of poore Ioſeph,
                        Pſal. 105.18. though his feete be hurt the ſtockes, and the heauy gyues doe peirce his ſoule. This is the guerdon of the world, and the reward that the wicked ones repay to Gods elect,Iob 1.2. 1 Tim. 6.7. as naked they came into it, ſo naked they ſhall leaue it for all their toyle.
                     
                        
                           section 16 What comfort therefore may it be to the faithfull children of God, to be freed from this thraldome; and by Death (as Gods meſſenger) to be ſent for of the King of heauen, with him to reſt from their trauell, and to be bleſſed for euer; for their houſes of clay, and earthly tabernacles,2 Cor. 5.1. to take poſſeſſion of heauenly habitations, glorious and eternall manſions, with the liuing God himſelfe? To haue perfect libertie and freedome, for their miſerable ſlauery and bondage; all fulneſſe of ioy and comfort, in ſtead of their former ſorrowes and calamities, neuer to hunger and thirſt againe, being ſtill fully fed and fraught with the pleaſures of Gods houſe, and fully repleniſhed with the dainties and delicates prouided for the marriage of the Lambe?Apoc. 19.9. Mat. 22.2. Phil. 1.21.23. &c. Is not this a royall exchange and happy Mart? And therefore true is Pauls Poſitions, that Death is the faithfull mans aduantage, and that to be with Chriſt is beſt of all. If Peter and Iohn, hauing but

a glimpſe of Chriſts glory in the mount,Math. 17.4. could ſpeedily be reſolued that it was beſt for them to dwell there; what ſhall we then iudge of the fruition of happineſſe, and ſubſtance of glory, when the very ſhadow thereof is ſo beautifull and glorious? why therefore ſhould we feare the ſorrowes of death and graue, being fully aſſured of the comfortable preſence and protection of God himſelfe.
                     Therefore we reioyce (ſaith Paul of himſelfe and the 
                           section 17 faithfull) in all our tribulations and afflictions,Rom. 5. and why doe they reioyce? becauſe the loue of God is ſpread abroad in their hearts, through the holy Ghoſt.2 Cor. 1.5. For as the ſufferings of Chriſt doe abound: ſo doe the conſolations increaſe in Gods elect, to their exceeding ioy. Thus will the Lord, when ſickneſſe, ſorrowes, and death it ſelfe approach to his children, comfort and viſite them vpon their death beds, miniſtring moſt ſweet refreſhing to their ſoules: With his right hand will hee hold vp their heads, and with his left hand, will he imbrace them in his loue;Cant. 2.6 & 8.3 he will couer them with his wings, and they ſhall be ſafe vnder his feathers;Pſal. 9.4. his faithfulnes and truth ſhall be their ſhield and buckler: who now would not haſten to the fruition of ſuch ioy, and continuall gladneſſe of heart? And what man in miſerie deſireth not to rid himſelfe from the daily ſorrow and ſadneſſe of ſpirit:
                           Cyprian. de mortalit.
                         And ſince videre Chriſtum ſit gaudere (as Cyprian ſaith) to ſee Chriſt be the reioycing of Chriſtians, and that without the ſight of him it is impoſſible for vs ſoundly to reioyce; what blindneſſe and madneſſe is it in mortall men, ſo to loue and embrace this vale of teares, and not rather haſten to that perfect ioy, that they can neuer looſe? Wherefore hideſt thou thy face? (ſaith Auguſtine to God) happily thou wilt ſay,
                           Aug. in ſoliloq.
                         no man ſhall ſee me and liue. Oh then Lord that I were dead, ſo I might ſee thee: Oh let mee ſee thee, that I may die; euen here I will not liue; die I would, yea, I deſire to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt; I refuſe to liue,Phil. 1.23. that I may liue with Chriſt.

                           section 1
                        GOds children now being redeemed from Sinne and Death, and truely vnited to Chriſt by his ſpirit (whom they apprehend by an vnfained faith) cannot chuſe, but ſhew forth the fruits of this their high calling,Phil. 3.14. to the glory of him, that hath choſen them. And (being partakers of the diuine nature) they flye from the corruptions of the world, and giue all diligence to ioyne vertue with their faith,2 Pet. 1.4.5.6. &c. and with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience godlineſſe, and with godlineſſe brotherly kindeneſſe, and with brotherly kindeneſſe loue, and theſe things (being among them and abounding) will keepe them from being idle and vnfruitfull. The grace of God to them appeareth not in vaine, but teacheth them to denie all vngodlineſſe, and worldly luſts,Titus 2.11.12.13.14. & to liue ſoberly, righteouſly, & godly in this preſent world, &c. and being riſen with Chriſt (from the graue of corruption, they euery day more and more ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue, ſetting their affections where Chriſt ſitteth, and not on the things that are on the earth, for they are dead to the world,Col. 3.1.2.3. and their true life is hid with God in Chriſt: therefore they labour to be holy (as he that hath called them to his kingdome and glory) is holy.1 Pet. 1.15.16. They daily imploy themſelues in reading and meditating of the word of God,1 Theſ. 2.12. in prayer and religious exerciſes of holy deuotion, loathing ſtill this world, and ſinfull life, daily growing to be ſpirituall and heauenly, hauing their affections and zeale inflamed with the loue of God. They ſay (with Auguſtine) O Lord,
                           Aug. lib. medit. cap. 21. I delight to heare of thee, to talke of thee, to write of thee, to deuiſe of thee,

and in my heart to print whatſoeuer I learne of thee. So muſt wee walke in theſe holy paths with all Gods Saints.
                     Godly deuotion and holy meditations (ſaith one) are 
                           section 2 as brine and pickle, to keepe and preſerue this corruptible fleſh of ours from the euill ſcent that breedeth in our nature, by originall ſinne. They are as faggots and firebrands that enkindle and inflame the loue of God in our hearts. And as the fiſh (out of the water) die forthwith, and the drops of raine (diſtilling from the clouds vpon the ground) doe quickly dry and drench vp, and the fire without fuell is ſoone extinguiſhed: So our faith and loue, &c. (without theſe ſanctified meanes) doe ſuddenly decreaſe. They are as precious perfumes, burnt in a polluted houſe, and ſick-mans chamber. The ſweet incenſe of prayer,Pſal. 14.1.2. and the ſauory ſmell of that odorifferous balme of a liuely faith and effectuall knowledge of God, purge and clenſe the corruption of our liues and vncleane deſires. God hath choſen vs to be his glorious temple (in whom hee dwelleth by his ſpirit) therefore wee muſt haue our hearts purified by faith,1 Cor. 3.16.17 
                        Acts 15. and clenſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe and vncleaneneſſe both of bodies and ſoules, and ſo adorne the place of his preſence and habitation with all vertue and holineſſe.1 Cor. 8.17. Hee that deſtroyeth the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy: for the Temple of God is holy, which you are.
                        1 Cor. 3.17. 
                        Saint Peter willeth vs to gird vp the loynes of our mindes, teaching vs that as they which weare long garments (when they come in the foule wayes) doe take and gird them vp,1 Pet. 1.13. leſt they ſhould tag in the way: So we whoſe mindes and affections doe traile (as it were) vpon the earth (trudging through this foule, and filthy world) muſt heaue them vp towards heauen, leſt they ſhould touch the damnable filth of ſinne and wickedneſſe.
                     It is in vaine to boaſt of iuſtification, without the vnfained ſanctification of Gods ſpirit. For as there can be no fire 
                           section 3
                        
without warmth, and light: ſo neither can God by his ſpirit be in vs, of with any of vs, but he will alſo purifie vs from vice, and corruption: therefore wee muſt follow peace and holineſſe,Heb. 12.14. without the which no man can ſee the Lord. Chriſt hath crucified our old man, and put to death our vice and corruption, and ſhall wee reuiue the ſame? Shall we maintaine our Sauiours enemies, and giue life againe to theſe deadly poyſons of our ſoules? If wee will be Burgeſſes of heauen, we muſt be ſtrangers to the earth: Where is the houſe of our Father, but in heauen? and there dwelleth our eldeſt brother Ieſus Chriſt, and all our chriſtian friends and kindred; Heauen then is our true Country, and on earth we are but trauellers.
                     
                        
                           section 4 When Moſes had conuerſed with God but fortie daies vpon the Mount-Oliue,Exod. 34.29. at his comming downe, his face ſhined and gliſtered with heauenly glory: So muſt we (beholding in a mirror the glory of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in his word and Goſpell) as it were with open face, and not with a vaile (as did Moſes) be changed into the ſame image,2 Cor. 3.18. from glory to glory, as by the ſpirit of the Lord. If (I ſay) but this ſhort time, while we liue we be conuerſant in heauen (by our moſt holy faith and fruits thereof, in all holy affections, thoughts, words and meditations) we ſhall in the end become heauenly, and ſpirituall, both in word and deede. As wee ſee by experience, when a country-man, hath beene trayned vp ſometime in the Court, he forgetteth his clowniſh kinde of life, and becommeth a Courtier: Let vs therefore leaue the ſpeaches, habit, faſhions, and manners of this wicked world, wherein we liue, and inure our ſelues with the cuſtomes and courſe of the court of Heauen. Let all our thoughts, words and communication teſtifie, that (in ſpirit) wee are already there.
                     
                        
                           section 5 Chriſt Ieſus (whom all true Chriſtians haue put on by baptiſme,Rom. 13.14. as a garment) is a moſt royall robe of grace, holineſſe and ſanctification; and ſhall we be ſo ſloathfull to traile and trample him in the dyrt of filthineſſe and ſinne?Cant. 5.3.
                        
or putting him off, to put on the vile, and ſpotted garment of the fleſh, by following the luſts thereof?Iudg. 23. When winter is once ouer, the nearer that the Sunne draweth vnto vs, the more doth the earth (being warmed with the heate thereof) fructifie and increaſe; and the longer the daies are, the more worke we may doe: euen ſo the nearer the kingdome of heauen doth approach vnto vs (by the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of righteouſneſſe) or the nearer we draw to death, the more we ſhould be inflamed in the loue of God, and all good workes. As the Sunne beames doe come to the earth, and yet are in the region from whence they are ſent: ſo the mindes and ſoules of Gods children (though conuerſant in the earth) are truely ſeated and ſetled with God in heauen, from whence they came.
                     Let vaine-glorious worldlings, who (with the Camaelion)
                           section 6 liue by the ayre, and therefore are alwaies found gaping; and who haue (with the Moone) but a borrowed light in the world, and no true light of the word, and therefore ſtill continue in waxing and waining; let ſuch (I ſay) feede ſtill their fancies with ſhewes and ſhadowes (all which ſhall end in a moment;) but let vs that are Chriſtians liue the life of the righteous,Numb. 23.10: that ſo we may die a righteous death, and liue in peace and happineſſe, both here and hereafter. If we liue in the ſpirit, then let vs walke in the ſpirit.Gal. 5.25. Our walking and behauiour is a ſure and certaine ſigne whether wee be aliue or dead. If our walking and working be ſpirituall, then doe we liue in the ſpirit, but if our workes be carnall, we are dead in the ſpirit, neither haue we any thing to doe with Chriſt and his kingdome. As there is a reſurrection to the life of glory, ſo is there alſo a reſurrection to the life of grace. As the death of the ſoule went before the death of the body: ſo muſt the reſurrection of the ſoule (from the death of ſinne) be firſt, and then in due time will come the reſurrection of the body. Sinne is a kinde of death: this my ſonne was dead,
                        Luk. 15.24. 
                        and is now aliue: holy conuerſation is a riſing againe, and bleſſed

are thoſe that haue their part in this reſurrection.
                        Apoc. 20.5.6. Luk. 15.24. The prodigall Sonne by repentance found himſelfe, who firſt by riot had loſt himſelfe: and therefore let vs giue him our life, who gaue vs life.
                     
                        
                           section 7 Chriſtians muſt be as birds, who for neceſſitie ſake, are faine to ſtay vpon the earth; yet ſtill (for the moſt part) are ſoaring in the skie, where they tune many a pleaſant note; ſo ſhould our thoughts be imployed in things beneath, but our chiefe delights muſt ſtill climbe higher, where true ioyes dwell; where no diſtracting thoughts can once diſturbe them. Raiſe vp thy ſelfe O ſoule (ſaith Auguſtine) and thinke of that good which containeth all good.
                           Auguſt. de Ram. Aug. de ſpirit. et anima.
                         Our deuotion muſt not be as the Morning dewe, which vaniſheth with the Sunne; nor like the leaues of Autumne that fall from the tree, but our goodneſſe muſt abide ſo long as wee liue; yea, wee muſt rather yeelde vp our breath and being, then our faith and deuotion.
                     
                        
                           section 8 Euery one feareth the death of the body, but few are affraide of the death of the ſoule. That which poſſibly cannot be auoyded, men ſeeke to ſhun; but to auoide ſin (that they may liue for euer) few or none doe care. To labour not to die, is but trauell in vaine: this is to defer, not to auoide Death, but if we would take heede we ſinne not, then neede we not be doubtfull after death to liue for euer. Simply to liue is not ſo good, except a man liue well and in Gods feare; for the Diuels and the damned liue, but better it were if they had no being. The ſoule without grace, is as the ground without moyſture, which turneth to duſt, and vaniſheth, and like the barren earth accurſed. It is as an vnarmed man, and one that is naked amongſt the pykes and darts of his aduerſaries. And ſince the earth was curſed for our ſinnes in Adam, and our ſoules are ſaued by faith in Chriſt: let the direction of our thoughts to him be the meſſenger to our hearts, that our affections are in heauen; for we are not placed that wee ſhould be planted here, but being bought from this earth

(by bloud) we ſhould clenſe our ſelues in this world with water, that ſince ſome inferiour affections muſt needes be found here below; yet the duſt onely may cleaue to our feete, and our head and hands lift vp to God.
                     So ſhall we haue comfort in our death, being thus ſanctified 
                           section 9 in our life, and it ſhall ſerue vs as a barge to bring vs to the hauen of happy reſt, which now is made (through Ieſus Chriſt) the iſſue of all miſerie, and an entrance to true ſafetie to all Gods elect. Chriſtians therefore (one would thinke) neede not (as Pagans) conſolations againſt death,
                           Ambroſe.
                         but death ſhould ſerue them (as a conſolation) againſt all afflictions. So that wee ſhould not onely ſtrengthen our ſelues not to feare it, but accuſtome our ſelues to hope for it: for vnto vs it is not onely a departing from paine and euill, but an acceſſe and poſſeſſion-taking of all happineſſe and good; not the end of life, but the end of death, and beginning of life: becauſe it is not to vs a laſt day, but the dawning of an euerlaſting day. Death now is the way to recouer our former eſtate, being loſt by our firſt parens. It is the meanes to tranſlate vs from our mortall condition, to euerlaſting immortalitie and happineſſe in Chriſt. Who therefore will not be glad to exchange for the better? Let them deſire to liue in the world, whom it loueth and affecteth, but all true Chriſtians it hateth euermore and deſpiſeth.
                     What man being farre from home, would not haſten to 
                           section 10 returne into his country? and though he ſaile vpon the dangerous ſeas, would hee not hoyſt vp the ſailes of his Ship, and haſten his iourney with ſome hazard to come to the hauen of reſt, where he would be? Now this world is a forraine Countrie to all Chriſtians, where they wander for a while; our home is the Paradiſe of God; heauen it ſelfe is the hauen, whither Gods children muſt ſaile to land, and the way and paſſage (both by ſea and land) is death, decreed of God; which to the godly (as hath beene ſaid) is not an end of their liues, but an end of their ſinnes. It deſtroyeth not nature, but reformes it. It cutteth off our corruption, and reſtoreth vs to immortalitie. Whilſt I remaine

vpon earth, I am (as it were) in my wardſhip, but hereafter I ſhall haue the full managing of all my goods. O happy dying, and bleſſed death, which art made ſo gainefull vnto me; why ſhould I feare thee which bringeſt all ſorrowes and feares to an end? Thy name is fearefull, but thy effect full of conſolation; eſpecially when I behold thee vnder his feete,1 Cor. 15.54.55.56.57. which hath pulled out thy ſting, taken from hell his command, and ſpoyled the diuell of his power.
                     
                        
                           section 11 The iudgement of God cannot afflict me, for that the Iudge is my aduocate. Sathan my accuſer is condemned, & the Angels of the Lord are my defenders againſt him.
                           Auguſt.
                         The graue (though it gape wide) yet can it not deuoure me, for although I muſt rot in it, yet was it my Sauiours bed, who was laid therein to ſanctifie it for me, by his ſweet funerall, and to prepare me there a chamber of reſt. But O Lord ſuffer me not to die, before I begin to liue, nor to rot in the graue, before I be aſſured of my immortall inheritance in heauen? wound my hart with a holy ſorrow; waſh my ſoule with thy precious blood. Let other men deſire to liue many yeares vpon earth, my longing is to aſpire to the dayes of heauen, whereas one day conſumes not another, but are endleſſe, and eternall. The reward of life, the ioy of euerlaſting ſaluation and perpetuall bliſſe, the poſſeſſion of Paradiſe (which were loſt by ſinne) returne againe vnto vs as ſoone as we leaue this world.
                     
                        
                           section 12 Now where coeleſtiall things ſucceede terreſtriall, great, and ineſtimable things, thoſe that are ſmall and baſe, eternall,
                           Cyprian. de mortalitate.
                         and euerlaſting, ſuch as are tranſitorie and fraile, is there any occaſion ſo to waile and weepe? It belongeth to him to feare death, that would not goe to Chriſt, which beleeueth not that then hee begins to reigne in heauen, when hee leaues the earth: wherefore wee muſt iudge of death, not as it ſeemeth in it ſelfe, but as it is in Chriſt. Naturally we deſire to be, and conſequently wee ſhunne death, which depriues vs of our being heere. Death (I confeſſe) is fearefull to the deareſt children of God, for a while, becauſe it is repugnant to their nature:

yet notwithſtanding we ſee our eſtate, being holden (as priſoners) in this body of ſinne, ſo long as wee liue, and therefore we ought to long for the euerlaſting life, which is promiſed vs after death. For when wee draw nigh towards death, then come we neere to it, and death is the very gate of life; aſſuring our ſelues that ſince Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe hath paſſed that way, we neede not be diſmayed, that death ſhall conquer vs: for it is now (through him) but as a rebated ſword, and blunted knife, whoſe edges and points are bowed and broken, which albeit they draw ſome bloud, yet ſerueth it but to purge vs.
                     Neyther doth God euer ſuffer his Elect to depart this 
                           section 13 life without great comfort; vntill they haue ſeene their Sauiour (with old Simeon) eyther in ſoule or Spirit.Luke 2.28.29. The life of this perſwaſion is the death of ſinne; and ſuch hope of eternitie, is the reuenge of iniquitie. Fye vpon ſinne, whileſt I behold my Sauiour: fie vpon ſhame, whileſt I behold my glory. Heauen is my hope, the ſpirituall viſions of my heart are the impreſſions of my ioy. Therefore let vs ſhake off feare, and arme our ſelues to runne this race, not ſeeking any by-way, but keeping on the highway to heauen, whither Chriſt our captaine hath already conducted vs in his fleſh.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IX. The bleſſed and vnſpeakable happineſſe, ioy, and immortalitie of the faithfull after this life ended.
                     
                        NOw that our deſires may be further inlarged 
                           section 1 towards heauen, and our affections the better with-drawne from the loue of this deceitfull life, and world of vanities; it will not be amiſſe (at the leaſt) to meditate on thoſe compleat ioyes, which no tongue indeede is able to expreſſe, or heart of man conceiue, which Chriſt (by his bitter death and ſufferings)

hath full dearely purchaſed for vs.Rom. 8.18. Saint Paul counteth all the afflictions of this life that men can ſuffer, not to be worthy of the glory which ſhall be ſhewed, which he calleth an eternall waight of glory.
                        2 Cor. 4.17. Our afflictions here are but momentany and temporall; but the ioyes of heauen are eternall, not poſſible to be expreſſed. It is a ſhew beautifull, in ſenſe wonderfull, in waight exceſſiue, in meaſure without bounds, in dignitie without compariſon, and in continuance without end: yea, it is ſuch and ſo great, that as one torment in hell ſhall make a reprobate to forget all his worldly pleaſures; ſo the leaſt taſte of this glory, ſhall make the heyres of God to forget all their former miſeries. This glory is like God the giuer of it, that muſt be imbraced for the excellencie of it, and thirſted after for the eternitie of it.
                     The ioyes of heauen as farre exceed theſe priſon-ioyes 
                           section 2 on earth, as Mannah in the Wilderneſſe did the fleſh-pots of Egypt; and the bread that the loſt ſonne ate in his fathers houſe, the huskes he ate abroad with Swine. They are ſo great (ſaith one) that they cannot be meaſured, ſo long that they cannot be limited, ſo many that they cannot be numbred, ſo precious that they cannot be valued: yet wee ſhall ſee them without wearineſſe, loue them without meaſure, and praiſe them without end. God in creating this tranſitory world (which yet is but a poore cottage to his eternall habitation) what power, what magnificence, what maieſtie hath he ſhewed therein? what glorious heauens, and how wonderfull hath hee created? what infinite Starres, and other Lights hath he deuiſed? what Elements hath he framed? and how ſtrangely hath hee compact them together? The Seas toſſing and tumbling without reſt, ſo well repleniſhed with all ſorts of fiſh▪ the Riuers running inceſſantly through the earth (like veynes in the body) and yet neuer to be empty, or ouer-flow the ſame. The Earth it ſelfe ſo furniſhed with all varietie of creatures, as that the hundred part thereof are not imployed by man, but remaine to ſhew to man the

full hand and ſtrong arme of his Creator. And all this was done in an inſtant, with one word, and that for a ſmall time in reſpect of the eternitie to come: What then ſhall wee conceiue of the houſe of God, that glorious heauen it ſelfe? If the cottage of his meaneſt ſeruant, (and that made for a time, to beare off (as it were) a ſhowre of raine) be ſo princely, ſo glorious, ſo gorgeous, ſo full of maieſtie (as wee ſee this world is) what muſt we think that the Kings Pallace it ſelfe is? appoynted for all eternitie, for himſelfe and his friends to liue and raigne in for euer?
                     
                        O Lord (ſaith Auguſtine) if thou in this vile body of ours giueſt vs ſo great and innumerable benefits,
                        
                           Aug. in ſoliloq.
                         
                        from the firmament,
                              section 3 from the ayre, from the earth, from the ſea: by light, by darkeneſſe, by heate, by ſhadow, by dewes, by ſhowres, by windes, by raines, by birds, by fiſhes, by beaſts, by trees, by hearbs, by plants, and by ſuch varietie and miniſtery of all thy creatures: Oh (ſweet Lord) what manner of things, how great, how good, and how infinite are thoſe which thou haſt prepared in our heauenly Countrey, where we ſhall ſee thee face to face? If thou doe ſo great things for vs in our priſon, what wilt thou giue vnto vs in our Pallace? If thy enemies and thy friends be ſo well prouided for together in this life, what ſhall thy onely friends receiue in the life to come? If our Iayle containe ſo great matters, what ſhall our Countrey and Kingdome doe? O my Lord and God, thou art a great God, and as there is no end of thy greatneſſe, nor meaſure of thy wiſedome, nor number of thy mercies: ſo is there neyther end, number, nor meaſure of thy rewards towards them that loue thee. But theſe ioyes (alas) can we not comprehend whileſt we liue in loue with this world, no more then a priſoner ſhut vp in a dungeon can know what is done in a Princes pallace; or a baniſhed man in a forraine land, can learne what is done in his Country, from which he is exiled.
                     If the very remembrance of the ioyes of heauen ſo affect 
                           section 4 Gods Children, what will the fruition doe? Wee are ſomewhat moued when wee call to minde that all the

Saints in heauen doe know God, all ſee God, all loue God: then what will it be one day to be ioyned with that celeſtiall ſocietie, to know with them, to ſee with them, to loue with them? Now what a ioy is it to conſider the ioy of this moſt ioyfull day to all faithfull beleeuers in Ieſus Chriſt,Rom. 8.33.34. who ſhall be quit by proclamation? Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? How ſhall their hearts exult, when thoſe that were not worthy to be ſeruants, ſhall be made as Gods ſonnes, and coheyres with Ieſus Chriſt of euerlaſting glory?Verſe 17. True happineſſe (ſaith one) is to haue preſent all good things that the heart loueth, and to haue abſent and baniſhed whatſoeuer the ſoule loatheth; when a man both loueth that which is beſt, and enioyeth it; when a man enioyeth all that hee willeth, and willeth nothing but that which is beſt.
                     
                        
                           section 5 Hee which cleaueth to the Lord, is one ſpirit with him: for true loue is the vnion of louers.1 Cor. 6.17. Such is euery one as his loue is. So great then ſhall be our loue to God and heauen, as that wee ſhall deſire to loue nothing elſe. For with him in his Kingdome, wee ſhall haue perfect health without infirmitie; health and ſaluation ſhall be the wals of Gods elect,Eſay 60.18. they ſhall alwayes flouriſh as in youth, without any danger of withering old age; yea, they ſhall be of the meaſure of age, and fulneſſe of Chriſt; wee ſhall haue ſaturitie without loathſomneſſe.Epheſ. 4.13. Here the eye is neuer ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the eare with hearing; but then our deſire ſhall be repleniſhed with all good things: I ſhall be full with thy image (ſaith the Prophet,Pſal. 17.15.) They ſhall not hunger nor thirſt any more; yet being full, they ſhall ſtill affect; and in affecting ſhall be ſatisfied, that their fulneſſe cloy them not, and that they feele no want in their deſires.
                           Gregorie.
                         Wee ſhall haue beauty without any blemiſh or deformitie: the iuſt ſhall be as the Sunne in Gods Kingdome,Mat. 13.43. Phil. 3.21. they ſhall be like Chriſts glorious body. Our image ſhall be heauenly, as now it is earthly: We ſhall haue all abundance without any want: for God will giue his people a place where there is no penury. There ſhall be

nothing without them which they ſhall neede to deſire, nor any thing within them which they neede to abhorre. Mortalitie ſhall be abandoned, Death ſhall be deſtroyed for euer. Gods Children ſhall liue in ſafety without feare, haue perfect knowledge without ignorance: for now we doe but ſee in a glaſſe, and then ſhall wee ſhee with open face, and know as wee are knowne. Wee ſhall haue glory without reproach, ioy without ſadneſſe; for God will then wipe away all our teares, griefe and ſorrow ſhall flye away when we ſhall enter into our maſters ioy.
                     They that come to the maine Ocean Sea, finde water 
                           section 6 enough, if they come by millions to take handfuls of it: So be there a multitude, (which no tongue can number) God yet hath Crownes for their heads, and Palmes for their hands,Apoc. 7.9. when they ſhall follow the Lambe whither ſoeuer he goeth. If there were ſo great Faith in the earth, as there is moſt ſure reward in heauen, what loue ſhould wee haue to the life to come? Seeing Chriſt therefore hath prepared heauen for vs, let vs prepare our ſelues for heauen. What pleaſure then ſhall wee haue, when we ſhall be in the company of Angels? when we ſhall ſee our bleſſed Redeemer with our eyes, and the infinite brightneſſe of Gods diuine light? What a glory ſhall it be to behold that vniuerſall Goodneſſe, in whom are all good things? that greater world, in whom all worlds are contained? What a ioy ſhall it be to ſee him, who being one, is all things, and yet being one, and moſt ſimple in himſelfe, comprehendeth the perfection of all things? This is the eſſentiall glory of the Saints, this is the centre of their deſires. Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God: This is a viſion that maketh vs happy; a viſion that paſſeth the beauty of all earthly things, of Gold, Siluer, Pearles, and precious Stones; of woods, of fields, of Sea, of ayre, of Sunne, of Moone, of Starres, of Angels, and all creatures: for all theſe things haue their beauty from hence. This ſight of God is the full beatitude, and totall glory of man, to ſee him that made both heauen and earth, to ſee him

that made thee, that redeemed thee, that glorified thee. For in ſeeing him thou ſhalt poſſeſſe him, in poſſeſſing him thou ſhalt loue him, thou ſhalt praiſe him, for hee is the inheritance of his people, he is the poſſeſſion of their felicitie, and the reward of their expectation.
                     
                        
                           section 7 Mans ſoule was made according to Gods image, therefore it may be imployed with other things, but ſatisfied and filled it cannot be; for it being made capable of God, whatſoeuer is leſſe then God, cannot ſuffice it; and when it hath God, it hath her hearts deſire; neither is there any outward thing beſides, that it would wiſh. But while it deſireth any outward thing, it is a manifeſt argument that God is not within; for if God be poſſeſſed it can deſire no more: For in as much as God is the ſoueraigne good (yea all that good is) the ſoule hath nothing it may wiſh for more, but inioyeth him who is all that good is. As long as the ſoule deſireth any creature, it is alwaies hungry, for although it haue what it can deſire of creatures, yet remaineth it emptie; for there is nothing that can fill it, but him alone, after whoſe Image it was created. And thoſe O Lord (ſaith Auguſtine) thou onely fitteſt, who deſire nothing beſides thee, which iudge al earthly things as dung in regard of thee, and heauenly things.
                     
                        
                           section 8 Oh that is a happy and glorious day laſting euer, and neuer at an end, wherein I ſhall heare the voyce of ioy and thankeſgiuing, when I ſhall heare it ſaid, enter into thy Maſters ioy, which is perfect ioy without all ſorrow. There ſhall be the liuing life, the ſweet life, the louely life: There ſhall be no enemie to aſſault, no inticement of the fleſh to alure, but ſoueraigne and ſure ſecuritie and quiet ioyfulneſſe, and ioyfull and bleſſed euerlaſtingneſſe, and euerlaſting happineſſe. The happy Trinitie and vnitie of Trinitie, and deitie of vnitie, and bleſſed ſight of deitie: this is the Maſters ioy: O ioy aboue ioy, beſides which there is no ioy; when ſhall I enter into thee, that I may ſee my God, who dwelleth in thee! Bleſſed are they that haue eſcaped from ſea to ſhoare, from exile to their

Countrie; from the priſon of this wretched life, to that ſurpaſſing Pallace, enioying this wiſhed-for reſt. Their comfort is endleſſe, their mirth without mourning, health without ſickneſſe, way without weariſomneſſe, light without darkneſſe: where we ſhall be rich without couetouſneſſe, aduanced without pride, and ſhal poſſeſſe all things without deſire, and ſhall liue eternally without dying any more.
                     I can ſooner tell (ſaith one) what there is not in that 
                           section 9 bleſſed life, then what there is. There is no feare, no ſickeneſſe, no death, no heauineſſe, no infirmitie, no hunger, no thirſt, no heate, no cold, no warre, no contention, no want, no woe, no paine, no pouerty, no corruption, no temtation, &c. I haue now partly told you what there is not there, will you know what is there? I can ſay nothing but with the Apoſtle, No eye hath ſeene, no eare hath heard,
                        1 Cor. 2.9. 
                        neyther hath it entred into the heart of man, what vnſpeakable ioyes God hath prepared for them that loue him. If it be ſo, what can I doe elſe, but lift vp mine eyes to heauen, mine eares to God, and my heart to Paradiſe, to ſee and vnderſtand what I can comprehend vpon earth? and therefore my ſoule longeth after thee O God, and ſigheth till it ſee the brightneſſe of thy face. O Kingdome of euerlaſting bliſſe, where thou O Lord, the hope of all Saints art, reioycing them on euery ſide with thy bleſſed ſight▪ If the wiſe men of the Eaſt came ſo farre off, and reioyced to ſee Chriſt in the manger, what will it be (in the ſight of his Elect) to ſee him in his glory? If Iohn Baptiſt a babe,Luke 1.41. ſprang in his mothers wombe for ioy of Chriſt ſo newly conceiued, and not yet ſeene, what ſhall his reall preſence doe in his royall Kingdome, but euen rauiſh with ioy our very hearts and ſoules, when we ſhall continually enioy his moſt glorious ſight? For it paſſeth all other glory that the Saints haue in heauen, to be admitted to the ineſtimable ſight of Chriſt his face in heauen, and to receiue the beames of glory from the brightneſſe of his Maieſtie.1 Kings 10.8. If Solomons ſeruants were accounted happy (of Sheba the Southerne Queene)

for their daily liuing and reſidencie in his Court, and hearing of his exquiſite wiſedome, ſo admirable to all the world; how happy then, and thrice bleſſed ſhall the Saints and ſeruants of God be accounted, that liue continually in the Court of heauen, the very Paradiſe and Pallace of God himſelfe?Pſal. 16.11. 
                        Bleſſed (indeed) are they that enioy the pleaſures of his houſe, in whoſe ſight is the fulneſſe of ioy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for euermore.
                     
                     
                        
                           section 10 It was Moſes honour to ſee Gods hinder parts, though poſſibly he could not ſee his face and liue:Exod. 34.6. Exod. 33.20. and ſhall it not be then in incomparable ioy and felicitie to the faithfull, to ſee his glorious face in heauen? If the preſence of God (ſaith one) were vpon hell, it would become the port of Paradiſe: So on the contrary, if the preſence of our ſins, miſeries, and woes, ſhould peſter heauen, and reach vnto the Saints, then ſhould heauen be turned into hell, reſt into toyle, peace into warre; life into death, &c. To conclude, as beautie ſeemes more excellent when it is paraleld with deformitie; ſo will heauen ſhew more glorious when it is compared with hell. Oh how happy, and bleſſed is hee which with the onely deſire and loue of eternitie pyneth away? Such a one is neither proud, with proſperitie, nor caſt downe with aduerſitie; for as hee hath nothing in this world that he loueth: ſo is there no loſſe of any thing in this life that he feareth. Sweete is the fountaine to the weary traueller, and reſt to the tyred ſeruant: Comfortable is the coole euening after a hot ſunny day; yet much more ſweet will it be to the Saints of this heauenly citie to haue peace after warre, pleaſure after paine, ioy after trouble, and conſtant ſecuritie after their ſo long indured ſorrowes. That Citie (ſaith Auguſtine) is ſcituate aboue all the elements, where no flouds can ariſe, no ſtormie windes can blow, no tempeſtuous waues can beate, &c.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. X. The aſſurance and certaintie which Gods Children haue of their ſaluation, and heauenly bliſſe.
                     
                        HItherto wee haue heard of our comfortable 
                           section 1 redemption by Ieſus Chriſt from Sin and Death, and of the heauenly fruits and effects that accompany the ſame, euen ioy and happines, heauen it ſelfe, and vnſpeakable bleſſedneſſe: It now remaineth (that nothing may be wanting to our harts deſire) to ſet downe (in few words) the ground and aſſurance that the godly haue for the vndoubted fruition of the former bleſſed eſtate: For it is not the bare knowledge of theſe things (which the very Diuels and damned may haue) but the ſound euidence, and the demonſtratiue and infallible concluſions that the faithfull finde and feele in their ſoules (to conuince the certaintie hereof to themſelues) that ſupporteth their Faith and Hope, till they inioy their expected happineſſe hereafter. It might be ſufficient (in this reſpect) to perſwade vs, (if our faith were not ſo weake) that God hath promiſed the performance of theſe things; that the ground of his promiſe is his written Word, which cannot deceiue vs, no more then God can deny himſelfe; which word the faithfull beleeuing, haue enioyed the promiſe, and had the end of their faith,Heb. 11.33. 1 Pet. 1.9. euen the ſaluation of their ſoules, yet for our further reſolution herein, I will dwell a little longer on this poynt.
                     One demanding the proofe of another life, was asked 
                           section 2 (for his anſwere) whether hee beleeued there was a God? which being granted, it ſufficeth (ſaid the anſwerer;) for if there be a God, hee is righteous; if hee be righteous, hee muſt in iuſtice reward the good and puniſh the wicked: Now wee know that many naughty men liue here in pompe and pleaſure, and ſeeme to dye in peace; and

likewiſe many good men in continuall anguiſh and affliction, conſuming away with ſorrow and griefe to death it ſelfe. If therefore there be a righteous God, it cannot be choſen but there is another life, when theſe good men ſhall reſt in bliſſe, and wicked men in woe. For it is a righteous thing with God to recompence their tribulation which trouble his children, and to giue reſt to his that are troubled: which though many times it be not executed in this life,2 Theſ. 1.6.10. yet the Apoſtle concludeth it to be certainly accompliſhed at the comming of Chriſt the righteous Iudge.
                     
                        
                           section 3 It cannot be wee ſhould know the grace and loue of God, (which is our Faith) but wee muſt know the fruit of his loue, that is, his glory, and eternall life (which is our Hope▪) If therefore wee be ſure that God doth loue vs in Ieſus Chriſt, wee are alſo as ſure, that God will glorifie vs through Ieſus Chriſt. And as our Faith reioyceth in Gods fauour, ſo our Hope reioyceth in Gods glory. And as our Faith is ſure,Rom. 8.39. that nothing ſhall ſeparate the loue of God from vs; ſo our Hope longeth after the incorruptible inheritance which wee feele and know to be laid vp for vs in heauen. So that this conſtancie and boldneſſe of our hope without wauering, laid vp in our hearts, cryeth ſtill within vs,Apoc. 22 20. 
                        come quickly Lord Ieſus; and this hope is our warrant, that we are the ſons of God: which confuteth all ſuch as conceiue no other thing of hope, then to deſire to haue a thing whereof we doubt; for being demanded whither they be ſure to be ſaued? they anſwer, they can haue no aſſurance, for then how could they hope? Thus they make hope a doubtfull deſire of a thing they wiſh, inſtead of a preſent feeling of the thing they long for. But we are then indeede the children of God,Heb. 4.6. if we hold the reioycing of our hope ſtedfaſt and ſure vnto the end.
                     
                        
                           section 4 Neither muſt Chriſtians be diſcouraged, though their hoped-for glory come not ſo ſoone as it is looked for; for God giueth them the plaſtour of patience, which ſhall ſuffice and ſupport their hope, for he is ſure that hath promiſed,Heb. 10.36.37. but not to be preſcribed a time by vs; but he muſt take

his own time, & our patience muſt preuent al diſtruſt. Faith is the foundation of our hope; for what can we hope for except we beleeue it? as the ground of faith is the word & promiſe; for why ſhould we beleeue, but in reſpect of Gods promiſe? Faith telleth vs, we beate not the ayre: hope biddeth vs hold on our race, finiſh the courſe, fight the combat, and then expect the crowne of glory: yea, Faith is faſtened by hope, that it doe not wander, and is continued by hope,2 Tim 4.7.8. that it doe not haſten but wait the time; & it is confirmed by hope, that we may hold on the Faith. Example we haue in the Cananitiſh woman,Mat. 15.22. who ſuffered three denials of Chriſt, each of them doubled, with ſeuerall reproaches, yet her faith was relieued by her hope, and ſhe had her deſire. So Iacob wreſtled with God by Faith, and in an aſſured hope,Gen. 32.26. told him flatly to his face that he would not let him goe vntill he had bleſſed him: Faith will not flye or yeeld a foot to her ſpirituall foes, and hope will neuer be foyled: It is the ſure and certaine anchor of ſafety,Heb. 6.19. to keepe both ſhip and ſailes from dangerous ſhipwracke.
                     The ſaile that maketh the Ship of our life to ride merily 
                           section 5 (amidſt the loftie ſurges of the Sea of this troubleſome world) is our apparant and ſtedfaſt profeſſion of faith in Chriſt; taking hold of the middle-maſt of his promiſes, and neſtling it ſelfe in them (as Doues in the holes of rocks) hoyſting vp rhe harts of the godly aboue al earthly things, giuing them a ſafe thorow-fare and free paſſage, through all the ſtormes and tempeſts of this wretched life. The Apoſtle bringeth forth a cloud of examples of ſuch (who by the ſailes of faith) haue paſſed the pikes of this dangerous nauigation,Heb. 11.39. & 12.1. and haue happily arriued at the heauenly hauen of reſt. A faithfull heart is furniſhed (like a Ship of warre) with ſhot and powder, and other ſtrong munition, which will ſurely make all helliſh Pyrots and fleſhly force, either to pull in their heads, or betake them to their heeles. The Diuell and diuelliſh men, can neuer ſinke our Ship with all their ſubtilties: ſo long as wee caſt our faith and hope vpon Chriſt Ieſus the corner-ſtone? but if it daſh vpon the rockes of ſinne, it is in danger.Iona. 1.4.12.15 
                        Ionahs ſin had welnigh

ſunke the Ship. A Ship may more ſafely carry any Paſſenger then a fugitiue which is a vagrant and runaway from God,
                           Epiphan.
                         ſo ſaith Epiphanius. So long therefore as the rocke of ſinne is in our way, we can make no way towards heauen; wherefore let vs caſt away our ſinnes into the Sea (as Ionah was;) for with this ſacrifice, the Sea of Gods wrath was appeaſed.
                     
                        
                           section 6 Wee can haue no certaine knowledge of heauenly things but by faith, for ſuch is their nature that they can no otherwiſe be knowne, for ſome of them are paſſed, and ſome to come; ſome in heauen, ſome in hell. Againe, God (whom our faith principally apprehendeth) dwelleth in that light that none can attaine,1 Tim. 6.16. Exod. 33.20. Ioh. 15. Eſa. 45.45. wee muſt therefore beleeue the Sonne ſpeaking of his Father, & ſearch to whom the Sonne hath reueiled him, ſince wee cannot ſee him with our eyes. God onely is to be beleeued touching himſelfe, who onely knoweth himſelfe, and he well beleeueth God, who beleeueth his teachers (in whom God ſpeaketh.) Neither is it ſtrange why wee ſhould beleeue God alone concerning himſelfe, ſince we muſt credit a mortall man touching his owne ſecrets, whoſe ſpirit (next God) knoweth beſt what is in him.1 Cor. 2.11. Humane vnderſtanding (in diuine things) is as the ſight of an Owle againſt the Sunne: Such things are knowne (by faith) in Gods word. Since God is the higheſt, it is not poſſible to reach him (by the ladder of our reaſon) no more then a Dwarfe can reach ſo high as a huge and tall Gyant. Now we cannot ſee Gods face, but he is couered vnder ſomething (as with a vaile) yea, ſometime in ſuch things as are contrary to his nature. As for vs to behold his mercy in his anger. In bringing vs to hell, Faith ſeeth him bringing vs to heauen; in darkeneſſe it beholdeth his brightneſſe; in hyding his face, it beholdeth his chearefull countenance.
                     
                        
                           section 7 And did not Iob ſee God (as they ſay) vnder Sathans cloake? for who caſt fire from heauen vpon his goods? who ouerthrew his houſe, and ſlew his children? who ſtirred vp ſtrangers to driue away his cattell, but Sathan himſelfe?

and yet Iob peirced (with the ſight of his faith) through all theſe inſtruments, and actions,Iob 1.21. confeſſing plainely, that as the Lord had giuen them, ſo the Lord had taken them away, and ſo praiſed his name. And how often did holy Dauid (amidſt the ſhadowes of Death) ſee life it ſelfe? For Faith is of things abſent,Heb. 11.1. of things hoped for, of things deſired; and can wee deſire any thing wee know not? and is there of heauenly things any other true knowledge, then by faith grounded vpon the word of God? Let vs ſend then our faith in beleeuing, and our hope in expecting (as Ioſuah ſent meſſengers before) to view that heauenly countrie that God hath promiſed to giue vs, and theſe meſſengers will bring vs word,Ioſuah 2.1. that the eye hath not ſeene, nor the eare heard, nor heart of man conceiued the excellencie thereof,
                        1 Cor. 2.9. which ſhould moue all faithfull men to giue this world willing farewell.
                     He that is eternall hath promiſed theſe things, and he is 
                           section 8 eternall through whom he hath promiſed them, and the things that be promiſed are eternall, bringing eternall felicitie to the beleeuers, and euerlaſting deſtruction to the infidels. Againe, the gifts and graces of God are not without delay; no delay in the creation, no delay in the redemption, no delay in the comming of the holy Ghoſt, for ſuddenly it fell; and ſhall we ſurmiſe a delay (after the deſolution of our bodies by death) when we haue fought a good fight, finiſhed our courſe and kept the faith? No, no, Chriſt Ieſus ſtandeth ready with a crowne in his hand (ouer the heads of all his Saints) to put it on, when they haue put off this fleſh. Our ſaluation in Chriſt is alwayes freſh and new. If once I be within the new couenant, it is an euerlaſting couenant: I was not taken vnder condition of time, nor no time ſhall preuaile againſt mee. Our Chriſtian ſtate and condition is not changeable (as Adams was in Paradiſe) but it is made ſure in the body of Chriſt, vnited with the perſon of the godhead, & ſo are the waies in which wee are led into it immutable: Our faith is not extinguiſhed, our loue cannot be quenched, our hope

faileth not, nor the holy ſpirit can euer be taken from vs, but ſtill they are new to vs to eternall life.
                     
                        
                           section 9 And as for the wicked, they ſhall be as well able to ſaue themſelues without God, as to hurt vs hauing God; and the worſt they can doe, is but to ſend vs to God. And for Sathans darts caſt out againſt vs, they are turned aſide in the armour of Chriſt:Apoc. 12.16. 2 Cor. 12.7 9. Eſay 53.5. his flouds can neuer drowne vs, and his buffetings ſhall be as our preſeruatiues againſt preſumption. Chriſt our head was wounded for our ſins, and is healed againe, raigning and triumphing in heauen; why then ſhould we which beleeue in him haue our hearts heauie in earth, as though the head had forgotten the body, or any part thereof? No, let vs not doubt that he will ſuffer a haire thereof to periſh, which he ſo dearely purchaſed. Michael (I meane our captaine Chriſt) hath conquered that dreadfull red dragon,Apoc. 12.7.8.9. and ſubtill ſerpent (with his leaders, and liuetenants) death and hell; why ſhould we be ſo much moued with any force of fleſh and bloud, or any miſchiefe the world can worke vs?
                     
                        
                           section 10
                        Be of good cheare (ſaith Chriſt) I haue ouercome the world.
                        Ioh. 6.33. Seeing hee hath broken the head of our enemie what ſhould his taile ſo much trouble vs? Seeing hee hath taken away our ſinnes, what ſhould any ſorrow remaine amongſt vs? God doth not chooſe them worthy, but in chooſing them maketh them worthy. He hath all in himſelfe, which hath himſelfe, and hee hath himſelfe which hath God, and he hath God who beleeueth, and confeſſeth his creatour:
                           Chriſoſt.
                         but he that hath loſt his faith, hath nothing elſe to looſe. Chriſt hath ſaid it (and it is a warrant to our wearied ſoules) that thoſe that his father hath giuen him, may be where he is, to behold his glory. This is his will,Ioh. 17.24. and who dare wreſt it? the head will haue his members, the Bridegroome his ſpouſe, God his elect, and Chriſt his redeemed; and where will he haue them, but where he is? and that is in heauen.
                     So much what Death is in Chriſt. Now followeth our preparation thereunto.

                  THE THIRD BOOKE. Of preparation vnto DEATH.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. I. The neceſſitie of preparation, with the motiues: the remembrance of Death much auaileth thereunto, to the godly; and the careleſneſſe of moſt men herein.
                     
                        FOr as much as the beſt things are 
                           section 1 not eaſily attained vnto (being ſo precious and excellent in themſelues) without the hardeſt labour and greateſt attempt (vile and eaſie things being vſually moſt common, and theſe ſo rare:) Our moſt wiſe and prouident God (to whet our affections, and to ſharpen our deſires to heauen and heauenly things) hath inioyned vs a taske to be performed before we can aſpire to our happy perfection:Luk. 14.28. For hauing the ſumptuous tower of our ſaluation to build, we muſt firſt ſit downe and reckon our coſts it will ſtand vs in: The crowne of glory being propoſed,2 Tim. 4 7 wee muſt firſt fight the battaile of faith without being foyled: And the garland of ſaluation being hung vp (as it were) before our eyes, we muſt ſtriue to run the race, without tyring,1 Cor. 9.24. vntill

we come to the goale, where we muſt receiue the prize of our paines with endleſſe profit.
                     
                        
                           section 2 The dominions of heauen (I confeſſe) are great and large,Luk. 14.24. but the way thither is narrow and ſtraight, and we muſt ſtriue to enter in.: the wicket-doore is ſmall, and the throng great;Mat. 11.12. therefore we muſt vſe a godly violence, to thruſt our ſelues in, if we will be ſaued. Now the way wee haue heard already, and the doore of our entrance (which is death) hath ſufficiently beene deſcribed: It onely remaineth that we be chriſtianly fitted and prepared for the entrance. Conſtant therefore we muſt be in our courſe, & condition of life, enioyned vs of God: for what auaileth it the Sea-faring man, to haue ſailed ſafely through the ſurging Seas, to haue eſcaped dangerous ſyrts and ſands, the craggie rockes and rough paſſages, if yet he be ſunke, or ſuſtaine Shipwrake in the hauen? What profiteth it the Souldier, or moſt corragious Captaine, to haue giuen many on-ſets in the battaile, and foyles to his foes; if yet he be killed before he ouercome? It booteth not to run ourſelues breathleſſe in the race, if we get not the goale; and we ſhoote but at Rouers if wee miſſe the marke. This world therefore being as a Sea; a field, a race, and a marke to all Gods elect: Let them ſo ſaile therein, as they may come ſafely to the ſhoare; ſo fight in this field, that they may ouercome; ſo runne that they may obtaine, and ſo ſhoote that they miſſe not the marke: that is, that they may after this life, come to the expectation of their hope, end of their trauell, euen the bleſſed immortalitie of euerlaſting life.
                     
                        
                           section 3 We all with our lips confeſſe that we muſt die, and that death is the gate either to heauen or hell, and yet not one of vs (amongſt milions of men) ſo religiouſly ſpend, and paſſe their daies, as hoping to goe to heauen, or fearing the way to hell. If we be once reſolued that in extremitie of ſickneſſe we cannot eſcape with life, there is none of vs that is not very ſorry that euer he offended God; liuing in drunkenneſſe, adulterie, deceit, riot, or in any ſuch

exceſſe, or bad courſe of life, without Gods feare; then will euery one wiſh, that he had better ſerued God, &c. Such are vaine mens complaints, and late lamentations. Yet now (whiles God vouchſafeth meanes and time to liue) why doe we not prepare our ſelues in time? Why haſten wee not to liue in ſuch ſort, as at the day of death wee wiſh we had. For looke how Death leaueth a man, ſo ſhall the laſt Iudgement finde him. In this life there may be changes and conuerſions from euill to good, but after death there can be none at all: for looke where the tree falleth,
                        Eccleſ. 11.3. 
                        there it lyeth, whether towards the North or towards the South. Neede wee haue ro gird vp our loynes,1 Pet. 1.13. Mat. 25.4. and to get Oyle for our Lampes, at all aſſayes, for the ſodaine and vncertaine comming of the Bridge-groome.
                     Our corrupt and curſed nature will ſtill make vs careleſſe 
                           section 4 of our end: naturally wee are giuen to cocker our ſelues with fleſhly dreames of continuall peace and ſecuritie, and there is none ſo olde, but hee hopeth ſtill to liue longer, as though he were in league with Death and Graue.Eſay 28.95. But it is too late to beginne then to liue, when wee muſt leaue our worldly beeing:
                           Seneca de breuit, vitae.
                         therefore to know our ſelues well, we had neede to make ſome tryall; and who can doe this that neuer came to proofe? Vertue deſires danger, and obſerues to what it tends, what the ſcope thereof is; and not what ſhee muſt endure for to attaine to the ſame: for euen her very endurance is a great part of her glory. A Pilot may be well knowne in time of a tempeſt, a Souldier in the heate of battell. It is alwayes beſt fighting with a knowne enemie, and what ſhall an vnskilfull warriour doe that knowes not the nature, ſubtilly, weapons and policie of his aduerſary?
                     A good Houſe-holder maketh prouiſion for himſelfe,
                           section 5 and family, and buyeth (before hand) all neceſſary prouiſion, according to his power: much more ought a Chriſtian to prepare before, for that life that endureth to all eternitie. Some doe as the wife, that would giue none of her pottage, to any, till her pot was ouer-throwne, and

then calleth in the poore. With this penaltie (ſaith Auguſtine) is a ſinner puniſhed,
                        
                           Auguſt.
                         
                        that when hee dyeth, hee forgetteh himſelfe, who in his life time thought not vpon God. If a theefe be brought from the priſon, eyther to the Barre to be arraigned before the Iudge, or to the place of execution, hee will bewayle his miſdemeanour paſt, and promiſe reformation of life, if ſo be hee might be deliuered. In this caſe, we are as fellons: for wee are euery day going to the barre of Gods Iudgement-ſeate there is no ſtay or ſtanding in the way: Euen as the ſhip in the ſea continues in her courſe day and night, whether the Mariners be ſleeping or waking: therefore let vs prepare our ſelues betimes, that in death we may make a happy end.
                     
                        
                           section 6 Many thouſand ſoules (as rockt aſleepe in the cradle of ſecuritie in this ſeducing world) doe ſodainly finde themſelues within the gates of hell (yet liuing on earth) before they be aware: For they are led through the vale of this preſent life (as it were blindefolded with the vizard of ſenſuall luſts) like beaſts to the ſlaughter-houſe,Prou. 7.22. and neuer eſpie their dangerous eſtate before it be too late: And moſt men are ready to take their farewell of the world, before they thinke of their condition in the world; and then they would beginne to direct their courſe aright, when the time requireth them to make an end. But one ſaith otherwiſe of himſelfe, (drawing towards the period of his life) When I was a young man, my care was how to liue well;
                        
                           Seneca Ep. 32. 
                        ſince age came on, my care hath beene how to dye well.
                        
                           Auguſt.
                         
                        In this life (ſaid Auguſtine) nothing is ſo ſweet vnto me, as to prepare for my peaceable paſſage from this pilgrimage of ſinne, to life and happineſſe. Alas wee encumber our ſelues with many things (as Martha did) not regarding (as wee ſhould) that onely needfull thing,Luke 10.41. to ſerue our God in life and death. The tempeſt before expected doth leſſe amaze vs when the ſtorme ſhall ariſe: Hee that leaues the world before the world leaues him, and thinkes of his death (as the ſicke man harkneth to the clock) ſhall ſay with Simeon;
                        Luke 2.29. 
                        Now let thy ſeruant depart in peace.
                     
                     
                        That which fooliſh men would gladly doe in the end,
                           section 7 ſhould wiſe men doe in the beginning. It is beſt, with Noah,
                        Gen. 6.22. & 41.48. to build an Arke while the ſeaſon is faire and calme; with prouident Ioſeph, to lay vp ſtore of prouiſion in the dayes of plenty, before the time of dearth and penury come to pinch vs; while the weather is faire to thinke of a ſtrome, and when opportunitie is offered to follow our thriuing husbandry; ſtill ſowing the ſeede of godly actions, in the field of a repentant heart, that ſo (in the Autumne and end of our age) we may reape the fruit of euerlaſting comfort, for our happy harueſt and prouiſion to come. It falleth out to vaine men, many times in their death, (as to Pages and Seruitors in the Court) who being allowed a candle to light themſelues to bed, doe ſpend it in playing and vngodly ſports, & are afterwards conſtrained to goe to bed darklings: So wicked men do waſte the light of life by ſinne and vanitie, and at laſt are void of comfort and knowledge at the houre of death. Therefore as our whole life is a paſſage to death, ſo ſhould wee make it a preparing for death; that how ſoone ſoeuer the body returneth to the earth, the ſoule may be as ſure to goe to heauen. Let vs doe that before death, which may doe vs good after death, and then ſooner or later death ſhall not hurt vs, which is only euill to the euill, and good to the good. If God offer grace to day, thou knoweſt not whether he will offer the ſame to morrow, and therefore now vſe it, if thou wilt be ſure to vſe it at all. The light will ſhine, when we ſhall not ſee the cloſing in of the day; the euening will come, when we ſhall not ſee againe the breaking forth of the morning light.
                     It behooueth euery one not ſo much (with Ezekiah) to ſet 
                           section 8 his houſhold in order for that hee muſt dye,Eſay 38.1. as to ſet his ſoule in order, his conuerſation in order, for that after death there is ſomewhat more behinde,Heb. 9.27. 2 Kings 5.26. and that is called a time of iudgement. Eliſha could ſay to his ſeruant, Is this a time to take rewards? and amidſt the pangs of death, is that a time to thinke of amendment of life? Saint Peter
                        
ſaith, Be ſober and watch, for your aduerſary the Diuell goeth about like a roaring Lion, &c. As if hee ſhould ſay; Watch, for you haue a watchfull aduerſary; if yee reſpect his old experience, hee was in Paradiſe; if his nature, a Lion; if his cruelty, a roaring Lion; if his diligence, hee ſeeketh; if his intent, that is, to deuoure: we had need then to watch hauing ſo watchfull an enemie.Marke 13.33. Luke 21.42. 
                        Watch (ſaith Chriſt) becauſe yee know not the houre when the Sonne of man will come: As if he had ſaid; Becauſe yee know not the houre, watch euery houre; becauſe yee know not the month, watch euery month, becauſe yee know not the yeare, watch euery yeare. Why doe wee not then keepe a continuall watch ouer our ſoules, ſince we know not at what houre Death will aſſaile vs?
                     
                        
                           section 9 Carnall men are ſo inchanted with the harlot-like allurements of ſinne, and ſo carryed away by the violent ſtreame of ſenſuall ſecuritie, as that they quite and cleane forget all remembrance of their end, and become worſe then Idols which haue eyes and ſee not, yea, a reaſonable ſoule, and vnderſtand not. But this is Sathans ſlight, whoſe buſineſſe was, and is, at, and ſince the fall of the firſt man, with this bloudy ſword, to ſlay mens ſoules; T
                              •
                           ſh,
                        Gen. 3.4. 
                        you ſhall not dye at all: As if hee would haue vs to thinke the remembrance of death but a melancholy conceipt; and leſt it ſhould make too deepe an impreſſion of the feare of God in mans heart, hee will haue the forbidden tree to delight the eye, fayre words to pleaſe the eare, and driue all away. Why? You ſhall be as Gods: when his drift is to make them all as Diuels. What a dangerous Lethargie of the ſoule is this, when ſo many ſpectacles of mans mortalitie, before our eyes, can nothing moue vs? or at leaſt our mouing (with Agrappa) is not much,Acts 26.28. but ſomewhat, which by and by is all forgot and gone; and ſo wee thinke of our end, by ſome running fits, and haue done. Wee will and wee will not, and ſo (with the Sluggard) nothing is done. Some count it death to meditate of death, they like

the remembrance of it, as Ahab the preſence of Eliah,
                        1 Kings 18.17. to be troubleſome to them.
                     Let fooles (as they doe) make but a ſport of ſinne, and 
                           section 10 ſay with the old Epicures,Prou. 10.23. 
                        What haue wee to doe with Death? They ſhall one day finde that Death will haue to doe with them, when hee ſhall ſtrip them into their winding ſheete, binde them hand and foot, and make their laſt bed to be the darke and ſlimy graue.1 Kings 22.8. 
                        Ahab could not abide to heare Micheas ſpeake, for that hee neuer propheſied any good, but euill vnto him; hee would be wicked, and yet could not endure to heare any other newes then good: So wicked men cannot away to heare of death, becauſe they liue a ſinfull life.Numb. 23.10. 
                        Balaam deſires to dye the death of the righteous, but hee will neuer vndergoe to liue the life of the righteous. As Pharaoh ſaid to Moſes;
                        Exod. 12.31. 
                        Depart from among my people: ſo ſay the vngodly to Death, Be baniſhed from vs; thy preſence, thy ſhadow, and the very remembrance of thee is fearefull vnto vs. To muſe of their end is the leaſt of moſt mens thoughts. To heare Saint Paul ſpeake of Gods terrible iudgement to come,Acts 24.25. is too trembling a doctrine for our delightfull diſpoſitions to heare: with Foelix wee are not at leaſure, for this is iarring Muſicke, which ſounds not aright in the Conſort of our worldly pleaſures. To thinke of Death is Acheldama (ſaith one) euen a field of bloud: but waſtfully to ſpend the time in the dangerous delights of ſinne, and ſo to be flattered with promiſe of peace and pleaſure, is a tuneable Dittie to moſt mens eares, vntill their ſoules ſo ſleepe in ſinne, as Siſera ſlept, who neuer woke againe.Iudg. 4.21. But if any Phyſitian would take vpon him to make men liue euer in this world, what a multitude of Patients ſhould he haue? and how well would they reward him? Alas poore fooles, they are earth, and will not know it. But will the forgetfulneſſe of death preſerue them from dying?
                     But Plato ſaid truely, that there was no more honourable 
                           section 11 Philoſophy for a mortall man, then the daily meditation of his mortalitie and death: for the remembrance

of death (through Gods bleſſing) ſerues as a ſounding Bell to awake vs from the ſleepe of our ſinnes, and as a ſpurre to pricke vs on to vertue, as a bridle to reſtraine our greedy deſires, as an oyntment for our eyes, to make vs clearely ſee the foulneſſe of our ſinne, whereof the Diuell is the father, Death his fruit, and Hell his dwelling place. Remembrance of Death is as the match and tinder, that nouriſheth and inlighteneth the fire of all holy deuotion; the Bellowes that kindle all godly affections; it is (as it were) the Fanne that ſeuereth from our ſoules the duſt and chaffe of all vanitie and ſinne; it ſerueth as a Pilot to gouerne the right courſe of our life, who ſtands euer behinde in the ſhip▪ to conduct it the better to the deſired Port; it is better Muſicke then that of Dauids Harpe to Saul,
                        1 Sam. 16.16.22. againſt all the raging fits and furies of all infernall Spirits.
                     
                        
                           section 12 Shew me a promiſe that you ſhall liue, but to morrow; or hauing this aſſurance, that to morrow ſhall giue you light; or if it appeare, whether you ſhall ſee the light? Shew mee (I ſay) the promiſe, and liue to morrow: But what doe I ſay?
                           Seneca.
                         It may be thou ſhalt liue long; wilt thou liue a long life and a wicked together, and be in danger to end thy life by a miſerable and wretched death? As the Husbandman is carefull to caſt ſeede into the ground, whileſt faire weather laſteth; and the Merchant to lay out his money, whileſt the Mart and good Market endureth: ſo muſt Chriſtians take the time and good opportunitie offered;Iohn 9.4. for the night will come, when no man can worke. We muſt vſe Gods mercies to our gaine, and not to our damnation.2 Kings 1.13. When the third Captaine ouer fifty, ſaw how his two fellow-Captaines were deuoured with fire, it went ſo neare his heart, that hee went vp, and fell downe, and beſought the man of God, that his life might be precious in his ſight: But how many thouſands of our fellow-ſouldiers haue wee heard and ſeene to fall in this ſpirituall fight? How many of our deareſt friends haue taken their leaue, and yet none or very few, maketh ſupplication (I

ſay not to the man of God) but to God himſelfe, that our liues and deaths may be precious in his ſight? Oftentimes hath God knocked at the doore of our hearts, to put vs in minde of our mortalitie; for who hath not had experience of his declining nature? But yet for all this, what little humbling of our ſelues is there before him, whoſe dominion reacheth vnto the ends of the earth,1 Sam. 2.6. who bringeth to the graue, and raiſeth vp againe?
                     The perfection of knowledge is to know God and our 
                           section 13 ſelues aright: and our ſelues then wee beſt know, when wee haue throughly learned our mortall eſtate. As men wee dye naturally; as Chriſtians wee dye religiouſly: wee muſt firſt dye to the world, that after wee may liue to God. By our dying to the world,Gal. 2.20. Chriſt Ieſus commeth and liueth in vs; and by our dying in the world,Phil. 1.23. wee are ſure to goe to liue with Chriſt. Wee dye not (ſaith one) becauſe wee are ſicke, but becauſe wee liue; ſo when wee recouer our ſickneſſe, wee eſcape not from death, but from the diſeaſe. Let vs therefore make that voluntary, which is neceſſary (ſaith S. Chriſoſtome) and yeeld it to God as a gift, which wee ſtand bound to pay as a debt.
                           Chriſoſt. Hom. 10 in Mat.
                         We muſt not (ſaith Ambroſe) neyther loath to liue nor feare to dye, becauſe wee haue a good and gracious Lord.
                           Ambroſe.
                         No good thing can be well and perfectly done at the firſt; ſeeing therefore it is ſo great a matter to dye, and ſo neceſſary to dye well, it is expedient that in our life we learne to dye often, that we may at laſt dye well, at the very time of death.
                     The Souldiers that be appoynted to fight, doe firſt practiſe themſelues in the field, to learne in time of peace what they muſt doe in time of warre. The horſe that muſt runne at the Tilt, trauerſeth all that ground before, and tryeth all the ſteps thereof, that when hee commeth to make his courſe, he be not found new and ſtrange to doe his feate. Wherefore ſince all muſt runne this race, and trauerſe this courſe of death (which is ſo long and large, reaching from earth to heauen) conſidering withall the

danger, that whoſoeuer faileth in the way, and goeth not vpright, ſhall tumble headlong into the pit of hell, it requires our beſt diligence and endeuour to the vtmoſt.To guide the ſhip along the ſeas is a poynt of skill, but at the very entrance into the Hauen it ſelfe, then to auoyd the dangerous rockes, and to caſt our anchor skilfully in a ſafe Roade, is the chiefeſt cunning. To runne the race in a good order, is the part of a ſtout and valiant Champion, but ſo to runne that wee may obtaine the crowne, is the very perfection of al his paines. What more Chriſtian-like then a good and holy life? but after this life finiſhed, to dye in the Faith and feare of God, what more diuine? Wherefore there is nothing ſo glorious as to order aright the vpſhot of our time, and farewell from this world. To end well this life, is onely to end it willingly, following with full conſent the will and direction of God, and not ſuffering our ſelues to be drawne by meere neceſſitie. To end it willingly, is to hope for, and not to feare our death appoynted of God. To hope for it, wee muſt certainly looke after this life for a better. To looke for it, we muſt feare God, whom who ſo well feareth, feareth (indeed) nothing elſe in this world, and hopes for all things in the world to come.
                     
                        
                           section 15 To one well reſolued in theſe poynts, Death can be but ſweet and agreeable to his minde: for what can hee feare, whoſe death is his hope? Thinke wee to baniſh him his Countrey? hee knowes hee hath a Countrey elſewhere, from whence none can exile him; and that all theſe Countries are but Innes, out of which hee muſt depart at the will of his Hoſt. Thinke wee to impriſon him? a more ſtrait priſon he cannot haue then his owne body, none more filthy, or more darke; &c. Will we kill him, and take him out of this world? that is it he hopes for.
                           Ph. Mor.
                         It is all one to him, at what gate, or at what time he paſſeth out of this miſerable life: for his buſineſſes then are for euer ended, his affayres all diſpatched, and by what way hee ſhall goe out, by the ſame hee ſhall enter into a

moſt happy, and an euerlaſting life. The threatnings of Tyrants are to him promiſes; the ſwords of his greateſt enemies are drawne in his fauour, for as much as hee knowes that threatning him death, they threaten him life, and the moſt mortall wounds can make him but immortall: for who feares God, feares not death, and who feares it not, feares not the worſt of this life.
                     Why doe we daily pray, that Gods Kingdome may come,
                           section 16 ſeeing we take ſuch delight to remaine in the priſon of this world? Why heape we prayers vpon prayers,Mat. 6.10. that the generall reſtauration of all things may approach,Rom. 8.23. if our greater and more affectionate deſires would rather ſerue here below, the enemy of our ſoules, then to raigne aboue with Ieſus Chriſt? It belongs to him that taketh all his pleaſure in the world, who is caught with the baits of earthly delights, and the flatteries of the fleſh, to deſire to tarry long in this world. But ſeeing it hateth the Children of God, why loue they ſuch an enemy? why followeſt thou not rather Ieſus Chriſt thy Redeemer, who ſo ardently loues thee? Let euery day be to thee as the laſt day, ſince thou knoweſt not whether thou ſhalt liue till to morrow or no. For ſtill wee carry death about in our mortall bodies, and our life (in a continuall motion) ſtil haſtneth to an end.Pſal. 90.12. And yet no man marketh how his time paſſeth. S. Paul ſaith Idye daily,
                        1 Cor. 15.31. (for euen in the midſt of life wee are in death,) and the whole time of our life is but a running vnto death. Therefore ſeeing Death watcheth for vs on euery ſide, wiſedome it is to watch for him, that he take vs not tardy.
                     The remembrance of our end muſt be as a Key to open 
                           section 17 the day, and ſhut in the night; this will make young men more heedfull in their waies, and old men more fearefull of their works, and all men more prouident of the time to come. There is no meanes more effectuall, to make vs ſhake off the allurements of this life (as Paul did the Viper into the fire) then the daily meditation of our end.Acts 28.5. God leads Ieremie into a houſe of clay,Ier. 18.2. before hee inſtructeth him in his meſſage: to teach vs, that we are beſt leſſoned,

where our fraile eſtate may be beſt conſidered. Did wee but ſomtimes behold that pale horſe (whoſe name is Death) in our muſing diſpoſition,Reuel. 6.8. it would make vs trample vnderfoote many alluring occaſions of vanitie and ſinne, which we purſue faſt. Die we muſt needes, becauſe our bodies are full of ſinne, and ſo die we muſt willingly, that we may be deliuered from this body of ſinne. Die we muſt becauſe we are full of corruption, and muſt be changed; and die we muſt willingly, as deſirous to put on incorruption,2 Cor. 5. that ſo we may behold our God. Die we muſt needs, becauſe we beare the image of earthly men, & die we muſt willingly, that we may be like the new and heauenly man, Chriſt Ieſus. Die we muſt needes, becauſe God hath ſo ordained;1 Cor. 15. and let vs die willingly, to ſhew our obedience to his wil. Chriſtians muſt be as Birds on a bough, to remoue at Gods pleaſure, and that without reſiſtance, when the 
                           section 18 Lord ſhall viſite them.
                     Vpon this condition we entred this world, to goe out of it againe; and this is the law of Nations, to reſtore and pay that which wee haue borrowed, and retained for a time. Our life is a pilgrimage or iourney; when here we haue trauelled much and long, at length needes wee muſt returne to our home. Againe, it is abſurd to feare that which we cannot ſhun; thou art neither the firſt, nor the laſt,2 Cor. 5.1. thouſands haue gone before thee, and all that are to come ſhall follow thee. Wee are but Tenants at will, in this cleyie farme; the foundation of this building is weake in ſubſtance; alwayes kept cold by an entercourſe of aire; the piller whereupon the whole frame and building doth ſtand, is the paſſage of a little breath, the ſtrength of it ſome few bones tyed together with dry ſtrings or ſinewes; and howſoeuer we repaire & patch this ſimple cottage, it will at laſt fall into our land-lords hands, & we muſt ſurrender it when Death (the Lords Bailiefe) ſhall ſay this or that mans time is come: Therefore Chriſtians muſt haue theſe temporall things in vſe, but eternall things in deſire; It is written of thoſe Phyloſophers called Brackmani, that they

were ſo much giuen to thinke vpon their end, that they had their graues alwaies open before their gates, that both going out, and comming in, they might alwaies be mindefull of their death and latter end.
                           section 19
                     
                     I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the folly of our nature, ſo abhorring the mention of Death: yea, euen the aged men, whoſe ſpring is paſt, whoſe ſummer is ſpent, and are euen arriued at the fall of the leafe; whoſe heads are dyed with ſnowie winter colours, and whoſe ſhip begins to leake and grate vpon the grauell of their graues: yet how fearefully are they amazed, to heare the laſt ſound of Deaths trumpet! O fooliſh imbecilitie, ſo fearing to be luld a ſleepe in Deaths ſlumbering fits, which is ſo ready to cloſe vp this mortall day, to bring their ſoules to an euerlaſting morrow. Mans life (ſaith one) is a ſmall thing, but the contempt of this wretched life is a great thing. And why ſhould Chriſtians ſo loue this ſinfull life, and loath their death, which is ſo gainefull. Firſt it killeth our familiar enemy the fleſh, which luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and maketh vs that we cannot pleaſe God. Now there is no enemie like vnto a domeſticall and home-bred enemie, that lieth in our boſome, that reſts and ſleepes with vs, and is alwayes a companion to the ſoule, vrging and hailing it to ſinne; but Death openeth the doore of this filthy priſon,Gal. 5.17. and ſtinking dungeon, of this body of ſinne, in which we liue as ſlaues. It freeth vs from this pannier and dungcart we carry about, full of all corruption and vileneſſe; for this corruptible body is heauie vnto the ſoule, and this earthly manſion keepeth downe the minde, oppreſſing it with cares. It putteth an end to this our painefull pilgrimage, full of bitterneſſe and griefe. For what is this life but a heauie mierie way, clagging and tyring our feet and orher limbes?
                     Conſider then how abſurd it is, for poore drudges (ſo 
                           section 20 foyled and wearied) to be yet vnwilling to haue ſuch an irkeſome life and way ended. Our life is full of labour, t'is led with ſorrow, and yet left with teares; ſo that better

is death then ſuch a ſilly life. We thinke not ſo much how neare Death we approach (all of vs being reſerued to die) we complaine not ſo much of the thing it ſelfe,
                           Senec. de nat. queſt.
                         as of the day of our death: But would wee not thinke him a foole (who amongſt many other being condemned to die) would craue it as a great benefit, to be executed the laſt? So fooliſh are many, eſteeming it ſuch a matter to haue their death deferred, and a little to prolong their dayes. Malefactors hate nothing more then the giues and fetters, barres and bolts of the priſon doores, wherewith they haue beene loaded, and wherewith they haue beene incloſed; and we fooliſh men feare nothing more then the opening of this priſon doore, for our egreſſe and deliuery; we cannot abide it, we cannot indure to haue the locks and ſhuts (of this layle of our fleſh) to be broken and battered, for our euerlaſting manumiſſion from this ſeruitude and ſlauerie of ſinne.
                     
                        
                           section 21 Now then, if our whole life be nothing elſe but a continuall trauell to death (as wee haue heard) if the houre of death be alſo the dreadfull houre of Iudgement, what other thing is our whole life, but a continuall walking towards the tribunall ſeate of God?Rom. 14.10. And what great madneſſe is it, for men (going actually to be iudged) thus in the way to prouoke their Iudge to anger, by continuall ſinne? Let vs better open our eyes, and conſider the way wee take: let vs fore-caſt with our ſelues, to what place wee are going, and be aſhamed of our euils, or at the leaſt to aduiſe with our ſelues, how euill this that wee doe, agreeth with that buſineſſe wee haue in hand. What a wonder is this, that euery day we dye, and yet perſwade our ſelues to liue for euer? wee are like the Megarenſes (of whom the Phyloſopher ſpeaketh) in making proud and ſumptuous buildings, as though they ſhould alwayes liue, yet liuing as though they had but mortall ſoules.
                     
                        
                           section 22 But to haſten to an end. Whereof commeth ſo great forgetfulneſſe of almighty God, ſuch negligence of preparing

our ſelues to die? euen from hence, that we preſume our life ſhall laſt ſo long: This falſe imagination perſwadeth vs that we haue time inough for all things; for the world, for our pleaſures, for vanitie, for vices, for friuolous and curious exerciſes, and that yet for all this, we ſhall haue ſufficient time to prouide our ſelues to die; in ſo much as we dare diſpoſe of our life (as we will of a web of cloath (for our family) lying on a table) appointing one piece for this purpoſe, and another for that: ſo we make account of our liues, as though we had the ſignory and gouernment of times in our owne hands to order, and our life at our owne will and pleaſure to diſpoſe of. This fond conceit groweth and is grounded vpon ſelfe-loue, which alwaies hateth and abhorreth Death, to auoide the paine and griefe which otherwiſe it would conceiue. Such a one is eaſily induced to beleeue that another ſhall die, for as hee is not greatly in loue with others, ſo is not the knowledge and beliefe of that truth ſo ſowre and vnpleaſant vnto him, but as hee loueth himſelfe exceedingly, ſo is hee very loath to beleeue any thing that ſhould increaſe his paine and griefe. Yet ſee how ſuch a one is deceiued, hee firſt of all begins to lead the dance of death, and others (ſo cenſured) long after doe follow him. So that it fareth with theſe men, as with yong ſea-men, and freſh-water-ſouldiers, who when they come forth of the hauens mouth, it ſeemeth vnto them that the land and houſes depart away, when they themſelues indeede doe moue and paſſe away, the land and houſes ſtanding ſtill.
                     Of what impatiencie is it, not to endure that euill 
                           section 23 which together (with ſo many and mighty) is common vnto all men? Thou refuſeſt to pay the debt (with all Gods Saints) which whether thou wilt or no, muſt needs be diſcharged. Hee which by nature could not die, was for thy ſake made mortall, and ſubiect to death; and thou being borne to dye, and which ſo often for thy ſinnes haſt deſerued death, wouldeſt thou alone (amongſt all

other) be priuiledged from dying? Remember therefore thy folly and pride, and rather incourage thy ſelfe to die, hauing ſo many fellowes and partners in this caſe: For indeede wee haue no more cauſe to grieue that wee ſhall die, then wee haue to be vexed that wee were borne, or that wee were created mortall men, and not Angels immortall.
                           Senec. Ep. 36. Death bringeth an equall law, and an ineuitable neceſſitie ouer all. Now who can complaine for being of ſuch a condition, from which no man is excepted? for the chiefeſt point of equitie is equalitie. Let vs therefore pay our tribute chearefully, ſince wee cannot be releaſed; and let vs ſecond and follow the will of God without murmuring, from whom all things are iuſtly deriued; for Deſtinie leades him by the hand that goeth willingly, and drags him along that goeth by compulſion.
                           Senec. Ep. 121.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. How dangerous a thing it is not to be prepared for Death, or to deferre the time thereof.
                     
                        HAuing partly heard of the neceſſitie of preparation, 
                           section 1 let vs a little conſider of the dangerous want thereof; for Death being ſuch a fearefull enemie, we may not (without great hazard of our eſtates) meete him naked in the field, but knowing him and his forces, it is fit wee be throughly prepared againſt the combat. And albeit, we cannot of our ſelues make any prouiſion ſure inough to ſerue our turne (for it is not our owne ſtrength, counſell, or pollicie) that can ſtand vs in ſtead, in ſuch a fight) yet prouided we muſt be, if we will preuaile: neither is it Sauls harneſſe that will buckle handſomely to our backs, or any other furniture deuiſed by man,1 Sam. 17.29.40. but onely the ſling of faith, caſting out the ſtone taken out of that riuer, or rather that inuincible rocke Ieſus Chriſt, that will vtterly foyle this huge Goliah Death.
                     
                        For Gods children hauing continuall experience of his 
                           section 2 mighty power, in their worldly deliuerances and of his gracious protection and aide in all the miſeries and calamities of this life (feeling ſtill in themſelues, the ſufficiencie of his grace, and aſſiſtance of his ſpirit,1 Pet. 4.19. in all their extremities) they doubt not euer to commit their bodies and ſoules to this their faithfull creatour: They doe not feare to be ruled by him in life & death; no they will goe to God thorow fire & water; no dangerous paths will they eſchew when he cals them; they care not to goe thorow the vale of death (leaning on his ſtaffe) nor to ſayle as it were through hell, that they may come to heauen, to enioy his bleſſed ſight;Pſal. 23.4. knowing that by the ſuſteining of a temporall death, they are freed from eternall torments and endleſſe fire of hell. For although (at deaths firſt entrance,) a huge flood of ſinnes and a fountaine of ſorrowes iſſued out, yet now being altered by Chriſt, it killeth ſinne in Gods Saints, and perfecteth their eſtate. And ſo farre off is it from the deſtruction of a Chriſtian man, that it brings him to perfection; for after the death of the body, followes the freedome of the ſpirit, nay, it is the very furnace appointed of God, for the purifying both of body and ſoule from the droſſe of all corruption and ſinne.
                     But as it auaileth nothing (as I ſaid before) to goe to 
                           section 3 warre without weapons, or to keepe a Caſtle without munition; no more or leſſe can we withſtand deaths deadly force, our ſoules not harneſſed againſt the ſame. The greateſt cowards haue many times the greateſt talke, then it will onely appeare what thou haſt gained in knowledge, when thou commeſt to combat with Death: no man knowes in what place Death attends him, therefore in all places we muſt be prouided: What cares Death for priſons, for guards, for iron barres, &c. one gate or another ſtands alway open to him,
                           Senec. Ep. 26.27. there is but one chaine onely that keepes vs bound, euen the loue of this life, and this muſt not wholly be ſhaken off, but extenuated and

leſſened, that when occaſion ſerueth nothing may hinder vs. If euery day of our life were as long (as that long day of Ioſua) when as the Sunne ſtood ſtill a whole day in the middeſt of heauen,Ioſu. 10.13.14. it would auaile vs nothing: For as in the end the night came, which diſſolued that long day, ſo the night of death will at laſt aſſaile vs, and make the daies of our life vaniſh away, how long ſo euer they haue beene; for euery thing ſubiect to corruption fadeth, and he that troubleth himſelfe therewith ſhall paſſe away. Man is reſembled to a peece of rotten wood which breaking in peeces,Iob 14.7. is turned into powder.
                     
                        
                           section 4 This life is a moment of time, whereon all eternitie of life and death to come dependeth. If it be a moment, and a moment of ſo great importance, how is it paſſed ouer by worldly men ſo careleſly as it is? If Death be an enemie,1 Cor. 15.26. then let vs watch him as an enemy, preuent him as an enemie, that ſo we may endure his hard aſſaults when time ſhall ſerue. Doe that before death which may doe thee good when thou art dead;
                           Aug. de cura pro mortuis.
                         for if we prouide not before death, there is no prouiſion after. It is farre better to enter while the gate is open,Mat. 25.11. Eſa. 55.6. then afterwards to knocke in vaine when the gate is ſhut; to ſeeke the Lord while he may be found, then to be found of him vnprouided, when we would not be ſought. The morning was faire when Lot went out of Sodome,
                        Gen. 19.23. and yet before night it was burnt to aſhes: Nebuchadnezar neuer thought himſelfe ſo ſure as when he boaſted himſelfe of Babel,
                        Dan. 4.12. and (yet while the word was in his mouth) God puld him downe vpon his knees. The rich man neuer thought himſelfe ſo likely to liue, as when hee ſaid to his ſoule;Luk. 12.20. 
                        Eate, drinke, and be merry: yet the ſelfe ſame night it was taken from him. The ſhip would be mended in the hauen, not in the tempeſtuous Sea; the breach would be repayred in the time of peace, not in the skirmiſhes of warre. In time a care would be had of our eſtate for the time to come. The dayes of man are ſhort, and his time vncertaine; that little moment wee haue to prouide for a ſtate of all continuance, and to

gaine eternitie in, is quickly runne ouer before wee be aware.
                     Gods mercy (in giuing vs time and ſpace) paſſeth along 
                           section 5 as a pleaſant-riuer; if we ſtop the courſe thereof, by continuance in ſinne, it will riſe high (as a floud) and turne into Iuſtice, bearing vs downe by force (as a violent ſtreame) and ouerthrow our ſureſt repoſe. Such is here our fraile and brittle eſtate, that when wee ſeeme to ſtand in great ſecuritie, wee then doe dwell in deepeſt danger; and when wee leaſt feare, we ſooneſt fall. Calamitie commeth vpon vs not looked for, ſickneſſe ſodainly inuadeth, and Death (without ranſome) requireth her due; therefore Boaſt not thy ſelfe of to morrow,
                        Prou. 27.1. 
                        for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth. Our continuance here is certaine in vncertaintie: therefore (ſaith one) Let our vncertaine condition worke a certaine carefulneſſe of our eſtate to come. That which once, and neuer but once is done, ſhould be aduiſedly begunne, carefully proſecuted, and moſt ſeriouſly laboured, with all induſtry, vnto the end. Wee ſleepe with our cauſe,
                        
                           Auguſt.
                         
                        and wee riſe with our cauſe (ſaith Auguſtine:) Doe well, and haue well; liue the life of the righteous, and dye the death of the righteous. To him that paſſeth through darke places, one light carryed before him, will doe him more good then many brought after him. When ſleepe is gone from the ſicke mans eyes; when rather extremitie of griefe, then true ſorrow, doth rake out a little ſicke repentance from the moſt careleſſe perſon; when reſt is departed from their toſſed beds, then many can wiſh they had better ſerued God: but theſe things ſhould be conſidered in time; and here is time, therefore take it before thou endureſt a dying life, and a liuing death full of endleſſe woe.
                     O good life (ſaith a holy Father) what a ioy art thou 
                           section 6 in the time of death? Thou makeſt men not aſhamed to liue longer, becauſe they liue honeſtly; nor afraid to dye, departing religiouſly, hauing ſerued a good Lord. But the wicked are aſhamed to ſee him whom they haue

diſhonoured: the one is quit by a ioyfull Proclamation, the other found guilty at the bar of his owne conſcience. What a dangerous courſe is it, neuer to awake Chriſt till the ſhip leake, and be in danger of drowning? neuer to beginne to liue well, vntill wee be a dying? neuer to call to minde that time of all times, before we heare the Trumpet ſounding, the graues opening, the earth flaming, the heauens melting, the Iudgement haſtening, and the Iudge (with his Angels) comming to denounce the laſt ſentence and doome?Pſal. 50.22. 
                        O conſider this you that forget God, leſt hee take you away, and there be none to deliuer you. This preſent life is our market, to make prouiſion for our ſoules againſt the life to come; now is the time of running to get the prize; now is the time to fight to winne the field; now is the time of ſowing, for the plentifull crop of harueſt comming on: If we omit this time, there is no more crowne, no more booty, no other Kingdome, no other prize,Prou. 20.4. no more harueſt to be looked for: for Hee that will not ſow in winter, ſhall beg in Summer.
                     
                     
                        
                           section 7 Marke well (ſaith one) what I ſay, that a man which repenteth not but at his latter end, ſhall be damned? I doe not ſay ſo. What then doe I ſay? He ſhall be ſaued? No. What then doe I ſay? I ſay I know not, I ſay I preſume not, I promiſe not. Wilt thou then deliuer thy ſelfe out of this doubt? Wilt thou eſcape this dangerous poynt? Repent thou then whileſt thou art whole: for if thou repent whileſt thou art in health, whenſoeuer the laſt day of all commeth vpon thee, thou art ſafe, for that thou didſt repent in that time when thou mighteſt yet haue ſinned: But if thou wilt repent when thou canſt ſinne no longer, thou leaueſt not ſinne, but ſinne leaueth thee. If men come without oyle in their Lampes, then is there nothing for them to expect,Mat. 25. but Neſcio vos, I know you not: And when they are knowne, Ite maledicti, Goe you curſed into euerlaſting fire. God hath giuen other things double vnto vs,
                           Chriſoſt. ad pop. Anti. Hom. 10. that if the one be hurt, the other may ſtand vs in ſtead, as eyes, eares, hands, and feet double,

but hee hath giuen vs but one ſoule, which if we deſtroy, what is there in the world, wherby wee may hope for any life? The Sonne of God gaue himſelfe a ranſome for our ſoules, that they might not be accounted vile, but precious in our ſight.
                     
                        All that which thou haſt meanes to doe (ſaith the Preacher)
                              section 8 doe it according to thy power, for in the graue,
                        Eccleſ. 9.10. 
                        whither thou goeſt, there it neyther worke, nor diſcourſe, nor knowledge, nor wiſedome. Many then thinke of death When they cannot liue, they pardon their enemies when they cannot reuenge, they giue away their goods, when they can no longer keepe them, they forgiue their debters when they haue nothing to pay, they leaue their whores when they can no longer keepe them, they deteſt wine when they cannot drinke, and defie the world when they can no longer inhabite it; pride they loath when they are preparing of their winding-ſheete, ſicke they are, but their repentance is ſicker, &c. Death is at our doores, Iudgement ouer our heads, Hell is at hand, all horrible, and yet without horrour. We laugh, we leape, we dance, we drinke, we ſing to the ſound of the Violl vaine delights,Amos 6.5.6. and we inuent to our ſelues Inſtruments of Muſicke, like Dauid; as he to the ſeruice and honour of his God, ſo we to pleaſe our vnſanctified affections and extrauagant luſts. O Lord, ſet thy feare before our face, and ſo ſettle it in our hearts, that we may readily obay thy heauenly call, by flight from ſinne, for feare of Iudgement: Let vs not be like to the vnwiſe Leuite,Iudg. 19.9. who at the end of the day would goe on his iourney, by reaſon whereof hee incurred perill, and was the cauſe of his wiues heauy end: Let vs rather riſe earely, and goe on our way, whiles the light of life doth ſhine, leſt darkneſſe ſurpriſe vs. Old ſores are hardly cured, and hardly ſhall you bring old dogs to lead.Iob 20.11. 
                        An old mans bones (ſaith Zopher to Iob) are filled with the ſinnes of his youth, and continue with him vnto the graue.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. III. Of the hinderances of our Preparation to death in generall, and how carefully they muſt be auoyded.
                     
                        
                           section 1
                        LEt vs now proceede to remoue ſuch impediments (through the helpe of God) as lye in our way to hinder our ſpeedie paſſage, in this our pilgrimage of death, which is (as wee haue heard) the true hauen of life, to all Gods children. Great and manifold are Sathans aſſaults in this our iourney, who ſtill ſheweth himſelfe a profeſſed aduerſarie in all good proceedings: And here he commeth, not himſelfe alone, but with a huge hoaſt and army of enemies, hauing the whole world, our fleſh, and friends, to fight againſt vs: But of theſe things in this place, let it ſuffice to poynt at in generall, vntill wee come to a more particular diſcourſe, as occaſion ſhall be offered. And let vs firſt learne to arme our ſelues againſt theſe our deadly foes, that ſo being harneſſed (as it were) with the armour of proofe, wee may ſtrongly ſtand out, when wee ſhall be aſſailed, neuer yeelding to our foes, but following faſt our Captaine Chriſt, to get the conqueſt in this our fight, which already is begunne, and ſhall moſt aſſuredly be gotten to all the faithfull.
                     
                        
                           section 2 Sathan firſt of all will thus be ready to aſſault vs. And art thou ready to dye O man? Why then behold the ſwarme of thy ſinnes, the number of thy faults, and monſtrous rebellions againſt thy God, both old and new, of age▪ and youth, for which the wrath of God, the graue, and hell are ready to deuoure thee. The Law is thy Iudge, which doth condemne thee, thy God is iuſt and cannot but accurſe thee, his ſentence is paſſed, and will not cleare thee, &c. So that here (without Chriſt) no comfort can be found, hee onely muſt now protect vs, or elſe wee

periſh; his righteouſneſſe muſt be our roabe to hide our raggedneſſe, his merits the onely meanes to cloath our nakedneſſe; &c. Which things wee cannot poſſeſſe without a true and liuely Faith, which is the gift of God: and therefore wee muſt pray to haue it wrought in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, and all good meanes. This then (as we haue heard already) will get vs the victory ouer the Diuell, and all aſſaults. It will oppoſe to this our deadly foe, life for death, holineſſe for ſinne, obedience for the Law; yea, all Chriſts ſatisfactions, to make the whole ſumme. But of this poynt wee haue ſufficiently diſcourſed.
                     Then commeth the World, and will ſet abroach his 
                           section 3 baites: What wilt thou dye O man? I pray thee behold thy goodly buildings and ſtately roomes, thy lands and reuenues, thy rents and treaſures, thy credit, wealth, and fame, thy pleaſures and delights, and all that thy heart deſireth. But alas O World, this thy felicitie is fayned, thy loue is counterfeit, and thy promiſe is deceitfull. Theſe things (I confeſſe) to be good in their kinde, and for my vſe, ſo long as they ſtand with Gods fauour. Kept they may be, ſo that wee looſe not God, who now doth call vs, and therefore may not keepe vs from him. Yet I know (O World) the vanitie of thy pleaſures, the frailty of thy glory, and the fickleneſſe of thy goods, and that all theſe are nothing in reſpect of the riches of heauen and happy life, which after death I am ſure to haue: wherefore I deſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt; in whom indeede are hid all the treaſures of God; who alſo is the keeper of our true life:Phil. 1.23. Col. 3.2. for this our wretched life which now we lead, is no life indeede, but a very death. For, we are dead, and our life is hid with God in Chriſt; wee walke by faith, and not by ſight; yea, ſo long as wee are at home in this body, wee wander and goe aſtray from God our Lord.2 Cor. 5.7. And thou (O World) (which bewitcheſt ſo many to loue this life) what ſhould I gaine, if I ſhould ſerue thee? I am ſure to be a foe to Chriſt who loues thee not, who prayeth

not for thee,Iohn 17.9. whoſe Kingdome is not of thee: and therefore to loue thee is to hate my God, which to doe, is worſe then death. Thy reward (I know) is nothing but nakedneſſe, for naked I came vnto thee, and naked I ſhall goe from thee:Iob 1.21. therefore I am willing to forgoe thee, and deſire to be freed to dwell with Chriſt.
                     
                        
                           section 4 Laſtly, comes the Fleſh (with trembling and quaking:) Why? wilt thou dye O man? ſee here thy friends and thy family, thy Wife and thy Children, thy Father, thy Mother weepe and waile, cry and call vnto thee, and wilt thou thus depart? wilt thou needes goe from them? It is good (no doubt) to tarry ſtill among our friends with Gods good will; and there is nothing (vnder God) but it may be kept, ſo that God (being aboue all things which we haue) be not loſt:Math. 10.37. 
                        For hee that loueth father or Mother, Wife, or Children, &c. better then Chriſt, is not worthy of his preſence. And though my friends lament the loſſe of my life,Pſal. 89.48. yet can they not redeeme it: for what man is hee that liueth and ſhall not ſee death? and ſhall hee deliuer his ſoule from the hand of the graue? No, no, neyther riches nor ſtrength, neyther power nor policie can preuaile in this poynt. Death neyther ſpareth pouerty, nor regardeth wealth, it eſteemes neyther manners, age, nor time, but walketh in the gates of old men, and ſetteth ſnares continually for young men: no worldly practiſe can eſcape the bands of death. It alwayes purſueth vs, and whereſoeuer we goe, it layeth hands vpon vs: And though men labor to liue long, and deſire that they might neuer come to the terme of their dayes; yet indeede it is no other thing to liue, then to make haſte to death. Wherefore men doe walke, whither they would not come, and willingly runne to the end of that courſe which euermore they haue abhorred; for death is the puniſhment of all men, the tribute of all men, the rule of all men, and the receiuer of all men: God hath ſet vs our bounds which wee cannot paſſe.
                     
                        
                           section 5 And as the greene leaues (in a thicke tree) ſome fall,

and ſome grow: ſo is the generation of fleſh and bloud, one comes to an end, and another is borne. Wee came not altogether, neyther muſt wee goe altogether: therefore O Fleſh be content, O my friends be quiet: needes wee muſt depart, though to meete againe wee are full ſure: And in going from you my earthly friends, I ſhall not yet be deſtitute of friends, but make a good exchange; for I goe to the Saints of heauen, to the liuing God, who is Iudge of all; to Ieſus Chriſt my Redeemer,Heb. 12.22.23. to the celeſtiall Ieruſalem, to my abiding Citie, to the company of Angels, to the Congregation of the firſt borne, to the ſpirits of the righteous, and to ioyes vnſpeakable beyond all mans conceit. Such be the comforts, the rewards, heritages, and exceeding priuiledges that God hath (before all worlds) prepared and alwayes had in ſtore for his elect. And therefore ſtill I deſire to be freed from the fleſh, to liue with Chriſt; Wee haue here no continuing Citie,
                        Heb. 13.13.14. 
                        wee looke for one of God: And I know that ſo long as I am in the fleſh I cannot pleaſe God, and that if once this earthly houſe of this tabernacle were deſtroyed, I ſhall haue a building giuen me of God, a houſe not made with hands,
                        2 Cor. 5.1. 
                        but euerlaſting with God in the heauens.
                     
                     Not to liue (ſaid one) but to paſſe the life well, is life 
                           section 6 indeede. Our life is very ſhort, for all good things, yet long enough, and too long (may we thinke it) in regard of our miſeries. A dangerous ſtraite, in which the leſſe time thou haſt to paſſe, the more perill and danger thou haſt in the paſſage: But this is a miſerie of miſeries (that being in ſuch a miſerable caſe) we liue like men in a phrenſie, not knowing our miſery. Heraclitus and Democritus could better diſcerne this poynt then many Chriſtians, of whom it is reported that the one paſt his life in laughing, and the other alwayes in weeping: ſeeing (as it ſeemeth) that all our life is nothing elſe but ridiculous vanitie and lamentable miſery. Moreouer, if this life be a vale of teares, a priſon of guilty perſons, and a baniſhment of them that be condemned, how canſt thou place ſuch great pompe

and pride, ſuch gay ornaments, and ſtately furniture of houſes and families, in ſuch a wretched place? how canſt thou take here thy paſtimes and pleaſures? how canſt thou delight thy ſelfe in feaſting and banketting? how canſt thou deſire ſo greedily to gather the prouiſion of this world, and be ſo forgetfull for the life to come? As though thou wert onely borne to liue alwayes here with bruite beaſts, and hadſt no portion with the Angels in heauen. Such wretchedneſſe ſheweth of what a miſerable ſtocke thou commeſt, if nothing can perſwade thee to behold this thy great and palpable blindneſſe.
                     
                        
                           section 7 Wee maruell much at the rude and ignorant Indians, who (for glaſſes and trifles) are ſaid to part from their pureſt gold: but wee neuer thinke of our owne folly, who forgoe the treaſures of heauen for very bables, and ſell our birth-right and bleſſing for Eſaus broath.Heb. 12.16. Men looke vnto pleaſures as they are comming to them, & not as they are going from them, when they are wont to leaue trouble and vexation behinde: for the ſting of the Scorpion is in his tayle. Wee ſell our hearts to the world for very chaffe, and God offers vs millions for them; nay (to haue our cuſtome) hee giues vs an aſſay of merchandiſe, peace of conſcience, and ioy of the holy Ghoſt. Who would not traffique with ſo good a Chapman? that meanes no other but to doe vs good indeed, and will giue vs heauen, when we haue giuen him our hearts who is in heauen. As all the waters of the Riuer runne into the Sea, ſo all worldly delights finiſh their courſe in the ſalt brine ſea of ſorrowes. The peaceable dayes of the wicked, their immunitie from the rod, their dancing to the Inſtruments of Muſicke, haue their preſent period, and in a moment they goe downe to hell.Iob 21. & 12.13 Such luſty-guts (in the prime of their pride, and raging madneſſe) are ſure of a Iudgement. The gurmandizing Epicure holloweth not ſo loud (whilſt hee walloweth in his ſenſuall life, as the Swine in their ſtyes) but hee ſhall howle as much when hee is in hell.1 Sam. 16.23. It was but a dumpiſh delight that Saul taſted (in his

mad melancholy moode) in the ſweet notes of Dauid, ſung vpon the harpe.
                     We muſt miſtruſt worldly benefits, and baits couering 
                           section 8 the hooke for the fiſh; we muſt not feede ſo hungerly on then, their pleaſings are leaſings, and their friendſhips fallacies; they are as falſe witneſſes againſt thy ſoule, ſuch as Iezabell ſuborned to kil innocent Naboth: After the manner of Egyptian theeues, they imbrace vs, that they may ſlay vs: They are as goblets of gold, ſugered with poyſon. This deceiptful Dalilah of delights, ſpeaketh thee faire, but in the end ſhe will bereaue thee of thy ſtrength, of thy ſight, yea, of thy ſelfe. Theſe waſpes flye about thy eares, and make thee muſicke, but euermore they ſting ere they part. Sorrow and repentance is the beſt end of pleaſure, paine is yet worſe, but the worſt of all is deſpaire. How much better is it for thee to want a little hony, then to be ſwolne vp with a venemous ſting? Wee muſt vſe them without truſt, and want them without griefe, ſtill thinking while we haue them, that we poſſeſſe a benefit with a charge. If croſſes once befall vs, the comfort of riches flie from vs (like vermine from a houſe on fire) leauing vs to our ruine. But he that hath placed his refuge aboue, is ſure that the ground of his comfort cannot be matched with any earthly ſorrow; cannot be moued with any worldly thought, but is infinitely aboue all hazards. Let the world toſſe and tumble how it liſt (as euer it doth) the reſt of Gods children is pitched aloft, aboue the ſpheare of changable mortalitie? O the broken reede of humane confidence! who euer truſted in friends that euer could truſt to himſelfe? who was euer more diſcontented then the wealthy? Friends may be falſe, wealth cannot but be deceitfull: truſt thou therefore to that (which if thou wouldeſt) cannot faile thee.
                     The Elephant (being courſed) caſteth her precious tooth 
                           section 9 and ſo eſcapeth; ſo muſt we forſake the fleſh and deareſt friends, the world & greateſt pleaſures, to be with Chriſt. If men forſake their own will, & ſubmit themſelues to Gods,

what can be hard? But if we follow our owne appetites, and delicate niceneſſe (reiecting Gods pleaſure) what can be eaſie? Therefore not ours, but thy will be done. God hath a care ouer vs, our life is in his hand, yet ſcarce the hundreth man hath this faſtned in his heart; for euery one ſearcheth a way and meanes to ſaue his life, as though there were no power, and care in God: And yet in his hands are the iſſues of death: Death ſeemeth to conſume all things, but God deliuereth out of that deuouring gulfe, whom he pleaſeth, therefore let vs leaue it at his pleaſure, either to deliuer vs from preſent danger, or to take vs to a better life.
                     A wiſe man, ought alwaies to keepe himſelfe from ſorrow 
                           section 11 and inordinate care, for this worldly and tranſitory life, and the things thereof. Not to doe (as the Doue) which breeding her Pidgeons about the houſe, maketh them familiar with the ſame: And albeit they are monthly taken from her and killed, yet ſhe returneth to her old neſt, and breedeth young againe. Worldly fauours, honours, temporall goods, &c. are but as bals of ſnow, which by the beames of the Sunne diſſolue, and come to nothing. What coſt doe wee beſtow vpon the haires of our head and beard? which when the Barber once clippeth off, are deſpiſed and ſwept away. A man ſhould neuer truſt this fooliſh life, it is but as a fire kindled on the coales, which conſuming it ſelfe giueth heate to others. God hath made the beaſts with their faces towards the earth, thither they looke, for from thence they haue their life, and reliefe; but man is erected with two ſtandards with his head, face, and breaſt, to looke to heauen: Let not our hearts therefore differ from our faces; haue not thy face aboue and thy heart below, but lift vp thy heart (as thou profeſſeſt) leſt thou lie to the Church before God and his Angels.
                     
                        
                           section 12 The pouertie of a Chriſtian, doth forerunne the riches which he hath in heauen: The loue of the world, is an exemption from the life of God; the allurements thereof are like the crying of a Lapwing, that traineth vs the

furtheſt from that we ſeeke. The pompe of the world, is like a blazing Starre, that dreadeth the minde by preſaging ruine; and the temptations to pleaſure, are like canded worm-wood that cooſen the taſte, and kill the ſtomacke. To be vnknowne in the world, we neede not care, ſo be it we be in credit with God, for hee that is great with God, ſhall haue quietneſſe in earth, and bleſſedneſſe in heauen. When it ceaſed to be with Sara (ſaith one) after the manner of the world, ſhe conceiued Iſaac the Sonne of promiſe,Gen. 18.11 & 21.2. her exceeding ioy: ſo when our worldly deſires once wither, heauenly will enſue. Let vs therefore care little for the world, that careth ſo little for vs. Let vs croſſe ſaile, and turne another way vnto our long home, and looked-for abode: from a life ſubiect vnto death, to a deathleſſe life, euen as neare as wee can with a ſtill and peaceable paſſage.
                     Am I contemned of the world, it is inough for me that 
                           section 13 I am honoured of God; of both I cannot: the world would loue me more, if I were leſſe friends with God: He is vnworthy of Gods fauour that cannot thinke it happineſſe enough, without the worlds. The diuell playeth the Hoſt (in this world) and will ſerue our turne, with any delights that fleſh deſireth, but he noteth all in a booke, and at the day of reckoning (which is our death) it will be to our coſt, if we take not heede in time. This is the trinitie that wicked men (ſaith one) doe worſhip, the Diuell, the world and the fleſh, inſtead of the Father, Sonne, and holy ghoſt. The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, are the idols that the world doe make their Gods.1 Ioh. 2.16. But the minutes that hackney at the heeles of time, runne not ſo faſt away as doth this world with his pleaſures, and fleſhly ioyes. Let vs therefore alwaies deteſt the eye-pleaſing baits of carnall deſires, and wholly delight our ſelues with heauenly ioyes. He which once haue drunke of the floods of Paradiſe (one drop whereof quencheth the thirſt ſooner then the ocean Sea) ſhall quickly haue the deſires of this world, and fleſhly luſts, extinguiſhed in him.

Eph. 2.2. & 6.12 wherein hee ruleth (in the iuſtice of God) ouer the children of diſobedience, blinding the eies of Infidels, with a falſe glory & gliſtring ſhewes thereof, that they ſhould not beleeue the truth of Gods word; for their further aſſurance of that incomparable glory & bleſſed ſtate to come; it is expedient more fully to diſcloſe this dangerous place, wherein Sathan pitcheth his camp againſt Gods elect.Num 20.17.18 Deut. 8.15. & 32.10. Exo. 14.15.16. And ſo much the rather becauſe it is the paſſage of their pilgrimage, which poſſibly they cannot ſhun. Iſrael muſt needs go thorow Edom where cruell Eſau dwels; and paſſe along this dangerous wilderneſſe, full of ſauage beaſts, fiery Serpents, Tygers, and Scorpions: Yet goe hee muſt, thorow the red ſea of all fearefull hazards and temptations (that ſpirituall Tyrant Pharo following him faſt to the heeles, with all poſſible violence) before they can arriue at the heauenly hauen and bleſſed land of reſt.
                     
                        
                           section 2 This world is a Sea of ſorrow, and our life reſembleth the new ſailing Ship, not acquainted with the water, but fleeting to the bottomeleſſe ſwallow of tempeſtuous waues, alwaies threatning the ſinking of our life. It is as a courſe of a moſt vehement running ſtreame, but yet not appearing to haue any perill of drowning to him that paſſeth: It is ſhallow by the ſides, but deepe and very dangerous in the midſt, aboue, it runneth very quietly, couering the water with great riches, and wares of an inualuable price, by meanes whereof it deceiueth couetous men, that run and enter it. Some wade ſhallow, wetting onely their feet, and take a few; others goe vp to the knees, and catch for more:

a third ſort (with an inſatiable deſire) doe plunge their whole body into the water; others truſting to ſwim, ſo wreſtle with the violent ſtreames,Mat. 6.11. and finding it deepe (being wearied) ſinke to the bottome, which is moſt ſwift and raging. We daily pray that God would not lead vs into temptation, yet ſtill we feede our couetous humor, which drowneth vs therin. And the Diuel doth daily pitch his nets to compaſſe vs therewith, to hale vs into hell, & couetouſnes cauſeth vs to ſtumble and tumble thereinto. It ingendereth ſuch noyſome luſts that drowne men in perdition.1 Tim. 6.9.10 It is Sathans forge and ſtithie (ſaith one) where he faſhioneth and frameth a thouſand chaines of impieties,
                           Diogines in Plut. Apoth.
                         to pull men into hell, and a thouſand fiery darts to wound mens ſoules with all ſorts of vices, it is the metropolitane citie of all corruption and ſinne.

It lurketh in the raynes, and is tyed vnto the bowels, neither can it be pulled vp by any ſtrength of men. The greateſt rauening beaſts, are ſometime ſatiſfied, purſes and coffers may be filled, but an inſatiable minde is a bottomleſſe pit, and a gulfe deuouring all, yet neuer repleniſhed. It reſembleth a ſpring, whoſe riuer is ſmall, yet (by receiuing other brookes and ſtreames) groweth ſtrong and violent. Such are like men in a dropſie,

                         but (Lady couetouſneſſe) layeth vp the Keyes, and locketh from him the vſe of all; like Horſes and Mules going laden with the gold and ſiluer of others, eate nothing but hay themſelues:

ſuch a mans wealth is but as a faire Tapeſtrie, that couereth foule and broken wals: The higher ſuch a man clymeth (ſaith Ambroſe) and the higher he goeth the greater is his fall:
                           Auguſt.
                         Before he gaineth he hath loſt himſelfe (ſaith Auguſtine.) Such beaſts are theſe miſers that they know not this life, yet can they not deny but they muſt die. What pleaſure therefore can they take in cutting the wood, and making the faggots, wherewith in hell (without repentance) they ſhall be burnt for euer. The cuſtomers of this world (ſaith one) who haue got their wealth with fraud and deceipt: they ſleepe like the Nightingale with a pricke againſt their breaſt; ſo doe ſuch ſlumber with a pricking conſcience, and liue in horrour of Death.
                     
                        
                           section 4 God therefore in his prouidence and wiſedome, hath fraught this life with ſo manifold miſeries, to make them as medicinable puniſhments for our fleſhly deſires; he hath laid ſuch bitter wormewood on the breaſts of this flattering world, to waine vs from it; hee hath made it loathſome to his children, that they ſhould not loue it, but willingly forſake it, and ſigh for the bleſſed life to come: For if we be ſo vnwilling to forſake this life, ſo irkſome; if wee be euer whimpring and whining, for the fruits and fleſhpots of this ſlauiſh Egypt,Exod. 16.3. what would wee doe if all our life were ſweet? what would we doe if it were wholy to our taſt and tallage? who would then contemne it for Gods cauſe? who would exchange it for heauen it ſelfe? When Iacob was haſting into his owne country, Laban (in his great haſt purſuing him) ſaid, why didſt thou not tell mee of thy departing,
                        Gen. 31.27. 
                        that I might haue let thee goe with mirth and melodie? when his meaning was to haue kept him ſtill in drudgerie. But as Iacob did well (ſeeing Labans countenance ſet againſt him;) ſo ſhould Chriſtians (finding the world to frowne vpon them) be ready to packe from the world,Gen. 19.26. it being no fit place for them to tarry in. Lots wife (ſetting her minde vpon her ſubſtance in Sodome and other pleaſures there) ſhee looked backward, but

neuer looked forward againe: She is turned into a Piller of Salt: a Piller, and ſo ſtandeth for an example; of Salt, and ſo ſhould ſeaſon our vnſauorie deſires of this world and worldly things.
                     Small cauſe had the Iſralites to care to continue among 
                           section 5 the taſk-maiſters of Aegipt;Exod. 1.11.14. no more haue Chriſtians to dwell in this world, as in a wildernes, among many wolfes. Surely this barren light land wherein wee liue (after all our drugery & exceſſiue paines) yeeldeth nothing elſe but a crop of cares, troubles, feares, & vexations of minde. How acceptable therefore may death be, when in dying we ſleepe, & in ſleeping we reſt from all the trauels of this toyleſome life? Loue the world ſaith one, & it will deuoure thee, for it knoweth better how to ſwallow vp her louers, then to ſupport them. There is no truſting to this worlds ſecurity, for in one moment the ſea ouerwhelmes the ſame nauies which a little before plaied & ſported vpon it. Now, that this world is a ſea, the ſmall number of ſafe paſſingers, & the great company of ſuch as periſh therein doth proue.
                     Here we are placed (as it were) betweene heauen & hell,
                           section 6 & our danger is ſo much the greater, by how much it is eaſier, to deſend downeward then to aſpire & clyme vpward; Facilis diſcenſus Auerni, &c.
                        
                           d. 6 Learne not to loue the world, that thou maieſt learne to imbrace thy God, turne away from it, that thou maieſt turne to him. Powre out the dreggs, that thou maieſt be filled with pure wine, thou art to be fild with good, powre out the euill, doſt thou thinke that God will fil thee with hony, if thou beeſt full of gall? Our loue muſt be as a iuſt ballance, affording euery man his owne; but the weights of worldly luſts are vnequall, valewing earthly things to be moſt pretious,Phil. 3.8. Luk. 16.15. Oſe 1.12. whereas with the chriſtian, they ſhould be eſtemed as dung. Theſe make that to be of weight & great with man, which is moſt vile and abhominable in Gods account. Such are the deceitfull ſcoales of curſed Canaan:Leuit. 25.15. Amongſt the Iewes for that their contracts and bargaines had by

a preſcript law, a day of determining and of being voide, therefore, the ſhorter the time was, the leſſe and ſlight was the price and valuation of the thing. And therefore how much more vile and of leſſe account ſhould all theſe momentanie and earthly things be reputed, ſubiect to ſuch loſſe, which though they were not, yet Death it ſelfe diſpatcheth vs of all?
                     
                        
                           section 7 They which runne in a race, looke what ground they haue rid behind, and how farre they haue to the goale before. And they which looked for the yeare of Iubilee, knew how long they might poſſeſſe their bargaines: But there is no mortall man that can be aſſured to liue a day. Indeede we run, yet hauing deaths ſhackles on our legs, yea, carrying him about in our whole bodies and liues. The glory of this world (being grounded vpon the life of man,
                           Pindarus.
                         as the ſubiect and foundation) can no longer endure then the ſubſtance it ſelfe. Now if the life be no more but a dreame of a ſhadow, what muſt we thinke of the glory of this world, which is ſhorter of continuance then mans life? What account would one make of a ſtately building, if in caſe it ſhould ſtand vpon a falſe foundation? What reckoning would one make of an image of waxe very curiouſly wrought, in caſe it ſhould be ſet againſt the Sunne, where (preſently being molten) it ſhould looſe both forme and faſhion? Why doe we make ſo little account of the beautie of a flower, but becauſe it beginneth to fade ſo ſoone as it flouriſheth; for being nipt from the ſtalke, it preſently looſeth the pleaſant gloſſe and hew. And albeit glory doe continue after the end of our life, yet what ſhall it auaile thee man, that hath no ſence? What profiteth it Homer, that now thou praiſe his Iliads?
                           Ierom.
                         euen as Ierome ſpeaketh of Ariſtotle, that he was praiſed in the world where he was not, and condemned in hell where hee was indeede. Therefore well ſaid Euripides,

                        that men fall into a frenzie to vſe pride after Death.
                     
                     
                        
                           section 8 The tempter (ſaith Ambroſe) ſhewed the glory of the world in the twinckling of an eye, which likewiſe ſhall vaniſh in

a moment; like Nabuchadnezzers Image,Dan. 2.33.34. 
                        that had ahead of gold, breſts and armes of ſiluer, &c. and yet one daſh (with a ſtone, out of the rocke) brought all to ruine. All worldly glory is no more ſure and certaine, then calmeneſſe in the Sea, which is ſtill ſubiect to a ſtorme. O world (ſaith one) moſt vnworthy to be affected! where are the riches that pouerty hath not decayed? where is the beauty that age hath not withered? where is the ſtrength that ſickeneſſe hath not weakened? where is the pompe that time hath not waſted? I ſay not of men, but of Cities and Empires themſelues? Thoſe that ſo eagerly ſeeke after the things of this world, and ſo ſeldome and ſleightly after heauen and heauenly things, are not vnfitly reſembled to children, that eſteeme more of Apples and Nuts then the aſſurance of rents and reuenues. And indeede moſt men (and thoſe the wiſeſt in the world) doe not ſo much as vnderſtand the Kingdome of heauen and the righteouſneſſe thereof, ſo farre are they from ſeeking it, rather then the riches of the world. Such men (as they ſay) ſet the Cart before the Horſe, firſt ſeeking things for the body before they take any care for the ſoule.Luke 16.8. Theſe men yet are wiſer in their generation, then the children of the Kingdome, and haue eyes as broad as the Moone in her full; but ſuch aduantage hath the Owle of a man, whoſe ſight is better at midnight then mans. Such Owle-faces are better ſighted then the children of light. In wily craftineſſe the rudeſt Ruſticke eaſily circumuenteth the cunningſt Chriſtian: yet hee is but an Aſſe in the ſhape of a man, who hath not learned Chriſt;Ier. 8.8. and Ieremy wondreth how hee ſhould be a wiſe man that is not a godly man. Theſe doe not ſo much as wet their lips at the wellſpring of wiſedome, and hauing not ſo much as a ſmacke of Gods Word, how ſhould they not but be fooles? Such are fooles in graine, and a burthen to the earth, ſetting vp mans folly as a monarchy in the world, diſplaying (as with a banner) their owne worldly fooleries.
                     
                        
                        
                           section 9 But ſith our life dependeth not vpon the world, or the goods thereof, but vpon God alone: let vs put our truſt not on our goods but vpon God, on whoſe pleaſure our goods depend; who alſo hath promiſed neuer to forſake any faithfull men, that put their truſt in him. Wee may not be as ſawcy Children, who when they know their Father will not pleaſe them in their fooliſh appetites, will prouide for themſelues: but our duety is to be pleaſed with our daily bread.Mat. 6.7. Many that make this prayer to God, would be very loath hee ſhould take them at their word, and daily giue them bread but for a day at once: yet ſuch men (in vſing this prayer) doe nothing elſe but ſcorne their prouident God; but let good Chriſtians learne to caſt their care on God, that they may the better moderate their deſires.
                     
                        
                           section 10
                        Learne not ſo much (ſaith Plato) to increaſe thy poſſeſſions, as to diminiſh thy luſts: for the high-way to be rich, is to be poore in coueting: and hee is the richeſt that coueteth the leaſt, and is content with a little. Now the way to cure this Feuer (which cauſeth ſuch a thirſt of the world and worldly things) is not to giue vs drinke, and fill of our deſires, (which increaſeth the diſeaſe) but by diminiſhing the immoderate loue and liking of the ſame. Now one ſpeciall meanes hereunto is to truſt in God, ſince the roote of this ſinne is diſtruſt in God. Before the creation of man, the world was made and repleniſht with all things requiſite for his vſe, and before the ſoule the body was created to receiue it: Sith then God prouided for man before his creation, and nouriſhed the body in the wombe before it was borne, and giueth care to the mother of ſuſtayning and cloathing it before the birth; ſhall wee call into queſtion his fatherly care ouer vs? Let not theſe things therefore hinder vs in the high-way to heauen; but caſting all our care vpon God, let vs be packing on our iourney. Let the meſſengers of death be welcome vnto vs, and Death himſelfe be imbraced when God doth ſend it: For though they depriue vs of the world (with his wealth and

pleaſures,) yet they put vs in poſſeſſion of heauen itſelfe, and happy treaſures. And for theſe tranſitory things (which are but as vapours and exhalations of the world,) A godly man (ſaith Auguſtine) neuer ſo fully enioyeth his deſire, as when hee is willing nothing at all to deſire them.
                        
                           Auguſt.
                         Contentment (ſaith one) conſiſteth not in much, yet he hath much that hath it; and this is ſoone obtayned of God in a low eſtate. Nature (wee ſay) is content with a little, and onely contentation miniſtreth reſt and peace vnto our mindes. The Sea of this world (ſaith a holy Father) freezing vnto vs, it hardeneth,Mat. 14 29. that wee may ſafely walke vpon it, as Peter on the water.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. Of the great griefe of forſaking our wealth and worldly eſtate, and leauing of our manifold friends and acquaintance in the world: with the remedies thereof.
                     
                        FEarefull is the conſideration to fleſh and bloud 
                           section 1 (not indued with the comforts of Gods holy Spirit) to thinke of our poore and naked eſtate, at our latter end; Death waiting vpon vs, not onely to depriue vs of our life and beeing, but of all ſuch comfortable meanes and helpes which formerly wee enioyed: taking from vs our houſes, goods, and friends; which Iob beganne to feele and confeſſe in his tryals with lowd exclamation;Iob 1.21. 
                        Naked I came into the world, and naked ſhall I returne. God indeede made all theſe things for man; yea, the whole world it ſelfe, of which hee tooke poſſeſſion; yet forgetting his homage to God, and chiefe-rent of obedience, hee forfaited all againe into his hands, and from whence hee came, thither ſent he him againe, giuing him iuſt as much with him, as hee brought at firſt; Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt diſſolue.
                        Gen. 3.19. And indeede this prouiſion is ſufficient enough for the place whither hee goeth. For what great matters ſhould

we looke for in the graue, where rottenneſſe is our father, and wormes are our mother?Iob 17.14. When our breath once vaniſheth, and we ſhall be turned out of the houſe-roomes of this world, repayring to our doomes-day houſe, where the wormes (the dead mens Lawyers) ſhall take their fees out of vs their graue-clyents, and our bodies with our bowels ſhall be their bread to ſatiate their hunger. Then happy (I ſay) are thoſe that by the wings of a liuely faith, haue their ſoules flying vp to the heauenly habitations.
                     
                        
                           section 2 Hither we came as Iacob to Laban; onely by Gods prouidence,Gen 28.20.21. wee are that wee are. If God will giue vs food to eate, and cloathes to put on, God ſhall be our God. Theſe heards and droues about vs,Gen. 33.11. they are from the mercy of God; not plants growing in our owne ſoyle; not vapours that did ariſe from vs, but of the nature of influences from heauen are come vpon vs. Euery one ſueth to God in forma pauperis: for things neceſſary wee are poore Publicanes, (receiuers onely) God is the giuer of all. Wee cannot call any thing ours but Time; While we haue time let vs doe good. Nay, this time it ſelfe is not in our hands, but in the Lords. All theſe temporall things come from the great ſtore-houſe of heauen. We may not ſay (as the Tempter did) All theſe are mine:Mat. 4. & Luke 4.6. no, all is Gods, who is the beſt Land-lord. Hee requires no more but our acknowledgement of his bleſſings, with thankefulneſſe in our obedience. Wee may haue them, wee muſt not be had of them: wee haue had them to liue, the end ceaſing, the meanes alſo ceaſe concurring to the end. Wee muſt not make Idols of them,Exod. 32.14. as the Egyptians did of their treaſure.
                     
                        
                           section 3 Is it poſſible to forget whither wee are going? Where ſhould the members be, but where the head raigneth? where ſhould the heart be,Mat. 6.21. but where our heauenly treaſure is placed? Chriſt, who is our treaſure is in heauen, whither firſt our affections muſt aſcend, and then we follow after.Prou. 27.34. 
                        Riches (ſaith the Wiſe-man) helpe not in the time

of neede, they take them to their wings and flye away: they are but ſtraw and ſtabble, no ſure foundation to build on. For all worldly goods are ebbing and flowing (like the Sea,) and wee doe not poſſeſſe them (as wee ought) vnleſſe at all times we be ready and willing (when God ſeeth it good) to forgoe and leaue them. Let vs conſider that when we dye, wee depart from the world, and therefore worldly affections ſhould now depart from vs. Let vs betake our ſelues wholy to a better habitation, better ſocieties, to better ioyes, and ſo deſire chearefully to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt. God many times puniſheth our ouerlouing of earthly things with their loſſe, or great hinderance; becauſe he thinkes them vnworthy riuals to himſelfe, who challengeth all height of loue, as his onely right. So that the way to looſe them, is to loue them much; and the largeneſſe of affection maketh an open way to diſſipation. The fayrer and higher in the world our eſtate ſhall be, the fayrer marke hath miſchiefe giuen vnto it, and (which is worſe) that which maketh vs ſo eaſie to hit, maketh our wound more deepe and grieuous.
                     Neyther muſt wee thinke that wee hold any thing of 
                           section 4 right, which wee enioy of Gods free mercy and grace: neyther in our conceit, to binde the Lord (at his owne coſt and charges, as it were, by Obligation) to finde vs. And notwithſtanding wee be but beggars (as at whoſe gate of mercy wee receiue all our maintenance,) yet to make a rent-charge of all that which he giueth of his free liberalitie. Thus proud men many times make a breach into the Lords poſſeſſion, and prouoke him (to proue to their faces) that all that they haue is but lent them, and borrowed. Let vs therefore vpon euery blow (when the Lord ſhall ſtrike vs) be ready to receiue it, and to yeeld vp our bands vnto him, the condition whereof is, that wee be ready to remoue when hee will haue vs: knowing that Gods prouidence alwayes forceth vs to the beſt, and as the moſt may make for the haſtning of our ſoules

to our euerlaſting inheritance. Let vs learne then not to reckon with our hoſt; and that wee hold our liues, and all wee haue, not in Fee-ſimple, but as Tenants at will, that ſo from day to day, wee may reſigne to God the ſoueraigntie of reuoking vs, at his pleaſure. Thus when wee ſee our ſelues ſhut vp, and finde that wee be entertayned in this life (as Iourney-men for the preſent day) not knowing what will become of vs to morrow; wee ſhall better deſire to take our reſt in the boſome of Gods prouidence, and to ſtrike our ſayles the lower, when the Lord proclaymeth warre with our ſecure eſtate, and learne to cut our proſperitie by the patterne of humilitie; that when wee are well, to looke for worſe; that ſo in abounding we may ſee our wants, in health our ſickneſſe, and ſtill to ſtand in doubt, that theſe outward things may be holden with one hand, and loſt with another.
                     
                        
                           section 5 A worldly mans body ſhall dye but once, but his heart ſhall dye as often as he ſhall remember thoſe things whereon hee ſets his affections and loue; for as much as death ſhall put the knife betweene him and all things hee loued. The deeper roote the tooth hath in the iaw, the greater paine there is in plucking it out: So the more the heart is ſet vpon the things of this life, the greater griefe will it be to depart from them all. The Diuell had ſpoyled that holy man Iob of all manner of things ſaue onely of his life,Iob 2.4. and it ſeemed to him that all the reſt were of ſmall account in compariſon of the loſſe thereof. So that the thing that naturally is loued, is let goe & loſt with greateſt griefe of heart. Earthly things in themſelues (without Gods bleſſing in the vſe) are like alluring ſtrumpets, catching many (in their ſnares of beauty) to luſt after them, yet depriuing ſuch as inioy them of all vertue and happineſſe. They are like vnto ſweet wines of artificiall Nectar, alluring a man to exceſſiue drinking, yet withall taking man from himſelfe, in making him ſenſleſſe. They trouble the minde, and repleniſh the heart with paſſions. When wicked men will vſe their riches, they pollute themſelues

with pleaſures and pride: when they keepe them,
                           Socrates.
                         care conſumeth them, and eateth out their hearts: when they labour to get them, they grow more wretched and miſerable. They are like to wilde beaſts, which a man can hardly take, and when he hath taken them, muſt take great heede they doe no hurt. Vaine confidence in wealth,
                           Chriſoſt.
                         becomes not onely a poyſon to Humilitie, Modeſtie and Faith, but quite and cleane transformes them into Pride, Arrogancie and Infidelitie. Such goods are as plenty of Sugar & fruit (in the liberty of children,) as pleaſant wine to a drunkard, and as a ſword in a mad naked mans hand, more ready to hurt them then to doe them good. All immoderations are enemies to health (ſo ſaid skilfull Hipocrates.) Hee that deſires, wants as much as hee that hath nothing. The drunken man is as thirſtie as the ſweating traueller. It is true of riches and all outward bleſſings that we ſay of Fire and Water, They are good ſeruants, but ill maſters: Make them therefore thy ſlaues, and they ſhall be good in vſe; good to thy ſelfe, and good to others by thee; But if they be thy maſters, thou haſt condemned thy ſelfe to thy owne Gally-ſlaues: Now if a ſeruant rule, he proues a Tyrant.
                     If thou ſerueſt God for goods and greedineſſe of worldly 
                           section 6 gaine (as Iudas did his Maſter,) thou maiſt ſoone proue a looſer of a happy eſtate, and ſtrangle thy Soule. Wherefore let vs vſe our riches as our rayment: ſuch as are fit, are better then thoſe that are too long. For couetouſneſſe groweth with riches, as the Iuy with the Oake. Our hutches may be filled, but not our hearts: and though wee here looſe all our goods, yet are wee ſcarce depriued of a farthing: And in another life we haue not onely Kingdomes and Empires, but God himſelfe, and euerlaſting goods, in compariſon whereof all the pomp, mirth, cheare, honour, dignities, and preferments of the world, are not to be eſteemed as caſting Compters towards the fineſt Coyne, and vileſt droſſe to the pureſt plates of gold and precious ſtone. Wee may lend our ſelues to the things of

the world, but not giue our ſelues vnto them. Neyther is any thing poſſeſſed (as it ought) except wee be ready at all times to looſe it.

                         Wee muſt remember alwayes that they are tranſitory things, which may be loſt and forgone when time requireth. Theſe earthly things are good, but woe be to thee (if for the loue of the creature) thou forſakeſt thy creator. If we loue not any thing that ſeemeth not good vnto vs, then let vs be aſhamed ſo to ſticke to them, and not to the loue of him that hath made them good. O Lord (ſaith Auguſtine) hee loueth thee too little that loueth any thing with thee,
                        
                           Aug. in ſer. quodam.
                         
                        and loueth it not for thee. God therefore is to be loued aboue all things, and all things for him. He requires all thy loue that made thee wholy: and maruell not that hee will haue thy whole heart, being ſufficient to fill thy heart. O Lord thou haſt made all things to ſerue man, that man alone might ſerue thee; and that man might be wholy thine, thou haſt made all the creatures his.
                     God hath created all outward things for the body, and 
                           section 7 the body for the ſoule, and both body and ſoule for himſelfe,

                         that man might onely obay him, and onely loue him, enioying God for his onely ſolace, and all inferiour things for his ſeruice. That was neuer throughly good that maybe loſt. My true riches will not leeſe mee, though I forgoe all to my skinne. For if hee be rich that hath ſome thing, how rich is hee that is the maker and owner of all things, whom I enioy? So long as God fauours mee, I ſhall haue liberty in priſon, home in baniſhment, honour in contempt, in loſſe wealth, health in infirmitie, life in death, heauen in hell, and in all theſe happineſſe and reſt. If the fire commonly flame according to the quantitie of fuell heaped vpon the ſame: great then is the fire of Gods loue to the faithfull; who in ſtead of fire (to inflame it) hath as many benefits for man, as hee hath Creatures. All things loue him, that loueth God;Rom. 8.28. for to thoſe that loue God all things worke for their good. Good men therefore ſo vſe the

world, and the things thereof, that they may enioy God:
                           Aug. de ciuit. lib. 15. And the wicked ſo vſe God, as that they may inioy the world.

                           section 8 things beſides him, which we loue yet for his ſake; how much then a greater ſinne is it, when wee ſhall loue our goods, and friends, not for Gods ſake, but euen in ſpight of God, in that we loue them more then God, that calleth vs from them?Luk. 14.10. ſuch Chriſt pronounceth not worthy of his glory. Therefore happy is hee (O Lord) which loueth thee, and his friends in thee, and his enemies for thee; for he can neuer be deſtitute of friends who inioyeth God, which is neuer loſt, and eſteemes all as friends. Gods children and choſen can neuer be poore, that are ioyned to ſo rich and glorious a head, euen Ieſus Chriſt, the Lord Treaſurer of heauen;Col. 3.9. in whom all the riches of Gods wiſedome, mercy, goodneſſe, &c. are hid, and god-head it ſelfe doth corporally dwell. But (alas) thou wilt ſay it is hard to forgoe our ſweet children, and deare wiues, our truſty and beſt beloued friends, our paſtures and tillage, our grounds and ſumptuous buildings, our mannor-houſes, rents and reuenewes, our great treaſures and Iewels, and other worldly wealth:Phil. 3.8. And what of all this to him to whom all things are counted loſſe, and eſteemed as dung, in regard of Chriſt? And haue not the true ſouldiers of Chriſt learned long agoe to deſpiſe all theſe aſſaults; whoſe ſoules ſtill watch in the ward and tower of this body, expecting euery moment to heare the ſound of the trumpet, to follow their Captaine Chriſt? Therefore they vſe this body,2 Cor. 5.1. not as a home or ſtrong hold, but as a Tabernacle and pitched tent, for a time to ſerue their turne in this field of their warfare: They hoord not their treaſures here, but are content with their daily pay, alwayes watching in the campe, harneſſed for the fight. The ſouldiers of the world lie ſleeping and ſnorting: Chriſts ſouldiers are alwayes watching and waiting for his comming. If we loue our friends too much,

and not God aboue all things, then hath our ſorrow no meaſure as it ought.
                     
                        
                           section 9 He cannot be ſaid to flit, that neuer changeth his hoſt: God alone is as a thouſand companions, hee alone is a world of friends; and though we depart from our friends here, we goe to more better and more louing: As Iacob ſaid (when hee ſhould die) I ſhall be gathered to my people;Gen. 49.29. hereby declaring that death is a paſſage to many more folkes, and greater friends then we leaue behinde. There is God our Father, his Sonne our brother, his heauen our inheritance, and all his Angels and Saints as our brethren, ſiſters, and kinsfolkes; with whom we ſhall inioy eternall bliſſe. That man neuer throughly knew what it was to be familiar with God, that complaines of the want of his home and friends, while God is with him. If the Sonne naturally loue his Father,

                         of whom he hath his body; how much more ſhould the children of God loue him, of whom they haue both bodies and ſoules? Carnall Parents and friends are to be loued, but the Creator to be preferd and double imbraced. Loue him therefore moſt of all which thou canſt not looſe; euen thy Redeemer, who (to draw thee vnto his loue, and to deliuer thee from the loue of the world) ſtretched out his armes vpon the croſſe, and ſuffered a moſt vile and curſed death, to purchaſe for thee, not an earthly, but a heauenly and an euerlaſting life▪
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VI. Now Death is and may be feared of the faithfull, and how of wicked Infidels. No man is to be cenſured ſimply for the manner or ſuddenneſſe of Death. We may not couet to know our death, or for any thing to ſhorten our life.
                     
                        THere is no one greater hinderance (to the 
                           section 1 cheerefull reſolution of our death and departure) then the fore-conceiued feare of fleſh and blood againſt the ſame. And this is

common to all men (without exception of any,) in a meaſure and degree; for ſo long as wee remaine in this body of ſinne, wee cannot chooſe but feare death (the wages thereof,Rom. 6.23.) which followeth and purſueth the ſinner to his graue, as the ſhadow doth the body till the Sunne be ſet. And indeede it is both naturall in all to deſire their being, and ſo to hate Death, depriuing them thereof in this world: as alſo lawfull in Gods children for their true humiliation, before they be exalted in the higheſt heauens. It may be feared, in regard it is the deſtruction of nature in a mans owne ſelfe and others;Luk. 22.44. and in this reſpect Chriſt feared it himſelfe, without any ſinne: But wee muſt not feare it otherwiſe, then ſickneſſe, pouertie, famine, with other calamities of body and minde, which God will not haue vs to deſpiſe or lightly regard, but to feele the paine thereof, becauſe they are ſent as puniſhments for ſinne; and he doth therefore lay paines and torments vpon vs, that they may be feared and eſchewed; and that by eſchewing them, wee may further learne to hate the cauſes of them, which are our ſinnes, and by our experience in feeling paine, to acknowledge that God is a iuſt Iudge, and an enemie to ſinne.
                     And albeit (I grant) that the moſt faithfull men haue their fits of feare, yet are they euer free from the bondage 
                           section 2 and ſtate of thoſe that haue no hope: For although they die in body, yet are they free from eternall death: And this is their bleſſing indeede, not that they ſhall not die, but that the ſnares of death cannot hold them; not that they ſhall not feare, but that feare ſhall not conquer them: and he is a true chriſtian man, that neither refuſeth to die, nor yet fainteth for any feare of death. Before iudgement it is good to be afraide, that thou maiſt finde fauour at the tribunall of the Iudge. Faith and a religious feare are alwaies friends in a Chriſtian man. The feare of Gods iudgement is as a needle, the loue of God as a thread; firſt the needle entreth, and then followeth the thread. Faith ſtriketh Gods children with feare and terrour,
                           Bernard.
                         and anone

vanquiſheth and ouercommeth the ſame; it feareth vs with the greatneſſe of him whom we offend, and yet ouercommeth the ſame by leading vs to Chriſt, our attonement to God.
                     
                        
                           section 3 And as it is (ſometime) no fortitude or man-hood to be afraide to die, but a ſtupor and ſtoicall obſtinacie: So to feare death approaching, is not alwaies a note of infidelitie and miſtruſt of Gods loue, ſeeing feare many times proceedes from the infirmitie of nature or ſexe. Ezechiah was an vpright man, yet feared he the ſentence of Death, his very bones did ſhiuer and all his ioynts did quake, yea, his tongue did chatter like a Swallow;Eſa 38.3. &c. Luk. 22.44. and Chriſt himſelfe had his agonies and wreſtlings. The affections of nature are not ſimply euill in themſelues, but lawfull and tollerable when they are ordered by Gods ſpirit. But if we feare death, let vs ſeeke out the cauſe of this feare: are our ſinnes the cauſe? let vs repent and amend: Is it the loue of this world? let vs hate it: Is it for want of faith? let vs pray, Lord helpe our vnbeliefe.
                     
                     
                        
                           section 4 But what ſpeake I ſo much to true Chriſtians, concerning the feare of Death, they hauing ſo many cauſes rather to imbrace the ſame? Firſt to ſhew their ſubiection and obedience to Gods will, by the example of Chriſt; Father not my will, but thy will be done. Secondly, for as much (as by death) all ſinne is aboliſhed, and wee for euer ceaſe to offend our God any more: Our bodies likewiſe are brought to a better condition then euer they were in our liues; for by death they are made inſenſible, and ſo freed from all the miſeries of this life, ceaſing to be the inſtruments of ſin any more. Againe, it giues the ſoule paſſage to reſt, life and heauenly glory, in which we ſhall ſee our God as he is, perfectly know him, and praiſe his name, keeping an eternall Saboath in the celeſtiall places. And laſtly, it executeth Gods iudgement vpon the wicked, and purgeth his Church from ſuch filthy dung and droſſe. Let Pagans therefore (ſaith Cyprian) and Infidels feare Death, who neuer feared God in their life; but let Chriſtians goe as

trauellers vnto their natiue home, and as children to their Father, willingly & gladly. Balaam would faine haue comforted himſelfe with riches & honour (which he eſteemed ſo much,) yet was he not without feare, which at laſt brake out,Numb. 23.10. and forced him to wiſh that his ſoule might die the death of the righteous, and that his latter end might be like vnto theirs: So (I beleeue) it is with all wicked reprobates, they know it, and euen (as Ioſuah ſaith) withall their hearts,
                        Ioſu. 23.14. 
                        and withall their ſoules they know it▪ that the righteous mans life is better then theirs, and tremble and quake at the remembrance of their owne death, which is farre worſe then theirs, deſiring to die the death of thoſe, who in their life and practiſe they vtterly deteſt.
                     True it is, that wicked men (in appearance) die quietly 
                           section 5 in their beds,Iob 21.13. hauing (as Iob ſpeaketh) no bonds in their death: But iudge ſuch a one no more by his death, then by his birth; for many women may haue more eaſie trauell of a reprobate, then ſome of an elect childe of God. Hypocriſie it may be, hath put the conſcience to ſilence here, that they may more ſuddenly and fearefully roare out in hell. It may be a cruſt is growne vpon their hearts, that they rot and feſter within, and feele it not; whereas the elect haue the wound of their ſinne kept alwaies open; neither can they flye the leaſt breach of the Lords diſpleaſure, but are anguiſhed; neither can they thinke that they euer feare inough; which tender heart of a Chriſtian, is like the Adamant, as it to draw the iron, ſo this to draw the oyle of grace into his ſoule, for his ſolace. If a man die like a Lamb, and paſſe out of the world (like a bird in a ſhell) the ſottiſh ſort, ſay that certainly hee is ſaued; although neither holineſſe was in his life, nor God in his mouth, grace in his heart, nor yet repentance, faith, or feeling at his death. Such men ſaith one (excepting their feather-beds and pillowes) die liker beaſts, then Chriſtians: For they ſhall neuer haue their ſinnes forgiuen, which firſt or laſt doe not vndergoe a holy deſpaire for them, acknowledging nothing to remaine in themſelues, but matter

of iudgement and euerlaſting death, and comfort and eternall life, to flow alone from Ieſus Chriſt. For thorow him we ſee our ſinnes purged, the diuell vanquiſhed, death and condemnation aboliſhed, our ſelues eſtabliſhed and infranchiſed into the libertie and freedome of the Saints in heauen. Are we ready to goe out of this world (as the Iſraelites out of Egypt?Exod. 9.12.22. let vs ſprinckle our hearts with the blood of the Lambe, and the deſtroyer ſhall not enter, nor haue power to hurt vs.Rom. 8.32. Let vs call to minde Gods loue, who ſpared not his Sonne, but gaue him to death for vs, and how ſhall he not giue vs all things with him?
                     
                        
                           section 6 The ſteps of Saints (ſaith one) and the ſtate of ſinners, their liues (I meane) and deaths, are here equally bound vp with the coards of corruption, yet vnequally matched in the ioy of their ſeperation: the one falling away like a flower (tranſplanted to a better ſoyle) the other ruſhing vpon the rocke of Gods wrath, either ſhamefully deiected with the horrour of iudgement (while they liue) or elſe fearefully entangled with the feare of torment when they die. Yet may we not in conſcience cenſure any man ſimply for his manner of death, or ſudden departure: for many ſickneſſes ſlay men ſuddenly, euen while they haue meate in their mouthes, and are full merry: Many are ſharpe, and of long continuance, as the Palſie, Sciatica, or Hipgoute (as Phyſitions beſt doe know:) Some take away the vſe of the tongue and other members, as the Apoplexie and falling euill: Some the wits, as the Phrenſie, and burning feauer, and other ſtrange and vnknowne diſeaſes, as experience it ſelfe doth proue; and therefore it is good to be prepared in our Chriſtian eſtate. But in all theſe ſtrange aſſaults of our brethren, we muſt iudge the beſt; for there neuer can be an euill death where a conſtant good life hath gone before: For as many (amidſt theſe torments) doe ſuddenly paſſe to the Paradiſe of Gods Saints; ſo many dying peaceably in their beds, are ſwiftly tranſlated from earth to hell;Pſal. 116.15: yet ſtill precious in Gods ſight is the death of his Saints.

Correct therefore thy euill life, and feare not an euill death, for he cannot die ill that liues well.

                         So that ſudden death is onely euill to them which lead an euill life; it finding them vnprepared carrieth them ſuddenly to hell: But it cannot be euill to them which liue well, for finding them prepared, it freeth them from paine which others indure, by long and lingring ſickneſſe, and brings them forthwith to the place of happy reſt. Some pray againſt ſodaine Death, which yet can neuer come ſodainely to Gods Saints, whoſe whole life is a continuall meditation of Death. We ought rather to pray to be deliuered from a bad and wicked life, which maketh the death of the reprobate ſo ſodaine and fearefull. And with what reaſon can we name Death ſodaine, which euery day manifeſteth it ſelfe to all our ſences? For what elſe doe we heare from the cradle, then lamentations & mourning for the dead? What doe we oftner ſee with our eyes, then exequies and funerals of the departed; mourners weedes, and monuments of men deceaſed? Now if we regard not the burials of others; Death commeth home to our owne doores, and houſes, to our friends and kinsfolkes: Yea, how often are we our ſelues remembred in our owne perſons, by the meſſengers of Death? Who hath not ſometime or other bin in danger of the ſame, by ſea or land, by ſtorme or tempeſt, by warre or famine, by theeues or

Pyrots, by ſickneſſe or ſome diſeaſe or other? Whereſoeuer thou turneſt thee, Death ſtill purſueth thee: Euery mans houſe is as his refuge, and Caſtle; yet how many are ouerwhelmed with the ruines thereof? how many hath the earth ſwallowed vp, and the ayre choaked? Famaine and thirſt (without continuall reliefe) are as Deaths Souldiers, ſtill ready to ſtrike vs to the heart. What ſhall I ſay? Man can no ſooner be named, but his mortalitie is ſounded out. Death therefore can be ſodaine to none, but to wilfull, ignorant, ſecure, and careleſſe ſots, who (although they liue a hundred yeares, and are daily warned thereof) will be ſtill vnprepared.
                     
                        
                           section 8 Againe, ſome are ſo fooliſhly curious, that they would chooſe their kinde of Death.Eccleſ. 9.12. Some require a certaine ſpace and time in their ſickneſſe, for to repent and amend. Some deſire quickly to be rid out of paine, that they be not tormented in themſelues, or troubleſome to their friends; but theſe be notes of our infirmitie and weakeneſſe. True faith maketh a Chriſtian careleſſe of theſe circumſtances, and conſtantly to commit both kinde, manner, ſpace, and time of ſickneſſe, and death it ſelfe, to the wiſe diſpoſing of their almighty and mercifull maker. Neither may we be moued (as many vniuſtly are) for that the time and houre of death is hidden from vs, for herein God manifeſteth his goodneſſe, to keepe vs from preſumption to ſinne; and that we ſhould not deferre our repentance to the latter end. By this meanes he cheereth vs and freeth from that griefe & ſorrow which we ſhould too truely receiue of our death & graue. Thus he reſtraineth the wicked, that they do leſſe hurt to the godly, and the godly themſelues are feared from doing euill, as thoſe that may die to morrow, or (if God will) in a moment: and withall inforceth them to doe well, as thoſe that ſhould liue for euer.
                     
                        
                           section 9 Man knoweth not his end, but as fiſhes are taken with the baite, & birds with the ſnare; ſo death commeth vpon them vnexpected. Which point condemneth ſuch as will ſeeke to Palmiſters, & Pythoniſts, to ſtar-gazers and Phyſiognomiſts,

to Calculators, & birth-Wizards (no better then very Witches) to Babilonicall, or rather Diabolicall Southſayers, and Inchanters, to know their end and age. But what madnes is this, to deſire to know our end, of ſuch as are ignorant of their owne? Such are like to King Saul,
                        1 Sam. 28.8.9. who ſought to the Witch at Endor,
                        2 Kin. 1.2. &c. & like to Ahazia that ſent to Baalzebub: but what auayled this, but to double their death, in hazarding the ſaluation both of body and ſoule?
                     And as wee may not vſe any vnlawfull meanes for the preſeruation of life, or be too curious in ſearching out 
                           section 10 our death: So muſt none (for any diſtreſſe) be weary of their life, or by any wicked courſe procure their death. God hath giuen no man leaue to depriue himſelfe of the leaſt ſpace of time allotted vnto him for his repentance; nor to ſhorten the benefit of life, which hee hath granted him, to gaine an eternall ſtate. Hee that brought vs into the world hath onely the calling of vs out againe; and when hee calleth thee (and not before) muſt thou depart. Abridge the time wee may not, wee muſt not, for all the croſſes and loſſes this world can lay vpon vs. We muſt ſeeke to mortifie our fleſh in vs, and to caſt the world out of vs; but to caſt our ſelues out of the world, is in no ſort permitted vs. A Chriſtian ought willingly to depart, but not cowardly to runne away: Hee muſt fight therein, as a Souldier in the field; but he may not leaue his place without ſhame and reproach. If it pleaſe the Generall to recall him, let him take the retraite in good part, and with good will obay it, for hee is not borne for himſelfe but for God: of whom he holds his life in farme, (as his tenant at will) to yeeld him both houſe and rent. It is in the Land-lord to take it from him, not in him to ſurrender it, when a conceit or ſullen diſlike ouer-takes him. We muſt not twine a-two the little twiſt of our mortalitie, vntill our clew be ended, but pray to our God, for the thread of his grace, to lead vs out of the labyrinth of ſuch a troubled minde, ready to deſtroy our ſoules. Wee ſhould not ſeeke death, death ſhould rather come to vs,

then wee goe to it before our time. Life is precious, and it is great impietie to bring it into perill. For a man to ſee the greatneſſe of his ſins finally, and not the greatneſſe of Gods grace (in the remiſſion thereof) is Caines diſeaſe,Gen. 4.13. Mat. 27.5. Gen. 9.5. and a fruit of Iudas kiſſe. Will God require bloud at the hand of man and beaſt, and ſhall he not require it at thine owne hand? Thou maiſt not kill another, therefore not thy ſelfe.

The Sunne may be ouer-caſt for a ſeaſon, but the weather will be fayre againe. Chriſt may hide him a little time (as it were) behinde the Curtaines,Cant. 3.4. & 2.9 but his Spouſe at laſt ſhall ſee his chearefull face. I will not feare in the euill day (ſaith the Prophet:) Is not the euill day the day of our end?
                           Aug. in Pſal. 49 5. Aug. tract. 52. in Iohannem.
                         This euill day (by the hope of the reſurrection) is made a good day. The wickedneſſe which our mortall enemy caſteth at our heeles, is now remoued by him,Ioh. 21.18.19. who hath broken his head. Chriſt told Peter, that when hee was old, they ſhould binde and lead him whither hee would not: to ſhew that hee ſhould ſuffer of another, and not of himſelfe. God giueth to euery one their hyre in their due time and turne: But hee who leaues his worke (before God cals him) looſeth his wages; and who importunes him before the time, is deſtitute of reward. Wee muſt reſt then in his will, who in the midſt of our troubles will ſet vs all at reſt in his due time.
                     
                        
                           section 12 Wee muſt therefore neyther hate this life, for the toyles therein (for that is ſloath and cowardlineſſe) nor loue it for the delights, (for that is folly and vanitie:) but ſerue our ſelues of it, to ſerue God in it; who afterward ſhall place vs in ioyfull reſt, and repleniſh vs with

pleaſures, which ſhall neuer more periſh. Againe, to flye it is childiſh, and in flying from it, wee meete it: Much leſſe ought wee to ſeeke it, (for that is temer
                           •
                        tie) nor euery one that would dye, can dye. It is enough that conſtantly wee waite for deaths comming, that ſhee neuer finde vs vnprouided. Wee muſt not fall ſodainely vpon death, but march valiantly towards the ſame, by little and little:
                           Seneca Epiſt. 26. wee muſt not raſhly or vnaduiſedly leaue our life, like one that takes his runne to fetch the better riſe.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VII. Conſolations againſt the agony of Death, and horrour of the Graue, and Corruption.
                     
                        THE very remembrance of Death is bitter 
                           section 1 enough to frayle and mortall man, but the agonies and bickerings wee haue in the fleſh, are farre beyond the conceit of men. For ſuch is the weakneſſe of our nature, and the guiltineſſe of ſinne, (making warre in our fleſh) that without eſpeciall aide and helpe from heauen, wee ſhall be ſwallowed vp of griefe. And what man is hee, ſo ſtrong in Faith, that can contayne himſelfe in this pittifull tryall of deaths combat? It made Chriſt himſelfe to ſweat, and cry, and pray,Luke 22.44. before he got the victory. Although (I confeſſe) the burden of our ſinnes) and Gods wrath, were importable to any but himſelfe, yet was hee fitted with grace and power without meaſure; and for all that felt this horrour: and therefore the beſt and ſtrongeſt regenerate men cannot goe free, but are made conformable to the ſufferings of Chriſt in a meaſure: Beſides, the corruption of ſinne remayning in vs, which finally muſt be purged by the bitter pill of death.
                     
                        Ezechiah (after the ſentence of death pronounced 
                           section 2
                        
againſt him by the Prophet) complayneth how his dayes were cut off, that he ſhould goe to the gates of the graue, to the pit of corruption, where hee could not ſee the Lord any more, in the Land of the liuing: nor the inhabitants of the world, to confeſſe and prayſe God as the liuing doe,Eſa. 38.10. &c. and hope for his truth. He cryes out, that his habitation is remoued like a Shepheards Tent, and his life cut off as the weauers webbe; that God brake all his bones like a Lyon, and ſo made an end of him. This made him in his prayer to chatter like a Swallow, and mourne like a Doue: Hee ſaith, hee was oppreſſed, and walked to his graue in the bitterneſſe of his ſoule, &c. What ſhould I ſpeake of many other of the faithfull? which cry out aliue, as men free among the dead, drawing neere to the graue, and going downe to the pit: who are remembred no more, but cut off by Gods hand, lying in a place of darkneſſe, and in the deepe, feeling Gods wrath lying vpon them, being vexed with all his waues and ſtormes? How doe they ſtretch out their hands with lamentable complaints? ſaying, Shall thy louing kindneſſe be declared in the graue?
                        Pſal. 88.4.5. &c. 
                        or thy faithfulneſſe in deſtruction? Shall thy wondrous workes be knowne in the darke? and thy righteouſneſſe in the land of obliuion? I omit to ſpeake of Iob, of Ionah, and many of Gods children, who haue rufully complained in this caſe.
                     
                        
                           section 3 If the parting company of one way-faring man with another (when they haue trauelled but for a time together) doe cauſe ſuch ſorrow and ſolitarineſſe, what a griefe then will it be, to thinke that two ſuch friends (as the Soule and Body haue beene) ſhall be ſeparated and ſingled one from another, which ſo long haue trauelled together, euen from the mothers vvombe, vntill the inſtant moment of death? Betweene whom there hath beene ſo many knots and bands of mutuall loue. O Death how imperious art thou to carnall mindes, aggrauating their other miſeries, not onely by expectation of future payne, but by the remembrance of wonted ioyes; not ſuffering

them to ſee ought, but what may torment them▪ Great (no doubt) are the horrours of death, when the ſicke man ſhall ſee the world, his friends, and all earthly things, forſaking him; but farre greater is the horrour of iudgement, to conſider hee is now going to anſwere for all that hee hath done in his body, whether it be good or ill. If the countenance of an earthly Iudge be fearefull to a guilty priſoner, how much more ſhall the beholding of an eternall Iudge, amaze all ſuch, who finde a thouſand witneſſes in themſelues, to giue in euidence againſt them? But as hee that is to paſſe ouer ſome great and deepe Riuer, (vpon a narrow plancke and ſtraite paſſage) muſt not looke downeward, to the ſtreame of the water, but (for preuenting of feare) muſt ſet his foote ſure, and caſt his eyes to the bancke on the further ſide: So muſt hee that draweth neare to death (as it were) looke ouer the waues thereof, and fixe the eye of Faith vpon eternall life. If in the time of temptation wee looke to ſayle a right courſe (neyther ſincking nor ſlipping into the gulfe of deſperation, neyther battering our Barke againſt the rocke of preſumption,) let vs in a contrite ſpirit cry to the Lord our God, and ſay, Heale my ſoule,
                        Pſal. 147.3. 
                        for I haue ſinned againſt thee: for thou healeſt thoſe that are broken in heart, and bindeſt vp their ſoares. I ſee (and that with ioy) how my fleſh muſt decay; for looke what freſhneſſe ſoeuer was in it at the firſt, diminiſheth day by day: And I neede not goe farre to ſeeke for death; for I feele not ſo ſmall an infirmitie in my body, but the ſame is vnto mee a meſſenger of diſſolution. Yet for all this, I ſhall ſee my God, and when I am couered in the belly of the graue, I am aſſured hee will reach mee his hand, to raiſe me vp againe to immortalitie and life; ſo that this baſe cottage and ſhade of leaues being brought to duſt, ſhall yet in the end be conuayed vnto my incorruptible houſe in heauen.
                     That diſſolution is well beſtowed, that parts the ſoule 
                           section 4 from the body, to vnite them both to God. All our life here is but a vitall death: How gainefull therefore is that

death that determines this falſe and dying life, and beginnes a true and happy life?Acts 7.56. Hee that hath Stephens eyes to looke into heauen, cannot but haue the tongue of the Saints,Reuel. 22.20. to ſay; Come quickly Lord Ieſus. Such a man (ſeeing the glory of the end) cannot but contemne the hardneſſe of the way: but who ſo wants theſe eyes, though hee ſay, and ſweares hee feares not death, beleeue him not. But is thy ſoule ſorrowfull vnto death? Remember Chriſts prayer in his Agonie,Luke 22.42. 
                        Father, not my will, but thine be fulfilled: Teaching vs what to doe in the time of diſtreſſe, what wee ſhould thinke, how wee ſhould ſpeake, whom wee ſhould inuocate. In his temptation hee withſtood the Tempter, to ſhew vs how to come out of temptation:Mat. 4 4. In his Agonie hee prayed, to teach vs how, and what to pray.
                     
                        
                           section 5 Let vs call to minde how wee loſt happineſſe, in ſeeking to ſaue ourſelues; and iuſt it is, (that by induring ſorrowes) wee ſhould recouer what wee haue loſt. Wee ranne away by committing euill, and wee muſt returne againe by ſuffering euill. Once wee ſinned by tranſgreſſing righteouſneſſe, and now wee muſt humble ourſelues by induring for righteouſneſſe.Iob 1.15.16.17.18. Great were Iobs croſſes, which he endured; none of his Sonnes and Seruants were left, but onely foure meſſengers, to bring him tidings of ſorrow; and thoſe not altogether, but one after another, to increaſe the ſame.
                           Ierom. ad Iulian.
                         All Iobs comforts goe away together, and Sathan was perſwaded that this trayne of troubles would haue blowne vp the ſtrongeſt fort; but he is deceiued, Iob is the ſame man ſtill: For hee that did truly ſerue God in time of proſperitie, did alſo bleſſe him in his greateſt aduerſitie. Here was patience with thankfulneſſe well met together. Sathan tooke away many things from him, but God he could not take away, that gaue him all;Iob 13.15. his reſolution was too ſtrong for that, Though he kill mee, yet will I not be kept from truſting in him. It is God that knoweth the perils of thy death, and can onely defend thee. Through his power ſhalt thou get thorow,

and drinke the bitter draught: Though wee dye, yet liueth God before vs, with vs, after vs, and is able to preſerue vs for euer.
                     Death (as one ſpeaketh) is euen as a darke caue in the 
                           section 6 ground, but who ſo taketh Chriſts true light and candle, (in beleeuing on him) and goeth into that dimme and darke hole, the miſt flyeth before him,Ioh. 19.39.40. and the darkneſſe vaniſheth away: The ſweet ſpices of Chriſt his buriall, expelleth the ſtrong ſcent and ill ſauour of our rotten graues. He is our hope, our ſafeguard, our triumph, our crowne; wee may be dead,Col. 3.3.4. but our life is hid with God in Chriſt. Our true life then is not in this world, but laid vp with God in heauen, and ſhall in time (through Chriſt) be gloriouſly reuealed. And although after our departure from our ſoft lodgings and beds of Downe, our bodyes muſt be placed for a time in darke dungeons and loathſome graues, there to rot in the earth, and be conſumed of wormes; yet Chriſtians looking vpon them (in this ſo vile eſtate as they appeare) with the Chryſtall eyes of Faith, and conſidering them aright, as now altered and changed by Chriſt (who hath vanquiſhed Death and purſued her to her denne) we neede not to bewayle our euill exchange, or thinke our bargaine hard; for that our bodies hereafter ſhall become moſt beautifull and precious, and euen conformable to the glorious body of Chriſt himſelfe.Phil. 3.24. And albeit the gate of death be ſo narrow and hard a paſſage, yet our heauenly Father ſhorteneth it; and though the paines thereof ſhould paſſe all that wee haue felt vpon the earth, it endureth not long, but maketh quicke diſpatch; and when the paine is greateſt of all, then is it neareſt an end, and God can then more comfort vs, then the moſt horribleſt death, with the pangs thereof, are able to diſturbe or torment vs.
                     Such is the ſtate of this world, that one euill cannot be 
                           section 7 cured but by another: To heale a contuſion or bruiſe, muſt be made an inciſion. All the paines that our life yeeldeth vs, at the laſt houre we impute to death, not marking that

as our life beganne and continued in all ſorts of griefe and ſorrow, ſo neceſſarily muſt it end in like afflictions. Wee marke not (as one ſaith) that it is the remainder of our life, not of death, that tormenteth vs: The end of our nauigation that paineth vs, not the hauen wee are to enter, which is nothing elſe but a ſure refuge, againſt all ſtormes. And thus wee complaine of death,
                           Ph. Mor. de vita & morte.
                         when wee ſhould indeed complaine of life: as if one hauing beene long ſicke, (and now beginning to be well) ſhould accuſe his health of his former paine, and not the reliques of his diſeaſe. For what is it elſe to be dead, then to be no more aliue in the world? Now ſimply not to be in the world, is it any paine? did we then feele any paine when we were not?
                     
                        
                           section 8 Nothing better reſembleth death then our ſleepe, and when doe wee euer better reſt then at that time? Now if this be no paine, why accuſe we death of the paines (our life yeeldeth vs) at our departure? vnleſſe wee will fondly accuſe the time, when as yet wee were not, of the paines wee felt at our birth? If our comming in be with teares, is it a wonder that our going out be anſwerable? If the beginning of our being be the beginning of our paine, is it any maruell that ſuch ſhould be our ending? Death is no wayes hurtfull to thoſe that be liuing, and for the dead they are out of his reach.
                           Seneca Epiſt. 24. Such a death is neuer to be deplored, which is ſeconded with immortalitie and euerlaſting life. Wilt thou feare that once which is alwayes acted? Feareſt thou to dye once, when thou dyeſt euery day by little and little?
                           Seneca Epiſt. 71. Death, which wee ſo feare and flye, taketh not from vs our life, but giueth it truce and intermiſſion for a time.
                           & Epiſtola 57. Neyther children nor mad-men feare Death, and how abſurd is it, that reaſon and wiſedome ſhould not be as able to furniſh vs with ſecuritie, as they are fortified by their ſimplicitie and fury?
                     
                        
                           section 9 What hurt is it to the inhabitant, to pull downe an old ruinous houſe, to build it vp againe, and make it more glorious? Now our bodies are as old rotten houſes, for our ſoules to dwell in; if God cauſe our ſoules to depart

then out of our bodies for a time; and ſo deſtroy them, to build them vp againe, and make them fitter habitations for our ſoules, haue we any cauſe to mourne? Nay, rather if we looke not ſo much on the preſent condition of our bodies after death, as vpon their glorious eſtate at the day of reſurrection (by the eye of faith) wee haue great cauſe to praiſe our God, for this our good exchange. And why ſhould the faithfull be affraide of Death, by which they are deliuered from the ſlauery of ſinne? For when Death hath made vs all, euen leuell with the ground; the graue ſhall be to vs as a fould, vntill our Shepheard come; and to the wicked as a ſhambles, till the deſtroyer of their ſoules ſhall haue receiued an endleſſe commiſſion to torment them. What cauſe haue wee then to ſhut our gates againſt the gaſpe of Death? Or like trembling leaues, to entertaine the gale and blaſt of ſickneſſe, which doth but prune our feathers, to flye both faſter and ſwifter towards heauen itſelfe. For if neither the waight of our corruption (though it ſorely preſſe vs) nor the violence of affliction (though it ſoundly beat vs) can ſeparate vs from the loue of God, nor the league with his creatures;Iob 5.23. 
                        Rom. 8. Into what fond vanities are we fallen, if we would ſtill be hedged in and enthralled in this vale of teares? and not deſire to aſcend on that ladder, which Iacob knew to be the gate of heauen?Gen. 28.17. the skirts whereof (but ſeene and felt of the Apoſtles) did ſo rauiſh all their ſences with delight, as that they onely vaunted in the croſſes of Chriſt,Acts 4.24. which was alſo their preſeruatiue againſt the feare of death, and their ſpurre and preparatiue to ſet the houſes of their hearts in order, before they deſcended to the graue?
                     We may learne by the very foode that nouriſheth vs 
                           section 10 (euen our meates and drinks) to what loathſomneſſe they come, before they worke their perfection in vs. From life they are brought to death, being dead to the fire, & ſo clean altered from that they were aliue; from the fire they come to the trenchers and knife, all to hackt and cut; and from the trencher to the mouth, and there be ground as ſmall

as the teeth can make them; and ſo from the mouth to the ſtomacke, there to be boyled and dreſſed, before they be fit for our nouriſhment. Is it then any maruell if Chriſtians (who are to be as Gods delicates and dainties) in the life to come, be now ſo defaced and deformed in this world, (as in a Kitchin and Mill, to boyle and grinde them,) ſhould by death and the graue, be quite altered and changed for a time, till they atchiue their happie perfection in the world to come? And as we looke for no nutriment of our meate, before it be digeſted: So muſt we not expect for our happy ſtate of heauenly bliſſe, before the corruption of the world and fleſh be firſt ſwallowed vp of immortalitie. Raw fleſh is not fit meate for the ſtomack, nor vnmortified men meete for God and heauen, till by death and graue they be altered, and by Gods ſpirit renewed, as fit Citizens for his kingdom. Let vs therefore waite for ſickneſſe (as the fore-runner of ſleepe,) and welcome death (as the ſickle of the Lords harueſt,) beholding our graue as the faithfull treaſurie of our bodies, and look vp to heauen as the vndoubted Paradiſe of our ſoules.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII. In what things our Chriſtian preparation to Death doth chiefely conſiſt.
                     
                        
                           section 1
                        HAuing indeauoured to remoue ſuch impediments as hinder preparation, and warned Gods children to auoide ſome dangerous rocks, in this their narrow nauigation towards the hauen of death; it ſeemeth now as neceſſarie (for their better encouragement) to ſet downe ſome ſafe directions, to guide them in this perillous way, that chearefully they may paſſe on without any ſtay, till they ioyfully arriue at the land of heauenly reſt. Great prouiſion (I confeſſe) would be made for this long and waightie voyage, but ſo many things being obſerued by others,

I will briefely paſſe by them, and come to the principall prouiſion it ſelfe.
                     And as for the diſpoſing and well ordering of our goods 
                           section 2 and worldly ſtate, it is beſt to diſpatch this buſineſſe in the time of our ſtrength and health, before we be bound to our beds, and haue to deale with ſickneſſe (which troubleth all our ſenſes) with Phyſition, with Death, and Sathan himſelfe, which then will be moſt buſie to moleſt vs; neither will this ſo ſhort a time ſuffice, for ſo many waightie imployments.Eccleſ. 12.1. 
                        Remember thy Creatour in the daies of thy youth (ſaith the wiſe man.) Much more then ought we wholy to thinke on him in the time of ſicknes; when euery day is ſuſpected to be the laſt day we haue to liue. Many are affraide to make their Teſtaments betime (as things infortunate, and preſaging euill) but this is their ignorance and infidelitie: For the diſpoſing of our worldly goods, and exempting our ſelues from earthly cares, maketh none die more quickly, but more quietly.Eſay 38.1. So had Ezechiah counſel from God to put his houſe in order; & Abraham deuided his goods to Iſaac, & the reſt of his Sons:Gen. 25.56. So Iſaac (dim ſighted) yet in good and perfect health, tooke order for his children before his death; So did Iacob for his Sonnes, after his Fathers example: Which duetie is very fit to be ſeaſonably performed of euery Chriſtian,& 27. of any ſtate or wealth, for the cutting off of contention betweene brethren and kinsfolkes. Beſides that,& 29. many diſeaſes are ſo ſharpe and ſodaine, they giue men ſmall leaſure to diſpoſe of themſelues; much leſſe ſo large a time, as to order their goods and familie. As he that dreamed of long life, had ſuddenly his anſwere; thou foole, this night ſhall they take away thy ſoule:Luk. 12.17. Luk. 17.26.27 & Sodainely came the flood vpon the wicked world, being eating and drinking; and ſodainely was Sodome conſumed with fire, amidſt their fleſhly pleaſures: Sodainly fell the Tower vpon the eighteene men in Syloah,
                        Luk. 13 4. 2 Pet. 3.10. not expected: and ſodainely will Chriſt come in the cloudes, as a theefe in the night:Apoc. 3.3. But becauſe all men (for the moſt part) are prouident inough for theſe worldly

matters, and meanes of ſtate, family, friends, Phyſicke, &c. I come to more neceſſarie matters, concerning the ſoule againſt the time of neede.
                     
                        
                           section 3 The chiefeſt furniture and beſt prouiſion therefore for a Chriſtian man (againſt his death and departure out of life) are faith, hope, and a conſcience vndefiled. Faith in Chriſt, is as Noahs Arke to ſaue vs from drowning in the flood of our ſinnes; and from the deuouring of the dangerous gulfe of death, amidſt the proud waues, and bottomeleſſe ſea of our innumerable tranſgreſſions; able to ſinke and ſwallow vs vp with the wicked world: And hope in God, is as the vnmoueable anchor, faſtned to the almighty power of God (as to the moſt ſtrong and vntwineable cable) ready prepared to keepe vs from Shipwrack of our ſoules, in all the raging ſtormes, fearefull tempeſt, and rough paſſages of Death and Hell. For albeit Death be a fray-bug to all faint-harted Souldiers, and faithleſſe men (not built vpon Chriſt the corner ſtone, by a liuely faith, and vndoubted hope,) threatning, and fearing them with the loſſe of life, worldly wealth, and all things elſe: Yet the flocke of Chriſt, doe ſcorne and deſpiſe her; who account all the world (with his wealth and pleaſures) but dung and droſſe; yea, all things loſſe to win the loue of Chriſt.Phil. 3.8. Their riches and treaſures are placed on high, whither their affections and delights were ſent before; not baſely groueling and crawling vpon this filthy earth below, but aſpyring and climing to the heauen of heauens, whither long before they were aſcended and ſetled. All earthly things to them are but as toyes and trifles, their inheritance is in heauen, there is the true portion of their cuppe,Mat. 6.20. there be the Iemmes and Iewels that they affect, euen ſuch as are ſafe from ruſt, and free from corruption; And thither they are aſſured (by death) to be ſpeedily conuayed.
                     
                        
                           section 4 He that hath not the helmet of the hope of a better life to come, muſt needs be vnwilling to leaue this preſent life, eſpecially if he haue any portion of comfort in the ſame;

needes muſt he feare to forſake it, when hee heareth and ſeeth how roughly death dealeth with other men round about. This maketh Phyſicke ſo ſeriouſly ſought for (though neuer ſo coſtly,) and Phyſitians more honoured of many, then the God of heauen himſelfe: This cauſeth ſo many ſalt brine teares to trickle and diſtill from the eyes of worldly men, being in danger to die, which (although they be reputed to come from a remorſed ſoule for ſinne) yet from many (God knoweth) they proceede from this fountaine; namely, that they are flitting from this world, where (if they might liue) they are ſure of ſomething, vnto another life, where they are vncertaine of any good thing. Such men are as a Ship without ſayle or anchor, toſſed and tumbled with euery ſtorme and tempeſt, and alwayes in ieopardie of ſincking or ſhip-wracke.
                     Therefore that we may be aſſured, that we truely haue and enioy theſe precious iewels of a ſauing faith, and hope 
                           section 5 vnmoueable? we muſt labour to approue, or rather finde out the ſame, by a Chriſtian life, and an vndefiled conſcience. For, euen as pure and chriſtall water, commeth from a quicke fountaine and liuely ſpring incorrupted: So doth a good conſcience, and holy life, from an vnfained faith. And as in digging of Wels, we firſt finde out and diſcerne the ſtreames of cleare water, iſſuing from the liuely ſpring; and in ſearching for mettals of gold, ſiluer, copper, braſſe, or tinne, wee firſt know wee haue found out the Mines thereof by the ſhining and gliſtering veynes in the earth, appearing vnto vs: So if wee will not miſſe but meete with a liuely faith and blameleſſe hope, we muſt firſt diſcerne them by the powerfull fruits of a ſanctified life; alwaies attended vpon by the hand-mayde of a pure and vndefiled conſcience. Theſe be the remarkable ſtreames of the true and liuing fountaine of a ſauing, faith, and the vndeceiueable veines of theſe rich and wealthy Mynes of an inuincible hope, to inrich our ſoules.1 Tim. 1.5. Loue out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and faith vnfained, be linkes of one chaine, beames of one Sunne, ſtreames of

one riuer, fruit of one tree, twins of one womb, &c. To ſeparate any of theſe is to make ſhip-wrack of the ſoule. A good conſcience watcheth ouer the ſoule, Charitie is carefull to keepe Gods commandements; and a pure heart loueth and imbraceth God aboue all; and faith vnfained is neuer aſhamed of profeſſing Chriſt, and his Goſpell for 
                           section .6 any trouble.
                     By faith conceiued in the heart, profeſſed with the mouth, and practiſed with the hand, the righteous man liueth: For as it is certaine, there is no ſaluation without faith; So there is no faith without repentāce; no repentance without amendment of life, nor any amendment without forſaking of ſinne: whence wee may conclude, that no euill liuer hath any part in Chriſts death, but the markes of Gods vengeance abiding on him; and that he aduentureth his ſaluation that deferreth his repentance. For what knoweſt thou, whither tomorrow ſhall euer come? Dally not therefore thus with God, till the Diuell take thee in the lurch: For as Chriſt came to ſaue vs from the damnation of ſinne; ſo alſo to free vs from the dominion of ſinne;1 Ioh. 3.8. and as he was ſent to deſtroy the Diuell, ſo likewiſe to ouerthrow the workes of the Diuell: And moſt abſurd it is, for ſuch as are the ſlaues of ſinne, to vaunt themſelues for the ſeruants of God.
                     
                        
                           section 7 The praiſe of faith is, to ouercome by fighting, that the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt may be made ſtrong by our infirmitie.2 Cor. 12.9. He that hath a ſoule, muſt needs breath, and he that hath Gods ſpirit, muſt needs bring forth the fruits thereof. Faith (I confeſſe) is euer alone in iuſtifying, but neuer alone in the perſon iuſtified: euen as the eye alone ſeeth, but the eye ſeparate from the body doth not ſee at all, but is a dead eye: As Chriſt neuer raiſed vp himſelfe without his humanitie, yet not his humanitie but his diuinitie raiſed him vp. Though faith doth worke by loue, yet is it not incloſed in Faith (as Papiſts ſay) like a Diamond in a Ring: neither yet is Faith as the ſhell, and Charitie as the kernell; but faith muſt haue this place which

apprehendeth Chriſt, who adorneth faith as the colour beautifieth the wall. Faith is a certaine obſcure knowledge, or rather darkneſſe in it ſelfe, which ſeeth nothing, and yet Chriſt (apprehended by faith) ſitteth in this darkneſſe (as God in mount Sinai) and in the temple: Wherefore Chriſt apprehended, and dwelling in the heart,Exod. 19.9. by Faith, is the true Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, who giueth vs eternall life. Chriſt is the Lord of our life, in him we are by faith, and he in vs. This Bridegroome muſt be alone with the Bride, in his ſecret chamber (all the ſeruants and family ſet apart;) but after (when the doore is open) then let them miniſter vnto them, let Charitie doe her office, and all good workes be buſie. When Faith is feeble, Loue looſeth her feruor; but pray wee the Lord to increaſe our Faith, and Loue forthwith will be on fire. By Faith indeede we take hold of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; by which alone, we are reconciled vnto God: but of this wee cannot take hold, except withall, we apprehend the ſanctification of Gods ſpirit; for he was giuen to vs for righteouſneſſe, wiſedome, ſanctification, and redemption.1 Cor. 1.30. Therefore Chriſt iuſtifieth none, whom he doth not alſo ſanctifie. Wherefore our indeuour and care muſt be (for the ſure approuing of our faith and hope,) to haue in readineſſe a pure heart, and vndefiled conſcience, which may be as vnreprouable witneſſes before God and man, that we haue had a ſincere care to pleaſe our God, not onely in outward action, but inward affection, labouring to the vtmoſt of our knowledge and power, to put in practiſe all the holy duties of our callings, towards God and man. Thus if our heart condemne vs not, we are ſure to haue peace with God, howſoeuer we are troubled in the world,1 Ioh. 3.20. or afflicted in the fleſh.
                     Now to clenſe our conſcience, and to haue it ſingle and ſincere, is by the blood-ſhedding of Chriſt, which 
                           section 8 hath ſatisfied for our ſinnes, whoſe death (apprehended by a liuely faith) doth purifie and purge the ſame.Acts 15.9. Which conſcience thus cleared, ſhall now no more accuſe, but excuſe

vs before our God. And albeit our former ignorance and infidelity, hardnes of heart, & ſecuritie (with the innumerable euils both originall and actuall) haue ſtained and defiled the ſame heretofore: yet now our conſcience (being bathed in the blood of Chriſt, and rinſed from the guilt of ſinne and vncleanneſſe) doth henceforward, behold Gods anger turned into fauour, his iuſtice into mercy, &c. Which ſight ſo purifieth a Chriſtian ſoule, that neither death nor diuell can dant it.
                     But on the contrary, ſuch as want this good teſtimonie 
                           section 9 of the conſcience (purified by faith in the blood of Chriſt) their caſe is very dangerous, lying ſtill in their ſinnes, which in the time of Gods viſiting hand, will ſting them deadly, and in this world (if they be not awakened by repentance, but lye ſnorting in the ſame till their dying day,) their conſcience that hath furfeited of ſinne in this life, will vomit all in their faces, when they come once to their reckoning. For as a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt, and paradiſe to him that hath it: ſo an euill one is a perpetuall plague, and priſon to the ſoule; and like the raging ſea,Eſay 57.20.21. that caſts vp mire and durt. A pure conſcience (ſaith one) is as the ſweeteſt ſugar, to delay the bitterneſſe of all afflictions; it is as marrow in the bones, and good blood in the veynes; as ſound health to the body, fitting and inabling it to ſuſtaine all bluſtering ſtormes, and winter blaſts: It is as a watch-tower, and Beacon on a hill, to giue vs warning and word of all danger imminent to our life: As a Trumpet to awaken vs from our ſinnes: It is as the match and tinder, to kindle the fire and zeale of all holy deuotion; faith, and obedience, ſtill pricking vs forward to all vertue and godlineſſe, till wee end our daies in peace. We may ſay of the conſcience (as Zeno the Philoſopher) of a Wife, that ſhee is a continuall comfort, or a perpetuall croſſe. A good conſcience is an inuincible Tower, it may be beſieged, but neuer battered and raced to the ground: It will neither be borrowed, nor bought, nor ſould; yet if it ſhould be ſet a ſale, few

would buy it. The bed of a good Conſcience flouriſheth alwayes, as the greene borders in a Garden.
                     If our hearts be ſetled in loue and obedience to the 
                           section 10 Lord, all the world beſides cannot defile vs. Our heart is the ſafeſt Tower of defence that wee haue in all our life: take heede therefore of thy heart; for if it accuſe thee, it will kill thee: If it be on thy ſide, let the heauens fall, yet the ruines thereof ſhall not affright thee; let thy foes be what they will, let their counſell be what it can, and deſtruction (that is conſpired) neuer ſo cruell, yet if thy heart be faithfull to God, thy enemies ſhall feare more then thou: for Innocencie aſſiſteth thee, (which is ſtrengthened with the arme of God) and cannot be conquered by any meanes of Man, Death, or Diuell. Though nature be weake to raiſe vp it ſelfe, and aduerſities and temptations ſtrong to caſt it downe; yet both troubles and temptations flye faſt away before the face of our truſt in God. O Lord take from mee (ſaith one) (if thou wilt) my goods and riches, my pleaſures, &c. yea my life to,
                        
                           Anſelm. in med.
                         
                        ſo thou leaue mee my heart, which way neuer ceaſe to loue thee, truſt in thee, and call vpon thy name. Thou canſt not be friends with thy ſelfe, till thou be with God; for thy Conſcience (like an honeſt ſeruant) taketh his maſters part againſt thee, when thou haſt ſinned, and will not countenance thee till thou be reconciled to God; neyther dare it be kinde to thee, and vnfaithfull to her Maker. God doth commit men to their Conſcience (as vnto a Tutor) which vigilantly attends vpon them:
                           Iſidor.
                         and a man may better flye from any thing then from his owne heart: And therefore this hath alwayes beene the ioy and reioycing of the faithfull,1 Theſ. 2.10. to haue the witneſſe of a good conſcience, that they haue ſimply and honeſtly walked with men in this world: This is their Crowne and comfort, to thinke how holily and vnblameably they haue behaued themſelues; that they haue fought a good fight, and finiſhed their courſe, and kept the faith; that they haue kept the profeſſion of their hope without fainting,2 Tim. 4.7. ſtill (with a good Conſcience) making their requeſt

to God. This oyle of gladneſſe hath cheared their countenance, and this pure wine of a good Conſcience hath gladed their heart; amidſt all their griefe it hath ſweetned their ſorrowes,Rom. 5.2. hauing the loue of God ſhed in their hearts through the holy Ghoſt: And therefore our greateſt care muſt be to haue alwayes a cleare Conſcience towards God and man,Acts 24.16. which will greatly cheare vs againſt our death.
                     
                        
                           section 11 Chriſtians muſt be daily practicioners of Faith and Repentance, they muſt not onely (by mortification of the fleſh) dye to ſinne, but (being renewed in the ſpirit) riſe againe vnto righteouſneſſe and amendment of life. They muſt hate euill and doe good,Heb. 12.14. purſue after peace and holineſſe, without the which no man can ſee God. For as hee that hath a hope to liue againe (when he is dead) muſt dye while hee is aliue, to ſinne and wickedneſſe: So hee that will eſcape the ſecond death,Reu. 20.6. muſt be made pertaker of the firſt reſurrection, to newneſſe of life. And thoſe that are deliuered from darkneſſe, muſt be tranſlated into the Kingdome of Chriſt; and being dead in themſelues, muſt liue the life of Chriſt.Col. 1.13. And this is the end, why they are freed from their deadly foes, to ſerue God in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all their dayes:Luke 2. So ſhall they come to peace of Conſcience, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.
                     
                        
                           section 12 Repentance and amendment of life ſerue vs (as the Cannon ſhot) to ſcatter the cruell bands of Death and Diuell; and ioyning Faith with Repentance, wee ſhall be ſure to winne the field, by the ſafe conduct of Chriſt our Captaine vnconquerable; who (as wee haue heard) hath ſatisfied for our ſinnes, fulfilled the Law, and foyled all our foes. If the day of our death finde vs a ſleepe in our ſinne, woe be vnto vs; for then wee ſhall hardly awake. The end of all things (ſaith Saint Peter) is at hand,
                        1 Pet. 4.7. 
                        therefore be ſober and watch in prayer. Euery one in his death ſhall finde this end of all things: when men are once dead and carryed out of dores, all is at an end with them, neyther hath their body any more then their length of ground.
                     
                        One being demanded when it was time to repent, anſwered,
                           section 13 One day before our death: but when it was replyed that no man knew that day; hee ſaid, Beginne then to day for feare of fayling, and boaſt not of to morrow,
                        Prou. 27.1. 
                        for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth. It is a folly to diſſemble our ſores whilſt they are cureable, and after make them knowne when there is no remedie. Many pretend to amend all in time, and this time is ſo deferred from day to day, vntill God (in whoſe hands onely all times conſiſt) doth ſhut them out of all time, and ſend them to paines eternall, without time, for that they abuſe the ſpeciall benefit of time in this world. For cuſtome groweth to another nature, and old diſeaſes are hardly cured. Wilt thou goe to heauen liuing in ſinne as thou doſt? It is impoſſible. As ſoone thou maiſt driue God out of heauen (ſaith one) as goe thither thy ſelfe in this wicked kinde of life. What then, wilt thou forgoe heauen, and yet eſcape hell? This is leſſe poſſible, whatſoeuer the Atheiſts of this world perſwade thee. Wilt thou deferre the matter, and thinke of it hereafter? Thou ſhalt neuer haue more abilitie to doe it then now; and it may be neuer halfe ſo much againe. If thou refuſe it now, thou maiſt greatly feare to be refuſed thy ſelfe hereafter. There is nothing then ſo good, as to take this good occaſion while it is offered.
                     Breake from thoſe tyrants (which detaine thee in ſeruitude)
                           section 14 the Diuell, Sinne, World, and Fleſh, ſhake off their ſhackles, cut all their bands and chaynes aſunder, free thee from their gyues and irons, and runne violently to Ieſus Chriſt,

                         who ſtandeth (with open armes) ready to imbrace thee;Luke 15.25. make ioyfull all the Angels and Saints with thy conuerſion; ſtrike once the ſtroke with God againe, and returne to thy Father. Who would be ſo baſe minded (with the Prodigall Sonne in this world) rather to eate huskes with the Swine, then to turne home with him againe, to be ſo honourably receiued; haue ſuch good cheare and banketting, and heare ſo great melody, ioy, and triumph for his returne? Hee that will liue without

repentance, muſt looke to dye without repentance. The ſparing of the Theefe on the Croſſe at the laſt gaſpe,Luke 23.43. was ſet out as a medicine againſt deſperation, and not as a matter of imitation.
                           Chriſoſt.
                         God (ſaith one) ſpared one, that no man might deſpaire, and hee ſpared but one, that no man might preſume. The Lord hath promiſed pardon to him that repenteth, but to liue till to morrow hee hath not promiſed.
                     
                        
                           section 15 The heauenly dewe of Repentance neuer fals, but the Sunne of righteouſneſſe draweth it vp. Repentant eyes (bedewed with teares for ſinne) are the cellers of Angels, and penitent ſighes and ſobs the ſweeteſt wines, which the ſauour of life perfumeth, the taſte of grace ſweetneth, and the pureſt colours of returning innocencie, highly beautifieth. O that our hearts were euermore ſuch a Lymbecke, diſtilling ſo pure a quinteſſence of godlineſſe, drawne (from the weedes of our offences) by the fire of true Faith, and vnfayned contrition of ſpirit. Heauen would mourne at the abſence of ſuch precious waters, and earth lament the loſſe of ſuch fruitfull ſhowers. Surely till death cloſe vp thoſe fountaines, they ſhould neuer fayle running; which if they had alwayes iſſue, we neede not doubt of our ſaluation, but that God would waſh away all our filthineſſe and ſinne.

This is the ſure Anchor indeede of the ſoule, which lyeth deepe and is not ſeene, and yet is the ſtay of all, euen the ſoule of our life.

                         And becauſe wee cannot plead the plea of Innocencie, Faith bids vs boldly plead the plea of Mercy, and telleth vs the Iudge is reconciled. But this is no Palſie-faith (as wee haue heard) but firme and conſtant vnto the end, which ſtill concludes (through Chriſt) to the Conſcience (that liuing and dying) we are the Lords. Hope is the piller, ſuſtayning this building of

our Faith, which fayling, our Faith falleth into the gulfe of Deſpayre.

When wee ſeeme (as it were) in the whirle-pit of Deſpayre, and are carryed by a violent ſtreame of trouble wee know not whither, and are conſtrayned to diue and plunge downe, the water of affliction running ouer our ſoules; yet the Lord will recouer vs, and ſet our feet in a ſteady place. If wee be caſt downe, ſo that wee can but ſcrawle vp againe; if wee be ſo tyred of Sathan (by temptations,) that yet wee can but kicke againſt him in affection; if we can but open our lips, and accuſe him of malice before the Lord; there is yet ſome hope of comfort to be found. And in all our tryals and temptations, wee muſt haue recourſe to faithfull prayer, that ſo the burthen thereof may eyther be remoued, or at the leaſt eaſed, or wee better ſtrengthened and inabled to ſuſtaine the ſame.
                     Hope to a Chriſtian (in this life) is as a ſtaffe to a traueller

It is giuen to Hope to enter the garden of pleaſures,Eſay 40.31. and thence to fetch all fragrant ſmels, to ſeaſon the bitterneſſe of our ſorrowes, whoſe nature is to glory in tryals.Rom. 5.3.

                           section 1
                        NOW, for as much as the faireſt frame and building (with all the prouiſion and preparation thereunto) is nothing worth, if the ground-worke and foundation be not ſure and vnmoueable, (beſides the abuſe of the time, coſts, and perſons imployed about the ſame) fruſtrating the purpoſe and end of the builder, with the ruines of deſpayre: So all that hath hitherto beene ſpoken, of Life and Death, of Heauen and Hell, of Chriſtians and Infidels, of Faith and Hope, and other furniture and prouiſion (for the aſſured fruition of a bleſſed life) is but ſpoken in the ayre, and a fighting with our ſhadow, if there be no ſure demonſtration of the vndoubted reſurrection of our bodies. For then (ſaith the Apoſtle Paul) our Preaching is in vaine,1 Cor. 15.14. our Faith in vaine, Chriſt dyed in vaine, all Religion in vaine, the perſecutions and ſufferings of Gods children in vaine; nay, then let vs ſcoffingly conclude (with Epicures and Atheiſts,Verſe 32.33.) Let vs eate and drinke, for to morrow wee ſhall dye. But ſuch euill words corrupt good manners. I will therefore endeauour (as much as in me lyeth) to make it plaine to all mens ſenſes, that are not bruitiſhly ſenſleſſe; or at the leaſt, to make it cleare and out of queſtion to the ſpirituall eye and vnderſtanding of all beleeuers (to whom onely it is giuen of God) to be perſwaded of this truth.

But becauſe the places are ſo many, I will but onely alledge ſome few, very plaine and pregnant to this purpoſe. Firſt then I wil begin with that famous teſtimony of holy Iob, (who wiſheth his

                        1 Cor. 15.52. 
                        I ſaw the dead (ſaith Saint Iohn) both great and ſmall ſtand before God.
                        Reuel. 20.12. Now the Scriptures are not of man, but of God,Tit. 1.2. who is true, and cannot lye.
                     Beſides, there be many reaſons (deriued from the word of God) to conuince the truth hereof.1 Cor. 15.16. 
                        If the dead be not 
                              section 3 raiſed, then Chriſt is not riſen, who is the pledge and aſſurance that Chriſtians ſhall riſe againe, and the Head of his Body the Church, of which wee are members. And as the body cannot dye, nor the members of it (if the head doe liue:) no more can wee dye if Chriſt liue:Col. 1.18. 
                        Becauſe I liue (ſaith hee) you alſo ſhall liue. Secondly,1 Cor. 12.27. becauſe the Spirit of Chriſt dwelleth in our body (for our body is the temple of the holy Ghoſt) therefore they ſhall riſe againe:Iohn 14.19. 
                        1 Cor. 6.19. 
                        Rom. 8.11. For that ſame ſpirit which raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken our mortall bodies, becauſe it dwelleth in vs. If Gods loue be ſo great towards our bodies,2 Tim. 1.12. to haue his Spirit dwell in them, he will not ſuffer them to periſh. Againe, becauſe the faithfull beleeue in God (who alſo loueth them who loue and ſerue him,Iohn 14.1.3.) therefore hee will raiſe vp their bodies. For wee that haue giuen and committed our ſelues vnto God (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) cannot periſh,2 Tim. 1.12. becauſe hee is able to keepe that which is committed vnto him; and will, becauſe he loueth vs,Iohn 16.27. beleeuing in him. If the dead ſhould not be raiſed to life, God ſhould not be iuſt, (which cannot be:Gen. 18.25.) For in this world it hapneth

to him that ſerueth God,Eccleſ. 9.2. as to him that ſerueth him not. Then alſo the body (wherein God was glorified, as well as in the ſpirit) ſhould haue no reward. Then did Chriſt take our nature vpon him in vaine, and in it aſcended into heauen in vaine:Luke 21.18. for it had beene ſufficient onely to take our ſpirit. If the body muſt periſh, then the whole man cannot be ſaued, which is contrary to the Scripture.Pſal. 8.6. & 89.47. Then the moſt excellenteſt creature vnder the Sunne (for whoſe ſake all vnder the Sunne was created) ſhould with all the creatures be made for nought, which is abſurd.
                     
                        
                           section 4 Furthermore, to helpe our naturall incredulitie, and diſtruſt in this point, (for the moſt ſure reſolution of our reſurrection indeede) is it not as eaſie for God (who is almighty) to command the ſea and earth to giue vp their dead,Reuel. 20.13. as it was to make the ſea and earth, and all that is therein of nothing, and that only with a word? It is a leſſe matter (ſaith one) to bring againe vnto life that which is dead, then it was to giue life vnto it before it was made. When thou waſt not, thou waſt made; and when thou ſhalt not be, thou ſhalt againe be made, and liue. Here is nothing ſtrange or vnlikely. Conſider how thou earneſt into this life before thou wert borne, and thou needeſt not doubt, how to be reſtored to life after thou art dead. I omit here to ſpeake of ſo many apt ſimilitudes and fit reſemblances of the vndoubted truth of this point, which the beſt and greateſt Diuines haue fetched and deriued from our meats and drinks, from trees and plants, from corne and graſſe, which in the winter ſeeme to haue neither ſap nor ſhew of life, yet (when the winter is paſt, and the ſpring-time comes) doe liue againe, and are moſt gloriouſly arayed.
                     
                        
                           section 5 How many things are, and come to paſſe, which ere they are, and come to paſſe, we would haue thought they could not be, for that the workes of God are all wonderfull?Mat. 13.32. 
                        The Muſtard-ſeede (ſaith Chriſt) when it is ſowne, is the leaſt of all ſeeds; and when it is growne it is a tree, the greateſt among all hearbs. In one ſo little a graine doth conſiſt the whole greatneſſe of that tree, which afterward commeth

forth. Now if that which we ſee to be true in the graſſe of the field, in the corne that is ſwone, yea, in the ſeede of the trees, and wood which grow (albeit they wither to nought, they rot and dye, yet liue againe,) why ſhould wee not thinke it as true of men, that albeit they dye, and are turned to duſt, that yet they ſhall be raiſed to life againe? For he that is Lord of the ſpirit, and hath life in himſelfe,Ioh. 11.25. Eccleſ 8.8. Ioh▪ 5.2
                              •
                           . Luk. 3.8. and in his owne power and will, can as certainly giue life to the body (which is vtterly without life) as hee is able to giue life to a ſtone, and ſo to a peece of earth, to aſhes, or any other thing. And as it is no harme for the ſeede to be harrowed and hidden in the ground, for that it ſhall ſpring and flouriſh againe, and bring forth fruit in due ſeaſon: no more is it any hurt to our bodies to be caſt into our graues in weakeneſſe, for they ſhall riſe againe in power; being ſowne naturall bodies, they ſhall riſe againe ſpirituall, being ſowne in diſhonour, they ſhall riſe againe in glory; Thoufoole (ſaith Saint Paul) that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned, except it firſt die. A little corne, or wheate,1 Cor. 15.43.44. & 46. or other graine, cannot haue vertue to become ſo fruitfull, in bringing forth thirty or forty times better then it was; being multiplyed to ſo many (all as good as it ſelfe) and bringing forth beſides ſuch fruitfull increaſe of ſtraw and chaffe, except it firſt be caſt into the ground and die. And therefore how ſhouldeſt thou enioy ſo good an exchange, except thou firſt corrupt and die? And how much better art thou then a graine of corne? when thorow corruption thou ſhalt come to incorruption, thy glory then ſhall be vnſpeakeable, and all things ſhall ſerue thee.
                     Thy hope now, if thou couldeſt in large it a thouſand 
                           section 6 fold, yet it ſhall be greater then thou canſt imagine, and thy faith (if it could apprehend more aſſurance of immortalitie, then the cleareſt eye doth of the light of the Sunne,) yet thou ſhalt finde the fruit of it aboue all thy thoughts. This thou ſeeſt, if thou ſee Chriſt by faith; and this thou knoweſt to be true, if thou knoweſt thy ſelfe to be one with him.Gen. 8.11. Numb. 17.8. The keeping greene of Noahs Oliue-tree vnder the flood; the budding againe of Arons rod; the deliuerance

of Ionah from the depth of the Sea;Ion. 1.10. Pſal. 90.3. Iob 19.25. Ezech. 37.4.5.6. &c. the voyce that calleth come againe ye children of men; the hope that Iob hath to ſee God with the ſelfe-ſame eyes; the dry bones that ſhould come bone to bone, and be knit together with ſinewes, &c. may ſtirre vp in vs a ioyfull hope, and cheere our penſiue ſoules, againſt the feare of death, and doubt of our reſurrection: but aboue all, the riſing againe of Chriſt: The voyce of Chriſt (is thorow Chriſt) the voice of Chriſtians, (ſaith Auguſtine,) Death where is thy ſting, Hell where is thy victory?
                        1 Cor. 15 45. If the ſinne of Adam (who was a liuing ſoule) was the cauſe that Death reigned ouer all men; much more the reſurrection of Chriſt (who is a quickning ſpirit) ſhall be of power to raiſe vp all beleeuers, to the hope of a bleſſed and eternall life.
                     
                        
                           section 7 As Chriſt in dying ſhewed what we ſhould ſuffer; ſo by his riſing from death,Dan. 12.2. he declared what wee ſhould hope for: For all the bones in Golgatha ſhall riſe, and thoſe that ſleepe in the duſt, ſhall awake. Wherefore though Death doe ſwallow vs vp (as the Whale did Ionah,
                        Ionah. 1.17.) and binde vs hand and foot (as the Philiſtims did Sampſon;Iudg. 16.7.) yea ſeale the Sepulcher vpon vs (as the Iewes did vpon our Lord Ieſus:Mat. 27.60.65.66.) yet wee ſhall come forth, and breake the bands, (as the bird out of the ſnare,) the ſnare ſhall be broken,Eph. 4.8. Col. 2.15. and we ſhall be deliuered. Chriſt our head and Captaine raigneth now moſt gloriouſly in heauen, and as a moſt victorious conqueror, hath led away captiue, Death, Sinne, and Diuell, in ſhew and open triumph. Wherefore we may no leſſe aſſure our ſelues, that we ſhall riſe againe and raigne with God: for ſeeing he hath taken our fleſh, and ſuffered for our ſins, and hath borne the iudgement and curſe of God in himſelfe, and died for our redemption; ſo may we be as ſure and certaine our fleſh ſhall riſe againe in him, and be exalted vnto the glory of God, aboue the higheſt heauens:1 Cor. 15 20. And therefore hee is called the firſt fruits of them that ſleepe in him,Col. 1.18. & the firſt borne among the dead; ſo called indeede, becauſe hee is the firſt, and onely one which is riſen againe, by his owne diuine nature, and power: As the onely ſpring and originall fountaine

of the reſurrection of life, to all the faithfull, which die and riſe againe in him, and onely by him: Hee hath giuen vs a pledge, and taken one of vs, to put vs out of doubt. He hath taken our fleſh (which hee hath carried into heauen) to put vs in poſſeſſion; and he hath giuen vs his holy ſpirit for an earneſt, to ſeale his promiſes in our hearts, witneſſing to our ſpirit that we are the Sonnes of God, and co-heires with Ieſus Chriſt,Rom. 8.16.17. to raigne with him in glory.
                     Seeing then that wee are the children of God, and haue 
                           section 8 the ſeede of God remaining in vs; wee muſt not doubt, but that as Chriſt hath made vs partakers of his diuine nature (euen as it hath pleaſed him, to take part of ours,1 Ioh. 3.9. 2 Pet. 1.4. to become true man,) to make vs Gods, that is, diuine and ſpirituall;1 Cor. 15.36.42.43.44. that euen as the corne (that is ſowne in the ground) doth die in the ſame, and after groweth and taketh roote, ſpringeth, eareth, and bringeth forth fruit for the harueſt: ſo ſhould wee be well aſſured that when wee die, and haue our bodies ſowne (as it were) as ſeede in the earth, yet that they ſhall againe be quickned in Chriſt, and riſe againe to immortall life; for as much as we carry with vs, the warmeneſſe of Gods ſpirit, which cannot die.
                     And though our fleſh doe rot, yet ſhall the ſpirit of 
                           section 9 Chriſt deliuer our bodies from corruption, which ſhall againe be raiſed vp by the vertue of him that raiſed vp Chriſt from the dead, and ſo ſhall our dead members be made aliue againe. He that neuer ſaw a harueſt (ſeeing the Plow-man taking ſo much paines to till the earth, to ſpread it with dung, and after to caſt faire Wheate into the field) he would thinke that this man were mad; but ſeeing after the happy harueſt that ſhould come of it, he would change his minde, and ſay, that the husband-man had done an excellent worke. Now this life is the time to till, to dung, and to ſow the ſoyle; but the happy harueſt ſhall follow hereafter. Let vs not change the courſe of the ſeaſons, neither yet let vs ſeperate them the one from the other: But let vs ioyne the time of death, with the glorious day of our

reſurrection, and ſo aſſuring our ſelues, that hauing ſowed with teares,Pſal. 126.6. we ſhall reape with ioy.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. X. Very fruitfull and neceſſary conſiderations, much auailing to our Chriſtian preparation for death.
                     
                        
                           section 1
                        ANd to the end that we may be moſt chearfully reſolued to finiſh our courſe with ioy, let vs alienate our affections and thoughts from the earth, and worldly cares, hauing our whole ſoules and ſenſes (as much as in vs lieth rauiſhed with heauen and heauenly things. Let them be the matter of our ſpeech, the ſubiect of our thoughts, and our alone meditations; So ſhall we in time become diuine, and loath this ſinfull life: Let vs ſeriouſly make vſe of our knowledge and godly readings, ioyning our experience with the ſame, in our ſelues, and Gods Saints on earth: Let our skill herein not onely be contemplatiue, but practique, for the good of our ſelues.
                     
                        
                           section 2 Let vs not deſcant and diſcourſe (as carnall men can doe) for a time, which often can ſay and confeſſe that they are mortall and ſinfull, that they are but duſt and clay; and that their bodies are as tabernacles ſet vp for a time, and quickly to be remoued, being without foundation. Let vs not onely ſay (for faſhion ſake) that we are ſtrangers vpon the earth, and ſoiourners as all our Fathers were, &c. but be willing indeede (with good Abraham) when the Lord ſhall call and command vs, to leaue our owne country, and remoue our tents, to pitch them where hee pleaſeth: And ſo to follow him with all obedience, where he will leade vs.Heb. 11.8.9.10. He abode (ſaith the Apoſtle) in the land of promiſe (as in a ſtrange country, as one that dwelt in tents) for he looked for a citie hauing a foundation, whoſe builder and maker is God. And all the godly groane in theſe their earthly tabernacles (being laden with corruption) that this mortalitie may be ſwallowed vp of life,2 Cor. 5.2. for they know that corrupt fleſh & blood cannot enter into heauen.

Gods children (I ſay) are grieued, not becauſe they beare about their bodies (for it is a griefe for them to lay them downe,) but they ſigh to be clenſed from their ſinnes, and corruption of their bodies, which make them ſo wretched. We ought not therefore to long ſo much for this preſent life (which indeede is nothing elſe but an image of death) but rather loath it, to be vnloaden of our ſinnes.
                     And as for Death, it appertaineth to all men (as we haue 
                           section 3 heard;) for neither rich nor poore, old nor young, prince nor people, can eſcape it. It reſpecteth no mans perſon, no ſexe, no age, no condition whatſoeuer: No power, no wealth, no learning, no wiſedome, art,Ioſu. 23.14. Iob 30.23. or skill can auoide it: There is no ſalue to heale this ſoare, no Phyſicke to be found for this ſickneſſe, it is the way of all the world, and the houſe appointed for all the liuing: It is an Axe that heweth downe, not onely the low ſhrubs, and ſmall Oſiers, but the great Elmes and huge Oakes, yea, all the high and tall Cedars of Libanon. The daies of man are but as the winde, and weauers ſhittle, as graſſe and flowers, which in the morning are freſh and greene, but anone (towards the euening) dried vp and withered. We bring our yeares to an end, as it were a tale that is told. Our life is like a ſtage, on which men play their parts, and paſſe away: Man is like a thing of nought, his daies are like a ſhadow. God bids Eſay to cry, All fleſh is graſſe,
                        Eſay 40.6. 
                        and that all the grace and goodlineſſe thereof is but as a flower of the field. O that the Lord would open all our eyes, that in this glaſſe wee might behold our eſtate! What, are we all but graſſe? and ſhall we wither like hay? Alas, wee cannot ſo perſwade our ſelues, for (if we could) it would plucke downe our pride, and lay our lofty lookes: it would then reforme our diſguiſed ruffes, and make our monſtrous attire more modeſt: it would mitigate our madneſſe, and make vs humble minded: we would then throw downe our ſelues (with Abraham) and ſay to God, we are but duſt.Gen. 18.27.
                     
                     And to the end that our reſolution to death may be more chearefull, and this rough way (as it ſeemeth to the 
                           section 4 fleſh) may be made more plaine: Let vs comfort our ſelues

with theſe meditations, let vs ſay vnto our ſoule, why art thou ſo ſad?Pſal. 42.11. why art thou ſo vnquieted within vs? Put thy truſt in God, which is the helpe of our countenance, and our God? For why ſhould a Chriſtian man ſo feare the violence of Death, whoſe force is broken? Can Death depriue him of Chriſt, which is all his comfort, ioy and life? No, but Death ſhall deliuer him from this mortall body, full of ſinne and corruption, which beareth and beateth downe the ſoule. Faine would the fleſh make ſtrange of that which the ſpirit doth imbrace. Oh (ſaith a holy Martyr) how loath is this loytering ſluggard to paſſe forth, and goe forward in Gods path to heauen?
                        Saunders, Acts and Monuments. So that were it not through the force of Faith, plucking it forward, by the bridle of Gods ſweet promiſes, and of Hope (the anchor of ſaluation) pricking ſtill behinde, great aduenture there were of fainting by the way.
                     
                        
                           section 5 Who would be ſorry to forſake this life, which cannot but be moſt certain of eternall life? Who loueth the ſhadow better then the ſubſtance? who can ſo loue this life, but he that regardeth not the life to come? who can deſire the droſſe of this world, but ſuch as are ignorant of the true treaſure & euerlaſting ioyes in heauen? I meane, who is affraide to die, but ſuch as haue no hope to liue eternally? A greater aſſurance (next ſaith in Chriſt) of our election cannot be found, then not to ſtand in feare of Death, which (like a Tayler) putteth off our ouer-worne rags, to apparell vs with royall robes of immortalitie, incorruption, & glory. If the wals of thy houſe ſhake with age; if the roofe thereof totter; if the whole edifice (not being able any longer to ſtand) preſage a meere downefall and ruine to approach; wouldſt thou not make more then ordinary haſt to remoue and be gon? If thou wert ſayling in the maine ſea, and that a furious ſtorme (ſwelling the waues thereof, with the bluſtering windes) ſhould threaten thy ſhipwracke; wouldeſt thou not endeuour to recouer ſome cricke, or hauen? Behold this world, how it ſhaketh, and is ready to fall, manifeſting very ſhortly her vtter ruine: Wherefore thinkeſt thou not on God? why reioyceſt thou

not at thy condition, being ready to depart this world, ſeeing thy ſelfe taken betimes out of thoſe ſhipwracks, & warranted frō the blowes that threaten al ſuch as ſuruiue thee?
                     Wherefore (to the end that the former perſwaſions may 
                           section 6 better preuaile, & pierce the deeper) let vs further conſider (for the ſame, & abridgement of all that hath been hitherto ſpoken) what this life is, which wee ſo loue; what death is, which we now ſo feare; and what is prepared for vs after death, which we ſo little regard. Firſt, therefore concerning this preſent life, we know (and haue heard already) that it is full of miſerie, vanitie, vexation, & woe; being a plaine exile from God. For if heauen be our country, what is this earth, but a place of baniſhment? If the departing out of this world, be an entrance into life; what is this world, but a graue wherein we are buried? what is it elſe, but to be drowned in death? If to be deliuered out of the body, is to be ſet at liberty, what is this body elſe but a priſon, a Iayle, and a dungeon? If to enioy the ſweet fellowſhip of God be the higheſt felicitie, why then to be kept from it, is it not the extreameſt miſery? for certainly til we be eſcaped out of this life, we wander, & goe aſtray from the Lord our God. If we conſider that this vnſtedfaſt, faulty, corruptible, frayle, withering, & rotten tabernacle of our body, is & ſhall therefore be diſſolued by death; that it may afterward be reſtored againe, vnto a ſtedfaſt, perfect, incorruptible, and heauenly glory; ſhall not faith compel vs feruētly to deſire that which nature feareth? If we conſider that by death, we are called out of baniſhment, to inhabit our country; yea, our heauenly country, ſhall we not reioyce and be glad therefore?
                     Alas this our wretched life is a vapour, a ſmoake, a ſhadow, a warfare, a wilderneſſe, and a vale of wretchedneſſe,
                           section 7 wherein wee are compaſſed (on euery ſide) with moſt fierce & fearefull foes. And ſhould we deſire to dwell here? ſhould we luſt and long to liue in this loathſome, and laborious life? ſhould wee wiſh to tarry in this miſerable wretchedneſſe? ſhould we take pleaſure to remaine in this ſo dangerous eſtate? Daniels denne is not ſo dreadfull, as this dungeon we dwell in. In this life, wee are daily challenged

of our deadly enemies, the diuell, the world, and the fleſh. Our owne ſins are as ſwords, to pierce our ſoules. Couetouſneſſe, vncleaneneſſe, anger, ambition, worldly luſts, and fleſhly thoughts doe fight againſt vs. Here we are vrged to curſe, to ſweare, to lye, &c. Who therefore would care for ſuch a ſeruice, after which damnation (without repentance) ſhall be our due? It is truely ſaid that counterfeit ſanctitie, is compound iniquitie; and that deceitfull felicitie is double miſerie: For if this ſinfull life would ſimply ſhew itſelfe (without diſſembling) we would not ſo lightly looſe our ſoules for the loue thereof: But ſee how it deceiueth vs? being ſoule and filthy, it is ſold for beautifull, and faire; being ſhort it ſeemeth very long; and continually changing, it profeſſeth conſtancie.
                     
                        
                           section 8 Doſt thou perceiue (ſaith Ierome) when thou was made an infant? canſt thou tell how thou cameſt to be a ſtripling? or how thou greweſt to mans eſtate? or when thou beganſt to be an old man? That which we call life, is but a kinde of death, becauſe it maketh vs to die; and that which we account death, is the very birth of our true life; for that it maketh vs to liue eternally. Euill men are ſorry that this time of our preſent life paſſeth away ſo faſt, but the godly deſire to be where time paſſeth not all. And though we make neuer ſo much of our bodies (to keepe them in health and life) yet can we not long containe them from corruption, though we feede them moſt finely, and cloath them moſt coſtly, and cheriſh them moſt carefully; yet at the laſt they will become a thing of naught▪ their beautie ſhall fade, and they ſhall be deformed, their ſtrength taken away, their agilitie loſt, yea, all their parts ſhall periſh, and fall away like duſt: He that knew them before, would neuer iudge that duſt and earth, to haue beene the fleſh, blood, and bones, of a liuing man. Euery mans life, is like a rocke in the ſea, beaten vpon by the floods, on euery ſide; and like a tree on a high & open hill, blowne vpon by the windes from euery quarter: and like vnto a But, or marke, vnto which, ſorrow ſhoots, miſaduenture ſhoots, and at laſt Death (that moſt ſure Archer) ſhoots, and ſtrikes it dead.
                     
                        Thou that floweſt with wealth, and glorieſt in reputation, wilt thou know thy waight?Pſal. 144.34. & 39.5. thou art lighter then vanitie, then nothing. Wilt thou know the length of thy dayes? they are but a hand-breadth. Wilt thou know how and in what ſort thou fadeſt?Eſa, 40.6.7. as a ſlender picture or Image. And though one hearbe be ſweeter then another, of more vertue then another; and one flower of more indurance then another: yet at laſt all hearbes ſhall wither, and all flowers fade: So one man may be wiſer then another, and richer then another, and learneder then another, and more honourable then another, and ſtronger then another, &c. but the ſtate and condition of all fleſh is to be miſerable and mortall. Marke how huge and ſtately the vapours appeare,Iam. 4.14. (when they mount vpward vnto the heauen,) and yet how ſoone they vaniſh, in the turning of a hand: Such is this life, though it decke it ſelfe with neuer ſo glorious pompe, yet it fals away as a bubble. Our life is compared to a toppe (which children whirle and driue to and fro with the ſcourge) it is toſſed vp and downe, forward and backward,

                         and when it ſeemes to ſtand conſtantly, it fals ſodainely.
                     A ſtranger or a traueller, hath little or no contentation,
                           section 10 till hee come to the end of his iourney: Eyther hee complaines of the raine, or of the winde, or of the heat of the Sunne, or of his lodging, or of his dyet, or ſomething or other: So man hath ſtill occaſion to complaine of his troubles in this life (and can neuer inioy ſecuritie) while hee remaineth here. For as noyſome and peſtilent beaſts, ſeeke after their prey, and ſurceaſe not till they haue found it: So miſeries continually hunt after poore miſerable man, and Death it ſelfe at length doth greedily deuoure him.
                           Baſil in Pſal. 45 Greg. in Iob, c. 28 All the ioy (the godly haue in this life) is as a ſowre grape gathered out of time: And the Children of God here, not onely in ſorrow, but euen in ioy, ſhall ſomtimes ſhed forth teares. Here the ſweet Eaſter-Lambe muſt be eaten with ſowre hearbes.Exod. 12.8: 
                        
                           Ambroſe.
                         The godly (ſaith one) finding no ioy in the earth, haue their conuerſation in heauen, and Sathan finding no ioy in hell, hath his conuerſation in

the earth: So that the earth is a hell to vs, but a heauen to him. One deſired God to ſpare him a little, that hee might weepe for his miſery and griefe, thinking (as it ſeemeth) that a man could not haue time enough in this life, (though neuer ſo long) to lament and rue the miſeries of this life,
                           Bernard.
                         though neuer ſo ſhort. This life (ſaid Bernard) is a moſt dead and mortall life; that by how much the more it increaſeth, by ſo much the more it decayeth; which the farther it proceedeth, the nearer it approacheth to death.
                     
                     
                        
                           section 11 This life is like a cloud in the element, whereof wee are vncertaine where and when it falleth. This cloud of life ſometime melteth in the cradle, ſomtime in the bed, ſometime in the chayre, ſometime in the houſe, ſometime in the field, &c. And Death is like the Sunne, whenſoeuer it ſhineth, it ſurely melteth this cloudie life, be the cloud thereof neuer ſo thick, or thin in yeares. Our life is an vncertaine Weather-cocke, which turneth at euery blaſt; like a waue that walloweth at euery ſtorme; like a Reede that yeeldeth at euery whiſtling winde. It is a ſea of miſeries, wherein wee paſſe away the wandring dayes of this vncertaine life; ſayling (like Pilgrimes) on the waters of this world, toſſed by the tempeſts of aduerſities, and oppreſſed by ſundry Pirats, the Fleſh, World, and Diuell. And yet by the Bark of a liuely faith in Chriſt, (and by the Mariner Death) wee ſhall be tranſported to the heauenly hauen of reſt. Many yet (amidſt the miſeries of this life) are like Ionah vnder the hatches,Ionah 5.6. when others cry and are affraid of drowning, they lye ſnorting and ſleeping in the ſea of their ſinnes. Here we are continually ſubiect to feare, anguiſh, and ſorrow, and death it ſelfe, lyes euer in Ambuſh for vs; but when we are in heauen it ſhall haue no place.
                     
                        
                           section 12 Secondly, concerning Death (as we haue partly heard) what is it now elſe to the faithfull, but an angry waſpe without a ſting, a ſword without an edge, a dagger without a poynt? What other thing is it (to all Gods Children) then the diſpatcher of all diſpleaſures, the end of all trauels, the dore of heauen, the gate of gladneſſe, the port of Paradiſe, the hauen of health, the rayle of reſt, the

entrance to felicitie, the end of all miſery, and the beginning of all bleſſedneſſe? It is the very bed of Downe (ſaith one, and therefore well compared to a ſleepe) for the dolefull bodies of Gods ſeruants to reſt on, out of the which they ſhall ariſe, and awake moſt freſh and luſty, to euerlaſting life. It is a paſſage to the Father, a chariot to heauen, the Lords meſſenger, a leader vnto Chriſt, a going to our home, a deliuerance from bondage and priſon, a dimiſſion from warre, a ſecuritie from all ſorrowes, and a manumiſſion from all miſeries. It is the fulfilling of our pilgrimage, the laying downe of our burden (being loaden) the lighting from a wilde and furious horſe; a diſpoſſeſſing of our ſelues from an old ruinous houſe, it is the eſcaping of all dangers, the waſting and diruption of all euils, the payment of our naturall debt, the end of our race and iourney, and our entrance into glory.
                     Wherefore though Death in it ſelfe, be as a fiery Dragon,
                           section 13 venemous Cockatrice, and ſtinging Serpent, for poore Chriſtians to behold (in outward ſhew and ſhape,) yet now through Chriſt (who hath conquered it) it can neuer preuaile againſt vs to ouercome vs. For as a Bee without a ſting may be put into the boſome, ſo need wee not to feare to meete with death. Serpent ſtill ſhee may ſeeme in ſight (to the outward man) yet voyd of poyſon ſhee is to the man of God. Fight it may againſt vs, but neuer be able to foyle vs; nay, rather it deliuereth vs from a thouſand dangers. The Souldier though hee be neuer ſo expert in his weapons, yet ſtill hee deſireth the end of warre, to inioy the triumph of his fight, and alwayes preferreth the comfortable league of peace, before the Pikes. The Mariner, though hee delight and loue to ſaile on the ſeas, yet ſtill hee perſwadeth himſelfe the ſhoare to be the ſafeſt; and there is no Countrey ſo comfortable to the traueller, as is his natiue ſoyle. If a man were ſhut vp in a miſerable darke priſon, with condition hee ſhould not come forth till the wals of the tower were fallen downe, would hee not reioyce to ſee them ruinous and ready to fall? Now our ſoule is kept in the body (as in a priſon,

in captiuitie and bands) and when by death it beginnes to be ſhaken, and cannot chooſe but fall, ſhall we be ſorry? For then indeede approacheth our deliuerance and freedome from all ſinne and miſery, and preſently wee are brought to the ioyfull fruition of God himſelfe, and all happineſſe.Eccleſ. 7.2. So that this day of death is better then the day of birth: yea, this day (which thou feareſt to be thy laſt) ſhall be thy natiuitie to euerlaſting life.
                     And indeede we cannot make the world to dye in vs, 
                           section 14 except we dye our ſelues. Sinne, which is in vs, liueth in vs, and fighteth againſt vs, vntill we dying, it alſo dye with vs, and by death alone, the deadly aſſaults of Sathan (our chiefe enemy) dye forthwith. Yet for all this, the laſt day of our life, is vnto vs alwayes the firſt day to life, though we neuer account the firſt day to be the laſt. The things that God will haue come to paſſe (ſaith one) are alwayes ſpringing, and things preſent doe alwayes decay and periſh. Thoſe things that are paſt, are cleane dead and conſumed. We then are dying while we liue, and then doe we ceaſe from dying, when we doe ceaſe to liue. Therefore it is better to dye alwayes, to liue; then to liue to dye euer. One ſaith well to this purpoſe, that life and death haue deceiuable vizards, but let vs caſt them off, and wee ſhall change our mindes: when vnder the fayre forme of life, there is nothing but matter of griefe, and vnder the foule and hideous maske of death, ſuch beauty and felicitie, as we ſhall preſently be taken with her loue.
                     The way of this life is ſtraite and narrow, full of thornes 
                           section 15 and bryers, that we cannot eſcape ſcratching: The way to Canaan is cumberſome, ouer hils and mountaines, and lyeth through the wilderneſſe, where we ſhall finde many wants: yet may we not be diſcouraged, but the rather be aſſured wee are going to the promiſed Land. We muſt all arriue at the port of death, and land at his ſtayres, when wee paſſe from this life to our graues, where the body abideth the time of the reſtauration of all things; that (with all the coheyres of Chriſt) we may enter into the Land of promiſe. And who being a traueller in forraine parts

would not gladly haſten homewards?
                           Cyprian de mort.
                         who would not willingly ſayle to his friends, and deſire a luſty gale of winde to ſpeede him, that he might ſooner ſee the faces of his deareſt kindred? If wee looke for our felicitie here, we are deceiued: Elias muſt goe to heauen in a whirle-winde:2 Kings 2.11. God will ſend Iacob an Angell of comfort in his iourney, (after all his troubles with Laban) and God will bring him home with abundance of increaſe at the laſt.Gen. 31.11.12.
                     
                     When old Iacob ſaw the chariots of Egypt, then he perceiued 
                           section 16 his ſonne Ioſeph was aliue,Gen. 45.27.28. then his fainting ſpirit reuiued; I will goe ſee him (ſaid hee) before I dye. Our true Ioſeph liueth (euen Ieſus our Sauiour) and ſeeing wee can not ſee him liuing, let vs willingly goe by the chariots of death. Since man cannot ſee God and liue, let me dye (O Lord) that I may ſee thee. When we are borne (ſaith one) wee are mortall,
                           Auguſt.
                         but when wee are once dead wee become immortall. We are aliue in the wombe, to die in the world; but wee are dead in the graue to liue in heauen. Here the ſoules of Gods children are pent and pind (within the clayie, wals of their corruptible bodies) where they may looke (as it were) thorow the yron grates of their buſie thoughts, but can neuer quite be releaſed, till that God (who gaue vs our Mittimus into this layle) ſend vs our deliuery, with a Returne yee ſonnes of Adam.
                        Pſal. 90.3.
                     
                     To be ſhort, what other thing is this death, but after a 
                           section 17 long conflict the day of victory; the birth of a bleſſed ſoule, after a great trauell (as it were) in childe-birth; the healing of all wounds and ſickneſſes; the deliuerance from all feare; the accompliſhing of our ſanctification; the day of our marriage with the Lambe, and the enioying of our deſires? Who is it then among vs (who feeling with S. Paul, the bondage of ſin) would not alſo cry out with him; Who ſhall deliuer mee from this body of death?
                        Rom. 7.24. And feeling the good (that death bringeth vnto vs) will not alſo deſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt?
                        Phil. 1.23. Death and Life are as two twins, vnited and knit together, vntill the ſeperation of the ſoule and the body, which ſeperation is called Death; and is rather indeede the deadly ſtroake of

The very Pagans in ſome places (as it is recorded) did celebrate the day of their death, with mirth, melodie, and minſtrelcie; and ſhall wee that are Chriſtians be ſo diſmaid, and caſt downe? ſhould ſuch a friend as it is be vnwelcome? ſhall the fouleneſſe of his face, feare vs from his good conditions? ſhall the hardneſſe of the huske hinder vs from the ſweetneſſe of the kirnell? ſhall the roughneſſe of the tide, feare vs from the banke, and ſhoare, and ſo hazard our drowning; rather then the deſire of our home, driue vs to the land with all expedition? ſhall the hardneſſe of the ſaddle, ſet vs on foote, to ſlacken our voyage; rather then wee will leape vp, and endure the ſame a little, and ſo come ſwiftly to the place wee doe deſire?
                     
                        
                           section 18 Laſtly, touching the heauenly life (prepared for the faithfull after death,) if I ſhould goe about to expreſſe it, the more I ſhould ſo doe, the further I ſhould be from it; ſo farre exceeding the ſight, thought, or conceit of man or any creature.Apoc. 21.3. &c. 
                        Behold (ſaith Saint Iohn) the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and he their God, and he ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, nor ſorrow, nor crying, nor paine, (for the former things are paſt.) O moſt bleſſed tabernacle? O moſt ſafe refuge! O region moſt reſplendant and glorious! All thy inhabitants weare crownes of glory; ſit in thrones of maieſtie, liue in life eternall, and poſſeſſe a paradiſe of infinite pleaſures. Which (as Saint Bernard ſaith) are ſo many, that they cannot be numbred; of ſuch eternitie, that they are endleſſe; ſo precious as they cannot be eſtimated, and ſo great as they cannot be meaſured. This Citie is made of pure gold, the very wals of precious ſtones; hauing twelue foundations, made of twelue diſtinct precious ſtones, hauing twelue gates ſet with pearles, the very ſtreetes paued with gold, & interlaied with precious ſtones:

The light of this citie is Chriſt (in his ſhining brightneſſe) ſitting in the midſt thereof; from whoſe ſeate proceedeth the water of life, and there growes the tree of life, bearing continuall fruit, for the continuall refection of the Saints. There is no night in that citie, nor any defiled thing, but they which are within, ſhall raigne for euer in vnſpeakeable glory, who ſhine as the Sunne in the Kingdome of their Father.
                     If one Sunne can lighten and fill the whole world with 
                           section 19 his brightnes; if the Maieſtie & glory of his beames be ſuch, and ſo great, that ſome Ethnicks haue worſhipt him for a God; and haue called him the father of gladnes; the eye of the world, and the fountaine of light:Dan. 12.3. Mat. 13.43. What ſhall ſo many glorified bodies of the bleſſed appeare, that ſhall be as ſo many Sunnes, ſo many Lampes, and ſo many ſhining lights in heauen? Then ſhall we be bleſſed indeede, when we ſhall be like vnto God, which by nature is bleſſed; and we ſhall be like vnto God when we ſhall ſee him as hee is:1 Ioh. 3.2. For this onely ſight of God, is our whole happineſſe.1 Cor. 13.12. O what a ioy ſhall it be, when (at one view) we ſhall behold the moſt high and hidden miſterie of the inſeparable trinitie, and of the loue of God therein? For what ſhall not he ſee, who ſeeth him that ſeeth all things? Then ſhall mans minde haue perpetuall reſt and peace; neither ſhall it deſire any further vnderſtanding, when hee hath all before his eyes, that may be vnderſtood. Then ſhall mans will be quiet, when he enioyeth that felicitie, wherein all other good things (as in the fountaine of all happineſſe) are contained: Then ſhall Faith haue her perfect worke, & Hope ſhall inioy that which ſhe long deſired, but Charitie ſhall indure for euer. Then ſhall be ſung continuall praiſes vnto the Lambe,Apoc. 14.3. & the ſong (although it be alwaies ſung) yet it ſhall be euer new. The ioy, mirth, melodie, pleaſure, power, wealth, riches, honour, beautie, fellowſhip, dainties, odors, glory, wiſedome, knowledge, treaſures, ſecurities, peace, quietneſſe, and eternall felicitie, is beyond all vnderſtanding, and comprehenſion of man; which the faithfull ſhall haue and inioy world without end, with God the Father,

the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt; with Angels, and Arkangels, Patriarks, and Prophets; with the Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts; with the Martyrs, and Confeſſors, and with the Saints of God, in the pallace of the Lord; in heauen, the kingdome of God, the glory of the Father; Where there ſhall be an euerlaſting Saboath, which no euening ſhall end.

                        is without end; for what other end is there ordained for the godly, but to attaine to that kingdome which hath no end? Wee call Paradiſe our Country, and the Patriarks our Fathers, and the Saints our brethren and friends: Why runne we not then (with all ſpeede) to enioy our Country, and to ſalute our Parents? A great number of our friends and kinsfolkes, brethren and children, already aſſured of their immortalitie, and deſirous of our good, doe there attend, wiſhing and expecting our comming:

                         What ioy will it be both to them and vs, there to renew our acquaintance, and meete one another? What pleaſures are there amongſt the inhabitants of heauen, which now feare death no more, and are ſure to liue for euer? Woe to the blindneſſe of our eyes, that ſee not this: woe to the hardneſſe of our hearts, that feele not this: woe to the deafeneſſe of our eares, that heare not, this in ſuch wiſe as we ſhould do, where through we might be ſo farre from fearing death, that rather wee ſhould wiſh it, with old Simeon, Now let thy ſeruant depart in peace:
                        Luk. 2.29. Pſal. 42.2. and (with Dauid,) when ſhall I come and appeare before thee?
                     
                     
                        
                           section 21 If true knowledge and faith poſſeſt our hearts (as they ſhould) feare and doubtfulneſſe would vaniſh quite away: For aſſurance of heauenly things, maketh vs willing to part with earthly. Hee cannot contemne this life, that knoweth not the other. If wee would diſpiſe this world, we muſt thinke of heauen: If wee will make death eaſie, we muſt thinke of the glorious life that followeth it: And if we can endure paine for health, much more ſhould wee

abide a few pangs for glory? How fooliſh are wee to feare a vanquiſhed enemie? Chriſt hath triumphed ouer death, it bleedeth (as it were) and gaſpeth vnder vs, and yet doe we tremble? It is enough that Chriſt died, neither would he haue died, but that we might die with ſafetie and pleaſure. How truely may wee ſay of this our Dauid, thou art worth ten thouſand of vs, yea worth a world of Angels? yet he died, and died for vs. Who would therefore liue, that knowes his Sauiour died? Who can be a Chriſtian, and would not be like him, that would not die after him? Thinke of this, and iudge whither all the world can hire vs not to die.
                     But (alas) great is our vnbeliefe, full faint and weake is our faith; or elſe night and day, teares and cryes, ſhould 
                           section 22 be our meate and drinke: whilſt the wicked ſay vnto vs,Pſal. 42.3. 
                        where is now your God? we ſhould wiſh rather to be doore-keepers (in the houſe of God) then to dwell in theſe vngodly tents: For one day in his courts,Pſal. 84.10. is better then a thouſand. It is a token of little loue to God, to be ſo loath to goe vnto him, when he calleth. Herein we ought to lament the weakeneſſe of our faith, and ſeeing our wants, to prepare for remedie, againſt the time of neede: and to beg of God, his aide, ſtrength, and comfort againſt the pinch: which things vndoubtedly (if we aske in faith) we ſhall obtaine, and finde his promiſe true. God reacheth out his hand to conduct vs; but wee draw backe our owne, and runne away, when hee calleth vs. If hee bring vs into the way of ſaluation,Gen. 19.26. wee mourne for the world, we looke behinde vs (with Lots wife) and procraſtinate our deſire of well doing. We muſt therefore rouze vp our ſelues, and not remaine ſt
                           •
                        ll in the mire: wee muſt be fortified in his vertue, who ſupporteth and comforteth vs in all diſtreſſe.
                     Let vs attempt to deſpiſe corruptible things, and to deſire heauenly and eternall. When God calleth, at euery 
                           section 23 occaſion, let vs harken vnto him; if he be our guide, we muſt follow him for to arriue in his houſe. Let vs receiue his benefit, and himſelfe too, for hee giues himſelfe vnto

vs, in the perſon of his Sonne. Hee cauſeth vs to ſee the meanes how to come vnto him. Wee muſt therefore requeſt him to beſtow vpon vs will and deſire to come thither by Faith, Repentance, Hope, &c. and that hee would maintaine his gifts and graces in vs to the end; that here wee may mourne in this mortall life, and attend (in the aſſurance of his mercy) for the end of this world, and our laſt day, which ſhall be the beginning of our true life. Beſeeching God our heauenly Father, (for his Son Chriſt his ſake) to keepe vs ſoules and bodies, to his kingdome and glory, and to lead vs, order vs, and diſpoſe of vs, as hee will, in all things, in all places, and for euer; that at the length, we may come whither we would, that is, into his owne bleſſed preſence and fruition of immortality, with Chriſt and his Saints, world without end. Amen.

                  TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL AND VERTVOVS LADY, THE LADY ELIZABETH TVRPIN, Wife to the Right Worſhipfull and worthy Knight Sr. WILLIAM TVRPIN, his approued kinde Patrone, &c. the increaſe of all outward bleſſings and ſpirituall comforts, be multiplyed and increaſed, through IESVS CHRIST.

maturely to be publiſhed, if the vnexpected ſpeedineſſe of the Preſſe had not preuented me. Howſoeuer, my hearts deſire is, and (I truſt) ſhall ſo continue, to glorifie God in my calling, and to profit his Church by any lawfull and hopefull meanes, to the vttermoſt period of my dayes. Theſe infallible comforts of Gods word and faithfull prayer (ſo approued and experienced to euery true Chriſtian heart) I commend vnto your good Ladiſhip; whoſe vſe (by Gods bleſſing) may ſted you with others, hauing your portion (no doubt) and lot of Tryals in this prouoking world, (a very furnace of afflictions) to all Gods children. I can promiſe little, being the meaneſt of Gods Miniſters: Yet will I pray (as my purpoſe was) that it may proue profitable to your ſelfe, and ſuch as ſhall reade it, for the increaſe of true patience, comfort, & Chriſtian courage, that we all may fight the good fight of faith, and finiſh our courſe with ioy, and ſo be crowned. I write vnto you as no ſtranger to my Miniſtery, who often haue heard (vpon occaſion) the handling of theſe poynts in the

publike place: Now onely I intreat your fauourable acceptance and patronage hereof, as the meaneſt requitall of your manifolde kindneſſes; And ſo commending your Ladiſhip to Gods bleſſing and protection, I humbly take my leaue: From my poore ſtudie in Shearsby. Feb. 8. 1616.

                  The principall poynts of doctrine, contayned in both the SERMONS.
                  
                     
                        The Doctrines of the firſt SERMON. PSAL. 199.92.93.
                        
                           GOd alwaies prouideth meanes to keepe his children from diſtreſſe, in their greateſt tryalls and afflictions.
                        
                           Doct. 1
                        
                        The excellent vſe and profit of Gods word, being able (through his bleſsing) to keepe vs vpright in our wayes, and from falling away from God, in our greateſt tryals and temptations.
                        
                           2
                        
                        Gods word cannot ſimply profit vs, and keepe vs from periſhing in our afflictions, except we take ioy and comfort in the ſame.
                        
                           3
                        
                        The beſt men, and excellenteſt creatures, are not able of themſelues to ſtand and continue vpright in their tryals and temptations, without Gods ſpeciall prouidence and prouiſion in the meanes.
                        
                           4
                        
                        It is the dutie of euery Chriſtian to remember the meanes of their comfort and deliuerance from their former troubles and afflictions, and to be carefull to vſe the ſame againe, as occaſion ſerueth.
                        
                           5
                        
                        
                           It is peculiar and proper to Gods word alone, to cheare the heart in afflictions, and to quicken and reuiue the ſoule in the greateſt extremities.
                        
                           6
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        The Doctrines of the ſecond Sermon. LAMENT. 3.55.56.57.58.
                        
                           TRue and faithfull prayer is a moſt ſoueraigne meanes and remedie for comfort and deliuerance in, and from our greateſt diſtreſſes.
                        
                           Doct. 1
                        
                        True and faithfull prayer muſt bee made and directed to God alone.
                        
                           2
                        
                        True and effectuall prayer is and muſt be grounded vpon the aſſured knowledge of Gods name and power.
                        
                           3
                        
                        There is no outward condition of life ſo miſerable, or affliction ſo grieuous, which the deareſt children of God are not ſubiect vnto in this world.
                        
                           4
                        
                        This is one fruit and effect of ſinne, that it ſtoppeth the paſſage of our prayers, and hindreth Gods bleſsings from vs.
                        
                           5
                        
                        Afflictions not onely ſtirre vp men to prayer, but alſo make their prayers more feruent and effectuall.
                        
                           6
                        
                        Gods children neuer pray in vaine, but are heard and helped of God in their greateſt afflictions.
                        
                           7
                        
                        
                           The experience of Gods loue in our former deliuerances out of danger, ought ſtill to encourage vs to reſort vnto him, when the like or greater troubles ſhall againe aſſaile vs.
                        
                           8
                        
                        God is ſtill ready, and at hand, to comfort and relieue his children in their greateſt dangers.
                        
                           9
                        
                        God will maintaine and vphold the righteous cauſe of his ſeruants, whatſoeuer be their dangers.
                        
                           10
                        
                        There is nothing (many times) more dangerous in the world, then to defend and maintaine the truth of God.
                        
                           11
                        
                        God not onely maintaineth the cauſe, but preſerueth the perſons of his ſeruants, (in their greateſt perils) that defend his truth.

                  The firſt SERMON.
                  
                     
                        
                           PSALME 119.92.93.
                        
                        Except thy law had beene my delight, I ſhould now haue periſhed in my affliction. I will neuer forget thy precepts, for by them thou haſt quickened me.
                     
                  
                  
                     THe ſumme of this Pſalme is the Prophet Dauids long and earneſt ſuite to GOD,The ſcope and drift of the whole Pſalme. to be fully informed in the ſound and ſauing knowledge of his word. The excellent fruits and effects whereof, he relateth and inlargeth (wellnigh) in euery verſe; and profeſſeth to haue found and felt the ſweetneſſe, power, and efficacy thereof, not onely for his daily vſe and inſtruction (in that his changeable, fraile, and weake eſtate then liuing) but for the aſſurance of Gods loue, and truth of his promiſes, to be accompliſhed, and performed to him, and all the elect in the life to come.
                  Now in theſe two Verſes he ſpeaketh of his afflictions, ſo great and grieuous, confeſſing that he had periſhed except Gods law had been his delight. His meaning is,The ſenſe. hee had miſcarried in his troubles, had not the ioy and comfort he receiued from Gods word (teaching him to relye vpon his ſpeciall prouidence and promiſes) farre ſurmounted

and exceeded his worldly ſorrows, ſo ſore oppreſſing him; and that indeede he had dyed, and vtterly periſhed, had he not beene quickened and recouered by the vertue thereof; and therefore reſolueth neuer to forget that moſt comfortable and ſoueraigne meanes of Gods word, ſo relieuing and reſtoring him in his diſtreſſe.
                  
                     Diuiſion.The words in effect offer vnto vs, firſt, Davids confeſſion; and ſecondly, Dauids reſolution: with a ſeuerall reaſon annexed to the one, and to the other. His confeſſion, that he had periſhed in his affliction. The reaſon why hee did not, was the ioy and delight that was miniſtred vnto him from Gods law. Secondly, his reſolution, that Hee will neuer forget Gods precepts; the reaſon is, For by them thou haſt quickened me, being out of heart and hope in his owne conceipt.
                  
                     Summe.The ſubſtance and ſumme of all, is briefly this: That Dauid could neuer haue endured the extremitie of his croſſes, had not the word of God comforted and confirmed him in his faith and reſolution, to depend vpon God. But before we proceed to particular inſtructions let vs in a word conſider the variety of Names and Titles he giueth to Gods word in this Pſalme,The manifold names of Gods word, with the reaſon. and the reaſon thereof. Hee calleth it hereby the name of Law, and precepts; and in other places, Statutes, Commandements, Ceremonies, Iudgements, Counſell, &c. The reaſon is, to expreſſe the excellent vſe thereof to euery Chriſtian, and to teach euery man not lightly to eſteeme of the Scriptures, (as words of liberty and licentiouſneſſe) but ſuch as exact obedience at our hands, and binde vs with a penalty (as ſure as any law or ſtatute) to performe our duties. And that we cannot do, iudge, counſel, reſolue, or be warranted of the lawfulnes of our actions, without the direction thereof. And this is proper to the whole word of God, both in the Olde and New Teſtament. Hitherto for the information of our knowledge, for the Text it ſelfe: our further inſtruction for the Chriſtian vſe thereof, followeth.
                  
                     
                        Text.
                     
                     Except thy law had beene my delight I had periſhed, that is,

if thy word had not beene prouided as a meanes and remedy of comfort, I had beene ſwallowed vp with deſpaire: Whence firſt ariſeth this inſtruction.
                  That God alwaies prouideth meanes to keepe his children 
                        doctrine 1 from diſtreſſe, in their trials and afflictions.God alwaies prouideth for his children in their greateſt extremities. 
                     Dauid had periſhed in his troubles, if Gods law had not comforted him. But Gods word brought ioy and delight to his afflicted ſoule, therefore he periſhed not.
                  Chriſt, ſpeaking of the deſtruction of Hieruſalem, and of the laſt and worſt daies, before the conſummation of the world:Mat 24.21.22. And hauing amplified the dangers thereof (eſpecially amongſt the Iewes) by many circumſtances, hee addeth, that the tribulation ſhall be ſuch, as was not from the beginning of the world to that time, nor ſhould bee hereafter (being indeed beyond the compaſſe of all compariſon,) and concludeth, That except thoſe dayes ſhould bee ſhortened, no fleſh ſhould be ſaued: Yet for the elect ſake (ſayth Chriſt) thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortned.
                     Exod. 1.11.12.13.14. So Iſraell in Egipt (that houſe of bondage and furnace of afflictions) was made to ſerue with ſore labour in Bricke and Clay, and all manner of worke in the field, being wearie of their liues, beſides the hard vſage of their taske-maſters, and what miſchiefe elſe could bee deuiſed by the Diuell and Pharaoh, vtterly to roote them out, yet the more they vexed them, the more they grew. Their eſtate is well reſembled by the buſh that burned and yet was not conſumed:Exod. 3.3. As their enemies deuiſed to doe them h
                        •
                     rt, ſo God deuiſed to doe them good, Who knoweth (as Saint Peter ſpeaketh) to deliuer the godly out of tentation,
                     2 Pet. 2.9. 
                     and to reſerue the vniuſt vnto the day of iudgement. I cannot reckon vp the croſſes of this people, after their deliuerance out of Egipt. See the Catalogue thereof in the Pſalmes, They wandred in the Deſert,
                     Pſal. 107. throughout. 
                     both hungrie and thirſtie, with fainting ſoules: They dwelt in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, being bound in miſery and iron: Their hearts were humbled with heauineſſe, and there was no helper: Their ſoule abhorred all meate, and they were brought to deaths

dore: Yet, when they cryed to God in their trouble, he deliuered them out of their diſtreſſe. The miſeries of Gods children infflicted vpon them by Sathan and his inſtruments,The miſeries of Gods children cannot be more then the means of deliuerance, which he prouideth. cannot be ſo many as the meanes and remedies of comfort and deliuerance that God prouideth for them. See how the Church and children of God triumph and exult vpon the experience of this poynt. They haue oftentimes afflicted mee from my youth vp, (may Iſraell now ſay:) They haue oftentimes afflicted mee from my youth,
                     Pſal. 129.1.2.3. 
                     but they could not preuaile againſt me. The Plowers plowed vpon my backe, and made long furrowes, but the righteous Lord hath cut the cords of the wicked. Although God ſuffer his people to be vſed as the field that is plowed, and their enemies be as the ſtrong and luſty iades appoynted for the plough: Or as the ſtalled Oxen to breake vp the fallow ground, renting and tearing the furrowes of the ſame, and not leaue ſo much as a clod vnturned, but attempt all manner of wayes (euery way) to annoy them: Yet the iuſt God (moſt faithfull in his promiſes, and ſure in his iudgements) doth cut the cords, and breake the geares of theſe vnreſtie, fierce, and ſauage beaſts, diſappoynting the purpoſe of the greateſt tyrants in their extreameſt rage, and furie, and ſendeth his Children freedome and deliuerance in his due time. Iehoſhua, ſo admirably preſerued in that long captiuity of the Iewes (being as a brand taken out of the fire) arrayed with filthy rayment,Zach. 3.2.3.4.5 as one comming out of a dungeon: Yet the Lord cloatheth him with changeable garments, and ſetteth a Diadem vpon his head, and ſtill rebuketh Sathan that is about to hurt him in his perſon, and hinder him in the worke of his Miniſtery. And though his Children haue lyen among the pots,Pſal. 68.13. and beene vſed like Scullions; yet ſhall they bee like the Doue, whoſe Winges are couered with Siluer, and her feathers like yealow Gold: They ſhall come forth out of their aduerſitie moſt gliſtering and glorious, through the grace

and fauour that God will ſhew them.Gen. 37.20.24 28. & 39.20. & 41.40. & 42.6. 
                     Ioſeph was accuſed of his brethren, put into a pit, ſold as a ſlaue, ſlaundered for filthineſſe, and ſo committed to priſon as a guilty perſon: yet deliuered, and promoted to be Prince and ruler ouer all the Land of Egypt; to whom (afterward) his brethren bowed, and euery one did obeyſance. So they ſought an occaſion againſt Daniel, concerning the law of his God;Dan. 6.5.13.22 28. they cenſured him as a refractary man againſt King Darius, and his command: and ſo he was called, iudged, and committed to the Lyons denne; yet the Lord preſerued him aliue, and ſet him aloft, ouer all his aduerſaries. Mordecay was in diſgrace,Heſt. 3.8.12. & 9.1.2.3.5. and all the Iewes out of credite with King Ahaſhueroſh, by meanes of Haman (that curſed Amalekite) their liues bought and ſolde,Reade the particular meanes of their deliuerance in their ſtories. and their vtter deſtruction ſealed: yet were they all ſafely deliuered, and honoured in the ſight of their foes, whom they ſaw confounded. To omit Moſes, Ieremie, and the reſt of the Prophets; Paul Peter, & other of the Apoſtles, and holy men of God, together with the plots and deuiſes intended againſt them, their variety of perſecutions and troubles, ſo great and ſo grieuous, Yet the Lord deliuered them out of all. Therefore moſt true it is, that the Apoſtle Paul ſpeaketh of himſelfe,Pſal. 34.19. 2 Cor. 4.8.9. & gods Saints, We are afflicted on euery ſide, yet not in diſtreſſe; we are in doubt, but we deſpaire not; we are perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt downe, but we periſh not.
                  
                  Now, the reaſon of this doctrine is, firſt, that God is their 
                        reason 1 Creator, and therefore careth for them,God is their Creator. who cannot deſpiſe the leaſt worke of his hands. Thou Lord doſt ſaue both Man and Beaſt,
                     Pſal. 36.6.7.8. & 31.19.20. but how excellent is thy mercy (O God) to the children of men, that truſt vnder the ſhadow of thy wings? They ſhall be ſatisfied with the fatnes of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt giue them drinke out of the Riuers of thy pleaſures. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, We labour and are rebuked,
                     1 Tim 4.10. 
                     becauſe we truſt in the liuing God, which is the ſauiour of all men, ſpecially of thoſe that belieue. If there be no man (no not the wickedeſt) but he feeleth Gods goodneſſe towards him in his protection, and preſeruation: how much more Gods elect,

                     whoſe names are written in Heauen.
                     Luk. 10.20. Mal. 3.16. And which againe, they haue ſurrendred vnto him in a holy profeſſion of his truth, and ſuffering for the ſame.Luk. 12.6.7. 
                     Are not fiue Sparrowes bought for two farthings? and yet not one of them is forgotten before God. How farre more deare and pretious then are the liues ſafetie, and eſtates of Gods children, Whoſe very haires are numbred? Such ſhall be ſure of all outward helpes and meanes (ſo farre as is fit) and at the leaſt God will beſtow vpon them faith, hope, patience, conſolation, and conſtancie, (which are the beſt ſupplies) in all their neceſſities. Therefore, feare not, thou worme, Iacob, I will helpe thee (ſaith the Lord) and thy Redeemer,

His name is called vpon by them, they haue his word and his Sacraments, all his promiſes and aſſurances to be their God:Heb. 6.17.18. Ier. 14 9. Gal 6.10. Epheſ. 1.19. Eſa. 63.16. Mal. 3.6. Pſal. 23. Pſal. 100.3. Cant. 4.5 10.11 12. & 5.1. Gen. 17.1. They are of his houſhold and family, and ſo caſt vpon God to be cared for: He is their Father, and they his children: He is their ſhepheard, and they are his people, and ſheepe of his paſture. He is the husband of his elect, and they his Spouſe, who of right muſt defend and protect them, and therefore how can they miſcarry? All ſufficiency is in God, who hath vndertaken their protection; Power, and will, faithfulneſſe, truth, and vnchangeableneſſe, all the meanes that may be, meete and concurre in him that hath promiſed preſeruation, and how then ſhould he ſaile vs?

Heb. 3.8.9.10. who in their fits and feuers of afflictions, thinke all is gone; that murmure, grudge, and repine, with the vnbelieuing Iſraelites, at euery turne and tryall, tempting, and blaſpheming the Lord, ſhortning his hand that he cannot helpe, and making deafe his eare that he cannot heare. To which fault alſo the deareſt children of God are ſubiect. Dauid complaineth that hee was caſt out of

Gods ſight, That he had forgotten to be gracious,
                     Pſal. 77.8.9.10 
                     and that he had ſhut vp his louing kindneſſe in diſpleaſure.
                     Ier. 20.7. 
                     Ieremie chargeth God to haue deceiued him, That hee was a ſtranger in the Land, as one that paſſeth by to tarry for a night:
                     Ier. 14.8.9. 
                     Why art thou (ſaith he) as a man aſtonyed, and as a ſtrong man that cannot helpe? But it is their great infirmity ſo to thinke; for God is conſtant in his care and vnchangeable in his loue. Can a woman forget her childe,
                     Eſay 49.15.16. 
                     and not haue compaſſion vpon the ſonne of her wombe? Though ſhe ſhould forget, yet I will not forget thee. Behold, I haue grauen thee vpon the palmes of my hands:
                     Ier. 22.24. Pſal 121.4. Such are, as a ſignet on his right hand, and as a girdle wherewith he it girded: He neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth that keepeth his Iſraell. And albeit our ſinnes make a ſeparation betweene God and vs,Eſay 49.1. Lam. 3.9.44. building (as it were) a bulwarke of hewen ſtones to ſtop vp our wayes, and cauſe him to couer himſelfe as with a cloude, that our prayers can haue no paſſage; and make him to returne to his place,Hoſea 5.15. & 6.1.2. as one that will not be ſpoke withall, nor intreated: Yet, if we acknowledge our faults, and in our afflictions ſeeke diligently vnto him, hee will then be found: After two dayes will he reuiue vs, and in the third day he will raiſe vs vp, and we ſhall liue in his ſight.
                     Pſal. 30.5. 
                     Our heauineſſe may endure for a night, but ioy ſhall come in the morning. Though for a moment he hide his face from vs, for a little ſeaſon, yet with euerlaſting mercy he will haue compaſſion on vs.

                        vse 2 to be of Gods familie and houſhold, for then wee cannot want his protection, ayde and aſſiſtance.Heb. 6.17.18. Gen. 17.7. If wee be within his Couenant he hath ſworne not to forſake vs; if we be his people, he will be our God. We muſt keepe our ſelues in his folde, (as good ſheepe walking in his wayes) and then he will heede vs. If we wander like the prodigall,Luke 15. we ſhall waſte our goods, and want, vntill we haſten home. If wee will haue the priuiledge of his Sonnes, wee muſt honour him as our Father, and if we will be his Spouſe,Mal. 16. 1 Pet. 1.17. Epheſ. 4.24. Gen. 20.16. we muſt be loyall onely vnto him, and not fall in loue with others: So will hee be our vaile againſt the heate of afflictions, our ſhield and defence againſt all our enemies, and ſtill preſerue

and deliuer vs from all extremities and diſtreſſes.
                  
                     
                        vse 3 Againe, it muſt ſtirre vs vp to thankefulneſſe and praiſe for our deliuerance. How often therefore is the Church of the Iewes incited in the Pſalmes, to take vp this note of Praiſe (as the burden of their Song?) Let them therefore (ſaith the Prophet) confeſſe before the Lord his louing kindnes,
                     Pſal. 107.8.15.21.31.32. 
                     and his wonderfull workes before the Sonnes of men: And let them offer ſacrifices of praiſe, and declare his workes with reioycing. Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, and praiſe him in the aſſembly of Elders. And ſee the practiſe of the Church concerning this dutie, and the manner of their confeſſion, as well in amplifying their deliuerance, as inlarging Gods praiſes.Pſal. 124.6.7.8. 
                     Praiſed be the Lord, which hath not giuen vs as a prey vnto their teeth. Our ſoule is eſcaped as a Bird out of the ſnare of the fowler, the ſnare is broken and wee are deliuered. Our helpe is in the Lord which hath made Heauen and Earth. This is a dutie commanded of God himſelfe;Pſal. 50.15. 2 Cor. 1.3.4. 
                     I will deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt praiſe me. So the Apoſtle bleſſeth God, euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, (which comforted him, and the reſt) in all their tribulations.

                     Gen. 15.1. 
                     Feare not Abraham, I will be thy ſhield & buckler, and thy exceeding great reward.
                     Eſay 43.2. 
                     Feare not, O Iſraell, when thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the flouds, that they doe not ouerflow thee. When thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle vpon thee.
                     Pſal 23 4.

                     Pſal. 46.12. 
                     they comfort me. God is our hope and ſtrength, and helpe, in troubles ready to be found: Therefore will not we feare, though the earth be moued, and though the Mountaines fall into the middeſt of the Sea.

                     The delight hee had in GODS word, kept him from

periſhing, which yeeldeth vnto vs this ſecond inſtruction.
                  That euery Chriſtian ſhould learne to know (by Dauids
                     
                        doctrine 2 example and experience) the excellent vſe and profit of Gods word,The effectuall knowledge of Gods word, keepeth his children vpright in their tryals. which is able through Gods bleſſing (being truly vnderſtood, and fitly applyed) to keepe vs vpright in our greateſt afflictions and trials, that we fall not away from God, nor miſcarry in our ſelues. He profeſſeth plainely that he had periſhed, had he not beene comforted, and ſo ſupported by Gods word. See how fearefully his faith was aſſailed, his feet were almoſt gone,Pſal. 73.2.3.4. &c. his ſteps had well neere ſlipt, to behold the proſperity of the wicked, and to ſee them ſo luſty: How they eſcaped all manner of troubles, when Gods deareſt children were fearefully plagued. They exceeded in pride, which they put on as a chaine about their necke; and as for cruelty, it couered them as a garment: they were licentious in their words, & preſumptuous in their talke, ſetting their mouth againſt Heauen it ſelfe, blaſpheming God, whom they laboured to depriue both of knowledge and prouidence: Yet theſe wicked men did proſper alway, and increaſe in riches, when hee and other godly men were puniſhed daily, that had care and conſcience to cleanſe their hearts, and waſh their hands from all ſuch defilements of ſinne; So that hee knew not what to thinke, or how to finde out the cauſe thereof: Though hee tooke paines in this poynt; yet certainely his heart was ſtill vexed, and his reines pricked, ſo fooliſh hee was and ignorant, (like a beaſt,) vntill he went into the ſanctuarie of GOD, (to conſult with his word in the holy miniſterie thereof) then preſently hee vnderſtood the reaſon hereof, and was reſolued: Then he as well conſidered the end, as the beginning, and proceedings of ſuch miſcreant and blaſphemous wretches, in what ſlippery places God had ſet them in, how ſodainely he caſt them downe into deſolation, being horribly conſumed: Their proſperity changed as a dreame, and their very image was deſpiſed. Thus God did guide him by his counſell to recouer himſelfe, in this ſtaggering temptation.

The law of God was in his heart,Pſal. 37.24.31. and his ſteps did not ſlide; though he was ready to fall away, yet the Lord put vnder his hand, and preſerued him from deſtruction by the benefite of his word.Pſal. 93.12.13. Bleſſed therefore is the man whom thou chaſtiſeſt (O Lord) and teacheſt him in thy law, that thou mayeſt giue him reſt from the dayes of euill, whiles the pit is digged for the wicked. Firſt, God chaſtiſeth, then he teacheth, and laſtly reſolueth, and giueth reſt and contentment to the afflicted Chriſtian. Is it not reaſon that we endure with patience, the dead corpes (though otherwiſe it would annoy vs) while the graue is making, to put it in, and which neuer againe (being once buried) can trouble our ſight, or my ſenſe? So the wicked that trouble Gods children, are dead in Gods decree, and their graue is a making. Surely the Lord wil not faile his people, neither wil he forſake his inheritance, but miniſter comfort vnto them in the midſt of all their troubles, by the meanes of his word:Pſal. 92.6.7.9. But an vnwiſe man knoweth it not, and a foole doth not vnderſtand this. When the wicked grow as the graſſe, and all the workers of wickedneſſe doe flouriſh, that then they ſhall be deſtroyed for euer: For loe, thy enemies (O Lord) for loe, thine enemies ſhall periſh, all the workers of iniquity againſt thee, thy Church, and children ſhall be deſtroyed, but thou, O Lord, art moſt high for euermore.
                     Pſal. 119.25.28 50.143. &c. How often (in this long Pſalme) doth the Prophet ſtirre vp himſelfe? when his ſoule cleaued to the duſt, and melted for heauineſſe: when hee was almoſt brought to the graue, and dropping away like water in his trials and temptations; he prayeth God to quicken and to raiſe him by his word. Trouble and anguiſh are come vpon me, yet thy commandements are my delight. Thus Gods word was his comfort in his trouble, and ſtill his promiſe refreſhed his ſoule.
                  
                     
                        reason 1
                     God is the Author of it, who is the God of comfort.The reaſon hereof is, firſt, in regard of God himſelfe the Author thereof, Who is the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, which thus comforteth vs in all our tribulations: which is our rod and our ſtaffe, our onely hope and refuge, in troubles ready to be found.2 Cor. 1.

                        .34. Pſal. 23. & 46.1 When Abraham belieued

God, and obeyed his word, in forſaking his Countrey,Gen 12.4. and following him whether he would haue him, hee needeth neither to care, nor feare, then God wil be his buckler, & his exceeding great reward.Gen. 15.1. & 17.1. If he walke before him and be vpright, then God all-ſufficient will make a ſupply of all his wants, and will bleſſe thoſe that bleſſe him,
                     Pſal. 91.1.3.11.14. &c. 
                     and curſe thoſe that curſe him. If wee once dwell in the ſecret of the moſt high, and abide in the ſhadow of the Almighty: If wee make God our hope and fortreſſe, to truſt in him, then will he deliuer vs from the ſnare of the Hunter, and all noyſome euils; then need we not to feare the dangers by night, or day; his truth ſhall bee our ſhield, and his Angels our guide. Thus if we loue him, will he deliuer vs; he will exalt vs, becauſe we haue knowne his name.Pſal. 27.1.5. If the Lord bee our light and ſaluation, whom ſhall we feare? If he be the ſtrength of our life, of whom ſhall wee be afraid? For in the time of trouble hee ſhall hide vs in his Tabernacle; in the ſecret place of his tent ſhall be hide vs, and ſet vs vpon a rocke. Paul therefore (in the perſon of the faithfull) challengeth heauen and earth, with all their force, and ſtill reſolueth,Rom. 8.38.39. 
                     That nothing is able to ſeparate him from the loue of God.
                  
                  Secondly, Gods word is ſo effectuall to comfort and recouer 
                        reason 2 vs in our greateſt extremities,By nature it is comfortable. in reſpect of the nature, qualitie and vertue thereof, being the immortall ſeed, to beget vs againe to a liuely hope.1 Pet. 1.23. Iames 1.18. 
                     Of his owne will begat he vs by the word of truth: And ſo it is called the word of faith and life,Phil. 2.16. and that grace of God which bringeth ſaluation to all belieuers. It is full of heauenly wiſedome, which all the aduerſaries of Gods children are not able to reſiſt In it are contained all the promiſes of God,Tit. 2.11. 
                     Luke 21.15. to comfort vs & confirme our faith. Notable perſwaſions to appeaſe the troubled conſcience, with moſt excellent examples (of all ſorts) both perſons and cauſes to encourage vs; euen a whole cloude of witneſſes,Heb. 12.1.2. companions of our faith, and patterns of our patience, in their variety of croſſes and afflictions. Beſides the moſt famous example of the

author and finiſher of our faith, Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe; to whoſe ſufferings wee muſt bee conformed; with whom (if we ſuffer) we ſhall raigne together with him.2 Tim. 2.12. Now, hee for the ioy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame, and now is ſet at the right hand of the throne of GOD.Epheſ. 6.11. There ſhall wee learne to put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to ſtand againſt all the aſſaults of the Diuell, and quench all the fiery darts of the wicked: For without it we come naked and vnharneſſed (as Souldiers into the field) to fight.
                  
                     
                        vse 1 Which doctrine muſt make vs very ſtudious of Gods word, and diligently to ſearch the Scriptures, as wee loue our ſafety and ſaluation;1 Tim. 6.12. that ſo we may fight the good fight of faith, and lay hold of eternall life; to buckle about vs this armour of proofe,Epheſ. 6. which is able not onely to defend vs, but to foyle all our ſpirituall aduerſaries, and their forces whenſoeuer they ſhall aſſaile vs.2 Cor. 10.4.5. Theſe weapons are not carnall, but mighty through God to caſt downe holdes, and euery thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of GOD, and will enable vs to wreſtle, not onely againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt principalities and powers, againſt worldly Gouernours, and Princes of darkeneſſe, yea, againſt all ſpirituall wickedneſſe in the higheſt places.Pſal. 119.162. Pſal. 56.10. This made our Prophet to ſay, I reioyce at thy word, as one that findeth a great ſpoyle. In Gods word will I reioyce, in the Lords word will I comfort mee. Let therefore the word of God dwell in vs plenteouſly, and that in all wiſedome, to teach and admoniſh vs how to behaue our ſelues,Col. 3.16. and hold out in our greateſt afflictions. Thus Chriſt got the conqueſt ouer Sathan and his temptations,Math. 4. who hereby was forced to forſake him; and ſo ſhall wee be ſure by the ſhield of faith, and word of the ſpirit (which is the word of God) to quench all their fiery darts. The comfort of this Word made Peter to ſleepe as ſoundly in the priſon (bound with two chaines) as if he had beene at liberty in a Pallace.Acts 12.6. And Paul, and Sylas
                     ▪ to ſing as ſweetly after their impriſonment and beating, as in their

greateſt hearts eaſe, and liberty.Acts 16.23.24.25. And this made the Apoſtles to reioyce, That they were counted worthy to ſuffer rebuke for Chriſts name.
                     Acts 5.41.
                  
                  Secondly, it confuteth and confoundeth all Epicures 
                        vse 2 and Atheiſts, that ſcorne at God and all religion, that make a mocke at his word, and contemne his ordinance.Mal. 3.14. 
                     What profit is it (ſay they) to walke in his wayes? They ſay to God, Depart from vs, we deſire not the knowledge of the higheſt.
                     Iob 21.14. Who therefore become deſperate in their tryals and afflictions, being ready (for any comfort they can finde) to hang and murther themſelues with Iudas, Saul, and Achitophell.
                  
                  The delight hee had in Gods law kept him from periſhing: whence we thirdly obſerue,
                  That Gods law and word cannot ſimply profit vs except 
                        doctrine 3 we take ioy and comfort in the ſame;Gods word cannot be profitable, except firſt it be comfortable vnto vs. we muſt firſt taſte and proue the ſweetnes thereof, we muſt before-hand finde out and feele the vertue thereof; as of our foode and phiſicke, before it can ſtrengthen our hearts, heale, cure, and recouer vs from the maladies and miſeries of our afflicted eſtate. When wiſedome entreth into thy heart,
                     Prou. 2.10.11.12 
                     and knowledge delighteth thy ſoule, then (and not before) ſhall counſell preſerue thee, and vnderſtanding ſhall keepe thee, and deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that ſpeaketh froward things, &c. When we once delight in the law of the Lord,
                     Pſal. 1.2. 
                     and exerciſe our ſelues therein day and night, then ſhall wee flouriſh like the planted trees by the riuers of water, that are fruitfull in due ſeaſon, whoſe leaues ſhall neuer fade in any drought of danger. Then (I ſay) whatſoeuer wee doe and take in hand ſhall thriue and proſper. So that if wee will haue comfort in our afflictions, wee muſt firſt finde comfort in the miniſterie of the Word; for there is true ioy and peace to be found, there is life and ſaluation (as before was ſaid) the ſweet promiſes of God, faith, grace, ſpirituall ſtrength, and euery good thing offered vnto vs.
                  GODS Church with the holy miniſterie thereof, is CHRISTS Garden of pleaſures, wherein hee banquetteth with his Elect: euen hee which is the

fountaine of the Garden, (the true and onely head of all particular Chriſtian Churches,Cant. 4.12.15. & 5:1.) The Well of liuing waters, and the ſpring of Lebanon. Hither he commeth to eate his pleaſant fruit. This onely true and Chriſtian Church (being his ſiſter and Spouſe) is as a garden encloſed, as a ſpring and fountaine ſealed vp, not onely ſufficient to refreſh it ſelfe in all the parts, as beds and plants, but ſtrongly fenced againſt all ſtrangers, enemies, and annoyances, that may hurt or hinder the flouriſhing eſtate thereof. Hither Chriſt comm
                        •
                     th to make merry with his friends, and to banquet with his beloued; there hee gathereth his myrthe with his ſpices there he eates the hony combe with his hony, and drinketh his wine with his milke, delighting himſelfe with the ſweet, pleaſant and profitable fruits that the children of God doe yeeld vnto him. Euen as one in gathering moſt ſweet ſmelling hearbes, and ſpices; or eating hony, or drinking the beſt wine and pureſt milke (by which no doubt he meaneth, the word of God, and doctrine of the Church;) Here Chriſt ſollaceth himſelfe (as the good Gardener) with the diuerſity of his plants, and variety of flowers, which himſelfe (with the borders thereof) hath trod out, planted and watered. And the faithfull againe refreſhed, comforted, and furniſhed with his graces, grow ſtill in ſpirituall ſtrength againſt all temptations. Now, the reaſon why the word of God cannot profit vs without delight, is.
                  
                     
                        reason 1 Becauſe that comfort and liking prouoke and procure men to bee diligent in hearing,Comfort and loue to Gods word procure liking and diligent hearing, and ſo by gods bleſſings, faith and obedience. and diligent hearing (by Gods bleſſing) begetteth faith, and faith bringeth vs aſſurance of Gods loue and protection; the euidence and certainty wherof, are the infallible promiſes of God, which are Yea, and Amen.
                  
                  Againe, Loue ſupporteth our labour, and ſetteth our faith aworke:Rom. 10.14. 
                     It ſuffereth all things, it belieueth all things, it 
                           reason 2 hopeth all things, it endureth all things. Iacob louing Rahell, ſerued twiſe ſeauen yeares for her ſake;Gal. 5.6. 1 Cor. 13.7. Gen. 31.39 40 41. neither the heate of the day, nor the froſt of the night, nor the breaking of his

ſleepe; no danger, loſſe, or croſſe, could driue him out. So the Iſraelites toyled and trauelled many miles to the Temple, hungry, weary, and thirſty, they going through the vale of Baca,
                     Pſal. 48. throughout. make Wells therein (contented to refreſh themſelues with the raine that filled their pooles in ſo barren a Wilderneſſe) and thus they went from ſtrength to ſtrength till they appeared before the Lord their God, in their long deſired Syon. And what was the reaſon hereof that they ſtill proceeded without any interruption? euen this was the reaſon: O Lord of hoſtes, how amiable are thy Tabernacles! Our ſoule longeth and fainteth for thy Courts, our heart and fleſh reioyce in the liuing God. Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, and in whoſe hearts are thy wayes: for the Lord our God is a Sunne and ſhield vnto vs, (the Author of all good things, and the deliuerer from all euill.) He will giue grace and glory, and no good thing will hee with-hold from them that are ſincere: Therefore, O Lord of hoſtes, bleſſed is the man that truſteth in thee. We ſee that euery action without affection is laborious and toyleſome, and none euer ſoundly profited by the word, and holy miniſtry thereof, that delighted not in the ſame.
                  Which poynt ſerueth to ſtirre vp our loue and liking of 
                        vse 1 Gods truth, to raiſe vp our dead affections, and to cauſe our dull ſenſes more earneſtly to imbrace the ſame, and to ſet before our eyes the beſt examples for imitation and practiſe. And that we may be perſwaded the better, for the performance of this dutie; let vs briefly conſider the ſingular fruits and effects of Gods word, which we ought ſo worthily to affect. Gods law and word is perfect of it ſelfe to conuert our ſoules from ſinne, and Sathan, to God and godlineſſe, Heauen and happineſſe. His teſtimonie is ſure, to giue wiſedome to the ſimple.Pſal. 19.7.8.9.10.11. 
                     The ſtatutes of the Lord are right, and reioyce the heart: The commandement of the Lord is pure, and giueth light to the eyes: The feare of the Lord is cleane, the iudgements of the Lord are truth, and righteous altogether: By them is thy Seruant made circumſpect, and in keeping of them there it great reward: And therefore they are

more to be deſired then gold, yea, then much fine gold; ſweeter alſo then hony, and the hony combe. Gods word is the meanes for young and old to redreſſe their wicked wayes;Pſal. 119.9.19.35.105. a Counſeller to aduiſe vs, a guide to direct vs, a lanthorne to our feete, a light to our pathes; a reſoluer of our doubts, a ſweetning of our afflictions, able to reuiue vs being dead: Therefore (ſaith Dauid) I will delight in thy ſtatutes,
                     Pſal. 119.16.72.97. Verſe 103. 
                     and I will not forget thy word. The law of thy mouth is better vnto mee then thouſands of gold and ſiluer. O how loue I thy law? it is my meditation continually. How ſweet are thy promiſes vnto my mouth? Yea,
                     Verſe 111.165 
                     more then honie vnto my taſte. Thy teſtimonies haue I taken as an heritage for euer (no earthly thing being comparable to them) for they are the ioy of my heart. They that know thy law ſhall haue great proſperity, and they ſhall haue no hurt. Keepe them and doe them (ſaith Moſes) for this is your wiſedome and vnderſtanding in the ſight of other people.
                     Deut. 4.6.8.9. 
                     Who ſhall ſay, onely this people is wiſe; and what Nation is ſo great, that hath ordinances and lawes ſo righteous? Therefore take heede to thy ſelfe, and keepe thy ſoule diligently. Let not theſe things depart out of thy heart,
                     & 7.12.13.14. &c. 
                     all the dayes of thy life, but teach them thy Sonnes, and thy Sonnes Sonnes. Hence proceedeth all bleſſings from Heauen and Earth, vpon man and beaſt, Corne and Cattell, Wine, Oyle, or what can be deſired. For Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of this life,
                     1 Tim 48. Mat. 6.33. 
                     and of the life to come. If we ſeeke the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, all other things ſhall be miniſtred vnto vs. This is the beſt part and moſt neceſſary duty that cauſed Marie to be preferred before Martha, for ſetting all other things aſide, to come ſit at Ieſus his feete,Luk. 10.41.42 Math. 13.44.45.46. to heare his word. This Pearle muſt bee purchaſed with all we haue; all other things are but droſſe and dung, in reſpect of the excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus our Lord. Therefore wee muſt not onely heare, and reade,Phil. 3.8. and meditate, but by all poſſible meanes encreaſe our loue, liking, and delight, to the holy miniſtery of Gods word,Pſal. 42.12. longing and thirſting after it (with Dauid;) As the chaſed Hart brayeth for the Riuers of water; ſo to haue our ſoules pant and thirſt for the liuing God, and word of

life, not ſo much to labour for the food that periſheth, but for the meate that endureth to euerlaſting life.Iohn 6.27. Thus euery good Chriſtian muſt whet the appetite of his ſoule to delight in Gods law, by conference, meditation, hearing, reading, praying, preaching, and daily frequenting of all holy aſſemblies. I was glad when they ſaid vnto me,
                     Pſal. 122.1. 
                     we will goe to the houſe of the Lord: So was it prophecied of the Chriſtian Church, that many people ſhould goe and ſay, Come,
                     Micha 4.1. 
                     let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Iacob: and he will teach vs his wayes, and we will walke in his pathes. Who are theſe that flie like a clowd,
                     Eſay 2.3. Eſay 60.8. 
                     and as Doues to their windowes? Noting not onely the greatneſſe of the number, but diligence and zeale of ſuch as ſhould come to Chriſt, and receiue his doctrine. And Chriſt ſaid, That from the time of Iohn Baptiſt hitherto,
                     Math. 11.12. 
                     the Kingdome of Heauen ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. Thus,Pſal. 69.9. 
                     the zeale of Gods houſe ſhould eate vs vp.
                  
                  Which ſerueth alſo to confute and reproue all ſuch as 
                        vse 2 are backward and careleſſe in this neceſſary dutie, being idle and vaine in their excuſes or reaſons, to hinder their zeale and loue to the world: any feare, the leaſt danger,Prou. 22.13. and worldly buſineſſe doth put them off;Pſal. 119.51. & 69.7.11.12. there is a Lyon in the way, they ſhall be had in deriſion, or called into queſtion for their forwardneſſe, or at leaſt be cenſured for hypocrites: Some haue their Oxen to prooue,Luke 14.18.19. 20.23.24. their Farme to ſee, their Wife to marry; all theſe yet are inuited to come to the Feaſt, though vnworthy of the ſame; therefore God will fill his houſe with any others then with ſuch, euen thoſe that ſit in the high way, and vnder hedges; the moſt baſeſt and vileſt of men ſhall enter before them, and be ſaued; euen whores and Harlots ſhall ſooner be receaued,Mat. 21.31.32. then thoſe that ſeeme children of thy kingdome. God will raiſe vp to Abraham ſonnes of ſtones,
                     Mat. 3.9. rather then theſe viperous ſerpents ſhall haue the name of his ſeed.
                  Againe, many Atheiſts ſay, It is in vaine to ſerue 
                           vse 3 God,Mal. 3.14.15.16.17. and what profit is it that wee haue kept his commaundements? and that wee haue walked humbly before the

Lord of hoſtes? Therefore they count the proud bleſſed, euen they that worke wickedneſſe are ſet vp, and they that tempt God, yea,
                     Mal. 3.14.15. 
                     they are deliuered. But the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a booke of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and thought vpon his name. They ſayd alſo vnto God, Depart from vs, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes. Who is the Almighty that wee ſhould ſerue him? And what profit ſhould we haue, if we ſhould pray vnto him? But let the counſell of the wicked be farre from me (ſaith Iob,
                     Iob 23.12.) who eſteemed of the words of his mouth more then his appoynted foode. And as for thoſe, and ſuch like Atheiſts,Iob 23.12. Iob 21.14.15.16.17.18. God will diuide their liues in his wrath, They ſhall be as ſtubble before the winde, and as the chaffe that the ſtorme carryeth away. So euery one derided Ieremie, and daily ſcorned his miniſtery,Ier. 20.7.8.10.11. 
                     The word of the Lord was made a reproach, & daily they mocked him. All his familiers watched for his halting, ſaying. It may be he is deceiued; but his perſecutors ſhall be ouerthrowne, and not preuaile, and their euerlaſting ſhame ſhall neuer be forgotten. So they talked of Ezekiell, in deriſion, by the wals, in the dores of their houſes: Come,
                     Ezek. 33.30.31.32. 
                     I pray you, & heare what is the word that commeth from the Lord; So, they come and ſit before him, and heard his words, but they will not doe them; for with their mouths they make ieaſts,
                     See verſes 29.33. 
                     and thou art vnto them a ieaſting ſong: But then ſhall they know that I am the Lord, when I haue layd the Land deſolate and waſte, becauſe of all their abhominations that they haue committed. And when this commeth to paſſe (for loe it will come) then ſhall they know that a Prophet hath beene among them.
                     Mat. 7.6. But Pearles are not to bee caſt among Swine. And ſuch Gaderens are more worthy and meete to haue the company of diuels,Mat. 8 33.34. then the preſence of Chriſt, and preaching of his word.
                        Text.
                     
                  
                  
                     I had periſhed in my afflictions, except they law had beene 
                           doctrine 4 my delight.
                  
                  
                     The ſtrongeſt Chriſtians are not able of themſelues to ſtand vnder their croſſes, without Gods aſſiſtance. 1 Sam. 13.14. Gen. 12.7. & 2.8.9. Gen. 3.6.7.17.18. 1 Kings 11. to the 10 verſe, & 9. chapter throughout.We may learne alſo from hence, that the beſt men and excellenteſt Creatures are not able of themſelues to ſtand, and continue vpright in their tryals and temptations,

without GODS ſpeciall prouidence and prouiſion in the meanes. Dauid, a man after Gods owne heart, poſſeſſed with his ſpirit, and hauing a large portion of his grace, was yet ready to periſh in his afflictions, had he not beene ſupported: Nay, Adam himſelfe, in his innocency created moſt excellently, according to Gods owne image, had no ſooner entred into Eden, (that Garden of pleaſures, and Paradiſe of happineſſe) but ſodainely forfeited his eſtate by Sathans temptations. Who can but admire the fearefull fall of Salomon, wanting neither wiſedome nor wealth, nor any meanes elſe (as one would haue thought) that God or the world could affoord him? yet ſee whither he was falling, euen to the gates and gulfe of hell; from whence he had neuer returned, had not the hand and powerfull arme of God retyred and reclaimed him, by an extraordinary conuerſion and repentance. But come wee from Men to Angels, when GOD had once left them to themſelues (though their condition with other Creatures was incomparable) could not yet keepe their ſtanding and eſtate;2 Pet. 2. Iude verſe 6. but fell from Heauen to Hell, and ſo of heauenly Angels became infernall Diuels. But to come to the tryall of afflictions (which is more proper to this place) how ſoone are the beſt men cruſhed and broken with the burden thereof? and who is able to beare off the blowes of Gods diſpleaſure? Iob was valiant in his ſufferings,Iob 14.44. and very patient for a time. Yet marke how wonderfully he is diſtempered in his paſſions, and taketh on?Iob 3. to the end. Curſing the day and night of his conception and birth, with the Mid-wife and Meſſengers, yea, all the Inſtruments, helpes, and meanes of his comming into the world. Why dyed I not in the birth? Why periſhed I not when I came out of the wombe? Why did the knees preuent mee? And why did I ſucke the breſts? Why was I not hid as an vntimely birth? either as infants that haue not ſeene the light? For my ſighing commeth before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like water. The arrowes of the Almightie are in me,
                     Iob 6.4.11.12. 
                     the venim whereof doth drinke vp my

ſpirit,
                     Iob 7.12. 
                     and the terrours of god fight againſt me. What power haue I that I ſhould endure? Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones? or is my fleſh of braſſe? Am I a ſea, or a Whale-fiſh, that thou keepeſt mee in ward?
                     Iob 10.9. 
                     Remember (I pray thee) that thou haſt made mee as the clay; and wilt thou bring mee to duſt againe? Who can expreſſe Dauids diſtractions and fearefull convulſions (as it were) both in body and ſoule, able to haue diuided both of them from God, had not his grace preuented him, and his powerfull ſpirit preſerued him? Euery where (in the Pſalmes) we may ſee the anatomy of his and the beſt mans frailty, in their afflictions.
                  
                     
                        reason 1 Thus God doth manifeſt his own ſtrength by our weakneſſe,God manifeſteth his ſtrength, by our weakneſſe. and his vnchangeable condition, by our variable diſpoſition, who (the beſt of vs) are notable of our ſelues to ſtand vpright in the day of our trials, without his helping hand, power, and ſpeciall prouidence vnder-prop vs.
                  
                     
                        reason 2 This is Gods priuiledge and ſoueraignty, who onely hath this name and nature (I am,
                     By this he ſheweth his priuiledged power, and vnchangeable nature.) to ſhew his being of himſelfe, and vnchangeable eſſence, and to let vs know, that all his Creatures haue not onely their being, but their ſtanding and vpholding by him that onely is, and ſo conſtantly abideth,Exod. 3.14. Acts 17.25.28. Pſal. 102 27. without fainting or failing euermore.
                  Againe, by this meanes God doth beat downe our pride, 
                        reason 3 that ſo blindeth vs in our owne conceipts, to thinke ſo highly of our ſtrength and eſtate.He humbleth vs by our infirmities, that we may only relye vpon his ſtrength and might. God therefore will proue vs by afflictions, that we may know our ſelues, our faith, our ſtrength, and chiefeſt of our man-hoode; that ſo finding out our weakneſſe, wee may onely and wholly relye vpon his ſtrength and might.
                  
                     
                        reason 4 Which leſſon may teach vs the excellent vſe and profit of afflictions, ſent vnto vs as inſtructions, to learne vs to know our ſelues in our beſt ſtrength and ſtate, to beat down our pride, and to teach vs true humility, to truſt onely in the Lord, and to diſtruſt our ſelues, and all other meanes whatſoeuer they be without him.
                  
                     Alſo it maketh much for our conſolation in our greateſt 
                        vse 2 diſtreſſe, when all outward meanes and helpes ſhall faile and forſake vs; that yet we raiſe and rouze vp our ſelues (through the affiance wee haue in GOD, and the ſtrength of his might) knowing the ſupply of his grace to be ſufficient for vs at all aſſayes; who ſtill manifeſteth himſelfe to be the ſtrongeſt in our greateſt weakneſſe:2 Cor. 12.9. and that when there is no other hand or helpe to relieue vs, yet he himſelfe with his own right arme is able to ſaue vs, and to prouide ſuch meanes as ſhall bee ſufficient to comfort vs in our greateſt aſſaults.
                  Thus much of Dauids confeſſion. Now followeth his reſolution.The ſecond part of the text.
                  
                  
                     I will neuer forget thy precepts; ſince they kept me from periſhing in my afflictions, and miniſtred ſuch ioy and comfort vnto mee, not onely refreſhed but reuiued and quickened me (being as good at dead in my owne apprehenſion): For this cauſe I reſolue neuer to forget ſo comfortable and powerfull meanes of my recouery. From whence we may learne.
                  That it is the dutie of euery Chriſtian, ſtill to remember 
                        doctrine 5 the meanes of their comfort and deliuerance from their former troubles and afflictions,We muſt remember the ancient meanes of comfort & deliuerance, if we will be eaſed in our preſent miſeries. & ſo to manifeſt their loue and care for the vſe and reſpect of Gods ordinances, not onely for the time paſt, but alſo for the dayes to come. As he that hath beene cured of an olde diſeaſe. and healed of a wound, will hardly forget the receipt and plaſtour. Dauid hauing formerly found that the comfort of Gods word had kept him from periſhing, had quickened and reuiued him (being as good as dead in his owne iudgement and ſenſe) reſolueth neuer againe to forget Gods precepts: So he telleth vs how he was diſquieted, and found no reſt, how his very bones conſumed, how he roared all the day, vntill he confeſſed his ſinne (which was the cauſe thereof.) Then I acknowledged my ſinne, neither hid I my iniquity:
                     Pſal. 32 3.4.5. 
                     for I thought, I will confeſſe againſt my ſelfe my wickedneſſe, vnto the Lord, and thou forgaueſt the puniſhment of my ſinne. Therefore

ſhall euery one that is godly (in like caſe) make his prayer vnto thee, in a time when thou mayeſt bee found, (for then is God neereſt vnto his children when their troubles are the greateſt;) ſurely in the flouds of great waters they ſhall not come neere him. So, going into the field againſt Goliah,
                     1 Sam. 17.37. he remembreth how God deliuered him from the Lyon and the Beare, and ſo ſtill reſolueth to hope for helpe and deliuerance at gods hand, and he prayeth to God to haue mercy vpon him, and to harken vnto his prayer, who heretofore had heard him in his diſtreſſe,Pſal 4.1. and ſet him at liberty.
                  
                     
                        reason 1 Now, the reaſon why we muſt remember the meanes of our deliuerance,We are ſtill ſubiect to the like tryals and afflictions, and therefore muſt remember the ancient remedies. together with our forme: diſtreſſed eſtate is, becauſe we are ſubiect againe to fall therein and may ſtill haue need of the old receipt: as thoſe that fall againe into the ſame diſeaſe, as they haue their relapſes, ſo they muſt haue the ſame remedies. He that is well may and will be ſick againe; he that is healed may be wounded againe, or at leaſt haue his ſore to ranckle and breake out againe therfore the prouident patients record their receipts, and reſolue to vſe them as occaſion ſerueth.
                  
                     
                        reason 2 Secondly, no new preſcription can proue ſo ſafe and ſure as thoſe that are experienced,There are no receipts more ſafe then thoſe that haue beene proued. ſuch for the moſt part are voyde of danger, and infallible. And as he is worthily accounted the beſt Phyſition, that recouereth moſt patients, and he the skilfulleſt Surgeon that healeth moſt dangerous wounds: So that phiſicke, that potion, that plaiſter (by which ſicke and ſore men haue been cured, healed, and reſtored) is moſt worthy to be regiſtred and recorded: Such receipts (I ſay) are moſt pretious, that haue been proued, and will not likely faile.
                  
                     
                        reason 3 Thirdly, that we ſhould remember theſe comfortable meanes and remedies to eaſe vs in our trials,That we ſhould remember them, they are written and regiſtred to our hands. and to keepe vs from deſpaire, they are written & regiſtred to our hands in Gods booke; as alſo to confirme our knowledge, practiſe, and obedience in and for the holy vſe thereof, they are commended vnto vs by Gods word, they are vrged and

applyed for that purpoſe in the holy miniſtery thereof. So is the patience of holy Iob, by Saint Iames,
                     Iames 5.11. 
                     You haue heard (ſaith he) of his patience, and what end the Lord made: And whatſoeuer things are written aforetime,
                     Rom. 15.4. 
                     are written for our learning, that wee through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might haue hope. And as the ſame infirmities, ſicknes, and maladies both of body and ſoule, doe ſtill remaine to mortall men: So the ſame wholeſome receipts, meanes and medicines, with the ſame Phyſitians hand and manner of recouery, are ſtill commended in Gods word, to all the faithfull for their vſe.
                  Which ſerueth for the inſtruction of euery Chriſtian, to 
                        vse 1 be a ſtudious obſeruer of Gods word, and diligently to ſearch out the moſt comfortable and commodious vſe of the Scriptures; both for their knowledge and obedience; to caſt the eyes of their minde and vnderſtanding vpon the beſt examples of Gods Saints and Children, that there are propounded for their vertues and infirmities, both to helpe and heale them in the like condition: So when we fret and chaſe (as Dauid did) at the proſperity of the wicked;Pſal. 37. & 73.3 wee muſt learne with him to ſee our folly, and goe to Gods Sanctuary and obſerue the end of ſuch like ſinners; and ſo bee comforted and confirmed from falling away from God, or following their wicked courſe. To cure our owne ſtubbornneſſe and rebellions, we muſt not (with the vnbeleeuing Iſraelites) harden our hearts, or tempt the Lord in our troubles:Heb. 3.8.9.10. Exod. 7. & 8.9.10. neither lift vp our ſelues with Pharaoh) in ſuch variety of iudgements to haue our hearts harder and harder, and ſo to ſtriue againſt our Maker; which is the high way to increaſe his plagues,Leuit. 26. Ier. 2.35. Amos 4. Hoſ. 5.15. Heb. 3.13. and bring vs to deſtruction, but rather be humbled, and tremble at his word, with melting hearts, and not ſtill to exaſperate the Lord, and ſharpen his face againſt vs, but rather (while it is called to day) to heare his voyce, and be reclaimed.
                  This alſo reproueth all ſuch as are ſo mightily diſtracted 
                        vse 2 and diſtempered in their troubles and afflictions, that grow ſo violent & outragious in word and deed, and fall to be deſperate,

they ſay they are weary of their liues, they cannot tell what to do, they would pardon them that would ridde them out of the way; moſt truely diſcerning Sathans cenſure,Iob 1.9.11. (which to holy Iob and Gods children is nothing but a ſlander) they ceaſe from bleſſing God, and fall to blaſpheme him to his face. Therefore Gods children muſt be warie from yeelding to ſuch infirmities, to which they are alſo ſubiect, and pray for true patience, whereby they may poſſeſſe their ſoules,Luke 21.19. and for a true and a liuely faith, whereby they ſhall be able to ouercome the diuell, the world, and the fleſh,1 Pet. 5.9. Iames 4.7. 1 Iohn 5.4. and get the conqueſt ouer themſelues, and ſuch vnruly affections. If they ſearch the Scriptures, they ſhall ſee a cloude of Witneſſes; who by the ſhield of faith, and ſword of the ſpirit▪ haue fought the fight, and got the conqueſt in their greateſt feares and doubts. Thus God hath comforted vs (ſaith Paul of himſelfe,2 Cor. 1.4. and the faithfull) that we may be able to comfort them which are in any afflictions, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelues are comforted of God. Let vs remember the time paſt (with Dauid) and thinke vpon all his wondrous workes. We muſt not bee careleſſe, and caſt away the medicine when once weare healed,Pſal. 76.5.7. for the time of our olde diſeaſe, and ſores, may come againe; but ſtill write in our note-Bookes ſuch ſoueraigne receipts, and approoued remedies, to remember afreſh when our infirmities newly aſſaile vs: At ſuch a time I prayed and was deliuered from the pricks of the fleſh from ſuch and ſuch buffetings of Sathan did the Lord defend me;2 Cor. 12.7. therefore will I pray againe being newly aſſaulted: Such a day and yeare I humbled my ſoule by faſting and prayer, and was ſaued from ſuch a iudgement. At another time (in my melancholy moode, and the ſtrong temptations and deluſions of Sathan) I conferred with godly men, and diligently reſorted to holy aſſemblies, and this relieued and reſtored me: I will neuer therfore forget this comfortable meanes, but will for euer remember them; yea, daily practiſe them vpon euery good occaſion, and iuſt reſpect. Thus good things muſt be pondered with bleſſed Marie,
                     Luke 2.51. and not onely conceiued,

but readily brought forth againſt the time of neede. Such treaſure of heauenly ſtore muſt heedfully be locked vp in the treaſury of our ſoules. I haue hid thy promiſe within my heart, that I might not ſinne againſt thee.
                     Pſal. 119.11. Pro. 2.11. & 4.21. So wiſedome counſelleth to hide his commandements within vs, and to keepe them in the middeſt of our heart: And the Apoſtle exhorteth vs not to let them ſlippe out of our mindes; or not to haue our ſoules as crazed veſſels, receiuing much, and holding nothing.Heb. 2.1.
                  
                  Where the Prophet ſeemeth to diſtinguiſh betweene law and law, precept and precept, word and word; ſaying,
                        Text.
                      
                     Except thy law, thy precepts, and ſo in the reſt of the Pſalme, thy word, thy iudgements, thy statutes, thy ceremonies, thy commaundements, &c. q. d. They, and they onely doe this, and that, and euery thing: They and none other haue this vertue and operation of comforting, conuerting and ſauing.
                  This may teach vs that Gods word alone, and no other,
                        doctrine 6 ioyeth the heart in affliction,Gods word alone doth quicken and comfort the diſtreſſed ſoule. reioyceth the ſoule in temptation, and quickeneth and reuiueth vs in the greateſt extremities and diſtreſſes. Moſes, ſpeaking but of the law and commandements deliuered from God, inforceth obedience to the ſame,Deut. 11.26.27 28. Deut. 32.47. Phil. 2.16. in telling them that it is the word of Life; that it ſetteth before them life and death; life to the obeyers, death to the breakers. And Paul calleth the Goſpell The word of life, which indeed quickeneth vs by faith, in beleeuing the promiſes, when the law (for want of obedience) ſlayeth vs;Rom. 4.13. & 10.5.6. Rom. 7.9.10. 2 Cor. 3.6. Pſal. 1.9. Heb. 4. therefore he preferreth the righteouſneſſe of faith, before the righteouſneſſe of the law, which is a killing letter to vnregenerate men; when the Goſpell (to all belieuers) becomes a quickening ſpirit. This is the word that is able to conuert our ſoules, which is mighty in operation, & ſharper then any ſword. The weapons of our warfare (which we fetch from hence) able through God to caſt downe ſtrong holds, & euery high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God,2 Cor. 10. and to bring into captiuity euery thought to the obedience of Chriſt. The powerfull preaching

whereof is The power of God to ſaluation to all that beleiue.
                     Rom. 1.16. 1 Cor. 1.18. This forceth the very infidell (through the working of Gods ſpirit in the heart) being rebuked in holy aſſemblies, to fall downe on his face and worſhip God,1 Cor. 14, 24.25 and plainely to acknowledge that God is in his meſſengers. This powerfull word of Chriſt raiſed Lazarus from the graue of corruption,Iohn 11.43.44 and is able to reuiue vs being dead in our ſinnes; and to raiſe vs from the death of ſinne, to the life of righteouſneſſe.
                  The reaſons why Gods word (in the holy miniſterie thereof) is of ſuch efficacy to quicken vs, are the ſame with doctrine the ſecond.
                  
                     It is the Inſtrument by which he worketh & effecteth his purpoſe and decree.Beſides, Gods word is the ſpeciall inſtrument by which he worketh and effecteth his purpoſe and decree. By his word he created all things, and by his word they are vpholden and preſerued: By, and according to his word, he ſaueth and condemneth, diſpoſeth and ordereth all perſons and actions,Heb. 1.2.3. Iohn 12.48. yea, all creatures, with their motions, referring them to their ends appoynted, and making them all to ſerue his glory. God and his word are in a league vnſeparable▪ he neuer croſſeth it, being his good will and pleaſure. He that heareth it and the meſſengers thereof,Math. 10.14. Luke 10.16. heareth him, and he that deſpiſeth it, and them, deſpiſeth him; where it is not receaued, he accounteth himſelfe reiected.
                  Which ſerueth, firſt to teach vs to honour God in this 
                        vse 1 his high and incomparable ordinance, to yeeld obedience to his will reuealed in his word, if we will not be accounted as rebellious againſt him.Rom. 10.14. If we will not effectually heare in the holy miniſtery thereof, we cannot beleeue; if we beleeue not, we cannot be ſaued. If we contemne and deſpiſe it,Acts 5.39. Iohn 12.44. it ſhall be our iudge at the latter day. Hee that reſiſteth it, ſtriueth with his Maker. Without the comfort of Gods word, we muſt needs periſh in our afflictions; if Gods precepts quicken vs not, we are but dead and damned.
                  
                     
                        vse 2 This word conſidered in the properties, power, and wonderfull effects thereof, ſheweth vs alſo the difference betweene it and the lawes of mortall men, their doctrines

and traditions, their commandements and inuentions. This word alone is the rule of faith, and the reſoluer of the conſcience: All other humane deuiſes are but as ſtraw and ſlubble, yea, droſſe it ſelfe to the pureſt gold.1 Cor. 3.12. Pſal. 12. This hath beene tryed to the vtmoſt in the furnace, and is ſtill more glorious. The turning of mens deuiſes are but as clay.

Therefore the Prophet that hath a dreame, let him tell a dreame, and he that hath my word, let him ſpeake my word faithfully. What is the chaffe to the Wheate?

                           Text.I called vpon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon, thou haſt heard my voyce: ſtop not thy eare from my ſight, and from my crie. Thou dreweſt neare in the day that I called vpon thee: Thou ſaidst, feare not; O Lord, thou haſt maintained the cauſe of my ſoule, and haſt redeemed my life.
                     
                  
                  
                     THe Prophets meaning is, that hee prayed heartily to God (the ruler of the whole world) from the place & condition of greateſt extremity, when no meanes of deliuerance appeared, reſting ſtill in the experience of Gods loue, who heretofore had heard his petitions, and now (hopeth) will not refuſe them, (being earneſt and hearty.) And though he ſeeme to be farre off,
                        Sence.
                      will yet take notice of them in the manifeſtation of his loue (in the meanes,) according to his gracious promiſe, ſtill encouraging his ſeruants in their greateſt dangers: Neither doubteth hee but God will defend both his life, and good cauſe, that procured the danger; and will ſend deliuerance from the lands of all thoſe that would deſtroy him and his Church.

miſery in times paſt: Secondly,
                        Diuiſion.
                      the meanes hee vſed for his deliuerance: Thirdly, the fruits and effects thereof. His miſery is enlarged: 1. In regard of the place being a low dungeon: 2. In regard of his condition, hee ſighed and ſorrowed, he was full of feare, and in danger of his life. The meanes which he vſed was Prayer: which is commended; 1. For the faithfulnes: 2. For the feruency thereof: For the faithfulnes, he called vpon God alone, and grounded his prayer onely vpon his name and power: For the feruency of his prayer, he ſaith, hee called, cryed, ſighed and ſorrowed: 3. The fruits and effects of his prayer are noted, by theſe circumſtances: 1. God heard him: 2. Hee drew neare, manifeſting his care and prouidence towards him in the meanes: 3. He freed him from feare, maintained his cauſe, and redeemed his life from the danger of death.
                  The ſumme is,
                        Summe.
                      that as God heretofore had heard and deliuered him in, and from ſuch great dangers and diſtreſſe, ſo he would ſtill heare, helpe and deliuer him, and his afflicted Church, in ſauing him, and redeeming him, and it, from their ſo great preſent dangers and afflictions.
                  
                     Being in the low dungeon deſtitute of all worldly helpe, hee called vpon the name of the Lord: Teaching vs.

                  That true faithfull prayer and inuocation of Gods name,
                        doctrine 1 is a moſt ſoueraigne means & remedy for comfort and deliuerance, in and from our greateſt diſtreſſes;Prayer is the moſt ſoueraign meanes of help in our greateſt dangers. when all other helpes doe faile vs, this will ſerue our turne; and is the onely refuge of all Gods children. I looked vpon my right hand, but there was none that would know me;
                     Pſal. 142.45. 
                     all refuge failed wee, then cryed I to the Lord, and ſayd, thou art my hope. When the ſnares of death compaſſed me, and the griefes of the graue caught me, when I found trouble and ſorrow,Pſal. 116.3.4. & 107. & 22.11. then I called vpon the name of the Lord, ſaying, I beſeech thee O Lord deliuer my ſoule.
                     
                        reason 1
                  
                  The reaſon hereof is,It is gods commandement & ordinance to relieue vs. that God hath commanded and ordained it ſo to be. Call vpon me in the time of thy trouble, ſo will I deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me. Come to me (ſaith Chriſt) all that trauaile and are laden, and I will eaſe you.
                     Pſal. 50.15.
                     
                     Hee ſhall call vpon mee,
                     Mat. 11.28. Pſal. 91.15. 
                     and I will heare him: I will be with him in trouble, I will deliuer him, and glorifie him.
                  
                  
                     
                        reason 2 Secondly God is the iudge, reuenger, and defender of all his that ſuffer wrong;God is the reuenger and defender of his, who being called vpon will heare & helpe. he heareth all cauſes and controuerſies, defendeth the cauſe of the widdow and fatherles; he ſitteth in the throne and iudgeth right, O Lord God the auenger, exalt thy ſelfe clerely, exalt thy ſelfe thou iudge of the world: How long ſhall the wicked triumph? and ſo he concludeth that God is his refuge and rocke of his hope.Pſ. 94.1.2.3 22 & 9.4.9.13.18. Pſal. 10.1.12.14.17.18.
                  
                  The vſe hereof is, to make vs feruent and forward in prayer. Is any man afflicted; let him pray; for the prayer of a 
                           vse 1 righteous man preuaileth much (if it be feruent:) heauen and the eare of God is open to him.Acts 12.5. Iames 5.13.17. Exod. 17.11. When Moſes held vp his hand Iſraell preuailed; That the Iſraelites might ſee that his hand had a greater ſtroake in the fight, then all theirs,Hoſea 12.3. Rom. 15.30. Pſal. 106.23. the ſucceſſe muſt riſe and fall with it. Therefore we muſt wreſtle, with Iacob, who by his ſtrength had power with God; and ſtriue with Paul, and ſtand in the gap with Moſes.
                  
                  Secondly, it condemneth all ſuch as contemne this ordinance, 
                        vse 2 and doe not preferre this meanes before all other: without which (indeed) all other actions and inſtruments are vnholy and vnprofitable;1 Tim. 4 5. as Chariots, Horſemen, Money, Bread, Phyſicke: which moſt excellent ordinance of God is yet leaſt and laſt thought vpon by many: For if men or diuells can ſted them, they will not be beholden vnto God; when it is too late then will they ſend for the Prieſt (as their Prouerbe is;) yet ſo will infidells doe, Yea, Pharoh himſelfe, with Ahab and the greateſt Athieſts.
                  
                  
                     
                        vse 3 Thirdly, it maketh for the conſolation of Gods children, that their caſe cannot be deſperate, or themſelues deſtitute of helpe. If they can but call and cry vnto God; if they can but ſigh and groane; though they can but chatter like a Swallow with Ezekiah,
                     Eſay 38.14. Pſal. 55.2. 1 Sam 1.13.15. make a noyſe in their prayers with Dauid, and but euen mooue their lips with Hannah, it is ſufficient if thy ſoule bee powred out with hers; for God knoweth the meaning of the ſpirit, which

likewiſe helpeth our infirmities.Rom. 8.26.27. So that when Gods children are in any danger, faith doth accompany them, and mooueth them to prayer, and in praying they are ſtill more feruent: they can neuer be brought ſo lowe, but they can caſt their eyes to Heauen. When they haue none other to deliuer them, they can deliuer themſelues by faithfull prayer: So Ionah was heard out of the Whales belly,Ionah 2.2. Dan. 5.22. Exod. 14 15. Pſal. 130.1. 
                     Daniell out of the Lyons denne, Moſes at the red Sea, Dauid out of the deepe, all theſe wonderfully perplexed, and ouerwhelmed (with outward ſorrowes) yet heard and deliuered by faithfull prayer.
                  He onely called vpon Gods name in the dungeon.

                  True and faithfull prayer muſt be made and directed 
                        doctrine 2 to God alone; Thou that heareſt the prayer,
                     God alone muſt be prayed vnto. Pſal. 
                     to thee ſhall all fleſh come. Whoſoeuer calleth vpon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaued. For this is Gods commandement,62.2. Ioel 1.38. Rom. 10.13. with his promiſe annexed, that we call vpon him in our troubles, and he will helpe vs. Aske, and you ſhall haue, (ſaith Chriſt,) ſeeke, and you ſhall finde, knocke, and it ſhall it be opened vnto you.
                     
                        reason 1
                  
                  It is a part of Gods worſhip and ſeruice:Pſal. 50.15. & 91.15. Math. 7.7. 
                     Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue. In the dayes of Enoſh ſonne of Seth,
                     Prayer is a part of Gods worſhip, proper vnto him. men began to call on the name of the Lord; that is, they began to be religious, and profeſſed the ſame, by calling on Gods name. Therefore God vpbraideth Iacob for not calling vpon him; and ſaith, Iſraell had wearyed him in not performing this ſeruice, and going 
                        reason 2 to other.Mat. 4.10. Gen. 4.26. Eſay 43.22.
                  
                  Againe to call vpon creatures, is without any warrant; and whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne; and it croſſeth the 
                        reason 3 practiſe of all Gods Saints:To pray to any Creature is without warrant. doubtleſſe thou art our father though Abraham be ignorant of vs, and Iſraell know vs not, yet thou O Lord art our father and our redeemer, thy name is for euer.Rom. 14.23. Eſay 63.16.
                  
                  Which doctrine ſerueth to direct vs to God alone in our prayer and ſupplications; being according to his word 
                        vse 1 and will, a worſhip which is proper vnto him; and which he requireth at our hands, a moſt ſafe warrantable courſe,

ſtill practiſed in Gods church, agreeable to the forme of Chriſts prayer,Mat. 6.9. Iohn 16.23. 1 Iohn 5.14. (a moſt perfect patterne for vs to follow,) and Chriſt himſelfe doth aſſure vs, that whatſoeuer we aske the father in his name, he will giue it vs: if as S. Iohn ſaith, we aske it according to his will.
                  
                  
                     
                        vse 2 It likewiſe confuteth all pagans and papiſts, which cry to their Baal from morning to euening,1 Kings 18.26. roaring like beaſts; that pray to angels and Saints and other creatures; that offer ſo many ſacrifices of praier and praiſe to the Queene of heauen,Ier. 44. deuiſing (I know not how many) Letanies and Dirges to He-Saints, and Shee-Saints, with the multitude whereof they haue ſtuffed their Kalenders, till their be no roome; and to fill vp their accompt haue cannonized and inueſted a number of Traitours to God and their gouernours, in time paſt; who more iuſtly may be placed in hell, then haue the meaneſt roome in heauen: yet theſe be their goodly interceſſours, that muſt haue their prayers.
                  
                     
                        Text.
                     
                     I called vpon thy name: As one acquainted with Gods power, he dependeth alone vpon his prouidence and protection. Obſerue againe from hence:
                  
                     
                        doctrine 3 That true and effectuall prayer, is and muſt be grounded vpon the aſſured knowledge of gods name and power:Faithful prayer is alwaies accompanied with effectuall knowledge of Gods name and power. Therefore he that will come to God (ſaith the Apoſtle) muſt beleeue that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeeke him. They that know thy name (hauing experience of thy grace and might) will put their truſt in thee: for thou Lord haſt not failed them that ſeeke thee. The name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower,Heb. 11.6. Pſal. 9.10. Prou. 18.18. the righteous runne vnto it, and are exalted: being beaten from their ſtandings (as poore ſouldiers in the field) yet the name of the Lord is their ſure defence and onely refuge. Dauid aſſuring himſelfe of Gods protection, and reſting vpon his name and power, ſecureth himſelfe againſt all aſſaults, as one that is in the ſtrongeſt caſtle and ſureſt hold; be dare come forth into the field and challenge all his foes:Pſal. 18 2. when once he hath got the Lord to be his ſhield and buckler,Gen. 15.1. then Abraham neede

not to feare whereſoeuer he goeth.
                  Now as calling vpon Gods name,
                        Reaſon.
                      is a moſt ſpeciall meanes to deliuer vs from our greateſt dangers;No man can call vpon God that beleeueth not, and none can belieue that knoweth not God in the miniſtery of his word. ſo How (I pray you) ſhall they call vpon him, in whom they haue not beleeued? and how ſhall they beleeue on him, of whom they haue not heard? Such aske and haue not, becauſe they aske amiſſe. All Gods promiſes are intailed to thoſe alone that doe beleeue; ſuch are within his couenant, which he hath indented, and ſealed, yea deliuered with his hand, for the vndoubted aſſurance of their deliuerance: Such may but aske and haue, if they doe but knock,Rom. 16.14. Iames 4.3. the dore ſhall be opened. Be it vnto thee (ſaith Chriſt) according to thy faith.

                     O woman great is thy faith. If Gods children haue faith in their hearts, it beareth downe all before it, and breaketh through▪ all manner of lets and hinderances in the world; it ouercomes the world, and vanquiſheth the diuell, and he that truly hath it, may challenge the force of all the creatures, if they ſhould lay ſiege againſt him:1 Iohn 5.4. For there is nothing impoſſible vnto faith, which onely is grounded vpon God and his word:Math. 17.20. So that we muſt know our faith in God, by our knowledge of God. If we haue no word, we haue no warrant, our faith is but infamy. This made Paul to ſuffer with chearefulneſſe for the goſpell,2 Tim. 1.22. and was not aſhamed: for I know whom I haue beleeued, and I am perſwaded he is able to keepe that which I haue committed to him againſt that day: ſo ſaith Peter,
                     1 Pet.4.19. 
                     let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit their ſoules to him in well doing, as to a faithfull creatour. So ſure and well knowne is God to the faithfull, that they put both bodies and ſoules, life and goods (with all things elſe) to his diſpoſing. For faith is the ground of things hoped for, and an aſſured euidence of things that are not ſeene:Heb. 11.1. it maketh things abſent, as though they were preſent, and maketh things promiſed, ſo certaine as if they were performed.
                  The conſideration whereof muſt make vs very induſtrious 
                        vse 1 in prayer and painefulneſſe, for the obtaining of true

faith, and attayning to the ſound knowledge of God, which in a Chriſtian are alwaies inſeperable; and ſo to vſe the meanes whereby they may bee come by, and increaſed, which are the Word, and the Sacraments; experience of gods loue, examples of good men, and their conference, delighting in Gods Sabaoths, and holy aſſemblies, &c.

The very prayers and ſacrifice of ſuch vngodly, ignorant and faithleſſe perſons, are abhomination to the Lord, and his very ſoule abhorreth them.

                     1 Sam. 1.13.15.) yet powring out their ſoules, and calling vpon Gods name, (in the confidence of his power) they ſhall be relieued, though their faith be weake (yet if true) and aſſuredly grounded vpon Gods name and power, they ſhall be heard, euen out of the dungeon of extremities.

worthy of their companie. Ioyne to theſe Abraham for his vncertaine dwelling: Dauid for his manifolde enemies: Iob for inward and outward miſeries of all ſorts.

All kinde of croſſes and calamities attend vpon them in the world, vntill they be at reſt with God in Heauen.
                  The reaſon hereof is, that ſince the ſame corruption of

fauour and credite they are in with the Lord. Since an outward condition is here to all men alike;Eccleſ. 9.2. 
                     All things come alike to all, and the ſame condition is to the iust and to the wicked; to the good, and to the pure, and to the polluted; as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath. For although it be moſt certaine, that God hath a ſpeciall care for the ſaluation of the faithfull; yet ſuch is the courſe of things falling out vnto men in this life, that it cannot be iudged, by the outward ſhew and appearance whom God loueth, or whom he hateth: Such a certaine, infinite and endleſſe confuſion, is caſt before the eye of man; and therefore Gods children muſt not promiſe themſelues any immunity from troubles, or worldly ſucceſſe, but rather to looke alwaies for the contrary, and labour ſtill to ſubdue their inordinate paſſions, in thinking their caſe to be ſingular, cenſuring God to bee too rigorous, and ſo calling his iuſtice into queſtion, which is neere vnto blaſphemy.

When they are ſanctified vnto vs, they heale our ſinfull nature, as a good ſalue that is laide to the ſore; they recouer the ſickneſſe of our ſoules, as good phyſicke cures the diſeaſe: Thus they proue as wholſome medicines, and fatherly chaſticements, to amend and reforme Gods elect.

As malefactors (on a racke;) and vnhappy Schollers in a Schoole, are forced to acknowledge their faultes; ſo God by affliction wreſteth out a confeſſion of ſinne, and reſolution of amendment in his Children. Thus God doth ſcowre and clenſe away the droſſe and drowſineſſe of our nature, and ſo rowſeth and raiſeth vp our dead hearts to earneſt and faithfull prayers, that it turnes them to cryings,Rom. 8.26. ſighings, and groanings, that cannot be expreſſed.

(as Ezekiell ſpeaketh,) hyding himſelfe in the Riuer Nylus; and as Paul calleth Nero a Lyon, ſo here is Pharaoh termed a Dragon, to expreſſe the qualitie of Tyrants: Thus, with the remembrance of that eminent deliuerance out of Egipt, they comfort their hearts, and cheriſh their hopes, to bee freed from the preſent captiuity: for what ſhall hinder God from bringing them out of Babylon, more then it did the freeing of their forefathers from the ſlauery of Egipt?

The Spouſe was ſluggiſh, and would not heare the voyce of her bride-groome, knocking, and ſtanding without, at the dore, till his haire was full of dew, and his lockes with the drops of the night; but afterward ſhe opened, and her welbeloued was gone and paſt: ſhe ſought him and could not preſently finde him, but is beaten and wounded of the watchmen, and hath many croſſes; yet ſtill wee muſt remember Gods former mercies, and our olde deliuerances and ſo recouer our hope.
                  
                     I called vpon thee, and thou dreweſt neare, and ſaidst,

                  God is ſtill ready and at hand to comfort his children 
                        doctrine 9 in their greateſt dangers, and to rid them of their feares.God is ſtill ready and at hand to comfort and relieue his children, in their greateſt dangers. 
                     God is our hope, and ſtrength, and helpe, in troubles ready to be found. For further proofe and vſe of this, ſee doctrine 1. in the firſt Sermon.
                  Now God eaſeth them of their feares by ſhewing them his fauour, in giuing them the ſpirit of adoption, which remoueth the cauſe of feare,Pſal. 46.1. and maketh them as bolde as Lyons▪ becauſe their ſinnes are remoued,
                        Reaſon.
                      and they reconciled to God through Chriſt, yea,Rom. 8.15.17. Prou. 28.1. made his children and

heires annexed with Chriſt. This ſpirit is the earneſt of their ſafety and ſaluation.2 Cor. 1.22. & 5.5. Epheſ. 1.13.14. Rom. 8. 
                     The Lord is on their ſide, and who can be againſt them? All things now worke together for the beſt, & therfore, what, or who can ſeperate them from the loue of Chriſt? ſurely ſuch can neuer be mooued, nor be afrayd of ill tydings; their heart is fixed and beleeueth in the Lord,Pſal. 112.6.7. & 34.4. they ſeeke to the Lord, and he heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their feare.
                  
                     
                        Vſe.
                     Which muſt make vs diligently to ſeeke the Lord in our dangers. If we would be ſoundly cured of our feares, let vs goe to him by our faithfull prayers, and this will free our hearts from vnneceſſary doubts, and keepe out deſpaire, that wee ſhall neuer be diſmaide. In nothing be carefull, (ſaith the Apoſtles) but in all things let your requeſts be made knowne vnto God; and then the peace of God (which paſſeth all vnderſtanding) ſhall keepe your hearts and mindes in Chriſt Ieſus: For this peace quieteth the heart, and ſetleth the minde in the aſſurance of a happy iſſue, from all difficulties and dangers.Pſal. 3.4.5.6. This courſe tooke Dauid, who is not afrayd to challenge tenne thouſand enemies that compaſſe him round about; nay ſo ſecure he was in the confidence of God (whom he called vpon) that hee layd him downe and ſlept, and roſe againe, without any more adoe; becauſe the Lord ſuſtained him.

                     O Lord thou haſt maintained the cauſe of my ſoule, and haſt redeemed my life.

                        doctrine 10 God will alwaies vphold and maintaine the righteous cauſe of his children;God wil maintaine the righteous cauſe of his children. whatſoeuer bee their dangers and troubles, he will haue a ſpeciall care both of their perſons and buſineſſe they haue in hand. He ſhall bring forth their righteouſneſſe as the light, and their iudgements as the noone day:
                     Pſal. 37.6. Their righteous cauſe and holy conuerſation he will make to be ſo euident, as the Sunne when it riſeth, nay, as at noone when it is the higheſt, and ſhineth brighteſt. He will ſtand by them, and deliuer them, and their cauſe, from vnrighteous iudgement: See the execution; how he ſitteth in the aſſembly of Gods,Pſal. 82.1.2. to ſee and examine both them

and their proceedings. See further of this poynt, Doctr. 1, and the firſt Sermon, in the proofes.
                  It is his place and office ſo to doe;
                        Reaſon.
                      Shall not the Iudge of all the world doe right?It is his place and office. It belongs to him to render vnto euery man according to his workes: He muſt needs defend the truth, being the God of truth, yea, truth it ſelfe;Gen. 18.25. Pſal. 146.7. Reuel. 20.12. Acts 9.4. and his ſeruants beare witneſſe to the truth, and are ready to ſeale the ſame with their liues: And ſhall he not defend both it and them? Yes aſſuredly; for God hath promiſed protection of them both.
                  The truth of which doctrine ought to incourage and 
                        vse 1 confirme euery chriſtian man in the defence of gods truth, notwithſtanding the great enemies and oppoſitions againſt the ſame. We muſt not deny it in any caſe, not in any ſort forſake it: Buy it me may, but neuer ſell it at any rate,
                     Prou. 23.23. Coloſ. 27. for this is Iudas merchandize. We muſt labour to be rooted and eſtabliſhed in the truth, which may be blamed, but neuer ſhamed, nor yet forſaken of God and good men.
                  Likewiſe, it reproueth and condemneth all ſuch as are 
                        vse 2 wauering and vnconſtant in the defence thereof.Mat. 11.7. 
                     Iohn Baptiſt was no ſhaken Reed. A faithfull man is as the houſe built vpon the rocke, no ſtorme or ſhowre can ſhake it,Mat. 7.24.25. much leſſe ouerthrow it. Great is the force of the truth, and of the faithfull profeſſours thereof, which ſtill preuaile and get a conqueſt ouer all things.
                  
                     The cauſe of my ſoule:] That is,
                        Text.
                      the cauſe wherefore his life was in danger.
                  There is nothing more dangerous (many times in the world) then to defend and maintaine the truth of God.
                        Doctr.
                      
                     The defence of Gods truth is many times moſt dangerous. This is the cauſe of Ieremies ſoule, which called his very life into queſtion. The world hateth me (ſaith Chriſt) becauſe I teſtifie that the works are euil therof. Euery one that doth euill hateth the light. Many times it hazardeth liberty, life,Ioh. 7.7 & 3.20 and goods: Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake. It makes ſometimes a ſeperation betweene the neereſt and deereſt friends, Father and Sonne, Mother and Daughter.Luke 21.16.17·18. & 12.52 53· Ioh. 9.21.22.34 The poore blinde man (once belieuing and defending the truth)

is not onely excommunicate of the Church,Iohn 12.42. but caſt off by his parents; they leaue him and the cauſe; yea, euery one that confeſſe Chriſt openly are caſt out: Paul became an enemy to the Galathians,
                     Gal. 4.15. becauſe he told them the truth.
                  
                     
                        reason 1 The reaſon hereof is Sathans rage againſt it: it is the ſword that ſlayeth him,Sathans rage againſt it. and the mighty weapons that caſt downe his ſtrong holds; by it he is driuen out of poſſeſſion,2 Cor. 10.4.5. and falleth from heauen like lightening; he can haue no roome in the Church nor place in the harts of Gods choſen,Luke 10.18. for the preaching of the truth.
                  
                     
                        reason 2 Another reaſon is, the corruption and malice of mans heart,The corruption and malice of mans heart. which oppoſeth againſt it, in maintaining things vnlawfull, which the word of truth condemneth. And here begin the warres, euery one ſtriueth for his luſts and to haue his owne will,Iames 4.1. Iob 4.12. which it reproueth. It is a ſword, a ſacrificing knife, a hammer, a fire, to kill, conquer, and conſume whatſoeuer euill in is our nature,Ier. 23.28.29. whether in reaſon, iudgement, or practiſe.
                  
                     
                        
                           Ʋſe.
                     The vſe, is to teach vs to be prepared, and to pray to God, that we may be ſtrengthned againſt all the dangers and perſecutions which vſually follow the ſound profeſſion of the goſpell, the word of truth. We muſt reſolue to ſell all,Math. 13.45.46 not onely for the buying, but keeping of this pretious pearle, which will proue the richeſt marchandiſe. It is beſt to caſt our accompts for the building of this glorious tower,Luke 14.28.31. and to muſter our beſt forces for theſe ſpirituall warres; that we may be conquerours, and not ouercommed: Wee are not in this ſpirituall fight, to wreſtle againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt principalities and powers, we had neede therefore to be well harneſſed with the whole armour of God,
                        Text.
                      that we may be able to ſtand to our 
                        doctrine 12 tackling, and ſtanding faſt ouercome.
                  
                     God maintaineth both the cauſe and perſon of ſuch as defend his truth.
                     God not only maintained his cauſe, but redeemed his life.
                  
                  Laſtly, from hence we may learne the ſafety and ſecurity of all Gods ſeruants, that doe their beſt endeauor to mainetaine Gods cauſe and truth. In their greateſt perils,

he keepeth them ſafe and ſound; he maintaineth Ieremies cauſe, and redeemeth his life: for the proofe and vſes they are all one with doctrine 1.
                  Thus hauing briefely vnfolded the ſecret vertues of theſe two ſoueraigne receipts (the Word and Prayer) to be moſt cordiall and comfortable in our variety of afflictions and greateſt tryals:
                        Concluſion.
                      The one to inſtruct vs in the lawfull meanes that we are to vſe, and to moderate our violent paſſions, and vnruly affections, that (howſoeuer) with patience we may poſſeſſe our ſoules: and alſo, for as much as our knowledge proueth very weake (for the moſt part,) or not ſo ſanctified that the encreaſe thereof can alwayes ſted vs in it ſelfe; the other preſcription of prayer is neceſſarily to be adioyned, without the which the beſt ordinances of God, themſelues will be vnfruitfull. And therefore for the right vſe of our knowledge (by the holy miniſtery of the word) and the ſtrengthening of our faith and hope, whereby we may be inabled to perſeuere vnto the end: wee had more then need continually to practiſe our ſelues in this holy duty: That ſo being armed by the word, and ſupported by faithfull prayer, wee may be alwaies furniſhed in our chriſtian warfare, to fight the good fight of faith, and ſo to attaine the end thereof, which is the ſaluation of our ſoules.
