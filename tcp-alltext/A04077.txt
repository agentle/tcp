            28 All Captaines shall be diligent in training their Companies, and shall be carefull in gouerning them well, and in prouiding for them, and also shall see in all Seruices that they doe the dueties of Souldiers, as they will hope for fauour and aduancement,

or escape ignominious displacing from their charges.
            29 All Captaines or other Officers, that for the time shall haue Command of Companies, shall see their Companies doe orderly Quarter as they are appointed, and to entrench or fortifie as much of the Quarter as they are appointed, and as they are commanded, vpon paine of losse of their places.

And as I forbid all men vnder my rule to renew any old quarels, or to begin any new, so I do acquite and discharge all men that shall haue quarell

offered to them, or chalenges made to them of any disgrace, or opinion of any disaduantage, since they doe but doe the dueties of Souldiers which ought to subiect themselues to Martiall discipline, and they that prouoke them shalbe proceeded withal as breakers of all good Discipline, and enimies to the good successes of the Seruice.
            33 And because drunkennesse is the mother of many other vices and disorders in Armies, euery Souldier or Officer that shall be found drunke, shall bee committed to prison for the first offense: And if he fall into it the second time, being a priuate Souldier, hee shall besides his imprisonment forfeit two moneths pay: if he bee an Officer, he shall loose his place: The third time shall haue such farre greater punishment as a Martials Court shall set downe.

their slacknesse, and be censured at a Marshals Court.
            37 All other faults, disorders and offences that are not mentioned in these Articles shalbe punished according to the generall Customes and Lawes of Warres, and therefore I command all men to looke to their charge: and him that hath no charge to looke to his owne carriage, and to keepe himselfe within bands of duetie: for the discipline of Warre shall be strictly kept, and the Lawes thereof seuerely executed.
