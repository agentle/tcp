the World, who as yet mislike it, onely because they misknow it.

And which yet is most of all, hereunto is ioyned the puritie and integritie of your

hands, whereby all things are ruled. Your Highnesse hath not liued like an Achab

Your Maiestie might shake the lappe with Nehemiah against oppressours, in signe and token of innocencie. Your Highnesse might cast the first stone at adulterers, & in a good conscience could make purgation with Samuel, if so it were that your Highnesse came to bee iudged of man, Whose Oxe or Asse haue I taken, or to whome haue I done wrong, If th

               re be any fault (for the best want not their own blemishes) it is vpon that extremity,

which is neerest to vertue: Namely, in too great mercie and clemencie, which of old was noted for an infirmitie in good Theodosius, Quod ex mansuetudine in nimiam lenitatem declinauerït, yet euen of this will I say with Nazian. Etiam haec est dei humanitas & Clementia. This also is a resemblance of the clemencie of God, whose deputie on earth your Highnes are, for hee is gracious, slow to wrath, long suffering and ready to forgiue. Many a time he bends his bowe to shoote at the wicked, the arrowes of his anger, but is

                slowe and loath to let them go: Yea, oftimes hee shoots & purposely misseth his marke, sparing yet for a time:

               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , his warnings are many, but where they worke not, hee strikes at length, and no more but once. 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : Thus euē the Lord whose mercie is marueilous, meanes him to iudgement▪ where mercie is abused: It is no pietie but superstition to spare, when time is to strike. And it is a cruell clemencie, which is declared vpon one with the destruction of manie. The Pillars which vphold a Kingdome, are Mercie and Iustice, since by them Kinges are conserued, Your Highnesse out of your rare wisedome, will haue a care to conserue them both, that neither Mercie make preiudice to Iustice, nor Iustice againe take away the praise of Mercie.
            
               But to returne, as S

                  desprima & vita ima, are most vnseemely; so is the dignity doubled, where the preferment is beautified with pietie: and herein also hath the Lord magnified his mercie toward your Maiesty, that as by an high calling he hath exalted your Highnesse a Head & Ruler ouer this Mightie people, so hath hee made your Highnesse no lesse eminent by communication of his grace, then your Maiestie is by the Honor of the place, liuing in the eyes of all men a patterne of Vertue, yea an image of the heauenly King, walking so among the euill that you are not infected with their vice, and so with the good that the best are made better by your example. God make vs

wise to know what wee haue, for because the Lord hath loued his people, therefore hath hee set such a King ouer them, to rule them with equitie and righteousnesse. The Lord make vs thankefull for it, and long may your Highnes liue & raign a happy king of many blessings to your people, Amen.

               Why, what meane you by that?

               Because many trauelled in these partes where you haue beene hauing returned worse then they went a field.
            
            
               R.
               Wherein worse?
            
            
               C.
               With the botch of Aegypt in their bodie, the iust plague of God for corporall whoredome; and the leprosie of Babel in their soules, wherewith God also punisheth thē who loue not Sions beautie, and delight not in the light of the Gospell.

               But I was neither in Aegypt nor in Babel.
               
            
            
               C.

               C.
               I would you did, for so you might easily see that Rome is Spirituall Aegypt, wherin the light of God is obscured: and Babel, wherein is a fearefull captiuitie of Gods people, and such a horrible confusion of languages, that when the Builder speaks, the people vnderstands not what he sayes: yea it is Sodom, which for her vile abhominations will shortly bee burnt with fire, and brought to vtte

               Let mee alone, I see you are stil in your old humour, and it maruels me much, that so many in this Land being conuerted to the bosome of the mother Church of Rome, you should still continue in this new Hereticall opinion.

               O now I see the bile of Babel vpon you: you will call her a mother Church whom God cals a mother of Whoredomes, and you charge vs with noueltie, and heresie; but wee will proue by Gods grace, what you call heresie, and noueltie is veritie and antiquitie.
            
            
               R.
               Antiquitie say you, fie, speake neuer of it: for your eldest Doctours are Luther, and Caluin.
               
            
            
               C.
               Nay by your leaue (Sir)
                  
wee haue neither our faith from Luther, nor from Caluin: but answere you as the Apostle Saint Paul answered his aduersaries, when they charged him with the like crimes that you charge vs with, and I pray you marke his Apologie:
                     Act. 24.14. 
                  I confesse that after the way which they call Heresie, so worship I the Lord God of my Fathers.
               
            
            
               R.
               What euer Saint Paul speakes, I would not haue you speaking of Fathers, seeing you haue forsaken the Religion of your Fathers.
            
            
               C.
               You deceiue your selfe if you thinke wee wil not stand to the Religion of our Fathers.
            
            
               R.
               Ah, but your Fathers were Papists.
            
            
               C.
               Nay but our Fathers were Protestants.
            
            
               
               R.
               Now in good faith you moue me to laughter.
            
            
               C.
               You may laugh as you list, but haue no cause.
            
            
               R.
               VVas not your Father, and Grandfather, and their Fathers before them for many ages Papists?
            
            
               C.
               What of that? they who in regard of time and truth were long before them, and should be followed as Fathers to vs and them both, were Protestants.
            
            
               R.
               That is but a shift of your owne.
            
            
               C.
               It is no shift, it is a truth; and you shall see it your selfe if you will consider who were Pauls Fathers, whom he saies he followed in the worshipping of God.
            
            
               R.
               What were the names of

his Fathers were I cannot tell, but I see they haue been Israelites of the Tribe of Beniamin.
               
            
            
               C.
               We haue not that to stand vpon, what they were for their persons, or names either, but what was their Religion: remember you not that hee sayes himselfe, he was brought vp at the feet of Gamali

               R.
               Yea I doe.
            
            
               C.
               Tell mee now of what Religion was Gamali
                        •
                     l?
               
            
            
               R.
               I see he hath been a Pharesie.
            
            
               C.
               And think you that Saint Paul when hee made his Apologie, worshipped God after the manner of Pharesies?
            
            
               R.
               I thinke it not.
            
            
               C.
               How then sayes hee, that he worshipped God after the

maner of his Fathers, seeing his Fathers were Pharesies?
            
            
               R.
               I thinke he meanes not of these fathers, who liued last before him, but transcending them he passes vp to his elder fathers Abraham, Isaack, Iacob.
               
            
            
               C.
               Was hee not then wrongfully accused of noueltie, as one who had forsaken the religion of his fathers, because hee forsooke the Religion of such Fathers as liued last before him?
            
            
               R.
               I thinke so indeede: His Apologie cleares him sufficiently both of heresie and noueltie, which his aduersaries would haue imputed to him.
            
            
               C.
               Now (Sir) I haue you where I would: why should not the like Apologie cleare vs in the like case: for albeit we haue

foresaken the heresies of Papistrie maintained by them, that liued last before vs, yet doe wee worship the Lord our God, as these fathers did, whom Iustin Martyr call
                     •
                  s, Patres Patrum, & whom with him we will prefer to any posterior fathers whatsoeuer.
            
            
               R.
               That cannot be, seeing it is known, it is not threescore yeers since your Religion came into this Country.
            
            
               C.
               No (Sir) I will make known to you, that it is 1500 yeeres since this same Religion preached and professed now, was then preached and professed by our Ancient fathers. The first Religion that euer we had was gentilisme, our fathers worshipped Diana, the Sun, the Moone, the Starres.
            
            
               
               R.
               That was a pittifull blindnesse.
            
            
               C.
               So it was indeed: but in the first hundreth yeere we embraced Christianity, and eight hundreth yeere after Christ, we were infected with Papistrie, and now againe hath God called vs by the light of the gospel to our ancient Religion of Christianity, whereby wee worshippe the Father in his sonne according to his word, and no other way.
            
            
               R.
               You speake faire enough to it, be as it will; but if it be true that you say, then would you be in communion with the Catholike Church.
            
            
               C.
               And so thanks to God we are, reioycing as I said vnto you, that the Lord by his Gospell hath called vs to bee Christian Catholikes.
            
            
               
               R.
               That is also
                     •
                   a new stile of your owne, that you will bee called Christian Catholikes.
               
            
            
               C.
               If you were acquainted with antiquity, you would not call it new, with many such nouelties you charge vs, which are indeed ancient truthes: it is eleuen hundreth yeeres since in the seuenth Councell of Carthage, professors of the Gospell were called Catholike Christians.
            
            
               R.
               But to let the style passe, how can you say, you are in cō
                  munion with the Catholike Church, seeing you haue made separation
                     •
                   from the Romane Church, and refuse to bee stiled Roman Catholikes?
            
            
               C.
               The Romane Church in her best estate was neuer more but a member of the Catholike

Church, and there is no more reason to cal the Roman church the Catholike Church, nor to say, that Rome is all Italy, or Pa

                  an Church hath plaied the Whore, made a shameful Apostasie from her first estate, wee haue done no wrong in seperating from her: but for our warrant haue Gods owne Proclamation commanding vs to doe so.
            
            
               R.
               Where haue you that Proclamation?
            
            
               C.
               There it is, Come out of Babell my people.
               
            
            
               R.
               But no word is there of Rome
               
            
            
               C.
               I shall proue to you that this Babel is Rome, and your own Doctors cannot deny it.
            
            
               
               R.
               If you make all good you haue said, I will say no more, but there is many one beguiled.
            
            
               C.
               If you will heare mee by Gods grace I shall make it good.
            
            
               R.
               I will not refuse to heare you, and I trust also to answere you.
            
            
               C.
               It is not me you shall hear, but the voice of the Gospell, which if it were heard at Rome, I am of that mind, the Popes kingdome should not long continue.
            
            
               R.
               It will bee hard for you to get hearing there.
            
            
               C.
               And why? since Sodomits there haue their brothels, and Iewes haue their Synagogues, wherein they curse Christ, why may not Protestants bee tolerated to haue a Church wherein to preach?
            
            
               
               R.
               Good sooth they loue you worse then any of them.
               I thinke it true; for on

                   Deuill can dwell well inough with an other, yea a legion of them in one man, but none of them will giue place to Christ. But tell me how long, God willing, mind you to stay in this towne?
            
            
               R.
               I hope to be in it all this weeke.

               Then I pray you, let vs spare euery day one howre or two for conference, and I will come to you to your owne chamber.
            
            
               R.
               Agreed am I, and let our conference to morow continue about antiquitie, for I think it somewhat strange that you should pretend it.

               Well. let it be so.
            
            
               
               THE FIRST DAYES CONFERENCE. Concerning Antiquitie in General.
               
                  R. 
                  WElcome (Sir) I see you are a true man, and keepe promise.
               
                  C.
                  What I am not in good faine would I be.
               
               
                  R.
                  Thinke you not best we begin where wee left yesternight?
               
               
                  C.
                  Yea indeede.
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  What say you then of Antiquitie? will you not graunt that to bee the true Church which hath the most auncient Doctrine?
               
               
                  C.
                  That is a thing out of all question; the Doctrine which is most ancient I embrace, and beleeue to be most true.
               
               
                  R.
                  You will myre your selfe incontinent, for these which yee call corruptions in the Church of Rome, some of them will be found a thousand yeares old.
               
               
                  C.
                  What is that to the matter? Seeing the truth whereby we condemne these corruptions will be found elder then they, and wee, to speake with Vincentius, wil euer preferre the olde Faith to new vnfaithfulnesse: for if you thinke this a

good Argument: Such a doctrine or ceremonie should be receiued, because it is one thousand and two hundred yeares old, then by the same reason the heresies of Simon Magus must bee receiued for a truth, because they were taught by him one thousand and sixe hundred yeares since.
               
               
                  R.
                  But said you not euen now, you would acknowledge that to be most true which is most ancient?
               
               
                  C.
                  I say that same yet; And that you may conceiue it the better, I pray you consider that truth and errour, suppose they came not of the same parents, yet in regard of time they are like two twinnes, but the vantage of time that is, truth hath

it, suppose very little.
               
               
                  R.
                  I pray you let me heare that at more length, for I see it will greatly helpe to cleare this point.
               
               
                  C.
                  Will you goe vp to the Church in Paradise, and you shall see the first voice that sounded there was Gods voice: For in the first two Chapters of Genesis, you will heare nothing but Deus dixit, God said: but incontinent in the third Chapter comes in, Et Serpens dixit, and the Serpent said.
               
               
                  R.
                  I see that clearely.
               
               
                  C.
                  And I am glad you doe so: But I pray you consider, wil any man be so mad as to thinke that Sathans lies shall bee receiued for a truth, because they are now neere sixe thousand yeares old?
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  It were no reason indeed, because albeit his lies 
                        •
                     ee olde, yet (as you haue said) there is a Truth elder.
               
               
                  C.
                  I pray you remember that, that it may confirme you against the craft of Sathan, when hee would couer errour with a shew of Antiquitie.
               
               
                  R.
                  I hope to doe so.
               
               
                  C.
                  Now will yee come down againe to the dayes of Christ Iesus; may you not see that when our Lord sent out his Apostles, Sathan also sent out his false Apostles▪ and when Simon Peter comes out to Preach the Gospell, Simon Magus is stirred vp to Preach heresies?
               
               
                  R.
                  I see that also.
               
               
                  C.
                  Then let vs agree in this, since Truth is to bee sought

from our fathers according as we are commanded, Enquire for the good and olde way; we will goe seeke it from our most ancient fathers.
               
               
                  R.
                  Truely it caries with it I thinke a reason, that we should not be mooued with the opinion of any father, where they varie from the doctrine of the first fathers.
               
               
                  C.
                  You▪ speake now as you should, and as before I shewed you was the mind of that ancient father Iustine Martyr:
                        Quest. 119 when it was obiected to him, such a father thought such a thing, he answered, Sed pater patrum Apostolus aliter sensit: And herein to confirme you, if controuersies of Religion were decided, as our Sauiour decided the question

of Polygamie, the debate betweene vs and the Romish Church were soone ended.
               
               
                  R.
                  How did Christ resolue that contro

                     ersie of Polygamie?
                  
               
               
                  C.

                     It is a propertie of Christian modestie not to deliuer their owne things to the after-commers, but to keepe things receiued from their fore-beers.

                  Hee is expounding heere he Apostles words: If I, or an Angell from heauen should bring to you another doctrine, then that which yee haue receiued, let him be accursed.

In the thirteenth Session of the Councell of Constance, as is Recorded by Carranza one of your owne, and Registred in your Canon Law, there is an Act made of this tenour.

                         specie, tamen haec consuetudo ad euitandum aliqua pericula, & scandala, est rationa

tantummodo sub specie panis suscipiatur. Albeit in the Primitiue Church, this Sacrament was receiued of the faithful vnder both the kinds, yet to eschewe some perils and offences, this custome now with very good reason is brought in, that the Priest should receiue it vnder both the kinds, but the people should receiue the bread onely, and not the cup. What thinke yee now of this place? Hath not the Church of Rome here deliuered a Doctrine which shee hath not receiued? Is there not heere a manifest changing of Christs ordinance, and by their owne confession a plaine departing from Antiquitie? What thinke you of this one instance?
               
               
                  R.
                  I will aduise vpon it.

                  He was a French-man, he writ this Treatise in the fiue hundreth yeare of Christ, and heere it is Translated by Ninian Winzet, a Masse-priest of the Church of Rome, which yee cannot refuse.

                        um serua, which in all good reason should binde his successors: Thus hee expounds it: Keepe that which is committed to thee, not that which is inuented by thee: which thou hast receiued, not which thou hast imagined: wherein thou art no Author, inuenter, sorger, but a keeper; not a Law-maker but a Law-keeper; not a guide, but a follower: saue that which is giuen thee, saue the talent of Catholick faith vnbroken, vncorrupt: what thou hast receiued, render it againe, if thou hast receiued Gold, render Gold againe; slippe not in one thing in stead of an other, for Gold lay not downe lead, nor brasse.

                  R.
                  I know that.
               
               
                  C.
                  Hee commanded Timothie, and all others his successors in the worke of the Ministerie to doe the like.
               
               
                  R.
                  And good reason so they should.
               
               
                  C.
                  Then there is the point; How is it that the Church of Rome takes on her this libertie to doe otherwise?
               
               
                  R.
                  Wherein doe they otherwise?
               
               
                  C.
                  Haue you forgot so soone?

Saint Paul deliuered to the people as wel the Cup as the Bread, because hee receiued it from Christ Iesus: how is it then that the Church of Rome takes away the Cup from the people?
               
               
                  R.
                  Why? May not the Church make Lawes?
               
               
                  C.
                  No such Lawes as derogate to Christs Lawes, for in that sense you heard Vincentius denie that they are Law-makers, but Law-keepers: I pray you giue place to the truth, and consider how little cause they haue to bragge of Antiquitie, who dare make the like of that; Albeit Christ and his Apostles, and the Primitiue Church did this, yet we for good causes will doe oth

                  And so I wish from my heart it may be: But I pray you consider as in one Sacrament you are guiltie of sacrilegious paring, so in both you are guiltie of sacrilegious adding and changing: and so cannot

                  R.
                  How So?
               
               
                  C.
                  As yee haue taken Wine from the Bread, so yee haue added Water to the Wine, which is a new inuention and forgerie, albeit your Doctours to excuse it cast it on Alexander the first, yet it is certain, it was not in Christs institution, and by your owne confessions was brought in many yeares after Christ, and so should bee reiected as a noueltie.
               
               
                  R.
                  That is but a smal thing, and there may be many reasons to excuse it.
               
               
                  C.
                  No: not one; Let no man bee wiser then God. Who dare adde to the ordinance of Christ?

But you haue done worse in Baptisme adding Spittle, Oyle, and Salt to the element of Water: was this done by Christ or his Apostles? You father the Oyle vpon Siluester, but confesse it was not vsed in the Church in Baptisme before him, and so it is an other ancient noueltie.
               
               
                  R.
                  It may bee they haue thought good to vse these for reasons and respects which I know not; but this pertaines not to the substance of Baptisme, and can not annull it.
               
               
                  C.
                  I graunt they doe not annull Baptisme, yet are they inexcusable, who in the smallest thing dare alter the institution of Christ: Are not his Sacraments the Seales of his couenant?
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  I confesse they are.

                      onely to bee about these things, you shall know that, except the Article of the Trinitie, the Church of Rome hath left no Article of our Faith vncorrupted, so that it is most certaine, This Church of Rome with the doctrine, and iurisdiction nowe maintained by her, was not in the Primitiue Church.
               
               
                  R.
                  O but I wil tell you what I once heard concerning that matter, from one of their Doctors: That there is a great difference

betweene a Church in her infancie, and her older and riper age: For as it growes in age, so may it and should it increase in many things which it had not in the infancie thereof.
               
               
                  C.
                  Nowe I see you speake from such knowledge, as the great labours of the Iesuites workes in the hearts of their captiues, and because it is your last and greatest defence, I will let you still see out of the words of Vincentius, which you will like better then mine, that this makes nothing for you.
               
               
                  R.
                  Come on let vs see; what sayes Vincentius?
                  
               
               
                  C.

                  R.
                  That is a strange distinction,

and yet so honest, that in truth I dare not gaine-say it.
               
               
                  C.
                  Heare him then; hee expounds the two parts of his distinction: To encrease (saith he) is when a thing biding in it selfe is more amplified: To change, is when a thing going out of it selfe is translated & turned into an other. To make this cleare, hee illustrates it by a proper similitude: Let (sayes hee) the Religion of soules follow the nature of bodies, which albe
                           •
                        t in processe of yeres they grow, yet they remaine the same: the same members, the same Ioyntes are in Children which are in Men, though in the one stronger and greater, in the other smaller and weaker: but if the shape bee turned in any forme not of the owne kind, or any thing bee eked to the number

of the members, or taken from the same, then either the body perisheth, or becomes monstrous, or at the least becomes weake. So in Religion, if wee shall begin to mixe noueltie with Antiquitie, we shall make the Church a brothell of filthie and abominable errours, which before was a Temple of chaste and vndefiled veritie, where as the Church of Christ should bee a diligent keeper of the doctrine deliuered to it, changing nothing, diminishing nothing, adding nothing. Now these are the words of Vincentius, and I demand of you out of the light of your conscience if you can gaine-say them.

                  In truth it is a pretie discourse, and I embrace all that he hath said as a truth.

what yee wil say for the Church of Rome, since it can not bee denied they haue changed, diminished, and added to the ancient Catholicke faith: Some ceremonies and opinions they haue which Antiquitie knewe not, & some the ancient Church had, which they haue pared away, and in a word haue so change, that in Rome is nothing anci

                  That seemes very hard: For, though in some ceremonies there bee adding, paring, and chaunging, yet I can not thinke it is in substance.

                  You are farre deceiued, for they haue made a change in the substance.

                  The more wise are you, for it is by Christs blood Onely,
                     
that reconciliation is made. But what thinke yee of confidence, should wee put considence in any but in God?

                  C.
                  Then I will tell you: Twelue hundreth yeares after Christ, Gratian a Benedictine Monke, gathered together the sentences of Councels, Fathers, and Popes, concerning sundrie matters of Religion, and set it forth, which is commonly called Decretum; and after him certain Popes, as Gregory the ninth, Boniface the eight, Clemens the fift, Iohn the twentie two, following

the example of Gratian, haue gathered the like: These are called Decretals, and Extrauagants added to Decretum; all of them make vp the Canon law, which now must bee equalled with the word, and all to bee receiued, as if Peter his owne mouth had pronounced them. Is not this against the golden rule of Vincentius, to mixe noueltie with Antiquitie; What say you to it?

                  In truth I can not iudge of that which I know not.

But to return to things of great importance, I assure you the onely question and controuersie in Religion this day may be taken vp in this question: Is Iesus the Sonne of Mary the Christ? Or as the Baptist takes it vp, Art thou hee who is come, or shall wee looke for an other?

more but a sister Church vnto vs. The next day God willing I wil shew you that the Church of Rome is Apostatique now, not like that Church of olde, which the Apostle commended, and is not onely a Whoore her selfe, but the mother of Whooredomes.

                  No (Sir) I will be loath to burden you with multitude of words, but shall bee very well content, when you heare any point wherein weight is, that

you warne me to cleare it.

                  Well, I shall doe so God willing.

                        ricke: Christianity was first conueied to them by Marke the Euangelist, and the Eunuch of Ethiopia, whom Philip baptised: And I can let you see (but that I shall disgresse ouer farre) that fiue hūdreth yeres after Christ the Churches of Africke would not acknowledge the Bishop of Rome their superiour.
               
               
                  R.
                  Our question is not now concerning them: for I knowe the Church of Rome receiued

her faith from the Churches of Asia, and they of Asia receiued it not from the Church of Rome. And as to them of Africke, whatsoeuer is disputable, there wee leaue it as not pertaining to our present puropse.
               
               
                  C.
                  Oh good Sir, you will grant then that the Church of Rome is farre posterior to the Churches of A

                  R.
                  That I can not denie: But the Churches of Europe, and specially these of the west parts were first conuerted to Christ by the Church of Rome.
               
               
                  C.
                  No (Sir) yee are deceiued in that also, and this is the point wherein I am to contradict you.
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  I am sure you will not contradict mee, without some warrant.
               
               
                  C.
                  That were no reason: I will let you see that the most famous Churches of Europe (as their Records testifie) had not their faith from the Church of Rome, and then I will come to our owne.
               
               
                  R.
                  I think long to heare that.
               
               
                  C.
                  And I will delay you no longer. In the Councel of Trent, there was a great question betweene the French and Spanish Prelates, about the first place: The greatest Argument that any of them vsed, was from the Antiquitie of their Christianitie, which none of them alleadged, they had from the Church of Rome, albeit at that time

both of them sought the Popes fauour.
               
               
                  R.
                  From whence got they it then, if they got it not from Rome?
               
               
                  C.
                  The Spaniards alleadged, they were made Christians by Saint Iames, who after hee had Preached the Gospell in Spaine, returned to Palestina, and was president of that famous Councell holden at Ierusalem, Act. 15 then being Martyred, his bones were brought to Compostella, and there buried. The French replied that their narration was fabulous, and that it is more likely, if any Apostle came to Spaine, hee came rather by land to France, and so taught them by the way, then otherwise by Sea: And if any credit might be

giuen to such traditions, they could also with more probabilitie alledge that Lazarus, and Nathaniel taught the Gospell among them▪ & this at that time they spake for themselues. But out of more certaine Storie this might bee said also for them, th

                  Either yee must grant the Church of Rome was not conuerted by Saint Peter, or then there was no Church there before the fortie one yeare after our Lord, at which time Saint Peter came to it.

May you not see wee are not inferiour to any Christian Countrie in this part of the World, and that we haue as many cleare witnesses of our Ancient Christian faith, as any nation of Europe hath for them?

                  You may see the contrarie, by that which I haue said alreadie; and I will yet make it more cleare to you. The first King of the South part of the Isle that embraced the Christian faith, was Lucius, in the y

we agree ioyntly to contend with the Church of Rome: what part of the Isle God did first illuminate with his light is nothing to the matter: If it was their glorie to haue the Sunne of righteousnesse first shining on them, wee enuie it not; this is sufficient: the Lord had a Church here in this Isle as soon as in Rome, and neither they nor wee had our faith from Rome; and if

I haue prooued; seeing wee are but three yeares in Christianitie behinde Rome, thinke you in so small time they did so encrease, that they spread out their branches to the vttermost parts of the earth? Yea, rather if you will reade the Storie, you shall finde that for three hundreth yeares (wherein are many three yeares) they were so vexed by the persecutors, that they could not get their owne Church stablished; as after it was when God relented the persecution.

frō the Latine or West Church.
               
               
                  R.
                  Nowe that is the point, and I pray you once cleare it: for I thinke if you euince that, the Church of Rome in her best estate hath beene vnto vs a sister Church, but no mother church.
               
               
                  C.
                  My first Argument is from Petrus Cluniacensis Abbas, writing to Bernard, who affirmes that for seuen or eight hundred yeares after Christ, the Scottishmen did celebra
                           •
                        e the Passeouer all this time after the Grecian maner, not aster the Romane.

                  C.
                  Then I will tell you it. Soone after the dayes of the Apostles, there happened a controuersie betweene the Churches of the East and West, about the celebration of the

Passeouer: They of the East did obserue it the fourteenth day of the Moone, that same day wherein the Iewes kept their Passeouer: They againe of the West, thinking they would haue no communion with the Iewes, did celebrate it the next Sabboth after the fourteenth day. Polïcrates, with the orientall Bishops, alledged the authoritie of Iohn, Philip, Policarp, yea the prescript of the Euangell for their warrant. Victor, and the Bishops of the West alledged for their warrant, Saint Peter, Saint Paul: Such as were more moderate, misliked to see a Schisme in the Church for so small a matter: Irenaeus iudgeth, Obseruationes ill

                  R.
                  Truely it was a lamentable thing, to see so sore a renting of the Church, for so small a cause.
               
               
                  C.
                  It was indeede: and yet that in this controuersie, the Churches of Britaine obserued the manner of the Easterne Church, it is an argument they reuerenced the East Church for their mother, from whome the grace of the Gospell had come to them.
               
               
                  R.
                  It is indeede likely: If

these Churches had beene planted by Romish Doctors, they would haue also receiued the Romish ceremonies.
               
               
                  C.
                  But there is yet an other Argument:
                        Histor. Britan. lib. 8. cap. 4. 
                     Galsrid the Cardinall in his Storie of Britaine, which hee wrote in the seuen hundreth yeare, witnesseth that the Britans would not receiue Augustinus Iunior,

Cap. 2. the Legate of Gregorie the great, nor yet acknowledge any primacie of the Bishop of Rome ouer them: An euident argument they esteemed not the Romish Church to be their Mother Church. To cleare this you shall know that in the sixt hundreth yeare Gregorius magnus sent into England Augustinus Iunior, to perswade the Church there to receiue the

Romish ceremonies, which to that day they had not knowne; as Altars, Images, Vestiments; Crosses, wherein albeit hee had not such speedie successe as hee would, yet at length did he obtaine it, and intended also to effect the like in the Church of Scotland,
                     
                        Cent. 6. li. 5. cap. 17. but was strongly resisted by Daganus, and Columbanus, Qui nullam in ritibus mutationem admittere voluerunt. Againe in the seuen hundreth yeare a great schisme was in the church of Britaine: some refusing the Ceremonies of the Romish Church, keeping still their ancient custome; for the which they pretended the authoritie of Saint Iohn the Evangelist: Others againe embracing the Romish ceremonies▪ which part

waxed the stronger, in that King Osuvius inclined to them. Alway the matter was debated with so hot contention, that from words it came to wepons, and twelue hundreth Church-men were slain that refused the Romish Ceremonies: this is all the good the Britaine Church got from the Popes Legate; yet the euill rested not heere, for at length in the eight hundreth yeare, by th

                  Will you make mee this promise, to quit your communion with the Church of Rome, if I proue her to be the Whore of Babel, the mother of Whoredomes?
               
               
                  R.
                  I thinke it were good reason: for I see what euer that Babel may be, much euill is spoken of it, and all Gods people are commaunded to goe out of Babel, with certification, if they will not, they shall be partakers of her plagues.

                  Goe to then, we will first lay this for a ground, that Babel here is not to be taken literally, neither for Babel in Egypt called now Cayrus, nor yet for Babel in

                     ooth I cānot think it a solid Commentarie: for this Whoore of Babel is said to make all Nations drunken with the wine of her fornications, & it is a hard speech to say that the vniversall companie of the reproba

                  C.
                  You take it vp very wisely: And yet that they themselues speake this without any certaine knowledge it appeares by that, which they say Cap. 17.

18. these are their words: if this great Citie be meant of any one Citie, and not of the vniuersall companie of the reprobate &c. it is likely to be Olde Rome till the dayes of Constantine. And againe vpon the fift verse of that same Chapter they say: The first persecuting Emperours were but figures of Antichrist, and it may wel be that the great Antichrist shall sit in Rome also as his figures sate in Rome.
                  
               
               
                  R.
                  Say the Rhemists, that it may verie well bee that Antichrist shall sit in Rome?
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  Yea forsooth, looke their owne words.
               
               
                  R.
                  I haue no skill of that: I neuer heard but that he should be a Iew of the Tribe of Dan, and should sit in Ierusalem.
                  
               
               
                  
                  C.
                  That is so vncertaine a fable that (as you see) themselues cannot leane to it, and their speech for vs is plaine enough, it may very well bee (say they) that Antichrist shall sit at Rome. But to proceed in our purpose, this exposition called Communis expositio, is reiected by their own companions.

                  I thinke they haue reason to say so: but after what manner doe they expound Babel?

                        De Pont. Rom. lib. 2. cap. 2. 
                     Bellarmine not onely confesseth Babel is Rome, but proues it by the testimonie of ancient fathers.
                        In Apo. 14. 
                     Ribera thus, Romae conueniunt aptissimè omnia quae de Babylone dicuntur hoc libro, atqueillud imprimis,

quod alij conuenire non potest: Septem capita, septem sunt montes. Whatsoeuer in this book is spoken of Babel, agrees most properly to Rome, especially that which can agree to none other, the Seuen heads are seuen hils.
               
               
                  R.
                  That is plaine talke: Indeed I haue heard much shifting about these hils, and one of thē
                     selues said to mee that these seuen hils signifie seauen deadly sinnes, all to this end to denie that this Prophecie points out Rome, but I neuer heard it confessed before so clearly.
               
               
                  C.
                  You may well say it: for the Rhemists charge the Protestants with madnes for expounding the Seuen heads seuen hils; they should impute madnesse to their owne fellowes, and not

to vs, for they are forced to confesse that this Babel is Rome, and the Seuen heads seuen hils, wherein the whoore sits.
               
               
                  R.
                  In truth I see they haue the weakest end of the string; some of them denying Babel to be Rome; some of them not only granting, but proouing it.
               
               
                  C.
                  But because I will hide nothing from you, you shall heare what distinctions they vse: Bellarmine saith, by Babel is meant Ethnica Roma sub Imperatoribus, Ethnique Rome vnder Emperors. Viega againe he saies,

this but comes (as Ribera also doth) and takes vp both the opinions.
                        In Apocal. 14. 
                     Quicquid mali de Româ scribitur in hac Apocalypsi, vel ad tempus illud spectat, quo gentilibus Imperatoribu

                        cerit. Whatsoeuer euill is spoken of Rome in this Apocalyps pertaines either to that Rome which was subiect to Ethnique Emperours, or to that Rome which will make defection from the Bishop of Rome and cast him out of their Citie: for they grant that their Bishop will bee cast out of Rome, that Rome will bee vtterly ruinated, & yet say they euen then when there shall not bee such a thing as Rome, y
                        •
                     t their Pope shall be Bishop of Rome: what thinke you of this stuffe? see you not

how they reele? some of them saye Rome was Babel, some of them say it will bee Babel; none of them can denie that this Babel spoken of by Saint Iohn, the chiefe seat and Citie of Antichrist, is Rome.
                  
               
               
                  R.
                  I thinke it goes very hard with them, when their best Doctors can say no more in defence of Rome, but it was Babel, or it will be Babel, that is, either Antichrist sate there, or will sett there.
               
               
                  C.
                  I hope you shall thinke much more before you goe: for now I will improue their distinction, and let you see it is not Ethnique Rome vnder Emperours, nor the Towne of Rome in the last time of the World, that here is called Babel but the

whorish Church of Rome gouerned by Apostated Popes.
               
               
                  R.
                  Make that cleare and the cause is wonne.

                        Babel in the Reuelation is not Ethnique Rome vnder Emperours, but Rome once Christian now corrupted vnder Popes.
                     
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  It is euident S. Iohn prophecies of the state of Rome as it will bee in the dayes of Antichrist, so sayes the Iesuite Viega▪ Haec est quarta visio huius operis; ea
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         illustrissima, & ad Antichristi tempora pertinens. So also sayes the Iesuite Ribera, a ca. 12. ad 21. Est huius libri pars secunda, & iota ad Antichristum, eius
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         tempora pertinet. But the dayes of persecuting Emperours, were not the dayes of Antichrist: if they

so say, they destroy all their owne doctrine concerning Antichrist, and therefore this prophecie of Babel, is not to bee vnderstood of the Ethnicke Rome vnder Emperours. Secondly, Ethnicke Rome as yet had not embraced the Gospell, and was not married with Christ, and therefore cannot be this Whore, which Carthusian their owne man expounds to be An adulterous Whore: You shall finde no people in holy Scripture charged with spirituall Whoredom, but such as haue beene married with Christ, none can bee Apostates from the faith, who neuer stoode in the faith, there must bee 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      before 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . This whoorish Babel then can not be Ethnicke Rome, vnmarried with

Christ. Seeing themselues doe grant it is Rome, it must bee Rome once Christian, but now corrupted: once Apostolicke standing in the faith, now Apostati
                        •
                     ke fallen from the faith. Thirdly, this Whore of Babel hath a cup in her hand full of abominations, and the filthines of her fornication
                        •
                     , wherewith shee makes drunken the inhabitants of the earth. By this golden cup Berengandus their owne man vnderstands, Documenta erroribus plena: And so this Babel can not signifie Rome vnder Emperors, who subdued the world by force of Sword and plaine violence, but must signifie Rome vnder Popes, which hath deceiued the world by false doctrine and lying myracles. Fourthly,

this Babel is called the mother of Whoredomes and abominations in the earth, which not onely her selfe hath played the Whoore, corrupting the true worship of God, but hath inforced her corruptions and superstitions vpon oth
                        •
                     rs. Now it is knowne that olde Rome sought no more but subiection of bodies, leauing the consciences of people free to any kind of worshippe they pleased: They subdued the Iewes, and forced them to pay tribute; but left them to their owne Religion: yea so farre were they from inforcing their superstitious worship vpon any nation, that by the contrarie themselues were infected with the superstitions of all nations, as is euident by

their Pantheon, which they erected in the honour of all Gods. And so it is not Ethnicke Rome vnder Emperours which heere is called the Mother of whoredomes.
                     
                        Carthus.
                      Fiftly, the name of this Babel is mysterium, in quo aliud cernitur, aliud intelligitur: Quia enim tot simulatis virtutibus decoratur, non omnibus mulieris huius prauatas innotescet, sed viris ius
                           •
                        is & prudentibus. So then by this Babel, some mysticall enemie is vnderstood, being indeede an enemie, but in shew pretending friendship: and therfore called afterward Gog, and not Magog, that is, not an open and plain enemy, as is the Turke: But Gog, a couered enemie: for this cause figured also before by a beast with two hornes, looking

like a Lambe, but speaking like the Dragon. To this purpose sayes IEROME,
                        In Daniel. 11. 
                     Simulabit se ducem faederis: And Hilarius, that Antichrist shall bee contrarie to Christ, vnder a 
                           •
                        orme of fained and hypocriticall godlinesse. And Chrysostome,
                     
                        In Matth. Hom. 49. 
                     Antichrist must bee knowne by his doctrine, not by his titles, miracles, nor words of godlinesse. And therefore it is a silly defence of the Iesuites: The Pope (say they) prayers humbly to God, and calles himselfe seruus seruorum Dei, therefore is not an aduersarie: for the Question is not what he calles hims
                        •
                     lfe, but what hee is. But to hold vpon this point, it is euident by what which I haue said, that by Babel here is not meant Rome Ethnicke, nor yet Rome
                     
which at the last shall rebell (for both these are open enemies) but Rome vnder Popes, a mysticall enemie. Sixthly, in this Reuelation, there are two women described; the one Chap. 12. clothed with the Sunne, which is CHRIST, hauing on her head twelue Starres for a Garland, (the glorie of the true Church is the doctrine of the twelue Apostles) and vnder her feete the Moone, figuring this mutable world: This woman (as themselues confesse) represents the true Church. The other woman described Chap. 17. is arayed in Purple, Scarlet, Gold, and precious stones, voide of inward beautie and chastitie, shee sets forth her selfe with all externall brauerie, that shee may drawe

many louers to her. Now (I say) seeing the first woman signifies the true Church (as themselues confesse) and afterward is called the L

                        mbes wife, why doe they not 
                        •
                     ee that this whorish woman must signifie the false Church? And since they grant that Babel is Rome, what else can the whoore of Babel be, but the whoorish Church of Rome? And therefore their owne Doctours expounding that prophecie of Saint Iohn, Babel is fallen, and become an habitation of di

                  C.
                  No (Sir) the most iudicious, both Ancient, and Recent, expound it to bee a falling from the faith: As for the Ancients see Augustine de Ciuitate Dei

                  R.
                  But granting it were so, yet this Prophecie is of one single man and cannot be meant of the Popes of Rome.
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  No that is also a silly shift: when your Church-men say that the Pope is Christ Vicar, doe they meane any one single Pope?
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  No, but the state or succession of Popes.
               
               
                  C.
                  Very well, and when wee say that the Pope is Christ opposite, doe wee vnderstand this man, or that man? no truly, but the whole state or regiment of them since their defection.
               
               
                  R.
                  But I see not how this Prophecie either toucheth the Pope, or the Church of Rome; and if it bee meant of any defection from the faith, it is meant of Luther, Caluine, and such as haue fallen from the Church of Rome.

Now the Spirit speakes euidently, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, attending to Spirits of errour, and Doctrine of Deuils: and marke how hee subioynes some particular points of their doctrine which shall come in with the Apostasie, to wit, that they shall forbid mariage, and command abstinence from meates, which God hath created to bee receiued with thankesegiuing. VVhat thinke you now, whether doth this touch them or vs?

                  You haue marked that very wel: for the Pope hath made the name of Romanes more famous then the Emperours did, and vnder colour of a spirituall Empire, hath made all churche subiect vnto the Church of Rome, and from his name to bee named Papists.

                  The one is: Where was your Church before Luther? the other: Are all our fathers damned?

                     NOw (Sir) you remember you propoūded two questions to me yesternight.
               
               
                  R.
                  It is very true, and I would gladly heare your answere to

them, for▪ my further resolution: What thinke you then, because you call Papistrie heresie, are you of that minde that all our fathers are damned, & that no Papist can be saued?
               
               
                  C.
                  I am not to iudge of mens persons: many are called Papists who know not what Papistrie meanes, and many liue Papists who dare not die Papists, or if so they doe, they know not what they doe. But Papistrie it selfe, I affirme it is a pernicious doctrine, yea as the Apostle cals it, a doctrine of diuels, killing the Soules of them who beleeue it: But this is the second of your questions, which we will reserue till the next day.
               
               
                  R.
                  Let it be so. What then say you to the first? Where was

your Church before Luther?

                  R.
                  Looke the Churches of Asia, Asricke, and of Europe, consider them as they were before the mysterie of iniquitie came to the hight, and you shal see that they all had the same doctrine, and forme of a Church

that we haue in all substantiall points pertaining to Religion.
               
               
                  R.
                  But you are not able to name one before Luther, teaching in all things as he did.
               
               
                  C.
                  This is a peece of Sophistrie, whereby your deceiuers blind the ignorant.
               
               
                  R.
                  How so, should not the teachers of the truth agree in al things in one harmonie?
               
               
                  C.
                  I grant they should, and thanks be to God, they doe also in al substantial things which are Articles of our faith. But is this a good reason: because some Doctors in some opinions differ, whereof men may bee ignorant and saued neuerthelesse, that therefore these Doctors teach no truth, and their Churches are no true Churches?
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  That seemes to bee hard indeed.

                  R.
                  It is no reason.

                     Cyprian in the point of rebaptising, taught not as Cornelius;

what of that? will it follow that hee was not a faithfull Pastor, or the Church of Carthage was not a true Church?

                  Well, I shall remember that (God willing): but in the dayes of Papistrie, wherewith you say the world was blinded, where was your Church?
               
               
                  C.
                  Answere me but an other question, and it shall resolue you.

                  Your Doctors say, that when Antichrist shall come, the Church shall 
                        •
                     lie to the desert, that is, as themselues expound it: The Church shall bee without publike state of regiment,

                     and open free exercise of holy functions, neither shall it bee unknowne to the

faithfull which follow it; as this day may bee seene the like by the Church of Romane Catholiques in many parts of England.
                  
               
               
                  R.
                  What doth that helpe you?
               
               
                  C.
                  Very much: that which they themselues say, will bee done, wee say is done: Antichrist hath alreadie chased the Church to the wildernesse, and so oppressed it, that for a time it had no publike state of regiment, nor open free exercise of holy functions: yet was it not vnknowne to the faithfull that followed it, nor to the enemies that persecuted it, as this day may bee seene by the Church of Christian Catholikes in many parts of France.

see it is a needlesse question for the Popes Church to demand of vs, where our Church then was? for they found vs alwaies in their teeth before euer Luther or Caluin was borne.

The third cause, for that all other sectes doe bring an horror with the hainousnesse of their blasphemies against God; but this Sect of Leonists hath a great shew of godlinesse, because they liue iustly before men, and beleeue all thinges well concerning God, and all the Articles which are contained in the Creede, onely they blaspheme & hate the Church of Rome.

                  That was sufficiently cleared in our first Conference.
               
               
                  C.
                  It was so, yet you force mee to remember it. But now before I come to the point: I will tell you a prettie Storie I haue read concerning this matter.
               
               
                  R.
                  Let mee heare it I pray you.
               
               
                  C.
                  I read that a certaine Duke of Frisland named Raboldus, about the yeare of our LORD nine hundreth, being perswaded (as hee pretended) to embrace Christianitie, as he went to bee baptized and had the one of his feet in the water, he demanded of the Bishops If all his Forefathers were damned? the Bishops

answered more rashly then wisely, they were all damned: whereupon the Duke pulled backe his feete againe, saying, Then I will also bee damned with them. Thinke you this a good answere?
               
               
                  R.
                  No indeede I thinke it a mad answere.
               
               
                  C.
                  Yet the same is the poyson wherewith your Iesuits subtilly infect the hearts of simple ones, that they should rather choose to be damned with their Fathers th

                     n saued without them.
               
               
                  R.
                  But will you say to vs as these Bishops said to him, That all our Fathers are damned?
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  Nay that wil I not; iudgement of election and reprobation pertaines to the Lord, their

persons I leaue: but the doctrine of Papistrie I am sure is deadly, and bringes damnation to the soules of men.
               
               
                  R.
                  Then you will not giue iudgment of their persons.
               
               
                  C.
                  No indeed: for, as to their persons▪ I know many this day are so called, who know not the Doctrine of Papistrie; and, as to them who haue liued before vs, howsoeuer in their life they professed Papistrie, yet in their death they were forced to seeke comfort in our Religion.
               
               
                  R.
                  That is strange that you will say many of our Fathers died in your Religion.

See you not here first, that they warned their people to prouide for themselues so long as they are in the body, and feede them not with a vaine hope, as the Romish Doctors doe their people: For the present they send them to a place they call Purgatorie, but promise to bring them againe out of it; they first suffering paines there, and either themselues, or their frinds making due payment for them on Earth.
               
               
                  R.
                  In good sooth that is a comfortlesse, and (I may say) a cousning kind of doctrine.

                  Wel, see you not againe a renouncing of all other merites; and of all satisfactions to bee made by suffering the paines of Purgatorie or otherwise. And

thirdly see you not that the Pastor teacheth, and the people professeth a sure confidence, & no dubitation, in Christs bloud onely.

                  In truth that is a very modest answere.
               
               
                  C.
                  But heare you what further he saith: Si quis ex Antecessoribus nostris, vel ignoranter, vel simpliciter non hoc obseruanit, & tenuit quod nos Dominus exemplo suo docuit, potest simplicitatieius de indulgentiâ Domini venia concedi; nobis vero non poterit ignosci,

quia à Domino admoniti & instructi sumus; If any of our forefathers, either of ignorance, or simplicity hath not holden and obserued that which the Lord hath taught vs, to doe by his example, there may bee mercie granted to his simplicity out of Gods indulgence: but we cannot be forgiuen, who now are otherwise instructed & admonished by the Lord.
               
               
                  R.
                  That answer I see is more sharp, and yet most reasonable; many things are excusable in the night, that are not tolerable in the day: The seruant that knows his M

                  C.
                  And I am glad you see it, and I would many more had their eyes open to see it, who

thinke Papistry now tolerable in the dayes of light, as it was in the dayes of darkenesse: it was a fault then, for euen the seruāt who knowes not his Masters will shall be stricken; but it is a double fault now, for hee, who knowes his Masters will, and does the contrary, shall haue double s

                  Indeed I will not, and that for two causes: first, because, (as I haue said) many are Papists by name, which are no Papists: some of ignorance, some of vaine glory, some of policy to get themselues the more credite. And as to these who are

infected indeed with the heresies of Papistrie; yet is it vncertain if they shall so continue, for the Lord is ma

                  And yet whatsoeuer I haue said concerning the persons

of Papists, there is further to bee saide of Papistrie it selfe: that it is a doctrine so full of heresies, so directly contrary to the doctrine of the Gospell, that I dare say, a man beleeuing all the points of Papistrie, and perseuering in them

                  R.
                  Now that is the point, & I pray you make it cleare.
               
               
                  C.
                  It is cleare by these places following, which will shew you that Papistrie is a doctrine of Diuels, a plague of God, and a iust punishment laied on reprobate men for their sinnes, and a forerunner of the wrath to come.
               
               
                  R.
                  Good sooth I quake to heare this.
               
               
                  
                  C.
                  You shall see them al particularly qualified: and first there is a Prophesie made by the Apostle of the defection which was to come, in these words; Now the spirite speakes euidently, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giuing heed to the spirites of error & doctrine of Diuels: which speake lies in hipocrisie, hauing their conscience burned with an hote yron, forbidding to marrie, and commanding to abstaine from meates, &c. Perceiue you not here, that the doctrine which forbids mariage and commands abstinence from meates, is called a doctrine of diuels?
               
               
                  R.
                  Very well, but that is meant of heretikes, which were soone after the Apostles daies,

as Ebio

                  C.
                  Nay, that is a sillie shift, for he saieth, these teachers shal come in the latter times; and the departure from the faith, wherof hee prophesieth, was not to come till the fall of the Roman Empire: but in the daies of Ebion, Marcion, &c. the Roman Empire was in great glorie.
               
               
                  R.
                  But if that bee meant of any Apostasie in the later times it is of your sect (will they say) that hath fallen frō the church of Rome.
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  It cannot be meant of vs: for wee neithe

                      forbid mariage, nor command abstinence from meates for conscience sake.
               
               
                  R.
                  That is verie true: but may not the Church for some causes command abstinencie frō meats?
               
               
                  
                  C.
                  Yes, for Prayer and deuotion, and that for a time onely, but not because any meate is vncleane, or one meat is holier then an other▪ as they thinke their Chartrouse Monkes more holy that neuer eate flesh, then others are:

                  Indeed that seemes to be somewhat superstitious.

                  Well, I will enter into no more particulars concerning this question. It is cleare, these are two points of Papisticall doctrine, called by the Apostle doctrine of Diuels; So I proceede, There shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders, so that if it were possible they should deceiue

any man worshippe the beast, &c. the same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, and shall bee tormented in fire and brimstone. Reu. 14.9.10. Goe out of Babel my people, that yee bee not partakers of her sinnes, and receiue not of her plagues. These places make cleare vnto you, that it is onelie the reprobate, worldly-minded called therefore dwellers on the earth, whose names are not written in the book of life, children of perdition; it is only they (I say) who are fullie and finally deceiued with the spirit of Antichrist, and that in Gods righteous iudgement are giuen ouer to belieue lies, because they receiued not the loue of the truth: What thinke yee of these?
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  In truth I am astonished to heare these fearefull places.
               
               
                  C.
                  This is yet further cleared by Augustine, who expounding that place of the Apostle 2. Thes. 2. Adoccultu
                           ••
                         Dei iudicium pertinet quòd impij ab Antichristo feducuntur: It pertaines to Gods secret iudgement that the wicked are seduced by Antichrist: Seducentur qui seduci merebuntur, pro eo quòd dilectionem veritatis non receperunt. They shall bee deceiued who haue deserued to bee deceiued, because they receiue not the loue of the truth: and yet more feareful is the sentence, which he subioynes, Iudicati seducentur, & seducti iudicabuntur: when they are iudged they shall be deceiued, and because they were deceiued they

shal be iudged ouer againe: they are first iudged by the iudgement of God, secretly iust, and iustly secret, whereby now hee punisheth the sinnes of men, deliuering them to the Spirit of errour, that receiued not the loue of his truth: and because they were deceiued they shall be iudged againe in that last and manifest iudgment to bee made by Christ Iesus, who was vniustly iudge himselfe, but most iustly shall iudge the World. This Commentarie makes it cleare, that Papistrie is not onely a sinne, but a present punishment of God inflicted on man for sinne, specially for contempt of the Gospell; and a procurement of that fearefull wrath that is to come, which if it were

considered, men would not esteeme Papistrie so indifferent a thing as they doe▪

                  God be mercifull to them who yet are blinded with these errours, and Lord make mee thankefull who hath begunne to deliuer mee from that darkenesse; the Lord illuminate mee more and more with his light, that I may know his way, and may receiue grace to follow it.
               
               
                  C.
                  Amen: But now I remember, I promised before to declare vnto you, that Papistrie impugnes both the Person and offices of Christ, and so in effect denies that Iesus the Sonne of Marie is the Christ.
               
               
                  R.

                  C.
                  Because they worshippe and adore a Christ, who is not come in the flesh: To cleare this, I pray you consider that Canon of the Apostles, 1. Ioh. 4. Beloved, beleeue not euery spirit, but trie the spirits if they be of God: because many false Prophets are gone out into the World. In this the spirit of God is knowne; Euerie

spirit that confesseth Iesus Christ to haue come in the flesh is of God. There is a golden rule for vs and them both, and marke there the opposition, Euerie spirit that saith otherwise, is the spirit of Antichrist.

                  C.
                  Yea, it is against them directly, for the word teacheth vs to worship Christ, Conceiued of the holy Ghost, horne of the Virgine Marie: But they worshippe Christ created by a Priest, not conceiued by the holy Ghost; a Christ whose fleshe is made of Breade by Transubstantiation, whereby they destroy the Article of his Incarnation.

                  If it bee the same Christ, then must they grant that his flesh is not created of bread: for that Christ borne of the Virgin Marie was made flesh of the seed of Dauid by the operation of the Holy Ghost, but this Christ whom they worship in the Masse hath his flesh made of bread by Transubstantiation, and they are not ashamed to call their Priest for this worke Creatorem sui Creatoris, a Creatour of his Creatour.
               
               
                  R.
                  But saith not our Lord that the Bread giuen in the Sacrament is his Bodie?
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  Yea indeede, and so wee beleeue it is: for it is no naked nor common bread that hoe giues vs there the giuing of that bread, It is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the

Communion of his blessed bodie.
               
               
                  R.
                  But if it bee Bread, how can it be his body?
               
               
                  C.
                  It is needlesse to demaund how? Since he hath said it; but I beleeue it is his body.
               
               
                  R.
                  But may not Christ of his omnipotent power transubstantiate bread into his body?
               
               
                  C.
                  And I pray you, may not Christ of his omnipotent power, and truth, giue mee his body, except hee turne bread into his bodie?
               
               
                  R.
                  I dare not say so.
               
               
                  C.
                  And you haue reason: The Papists charge vs that wee denie Gods omnipotencie, but the fault is theirs; they denie his omnipotencie, when they say hee can not giue vs his body

in the Sacrament, except hee make his body of bread. Doe they not here limit the Lord?
               
               
                  R.
                  Well I see it is great wisedome to ponder euery thing we beleeue in the ballance of Gods word, I wold not haue thought there had beene suc

                     lasphemie against the person of Christ in that Doctrin of Transubstantiation as now I see that Canon of the Apostle declares plainly.
               
               
                  C.
                  You may ioyne to this another testimonie of the Apostle Hebrewes 13. Iesus Christ yesterday, this day, and the same for euer.
                  
               
               
                  R.
                  What will that make against them?
               
               
                  C.
                  That they are blinde to worship a Christ this daie, who was not a Christ yesterday: for

you know they grant themselues that before consecration the bread is not Christ.
               
               
                  R.
                  It is true indeed.
               
               
                  C.
                  Then you may perceiue it is but an artificiall Christ made by man whom they worshippe, and not 
                        •
                     he true Christ. Thus you see how they are iniurious to his person, for the which cause I said to you, that Papists by necessitie of consequence, denie Iesus the sonne of Marie to bee the Christ. Now to his Offices, they are all comprised vnder the name Christ, for he is the anoynted King, Prophet, and Priest of his Church.
               
               
                  R.
                  And they will grant all that vnto you.
               
               
                  C.
                  I know in word they will, but in effect they take his Offices

from him?
               
               
                  R.
                  How can that be?
               
               
                  C.
                  You shall see how: what thinke you is the office of a Prophet?
               
               
                  R.
                  To teach.
               
               
                  C.
                  You say verie well, and for this cause Christ is called the great Prophet raised vp among his brethren: And the great Angell of the counsell of God, who came into the World to reueile perfectly vnto the Church the will of God concerning mans saluation, and Gods worship: so that now once for all God hath spoken to vs in these last dayes by his sonne, and we haue not to expect from any other any further declaration of his will.
               
               
                  R.
                  I thinke no man wil denie that.
               
               
                  
                  C.
                  You shall heare how it is denied, if first I make the point more clear vnto you: you know that the father proclaimed from Heauen, first at Iordan, then at mount Tabor, This is my welbeloued sonne in whom I am well pleased, heare him. See you not here how we are plainly commaunded to learne Gods will concerning our Saluation from the Sonne?
               
               
                  R.
                  Yea I see that, and it is good reason.
               
               
                  C.
                  Then if you will come and heare what the Son saies, you shal see that as the Father sends vs to the Sonne, so the Sonne sends vs to the Scriptures: if we would haue eternall life search the Scriptures, and he witnesseth plainely Iohn 17.8. The wordes

which thou gauest mee, I gaue them, meaning to his Disciples. Where againe if you looke to the Disciples words: The Scripture (sayes Saint Paul) is able to make the man of God perfect, and therefore hee protests Act. 20 that he taught nothing but Moses and the Prophets, and yet that hee had deliuered to them the whole counsell of God. See you what a comfortable harmonie is here: The Father bids vs heare the Sonne; the Sonne protests the wordes the Father gaue him, hee gaue to his Disciples; and both of them sends vs to the Scripture, as conteining the whole counsell of God concerning our Saluation.
               
               
                  R.
                  I see all that clearly.
               
               
                  C.
                  Then what spirit are they

led with that dare say, It had beene good for the Church the Scripture had neuer beene.
                  
               
               
                  R.
                  Who dare say that?
               
               
                  C.
                  I haue heard with mine eares defenders of Papistrie say it: and the positions of their owne Doctors no lesse blasphemous are extant to bee seene: Lectio Scripturae non, 
                           •
                        antùm est invtilis, sed pernitio samultis modis; the reading of Holy Scripture is not only vnprofitable; but pernicious. And therefore they wil not let the people read nor serch the Scripture, though Christ commanded: so to do
                        •
                     : and instoade of Scripture they intrude on the Church their owne decrees, and other traditions, which they make of equal authoritie with the Scripture.

Thus you see how they take away Christs Propheticall office. Now to come to his Priestly office: you know the Priests office was twofold, first hee ought to sacrifice for the people, & next to pray for them.
               
               
                  R.
                  And they acknowledge both these, that Christ hath offered himselfe in a propitiatory sacrifice for our sinnes, and that hee still makes intercession for v

                  C.
                  I, but they so acknowledge it, that in both these offices they ioyne others with Christ, and so make him not a full and perfect Sauiour of his people by himselfe, but a halfe-Sauiour in part.
               
               
                  R.
                  I vnterstand not that.

                  They will not be against that.
               
               
                  C.
                  But they are when they make this distinction, that principally Christs bloud clenseth from sinne▪ but secondarily there must be other things with it to clens

                      sinne: as works of satisfaction in this life, and fire of Purgatorie in the life to come. By these also according to their own

                  R.
                  In truth this one place makes all their doctrine, concerning the supplement of Christs merits, iustly to be suspected: for since he hath made the purgation of our sinnes by himselfe, what should we looke that they are to bee purged by any other?
               
               
                  C.
                  You reason well.
               
               
                  R.
                  I speake as I think: it is either pittiful ignorāce, that they see not the truth, or their wilful malice that they dare mutilate so cleare a place of holy Scripture, leauing it out of their Bible, because it 
                        •

                  C.
                  But now take in with this

the other testimony of holy Scripture, whereof I spake. you haue it Heb. 7. ver. 25. Christ is able to saue perfectly (
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ) all that come vnto God by him.
                  
               
               
                  R.
                  I see that is also a comfortable place.
               
               
                  C.
                  So it is indeed: for as the first makes you see that Christs meriting power is personall, & in himselfe, not transf
                        •
                     rred to any other▪ so this makes you see it is perfect: hee hath done the worke of our saluation in his owne person, and hee hath done it perfectly: What more can you craue?
               
               
                  R.
                  Truly I craue no more.
               
               
                  C.
                  Away then with these rotten dregges of Papistrie, that teach vs to depend vpon other merites, & vpon an other bloud

(as I shewed you the first day) besides the merits of the bloud of Christ.
               
               
                  R.
                  For my own part I think neuer to leane to them, but will rest vpon that onely perfect sacrifice of Christ offered on the Crosse for my sinnes.
               
               
                  C.
                  If you abide there, you are vpon the sure foundation; and remember you must renounce all other sacrifices, which derogate from the perfection & sufficiency of that one sacrifice of Christ.
               
               
                  R.
                  I will indeed▪
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  Then for your confirmation marke these places. Christ in the end of the world hath appeared once to put away sinne by the sacrif
                           ••
                        e of himselfe. Heb. 9.26. Christ was once offered to take

away the sins of many, Heb. 9.28. Wee are sanctified by the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once, Heb. 10.10. This man after he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes, sits foreuer at the right hand of God. Heb. 10.12. With one offering hath he 
                           •
                        onsecrated for euer them that are sanctified. Heb. 10.14. where remission of sinnes is, there is no more offering for sin, Heb. 10.18. Christ needed not daily (as these high Priests) to offer vp sacrifice, first for his owne sinnes, and then for the peoples: for that did hee once, when he offered vp himselfe, Heb. 7.27. without shedding of blood, is no remission. Heb. 9.22. Perceiue you not here that the Apostle repeating this so oft, that Christ was once offered, for taking away our sinnes, destroyeth all other pretended

sacrifices for sinne, and specially that sacrifice of the Masse, which they say is a propitiatorie sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead.
               
               
                  R.
                  Truely the places are so plaine, that very children may vnderstand them, and I would God that these poore people, who of a blind mind dote after Masses, thinking by it to gette the pardon of their sinnes, had this benefite of Gods word, as you haue it, that so by the light of it they might come to the knowledge of the truth.
               
               
                  C.
                  And I wish the same from my heart, But now to confirm you yet further, I pray you mark how blasphemous and deceitfull a thing their Masse is. First, is not this a mockerie of GOD

the Father, To desire him to accept his owne Sonne: Is Christ out of the fauour of his Father? said he not; He is my Son in whom I am well pleased? shall a mortal & miserable sinful Priest be a Mediatour, or Peacemaker betweene the Father and the Sonne, praying the Father that he would accept his Sonne, and send downe an Angell to take vp his bodie into Heauen?
               
               
                  R.
                  Fie vpon it: It is a vile blasphemie.
               
               
                  C.
                  Secondly, see you not how it inverts Gods ordinance? for where hee hath ordained a Sacrament, wherein God offers and giues his Sonne to vs; they haue changed it into a sacrifice, wherein they offer vp the Son to the Father.
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  I see that also▪
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  Thirdly, Is it not an iniurious thing to Christ, to say that any can offer him vp to God, but himselfe?
               
               
                  R.
                  It is inde
                        •
                     de: for as no other Sacrifice can satisfie Gods iustice, so no other sacrificer can bee worthie to offer him but himselfe, as is cleare out of your former Testimonies:
               
               
                  C.
                  Fourthly, Is it not a deceiuing of the people, to say that an vnbloudie Sacrifice (such as they say the Masse is) can bee propitiatorie to obtaine remission of sinnes?
               
               
                  R.
                  It is indeed, and expresly against the Word of God you haue alledged, Without shedding of bloud there is no remission: they grant themselues that in the

Masse there is no shedding of bloud, and how then can it giue pardon or remission of sinnes?
               
               
                  C.
                  Well then, since by this you see how they derogate frō Christs sacrifice, which is the first part of Christes priestly office, I will now let you see how they also cut away the other, namely, his intercession. Marke that place of the Apostle, There is one God, and one Mediator of God and Man, the Man Christ Iesus.
                  
               
               
                  R.
                  They haue a distinction for that, and say, there is but one Mediator of redemption, but for Intercession many.
               
               
                  C.
                  But will you consider the place; and you shall see where the Apostle sayes, there is but one Mediator, he is speaking of

                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
Intercession and praying, and so his meaning must be, There is one Mediator of Intercession: read the place and see.
               
               
                  R.
                  I see it is so indeed.
               
               
                  C.
                  Now with it wil you but ioyne this place of Augustine, Qui pro omnibus interpellat pro quo autem nullus,
                     
                        Cont. Epist. Parme
                              •
                           . l. 2. cap. 8, 
                     is verus & vnicus mediator est: He that interceeds for al, for whom none interceedes, is the onely true Mediator. And there hee sayes it should bee a great absurdity, if Paul were called a Mediator, for so there should be many Mediators of Intercession.
               
               
                  R.
                  But should not Christians interceede one of them for an other, as wee are commanded, One of you pray for an other.
                  
               
               
                  
                  C.
                  They should indeed: but you must vnderstand, that this and the like precepts are for Christians here militant on earth in one communion, wherin alike one of them is bound to helpe an other by their praiers.
               
               
                  R.
                  But do not they who are in heauen pray for the Church militant on earth?
               
               
                  C.
                  I thinke they doe in general, but not vpon any particular knowledge of our priuat necessities, troubles or tentations.
               
               
                  R.
                  How can that be?
               
               
                  C.
                  You may soon vnderstand how, for if they know your griefes, it is either by hearing of your words, or vnderstanding of your thoughts, or by some Reuelation made to them. Thinke yee they know your thoghts.
               
               
                  
                  R.
                  No indeed, that is proper to God.
               
               
                  C.
                  Think you they hear your voice, when you expresse in prayer your thoughts by your words.
               
               
                  R.
                  I cannot thinke that neither, since they want their bodies which haue the organs of hearing.
               
               
                  C.
                  Then they must know it by Reuelation.
               
               
                  R.
                  It is most likely that when wee pray, God tels them our necessities.
               
               
                  C.
                  What neede you then to pray them to interceede for you.
               
               
                  R.
                  But how shall wee goe to a King but by his Courtiers?
               
               
                  C.
                  What a silly refuge is that? You haue forgotten what you

answered euen now. See you not here how that similitude vsed by Papists is destroied, to wit, That as wee goe to earthly Kings by Courtiers, so we shold goe to the King of Heauen, by heauenly Courtiers: for here it is not the Courtier that shewes our necessities to the King, but the King you see shewes them to his Courtiers. And would you not think him a foole, who may haue the King himselfe to speake to, and knowes hee will be welcome if he speake as hee should, and yet passeth by the King, and depends vpon Courtiers to haue his turne done by them?
               
               
                  R.
                  I thinke no lesse then you say, but how is it then they pray for vs in generall?
               
               
                  
                  C.
                  I will shew you how: there are foure sorts of prayer, one called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     , thanksgiuing ascribed to them, and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , too in generall, whereby they pray for some good they yet want, but look to enioy: as is euident out of their owne words, How long Lord: for this is the voice of these who want some thing they would faine haue.
               
               
                  R.
                  Tell me I pray you what want they who are in heauen?
               
               
                  C.
                  First, these glorified spirits want their bodies, without the which they can neuer haue full contentment: for the soule and body were created companions, the perfection of both stands in the promised vnion of both.
               
               
                  R.
                  I vnderstand that very

well: but want they no other thing, for which they cry, How long?
                  
               
               
                  C.
                  Yea, they want their brethren, all them that belong to the communion of Saints; their desire shall not be satisfied till all their brethren bee where they are: for God hath so prouided that th
                           •
                        y without vs should not bee perfected.
                  
               
               
                  R.
                  In truth that is exceeding comfortable, that Adam, Abraham, & the rest of that congregation of the first borne shal not be perfected till we come to them, yea, til the full number of Gods Saints bee accomplished. But is there no other thing they long for?
               
               
                  C.
                  Yea, they long and pray for the comming of Christ, Euen

so come Lord Iesus: at which time they know verie well, that all the promises of God shall bee performed to all and euerie one of the Saints of God. Thus farre you see how they in Heauen do pray in generall.
               
               
                  R.
                  But you thinke not that we should praie to them in our particular necessities.
               
               
                  C.
                  No indeed▪ for beside the former reason, we haue no warrant to praie vnto them, and so cannot doe it in faith. Will you consider can there bee any better Schoolemasters to teach vs how to pray then the persons of the blessed Trinitie? and thinke you not we are surest when wee prai
                        •
                      in such a manner as they haue taught?
               
               
                  R.
                  That cannot bee denied.
               
               
                  
                  C.
                  Then I pray you marke it, there is the voice of God the Father,
                        Psal. 50.15. 
                     Call vpon me; there is the precept of God the Son, When you pray you shall say in this manner, Our Father which art in Heauen &c. there is againe the voice of God the Holy Ghost, who when hee teacheth vs to pray, teacheth vs,

What say you to these, is there any word here of praier to Cherubin, or Seraphin? is there any warrant for turning ouer of all the prayers in the Psalme booke to the Virgin Marie? O Ladie that art my righteousnesse. Psal. 4. O Ladie reprooue mee not in thy wrath. Psal. 6.

and safest way to pray to God by the mediation of Christ.

                  But now I will bring you one cleare instance, to let you see how Papistrie takes away Christs intercession, and sets him idle in the Heauens.

                  What is that?
               
               
                  C.
                  They say there is in Heauen, a King, God the Father; & a Queene the Virgin Marie; and that the King hath giuen to the Queen dimidium regni,

her Sonne Christ Iesus.
               
               
                  R.
                  Good sooth these are too grosse speeches, for as you haue said, they make Christ idle in Heauen, or like a childe vnder Tuition: for my owne part I will keepe that reuerent estimation of the blessed Virgin, that is due to her: but will euer reserue to Christ the glorie of a Sauiour and Mediatour.
               
               
                  C.
                  Let it bee so, only now I will let you see that as Papistrie destroies many Articles of our Christian faith, concerning the person, and Offices of Christ: So it is a P

                  R.
                  That is strange: for there are many flourishing Kingdomes

with vnitie and peace that professe Papistrie.
               
               
                  R.
                  Remember you what our Sauiour sayes in the Parable. So long as the strong man keepes his house all is in quiet, but when a stronger then hee comes in to bind him, there begins the battell: So long as Sathan possessed the World by the darknesse of Papistrie, there was a miserable felicitie in it, and a cursed vnitie, such as was in Sodom, where young and old from the foure corners of the Citie conspired and agreed to one impietie: But now since Christ comes in by his glorious Gospell to illuminate his owne with the light thereof, that which before seemed peace in Papistrie, now appeares to bee

                  I pray you consider what a Polici
                        •
                      of Sathan that is to disgrace the Gospell: how manie Heresies arose in the Apostles dayes or soone after, that was not in the World before. Then came vp Simon Magus, Cerinthus, Ebion, Marcion, Basilides, Menander, Valentinus, Cerdon, Marcion, and many more. Shall the Gospell be blamed for this? or rather may you not see

it is the craft of the Deuill to disgrace the Gospell?
               
               
                  R.
                  Indeede I thinke it no good reason that the Gospell should be the lesse esteemed of. There is but one truth, but manifold errours; and I remember our Sauiour warning vs of thi
                        •
                      in that Parable of the Gospell; That where the good Husbanman sowes good wheat in the day, incontinent comes the Enemie that euill one, and sowes his popple in the night.
               
               
                  C.
                  Now if you apply that to our present question, the doubt is easily solued: So long as the World was blinded with idolatrie and the Masse (which in effect is but a Masse of Heresies) Sathan laie quiet, hee was not troubled in his Kingdome, and

hee raised no trouble in the World: but since the light of the Gospell discouered his darkenesse, and that hee findes his Kingdome decaying, and himselfe falling by the preaching of the Gospell, now he bestirres himselfe more busily, and doth what he can to disgrace this glorious Evāgell by vile heresies of some that impugne it, and profane liues of others who professe it. But as you see, it is no reason why the Gospell should be blamed for any of these.
               
               
                  R.
                  It is not indeed. But now you remember you beganne to discourse how Papistrie is a Pest of Common-wealthes, Kingdoms, dissoluing all the bands of humane fellowshippe, and societie among men.

                  It is true indeed, for if a man wil goe to a Papists church to heare Masse, he shall not discerne what the Priest sayes, vnlesse he vuderstand Latine, and I haue many times thought strange of it.

what he craued; and iustly is the like, Yea a worse plague, in so much as it is Spirituall powred out vpon new Babel, for her intollerable presumption, that when their Priest speakes the people wots not what he sayes.
