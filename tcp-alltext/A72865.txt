            Beſides ſuch ſweet triumphant mirth
            did from the Citty ſound,
            That I therewith was rauiſhed,
            my ioy did ſo abound.
            With muſicke, mirth, and melody,
            Princes did there imbrace:
            And in my heart I long to be
            within that ioyfull place.
            The more I gaz'd, the more I might,
            the ſight pleaſ'd me ſo well:
            For what I ſaw in euery thing,
            my tongue can no way tell:
            Then of the man I did demand,
            what place the ſame might be:
            Whereas ſo many Kings doe dwell,
            in ioy and melody?
            Quoth he, that bleſſed place is heauen,
            where yet thou muſt not reſt,
            And thoſe that do like Princes walke,
            are men whom God hath bleſt.
            Then did I turne me round about,
            and on the other ſide,
            He bade me view and marke as much,
            what things are to be ſpide.
            With that I ſaw a coale blacke den,
            all tand with ſoot and ſmoake
            Where ſtinking brimſtone burning was,
            which made me like to choake.

               ly creature there I ſaw,
            whoſe face with kniues was flaſht,
            And in a Caldron of poyſon'd filth,
            his vgly corps was waſht
            About his necke were fiery ruffes,
            that flam'd on euery ſide.
            I askt, and loe, the young-man ſaid,
            that he was damn'd for pride.
            Another ſort then did I ſee,
            whoſe bowel
                  •
                Vipers tore:
            And grieuouſly with gaping mouth,
            they did both yell and roare.
            A ſpotted perſon by each one
            ſtood gnawing on their hearts:
            And this was conſcience I was told,
            that plagu'd their enuious parts.
            Theſe were no ſooner out of ſight,
            but ſtraight came in their place,
            A ſort ſtill throwing burning fire,
            which fell againſt their face.
            And ladies full of melted gold,
            were powred downe their throats:
            And theſe were ſet (as ſéem'd to me)
            in midſt of burning boats:
            The formoſt of the company,
            was Iudas I was told,
            Who had for filthy lucre ſake,
            his Lord and Maſter ſold.
            For couetouſnes thoſe were condemn'd
            ſo it was told to me,
            And then, me thought another 
                  •
               ont
            of Hell-hounds I did ſée:
            Their faces they ſeem'd fat in ſight,
            yet all their bones were bare,
            And diſhes full of crawling toads,
            was made their fineſt fare.
            From armes, from hands, from thighes & féet,
            with red hot pincers then,
            The fleſh was pluckt euen frō the bone
            of theſe vile gluttonous men.
            On coale blacke beds, another ſort,
            in grieuous ſort did lie,
            And vnderneath them burning brands;
            their fleſh did burne and fry.
            With brimſtone fierce their Pillows,
            whereon their heads were laid,
            And fiends with whips of glowing fire eke,
            their lecherous ſkins off flaid.
            Then did I ſee another come,
            ſtebb'd in with daggers thicke:
            And filthy fien
                  •
               s with fiery darts,
            their hearts did wound and pricke:
            And mighty bowls of corrupt blood,
            were brought them for to drinke,
            & theſe men were for murther plagu'd,
            from which they could not ſhrinke.
            I ſaw when theſe were gone away,
            the Swearer and the Lyer,
            & theſe were hung vp by the tongues,
            right ouer a flaming fire.
            From eyes, from eares, from nauill, & noſe;
            and from the lower parts,
            The blood, me thought, did guſhing run
            and clodded like mens hearts,
            I asked why that puniſhment,
            was vpon Swearers laid:
            Becauſe qd. one, wounds, blood & hearte
            was ſtill the oath they made.
            And therewithall from vgly Hell,
            ſuch ſhriekes and cryes I heard,
            As though ſome greater griefe and plague
            had vext them afterward.
            So that my ſoule was ſore afraid,
            ſuch terrour on me fell:
            Away then went the yong-man quite,
            and bade me not farewell.
            Wherefore vnto my body ſtraight,
            my fpirit return'd againe,
            And liuely blood did afterward
            ſtretch forth in euery veine.
            My cloſed eyes I opened,
            and raiſed from my ſound:
            And wondred much to ſée my ſelfe
            laid ſo vpon the ground.
            Which when my neighbors did behold,
            great feare vpon them fell.
            To whom ſoone after I did ſhow,
            the newes from Heauen and Hell.
