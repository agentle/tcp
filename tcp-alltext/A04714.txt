               Mary loke betyme, leest per aduenture thou hast not broughte the ryght keye. For this dore is not opened with ye same keye, wherwith thou doest open thy treasoury. And therfore, why hast thou not brought hyther bothe twayne? For surely this is a keye of power / not of connynge.
            
            
               Iul.
               Forsothe I had neuer other but this / neyther I se not what nedeth the other key, whā this is present.

               This freateth me not a lytell. I wyl breke dowue the gates. Hey, hey, some of you, quyckely come open the gate. What a rekenynge is this? Wyl no man come forthe? What causeth this porter to tary so longe? I thynke he is fallen in to some dronken slepe.

               It is happy that we haue so stronge a gate, or elles he wolde haue broken it. He muste nedes be some gyaunt / or some great ruffler / or beater downe of walled townes. But, o, īmortall god / what a synke I smell here?

And ferthermore, it nede not to speake how thou doest ryfte / and smellest al togyther of excesse and dronkennes / and me thynketh thou lokest as thou had of late vomyted. To be shorte, suche is the shape of all thy body / that thou apperest not so broken, roten, and ouercome so moche with age, as with surfettes.

But I speake these thynges to the in vayne, whiche euery audytor dothe not well perceyue. I haue nowe rehersed the howe I crepte vp to myne offyce. Nowe in myn offyce I handled my selfe ī suche wyse, that there is neuer one amonge all the olde bysshoppes, whiche in respect of me appereth worthy the name of bysshops / neither there is any of ye newe byshops to whom ye chyrche, yea Christ himselfe is so moche bounde as to me.

               For truely I (with many newe foūde offyces, as they call thē) haue highly encreased and enlarged the popes treasory. I found (than after) meanes how bysshopryches myght be bought without Simonye: For it was decreed by my predecessoures, that he whiche chaūced to haue a bysshopryche, sholde depose or laye downe his offyce: Which wordes I dyd interprete in this wyse. Thou arte cōmaunded to gyue vp thyne offyce: but that is not gyuen vp whiche thou haste not: thou must bye therfore that offyce whiche thou mayste gyue vp. By this policye euery bysshopryche was worthe to me syxe or seuen thousande duckates / besyd all suche exactions as ben asked customably for bulles. Moreouer, I gate great vauntage of ye newe money, wherwt I fylled al Ytaly: Neyther I ceased at any tyme from gatherynge ryches, perceyuynge ryght well (wtout that) yt neither holy nor prophane domynion coude haue ben ryghtly done wtout that. But and to speke of greater poyntes of my practise, I restored and deliuered vp Bonony than in habyte with ye bentiuoles. To y• see of Rome I ouerthrwe in batayle y• Ueniciens, neuer vaynquesshed before I had almoost take in a snare ye duke Ferrare, longe vexed with batayle. The scysmatyke councell I deluded in good tyme / feynynge an other councell / and so put away one myschief (as the cōmon saying is) with an other. Last of all I droue the frenche men (than sore adred of all chrystendome) clene forthe of ytaly / & was purposed lykewyse to do the Spanyardes

(for I dyd holly so entende) yf the fatall sentēce of god had not taken me out of this lyfe / But se here, how coragious a stomake I shewed. I began to vewe dylygently the borders of hye Fraunce. I let than growe my whyte berde, whan all thyng was in despyracyon. But full sodeynely cōmeth a golden messenger shewynge that at Rauenna a certayne thousandes of Frenche men were slayne. At suche tydynges / Iulius reuyued agayn. Moreouer I lay thre dayes for deed. Also I felte no lyfe at all my selfe, but here (bothe aboue al other mens hope, and myne also) I reuyued agayne. So great is my auctoryte and power, wt my other polycy, that there is at this daye neuer a chrysten prynce, but I can cause hym to make warre / notwithstandynge they be neuer so sure inleged. For an exāple, I brake the last bande and leyge (Whiche the cameryckes made betwene my holynes, and other princes. That is to say ye frēche kynge, & the kyng of Romayns) so craftely, as thoughe there had neuer ben mencyon of it. ¶Besyde all this I kepte so great an hoost / garnysshed so many gloryous and shynynge tryumphes / so many ioly maskeryes / so dyuers buyldīges / and yet I lefte .l.C.M. ducates at the tyme of my deth / intendyng to proue hyer maistryes, if that iewe my phisicyon (that by his sorcery dyd proroge my lyfe) coude haue prolonged me any more. But wolde god nowe some magyke coude restore me to lyfe, that I myght yet finyshe suche thynges, as I dyd gorgyously begynne. Albeit at the poynte of dethe I was

moost besy to prouyde, that batayles whiche I had graciously begon in al partes sholde not cease by my dethe. And I laboured that the treasour whiche I lefte myght be saued for ye same purpose, this was my last wordes at my departynge. Now disdeynest thou to open Christes gates, to a bysshop deseruyng so moche, bothe of Chryst, and his chyrche. He shall more maruel at these thynges that perpendeth and consydereth by what wysoome & pollicy I brought all these maters to passe, hauynge no other helpe at all, as other be cōmenly wonte, nor of my kyn. For I knewe neuer my father, whiche thynge I say to my prayse / nor by beautie, for euery man abhorred my vgly face / neither by any lernyng, whiche I neuer tasted / nor by bodyly strengthe, whiche chaunced me in lyke maner, as I haue descrybed befo

Nor with any clemency or gentilnes, which beinge so harde herted, yt I wolde often be so cruell agaynst some, to whome all other were wonte to be entreated by.

Neyther I had receyued yet ye holy goost. And notwithstandynge at that tyme I was cōmaunded to put it vp agayne / and monysshed openly, that suche maner of fyghtynge, was not syttynge for preestes, neyther for any christen man.

               Yes surely / for I thynke it the hyest kynde of loue to auaunce and magnifie my countre. Therfore I wryte this tytle in all my coynes of money / pictures in all vautes, and walles.

               I speake of certayne townes that belonge to ye see of Rome. For so it pleased the moost holy fathers to call a ꝑticuler parte of theyr possessyons.
            
            
               Pe.
               Truely ye haue gotē moche lucre and auantage to my greate sclaundre. And doest yu therfore call this an intollerable hurte?
            
            
               Iul.
               What elles?

               Ye but was theyr maners to be suffred? or theyr loue towarde god decayed?
            
            
               Iul.
               Tusshe, thou speakest of tryfles / the mater is this. They wthelde from vs yerely infinyte thousādes of duccates, whiche had ben suffycient to fynde an armyryall.
            
            
               Pet.
               Be my trouth a great losse to suche an vsurer. But that same duke of Ferrare, what had he done?
            
            
               Iul.
               What had he done? A chorle of al chorles: whom Alexandre the vicare of Chryste had in 
                     •
                  uche fauoure (thoughe he was but of base bloode) that he maryed one of his doughters to him / & gaue therto great possessyons, for her dowry. And yet nothynge at all remēbryng his humanyte & kyndnesse euer barked and whyned agaynst me / callynge me often scismatyke / 
                     ••
                  ggerer / & frantyke felowe. And farthermore, he claymed many trybutes / which albeit they were but small / yet a dilygēt curate wolde not vtterly dispyse them.
            
            
               Gen.
               Nay, a crafty marchaunt.
            
            
               Iul.
               But to come to our mater / it was somwhat expedyent to that whiche I wente aboute, to

haue that goodly towne coupled to our patrymony / bycause it lay cōmodyously for vs, therfore I was purposed (that ones brought to passe) to gyue it to a kynsman of ours / a felowe very actyue, and bolde inough to attēpte any maner of thing, for ye auaūcement of the chyrche, / which slewe not longe ago the cardinal of Papia wt his owne hāde, for my pleasure but as for his doughters husbande is cōtented wel ynough.

               What here I? Hath also the hye bysshops wyues, & chyldren?
            
            
               Iul.
               They haue no wyues of theyr owne, but what straunge thynge is it for them to haue chyldren / sith they be men as other be, and no geldynges?
            
            
               Pet.
               But tel me what caused that scismatyke counsel.
            
            
               Iul.
               It were very tedious to recyte all from the fyrste begynnynge, therfore I shall touche the affecte as briefly as I can.
               ¶Certayne ꝑsons began to waxe wery of ye courte of Rome, they reported, yt al togyther was corrupte wt fylthy lucre. With prodigyous, and abhominable lechery. With preuy poysonyngꝭ / sacrilege / murdre / symony / and other vnlaufull marchaundyse. They sayde also, that euen I my selfe was a symoniake / a dronkerde / a buggerer / puffed vp with a worldly spiryte. And all to gyther suche a one, that hath vnthryftely occupyed ye rowme / and to the great confusyon of all the christianyte. And so these maters out of frame must be (in gods name) redressed, by a generall counsell. They sayde therto, yt I was sworne to sōmonde a generall counsell wtin two yeres after I toke my honour / and yt vpon this condicyon I was

made pope.
            
            
               Pe.
               But was it truely sayde?
            
            
               Iul.
               Yea, it was trouth in dede. Neuertheles I losed my selfe from yt othe / whan I thought moost expedient. For what is he that wyll doubte any thynge to swere a mayne, to come to suche a botye? Godlynes may be reuerēced otherwyse / as one Iulius / suche an other as I am / was wonte to saye moost elegantly. But marke the boldenes of these loselles: and se to what poynte the mater came. Nyne cardynalles shronke from me at ones. They shewed me they wolde haue a counsell, & cyted me to be there / & prayed me to syt as resident or iudge. Whan they coude not brȳge me to the poynte / they sent out a general cōmaundemēt euery where, by ye auctoryte of Maxymilian the emperour / & also by the auctoryte of Lewes the frenche kynge, the .xij. of that name, 
                     •
                  ycause the hystoriens wytneseth, yt in tymes past che counsel was wonte to be sōmoned by the emperours of Rome. I quake in speakinge it / howe greatly they indeuore them to cut asondre ye cote of Christ wtout any seame / which his crucifyers lefte hole.
            
            
               Pet.
               But was thou suche a felowe as they reported the?
            
            
               Iul.
               What mater is it, if I were? I was ye hye bysshop. But I put case I were more tyrannous than ye Cercopyans / more folysshe than Morichus / or most asse in the worlde / yea more fylthy than a cōmen synke / who soeuer kepeth this key of power, it is mete he be had in reuerence, as Christꝭ vicare, & to worshyp hym as moost holy father in god.
            
            
               Pet.
               Ye, thoughe he be an open mysdoer?
            
            
               Iul.
               That forceth not. But to be playne, it

is not conuenient, that he whiche is in gods stede in erth / & represēteth al hol
                     •
                  ly as it were a god amōge men, sholde be rebuked, or euyll spoken by of euery vyle felowe.
            
            
               Pe.
               But ye cōmen reason cryeth against this, that we sholde iudge wel of hym whom we se do openly euyll, or say well of suche as we perceyue to be nought.
            
            
               Iul.
               I am content, euery man thynke what he lyst, so he say well, or els holde theyr peas, For truely the bysshop of rome may not be rebuked, no not of a generall counsell.

               Iul.
               That reason is nought worth For yf the bysshop of Rome myght be put downe, it must be done by the auctoryte of a generall counsell. yea, & besyde this, a counsel can not be holden wtout the popes consent / for els it is but a conuētycle, & no counsell. But yf so be it be gathered in most due maner, yet nothynge at all may be ordeyned & decreed, but yf ye pope be wyllynge therto. Therfore ye nexte way I knowe to surpresse a pope is an absolute power, wherby (yf it sholde be tryed) one bysshop is able to do more than all the hole counsell. Therfore it is euydent, yt he may not be depriued his patrimony for any maner offence.
            
            
               Pe.
               No? not for murdre.

               No if he killed his fader.

               Neither for wicked symony.
            
            
               Iul.
               No not for .vi.C. symonyes.
            
            
               Pet.
               Not for poysonynge.
            
            
               Iul.
               No, nor for no sacrylege neither.
            
            
               Pe.
               Nor for blasphemynge agaynst god?

               Iul.
               It forceth not. For put therto (yf yu wylte) .vi.C. mo, and worse yf thou can feyne them, & ioyne them all togyther / yet maye not the hye bysshop of Rome be put out of his place, for them all.
            
            
               Pe.
               Thou tellest me of a dignyte which I neuer herde of before / if he only may be as noughty as he lyst, & no man correct hym. And also a more newe vnhappy case of ye chyrche, if it may in no wise dryue out so abhomynable a monstre / but be cōstreyned

to worshyp and kepe suche a byshop, as no man wold suffre to kepe his horses.
            
            
               Iul.
               Some say that he may be put out for one thing alone.
            
            
               Pe.
               For what goodnes is that? For as for noughtynes, it can not, yf these thingꝭ before rehersed can be no causes.
            
            
               Iul
               For heresy / and yet must he be openly conuycte. But that is but a fable / and hurteth hym not a poynte / and this is the reason. ¶For fyrst of all, he may at his pleasure abrogate the lawe, if he lyke it not. And agayne / who dare accuse his hyghnesse of heresye? namely, beynge so stronge in power, and hauyng so moche ayde. Moreouer, if it chaūce hym to be thyrst downe by the counsel, yet hath he a good remedy, as to reuoke his heresy, if yt he may in no wyse deny it. To make shorte, there be a thousāde stertinge holes for to escape out easyly at them, wtout he be all togyther a stocke and no man.

               Who els but the bysshop of Rome, wellheed of al lawes. And yet may he at his pleasure both abrogate & expounde, wrythe, & wrest them how soeuer he semeth best, for his ꝓfyte.

               An vnhappy pope by my trouthe, whiche may delude, not onely a coū
                  sell, but also god hym selfe. Neuertheles agaynste suche a wretche as yu hast described to me euen very now. That is to say an open maintener of mischief / a drōkerde / a manqueller / a symoniake / a poysoner / a ꝑiurer / an extorcyoner / an open buggerer. A coūsel is not so moche to be desyred, as all the multitude armed wt stones to kyl hȳ, as a cōmen pestilēce of al the

worlde. But go forthe & tel me, for what cause thou abhorrest so moche a general coūsell?
            
            
               Iul.
               Nay, but fyrst of al, aske this one thyng of great princes of the worlde / wherfore they hate great semblees, & temporal parlyamentes. Sure ye cause is, yt at the great confluence of so many honorable prelates, ye dignyte of the pope is somthynge shadowed, & suffreth some domage. And it fortuneth euer in suche semblees, yt they whiche be of great lernyng & iudgement, theyr cōninge maketh them bolde to speke, suche as haue a clere cons

                  ience speake more liberally than is expedient for vs. And lykewyse some there be called to great offyce and rule, which vse theyr auctorite and power to the vttermost. Amonge whom cōmeth cō
                  menly many, which sore disdeyneth our glory. And at theyr cōmynge be of this entent, that they wolde pare away parte, bothe of our auctoryte & rychesse. The worst of al is, that there sytteth neither better nor worse, but he thynketh yt he may speake lefully agaynst the pope, by reason yt he is one of the coūsel, whiche elles durst not ones say, buffe. Therfore I knewe neuer counsell yt chaunsed so well, but ye pope hath had some of his fethers plucked / wherunto yu may bere wytnes thy selfe, oneles yu haue clene forgoten, For although your counsel holden at Ierusalem, were but for tryflynge maters, neyther of hole empyres, & kynges raunsoms, as ours be now. Yet Iames was not afrayde to adde a great pece of his owne mynde, after yu haddest gyuen sentēce. As it is euident in ye .xv. chap. of ye actes. For whā yu haddest

clene delyuered ye Gentyles al togyther fro ye burden of Moyses lawe, Iames reasonyng after the, excepted fornycacion, cloked blood, and eatyng of thinges offred to ydolles. Correctyng as it were thyne or

               Than it recketh lytel of takynge an othe, seynge he wyl dispence wt al at his pleasure.
            
            
               Iul.
               Nay, to speake ye truthe playnly, that was somwhat beyond good fassyon / but there was no better shyfte to be made. Besyde this, whan I espyed it wolde come to passe, that by ye enuy of the coūsel I sholde in many places be thyrst vnder fete, namely whā it was prouulgate, not to exclude me. But they prayed me in the humblest wyse to syt as resydent in the coūsell. Merke what a prety wyle I founde here, folowyng ye trade of my predecessours. I lykewyse appeled to the counsel nexte to come cō
                  playnynge, and feynynge cause, yt neyther the tyme nor place whiche they appoynted was conuenyent. And by & by sōmoned a counsel to be kepte at Rome. where I supposed none other wolde come, but Iulius frendes, or y• wolde be intreated, for so I lerned by many examples. And in all haste to this purpose I created many suche cardinals, which I thought mete for to bryng my maters aboute.
            
            
               Gen.
               That is to say of the most vnthryftes,
            
            
               Iul.
               And agayne this coūsel, oneles it had ben sōmoned by me, had ben no counsel at all. And yet for al that, it was not greatly expedient for my maters yt suche a company of bysshops / and abbottes sholde come thyther. Amonge whom it coude not be thought, but that some shold be godly & wel dysposed persones. Therfore I gaue them warnynge to spare theyr purses: and euery

countre sholde sende but one or two at the vttermost Notwtstandyng whan I ꝑceyued this deuyse scant sure inough / and yt those fewe of so many sondry prouinces sholde al togither amount to ouer great a nō
                  bre for me. I sent them worde aboute ye tyme yt they were preparing them to take iourney, to defer theyr cōming for yt tyme. And yt ye coūsel shold be proroged vnto an other tyme. Feynyng for ye same prorogaciō many probable and apparēt causes / and agayne by suche maner of pollycyes all luche thynges dashte. I preuentynge ones agayne ye day prescrybed helde a counsel at Rome / wt suche alone as I prouyded for the same intent. Amonge whom also yf there was any yt durst be so bolde to desent fro me. yet I was sure yt ye proudest of thē al durst not resist me. I was so ferre aboue them al in artillery & souldiers. Now I brought this scismatyke cōuentycle of Fraūce in suche hatred, by this maner that foloweth. Fyrst I sent out letters agaynst ye coūsel whiche was kepte in Fraunce, to euery coūtre / where I made mēcion of our moost holy counsel holden at Rome, cursynge theyr counsel / callynge it oftentymes, the cōuenticle of Sathan / the deuyls parlyamēthous / a cōspiracy of scismatikes, against ye holy chyrche.
            
            
               Pe.
               I thinke those cardynalles, which were the authors & doers of yt wycked counsell must nedes be false traytours.
            
            
               Iul.
               As for theyr falshode I let passe. But the chief capitayne of all this besynes, was the cardinall of Roan, who euer applyed hym selfe (by what a popishe holynes I wote not) to redresse the maners of

the chyrche, and lykewyse shewed his tendre loue in diuers places / but deth happely toke him, to whom succeded a spanyshe cardinal, a good lyuer, wel aged and a doctour of diuynite, which people be wont to be vnfrendly to ye popes of Rome.
            
            
               Pe.
               But had your man, which thou namest to be lerned in diuynite no ꝓbable reasons to lay for yt which he dyd.
            
            
               Iul.
               Yes, to many. For he sayd yt there was neuer so vnquyet a world as it was at those dayes. And yt the chyrche had neuer more nede to haue her sykenes cured and healed. And therfore (he sayde) it was my duety to helpe it wt a general counsell. Also that I had taken myn othe at my 
                     •
                  reacyon, to sōmonde it within two yeres after. Yea, so to be bounde by vertue of myn othe, yt I myght in no wyse be dispensed therwith. No not by the consent of the collleyge of cardinalles And yt it had ben often put in remembraunce of my brethren ye cardynals, & instantly desyred. Also often instaunsed by great princes / and how I coude in no wyse here of it. In so moche they sayd, yt euery man myght se, as longe as Iulius was lyuynge, there was no lykelyhode to haue any coūsel. Therto they alleged agaynst me the exāples of ye counsels holden by our predecessours, to bynde me therto. And alleged moreouer certeyne auntike lawes, to proue that I & myn adherentes dyd refuse a connsel. And thervpon yt the very auctoryte to let call it dyd pertayne vnto them. But for so moche as other prīces did also (for the popes pleasure) winke at the mater / yt than the auctoryte to somonde the counsell dyd rest onely

in the emperour of Rome, the whiche was wont in tyme past to cōmaunde it at his owne wyll. And to the fr

Nor a man can not thinke ī what enuy I was brought by theyr meke & colde fassyon / specially bycause they saused al theyr wrytinges in with holy scrypture, wherby it semed some well lerned men were procured for that purpose.

               Yea, but I quake for to speake of them. These moost vngracyous wretches wente fyrst aboute to brynge the holy chyrche (moost flourysshynge nowe bothe in domynions & inestimable rychesses) to her olde beggery & myserable pouerte wherin she was in the apostles tyme, and to brynge the cardynalles (Whiche in all worldly porte, at this day passen fer all kynges chrystened) to some poore lyfe. That bysshops abbottes, & other prelates sholde lyue moche more scarcely, & to be content wt fewe waytyng men and horses / and as some say hoores. And that ye cardynalles sholde not so vniuersally swalowe vp both byshoprykes / abbeyes / & benefices. And yt no man sholde kepe two bysshoprykes. And yt suche preestes as wolde heape benefice vpon benefice tyll they had vi.C. at ones / and care not if they might be suffred, sholde be corrected, and be content wt suche a lyuinge as might suffyse a sobre and honest preest. An other was, that neyther pope / bysshop / nor preest, sholde be made for money, fauour, or flatterynge seruyce / 

but onely for his pure lyfe. But yf ye contrary sholde chaunce, that he sholde by & by be deposed. Yea yt it was also lauful to thrust out ye pope also, if he were knowne an euyl lyuer. And yt dronken and lecherous bysshops sholde be put from administracyon. That prestes which were openly knowne hooremongers and mysdoers, sholde lese, not onely theyr benefyce, but also be gelded / wt many suche lyke (I am wery to shewe al) which were onely to lode vs wt holynes takynge away our rychesse & dominion.

               What was ordeyned agaynst these in your holy counsell at Rome.
            
            
               Iul.
               Me thinketh yu hast an yl remēbraunce. I tolde the before that myn entent was nothing els but vnder the pretence of a counsel (as the prouerbe sayth) to dryue forthe one pegge with an other. My fyrst syttinge was dryuen forth wt certeyne ceremonyes, & auntyke customes, whiche pleased me well inough, although they were nothing at al material. There were two solēpne masses, one of ye holy crosse an other of ye holy goost, as though that al togyther sholde be cōduced & led by his holy inspiraciō. Than after was made a goodly oracion, all to the lawde of my holynes. In ye nexte syttyng I cursed as depely as I coude those scismatyke cardynalles pronounsynge, as dampnable, accursed, and heresy, all those thynges, ye which they had decreed, or sholde decree. At the thyrde metynge I did excōmunicate or curse the realme of Fraunce / and chaunged ye Martes fro the cite of Lyons. And neuertheles in the sayd interdiction, I excepted by name certeyn places of ye said

realme. And all this was to alyene and tourne the hertes of al ye people from theyr kynge. And to reyse some rebel & sediciō amonge thēselues. And for to cō
                  fyrme ye same, I sent out ye curse vnder my bulles of leade, to suche princes & gouernours as I perceiued propense and bowynge towarde our pretenced factions and sedicions.
            
            
               Pe.
               But dyd they nothyng elles?
            
            
               Iul.
               That thynge was done whiche I desyred, for if our deuises be regarded I know I haue ye victory As for those .iij. cardynalles whiche were so styffe agaynst me in those noughty maters, I with all solempnite belongynge therto, depryued theyr cardynalshyps. I haue also gyuen all ye pencions of theyr benefices to other beinge frendly to me / so that they can neuer be restored to them agayne. Themselues I haue gyuen to sathan, moche rather wyllynge to brenne them clene vp, yf I myght catche them.
            
            
               Pe.
               Mary, but yet for all that, if all be as yu doest say, the decrees of that scismatical parlyament semeth to be moche more holy, thā is thy holy synode, wherof I se nothynge els at all, but tyrannous thretnynges / cursynges / and great cruelnes mengled wt myschief and deceyte. And yf so be that Sathan was in dede as thou sayest, the author of the sayde parlyament. Surely me thynketh ye deuyl goeth more nigh vnto Christ than ye sory goost, the holy goost I wolde say, whom ye bost the moderatour of your holy counsel.
            
            
               Iul.
               Nay but take good hede what yu saist. For in al my bulles I haue cursed al suche which fauoureth by worde or dede that same false conuentycle.

               All that is as it pleaseth fortune. Neuertheles we haue more money in our party, for as for Fraūce is nowe wt longe warres sterke beggered. England which I suppose be my frendes, hath yet hylles of golde vntouched. But this I maye be sure of: Yf Fraunce haue ye victory as god forfende, there must nedes be a great and horryble chaunge. Than shall our holy counsel of Rome be called ye conuenticle of sathan, and I an ydoll of a pope. And the holy goost is all togyther theyrs / & we haue done all

               What? For what cause doth the cōmens gyue to theyr heedes what soeuer they do demaunde? but to knowlege yt they possesse what soeuer they haue by lycence of theyr princes, yea thoughe they receyued neuer of them one myte, euen so what soeuer ye ꝓphane sorte hath any where perteynyng vnto godlynes, yt must be imputed vnto vs, as our dede / yea albeit we do but slombre all our lyfe tyme. And yet also besyde all this, we do gyue moost large indulgences, & pardons. And that for a very smal sōme of money. And moreouer we do also dispence after the same wise, in great weighty maters. We gyue our holy blyssynges, in euery place where we come / yea and y• all togyther Gratis.

               I do not know, what so moche as one of al these maters doth meane. But retorne agayne to the effecte of the purpose. For what maner of cause did thy holynes so moche dispyse these alyens, & barbariens? as yu callest them. So that yu haddest rather set al on heapes, thā to suffre them styl in Ytaly.

               I wyl tel the. All these barbarous sorte (but in especial the frenche men) be very persticyous. And as for ye spanyardes dyffers not moche from vs, neither in language nor maners: Yet notwithstandyng I wolde haue vtterly exiled them as wel as ye other, to thentent that we might haue vsed al togyther our owne

               Wel, as for suche names I let passe, but the thynges selfe doth so moche reigne amonge you as I thy

               Neyther those barbariens are al without vice. But bicause they be infect wt other maladyes, they wȳke at theyr owne, and cry out vpon ours. And we on the other syde do fauour our owne ded, & abhor theyrs. We esteme pouertie none other wyse than a greate offence, and to be eschewed of al men, though it force not howe. They contrary wyse thinke it a poynte of a scarse good christyan to haboūde in riches, though they be goten without fraude or gyle. We darre not so moche as ones name dronkenshyp. Neuertheles the Almaynes thynketh it a lyght faute. yea rather a mery iape or pastaūce thā offence. Albeit we wyll not so moche dyffer for this, if we agreed in al other maters / they abhor greatly vsury / neuertheles we

thynke no maner men vnder heuen, so mete for the chyrche of Rome. As for buggery, they reken so detestable, that if so be a man do but ons name it, they thinke both the ayre and sonne, by & by enfected, and also polluted. But we Italiens be not al togither of that minde. As for symony whose name was longe sith gone and banysshed, they flee as the deuyll doth holy water / agaynst whiche they had made certeyn lawes, though they be now out of vse, albeit here in our conceyte is somwhat differynge / & many suche other they be infect wt, which be clene cōtrary to our fassyō of liuyng. In so moche thā as we be so cōtrary to them ī our maner of lyfe: so moche more necessary it is to kepe them from knowlege of our secretꝭ, The more they be ignoraunt of our maners; ye more praise they wyl gyue vs. For if they ones knewe the secretes of our courte, they wolde surely vtter them to our rebuke. For how euer it fortune / they be somwhat quycke in reprouynge theyr neyghboures fautes. They wryte cursed bytynge bokes agaynst the abusynge of some of theyr countree. They preache and cry euery where, that the see of Rome is not the see of Chryste, but rather the greate pumpe of Sathan. They dispute of myne auctoryte and power, whether I came by ye popedom by reasō of my good lyuing, or no. Also if I ought to be taken as gods vycar or not? And so fyrst of al by this meanes they dimynishe ye good opynion that the people had in vs / and so consequently abateth our authorite and rule. For before suche brabblinges, the people herd neuer

other thinge of vs, but that we dyd bere the rowme of Christ / & that we had the nexte authoryte to god / yea rather chek mate with hym. But by reason of suche vnprofytable opynions, ye chyrche susteyneth intollerable domage. For we vtter nowe fewer dispensacyons, and suche other wares, and be fayne to sell them better cheape. Also our rente & casualtees is lesse leuyed of bysshoprykes / abbotshyppes / and other benefyces. Yea and ye people payeth wt moche worse wyll that whiche is requyred of them. To be shorte, our rentes on euery syde decaieth, our fayers and markettes waxeth barayne. And that is moost of all to be lamented, our dredfull dartes be lesse and lesse feared. But if theyr malipertnes come to suche a wylfull and beestly boldenes, that they dare ones say that the pope beinge cursed of god, can hurte no man with his curse, and so dispyse cursynges / than it wyll shortly come to passe, that we shal surely dye for hongre, but yf they be kepte farther of from reasonynge of suche maters, and rather be broughte in feare of our curses. For than suche is the nature of suche stoborne lowtes, yt they wyll haue vs in great awe and reuerence. And so shall we with our bulles and other instrumentes (yf they be discretely handled) ordre al thinges as we wolde haue it.
            
            
               Pe.
               It is an heuy case if thauctoryte of the pope and bisshops depende vpon this hasarde, only yt yf theyr noughty lyuynge were knowne, they were euen vtterly vndone. For whan we lyued vpon erthe truely we coueyted nothyng more than yt all yt we dyd myght be

knowne, yea that whiche we dyd in our preuy chā
                  bres. For we were moost regarded whan our lyues were moost manyfest and knowne. But one thynge I pray the / be the princes so godly nowe adayes, as thou reportest theym / or do they so moche feare the preestes: as to renne one vpon an other, euen at the becke of suche an holy plate, as it might be thyselfe? For in my tyme I remembre well, they were ye extremest enmyes we had.
            
            
               Iul.
               As touchynge theyr godly lyuyng, they be not (thanked be god) very supersticious. And as to our honour they regarde not very moche / but maketh vs theyr laughinge stockꝭ, excepte some certeyne of spyced conscience / which so moche feareth our thondrebolte & curse / as thoughe it coude hurte them yt deserued it not. And yet those same persones all togyther ignoraunt in the nature of the thynge, be onely moued of a mad spyced conscience, rote
                     •
                   by longe custome of time. Some there be lykewyse, whiche for the hope they haue to come to our riches / and some for feare of vs, do gyue place to our dignyte. Other there be yt thynke veryly they shall come to an yll ende, whiche in any wyse doeth hurte a prest, what maner a lyuer soeuer he be. And mooste comenly all men, the more gentylly they be brought vp, the more they regarde our ceremonies: prouoked therto by suche prety feates as we haue deuysed, but to comen people they be as fables and disgysingꝭ. Neuertheles we practise more weighty maters by meanes therof. For somtyme we paynte and set out the great princes of the worlde wt gloryous

tytles, callynge hym defender of the chyrche, an other defender of the faythe, though it be nothynge so, & al suche as wil ayde vs, our welbeloued sones. They on the other syde, call vs in al theyr wrytingꝭ most holy fathers, and somtyme they submyt them for to kysse our holy fete. Nowe and than in thinges of no estimacyon gyue place to our power, to the entent they might be called vertuous prīces. We send to some halowed roses / cappes of mayntenaunce / swerdes, & suche other. And also longe & large bulles to confyrme theyr dignyte. And they sende agayn to vs fayre coursers / men of warre & money / yea somtyme fayre yonge chyldren. And thus one of vs claweth an other, as mules be wonte.

               Yf they be so spyced conscyence: yet I do not well ꝑceyue howe thou sholdest so sone styre thē vp to so great warres, seinge thou hast broken so many truces with them.
            
            
               Iul.
               Yet yf thou be able to perceyue these thynges whiche I wyll tell the yu shalt perceyue a cōueyaūce ferre aboue any of thappostles.

               Iul.
               Fyrst of al my study was euer to know ye natural īclinacion of al coūtrees: but namely of princes & rulers, & in lykewise theyr cōdicyons, affections, power, & endeuermentes / whiche of them wer frendes, and whiche not. And so to vse euery & singuler of them to our cōmodite & profyte.
               ¶And to begyn withall, I reysed the frenche men agaynst the Uenyciens / renewynge the olde festred malyce which had be betwyxt thē longe before / perceyuyng moreouer the vnsacyable lust of the frenchemen

to amplyfy theyr domynion, & that ye Uenyciēs did vniustly wthold dyuers of theyr cities, wherupō I intermedled my cause wt theyrs, & so toke a parte wt Fraunce agaynst the other, & so dyd Maximilyan also / although he fauored them but fayntly, not knowyng any other meanes to redeme suche fayre townes as ye Uenyciens wthelde from hym. But shortly after whan the frenche men began to be more welthy, thā my wyll was, for (to say as I thinke) they had but ouer good chaunce at that tyme. I not long after founde meanes to reyse the kynge of Spayne (a man of no great constancy) agaynst them. Whose profyte it also somwhat touched, yt the frēche mens fethers sholde be blucked, and yt for dyuers maters. But namely, leest it myght be theyr chaūce to flee in to his lordeshyp of Neaples, and put hym out. And albeit I loued in no wise ye Uenyciens: yet for a face I made them my frēdes, to thende I my myght set them vpon the frenche dogges. Whiche Uenyciens were not longe before sore vexed of the frenche men. And agayne I made the emperour & them twayne, whome a lytell before I had made all one. This I brought to corum, wt certeyn of my letters to themperour, wherin I feyned the kynges enuy agaynst themperour, & partely with money, which beareth euer a great stroke wt suche men as haue nede. After I had renewed agayne the festred wrathe whiche Maximylian bare agaynst the frēche curres, wherwith ye man wolde haue merueylously fret hȳselfe / yea though he coude in no wyse reuenge his cause.

Ouer this I was perfyte of the deedly enmyte bytwene ye Englyshe men & the frenche men. Betwyxt the scottes also & the frenche men. Moreouer I perceyued the englysshe nacyon very welthy, ferce, and desyrous of batayle / and that specyally where any thynge is to gete / & also somwhat supersticyous, for the ferre distaunce from Rome. Finally they beinge somwhat wanton, halfe at sedicyon amonge them selues: so that I thought it easy ynoughe to encyte them agaynst the frenche men. All these pagyentes I played, for the auaūtage of the chyrche. Than after I wrapped the princes in deedly warres wt my crafty letters: not leuyng so moche as one in al christendom vnattempte co the same. Neyther ye kynge of Hongary / nor yet of Po
                     •
                  tyngale / nor the duke of Burgony, a man nothynge inferyor in domynion to many kynges. But bycause that mater perteyn
                     •
                  d nothynge to them, I coude in no wyse induce them to i
                     •
                  uade the frenche men. But one thing I perceyued wel, yt if the other princes fell ones by the eares togyther, they sholde not be in quyetnes. Now these princes which by my practised polycy made warre one agaynst an other receyued of me agayn for theyr good seruyce gloryous tytles, to thende they myght be brought to byleue yt the more chrysten blood they shed, ye more godly they appered to defend ye chyrche of god. But that yu mayst the more cōmend my clene conueyaunce & happy chaūce / the same tyme it fortuned the kynge af Spayne helde warres with the Turkes, whiche torned to his great cōmodyte, and

profyte. Yet he leuynge all togyther came downe wt all his power to ayde me agaynst the frenche men. And although I had incitate the emperour agaynst thē, as I sayd before / yet was he other wyse boūde by dyuers cōposicyons, betwene hym and me. Albe it that he (by theyr manyfolde benefytes and ayde) had wonne agayn his townes in Ytaly. And besyde all this, that he had moche to do of his owne / as to socoure his neuewe ye duke of Burgony, agaynst his mortal enmy the duke of Gelders. Yet I brought to passe that he lefte his neuewe in ye bryers: and toke vpon him (for my pleasure) to warre agaȳst Fraūce And farthermore although there be no nacyon that passeth lesse vpon the authoryte of ye pope of Rome, than ye Englysshe nacyon, as it is open to hym that lyst to rede & merke well the lyfe of saynt Thomas of Cauntorbury, & the cōstitucions of ye olde kinges. Yet the same prouynce, so impacient of all exactions and taxes, suffred for my pleasure to be shorne to the bare skynne. To speake of ye spiritualty of yt realme, it is wonder to se howe they were wonte to wtholde from ye pope of Rome all they myght, yet to ayde me in my besines were cōtented to pay exactions howe paynfull so euer they were. Not merkyng very dilygently what a wyndowe they opened to theyr lorde and kynge, in so doyng. And to speke ye blunte truthe the kynge and his nobylles was not than most cyrcūspecte to suffre suche exactions to be gathered in his realme. ¶But to shewe by what craftes I bronght these chrysten princes one agaynst an other

it were very tedious. Whiche prīces no pope before me, coude at any tyme styre vp agaynst the Turke.

               O madde Bedlem, what crakest thou of thy power, whan I here nothynge elles hytherto, but an vnpreestly and worldly capytayne. Thou gloryest that thou arte able to breake peas betwene prynces / to cause batayles / to cause them murdre one an other, which power belongeth to the deuyll / not to Chrystes vicare, to whome it behoueth to folowe as nyghe as can be his example. There is in hym (I graunt) an hye power as can be, but suche a power as ought to be ioyned wt moost hyghe wysdome, and knowlege of gods worde / and therby at all tymes ruled. There ought to be in him the wysdome of serpentes: but withall muste be ioyned the simplycite of a douue. In the surely I se the ymage of power, coupled with great malyce and folishnes: so that yf the deuyll wolde make a deputy, he coude chuse none more mete than one lyke to the.

He bosteth howe many he hath begoten in Chryst / how many he hath withdrawen from wyckednes and vngodly lyuynge / and not (as thou doest) how many .M. duccates he hath heaped togyther.

               Pe.
               I thinke ye same. For how sholdest thou haue any tyme to rede ouer the holy gospelles, and the epystles (which my brother Paule & I dyd wryte) beyng alwayes besyed aboute so many ībassades, so many legeys, accomptes, so many armyes and tryūphes. The study of scriptures requyreth a mynde voyde of al worldly cares. The discyplyne of Christ doth also requyre a brest clene purged from ye spotte of all worldly besynes. Thou mayst be well assured that so great a doctor as Chryst was, came not downe from heuen to teache vs any vulgare or cōmen lernynge. The profession of a christen man is no ydle tyme, nor wtout cares, as to despyse all pleasures as thinges venimous / & treade ryches vnder thy fete as thou wylt do a clot of clay, to set nothing by this lyfe in gods cause & thy neyghbours. This is the professyon of a true christyan. But for bicause these thyngꝭ seme intollerable to suche as be not gouerned

with the spiryte of Christ. Therfore they deflecte and torne them away to vaine and vnfruteful ceremonyes / and vnto suche a Chryst & heed, feyned by themselues, they countrefeyte a lyke body.
            
            
               Iul.
               What good thyng than doest thou leaue me, if thou take away my money / depryue me of my kyngdom / spoile me of myne honour / and bare me of pleasure.
            
            
               Pe.
               By this reason thou countest Chryst hymselfe a very wretche / whiche althoughe he was lorde ouer al togither, yet was made a cōmen laughing stocke / ledyng all his lyfe in pouertie / sweate / fastyng / hungre and thurst / & finally dyed a moost heinous deth.
            
            
               Iul.
               He may perchaūce fynde some yt wyll cōmende his lyfe, but surely he shall fynde none now adayes that wold folow it.
            
            
               Pe.
               Nay not so, for ye very praise of his lyfe, is the folowyng of ye same. Albeit trouth it is yt Christ doth not bereue any of his theyr good. But for suche thynges as are falsly called good / he enrycheth them with the true and eternall ryches / whiche he doth not before he haue purged and take clene awaye theyr flesshly appetytes. For euen lyke as he was all togyther heuēly, so his wyl is to haue his body / that is to say the congregacyon of christen men knyt togyther in his spiryte, to be in all thyngꝭ most lyke to him, that is to wyte, clene purged from all spottes of worldlynes. For elles how can he be all one wt him whiche sytteth in heuen moost gloryous and shynynge, yf he were drowned ouer the heed in worldly fylthynes, & dregges. But whan he is ones purged from suche pleasures, whiche be rather displeasures / 

& moreouer from all worldly affections. Than at the last Christ sheweth forth his incomparable treasures, and gyueth vnto his a moost swete taste of his heuēly ioyes, for theyr voluptuous pleasures of this worlde, euer mengled wt a soure sauce.

               What pleasures I pray the.

               Estemed thou the gyftes of prophecy, entrepretyng ye scryptures / the gyfte to worke myracles: but as cōmen gyftes, and no pleasure? Moreouer supposest yu Christ hym selfe but as a vyle persone / whom who soeuer hath hath in his possessyon all togyther? Finally, one

               Iul.
               Ha, ha, ha. Than I se well, ye more wretched lyfe that a man dothe lyue in the worlde / the more delycately he lyueth in Christ / ye more beggerly a man is here, the rycher he is in Chryste / the more abiecte that a man is here, the hygher & more honorable he is in Chryst / the lesse he lyueth in this worlde, the more he lyueth in Christ.
            
            
               Petrus.
               It is surely so / that Christ wyll haue al his body be pure and clene / and namely the mynisters of his worde / that is to wyte the bysshops. And amonge them the higher he is, ye more like he ought for to be to Christ and the lesse ouercharged, and forther from all carnall pleasures. But nowe I se clene the contrarye, that he which wyl be estemed highest in dignitees / and next of all to Christ hymselfe, is most of al ouerwhelmed in all worldly filthynes / as in ryches / domynyon / strength of men / batayles / truces. As for all other vyces. I let passe. And althoughe thou be

neuer so contrary to Chryst / neuertheles thou abusest the tytle of Chryst, for the mayntenaunce of thy deuyllysshe pryde / and vnder the pretence of hym whiche despised the kyngdome of this worlde, thou playest the worldly tyraunt / and beynge the ryghte enmye of Chryst, thou requyrest the ryght honoure dewe vnto hym.

               Wherfore sayst thou so, seynge myne entent hath ben euer to endote the chyrche with all kynde of goodes? But there be dyuers whiche saythe that Arystotle spake of thre maner goodes / wherof some be called the goodes of fortune / other some goodes of the body / and rhe rest goodes of the soule. Wherfore I not wyllynge in any wyse to inuerte and transpose this diuysyon of goodes, began fyrste of all at the goodes of fortune / and perchaunce sholde haue come by lytell and lytel to the goodes of the soule, if that dethe cōmynge the soner vpon, had not to rathe haue taken me out of this worlde.

               It is nothynge so, for yf the poore christen people coude espy in the & suche other, the very gyftes of god, as good lyuynge, holsome doctryne, brennynge charyte, the true enterpretyng of goddes worde, with other vertues requysyte to the true vycare of Christ / yea, and they wolde the rather worshyp the, bycause they perceyue the pure and clene from all worldely and

               Iulius.
               Wylte thou not than open the gates?
            
            
               Petrus.
               To any other rather than to suche a pestylent wretche. For to the in thy conceyte, we be all no better than excōmunycate persons. But wylt thou haue a good and profytable counsell? Thou hast a company of worthy warryours, innumerable rychesse / thy selfe a wyse buylder / therfore go buylde the a newe paradyse, but take hede it be wel defended, that it be not beaten downe of yll spirites.

               No syr. I shall do a thyng that shall please me a lytell better. I wyll tary a fewe monethes, tyl my company be better encreased, and stronger / and than I wyll retorne and dryue you clene out of this holde with stronge hande, onlesse you wyl yelde you vnto me. For I doubte not but within a short space here wyll be aboue .lx.M. slayne in batayle.

               No for god, it neded not. For he ran̄e so hastyly of his owne courage, that I coud scarce ouer take hym with any wynges.

               Of trouthe I maruayle nothyng at al, that so fewe cōmeth to this place, whan so pestylent caytyfes be

Which thynge causeth me often to marueyle at them that saye, the Pope of Rome (as they call hym) can not erre. For compare his lyfe to the lyuynge of Timothe, or Paule / and I suppose thou shalte fynde very lytell agreynge. But Alas, in howe myserable case were they whiche sate in the carte, when suche a

But yf we consydre this sore scourge wherwith god punished vs so many yeres, it is hyghe tyme to submytte and humble our selues vnto hym whiche wyll gyue vs to drynke of the water, not whiche the venimous Natryx hath infecte with her poyson: but suche wherof yf we drynke, it shall make in vs a well of water, leapyng in to eternall lyfe: which Chryste graunte vs all.
