In which discourse alreadie extant, (gentle Readers) you haue vnderstood, howe the Emperour Palmerin so looued and honored Knights errant, that from the furthest parts of the world they came to his Courte, because yéerelie hee continued a sumptuous spectacle in forme of a Tourney, for the exercise of knightly and millitarie discipline: and with such religious zeale was this worthy practise folowed, as the Court might well be called yt Schoole of Armes, and Nursse of ciuilitie. For this cause, many Kinges, Princes, and great Lordes, sent their Sonnes to bee there educated, among whom, the good Knight Frysoll King of Hungaria sent one of his, named Belcar, and the Duke Eustace of Mecana another, called Tirendos: that they might deserue their knightho

               After many and sundry thoughts, that fought together within his spirit, he concluded to depart acccmpanied but with one Squire, and that so secretly as could be deuised.

The Squire that came with these thrée brethren, séeing the bad fortune of his Maisters Sons, rode presently backe to the Castel, and finding the aged Knight in his Chamber, thus began.

It was the Duke of Pontus and Durace, who rode to Macedon, to the mariage which the King Florendos had made, betwéene his Daughter Denisa & the King of Thrace, Nephew to the Wife of Caniano. This Duke had his espoused Lady Laurana with him, as also one of his fayre Daughters named Alderina, who rode formost

                     •…
                  om what mooued, because shee desired to knowe of whence hee was, thus spake. Sir Knight, abide héere hardlie at your ease, and for our comming doo not for sake a place so swéete and delectable: you sée the heate of the daie is such, as scantlie will permit yee to trauaile. If you goe to aduenture your fortune in the Tourney at Macedon, you may ride with the Duke my Father, who will be verie glad of your companie: & much more my selfe, because my good hap was first to finde you héere.
               
                  Belcar, humblie thanking her for this courtesie, made an excuse that he could not goe to Macedon, because he had vrgent asfaires els where, and whether he must trauel with all spéede: wherefore taking his leaue againe of her, hee rode which waie him liked best, onely to escape vnknown of this companie. And méeting a Squire, that came after the traine with the cariage, he demaunded if he knew the Lord that rode by so well accompanied, to whom y• Squire aunswered, that it was the Duke of Pontus, who rode to Macedon, to the feaste of the King Florendos, for the mariage of his Daughter Denisa, and y• the Duke had his fayre Daughter Alderina with him, to sée the Iousts and Turnament which was nowe prepared. So soone as Belcar heard these words, he presentlie coniectured, that the Lady which came first to the Fountain was the Dukes daughter, of whom report had made great commendation. Héervppon he determined to goe sée this assemblie, in the most secrete manner he could deuise: for he had time enough to accomplish his voiage. So for sooke hee the way to the Isle of Carderia, framing his iourney toward Macedon, and com ming néere the Cittie, he ouertooke two Knights y• rode to the Tryumphe: they hauing riciprocallie saluted eache

Thus rode they on fréendlie together, and arriuing at Macedon, they founde the Fielde all couered with Tents, which belonged to the Noble personages that were come to the feaste. For this cause, the two Knights gaue in charge to their Squires, to prouide their Pauillion, which was purposelie brought with them, intreating Belcar like wise to kéepe them companie: whereto (because hee woulde not enter the Cittie) he gladlie consented, thin

               On the morrow there arriued the Duke of Pontus, before whom rode y• King Florendos, as one willing to welcome his newe kinred: but Alderina shewed such maiesly in countenance, as euerie eye wondred at her rare perfections, not withstanding, she was some what sad & pensiuethe cause proceeding from her desire, to know the Knight she saw at the Fountaine, whom yet she could not by anie meanes forgette. When Belcar behelde her arme in arme with the King of Thrace, and in what costlie garments she was attired: hee imagined her more faire then when hee sawe her at the Fountaine, so that he resolutlie intended, if hee coulde not

               On the morrow following, the King, the Nuéene and the newe maried couple, came into the Field to behold the Turney, where they were no sooner mounted on the Scaffoldes, which were sumptuously adorned as beséemed so

great personages: but bothe on the one side and the other, they might behold great store of armed Knights, chéefelie they that came from the Court of the Emperour, who because he could not be present at his Sisters mariage, sent manie of his balde Barons to honour the assemblie. The braue exploits in feates of Armes there performed, surpassed them of greatest reputation, & among other, the Dukes of Anemon and Mensa so well behaued themselues, as they had well néere gained the honour of the first assaulte, if Belcar had not suddainlie arriued, who staied a while to behold the order of the Io

Then breaking in amidst the preasse, he gaue such sharpe entertainement to all that met him, as the King Florendos, and the other great estates that accompanied him, were driuen thereby into great admiration: nor was he knowne to anie there but the Princesse Alderina, who being seated on the right hand of y• Quéene Denisa, could not smoother her thought

                  Howe Belcar fearing to be knowne, departed secretlie from Macedon, & by the way met with a Knight whom he vanquished: and how he fought a cruell combat with him that defended the bridge, where the faire Francelina was enchaunted.
               
               
                  SO soone as Belcar hadde ended with Alderinaes Squire, hee minded to departe presentlie, fearing least the King Florendos would sende for him, as indeede he did soone after: for hee greatlye desired to knowe the Knight, that bare away the honour of the Tourney. But hys

expectation was greatlie deceiued, in that Belcar was alreadi

               And ryding along the way where hee met Alderina, he happened into a faire greene Meddow, where (because no lodging was néere at hand) he determined to make his hostage that night: but as hee thought to enter a sounde sleepe, a suddaine imagination caught hold on his sences, presenting them with the rare beautie of Alderina, during which passion, he was constrained thus to parle with himselfe.

After many amorous discourses, he concluded (if hee could finish the aduenture of Francelina) to make choyse of thys Ladie onelie as his Wife.

In these conceits hee consumed the night, and in the morning (hauing Armed himselfe) came to the Brydge, where in a con uenient place neere the first Towre, he espied the Knight that defended the passage: whose huge stature somewhat amazed Belcar, and as he

                     BElcar beeing indiffer ently calmed by the courteous behauiour of Lypes, determined to recouer his passed foyle by actions of Chiualrie, and therefore resolued to cōtinue in that place, to combat with al such as came to trie the aduenture: but to his intent hee added this principally, y• what déeds of Armes he there performed, or in anie other place where he might be imployed, all should be for the loue of Alderina, Daughter to the Duke of Pontus, whom aboue all other he meant most constantly to ioue. And if his fortune were to be vanquished by anie Knight, he woulde then forthwith returne to the Cour

                   of the King Florendos. This disseigne he discouered to Lypes, who was not a little glad therof, saying, that he should apprehend great matters by his enterprise, because continually many good Knights resorted thither. And because (quoth hee) you are so resolutlie minded, nothing shal make mee to forsake your company: but to behold the knightly Chiualrie, which I am out of doubt to sée executed by you. I offer my selfe to accōpanie you in al loyall seruice. Nowe the better to furnish their wants, hee sent to his Mothers house for all kind of prouision, y• might agrée with the time of their abode there. By this time

When Belcar sawe him make so couragiouslie toward the Bridge, he mounted on horsebacke, and comming to him, thus spake.

Great boldnes is this in you (aunswered the Marquesse) that you will take in hande to beare a burthen of such waight: but I thinke you doo it to this ende, that you would depart hence with greater shame and confusion, then euer you sustained héeretofore. That quarrell (quoth Belcar) shall our Swordes soone discide, and so without any more spéeches they fell to the Combat, wherein the Marquesse she wed verie knightlie and gallant behauiour, albeit Belcar cast him from his Saddle, and afterwarde fought with him on foote a long while: but in the end the Marquesse was vanquished, and vnderstanding the name of his Conquerour, returned to the place where hee left his companie, and after he had recouered better health, he rode straite to Macedon, where he recounted his ouerthrowe by Belcar. Of these newes the King Florendos and y• Quéene were verie ioyfull, saying they had a Nephew that was so named, wherefore they desired to knowe what Armes hee wore? when the Marquesse tolde them hee was in Greene Armour. Without question (quoth the King) it was the same

But after they had sayled halfe a daie, a violent contrarie winde arose, which droue them thrée daies and thrée nights so furiously, as the Marriners coulde scant tell in what part they were. At length this rough and boysterous tempest ceased, when Palmendos beeing desirous to know in what Country they were: was aunswered by the Maister that they were in Europe and the Mediterranian Sea, verie neare to the Isle of Delphos, where after so long and vncomfortable wether, Palmendos wold goe on land to refresh himselfe.

               Yet not withstanding, there was in this Island a great aduenture, for in the time of the Gentiles, there inhabited a welthy Prieste, a Magitian and wonderfull inueftigatour of hidden thinges, hee was high Priest of the Sanctuarie in the Temple, as also he had the generall administration through the whole Prouince: he hauing a comlie beautiful Daughter, endued with al vertues requisite in a Uirgin, and her he gaue to the seruice of the Oracle. It so fell out, that the Duke of Feria, a very gentle and gracious youth, became enamoured of her onely by report, for oftentimes he had hearde her commended, to excéede in beautie the choysest Dames of that Countrey: wherfore he made sundrie requests to enioy her as his Wife, but all his labour was to no purpose, because her father

               The Duke not a little glad of this aunswer, presentlie iournied to the Island, where béeing arriued, hee aduertised the Damosell: that he would stay for her in a conuenient place néere her fathers Pallace, whether she should not fayle to come, so soone as the silent night had brought euery one asleepe.

Neuerthelesse, she was heerein deceiued, for the Sword passing through her right side, shee fell vpon the dead corpes, and so lay awhile aliue, breathing foorth many greeuous sighes and lamentations. And finding in her bosome a shéete of paper, with her owne bloode shee wrote twelue mornefull verses in forme of an Epytaph: then seeing her latest howre to hasten on, with rufull mones she deliuered these speeches. Séeing it is so, my sweete choyse and paragon of cour teste, that for my sake thou hast endured this martyrdome: it will remaine as a gall in my conscience, that I did not ende thy funeralles according to thy desert. And that my Father may knowe what wrong he hath doone vs, I will leaue some occasion for his too late repentaunce: yet I desire no other recompence, but causing our bodies to bee buried in one Coffin, he will suffer (for a perpetuall remembrance of this stratageme) this Epitaphe to be engrauen thereon.
               
                  Forbeare mine eyes more to bemone thy freend,
                  Whose peereles vertues time nor death can staine:
                  Despise the man that thus procurde his ende,
                  And hath (withall) his onely daughter slaine.
                  Ah angrie fate, and planet most vnkinde,
                  What more inhumaine act could ye deuise:
                  Then step betweene the hart, the eye and minde,
                  And pierce that vaine which could them all suffise?
                  But sith in life our fortune was so bad,
                  To misse of that which we desired most:
                  Yet nowe in death the same is freelie had,
                  Wherefore of loue in death we make our boast.
               
               This Epitaphe ended, shee yeelded the humaine tribute to nature, for afterward her bodie made no motion of vitall mouing: and it cannot be esteemed as fabulous that loue should cause the death of anie one, because in auncient Histories, we may finde innumerable of recent & moderne

examples thereof. But returne we to the Pri
                     •…
                  st, who vnderstanding that his Daughter ranne foorth with such a clamour, followed her immediatlie, fearing she woulde offer some violence on herselfe, and finding her deade, holding the Epitaphe in her hand, he was in great daunger to make a third in this wofull tragedie. Ah miserable & desolate wretch (quoth hee) if thy knowledge had efficacie in working the Duke of Ferias death, why was it not sufficient to preuent thy Daughters mishappe? Unhappy was the houre when first I practised this deuillish sorcerie. Many other sorrowful lamentations he made ouer y• dead bodies, whom we may aptlie compare to the loyall Louers Piramus and Thisbie: but afterward hee erected a costlie Sepulchre of Brasse, and hauing embalmed them according to the auncient ceremonies of funerall pompe, hee intombed them in the Temple bothe together, and caused the Epytaphe to be cunningly grauen thereon. Not long after, considering himselfe depriued of his lawfull heyre, and howe greatly he had peruerted the course of nature, very extreame greefe ended his daies: but ere he died, hee enclosed the Treasure of the Temple with such enchaunt ments, and with so strong and fearefull a guard, that from the time of his death, it was very dangerous to come néere the place. And tell the time of Palmendos arriuall there, there durst not anie one make tryall thereof, albeit before Baledon abused the Islande, Knights of diuers Regions came to prooue theyr fortune: and y• Giant himselfe came thether for the same occasion, but séeing hee coulde not approche the Temple, perceiuing the Island to be faire and delectable: he got it by force of Armes, the people thereof beeing vnable to resist his hostilitie.
               Let vs nowe remember where we left before, the arriuall of Palmendos in this Islande of Delphos, to whome one of the Marriners told all these thinges, as also the horrible villanies of the Gyant: wherefore he intreated him not to anker in that Porte, because (quoth he) we shal all

bee either slayne or taken prysoners. Why? sayd Palmendos, is no man able to punish his pryde and tyrannie? seeing Fortune hath conducted me hether, and will permitte me but to haue a sight of him: I will not departe without some proofe of my selfe. For if I bee Sonne to the Emperour Palmerin, I must not bee frighted with the name of Gyants, who rather resemble huge Colosses without anie soules, then humaine creatures: much lesse strange aduentures, howe harde and daungerous soeuer they seeme. If I woulde acquire prayse and honour immortall, long time must I followe millitarie cxercise, as my Father did in his yonger dayes, preuailing against diuers such Monsters, & bringing innumerable enterprises to happy ende: turne prowe then towarde shore, and boldlie let vs enter the Porte, without anie feare of this difformed Golias. With much a doo they sette into the Porte, where they were no sooner entred, but they sawe themselues enclosed with the chayne, which sight dismayed bothe the Maister and Marriners: but Palmendos and Ozalio presently put on theyr Helmets and Gauntlets, standing ready for defence of all the rest.
               The Gyant beeing aduertised that a rich Ship was gotte within the chaine, commaunded his Sonne presentlie to take Armes, and with sufficient assistaunts to goe take all the Strangers prysoners: wherto the young Tyrant was very readie, and entring with three Knights into a boate, came directly to the Shippe, where Palmendos standing formost, the Gyants Sonne thus spake to him. Howe darest thou Knight be so bold, as to enter our Porte without licence? I dare doo more then that, answered Palmendos, in despight of such disloyall villaines as you are, who by trecherous meanes intrap the in

                  cent, and afterward exercise what crueltie you please vppon them: but nowe is the time come, I hope, that shal guerdon you with recompence aunswerable to such brutish behauiour. The Gyants Sonne dyspleased with these wordes, sought with

his Knights to enter violently the Ship: but Palmendos and Ozalio beeing to high aboue them, gaue them so many sharpe repulses, as yōung Baledon receiued his deathes wounde at the Princes hande, and Ozalio sent one of the Knights to beare him companie. With this foyle y• boate speedilie returned, and t

                  ey aduertised Baledon what had happened, bringing his Sonne slaine vp into his Chamber, wherwith he was so wōderfully enraged: as he vowed to buy his bloode with the death of all the strangers. In bitter anguish of hart, he called for his Armour, preparing himselfe to the dismall attempt: in meane while the two Knights that escaped backe aliue, stoode on the shore reuiling the Prince, wylling him to prepare, for his death was comming.
               If your Maister (quoth Palmendos) bee so valiant

                  Howe Palmendos came on lande to combat with the Gyant Baledon, whom he vanquished, and afterwarde deliuered many Knights out of his prysons, among whom were two young Princes, beeing Moores: who in trauailing to the Emperours Courte, were by a tempest cast on this Islande.
               
               
                  RIght soone went the Knightes to the Gyant with Palmendos challenge, who béeing very wel pleased therewith, came downe proudelie to y• Port with these speeches. Which is the wretched Knight, that dare so peremptorilie venture on shore, to receiue the death he hath iustly deserued? I am the man, aunswered Palmendos, and I will be so good as my worde, if thou wilt faithfully promise mee safetie from thy people.

These two young Lords were nourished together by the Soldane, because hee behelde the towarde inclination of Rifarano, whom hee euer imagined would prooue a worthie Knight: and for he was Sonne to his Sister

When Rifarano vnderstoode, that he was Sonne to one of the chéefest Princes in Christendome, hee made greater account of himselfe then he did before, and dysposed himselfe to matters of higher quallitie, so that béeing of yeeres to receiue his Knighthoode, he requested the Soldane to honour him therwith: which he with right good will performed, causing Ioustes and Tournaments to sollemnize that time withall, wherin

                  Rifarano still bare awaie the pryze. Following Armes and Chiualrie he still continued, and with good successe wunne such fame through all Persia, as y• Soldane thought to ioyne him in marriage with the King Maulerinos eldest Daughter. But he would neuer harken to such matters, for that hee had secretlie vowed, first to sée the Emperour his Father, whereto his Mother (whose dayes long sicknes had new shortened) euermore prouoked him: that Trineus beholding the fruite of her loue, might thinke the better of his acquaintaunce with her.
               After the obsequies and royall funerall, as wel beséemed a Princesse of so great regarde, and Rifarano lothe to stay, his Mother beeing dead: hee desired y• Soldane that he might trauaile to Constantinople, to sée th

with you which I haue deliuered from prison, and present his Maiestie with them from me, as also the wife & daughter of Baledon the Gyant: for it is both iust & reasonable, to dispossesse this Island of such bad people, as haue wyth such horrible tirannies so long time abused the same. For I dare say, the people y• inhabite this Isle, wil more gladly submit themselues to ye Emperors regiment, then be held in slauerie by such helhoundes▪ In meane while, wee wyll leaue some good Knight of this soyle as gouernour thereof in his highnes name, vntil he haue disposed thereof as shal seeme best in his wisedom. Willingly wold I make proofe before your departure, of a strange aduenture couched in the Temple: that if I die in y• attempt, you may reuenge my death, & happilie liue to finish the same▪ 
                  Rifarano and Lecefin made answere, that they would fulfil any thing he pleased to commaunde them, for which Palmendos requited them with many thanks.
            
            
               CHAP. VIII.
               
                  How Palmendos placed in the gouernment of the Isle of Delphos, an auncient wyse Knight named Guillador, by whom he vnderstood the daunger and difficultie of the aduenture in the Temple, whether (notwithstanding) he afterward trauailed: & how he fortunatly ended the same.
               
               
                  AFter all the Knights & Gentlemen had Armed thēselues, Palmendos caused the Gyantesse and her daughter, to be fastened with a strong chaine to a piller, least they shoulde offer some violence on themselues, and the chayne in the Port he comman ded to be taken away, with all

other daungers that might hurt trauaillers: then sonunoning the people of the Island, he thus beganne to conferre with them.
               My Bretheren and Freendes, I cannot thinke but you all reioyce, to see your selues deliuered from the miserable seruitude, wherein the Tyrant Baledon hath long time held you, henceforth therefore I intend, that you shal acknowledge for your liege Lord and S
                     •…
                  ueraigne, the famous & vertuous Emperour Palmerin d'Oliua, to whome I will make present of this Island, which the God of heauen hath su
                     •…
                  fered me to conquere: for you knowe that the Gyant is slaine, his Wife and Daughter likewise remain my prisoners, and to his Maiesty wil I shortly send them. Let me therfore intreate ye, to continue his true and loyall Subiects, and I shall so behaue my selfe with his highnes, as he shall henceforth defend this Island and you: for the gouernment whereof in meane while, I wil leaue one that shall bee chosen among you, who shall sweare to resigne his office, to him whom the Emperour shal please to send hether.
               The Knights & Gentlemen of the Island were greatlie contented, hearing Palmendos vse such gratious speeches, acknowledging themselues happy to remaine y• Emperours vassailes: whereupon they swore fidelity to him, and elected a reuerende Knight of the Island named Guillador, to whom the authoritie of Deputie was committed, and then they caused the Gyants bodie to bee burned, for the horrible villamies he had doone in his life time, to which execution all the people of the Island resorted, not so much for the sight thereof, as to honour the Patrone of their deliueraunce. Euery thing thus wisely and discréetlie pacified, he determined to try the aduenture of ye Temple, whereupon the newe Gouernour desired him, not to

danger thereof consisted, at whose request, Guillador thus beganne the discourse. Know my Lorde, that the Temple wherein our Priestes great Treasure is hidde, is a place now ouergrowne as a thicket of young Trees, by reason of the long time sin

And when anie one dooth offer to enter the Temple, he commeth forth of his denne, and makes him sure for euer returning againe. In sooth, quoth the Prince, these newes are very terrible in hearing, yet neuer was there any aduenture in the world so difficult, but one or other hath accomplisht it, and I trusting onelie in the helpe of God, will try if this enchauntment were ordayned perpetuall, not fearing all y• Bores or deuils in the world.
               I am sure my Lorde, quoth Rifarano, that if you finish not this enchauntment, it will neuer be accomplished by anie other: therefore boldly sette vpon it, for gladly would I endure part of the paine, and by y• faith of a true Knight, I shall assist ye with my vttermost endeuour. No other helpe doo I desire, answered Palmendos, then the fauour of the Gods onelie, and I hope they will not be farre from me, if so I stand in need thereof: notwithstanding, I humblie thanke yee for your good will, and if I happen to fayle in mine enterprise, you shall make no better witnesse of your wordes, then courteously to hazard the aduenture, to recouer the honour lost by me: for which cause, as also to beguile the tediousnes of trauaile, you shal accompany me to the Temple. So wylling the Merchaunts & other prisoners to stay in the Castell, Palmendos, Ozalio, Rifarano, Lecefin and the rest of the Knights, beeing all wel armed, sette toward the Temple, many of the Islande trauailing with them, to guide them the way and doo other néedefull seruices. Now had Palmendos caused to be made by meruailous subtill cunning, a coate of Armes, composed of

ware and other like clammie myxtures, wherewith he couered all his Armour, that the sharpe brystles and tu

Yet resolute for all chaunces, he takes an yron Mace, y• he had brought from the Gyants Castell, & forward goes to the Temple: desiring all his companions, that not one of them shoulde follow him: wherewith Ozalio and Rifarano were somewhat offended, yet lothe to breake his commaundement, they stayed, vsing hartie and zealous inuocations for hys good successe.

And euen as the Bore of Calydonia, that was sent to torment the whole Countrey, died by the valour of Meleager, who afterward made a present of his head to y• fayre Atalanta, as a notable experience of his magnani

Héerewith he gaue the Prince such a cruell blowe, as made him sette one knee to the ground, and so long endured the sharp fight betwéene them: as they bothe béeing farre spent and ouerlaboured, fell downe to the ground not able to styrre themselues.
               
                  Palmendos in short time recouering strength arose, and seeing his enemie was not to be founde: boldly went to enter the Temple, the Gates whereof stoode now wide open▪ which greatlie augmented his desire to enter. Being come within the Porche, two Images of Brasse stoode on eyther side, who with monstrous Trompets blewe such forcible wind on him, as hee was three or foure times carried forth againe therewith: but pressing on still with all the strength hee had, he gotte such sure footing within the Temple, as he felt no more of that violent winde. Passing forward in the bodie of the Church, he came to the magnificent Sepulchre, wherein the Duke of Feria and the high Preestes Daughter were interred, which was so riche,

sumptuous and rarelie inuented, as he had neuer séene the like before. Hauing read the Epitaph, he espied ye Sword, wherewith the most perfect Damosell in looue slewe herselfe, then mounting on the bars that inuironed y• Tombe, he tooke the Sworde in his hand, and in remembraunce of the accident, as also for the beautie thereof, hee hunge it at his girdle, determining to take it with him, and so walked higher to find out the Treasure. At length he came to the Sanctuarie, where stoode the auncient costlie Altare for the Sacrifice, hauing thereon an Idoll of massie Gold, vppon the head wher

This was the shaddow and representation of the Priestes Daughter, who after shee had deliuered manie bitter sighes, with a voice hollow and trembling thus spake.

               No sooner had she ended these wordes, but immediatlie they bothe vanished away, wherewith the Prince greatly admiring: was driuen into such a profounde conceit of her rare beautie, as he thought euen there to yéelde vppe his ghost, because hee imagined neuer to haue seene her like. Heerein his iudgment was no whit beguiled, for he did as many young Louers doo, shewe thems

                  lues fauourable Iudges in their own causes. Now enters he into conceit, because the olde woman had taken her away, that this Damosell was Francelina, she whom he had so liuelie imprinted in his hart, as for her loue he had left his natiue

Ah cruell enemie, why didst thou robbe mine eyes so soone of their vnspeakeable content? thou sufferedst me to see, that my loue might growe the more immesurable: but thy wordes were such daggers to my hart, as neuer can I taste a sharper corasiue. And if this were the obiect of Francelina, (for fayrer creature did the Sunne neuer shine vpon) at no tume shall my soule enioy rest, till once more I haue seene her againe. Thus entercoursing a thousand opinions, he stoode a long time as driuen to the Antipodes, accusing himselfe with base pusillanimitie, and blaming the olde woman, who had so robbed him of his forces, as he could not stay the Lady with him, by whose presence and gracious speeches he supposed himselfe in an eternall beatitude.

The charge of this message we vndertooke, in y• our selues with diuers other Knights, were deliuered from the cruell bondage of Baledon, the Gyant in the Isle of Delphos, where we endured miseries not fit to be recounted in this gracious assemblie. Yet y• heauens gaue Palmendos power to kill this Tirant, after which victorie hee hath seazed the Island subiect to your Maiestie, vntill you sende some such Gouernour or Lieutenaunt as best liketh you: wherwithall, as testimonie of his honourable victorie, hee hath sent ye the Wife and Daughter to the Gyant, to dispose of them as shall seeme best in your wisedome: heere to be added the whole discourse of the Temple, & howe Palmendos had ended the enchaunted aduenture therof.

               A Moore borne as I thinke, aunswered Rifarano, notwithstanding he well vnderstandeth this language: and such is his braue constitution of bodie, as I thinke a more gallant Gentleman was neuer seene. But may it please your Maiestie to sende for the Wife of Baledon and her Daughter, as also the rich present abyding in your Porte? The Emperour requiting them with manie thankes, sent for the prisoners to be brought on land, commaunding the two Princes to bee vnarmed, and sent them two costlie

               I thinke this Booke can bée opened by none other, then him onelie that conquered it, let it therefore bee carefullie kept till his comming. Nowe call I to minde the Damosels wordes, that departed so suddainlie without aunswer: and verilie I am perswaded this Knight is the man shee spake of, who hath sent vs this Treasure from the Isle of Delphos. With these spéeches of the Emperour, diuers of his Knights grew somewhat offended, to heare such commendation passe on him who was vnknowne: wherefore they intended if euer he came thether, to make such proofe of his valour and prowesse, as the Emperour shoulde perceiue he spake but by affection. Not long after, his Maiesty sent one of his cheefe Knights to Delphos, and with him such a trayne as beséemed the expedition, there to sée all thinges ordered to his highnes vse, and to preuent insurrections if anie were like to grow, giuing y• Knight charge if he found Palmendos there, to request him with al spéede to visite the Emperour.

               And hartilie sorrie am I, aunswered Palmendos, that I cannot be present in so woorthy an assemblie: whereof at this time you may well excuse mee, not doubting but I shall come with some sufficient amends for my stay. These speeches he vttered, his thoughts beeing farre otherwise, for so soone as he heard of the Ioustes at Constantinople, he determined to goe thether secretlie, without making himselfe known to anie, but as a strange Knight to aduenture his fortune among other: wherefore he departed from Abenunco, who offered him manie riche presents for hys great kindnes, yet woulde not hee accept of anie. Abenunco returned him manie thankes, cheefelie for hys promise, that hee woulde in shorte time visite the Emperour in personne: so after many courteous speeches, and sundry familliar farewelles, Palmendos commaunded his Pilot to launche into the high Seas, for that he intended an other kind of course.

In this ioy they sayled till they came to Constantinople, where his Maiestie béeing aduertised that the Soldans Sonne was arriued, commaunded Primaleon, Ditreus, and many of hys best Barons to goe conduct him to the Court.

In breefe, thys royall trayne is come to the Temple, and there is the marriage sollemnlie effected, returning to the Pallace with selfesame maiestie they went thether. What should we waste time in speaking of the Feaste, when there is none so simple but considereth, that the Feastes of Emperours exceede common repetition: then may wee repute this sollemnitie aunswerable to that of the Gods, made at y• nuptialles of Peleus with the Goddesse Thetis. After Dinner the Lordes and Ladies fell to dauncing, a fitte occasion sor Louers to commune with theyr Ladies, yet dyssembled

with such cunning modestie, as the eye and action were chéefe messengers of the hart, eche Ladie holding such opinion of her beloued, as their seuerall hope was for the honour of the Tourney.

A while hee stoode regarding the Emperour his Father, so honourably placed with his noble Lordes and Barons on the Scaffoldes: then viewing the Empresse with her gracious traine of Ladies, he wondred at such pompe and magnificence, thus speaking to himselfe.

               Then beholding a Knight readie to encounter him, he brake off his musings, and gaue him so braue a welcome, as he tombled hedlong downe to the ground. Like succcsse had diuers other Knights of the Courte, which Arnedes angerlie séeking to reuenge, accompanied the other in misfortune, and after him Pernedin, Sonne to the Duke of Pera, one of the best estéemed Knights in Greece. Risarano next ranne against Palmendos, and thrée courses they past brauelie with the breake of the Launce, but at the fourth Rifarano was dismounted: whereupon Recinde came to reuenge his Cozin Arnedes foyle, whose fortune was as bad as any of the other, and Lecefin had his disgrace likewise for companie.

Perforce? no, said Palmendos well may I goe with my wil if so be I please. I wish it for your good aunswered Arnedes, and the remembraunce of your valour in the Tourney, causeth mee to beare with you very much: but seeing you will not willinglie yeelde heereto, prouide for y• Combat, and thinke not that your bráuerie at the Tryumphe, shall anie thing auaile yée now in this place.

               So taking his Sword, as well as he might, by reason of his former hurtes, he séekes to defende himselfe and reuenge the Hermits death: but all was in vaine, (for with out a meruailous chaunce) Arnedes death was nowe ordayned. In a happy howre arriued there Pernedin, sonne to the Duke of Pera, one of them that departed in y• search of Palmendos, who knowing both the Combatants, stepped betweene them, saying. Why how now Gentlemen? are courtly freendes become enemies in Field? Arnedes who was no longer able to holde out, falling downe to the earth, sayd.

But Pernedin seeing there was no more helpe, and they likewise ignorant in those kind of vnguents, thought it more meete they should goe straite to the Cittie of Constantinople.

               While the Empresse and her Daughters beguiled the time with him, Amenada a woman Dwarffe that attended on Philocrista, & Risdeno her Nephewe, came to Bruquell Arnedes Dwarffe, who vsed sundry lamentations, for the great mishappe had befallen his Maister. Ameneda comforted him in the best sort she coulde, saying, that in respect his woundes were not mortal, there was no doubt but he would soone recouer them, and the rather, because the Emperour had giuen such charge of him, as his owne person could not be better attended. Ah, quoth Bruquell, would God it were no worse: then breaking forth a renting sigth, be proceeded in this manner.
               Ah my noble Lorde Arnedes, how déere doth her beautie cost thee, for whom thou left'st thy Countrey? where the onelie reputation of thine estate, being extracted from such an high and illustrious linage, was sufficient to haue obtayned her, without hazarding thy life in so man

                  Melicia, who was earnest in affection to knowe more as concerning her louer Recinde, seeing these Myrmedons thus conferring together, and ouer-hearing some of theyr speeches: after they were departed to their Chambers, she demaunded of Amenada, what talk she had with Arnedes Dwarffe? whereupon she repeated the whole dyscourse, to the no little content of Philocrista, because thy

                  ly by her looue to the Prince Recmde, and if perhaps Philocrista should be slow or opinitiue in her loue, Melicia happilie woulde councell her not to refuse so good an offer: in bréefe, that they might reciprocally aduise one another, as sicke folkes who had surfeited bothe of one disease, and so oftentimes it comes to passe, that two thoughts afflicted with one kind of martirdome, receiue together more consolation, then they coulde by anie other that feele not the like torment.
               
                  Bruquell hauing doone his endeuour, for the conciliation of Philocrista with his Maister, returned immediatlie to him, whom he found attending in silent deuotion, to vnderstand the issue of this amorous stratageme, and after that the Dwarffe hadde worde by worde recounted all his negotiation, Arnedes was rapt into such vnspeakeble ioy, as hee imagined the howre happy when he mette with such an ingenious Truch

                  ut séeing what hath happened cannot be preuented: thou shalt then goe to Arnedes, and tell him from me, that I meruaile he would thrust himselfe into so manie perrils, for which I account my selfe beholding to him, and promise in requitall of his hard sufferings, to accept of him as my loyall Husband, if my gracious parents will so permit it: with this condition, that hee aduenture not the least spéeches hereof to me, but hold himselfe suffised by knowing my will héerein. And that I may bee assured of the vehement affection he beareth me, desire him to feede on this aunswere, as on the most soueraigne Balme or perfect Cataplasme, that may soonest of all consolidate his woundes: so hastening his cure and conualescence, that (if it may be) he honour me with his presence to morowe.
               After Philocrista had instructed Amenada in her Embassade, she tooke Melicia aside, to whom (because they loued eche other with sincere

By this time is Amenada come to the French Prince, and hath deliuered the message from Philocrista, wherwith he was so chéerfully animated, as soone after he determined to forsake his bed, but before the Dwarffe returned againe he desired her to conuay a French dittie to her Mistresse, which for her sake he deuised that morning, and withal to intreate the Maister of the Emperours Chappell, to order it in partes after the arte of Mu

               After that Amenada had receiued this Dittie, she saide to the Prince, that shee coulde not tell howe her Mistresse would like of her, bringing her such a presumptuous message: yet if she were displeased therewith, she woulde disguise euery thing so well, as eache of them in the ende should receiue contentment.

                  nest to seeke thine own ruine. And there didst thou finde thy dishonor, aunswered Rifarano, when by force and treason thou abusedst thys Gentleman, who neuer gaue thee any cause of offence: wherefore restore his Wife whome thou vniustlie detaynest, or if reason may not thereto perswade thee, come downe and enter the Combat with me, and I shall let thée know the price of thy villainie. I had not thought, replyed the Knight of the Castell, that thy indiscretion had beene so great, as to thinke I would win a thing so hardlie, and deliuer it from me so lightlie, nor shall the paragon of my hart, bee in the custodie againe of so base an excrement of nature: then spake he to the Dwarffe in this manner.
               Thou wretched and ridiculous creature, commest thou likewise to make one in the Tragedie? begin with thyne owne hand thou wert best, or I shall plague thee with extreame torments. So tooke he the Gentlewoman in hys armes, and oftentimes laciuiously kissed her, shee stryuing in teares to hinder his embracings, wherefore hee sayde. Good Madame, seeke no occasion whereby to offende your selfe, for yee shall sée me plucke downe the brauery of this Knight, and make ye Monster your husbande safe frō troubling you anie more. Tush, these are but wordes, quoth Rifarano, let me sée thee come Armed into the fielde, then shall I liue in hope of some déeds. And if yu wilt haue me imagine thee couragious, bring down the Ladie with thee, that the Conquerer may carrie her whether him pleaseth.

I am content, answered the Knight, because thou shalt see howe little I esteeme thy threatning, and soone shall all controuersies be ended betweene thee and me, that heereafter may arise on this occasion. Quickly had he Armed himselfe and came foorth leading the Lady in his hande: which when the Dwarffe saw, he durst not tary, but gotte him a bowe shoote further off. So fell the Knight and Rifarano to the Combat, which continued long time doubtfull on eyther side, but at length Rifarano had the vpperhand of his enemie, because he had giuen him many cruell woundes on his bodie. When the Squires of the Castell sawe their Maister ouercome, they woulde forcibly haue caryed the Ladie into the Castell again: but Rifarano aduertised thereof by her cry, made them forsake her & runne hastilie into the Castell, then taking her by the hand, sayd. Come with me Ladie, and I shall deliuer ye to your Husbande that loues yee loyallie, as you may be perswaded by this I haue doone at his earnest intreatie. Many humble thankes she requited him withal, seeing her selfe frée from her iniurious enemie, and the Dwarffe séeing this fortunate successe, came and humbled himselfe at the Conquerers feete, embracing his Wife in aboundaunce of ioy, being neither of them able to expresse theyr contentation, for that teares and inward motions of comfort had depriued them of speech. Afterward the Knight had recouered himselfe againe, and came stealing on Rifarano thinking to murder him, but the Dwarffe espying him, cryed out, whereup

The Dwarffe not a little ioyfull for this victorie, desired the Prince that he would accompany him to his Castell, because that trayterous Knight had a Brother and two Cozins, who hearing of his death, wold presently pursue them. Whereto Rifarano courteously condiscended, and mounting the Gentlewoman behind her Husbande, they iourneyed thence with all spéede possible.

But ere they could recouer the place where they wold be, they were pursued by the Knights Brother and his two Cozins.

                  NOt long since you vnderstoode, how after Palmendos had vanquished Arnedes, hee followed his way with long desire to see Carderia, wherfore omitting all occasions that might hinder his voyage, he determined to make no stay till he came to the Isle: and very soone after it was his

chaunce to arriue there, whē he implored the helpe of heauen in fynishing this aduenture, and as a sacrifice after victorie, he promised to offer his soule to the holy caracter of Christianitie, and to be baptized so soone as he could. At this time Belcar kept not the passage of the Bridge, because he was departed certaine dates before, to visite the King and Queene at Macedon: for they hearing of his wonderfull deedes of Armes, in defending that Bridge, fent for him to the Courte by an expresse messenger. And truelie he woulde not haue gone (so resolute was he in his enterprise) but that the Princesse Alderina secreatly commaunded him, by a Letter written with her owne hande: she hauing discouered the trueth of all to the Quéene Griana, intreating her by some meanes to continue the Duke her Father there, till that Belcar came from the Isle of Carderia.

In this, and far greater pompe then I can sette downe, they left the Castell, méeting by the way sundry Knights & Ladies of the Isle, and among them all was an auncient graue Gentleman, Father to the thrée Fairies, whom they inuested in the gouernment of this Isle after their death, he falling on his

So walked they louinglie ouer the Bridge, attended on by manie Lordes, Barons & Ladies, when the Queene séeing her Daughter come towardes her, hardly could she refraine from swouning in the armes of Ozalio, who was likewise readie to doo as much at the ioyfull sight of his Freende Palmendos, yet at length shee embraced her Daughter, saying.

To stay her aunswer, and appease his hote desire, at that very instant the Courrire arriued sent frō

Recinde desirous to win honor by succouring the distressed, and hoping he might find the Knight he sought for at Macedon, answered her in this maner.

thus spake to Recinde. Sée here my Lord, the Knight that slew my Brethren, I beséech yee make him knowe before the King, the teason he committed against harmeles men: for his Maiestie not knowing the enormitie of the case, reputeth this offendour one of the most courteous Knights in his Court, as my selfe perceiued at my last béeing here. Recinde hauing with humble reuerence saluted the King Florendos, turned to Belcar wt these spéeches. Sir Knight, this Damosell hath sworne to mee that yeu haue trayterouslie slaine her two bretheren, after you had béen fréendlie entertained at her fathers house: if yee did so, surelie it was an act far vnbeséeming you, and by force of Armes I shall make ye so to confesse it, if you haue the hardines to enter the field with mee. Belcar greatly offended to heare himselfe so charged, and euermore by one that sought to bring his life in danger, in anger thus replied.
               In sooth Knight, I cannot but think thy discretion very simple, in saying if I haue the hardines to enter y• fielde with thée, and thy presumption is as insolent, as this D

After these spéeches, he went and Armed him selfe for the Combat, which the King many waies laboured to hinder, but Recinde continued so resolutely against Belcar, as the King could not diswade the matter, wherfore he thus spake to Recinde. Séeing you wil not at my intrea tie giue ouer this rashnes, let me vnderstand the name of him that will not graunt so smal a matter, specially to one that is able to yéeld thanks therfore.

                  rof assured, answered the King, that none shal meddle with you but your aduersary onlie: & trust me it greeueth me to the very hart, that comming from the Court of the Emperour Palmerin my Sonne, you should héere enter the fielde against Belcar, who is one of his Maiesties cheefest fauourites. When Recinde heard Belcar named, on the one side it displeased him, y• he was to deale with a Knight so famous and renowned: on the other side it gréeued him as much, when he considered the néere alliaunce betwéene him and Melicia, whom he loued as his verie soule, so that willinglie he would haue forborne the Combat, but that he could not with honor gaine say it.
               Nowe the King desires the Duke of Pontus, and another of his cheefest Barons, to iudge the fight according to conscience, and without any exception of person. Soone after the Champions enter the Listes, where breaking theyr Launces brauelie in the carrire, they were both dismounted, notwithstanding they quicklie recouered themselues, and drawing their Swordes fell to the Combatte. Long while they continued a most furious fight, sharpe & cruell woundes being deliuered on either side, that iudgement could not be giuen who was in greatest daunger: but his Maiestie séeing Belcar were very feeble, and that it was like this

                   ouer the fight. My gracious Lord, answered Recinde, that may we not consent vnto, vnlesse the Damosell that complained of Belcar, will first remit the iniurie he hath doone her. My selfe will thereto perswade her, said the King, in meane while doo you trauaile no further in this controuers

                  e, séeing you haue bothe shewen sufficient and haughtie Chiualrie. So went the King to the Damosell, who was

wonderfull glad to sée Belcar in such daungerous estate, as no Knight before had brought him in the like. Damosel ꝙ he, séeke not the death of two so good Champions as these are, but (for my sake) pardon Belcar if hee haue in ought offended, and I shall cause him to make such amendes, as your selfe shall like well thereof: beside, such courtesy shal ye find at my hand, as happilie shal yéeld occasiō of thanks while yee liue. Héereto will I neuer consent though I die, quoth she, and more wold the present death of Belcar content me, then if the whole Monarchie of y• world were vnder my puissaunce: considering the enorme and dete

The King with great instance intreated her againe, and so did all the Lords attending on him: but all was in vaine, shee was so resolutly grounded in her wickednes, as shee accounted it pleasure to be selfewilled therein. Wherupon, the Quéene (hartily sorie to sée Belcar so sore wounded) vnderstanding the obstinate refusall of the Damosell: she accompanied with the Duchesse of Pontus, and the Princesse Alderina her Daughter, came altogether and desired her, to discharge her Knight of his promise, and the Qu

But these prayers and requests nothing auailed, to mooue any pittie in this inexorable Damosell, which the Quéene perceiuing, and that she continned so obstinate in crueltie: she made a sollemne othe, that if she did not presently pardon the two Knights, (hearing a murmuring among the people, how her accusations against Belcar, were false and flaunderous) that her selfe should die a most shamefull death. The Damosel séeing the Queene so displeased, was affraid of her cause, and beside she greeued to beholde the teares of faire Alderina, wherfore she alighted from her Palfray, and falling at the Quéenes féete, desired her not to regard her great errour of ingratitude, which she had shewed to y• King her husband,

Meane while the Page curteously tooke his leaue, & entering the town,

               Me thinks this is verie straunge, replied Iffida, that this Knight should come from farre Countries to sée me, and verie ingratefull might I be reputed, if I shoulde not thanke him for so great paines: therefore faile not but shewe me him to morrow, so soone as hee dooth enter the Listes, that I may giue good héede to his behauiour. Herein, (quoth the Page) wil I accomplishe your commaund, because right well I know him by his rich Armour, as also the lustie Courser hee rode on yester day. Thus made the Page a train for loue, which afterward reached to the heart of his Mistresse, where hauing kindled the fire her selfe, shee felt the sparkes so to leape about her imaginations, as all this night she could enioy no rest, for thinking on the Knight that came from far Countries.

                  How Palmendos came to the Tourney appointed for Iffida, where he wonne her by his Knightly chiualry, and by that occasion obtained her loue. And how they spake together by the meanes of their Ambassadour, so that Palmendos and Ozalio easilie entred the Castell of Albayzo.

                  mph: Iffida decked her selfe in moste sumptuous ornaments, and after dinner came with the Bride and diuers other Ladies, to the Scaffoldes and Pauilions prepared for them in the field. Thē assembled the Knightes on all sides, and entered the Lists ech one to shewe his prowesse, but because the greater part were on the Bridegroomes side, therefore the contrarye went apace to wracke, and the other were verily iudged to beare the Prize out of the fielde, if Palmendos and Ozalio had not suddainlie arriued. For they knew better how to handle their weapons, then the Knightes of this Countrey did, and that they made them verie well perceiue, thieflie Palmendos who did marueilous exployts, as Iffida (without any instruction of her Page) knew well inough the man that sent her the message, whereat both she and al the beholders were amazed, to sée him so play the Deuil among the Knights, as no one dealt with him but was vnhorssed. When they saw there was no more worke to doo, they with-drewe themselues into their Tent, and would not vnarme them selues, least some treacherie should bee practised against them, as oftentimes at such occasions it

happeneth, when the vanquished attempt vnhonourablie against the Conquerours. When Ripole saw his Knights so discomfited, he was excéedinglie agréeued therewith, because he entirely loued his Sister Iffida, and doubted shee would now conuict him of great dishonour: but shee whose minde was no where el

               These verses fixed on the wall by the Squire, hee ran hastily and caught vp a Sword from one of the slaine Knightes, and setting the point thereof against his heart, said. If you (Madame) by my meanes haue receiued this harde fortune, reason requires that for your sake I should endure asmuch: and with these wordes hee fell vpon the Sworde.
               This was the second act of the tragicall comedie begun at Prissa, & thus after cōtinued in the Theater of Albayzo, where all they of the Castell miserably ended their liues, except thrée or foure Damoseiles, and their waiting women: who likewise were so amazed at this lamentable spectacle, as they thought them selues halfe depriued of life. Palmendos béeing stricken in a dump by these accidents, stood a good while not able to speake a word: which his Cosin Ozalio perceiuing, and marueiling at his alteration, he came and comforted him in this sort. My Lord, you must now abandon all dumpish musing, and reioyce for your good successe in this attempt: neuer trouble your thoughts with other imaginations, but let vs determine our departure hence, before the matter bee further manifested, otherwise we may fall in daunger a hundred times more to be feared, then were we enclosed in the inextricable Labyrinth.
               Your reason is good, Cosin, 
                     •…
                  aunswered Palmendos, wherfore presently we will go séeke for the prison: wherin my Lord the King hath béene kept so long: After they had searched a good while in vaine, at length they found him

in a stong Tower, bound with huge barres of yron, he being so leane, wrinckled, pale and w
                     •…
                  n, as they marueiled to sée him so withered away.
               
                  Palmendos beholding him in this gréeuous plight, remembring this was the father to his best beloued Francelina, compassion caused the teares to trickle down hys chéekes: but the King not perceiuing this humanitie, rather amazed to sée their Swordes so bloodie, thought they were come to end his miserable & distressed life, wherfore he willingly prepared himselfe therto, saying. Soueraign redéemer of humain nature, to thée I commend my soule, which must now leaue this loathsome prison, be thou then my intercessour to thy mercifull Father, hauing so paciently for my sinnes suffered punishment in this wretched place. And séeing hee• hath reputed my bodie vnworthy longer being in this life, be thou my gracious mediatour for my soule, that in his iudgement it bee not bannished from eternall felicitie promised to the good.
               This prayer hauing stopt the passage of Palmendos spéech, Ozalio vsed these wordes to the King. My Lord, bee not dismayed, wée come not hither to offer yee anie outrage, but to deliuer you from this thraldome, and cary yee with vs to Constantinople: where you shall finde your Queene and faire Daughter Francelina, by whose means your troubles haue nowe taken end, and there they stay
                     •…
                   onely for your comming.
               Afterward he declared the whole successe of the action, and breaking the barres of the little wicket, tooke him foorth of that darke prison, wherein hee had remained twentie yéeres, such marueilous hatred did the great Turke beare him. Yet could hee not bee certainelye resolued of his libertie, till hee sawe the Captaine and the rest that were slaine, when embracing the Knightes, hee thanked GOD and them for his happie deliuerance.
               
                  Palmendos thought it necessary to make no longer stay

Her name was Marencida, eldest daughter to ye great Turke, and wife to the King Ocurites of Culaquin, whom Palmendos found néere the Gulfe of Tanais & Meotides: she nowe iournying to recreate herselfe with her Mother, at a fayre Castell not farre from this place, whether she went three daies before in great anger from the Courte, because the great Turke loued another of his concubines better then her. Marencida mourning for the taking of the King her Husband, craued leaue of the great Turke her father, that she might goe visite her Mother for seauen or eight daies, where with her she might beare a share of her greefe and heauines: so parting from the Courte honourably accompanied, and alighting at this pleasant bower to refeshe her selfe, because the night suddainly preuented her, shee commaunded the Groomes to prepare her bed for that night in the Arbour, her Ladies, Gentlewomen and Guard, béeing all there about her. Palmendos hauing charmed with his Sword all her attendants a sleepe, approched néere the beddes side, when the Princesse thinking on her Husbands imprisonment, gaue many gréeuous sighes from the depth of her hart, cursing the Knight that took

Wherfore seeing all her Guarde soundly sléeping, he folded down

the bed clothes, and because the precious Calamite in hys Sword, by nature draweth the body of man or woman to it, as the Adamant dooth the yron: the Ladie presently arose into his Armes, so béeing kept a sleepe by his enchanted Sworde, lay as quiet in his armes, as fayre Daphne did with Phaebus, when Iupi

Alas where am I? what? haue I no one about me that I know? how came I so strangely into this place? why Fortune? hast thou not yet afflicted me enough? are my starres grown into such hatred towarde mee, as in my sleepe to seeke my destruction?

And long time continued he sad & mellanchollie, thinking hee had reciued wonderfull dishonour by the losse of his Daughter Marencida: nor shold he euer recouer the same, til Greece were beaten flat to the grounde, and the Emperour Palmerin with all his kindred vtterly destroyed: where in these ragings we wil leaue him, and returne to our purpose.

                  Howe Palmendos with his company arriued at Constantinople, where the Emperour came & receiued them at the Porte. VV hat speeches hee had with the Queene Marencida, after they were come to the Pallace, howe ioyfully likewise the Queene of Thessalie and Francelina her daughter, welcommed home the King her father.
               
               
                  THe Marriners chéerefully hoysing their sailes, left the coaste of Turkie and launched into the maine Sea, hauing the winde and weather so fauourable, as without anie impeachmēt they attained y•

               Dread Lord, I am the seruaunt and freend to the noble Palmendos, whose renowne hath héeretofore béen blazed in this Court, and he humblie intreateth your highnes by mee, that you woulde entertaine the King of Thessalie, whom he hath brought from Turkie, with such grace and honour as beséemeth his dignitie. By this time I thinke they are entred the Hauen, in that they were not farre off

when I left them, I beeing sent before to acquaint your Maiestie heerewith. The Emperour excéeding ioyfull at these newes, rose and embraced Ozalio very graciou

Behold my good Lorde, your Queene and Daughter, who are ioyfullie come to salute your arriuall: but when he looked on Francelina, the whole quire of heauen was present in his thoughts. The Queene ver

Are ye (my Lord) the king of Thessalie, for whom my hart hath suffered excéeding greefe? I praie ye resolue me presentlie, without holding me in longer suspence, in that your deformed estate hath greatlie peruerted my remembraunce.
               Madame, aunswered the King, it is no meruel though you know me not, considering the long time since ye sawe me last, which the integrity of our loue hath made vs imagine of greater compasse, although the accustomed reuolution of yéeres, neither deminish or increase one moment in their naturall course: notwithstanding, I am the same King your Husband, who haue felt more passions for your absence, then anguish or torment in my miserable captiuitie. But seeing the immortall bountie hath suffered mee once againe to sée you, before my foule forsake this passible bodie, which was my continuall desire during my tribulation,

               My noble Brother, heauen haue the honour for deliuering ye from our common enemie, where albeit I was heeretofore glad of your reskewe, yet was I agreeued at your imprisonment, béeing then my selfe (as you know) in the Turkes power, although hee gaue mee more libertie then you, in hope I would haue ayded him with my vttermost abilitie: my desire then to get from his seruice, constrayned me to deale somewhat hardlie against you, an errour too notable, and I confesse worthy reprehension: but God pardoning the offences of the repentaunt, hath in pittie regarded vs both, and by his inexpuisable goodnes, directed all thinges to a happy ende.

               These newes so greeued Marencida to the harte, when she heard the Emperour say, that the King her husbande and shee herselfe were taken bothe captiue by one Knight, as frantick-like shee coulde haue eaten her fleshe with anger, but the young Princesse Philocrista conducting her to her Chamber, appeased her furie with diuers freendly speeches and curteous behauiour. But let vs nowe returne againe to the Prince Palmendos, who in this time vnarmed himselfe, that the Emperour might at more pleasure beholde him.

Knowe then mightie Emperour, that I am Sonne to the Quéene of Tharsus, the affectionate seruant and vowed friend to your Maiestie, forsaking my Countrey by a strange occasion, so soone as I vnderstoode where my father remained, which long before was concealed from me.

To this he added the discourse of the olde woman, that appeared to him in the Pallace at Tharsus, and how she blamed

When the Emperour heard these thinges, hee presently iudged Palmendos to be his Sonne, by the suddaine and summarie supputation he made of his age, and of the time he was in Pasmeria, where the Quéene his mother came subtilly acquainted with him▪ Bashful her of he was when he looked on the Empresse, as his vermilion colour plainly discouered, yet did he discréetly shadowe the same: notwithstanding, the Empresse misdoubted somewhat, remembring her dreame of the Quéene of Tharsus, and what the Emperour himselfe had told her before, yet made she no shew of any such matter, wisely gouerning her thoughtes from outward suspition, whereupon the Emperour thus began againe.

With these wordes the Emperour tooke him by the hand, going with him presently to the Empresse Chamber, and after his Maiestie had kindly kissed her, hee entered into these spéeches.
               I know well Madame, that héertofore you haue held good opinion of my loyaltie, and that I euer loued you entirely, as your selfe could desire no better proofe thereof: but the cause why I vse these wordes at this instant, is a little scruple that long since entered my minde, and I fear wil offend yee when the same is knowen. Yet least further doubtes should trouble your thoughtes, I protest before him who is the only searcher of hearts, and I sweare by all the diuine assistaunts about his tribunall, that neuer with my will and knowledge did I contaminate our wedlocke-bedde, much lesse haue I infringed the lawes of mariage, or polluted the inuiolable faith I solemnely gaue yée.
               Notwithstanding such hath béen my former fortune, that another woman beside your selfe, by charmes obtayned what was your right, then must you not (Madame) be so seuere and rigorous, as not to pardon mee, séeing I haue voluntarily confessed mine offence, beside, the fault not procéeding from me, deliuers my cause to be more innocent.

                  Here is occasion offered mee of large discourse, concerning the seuerall salutations of the courtly personages, so soon as these news happened in their ears, how the Lords and knightes came to gratulate this newcome sonne, and the Ladies likewise striuing to excel them in curtesie: but it were needlesse labour, considering the King and Quéen of Thessalie concerne this present occasion, and with their daughters ioy vnite them altogeather, preparing for the religious obseruations, to bee vsed on the morrowe at the christning of Palmendos.
