For the whiche bothe the disciple and the maister shall suffre, and doth daylye. It is also necessarye for a gouernour to vse them in faire speche, and set to well theyr wordes with good aduysement without stamerynge.

For if thou learne pure and clene doctrine in youth, thou shalt powre out plenty of good and pure waters in thine age: & yf any strife or debate be amōg them at night, charitably cal thē to gether, and with wordes or stripes make thē al to agre in one.
