            To the Reader.
            
               GEntle if you be, be you so gentle Reader, you shal vnderstand, that I know not whē, there came a Post I know not whence, was going I know not whither, and carryed I knowe not what: But in his way I knowe not how, it was his happe with lacke of heed, to let fall a Packet of Idle Papers; the superscription whereof, beeing onely to him that findes it, beeing my fortune to light on it, seeing no greater stile in the direction, fell to opening of the enclosure, in which I founde diuers Letters written, to whom, or from whom, I could not learne. Now for the Contents of the Circumstances, when you haue red them, iudge of them: and as you like them, regard them. And for my selfe, if I heare you like well of them, when I meet next with the Poste, it may be I will cast about with him for more of them: till then, fearing to be too tedious in this Letter, lest you like the worse of that which followeth: I rest as I haue reason.
            
               Your louing friend, Nicho. Breton.

                  KInde Francke, I haue receiued thy friendly Letter, and note thy carefull loue: but pardon me, if I do not answere thee to thy liking: Alas, how can he truly iudge of life, that neuer kindly was in loue? or know how soundly to help a sorrow, that neuer inwardly felt it? reading makes a scholler by rule, and obseruation I know doth much in the perfecting of Art, but experience is that which toucheth knowledge to the quicke; My mistresse beautie was no Moone shine, whose vertue gaue light to the harts eye, nor her wisdom, an ordinary wit, which put reason to his perfect vnderstanding: and for her Graces, are they not written among the vertuous? Thou sai
                     •
                  st well, she was too heauēly a creature to make her habitatiō on this earth, & is it not then a kind of hell, to be without her in the world? Imaginations are no dreames, where substances are the obiects of the sences, while the eye of memorie, is neuer weary of seeing. Oh honest Francke, thinke thou hast not liued, that hast not loued, nor canst liue in this world to haue such a loue to die in: It is a dull spirit that is fed with obliuion, and a dead sence, that hath no feeling of loue: thinke therefore what was, is with me: and my selfe as nothing, without the enioying of that something, which was to me as all in all. Is not the presence of an Angell, able to rauish the sight of a man? And is not the light of Beautie the life of loue? Leaue then to burthen me with imperfections in my sorrow for her want, whose presence was my paradise, and whose absence, my world

                  o Francke, let it suffice, though I loue thee, I cannot

forget her: and though I liue with thee, yet will I die for her: haue patience then with my passion, till time better temper my affection, in which most diuoted to thee of any man liuing, til I let thee, which shall be as shortly as I well can, I rest.

               A Letter of aduise to a yong Courtier.
               My good Cousen, I heare you are of late growne a great Courtier, I wish you much grace, and the continuing of your best comfort: but for that your yeares haue not had time to see much, and your kindnesse may hap to be abused, let me intreat you a little now and then to looke to that which I tell you: Keep your purse warily, and your credit charily, your reputation valiantly, and your honor carefully: for your friends, as you finde them, vse them: for your enemies, feare them not, but looke to them: for your loue, let it be secret in the bestowing, and discreet in the placing: for, if fansie be a wanton, wit will be a foole: Scorne not Ladies, for they are worthy to be loued: but make not loue to many, left thou be beloued of none: if thou hast a fauour, be not proud of thy fortune, but thinke it discretion, to conceale a contentment: goe neat, but not gaie, left it argue lightnesse, and take heed of lauish expence, left it begger thy state: play little, and loose not much, vse exercise, but make no toyle of a pleasure: Reade much, but dull not thy braine, and conferre but with the wise, so shalt thou get vnderstanding. Pride is a kinde of coynesse, which is a little too womannish, and common familiaritie, is too neare the Clowne for a Courtier: but carry thy selfe euen, that thou maist fall on neither side: so wil the wise commend thee, and the better sort affect thee: but let me not be tedious, left it may perhaps offend thee: and therfore as I liue, let it suffice I loue thee, And so wishing thee as much good, as thou canst wish to be wished, in praier for thy health, and hope of thy happines, to my vttermost power, I rest, in affectionate good will.
               
                  Thine euer assured: H. L.

               SWéete Cousen, I thinke you haue either some Court in the Country, or else you are much studied in the Courtier, that you can set downe such rules, as are no lesse worthy the reading, then obseruing: beleeue me, they shall be my best leizures studies, and in my daily courses my counsellors, my solicitors in loue, and my Judges in honor, my guiders in greatest hopes, and my admonitions in greatest dangers: for your paines in them, I thank you, and for your kindnesse, I loue you: your care of me, I see by them, and wil not vnkindly forget them. I must confesse, I finde Courtiers close people, and Ladies strange creatures, and loue so idle an humor, that I am afraide to loose time in it: but the better by your aduise I hope to carry a hand ouer it. For apparel, I wil keepe my stint, and care for no fond fashion: and for exercise, nature is so giuen to ease, that good qualities are almost cut of vse: and for vertue, poore Lady, she is scarce able to liue with her pension: but for study, I haue litle time, so much company withdraweth me

               GOod brother, the misery of my home life, the crosnesse of my cruell fortune, and the vnkindnes of my vnnatural kin, haue made me so weary of this world, that I long for nothing but my latest houre, and yet loth to dispaire of Gods mercies, willing, to take any good course for my commoditie, I haue of late bin perswaded

by some of experience in their trauailes into those parts, that my trauaile into the lowe Countries would be much to my commoditie, as wel for my language as my skil in such traffique, as I wold make vse of in those places: but my state being so down the wind, that I know not how to get vp the weather, hauing no stock to laie out, to giue me hope to bring in, I wil euen set vp my rest vpon my resolution o

And thus agreeued to charge you, neuer more meaning to trouble you: beseeching God to enable me to requite you, in the true loue of a naturall brother: I rest.

But my state much inferior to my wil, makes me vnable to satisfie your expectatiō: & yet wil I hurt my self, rather then you should perish: for you shal receiue by this bearer, what I am able, and more, as I shalbe better able.

that God, who hath tried thée with calamities, may blesse thée with eternall comforts. In hope whereof, willing in all I can to helpe thée, praying hartily for thee, with my vnfained hearts loue vnto thee, to the Lord of heauen I leaue thee.

               DEare sister, I heard lately of your husbands departure for the Indies, when with no little sorrow I considered your heauie case: in which, finding his wants to be grieuous, and your friends colde in comfort, I could not chuse, without unkindnesse, but remember these fewe lines of my loue unto you: I knowe your state is weake, how faire so euer you make your weather; but the more is your patience worthy honour, that can so nobly conceale your discontentments; for my selfe, I would I were able to doo you good, but what I haue, or can procure, shall not faile to doo you pleasure: but if your minde be too great to stoupe, to be beholding, what I am able to doo, take a dutie in my brothers loue: good sister therefore be of good cheare, and put your care upon me, I will soe you often, and loue you euer: for a creature of your worthinesse is seldome found in your sere: that for her husbands loue will aduenture the state of her liuing: your children are not many, but such as are shall be mine, and you to me as myselfe: take therefore as litle thought, and as much comfort as you can, no doubt but God that trieth his seruants, will blesse them: hope then of my brothers happie returne, and fill he come, commaund me, shortly God willing you shall see mee, in the meane time let me entreat you kindly to accept this little token of my greater loue, which is but an assurance of a beginning of my affections neuer ending, in which predicament of true friendship, I rest euer assured.

                  , and malice in age so malicious, that vertue is so hid vp in corners, that there is little or nothing spoken of her account. For the man of the Moone, I leaue him to waite on the Sunne, but if he haue a mind to any Starre, I leaue him to follow his owlight: for his watery element, since it is all in cloudes, let it hang in the Ayre, I will not meddle with his louing Astronomy. For Connies, I am no Warrener, and therefore let them that haue the keeping of the groundes, looke to their game: I haue small sport in such idlenesse: but for a peece of mutton, a young lambe is worth fiue old Connies, and he that is not glad of such a feast, let him fast for his dinner.

               A Letter of Newes.
               TO performe my promise in my last Letter, my kinde, and best Couzen, you shall vnderstand, of such occurrents, as I heare goe currant for truth: I heare there are certaine olde people, that speake much of Prophecies, where they set it down
                     •
                   for a certaine rule, that this yeare, and many to come, he that wants mony in his purse, and a friend in the Court, may walke into the Country, and picke strawes for his comfort: for the lawe

is verie daungerous for begging, and Charitie is so cold, that the poore must starue, rather then the rich will want. Old men shall neuer be young againe in this world, and beautie in a young woman, will not let her know her selfe. Honestie without wit, will die on the foole, and craft without credit, will labour to little purpose. In summe, there will be a great plague among the poore with lacke of mony, among fooles for lacke of wit, and knaues, for lacke of honestie: but it may be, Nature may alter her course in many things, and Prophecies may fall out in contrarieties. Howsoeuer it be, welcome that comes on Gods name: and so, hoping thou louest no legerdemaine, nor wil

               The Answere.
               SUch idle Prophets as you méete with, haue such kind of matter as you write of: but let the world wagge as it list, there is not a truer wagge in the worlde then thy selfe: and were it not, that I feare my Letter would come to light, I would answer you in your kinde. But to be short, let me tell you, that lawes are good to take order with such outlawes, as after prodigalitie, put themselues vpon Charitie. And yet to crosse your rule of little experience, old men may haue young humors, faire wenches, put wise men to their wittes, and honestie, may thriue with a mean trade, when a craftie knaue may loose by his c

                  ing broking. As for the plague, I feare me it is neuer from you: for if neighbors agree, yet their wiues may fall out: and while the poore fret, and the riche frowne, there is little hope of health, where the world is so out of quiet. And therefore hoping that you haue wit inough, to beware the knaue and the foole, and to make your choise of best company: wishing your continuance of your good humor, with thankes for your waggish Letter, I rest, in our old league.

And so sorie to haue lost so much time to write to you, I wish all the world that knowes you, to hate you.

               HOw straungely men will write, that impatience doth put out of order? a good turne is lost, when it is cast in the receiuers teethe: and abuse misconceiued, can hardly be well excused: consider better of what is done, then wrong the meaning of a good minde, and you shall finde without excuse, no true cause of displeasure: If the information of malice haue moued choller without iudgement, poore men must endure the misery of euill fortune: against my selfe I wil confesse nothing, but referre time to decide all doubts, when Truth shall put the differences betwixt a shadow and a better substance. So leauing ill humors to like mindes, and good thoughts to better natures, hoping to finde you your selfe, which wil be farre inough from that you write: In spight of the diuel I commit you to God: and so rest.
