                     THis Manuscript falling into my hand, for the deserving esteeme of the Author, whose name it bore, I communicated it to the serious perusall of sundrie judicious Censors, who highly approved the curious conceit and invention of the Author: who composed it (as hee hath since ingenuously acknowledged) in his infancie of judgement, which made him altogether averse from publishing it. Howsoever the subject seeme light, you shall finde it like a delightfull soile, so plenteously interveined with pregnant passages, pleasant allusions, liberall and unforc'd relations, as I make little doubt, but it will afford a pleasing relish to any ones palate, who through Criticisme of censure is not prejudicate. Read, reape, and returne.

                     SOme few yeares agoe, one Boraccio Fumiganto, a Burmudan, made repaire unto me; and upon discourse of the plantation of Tobacco, entreated mee upon all termes of love and familiarity betwixt us, that I would addresse my pen to treat of that Subject; being, as

                     e verie truly affirmed, a principall help to discourse, especially to our young English Gallants, whose first salutation to their acquaintance is, Will you take a pipe of Tobacco? But my answer was no lesse roughly than roundly returned, replying, that Alexander Severus would have smoaked such sellers of smoake, and Xerxes would have pulled their skin over their eares; if these smoakie Merchants, being such as this Burmudan was, had vended, or vented those commodities in their time. With

this answer, my fuming Fumiganto seemed much discōtented, taxing me of prejudicacie, in condemning a Science (for so this Factor termed it) which was not onely hugg'd but honoured by our hopefull Gentrie; whose desire was rather to be matriculated in the exquisite taking of a Pipe, than in the tossing of a Pike; in a quiffe and a quaffe, than shaking of a staffe. Presently upon this affront, came in a Trinidadan with a Varinan, who desi ou

                      to heare what Subject it was that made us so hot, I replyed, it was Tobacco, the verie fume whereof, as it doth ever, had driven us to that distemper. O insolence, or rather impudence, quoth the Trinidadan! shall a weed, the wealth of many Ilands, and the delight of the Queene of Ilands, receive that aspersion? tellme, tellme (quoth hee) thou profest Mamothrept to all generous humours, how should long and lingri

some Companies be maintained, if this soveraigne receipt to all maladies, were not countenanced? What Companies, said I? Marrie the Company of Pipemakers, Sirrah Stoicke; whereof one Brachifort, who is no small Foole, hath procured a benefit, to inhance the rints of his pate by the rents of the pipe, and smoake them who made Pipes for others smoake. Is it possible, quoth I? Yes, my cringing Criticke (said the Varinan) that it is, and yet you disesteeme our qualitie. Besides, I heare, quoth hee, that one Aestivus Nepenthiacus, a grand Monopolist, and a judicious Practist in his profession, hath of late renounced his practice, wherein hee was a right hopefull beginner, to betake himselfe to the plantation of Tobacco; wherein I will not justifie his triall of experiments, being for the most part more deceiving than thriving; but sure I am hi

                     , and other artfull inventions, have prov'd him a Dogmaticall Doctor in his profession. Whereto I answered, that indeed I had heard of his rare experiments, but how little Nepenthiacus had gained by them, might appeare by this, that as he

had formerly left his Profession, so now of late he was enforced to leave his nation, to worke wonders among the wilde Irish. Where report was, hee intended to remaine till he had reduced all those bogs and marishes to plots of Tobacco; so beneficiall is he to the State, though prejudiciall to himselfe. This, quoth the Trinidadan, may bee all easily done, if he exactly observe his geometricall ascents & descents, which by his mathematicall line, which hee hath alwayes in readinesse, with all facilitie may bee attained. For in that glorie of Ilands, wherein I have long time remained, works of greater difficultie than this have beene effected: but to insist on any of these I will not, because they would seeme incredible to the shallow and barraine apprehension of the vulgar: yet to make instance of one for all, I hold it not altogether fruitlesse. I have seene the seeds of Tobacco sowne in a bed of gourds, and in a moneths space the whole bed of gourds were into leaves of Tobacco changed. Where at smiling, I have read (quoth I) all Ovids Metamorphosis, and I finde there no such transmutation. No marvell (answered he) those were fictions,

these true and native relations: besides, you are to know that Travellers in their surveyes, assume a priviledge above the authoritie of Authors. Traversing thus our ground, as one cloyed with this discourse, I had a desire to leave them to themselves, and addresse my selfe to mine owne affaires; but Boraccio Fumiganto, my familiar friend, and one who had more interest in mee than the other two, st

                     ee and the doore, conjuring me upon that inviolable league of amitie so long professed & protested, that I would rest satisfied by giving way to their entreatie; promising withall, that my travell should not be unrequited, if I would prosecute some thing touching the praise-worthy invention of Tobacco, which they with such importunitie desired: But modestly, as seemed me, did I answer: that my labours, as they deserved no such courtesie, so did I ever scorne they should bee mercenarie: besides, if I should give way to their request by publishing ought concerning the singular use of that commoditie, yet might my Taske seeme uselesse, the oyle of my Lamp fruitlesse, being employed in that Subject so much pressed, so frequently

printed, and therefore needlesse. Whereat the Varinan seemed much incensed, vowing, that many yeares were not past since hee first set foot in this Ile, how then could it appeare that any Author would doe him that favour, being no English-borne but a stranger, to undertake for the vent of his commoditie any labour? To which objection I replyed, that the English were ever courteous unto strangers, many times approving better of them, than of their owne naturall inhabitants. And whereas, he could not be induced to beleeve that any Author would addresse his pen to write in his favour: I assured him, that I had read the Titles of divers bookes treating of the use and commerce of Tobacco; as the Poem of that English Musaeus, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , Tobacco battered. Likewise, another pleasant poeticall Paradox in the praise of the P. wherein is learnedly proved, and by impregnable reasons evinced, that Tobacco is the onely soveraigne experimentall cure, not onely for the Neapolitan itch, but generally for all maladies incident to mans bodie. Which discourse is with no lesse exactnesse prosecuted, than Rodolphus Agricola's
                     
was in his tract of the Vanitie of knowledge; Cornelius Agrippa in his discourse of the Uncertaintie of knowledge; or Erasmus in his so much admired Encomion in the Praise of folly. Besides many other judicious relations of late yeares published by our English Navigators, all tending to the praise of that excellent knowledge in the plantation of Tobacco: and those exquisite effects which in forraine countries it hath effected. So as the Herbe Moli, so highly prized and praised by Homer, could not bee more usefull to the wandring Ithacus, in repelling the charmes of Circe, than this Indian weed hath beene ever by their reports powerfull to the travelling Arabs, to inure them to all extremitie. What then should Tasks of this nature be any more revived, seeing so generous and generall an use of it hath made it approved? so as, whoseever should write against it, might have more adversaries to oppose him; than he had reasons through his whole discourse to alledge for him. Yea but, replyed the Trinidadan, for all this, it is not unknowne how the Emperour Eudorus hath divers times inhibited this to all

his Courtiers: yea, and long since, so bitterly inveyed against the humorous and phantasticke use thereof▪ as publikely all those great Professours, who formerly did partake of nature with the S

me with new reasons to undertake the defence of their Trade, objecting, how by mine owne mouth they would condemnè me, if they could not now at last after many perswasions; prevaile with me. For (said they) you confesse the Citie, Court, Countrey: Yea, the Treasurie of all knowledge, even the Academies affect, it, and will you in a Stoicke reluctancie oppose it? Besides this, you have sundrie affectionate Allies, all Agents of happie employment and hopefull improvement, who since their plantation in Tortouga have dealt in this commoditie, to their profit and succeeding memorie, which may bee an irresistable motive to induce it. To which powerfull objections I a little relented, yet so, as I expressely told them, I would not much insist upon their conveniencies or inconveniencies of their trade, being of late time inured to dangerous sophistication, having knowne by report of an experienced Chymicke, divers ounces of Quick-silver extracted from one pound of Tobacco: but to discourse of the Life and Death of Tobacco; as first of his birth and education; secondly of his Planting and Propagation, I

                     IN Tartarie (I reade) not farre from the Burmudoes, there dwelt a rich Hander, whose name was Nepenthes: enricht he was with all the best of temporall fortunes; and to make his blessings more consummate, with a chaste and continent wife, called Vsque

a more soveraigne power: hee tasted (one distaste) in the overflow of his fortunes, which was, want of children. Much he had, and great possessions was he master of: but who should be his heire he knew not, being bereft (of that onely one of humane blessings, hope of issue. Long had he now lived with his vertuous wife, when behold he was made happy in hope, though the event answered not his expectation so fully as hee imagined, and thus it fell out. These two good Inhabitants dwelling neere to the sea, they used now and then to walke upon the sea shoare, not onely to refresh themselves with the coole temperature of the aire, but in meere compassion to entertaine (such shipwrack't soules as destitute of hope or meanes, were throwen upon that coast▪ it chanced that an Apothecary of the Burmudoes, (intending to goe into Hoemonia where the best and soveraignest herbes, plants, soots, and Aromotaries are said to be) he was intercepted by Pirots, who rifling him of that poore estate hee had, threw him over ship-boord: but see what refuge

he found in the ocean? The Polype fish (which naturally loveth sweet savours, & is exceedingly delighted with perfumes or any fragrant smell, taking this Apothecary in her nose, presently approches him, and swallowes him (for he was but a little dapper knave) quite downe. The poore Apothecary thus imprisoned, yet not quite bereft of sense, but to know where he was, remembers himself, recollects his spirits, & with an expert and successive hand, tries this conclusion; he called

                     o mind how he had some purging Comsits about him, for (he being costive in his body, used them upon all occasions:) these he ministers to the fish, which she no sooner had received, then, as the Scolopendra is said to avoyd her very entrals, till she has rid her selfe of the hooke, so she purged backeward and forward: sicke she was, and heart-sick of the Apothecarie, and in great extremity, till delivered of him: for any mā may judge, if one pill had such extreme force, what force was he of that ministred these pils? Not farre from the banke side, was this poore Apothecary set at liberty: when behold,

he begins now to wrastle with a second death: the billowes of the sea menacing ruine; the whirlepits gaping to devour him; little hope or none is left him; for there's no Purge in all his Boxes will save him. The poore man thus distressed, though to dye hardly resolved, yet he sees no remedy, to die he must be enforced; and surely had dyed, if thse two compassionate Ilanders, that ever were prest and addrest to pitty others miseries, had not rescued him. A little Cock-boat being tied to the shoare-side, (though unfit to endure any rough tempest,) Nepenthes unlooseth and in meere compassion (though in this adventure he hazzarded himselfe, and was much disswaded by his wife to the contrary) yet sets he forth towards him, and by the sudden calmnesse of the tempests intimating, that the gods themselves were pleased with a worke of that merit, he takes him up into his Boat, and brings him with a mutuall joy, in safety to the shoare. The Apothecary as yet amazed with his new-past danger, and as one new come out of a trance, thinking these two Ilanders

had beene Neptune and Tethis his Queene, and no mortall creatures, made this druggary speech unto them following.The Apothecaries speech.
                  
                  BRAVE and puissant Neptune, and you sacred Queene of the nine Iles, Lady maioresse of the great Ocean, Governesse of the lower Elements, Commandresse of all the skaly generation, from the Sea-horse to the Seamouse, Umpiresse of all differences in this watery region, &c: may a poore ship-wrackt Pothecarie speake to your Excellence? one that hath ministred Triackles, Antidotes, Receits & Cordials to all (or most of your Patients) within your flourishing Iles of the Burmudoes; and now is enforced (like a poore supplicant) al Drugs of Rheubarbe, Carduus sanctus, Coloquintida, Artemisia, Oenanthe, and what herbes or plants soever were preservative against the Scotoma, Oedema, Lithiasis, Paralysis, Celphalgia, Lycanthropia; all diseases, Ulcers, Morbs or Contagions wheresoever or howsoever arising, all these (I say) set aside, I am now enforced to crave pardon at your Highnesse feet. With this: the

two Ilanders interrupted him, demanding the reason why hee should pardon? O (replied the Apothecary) I see the judgements of Neptune be now (and not without cause) powred upon me; oft have I (and with watery eyes I speake i
                        •…
                     ) ministred instead of purging materials, such as were binding: This, this, (and with that he beat his brest exceedingly) have my false Drugs brought me to: I have oft times ministred for potions, poysons to torment my Patients; that I might increase my estate by their infirmities: I never consulted with my Doctor for my Patients health, but how to augment my wealth, by his lingring sicknesse. Punish me therefore Great Neptune, throw me into the Sea, that I may poyson as many fish as I have poysoned men. Nepenthes willing to waine him from this strange distraction, bad him be comforted, and with this serious speech shewed him his errours.
                  MY FRIEND, as thou ascribest, the cause of thy present misery, to thy forepast impiety, and as thou wishest Neptune might censure-thee according: o

thy demerits, having deserved the worst of men: so I would have thee know I am neither Neptune that can or will censure, nor shee Tethis that should shew thee rigour; Two Ilanders we are that will shew thee our best of welcome, and hospitality shall be the worst punishment we will inflict upon thee: onely, as thou ex: pressest thy owne sorrow for the contempt of thy profession: redeeme the time thou hast lost, and retire with us; if we can yeeld thee comfort use us: for never past misery by this shore unpitied, if we could either remedy it, or redresse it. With great thankes went the Apothecary along with them to a neighbour Grange adjoyning, where with all curtesie he was entertained. It chanced one day, that Usquebaughin sitting discontentedly in her Garden, began to expostulate the cause of her barrennesse, and thus (though hervertues never before so farre transgressed their limits, or lesse expressed themselves) she proceeded.
                  Wretched Vsquebaughin, what crime hast thou committed, what offence hast thou done, or what worke of

hospitality hast thou omitted: That thou (and that onely thou) shouldst be deprived of that commune bounty of Nature? Others have flourishing issues; and though their estates be lesse, yet they know, who shall possesse them: But I (that have no issue, bereft of the greatest of comforts, what avayleth it me to possesse abundance, when all this shall succeed to a doubtfull heire? yet is my griefe enlarged! who will not judge how Nepenthes got it? that hath no issue to whom he may leave it; sure (will some imagine) extortion hath been the meanes of his raising, which makes his house so quickly declining. True, true, (unhappy woman) many such surmises will arise from thy barrennesse: though thy husbands vertues be never so transparant. I will retire my selfe therefore to some desolate place, that as, I am deprived of comfort, I may be deprived of light; nor would I have an imputation aspersed on my husbands honour, through my defect. Whilst she was descanting thus her own griefes silently, that the silence of the place and privacie of her passions

might augment them: Cantharides (for so was the Apothecarie called) came into the garden, where seeing this disconsolate woman (all a mort) wiping her teare-swolne-eyes, to minister no lesse solace in her afflictions, than she had done before to his, he thus with milde aspect, and compassionate respect, spake unto her.
                  IF griefes be best allayed when communicated, or afflictions best eased, when they find partners: be not such an enemie to your selfe (sweet Mistris) as so to engrosse your owne passions to your selfe, as to shrowd them from others. Nor indeed can griefes be concealed. The face is the best Secretary of the heart; and will expresse in silence, what passions move disturbance. But it may be, you wish one of more secrecie to impart your woes unto; of secrecie you cannot, of discipline you may. And though judgment wanteth yet shall secrecy and fidelity supply the place, where more serious advice cannot instruct: Suspect me you need not, for my life is due unto you; and let this protestation serve for confirmance: when I cease to be yours, I will cease to be mine owne.
                  
                     The Gentle woman seeing the character of a good Nature in his ill face, and one that seemed willing to requite so inestimable a benefit as hee had received, subjecting and consecrating his life where it was due: apprehended this occasion of delivering her surcharged brest, recalling to mind how by his profession, there might be some cure to the cause of her griefe. Guest (for so I will be bold to call you:) I know sorrowes are best allayed when imparted, if hope of remedy, or least appearance of release be expressed: But so farre is the nature of my sore above the search or reach of cure, that in expressing them I seeme to augment them, because the opening of my malady, will instantly minister despaire of remedy: yet to satisfie your desire (that generally our hospitality may afford content) I will describe my griefes, though by the relation I expect no ease. Know (my friend) that many yeares have my husband and I lived together, without least difference or debate betweene us: and in that prosperity and happines of estate (if happines can consist in having

sufficient) as we have not only a competency in our selves, but have expressed and extended our bounties unto others: Yet in this seeming Beatitude, in this height of riches (know my friend) that we are made miserable, yea, in our riches despicable; the cause is drawne from our want of issue, which you know (if ever experience gave you that comfort) to be the principall motive of true content; ministring best solace to the parents griefes; yea, and reviveing their memory, whē raked up in the ashes of oblivion. Alas sir, what be these faire buildings, flourishing Medes, spacious Downes, which you see wee are here possessed of? they must of necessity succeed to some, and it may be to some base Tartarian, that will raze and deface the memory of our providence, with his security, riot, and superfl
                        •…
                     ous expence. And what shall remaine of us? scarce so much as that we were; But why doe I beat the aire, with a vaine repetition of misery? You have heard sir the occasion of my griefe, the motive of my discontent; and I know you imagine it to bee

above the compasse of remedy, let it be sufficient that I have satisfied you, that can satisfie my selfe in nothing save griefe.
                  This discourse the Apothecary attentively observed: oftimes lifting up his hands to heaven, thanking the powers divine, that they had ministred him so ample and expedite an occasion, both of shewing argument of his thankfulnesse, and meanes to release this disconsolate woman of her pensivenesse. For this Cantharides was excellent for many Cures, but for none so famous as for sterility or barrennesse: for which exquisite Art and knowledge, hee was famous through all the Burmudoes Ilands: so that as no place was then more savage, so no Region or Countrey had more fruitfull women in it. Thus therfore, as soone as she had expressed the cause of her discontent, with cheerful countenance he thus addressed his speech;
                  I HOPE (faire Mistris) this present occasion of your grieving shall be (ere long) the motivest cause of your joying: there is no cloud but it presages a following cleerenesse, no

                        panthos, in the Morning, send forth gusts from the North, in the Evening, calmes from the West. This I speake (Gentle woman) to expresse the limit of your griefe extended, the web of your passions contracted, and now your calme approching, after so many billowes over-flowing. The cause of your griefe I know to be moving: for all creatures have, and doe repose their greatest joy in their progeny: Priam and his miserable Hecuba before the ruine and

desolation of that great and populous Citie, which indured so many sieges ere it was sacked, were esteemed happy in all things, yet the complement of their happinesse consisted in their faire and flourishing issues. Herotinus had as much Temporall felicity, as humane debility could attaine unto, yet the extent of that felicity summ'd up it selfe in his 600 sonnes. And true it is you say, that the posterity gives life to the deceased parent; for as long as their issue surviveth, their image seemes revived, and Nature seemes to proportion a second selfe in the child, being cast in the mould of the Parent. But whence this discourse! in expressing comforts of this nature, and not ministring to your discomfort, I seeme to imitate a rigorous and remorselesse Physician, who before hee gives his Patienta Cordiall, applies unto him extreamest Corasives. I am heartily glad (Gentle woman) I am arrived here for your sake, and if divine powers, (as sure they have) may bee thought to have a hand in mens preservation, for a more excellent end or purpose, sure that Aesculapius (which

And whence proceeded this, but from Ioves too much lenitie?

But see what just judgement he (in his powerfull Majestie) denounced on so impudent and ingratefull a Villaine: in stead of loving, he is now rolling, and must so perpetually, the wheele of eternall anguish: Blessed prevention!

                  After the perusall of this letter, you may imagine what cold swounds came over poore Pluto's heart: so as in the increase of his distractions, and decrease of his comforts, which he imagined matchlesse, by the new birth of his supposed heire: in the retirednesse of his passions (which seeme most bitter when most retired) hee thus conferred with himselfe; expostulating the probabilities of these suspects, with the sinceritie of his approved and ever trustie friend Mercurie; of whose undoubted fidelitie hee made no question: yet because the longrooted

conceit of Proserpina's constancie, and her generall respect to honour ingendred in him a doubtfulnesse how to resolve: yet in the end Mercuries information is preferred before his first resolution. The divers enforcive causes whereof may appeare more amply in this private discourse to himselfe.

                         ordinarie neither, for it seemes it is confirmed by the generall rumour of the Gods. Why then Pluto (to make the conclusion agree with the premises) thou art a Cuckold: and that bladder-fac'd, goggle-ey'd, rheumaticke Rascall, Bacchus, has been penning a set speech in Proserpina's Note-booke. VVhat remedy? I shall bee set in blacke and white for it: to bee the first Prince of hell that ever bore horne for his crest, and mine impresse shall bee about it, Inopem me copia fecit; no rather, Haec sunt insignia Bacchi. Miserable Pluto. canst thou descant of thine owne shame without blushing? to have thy

Gem soiled by a Canker-worme? a mop-fac'd Rogue, that seldome or never lyes in sheets, but makes the Taverne his lodging chamber, and the bulke his pillow. O inconstant Proserpina, to chuse a lowsie Knave, base in education, grosser in conversation, and odious to all but Flemmish Brittons! Could none satisfie thee (unsatiate Messalina) but the dregs of pollution, and that never made difference twixt lust and love? How thine eyes were dazled? How farre thou disparagedst thy judgement? Couldst thou see any such excellencie in Bacchus, or any one good condition to approve thy choyce? Was hee so farre above thy Pluto, as thou preferredst him before thy Pluto? Blush at thine impudence: Or if Bacchus grape have taken so deepe a tincture in thy blushlesse face, as thou canst not expresse thy shame by the outward character of a blush, at least send out a relenting teare, and that perhaps will mollifie the heart of thy abused husband. To whom should I appeale to? If to mine owne Judges, I shall rumour mine owne shame in Hell, as it is dispersed

already in Heaven. If I appeale to Earth, that rancorous Troope of incarnate Devils will answer mee, it is ordinarie with them to have Cuckolds, and they never enacted Law against that Veniall Errour. To bee briefe, they will absolutely conclude they have no Law for it. If I appeale to my father Iove, and present a bill of complaint to the Senate of Heaven against mine owne wife, I shall bee but laught at, and the cause will be protracted, and my selfe the while eternally tormented with delay of revenge: But what bids Mercurie mee doe? Play Tereus part, cut out her tongue, and she will not blab my dishonour: That were a ready way; and yet hardly were that course secure either; a woman will make a shift to speake, if her tongue be cut out: there is no hope in so desperate a cure. Come, come, I have it: hang laughter: Am I a proclaimed Cuckold, and therfore a complete honest man, and will not I seeke remedy for mine imputation? Is it not a reproach for Pluto, to bee termed a Wittall, a plaine honest wellmeaning Cuckold? By my regiment

Shew remorse on me, and inflict revenge (thou Tonitruous Iupiter) upon this Horne-maker: for if thou doe not: Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo.

And that the Bastard (as an apparant and evident note of his dishonour, continues in the Court of Hell, to a publike contumelie of the said Pluto, and no lesse griefe to us. We therefore, to root out the very memory of such disgrace, and the being of so worthy an issue: doe in our power transforme the said Bastard (in resembrance of Aca

a Plant; wch, to expresse his father shall still reserve the name of his progenitor Bacchus: and therefore have we in his memory, called him (as one commended to the care, protection, and tuition of his father) Tobacco, the curse whereof we referre to the consideration of our sonne Pluto, whose injuries we in compassion feele in our selfe. And that our decree is not to be abbrogated nor disanulled; We have here in our celestiall Consistory, Sealed it with the subscription of our glorious Synode subsined, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Neptune, Aeolus▪ &c. Our decree is not to be adjorned, but with expedition confirmed. For Proserpina, to pray is bootlesse; prayers are out of season; or to weepe and deplore her present misery, is fruitlesse; teares cannot move remorse. The Decree must be performed, and so it was: for Medusa, that brave inchantresse, is sent for according to Ioves Decree: and she with her Snaky-rod catching the child, with the Decree read over it, transformes it presently.

one no lesse (if not more) inexcusable than the other; returnes their child againe with a sumptuous Armolet about the Arme of it, to recompence the wrong she had done, with advantage. VVhat joy the Parents conceived at the restitution of their child, I leave it to you to imagine: Meane time, we will proceed with the second branch of our discourse, to wit, the blessing (or cursing rather) which Pluto gave this Bastard Plant, foretelling, with what admiration it would be received on earth.
                     Novv my brave Bastard, I will send you up wrapt in a Paper to that father of yours, Bacchus, and may my blessing follow thee. Thou art now to travell through many straits: first through the noses of the Burmudoes; for there it is fit thou offer thy selfe first, because they challenge an interest in thee by thy birth. Thou shalt be hissed out of the schoole of Hypocrates, Aesculapius, and Galen. Not a Quack-salver Doctor upon the Universe, but shall reade Lectures on thee, as if it were upon an Anatomy. The mercinary Pedler shall counterfeat

thee: and drying some VValnut leaves, shall forsweare himselfe for thee. The Frenchman shall love thee, for thou art restorative to his infirmities; thou shalt be as familiar with the tatterd Indian; as Slapdragons with the Flemming; Potatoes with the Italian: or Flawnes with the Bohemian. Thou shalt be thy fathers Caterer, provide him victuall and victualers to 
                           〈◊〉
                         his victuall. Yet my comfort is, thou shalt not be onely for the generous Gallant, but as well also for Aminadab the Pedant, and Hob-nayle the Pesant: The very Tinker (with his fine Brasse) shall tinckle on thy sides, and snuffe thee out like Neesing-powder. The Pox and Piles shall reverence thee: one fire strikes out another; and whole families shall maintaine their Tatterdemallions with hanging thee out in a string. But of all Cities, Iles, Provinces, Dominions, or Segniories, none shall entertaine thee in that royalty, or with that generall state at the Albionacts: their Long Acres, Uplands and Downe-lands shall flie in a trice to retaine thee in their company; Thou

shalt soake them to the bone (my renowned Bastard) and make them skarre-Crowes to Nature. Yet, it cheeres my heart, when I thinke how every foole must have his Bable; and not a good discourse without the suggestion of thy brave, pregnant and fiery spirit. Yet, as well as they love thee, they'l spurt thee out, and make thy owne Mansion all be slubberd with thy owne Iuyce; while this raiseth Pluto one pin higher: to see a yong Cavalero spit out his patrimony in Rhume. No entertainment without thee; nor speech worth observing, that has not life from thee. Thou makesh the pursued Roarer forget the Serjeant is at doore to arrest him. Thou makest him valiant: not a Brasse button on the Universe dare attach him. Who dare encounter Phaeton, that is nought but fire and smoake! Sending out the Tapers of his wrath, the fagots of his indignation? The Cressets of his spleene, and the furnaces of his evaporated Ire at the Crevisses of his Nose? Why, I shall be made to blesse thee: Thou wilt be the onely enlarger of my kingdome, the

enricher of my state▪ and the stablisher of my Empire eternally. I shall thanke my wife (ere long) for my Bastard honours. Never did Al

I see Charons boat over-burdened already: hoyse up sayles Charon, my hony Bastard sends thee them in Swoupes. But I see more vertue in them yet; as the light of the fire darkens the light of the candle, so shall thy smoake (the pure Elixir of a Gallants brain-pan) draw to thee all the smoake that's used to steme out of great mens Kitchins: Their habitations shall become as desolate as a Wildernesse; as bare as trees in fall o'th' leafe; as naked as a Frenchmans Scalpe; and as destitute of hospitality, as a Wappin Broker of honesty.
                     But this is nothing to that reverence those smoaking Albyonacts will do unto thee: there will a Scholler make a set speech to thee; and canvase thee in a Blanket, with predicamentall words, above comparison or Gradation. VVith, O thou Hyble of Intelligence; thou Ars

Thus will the word-joyning Scholler grace thee. Then the Lawyer with his Quillets and mentall reservations, Solecysims, VVrits, and Demurres without Demurres, will thus aboord thee.

Atlanticke, brought such rich booties to their mother Cleona, what will my transformed Bastard doe for me, that hath the whole world to rome in? Thou wilt make Bacchus call thee his white boy; and I will crowne thee with a Diadem of burnisht gold; with a plume of Estrich feathers: and thou at thy returne, like another Aquila, Affricane, or Pompey, shalt triumph in the streets of Hell; we are as many Trophies, as thou hast enricht the Treasurie of Hell with soules. Heere shalt thou lead the Prodigall in chains, and with a shadow of smoake, draw him to follow thee, aut sequetur, aut trahetur. Here, my brave Spend-times, shall desire thy company; but thou like a triumphant Hannibal, shalt contemne them, leading the Slaves in bonds; and like another Tamerlane, make Earths Soveraignes follow thy Charriot wheeles, crouching like pedestals at the foot of thy Majesty. Hear my Cautions therefore; and in observing them, thou shalt purchase thee a wreath of eternall honour: Not a Fiend but shall bend to thee; and thou in the Majestie of thy state shalt contemne

the greatest, being made miserable by thine inchantments.
                  
                  
                     Especiall advertisements given by Pluto to Tobacco.
                     
                     
                        FIRST caution I propound, is, that in everie place where thou commest, thou take the best Booth in the Faire. Plant thy selfe in the eye of the Citie: set mee the picture of some sallow-faced Blackamoore, or a Virginia-man, for that will rather draw custome upon the Frontespice of thy doore: A Zeuxes or Apelles would doe well in these cases, to enforce passengers by the picture, to draw neere the substance: make a partition in thy shop; it may bee the hot Venetian comes to bathe with thee, rather than to drinke Tobacco with thee. Draw the curtaine close (sinne would have no eyes poring upon her) and when thou seest a young raw Novice, that never was

yet matriculated in the schoole of vanitie, make a speech to him in commendation of thy vertue, power, and operation; if hee listen thee with a greedy eare, continue thy discourse with arguments, and how insufficient soever, no matter, the Gudgeon will be taken, and having him once in, presume on his custome. Now and then to discourse of novelties, and unheardof rarities, will not a little encrease custome: for the phantasticknesse of the age admires nothing so much as fabulous relations. Tell of thy strange birth, but neither of mee nor of the place of thy birth: though men come so frequently to me, yet they love not to heare of me: I would have thee in any case lay traines for the better sort, for the worser sort love to imitate the better: And then in thy profession thou maiest apologize thine errours (as thou canst hardly bee without them) if thou meane to live rich, or not to die a Beggar.
                     THERE bee three persons I would have thee use with all observances, the Scholler, the Lawyer, and the Poet; I distinguish them, for seldome makes

Poet Lawyer, seldome becomes Lawyer Scholler, seldome exquisite Scholler either Poet or Lawyer. The Scholler to confirme thy profession by reason, the Lawyer by equivocation, and the Poet by invention: One to discusse, another to discourse, and the third to fable These, as by time observing, they may bee eternally won; so by scurvie usage they may bee eternally lost. The Scholler will bee thine, if thou talke in his element; sooth him in his arguments; and call him most profound, dogmaticall, and literate Trismegistus: let not one reason (though it be never so wide of sense) passe from him without thine approbation; and when thou art wearie in praising his imperfections, fall to admiration; but let it be,—Ut pueri Iunonis Ave
                              •…
                           . If thou canst know what Universitie he is of, advance it with new-coyned and strangely-minted Hyperboles: Discourse a whole houre of the antiquities of the place; not Mount Pernassus it selfe more ancient. Then dispatiate into the pleasantnesse of the seat; the fruitfulnesse of the place; and withall,

of the greatnesse of their Commons; for that they like to heare of, though they seldome see it. These discourses will make the Scholler thine owne; he is thine individuate and incorporate friend; the Ivie claspeth not neerer the Vine, nor the Missell-tow the Oake, than he will knit to thee.
                     THE Lawyer will be thine, if thou compare these present times with those flourishing and impartiall dayes of Hortensius, Marcus Appius, Cornelius Graccus: swearing too (for thou must make no bones of oathes) that for pure eloquence, excellent conveyance, absolutenesse of method, and other proprieties, Rome in her glorie (even in the maturitie of her time) never attained so absolute and exact a course in pleading. Then in defence of corruption, (because everie man must live by his trade) talke of brave Senatours, and the bravest Councellours, would now and then be anoynted. and for unction dispense with conscience; and tell him withall, examples of authoritie to confirme it. This discourse will so ensnare my young Mowter, as no question (if hee distaste

smoake) hee will frequent thee for thy many good parts: An oyly tongue (my nimble Bastard) is worth a kingdome.
                     FOR the Poet, I cannot tell what to say to it, he is so oft out of his wits, as he verily imagines himselfe the man in the Moone: There's quick-silver in his braine; and if he were not now and then encountred by Sergeants, and kept under locke and key, hee would verily turne Bedlame. Yet because phrensie must bee purged, and thou (my Wag-halter) hast vertue and operation to love such, becken to the thred-bare contemned Urchin, give him a pipe on my score, hee'll pay it at the next new play he makes, if the Doore-keepers will bee true to him: and if not, hee'll make thee up some scurvie end of a Ballad, deserves a pipe of smoake. But before thou humour him, I would have thee finde him, and I protest to thee I cannot direct thee to him: many have this name, but as farre different from the perfect straine of a Poet, as the glistering of the Gloworme from the light and splendour of the Sunne. Some come from the camp to the stage, from the pike to the

pen; and few Souldiers will prove good Poets. For the nature of these men (I my selfe have had an itching inclination to this poeticall phrensie) had rather fight with Bacchus than Mars; and had rather cope with a barrell, than oppose themselves to a quarrell. Others, from an Indenture to a Theatre; the Scribe turnes Pharisic; and Asinus ad Lyram, expresseth his owne shame by his Scriveners fragments. Others, from mowting to comicke writing: a brave honour to descend to Poet from Lawyer. But amongst these (my brave Spurio) thou shalt finde many generous wits possest with this phrensie, call them to thee, smoake their wits, it may bee they are mustie, and desire soaking: These poore Gnats deserve thine acquaintance, even the lowest favorite in Parnassus Armourie, Qui nescit versus, tamen audet fingere. Take him to thee, hee shall, for his love to Ribauldrie, drinke a pipe on my score: What, shall vanitie want smoake? No, (my thrice-renowned Hermaphrodite) smoake thou them here on Earth, and I will smoake them in Hell with pipes

of Sulphur. But I pray thee retaine these last of all others; they will draw company to thee; they are made the verie Morio's of our time: and what good wit but either can draw thee into acquaintance with great ones; or is so endeared to the other sex; as by their meanes, thou shalt have creatures of both kindes (and that will make thee for ever) resort to thy shop continually! Humor me these Poets; extoll their devices, though thou never heard of any of them; they love to be tickled: Flatterie they cannot judge of; for they verily imagine their deserts out-strip all commendations. But now (my Rogue in graine) if thou couldst set up a private Refectorie, for the young effeminate sort (for they would like Adamants draw continuall recourse) I would hug thee eternally. Sell mee Potato-roots, Eringoes, all Electuaries, Confections, Receipts, Conceipts, Deceipts, Pomatum, Cerusse, with a large recitall of thy brave commodities; and a little smooth-faced Ganymede standing at the doore, who▪ like another Parret or Mag-pie, may crie ever in one tune:

                        What doe you lacke? Pomatum of the best, Cerusse; what doe you lacke? If thou be so blest, as to get these Syrenfaced things into thy confines, I shall be happie in thee. The best meanes to ensnare them, is to commend them; and in comparison of sexes, to prefer theirs in many degrees before the grosse and distempered constitution of man; fumming up some especiall records of their sexes worth. "Blessed creatures, Soveraignesses of earths happinesses (thus mayst thou binde them to thee;) when Nature framed the best of her Art, shee examplified it in you, making you the founders of Cities and flourishing Countries, Provinces and Ilands.

                     Justice with a sword in her hand portrayed like a woman; Prudence with a glasse; Temperance with a diall; Fortitude with an huge Colossus on her shoulder, that Hercules could not remove: all these in Imbroderies, as Tapistrie, Cloth of Arras, and the like, beare the formes of women.
                     Thus commend them, and they will sooner buy Eringoes of the worst (so they may have them by retaile at thy shop) than at others of the best, that▪ cannot with a glibberie tongue deifie them. But I hold thee all too long: last Caution I should give thee, have I reserved for the last, that it may take deepest and firmest root in thy memorie: on my blessing I warne thee to contemne honestie, as a poore whore that is neither for

Court, Countrey, nor Citie. Spurne at her when shee offers to be acquainted with thee; it is not fit that Pluto's Bastard should respect Honestie. Get and care not how; forsweare thy selfe and thinke not when; cheat, respect not where. Honestie could never thrive in the world; as she is a beggar discard her; as shee is simple scorne her; and as she is base loath her. When shalt thou see Honestie▪ approach a great mans palace, enter a Tradesmans shop, or get bed-roome in an Inne? but Knaverie is ever reaping a commoditie: There is not a Comrade in all the Citie, but she can make use on; that wind blowes ill, where she gaines not something. To bee short, ere thou ever set up shop, or hang out thy Blackamoore, disclaime honestie; entertaine perjurie; and the first part of knaverie may begin with a paire of uneven scales. Thus if thou proceed in thy trade, I shall thinke my Cautions well▪ bestowed; if not, to aggravate thy punishment, I will eternally banish thy strumpet-mother from mee; and make those verie Gallants which frequent thy shop, kicke thee into the

kennell for thy honest simplicitie. More should I say unto thee, but that Hell growes turbulent for want of government. Though I doe not leave thee as I found thee, in that thy shape is altered▪ yet I leave thee in some respect better instructed: This is my last blessing; Fly into the world, and may knaverie guide thee, false weights enjoy thee, and many phantasticke Asses be seduced by thee.

I am too old to be a slave to a whoore; too wise to be tempted by a whoore; and too proud to serve a whoore. The wastfull prodigall, that becomes heire of his fathers bagges, but not his vertues, shall not affright me with his oathes; awe me with his screw'd face; or dismay me with his Bilboe blade: I have a weapon of a stronger temper, and it will pierce further then a Roarers Tolado.

                     Yet of all these, none to me so profest enemies as these smokers of our Age; they whiffe me out in fume: and spend my best of houres in Candlelight; their wits goe and come by Pipe and Pipe; thus am I taken in snuffe by every Pesant. Alas (poore aged Time) was thy first race thus addicted? were those ancient Heroes of renowne, which got glory by forraine Conquests, for their Pipe using a Pike, for an herbes vapour, fields terror, thus imployed? No; their time

was spent (and gloriously spent) in their countries renowne; Commonweales successe; or publike managements of state, not in an airie vapour. These increased in generall respect by particular worth; they had other imployments than piping; Belonaes march relished better than the juyce of Necotiana; then were the clattering of Armes, the ranking of battailes, the ranging of souldiers, and marshalling of fields, of more esteeme than smoake. Unworthy successors of so noble and imparalleld predecessors, shall Time be spent in nothing, being the precioust of all things, but in smoake and vapour, the lightest and trivialst of all things?

O Niobe, why weptst thou that thou shouldst be so soone deprived of children, since my greatest misery is derived from having children? Thou weptst, not to possesse them, I to enjoy them; Contemning their foster mother that first nurst them. I tell them, my teares are continuate; my love intimate; and my end approaching; yet they answer me with hearts obdurate; enmitie inveterate; and ends despairing. I offer my selfe, and they spurne at me; wooe them with best of Times rhetoricke, and they despise me; and open the treasures of my heart to them, but they reject them and casheere me. And is not this miserable, to contemne him, casheere him, revile and inveigh against him, without whom they cannot live; without whose breath they cannot grow; and without

whose supportance they cannot stand? What have they wch I give them not, (or within the course of my houres) that I minister not? Puritie of aire, to breathe; variety of sounds, to heare; fragrancy of savours, to smell; qualities and differences of taste, to relish; Diversity of corpulent substance, to handle; and rarities, with dissundred store of varieties, to behold. And doe these bounties deserve no requitall? Doe these gifts merit no recompence? Must these ample and indefinite beauties and bounties receive no thankes? must this

VVell; if this be the fruit of thy long education, the end of my travaile, and the period of my care, I must seeke out some other children, that will imploy their time better, and make use of my bounties with more circumspection.

Remaines there nothing now for all my time of labour

in nurturing them, who have bin odious to that Power from whence I descended? Ungratefull to mee, by whom they were releeved? and worst to themselves, by whom they have perished? I say, remaines there nothing for my labour in nurturing them, but teares of continuate affliction? motives of perpetuate distraction (and remedilesse) being hopelesse of their conversion? I was to them a second Nature, by my nurture pamphering them with my delights; without occasion of surfet; cherishing them with my essentiall Cordials of comfort; and teaching them mannagements of Armes, all oppositions to discomfit; and yet how soone may valour be turn'd to effeminacy, resolution to cowardise, and discreet government (in a hopefull infancie) to a distemporate dyet, by giving the reines of liberty?

Time is a precious jewell that must be sought after, if obtained; feeke after me then, while I may be obtained.

Offer then your first fruits, your first endevours, and first intentions, to the use and service of time; that in the surveigh of your readinesse, he may minister to you with all cheerfulnesse. Beleeve times words! it is not the swarty-chopt Tobaccodrugge, that will yeeld you content in the expence of your time: You may smoake it long ere you better your owne discourse, or make your Accounts even, which Time expects at your hands. A whole ounce of Tobacco will hardly purchase one dram of wit: Repentance is the best fruit you shall reape out of such an unsavory herbe. Art thou yet reclaimed, or art thou hardned? If the one, Time shall entertaine thee with his blessing: if the other; Time will bid thee farewell, but farewell thou canst not; being relinquished, and utterly forsaken by Time. I am yet staying heere in the street for thee: answer mee but

with hope, that thou wilt come, and thou wilt revive poore Time, that droopes with despaire of thy returne. Yet, Spissum verbum est amanti, veniet: I pray thee foreslow not my hopes, frustrate not my expectance, but satisfie my love; Never did pleasures with all their appearance, so much affect thee, nor any temporary delights so well deserve thee: Come then quickly to him that doth both love thee, and hath well deserved thee: Odit, nec patitur moras amor: That love which proceeds from the heart, hates delayes with her hart; but where love is dissembling, there love without offence may be delaying. How long have I observed thee yonder smoaking, and was doubtfull whether thou wert (as thou seemedst) a man, or that Beast, which the naturall Historian talkes off, that sends out nought but fire? In, I durst not come to thee; for I doubted, if I had remembred thee of my abuse, I should have beene spurn'd and spurted at for my labour; Thou art too great to be put in mind of thy errours: but the time will come (Et nesci

when thou wilt wish with briny eyes, relenting heart, and all attendants of a passionate and distracted soule, thou hadst received my instructions, attended to my advertisements, and made Use of my Cautions. I will therefore, with this publicke and irrevocable Edict, summon three maine infringers of my Will, contemners of my selfe, and corrupters of the Age: my summons shall serve for my last warning; if they returne no more to those Stygian-shops; those Cymerian hovels of darkenesse, I will remit their former errours; if (in despite of my summons) they continue in the height of their Flaming vanities, their smoaky Impostures, Time shall whip those three Stygmaticall Catolounes to death, cutting them downe like Mugweedes, with the Sythe of Fate: Those three majesticke Tobacco-nosers, Captaine WHIFFE, Captaine PIPE, and Captaine SNUFFE. And first for Captaine WHIFFE.
                  
                  
                     To Captaine WHIFFE.
                     
                     YOu Captaine, that glory in your Art of vanity, making a high

Road-way 'twixt your mouth and your guttes, (and with a cunning retrait) bringing it backe same way it came; you, that set up bils for your Novice to reade; as thus: Whosoever wil be Disciplined, or Matricula ted in the Art, Science or Mystery of Tobacco-whiffing, let him subscribe his name, the place of his being; and Captaine Whiff: will be ready there to attend his yong master-ships pleasure, with the profoundst of his skil. O my impudent Sharke, Art thou fled from thy Captaine, & dar'st thou now usurpe the name of Valour? Thou: that durst not smell Gunpowder art now turn'd Tobacco-whiffer? For thee, if there were no Time, yet there would remaine some few Minutes reserved, to commend thee to a halter, for thy flight from thy Captaine. I my selfe will present thee for altogether; thou shalt not onely bee hanged (I would have thee marke me) before the eye of the world; but I will have thee begg'd for an Anatomie, that thy Entrals▪ (like Tamerlaines blacke Bannaret) may hang for Tropheyes in honour of Captaine

Whiffe, and his thrice-puissant, and thrice-renowned Profession. Having brought thee to be this Anatomy, I will leave thee.

                     YOu Captaine Pipe (because your name is good) and many Pipes we need in this our flourishing Troynovant, for conveyance of that pure Element water into our Citie. You I say, shall be imployed in conveying of water, (because you have beene ever used by men which frequented those Alleyes) to those despicable and forlorne creatures, those diseased Gally-foists of Turneball, Picke-hatch, Ram-Allie, and other Suburbane-traders, that in contempt of Vertue, make a Contract with Hell. This (though it be no worke of Charity) yet it is as good a worke as is expected of thee Captaine: thou wert once the Gallants Pander, beare now the Whoores Tankard: Where I will leave thee.

                     CAptaine Snuffe, it may bee you will take it in snuffe, if Time tell you wherein you erre: but best is, as I am indifferent for thy hate, I am secure for thy power: Renounce the Devill, (Captaine) be not fired before thy time: be respective (as thou art a Captaine) of thine honour; and take heed thou taste not, for thy Tobacco, Brimstone and Sulphur: I would not have thee snuffe at mine instructions; for I may, and with unamated front must tell thee, that I have contested with a man of as great worth, and of far more grace, it may be. The higher Cedar (if faultie) deserves the rougher censure. Opposition to the malevolent disposition, is my recreation. Now it may bee, that in some drunken passion thou wilt sweare to stab me, what wilt thou gaine by it? where wilt thou bee, when Time has no being? Let not my precepts move thine indignation, but thy conversion: for thy threats, Time never feared them (though spoken by valour) much lesse

by an indiscreet Asse, that is carried away with choler.
                     Now for my Pipe-invective; if it drive thee into a fume, from a fume to a flame, my heart is hoofed; may thy gall with fume bee seared, thy guts with the flame be scorched, my fireworke will bee secured, though with paper-squibs onely sconced.
                     If Time should pray for thee, I thinke thou wouldst not thanke mee; yet I will offer a few orisons up for thee, for I doubt thou canst offer none for thy selfe. Leave me that s

                     In honour, seeke it not; for seldome is honour sought by deserts: if shee may by direct courses bee purchased, & without appearance of thine owne seeking, receive her: Gold should bee taken, if offered. In riches, bee not so prodigall, as thine owne expence may breed want; or so miserable, as thou canst not use thine owne. In life, prepare for death: in time, for eternitie of time; that when thy being is expired here, thou mayest live ever elsewhere. In eminent places, let not the object of Earth darken thine eye for Heaven: for Time had rather bee a poore sojournour twixt Earth and Heaven, than by being great on Earth, lose my portion of greatnesse in Heaven.

Happily are thy desires extended, if thus disposed; and Time, which in thy happy expence of Time did love thee, shall in thy possession of Eternitie, leave thee.

                        The maine stalke of Tobacco groweth upright, and big in proportion, his leaves are velveted, and are in growth bigger and larger at the stalke than towards the end of the leafe; resembling the plaine forme, figure, or feature of any other leafe not ragged nor indented, save that you shall have some leaves broader and larger than both your hands, and in length▪ as

much as three hands breadth.
                        The flower of the Tobacco is much like the flower of Niel; sometimes yellow, and sometimes of a Carnation colour, and sometimes in forme like a Bell.
                        And when it casteth the flower, it leaves the former proportion, & taketh the semblance of an Apple; in which you may find the seeds inclosed very small, appearing not much unlike to Iusquiasme seeds, which are yellowish: but when they grow toward their full ripenesse, then they appeare more near to a blacke.
