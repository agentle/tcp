               HERODOTVS the father of hystoryans wytnessethe, that there is a regyon, adioynynge to the Thraces, inhabyted by certayne people named Trauses: whiche in tymes past were accustomed, that whan a chylde was borne amongest them, incontinently, as it was oute of the mothers wombe, the parentes and neyghbours dyd assemble together, and there receyued hys fourthe comming with cryes, wepynges, and lamentacions, remembrynge howe manye myseryes and calamytes he shulde of necessyte suffre in thys worlde. And to the contrary, when a
                  •
               ye of them departed from thys lyfe vnto death: they accompanyed him to hys graue, in greate festynge and reioysynge: in synging and ioyfully rehersynge the multytude of euyls and tourmentes, frō which he was exempted by death. whiche thynge puttynge in consideration, the Ancyent Grekes vsurped in suche sorte, that Ausonus the Porte made or deuysed a prouerbe, whiche sayd, that it were right good for a man not to be borne, or yf he were borne, to dye ymmedyatly: so narowely loked they vnto the incommodities of mans life. And to saye the trouthe, yf that we would dylygently regarde it, we shulde fynde wyth Plyny: that nature hath dearely and at to hygh a pryce, solde vnto vs, the haboundaunce of thynges, which she bryngeth fourth to oure vse, and that we haue no ioye nor swetenes, that maye not be, sadnes and bytternes, which is indyuidently ioyned vnto them. For besyde the incomparable dangier, that we must passe for to come into thys lyghte, albeit that we be borne to haue lordeshyp and commaundement ouer the other beastes, yet none of them commeth vnto the worlde so vnprouided & yll appoynted, as we do, nor so frayle, weake and passyble as we be. And as the same Authour Plyny in the Prologue of the seuenth boke of hys naturall hystorye more largely and subtelly recyteth, Nature hath geuen to all beastes euen from theyr byrthe, lybertye, vesture, habytacyon and grateful nourriture. But mā alone is he, that assone as he is borne, falleth bare to the grounde, begynneth hys lyfe by beyng bounden or swadled, is constrayned to borowe hys garment of an other, to trauayle hys membres and hys spyryt to buylde hys lodgynge, to get hys foode by sweate of hys bodye and contynuall laboure of hys handes: after the difficultes of hys rysynge vp, and the length of tyme, that he must haue to learne to go and to speake. But yet thys is worse, that where all other beastes, do geue themself by natural instinctyon, to that, which properly appertayneth to thoffyce of theyr nature, thone to flye, thother to swymme: It is man alonly that knoweth nothing withoute teachynge, nether to go, nor speake, neyther to eate, nor fynally to do any thynge, that is in the worlde, without teachyng, excepte it be to wepe. So that thys pytyfull ignoraunce hath geuen place and auctoryte vnto the Prouerbe Italian, whiche sayeth, that a man muste be borne wyse, or els to be borne two tymes. For yf he be borne wyse, he maye escape infynyte inconuenyences, where as

through faulte of experyence, he tombleth dayly duryng the cours of this short lyfe, into greate preiudice of hys wytt. Yf he be borne two tymes, in the seconde lyfe, he maye ayde hym selfe with that, that he shal haue learned in the fyrst and shall not wander in the darknes of erroure, as he is constrayned to do commynge into thys worlde without guyde or lyght of knowledge. Then as it is more necessarye for man to learne, then for any other beastes: and that the conceyuynge of knoweledge, consysteth in the spyryt: It semeth very strange to thinke from whence it maye procede, that (seynge that Nature hath fourmed vs of membres and spyryt, and that the membres mortall and weake, make vs lyke vnto beastes, so much in this more auau
                  •
               taged than we, that the more parte of them be more stronge and myghty, & lesse subiected to dyseases: and y• the spyryt durable and euerlastyng, by the whiche we are parttakers wyth Angels maketh vs excellēt & worthy aboue al other creatures) yet alwayes we seke and take payne to please the body by all meanes possyble (euery man genera
                  •
               ly towarde hym selfe) and that there be not many that passe vpon the spirit, or better to say: there be fewe found ye ones woll regarde it. There is no man of so lowe estate, that he careth not to couerre hys parsone wyth some sorte of clothynge. And the nomber of them is infynyte, that for to geue it more grace & deckynge, be not contended or take it to be suffycyent to be wrappe it in golde, pourple & delicate silkes, except they trauayle straunge countres of the worlde, for to get stoanes, most rare and precyous, and employ them to the curiosite of theyr nyce trymmynge, where maye not a man see that the more parte of men lyuinge, not onely haue not theyr thought vpō true vertue and dutie double rewarded, but also that they kepe it not ones vnder shadowe or coueringe of the lyne or small threde of good conditions? Nowe what shall we saye, that for to sa
                  •
               isfy oure corporall actes, of the earthe, which within fewe yeares must retourne into duste (to the sustenance whereof the thynges present, and that nature doth offre vs in 
                  •
               uerye place, myght suffyce) There are no feldes, no seas, nor forestes, which be not by vs with greate diligence trauersed and serched to thentent, that we maye haue delicious meates and please our sensuall appetytes. That whiche more is, albeit, that for hys commoditie and ease, to defende the sonne, snowe, rayne and iniury of the ayer, one lodgynge or Cabayne well closed myght be ynough, yet we loue better to cause strange marbles to be brought from the furthest regyons of the earthe habytable, for to make, buylde & edifye large and greate pallaces. Where as for the most part, we regarde not wherwith the heauenly part, which is in vs, is repasted and fedde, nor yf his lodgynge be conuenyently prepared: and sonner we set afore it the leues of vyce, thā the moste sauoury and swete fruictes of vertue, holding it more comonly recluded and locked in the obscure and base vsage of sensualytie, then in preferring it, to haunt the clere and hygh operacions of honnestie. Furthermore yf at any tyme we fele any parte of oure body dysordered by sy
                  •
               knes, we seke by all meanes & wayes possyble, for to recouer the health decayed: but we are litle carefull to prouyde recouerey, or to mynystre mete medecyns to oure mynde, beynge euil at ease. Shuld this come paraduenture for this cause? that for so much as the body is sene more then the spryt, we thynke therfore that it hath more nede of suche prouisyons? this argument is not suffycyent, for not onely the bodye hath not more apparance, than the spyryt, but also ye body is by hī greatly e
                  •
               alted in it, and that it be a true spyryt, it hath as many faces, as it sheweth operacyons: and the body neuer sheweth hym selfe, but one fourme, in the which in many yeares he is scarsely seene of many men, where the operatiōs of the

spryt, may be in shorte tyme knowen throughe all the world. And this self body continueth but very fewe dayes, where the spryt, whiche is euerlastynge, abydeth euerlastingely, and may reteigne by him self through many worldes, that, wherin we accustome ourself, duryng the tyme, that he is with the body. To the which thynges and other infynitt, whiche may be alleaged for this purpose, yf men woulde haue suche consideration, as they ought to haue, it woulde cause better lyfe and more increase at this tyme than it dothe, and we hauyng care suffycient for our body (but more garnyshing our thoughtes and myndes, and feding them better, and geuing them more honorable habitacion) shulde be more worthy to haue them, than we be, and shulde take more greate care to conserue them in helthe. And yf peraduenture they chaunced at any tyme to be diseased: we shulde enforce our selfes with moste diligence, to remedy theyr diseases, more then we do. Which be: Arrogance, superfluite, ambition, Couetice, immesurable desyre of lyuinge, and that whiche maketh vs lyke vnto beastes, IGNORANCE, so contagyous, and pestylent in the mynde of man, that it semeth, that all other spyrytuall infyrmytes, whiche trouble him, do all procede from thys alone, for where she is, God is not duely honnored, vyce ys not exchued, nor any publique nor priuate action or offyce, is rightfully & in order admynistred. So that the sentence vsurped by ancyent men, saying: that euery ignorant personne is euyl, hath bene of good right receyued. And to this approueth that, which Terence had no doubte to cause to be spoken by an olde man of experience, that the earthe beareth nothynge worsse, than a ignorant man. For as he is in all thynges rude and vntaught, so in this, he is intollerable: that he thinketh nothing well done, but that, whiche he doth hym self. And truly ignorance is muche vnmete and vnsyttynge in al parsones. but in them of nobilitie muche more reproueable and parnycyous. Who lyke as they surmounte the other in dignite of bloude, Riches, apparayll and auctoryte, so this is theyr greate reproche, yf they do not passe other in excellēcye of knowlaige, that apperteygneth to theyr vocation, extendynge more to the charges and publique administracions, than to a heape of vnprofytable pastymes and exercyses of recreation, wherin they lose a greate parte of theyr tyme, whiche might muche better be employed to learne the rolle of the parsonage, whiche shulde become them to playe in the courte of the common welthe when theyr tourne or course shulde come. The coste shalbe to deere, yf they be forced to become wyse by theyr expences, as to learne in makynge warre. For warre is a thyng to be vtterly exchued, and wysdome is right miserable, that is gotten by vse onely. And it is certaine, that they, whiche lacke prudence and knowlaige, can do no noble actes in tyme of warre nor of peace. Which regarded by Salomon Kyng of Iewry, after that he, which can geue all thynges: had geuen hym chose to deman̄de what he would: he required nothynge, but wysedome. which chaunceth aither by a souueraine priuelege of nature, or ells is obteygned by a great knowlaige of learnyng, ioyned with a naturall wytt, whiche is the rudder of the shyppe. And of such vertue and efficacyte, that by meanes of it, as sayth Cicero, there be founde many great and vertuous personages wythoute learnyng. And the natural man without learning ys more hable to receyue prayseworthynes and vertue, then the learned wythout naturel wytt. And at all tymes, for the good that maye be, to trust in it, and to employe it, without experyence, to take part vpon the multitude of dyuers chaūces, which happenne hourely in thys worlde, is as perilleur, as to say
                  •
               e a voyage withoute any calamyte. For althoughe the shyppe be good and strong, and well garnished and tacled voyth sayle and ballast, yet he, whiche is wythin,

knoweth not at a chaunce what wynde bloweth, nor the Reace, that he oughte to kepe, withoute the compas, by meanes whereof it hath alwayes be sayde, that e
                  •
               peryence is maystres of thynges, teachyng vs to rule and gouerne, in thinges present and to comme, by Iudgement and remembrance of thinges passed.

And albeit, that it were more merytoryous and conuenyent for our helthe, not to haue in all operatyous, but one onely ende, whiche is the last and principall: yet for so muche as that is very harde, & rather a thing Angelicall, than humayne, for to wythdrawe all oure senses of the soule, Ioyned wyth them of the body (whiche be carnall) and to apply them to the same, which be separated from the body, and from earthly thynges, to wyt, to the contemplatyon of thynges spyrytuall: It behoueth vs neuertheles to dyspose and determyne by all meanes to passe quickely by these furste and meane endes, which be worldely, in such sorte, that men forget not the same, which ought to be the laste & principall.

Thinking that I haue done nothyng by the trāslations aforesaid, yf I had not translated thys hystorye, which so greatly is celebrated by all them, whiche haue had knowlayge of the sayd orations & cōcions. And yet for all that, after I had ouerrunne the sayde hystorye, I therin founde so many difficulties, specially in the vnderstandyng of the said orations & concions (whiche haue alwayes seamed right harde to all them that haue redde thē, albeit that they were excellēt in lernyng, as Cicero him self acknowlaigeth) that I purposed to repēt & to withdrawe me frō my enterpryse, & so much the more yt the translatyon, which was made out of Greke by Laurencius Ualle, seamed to me very obscure & hard, & truly so had I done, had not bene M.

And yf I haue accepted it, it hath bene for thys, that it semed vnto me a thyng reprehensible and vnexcusable to resist the commaundement of my Emperour and mayster. whome I knowe to be so wise and so vertuous. And sythens that it hath pleased hym to do me thys honnour (for so woll I take it) to commyt and geue me to subdewe an prouynce, that neuer man enterprysed to assaille, I had rather dye in the poursuyte, than to forsake it throughe fayntnes of harte or dysobedyence. Albeit that I haue bene deceyued of a succoure, to whome I yll trusted. to wyt of the Cardynall of Bizance, at whose persuasyon as I beleue, youe haue commytted thys charge vnto me. Who is, to speake the trouthe, and wythoute flaterye, an excellent Greke amonge the Latyns and an excellent latenist amonge the Grekes. For that, that nowe at the hower, that I hoped that he shulde haue helped me (as he had good knowlayge, and woulde haue done) he is gone for legate vnto Bullonia, wherby I fynd me as despayred of myne enterpryse. not seynge a parsonage that would or might ayde me. By occasyon wherof thou mayest knowe (right reuerende father) that I haue ben in such payne and trauayle, that yf thou wouldest iudge vnto me the triumphe for thys here, as thou haste done to other in lyke case, I shulde not reioyce so muche of the same, as of thys, that I am come to thende or ouercommed my labours. for that, that I founde me many tymes wythout ayde and wythoute compaygnie, in the estate wherin they be, which make mynes in the earth to take a place, or for to fynde the mynes or the vaynes of quarryes, and whan they haue dygged very deape, they se not lowe nor hyghe, farre nor nere any thyng that they searched. Wherfore yf that by these mynes I haue taken the places, yf I haue founde by dyggynge, the vayne of stones of pure

marbill, and of fyne golde (as I thinke I haue done) it is not to marueylle, yf I be right ioyful to be at the ende of my labours. For, for to speake of Thucidides, he is reputed amongest the Grekes, as the Porphir amongest the marbles, or as golde among metals, for that, that there is in hys speakynge, so muche grauitie, so muche vehemencye and so muche trouthe, wythoute glofynge (which is the pryncypall part in an hystorian) that they, whiche rede it, thinke and beleue that that he wryteth, holye to be true, and that he hym selfe that hath wrytton the hystorye, hath not onely sene the thynges, wherof he speaketh, but also was therin presydent or ch

               ef. As he was for trouth in many thynges, so as shall appeare hereafter by the dyscours of the hystorye, albeit that he was charged to haue to slackely comme to succoure by sea, the cytye of Antypolys wyth the armye by sea, wherof he had charge. By occasyon wherof he was bannyshed, although vnryghtuously. Duryng whiche banyshment, he composed thys present hystorye, and yet coulde not fynysh it as he had determyned, bryng preuented by death. And yet neuertheles thys present anthor and Herodotus haue the prayse amonge the Grekyshe hystoryans, all lyke as Saluste and Titus Lyuius amonge the Latynes. For the one of them, to wytte Herodotus, goeth forwarde all playne and easy wythout any roughnes, as a ryuer, that ronneth swetely all hole together wythoute any sourge and wythout wawes. The other, to wyt Thucydides, hath hys course more impetuous and in speakyng of thynges of warre, semeth that he is at the poynte of doynge it, and that he geueth tokenne to fyght. As Quyntilian the greate Oratour sayeth in thys manner. Many haue wryttone hystoryes very elegantlye, but no man putteth me in doubte, that there a

               ne not two, that greatly exceade the other. And albeit y• theyr vertue and excellencye be in dyuers qualyties, yet the prayse is egall, asmuch to the one, as to the other. To wytt, Thucidides, whiche is briefe and compendyous wythout interuption, and Herodotus, who is eloquent and copyous. The one is more vehemente for to moue mens hartes, the other more remys and gentle, thone is more singulier in hys orations, and the other in hys speakynge. The one is more lyuely, and the other more playsante. Thowe haste than (right reuerende father) by the testimonye of Latynes, what the hystorye of Thucydides in Greke is. And yf thou dyddest thinke, that it hath all the same mai

            ☞In thys furste Chapter the Author, for to shewe, that the warre, wherof he woll speake, hath bene more greate, than any of the other that the Grekes had euer hadde wythin theyr countreye or wythoute: reherceth the begynnynge and procedynge of the countreye of Grece and of all the landes, that they had hadde before thys presente warre nowe moued.
            
               The furste Chapter.
               THucidides Athenyan hath writt one the warre, whiche the Peloponesians hadde wyth the Athenyans from begynnynge of the same vnto the ende. hopynge that men shall fynde it right great and more worthy of memory, than all thother, that haue bene before. By meanes that bothe partyes were than very puissant and plentyfull of al thinges necessarye to maigteyne it. And also for that, that all the residue of Grece did entermedle on the one syde and on the other. Some of them from the beginning and other after the consultacyon. and thys motion of warre was very greate, not of Grekes onely, but also of straungers, and by a manner to saye, of manye dyuers natyons. And albeit that of other warres, whiche were before thys, and chiefly of the more auncyent, there is no greate remembraunce nor certaintie: yet alwayes I esteme by dyuers coniectures, that I haue of manye thynges whiche I haue diligentlye inquyred, that they were not verye greate. nother cō
                  cernynge feates of warre, nother as touchynge other thyuges. For that, that it is suerlye certayne, that the countrey, that nowe is named Grece, was not in tymes paste so establyshed & permanent as it nowis. But the inhabytantes therof were oftentymes dryuen awaye by other more puissante, and wente to dwelle in other places. And by thys meane, they had not amonge them any trade of marchaundyse, nor any entrecourse by sea nor by lande, but all in feare. And for thys cause they tylled not theyr lande
                     •
                   but onely so muche as was necessary for theyr lyuyng. Also they hadde not than greate plenty of monney, nother dyd they plāt many trees in theyr lande, for that they were not very certaine to haue power to enioye them. And specyally not hauyng any townes closed wyth walles, they made no greate matter to be dryuen from thence. thinking that they coulde lyue aswell in an other lande, whereby it maye be sayde, that they were not puissant nor hauynge greate townes nor apparayl of warre. So muche were all the quarters of the same Region subiected to the alterations of people, specyally the quarter whiche men nowe call Beoce,Beoce. the same of ThessaleThessale. and

                  illage of strangers. wherby I fynde yt the countreye of the Athenians & the regyon Attique, hath ben longer inhabyted by one only nation of people, than any of the other, for that, y• the lande there was so barren, yt the other had no care to come thyder to wynne it. but alwayes it hath bene (as men may see and perceyue) by meanes therof more peopled and increased wyth newe inhabitantes, than any of the other, by that

that they whiche were chosen out of other countreys by warre or for sedition, wythdrewe themselues thyther, as into a place sure and stable. In suche sorte, that the cytye of Athenes, which is theyr princypall towne, and al
                     •
                   the countrey came to so greate increase of people, that the lande coulde not nouryshe them, but were constrayned to sende parte into Ionū, and there to make Colonies, that is to saye, townes peopled with theyr nation. There is also an other argument, whiche doth clerely to knowe, that thys was not than anye greate thynge of the sayde countreye of Grece. That is, that it is fully certayne, that before the warre of Troye, that same Grece, whiche also is called Heliade, dyd nothyng by assembly. And also had not that same name vniuersally, specially afore Hellenes sonne of Deucalion,Helenes Deucalio. nor yet any tyme sythens, euery countreye hadde hys partycular name. But after that the sayde Hellenes and hys chyldren had occupyed Lordeshyp in Theotide,Phthiotia. they beganne to leade oute and to cause theyr people to go from the same countreye, throughe the other countrees, and by that meanes dyd enterpryse to enterm
                     •
                  dle, and vse merchaundyse. and then men began to call theym all, commonlye Hellenes, that is to saye, Grekes. And yet for all thys, they coulde not so sone obteygne the same denomination ouer all, by right longe tyme after, as it appeareth by this, that Homere, who was longe tyme after the sayde warre of Troye, nameth thē not all generally by that same name, but calleth onelye them so, whiche came frome Theotide wyth Achilles, who were the furste so called. But as touchynge the Danoes, the Argyues, and the A

                  heans he calleth them by theyr sayde particular names, and nameth them not therefore straungers, for that, as it semeth to me, that thys nomynation was not yet attributed to that hole nation and countreye, whiche we call Grece, nor dysseu
                     •
                  red from other. All the which (excepted the same) they name Barbarous or straunge. And for conclusyon all the same natyon, which is nowe called Grece, hadde thanne particuler names. And sythens by vsynge of one onely language, it hath bene commonly called Greke, which before the sayde warre of Troye, did neuer any thynge by assemblye, aswell by reason of theyr pouertye, as also for that, that they had no conuersatyon togidre. But to that enterpryse of Troye, they went all, by meanes that they than had had conuersatyon amonge themselues, and had frequented to eate together. For Minos,Minos. who is mooste auncyent of them of the sayde countrey, of whome we haue harde spoken, assembled a greate quantitie of shyppes, wherewith he dyd holde and rule the greater parte of the sea, which we call presently, the sea of Grece. And fyrst occupyed the Islandes called Ciclades, whiche he peopled wyth hys subiectes, hauyng dryuen from thence the Caryens. And after hys death, he lefte them for inheritaunce vnto his chyldren. A
                     •
                  d yet neuertheles chased from the same quartier the robbers of the sea, as muche as he might, as it is to be thought, to the intente to enioye the better the reuenues therof. For that, that the Grekes and other nations which inhabyted nyghe vnto the sea and to the Islandes, after that they begonne to vse shyppes, and to sayle, gaue them selues to pyllage and to robbe vpon the sea, hauynge appoynted for thys purpose, the myghtyest amonge them. And thus they dyd, aswell for theyr gaygne or lucre, as also to nouryshe the poore people, whiche dwelled on the lande. In suche sorte, that they daylye pyllaged the tounes that were openne, and not garnyshed wyth walles, and wyth the same pyllage, they lyuedde the more part of them, wythoute reputynge the sayde manner of lyuynge to be shamefull or a thynge dyshoneste. But rather dyd take it for glorye and honnoure, as men may see yet at thys presente daye, of manye, whiche exercyse the sayde Pyratycall or theuyshe crafte.

And that doth also declare it selfe by this, that it is founde wryttone in manye Poetes, 
                     •
                  hat whan the sayde people, whiche inhabited the sea at that tyme, dy

                   there encounter, they demaunded thone of the other, yf they were not theues. By which it is good to vnderstand, that they, which made suche demaundes, pretended that they dyd no vylleny to them, to whome they dyd it, nor toke it for shame to confesse it. And yet at thys present daye, in many quarters of Grece, they kepe the selfe custome, to wytte, amonge the Ozelians,Ozolee. that be in the countreye of Locriens,Locri. amonge the Etholiens,Aetoli. and the Acarnaniens,Acarnane. whiche be in firme lande, by occasyon wherof, they were accustomed to go armed. Whiche was tha
                     •
                   generall in all Grece, for that, that they had no suertye in theyr houses, nor yet in theyr iourneys. Wherfore they were constrayned for defence of theyr parsones, to go alwayes armed, lyke as all straungers do. And in so muche as men maye yet nowe see that there arne many countreys in Grece, whiche kepe thys manner of lyuynge: it is to be presumed, that it was auncyently the custome generall of all the Grekes. Amonge whome, the Athenyans were the furste, that beganne to leue thys custome, to go thus armed, and so forsakyng that same maner of lyuynge: they gaue them selfe to a cyuile and delycyous lyfe. And it is not longe tyme passed, sence the auncyent of the countrey, (truly they of moste reputacyon) dyd were robes of lynnen clothe tryfles and muskballes of golde and theyr heares tourned and trimmed rounde by nethe. And the same custome and maner of lyuynge hath bene vsed in Ionum by the accorde, whiche they had with the Athenyans. But the olde men sence that tyme there, haue to thys present, vsed a very small sort of habillementes. And the Lacedemonyās, which be most ryhe and moste pompous, aswell in habillementes, as in other maner of lyuynge, go all apparaylled of one sorte, the noble people, as the

                  e tyme, that they lefte to were them, and the straungers do yet vse them. specyallye the Aliatiques, when they make the prize for the wrastelers & fyghters. For they receyued none, yf they dyd not were breeches. And in many other thynges it maye be shewed, that the Grekes dyd in tymes past kepe those manners, whiche the rude people nowe holde. And to come agayne to our purpose of the cytyes of Grece, those, whiche of moste freshe memory were restoored and peopled, specyally those, that were ryche, and had greate nomber of people hauntynge the sea, buylded other cytyes vpon the portes and hauons of the sea. and that they myght more suerly vse mar

                  haundyse, and also defende thēselues frō their yll neyghbours: they kept the straytes of the lāde, which were betwene two seas, that is called Isthmos,Isthmi. but the auncyent cytyes be very farre from the sea, be they in Islandes or in fyrme lande. In the whiche, the furst founders were inhabyted to be farre from daunger of pyrates and robbers. for that, that they warred wyth the one and the other, aswell them, that dwelled in the lowe countreys, as also those which inhabyted an hyghe in the fyrme lande.Cares. Phenices. And specyally the Caryens and the Phenices (which inhabyted in the Islandes) vsed ye self crafte of Pyracy, by meanes that they helde many of the Islandes. And that hath bene founde by experyence in thys warre of the Athenyens, for in pourgyng the Islande of Delos and plucking doune all the graues of them, that were there deade and buryed, they knewe that more than the halfe nomber were Caryens, aswell by facyon of theyr harnoys, with the whiche they were engraued, as also by maner of theyr buryinge, whiche was holy suche, as now is vsed. After than,

that the Kynge Mynos had obteygned the Empire of the sea in that quarter, he chased the pyrates and theues from all the Islandes of the same sea, and in theyr stede dyd sende other people hys subiectes into many of them, for to inhabyte them. Who lyuing in more suertie, gaue them self more to excersise marchaundyse. Wherby some of them became so riche, that they enclosed theyr tounes with walles. And the other, which were most poore, and were not able to assure them selues wyth walles, dyd rendre themselues to be theyr subiectes by theyr owne wylle. to the intente, that they myght gaygne and vse marchaundyse vnder shadowe of them, that were more mightye. Whervpon being so augmented and enryched as is before sayd, in certayne tyme after, they assembled togethers to go to the siege of Troye. Amonge whome (in my iudgement) Agamenon was most myghtye.Agamē
                     non. and he assembled together not onely the shyppes, that were necessary to cary them, which had bene at the poursuyte of Helayne for to haue her to wyfe, whiche were bounde by othe made betwene the handes of Tyndarus father of the sayde Helayne to geue ayde for theyr power,Tindarus. to hym, yt shulde haue it agaynste all them, that for her cause, woulde do any 
                     •
                  ultrage or wronge vnto hym, but also a great nomber of other shyppes. And they (that diligently haue enquyred of auncyent feates of the Peloponesians) saye, that the same regyon of Peloponese was so named of one called Pelops,Pelops. who commyng thyther from the countreye of Asia wyth a greate quantytye of golde and syluer, albeit that he was a straunger, yet by reason of hys ryches, he was by the people of the countrey that were poore, honoured. In 
                     •
                  uche sorte, that they receyued hym for theyr Lorde. And after hys name called the countrey, Peloponese. and sythens hys deathe, hys successours and descente dyd yet get more great lordeshyppe. For it happened that Euritheus,Euritheus. wyllyng to go to make warre, agaynst the Myceniens, lefte Atreus to gouerne hys royaulme of Peloponese,Atreus. for that he was hys vncle, brother of hys mother, and also tha same Eurithens wythdrewe hym self thyder at that time, when hys father persecuted hym for ye death of Chrisyppus,Chrisippus. whome he slewe. The same Eurytheus then beyng slayne by the Heraclides in the countrey of Attique, the Mycenyens, that feared to fall into the handes of the sayd Heraclides, knowyng moreouer the sayd Atreus to be myghtye, and a man that loued the people, they receyued him vnto theyr lorde. And by meane therof, he was Kyng and Lorde of Micena wyth all the rest of ye landes of his said nephieu Euritheus. By meane wherof, the Pelopides, to wit, the discente of Pelops were more myghtye than the Persydes, to wytt, the descente of Perseus. Who before had dominyon of that countreye. Agamenon succedynge the same Euritheus, which also was a man myghtye by sea, more than any other of the Grekes, assembled in the sayd countreys whiche he helde, thys armie, more by force, than by loue, for it is very certayne, that he came to the said siege of Troye with greater nomber of shyppes, than any of the other, and that he gaue of the sayde shyppes, vnto the Acardyans, lyke as Homerus recyteth, yf we woll take hys testimonye to be suffycyent in thys behaulf. For in speakynge, as a man had geuen hym the Royall sceptre, he saych that the same Agamenon, besydes the countreys that he helde in fyrme lande, had rule in many Islandes. and that coulde no man do that dwelled in fyrme lande (reserued the Islandes nexte vnto them, which were not many in nomber) yf he had not bene mighty by sea And as touchynge that hooste, that Euritheus brought to Mycena, we maye well iudge, that they myght haue bene they, that were assembled before in the countreye of Grece. For Micena was a very lytle towne, and though in that tyme it was taken to be greate, yet nowe it wolde not so be taken, whiche

is an argument euydent ynough to beleue, that he had not there so great nomber of shyppes at the Siege of Troye, as Poetes haue wryttonne, and as the renome hath rōned sithens. For yf the cyty of Lacedemoniēs were not inhabyted, and that there remayned but the temples and comone buyldynges, I beleue, that in successyon of tyme, men woulde not beleue at the syght, that it hath bene so stronge, and so puyssant, as it nowe is. albeit that it holdeth two partes of the lymyttes of all Peloponese for hys terrytorye, and ruleth all the remenant, and that it hath many other cytyes and landes out of the sayd Peloponese in hys allyance. And neuertheles before the sayd cytye was well peopledde and buylded wyth sumptuous temples and other edifyces (Than whan the people were dyspersed through the vyllages, lyke as all the other people of Grece were) It is clere and manyfeste that it semed muche lesse. The cytye of Athenes shulde be an other thynge, yf the lyke shulde chaunce, that it were habondoned, for mē might ymagyne and iudge in seynge the greatnes and situation of the same, that it had bene double more myghty than it is. And thus I conclude that we ought not holy to beleue that, which Poetes haue wryttonne of the sayd armye of Troye, nor to haue more regarde to the greatnes of cytes, then to theyr power. And that the same hoste was greater then any of them, whiche had bene before, but much lesse then those, that men make at this present, we may well beleue it by the Poesye of Homer. For although it be very lykely, that he made the thynge more greate than it was after the style Poeticall, for to geue more great lustre or beautye vnto hys declaratyon: yet were not those same than, so greate, as these in thys present tyme. And that may appere by thys, that of the twelf hundred shyppes, which he recōneth, he wryteth that those of the Beotiens caryed euery one, a houndred and twenty men, and they of Philoctete syfty. wyllyng to shew by thys, what the greatest and the lea
                     •
                  t shyppes myght cary, seing that he maketh no mentyon of the greatnes of the other, nor of the nomber of the people that they caryed. which is to declare, that the greatest caryed but one houndred and twentye men, and the lesse fyfty. And also it appereth that all they, whiche were in the shyppes of Philoctete were both warryers and maronners, by that he sayth that they were all men of warre, aswell the maronners, as the other, as he sayth. And also it is to beleue, in so muche that the Kynges and Dukes of the countrey passed the sea wyth theyr puyssance and apparaylle for the sea, that there taryed not many people in the countrey. And also they had not than shyypes couered and stronge, as men haue nowe a dayes. But they were onely small slight shyppes mete for to robbe vpon the sea. And therfor (takyng thē for meane) betwene the greatest and leaste, he coulde not haue so great nomber of people in them, that men myght saye, that they had bene sente by the common assemblye of all Grece. And that chaunsed more for faulte of moneye, thanne for 
                     •
                  aulte of people. For they myght not cary but so manye people, as they thought to be hable to nourysh, duryng the warre. Nowe is it very certayne, that after they were arryued, they were the stronger. For elles they of Troye woulde not haue permitted them to close theyr camp vnto the walles. And also they ayded not them selues durynge the siege wyth all the people, that they had brought out. But for faulte of vyctuayles, they were constrained to sende one parte to laboure the countreye of Cheronese, and one other parte to robbe and 
                     •
                  yllage by sea. So that beyng so dyspersed, they susteygned warre agaynst the Troyās, the space of tenne yeares, aswell in defendynge, as in assayllynge, for that, that they were indifferēt and egall in force, by meanes of the absence of the people, which the same Grekes had sente oute to laboure and for pyllage, but yf they had bad

prouision of victuailes, so that withoute goinge to laboure and pillage, they might haue taryed altogithere, certaynely, they might haue taken the cytie and haue destroyed it, as they dyd after, wtin muche lesse tyme, but they had inough to do for a tyme, to defende thēselues. So than it must conclude, that the warres and armyes, whyche haue be
                     •
                  ore thys of Troye were very smalle for lacke of monney and that the selfe same, whyche is most celebrated and most renommed, was muche lesse than poetes haue writtonne. And furthermore it is manyfest that the Grekes after that warre, were oft tymes chased from thair countrey, and constrayned to go to dwelle in other countreys, so that they had not so muche reste, that they myghte multeplye and encrease. & that chaunced, for that they had bene soo longe at the siege of Troye, that at thair retourne, they found many thynges chaunged. and many sedytions arose in the cytes, so that some of them, that had destroyed the sayde cytie o

And the Doriens,Dores. about foure skoore yeares after the sayd destructiō of Troye, helde Peloponese. And a longe tyme after ye coūtrey of Grece beinge with greate defficultie peasable, and the inhabitantes assuredde, they beganne to sende fourth thair people for to inhabite other coūtrees. Amonge the whyche, the Athenyens dydde people the countrey of Ionū. and some other Islandes. And the Peloponesians and other people of the reste of Grece, dydde people Italye and Sycilie. All which thynges were done, sythens the takynge of Troye.

But anonne after, warre began bitwene the same two cyties and thair allyes. and there was no naciō of Grekes in any parte of the worlde that folowed not the one parte or other. In such sort, that frō the warres of the Medes vntill thys here, wherof we speake, they haue bene alwayes in warre or in respyte of warre, to wytte, the sayd cyties, the one agaynst the other, or ells agaynst thair subiectes, that rebelled agaynst them. By meanes wherof, they be by longe
experyence greatly exercysed in armes, and also be well prouyded of all thynges necessary for warre. Nowe the sayd two cyties had dyuers manner of lyuynge with thair subiectes and allyes. For the Lacedemonyens made not thairs, trybutoires. but wolde alonely that they shulde gouerne themselues as they dyd, to wytt, by a certayne small nomber of the moste honest people amongest them, for thair profitt and vtilitie. But the Atheniēs by a lytle and a lytle gott to them all the good shippes that thair allyes had, excepte them of Chio and of Lesbos,Chio.

Suche was the estate of Grece in auncyente tyme, as farre as I canne fynde. albeit that it be ryght harde to beleue, if a man wolde narrowely consyder and debate all the tokens or signes. For somuche as the people that heare speakynge of thynges passed (though that it be of thair countreys and of thair owne ancesters) they suffre the bruyte to spreade abrode & ronne as one reporteth it vnto thē, wythoute enquyrynge any further of the trouthe.

So they thought it expedyent to sende Ambassade towardes the Athenyans to make allyance wyth them, and to gett of them some succour, if it were possible. whyche seinge the Corynthians, they lykewyse sente thair Ambassade to the Athenyens for to lett, that they shulde not geue any succour to the sayd Corcyriens.

And it is to be pardoned though we presume nowe to do agaynst our auncyent custome and opynion, wherein we haue longe perseuered through errour, and not of malyce. And if youe wol throughly heare what we woll saye, this allyance, whyche we demaunde of necessyte of youe, shalbe honn

                  rable and profytable by many reasons. Furste that youe shall ayde them, that be oultraged or wronged, and not those that do wronge. Secondarely by that, that youe shall succoure them that be in ryghte greate daunger, youe shall employe that benefytt in that place yt euer shalbe hadde in remembrance, and furthermore beynge myghtie by sea as we bee, consyder whan there maye euer comme a better occasyon for youre increase and prosperyte, and to the greater descouragynge of your ennemyes, than to see to be offered vnto youe (and that wythoute any coste or daunger) the greate puyssance, whyche youe shulde buy at hyghe pryce and wythe greate intercessyon. and besydes thys, youe shall gette prays of all natyons, and an perpetuall oblygatyon of them, that youe shall haue defended, and also youe shall greatly increase youre strengthe. All whyche thynges haue not very oftentymes chaunced to oure remembrance. and it hathe not bene many tymes sene that they that requyred succoure of other in feate of

warre, haue offredde them asmuche ayde and saruyce, as they demaunded of them. And if any man woulde say that we canne sarue for nothynge but in tyme of warre, and that yow haue none, truly he deceyueth hymselfe greatly. and vnderstandeth not, that the Lacedemonyans, fearynge your puissaunce, do prepare themselues to warre agaynst you, and that the Corynthiens, whyche haue great amytie with them and be your ennemies, go aboute to subdue vs, for to haue afterwardes the better meanes to assaulte youe, to the intente that we, whome they hate as they do you, shulde not be hable afterwardes to come to succour you. and that we shulde not putt them by of one of the two opynions that they haue, to wytt to hurte vs and to fortefie themselues. Wherfore reasone woll that you receyue vs into your allyance, sythens that we requyer it. And by this mean that youe preuent thair imaginacions & pretenses, rather than to be afterwardes constraynned to vse to comme by contrarys and newe remedys. And if they woll say, that it is not honnest that you receue into your allyance thair burgeoses, they ought to consyder, that euery Colouie or cōpany of inhabitantes ought to honnor hys cytie Metropolitayne, that hath founded it, whā that it doth him good, but if it entreateth thother noughtely, it must departe frō his frendeshipp. For men do not sende Citezeins into newe places to inhabitt, to the intent that they shulde sarue them that taryed in the cytie, but to the ende, that they may be lyke and as brotherne. Nowe it is very notorious that the Corynthyans hathe wronged vs. for where we presented. them to stande to tryall and iudgement touchynge the cytie of Epydanne, they had leuer debate thair quarelle by warre, than by frendeshyppe. And that whych they do agaynst vs that be thair burgeoses and parentes, ought to make you wyse. and not to suffer yourselues to be deceyued with thair trōperies nor to obey to thair fraudulente requestes, for he

                  etwene you and them, consyderyng that we are not allyed to thone nor the other. And by the same treatie it is prouided, that if there be any cytie of Grece, that be not allyed to the one nor to the othere of the sayd cyties, yt may allye it self. vnto whyche of them yt woll. And yt shuld be very strange and vnreasonable, that they myghte arme thair shippes not onely with your frendes and allyes, but also with your subiectes, and that it may not be laufulle for youe to accepte an allyance, whyche men comme to offerre to you. nor to do your proffit there, where youe may, and that it shuld be imputed vnto youe for cryme or offence if youe dyd graunte vnto vs that whych we demaūde. Truly we shuld haue muche greater cause to sorowe for youe, if you wolde not graunte vs our requeste whyche be not your ennemyes, seing vs in suche dangier. And howe muche goodnes so euer youe dyd, youe shulde not therby appease thies here, which be your ennemys, of thair ill intent & purpose. but youe shulde permyt thē through your necligēce to take away your strēgth, which you ought not to do, but rather to defēde, that none of your subiectes shuld go to thair wages. and in receyuyng vs to your allyance, to sende vs suche succour, as youe shal thynke good, opēly, wherby many comodyties shal come vnto youe lyke as we haue shewed in ye begynnyng & aboue al other do shewe thys folowyng. For it is notorious, that thies here be our enemyes, & also they haue power to chastise & correcte thē yt they repute to rebelle, against thē. wherfore seing that we do offre you a felliship & alliāce to ayde you & sarue in ye sea, & not onely by land, in suffring vs to be lost, you shal haue much greter losse & dōmage, thā if you did lese but people

of maynne lande. For youe shulde bryng it to pas (yf you coulde) that none myght be so puyssant by sea as you, and yf you coulde not do that, at the leaste that all they that hadde power there, might be your frendes and allyes. I haue no doubte that the causes whiche we shewe, do not seme to euery of you, vtyle and profytable, but some maye feare, that in thus doyng, youe shulde breake the peace. Unto whome we answere. That it is better for you not to trust so much to that confederation, and for to encrease your strength, by meanes wherof you shall kepe youre ennemyes in feare, rather, than trustynge therunto, not to be wyllynge to receyue vs to youre allyance, and to abyde more feble, seynge your ennemyes so stronge.

                   case for to be receyued to your allyaunce, but also of vs, saying that we haue vniustely bigonne warre vpon them, it is necessary for vs to make mention of bothe. and afterwardes to shewe youe, that youe ought to admit our demaunde (which is very reasonale) and to reiect the prouffites, that they here do presente youe against reasone. They furst say, that by modestie they neuer haue made allyance wyth any cytye. But trulye yt hath not bene, neyther for modestye nor for vertue, but throughe noughtynes, for that, that they woulde not haue any compaignyon nor wytnes to theyr myscheues and yll dedes, that myght rebuke nor warne them of theyr shame. Also the situatyon of theyr towne, is mete to make, that they maye be arbyters of the oultrages that they commyt wythout commynge into any iudgemente of reasone. For that they wente not muche into other Regyons, but the other nations came to them for marchaundyse. And so that, whiche they pretende for theyr glory, not to haue wylled to make allyance wyth other people, hath not bene

to that intent, that they had not bene partakers and felowes of the vyolences & iniuryes that the other commytted lyke as they say: but to the ende that of those crymes that they dyd perpetrate, there shulde be no arbitratours nor wytnes. And where they were strongest, myght wrong the other, thinking that so much they made theyr proffit the more, that their pyllage was more secrete, and also hadde therm the lesse shame. And yf they were so honnest people, as they saye, they shulde shewe more theyr vertue and wysdome, in geuyng and receyuynge thinges raysonnable. which they haue not done towardes other, and lesse towardes vs. For albeyt that they be oure burgeoses, and that we haue founded and established them, yet notwythstandynge before thys tyme, they be departed from vs, and nowe they warre agaynste vs. And where they saye, that we haue not sent them from our cytye to inhabyte there for to be euyll intreated or wronged by vs, we aunswere them, that we also haue not lodged thē there, to receyue oultrages and vilanyes of them, but for to be alwaies theyr superiours. And that they shulde honour vs so, as reasone woll, and as they do, yt we haue sente to other Colonies. All the which beare vs singulier loue and reuerence. Whereby it may suffyciently appeare, that inasmuche as we be agreable to all the other, whiche be in greater nomber: they heare do wrongfully hate vs. and yf we haue warred agaynste them, it hath not bene wythoute reason, nor for a small cause. And in so muche as we haue done them good for a small occasyon, raysone wolde that they shuld haue endured and borne with our angre, and so we shulde haue had regarde to theyr pacience & modestie. But they, trustynge in theyr ryches, after many insolencies, that they had vsed agaynst vs, camero take and occupye the towne of Epydanne. which is of our iurisdictiō.

                  , for this is not to purpose whan a man hath occupyed & holden a thinge frō another, to appeale it into iudgement, but men shulde present suche partes before they come by force. which they haue not done. but they offred vs the waye of iustyce onely at that tyme, whan they helde the towne assieged, and that they sawe vs ready to come to succour it. And not content with that, they arne come hyther towardes you, to requyre, that you wolle receyue them vnto your allyance, and to be theyr compaignyons. And that not onely to the warre, but also to theyr vyolences and vnryghtuousnes, beynge oure ennemyes. which thing they shuld rather haue demaunded, whan they had nothing done vnto vs, and not nowe, that they haue wronged vs, and see themselues in daunger and sithens that you haue had no partycypatyon wyth them, nor receyued any saruyce of them than, whan they were wythout busynes, you ought not nowe at thys presente, to communycate to them your power. But rather, as youe haue not bene parttakers of theyr offences, so oughte youe to kepe your selues from incurrynge for theyr cause, into any faulte towardes vs. For it is to them, which haue in tymes passed communycated theyr force wt their frendes, that men ought, whan the case requyreth it, to render the lyke. But youe that haue not in anye thynge particypated of the crymes and vyolences of these here vnto thys presente, haue no occasyon to entermedle of their affayres for the tyme to comme. Nowe we haue declared to youe, and done to be knowen (as it apperteygneth) that we be grounded in good reasone, & equitie agaynste them here, and that they haue oultraged vs, by their violence & couetyce. It nowe resteth to cause it to appeare, that you may not wt reasone

receyue them into your amytie and allyance. For albeit that it be sayde by oure treatie of peace, that it is laufull for all the cytyes of Grece, that were not of your alliance, nor of ours, to ioygne them to which of vs they wolde, that is not to be vnderstanded, that they maye do it to the preiudice of the other partie. but it is ment for them, that haue nede of ayde, and demaunde it. Wythoute that, yt they, of whome they demaunde it, shulde depart from the allyance of the other. And not for them, that vnder colour of bringyng and requyrynge peace, shulde procure warre agaynst the frendes of them, of whome they demaunde it. Which thynge woll presently chaunce, yf you regarde not that, which we woll say vnto you. For yf you receyue these here, you shall not onely be theyr allyes, but you shall also becōme of our frendes, our ennemyes. And therfor yf you be wt them, it shall iustely force vs in reuēgyng o

But than, whan the Samyans rebelled agaynste you, and that the other Peloponesyans were in contentyon and dyuers opynyons, whyder they ought to be ayded or not, we iudged not against youe. For it semed also vnto vs to be agaynst reasonne, to prohibyte anny parsonne to chastice hys subiectes. And yf that ye woll retire, wythdrawe and defende our subiectes, that shall haue commytted any

For that, that youe haue greater nomber of subiectes, than we. To conclude, we thinke that we haue shewed and suffyciently declared before you accordyng to the lawes of Grece, our right, and that whiche raysonne wolleth. and that whiche we shall hereafter shewe, is in manner by exhortacyon and requeste. And also we woll not demaunde any thynge of youe, as youre ennemyes to hurt you, nor yet as your frendes to abuse you, but for to be vsed accordynge to raysonne. and also we thinke that youe ought to do it, for that, that in that tyme, that you had warre agaynste the Egenytes before the warre of the Medyans,Eginete at which tyme youe had no great shippes: the Corynthyens leante you, twenty. By meanes of whiche seruice, you had the victorie agaynst the sayde Egynetes. and by meanes of this, that the other Peloponesians dyd for oure loue, not geue any succour vnto the Samyans, you toke vengeance on them at youre wille. And that was done in tyme of one so greate a warre, that the people, for the desyre that they had to vainquyshe their ennemy, regarded none other thynge. But helde for frende all men that ayded them at that theyr busynes, though that before they had bene theyr ennemyes, and for ennemy, euery man that was on the other parte, although he had bene before, their frende. For also they left theyr particular and domestycal affayres, wythout geuing order therin, for the desyre and obstinacye that they had to reuenge them on theyr enemyes. Wherfore those amonge you, that haue remembraunce of the sayd pleasures and seruyces, and the other yonger men, that haue harde it spoken by youre auncyentes, ought to be of opinion, that mē shuld recompence them by lyke meanes. And yf it shulde be sayde that that, which we speake is very reasonable, but that that, which the other present, shulde be more profytable, yf there be warre, we aunswere you, that howe muche the more, that men procede iustely in theyr causes, so much the greater profyt doth. comonlye

followe. And the warre, wherof the Corcyryens do put you in fears, and for doubte therof, do persuade you to do vnreasonable actes, is not yet certayne that it shall fortune. And therefore it is not reasonable, that for suspytyone of a warre incertayne, youe shulde take the quarell presented by the Corcyryens agaynst vs, your frendes and allyes. And yf youe haue any Imagynation of the sayde warre for suspycyon that is chaunced betwene vs, by meanes of them of Megare, youe ought by your wyttes and prudence nowe to dymynyshe and asswage it, rather, than to encrease it. For a good saruyce done in seasone, though i

               Howe the Athenians receyued the Corcyryens into theyr allyance, and sente them succours. And howe the Corinthiens and Corcyryens had a battaile by sea, wherof ayther of them, toke it to haue the vyctorye. The .v. Chapter.
               AFter that the Athenyans had harde bothe parties, they dyd put the matter into deliberatyon two tymes. Whereby, at the furst they foūd the raysons of the Corinthiens as good as the other. But at the secōd tyme, they changed theyr opynyon, and concluded to make allyance wyth the Corcyryans, not in the manner that they requyred it. To wytte, for to be frendes of frendes, and ennemys of ennemys. For in that doinge and goyng agaynst the Corynthyans wyth them, they had broken the allyance that they had wyth the Peloponesians. But onely for defence of the one partye and of the other, yf any came to assaultt them or anye of theyr allyes. For withoute that, they doubted greatelye to haue warre wyth the Peloponesians. and they wolde not suffre the Corcyryens to be destroyed, who were so stronge by sea. But they woulde suffre them to warre amōgest themselues, by that meane to dymynyshe theyr strengthe, and after that they were weakened, to take warre agaynst hym, that they shulde thinke good. On the other parte, they consydered

                  ylle. To thys intente, the Athenyans made allyance & confederation wyth the Corcyryans in the manner that is declared. And anone after the departure of the Corynthyans, they sente them for succour, tenne shippes armed. wherof Lacedemonius,Lacedemonius sonne of Cymō, Dyotymus,Diotymus. sonne of Strō
                  bicus, and Protheas,Proteas sonne of Epycles were Capytaynes. Unto whom they defended, that they shulde fyght agaynst the Corynthyans, excepte they came agaynst Corcyre, and would go on lande for to take or endommage the cytye or territorye of the same. in whiche case, they myght defende them for theyr power, fearyng to breake the peace, which they had wyth the Corynthyans, which they pretended not to do by that meane. After that the sayd tenne shyppes were departed, the Corynthyans, who had made theyr preparatyon, came agaynste the sayde Islande of Corcyre, wyth an houndred and fyftye shyppes, of y• whiche there were tenne of the Helyens, and asmany of the Eleucadyens, twelue of the Megarens .xxvii. of Ambracyens, one of the Anactoryens, and the reste of theyr owne, which were foure skore and tenne. And euery of the straungers had theyr Capytaynes and rulers by them self. Of the succours that they had sent, and of the shyppes of the Corinthians, Xenoclides sonne of Eurydes wyth foure collegues or compaignyons that were appoynted vnto hym, was Capytayne, So they departed altogether wyth a good wynde from the poorte of Leucade, and came v

                  to the lande, that is foranempste the Islande of Corcyre. to wytt to the moūteigne, named Cymerium,Chimerium. which is ye mouth or entry of Thesphrotide.Thesphrotydes. In whiche place there is a poorte, and above the poorte, a cytye distante from the sea, named Ephire,Ephire. and nere vnto the same, there is an other citie, in the selfe regyon of Thesphrotyde, named Eleatyde, about which, goeth a great marreys, which indureth to the sea named Acheruse by meane of the ryuer of Acherō,
                     Acherusia.
                     Acheron
                   which after that it hath trauersed the sayd countreye of Thesphrotide, ronneth ouer the sayd Marreys, and on the other syde, runneth into the sea, an other ryuer named Thyamys,Thyamys. which departeth the countreye of Thesprotyde, and that same of Cestryne.Cestrines. Betwene these twayne ryuers, is situated the sayd promontory and rocke named Cymeriū. Into the same place, came the Corinthians to take lande. The Corcyryens, beyng aduertysed of theyr commynge, came wt an houndred & tenne shyppes to plant theyr campe, in one of the next Islandes there named Sibota.Sibota. And Mycyades and Esimides Eurybatian,
                     Misiades.
                     Aesimides.
                   were Capytaynes of theyr armye. They had more besyde the sayde nomber, tenne shyppes, wyth Athenyans. And besyde that, they had set vpon the promontory of Leucyne an thousande foote men,Leucumia. that the Pacynthyans had sente to theyr succoure. And also they loked to be socoured by straungers, whiche inhabyted there adioynynge, which were alwayes theyr frendes. After that the Corynthyans had sett theyr matters in order, and taken victuailes for thre dayes, they departed by nyght from the sayde promountory Cymeriū, to comme to fyght wyth ye Corcyryens. And by that it was day, they sawe them a farre of in the mayne sea, comming ryght agaynst them. So they put them selues in battayle on both sydes. and made theyr order as followeth. The Corcyryens dyd put on the ryght syde, the tenne shyppes of Athenes, & they deuided thē selues in thre bandes on the left syde, euerye of them hauyng hys Capitaine. On the Corinthians syde, the Ambratiens and the Magarens were on the right winge, in the middle were the other allyes, so as they were founde, and in the lefte wynge dyrectly agaynst the ryght wynge of the Corcyryens were the Corinthiens theyr selues. In thys manner came the one agaynste the other, hauyng eyther of both sydes

geuen tokens to fyght, and aither of them had bestowed a great nombre of Archers and of other well armed, in the toppes of their shyppes vpon top castels, euyll ynough appoynted after the fashyon of that tyme. and they foughte verye sharpely, but not by arte (as they do at this dayes vpon the sea) but hande to hande wythout remouing, as fote men do, that fyght on mayne lande. For after that they were myngled together, they coulde not well remoue thē selues, nor droune the one the other. And ye hope of victory was in them, that fought in the toppe castells, rather than in any other thynge. And in effecte they fought more by strengthe and by courage, than by connynge. The fight and conflicte was very great. And the shippes of Athens went to succoure the Corcyryēs, where as they sawe thē ouercommed, for to feare the ennemyes, and yet they dyd not fyght agaynste them, fearyng to disobeye the commaundement of theyr Lordes. So chaunced it, that the Corinthiens that were on the right wynge, were so ouercharged by theyr ennemies, that they toke them self vnto flight and were chased and followed by tenne shyppes of the Corcyryens vntyll the lande, where theyr campe was. and they landed after thē in suche sorte, that they toke & pillaged al that, that they found within. and afterwardes set fyer therin. But in the meane tyme that those were there occupyed in the chase & in pillage, the Corinthiens y• were in the left wynge, hadde easely victory agaynst theyr ennemyes, that taried and fought agaynst them, for also they were stronger in shyppes. The Atheniās than seynge the Corcyryens so ouercharged and put to rebuke, beganne to succoure them earnestly and wythout dissymulation. and yet inuaded not the Corinthians at the begynnyng. But after that they sawe the Corcyryens in flight, and the other that chased them: they bent them selfe to fyght, and to resiste, the beste that they coulde, wythoute makynge any dyfference of the one, or of the other. For that, that necessytye requyred it, so that the battaylle remayned betwene the Athenyans and the Corynthyans, the Corcyryans beyng in flyght. neuertheles at the last they were constrayned to wythdrawe them selues after the other, and so the Corinthyans followed the chase. And taried not to bynde, and fasten to theyr shyppes the barkes of the shyppes that they had beaten downe, nor yet to cause them, that they had taken, to be towed to lande, but in sayling & chasynge, they indeuored themselues more to slaye the ennemyes, then to take them alyue. whiche doyng they slewe many of theyr frendes, that they founde in theyr waye vpon theyr shippes and on the bottomes of them of theyr syde, that had bene dyscomfyted, thinking, that they had bene enemyes. For so great nomber of shyppes beynge assembled, aswell on the one syde, as on the other, and all Grekes, after that they were myngled togeder, they knewe not well the one, the other. And they coulde not tell, who were the ouercommers or ouercommed. Also truly, this was the greatest assemblye of shyppes, that euer in tymes paste had bene made of Grekes, agaynst Grekes. After that the Corinthians had had chased the Corcyriens to the entrye of the sea, they dyd retourne to receyue their shippwrackes and shyppes skatered abroade and brused, and also theyr people that were hurte. So they founde a greate nomber whiche they brought vnto the poorte that is oueranempste from the Islande of Sybota in the fyrme lande, which is holy deserte in the regyon of Thesphrotyde, where the straungers that were comme to theyr ayde, dyd tary them on lāde. And after that they had bestowed there theyr brused shyppes and theyr hurte people, they sayled agayne with the other shyppes, that they hadde hoole, for to go agaynst Corcyre. whiche seyng the Corcyriens, came agaynst them with those hole shippes, and them of Athens that were lefte. Fearynge that the sayde Corynthyaus wolde haue made

some entry into their lande. Nowit was than late and very nyght, and they had nowe begonne to geue token that they woulde fyght. Whan the Corinthians perceyued, a farre of in the sea, twenty shyppes, that the Athenyans hadde sent a freshe vnto the Corcyryans. fearyng that the tēne, which they sente them furst, were not suffycyent ynough to saue and defende them, lyke as also it chaunced, by occasyon thereof, the Corinthians begonne to take their oores, and by litle & lytle to retourne backe, for that principally, that they knewe not whyther there came a greater nomber after the same that they sawe or not. whereat the Corcyryens, which coulde not yet see theyr sayd succoure, were all abasshedde, seing theyr ennemyes so to retourne, and coulde not thinke wherfore it was, vntyll that some of theyr people perceyued the sayd twenty shyppes, and signifyed to them, that they came directly vnto them. Then beyng nowe also night, the Corcyryens lykewyse wythdrewe themselues, and in thys manner, hauyng foughte vnto darke night: they departed. And anone after, the sayde twenty shippes, aryued at the porte of Leucine where the Corcyryens were wythdrawen, passynge ouer the deade and the broken peces of the shyppes, that were brused & drowned. of which twenty shyppes Glaucō sōne of Leager & Andocydes sonne of Leogorus had the conducte.
                     Glaucō.
                     Andocides.
                   And for that, that it was night, the Corcyryens at the furste burnte were in doubte, that they had bene ennemys. But hauynge certen knowlayge of them, they receyued them with greate ioye. The morowe after, the thirty shyppes of the Athenyans, wyth them, that were lefte hoole vnto the Corcyryens, wente out of the poorte wyth theyr sayles displayed and came agaynst the porte of Sibota where the Corinthians were, to see yf they would come agayne to battayle. Who, whan they sawe them so to come, departed frō the porte into the mayne sea all in good order, and there kepte themself sure only to defende them, not willing to go to assayle thē. For that, that they feared the sayde shyppes newely comme, which were all freshe and hoole, and theyrs were greatly hurte or empayred at the battayle the day before. and theyr people were busyed to kepe the prysonners that they had taken in the sayde battaile. and also they coulde not refreshe themselues wyth any thynge in the place of Sibota where they were, for that, that it was deserte and barayne. So they cared not, but howe they might honnestly wythdrawe them self into theyr quarter, fearyng that the Athenyans wolde not suffer them to departe from thence, vnder coulour that they hadde broken the peace, by that, that they came to assayle thē the daye before. So they deuysed to sende vpon a brygantyne some of theyr people towardes the sayde Athenyans, withoute any heraulte, for to espye what they wolde do. Who spake vnto thē in this maner. You do agaynst reasone (lordes Atheniens) to begynne warre vpon vs, commyng directly agaynst the treatie of peace, that we haue togidres. and to let vs that we maye not chastyse oure subiectes. And yf you be deliberated so to do and to empesthe vs that we maye not go agaynst the Corcyryens, or ells where that we woll, and by that meane will to declare your selues our ennemyes, beginne with vs that be here, & intreat vs as enemys. At which wordes the Corcyryēs that coulde vnderstande them, beganne to crye all wt one voice, yt they shuld be taken, and all slaine incontinētly. But the Athenians aunswered thē in this manner. Lordes Peloponesians, we perceyue not, that we haue broken the treatie of peace, whiche we haue with youe. For we be not comme hyther to fyghte wyth youe, but onely to defende and kepe the Corcyryens oure allyes. Wherfore yf youe woll go anye where elles than into theyr lande, we woll not trouble youe, but yf you come to endomage theyme, we woll defende them with our power. which aunswere receyued

by the Corynthians, they prepared them self to retourne vnto their houses. But before theyr departure, they sett vp theyr Trophee in token of victory in the firme lande of Sibota. And after theyr departynge, the Corcyryens gathered togeder theyr brokenne shyppes, and deade people, whome the wynde, from of the marreys, had in the nyght dryuē to the shore of the sea, euen as they aryued. Afterwardes they set vp an other Trophee in signe of victory in the Islande of Sibota, directly agaynste that same of the Corinthians. For bothe parties pretended to haue had the victory. To wytt the Corinthians for that, yt they kepte the sea vntyll nyght, and gathered many shipwrackes of the shippes drowned, and also great nomber of their deade people, and further had taken more than a thousande prysonners and drowned aboutes threskoore & tenne shippes with ennemys. And the Corcyryens, for that they had drowned about .xxx. shyppes with ennemys, and gathered together the shipwrackes and theyr deade bodies aswell as they. And moreouer for that the daye followyng, hauing had the new ayde and strengthe of Athenyans, they had offred them battayle, and they durst not marche forwardes, but were retyred. In thys manner both partyes departed, hauynge opynyon of the victory. The Corinthians, in theyr retourne, toke sodenly and pryuely the towne and porte of Anactorye,Anactorium. which is at the entrye of the Goulphe of Ambracie,Ambracium. whiche poorte was common betwene them, and the Corcyryens, so they fournyshed it wyth theyr people. And afterwardes retourned to Corynthe. where beyng aryued, they solde of the Corcyriens, which they had prysonners, aboutes eight houndred, and two hundred and fyftye they reteygned, ouer whome they set good watche, trustyng by theyr meane to ouercome and recouer Corcyre. For the more parte of the sayde prysonners were of the principall of the cytye. Suche was the ende of the same furste warre betwene ye Corynthyans and Corcyriens, after the whiche, the Corinthians retourned to theyr habytacyons.
            
            
               The other quarells & occasions of warre, that happened betwene the Athenians and the Corinthians. By meane wherof, all the Peloponesians were assembled at Lacedemonye for to conclude warre agaynst the sayde Athenyans. Cap. vi.
               THe warre, wherof we haue spoken, was the chief occasyon of ye same, that was afterwardes betwene the Corynthians and the Athenyans. For that the sayde Corinthians pretended, that the same Athenyans had broken the treatye of peace wt them, by geuyng succours vnto the Corcyriens agaynste them. Afterwardes there chaunced other occasyons to moue warre betwene the sayd Athenyans and all the Peloponesians, which were these. The Athenyans, perceyuynge that the Corinthians wente aboute to reuenge them selues on them, came to the towne of Potydea,Potidea. whiche is vpon the destrayte of Palenes, & was one of the Colonies of the same Corinthians, and theyr subiect. So they cōmaunded vnto the inhabitantes, that they shuld rase downe their walle of the syde of Palenes,Palenes. And furthere to geue thē pleadges, and to dryue away theyr gouernours and offycers (whome the Corinthians called artifycers, and sente theym euery yeare vnto them) & not to receyue them more from thence forwardes, And this dyd they, fearynge that the sayd Potydiās, shuld haue declared agaynst them, & also caused the other allyes to declare, which were in the coūtrey of Thrace at the procurement & instigatiō

For feare of which allyaunce, he wente to the Lacedemonians, and had perswaded thē to make warre agaynste the Athenyans And so was allyed with the Corinthiens for to take into hys tuition the towne of Potyde. And furthermore he practised with them of the countrey of Chalcyde that be in Thrace,Chalcides. and with the Beotiēs, for to cause them to rebell agaynste the Athenyans, hopynge that yf through thayde of the same townes and countreys, he myght brynge them to his allyance, he myght make stronge warre agaynste the sayde Athenians. Who, whā they vnderstode it, for to let the reuoltement or rebellyon of the said cities and countreys, delyberated to send Acestratus, sonne of Lencomedes accompanyed wyth tenne other Capytaynes wyth .xxx. shippes armed for to make warre in the coū
                  trey of Macedonie. And commaūded thē, that in passyng, they shuld take pleadges of thē of Potide, and beate downe theyr walle. And furthermore that they shulde take good hede that the other cytyes dyd not rebelle. whiche vnderstandynge the Potydyans, sente some of theyr cytezeins to Athens for to see, yf they coulde obteigne of them, that they wolde do no nouueltie. And on the other syde they sente wyth the Corynthians to Lacedemonye to haue of them counsaille and comforte. who perswaded them that they shulde prepare to defende themselues, yf anye woulde constrayne them, to that, which is declared. Duryng this tyme the Ambassadours, that were gone to Athens: after that they had at lēgth shewed & debated theyr case, obteigned very litle of them. But they had, in their pre

Which Calcydes Perdicas had perswaded, that they shulde habandone, & forsake theyr townes that they hadde on the shore of the sea, for that they were not defensyble. And that they shulde wythdrawe them self into the cytye of Olynthe which standeth Inner into the lande, and that they shulde fortefye the same aswell as they could. And vnto them that had habandoned theyr townes & howses, he gaue them to dwelle in, durynge the warre, the cytye of Migdonie,Migdonia. which is nyghe the marr

During this tyme, yt the shyppes wt Athenyans were in Macedonie, the Corinthiens, fearing yt the cytye of Potyde, whiche had declared it self agaynst the Atheniās, had no succour, for yt they toke it to be their proper acte: sente for to saue & defende them, a thousande six houndred foote men, aswel of theyr citezins and subiectes yt went willingly, as also of mercenaryes or huyred men which had soulde or wages in the countrey of Peloponese, all wel armed, and foure houndred slightly armed.

The Athenyans than beyng aduertysed of the rebellyon of the Potydiens and of the succours that the Corynthyans had sent,Callias dyspatchedde Callia sonne of Calliadus and foure other Capytaynes in hys cō
                  panye wyth two thousande men for to go agaynste the sayde cytye of Potyde. who beynge aryued in Macedonie, founde that the people, that were furst cōme thyder, had taken the cytye of Therme,Therma. and helde the same of Pydue assieged,Pydua. & so they ioingned to them, that they toke it. but for the necessitie and desyre yt they had to go into Potyde, vnderstandynge that Aristeus was there arryued, they were constrayned to make appoynctemente and allyance wyth the sayde Perdicas. By meane wherof, they departed from Macedonye, and toke the waye strayght against Potyde. So they arryued at the porte of Berrye,Berrea. and thought to haue taken the towne at the arryualle. But seynge that they coulde not do it, they wente a lande, and marchedde strayght fourth agaynst Potyde. Hauyng in theyr hole armye thre thousande foote men, aswell of theyr people as of theyr cōfederates, and sixe houndred horse men Macedonyens. and more they had .lxx shyppes whiche came coastynge the lande. In suche manner, they iourneyed easely, that the thyrd day they arryued at the place of Grigrone,Gigonum. where they planted theyr campe. The Potydians and Aristeus with theyr people, vnderstandyng the commynge of the Athenyans, wente oute of the cytye, and came to sett theyr campe before the cytye of Olynthe,Olynthus. vpon the distrayct, kepyng theyr marcket wythoute the towne. And they all wyth one accorde dyd chose Aristeus to be Capytaine of the foote men, and Perdicas of the horsemen. who incontynentlye after the appoinctement made wyth the Athenyans, rebelled agaynste them, & had sente horsemen for to succoure the sayde Potydians, of whome he had geuē charge to Iolaus,Iolaus as hys lieutenant. Now the opynyon of Aristeus was to tary the Athenyans wt the bende, that he had in the sayde strayte, by the which mē muste of force passe, to come to Potyde by lande, yf they wolde comme thyder to assayle it. and that the Calcydes, wyth the other confederates, that were wtout the straycte, & also the horsemen of Perdicas, shulde tary within the towne of Olynthe. to the ende, that yf the Athenyans came to assaulte them, they shulde come fourthe to hys succour, and enclose the sayde Athenians at theyr backes. On the other syde Callia, Capytayne of Athenyens and hys compaignyons sent theyr horsmen Macedonyens that they had, with certayne nomber of footemē, before Olynthe for to kepe them, that were within, that they shulde not come fourth to succour the other. and they with the remaynant went directly agaīste Potyde. And when they were nygh to the straicte, seyng their ennemys, that prepared them selfe to fight, they put them selues lykewyse in order. and so came incontinently to the battayle. In the which, Aristeus and they that were with hī, aswell Corinthiens, as other all very good warryours, dyd dryue backe, & putt to flight the formerwarde of the ennemys, that came agaynst thē, & gaue them chase a long way
                     •
                   but the other poinct, where the Potydiens & the other Peloponesians were, was by the Athenyans vainquyshed & chased to the gates of the towne. Which seyng Aristeus, after that he was retourned fro the chase, was in great doubte, to which of two places he might retyre, to Potyde or to Olynthe. & fynally he determyned to wtdrawe himselfe with his people, yt he might ioigne agayne with hys wtin Potyde, for yt it was the nexte retrecte. So they went into the sea, which did beate the walles of the towne, & betwene the same and manye great stones, that were set afore, for to breake the wawes of the sea, they passed

through right great dangier of many throwes, that the enemys dyd cast agaīst them. wherby some of thē were slayne, but the more part entred into the towne. Nowe were come fourth to succour the Potydyans, they that were within Olynthe, which is situated in an high place, wythout the destrayte, distant frō the place, where the battaille was fought, aboutes six thousande pases. But the horsemen, Macedoniens, came agaynste thē to dryue thē backe. And after that they of the towne sawe, that the Atheniens hadde the victory, they retyred, & the Macedoniens lykewise towardes the Athenyans. And thus the horsemen, neyther of the one syde nor of the other, were not at the battayle. This done, the Athenians set vp their Trophee in tokē of victory, & rendred to the Potydyens theyr dead men according to the custome. which were founde well nygh, to the nōber of thre houndred, aswell of their citezeins, as of theyr allyes. and of the Athenyans aboutes the haluen deale. Among whom, was Callias one of theyr Capytaynes. That done, the Athenians closed the walles aboute with hydes towardes the destraicte, & sett their people there to kepe it. But they durst not go, and drawe theyr closure of the other quarter of the cytye of Potyde towardes Palene, which was ioingninge to the same towne of Potyde. althoughe that it were not walled on that syde, for that, that they were not in nōber to maigteigne two seges. and feared that yf they parted thēselues, they of the towne wolde comme to assaulte them, in the one or the other place. Whan the newes were signified at Athenes, howe Potyde was assieged by their people, but that they had not enuyroned Palene wt murage, they sent thyder within a lytle tyme after, six hoūdred men a freshe, vnder conducte of Phormyon,Phormio. sonne of Asopius.Alphi. who being departed from Aphite for to come towardes Palene, set hys people on lande, & wente fayre & well agaynste Potyde. Destroying and burnyng theyr feldes. And seing that none came fourthe of the towne, he closed Palene with a walle, by meane wherof the citie of Potide was assieged, and beaten on both sydes by lande, and also was assaulted on the sea syde, by meanes that the Athenyans had gottē the poorte. Aristeus, than seing that there was no more hope to be hable to defende the towne, yf no succour came from them of Peloponese, pretended that wt some good wynde yt might happen, all the people, that were wtin the towne, shuld be sente away, reserued sixe houndred (w
                     •
                  erof he wolde be one) the longer to s
                     •
                  
                  steigne the siege, vntyll some succour came vnto thē. For he feared, that victuailes shulde fayle thē. But seyng that he could not perswade that, he went fourthe in a night wtout knowlaige of the Athenians to geue order for that, yt was necessary, & to prouyde for other affayres, that were wtoute. & went to the Calcydes, by whose ayde, he dyd many exploictes of warre in the landes of the Athenians, & of their parties. And among other, being come to ronne before the citie of Sermypile, he had set an ambushement. by meanes whereof he slewe a great nōber of citezeins which came forth vpō him. And neuertheles he sollicited & laboured greatly the Peloponesians to sende hym some succour to Potyde. In this entrefeates or procedinges, Phormion, after that he had enclosed Potyde on al sides, came wyth sixe houndred men to ouerronne the countreys of Calcide and Beoce. and so toke some castells. Suche than were the quarells, betwene the Athenyans and Peloponesyans, for the Corynthyans were sorye, that the Athenyans had troubled the citie of Potide (which toke theyr part) and theyr Cytezeynes and other Peloponesians that were wythin. The Athenyans complayned that the Corynthyans had caused the Potydiens whiche were theyr subiectes to rebelle, and that they were come to theyr ayde for to defend them against them. But the warre was not yet fully declared. so that there was some respitt, for that the questyon was not yet generallye agaynste all the Peloponesians,

but onely agaynste the Corinthiens. who alwayes fearynge the losse of Potyde and of theyr people that were within, dyd not cease to practyse theyr allyes, to come with them towardes the Lacedemonyens. whiche were theyr heade, to make theyr complayntes agaynste the Athenyans, as breakers of the peace, and ennemys to all the Peloponesians. whiche they dyd. And on the other syde, the Agenytes came thyder not publiquely and openly, for they durste not for feare of the Athenyans, but secretely, they perswaded warre, as the other dyd. For that that they complayned, that the Athenyans wolde not suffre them to enioye their lybertye, as it was
appoynted by the sayde treatye of peace. when all the Ambassadours of the confederated townes, whiche were comme for thys matter, were arryued at Lacedemonye, the Lacedemonyens assembled theyr counsayle, and caused it to be declared wyth loude voyce, that yf there were any parsonne that pretended to make any complaincte agaynst the Athenyans, he shulde speake publiquely, as the custome was. At whiche admonytion came before them almost all the confederates of Peloponese, makynge theyr complainctes and doleances. And besydes them, the Megarens. who complayned for that, that beynge vnder the seigniorye of the Athenyans, they had prohybited them to vse marchaundyse in theyr porte, & in theyr terrytorye. The Corinthians were the laste, for they suffred the other to speake before, of a sett purpose, for to prouoke and get the Lacedemonyans, and afterwardes they spake in this manner.
            
            
               ¶The narration and proposition of the Corinthians in the Counsaylle of Lacedemonye, agaynste the Athenyans. The .vii. Chapter.
               THe fayth and loyaultie, that youe kepe amonge you, aswell in commun, as in particuler (Lordes Lacedemonyās) maketh, that yf any the other of vs shulde saye any thynge agaynste you, that no man wolde beleue hym. And in that, youre modestye and loyaultie causeth youe to be esteamed. But youe vse one greate ignoraunce, touchynge thynges that be wythoute. For albeit, that we haue often shewed and preached, howe the Athenyans woulde ouercomme and oppresse vs, yet woulde you neuer beleue vs, but that, that they, that shewed it vnto youe, sh
                     •
                  lde saye it, by meanes of particuler questyons, that they had with them. and by meane therof wolde not assemble your allyes, before that we were oultraged & wronged. But youe haue forborne vntyll thys presente,, that we be iniuryed. And therfor it is very reasonable that in presence of youre sayde allyes and confederates, we make the longer proposityon, for so much as we be dowbly offended. to wytt, by the Athenyans that haue oultraged vs, and by youe that haue not regarded it. And yf there were any reasone, whereby a man myght defende, that it were no
                     •
                   holye notoryous, that the Athenyans be they, whiche trouble all Grece: It were requysitt that we shulde cause it to appere vnto them, that knowe it not. But what nedeth nowe to holde any longer purpose of it, sythens that youe may see, the one brought into the seruitude by the Athenians, & the other sharply assaulted. & specyally they, yt be your allyes. whom of a long saisone, they haue imagyned to wtdrawe vnto them, for to serue & ayde thē agaynst vs in time of warre.

Truly, if warre were made agaynst thē. Certaynly they haue for none other purpose occupyed Corcyre, nor now do holde potyde assiged. wherof the one, to witt, Corcyre shulde fournyshe the Peloponesians with greate nomber of shyppes, & the other ys very propice, for the affayres of Thrace. For the whych thinges you arne to be blamed. For that, that from the begynnynge, whan the warre of the Medes was fynyshed, you suffred them to make thair cytie agayne. And afterwardes, moreouer to increase yt wyth greate walles. And successiuely from that tyme vnto this presente daye, haue tolerated and suffred them to depriue from lybertye and putt into bondage, not thair allyes onely: but also ours. How beyt it may well be sayde, that it is youe, that haue done it. For the mysdeede is more attrybuted vnto him that suffreth it to be donne, where as he may lett or withstande yt: than to hym that doth yt. And pryncypally to youe, that beare ye praise and the tytle to be defendours of the lybertie of Grece. And yet neuerthelas with great payne, youe haue nowe caused the assemblye to be made. And wol not take the thynges to be certayne, that be holy not orious. But youe wolle that we shal declare by what meanes we be iniuried, where as it is necessary to deliberate but only, howe we
                     •
                   shulde reuenge vs of the wronges, whyche hath be donne vnto vs. For in this, that the Athenyans dyd not comme agaynste vs to oultrage vs atoones, but by lytle and lytle, although they yet knowe not of thys assemblie. they do it not wythout cause. But we perceue very welle, that it is for that, that they thynke that so doynge, that youe shulde not parceue yt through the slackenes and for bearyng, whyche they knowe to be in youe. whyche thynge you shuld easely do, if they executed al at ones that, whych they haue enterprysed. But whā they shall see that you vnderstande and passe not on yt, they wol execute yt much more boldely and wyth greater force. Nowe, lordes Lacedemonians, youe arne they only, that be in reste. and woll not resiste violēces by force, but by lēgth of tyme. nor abate the strengthe of your enemys whā they begynne to increase, but tary, vntyll they be dowbled. And thys ys not only now, that youe haue had this custome. For we all do knowe, that the Medes, that came frome the worldes ende agaynste you, werein your lande bifore youe had made prouisions, that you might & onght to haue done bifore, for your honnour & suertie. And now you lett at nought the Athenyans, whyche be not farre from youe, but euene youre neyghbours. and youe loue better, that they shuld come to assayle youe, thā furst to inuade them. and by thys meane, to put your selfe in hazart of the warre, whā they shalbe much more stronger than they were. Truly youe ought well to consyder that the victory, whyche we had agaynst the stranger, kynge of Medes, was in a great parte through hys faulte. And chiefly the Athenyans, whan they had warre agaynst vs, were vaynquyshed more by thair errours that they committed, than by our valyantnes. And also youe ought to remēber that some of ours, trustynge to your ayde and fauour, were taken and destroyed. and thynke not that we speake thies thinges for hatred that we haue agaynste the sayd Athenyans by manner of quarellinge. For it is the parte of a frēde, to his frende, that he sheweth hys quarell or playncte whan one doth that to an othere. whyche he ought not to do. but it is by manner of accusation that we complayne of the iniuries, that our ennemys hath donne to vs. And truly, if there be any people in the worlde, to whome it is laufull to complayne themselues and to sorowe for thair allyes and confederates, we arne they, as we thinke. marked specially, that we do fyght for so greate quarelles, and for thynges of so greate ymportance. wherof, as it semeth to vs, you haue no regarde. and woll not consyder, that we haue to do agaynste the Athenyans, whyche be your ennemys, and people, that

seke alwayes nouuelties. and also be subtyll to studye oute meanes to increase themselues, and diligent to execute them. but as touchynge you, you thinke that it is suffycient to kepe togider that, that you haue, wythoute to enterpryse any thynge. and also be negligent to execute, though that necessitie requyre it. And by thys meane we see, that they haue greater audacyte, than force, so that they put themselues into many greate daungers againste opynion of the people, and neuertheles whatsoeuer harde thinge that they enterpryse, they haue good hope to execute yt. but your harte ys much lessar to enterpryse, than your force, for to execute yt. wherby it chaunceth, that in enterpryses, that be wythout dāger, you put doubte. & you neuer thinke that you arne longe inough out of busynes. furthermore they be diligente and you neglygence. They go contynually fourth of thair countrey, and you arne restfull in yours. for they thinke that thair voyages do welrecompense thair absence. but whan you go out of your countrey, you thinke that that, whyche you le
                     •
                  e behynd youe, ys loste. They, whan they haue vainquished thair enemy, do poursue thair victories at lengthe. and whan they are ouercomed, they lose not one iote of couraige. And furthermore in prouiding for thinges, whyche cōcerne the weale of thair cytie, they vse thair wytts & counsayle, as it were for thair owne cause. but as for thair bodyes, they sett them of & haband onne them, as if they were of strange people, whome they knewe not. And whan they fayle to execute any enterpryse, they thinke that they haue loste somuche of thair owne. And also whan they haue gotten any thynge it semeth to them to be very lytle in regarde of that, that they thought it to be. And if they alsayed to do any thinge, wherof they had bene frustrated of thair hope, they parforced themselfe to recouer suche losse, by some newe enterpryse. And I thynke in effecte, that they and none other haue and hope togiders the thinge, that they enterpryse. so diligent be they to execute thair enterprises. Also in all thies thinges they vse thair lyfe, and all thair age, in labours and in daungers, withoute muche enioyinge the thynges that they haue gottonne, for the contynual desire, that they haue to gett other. And they thinke that there was no feaste nor other thynge so playsante, as that, in whiche they executed the thynge, whiche they enterprysed. and that the repose, that men take through necligence, ys more dammageable to the parsone, than laborious exercise. in such sort that it may be wel said (to cōprehend all in fewe wordes) that they be borne wt such wytt, that they cannot be in rest, nor suffer other to rest. Having than one such a cytie your ennemye, you slepe, lordes Lacedemoniēs. and thinke that they may well reste, who, whan it is necessary) execute vertuously. & geue to vnderstād, that if any woulde oultrage them, they haue the harte to resiste. And youe mesure youre modestie & equitie, with no wille to do euille to an othere. and to reuenge youe, whan men would do it. whyche thynge youe shall skarcely do whan you haue to do with a cytie your neyghbour, whych shalbe equall wyth yours. And nowe you woll, as we haue bifore declared, lyue & be conuersant with the Athenians accordinge to thair aunciēt māners & customes. but it is necessary to haue regard to ye thinges newe & presente in this case, as in all other busynes. For as it is right conueniēt for a cytie, that ys in rest & peace, not to change hys lawes & auncyent customes, right so, for that, whyche is oppressed with affaires by an other. It is necessary to thinke on many newe thynges. And to Imagynne many craftes for to resiste. & it is the cause, wherby the Athenyans be alwayes inclyned to enterprise new thinges, muche more than we, for the greate experience that they haue. wherfore, lordes, it is nedefull that henceforwardes, youe cease youre prolonging and slackenes, & that youe succour your frendes, specially those, that be at Potyde as we

haue vnderstanded. And entre with diligence into the landes of the Athenyans. and suffer not your frendes and parentes to fall into the hande of your mortall ennemys, nor also that we the other, be constrayned through despayre, to seke other allyaunce than yours, whyche we may well do in thys case, wythout to be reprehended of the goddes, by whome we haue made othe, or also of men, that shall vnderstande the reasone, wherfore we shall haue done yt. For they that departe from thair allyes, beinge by them forsakenne, arne not to be reputed breakers of faythe. but worthely those, whyche haue denyed them succour, whyche if ye do fourthwith delyuer vs, we wyll parseuer in the faythfulnes, that we owe youe. For doinge otherwyse, we shulde be vnhappy, and also coulde not recouer it of other people, that haue, as greatly, biloued vs. Upō whych thynges it may please youe to take good counsayle and good deliberation. and so 
                     •
                  o do, that yt may not be not sayde, that you gouerne the countrey of Peloponese wyth iesser dygnytie and reputation, than your parentes dyd, that haue lefte youe thys gouernance. In this manner, spake the Corinthians. Nowe were than in the cytie of Lacedemonie, certayne Ambassadours of the Athenyans, whyche were sente thider longe bifore, for other matters. Who, vnderstandyng thies complainctes and practises, denised, that it was expedyēt for thair honnor to go towardes the Senate of the cytie, not for to aunswere to the complainctes, that were made agaynst the Athenyans: but for to shewe them in generall, that they oughte not to determyne vpon those thynges, bifore they had furst well digested them. and to do them to vnderstande the strengthe of thair sayd cytie, bringinge to remembrance of the auncyent men the thynges, whyche they knewe, and doynge the yonge men do vnderstande those thynges, wherof they had yet no experience. For they thought well, that, whan the Lacedemonyans had vnderstande thaire declarations, they wolde be more enclyned to maigntaigne the peace, and rather contynue i
                     •
                   reste, than to begynne the warre. For this they sayde vnto the lordes of the counsaylle, that they had come matter to shewe them, if it were thair plaisirs, who gaue them audyence. And they did speake in this manner.
            
            
               The narration of the Ambassabassadours Athenians to the Counsaylle of the Lacedemonyans. ☞The .viii. Chapter.
               WE be not cōme into this towne, lordes Lacedemonyās, for to debate wyth our allyes, but we were here for other matters, as ye do know. yet vnderstandyng the complaynctes, that the othere cyties do make agaynste ours, we be willinge to presente and declare, not for to aunswere, againste the charges that they lay vnto vs (for also you arne not our iudges betwene vs and them) but to the entente, that you credite not lyghtly that, whyche they say agaynst vs, and for thair parsuation determyne slightly in this matter, (whyche is of so greate importance) otherwyse, than is requisitt. and also for that, that we woll well informe youe of our affaires and dedes, as they bee, and that the same, whyche we holde, we haue laufully gottoneyt. And furthermore that our cytie ys suche, that yt ought to be estemed. And wythout rehersynge the thynges so auncyent, that men haue more knowlaige therof by comon fame and renomme, than by true scyence: we wol speake of them that were

doone in the warre of the Medes, wherof youe haue true knowlaige. althoughe that it be noysome and molestuous to repete it often tymes, yet it is necessary nowe to do it. And also it that, whyche we than did at our great danger, redoundeth to the comon weale of all Grece (wherof youe haue bene parttakers) men shulde not be asshamed to shewe it, not somuche for to excuse and iustifie oure selues of the thinges that arne layde to vs, as for to do youe to vnderstande with what cytie, you shall haue to do, if that through euill counsaille, you enterprise the warre. For 
                     •
                  urste it is very certayne, that we onely wente bifore the straungers in danger of oure lyues at Marathonie. And afterwardes, whan they came agayne the seconde tyme, seinge that we were not myghtie inoughe to goo to fyght wyth them by lande, we wente to encounter them by sea wyth all our shippes, and vainquished them at Salamyne. whych victorie letted them, that they wente not to pillage and fourraige all your townes and cyties of Peloponese. whyche they might easely haue donne, consyderinge that they coulde not succour the one the other agaynste 
                     •
                  one so mightie an armye by sea, as they hadde. The whyche thynge, the Barbarous kynge did well than declare. For beinge by vs ouercommed by sea, and knowynge that he coulde neuer assemble one suche a puyssance, he retourned wyth the greater partie of his hooste. by whyche dede, being fully clere and notorious, that the force of Grece, consisted in the armye by Sea, we fournished than thre thinges, vtile and profytable for all Grece. To wytt, greate nomber of shyps, a Capytayne ryght wyse and diligente, and a harte obedyent and coragious. For as touchinge the shippes, we hadde lytle lesse than foure houndredde, whych were two partes of the hole armye. Concerninge the Capytayne, we gaue youe Themistocles, whiche was principal author and mouer, that the battaile was made in the discreate of the sea, which without all doubte, was the saufgarde of Grece. By occasyon whereof, youe iudged vnto hym singular honors, more than to any other estrangier, that euer came vnto youe. And as for the couragiousnes of harte, we shewed yt very openly. For seing that we had not any succour by lande, for that, that the ennemys had lately gayned all that, whyche was bifore vs, we determyned to leaue our cytie, and to destroye our houses, and to loose our particular goodes, (not for to habandonne and forsake our frēdes and allyes and to disperse ourselues into dyuers places, which if we had done, we had not done them any saruice) but we went fourth to serche the dangers vpon the Sea, wythoute hauinge regarde or shewinge any grudge againste you, for that, that ye came not to succoure vs in tyme of nede. wherfore we may well say for trouth, that we were as profitable than vnto you, as you vnto vs. For youe, that kepte stille the townes inhabyted and therin had your goodes and your wyues and childrenne, fearing to lose them, came to our ayde, not somuche for vs, as for yourselues. For if you hadde mynded to haue done for vs, youe shulde haue come thider bifore oure cytie had bene habandoned and destroyed. but as touchynge vs in forsakyng our towne, (whiche nowe had no more fourme of a cytie) for to succour yours than, whan it had no great apparance to saue yt selfe, we were well wyllinge to cōmyt and putt ourselues into the dangers of the sayd warres. and by thys meane was cause, for a greate parte, of your saulftie and of ours. where, if we had bene mynded to submit ourselues vnto the kynge of Mede, as many other countreis did, fearynge to be destroyed: or after that we had habandoned our cytie, had not had the hardynes to take the seas, but as people faynte harted, had wythdrawen our ourselnes into sure places: truly ye durst not haue comme bifore the ennemy with so smal nomber of shyppes, as youe than hadde, wherupon by that meane, youe shulde haue

bene constrayned to haue done, as he wolde, wythout any faightinge. Nowe semeth it not vnto youe, lordes Lacedemonyans, that for thys our hardynes and prudence, we be wel worthy to haue and obtaigne the principalitie & seigniory, whiche we nowe haue? Whyche ought not to be enuyed nor molested by Grece, for that, that we gott yt not by force: but partly by pursuyng the ennemyes, whiche you woulde not do, and partly at requeste of some of our allyes, that came to praye vs that we wolde take them into oure protection and gouernance. By meanes wherof, we haue bene constrayned to consarue and encrease our principalitie from that tyme vntyll this presente, furste for feare, afterwardes for honnour, and fynally for proffytt. And seinge also that we we enuyed of many people, and that some of our subiectes and confederates, be lately rebelled againste vs, whome we haue subdewed and chastised, yea and that youe arne moued to departe from our amytie and haue some suspition againste vs, we shulde not be well counsailled to desiste from our trauayle, but we shulde putt ourselues into greate daungier. Fo they, that shulde departe from our obeysance, shuld come vnder yours. wherefore no man is to be blamed, if in thynges, wherin he parceyueth greate danger, he prouydeth for his indempnyte. And youe, lordes Lacedemonyens, do not you gouerne for your profitte the cyties of Pelopone
                     •
                  e? And if youe had contynued in your Empyre from the warre of the Medes vntil this present, youe shulde haue bene both enuyed (as we be) of straūgers, and also molestuous and rigorous to youre subiectes. And of force, youe shulde aither haue bene blamed to haue bene to farre imperiall and rygorous to youre subiectes, or ells haue bene constrayned to put your estate into dangier. And therfore if that we haue taken and consarued the rule and superiorite, that hath bene geuen vs, we haue done no newe thynge, nother that, that ys contrary to humayne lawes and customes. And also there be thre great thinges, that defende vs to leue and forsake yt, to wytt, the honnor, the feare, and the proffytte. And of the other parte, we arne not the inuentours and authors of suche thinge, for it was neuer otherwyse, but that the more weake were constrayned to obey vnto the stronger. And we be well woorthy and do merytt so to do in our iudgement, and also by yours, if you woll egally consider, both proffit and reason. For no man woll prefarre reason somuche bifore proffit, that if any hōnest occasion be offred hym to obteigne aduantage by force, that he woll lett yt slippe. And they be to be praysed, that in vsynge and administringe right, be of nature more bening and gracious in thair gouernement, than the rule & ryght of gouerning requyreth, lyke as we do. And if our Empier came into other mens handes, we thinke, that they shulde better parceue yt. Althoughe that for this oure bountie and gentlenes, we gett more reproche, than prayse. whych is a thinge very vnresonable. For, for that, that we vse the selfe lawes in our contractes and in oure iudgementes with our subiectes. whyche we vse amonge our selues (besides this that it is a thynge contumelious and shamefull for vs) yet they repute vs to be playdors and contentious. And there is not one among thē, that consydereth, that there ys not any people in the worlde, that more gētly entreate thair subiectes, thā we do. And also men do not obey to other, that be playdours, as men do vnto vs. For it is laufull for them. to vse force against thair subiectes, whyche be intierly thair obeissantes. wherfore it is not for them to come therto by iudgement nor proces. But concerninge ours, for the libertye, whyche they haue bene accustomed to haue with vs and to be egall wyth vs in iustice, if a man do them wronge in any thinge by deede or by woorde, be it for neu
                     •
                  r so small a matter, for the opynion that they haue in the rightuousnes of oure gouernance
                     •
                   and that

it shulde not be taken from them: they not only be not thankefull to vs, for that the remanant was lefte vnto them, that men might haue taken from them, by force: but also they take yt for more displeasure to lose that lytle of thair good, than if at the begynnynge we had vtterly captyued them to our wille, and vsed towardes them violence, & not iustyce. And yet in this case they durste not ones haue murmured or grudged, but being our subiectes by wylle, they would haue thought it a great offence to disobey vs. For we see euydētly that the people take it to be more greuous and are more angry, whan they be wronged, than whan they be forced. Also whā a mā speketh to defraude one, or to do hym wrong, it is sayde, that the iustyceys comone: but whan a man speaketh of constrayninge, it is vnderstanded that there is a superiour, vsinge wille. Of this cometh yt, that they, whych presently be our subiectes, whan they were in subiection of the Medes, indured paciently thair Empyre, and now ours semeth vnto thē to be harde. But to a discrete parsone, this is no maruaile. For al subiectes do alwayes cō
                  playne of the seignyorie, that is presente. And if your selfe had changed our Empire and shuld rule our subiectes: truly the benyuolence that youe shuld gett of them for the feare, that they haue of vs, shulde tourne into euyll wille or displeasure. if youe wolde kepe the trayne and shewe yourselues of the sorte, that youe declared in that lytle tyme, that ye had the gouernance of all Grece, in the warre of the Medes. For youe do not comunycate your lawes and youre customes to othere. And moreouer whosoeuer is sente by youe to be Duke or Capytayne in any armye, he vseth not other manners, than he was wonted to bifore. Nor such, as all the remenant of Grece doth vse, but by all facyōs doth make strange particularites and differente frō other. wherfore, lordes, vouchesaulf to cōsider, that the matters wherof ys question, be waightie and of greate importance. And be well worthy to be longe consulted vpon. And geue not somuche faythe to the connsaille and accusacyōs of the other people, that you take this charge so great, vpon youe. But thinke well before the begynning of thys warre, of what importance it is, and the daungers that may chaunce. For by lengthe or contynuance of warre, happenne many hazardes. From whyche, we yet arne clere, bothe youe and we. But whan it shalbe bigoune, yt is not knowin, vpon whiche of vs they shall fall. Also it is certayne, that they that be to desirous and hasty to begynne warre, do peruerte the order of reasone. For they begynne by execution and by force. whyche shulde be laste, after that it were well consulted. whyche faulte no man shall fynde in vs, and also we see not, that it is yet in youe. For this cause, whiles the thinges be entier and hole, we woll well admonishe youe, that youe take good aduise, nother to breake the peace, nor to falsefie your othe. And if there be any difference betwene vs, let vs auoide yt by the manner conteigned in oure sayd treatie of peace. Orells we protest, and take to wytnes, ye goddes, by whom we haue sworne, that yf you be the Authors of the warre, we wol pursue yt vnto the ende. Thus dyd the Athenyans speake. And after that the Lacedemonians had harde aswel the complayntes of the Peloponesians, as the declaracyons of the sayde Athenians, they caused them all to go fourthe, and put the matter into deliberacion amonge them selues. So the more parte of them, were of opinion, that the Athenians dyd wronge and that it was expedient to moue war against them wythout longer tariyng. Whiche parceyuyng the kynge Archidamus, who was taken to be a wyse man and of clere vnderstandinge, stoode vp, and did speake in this manner.
            
            
               
               The narration and proposition of Archidamus kinge of the Lacedemonyans. The .ix. Chapter.
               I Haue experimented many warres, lordes Lacedemonyans, and also I knowe that there be many amonge youe that be in suche age, that they wolde not counsaille to warre, by imprudency and rashly, as yt chauncethe to many, and also wolde not repute warre to be a thynge suer nor good. And if we consyder this same, wherof questyon ys presently had, we shall not take yt to be smalle. For if question were to make warre agaynste the Peloponesians our neighbours, our strength shulde be lyke vnto thairs. For that, that we might leade our armye subdainly agaynste euery of them. But to make warre againste them, that be farre from vs, and that be greatly experymented in the sea, and fournished habundantly of all thinges necessary, to wytt, of ryches, aswell in particuler, as in comone, of shippes, of horses, of harnnes & of people, asmuche and more, than any othere cytie of Grece, and also haue moreouer many allyes, trybutours vnto them, howe shulde we enterpryse yt or vpon what hope? Consydering that we arne vnprouyded of all thynges to assayle them fourthwith. For if the question be of an armye by sea, we arne much more weake thā they, so be we of siluer, for that ye we haue none in general, nor meane to recouer it by and by, of particulars. Some do trust peraduēture, that we arne more puyssante than they in the feate of warre. And that we haue more people. By meane wherof we may easely ouerrunne and waste thair landes. But yt muste be consydered that whan we shall haue well wasted thair territorye, they haue much other landes elleswhere. And also they haue the Sea, whyche shall furuyshe thē alwayes of that, that shalbe necessary for them. And whan we shal haue practised and caused thair subiectes and allyes to rebell, they muste be succurred by sea. For that the more parte ys inhabytinge in the Islandes. And therfore, what manner warre shall ours be? Consideryng that if we be not stronger than they in the sea, or that we take not from thē y• revenues, wherwyth they do furnishe the charge of thair shippes, we shall destroy more of oure landes, than of thairs. And also we may not afterwardes departe with oure honnoure frome warre, specyally beinge thauthours of yt. And we oughte not to hope that by hauynge pyllaiged and wasted thaire landes, we haue the sonner fynished the warre. But I feare rather that in this doing, we leue yt vnto oure children. For it is not to bileue that the Athenyās haue to small harte, that for seing thair terrytorie wasted, that they woll render them subiectes vnto vs, or that they be so afrayde of warre, as if they did not knowe what it is. And yet notwithstandinge I am not so destytute of wytte that I woll counsaile youe to suffer your frendes & allies to be iniuryed. And that youe cause not the wronge and deceytes of the sayd Athenyans to be parceyued. But I saye truly that youe ought not yet, to take armure and make warre agaynste them. But youe shulde sende towardes them, and sommon them to do right. Shewinge them, that we be not minded to suffre suche thinges. And that rather we woll fyght, than indure them, wythout alwayes to shewe that we be to soore chased to beginne the warre. And in the meane tyme, we maye prepare our case, drawinge to our amytie newe people, aswell Grekes, as straungers from all parties. Whereby we maye haue ayde of shippes and of monney. For yt is lawfull for them, that by thaire allyes be euill

handeled, (as we be by the Athenyans) to take allyaunce, and to make amytie with all people, for to saulfe and to kepe thaire estate. And also we maye in the meane tyme assemble oure particuler forces. And if they obey vnto the demandes that our Ambassadours shall make vnto them, it shalbe a right good thing. And if they do it not, we shall haue, (by puttinge this practique in vse) two or thre yeares space, for to fournishe vs of that, that ys nedefull. And we may afterwardes, if we thinke good, begynne the warre. And whan they shall see our preparation to be suffycient for to execute that, whyche we shall haue signefied vnto them: they shalbe more enclyned to obey vs. And specially, hauynge thair terrytorie intier and not wasted. For that, shall cause questyon for to determyne, how they shal saue thair goodes, bifore they be pilledged by thair ennemys. And I do thynke, that we shulde repute and holde that same thair territorye (so long as it shall be entier in thair handes) as for a sure hostage or pledge. And somuch the more, as it shalbe the better labored. By reasone whereof, we ought willingly to cōsarue or saue it For by destroying yt, we shulde cause them through dispayer to bicome inexpugnable and not to be ouercome. And if, bifore we be prouyded and furnyshed, we do waste the sayde landes at the desyre of oure confederates, and by meane of thair accusations, I feare greately that we shall prouyde
                     •
                   very euill for the feates of them of Peloyonese. And that it redoundethe to thair greate dammage and dishonnor, for that, that suche accusations, be they comone or particuler, may well be appaised. But a warre, that shall begynne by all vs the other in generall, at the desyre and for the complainctes of some particulers, maye not easely be lefte of, with oure honnoure. And also we knowe not what ye end therof shalbe. And if it semeth to any, that it is for lacke of harte, that many cyties confederated dare not enterpryse fourthwith warre agaynste one only cytie: Consyder, that they haue of allyes so many as we, and those, whyche they haue, be thair cōtrybutours. and so be not ours, Cōsyder also that to maigteigne warre, it is as necessary to haue monney to paye the charges, as to haue people and harnois, whiche be vnprofitable, if there be not wherewith to enterteigne them. And specially for people of mayne lande, against thē by Sea. wherfore lett vs furste take order for the expences, and lett vs not feare for the wordes of our allyes. For truly, like as the yll or goodnes that shall chaunce, shalbe more imputed vnto vs, than vnto them, so oughte we to foresee & consider with greate leasure, to what ende the thynges maye growe. And you ought not to take for reproche and shame, the prolonginge & slackenes that they charge vs with. For if youe be to hasty to begynne warre, bifore youe be prouyded, yt shall indure somuch the longer. And for that, y• our cytie hath alwaies bene frāke & right glorius, yt may wel be sayd that this prolonging & deliberation haue euer be ioyned with our grauitie. By meane wherof, we alone & none other, do not lyfte vp oure selues by pryde in our prosperities, & in our aduersites do shewe oureselues lesse astonied, thā any other. And also we be not moued lightly by praisings or perswasyōs of other, to enterpryse thinges, yt we knowe to be ryght difficile, nor likewise by rebukes & reproches. And in effect we be by meanes of this sobernes both good warryons, and also sage & well aduysed. To wytt, good warryours, for somuche as of tha
                     •
                   sobrenes procedeth shamefas
                     •
                  nes & feare of shame, & of that cometh hardynes. Also we be sage & well aduised, for that, y• we be so taught & instructed fro our yougth, not to presume to be so wyse, as to be bolde to contēpne & transgresse our lawes, and to shewe our modestie, rather by induring thair rigour, thā in disobeing thē. And moreouer we sett not greatly our study on vayne and vnprofitable thinges, as to despyse and abate by greate narrations & stif woordes,

that be nothing to purpose, ye force and puyssance of our ennemys. or to perswade lightly to begynne warre, as though here were no othere thyng to do. But we haue the prudence to thinke, that the fantasie of men that arne not exceadynge farre from vs, ys lyke vnto ours, and that the hazardes of warre be not comprised in narrations of many woordes. Wherfore we ought alwayes to geue order to our busynes in effecte, and not by woordes, and to presuppose that we haue to do with suche ennemys, as vse good counsell. And not to putt our confydence in faultes, that may be made, but to presume, that they prouyde aswell for thair affayres, as we for ours, & that there ys not greate difference bitwene one man & an other, but that same ys most wyse and most estemed, that shewithe beste his knowlaige at nede. Haue wille therfore (lordes Lacedemonyās) to kepe and enterteigne this forme of lyuynge, whyche your auncesters haue lefte youe. By folowynge wherof, we ourselues haue alwayes proffyted and prospered. And let vs not suffer ourselues to be perswaded, to consulte and determyne in a momēt of tyme, of the lyues and faculties of greate nombere of people, of greate expences, and defrayinge of monney, of many townes and cyties, and of our glory and reputacion. But all at leasure aduyse youe what youe haue to do. For we haue better occasion to tary than any of the other, by reasone of our force. And for cō
                  clusion myne aduyse is, that we shall sende towardes the Athenyās, for to shew them declarations touchynge Potyde, and the other complaynctes & querells, that arne made agaynste them. And somuche the rather, that they offer themselues to stande to iudgemente, by whyche thair doinge, we may not reasonably go agaynste them, as oultragious & enforcers. And neuerthelas may in the meane tyme prouyde vs of thinges necessary for the warre. For by this meane, you shal both prouyde sagely for your affayres, and also put your ennemys in great feare. Thus spake Archidamus. And after that many other had spokenne, in the laste place arose vp Stenelaides,Steneleidas who was for that tyme, one of the Trybuns of the people, that they call Ephores, and he did speake in this manner.
            
            
               The narration and proposition of Stenelaydes, by folowinge wherof, warre was concluded agaynst the Athenyans. The .x. Chapter.
               TRuly, lordes, I cannot vnderstande, what the Athenyans will to say by the longe talke, wherwith they haue kepte vs here, for they haue done nothinge but highly praised and sett fourth thair puyssance and thair dedes, without excusinge themselfe in any manner of the iniuries and oultrages, that they haue done to oure allyes and to hole Peloponese. And if they were good againste the Medes, somuch arne they double more worthy of punyshment, to be euill against vs, nowe beyng bicome yll, frō good. But as touchynge vs, and them that be lyke vnto vs, truly we be holy suche, as we haue bene in tymes passed. And if we be wyse, we woll not despise our allyes that be oultraged, nother woll we delaye to succour them, seinge that men delaye not to oultrage theyme. And though the other haue more monney: more shippes and more horses than we: we yet also haue good allyes and valyaunte, that desarue not to be forsakē & left to the Atheniās, nother that we shuld not redresse thair cōplaintes, for proces nor for wordes, cōsydering yt they be oultraged

by dede and not by woordes. But we ought to fyght agaynste them fourthwith and that with all our power. And it is not nedefull that any man teach vs, how we shulde consulte and deliberate in this case, seing that we be thus oultraged. For it is for them, that are mynded to wronge other, conuenyent, to make thies longe consultations. And therefore, lordes Lacedemonyans, iudge manfully and declare warre, in shewynge and defendinge youre dygnitie and maiestye Spertayne. And suffre ye not, that the Athenyans make theirs more greate, nor to destroy oure allyes. But hauinge the goddes to helpe vs, lette vs warre againste them, that do iniurie vs. After that Stenelaides hadde thus spoken, he sayde and ordonned that the matter shulde be putte into deliberation of the counsayle, to be determyned by ye greater voyce. And for that, that the noyse was greate amongest them, for the diuersyte of opynyons (for thair custome was to declare and geue thair consente and opynyo
                     •
                  s by thair voyces and not by small balles) for to encourage them the more to be of his oyynyō, he sayd in this manner. All those that be of opynyon, that the Athenyans haue brokenne the allyances and wrōged our frendes: aryse & withdrawe yourselues into this place. shewinge them a certayn place of the halle, where they helde counsaile. And they that shalbe of contrary opynyon, withdrawe youreselfe into the othere. whiche they did. So there was founde a muche greater nomber of them, that were of the opynyon, to make warre. This done, they caused thair allyes to be called, and shewed them, that they thought that the Athenyans did wronge. But neuerthelas bifore they wolde determyne warre, they were mynded to haue the aduyse and opynyon of them all, to thintent that if it were mete to make it, the same shuld be done by one comon accorde. And hereupon they sente all the Ambassadours that were there, home to thair houses for to consulte euery of them in his quartier. And lykewyse the Athenyans, after they had receiued auuswere of that, that they were sente for, they retourned to Athenes. And this peblic

                   decre of the people, was made and pronounced the .xiiii. yeare after the truyse of thirty yeares, whyche had bene made after the warre of Eubee. And the Lacedemonyans were moued to make this decre, not somuche for the woordes and declarations of thair allyes, as for feare that they had, that the Athenyās shulde make themselues mightier. Seinge that the more parte of Grece, was now subjected vnto them. And they were encreased sens the warre of the Medes, in the manner that foloweth.
            
            
               Howe the Ath

                  nyans after the warre of the Medes, buylded agayne theire cytie, and the begynnynge of thair Empyre in Grece. The .xi. Chaptre.
               AFter that the Medes were departed from Europe, beinge vainquisshed by the Grekes, aswell by lande, as by sea, and that they, that were saued by sea, were descomforted nigh to Mycale: Lyothichides king of Lacedemonyans,Micales Leotychides. (who was Duke and Capytaine to the Grekes, that were at the same descomfyture of Mycale) retourned home wyth the Grekes of Peloponese, that he had vnder hym. But the Athenyans wyth them of Ionum, and of Hellespont, whyche than were rebelles agaynste the kynge of Mede, taried and assieged the cytie fo Ceste,Sestus whiche the same Medes did holde, who did forsake it. And by that meane, the same Athenyans and allyes toke yt,

and there kepte thair winter. The wynter passed, they all departed frome Hellesponte, the countrey beynge habandoned of the strangers, and the Athenyans wente to take agayne thair wyues chyldren and moueables that were in the cyties, wherin they had bestowed them to be kept, at the begynning of the warre. After, they retourned vnto Athenes, & determyned to make agayne and buylde thair walles of the towne, the more parte wherof were beaten downe. And likewyse the howsen. some of them in very small nomber resarued. whiche the chiefe of the straungers had kepte for to lodge in. Whyche thinge vnderstandynge the Lacedemonyans, they sente thair Ambassadours to empesche and lette them to doyt. Aswell for that, that they not wyllingly did see, that they nor other shulde haue walles to thair townes, as also at the instigatiō of thair allyes, that feared the puyssance of the same Athenyans, seing that they had a muche more greate nomber of shippes, that at begynning of the warre. And that sens the same, they had conceyued a great audacytie. So the sayd Ambassadours requyred thē that they wolde not make agayne thair walles, but rather plucke downe all those of the other townes, that were out of Peloponese, that remayned hole. And yet not withstandynge did not declare vnto them the cause that moued them to make this requeste: but shewed thē that it was for feare that if they made again thair sayd walles, & the straungers shulde retourne, they shulde haue an other place to receyue them, wherin they myght warre agaynste them, as they did than in the cytie of Thoebes, whyche they did holde. For they sayde, that Peloponese was a place sure and defensible, suffyciēt for the retreate of all the Grekes. Whan the Athenyans had harde this Ambassade, they aunswered that they wolde shortly sende of thair people to Lacedemonye for to make them aunswere. And with this answere sent thē again incontynently. And this they did by the counsaille of Themistocles, who perswaded them, that they shulde sende him fourthwyth bifore into Lacedemonye, and that within certayn tyme after, they shulde despatche other people, that shuld haue charge of that matter with him, & in the meane tyme shuld cause with all diligence to be sett to worke all thē of the towne, aswel lytle, as great, & aswell men, as also women, to make the walles for to rayse thē by all meanes to be so high, that they might be fensible, and that they shuld take the matter and the stones there, as they shulde fynde them most ready, without sparing edifices publique or particuler. And after that he had shewed them this, and what he intended to do, he went to Lacedemonye. At whyche place beynge aryued, he went not to the officers, nor to the counsel in many dayes. But whan any of the counsailers demanded him wherfore he slacked somuch to go thider, he founde dyuers excuses saying yt he taryed for his cōpaignyons, excusing thair retardāce by dyuers meanes, & neuerthelas saying, that he hoped that they shuld come ryght shortly, & that he maruailed, howe they taryed so long. Wh

                  rūto the honest people of the towne did geue credite, for the amitie & knowlaige that they hadde of hym. But durynge this tyme, people came euery daye, that reported to the sayd Lacedemonyās, how that the walles of Athens were cōtynually made vp with all diligēce. And nowe were so heighned, that it was not to bileue, yt they wolde cease. Themistocles, thā seinge that there was no more meanes to abuse them, prayed them, that they wolde not beleue reaportes, but to sende frome amongest thē fayth

                  ull parsones vnto the places for to see the thinge at y• eye, and to make vnto thē true reaport. which they did. And on the other side, he sente secretly by one his messenger to aduertyse the Athenyans, that they shuld reteigne the sayd Ambassadours by the most cloked meane that they coulde, & not to suffer them to departe, vntill that he were come again vnto thē. In the meane time

aryued togither his companyons of the Ambassade, to wytt, Hambronicus son of Lysicles, & Aristides sonne of Lysimachus. who signefied hym that the walles of Athens were nowe of good heigh and defensible. For he feared that whā the Lacedemonyans vnderstode the trouthe of the thinge, that they wolde restrayne them. The Athenyans did righte well that, whyche he commaunded them. whereof, after that he was aduertysed, he came to the counsayle of Lacedemonyans, and shewed them that the walles of his cytie were nowe made i

                   suche sorte, that they were defensible for them that were within yt. And if the sayde Lacedemonyans or thair sayde allyes woolde frōthence forwardes sende thair Ambassadours, they sholde sende them vnto people, that vnderstode well what were e

And also sithens, in all the affayres that happened duringe the warre, whan they were putt into deliberation, thaire opynion was founde so good, as any of the other. And therfore they thought yt good, most expedient and profytable, that thair cytie were enclosed with walles, rather than to leue it open, aswell for the wealth of them, as of thair allyes, for yt were impossible that thinges might egally be consulted vpon, where as indifferēcie were not hadde. wherfore it was nedefulle, aither that all the cyties confederated shulde be wtout walles, orells that those Lacedemonyēs confesse & acknowlaige that those of Athēs haue bene made with good raison. The Lacedemonyens shewed not thēselfe to be displeased against the Atheniās, for thies wordes. For also they sent not thair Ambassade to impesch thē precisely to make thair walles, but only to perswade them to put the matter into general deliberatiō. For y•, that they had thē in great loue, for the good wyll that they had shewed, & for saruyce that they had done at ye warre of ye Medes. Neuerthelas also they were sory to haue bene so deceyued of thair opyniō. In this māner retourned Thābassadours of both partes wtout any declaratiō of displeasure. And also ye cytie of Athenes, was by this meanes in shorte tyme, enclosed wt walles. which were made with greate haste, as may be well perceiued by this, y• men may se the foūdacions to be of many sortes of stones. & in some places they be not

                  arued for monumentes or tombes. and had made the circuicte of the walle muche more large than the towne was. And for this cause they toke the stuf in all places to fournyshe yt. Besides this, Themistocles perswaded the Athenyans to make an ende of the walle, whiche he had caused to be begonne in the yeare, wh

                  selfe to saylinge, whyche was the thyng, by meanes wherof, he thought that the cytie might be made more puyssante. For this cause he was the furste, that had the hardynes to say to the Athenyās, that there lacked to rule the sea. And incō
                  tynently afterwarde beganne to enterprise the Empyre. Thus by hys counsaile
                     •
                   the wall was made and fynyshed, wherwith the porte of Pyree was enclosed (so that we se it now if such largenes, that two wagons may passe there) al of great quartered fre stones wtin fourth made with chalke & sande, and on the owte side the stones be ioyned with graspes of irone with leade. But yet it is not raysed aboue y• one halfe in height, that it was appoynted to be of. which was such, yt if it

had bene so made, A very fewe people, though they were no warryous, might haue kepte it agaynste a greate armye. And the other people of defence, myghte haue entred theyr shyppes for to fyght. For all hys entente was principally, to the affayres of the sea. For thys cause (as I thinke) that he perceyued that the Medes, yf they wolde retourne into Grece, might come sooner, & more easely by sea, than by lāde. Wherfore it was more expedyēt, to fortefye the porte of Pyree, than the cytie. For this cause, he oftentymes perswaded the Atheniās, yt yf they were constrayned or ouercharged by lande, they might retyre & strength them in thys place, and make all their defence by sea. In suche manner, the Athenyans after the departure of the Medes, fortefyed theyr cytye and theyr porte wyth walles. Anone afterwardes, Pausanyas Lacedemonyan,Pausanias. sonne of Cleombrotus Duke of Grekes, departed from Peloponese with twenty greate shyppes. And with hym went thirty other shyppes wyth Athenians, togeders with a greate n
                     •
                  mber of other theyr allyes, whiche wente all to lande in Cypres. where they toke by force, many townes and cytyes. And frō thence went to Bizance,Byzantium. which the Medes dyd yet than hold, and dyd take it lykewyse by force. All which thinges were done vnder the conduct of the sayde Pausanias. But for that he shewed hym selfe to lofty, or high, and imperiall towardes the allyes, and impytuous to all other, and specyally to the Ionyans and those that newely had bene recouered from the obeysance of the Medes, they could not indure it. but prayed the Athenyans for the amyte and allyāce that was betwene them, that they woulde be theyr heades, and not suffre, that the sayde Pausanias shulde so oppresse and ouertreade them. Wherunto the Athenyans gaue willyngly the eare, and watchedde the meane and occasyon, howe they might most honestlye do it. So chaunced it, that in the meane tyme, Pausanias was sent for or commaunded home, by the Lacedemonyans, who had nowe ben aduertysed by many people of the vyolences, that he dyd, and that he gouerned hymselfe more lyke a tyraunte, than a Duke. And by thys meane, all at one tyme, he was called backe, & all the Grekes became vnder the obeysance of the Athenyans, reserued them of Peloponese. And after that the same Pausanias was come agayne to Lacedemonye: he was conuicted of many violences & particuler pyllages, b
                     •
                  t no greate cryme coulde be approued agaynste hym. Neuertheles before he was acquyted, it was layde to hys charge, that he had confederacie wyth the Medes. And for so muche as it was in a manner clerely approued so to be, they wolde not sende hym agayne to the armye, to haue the charge, but in hys stede they sent Docres,Dorcis. and certayne other Capitaines with a small nomber of people. But whan they were aryued at the armye, the sayde men of warre, seing, that Docres regarded them not, retourned vnto theyr houses. Whiche seynge, the Lacedemonians wolde not sende other vnto them, fearyng that those, that they shulde sende thē, shulde become worse, lyke as they had experimented by Pausanias. And moreouer they desyred gladly to be delyuered from the warre of the Medes. And to leue the charge therof, to the Athenyans, who semed to them to be people mete to haue conduyte therof, and also were than, theyr good frendes. The Athenyās hauynge by thys meane taken the auctorytye and principalitie vpon the Grekes, imposed and rated for euery of the cities confederated, a certayne nomber of shyppes, and a certayne quantytie of monney for defence of the countrey against the Medes. And also to reuenge them of the euyls, that they had done in the countreye of Grece. Wherunto, the sayde confederates dyd gentely agree for the great hatred that they hadde conceyued agaynste Pausanias. And than treasourers and receiuours were furst created by the Athenians, for to recouer, and kepe

the monney of that same imposte, whiche they called, Tribute. And it was the furste, that euer had bene imposed ouer the Grekes, and yt amounted to the some of foure houndred threskoore talentes, and the temple of Delos was chosen for to kepe it in.Delos. And there the sayde confederates dyd make theyr assemblies, and so euery of the confedered cytyes, at the begynnynge, did chose theyr Dukes and heades, whiche dyd gouerne them accordyng to theyr lawes. And they were all called, and had theyr voyce in the common consultacyons that were made for the feates of warre. The Athenians came to thys degre of rule and auctorytye, by occasyon of warre with the Medes. And for the de

But sythens the sayde warre vntyll this presente, whereof we speake, the sayde Athenyans dyd many greate feates. aswell agaynst straūgers, as agaynst theyr cōfederates, that wolde haue made nouuelties, and also agaīst certayne Peloponesiās, which in all the affayres of the sayd Athenyās, were willyng to withstande and hynder them.

that through stouthfulnes to go to warre, and that they wolde not forsake their houses, some amonge them had compounded to geue moneye in steade of shippes, whiche they were bounde to fournyshe for theyr portion. By meane wherof the power of the Athenyans waxed strong by sea, and they abodde holy destitute of shyppes. In suche sorte, that whan afterwardes they woulde haue rebelled, they founde themselues vnprouyded, and coulde not resiste. After these thynges the Athenyans and theyr confederates made warre agaynste the Medes. And in one daye, hadde two victoryes, the one by lande nyghe the ryuer of Eurymedone in the countreye of Pamphilie,Eurimedon. and the other vpon the sea, nyghe therunto, vnder the conducte of Symon.

But the Athenyans sente thyder theyr armye by sea, whiche descomfyted that same of the Thasians. And afterwardes landed and assieged the cytye. In thys selfe tyme, they sente tenne thousande housholdes, aswell of their citezeins, as of theyr allyes, to the quarter of Strymonne for to inhabyte wyth theyr people the towne, whiche was than called, neuf chemins, and is nowe named Emphipolis,Amphipolis. and chased from thence the Edonians,Edoni. that held it. But afterwardes, those Athenians beyng entred further by lande into the countreye of Thrace, were all descomfyted, nyghe vnto Darasinque,Drabescus. by the people of the countrey, who were despleased, that the sayde towne was so peopled with straungers.

                  , the Lacedemonyans beganne warre agaynste them of Ithome. and thereby, coulde not succour them of Thase. Who, by these meanes, were constrained by the lengthe of the assiege, at the ende of thre yeares, to render them to the wylle of the Athenyans. whiche dyd rase downe theyr walles, and toke from thē all theyr shyppes. And further, caused them to pay all that, that they could make at that tyme, and taxed great stipendes to be payde in tyme to comme. But by thys meane, they lefte them theyr territorye and the mynes of metalls, that were in the mountaygnes. Duryng thys tyme, the Lacedemonyans perceyuing that the warre, which they had begonne agaynst them of Ithome, dyd draw to be very longe, they sente to all theyr allyes, to haue succour and ayde of thē. And amonge the other, towardes the Athenyans, for that they semed vnto them, most expert to assaulte townes & walles, and that by theyr ayde they myghte take the towne by lengthe of siege. whiche they myght haue done (for the Athenyans sente vnto them Cymon, with a greate bende) yf the Lacedemonyans had not suspected the sayd Athenyans. wherby afterwardes, open discorde folowed

Wherupon the Athenyans knowyng euydently that thys was done for suspytyon, and not for other cause, toke this lycence to great dyspleasure. For they thought well, that they had not meryted that same, towardes the Lacedemonyens. And therfore beyng comme agayne to Athenes, and hauyng made reaporte to the cytesens, they departed from the amytie and allyance, that they had made with the Lacedemonyans at the warre of the Medes, and dyd reallye themselues with the Argyues,Argiui. who were ennemyes of the Lacedemonyans, and both two togidres made allyance with the Thessalyans.Thessal

                     . But in the meane tyme, they that were within Ithome, seynge them to weake to resiste the might of the enemys, beyng also anoyde by the length of the siege, which they had nowe susteigned nighe vpō tenne yeares, they made appoinctement with the Lacedemonyans. By whiche it was ordeyned, that they shulde auoyde the towne and all the countreye of Peloponese in suertye, wythout euer to retourne thyder. And yf any of them were found there, that he shuld be bondman vnto hym that toke hym. which appoinctment those same Lacedemonyans made, through occasyon of an aunswere, that they had had before, durynge the warre, by the Oracle of Apollo pythius. Which was of suche substaunce. The Ithomyan, that shall requyre mercye, ought to be suffred to passe. And the Ithomyans being by thys meane chased from theyr landes, withdrewe themself, all, with theyr wyues and householdes, towardes the Athenyans. Who, for the hate, that they had agaynste the Lacedemonians, receyued them willyngly, and sente them to inhabit the Islande of Naupacte,Naupactum. which they had newely conquered. And they hadde chased from thence the Locres Osolyans. And in a manner, at the self same tyme, they of Megare departed frome the allyance of the Lacedemonyans, and rendred them selues vnto the Athenyans. By occasion of thys, that hauyng warre agaynste the Corinthians for theyr lymytes or boundes, the sayde Lacedemonyans sent them no succoure. And by this meane, the Athenyans do holde Megare, & the towne of fountaynes, which they name Pegase. which place of Megare, they fortefyed with thicke walles, ye extended from the cytye, vntyll the ryuer of Nysee.Nisoea. And the same Athenyans caused those walles to be warded by theyr people. whiche was the furste cause of the enmytye betwene the Athenyans and the Corinthians. It chaunsed vpon thys, that Inarus sonne of Sannyticus kynge of Lybyans, that be borderers to the countreye of Egypte, hauynge assembled a mightye puyssance in hys citie named Marye sur le Phare,Maria super Pharū. entred into the sayde countreye of Egypte, which was than in the subiection of King Artharerses. and so what by force, and what by treatie, wythdrewe a greate parte to hys obeysance. and that done, sent towardes the Athenyans for to make allyaunce with them. Who at that tyme were aryued at the Islande of Cipres, with two houndred shyppes, aswell of theyr owne, as also of theyr allyes. And after that they had harde and vnderstanded the requeste of the sayd Inarus, they lefte the enterpryse of Cypres, and wente from those parties, and by the sea, entryng into Nylus, they toke at theyr aryual two partes of the cytye of Memphis.Memphis. And the thyrde, named, the whyte walle, they besieged. Wherunto were retyred the Medes & the Perses, that were escaped

from the other two partes with the Egyptians, that were not rebelles. On the other syde, in the self same tyme, the Athenyans that wente fourthe wyth theyr shyppes, nyghe vnto Habie, dyd fight agaynste the Corinthians,Halia. & against the Epydauryans, and were vainquyshed. But anone after in a battayle by sea, which they had agaynst the Peloponesyans nere vnto Cecriphale,Cecryphalea. they had the victorye. And agayne after, hauyng begonne warre agaynst the Egenytes,Aeginete. they had there an other great battayle betwene them by sea, nygh vnto Egyne,Aegina. in the which, all the allyes and confederates of bothe partyes dyd mete, wherof lykewyse those Athenyans had the victorye, and dyd wynne or drowne .lxx. shyppes of ennemys. And pursuyng theyr victorye, entred into lande, and besieged the sayde citie of Egyne. Hauing Locrates,Locrates. the sonne of Stribus, for Capitaine. whiche seynge, the Peloponesyans dyd take the quarell of the saide Egynettes, as theyr allyes, and sente to theyr succoure for the begynnynge, thre houndred mē, Corinthians and Epidaurians, who occupied the promontoryes of Geranee.Geranea. And on the other syde, the Corinthians with theyr allyes, entred in battayle into the lande of Megare, thinkyng that the Athenians, hauing an armye in Egypte and at Egyne, could not defende, in so many places: and at the least, yf they wold defende the countreye of Megare, they shulde be cōstrayned to rayse theyr siege from before Egyne. whiche notwithstandynge, they dyd not. But all they, that coulde beare harnnoies, aswell olde as yonge, came out of the cytye, and met the Corynthyans before Megare. And so dyd fyght agaynst them. And the battaile was so egall, that aither of the partyes, pretended to haue had the victorye therof. But the Athenians dyd make and set vp theyr Trophe or signe of victorye, pretending to haue had the better, for that, that they abodde and kepte the cāp. By meane wherof the Corinthians, that were retourned into theyr cytye, seynge that the auncyent cytezeins blaymed them, for that they were retyred, came agayne twelue dayes after, for to plante and set vp theyr Trophee, foranempste the same of the enemyes. But the Athenyans that were in Megare, yssued forth vpon them with so greate furye, that they slewe all them, that hadde sett vp the sayde Trophee. and the other yt shulde haue bene theyr faulsgarde, they put to flyght. Of whome a great parte in theyr sleyinge, ranne into a felde closed wyth dyches, so that there was none commynge fourthe. which seyng, the Athenyans dyd set at the entring a good bende of theyr men to kepe them, that they retourned not backe, And the other ennyroned the sayde dyche on all sydes, and with strokes of stones slewe all them that were entred within. which was a great plage to them of Corinthe, though the reste of their people dyd saue themself within the towne. Aboute the tyme that these thynges were done, the Athenyans enterprysed and beganne to make two great and thicke walles, that wente from the cytye. Thone, vntyl the port of Pyreus, and the other vntyl the same of Phalere.Phalern. At which tyme, the Phociens hadde their armye agaynst the Doryans,Dores. frō whome the Lacedemonyans were nowe departed, & helde besieged thre of theyr townes, to wytt, Beon, Sytynyō & Erineon. Wherof after yt they had taken the one, the Lacedemoniās sent to the succour of the said Doryās, Nicomedes sonne of Celobrotus,Nicomedes. who than gouerned the citie, for & in stede of Plistynates sōne of Pausanias,Plistoanax. kinge of Lacedemoniās, wt a thousand, fyue houndredmen of their lande, & about ten thousand of their allies & cōfederates. Notwithstāding before they aryued, Understanding yt the Doryans had rendred thēself, by composition vnto the Corinthiās, they retourned vnto their houses. But they were in greate feare to be empesched by ye Atheniās yf they toke their voiage by sea. for on ye cost of the goulphe of Crissee,Crissoeus. the Atheniās had great nōber of shyppes armed, & on the other coast of Geraine, there was also dāger. for yt the Athenyans dyd holde

Megare and fountaynes, called Pegase, and had there alwayes both people and shyppes. And further the passage was harde and strayght. and also they knewe that the Athenyans dyd there wayte for them. For this cause they concluded for the moste expedyente, to soiourne in the countreye of the Beotians, vntyll suche tyme, that they had better aduysed for theyr iourneye. And also at the persuasion of some of the Athenyans, suche as imagyned to chaunge the gouernaunce populair of the cytye of Athenes, and to lett that the walles shulde not be parfaicted, that were begonne. But the Athenians that perceyued it, came fourth agaynst the Lacedemonyans, both olde and yonge to the nomber of a thousand, and assembled of theyr allyes, to the nomber of .xiiii. thousande, aswel for that, that it semed to them, that theyr ennemys knewe not whyder to go, as also for that, that they greatly doubted that they were cōme for to trouble theyr estate and common gouernaunce. Besyde the sayd nomber, certaine horsmen of the Thessalians, came to ayde the sayde Athenians, for the allyance that they hadde with them. But they tourned to the other parte, at the battayle, that was made nyghe the towne of Tanagre,Tanagra. in the countreye of Boece, wherof the Lacedemonyans hadde the victorye, notwithstandyng that there was greate manslaughter on bothe sydes. After which victorye, the Lacedemonians entered into the countreye of Megare, and cut downe all theyr trees, afterwardes toke theyr iourney by Gerayne and by the distraict of Peloponese, and retourned into theyr houses. But the Athenyans threskoore dayes after the sayd battayle loste, retourned with a myghty power into the countreye of the Beotiens, vnder the conduct of Myronides,Myronides. and hadde a victorye ouer them, nyghe Enophite, and by meane therof, saysed themself of all the lande of Beoce, and of Phocide, and rased downe the walles of Tanagre, and toke a houndredd hostages or pledges of the rychest of the Locriens and the Eponicens. And also they fynyshed in the selfe tyme the two walles, that they had begonne at Athenes, for to extende vnto the two portes. After thys, the Egenytes were constrayned by lengthe of siege, to render them selfe to the Athenians, vpon these conditions, that they shuld beate doune theyr walles, geue ouer all theyr shyppes, and yearely pay certayne trybute. At departure from thence, the Athenyans wente rounde about Peloponese, and burned the fenses of the Lacedemonyans. and toke from the Corinthians, the towne of Calcibe. After thys, at theyr landynge, they fought agaynste the Cycionyens which were comme thyder agaynst them, and vainquished thē, all which thynges were done in Grece by the Athenyans, in the tyme, that they had theyr armye in Egypte.

Durynge whiche tyme, he

And moreouer the people of that regyon were all good warryours. But Inarus kynge of Lybyens,Inarus that had bene cause of all the rebellyon, was taken by traysone and afterwardes hanged on the gallowes. Duryng thys tyme, fyfty galleys, whiche the Athenyans sente to succoure theyr people in Egypte, arryued at one of the armes or entrynge of Nylus, named Mendesius,Mendesius. not knowynge the dyscomfyture of theyr sayde people, whiche were assauted, on the lande syde, by the people on foote that were there, and on the sea syde, by the galleys of Phenycians. In suche manner, that the greater parte were drowned, and the other saued themselfe with force of oores. Suche ende and yssue toke the great armye and enterpryse of the Athenyans and of theyr allyes in the countreye of Egypte.

By occasyon wherof, seyng that they coulde take no stronge towne, nor execute theyr enterpryse, they retourned without doyng any other thynge, but that they caryed Orestes wyth them. Anone after, a thousande Athenyans that were in the place of fountaynes, named Pegase, whiche they helde, entered into theyr shyppes that they had there, and came to arryue in Cycione vnder the conducte of Porydes,

This done, they toke the Archers into theyr compaignye, and passed through Acarnie, for to comme to take the the cytye of Emade, and so assieged it. But seynge that they coulde not take it, they retourned. And thre yeares after, they made truse for fyue yeares with the Peloponesians. Duryng the whiche, albeit that they kepte abstynence of warre in Grece, yet they made an armye of two houndred shippes, aswell of theyrs, as of theyr compaygnyons, wherof Cymon was chyef capytayne, and they wente to aryue at Cypres, being at which place. they were called backe by Amyrteus, king of the maryces and forestes of Egypte, and so they sente to the sayde countreye of Egypte, thre skore of theyr shyppes.Citium The reste remayned at the siege before the cytye of Cyrcye. But beyng Cymon theyr capytayne there deade, and they in greate necessitie of victuayles, they departed from the sayd siege to haue retourned, and sayllynge foranempste the cytye of Salamyne, whiche is in Cypres, they foughte aswell by sea, as by lande, agaynste the Phenycyans, and agaynste the Ciliciens, and had in bothe battaylles, vyctorye,

After thys, the Lacedemonyans, beganne the warre that was called, consecrated. and hauing taken the temple, that is at Delphos, dyd delyuer it agayne to the people of the towne. But it taryed not longe, that the Athenyans came thyder wyth a mightye armye. whiche toke it agayne and delyuered it, to kepe, vnto the Phocians. Anone after, the bānyshed men, that the Athenyans had chased from the countrey of Beoce, hauyng occupyed Orcomenye,Orchomenū. Cheronee,Cheronoea. and some other townes of the sayde countreye, the Athenians sente thyder a thousande men of theyrs, with an other nomber of theyr allyes, as they myghte redelye get them, vnder the conducte of Tholmydas,Tolmida. sonne of Tholmee. And so toke agayne Cheronee, and furnished it wyth theyr people. And retournynge from thence, they were encontred by the sayde bānyshed men, Beotiens, who had assembled the bānyshed of Eubee, the Locres, and some other takyng theyr partye. who descomfyted them. The more parte of them beyng slayne. and the other taken prysoners. By whose meane, & by deliuering of them, the Athenyans made appointment with the sayde Beotiens, & restored them to theyr lybertie. And by occasyon therof, all the bannyshed and other that were gone from the sayd countrey, retourned thyder incontinētly, vnderstandynge to be set agayne into theyr former lybertye. It taryed not longe after, that the Islande of Eubee, rebelled agaynste the Athenyans, and so as Perycles,Pericles. whome the sayd Athenyans had sente with a greate armye for to brynge them into theyr obeysance, was in hys iourneye for to go thyder, he receyued newes, that they of Megare were lykewyse rebelled, and had slayne the garnysone of Athenyans, that were wythin, excepte a small nomber which saued them self at Nisee.

In suche manner, that they had the vpper hande. Afterwardes they wente strayghte waye to Lemne, and from thence recouered theyr hostages, and fourthwith rebelled agaynste the Athenyans, and toke the people, that the Athenyans had lefte there, aswell for the gouernaunce of the towne, as also for the kepe it. whome they gaue vnto Pissuthnes.

               IT nedeth not more, Lordes Peloponesiās, to blame nor charge the Lacedemonyans, that they wyll not enterpryse warre agaynste the Athenyans, consyderynge that they haue assembled vs here, for thys cause. Also it is reasonable, that they, ye gouerne (as they be preferred to honnours before all the other) that they haue such regarde to thaffayres of particulers in generall, that all may be egally gouerned and enterteigned. But as touchyng vs and other, which lately be departed from the Athenyans, it is no more nedefull, to admonish vs, to beware of them. But onely they must be admonyshed, that dwell in the meane lande farre from the sea portes, where be the feares & staples of marchandyses. For it is very nedefull that they vnderstande, that yf they geue not ayde and succour to them which dwell in the base countreys nighe the sea, the fatchyng of theyr goodes and of theyr marchā
                  dyse shalbe much more difficile, & also the bryngyng agayne of wares, which come vnto thē by sea. Wherfor they ought not now to make ille iudgemēt of this, wherof is questyon, saying that it nothing toucheth them, but they ought to vnderstande, that yf they take no regarde of the inhabitantes of the base countreye, and do su
                     •
                  fre them to be lost, the daunger shal afterwardes come vpon thē. And herefor is it, that thys present consultacyon is made, aswell for them, as for the other. For thys cause, they oughte not to be nyece and negligent to enterpryse this warre, for to haue afterwardes peace. For as it is conuenyent, for graue & prudent people, to lyue in peace and reste, whan they be not wronged, and that no violence is done vnto them: Euen so it is conuenient, for vertuous and couragyous people, to tourne peace into warre, whan they be oultraged. And after that they haue wel prouyded for theyr affayres, to come agayn to peace & accorde. And nother to be proud for the prosperitie of the victorye, nor also, for couetyse of peace and of reste, to suffre thēself to be oultraged. For he, that for to muche loue of reste, is nyce, & not forcinge to reuenge him self, parceyueth hym selfe very sone depryued of the voluptuousnes, that he taketh of the reste. Also that parsone, that hath oftentymes good aduentures in warre, forgetteth hym selfe by vnassured and vnfaythfull fiercenes and crueltie, in suche sorte that he thinketh not what he ought to do. For oftentymes, foolyshe enterpryses chaunce well, for that, that the ennemyes dyd conducte theyrs, more folyshly. And also manye enterpryses, that semed, to haue ben well begonne, haue myshappened. For that, that the thynges in suche matter be neuer executed in the sorte, that they were purposed vpon. Also men haue alwayes good and certayne hope of thynges to comme, that they do enterpryse. But whan it cometh to execute them, they fayle oftentymes, for feare. Nowe as touchyng vs, who haue bene greatly oultraged by the Athenyans, we purchase and enterpryse warre against them vpon good and iuste quarell, to the intent to lyue alwayes in peace and reste, after, that we shall haue ben reuenged of them. Of the which warre, we oughte to hope to haue the victory for many reasons. The furste for that, yt we haue greater nomber of people, and better warryours, than they haue. And the other for that we be all, wyth one wyll, delyberated to do that, which

shalbe commaunded vs. And for that, that they arne more mighty with shippes than we, we woll supplye to that, aswell so much of our particuler monney, that we woll furnyshe euery one for hys rate a portion, as also of the Syluer, which is in the tēple of Delphos, & in ye same of Olimpus, which we may coigne. And by that meanes, we shall easely wtdrawe & reteigne their maronniers & also theyr men of warre, which be more straungers and mercenaries or huyred souldyours, than borne in that countrey. which thing is otherwyse with vs. For we be more mighty of people, than of monneye. And
yt we maye haue the victorye ouer them, it is to beleue, that they shalbe discomfyted. And also, howe much the more longer that they resiste, so muche the more our people shall exercyse & applye thēself to the sea. And so muche, as they be people of more harte, thā theirs, whan that they shall haue ben exercysed, they shalbe alwayes more strong. For ye hardynes that ours haue, cometh vnto thē of nature. which the other may not acquyre or get, nother by arte nor by learnynge. But we maye well by exercyse acquyre the industrie or trauayle, yt they haue, more than we, and also we shall fynde moneye ynough for to fournyshe thys affayre. For yf theyr allyes refuse not to paye them trybute for to be in theyr seruytude and subiectyon, we shall not be so wretched, that we refuse to contrybute with theirs, goodes for to reuē
                  ge vs of oure ennemyes, and to saue oure lybertye. For also, whan they shall haue taken them from vs, they woll intreate vs worse by cause of our goodes. We haue on the other parte many other meanes to make warre agaynste them. The furst is, that we woll practyse theyr allyes and subiectes, and woll cause them to rebelle agaynste them, and by thys meane we woll cause them to lose the reuenues, that they haue more than we. Also we maye destroy theyr countreys and territoryes, whereby monney groweth vnto them, and many other occasyons & meanes maye happen to vs, wherof we nowe take no aduyse. For there was neuer warre made holy by the meanes, and accordyng to the preparatiō that was deuysed from the begynnynge, but of it self, it causeth others to comme to the vnderstandyng of men, accordynge to the accydentes and chaunces, whiche do occurre and happen. And in that, they, that haue most hygh and entier courage, be in greater suertie, than they which be in sadnes and in feare. And euery one of vs ought to thincke and imagyne, that yf he had questyon of hys lymites or boundes wyth hys neyghbours, that were as myghtye as he, that he woulde not suffre hym selfe to be oultraged. Now presently, the Athenyans be myghtye ynough to subdue vs altogider, whereby they shall more easely subdue vs particularly, towne 
                     •
                  or towne. whiche thynge they woll do, yf that we allye not our selues together, and resiste them, all wyth one accorde. And yf they haue the
victorye ouer vs (though it be a thynge ryght heauy and dyspleasante to be spoken) yet alwayes he that heareth it, ought to vnderstande, that that same victorye, shalbe no other thynge but oure bondage, whiche is a thynge abhomynable to be harde named, in Peloponese, muche more to see by effecte, so manye noble cytyes to be suppedytated and trauaylled by one, onely cytye. wherin it semeth, eyther that we be nyce and neglygent, or for feare to muche pacyent, and by that meane degenerating frome the vertue and glorye of our ancestres, who haue delyuered all Grece from seruytude. And it semeth, that we be not suffycyente to defende oure lybertye, whan we suffre one onely cytye to vsurpe the gouernemente ouer vs, where as whan there is one onely tyraunt in a cytye we demaunde that he maye be chased awaye. And we do not consyder that by indurynge thys, we incurre into thre greate and euyll vyces, to wytt, cowardnes pusillanymytie and imprudence. And yt auaileth nothyng to say for to excuse

youe of the sayd vyces, that youe woll exchue the temeritie and rashnes. whyche hath bene pernycious vnto many people. For this excuse (vnder shadowe wherof many haue bene deceyued) ought rather for feare, to be named, madnes. But it sarueth nothinge to oure purpose to taxe or reprehende thinges passed, by longer talke, than the tyme requyreth, but we ought in prouyding and succouring thinges presente, to trauaile for those, that be to cōme. For you holde, and haue lerned of your ancestres, to acqiure vertues by laboures and trauayles. Frome whome ye shulde not degenerate nor swarue. And if that youe were auncyently more ryche & more mightie than t

Youe haue moreouer many reasons and occasyons, whyche shulde moue and encourage youe to make warre. The furste is the aunswere of the god Apollo, who hath promysed to ayde youe, youe shall haue more to youre helpe, all the reste of Grece, partly for feare, partly for thair proffitt. And youe oughte not to feare furste to breake the peace and the allyance, whyche we haue with the Athenyans, whyche the God, who perswadethe vs to beginne warre, Iudgeth to haue bene furste infringed by them. But yt shalbe rather to defende the traicties and confederations which, they haue violated and brokēne. For they that defende themselues be not infractours of the peace, but they that furst make assaulte Wherfore by al reasonne, there can not, but goodnes, happen vnto vs to enterpryse this warre. And in asmuche as youe knowe, by the thynges that we haue shewed youe here in generall assemblie, for to anymate and perswade, howe it is necessary, aswell for the comon welth of all, as for the particuler of euery one amongeste vs: Delaye no more to defende youre lybertie, and particularly to geue ayde to them of Potyde, whiche be Doriens, and be assieged by the Ionyans. whyche is hole contrary to that, that was wont to be in tymes paste. For that, that if we presently dissemble, we shall suffre one of vs to be destroyed. And whā it shalbe published yt we haue made this assemblie for to reuenge vs, but that we dare not, we may vnderstande, that there may be asmuche done to the other. But lordes, allyes, and confederates, knowinge that we be comme into this necessytie, and that we coūsaile you that, which is for the beste, youe ought to determyne and enterprise this warre. And you ought not somuch to be afrayd of soubdaine incomodites & difficulties of the warre, as to thinke of the goodnes, whyche shall come vnto youe, by the longe peace that thereby shall folowe. For peace establisheth itselfe by warre. And also men be not assured to be withoute daunger whan they be in reste and wythoute warre. And on the othere parte in subduinge by force that cytie of Grece, whiche woll vsurpe the tyrannye or rule ouer all the othere, (wherof it alredy ruleth some, and purposeth to rule the reste) we shall certainely abyde afterwardes in suertie, and shall sett at lybertie those, that be in seruitude and bondage. Thus dyd the Corynthians speake.
            
            
               
               How the warre being concluded agaynst the Athenyans, by all the Peloponesians in the cytie of Sparte, the Lacedemonyans, sente thair Ambassadours towardes the Athenyans for to sommone them of certayne causes. The .xiiii. Chapter.
               WHan the Lacedemonyans had harde all thē of the other cyties speake, whiche were there assembled, they caused to be geuen small balles to the Ambassadours of euery of them, for to declare by that meanes, whider they willed peace, or warre. So they were all of opynyon to make warre, whyche was by them concluded and determined. But there was no meane at that tyme to begynne yt, for they were vnprouyded of all thinges. For thys cause, it was deuysed that euery one of the sayde cyties shulde contrybute. And ordayned that it shulde be done withoute tracte or lengthe of tyme, whiche they did in lesse than one yeare. And in the meane tyme they sente Ambassadours towardes the Athenyans, for to expounde and declare thaire faultes and crymes, wherof they were charged. To thintente to haue better & more iuste occasion to make them warre, if they amended them not immediatly. And chiefly demāded thē, that they shuld purge the mysdede & offence, wherwith the Goddes were offended, whyche was suche. There hadde bene sometyme a citezeine of the cytie of Athenes, named Cylon, a noble and a mighty man, who had gottone, the pryze at Olympe. This Cilon hadde to wyfe the doughter of Theagenes, who than was ruler of Megare. In makinge whyche mariage, aunswere was geuen to the saide Cylone,Cylon by the god Apollo of Delphos, that whan the greate feaste of Iupiter shulde be, he shulde enioye the fortresse of Athenes. who hauinge the conducte of men of warre of Theagenes, hys

Perswading him, that, that was the greatest feaste of Iupiter, that was made. And for that, that he had at other tymes wonne the pryse in the sayd feast, yt semed to hym the more that, ye same sarued to his case and prophecie, of the god. For he had not cōsidered, if the aunswere extended to the feast that was celebrated at Athens or at other places. Also the god had not declaired yt. And yet the Athenyans celebrated a very solempne feast euery yeare in the honor of Iupiter without the cytie, in the which were sacrificed many beastes, counterfaicted by so greate arte, that they semed to be lyuinge. But Cylon, who had interpretated the oracle of Apollo to hys owne fantasie, thinking to do well, enterprisedde the matter, like as hath bene shewed. whan the Athenyans vnderstode that thair fortresse was takenne, all they that were in the feldes assembled and came to assiege the sayde Cylone and his men wythin the saide fortresse. But for that the place was stronge, and that it noyed them to be there all occupyed, the more parte wente to chaire affaires, and lefte the charge to nyne of theym with a competente nomber of people to kepe and h

beynge constrayned by famyne, after that manye were deade, came to couche themselues, bifore the great awter, whiche was within the sayde fortresse. Thā they that had the charge of the siege beinge entred within, wolde haue caused theyme to aryse. And seyinge that they dyed, to thintente that the temple shuld not be polluted and defyled, did drawe them fourth, and afterwardes did kylle them. But there were some that were mourdred in passing by the infarnal goddes, and some, at the fote euenne of the aulters. By occasion whereof, they that committed the dede, and all thair discente, were holdenne for cruelle and sacrileges. And also the malefactours, were bannyshed by the Athenyans. And likewise by Cleomenes chased out of Lacedemonye. And afterwardes, beinge come into newe dissention wyth the Athenyans, they that were founde of the sayd lingnaiges, were not onely dryuenne oute of the cytie, but also the bones of the buryed were caste forth from thence. And yet by successyon of tyme, they came thider agayne, and euen at this presente there be certayne housholdes there dwellinge. And that they did, knowynge that Pericles sonne of Xantippus was descended of the same rase or strayne by hys mother, hopinge that if we were chased out of the cytie, they might afterwardes more easely come to the ende of thaire warre agaynst the Athenyans. And if that he were not chased fromthence, at the leaste he shuld cōceyue an great hate towardes the people that had this opynyon, that for beinge mynded to saue them, that same warre was in parte commenced and bigonne against them. Now he was in that same tyme, the Chiefest man of the cytie, and had most authoritie. And also contraryed the enterpryses of the Lacedemonyens. And anymated the Athenyans to defende them by force of armes. To this requeste, the Athenyans than answered the Lacedemoniens with the selfe same arte. Sayinge that those Lacedemonyans oughte likewise to purge the sacrilege, wherewith they were infected, by meane of the violence, that they had done in the temple of Neptunus, in the place of Tenare. For at a certayne tyme bifore passed, at the instigation of Tynarus,Toenarus. they had drawin out of the tē
                  ple of Neptunus and slayne certayn fugitiues, that requyred mercy, and by this meane, violated the franchise and lybertie of the temple. By occasion wherof, the people had opynyon, that therupon followed a great earth quake. whyche anone after chaunced in the cytie of Sparte. And furthermore the same Athenyans requyred the Lacedemonyans to purge an othere sacrylege, wherwith they were lykewyse infected by cause of the tēple of Pallas, whyche happened in this manner as folowethe.

But the truith was, for to appoyncte with the kynge of Medes touchinge that same warre, whyche he hymselfe had bigonne. And afterwardes by meane of the sayd

For to come to whiche conclusions, he had nowe, duringe his charge bifore his accusation, wonne the fauor of the kynge by a singuler plaisir and benefitte, whiche he did him.

After that Pausanias had receyued the said lettres, notwithstanding that he was in great reuerence wt all the Grekes, for the charge & authoritie that he had, he toke much more great hart & greater audacytie. In such sort, yt he was not cōtent to liue after the māner accustomed of ye Grekes, but went fourth of Bizance apparailled after ye facyō of Medes, & in going through the coūtrey of Thrace, he had souldiars, Medes & Egiptiās in his cōpaigny. And also caused himselfe to be sarued at the table plētefully after the maner of Medes. And for effect, he could not cōceyle his hart nor enterprises, but gaue to vnderstād by y•, that he did, that which in his courage he cōspired to do. He was also daūgerous to geue audyēce, & was easely angred with euery mā. In such sort, that ther was not he, that feared not to aboorde him. which was the principall cause, for which the cōfederates of Grece, departed from the Lacedemonyens, & did allye thēselfe with the Athenyās. By occasyon wherof, the Lacedemoniēs reuoked him from his charge, as it hath bene shewed. Afterwards being departed by ye sea of Harimond wtout licēce of the lordeship, it was suspected yt he wold resume the authorite. For reasō wherof, being arryued at Bizance, where the Athenyans kepte the assiege, he was chased away

by the Lacedemonyens, and after he came not againe to Sparte, but withdrew himself into certayne villages of Troade. And being there, it was signefied vnto the Lacedemonyens that he treated wt the Barbarous or strangers, some euille matter, so they thought it good no more to dissymule. And sent a sargeant with his mace from one of the Tribuns of the people, whome they calle Ephores. whoe gaue hym in commaundemente that he shulde incontynently come to Sparte as faste, as he,, and not to departe from his company, vpon payne to be reputed rebelle & ennemy of the cytie. And mynding not to make himselfe more suspected, hopinge also by monney to iustefye and purge him from crymes, that were layde vpon him, wente to Sparte with the sayde sargeaunte. But fourthwith as he was arryued, he was putt in prysone by ordenance of the sayd Ephores. Who haue auctorytie to cause to be brought thider, the kinge hymselfe. Yet he came fourth incontynently by meane of certayne, whome he had corrupted by monney, & came to present himselfe to the counsell, ready to make aunswere vnto them, that wolde charge him. Nowe neither the Citezeins nor his ennemys had no apparant wytnes or accusation for to condēpne nor punishe him. Specially beinge a man of the lignage of kynges, and also of greate dygnite and reputacion. For he had bene tutor of Plistarcus,Plistarchus. sonne of kinge Leonydes, and in hys name had, as tutor, the admynistration of his roialme. Howebeit the insolē
                  cie and fiercenes of his lyfe, and that he folowed in many thynges, the manners of strangers, made him muche suspected to haue intelligence with them, & to Imagine some thinge to rule amonge them, that were hys. And consideringe many thinges that he had done against the lawes and customes of the cyte, they made yt a great matter amongeste other, for that, that beinge in the temple of Delphos, through a maruaillous audacite & arrogancye, he wrott in a table of brasse, whyche the Grekes hadde there offredde of the spoille of the Medes, certayne verses of this substance. After that the Duke of the Grekes, had descomfited the army of Medes, Pausanias gaue this offeringe to Phebus. which verses, the Lacedemonyens caused incontynently to be taken awaye, and to be defaced. And caused to be put in place of that, that Pausanyas attrybuted only thys glory vnto hymselfe, the name of all the cytes confederated, whiche had bene at the battaile against the strangers. And furthermore, he was charged and accused of an other matter, which sarued better to the present accusation. That is, that he had as some sayde, made greate secrete treaties and coniurations with the prisonners of the cytie, promysinge to geue them lybertie, and to make them Citezeins, if they wolde ryse in armure wyth hym, and wolde do that, whyche he wolde commaunde them. whiche was a true matter. But yet it was not laufull to iudge agaynste him by accusation of prysonners, accordinge to the lawes. By whiche it was prohybited to procede to any execution diffinitiue agaynste any Cytezeine of Sparte, without vndoubtfull and certayne wytnes and accusation. So it chaunced in thies procedinges, as it is sayde, that one his domesticall seruante of the cytie of Argille, whom he had abused carnally in his yougth whyche was that same, that had charge to tary to Artabasus the laste lettres, that that same Pausanias had wryttone to the kynge Xerres, came to discouer the case vnto the Ephores. And the occasion, wherfore he did it, was for a suspitiō that he had, bicause that he had sene none of ye other messengers, that the same Pausanias had sente vnto the sayd Artabasus, retourne agayne. Wherfore fearynge that it shulde myschaunce him, he caused to coūterfeate the seale, wherwith the letters were sealed, that he might seale them agayne after that he hadde redde them, if he founde therin nothynge of that, whyche he had fantased, and to

the intent also that the sayd Artabasus shulde not parceyue that they had bene opened. Hauinge than openned and redde theym, he founde amōgest other thinges that, wherof he doubted. That is, that by the same, Pausanias did write to Artabasus, that he shulde slaye him. whiche he incontynētly brought to the said Ephores. wherby they were greatly instructed accordinge to thair imagination, that they hadde agaynste the sayd Pausanias. But yet the better to knowe the trouthe, they wolde gladly vnderstāde it by his mouthe, and so did vse this cautele. They founde meane, that the sayd seruant came to render himselfe within the temple or place of Tenarus, as one man, that hath offended his maistre. And putteth him into franchise or sanctuary. And did him to vnderstande, that he came thider to speake with him. whiche thing he did. And on the other syde two of the Ephores were hidde within a very secrett place, so that they might heare and vnderstande all that, whiche Pausanias and his seruant saide togither, with out beinge perceyued. Pausanias beinge than come to his man, and hauinge demanded him what was the cause, for whyche he had putt him into franchise, he declared to hym that he had opened the letters, and shewed him all the tenour, lamentinge hymselfe for that, that by the same, his sayd maistre had commaunded hym to be slayne, notwithstandinge that in all the treaties that he had hadde with the kinge, wherin he trusted in hym, he neuer founde in hym faulte, wherefore he thought it vnreasonable that he had ordeyned that he shulde be slayne. As the other messengers had bene, whome he had sent thider bifore, which were but commune people. Wherunto Pausanias aunswered, confessinge the whole to be true, and yet went about to appayse and kepe him, that he shulde not take it angrely, swerynge to hym by the temple, where he was, that he wolde neuer do hym harme. And prayinge hym that he wolde with all diligence goo towardes the sayd Artabasus, to the intente that ye matter were not empesched. All which thynges the sayde Ephores, hauinge well vnderstanded, and by this meane, holdinge the case to be very true and well wytnessed, did ordeyne that the said Pausanias shulde be apprehended within the cytie. But as the two Ephores came alongest the strete agaynste hym, he perceyued by the countenance of the one, and by the token, that the other, that was hys frend, made vnto him, that they came to take hym. And so he ranne awaye for to gett the temple of Pallas, bifore that they might take him. But bifore that he came to the sayd temple, withdrawing himselfe into a litle house whiche was therunto adioigninge, for to haue repoosed himself a litle, he was ouertaken by them, that folowed hym. Who descouered the toppe of the same house, and lett kepers to the gates, in suche sorte, that he coulde not comme fourth. But he was kepte there so longe, that he dyed for hunger. But bifore that he gaue vp the ghoste, they, that kepte hym, seinge that he dyed, dyd drawe hym oute of that place whyche was halowed, euen so beinge in a traunse, as he was. Who incontynently dyed bitwene thair handes. And after his deathe, the Ephores were of opynyō to caste him into a great caue, wherin were caste all the cariong
                     •
                  s of them, that were putt to deth by iustice. Yet afterwardes they changed thair opynyon, and caused hym to be buryed in a pytte there nyghe vnto it. But a certayne tyme after, by reuelation and aunswere of the god Apollo of Delphos, they were commaunded that they shulde take hym out of the sayd pytte and shulde bury hym in the place where he yelded vp the ghoste. whiche thinge they did. And yet at this present day, the sepulcre may be sene bifore the temple, lyke as appeareth by the letters that be grauen in the stone of the sepulture. And moreouer they were commaunded by the oracle of the god, that, for to purge the sacrilege that they had committed by violating of

the tēple of the goddesse, that they shuld in stede of one hys body, rēdre twayne. whyche they dydde. And in the stede of Pausanias, whome they had taken, they offred him, two images and statures of copper. By this meane nowe the Athenyans, for to aunswere to the Lacedemonyans, touchynge the sacrilege, wherewith they charged them, rendred them the contrary. Sayinge that it was requysitt also, that they shuld pourge this cryme and oultrage, whyche they had done to the goddesse Pallas, whiche, by the god Apollo, was iudged sacrilege.

               WHan the Lacedemonyans had vnderstande the aunswere of the Athenyans, they sente vnto them againe thair messengers, signyfying thē, howe that Themistocles had bene consentynge and parttaker of the selfe conspiracy, that Pausanias had done, like as they sayd to appere by his proces, whiche they kepte within the temple. Requiringe the Athenyans, that they shuld lykewise punishe the sayd Themistocles.Temistocles The whiche thing the sayd Athenyans lightly did beleue. And all with one accorde sente aswell from Sparte as fro Athenes, people, for to take the sayd Themistocles. Who in that same time beinge bannished from Athenes, kepte himselfe in the cytie of Argos, the more part of ye time, but oftymes he wēt through the coūtrey of Peloponese. Being than aduertised of that same deliberation, he departed from Peloponese, & went from thence by sea to Corcyre, knowing that the people of that same cytie loued him, for many plaisi
                     •
                  s and benefites that he had done them. But they shewed him that if they receiued him, they shuld cause the Spartaynes and the Athenyans to be thair ennemys. And so they sett him a land in the coaste of the Islande nexte vnto them. And after perteyuinge that he was stille pursued, he wtdrewe himself towards Admetus king of Melosses,Admetus. although he knewe him not, to be his frende. And not finding that same king in his cytie, for that he was than absent, he came to render himself to the quene his wife. who bad him to take their son by ye hand & to tary in thair house vntil the coming of the king, who taried not long bifore he retourned. And whā he was arriued, Themistocles came to present him
                     •
                  elf & shewed him. That albeit in the tyme yt he was duke of Athenes, & that, whā ye same king was at thair mercy, he had spokē against him in certaine thinges: yet were it not reasonable yt he shuld take vēgeance of him at that houre, yt he was cōme to rēder himself to his marcy, in somuch as ye things were not like, for he was thā in much more poore estate, thā the kinge was, whan the said Themistocles iniuried him. And yt apperteigned not to a noble couraige to take vēgeance, but against his egalls. And on thoder part whan the said Themistocles was against him, ye said king trauailed onely to do his proffit for goods, & not to saue his life, as the said Themistocles presently did. For if yt he restored him vnto thē that pursued him, he were cause of his death. After ye Themistocles had made thies declarations, being set vpō the groūd wt the same son of the said Admetus (which is a faciō to require ye most effectuously yt might be) ye same king caused him to arise & promised not to restore him to ye Lacedemoniās & Atheniās

whiche thinge he perfourmed, notwithstanding that sone after thair messengers came to hym and made many great declarations for to perswade him to restore hym. But vnderstandinge that he wolde goo to the kinge Xerxes, he caused him to be accompanied by lande vnto the cytie of Pydue.Pydua whiche is situated vpon the shore of ye other sea, appertaigning vnto Alexāder. In which place he entred into a shipp, which was willinge to go into Ionū. But by fortune of sea he came to lande for anempste the cytie of Nare, whiche the Atheniās did holde assieged. wherof the sayd Themistocles was greatly astonyed, & yet discouered not himselfe to the patrone of ye shippe, who knewe not bifore what he was, nor for what cause that he fledde, but sayde vnto him in this manner. If thou sauest me not & kepe me secret, I wol say to the Athenyans that thou hast taken monney of me for to saue me. But if thou doist saue me, I woll recompense the habūdantly or liberally. And the remedy is that thou suffre not any of them that be in the ship to go fourth, but kepe them here at ancre vntill we haue winde for to departe. whiche thinge the patrone graunted him, and laye at ancre a daye and a nyghte. Afterwardes hauinge recouered the wynde he halsed vp the saile for to goo towardes Ephasus. Beinge arryued at whiche place, Themistocles parfourmed that, whych he had promysed. And gaue him a good some of monney. For anone after, it was largely brought to hym, aswell from Athens, as also from Argos. From thens Themistocles toke his iourney by mayne lande with one marōner, beinge a Persyan. And so wrotte letters to Artarerxes,The tenoure of Themistocles. letters to kinge Artarerxes. who than newely succeded Xerres, his father, in the roiaulme of Mede and of Perse, whiche were of the tenour that folowith. I come vnto the kynge Artarerxes, I Themistocles, that haue done many dōmayges to thy house, more than any other Greke, by that I was constrayned to resyste thy father, who assayled me. But I dyd him much more saruyce afterwardes, whan yt was laufull for me to do yt. For he was beholden vnto me for his retourne, which was right daungerous. And this said he, for that, that after that Xerxes had lost the battaille by sea at Salamyne, that same Themistocles wrott vnto him that he shulde haste to retourne, fayninge that it was enterprised to breake the bridges where he shulde retourne, and that he had empesched it. After folowethe the reste of the Epistle. And nowe that the Grekes do parsecute me, as thy frende, I comme hither to do the muche saruyce. But I am determyned to soiourne here one yeare, and afterwardes to shewe the causes, for whiche I am comme. The king hauyng red his letters, maruailed at his wytt, and graunted him that, whiche he demaunded, to tary there one yeare wher he was, bifore to come vnto him. within which tyme, he lerned all that was possible, both of the language, and also of the māners of the Persiens. Afterwardes he came vnto the kinge, and had more authoryte about him, than any of the Grekes, that euer came thider, aswell for the dignite and great reputacyon that he had had bifore, as also for that, that he purposed and shewed him meanes, to subdue all Grece, and specially, for that he gaue them to vnderstande by experyence, that he was a man of knowlaige and diligente. For he coulde well shewe, the force and lyuelyues of his nature and of his wytt, and in this, he was maruaillous and excellent aboue all other. He was moreouer of his nature diligente and ready without hauinge at any time euer lerned any studys or sciences, than, nor after. And to geue prouision to all soubdayne cases, his counsaille was very ready and singulier. And of the thinges whiche he conducted, he had a great iudgement what wolde followe. And ordred them very quietly and discretely, & also he had good parceuerance in thinges, wherof he had not the administratiō. But aboue all, in ambiguous matters, wherin it was harde to iudge what were the

or the beste, he had a maruailous prouidence. And besides this, he was wythout feare aboue all men lyuinge in all thinges, whereof he did speake, aswell for the goodnes of his nature, as also for the redynes of his wit. He declared to the king what was to be done for y• enterprise of Grece, but bifore it was time to execute it, he dyed of a diseas, though it pleaseth some to say, that he kylled himself with poysonne, perceyuynge that he coulde not execute that, whiche he had promysed to the kynge. He was buryed in the cytie of Magnesie in the countrey of Asia,Magnesia. and there is yet sene his sepulcre vpon the market place. Of the whych cytie, the king had geuen hym the gouernance and the reuenue. whiche amoūted to fyue houndred talentes euery yeare. For to fournishe it wyth breade. 
                     ••
                  d for to fournishe yt with wyne, Lampsaque was geuen hym,Lamsacus. for that, that place was estemed to be most habundante with wyne of all Asia. And for his pytance, Mynute was geuen to hym.Mynutus, It ys said, that his parentes by hys commaundemente, caryed away hys bones, and buryed them in the countrey of Athenes, without knowlaige of the Athenyans, for somuch as it was 
                     〈◊〉
                   laufull by the lawes of the coūtrey, to bury the body of a man, that was iudged a traytor and rebelle. Suche yssue, had Pausanyas the Lacedemonyan. And Themistocles the Athenyā. who were both, in thair countrey, right noble.
            
            
               Howe after many goinges and commynges, the Athenyans dyd put it into deliberation whither they shulde rather accepte the warre, or obey to the requestes of the Lacedemonyans. Cap. xvii.
               AFter that the Lacedemonyans had requyred and summoned the Athenyans, and also that the Lacedemonyans were by them requyred and summoned to purge thair offences of the goddes, and the sacrileges of the one parte and on the othere, those Lacedemonyans sente againe to the Athenians to warne them that they shuld restore and set the Potydyans againe into libertie. And suffre the Egynyans, to lyue according to their lawes. But chiefly they declared, that they wold not commēce the warre against them, if they wolde reuoke the decree whyche they hadde made agaynste the Megarens. By whyche they were forbydden, to aryue in the poortes of the Athenyans, and to come to thair markettes, and also to vse marchandise with them. To all whiche requestes, and specyally, touchinge the reuocatiō of the said decree, the Athenyans determyned not to obey. Alleaging agaynst them of Megare, that they occupied the holly and indeuided place, and that they receiued the frutes of Athens. Fynally, yet after all thies aunsweres, thre Ambassadours of the Lacedemonyans came agayne vnto them, to wytt, Raphius,Ramphius. MalesippusMalesippus. & Agesandrus,Agesandrus. who without makynge any mention of any of the othere matters, wherof had bene spokenne bifore, saide vnto them this wordes onely in substāce The Lacedemonyans arne mynded to haue peace with youe, the whyche youe maye haue, if youe suffer the Grekes in thair lybertie. Vpon whyche propositiō, the Athenyans, then caused the coūsaille of the cytie to assemble, for to determyne one tyme for all, of the aunswere, whych they had to make. Upon which matter after that many had shewed thair opynyons, the one that the warre shulde be accepted, the other that the decre against them of Megare shuld be reuoked, rather than by occasyon therof to haue warre, fynally Pericles the sonne of Xantippus,Pericles who was at that tyme the chefest man of the cytie, and most renommed, aswell in woorde, as in dede, stode vp and spake in this manner.
            
            
               
               ¶The speaking and opynyon of Pericles to the counsayle of the Athenyans, accordynge wherunto, the aunswere was made vnto the Lacedemonyans. The .xviii. Chapter.
               THough that I knowe, lordes Athenyans, that men make not warre with that same ardor & desire, that they enterprise yt, but accordinge to the cases that happenne, do change thair wylle: yet I contynue stil in my opynyon, not to geue place to the Peloponesians. For I do see this, wherof we must presently determyne, like & approchinge vnto that, whereof I haue had opynyon bifore this tyme. wherfore I thinke it a thinge reasonable, that they amonge youe, that shalbe of my aduyse, if there chaūce herafter any myschance against the comon opynyō of the people, that they ought than to excuse it. And if it happen well (as we do hope) not to iudge it thair prudence for yt it is so chaunced. For it is commonly sene, that the chaunse of thinges to comme, be as vncertayne, as thoughtes of men, which ys the reason, wherby if any thing, vnloked for, do chaunse vs, we accuse fortune. Nowe to come to the case wherof ys questyō, yt is very certayne, that the Lacedemonyās haue alwaies heretofore imagyned agaynste vs, & yet presently do imagyne. For though yt be spoken by our couenātes & treaties, that if there be any controuersie bitwene any amōg vs for any thynge, they ought to stande vnto the knowlaige or iudgemēt of other and in the meane tyme to continue in the estate and possession, that they be found in: yet they haue not demaunded that we shulde putt the causes, wherof the quarelle ys made, into iudgement & knolaige. But whā that we haue offred it them, they w
                     •
                  ld not accepte it. For that, that they loue better that quarels be auoyded by warre, than by wordes. And though yt seme that they come by manner of requeste, yet ys it by cōmandment. For they cōmande vs to departe frō Potyde, yt we suffre the Egynyans in thair lybertie, & that we reuoke the decree, that we haue made agaynst the Megar
                     •
                  ans. And they whych be last come, do cōmaunde vs that we suff
                     •
                  e the Grekes to lyue according to thair lawes. And to the intēt, that any among you do not thinke that the questiō ys of a smal matter, to witt to reuoke the sayd decre, wherupō they arrest most stifly, saying that in that doinge, we shall not haue warre, & likewise that it shuld be a great fault to enter into suche a warre for one so smal a matter, I aduertise you, that this smal affaire, conteigneth the consequence & the establishment of all the other thinges, where vpon my opyniō is groūded. For if you graūt thē this, they woll cōmaunde you incontinētly some other thing, more great, seing yt, for fear, you shal haue obeyde them in that. But if that youe refuse them & speake agaynst them sharpely with a good blowe, they shall knowe, that they oughte not to cōme by authoritie towardes you, but by amitie. as from like to like. wherfore I thinke that you must determyne aithere to obeye them bifore you haue receyued any inconuenience of warre, orels (whyche I repute to be the beste) to take the aduēture of the warre, rather thā to obey thē in any thing small or great. And so posses by thys meane that, whyche we holde alway in feare. For into as great bondage & subiection a man putteth himselfe by obeyinge to the comaundement of his Egalls & neyghbours without any iudgement, in a small matter, as in a great. And if yt be forced that we come to warre ye one against the other, euery wt all his power, there ys great apparance for him that woll naroly consider all thinges, that we shuld not haue the woorse. For furst the Peloponesyās be the more parte, handy craft

men & labourers, who haue no monney in general & veray litle in particuler. And also they haue not experyence of longe warres, & specially of those, that be made by sea. And euen whan they haue any warre amōg thēselfe, they may not cōtinue it long, by cause of thair pouertie. And if there be question to send to the sea, they haue no meane to replenishe thair shippes with men, nor yet to sende out a puissante armye by lande. For that, that by that meane they shulde eloigne or absent themselfe fro thair domesticall affayres and shulde lose thair exercise and māner of lyuinge. And furthermore youe knowe that warre ys more susteigned by ryches and ready monney, than by violent exactions. Nowe if we occupye or kepe the sea, they woll be more ready, being hādy craft people & labourers, to sarue wt thair bodies, than with mōney. Hoping that they may alwayes saue thair bodies fro daūgers of the warre, where they cannot excuse thēselfe to contribute to ye expēces of it, whā it shall be bigon vntil ye time that it shalbe acheued & ended. And for to speke of thinges passed, the Peloponesians haue bene egall to ye other Grekes in one onely battayle, but throughly to contynue warre, they haue not bene like vnto thē y• wer better prouided, thā they. For that they vse not one only coū
                  saille, but many. By occasyon whereof, that, whyche they haue to do, they do yt soubdaynely. And though they be much different of faculties, of power and of all other thynges, yet euery one man hath his opynyon, aswell the one, as the othere, and euery man tendereth his particuler proufytte, whereby it comethe not comonly, that any thynge ys done, that auaylethe. For if some be safly inclyned to fyght wyth any, and to ronne hym ouer, the other feare greatly to spende thair particuler good. And furthermore, for somuche as they come euyll willingly to thair common assembles, they determyne in a momente of tyme of thair generall affayres, and employe the more parte of tyme, to thair pryuate busynes. For euery one of them thynkethe that the comon wealthe shall not be endommaged by his absence, & yt they shall haue some ther, that shal do somuch for him, as if he were there. And by thys meane hauynge euery man thys opynyon towardes hymselfe, they parceyue not, that the common wealthe perishethe by them all togyders. And if at any tyme they delyberate to attende thereunto diligentely and at lengthe, they cannot for lacke of monney. And yet the affayres of warre nede no longe deliberations. And we must not feare thair edifices nor thair armye by sea. For as touchinge the edifices or buyldinges, though that they were in peace, yet shulde yt be very harde for them to make a towne so stronge, as thys here, and therfore they shal make yt much lesse in time of warre. And specyally there, where we shall make oure rampares and munytyons to the contrarie. And whan nowe they shall make agaynste vs a towne firmed or closed with walles, and that they shall strengthe yt with people, yt ys true that they maye endomage vs aswell in makynge courses and pillage in some places of our land, as in drawing to thair party some of our subiectes, yet by thair buildinges they shall not defende, that we go not into thair lande by sea, wherin we arne moste stronge. And also we haue by our contynuel excercise in the sea, more experience in the warre that ys made by lande, than they haue by vsage of the lande warre, in the fight or battayle by sea. To the whiche they cannot easely appoyncte nor frame themselues to be experte. For we ourselfe that haue contynuelly vsed this crafte, sens the warre of the Medes, be not therin parfaictly instructed. How shal they than do it, that were accustomed to laboure the lande, and not to trauaile the sea. And on the other parte, by hauinge contynually a great nōber of shippes, laying watche for them, we shal kepe thē well frō accustomyng thēselues to that busines, & fro doing any thing of importāce. And where as, not seing against thē,

but a smal nōber of shippes, they may (trusting to the great nōber of thaire people) take the aduenture to come to fight vpō the sea, whā they shall se that there shalbe a greate nomber on all sides, they woll saue thēselfe or exchue it. And by this meane, leuyng holy the vse of sailinge, they shall therin haue euery daye lesse knowlaige, & also shall bicome more ydle. For 
                     〈◊〉
                   arte of the sea, lyke as in all other, it is not suffycient to exercise himself wha

                  he hath no nother busynes, but it is required (for to knowe it wel) to do no othere exercyse, but that same there. And if it be sayde that by meane of the monney that they shall take in Olympus or in Delphos, that they may reteigne the huyred ma

                  onners that we haue, geuing them greater sould or wages: truely I saye that this shulde be a greuous thynge for vs, if we shuld not abide so strong of our people, namely which shuld be within our shippes, as they of thaire oune people, but we shall be as mightye, And that whiche more is, we haue patrones & other ministres by sea in greater nomber, than all the rēmenant of Grece hath. And also there is not he of the mercenaries or

                  uyred maronners that wol besyde the daunger wherin he shuld put himselfe, be vannished from our lande, hauinge specially lesse esperance and hope to proffitt on thaire syde, than of ours. Insomuche as though happely they do geue them greater wages, yt shall not be but for a veray short tyme. Thies thinges and other lyke, yt semeth to me mete, to shewe and reherce of the Pelo

                  onesians. I woll nowe shewe of vs that, which I vnderstande and parceyue.

                  e be for trouth exempted from the thinges that we obiecte against them. And also we haue many notable thinges that they haue not. For if they enter into our coūtrey by lande, we woll enter into thairs by sea, and so the dammage, that they shal do vnto vs, shal not be like vnto that same, that we shal do vnto them, for that that we woll destroy a great parte of Peloponese, and they cannot destroye but all the land of Athenes, for that that they haue no other countrey where as we may not make warre at our wille. where as we haue muche other landes, aswell in Islandes as in mayne lande. whiche they cannot warre vpon, by cause of thempire and of the puissance that we haue by sea, whiche ys a greate aduauntage. For it is to co
                     •
                  sider, that if we were in any Islande of the sea, we shulde be impregnable. Nowe ys it in our power (if we woll) to do as if we were Islanders, that ys to wy

                  t, to habandone and to holde for loste, all our townes and houses that we haue in the feldes in this lande of Athenes, and to kepe onely and to defende this cytie and the sea. And if the Peloponesians whiche be more people than we, do come to burne and destroy our howses & our landes, we shulde not, through anger and furye, ronne vpon them, nor fight agaynst them. For though that we shall haue defeated or ouercomme them at one tyme, they woll yet come againe in as greate nomber as bifore, for to destroye vs. And if one iourney mishappened vs, we shulde lose the ayde of all oure subiectes and allyes. For whan they vnderstande that we shall not be mightie for to go to assayle them by sea with a greate armye, they woll not passe muche for youe. And though peraduenture we shulde lose our townes and our landes for to saue our bodyes, we shuld not therfore lamente. For possessions do not g
                     •
                  tt men, but men acquire possessions. And if I thought, that youe wolde bileue me, I woulde coūsaille that you yourselues shuld go to destroy thē, for to cause knowlaige to be geuē to the Peloponesians, that youe arne not suche, as woll obey them, for sauing of them. I haue moreouer many other thynges by whiche you maye hope victorie, if youe wille. But youe must not, vntill that you shalbe in the defence, thinke to increase your seignyory, nor adde volūtary parills to the necessary, that you shal haue. For certaynly I feare not somuch the enterprises of our ennemys, as the faultes of our

oune people. Of y• which thinges I will not speake at this present. But I resarue it to speake whā we shalbe in affayre or busines. And to make an ende of my purpose, I thinke yt we shuld for this tyme sende our ambassadours to ye Lacedemonyans, and by them, to make aunswer, that we be content not to prohibite nor forbid vnto ye Megarens our portes & markets. Prouyded yt those Lacedemoniās do not prohibitt the vse of theyr citie to estraūgers no more, than vnto vs & our allyes. For that, which we do, is no more to ye derogatyō of our treaties and alliāces, thā ye, which they do. And touching the other dema

                  ̄de which they haue made, to suffre the cytyes of Grece in lybertie, we be therwt content, yf they were therin, from the tyme of the sayde treaties, & yf they be contente to restore theyr cytyes into suche lybertye, that they lyue accordynge to theyr particular lawes, as they woll, wythout that, that they be constrayned to kepe the lawes and ordenaunces of Laoconie, touchyng the gouernaunce of theyr commone affayres. And furthermore that we be content for all causes to stande to ryght and iudgement accordyng to the tenour of our allyances, wythout mouyng any warre, But yf we be assaulted, we woll take payne to defende vs. This aūswere semeth to me reasonable, y

To whom we ought not to be inferyours, but vertuously and valyantly, to resiste our ennemyes and to take payne not to suffre thys empyre to be lessened nor weakened otherwyse, thā we founde it. Thus spake Pericles. And the Athenyans reputynge hys counsayle to be good, ensuynge the same, caused a decre to be made. By whiche they appoincted Ambassadours for to go towardes the Lacedemonyans, to make them aunswere holy suche, as he had deuysed, whiche was in somme, to do nothynge of that, whiche they had commaunded, but to be well wyllynge to aunswere in a neutrall and indyfferent Iudgemente,, touchyng the thynges wherewyth they were charged. Thus the au

                  swere was made. And afterwardes they sente no Ambassade, the one to the other. Howebeit the causes of the dyfference that was betwene them before the warre, was the begynnynge of the thynges that had bene done in Epydanne and in Corcyre. Although that by reason therof, they ceased not they

               The fyrst Chapter.
               By the meanes and occasions. wherof we haue spokē before, the warre beginneth betwene the Athenyans & Peloponesians, and also the allies and consederates on both sydes. Which wēt forwarde cōtynually after that it was begōne, wythout yt they had any cōmunication of marchaundyse together, but by saulfconducte & by heraulte. Of the whiche warre we woll speake & reherse by order all yt was done in the same, aswell in tyme of sommer, as in tyme of wynter.The yeare whā ye warre dyd begynne. It beganne the .xv. yeare after thappoinctment and treatye, that they had made for .xxx. yeares, thā as they conquered Eubee. And it was the .xlviii. yeare of the priesthode of Chrysis in the cytye of Argos. In the whiche Enesius was Ephore in Sparte, and Pythodorus gouerned than at Athenes for one moneth. Sixe monethes after the battayle, which was made at Potyde, in the begynnyng of the furst spring tyde. At whiche tyme certayne Thebayns, to the nomber of thre houndred vnder conducte of two the chefest men of the countreye of Beoce, to wyt, Pythangelus, sonne of Phylide, and Dyemporus sonne of Onetorydes, entred secretely by nyght, after the furst sleepe, into the cytye of Platee, whiche is in the countrey of Beoce, but than it was confederated wyth the Athenyans by meane and intelligence of some of the cytye, that opened for them the gates, to wytt, Nauclides and hys accomplices, who wolde haue delyuered the sayde cytye vnto the Thebayns. hopynge by that meane, to destroye some of the cytezeins theyr ennemys, and moreouer to make theyr partycular proffit. the which had treated that practique, by the meane of Eurymachus, sonne of Leontiades, that was the princypall and rychest man of Thebes. Also the Thebains who well perceyued that in all euentes, warre shulde be begonne agaynst the Athenyans, wolde gladlye, before that it were declared, haue taken that towne, which alwayes had bene theyr ennemye. For by that meane the thyng was more easy to doo. Also they entred without y• any parsone parceyued it, for that there was nayther watche nor warde in the cytye, and they came wythoute makynge any noyce vpon the market place of the cytye. Beyng in whiche place, they were not of opynyon to execute that, whiche they had graunted to them of the towne that had brought them in, to wytt, to go to fourrage the houses of theyr ennemys, but they deuysed to cause to be proclaymed through the towne wyth sounde of trompet, that they that wolde be allyes of the Beotiens, and lyue accordinge to theyr lawes, shulde cōme thyder & bringe their harnoies, trustinge by this meane to reduce thē without any difficultie, y• were citezeins, to their intente. Who vnderstāding yt the Thebaynes were in their citie, & thinking yt they had ben in greater nōber for that, that they dyd not see thē bycause of the nyght: they accepted their party, & came to parlamēt wt them, & seyng that they wold innouate no thing wt thē, they retourned into their houses in good agremēt. But incontynently after,

perceyuinge that they were so fewe people, they deuysed, that they might easelye defeate and ouercome them, yf they set vpon them. So they determined to assay it. For they departed agaynste theyr wyll from the allyance of the Athenyans. And to thintent that theyr banquett shulde not be parceyued by theyr assemblye in the stretes, they persed incontynently the walles, whiche parted theyr houses, and passynge from the one to the other wythin a shorte tyme they were all togeders. Afterwardes they tourned theyr charettes ouerthwart the stretes, for to serue them for rampartes, and made all other prouysyons, suche as they thought reasonable and conuenyent according to the tyme. And after that they had ordeyned theyr case, accordyng as they had hadde leasure, and made moreouer watche all that nyght, aboutes one houre before daye, they yssued oute of theyr houses, and came to sett vpon the Thebayns. altogeders that yet were in the sayde market. Fearyng that yf they assayled them in the day, that they wold haue defended themself better and more hardly, than they wolde do in ye night, beyng in a place, wherof they had not well the practyse, lyke as it happened. For seyng that they were deceyued of theyr thoughte, and that they were assaulted, they dyd furste ioygne themself all together. and parforced ones or twies themselues all with one strength for to passe through some strete, but they were alwayes dryuen backe. And than parceyuing the bruyte that men made vpō thē, aswell they that assayled them, as also the women, the chyldren and other people vnmete to fyghte, who casted stones and tyles from the houses vpon them: they were so astonyed (together with that, that it rained very sharply that night) that they fledde through the stretes, so as they coulde wythout knowynge the more parte, whyder they wente, aswell by meane of the nyght, as also that they had not practyse of the towne. And so they were empesched for to saue them, by those, that pursued them, whereby many were slayne. By this chiefly, that one of the citezeins came to the gate wherein they were entred, whiche onely was open and dyd shut it, castynge the shalte of a dart ouerthwarte the locke in stede of a barre. So that they coulde not passe fourth that waye, and so, some mounted vpon the walles, and threwe themselfe from a hyghe, downe to the grounde, the more parte of whome dyed. Some other came to haue passed at an other gate, wherat there was no warde, and with a hatchet that a woman deliuered them, brake the locke and yssued fourthe. But there coulde not passe any greate nōber, for that, that the thynge was incontynently knowen. The other were beaten donne in the stretes. But the greater parte and chyefly those, that were wygned togeders, came to rushe into a greate edifyce or house which was wignyng to ye walles of the towne, wherof they founde, by chaunse of aduenture, the dore opē. Thynkyng that it was one of the gates of the towne, and that they myght saue themself by the same. And than the cytezeins, seing that they al were closed with in, were in dyfference, whyther they shulde set it in fyer for to burne them all together, or that they shulde cause them to dye of an other sorte. But fynally they there, and all the other that were yet wythin the towne, rendred themself wyth theyr armure to the wille of the cytezeins. Durynge that these thynges were done in the cytye of Platee, the other Thebayns, that shulde with a greate bende haue folowed all the nyght, those, that were furste entred, for to succour them, yf it were nede, had in theyr waye newes, how they were assayled. So they hasted them, the most that they myght, for to cōme to theyr succoure. But they coulde not aryue sone ynough. For there is frome Thebes to Platee .lxx. stades, and the great rayne that was fallen that nyght, had greately kepte them backe. For the ryuer of Asopus,The ryuer of Asopus which they must passe, was by cause of the sayd rayne not easy

to be gaged. In suche sorte, that whan they were passed, they were aduertysed, howe theyr people that taryed within, were all deade or taken. So they deuysed amonge them to take the paysans of Platee, that were without the cytie (wherof there was a great nomber) together with a great quantyte of beastes and of moueables, for that, that there were yet no newes of warre, to thintent to buy agayne (by meane of those there that they shulde take) them of theyr people, that were yet within the towne, and that were lyuynge. And they being in thys delyberation, the Plateans which greatly doubted the selfe thynge, sente with dylygence a herault vnto them. Shewynge that they had done nought, to go aboute durynge the peace, soubdaynely to take theyr cytye. And neuertdeles to shewe & denounce vnto them, that yf they dyd any euyll to theyr citezeins that were in the feldes, they wolde slaye all them that they had prysonners in the towne, but yf they departed oute of theyr lande wythout doynge anye harme, they wolde render them vnto them in lyfe. and thervpon they made theyr othe, as the Thebayns dyd saye. But the Plateans saye, that they promysed them not symplye for to render them the sayde prysonners incontynently, but onely, yf they agrede with them, after that they had spokenne together, and that wythoute makynge any othe. But howe so euer it was, the Thebayns dyd retourne into theyr citye, without doyng any euyll in the terrytory of ye Plateens. And yet those Plateēs dyd incontynently wtdrawe the persones, & the goodes that they hadde in the feldes. And after caused the prysonners that they hadde to dye, which were about nyne skoore. Among whom was Eurymachus, who admynystred the practyse of the trahyson. And thys done, they rendred vnto the Thebayns, theyr deade men, and fournyshed theyr cytye wyth that, that they thought necessarye for the tyme. The Athenyans, whan they had harde what was done at Platee, gaue order to cause to be takenne all the Beotians that were founde in the countreye of Athenes. And fourthwyth sente towardes the Plateens a trompet to defend or commaunde them that they shulde do no euyll nor dyspleasure to them that they had prysonners, vntyl suche tyme, as it were deuysed, what shulde thervpō be done. For they were not yet aduertised that they were slayne, for that, that the furst messenger, that came vnto them, departed frome Platee at the begynning, as the Thebayns were entred, the seconde after that they were vainquyshed and taken, and than they sente theyr trompett. Who whan he was arryued, founde that the prysonners were all slayne. Anone after, the Athenyans came thyder with theyr armye or hoste, and brought corne for to victuayle the towne. And wt that, lefte there a good garnysone of men of warre, and ledde away with them, women, chyldren, and other people vnmete for the defence.
            
            
               ¶ The great preparation that was made aswell on the behalfe of the Athenyans, as of that same of the Peloponesyans, and the Cities, that toke parte with the one syde, and wyth the other. The .ii. Chapter.
               THese thynges thus done at Platee, as we haue sayde, the Athenians, seynge manyefestly that the treuse was brokenne, prepared thēselfe, to make warre. And the Lacedemonyans and theyr allyes, dyd the lyke, & so they determyned, aswell on the one syde, as of ye other,

to sende towardes the Kynge of Mede. And the other straungers, of whom they hoped to haue any succoure, and also to the cytyes, that were oute of theyr obeysance for to drawe them to theyr allyance. And chiefly the Lacedemonians gaue charge vnto the cytyes of Italy, and of Sycille that toke theyr parte, to make shyppes accordynge to theyr possibilytye (besydes those, that they hadde) to the nomber of fyue honndred in all. And moreouer that they shulde fournyshe a certayne some of monneye, without declaring to them, the other matters, but that they shulde not receyue into theyr portes more than one shyppe of Athenes at a tyme, vntyll that all the apparaylle were ready. Lykewyse the Athenyans on theyr syde sente Ambassadours furste, to all the cytyes, that were of theyr obeysance. And afterwardes to the other, that were nyghe to Peloponese, to wytte, to Corcyre, to Cephanalie, to Acarnanye and to Zacynthe.zacynthus, For they parceyued well, that yf the sayde cityes were in good amytie with them, they myght more easely ronne by sea rounde aboute Peloponese. And in effecte they thoughte not of one thyng, of 
                     •
                  he one sydenor of the other, which was not wayghtye. And also they enterprysed not the warre of any other sorte, nor more coldelye, than was conuenyent for people of suche renomme. For also at begynnynge, all people be most hotte to defende them selues. whereby it happened that many yonge men, aswell of Athens, as of Peloponese, were not greatly dyspleased with the warre, for that, that they had not experymented nor proued it. And also all the other cities of Grece were anymated to warre, seynge that the princypall were therunto enclyned. Moreouer there were made dyuers pronostications. And the aunsweres and oracles of the Goddes, were reaported in dyuers sortes, not onely in cities that were tangled with this same warre, but also in the other, And it chaū
                  ced amonge other thynges, that the temple of Delos trembled, whiche thynge was neuer sene, to the remembraunce of the Grekes, and by the newe or strange thynges that were parceyued, men iudged of thynges, that were to comme. By meane wherof, all those fantasyes were curyously searched and inquyred of. But so muche was it, that the people generally had more affection to the Lacedemonyans, than vnto the Athenyans. For that chiefly, that they sayde, yt they wolde restore all Grece into lybertye. By reason wherof, they aduaunced them selfe all, aswel in common, as in particuler to ayde them, with suche affection, as it semed to euery one, that yf he were not there, the thynge shulde be empesched through hys faulte. And many there were, that were dyspleased, and not well contented wyth the Athenyans. Some for that theyr empyre was taken from them, and the other fearynge to come into theyr subiectyon. In thys manner they prepared themself, both with harte and apparayle aswell on the one syde, as on the other. And the cytyes that toke partye, wyth the Lacedemonyans, were all the Peloponesyans that arne wythin the distrayte, excepte the Argiues, and the Achayans, who were frendes, aswell of the one, as of the other. And there were not of the sayde Achayans at begynnynge, but the Pellians, that toke part with the Peloponesians. But afterwardes all the other dyd take it. And oute of Peloponese were of thys partye, the Megarens, the Phocyens, the Locryās, the Beotiens, the Ambrotiates, the Lewcadyans and the Anactoryans. Of whō the Corinthians, the Megarens, the Sycyonyans, the Pellyans, the Hellyans, the Lewcadyans and the Ambracyens fournyshed shyppes, the Beotians, Phocyans and the Locryens, horsmen, and the other fote men. And this is concernynge the Peloponesyans. On the partye of the Athenyans, were they of Chio, of Lesbos, of Platee, and the Messenyans, that be in Naupactus,
Naupactus. manye of the Acarnanyens, the Corcyryans, the zacynthians, and the other that were their

tributours, amonge whome were the Carians, whiche be farre beyonde sea, and Dorians, that be ioyning vnto them, the coūtrey of Ionū and that same of Hellesponte, many places of Thrace, and all the yslandes, that be out of Peloponese and of Crete on the parties of, le soleil leuant which be called Ciclades, resarued Melo and There. Of whome the Lesbyans and the Corcyryans fournyshed shyppes, and the other footemen. These were the allyes and consequentes, and also the preparations of the one partye, and of the other. The Lacedemonyans, after that they vnderstode the chaunce that was happened at Platee, commaū
                  ded all theyr allyes, that they shuld kepe theyr people ready, with apparayl that were necessarye for to issue vnto the felde at a daye named, and to enter into the countrey of Athenes. And after that thys was done, two partes of all the cyties mett at one tyme, in ye destraict of Peloponese, that is called Isthmos, and sone after, all the other arryued there. who beyng there all assembled, Archidamus kynge of the Lacedemonyans, who was generall or chief of the armye, called vnto hym all the offycers and pryncipallest of all the cytyes, and spake vnto them in thys manner.
            
            
               The narration of Archidamus Kynge of Lacedemonians. ☞The thyrde Chapter.
               LOrdes Peloponesyans, and youe other oure allyes, oure auncestres haue had manye warres, and made manye armyes, aswell wythin the countreye of Peloponese, as wythout, and those amonge vs that be aged, haue some experyence. Yet we neuer yssued to the felde so puyssant, nor with so greate apparayle for warre, as at thys present. Also we go agaynste a ryght myghtye cytye, where there is lykewyse a great nō
                  ber of good warryours. Wherfore we must shewe vs suche, that we destayne not the glorye and renome of oure elders, and of oure selues. For all Grece is moued for thys warre, and the more parte, do long loke for our victorye, for the hatred that they haue to the Athenyās. neuertheles we must not (for that we be in right great nomber, & go agaynst our ennemyes in great hope, yt they dare not yssue agaynst vs) leaue nor omyt any thynge of oure apparaylle, but it is necessarye, that euery one of vs aswell capytayne as conductor and souldyer be alwayes in feare to fall into any danger throughe hys faulte. For the feate of warre is alwayes doubtfull. And men fyght ryght oftentyme for a small matter and for dysdayne. And many tymes the smaller nomber, for the feare that it had, hath vainquyshed the greater, that contempnynge the ennemyes, kepte not hys order. Wherfore it is conuenyent, whan we shall enter into the lande of oure ennemys, to be ready and hardy, but whan it shall comme to the dede, men must prepare themselues in feare. which doyng, we shalbe more ready for to assayle our ennemys, and more assured to fyght. And also we muste thinke. that we go not agaynste a cytye weake and vnprouyded, so that it cannot reuenge him selfe, but agaynst the cytye of Athenes, which is prouyded of all thynges. And that they be people for to yssue agaynst vs. But at begynnynge, as we shal enter into their lande, by all meanes, as to theyr syghte, we woll ennemylike bourne & pyllage it. For al people, that soubdaynely parceyue any thyng not accustomed, to be done

theyr dommage, be moued to wrath and anger. And those, that do not theyr thynges by reasone, ryght oftentymes do ouerthrowe themselues in the affaire, as holy furious and madde. And it is to beleue, that the Athenyans do it more, than other people, for that that they thinke, that it apperteigneth to thē, to gouerne other, and to destroye the lande of other men, rather, than they shuld come to destroye theyrs. Wherfore you must followe them, that shall conducte youe in thys enterpryse, in great esperance of victorye, aswel for the vertue and reputacyon of oure auncestres, as also for ours. And neuertheles hauynge regarde that youe go agaynste a ryght puyssant cytye, y
                     •
                  ue holde youe alwayes affected and prouyded for all chaunces, that might comme. And moreouer haue alwayes in remembraunce to be appoincted as apperteigneth euery man for himself, and furthermore to kepe youe well, and to execute redely that, that youe shalbe commaunded. For it is a fayer thynge and of a greate suertie for a greate bende, where there is great nomber of people, to see them al appoincted with one obedyence. After that Archidamus had this spoken and that the counsayle was resolued, he sente again Melesippus,Melesippus
                        •
                     
                   sonne of Diacrytus of Sparte, to Athenes, for to vnderstande, yf they wolde not speake more humbly, perceyuinge the enemies ready to enter into theyr lande. But they wolde not admyt the sayde Melesyppus into theyr senate, nor yet into theyr cytye. But sente hym from thence agayne wythoute hearynge, for that, that the opynyon of Perycles was greatest, by whiche it was sayde, that heraulde nor Ambassadoure shulde be receyued frō the enemyes, sence that they were yssued in armes agaynste them. And also they caused to be commaūded to the sayde Melesyppus, to departe theyr lande within a daye, and to saye to them that had sente hym thyder, that they shulde not sende agayne vnto them, any parsone, excepte furste that they were retourned into theyr countrey. And moreouer gaue hym people for to conducte him backe through theyr countreye, and to kepe hym, that he spake to no man. Who beyng comme to the borders of theyr countreye so, as they that conducted hym, wolde lycence hym, he spake vnto them, these wordes wythoute more. Thys iourney shalbe begynnyng of many greate euyls in Grece. And after that he was come agayne to the campe, Archidamus, vnderstandynge that the Athenyans had nothynge asswaged of theyr hygh courayge, caused hys armye to dis
                     •
                  odge and entred into the lande of Athenyans. And on the other syde, the Beotiens into the lande of Platee, & pyllaged it wyth an other bende. For the Lacedemomonyans had departed to the Peloponesyans one parte of the hoste, and thys was done before, that the other were all assembled in the destrait of Peloponese. And this much to shew howe they assembled, to enter into the lande of Athenes.
            
            
               
               Howe after the perswation and exhortacyon of Pericles to the warre, the Athenyans that dwelled in the feldes, wythdrewe them selfe and theyr goodes into the cytye, and dysposed them selfe vnto the affayres of the warre. ☞The .iiii. Chapter.
               WHan Pericles sonne of Xantyppus, the tenth Duke of Athenyans, vnderstode that the ennemyes were entred into the sayde lande, doubtyng hym selfe for that, that Archidamus had bene lodged in hys house, yt he wolde defende to hys people that they shulde do no dammage to the landes and houses, that he had without, eyther for curtesye and of hymselfe, or elles by commaundement of the Lacedemonyans, for to put that same Perycles into suspytion of the people, as they were lately minded to do, demaundyng that he shulde be dryuen oute of the cytye for to pourge the sacrilege wherof hath bene spoken, he aduaunced hymself therof to speake to the assemblye of the cytye, Declarynge vnto them, though Archidamus had ben hys geste, yet that shulde not redounde to the dommage of the cytye. And that yf it chaunced that the houses and possessyons of other cytezeins were burned, & yt hys were presarued, he wolde geue them vnto the cōmunaltye. to the entente that no suspytyon shulde be conceyued agaynst hym for that matter. And so he exhorted more ouer the people,The substance of the exhortacyon of Pericles to the Athenyans. as he had done before, to be ready and apparayled for the warre, to brynge all theyr moueable goodes into the cytye, to prepare theyr shyppes and other munytyons by sea, wherof they were most puyssante, & to enterteigne into theyr amytie, theyr allyes and confederates, from whom they had monney, for that, that the victorye chiefly cometh in feate of warre, by force of monney, and by good conducte and admynistration. shewynge them furdermore that they shulde haue greate confydence in the reuenue that they leuyed yerely by fourme of tribute vpon theyr subiectes and confederates, which amoū
                  
                     •
                  ted to six houndred talentes, ouer and aboue the other reuenues, that they had in generall. And lykewyse they shulde truste to the ready monney whiche they presently hadde in theyr Castelle
                     •
                   to the somme of sixe thousande talentes. For althoughe that they hadde had for the most, tenne thousande, three lesse, yet the reste was spente at the erectyng of the castell of Propilee, and for other buyldinges, and also for the warre of Potidee. And also they hadde besyde thys, greate quantyte of golde and syluer not coigned in dyuers kyndes, aswell in generall, as in particular, besydes the halowed vessels and other ornamentes of temples, and that, which was deputed to the pompe of playes, and besyde that, that they hadde wonne of the spoyle of the Medes, and many lyke thynges, whiche amoū
                  ted vnto no lesse than fyue houndred talentes. And besydes all that, there were many greate sommes of money in the temples, wherewith they might helpe themselfe in necessitie, and in extremytie. whan the reste shulde fayle, they might take the golde, wherwith the great Goddesse Dyana was couered, which amoū
                  teth, as it is sayde to fourty pounde wayght of talentes all fyne golde & massis. which, it shulde be laufull to take, for conseruatyon of the comon wealthe, in rendryng it alwayes intierly, after the warre. In suche manner he exhorted them to haue good hope, that monney shulde not fayle them. And concernynge the force of people, he shewed them, that they hadde thyrtene thousande warryours, besides those that were deputed to the kepynge of places, and of walles and forteresses, whiche amounte vnto .xvi. thousande. For so many there were that kepte

watche and warde in the sayde places, from begynnynge, that the enemyes came into theyr lande, comprehended the olde and the yonge, and also the straungers, that dwelled in the towne, all bearynge armure. Also they had to kepe the walle, whiche is called Phalerius, whiche extendeth itself frome the walles of ye towne vntyll the sea, conteignyng .xxxv. houndred stades, of lengthe. And the walles in that, which was warded, conteigne .xlin. of cyrcuyte. For yt (which was betwene the sayde walle Phalerie and the other, that is called the great walle, whiche lykewyse extendeth it selfe vntyll the sea, conteignynge fourty stades in lengthe) was not subiecte to warde, the sayde two walles beynge well kepte, yt were without the cytye. And moreouer there was to warde the forteresse of the gate, that is called Pyreus, which comprehendynge the other adioyninge, that is called Munychie, conteigneth threskore stades in circuyte, the moytie wherof was watched holy by footemen. And for thys they had .xii. houndred men at armes, and sixtene houndred arbalestrers, all horsemen. Suche was thapparaile of the Athenyans for trouthe withoute anye thynge therevnto added, whan the Peloponesyans entred into theyr lande. Perycles made vnto them many other remonstraunces and declarations, suche, as he had accustomed, for to geue them to vnderstande, that they shulde haue the better of that same warre. After whiche persuasyons, they wente all for to fatche theyr goodes into the citye. And afterwardes sent by sea, theyr wyues, theyr chyldren, theyr moueables, theyr vtensyles and instrumentes, the woode of the buyldynges, that they had beaten downe, and theyr cattell into Eubee, and into other yslandes nexte adioynynge. Whiche thynge was odible vnto them, for that a longe tyme, a greate parte of them inhabyted the feldes, where they kepte their housholde. For suche was alwayes the custome of the Athenyans, more, than of other people from the furst beginnyng of the citie. And from the time specyally of Cecrops and of other furst kynges, vntyll Theseus, the countreye of Athenes was inhabyted by vyllages & boroughs, and euery vyllage had hys courte and hys offycers. For that, that lyuing insuertie & without warre, they neded not to come to theyr kynges for to cō
                  
                     •
                  sulte vpō cōmon affayres, no, though there were some, yt made warre amōge thē, as the Eleusins,Eleusinii. after that Enolphus

                  oyned him self with Erechthus.

                     Erechteus.
                   But after ye Theseus came to the kingdom, who was a man puyssaute & wytty, besydes yt, that he reduced and refourmed through ciuilitie & pollecy many other thynges in the said countrey, he abolyshed all his small officers, & the courtes of the villages & bouroughes, and caused the people to drawe into the cytye, which at thys presente, be all vnder one counsaille, & vnder one courte. And constrayned thē al, laborynge their landes, as before, to chose & haue theyr ordinary house, in ye same citie generally. which citie hauyng in his time made great & well ordered, he left it by successyon vnto them that came after, from hande to hande. Wherby for remembraunce of the same goodnes, at suche daye, as that same assemblye and vnyon of the cytye was made, the Athenians do yet at this present celebrate a solempne feast yearly in the honour of the goddesse. For before that, the citie conteigned not but ye same, which is now the castel, & that, that is aboue on the south syde, lyke as the tēples of the other gods do wytnes, which be within the sayde castell, and the other that be wtout of the south syde, as ye same of Iupiter, Olimpyā of Pythe, of Tellus & of Bacchus. Unto whom was yearely celebrated the feast Bacchanal the tenth day of the moneth Antesterion,Anthesterion. lyke as the Ionyans, who be descēded of ye Atheniās, do yet at this presēt holde it for trouth. And many other aūcient tēples there be in ye same place, wherin also is the fountayne yt is called now, sence the rulers haue appointed it, the newe cōduictes. which auncyently was called Calliroe.Calliroe And men vsed it for that, that it was nyghe the place

in all great thynges. Whereby yet at thys presente, the opynyon of the people is, that it shulde be vsed in sacrifices, specyally in those, that be made for maryages. And that parte of the cytye, that is aboue the castell in the hyghest parte of the towne, is yet at thys daye by the Athenyans called the cytye, for memory of the antiquite. For to retourne than to oure purpose, the Athenyans, that at begynnynge dwelled in the feldes at theyr playsyr, though that afterwardes they were reduced and brought to the cytye, yet for the custome that they hadde for to dwelle in the feldes, contynued there the more parte wyth theyr housholde, aswell of the auncyentes, as of the newe citezeins vntyll thys present warre. By reasone wherof, it was very greuous and not easye for them to drawe into the towne. And so muche the more, that after the warre of the Medes, they had brought chyderall theyr moueables. And on the other parte, it greaued thē greatly and was molestuous, that they shuld leaue theyr temples and theyr particular Goddes, whiche they hadde in the vyllages and 
                     •
                  ouroughs. whiche for the auncyent vsage that they hadde to sacrifyce there, they reputed them to be theyr parte. And also it was mete for them to leue and chaunge all theyr manner of lyuynge. Whereby in effecte it semed vnto euerye of them by departynge from theyr vyllages, that they habandoned theyr citie. And after that they were come wythin the cytye, there were veray fewe that had houses. Afterwardes, some of them wente vnto theyr parentes and frendes, the other and the more parte lodged themselues in places of the citye not inhabited, & in all the temples, reserued those, that were in the hygh cytye of Eleusine. and some other, whiche were surelyer shutt and kept. And also there were that lodged themself wythin the tēple named Pelasgeque, which was all aboue the olde cytie, though that it were not laufull to dwell there, lyke as it was conteygned in the ende of a verse of an aunswere of Apollo Delphicque. whiche sayde in thys manner. The temple Pellasgeque shall kepe most comodyouslye the reste. But to my iudgement that same aunswere came to the contrarye of that, that men vnderstode by it. For the calamytie chaunced not to the cytye, for that, that the temple was prophane by the habitacyon of the people, as some woll vnderstande it, but to the contrarye the necessytye to dwell there, came through the calamyte of the warre. For the oracle of the Godde, foreseynge the warre that shulde comme, shewed before, that whan men shulde inhabyt there, it shulde not be for any goodnes. Manye also lodged them selfe wythin the towers of the walles. And for conclusyon, euery one lodged hymselfe there, where he myght. For the cytye made them no empeschement, seynge so greate a nomber of people to be comme oute of the feldes. But a
                     •
                  terwardes, they were lodged vpon the longe walle, and in a greate parte of Pyreus. After that the people and the goodes were wythdrawē into the cytye, they were all geuen and attentyue to prouyde for thynges, apperteygnynge to warre. Specyally to cause the succours of the townes subiected and confederated, to assemble, to make ready and tacle an houndred shyppes. which they wolde sende to Peloponese. In thys manner the Athenyans were busyed in the feate of warre.
            
            
               
               Howe the Peloponesians intred furste into the lande of Athenes, and the pyllages that there were made. And howe the Athenyans by the wysedome of Pericles, were empesched to yssue forth, reserued the horsemen, whiche were repoulsed and dryuen backe agayne. ☞The .v. Chapter.
               THe hoste of the Peloponesyans comming into the lande of Athenes, they mynded to lodge furste in the towne of Enoe,Oenoe. whiche is vpon ye borders, betwene Athenes, and Beoce. And for that, that the towne was strongely walled, into the whiche the Athenyans retyred in tyme of warre, the Peloponesians determined to take it by batterye. For thys cause, they made engyns to be sett vp for batterie: but for that, yt it was longe tyme in doing, they had great suspytyō agaynst Archidamus, that he was fauourable to the Athenyās. For also they thought that he hadde ben eneglygent in causyng the confederates to assemble, and that he had coldly encouraged the armye. And after that it was assembled, that he taryed longe in the destraicte of Peloponese, before he departed, and more, that after hys departure, that he came very softly. but aboue all, they complayned of that, that he hadde bene so longe before Enoe. And they thought, that yf he had vsed dylygence, they hadde (entrynge readely into the lande of Athenes) pyllaged all the goodes, that the Athenyans had brought into the cytye. In suche suspytyon was Archidamus at the assiege of Enoe, who as men saye, caused it to be protracted at length, hopynge that the Athenyans, before that theyr lande shulde be begonne to be wasted and destroied, wolde come fourthe, rather, than to see it destroyed before theyr eyes. But af
                  
                     •
                  er that the Peloponesyans had done all theyr beste for to take Enoe, seyng that there was no hope to do it, and also that the Athenyans had not sente anye heraulde nor message vnto them, they departed from thence about fourskoore daies after that, which had bene done by the Thebayns at Platee. and entredde into the countreye of Athenes in the tyme of sommer, the corne beyng rype in the feldes, vnder the conducte of Archidamus kynge of Sparte. And vainquyshed all the sayde lande, begynnynge in the quarter of Eleusine and of Triasie. and also dyd repoulse and dryue backe the horsemen of the Athenyans, that were come fourthe vpon them, into a place that is called Rithie. Afterwardes, they passed more further, hauyng on the ryght hande the mountaygne of Egaleon,The mountaygne of Egaleon. ouerthwart the regyon called Cecropie, and came vntyll Acarne,Archarna. whiche is the greatest towne that is in all the regyon of Athenes, before the which they layde theyr assiege, and there they were long, pyllagynge and destroying the coūtrey. It is said that Archidamus kept hym selfe abowtes the towne wyth all the armye in battayle, as for to fyght, and wolde not descende into the playne, fearyng that ye Athenyans, who had so great nōbre of yonge people, more encouraged to warre, than euer they had before, wolde come to ouerrunne them, and coulde not endure to see theyr lāde, so wasted & pillaged. And whan he yet did see, that they were not come fourth, the ennemyes, beinge in Eleusine and after in Trasie he mynded to assaye, yf they durst comme to rayse the siege from before Acarne, considery
                     •
                  g also that the place was very propyce and mete for to lodge & soiourne hys campe. Also he thought, that they of the towne, that were well the thyrde parte o
                     •
                   Athenes (for there were thre thousande all men of warre) wolde not suffer t

                  em wyllyngly to waste theyr terrytorye, & for that cause, all together wolde c
                     •
                  mme fourth, aswell from Athenes, as from Acarne for to geue them battayle.

And yf they came not fourthe, that than men might, from thence forwardes wt lesse feare, waste and burne all the territory of Athens. And comme to the walles of the towne. For whan the Acarnes shulde haue sene all theyr lande wasted and theyr goodes lost, they shulde not be so determyned nor so ready to put thēselfe in daunger for to kepe the landes and the goodes of other. And by thys meane they shulde be of dyuers opynyons. Suche was the fantasye of Archidamus, beynge before Acarne. But the Athenyans, whyles the ennemys were aboutes Eleusine and in the lande of Triasie, they hadde some opynyon that they wolde passe no further. For that, that they remembred that .xiiii. yeares before ye warre, Plistonactus,Plistonax. sonne of Pausanias kynge of Lacedemonyans, beynge entred into the lande of Athenes wyth the hoste of Peloponesyans, whan he was come to the sayde countreys of Eleusyne and of Trias
                     •
                  e, passed no further, but retourned. Throughe occasyon wherof after hys retourne, he was reiected and bannyshed from the cytye of Sparte, for that, that it was suspected, that he had taken monneye for to retourne. But whan the Athenyans vnderstoode that the hoste of ennemys was before Acarne, whiche was not distant, but .lx. slades from the cytye, and that they sawe before theyr yes theyr terrytorye wasted, which thyng neuer mā of the towne, yonge nor olde had sene, but at the warre of Medes, they thought it a thynge to muche intollerable and not to be suffred. And so they were determyned, specyally the yonge people, no longer to indure it, but to ys
                     •
                  ue forth vpon the ennemyes. Whervpon the people beynge assembled vpon the markett, there was amonge them a great altercation. For some wolde that they shulde yssue fourth wyth all theyr force, the other wolde not suf

                  re it, the dyuynours also vnto whome men repayred on all sydes for to knowe theyr opynyon, reaported dyuers Iudgementes and dyuers dyuynations. On thoder syde, the Acarnanyans, seynge that theyr lande was wasted, laboured greatly the Athenyans to sett fourthe, and they thoughte that they oughte to do it, for to succoure theyr people, that were wythin Acarne in greate nomber. In thys manner the cytye was in greate tumulte and dyssentyon of all sydes. and were angry against Perycles, and spake vnto hym many iniuryous wordes, for that, that he wolde not leade them fourthe beynge theyr duke, saying that he was cause of all theyr euylle. wythoute remembrynge that, whiche he had counsayled and shewed thē, before the warre, But he, seyng that they were astonyed for the hurtes that they dyd see in theyr lande, and that they had euyll opynyon, in wille to go fourthe agaynst raysone, he wolde not assemble them, nor make declaration as he was accustomed to do. Fearynge that they wolde make some determynation, more throughe anger, than by reason, but gaue order to kepe the towne, and to holde it quyet, the moste that myght be. And neuertheles, he caused the horsmen to yssue fourthe for to defende, that those that came frome the campe of the ennemies for to runne before the cytye, myght not cary away the goodes, that were aboutes it. And there was a small conflict in the quarter, that is called, Phrigie, betwene a bende of the sayd horsmen Athenyans, the Thessalyans ioyned wyth them, and those of the Beotyens. Wherein the sayde Athenyans and Thessalyens had not the worste, vntyll that the fotemen B

And there were some of the deade men that were caryed awaye into the cytye, the selfe same daye wythoute demaundynge them of the ennemyes. And the morowe after, the Peloponesyans erected and sett vp a trophee vpon the place in token of the v

Of the whiche succours, the Capytaynes were, Polymedes and Aristanus for Larisse,Polymedes. Ariston. Menō for Pharsale,Menon and other for euery one of the sayd cyties. Whan the Peloponesians did se, that the Athenyans came not fourth to battaile againste them, they did breake vp from bifore Acarne, and came to pyllaige & ouerronne certain other villages that were betwene Parneth and the mountaygne of Brilesse.
            
            
               ¶ Of many exploictes of warre that the Athenyans dyd, aswelle by sea, as by lande, the sommer that the warre biganne and the wynter followynge, togidres with certayne allyaunces and newe amyties, that they made in Thrace and in Macedonie, and fynally, of the publique exequies or obyt that they celebrated at Athenes for thē that were dead in that same warre. ☞The .v. Chaptre.
               DNringe the tyme that the Peloponesyans fouraged and wasted the countrey of Athenes, the Athenyans caused to departe frō thair porte the hoūdred shippes, that they had apparai
                     •
                  led, wherin were a thousande men armed and foure houndred Archers vnder the conduccte of Carcynus,Carcynus. sonne of Xenotymus, of Protheas,Protheas. sonne of Epicles and of Socrates,Socrates. sonne of Antigenus, for to go to ouerronne rounde aboutes Peloponese. Who, beinge departed from the poorte with greate preparation, cōmytted thē
                  selfe vnto the sayle. As concernynge the Peloponesyans, they abodde in the land of Athenes, so longe as they had victuailes. And whan they beganne to faile thē, they retourned through the coūtrey of Beotyās, without doing ther any harme. But in passing through the countrey of Oropes, who were subiectes of the Athenyans, they pyllaged one quarter named Pyrace, & that done, retourned euery man into Peloponese and so into his house. After they were departed, the Athenyans dyd ordeyne their wardes, aswell by sea, as by lande, for all the tyme, that the warre shulde endure. And by comon decree, kepte a thousande talentes of thē that were in the fortresse of the olde
cytie, and dyd ordeyne that no man shulde touche yt. but of the remanant, men might take that, that shulde be nedefull for the feate of warre. And they did defende vpon payne of lyfe, that no man shulde propone nor put into deliberation to take of the sayd thousande talentes, except it were of necessitie, for to resiste the ennemys, in case that they came to assayle the cytie by sea. With that same monney, they made an houndred galleys besyde the ordynary, ryght fayer and gorgyouse. And euery yeare they therunto appoynted newe patrones and Capytaynes. Whiche galleys might not be employed to any other vse, but, in ye case aboue said, men might take of the said somme of a thousande talentes. As touchinge those that were departed in the o
                     •
                  here houndred shippes againste the countrey of Peloponese, they ioyned themselues with fifty other shippes, that the Corcyryens had sente them for succoure, and altogether compassinge aboutes the sayde countrey, besides many greate hurtes that they there dyd, they landed and came to assiege the cytie of
Metoune,Methona. whyche ys in the countrey of Laconie. whiche was than yll repayred with walles, & vnprouyded

of people. But by fortune, Brasidas, sonne of Telydas Spartayne, was in the same quarter, very nighe vnto yt, with a smal nomber of men of warre. Who vnderstandinge the comynge of the ennemys, came with a houndred armed men, onely, for to succour the towne, and passed through the myddes of the campe of the ennemys, that were dispersed & skatered abroade, And they made to ye walle so diligently and manfully, that with a very small losse of his people, that were slayne in passinge through, he entred into the towne, and saued yt. By reasone of whyche hardynes, he was praised by the Spartaynes aboue all those, that were in that same warre. At departure fromthens, the Athenyans wente to lande in the coutrey of Elede, wherin they toke the towne of Phee, where they soiourned two daies, pillaging al that coūtrey, and also they defeated and discomsited thre houndred good men of the valleys of the said countrey of Elyde, with a certaine other nōbre of the coūtrey adioining yt were come downe for to succour the said towne of Phee. And afterwards, a great wynde & tēpest arising in ye sea, by meane wherof, thair shippes might no longar tary there, for that, that it was a place wt out porte: one part of thē embarqued thēself. And passing bifore a rokky place, called Ithis, they came to aborde in the porte of Philie. To which place, the Messenyens & the other, that could not be embarqued at departure frome Phee, were come by lande, and had taken the towne by force. Whiche vnderstandinge, that there were nowe assembled a great bende of people of the countre of Elyde, for to come to ouerronne thē, habandoned the cytie & embarqued themselues with the other, & departed altogither keping that same sea, enuirōninge the places, nighe about it. In the same self tyme, the Athenyans sente thirty othere shippes for to go against ye quarter of Locride, & for to kepe ye Island of Eubee, & they cōmitted the cōducte of the same shipps vnto Cleopōpus,Cleopō
                     pus. son of Clynias, who, being there landed, wasted many coūtreis along by ye sea, & toke the towne of Thronie,Thronium. & caused the same to delyuer hostages. Afterwardes, certaine Locryās being come to repulse & chase him away, as he was bifore Alope,Alopa. he defeated & ouercame thē in battaile. In that same sōmer, ye Athenyans chased all the inhabitantes out of Egyne, wt thair wiues & childrē, reproching thē, that they were cause of all ye warre. And also they thought yt much more sure to inhabytt wt their people that same cytie, which was affectioned to the Peloponesyās. which thing they did anone after. But the Peloponesiās, aswel for hate of the Athenyās, as also for yt, that the Egynes had done thē many plaisirs, both in ye tyme, whā the earthquake was in thair coūtrey, & also in ye warre that they had against the Sklaues, they gaue thē the cytie of Thyree for their habytaciō,Thyrea wt all the terrytory thereof vnto the sea, for to labour. which terrytory departeth the coūtrey of Argiues, from that same of Laconie. And one parte of ye sayd Egynes, did inhabitt thēself ther, & the other wēt dispa

                  sed through the coūtrey of Grece. In ye self same sōmer, the furst day of the moneth in the chaūge of the mone, at which might only chaūse the eclips, As it was bileued: the sunne was darkened about noone or mydday. In such sort, yt there was sene many starres in heauē, & anone after came againe to his clerenes. At which time, ye Atheniās made appoinctmēt wt Nymphodorus Abderite,Nymphodores. who was bifore thair ennemy, for that, that he had greate authoritie with Sitalces,Sitalces. sonne of Thereus kinge of Thrace,Thereus. whoe hadde espoused his suster hopinge by his meane, to withdrawe the sayde Sitalces vnto thaire allyaunce. For that same Thereus hadde furst in his lyuinge made the royalme of Odrises, whiche he enioyed, most great of all the coūtrey of Thrace, whiche lyueth, in cōparison of the reste, in lybertie. This same Thereus was not he, that hadde Progne doughter of Pandion,Progne Pandiō
                   kinge of Athenes to wyfe, but they ruled in dyuers countrees of Thrace, for he, ye espoused Progne, holdeth ye coūtrey of Daulie,Daulia. which is

nowe called the lande of Phocyde, that was than inhabyted with Thracyens, in whose time, that same Progne and Philomene her suster dyd that greuous offence,Philomena. in the place of Itys.Itys. By reasone wherof many poetes makinge mention of Philomene, whiche is called the nightingale, named yt the byrde of Daulie. And it is good, to beleue that Pandyon, kinge of Athenes, made that allyance with the same Thereus king, that helde the countrey of Daulie, for that, that it was very nighe to Athenes for to haue succour & seruyce, rather, than wyth the othere Thereus, that helde ye coūtrey of Odrises, which was greatly distant fromthēce. That same than, of whome we speake, beinge a man of none estymation nor renōme, gott the roiaulme of Odrises, and lefte yt vnto Sitalces his sonne, with whome the Athenyans made allyance, aswell for to haue places, frendes and fauourers in Thrace, as also to destroye by hys meane, Perdycas kynge of Macedonie.Perdiccas. And Nymphodorus came vnto Athenes with full power of the sayd Sitalces, to conclude thappoinctmente, whiche thinge he didde. And moreouer he caused his sonne, named Sadocus,Sadocus. to be made Citezeine of Athenes. And he toke charge to practise with Sitalces that he shulde cease & forbeare the warre, that he made in Thrace, for to sende to the Athenyans horsmen and footemen lightly armed, all Thracyens. He moreouer made appoinctement bitwene the Athenyans and Perdicas by meane of the cytie of Therme,Therma. whiche they rendered him at perswation of the same Nephodorus. By meane of whiche appoynctment, Perdicas ioynned with Thathenyans and with Phormeon, biganne warre against them of Chalcyde.Chalcidienses. In this manner the Athenians had Sitalces kinge of Thracyans and Perdicas kinge of Macedonyans in thair allyance. And durynge this tyme, their people that were gone into Peloponese with the hoūdred furst shippes, toke the towne of Solyon,Solyō. bilonginge to the Corynthyans. And after that they hadde vtterly pillaged yt, they gaue it with all the territory vnto them of Palere,Palirē
                     ses. whyche be in the countrey of Acharnanie. And after that, they toke the towne of Astacte by force, whiche they reduced to theire allyaunce, hauynge chased frome thence Euarchus,Euarchus. that helde yt by tyranny. And this done, they toke saile for to come to the Isle of Chephalanie,Cephalenia. which was situated for anēpste the countreis of Acharnanie, and of Lewcade, and there were four cyties, to wit, Pale,Pales Cranie,Cranii Samee,Sauius. and Pronnee.Pronneus. So without any resistence they toke al the Isle. And sone after departed frōthence about the ende of somer for to retourne to Athenes. But they, beinge arryued at Egyne, vnderstode howe Pericles was come fourth with a great bende of men of Athenes, and was entred into the territory of Megare. So they toke their way for to retyre straight into that partie, & there landed, and ioygned themselfe with the other. Which was one of the greatest assembles of men of warre, that had bene yet sene togither, of Athenyans alonely. For also the cytie was than in his flower, and hadde not suffred any calamitie. And it is sayde that they were ten thousand men armed all of Athens, besides thre thousand that were at Potyde, and the inhabytātes of the feldes, that were retyred into the cytie, which were issued with thē to the nōber of thre thousand all well armed. And beside those, there was a great nōber of othere lightly armed, whyche altogether hauinge pillaged and wasted the more parte of the territory of Megare, retourned fromthence vnto Athens. And the same Athenyans ceased not yearely to come to ouerronne the sayde countrey of Megare. Sō
                  tyme wyth horsemen, and sometyme with fotemen, vntill that they toke the cytie of Nysee. But that furste yeare whereof we speake, they fortefyed wyth walles the cytie of Atalēte.Atalāta And neuerthelas whā it came vnto the ende of ye somer they habandōned & destroyed yt. For that, that yt was nighe the Locryans & the

Opuntyens, to the intent that the Corsairyens shulde not haue the commodyte to wythdrawe themselfe thider, for to come to ouerronne the coūtrey of Eubee. All the whyche thinges were done that selfe same sommer, chiefly, after that the Peloponesians were departed from the lande of Athens. At begynnyng of winter, Euarchus Acarnanyan, myndinge to retourne into the cytie of Astacte, required the Corinthians to delyuer hym fifty shippes, and a thousande fyue hoū
                  dredde men armed. By whose ayde, togither with some that he shulde finde on hys syde, he mighte recouer the sayde cytie. whiche thinge they did. And committed the charge of the said armye to Euphamydes,Euphamydas sonne of Aristomynus to Tymoxenus,Timoxenus. sonne of Tymocrates, and to Eumachus,Eumachus. sonne of Chrisis. who beinge come by sea to the sayd cytie, sett the same Euarchus within yt. And parforced and aduaunced themselfe in that voyage, to subdue certayne townes of Acharnanie, whiche were alongest the sea. But parceyuynge that they coulde not do yt, they retourned fromthence, & passinge by, bifore the Isle, they landed nigh to the cytie of Cranye, thinking to take yt by composition. But they of the towne fayninge to intreate with them, came to assayle them, beinge vnprouyded, and dyd slay one parte of them, and the other were constrayned to retyre into theire barques, and to retourne into thair countrey. That selfe same wynter, the Athenyans,The forme of ye generall & publique exequies in Athenes followynge the auncyent vsage of the cytie, made thair publique or opēne obiites or obsequies for them, that were deade in that same warre. And they were made in this manner. Thre dayes bifore, there was made a greate tabernacle, within the whiche, was putt the boones of them, that were dead, and their parentes & frendes might laye vpon thē, what they thought good. Afterwards, euery lignage of the towne or trybe, had a great coffer of Cypres. Into whiche they did putt the boanes of them, that were dead of that trybe, and they dyd cary that same cofer vpō a charrett. And after all the cofres, was caryed vpon an other charrett, a great bedde ready made, beinge hooly voyde, whyche represented them that were dead, whose bodyes coulde not be founde. And the sayd Charyottes were cōducted and accōpanyd by all sortes of people, Citezeins or other, (those, that wold cōme) vntill the sepulcre, wherat were the wyues and parentes of the deade, makinge greate weapinges and Lamentacyons. And afterwardes they dyd putt all the sayde cofres in a publique graue or monument made for that purpose in the fayrest suburbe of the cytie, ye same sepulcre or graue is called Ceramicō, wherin was accustomed to be buryed all they, that were dead in thair warres, reserued thē, that were slayn in Marathone. To whō, for remēbrance of their singuler vertue, they wylled to make a particuler sepulcre vpō the self place. And after that the corpses were buryedde, the custome was, that some notable personage of the cytie, a man of knowlaige and honnorable, according to the qualitie of the deade, shulde make bifore the people a preachinge or declaration in thair prayse. And afterwardes, euery man departed. In this manner, the Athenyans buryed them, that dyed in theire warres, so often, as the chaunce happened. And that tyme, Pericles sonne of Xantippus, was deputed and chosen for to reherce and propone the prayse of them, that were the furst slayne in that warre. Who, after the solempnyte of the sepulture of buryall acheued and ended, mounted or stode vp in a highe chaire, in manner, that all the people might vnderstande hym well, and dyd speake in this manner.
            
            
               
               ¶ The funerall declaration of Pericles. ☞The .vii. Chapter.
               MAny of them, that haue herebifore declared in this place, greatly haue praysed this custome to reasonne and speake bifore all the people in the praise of them, that were dead. But it semeth to me, to be ynough, to declare by deedes, the honnours and the prayses of theym, that by high actes haue meryted them, as youe haue sene, that hathe bene done in this present solempnyte of publique funeralls. And that men shulde not commyt to the discretion of one only man, the vertues and prayse of so many valyant people, nother yet bileue that, whiche he therin sayde, were yt good or euyll. For it is a thinge very harde and difficile, to kepe the meane and reasone in speakinge of suche thinges, wherof skarcely may be hadde a certayn opynyon, of the trouthe. For if that he, that heareth it spokē, hath knowlaige of the dede, and loueth him, of whome is spokenne, he thinketh alwayes that there is lesse spoken, than ought to be. And that he willed not. And by the coūtrary, vnto him, that hath no knowlaige, it semeth for enuie that he hath, that all that, whiche is spoken of an other more further, than his oune strengthe, and vertue can atteigne to, ys withoute trouthe. For that, that euery man thinketh that none shulde prayse nor esteme an other more, than himselfe, and if a man passe further, he is enuied and in nothinge bileued. But sithens it hath bene approued and allowed of a longe tyme, that it ought to be this done, it becommeth me, obeynge to the lawe, to accommodate & apply my speking to the opynyō & wille of euery one of you, the most y• I maye, begynnyng to prayse our auncesters and progenitours, for that, that it is a thinge raisonnable and honneste to render in this place, this honnour, for the memory and recordation of them, that furst inhabited and peopled this region. And from hande to hande, by thair vertue, haue lefte & delyuered yt, vnto thaire discent, franke and free, vntill this present daye. And if they herefore be worthy of prayse, our fathers whiche came after, be yet more worthy, who aboue that, that thair auncyentes hadde lefte vnto them, haue acquyred and added, by thaire labours and vertues, all the empire and seignyory, that we presently do holde. And yet, aboue them, there in we that be lyuynge, specyally in competente aage, haue incresed and amplefyed it, and also haue prouyded and fournished our cytie with all thinges, that be necessary aswell for peace, as also for warre. And yet I intende not to reherce the great prowesse and valyauntnes, that we and our ancesters haue vsed, in defending vs, aswell agaynst the straungers, as againste the Grekes that haue warred vpon vs. By meanes wherof, we haue acquired & gottonne all our landes and lordeshipps, For I wil not be prolixe in those thinges, whiche youe do all knowe. But after that I shall haue declayred, by what witt, by what industry and laboure, and by what arte, our empyre hath bene establisshed and augmented, I wyll come to the prayse of thē heare, of whome, we haue to speke. For that, that it semeth to me, not to be without purpose, to remember at this presente, thies thinges, and that yt shall not be vnprofytable to all them, that be here present, be they originall cytezeins or inhabitantes. For we haue the rule of a publique weale, whiche folowith not the lawes of cyties nighe vnto it, but we geue rather lawe and exemple vnto other, the whiche we followe not. Also our gouernment ys called Democrotie, whiche ys not conueniēt for a fewe people, but for many. By reasonne wherof, euery of vs, of what qualitie that he be,

(prouyded that he haue some qualitie of vertue) hathe asmuche righte to come to honnors of the cytie, as the other. And it is not regarded of what house, nother of what parte of Citezeins, he is, but onely what vertue he hath. for what poore man it may be, or of what rase or distente, howe vyle or vnknowen that it be, so that he maye proffytte the common wealthe, he is not impesched to haue charge and publique office. We procede furthermore, franquely and symply to the feates of the comon wealthe, and to thaffayres and ymagynations, that we haue euery daye wyth oure neyghbours withoute mouinge ourselfe, or beinge angry, if any of them reioyse of any violence, that they haue done vs. And there as they reioyse, we kepe an irreprehensible seueritie, dissimulinge oure heuynes. And neuerthelas we ioyefully comunycate our particuler goodes. And touchinge them, that appertaigne to the comon wealthe, we do not mysuse them, aswell for feare of the officers, as of the lawes. And chiefly of thē, that be made or arne to make, to helpe them, that haue bene deceyued, whyche bringe a manyfeste infamye v
                     •
                  to them that deceyue. Of the other parte we haue many things for to refreshe and recreate the sprittes, that be trauailed by labours, to wytt, the playes and holly exercises, and the yearely sacrifices, whiche be made with an honest and plaisant apparaile, through delectation wherof, 
                     •
                  he heuynes and malencoly of the people ys abolished and lessened. Furthermore men do bringe hither for the greatenes of the cytie, from all landes and countreys, all soortes of thinges, so that we vse not, more of the goodes that increas and growe in our land, than of them, that be growen in other countreys. And as touching the mylitary or warly excercises, that be done in the cytie, we be different from our ennemys. Forsomuche as we make and suffer our cytie comon to all people. And forbydde not any persone, be he cytezeine or straunger, to take yt or to biholde that, which he thinketh good. For our thinges be not hyd or kept secrett, though that they might proffitt the ennemys, whan they see them. Also we haue not somuch affyance in our apparaile for warre, nor in our subtelties a
                     •
                  d cawtels, as in the highnes of our hartes, which we may alwayes shewe in all affaires. And though that we lyue more at our ease, than many other, which frō beginning of their yougth excercise themselfe in learninges incessantly vntill they be made men, yet we be not for that, lesse hardy and ready for to experymente all daungers, whan it is nedefull. And that may wel be knowin by thys, that the Lacedemonyans alone, durst not enter into our land without they were accōpaignied wt all their allyes. And yet we, wythoute ayde of other, be entred into the lande of our neighbours, and also haue right often, without great difficultie subdewed them, that defended themselfe very well in thair howses. And yet neuer none of the ennemys durste aduenture themself to resiste oure foorce, whan we haue bene altogiders. Aswell for the experyence and exercise, that we haue in the sea, as for the men of warre that we holde in dyuers places. And if our ennemys haue any tyme the victory againste any bende of our people in one of the sayd countreis, they auaunte them selfe that they haue vainquished vs all. And lykewyse if they be defeated by any of the said bēdes, they say y•, that was done by vs all. And in infect, we loue more reste, whan we be not constrayned by any necessitie vnto trauaile: than to be, in contynuall labours. And to exercise vs in good manners and comon wealthes, rather than to lyue alwayes in feare of lawes. For also it is beste, not to serche the myseries and myschaunces, vntill that they happenne, and whan it is tyme to enter therin, to shewe, that we go therunto, as bolde, as those, that be always in the busynes. Yet may this cytie be had in admyration, in one thinge, aswell as in all the other, that is, that we vse with our allyes, an honneste & meane socyetie

and fellishypp. And on the othere parte, we play the Philosopher, that is to saye, that we indure pouertie, without losinge the harte to gett goodes: and vse riches, more for the commodyte, whan it is tyme: than for Pompe and for glory. And there is noone, that holdeth it for shame, to confesse his pouertie, but wel rather, not to parforce himselfe, for to exchue it. Further, there is none, that hath not care aswell for the comon affaires, as for his owne particuler. In suche manner, that those, which be occupyed in their pryuate busynes, haue not therfore lesse knowlaige of the estate of the comon wealthe. For we haue that for synguler, that he, whyche hath no knowlaige of the comon wealthe, we repute him not onely to be slouthful and necligent, but also we take him not, for a cytezein. we also alone, iudge the causes, whan we conceyue them, accordinge to reasone. For we repute nor thinke that raysoning and declarynge, noyeth or is hurtfull in causes, but rather that it hurteth, not to learne & to be infourmed by sage sentences and declarations of the manner, that they shuld be done, bifore they be executed. And ther of it cometh, that we vse in all thinges that we haue to do, more of audacyte and hardynes and of reasonne, than any other. For the other sometyme haue through ignorance, more confydence, than reasone willeth, and sometyme for to gronude themselfe tomuch in reasons, be slacke to execute their affaires. And yet, he ought to be reputed to haue reasonable and vertuous iudgemēt, that knowith redely and clerely, the harde and noysome thinges, aswell as the pleasaunt. And by this meane, not to withdrawe himself from daungers, whan they happen. we vse furthermore the offices of vertue, by contrary reasone and manner, that the othere people do. For that, that we attempte and goo aboute to gette frendes, more by doinge them some pla
                     •
                  sire and benefytt, than in receyuinge it, of them. Also in kepinge the amytie and benyuolence, he that receyueth the plaisir and benefytt, is in worse condition, than he that doth it. For, for him that doth it, it is ynough to conserue it by benyuolence. But he that hath receyued it, vnderstandeth this that in rendringe the like, he gratefieth not, but rather dothe render the plaisir, whyche he hath receyued. Also we alone do gratefie nobly and liberally our frendes, more for to proffitt them, than for to shewe, that we vse our liberalitie towardes them. And for to speake all at one woorde, I thinke that this cytie, is the myrroure and the doctryne of all Grece, and one body mete and suffycient to be made mynistre of hys membres and suppostes in all manner of thynges wyth good grace and honneste. All the whyche thynges be not shewed and verefyed by wordes nor by declaratiōs: but by the apparance of the trouth, as may be sene & knowin by the puissāce of this cytie, which hath bene established by this meane in suche reputacion, as it is sene by experyence, that this same our cytie is renōmed through all the world, more thā any other. And it is that cytie alone, that geueth not occasion to hys propre ennemys, to runne vpon it for to hate it, though that they receyued thereby shame and damage, cōsideringe of what people they receyued it: nothere is it blamed of his subiects, as vnworthy to gouerne. And also it cannot be sayd, that, that our puyssance sheweth not itself but by tokens and signes, for there be sene so greate experiences, that bothe those that be present, & also those that shall come after, shal hold them for myracles. And we nede not to couett to haue an Homere, nor other poete of thē y• be lyuinge, for to exaulte or extol
                     •
                  e our feates by poetical coulours: for ye trouth of thinges e
                     •
                  faceth & blotteth out the opynion therof, for that, that we haue by our audacyte & magnanimytie or noblenes of mind, made all the lande, & all the sea passable, leuinge euery wher, a memorial of ye goodnes or of the euils, that we haue there seperatly done. Now for this cytie than, thies, whose exequies we celebrate, died in fighting

vertuously, for that, that they thought it a thinge tomuche harde to be depryued from it. whiche opynyon and wyll, we other, that be suruyuing, ought alwayes to haue. Whiche hath bene cause, wherfore I haue more prolixe and largely spoken of thys cytie, aswell to shewe, that we fyght not for a thinge like vnto othere, but for that same, vnto whome none othere is like: as also to thintent that the praisinges of them, of whome we speake, shulde be more manifested and opened. Of whiche thinges, we haue nowe sayde the pryncipal parte. For the prays of the excellency, and of the greatnes of this cytie, wherof I haue bifore spokenne, ys dewe vnto them here and vnto thair like. whiche thinge, very fewe of the other people of Grece may reasonably say, of thair feates. And I thinke that the chiefest iudge of vertue in a man, is the vertuous lyfe: and the last confirmator, is the honnorable deathe, as that same of thies here hath bene. For it is a thing iuste and reasonable, that they, that cannot do othere ayde nor othere seruice to the common wealthe: that they shewe themsel
                     •
                   couragions to defende yt in feate of warre. For that, that this doinge, they acquyte themselues right well in suche comon affaire towardes the cytie, where they had euill acquited bifore tyme, by attendynge to thair particuler busynes. And by this meane recōpense that same fault, by this seruice. And there hath not bene he, of thies here, that withdrewe himself or retyred for his goodes or ryches, desiringe more the enioyinge therof for the tyme to come, than the goodnes of the partie, nor also, y• spared himself frō dangers for pouertie, hopinge to become ryche: but rather semed, that they had lesser care for theire welth, than for the same, of their ennemyes. And in effect, they were willing, in auenging themselues of ennemys, to come to this, wherunto they be come. For that, that yt was the most fayer experyence that they coulde make of thair vertue, in hope, to acquire and gett the glory, whiche they had neuer sene. For the which, it semed to them, by that, yt they had sene of other, that they ought well to aduenture their lyues. And that yt were better to indure death, in defendinge themselues valyātly, than to eskape by recuilling or drawing backe. wher vpon not for to incurre this dishonnour & this shame, they haue suffred in theire bodyes, and in a right small space of tyme, haue for a right greate glory, willed rather to indure fortune, than to obey vnto feare. In whiche doinge, they haue shewed themselues towardes the partie, to be suche, as they ought to be. And as touchinge the other that be suruiuinge, they ought well to couett to haue their intente sett lesse vnto daunger, but not to haue lesse of harte, for to resiste the ennemys. And consyder, that the proffitt and the vtilitie cōsisteth not onely somuch in that as I haue shewed youe: for there be many amonge youe that vnderstande & knowe yt, which may more amply expounde & declare what goodnes foloweth by repoulsing of ennemys. But it consisteth more, and youe shall knowe it better, if that biholding always the greatnes of ye cytie, by his workes, ye take daily more and more loue in it. And somuch that it shall seme more greate vnto youe, ye maye thinke, that there haue bene noble people. who, knowinge reason and honestie, haue gottone by thair vertuous workes all thies thinges. And whansoeuer that the affaires came otherwyse, thā they desired, they were not mynded to defraude the cytie of thair vertue, but rather they haue offred and geuen vnto it, the fayrest trybute or stipēde that they might pay, that is to wyt, their bodies. wherby they haue particulerly acquired for thēselfe eternall glory, and also right honorable buryall, not onely to be therein ingraued: but that theire vertue and their glory, bee in the same celebrated and magnefyed for euermore, whan tyme shall require to speake of thair feates, or for to ymitate and followe them. For to men illustrious, and renōmed, euery lande ys the sepulcre or graue. The memory

of whome, is not consarued by the Epitaphies and wrytinges of their domesticall sepulcres. But by the renomme that is yssued and dyuulged in strange nations. who consydered in thair vnderstanding more ye greatenes and highnes of thair couraige, than that, whych ys chaunced vnto thē. Such people we haue here lordes, brought fourth, that be worthy to be ymitated & followed, to thintent, that knowinge, ye felecytie ys lybertie, & that lybertie is gentlenes, you shuld not forsake the daungers of warre, & that the vnhappy & myserable, that haue no hope of goodnes, shulde not be reputed to do more wysely, to countergarde or safe thair lyue, than they, that be of an other condition, that is better, whyche put it in hazarte. For truly, cowardenes accompaigned wyth shame, is to a noble and gentle harte, more greuous ad displeasante, than death. whyche maketh vs without feling and insensible, chaūsing by his prowesse with hope of the comon glory. Considerynge the whyche thynges, youe other, that were fathers of them that be deade, oughte rathere to comforte youreselues and to reioyse, than to bewayle them. For if youe regarded the dyuers daungers of deathe, whereunto the infantes be subiectes, so longe as they be nourished: those arne mooste happy, vnto whome the more honnorable happenethe, as thies here haue bene. And youe likewyse coulde not mourne more gloryous, thoughe that I knowe very well, that it is ryght harde to perswade youe, that youe shulde not feele the heuynes and dysplaisir, always, as youe shall remember them, by the prosperytie that youe shall see of othere, of whome, in tymes paste, ye reioysed in lyke case. And whan youe shall consyder, that they be depryued, not onely frome hope of goodes, whyche they shuld paraduenture neuer haue enioyed, but of those same, that they had longe enioyed, youe must alwayes patientely indure yt. And comforte youreselfe

                   wyth hope that youe haue, to haue more chyldrenne, youe that are in age for to haue them. For that, that by the more chy

                  drene, that they shal haue hereafter, youe shalbe caused to forgette the mournynge of them here that be deade. and shalle sarue the commone wealthe in twoo manners, that ys, that they shall not leaue yt desolate, and also shall kepe yt in suertie. For somuch as they, that putte fourthe theire chyldrenne to daungers for the common wealth, (as those haue done that haue lost thairs in this warre) maye geue better counsaylle and more raysonnable, than they that haue not done yt. And as touchinge the othere amonge youe, that be so aged, that they haue no more hope to haue chyldrenne, somuche the more they oughte to be contente and to comforte themselfe to haue had this aduauntaige aboue the othere, as to haue lyued so longe in prosperitie, and that they shal passe the remenant of thaire lyfe (whych could not be longe) yet more swetely, for the glory of them here. For the desyre of honnoure ys the onely thynge, that bryngethe not age. And as some saye, there ys nothynge that the people desyre somuche in thair age, as to be honnored. Concerninge them amonge youe that be childrene, and brotherne of them, that be here deade, I see youe to be conuyued vnto a tourney, whiche ys ryghte harde. For there is no man, that praisethe not with woordes, the vertue of theym that be deade. In soorte, that youe that remayne, for any valyauntnes that ys in youe, shalbe skarcely iudged egall vnto theym, but rathere shalbe iudged to be inferyours, for that, that amonge the lyuynge, there be alwayes enmytyes.

That ys that youe oughte to holde for great glorye nott to be more frayle, than the successe importeth, nothere suche

as men ought opēly to make one onely mētyō of your vertue or of your blame. Now haue I in this my preaching & oratiō, that hath bene enioyned me, by vertue and authoryte of our lawes, sayde & rehersed, all the things, that haue semed to me to be vtile & profitable. And they yt haue bene here buryed, haue bene honored with dede, more than with wordes. whose children, the cytie shal nourish, if they be yonge and within the age of pubertie or orphancie: for to geue and set fourth a prays and a profytable rewarde, both to them, whych be dead, for thair faithful seruice: & also to other, yt shall herafter dye for like quarel. For euery man forceth hymselfe willingly and with good harte, to acquyre that, that is ordonned and iudged by comon decree, as a suffycient remuneratiō and rewarde of the vertue. It resteth, sithens that euery one of youe hath suffyciently bewayled and honnored in mournynge his neighbours, parentes, allyes and frendes: that youe retire and withdrawe youe all into your houses. In this manner and solempnitie, the exequies and funeralls were celebrated at Athens, the winter, whiche was the ende of the furst yeare of the warre.

               THe sommer folowinge, the Peloponesyans and thair allyes entred agayne into the lande of Athenes by two partes, so as they had done ye sommer preceding, vnder the conduct of Archidamus king of Lacedemonyens. And hauinge planted thair campe, pillaiged and wasted all the coūtrey. And an one after that they were therin entred, ther soubdainely came vpon the Athenyans a pestilence, which furst had bene (as men saye) in the cytie of Lemne & in many other places. But there was neuer sene in place of ye world, so greate contagyousnes, nor wherof, so many people dyed. And the phisicyans could not therin ministre remedy, nother from the begynnynge knewe nothinge therin, so that many among thē therof dyed, chiefly those, that went to visitt the sicke. Also in lyke manner, men founde no remedy by vowes, by diuinations nor by any suche meanes, as they vsed. For in effecte all did nothing sarue or auaile. By meane whereof, whan the people were attaincted or infected, they lefte al the said remedies. And the same pestilence biganne, as it is sayde, in the countrey of Ethiope, that is aboue Egypte. Afterwardes it descēded into Egipt & into Libie, and extended yt self greatly, into the landes & seignyories of the kyng of Persie. And from thence, yt came incontynently to Athenes and biganne in Pyrens By meane wherof, they of the towne thought at begynnynge, that the Peloponesiās had impoysonned thair countrey for that, that they yet had not any fountaynes. Sone after, it passed into the hedde cytie. Fromthens, it spred maruailously ouer all.

For I speake as hauinge knowlaige. insomuche as I my selfe

And withinfourthe, their tongue and their throte, became all redde, & their breath became stinkynge and harshe. Whereupon, there ensued a continual neysinge, and therof thair voice became hoerse. Anone after that, yt descended into the stomacke, whyche caused a greate coughe, that did righte sharpely payne them, and after that the matter came to the partes of the harte, it prouokedde them to a vomyte. By meane whereof, wyth a peyne yet more vehemente, they auoyded by the mouthe, stynkinge and bitter humors. And wyth that, some dyd fall into a yeskynge, whereupon they came incontynently into a palsey, whyche passed passed from some fourthwyth, and with othere endured longer. And althoughe, that, to touche and se them wythoute, and throughe the bodyes: they were not exceadinge hotte nor pale, but that thair skynne was, as redde colour adusted, full of a lytle thynne blaynes: yet they feeled wtinfourthe so maruailous a heate, that they might not indure, one onely clothe of lynnen vpon their fleshe, but they must of necessytie be all bare. And the greates

                  e plaisir that they coulde haue, was to caste them within a very colde caue, so that many of thē that were not kepte, casted themselfe wythin the pyttes, by force of the heate and of the droughe, though that it were all one to drynke lytle or much. With all this, they hadde no reste in all thair membres, by meanes wherof, they coulde neuer slepe. And yet though the euyll engendredde or waxed more, yet the bodyes were not thereby muche weakened, but they resisted the sickenes more than woulde haue bene thought, in suche manner, that some, that dyed of that great heate that burned thair entrailes, within seuen dayes and some wyth in nyne, they hadde yet some strengthe. And if they eskaped thys terme, the maladye yet descended to the belly, whyche caused a laxe wyth contynuall paynes, whereby manye died of weakenes. And for effecte, thys same pestylence and infectyon dydde gather togyther and engendred furst in ye hedde and afterwardes ouerronned through all the vpper and exteryoure partes of the bodye. The vehemencye and violence whereof, shewed ytselfe to them, that recoueredde, in the extreme parties of theire bodyes. For yt descended to the secrete membres and to the extremytes of the fete and of the handes, and in suche sorte, that some that were recouered thereof, loste them, the othere loste the eyes, some othere, whan the maladye lefte them, hadde loste knowlaige and memory of all thynges, and of themselues.

And aboue all othere beastes, the dogges gaue mooste knowlayge of thys infectyonne for that, that they mooste accustomedde to haunte the people. Butt for to leaue manye othere soortes of

calamytes and of myseries of that same pestelence that chaunced dyuersly to particulers, vnto some more sharply, than vnto othere, it cōprehended al othere maladies, and dyd not ronne into any other. wherof

It left neuerthelas the bodies in thair entiernes, without that ther might be parceiued any difference of strēgth nor debilitie.

But the woorste that was in this, was that men loste their harte, & hope incontynently, as they feeled themself attain

And an other great euill was, that the malady was so cōtagious, that those, that went for to visitt the sicke, were taken and infected, lyke as the shepe be, one after an other. By occasyon wherof, many dyed for lacke of succours. whereby it happened that many howses stoode voyde, and they that went to se theym, dyed also. And specially the most honnest & honorable people, whiche toke it for shame, not to go to se nor succour their parentes and their frendes. And loued better to putt and sett fourth themselfe to manyfest danger, than to faile them at thair necessitie. Yet fynally they forsoke all, and were ouercome by the vehemency of the pestelence. Seinge the multitude of them, that dyed, in wepinge and lamentinge. But aboue all, they that were eskaped, did se the partie and the myserye of othere, for y•, that they had experymēted yt in thēself. And also they were oute of daungers. For yt neuer toke them againe that had had it, at the least so, yt they were in doubte of lyfe. By meanes wherof, they were reputed to be righte happy. And they themselfe for the ioye that they had of thair present helthe: had a folishe and vayne presumption to eskape afterwardes, from all other sickenes. Besides this pestilence, the citezeins were molested & anoyed by the great quantyte and dyuersyte of grosse moueables, whyche those that were retyred into the cytie had brought thider. For that, that the lodginge beinge small and yet occupyed with suche moueables & necessaries, they knewe not, where to tourne them self, and specyally at that same tyme of sommer, and by this meane, they dyed, cowched, where as they might, wythout any honnestie, some tyme the one vpon the other. And many were sene half dead in the stretes (chiefly aboutes the fountaynes) which wallowed on the earth, for the desire that they had of water. And the same temples where they had holden theire lodginges and abydinge, were full of dead corpses. For through the violence of the sickenes, they knewe not what they dydde, and hadde loste the knowlaige and reuerence of religion of the hollynes of places. And the righte of the graues, whiche they vsed in tyme paste, were all troubled and cōfused. For euery man buryed his, there, as he might. So that many housholdes, there graues beinge filled by the multitude of them, that were deade of their lignaige & familye, were constrayned, to caste the bodies of the other that dyed, into fylthy and dishonnest graues. For some, seing a butcher to be prepared & ready to burne some other body, casted ye same of thair parētes aboue, & did put fyer vnder. The other did caste it nowe after that the fyer was there made, and the other bodye aboue, that burned. And after departed. And besides all the euills & dommaiges, that this pestilēce caused, by occasyon therof, bigōne one euille custome in our cytie, which afterwards extēded vnto many other things, more great. For that, that men had presently thā no shame to do things openly, whiche in tymes paste were wylled not to be done in secret. By this, that

they were kepte and restrayned from wantonnes & voluptuousnes. For seinge than one so greate and so soubdayne mutation and change of fortune, and that they that dyed soubdaynely, were verye happy, in regarde of them, that lauguyshed, and were longe in payne: The poore people to whome the goodes or ryches came, cared not, but for to spende it shortely in all thynges of pleasure and voluptuousnes, and they thought that they could not do better. hauing no hope to enioye it longe, but rather attendynge and lokyng to leue them shortly, togeders wyth theyr lyfe. And there was none, that for honnestye (though he knewe and vnderstode it) that wolde regarde to be wyllynge to enterpryse any honeste thynge, wherin there was any care or trauayle, hauynge no hope that he shulde lyue so longe, as to see it acheued and fynyshed. But all that, which for the time, they founde playsant and delectable for mans appetyte, they reputed profytable and honneste, wythoute any feare of Goddes or of lawes. For that, that they thought it to be all one to do yll, or good, consydered y• aswell dyed the good, as the euyll, and also they hoped not to lyue so longe, that punyshment might be taken on them for their mysdedes by iustice, but they wayted a greater punishment by the sentence of Goddes, which was nowe geuen, to wytt, to dye of that same pestilence. Whervpon, sythens it was so, they thought that it was beste, to employ the small tyme that they had to lyue, in makyng good chere and at their pleasure. In this calamyte than were the Athenyans, that dyed within the citye of the same pestylence, and withoute, the enemyes put all to fyer and bloude. Herevpon they brought many pronostications vnto theyr memory and also aū
                  sweres of the Goddes, that had bene made before. Whiche they adapted and cō
                  pared vnto thys chaunce. But amonge other a verse, that the auncyentes sayde, to haue harde song in theyr yougth, which had bene pronounced by an aunswer or oracle of the goddes in thys substaunce. There shall cōme into Dorye, warre wyth the lymon, wherof was altercation, before that thys chaunce happened. For some sayde, that by thys worde lymon, famyne shulde be vnderstanded, the other sayde, that it wolde signifye pestylence, but after that the chaunce was chaunced of the pestylence, euery one applyed the worde of the oracle vnto that, And in my fantasye, yf there yet came any other warre in the countreye of Dorye wyth famyne, men wolde applye it, aswell to the same there, as they dyd vnto thys here. They set fourth lykewyse the aunswere, that had bene made by the oracle of Apollo to the interrogacyon of the Lacedemonyans, touchyng that same warre. For hauynge demaunded who shulde haue therin the victory, the aū
                  swere of the God had bene, that those that shulde make the warre with all their strengthe, and that he wolde be theyr ayde. And vpon that same aunswere, they made lykewyse theyr iudgementes and interpretations. For that same pestilence beganne fourthwith, as the Peloponesyans were entred that same yeare, into the lande of Athenyans. And also it dyd no euyll to the sayde Peloponesyans, at the leaste, whereby it shulde be caused to be estemed. And furst it toke in the citie of Athens, and after spredde to other townes of the countreye, as the same were peopled. And this is as touchynge the thynges that happened by the saide pestilence.

ennemys. But after that they were entred into the lande of Athenes, he caused to prepare a houndred shyppes for to pillage and waste lykewyse in theyr coū

Into which he caused to be putt foure thousande footemen, and vpon other shyppes for to cary horses, he caused to be set thre houndred warryours horsemen with theyr horses. which shyppes were than furst made at Athens of wood of olde shyppes, and in theyr compaignye wente those of Chio and of Lesbos wt fyfty other shyppes. And Pericles departed from Athens wyth the sayde armye by sea than, whan the Peloponesyans were in the region nyghe the sea of Athenes. So they came furst to descende into the lande of Epydaure, which is in Peloponese, the whiche they pyllaged ouerall, and assieged the cytye, in hope to take it. But seynge that they loste tyme, they departed from thence, and wente into ye regyons of Troizenide,Troezenis. of Halyde & Hermyonide, in the whiche, they dyd the like as they had done in that same of Epydaure. All whiche places be in the countrey of Peloponese on the sea coaste. From thence, they wente to descende in the countrey of Prasie, whiche is in the regyon, nyghe to the sea, in the countrey of Laconye. which countrey they pyllaged togedres with the towne, which they toke by force. And that done they retourned into theyr countrey of Athenes, frōwhence, the Peloponesyans were than departed for feare of the pestylēce, whiche had alwayes contynued in the cytye, and wythoute, ouer the Athenyās, so long, as they were in the sea, and that the Pelyponesyans were in theyr lande. Whervpō, those same Peloponesyans, vnderstandynge by the prysonners the infectyon & daunger of the same pestilence, and perceiuing also the burying of the deade, departed hastely from the sayd lande, after that they had taryed there, fourty dayes. Durynge whiche tyme, they wasted all the same countrey. In the same sommer, Agnon,Agnon

               THe anger and desplaysir that youe haue agaynste me at thys present, is not otherwise chaunced, thā I haue thought before. For I do well vnderstande the causes, whereof it proceadeth. And th
                     •
                  rfore I am well wyllyng to cause youe here to assemble, for to reduce some thinges to youre remembraunce, and also to complayne of youe, yf youe (wrongefully and wythoute cause be angry against me, or yf you do leese your hartes and courage in aduersites. And as concernyng myself, I esteme and iudge that the cytezeins be better in particuler, whan all the cytye is in good estate: than whan, all the citezeins particulerly be well, and the common welt he is lost. For that, that whan the common estate is destroyed, he that is well in hys particular, is no lesse destroyed, than the other. And by the contrary, yf he haue any euil in hys particularite, he saueth hymself with the common prosperite. And forsomuche (as whan it happeneth) that the publique welthe may suffer thaduersytes of particulers, but the particulers can not remedye them of the commonaltie: Is it not more reasonable al together to helpe it, than to habandone and leue it by faylynge of harte, and by impacyence in particular aduersites, lyke as youe presently do? And yf youe blame me, sayinge that I gaue you counsaylle to enter into thys warre: that doinge, youe blame lykewyse yourself, that haue followed my counsayle. Be not therfore angry agayne one, suche a man as I am. before whome in my conceite, youe ought not to preferre any other. Be it for to knowe that, which is nedefull, or for to execute it, nor also that hath more loue vnto the cytie, and that can be lesse corrupte wyth monney. All whiche thynges, be requisite for a good cytezeine. For he, that vnderstandeth thinges, and doth them not, that is asmuche, as yf he dyd not vnde

                   my Lordes, yf you, knowynge all these thynges to be meanely in my parsone, haue trusted in me before all other for thys warre: you blame me nowe wrongfullye. For as it is f

                  lly to desyre warre when men be in prosperytye: euen lykewyse, whan they be forced ayther to subiecte themselues incontinently to theyr neyghbours, or to do that, that they cōmaunde them, or ells to take the hazarte of warre for to kepe theyr lybertye, in hopynge the victory: they that in thys case, lose theyr courage & vertue, be muche more to be blaymedde. And as touchynge my self, I am alwayes of the opynyon, that I haue bene, and I wyll not change it. And though that you do wauer, yet it is full certayne, that at beginning ye were all of my aduyse. But sythens the euyls be come vpon you, ye do repent. And measuryng and iudging my reasone after your imbecillite and weakenes, ye fynde it nowe euyl. For that, that hytherto euery one hath feeled the troubles and incōmodites of ye warre, and that the common vtilite is not yet apparaunte. By occasyon whereof, youe arne so greately chaunged, for thynges of small importaunce, that youre harte nowe begynneth to shrinke and to fayle you. And youe haue not vertue and power, to indure the thyngs, that you haue determyned to indure. Also that chaū

commonly, that the thynges, which happen sodainly & vnthought on, do abate mens courage. Lyke as it hath chaunced vs in oure aduersities, & specially as touchyng the pestilence. And yet neuertheles, hauinge one so great & so noble citie, in the which we haue bene so well nourished and indoctryned, we oughte not to leese our couraige for incommodites that might happen, howe great soeuer they were, nother yet lose, our reputacion and renomme. For lyke as men do hate the man, that affecteth or purchaseth by ambition and presumption the honoure and glory that apperteygneth not vnto him: ryght so, they blame hym ye loseth the honnour and the glorye that he hadde. Wherfore Lordes we oughte, forgettynge the particuler dolours and passyons, to defende the generall lybertye. And notwythstandyng thys, that I haue oftentymes before declared vnto you, that they, whiche feare, that thys warre shulde be longe and daungerous, & that we shuld haue the woorse at the ende, be in errour: yet I woll gladly at this present declare vnto you a thynge, of the whiche, me thinketh, youe haue neuer thought, although yt you haue it.

It is that you thynke that youre empyre & seygniory, doth not extende it selfe, but ouer youre allyes. But I aduertyse youe, that of two partes of the lande and of the sea that be in the vse of men, youe haue fully the halfe in youre power. I meane, so farre as youe arne willyng to vse it. And yf you wolde enterpryse further, youe shulde haue it at youre pleasure. For there is not at thys daye kyng nor natyon vpon the earthe, that can empesche and let youre nauygatyon, into what parte youe woll, hauynge the armye by sea, suche as youe haue. Lykewyse knowing that youre puissance doth not shewe it self in the vsage of houses and of landes, whiche you make a great matter to haue lost, as though it were a greate thynge, it is not comely and sittinge for youe to take sorowe, for that they are marred, but iudgyng and reputyng, that it is but a small gardeyne ouertourned, and a small ornament of goodes loste (to the valewe of thys greate puyssance, wherof I do speake) to esteme it, nothynge at all. And furthermore to knowe, that by meane of youre lybertye, yf that youe holye and intierly kepe it, youe shall recouer easely, all these thynges. But yf that we cōme into seruitude & bōdage of other people, we shal both leese al yt, which we dyd holde in tymes past, and also we shall shew our selues, people of lesse harte, than oure fathers haue bene. who haue not had them of theyr auncestres, but haue gottonne and kepte them with theyr labours, and afterwardes, lefte them vnto vs. For it is muche greater shame to a man to suffre a thynge to be taken from hym, whiche he holdeth, than to fayle to gett that, whiche he coueteth. Wherefore, Lordes, it is mete for vs to go agaynste our ennemyes, not onelye in good hope and confydence: but also in despysynge them. For that, that the confydence, which cōmeth oftentymes by a prosperitie, vnthought on, more than by good prouydence, may chaunce vnto a man, that were not very wyse. But he, that by good raysone hath esperance & hope to vaynquish hys enemyes, lyke as youe haue, hath not onely confydence to do it, but more

                  uer he contempneth and despyseth theyme. And also whan that fortune and puyssance are egall, the dylygence and industrye that comme of a couragyous harte, maketh a man more assured in hys audacyte. For that, that he groundeth not hym self so much vpon hope of the vertue, whiche sheweth hymself in necessite,

as vpon the prouysyon and habundaunce of thynges that he sayth, by whiche, men knowe the better the prouydence. Also it is conuenyent for all wyth one accorde, to prouyde for the suertye of hys estate & seignyorye (which is very playsante to all) withoute refusynge of any labour or trauayle, excepte youe woll lykewyse refuse the honnours.

                  y do rule. For withoute any fayle, reste cannot geue suertye, yf it be not moderated and tempred by trauayle. And also it is not conuenyent for a cytye that wol rule and gouerne. Wherfore Lordes Athenyans, youe shulde not suffre youre selues to be seduced by suche manner of people, nother be angry agaynste me y• haue enterprysed the warre by youre consente. And though the armye of ennemyes hath done that, that was to be beleued that they wolde do to youe, not wyllynge to consente and obeye vnto them: and also thoughe thys pestylence is moreouer comme vpon you, whiche is the onely thynge that we least loked for, and for the whiche, I am the more hated by the moste parte of youe, truly it is a greate vnryght, that youe shulde wyll me euill. excepte, that at all tymes, whā any prosperyte shall happene, whiche youe shall not haue thought on, that you wolde like wyse attribute it vnto me. For of necessitie, those thynges must be endured, that chaunce by the wylle of Goddes: and those that come by ennemys, by vertue. And sence that it is the auncyent custome of thys cytye so to do, take hede, that it fayle not in youe, chiefly vnderstandyng that thys oure cytye hath a very great renōme amonge al people, for that, that it abassheth not at aduersites, but hath indured great labours and trauayles and losse of many good citezeins in warre. By meane wherof, it hath acquyred and conserued vntyll thys present day, this great puyssance and seignyory. Frome whiche, yf we nowe do haband

For that, that we be those amonge the other Grekes, that haue had greatest Empyre, and susteigned more of warres, not onlye agaynste thother in particuler, but also agaynst all them togethers, and that haue had the rychest and most peopled citie of al Grece. yet neuertheles I know that they, that be fearful and faynte harted, woll desprayse and blame thys, that I do saye. But they that haue good wylle and desyre to do vertuous thynges, shall fynde it good. And yf those, that shall not be capable and vnderstande my raysons and declarations, conceyue hate and enuye agaynste me, that shalbe no newe thynge. For that is alwayes happened to all them that arne reputed worthye to presyde, gouerne, and to commaunde other. But he that endureth suche enuye and euyll wylle in greate affayres, is that same that prouydeth wel therfore, and in contempnynge the hatred, acquyreth honnour and reputacyon

in tyme presente, and perpetual glory for tyme to comme. The which two thinges, to wytt, the present reputacyon and the glory to comme, haue wille, Lordes Athenyans, Ioyfullye to embrase, and not to sende any more, heraulte nor messenger towardes the enemys, nother to lose your courage for the present dā

               ¶ Of the vertues and laudable conditions of Pericles. ☞The tenth Chapter.
               BY suche talke and wordes, Pericles enforced hymself to appayse the anger of ye Athenyans, and to cause thē to forgett the euylls and dō
                  mages, that they had. And for effecte, they all in generall agrede vnto hym. In such sorte, that afterwardes they sente none Ambassadours towardes the Lacedemonyans, but desposed themselfe to the warre. Neuertheles in particuler, they were sore agreued to indure all the dyffycultyes. to wytt, the common people, for that, that the litle goodes whiche they had, was consumed by the warre: and the ryche and noble men, for that they had loste the fayre possessyons and the sumptuous houses, that they had in the feldes. And this was the most grief: that they had warre, in stede of peace. By reasone of whiche thynges, they remytted not the hatred that they had agaynste Pericles, but cō
                  dempned hym in a somme of monney. And neuertheles, wythin a smal tyme after (lyke as is the cvstome of the people to be varyable) dyd chose
                     •
                   hym agayne to be theyr Duke, and gaue hym full puissance and auctoryte in all thynges. For although that they were nowe weakened by the euyls and dammages that they had suffred in particuler: yet in thynges, that concerned the weale and gouernement of the common wealthe, they knewe that they had nede of hym, and that he was the most suffycyent man, that they had. Also for trouthe, so longe as he had the gouernaunce, durynge the peace, he admynystred moderately and defended it intierly, and also augmented and amplefyed it greately. And afterwardes, whan there was questyon of the warre, he knewe and vnderstoode ryghte well the strength and puissance of the cytye, lyke as it appereth by that, which therin hath be done. But sithens hys death, which was two yeares and a halfe after the warre begonne, men knowe muche more hys prudence and prouidence. For he had alwayes shewed them, that they shulde haue the victory of that warre, yf they kepte themselfe from fayghtynge agaynste the enemyes on lande, and dyd execute theyr feate by sea. wythout alwayes to searche to gette a newe seignyory, and wythoute puttynge the cytye in daunger. wherin, after hys deathe, they dyd the whole contrarye. And moreouer, touchynge the other thynges, that concerned not the warre: they, whiche had the administratyon, dyd euery one after hys ambition and particular couetice, bothe to the greate preiudyce of the common welthe, and also of themselfe. For theyr enterpryses were suche, that whan it thā came to theyr intente, it redounded to the honnoure and proffite of particulers, more than of the commone. But chaunsynge to the contrarye, it was the perdition and losse of the common welthe. And the cause of thys disorder, was for

that, that durynge the tyme, that the same Pericles was in auctoryte, he had the reputacyon, the myndes and affectyons, and assured fealtie and truste. Also with out all doubte, he was ryght wyse, and wolde not be corrupte. For thys cause he easely refrayned and appaysed the people. For that also he shewed hymselfe towardes them, rather a compaignyon, than a duke and gouernour. Furthermore he got not the auctoryte by vnlaufull meanes, nother dyd speake any thynge for to please, but in kepyng hys grauitie, whan men proponed and sett fourth anye thing invtile and v
                     •
                  profytable, he spake frankely agaynst it, though that, in that doing, he incurred the indignatyon of the people. And so often, as he vnderstode, that they Imagyned to do any thynge before that it were tyme, or by crueltye, rather, than by reasone: he reprehended and resrayned them by hys graue speakyng, and by hys auctoryte. And also, whan he sawe them afrayde for any inconuenyent, he put them agayne in courage. In such sorte, that in apparance the gouernaunce of the towne was in the name of the people, but in effecte, al the auctorytie was in hym. Wherethroughe, after that he was deade, it chaunced yt those whiche succeded in hys place, beinge equalle in auctoryte, dyd searche euerye one of them to obteigne the principalite, ouer the other. And to brynge that to passe, they enforced them selues, for to please the will of the people. Which doing, they commytted very many great faultes, lyke as it chaūceth in suche cases in a great cytye, whiche hath empyre and seignyory, but amonge other, the greatest was, that they made a nauigation into Sycile. For they offended, not onely agaynste them, whome they wente to oultrage (begynnyng to warre, vpon them whiche thinge they shulde not haue done) but also againste them, whome they had sent thyder, for that, that they prouided not wel in theyr case by meanes of the troubles and questyons that happened in the cytye, by occasion of thadministration, & of the auctorytye
                     •
                   for the which, the princyyall dyd stryue and debate, through iniuryes and through accusatyons. And by that meane, the sayd armye was defeated in Sycile. And also afterwardes, was loste a greate parte of the armye by sea wyth the apparayle which they had set fourth agayne. And notwitstandynge the sayde losse, and that they were trauaylled in the cytye by cyuile seditions and questyons, and that they had gottone the Syciliens for enemyes besydes the other, and also that the more parte of the allyes had habandoned and forsakē thē, & fynally ye Cyrus sene of the kyng of Perse was allyed with the Peloponesiās, and had geuen them money for to make an armye by sea: yet dyd they resist thre yeares, and coulde not be vainquyshed. vntyl suche tyme, as they being oppressed & troubled by their cyuyle dissensyons, were constrayned to render thēself. wherefore it is clerely apparaūt, y• whan Pericles faylled them, they had yet suche puissance, yt wt his conducte, they might easely haue had the victory of ye same warre.
            
            
               Of some other exploictes of warre, that wree done that same sommer aswell on the one parte as on the other, and howe the cytye of Potyde was rendred by composition vnto the Athenyans. The .xi. Chapter.
               ANd for to retourne to the narration of the sayd warre of the Lacedemonians and theyr allyes, that self same sommer, they raysed vp an armye by sea, wt an houndred shyppes, whiche they sente vnder the cō
                  duct of Cnemus Spartiā,Cnemus. into ye Isle of zeacynthe, which was right

agaynst Elyde, and was inhabyted by the Achayans, that be in Peloponese, but it toke partie wyth the Athenyans, and there pyllaged it all ouer, and wente aboute to take the cytie, but seynge that they coulde not, they retourned. In that selfe same sommer,Aristeus. Aristeus of Corinthe and Polys Argyan in theyr particuler name,Polis. and Anteristes,Anteristus. Nicolaus,Nicolaus. Pratodemus,Pratodemus. and Tymagoras,Tymagoras. as Ambassadours of Lacedemonyens wente into Asia, towardes the king Artaxerxes, for to induce hym to be of theyr allyance in that same warre. and to lende them money to rayse an armye by sea. But before their goinge thider, they came into Thrace towardes Sitalces, sonne of Terreus, for to perswade hym yf it were possyble to leaue the allyance of the Athenyans, and to take theyrs. and in that doyng to leade and conducte hys horsemen with their fotemen, for to rayse theyr, s
                     •
                  ege yt the Athenyans dyd holde before Potyde. And so as they were entred into ye royalme of Sytalces for to go to passe the sea into Hellesponte, wyllinge to go to fynde Pharnaces, sonne of Pharnabasus, whiche shulde brynge them vnto the kynge, they founde wt Sytalces, Learchus, sonne of Callymachus & Ameniedes sonne of Philemon, Ambassadours frō the Athenyans. who perswaded Sadocus, sonne of Sitalces, who had bene made cytezein of Athens, yt he ought to take the sayd Ambassadours & other aboue named, & to rendre them vnto thē, for yt, that they wente to the kynge, for to treate somethyng against the sayd citie. At whose persuasyon, the sayd Ladocus dyd sende hys men after them. Who foūde them at the sea syde where they were willing to embarque themself from thēce, & toke them. Afterwardes, they brought them backe to the said Sadocus, who dely
                     •
                  ered thē vnto the Ambassadours of Athenes, and they caryed thē vnto Athens. And sone after the Athenians, fearing that Aristeus, who had bene cause & auctour of all the affaires that they had hadde at Potyde & in Thrace, shulde yet ymagine moreouer some thynge against them, yf he eskaped, they caused him & all the other to dye the same day wtout any proces, & without hearing ye thing, which they wolde declare. And afterwardes, dyd cast thē frome the height of the walles downe into the dyches. For by that meane they thought wt good cause yt they did vengeaunce for their citezeins & other their allyes marchantes, whiche the Lacedemonyans had taken vpon the sea, & after that they had caused them to dye, had lykewyse caste theim into their dytches. For from the begynnyng of the warre, those Lacedemonians dyd holde for ennemys all those, that they did take vpon the sea, whyder they helde the partye of Athenians, or that they were newter. & caused them to dye without remissyon. Aboute the ende of that same somer, the Ambrasiens hauinge taken wt them one good bende of straungers, wente agaynst the Argyens, which be in the countrey of Amphilochie,Amphilochicū. & againste all the said countrey, for a questyon, which they had newly had with thē. And by thys occasyon Amphilochus sonne of Amphiarus,Amphilocus. who was of the cytye of Argos in Grece, at his retourne from the warre of Troye wolde not retourne into hys countrey for the trouble & sorowe that he had there, & so wente to the goulphe of Ambracie, whiche is in the countrey of Epyre, & there made a citie, whiche he named Argos, in remembraunce of the same, wherof he was, and he added vnto it for surname, Amphilotique, & he named the whole countreye Amphilochie, which was right puyssant of people amonge all the other cities of the countrey of Ambracie. But by succession of tyme, hauing many questyons with theyr voisins & neighbours they were constrayned to retyre and take the Ambracy
                     •
                  ns theyr neighbours into their citie, & compaignye. Which brought them thā furst, the Grekishe language. In suche sorte, that they all dyd speake that same language. For afore, they were straungers as the other Amphylocyens yet be, the

cytye excepted. Afterwarde by successyon of tyme the Ambratians chased the Argyues oute of the cytye, & kepte it alone. who beyng expulsed wente towardes the Acarnanyans, and gaue them selfe vnto them, and altogether, to wytt, the Acarnanians and the Amphilochiens came to demaunde ayde of the Athenians, for to recouer the sayd cytye, who sente them Phormio with .xxx. shyppes,Phormio. which toke the cytye, and pyllaged it, and after lefte it to the Acarnanyans and to the Amphilochiens togethers. By occasyon wherof, the allyance dyd than furste begynne betwene the Athenyans and the Acarnanyans, and the questyon and enemytye betwene the Ambracyens and the Amphilochiens of Argos, for that, that the same Amphilochiens reteigned at that pryze many prysoners of the sayde Ambratiens. who in tyme of thys warre, whereof we speake, assembled a greate armye, aswell of theyr owne people, as also of Chaonyens and of other straūgers theyr neyghbours, and wente thyder to descende before the cytye. And they pyllaged all the territorye therof. But they coulde not take it, and so retourned into theyr houses. These thynges were done that same sommer. At begynnynge of wynter, the Athenyans sente twenty shyppes into the countreye of Peloponese, vnder the conducte of Phormio, who departing frō the porte of Naupacte, watched, that no shyppe myght passe nor enter, nor also departe fro Corinthe nor from Crissee. other sixe they sente vnder conducte of Melessander into Carie and into Lycie,Melesander. for to recouer moneye of them. and to defende, that the marchā
                  tes shyppes of the sayde Athenyans shulde not be spoyled and oultraged, by thē of Plaselide and of Phenice. Melessander, nowe beyng landed in the countrey of Lycie, he was by this enemyes vainquished and slayne, togedres wyth one part of hys people. In the selfe same sommer, the Potydyens seyng that they coulde no longer holde and kepe theyr towne agaynst the Athenyans that had so long kepte it assieged, for the necessyte of darthe & famyne wherin they were, whiche was so extreme, that amonge other fylthy and abhomynable thynges that they dyd eate, there were that dyd eate the one the other, and seynge also that for all ye warre that was made agaynste the sayde Athenyans, that they dyd not retyre from the sayde siege: they came to speake wyth the Capytaynes of the said siege, for the Athenians. which were Xenophon,
                     Xenophon.
                     Hestrodorus.
                   sonne of Eurypedes, Eristiodus, sonne of Aristocles, and Phynomachus sonne of Callymachus,Phenomachus. and rendred themself vpon these conditions. that they of the sayde towne, togethers with theyr men of warre straungers shulde departe and comme fourth, euerye of the men wyth one garment and the women wyth twayne, and moreouer. euery one hadde a certayne somme of moneye to go fromthence. the whiche composytyon, the said capytaynes dyd accepte, consyderynge the incommoditie wherin theyr hoste was, by reasone of the wynter, and also the greate some of monney whiche that same siege had nowe coste, whiche amounted to more, than two thousande talentes. Thus the Potydyēs departed from thence vnder saulue conducte into the coū
                  trey of Chalcyde, euery one the best that he myght. wherwyth the Athenians were ryght euyll contented, saying that they myght haue had it at theyr wylle, and yf they wolde. And yet neuertheles, they sente thyder of theyr citezeyns for to people and inhabyte it. All whiche thynges were done in that same wynter, whiche was the ende of the seconde yeare of that warre which Thucidides hath wrytten.

               THe sommer ensuynge, the Lacedemonyans and theyr allyes came agayne, no more into Attique, but they wente before the citie of Platee, vnder the conduct of Archidamus king of Lacedrmonians. And they, hauyng nowe planted their siege before the towne, and willing for to pyllage and waste the countrey, the citezeins sente their ambassadors vnto them,The oratiō of the Plateans. which dyd speake in thys manner. Archidamns, and you other Lacedemonyans, youe do euill and against your honnour, and the honnour of your fathers, to come enemylyke into oure lande, and to assiege our citye. For Pausanyas Lacedemonyan, sonne of Cleombrotus, who delyuered Grece from the domynation of the Medes, with the Grekes that toke the adnenture of the bataile in our lande, hauynge made hys sacrifyce in the myddest of oure marquet place to the God Iupyter the deliuerer, in the presence of all the hoste, gaue to the Plateans theyr cytye and theyr territorye: to the ende that they might lyue in theyr lybertie accordynge vnto theyr lawes, and that no man shulde make warre nor do them violence vniustly, through couetyce to rule them. And he coniured and swore all the allyes and confederates that were there, to defende thē with their power agaynst all men, that wolde attempte the contrary. This is the

Wherfore, we call to wytnes, them amonge youe that were present at that acte, and also oure domestycall Goddes, and yours agaynst youe, yf you do any harme in oure lande. and also yf commyng agaynst youre othe, you suffre vs not to lyue in oure lybertye, so as Pausanias ordeyned. and more they sayd not.

By occasyon wherof. al thys armye is assembled, and this warre begonne. Wherfore so much the better youe shall kepe youre othe, as youe shall the more ayde to restore them into libertye. And yf you woll not do it, at the leaste, lyue as youe haue lyued, heretofore. And laboure youre lande in peace without takinge parte with the one nor wt the other. But receyue them all as frendes, and helpe not to the warre of one, more than of the other. wyth this aunswere the Ambassadours retourned into the citie, and made theyr reporte before all the people. By whose ordinaūce, they came agayne vnto Archidamus, and sayde vnto hym, that, that which he had demaunded of them was impossyble for them to do wythoute consente of the Athenyans, for that, that they had theyr wyues and chyldren with the Athenyans, and on the other parte, that they feared to put the cytye in great daunger. & after yt the host shuld be departed fromthence the Athenians, not content wyth

that, that had bene done, shulde come vpon them. And also that the Thebayns, who had not bene cōprysed in the othe, vnder coulour, yt the citie ought to receiue thē wt thone partie, & the other, wolde at an other tyme subdewe thē. Whereunto Archidamus aunswered thē, that they shulde haue good hope, and for to exchue all daungers, they shulde put theyr houses, and all the cytye wyth hys territorye into theyr kepinge, & geue them by accompt al the trees that were there, & all the other thynges, that myght be nombred togethers wyth the lymyttes of theyr sayde terrytorye by declaration.

And lycence vs sayth he, to holde them in deposet in your name, and incontynent after the warre ended, we promys to render them intierly vnto youe, and neuertheles thys duryng, to laboure youre landes, and to geue you of the fruictes that, which shalbe necessary for youre lyuyng. vpon thys demaunde the Ambassadours retourned into the cytye, and there proponed & declared it vnto the people, who for resolution, made aunswere, that they so farre, as laye in them, accepted the offre, yf the Athenyans were therwyth contented. But wythout furst cōmoning wyth thē, they wolde in no wyse do nor agre vnto it. And so they demaunded a certayne terme, for to sende vnto Athenes, and that in the meane time there shuld no dō
                  mage be done in theyr lande. whiche thynge was accorded and parformed vnto them. But whan the Ambassadours, which they sente to Athenes, were comme agayne, they made reaporte vnto the people, of the resolution that the Atheniās had made vnto thē, after all the declarations and raysons of the one syde & of ye other, whiche was of thys substaunce. The Athenyans do declare vnto you, that sence that they haue made allyance with youe, they haue not suffred youe to be oultraged nor wronged, and they admonyshe youe, that ye ought to haue remē

For they arne not minded nowe to forsake youe, but woll ayde youe wyth theyr power, and therfore requyre you, to be faythfull vnto them. For as for theym, they intende not to innouate nor charge youe wyth any newe impost. whiche aunswere beyng vnderstande by the Plateans, they determyned not to habandone nor forsake the Athenyans, but to resyste the ennemyes, althoughe they shulde see them bourne and waste before theyr eyes, all the goodes, that they hadde in the countreye, and shulde suffre all the other euyls, that myght be done vnto them. And therfore they wolde no more sende agayne theyr messengers towardes the Peloponesyans, but from the walles made theyr aunswere, that it was not possyble for them to do that, whiche they hadde requyred of them. Than Archidamus came before the walle, and protested agaynst them in thys manner.The protestacyon of Archidamus agaynst ye Plateens. Youe Goddes and saynctes, that kepe the citie & lande of Plateans, I call youe to wytnes, that these here, be they, that furst breake theyr othe, & that the oultrage commeth, not by our faulte, yf we cōme ennemilike into theyr lāde, in the which our aūcesters hauing made their vowes & sacrifyces, had the victorye agaynst the Medes, by your helpe & fauoure.

For that, yt whatsoeuer declarations & exhortacions that we coulde reasonablye make vnto them, we coulde not prouffyt in any thynge, nor allure them with raysone.

And furst, with the trees that were incontynently cut downe, he caused the towne to be inclosed wt greate

barres and skinnes, to the intent that none shulde issue out nor enter therin. Afterwardes, they beganne to rayse vp a bancke, and a mount, hopyng in small time to acheue it, seyng the greate nomber of people that helped to the worke, and by that meane, to take the towne. And the forme of that same douue or mounte was suche. Furste, they made it with braunches of trees, with grates in forme of baskettes, and they sett them of eche syde of the mounte, fastened and susteigned with skynnes for to kepe the earth and other matter, that was put into it. And after they caste in, stoanes, woode, earthe and euery other thynge, yt myght serue to fylle it. In whiche worke, they contynued .lxx. dayes contynuallye, daye and nyght, wythout cessyng from theyr busynes. For whan they one departed for to go to eate or slepe, they other came thyder, euerye one in hys tourne. And for to sollycite and cause the sayde worke to be auaunced & sett forwardes, were deputed and appoincted, the Lacedemonyans, whiche had charge of the huyred souldyars, and wyth them the Dukes and capytaynes of all the cytyes. Whan they of the towne sawe the mounte so to heighynge and aryse, they beganne directly agaynst it in the ynner syde wythin theyr walle, to make an other wall wt stoanes with brecque, whiche they dyd take of the next houses, that they plucked downe for to do it with, and for to susteygne and vpholde it, they meddled it with pieces of woode, and withoutefourthe they armed and fensed it wyth hydes, to the intente that in workynge they shulde not be hurte, and also that yf any fyer were caste agaynste it, it shulde not take in the woode. In suche maner, yt the workynge arose greatly on bothe sydes. And neuertheles they of the towne, for to retarde and slacke the workynge of thennemys, they deuysed one suche mete practique and meane: that is. That they persed the wall at one part ryght anempste the mounte, wherevnto the ennemies hadde from the same forged an other Rāpare wyth woode and wyth earth, which came to ioigne to the walle, for to comme in couert, and secretely vnto the foote of the same walle, after that the sayd mounte had bene acheued. And through that same hoale, that they had made, they drewe and conueyed awaye the earthe vnderneath, which the other did caste into it. Whervpō, after that the Lacedemonians had parceyued it, they made greate panyars, and fylled them with soft and moist earth, and afterwardes dyd caste it in stede of that, whiche was drawen awaye, in manner, that men coulde not easely drawe more away. Also whan the Plateans sawe the remedy, they studyed no further in that partye, but they made greate mynes and conductes wythin the earthe throughe vnder the walle that wente to aunswere vnto the mounte. Throughe whiche mynes, they drewe wythout ceasyng, the earthe from the mounte, & dyd it long before the enemyes parceyued it, thoughe that they were all abashed to see that theyr mount dyd not greatly heyghenne, for the maruelous quantite of earth, that they dyd caste into it, and that it dyd falle and syncke in the myddelle. yet the citezeins, consyderynge that at lengthe they coulde not drawe awaye so muche of the earthe, as the other, that were in greater nomber wythoute comparysonne, myght caste therin: and therfore consideringe that they trauaylled in vayne, they deuysed an other remedye for to resist. yt is, yt at the same part of their walle, where the enemys had approched wt their Rāpare for to assaulte, they raysed & erected wtin wardes, an other walle, in maner of increasing or adioyning, one vnto the other. For the two endes came to ioyne vnto ye wall, directly anempste the two endes of the moūte of ye enemies & went fromthence, enlarging inwardes, into the towne. To the intēt yt yf the ennemies did take ye quarter of the wall, they shuld yet there finde an other, against which, they shulde of necessitie make an other moūte, which shulde be their double

trauaile. & also shuld be in greater daūger. On the othersyde, the Peloponesians had erected two Engynes vpon their mount, where wt they battered in two partes to witte, wyth the one the walle, that they of the towne dyd make within, whiche decayed it greatly, wherof the Citezeins were greatly astonyed: and the other did batter the principal wall. Against which engynes the citezeins vsed two remedies. The one was yt they had great snares of bigge coardes, wt ye which they dyd breake thē. The other was that they had great rollers of woode, which they fastened at two endes to chaynes of yronne, whiche kepte the sayd rollers at the top of the wall, hanged ouerthwart. And whan they sawe the stroke of the Engyne cōminge, they lett slyppe the endes of the chaynes, that were fastened to certayn Engynes, in such sorte, that soubdainely the said rollers came to fall vpō the ende of the Engyne that battred, and did breake hys stroake. Wherupon, the Peloponesiās, seing that after all attemptates, they could not by that meane easely batter the walle, and yet though that it were battred, that there was an other wall within, & by that meane, they shuld with payn take the towne by battry: they determyned to enclose it rounde aboute with a walle. But afore they dyd that, they wolde assaye if they might do it by fyer, whiche thinge semed easy ynough vnto them, if that the wynde serued them, consyderynge that it was very smal. For they studyed all thinges, wherby they might haue it without great expēce & without long sieage. And therfore they filled with fagotts & with wood all the dyche, that was betwene the mounte & the walle in a veray shorte tyme, through ye greate multitude of people, that were at doinge of it. And caused it to be caryed and extended, so farre, as they might within the towne, & afterwardes in the height did put in fyer wyth soulfer and wyth powder. Wherby ther issued fourthwith one so greate a flame, as had neuer bene there sene afore, that hadde bene kindled by mans hande. For sometyme the fyer toke by itself in the woodes by the mountaynes, through the vehemente confrication, freatinge and gatherynge of the trees, whyche happened by force of wynde, wherby arose a greater fyer & flame. And that same fyer was so great and so sharpe, that it faylled very litle, that it had not burned all the towne, with them that were within, for there remayned but one small part therof, where as the fyer had no course. And if the fyer had chased, as the ennemys thought, it had bene done. but it chaunced clene cōtrary. For ther soubdainly came a great rayne with great thōders, as it is said, that quenched it. The Peloponesians, thā seing that they were frustrated &
disapoineted of that their enterprise after ye other, they determyned to leue one parte of thair people at the siege bifore the towne, & that the other shulde retourne, but furst they wold enuiron & cōpasse about all the sydes of ye walles. And for to haue it ye sonner acheued, they departed it amongest thē by quartiers, geuing to al the bendes of euery cytie, his quarter, & also made dyches, all alonge ye said walle, aswell wtin as without, & with the earth, that they drewe out & cast vp, they made bricque. After that they had acheued ye same worke, they left a sufficient nomber of thair people for to kepe the half of that same walle, & they left the other halfe, to be kepte by the Beotyans, and after, the other departed about the saison that the starre named Acturus doth appere, & euery man retourned from thence vnto his house. As touching the Plateans, they had now afore, sent away their wiues yu aged people, the children, & al those, that were not mete to sarue for the warre. In such sorte, that there were abydinge in the towne, but foure houndred and foure skore Athenyans, and ten women alonely for to make them their bread, and more there were not of any estate nor condityon. The whiche determyned for to defende the towne. Such was the preparation of the siege of Platee.
            
            
               
               ¶ Howe the Athenians had an ouerthrow bifore the towne of Spartole in the countrey of Bottians. And the Peloponesians an other bifore the cytie of Stratie in the countrey of Acarnanie. ☞The .xiii. Chapter.
               
                  Xenophon.THat same somer, in the beginning of the said siege, ye Atheniās sent Xenophō, son of Euripides, & .ii. other capitains wt two thousand fotemē citezeins, & two hoūdred horsmen estrangers in haruest season, for to make warre against ye Chalcydyans & Bottians, which be in the coū

But thoder that were not of ye confederatiō, caused a bende of horsmē to come frome the towne of Olinthe. who, being aryued, went fourth wt the people of the town for to fight against ye Atheniās. In which bataile ye fotemē Chalcydyēs, being wel armed, were repulsed & driuē backe euē vnto ye gates. But the horsmē Olynthiās & ye fotemen light armed,Olynthus. wt a certain small nōber of other fotemen, bearing Pauesses or Targots, that were of the contrey, that is called Crusyde,C

And as they retyred on the one syde & on the other frō that same battaille, ther came soubdainly certayn fresh bēdes of fotemē wel armed, which the Olynthiēs sent to increase ye ayde of thē of the town. who, seing ye said succour cōming, toke hart vnto thē agayn, specially the footmen light armed & the horsmē Chalcydyens, & a fresh, wt the succour of the Olynthyās, that was come vnto thē, they set vpō the Athenyans & so dyd repulse & force thē to retire vnto two cōpaignies, which they had left te kepe their baguaige & their artillrie. And yet neuerthelas, those Athenians defended thēselues māfully, & always, as they came liuely vpon their ennemis, they repulsed thē. But after that they were retourned to their said baguaige, ye other did chase thē back again, to wit ye foot men wt shott, & the horse men wt hand strocks, in such sort, that at last they put thē to flight, & had thē long in the chase. In whiche chase, there died many, beside those that were there slayne at the battaile, which were in all four hoūdred & thirty, togidres wt the thre Capytains. The morow folowing, the Athenyās after that they had recouered their dead men of thē of the towne, they retourned wt the remenant of y• army to Athenes. For ye same victory, the Chalcydiens & Bottiens after that they had chosen out & buryed them that were dead on their partie, they erected & set vp an trophe or token of tryūphe bifore the towne. Anon after this battaile, the Ambracyens & the Chaoniens,Ambraciote. Chaones. desiring to subdue all the coūtrey of Acarnanie,Acarnania. & to draw it frō the allyance of the Athenyās, they signefied vnto the Lacedemonyās, that if they wold send thē any nōber of shipps, which they might cause the cyties cōfederated to fournishe, they might easely, wt a thousand of their souldiars, subdewe all the countrey of Acarnanie, for that, that the one might not succour the other. And ye done, they might, w

Cephalenia. & moreouer they had esperance, & trusted the rather to take Naupacte. which doing the Athenyans could no more discourse & sayle aboutes Peloponese,Naupactum. as they had accustomed to do. wherunto the Lacedemonians didde agre, & immediatly sent Cnemus, who yet was their capytaine generall by sea, wt those fewe shipps that they had, & the fotemē, & dyd write vnto the confederated cyties on the sea side that they shuld wt all diligence send thair shippes wel fournished into Leucade.Leucadia. Now those of Corinthe, among the other confedered cyties were most affectioned to the Ambracyens, for yt they were their burgeoses, & therfore

they made extreme diligēce to tacle their shipps & to sende thē vnto thē. likewise did y• Sycioniēs,Sicyonu. & the other nighe neighbours. But those of ye Anactorians & of the Ambratians,Anactoru. Ambraciote. and also of the Leucadyans were sonnest ready at ye poarte of Leucade. Cnemus and the thousand souldiars that he cōducted, vsed so good dyligence that they passed bifore Naupacte without that Phormyo capytaine of the Athenyans,Phormyo. who had ther abowtes .xx. shipps to kepe the passage & the countrey, did perceue thē. So they descended incontynently in the land, nighe vnto Corinthe & they being there, sone after came vnto thē the succours of the sayde Ambracyens, Leucadyens and Anactoryens, and besydes them that were all Grekes, there came thider a great bende of straungers, to wytt, a thousand Chaonyans,Chaones. whiche is a nation, that is not subiecte vnto kynges, but do lyue vnder Dukes, whome they do euery yeare chose of a bloude Roiall. Of whom were Capytaines Phocyon and Nycanor,Phorius. Nycanor. and with them, were the Thesprotiens,Thesproti. whiche lyued likewyse without kinge. And the Molosses and Athytains,Molosse

There was also Orydus,Oroedus. kinge of Paranees, whiche hadde vnder his bende with his men, a thousand Orestyans, subgiettes of the king Anthiochus,Anthiochus. which were come thider by hys knowlaige and consent. Likewyse Perdicas kinge of Macedonie sente thider a thousande Macedoniens withoute knowlaige of the Athenyans,Perdiccas. whych yet aryued not at the begynning, whan the furst dyd. Wyth this armye Cnemus departed frome Corynthe by lande, without wylle to tary for the othere that came by sea, & passinge through the countrey of the Argiues he pillaged the countrey of Lymnea,Argiui.

                   which was not closed with walles. Afterwardes he came against the cytie of Stratie,Stratus. whiche is the greateste of all the countrey of Acarnanie, hopinge, that if he migte haue takenne that same, that he shulde afterwardes right easely take the othere. Whan the Acarnanyans knewe that there was come a great armye vpō them by land, and that they atteded yet, for a more strengthe by sea: they sente no succoures the one to the other, but euery one prepared himselfe to defende his cytie and his lande, and all they togither, sente to Phormyo that he shulde come to succoure them. But he made them annswere that it was not lawfull for him to habandone and departe from the poorte of Naupacte, vnderstandinge that the armye by sea of the ennemys shulde departe from Corynthe. The Peloponesyans than came with thre bendes bifore the sayde cytie of Stratie, beynge determyned to assayle it, if those within wolde not render or yelde it. Of whyche thre bendes, 
                     •
                  pe Chaonyens and other straungers were in that same of the myddest, and in the right hande were the Leucadyens with the Anactoriens & othere of thair bende, and in the laste bende was Cnemus with the Peloponesyans and the Ambrasyens. An
                     •
                   the sayd bendes went marchynge by `dyuers wayes so farre distante the one from the other, that sometime they of the one bende dyd not se the other. And the Grekes went in battaille, kepinge theire order, for to aduyse bisore all thinges, whan they shulde be afore the towne, to chose some meteplace to lodge their campe. But the Chaonyans trustinge in their force, for that, that they were holden and reputed most valyant of all the other straungers in that quarter of the mayne lande, they wold not haue patience to lodge themself, but taking it for shame somuche to cocker themself, and hoping with the ayde of other straūgers that were in their bende, to feare the people of the towne with their arryuall, and by that meane to take it, bifore that the othere shulde there arryue, & so to haue the hole hounour of that same enterprinse: they aduaunsedde themselfe in theire most, that they might, in suche sorte, that they aryued in the sight of the towne, a

good space of tyme ynough, bifore the othere. whiche seing, the Stratyans deu

                  sed among themselfe, that if they coulde discomfytte and ouerthrow that bende: the othere woulde feare afterwardes to come thider, they set embushementes wythout the towne on that parte therof. And after that the Chaonyans were betwene the towne and the Ambusshes, they sette vpon them on both sydes so strongely, that they dyd put them out of Araye and vnto flighte. And so dyd slay many and a great nomber. whan the other strangers that came after, did see thē flye, they dyd the lyke, and so did all flye, bifore that the Grekes dyd parceyue yt, who thought not that they shulde haue fought, but onely haue chosen the place to haue lodged them. But whan they sawe thē so to flye, they retyred into their bende. And afterwardes, they locked themselues togider, and taryed there that same daye, waytinge if those of the towne wold issue fourth agaynst them. which thinge they woulde not do, for that, that thoder Arcananyans hadde sente them no succoure. But onely they dyd throwe againste them wyth castes of slynges, where wyth all those of the countrey of Acarnanie do throwe better, than the other people. Also they were not armed, and therfore yt had not bene good for thē to haue yssued fourth. Than Cnemus, seinge that they came not fourth, whan it did drawe nyghe vpon nyght, he withdrewe himselfe in great feare, to the ryuer of Anapus,Anapus fluuius. whyche is distant from the cytie, aboutes four skoore stades. And the morowe followinge, hauinge recouered the dead men of the Stratyans, he retired with his army into the lande of y• Eniades.Oemniades. who receyued him willingly, for the amytye that they hadde with the Peloponesyans and fromthence they departed all, for to returne into their houses wtout taryinge the succour, that shuld come vnto them. And the Stratians did sett vp their Trophe in remembrance of the victorye, that they had had agaynst the Barbarous or strangers.
            
            
               ¶ Howe the Athenyans had a victory by sea againste the Peloponesians, and howe the one partie, and the other prepared them selfe for to combattre and fight, one other tyme vpon the sea. ☞The .xiiii. Chapter.
               ON the other syde, the armye by sea that the Corynthians and othere confederates shulde haue sent out of the goulphe of Crissee, to the succours of Cnemus agaynste the Acarnanyens if they woulde comme to succour them of Stratia, came not. But were constrayned, that selfe same tyme, that the battaille was bifore Stratia, to fyght againste the .xx. shippes that Phormyo helde and kepte to defende Naupacte, who spied whan they departed from the sayd goulphe of Crissee, for to assaile them in the highe or mayne sea. wherof, the Athenyans, who were not furnyshed to fight, but onely had charged the men of warre for to passe with them into Acarnanie, doubted not. thinkynge that Phormyo, that hadde but twenty shippes, durste not assaile thairs, whyche were seuen and fourty. But as they sayled alongeste the coste of Epire, for to trauerse into Acarnanye, whyche is opposite or directe agaynste yt, sawe the Athenyens comme fourth from Chalcide and oute of the floude of Euenus.The fludde of Euenus. Whoe came dyrectly againste them, for though in the nyght they were hydde in a place, yet alwayes they were in the moarnynge, at breake of daye, apparceyuedde. And by thys meane, the Corynthyans were constraynedde

to fight in the myddest of the destracite. Nowe the people of euery cytie hadde thair capytaynes. And of them of Corynthe were Capytaynes, Machon,Machō. Isocrates,Isocrates. and Agatharcydas.Agatharchidas. and so the Peloponesians dyd bringe theire shippes all into a roundell, locked togyther, the fore partes forwardes, and the powpes inwardes, keping asmuch space, as they might in the sea. for to empeshe & lett the yssue of ennemys, and within that same roūdell they bestowed the smallest and lightest shipps, for to cause thē to go fourth in short space vpō those of thēnemis whan they shulde see it to be mete. As touchinge the Athenyans, they broughte thair shippes all in a renge. And sayled closinge aboutes those of thēnemys, faignynge to be willynge fourthwyth to beginne the bataile, and in passing beyonde them, they approched so strongly, that wel nye they hurkeled togider. By meane wherof, ye other ioygned thēself & retired always more suerlyer locked in their order. But Phormyo had defended or forbydden his men, that they shuld not begynne the bataille, vntill that he hadde geuē them a signe or token. And this he dydde for that, that he thoughte well that the sayde Peloponesyans coulde not maigntayne or contynue that same order wt their shippes, as they woulde haue done, wt their foote men, on lande. And also that the shipps would hurkle togider and woulde empesche thone the other. Specially, whan the wynde of the lande shulde aryse, whyche biganne comēly at the breake of the daye, whiche he attended, makinge in the meane seasonne a bragge or threateninge to be willinge to strike vpon them. For he toke it to be full certayne, that after that the wynd was rysenne, they coulde not be a moment of one houre firme or sure togither, & that he might than assayle them, more at this pleasure, for that, that his shippes were lightest, like as it chaunced. For after that the wynd beganne to blowe, the shippes that were enclosed in the myddell of the oder of thennemys, and the othere that were lightest beganne to hurkle against the other, and successyuely the disorder came the one from the othere. so that the people that were within, was ye more parte occupyed to lay fourth plankes of woode, or their glayues specially bifore, for to defende, that the shippes shulde not hurkle againste them, where they were. Wherby arose a great crye of one sort, that cryed and sayd vylaynye to other, in suche sorte, that they coulde not heare nor vnderstande the thinge that was commaunded them. And yet they that vnderstode it, coulde not tourne nor conduict their shippes, so, as they were cōmaunded, they were so greatly opprest and coustrayned. Also they were not yet instructed perfaictely in the 
                     •
                  eate by sea. Than Phormyo, seinge the disorder, gaue the signe or token of the battaile vnto his people, who charged lyuely vpon the ennemys, and at the arryuall, they did ouerronne one of the Pretoryans galleys, to wytt, vpon which was one of the Capytaines, and so drowned it. And consequently all those, that they encoū
                  tred, at that the furste charge, they frushed or sonke them, with suche strenghte, that they gaue not the ennemys leasure to ioynne themselfe agayne togither, nother to recouer thair courage, but they fourthwyth fledde towardes Patras & Dymen in the quartier of Achaie.Patre. vrbs. Dyme oppidū. And the Athenyans followed them so nighe, that in chasinge them, they dyd take twelue of their shippes and also dyd sleye a great nomber of their people. Afterwardes, they retourned into Mylocryte.Molycricum. And after that they hadde erected and sett vp their throphee vpon the promōtory or highest place, and consecrated a shipp to the god Neptunus, they retourned vnto Naupacte. Also the Peloponesyans wyth the shippes, that were eskaped from Patras and frome Dymen, retourned to Cyllene, where the Athenyans haue their hauen, to the whiche place Cnemus also came at his departure from Leucade after the battaylle of Stratie with the other shippes that shulde haue ioyned

with them there. And they beinge there aryued, Tymocrates,Tymocrates. Brasidas and Lycophron,Brasidas. Lycophron. whome the Lacedemonyans hadde sente for to assiste Cnemus, and had wylled hym to vse their counsaille in feate of the sea, and chiefly, that he enterprised agayne a battaille vpon the sea, to the intente that the ennemys, who had the lesser nomber of shippes, shuld not cōtynue maisters. For they thought well that that same battaille was loste, through faulte of thair people, by many reasons. And chiefly for that, that it was the furst tyme that they hadde foughte in the sea. wherfore they coulde not haue had the arte and industrie to conducte themselues so well, as the Athenyans, who therin were all accustomed. And lykewyse that the victory was not for that, that the Athenyans were more puissant wyth shippes nor with apparaille, but through the ignorance of thair people, which was the cause that they sent ye thre personaiges aboue named, through disdaigne and anger for to geue Cnemus & his people knowlaige of their fault. the whiche parsonnaiges, after that they were arryued, demaunded certayne nō
                  ber of shippes of the cyties, and caused them, that were there, to be repayred, like as they thought good. On ye other side, Phormyo sent his messengers to Athēs for to signefye the victorie vnto the Athenyans, and also to aduertyse them of of the apparaille and preparation, that the ennemys did make afreshe, and that it was nedefull that they shulde sende fourthwith renforte and more power of people, and of shippes. whiche the
Athenya
                     •
                  s dyd. and sent hym twenty shipps wyth good nomber of people. By the conductor whet of, they commaunded him that he shulde incontynently and bifore all thinge, come with all the armye into Crete. And this did they, for that, that a citezein of Crete, named Nycias Gertynyus,Nycias. that was thair frende, had aduertised them, that if they wolde sende thider their armye he wolde cause them to wynne the cytie of Cydonie, whoe toke the contrary parte. But he willed that this were done by meane of the Polichnytes,Polichnyte. who were neighbours of the said Cydonyans. Phormyo than, ensuyng the commaundement of the Athenyans, came into Crete, and from thence into Cydonye, and with the Polichnytes he pillaiged and wasted all the terrytorye of Cydonians, and also was constrayned by force of cōtrary wyndes to tary there longer, than he was willinge. Duringe this tyme, the Peloponesyans, that were in Cyllene, hauing prepared all that whych they thought good for to comme againste their ennemys, they came to Panorme,Panhormus. whiche ys in Achaye, at which place, was the hooste of land that the Peloponesyans had sente thider for to succour & ayde that same by sea.

And lodged themself all roūde aboute, wythout that same, for that, that it dyd take their parte and straight against it of the same coaste of Peloponese, there was one other, distant or beinge a sunder the space of seuen stades or theraboutes by sea, whyche caused the mouthe and the entrye of the Goulphe of Erissee. The Peloponesians also came to an other promountorie of Achaie, whiche was not so farre distant from the cytie of Panorme. where they had their armye by lande. And they had the nomber of .lxxvii. shippes armed. Than the twoo armyes, beinge in sight the one of the othere, they kepte themselues sixe or seuen daies in their fort, for to make their preparations, and to aduise of the manner of the battaile. For the Peloponesians, by reason of the feare, and remembrance that they had of the former discomfiture, durste not issue fourth at large into the mayne sea. Also the Athenyans woulde not enter into the distroicte, knowinge that it was for their disaduauntage. And in the meane tyme, Cnemus & Brasidas and the other capytaynes of the Peloponesians, seinge that thair souldyars

were astonyed and afrayed by meanes of the former ouerthrowe, they causedde them all to assemble and did speake vnto them in this manner.
            
            
               ¶The exhortation of the dukes Lacedemonyens to their souldyars. ☞The .xv. Chapter.
               IF there be any of youe, lordes Peloponesyans, that feareth to come vnto this battaille by reasone of the other, which we loste: he groundeth his feare nother wel, nor vpon good cause. For our preparation and apparaille was not than suche, as apperteigned. For that menne thought not to come to fight by sea. But rather that voyage was onely to cary and transporte our armye into the lande. wherein, inconuenyences chaunced vnto vs, whyche were not small, by mysfortune, and it might be partly by ignorāce, beinge the furste tyme that youe hadde fought by sea. wherefore, knowinge and consyderinge that we were not vainquished by the force and vertue of our ennemys, but rather that there be raysons to ye cōtrary: It is not raisonable, that we shulde nowe be destitute of couraige. But we ought to consider, that albeit that oftimes men of estymation do faile and lose by fortune of warre: yet neuerthelas they haue and reteigne their vertue and hardynes of harte. the which they iudge not to haue lost by the former faulte and imprudentie. & likewyse they be neuer descouraiged nor tired. And as touchinge your parte, truly, though you haue not so much knowlaige in this busynes by sea, as our ennemys haue, yet haue you asmuche and more hardynes and vertue. And as touchinge the industrie of them here, whome youe feare, if the same be accōpaigned with hardynes, yt shal know well how to execute in great daungers, that, which it shall haue learned by excercise. But if that be lackinge, the arte shall sarue nothinge at all. For feare taketh awaye the memory. And the arte, without the vertue of harte and couraige, profiteth nothinge in daungers. wherfore it behoueth you, for somuche as they haue more experyēce: to haue against it, more audacytie. And for the feare, which youe haue, for yt, that ye were vainquished, ye ought to call to remēbrance, yt you were not prepared nor disposed for to fight. And besides this, cōsider, yt we haue many more ships thā our ennemis, & that you shal fight in ye sight of our army, yt is here on lande, for to do vs pleasure & that by reasone, those, that be in greatest nōbre & best appoincted, shuld haue the better. Also we parceyue not one onely raisone, wherby we shuld haue any fear, but the fault, that we heretofore haue done, maketh vs by the experience the better instructed. Haue youe all than good courage, aswell capytaines & souldyars, as maronners, and do euery one his offyce, without habandoninge and forsakynge the places, wherinto youe arne ordeyned. For also we, that be your dukes & heddes, wol not geue youe lesse cōmodytie to fight, thā those, y• shulde conducte you to the other battaile
                     •
                   nor also any occasion or example to be wery & fayntharted. And if there be any, that shal shewe himself such, he shalbe punyshed accordynge to his deserte. Likewyse those, that shall shewe themself to be valyaunt, shalbe recōpensed & reputed according to the merytt of their vertue. By such words & declaratiōs, they did animate & encourage the Peloponesiās, their souldyars. On ye other side, Phormio, seing that hys souldyars were also afraide for the great nōber of ships that they sawe against them, caused them likewise to assemble, & comforted thē, sor that, that alwayes he had assured them, that there coulde not comme againste them one so greate an armye by sea,

that they were not hable to resiste. And they themselues, for that they were Athenyans, had conceyued thys presumption in their mynde, that they neuer would recueile bifore any armye by sea, that they shulde se of the Peloponesians, howe great so euer it were. But parceyuinge them to be afrayde, he deliberated to put them againe in courayge, and so spake vnto them in this manner.
            
            
               ¶The Exhortation of Phormio, to the souldyars Athenyans. ☞The .xvi. Chapter.
               I Haue deuysed to calle you here togither, seing you somewhat afrayed for the greate nomber of ennemys. whyche I fynd to be an euil thing, to feare the same, whiche is not to be feared. For those here, haue assembled this nomber of shippes muche more greate, than ours: for feare, that they haue of vs, hauynge remembrance of the victorie, that we hadde last against them: and knowynge that they be not hable, so many for so many, to compare with vs. And also they come with thonely thing, wherin they haue their affiance, that ys, wyth greate nomber of fotemen (for that, that they haue often had victorie in battaille by their meane) thinkinge that they woll do asmuche in the fyghte by sea. whiche is an abuse. For this, that yf they haue any industrie & perceuerance or power in that same manner of fyghtinge, we haue much more greate, in this same here. For of courage, we therin haue the one as the other, but in that, that we be experymented the one in the sea and the other by lande, yt maketh euery of vs for his parte more bolde & audacyous, in that thing, wherin we haue most experyēce. On the other parte, the Lacedemonyans, for somuch as they be heddes and princes of other confederats, for to recouer their honour, do constrayne them agaynste thair wille, to come afreshe to proue the fortune of battaille, whiche thyng they woulde not do willyngly, being vainquished. wherfore youe ought not by any meanes of the world, to feare the audacyte and hardy
                     •
                  es of them, vnto whome youe haue geuen greatest and moste certaine feare. aswel for that, that you haue one time vainquished thē, as also for this, that they haue this same opynyō of vs, that in resisting thē, we wol do some thing, worthy of memory. And on the other parte, they that be in greateste nomber, comme to battail, trusting more in their force, than in their conducte. where they, that parceue themself to be weakest and feblest of people and preparation (if they be not forced to fight) 
                     •
                  uttinge their suertie in their vnderstandinge and prudency, procede mooste valyauntly in their busynes. whiche thinge considered by them here, they be more afraide of that, and not without cause, than they be of our preparatiō. For also it hath bene often sene, that the greatest puissance hath bene vainquished by the lesse, sometyme through ignorance and lacke of knowlaige, sometyme for lacke of couraige and of conducte. The whych two thinges be not in vs. And yet neuerthelas I wylle neuer be of opynyon to fight wythin the distraict, and that we shulde go thider to assayle them. For I knowe very well, that that, ys not for thaduantage of them that haue light shippes and smal vnder cōduct of good patrons and maronners, for to goo to assaile in a straicte place thē, that be in greater nomber vnder conducte of newe & inexpert people. Insomuche as a man shulde not go in suche case to assayle them, but whan he seith afarre of, his aduauntaige. And also whan he ys in such narow and straight place, he may not

retire whan he is in daunger, and for effecte a man may not go and come agayne at hys pleasure, which is the industrie & facyō of light shippes & of good maronners. But rather a man is constrayned to

                  ight, as in mayne lande amongest fote men, in whiche case, they that haue greater nomber of shippes, haue the greateste aduauntage. But as touching that, I woll therunto haue eye, somuch as I may. And as concernynge youe, it is conuenient, that euery of you holde and kepe him in this place, that hath bene appoincted him within youre shippes. And to obeye readely vnto that, that shalbe commaunded. For this chiefly, that thoccasion of victorie consisteth and resteth in the readynes and diligēce to assaile, whan tyme is. And moreouer in 
                     •
                  ightinge take good hede to your takle, and to kepe sylence. whiche thinges be very requysitte and sittinge, in all battailes, but aboue all, in the sea. Charge therefore vpon thies here, in kepinge the honnoure that youe haue acquyred against them. And consider, that it is a question at thys conflicte of a very great matter, to wyt, whider you shall depriue ye Peloponesiās of hope to sayle from thens forwardes, or yt you shall putt the Athenyans in greate feare to goo to the sea. And to ende reasoninge, remember youe for one thinge, that we haue vainquished a great part of them here in battaille, and that they that haue bene ones vainquished, haue not the harte, so sone assured in like daungers. In thys manner did Phormyo instructe and encourage his souldyars.

But whan the Peloponesians did see them to marche by from the shoore to lande, and that they were nowe wt in the destroicte, whiche was the thynge that they demaunded, they retourned all at ones agaynste them. And geuynge token of battaile, they toke their course agaynste them with the greateste diligence that they coulde, hopinge to enclose them and to take them all. But .lxx. shippes of the Athenyans that wente bifore eskaped, & saued thēself in the mayne sea. The other, that thought to saue thēself by land, were takē by the Peloponesiās & destroyed. And ye people, that could not swymme to land, were slayn. And afterwards they caryed away the voyde ships with theirs. For there was but one onely taken with the people that yt caryed,

The Peloponesians came after, singing ye songes of victory, as people that had vainquished. Amōgest the whyche one shippe of Leucadyans came a great space bifore all the other, geuinge the chase to one of them of the Athenyans, whiche abodde behinde. So yt chaunced by fortune, that there was one small carrecte at ancre, very nighe the poorte, wherunto the Athens shipp, that was chased, came to ioygne for to saue himself. And as the same of Leucadyans, with force of sailes and with oores did pursue yt, he happenned bitwene them bothe and so was incontynently sonken, whereby the Peloponesyans that had no doubte therof, were somewhat astonnyed, and for that, that they were not in battaill but folowed at the bayt, as people that had the victorie, and gaue the chase, they stayed a litle and cessed to saile, taryinge the other that followed them with feare, that if they approched more nighe, the Athenyans wolde issue fourth vpon them to their aduantage. And so goynge fayre and properly with the sayle, they entred into certayne bankes for that, that they knewe not well the place. whyche parceyuynge the Athenyans they toke courage agayne, and the one, encouraginge the othere, they came to charge vpon them, whoe knowinge the faulte that they hadde done and that they were in disorder susteignedde the brunte, a litle at the begynninge, but sone after they tourned the backe and gaue themself to flight towards the place, fromwhence they were departed. Yet alwayes there remayned sixe, whiche the Athenyans did take, and also recouered their empty shippes that the selfe Athenyans hadde that same houre fastened on grounde, and of the ennemys they dyd slaye one partie, and the other parte, they reteigned

               How the Peloponesians failled to take the poorte of Pyreus secretely or by stealthe. ☞The .xviii. Chapter.
               BUt bifore that the shippes of the Peloponesyans departed from Corinthe and oute of the goulphe of Crisee, Cnemus and the othere rulers, through the requeste & incouraigemēt of the Megariens, wolde assaye to take the port of Athens, named Pireus. which was not kept nor also closed. For that, that the Athenyans that were muche more puissant by sea, than all the other, feared not that any woulde come to assaile them in their porte. And so they ordeyned, that euery of the marōners with an oare, and a lyne wherwith men bynde them, and a skynne of that same, whereupon, they lye wtin the shipp, shulde go by lande frome Corinthe, vntill the sea that is foranempste Athens. And fromthence they shuld go all togither to Megare with moste diligence that they mighte. And oute of the place of Nysee, where is the hauenne of Megarians, they shuld toawe fourty galleys, in the whiche they shulde go soubdainely againste the sayde poorte of Pyreus, wherin were no shippes, and there was also no greate watche, for that, that the Athenyans neuer doubted thereof. For it neuer chaunced that any shippe dyd aboorde there openly or secretly that was not parceyuedde. Hauinge than the Peloponesyans well preparedde their case, they toke their iourney. And beinge by nighte arryuedde at Nysee, they embarqued themselues vpon the shyppes, that they founde there, and raysed vppe their sayles for to sayle towardes Pyreus. Wythout hauynge any more feare of anye manner of thynge. But they hadde (as it is sayde) the wynde somewhat contrary. Nowe was there vpon the promontorie, whyche is agaynste Salamyne, on the coste of Megare, a bastillion which certayne souldyours Athenyās did kepe, and in the sea benethe them thre galleys, whych was there to empesche and lett, that nothynge shulde enter nor issue fourth from the towne of Megare, The whyche bastillion, the Peloponesyans assaulted, and at the arryuall, dyd take the thre galeys whyche they founde empty, and caryedde them awaye. Afterwardes, all at one tyme, one partie amongeste them entred into Salamyne, bifore that it was parceyued and dydde pillage yt. But in the meane tyme, they, that were wythin the bastillion, whyche yet defendedde themselfe, didde kyndle lyers for to make signes to them of Athenes, that the ennemys were comme. whereof the Athenyans were somuche or more afraide, than of any other thing, that happenedde vnto them in all this warre. For they that were in the cytie, thought that Pyreus had bene already takē. And they, that were in Pyreus, reconed ye Salamyne being taken, there rested nothing, but that thennemis wold come also to take them, whiche thing they mighte easely haue done, if they had not bene empesched by the wynde, and kepte backe by feare. But durynge this, at the dawninge of the daye, all the people of Athens issued fourth on a heape, and toke their ships, that were at Pireus, & after yt they were embarqued, they sailed towardes Salamyne with the moste diligence that they coulde, leuinge a good nomber of fotemen within Pyreus. Whan the Peloponesians parceyuedde their comminge, they aduaunced themselfe to wythdrawe their butyne, pray, and the prisonners of Salamyne into their shippes. And that done, with the thre ships that they had takenne in the poorte of the castelle of Budore, they retourned to Nysee. For they didde not assure themself well in thair shipps for that, that they

had bene longe on drye ground in the hauen. wherfore they thought yt they were not for to indure well the sea. And after that they were descended at Nysee, they returned by lande to Megare. And fromthence, to Corynthe. On the othere syde, whan the Athenyans were arryued at Salamyne, seing that the ennemys were nowe departed, they retourned likewyse vnto Athenes. And fromthence fourthwardes, they fournished better their poorte of Pyreus, aswel with closure, as wt defence or watche.

The one for his name & proffytt, and the other in fauour of the Atheniēs. For the same Perdiccas, being in great extremyte, for that, that on the one syde, Philippe his brother wolde haue chased hym out of his roiaulme with the helpe of the said Sitalces, and on the other, the Athenyans were mynded to moue warre againste him, he promysed to Sitalces many things if he made the appoinctmēt bitwene him and the sayd Athenians, & gaue no ayde to Phillip his brother against him. And moreouer in makyng of the sayd appoinctment wt the Athenyans, the sayd Sitalces had promysed thē, yt the said Perdiccas shuld make warre against the Chalcidiās. which thing Perdiccas had ratefied, & yet had not done yt.

                  , than for him that demaunded it, for to be denyed. And also the prynces, oftentymes vsed that same custome imperially and by constraincte, for vnto them that refused to geue them, they denyed all traffique and marchaundise. And by these meanes, that same royaulme was comme to a marueillous greatenes. For it was the greaste yt than was in Europe, frome the goulphe of the sea Ioniū vnto the bridge Euxin. that is to wytte of reuenue and of ryches. But of nomber of people and of good warryours, it was muche lesse, than the same of the Scythians. vnto whome whan they were both ioyned and agreing togeders, nother the Thracyens, wherof we speake, nor any other one natyon, that was in Europe or in Asia, coulde not resiste. Also they haue a prudencye and dylygence in theyr fourme of lyuyng, all of an other sorte, than all the other haue. Sytalces than hauynge so greate & so puyssaunte a royaulme, as we haue declared, after that he had assembled all his armye and his preparatiō, he toke hys waye for to go into Macedonie, furst throughe hys countreye, and after by the mounte Cercyne,The moūt of Circine which is ouerall inhabyted. and departeth the countreye of Synthyans, from the same of Peonyens, and he followeth the waye that he before tyme had made, whan he made warre agaynste the sayde Peonyans, cutting the wood ouerthwarth the mountaygne, leuynge on the ryght hande the sayde Peonyans, & on the lefte, the Synthyens & Meedes. Hauyng thā ascēded agayne that same moūtaygne, he came to Dobere,Doberus. which apperteigneth to the sayde Peonyans, withoute that, that hys hoste dyd in any thynge dymynysh it, though that many of the people were diseased, by meane that many Thracyens followed the armye wythout wages and wythoute hauynge hope to gaygne, in suche manner, that he hadde (as it is sayde) fewe lesse, than a houndred and fyfty thousande men. wherof, aboute the thyrde parte, were horsemen, of whome the more parte and the better, were the

Odrisians, and the reste, Getes, and of the footemē, the Matheriferyans, which be one of the natyons, that inhabyte in the mounte of Rhodope, lyuynge in libertye, were the beste warryours. But the nomber that followed of al nations, was so greate, that, at the syghte onely, it was fearfull. Beyng than all arryued at Dobere, they so
                     •
                  ourned there certayne fewe dayes, and made prouysyon for that, whiche was necessary for them, for to assayle the countreye of Macedonye, that was benethe that mountaygne,The beginning of the Royaulme of Macedonye. whiche dyd obeye vnto Perdicas. For all the Macedonyans were not in hys obeyssance. But the Lyncestes and the Eluniores, all whiche be Macedonyans, althoughe that they had allyance wyth him, and also dyd hym some seruyce, yet they had theyr partycular Kynges. For that, that Alexander, father of Perdicas and theyr progenytours, surnamedde Temenides, departed furste frome the cytye of Argos, and came to the countrey of Macedonie. And at the begynnynge, toke that parte, that presentlye is called, Macedonye marytimate, by force. And chased oute of the countreye, that is named Pyerie, the Pyeryans. Who afterwardes came to inhabyte beyonde the mounte Strymone vnder the mounte Pangeus in the towne of Phagrete,

                     Phagres.
                   and some other. Whereby, yet at thys presente, the countreye, that is vnder the sayde mounte Pangeus, drawynge agaynste the sea, is called Pyerienne. They chased also oute of the countreye of Bottiee, the Bottiens. who presently inhabyte the borders of Chalcydyans, and also occupyed a small portyon of the countreye of Peonyans, nyghe to the floude, Azius.The floude of Agius. to wytt, from the moū
                  taygnes, vnto Pelle, and so vnto the sea syde. And also beyonde the sayd floude they toke the regyon that ioygneth to the mounte Strymone, whiche is called, Migdonye,Migdonia. from whence they chased the Edonyans. And oute of the countreye of Eordie, the Eordyans. Of whome they dyd slaye a verye great part, the other wythdrewe them selfe, about the cytye of Phiste,Phista. where they yet, at thys presente, do inhabyte. Also they chased the Almopyans from theyr lande, named Almop

                  e,Almopia. and besyde those there, they subdewed and brought into theyr obeissā
                  ce and subiectyon manye other people of Macedonyens, which, yet at thys presente, obeye vnto Perdicas, to wytt, those of Anthemont, of Grestonie, of Bisaltye and other manye countreys, whiche all be called Macedonye. And all obeyde to Perdicas, sonne of Alexander, whan Sytalces wente to make agaynste hym the warre, whereof we speake. The Macedonyans, vnderstandynge hys commynge, and knowynge that they were not myghtye ynoughe for to resiste hym, withdrewe them selfe into theyr places and townes walled. Whereof, there was not than anye greate nomber. For those that men do see there at thys presente, were enclosed by Archilaus,Archilaus. sonne of Perdicas, that reigned after hym. And he caused the wayes to be repayred. And furnyshed the royaulme wyth horse, wyth harnoys, and all other apparaylle of warre, more than the eyght kynges, that raygned afore hym, all togeders had done. The hoste of the Thracyans than at theyr departynge frome Dobere, entred at the arryuall into the countrey whiche hadde bene Philipps, brother of Perdicas. And toke by force the towne of Idomene and them of Gortynie,

                   of Atlante and some other by composyty on, for the amytie that he had wyth Amyntas, sonne of Philyppe, who was with him. After he came to the towne of Europe,Europus. thynkyng to haue taken it by force, but he coulde not. And so he departed frō thence, ouerthwart the coūtrey of Macedonie, which is of the right hande of Pelle & of Cyrre. But he neuer entred diepe into the coūtrey, to wytt, into Bottiee nor Pierie. but he ouerrōned & pillaged the coūtreys of Grestome, of Migdonie & of Anthemōt. The Macedonyans, seynge that they had not foote men to matche wyth the

Thracyans, they assembled, certayne good nomber of horsemen of theyr neyghbours, which dwelled in the moūtaignes. And although that they were in much lesse nomber, than the ennemys, yet they came to assaylle them. And on that syde where they charged vpon them, nothynge abodde them. For they were good warryours, and well armed. But beynge sone enuyroned by the greate nomber, althoughe that they for a certayne space defended themselues, yet, seyng that a
                     •
                   lengthe they coulde not resiste agaynst so greate a nomber, they retyred, and in that conflicte Sytalces dyd speake vnto Perdicas, and shewed hym the causes for whiche he made warre agaynste hym. After that, Sytalces, seynge that the Athenyans were not come wyth theyr armye by sea, lyke as they had promysed, but onely had sente towardes hym theyr Ambassadours with certayne guistes, thinkynge that he shulde not haue enterprysed nor executed that same warre, sente one parte of hys armye into the quarter of Bottiens, and one other, into ye same of Chalcydians. who, perceyuing the comminge of thennemyes, were retyred into theyr townes. and suffred them to waste and pyllage theyr countrey. And he, beynge in the same quarter, the Thessalyans, that inhabyt on the southe syde, the Magnetes and the other, that be vnder the Empyre of the sayde Thracyans, Ioynynge to Thermopyles, fearynge that he woulde come vpon them, putt them selues in armure. And lykewyse they, that inhabyted in the plat countreye beyonde the mounte Strymon on the southe syde, and also the Panyans, the Odonians, the Droyans and the Dersians, all whiche, be people lyuynge in lybertye. And of the other parte, the bruyte was amonge the Grekes, ennemyes of Athenyans, that the same Sytalces for the allyance that he hadde wyth the same Athenyans, had vnder couloure of that warre of Macedonie, assembled that armye for to come agaynste them in fauor of the sayde Athenyans. Wherevpon the sayde Sytalces, parceyuynge that he came not to the ende of that, which he had enterprysed, and dyd nothynge but waste the countrey wythoute conquerynge it, also that victuailes fayled hym, and that wynter drewe nyghe, by the counsayle and perswatyon of Senthes, sonne of Spardocus, who was hys cousynne Germayne, and the chyefe and most puyssant of hys armye next hymselfe, determyned to retourne assonne, as he coulde. Nowe had Perdicas gotten secretely the sayde Senthes to be hys frende, by meane that he had promysed to geue hys suster vnto hym in maryage, togeders wyth a greate somme of monneye. By this meane than, Sitalces, after that he had taryed .xxx. dayes, and no more, in the coūtreye of the enemies (wherof he had consumed .viii. whole & entier daies in the countreye of Chalcyde) he retourned into hys royaulme wyth hys armie. A

               Of certayne exploites of warre that Phormyo dyd in the countrey of Acarnanie, and of the begynnyng of the same countrey. ☞The .xx. Chapter.
               IN that self same wynter, whereof we speake, after tharmye by sea of the Peloponesians was retyred and disseuered, Phormyo, with the people, that he had at Naupacte in armes, sailled towardes Astace.Astacū. & beynge there arryued, sett on lande thre houndred of hys maroners

all armed, wyth asmany Messenians. with whome, he entred into the countrey mediterraine of Acarnanie. And oute of the townes of Strate, of Coronte, and out of many other, he chased the inhabytantes, that semed vnto hym to be affectioned, or partyes wyth the Peloponesyans. And after that he had sett agayne Cynetes, sonne of Theolyte within Coronte,, he retourned into hys shyppes wt hys people, and durste not go agaynste the Oeniades, who onely amongest the Acarnanyans, had alwayes bene ennemyes of the Athenyans. For feare, that he had to demoure and tary there in wynter seasonne. For that, that the ryuer of Achilous,The ryuer of Achelous. which descendeth out of the mount Pyndus,The moūt o
                        •
                      Pindusand passeth by the Dolopyans, by the Amphilochiens, by the plat countrey of Acarnanie, and through the cytye of Strate, and after, by the countrey of Oeniades, and than commeth to descende into the sea: retourneth ryght agaynste the towne of the sayde Deniades. In such sorte, that the countrey there is almoste not habytable in wynter, for men of warre. By cause of the contynuall crekes and washynges away of the earthe, that it causeth. And also there be dyrectly agaynste the regyon of Oeniades certayne of the Isles Eschinadians. whiche be very lytle dyfferente frome the ouerflowynges of Achelous.Achelous. For by the earth that the ryuer, whiche cometh frome the mountaygnes as it were a floude, doth carye thyder, some of the same, do ioygne vnto the mayne lande, and the people of the countreye do beleue, that by successyon of tyme, they so shall ioygne togeder. For that, that it oftentymes reygneth there, whereby the ryuer groweth very grosse, which caryeth alway a great quantyte of sande. Also the Isles there, be very thicke or nygh ioyned togeder, so that well nyghe, the one maigneteygneth the other togeder, by meanes of the refuse, that the ryuer bringeth thyder, not by order & in a range. For than the force of the ryuer wolde breake it. But one tyme in one place & an other tyme in an other, so that men coulde skarcely departe frome the same Isles into the sea, and also they be small, rude and deserte. And it is sayd, that whā Alcmeon sonne of Amphiaraus, had slayne hys mother, beynge by contynuall tourment of horryble visions, constrained to wander through the worlde, and coulde not arreste in any parte, he was admonyshed by the oracle & aunswere of the God Apollo, to go to inhabyte in that lāde. For the said oracle aunswered hī in thys manner. that he shulde neuer be delyuered from those fearefull vysyons, vntyll that tyme, that he had founde for to inhabite, the regyon, that hadde not bene sene of the sonne, & that had not bene lande, before the death of hys mother. For yt, that all other lande was prophane vnto hym, & accursed for the mysdede of murder, yt he had comytted in the parsone of hys mother. Who, after yt he had longe studyed, howe that he might fynde thys lande, aduysed wt himself, that i
                     ••
                   was the ouerflowinges of Achelous. In which place after the death of hys mother, was increased by the alluuyons or ouerwashynges, lande ynoughe for hys habytaciō, besydes that, which was there before, by meanes that he had now erred & wandred aboutes a longe tyme after the death of hys mother. And so he inhabyted & raigned there, nygh vnto the quarter, where be at thys presente the Oeniades. And by cause of hys sonne, named Acarnanus, he called that regyō Acarnanie. Thys is yt, which we haue vnderstāded of Alcmeō. And for to retourne to our hystorye, Phormion, being wt the Athenians, that he brought agayne out of the countrey of Acarnanie vnto Naupacte, went in the beginning of the fyrste spring tyme to Athens by sea. And caryed away the prysonners, that they had takē in that warre, which were franke, & free, & not bonde men. The which al were bought agayne or redemed. Also they ledde wyth them the wastes of the shyppes, that they had taken. And thus passed the wynter, whiche was the ende of ye thyrde yeare of the warre, whereof Thucidides hath wryttonne.

               ¶Howe the cytie of Mythilene, wyllynge to rebelle agaynste the Athenyans, was by them assieged, and howe they sente vnto the Peloponesyans for to haue succours, and of an ouerthrowe, that the sayde Athenyans hadde in Noricque. ☞The fyrste Chapter.
               IN the begynnynge of the somer, whan the corne was alreadye greate, the Peloponesyans entred agayne into the Attique warre, vnder the conducte of Archidamus theyr kynge, pyllagynge and wastynge so, as they had accustomed, the other yeares. Howbeit the horsemen, that were in the cytye, came fourth oftetymes vpō the footemen of the ennemyes lyghtly armed, whiche came there the more parte to runne for to watche, that they shulde do no euyll to the places, nyghe to the cytye. And the sayde Peloponesyans demoured in that lande, so longe as they had victuayles, and after, euery man retourned into hys quarter. But at the begynnynge whan they were entredde: all the inhabytantes of the Isle of Lesbos, (excepted them of Methymne) were rebelled agaynste the Athenyans. and tourned vnto the Peloponesyans, whiche thynge they were mynded to haue done, before the begynninge of the warre. But the Lacedemonyans were not willyng to receyue them, and yet at that tyme dyd declare, that they were not therein determyned. For yf they shuld do it, they were of force co
                     •
                  strained to fortefye theyr poortes, to make agayne and repayre theyr walles, and to make shyppes. And also they attended for victuayles, for archers and for other prouisyons, that they had sente to seke in the countrey of Ponte. But the Tenedyans, who were theyr en
                     •
                  emyes, the Methymnyens, and some particulars of the cytye of Mytilene, (which for the parttakings that were in the towne, were become burgeoses of Athens) aduertysed the Athenyans that the cytezeins of the sayde towne of Mitilene, constrayned all the inhabytantes of the Isle, to comme vnto them, and to retyre into the cytye, to thintent to rebelle frome the sayde Athenyans. And that they made all the preparatyons to them possyble, for to do it, throughe the perswatyon of the Lacedemonyans, and of the Beotiens theyr parentes. In suche sorte, that yf the sayde Athenyans dyd not fourthwith prouyde therfore, they shulde lose the sayde Isle of Lesbos. Neuertheles those Athenyans, consydering that it shulde be a thyng very harde after the pestylence, that they had hadde, so greate, and hauynge the ennemies in theyr lande, to make a newe armye and enterpryse agaynst them of Lesbos, who were yet in theyr intier and hoole power, and had greate nomber of shyppes: they wolde not at begynnynge beleue that it was so, for that they were not wyllynge, that it shulde be so trewe. And they rebuked them, whiche made reaporte therof vnto thē, saying that it was nothing, and that they dyd yll to charge the sayde Mytilenians. Notwithstandyng after that the Comissaryes, whiche they had sente thyder for to knowe the trouthe, hadde reaported vnto them, that they of Mytilene, wolde not sende awaye the people of the Isle that they had caused to comme into theyr cytye, nor also desist and cease from the preparations for warre, which they made: fearinge that they wolde rebelle, were mynded to preuente it. And sente into that partye, fourtye shyppes, whiche they had all made readye for to sende into Peloponese, vnder

the conducte of Cleipides,Cleipides. sonne of Dynyn & of two other Capytaynes. For they were aduertysed, that ryght shortly shulde be the feaste of Apollo in Malaente, which is nyghe vnto the cytye of Mytilene, wherevnto all the cytezeins or the more parte of them came yearelye. Wherefore yf they hasted to go thyder, they myght take them there so
                     •
                  bdaynely. and yf they coulde not execute that, yet commynge vpon them with that armye, they myght commaunde them to delyuer all theyr shyppes that they hadde, and to beate downe theyr walles. And in case they refused, to denounce warre agaynste them, before that they shulde be prouyded and fortefyed. For thys occasyon the Athenyans dyd sende the said fourtye shyppes, and moreouer reteignedde tenne galeys, which the Myt
                     •
                  lenyans had sente vnto them, by vertue of the allyaunce. And all the men that were wythin them, they put into prysone. Notwithstandynge, one of the countreye, that was at Athens, departed wyth dyligence by sea, and came into Eubee, and from thence, by lande vnto Gereston. Where he founde a marchauntes shippe, whiche wolde departe fromthence to sayle vnto the sayde Mytilenyans. Whereinto he entred, and had so good wynde, that the thyrde daye after hys departure from Athens, he arryued at the porte of Mytilene. And incontynently aduertysed them of the towne, of the commynge of the Athenyans shippes. which vnderstode, they went not fourth the daye of the feaste for to go to Malaente. & also they caused with all dylygence to repayre theyr walles, where they were fallen downe, and to fortefye theyr porte the beste that they myght. Anone after, arryued the shyppes of Athens. Who seyng the apparaylle and preparatyō that the cytezeins dyd make, expounded vnto them the charge that they had to commaunde them. That they shulde delyuer theyr shyppes, and beate downe their walles. And seyng that they dyd refuse it, they prepared themselfe to comme for to assayle them. Wherby they of the towne, as people surprinsed and betrapped, although that at begynnyng they yssued to the mouthe of poarte, makyng threatenynges to be wyllynge to fyght: Yet after that they dyd see the shyppes of the Athenyans commynge agaynste them, they retyred and came to a parliamente wyth the Capytaynes of the Athenyans. And fynally they sayde, that they were contente to render all theyr shyppes, yf they myght haue any good composition and raysonnable appoinctment of the reste, wyth the Athenyans. Wherevnto ye Capytaynes dyd agree wyllynglye, fearynge also that they were not myghtye ynough for to subdue all the Isle. And vpon thys, they toke truse. Duryng the whiche, they of Mytelyne sent in Ambassade vnto the Athenyans, some of theyr cytezeins. amongest whome, was one, that had discouered the reuolte and rebellyon to the sayde Athenyans. Who afterwarde had chaunged opynyon for to se, yf they coulde so well excuse the case and pourge the suspytyon vnto the Athenyans, that they wolde be contente to call backe theyr armye by sea, whiche was at Mytilene. And neuertheles on the other syde, they sente other messengers vpō a gallyon to the Lacedemonyans, wythoute knowelayge of the Athenyans, whiche helde the porte assieged. For that, that theyr armye kepte themselfe on the northe syde of the sayde porte towardes Malee. And thys dyd the sayd Mytilenyans, for that they had no hope, that they, whiche they had sent to Athenes, shulde obteygne any thynge to theyr intente. So the sayde Ambassadours, that wente to Lacedemonye, dyd make marueylous dylygence for to perswade the Lacedemonyans to sende succoure vnto them of Mytilene. And in the meane time, came agayne the Messengers, that were gone vnto Athens. who hauynge made reaporte, that they coulde obteygne nothynge, the cytye and all the Ysle armed themselfe, for to resiste. Reserued Methymne, whiche toke part wyth the

Athenyan. And so dyd the Imbryans, the Lymnyens & some other of the Isles, being theyr next cōfederates. And hauyng made one assaulte vpon the campe of the Athenyans, though they had not had the worse, yet durste they not demoure nor abyde vpon the campe. Nother afterwardes they durste yssue fourthe, but they kepte themselfe wythin the cytye, attendynge and lokynge, yf anye succoure wolde come vnto them frome Peloponese or elleswhere. Certayne tyme after, arryued Meleas Laconyon,Meleas. and Hermeonidas Thebayne.Hermeonidas. Who thoughe they brought them no succoure, were dyspatched for to come towardes the Mytilenyens before theyr reuolte or rebellyon, for to empesche and lett the commynge of the Athenyans. But seynge that they had bene preuented, they caused themselfe to be brought pryuely vpon a Brygantyne into the towne, after the battaylle, that was made at the assaulte, whereof we haue spoken. And they counsaylled them of the towne, that they shulde sende with them some Ambassade vpō a lyght galley. Which they dyd. Seyng than the Athenyans, yt the Mytylenyens durst no more comme fourth, they toke the more courage, and cō
                  
                     •
                  maunded theyr allyes to comme and to strengthen theyr armye. Who came thyder wyllingly, thinkynge that wythoute greate payne they shulde ouercome the Lesbyens. And so they besieged the cytye on two sydes towardes the lande, and they fyrmed theyr two sieges wyth walles. And moreouer they dyd sett a greate garnysone wyth shyppes at the entrye of two portes, so that they of the towne coulde haue no vsage of the sea. But on the lande syde they dyd kepe all. For the Athenyans occupyed not but a very lytle about theyr campe, forsomuch as they had made, theyr estaple of victuayles, and the soiurne of theyr shyppes at Malee. In suche sorte were the affayres at Mytylene. In that selfe same saysone, the Athenyans sent aboute thyrty shyppes from Peloponese vnder the cō
                  ducte of Asopius, sonne of Phormyon, at the requeste of the Acarnanians. Who had prayed them that they would sende to that enterpryse some one of the children or of the parentes of the sayde Phormyo.Asopus The same Asopius wyth hys shyppes pyllaged and dyd fourrage many places by the sea syde in the countrey of Laconie, and after retyred vnto Naupacte wyth twelue of the sayde shyppes. And the other he sente agayne vnto theyr houses. Afterwardes, hauynge assembled all the puyssance of the Acarnanyans, he wente to make warre vpon the Ene
                     •
                  ades. And he by sea came to rushe vpon the shyppes of the Acheloyans. And the sayde Acarnanyens came by lande, to pyllage all the countrey. But seynge, yt he coulde not comme to the ende of hys enterpryse, he sente away hys armye by lande, and he wyth hys twelue shyppes toke hys course for to sayle into Leucadye. Neuertheles, beynge descended in Noricque, as he woulde haue retyred into hys shyppes, he was stayne, wyth one parte of hys souldyars, by the people of ye toune, with the ayde of certayne souldyours, that they had in very small nōber. And the other, after that they had recouered theyr deade of the Noricques,Nericū. and by thys meane confessed that they had had the victory, they retourned frōthence. In these entermedlynges, the Ambassadours, that the Mytylenians, had furste sente vnto the Lacedemonyans, hauynge by those Lacedemonians bene referred to the nexte assemble, that shulde be made of all Grece, in the place of Olympe, to thyntent that they beynge harde in the presence of all the confederates, the affayre shuld be determyned by common aduyse: they cōminge together at the tyme of the feaste, whan Dorycus Athenyan wonne the pryze, and after that the feaste and playes were acheued and ended, the confederates beynge assembled to consulte of theyr affayres generall, the Ambassadours were called, who dyd speake in thys manner.
            
            
               
               The proposition and speakinge of the Mytilenyens vnto the assemblye of the allyes and confederates of Grece. ☞The .ii. Chapter.
               WE do well vnderstande, Lordes Lacedemonyans and you other confederates, that it is accustomed amonge the Grekes (whiche is veray raysonable) that whan they wythdrawe in tyme of warre, anye, from the allyance of theyr ennemyes, vnto theyrs: they intreate thē very welle, so farre, as they serue for theyr proffyt. But afterwardes, consyderyng that they haue betrayed theyr furste and auncyent frendes, they repute them for to be vnhappy or naughty people, and thynke that they wolde do worser vnto them. whiche thynge were very raysonable, yf the thynges were egalle on the behalfe of them, that do rebelle, and on the behalfe of those, whom they forsake. For yf they be egall of force and preparatiō, as of wylle and amytie there is no reasonable cause whye they shulde habandone nor leaue the one, the other. But that hath no place betwene the Athenians and vs. The which thyng we wyll gladly declare, to the intente that youe esteme vs not for noughtye and wycked. And iudge, that we do dyssolutely and cowardely, yf we forsake them in tyme of warre, hauynge by thē bene honored in tyme of peace. For inasmuche as we come hytherfor to requyre to be receyued into your allyaūce, we woll gladly before all thynges both iustyfye our case & also do our vertue to be knowē. For yt that the amytye amonge the partycular people, and the confederatyon amonge the cytyes cannot be honnorable nor pardurable, yf there be not a mutuell opynyon of vertue on both partes. And in the reste, a coniunction and a conformitie of manners and of wylle. For where the wylles be dyscrepante and dysagreynge, the actes and operations be lykewyse. Wherfore to the intente that youe shulde vnderstande, howe we haue proceded with the Athenyans, we made allyaunce wyth them, whan youe departed frome the armys after the warres of Medes, & that they pursued the reste of the warre and of the ennemys. Whiche allyaunce we made not wyth them for to subdue the Grekes, but for to delyuer them frō the seruytude of the Medes. For thys cause, so longe as they contynued in good compaigny, we haue followed them with good and entier wylle. But whan we knewe that they hadde forgotten theyr enmyte agaynste the Medes, and that they wente aboute to reduce and brynge theyr compaignyons and allyes into theyr subiectyon: we were afrayde. Neuertheles for so muche, as it was not laufull nor an easye thynge to those confederates to reallye themselfe togeders, for to wythstande the vyolence, whiche the sayde Athenyans wolde do vnto them, for the multytude and dyuersyte of opynyons, that must be hadde in suche case: all the other confederates, excepte vs, and them of Chio, haue bene by the sayde Athenyans subdued and brought into theyr subiection & obeissance. And though that we haue sente of oure people to theyr assemblyes and commaundementes, as theyr allyes and confederates, and be takenne and named for suche, yet for truthe we neuer dyd take them for oure laufull dukes and headdes. For that it was not to be beleued, sythēs that they had reduced into seruytude the other, that were comprysed in the selfe allyaunce, that we haue wyth them: but that they wolde do the lyke vnto vs, whan they shulde see theyr oportunytie. For yf we had bene all yet in oure lybertye, we myght haue had more faythe in them. But hauynge subdued the more parte, it is to beleue, that they wolde take it

more dyspleasauntlye, that we woulde repute oure selfe egall to them in common affayres, and that we alone wolde accompanye our selfe wyth them, where all the other obeye them. Cōsydered chiefly, that howe muche they arne become more myghtye, we do remayne so muche the worse accompaignyed. Nother there is anye thynge that maketh so muche the allyaunce to be faythfull and pardurable, as doth the mutuell feare, that one of the allyes hath of the other. For he that wolde vyolate and breake it on hys partie, whan he consydereth yt the other is as puyssant as he, he feareth to assayle it. And that they haue permitted and suffred vs vnto thys presente to lyue in libertye, it hath not bene for any other reasonne, but for that they wente aboute to establyshe theyr princyyalitie, rather vnder couloure of some reasone and of counsaylle, than by manifest force. And also to the ende, that yf they made warre agaynste any of them (that they had subdued for any faulte, which they had done agaynste thē) they myghte iustifye them selfe, sayinge that yf the same warre had not bene reasonable, we and the other that were yet in lybertye, and hadde lyke auctorytie as they: wolde not haue gone thyder. For thys cause, they haue many tymes assembled a great puissance agaynste people, very weake. To thyntente, that hauynge by a lytle & lytle reduced the one after the other, they that remayned, shulde be so muche more weake. There, where yf they had begonne wyth vs (the other, stylle beynge in theyr entier and not subdewed) they coulde not haue done it so easelye. Also they wolde haue had some feare of oure shyppes, and wolde haue doubted, that y
                     •
                   we had assembled them all togeder, and wolde haue drawen vnto you or anye other, that it shulde haue bene to theyr dommayge. And on the other parte, we be saulfe from them by flaterynge and enterteygnynge theyr seigniorye by swete meanes. And so endure all theyr gouernementes vntyll thys presente. But yf that thys warre had not bene begonne, that coulde not longe haue endured, as it maye appeare by thexample of other. What amytye coulde thys than be, or what confydence coulde we haue had of true lybertye
                     •
                   where the one do gratefye the other agaynste theyr opynyon, to wytt, they by flatterynge vs in tyme of warre for feare that they haue to dysplease vs, & to prouoke oure anger: and we do the lyke to them in tyme of peace, for the selfe consyderatyon. And so yt, whiche amytie and beneuolence hath made stable and faythfull amonge other allyes: causeth feare betwene vs. And for effecte, we haue parseuered and contynued in thys allyaunce and socyete for feare, and not for loue. In suche manner that the same of vs, that sonnest had founde meane to breake it wythout feare of daungier, was readye to declare hymselfe, to be the furst. And yf any iudge vs, to haue done euyll to preuent and comme before, and that we shulde haue taryed vntyl they had declared theyr yll wylle, whiche we thought that they had had, consyderynge that yet they had not shewed it: he taketh it not welle. 
                     •
                  or that myght haue had apparaunce, yf we had had the facultye and power to espye and tarye our tourne, as they: and that in that case, there had bene no daunger to be vnder them, beynge as puyssant, as they be. But consydered that they had alwayes the meane and power to enterpryse vpon vs, whan they shulde haue wylled, it was reasonable that we shulde furste take it, whan we dyd see oportunyte. Thies be than the causes Lordes Lacedemonyans and confederates) for the whiche we depart our selues frō the Athenyās, which we thinke clere & raysonable to al mē, yt vnderstande thē, & sufficient on our behalfe for to put vs in dreade & feare. And to geue vs occasyon to seke some succoure. which thinge we had nowe determyned to do before the warre begāne, and for that cause dyd sende our messengers

towardes youe, for to demaunde youre allyance. But beynge by youe reiected & denyed, we coulde not obteygne nor execute it. Whereunto nowe hauynge bene moued by the Beotians, we haue done it readely and wythoute delaye. Persuadynge oure selues that oure reuolte and tournynge from them is iustyfyed by two great reasons. The one to the intente, yt not perseuering on the partye of the Athenyans, we shulde not be aydynge to subdue Grece, but rather wyth youe the other, we shuld helpe to defende hys lybertye: ye other, for to defēde our lyberty specyally, & that in tyme to comme, we be not subdued, as the other. And yet neuertheles we be declared to be to swyfte or to hasty. Wherfore it is nedefulle, that youe vse the more dylygence to succoure vs, and that youe shewe in effecte at thys poyncte, that youe wyll both defende thē, that youe oughte. & also that youe wylle noye youre ennemyes, in all sortes that youe can. whiche thynge to do, youe haue nowe greater oportunyte, than euer men had. For that, that the Athenyans be vnprouyded, of men, by meanes of the pestylence: and of monneye, by meanes of the warre. And also theyr shyppes be dysparsed, some of them into youre quarter of Peloponese, and the other into ours, for to watche vs. In such manner, that it is not to beleue, that they can rayse anye greate nomber, yf youe go to assayle them presently at begynnynge of thys sommer by sea
                     •
                   and by lāde. But rather it is to beleue, yt ayther youe shal
                     •
                  e more myghtye thā they by sea, or at the leaste that they cannot resiste youre puyssance ioynned wyth ours. And yf there be any that woll saye, that youe shulde not put youre lande in daunger, for to defende ours, that is farre frome you: I saye vnto youe, that the same mā, that estemeth the Isle of Lesbos to be farre of, shall knowe by effecte, that the proffyt, that he shall haue thereby, shalbe nyghe. For the warre shalbe made by thys meane not after the sorte that they thynke for. But it shalbe made in the place, from whence, Athens it selfe taketh & rayseth the monney and proffit. For theyr reuenues is taken vpon theyr allies. which yet wolbe greater, whā they shal haue brought vs to theyr subiectyon. For none of the other shall thā be bolde to rebell more agaynste them. And of the other parte oure goodes shalbe theyrs. And also we shalbe worse entreated than they, that haue bene before tyme subdued. But yf you succoure vs redely, ye shall haue in your power a cytye habundante wyth great shyppes, wherof youe haue nede. And also youe maye more easelye destroye the Athenyans, in retyrynge and wythdrawynge theyr allyes. For the other, by oure example, shall haue more audacytie to do the lyke. And also youe shall take awaye the euyll opynyon, that the people haue of youe, yt youe woll not receyue them, that come for to offre themselfe to youre allyance. Be abashedde than Lordes, to defraude & frustrate the hope, that the Grekes haue of youe, and also the religyon of the God Apollo. In whose temple we be here, as people that requyre mercy and franchyse. Receyue vs into youre allyaunce, and suffre vs not to be a praye vnto the Athenyans, to the partycular dangi
                     •
                  r of our parsones. For in receyuynge vs, shall followe the generall proffite of the leage of Grece. And yf you hahand one and forsake vs, there woll followe a dysaduauntage, yet more generall. Therfore shewe youre selfe, Lordes, suche men, as the Grekes esteme youe to be, & as oure necessyte requyreth. After that the Mytylenyens had thus spoken, the Lacedemonyans and the other allyes concluded to receyue them into theyr allyaunce. And those same Lacedemonyans, takyng the charge to entre agayne that same yeare into the lande of Athens, commaunded the other allyes, that they shulde be ready, assone ys they myght, for to fournys

               Thucidides. Of certayne great preparations and some smalle exploictes, that were done the same yeare, on the one syde and of the other. ☞The .iii. Chapter.
               IN ensuynge thys resolutyon taken at Olympe, the Lacedemonyās nyghe the dystreate of Peloponese, made theyr preparation of the fotemen, for to bestowe them in theyr shyppes. And afterwardes to cause them to assemble at Corynthe. And from thence to sende them by sea to the coste of Athens, for to assayle the Athenyans both by sea and by lande. And vsed greate dylygence to make theyr sayde preparations. But thallyes of the countreye, vsed greate neglygence, aswell for that, that they were occupyed to gather in theyr fruyctes, as also for that, that the warre beganne to noye them. Whan the Athenyans dyd vnderstande the preparatyons of the Peloponesyans, and that by that, they therin dyd, it semed, that they thought, that the puyssance of Thathenyans was greately debilitated and weakened: they armed an houndred shyppes, for to shewe that they were yet more puyssant than thennemyes dyd thynke. And that wythoute retyringe and callynge backe the armye by sea, that they had in Lesbos, they had shyppes and power ynough for to resiste them of Peloponese, yf they 
                     •
                  ame to assayle them. And within the said shyppes, they shypped all the cytezeins and inhabytantes of the towne, reserued the knyghtes and the pryncypall gouernours. Who, goynge agaynste the countrey of Peloponese, passed by before the destreate, to the intent that the ennemies myght see them. And also landed in the sayde countrey, where as they thought good. Whereby the Lacedemonyans that were in the same distreate, seynge the nombre of the shyppes muche more greate, than they dyd thinke: Imagyned that the Mytylenyans had fayned wyth them, wyth that, that they had sayde, and they thought that they hadde enterprysed to greate a matter, consydered, that the allyes dyd not comme. Wherefore, and vnderstandynge moreouer, that the shyppes of Thathenyans, yt were on the coste of Peloponese, dyd 
                     •
                  yllage the countrey aboute theyr cytye, they retourned vnto theyr houses. And after, they caused shyppes to be made fourthe, for to sende into Lesbos, and commaunded the confederates and allyes that they shulde furnyshe to the nombre of thyrty shyppes for the sayde voyage. whereof they gaue the conducte vnto Alcydas. On the other syde, the houndred shyppes of the Athenyans, whan they vnderstode that the Lacedemonyans were retyred, they retourned lykewyse. And ye same armye was the fayrest and the best appoincted, that the Athenyans had euer had. Althoughe that aboute the begynnynge of the warre, they had welle as greate nombre of shyppes or more. For they therein had one houndredde to defende Athens, Eubee and Salamyne, and they had asmanye that wente in and oute aboute Peloponese, besydes those, that they had at Potydee and in other places, whiche they kepte vpon the sea, durynge all one sommer. Also the expences of the same armye by sea, & the same that they made at Potidee, consumed greatly their money. For the men of marre yt defended Potidee, which were at begynning .iii. thousand (& so many were they, ye besieged it) & besides thē. ye .xvi. hoūdred, yt went wt Phormiō: had .ii. grotes of soulde euery mā by day, to wyt ye
                  
one for theyr lyuynge, and the other for the lyuynge of theyr seruaunte, and so muche all they hadde that were in the shyppes. In thys manner the A

                  henyans were furste at greate expences, and also prouyded of suche and so greate nomber of shyppes, at the self tyme, whan the Lacedemonyans were in the dystreate. The Mytylenyans, wyth certayne souldyars of theyr allies, made warre agaīst them of Mythymne, hopynge to haue it by treasone of some of the towne. But whan they had donne theyr beste on ye syde where they thought to haue theyr intellygence and purpose, and seynge that they were deceyued, they wente into Antysse,Antissa. into Pyre and into Eresse,Pyra. Eressus which cytyes they fortefyed in the beste manner that they coulde, aswell in repayrynge the walles, as otherwyse. Afterwardes they retourned wyth great dylygence to Mytylene. Soone after theyr departure, the Methymnyens came wyth theyr power agaynste Antysse, thinking to take it by force, but they were repoulsed by them of the towne and by certaine souldyars estraungers, that they had, wyth greate losse of theyr people, and retourned with shame. Of whiche thynges the Athenyans beynge aduertysed, and also howe yt the Mytylenyans dyd holde the Isle of Lesbos at theyr wylle, so that the people, that were at the siege, coulde not empesche them: they sente aboute the begynnynge of Autumpne, Paches,Pachetes. the sonne of Epicurus, wt a thousande men of theyr people. Who beyng enbarqued, they saylled vntill they were landed at Mytylene. Beynge at whiche place, they enclosed the cytye wyth a simple walle. And in many places therof, they sett vp towers in manner, as it were assieged aswell on the lande syde, as of the same of the sea very strayghtly. And so wynter drewe nyghe. But for so muche as the expences were very greate, and that the common monney nowe faylled the Athenyans, they beganne than (for to furnyshe the sayde siege) to set a taxe vpon them, vnto the somme of two hoū
                  dred talentes. And so they sent Lysicles,Lisicles and certayne other commyssaryes, with twelue shyppes towardes theyr, confederates, for to leuye on them a newe ayde. whiche Lysicles, hauynge exacted of many cytyes marytyme or nyghe the sea, a s

               ¶Howe the Athenians, that were assieged within Platee, and one parte of the cytezeyns, dyd salue themselfe by greate trauaylle and vertue, and passed all the walles, dyches, and fortes of the Peloponesyans, that kepte them assieged. ☞The .iiii. Chapter.
               IN the selfe wynter, the Plateans, beynge contynually assieged, & greatly oppressed by the Peloponesians, and by the Beotiens, and not hauynge any hope of succours of the Athenyans, nor to saue them selfe by other meane: aduysed wyth the Athenyans, that were in the toune assieged wyth them, to saue them al togeders ouer the walles of thennemyes, yf they myght do it by force of armes. Of the which enterpryse, the said Athenians were the inuentours, chiefly Theenetus,The
                        •
                     enetus. sonne of Timidas, whiche toke vpon hym to deu

                  e, and Eupoldyda,E
                        •
                     polpidas. sonne of Dymalchus. But for that, that it semed vnto them to be to dyffycyle and harde, the more halfe wythdrewe them selfe, so yt there remayned not, but about two houndred & twenty, yt dyd execute

yt in the manner as foloweth. They made ladders of the heigh of the sayd wall, whiche heith they toke by seing & calculatinge the greatnes and thyckenes of the brickes, wherwt the walle was made. nombrynge the rankes thereof, frome the toppe to the bottome, whiche thinge they mighte easely do by succession of tyme, there, where the walle was vncouered on their side. And likewyse they did calcuculate that whiche might transcende and be ouer the ioynters or byndinge togiders of the sayd bricques. And forsomuche as in that poinct one only man might well faille, many enterprysed to do yt at sundry tymes. In suche sorte that they made their ladders of that same highnes. Nowe the sayde walle was double, to wytte, the one towardes the towne to kepe them that they shulde not issue out, and the other towarde the felde to defende, that the succours of the Athenyans shulde not therinto enter, Distant the space of .xvi. foote, the one from the othere. wherein bitwene bothe were the lodginges and sheddes of them that kepte yt, separated the one from the other, but so thicke and so nighe, that the two walles semed to be but one, resarued that they had creueaulx all alonge, and from tenne into tenne Creuaulx, there was a greate tower, whiche helde the one walle wyth the other, so that one coulde not passe bitwene the walles, but through the midof the sayd towers, wherein, they that kepte watche in the night, withdrewe thē
                  self, whan yt raigned or was fowle wether. For that they were there couered, and also they were not farre from the Creueux or Looupe hooles. Than they of the towne, knowinge the manner of the watche, espied a night whan it greately did rayne and blow, and that there was no moone shyne. And vnder the conduict of those same, that had bene inuentours of thenterprise, they passed furst the dyche that was on their syde, and came vnto the foote of the walle, without being parceyued of the ennemys, by rayson that the obsturite and darkenes of the nighte did lett them to see, and the noyse or brute of the wynde and rayne, to heare. Also they went alonge, and separated the one from the other, that their harnois shuld make no noyse by touchinge togither. And also they were light armed, and they had but the lefte foote hoased for to kepe them frō sticking in the mudde. Nowe whan they had raysed vp their ladders againste the Creueux, where they parceyued that no body was, they that had broughte those ladders did furste clyme vp. After, a dousenne other did amounte armed onely of their bodys wyth harnnes and with a dagger in their hande. Of the whiche .xii. the furst and the chiefe was Amneas,Amnea. sonne of Corebus. And sixe of the said .xii. that came after hym, amounted to the toppe of the two towers, bitwene the whiche, were the Creueux right against ye ladders, that were raired vp. After thies twelue, other did amoūte being armed as aforesaid, and did moreouer cary with them, dartes fastened behinde their backes, that they shuld not empesche, nor hynder them to clyme vp. Some other, caryed after them, targats or shildes to delyuer them, whan they shulde be wyth thennemys hande to hande. But after that many were moūted vp, they that watchedde within the towers parceyued them, by meanes that one of the Plateans in skailinge, did caste downe a tyle from one of the Creuesses, wt the noise whereof, the watche did crye. At whiche their cry, the campe was so afrayed, that they came all to the walle not knowynge what it was, by meanes of the night, or of the fowle whether. And on the other syde, the Plateans that remayned in the towne, issued fourth and came to assaulte the walle, in othere places, clene cōtrary to the other where they skailed, for to deceyue thennnemys, in such manner, that they were all abashed what it mighte be, and did not remoue themself. Also they that watched within the towrs dust not issue fourth, studying and debatinge amongeste themselfe what it might be. Yet the thre houndredde

that had the charge to succour the watche, did light fyer on the coste of Thebes for to signefie the cōming of thēnemis. But they that remayned within ye towne, preuētinge ye same, did likewyse light a great quātitie therof vpō their wal, which they had prepared to the ende, that thennemys shuld not knowe, wherfore thyes fyers were made. And that their compaignyons might by this meane saue thē
                  self bifore that any succour came vnto the watche. Duringe this tyme they that were furst mounted, dyd winne the two towers and did kille thē, that they foūde within, for to kepe them, to thintēt that none of thēnemys shuld not come there. afterwardes they caused the other to amounte, whiche yet were not mounted, & so repoulsed with strokes of dartes, and of stones, them, that came to succour the walle, aswell by lowe as at the toppe. By meane whereof, they that were not yet amounted had leasure and occasion to rayre vp a greater nōber of ladders. And moreouer they that had gaigned and gotten the height of the walle, didde beate downe the Creuesses withinfourth, to thintent that they, that mounted, mighte more easely leape vp. And euery of them after that they were aboue, did cast stones and other dartes againste thennemys, that came vpon the dyche side on the outside, for to succour their people, that were vpon the walle. In suche manner, that all they, that shulde passe fourth, did amounte. though that the laste hadde therin greate payne. Afterwardes they all went downe from the towers to the dyche wythoutfourth, where they founde on the othere syde the three houndred that had charge to succour the watche, & that had lighted the bekens. By meane wherof they were in playne sight, by light of ye sayd bekens, & also it did let thē to see the other that were on the other syde: wherupon beinge by occasion hereof in faire sight, and also that they were vpon the syde of the diche in discouert: they yt were wtin, did repoulse thē wt force of dartes & so did hurt many. Thus they all did passe ye diche, though wt greate difficultie, for that the water was halfe frosen so yt ther were great flakes of Isse. And also it coulde not beare thē, & that was by meane of the south wynde that had thawed it. It rayned also, by reason wherof, the water was so increased that it came in a manner vnto their chynne. And they pourpously had chosen y• same tyme. After that they had passed ye dyche, lockyng or ioygninge thēself togiders, they toke the way, that leadeth to Thebes, leauing on the side of the right hande the sepulcre of Andocratus. And this they dyd, consideringe that the Peloponesians wolde neuer thinke that they wolde take that same way, that did leade vnto their ennemys, and also for that they did see that the said Peloponesians had lighte wyth fyers and beakens, all full vpō the way towardes Athens. But after yt they had gone sixe or seuē stades towardes Thebes they lefte that way, and toke on the syde the way, that goithe to the mountaigne of Erithre and of Nysie, and throughe that countrey of moūtaignes, they came vnto Athenes and were two houndredde and twelue in all. For the other, seinge the difficultie, retyred into the towne of Platee, excepte one, that was slayn in the dyche. The Peloponesyans, after that the bruyt was paste, retyred euery one vnto his lodginge in the campe. And as touchinge them of the towne, they knewe not if their compaignyons were in saulftie, or not. And for that, that they of their bende that were retourned, had saied that they were all deade, they sente whan yt was daye, their Heraulte towardes them of the siege for to haue the deade bodys, but vnderstandinge that they were saulfe, they made no furthere poursute. In this manner, parte of them, that were within the towne of Platee, did passe all the fortes and rampares of the ennemyes, and saued themselues.
            
            
               
               How the Mytilenians for fault of not being succoured in time, as the Pelopooesians had promysed, did render themself to the Athenians. and ye determynation that was made by those Athenyans to kylle them all togider, with certaine other thinges, that were done in the same tyme, by the people of the one partie and of the other. ☞The .v. Chapter.
               ABoute the ende of that same wynter, the Lacedemonyans did send in a light galley one Salethus vnto Mytylene.Salethus. who beinge landed at Pyreus, came a fote well nighe vnto the campe. and entred by nyght into the towne through ye shallowe of a streame, which passed ouerthwart the rampers of thennemys, wherof he was aduertysed. And he did signefie vnto the princypaleste and chiefest of the towne, that he was comme to aduertise them, howe the Lacedemonyans and other confederates shulde shortly enter in armes into the lande of Athens, and to sende them foorty shippes to their succours, as it was ordeynedde, and moreouer to prouyde in the meane tyme with thē in that, that was to be done in the cytie. By meane whereof, the Mytilenyās were slacke or retarded to make any appoinctement with the Athenyans. And so passed the fourth yeare of this warre. In the beginning of the sommer following the Peloponesians, sendinge Alcidas their Capytayne general by sea wyth forty shippes for to succour the Mytylenyans,Alcidas. they, wyth their confederates, entred a freshe into the lande of Athens, to thintent, that Thathenyans, seinge themselfe assayled and thronged on both sides, shulde haue lesse occasion to sende renforte or newe strength by sea to the siege of Mytylene. And of that army by land, Cleomenes was chief,Cleomenes. in the name and as tutor of Pausantas sonne of Plistenactus, hys yonger brother in years, than kyng of the Lacedemonyans. In whiche cō
                  myng, they destroyed afressh y•, that was encreased agayn & newly spronge in the countreys that they had wasted, the yeares preceadinge. And moreouer all the quartiers, where they neuer had touched bifore. By meanes whereof the same entry was more greuous to the Athenyans, than all the other bifore, excepte the seconde. For somuche as the ennemys, attendinge newes, that their armye by sea had done some greate exploicte in the Isle of Lesbos, where they thought it was than arryued, they dydde pillage and destroye alle, asmuche, as they founde before them. But vnderstanding afterwardes, that their enterprise of Lesbos failled, hauinge also lacke of victuailes, they retourned euery one into his quartier. In this meane tyme, the Mytileniens, seing that ye succours of the Peloponesiās came not, and that the victuailes failed them, they were constrayned to take appoinctement with the Athenians. wherof Salethus himself was the cause. who lokinge no more for the said succours, caused the armure to be delyuered to the people of the towne, whyche had not yet bifore borne them. to the intent to cause them to issue fourthe vpon Thathenyans. And whan they had receyued the armure, they wolde no lenger obey the officers, but they made greate assemblies & came to the gouernours and riche people of the towne, sayinge, that they would that all the goodes and victuailes shulde be putt in commone and parted by the hedde, and that if they so dyd nott, they wolde delyuer the towne vnto the Athenyans. whych sene by the said gouernours, and principallest: and fearing that the comon people shulde make an appoinctement a parte, withoute includinge them therin (whiche thinge they might do at their will for that they were the strōger)

they made all togiders their appoinctement wyth Paches and the Athenyans. vpon this condition that they shulde receyue tharmye into the cytie, and sende their Ambassadours vnto the Athenyās, to requyre grace, cōmyttinge into their wille and discretion the satisfaction and amendes, that those Mytylenyēs had to make for their offence. And this during, & vntill thaunswere were comme from Athens, it shulde not be laufull to the said Paches to kylle, bynde nor take prysonner, any of the Citezeins. whiche appoinctement notwithstandinge, they that had bene the principallest conductours of the reuolte or rebellyon, after that the hoste was entred into the towne, they withdrew themselfe into the temples for franchise & sanctuary. whome Paches did finde a manner to cause to cōme fromthence and sent them into the Isle of Tenedon, vntill that he had thaunswere frō Athenes. And after, he sente a certayne nomber of galleis vnto Antisse, whiche rē
                  dred itselfe vnto his wylle. And further he ordened touchinge the hooste, as he thought good. In thies entrefa

                  ctes, the forty ships with the Peloponesians, that shuld come to the succours of the said Mytyleniens, kepte thēself longe in secret about Peloponese, & also vsed very small diligēce. Yet they arryued at Delos before that the Athenyans parceyued them, & fromthence they came to Clarus & to Myconus,
                     Clarus.
                     Myconus.
                   where they furst did vnderstand that the towne of Mytylene was rendred and geuenne ouer, and yet neuerthelas the better to know the trouth of the matter, they came vnto Embatus,Embatus. in the countreie of Erythreus. Beinge in which place, and vnderstāding for trouth that it was than .vii. dayes passed sens the said cytie of Mytylene rendred itself, they helde counsaill amonge themselfe for to determyne what they had to do. wherupō Teuciaplus y• Helyē,Thespe kinge of Te

Alcide & youe other my compaignions and collegues, whiche be here Capytaines of this armye for the Peloponesians, this is my aduyse, that we go straighte to Mytylene bifore that the Athenyans be aduertysed of oure commynge. For it is to bileue that we shall fynde many thynges yll warded and kepte, as it comonly chaunceth in a towne newly takenne, and specially on the sea side, wherby they doubted not that anye succours shulde comme, and we be very stronge. It is also to beleue that their souldyars be disparsed and ronne out of order throughe the lodginges, as men haue accustomed, whan they haue the victorie. wherfore I thinke and haue good hope that if we go to lande there by night, & assayle thē soubdainly, wyth the ayde of thē of the towne (if there be any that be affectioned to our partie) we shall haue honnour of oure enterpryse. And we oughte not to feare the daungier. But oughte to remember that, that is comonly said of the feates of warre, whyche ys that they be varyable. There ys no other matter, but by those meanes, as I do shewe youe. For if the Capytaine do kepe hym self at his defence, and espieth his ennemye and canne assaylle hym wt his aduauntaige, he commeth oftentymes to the beste of his enterpryses. Thus didde speake Teuciaplus. But yet neuerthelas, he coulde not drawe Alcidus to his opynyon. Some other bannished from Ionū and from Lesbos, which were in that armye, shewedde the sayde Alcidus, that sithens he feared the daunger to goo to Mytylene, he shulde go to take one of the Cyties of Ionum, orelles the cytie of Cumes in the countreye of Eolide,Cuma from whence they mighte goo and cause the Ionyans to rebelle agaynste the Athenyans, for they thoughte, that they shulde goo into none place, where they shulde not be receyuedde at theire wylle and plesure. And by thys meanes, that they shulde take fro the Athenyans a greate revenue, that they leuyed vpon that countrey, and also shulde reco
                     •
                  er vnto them, that, whiche shulde be sufficient for to enterteigne and paye their armye, if they taryed there any tyme. And also they sayed, that they had esperance, ye
                  
Pissuthnes wolde tourne to their parte.Pissuthne. But Alcidus was not of this opynyon, nor yet of the othere bifore. And vnto his, the gretest parte of them, that were in that same counsaille, did agre. whiche was, that sithens they had faylled of the enterprise at Mytilene they shulde wythoute longer taryinge, retourne into their countrey. whiche thinge they did. Beinge than departed from the porte of Embatus, they came to arryue at the Isle of Myonesus,Myonesus. whiche is bilonginge to the Teyens. At whiche place he caused to be slayne manye prysonners that he had taken in that same sayling on the sea. By reasone wherof, whan he was arryued at Ephesus, the Ambassadours of the Enyens,Ene. that be in ye Isle of Samos, came vnto hym, and shewed him that the lybertie of Grece was not well maigteigned to kille them, that were not ennemys, and had not taken armure against them, but were allyed onely with the Athenyans through necessitie. And that if he contynued so to do, he shulde neuer withdrawe the confederates frome the Athenyans to the allyance of the Peloponesians, but rather their frendes wold bicome their ennemys. Throughe whiche declaration, Alcidus gaue lycence to many prysonners, that he yet had of Chio and of other places, whyche he hadde takenne ryghte easely and wythout resistence. For that, that whan they didde see the shippes vpon the sea, they fledde not awaye bifore them, but came towardes them, thinkinge that they had bene Athenyans. For they neuer thought that the Athenyans kepinge the sea, the shippes of the Peloponesians euer durste passe Ionū. After that, Alcidus departed in haste, and as flyinge frome Ephesus. For he was aduertised, that he, yet beinge at ancre at Clarus, was sene and discouered by two ships comminge from Athenes. To wyt, by that same of Salamyne and by that other of Parale.Parala. wherfore, fearynge to be pursued by the armye of sea of the Athenyans, he went into the depthe of the sea, to the intente not to approche to any lande with his good wille, vntill he arryued in Peloponese. Herof were aduertised Paches and the Athenyans on all sides. And specially, by one certayne messenger, that was sente by them of Ethreus. For the cytes of Ionū, that were not closed with walles, were in greate feare that the armye by sea of the Peloponesians, passynge a longe their countrey, though they were not willinge to arrest or tary there, that yet they wold lande for to pillage the townes, that they founde in their waye. Likewyse the ship of Salamyne and that same of Parale affyrmed to haue sene the armye of thennemyes at Clarus. For thys cause, Paches sayled for to pursue Alcidus, and followed him with the greateste diligence, that he might vnto the Isle of Latmos.Latmos. But seinge that there was no hope to tary him there, he retourned backe. And he thoughte that he had gott on inoughe that he founde them not in the meane sea, for than he shulde haue bene forcedde to haue assaulted them, and to kepe great watche ouer them. And in retourning, he wente vnto the cytie of Notion in the countrey of the Colophoniens by this occasion.Notion. The Colophoniens holdinge that same cytie, Itamenes and certayne strangers wyth him,Itamenes. had by meanes of one debate that was amonge the Citezeins occupyed the fortres of the towne, whiche was in fourme of one Castelle, separated from the walles of thother body of the towne. And afterwards, about that same tyme, that the Peloponesians was last entred into the countrey of Athens a great noise was afreshe moued, betwene them, that were comme newly to inhabitt in the cytie, and the auncyent Cytezeins. Through occasion wherof, they that kepte the towne forte
                     •
                  ied themselfe vpon the walles, that departed the towne from the castelle, and hauinge with them souldyars estraungers, whiche Pissuthnes and the Acardyans had sent them, they accorded with thē that were in the Castell. holding the partie of the Medes, in māner, that all togither shuld

gouerne the estate of the towne, and the other, that wolde not holde that partie, they fledde out of the cytie and sent vnto Paches
                     •
                   requirynge of him succours. who, beinge arryued bifore the towne caused Hippias to be called vnto him, who was capytaine of them that kepte the castelle, that he shuld come to speake with him vpon suche suertie, that if he woulde not do that, whiche the sayde Paches shulde wille hym, he wolde sende hym ayaine hoole and saulfe wythin the walle. like as he dyd. But whan that he was aryued bifore him, he caused him incontinently to be warded and kepte wythout byndinge or chayninge him otherwyse. Afterwarde right soubdainely he caused his people to marche againste the walles and rampares of the fort, where the Acardyans and the strangers were. who doubted nothing. And soo they were taken by the assaulte, and all putt to death. After he caused Hippyas to be brought within the towne,Hippias wythout doyng hym hurte. But whan he was wythin, he caused hym to be slayne wyth arrowes, and rendered the cytie to the Colophonyens, they beinge put fourthe, that had taken parte wt the Medes. Afterwardes, Thathenyans that were founders of that same cytie, caused all the Colophonyans that were founde in their obeyssance to assemble themself togither. And sent them to inhabitte there accordinge and ensuing their lawes. At departure from Notiō, Paches retourned vnto Mytylene, & brought agayne to the obeissance of the Athenyans, the cyties of Pyreus and Eresse. And found Salethus, who had hydde himself in the towne of Mytylene. And sent him to the Athenians wyth the Mytylenyās, that he had sent to Thenedon, with all the other, that he coulde vnderstand to haue bene the authors of the rebellyon. Afterwardes he sente away the greatest parte of his armye, that he had brought thider, and with the reste taryed there to geue order to the cytie of Mytilene, and to all the Isle of Lesbos. whan they, that Paches had sente, were arryued at Athens, the Athenyans caused Salethus incontinētly to dye, though that he promysed to do many thynges. And amonge other, that the siege whiche the Peloponesyans did holde yet bifore Platee, shulde be raysed. For the othere prysonners, the matter beinge put in deliberation of the counsaille, yt was with greate anger determined to cause to dye not onely thē that were thider brought, but also all the Mytylenyens, excepte the wemen and childrene, frome foortene yeares downewarde, whiche shuld be sklaues and bonde men. For they estemed the faulte of the sayd Mytylenyans, to be inremissible and not to be forgeuenne. For that that they rebelled, though that they were not entreated as subiectes, as the other were. And yet they had greater despyte, for that the shippes of the Peloponesians had had the audacytie for to comme to succoure the sayd Mytylenyans, to passe the sea Ionum with greater daunger. whiche was a tokenne that the sayd Mytylenyens hadde pourposed, and by longe circumstance prouyded afore, for that same rebellyon. So they dispatched a galley to signefy to Paches the decree of the Senate, of Athenes, and to commaunde him to execute yt. Yet the morowe after, they abhorred and repented themselues, consydering the crueltie of the decree. And they thoughte it to haynous to destroy and kylle all the people of a cytie, and not to extinquishe them, that had bene authors of the euill of other. whiche thinge, beinge knowin by thambassadours of the Mytylenyēs and by the Athenyans that fauoured them, they wente with all diligence to the chiefeste of the cytie, and wyth greate wepinges and lamentacions, perswadedde them gentely to putt the matter ones agayne into deliberation. For those principalleste were well aduertysed, that the moost parte of the people desired that it might be spokenne of agayne. So they caused the counsaill to assemble, whereat were spokenne many opynyons, but amonge othere (Cleon,Cleon. sonne of Cleuntus

whose opynyon was cōsented to the day bifore. That all the Mytylenyās shuld dye) a man roughe and vyolent and that had greate authorytie amonge the people, did speake in this manner.
            
            
               ¶The narration and proposition of Cleon vnto the counsaille of the Athenyans. ☞The .vi. Chapter.
               I Haue of tētymes knowin, that the meane estate ought not to rule. But yet I haue knowin more in their variation. whiche I wylle shew you in thys matter of the Mytylenyans. For yone thinke, that oure allyes goo as frankely and withoute deceite in busynes towardes youe, as youe go towardes them. And ye parceyue not, that the faultes that youe commytt, do suffre youe to be seduced by their speakynges and persuations, orelles by greate pytie doo putte youe in daunger. And also youe gette not, for all that, their good wylle. And ye consyder not that the empyre, that youe haue, ys but veray tyrannye, and that they that obeye youe, doo yt againste their wylle, and also they wolle not be longer obedyente, for that youe pardonne the taultes that they haue donne againste youe. And that your force and the feare that they haue of youe, do make them obeissant, and not the goodnes and mercy that you vse towardes them. But the woorste that I see in oure affayre ys thys, that in matters determynedde and concludedde, there ys no fyrmenes nor stabilitie. And we vnderstande not, that there ys better gouernemente in a cytie that vseth his lawes fyrmely and wythoute reuocation (yea though they be euyll) than in that same, that hath good lawes and doth not kepe them inuiolablie. And that ignorance wyth sobrenes and grauitie is more woorth, than knowlaige wyth inconstancy and rashenes. And that the people, that be somwhat grosse & more slacke of vnderstandinge, doo admynistre well and conducte better an estate, thā they that be more hable and sharper wytted. For thies woll alwayes be wyser than the lawes, and shewe in all matters, wherof ys questiō, by force of eloquēce and of well speakynge, that they knowe more, than the othere. knowinge that in no othere matter they canne somuche shewe the excellency of their wy

                  te, as in those that be of greate importance. whereby many inconueniences haue oftentymes chaunced to cyties. where as they, that truste not somuch to their knowlaige, woll not be wyler than the lawe, and also knowinge that they be not eloquente ynough to aunswere, & to sturre to all reasons with fayre wordes: study more to iudge by reasone, and to come to the effecte, than to debate the matters by argumentes & cōmunication. wherby matters haue bene the better gouerned for the more part. In this manner it is cōuenyent lordes not trusting in our eloquēce & habilitie, not to perswade our people otherwyse, than we know for the trouthe. And as for myselfe, I am in the same opynyon, touchinge this matter, as I was yesterdaye. And I am abashedde of theyme, that haue causedde thys matter to be putt agayne into deliberation, and by this meane suffre the tyme to be loste and ronne to the proffitte of them, that haue offendedde youe, and not to yours. For in delayinge of the punishemente, he that hathe receyuedde the offence, dothe aswage hys anger, and ys not afterwardes so sharpe to reuenge yt.

And will parforce themself to shewe, that the iniuryes and offenses of the Mytylenyens, be proftita table vnto vs, and that oure welthe redoundeth to the Calamytie of our allyes. For certaynely, whosoeuer wylle maigntaigne that, shall shewe openly, aither y• he wylle (for the great confydence that he hath in his wyttes and in his speache) cause other to bileue, that they vnderstande not the thinges, that be clere and manifeste: or ells that by meane of some corruption, he wyll deceyue youe by his eloquence and fayre speache. By suche meanes and dilations the cytie doth proffitt other, but she putteth herself in daunger. wherof you the other are the cause, that naughtely introduced and brought in, thies disputations, and haue bene accustomed to be regarders of woordes and harkeners of dedes, persuadinge your selfe, that the matters must chaunce, like as he perswadeth youe, that speaketh beste. And youe holde for more certayne that, whiche youe heare spokenne, than that you haue sene. For you suffre yourself to be led & deceiued by artificial speakings. And likewise you ar easy to be deceyued by newe wordes, & harde to execute y•, whiche hath bene ones approued & concluded. And by this meane, you arne subiectes to vayne thinges, and tary to longe in your auncyente customes. By meanes wherof, euery of youe parforceth himself and studieth to knowe to preache well. And those that haue not this eloquence, woll followe them that haue it, for to shewe, that they vnderstande no lesse the matters, than they. And moreouer if there be any one that speaketh any thinge subtill and apparante, youe ar ready to prayse hym, and to saye, that youe hadde thoughte asmuche, bifore that he hadde spokenne yt. where youe be slowe and nyce to prouyde for thinges, that myghte chaunce in that, whereof is spokenne. Serchinge by a manner to speake an othere thynge than that, whereof ye intreate. and vnderstande not sufficiently the matters presente. Suffrynge youreselues to be deceyued throughe the volupte and delectation of youre eares, as they do, that amuse themselfe sonner to heare the sophistes and logycyans to dispute, than to heare speake of the affaires of the cytie. Frome whyche erroure, I wyll take payne to wythdrawe youe, in causinge it to appere vnto youe, that the cytie of Mytylene is that same, that hath done youe a singuler oultrage and displeasure. For if there be any cytie, that for that he coulde not endure your Empire, or that were constraynedde by your ennemys, that doeth rebelle agaynste youe, I am of opynyon that yt shulde be pardonned. But if they, that holde an Isle and a cytie very stronge wyth walles, whyche fearethe nothynge but on the sea syde, and also maye well defende itself, hauynge good nomber of shippes tacledde, and that be not oure subiectes, (but be by vs honnored beyonde and aboue all oure confederates) haue done it: what maye a man iudge anye othere thinge, but that it ys a veray imagination against vs. And that yt maye be better saied that they haue moued warre, than to sayt

                   that they be rebelledde agaynste vs. For those maye be sayed to be rebelles, that were constraigned by any vyolence. And that, whyche more ys to be detestedde and abhorred, yt suffysed not them to make vs warre wyth theire owne force, but they haue attempted vtterly to destroye vs, by the meane of our mortall ennemys. wythoute hauinge feare, or consyderinge the greate calamytees that be chaunced vnto othere, that rebelled againste vs in tymes paste, after that we had reduced them to oure subiection. And also not fearynge to putt themselfe into newe daungers, where they were in reste and in greate felicytie. And the audacyte, that they haue hadde to enterpryse this warre, declareth that they haue

For thys cause, it had bene good for the Mytylenyans, that we hadde not more honnoured nor estemedde them, than oure othere allyes and confederates. For than, they shulde not haue fallen into so greate oultrecuidance and presumptyon. Also it is a naturall thyng to cont

of their eloquence in other matters of lesse importance, and not in thies, where the cytie (for a small delectation, that yt shall haue to heare faire speakinges & disputations) may incurre a great daunger. And yet shalbe neuerthelas reputed to haue spoken well. And as concernynge the vse of equitie and gentlenes, that shulde be done to them, whome we maye truste to be in tyme comminge, good and of a good wille. And not to them, whoe, after we shall haue pardonnedde them, shall contynue styll our ennemyes. And to conclude my speakinge in fewe woordes, if you woll bileue me, youe shall do to the Mytylenyans, that, whiche iustyce requireth. And that shalbe proffitable vnto youe. And if youe doo yt not, youe condempne yourself, and yet do not gratefie them. For if they here haue had iust cause for to rebelle, it must be confessed, that we rule vniustly. And though it so were, yet muste youe, sithens youe woll rule, take punishment of them here iniustly for your proffitt, orells departe yourself from your domynyon. And being eskaped the daunger, lyue as wyse men and iuste people. But if youe woll perseuer in your seigniory, ye muste recompense them accordinge to theire desarte. And make them to vnderstande, that youe haue the harte no lesse offended and pricked to reuenge you, being eskaped the daungere, than they haue had to sturre youe, and to conspyre agaynst youe. callynge to your remembrance, what youe haue to bileue of your selues. consyderynge what they woulde haue done vnto youe, if they mighte haue had the victorie. Specyally that they haue bigonne to offende youe. And they, that without cause do iniurie and offende other, do theire beste therin vnto the laste poincte, and go aboute to destroye them vtterly. Fearynge the daunger, wherin they shulde be, if they, that they offende, might eskape. Insomuch as euery man that parceyueth himself to be wronged by hym, that had no cause therto, if he may skape it, he reuēgeth himself more angrely against him, than he woulde do against his mortall ennemy. Be not than traytours vnto your self. But consyderinge the inconueniences that haue very nighe chaunced vnto you by this matter, euen as you haue aboue all things desired to take thies here: sens that youe haue taken them, render vnto them like punishemente And suffre not yourself somuche to relente and waxe gentle, for the estate and suertie wherin the thinges nowe be, that youe forget the wronges that haue bene done youe. But punishe well thies here, accordinge to their deserte, for to geue perpetuall example to other your allyes, that if there be any one, that rebelleth, it shal coste him his lyfe. For whan they shall knowe it, youe shall take no more payne to fight agaynst them, where youe ought to defende your frendes. Thus spake Cleon. After whome Dioditus sonne of Eucrates stode vp,Diodotus. who, at the consultacion the daye bifore, had chiefly spokenne agaynste them, that wolde that all the Mytylenians shulde be slayne, and did speake in the manner that followethe.
            
            
               ¶ The proposition and opynyon of Diodotus, contrary to that same of Cleon. ☞The .vii. Chapter.
               I Prayse not the opynyon of them, that reproue thys, that men putt agayne into deliberation the matter of Mytylene, and that thinke yt not good, that men consulte many tymes vpon waightie affaires. But me thinketh that there be two thynges much contrary to good connsaille. To wytt, hedynes or haste, and wrath or anger. For the one doth thinges

folishly, and the other furyously and rashly. And also me thinkethe, that he that wyll empesche and lett men to shewe thinges by woordes, ys wythoute vnderstandinge. Or that he hath some conceites and deuyses, that be not wel knowin. for if he thinke yt the things to come, which be not yet parceued, may be otherwise vnderstand than by wordes, he hath no vnderstandinge. And if he woll perswade any dishoneste and euill matter, & for that, that he thinketh, that he cannot make it good by woordes, wol astony and choke with iniuries and villenies those, that wyll saye the contrary, it is a great signe, that he affectith or fauoureth the matter. But yet they be more to blame that charge the againesayers, wt corruption. For if a man obiecte againste him, whose opynyon the greatest parte of the counsell haue not alowed, that he vnderstandeth not well the causes, he shalbe reputed onely ignorant, and not a noughty parsone. but whan it is obiected, that he is corrupted and brybed, though men allowe his opynyon, yet shall he be neuerthelas suspected. And if it be not holden, he shalbe not onely reputed ignoraunte but also an noughty parsone. whereby, the publique welthe shall susteigne dommaige, for that the people dare not speake nor counsaille freely for feare thereof. And it semeth, that it shuld be better for the wealthe of the comon weale, that there were no man in the cytie that had the vnderstandynge and knowlaige to speke wel, than yt there were any, as if by this, the people had lesse occasions to offende, whiche is hoole contrary. for a good cytezeine that speaketh his opynyon, ought not to empesche nor feare the other, that they shulde not speake againste hym, but in all equalytie and modestie shewe by reasone that hys opynyon is the better. And moreouer me thinketh that a cytie that gouerneth itselfe by reasonne, oughte not, nother to do more honnour to hym that counsaillethe welle aboue all the othere, nor yet lessen hym of that, whyche he hadde bifore. And likewyse shulde do no shame to hym, whose opynyon was not allowed, and yette lesse to punishe him. For by that meane, he, whose iudgement shalbe found good shall not care to saye any thynge, but that, whyche he thinkethe to sarue him to get the honnour or fauour of the people. And by lyke raysons he, whose opynyon ys not approuedde, shall not be moued to chaunge yt for to gratefye the multitude. wherin we do clene contrarye. For if there be anny that maye be charged to haue bene subournedde or brybed by gyfte or by promes, thoughe that he haue good opynyon and counsailleth the wealthe of the cytie: yet throughe suspytion of the sayd corruption (wherof there is none apparance) we wol reiecte and forsake yt. And whatsoeuer thynge he sayth, be yt good or euil, yt is suspected. wherfore it is necessarye that he, that wyll persuade any thinge to the comunaltie, aswell good as euyll, vse lyes and cautels, wherby it followith, that bicause of thies disguysings & chalenges, no man may proffytt him, that shuld speke of an open and manifeste matter, except he deceyue. For if any geue hym any thynge openly he shalbe suspectedde that he was wyllynge to gayne yt. whyche is not raisonne. For yt ys expedyente that we that be in this offyce, and that haue the charge for to delyberate and determyne greate and waightieste affayres, shulde parceyue further, than youe othere, that mynde not but thynges presente and at hande. Consyderedde specyally, that for that, whych, we saye, we muste shewe raysonne, where as youe that heare vs, do render no accompte of that youe heare. And if it were ordeynedde that he that heareth and suffreth himselfe to be perswaded, shuld be asmuch punyshedde, as he that speakethe and perswadethe, cetaynelye youe shulde iudge wyth the more modestie and more raysonne. But whan the matters be desperate vnto youe, youe punyshe throughe anger and wrathe, hym onely, that hath geuen the counsell, & not youe the other, yt haue followed it

And yet in that doinge youe trespasse asmuche, as he that hath spokenne yt. As touchinge me I intend not to speake in the fauour of Mytyleniens for to speake againste or for to accuse any parsonne. And if we be in our good wyttes, there resteth no questyō of their mysdede, but alonly, to consulte well for our selues. For albeit, that it appereth vnto vs that they haue trespassed, yet woll I not counsaille that they shalbe put to dethe, except it be expedyente for vs. And likewise, if they merytte to haue grace, I wolde not be of the opynyon that it shulde be extended vnto them, excepte it might be profytable vnto vs. And forsomuche, as oure consultation is more to haue regarde vnto the tyme to come, than to the tyme passed, & Cleon hath said that it is requisitt, for to wythstand the rebellyōs fromthesfourth to follow, that thies here shulde be punyshedde by death, I am of a contrary opynyō & that it shalbe better for vs to do otherwyse. And therfore I pray youe, that for the coloured raisons of this man here, proponed in his opynyon, for to enduce and perswade youe to follow it, that youe wil not to reiecte the vtilitie of myne. For I parceue well, that all hys reasons, beinge consonant to rigoure of iustice, they maye more moue youre hartes and thoughtes (whiche be nowe full of wrathe and anger) than myne. But it muste be considered, that we be not here for to debate iudicially with them, & for to knowe what reasone and ius
                     •
                  ice wyllethe, but we be for to aduyse amonge oureselues, what shalbe most to our proffite. Nowe youe knowe, that in many cyties, payne of life is ordeyned, not onely for so greate offenses, but also for muche lesser. And yet neuerthelas there are people that putt themself in daunger of that payne, trusting that they shall eskape yt. And there was neuer manne enterprysed suche pretenses and rebellyons, that thoughte not that he mighte acheue them. And there was neuer cytie that rebelled, that thoughte not to haue greater force and greater preparatyon, than yt hadde of itselfe, or of his frendes and allyes. But it is a naturall thing to men for to offend, and there was neuer law so rigoroux, that coulde let it. Although that newe paynes and punyshmentes haue dayly bene made & added for offenses, to see, if by feare therof, the people might be wtdrawin from trespassinge. And also it was not without reasone that in the begynnynge, the paynes were more lighte and easie, than they nowe be. Whiche, throughe the contynuall transgression of the people, bene in a manner at this presente all broughte to the extremest punishement. And yet notwithstādinge, we kepe not ourselues frō offending. wherfore there must aither be yet foūd some payn more fearefull, orelles this here, woll not kepe men from trespassinge. For to some, pouertie geueth audacite to do ill. some other, by meanes of their riches, bicome insolente, ambycyous and couetouse, and the other haue other passions and occasions, which sturre & induce thē to offende. And in effecte euery one is drawin by hys inclynation and disordered appetite, so v
                     •
                  hemently: that skarcely he may refrayne nor moderate himselfe for feare of any daunger, that may chaunce. There be on the other parte two thinges, whyche greately do hurte men, to wytt, hope and loue. wherof the one leadeth them, and the other accōpaigneth them. thone sercheth meanes for to execute their ymaginations, and the othere perswadethe the prosperitie of fortune. And though thies twoo thynges be not sene wyth the eye, yet they arne more puyssant, than the payne that is sene. There is yet an other thynge, whiche helpeth and serueth maruelously, to incyte and prouoke the affectyons and wyttes to wytt, fortune. which by representing some occasion vnloked for, although it be not sufficiente, bringethe oftymes the people into great daū
                  ger. And yet more the cyties, than the particuler parsonnes. Forsomuche, as there is questyō of greater thinges, to wyt, of lybertie or to encrease their empire.

And moreouer euery man, parceyuyng hym selfe to haue the confederatyon and compaigny of one people, hath greater hope of hym selfe. And for conclusyon it is a thynge impossyble and wythout raysone to thinke, that whan humayne nature is pricked and sturred by a vehement inclination to do any thynge, he canne be wythdrawen from it by force of lawes or by any other dyffyculte. Wherfore it is not mete, that we ordeyne payne of deathe for offenders, vpon confydence, y• that geueth securitie and assurance for tyme to comme. Also it is not mete, that we take frome them, that hereafter shall rebelle, hope of mercye, and lycence to repente them selfe, and to purge them incontynently of theyr mysdede. And that it maye be so, presuppose that there maye nowe be some other cytye, that maye be tourned agaynste youe, and that knoweth wel that it can not resiste you. But hath suffycyent, wherewith he maye satis
                     •
                  ye the expences, that we shall make to recouer it, and to paye vs the trybute for the tyme to comme, yf we take it by composytyon. And yf the same do vnderstande that there is no hope of marcye of youe to be had, woll it not prepare it selfe yet more strength to resiste youe & determyne to endure all extremyte of assiege, rather than to render and yelde yt selfe? Now than remēber, why der it be all one that a towne rendreth it self vnto youre wylle incontynentlye, or a very longe tyme after hys rebellyon. And what charge and what dommage it shalbe vnto vs, whan they shall forsake to be reduced to oure obeyssance, to haue them by length of siege, and yet whan we shal haue taken them, that we destroye them, and by that meane lose our reuenue, by meane wherof we shall be egall to oure ennemyes. Truly we ought not to procede here to the punyshment of offenses, as iudges to oure oune dommage, but we ought to remember for the tyme to comme, howe we maye drawe and recouer the reuenue and trybute of oure cytyes, in mulctynge them moderatly, and to kepe and conserue them, more by gentlenes and good intreatinge, than by rygoure of lawes. Whereunto we do nowe intende to do the clene contrary. For yf any people, that were franke and free, hath bene by force brought into our seruytude and subiectyon, and myndynge to recouer their lybertye do rebelle, as reasonably they maye do, and afterwardes hath bene recouered and brought agayne, youe woll that all seuerytye be vsed agaynste him. Certaynely I am of contrary opynyon, and thynke that the free people, that do rebell, shulde not be sharpelye punyshed, but be well kepte by good meanes, that they do not rebelle, and to intreate them in suche sorte, that they maye haue no occasyon to haue suche wille. And consyder moreouer what faulte youe shall commyt, in followynge the opynyon of Cleon. youe parceyue that the people, of all the confederate cyties, be affectyoned to youre estate, and that they tourne not to youre ennemies, although they be puyssante. Or yf any of the sayde cytyes do tourne frome youe, the comō people hateth them, that haue bene the cause therof. And wyth thys confydence of the loue of the people, youe go aboute to make your warre. Nowe yf you kyll all the people of Mytylene, whiche haue not consented vnto the rebellyon (but whan they myghte haue taken armure, and founde thēselfe most stronge, haue receyued you into theyr towne: furste you shalbe in greatefull and oultragious vnto them that haue well acquyted themselfe towardes youe, and afterwardes youe shall do that, that youre ennemyes desyre. For whan they shall haue drawen one cytye of ours vnto theyr partye, all the people shalbe theyrs. vnderstā
                  dynge, that yf they come into youre handes, asmuch shall they be punyshed that shall not haue offēded, as they that shall haue done the worste that they might. Where, thoughe they had offended, youe shulde haue dissymuled and wynked at it, to the intent that that, which we yet reteigne vnder the forme o
                     •
                   a fellowlike

lyuynge, shulde not be tourned into host ylytie and enmytie. And in my opynyon it shulde be more proffytable for vs, for the conseruatyon of oure empyre, to indure to be oultraged and iniuryed with our knowlaige, than to cause oure people to dye, whan it is not expedyent. Althoughe we myght do it by iustice. And it shall not be founde verytable and true that Cleon hath sayde, that one self vē
                  geaunce maye be bothe iniuste and proffytable. And sythens that ye perc
                     •
                  yue, that that, which I have spokenne is for the beste. I am of aduyse that wythout groundyng youe vpon any swetenes or benignyte (where vnto I woll not that ye haue regarde for the thynge that I perswaded youe but for the weale of the 
                     •
                  ytye onely) that ye kepe yet this people here, that Paches hath sent prysonners, for to ordeyne hereafter therevpon all at leasure. And touchynge the other, that youe suffre them, to inhabyte the cytye of Mytylene. For that shall serue youe in tyme to comme, and nowe feare youre ennemyes. Forsomuche as he, that geueth raysonable counsaylle, is more feared and more estemed of hys ennemyes, than he, that by a rashe crueltye dothe and commytteth insolente and oultragyous thynges. Thus spake Diodotus.
            
            
               Howe the citie of Mitilene was in daunger to be vtterlye destroyed, and the punyshment which it receyued for hys rebellyon. And howe the Plateans rendred them selfe to the wylle of the Lacedemonyans, wyth some other exploict of warre, that was done in that same yeare. ☞The .viii. Chapter.
               AFter these contrary opynyons, there were many altercatyons among the Athenyans, so that whan it came to geue theyr voyces, they were founde equall and parted, asmuche as thone syde, as on the other, but yet at the ende, that same of Diodotus was alowed. And so they dispatched incontinently one other galley for to go wyth all dylygence to Mytylene, doubtyng that yf she vsed not dyligence, the other, that was departed a daye and a nyght before thys, shulde preuente it. In suche manner, that whan thys last arryued, she shulde fynde nowe the cytye e
                     •
                  tinguished. For which feare thys latter galley was wayged and victuaylled by the Ambassadours Mytylenyens. Who made greate promyses to the maronners, yf they arryued soner, thā the furste. Which by thys meane, for to make extreme dylygence, ceased not daye nor nyght to sayle. And in theyr saylyng, they dyd eate theyr breade, sopped in wyne and in oyle, and also they slepte by course, so that the shyyp wente wythout cessynge. And it chaunced them so well, that they neuer had one onely contrarye wynde, which was a greate fortune. By meane whereof, ioynned also, that the f
                     •
                  rste, y• caryed the euyll newes, dyd not make very greate dylygence, that same galley arryued very sone after, that the other was aryued. And euen at the houre whan Paches redde the furst cōmaundement, & prepared hymself for to execute it, the later was presented, which empesched the executiō. In this manner the cytie of Mytylene was very nyghe to vtter destruction. And as touching thē, ye Paches had sente as chief offendours, which where more than a thousande, they were all iudged to deathe, according to ye opyniō of Cleon. And also ye walles of ye citie of Mytylene, were beatē doune, & all their shippes were takē frō thē, & moreouer there was no trybute imposed or set through al the Isle of Lesbos, but it was all (except the citie of Methymne) deuided into thre .M. partes. Whereof they

dyd geue and dedicate to the temples of the Goddes, thre houndred for ye tenth, and to other they sent of theyr cytezeins by Lott for to inhabyte there. And dyd ordeyne that the Lesbiens shulde paye them for euery of the sayde partyes, two pounde wayght of syluer. And for that some, they were permytted to labour the sayde lande. Moreouer ther was taken, from the sayde Mytylenyans, all the townes and landes that they had in the mayne lande. Which afterwarde remained in obedyence of the Athenyans. Suche was the yssue of the rebellion of Lesbos. In that same sōmer Nycyas sonne of Nyceratus wente by sea wyth a good bende of Athenyens into the Isle of Mynouer.Nycias M

                   Whiche is ryght agaynste and harde by Megare. And there was a castell, that the Megaryens dyd kepe for a forte, whiche Nicias mynded to take, for to haue there a defence and recourse more nyghe, than that, whiche they had at Budore and at Salamyne, and to the intent, that, whan the Peloponesyans shulde yssue into the sea, they shulde not hyde theyr galeys there, as the Corsaireens had many tymes done. And also to the ende, that the Megaryens shulde haue no more any meane to enter into the sea. And so he came furste, departynge from Niseus to sett hys shyppes before ye castelle. Wherof he dyd beate doune wyth artyllerye, two towers, which were higher than the dongeon of the sayd castell. And by thys meane he made, yt the shippes might passe wtoute daunger betwene the Isle and the sayde place of Nyseus.Nisea

                   And moreouer he made a walle ouerthwarte the dystreate, from the mayne lande that came to aunswere to the Isle nygh ynough vnto it. Through which men sente succoure to the sayde Castell, for that they were maryshes. And after that he had made hys rampares and munytyons, wythin a verye shorte tyme he lefte hys garnysons at the defense of the walle, and retourned wyth the remenaunt of hys people. In that same sommer, the Plateans, beynge in greate necessitie of victuayles, and seynge that they coulde not resiste the assaulte of the Peloponesyans, they made appoinctment with them. For also the Capytayne and Lieutenaunt of the Peloponesyans, beynge approched nyghe vnto the walle, and seynge that they were so feble that they coulde not defende themselfe, wolde not take them by assaulte, for that, that he was commaunded by the Lacedemonyans to take it by composytyon, rather than by assaulte, yf he myght. To the intente, that yf any appoinctment were made betwene the Peloponesyans and the Athenyans, by the whiche it shulde be ordeyned that the townes and cities that shulde haue bene taken by warre of the one syde and of the other, shulde be rendred: those Lacedemonians myght excuse themselfe, for none rendrynge of this, vnder coulour, that they gott it not by warre, but that it was rendred vnto thē with their good wille. And so he sente an haraulte vnto them, by whome he demaunded, whyder they wolde rēder the towne & the people that were wythin to be at the wylle of the Lacedemonyans, and commyt vnto theyr dyscretyon, the punyshement of them, that shulde be founde coulpable, so that none shulde be punyshed, but that furste hys cause shulde be knowen and iudged. Whiche thing they agrede vnto, seynge them selfe in suche extremytie, that they coulde no longer resiste. And by thys meane the Peloponesyans dyd take the cytye, and nouryshed the people that were wythin it wyth victuayles for certayne dayes, and vntyll ye fyue iudges which the Lacedemonians had sente for this matter, were there arryued. who wythoute makynge any other particuler proces, caused all them to assemble that were wythin the towne. Afterwardes they demaunded of of them onely, yf sence the warre begonne, they had in any thynge well merited towardes the Lacedemonyans and theyr allyes. To which demaunde they requyred that it myght be laufull for them to aunswere more amplye by comō
                  
delyberatyon. Which thynge was graunted them. And so they dyd chose Astimachus,Astimachus. sone of Asopolaus and Lacon,Lacon. sonne of Aimnestus,Aimnestus. who was burgeois of the Lacedemonyans, and they dyd speake in thys manner.
            
            
               The proposition and defence of the Plateans before the Lacedemonyans. ☞The .ix. Chapter.
               FOr the fayth and confydence, that we haue had in youe, Lordes Lacedemonyans, we haue commytted oure cytye and our parsones into youre power. Not lokynge, for suche iudgemente of youe, as we perceyue, that m

And specially we hoped, yt it shuld haue bene liefull for vs to dyspute & debate oure reasone & our cause. But we doubte greatly that we haue ben deceyued of both our thoughtes. For we feare & not wtout cause, that thys disceptacion & debatyng be vpon our lyfe. And that youe comme not to iudge of our case by reasone. Wherof we see an euydent tokenne, by thys, that there is no accusation proponed agaynst vs, wherin we maye defende vs. But at oure request, lycence is graunted vs to speake, and your interrogation hath bene very brief. Wherevnto, yf we wolde aunswere accordyng to the trouthe, oure aunswere shalbe contrarye and ennemye to oure cause. And yf we aunswere contrary to trouthe, it maye be condempned, as faulse.

For yf they, that be in suche case, speake not that they myght say, they haue alwayes the harte dyspleased, and they thy

Thys notwithstandynge, yet woll we parforce our selues, to shewe you the reasone and the ryght, that we haue agaynste the ennemitie of the Thebayns and agaynst you and the other Grekes, puttinge youe in remembraunce of oure seruyces and good dedes. And for to aunswere vnto the ryghte brief interrogacy
                     •
                  , yt is made vnto vs, whyder duryng thys warre we haue in any thing meryted well towardes the Lacedemonyans and theyr confederates, we aunswere youe, that yf you demaunde vs as ennemies, we haue done you no iniurie though we haue done you no pleasure. But yf you aske vs, as frendes, we thinke yt you haue more offēded vs, than we haue offēded youe. For that, yt we haue not begonne the warre, althoughe that we haue 
                     •
                  ot in any thynge yet broken peace wyth youe. And in tyme of the warre wyth the Medes, we alone of all the Beotyans came to assaulte the sayde Medes wt the other Grekes for to defende the

lybertye of Grece. And notwythstandynge that we were people of mayne lande, yet dyd we fyght with them nygh to Artenusus by sea. And afterwardes whan they dyd fyght in oure lande, we were there wyth Pausanias. And of all the other thynges, that were done by the Grekes in greate daunger, we were parttakers further than ower puyssance stretched. And in partyculer, to you other Lacedemonyans, youre cytye of Sparte, beynge in great drede and feare, after the earthequake, whan the bonde men dyd flye frome Ithomus, we dyd sende the thyrde parte of oure people to youre succoure. Of whiche saruices to haue none remembraunce, shulde be a thynge to dyffycyle. Suche were our workes in the begynnynge. And yf sence, we haue bene ennemyes, that hath bene through your defaulte. For whan we were inuaded by the Thebayns, perseuerynge in amytye and allyaunce, we had furst recours vnto youe, and youe repoulsed vs, saiynge that youe were to farre frome vs, and shewed vs that we shulde haue recourse to the Athenians, whiche were oure nyghe neyghbours. Lyke as neuer by warre youe suffred any oultrage, so arne youe not to suffre for vs. And yf we hadde not bene wyllynge to haue departed frome the Athenyans, yet had we not done you iniurye. For consydered, that they had ayded vs agaynste the Thebayns, there where it was not youre commodytye to do it, it had not bene honnestye for vs, to caste them vp and forsake them, seynge chiefly, that they at oure requeste had receyued vs into theyr allyaunce. And also we haue receyued greate benefittes of them, and they receyued vs as theyr burgeoses. Wherfore it was reasonable yt we shulde obey them wyth our power. And yf youe and they (whiche be dukes & capytains of youre partyes, haue done any euyll thynge) hauynge your allyes in your compaignie, the same ought not to be imputed to thē, that haue followed you, but to the Capytaynes, that haue conducted them to do it. And as touching the Thebayns, besydes many oultrages, that they had done before, they dyd cō
                  mytt the last agaynst vs, which hath bene cause of all these euylls, as youe do knowe. For they came in tyme of peace, vpon the daye of the solempne feaste, for to inuade our cytye. Wherby they receyued suche punyshment, as they deserued. Lyke as it was laufull for vs, and permytted by the commone lawe and generall saufgarde, vsed amonge all people. By whiche it is laufull for euery man to sley hym, that commeth to assaulte hym, as ennemye. Wherfore yf you woll punyshe vs for that cause, that shulde be agaynste all iustyce. And youe shulde declare youre selfe euyll iudges, yf that to make youre proffyte of them, because yt. they be youre allyes in thys warre, youe woll do iustice at theyr pleasure. And haue more regarde vnto youre proffyte, than to reasone. And howesoeuer that ye woll haue regarde vnto youre vtilitie, and consyder these here, to haue bene proffytable vnto youe in thys affayre, yet haue we bene muche more. And that not onelye vnto you, but to all Grece, whan that youe were in muche greater dangier. For at thys presente, youe haue bothe harte and puyssance for to assaulte the other, but than, the stranger kinge dyd laye the yoake of bondage to al the Grekes, hauynge these here on hys partye. Whereby, reason wolde well, that youe shulde laye to the contrary of thys our mysdede (yf there be anye thynge mysdone) the seruyce that oure cytezeins dyd for youe. And the affectyon yt they maye shewe vnto youe, whiche you shal fynde muche greater than the mysdede. And so muche the more, that at that same tyme there were few Grekes founde, that wolde put theyr vertue in daunger agaynste the forces of Xerxes. And they were hyghly praysed, who beynge assawlted a

                  d assieged, had no regarde to their welthe, not her to conserue theyr parsonnes and theyr goodes, but delyghted more wyth greate daunger to enterpryse thynges worthy of memorye, among

whome we were reputed and honnored as the principalleste. whereby we haue great feare to be destroyed and to perishe at this present, for hauynge wylled to do the lyke, to wyt, for followyng the Athenians iustly and according to rayson, rather than youe cautelously and by deceitte. And neuerthelas it is conueniente that one self iudgement be always geuen vpon one selfe cause. And not to place nor establishe proffytt in any other thinge, but only in fay the & loiaultie of frendes & allyes. For in knowing alwais their vertue, yt they haue shewed in thinges passed, you may establishe yours proffitablie, being present. Consider moreouer that a great parte of Grekes do at this presente day, esteme and repute youe to be the true example and the mirrour of vertue & wysdom. wherfore you ought well to feare to geue an wrongful sentence against vs. For in that doinge (which cannot be hydde) ye shall purchase great blame, hauinge determyned and iudged of vs, yt be good people, otherwyse than accordyng to reason. euen youe that arne reputed the beste, and to haue sett in your temples the spoiles of them, that haue so well meryted towardes all Grece. And also yt shalbe alwayes greately imputed vnto you, to haue at the appetite and pleasure of the Thebains, vtterly destroyed the cytie of Platee. The name wherof, and for greate honnour and in remembrance of his cytezeins: your fathers dyd graue at the aulter of Apollo Delphicus. For we arne come to suche calamyte and perplexitie, that if the Medes hadde vainquishedde, we hadde bene destroyed: and hauynge hadde the victorye agaynste theym, we be at this presente vainquished towardes youe, that be oure greate frendes, through the Thebains. And so we haue incurredde two extreme daungers and calamytes, to wytt, to dye for hunger than, in resistinge to yelde vs at the wyll of the straungers, and nowe to defende oure lyfe in iudgemente. And we that haue more hartely tendredde the honnour of Grece, than our force mighte susteigne, be habandonned, dispysed and for sakenne of all. And there ys not one onely of all the Grekes, that were than presente, oure allyes, that maye ayde vs. And specially we feare greatly, that you other lordes Lacedemonyans, in whome wee haue putte oure pryncipalle truste, be not stable and constante inough in thys matter. Therefore we praye you for the honnour and reuerence of the Goddes, whych were than fauourers of oure societie and fellishipp, and in remembrance of all the seruices and merittes towardes all the Grekes: that you wylle appease and mytigate youre hartes towardes vs. And if youe haue at the persuation of the Thebains, determyned any thynge agaynste vs, to reuoke yt. And the pleasure, that youe haue graunted them, to slaye vs all, repeale it for to saulue vs. In whiche doinge, youe shalle purchase an glorious and honnorable grace, in stede of an cruell naughtynes. And also yt shall not be youre shame, for to geue ioye and pleasure to an othere. For it is ryght easye for youe to slaye vs, but yt shalbe very harde afterwardes, to abolish the infamye, that youe shall incurre by that deede, for to slaye vs vniustely, that be your frendes, & not your ennemyes, but throughe necessitie. And in effecte, if you delyuer vs oute of the daunger and frome the feare wherin we be, youe shall iudge iustely. Forsomuche specially, as we be yeldedde wyllingely into your power, commynge vnto youe, oure handes holdenne vp (in whiche case the lawes of Grece defende that men shulde be slayne) and also that wee haue alwayes and at all tymes, desarued well towardes youe. And that yt so is, biholde in oure lande the tombes of your cytezeins, that were slayne by the Medes, whych be by vs honnored euery yeare openly. And that not onely wyth vulgare and comon honors, but wyth n

and some tyme accompaignedde too the warre. whereunto youe shall doo the hoole contrary through euill counsaille, if youe woll slaye vs. For youe oughte to consyder that Pausanias buryed them in this lande, as in the lande of frendes, and amonge his allyes. wherfore if youe slaye vs and geue our lande to the Thebayns, what other thinge shall youe do, but depryue vs, youre ancesters & parentes of the honnors that they haue, and leue them in the lande of theire ennemyes that haue slayne them? And moreouer bringe into seruytude that land, in the whiche the Grekes haue recoueredde their lybertie. And also you shall leue the temples of the goddes desart and not inhabyted, wherin they haue made the vowes, by vertue wherof, they haue vainquishedde the Medes. And youe shalle take the furste aulters from them, that haue founded and edified them. whiche shalbe certaynely (lordes Lacedemonyans) a thynge abatinge and farre inconuenyent vnto youre glory, to manners, and common lawes of Grece. For the memory of youre progenytours and oure saruyces and merytes
                     •
                   to haue slayne vs, wythoute beynge by vs offended, through the hatred of othere. And yt shulde be muche more conuenable for youe to pardone vs, and aswaginge your angre and displeasure, to suffre yourself to ouercome by a modestuous mercy. Consideringe and settinge bifore youre eyes, what euills youe shall do and to what sort of people. And that suche calamyttes do very often chaunce to people, that haue not deserued them. wherfore we praye you (lyke as bicommeth vs and as necessitie constrayneth vs) callynge to our aide the goddes of our particuler temples and those that be comon to all Grece: that youe vouchesaulfe to receue vs frendelye and to cease youre displeasure at oure requestes and declaratyons and haue remembraunce of youre auncesters. For whose memorye and sepulcres, we requyre youe, callynge theyme vnto oure ayde, euenne deade, as they be that you wyll not to putte vs into the subiectyon of the Thebayns, nor delyuer your ancyente frendes into the handes of youre naturall ennemys. Aduertysinge youe, that the selfe daye, wherein we were in daunger to suffre extreme euyll, ys that same onely, wherein we dydde so manye fayre actes wyth your ancestres. But forsomuche, as, to a people that be in suche myserye and necessytye as we bee, it ys a myserable thynge to make an ende of theire speakynge, thoughe that yt preuayleth nott to vse yt by necessytye, insomuche as afterwardes, whan they haue donne, they attende and looke for the extremytie of deathe: yet in ceasynge too speake, wee saye to youe, that we haue not rendredde oure cytie vnto the Thebayns. For rathere we woulde haue enduredde to dye by famyne, or by othere shamefull death. But it is to youe (lordes Lacedemonyans) for trouthe, to whome we be rendredde, puttynge oure truste in youre faythe. Wherefore if wee cannot obteygne oure requeste, reasonne wylle, that ye serte vs agayne in that state, wherin we were, to wytt, in daunger of that, which might chaunce vs, puttynge youe agayne in remembrance, that frome youre handes youe doo, not cōmytt into the same of the Thebayns, oure mortall ennemyes, vs the Plateens, whyche haue bene alwayes affectyonedde to all the Grekes and that haue rendredde themselfe vnder youre parte, and to youre mercye. Butt rathere to be authors of oure weale, to the ende that men may not say, that you that pretēde to putte all the Grekes in libertie, haue vtterlye abolyshedde and extinguishedde vs. In suche manner spake the Plateens. Than the Thebayns, fearynge lest the Lacedemonyans shulde be mouedde wyth their speakynge to graunte theyme somme thynge, demaundedde to be lykewyse hearde. For somuche, that in theire opynyonne, to muche audyence and too longe delaye was grauntedde

to the sayd Plateens for to aunswere to the interrogation, that was made vnto them. And after that lycence was grauntedde them to speake, they beganne in this manner.
            
            
               ¶The oration and speakinge of the Thebayns, agaynst the Plateens, and howe they were destroyed and slayne. ☞The .x. Chapter.
               WE hadde not requyred this audyence (lordes Lacedemoniens) if this people here, hadde aunsweredde briefly to the interrogation made vnto them, and if they hadde not tourned their talke agaynste vs by chargynge and blamynge vs, and excusynge themselfe wythoute purpose, where no manne accusedde them, and highly praysynge themselfe, where no man blamed them. But nowe we be constrayned partly to denye and partly to faulsefie that, whyche they haue sayde. To the ende that their oultrecuidance and presumptyon proffytte not them: and oure scilence and pacience hurte vs. And afterwardes youe shall iudge, who shall haue sayde the trouthe. And furst the cause of oure enmytie muste be consyderedde. whyche ys for that, that hauynge foundedde and peopled the cytie of Platee, the laste of all the othere, that be in oure contrey of Beoce, wyth certayne other townes, whych we had wonne oute of oure sayde countrey, and peopledde wyth oure people, chasinge fromthence those, that were there before: thies here onely frome the beginninge disdaigned to be vnder oure empyre, and woulde not obsarue ou
                     •
                  e lawes and ordinaunces, whyche all the othere Beotians did holde and kepe. And parceyuing, that we woulde constrayne them therunto, they rendred themselfe to the Athenyans. throughe whose helpe, they haue done vs very many dommages, wherof they haue bene well recompensed. But touchinge this, that they say, that whan the Medes entred into Grece, they onely, amonge all the Beotiens, woulde not take theire partie, whyche is the matter, whereof they aduaunte themselfe, and that they reproche vs the more: wee confesse truely that they did not take parte with the Medes, forsomuche, as the Athenians did not take it. But by the same reasonne we saye, that whan the Athenyans haue holden against al the Grekes, they onely amōge all the Grekes, haue bene on their parte. And also it is to be consideredde, howe we did that than, and howe they haue at this presente, done thys. For oure cytie, at that same tyme, was not gouerned by a lawfull pryncipalite of a small nomber of lordes, nor yet by the comon state: but by an othere fourme of lyuinge. whyche is ryght odyous, both to all lawes and to all cyties. And differeth not muche from tyrannye, to wytt, by the puyssance of certayne pa
                     •
                  ticulers, who, trustynge to enriche themselfe, if the Medes hadde obteigned the victory: constraigned vs to take their partie. whyche thynge neuerthelas the cytie for trouth did not vnyuersally. wherfore it shulde haue no reproche, not beinge than in her lybertie. But sens that it toke againe and recouered her lybertie, & her ancyent lawes, after departure of the straungers: It is to be consideredde yt whan the Athenyās had assaulted Grece, & would haue subdued our coūtrey vnto their domynyon, & in dede, whan they occupyed one parte therof throughe occasion of cyuyll dissensions: we after the victory, that we had against them at Cheroneus, haue not onely deliuered all the land of Beoce out of their seruitude,

but also nowe of a franke courage, we be ioyned wyth youe to delyuer the remnant of Grece from seruitude. In contrybutinge as greate nomber of people aswell fotemen as horsemen, as any other cytie of Grece. And this ys suffycyente for to purge and clere vs of the cryme, that they obiecte agaynste vs to haue takene parte wyth the Medes. But we woll payne oureselues to shewe, that youe Plateans haue more greatly offended Grece, and be worthy of greuous punishment. Youe saye that for to reuenge youe of vs, ye became allyes and burgeoses of the Athenyans. Than were it conuenyent, that youe shulde haue aydedde the sayde Athenyans agaynste vs onelye, and not agaynste all Grece, consyderinge that if they woulde haue constrayned you to yt, ye might haue had the Lacedemonyans, that wolde haue defended and saued youe, for the allyance chiefly, that was made betwene youe against the Medes, wherof youe make so great a buckler and defence. whyche also had bene suffycient to defende you agaynst vs, if we wolde haue wronged you. wherfore wythoute any doubte, youe haue wyllingly chosen the parte of the Athenyans. And after ye excuse yourselfe, sayinge that yt had bene shame for you to habandonne them, that meryted well towards you. But it was muche more shame to youe, to forsake for them, all the othere Grekes (wyth whome youe hadde made othe and allyance) than the Athenyans alone. And them, that wolde haue deliuered Grece frome seruytude, than those, that woulde brynge yt into bondage. wherein ye haue nott rendredde saruyce egally, nothere withoute youre shame. Forsomuche, as if they come to youre ayde, beynge by youe requyred, yt was to defende youe, lyke as youe youreselfe confesse. But ye arue comme to theirs, for to wronge othere. And yet neuerthelas, it is lesse dishonneste, not to rendre saruyce and pleasure in like case, where one oughte to do it by good reasone and iustice, then onelye, to wylle, to acquite it with an euille and vniuste quareile. Than, hauinge done the contrarye, youe haue suffycientlye declaredde, that the same, whiche youe onelye, amonge all the Beotieus, didde in resistynge againste the Medes, was nott onely for loue of the Grekes, butt rathere for that, that the Athenyans did take the contrarye part. fauourynge alwayes that, whyche they haue donne agaynste all the othere Grekes. And nowe youe wyll that those (agaynste whome ye haue bene wyth all youre power at the desyre and for the quarelle of othere) shulde doo youe good. whyche ys a thynge v

                  reasonable. But rathere it is conuenient, that sence youe haue chosen the Athenyans parte, that they ayde youe, if they maye. And it auaileth not that youe allege the confederation, that was made in that same tyme of the Medes, for to helpe youe wyth. Consyderedde that youe haue vyolatedde and brokenne yt, by geuinge ayde and succours to the Eginetes. And to certayne othere, that shulde haue bene subdewedde at the leage of Grece. And thys youe dydde not, for anye constrayncte, as wee dydde, takynge parte wyth the Medes: butt youe haue done yt with youre good wylle, beynge alwayes in youre lybertie, and lyuynge after your lawes, lyke as youe doo at thys present daye. And also youe haue nott regardedde the laste requeste and sommo
                     •

Thanne, what be all those amonge all the Grekes that may be more worthy to be hayted than youe, that woulde shewe youre valyauntnes and employe all youre power to their dammage. Declarynge by thys clerelye, that if youe haue at any tyme bene good (as youe haue sayde) it was not of nature. For the true inclynation of people is knowin whan yt ys permane

we followedde the partie of the Medes, agaynste oure wylle, & that youe haue folowedde that same of the Athenyans, wyllinglye. As touchynge that whyche youe haue sayde afterwardes, that we haue wrongedde and assaulted youe and your cytie vniustly, on your festiuall day and durynge the treatie of peace, we aunswere youe that euenne in this, we iudge that you haue more failledde and offended

                   than we. For if whan we came vnto youre cytie we had geuenne it assaulte

But if any your citezenis that were moost noble and richeste of the cytie (for that they desyred to withdrawe you from the alliance of straūgers and to come to the commen lawes of the Beotiens) came to requyre vs to go thyder, what iniurie haue we done? for if iniurie be therin committed, it ought to be rather imputed to them, that ledde our people, and not to them that were ledde, though that in our opinyon there was no offence naither on thone syde nor of the other. Considered that they yt were Cytezeins, as well as you, and had more to lese then youe, dyd openne vs the gates, and dydde lette vs into the Cytie (and that not ennemylyke, but peasablie) for

And so we came more for to moderate your wylles, then to extermyne & hurte youre parsons. And in reducyng you to the furst and auncyent fraternitie that we had togyders, we wolde that you shulde not haue had enmitie to any parson of the world, but that ye shuld haue lyued in good peace & amitie with all mē. And we shew well that it was our mynde, for whan we were within your towne, we did not any acte of enmitie, nother of violence to anye parsone, but we cawsed to be publysshed with the sounde of trompette, that all they, whiche wolde lyue after the common lawes of the Beotiens, shulde retyre vnto vs, wherunto ye agred wyllyngly, and came to treate and common with vs. But afterwardes, seing that we were in small nombre, you entreated vs not after that sort, yea, though ye than shuld & myght haue had colour to pretend that we had oultragyouslye vsed you to enter into your Cytie, without knowlaige and consent of the people. For you dyd not perswade vs by wordes and exhortacions to departe out of your Cytie, and not there to innouate or establysh any custome, wythout setting vpon vs ennemylyke, as you haue done. But contrary to the apoynctement and conuenaunt that we had cōcluded togyders, ye came to assa

But for them that yelded them selfe vnto you, and that ye dyd take lyuyng, promisinge to saue their lyues, we maynteygne, that you caused them to dye vngracyously and noughtely, and that you dyd withoute any doubte, an vniust & vngentle acte, in thre maners within a very smal space of time. To wit in breakyng your promes and apoynctement, afterwardes in kyllynge them with whom you had made it, & thirdly by promising vs deceitefully not to slay them: seinge yt we did no dammage in your land. And yet neuerthelesse you haue audacytie to saye, that we do you wronge, and that men wold punyshe you agaynst reasone. Truely ye shalbe declaredde innocentes and absolued of payne, if these iudges here woll iudge vniustlye. But if they be good Iudges, youe shall receiue punyshment for your mysdedes. which thyngs we haue called to remembraūce, Lordes Lacedemonyans, aswell for your interestes, as for ours, to wytte for yours, to the ende that condempnynge theyme, youe vnderstande to haue done iustyce. And for ours, to the intente that men maye knowe, that demandinge

& requiringe that they be punished, we haue in nothing cōspyred nor done any thynge worthye of reprehensyon. And youe oughte not to be moued vnto pytie, for the vertues and ancyēt glories of thies people here, if they haue hadde any. For suche thinges ought to helpe them, to whome men woulde do wronge. But vnto them that haue done any vyllaynous thyng, that same shuld double their payne, as to thies here, whyche nowe haue offended, wythout any reasonable occasion. Also the lamentations and pytefull rehersalles that they make, in requiringe to their ayde, the sepoulcres of your ancestors, and bewaylinge the lacke of their frendes, ought not to moue youe to pytie. For we do youe to vnderstande, that our yonge citezeins were muche more cruelly intreated by these here that slewe them. The fathers of whom, were partly slaine, in Coronie, bringinge vnto youe succour from Beoce. And the other that remayne in their age, depryuedde of theire childrenne, desolate in their howses, requyre thereof muche more reasonably vengeaunce, than thies here requyre grace. For they be aboue all othere worthye of mercye, that haue sufferedde wronge agaynste reasonne. But they that haue done yt, do merytt, that they, whyche haue suffredde yt, shuld reioyce themselfe by seynge theire calamyties. Lyke as thies be here, whoe, for their faulte, be thus habandōned, they beynge wyllyngly departedde frome theire beste frendes and allyes. And hauynge iniuriedde vs more throughe hatredde and euylle wylle, than by reasonne, wythoute hauynge bene by vs in anny thynge offendedde. And yette they shall nott suffre all the payne, that they desarue thoughe they shalbe at the presente punyshedde ryghte sharpely. And thys ys not true that they allege that they yeldedde them selues wyth theire good wylles, holdynge vp their handes againste vs in fayghtynge, butt they be by expresse couenaunte remyttedde to your iudgemente. wherefore the matters beynge suche as we haue sayde, wee requyre youe (lordes Lacedemonians) that youe woulde susteigne and helpe the lawe, which thies here haue offended, and to render vnto vs, that haue bene vniustlye wroungedde, grace and reward, accordynge to oure demerytte, for the saruyces that wee haue done throughe oure industrie and trauaille. In suche manner that it be not sayde, that wee haue hadde the repulse of youe, throughe the woordes of thys people here And to shewe example vnto al Grece, that you grounde not youreselfe vpon wordes, but vpon dedes. For truly whan matters be good of themself, there nedethe not manye woordes. But to coloure and mytigate a mysdede, it is very requysitt to vse artificiall and sturrynge woordes. And if those, that haue the authorytie to iudge, as it is wyth youe at thys presente, hauynge somarely knowin the difficulties and doubtfull causes, woulde thereupon ordeyne at ones, wythoute puttynge agayne the matters into disputatyon: men shulde not study somuche to forge fayre woordes in villaynous thynges. Thus spake the Thebayns. After that the iudges Lacedemonyans, hadde hearde bothe the parties, they determynedde to persyste in theire interrogation, to wytte, if they hadde merytedde any grace of the sayde Lacedemonyans, durynge the warre. Forsomuche as yt semedde vnto theyme that in the tyme passedde, they were gouernedde reasonablye after the lawes and conuentyons of Pausanyas, vntyll they refusedde the parte to remayne newter, afore they were assiegedde. And that sence they hadde refused yt, the same Lacedemonyans were not bounde by the sayde conuenauntes. And also the sayde Plateens hadde by that meane, yll acquytedde themselfe towardes theym. So they causedde them all to comme one after the other. And demaūded of them, as aboue. And seing that they answered nothing, they caused thē to be caried frōthēs into an other place. where they al were slaine

wythout that any one eskaped. whiche were found of Plateens more than twoo houndred, and of Athenyans, that were come to their ayde, twenty and fyue, and the women caryed awaye prysonners. As touchinge the cytie, the Thebains dyd geue it to the Megaryans who were dryuene from their cytie, through the deuisions amonge them, and vnto other Plateēs, that had taken their parte: for to inhabitt there. But the yeare gone about, they plucked it downe from the bottome vp by the foundations, and buylded it newe agayne nighe vnto the temple of Iuno, nexte the whyche, they made a palais, the largenes whereof, was twoo houndred fote, of all sides, in forme of a cloister, hauinge houses and habytations of all sydes aboue and benethe, wherin they dyd bestowe, all the plākes, the portes and the other faire ornamentes of the houses, that they had plucked downe. And also furnished them wyth couches and beddes, and did dedicate all vnto the said goddesse, to whome moreouer they edyfied a newe temple, all of stone entailled or karued, conteigninge an houndred foote of lengthe. Touchinge the terrytorie of the said cytie of Platee, yt was lett to farme & to laboure for tenne yeres, to wytt, to the Thebains, one small portione, & to the Lacedemonyans the greateste parte. whiche they did take for to doo pleasure to the saide Thebayns. For also by this same cause, they were so contrary to the sayd Plateens. Thinkinge that the sayd Thebains mighte helpe them greatly and do thē greate seruyce in that warre, whiche they hadde bigonne agaynst the Athenyans. Such ende, toke the siege of Platee, foore skoore and thirtene yeares, after, that the Plateens had made allyance wyth the Athenyans.
            
            
               Howe the Peloponesians had an victory by sea against the Athenyans and Corcyrians that toke their parte, by meanes of the deuysion, that was moued amonge the sayd Corciriens. ☞The .xi. Chapter.
               IN thies enterfeates and busynes, the forty ships, that the Peloponesians had sente vnto ye succours of Lesbos, parceyuinge the comming of the armye by sea of the Athenyans, that came againste them: they enforsed themselfe to retire with the most diligence, that they coulde. Being chased by fortune of the sea into Creta, & fromthens withoute order, making towards Peloponese, they encountred in their way nighe vnto Cyremus, thirtene galleys, which were of the Leucadyans and Ambrasyans. wherof Brasidas,Brasidas. sonne of Tallides,Tellides. was Capytaine, and for his counseillour he had Alcidas who was comme thider to hym. For the Lacedemonyans, hauing failled thenterpryse of Lesbos, renewed and strengthenedde agayne their armye by sea, and sente them into Corcyre, vnderstanding, that the towne was in deuision, & knowinge, that the Athenians had in all, but twelue ships in that quartier, which they kept at Naupacte. For this cause they ordoned to the sayd Alcidas & Brasidas, that they shulde departe from the sayde place, bifore the Athenians shulde parceyue yt, thinkinge that the matter shulde come to good effecte, through the dissension, that was amonge the Corcyriens. By occasion of thys, that those amonge them, that were takenne by the Corynthians in the bataylle by the sea, that was at Epidanne, beynge by the same Corynthyans sente agayne vnto their houses vnder coloure to go to seke the raunsonne that their frendes of Corinthe hadde aunswered for them, whych. amountedd to foore skoore talentes:

                  de towardes the other Citezens for to cause them to departe from the allyance of the Athenyans. So it chanced that duringe thys tyme, arryued two shyppes at the porte of Corsyre, the one sent by the Corinthiens and the other by the Atheniās. And in both of them were Ambassadours from the sayde two Cities for to practyse and get the Corciriens, whiche were hearde, and had audyence the one after the other. And the conclusion and answere of ye sayde Corciriens was that they wolde remayne allyes and confederates of thathenians accordynge to their pac

Who thā had greatest auctoritie in ye towne, and had made himselfe a burgeose of Athens. By occasion wherof, the other yt laboured to the contrary as we have shewed, caused him to be called into Iudgemente charginge him that he woulde brynge the Citie into subieccion of the Athenians, But he was absolued and discharged of that accusacion. And anone after, he accused fyue of the sayde aduersaries, the rychest of all, chargynge thē yt they had rased downe the pales that were at the closture of the temple of Iupiter and Alcinas, in whiche case the penaltie was ordeyned by theyr lawe, to be one s

The other, that toke parte with Pithias, saued them selfe in ryght small nombre and rendred them into the shippe of the Athenians, which yet was within the porte. After that the coniuratours and conspicers had done this execusion, they assembled and shewed them that ye, which they had done was for ye weale of the Cytie, and yt they shuld not be reduced to ye seruitude of the Atheniens, and in the remenante they ought to shewe themselfe newter betwene the Athenians and the Peloponescians, and to signefye them and make answere to them both, that they shulde not come into their porte, but peasablie and with one shy

And as for the rest that al the othere shulde tary in the Citye, as before and that all wyth one accorde shulde confirme agayne the allyance wyth the Athenyans, to wyt, to be frendes of frendes, and ennemyes of ennemyes. After yt this appoinctement was so concluded and agrede, the principallest and chiefest of the people, treated wyth Nicostratus, that he shulde leue them fyue of the shyppes to defende, that the other partye shulde not ryse nor sturre. And moreouer that he shulde charge and take into hys other shippes, those that they shulde aduertise to be of the contrarye parte, and cary them awaye wyth hym, to thintente that they myght not make anye mutyne and insurrection, whyche thynge he graunted them. But so as they made the rolle of theyme, whome they wolde haue charged vpon the sayde shippes, they fearinge to be caryed into Athenes wythdrewe themselfe into franchise and sanctuarye, into the temple of Castor, and Pullur. And though that Nicostratus dyd put them in comforce and exhorted them to come

with hym, yet coulde he not perswade thē. By occasiō wherof the people wente into there houses, & toke all the harnes that they had, and had slayne some, that they encountred, yf that Nicostratus had not empesched & letted them, whiche perseaued by the other, that were of that bende, they wythdrewe them selues into the temple of Iuno, to the noumber of foore houndred, whereby the people, fearynge, lest they wolde make some innouation and noueltie, he perswaded thē so, that they were contente to be sent into a Isle that was foranempste the sayde temple in the whiche, they shulde be furnisshed of that, that was necessarye for their lyuinge. The thinges being in suche estate, foure or fyue dayes, after that the sayde Citezenis were caryed into the sayde Islande, the shypps of the Peloponesians that remayned in Cyllene, after theyr retourne from Iouiū, whereof Alcidos was Capytanie and his counsaillor Brasidas whiche were in noumber Liii. arryued in the porte of Sybota, whiche is a Citie in the mayne land, and at the breake of the daye, they tooke theyr waye towardes Corcyre, whiche parceyued by the Citezenis, they were much astonyed, aswel through cause of theyr Ciuylle dessencions as also for the comynge of the ennemys. And so they armed thre skoore shippes wyth theyr people and sente them the one after the other to mete wyth the ennemys, so as they were charged. Howe be it the Athenyans prayed them that they wolde suffre them to go for moste in the Battaille & that they wolde come afteral togider. Nowe the Corcirians saillinge thus despersed and oute of ordre, after that they bygonne to approche and drawe nyghe vnto ye Peloponesians, two of the same Corcyrians shipps came to Ioigne wyth them and they that were wythin the other dyd fight togithers amonge themselfes wythout anye order, whiche parcey

And the nyght folowynge, signe was made vnto them by his lyghts, that ther was departed thre skoore shypps Athenyans from Leucade, whiche made against them, lyke as it for trouth was. For the Athenyans vnderstandinge the dessencion and mutyne, that was in the cytye of Corcyre, and the aryuall of the shyppes that Alcydas cōducted, they sent Eurymedone, sonne of Thucleas wyth the sayde .lx, shyppes i

Whych thing they vnderstandynge that abodde in the temple, dyd euery one kyll them selues. Some hanged themselfe vpon trees, other dyd slaye the one the other amonge themselfe, other by other meanes, in suche maner, that there eskaped not one, & moreouer durynge the space of seuene dayes, that Euremedon taryed there wt the three skoore shyppes, the Corcyryans caused all them of the Cytie to dye, that they toke for theyr enemyes vnder couloure that they wolde subuerte and destroye the common estate.

               The conspiraties and partialyties that arose, aswell in the Citie of Corcyre, as in all other cities of Grece, by meanes of the warre that was bitwene the Athenyans and the Peloponesians, & the execrable euilles yt therby chanced. ¶The xii. Chapter.
               THat seditious and ciuile dissention semed somuche more cruell, for that yt was the furst, that chaunced in that same quartier, but afterwardes, it raigned in manner, through all the Cities of Grece. For the more parte of the people toke partie wyth Thatheniens: and the most honest, the same wyth the Lacedemonyans, whiche parcialitte and occasion of Cyuile dessention, they had not had afore that warre. But during ye same they ceased not to call to theyr ayde, those of the one parte, for to anoye the other For they that desired to haue mutation and change were well aysedde to haue that coulour and occacion wherby many greate and haynous euilles chaunced in the Cities, and shall happen alwaies as longe as the people shalbe of such nature and inclynacion, whither they be the greatest, meaner, or of the other sorte, after that the cases of the mutacions and chaunses shall happen, whiche, thinge chaunceth not in tyme of peace. For that, that the people haue better opynyon & wyl, aswel in publique matters, as in particular, not being constrayned to come to thies forced ennemyties.

                  ates and gouernours of the Cyties of Grece, by reason of the cyuill seditions. And whan it was knowin that an Insolencie hadde bene done and commytted in one place, the other toke couraige, yet to do worse, for to make some newe matter, or to shewe that they were more diligente and inuentiue, than the other, orelles more insolente and desirous to reuenge themselfe. Aud all the euylles whiche they commytted, they disguised and named by newe and vnaccustomed names. For temeritie and rashnes, they named magnanymytie and noblenes of courage, so that the rashe were named vertuous defendors of theyr frendes. And slackenes and faintnes, they named an honest feare. And modestie, they named couered pusillanimytie or cowardenes. A hedlinge indignatiō, manhode and hardynesr. Prudente cosultaciō and deliberatinge in causes, a sensed and clokedde deceate. And in effect he yt shewed hymselfe alwayes furious, was reputed a faythfull frende, and he yt spake againste hym, was holden for suspect. He, that well executed his enterpryses and vengeaunce, was reputed wyse and of knowlaige, and yet more the same, whiche preuented suche lyke mischefe of his ennemye, or that prouyded, yt on his parte not one man shulde shrynke from the faction and deede, or els that shulde ones feare the ennemys. And in a totall some, he that was most prompt and redy to hurte an other, was most praysed. And yet more. he, that instructed other to do that to an other, that he thought not on. And also this compaigny and consederation was greater amonge the strange people, than amonge parentes, for yt they were moste ready to do eny enterprise wythout any refusal and excuse. 
                     •
                  or also they made not thies assembles and conspiracions by aucthorite of lawes, nor for the welthe of the comon weale, but for a couetousnes against all reason. And the fayth whiche they kepte amonge themselfe, was not for any religion that th

had, but for to continue that pestelence, and that same cryme, in the comō weale, If anye of the compaigny sayde anye good and honest thyng to ye contrary, they wolde not accepte it for suche, nother as commyng of a noble courage. But if they myght defende it wyth dede, they loued muche better to reuenge thē selfe than not to be oultraged. If they made any appoinctemente wyth solempne othe: it endured, vntyl one of the partyes founde it selfe strongest. But for ye leaste occasion that he coulde fynde his compayguion at his aduantage, he was more Ioyefull to apprehende hym vnder coulour of that appoyntmente, than if he had defyed hym byfore, aswell for that, that it was moore sure, as also that it semed vnto him a greate prudencie to haue ouercomed yt stryfe, through malice. For also this thinge is more comone, that the vnhappy and euyll (whereof the nomber is infinitt) may be rather called industrious, than the symple and innocent, be named good. And also comonly the people be ashamed to be so symple, and reioyse to bee vngracious. All whiche thynges proceded of auaryce and couetice of other mens goodes. And there vpon arose the conspiraties and partakynge. For they that were Capitanes of the bendes for the cyties, dyd take euerye one an honest occasion of theyr partialitie, to wytt, they that susteigned ye comon estate, sayde that it was a cyuill Equalitye. And they that maignteigned the gouernaunce of a small nomber of particuler people, sayed, that the rule of the richeste men, was that same, that ought to be preferred. And thus dyd euery one debate to maigteigne the comon weale
                     •
                   as in wordes: but ye ende of theyr debate and question, & of the effect of theyr victorye, was to enterpry

But for pleasure that they had to see the euell, happene the one to the other, it was compassed by faulse condempnacyons and vyolente oppressyons beyng alwayes ready and dysposed to execute soubdamely, theyr euyll intente wyth oute hauinge any regarde, to the relygion of goddes, in thinge that they had done nor what they had contracted. But he tha

                   vnderconlour of deceitful and crafty woordes, coulde best deceyue the other, was most estemed. And if there were any that wolde be newter wythout takynge the one parte or the other, he was ouertrodene by bothe partes, the cause was for that, that he toke not theyr parte, or for enuy that they had to see hym in reste, and exempted frome euills, that thother susteigned. And in suche manner, by meane of the factions aud bendes, all the countrey of Grece endured all sortes of euylles. And the simplicitie (whereof the noblenes was chiefe parttaker) was extermyned & persecuted wyth greate derisyon. And it was taken for an excelent thynge, to preuente the assaultes and enterpryses the one of the other. And if at any tyme they reconcyled themselfe togyder, there was no suertye in wordes, nor feare & reuerence to the othe, that they had made. But rather for the diffidence and mistrust that they had, the one of the other: they loued better to stande at theyr defence, fearynge to be circumuented, than to geue faythe to the promesses of theyr ennemys. And chiefly the rudest and lesser hable people did veray often prouide better, for theyr case: than the more hable. For knowing the inbicilitye of ye other and by that meane, fearynge to be abused wyth theyr wordes and surprised and circūuented by theyr subtyl wyttes they came furst rashely to the workes of ye dede. Where the more wyse and more hable

                   for the small estymacion that they had of the other, trustynge that by theyr wytte and malyce they wolde prouyde for thynges afarre of, and also wyllynge to execute theyr enterpryses, rather by counsayll and knolage, than by force, were very oftene circumuented and ouercome.

Many suche examples of audacite and rashenes were sene at Corcyre. And moreouer they that were ruled and gouerned did all thinges, more by violence and by oultrage, than by reasone and by modestie. Taking vengeance of the vniust punishmentes that had bene done vnto them or vnto their frendes. And likewyse that, whyche the poore did that woolde haue enryched themself, or they whiche coueted the goodes of their neighbour. which they hoped to obteigne by exacte and vnlawfull meanes (whyche was one of the pryncipall causes of the sayde euyls) & also those, that were not moued by couetyce, but rather by indignation and ignorance: thinkinge that that was lawful, did all those thinges cruelly and without any brydle of reasone. For that manner of insolent & troublesome lyuinge, did treade downe and vainquishe all lawes, and the cōmon and accustomed nature of men. And declared well t

                  at they did trangresse & violate them wyllingly, inasmuche as it shewed itself more debile and weake, than angrie and wrathfull, and more puissante, than all the lawes, ennemye of theyme that had moost goodes, preferrynge vengeaunce before iustice, and rapyne bifore innocentie, and enuyinge the power, there as in nothinge they coulde hurte yt, corruptinge and violatinge for desyre of vengeaunce, ye disposition of the lawes. wherin all men ought to haue hope of helthe and cōfort, without resaruinge to themself any other meane to helpe themself in any affayr or daunger that might chaunce. Suche thinges were done, & perpetrated among the Corcyrians, furste & bifore that it was in the other cyties, Eury medon wyth hys people, being wtin the same. who afterwardes departed fromthence. And after his departure, those, of the cytie that were saued, whiche were to the nomber of fyue houndred, toke the walles, that were in the mayne lāde. And by that meane enioyed their lands. And moreouer they wente to ouerron the Isle, and did muche hurte & had great bowties and prayes of the inhabytantes therof, wherby the cytie came into great necessitie of victuaile. Afterwardes, they sente Ambassadours to the Lacedemonyans and to the Corinthians, demaunding of them succour for to reenter into the cytie, but seinge that they could haue none fromthence, wythin a tyme after, they assembled a certayne nomber of shippes and souldyars strangers, with the whiche they entred into the Isle, and were there in all about sixe houndred. And after yt they were landed, they did burne their shippes, to the ende that they shuld not hope to retourne. Afterwarded, they wente to wynne the moūte of Histonus. wherin they fortefyed themselfe wyth walles, so that they gouerned the terrytorie, and did greate dammage to them that were wythin the cytie.

And yet notwythstanding, the cytezeins, for the euyll that was done in their lande, wold not issue fourthe, but kepte themself sure wtin their cytie. whyche seynge the Acarnanyans, made great instance to Demosthenes, duke of the Athenyans, that he would assiege & locke them in wyth walles. Hoping that the towne might easely be takene. And by that meane, they shulde be in suertie, for that the Leucadyans were their ancyent ennemys. But Demosthenes, who for that tyme gaue more creditt to the Messenyans, was by thē perswaded to leue ye enterpryse & to go to make warre against the Etholiens, hauing so great an armye, aswell for that, that they were mortall enemys of Naupacte, as also for that, that they sayde, that in vainquisshinge and subdewynge the sayd Etholyens, they shulde after reduce and bring easely all the remenaunt of the countrey of Epyre, to the obeyssance of the Athenyans. And although that the sayd Etholians were a great nomber of people & good warryours, yet it semed to the sayd Messenians, that they might easely be vainquished, aswell for that their townes were not closed wyth walles, and also were farre distant the one from the other, wherby they myght not easely succour the one the othere: as also for that they were all ill armed and after the slightest manner. And their aduise was, that the Apadotes shulde be furst assaylled, afterwardes the Ophioniens, and consequently the Eurytanyens.Eurytanes. whyche is the greatest partie of Etholyens. whyche be people, in manner sauaige and wylde of manners, and of language.

For hauynge subdued them there, it semedde well, that the othere myghte afterwardes be easely subdued.

But of that same preparacion, the Etholiens were suffyciently aduertised, and that from the tyme chiefly that he hade enterprised for to ouerronne thē. Wher vpon incontynently, as they were entred into theyr countrey, they assembled togither from all partes, and chiefly came thyder, those of Ophionie, which be in ye vttermoste parte of the countrey nygh the Goulphe of the sea,The goulphe yt is called Maliaquus.Malycu

And lykewyse the Bomiens and the Galliens durynge this tyme that they assembled themselfe, the Messeniens, folowynge the counsaylle, that they had geuen to Demosthenes, perswadinge hym that the sayde Etholiens were easye to vaniquishe, they counsaylled him to go as sone as he myght, to wynne the townes and vyllages of the countrye, byfore the enemys were all assembled. Ensuyng which counsaille, and trustyng in his good fortune (forsomuche as hetherto nothinge had chaunced hym to the contrary) wythout tarying succours of the Locriens, which myght haue bene verye necessarye for hym, for that they were people of trect, lyghtly armed, he wente agaynst the towne of Egytie,Agitum the which he dyd take wythout resystyng, for that that the inhabytāce had forsakē it and were retired into the mountaignes, that be aboute the towne, whiche is situated in a hygh place, aboute soore stades, frome the sea. Nowe there was ariued the other Etholiens and were lodged in dyuers quarters of the sayde mountaynes, all the whiche, at one fronte, came to assayle the Athenians and theyr allies on all sides wt greate strockes of shotte and casting with the hande.

By meane wherof there was manye deade in the flyghte. For that that the Etholyens, whiche were lyghtly armed incontynently ouertoke them specyallye those that knewe not whythere to flyee. And for that, that one parte was sauyde

by passynge thwart a woode, they put fyer wythin it, and were all burnedde. So that there was no manner of flyinge and of deathe, that was not thanne sene in the hoste of Athenyans, And with greate payne, a very small nomber of theyme, that escaped from that battaille, might saue themselfe in the place of Eneone, in the countrey of Locres, from whence they were departed. And there died of the confederates a veray great nomber, and of the Athenyans sixe skoore, all yonge menne, and of the beste warryours that they had, togiders wyth procles, one of the beste Dukes and Capytains. After that discomsiture, they, that were vainquished, confessinge to the ennemyes the victorye: recouered their deade. And retourned (that done) vnto Naupacte. And fromthence to Athenes.

Afterwardes they wente bifore the cytie of Molictyon, whsche was a Colonie or habitacion of the Corinthiās, but neuerthelas they toke part with ye Athenians, and soo toke it by force. Nowe Demosthenes Athenyan was yet in that quarter of Naupacte, whoe kepte hymselfe there, after the losse that he had had in Etholie.

And that done that he mighte easely brynge to the allyaunce of the Lacedemonyans, all the countrey of Epire. For this cause, and vnder hope of thys enterpryse, Eurylochus passedde not further into the countrey of Etholyans, attendynge the succours of the Ambracyens. And in the meane tyme the sommer passedde. At the entrynge of wynter, the Athenyans, that were in Sycile wyth theire allyes, and all those, that dydde take their partie agaynste the Syracusayns, came to assaylle the Cytye of Nyse.Nisa.

And vnderstanding the cōming of Demosthenes, they came to ioigne wt him, and made him their Capitain, wt the capytains, that they had of their countrey. who came to plante his cāpe nighe inough to Olpas, & to the campe of ye ennemys, so that there was but one valley bitwene both, that defended & empesched them fyue dayes to fight. The sixt daye they prepared them self for to geue battell on both sides. But for that the Peloponesiās were much more mightie in nomber of people, than the other: Demosthenes fearinge to be inclosed wt the multitude of enemys, dyd set, in a lowe way couered with thicke bushes, an embushemēt of four hoūdred men all wel armed, & also armed lightlye. To whom he cōmaunded, that whan they shulde see that the battayle was bigonne, they shulde issue fourthe and come to stryke with great force vpon the backes of the ennemys. And wt the reste he ordeyned his battaille as he thought good, and put himself in the righte winge with the Messenyans, and a small nō
                  bre of Athenians that he had. And on the lest winge he putte the Acarnanyans euene as they were armed togithere wyth the Amphilochians, whiche were all people of shott. On the other side the Peloponesians and the Ambracyans were all myngledde, the one wythe the othere, resaruedde the Mantynyans, whyche were altogider on the lefte syde, not at the extremytie and wythe the poyncte, but more forewardes. For in that wynge Eurylochus hadde bestowed hymselfe wyth the people dyrectely agaynste Demosthenes, who was in the ryghte wynge on the othere syde wyth the Messenyans. The battaille than beinge bigonne, and they that were in the ambushemente, parceyuynge that the Peloponesians that were on the lefte hande, enuironedde and wente aboute to enclose the Athenyans that were on the other syde on the ryghte wynge, came to charge vpon them at their backes, so that they causedde them to forgette their vertue, and dydde putte theym into dysorder and flyghte. And so shewedde the waye to the greateste parte of the othere, that were wyth theym in the ryghte wynge, to flye as they dydde. For seing that same bende that Eurylochus conducted, which was ye strongest, in disorder: they lost their courage to defende themselfe. And yet

neuerthelas, the Ambracians, that were in the ryght wynge, repoulsed their enn
                     •
                  myes in theire parte, and chased them to the cytie of Argos. For also the same Ambracyans be better warryours, than any of their neighbours. But as they retourned frome the chase, seinge theire compaignyons almoste all destroyed, and thennemys, that came strayghte vpon theym: they retyred wyth greate payne and danger into Olpas. And also there were many slayn for that, that they kept not order, resarued the Mantynyans, which kepte alwaye their order, in retiring themselfe. And the battaille cessed nighe vpon the night. The morowe after, Menedeus,Menedeus. that was that night chosen capytayne in stede of Eurylochus that was deade, founde hymselfe in greate difficultie and perplexitie of that, whiche he had to do. For through the destruction that had bene great on his syde, he sawe nott the meane to defende the towne beinge assieged by sea & by land, nother to retyre wythoute greate daunger. For thys cause he sente to Demosthenes and Capytains of the Acarnanyans, for to demaunde the corpses of theire men that were slayne, and also that those, that were in the towne, men of warre, mighte depart fromthence wyth their baguage saued. who rendred vnto them their corpses, and caused those to be buryed that were slayne on their parte, which were about thre houndred. And afterwardes they dyd sett vp their Trophee in token of victorye, but as touchinge the lycence to depart, they woolde not graunte it openly, but refused and denied it generally to all. Notwithstandinge they graunted yt secretely to the Mantynians and to all the Peloponesians that were of any estimation. Myndinge by that meane, to separate the Ambraceans frō all the souldiors straungers and also to diffame the Lacedemonyans and Peloponesians vnto all the Grekes, as faynte harted & traitors, to make their appoinctemente, wythoute comprehending therin their allyes. Than they that were in the town, hauynge engraued and buryed their deade, with the most hast that they might, those that had obteigned lycence to departe, treated togithere secretely the manner of their departure. Durynge this tyme, Demosthenes and the Acarnanyans were aduertysed that the Ambracyans, whyche were departed from their cytie for to comme to the succours of their people, that were at Olpas, accordinge to the comaundement geuen vnto them at the begynning, lyke as hath bene bifore sayde: were vpon their iourney for to come thider, throughe the countrey of Amphilochiens, wythout that they had knowlayge of the newes of the destruction of their sayd people. So he sent parte of his menne to kepe the passages and the stronge wayes. And the remenant of hys people, he ordeined for to succour them there, and to sett vpon the sayd Ambracyans, whan they shulde passe. Bitwene bothe, those, that had treated to go awaye, issued oute of the towne in smal bendes, faigninge to go to gather herbes and woode in the feldes, & whan they were a lytle departed from the towne, they set themself to ronne againste the campe of enemyes. whiche seinge the Ambracyans, that were lykewyse come fourth for to gather herbes and woode, folowed them, as faste as they myghte for to ouertake them. But the souldyars Acarnanyans, whyche knewe nothynge of the secrett appoynctement, that Demosthenes and their Capytains hadde made wyth the Peloponesyans, thinkinge that all those, that issued fourth of the towne, departed frothence wythoute lycence and wythout appoyntement: prepared them selfe to followe them. And for that, that some of the Capytains that found them there
                     •
                   woulde haue empesched them to ronne vpon the Peloponesians, sayinge that they had saulfconduict, there were of them that enforced themself to strike them, and made their weapons ready agaynste them, thinkinge that they hadde deceyued and betrayed them. Yet vnderstandinge, that, the Peloponesians and

Mantynyans alonely, had the saulfconducte, they suffred vnto them to passe & kylled the Ambracyens. But there was greate questyon & difficultie to discerne the one from the other, so that in the same tumulte, there were slayn about two houndred. The other saued themselfe wyth greate difficultie wythin the towne of Agride.Agrais. whiche was nexte vnto them there. whome Salynthius,Salynthius. kynge of Agriens, did reteigne as their frende. In this meane tyme, the other Ambracyens that came to the succours of thies here, arryued at one place named Idomene,Idomene. whyche hath two hilles or toppes. The greatest wherof, those, that Demosthenes hadde sente bifore did take and occupie in the night seasonne, wythout that the Ambracyans did apperceyue them. who did saise themself of the lesser, wher they kepte them all that same daye and night following, without doubting any thynge. In the meane tyme, Demosthenes, beynge aduertised of their cominge, departed from his campe after supper at the entrynge of the night wyth al hys hooste, wherof the one half he ledde wyth hym. And the other halfe he causedde to go through the mounteignes of Amphilochie, & vsed soo good diligence, that at breake of the daye he came to rushe vpon the sayde Ambracyans, whome he founde yet all slepinge, as people assured, and that knewe nothing of that, which was happened. But thought at the begynning that they had bene of their owne compaigny. For that, that Demosthenes, the better to deceyue them, had caused the Messenyans to marche bifore the othere, and had commaunded them, that they shulde speake in languaige Dorique with those, whiche they founde furste in the watche, whiche thinge they did. So that the said ennemys thoughte, that they had bene their owne people, the rather for that, that they coulde not wel see them, insomuch as it was not yet day, vntill that the bend of enemys were aryued. And they than did stryke vpō them all at ones, and did slay a great parte of them. The other did flye by the mountaignes, of whome yet the more part was slayne. For that they founde the Amphilochians that hadde gottone and kepte the passages. And forsomuche as they were lyghtely armed, and thies here well armed, they ouertoke them incōtynently. And those that kepte the other pathes, clymed vp to the highe rockes and Cauarns, and cast themself downe, backwardes. Some there were that wente to the sea side, that was there very nigh, who beinge followed by their ennemys, and seing the galleys of the Athenians, which sailled, costing the lande, they did cast themselfe into the water, and swymmed to yelde them vnto the sayd galleys. For though they did knowe that they were vesselles of the ennemys, yet they had rather fall into their handes (albeit that they had desarued to be slayne of them) than into the handes of the straungers or of the Amphilochiās that were their mortal enemys. The Ambracyās being in this manner in disorder, were as in a maner all slayn. And a very small nōber saued themself wythin the towne of Olpas.Olpa. Aftere tha

                   destruction, the Acarnanyans, hauinge spoyled their deade, and set vp theire Trophee in tokene of victory, they retourned to Argos, towardes whome, came, the morowe following, a herault sente frome the Ambracyans that were saued wythin Agryde. For to demaunde the corpses of their people that had bene slayne at the furst discomsiture, whan they yssued oute of Olpas, wyth the Peloponesians wythoute saulfconducte. who, seinge vpon the campe, the dead in so greate nombre, was greatly abashed, howe it might be that they were so many, not knowinge any thinge of the laste murther, and thought that they were the corpses of their allyes. Than one of the ennemys, thinkynge that he was come for them there that had bene last destroyed at Idomene demaunded of hym, wherfore he made so greate admyratyon, and howe many people he vnderstode to haue bene slayne of his. And

he answered, that aboutes two houndred. Than the othere sayde vnto him, thou seist welle that there be in thys same trophe the armes not of two houndredde, but of a thousande and more that haue bene slayne. Truly sayed the heraulde, thies be not than of those that were in oure bende. But they be trulye sayth the other, euen the same, that were yesterday slayne at Idomene. Howe so sayde the Herault, we did not fyght yesterday, but thies here were slayne bifore yesterday, yssuing out of Olpas wythout saulfconduct. By my fayth sayd the other, we did fight yesterday against thies here, whych were come from Ambracie for to come to the succours of them that were at Olpas. Which thing, being vnderstode by the Herault, & knowynge the greate losse that the Ambracyans had had, he was so osto
                     •
                  yed that he retourned wythout pursuing further for the recouery of the dead. For also for trouthe, this was one of the greatest destructiōs that chaunced in all that same warre, specyally in one onely cytie and in so fewe dayes. And also I am not mynded to set the nombre of the dead, for that, that it semeth vnto me incredible, and greater, than is conuenable to the greatnes of that same towne. One thinge I knowe veray well and for mere trouthe, that if the Acarnanyans and the Amphilochians had bene wyllynge to bileue and credytt Demosthenes and the Athenyans, they hadde euenne at the same tyme, takene the cytie of Ambracie by force. But they fearedde, leste if the Athenyans shulde take it, that they shulde be tomuche harde and straighte neighbours for them. After this victory, they departed the bowtie or praye bitwene them. Whereof they didde geue the th

                  rde parte vnto the Athenyans, and the other two, they distrybuted amonge the cyties. But that, whyche the Atchenyans had therof, was not greately profytable to them. For in their retournynge by sea, the most parte was taken awaye from them in their iourney. And thre houndredd complete harnoys, that be yet sene hanginge in the temples of Athens, were those, whiche Demosthenes alone had for his parte, whyche he dyd geue, after, that he was retourned. whych thing he dydde more assuredly by meanes of that victorye, than he durste haue done bifore, by cause of the ouerthrowe that he had hadde in Etholie. After that the twenty galleys of the Athenyans were retourned to Naupacte, and Demosthenes wyth the bende vnto Athens: the Acarnanyans and the Amphiloch

And the fourme of the appoinctmente was this

                   that the said Ambracyās shuld not be bounde to make warre wt the Acarnanyās against the Peloponesians. Nor the Acarnanyās wt the Ambracyans against the Athenyans. But only they were bound to ayde themself, the one, the other, for the defence of their lande alonely, & moreouer that the Ambracyans shuld rendre & restore to the Amphilochiens, all the townes and landes, that they helde of theirs & that they shulde not geue any ayde, supportacion or fauour to the Anactoriās, who were ennemys of the Acarnanyans. Upon thys condition they ceased from warre, on the one syde and on the other. Anone after arryued Xenoclides, sonne of Entycles wt thre hoūdred men, that the Corinthians had sent to succo

In that same wynter, the Athenyans that were in Sycille, being landed and entred into Hiemereus on the sea syde, and the Sycilyans on the coste of the mountaignes, and hauyng there made somme bowtie and praye, and fromthence hauynge passedde by the Isles, Eolydes: they came agayne to Rhege.

Whereof they had onely sente, one lesser parte bifore by Pythodorus, for to see and vnderstande the estate of causes, & after they shuld sende hym Syphocles, sonne of Sestratides with the remnaunte. Beynge than Pythodorus arryued and hauynge takene the charge of the armye, he wente frō thens to succour the cytie of Locres, which Laches had taken. But he was encō

                   that had called them thider. whiche enterprise the sayd Syracusains dyd, for somuche, as seinge that same towne to be very propyte & mete for the sayd Athenyans for to enter into Sycille, they feared that by meane thereof, they woulde lande there wyth greater strengthe, and from thence wold come to assaille them and the Locriens: to haue meane for to assaille on bothe sydes theym of Rhege, that were their ennemys. whyche thynge they dydde incontynently after, and also to the ende, that they shulde not geue succours to the sayd Messenyans. And moreouer they were therunto sollicyted by certayne cytezeins of Rhege, who beinge bannyshedde and fledde from their cytie, were retyredde to Locres. For the sayde Cytie of Rhege hadde long

the oportunytie, came then to assaile them and aftere that they had ouerronned and pyllagedde all thair terytorie, they retyredde wyth theire men on foote by lande into theire countreye. For the shyppes wherin they were come, were gone to Missena for to ioygne with the other, that shulde be there assembled for to make warre on that side. In that selfe seasone, bifore that the coarne was rype, the Peloponesians entered a fresh into the lande Atticque, vnder the cōducte of Agis,Agis. sonne of Archidamus, kynge of Lacedemonyans and pyllaged yt after the accustomedde manner. On the othere side, the Athenyans sente foorty shippes wyth newe strength into Sycylle, whereof they commytted the conducte to Eurimedon and to Sophocles wyth the other that already were there.
                     Eurimedon.
                     Sophocles.
                   Among whom, was Pythodorus,Pythodorus. and commaunded them in thair waye to geue comforte and succoure to the Corcyriens agaynste thaire bannyshed men, whiche kepte them selfe in the mountaignes and warredde vpon them wythout, and also agaynste lx. shyppes that the Pelloponesians hadde sente agaynste theym, that were in the saide cytie, trustynge to take it by famyne for that, that it nowe was in great skarcytye of vyctualles. And also grauntedde to Demosthenes, who hadde sens hys retourne frome Acarnanie tarryedde at Athens wythoute any charge, and desyeredde greately to haue some, to vse the saide foorty shyppes aboute Peloponese, as he shulde thincke good. Beynge than arryued in the countreye of Lacaonie, in passynge theire iourney, and vnderstandynge that the saide Pelloponesians shyppes were alreadye arryued in the goulphe of Corcyre, they were of dyuers opynyons amonge themself. For Eurymedon and Sophocles were determyned to go fourthwythe to Corcyre. But Demosthenes saide that they shuld furste go to take Pylus, and hauinge geuen order there, to drawe vnto Corcyre, and yet neuerthelas, seinge that the other two persysted and contynewed in their opynyō, he commaunded them so to do. In thys debate, there came soubdaynly a tempeste of the sea, that constrayned them to drawe to the sayde place of Pylus. And than Demosthenes shewede vnto theme that yt was nedefull to close that place wyth a walle, sayinge, that yt was the pryncypall cause that he was come wyth them for, in that voyage. And moreouer that yt was veary easye to do, for there was power, stones and matter for to acheue shortely their worke. And that the scite of the place was stronge, and also had aboute yt a greate desarte countrey. For fromthence vnto Spartus, there were well foore houndred slades. And ys sytuated in the terrytorye, whiche was sometyme of the Messenians, and was calledde Seraphasie. To thies reasones, the other two aunswered hyme, that yf he woulde grounde vpon y•, there were aboute Peloponese many promontoryes, that were desarte, whyche yf he wolde fortyfie, shulde be to make the cytie of Athenes emptye of monny. But neuerthelas he replyed vnto theme, that the same there was of an other ymportance, than the othere, for that, that yt had a good hauone, and moreouer that the Messenyans, that had some tyme kepte yt beynge sett into yt agayne, myght do greate annoyance and dyspleasueres vnto the Lacedemonyans, by cause of theire communycacyon of language, and shulde kepe the place dylygently and faithfully. And yet notwythstandyng, seynge that he coulde not perswade yt, nother to the souldyars in gennerall, nor wythe the Capytaynes, wythe whome he had debatede the matter a parte: at length he helde hys peace and dydd speake no more. But durnige the tyme that they tarryed theire ydle and vnoccupyede, attendynge that the sea was appeasedde, the souldyours deuysedde a gayne amonge themeself. And desyere tooke them to enclose the sayde place wyth walle, and so they determynedde to do yt. And hauynge no masons nor yrone tooles for to cutte the stones, they toke the

stones that they fonnde vpon the place, & sett them one vpon the other, so as they might best hewe them, and ioygned them togider with earth in stede of morter. And for that, that they had no baskettes nor other instrumentes for to carry it, they did beare it vpō their back. Holding their visage downe towards the groūd to the ende that they might carry it ye better. And for to kepe it there, they ioigned their handes behinde vpon their backes. and in effecte they vsed all industrie & diligence, that they coulde for to fortefie the place with sides, yt it might be assailed bifore that the Lacedemonians coulde send thider succoures. For on some sides it was not to be battred nor to be taken. Now ye Lacedemonians did celebrate a veary greate solempne feast in the cyte, whan they were aduertised of the same chaunce. through occasyon wherof, they did not greately passe on it. For it semed well to them that after they hadde acheued and fynished their feaste, whan they shulde go to that parte, that the ennemye woolde flye frome thence: or if they defended themsel
                     •
                  e, that they shulde take them veray easely. And on the other part, theire armye that was yet in the lande of Athenes, dyd somewhat retarde and slacke theym: in suche manner, that the Athenyans hadde respyte to fortefie the place on the lande side. And hauyng therin trauailled the space of sixe dayes, they left Demosthenes there wyth fyue galleys for to kepe it. And they with the other wente their way towardes Corcyre and towardes Sycille. During this tyme, the Peloponesians, that were in the lande of Athens, vnderstanding the takinge of Pylus, came agayne diligently into their lande. aswell for that, that it semed to the Lacedemonians and to Agis their kynge, that they had warre euē in their house, ye enemys being at Pylus as also for that they were entred to sone into y• lāde of Athens, to wyt, bifore ye corne was rype. through occasiō wherof, they had great lacke of victuailes. And moreouer the tēpests had bene, during the tyme yt they were there, more great, thā the season required. By meanes wherof, the men of warre were all troubled. wherby it happened, that though some other yeares, they had made no greate taryinge in that lande, yet that same yeare they made yt more shorte, for they taryed there, but fyftene dayes. In that same seasonne, Symonides, Duke of Athenyans, hauynge assembled a certayne small nomber of their menne of warre, that were in the garnysonne in the countreye of Thrace, and a good nomber of their allyes estrangers, toke by secrett contract, the towne of Eone in the countrey of Thrace. whyche was a Colonie or a towne founded by the Medes, but than was theire ennemy. Notwithstandynge the Chalcydes and the Beotyans, beinge aduertysedde of the case, came to the succoures of the towne, and fourthwyth dydde chase hym away wyth great losse of hys people. The Peloponesiās, being retourned out of the coūtrey of Athēs, the Spartains and their next neighbours assembled togiders incontinently for to go to recouer the place of Pylus. But ye other Peloponesians went not thider so sone. For that, that they were but newely come out of the countrey of Athens. And yet neuerthelas it was commaunded by generall decree & proclamacyon in all ye countrey of Peloponese, that euery man shulde sende to the succoures of Pylus, and also commaunded three skoore shyppes that were aboute Corcire, yt they shuld come to that partie. Which passing by the distreate of Leucade, vsed so good diligence, that they arryued at Pylus, bifore that the Athenyans shippes, that were at Iacinthus, did perceyue theym. And on the othere side by lande the armie of ye saide Peloponesians was there ready. But yet that notwithstandinge, bifore that the said ships arryued, Demosthenes had sent two brigantynes to Eurymedone, & to the other that were at the sayde place of Iacynthus, that they shulde comme to succoure him, shewynge hym the daunger, wherein he was. who, immediatly,

as they had the newes, toke their iourney for to come thider. Duringe this time, and bifore that they arryued, the Peloponesians prepared themself to assaile the place, aswell on the sea syde, as on that same by lande, trustynge to take it easely. bothe for that, that the walle was freshly & newly made, and also for that, that there were small nomber of people to kepe it. And yet neuerthelas for that they doubted that the shippes wyth Athenyans, that were at Iacinthus shuld come to succoure theym, they determynedde, if they coulde take the place before the succours came, for to inclose the entrye of tht hauon, in suche manner that the sayd Athenyans shippes shulde not enter therin, whyche thinge semed vnto them very easy to be done, for that, that there was directly against the rocke, wherupon was sytuated the place of Pylus, a small Islande named Factoria, whiche extended all alongest the hauon, and by that meane made the hauon suer. And neuerthelas the entringes therof was straight, so that on the towne side, where ye Athenians had made their rampars, there could enter but two ships on fronte, and on the other side towards the lande, eyght or nyne. which Island was holy baraine, & by that meane not inhabited, and in maner not frequēted, conteigning fiftene stades or forlonges aboute. Than for to empesche and stoppe the entrye of the sayd hauonne from the Athenians, they bestowed suche nomber of shippes ther, as they thought necessary for to occupy all the fronte. whiche had theire former parte of the hauonne and the remenant wythin. And moreouer fearynge that the sayde Athenyans shulde lande people wythin the sayde lytle Islande, they sette there one parte of theirs. And the other abodde in the lande, to the ende, that the ennemyes might not lande, nother in the land, nor in the Islande. And to the rest it was not possible to succour the place by any other wayes. For on ye other side, by the whiche it was enuironned wt the sea, there were no good depthes where the shippes mighte arryue surely. And by that meane they thoughte, that wythout faightinge and wythout puttinge themselfe into daunger and hazart, they might take that same place in shorte tyme, beinge ill furnished of victuailes and of people. Nowe they had ordeyned, that for to bestowe and putte wythin the sayde Islande, a certaine nomber of all the cōpaignies, shuld be taken, that shuld be changed euery daye. And so it happened, that the laste that were sente thyder, were to the nomber of foure houndred and twenty, of whome, Epitadas sonne of Molobee had the charge. Demosthenes, seinge that the Peloponesians prepared themselfe for to assaylle aswell by sea, as by lande, preparedde hymselfe to defende, And furste he causedde the galleys that remayned wyth hym to retyre vnder his rampares and inclosedde them wyth pales. And he armedde the maronners that were wythin them wyth mischeuous targottes or shieldes made in haste, the more parte of wyllos. For in suche a desarte place, there was no question or hope to haue armure. And the same that they had there, had bene gottone by force, from a galley and in a brigantine of the Messenyans, that they had takene, passinge that waye wyth forty men of the saide Messene, wyth whome they sarued themselfe at that nede wyth the othere. Hauynge than placedde one parte of hys people, aswell armed as naked, to the kepynge of the places ye were assured, by reasone that the place, was not to be gottone or gone vnto, and the other parte, that was greater, to the defence of the quartier that he hadde fortefied towardes the lande: he commaunded them, that if the fote men came to assayle them, they shulde defende themselfe and repoulse them. And he wyth thre skoore of the beste armed and a nomber of people wyth shott, issued de fourthe of the place, and wente oute on the sea syde, where he thought that the ennemyes wolde parforce themself for to lande and to passe through the rockes and harde

places: on whyche the walle of the towne was moste weake and feable, for to battre and breake it, it they coulde. For it was not greately forcedde to make a stronge walle on that syde, not thynkynge that the ennemyes shulde euer haue bene strongest by sea. And he knewe well, that if it were the strongest, so that men myghte by that coste goo into the lande, the place shulde be loste. For thys cause he wente to that syde of the sea for to defende yt, wyth the nomber of people as afore, whome he orderedde and sette battaylle, the beste that he coulde, and afterwardes dydde speake vnto theym in this manner.The ora

                     yon of Demosthenes. to his souldyars. It is nedefull for me that youe, the othere that be putte in thys daunger wyth me, do shewe youreself sage and dyligente to consulte all the difficultees and all the daungers, wherein wee be. But it is necessarye that we mynde to assaille valiantely oure ennemyes with a good couraige and wythe a good esperance to repoulse theym, and to escape frome all the daungers, wherein we be. Forsomuche as in all causes of necessitie, as thys same is at thys presente, men muste not oftymes serche after reasone, but they muste be soubdaynely hazardedde. And yet I doo see in oure affayre manye thynges that be for oure aduantage, if we wyll to stande to theym and forsake not, for feare of the greate nomber of oure ennemyes, the commodities, that we haue agaynste them. For I esteme one parte of the place that we holde to be, not to be comme vnto, and suffycyent for to ayde vs, if wee woll defende yt. But if we habandonne and forsake yt (howe dyffycyle and harde soeuer it be) it shalbe easye to wynne, not beynge defendedde. Trewe it is, that we shalle haue the ennemyes somuche more sharpe to fyghte wyth, if we sette on theym whanne they be landedde, for that they shall parceyue that they maye not retyre withoute greate daungier. But consyder youe, that soo longe as they abyde in their shippes wythout landinge, they be easely resistedde. And if they do lande, thoughe they be in greate nomber, they be not to be feared. Forsomuche as the place is very difficille and vneasy for them, and the platt, where they muste fight, shalbe ryghte strayght and very lytle. And by that meane, if they come on lande, the nomber shall in nothynge sarue theyme for the incommoditie and difficultie of the place. And if they tary vpon their shyppes, of force they muste fyghte in the sea in whyche fyght there be many difficulties. Wherfore I compense and esteme to be egall asmuch, the difficulties & dangers that they haue, as our smal nombre. For thys cause I praye youe (my frendes) that bringinge to youre remembrance, that youe be Athenyans, & lykewyse that you be people all experymentedde to fyght wyth shyppes and on lande: youe woll consyder that he that remoueth not for feare of a wawe or sourge of the sea that maye comme, nothere of shypp, that maketh vnto hym: shalle neuer be repoulsedde frome one suche a place as thys. And lykewyse that youe wyll stande by it and repoulse your ennemys in thies rockes and harde passages, and defende and kepe thys place, togyders wyth your parsones. The Athenyans discouraged, beinge recomforted by thies short encouraigings and declarations, disposed themselfe to defende euery one in his quarter. On the other syde the Lacedemonyans, that were in campe on the lande side, came to assayle the rampares, and on the sea syde, those that cō
                  ducted the shippes, whyche were .xliii. in nombere, wherof Thrasymelides,Thrasimelidas sonne of Cratesicles Spertayne was Capytayne, came to inuade the quarter, where Demosthenes was wyth his men. The Athenyans also defended themself very manfully on both sides. And as touchinge the quarter by sea, the Peloponesians came wyth small nomber of shippes by tournes or courses, one after the othere for that, that it was not possible to brynge thyder a greate nomber for to lande in the place, where Demosthenes & his people were for to repulse them, if it were

possible. And amonge othere Brasidas, who was Capytayne of one of the galleys, seynge that the place was difficile and daungerous to aboorde, and that for that cause the patrons of the galleys durste not approche, fearynge to bruse the vesselles: cryed wyth a lowde voice. It is greate shame to spare youre vesselles, where you see bifore your eyes those, whych haue fortefied yours, euen your lāde with walles. And commaunded them that they shuld rushe to lande, & in breakynge their said vessels, they shuld sett on their ennemys & not to be agreued to lose their shipps for to do saruice to the Lacedemonians, who had done them so many playsirs. But rather that they shuld fasten them on some parte that they might aboorde & going a land might wynne the place and the ennemys. Insayinge thies woordes, Brasydas constrayned the patrone of the galley, whertin he was, to rushe against the lāde. But parforcing himself to lāde by a plāke of a ship, he was by the Athenyans hurt in many places of his bodye, so that he felle backwarde amongeste the rowers, starke deade. But his shielde did fall into the sea, and afterwardes was caste by the wawes on lande. Whiche afterwardes the Athenyans dyd hange in the trophe or token, that they sett vp for that same victorye. The other Lacedemonyans had a ryght good wylle to lande, but it was tomuche daungerous, aswell for the difficultie of the place, as for the greate defence that the Athenyans made, wtout feare of any daungiers. And fortune was so farre ledde on both sides, that the Athenyans empesched or lettedde the Lacedemonyans to enter into their lande, or into that same, specyally of Laconia: and that those Lacedemonyans forced themselfe to lande in their proper lande, whiche was than in the handes of ennemys, though that in that season by the common reporte, the Lacedemonyans were more puissant and more exercysedde in fyghtinge by lande, and the Athenyans in the same by sea. And the same endured all that same daye and on parte of the daye followynge, not contynually, but at dyuers tymes. The thyrde daye the Peloponesians sent one part of their shipps into Asinus for to fatche woode and stuf for to make and rayse vppe a walle againste that same, that hadde bene made by the Athenyans aboute the poorte, trustyng, that they might by yt meane beate it downe wt Engynes or instruments, though yt were than hyghe, for that, that yt myghte be battredde on all sydes. But thys indurynge, arryuedde the succours wt shyppes of the Athenyans, that were at zachinthus, to the nombre of .lx. by meane that there were comme to the succurs somme frome Naupacte, and four frome Chio. whyche seinge the lande and the Islande shut or locked vp wyth fote men of the enemys and their ships, beinge wythin the poorte, not wyllynge to yssue fourthe, were in doubte what they shulde do. Yet they wente to ancre nighe vnto the desarte Island, and ther remaynedde that same daye. The morowe followynge they yssuedde into the mayne sea wyth all their shippes in battaille for to fighte, if the ennemys wolde haue yssuedde oute of the poorte, and for to sett vpon and assaille theym wythin that poorte, if they wolde not yssue fourthe. But those ennemyes, nothere yssuedde fourthe at large into the sea, nor also fournyshedde the entrynge of the poorte, so, as they hadde determined at the beginning. But wythout remouinge frome lande, replenishedde their shippes that were by the sea syde, and kepte themself all ready to fyght wyth them that entredde into the porte, whych was suffyciently greate. Whiche knowin, the Athenyans came wyth force of oores directly against them from sides of the entrynges of the poorte for to charge vpon the galleys of the sayd enemys that were formest in the sea, & soo dyd put them to flyght. And for that, that the place was strayght and narrow, they did breke one great parte therof & did take fyue, whereof one was takē wt the people in it.

And moreouer they pursued the other that were retyred towards the land, wher of they dyd breake some that were emptie, and fastened them, and caried them awaye wyth theirs in the sight of the Peloponesians. who, seinge that, and hauinge to great sorowe for that same losse, & specially that their people that were in the Islande, shulde be loste, did caste themselfe on their fete, all armed, as they were, into the sea and came to wythdrawe their shippes for to kepe them that ye Athenyans shulde not cary them away, with so greate courage, that it semed to euery one of them that al was lost, through his fault, if he wente not thider. And so the tumulte was great on both sydes. And in all partes newe and contrary to the accustomed manner, both on the one parte and on the other. For the Lacedemoniās through the fear yt they had to lose their people, did in maner, as to say, fight frō the land in the sea. And the Athenians for the desyre yt they had to ensue their victory, did fight out of their ships hand to hande, as though they had bene on lande. And fynally after a longe fight, wherin there was a greate nomber of dead & hurt men on both sydes, they retired and departed. And yet ye Lacedemonyens saued all their ships, except the fiue, that were taken at the beginning. And euery man beinge retourned into hys campe, the Athenians did restore vnto the other, their deade. And after sett vp a Trophe in signe of victory. And that done they enuironned and compassed aboute all the Islande wyth their shippes, wher in the four houndred & twenty Lacedemoniens were. whome they kept and did holde, as captyue and takenne. On the other syde, the Peloponesians that were from all partes arryuedde for to succour Pylus: kepte the towne assieged in the quarter towards land, whan the newes of this ouerthrowe were vnderstanded and declaredde at Sparte, it was determyned by the counsaille, that the officers of the cytie shulde go vnto the places for to viewe and descryue, and afterwards to aduyse what was to be done, like as they were accustomed to do, whan they had receyued anny greate losse. who hauinge viewed the whole, and considering that there was no remedy to succour their people that were in the Islande, and that there was danger lest that they shulde be aither takene, or dead through famyne, or by force: consyderedde the greate nomber of people that were agaynste theym they concluded to treate a peace wyth the Capytayne of the Athenyans. Duringe the whyche, those Lacedemonyans shulde sende vnto Athens, for to treate the appoinctement. Hopinge by that meane to recouer theirs. And soo the truse was accepted by the Athenyans vpon suche cōditions, that the Lacedemonyans shulde geue and delyuer them all the shyps, wherwyth they had foughte at Pylus, and all those that had bene there assembled out of all the countrey of Laconie, and that they shulde nother assayle nor doo annye dommage vnto the walles and ram

                  ares, whiche the sayd Athenyās had made at the sayd Pylus, by sea, nor by lande. And by this meane that the Lacedemonyans shulde suffre them to cary by sea vnto their people, that were in the Islande, dailly, a certayne quantytie of breade, of wyne and of fleshe. To wytt, somuch for euery free man, and the half for the sklaues, and as touchinge the fleshe to be at the discretion of the Athenyans. Withoute that, that it was liefull vnto them to carie thider, nor any shipp to passe thider, secretly. And yet neuerthelas that the Athenyans shulde kepe watche aboute the Islande, that none man shuld departe fromthence. But this notwythstandinge it shulde not be laufull for them to innouate any thing, nor to attempte agaynst the campe of the sayd Peloponesians by lande nor by sea. And in case, that of the one syde or of the other by anny manner, there chaū
                  ced any breache or contrauētion, great or lytle: the treuese shuld not be towards them vnderstanded to be broken. The whych shuld contynue vnto the rest, vntil

the Ambassadours of the Lacedemonyans shulde be retourned from Athenes. whome those same Athenyans shulde cary and bringe agayne with one of theire galleis. And at their retourne, the treuese shuld be vnderstāded to cease. In which case, the Athenyans shulde restore to the Lacedemonyās the ships that they had delyuered and geuenne them, in that self fourme, that they had receyued them. In this maner, the treuese was concluded, and in execution thereof, the Lacedemonyans delyuered to the Athenyans aboute .lx. galleys. And afterwardes the Ambassadours of the Lacedemonyans were sent vnto Athens. who beyng there aryued did speake vnto the Athenyans in the manner, as followeth.
            
            
               ¶The Oration of the Lacedemonyans to the Athenyans, and the aunswere that they had, and howe, the treuese failling, they beganne warre agayne. ☞The .ii. Chapter.
               THe Lacedemonyans haue sente vs hither (lordes Athenyans) for to appoinct & treacte of their people, that be in the Islande. Perswading themselfe that that, whych shal redounde to their proffit in this matter, shall also redounde to your honnour. And we woll not make vnto you longer oration, than we haue accustomed. For our manner of proceding is, not to vse many wordes, whereas is no great matter. And also whan the case and the tyme requireth it, we speake longer. to wytt, whan it is nedefull to shew by words, what is to be done. wherfore we pray you, that if we speke a lytle more longe, ye take it not to euill intent, & thinke not, that in shewing you, that youe shulde mynde to aduyse & consult well of the matter, wherof is question: that we go about to teache you what youe haue to do, as though we repute you ignorāt people. And for to come vnto the matter, it is in your power to make your great proffitt of that good aduenture and prosperytie, that is chaunced you by hauing our people in your power. For youe may therby acquire and gett greate glory & great honnor, if you haue regarde, not to do, as many do, yt haue not experymented, what is of goodnes & of euill. For whan a good aduenture had chaunced vnto them
                     •
                   vnloked for: they set their fantasie to greater thinges, trustyng that fortune shulde alwayes contynue. But those, that haue oftentymes experymented the varyation and chaunge of humayne chaunces, thinke most reasonably therof. And trust not somuch to the presente prosperyties. which thing is very cōuenient for your cytie, & also for ours, for the longe experyences of things, that they haue had. And although that youe vnderstāde it sufficiētly, yet ye se the experiēce therof in this presente case. For we that obteigne & haue presently the prync
                     •
                  pall authoritie & dignitie in all Grece, come hither for to demaūde of you that, which lately was more in our power to geue: as it semed vnto vs. And also we be not come to this inconuenient, through fault of men of armes, nother through presumption of our power. But (lyke as it happeneth in worldly chaūces) we haue bene frustrated & deceyued of our opynyon, in that, wherin all lyuinge creatures be egalle, to wytt, in thinges dependinge of fortune. wherfore it is not nowe nedefull, that for the present prosperytie and for the encrease of the puyssance, that hath chaunced you at this present: youe conceyue opynyon, that it ought to endure perpetually. For all saige and aduysed men do holde it for mooste certayne

that there ys nothinge so vncertayne, as worldely felicitie. and by this meane be alwayes more constant and determined to beare and endure all sinister chaunces and all euills. And so noo man shulde perswade himselfe, that it may be in his power, to make warre at his pleasure whan he thinketh good: but so as fortune permytteth him. And such people, as take not greater couraige for the prosperity that happeneth vnto them, faile not veray oftene. For that, that in the greate felicytie they be alwayes in feare. And if youe at this present do so vnto vs, truly ye shall fynde goodnes thereby. But if youe do yt not, but ra
                     •
                  ther refuse the parties that we do offer youe, and afterwardes any inconuenient do happene vnto you, such as may dayly chaunce, thincke not, that youe can kepe that, which you haue at this presente gottene. Where as youe may, if youe wil, leaue a perpetual memory of your puissance and of your prudencie. For youe see that the Lacedemonyans prouoke youe to make appoynctment and ende of warre, offeryng you peace, allyance, amytie and all other manner of familyaritie and benyuolence. In recompence of whiche thinges, they demaunde of youe theire people, that be in the Islande, and yt semeth to them that the same ys profittable to bothe parties. To witte, to youe for to exchue the hazarte by that meane, that maye followe, wheder that they saue themself, aither by any occasion and aduenture that maye happene: or if they be takene by force, to incurre a perpetuell enmytie, which cannot so easelye be quenchede. For that, that whan one of the parties, that maketh warre, ys constrayned, by the other, that hath had the better, and is founde to be strongest, to promys and swere any appoynctment for his aduauntage: suche appoynctemente ys not so firme and so durable, as yt shulde be, whan he, that hath had the victorie, being in his power of suche appoynctment, woulde graunte and agre to make yt honeste, and more modeste, than he, that had bene vaynquished, did hope of. For he, that perceueth curtoisie, woll not studie to breke his promys, as made for feare and constrayncte. But hauinge knowlaige of the curtesie, that the other hath vsed, he woll parforce hymselfe to kepe that well, which he shalle haue promysede, and shalle haue shame to faile thereof. And this same courtoisie vsed comonly the couragious men to them, that were moste puissant, raythere than towardes theym that were meaner or egalle wythe them. For it ys a naturelle thynge to pardone hym easelye, that renderethe and yeldeth him selfe wyth hys good wylle, and to persecute those, that be rebelles and oulteragyous, though that yt were not purposed, and that there myghte be dannger therein. Nowe, as touchynge thys presente chaunce, certaynelye: yt shall be a good and honnourable thynge, aswelle for youe, as for vs, yf we make nowe a good pea
                     •
                  e, better, than euer was in any tyme byfore, rather than we shulde receyue suche oultrage of youe, as by meane whereof, we be constrayned to beare vnto youe perpetuelle hatrede and rancoure, aswell in common, as in particuler, and that byfore that you lose the facultie to please vs wyth thynges, that we do requier of youe. Wherfore in the meane seasone whilest the yssue of the warre ys doubtfull, lett vs make, appoynctment. Youe, wyth youre greate glory and oure perpetuell beneuolences: we in excheuing a small shame, with an tollerable and meane losse. And sens that we haue chosene to haue peace, in steede of warre, we shall be cause to make an ende of all the greate euylles and trauailles in all Grece. Whereof they shalle geue youe the charge and the blame, if youe refuse this same. For vnto thys houre presente, they make warre withoute knowynge, who hathe bene the authoure or promotour thereof. Lykewyse, whan the appoynctemente shall be made (whiche ys nowe for the moore parte in youre power) they shall repute theym
                     •
                  elfe to be therefore bounden vnto youe. If youe

knowynge that it is in your facultie and power to make the Lacedemonyans (who require youe thereof) yo
                     •
                  re entier and perpetuall frendes, woolde chose to do vnto theym curtoisie, rather than rudenes. And consider, what goodnes may come therof, for as you knowe, whan this same bene accordedde by youe, all Grece, that is inferiour to youe and to vs, shall approue and ratefie yt. Thus spake the Lacedemonyans, thinkinge, that the Athenyans had bene before desirous of peace, if they myght haue obteigned it of them. And by thys meane that they shulde be all aised to haue yt, by delyueryng the people, that were in the Islande in their power. But the Athenyans, perswadinge theymselfe, that by receyuing of the sayd people assieged, they myght alwayes haue a better appoinctment wyth the sayde Lacedemonyans: they wold haue greater parties of them, chiefly through perswation of Cleon, sonne of Cleenetus, who had at that tyme greate authorytie among the people, and a great grace to speake. By whose opynyon, it was answered to the sayd Ambassadours, that furst & bifore all things, they, that were in the Islande, muste render themself wyth their armure, & shuld be brought prysonners vnto Athens, And that done, whan the Lacedemonyans had rendred vnto the Athenyans, Nyse, Pege, Trezene and the countreye of Achaie, whiche, they had not loste by warre, but by the former appoinctment, that they had made wyth the sayd Lacedemonyans, whan they were very lowe: had bene constraynedde to leaue and forsake them: the saide prysonners might be restored, and some reasonable appointment made to the contentacyon of both parties. The Lacedemonyans sayd nothinge against this answere, but they wylled certayne notable parsons to be deputed, wyth whome, they mighte debate vpon the hole matter. And afterwardes therin to be done, so, as shulde be aduysed by them to be reasonable. Wherunto Cleon did holy replye, sayinge, that he knewe well that they had not had nother than, nor bifore, any good quarell, sithēs that they mystrusted to debate bifore all the people, but wolde speake therof in small compaignie. wherfore he was of opynyon that if they hadde any thinge to speke (whyche they iudgedde to be reasonable) they oughte to speake it bifore all men. whiche the sayd Ambassadours wolde not do. For they did knowe well, that it was not liefull nor conuenyente for them, for to speake bifore all the people. And also for that
                     •
                   that in so doinge, if hauinge regarde to theire nec

                  ssitie, and to the daunger wherin their people were, they woulde ha
                     •
                  e consentedde to any thinge disaduantagious vnto them, they parceyued well, that comminge to the knowlaige of their allyes, it shulde engender greate displeasure vnto them. wherfore, knowynge that they coulde not obteigne of the sayd Athenyans any reasonable thynge, they departed from Athens, wythout any conclusion. After their departure, the treuese were incontynētly expyred that were made at Pylus. By reason wherof, the Lacedemonyans demaunded that the Athenyans shulde render to them the shippes, that they had delyuered by the treatie of the treuese according to that, whyche therby was appoyncted. But the said Athenyans refused that to do, sayinge, that the sayd Lacedemonyans had done agaynste the sayde treatie, forsomuche as they had made assaultes vpon the garnysons of the sayd Athenians. And charged theym wyth some thynges, where there was no apparance of raysonne, but all theire foundation and grounde was for that, that in the sayde treatie it was concluded, that if one of the partyes dyd fayle or do againste anny thinge therin, howe lytle soeuer yt was, that they shulde not helpe themself with the sayd treatie. And whatsoeuer declaration or doleaunce that the sayd Lacedemonyans coulde make for to shewe that it was agaynst all reasone, and against the fayth, whych they had promysed, yet they coulde obteigne none other thing.

And so they prepared thēself to warre, on both sydes. And made all their strēgthe for the feate and affaire of Pylus. In whyche place the Athenyans kepte twoo galleys for ordenary watche, aboute the Islande both day and nyghte, compassinge it aboute at all tymes, whan the wynde was not vehement and highe, for than they kepte themself on the shoore of the sea. And also there was sente afresh, to thei
                     •
                   succours and strength, twenty other galleys, so that they were in all .lxx. On the other side the Peloponesians had their campe in the firme lande, and assailled oftentymes the walles of the towne, and also espyed and wayted contynually, if they might haue any meane to saue their people, yt were in the Islande.
            
            
               Of thinges that were done after that tyme in Sycile, aswell by the Athenynyans and theyr allyes, as by them of the contrary parte. ☞The .iii. Chapter.
               AFter the tyme that the thinges were so done at Pylus, as we haue wryttonne: the Syracusains and theire allyes in Sycille, hauinge afreshe strengthened their armye by sea wyth shippes (which they had made all newe) and also wyth those, that the Messenyans hadde sente them, made them warre from the same place of Mysena agaynst the Regians, at the sollicitinge and pursute of the Locryans. who, for the ennymytie that they had agaynste them, were nowe entred into their coūtrey wyth all their puissance by lande. And it semed to the sayd Syracusains that it was expedyente to assaye and proue the fortune of the battaylle by sea, for that, that the Athenyans hadde not at that tyme any greate nomber of shippes in Sycille. But it was to bileue that after that they vnderstode, that those Syracusains did enforce thēselfe agayne, to subdue all the Islande, they woulde sende thider a greater nomber. wherfore they thought, that if they had the victorie by sea (as they hoped) they myght easely gette the towne of Rhege, afore that the succours of the Athenyans shulde be comme, assailinge it by sea, and by lande. And that done, holdynge the sayd cytie of Rhege, whiche standeth vpon a rocke or promontory on the sea, frome the coste of Italie, and kepynge Myssena, whyche is dyrectly agaynste yt on the other syde of the sea, in the Islande of Sycile: they mighte easely defende, that the Athenians shuld not passe through the distreate of Far: that separateth Italy, from Sycile, whyche is called Charibdis. And it is saide that Ulysses passed that same way, commynge from Troye. And not wythout cause it is so named, forsomuche as it falleth ympetuously and furyously, through the straites, that be betwene the sea of Sycille, and the sea named Thirrene. And the Syracusains came thider aboute night, wyth their allyes, hauynge in al a few more, than thirty shippes
                     •
                   for to geue the battaille, to the Athenyans, who hadde .xvi. of theirs and eyght of the Rhegyans. But the Athenyans had the victorie. And did putt the Syracusains to flyght. Who saued themself euery man the best that he coulde at Myssena. And yet neuerthelas there was no losse, but of one only ship, by reasone that the night departed them. And after that same victory the Locrians, that kepte their campe bifore the cytie of Rhege, dyd rayse it vp, & retourned into their countrey. But sone after, the Syracusains and their allyes assembled agayne theire shippes and wente into Pelloride, whyche is in the terrytorye of Myssena, hauynge there their fotemen. At whyche place, beynge also aryued the

Athenyans and Rhegyans, and seinge the sayd ships of the Syracusains voide, th

                  y came to assaille them. But hauing entred one of the same, and fastened it to one of theirs wt graspes of yrone they loste theirs, howbeit the people that were within it did saue themself by swymmynge. And although that as the Syracusains that were nowe entred within it, did make towardes Myssena, the Athenyans came a freshe to assaile them, thinkinge to recouer the shyp, yet they were bea
                     •
                  en of and repoulsed, and also loste one othere of their shippes. And by thys meane the Syracusains, though that they had bene vainquished at ye other battaile, wythdrewe themself with their honnor vnto Myssena, wythout hauynge more losse, than the ennemyes. And the Athenyans retired vnto Camerin, being aduertysed that a burgeois of the towne, named Archias,Archias wyth hys accomplices, wold rēder that same towne fro the Syracusains. In thies countrechaunces al the people of Messena yssued fourth, aswell by sea
                     •
                   as by lande for to go againste the cytie of Naxe, in the countrey of Chalcyde, whyche is in the terrytorye o

                   the sayd Messanyens. And the Naxians,Naxus. beinge the furst day yssued to mete them by lande, they were repulsed vntill wtin their portes. And the Syracusains did geue themself to pillage their landes aboute the towne, afterwardes, they assieged yt. And on the other side, the morowe following, those that were in the sea, sailed for to aryue, at the ryuer of Acesine,Acesine. where they lāded, and made a great pray in that same quarter. whych 
                     •
                  arceyued, the Sycilians, that kepte themself in the mounteignes, assembled togider and came to discende into the countrey of Mamertayns: and frothence they came for to succour ye said Naxians. who, after that they parceyued them cōmyng, recouered their courage, & they, exhortinge the one the othere, thynkyng that it had bene the Leontyns and other Grekes dwellinge in Sycille that were come to succour them, they issued afreshe out of the towne wt such 
                     •
                  trength, that they caused the Mamertayns to flye & dyd slay of them, more than a thousand, and the other had much payne for to saue theymselfe. For the straungers and paysans, that kept the wayes & passages, did kylle many of them. And the shippes, that were retyred vnto Messene, saylledde euerye one into hys quarter. through occasion wherof, the Leontyns and their ally
                     •
                  s wyth the Athenyans, enterprysed to assiege Messena. For that, that they well parceyued, that it was sore decayed. And so the Athenyans came by the one syde of the sea to assiege the walles. But the Messenians, with a bende of Locryans, that was remayning there, for to kepe the cytie vnder the conducte of Demoteles,Demoteles. sett vpon them, as they were in the lande
                     •
                   put them to flight, and so did slaye many of them. whyche seynge, the Athenyans yssued out of their shippes for to comme to succour them. And charged vpon the Mamertyns, in suche sorte, that they repoulsed, and dyd dryue them backe euen into the the towne. Afterwardes, leauynge their trophee for a signe of victorie, they retourned to Rhege. After that, ye Grekes, that inhabyted Sycille, wythout anny ayde of the Athenyans, prepared and gaue themself to make warre, thone agaynst thoder.
            
            
               Howe the Athenians hadde the victorie at Pylus. ☞The .iiii. Chapter.
               THe Lacedemonyans than holdinge theire siege bifore Pylus, and their people wythin the Islande being assieged by the Athenyans, like as hathe bene aboue declaredde, the armye of the Athenyans was in greate perplexytie and necessytie of victuailles, and of freshe water.

for there was but one onely well, which was in the toppe and height of ye towne of Pylus, whiche was also very smal. In such maner, that they were constrayned to dygge at the ebbyng of the sea, wythin the sande. Whereout they dyd drawe suche water, as might be drawin out of suche a place. and as for the rest, the place where they kept their campe on lande, was veary small. and the shyppes were not seure in the rode. By meane wherof, some of them kept along the land for to recouer vyctua
                     •
                  les, and the other dyd ancre in the meane sea. And moreouer they had greate displeasur and werynes, for that that the affayre indured longer, than they thought, frome the begynnynge that yt shuld haue done. For they thought ernestly that those that were wythin the Islande, not hauynge vyctua
                     •
                  les nor freshe water, coulde not so longe defende yt, as they dyd, by the prouysion that the Lacedemonyans dyd ordeyne for to succour them. Who dyd yt to be knowin by publique and open proclamacyon, that whosoeuer wolde carrye to them that were wythin the Islande, meate, breade, wyne

                   he were a bondeman he shulde haue lybertye. By meane wherof, many dyd put themselfe in daunger to carry yt thyder. And cheifly the sklaues, for the desyre that they had to acquire and gett lybertye. And they passed by the sea of Peloponese, into the sayde Islande by all meanes that they myght. and the more parte by nyghte, and by y• coste of the meane sea, and pryncypallye whan the wynde came frome the sea agaynste the land. For by the same, they came easely wythout beynge perceyued by the gallyes of the ennemyes, that kepte the wa

                  che, for that that they coulde nott well kepe aboute the Islande, whan that same wynde reygned. And for them, that came vnto the Islande, yt was aduantagyous on that syde, for that that yt chased them vnto yt. And moreouer they, that were wyth
                     •
                  n the Islande, reyceyued them in armure. But all they, that aduentured themself to go thyd

                     •
                   of the sea, that passed vnder the water from the poorte, vnto wythin the Islande. And they toke them wt a corde, made wythin of goate skyns & paper grynded wt honny and stamped wyth lyne sede. wherewythe they o

                   the Islande repastedde themselfe and dyd so, longe byfore the Athenyans perceyued yt. But at lengthe parceyuynge yt, they sett there watches. And for effecte, euery one for hys parte vsed the beste dylygence, that he myght, to wytt, the one to b
                     •
                  ynge vyctuailes into the Islande, and the other for to empesche yt. In thys meane tyme the Athenyans that were in the cytie, vnderstandynge that their people whyche were asseged at the sayde place of Pylus, were in greate necessytie, a
                     •
                  d that those, that were in the Islande hadd vyctuailes, they were in greate care. For they doubted, that by the wynter, that came vpon them, their people shulde suffer muche, beynge in a desarte place, for that, that in that tyme yt shulde be veary harde to compasse aboute all Peloponese for to vyctuaile them. And yt was nott posseble in that tyme of sommer that remayned and was to come, to furnyshe theme of all that, that was necessarye for their suffysance. Also their shyppes had no
                     •
                  her porte nor abydinge place, where they myght be in suertye. On the other syde, they parceyued well that whan they shulde dyscontynue and cease the watche aboute the Islande, they that were wythin yt, wolde saue themself in the same shippes that carryed them vyctuailes, espyinge the tyme, whan the sea shulde be roughe. And the thynge moste that they feared, was that they thought that the Lacedemonians, parceyuynge themselfe to haue the aduantage, woolde sende vnto theme no more to d
                     •
                  maunde peace. Wherefore they repented thems
                     •
                  lfe ryght soore, not to haue accepted yt
                     •
                   whan they required it. And forsomuch as Cleon parceyued well that they had opiniō that he had bene cause of empesching it, he said yt the affaires

of tharmye was not in suche sorte, as they were done to be vnderstanded. And for that, that they, that had made reaporte, demaunded that men might be sent thider to parceue the trouth, it was determyned that he & Theogenes shuld go.Theogenes. But Cleon, parceuing that if they so did, they shuld be forced aither to say, as the furst: or that sayinge the contrary, they shuld afterwardes be foūde lyars: he perswaded the people, whome he sawe well animated to that battaile, to sende some strength of people, aboue the nōber, that they had determyned. Saying yt it was better to do so, than to lose tyme by tarying for them, yt shuld be sent, vntill they were retourned. For in the meane time if it were so as the other did say, ye freshe strength, that shulde be sent thider, might be arryued. And forsomuche as Nycyas, sonne of Nyceratus, who had ye cōduct & the charge of that army that was at Pylus, was his enemye: he said that if, sending that same succours, they yt had the charge of that affaire, were men of courage, they might easely take them, that were in ye Islande, & that if he were there, he doubted not, but that he wolde 
                     •
                  one do it. Than Nycias, parceyuinge that the people had nowe conceyued some displeasure wt the said Cleon, for that, that if he did knowe the thinge so easye as he said, they thought yt he shuld not refuse to go thider: and also seinge that the said Cleon charged him, he said vnto him. That insomuch as he founde the thinge to be easy, it were good, that he toke the charge to leade the rēforte or freshe strēghe 
                     •
                  hider. And he remitted vnto him his place & hys puissance right wyllingly. And Cleon, thinking at the begynnynge that he did it not with good harte & ernestly, but iudgynge, that he wolde not do it, did not refuse it. But aftere that he parceyued, that the other perseuered, he excused himself, saying yt the other was chosene Capytaine for that, and not he. Notwythstandinge whan the people did see, that Nycyas wolde wythout any fayninge leaue his charge to the sayd Cleon & prouoked him to take it,Nycyas (as euery cōmonaltie is ioyeful of a nouation & change) they commaunded the sayd Cleon to accepte it. who seinge that there was noo remedy to forsake it, sens that it was so offredde: he fynally accepted it. And said right gloriously, that he feared not the Lacedemonyans, and that he wolde goo thider wtout taking one man of Athens. But he wold cary the soldyars of Lemne and Imbricie, whiche were than in the cytie, all well armed, and some othere armed wyth targattes, whyche were sente from Ene, with a certayn nomber of Archers, whome he wolde take in other places, to the nomber of foure houndred. Wyth the which, and those that were already at Pylus, he auaunted himself that wtin twenty daies, he wolde bryng the Lacedemonyans that were in the Island, prysonners into Athens, orels wolde slaye theym. At whyche so glorious speakinge, the Athenyās did laughe: and yet they were glad therof, thinking yt one of two things shuld happene: aither that they shuld by yt meane be delyuered from the importunitie of Cleon, who was tedyous vnto them already, if he failled to do the thynge, wherof he auaunted hymself (as the moste parte thoughte, that yt shuld so be) orells if he did it, that he shuld bringe the Lacedemonyans into their power. Beinge than the thinges so deliberated and concluded in the assemblie of the common people, Cleon was by the voyce & opynyons of them chosene, made and created Empereur and Capytayne of the armye, in stede of Nycyas. And he named Demosthenes to be his adioyned compaignyon, who was in the campe, for that, that he parceued that he was of opynyon to go to assayle, wtin the Islāde, those, that were there. Also the souldyours, seyng the incommodytie of the place, and that they were more assieged, than those, whiche they did assiege, desired to hazarde the matter. And this also gaue them couraige therunto, that they parceued the Islāde to be already discouered in many places, where the woodes were

burned. whiche at the beginning, whan the siege was there layde, it was so thick with woode, by reason that no man had haunted it, that it was in a manner impossible to passe through it. whyche was the cause whye Demosthenes feared at the begynning to enter into it. For it semed vnto him, that it was the aduaūtage of them, that were wythin. for somuche as whan he had landed there wyth great puissance those, that were within hydde & in couert in dyuers places mighte doo greate dōmaiges to hys people, whyche he coulde not do vnto them that were hid through the wood, and dyd know ye passages & paths therof. And by yt meane the faults that his people shuld cōmyt, shuld be discouered. In suche maner, yt it shuld be in ye facultie & power of the enemys to yssue fourth of their embushmēt & come to assaile them whan they did se their aduaūtage. And though that they were repoulsed into ye thick woode & being but a smal nōber, yet shuld they haue the aduaūtage, for the knowlaige, which they they had of the place. And moreouer a certain nōber of the people that he had, could not cōme there, wher the greatest busynes shuld be. nother there, where succours shulde be set, for thimpeschement of the wood. And besides all thies reasons, that moued Demosthenes, yet the ouerthrowe, whych he had at Ethiole, whiche chaunced him partely by lyke occasiō of woode, caused him mooste to feare. But it was happened, that some of of them yt were wtin the I
                     •
                  lande, being come to the shore for to watche: did kind
                     •
                  e a fyer for to sethe their meate, & that the wynde so arysed, that it kindled ye same fyer, in such sorte, that it did burne very farre into the Islāde. By meane wherof, Demosthenes parceiued yt there was a greater nōber of people, than he thought. And seing also, yt thentrie shuld be more easie by meane of the said fier, he thought it beste to assaile them, as sone as he might, and so he prepared to do it, & had already cōmaunded them that were next the Island, to come to his ayde. And in ye meane tyme he was aduertysed, by Cleon, that he had the charge of the army, & so he attended for him. And whan he was come, after that they had aduised togiders, they sent an heraul
                     •
                  e to the Lacedemonyās that were in the campe bifore ye towne, for to knowe of them, if they would be content, to cause

                  hose, that were in the Island, to render themself wt their armure, vnder cōdition, that they shuld be well & suer

                  y kept, vntill the tyme that it were determyned vpon thappoictement for all the warre. And vnderstanding by reporte of the heraulte, that they wold not accept the sayd partie they seiourned & taryed therupō, one whole day. And afterwardes cōminge the night, they bestowed the most parte of their people wtin a 
                     •
                  mall nōber of ships. whome, they dyd sett wtin the Island about dawning of the day on both sides to wit, on the syde of the hauone, & of the same of ye mayn sea. One part of whyche nōber, vnto eyght hoūdred or therabout incontynētly as they were lāded, did ronne wt most diligēce yt they could, against the chiefest that kept watche that same nyght, whiche were about thirty. For the othere were ye m
                     •
                  st part in a place discouered, which was in a maner, in the middest of the Islāde enuironed wt water & Epitadas their captain wt them. One other part was at the other end of the Islāde on the side frō Pylus, which could not be assailed by the sea side, for that, yt the Island was on that side high & s
                     •
                  iepe vp, in suche maner, yt no man could skalen or enter there. And on the towne side it was vneasie to assaile, by cause of an olde castell that had somtime bene there made wyth a raw wall. which they wtin the Islande resarued for their forte. if they were constraigned to habādone & forsake the reste. The affaires than being in this estate, as aboue, those that came to charge vpō the watche, came soubdainlp vpō them & found thē sleping, so that bifore they could arme thēself, they were all slayne by meane that they feared not their lāding. And though that they had parceued the

galleys to compasse aboute the bankes & coastes of the Island, yet they thought that it had bene those, yt kepte the watche, as they had nightly accustomed. After that, whan the daye beganne to be clere, the rest of the army, that was yet the in the shipps whyche were arryued at the Islande, that were to the nomber of foore skoore or theraboute, landed all in the Islande. To wytt, those whiche were at the furste siege, and those, that Cleon had brought, those resarued, that were lefte to kepe the campe and the munityons. Amonge whome, there was about eyght houndred Archers and as many caryinge targattes lightly armed, whyche Demosthenes did appoincte all in that same sorte. For he did sett theym in dyuers bendes, the one distant from the othere, at two houndred men for the bende, & in some parte lesse accordinge to the capacytie of the places. And he caused theym to gette euery where the hyghest of the place for to do the mooste displeasure to the ennemys. Compassing them on many sydes, to the ende, that they shuld not knowe on what parte to tourne themself for the great multitude of people, that they shulde see charged vpon them on all parties. For if they tournedde agaynst them, that assaylled them at their backe: they that were afore them, wold ronne vpon them. And the lyke thinge did those that were behinde, if they marchedde agaynste them that were afore. And whan they tournedde vpon them that were on the sydes, they were assailled both by those from afore, and also by those, that were behynde. And by that meane on euery parte where they tourned, they were alwayes compassed behynde wyth those that were lightly armedde. who didde attainct and sett vpon them incōtynetly. And the Archers did hurte them afarre of wyth arrowes, wyth dartes, wythe stones, caste wyth hande, and with slinges. And also they kepte not their standinge whan men charged on them. For it is their custome to vainquishe by flyinge, for that, that they did shote and caste without cessinge. And whan the ennemys did retourne, they were at their backe. Suche order dyd Demostenes kepe, aswel at the entry into the Islande, as also after that he was entred, in all that same fyght. whan Epitadas and those that were wyth him in middes of the Islande, whiche was the greatest nomber, parceued that their watche, and those that were in the former strength were discomfyted, and that all the company came hastely agaynste them, they dyd putt thē
                  self in battaille, and wolde haue marched agaynste the Athenyans that came in the fronte bifore them. But they coulde not come hande to hande, nother shewe their valyantnes against them. For the Archers & throwers, and those that were lightly armed, who came on the sydes and wynges, did empesche them. wherby, they parceyuynge that, marched not against the sayd Athenyans. But kept them selfe in theire order and remoued not, but whan the said light armed did approche nighe vnto them. For than they repoulsed them, but in their flyinge they alwayes defended them, and so were dryuen to saue themself through the rockes and straight places, and the Lacedemonyans that were strongly armed, coulde not followe them. In suche sorte they didde fyghte a certayne space of tyme, in maner of a escharmushe. And afterwards the light armed, parceyuinge that the Lacedemonyans were already wery and slowe to follow them so oftene, did take more couraige and a
                     •
                  dacytie, and shewed themself in greater nomber, for that, that they founde not the Lacedemonyans so sharpe nother so vaillyant, as they thought them to be at begynnyng, whan they were entred into the Islande. For than they wente muche in greate feare agaynst them, for the greate renomme of their hardynes, and so they rushed wyth greate cryes, all at ones vpon them, castynge arrowes stones and othere shotte, suche as they hadde euerye one in his hande. At whyche crye and manner of combate and fighting, the Lacedemonyans,

who hadde not bene therunto accustomed, were all astonied. And on thoder parte, the powder of the ashes, that came from the places where ye fyer had bene, was so greate in the ayer, that they coulde nother see, nor by any meane auoyde the shot that was cast agaynst them. In maner that they were in great perplexitie. For theire sallettes and cappes of yrone coulde not couer them fro the shott, theire speares were brokene and frushed wyth stoanes that were caste agaynste them, and moreouer they beynge enuyroned and assayled on all sydes, dyd nott see those, yt assailed them, nother they coulde heare what thinge they were commaunded to do, for the greate crye yt thennymys did make. So that they knewe not what to do, and also did not se any meane to saue themselfe. Fynally ye more parte of them being alreadie hurt, they retyred all togeders towardes the castell, whiche was in the ende of the Islande, where there was one part of thair people. whiche parceyued by the light armed, they approched yet more boldely withe greate cryes and strokes of shott, and those that departed fro the trowpe, were slayne incontynently. But one great parte saued them self through the woodes, and came to ioygne wyth them, that were at kepynge of the castell. And all togeder prepared themselfe for to defende that syde thereof, that was assaultable. The Athenyans followed theym veary nighe. And neuerthelas seyng that they coulde not assiege the place on all sydes, for ye nature & dyficultie therof, bestowed them selfe in a place more higher. Fromewhence wyth force of shott, and by all meanes that they could, they parforced themself to chase ye other out of the castel. But they defended themself veary hardely. In such sorte that the combate endured the greater parte of one day. Through occasion wherof, they were all ouercommed of the one part and of the other, wyth heate, drough and trayuaile. For the Lacedemonyans, had meane and power to defend themselfe, for that, yt they coulde not be enuyroned nor assayled by the sydes. The matters, beyng in thies termes, and the duke of Messenyans, seyng that there was no ende, came vnto Cleon and to Demosthenes and sayde vnto them that they trayuailed themself in vayne to thincke to take thennymies in that same sorte. But yf they delyuered hym a certayne nomber of footemen lightly armed and of Archers, he wold take payne to enter secreatly vpon the ennymies at their back in some maner. Whiche thing they dyd graunt hym. Who, hauyng the people that he had demaunded, ledde them the most secretly that he coulde throughe the rockes and through ye brokene places of the Islande, tournyng vntill he came to the quarter, whyche was not kept nor defended, for that, that yt semed to the Lacedemouyans, that yt defended yt self, by yt self, & wythe the most payne of the worlde, he mounted & skaled vp to ye height. Wherby, the Lacedemonyans, seing them to be taken behynd them, were greatly astonyd & in maner withoute hope. And ye Athenians, yt assailed them afore, did all reioyce, as certayne of the victory. In this estate the Lacedemonyans founde themselfe enclosed & slayne on all sydes, as those, whiche did fyght agaynst Perses at Thermopiles, if comparyson may be made of grete thinges, vnto small. For as those, being there surprised by smal passages & paths of the moūteigne on all sydes, were al slayn: so thies, being here hurt on all parts, defended themself no longer. But perceyuing themself in so small nōber agaynst so great nōber of enemis, & being moreouer faint & ouercōme wt famine, droughe and wyth trauaylle: lefte and habandonned the defenses. In suche māner, that the Athenyans had nowe already gottone all the entrynges of the place. whych sene by Cleon & Demosthenes, & that, howmuch the lesse they defended thēself, so muche ye greater nōber of thē was slain: they caused their people to retire, desiring rather to cary thē, yt were yet lyuinge prysoners vnto Athens, if they wold render

themself to their wil, than to slay them. And so they caused them to be sōmoned by the herault with a lowde voyce to do it. And whan one partie did caste on the grounde their shielde clappinge theire handes, whyche was a tokene, that they accepted the partie. And so made treuese for a small space. Duringe the whiche, they came to parliament, to wit, Cleon & Demosthenes for the Athenyans, and Styphō of Pharacie for the Lacedemonyās, for that, that Epidatas, yt had bene their capitaine was deade, and Hippagretus, who was chosen in his stede, was hurte and lay on the groūde among the dead, though that he was yet liuing
                     •
                   For thys cause had the same Hippagretus bene chosene after the lawe and custome of the Lacedemonyans for to ordeyne and commaunde according to the chaūce and as nede shulde require. who, beinge comme to the parlyamente with the said Cleon and Demosthenes, sayde vnto them on the bihalf of them that were with him and of his, that bifore accepting the partie, they would therin haue the aduyse of their capytains & compaignions, that were in the mayne lande. And seing that the Athenyans wolde not agre vnto it, they called wyth a lowde voyce, the heraults that were wyth their said Capytains in the mayne land. And after that they had called thre tymes, one of the sayd heraulds came vnto them vpō a ladder, who shewed them from the other, that they shuld
                     •
                   denyse and take partie in their affaire themself, so alwayes that they shulde not make anny shamefull appoinctement. And therupon hauynge consulted amonge them what they had to do, they rendred thēself wt their armure to the pleasure of the enemys. & were all that night & the day folowing, kept as prysoners. The other day after, the Athenyans hauynge sett vp their trophee in the Islāde in token of victorie, departed the saide prisoners amonge the bendes, delyuerynge them in kepynge vnto the Capytaynes of that same bendes. And afterwardes preparedde themselfe to retourne vnto Athens. And rendred to the Lacedemonyans (who for that cause had sent their heraulte) the corpses of the dead. And of all the nōber o

Of the Athenyans there was no great nōber slayne, for that, that there was no ranged battaille. The tyme, that the sayd Lacedemonyās had bene in the Islāde, f

The rest of the time, they liued wt that, that was brought them secretly. And so there was founde in their campe wheate & othere victuailes, which they had yet in stoare. For Epitadas departed them so, as was requisitt for the necessitie. In this manner departed the Athenyans and the Lacedemonyans frō Pylus, and euery one wēte to his house
                     •
                   And the promes, that Cleō had made yt to Atheniās at his departure (though it were folish & glorious) was parfourmed & accomplished. For he broughte the ennemyes prisonners to Athens within the space of twenty dayes, lyke as he had promysed. whiche was the furste thynge that happened in that warre agaynst the opinyō of all the Grekes. For they neuer thought, that the Lacedemonyās, nother for famyne nor for other necessitie, that they might haue: wolde haue rendred their armure. But rather than they wold do that, to fyghte vntill the death. And if those that yelded themself hadde bene lyke vnto them that hadde bene slayne, they hadde not bene so rendredde. whereby it thereupon chauncedde after that they were brought to Athens, that one amonge them beinge asked by an Athenyan, in manner of derysion and mockage, if those that were slayne of theire compaignie, were people of estymacyon: he aunsweredde hym in thys manner. That the distaff was muche

to be made of, if it knewe men of honestie, wylling by the distaff to signefie the arowe and shott. And to say, that those that were dead of their cōpaignions, were slayne by strokes of shot so as they came at aduenture. wherefore it coulde not be iudged if they dyed villaynously or no. Being than the sayd prisoners brought to Athens, it was ordeyned that they shuld be kepte in good prysons vntill that some appoinctement were takene wyth the Peloponesians. And if in the meane seasone, they came to ouerronne their lande, that they shulde be all slayne. To the reste the Athenyans did leaue their garnysone at Pylus. And moreouer the Messenyens sente thider from Naupacte, some of their people, suche, as they thought moste conuenient and mete for to be in that same place. For that, that whā Messena was in his entier, that same place, was of his terrytorye. And they that kept it, were robbars and theues, and wente pillinge and robbing the countrey of Laconie, and did there many other mischeues, somuche more easie, for that they did speake one self language. Of thys warre, the Lacedemonyans were astonied, for that they they were not accustomed to make it of like sorte. And also of this, that their sk

                  aues rendred themself to the ennemys. So they sente secretely Ambassadours to the Athenyans for to vnderstande and knowe if 
                     •
                  hey might recouer Pylus and their prysonners. But the Athenyans, who desired and affected greater thinges, after mamy goynges and commynges, sente them agayne wythout doynge any thynge. This ende hadde the affayres at Pylus.
            
            
               ¶ Of a victorie that the Athenyans hadde agaynste the Corynthians in their lande. ☞The .v. Chapter.
               INcontynetly after that victorye, that same sommer, the Athenyans wente agaynst the countrey of Corynthyans wyth foore skoore galleis, caryinge a thousand fotemen, all Athenians. And in the other plat ships, they caryed two houndred warryours, beinge hoorsemen. And besydes this, they had in their compaignie the succours of Milesyans, of Andryens and of Caristians.Andrii. Of the whyche armye, Nycias,Nicias. sonne of Nyceratus, wyth two other compaignyons, was capytain. So they kept along the lande betwene Cherronese and Rhite.Cherronesus. And parceued themself at dawning of the day to be foranempste one small mountaigne, named, Soligius.Solygius. Whyche, hauynge in tymes paste bene fortefyed, by the Doryens, made there from warre againste the Eolyans, that were wythin the cytie of Corinthe. And there is at this presente daye a Castelle, that hath the selfe name of the mounteigne, whiche is distant frome the sea syde, wherby the galleys did passe, aboute twelue stades. from the cytie of Corinthe, aboutes thre skore, and from the distraict, twenty. To whyche distreate, the Corynthians that were aduertised of the comminge of the Athenyans, were all gone, resarued those, that inhabited wythout the sayd destroycte, on the coste of the fyrme lande. Wherof sixe houndredde were gone into Ambracya and into Leucade for to defende them. The other were al gatheredde togiders to deskrie, in what quarter the Athenyans wolde lande. But those same Athenyans, being in the night passed by, wythout parceyuinge, and vnderstandinge (by the signes that they, whyche were in the watche did make, that they were landed on the other syde of Soligius) they parted themself into two bendes, wherof they didde

leaue the one in Centhrea for to succour Crommyon, if the said Athenyans dyd come to assaile yt, and the other halfe wente to the succours of the other
                     •
                   vpon ye coste, where the saide Athenyans were landed. Nowe had the Corinthians made twoo Capitaynes of that warre. Whereof they did name the one Battus, who was gone wyth one bende for to enter into the castell, whiche was not stronge of walles, for to defende yt: and thother, named Lycophron, went agaynst the Athenyans that were landed. And marched at ye arryuall, agaynst ye right poynct and wyng of the Athenyans, with whome were the Caristiens in the laste bende. and so he assayled them lyuely, and the battaile was veary sharpe euen hand for hand. But fynally, the Corinthians were repulsed vnto the mountaigne, where there was plentie of heapes of stones, of the walles beaten downe. Frome which place, hauynge the aduauntage, they repulsed thennemyes wyth greate strokes of stones. And after yt the sayd ennemyes had retyred and recouered theire brethe, they caused their trompetts to sounde, and descended afresh agaynst them. And so byganne agayne the battaille hand to hande more sharpe than the furst. But they being in the most heate therof, came to ye succours of the sayd Corinthians, one compaignie of their people. By whose helpe, they repoulsed the Athenyans vntyll the sea, where the Athenyans afreshe ioygned themselfe togiders and repoulsed the Corinthians. In the meane tyme, the rest of the people dyd combate

So they retyred into their ships wyth the spoyle of their ennemyes and the corpses of theire people, that were slayne: excepte twoo, whyche they coulde not fynde nor knowe.

Beinge at whyche place, they issued fourth with them of the towne against the other cytezeins, that were dryuen and chased fromthence. who, beynge fortefied in the mounte Isthone,Isthone had gottone al the countreye about ye towne, and did vnto them that were within, many dammaiges and displeasures. So they repoulsed them and did take the rampares and stronge places that they hadde made, and constraigned them to retyre to a straight place in the hieghest of the mountaigne. Beinge wherin, they rendredde themself vpon this condition. that they shuld render all the strangers that were comme to their ayde to the wyll of the said Athenyans and Corcyryans. And as touchinge those, that were of the towne, they shulde be surely kepte, vntill that the said Athenyans had determyned what they shuld wil to be done wyth them. So, that if one alonly amonge them were founde to haue done against the said treatie, than it was brokene, as concernynge all the reste. Ensuinge the which appoinctement, beinge ledde into the Islande of Ptichia,Ptychia and the chief and pryncypall of the towne, fearinge that the Athenyans woolde haue no pytie, and leste they woulde condempne them to death: did imagyn this trompery and deceyte. For they sente into the said Islande some of the frēdes of those, that were there. who dyd them to vnderstande, that the Athenyans had determyned to render them to the Corcyryans, that were in the cytie. wherfore they shulde do well and wysely to saue themselfe. promysinge to fournyshe shyps for to do it. wherunto they accorded. And so as they were entred into a shipp, thinkinge to saue thēself, they were takene by the Corcyrians. And for that, that in so doing they had brokene the appoinctement, they were by the dukes and capytayns of the Athenyans remytted to the wylle of the sayd Corcyrians, although that they were aduertysed of the tromperie and deceyte. But they did yt to the ende, that they shuld haue the better occasion to delyuer them. For somuche as willing to departe frō
                  thence into Sycille, they were angrie, that other people shulde haue the honnor to haue caryed to Athens, those prisoners, which they had conquered & vainquisshed. Beynge than the sayd prysoners rendred to them of the cytie, they were altogither put wtin a great edyfice. And afterwards they caused thē to be drawyn oute by twentys, all bounde: and passed through the men of armes whych were ranged on both sydes. And as they passed through the streate, bifore they aryued at the place, where the sayd men at armes were: those that had anny particuler hatred agaynste any of them, did prycke him, passinge by, with their glaiues. And specially the sargeantes did bounse and beate them, whan they wente to softlye. And fynally, whan they were aryued in the myddeste of the men at armes, they were hackedde in pieces. In this maner were slayn at thre tymes, to the nomber

For they sorowed greatly for it, for that, that it was there retraicre and their estaple for their shyppes, that came out of Lybia and oute of Egypte, and also empesched, that no robberies were done in the countrey of Laconie by sea on the coste, where it was in moste daunger. For that, that it laye opene and was subiecte to the sea of Sycille, and to that same of Crete. Being than the Atheniens aryued at the sayd Islande, with tenne shyppes and two thousande Millesians: they toke at the ariuall one citie of the sayd Islande whiche was on the sea syde, named Scandea,Scādia and the rest of the armie went through the Islāde agaynst the quarter, wherein was the citie of Malea. And first they came to the maistres towne, whiche is nigh the sea, named Cythere, where they founde the Cythereans, who attended for them, all in armure without the towne. So they assayled them, & after that they had defended themselfe a very small tyme, they cōstraigned them to retire into the vpper parte of the towne, and sone after, they yelded themselfe vnto Nycias, and to the other Capitaines Athenians, their lyues saued, & already before that they yelded themselfe, some among them had parlemented and spoken with Nicias for to aduise what thyng should be done, to the ende that thappoynctment should be made more suerly and the more readely. And in effect the Atheniās transported all the Cythereans into other places,

aswell for that they were Lacedemonyans, as also for that, that the same their Islande is dyrectely opposytt and foranempst the countrey of Laconia. Hauyng than the Athenyans takenne Scandea, whyche ys in ye poort of the sea, and

The Lacedemonyans, seynge that the Athenyans did kepe Cythere, and fearynge leste men shulde come to assaylle theyme, they were nott of opynyon to sende into annye parte a mayne armye, for to fyghte agaynste the ennemyes, but to departe theire people into dyuers places, so, as they thoughte to be necessarye for to defende them, and also into some of theym, for feare, that they shulde nott reuolte and rebelle. consyderynge the losse that they hadde made of theire people in the Islande nexte vnto Pylus, and also of the towne of Pylus, and of the cytie of Cythere, and the warre, whyche was mouedde agaynste theym, to be contrary to the

By reasone whereof, they huyredde and souldedde three houndred men at armes and certayne nombre of Archers, whyche thinge they were nott accustomedde to doo. And yet neuertheles, if euer, in any other tyme, they were slacke and slowe to make warre: yett were they at that tyme, more slouthefull (resaruedde the preparation for the armye by sea which they hadde) though that they hadde to doo agaynst the Athenyans, who reputedde nothing to be difficille, and harde for them to ouercomme, but that thynge whyche they woulde not enterpryse. And besydes that they were strykene wyth greate feare by many thynges, that my shappenedde vnto theym agaynste all reasone. wherby they were in feare to incurre one other suche losse, as they hadde made at Pylus. For thys reasonne, they durste not enterpryse any combate or fyghtynge, thynkyng that fortune was so contrary vnto them, that all their doynges shuld take euyll successe. And that same fantasie came vpon theyme for that, that they were not accustomedde to haue mysfortune. In thys manner they suffredde the Athenyans to waste and destroye their countreys by the sea syde, wythout ones remouynge themselfe, and also wythout sendynge thyder succours of other people, but only those, that they had sent thider for to defend them. Iudgyng thēself to be weaker than the sayde Athenyans, aswelle in nomber of people, as also by practique in the sea Notwythstandynge, one companye or bende of their people, whyche was in garnysone at Corcyre, and Aphrodisia,Aphrodisia. seing a compaygnie of the ennemyes lyghtely armedde in disordere, they chargedde vpon theym, and dyd slaye them all. But sone after they were rechasedde, by them that were armedde and loste some of their people, togyders wyth theire armure. The Athenyans, after that they had set vp their Trophee in Cytheree, they wente into Epidaure, and fromthence, hauynge wastedde a great parte of the lande of the Epidauriens, they wente into Thyree,Thirea. whyche is in the countrey, that men calle Cymurya.Cymeria. whych departeth the countrey of Laconie and that same of Argos, and was by the Lacedemonyans geuene to laboure vnto the Egenetes, whyche were chasedde frome theire countrey, aswell for the saruyces that they hadde done vnto them in tyme of the Eartquacke, as also for this, that albeit, that they were subiectes of the Athenyans, yet hadde they alwayes takene their parte. Those Egenetes than vnderstandynge that the Athenyans were commynge towardes thē and arryued at their porte, they habandōned and dyd forsake the walle, whyche they had made by ye sea syde, and retired vp to the heyght of their towne which is distant frō the sea about tenne stades. And with them retired one bend of Lacedemonie, which was sente to defende them, and also to helpe to make ye wal. But

whan it came to the poyncte to entre into the towne, they wolde not enter therein. whatsoeuer instance, that the Egenetes made vnto theym. For yt they thought it daungerous to enclose themselfe. But seinge that they were not hable to resiste their ennemys, they retyredde into the hygheste places in the mounteigne. Sone after, the Athenyans came wyth all their strengthe bifore the towne of Thyree, so dydde take it peasably and burnedde yt. And all the Egynetes, that they founde lyuynge, they chargedde in their shippes, for to carye them to Athēs, togyder wyth Tantalus,Tantalus. sonne of Patrocles, whom the Lacedemonyans hadde sente vnto them, for to gouerne, howbeit he was soore hurte. And lykewyse they caryed thyder, some of the prysoners, that they hadde takene at Cytheree. which Cithereans were afterwardes by the Athenyans sente into dyuers Islandes. And vpon those that remaynedde in the towne of Cytheree, was imposedde and sett a trybute, yerely of foure talentes.

               ¶ Howe the Sycilians at the perswation of Hermocrates, made peace among themself and sente agayne frothence the Athenyans. ☞The .viii. Chapter.
               IN that same sommer, in the countreye of Sycile, treuese were made. furste betwene the Camerins and the Gelians. And sone after, out of all the cyties of the countrey, Ambassadours were sente to Gele, for to treate of thappoynctement betwene them. And after that manye opynyons hadde bene spokenne, dyuers and contrary the one to the othere, whyche euerye one dydde speake for hys particuler intereste: makynge their doleaunces of the wronges, whyche they pretendedde to haue bene done in the cytie of Gele, Hermocrates,Hermocrates. sonne of Harmō Syracusaine, whyche was the same parsone, that mooste sturredde and prouokedde them to the appoynctemente, dydde speake vnto them, in thys manner.
               
                  The Oration of Hermocrates.
                  I Am of a cytie (lordes Sycilians) whyche is not of the leaste of the countrey: and also ys not muche trauailled wythe warre. wherefore that, whych I shall say, ys not for that, that I do owe to haue more feare of the warre, than the othere. But onely ys to shewe you what semethe vnto me to be the common welth of all the countrey. And albeit that, to recyte vnto youe here, what displeasure and what tourmente, the warre ys: and all the thynges that thereby arne wonte to happene, there ys no man that canne welle expresse though that he vsed a very longe talke: yet somuch there is, that as no man, for lacke of vnderstandynge and knowlayge, ys constraynedde to enter hedlyng into it: so also is there none that wolle refrayne to make it, if he thynketh thereby to gett: for feare of any yll that maye come therof. But it chanceth ryghte oftene, that those, whyche enterpryse yt, do hope thereby more wynnynges, than they wolle regarde the difficultie and daungers thereof. And those, that do consyder moste the inconuenyences, loue better to be in hazarte of that, whyche maye happene, than presently, to susteygne, any payne or dāmage.

And yet nothere the one, nor the othere canne obteigne the same, whyche they hope: but throughe the benefytte and ayde of the tyme. wherelore I thynke that to speake of the appoynctemente, ys a thynge conuenyente for all menne, and specyallye for vs in thys saysonne, if we be well aduysedde. For if heretofore we euerye one haue enterpretysedde, the warre, thynkynge therby to make his proffytte, and to prouyde for hys affayre: we oughte nowe, whyche be all in warre and stryues: to assaye, to comme agayne to the peace, wherein we were. And if we cannot by that meane recouer euerye one that, whyche apperteigneth vnto him: we maye afterwardes retourne to the warre, if we thynke good. But we muste vnderstande if we bee discreate and prudente, that thys assemblie ys not made pryncypally for to knowe of oure particular questyons: but rather to deuyse (if we maye) to saue and wythdrawe all the countrey of Sycille out of the handes of the Athenyans, who in my fantasie deceyue vs all, and goo aboute to subdue vs. And consyder and thynke, that they oughte to be arbitrours and necessarie sequesters and procurers of oure peace, more than my woordes and talke. For that, that they haue an armye all preste more puissante, than all the othere Grekes, whyche they maye transporte ryghte easely hyther by sea wyth a small nō
                     ber of shippes, whan they shalle knowe youre faultes. whyche they doo hope of and dailly doo laye wayte for. And thoughe that they do comme hyder as of a good fellaushipp and allyance, yet for a trouthe, they do intreate vs ennemylike: and go aboute nothynge, but their particuler proffytt. And if we doo chose and accepte the warre, and call to oure ayde thies people here (whyche do come with oute beynge called) for to conducte yt: whan they shall see that we shalbe welle trauailled and haue empoueryshedde, the one the othere, they wyll repute yt to be the proffitte of theire estate and seignyorye. And than, whan they shall see vs broughte lowe and decayedde, they shall comme wyth a greater puyssance
                        •
                      and shall brynge vs all into their obeissance. wherefore if we be sage, yt is muche better for euerye one of vs to call his frendes and confederates, for to inuade the landes of an other, than to destroye our oune, whyche we nowe possesse, and so, take the daungers and parelles vpon vs. And we oughte to consyder, that the particuler sedycyons of the cyties of Sycille, be not onelye daungerous to the same, but also vnto all the countreye, and to all vs that be therein. For so longe, as they do fighte the one agaynste the othere, there bee that laye wayte to do vs all displeasure. Hauynge than regarde to thies respectes and consyderatyons
                        •
                      we shulde reconcile oureselues euery one particulerly wyth hys ennemye, and the one cytie wyth the othere, and all togidre take payne, to saue and delyuer all our countrey of Sycille. And we shulde not haue fantasye, that some of vs be descendedde and come of the Doryens, whyche be ennemys of Athenyans, and that the Chalcides, for the auncyent parentage, whych they haue wyth the Ionyans, be theire good frendes. For the Athenyans haue not enterpretysedde thys warre, for annye parttakynge of oure factes: but for couetyce of the goodes, whyche we all haue in Sycille. Lyke as we maye welle knowe by theyme amongeste vs, whyche be Chalcydiens. who callynge theym to theire ayde, althoughe they neuer hadde saruyce of theym, nor amytie wythe theym, yett be they comme readelye vnto theire succoures, and haue made allyance wyth theym more wyllyngly, than wyth the other. And yet neuerthelas the sayd Athenyans be to be pardonned, and arne not to be blamed, if they go aboute to encrease their estate and seignyorie. But they be to blame, whych arne tomuche prone and ready to obey and submytt themself vnto them. For it is a naturall thynge for euerye man, to wylle to be ouere and gouerne those, that wolle submitt themself vnto him, & to

defende themself from them, that wyll inuade and oppresse them. And there is not he amongeste vs, that vnderstandethe not thies thynges. And whosoeuer shall not knowe that a common feare, oughte to be eschewedde by a general and common prouysion, he deceyueth hymselfe greately. And if we agree oureselues all togider, we shall veray easely brynge oureselues out of thys feare. For the Athenyans do not assaylle vs oute of their lande, but out of oure owne, to wytte, by those, that haue calledde them. And by thys meane we shall not appease one warre, by an othere warre: but by a generall peace, we shalle appease all oure discordes, wythoute anny difficultie. And they, that haue bene called by vs, beynge honestly comme for an euyl intente: shal retourne reasonablie frustrated of their purpose. And thys whyche I saye vnto youe, as touchynge the Athenyans, (all those, that haue wylle to counsaille well) wyll fynde it good. But as concerning the peace, whyche all honneste people esteme the beste thynge in the worlde: wherfore shulde not we desyre it? Thynke ye not, that if anny of vs hath any goodes, yea or anny thynge contrarye vnto hym: that reste and peace be not better for hym than the warre? and that it be not better for vs, aswell of the one parte, as of the other, to departe from armure and strife, so to vse of oure goodes in reste, and to enioye peace wythoute daungere of oure honnours, of our dignyties and of all the othere goodes, that canne be nombred and receyuedde by a very long talke, farre better, than, as it may be done, wyth the incōmodyties of the warre? All whyche thynges consyderedde, ye oughte not, lordes, to disprayse my sayinges. But by the same, euery one oughte to prouyde for hys oune welthe. And if there be any man, that hopeth to gett any thynge by the warre, by ryght or by wronge: he ought well to feare to be therof deceyued. knowynge, that to manye, whyche thought to reuenge their iniuries and wronges: or vnder confydence of puyssance, hoped to encrease their faculties and power: the whole contrary hathe chaunced. whyche ys, that some loste their healthe, and some their goodes. For it is not sayde, that vengeaunce shulde always take effecte, althoughe it were enterprysed for a iuste cause. Force also wyth a good hope and esperance, ys not a thynge establyshedde, alwaye to contynue. But of
                        •
                     entymes temerytie & rashnes taketh better effecte, than profounde wytte. And thoughe thys temerytie, be the thynge, whereby the people haue mooste oftene bene deceyued, yet whan yt happenethe well, it is iudgedde to be ryght good. For thys, that whan there is asmuche feare in theym that assaille, as in those that be assayledde, aythere partie procedeth therin, more warrely and circumspectly. And so shulde we do, lordes: aswelle for feare of thynges to comme, as also of the Athenyans, who be alreadye fearefulle vnto vs, and prouyde in oure affayres for the tyme to come. And euerye one of vs, presupposynge that the thynge whyche he purposedde to doo, maye be empeschedde by those twoo meanes, to sende oute of oure lande the ennemye, whyche ys already vponne oure shulders. And to brynge that to passe, we oughte bifore all thynges to conclude amongeste vs, a perpetuall allyaunce, or at the leaste a longe treuese, in deferrynge oure particuler discordes and differencies. And holde yt for moste certayne, that if ye wylle geue fayth and bileue my woordes: by thys meane euery of vs shalle haue hys cytie in lybertie. By occasyon whereof, it shalbe in our facultie and power to render to those, that shalle do vs good or euyll, accordynge to their desaruynge. And by the contrary, if youe bileue me not: but rather wylbe in the obeissance of straungers, there shal be no questyon to make oure reuenge. But those that shall obteigne the victorie at their wylle, shalbe by necessitie frendes of them, that be greatly their ennemys. And aduersaries to those, vnto whome it is not conuenyent, that youe be. And

I, who (as I haue shewedde youe at the begynnynge) am of a cytie, whyche ys the greatest and mooste puissante of the countrey, and make the warre more by assaylynge, than in defendynge: am he, whyche counsaylleth, that wee agree and accorde altogiders, hauynge regarde to the daungers, that be for to comme. And that nother we goo aboute to do hurte somuche euery one af vs to hys aduersarye
                        •
                      as thereby we procure vnto oureselfe a greater: nother that we shulde be so furyous through oure domesticall contentyons, that we shulde perswade ourselues to be maysters of oure oune counsaille and of fortune (whom we rule not, but as raysonne shall requyre, ayther that we vainquishe, orelles that we be vainquishedde) that we rather do it amongeste oureselfe, than to suffre it of ennemyes. For yt ys no shame for one Doryen to be vainquishedde by an othere Doryen, nor for one Chalcydian by an other Chalcydian, being all neyghbours, the one of the other, and inhabytinge one selfe lande, and one selfe Islande. And we be all named by one name Syciliens, and so we shalle make warre amonge ourselfe, whan yt shalbe requisitte, And after, whan we shal haue parlamented togyder
                        •
                      we shall fall to agremente. And yf we be wyse, we shalbe neuerthelas of one opynyon to chase the straungers oute of oure countrey. For truly, whan we shalbe forcedde and oppressedde partycularlye: we be all in daunger vnyuersally. And we oughte not at anye tyme hereafter to calle oure allyes estraungers, for to ayde vs, nor for to make appoynctemente and agree vs. In whyche doing, we shall fournyshe Sycille wyth two greate benefyttes: the one for the tyme presente: and the othere for the tyme to comme. For we shalle delyuer yt frome the Athenyans, and oute of the intestyne and inwarde warre, wherin it is at this presente: and for the tyme to comme, we shall possesse it franke and free, muche lesse subiecte to all espialles and to all pryuie waytinges than it nowe ys. Thus dydde Hermocrates speake. At whose perswation the Syciliens made appoinctement togyders. In suche manner, that they forsoke the warre on all sides, and that euery man dydde kepe that whyche he possedde: resaruedde, that the cytie of Morgance was rendred by the Syracusains vnto the Camerins,Morgā
                        tena. payinge a certayne somme of monney. And that done, those, whyche hadde called the Athenyans, declaredde to the Capytaynes and pryncypalleste of them, that they hadde comprysed them wythin the appoynctemente. And by that meane, they contended them, and retournedde fromthence wyth their shyppes vnto Athens. where wyth the Athenyans were so dyspleasedde: that they comdempnedde the Capytayns, to wyt, Pthiodorus and Sophocles, into bannyshmente: and Eurymedon, in monney, hauynge opynyon that it was their faulte, that they hadde nott subduedde the Islande of Sycille, and that they hadde bene induced and huyred by giftes to retourne fromthence. For the Athenyans did than assure themself, somuche in the prosperytie, that they hadde hadde: that nothynge semedde impossible vnto them. For they thoughte that they myght atteigne, aswell difficill and harde enterpryses, as the light and easie, and wyth a small armye, aswelle, as wyth a greate. And of thys theire presumptyon, the felicitie was cause, whyche hadde chauncedde vnto them in many thinges, beyonde all reasone. And that had brought them, into thys vayne glorye.
               
            
            
               
               Howe the Athenyans failled to take the cytie of Megare by intelligence and confederation of some of the citezeins, and howe it was succoured by the Lacedemonyans. ☞The .ix. Chapter.
               THat same somer, those of Megare, ennoyed aswell wyth the warre of the Athenyans, whyche came vpon them euerye yeare for to spoyle & make waste in their land: as also by the robberyes and pillages that were comytted and done by some of thei
                     •
                   cytezeins, whiche were bannished for the sedytion of the people, and kepte themself at Pegne:Pegne. they entredde into communication and purposed amongest themself to reteigne and receue agayne the said bannished men, for to auoyde and exchue, that the cytie shuld not be lost through their differences and varyances. And the frendes of the exiles & bannyssed men, parceyuinge that the matter began to waxe colde, they made a newe requeste, that the sayd exiles might be spoken wyth. Than the chiefeste of the towne, consyderynge that the people coulde not longe endure the euils that happened vnto them
                     •
                   by meanes of the sayde dissensions: they came to parlemēt with the dukes of the Athenyans, to wytt, Hippocrates,Hippocrates. sonne of Ariphron, and Demosthenes sonne of Alcisthenes,Demosthenes. for to rēder the towne vnto them: thinking that there shulde be lesse danger vnto them in so doinge, than if they shulde sett agayne and receyue the exiles into it. And so they accorded wyth them, that they shulde furste take the longe wals, whiche extended from the cytie vnto Nysee,Nysea. where their porte was. which walls conteigned about eyght houndred stades of lenghte: for to empesche, that the Peloponesians shulde geue no succours to thē of the towne, from the place, where they had theire garnisonne, for saulfgarde of the cytie. And that afterwardes, they shulde gett the Castell, whiche was on the highest place of the towne vpon a rocke. whyche thinge they thought to be easie ynough to do. And whan they had ordeyned all their treatie, they made preparation, euerye one for his parte, for to execute it. And the Athenyans came that nyght to the Islande, whyche ys nexte of the cytie, named Mynonue wyth sixe houndred men well armed,Minoa. vnder the conducte of Hippocrates. And fromthence they came in the tyme of nyght vnto a dyche, nighe vnto the whych, was a brick keele, wherin the bricke was brūte, for to build & repayre the wals of the towne. On the other syde, Demosthenes was in embushemente, nighe to the temple of Mars, whyche was a lytle further of, wyth the Plateens lightly armed, & some other aduenturers, wythout, that any parsone had knowlayge therof, but those, that were of the treatie. And bifore that it was daye, the sayde Plateens came fourth for to execute their interpryse at the openynge of the gates, whyche thing they had vsed there a longe tyme byfore, in thys maner. The cytezeins were accustomed (as people, whyche lyued by pillages and by robberies) to drawe in the night tyme (by consente of the officer of the sayde longe walle) a brigantyne in a charett, the whyche they dyd caste afterwardes into the dyche and fromethence conueyde it into the sea. And whā it came to the breake of the day, after that they had in the nyght tyme vpon the sea, done what they myght: they retourned with the brygantyne fromthence, and bestowedde it agayne bifore it was daye, in the charrett wythin the sayd walles, through the poorte itself, to thende, that the Athenyans, who had their garde and garnisons in the Isle of Minoue, shulde not parceue theire theftes and robberies, not seinge any shippe within theire poorte.

The sayde brygantyne, than beynge brought agayne, and the gate opened for to bestowe it wythin: as it was in the bestowyng of it, the Athenyans issued fourth of theire embushemente for to saise and take the gate, bifore that yt mighte be shutt agayne, by cause of the stowage of the sayd brygantyne, lyke as it was appoyncted wyth them of the towne, that were of the intellygence and confederation. who were there ready & dyd slay those, that were at the kepinge of the sayd gate. And the Plateens and aduenturers which were wyth Demosthenes, were the furst that came to sease and possesse the poorte and entred into it by the quartier, where as presently is sene a trophee or victorie addressed & set vp. And they repoulsed the garnysone of Peloponesians. whych hauynge hearde ye bruyt, was come vnto the succours. And thys endurynge the Athenyans wel armed, arriued. who were lett in by those Plateans, and as they entred, they mounted vpon the walles. Agaynste whome the Peloponesyans resistedde wyth their power. But they were muche lesse people, and therby many of them were there slayne. And ye other retyred feringe to be circūuented: chiefly for that, that it was not yet daye. And also perceyuynge that some of those of the cytie dyd fighte agaynste theym, To wytt, those, that were consentynge to the trahisone: they thoughte that all were of lyke mynde. But yet they thought it the rather, for that, that the trompet of the Athenyans made of hys proper authorytie a crye, that all the Megaryans that wolde come to render themselfe to the Athenyans and render theire armure, shulde be sauedde and not haue annye hurte. For whan the sayde Peloponesyans vnderstode that crye, they retourned all to Nysee, in flyght. Anone after, aboute dawninge of the daye, the sayd wall beinge takene, whyche extended vnto the porte, the tumulte was greate in the towne, for those, that were partakers of the trahisone, sayde that men shulde opene the gates and issue fourthe agaynste the Athenyans. wherunto the people agreed. But they sayde it
                     •
                   to the intent that the sayd Athenyans shulde enter after that they were openedde. For so they conuenaunted wyth them, and to the ende that they myght be knowyn amonge the other, and that at the entrye, no man shuld do them euyl and harme: they had geuene for a tokene, that they shuld be oyncted with oyle, for a differēce from the other. And they thoughte that it shuld be greater suertie for them, that the gates shulde be opened, for that, that there were foore thousande foote men well armed and sixe houndred horsmen Athenyans, whyche were comme that same night from Eleusyne, ready for to enter into the towne. Beinge than those that were oyled come to the gates for to cause them to be opened: one amonge them discouered the trahisone vnto the othere, that knewe nothing therof. wherby the tumulte and the fraye was greatte among the people. And in effecte they assembledde for all sydes there, and were of opynyon that the gates shulde not be opened. sayinge that they durste not do it at othere tymes whan the Athenyans were come bifore their towne, all though that they were more puissant, than they than were, and that the towne shulde not be putt into so euydent a daūger. And if any wolde do the contrary, that men shulde begynne to fyghte agaynste them. And thys sayd they, wythoute makynge any semblante that they hadde parceyued the trahysone, but by manner of aduyse and of good counsaylle, for to exchue the daungers. And finally those of the people were strongest at the gates, so that they wolde not suffre them to be openedde. In suche sorte, that the conspyratours coulde not execute their trahisone. Than the Athenyans, parceynyng that the gates were not opened vnto them: thought that there was some empeschemente. wherfore, consyderynge that they were to fewe people for to assiege the cytie, they wente all agaynste Nysee, and enclosed it wyth walles. For

they thought, that if they coulde take it bifore any succours came thider, they myght afterwardes veray easely take the cytie by composition. And so caused with all diligence workemenne to come frome Athens, togiders with Ironne and other necessarye matter, with suche expedition that within a veray small tyme they acheued the walle. Whiche they beganne at the ende of that same, whiche they hadde takene frome the syde of Megare. And frome thence, they wrought it on bothe sydes of Nysee, into the sea, and fourthwith dyd close it with dyches. For whan the one was busyed at the walle, thoder were occupyed at the dyches. And dyd take the stone, the bricke, and the woode in the suburbes. Also they dyd cutte downe the trees, that were there aboute. And where there lacked matter, they ramparde in, earthe with pynnes of woode. And also the houses, that were without the towne, theyr toppes being bette downe, did sarue them for towers and bullworkes. All whiche woorke, they parfaicted and ended within that selfe daye and the daye folowyng at the nyght. Whiche parceyued by them that were within Nisee, and also that they had no vittailles, for they made no prouision, but as it was brought them out of the towne daye by daye: consideryng also that there was no hope to bee succoured by the Peloponesians so readely: and moreouer thynkyng that all the Magariens were agaynst them, they made composicion with the Athenians, to wytte, that they shulde render their armure, and euerye man departe with a small some of monney. And that the Lacedemonians and other estraungers that
                     •
                   were there within, should be at the wyll of the Athenians. In suche manner, those of the towne departed fromthence. And the Athenians, hauyng wonne Nisee, and broken the longe walle, that came frome the cytie vnto Nisee, they prepared themself for to assiege and assaille the cytie of Megare. Nowe it chaunced that in that same seasone, Brasidas, sonne of Tellides Lacedemonien, was in the quartier of Corinthe and of Sicione for to assemble people of the countrey of Thrace. who vnderstandyng the takyng of the walles of Megare, and doubting that the Peloponesians, that were at Nisee, were in danger: he sent vnto the Beotians with all diligence and commanded, that they shulde come towardes hym incōtinently, with the greatest bende that they coulde vnto Tripodisque. Whiche is a burgage in the territory of Megare, vnder the mountaigne of Gerania. From whiche place, he himselfe came with two thousande seuen houndred Corinthians well armed, foore houndred Philasiens, and seuen houndred Sycioniens, besyde the other, that he hadde already assembled, not knowing yet of the taking of Nisee, the whiche he vnderstode there. And forthwith, bifore that the ennemyes were aduertised of hys cōmyng, for that, that he was ariued by nyght, he wente with foore houndred of the best of hys compaignie, straight to the citie of Megare, faignyng, that he would take Nysee by stealth. But for trougth, hys pryncipall intente was to entre into the citie, if he hadde coulde, and to haue furnyshed it. And whan he was come vnto the gates, he demaunded of the Megarians that they should lette hym in, geuyng them good hope to take incontinently Nysee. But bothe the bendes, fearyng hys commynge, to wytte, the one for doubte, leste he shulde brynge agayne the bannyshed into the towne, and chase them from thence: and the frendes of the bannyshed, leste the other for feare thereof, shoulde fyght agaynste theym, and that throughe occasion of their difference, the Athenyans that were nyghe, there vnto them, shoulde take the Cytie: they were of opinion not to receyue the sayed Brasidas, but rather to see, who shoulde haue the victorye, of the Athenians or of the Peloponesians. For the partakers, of aither of the parties, dyd attende to declare

themself to fauoure that parte, that shall haue hadde the better. Brasidas than seyng, that by no meane he coulde enter: returned towardes the other people of his army. And the same day bifore that it was clere, the Beotians arryued, who, bifore that they hadde receyued the letters from Brasidas, vnderstandyng the commynge of the Athenians, were come fourth with all their strength, for to succoure the Megarians. For that, that they estemed the danger to bee common vnto them. But whan they were in the lande of Platee, hauyng there receyued the letters from Brasidas: they were muche more assured. And so dyd sende twelue houndred foote menne and sixe houndred horsemenne, vnto Brasidas, and the other retourned euey man vnto his house. After that they were all ioigned togider with Brasidas, they were aboute sixe thousande. On the other syde, the Athenians kepte themselfe in battaille aboutes Nisee, resarued the fotemen lightly armed, who being disparsed & skattered abrode in the fieldes, were assailled and repoulsed by the horsemen Beotians euen vnto the sea, bifore that the Athenians did knowe the coming of the said Beotians. For they came neuer bifore, to the succours of Megare. Wherefore they doubted them not. But anon as they sawe them, they issued agaynst them, and there was a veray longe fight among the horsemen, so that it coulde not be well iudged who hadde the better thereof. And although that on the Beotians parte, the Capitaine & some other were slaine, whiche aduentured themfelf, euen vnto the walles of Nisee, by occasion whereof, the Athenians hauing rendred the carkasses by appoin
                     ••
                  mente, did sette vp a Trophee in signe of victorie: yet the battaille was not pursued by the one parte nor the other. So and in suche wyse, that one coulde not attrybute the victory more to the one, than to the other. And so the Beotians retyred to their compaignie, and the Athenians to Nysee. After that, Brasidas hauyng chosen a comodious place by the sea syde and nigh inough to Megare, lodged there his campe, and remoued not, attending that the Athenians shoulde come to assaille thē. For he thought that they of the citie would regarde and marke who should haue the better, and that beyng there ready to fight without assailling the ennemyes or putting any thing in hazarte, he should haue the victorye. And as touchyng the citie he thought to haue done ynough. Forsomuche as if he hadde not come, the Citezens durst not haue assayed the fortune of the battaille agaynste the Athenians, and by ye meane shuld haue lost the citie. But seyng the succours to become, & that those Athenians durst not fight, it semed vnto hym, that they would accept him and his bende into the citie, and by that meane without effusion of bloud, & without daunger, he shuld haue that, that he was come for. Lyke as it happened afterwardes. For the Athenians did rancke themself in battaille nyghe to the longe walles, hauing the selfe opinion that the Athenians had: to witte, not to fyght, except he came to assaulte them, for that, that they thought, that there was greater apparance and raisonne for them not to begyn the battaill, than for the other, considered, that they had had already manye victories. Wherefore, if at that houre being in lesser nomber they had hazarded it and the other had had the victory, he would so haue followed it, that the citie shuld haue been lost thorugh thē, or that they shuld lose one great parte of their army. And also they persuaded thēself that the other shuld rather begyn. For that, that they were of dyuers cities, whereby they presumed that they shuld not haue pacience to refrayne, as they that were all Athenians. In this manner, hauing longe attended on the one syde and on the other, they retyred and did withdrawe themself to wytte, the Athenians to Nisee, and the Peloponesians to the place, from whence they were departed. Than the Magarians those that were frendes of the exiles,

parceyuyng that the Athenians durst not assaille thoder, they dyd take courage, and with the pryncipallest of the towne, openned the gates vnto Brasidas: and receyued hym into the towne, as hauyng the victorye. And came to parlamente with hym, whereby those of the other bende, were in greate feare. And anone after, the people that were come at commandement of Brasidas retourded euery man into his quarter. And he wente fromthence vnto Corinthe, fromwhence he departed for to assemble his army in Thrace. The Atheniās also retourned frōethence into their countrey. By occasion whereof, those, that had been of the coniuracion and conspiracie and of the treatie, for to cause them to come: parceiuing that they were discouered, withdrewe themself secretly out of the citie. And the other, hauing spoken with the parentes of the exiles, called agayne those, that were at Pegne, with greate othes neuer more to remember the innuries passed. But rather to geue themself with one accorde to the common weale of the citie. But within a certaine tyme after: they being chosene to offices and gouernance of the towne: whan the musters of the people were made, knowyng the armure of them that had bene the chief of thintelligence with the Atheniās, they apprehended of thē to the nomber of a houndred, whom they caused to dye by iudgement of the sayed people. Whome they induced to condempe them. And by this meane, the gouernance of the citie was reduced & brought, to the will of a small nomber of Citizens, hauing the fauour of the people, whiche state, though it begonne, by sedicion and mutynerye, yet afterwardes it endured a longe

               Of a losse that the Athenians had of their shippes. And how Brasidas passed through the countrey of Thrace by the helpe of Perdicas kyng of Macedonie and of certen his frendes of the sayd countrey, for to come to the ayde of the Chalcidians. ☞The .x. Chapter.
               THat self same somer the Mytylenians, hauing purposed for to fortefye and repayer the citie of Antandre:Antandrus. the two capitayns of the three, whiche the Athenians had sent to receue and gather money through the landes of their party: Demedocus and Aristides,
                     Demedocus.
                     Aristides.
                   who were than in Hellesponte in thabsence of Lamachus (which was the thirde,Lamachus. and was gone into the sea of Pontus with tenne shippes) had consultacion bitwene them of that matter. And it semed vnto them, a daungerous matter, to suffer. Fearyng leste it shuld happene, as it had bifore tyme in ye citie of Sanmie whether, the exiles, that had bene dryuen fromthence: had retyred and ioyned themselfes altogiders. And with the ayde of the Peloponesians, who had sent them maroners, they dyd grete hurt to them of the cytie, & grete saruices to the sayd Peloponesians. For this cause, they wente with their shippes and men of warre agaynst the sayd cytie of Antandre. And hauing repoulsed and ouercome, those, whiche were come agayne and retourned thider, who yssued fourth against them in battaille, they dyd take it. Sonne after Lamachus, whiche was goane into the countrey of Pontus, beeing there arryued with his shyppes, within the floude of Calece,Calex. whiche passeth through out the lande of Heraclien, by a soubdayne breache and inundacion of the sayd ryuer, that commethe out of the mountaignes: he loste all hys shippes, and came fromethence with his people by lande, trauersyng the countreis of Bythinie and of Thrace, whiche is beyonde the sea of the coste of Asia:

vnto the citie of Chalcidonie:Chalcedan. whiche is at the mouthe of the sea of Pontus, apperteignyng to the Megarians, In that same somer, Demosthenes, Duke of the Athenians, departyng from Megare, came with fortye shippes into Naupacte for to execute the enterprise, whiche he & Hippocrates had made togiders with certein Beotiens. Which was to reduce the estate of that same countrey, to the gouernance of the comon people: like as that same of Athens was. Of which cōspiracie was principall author & conductor, a citizene of Thebes, that had bene bannyshed, named Priodorus. And they had determined to execute it in this mā
                  ner. That is, that those Beotians shulde by treasone surrendre to the Athenians one towne, named Syphas.Siphoe Whiche is in the territorie of the citie of Thespie in the goulphe of the sea Crissee.Thespes. And on the other syde some other shulde haue delyuered them one other towne, named Chironee,Cheronea. whiche were subiect to the Orchomenians,Orchomenia. by the ayde of the bannyshed men of the sayd citie of Orchomenie. Who had soulded & waged certaine men of warre, being Peloponesians. Nowe is the sayd towne of Cheronee, in thextrēmyties & fourthest parte of the coūtrey of Beoce. Directly anempst Phanotide,Phanotides. in the countrey of Phociens, partely inhabited with the sayd Phocians. On the other syde, that the Athenians shuld occupie & take the temple of Apollo in the towne of Delos in the countrey of Tanagrians,Delos, of the coste of Eubee. All the whiche enterprises shulde be executed on one daye therfore named. To thintent that the Beotians, vnderstandyng the takyng of the other townes and fearyng to bee in their oune houses, shulde not be so bolde to come to succour Delos. And the sayd Athenians thought, that if their enterprise myght come to effect, so that they myght enclose the temple of Delos with a walle, they might easely trouble the estate & the gouernance of the Beotians. If not soubdainly, yet at ye least, with the tyme (kepyng garnisones within the sayd townes) that they would ouerronne and pillage the countrey. And furder hauing withdrawen thider all the bannyshed men and other nigh adioyignyng, the Athenians myght at tymes sende thider succoure to them, that were withdrawen thider. And the Beotiens, not hauing a sufficiente armye for to resist, myght geue them lawe and manner to lyue at their wylle and pleasure. And thenterprise shulde be executed in suche sorte. For Hippocrates, that ledde and conducted the footemen shulde, at a day named, departe from Athens and enter into the lande of the Beotians. And on the other syde, Demosthenes was gone to Naupacte with foortye shippes for to assemble people of the countrey of Acarnan
                     •
                  e, and of other, adioignyng to them, & shulde be the selfe daye at Syphas for to entre into it, by the meane of the prattique. Hauing than Demosthenes assembled a great nomber of people, aswell of Eniades, as of other Acarnanians, and also of other allyes Athenians, that were come to be there from all costes: he went first lo lande at Salynthe and at Agree,
                     Salynthum.
                     Agree.
                   where they looked and attended also for other people and prepared themself for to come to his enterprise at Syphas at the daye ordeigned. Nowe happened it, that in that selfe ryme: Brasidas that was gone with a thousande,Brasidas. & fyue houndred footemen for to geue order to the affaires of the countrey of Thrace being come, into the citie of Heraclee in the coūtrey of Trachine:
                     Heraclea.
                     Trachine.
                  he damaūded of the frendes, which he had in the coū
                  trey of Thessale that they shulde come to accōpaignie hym, that he myght passe suerly. So there came to hym, Panerus of Dorie,Panerus. Hippolochidas of Thorile.Hippolachidas. Strophacus of Chalcide, and certaine other Thessalyans, whiche were in the towne of Melyte in the countrey of Achaye,Meltia. and conducted hym. And lykewyse Niconidas of Larisse,Nicomas. parent of Perdicas,Perdiccas. kyng of Macedonie, came to him for that selfe cause. For otherwyse it had not bene possible for the sayd Brasidas to

passe through ye same countrey of Thessale, muche lesse, than at any other tyme (though alwayes bifore yt there was danger in it) & somuche y• more doubt was therin, yt he was in armure. For therby he had brought into suspicion y• people of the countrey, that toke parte wt the Atheniās. Whereby, if Brasidas had not had the conduct of the geeatest of the coūtrey, which had accustomed to gouerne the people, more by force, thā by auctoritie & iustice: he coulde neuer haue passed. And yet neuertheles he had muche busines wt them. For those that toke parte wt the Athenyans, mett with hym at the riuer of Empee,Empeus. for to empesche & stoppe hys passage, saying yt it was oulrage & iniury, for him to passe wtout hauing saulfconducte of the people of the countrey. Whereunto those of the countrey that cōducted him, answered thē: yt the said Bra
                     •
                  idas & the people would not passe by force. But that being there aryued soubdainly, as their frēdes: they ought to suffre thē to passe. And Brasidas himself sayd, that he was their frende
                     •
                   and passed through their countrey not for to offende thē, but only for to go agaynst the Atheniās, ennemyes of ye Lacedemonians, & knewe not yt there was any enmytie betwene the Thessalyans & the Lacedemoens, whereby the one myght not passe through the countrey of the other. And that he would not (as in dede he coulde not) passe thorough theirs, against their willes. But he prayed them hartely yt they would not empesche nor hinder hym. And by those woordes they retourned, & he passed at his pleasure. Notwithstanding those that did conducte hym, counsailled, that he shulde passe wt the most diligence that he coulde, through the rest of the coūtrey: without aresting in any parte. To thintent that he gaue no time & leasure to the other paysantes to assemble togider, which thing he did. In suche sorte, that the self day that he was departed from Mylett,Pharsalus. he came vnto Pharsale & lodged his campe nigh to the Ryuer of Apidane.Apidanus. And fromthence he came into Phacie,Phaciū. fro Pharsa, into Perebie.Peroebia. In which place, those that had conducted him thider, lefte him. And was conducted by the Perebiens (who be of the seigniorie and empire of the Thessalians) vnto Dyon,Dion. which is a towne vnder the mount Olimpus in the countrey of Macedonie on ye coste of Thrace, in thobeissance of Perdiccas. In this manner Brasidas trauersed the countrey of Thrace, bifore that any tyme was had for to empesche or lett his passage. And he went vnto Perdiccas, who was in Chalcide, whiche Perdiccas & the other Thraciens that were reuolted & turned against the Athenians, vnderstāding their prosperitie, & fearing to be by them assailled, had required succours of the Peloponesians, principally those of Chalcide, forsomuche as they feared that the Athenians would come first vpon them. And also for that they did vnderstande yt the other cities, their neighbours, that were not rebelled, did coniure & conspire already againste them for to ouercome them. And as touchinge Perdiccas, albeit that he was not their ennemye declared, yet he feared the ennemyties, that he had had with them in tymes passed, & for that cause demanded ayde, of the Lacedemonians against thē. And also against the king of Lyncesters, whome he had determyned wholy to subdue. An other occasion there was for the which that armye came out of the countrey of Peloponese. Whiche was, that the Lacedemonians, parceiuing the euyl chances that were happened to them, and that the Athenians had done many enterprises in their countrey: they thought that there was nothyng more expediente to diuerte and tourne them, than to make some alarme to their allyes. And somuche the more, that there were people that furnished to the charges of ye army, and of other, that attended but their coming, for to rebelle against the Atheniās. And also it moued thē muche, the losse, that they had at Pylus. For they feared lest the Esklaues would make somme mutyne or sedicion. Wherefore they were

welle eased to sende them fourth vnder this coloure. For through the feare, that those Lacedemonians had, to wytt, those that had conducted and had charge of the affaries, aswell of the yonge, as of the comon people, and aboue all, of the esklaues, on whome they layde most watche: they had in times past
                     •
                   caused a cry to be made, that those that had done most vailliantly shulde stande aparte, geuing them hope to enfranchise and sett them at lybertie. But it was to vnderstande their courage. Whereby being chosen out of al them to the nomber of two thousande, and those brought with procession crowned with flowers vnto the temples, so as the custome was of thē, to whome lybertie was geuen: sone after, they were lost, and no man knewe, where they were become. Of whome also, they for the selfe feare, dyd than delyuer to Brasidas, the nomber of two thousande. And the other he hadde caryed out of the countrey of Peloponese,What y• witte vndestā
                     ding and good renome of a Capitayne of warre is worth. for, soulde and wages. For he desyred greatly to haue that charge, for which cause, ye Lacedemonians dyd sende hym, and also the Chalcides desired hym greatly, for that, that amonges all them of Sparte, he was reputed to be a diligence and industrious parsone. Also he obteigned a great bruyte by that charge. For he shewed himsel
                     •
                   so honest a man and so good a iusticer and pollitique in all thinges, that manye townes and cyties by reason thereof, came to render themself to hym. And some he toke by diligence and treason, whereby, that chaunced to the Lacedemonians, that they hoped of, to wytt, that they recouered many of their landes, and caused some of those of the Athenians, thereby to reuolte and rebelle. And for a certayne tyme, dyd putt and absente the warre out of their quarter of Peloponese. And afterwardes, in the warre, that was bitwene the Athenians & the Peloponesiās in Sicille, his vertue was so knowen & estemed, aswell by experience, as by relaciō of other, that by that reason, many of those that toke the partie of the Atheniās, desired to take that same of the Peloponesians. For, seing the vertue & goodnes that was in hym, they persumed & iudged, that the other Lacedemonians shuld be all lyke. And for to come againe to the purpose, whereof we speake, after, that the Athenians vnderstode the comyng of that same Brasidas into Pel
                     •

And they were more diligente to watche the people of that same quarter, than they had bene bifore. Perdiccas, than hauyug the succors of the Peloponesians with Brasidas, brought them with his army against Archibeus sonne of Bromerus king of Lyncesters Macedoniane, who was his neyghboure and his greate enemye.

For to knowe if by woordes and declaracions, he myght bryng hym to the deuocion and amytie of the Lacedemonians. For the same Archibeus hadde caused to be signefyed by sounde of trompette,Archibeus. that for the differences that were bitwene hym and Perdiccas, he woulde be and stande to the iudgemente and saying of Brasidas. Also the Chalcydes, that desired to bryng the sayd Brasidas to their affaire, shewed and perswaded hym that he shoulde not busye hymself with a longe and difficille warre, at the appetite and desyre of Perdiccas. Consideryng specially that those men, that Perdiccas had sent to Lacedemonie for to haue succous, had proponed & declared, that he would cause that many of his neyghbours should be reduced to the amitie of the sayd Lacedemonians. And therefore with good cause prayed him, that he would be content to appoinet ye same differēce for the publique weale of the Peloponesians, and of hymself. Whereunto Perdiccas woulde not consente

saying that he hadde not called Brasidas, for to be iudge of his questions, but for to ayde him, to discounfyte his ennemyes, suche, as he shuld declare, and that the same Brasidas dydde hym great wronge to beare Archibeus agaynst hym.

               Howe the Athenians at the persuatiō of Brasidas, lefte the partie, of the Athenians. And did take the same of the Peloponesians. The .xi. Chapter.
               SOone after that, a lytle bifore the vintage, that selfe somer, Brasidas hauing the Chalcydes with him, came to make warre against the cytie of Acanthe,Acanthus. which was a colonie of the Andrians. And the citizens were in great controuersie, whider they shuld receyue him into the cytie or not. To wirt those, that toke parte wt the Chalcides on the one syde, and the comon people on the other partie. But bicause of this, that the fruytes were yet in the feldes, the comon people, vpon the perswation, was content that he shulde enter into ye towne alone, & speake what he would. And afterwardes they would determyne what they had to do. Who, being entred and come to the assemblie of the people, he spake veray sagely, as he welle coulde do. For that, that he was a Lacedemonian, and sayd vnto them in this manner.
               
                  The oracion of Brasidas to the Acanthyans.
                  THis, that I haue been here sent with this armye by the Lacedemonians (Lordes Acanthiens) declareth sufficiētly: that the cause, for the whiche we haue proclaymed and published from the begynnyng, to haue moued the warre against the Athenians: is true & veritable: to wytt, for to delyuer Grece out of seruitude. And if we haue slacked to come hyther, being deceiued by the hope, that we haue had to haue vainquished ye Athenians more sonner: we ought not therefore to be reprehended. Considered, that thereby ye arne not incurred into any dāgier. And we come nowe whā we may, for to defeate the Athenians, with you, through our power. But I am greatly abashed of this, that ye shutt me out of the gates, where I thought to be by you receyuedde with greate ioy, and that ye shulde haue desired greatly my coming. For we other Lacedemonians, thynkyng of the occasion and chance of thynges, that we haue made to come hither, as to oure good frendes, and to those, that shulde desire oure comyng: we haue enterprised this voiage, without hauing regarde to dāgers, wherein we did putt our self, by passyng through so long space of lande and of strange countreis, for to shewe the good wille, that we haue towardes you. And if you haue an other wille, or be mynded to resist them, that shoulde purchase the lybertie of all Grece: ye shall do naughtely. Aswell for that, that ye shall empesche youre oune lybertie, as also for thys, that ye shall geue yll example vnto other, not to obey and receyue vs. Whiche shall bee a thynge vn

                     yttyng for this cytie, whiche is puissante and reputed prudente. That we being firste addressed vnto the same, ye haue notte hadde wylle to receyue vs. And also I cannot thynke that ye haue any reasonable cause to do it

except it should be sayd that aither I would perswade you to an vn
                        •
                     ust and vnreasonable lybertie: orells that we be not puissant ynough for to defende you against the Athenians, if they would herefore inuade you. Which thing ye ought not to feare. For if I, being come to the succours of Nysee with this armye that I haue here, they durst not come to fight wt me, truly it is is not to be beleued, yt they woll sende hither so great an armye by lande, as they sent thider by sea. And as to the other poynct, I do aduertis you, yt I am hider sente by the Lacedemonians, not for to do hurte nother damage vnto Grece: but for to restore it into lybertie. And I haue made greate othes into the hādes of our officers, to suffre: al thē, that I shall bring into our allyance to lyue in libertie, & af
                        •
                     er their lawes. Wherefore ye ought welle to knowe, that I am not come for to drawe you by force or by deceite & trompery, vnto our allyance: but the contrary, in delyuering you from the saruitude of the Atheniās, for to ioigne you in this warre with vs, against thē. And therefore I thinke that ye ought to haue confidence in me that make vnto you so great fayth of that, whiche I speake. And for to geue you couraige, I am come puissante ynough, for to defende you. And if there be any that doubteth herein, fearing for his particularitie, that I woll not geue & deliuer the gouernement of the towne to any one particuler amonges you, I wou
                        •
                     d that he had more confidence & suertie, than thoder. For I do certifie you that I am not come to moue any sedicion, nor mutyne among you. But also me thinketh, that I shulde not restore you into free and true lybertie, if changing youre aunciente fourme of lyuing, I shuld putt the cōmon people into the subieccion of any particulers, or any perticulers to the subieccion of the comon people. For that, that I vnderstande welle, that the same dominion & rule shulde be more odious and hated vnto you, than that same of estrangers. And thereby vnto vs Lacedemonians, shuld not be due any pleasure nor huyer for the payne, that we haue taken for your cause. But in stede of the glory and honor, that we attende and loke for thereby, we ought to be blaymed, and shulde be charged of the self vice, that we impute vnto the Athenians. Whiche shulde be somuche more vnsittyng & more worthy of reprehension vnto vs than vnto them: that we attribute to our selues this vertue, and prayse, to witt, not to vse tromperie or deceite. Which thing they do not. For albeit that deceite be vnsittyng in al men: yett is it more vnsemely in them, that be in moste dignitie. And also it is woorse & more d

                      that violence ouercometh by vertue, & auctoritie of the force, that fortune geueth to the one, ouer the other: but tromperie and deceyte procedeth and cometh of an vnreasonable, mischeuous and very malyce. To all which thinges we haue a great circumspection and a great regarde, in treatyng and cō
                     ductyng the great affaries. And also I wolle not that you trust so muche in my othe, as in the experience of thinges, & to that, whereof you shall see the effectes, correspondent to reasons, whiche is ryght requisitt for you, as I haue shewed you. But also vnderstāde, that if you hauing harde this my proposicion woll excuse yourself, saying that ye cannot do that, which we woll: & that ye woll require vs, as your frendes, that we retire without doing any hurt or damage vnto you, pretending that you haue this lybertie without danger and that it ought to bee offred and presented to them, that maye haue it without danger, and that none shuld be cōstrayned to take it: I will protest bifore the goddes and the sainctes, whiche haue this cytie in keping, ye being come hider for your welth, I coulde nothing proffitt with you by wordes. And I woll essay by wasting and destroying your feldes, whider that I may constrayne you thereunto. Perswadyng my self to do it for a good and iust cause, and not wrongfully, for two necessary reasons.

The one for the welth of the Lacedemonians, to the ende yt they shuld not suffer damage for your loue, permitting you in this sorte, paying the monney, whiche you fournishe to the Atheniās: the other for ye weale of al the Grekes, to thintent that by you, they be not lett & empesched to recouer their libertie. For if that were not, we shuld well vnderstāde, that no mā ought to be constraigned by force to sett himself againe into libertie (and specially we Lacedemonians) if it be not, for some comon and publique wealth. And yet neuerthelas we wolle not haue any other gouernance or rule ouer you, but to delyuer you from the subiection of other. And we shulde do iniury vnto many: if by restoring to all other their right of lybertie, we shuld leaue you in this estate, & shuld endure your resistēce. wherfore Lordes, take good aduyse herin, & be authors vnto al y• Grekes. And shewe them the waye to recouer their lybertie, aswel for to acquire & gett this perpetuell glory to haue bene the first: as also for to exchue ye damage, that otherwayes may chaunce vnto you in your perticuler goodes: & moreouer to thende, that ye geue to this your citie a right honest & glorious name, to be a franke & free citie. After that Brasidas had thus spoken vnto the people, they debated longe, vpon this mater. And finally they came to geue vp their opinions by small billes secretly. And the greatest parte were founde of opinion to departe frō the allyance of the Athenians, aswell for the persuation of Brasidas, as also for feare to lose their goodes, that were in the feldes. And hauing receiued othe of the same Brasidas, that he had comission of the Lacedemonians, for to sett them againe into their lybertie, that shuld render themself vnto him, and to suffer them to lyue according to their lawes: they su

               Howe Hippocrates & Demosthenes, Dukes of the Athenians, made an entreprise vpon the countrey of Beotians. Wherein they alwayes failled to their greate losse and disaduantage. ☞The .xii. Chapter.
               IN begynning of the winter, Hippocrates and Demosthenes, Dukes of the Athenians, hauing ordoned and concluded their enterprise, touching the feate of the Beoeians: yt thone, to wytt. Demosthenes shuld mete with the army by sea at Syphas,Siphe. & thother wt tharmy by lande at Delos,Delos. lyke as is aboue declared: it happened by errour, that they mett not at the day named in the sayd places. But Demosthenes, being first aryued at Syphas with many shippes of the Acarnanians and of the other allyes: his enterprise was discouered by an Phocian, named Nichomachus,Nichomachus Who aduertised the Lacedemoniās thereof, & they aduertised the Beocians, whiche did putt thēself al in armure. And Hippocrates, not hauing yet done any thing on the coste of the firme lande touching the exploict of warre: they all came to the succours of Syphas & of Cheronee.Cheronea. Whereby, those of the cyties, that had made treatie with the Atheniās, seing that the thing was discouered: durst make no inuocaciō. Neuertheles, after yt the sayd Beotians were retourned into their houses: Hippocrates, hauing caused all the citizens and inhabitantes of Athenians to putt them in armure, he came to Delos, & assieged the temple of Apollo, in this māner. For they inclosedde the outwarde parte of the temple with dyches and with a walle, whiche they made of earthe, and thereupon they planted pales with pykes and

beyonde the walle, they made rampers of bricque & of stone, whiche they toke of the houses nigh vnto them, that they had beaten downe. And vpō the rampars, they erected also towers & defences in many places. In suche manner that there remaigned no parte of the tēple, that was not enclosed. For also there was no other edifice & building aboute thesame. For that, that an aūtient cloistre, that had of aunciētie bene there: was wtin a shorte time bifore fallen downe. And that same worke, they acheued & finished within two dayes & a halfe, after that they were there ariued. And also that they had spēt in coming, but three dayes. And that being throughly made, the army departed fromthence, and retyred aboutes eight stades: as for to retourne into their houses. And incontinently all the footemen lightly armed, which were in a right great nomber, went their way. the other vnarmed themself and abodde in a village, for to repose and soiurne there. And Demosthenes, with a small nomber of people, taried at Delos for the keping of the rampars, & to acheue and finishe that, whiche was to do. Nowe were the Beotians in thies self dayes, assembled at Tanagra.Tanagra. Being than there assembled out of all the countrey: they were in doubte whider that they shulde assaille the sayd Athenians or not. For of elleuene officers and gouernours of the

                  ayd countrey, tenne sayd that it ought not to be done, for so muche as the sayd Atheniās were not yet entred into the countrey of Beoce. For the place wherein they reposed themself: was in the lymyttes of Oropie.Oropia. But Pagondas,Pagondas. sonne of Goladas of Thebes, which was one of the sayd gouernours, and Arianthides,Arianthides. sonne of Lesymachus, who had at that tyme the charge of that assembly were of contrarye opinion. And specially the sayd Pagondas, who, estemyng and iudgyng that it was for the best, to proue fortu

                  The oraciō of Pagōdas vnto the souldiers Beotiās.
                  IT was not conuenable to any of you, that be in office (Lordes Beotians) to thinke that we shulde not fight agaynst the Athenians, except they were founde within our lande. For hauing dressed and appoynted their munitions & fortifications within our countrey of Beoce: and being departed out of their nigh places, to the intent to trouble it: there is no doubt, but that we shulde take them for ennemyes, in what parte: that we shall fynde them. For out of whatsoeuer parte that they come: they haue declared themself to be ours. Wherefore if any one among you were heretofore of aduyse, that they shuld not be fought with, lett hym change fromhensfourthe his opinion. For so muche as there ought not somuche regarde to be had to thē, that holde their oune, and wolle trouble an other mans for couetice to haue more: as to those, ye wolle inuade men to take their lande frō them. And if you haue lerned of youre auncesters to repoulse youre ennemyes of a strange nation out of your lande, both nigh, & a farre of: truly you ought muche more readely to do it against the Athenians yt be youre neighbours. For that, yt it is more conuenable for euery man, for to defende & kepe his libertie & his right against his neighbours, for to be egall vnto thē: than against other, being more further of. And therfore if theis here doe trauaile to bring into their subieccion & seruitude, those, yt be veray farre frō them, why shuld not we hazarte & aduenture to fight vnto the last mā of vs against thē that be euen their voy
                        •
                     ns & neighbours? hauing bifore our eyes the example of Eubeens, and one greate parte of Grece. And seing howe they haue brought them into subiection, why shulde we not consider that the other nexte adioigning do fight with them for to kepe & defende their lymittes? but if we be

vainquishedde, there shalbe no lymitte in our territory. But rather it shalbe holy cōfused. For after that they shalbe entred therinto by force: we shalbe in danger
                        •
                      lest that they wolle possesse and occupie it hooly muche more than the other borderers. For that, that they there haue already muche lande, and also do holde one parte therof. And also it is the custome of chose, which trusting in their forces, be mynded to warre vpon their neighbours as the Atheniās nowe do: to assaille sonner those, yt be in rest, & go not diligently about to defende & kepe their lande: than those that wolle be readye to mete with them, whan they come to assaille thē, and also to begyn the warre, if they see occasion, like as we may see by experience. For after that we had vainquished them at Cheronee, whan they did possesse oure lande through the sedicion and diuision of oure people, we haue alwayes holden all our countrey of Beoce in greate suertie. Whereof, we ought to haue remembrance. And those that be of that tyme, shulde parforce themself to be suche, as they than were. And those, that be yonger, descended of those vailliante men, shulde not degenerate from their vertue, nor suffre to perishe in them, the glory that their auncesters, haue purchased and acquired for them. Hauyng moreouer confidence that that same God wolbe helpyng vnto vs: whose temple they holde oultragiously assieged. Consideryng chiefly that the sacrifices, whiche we haue made, do geue vs a good significacion and hope of the victorye Let vs thinke and studye therefore, to mustre, & cause the Athenians to knowe, that if they haue obteyned any one of the thynges whiche they coueted, by force, it hath bene agaynste people that defended not themself. But whan they enterprised against people, which haue accustomed by their vertue and magnanymytie to defende their lande and their lybertie: not being mynded vniustly to enterprise and subdue the lybertie of other: they haue neuer retourned without being fought with. Through thies woordes Pagondas perswaded the Beotians to go against the Athenians, and incontinently dislodged from their campe, for to mete with them forthwith, though that it was alreadye darke. And they came and lodged thēself very nigh, vnto them. But there was a certaine small mount bitwene both, whereby the one coulde not see the other, and there he did put his men in battaille for to go to fight agaynste the sayd Athenians. Nowe had Hippocrates (who remayned at Delos) been aduertised, howe the Beotians were yssued fourth with greate furye of the people. And so commaunded them that were in the campe, that they shulde kepe themself in armure, & shulde be at their defence, and sone after, he came thider himself with the people that he hadde, reserued three houndred onely: whiche he left at Delos, all horsemen, aswell for to kepe the fortifications, as also for to come to the succours of the army, if it were nedeful. The Beotians than hauing sent auancurrers for to putt the ennemyes in feare and disorder, they came to the highe of the mountaigne and were in the viewe and sight of the ennemyes all ready to fyght. And they were aboute seuen thousande well armed, and more than tenne thousande lightly armed, and aboutes a thousande and fyue houndred horsemen, bearyng shieldes. And they had in this maner ordeyned their battaille. That the footemen, that is, the Thebains & their allyes

And so the formoste came to the conflicte and strokes And though that the hyndermost dyd not stryke, yet were they asmuche trauailled as the othere, by cause of the sprynges, whyche of necessitie they shulde passe. Beynge than hande for hande, they repoulsedde the one the other wyth targattes and bucklars. And anone the lefte poyncte or wynge of the Beotyans, was recuyled and repoulsed by the Athenyans, vnto the myddeste. who did alwayes set on theym, for to destroye the othere, that were in the same wynge. Chiefly, the Thespyans, whyche were in that quarter. And all at ones, dyd slay the other, that had bene repoulsed & were all in an heape locked, the one agaynst ye other. And they dyd hurt the sayd Thespyans, who defended themself galliardly. In whyche sturre and conflycte, manye of the Athenyans were there slayne by their oune people. For that, that myndynge to enclose their ennemyes, they brought thēself into the myddest of them: in suche wyse, that the one knewe not the othere, but fynally that ryghte poyncte was hooly repoulsed.

they kepte the temples, whyche were bifore bilongyng to the same inhabitantes: as their owne. And therfore the sayde Athenyans intended, if they dyd get theire lande, to vse the self ryght and lawe. And for that cause, beynge in that same coū

But beinge there, for to auenge themselfe of those, that came to ouerronne their lande, they were of necessitie constrayned for to take therof, to their vse. In whych case, whan there ys true warre: to those that be in necessitie, it is conuenable that God do pardone them: that whyche they be constrayned to do of necessytie. For recours is had to the goddes and to the aulters, for to obteigne remyssyon of synnes, whyche be not commytted wyllingly. And those be estemed euyll and synners towardes them, whych synne wyllingly, and not those, that do any thynge of necessitie. But those oughte muche more to be estemed euyll and contempnors of goddes: whyche for rendrynnge of deade corpses, wold haue the tēples: rather than those: which for not rendring of holly thynges: refuse to take that whyche raysone wolde to be rendred vnto them. And thys they declared that they were not determyned to departe oute of the lande of Beoce. For they pretended to kepe ye place, wherin they were wyth good right and not by force. And yett ueuertheles, they demaūded of the said Beotians, that they shulde permytt them for to fetche away their deade men accordynge to the custome of Grece. To thys demaunde and proposition the Beotians answered, that if the sayd Athenyans dydde take it to be in the lande of the Beotians, they shulde departe wyth their baguage. And if they pretendedde to be in theirs, they knewe what they hadde to do. For the lande of Oropie, wherin their people were slayn, was in the iurisdictyon of the sayde Athenyans. wherefore those Beotians, not kepynge their deade men agaynst their will, they were not bounde to render them vnto them, but departinge from their lande, yt was very raysonable, that that thynge, whyche they demaunded, shulde be delyuered. In this manner retourned the heraulte of the Athenyans wythout doynge any thynge. And anone after, the Beotians, hauynge caused a certayne nomber of slingers and darte casters to comme from Malie wyth two thousande good souldiars on fote,Malea. which the Corinthians had sente vnto them incontynently after the battaille, and some other succours, whyche was comme vnto them frō Peloponese, to wyt of those, that were retourned fro Nisee wyth the Megaryans: they departed from thence and wente to laye their campe bifore Delos. And they assayled the fortifications & rampares of the Athenyans wyth dyuers Engynes of Artillery.The inuention of a new Engine to assaulte & Bartre. and amonge other, by one, whyche was cause of the takynge of yt, the whyche was of thys facion. They dyd take a greate piece of timber and made it hollowe all wythin, in suche manner, that it was voyde and hollowe all alonge. Afterwardes they fastened yt wyth yrone at bothe endes. And also alengthe, very artyfyciallye, aftere manner of a pipe, and to one of the endes they fastened wyth chaynes of yronne a greate cawdrone of brasse, whyche hanged from the sayd piece of tymber, downewardes by the sayd chaynes. And at the ende of the beame, there was a hollowe pype of yronne whyche tourned and crooked downewarde agaynste the cawldrone, for to caste ryghte into the cauldrone, the wynde, that came alonge oute of the ingyne. the whyche, beinge so acheuedde and made as ys aboue sayd they caused it to be drawin and caryed wyth greate charettes vnto the walle, whiche the Athenyans had made, on that syde, where the mooste parte was of woode. And in raysinge yt vp, they dyd sett the ende, wheron the cauldrone was, vnto the

Thus the temple of Delos was recoueredde .xvii dayes after the battaille. And soone after retourned the heraulte of the Athenyans (which dyd knowe nothing of the sayd takinge or recouerey) for to demaunde agayn the dead men.

And than the Athenyans .xxxii. yeres after, sent thyder tēne thousand mē, aswel of their people, as of other assembled frō all quarters, whych were all destroyde by the Thracians nyghe vnto Dranesque. Notwythstanding .xxix yeares after, those same Athenians sente thider agayne of their people, vnder the conducte of Agnon, sonne of Nycias. who chased the Edonyans fromthence, and

founded the cytie, suche, as yt presently is, whyche was bifore named, the newe wayes. And whan the sayd Agnon came thyder to make it, he departed frome a towne, whiche the Athenyans had in the mouthe of the ryuer, named Eionus.Eione. wherein they made theire estaple, and called it Amphipolis, by cause that it was enuyronned on both sydes wyth the ryuer of Strymone, and so enclosed it wyth a wall that wente from one arme of the ryuer, vnto the other. And builded it in a place of a conuenyent heyght: so that it was fayre to se, aswelle towarde the sea, as to the lande. Brasidas, than beinge at Arnes,Arne. whyche is a towne in the terrytorye of the Agryans: departed fromthence wyth hys army, and arryued aboute goynge downe of the sonne in Aulone and in Bromisque,Aulon Bromiscus. on that syde where the lake of Bolbus voydeth itselfe into the sea.Bolbe And after that he had supped, he toke hys iourney in the nyght (whyche was very darke, and also it did snowe, and was veray foule whether) so that he aryued bifore the cytie, wythout beinge parceued by them, that were wythin. Resarued some, wyth whom he had intelligence, whiche were partly of the Argylians, that be in the countrey of Andrie & were come thider, for to inhabitt: and partly of other, whyche had be practised and wonne, aswell by Pardiccas, as by the Chalcides. But pryncipally the Brasides, whyche was adioygninge vnto them, were of that intelligence and confederacy, and had bene alwayes ennemys of the Athenyans: and espyed and layd in wayte to take pryuely the sayd cytie. Those same than that were inhabitedde there as afore ys sayde: hauinge concluded the treasone wyth Brasydas, by consente of them, whiche than had the gouernance of the cytie, dyd suffre him to come in. And the same night they, rebellinge frō the Athenyans, came to lodge wyth the army of Brasidas, nighe the bridge, that was on the ryuer, distant a verye small space frome the cytie. whych was not thā closed wyth walles: as it presently ys. And though that there was a nomber of people, that kepte the brydge, yet aswell by cause of the nyghte, as of the foule wether, and also of the soubdayne arryuall, he repoulsed them easely and wonne the brydge, and dyd take all the cytezeins, that dwelled wythoute the cytie in the suburbs, except some small nomber, whyche saued themselfe in the towne, wherof, they that were wythin were greatly afrayed, and chiefly for that, that they greatly doubted amonge thēself, the one, the other. And the sayinge ys, that if Brasidas had aswell approued to take the cytie, as he suffred hys people to pillage the suburbs: he had than takene yt. But in the meane tyme that hys people did geue themselfe to pillaige, those of the cytie assuredde themselfe, in suche manner, that he durste not pursue hys enterpryse, chiefly parceyuynge that they of hys intelligence did not discouer theymselfe in the towne. whyche thinge they coulde not do, forsomuche as the Cytezeins, who where in the greater nomber, empesched and dyd lett that the gates were not opened. And sent wyth all diligence, by the counsell of Eucles, who than was Capytayne of the Athenyans, vnto Thucydides sonne of Olerus, the same that hath writtone thys historie (whyche at that tyme had charge for the Athenyans in the sayde countrey of Thrace, wyth the sayde Eucles,Eucleus. beinge nyghe the towne of Thase, whyche was a colonie of the Paryans, distante frome Amphipolis aboute one iourney by sea) that he shuld come to succour them. whyche thynge he readelye dyd, and came fromthence wyth seuene shypps, whyche he founde by aduenture all ready in that parte, to succour Amphipolis, if it were not than takene, or if it were takene, for to take Eione. In thys meane tyme Brasidas, who greatly fearedde the succours of Thase by sea, and also leaste Thucydides,Thucidides. who kept in that quarter many mynes of golde and of syluer, by meane wherof, he hadde greate frendeshypp and authorytie wyth the principallest of the coūtrey, shuld assemble

a great nomber of people by land, he determyned to do hys beste to gett the said cytie by practyse & cōposytion, bifore that the cytezeins mighte haue ye sayde succour. And for that cause he made it to be cryed and published wyth the sounde of a trompett, that all they, that were in the towne, beinge citezeins or Athenyans, myghte if they thought good, abyde in their estate and lybertie. Euen so, as the Peloponesyans. And those, that wolde not, might departe wyth their baguaige wythin fyue dayes. whyche crye beinge harde, many of the pryncipall Cytezeins changed their opynyon, vnderstandyng to be by that meane in lybertie. whereas the cytie at the presente tyme was gouerned, the moste parte by the Athenyans. And also they, whose parentes and frendes were takene in the suburbs, whyche were in greate nomber, all meane people, fearynge, that if they dyd it not, their sayd parentes and frendes shulde be yll intreated, chy

And by thys meane, the cytie was rendred. That self same day aboute the euenynge tyde, Thucidides arryued wyth hys ships at Eione. Brasidas, beinge already wythin Amphipolis. who had taken the sayd cytie of Eione yf the night had not come vpon hym. And also at the breake of the day he had taken yt, if the succours wyth the sayd shypps had not arryued. But the same Thucydides, beinge there arryued as is afore sayd, ordeyned hys case for to defende the towne, if Brasidas wold haue come to assaylle yt, & also that he myght wythdrawe and receyue those of the mayne lande, that were mynded to comme to ioygne wyth hym. wherby yt chaunced that Brasidas, who was descended a longe the ryuer wyth a good nomber of shypps, hauynge made hys strength to gett a rocke that was at the mouth of the same, nighe the towne, and after to take yt by the land syde, was repoulsed from both sides, and was constraigned to retourne into the cytie of Amphipolis, for to geue order to the affayres therof.

For that, that it hadde bene muche propice and profytable to them, aswell by reasone of the monney, that they there leuyed, and of the woode that they dyd take fromthence for to make shipps: as also for that the Lacedemonyans, hauinge bifore facultie and power to comme to inuade the allyes of the sayde Athenyans, vnto the ryuer of Strymone, by the conducte of the Thracyans, who dyd take their parte, coulde not passe ouer the water at the vpper parte therof, for that, that it was depe, nor also wyth boatts, so longe as the Athenyans dyd kepe their watche vpon the water at Eyone. But the Lacedemonyans, hauinge gottene the cytie, and consequently the passage of the ryuer, myght passe at their wylle and pleasure. whereby the Athenyans were in greate feare, that their frendes and allyes woolde tourne to take parte wyth the sayd Lacedemonyans. Chyefly for thys, that Brasidas, beside that, that he declared and shewed hymself to be a man curtoys and reasonable: dyd also publishe

generally euery where, that he had no charge, but to restoore all Grece into lybertie. By meane wherof, the other townes and cyties, that dyd take parte wyth the Athenyans, vnderstandynge the good entreatynge, whyche the sayde Brasidas vsedde and practysedde towards the Amphilochiens, and that he presented lyberte vnto euery man: they were all enclyned to reuolte and tourne vnto hym, and to wythdrawe themself from the obeissaunce of the Athenians. And thereupon dydde secretely sende their heraultes and messengers towardes hym, for to make their appoynctement: euery man, desyring to be the furste, thynking that there was none daunger of the Athenyans, who of longe tyme hadde nott any greate garnysons in that countrey: and thought not that their puissance had bene so greate, as they parceyuedde it afterwardes to be by experyence.

And that thynge whyche they wylledde not, they reprouedde vnder coloure of reasone. Also they grounded themself greately vpon the losse, whyche the Athenyans had made frankly in Beoce, through occasyon whereof, it semedde to them, that they coulde not soo soone sende succours into that quarter, and the more by the perswasyons of Brasidas, who dydde theym to vnderstande. that the sayd Athenyans durste not fyghte againste hym nygh to Nysee, though that he hadde, but thys a

Through thies reasons, and vpon thies ymagynations, they were all ioyous for the presente, to be in lybertie vnder the protection of the Lacedemonyans, whome they thoughte, hauynge newely made the enterpryse in that same quarter, to be fully determyned to followe it to their power. On the othere syde the Athenyans, consyderinge the daunger, sente fourthwyth succours into the sayde quarter for to kepe and defende their lande, although it were wynter tyme. Also Brasidas hadde wrytton vnto them of Lacedemonye, that they shuld sende vnto him succours. And in the meane tyme he woulde cause to be made asmanye shyppes, as he coulde, in the ryuer of Strymone. But the Lacedemonyans did sende him no succours, aswel through occasyō of the discorde of the princypallest of the cytie: as also for that, that the people desired to recouer the prysonners, whyche were takene in the Islande, and by that meane, rather to make peace: than to contynue the warre.

And forsomuche, as Sanius and Dyus resisted him, he pyllaged & wasted their terrytory. And neuerthelas, seinge that he could not tourne them, he departed fromthence and wente agaynste Torone,Torona in the countrey of Chalcyde, whiche dyd take parte wyth the Athenyans by the practise and sollycytinge of somme of the Cytezeins, that hadde promysedde to lett him into yt. And so he iourneyed all the nyghte, that aboute the breake of the daye, he arryued at the temple of Castor and Pollur, whyche is distante from the cytie aboutes three stades, wythoute that, that annye nomber of the Athenyans, whyche were wythin the towne for to kepe it, did parceue anny thynge thereof in anny of the Cytezeins. Those resaruedde that were of the treatie. Somme of whome, vnderstandynge hys commynge, dydde take and receyue seuene of hys men onely into yt: whyche bare no armure but their swerdes. and yet feared not to enter wythoute theire compaignyons, whyche were in all to the nomber of twenty vnto whome Brasydas hadde geuene thys charge vnder the conducte of Lysistratus the Olynthyen.Lisistratus.

                  pe to the toppe of a hyghe tower: whyche was scituatedde vponne a hylle. and dyd slaye those, that were wythin for to kepe yt. And afterwards dyd breake vp a lytle gate that was on the syde of Canestre. Thys indurynge, Brasidas wt all the armye was marchedde, a lytle more nyghe vnto the cytie, and attendinge and waytynge the issue of the thynge, he hadde sente bifore one houndredde fote men well armed for to be ready to enter into yt, fourthwyth as they shuld parceyue anny of the gates of the towne opened, and the signe, that they from with in the towne shulde geue, were shewed. whyche came ryght secretly almoost vnto the walles. In the meane tyme, they of the towne that had made the treatie, preparedde themselfe, wyth the seuene, that were entredde, for to gett the cytie: and that the gate shulde be openedde for them, whyche fyrmed and dyd shut in, the markett place. They than parceyuynge the sayde houndred theire compaignyons to be so nyghe: causedde to be shewedde vnto somme of them the passage, alonge the walles, and receyuedde theym in by the lytle gate, whyche was gottone. To the intente, that they, that were in the cytie and knewe nothynge of the enterpryse: parceyuynge themselfe assaylled byfore and behynde, shulde be soubdaynely the more afrayedde. And after they had made the signe or tokene wyth fyer whyche they hadde geuen to Brasidas, they receyuedde the other of the said houndred into the cytie by the gate of the markett place. whan Brasidas didde see the tokenne, he marched wyth the reste of hys people in the greateste haste, that he myghte, agaynste the cytie, makynge a muche greate noyse and crye, for the more, to feare the Cytezeins. And so some entredde at the gates, whych they founde openne, and the other mountedde vp by the beames that were fastenedde in the walle on one of the sydes, where it was brokene. And after that they were all entred, Brasidas made strayghte fourth to the hygheste of the cytie, and frō
                  thence came to disturbe and ouerronne it, throughe all the partes and streetes therof, to the ende, that he myght be wholy seased of yt. And in this doynge, the Cytezeins, whyche hadde not bene consentynge to the takynge of yt, went about to saue theymselfe the beste that they myghte. But they that were of the intellygence, came to ioygne themselfe wyth the Lacedemonyans. As touchynge the

Athenyans that were in the market place, for the saulfgarde of the towne, to the nomber of fyftie Soldyars, there was one parte of them taken sleping and was slayne, at the aryuall. The other, parceyuinge the bruyte, saued themself, some by lande and the other in two shyps: that kepte watche vpon the ryuer, and wente fromthence vnto Lecythum. where was one other garnysonne of Athenes. And toke at the arryuall the Castell of the cytie Marytimate or next the sea, whiche was in the mooste straighte or narroweste place of the distreate. withe whome, many of the cytezeins of the sayd Torone dydde retyre and withdrawe themself, to wytte, of those, that were moste affectyonedde to the partie of the Athenyans. The daye comme and the cytie being wholy in the puissance of Brasidas: he causedde it to be cryedde wyth the sownde of a trompette through the towne, that all they, whyche were retyredde wyth the Athenyans, myghte retourne in suertie, and shulde recouer their goodes and contynue in the rytes of the cytie, like as they hadde done byfore tyme And on the othere syde, he commaundedde the Athenyans, that were wythin Lecythum,Lecithū
                   that they shulde voyde and departe fromthence, for that, that it apperteigned to the Chalcydians, suffrynge them to departe fromethence wyth theire baguaige. But they made aunswere that they wolde not departe, and yet neuerthelas they demaundedde of Brasidas one day of trefues for to wythdrawe their deade bodyes. who grauntedde vnto theyme twoo dayes, durynge the whyche, he furnyshed hys fortes. Lykewyse dydde the Athenyans, theirs. And besydes thys he dydde assemble the cytezeins of Torone, and spake vnto them almoste in that same sorte, as he hadde spokene to themof Acanthe in thys substance.
               
                  The narration of Brasidas vnto the Toronyans.
                  THat is, that he shewedde them, that raysonne woulde not, that they, whyche had hadde intelligence wyth him for to lett hym into the cytie, shulde be reputedde traiters nor euyll doers. Forsomuche as they hadde done it nothere for monney, nother for to brynge the cytie into seruytude: but rathere for to restore yt into lybertie, and for the greate wealthe of the cytezeins generallye. Also yt were not raysonne, that they, whyche were not parttakers of thys goodnes, shulde be depryued of theire goodes and faculties, for he was not come thyder for to destroye ye cytie, nor any of the Cytezeins: but for to delyuer it oute of captyuitie. And for thys cause he hadde done yt to bee knowen to theym that were gone wyth the Athenyans, that they might comme agayne into theire goodes, and into the estate, that they were in, in tymes passed. To the intente that all men myghte knowe, that the amytye of the Lacedemonyans (whan they shalle haue prouedde yt) was nott worser, than that same of the Athenyans and shulde haue cause to be somuche the moore affectionedde to theire partie
                        •
                      as they shulde fynde theym by experyence, more iuste and more reasonable. Though that at the beginninge they hadde bene afraied, not hauinge yet experymēted the nature of the said Lacedemonyans. Praying and exhorting them, that they wolde dispose themself to be theire good and faythfull frendes & confederates, from that houre, forwardes. For if they afterwardes cōmitted any faulte, they shulde be coulpable and punishable. whyche thynge bifore tyme they had not desarued, but rather they, that had by force holden them in subiection, as the more stronge. wherefore though they had euenne vnto that present houre bene aduersaryes and contrary to the sayd Lacedemonyans
                        •
                      yet raysone wolde that it shuld be pardoned them. With such words Brasidas exhorted & cōforted

the Toronyans. whan the two dayes of trefues were passed, he came to Lecythus and thought to take yt wyth assaulte. For that, that the walles were very weake in euery place, & in some quarters made of woode. Yet the Athenyās, that were wythin, defended themself valiantly the furste daye, and repoulsed the Lacedemonyans. The morowe followynge, Brasidas had caused to be set vp an instrumente for to cast fyer into that parte, where the walls were of woode. which parceyuedde, the Athenyans raysedde vp a towre of woode vpon the sayde wals in the selfe same parte: and there caused to be sett a greate nomber of vessels full wyth water, wyth instrumentes for to caste yt fourthe

                      and also greate stones. But throughe the greate nomber of people that moūted vpon the same tower, it did fall soubdaynely downe to the grounde. whereby and wyth the brute that it made in fallynge: the Athenyans whyche were nyghe yt, were moore displaysedde, than afrayedde. But they, whyche were furthere of: thynkynge that the towne hadde bene takenne, fledde awaye towardes the sea into the shyppes, that were in the poorte. Than Brasidas, parceyuy

                     ge that they hadde habandonedde and forsakene the walle, assayled it on that same syde, and toke the towne wythout greate difficultie, by that meane. And they, that were encountred at the arryuall, were 
                        •
                     layne. Yet one partie of the Athenyans sauedde themselfe in the ships and saylledde to Pallenes.Pellene Nowe had Brasidas caused to be cryed bifore the assaulte wyth sownde of trompett, that he woulde geue .xxx. poundes in syluer to the furste that shulde haue mountedde vpon the wall. But persuadinge hymself that the towne was taken rather by wylle of the goddes, than by force: he dyd geue that sōme of monney to the temple of the goddesse Pallas, whyche was in the same towne. wyth whyche monney, that same temple was reparedde, which hadde bene destroyed at the takynge of the same towne, wyth the other edifices. And yet afterwardes Brasidas caused it to be buylded agayne. And he was the reste of the wynter, in that same quarter, repayringe and fortefyinge the places, whyche he dydde holde, and layinge in wayte for them, whyche didde take parte wythe the Athenyans.
               
            
            
               ¶ Howe the Athenyans made trefues for one yeare wyth the Lacedemonyans. ☞The .xv. Chapter.
               IN the begynnynge of the furste vere or sprynge tyde, the Athenyans made a trefues wyth the Lacedemonyans for one yeare. And that the Athenyans dyd: thynkynge that durynge that season, Brasidas wold not haue practysed to wythdrawe their landes, and in the meane tyme to haue fortefyed them, and also hopynge to treate durynge that tyme a fynall peace, yf they parceyuedde that it shulde be good for them. The Lacedemonyans also perswaded themselfe that the sayd Athenyans feared the sayde matters, lyke as it was trewe, and that hauynge by meane of trefues, repose and release of trauailes and paynes, wherin they had bene
                     •
                   they woulde be more enclyned to the peace, and that in that doynge they would render the prysonners whiche they kept, whych was the thyng that the sayd Lacedemonyans most desired and hoped to obteigne yt, makinge the trefues, duringe the tyme, that Brasidas prosperedde. But so longe as the warre contynued, and that he dyd gette of the ennemys, they hopedde not that their sayde people shulde be releasedde and delyuered.

And so the trefues was concluded in thys fourme, for the Athenyans dyd delyuer the articles, whych they demaūded, and the Lacedemonyās made the aunswere, suche, as foloweth.
               
                  The fourme of the trefues bitwene the Athenyans and the Peloponesyans.
                  FUrst we woll that as touchynge the temple and the oracle of Apollo Pythicus, that it be l
                        •
                     efull to all them, that wyl, of aither partie to go thider wythout fraude and wythout feare, for to haue counsaile of the god in the manner accustomedde. Thys article was approued by the Lacedemonyans and by those of their allyes, that were there. who promysed to do all that they myghte, that the Beotyans and Phociens shulde approue and ratefie it, and for that cause they sent their herault vnto them. Secondarely touching the treasure of that same god, whych was pillaged and imbecilled, we woll that men procede againste the transgressours for to punishe them accordinge to theire demerittes, lyke as hath bene accustomedde in suche case, and that we and youe and all other that wylbe comprysed in the trefues, shalle obserue the auncyent ordonances and customes, as touchynge that matter. To thys, aunswered the Lacedemonyans and theire allyes, that they were contente that if the peace were made, aither of the parties shulde be contente wythe his lande, lyke as they presently dyd holde yt. To wytt that the lymitts of the Lacedemonyans shuld be in the quarter of Coryphasius bytwene Bufrades and Tomeus: and ye same of the Athenyans, in Cytheis. And that the one myght not make allyaunce wyth the othere, that those, whych be at Nysea and Mynoa shuld not passe by the way that leadeth from Pylus vnto the temple of Neptune, and from the same tēple, to the temple, whyche leadeth to Mynoa. whyche way also, nother the Megaryans myght passe, nor those, that were wtin the Island, which ye Athenyās had taken. And that the one shuld haue no cōmunicatyon of marchandyse nor of other matter with the others, but that the Athenyās myght vse all that, that they had at the present in Trezena, and all the other landes that remayned vnto them by the treatie, at theire pleasure. And also that they myghte goo by sea vnto theire landes, and to those same of their frendes at their pleasure. And as concerninge the Lacedemonyās, that they myght sayle not wyth longe shypps that go with sayle, but wyth galleys and other shypps that go wyth oares, of the portage of fyue hoūdred talentes. Item that all heraults & ambassadours might go wtoute any empeschemēts wt suche compaigny, as they wold, aswel through the lāde of the Peloponesians, as through the same of the Athenyans, & that aswel by sea as by lande, for to treate thappoinctment. Item that none shulde receyue any fugetyue, bondman nor fre, of thone nor other syde. And as touchinge difference that may aryse, duringe the trefues, among them of the one partie, against those same of the other: the knowlayge & triall thereof apparteigneth to the iudge of the defendour, lyke as it was vsed bifore the warre, and that they shulde be voided and pacefyed by sentence, and not by warre. To thys aunswered the Lacedemoniens and their allyes, that they agrede to all the sayd articles. Afterwardes followed one other of this substāce. And if ye parceue yt there may be had any thyng more honnest and more reasonable than thys, which is aboue sayd, being retourned in to Lacedemony ye may aduertyse vs therof. To thys the Lacedemonyans and their allyes aunswered. They that shall go, hauinge power and authorytie to entreate the matters, maye haue the charge, and authorytie hereof, lyke as youe geue it them. Afterwardes followedde. Thies trefues shal endure for one yeare.

Lyke as the Lacedemonyans and their allyes haue accorded and agrede vnto yt, and haue promysed to kepe it for one yeare, whyche shalle begynne thys presente .xiiii. daye of the moneth, Elaphobolion, that is December. Durynge whyche tyme the heraults and ambassadours may and shall go from the one syde to the other, for to speake and entreate vpon meanes for to ende the warre.

               ¶Howe the trefues bitwene the Peloponesians and the Athenyans was brokene, through cause of the cyties of Scione and of Mende, whyche Brasidas taketh by rebellyon of the Citezeins, from the saide Athenyans. ☞The .xvi. Chapter.
               DUrynge the tyme, that hys trefues was entreated, and that the treatie was confirmed (as is aboue said) the cytie of Scione, nyghe to Pallene, rebelled from the Athenyans, and rendred itself vnto Brasidas, vnder thys colour. Those Scionians dyd saye,Sciona that they were Pallenyans,Pallena borne auncyently out of the countrey of Peloponese, and that theire auncestres

Brasidas, than vnderstandynge their rebellion, wente towardes them by nyghte, and causedde to goo a lytle before hym a galley for to discouer: and he hymself was in a brygantine, to the intent that if he encountred a greater and more puissante than hys, the galley myght succour him. And if he encountredde one galley, as puissante, as the same, that wente bifore he recōned that it wolde rathere matche itsel
                     •
                  e wyth the sayd galley, and by that meane, in the meane tyme, as the twoo galleys did fight togiders, he might saue hymself. So he arryued in this maner wythout any encoūtring at Scione. And

there assembled the people. And dyd speake vnto them in the selfsame forme and substance, as he had spoken to them of Acanthe and of Torone. And he praysed them somuche the more than the other: that albeit the Athenians dyd than occupie the citte of Pallene, whiche was situated at the distreate of Peloponese, and that they did holde the citie of Potydee: and that the same Scionians were all of the self Islande: yet neuerthelas they had the harte to be restoared to lybertie and out of the saruytude of the Athenians, of themselues. without 
                     •
                  arying vntyll necessitie shulde cause them to knowe and prouyde for their comon wealth. For the which hardynes and magnanymytie, he iudged them to be people, for to beare and endure valiantly and vertuously any other great affaire, if it happenned vnto them. And also he toke it welle, that they shulde be alwayes good and faythfull frendes of the Lacedemonians. And by that meane shuld be in all thinges praysed and honored by them. Through whiche woordes & declarations, the Scyonians dyd conceyue and take greate courage: in suche sorte, that they all with one accorde (aswell those, that toke the matter to be euil at the beginnyng, as also the other) determined to susteigne warre agaynste the Athenians, if the case chaunced. And aboue manye honors whiche they dyd to Brasidas, they sette a crowne of golde vpon his hedde: as to the deliuerer of Grece, and as to a man priuately theyr frende and well doer: they dyd geue hym a Chapelette or small garlande of vigne, and went to visett hym in his lodging, as was vsed to them, that had had the victorye of a battaille. But he arested not longe there, but hauing left with thē a small garnisone, he retourned thither, from whence he came. And sonne after, he retourned thider with a greate armye. To thintent to assaye, if he myght with their ayde, gett Mēde and Potydee, bifore the Athenians shuld come to their succours, as he doubted, that they would do. But hauyng already made the treatie with certayne of the sayd townes, bifore that he executed it, there came vnto hym out of a galley Aristonymus.Aristonymus. from the partie of the Athenians. And Atheneus from the partie of the Lacedemonians, who notefyed vnto hym the trefues. By occasion whereof, Brasidas retourned fromethence to Torone. At which place the sayd Ambassadours declared vnto hym more amply the tenour of the tratie. Whiche was approued and receyued by all the allyes, that were in Thrace, aswell on the one partie, as of the other. But Aristonimus, though that he approued all the sayd treatie, yet he sayd, that the Scyonyans were not therein comprised, forsomuche, as they rebelled after the date of the trefues. Whereunto Brasidas did replye, and maignteigned that they rebelled bifore. And for effect sayd, that he would not rendre them, so that the matter or thyng remayned, as broken. And after that Aristonymus hadde reaported that same at Athens, al the Athenians were of opiniō to begyn warre against the sayd Scyonians and dyd prepare themself, for to make it. Whiche thing being come to the knowlage of the Lacedemonians, they sent vnto thē ambassade, shewyng them, that they went agaynst the treatie. And that wrongfully they would recouer the sayd ctie of Scyone. vpon the reasons that Brasidas did shewe, and that if they would go thider by force, those Lacedemonians and their allyes would defende the sayd Scionians. But if they would that the matter were putt and referred to knowliage and into iudgemente, they were there with well contented. whereunto the Athenians made answere, that they would not putt their estate in hazarte of iudgemente, but were determyned to go agaynst the sayd Scyonyens, as fast as they coulde, thinking and holding it for certaine, that if they of the Islandes would rebelle, the succours of the Peloponesians by lande, coulde in nothyng sarue them. And for trouthe the Athenians had good quarelle, as touchyng

that. For it was certaynly founde that the rebellion of the Scioniens was two dayes after the conclusion of the treatie. This was the decree, of the greater parte and opinion of the Athenians made, in followyng thaduys of Cleon, that men shoulde go to take Scyone, and slaye all the Citizens. And therevnto they prepared themself. But in the meane tyme the cytie of Mende rebelled lykewyse,Menda. whiche is in the countrey of Pallene, inhabited and founded by the Ericrians. Whiche Brasidas receyued lykewyse, perswadyng hymself to do nothynge agaynste reasone, though that it was done duryng the trefues, forsomuche as the Athenians dyd lykewyse the contrarye. Whiche was the reasone, whereby those of Mende hadde takene boldenes for to rebelle, knowynge the wylle and deliberacion of Brasidas, and also seinge the experyence of the Scionians, whome he would not forsake. And also considering that though that they: that hadde brought to passe the treatie of the rebellion were in small nomber, and had greate feare to execute it: yet they lefte not to essaye it, and fearyng to be discouered, had wonne the other, that were the greater partie, albeit that it was contrarye to theyr expectacion. The Athenians, beinge aduertised of this rebellion, were yet more prouoked and stirred, and prepared themself for to go to destroy the sayed two rebelled cyties. But in the meane tyme, that they made their preparacions and afore that they aryued, Brasidas hadde withdrawen the women and childrene out of the same two cyties. And hadde caused them to be caryed into the countrey of Chalcyde.

               Howe Brasidas and Perdiccas hauing takene certene landes from Archibeus, vnderstandyng, that the Illyrians came to ouercome them, departed secretely. And howe Brasidas being forsaken by the sayd Perdiccas and his bende, saued hymself from the Illyriens, and howe Perdiccas and Brasidas became ennemyes. ☞The .xvii. Chapter.
               THis tyme enduryng, Brasidas and Perdiccas went agaynst Archibebeus into Lynceste,Linceste to wytt, Perdiccas with a good bende of Macedoniās and of other Grekes, inhabityng the sayd countrey: and Brasidas with the rest of the Peloponesiās, that he had, & with some Chalcydians, Achanthians and other of the confederated cyties, so that there were footemen in al, about three thousande, and horsemen, aswell Macedonians, as Chalcydians, aboutes a thousande, besydes a great nomber of straungers, that did followe them. Being than entred into the countrey of Archibeus, and vnderstandyng that the Lyncestians were imparked and incamped in the fielde, they also did the like, and planted their campe directly against the other, aither of thē vpon an hil, to wytt, the footemen on high: and the horsemē alowe, which horsemen anone came to elkarmusche in the playne that was bitwene the two hilles. And it was not longe, tyll that Brasidas and Perdiccas caused their footemen to discende frome the hille. And firste came to ioigne themself with their horesemen readye to fyght. Whiche parceyuynge the Lyncestians, they dyd the

                   so that they came to battaille. But those Lnycestians were sone repoulsed, and put to flyght. Wherein there was a greate nomber of them 
                     •
                  layne. The other retyred into the mountaigne. And that done, Brasidas and Perdiccas, hauyng there reysed vp their Trophe in signe of victorye, they kept the felde two or .iii. dayes, attendyng the Illyrians. Whome the sayd Perdiccas had soulded and waged for to come to his succours. After that terme passed, Perdiccas wold that they shoulde haue marched further into the countrey: and that they shoulde haue takenne the townes of Archibeus, But Brasidas, who feared leste the armye of the Athenians shoulde come in the meane season: and destroye those of Mende, seyng also that the Illynans came not, he was of opinion to retourne backe. And they, being in this difference, hadde newes howe that the Illyrians, whiche had takene wages of the sayd Perdiccas, had deceyued hym, and were gone to the saruyce of Archibeus. By occasiō whereof fearyng the comyng of the Illyrians: who are warlyke people, they were both of opyniō to retourne backe. But they agrede not of the waye that they shulde kepe, so that they departed in the euening pryuely, without conclusion. And Perdiccas retyred fromthence into his campe, whiche was a lytle distante from the same of Brasidas. And the nyght folowyng, the Macedoniens and the estrangers in Perdiccas campe, for the feare that they had of the commyng of the sayd Illyrians: for that, that the bruyte was greater, than the matter requyred, 
                     •
                  lyke as it oftentymes chaūceth, in great Armyes) they departed out of the campe without lycēce. And retourned into their houses. And though that Perdiccas at the begynnyng knewe nothing of their deliberacion: yet after that they hadde concluded it they came to hym, and forced him to departe fromethence with them. Without that, that he might speake wyth Brasidas, whiche had his campe lodged farre ynoughe from hym. Who vnderstandyng at the breake of the daye: the departure of the Macedonians, & the commyng of the Illyrians and of Archibeus, he ordeyned his armye in a quadrant battaille, & enclosed the foote men lyghtly armed within the myddelmost, and afterwardes caused them to marche, to thintent also to haue wythdrawen himself. And he with three houndred of the yongest and of the most galliarde, taryed behynde, for to susteigne the chocke and charge of the currours, and of those, that shulde come to sett vpon hym, for to enterteigne and slacke or kepe backe the first, vntill the other marched more forewarde, & determyned to retyre and withdrawe hymself last of all. But byfore the commyng of th
                     •
                  nnemyes, he did speake vnto his men of warre at fewe wordes, in māner followyng.
               
                  The exhortation of Brasidas vnto his mē of warre.
                  IF I dyd not suspecte (Lordes Peloponesians) that ye were astonyed of this, that our frendes haue habandonned vs, and that the strā
                     gers, in right great nomber, do come for to ouercome vs: I woulde not enterprise to exhorte you, nother would I teache you, howe to vse your self, as nowe I do. But forsomuche as it semeth to me, that for theis two causes, whiche be ryght great ye be somewhat abashed: I wyll speake vnto you by manner of declaracion and exhortyng, what I thynke herein. That is, that it is conuenient for you to be valyant and hardy in the warre, not trustyng alwayes in the ayde of your frendes, and allyes, but in your oune vertue: and also not to be abashed nor feare the multitude of your ennemyes. For ye are borne in a citie
                        •
                      wherein a small nomber of people doeth gouerne a greate nomber, and not the greater nomber, the lesse. The whiche auctoritie and puissance they haue acquired by many victories, whiche they haue hadde in battaille. And as touching

the estrangers, of whome ye presently be afrayde, for that, that ye haue not proued them, ye maye well knowe that they be not very sharpe or cruel, aswell by those, agaynste whome, ye haue foughte for the Macedonians, as also by that, that I haue learned by common reaporte, and that I conceyue of them by coniecture. Nowe it is so, that those, that thynke the people, agaynste whome, they haue to do, to be more strong and better warryours than that they ar
                        •
                     e, whan they haue knowen the trouthe by experience, they afterwarde gooe more boldely agaynste them. And lykewyse if there be any vertue in the ennemyes, whereof we be not aduertised: lette vs assaille them the more assuredlye. Wherefore as touchyng thies here, that come agaynste vs, they bee to be feared of people, that knowe them not: for the greate nomber that they be of, whiche ys fearefull to beholde, and also horrible to here: for the greate bruyte, that they make, aswell by cryinge, as also by shakynge and clatterynge of their harnesse. Whiche be all but only menaces and threatenynges. But whan they come to fyght agaynste the people, that be not thereof abasshed, they shewe themself not to be suche. For they be not ashamed to recuyle and to habandone their place, whan they be straightly charged vpon. For that, that they kepe no order. And by this cause it is asmuche honoure for them to flye, as to assaulte. Wherefore no man canne iudge their hardines. For where it is in the lybertie of any one for to fight or for to exchue fyghtynge: trulye he maye alwayes fynde some good excuse for to saue hymself. And euen so, thies beinge of this sorte, shall fynde it muche more sure and easye for vs, to feare vs a farre of by their cryes and greate menacynges, withoute puttynge themself in daunger: than for to come nighe for to fyght wyth vs. And yf it were otherwyse, they woulde rather come to the fyghtynge, than to make all thies crakes. And for conclusion ye see all the feare that is to be hadde of them. Whiche is greate to syghte, and to the hearynge: but in battaille it is very smalle. Wherefore yf ye susteigne and withstande theyr power, whan they come to charge vpon you, and afterwardes doo retyre by lytle and lytle in good order, youe shall ryghte shortely comme in faulftie into a sure place. And shall knowe for the tyme to comme, that the nature and manner of this people: is to make a farre of, very great craakes and menaces, and to shewe great hardines to them, that they do parceyue to be ready to receyue them: and to retourne and shewe themself astonyed, whan men ioigne nere vnto them, and that they wolle fyght hande to hande. For in this case, they shewe their valyantnes, in sauyng and kepyng themself in suertie. After that Brasidas hadde thus exhorted and anymated his people, he caused them to marche in battaille, retyryng and withdrawyng hymself by lytle and lytle. Whiche parceyued by the strangers, they followed them with all diligence, makyng greate cryes and greate bruyte accordynge to thier custome, thynkynge that they shoulde haue fledde, and by that meane to haue cutte of theyr waye, and destroyedde them. But whan they dydde perceyue that the Grekes dydde manfullye resiste the auante courrers, whiche aboorded them in some partes: and that Brasidas, wyth the bende whiche he hadde chosene, endured and dydde susteigne all the puissance and strengthe of the other, whcihe came for to charge vpon them: they were all astonyed. And the Grekes hauynge withstanded the firste charge, dydde afterwardes more easely repoulse the other. And yet neuerthelesse after that the straungers ceassed to assaille theym, they retyred by lytle and lytle towardes the mountaigne, in suche wyse, that whan Brasidas and they that were with hym, were come into

a large and spacious playne, the bende of the strangers, that were ordeyned for to pursue them, kepte themself a farre of. And as touchyng the other, they followed and chased the rest of the Grekes, whiche fled. And those, that they dyd take out of the trowpe were slayne without mercye. And seing that Brasidas coulde not saue hymself but by an straicte passage, whiche was at the entryng of the lande of Archibe

                     self in the entryng, thynkyng to haue stayed hym there, and to haue taken hym. But he parceyuyng their enterprise, cōmaunded three houndred men, that were with hym that they shulde with the moste diligence that they coulde without kepyng any order, ronne to one of the sayd rockes, to the same, that semed vnto them most dangerous, & do their best for to wynne it, bifore that the ennemyes shulde assemble themself there togiders in a greater nomber. Whiche thyng they did so vertuously, valiantly and so readely: that at the aryuall, they chased the ennemyes fromthence, whiche nowe already had gotten the height and toppe of it. By meane whereof, the other Grekes came easely to gett the passage. For the estraungers, seing their people flying awaye: whiche were de

                     ected and dryuen downe from the sayd rocke, and also that the Grekes had already gottone the passage for to saue themself: they folowed them no further. And by that meane Brasidas, keping the height of the mountaignes for to passe in more suertie, arryued that same daye in the towne of Armissa.Armissa Whiche was in the obeyssance of Perdiccas. At whiche place being arryued, the souldiars of Brasidas, for despyte and anger that they hadde, for that, that the Macedonians were the firste, that brake of, and went their waye and had habandoned and forsaken them: as they founde their Oxen yoaked or their other baguages that they had left in the way (lyke as it is to be bileued that men do, whan they flye, speciallye in the nyght) they vnyoacked the Oxen and toke of their baguages. that, which pleased them. Whereby Perdiccas parceyued first that Brasidas was his ennemy. Throughe occasion whereof, he changed fromthensforwardes the affeccion that he had towardes the Peloponesians. And yet neuerthelas dyd not fourthwi

               Howe the citie of Menda was taken by the Athenians, and that same of Scyona assieged. And certen other thynges that happened aboute the ende of the yeare. ☞The .xviii. Chapter.
               WHan Brasidas was retourned to Torona, he founde that the Athenians had recouered and taken Menda agayne. Whereupon consideryng that he was not puissante ynough for to defende Pallena, if he had gone thider: he taryed at the sayd place of Torona, for to defēde it. For in the meane tyme, that he had bene with Perdiccas, the Athenians issued for to come to the ayde of the Lyncesters, agaynst Menda and agaynst Sciona with fiftie shyppes well apparailled. Whereof there was tenne of Chio, carying a thousande men well armed. Of their countrey sixe houndred Archers being Thraciens. And a thousande other estrangers, togiders with a certen nomber of footemen, light armed: whereof were Capitains, Nicyas,Nycias. the sonne of Nyceratus, and Nycostratus,Nicostratus. sonne of Dyotrephus Who being departed from Potydea with the sayd armye, whan they were foranempste the temple of Neptunus,

they wente directly agaynste Menda. But those of the cytie, parceyuynge them commynge, and hauyng three houndred men of Scyona with the garnisone of Peloponesians for their ayde: yssued fourth of the cytie all in armure, to the nomber of seuen houndred in all, vnder the conducte of Polydamydas.Polydamydas. And camped themself vpon a lytle mountaigne which semed vnto them to be a place very sure. And though that Nycyas, with sixe skoore men of Methone and three skoore of the moste gentle compaignions Athenians with all the archers dydde their beste to deiecte and remoue them frome the sayd place, thynkyng to mount by certayne pathwayes of the sayed mountaigne: yet he was so oppressed with shotte, that he was cons
                     •
                  rayned to retyre. And Nicostratus, that woulde haue mounted by an other syde with the rest of the armye, was so sturdely repoulsed, that it fayled very lytle, but that all the army of the Athenians had bene put out of order and destroyed that same day. Whereupon parceyuyng that they coulde not haue the better agaynst the Mendyans they retyred into their campe bifore the towne, & the Mendyans in the night time withdrewe themself into yt. The morowe folowynge, the Athenyans wente to ouercomme the lande of Sciona: and pyllaged all the villages, all the houses, and all the feldes, rounde aboute the towne so longe, as the daye endured, wythoute that those, that were wythin durst yssue fourth, forsomuche as there was certaine dissention emongest them. The night followyng, the three houndred Scyonyans, that were within Menda retourned into their houses. And the day being come, Nycyas, with the moytie of the armye: went afreshe to ouercome the lande of the sayd Scionyans. And Nycostratus with the rest came for to lodge himself bifore the gates of ye towne on the highest syde, whiche is leadyng towardes Potidea. On the other syde Polydamydas, who was within & had the defence of that same quarter with the cytizeins and a nomber of estrangers being Peloponesians, anymated & encouraged his people and did putt them in battaille, for to yssue fourth agaynst the Athenians. But there was one of the towne that dyd speake agaynst hym, saying that it was not mete nor conuenient for to yssue fourth nother to fyght. Wherewith he was so angry that he rushed vpon him and rudely vsed him. Which sene, they of the towne, coulde not endure hym. But dyd take all armure for to charge vpon the Peloponesians and them that were with them. Who, seyng the furye, dyd flye, aswell for feare of the people of the towne, as also of the Athenians (vnto whome, in thies enterchances, the gates were opened,) doubtynge that it had bene arra

                  ne conspired agaynst them. And they that might, withdrewe themself into the castell, whereof they were seased in tymes passed. In the meane tyme, the Athenians entred into the towne (for Nycias was alreadye retourned for to ouercome it) and they did pyllage it vtterly. Thynkynge that the gates were not opened vnto them, nother by traictie nor by generall deliberation, but aither by fortune or els by particuler intelligēce. And although the capytains had inough to do for to defende, that they shulde not kylle all those, that were within, yet neuerthelas the bruyte being appeased, the self capytaines cōmaunded the citizeins, that they shulde take againe the gouernāce of the towne, lyke as in times passed, th

And afterwardes they enclosed thē, that were within the castell with walles that extended vnto the sea on al sydes, and therein did put gardes & souldiars. And afterwardes departed fromethence with the rest of tharmy against Scyone. Against whome, they of ye towne issued fourth bifore their coming, with the Peloponesians, whiche they had, and lodged themself vpon a lytle hille, whiche was verye nighe vnto the walle, for that, that

without takynge of it, men coulde not welle assiege the towne. But the Athenyans dydde assaille theym so lyuely, that they dislodged them. And by that meane, hauynge reysed vp their Trophe there in signe of victorye: they layde siege vnto the towne
                     •
                   and determyned to enclose it on al sydes. But they being occupyed in that worke, the Peloponesyans

                   that were within the castell of Menda yssued fourth by nyght. And in despite of them that helde them assieged: they passed by the sea coaste, and the more parte came through the campe of the Athenyans so that they entredde into Scyone. In thies enterfaictes

And for that, that Nycias requyred him, that in declaring himself that he would do some good saruice for the Athenians, and also for his owne comoditie he would well empesche that the Peloponesians should no more entre into his lande, he denyed passaige vnto Isthagoras Lacedemonyan,Isthagoras. who conducted the army by lande of the sayd Peloponesians for to ioigne himself with Brasidas, and furthermore defended hym, that he shoulde not take into hys saruice, any of the Thessalyens. But that notwithstanding, that same Isthagoras and Amnenias & Arysteus with hym,

And though that it was defēded by thordenāces of the towne, that they, which had charge of any place: shulde no cōmytt it to any other whatsoeuer parsone: yet neuerthelas, they appoyncted Clearidas,Clearidas. sonne of Cleonymus to the kepynge of Amphipolis, and to Torona Tellidas,Telidas. the sonne of Hegesander. The same somer, the Thebayns bett downe the walles of the Thespians, chargyng them that they hadde confederacion wyth the Athenyans, whiche thynge they were mynded in tymes passedde to haue done. But than yt was more easye for them, for that, that in the battaille, whiche they hadde had agaynst the Athenyans, the more parte of their yonge people were slayne. Also in that same somer, the tēple of Iuno, whiche was at Argos, was burned through faulte of Chrysis,Chrysis. that was than Abb

By reasone whereof, fearynge that the Argiues would do her some displaisir: in the night time, she fledde fromethence into Philontus. Whereupon the Argiues accordyng to their lawes and ordenances did depose her, and in her place didde put one Phenides,Phayus notwithstandynge that the sayed Chrysis hadde bene there presidente eighte yeares and an halfe

Aboutes the ende of somer, the Athenyans hauynge enuironedde Scyona wyth a walle on all sydes, they dyd putte within yt good garnysonnes, and after retournedde vnto Athens. The wynter followynge, was peasable bitwene the Athenyans and the Peloponesians, by meane of the trefues. But the Mantynyens and the Tegetes, hadde battaylle togiders, ayther hauynge the ayde of hys allyes, nigh vnto Laodicum whiche is in the lande of Oristide,Laodicum. of the whiche battaylle the victorye was vncertayne. For the ryghte poyncte or wynge of ayther partie was brokene and putte to flyght. By occasion whereof, aither of the sayd parties reysed and sette vp their Trophe in tokene of victory, and fromthence dyd sende their spoylles, that they hadde gotten of thennemyes, to be offered at the temple of Delphos. For there was also many deade, aswelle on the one parte, as of the other. And bifore, that yt myght be parceyued who hadde the victorye or better, the nyght departedde theym. Neuerthelas the

Tegetes kepte the campe all that same nyght and dyd sette vp (euen at the same houre) their trophe vpon that self place. And the Mantynyans retyred into Bucolion.Bucolion. And within a certaine tyme after, dyd

Hauyng some intelligence and confederaciō of some that were wythin. And he came by nyght vnto the walle, and raysed vp his ladders for to mount, bifore that they of the towne parceyued it. For he had espyeall there that whan the watche was changed, he that hadde the kepynge of that same quarter of the walle remoued to go to an other place. Whiche thinge Brasidas vnderstoode by the sowne of a lytle belle, which he of the watche dyd ringe departyng frome hys place, and caryed it into the other quarter. Wherby whilest he was in remouyng: and bifore that he was come agayne into hys place, the ladders were reysed vp. But as Brasidas woulde haue mounted, the matter was perceyued. Whereby he was constrayned to retyre that selfe nyght with his armye. Thus endeth the wynter of that same yeare, whiche was the nyneth of the warre, that Thucydides hathe wryttone.

               THE somer followyng ended the firste yeare of the trefues, to wytte, the daye of the feaste of Pythie. Durynge whiche tyme, the Athenyans chased oute of the Isle of Delos, those, that therein inhabyted, for that, that they thought, for some auncient consideracion, that they were not good lyuers. And that there rested, but onely that, for

And they, that were dryuene fromethence: repaired into the towne Atramyteum,Atramittū. in the countrey of Asie, to whome Pharmaces dyd geue place for to inhabitte,Pharnaces. as they came thider. After that the trefues was ended, Cleon went wyth thyrty shyppes into Thrace. Hauynge in the same shyppes, twelue houndredde footemenne all well armed, beinge all Athenyans, and three houndred horsemen with a greate nomber of allyes

whiche was yet besieged, he dydde take a certene nomber of the garnisone which was at the siege, and wente therewith to the porte of Colophonians, which was not farre distante frome the cytie of Torone. And vnderstandynge by certayne fugityues, that Brasidas was not there, and that those, that he hadde left there, coulde not resiste hys puislance: he descendedde frome the shyppes and came by lande agaynste the cytie, hauynge lefte twentye of hys shyppes, for to enuirone and enclose the porte. And he wente directly agaynste the newe wal

                  les and rampars that Brasidas hadde made, for to enclose the suburbes wythin the towne. And to the intente that it shoulde haue bene all one forte, he dydde beate downe the olde walles that deuydedde the towne frome the suburbs.

Beinge at whiche place, he commaunded Perdiccas, that insuyng the allyance, whiche he had lately made wyth the Athenians, he shulde come vnto hym with his puissance. And the lyke he also commanded in Thrace vnto Polles kynge of Odomantins, who than hadde a greate bende of Thracians to his souldeours, whose commyng Cleon attended

at the sayd place of Eione. Whiche thyng beyng come to the knowlaige of Brasidas, he with hys armye dydde come for to lodge nygh vnto Cerdyliū.Cerdiliū
                   Whiche is an hyghe and stronge place in the countrey of Argilians on the other syde of the Ryuer verye nyghe Amphipolis. Oute frome whiche place all thynges that hys ennemyes dydde, myght easelye bene sene: lyke as they also myght see hym. Cleon (euene as Brasidas thoughte) marched wyth hys armye agaynste Amphipolis, not passynge annye thynge of Brasidas, who hadde but a thousande fyue houndredde Thracyans, huyred souldyars, togiders wyth the Edoniens all well armedde, and a certene nomber of horsemenne, aswell Myrcyniens as Chalcydians, besydes the thousande that he hadde sente into Amphipolis, and they myght be in all two thousande footemen and three houndredde horsemen, of the whiche he dydde take a thousande fyue houndred and mounted to Cerdyliū, and he sent the other into Amphipolis to the succours of Clearydas. As touchynge Cleon, he kepte hymselfe stylle withoute enterprisyng any thynge, vntyll that he was constrayned by the meane of that whiche Brasidas thought would happene, that is, that hys people shulde be displeased to tary there wythout faightynge, and reputed Cleon to be slacke and of small knowlaige of warre, in comparisonne of Brasidas, whome they estemed to be an hardye man and a good Capatayne. And somuche the more, for that that they were vnwyllynglye comme wyth hym and agaynste their wylles. Whereupon Cleon, vnderstandynge their murmuratiō and to thintent that they shuld be no further displeased to be there: he ledde them frome the same place wherein they were, all in battaylle raye, in the self order that he vsed at Pylus, trusting that he should spede wel. For he also thoughte that the ennemyes durste not comme for to fyght agaynste hym. But he sayedde that he descendedde with hys campe onely for to see the place and yet neuerthelas he attendedde a greate strengthe, not somuche for hope of vaynquishynge, in case he were constraynedde to fyghte, as for to enuyrone the cytie and to assaille yt. Beynge than come wyth his armye whiche was fayer and puissant verye nyghe to Amphipolis, he lodgedde hymselfe vpon the toppe of an hylle, fromewhence he myght see the countrey rounde aboute. And so marked veray diligently the Scyte of the cytie, chiefly frome the coste of Thracie, howe the ryue

And on the other syde, he dyd see no man within the cytie, nother those that entred nother that yssued or came fourthe of the gates. Whiche were all lockedde and shutte in. Wherefore he repentedde hymselfe veray soare, and thoughte that he hadde commytted a greate faulte: for that, that he hadde not brought his Engines of artillery for to battre the towne. For he coniectured that yf he hadde hadde theym there, he myght easely haue takene it. Whan Brasidas vnderstoode that the Athenyans were dislodgedde, he lykewyse dislodgedde frome Cerdylium and entred with all hys bende into Amphipolis. Without makynge any semblante for to be wyllynge ayther to yssue fourthe or for to fyghte agaynste the Athenyans, for that, that he reputedde hymselfe not puissante for to do it. Not onelye somuche for the nomber of people, whereof he hadde welle nygh as many as they: but also for the preparacion and for the sorte of the people. For in the armye of the Athenyans, there was al the force of the Lemnyans and of the Imbryans. Wherefore he determyned for to putte in vre a cautell

But afore the executyng of his enterpryse, he mynded for to declare it well vnto his souldiars, and also for to exhorte them manfully to doo and followe it.

                  The narration of Brasidas vnto his souldiars.

To thintente that considerynge that I am wyllyng to approue and essay fortune with a small nomber of people, without takyng all our puyssance: ye shall not thereof be astonyed, fearynge to be the weaker. For I coniecture that oure ennemye, who despyseth vs, thynkynge that we dare not enterpryse to come to fyght agaynst hym, ys amounted in that high place onely for to see the countrey: and kepeth hymself withoute any order as is all thynges assured. And it happeneth oftentymes, that he, which diligently marketh therrour and faulte of his ennemye, and determyneth manfully for to assaille hym, not in ranked battaille nother in an appoyncted iourney: but so as he parceyueth his aduantage, cometh to the effecte of his enterprise bothe to his honour and proffitt. For also those secrett and soubdayne eskermouches that be made in warre, whereby specially a man deceiueth his ennemyes and doeth seruice and succour to hys frendes, do geue and attribute greate glory vnto the enterprisers. Wherefore in the meane tyme that they be thus in disorder and that they be in doubte of nothyng, and bifore that they dissodge themself fromthence (whiche thing I thinke that they be willing to do

And in doubt what they may do, bifore that they be resolued amonge themself, and for to enter if I may: into the myddel of their army. And thou Clearidas, whan thou shalt see that I shalbe amōg them, and that thou parceyuest that they be astonyed and afrayed, opnene thou the gates of the towne, and yssue fourth soubdainely on the other syde, wyth the nomber of people, that thou shalt than haue, aswell of the towne as estrangers, and come with the moste diligence that thou mayste, to the reskue, for to rushe and passe throughe them. For I do thynke that in this doynge they shall be putt in greate feare. Forsomuche as they which come sodainely afreshe vnto a conflict, cause alwayes more drede and feare, than they which be in battaile afore. Wherfore for thy parte

Capytaynes. And that if this presente daye ye shewe youre selfe as valiante men, ye shalle acquyre and gette lybertie, and shalle be frome hencefourthewarde called compaignyons and allyes of the Lacedemonians. And that doinge otherwyse, thoughe youe maye eskape, to be all slayne, and youre towne destroyed. or at the beste that maye happene, ye shall be in moore greuous seruytude than hitherto ye haue bene. And also shalbe cause for to lette, that the other Grekes shall not recouer their lybertie.

Brasidas hauynge thus anymated hys people, he putteth them in order for to issue fourth wyth hym, and lykewyse those, that shulde comme afterwardes wyth Clearidas out of the gate of Thrace, as is bifore saide.

Whyche thynge might easely be knowen aswell for that that it myght clerely and playnly be sene that they that were wythin the towne, did arme themself, as also for that, that a man myght see at the yssuinge of the gates the marchinges and the traicte of the people and of horses that issued fourth. wherof ye same Cleon was greatly astonied, and soubdaynely descended from the place wherin he was, for to see, if it were so. And after that he had knowin that it was the verytie, hauynge already determined not to fyght vntill hys succours, whyche he attended and loked for, shulde haue bene arryued: and consyderynge that if he dydde retyre by the coste that he had marked and deuysed, he shulde tomuche clerely bene sene, he caused a

But seynge that those of the sayd lefte poynct dyd marche to slackly, he caused them of the ryght poyncte wherein he was, to tourne into that parte, and there he himself wente, leauynge by that meane the myddell of the battaille nakedde and discouered, makynge the mooste dylygence that he myght for to retyre. Durynge thys tyme Brasydas knowynge that it was tyme to marche, parceyuinge specyally the enemys to wauer, he sayd vnto them that were wyth hym, and lykewise vnto the other, thies people woll not tary, for ye see howe their speares and their heddes remoue to and frome, and neuer people dyd that, whyche were wylling to fyght, Therfore open the gates, and let vs wyth greate couraige charge vpon them wyth the moste diligence that we may. And fourthwyth the gates were opened in that quarter, that he had appoyncted, aswell those same of the towne as the same of the rampare and of the longe walle, and yssued wyth hys people in a greate course, kepyng the straight way, where a man may presently see the Trophee in token of victorye raysed vp. And so he rushed into the middell of the battayle of the ennemys, whyche he founde hooly astonyed for the disorder and sore afrayed for the hardynes of their ennemyes. In suche sorte, that he dyd putt thē incontynently to flyght. And sone after, Clearydas yssued fourthe by the gate of Thrace, lyke as he had bene appoyncted, who rushed in on the other

                      wherof the Athenyans parceyuinge themselfe so soubdaynely and contrary to their expectacyon assayled on all partes, were yet more afraied, insomuch that they that

were in the lefte poyncte, who had takene the waye of Eione, dydde flye wyhoute annye order. In thys meane tyme Brasydas charginge vpon the ryghte poinct, was soore hurte, so that he dydde fall to the earthe, but byfore that the Athenyans dydde parceyue yt, he was releuedde by his men that were aboute him. And yett neuerthelas the ryghte poyncte of the sayde Athenyans kepte it selfe most fyrme. But whan Cleon dydde parceyue, that it was noo tyme to tarye annye longer, he fledde, and so was encountredde by a footeman of the ennemyes Myrciniens, who dydde slaye hym. And yet neuerthelas those that were wythe hym stode in their defence agaynst Clearydas at the mountyng of the hyll, and there they dyd fyghte valiantly, vntill that the horsemen and fotemen lightly armed, aswel Marcynians as Chalcydes came vpō thē, who wyth stroakes of

And by that meane all the hooste of the Athenyans was brokenne, and fledde awaye some one waye and the other on the other syde: euery one the beste that he coulde towardes the mountaignes. And they that coulde eskape retyred to Eiona. After that Brasidas was brought agayne into the cytie, bifore that he rendredde the sprytte, he knewe that he had had the victorye and lyued not longe after. As touchyng Clearydas he pursued the enemyes as farre as he could wyth the rest of the souldiars. After he came agayne into the place of the battaille, and whan they hadde spoylledde the deade, they sette vppe their Trophee in the same place in tokenne of vyctorye. And that done they all accompaygnyedde the bodye of Brasidas wyth the habillementes and othere furnyture and buryedde yt wythin the cytie bifore the markett place, whyche at thys presente is there. In whyche place, the Amphipolit

And decrede & ordeyned sacrifices vnto hym as sayncts had: wt tourneys and yearely honnors. And also they attrybuted vnto hym the tytle, to haue founded and peopled the cytie. And all thynge that was founde by wrytynge or by payntinge and grauynge, makynge memorye of Agnon, who hadde bene their founder, they toke awaye and defaced, reputynge Brasidas to be their delyuerer. And they dydde the rather thys thynge for to please the Lacedemonyans, for feare that they had afterwardes of the Athenyans. For they also thought yt moore their proffitt and their honnour for to exhybitte those honnours vnto Brasidas, than vnto Agnon, for the enmytie that they hadde agaynste the Athenyans. Unto whom neuerthelas they dydde render their deade corpses. whyche were founde aboutes sixe houndredde. where of the othere were founde, but seuenne. By meane that thys was not properly a battaylle, but a soubdayne onsett, wherein there was no greate reesistence. Aftere that the corpses were rendredde, the Athenyans retournedde by sea vnto Athenes and Clearydas wythe hys people abodde in the Cytie for to geue order in the gouernemente thereof. Thys ouerthrowe happened aboute the ende of Sommer. In whyche selfe tyme Ramphias and Authocaridas Lacedemonyans conductedde by sea nyne houndred men of warre into the countrey of Thrace,

               How the Lacedemonians made peace for themselfe and theire allyes and afterwardes howe they made allyance amonge themself wythoute the othere. ☞The .iii. Chaptre.
               IN the begynnynge of wynter those, that were wyth Ramphias passedde furthere vnto the mounte Pierie, whiche is in Thessale. But they of the countrey denyed them their passage. By occasion wherof & also hauynge vnderstande the death of Brasidas to whom that bend shulde haue bene brought, they retourned home. For they also thought, that yt was no tyme to renewe the warre, consideryng that the Athenyans were retourned and that they were not people for to parfaicte and acheue the enterpryses of Brasidas. And on the othere syde they dyd know that at their departure from Sparta, the Lacedemonyans were more enclynedde to peace, than vnto warre. And in effecte after the conflycte at Amphipolis and the retourne of Ramphias frome Thessale, there was no exploicte of warre bitwene the Athenyans and the Lacedemonyans, for both parties desired rather peace than warre. To wytt, the Athenyans by cause of the losse that they had had at Delos furst, and sone after at Amphipolis. By reasone wherof they estemed not their force, somuch as they did at the begynnyng whan it was spoken of the appoynctment, whych they refused, for that that they trusted tomuche in their prosperytie, and also greatelye feared leste their allyes seynge their case and chance to declyne and decaye, shuld reuolte and rebelle, and therfore repented thēself hartely that they dyd not make peace fourthwyth after the victorye, that they had at Pylus. On the othere syde the Lacedemonyans desyred yt, forsomuch as it chaūced otherwyse in the warre, than fro the begynninge they thought yt wolde haue done. For they dyd thinke that wastynge the terrytorye of the Athenyans, in short tyme they shulde haue destroyed them and brought them vnder. And also for the greate losse whyche they hadde made at Pylus. whyche was the greateste that they of Sparte had euer had. And somuche the more, for that that the ennemyes that were wythin Pylus and wythin Chitera ceased not to ouerronne and pillage their countrey there nexte adioygninge. And besydes that, their sklaues oftentymes rendredde themself to the sayd ennemyes, and also were contynuelly in feare, leste the other wolde do the lyke, by encouraigemente of those, that were gone fro them. There was also an other reasone, that is, that the trefues whyche the sayde Lacedemonyans had made for thirty yeares wyth the Argyues shulde shortely expyre, the whyche they were not mynded to contynue, excepte the sayd Argyues wolde render to them the lande of Cynuria.Cinuria And also they parceyued theymselfe not to be puissant inoughe for to make warre both agaynste the Athenyans and againste them, and somuche the moore for that they fearedde leste some of the cyties that dyd take their partie in the countrey of Peloponese, wold tourne from their side, lyke as afterwardes it happened. For thies respectes and reasons both the one & the other partie desyred to haue peace. And chiefly the Lacedemonyans for to recouer the prysonners whyche were taken in the Islande. who had ben the cause, wherfore (euen from the begynnynge that they were taken) the said Lacedemonyans procured and laboured the peace. But the Athenyans beynge pufte vp & sett in pryde wyth their prosperytie, wolde in no wyse heare thereof, hopynge to do greater thynges, afore the warre shulde be ended. But after yt they were ouerthrowin at Delos, the Lacedemonyans, thynkynge that at the selfe houre, they

wold haue bene more tractable, accorded the trefues of one yeare. mindding, duringe that same, to intreate the peace orelles a longer trefues. And aftere that, happenedde the ouerethrowe of Amphipolis, whyche helpedde welle to the peace. And somuche moore that Brasidas and Cleon were therein slayne
                     •
                   who were the pryncipall and chiefe that empeschedde the peace on boeth sydes. To wytte, Brasidas for that, that he hadde goode fortune in warre, whereby he hopedde the encrease of honnoure. And Cleone for that, that he thoughte that hys faultes and offences shulde bee moore manyfeste in tyme of peace, than in tyme of warre, and thatt men woolde nott geue somuche faythe vnto hys inuentions and euylle opynyons, if yt were peace. Whereupon thoose twoo beyng faylledde, remaynedde the twoo pryncypall men of twoo Cyties, whereof aythere of theyme greatelye desyredde peace, hopynge by meane thereof for to obteigne the pryncipalytie in the sayde Cyties. To wytte, Plistoanax sonne of Pausanias kynge of Lacedemonye,Plistoan

                     x. and Nycias sonne of Niceratus Athenian,Nycias. whyche was the beste Capytayne that they for that tyme hadde for the warre, and the same that hadde done the beste feates. wherefore he thoughte yt beste for to make peace, in thys meane tyme, that the Athenyans were in good prosperytie, to the intente that he hadde noo cause of lose (by annye inconuenience) hys good fortune, and also that he hymselfe and the Cytezeins mighte be fromthence fourthe in reste and tranquillitie. And that he myghte leaue his good renomme aftere hym, that he neuer dydde nor counsailledde the thinge, whereby the Cytie coulde fynde him euille. whiche thynge mighte chaunce otherewise, yf causes were commyttedde to the aduenture of warre: the daungers whereof be eschuedde by the peace. And as touchynge Plistoanax he desyredde yt, for that, that he was suspectedde frome the begynnynge of the warre, that he retourned fromthence and hadde brought agayne the armye of the Peloponesyans out of the countreye and terrytorye of the Athenyans. By meane whereof all the dammages that were afterwardes happenedde to the Lacedemonyans, were imputedde vnto him. And furthermore he was chargedde that he and Aristoteles his brother hadde entysedde a dyuyneresse that was at Delphos,Aristocles. and pronouncedde the aunsweres of the god Apollo, so that shee in the name of that god and as inspyredde by hym, hadde answeredde vnto the Messengers whiche the Lacedemonyans hadde sente thider for to vnderstande and knowe the wylle and opynyon of the god touchinge the warre, in this manner and substance. The discente and lignage of Iupiter beinge halfe goddes, shulde brynge agayne theire generatyon, whyche is in an other lande, into their owne: orelles shulde laboure the lande wythe coultours of syluer. And thys didde he, forsomuche as hee was bannyshedde into Lycea, for the suspytion that was hadde of hym that he had takenne monney for to retourne oute of the countreye of Athenes, in whyche place of Lycea he taryedde a longe tyme. But by meane of the sayde aunswere of the god, he was calledde agayne and receyued into the Cytie wythe the honnours that were accustomably made vnto kynges at their entrynge. Nowe for to abolishe and take away thys infamy, he hartely desyred peace, for he thoughte that c

                  ssynge the inconuenyences of the warre, noo occasion shulde be hadde for to reproche nother to impute the sayde thynges vnto hym: specyallye the Cytezeins hauynge recoueredde theire prysonners. And that as longe as the warre enduredde, the murmuratyon shoulde alwayes contynue. For it was neuere otherewyse, but whanne the people doo parceyue the incommodytyes and aduersytyes of warre, they murmure alwayes agaynste the Prynces and Rulers.

So thys parlement and treatie of peace endured all the wynter. And whan yt came about the ende of wynter, the Lacedemonyans made semblant for to reyse vp a greate armie, and sente throughe all the confederatedde cyties for to warne thē that they shuld make their appare

And the Athenyans dydde saye the lyke of Platea.

                  or thys cause all the confederates beynge assembled by the Lacedemonyans for thys matter, they were contente that the peace shulde be concluded, and in makynge the same, that Platea shuld remaigne to the Thebains, and
Nisea to the Athenyans. Excepte the sayde Beotians, the Corynthians, the Elians and the Megarens, whyche were not content wyth thys peace. But that notwithstandynge, by comon decree, yt was concluded and sworne by the Ambassadours of the Athenyans at Sparta, and afterwardes confyrmed by the cō

Item if there bee annye thynge that ys not determynedde, whyche neuerthelas shalle afterwardes be founde reasonable for boethe partyes: that same maye be addedde by the Athenyans and Lacedemonyans. And thys appoynctemente was acceptedde at Sparte, whanne Plistolas dydde gouerne and was chiefe offycer of the towne, the .xxvi daye of the moneth Arthemesius.

But vnderstandinge that it was concorded and concludedde, he forthwith retourned to the sayed place of Amphipolis by the commandemente of the Lacedemonyans. Who commandedde him expressely that he should redelyuer the cytie to the Athenyans, or if the citizeins made any difficultie therein, that he shoulde comme fromethence withall the Peloponesians that were within it. As touchyng the other confederated cyties, their ambassadours being comme to the Lacedemonyans, they shewed them that the sayed appoynctement shoulde be pr

Neuerthelas after that the sayd Lacedemonyans hadde hearde them, they woulde not in any poyncte change that whiche they hadde done. But sente them awaye withoute other depeacche. And sone after they made allyance with the Athenyans. Forsomuche as the Argiues had refusedde to enter into allyance with them. For they thoughte verely, that withoute the Athenyans, they coulde not do theym any greate hurte. And that the more parte of the Peloponesians would not meddle with the warre. But rather if they might they would ioigne with the Athenyans. Beinge than for a certaine tyme debated and reasoned of the sayed allyance in the cytye of Sparte by thambassadours of the Lacedemonyans, it was fynally concluded in the manner and fourme that followeth.

For the Corynthiens and some othere Cyties of Peloponese woolde not holde yt. And soone after moued a newe mutynerye and questyon bytwene the Lacedemonyans and the other confederates. And by successyon of tyme, those same Lacedemonyans came into greate suspytyon of the Athenyans, pryncipally by reasone of certayn articles of allyance whyche were not well executed.

Out of the whyche terme a man canne not by reasone subtray or take oute the tyme that the treatie of peace enduredde, for he that shall regarde whatte was done cannot iudge that the same yeare hadde annye effycacytie, considered that it was not executed nor obserued of the one syde nor of the other, in thynges that were namely spokenne of and appoynctedde. And on the othere parte bothe the one partie and the other dyd transgresse therein in the warre that was made at Mantynea and in Epidaure and in manye othere thynges. Also in Thrace those whyche had bene allyes were enemyes, and the Beotians made trefues for tenne dayes onely. wherfore he that shall truly accompte the tenne yeres, that the furst warre endured, and the tyme that passed by trefues, and howe longe the seconde warre endured, he shall fynde the reconynge of the yeares to be suche as I haue shewed and certayne dayes ouer. The whyche terme was pronostycated by the aunswers and oracles of the gods. For I remember to haue oftentymes harde saye of many people commonly that the same warre shuld endure three nyneths of yeares. Durynge whyche tyme I lyued in good helthe of my parsone, and of my vnderstandynge & dydde take payne to vnderstande all that than was done although I was in exile durynge the sayde tyme, the space of tenne yeares after that I hadde bene sente Capytayne of the armye by sea vnto Amphipolis.

happened after the sayd tenne yeares and also the disturbance of the trefues, and so vnto the ende, alle that was done in the sayd warre. After than that the peace was made for fyftie yeares and the allyance bitwene the Athenians and the Lacedemonians, & that the Ambassadours of the cyties of Peloponese which were come to Lacedemonie were retourned into their houses, like as hath bene aboue sayde: the Corynthyans practised to reallye themself with the Argiues. And at the begynnynge they dyd speake wyth some of the pryncipalleste of the cytie of Argos, shewyng them that insomuche as the Lacedemonyans had made allyance wyth the Athenyans their mortall ennemys, not for to defende the lybertie of the Peloponesians, but for to brynge them agayne into seruytude: it was very expedyente that the Argyues shulde deuise theron for to defende the common lybertie, and to perswade vnto all the fre cyties of Grece, that wold lyue in their lybertie and occordinge to their lawes: that they shulde make allyance with thē, for to geue ayde the one to the other, whan yt shulde be nedefull, and for to chose people and capytaynes that shulde haue authorytie for to prouyde in all affayres, to the entente that the enterpryses shulde be secrette, and that the commons specyallye shulde not be aduertysedde of the affayres, whereunto yt shulde be thoughte that they woolde not consente: for there were manye of theyme (sayde the s

And on the other syde the Argyues were amonge alle the Grekes the rycheste, for that, that they had not medled wyth the warre precedinge, by cause of thys, that they had allyance wyth bothe parties. By meane wherof duryng the sayde warre, they were enryched and encreased greately. By suche manner than wente the Argyues, drawynge to their allyance all the other Grekes, that wold allye themselfe vnto them wyth their good wylle. Amonge whome the Mantynyans were the furste and their adherentes, for that, that they had (the warre endurynge wyth the Athenyans) subtrahed one partie of the countreye of Arcadie from the obeyssance and amytie of the Lacedemonyans, and hadde tournedde it vnto them, wherof they doubted greately leste the sayd Lacedemonyans wold haue remembrance, though that, for that tyme they made no semblante therof. wherefore byfore that anny other inconuenyent happened vnto them, they were ryght wyllynge to ioygne themself wyth the sayde Argiues, considerynge that it was a greate and a puissaunte Cytie aswelle of people, as of ryches, suffyciente inoughe for to resiste the Lacedemonyans, and alsoo was gouernedde by the estate of the commynaltye aswelle as that same of the sayde Mantynyans. At

whose example, manye other cyties of Pelopenese dydde the lyke. For they assuredly thoughte that those Mantynyans woolde not haue done yt, but that they hadde vnderstoode some thynge therin more than comonly was knowin, and also in despyte of the Lacedemonyans, agaynste whome they were dyspleased, for manye causes. But pryncypallye for thys, that in one artycle of the peace, made bytwene the Athenyans and the sayde Peloponesyans, yt was spokene and confyrmedde by othe, that yt there were annye thynge, whyche semed for the beste to be takenne awaye or changedde, those of the two cyties, to wytte of Athenes, and of Lacedemonye myghte doo yt, wythoute therein makynge anny mention of the other confedered Cyties of Peloponese. whyche thynge dydde putt al the Peloponesyans into greate suspytion, leste the sayde twoo Cyties hadde accordedde and agrede for to subdewe theym. For they verelye thoughte, that if they hadde estemedde theyme, as theire allyes and confederates, they shulde haue couched and comprehended in the sayde artycle the othere cyties of Peloponese, aswelle as those twoo. whyche was the pryncipall cause that inducedde them to make allyaunce wyth the Argyues. The Lacedemonyans vnderstandynge that by lytle and lytle the sayde cyties dydde confederate themselfe wythe the Argyues, and that the Corinthiens hadde bene promoters and causers of that same matter, they sente certayne ambassadours vnto them for to shewe vnto them, as to the chiefe of that coniuration and acte, that if they departed from theire amytie & allyance for to ioygne themself wyth the Argyues, they shuld do against their othe, and moreouer shulde doo agaynste reasonne, for that they woold not approue the treatie of peace, made wyth the Athenyans, consideredde that the more parte of the confederated cyties had allowed it, and that by their allyaunces it was ordaynedde that the same whyche was donne by the moore parte, shulde be holden by the othere, yf there were none empeschemente of the goddes or of the saynctes. Upon thys declaration, the Corynthyans bifore makynge answere to the sayde Ambassadours, had caused all their allyes to assemble, to wyt, those, that hadde not yet accepted the treatie of peace, & by comon deliberation sayed vnto the sayde Lacedemonyans that they woolde confederate theymself agaynste them, and shewedde them certayne thynges, wherein those Lacedemonyans hadde done theyme wronge by concludynge the sayde treatie of peace. specially for thys, that by the same it was not prouydedde that the Athenyans shulde restore vnto them Sellie, Anactorium nor annye other places, whyche they pretended to be takenne from them by the sayde Lacedemonyens. And on the other parte, that they were not determyned for to habandone thē of Thrace, who, at their desyre and perswatyon, had rebelled from the Athenyans, for that, that they hadde promysed them particularly by theire othe not to forsake them, aswell at begynninge whan they rebelled wyth those of Potydea, as also at manye tymes afterwardes. wherfore they reputed not themself to be infractors or brekers of the allyance, that they had made wt the said Lacedemonyās, though they woulde not accepte the appoynctemente made wyth the Athenyans, considered that they myght not do it, withoute beynge periured towardes the sayde Thracyans. And by the Chapitre of their allyance it was ordeyned, that the lesser partie ought to accepte that, whych the greater partie shulde do, excepte, that yt were empesched and lette by the goddes or by saynctes. whyche thynge they reputed to haue happened in thys case. For by doinge contrary to their othe, they shulde offende the goddes, by whome they hadde sworne. And thys is it, whyche they aunswered concernynge thys artycle. To the remanante, as touchynge the allyance of the Argiues, they made them aunswere, that hauynge therupon consulted

wyth their frendes, they woulde doo that thynge that they shulde fynde to be iuste and reasonable. The Ambassadours of the sayde Lacedemonyans being vpon this despeche departedde: the Corynthyans caused those of the Argiues to come into their counsaille. whyche were already in the Cytie, bifore departure of the other, and shewed them that they ought not to deferre or put of to make allyaunce wyth them: but that they shulde comme agayne in the nexte counsaille for to conclude yt. In thys meane tyme the Ambassadours of the Elyans arryued, who furste dydde make allyance wyth the Corinthians. And fromthence by their ordenance they wente to Argos. where as they made the lyke, for also they were dyspleased wyth the Lacedemonyans for somuche as byfore the warre wt the Athenyans, certayn Arcadyans makinge warre agaynst the Leprates, they had recours to the Elyans, and promysed theym that yf they woulde succoure them they woolde geue themself vnto them after the warre fynished, and that after the sayde Arcadyans shulde be rechasedde, that they woolde also geue theym the moytie or one halfe of the fruictes of their lande. By occasyon wherof the said Leprates beinge delyuered from the warre, the Elians conuenanted wyth them that hadde landes for to laboure, that they altogithere shulde paye one talente of golde, whyche shulde be offred in the temple of Iupiter in Olympus. whiche trybute they payde wythoute contradictyon vntil the warre bitwene the Athenians and Peloponesians. But afterwardes they refused to paye yt, takynge their excuse vpon the charges, whyche they dyd susteigne by meane of the warre. And for that, that the Elyans woolde haue thereunto constrayned them, they repayred to the Lacedemonyans, vnto whome the sayde Elyans were contente for to commyt the questyon. But afterwardes fearynge leaste they woolde iudge agaynste them, they made no further pursuyte therin bifore them, but wente to ouerronne the lande of the sayde Leprates. That notwythstandyng the sayd Lacedemonyans dyd pronounce their sentence, whereby they dyd declare that the sayde Leprates were in nothynge bounden to the Elyans, and that those Elyans wrongfully and for an euyll cause hadde ouerronne their land. And the said Lacedemonyans parceyuinge that the sayde Elyans woolde not obey their iudgemente, they sente their people to the succours of the sayde Leprates. By occasion whereof the Elyans pretended that the Lacedemonyans had done against the treatie of allyance, whyche was made bytwene those Lacedemonyans and the othere Peloponesyans, by the whych yt was prouyded that the landes, that

And vpon this occasion they made allyance wyth the sayd Argiues. And soone after the Corinthians and the Chalcydes that be in Thrace dyd also make yt. The Beotians & Megarens were in wauerynge to do the lyke, pretendynge to haue bene smallye estemed by the sayde Lacedemonyans. But afterwardes they dydde take better aduysemente consyderynge, that the manner of lyuynge of the Argyues (which was the gouernemente of the common people) was not so conuenable for them, as that same of the Lacedemonyans, who dydde gouerne themselfe by a nomber of people, that is to say, by a counsaylle, whyche hadde all the authorytie.

               DUrynge the sommer, whereof we speake, the Athenyans dyd take the cytie of Sycione, and dyd slay all the men of .xiiii. yeres and vpwards, and dydde delyuer theire lande to the Plateans for to laboure, & moreouer dydde reduce and brynge agayne to Delos the Cytezeins that were dryuene and chasedde fromthence, hauynge regarde aswell to the dommaiges, which they had susteigned throughe the warre: as also to the oracles of the goddes. The Phocyans also and the Locrians beganne to warre among them. And the Corinthians and Argyues that already had made allyaunce togiders, came to the cytie of Tegee,Tegea. hopyng for to wythdrawe it from the obeissance and allyance of the Lacedemonians. And by meane thereof (considered that it hadde a great terrytorie) to withdrawe all Peloponese. But the Corinthians parceuing that those of Tegee wolde not departe from the Lacedemonyans for anny euyll wyll that they bifore tyme had had agaynste the same Lacedemonyans, they retourned very quickly, for they feared that no othere woolde afterwardes render themselfe vnto them, sens that those there had refused yt. And yet notwythstandynge they sente vnto the Beotians, for to require them, to be wylling to reallie themself wyth thē and with the Argyues, & to the reste that they shuld gouerne themself by common accorde. And moreouer for somuche as the sayde Beotians had takene a trefues of tenne dayes wyth the Athenyans, soone aftere the conclusyon of the peace of fyftie yeares, wherof we haue spokene here bifore: they requyred them that they woolde sende an Ambassade wyth theym to the Athenyans, to whome they wolde go for to compryse theym in the sayde trefues: and in case they woolde not do ytt, that the sayd Beotyans shuld renounce the said trefues, and shulde not afterwardes make annye treatie of peace nor of trefues wythout the sayde Corynthyans. whereunto the Beotiens made aunswere, that as touchynge the allyaunce, they woulde consulte and determyne vpon yt. And as for the reste that they woolde sende of theire people wythe theyme to Athenes and woolde requyre the sayde Athenyans to be wyllynge to compryse the sayde Corinthyans in the trefues of tenne dayes. But the Athenyans made aunswere that if the sayde Corinthyans were allyedde wyth the Lacedemonyans, they were suffyciently allyedde wyth them, and that they nededde no other thynge. Parceyuynge whyche aunswere the sayde Corinthyans made instance vnto the Beotians that they shulde renoūce the trefues of tenne dayes, but they woulde not for all that do it. And finally, the Athenyans were content to make trefues with the Corinthyans wythout anny allyance. That same sommer the Lacedemonyans wyth their armye vnder conducte of Plistoanactes, their kinge, went agaynst the Parrhasiens whyche be in the countrey of Arcadie,Parrhasii. subiectes of the Mantynyens called thider by certain of the cytezeins, by meane of a seditiō & mutynery which was amongest them: & also to thintente to rase downe the walles, whyche those Mantyniēs had made in ye town of Cypselle,Cypsele wherin they had put garnison. whiche towne was in the countreye of Siritide,Siritiū
                   in the terrytorie of the sayde Parrhasiens, in the lande of Laconye. The Lacedemonyans being than comme into

the sayd lande they dyd pyllage and waste it. Whiche perceyued by the Mantynians, they lefte the garde of their cytie vnto the Argiues. And they with their puissance went for to succour their subiectes, but seyng that they coulde not defende them bothe they retourned fromethence. And by that meanes the Lacedemonians restored the Parrhasiens into lybertie, and rased downe the sayd walles, afterwardes they retournedde fromethence into their houses. And they beynge retournedde the men at armes arryued, whiche were gone with Brasidas into the countrey of Thrace, whome Clearidas broughte agayne by sea after the peace made. And it was by decree publisshed and declared that all the esklaues whiche hadde bene in that same warre with the sayd Clearydas shoulde be franke & free, and might go to dwelle where they woulde. Whome he sone after did sende with certayne other for to inhabitt in the towne of Leprea in the territorye of Eliens in the countrey of Lacedonia beynge alreadye in warre wyth those same Elyens.

Durynge all the same somer the Athenyanes and the Peloponesians vsed and traffiqued merchandises togiders, although they suspected the one the oother. Chifely the Athenians and the Lacedemonyans frome begynnyng of the peace, forasmuche as they had not rendred nothere on the one syde nor of the other, that, whiche was accorded and agrede vpon. For the Lacedemonyans, who shulde first haue restored, had not rendred Amphipolis nor the other places, nother also had constrayned their allyes in the countrey of Thrace for to accept the sayd tratie of peace, nother lykewyse the Beotians and the Corinthians, though that they sayd continuallye, that if the sayd confederates woulde not accepte the treatie, they woulde ioigne themself with the sayd Athenyans for to constrayne them thereunto, and thereupon had assigned and prefixed a daye. But there was no mention thereof in wrytyng, that those, that would not ratefie and accept the sayd treatie, should be reputed ennemyes bothe of the sayd Athenians & Lacedemonyans. But the Athenyās parceiuing that the sayd Lacedemonyans did parfourme nothynge of that whiche they had promysed, in effecte they had no good opinion that they woulde kepe the peace. And for this cause they likewise delayde to render Pilus vnto them and also repented that they had delyueredde the prysoners that they had takene in the Islande. And so reteigned lykewyse the other townes whiche they shulde haue rendred by the sayd treatie, vntill the tyme, that the Lacedemonyans had accomplished on their partie. Whiche Lacedemonyans did excuse themself, saying: that they had done all that they coulde. For they had rendred the prysoners whiche they had and also hadde withdrawin al their men of warre whiche were in Thrace, and for effecte obsaruedde all that was in their power, but as for to restore Amphipolis, that the same was not in their puissāce. And to the surplusage, promysedde that they woulde parforce theymself to cause that the Beotians and Corinthians should enter into the treatie & that Panacte

should be rendred to the sayd Athenyans. And lykewyse all the Athenyans, that were prysoners in the countrey of Beoce required the same Athenyans that they would be willyng to rēder the citie of Pylus, or at the least, if they would not rē
                  der it, that they shoulde withdrawe the Messenyans & the esklaues, whiche they had put within it, lyke as the same Lacedemonyans had withdrawin their men of warre, whiche were in Thrace: and that they shoulde kepe the place with their oune people, if they woulde. In this manner durynge the same somer, passed all their affaires, to witte chiefly by dissymulacion, and neuerthelas dydde lyue without warre: communicatyng or entremedlyng the one with the other.
            
            
               Howe the Lacedemonians hauinge, againste the forme of the treatie agrede vpon with the Athenyans, made allyance with the Beotians wtout the same Athenians, they the sayd Athenians made the lyke with the Argiues, the Mantynyans and the Eolians. ☞The .vi. Chapter.
               THe wynter followinge, the Gouernours of the cytie of Sparte named Ephores beynge changed, vnder whome the peace was concludedde: and newe being chosē in their stede which were against the same: there was an assemblie made in Lacedemony: whereat were the ambassadours of the confederate cyties of Peloponese, those of the Athenians, those of the Corinthians and those of the Beotians, in the whiche manye thynges were debatedde, but fynallye, they departedde without any resolution. Neuerthelas euery man beinge retournedde to his house, Cleobolus and Xenares which were those two of the Ephores that than gouerned and desired to breake the peace: had particuler deuises with the Beotians and with the Corinthians, exhortynge them to haue parfaicte knowlaige of the sayd matters, and chiefly to the Beotians, that euen so as they had bene the furst that had made allyance with the Argiues, that so they shoulde be willing al togiders to ioigne themself afreshe with those same Lacedemoniās, shewyng thē that by the same meane they shulde not be constrayned for to accept & kepe the allyance with the Athenians, & that bifore the emnitie with the Athenians, & bifore that they had brokene trefues, the same Lacedemonians had more desired the amitie and allyance of the sayed Argiues than of the sayed Athenyans, for that, that they did alwayes mistrust them, and desired greatly to be assured therof vnderstāding, that their allyance shulde be to those Lacedemoniās right propice & me

                  e for to make warre wtout Peloponese, praying the sayd Beotians yt they would agree & be contente to restore Panacte to the sayd Lacedemoniās, to the intent yt by meane of hauing of that same cytie, they might recouer Pylus, if it were possible. And by meane therof begyn againe afterwardes more easely the warre against the Athenians. Thies thinges beyng signefied to the messēgers of the Beotians & of the Corinthiās by the sayd Ephores & certaine other their frendes of Lacedemony: they made their reporte therof to the counsell of their cyties. But bifore that they arryued, two of the chiefe officers of Argos came to encounter & mete thē vpon the waye, & had many deuyses with thē for to vnderstand if it were possible that the Beotians would enter into their allyance, lyke as the Corinthiās, the Mantiniens and the Eliens had done. Saying that, if that were done, they should be hable for to make warre againste the Athenians, orels welle by meane of the sayd Beotians and other their confederates: for to come to some good appoynctmente wyth them. Whiche thynges were ryght agreable to the Beotians for that they dydde agree vnto thesame,

that their frendes of Lacedemonye had charged theym, and that those Argiues consented to the thing, whiche the other desired. And so they stayed vpon resolution wyth theym, that they woulde sende their ambassadours into the countrey of Beoce, and that done they departedde. The Beotians beyng aryuedde in their countrey, they reapported to the gouernors of the cytie, all that, whiche they had vnderstandedde, aswelle of the Lacedemonyans as of the Argiues, wherewith those gouernours were welle pleasedde for that, the amytie bothe of the one and of the other was very mete and conueniente for them, and that of themselfe, the sayd parties dydde agree vnto one self ende, wythoute knowynge the one of the other. Soneafter came the ambassadours of the Argyues. Unto whome, after that they hadde bene heard, they made aunswere, that they would sende ambassadours vnto them for to treate of the allyance. In this meane tyme, those Beotians, the Corynthians, the Megarens, and the ambassadours of them of Thrace assembled themselfes togiders, and concluded amongest them an allyance, for to succoure the one the other against all those, that woulde warre against them, and that they myghte not make warre, peace nor other treatie with any parsone, the one wythoute the othere. And also it was appoynctedde that the Beotians and Megarens, who were alreadye allyedde, shoulde make allyaunce vpon the same condicions, wythe the Argiues. But bifore that the Gouernours of Beoce shoulde conclude the sayed thynges, they shoulde make reapporte thereof to the fower counsailles of the sayd countrey: who hadde all the auctorite, perswading theyme that they shoulde be wyllynge to consente to the allyance with the sayd cyties and wyth all the other that would ioigne wyth them, and shewing them that it was for their proffytte. Whiche thyng the sayed counsaylles would not at the firste brunte agree vnto, fearing that it should haue bene against the Lacedemonyans, if they shoulde haue allyed themself wyth the Corynthyans, who had rebelledde and were departedde frome theym. For the sayed gouernours hadde not aduertisedde them of the deuyses, whiche they hadde hadde with Cleobulus, Xenares and their other frendes of Lacedemonie. Whiche were, that they shulde furste make allyance with the Argiues and the Corinthyans, and afterwardes should conclude it with the Lacedemonyans. For the sayd gouernours thought assuredly that without declaring that same vnto the comons of the sayd fower counsailles, they woulde haue done that, whiche the sayd Gouernours woulde haue counsailledde them. But seing that it chaunced otherwyse therein, the Corinthyans and the ambassadours of Thrace retournedde fromethence withoute doinge any thynge. And the gouernours of the Beotians (who were determyned, if they coulde haue obteignedde and perswadedde the same furste vnto their people for to essaye afterwardes to haue made allyance wythe the Argiues) seinge that they coulde not obteigne it, dydde speake nothyng therof. Also the sayd Argiues, who shoulde haue sente their ambassade, dydde not sende it. So that the thynges remaynedde vndone by a necligence and throughe defaulte of sollycytynge. The selfe same wynter, the Olynthians dydde take the towne of Mecyberne with assaulte,Mecyberne. wherein the Athenians kepte their garnysone and pillaged it. After that, manye parlamentes beinge made bitwene the Athenyans and the Lacedemonyans, vpon the obseruaunce of the articles of the peace, specially vpon condicion of the places on the one parte and of the other: those Athenians, hopyng that if they dydde render Panacte vnto the Lacedemonyans, they woulde haue restoredde vnto theyme Pylus: sente an ambassade to the Beotians, prayinge theyme that they woulde delyuer the sayed towne togiders wythe the prysoners that they hadde of theirs. Whereunto the Beotians made aunswere that

they woulde not doo it, excepte the Lacedemonyans woulde make particuler allyance wyth theym, aswelle as they hadde done wyth the sayedde Athenyans. Whereupon the Lacedemonyans, thoughe they dyd knowe, that it was agaynst the allyance that was made with the Athenyans, whereby it was prouydedde that the one shoulde not make peace nor warre wythoute the othere, yett for the desier that they had for to recouer of the Beotians, Panacte, hopynge, by meane thereof to haue Pylus: and also for the inclynacion, whiche the officers than had, more to the sayed Beotians than to the Athenyans, to the intente to breake the peace: they made and accordedde the sayd allyance aboutes the ende of the wynter. After the whiche made, in the begynnynge of the furste sprynge tyme, whiche was the .xi. yeare of the warre, the Beotians rasedde and vtterly destroyedde the sayed towne of Panacte. The Argiues parceyuynge that the Beotians had not sent vnto them the ambassadours for to make the allyance, lyke as they had promysedde, and that they had beaten downe Panacte and made particuler allyance wyth the Lacedemonyans: they hadde greate feare least they alone shoulde remayne in warre wyth the sayed Lacedemonyans, and lest all the other cyties of Grece woulde reallye themself with theym. For they thought that that, whiche the Beotians had done at Panacte: was by knowlaige and with wyll of the sayd Lacedemonyans and also of the Athenyans, & that they were all of one allyance. With whiche Athenyans those Argiues hadde no more hope of appoynctmente. For that same, whiche they hadde thereof hadde was, thynkynge that the allyance whiche was bitwene theym and the Lacedemonyans, shoulde not haue endured. For this cause being in greate perplexitie, & fearyng leste that they should be forced to susteigne warre bothe agaynste the sayed Lacedemonyans and Athenyans and also agaynste the Theagites and Beotians, forsomuche as they hadde byfore tyme refused the appoynctemente with the sayd Lacedemonyans, & coueted the Empyre & the authorytie ouer all Grece: they sent their Ambassadours to the sayd Lacedemonyans, to wytt, Eustrophus and Eson,

For they thoughte that whan they shuld be allyed wyth them, to what souer ende ye matters shuld falle or come, they shuld be well assured for the time that than ranne. Beinge than the sayd Ambassadours arryuedde at Lacedemonye, they made theire proposition to the counselle, demaundinge peace and allyance. And for to treate yt, they dydde requyre that the difference that they hadde wyth the Lacedemonyans, by cause of Cynurie (which is in the terrytorie of the Argyues, and hathe vnder ytt woo cytyes, to wytte, Thyree and Athenye, and also ys peopled wyth Lacedemonyans) myghte be commytted to some cytie being newter, or to some notable parsonage trusty to both parties. wherunto the Lacedemonyans dyd incontynently make aunswere, that they shulde speake no moore therof. But if the Argiues woolde, they were contente to make a new treatie wyth theym, in all thynges, suche as the former was. Whereupon the Argiues made a certayne refusall, saynge that they were well contente to make the appoyntemente, suche as aboue: prouydedde that yt shulde be liefulle to aythere of the sayde partyes, notwythstandynge the sayde appoynctemente, to make warre agaynste the othere whan yt shulde seme good, throughe cause of the sayd Cytye of Cynurie, excepte that the othere partye were empeschedde wyth pestylence or wythe othere warre, lyke as at othere tyme yt hadde bene conuenauntedde betwene theyme, than, whan they hadde a battaille, whereof aythere of the partyes pretendedde to haue hadde the vyctorye, and so, that the warre shoulde not exceede the lymyttes of the sayede Cytye, and of hys terrytorye.

Whiche requeste semed at the begynnyng to the Lacedemonyans, very folyshe, but neuerthelas in the ende they dydde agree vnto it. For that, that they desyredde the amytie of the sayd Argiues. But bifore the concluding of any thynge, albeit that the ambassadours hadde full power and might, yet wylled they that they should retourne frome thence to Argos, and that they should propone and declare the sayd treatie to the commons, for to knowe if they were agreable vnto it. And if they were, that they shoulde comme againe at a daye appoynctedde for to swere to the sayd appoynctmente. So the ambassadours departed frome Lacedemony. But in the meane tyme that they shoulde haue retourned, the Ambassadours that the Lacedemonyans had sent to the Beotians, for to recouer Panacte, and the prysoners beinge Athenyans: to wytte Andromedes, Phedimus and Antimenides, they founde that the sayed Panacte was rasedde and plucke downe by the Beotians vnder colour, as they sayed, that there was an auncyente treatie bitwene them and the Athenyans, confirmedde by othe, by which it was ordonneide that neyther of the parties, shoulde inhabitt in the sayed place. And as touchinge the prysoners, they rendredde those that they hadde of the sayd Athenyans. Unto whome those ambassadours dydde sende them agayne. And as concernynge Panacte, they shewed them, that they shoulde no more feare that any their enemye shoulde abyde there, insomuche as the towne was pluckedde downe, thynkynge by that meane that they had welle acquited the promys that they hadde made for to render it. But the Athenyans were not therewith contēt, and shewedde theym that they had not accomplyshedde that, whiche they promysedde in rendrynge of the towne being destroyedde: and moreouer in hauing made allyance with the Beotians. For it was directly against that whiche was spoken and agrede vpon bitwene them to wytt, that they shoulde ioinctly togiders constraigne all the confederatedde cyties for to accepte and ratefie the sayd treatie of peace, to wytt, those, that would refuse it. By meanes of which thinges and of manye other they vsed the sayd ambassadours with grosse woordes, and sente them agayne withoute other conclusion. The Athenyans and the Lacedemonyans being than in this difference: they that were not contente to haue peace with the Athenes, they sought meanes to breake it incontynently through occasion thereof. And amongest other Alcibiades sonne of Clymas (who thoughe he was yett yonge, yett for the memorye of his progenitours, whiche were men of worshyppe, was greately bilouedde, and hadde greate auctorytie in the cytie) the same counsailledde the people, for to make allyance with the Argiues, aswell for that, that it semedde prossitable for them, as also for this that through the highnesse and fiercenesse of his harte, he was not content that the peace had bene made with the Lacedemonyans by Nycyas and Lachetes, without makynge estimation of hym for that he was yonge. And somuche the more he was offended with them, that they hadde renewed and establyshedde agayne the amitie with them whiche his grantfather hadde brokene and forsakene. And for despyte thereof he declared hymself than to be agaynste the sayed treatie of peace: and sayed openly that the Lacedemonyans were not to be trusted vnto, and that the appoynctmēt that they had made with them was but for to withdrawe the Argiues, fro their amytie, and afterwardes for to begynne againe warre agaynste them. And seing that the people grudged agaynst the sayd Lacedemonyans, he sent secretly with all diligence vnto the Argiues, signefying them, that it was the beste time that euer might be for to pursue the allyance, for the Athenyans desyred yt, and that they shoulde come without any delay and bring the Elyans and the Mantynyans for to conclude it, assuring that he woulde ayde them with his power. The

Argiues hauing the newes, and vnderstanding that the Beotians had not made allyance with the Athenyans, and also that those Athenyans were in greate discorde with the Lacedemonyans, they lefte the practique of their ambassadours, that treated the peace and allyance with the Lacedemonyans: and did geue thē
                  self to the same of Athenians. The which they reputed better and more proffitable for them than the other: for somuche as the cytie of Athens, had alwayes and of all auncientie bene their frende, and further dyd gouerne it self by the comon estate, lyke as they dydde, and moreouer myghte shewe them very muche ayde and fauour by sea if they had there warre, for that that therein it was moste puissante. And so they incontinently did sende their ambassadours with those of the
E
                     •
                  ians and of the Mantynyans to Athens for to treate & conclude the allyance. In that same tyme, the ambassadours of the Lacedemonians arryuedde at Athens, to wytt, Philocaridas,Philocaridas. Leon and Eudius,

                     Eudius
                   who semed to be moste affeccionedde to the Athenyans and to the peace. Whiche were sent aswell for feare that the Lacedemonyans had, leste those Athenyans would make allyance wyth the Argiues, for despyte of them, as also for to demaunde that they shoulde render vnto them Pylus in stede of Panacte, and also for to excuse themself of the allyance, which they had made with the Beotians, and for to shewe them, that they had not done it for any euill purpose nor to the preiudice of the same Athenians. Whiche thinges were by the sayd ambassadours proponed to the counsaylle of Athens. And besydes that, they declared that they hadde full power to conclude and appoyncte vpon all their difference and controuersies. Whiche seinge Alcibiades, and fearynge leste if the thynges were publyshedde and declared vnto the people, that they woulde consente to that, whiche they sayed, and by that meane refuse the allyance of the Argiues, he ymagyned one suche tromperie and deceite for to empesche it. That is that he didde speake secretly to the sayedde ambassadours
                     •
                   and sayed vnto them that they should not in any manner of the world declare to the comminaltie that they had ful might to trauaille and entrete vpon all the differences, promysinge them, that if they would so do, for to geue and restoore Pylus vnto theym, and that he had the meane and auctoritie for to perswade it vnto the comons, lyke as bifore tyme he had had to cause them to deny it to the other ambassadours of the Lacedemonians. And moreouer he promysedde that he woulde appoyncte and appease all the other differences that they hadde togiders. And this did he, to the intent, that he myght withdrawe theym fro the practique & knowlaige of Nycias. And also that by this meane he might
caliumniate and accuse theym towardes the comons that there were in theym nother trouthe nor loyaultie, and by that doynge to enduce the same commons for to make allyance with the Argiues, the Mantynyans and the Elians, lyke as it chaunced. For whan the ambassadours dydde comme to the assemblie of all the people, beinge demandedde if they had full power for to procede vpon all the differences, they sayed, nay. Whiche was whole contrarye to that, which they hadde sayedde to the counsaille. Whereby the Athenyans were so mouedde, that they woulde no more heare them. But dyd cleue vnto Alcibiades, who bigonne vpon this occasion, for to charge them with more, than bifore. So that through his perswation, they caused the Argiues and the other that were comme in their compaignie, to enter for to conclude allyance wyth theym. But bifore the matter was establishedde fully: the earth quaked, by occasion wherof, the thyng was put of or remytted vntyll the ne
                     •
                  te daye followyng. At whiche daye Nycyas perceyuing himself to be deceyued by Alcybiades, aswell as the Lacedemonyans, who were enduced to denye vnto the comons that, whiche they had sayd to the counsaille,

lefte not of for all that, to shewe afreshe vnto the assemblie, that the allyance ought to be made and renewed with the Lacedemonians, & that men ought to sende vnto them for to knowe more amply their intent, and in meane tyme to differre the allyance with the Argiues. Declaring vnto thē that it was their honour, and the shame of the Lacedemonians, for to differ the warre, for that, that they had the better, wherfore it was to their aduantage that they aboade in that reputacion, where the Lacedemonians, who remayned with the losse, had occasion to dsire warre. And so he perswaded them in that sorte that it was concluded for to sende an ambassade vnto the sayd Lacedemonyans. In the which among other was named that same Nycyas. And those ambassadors hadde charge to say to the sayd Lacedemonyans, that if they were willing to enter frankely into the busines and for to enterteigne the peace & allyance, that they shulde restore to the Athenians Panacte hoole, entier and reedefyed. And furthermore that they shulde departe with Amphipolis, and frome thallyance of the Beotians. And if they woulde not enter into the peace, so and vnder the conditions that were spoken: that is to wytt, that the one of the cyties myght not make treatie with an other cytie whatsoeuer, without the other: declaring vnto them furthermore, that if they would procede against the sayd treatie of peace and allyance, doinge contrary to that, whiche was agrede vpon: that than those Athenyans had already concluded to the allyance with the Argiues, whiche were at Athens, attendynge the resolution. And many other articles, conteigninge doleance against the sayed Lacedemonians, for that they had not kepte and obsarued the sayd treatie: were geuen by instruction to the sayd ambassadours for to make declaratiō thereof to the sayd Lacedemonians. The sayd ambassadours, than being come, and hauing expounded their charge to the Lacedemonyans, & for the last article hauyng signefyed, that if they woulde not forsake the allyance of the Beotians, in case they were not willynge to accepte the treatie of peace, as is afore sayd, the Athenyans woulde conclude the allyance with the Argiues & the other of their intelligence: they were forced to answere, throughe the perswation of Xenares and of his faction, that they would not departe frō he allyance of the Beotians. And neuertheles being required by Nycias for to swere againe to kepe & perfourme the treatie of peace and amytie, which was made bitwene them they were not therwith cō
                  tent. And that did Nycias fearing to haue retourned fromthence wtout hauing any thing done, leste that he shulde be charged to haue bene cause of the sayd treatie of allyance, lyke as it chaunced afterwardes whan he was come home againe. And moreouer incōtinently as the Athenians had vnderstāde his reaport, & that there was in effect nothing done: at the perswation of Alcibiabes, they concluded the allyance with the Argiues, which were there, holding them for oultraged or iniuried by the Lacedemonians. The tenoure of whiche allyance doth followe.
               
                  The tenour of the allyance bitwene the Athenyans, and the Argiues, the Mantynyens and the Elyans.
                  ALlyance hath bene made by the Athenians, wt the Argiues the Mantynians & the Elyens for a houndred yeares, aswel for thē as for their frendes, ouer whom both the one & the other partie doth preside & gouerne, without fraude & deceite, aswell by sea as by lande, to witt, that ye one partie maye not make warre nor endomage the other, nor their allyes, nor subiectes vnder any coulour or accasion whatsoeuer it maye be. And moreouer yt if any estranger during the said time shal haue entred ennemylike into ye lande of the sayd Atheniās, the sayd Argiues, Mantynians & Elyens shalbe bounde to come to succoure thē with al their puissance, fourthwith as they shalbe therunto

required by the same Atheniās. And if it chaunced that the sayd estrangers were already departed frō the lande of the Athenians, yet these Argyues, Mantyniens & Elyens shulde repute them for ennemyes, aswel as the Athenyās. And that it shall not be lawfull to any of the sayd cōfedered cyties to make any appoinctmēt with the sayd comon ennemyes wythout the will & consent of the other. And the Athenians shall do the like against those, that shall come to assaile the sayd Argiues the Mantynians & Elyans in their lande. And furthermore that none of the sayd cyties shall permytte nor geue congie or lycence to passe through his lande nor through that same of his frendes nor allyes, ouer whiche they preside or gouerne, nother yet by sea: vnto any warryours for to make warre, except it be deliberated and agrede by all the sayd foure cyties and sett fourth in their name. And that if one of the sayd cyties demaundeth succours and ayde of the people of the other: that the same that shall sende the sayd succours, shalbe bounde to furnyshe the sayd succours with victuailles at his expences the space of .xxx dayes to be reconned from the first day that the sayd succours shalbe arryued in that same citie that demaunded it. But if the cytie haue thereof nede for a longer tyme, it shalbe boūde to geue soulde to the sayd souldyars, to wytt, three half pence of monney, for the day to euery foote man and to the horsemen a grote. And by that meane the same cytie shall haue the auctorite oner the sayd men of warre, & they shalbe bounde for to obey it so long as they shalbe therein. But if any army were made fourth in name of all the sayd fower cyties, the Impery therof should be comon to all fower. The whiche treatie of allyance the Athenians shalbe bounden presently for to swere in the name of them and of their confederates and allyes. And afterwardes the lyke othe shalbe made in euery of the sayd three cyties & of their allyes in the moste straict fourme that they may haue in euery of them after his custome vpon the aulters of their temples, after that the sacrefice shalbe made apperteigning to the same, in suche substance as followeth. I sweare for to holde and kepe the allyance accordyng to the fourme and tenoure of the treatie, whiche hath bene accorded: iustely, loyally and symplie, and wolle not do to the contrarye: vnder any colour, art nor ymaginacion that may be. And the sayd othe shalbe made in the cytie of Athens, by the people of the senate and Trybuus. And afterwardes shalbe cōfirmed by the treasorers. In the cytie of Argos by the senate and by the foure skoore of the greate counsaille. Of Mantynea by the artificers, by the senate and by other officers and shalbe confirmed, by the diuynours & by the capytaynres of the warre. At Elea or Elides, by the artificers, by the threasorers, sixe houndred of the greate counsaille, and shalbe confirmed by the conseruators or kepers of lawes. The whiche othe shalbe yearely renewed, to wytt, first by the Athenyans, who shall go for that intente and purpose, to the other three cyties thirty dayes bifore the Olympyades. And afterwardes the other cyties shall go to Athens for to do lykewyse, tēne dayes bifore the great feast, that is named Panathenea. And the present treatie with the othe shalbe wryttone in stone and sett in a publique place at Athens, in the moste euidente and open place of the cytie. At Argos in the markett place by the tēple of Apollo. At Mantinea and at Elides, in the markett place night by the temple of Iupiter. And moreouer at the next Olympyan feast it shalbe sett vp in the name of al the sayd foure cyties in a table of copper. And the same cyties maye by comon accorde adde to this sayd treatie hereafter that, whiche they shalle thynke good. In this manner the allyance & confederation was concluded bitwene the sayd fower cyties, notwithstanding that there was nothinge sayd nor any mention made, that for the same any man shoulde departe frome the treatie of peace and allyance made bitwene the sayd Athenyans and Lacedemodya

               Howe after many enterprises and exploictes of warre, that were made bitwene the allyes of the Lacedemonians on thone parte, and those of the Athenians of the other: the sayed Athenyans at request of the Argiues, declared those same Lacedemonyans to haue done against the treatie of peace and of allyance, and to be pariured. ☞The .vii. Chapter.
               THis allyance & confederacion was not agreable to the Corynthyans. And beinge by 
                     •
                  he Argiues their allyes required to ratefie and swere vnto it, they refused that to do. Saying that the same was suffycient, which they had made with the sayd Argiues, Mantynians & Elyans. By the which they had promised not to make peace
                     •
                   nor warre the one citie without the other, and for to ayde, by defending, the one the other without passing further, and to geue thē ayde in assaillinge. And by this meane the Corynthians departed from that same allyance & did take newe intelligence with the Lacedemonyans. Al which thinges were done in that somer, in the which Androsthenes the Arcadian did wyn the beste prize with wresteling at the feast Olympian.Androsthenes. At the same feast, the Elyans defended and enterdited vnto the Lacedemonyans that they shulde not sacrefice in the temple nor also enter into tourneying nor wrastlynge: excepte they payde the penaltie & amendes, wherein they were by the sayd Elyans condempned accordynge to the lawes and statutes of Olympiades, by this reasone: that they sayd that the sayd Lacedemonyans had putt & bestowed harnnes within the wall of Phircus and had sett their men of warre within Lepreum during the treatie made at Olympus & agaynst the tenoure thereof.
                     Phircus.
                     Lepreū.
                   The whiche mulcte and amendes did amount vnto two thousande poundes of Siluer, to wytt, for euery one of the sayd men of armes, who were a thousande, two poundes, lyke as the treatie dydde beare it. Wherunto the Lacedemonyans answered that they were vniustly condempned, forsomuche: as whan they hadde sente their men of warre vnto Lepreum, the treatie was not publyshedde. But the Elyans replyed that they coulde not be ignorante thereof, for the same treatie had already bene in their handes, and they themselfes were the firste that had denounced and signefyed it vnto the sayd Elyans, and yet neuerthelas in goyng agaynste yt, were comme to make the sayed exploicte of warre agaynste theym wrongfully? and agaynste reasone, wythoute that, that the same Elyens hadde innouatedde any thinge agaynste theym. Whereupon it was by the Lacedemonyens argued. That if it were so that the sayed Elyans vnderstoode whan they came to denounce the sayed allyance to the Lacedemonyans that they hadde alreadye done agaynste the same, it had not bene nedefull further to haue shewed yt vnto theyme (as they hadde done) after the tyme that they pretended the sayd exploictes of warre to haue bene done by the same Lacedemonyans. And that it shulde not be founde that after the same denouncyng, they had innouated or attempted any thynge. But the Elyans persisted neuerthelas in their opynion, the sayd allegacion notwythstandyng. And yet for all that offred theym, that if they woulde render Lepreum vnto theyme, they woulde be contente to remytte one parte of the amendes, to wytt, that same that ought to be applyed to theym, and also of the other, whiche ought to be applyed to the God Apollo, & to paye it for them. The whiche offer the sayed Lacedemonyans woulde not accepte. Whiche parceyued, the Elyans made thē yett an other offer. To wytt, that insomuche as they would not restore Lepreum, to thintent yet that they should not remayne

excluded frome the same feaste of the temple, that they shoulde swere vpon the great aulter of Iupiter bifore al the Grekes, for to paye the sayd amendes, if they than coulde not pay it. But the Lacedemonians accepted this partie as sklēderly as the furst. By reason wherof they were excluded & prohibited from sacrifice & to be present at the playes for that feast, and made their sacrifices in their cytie. And all the other Grekes came & assisted & were present at the playes
                     •
                   resarued those of Lepreum. And yet notwithstanding the Elyans, fearing l
                     •
                  ste the Lacedemoans shoulde come to the temple & would sacrifice by force, they caused a good nō
                  ber of their people to come in armure for to kepe watche in the tēple. And wt them were sent from Argos & from Mantinia two thousande men in armure, to wytt, from aither cytie a thousande, & besydes that, the Athenians sent thider the horsemen that they had at Argos, attending there the festyuall day. The which neuerthelas had great feare to be assailled and beaten by the Lacedemonians. And specially after that one Lacedemonyā named Lychas sonne of Arceselaus had bene skourged with roddes by the sargeantes vpon the place of the combate:Lychas for that that his wagone hauing bene confiscated to the Beotians: for that, yt it had ronne in the sayd place with the other: which thing was not liefull the play & the combate being forbyden to the Lacedemonians, in despraysing and cōtempning the sayd iudgement, for to geue it the better to be vnderstāde that he would wel that euery one shulde knowe that the sayed charett was his, he had openly vpon the place crowned his wagoner. Whereof the other had great feare, thinking that he durst not haue done it, if that he had not perceyued some enterprise of the Lacedemonyans, Who neuerthelas sturred not for that same time, and in suche sorte passed the feast. After the whiche, the Argiues and their allyes dyd come to Corynthe, to praye the Corynthians that they shulde be wylling to sende vnto them for to enter into their allyance. In whiche place metinge lykewyse the ambassadours of the Lacedemonyans, they hadde very muche talke of the treaties togiders, but fynally hearinge a thonder, as they were assembled for to entreate therof, they departedde without any conclusion, and euery man retournedde into his cytie, and no other thynge was done for that same somer. In the begynnynge of of the wynter followynge, the Hera
                     •
                  lyans that be in Trachine had a battaille againste the Enyens, the Dolopes, the Melyans & some other people of Thessale: who all were their voysins and their ennemyes. For that that the said cytie was founded
                     •
                   peopled and builded for none other ende, but agaynste theym. And for that cause frome begynnynge that yt was buyldedde, they neuer ceassedde to ymagyne for to destroye it. Of whiche battaille the Heraclians had the worse and therein dyed manye of their people, and amonge othere Xenares of Gnide Lacedemonyan, who was their leader and capytayne generall. And so passed the wynter: whiche was the twelfe yeare of the warre. In the begynnynge of somer, the Beotians didde take the cytie of Heraclea into their handes, and dyd chase fromthence Hegesippidas the Lacedemonyan,Hegesippidas. who had the gouernance thereof
                     •
                   saying that they gouerned it not wel, & that they feared that the Lacedemonyās, beinge occupied in Peloponese, leste the Athenyans shoulde take it. Wherewith the Lacedemonyans were ryght euylle contentedde towardes those Beotians. In the same somer Alcibiades, Duke of the Athenyans wyth the ayde of the Argiues and other their allyes wente into Peloponese hauing a small nomber aswel of men at armes, as archers. and of the confederates suche nomber as he founde in readines. and trauersynge the sayed countrey of Peloponese, he gaue order for that, which semed necessary for the season. And among other thinges he perswaded those Patras that they shulde make walles from their towne to the sea, & he

was mynded for to haue made one on the syde that was towardes the coste of Achaia, but the Corynthians & the Sycynians, whiche parceyued that the same shulde make against them, did empesche it. In the same somer was great warre bitwene the Epidauriās and the Argiues, vndercouleur of this, that Thepidaurians hadde not sent an offeringe to the temple of Apollo Pythius, as they were bounde to do, the whiche temple was in the iurisdiction and power of the Argiues. But in trouthe it was for this, that the sayed Argiues and Alciabiades dyd searche some occasion for to take and occupie the sayed towne, if they myghte, aswelle for to be more sure agaynste the Corynthyans, as also for this, that frome oute of the porte of Egyne, they myght trauerse thider more easely and more directly: than for to go frome Athenes to enuyrone the promontorye of Scellea.Scellea And so the Argiues preparedde theymself for to go into armure and with force to recouer the sayed offrynge of the Epydauryans. In that same tyme, the Lacedemonyans yssuedde fourthe into camps wyth all their puissance. And assembledde themselfe at Leutra,Leuctra whiche is a towne in their territorye, vnder the conducte of Agis sonne of Archidamus their kynge,Agis. who was wyllynge to conducte theym agaynste Lycee,Liceum although he hadde not discoueredde his intente to anny parsone in the worlde. But in sacrefyinge for their voiage, they coulde not fynde that the goddes woulde be propice or fauorable to theym therein. By reasone whereof, they retournedde fromethence, euery man into his house. And neuerthelas bifore their departure, they concludedde amonge themself that they shoulde assemble togiders agayne in the moneth followynge, whiche was the moneth of Iune. And after that they were disassembledde or disseuered, the Argiues yssued with all their power aboute the ende of May. And hauynge iourneyedde all that same day, they entred into the lande of Epidaure, and so didde piliage and waste it. Whiche parceiued, the Epidauriens sent vnto the Lacedemonyans and their oother allyes for to haue succours. Of whome, some excusedde themselfes that the moneth, whiche was to them assigned for to reassēble themself, was not yet come. The other came to the confynes of the Epidauriēs, and there rested, without passing any further. And in the meane time that the Argiues were in the lande of the Epidauriās, there came to Mantinea the ambassadours of the other cyties, their confederates, at the instigacion of the Athenians. And after that they were al assembled, Euphanidas the Corinthiā proponed & shewed,Ephamidas. howe that the effectes, were not lyke to the woordes, insomuche as they obserued the woordes of peace and yett neuerthelas in the meane tyme, the Epidaurians and their allyes, were assembl
                     •
                  d in armure against the Argiues. Wherfore it was reasonable, that the men of warre shulde retyre on bothe sydes, and after yt, the treatie of peace shulde be renewed. Wherunto the ambassadours of the Athenians did accorde, & by that meane caused their people, which were in the lande of the Epidauriās, to retyre. And afterwardes they reassembled themself altogiders for to create of the peace. But being departed without conclusion, the Argiues marched afreshe in armure to ouerrone & pillage the countrey of Epidauriens. And in the self time the Lacedemoniās yssued for to go against the Caryās, but not hauing ye sacrifices propice or fauourable for the voiage, they retourned frōthence. As touching the Argiues, after yt they had brent & wasted about the third parte of the lande of Epidauriēs, they retyred, With whom Alcibiades was come fro the citie of Athens, wt a thousand men. Understanding yt the Lacedemoniās were yssued into the feldes. Who being aduertised yt they retyred, retourned likewise himself, & in thies entrefaictes passed that same somer. In the beginning of wynter the Lacedemonyans sente, secretly and without knowlaige of the Athenians, by sea, three houndred mē to

the succours of the Epidaurians, vnder the conduct of Hegesipidas. Through occasion wherof the Argiues sente to the Athenians to shewe theym that though, that it was sayd and ordeyned in their allyance, that none of their confedered cyties shulde suffer to passe by their landes, nor by their seas anny ennemyes of the other marmure: they had neuerthelas suffred the people of the Lacedemonyās to passe by their sea for to go into Epidaure. Wherefore it was resonable that the Mantynyans and their sklaues shulde passe in their shippes and be transported vnto Pylus. And that doing otherwise, they shulde do them wrong. Upon which demaunde Alcibiades and Laconicus caused to be grauene in stone and to make declaracion by the Athenians,Laconicus. howe the Lacedemonians hadde broken their appoynctmente & falsefyed their othe. And vnder this coloure, they embarqued the esklaues of the Argiues at Eraine, and landed thē in the lande of Pylus, without doing other thing for that wynter. During yt whiche, the Argiues were in warre with the Epidauriens, but there was no rengedde battaile, but onely inroades, escharmouches and encountringes. And coming vpon the ende of wyntere, the Argiues came by night with ladders for to take the towne of Epidaure by assaulte, thynkyng that there hadde bene no people of defense within it, and that all hadde bene in the feldes, but they founde it hooly otherwyse, and retournedde fromethence wythoute anny thynge done. In this manner passed the wynter, whiche was the ende of the thirtenth yeare of the warre.
            
            
               Howe the Lacedemonians with their allyes beinge prest and readye to fight with the Argiues and their frendes, bifore the cytie of Argos: A trefues was takē by the chiefe men capytayne for. iiii. monethes, without consent of the of warre. And howe the sayd trefues were broken on the bihalfe of the Argiues at perswation of the Athenyans, and howe they toke the cytie of Orthomenia. ☞The .viii. Chapter.
               THe somer following the Lacedemonyans, seing that the Epidaurians their allyes were trauailled with warre, and that manye places of Peponese departed from their amytie, and other were in greate variance, & that if they made no prouision therefore their affaires would alway growe from euill into woorse: they al armed themselues togiders wt their bondemen vnder conducte of Agis sonne of Archidamus their kyng, for to go againste Argos hauing with them the Tegetes, with al the other Arcadians, that were of their allyance. And to the other allyes of Peloponese: and of other places, they cō
                  manded that they shulde be at Philunte.Philunces. Which thing they did, that is to witt, the Beotians wt fyue thousand footemen wel armed, & as many light armed, & from the other places, euery man sente thider accordinge to their puissance. And chiefly the Philisiens, forsomuche as the assēblie was made in their territorye, they sent al thider asmany of their people as they coulde make. The Argiues vnderstāding the enterprise of the Lacedemonians, and that they dyd go vnto Philunte, for to ioigne wt their other allyes: they came to mete thē with their puissance, hauing in their cōpaignye, the Mantynians with their allyes & three thousande Elyās wel armed, & did entounter thē nigh to Methydrie,Methydrium. which is a towne in the countrey of Arcadie. And so aither of the parties did his best to wyn the moūtaigne, & the Argiues prepared themself to geue the battaill bifore yt the sayd Lacedemoniās shoulde haue bene ioigned with those that were at Philunte. But Argis in the night departed fromthence for to go to the sayd Philunte. Wherof the Argiues

being aduertysed, they departed at ye breake of the day & went frōthence straight waye vnto Argos, and fromthence to the waye that leadeth to Nemea,Nemea. by the whyche they thoughte, that the Lacedemonyans shulde haue passed. But Agis, who doubted therof, had taken an other way more sharpe and more difficille, hauynge the Lacedemonyans, the Arcadyans and the Epidaurians wyth hym. By the whiche way they came for to descende into the lande of Argiues by one other coste. And the Corynthyans, the Pallyans and the Philasians by an other coste in the sayde waye. As touchynge the Beotians, Megarens and Sycionians yt was vnto them ordonned, that they shulde descende by the sayde waye that leadeth vnto Nemea, whereunto the Argyues were gone, to the intente that if the sayde Argyues wolde descende into the playne for to go to repoulse the Lacedemonyans that came the lowe waye, they shulde charge vpon them at their backes wyth their horsemen. The affayres than beynge so ordonned, Agis entred by the playne into the coūtrey of the Argyues, and pyllaged Samynthe and some small villages there abouts,Saminthus. whyche parceyued the Argyues yssuedde fourth of Nemea at the breake of daye for to go

                  ber of the sayd Philasians. But there was welle as many of theirs slayne by the Corinthians. On the other syde
                     •
                   the Beotyans, Megarens and Scycionians did kepe the way, whereunto they were appoyncted, and dyd come strayghte way to Nemea, frowhence the Argyues were alreadye departed and descended into the playne. And after that they were there, seinge their goodes pyllaged and wasted, they dydde put themself in arraye for to fyght agaynste their ennemyes. who also dyd the lyke on their partie. But the Argiues dyd fynde themself enuyronned on all sydes, to wytte, on the side of the playne wyth Lacedemonyans and other, were in their compaigny, whyche were betwene them and their cytie, from of the syde of the mountaigne, wyth Corynthyans, Philasiēs, and Pallians: and from of the coste of Nemea, wyth Beotyans, Sycyonyans and Megarens, and alsoo they hadde no horsemen. For the Athenyans that shulde haue brought theyme. were not yet arryued, and also they thoughte not to haue had so greate affayre, nother that there had bene so many ennemys. But rather they hopedde, being in their lande and wythin viewe of their cytie to haue obteigned a glorious victorie agaynste the Lacedemonians. The twoo armyes than being ready to combate, twoo of the Argyues, to wytte, Trasylus that was one of the fyue Capytaines and Alcyphron, who had greate acquayntance & a house at Lacedemonye, came to speake wyth Agis for to empesche that there shulde be no battaille, offryng on the bihalfe of the Argiues, if the Lacedemonyans pretended any quarell against them, for to obey to the ryght, prouyded that they shulde do the lyke for theire partie, and that done for to enter into allyance wyth them. Whiche offres ye saide two Argyues dyd make of their pryuate authoryte wythout knowlayge or cō
                  sente of the othere. wherunto Agis made them aunswere, likewise without therevnto calling anny other parsone, but only one of the iudges or threasurers of the armye, who was appoynctedde to hym for a compaignyon in that same warre. & amongest them four they concluded a trefues for foure moneths. Duryng the which tyme, the causes aboue sayd shuld haue bene treated vpon. And that done Agis retyred wyth hys people wtout speaking otherwise to any of the allyes nor also wyth the Lacedemonyans. All the whyche dyd followe him for that, that he was generall of the armye, and for to obsarue the souldarly lawe and disciplyne. But that not wythstandynge they blamed hym greatly, for thys, that hauynge one so greate and apparante occasyon of victoire, consydered that the ennemyes

were enclosed on all sydes, aswell wyth footemen, as also wyth horsmen, he departed fromthence wythout doynge there annye thynge worthye of so fayre an armye, whyche was one of the greatest that the Grekes had yet made in all that warre, and retyredde all vnto Nemea, where they soiournedde certayne dayes. Beynge in whyche place yt was iudged by all the Capytayns and chief of warre, that they were puyssaunte ynough for to defeate, not only the Argiues and their allyes, but also muche more people if they had bene there, and fromthence they retourned all throughly angred, euery one vnto hys quarter. But yet the Argyues were more displeased agaynste the twoo
                     •
                   whyche hadde accordedde the appoynctmēt for their partie, saying that the Lacedemoniās shuld neuer haue had so honneste occasion for to wythdrawe themself to their aduauntaige, for they thoughte that hauinge so fayer an armye, aswell of their owne people, as of their allyes: and moreouer beynge wythin the viewe of their cytie, they shulde easelye haue defeated the sayde Lacedemonyans. Beinge than departedde fromthence, they went altogyders into the towne of Charadrus,Charadrus. in the whyche, before that they entred into their cytie, & wold leue of their armure, they were willyng both to knowe of the warre and to determyne of the questyons of the warre and of the mylytary & souldearly causes. And so they concluded amonge other for to stoane Thrasylus. But he saued hymself wythin the temple, and yet neuerthelas they confiskated all his monney that he had there. In thies enterfaictes, and they beynge yet there, aryued a thousand fotemen & fyue hoūdred horsmen, whom Lachetes and Nicostratus brought vnto them from Athens, vnto whom they said that they shulde retourne, for it greuedde theym to breake the appoinctemente that hadde bene concludedde wythe the Lacedemonyans, in whatsoeuere manner, that it hadde bene made And although that the sayde Capytaynes of the Athenyans demaunded to be presentedde wyth their people vnto the comynaltie of Argos, yet the sayde Capytaynes of the armye woolde not agree vnto yt, vntill that the Mantynyans and the Elyans, wythe greate requeste, hadde obteignedde yt of the Argyues. Beynge than broughte in bifore the commons of Argos and byfore the allyes that were yett there, Alcibiades, who was generall of all the bende, shewedde theym that they hadde no power to make peace nothere treatye wythe the ennemyes, wythoute their consente, and sithens that he was there acyuedde at the terme that he hadde promysed wythe hys bende, that they oughte to begynne the warre agayne. And in suche manner he perswaded theym by hys oratyon, that they departed all at that presente for to goo agaynste Orchomenia, whyche is in the countrey of Arcadie, excepte the Argiues. who, albeit that they hadde bene of the same opynyone, were neuerthelas slacke, but soone afterwardes they dydde followe the othere, and all togyders dydde laye siege to Orchomenia, and vsedde all the force that they myghte, for to take yt, aswelle wyth Engynes of artillerye as otherewyse, for they hadde greate desyre to take the same towne for manye reasons: but pryncypallye for thys, that the Lacedemonyans hadde bestowedde there wythin yt, all the hostages that they hadde takenne of the Arcadyans. The Orchomenyans fearynge to be takenne by force byfore that the succoures myghte comme vnto theyme, for that, that theire walles were not stronge, and that the ennemyes were in ryghte greate nomber: they made appoynctemente wyth theym, by meane whereof they became theire allyes, in rendrynge the hoostages that were wythin the towne, and in delyuerynge some for theymselfe vnto the Mantynyans. Aftere that the Athenyans and othere allyes hadde takenne Orchomenia, they deuysedde whider they shoulde goo at theire departure fromethence. For the Elyans woolde that they

shulde haue gone into Lepreum, the Man

The other abodde at Mantinea and preparedde them selfe for to go to Tegea, where they had some cōfederation wyth certaine of the people of the towne, who shulde haue brought them into it. The Lacedemonyans, after that they were retourned from Argos, blaymedde greatly Agis, for the trefues that he had made, and that he had not brought the sayde cytie into their obeissance: hauynge the fairest occasion and the beste meane that euer they myghte haue hadde, nothere wythoute greate payne coulde haue. For yt semed vnto them very difficille and harde for to assemble agayne at an other tyme, one so fayere an armye of theire allyes as that same was there. But whan the newes came of the takynge of Orchomenus, they were muche moore angry and anymated agaynst hym. In such sorte that they determyned to beate and battre downe hys howse, whyche thynge had not bene sene in the cytie, and for to condempne hym in a houndred thousande drachmes, so greate was their anger against him. Yet notwythstandinge he so excused hymself and made vnto them so many requestes, thereby promysinge to recompense

The other marched straighte fourthe to Tegea, and they beynge there arryued, sone after came the Arcadyans, and besyde thys, they commaunded the Corynthyans, the Beotians, the Phocyans, & the Locryans

But for that, that of force they muste passe through the lande of the ennemys, they were constrayned to attende and tary for the othere, and yett neuerthelas dyd vse the

beste dyligence that they coulde for to passe. The Lacedemonyans with the Arcadyans that they had, inuaded the lande of Mantynea, and there dyd all the euill that they could. Hauyng lodged their host bi

                  e in a hyghe place, stronge ynoughe and harde for to aboorde or to enter vpon, and there they preparedde themselfe for to comme to the battaille agaynste the Lacedemonyans, who lykewyse marchedde in order for to combate. And beynge with in the caste of a stoane or of a darte, nighe vnto the ennemyes, one of the mooste auncyente of hys bende, seynge that they wente for to assault their ennemyes in theire force: cryed greatlye and wyth a lowde voyce vnto theym, Agis wolle amende one euylle, whyche he hathe done, wythe one othere moore greatte, wyllynge to geue it to be vnderstande, that thynkinge to amende the faulte whyche he hadde done at Argos, he woolde hazarte that same battaylle agaynste reasonne. Agis than vnderstandynge this, for feare that he hadde to be reprehendedde and rebukedde, if that he hadde assailled the ennemyes in their forte, or els rathere for thys, that it semed vnto hym not to be to purpose: he retyredde wyth hys people wythoute fyghting. And whan he was in the lande of Tegea, he dyuertedde and dydde tourne the water, frome the ryuer that passed throughe that countreye, into the lande of Mantynea. By reasonne of whyche ryuer, the Tegeans and the Mantynyans hadde oftentimes hadde question, 
                     •
                  or that, that yt wasted the landes, in that parte therof, where it hadde course. This dyd Agis, for that, that he woolde by that meane constrayne the Argiues & their allyes, to descende oute of their forte, wherein they were lodgedde, for necessytye of water, and to cause theyme to come into the playne, to the ende that he mighte combate in a reasonable or indifferente place, and so he aboode in that same place for to diuerte and tourne awaye the water all that daye. The Argiues and their allyes were furste abashedde of thys, that the Lacedemonyans were so soubdaynelye departedde, and coulde not thinke the cause of theire departure. Afterwardes seynge that they were retyredde, and that they hadde not pursued them, they chargedde theire Dukes and Capytaynes therewyth, sayinge: that furste they hadde suffredde them to passe by appoynctemente, whan they myghte haue destroyedde them bifore Argos, and nowe that they were fledde, that they wold not followe them, and by that meane, the ennemyes hadde wyth their ayse saued themself, and that they were deceyued and betrayed by their sayde Capytaynes. who were through that murmuration much troubled, and yet neuerthelas did afterwardes departe oute of their forte, wherin they were wyth their people, and descendedde into the playne, to the intente for to pursue their ennemyes. And the day followynge, they marchedde in battaille, determynedde to fyghte agaynste them, if they myghte mete or fynde theyme. On the othere syde the Lacedemonyans, who were retourned from the ryuer into their furste Campe, nygh to the temple of Hercules, parceyuinge them to comme towardes them, were more afrayd, than euer at any time bifore, within the remēbrance of man, they had bene. For that, that the thinge was so soubdayne, that skarcely they hadde space 
                     •
                  or to putte themselfe into battaylle araye. Notwithstandinge they toke harte of grace and recouered their espryttes in
                     •
                  ontynently, and euery man dyd putt himself in order at commandement of Agis their kyng. who had, by order of their lawes, al the authorytie to cōmaunde and ordeyne the Dukes of the armye, whyche were the chiefeste vnder hym. And afterwardes, the Dukes commaunded the Trybunes, the Trybunes the Centurions, and the Centurions the Dixeniers or rotter men, rulers of euery nomber of tenne, for such is their order. By means wherof,

whatsoeuer was requisyt to be done, was quickly executed, for a great parte of the people that be in their hooste, haue charge the one ouer the other, and soo there be founde manye that haue charge of the affayres. At that same tyme the Scirites by their oune accorde placed themself in the lefte poincte.Scirites. For such, from all auncyente, was the order of the Lacedemonyans, and wyth them, those, whyche hadde bene in Thrace wyth Brasidas and those that had newly bene affranchised and putt into lybertie. After them there were the othere Lacedemonyans in bendes accordynge to their order, and ioigninge to them the Arcadyans. And in the ryght poynct, the Menalyans, the Tegeates and a small nomber of Lacedemonyans. who kepte the poyncte, and the horsemen the wynge. On the othere syde the ryghte poyncte was commyttedde to the Mantynians, for that, that the feate was done in their lande. After theym, were the Arcadyans of theire partie, and a thousande ordenarye Souldears. vnto whome the Argiues dydde geue ordenary soulde or wages, for that, that they were well experymented for the warre, and after them, were all the Argyues, and successyuely the Cleonians and the Orneates their allyes, and fynally at the ende of the lefte poyncte were the Athenyans wyth their horsmen. Suche was the order of bothe the battaills, and albeit that the Lacedemonyans were of the greater apparance, yet coulde I not for trouthe descryue the nomber of the people, nothere of the one syde nor of the other, nother of them both togiders. To wyt, of the Lacedemonyās for that, that they do their feates very secretly and in greate sylence: and of the other, for that, that they make them so greate, that that, why the they saye, is not to be beleued. But yet neuerthelas the nomber of the Lacedemonyans may be coniectured by thys, that seuen bendes of theirs dyd fyght besides the Scyrites, who were fiue houndred. In euery of whychebendes, were .v. Centuries, and in euery Centurie, two Manipules, and in ayther Manypule there were foure men a fronte at the poinct. But more inner in the depth therof, there were more or lesse accordyng to the discretion of the capytaynes and Bandoliers. And yet neuerthelas euery order was of the thicknes of eight men, and the fronte of al the former seueral bendes was ioygned and locked egally in lengthe, and there were foure houndred, forty and eyght men in the furste poyncte, besydes the sayd Scyrites. After that they were thus all sett into battaille araye, aswell of the one syde as of the other, euery capytayne exhorted & encouraiged hys souldears, the beste wyse that they coulde: to wytt, the Mantinians declared to their people, that the questyon was, o
                     •
                   losinge their seignyory and lybertie, and of their comynge into seruytude. The Argyues shewed vnto theirs, that the questyon was to defende their princypalitie, whyche was egall to the same of the other cyties of Peloponese, and also for to reuenge the oultrages and iniuryes, that their voysins & ennemys, had oftene tymes done vnto them. The Athenyans proponed vnto theirs that it shulde be their honnour (sithens they dyd fyght wyth so greate nomber of their allyes) to shewe that they were no worse warryours thā the other, and also if they coulde at the selfe instante vainquyshe and destroye the Lacedemonyans in the countrey of Peloponesa, their estate and seignyorye shulde foreuer be in the greatter suertie, for there shulde neuer be any people that durste comme to assaylle them in their landes. Such were the sayinges and perswations that were made to the Argiues and their allyes. As touchynge the Lacedemonyans they were all assured people and experte in warre, werefore they hadde no nede of exhortatyon. For the memory and recordynge of their many and cheualerour feates dyd geue thē more hardynes, than a shorte declaratyon (though yt hadde bene welle garnysshed wyth wordes) coulde haue done. Thys passed they, beganne to marche the

one agaynste the other, to wytt, the Argyues and theyr allyes wyth greate impetuosytie or fiercenes, and wyth greate wrathe and anger. And the Lacedemonyans all at leasure and pace by pace after the sounde of the trompets. wherof they had greate nomber dispersed into many places of their battaille, for suche was their custome and ordenance, to cary many of them, not for any relygyon or deuotyon as many other doo, but for to marche in better order at the sounde of the sayd trompettes, and also to the ende that they shulde not be putt into disorder at the encountrynge of the ennemyes, as it chauncethe oftentymes whan twoo greate armyes do encounter the one, the othere. But before that they dyd come to the encountrynge or metinge, Agis kynge of the Lacedemonyans deuysedde wyth hymselfe for to do a thynge for to empesche and wythstande that, whyche hadde alwayes bene vsed whan twoo battailles dyd encounter. For those, that be in the righte poyncte of ayther syde, whan they comme to encounter the ennemyes that be in the apposytte or directly agaynst the lefte poyncte, they spreade themself in lenghe for to enuyrone and enclose thē. For that, that ayther partie fearinge to abyde in discouert of the ryght syde, whych the shield doth not couer, he wardeth hymself wyth hys shielde that is nexte hym on the right hande, and they thinke that whan they be most locked togiders, they shulde be moste in couert and in suertie, and he that is formost in the ende of that same ryght poynct, sheweth to the other the way to do yt, for insomuch as he hath none at his right hande for to warde hym, he taketh the moste payne that he maye, to exchue the ennemyes on that syde that is openne or discouered, and for that cause doth the beste that he canne for to auaunce the ende of the contrarye poyncte, that was opposit or dyrecte againste hym and for to enclose and enuyronne it, for that he woolde not be assailled on the syde, whyche ys discoueredde, and the othere for the selfe feare dyd followe hym. Nowe the Mantynians, who kepte the ryghte poynct of their syde, were in much greater nōber, than the Scirites. Also the Lacedemonyans and the Tegetes, who kepte the ryghte poyncte of their syde, were in muche greater nōber, than the Athenyans that kepte the lefte poynct of theirs. For thys cause Agis fearyng leste the lefte poincte of his people shulde susteigne dammage by the Mantynyans, who were in muche greater nomber, he made a signe to the Scirites and to the Brasidians, that they shulde retyre oute of their order, and ioigne themselfe to the Mantynians, and fourthwyth he commaunded two Trybuns, that were in the ryghte poyncte, to wytte, Hipponoides and Aristocles,
                     Hipponoides.
                     Aristocles.
                   that they shulde departe oute of the place, wherein they were in theire bendes, and that they shuld readely bestow thēself in rome of the said Scirites & Brasidians, thynkinge that by that meane, hys ryghte poyncte shulde remayne yet well prouyded for, and the lefte shulde be greatly strengthened for to resiste the Mantynyans. Neuertheles they woolde not do it, aswell for that, that they were already nighe hande to hande wyth the ennemyes, as also the tyme was very shorte for to do that, whyche they were commaundedde, through occasyon wherof, they were afterwardes bannyshed oute of Sparte, as nyce and slouthfull. The Scirites and the Brasidians beinge than separated and retyred out of their order accordinge to the commaundemente of the kyng Agis, and the same kyng, seing that the other two bedes dyd not come into their place, he comaūded them againe, that they shulde putt themself into their former order. But it was not possyble for them so to do, nother for those of that poynct, fromwhence they were departed, to receue them, beinge alredy all locked togider and nigh vnto the ennemyes. And yet neuerthelas the Lacedemonyans shewedde themselfe in all thynges the better warryours, and more experimented in warre, than the other.

For whan it came to fighting hande to hande, the Mantynyans, that hadde the ryght poincte, at the arryuall dyd put the Scirites and the Brasidians to flight, and wyth their allyes and the thousande souldiars of the Argiues, they charged vpon the lefte poincte of the Lacedemonyans, whych they founde naked & voide wt the sayd two bendes, and so repoulsed it and constraigned the Lacedemonyans, that were after them there, to take flight, and chased them into the maresses that were nyghe vnto them, wherein there were some of the mooste aged slayne. And so in that parte, the Lacedemonians were vainquished: but as for the remenante and chiefly the middell of the battaill, wherin the kinge Agis was, hauing aboute him three houndred chosen men, whyche were named, the knightes: the thynges wente whooly otherwyse, for they chargedde wyth suche foorce vpon the pryncipall and mooste auncyent of the Argiues and vpon the thousand souldears, whyche were named the fyue Cohertes or bendes, and lykewyse vpon the Cleontyns, and vpon the Orneates, and vpō some Athenyans, that were in their bendes: that they caused them to lose the place, and trulye manye wythoute makyng
                     •
                   resystence, seynge the ympetuosytye or fiercenes of the Lacedemonyans, dyd flye, whereby a nomber of them were oppressed and strangled in the prease. The Argiues and their allyes beinge in flyght, their battaille was brokenne on bothe sydes, whereby the Athenyans, that were in the lefte poynct were in great daunger. For that, that the Lacedemonyans and the Tegeates, whyche were in the ryghte poyncte of the ennemyes, had enclosed them on the one syde, and on the other, their allyes were vainquished, and had not it bene for the succour, whiche they had wt their horsemen, they had bene all destroyed. And also in thies enterfaictes, Agis beinge aduertysed, that those, that were in the lefte poyncte of his battaille dyrectly agaynste the Mantynyans, and the thousand souldears Argyues, were in greate parille: he commaunded all his people that they shuld go to succour them, which thing they dyd, by meane wherof, the Athenians had leasure to saue themself with the Argiues, which had bene vainquished. And as touchinge the Mantynyans and the thousand sonldyars of the Argiues, they hadde no hart any lōger to poursue against them, that were opposit or directly against them, but yet seinge their people beaten or ouercomme, and the Lacedemonyans that came to ouerronne them, they dyd lykewise flye, and therin many of ye Mantynyans were slayne: but the more parte of the thousande souldyars, Argiues, saued themselfe in retyringe all fayer and easely wythout flying in disaraye. For also the customme of the Lacedemonyans ys to fight a
                     •
                  grelye and longe vntill they haue putt their ennemyes to flyghte, but afterwardes, as they see them flye, they follow not them longe. And suche was ye yssue of that same battayl, the whiche was the greateste and mooste sharpe amonge alle the othere that the Grekes had hadde togider, for also the same was betwene the mooste puissance Cyties of Grece. After the victorie, the Lacedemonyans, spoilled furst ye dead bodies of the ennemyes of their harnes, wherwt they dressedde their Trophee, and than they spoilled them of their habillemētes and apparell which they caryed away, and that done they rendred the Cariogns to the ennemyes, that requyred them. As touching theirs, they caused them to be caryed into the towne of Tegea, and there they caused them to be honnorably engraued or buryedde. The nomber of them that dyed in that battaille, was, of the Argiues, Orneates, and Cleonyans aboutes leuene houndred, of the Mantynyans two houndred, and of the Athenyans and Argyues asmany: amongeste whome, were Dukes and Capytaines of the same Athenyans and Argiues. On the Lacedemonyans parte, there was not so many, as there nedeth any greate memory of them, and also the nomber is

not well knowen but it is comonly sayde, that there dyed of them aboutes thre houndred. Nowe was it happened, that at the houre, whan the battaille shulde be made, Plistoanax the other kynge of Lacedemony yssued wythe the olde and yonge people of the Cytie,Plistoanax. for to comme to the succours of the othere. But being comme to Tegea, and there vnderstandinge the newes of the victorye, he retourned, and so contremanded or wylled the Corinthians and othere allyes, that be out of the distraict of Peloponese, whyche came lykewyse to the succoures of the sayde Lacedemonyans to repaire homewardes, and geuyng lycence to certayne estrangers, that were wyth them to departe, they afterwarde celebrated theire feast, which is named, Carnea. And by this meane they reuenged and blotted out the infamie and shame, which they had receyued of the Athenyans, aiwelle in the Island, as in other places, (wherby they were reputed nyce people and euil warriours) through this only victory, and yt was knowē that that, which bifore tyme had happened vnto them, was through fortune of warre, but that their vertue and force therin was such, as had bene accustomed. It chaunsed also that the day bifore the sayd battaille, the Epidaurians, thinking that the Argiues had bene al gone to that same battaill, & by that meane, that the Cytie remayned voide or desolate, they came with al their strength or power for to enter into their land, and did slay some of their cytezeins, that were left for defence of the cytie, whych came fourth against them. But thre thousand Elyans which did come to ye succour of Mantynyans, and a thousand Athenyans, which lykewyse came to ye succour of theirs, togiders wyth those that were eskaped from the battaille, ioigned themself togider, and went all agaynst Epidaure. And in ye meane tyme, that the Lacedemonyans made their feaste of Carnea, they assieged the sayde cytie on all sydes, departynge the quartiers amonge them, and they enclosed yt wyth walles. And the Athenyans in the quarter that was geuene or appoyncted to them, after that the other dyd ceasse to worke, they fortefyed the temple of Iuno, whyche was wythout the cytie in their sayd quarter, and therin placinge a good garnysonne they afterwardes retournedde fromethence into theire houses. And so the sommer endedde.
            
            
               ¶How the peace was made bitwene the Lacedemonyans and the Argiues, and afterwardes the allyance. And of some other thinges that were done aswell on the parte of the Lacedemonyans, as of the same of the Athenyans wythout anny declaration of warre. ☞The .x. Chapter.
               IN the begynnyge of the wynter followynge, the Lacedemonyans, hauinge celebrated their feaste of Carnea, the yssued into the feldes and wente towardes Tegea. Being in which place, they sente of their oune mynde their messengers vnto the Argyues for to treate the appoinctmente. Nowe there was in the cytie of Argos many (that were the chiefest) with the Lacedemonyans, the whyche furthere desyred to abolishe the estate and gouernance of the common people, whyche was in the cytie, and to bringe it vnto a small nomber. And after the battaille loste, founde manye of the people of theire opynyon. And for to do that, they wolde furste make peace wyth the Lacedemonyans, and that done, afterwardes make the allyance, by meanes whereof they hoped to subdewe the people. The Lacedemonyans dydde than se

But fynally, they that toke parte wyth the Lacedemonyans, had furste so declared their myndes and vsed suche diligence, that they induced the comon people to make and accepte the sayde peace, in manner that followeth.
               
                  The fourme of the peace bitwene the Lacedemonyans and the Argiues.
                  IT pleaseth the counsaill of the Lacedemonyans to make peace with the Argiues in this manner. to wytt, that the Argyues shall render to the Orchomenyans,Orchomenu. their childrene, to the Menaliens their Cytezeins: and those that were wythin Mantinea, to the Lacedemoniās. And further, that they shulde wythdrawe their people, whiche they hadde bifore Epidaure, and rase downe the walle, whyche they hadde there made. And if the Athenyans wolde not wythdrawe theirs fromthence, they shulde be reputed enemyes, aswell of the Lacedemonyans, as of the Argiues. And likewyse the Lacedemonyans, if they had any childe of the sayd Argiues or of theire allyes wyth them, they shulde render and delyuer them. For perfourmance of whyche thinges, they shulde make othe the one to the other, and this much is it, as touching them. As concerninge the remenant, that all the cyties of Peloponese small and greate shall fromhensforwardes bein lybertie, and lyue accordinge to their auncyent lawes and customes, and if anny estrangier shall wyll to enter into the said countrey of Peloponese in armure agaynste one of the sayd cyties, the other shal succour yt, so as it shalbe by them aduysed wyth a common accorde. And as touchynge the allyes of the Lacedemonyans that be without the sayde Peloponese, that they be and remayne in the estate, wherin those of the Argyues be, euery one in hys terrytorye, and that whan annye succoure shalbe demaundedde by the allyes of the one of the parties, and that they shalbe assembled for to make it, after that declaration shall haue bene made of the presente articles, it shalbe in their lybertie, aither to fight wyth them, or to retourne into their houses. whych articles were accepted by the Argiues. And that done, the Lacedemonyans departed frō bifore Tegea and retourned home. Sone after, those, that had treated the sayde peace beinge gone and come many tymes, the one vnto the other, it was fynally concluded betwene them, that the Argiues shulde make allyance wyth the Lacedemonyans, forsakinge the same, whyche they had concluded wyth the Athenyans, the Mantynyans and the Elyans, the whyche was accorded in the manner that followeth.
               
               
                  The fourme of the allyaunce betwene the Lacedemonyans and the Argyues.
                  IT hathe pleased the Lacedemonyans and the Argyues for to make allyaunce and confederation betwene them, for fyftye yeares in thys manner. To wit, that the one partie shall do and mynyster ryghte and reasone vnto the other egally accordinge to their ancyente lawes and customes. And that the cyties that be in Peloponese, free and lyuing in lybertie, shal & maye enter into thys allyance, to holde theire terrytorye and to exercyse theire iustyce, lyke as they haue accustomedde. And all the othere Cyties, that be

allyed wyth the Lacedemonyans, beinge wythout Peloponese, shalbe of the self sorte and condytion, that the Lacedemonyans be in: and likewyse the allyes of the Argyues of the sorte and condytion of the same Argiues
                        •
                     kepynge their terrytory. And if it be nedefull to sende anny succours to anny of the sayde confederated cyties, the said Lacedemonyans & Argyues shal mutuelly deuyse, what shal be expedient and raisonable, to wit, if any of the sayd cyties haue question & difference wt other cyties, that they may not be of this alliance, by reasone of their lymitts or otherwise. And if any of the same confederated cyties, had any difference the one against the other, the same different shalbe cōmit to one of the othere cyties, that shalbe foūde trusty and indifferent vnto both parties
                        •
                     for to be frendly iudged after their lawes and customs. In such fourme was the allyance made. By meane wherof all the differents that were bitwene the sayd two cyties were extinguished and appeased. And so they concluded bitwene them not to receyue any herault nother any Ambassadour of the Athenyans, into nother cytie, but ye furst they shuld voyde their people out frō Peloponese, and rase downe ye walls, that they had made at Epidaure, and that they shulde promys, nothere to make peace, nor warre, but by one common accord of both the sayd cyties. Nowe the sayd Lacedemonyans and Argyues had purposed to do many thyngs, but principally they were wyllynge to make an enterpryse into the countreye of Thrace. For that cause they sente their Ambassadours vnto Perdiccas for to wtdraw him to their allyance. whereunto he wold not at the furst fronte agree nother departe from the amytie of the Athenyans, notwythstanding that he had greate regarde to the Argyues, for that, that he was borne in their cytie, and therfore he did take a tyme for to deliberate & consult vpon it. And therupon the Lacedemonyans & Argiues renewed the othe that they had wt the Chalcides and also added anew othe.Chalcidenses. Afterwards the Argiues did sent their Ambassadours to the Athenyās, for to sommone and commande them to forsake and rase downe the wall that they had made at Epidaure. Who parceyuinge that the armye, whyche they had lefte there was small, in comparyson of the othere, that was departed fromethence: they sente Demosthenes,Demosthenes for to cause their people to retyre. who beinge there arryued, faygned to make a tourney wythout the towne, and by that meane caused the other that were in garnyson wythin, to issue fourth, and whan they were with out, he locked the gates agaynst them, and afterwards caused them of the towne to assemble togider, and renewed the allyance, whyche they had wyth the Athenyans, and in that doinge, rendred the wall vnto them for whyche the question was. After that the allyance was made betwene the Lacedemonyans and the Argiues, the Mantynyans refused at the begynnynge to enter into it: but seynge that they were to weake for the Argiues, sone after they made appoynetemente wyth the Lacedemonyans, and lefte the townes that they helde in their lybertie. That done, the Lacedemonyans and the Argyues, ayther of them sente a thousande of their people to Sycione, and there dydde take the gouernance frome the common people, and committed it into the handes of a certen nomber of the cytezeins, and the Lacedemonyans were principall and chief doers thereof. And sone after the lyke was done in the cytie of Argos to the intent, that it shulde be gouerned after the selfe order vsed in the cytie of Lacedemonie. whyche thinges were done aboute the ende of the wynter, the sprynge tyme approchyng, in that same yeare, whyche was the

meane tyme the people of Argos, who had already conspyredde to recouer and take agayne the gouernement, espying the tyme whan the Lacedemonyans exercysed themself all naked accordinge to their custome: they arose vppe againste their gouernours in armure, and some of them they dyd slay, and the other they bannished, who, bifore that they were chased or dryuen fromthence, had sent vnto the Lacedemonyans, to haue theire ayde, but they slacked tomuch their cōming through cause of their sayde excercise or playes, notwythstandinge they sone after deferred or put them of, and issued fourth into the feldes for to succour the said gouernours. But beinge arryued at Tegea, and vnderstandinge there that the said gouernours were driuen away, they retourned frōthence & acheued or made an ende of their said playes. Afterwardes ambassadours were sent vnto them, aswell by those, that were chased fromthence, as also by those, that gouernedde the towne, the which were hearde by ye Lacedemoniās in the presence of their allyes. And after that the thinges were at lengthe debated, it was declared, that the gouernours were wronfully and wtout cause bannished, and was concluded to go thider in armure, and by force to place thē agayne wythin the towne, but the execution beinge to longe delayed, they, that were wythin the towne, fearynge to be ouercomme and takene, reallied themself afreshe wyth the Athenyans. thinking to be by them garded and defended: and that done, they caused soubdainelye the walls to be made from the towne vnto the sea, to the ende that if they were empesched or lett to haue victuails by lande, they might yet haue them by sea, andthys they dyd (hauinge intelligence wyth some of the Cyties of Peloponese) in so great diligence, that there was not man nor woman, yonge nor olde, small nor great, that imploied not himself therin. Also the Athenyans sente thider all their masons & carpenters, so yt the said walls, were acheued and fynished at the ende of sommer. Whych parceued, the Lacedemonyans assembled all their allyes, except ye Corinthians, and in the beginning of wynter they wente to make warre against them vnder conducte of their king Agis. And they had also some intellygence in the towne of Argos, but seinge that it came not to effecte, they toke the walles, whyche were newely made and not fully fynished, by force, and rasedde them downe. And afterwardes they dyd take a small towne, that was in the terrytorye of the sayde Argos, named Hysias, by assault, and dyd slaye all the notable or beste men that they founde wythin it, and afterwardes retourned fromethence into their houses. And sone after the Argyues yssued fourth of their town wyth all their force agaynste the Phliasians, & pillagedde alle their lande, for somuche as they hadde receyuedde their exiles or bannyshedde men: of whome some had there, houses and heredytamentes, and afterwardes retourned fromthence into their towne. That same wynter, the Athenyans made warre against Perdiccas in Macedonie, vnder colour of thys, that they sayde, that he had conspired against them wt the Lacedemonyans and the Argiues, and that whan the same Athenyās had prepared their army for to sende them into Thrace against the Chalcydes and the Amphipolites vnder the conducte of Nyrias, he hadde dissembled wyth them, in suche sorte, that the sayde enterpryse coulde not be executed, and by that meane he was declared their enemy. And in thies entrefaicts passed that winter, which was the ende of the fourtenth yere of that same warre. At begynnynge of the sommer followynge, Alcibiades wyth twenty shipps passed into Argos, and there beinge entred into the cytie, he toke three houndred of the burgeoses of the towne, whyche he suspected to take the parte wyth the Lacedemonyans, whome he caused to departe and to be caryed into the Islandes whyche the Athenyans gouernedde in that same quarter.
               
            
            
               
               Howe Lytie of Meleas was as sieged and fynally taken by the Athenyans, and some other thynges that were done that self same yeare. ☞The .xi. Chapte.
               IN that same tyme the Athenyans also sente an othere armye by sea wt thirty shyppes of theirs agaynste the Islande of Meleas, in whych shippes there were twelue houndredde men well armed, three houndredde Archers and twentye lyghte horses, and moreouer there was in that same armye, sixe shippes of those of Chio, and two of those of Lesbos, besydes the ayde whyche they hadde of their othere allyes, and of those of the selfe Islande, whyche amountedde to, aboutes a thousande, fyue houndredde men. Nowe were the Meliens Burgeoses of the Lacedemonyans, and refused to be vnder the obeissaunce of the Athenyans, like as all the othere Isles of that same sea. Notwythstandynge that from the begynnynge they were not so declaredde agaynste them. But for that, that the Athenyans woulde constrayne theym to declare themself and for that cause had burned and wasted that their lande, they shewedde themself openly their ennemys and entred in warre agaynste theym. The sayde armye beynge than arryued in the sayd Islande,Cleomenes. Cleomedes sonne of Lycomedes and Tisias sonne of Tysymachus,Tisyas. who were the Capytains, bifore they dyd any dammaige to them of the Islande, they sente certayn of the Ambassadours vnto them of the citie for to speake with them, who were hearde not bifore all the commons, but before the officers and those of the counsaille onelye. So they declaredde their charge, and were aunswered, and the matter debated betwene them, lyke as herafter followeth in manner of a dyalogue.

The Atheniās, Sithens than it is conuenient so to talke, we wolle not vse doubtful termes, as if that by ryght, the gouernance ouer you bilonged vnto vs, by reasone of the victorye, that we sometyme had against the Medes, nor by long wordes, for to shewe you, that we haue iust cause to moue warre agaynst you, for the iniurye that we haue receyued of you. Also it it not nedeful that ye declare vnto vs that ye be burgeoses of the Lacedemonyans, and that ye haue in nothing offended vs, hopyng by that meane to perswade vs to desist and leue of oure enterprise. But ye muste treate of possible thinges accordingly as we and you vnderstande the affaire and busynes that presently is in hande. And to consider that among people of vnderstanding the iust and reasonable causes be debated by reasone, whan there is no necessitie on the one syde, more than of the other. But whan the more feoble debate matters, which the stronger parte doth demaunde of them: it is conuenient for them to accorde vnto the lesse euyll. The Melyans, Sythence than, that ye wolle, that, without debatynge wyth reasone, men speake, to make the beste, that may be, according to the estate of thynges: It is reasonable, not being hable to do better, that we consarue that, wherein consisteth our comon welth, to wytt, oure lybertie. Also it shulde be conuenient and honorable for a man, that is continuallye in danger, so that he perswade an other, that he shulde contente hymself with that, that he may aduantage and saue by his witt, and by his diligence according to the tyme, and to accepte it lykewyse himself, wherefore you other Athenyans, ought welle to take hede, for this, that forsomuche as ye be of more power, than the other, that if one suche aduersitie chaunced vnto youe, somuche youre ruyne sh
                     •
                  lde be somuche the greater example of other, for your punyshment shulde be somuche the greater. The Athenyans, we feare not the abolyshynge of oure empire and seignorie. For those that haue accustomed to rule other: as the Lacedemonyans haue done, be not so cruell towardes them whome they vainquishe, as they be, that haue bene accustomed to be ruled, whan they rebell, if they haue the victory against them, to whome they were subiect. But as the danger therof resisteth to vs, so leue it to our parelles and fortunes, & lette vs speake of that, which apperteigneth to the augmentacion of oure empire, for whiche cause we become hider, & for the welth of your citie. And as touching that, we woll tell you plainly our intent. Whiche is, that we wolle gouerne you, and yet not be molestuous nor importunate vnto you, and in this doynge saue youe, aswell for youre welth, as for ours. The Melyans, howe may that be, that it shoulde be asmuche our profytt to be your subiectes, as to yours to be our Lordes? The Athenyans. Trulye it is your proffytt, to do rather so, than to suffre all the extremyties of warre. And ours, to haue you to our subiectes, rather than to slaye you. The Melyans: And if we be newter withoute medlynge wyth the one partie or wyth the other, and that we be your frendes in stede of thies questions, being nowe youre ennemyes, wolleye not be therewith contentedde? The Athenyans: No trulye, for it

shulde be more damage to haue you for frendes, than ennemyes, for this, that if we shulde accepte you for frendes, it shulde he a argument or declaration of our weakenes & ympotency, wherby the other, ouer whome we gouerne, shall esteme vs the lesse. The Melyans: Than those, that be vnder youre empire, be of this mynde that they desire that those, whiche haue nothyng to do with you, shulde be your subiectes as they be. And also, that your colonies, if there be any of them that haue rebelled against you, that they shulde be brought againe into your subiection. The Athenyans: And wherefore shoulde they not haue that opinion, for they thinke not, that the one nor the other wythdrawe themself frome our obeysance by any reasone, but only whan they parceue themself to be puissante inough for to resist vs, and that we for feare dare not assaille thē. Whereby, besydes this, that whan we shall haue subdewed you, we shall haue greater nomber of subiectes: Oure empire shalbe also thereby more puissant & more assured, for that, that you be islanders and people of the Islande, and be reputed puissant by sea, wherefore if we subdue youe, ye shalbe afterwardes moste feoble. The Melyans. And you, do not you put and repute youre suertie to be in youre force by sea? but insomuch as you perswade vs, that we shulde leue aparte reason for to obey to your intent and proffitt, we woll lykewise shewe you & take paine to do you to knowe, that the thing whiche we demande for our proffytt, shall redounde to yours, for you may well vnderstande, that by subduing vs without other quarelle, yt shall cause all those of Grece, that haue bene newter, to be your ennemies, for that, that seing what ye shal haue done, they shal feare leste afterwardes, you would do the lyke vnto them, by which doing you augment your ennemyes, & constraine those to be aduersaries, that were not wiliynge vnto it. The Athenians. It is not so, as you do vnderstande it, for we thinke not that those, which lyue in lybertie, be it in maine lande, in any parte that it may be, or in any Islandes, that be not subiect to any other parsone, as you be, may be so sharpe or so to be feared, as the other, that be subiectes & obey by force, whan they be yll mynded: for that, that they, whiche lyue in lybertie be more necligent to defende themself, but those that be subiectes, through their disordered passions, for a smalle occasion, do put oftentymes their estate & ours in danger. The Melyans: If you than, for to encrese your empire, & those, that be in subiection, for to exempt themself out of saruytude, do put your self in so many dangers: truly it shulde be muche more great shame and greater slacknes to vs, that be yet in lybertie, for to suffer it to be loste. The Athenyans. That is otherwyse, and you shall not do wysely if ye followe that counsaille, for your forces be not lyke vnto ours, so that ye shulde not be ashamed to submytte your self vnto vs but insomuche as ye be weaker than we, ye shoulde deuise for your welth. The Melians. It is true, but also we knowe, yt the fortune of warre is most often comon or indifferent, aswell to the weake, as to the strong, & that it standeth not alwayes with the greater nomber. And on the other part, he that rē
                  dreth himself subiect, nother hath hope, nor recouery: wheras he that standeth at defense, hopeth alwaies well. The Atheniās: hope, which is the comfort of them, that be in danger: though yt she bringe damage to thē that vse her, where there is apparance or lykelyhode of recouerye: yet doth she not vtterly destroy thē, as she doth those, that putt all their trust in suche thing, as of his nature is dangerous and full of hazarde, for al at one time she causeth herself to be knowin by thē, that truste to muche in her, and leueth theyme no manner meane to defende theyme. Wherby you, that parceyue youre self so weake and in in suche danger: ought to kepe youre selfe, frome ytt, and not to doo as manye haue done, who hauynge some good meane to saue theymeselfe: whan they parceyue that they be withoute

apparence of hope, retourne to other incertain abusions, as be visions, diuinacions, Oracles and other lyke, whiche by vayne hope, brynge men vnto perdition. The Melyans, we knowe ryght well that, whiche you vnderstande clerely. And that is, that it shalbe a harde thing for to resist your puissance and your fortune, whiche is muche greatter than ours, and that the thynge shall not be egalle, Neuerthelas we trust in fortune and in the grace of God, consideredde that ye haue nother reasone nor good quarell againste vs, and also we hope that if, of our self we be not puissant ynough for to resist, that yet we shall haue succours from the Lacedemonians, wyth whome we haue made allyance, who shalbe constrayned to do it, though that they haue had no other interest, than for their honoure, considered yt we be their burgeoses & parentes, by which reasons ye may knowe that we haue not hitherto bene ouer muche bolde. The Athenyans, we also doubt not the benignitie and goodnes of the goddes, forsomuche as that which we do, and repute to be iust: is not against thopinion of men, and also is according to the deliberation and wyll of the goddes towardes men, and of those men, the one towardes the other. For as touching the goddes, we beleue that, whiche other do comonly bileue of them. As concernyng men, we knowe, that by naturall necessitie, he that hath ouercome an other, remaigneth his lorde. The whiche lawe we haue not made, nother haue we bene the furst that haue vsed ytt. But rather we vse it so, as we haue sene, that other haue vsed yt. and we wolle leaue it perpetuallye vnto them, that shall come after vs. And we be full certaine, that if you and the other had power and facultie to do it, as we haue, that ye would do the like. Wherfore as touchyng you, we feare not, but that we be stronger, than you. As concernyng the Lacedemonyans, we knowe that ye take in good parte the opinion that you haue of them, as people finally experymentedde of euylles, that for their honnoure, they wolle come to succoure you, but neuerthelas we prayse not your follye. For the same Lacedemonians, amonge themself and in thinges that concerne their lawes and domesticall customes, vse oftentymes vertue, But of suche sorte, that if they gouerned with other, men myghte alleage manye examples therof. Notwithstanding for to shewe you the sōmarie: they be the people of all those, of whome we haue knowlage, that moste repute that, whiche pleaseth them, to be honest, and that, whiche is for their proffytt, to be reasonable. Wherefore it shall not be youre commoditie, to rest or trust in their fantasies whiche be without any reasone, in this question, that is of your welth. The Melyans, whatsoeuer you do saye: we do bileue certainly: that although their honour dydde not moue them, yet for their singuler proffytt, they woll not habandone nor forsake this cytie, whiche is their colonie. For by that meane, they shulde be desloyall and vnfaythfull vnto their frendes and allyes of Grece, and shulde procure the proffytt of their ennemyes. The Athenyans, ye presuppose than and cōfesse, that there may be nothyng proffitable, that is not suer: and also that no man shulde enterpryse for his proffytt, if therein were not suertie: but rather for honour, that is to be done, whiche is honnest & reasonable, ye, though that there were danger therin: the which thing the Lacedemonyans do least regarde of al men in the world. The Melians: verely we hope, that they woll take thaduenture and putt themself in hazart for vs. For they haue cause to do it more for vs, that for any other, both for that, that we be nexte neyghbours to Peloponese, and thereby may best ayde themself by vs in their affayres: & for this also, that they may moste trust in vs, for parentage, that we haue with them, beinge discendedde of their cyetzeins. The Athenyans, it is true. But the certaintie of succours consisteth not to be had frome them, that ought to geue it, for the confidence and benyuolence that those

haue in thē, which require it, but it is to be cōsidered if they be the stronger, wherunto the Lacedemoniās haue more regarde, than any other people. For they mistrusting their domestical puissance, cause the succours of their allyes to come for to resist euen their voysins or neyghbours. wherefore it is not to be bileued, that parceiuing vs to be strongest by sea, they woll put themself in aduenture to passe into this Islande. The Meliās: That is true, but they haue other people inough for to sende hider. And the sea of Crete, is so spatious & large, that it is more diffici
                     •
                  e for them that kepe it, to encounter those, that wilcome thider: than for them that come, to kepe themself secrett frō them, and if this reason moueth them not, they haue yet an other meane: to wytt, for to enter into your lande and into that same of your allyes, to wytt those, against whome Brasidas hath not bene. And by that meane they shal geue you occasion to labour to defende your oune lāde, & not to trouble thesame, wherwt ye haue nothing to do. The Atheniās, you make your prouf to your cost, if that you abuse yourself in such thinges, the which you know sufficiētly by other experiences. in y• the Athenyans neuer raised their siege from bifore any place, through feare, but we do well parceiue that whatsoeuer ye haue saide, whiche you were willing to speke for your welth, ye haue not hitherto touched one only word, therof, in al the purposes, which you haue takē. And yet it is the only purpose, whiche the people being in your condi
                     •
                  ion, ought to kepe, and wherunto they ought to trauaile to come: for yt, whiche you propone wt so greate instance, be al thinges to followe, & you haue very short time to defēde or deliuer your self out of the handes of them yt be nowe ready to destroy you, wherfore me thinketh yt you declare your self to be wholy destitute of your wittes, if you cause not vs to withdrawe ourselues without longer debating, & deuise amonge your self some other partie, yt may be better for you, without cōtynuinge in the shame, wherof ye be afraide. For yt hath oftentimes bene cause of great incōuenience vnto them, which theron haue arested in great dangers. And many be founde, that, cō
                  sidering y• thinges wherunto of necessitie they shulde come, if they yelded thēself: haue abhorred the name of seruytude, which they reputed to be dishonest, & haue rather endured the name to be ouercome, whiche they reputed more honorable. Whereby they afterwardes in effect incurred, through their tomuche knowlaige into incurable calamities, and so haue receiued greater shame by their symplenes & folly, than they shuld haue had by fortune, if they wold haue endured it. wherunto if ye be wise, you wol haue regarde. And so ye ought not to repute nor take it for shame to geue place or submyt your self to one so puissant a citie as Athens is, which demandeth but a thing reasonable, to witt, yt you shulde be his allyes in paying him trybute. And sence yt choyse is geuen you, aither to proue ye hazart of warre, or to put your chaunce in suertie: ye ought not by fantasies & contencions to chose the worser. For as it is wisdome (& also comonly it prospereth) not to be willing to geue place or to submytt himself vnto his egalles, whan that a man maye honestly defende him: euene so is it, to relente towardes them that be the strōger, and likewise for the mightier, for to vse humanitie & modestie towardes the weaker. Withdrawe your self therfore aparte without vs, and consider diligently that you consult of the welth, or of the losse of your partie, euen at this instant, & that you haue no longer lesure, and that by the cōclusion yt you shall take therin, you shal make it happy or vnhappy. For this purpose yt Melians did withdrawe themselfe aparte, and after y• they had consulted togider & determyned againe to deny the demande of the Atheniās, they answered in this manner. The Melians. Lordes Athenyans we be of none other opinion than lately we were, and we cannot be willinge to lose in so shorte time: the lybertie whiche we haue kept and enioyed, from seuen houndred yeares hitherto, whiche arne passed sence

our cytie was founded: but rather wyth the fortune, whiche hathe ayded vs vnto this present daye, and with the ayde of our frendes, chiefly the Lacedemonyans, we be determyned for to defende and consarue our cytie, prayinge you neuerthelas to be content, that we may be youre frendes, without beinge ennemyes of the other, & in this manner making treatie with vs, afterwardes to withdrawe you out of our lande. And whan the Melyans had thus spoken, the Athenyans, who had withdrawin themself, from the conferring or comunication, answered them in this manner. The Athenyans, we see well that you alone, through youre opinion and euill counsaille, do holde the thinges to comme, for more certayne than those, which you se bifore you eyis, and you thinke that you see in effect, alreadye, the thinges that lye, in the determynation of other, as though they were in execution, wherby through to muche trustinge in the Lacedemonyans and in fortune and puttinge youre cause in vayne hope: ye shall fall into greater ruyne. In this manner the ambassadours of the Athenyans retourned fromethence into their campe, without hauing concluded any thynge: Whereupon the Dukes and capytaynes parceiuinge that there was no hope to wynne the towne by composition preparedde themself to take it by force. So they departedde themselfe by bendes into the townes borderinge nighe aboute, and enclosedde the cytie wyth a walle, rounde aboutes, and that done, leauinge a good garnisone aswelle of their people of Athenes, as of their allyes and bothe by sea and also by lande: the more parte of the armye retourned fromethence. In that same tyme, the Argiues being entredde into the lande of the Phiasians were circumuented by them of the towne and by the bannyshmedde men of the sayed Argiues, who were in an embuschemente, in suche manner that there were slayne foure skore of their people. And on the other syde, the Athenians, that were within Pylus, made a course bifore the cytie of Lacedemony and caryedde awaye fromethence a good bouttye. And yet for al this the Lacedemonians reputed not the trefues broken, nother would begyn warre, but only they made a decree, by which they permytted, that their people might likewise ouerronne & pillage the lande of the sayd Atheniās. And there was not of al the cyties of Peloponese, one, that made warre against the sayd Athenians, but onely the Corynthians, who made it for their particuler quarelles. The siege than being bifore the cytie of Meleas, they that were within yssuedde fourth in a night vpon them, that kept the siege next to the syde of the markette place, and did take the wall that they had made in that quarter, and slewe a nō
                  ber of them that kept ytt, & moreouer caryed away a good quantitie of corne and of other victuailles into the towne, & afterwardes locked themself againe within without doing any other thing during that sommer, Wherupon the Athenyans were afterwardes more vigilant to kepe better watche in the nyght. And in thies enterfaictes that same somer passed. In the beginning of the wynter followynge the Lacedemonyans, hauing determyned for to enter into the lande of the Argiues, in fauour of the banysshed men, for that they had not the sacrifices propice or fauourable, they retourned to their houses, but that notwithstandynge, some of the Argiues, that attended their coming, were takene vpon suspition by thoder cytezeins, some other of their oune will bannysshed thēself, fearing to be takē. In this season, the Melyans also yssuedde an other tyme, out of the other syde of the cytie, and did lykewise take the walle that the Athenians had made in that same quarter, by meane that there were fewe people for to kepe it, by occasion whereof, the Athenyans sente thider a greater strength: vnder the conduct of Philocrates sonne of Eudemus, who hauing made great preparations for to geue assaulte to the towne, they that were within, by meane of a mutyne and trahisone that was amongest them, yelded themself to the wyll of the Athenyans, who dyd putt to

deathe all the men that they coulde fynde of .xiiii. yeares and vpwardes, and the women and children they dyd take for sklaues, and caryed them awaye vnto Athens. And they left of their people in the towne for to defende it, vntyl they had afterwardes sent fyue houndred housholdes for to inhabitt therein.
            
            Here endeth the fifth booke of the history of Thucydes, and begynneth the syxth.
         
         
            
               Of the Isle of Sycille and by what people yt was inhabited. And howe the Athenyans enterprysed to sende their armye by sea for to conquere it. ☞The first Chapter.
               THat same wynter the Athenyans determyned to sende againe into Sycille
                     •
                   an armye by sea greater than that, whiche Lachetes and Eurymedon had before tyme ledde thider, to the intent to subdewe it, if they coulde, the more parte of theym not knowinge the greatnes of the Isle, nor the multitude of people that inhabited therein, aswell Grekes as strangers, and they enterprysed a newe warre, which was but lyttle lesser, than the same of the Peloponesians. For the same Isle conteigneth in circuyt, somuche, as a great shyppe may saylle in eight dayes. And notwithstanding that it is so great, yet is it not distance frome the firme lande, but twenty stades or thereaboutes. It was inhabyted frome the begynnynge, by many and diuers nations of people, whereof the furst were the Cyclopes,Cycoples. & the Lestrigonyans,Lestrigones. who helde onely one parte of the same, of whome I cannot tell, what nation of people they were, frōwhence they came, nor whider they wente, nother any other thing haue I learnedde therof, but that, whereof the poetes make mention, and euery one of theyme, presupposeth, to haue knowlaige of the same people. After those, the Sycanyans were the chiefe that inhabytedde there, who sayed, that they were the furste inhabitantes and that they were borne in that same lande, but the trouthe sheweth it selfe clerely to the contrarye, that they be Hyberiens, nyghe vnto a ryuer, that is in the sayed countrey, namedde Sycania,Sicani. and beinge chased oute of their oune countrey by the Lyguryans, dyd withdrawe themself into Sycille, whiche they named by their name, Sycania, where as bifore it was named Tinacria,Tinacria. and yett at this present, those of that natiō holde some places of that same Isle in the weste parte therof. Sence after the taking of Troye, certaine Troyans whiche fledde fromethence, for feare of the Grekes, withdrewe themself thider into the quarter of the Sycaniens, wherein makyng their abode, they were all, aswell Troyans as also Syracusians, called Elmyans,Elymy. and did holde two cyties, to wytte Erix and Egesta.
                     Erix.
                     Egesta.
                   Next vnto those, certayne Phocians came to inhabytt there, to wytt, those whiche in their retourne from Troye,Procentes. were by fortune of sea, cast into Lybia, and fromethence, passedde into Sycille. As touching the Sycilians, they came out of Italy: beinge chased fromethence by the Opicians, whiche thinge is verye lykely,

and it is comonly sayd, that they passed in small boates, with the tyde whan they parceiued that it sarued them, for that, that the passage is very short. And that it may be so, there be yet of the Sycilians in Italie, which was so named by a king of Arcadie, that was called Italus.Italus. Thies Sycilians were passed in so greate nō
                  ber, that they vainquished the Sicanians in battaille, & caused thē to retyre into a quarter of the Isle that is towarde the Southe, and therewythall they dydde change ye name of the Isle & called it Sycille, where as bifore tyme it was called Sycania for also they occupyed the greater parte of the good places of thesame Isle: and helde it frō their furst coming vntil that the Grekes came thider which was aboutes three houndred yeares. During which time the Phenycians came for to inhabitt in a certen small countrey of the Isle,Phenices. & in certaine small Islandes nigh therunto, for to trade marchandise wt the Syciliās, but afterwardes many Grekes, being passed by sea into the same, they left their sailling, & lodged thēself with in the Isle, & there foūded three cities in the cōfynes of ye Elymyans, to witt, Motia,Motya. Solois & Panhormus,
                     Solois.
                     Panhormus
                   trusting in the amitie that they had wt the sayed Elymyans, and also in this, that on the same syde there was a very smalle space of the sea for to passe out of the same Isle into Chartage. In this manner and by such nomber of diuers strange people, the said Isle of Sicille was inhabyted. As touching the Grekes, the Chalcides,Chalcidenses. which came from Eubea, vnder the conduct of Theocles,Theocles. were the furst that came to inhabytte here, and founded the cytie of Naxus,Naxus. and without the same they made the chappell of Apollo Archageti, that is yet sene there, into the which, whā they purposed to go out of the Islande, they came furste for to make their vowes and sacrefices there. The yeare after the coming of the sayd Chalcides, Archias Corynthian,Archias that was descēded of Hercules came to inhabyt there, where Siracusa is hauing furst chased frōthence the Sycilians, which helde that parte of the Isle. Nowe was thesame cytie at that time all in mayne lande, without that, that the sea did touche it in any parte, but longe tyme afterwardes, that was added vnto it, that entreth into the sea, and is presently sene enuyroned with a walle, the whiche by succession of tyme was greatlye peopledde. Fyue yeares after that, Theocles and the Chalcydes yssued oute of Naxus, and came to chase awaye the Cycilians that helde the cytie of Leon and dyd take it,Leon. and the lyke dyd in the cytie of Catana,Catana. fromewhence they chased Euarchus,Euarchus. whom, those of the coūtrey named to be founder therof. In that same time Lampis came from Megare,Lāpis. for to inhabytt in Sicille, and lodged himself with the people that he had broughte thider in a ryuer, namedde Pantatius in a place named Trotylum.
                     Pantacius.
                     Trotylum.
                   Afterwardes he came to abyde with the Chalcides in Leon for a short time, and they gouerned the cytie togiders, but being fallen into dissention, they chased him away: & so he came with his people to tarie in Thaspo,Thapsus. where he dyed. And after his death, his men forsoke the place, and vnder the conducte of a kynge of Sycilians, namedde Hyblon,Hyblon. who: by trahyson hadde delyuered the countrey vnto the Grekes, they came to inhabytt in Megara,Megara. and so were, after the kinges name, called, Hyblans: who, two houndred, Forty and fyue yeeres, after that they came thider, were chased fromthence, by a king of the Syracusains, namedde Gelon.Gelon. But bifore that, aboute an houndred yeare after that they came thider, they foundedde the cytye Selinus,Selinus. vnder conducte of Pammillus.Pammillus. Who, beinge chasedde frome Megara: whiche was their Capytall Cytye, wyth the other of hys nation, retyred thider. As touchynge the Cytie of Gela,Gela. it was founded and peopledde by Antiphenus of Rhodes and Eutimus of Crete commonly bitwene theyme bothe,

And therefore shewed the sayd Atheniās, that they shulde do wisely, for to preuent the sayd inconuenience, in good tyme to succour their sayd allyes & to resist the force of the Syracusains. And moreouer did offer to fournishe them with monney for to make the warre. The which declaratiōs being many times made by the Egestians vnto y• people of Athens, it was ordoned to sēde furst ambassadours into Sycille for to lerne, if the Egestians hadde somuche monney as they reaported, & further what preparation they had for warre, and likewise for to enquire of the puissance and condition of the Selenuntins.

Shortly after, the Athenians came thider wt thirtye shippes: wherein were seuen houndred souldiars, & ioigned themself with the Argiues, who yssued out of their cytie, so many of them as coulde were armure, and they al togiders went against Ornee with suche strength, that they did take it in one day, but yet neuerthelas, the night bifore, they, which were within, seing that the siege was farre ynough without the towne, they al saued themselfe.

               ¶The oration of Nycias bifore the people of Athens, for to disswade and breake of, thenterpryse of Sycille. ☞The .iii. Chapter.
               THe presente assemblie hath bene made, for to aduise vpon the manner of sendynge fourth an armye by sea, and howe that it muste be conductedde. But in my opinion, it shulde furste haue bene determyned, whider the same enterpryse ought to be made or not, and men shulde not conclude in a matter of so greate ymportance, at one so soubdayne a consultacion, nother thereupon geue knowlaige to strangers that we woulde begynne warre, for a matter, whiche in no poynet toucheth vs. And albeit that as concernynge my particularytie, I maye acquire honnoure by beynge there, and also I doubte my parsone, as lytle, as anny man of the compaignie: yet haue I alwayes iudgedde hym to be good and a wyse tytezeine, that hathe regarde bothe to hys parsone and also to hys goddes, for that, that he is wyllynge to be of power to sarue in the comon welthe, bothe wyth the one and wyth the other. And therfore lyke as in tyme past, I haue neuer, for couetice of gettynge glorye, spoken otherwyse than so, as I haue knowin to be for the best of the partie: euen so wyll I at this present dothe lyke. And though perswadyng you to kepe that, which is to be kepte, and not to putte in hazarte thynges certayne, for the thynges vncertayne, I knowe welle that it shalle not be throughe thefficacite of my speache, whyche cannot be of so greate substance, as for to moue youre hartes: yet neuerthelas

I wylle shewe you, that this your soubdayne enterpryse is not at this tyme in seasone, and that the thynges that ye enterpryse, be not so easye as they be geuene to be vnderstanded, for it semeth vnto me, that in dooynge this enterpryse, youe leaue in thies parties mannye ennemyes, and also go aboute to cause theyme to comme fromethence hider more largely, for this, that if youe grounde youreselfe vpon the appoynctemente, that youe haue wyth the Lacedemonyans, and that there be annye suertie therein, I aduertyse youe that so longe as we remayne in prosperitie, the name thereof shall endure. But if it myshappene in anny manner vnto oure armye, whiche we sende fourthe, incontynenly they will sette vpon vs, forsomuche as thappoynctemente whiche they haue made wyth vs, hathe bene concluded for feare and to their disaduantage. And on the other parte there be in this matter many doubtfull and ambiguous poyntes, and also there be manye of the contrary parte, which haue not acceptedde it, and suche truly: as be not of the meanest, of whome some b
                     •
                   declaredde, oure ennemyes, the other do not yet sturre, by meane of the trefues of ten dayes whiche they haue, who, if they shalle see our force and strengthe departedde into two (as we be mynded to do it soubdaynely) they wylle fourthwyth be oure ennemyes and ouerronne vs, and also will really themself with the Sycilians, lyke as they haue of longe tyme be wylling to do. Wherfore good aduise ought to be taken herin, and not to repute our cytie to be so puissante, as therby we shoulde put it ayther into danger, nother to couett an newe empire, vntil we shall haue well established the same, whiche we presently haue. And if we be not of power to subdewe the Chalcides in Thrace, our subiectes, tha the rebelled against vs, nor assure our selues of any other in the mayne lande, of whome we be not welle assured: howe wille we so readely go to succour the Egestains, vnder coulour that they be our allyes, nowe being in trouble. Whome (forsomuch as they be of so longe time departed from our allyance) we may pretende to haue iniuryed vs. And though well that, hauynge the victorye against their ennemyes, we shall recouer them, yet shall we not by theyme be greatly ayded, aswel for that, that they be farre from vs, as also for this, that they be many in nomber. Wherfore it semeth to me that it is an folie, for to assaille and assist them there, whome, though we shall haue vaynequished, we nother shalbe hable to defende and kepe as frendes, nother enterteigne in our obeysance. And yf we haue not the victorye, we shalbe in woorse estate than byfore the warre bigonne. On the other parte so farre as I can vnderstāde of the affaires of Sicille, it semeth to me that the Syracusains, although that they obteigne the principalitie in the same countrey: yet be they not hatefull nother hurtful vnto vs. Which is the poyn
                     •
                  t, wherupon the Egestians do grounde themself. And if paraduēture they at this present do come towardes the Lacedemonyans for to gratetie thē, yet notwithstanding it is not to be beleued that they: who, haue an estate for to lose, wille for the quarelle of an other strange empire, enterpryse warre agaynste an other. For this, that they maye welle thynke, that whan the Peloponesians shall haue, through their ayde, destroied and extinguished our estate and empire: they wylle also afterwardes destroy theirs. Moreouer the Grekes, whiche be in that same countrey: be in a maruaylous feare of vs, so longe as we be not there, and yett shalbe in greater, yf that we shalle shewe theyme oure armye in their viewe and afterwardes do withdrawe it. But if we enter into their countrey and receyue there anye shame or damage, they wylle no more esteme vs, but rather wolle ioigne theymeselfe wyth the other Grekes for to comme to assaylle vs in oure countrey. For youe knowe welle, that thynges be somuche in greater admiration of men, as they be further frome theyme, and somuche they haue the

lesser esteminge and reputacion, as they be the more approued and knowin, lyke as may be sene of our selues, for that, that hauing victorye agaynste the Lacedemonyans and the other Peloponesians, where as we were in great feare to resist their power, we nowe already esteme them so litle, that we presume to go to cō
                  quere Sycille, though that they be our ennemyes. Which is not wisely done, for no man ought to extole himself, nor to take tomuche courage for the aduersitie of hys ennemy: but rather refrayning his courage and his glorye to trust in hys puissance. And also ye ought to consyder that the Lacedemonians for the shame, which they haue receiued of vs, do study, no other thing, but how they may cause vs to comytt some folly: by meane wherof they myght reuenge their shame & recouer their honor, & somuche the more, as they be more couetouse of glory and of vertue, than any other people. Lykewyse (Lordes) we ought to consider that this questiō is not here moued for the Egestains, which be strangers and Sycilians, but howe we shall kepe our self from a cytie, whiche for that, that it gouerneth it self by a small nomber of people, is ennemy to ours, that is gouerned by the generaltie. And also we ought to thynke, that we haue a smalle respite for one so great a warre and greuous malady: whiche maye brynge vs into greate sorowe. And if we be encreased with nomber of people and wyth ryches, we shoulde kepe and employe them for ourselues, and not for thies bannysshed men, which repare vnto vs to haue succours, who haue spokenne fayer and haue lyed, to the danger of their neyghbours: consideredde that they do geue vs nothynge but wordes. For if they, through our ayde, haue the victory, they maye (if it seme good vnto them) mocke vs, and euill acknowlaige the saruice that we shall haue done them. And if it chaunce otherwyse, they shall brynge vs with them into ruyne & destruction. And if there
                     •
                  be any one of them, that hath bene by you chosene with their consent for to haue charge of this armye, which parswadeth you, this enterpryse for hys particuler proffytt, & paraduenture, through youth, desyreth to haue this glory, for to be in more estimatiō, and for to shewe a great nomber of horse that he nouryssheth: ye ought not to wylle to satisfie the desyre & prouffytt of one particuler: to the great danger & peril of the cytie, but rather to consider that by suche people: the comon welth is dimynysshed & the particulers be destroyed. And moreouer this matter is so waightie & of so great importāce, that it ought not to be treated and consulted by a yonge man so soubdainly. And for the feare, that I haue, seing many in this assemblie, that do assist him & be come at his request: for this cause I pray & erhorte the most auncient, that they suffer not thē specially to perswade their yonge people, that it shulde be shame for to disswade & breake of the warre, and that it shoulde be imputed vnto them for pusyllanymitie, cowardenes and lacke of couraige, and that it shoulde be an euylle thynge not to haue regarde of his frendes, beinge absent, for the same shoulde chance to them that perswade to make the warre: if that it shoulde take effecte, for that, that ye well knowe, those thynges whiche be done for affeccion happene not oftentymes so welle, as those same doo, whyche be done by good and mere delyberation, wherefore and to theintente that we putt not oure estate in the danger, wherein it lately hath bene, we oughte to aunswere to the Sycilyans, that they abuse not their Empire, concernynge vs, beyonde the lymyttes, whiche it presentlye conteigneth, to wytt not to passe or ercede the goulphe of the sea of Ionia, frome the coaste of the lande, nor of the other coaste, that same goulphe of Sycille, and furthermore that they gouerne their lande and seigniory, amongest themself, as they shall thynke good. And on the other syde, that the Egestians shulde be aunswered, that inasmuche as they haue begonne to warre againste the Selynuntyns wythout vs,

that they also make an ende therof without vs. And for the reste, that we ought not to make newe allyaunces of the sorte, that we haue accustomedde. For we alwayes do ayde the vnhappy and those, which be in necessytie: and whan we require succours and ayde in oure owne affayres, we cannot haue it. And thowe, Threasourer, if thou reputest thy selfe worthy to haue admynistration of the affayres of the cytie, and wilt be a good cytezein: thou oughtest to put this matter agayne into deliberatyon, and to demande the opynions of men therin and oughtest not, nother to haue shame nor feare for to reuoke the lawe and deliberation already made. For there be so many good wytnesses in thys so greate an assemblie, that thou shuldeste not feare to be reprehended for hauinge agayne demanded the opynyons herin, insomuche as it is the medecyne of a cytie euill counsailled. And the manner, of a good offycier for to rule and gouerne well, ys to do for his coūtrey all the beste that he may, or at the leaste to hys knowlaige, not to do ye thinge that may be preiudicial vnto it. Thus spake Nycias, and after him many othere Athenyans dyd speake, wherof the more parte were of opynyon that ye enterprise of the warre shulde be executed, ensuinge the furste deliberation, some were of the contrary opynyone, but aboue all, Alcibiades perswaded the sayd expedytion, aswel for to contrary and inuey agaynste Nycias, whome he hated, as for other reasons, whyche mouedde hym, concernynge the admynistration of the comon welth, and specially for that, the same Nycias had made mention of him in an euill sorte, though that he had not named hym vnto theym by name. But principally for the desire that he had to be chief of that same armye, hopynge by meane therof to subdue furste Sycille, and afterwardes Carthage, and also to acquyre glory and rychesse in that same conqueste, if it chaunced well accordinge to thys expectation. For beyng in greate estymation and fauour of the people, & by hys ambition wyllyng to kepe a greater trayne than hys reuenue myght supporte, he nouryshed horses, whyche was afterwardes, in parte, cause of the euersion of the empire of the Athenyans. For many cytezeins, seing hys superfluytie, aswell in hys fedynge, as also in hys appareille and garmentes, and moreouere hys arrogancye and highnes of his harte in all thynges, that he admynistredde: became hys ennemyes, estemynge that he woolde make hymselfe lorde and tyrant. And although that he conducted the affayres of warre valyantlye, yett for that, that the particulers were the more parte contrary to hys woorkes and particuler enterpryses, they wente aboute to cōmytt the admynistration of the common affayres into the handes of an othere, whereupon did followe the ruyne of the cytie. The same than Alcibiades putte fourth hymselfe and dyd speake to the people of Athens in thys manner.
            
            
               The oration of Alcibiades vnto the Athenyans, for to perswade the enterprise of Sycille. ☞The .iiii. Chapter.
               IT apperteignethe vnto me (lordes Athenyans) to be Emperour and Chief of your armye, more, than vnto any other. And I am constrayned to begynne my talke in thys sorte, for that, that I haue bene therunto prycked by Nycias. And wythout that, it semeth vnto me conuenyent. For the thynges, for the whyche, I am renommed and estemed amongeste men, besydes thys, that they redounde to the glory of my ancesters and to myne: brynge also honnour and welthe vnto the commmon welth. In thys that

the Grekes, whych haue bene at the feastes and solempnites of Olympus, seing the magnificence and sumptuousnes of my facyon of lyuing, estemed therby our cytie to be most puissant, most opulente, and ryche of itself, where as bifore they thought, that they might easely haue subdewedde it. For I was laste at the saide feaste with sixe chariots well appoincted. whiche thing no man hath yet done wt suche a nomber, and also I dyd wynne the firste pryze of the course, the seconde and the fourthe. And moreouere I made the apparaille so sumptuous and soo noble, as apperteigned to such a victorie. All whyche thinges be hon
                     •
                  orable, and that declare vnto the people, the puissance and rychesse of the lande and cytie of hym that maketh them. And albeit that suche woorkes and other lyke, for whiche I am estemed, ingender greate enuye by the other cytezeins agaynste me, yet to the wayfayringe men and estrangers, they shewe a greate argumente of puissance and rychesse. And also me thynketh that the fantasie of him: that goith aboute by suche meanes and at hys expenses, to do honnour, not to hymself only, but also to thys coūtrey: is nother hurtfull nor preiudiciall to the comon welth. And also he ought not to be estemed for euill, that hath suche opynyō of himself, yt he wyl not only be agall to other, but rather wylleth also to excede them by such meanes. For he that ys vnfortunate, fyndeth no man, that therein wylle be hys compaignyon, if than we be dispreasedde of the othere, whan we be vnfortunate: they oughte also to endure and suffre, yf we esteme theym not muche in oure felycitie, and to wayte to doo the lyke, towardes vs, if they thynke good, whanne they shalle be in lyke estate. Neuerthelas I am not ignoraunte that suche people and othere, whyche excelle in anny honnoure and dignytie be greatelye enuiedde. Specyally of theire egalles and matches, and also somewhatte of othere, whiche haue accompaignyedde wythe theyme: but that ys, for the tyme that they be in thys lyfe onely. For aftere theire deceasse, the renomme and prosperytie, that they haue hadde, ys of suche effycacytie to theym that comme aftere, that manye glorefye themselfe to haue bene theire parentes, and specially somme saye, that they be of them, whiche be not, and many other repute themselfe honnouredde to be of the lande, towne and countrey, whereof they haue bene, and for to name them their fellowe Burgeosses & countrey men. And though, for the honnorable thinges that they haue done, I haue attemptedde to imytate and followe suche parsonaiges, and for this cause haue lyuedde more honnorable, than the othere: yet ye see for all that, that I beare myselfe in the affayres of the common welthe no woorse than othere of the Cytezeins. And trulye ye shalle fynde, that the puissance of the Peloponesyans beynge assembledde, I haue wythoute youre greate daungier and expense, constraynedde the Lacedemonyans one daye at Mantynea to putte all theire estate in hazarte wyth one battaille. Wherof though that they hadde the victorie, yet the hazarte was soo greate, that vnto thys presente, they haue not recouered suffycyente audacytie agaynste vs. And thys my yongth and ignorance, whyche semed nothere by reasone nor by nature, to be of power, to resiste the puissance of the Peloponesians: hath caused, and aptly to speake, hath geuene suche opynyon of my audacytie, that at thys presente there oughte noo doubte to be hadde of yt, nother feare that it shulde be dangerous to the partie. but rather so longe, as I shalbe in vigoure and auctorytie wyth this audacytie, the fortune and admynistratiō of Nycias shall seme good and prosperous. And ye maye serue yourself bothe with the one and also the othere, as ye shall thinke good. And for to come to the matter, whereof is questyon, it is not nedeful that ye reuoke youre enterpryse of Sycille, for feare to haue to do with many people. For though that there be many cities in ye same coūtrey, yet they be peopled wt mē
                  
of all soortes. who be easy and accustomedde to change their estate and gouernemente. And there is none that prepareth harnois for hys parsone, nother that maketh 
                     •
                  ortresses in necessary places for defence of the countrey: but euery one, hauynge opynyon to be of power to perswade other to beleue whatsoeuer he wyll say, or if that he cannot perswade them, for to trouble and subuert the estate ayther by practyse, or ells by mōney: prepareth hymself to do yt. Wherfore it is not to be bileued that one suche a tourbe and assemblie of people, woll wyth one will heare what shalbe spokene. The woordes of hym that speakethe be, that they assemble for to conclude anny thynge wyth a comon accorde but euery one prepareth himself to do that, whyche he vnderstandeth aftere his appetyte and wylle, and specyally whan there is anny mutynery or discension amonges theym, as I vnderstande, that there is at thys presente. And also they haue not so many men of warre, as it is reported, for suche thynges be alwayes made more greate thā they be. And verely the other Grekes, beynge hertofore all togider, haue not bene in so greate nomber, as one nation of them bosteth itself onely to be. whych thing hath well appeared in this warre, and that Grece hath bene deceyued by the 
                     •
                  aynynges of poetes, touchinge the nomber of people. For though it hath bene all in armure, yet skarcely coulde it bringe to the campe such nomber of people, as was suffycient. Being than the affayres of Sycille in suche sorte as I saye, like as I haue hearde spokene by many people, the enterpryse shalbe the muche more easy for you, and chiefly for thys, that there be many Barbarous and strangers, who, for the ennymytie, that they haue agaynste the Syracusains woll ioygne themself wyth vs in thys warre: and also we owe not to feare such busynes here, that it empesche vs in that same there, if we woll prouyde reasonably in our case. For it is fully certayne, that our progenytours (hauynge those for enemys, which are named, that they wyll declare themselfe agaynste vs, whan oure armye by sea shalbe in Sycille) and also the Medes: haue neuerthelas acquiredde and gott on thys empire, that we nowe haue, and that by none othere meane, but in beinge puissante by sea, whyche is the onely occasyon, through whyche the Peloponesians haue lost their hope to vainquishe vs, and moreouer if they shal determine for to enter into our lande, they may do it, although that we shall not haue sente thyder thys armye by sea. And also they cannot thereby hurte vs wyth their armye by sea, for that same of ours, whych shall remayne, shalbe yet so puissant as theirs. Wherfore beinge required by oure allyes and frendes to go to their ayde, we cannot shewe them any reasonable cause, wherfore we shulde not do it: and in not doinge it, why they shulde not reproue vs and say, that ayther it is greuous vnto vs to do yt, orells that we haue vnder vayne and fryuolus excuses, refused the ayde, whyche we be bounde to delyuer them by our othe. And also we cannot pretende agaynste them, that they haue not succoured vs in oure warres, for we ayde them not in their countreye, to the intente that they shulde comme to ayde vs in oures, but to the ende that they shulde busye oure ennemyes, whyche be there wyth them in warre, and do them somuche anoyance, that they haue noo power to comme to assaille vs in thies parties. And by suche meane, we and all other, that haue acquyred greate empyres and seigniories, haue encreasedde and maygnteyned them, in geuinge promptely and liberally succours, to them that haue demanded yt of theyme, were they Grekes or Barbarous. For if we refuse to geue ayde to them, that require it of vs, or if we woll debate, to what sort of people we shulde accorde or refuse: in that doynge, we shalle not obteigne greate thinges. And thys, whyche we haue acquired, we shall putt in dangier. Furthermore men ought not to attende to defende theire fortresses, vntill he that is the

stronger comme to assaille them but rather to prepare them in suche sort bifore the chance happene, that he feare to come thider. And also it lyeth not in our free will to appoinct an limit to our Empire, for to say, that one shal passe no further. But rather sithens that we haue yt, it is nedefull to wayte that we be not circū

               The narration of Nycias vnto the Athenyans, meanynge by an indirecte or contrary perswatyon to breake of, the enterpryse of Sycille. ☞The .v. Chapter.
               INsomuche as I parceyue youe all determyned (lordes Athenyans) for to execute this enterpryse: I desire that it maye come to passe accordinge to oure hope. And therfore I wyll shewe yow myne aduise, in that, whiche semeth to me to be done at thys presente. For as farre as I vnderstande, we go agaynste many cyties bothe greate and puissante, the which be not subiected the one to the other, and which desyre not to change their estate and manner of lyuing (for thys is to be done of those, that be in greate seruitude, for to comme to more lybertie and ease and that hope to be delyuered fro subiection) and somuche the lesse, they beinge franke and free, will bicomme oure bondmen and subiects. Amongest the whyche cyties, there be many inhabited by Grekes. Of the whyche, Excepted Naxum and Catana, the whyche I hope wel that they wyl tourne to our syde, for the affynitie, that they haue wyth the Leontins, I parceyue not, that there be many of the other, of whome we maye assure vs. And also there be seuene, whych be well prouyded and fournishedde with all thynges necessarie for warre, asmuche as the armye shalbe, whyche shalbe s
                     •
                  nte thider, and specially Silenus and Saragosse, agaynste the whyche, we pryncypally do go. For besydes thys that they haue there force & strength of warryours and Archers: they haue moreouer greate nomber of shipps, and be all full of maroners and of people for to sarue in them. And also haue great quantytie of gold and syluer, aswell in common in the temples, as in partyculer. And furthere, ouer and aboue thys that they haue in the countrey: I vnderstande that certayn Barbarous or estrangers, be contrybutours vnto the Syracusains. They haue also greate nomber of horses, whyche thynge we haue not, and also they haue greate haboūdance of corne wtout hauing nede to haue therof from other places. Wherfore it is necessary for to sende thider not only nomber of shipps, but also strōge warryours (if ye entende to do there any thyng of importance) for to resiste their horse men, who wyll wythstande and empesche our landynge: and that chiefly, if the cyties of the sayd coūtrey doo for feare of oure army cōspier and confederate theymself togiders agaynste vs. And if we haue no other succours of horse men, than of the Egestains, I knowe not howe that we shall well resiste those horse men, beinge oure ennemyes. And forsomuche as it shulde be greate shame to vs, that our people shulde be constrayned to retourne fromthence, beinge vtterly repoulsed, ayther ells to haue made the enterpryse so slaightly, that after the aryuall it shulde be mete for them to demaunde renforte or newe succours: it shalbe much better to go now thider, so well prouyded & furnyshed, as ye case requireth. and to consyder that we go into a farre countrey, where we muste fyght to oure disaduantage. And also ye passe not through a countreye of subiectes, nothere of people, whome ye haue ayded. And howe than can ye hope to haue ayde or comfort of victuails or of other thyngs as in the land of frendes? But we must passe alwais through contreis & seigniories, and skarcely in four monethes in winter, we maye haue newes of them, nor they of vs. whyche is the reason, wherefore I say, that it behoueth vs to sende greate nomber of people from amonge vs, both of our subiectes and allyes, yea and of the Peloponesyans, if we maye recouer or gett any of them, ayther for practique or for monney, and also a greate nomber

of Archers for to resiste their horsmen, and besydes this, to haue greate haboundance of ships, for to cary victuails & other necessaris, togiders wyth mylners & bakers in so great nomber, that they may always grinde & bake by courses. In such sorte
                     •
                   that in whatsoeuer parte they be in lande, though yt they may not saile they may alwais haue meanes yet to liue. For also we must haue so great nōber of people, that one only Cytie may not be hable to lodge and susteygn them. And in effecte they muste go prouyded of all thinges, in moste plenty that shalbe possible, wythout trustynge to any estranger. And aboue all they muste haue muche monney. For though that the Egestains here do preache, that they haue greate quantytie therof, yet knowe youe, that it is in woordes and not in effecte. And if we departe fromhence, bifore that we be well prouyded, aswell wyth men as wt victuailes, and all other thynges (trusting to that, whych the Eg
                     •
                  stains do saye) we shalbe skarcely puissante for to defende thies here, & to vainquishe the other. Wherfore it is conuenyent that we go thider, prepared as if we wolde builde a cytie in a strange countrey and of ennemyes, and to determyne frome the furste day that we shall enter into the lande of Sycille for to make ourselues maisters therof or if we fayle so to do to holde it for moste certayne to haue the whole coū
                  trey for ennemye. Wherfore, for the feare and knowlaige that I haue of the thinges aboue sayde, and consyderinge that this matter muste well be consulted vpon, and parforce ourselues to be daylly more happy and happy, whych is a thing very harde, beynge men, I wyll (goynge in thys enterpryse, putt the affayre in as lytle hazart that I may, and that to doo, I wyll be prouyded and fournyshed of all thynges necessarye. In suche sorte, that I commyt not the matter to fortune. Whych shalbe a thynge assured for oure cytie, and helthsome for them, that shal haue charge of that enterpryse. And if there be any of an othere opynyon, I remyt vnto hym fromhensfor wardes bothe myne authorytie and my charge.
            
            
               Howe the people of Athenes at the perswation of Alcybiades concluded the enterpryse of Sycille. And howe the armye, after that it was leuied, departed out of the porte of Pireus. ☞The .vi. Chapter.
               NYcias dyd so speake, to the intent, aythere to tourne the people frome that same enterpryse, for the greatenes and difficultie of the matter: or els to go to yt in good suertie, if therunto he were forced: but whatsouer difficultie that he sett afore them, the Athenyans woolde in noo parte lose theire desyre and purpose, whyche they hadde to that nauigation and iourney: but rather were the more heated to set it forwardes, than they were bifore. And so it happened vnto Nycias, the whol cōtrary of that, that he thought. For euery man thought, that he counsailled sagely: and that in doing yt whych he had sayde, the case shulde be well assured. whereby they all had yet greater affection & towardenes to the voiage, than bifore. To witt, the ancyentes, forsomuch as they thought, that ayther they shulde subdue Sycille, or if the worste happened, that they shuld be so puissant, that they could incurre no danger. And ye yong and galliart men, for that, that they desired to go to see the same strange land, assuring themself to retourne and come agayn fromthence in sauluetie. And generally ye meane people & souldiars, for coueteousnes of the soulde or wages, which

they hoped to haue in that same armye: and also continually after the conqueste, for the encrease, which fromthence shuld follow by that meane vnto their Empire. And if there were any, that was of an other opynyon, parceiuing the inclynation of the whole cytie therunto, he durst not say to the contrary, but rather held his peace, fearyng to be iudged to haue coūsailled noughtly. So there was some one of that assemblie, that sayde vnto Nycias with a lowde voyce, that he neded to preche no more therin, but that he ought to declare, what army he iudged

The Athenyans than beyng attentyse & diligent to prepare that, whyche was necessary for ye same enterprise, all the hermes or pictures yt were in the citie were in one night broken by the borders, & the greater parte in the visaige.

And also it was proclaymed euery where that if there were any parson, that had knowlaige of any thing, which had ben comitted against ye religion of gods, he ought to vtter it wtout any fear of whatsoeuer estate he were, were he cytizein or stranger, free or bonde.

Wherunto those, of whom he was hated, dyd wyllyngly geue eare: for that, that they thought, that he empesched them to haue authorytie ouer the people, aud that yf they myghte remoue hym, they myghte easely haue yt. To thys intente they made the thyng more greuous, and did sowe and dyuulge it through the towne, that those faults, which were comytted in sacrefyces, and the breking of ymages, concerned the subuersion of the comon welth. And they foūded their

opynyon agaynste Alcibiades by manye tokens of his facyon of lyuinge, and of the fauour that he had towardes the commons. For the whyche they concluded that the same acte coulde not haue bene done wythout hym. Wherunto he answered to the contrary, offrynge himself to stande to the lawe and for to suffre suche punishmente as appereigned, bifore his departure, if he were founde coulpable. And if he were founde innocent or giltles, he desired to be absolued bifore he proceded in that same voiage, saynge that yt was not reasonable that informations shulde be taken or any processe made in his absence, but rather if he had offended, that he shulde be condempnedde to deathe. For also he sayde that it shulde not be wysely done of theym, to sende a man fourthe with so greate authorytie and puissance, charged wyth one suche a case, bifore that he was purged. But his haters or ennemyes, fearynge leaste if the matter were knowin before hys departure, that those that shulde go wyth hym in ye enterpryse, shuld not beare him fauour, and that the meane people, who was fauorable vnto him, shuld waxe faint towardes hym, forsomuche as through hys cause, the Argiues and some of the Mantynyens were accompaigned to the Athenyans for that same voiage and enterpryse: perswadedde the contrary, and that the accusa

And the same armye lanched fourth and toke sea aboute the myddell of Somer for to saile into Sycille, hauynge many marchantes shippes aswell of theirs as of their allyes, for to transporte victuailes and other preparation of warre, whyche had bene ordened, bifore that they were all ready at the porte of Corcyre, to the intente that all to giders might passe the sea Ionū by the promontory of Lapigea. And those Athenyans and other their allies, which than were at Athens, at the day, that they had takene, were ready in the porte of Pyreus about breake of the day for to embarque them self. wyth whome did issue furth the greater parte of the people, aswell of the cytezeins as of estrangers, some for to accompany their chyldren and their parentes and the other their frendes, all hauynge bothe hope and sorowe. To wyt, hope, that the voiage shulde be proffitable: and sorowe, insomuche as they thought, that they shulde not see agayn a good parte of those, that wente so farre a voiage, and also goinge thider, they shulde leaue those, whiche aboade at home, in manye daungers, and dydde putte and offer theymselfe into many othere, on whyche dangers they than thought much more, than they had done in determinynge the voiage. And yett neuerthelas they conceyuedde suche confydence, by seing one so greate a puissance togiders, that the meane people (yea euene those: that hadde nother frendes nor parentes there) and all the estrangers did comme for to see that spectacle or sight, whyche they esteamed woorthye to be sene, and greater than any man wolde haue thoughte. Also in veray trouthe for an armie of one only cytie it was better appoincted & more sumptuous, than anye othere yt had euer bene sene. For although that the same, whyche Pericles in tymes paste did leade into Epidaure, and thother that Agnon did cōduct into Potidea, were as puissant aswel in nomber of ships, as also of people, forsomuch as in the later there were had foure thousand warriours fotemen and thre houndred horsmen all Athenyans: one houndred galleis of theirs and fyftie, aswell of the Lesbiēs as of those of Chio, besides many other cōpaignyons of their allyes: yet notwithstā
                  ding thappareill & preparation was muche lesser, for that, that the voiage was not so greate as thys. And for that cause, and also that the warre was to endure

longe in Sycille, they had muche the better prouyded and fournished it, aswell wyth people, as wt al other things. Wherunto aswell the Cytie generally, as also the particuler patrones and capytains of the ships did employ themself with all industrie & diligence. For ye cytie did pay a grote a day to euery maroner, of whom, there was a ryght great nomber in so greate quantytie of shippes, to wit foorty longe galleis
                     •
                   which caried their souldyars, and thre skore other that were light. And aboue the said soulde that the cōmons paide, the sayde capytains & patrons did geue an other salary to those that drewe the longest Oares, & also to othere ministres, of their particuler purse. And on the other parte thappareil & preparation aswell of armure
                     •
                   as of enseignes & of accoustrementes was muche moore pompuous and gorgeous than the same of the other had ben. For that, that euery patrone going in so longe a voiage parforced himself to cause, yt his ship shuld be both swiftest & also best and most gorgiously esquipped and trymmed. Also ye souldears that were appoincted for the same voiage toke payne to decke themself aswell wt har

                  ois as wyth other things, euery mā to his vttermost best. And also they were moreouer attentife and couetous of glory, to wit, whiche of them might be preferred bifore the other in order. In such manner that it semed that the same armye was made for an ostentacion and shewe of the puissance of the Athenyans, to the prayse of all the other Grekes, rather than for to fight wt the enemyes against whome they wente

                   For truly, he, that shulde make the estimation and accompte of the expences that were made in that same army, aswell by the cytie generally as by the capytaynes and souldyars in particulere, to witt, of the myses and charges, whyche the cytie had debursed for that preparation and what capytaynes they sente thider, and of that same, whyche the partyculer parsons had made aswel in their harmes, as appareil, and the captains and patrons euery one in hys ship, and of the prouision, which euery man made for to succour himself for a longe tyme ouer and aboue the soulde or wages that he had generally, and further of the great quantytie of marchandyse, the whyche aswelle the souldears did cary for to ayde themself therwith
                     •
                   as also many marchants that followed them for gaignes and winninge: shall fynde that the same armye emporteth the valeur of many talentes of the countrey. The whyche armye dydde bringe into greate admyration, those, agaynste whom they wente, aswelle for the greatnes and sumptuositie of it in all things, as also for the hardynes and audacytie of them that hadde enterprysed it: whiche semed a strange and a maruelous thynge for one onely cytie to haue durst to enterprise one such a thynge: whych for trouth exceaded their porte and force: and specyally being so farre from their housene. Aftere that the souldears and the othere people were embarqued & all the ships charged, sylence was cōmanded wt the voice of a trōpet. And than they made their vowes accordinge to the custome vnto the goddes, not euery shipp aparte, but all togiders by the mouth of the trōpett, and afterwards they dronke in cuppes of golde and of siluer, thone to the other, aswell headds and capytayns, as souldears and maroners. And the lyke vowes did those make, which were on lande, for the army in generall, & particularly euery man for his parent & frende. And after that the instrumentes of the ships and the souldears hadde sownedde and songe their songes to the prayse of ye gods, and acheued and fynished al their mysteries, they launched fourth, and departedde in the beginninge, all togyders rainged or sett in order in fourme of a horne, afterwardes they disseuered themself, euery shipp saylinge accordynge to hys force and swiftnes, & they came furst to aboorde at Egine, and fromthence wente strayght to Corcyre, in whych place the other shipps dyd attende and tary for them.

               IN thies entrefaictes, the Siracusains, albeit that on many sydes they were aduertysed of the army of the Athenyans that came agaynst thē, yet they could not beleue yt. And in many assemblies that were made of the commons for thys matter, diuers and many reasons and opynyons were spokene, aswell by those that bileued the sayde enterpryse, as by thē, whyche byleued it not.

That ys, that the Athenyans, of whome ye maruaylle soo greately and wolle not bileue yt. They comme agaynste youe wyth so greate a puissance aswelle of shyppes as of people, vnder couloure to geue ayde to the Egestains and to their allyes, and to sette the bannyshed Leontyns agayne into theire houses: but in trouthe it is for coue

                     or they thynke wel that if they haue it in their power, they shall easely subdewe the othere. Wherefore yt muste be thoughte on, howe we shall honnorably resiste, wyth the people that we haue at thys presente, agaynste thys greate puissance, whyche wolle not longe slac

And yf there be annye amongeste vs, that estemethe not thys thynge incredyble, but taketh it to be true, I woll not for that, that he haue doubte or feare of the audacytie of the Athenyans, nother of their puissance. For suerlye, they shall receyue asmuche dammaige of vs, as we of theym, yf wee prouyde therefore. And in thys, that they do comme wyth so greate nomber of shyppes and of people, is not for oure disaduantage: but rather it shall redound to our proffit, chiefly wt the other Sycilians, who seing those Athenyans so puissant shalbe the soner on our parte, & rather than on theirs. And also it shalbe our greate glory to haue ouercommed one so greate an armye, yf we can do yt: or at the leaste to haue empesched and brokene their enterpryse, whereof I haue noo doubte, but that yt shall not comme to their passe. And also me thinketh, that we may reasonably hope the one or the othere. For it hath not bene oftene founde,

that an armye by sea, be it of Grekes or of Barbarous or strangers, that wente so farre frome home, prospered well. Also the nōber of people, whych they bringe wyth them

And if those, that comme to assaulte othere, throughe faulte of vyctuailles or of othere necessarye thynges be constraynedde to retourne fromthence, wythoute doynge that, whyche they intended, ye, although that it happene more through their errour, than through the valyantnes of those, whyche came for to assaulte them: yet the glory thereof remayneth alwayes to those assailled. Whiche is the reasone, wher

And we maye hope that the lyke shalle happenne vnto vs. Wherefore, Lordes, hauinge thys firme hope, lette vs vse dylygence for to prepare oureselues to oure power and for to prouyde for all thynges necessarye

And we shulde not onely sende Ambassadours vnto the Sycilians, but also to the other estraungers, whyche inhabytte in Sycille

For vnto them, that be always in feare of their estate, yt ys easye to perswade, that the Athenyans hauynge subdewed vs, maye wythoute difficultie go against their cytie. Wherfore, consideryng that if they neglecte or sette thys thyng at noughte, their estate maye in tyme to come be in daunger: they wolle ayde vs openly or secrettelye, in whatsoeuer manner that yt maye be: whyche thynge they maye doo if they wolle, better than annye people that be thys daye vpon earth, for that that they haue force, power, go

                     de, & siluer, whyche ys the mooste necessarie thinge in all affayres. We ought also to sende to the Lacedemonyans and to the Corynthians to praye theym, that they wylle, bothe to sende succours hythere, and also to moue warre agaynste the Athenyans there in those quarters. And also I wyll tell yowe one thynge whyche semethe to me mooste necessary and conuenyent. That is, that we shulde require all the Sycilians (if youe thynke it good) or at the the leaste the mooste parte of them, that they come wyth all their shyppes victuailledde for two monethes, to ioygne themselues wyth vs to goo to encounter the Athenyans at Torrente or at Lapigea, for to declare vnto them, that it ys not a questyon for them to come so easely into Sycille, but that they muste fyrste passe the Sea Ionum. By whiche doynge, we shall putt theym in greate feare, and into greate thoughte. Forsomuch specially as we shall issue fourth of the lande of oure allyes bifore them for to defende ours, for ye Tarentins woll receue vs into theirs, as frendes. And it shalbe veray harde for those Athenyans, hauynge so longe a sea for to passe to goo wyth so greate an army alwayes in order, and by that meane we may there assaulte theym to oure aduauntage. For some of the shyppes maye not in faste followe the othere. And if they wyll discharge those, whyche be the heuyeste, for to haste theym to ioygne wyth the other, whan we shall assaulte them: of necessytie they muste do yt wythe oares and wythe sayles, and by that manner, that the maronners shalle trauaylle themself beyonde measure. Wherby they shalbe

moste weary, and by consequent the more vnhable to defende themself, if we wol assaulte them. And if we thinke yt not good to be done, we may retyre vnto Tarente. And on the other parte, if they comme wyth a small prouision of victuals, as for to geue onely one battaylle by sea, hopynge afterwardes fourthewyth to gette the lande, they shall haue greate nede thereof whan they shall fynde themselfe to be in desarte places. And if they wool soiourne therein, they shalbe assy
                        •
                     gedde. And if they enforce theymself to passe furthere, they shalbe constraynedde to forsake and leaue one parte of the apparaylle of theire sayde shyppes, and also besydes thys, not beynge assuredde to be receyuedde by the othere Cyties, shalbe in great sorowe. Whyche causethe me to beleue, that if we encountredde theyme and that they parceyuedde that they coulde not lande here as they thought: they woll not departe from Coreyre But rathere in consultynge togider vpon theire affayre, and in sendynge espyes for to knowe what nomber of people and of shippes we haue, and in what place we be, the wynter shalle comme vpon them, whiche shalle aythere breake of and vtterlye lette theire passage: orelles seynge oure preparatyon greatter, than they thoughte, they shalle desyste and leaue of theire enterpryse. And somuche the moore that I am enfourmedde, that the pryncypal of theire Dukes and Capytaynes and that knoweth mooste in warre, commeth hyther agaynste hys opynyon, and therefore wolbe ryghte well contended to retourne fromhence, if we make on our bihalfe anny good occasyon or honnorable moustre. And also the bruyt of that, whyche we wolle doo, shalbe greatter, than the effecte, for that, that in suche case men grounde theire opynyone vpon the bruyte of the people. And whan that he, whyche comethe to assaylle, ys mett by hym that shulde be assailledde, it putteth hym in to more feare, than if the other preparedde onely for to defende hymselfe. Forsomuche as he parceyuethe hymselfe in daungier and studyeth to defende himself, where as he thought, but to assaylle: whyche thynge shall nowe happenne to the Athenyans, whan they shalle see vs comme agaynste them, where they thoughte to comme agaynste vs, and also not to haue founde anny resistence in vs, whyche they had some occasion to thynke, forsomuche, as notwythstandynge that we haue bene allyedde wy

                     h the Lacedemonyans, yet we haue not troubled them by warre. But if they parceyue vs to take couraige, and to do clerely otherwyse, than they imagyned, they shalbe more astonyed for to see one thynge so new
                        •
                      and contrarye to their expectation, than of the power that we for trouth shall than haue. And therefore I pray you Lordes, that ye wyll beleue me herein, what is the beste that ye maye doo. And that is, that ye take couraige to doo that, whyche I haue sayde. And if ye wol not that, yet at the leaste prepare wythout further prolonginge, all thynges, whyche shalbe necessary. And conceyue in youre mynde in that doynge, not for to esteme the ennemye that commeth to assaylle youe: whyche thynge cannot be declared, but by shewynge yt by fayer and notable feates. And those feates be declared, if that fearynge the ennemy, preparatyon were made agaynste hym in suche sorte, that men myghte be in suertye. Takinge this marime or chiefe poincte, that the beste whyche may be done, is to prouyde for thynges bifore the danger, euen as if it were present and sene. For also the ennemyes do truly come wyth a great armye by sea, and be already nygh at aboordinge, and there resteth onely, but this, that they arne not sene. Thus did Hermocrates speke. But yet notwythstanding his sayings, the people abodde in great altercation, for some said that it was not true that the Athenyans came, as Hermocrates said. The other sayd y• although they did come, yet coulde they do no dāmage, but that they shulde re

there were very fewe, that did geue fayth to that: which Hermocrates had spokē, and that had feare of thynges, that were to come. Than Athenagoras, who had greatest auctorytie among the comon people and that coulde best perswade thē in that same tyme, stoode fourth and dyd speake vnto them in this manner.

               WHosoeuer will saye: that the Athenyās be so farre out of their wyttes, as to come assault vs, or that if they do come they shall not falle into our handes,

                  e of them, that sowe thies newes amongest vs for to make vs afrayde, as of their follye, except that they perswade themself not to be perceyued. But it is the facyon of them that haue particulerly any feare in themself, to go aboute to putt it into the comons heades, for to hyde and couer theirs vnder shadowe of the comynaltie. Herunto tende the newes and the bruyte that presently ronne abroade, the whiche be not come rashely: but haue bene maliciously sowedde by those, whiche be customers of the lyke thynges. But if youe be welle aduysed, ye wolle not make any foundation or coniecture vpon the speche of thies people here, but rather ye wylle make coniecture by the qualitie of those, of whome it is spoken, whider they be experymented and sage people, as I do esteme the Athen

                  ans to be. Wherfore knowing them to be such, I thynke yt not credyble, that being not yet delyueredde frome the warre of the Peloponesians, they should habādone their countrey: and come through gayneys & Lustynes of herte to begyn here newe warre, in nothing lesse than the other. But as touching my selfe, I am of opynyon that they owe to repute themselfe happye that we go not to assaulte theym in theyr countrey: so many
                     •
                   and so puissante cyties beynge in this Islande. And admytt that they shall come, as it is reaportedde, yet they ought to thynke that Sycille is more suffycient 
                     •
                  or to beate and destroye them, than the Peloponesians be, forsomuche as they be better prouided of al thinges. And speciallye oure cytie alone ys more puyssante, than all the armye whiche ys reaported to come agaynste vs: yea truly two tymes asmuche, consideredde that they may not brynge hyther any horsemen, and also I beleue that they shall gett none in thies parties, if it be not a certaine smalle nomber: that the Egestayns may delyuer them. And of fotemen they cannot also be in so great nomber as we haue of theym, sithens that they must transporte theyme by sea. For it is ryghte harde and dyfficille that so greate nomber of shyppes, as be necessary for to carye victualles and other necessities for so greate an armye, as is requyred for theym that woll to subdewe and and ouercome, one so puissant a cytie, as ours is, may comme hider in suertie. And I fynde the thynge so farre vnlyke the trouthe, that albeit the Athenyans hadde an Colonie peopled wyth their people, euen so great as this cytie is, in whatsoeuer place here adioigning, and that fromethence they would come to assault vs: yet skarcely they should retourne fromehence without shame and damage. Wherfore with much greater reason it ought to be hoped, cō

                   without thinking to come for to wynne ours. But we haue some people in this cytie, that go reaportyng liberally thinges, whiche nother be in vre, nor neuer shalbe. And this is not the furst tyme that I haue attayncted thē of lyke cases. But many other times I haue founde theym to haue sowed suche newes and also woorse

And I feare greately least they wylle so ostene make suche inuentions, vntyll the matter by some meane shall come to their intente, and that we shall shewe ourselfe so nyce and so slouthfull, that they shall be trappe vs bifore that we may remedy it, and that we haue not the herte to chastise theyme, thoughe that we knowe their euylle wylle. Forsomuche as I parceyue that by suche occasions oure cytie is oftentymes troubledde wyth seditions and mutyneries, whereby ensuych Cyuill battailles, by whyche it hathe bene more often troubledde, then by warre of estrangers, and also hathe bene some tyme subdewedde by certene tyrantes or euylle rulers of thys selfe cytie, but yf ye wolle followe me, I wylle take payne to remedye it, in suche sorte that in oure tyme, we sha
                     •
                  le not nede to feare thys danger. And that aswelle by declarations whiche I wylle make vnto manye amongest youe, as also by punysshynge of the seditious, that ymagyne suche thynges, and not those onely that shalbe conuictedde and attaynctedde thereupon (for it is right difficile for to fynde out suche thynges, but also those that at other tymes haue enterprysedde the lyke, althoughe that they haue not hadde power to execute theyme. For he, that wolle prepare to defende hymself agaynste hys ennemye, oughte not onely to haue regarde to that, whyche hys ennemye doeth: but rather to that, whiche maye be presumedde that he entendeth to doo in tyme comynge. And yf he doo not so, he maye furste receyue damage thereby. And it seemeth vnto me that thies people, that goo aboute to putt the generall estate and gouernemente of thys cytie into the hande of a smalle nomber of men: maye not welle be knowyn frome their euylle wylle: but by dooynge of three thynges, to wytte, by rebukynge and discouerynge in some parte their dedes, partlye in kepynge theym frome executynge of theym, and partly by causynge their enterpryses and wyttes to be vnderstande by coniectures and by reasones. And truely I haue oftentymes musedde wyth myselfe, what thynge it is, whyche youe the other yonge men do intende, to witt, whider yt you nowe presently coueite to haue charges and Empires. For the same is not reasonable by oure lawes, the whiche haue bene made for to empesche and lette that youe maye not haue theyme, not for to doo youe wronge or shame, but onely for the ymbecillitie and weaknes of youre age, for ye maye obteigne theyme, whan youe shalbe of due age. Canne ye not endure to be in the selfe degree that the other cytizeins be in? And howe canne thys be reasonable, that people of one selfe cytye and of one selfe estate shoulde not enioy lyke honnours and prehemynēces? There ys peraduenture some one, that wylle saye: that the common estate canne nother welle nor egallye be counsailledde, and that those, whyche be rychest and moste puissante, be alwayes most sufficiente for to gouerne the estate. To whome I furste answere, that the comon gouernement ys the gouernemente of all the cytie, where the gouernemente of

a small nomber ys but onely of one parte therof. Afterwardes I saye: that for to defende generally: the ryche mē be most mete, but to geue counsaile, those which haue best wyttes and that vnderstande most, be the best: and the comynaltie well assēbled, after that yt hath herde all the opynyons, doth therupon iudge muche better. And all thinges, that be deparred, beit particulerly or vniuersally

                   be egallye departed in the comon estate, where as, whan the smal nomber gouerneth, it departeth the dangers and the charges vnto manye: but of the proffyttes it geueth but a small parte vnto other, but taketh them holy to it selfe. And that is it, whiche those, that be this day the most ryche and most puissant in the cytie (speciallye the yonge people) do couey
                     •
                  t, whiche is a thing impossible in so great a citie. And they, who do desyre it, be aither out of their wyttes, if they vnderstande not that they desyre the destruction of the cytie: aith
                     •
                  r elles be of the most ignorante of all other Grekes, that I haue knowin. And if they do vnderstāde it, they be tomuche vnreasonable for to desyre it. Therefore vnderstandynge yt aither by my speache or of yourselues, vouchsaulf to studye all for that, whiche apperteigneth to the comon welth of the cytie. And to consyder that they among you which be best and the most riche, haue more parte in the comon welth: than the remnante of the comynaltie. And that yf youe goo aboute to accepte the contrary: ye putt yourselfe in danger to be thereof vtterly depryuedde, wherefore ye ought to reiecte and caste oute thies bryngers of false newes, as people alreadye knowin for suche, and not to suffre them to prouffitt to any meanes, by their inuentions. For though the Athenyans shulde comme, yett ys this cytie puissante ynoughe for to repoulse theym. And there be officers sufficiente for to prouyde therefore. And yf the thynge be not trewe (as I do thynke) youre cytie for feare of suche conterfeated newes, wille not purt it self in subiec

In suche manner that it shall not lose his lybertie for the bruyt, which nowe ronneth, but rather shall enforce it self to kepe it, for the good order that it shall geue in thynges to come. Thus did Athenagoras speake. And after hym other would haue spoken. But one of the pryncipall officers and rulers of the cytie woulde not suffer any parsone to speake, but he in briefe woordes concluded the matter, saying in this manner.
               
                  The conclusion of one of the officers of Sarragosse.
                  IT is nother wytt nor wysedome to vse suche pryckyng and oultragious talke, the one agaynste the other, nother for them that speake it, not for those, whiche geue eares to heare it, but rather we shoulde haue more regarde to thies newes yt be comon, to thende for to geue order aswelle generally: as particulerly for to resist those whiche come agaynste vs. And though happely it were not trewe, yet coulde it in nothing noy nor hurt the cytye to prepare it self with horses, with harnnes and with all other thinges that be requysitt for the warre. And for the rest, we other officers wolle vse diligence to prouyde: and also vnderstande the enterpryses of the ennemyes. And further we wolle sende to the other cyties of Sycille and deuise in all other thynges as we shall thynke expediente for this case. And we haue alreadye prouyded therefore, and wolle aduertise you of that, whiche shall herafter come to our knolaige. Upon this conclusion, the counsaille departed.
               
            
            
               
               Howe the armye departed from Corcyre, and howe yt was euylle receyued aswelle in Italye as in Sycille. ☞The .ix. Chapter.
               IN the meane tyme that thies thynges were debated at Sarragosse, the Athenyans and their allyes were all assembled at Corcyre. And bifore their departure fromethence, the Dukes and capytaynes hauyng made their moustre, dyd determyne in what order they would passe the sea, & after that they were landed, howe they would departe their hoast. And so they departed all the sayd army into three partes, of the whiche three, the Dukes shulde haue the conduct, so as shulde happene to euery of them by lotte. And that they did, fearynge that if they shoulde go all togiders, they shoulde not fynde a porte sufficiente for to receyue theym, yea though nother water nor other victuales shulde not fayle thē. And besides this the same bendes, beyng so departed, shulde both make the greater shewe & also shulde be more easye to conducte & gouerne hauing euery one his capitayne a parte. Afterwardes they sente there shyppes, to wytt of euery bende, one, bifore into Sycille & into Italy for to lerne what cyties would receiue them as frendes, & comanded them that they shulde come agyne to mete them by the waye to make them answere what they had declared vnto them that they would do. After that all the same was so done and ordeyned, the Athenyans with that great preparation departed for Corcire, and toke the way towardes Sycille, hauyng in all one houndredde thirty and foure galleys wyth three oares, and two Rhodiens wyth twoo oares. Of the whyche with three oares, there were one houndred of Athens, wherof three skoore were light galleys, & the other caryed the men of armes. Those of Chio, and the other allyes of the sayd Athenyans did fournishe the rest of the shyppes. As touchyng the nomber of people, that were in the sayd army, there were in ye hole some fyue thowsande & one houndred fotemen, wherof fyftene houndred were Athenyans, who had seuen hoūdred seruantes for the nauigation or sayling & of other, aswel allyes, as subiectes, & speciallye of the Argiues fyue houndred, of the Mantynyans, and other Mercenaries or huyred souldiers two houndred and fyftie, and of archers in all foure houndred and foure skore, whereof the foure houndred, were Rhodyens & the foure skore of Creta. There were also sixe thousande men lyght armed, of Megara, and thirty horsemen, vpon a barke, for to carie horses. Such was the Athenyans armye by sea at the begynnynge. And besydes thys there were thyrtye marchandes shyppes caryinge vituailes and other thynges necessarye for the sayedde armye, besydes a greate nomber of other, of dyuers sortes, whiche followedde the sayedde armye for feate of marchandise, whyche were at Corcyre, and all togiders passedde the goulphe of the sea Ionium. But afterwardes, they departedde theymeselues and aboorded one partie at the promontorye of Lapigea, one other partie at Tarente, and the other in dyuers places in Italye, so as they perceyuedde the landynge propice, and mete for them. But yet neuerthelas they dydde not fynde any cytie, that woulde receyue theym for marchandise nor otherwyse, but rather dydde onely permytt them to lande for to refresh themself wt water and with other thinges, excepted the Tarentyns and the Locryans, who suffredde them not to make any descente in their lande. In such manner they passedde wythoute restynge themself vntyll they came to aboorde at the promontorye of Rhegium in the extremitie of Italye. In whiche place beynge refufedde to lande, and beynge alreadye strongelye assembledde, they

lodged themselfe without the towne, nyghe vnto the temple of Diana, and thider they of the sayed towne sente vnto them victuailes and other necessaries for their monney. And there hauynge brought theyr shyppes into the porte: they for a certene tyme soiourned, and in the meane tyme spake vnto the Rhegyns perswadynge theyme that they woulde ayde the Leontyns, consyderedde that they were Chalcydes, lyke as they were. Who aunswered that they woulde not meddle wyth the warre of the Sycilians, but they woulde earnestly do in al thinges as the other Italyans comonly woulde do. Notwythstandyng the whiche aunswere, the Athenyans, desyrynge to execute their enterpryse of Sycille, attended the aunswere of the shyppes
                     •
                   whiche they had sent to Egestes, for to vnderstand the affaires of the sayd countrey: and chiefly touchynge the monney, whyche the ambassadours Egestayns had vaunted and bragged of to the Athenyans, that shoulde be founde in their Cytie, whider it were for trouthe or not. In thies enterfaictes the Syracusains had newes frome many quarters, and pryncypallye by the Brygantins (whiche they hadde sente for to espye and discouer) howe the armye of the Athenyans was arryued at Rhege.Rhegiū. So they were no more harde of bileue, but rather vsed all diligence that they coulde, for to make al preparations for to defende them, & sent vnto all the other Sycilians, to some ambassadours, and to other, people, for to defende and kepe theyme. And moreouer they withdrewe into their tycie all the shyppes, that they myght, frome all coastes for defence thereof, and made monstre of their people, and a description of their harnnes and of their victuaile, whiche they hadde in the cytie. And for effecte prepared all other thynges that was possible for theym, euene so, as yf the warre had bene alreadye bigonne. In this meane tyme, the three shyppes, whiche they had sente to Egeste, came agayne to them to Rhege, who made reaporte vnto them: that there was none other monney in the sayed cytie of Egeste, than the same, whiche they hadde promysedde, whiche myght amounte to the some of thyrty talentes onely, wherewyth the Dukes Athenyans were all astonyedde and discouraiged, seing that at the Aryuall the pryncipalle dydde faile them, whereupon they were foundedde, and that Rhegians refusedde to enter into the warre wyth them. Who were the furst that they had aboorded, and those, whome they myght hope sonnest to wynne, aswelle for that, that they alwayes hadde bene parentes of the Leontyns and of one selfe nation, as also for that, that they were alwayes affectyonedde to the partie of the Athenyans. Whereby Nycyas was in nothyng abused. For he had neuer other opynyon of the Egestayns, but that they woulde abuse the Athenyans, but the other two capytaynes founde theymselues deceyued, who had been abusedde by the cautell and crafte that the Egestayns hadde vsed, whan the furst ambassadours of the Athenians was sent vnto them for to see their treasuer. For after that the sayed ambassadours were landed and come into their cytie, they brought them into the temple of Uenus, whiche is in Eryce. and there shewed them basyns, the censars and other hallowedde vesselles that were in the sayedde temple: togiders wyth the offerynges, vowes and other moueable riches, whiche were of greate valeur. And for that they were of iyluer, they made a great monster and apparance, that there had bene a great some of monney in that same cytie insomuche as beinge so smalle: there was somuche in that same temple. And besydes this in diuers houses, where the Athenyās that came in that ambassade were lodged, and vpon their shyppes, their hoastes shewedde them greate quantitie of vesselles of golde and of syluer, aswell for saruice at the table, as for the kytchyne, whyche they hadde for the moste parte borowedde of their neighbors, aswell of the self countrey, as of the Phenicians & of the Grekes

faignynge, that it all was there oune
                     •
                   and that it was their manner of lyuynge. Whereupon, the sayd Athenyans perceyuing so great quantitie of vessell and so ryche in all their houses, and as all of one sorte, were all astonyed. And after that they were retournedde to Athenes, made reaporte that they hadde sene a meruelouse quantitie of golde and syluer. And by that meane the Athenyans were abused, whereby, after that the men of warre, that were at Rhege vnderstoode the trouthe to be contrarye by the messengers that they had sent thider, they became hatefull and seditious agaynst them. And thereupon the Dukes consulted togyders of the affaire. And the opynyon of Nycyas was that they altogider shoulde go fromethence to Selynunte. To whiche place it was pryncipally ordeynedde that they shulde go in fauour of the Egestayns. And if being there the Egestains made whole paymente of all the armye, that they myght consult what they had to do. And if they made not the sayd payment, that than it shulde be demaunded of them, that at the least they shoulde victuale the three skoore shyppes whiche they had required for their succours. And in that doyng that men shoulde abyde there vntill that they had reconcyled the sayd Selynuntyns with those Egestayns aither by frendeshyp or by force. And after that, yt they shulde passe through bifore thother cyties of Sycille for to shewe the puissance of the Athenyans, and also to geue courage and hope to their frendes, and that done to retourne fromthence all into their houses wythoute otherwyse to soiourne in that same quarter except that in short tyme or by some oportunitie and occasion, they myghte doo some aduantage and saruice to the Leontyns, and withdrawe any of the other cyties to the allyance of the sayd Athenyans. For it semed vnto him that doing othewise, they shoulde putt the estate of Athens in danger by that expences onely. But Alcibiades was of contrary opynyon, saying that it shulde be tomuch great shame, to be come with one so great a puissance into a countrey so farre of, and to retourne fromthence without doing any thinge there. Wherfore he was of aduyse that heraultes and trompettes shoulde be sent vnto all the cyties of the countrey except Sarrogosse & Selynunte, for to aduertise thē of their comyng, and to essaye for to wynne theym, to wytte, for to cause the subiectes of the sayed Syracusains and Selynuntyns to rebelle agaynst them and to withdrawe the other vnto the allyance of the Athenians. And by that meane to haue victuailes and people of theyme, and bifore all the other they shulde essay to gette the Mamertyns, for that that they were moste nighe to the ryght landynge for to come out of Grece, and also there was a great porte and ryght suer, wherunto the said Athenyans myght wichdrawe themselfe and retyre in suertie: and fromethence practise wyth the other cyties. And after that it shulde be learned what they were that would be ernest against the said Syracusains, and those, that would be to the contrary: to go agaynst the Syracusains and against the Selynūtyns for to constrayne them, at the least, to wytt, the Syracusains, to apppoyncte with the Egestayns, and the Selynuntyns, that they shulde permytt the Leontyns to abyde in their cytie and houses. As touchynge Lamachus his opynyon was that men shulde go as sone as they myght agaynst Sarragosse and assault them being vnprouyded, bifore that they myghte prepare, for to resiste, and whilest, that they were astonyed, lyke as wythout fayle, they woulde haue bene at the begynnynge, for that, that an armye is alwayes fearefull
                     •
                   at the aryuall. But if it delayeth to go to assault his ennemyes, they consulte, vpon their affaire, and in so doinge doo recouer their courage. In suche manner, that afterwardes they despyse those, whiche were fearefull, vnto them, wherefore he concluded, that those men that would fourthwith, and wythout delaye, come to assaulte the foresayd Syracusains

whileste they were, in that same feare, shoulde haue the better thereof, and shoulde putt the sayedde Syracusayns in greate tremblynge and feare, aswelle for the vieu, of the same armye whiche shoulde seme at the furste syghte to be of muche more people than there was, as also for feare of the euylles which they shoulde consider to be lyke to happene, yf they were vainequyshedde in the battaille. And somuche the more that it was to bileue that manye of the citizeins shoulde be in the feldes whiche doubted not the comynge of the sayd armye, who retyrynge hastely into the Cytye shall leaue behynde theyme muche of their goodes in the feldes, and also many of them shalbe takene bifore that they may retyre, whereby, hauyng afterwardes assieged the cytie, men shall not lacke monney. And on the other parte, by this doynge the other cyties of Sycillle, vpon that poyncte shall choose the rather to make allyance wyth theyme, than wyth the sayedde Syracusains wythoute taryinge or attendynge whiche of the twoo, shall haue the victorye. He sayedde moreouer that in all euentes and chaunces (were it that they retyredde, or that they assaultedde) that they shoulde make the station and soiourne of their shyppes at Megare, for that, that it was desarte and nyghe ynoughe to Saragosse, aswelle by sea, as by lande. Thus Lamachus, dydde speake, and neuerthelas he came agayne to the opynyon, of Alcibiades. Who, after theis thynges, sailledde wyth hys shyppe to passe bifore the cytie of Mamertyas, and requyredde theyme to enter into allyance wyth the Athenyans, whereunto they woulde not consente, nor suffre hym to enter into theyr cytye, neuerthelas they offredde to cause victualles to be delyueredde to be solde wythoute the cytye for hym and hys people, who perceyuynge that, wythoute restynge there, retournedde fromethence to Rhege. And after that he was aryuedde, wyth other the Dukes, they causedde incontinentlye one parte of the armye to be embarquedde wythin three skoore shyppes whiche they victuailledde sufficiently. And leauynge the reste of the people, and of the shyppes at the porte, of Rhege, wyth one of the same Dukes, the other two went wyth the sayed three skoore shyppes strayghte to Naxe,Naxus. whereinto they were receyuedde by the Cytizeins. And fromethence they wente to Catane but there they were not receyuedde, for that, that there was one parte of the cytizeins, whiche toke partie with the Syracusains. For this cause they were constraynedde to retyre vnto the contremounte, of the ryuer of Teria,The ryuer of Teria. where they soiournedde all the same daye. And on the morowe after, they altogether wente fromthence tylle bifore Syracuse. hauynge their shyppes in order in fourme of a cornette, whereof they sente tenne bifore towardes the greate porte, for to see if there were anye shyppes of the ennemyes. And after that they were nyghe the entrynge of the sayed porte, they causedde it to be cryed wyth the sounde of a trompett, that the Athenyans were come thyder, for to restore the Leontyns into their houses, bycause of the amytie and parentage, that they hadde wyth theyme. Wherefore they declaredde to all those of the sayed natyon of Leontyns, that were wythin Syracuse, that they myghte retyre to the sayed Athenyans, as their frendes and bene factors. And after that they hadde made that crye, and welle regardedde and consyderedde the Syte and the facyon aswelle of the Cytye as of the poorte, and also of the countrey rounde aboute, for to knowe on whyche syde they myghte beste assiege yt, they all retournedde frome thence to Catane, and agayne demaundedde the cytizeins, that they shulde suffer them to enter into the cytie, as their frendes, who, after that they had holden their counsaille, made aunswer that they would not suffer the armye to enter but if the Dukes and heddes would enter in their symple estate: they would receyue them wyllyngly and shoulde heare what they

And by thys meane all the other, whiche were abydynge at Rhege, were commaunded to come thider. And they beynge aryuedde, after that they haddde fortefyed and furnysshedde yt, they dydde putt them into yt. And hearynge that the Syracusayns preparedde theyr armye by sea, th

And after that they were nyghe the entryng of the porte, they causedde it to be cryedde with the voyce of a trompett, that they were come. But for all that, the Cameryns woulde not receyue theyme, saying, that they had sworne, not to suffre the Athenyans to enter into their

And incidentlye howe Hipparchus, the brother of Hippias, sometyme Tyrante or euylle gouernour of Athens, was slayne. ☞The .x. Chapter.
               AFter that the Athenyans shippes, were retyred to Catana, one ship of Salamyne, sent by the people of Athens, ariued, for to adiourne Alcibiades to come to aūswere to many crymes and trespasses that openly were obiected and layed agaynst hym, and with hym certene other that were in the Acmye, who were lykewyse chargedde by tokens, to haue bene hys accomplices, aswelle for to violate the mysteries of sacrifices, as also for to cutt a sonder and deface the pictures or ymages called Hermes at Athenes. Of which thynges, after his departure wyth tharmye by sea, the Athenyans ceassed not to pursue the inquyrie. And they arested not onely vpon the proues and apparant coniectures, but rather geuynge faythe to all lyghte suspicions, vpon the sayinge of certeine vnhappy men and of euill name, they dydde take many of the moste honest of the cytie, whome they dyd putt into prysone, groundyng themself vpō this, that it were better to go serchyng and verefying that same matter

by all sortes of coniectures, than for to suffer a man to eskape, of whatsoeuer good renome that he were, throughe faulte of sayinge, that the accusations, whiche were agaynste hym were not suffyciente, and so that he shoulde not be conuyctedde. For that the people hadde herde saye, that the tyrannye of Pysystratus hadde sometyme bene harde and cruell about the ende of hys gouernement,Pysystratus. and coulde not be extinguyshedde, nother by the people, nor by Hermodius,Hermodius. but by the Lacedemonyans. By reasone whereof they were in greate feare and suspicion of the thynges abouesayed, and dydde take all in euylle parte. Albeit that for trouth the enterpryse of Arystogiton,Aristogiton. and Harmodius, dyd take audacytye, for dishoneste loue, as I wylle shewe herafter, and wylle declare, what the Athenyans, and other Grekes, speake of their tyrantes or euill rulers, and of thinges, whiche they haue done hedling, and at their plaisure without knowing in anye thing, the trouth, for the thing, was this.

                     Hippias
                   Pysystratus beyng in his olde age dead, Hippias who was his eldest sonne (and not Hypparchus, as it hath pleased some to say) succeded hym in the pryncipalitie. Nowe there was in the cytie of Athenes, a yonge man, namedde Harmodius, excellente in beawltie. Of whome, by meane thereof, Arystogiton (who was a man of a meane condition) was amorous, and mysusedde hym carnallye. So the same Hermodius, was accused by Hipparchus, sonne of Pysistratus, of that same lewdenes and shamefulle matter. Whereof he beynge conuictedde, dydde complayne to Arystogiton, who for feare, that he hadde to be depryuedde of hys boye, and of hys lewdenes: by the auctorytie of Hypparchus, enterprysedde vnder coulour to be wyllynge to vsurpe the tyrannye of the cytye, for to kepe the sayed boye, and to wythstande that he shoulde not be takene, frome hym vnder couloure of iustyce. In thys meane tyme, Hipparchus,Hipparchus. wente aboute for to withdrawe the sayed Hermodius by 
                     •
                  aier speche and flateryes, and perceyuyng, that he coulde nothynge proffytte by that meane, preparedde hymselfe to brynge hym to shame by iustice without vsynge of annye force, for also it was not lawfulle for hym to do it, insomuche as the tyrantes of that same tyme hadde not yet taken vpon theym greater auctorytie ouer their subiectes, than by forme of iustice. By occasion whereof, and also that those whiche vsurpedde suche tyrannycall gouernemente, excercisedde theymselfe in the remenante in all vertues and in all prudencie: Those same tyrauntes were not greatly noysome nor displeasante. For also they dydde not extorte of the cytizeins any other trybute, but the twentith parte of their reuenue, wherewyth they made many fayer reparations in the c
                     •
                  tie, and also susteignedde manye greate warres agaynste theyr neyghbours. And as touchynge the other thynges, they lefte theyme intierly vnto the cytizeins accordynge to their auncyente lawes, forprysed and resarued onely this, that they founde manner by their auctortye, that one amongest theyme was alwayes chosene by the comons vnto the pryncypall offices of the cytye, whereby some of them be founde to haue yerelye offices in the cytye Athenes. And Pysystratus, sonne of Hyppias, who hadde the name of hys grandefather, holdynge the seignorye after the deathe of hys father, dedicatedde, in the myddelle of the markette place, the temple of the twelue goddes and that same of Apollo Pythius. And he caused to be defacedde or blottedde out one Epigrame or Epytaphy: whiche was sette vp in the markett place, whyche was afterwardes repaired and enlarged by the comons. And yet neuerthelas the sayd Epigrame was not vtterly defaced, but onely duskened or so rased, that yet it myght be redde, thoughe that with some difficultie, which was of this substance. The Epigrame, which Pisistratus setteth in the temple of Apollo

Pythius, that Hippias lefte for remembrance, of hys Empire. And this, whiche. I haue sayed, that Hippias sonne of Pisistratus obt eignedde the seigniorye after hys father, insomuche, as he was eldest, I canne affirme yt clerely to be true, by this, that I haue inquired, and serched more of the common renome of that same time, than any other. And euery man that woll serche & inquier may knowe yt, by this, that it is not founde, that any of the legytymate sonnes of the sayed Pysistratus, had any childrene, but onely he, as it may he parceyued, by the auncient monumentes, or graues that be in t he sayed temple, and also by an Epi

                  aphie, whiche is in the castell of Athenes, grauene in stoane, makynge mention of the noughtynes, of the sayd tyrantes, wherin no mention is made of any childrē of Hipparchus, nother of Thessalus,Mhessalus. but welle of fyue chyldren, whiche Hippias hadde by Callis,Callis. doughter fo Hipperchide. Also it is lyke to be trewe, that he maryedde the eldest of this chyldren, furst: and also beinge eldest, it is to bileue, that he succededde, nexte in the Seigniorye, and tyrannye. And it semeth not vnto me to haue any apparance, that if Hipparchus, had bene slayne, possessyng the Seignyorye: that Hippias incontmently after coulde haue obteigneddde yt, and also exercise it the selfe daye, that the other dyedde, but rather hauyng already a longe tyme vsedde hys auctorytie imperially towardes the subiectes, and lyued frendely and discretelye wyth hys adherentes and frendes: feared not to reteigne and kepe hys Seigniorye and pryncipalytie, whatsoeuer thynge had happenedde to hys brother: euene so, as hys sayed brother woulde happely haue done, if that the chaunce hadde happenedde to that same Hippias, for that, that he was alreadye exercisedde and accustomedde, in the Seigniorye. But that, whiche geueth thys reaporte to Hipparchus and causeth theyme, that came after to bileue, that he had obteigned, the pryncipalitie and Seigniorye of Athens: was through cause of the myschance, whiche happenedde vnto hym, by occasyon of that, whyche is bifore sayed. For parceyuynge that he coulde not wythdrawe or bryng Hermodius to hys wyll, he ymagined agaynst hym one suche woorke and despyte. The same Hermodius, hadde a yonge suster, a maydene, who comminge in an assemblie of other maydens, of her estate, to a certene solempnytie that was made in the cytie, carying a paynyer or baskette, as the other dyd: Hipparchus, by hys ministers, causedde her to retyre and to be putt oute of the sayedde compaignie, sayinge that she was not calledde, to the sayed solempnytie, for she was not woorthy to be there, wyllynge to doo it to be vnderstande, that she was no maydene, whereby Hermodius, was more and more, grudgedde and spitefull, and Aristogitonne also for hys sake. And so, they cogiders wyth the complices of that same conspiratie determyned, whan it shuld be expedient for to execute it, but they taryedde the daye of the feaste, whyche ys calledde, the greate feaste of Panne, for that, that on the same daye yt was permytted to euerye man, withoute any susspycion, to weare harnnes, throughe the towne. And so yt was concludedde amongeste theyme, that on the sayedde daye: the same Hermodius and Arystogiton, shoulde charge vpon Hipparchus, and the other complices, vpon the garde or sargeantes. And albeyt that the same complices were in smalle nomber, yet for to kepe the thynge secrettt, they perswaded theymselfe that whan the other cytezeins, that should be assembled, should see them charge vpon the tyrantes or gouernours, thoughe that they knewe nothynge of the enterpryse, beynge yet in armure, they all woulde ioigne wyth theyme for to recouer their lybertie. Than, whan the feast daye came, Hippias was in a place, a parte, namedde Cerannicus wyth the souldyars of hys garde, and ordeyned the ceremonies of that same solempnitie as it apperteigned. And as Hermodius and Aristogiton came directly

vnto hym wyth their daggers for to slaye hym, they parceyued one of their complices, that was speakynge with the sayedde Hyppias very famyliarlye (for that, that he was gentle to geue audience) whereby they were afrayed that their sayd compaigny on hadde discouered the enterpryse, and leste they shulde be incontynently takene. And so determyned bifore that they would be empeigned or layde hande vpon, to take vengeance on hym, that was cause of their conspiracie. To wytt, Hipparchus, if they coulde. And fourthwith entred into a place, called Leocorus, wherin Hipparchus was. And so they russhed vpon hym wyth suche a furye, for hatred and disdeigne, whiche they had agaynste hym, that they dyd slaye hym incontinently. And that done Aristogiton at begynnyng sauedde hymself amonge the souldeours and garde of the tyrantes, notwythstandynge he was afterwardes takene and soore hurte, but Hermodius was slayne vpon the place. Hippias being aduertifed in the sayd place of Cerannicus of this matter: did not soudainely repaire vnto the place, where the chance was commytted, but wente straight waye thider, where as the people of the towne being armed were assembled for the pompe or solempnytte, bifore that they had any vnders

                  andynge of the dede. And makyng good chere, and shewynge a ioyfull countenance euene as as no suche thynge had bene done, he caused 
                     •
                  o comaunde them, that they shulde all withdrawe themself without armure into a certein place, whiche he caused to be shewed vnto them, whiche thyng they did, thynking that he would haue sayd something vnto them. And fourthwith, as they were there, he sent his souldears, and garde, for to take from them, their armure, and to apprehende those, whom he had
                     •
                   in suspection, pryncipally them that were founde wearynge daggers. For the custome was in that same solempnytie, to carye speares and targottes onely. In this manner, throughe foolyshe loue, the furste conspiracie was bigonne and enterprysedde agaynste the Tyrantes of Athens, and executed foolyshly for the soubdayne feare, whiche they had, that enterprysedde yt, to haue bene discouered, whereby greate euylle insuedde afterwardes to the Athenyans. For in tyme followynge, the tyrantes were more cruell, than they hadde bene, for that that Hippias fearynge to be circumuentedde: causedde manye of the cytizeins to dye, and also prouydedde hymselfe wyth allyances and frendeshyps, wythout the towne, for to wythdrawe and saue hymselfe, yf annye mutation or change happenedde wythin the cytie. For this cause, he maryed his doughter, named Archedice,Archedices. vnto Hippoclus sonne of Eantydes,
                     Hippocius.
                     Eātides
                   Tyrante of Lamsaque, for that that he knewe that the sayed Eantydes hadde greate amytie wyth Darie, kynge of Persie. The Sepulcre or graue of whiche woman is yet to be sene in Lamsacque aforesayd, wherevpon was an Epitaphe of this substance. Here lyeth Archedice, doughter of Hyppias defendoure of the Grekes, who, althoughe that she was doughter, wyfe and suster of Tyrantes, dydde not yett therefore annye proude or violente thynge. Neuerthelas three yeares arter this, whiche we haue spokene, Hippias was chasedde by the Lacedemonyans and by the Alemonides oute of the Seigniorye and tyrannye of Athenes. And wente fromethence wyth hys good will vnto Eantides in Sigee and vnto Lampsaque,Sigeū. and fromethence vnto the kyng Darius, and twentye yeares after (beyng than verye olde) he dydde come wyth the Medes agaynste the Grekes at Marathonie. The people of Athenes, bryngyng thies auncient thynges to remembrance, was more sharpe and more chafedde to enquier of this same matter of the dyssyguredde ymages and of the corrupted sacrefices, fearynge to come agayne into subiection of tyrantes. And perswaded themself that the sayed excesse and mysdedes had bene done to the same entente. By occasion whereof many greate personages of the cytie were putt into

prysone. And the persecution and wrath of the commons encreasedde dayllye to apprehende, and imprysone men, vntylle that one of theym that hadde bene takene and was reputed for moste coulpable, at perswation of one of the other prysoners, discoueredde the thynge, were it truely or faulselye, for the trouth coulde neuer be knowyn nother than nor afterwardes. But somuche there was, that he was perswadedde, that if he discoueredde the case, by accusynge of hymselfe and of some other, he shoulde putt the reste of the cytye oute of suspition and of danger. And also by so doynge shoulde be in suertie for to escape and to be delyueredde. By this meane he confessedde the case of Hermes or pictures, as touchyng hymself, and also accused a compaignie of other, whome he declared to haue bene partakers therof, whereby the comons, thynkyng that he had sayed the trouthe, were ryght ioyfull. For they were tomuche angry, that no knowlaige coulde be had of a dede, done by so great nomber of people. And so he, that had confessedde the matter, togiders wyth the other, whome he had not chargedde: were fourthwyth delyuered. And of those, which he had charged, al they that might be taken were putt to execution by sentence or iudgemente. The other, that fledde fromethence, were condempnedde of contumacye to death, and a huyer was lymytedde and appoynctedde for all men, whiche dydde slaye theyme. And yett was it not knowyn for trouthe, whider that those, whiche had bene executed, were gylty or not. Neuerthelas in all the rest the cytie reputed itselfe to haue gaigned and profytedde greatly. But the comons were displeasedde, wyth Alcibiades, who was accused of this chance, of the ymages by his ennemyes, to wytte, by those same, that had charged him therwith bifore his departure. And takyng it to be trewe that he had bene gilty of the case, of the Hermes or pictures, they easely perswaded themself, that he likewise had bene partaker of the other case of the sacrefices with the other complices & conspirators against the comons. And the suspection didde growe somuche the more, that a certene small nomber of warryours beyng Lacedemonyans, did in that self time come vntill the distreate of Peloponese, for to appoynte and intreate of some matter, with the Beotians. Wherby the Atheniās had suspicion, that it had bene through consent of the said Alcibiades, vnder coulour of the sayd treatie, and that if the same Atheniās, had not preuented to take the sayd citizeins, whome they had taken vpon suspition, the cytie had bene in dā
                  ger to be taken and betrayed. And the suspition was so great, that a great watch in armure, was for one nyght, kept in the cytie of the temple of Theseus. In the selfe tyme the gestes and frendes of the same Alcibiades, which were in the cytie of Argos, were suspected, to be willing for to inuade the comons, which thing, being by them signefyed vnto the Athenyans, they licenced the sayed Argiues for to slaye the citizeins of Athens, which they had in their citie of Argos, who were deliuered vnto them, for hostage, and by them to be sent vnto certaine Islandes. In this manner, Alcibiades was suspected, on all sydes. Whereupon they that were wyllynge to cause hym to come to iudgemente, for to condempne hym to death: purchased to cause hym to be adiournedde or somoned in Sycile, togiders wt the other, of whome hathe bene spokene, and gaue charge vnto the Messenger: that he shoulde comaunde hym to followe hym incontinentlye, and not to take hym, for feare that they hadde aswell of the compaignions of warre which he had vnder his charge, as also that the affaire of the enterpryse of Sycille shulde not be troubledde, and yet moste pryncipallye that the Mantynyens, and the Argiues (who at the desyre of the same Alcibiades accompanyedde the sayed Athenyans in that same enterpryse) shoulde not be mouedde or loste. Than Alcibiades, percey

                  ynge the comaundemente and adiournynge, that was made vnto hym,

mounted into a shypp, and the other also adiourned did mounte withe him, and departed fromthence togiders wyth the ship of Salamyne, whych was comme for to adiourne them: fayning to be willing to saille in compagnie vnto Athens. But after that they were in Thurie, they followed it no further: nother afterwardes were sene by those of the sayd shipp of Salamyne: who, hauynge carefullye enquyred, what way they were gone, and not learnyng any newes therof, they saylled frōthence their right way. Sone after Alcibiades departed from Thurie, and sailled fromthence to lande in Peloponese: being already bannyshedde from Athens. And so after, he and the other, whych were in hys compaigny were condempned for contuinacye vnto death by the Athenyans.
            
            
               ¶Howe after the departure of Alcibiades, the other two Dukes Athenyans, hauynge done certen small thynges in Sycille, did come to assiege the cytie of Saragosse and hadde a victorye agaynste the Syracusains. ☞The .xi. Chapter.
               AFter the departure of Alcibiades, the other twoo Dukes Athenyans departed all the armye into two partes: and aither of theym. dyd by lott take the charge of the one of theym. And afterwardes they bothe togiders wyth all the hoste, wente fromthence vnto Selynunte, and to Egeste for to knowe if the Egestians were determyned to delyuer the monney, whyche they had promysed, and also for to vnderstāde the affayre of the said Selynuntyns and the question or difference, whyche they had wyth the Egestains. And they saylled a length the sea, hauynge the Isle of Sycille of the coste of the sea Ionum on the lefte hande, and came to aboorde bifore the cytie of Imere: the whyche only in that same quarter is inhabyted wyth Grekes, neuerthelesse they woolde not receyue the sayd Athenyans, who, at their departure fromthēce, sailled to a towne named Hiccara.Hiccara. The whyche, though that it were inhabytedde wyth Sycaniens was yet ennemy to the Egestains. For this cause, they pillaged yt, and afterwardes did set of the Egestains wythin it. Thys dependinge arryued the horsemen of the Egestains, wyth whome the fotemen Athenyans came by lande wythin the Isle, pillaginge and robbinge vntill Catana, and their ships came vnto them coastynge alongeste the sea, wherin they charged their butyes & pillage, aswell of beastes as of the other. Nycias at departure frō Heccana, wēte incontynently to Egeste. where he receiued of the Egestains thirty talentes. And hauynge geuen order for certen other thynges, retourned fromthence into the armye. And besyde that some, that they had taken for the sayd butye, whych was solde, they receyued one houndred and twenty talētes of golde. Afterwards they wente enuyroning the Isle, and in their passage dydde geue order to their allyes that they shulde sende them the nomber of men, whyche they had promysedde. And so they came wyth the moytie of the armye before the towne of Hibla in the terrytory of Gela (the whyche toke the partie againste them) thinkyng to take it,Hybla. but they coulde not, and in this meane tyme, the ende of Somer dyd come. At begynnynge of the wynter, the Athenyans prepared themself for to come to assiege Sarragosse, and on the other syde the Syracusains prepared theymselfe for to come to mete them. For insomuche as the Athenyans did not at beginning come to assaylle them, they toke dayly more and more courage. And somuche the lesse they fearedde and estemed them, that they had enuironned and compassed about the other countrey by sea very farre frome theire cytie, and also coulde not take

Hybla.Hybla. whereupon the sayd Syracusains were so puffed vp, that they requyred of their Dukes that they shulde conducte them vnto Catana, where the enemys were, insomuch as they durste not come thider vnto them. And the lyght horsemen Syracusains, whych ronned daylly vnto the campe of the said Athenyans, among other reproches, whiche they vsed, demanded of theym, if they were not more comme to inhabitt rather an other mans lande, than for to restore the Leontins into theirs. The Athenyans, knowinge suche thyngs, essaiedde to wythdrawe those Syracusains so farre, as they coulde, from their cytie, to the intente that the more wyth their ease, they myght in one nyght wyth their shipps, saille to lande before the towne, and lodge theire campe in place, where they shulde thinke most mete. For they knewe well, that if at landing out of their ships, they founde the ennemyes in order and prepared for to defende theire landinge: orels if that they woulde take their waye fromthence by lande vnto the sayde cytie: they shuld haue much more difficultie. For their horsmen might do greate dammaige vnto their fotemen beynge lyght armed, and also to the reste of their fote men, considered that they had yet small nomber of horsmen there. And doing as they had enterprysed, they might wtout any great empeschement take the place, whych they desired, before that the horsmen Syracusains shulde haue bene retourned, which place had bene taught and shewed vnto them, by the bannished men of the same cytie, who followedde them, to witt, nyghe vnto the temple of Olympus. And for to execute their enterpryse, they vsedde one suche a cautelle. That is, that they sente one (whome they right wel trusted) vnto the Dukes of Syracusains, knowinge also that they wolde geue fayth vnto that, whyche he shulde shewe them, fayninge to be sente from certen of the princypalle of the cytie of Catana, wherof he was, whom the said dukes did well knowe) saying that they yet helde their partie, and that if they wolde, they wold cause them to haue ye victorie against the Athenyans by such meane: for one partie of the armye of ye said Athenyans kept thēself wtin the towne without armure. So that if the said Syracusains, issued fourth, at one daye named, oute of Sarragosse and arryued at the breake of the day wt all their puissance: those same Catanyens, whome he named vnto them wyth their complices, shuld easely enclose the Athenyās, that were wtin the towne, and also wold put fyer into their ships, which were in their port. By which doing, if the said Syracusains wolde rush out and charge vpon them that were in the feld, which was without the towne, enclosed wyth Pales, they might take it without any great difficultie, and destroy all that they shulde fynde wtin it: saying moreouer that there were many cytezeins of Catane of thys intellygence and conspyratie, all ready and determined for to execute it: who had sente hym thyder. The dukes Syracusains, which were bolde, and besides that had already desire to go vnto the enemyes in their campe, did lightly bileue the espie. And hauing taken a day wyth him, whan they wold be at Catana, they sent him agayn vnto them, frō whom he sayd that he was come. And at the said daye failled not to issue fourth all the people of the cytie wyth the succours of the Selynūtyns, and some other their allyes that were already come, and for haste they went fourth wtout order altogiders for to lodge nygh to Catana vpon the riuer of Symethe in the lande of Leontyns.Symethus. Than the Athenyās, vnderstanding their comyng, did charge all their people, that they had, aswell Athenyans, as Sycilians and othere, in their shippes, and saylledde by nyght, towardes Sarragosse. where they arryued at breake of daye wythin the greate porte, bifore the temple of Olympus for to lande there. In thys meane tyme, the horsemen Syracusains, whyche were goone to Catana, vnderstandynge that all the Athenyans

ships were departed out of the porte of Catana, aduertysed the fotemen thereof, and all togyders dyd take their way for to retourne to the succours of their cytie. But for that, that the waye was longe, byfore that they coulde aryue, the Athenyans had already landed, and taken their lodging in the place, whyche they had chosen: out of the whych, they myght defende themself to their aduantaige, with out beinge in dangier before that they had made their rampares, nother yet by makynge of them, insomuche as they were shadowed couered or defended wyth walles and buildinges in that same quarter. And moreouere there was manye trees, a standing water, and hollowe or broken places. So that none could come vpon them out of the same quarter, specyally horsmen. And on the other parte, they had already hewed downe a great quantytie of the sayd trees, whyche they had caryed to the sea syde, and there planted and locked togiders in manner of ouerthwarte crosses, for to defende and let, that no man shulde issue fourthe into theirs ships Moreouer in that same quarter, where their campe was most lowe, and where the cōming therinto was most easy, they had rampared it with great stoanes and wyth woode in haste, so that yt was very harde to enter there, and afterwardes they dyd breake the bridge, whyche they had made for to goo vnto their ships. All whyche woorke they dyd at their ease, without thys, that annye man yssued oute of the citie for to empesche them, for they were all gone fourth & were not yet retourned from Catana, of whom the horsmen were the firste that came agayne, and sone after all the people that were issued fourthe, and came directely agaynste the Athenyans, to presente theym bataylle. But seing that they yssued not fourth, they wythdrewe and wente to lodge themselfe on the othere syde of the way, whyche leadeth to Heloryne. The morowe after, the Athenyans yssued fourth for to fyght, and they ordeyned their battaille in this sorte. For at the ryght poyncte they sett the Argiues and the Mantynyans, at the lefte, the other their allyes, and in the myddell the Athenyans. And also the one moytie of the army was of the thicknes of eyght renkes in the fronte

               The exhortation of Nycias to hys souldears. ☞The .xii. Chapter.
               WHat nedeth it, Lordes, that I make greate exhortation for to fighte valyātly, vnto youe, that be here ready to do yt. Trulye the preparation, whyche I see here, semeth to me to haue moore effycacytie for to geue youe courayge and audacytie, than all the talke, that anny man

lyuynge coulde vse, if that we were euyll appoincted. Nowe be we here, Argiues, Mantynyans and Athenyans, the moste principall aud superiours of all the Islanders and inhabitantes in the Islandes. Howe can we than in so great a nōber of such frends & allyes not haue certen hope of the victorie, specially hauing to do against comō people & those, which be not chosen as we be? And also thies be Syciliās yt dispyse vs afarre of, but being nighe vnto them they wyl not tary vs, insomuch as they haue lesse of knowlaige & experience, than of audacytie. I wol also y• euery of you do bring to his remembrance, that we be here in a strange land farre from ours, and not being our frende, the whyche we cannot obteigne wtout the victorie. For his cause I will exhorte by all reasons contrary to the same, by the whych I presuppose that our enemys shalbe exhorted by their capitains. For they woll shewe thē, that they haue to fyght for defence of their owne land. And I do shewe you that we be in a strange lande, in the which we must ayther vainquishe, orels haue no greate hope for to retourne into ours, for they haue plenty of horses that wil oppresse vs greatly, if that we breke our aray. wherfore, as mē valyant & hardy, be willing to assaile the enemys manfully, remēbring youre ancyent vertue & force, & setting bifore your eyes, that the necessitie, wherin we be, is muche more to be feared, than the puissance of our ennemys. After that Nycias had thus spokē, he caused his men to marche against thennemys, who loked not yt they shulde haue so sone presented them ba

But where as they came, there they mingled themself with the other, and shewed aswel in that same battaill, as in all other affayres, that they lacked not nother harte nor bardynes, more than those, that did assaille them: but rather did defende thēself valyantly, so long as they perceyued any meane to be hable to do it. And whan they were cōstrayned to retire, they did it vnwillingly & slackly: but howsoeuer it was, not thinking at that present, that the Atheniās wold haue come to assaile them, & by that meane being soubdainly taken, they armed themselfe hastely and came to mete their enemys.

So it happened that the Argiues furst, and afterwards the Athenyans on the syde where they were, made a charge so sharpely vpon the Syracusains, that they dyd put them into disorder: and sone after to flight. Neuertheles they followed them not farre, for feare of the horsmen, which were in greate nomber and hadde not bene brokene or putt out of order. who, after that they parceyued somme o

For this cause the Atheniās pursued the Syracusains being in flight, somuche as they coulde, all locked togiders. Afterwards they retyred in the selfe order into their campe, and there they reised vp their trophee in signe of victorie. And the Syracusains retired the best that they could, likewise into their campe. And fourthwith sent a good nomber from them to the temple of Olympiades, whyche was therby, fearynge leaste the Athenyans wolde come to pillage it, for that, that therin was great quantyte of golde and syluer.

               AFter that the Syracusains had caused their dead men to be buryed, the people was assembled. In the whyche assemblie, Hermocrates, sonne of Hermon, who was estemed as greatly wyse and prudente, as any man of the cytie, and moreouer valyante and experymented

in matters and feate of warre, made vnto them many declarations and perswations for to geue them courage,The declaratiō of Hermocrates vnto the Syracusains. and that they shuld not be astonied for the losse, whiche they had had, shewynge vnto them that the same losse was not chanced to them through lacke of courage, but through faulte of order, and also that yt was not so greate as by reason it shulde haue bene, consyderinge that on theire side, there were none but comon people and men not often experimēted in warre: and the ennemyes were the beste practysedde of all Grece, and suche as vsed the crafte and feate of warre, more than of any other thynge. Also the multytude of their capytaynes dyd noye them greatly. For there were fyue of them that had not greate obeyssance of their souldyars.

And also it were necessarye that the Dukes and Capytayns (whych are to be chosen in small nōber as is aboue said) shulde haue power in the feate of warre, for to order and do therein, euene as yt shulde seme to them to be expedyent: for the welthe of the cytie, geuynge them othe
                     •
                   suche, as ys requysite in the same & lyke cases. For by thys meane, the thinges, whyche shulde be nedefull to be holden secrett, may be kepte close, and moreouer the prouysyons may be made without any contradiction. After that Hermocrates had ended hys aduertysements, all the people founde them good, and dyd chose hymself for one of the Capytayns and wyth hym Heraclides,Heraclides. sonne of Lysymachus and Sycanus sonne of Excrestus.Sycanus. whome also they dyd chose Ambassadours for to go to the Lacedemonyans and Corynthians for to perswade them that they shulde ioygne togiders wyth them agaynste the Athenyans and that they shulde make so stronge and fierce warre in theire countreye, that they shulde be constrayned to habandone and forsake Sycille, orels that they shulde sende to the sayde Syracusains succours by sea. In this meane tyme, the armye of the Athenyans, whyche was at Catana, went fromthence agaynste Messane, hopinge to haue taken it by treatie and conspyracie of some of the Cytezeins. But they were deceyuedde of their enterpryse, for that, that Alcibiades, who knewe ye sayde treatie, after that he was departed out of the hoste, holding hymself in all poynctes assured, that he shulde be bannyshed out of Athens: had secretely discouered the treasone of those of the sayd cytie, whyche toke parte. wyth the Syracusains. who hauynge furste slayne the transgressours and afterwardes moued the comons agaynste them and their complices: obteygned what they woolde, to wytt, that the Atheuyans shulde not be receyued into the cytie. who, aftere that they hadde bene in the campe .xiii. dayes before the sayde Cytie, parceyuinge that the wynter increased and waxed more bitter, and that they beganne to lacke victualles, also that theyre enterpryse faylled them: they retyredde to Naxe and to Thrace, where they forcefyed their campe with diches and pales, and there passed that same wynter. Durynge the whyche, they sente a galley vnto Athens, for to demande newe succours wyth horsemen and wythe monney for the sprynge tyme followynge, that they myght be hable to issue fourth into the feldes. On the other syde, the Syracusains, duringe that same wynter, enclosed wyth walles, al the suburbs, whyche was on the syde of Epipole,Epibola to the intent, that if by fortune

they loste an other tyme the battaille in the feldes, they might haue the greater space for to retyre wythin the closure of the Cytie: and besydes that, they made newe rampares aboutes the temple of Olympus, and of the place called Megare: and therin they put a good garnyson. And moreouer in all sydes, where men might descende from the sea to lande against the Cytie, they made strong crosse barres and pales. After that, knowinge howe the Athenyans had embarqued thē

               ¶Howe the Athenyans and the Syracusains sente Ambassadours towardes the Cameryns, ayther partie for to withdraw them to their allyance, and the answer, which they made to them both. And also the preparations & practiques, that the Athenyans made that same winter against the Syracusains. ☞The .xiiii. Chapter.
               THies thinges thus done, the Syracusains being aduertysed that the Athenyans had sente to the Cameryns, for to confirme the allyance, that they hadde in tymes paste made withe Lachetes, at that tyme Duke of Athens, they sent thider lykewyse for their partie: for they had not very great confydence in them insomuche as at the other battaille, they had shewed themself very cold in sending their succour, wherby they had greate doubte, least they wold sende no more in tyme to come: and also least they wold take part wt the Athenyans, seing them to haue had ye victorie in the said battail, vnder colour of the said auncyēt allyance. Hermocrates wt some other Ambassadours being than come thider for the Syracusains, & Euphemus & certen other for the Athenyans, the same Hermocrates didde speake before the people of Camaryne, who was assembled for that purpose, in thys manner, in presence of the Ambassadours of Athenes.
               
                  The Oration of Hermocrates to the Camerins.
                  WE be not sente hither vnto you Cameryus, for doubte that we haue, that ye be afrayde of thys army of the Athenyans: but for feare leaste through their artificiall and subtille woordes (before hauinge bene by vs aduertised) they shulde induce and allure you to their purpose. whyche is to do vnder the coulour, whiche youe haue parceyued, the thinge that we all do suspecte. And as for me I am ryght certeine that they be not come for to restore & set the Leontins again into their houses: but rather to chase vs oute of ours. For it is not to beleue that they, which dryue those same of Grece out of their cyties, be come hider for to sett agayn those of this countrey into the same, out of which they be chased. Nother that they haue so great care, as they saie, for the Leontins, as for their cousins for that, that they be Chalcydes, seing that the self Chalcydes (of whom thies be descendedde) be by theym broughte into seruytude & bondage: but rather vnder the coulour, wherby they haue obteigned those there, they wold presently obteigne the coūtrey in thies parties. For being voluntarely chosen capitains of tharmy of Grekes for to resiste the Medes, by ye Ionians and other Colonies of their allyāce, they haue reduced & broughte them into their obeissance. Some vnder colour yt they had forsakē tharmy wtout lycence

Some other by occasions of warrs & questiōs that they had amongest themself & the other vnder suche other coloures as they did finde for their purpose, whan they dyd see oportunitie. In suche maner that it may be sayd for trouth, that the Athenyans made not warre agaynste the Medes for the lybertie of Grece, nor the other Grekes to enioye their owne, but rather they dyd make it to the intent that the Grekes shulde sarue to them and not to the Medes. And those self Grekes for to change the lorde, and not for to change him that ruled moste stronge for the same that ruled more weakely: but onely him that imagined moste euil, & how he shuld gouerne hym, that intended beste. And albeit that the same Cytie of Athenes be greately worthye of reprehension and reproche: yet we be not come hyder to procure it before people, whych knowe ynough of their wyll: but rather for to rebuke vs other Syciliens, whyche haue before oure eyes the example of the other cyties of Grece, that they haue subdued: and yet notwithstanding thynke not to defende ourselues from them, nother to reiecte and caste of the fallaces and sophemes, that they wolde delyuer vs, to wytte, that they be come for to ayde the Leontins, as their cowsins, and the Egestains, as their allyes. Wherfore me thinketh that we shulde the sooner thinke on our case, and doo them to knowe, that we be not Ionyens, Hellespontyns nor Islanders: whyche haue alwayes accustomed to be subiects of the Medes, and also of other, so that they do but change the lorde, into whosoeuer handes they fail. But we be Doriens of a free nation and come oute of Peloponese, whyche is a franke countrey and inhabyting in Sycille. And ought not to abyde vntill we be taken towne after town, knowynge that by thys onely meane we maye be taken, and that for this cause they haue prepared themself, and by that meane they goo about to separate and set vs asonder, some by their practices and vnder the colour of their alliance, to set some to warre against the other, and in speakynge gracyous and ioyful words, to do all the euyll that they maye vnto vs all accordinge as they shall fynde occasion. And if there be any one amonge vs, that perswadeth himself that the euil, which cometh to an other, that is not his next neyghbour, is yet very farre frome hym, and that it shall remayne there wtout coming to him, and that it is not be, to whome the Athenyans be ennemyes, but well they be the Syracusains, and that by this meane it shuld be follie to put his part in dangier, for to saue myne: I say vnto him, that he vnderstandeth not well, and that he ought to consider y• defending myne, he defendeth his owne propre asmuch as myne. And somuche he doth it more assuredly and more to his aduantage, that he hath me in his cō
                     paigny before that I be destroyd, for so I may helpe hym. Also, whosoeuer hath suche fantasie, he ought to consyder, that the Athenyans be not comme for to reuenge themself of the Syracusains for any ennemytie that they haue to them, but rather vnder coulour herof, to confirme their amytie with youe. And if there be any, which enuieth vs or that feareth vs, for that, that it is the custome, that the more puissant be alwaies enuyed or feared of the more feoble, and therfore it semeth to him, that if we receyue any dammage, we shalbe moore tractable and more gracious, and that he neuertheles shall remaine the more in suertie: trulye he trustethe in the thinge that is not in the power of hys intente and wylle. For men haue not fortune in their power, euen as they haue their wyll. And therfore if it happene otherwyse, than he thynketh: whyche hath suche fantasie, peraduenture that for the grief of the euyll that shall come vpon himselfe, he shall desire at an other tyme to enioye me and my goods lyke as he hath done before tyme: that shalbe impossyble for hym: sithens that he shall haue forsaken and refused to be wt me in dangiers of fortune, that were asmuche hys, as myne, not in name

and in worde: but in effecte. For he, that aydeth vs in this affaire, he in name defendeth our estate, but in effecte he defendeth hys oune. And trulye reasone wolleth well, that ye other Camerins, which be our neighbours and in the self dāger, wherein we be, shulde consyder thies thinges here and ought to haue cōme to our allyance more readely than ye haue not done, and that of your owne good will for to comforte and admonishe vs that we shulde not lose oure coura

And yf ye woll say that youe woll kepe and vse reasone somuche towardes vs, as towardes oure ennemyes for feare to offende the one or the other, and take youre occasyon vpon the allyance, whyche youe haue wyth them: Truly ye haue not made that same allyaunce for to go to assaylle youre frendes at their pleasure and appetite: but rather onely for to succour the one the other, if any dyd come to assaille youe. For thys cause the Rhegins, though that they be Chalcydes, haue not bene willinge to ioygne wyth thies here for to restore the Leontins into their houses, who be Chalcydes as they be. And if those there, wythout hauing any reasonable excuse, but for that, that they haue had this iustification or proufe so well couloured of the Athenyans, for suspected, gouerned themself herin wysely: woll you (hauinge reasonable cause for to excuse youe) beare fauour and proffitt vnto them, that naturelly be y

                      vnto thies here? Certainly ye shall do agaynste reasone, yf ye woll ayde thys puissance of enemyes, which ye ought rather to feare, although that if we were ioigned and vnited togider, we shulde haue no cause to feare: but iustly if we separate or deuyde oureselues the one from the other. Whiche is the thinge that they attempte for their power, for that, that they be come into thys countrey not onely agaynste vs, but rathere agaynste all. And yet they haue not done agaynste vs that, whyche they wylledde, though that they dydde vaynquishe vs in battaille, but after their victorie, they wente fromthence. Wherefore it may be clerly knowin, that whan we shalbe ioigned togiders, we ought not greately to care for them, and chiefly attendyng the succours that is to come from the Peloponesyans, whyche be better warryours than thies here. And truly yt ought not to seme to anny to be good for youe, not to busye youreselfe or not to meddle, nother for theym nor vs, and that the same shalbe reasonable as touching vs, consyderinge that ye be allyed togyder, and also the more suertie for you. For though that the ryght be at the furste sight lyke and egall betwene them and vs as concernynge you for the reason abouesaide: yet the dede ys greately dyuers. For if they, agaynste whom warre ys made for fault to haue bene by you succoured, be vainquished, and the other vainquishors and ouercommers: what other thynge maye be sayde, than that by your absence, the one hath bene ouercomed and the other haue not bene prohybited or left to do euyll. Therfore lordes, it shalbe muche better done for to ayde those, whome men wolde oppresse, whiche be your parentes and neyghbours, in defending the comon welth of all Sycille, and not to suffer the Athenians to offende: than not to meddle wyth nother partie. And for to shewe you in fewe wordes all that we woll saye, insomuche as there nede not many wordes, for to declare to you or to any other that, which ye vnderstande of yourself: we praye and require youe for to ayde vs in thys present busynes. And we protest that if youe do it not: ye shal suffre vs to be wasted and destroyed by the Ionyens our perpetuall ennemyes. And being Doryens, as we be, ye habandone & forsake vs noughtly. And if we be

vaynquyshed by the Athenyans, it shalbe youre faulte, and they shalle haue the glorye of the victory. And as touchynge the huyer or rewarde, it shalbe none othere, but the same, that hath geuene the victorye. And if we ouercomme, ye shall suffer the payne, for that, that ye haue bene cause of the dangeire, where in we shall haue bene. Consider than the whole, and chose ye presently aythere to incurre and submit yourself into the seruitude presented without any danger, or in ouercommynge thys people, both to eskape wyth vs from beinge their subiectes, and also not to be for a right longe tyme our ennemyes. After that Hermocrates had thus spokene, Euphemus the Athenyan arose vp and dydde speake in thys manner.
               
            
            
               ¶ The Oration of Euphemus the Athenyan to the Camerins. ☞The .xv. Chapter.
               WE were comme hider, Lordes Camerins, onely for to renewe the ancyent amytie & allyāce that we haue with you. But sithens that this same Syracusaine hath charged and maliciously spoken agaynst vs, It is here nedefull to speake of our Empire, and howe, by good and iuste cause and reasone, we haue obteygned it: whereof thys same here, who hath spoken, beareth good wytnes by that, which he hath said, that ye Ionyens haue al waies ben enemys of the Doriens: but it muste be vnderstande, how it is. We be truly Ionyens, and the Peloponesyans Doriens. And for that, that they be in greater nomber than we and our neyghbours, we haue trauailled to kepe oureselues, that they shulde not bringe vs into their subiection. For this cause, after the warre of the Medes, hauinge our army by sea, we wythdrewe ourselfe from the Empire and conducte of the Lacedemonyans, which were capytaines of all the armye of Grece, for that, that it was not more reasonable that we shulde be vnder them, than they vnder vs, but for that, that they haue bene more puissant than we. And consequently beinge made prynces and superiours of Grekes, who before tyme were subiectes vnto the Medes: we haue kepte and maignteigned oure reygne: knowynge that whan we shall haue asmuche puissance as they, for to resyste their force, that than we shall in nothynge be bounde vnto them. And for to speke more clerely, we haue vpon good cause brought into our obeissance and subiection the Ionyans and the Islanders, though that they be oure parentes, as the Syracusains do say. But it was for thys cause, that they came wyth the Medes agaynste our cytie, whyche is their Metrip olitaine and from whence they be descended, for feare of losynge of their houses and domestycall goodes, & hadde not the hardynes to forsake their townes and Cyties, for to conserue and kepe their lybertie, as we dyd, but rather they loued better to be bondemen and subiectes of the Medes for to saue their goodes, and also to comme wyth them agaynste vs, for to brynge vs into the self seruytude and bondage. For thies reasons we haue well deserued to haue the seignyorye and rule ouer the other. For also for trouthe and wythoute anye difficultie we fournished in that same warre more ships, and shewed more harte & courage, than all the other cyties of Grece. And chiefly we desarued to haue the rule & dominyon ouer y• Ionyens, who did vnto vs the euyll that they coulde, beynge ioygned wyth the Medes. Wherefore if we desire to encrease our force agaynst the Peloponesians, and not to be more vnder the conducte and charge of others: we truly desarue to haue and obteigne Empire and lordeshyppe, as they, whyche all alone chasedde awaye the Medes,

or at the leaste for the generall lybertie, haue taken and susteigned the dangier of other, aswell as of ours, and specyally of those here. And moreouer it is lawfull & without reproche for euery man to serche his welth by all meanes that he may: which is the cause wherfore we be come hider vnto youe, knowing also that that, whyche we demande of you, ys asmuche proffytable for youe, as for vs: and for to shew you what it is, wherfore thies here do blame vs, and wherof they wold make youe afrayde. For we knowe well that those, that for feare haue suspytion of anny thynge, be ready to perswade at the begynninge by swete woordes: but afterwardes whan it cometh to the dede and busynes, than they do, as they fynd if for the beste. And in effecte we kepe and enterteigne oure Empyre and authorytie, for feare, as we haue sayde, and for the same cause we be comme hydere for to conserue oure frendes, not for to putte theym into subiectyon and seruytude, but for to defende, that othere shulde not brynge theym into theirs. And men shulde not be abalshed, that we haue made so greatte an armye for to ayde and defende our frendes, nother ought yt to be said that we wold not make to great coste for a thynge that touchethe vs but lytle. For we doo repute and thinke that whan ye shalbe of power for to resiste the Syracusains: oure estate shalbe in muche moore suertie from the Peloponesyans: for that, that they shall haue somuche the lesse succours frō the Syracusains, and that is the principall thing, for whyche youre allyaunce and amytie saruethe, for the whyche also it is reasonable and conuenyente that the Leontyns be restoredde and sette agayne into theyr howses, and that they be not subiectes, as their parentes the Eubeyans be: but puyssante for to susteigne warre agaynste the Syracusains for vs, for we be puyssance ynoughe of oureselfe for to susteigne warre in Grece agaynste oure neighbours. And the Chalcydes, who be oure subiects, and for whom thys Syracusaine blaymeth vs (sayinge that it is not to be bileued, that we be wyllinge to sette agayne into lybertie thies here, holdynge the othere in subiectyon) shall sarue vs well, for in exemptynge theym frome delyuerey of men for the warre, they shalle fournyshe vs wyth monney: and lykewyse the Leontins shalle ayde vs that be in thys countreye of Sycille and oure other allyes and frendes, chifly those, whyche lyue in lybertie. For it muste be vnderstande, that a man that ruleth by tyrannye and a cytie that hath Empire, repute nothinge dishoneste, that maye be proffytable vnto theym, and estemeth nothynge hys, that he hathe not in good suertie, and in all thynges he reputeth the othere, hys frendes or hys ennemyes accordynge to the chances and occurrantes of tymes and of affayres. Nowe it shulde not be proffytte for vs at thys present for to anoye our frendes, but rather to enterteigne them in power and authorytie, to the intent that oure ennemyes may be thereby more feoble. And thys ye may and ought to bileue by the fourme of lyuinge, which we vse with oure otherallyes in Grece. For we intreate them so, as we parceue it to be for our moste proffit. To witte, of those of Chio and of Mantinea, we take ships, and as for the reste we leaue them in their lybertie. Some other we handle more rygorously and constrayne them to paye vs monney. And some other we treate symply as frendes and allyes, and not as subiects in any other maner of thing, although that they be Islanders, & also easy to subdue for that, that they be nigh to Peloponese and by that meane lye opene to all inuasions. Wherfore by that, whych we do there, men may beleue what we wol do here, and that, for our proffit chiefly, we woll make you strōge for to kepe in feare the Syracusains, that would subdue you, and not only youe, but all the other Siciliās. Which thing they hoped to obteigne by their force orels through lacke, whiche youe shulde haue of people, if it chance that we shulde retourne

wythout doynge any thing, whyche is the thinge, wherfore they attempte and go aboute to brynge vs into suspytion wyth youe, and so it shall happene if you take theire partie. For we shall haue no more meane to passe into thies parties, seynge theym so puyssante. And wythout vs they shalbe tomuche puissante for you. And if this which we say semeth to any man not to be true, the apparāce ther of is manyfest by this, that the first time, that ye sente to vs to demāde succours, ye alleaged none other feare but that if we came not to succour you, the Syracusains wolde subdewe you, wherby afterwards we shulde be in danger. wherfore do not suffre yourself to be induced and perswaded for to perseuer in our allyāce by that same reasons, chiefly that you haue alleaged whan ye required it: nor to take suspition for that, that we be comme with a greater armye by sea, for to be more puissant against thies here, for that is a thinge vnreasonable: but ra
                     •
                  her ye oughte muche more to haue suspytion against thies here. For, as for vs, ye know well that we canne not tarye here wythoute youe. And though that we wold be euyll and vngracyous, and brynge oure frendes into oure subiection, yet coulde we not kepe them so, aswell for that, that the nauigation is farre of from Grece hither, as also that t
                     •
                  ere is muche difficultie for to kepe youre Cyties of Sycille, whiche be greate, and also haue manye people in the mayne lande. But as touchinge thies here: they be not to be feared of youe, somuche as we, for their hoste. But they be more to be feared, than our hoste, for their people, whyche be grosse. whereby beynge youre neyghbours, ye be alwayes in danger, for that, that they wayte for youe contynuelly, and be ready at all occasions to ouerronne and sett vpon youe, lyke as they haue already declared towardes many other Sycilians. but newelye agaynste the Leontyns, and yet presentlye hauynge the audacytie to encouraige youe agaynste vs, whyche be comme hyther to kepe theyme frome doynge it and from subduynge of Sycille, thinkynge youe so farre oute of youre wyttes, that youe woolde geue faythe vnto their tromperies and deceitts
                     •
                   where as we exhorte youe for your welth, both muche more truly, and more certenlye. Prayinge youe that ye lose not the proffitt that ye maye haue of one of vs, and that ye woll well chose to whyche ye maye beste truste and aboue all to consyder that thies people haue at euerye houre the meane for to subdue youe wythoute ayde of other, by the multitude of theire people. And that ye shall not haue oftentymes the meane for to chastise and brynge downe and kepe theym vnder, suche as ye haue at this present, hauing such succours of your frends and allyes. The which
                     •
                   if ye suffre to retourne wythout doing any thing, or that it be repoulsed or sente away beaten: truly the tyme wyll come that you shall wishe to haue one of the lesser parties, whā that shall proffitte youe nothing. But to the ende, that youe and the othere Syciliens do not creditt the slanders and charges that they here doo falselye laye agaynste vs, we be ryght wyllinge for to cy
                     •
                  re, painte and declare wyth the trouth the causes, wherefore men woolde brynge vs into suspytion: praying that hauing heard and vnderstanded them somarely, ye vouchesafe also to regarde and marke theyme. For we wolle not denie that we rule and gouerne some our neighbours: but as touching ye Sycilians, we be here for to defende that they shulde not be subdewed, fearyng afterwards to be endāmaged by thē, that shalbe lords ouer them. And howe muche more landes we haue for to kepe, somuch the more regarde, we be constrayned to haue to our affaires. And for this cause we be come at this time, & to ye other voyages which we haue made into this quarter, for to defēde & saue Harmeles those, yt shuld be oppressed, not of our fre wil & proper motion, but at their prayer & requeste. wherfore youe which be at thys present iudges and arbitratours of our dedes, although that it

be ryght harde for youe euene at this presente to iudge thereupon: ought not to caste of or repoulse vs, but rather herof to make youre proffytte, as ye parceyue that youe maye doo it. And to consider that this thynge shall not damage egally vnto all, but shall brynge proffytt vnto manye Grekes wythoute any damage. For throughe the puissance, whiche we haue readye, for to succoure, and reuenge the opppessedde, thoughe they be not oure subiectes, the other, that lye in wayte for theyme, and woulde do theyme violence and wronge, be forced to forbeare, and lyue in reste. And by this meane, those, whiche be in doubte to be oultraged, and wrongedde, be in suertie, wythoute annye their expense. Therefore, lordes, forsake not this suertie, whiche is comon to all those, whiche shoulde be oppressedde, and necessarye at this presente for youe, but rather wyth oure ayde, render to the Syracusayns, that whiche they haue done to other, bryngynge theyme agayne, vnto the equalitie, of their neyghbours, and sette vpon theyme sharpely, hauynge oportunytie: that ye be not alwayes in payne to defende youe, frome theyme. Thus dyd Euphemus speake? Nowe the Cameryns, were in suche disposition at that tyme, that they louedde the Athenyans, and woulde wyllynglye haue takene their parte: but for that, that they suspectedde them to be wyllynge to trouble, and vsurpe the Empire of Sycille. And as touchynge the Syracusayns althoughe that they hadde hadde difference and variance oftymes wyth theyme, for this, that they were so nygh their neyghbours: yet for that selfcause, they hadde sente vnto theyme some of their people, horsemen, to the intente, that if they hadde hadde the victorye, they shoulde not haue reprochedde theyme afterwardes, that it had bene done wythout them, and also in tyme comynge they were wyllynge for to ayde theyme, rather than the Athenyans, thoughe it were but smally. But after that the Athenyans hadde hadde the victorye, for to shewe that they estemed the sayed Syracusains no lesse, than those that had bene vainquisshed, after that they hadde consultedde and debatedde the matter amongest theyme, they made vnto theyme bothe one selfe aunswere, egall asmuche for the one as for the other. To wytt, that the warre being betwene thē that were both their allyes, they were determined not to breke their othe with the one, nor with the other, nother to geue ayde vnto aither of the parties. And vpon thys aunswere, the ambassadours departedde fromethence. In thies enterfaictes the Syracusains made all the preparasions that they coulde
                     •
                   for the warre. And as 
                     •
                  ouchynge the Athenyans they wyntredde at Naxe, and neuerthe
                     •
                  as practised by al meanes the cyties of Sycille for to drawe theym to their partie, whereof a great partie, chiefly of those, that were in the platt countrey, and that were subiectes of the Syracusains, rebelled against them. And out of the franke & free cyties, which were further in the mayne lande, they allyed theymself incontynently with the Athenians, and sent theym succours, some of monney, some of men and the other of victuailles. And of the other, that woulde not doo it of their free wyll, some were constrayned by siege, and the other they kepte that they coulde haue no succoure from the Syracusains. And during that same winter they dislodged from Naxe, and came againe vnto Catana, where they made agayn their lodging in the same place where they were bifore, which the Syracusains had burned. Being in whiche place they sente an embassade in a gelley to Carthage, for to make allyance wt them, if they coulde, & lykewise to the cyties, which be alongest the sea, Thyrrenium, wherof some did 
                     •
                  yberally graunt to make allyance with them in that same warre against the Syracusains. Moreouer they demāded of the Egesteins and of their other allyes of Sycille the greatest trowpe of horsemē, that they coulde make, & of the residue that they shuld make great prouision, of woode, of yrons &

of other thinges necessary for to make a walle bifore the cytie of Sarragosse, the whiche they were al determined for to assiege incontinently, wynter being passed.
            
            
               How the Lacedemonyans at the perswation of the Corinthians and of Alcybiades graū
                  ted to the Siracusains for to sende them succours. ☞The .xvi. Chapter.
               ON the other syde the ambassadours, which the Syracusains had despeched for to go vnto the Lacedemonyās, in passyng by the sea alongest Italie, they parforced theymselfe to allure and drawe the cyties Marytymate or by the sea syde to the allyance of the sayed Syracusayns. Shewynge them that if they suffredde the Athenyans so to prospere, they myght afterwardes be thereby in daunger. Fromethence they came to descende and lande at Corynthe where they declared their charge, which was in effect, for to pray them, that, as their parentes and cousyns, they woulde sende them succours, whiche thynge they graunted theym redely and bifore all the Grekes, and ordeyned ambassadours for to go with them to the Lacedemonyans and for to perswade them to begynne warre afreshe agaynste the Athenyans, and to sende succours to the sayd Syracusayns. And so they altogiders came to Lacedemonie. At whiche place, sone after aryued Alcibiades and the other bannysshed out of Athens, who came to Cylene in the countrey of Eliens, frome Thurie, where they furste aboorded, and fromethence to Lacedemonie vnder suertie and saulfconduct of the Lacedemonyens, who had willed hym to come vnto them. Without which suertie, he feared to come thider for the treatie, that he had made with the Mantynyens. So it chaunced that the counsaille of the Lacedemonyans being assembled, the Corynthians, the Syracusains, and Alcibiades dydde declare and speake all to one selfe ende. And forsomuche as the sayed Lacedemonyans, though that they were wyllyng to sende an ambassade to the Syracusayns for to empesche and lett them to take partie with the Athenyans, were neuerthelas not wyllynge for to sende them any succours: The same Alcibiades for to moue and stirre theyme to that affaire, did speake to theyme in this manner.
               
                  The Oration of Alcibiades the Athenian to the Lacedemonyans.
                  IT is nedeful, Lordes Lacedemonians, bifore that I propone or declare other matters, to speake of that, whe
                        •
                     wt I may be charged. For if you holde me suspected by reason therof, ye woll not geue fayth nor creditt my wordes speaking of the comon Welth. My progenitours, hauing by occasiō of certene accusation renoūced the fredome and ciuilitie of thys your cytie, I haue sithens had wylle to recouer yt, and for cause thereof, haue honored and saruedde youe in manye thynges, but amonge other in the losse, that youe hadde at Pylus. And I perseueringe in this affection towardes your cytie, ye made the appoynctment wyth the Athenyans, by meane wherof ye encreased the puissance of my enemyes, and dyd vnto me greate dishonnoure, whiche was the thynge, wherefore I wythdrewe my selfe vnto the Mantynyens and the Argiues, wyth whome beinge bicome your ennemy, I did endomage you wherein that I might
                        •
                      And if any amōgest you hated me against reason, that I than dyd hurte you, truly he oughte nowe to forbeare and cease, if he consider the thynges well. And if any other haue euil opynion of me, forsomuch as I haue susteigned and defended the estate and gouernemente of the common people, he hathe lesse

reasone for to hate or suspecte me for that, for we other Athenyans be alwayes contrarye and ennemyes of tyrantes. Nowe all that, whiche contraryeth or ys agaynst them, ys the comon people, for this cause the comon auctorytie hath alwayes remayned amonge vs, and durynge the same I haue oftymes bene constrayned to followe the time. And neuerthelas I haue contynually takene payne for to moderate and refrayne the lycence and audacytie of them, that woulde against the fourme of reasone, conduct and order thynges at their wylle, for that, that there haue alwayes bene in tyme paste, and yet presently be some, men that haue seduced the comon people, in perswading them vnto that, that was for the woorst. Whiche be those, that haue chased and dryuene me away, although that in the tyme, that I haue had auctorytie, I haue alwayes counsailledde and perswaded good thinges, & that, which I had learned to be for the best, to the ende to conserue the citie in lybertie, and prosperitie lyke as they haue founde it. For all they that haue knowlaige of the comon estate, knowe what it is, but yet I, who haue al wayes despised and abhorred yt, knowe more therof. And if it were nedefull to speake of the madnes and rashnes of it, I would tel nothyng therof, which hath not bene experymented: but it semed not to me to be a thinge right suer for to enterpryse to wyll to change it, being by you assieged and warred against. And this is ynough spokene of the thynges, that may engender suspition and hate of me towardes youe. Therefore I wyll nowe speake of the affaires, whereupon ye ought presently to deuyse. Wherein if I vnderstande annye thynge further than youe, whereof it be nedefulle to aduertise youe, ye shall therein pronounce iudgemente. We be gone to Sycylle in purpose furste to subdue yt, if we maye, and after those there, the Italians, and also that done, for to essay to rule and gouerne the allyes of the Chartagyans, and theymselfes also if we may. And if that were come to oure intente in all or for a good parte, than we would come to conquere and subdue Peloponese, hauynge in oure ayde and seruice, all the Grekes that be in the countreis of Sycille, and of Italie, wyth greate nomber of estrangers and barbarous people, whiche we shoulde haue hadde in soulde or wages, and specyally of the Iberyens, who be wythout annye doubt at this present the best warryours, that be in that same quarter. And on the other parte we woulde haue made greate nomber of galleys in the quarter of Italie, where there ys greate quantytie of woode and of other stuffe, for to make theyme, to the ende that we myght holde the sayd countrey of Peloponese assieged, aswell by the sea with the sayd gallyes, as also by lande wyth our foote men, trustynge to take parte of the cyties of the same countrey by force, and the other by lengthe of siege, whyche thynge semed to vs very assured. And hauynge subdewed the sayed countrey, we hoped easely and ryght sone to obteigne the Empire and seigniorye of all Grece, causyng the sayd landes by vs conquered to fournyshe vs wt monney and victualles besydes the reuenue whiche hath bene leuied in theis parties. Nowe youe haue vnderstande of the armye by sea, that is in Sycille, which thing is shewed vnto you by a man that knoweth fully and holy oure endes and ententes. The whiche though I be departed fromethence the other Dukes & capytaynes woll put in execution if they can. And if you do not withstande it, I perceyue nothyng there that maye empesche them, insomuche as the Syciliens be not accustomed to warre. And yet neuerthelas whan they be ioigned alll togiders, they maye resist and eskape. But the Syracusains, who haue bene al vainquished in battaile, and cannot nowe saille by sea, may not alone resist & withstande the hoste of the Athenyens, whiche presentlye is there. And if this cytie were taken, all Sycille shoulde afterwars be sone subdewed, yea and consequently, Italie. That done,

the danger, whereof I haue made mencyon vnto youe shall not be farre of from you, nor so retarded or slacked that you shall not perceyue yt commyng. Wherefore none of youe ought to perswade hymselfe that this question is for Sycille onely. For wythoute doubte, the question and varyance ys for Peloponese
                        •
                      yf ye doo not readely prouyde for it. And for to do that, it is requisitte to sende ryghte sone thider an armye by sea, in the whiche the veray maroners oughte to be warryours. And that whiche is pryncipall, that there be for capytayne, a couragious man of Sparte. For the presence of hym shalbe for to enterteigne in youre amytie, those that be there at thys presente, and for to constrayne the other, there. For that, that they, which be youre frendes, shall haue by this doyng more hope, and those, that be in wauerynge or doubte, shall haue lesser feare to comme to youre allyance. And moreouer ye ought most openly to begyn warre against the Athenynans. For in that doinge, the Syracusayns shall knowe, that ye care and be myndefulle for their affaire. By occasion whereof, they shall take more couraige for to resist, and the Athenyans shall haue the lesser meane for to sende succours to their people, whiche bene there. And also me thynketh, that ye oughte to take and to fortefye soubdainely wyth walles the towne of De
                        •
                     elea, whiche is in the terrytorye of Athens, insomuche as it 
                        •
                     s the thyng, that the Athenyans do most feare. And yet neuerthelas it is the onely towne, wherof no parte hath bene touched, durynge all this warre. And truly a man cannot endomage hys ennemye more greatly, than to doo that vnto hym, whiche he perceyueth, that he feareth most, for it is to be bileued, that euerye man knoweth and feareth those thinges, which may be most preiudiciall, & hurtfull vnto hym. And therfore I wolle geue you to vnderstande the proffytt, that shalbe yours by enclosyng the sayd towne with walles, and the dommage that it shall bryng vnto your ennemyes. And also I will shewe onely the most waighty therof sommarely or in fewe woordes. That is, that whan ye shall haue fortefied that same place wtin our lande, many of our townes shall rendre both themself vnto you, & also ye shall take the other more easely. And moreouer, the reuenue whiche we perceyue of the mynes of syluer at Laurium, & the other reuenues that are taken aswell of the lāde, as of the Iurisdictiō shall ceasse, and specially those, which we do leuie of our frendes, who perceiuing you to come againste vs with all youre strength, wille praise vs very smally. All which thinges be in your power for to cause to come readely to effect, yf you woll, for yt, that I thinke not to erre in this matter, but that they may be easely done. And none of you ought to blame me nother to repute me euill, if hauyng bene hertofore your great ennemy and chief or capytaine of oure people: I come and speake nowe bitterly against the comon weale of my countrey, nother also to suspect me, nor to preseume that the same, whiche I say, is for to acquire and gett your fauour, bicause of my bannishment. And I am exiled for trouth, & it is through the malice and naughtynes of theym that hate me, but it shall not be to your domage, if ye woll bileue me. And I ought not to repute youe at thys present somuche my ennemyes, who, sometime being our ennemyes, haue endomaged vs: as those, which haue constrayned my frendes to be my ennemyes, not nowe as I am oultraged & wronged: but than whan I had auctorytie ouer the people, wherfore being by them chased out of my coūtrey, I recoen that I do no longer against it as mine, but rather I thinke y• I laboure rather to recouer that whiche no more is mine. For he ought to be more truly reputed the louer of his countrey: whiche for the desire that he hath to recouer yt, doth all that he canne, for to retourne thider: than he, that beinge vniustly chased fromethence, dare not goo for to inuade yt. For the whyche reasons I repute my selfe suche (Lordes

                      ye ought to sarue yourselues in all dangers and in all trauailes. For you knowe that it ys a comon prouerbe, that he, which beinge ennemye doth endomage: if it becometh frende

                      may also proffyt. And somuche the more, for that I knowe the affaires of Athens, and also do well nygh vnderstande yours by coniecture. Therefore I requyre youe insomuche as there is question of thinges, which be of so great importance, that it greue you not for to enterpryse, to reyse, and leuye twoo armyes, the one by sea, for to go into Sycille, and the other by lande, for to go into the countrey of Athens. By which doyng, ye may with a small puissance atteigne great thynges in Sycille, and clerely subuerte the puissance of the Athenyans aswell present as for to come, whereby your estate shalbe herafter bothe in whole and all suertie, and also ye shall haue the superyorytie ouer all Grece: not by constraincte, but wyllyngly. After that Alcibiades hadde thus spokene, the Lacedemonyans, who, wythout that, had already purposed to make warre agaynst the Athenyans (though that they wente about delayingly & were not fully resolued) were by the sayd declarations greatly establyshed in that same opynion, presupposing that they had bene aduertised of all thynges accordynge to the trouthe, by hym that knewe yt welle. And so fromthensforth they conceyued in their fantasie for to take and fortefie Decelea, and for to sende incontynently some succours, into Sycile, and dydde chose Gylippus, sonne of Cleander, for chief of that same enterpryse, to whome they commanded that he shulde treate with the ambassadours, of the Syracusayns and with the Corinthians. And by their aduise, he launched & sailled fourth, with the best, and most soubdaine and ready succours that he coulde gett, and didde geue order to the Corynthyans that they shoulde sende theyme twoo galleys fourhwith vnto Asine, and moreouer that they shulde putt the other (whiche they had appoyncted to sende) in estate to make saille as sone as they coulde, so that they myght be ready: whan that it shulde be tyme to saille. And vpon this determynation the ambassadours departed from Lacedemonie. In thies enterfaictes the galley whiche the Dukes Athenyans had sente frome Sycille vnto Athens, for to demande renforte or newe succours of victuailes, of men and of monney: aryued. And they, that were come, hauynge expounded and declared their charge, yt was ordeyned that the said newe succours shulde be sent, and in that meane time drewe nere the ende of the wynter, whiche was the .xvii. yeare o

Chapter.
               AT begynnyge of the sprynge tyme, the Dukes Athenyans, that were at Catana departed and sailled to Megare, that is in Sycille, which the Syracusayns dydde holde. But after that the cytizeins were chasedde fromethence, vnder Selon the tyrante,Selon

the countrey, and wente fromethence to assawlte a castelle whiche was there by, thynkynge to haue rasedde it downe. But seynge that they coulde not, they retyred to the ryuer of Tyrea,Terea. whiche they passed and pillaged lykewyse of the platt countrey that was on the other syde of that same ryuer

                  tredde in their waye, and afterwardes they reysedde vp their Trophe in signe of victory. And that done they embarquedde theymself agayne, and retournedde fromethence to Catane, where they made prouision of victuailles, and afterwardes they departed fromethence agaynst a towne of Sycille named Centoripia,Centoripia. wherinto they were receyued by appoynctmente, and at their yssuynge fourthe fromethence burned the corne of the Teynessians, and Hybleans, and retournedde agayne to Catane, where they founde two houndred men at Armes, without that, that they hadde any horses: but onely the harnnes, & accoustremetes, or apparell for horse (thinking that the countrey of Sytille shulde haue furnished horses) and thirtye Arbalestriers on horsebacke, togiders wt three hoūdred talentes of monney: which was sent vnto them, frō Athens. That same yeare, the Lacedemonyans, hauing made an army against the Argiues, as they were in the felde for to go against Cleonarus,Cleonarus. there came soubdainly an earthquake, whiche caused theym to retourne fromethence. Which perceiued by the Argiues, after that the other were retourned, they yssued fourth into the territory of Thyree,Thyrea which is in their fronture, & pillaginge yt, the butye was so great, that yt was solde for .xxv. talentes & more. In that same seasō, the comons of Thespie did arise against the officers.Thespia But the Athenyās sent incōtinently of their people thider, who did take one parte of the Mutyns or sedicious parsons, & on other parte fledde fromthence vnto Athens. During that same somer, the Syracusains, beynge aduertised that the succours of horsemen were come to the Athenyans, & thinking that hauing the same they would incōtinētly come to assiege them: aduysed & remembred that there was a verye lytle fro the towne, a place named, Epipole,Epipole which was hāging frō al sydes against the towne. But aboue, it was playne and spacious, and there was but certene entrynges, by whiche men myght mount vp. whereupon considerynge that it was impossible for to close yt wyth walle, rounde aboutes, and also that if the ennemyes did gett yt, they myght fromthence do many enylles into the towne: they determyned to fournishe the entringes, for to defende that the sayd ennemyes shulde not take them. And so the morowe folowyng they moustred all the people bifore all the compaignions & Collegues, of Hermocrates in a meadowe that is nigh the ryuer, which is called,Anapus Anapes

Of whome they gaue charge to Dyonulus bannisshed out of Andrie, and sayd vnto hym that if annye thing chaunced in that affaire, he shulde be incontinently succoured. That same night, the Athenyans hauyng made a reuiewe of their men, aboute br

And on thoder syde the armye by sea, came to ancre and bestowe themeselefe vnder a rocky place of the sea, that is in a small straight, whiche doth enter into the sea, and is enuyroned on all sydes, resaruedde one smalle quarter towardes the lande, and that same place is calledde Thapsus,Thapsus. & is very nigh to Sarragosse. And so they enclosed incontinently, the entring that leadeth to lande, wyth paales or boordes for to be in suertie on the lande syde. That done, those
                     •
                   that were landed, dyd come in a great course vnto Epipole, and gott yt, bifore that the Syxe houndredde men,

whyche were appoynctedde for to goo thider: were there, for yett they were all on foote, where the moustre was made. And yet neuerthelas one greate partie of the people dydde ronne for to succoure the sayedde place, but pryncipally the Syxe houndred, whereof Dionulus hadde charge, and he wyth theyme. Nowe there was frome that same foote, vntyll the place where the ennemyes alreadye were, aboutes .xxv. stades, so they were receyuedde by the ennemyes, and repoulsedde in suche manner, that they were constraynedde for to retyre into the cytye, and there were slayne of theyme aboute three houndred, amongeste the whyche, was Dyonulus, whose Corpses the Syracusayns demaunded, & by that meane confessedde the victorye vnto the ennemyes. Who, hauynge reysed vp there, their Trophee, the morowe after came to present and offer battaile bifore the towne. But seynge that none yssuedde fourthe, they reysedde and erected a castell in the toppe of Epipole in a a place, called Lapdalum,Lapdalum. whyche is on the coaste of Megare, for to wythdrawe thyder all their vesselles, monney and baguage, whan they yssued aither against the towne, or to make any worke. And sone after three houndred horsemen came vnto theym frome Egeste, and aboute one houndred frome the Naxians and other Sycillians, and they had alreadye of their oune, twoo houndred and fyftie, whiche had recoueredde horses, aswell of the Egestain guifte, as in other places for monney and so they had in all sixe houndred and fyftie horses. Hauyng than put garnysone wythin Lapdalum, they went fromthence agaynste Syca,Syca. the whyche wythin verye smalle tyme they enclosed wyth walles

                   whereof and of their greate diligence, the Syracusayns were all astonyedde. Neuerthelas for to shewe that they were not afrayde, they yssued out of the cytye into the felde for to presente battaylle to the ennemyes. But their Capytaynes, parceiuing that they were in disorder, and that it was harde for to bring theyme agayne into order, caused theyme to retyre into the towne, excepte one parte of their horsemen, that remayned wythoute for to empesche and lette the Athenyans to gather stones and othere stuffe for to make the walle, and also that they shoulde not ouercome the countrey. But the horsemen Athenyans to

                  ider with a bende of foote men assailled theym and dyd put them to flyght, and slewe a certaine nomber of them, wherupon for cause of the sayd victory, they sett vp yet an other Trophee. The daye followynge, the Athenyans, beinge in their campe, some of theym wete busyed in makyng the walle on the South syde, and some other gathered togiders stoanes & other stuffe, nighe the place called Trogylum, and wente laying and dischargyng yt alwayes in that quarter, where the walle was lowest, from the greatest porte vnto the othere sea. Which parceyued by the Syracusains, they determyned for to yssue no more altogiders agaynste their ennemyes, mynding not to hazarde tomuche. But they purposed to make and reyse vp an rampare wythoute the walle of the towne in the quarter, where the Athenyans reysed vp their walle. For it semed vnto them that if they myght haue sonner parfaicted and ended their sayd rampare for to repoulse their ennemyes, than they their wall, hauing therin put their good warde and watche: they might sende parte of their men for to wyn & get the entringes, and afterwardes to fournishe them, whiche doing they thought that it might be that the Atheniās shulde ceasle their worke for to come altogiders against them. So they did yssue fourth of the citie & began to labour at their rāpare, beginning frō the wall of the towne & continuing al alongest that same of thennemyes. For making of whiche worke they cutt downe greate quantitie of Olyue trees within the courte of the temple, whereof also they made towers vpon the said rampare. For they yet did kepe the quarter towardes the sea, for yt, that the Athenyans had not yett caused

their shyppes to come oute of Thapsus, into the great poorte, out of the whiche place of Thapsus, they causedde to be brought by lande vyttuailles, and othere thynges necessarye. The Syracusayns hauynge than parfaycted their rampare, without that the Athenyans had done thē any empeschement or lett (forsomuch as they had lettes ynoughe by makynge their walle, and also feared that if they shulde attende and geue themself vnto two busynesses, they might be repoulsed) they retyred into the cytie, and lefte a nomber of people for to kepe the rampare. On the other syde the Athenyans dyd breake the conductes, by which the water entred into the towne. And on the other parte hauinge espyed that of the Syracusains, that were left for to kepe the rampare, some of them at highe none time retyred into their pauillions, some wente into the cytie, and the other that taryed in the sayed rampare, did kepe very yll watche, they ordeyned three houndred of the most chosene of their people on foote, well armedde, and a certeine nomber of the beste lyghtly armedde, for to go to assaille the sayd rampare. And in one selfe instan
                     •
                  e, they parted all the army into twoo partes, aither partie hauing his capytaine, wherof the one wente againste the cytie for to repoulse the cytizeins yf they would haue yssued fourth for to succour their people, and the other agaynste the rāpare on the syde of the small poorte named Pyramyde. The affaire beyng thus ordeyned, the three houndred whiche hadde charge for to assawlte the rampare, did take it, for they that shulde haue kept it, did habandone it, and retyred to the wall, whiche was nigh vnto the temple, who were followed so nigh by the Athenyans, that they entred one with an other in with them. But they were sone chased away againe by those of the towne, which came to the succours. In which cō
                  flict, some Athenyans and Argiues were sla

                  ne, & the other in retyryng, dyd rase and breake downe the rampare & caryed away the wood that they might carry with them into their campe. Afterwardes they raysed vp an Trophee in tokene of that same victory. The day following they enclosed with wall a rocke cut out of stoane, whiche was in the place of Epipole, aboue ouer a marreys, out of the which men might see into the greate porte, and they extended and dyd drawe the same wal from the rocke along from the plaine & from the marreys vnto the sea, Which perceiued by the Syracusains, they yssued fourth agayne for to make in the opposite or directly agaynst it a rampare, with pales & dyches for to empesche that the ennemyes might not extende their wall. Who hauing acheued their wall about the rocke, determyned for to assaille ones againe those that laboured at the rampare & at the dyche. And so cōmanded the capytaine of the shipps, that he shulde gouerne them from Thapsus into the great poorte. And they at the breake of the day descended from Epipole, and came to trauerse & passe ouer the plaine, which was at the fote therof, & fromthence, the marreys, in that part therof, that was most drye, with dores and hardelles that they caste aboue for to susteigne and kepe them from synkyng, in suche sorte that they dyd wynne agayne the rampare and the dyche frome the Syracusains, resaruedde a certene small parte therof, and vainquished those, that were commytted to the kepynge of yt, whereupon those, whiche were in the ryght poyncte retyred into the towne and the other towardes the ryuer. But the three houndred footemen, that had bene chosene to assaille theyme (as at the other tyme) wyllyng to enclose theyme, prepared theymeselfe to runne with all their force agaynste the brydge of the ryuer, which parceiued by the Syracusains (among whome there was a good nomber of horsemen, they made straight against the sayd three houndred, and repoulsed them. Afterwardes they charged vpon the ryght poynct of the Athenyans, with suche strength, that they, which were in the former rencke were afrayde. But Lymachus

who was in the lefte poyncte, seyng the danger came to succoure them, hauing a certene nomber of shoters or slingers and Argiues

                  aryed them beyonde the ryuer into a suer place, bifore that that they might haue bene recouered, but the other were so diligente yt they were forced to leaue them. In the meane tyme, those, whiche at begynning were fledde into the towne, seynge the defence, that the other vsed, they toke harte againe, and yssued fourth in the battaille against the Athenyans, & sent a nomber of them agaynst the wall, whiche the Athenyans had made about Epipole, thinking that there had bene no warde, as for trouth there was not, whereby it happened that they dydde gette asmuche of the walle as was made in tenne dayes, and hadde gottene the reste, if Nycyas had not soubdainely come to the succours of it, who was lefte there, for that, that he was yll disposedde. The same man perceyuynge that there was no remedye for to kepe and defende the walle for lacke of men, he commaundedde hys seruauntes to putt fyer into the woode and matter that was sette bifore the walle, and by that meane, the reste therof was saued. For the Syracusayns durste passe no further bycause of the fyer. Seynge also the Athenyans, that hadde chased awaye the other bende of theirs, to come ronnynge agaynste theyme, and moreouer that the shyppes that came oute fro Thapsus were alreadye entredde into the poorte: knowynge also that they were not puissante for to resiste the Athenyans, nor for to empesche and lett theym, that they shoulde not fynyshe their walle, they retyredde into the sea. And that done, the Athenyans dydde agayne reyse vp there an othere Trophee, for that, that the Syracusayns confessedde and grauntedde theyme the vyctory, by demandynge the Cariongs, and Corpses of the deade, whyche were rendredde to theyme. Amongeste whome was Lamachus, and those that hadde bene slayne wyth hym. All the armye of the Athenyans aswelle by sea, as by lande beynge than aboorded, they enclosed the cytye wyth a double walle, frome Epipole vntylle the sea. And they beyng there, plentye of victuailles was brought vnto them from all coastes o
                     •
                   Italie. And manye allyes of the Syracusayns, whiche at the begynnynge had refused to ioigne wyth those Athenyans, came to render theymself vnto theym and from the coaste of the sea Thirrenium, there came vnto theym three galleis wyth newe strength, whereby the affaires were in suche estate, that they assured theymeselfe for to haue the victorye, considered speciallye that the Syracusayns hadde no more hope to be of power for to resist, nother by force nor by the fight, not hauynge newes that annye succours shoulde comme vnto theyme oute of Peloponese. So they had manye parlementes aswelle amonge theymeself, as also wyth Nycyas (who, after the deathe of Lamachus remaynedde onely Capytayne of the Athenyans) for to enter into some treatie with the sayd Athenians, yett was there nothynge therein done nor concludedde: althoughe that manye woordes thereupon hadde bene spokene, lyke as yt is to be beleued to be, among people that be ambiguous or doubtefulle and that perceyue theymselfe assieged and oppressedde more and more. And that aswelle wyth Nycyas, as the one to the othere, forsomuche as by cause of the necessyties, wherein they were, the one mystrustedde the othere.

at Leucade wyth the Corynthyans shyppes, fully determyned to come with all diligence to succour the Syracusayns. But beyng aduertised that the cytie was already enclosed on all sydes, by many that agrede all therupon (though that it were not trewe) he loste both hope and fantasie of the affaires of Sicille. And yet neuerthelas for to saue Italie, he saylledde fromethence wyth two galleys with Lacedemonyans, and wyth hym Pythus Corynthien with twoo other galleys of Corynthe, wyth all diligence to Tarente. And the Corynthyans saylledde after more softely wyth tenne other of their galleys, twoo of Leucadyans, and .iii. of Ambracians. Gylippus than beynge arryuedde in the poorte of Tarente, he wente fromethence into the Cytie of Thurie, as Ambassadoure of the Peloponesians for to wythdrawe and brynge theyme vnto theyr allyance, bryngynge hys father to their remembrance, who hadde sometyme gouernedde their estate, but seynge that they would not thereunto consente, he retourned fromethence alongeste Italie, and whan he was in the Goulphe of Terynee, there came vpon him a southe wynde, whereunto that same Goulphe is greately subiected, so that he was by force constrayned to retourne into the porte of Tarente, into the which he wythdrewe hys shyppes, and repayred those whiche had bene bruised by fortune of the sea. Nycyas was aduertysed of the coming of Gylyppus, who vnderstanding the small nomber of shyppes that he had with him, passed not of them, lyke as also ye Thuryans had not done. And it semed to hym that he was rather comme as a Corsaire or Pyrate for to pyllage in the sea, than for to succoure the Syracusains. In that same somer the Lacedemonyans with their allyes began warre agaynst the Argyues, and pillaiged one parte of their lande, vnto whome the Athenyans sent thyrtye shyppes wyth succours. And by that meane did euydently breake the treatie whiche they had not bifore done. For the inroades and pillages, that they had made vnto that same houre, were more in māner of theft, than of warre. And they were not willing to ioigne with the Argyues and Mantynyans agaynst the Lacedemonyans. But rather, though that they had many times bene sore laboured vnto by the Argyues for to enter in armure with them into the lande of Laconie, at the least that same, which they helde, and for to pillaige a certaine small quarter of that, the which the Lacedemonyans dyd holde, and afterwardes to retourne fromethence wythout doyng anny otherthyng: yet they had neuer bene wyllyng to agree or consent vnto it. But than hauing made three chiefes and capytaynes of their armye, to witte Pythodorus,Pythodorus. Lespodius,Lespodius. and Damarathus,Damaratus. they entred into the countrey of Epidaure ennemylyke, & pillaged Lymere,Limera Prassie & some other smal townes of that same quarter.Prassie. Wherby the Lacedemonyans had afterwardes more lawfull excuse to declare theymself their ennemyes. After that the Athenyans were retourned from Argos with their army by sea, and the Lacedemonyans with theirs by lande, the Argiues wente to ouerronne, the lande of Phliasie. A

And fynally they arrestedde and concluded to go to Imera,Imera. specially being aduertised that the foore Athenyans shyppes, whiche Nycyas had sente, were not yet arryuedde at Rhege, whiche Nycyas hadde sent thider, vnderstāding that those same were yet at Locres. So Gylyppus & Pythan wyth their shyppes passed the distreate, bifore that the other were arryuedde at Rhege. And afterwardes saillynge alongeste frome Missena they came directlye vnto Imera. Beynge aryued in whiche place, they intreated and perswaded the Imerens to enter into their allyance, and to fournyshe them with shyppes, and harnois for their men, that lacked it. And afterwardts they sente vnto the Selynuntyns, that they shulde be in a certene place, that they named vnto them, assuring them, one bende (not very great) of their people to go with thē. It happened also that the Gelians & some other Sycilliens were the more encouraiged for to enter into this allyance of the Peloponesyens, than they had bene bifore time, for that, that Archonides,Archonides. who had gouernedde some of those Syciliens, was dead a small tyme bifore, who in his lyfe tyme, hadde great amytie, confederation and intelligence wyth the Athenyans, and also for the bruyte whiche was, that Gylippus came diligently & manfully wyth hys people to the succours of the Syracusayns, who hauyng taken aboutes seuene houndred of his oune men, aswel souldiars, as maroners which he had armed, a thousande Imeryens aswell wel armed, as lightly armed, & a houndred horsemen, a certene nomber of Selinuntyns all horsemen or lightly armed and also a ryght small nomber of Gelyens, wyth some other Syciliens to the nomber of a thousande: marched towardes Sarragosse.

Amongest whome, the same, whereof Gongylus was Capytaine,Gongylus. arryued first at Sarragosse, although that he was the last that departed. And sone after arryuedde Gylippus, who vnderstandynge that the Syracusayns were in doubte for to enter in treatie with the Athenyans: aduertised them of the succours, wherof they were ryght ioyfulll & all recomforted.

And of the other syde towardes Trogile, they hadde alreadye broughte plenty of stoanes and othere stuffe and in some place acheued & fynysshed their worke, in some place halfe sett it vp, and in an other place there was nothynge done from the begynnynge, for that, that on that syde the largenes was so great. In suche danger were already the Syracusains, whan the succours came vnto them. The Athenyans than perceiuing Gylippus and the Syracusains to come so soubdainly againste them, they were at begynninge afrayde, neuerthelas they afterwardes recouered their couraige, and came all in battayle agaynste thennemyes. But bifore that they approched, Gylippus sente an heraulte for to declare vnto theyme, that if they woulde departe out of Sycille wythin fyue dayes, he was contente to make treatie wyth them. Which thynge the Athenyans regardedde not, but sente agayne the heraulte wythoute annye aunswere. Than both parties preparedde theymeself to come to battaile, But Gylippus, seynge that the Syracusayns were in disorder: & that he coulde not welle brynge theyme into renckes, he deuysedde for the beste to wythdrawe theyme into a place more spacious. Nycyas also on the other syde caused not his people to marche fourthe, but rather made theyme to kepe all in bataylle ray vpon their walles and rampares. Whiche perceyuedde, Gylyppus retyred wyth hys people into a mounte named Temenitie where he lodgedde hys campe.Temenites. And the morowe after he conductedde the greateste partie of hys men in battaylle euene harde to the walles of the Athenyans, for to defende that the one shoulde not succoure the othere.

                  dalum, the whiche they dydde take and slewe all those, that they founde within, without this, that the other Atheniās coulde parceyue any thyng therof. And the same day the Syracusayns toke a galley of the Athenyans, as it would haue entred into the greate porte. After that, the Syracusayns begonne a walle from the cytie vntil the heigh of Epipole. And they reysed an other fromthence ouerthwart that same of the Athenyans, for to lett and defende thē (if they would suffer theyme to acheue and fynyshe it) frome enuironynge and enclosynge the towne on all sydes. But they hauynge acheued the walle, whiche they determyned to make fro their campe vnto the sea, were retyredde into their forte in the vppermoste parte. But for that, that one parte of their walle was lowe, Gylyppus wente wyth hys people in the night, thynkinge to take it, neuerthelas being perceyued by them whiche warded yt, who kept their watche wythout, and mett hym, retyred softely wythout makynge any noyse. And afterwardes the Athenyans did heighthen the sayed wall, & appoincted their oune people to the warding thereof, and those of their allyes vnto other places. It semedde moreouer vnto Nycias to be expedient to enclose wyth wall the place, that is called Plēmyryū,Plemmyriū. whiche is a rocke in the promontorie foreanempste the cytie, the whiche entreth into the sea, and commeth vnto the entrynge of the great poorte. For it semedde vnto him that if he had fortefyed it, the victuailles & other thynges that came

by sea, myght come more easely, hauynge garnysone so nyghe vnto the poorte, where as at that houre they coulde not abyde, but afarre of fromthence. Wherby yf any alarme shulde chance to be made on the sea syde, they coulde not so sone come vnto the succours. And that dyd he, intendynge to ayde hymself moore wyth the armye by sea, than wythe that same by lande, sythens that Gylippus was come. And so he charged one partie of his armye into hys ships, & brought them to the sayde place, whyche he caused to be enclosed and fortefyed with thre walles and rampares: and afterwardes he bestowed one parte of hys baggage there: and vndernethe the same they myghte wythdrawe hys shyppes bothe great and small: by occasyon wherof many of hys maronners fromthence forwardes, through faulte of freshe water, did dye, for that, that they were forcedde to fatche their water afarre of, and moreouer whan they issuedde fourthe to fatche woode, the horsemen Syracusains, that kepte the teldes, dyddeslaye them, specyallye those that were in a towne in Olympus, the whyche were placedde there for to defende that the Athenyans, whyche were in the sayd place of Plemmyrum shulde do no hurte.

In the meane tyme Gylippus caused lykewyse the walle betwene the Cytie and Epipole, to be reysed and fynyshed, and for to make yt, he aydeth hymselfe wyth the suffre, whyche the Athenyans had for themself gathered togyther. And that done, he issued many tymes out of the cytie wyth hys people and wythe the Syracusayns in battaille. And the Athenyans on the other syde did the lyke. And whan it semed vnto him, to be tyme to assaille, he went furste for to charge vpon them. But insomuch as the combate and fighting was amonge the rāpares of both partes, whych was a place nothyng easy for the horsmen, wherof the Syracusains had great nomber: the Syracusains and Peloponesians were vainquished. For the which victorie, the Athenyans, hauyng rendred the dead, reysed and sett vp a Trophee.
               
                  An Oration and ouerthwarte declaration of Gylippus vnto his souldyars and men at armes.
                  NEuerthelas Gylippus, aftere that same battaille, assembledde the men of warre, and shewed them, that the losse chaunced not through their faulte, but rather through his, forsomuche as he had takene frō them the ayde of their horsmē and of their Casters of dartes, causing them to fyght in one so strayte a place, wherein they coulde not helpe themselfe, wherefore he was determyned to cause theym for to issue a freshe to fyghte in a place more reasonable, prayinge them to remember that they were Doryens & Peloponesyans, and that it shulde be their greate shame to be vaynquished and chased by the Ionyans and Islanders and other people gathered togiders oute of all sortes, beinge in as great nōber, as they. And afterwards whan he thought it tyme, he ledde them fourthe agayne to battaylle. Nycias also had determyned, if they wolde not haue issuedde fourth to haue gone to presente theym battaille. For he was determyned not to suffre them to fynishe their rampares and wals that they made nygh vnto theirs: the whyche were already so farre forwardes, as thiers, and they parceyued well that if they suffredde that they shulde extende them further, those same Athenyans shulde be more assieged by the Syracusains, than the Syracusains by theym, and in danger to be vainquished. Therfore

he likewise yssued fourth to the battaille. Nowe Gylippus had ordeynedde his horsmen & casters of darts to be more further

                     ious place, where the walles and rampares on both sydes failled from the coast of thennemyes. Who after the battaill was begonne, came to russhe and charge vpon the lefte poinct of the Athenyans and put them to flyght: wherby it chanced that the Syracusains and Peloponesians, had the victorie, for that, that the other partie, seinge the Athenyans flye dyd the lyke, & wythdrewe themself into their fortes and holdes. And the nyghte ensuynge, the Syracusains made their walle egall with the same of thennemyes, and yet further and greatter, so that the ennemyes coulde not empesche nor lette them, but that they myghte make and extende their sayd wall, so farre and so large as they woolde, and though afterwardes they had bene vainquished in battail, yet could they be no more enclosed wyth walle. Sone after arryued the shipps of the Corynthians, of the Leucadyans, and of the Ambracians, to the nomber of twelue, wherof Thrasonides the Corynthian was chief,Thrasonides, who had deceyued the Atheniās shippes that came to rencounter theym, and ayded the Syracusayns to fynyshe their walle, whyche they hadde begonne vnto the same, that came ouerthwarte yt. That done Gylippus, perceyuing the towne to be in suertie, did go fromthēce through the other cyties of Sycille, practisinge thē to enter into allyance against the Athenyans, those, that were in doubte, or that vtterly abhorredde the warre. And besydes thys the Syracusains and the Corynthians that were comme to their ayde, sente Ambassadours to Lacedemonye, and to Corynthe to haue newe succours, in whatsoeuer manner that they myght: were it in galleys, in Barques or other shipps, what that they were, so that they brought men of warre. On the other syde the Syracusains, presupposinge that the Athenyans woolde lykewise sende some newe succours to their campe equipped and tacled their shyppes for to fyght with them by sea, and made all necessary preparatyons for warre. Whiche parceyued by Nycias, and that the force and strength of hys ennemyes dyd daylly increase, and hys decrease and lessene: he determyned lykewyse for to sende to Athens to do them to vnderstande the estate, wherin they were in the campe: whyche was suche, that he reputed them to be but vainquished and destroyed, if ayther that they were not caused to retyre, orels that succours were sente vnto them so puissante and mighty, as they were. And

And so the Ambassadours wente fromthence wyth hys letters and instructions vnto Athens. And in the meane time Nycias toke more care and studie to warde & kepe his campe, than for to go to assaille hys ennemyes. In that same somer Euetion Athenyan Duke w

               The tenour of the letters of Nycias to the Athenyans, and the prouysion that they had made vpon the contenue of the same. ☞The seconde Chapter.
               YOue haue bene aduertised (lordes Athenyans) by our former letters of all that, whych before tyme hath chaunced in thies quarters. And presently I ryght hartely requyre you to vouchesaulfe to be infourmed of the estate wherin we be, for to determyne well therin. Whiche ys suche. After that we haue had certayne victories against the Syracusains & made a walle nighe to their cytie, wythin the whyche walle we nowe be, Gylipvus the Lacedemonyan arryued wyth an hoste, aswell of the Peloponesyans, as of certen other cyties of thys countrey of Sycille, whom at the furst encontring we vaynquished: but afterwardes through force of the horsmen and casters of dartes, whyche he hath, we haue bene constrayned to retyre into oure sayd wall where we nowe remayne wythout doynge any thinge, for that, that we coulde not contynue our sayde walle aboute the sayde cytie, the ennemyes beinge in so great nōber: for we might not leade all our people vnto the felde, forsomuche, as it was necessarye to leaue alwayes one parte of them for to warde oure walles and tampares. And on the othere syde the ennemyes haue all readye reysedde vpp, an simple walle nighe vnto oure walle, whyche letteth vs for to fynishe yt, excepte that we shulde furste wythe a greate puissance, beate and rase downe the sayde walle by force of armes. In suche sorte, that we, whiche holde thys Cytie assieged, be more assieged on the lande syde, than they. For by meane of the great nomber of horsmen that they haue, we cannot yssue farre out of our campe. Moreouer they haue sente Ambassadoures into Peloponese, for to haue newe succours of people. And Gylippus is goone to the Cyties of Sycille, whiche be not yet on their partie, for to practyse and wynne theym. And by that, whyche I can lerne, they haue determyned for to assaulte oure rampares and fortes, all at one instante, aswell by sea as by lāde. Also ye ought not to iudge and thinke it strāge that I doo saye, that they wyll assaulte vs from the coaste of the sea. For though that our armye by sea was at the begyn

                  ynge greate and excellente, aswelle for that, that the shippes where very whole and clene, as also our men helthfull and gallant: yet neuerthelas at this presente our sayde shipps, by hauynge long ben in discouert and abroade, be in a manner vtterly putrefyed & rotten, and a greate parte of the maronners deade, and also it is not laufull for vs to bryng our said ships a borde or to shoare for to repayre and newe tacle them, for that, that our ennemyes haue as great nomber therof, as we, and more: so, that they threatene dailly for to assaille vs, whyche thynge they woll do wythout any faulte, for yt is in their power to do it, whan they woll, and also they may brynge their shipps to shore, muche more easely than we, for that, that they kepe not themselfe togyders: whych thynge was neuer hytherto in our facultie and power to do: to wit, to go to assaill them at our wylle. For albeit that we had great nomber of ships, yet neuerthelas we coulde skarcely warde ourself, before that our sayd shyppes were all togyther, as they nowe be. Forsomuche as if we had lefte anye smalle parte of our warde, we shulde not haue had victuailles, the whyche also we can not at thys present skarcely cary wythout dangier, for that, that we muste passe alonge by the cytie. Throughe the whyche diffyculties, if we haue hertofore loste of our maronners, we yet do nowe lose more of them, whan they goo to fatche water, woode and other necessaries, or for to ouer

And the selfe same, that become of their owne good wylle in hope of more than to fyght, seying the armye by sea of thennemys, and also their puissance by lande, farre otherwise than they thought: some of them go to the ennemyes upon some coulour, & the other thider, where they may eskape, whyche thynge is ryghte easy for them to do, for that, that the Islande is very greate: some other haue boughte of the esclaues of Hicatrie, whō they fynde meanes by practyse that they haue with the capytains of the shipps, to cause to sarue in their place: and by that manner they corrupte the disciplyne & order of the sea. And for that, that I do speake to men that vnderstande what belongeth to the sea, I saye for conclusyō that the flower and gallantues of this great nomber of people by sea, cannot longe endure. And also there be fewe good Pylottes and patrons to be founde, whyche can conducte and welle gouerne a shippe. And amongest all thies difficulties there is an other that also causeth me greatly to sorrowe. And that is, that albeit that I am chief of the armye by sea, yet can I not geue order therin: for your braynes and witts, lordes Athenians be yll to be corrected, and also we cannot gett other for to replenishe oure ships. whyche thynge our enemys do easely. For they haue many cyties that take their partie. And as touchynge vs, there ys none that takethe ours, resarued Nare and Carana, whyche be not verye puissaunte. Wherefore we be constraynedde to ayde oureselues wyth that smalle nomber that remaynethe wyth vs, of those, whyche we chargedde at the begynnynge. And if it chaunce that the Cyties of Italie (who delyuer vs victuailles, knowynge the estate, wherin we be, and that ye sende vs no succours) retourne frome vs, to oure ennemyes, wythoute fayle, we shalle be destroyedde wythoute faightynge. I coulde wryte (Lordes) things more pleasante vnto youe: but not more profytable, yf that ye be wyllynge to determyne well herein, understandynge oure affayre. Whereof I greately doubte, for I knowe well youre nature, whyche ys suche, that ye heare wyllyngly playsante thynges: and whan it happenethe otherewyse than youe thoughte, ye impute the blame to those, that haue the charge of the affayres. And yet neuerthelesse I thynke it beste to wryte the trouthe, that ye maye prouyde therefore. And also I am wyllynge to declare vnto you, that for the thynges, wherof you haue geuen vs charge in thys interpryse, ye cannot in any thynge charge the chyefeste and Capytayns, nor also the souldyars. Wherefore seyng that all Sycille conspyrethe nowe agaynste vs, and that they looke for newe succours oute from Peloponese, ayther determyne for to calle vs agayne home, consyderedde, that we be moore weake than oure ennemyes, euen in the estate, wherein they onelye nowe be: orells for to sende vs succours afreshe, that be not lesse of shyppes, nothere of men than this same here: and also of monney in good quantytye, and moreouer an othere generalle or chiefe in my steede: for that, that I cannot susteigne the charge, by cause of a disease of the reyns, whyche troublethe me greattely. And also me thynkethe that reasonne wylleth yt, for so longe as I haue bene in good healthe, I haue donne youe manye goode saruyces. And for conclusyon whatsoeuere thynge ye be wyllynge to doo, doo yt bytwene thys and the sprynge tyme wythoute longer delaye: for thys, that the ennemyes wythin shoorte tyme wolle wythdrawe to theyre partye alle the Sycilyans.

Suche was the tenour of the letters of Nycias: whyche sene, so farre as did touche the sending vnto hym of a successour in hys charge, they were not of that opynyō, but accordyng to that, that they shuld sende him collegues and cōpaignyōs, they dyd chose two of those, that were wyth him in the armye to be ayding vnto him in the meane tyme, to wytt, Menander and Eurymedon,

As to the reste, it was determyned for to sende newe succours, aswell of shypps, as of men, and aswell of maronners, as of men of warre, and aswell of theirs, as also of those of theire allyes. And moreouer they did appoyncte also two newe generalls or chief Capytains wyth the sayde Nycias: to wytte, Demosthenes,Demosthenes sonne of Alcisthenes and Eurymedon,Eurim

As concernyng Demosthenes he taryed for to cause that succours to be dispatched, which was ordeyned and appoyncted, to the intente, that in the beginninge of the sprynge tyme, he mighte embarque hymselfe wyth the sayde succours, and specially to constrayne the allyes of the Athenyans to fournishe shippes, men and monney for their portion.

               AFter that the Athenyans had appoyncted their sayde prouysions for Sycille, they sente twenty galleis aboute Peloponese, for to defende and wythstande, that no ships shulde passe fromthence out of Corinthe into Sycille. For the Corinthyans after that the Ambassadours of the Syracusayns, whyche were comme for to require newe succours were arryued vnderstandynge the affayres of Sycille to be in better estate, dyd yet take more couraige, and semed vnto theym that the armye, whyche they had sente bifore, was come all in tyme. For that cause they prepared for to sende thider renforte or newe succours of men in the platt Barques, and the Lacedemonyans wyth the reste of the Peloponesians did the lyke. So the Corynthyans armed xxv. galleys for to accompaygnye their Barques, and to defende them agaynste the galleys of the Athenyans, whyche attended and lay in wayte for them in the passage at Naupacte. As touchyng the Lacedemonyans, as they prepared their succours, beynge vrgently moued aswell by the Syracusains, as by the Corynthyans: vnderstandinge moreouer that the Athenyans sente newe succours into Sycille, for to empesche that, and chiefly through the counsail of Alcibiades, they determyned for to enter into the lande of the sayd Athenyans, and at the beginnynge to mure and walle in Decelea. And the Lacedemonyans enterprysed that same wyth the better couraige, by cause that they thoughte that the Athenyans hauynge greate warre in twoo coastes: to wytt, in Sycille and in their oune contrey,

shulde be the moore easely subdewed and vaynquished. And also that they hadde iuste quarelle, forsomuche as the Athenyans hadde furste broken the appoinctement: whiche thynge was whole contrary to the other former appoynctement. For the rotture or breache beganne on the bihalf of the Lacedemonians, for that, that the Thebains, had inuaded Platea, without breaking the appoinctement. And though that it was ordonned by the same, that warre shulde not be moued agaynste hym, that submitted hymself to the iudgement of the other confederated Cyties and that the Athenyans offredde to stande therunto: yet alwayes the Lacedemonyans wolde not accepte the offre: by occasion wherof, they thought that, wt good cause, they hadde receiued many mischances in the warre, whyche than was made, and speciallye at Pylus. But after the laste appoinctement, the Athenyans had sente thirty ships out of their sea and wasted one partie of the terry
                     •
                  orie of the Epidaurians and of the Prasyens: and also of some other countreys, and kepte men at Pylus, who robbed and spoylled the confederates wythout any ceassynge. And whan the Lacedemonyans sente vnto Athens for to demande restytution of the goodes, that were takene, and in case of refusal that they shulde commytt the thynge to knowlaige accordynge to the artycles of appoynctemente: yet wolde they neuer doo yt. For thys cause yt semedde to the Lacedemonyans, that as the fault & offence of the breache, which was in the former warre, was cōmytted on their bihalfe, so was i
                     •
                   nowe in the partie of the Athenians: by meane wherof they went against them wt the better harte. And so they commaunded to the other Pelonesyans that they shulde make prouysyon of Irons for the walles at Decelea, in the meane tyme, that they prouydedde for other matter therunto necessarie: and moreouer constrayned theym to fournishe monney for to sende succours into Sycille for their portion, lyke as the self Lacedemonyās did. And in thies enterfeats ended the wynter, whych was the .xviii yeare of the warre, whych Thucydides had wryttonne. In begynnynge of spring tyme, the Lacedemonyans wyth their allyes entred soubdaynely into the lande of the Athenyās, vnder conducte of Agis sonne of Archidamus kyng of the same Lacedemonyans. And at the furste arryuall they wasted and pillaiged the platte countrey, that was at the entrynge, and afterwardes dyd geue themselfe to enclose Decelea wyth walle, and delyuered to euery of the Cyties confederated accordynge to hys quantytie, to make one quarter of the sayde walle. Nowe the same cytie is afarre of from Athens aboutes seuene skore stades, and well nighe asmuche out of the countrey of Beotie. And for that cause, beynge enclosed with walle and garnished wyth men, one might, oute of the same, pillage & ouerronne the plat coūtrey vnto the Cytie of Athens. In thys same tyme that the walles of Decelea was in buildinge, the Peloponesyans, that taryed in the countrey sent the succours into Sycille in their Barques. To wytt, the Lacedemonyans, sixe houndred of the moste gentle compaignyons of their esklaues, and of their laborers, vnder the conducte of Eurytus of Sparte.Euritus. The Beotians three houndred, vnder the conducte of zenon and of Nycon of Phebes and Egesander the Thespian.

                   Thies here were the furste that at there departure frome Tenara in Laconium laūched into the meane sea. Sone after, the Corynthians sente fyue houndred men, aswell of their people, as of the Arcadyans, whyche they had soulded or hnyred, of whome Alexarchus the Corynthian was Chief:Alexarthus. and wyth them, there were two houndred Scycionians vnder the conduct of Sargeus Sycionien.Sargeus. On the other syde the .xxv. galleys, whyche the Corynthians hadde sent the wynter precedynge agaynste the twenty of the Athenyans that abodde at Naupacte for to kepe the passage, were foranempste the sayde Naupacte, so longe as

                  yedde their souldyars passed by. At the self same beginnynge of the sprynge tyme, whan the walles were buildinge about Decelea: the Athenyans sente .xxx. galleys aboute Peloponese vnder the conducte of Charycles,Charicles. to whome they comomaunded, that he shulde go fromthence in their name vnto the Argiues to requyre them that they woolde sende and fournishe wyth men for to fylle the sayde galleys accordynge to their allyance: and on the other syde in ensuing their determynation touching the affayres of Sycille, that they shulde sende thider Demosthenes wyth .lx. shippes of theirs, and fyue of those of Chio. In the whyche there was twelue houndred warryours Athenyans, and of the Islanders, asmanye as they coulde assemble: and of theire othere allyes, all those that they myght recouer beinge men of warre: and commaunde the sayde Demosthenes that in passynge he shulde ioygne wyth Charicles, and bothe togiders shulde pillaige and ouerronne the coūtrey Marytimate of Laconie. The whyche Demosthenes, sailled fromthence straight to the poarte of Egyne, wherin he attended those of his souldyars, that were not yet come, and lykewyse the retourne of Charicles, who was gone vnto the Argyues.
            
            
               ¶ Howe the Syracusains and the Athenyans had a battaille wythin the porte of the Cytie, aswel by sea as by land, wherof both parties had victorie in dyuers respectes, and of many other combates and feats of warre, whyche were done in the same Siege. ☞The .iiii. Chapter.
               IN the self tyme, that the thynges abouesayde were done in Grece Gylippus came agayne to Sarragosse wyth greate nomber of people, that he hadde assembled, and wythdrawin oute of the Cyties of Sycille, wherin he hadde bene. So he assembledde the Syracusains and shewedde them that yt was expedyente that they shulde arme alle the shippes that they coulde, for to fyght agaynste the Athenyans by sea, sayinge that he hoped, in that doinge, to doo some thynge woorthye of memorye. And Hermocrates dydde lykewyse exhorte theym therunto: saying that they ought not to feare the Athenyans by sea, for thys, that they were not naturallye men of warre, as the othere. For the Cytie of Athenes was not vpon the sea, as Sarragosse, but rathere it was muche furthere in the mayne lande, and that that same, whiche they hadde learnedde by sea, was for feare of the Medes, who constrayned them to aduenture in the sea, and to hardy men, as the Athenyans be, those seme terrible, whyche shewe themself, as couraigious, as they. And euen as they somtyme feared their neighbours moore by theire greate audacytye than by theire power was requyred, so maye they fynde of the souldyars, their aduersaries, which shal do the lyke vnto them. And in makynge thies perswations vnto the Syracusains, he tolde them, that he knewe well their hardynes, by the desyre, whiche they shewed to haue to go agaynste the armye by sea of the Athenyans: of the whiche feate, that shulde be so vnloked for of them, they shalbe so astonyedde, that that same shall proffitt more the Syracusains, than the science and exercyse by sea, whyche those Athenyans haue vsedde so greatlye, shall aduantage theyme. By suche woordes and declarations Gylippus and Hermocrates and somme other that followedde theyme aboute the nyghte, dydde putte hys footemen in order wythout the towne, to the intent that at one tyme he might assaille the enemys

both by lande on the coste of the walle that is in Plemmyriū, and also the shipps on the sea coste. In the morninge .xxxv. galleys of the Syracusains yssued forth out of the lytle porte, where their hauen was, for to goo to the greate porte, whiche the ennemyes dyd kepe: and .xlv othere to saille enuironing and compassynge aboute the sayde greate porte
                     •
                   and also for to go to assaille Plemmyrium, to the ende that the Athenyans perceyuynge themselfe assailled on both sydes, shulde be more troubled: who seing that, fournished incontinently .lx. galleys that they had, wherof they soubdaynly sente .xxv. agaynste the, xxxv. of the Syracusains, whyche came towardes the greate poarte for to fyghte wyth theyme: and wyth the other they saylled agaynste those that compassed it aboutes, wyth the whych they medled incontynently in the poarte, and dyd fyght a longe tyme. The Syracusains enforsinge themself to enter into the poarte, and the other to kepe and to defende theyme frome yt. In thys meane tyme the Athenyans, that were in Plemmyrium, beinge descended downe of the rocke vnto the shore of the sea for to see what shulde fortune of the battaille, that was in hande: Gylippus vpon the breake of daye, came to assaille the sayde place of Plemmyryum, frome the syde of the lande wyth suche force, that he toke one of the thre walles, and soone after dyd take the other two, for that, that those, whyche had the warde and defence therof, seinge that the furste was so soone taken, dyd not defende them. And they, that were at the warde of the furste wall, after that it was taken, fledde frō
                  thence and wyth greate danger retyred into galleys, whych were always kepte at the fote of the rocke, and partly in a Barque, that was founde there, and in the same retyred into their campe: though that a galley of the Syracusains, to wit, of those, that were already entred into the porte followed them very nyghe: for the Syracusayns had already the victorie in the greate porte. But in the meane tyme that the othere twoo walles of Plemmyrium were takene, it chauncedde that the Syracusayns were vaynquishedde. Whereupon those amonge theyme that fledde awaye, through cause of the other vyctorie, had their retraicte moore easey. And the vyctorye was in thys sorte. For the Syracusayns galleys, whyche dydde fyghte in the mouth of the greate poarte (hauinge repoulsed those of the ennemyes, that were agaynste theyme) sailledde in at the entrance wythout anny order, so that the one empeschedde and dyd lette the othere. Which parceyued by the Athenyans, aswell those, that dyd combate without the poarte, as also those that were vainquished wythin, ioygnned themself togiders, and russhed aswell vpon those, that were within the porte, as also vpon those, that were with out, wyth suche force, that they caused them to flye. Whereof they dyd synke elleuen, and dyd slaye all those that were wythin, resarued thre, whyche they toke prysonners: and thre other shyppes they br
                     •
                  sed. After that same victorie, the Athenyans, hauynge wythdrawin the shipp wrackes of the ennemyes, they reysed the trophee in the lytle Islande, that is Plymmirium, and afterwardes retyred into their campe. On the other syde of the Syracusayns, by cause of the thre walles, whyche they had taken in the sayd Plymmyrium, they raysed vp three other trophees. Of the whiche three walles, they battred and rased downe that same, whyche they hadde laste taken, and the other twoo they rampared, and did put therin good garnyson, and warde. In takynge of the sayde walles, many of the Athenyans were slayne, and many taken prysoners: and moreouer all their monney, whyche was a greate some was also taken, for they kept thys place, as for a forte, to wythdrawe and warde all theire treasure, and all their munytions and marchandises, not onely of the Seygnyory, but also of Capytaynes, and of marchauntes and of particuler souldyars. And amonge othere thynges there were

found the sayles of forty galleys, and thre other galleys, that were wythdrawin thider. That same takyng or losse did afterwardes cause many greate dammaiges to the Athenyans, and chiefly for thys
                     •
                   that through the occasyon therof they could not brynge the victuaills into their campe wythout danger. For the ships, whyche were there, dydde fyghte and empesche them alwayes, whyche thynge dyd geue geue vnto the Athenyans great feare, and also great displeasure. Aftere thys battayll, the Syracusains sente .xii. gallleys, vnder the cōducte of Agatharcus Syracusain.Agatharchus. The one wherof dyd cary certayne Ambassadours whyche the sayde Syracusains sente into Peloponese, for to signefye vnto the Peloponesians both what had bene done, and also how they were in good hope to haue the vyctorie agaynste the Athenyans, and also for to prouoke them that they shuld sende succours vnto theym, and shulde ernestly follow or take that same warre vnto herte. The other elleuen were sent into Italie, for that, that it was bruyted, that certayne shyppes chargedde wyth stuffe and wyth munytions were sente to the campe of the Athenyans at Sarragosse: the whyche shippes, those Syracusains did encounter, and toke the moste parte therof, togiders wyth that, whiche was wythin them. Wherof the stuffe that was therein charged, for to make ships, they brunt it vpon the shore of the sea, nigh vnto Caulonia. And that d
                     •
                  ne, they saylled vnto the poarte of Locres: beynge in whyche place, aryued one barque, that came oute of Peloponese, charged wyth men of warre, Thespyens, whiche were sente to the succours of the sayde Syracusayns: the whiche they dyd take into their galleis, and afterwardes dyd take their rayce or votage for to retourne into their countrey: and so they encountred at Megara twenty Athenyās galleis, that espyed them there in the passage: the whyche dyd take one of the said elleuen, and the other that eskaped, did come to Sarragosse. After that, an other light combate, was made betwene the Athenyans and the Syracusains in the poarte of Sarragosse: to wycte, a rampare of woode, whyche the sayd Syracusains had made before the olde hauon for to kepe their shippes wythin in suertie. Byfore the whyche, the Athenyans brought a greate nauie wyth tenne thousande, chargedde, welle armed and appoyncted for to susteigne alle stroakes of shotte and of Artillerie. And behynde the same were smalle Barques, wythin the whyche, and also wythin the sayde nauye, were men that hadde Engynes, wherewyth they rased downe the pales and plankes of woode of the sayde rampare, that were fyxed and planted wythin the sea. Where agaynst the Syracusains resisted wyth greate stroakes of shotte, whyche they dyschargedde and dyd cast out of the sayd hauone. Also those of the sayde nauye, dydde the lyke against theyme. Fynallye the Athenyans brake downe a greate parte of the sayde rampare, although that they hadde greate payne and difficultie therin, for that, that there was greate pieces of woode that were hoolye hyddene wythin the watere, whyche were so plantedde of a sette purpose, to the intente that if the shyppes of the ennemyes woolde comme there, they shulde stryke and bruse theyme, and shulde be by that meane in danger. And though the Athenyans hadde plongeors or dyuers that dyuedde for to cutt them vnder the water: yet neuerthelas aftere that they were wythdrawyn, the Syracusayns caused other to be replantedde. And the one dyd daylly make againste the othere some newe enterpryse and inuention, so as it is to be byleued of two armys that kepe cāpe the one nigh to the othere, and moreouer they made many eskarmuches and small combates in all soortes, and by all meanes that were possyble to doo. Nowe the Syracusains hadde sente Ambassadoures to the Lacedemonyans, to the Corynthyans and to the Ambracyans, sygnefyinge vnto theyme the takynge of Plemmyryum,

and also the battaille that they had vpon the sea. Certefyinge that the victorye, that the Athenyans had had agaynste them was not chanced, throughe the valyantnes of those same Athenyans, but for the mysorder of themself. Wherfore they hadde good hope to remayne in the ende victorious: but so, that they might be aydedde and succoured. And therupon required that they wolde succour thē wyth shippes and wyth men, before that the armye, whyche they Athenyans shulde sende thyder for newe succours, myght arryue there. For in that doynge men myghte destroye those, that were in the campe byfore the comynge of those same thider: and thereby ende the warre. Thys was the estate of the affayres of Sycille.
            
            
               ¶ Of the necessitie wherein the Cytie of Athenes was through the warre. And howe certen Thracyans that were comme to their saruyce, beinge for faulte of monney retourned and sente home, did destroy the Cytie of Mycalesus, and afterwards were well nygh all destroyed. ☞The .v. Chapter.
               IN thys tyme whilest the affayres abouesayd, were donne in Sycille, Demosthenes hauyng assembled the souldyars, whyche were ordonned for to go to the succours of the cāpe, that was before Sarragosse: caused them to be embarqued at Egyne, and fromthence came sailing alonge from of Peloponese and ioygnedde hymselfe wyth Charicles, who attended or wayted wt .xxx. ships for him, wherin the men were chargedde, whiche the Argiues had sente for their portion. And frōthence they saylled straight towards the lande of Laconie: that is to say, of the Lacedemonyans. But furste they landed in the coūtrey of Lymera in the terrytorie of Epidaure,Limera wherof they wasted a greate parte. Fromthence they came to lande in the saide contrey of Laconie of the coaste of Cytherea, foranempste the temple of Apollo: where they dyd some damaige, and enclosed wt a wall a distraicte, like vnto the same of Corinthe, whiche is called Isthmus,Isthmus. to the ende that the esklaues of the Athenyās might withdrawe thider and saue themself, whan they woolde flye frome their lordes: and also for to kepe there theues and pyrates, that shuld pillaige the countrey roūde aboute, lyke as they dyd at Pylus. But before that the walle was made Demosthenes saylled strayght to Corcyre, for to leuie there the men that shulde come out of that quarter: and to passe fromethence straighte into Sycille, and he lefte Charicles there, for to parfaict and fynishe the sayde wall, with his thyrtie ships Who, incontynentlye after that it was acheued, and that a good garnysone was put into it, departed fromthence for to followe Demosthenes. The Argiues also dyd the lyke. In that same sommer arryued at Athens .xiii. houndred Thracians, whyche were surnamed Macherophoriens, that were of the discent of Dyacus, all well armed, and wearinge targettes, the whyche were caused to comme wyth Demosthenes into Sycille: whome for that, that they were come to late, after the departure of Demosthenes, the Athenyans determyned to retourne & sende agayne into their countrey. For they thought it to great charge for to kepe them there for the warre, whych they had at Decelea, for that, that euery of thē wolde haue a groate for y• day. And the monney beganne greatly to consume in Athens, for this chiefly, that after the Peloponesyans had altogider mured and fortefyed the towne of Decelea, in ye same somer they dyd putt into it afterwards

garnysons oute of all cyties, whyche were changed by quartiers, wherby many greate euills and losses aswell of monney, as of othere goodes, happened to the Athenyans: by meane of this, that where at other tymes, whan the Peloponesians came to ouerronne their lande, they taryed not therin longe, and aftere that they were retourned, the Athenyans were not empesched to laboure their lande nor to enioye yt at their wylle. After that the sayde towne was enclosed and the garnysone putte wythin yt, they were contynuelly vexed, and as in manner assieged by the sayde garnysone, whyche ceassed not to ouerronne & pyllaige some tyme in small nomber and sometyme in great, and very often tymes for to haue vyctuailles, and other thinges necessarie. But aboue all, so longe as Agis kinge of Lacedemonie was there wyth all the army, they were maruaillously endommaged, for he neuer suffredde hys people to be ydle, but contynuellye caused theym to course and go into the lande, in suche sorte that they made meruaillous waste and pillayge in alle the lande of Athenes. And besydes that the skla
                     •
                  es whyche they had, fledde from them to the sayd Peloponesians to the nomber of twenty thousande and vp wardes, whyche were all or the moore parte people of occu
                     •
                  acyons and handy crafte men. They loste morouer almoste all their beastes aswel great as lytle. And also their horses were in a small tyme so trauailled that they coulde not sarue longe. For their horsemen were contynually in the feldes, aswel for to resiste the ennemyes that were at Decelea, as also for to warde all the regyon of Athens, from pillage, wherby some of the sayd horses were morefounded & the other lamed and tyred wyth ronninge so oftene into that same lāde, whych was drye and harde: and also many of them were hurt, aswell wt stroakes of dartes, as also with other stroaks. And in the remenāt, the victuails yt were brought into the cytie oute of the quarter of Eubea & of Oroppe, whiche were wonte to passe by Decelea, that was the next way, were forced to come by an other coaste more further of, so that they compassed about the lande of Sunium by sea, whiche was a thynge of great charge and expence, by occasyon wherof, the cytie was in greate necessytie of all thynges, that were requisitt to be brought thyder fr
                     •
                  m wythout. And on the other parte, the Cytezeins, who were all retyred into the cytie, were greatly trauailled by meane of watche, that was conuenyent for them to make wythout cessynge, aswell by day, as by nighte. For by daye there was a certen nomber incessantly vpon the heighte of the walles, who were contynually changed, and in the nyght all the watche was in harnes, resarued the horsmen, the one vpon the walles, and the other in and through the towne, aswell in tyme of sommer, as also of wynter, whyche was vnto them a payne intollerable. And so muche the moore, that at one selfe tyme, they susteigned twoo greate warrs. And yet neuertheles they were so obstynate, that no man, y• had not sene it, could haue beleued it. For albeit that they were assieged euen vnto the wals by the Peloponesyans, yet for all that they woolde not forsake nor leaue of the enterprise of Sycille, but euene so, as they were assyegedde, they woolde stylle holde the Cytie of Sarragosse assiegedde, the whyche was for a Cytie nothynge lesse, thā Athenes: wyllynge by that meane to declare theire puyssance and theire audacytie, muche moore greate than the othere Grekes hadde opynyon therof from begynnynge of the warre. Of whome some iudged that those Athenyans shuld susteigne the warre for twoo yeares, the other for three yeares at the furtheste and that than it shulde haue cessed. But no man thought that it shulde haue endured longer, if it chancedde that the Peloponesyans woolde haue entred into their lande. And yet neuerthelas frome the furste tyme that they were entredde therin, vntill that they sente into Sycille, were seuentene whole yeares. And that

notwythstandinge they were not so decayed by the sayde warre of .xvii. yeares, but that they enterprysed yet the other, whyche was not lesse in the opynyon of men than the furste. And the sayde cytie of Athens being troubled aswell for the towne of Decelea
                     •
                   as by the other meanes here aboue declared, yt was come into greate indigence and lacke of monney: through occasyon whereof, they exacted and leuyedde that same yeare of theire subiectes in places nyghe the sea, in stede of trybute, whyche they toke by Anticipation, the twentith parte of their valeur: thinkynge that the same shulde render vnto them more monney, than the ordenary trybute. So was it nedefull
                     •
                   for the expēces were somuche the greater, as the warre was more greate: and also their rente failled them or was decayedde. For thys cause, incontynently as the Thracyens that were comme to their succours, were arryued, as hath bene sayde, they retourned or sente them awaye for lacke of monney, and gaue the charge to Dytrepus for to conducte them by sea:Dytrepus. to whome they comaunded that in retournynge them, he shulde fynde the manner that they shulde do some damaige in Eubea, and in othere places by the sea side of thennemys, alongest by whome they shulde passe: for it was conuenyente for them, to passe the distraict of Eubea, which is called, Euripus.Euripus. The whiche Dytrepus beinge landed wyth the sayd Thracyens at Tanagra, he pillaiged somewhat ryght soubdainely, & after caused them incontynently to mounte again & caryed them into Chalcyde in the countrey of Eubea, and towardes night passed the distraict and sailled for to lande in the countrey of Beoce. In the whyche beinge landed, he caused all hys men, all the nyght to marche towardes the Cytie of Mycale:Micalessus. and caused therin to hyde themselfe wythin the temple of Mercuryus
                     •
                   whyche is distant out of the sayd cytie abouts .xvi. stades. And after that it was day, he caused them to marche strayght towardes the sayde cytie. The whiche
                     •
                   though that it was greate, yet neuerthelas he fourthwyth did take for that yt was not warded. And also the Cytezeins had no doubte of annythynge. For they neuer thought, that passengers by sea wolde haue come so farre into the lāde, For this cause they had yll walles aboute their towne & also they were fallene in some parts & in other very lowe. And morouer for that, that they feared none enterprise, they locked not in their gates. The Thracians than being entred into the towne did pillage it vtterly, aswell ye tēples & holly places, as the pryuate houses & prophane places, & this, which yet was worst, they dyd slay al that they foūde lyuinge, aswell the people of all sec
                     •
                  es & ages, as also the beastes. For it is the nature and facyon of the Thracyans, whyche be people amonge all other, moste Barbarous, to do all sorte of crueltie, in whatsoeuer place that they be, wythout feare. And amonge the othere they committed and perpetrated one righte great myschiefe.

               ¶Of that whiche Demosthenes and Eurimedon Dukes of the Athenyans did in their voiage, sayllynge to the succours of the campe, that was at Sarragosse. And of the succours that arryued for those of the towne. And also of a battaylle by sea, whiche the Athenyans had agaynste the Peloponesyans nigh vnto Naupactum. ☞The .vi. Chapter.
               ANd for to retourne to that, whiche was done in Grece, after that Demosthenes had enclosed with wall that place, wherof we haue spokē, in the countrey of Laconie, he departed fromethence for to passe into Corcyre, and in saillinge he founde in the poarte of Phia,Phia. whiche is in the countrey of Elyens, one barque charged wyth men of warre, beynge Corynthians, whiche woulde haue gone into Sycille, whiche he sonke, but the people saued themself and afterwardes recouered an other, wherein they passedde into Sycille.

Afterwardes he came fromethence to Naupacte, whider he caused the Messenyans, to come, and fromethence he trauersed and passed into the lande of Acarnanie, which is on the other syde in the mayne lande, and there came vnto the townes of Alizea and of Anactoryum,

But afterwardes whan they thought good, they marched agaynst the Athenyans. The one armye dyd faight long agaynst the other, in suche sort that thre Corinthians galleis were sonken & as touching the Athenyans although that there were none of them drowned

And in effect the battaile was of suche sorte, that euery of the parties pretended to haue had the victorye. Neuerthelas the Athenyans receyued their shyppe wrackes, but beyng charged wyth a great wynde, they retyred the one of the one syde and the other an other waye, to wytt, the Peloponesians into their hauone, where they were in suertie by meane of their people that were in the lande, and the Athenyans vnto Naupacte. After whiche departure the Corynthians dydde incontinently reyse vp a Trophee by cause of the shyppes which they had destroied and crusshed in greater nomber than those, which they had loste, reputinge theymselfe not to be vainquishedde, for the selfe reasone, for whyche the ennemyes reputed theymeselfe also not to haue vaynequished. For that that it semedde to the Corynthyans not to haue bene vainequished, excepte the victory of thennemyes had bene greate. Also the Athenyans to the contrarye helde themself as for ouercome, if they had not great victory. Notwythstanding after that the Peloponesians were gone oute of the sayed hauone and their footemen departed fromethence, the Athenyans reysed vp a trophee in Achaia, as victoryous, although that they were more than twenty stades a farre of the place, frome Erimeum, where the Corynthyans shipps were.

               AFter that the Thuriens were allyed or confederated wyth the Athenyans, as hath bene abouesayd. Demosthenes and Eurymedon caused them to fournyshe seuene houndred men well armedde and three houndred darte casters, the which they embarqued and commanded them, that they shulde go fromthence straight into the quarter of Crotonia. And they, after that they had takene mouster of their men nigh the ryuer of Sibaris,Syberis. ledde them through the lande of the Thuriens agaynst Crotonia. But being arryued in the ryuer of Hylias,Hylias. they founde certene messengers of the Crotoniens, whyche declared vnto theyme, that their Lordes were not wyllynge that they shulde passe throughe their lande. By occasion whereof they toke their waye towardes the sea, alongest the sayd ryuer, and being arryued in the quarter, where it entreth into the sea, they lodged there their hoste, where their shippes aryued, Wher

In this meane tyme the Syracusains, beynge aduertised of their comynge, enterprysed afreshe for to proue and essay the fortune of battaile by sea, and also appoyncted a good nomber of footemen by lande. Nowe they hadde dressed a good nomber of ships of an other sorte, than they had done in the furst battaile, for that, that in the same, they had learned & parceyued the faulte of those, which they than had, wherupon hauing prouyded for the same faulte, they hoped well to haue the victorye, for they had shortened the beckes and poynctes of the foore partes of their shyps for to make them more

                  irme and more stiffe, and also they had armed the wastes or sydes of their sayed shyps with greate peces of woode of .vi. Cubittes of length asmuche within, as withoute, of the selfesorte, that the Corynthians had done with their ships, whan they did fight against the Athenians at Naupacte. And it semed well vnto them, that by that meane comynge against the Athenians shippes, whiche shulde not be made of that same sorte, but shulde haue their foore partes longer and more subtile, for that, that they come not ryght for to schocke with the poynct but wēt more sydelyng for to strike on the sydes, their ships shulde be as good and better than the othere. And that hauing to fight within the poarte wyth great nomber of ships, there shulde not be space for to saille by tourneying or in course, but must of necessitie come afronte, wherby the poynctes of their shyps beyng strongest & better armed with Irone than the other they shuld easely crushe and bruse them. And by that meane they hoped that the same, which at the other battaille had caused thē to lose through ignorance of their maroners: shulde nowe cause them to haue the victorye. And also those same Athenyās shulde not haue facultie and power for to withdrawe their shippes at their will, for afterwardes to come againe to schocke on those of the ennemyes as they hadde done the other tyme, excepte that they shulde withdrawe theyme frome the lande syde, and yett frome the same coaste they coulde haue no greate espace for to doo yt, and also they shoulde fynde the
Syracusayns on the shoore, whyche shoulde be readye for to endomage theym and for to succour the same Syracusains, and moreouer being in a straict place, they shuld empesche and let the one the other, whiche thynge had alwayes causedde greate anoyance and hurte vnto the Athenyans in all their battaylles by sea, for that, that they coulde not wythdrawe theymself so easely, as the Syracusayns, who hadde the smalle poarte wholy in their power, and also kepte the mouthe of the greate poarte empeschedde, and by that meane, they hadde the mayne sea, where the Athenyans hadde for all their feate, but onely the greate poarte, whiche was not spacious ynoughe, and also they hadde Plemyryum agaynste theyme, whiche was in the mouthe of the sayed greate poorte.

Whan the Athenyans perceyued the sayd shyps of the ennemyes for to come fourth, they all were thereby greatlye trowbledde. For hauyng sene the footemen a lytle bifore marchyng towardes the wall, they thought not

armed, some within their shyps and the other on the shoares of the greate porte, and alongest the bankes for to succour their shippes. And after that the shippes were charged, whiche were founde to be .lxxv. they marched agaynst the othere, whiche were foore skoare. And so they dyd fyght togiders all that same daye, geuing greate aflaultes, the shippes of the one partie, agaynste the other, wythoute that they myght do any thing of great importance nother of the one syde nor of the other, but that the Syracusayns did sinke one or two shippes of thennemys and fynally towardes night departed, and euery one retyredde into his quarter. And they of the towne, that were come oute of the towne agaynste the walles of the Athenyans dyd the lyke. The morowe after the Syracusains did nothynge, and also shewed that they would do nothing. For this cause Nycias, hauing sene that the daye precedinge they were egall, doubtinge least that they would haue ones againe essayed fortune, he comanded the patrons & capitains of his shippes that they shulde repaire their shipps, those whiche had bene by any meanes crusshed or brused. Afterwardes he caused his platt barques to be wtdrawin, which he had made to be enclosed in a corner of the great porte with pales for to be in suertie, and caused them to be caste and lanched into the sea distante & separated the one from the other, the space of a dayes labour of grounde, to the ende that if by faightynge any of his galleys were oppressed, he myght recouer the sayd barques. In suche preparations & other like, the Athenyans cōsumed that same day and the night following. The morowe following the Syracusains came fourth aswelle by sea as by lande in the same sorte as they yssued fourth the daye bifore, resarued that they came in a better houre, and also did fight the greatest parte of the day in the manner that they had done in the former battaille, without that it were perceyuedde that the one partie had in any thinge aduantage of the othere. Than Ariston Corynthian, whiche was the beste maronner and patrone that was in the armye of the Syracusayns causedde yt to be knowin vnto the other capytaynes of the shyppes, that they shulde sende with all diligence of their men into the cytie and he woulde do the lyke for to geue order that men shulde constrayne those whyche had victuailles ready to brynge them to be solde to the sea syde, to the intente that they myghte cause all their people soubdaynely to be repasted, and fourthwyth to mounte agayne into their shyppes and to assayle the ennemyes vnlooked for or vnprouyded, whiche thinge was done, and in a right shorte space, greate habundance of victuailles hauynge bene brought to the sea banke, they retyredde faire and easely for to dyne. The Athenyans perceyuynge whyche thynge, and thynkynge that they had retyred as vainequished, they retyred lykewyse, and landed some for to make the dynner ready, and the other to do other busynes, not thynkynge that for that same daye, there shulde haue bene any battaille by sea. But sone after they dyd see the Syracusayns, which had dynedde, to come soubdainely agaynste theyme in greate haste, whereof they were greatly abasshed, and yet neuerthelas embarqued theymeselfe agayne tumultuously and oute of order, as faste as they coulde, the moste parte, bifore that they had eatene any thyng and came to mete the sayd ennemyes. And whan they were in sight and verye nyghe the one vnto the other, they planted theymself aswelle on the one syde as of the other for to deuyse aither of theyme, howe they myghte assault hys ennemyes to hys aduantage, neuerthelas the Athenyans reputynge yt for greate shame, that the ennemyes should surmount, excell and passe them in endurynge laboure and trauaille, they dydde furste geue the signe of battaille and came to geue charge vpon their sayd ennemyes, who receyued theyme wyth the poyncte of the foore partes of their shyppes welle armedde, and well strengthened,

lyke as they had determyned, in suche sortte, that they crusshed a greate parte of theyme and dyd breake the poyncte of their oares, and afterwardes oute of the toppe castelles of the sayd shyppes, wyth greate stroackes of stoanes and of dartes dyd greatly hurte those, that were wythin. But the small lyght shypps of the Syracusayns dyd them yet more hurte, which came to assaille and hurte them wyth castynges of dartes and wt hande stroakes on all sydes in suche manner that the Athenyans were constrayned to putt themself into flyght and wyth the ayde of their barques retyred into their campe, for the Syracusayns durste not followe theym

But seuene of the Athenyans shyps were sonken and many crusshed, and moreouer a greate nomber of their people deade and takene. By reason of the whiche victory, the Syracusayns reysed vp their Trophee, perswadyng themself fromethensforwardes to be stronger, than the Athenyans by sea, and that they shulde be in shorte tyme as stronge wyth footemen as they, through occasyon wherof they prepared themself for to assaille theym at an other tyme.

               IN thies enterfeates, Demosthenes and Eurymedon arryued in the campe of the Athenyans wyth .lxxiii. shyppes aswell of their oune as of their allyes, which caryed aboute fyue thousande warryours fotemen partely of their people and partely of their sayed allyes and subiectes togiders with a great nomber of other barbarous and strangers and slyngers, archers and darte casters, aswell of Grece as of other countreis, wherof the Syracusayns were greatly astonyed, and parceyued no meane to be hable to eskape and resist one so greate a puissance, sithens that the Athenyans beinge assieged in their countrey by meane of Decelea, hadde neuerthelas sente thider one so greate succours, as puissant as the furst, wherby they iudged their puissance not to be withstande, and considerynge also that their furst armye, whiche had bene repoulsed and beatene in the former battaille, dyd recouer couraige by the commynge thereof. Demosthenes, after that he was arryued, dyd immediatly geue order for to execute his enterpryse and to employ his force as sone as he coulde, for auoyding the erroure whiche Nycias had bifore comytted, who, beyng come into suche reputation that all Sycille was thereby afrayde, yet neuerthelas for that, that at the arryuall he came not bifore Sarragosse, but consumedde many dayes at Catana, he bothe loste hys reputacion, and also Gylippus, by meane of his retardance & slackenes had had time for to bring to Sarragosse, the succours of Peloponese bifore his aryual. Which succours, those same Syracusains shuld not haue had nother yet demanded, if Nicias had assieged thē at the aryual, repucing thē not to be puissāte ynough for to defende their towne against the force of the said Nycias, though neuerthelas they afterwardes did knowe the contrary, but that shulde haue bene to late whan they shulde haue bene enclosedde on all

sydes, in suche sorte that the succours coulde no more haue comme vnto theym in tyme. Demosthenes consideryng whyche thynges, and also that thennemyes shoulde be greatly afrayedde of hys commynge, he woulde, that selfe daye that he arryuedde, doo some feate. And seynge that the walle, whyche the Syracusayns hadde made ouerthwarte, that same of the Athenyans for to empesche and lett that men shoulde not fynyshe yt, was all syngle and that one myghte easely beate it downe: after that he had gottene Epipole, and the rampares that were there made, wherin were noe people, that might resist his strength: he hasted for to assaulte it, trustynge in a small tyme to see an ende of the warre, for he purposed aither to take Sarragosse by force, orelles to leade and carye agayne all that same armye into hys countrey wythoute any more trauaillynge all the Athenyans, aswelle those that were there, as the other that remayned. In this enterprise the Athenyans entred into the lande of the Syracusayns, and furst did go for to ouercome the quarter of Anapus, which they pillaged, and wasted, and also kept yt at their wyll as they had done bifore tyme, for that, that no men warre yssued fourhe agaynste theyme, nother by sea, nor by lande, excepte the horsemen and darte casters, whiche were in Olympus. Afterwardes it semed good to Demosthenes for to assaille the rampares of the ennemyes wyth engynes of artillerye, but the Syracusayns fourthwyth after that the sayd engynes were nyghe vnto the rampares, dyd sett fyer therein: and those, that were deputedde for to assa
                     ••
                  le them in dyuers places, were repoulsed, by occasion whereof he caused his people to retyre, and it semed not expediente vnto hym to lose any more time there, but rather to assault Epipole, which thyng he perswaded Nycyas and hys other collegues to do, but. he coulde not do it in suche time, but that the ennemyes shulde parceyueyt. For this cause they comanded that euery souldyar, shulde make prouysion of victuailles, for fyue dayes for hymselfe, and moreouer they caused all the masons, and carpenters that were in the hoste to assēble togider, and a greate nomber of people, for to gather and carye stoanes togiders with all thinges that were necessarye for to buylde and reyse vp walles and rampares, and a greate quantitie of darres, shaftes and of all thynges to caste wyth the hande, to the intente to beate downe incontinently a fortresse in the sayd place of Epipole, if they coulde take it. That done in begynnynge of the nyght, he, Eurymedon and Menander marched with the greatest partie of the armye agaynst the sayd place of Epipole, and lefte Nycyas for to warde the walles, and so they came verye nigh frome the rocke vnto the place that is calledde Euricleus, bifore that the watche of the Syracusayns, whiche was at the furste walle, parceyued theyme, and toke the furste walle of the ennemyes, and dydde slaye one parte of theyme that wardedde yt. The othere, and the more parte sauedde theymeself, and certefyed the comyng of the ennemyes vnto three wardes that were there, to wytt, that same of the Syracusayns, that same of the other Sycillians, and that same of their othere allyes, but pryncipally and furste, the sixe houndredde Syracusains, that warded that same quarter, who, though that they defended themself valyantly, were yet neuerthelas repoulsedde by Demosthenes, and by the Athenyans, and all with one power chasing them they followed theym to the other wardes, that they shulde not haue space to locke themself togider againe nother to the othere for to defende themself, with suche diligence, that they toke all the said rampares and bullwerkes and immediatly began to rase them downe frome the heighe of them. Than the Syracusayns and Gylippus, seynge the audacytie of the Athenyans, to be so comme for to assaulte their rampares in the night, they yssuedde fourth of their quarters whiche they warded, & came to geue charge vpon them

but at the beginning they were repoulsed. Neuerthelas afterwardes the Athenians marching further without order, as people whiche had the victory, and also for that, that they feared, that onles they vsed diligēce to execute their enterprise and to beate downe the rampares, the ennemys shulde haue leasure to assemble themself againe, they hasted the most that they might for to breake and grinde down the sayd rampares. But afore that they had fully repoulsed the ennemys, they were repoulsed furst by the Thebayns, who furst susteyned their force and afterwardes by the othere, so that they were putt to flyght, wherein there was greate disorder and losse and manye dangers and difficultes whyche myght not welle be sene for that, that yt was nyght. For euene of thynges, whiche be done in the day tyme, men cannot knowe for trouth the certaintie of the whole by those that were thereat, for that, that skarcely any one man can declare what was done where he was and moste nyghe vnto hym, wherefore it ys impossible to knowe distinctly what hathe bene done in a conflicte by night bitwene twoo greate hoastes. And althoughe that the moone dydde shyne that same nyght, yet the clerenes was not so greate that one myght welle knowe twoo men, thoughe that he dyd see the parsones, nother iudge whiche was frende or ennemye. And somuche the lesse that they were manye and in greate nomber locked togiders in a smalle place, aswelle of the one syde as of the other. But in effecte the Athenyans beinge in one quarter repoulsedde by the othere, that followedde their furste victory, the one mountedde vpon the rampares of the Syracusayns, the othere came to the succours of their people, and knewe not whider that they shoulde goo, for that, that beyng the furst in flyght, and the cry greate, a man coulde not vnderstande nor see by annye tokene by cause of the nyght, and moreouere in repoulsynge the ennemyes, whome they encountredde made lykewyse greate cryes. On the other syde the Athenyans dydde searche and woulde haue chosene oute their people, and for that, that they were in flyght all those, whiche they encountredde they suspectedde to be their ennemyes, and hauyng none other meane to knowe the one the othere, but by the crye of the nyght in demaundynge the one after the othere, they made greate bruytt whereby greate trouble dydde lykewyse ensue, and also they declaired by that meane vnto the ennemyes their sayd crye, who, insomuche as they hadde the victorye and were not afrayed, as the Athenyans were, dydde knowe theymeselfe the better, by meane whereof, if annye of the sayed ennemy

                  s dydde fynde theymeself in smalle nomber amonge any greate floate of the Athenyans, they toke vppe their crye, and by that meane eskapedde, where the Athenyans, whyche knewe not the same of the enenemyes there as they were founde weakest, were slayne. And furdermore there was one thynge, whyche troubled them more than all the rest, to wytt, the sounde of instrumentes and the songes whyche men dydde synge for the victorye. For the ennemyes and those that were wyth the Athenyans, as the Argyues, the Corciriens and al the other Doryans dydde sounde and synge all of one facyon, whereby at all and asmanye tymes as that was done, those same Athenyans knewe not on whyche syde ytt was done nothere to what purpose. By all the whyche thynges trouble was so great amongeste theyme, that after they encountredde togider, they dydde fyght, bifore that they coulde knowe the one the othere, and those, whyche fledde, knewe not what waye to kepe. Whereby yt chancedde that there were manye of them, that tombledde downe of the rocke into hollowe places, and where the waye failled theyme, beynge pursuedde and oppressed by the ennemyes dydde slaye theymself, for that that the place of Epipole was very hygh, and there were fewe comynges and wayes thereunto, the whyche were also verye straight, so that yt was verye

harde to kepe theym beyng in flyght, specially the lower waye. And also of those, that hadde eskaped vnto the playne, they, whyche hadde bene at the siege frome the begynnynge, for that, that they hadde knowlaige of the places saued theymselfe in their campe. But they that were newly come, coulde not kepe the waye, but rather wente wandrynge throughe the feldes, who beyng parceyued by the horsemen their ennemyes, after that it was daye, were all slayne. The daye followynge the Syracusayns reysedde vp twoo Trophees, to wytt, the one at the entrynge of Epipole, and the othere in the place, where the Thebayns made the furste resistence. And the Athenyans, confessynge vnto theyme the victorye, demandedde their deade men whiche were in ryght greate nomber, but yet there was founde muche more harnnes, than there were deade people, for that, that those, whyche fledde in the nyght, by the smalle rockes, and were constraigned to leape frome a greate heighe downe, in manye places dydde caste of their harnes for to be more easye, whereby there were manye, whyche sauedde theymself.

               THys vnhoped victorye caused the Syracusayns to recouer and take agayne both herte and audacitie, as bifore tyme. whereby vnderstā

On the other syde Gylippus went by lande vnto the cyties of Sycille, for to demande of theyme renforte or newe succours of men, hopyng by meane therof, and for the victory, which the Syracusains had had at Epipole, to take the walles of the Athenyans by force. Duryng this time, the Dukes and chiefeste of the armye of the Athenyans were in greate sorowe, consideryng the ouerthrowe that they had receyuedde by the incomoditie of the campe, and of the armye whiche was in suche necessitie, that all generallye were greued and werye of that same siege, specially bycause that it was all full of maladies, and diseases, by twoo reasons. The one, for the seasone of the yeare, which was than moste subiected to diseases. The othere by reasone of the place, where the campe was, for there were marresses and lowe places, and in the reste verye incomodious. For the whiche reasones, Demosthenes was of opy
                     •
                  yon that men ought not to tarye there. For sithens that yt was my shappenedde of the enterpryse of Epipole, whyche he hadde made, yt semedde to hym better for to departe fromethence, than for to tarye there, forsomuche as the sea was than good, and by reasone of the shyppes whiche he hadde broughte, he was more stronge by sea, than the ennemyes. And on the othere syde ytt semedde vnto hym more conuenient and more necessarye to saylle for to defende their proper lande, where the ennemyes hadde enclosedde and fortefyedde a towne: than to consume the tyme and a greate quantytye of monney at the siege of a towne in a farre countrey, whereby there was no hope to take ytt. Suche was the opynyon of Demostthenes. But Nycyas, althoughe that he knewe all thies

difficulties, yett he
                     •
                   woulde not confesse theyme publiquely in tthat same assemblie, nother agree that the siege shoulde be reased and brokene of, fearynge leaste yt should comme to the knowlaige of the ennemyes. And moreouer he hadde yet somme hope, for that that he knewe the affaires of the cytie better than anny of hys collegues and compaignions, and considered that the length of the siege was more to the disaduantage of the Syracusayns than vnto theirs, for that that they consumedde so muche monney, markedde specially the greate armye, whiche they susteignedde by sea. And also that same Nycyas hadde secrete intellygence and confederation wyth some of the towne whyche wylledde hym secretly, that he shoulde not dislodge. For all the whyche respectes he maignteignedde the matter and interruptedde the opynyon of those, that woulde that the siege shoulde haue bene reysedde, attendynge what myghte chance, and sayed openly that men oughte not to breake yt, and that he would neuer consente therto forsomuche as he knewe welle, that if they shoulde doo yt wythoute lycence of the Athenyans, they woulde not be therewyth contentedde. And that those whyche shulde iudge vpon them whyder they hadde done wellle or euill, shulde not be of theyme that hadde bene in the campe, and that hadde sene the necessities of the armye: but they shoulde be othere people, whyche woulde not geue fayth to that, whyche the souldyars woulde saye: but soner to those, whyche shulde accuse theyme and charge theyme by sought or studyed meanes. And chiefly the moste parte of those same souldyars which were there and cryed that men ought to departe, whan they were retourned to Athens, would saye wholy otherwyse, to wytt, that they hadde not bene of the opynyon for to departe, but rather that the Dukes had bene corrupted for money, wherfore he, whiche knewe the nature of the Athenians, would not put himself in hazarde to be condempned, as slouthfull and naughty but he loued muche better to endure the danger of his parsone agaynste the ennemyes, if nede requyred it. And besydes that, he shewed thē that the ennemys were in muche woorse estate than they, forsomuch as they were at great charge and expences for to waage huyred souldyars and also for to enterteigne one so great an army by sea which they had already susteigned one whole yeare for to warde, and defende the townes of their allyance, & also were in great necessities of victuailles and of all other thynges, in suche sorte, that it shulde be impossible for theym to susteigne longer that charges. For he knewe for trouthe that they had already spente more than twoo thowsande talentes and also were yet in great debte, and that if they failled neuer so lytle in payment of the huyred souldiars, they shoulde be destroyed, for their force was more of estrangers than of their oune people, whiche thing was all otherwyse among them, wherfore he concluded that they oughtē to continue the siege and not to departe frome yt, as though they were most nedy and lacking monney, where as they were much better fournysshed therof. Suche was the speaking of Nycias, hauing for right certaine the necessitie of the ennemys, chiefly of monney, and also groundynge himselfe, vpon that, whiche, they, wyth whome he had intelligence and confederation in the towne, had required of hym, to wytt, that no man shulde remoue, and trustyng moreouer in the armye by sea whiche they than had muche more puissant, than whan that he was vainquisshed, bifore that the renforte or newe succours was arryued. Notwithstāding Demosthenes perseuered styll in hys opy
                     •
                  ion to reise the siege and for to departe fromthence into Grece. And although it was deuysed not to remoue out of the sayd countrey wythoute lycence, yet he was of opinyon that they shulde retyre to Thapsus or to Catana. Out of whiche places they myght come for to oueronne & pillage the lande of the ennemyes and well

enterteigne theymeself and also shoulde haue the sea at their commandemente for to be hable to goo and to comme and to fyght at their ease whan yt shoulde be requisitt, where as they were constraigned and locked vp aswelle by sea as by lande. And for conclusion, it semed not to hym that in any whatsoeuer manner, they shulde tarye longer there, but that they shulde incontinently departe withoute longer tarying Eurymedon agrede to his opinyon. But notwithstandyng that which he made, Nycyas caused the thynge to be delayed. And somuche the more, that it was ymagined that the same Nycyas, who had more knowlaige of thaffaire, than any of the other: woulde not haue cleued so vnto that same opynyon wythoute some greate reasone. And by that meane the armye remayned there stille. Durynge this, Gylippus and Sicanus dyd come agayne to Sarragosse, to wytt, Sicanus wythoute hauynge bene hable to do any thynge wyth the Agregantyns, for that, that he, beynge yet at Gela, the partie, whiche helde wyth the Syracusayns, had bene chased awaye by the other partie. But Gylyppus commynge frome the cyties of Sycille brought a greate nomber of men of warre out of the sayd countrey, and also those, whiche the Peloponesians hadde sente ymmediatly after the begynnyng of the sprynge tyme in the barques, whiche were descended at Selynūte, comyng out of Lybie, whither they were come to aboorde in that same voiage at their departure oute of Grece. And hauynge bene ayded and succoured by those of Cyrena, wyth two galleys, and twoo good Pilotes and maroners, were come to the succours of the Euesperites agay

That same succours being than arryued, the Syracusayns made theymeself eftsones ready for to assaille the ennemyes aswelle by sea, as by lande. On the other syde the Athenyans, seynge the succours that was come into the towne, and that their case proceded frome euyll into woorse, chiefly by the maladies which increased, more and more, they repented theymself greatly that they were not sonner dislodged. and also Nycyas dyd no more speake so stiflye agaynste it, but onely sayed that the cause ought to be kepte secrett. Accordynge vnto whose opynyon it was caused to be knowyn through all the armye the moste secretly that myght be, that they shoulde geue order to their case, for to dislodge, whan they shoulde heare the signe of dislodgynge. But in the meane tyme as they preparedde theymeselfe, a Clipse of the moone, beyng at the full, dyd happene, whyche thynge manye of the Athenyans dyd take, for an euyll pronostication and disswaded greatly to the Dukes for to departe. But aboue all Nycyas, who was greatly geuene to suche fantasies, made a greate matter therof, and sayed that they shoulde not in anny manner of the worlde departe vntylle .xxvii. dayes after, for suche was the counsaille and aduise of a stronomers and dy

                   they woulde dislodge, were so muche the more attentife and diligente for to lett theyme, that they shulde not departe. For insomuche as they enterprysed for to reyse vppe pryuely: yt was good to knowe that they parceiued themself the more feoble and weake both by lande, and by sea. And moreouer the Syracusains would not suffer, that at their departure fromethence, they shulde goo to lodge theymself in any place in Sycille, oute of the whyche they myght doo theym more euylle, than fromethence, where they were. For thys cause they deliberated to constrayne theym to fighte by sea ymmediatly as they shulde see their aduauntage, and so embarqued there men and causedde theym to tarye there certene dayes. The daye beynge come, whiche semedde vnto theym propice and mete, one parte of the men of warre yssuedde fourthe furste agaynste the walles of the Athenyans, and certaine of the warryours aswelle footemen as horsemen of the Athenenyans yssued fourthe by some of the poortes to mete theym, although that they were in a small nomber, by occasion wherof they were ryght sone repoulsed, and a certene nomber of the sayd footemen and .lxx horsemen or theraboutes of the Athenyans were taken and some of the other, and that done the Syracusayns retyred. The day followyng, they yssued fourth agaynst them by sea with .lxxvii. shyps, and came also by lande agaynst the sayd walles. On the other syde the Athenyans yssued by sea, with .lxxxvi. shyps in battaile, wherof Eurymedon hadde the ryght poyncte,Eurymedon. who coming to the conflict, went about to enuirone and compasse in the shyps of the Syracusayns, & that to do, he did put his poynct at large towarde the lande. By meane wherof those Syracusayns had better leasure for to charge vpon the Athenyans shyps that remayned in the myddest naked & destitute of the ayde of the sayd Eurymedone, & so did put them to flight after the aryualle, and afterwardes did come to geue charge vpon the ship of the sayed Eurymedon, whyche was inclosedde in a corner of the porte in the moste depthe, and so dydde sinke it wyth the sayd Eurimedon and with all the other that were wythi

great battaille: but fynally the Athenyans had the victorie and dyd slay a greate nomber of the other. And also saued one greate parte of their shippes, nothwithdinge there were .xviii. of them takene, and they that were wyth theym, slayne. And moreouer myndinge to burne the reste, they did fylle an olde Barque with drye woode, and wyth the other matter mete to fyer, afterwardes they sette it in waye towardes the sayde shippes, hauinge a good wynde, whiche dyd dryue the Barque into that same parte. But the Athenyans, seynge that danger, vsed suche diligence aswel to quenche the fyer, as to kepe of the sayd Barque, that they eskaped the same danger. For that same battalle, bo

The Athenyans parceyuinge the Syracusains, who at begynnynge were all afrayde of the succours, that Demosthenes had brought, to haue had one so greate victorie ouer them, were all therof astonyed, and dasshed out of couraige: fors

Whereby those same Athenyans could not hope to haue therin any partie of those that were wtin, nother through hatred of the comon gouernement secretly wyth them, nor also for to vainquish them easely, being aswell prouyded wyth all preparations of warre, as they, and by thies reasons they were not onely the more angry, but also in greate sorrowe for their affayre, and somuche the more they loste their courayge, that they parceyued themselfe to haue bene vainquished in that partie, wherof they doubted leaste: to wytt

And not for thys reason onely, it semed vnto theyme to be a laudable thynge to make theire strength for the intentes and endes, as is abouesayde, but also for thys, that in that doynge they shulde not onely vaynquishe the Athenyans: but rather many other their allyes, and also the vyctorie shulde not sarue for them onely, but for them also, whyche had bene aydynge vnto them.

And yet neuerthelas for that, that they were subiects of the Athenians, they were constrayned to come to this warre agaynst the Doryans. And besides this, the Eolians did come, amonge whome the Metymniens were not trybutairies, but only boūden to delyuer ships, but the Tenediens & the Aeniens were trybutairies.

And neuerthelas those of the sayd countrey of Arcadie, that were allyed, wyth the Corynthians, dyd holde those, that were wyth the Athenyans, for ennemys, and lykewyse those of Creto and of Ethosie, of whome there was of both sydes, all huyrlinges, in suche sorte that it chanced that the Cretes, that had builded the Cytie fo Gela with the Rhodyens, at that tyme were not for the Gelyens, but beinge waged by their enemyes, were against them. Some Acarnanyens also, aswell for hope of gaynes, as also for the amytie, whyche they had wyth Demosthenes, and for the affection that they had wt the Athenyans, tooke wages of them. And thies be they, that pursued the partie of the Athenyans in that same warre out of the coūtrey of Grece vntill the goulphe of Ionū. As touchinge the Italians, thider came the Thuriens and the Metapontins, who were comme into suche necessitie by their domesticall dissentiōs, that they wente to sarue in that warre for to gett wages, vnto whatsoeuer parte they were required. Of the Syciliens there were Naxiens & the Cataniens. And of Barbarous or estraungers, the Egestains, who had bene cause of that warre, and many othere, that inhabyted in Sycille. And of those, whych inhabited without Sycille, some of the Tyrrhenyens for that, that they were ennemyes of the Syracusains. For whose ayde on the contrary parte were furste the Camerins nygh neyghbours, and the Gelyans, whyche were further distante. As touching the Agrigentins that were their nexte neighbours they toke the contrary parte. After those same there were Selynuntyns, and all those, that kepe themselfe in the quarter of Sycille, whych is foranempste Lybia. And of those that be in the quarter of Thyrrenie, there were the Imeriens.Irenei who onely in that same quarter be of the natiō of Grece, also there came none other people out of the said quarter to the ayde of the Syracusains: but out of the whoole Islande dyd come all the Doryens, that were in their lybertie, and of Barbarours or estrangers, all those that had not takene parte wyth the Athenyans.

The Corinthiens sent vnto them shipps and men of warre whiche thinge none of the other dydde. For the Leucadyens specyally that were their allyes and parentes sent thider but men, and lykewyse the Ambracyens. Of the Ambracians there came those, whiche the Corinthians soulded or wages, & the Sycionyens, which were cōstrayned to sende thider. And of those, that be wtout Peloponese, the Beotiās did come thider.

Suche was the succours that came to the ayde of bothe the parties, whyche were there whan the battaille, whereof we haue aboue spoken, was made: and afterwardes, there dyd none other come thider from any other place. The Syracusains and theire allyes, beinge nowe gloryous and fyerce, for the victorie, whyche they had hadde: it semed vnto theym that it shulde be their greate honnour to destroye all that same armye of the Athenyans, whyche was so greate, and to kepe them from sauynge themself both by sea and by lande, and so they dyd fourthwyth enclose the mouth of the greate poarte, whyche conteygned aboute eight stades, wyth galleys, wyth Barques, and wyth all other sortes of shyppes, whiche they did putte into order by theire ancres, and fournyshed them wyth all thynges that was necessarye for to fight, if that the Athenyans woulde haue yssued fourth by force, and they prouyded for all thynges largely and dyligently.

And also they had no hope to recouer any more therof in any other place: except that they might defeate the armye of the enemyes by sea.

The whyche thynges beyng so determyned, were incontynētly executed and put in vre. For fourthwith they forsoke the furste walles that were nexte the Cytie, and descended towards the poarte: and caused to embarque all their people of whatsoeuer sort that they were suffycient and hable for to fyght: whyche were in all, and of sortes a houndred and tenne shippes, wythin the whiche, besydes the men of armes, and the Archers or casters of dartes, was wythdraw in all that they coulde gathere togyder, whereof they myghte haue nede. After that all thys was done, Nycias seynge hys warryours astonyed and discouraiged, for that, that contrary to their opynyon, and whooly contrary to that whyche had alwaies chanced vnto them before tyme, they had bene vainquished by sea, and that without hauinge prouision of victuaills were constrayned to take the hazarte against al the accustomed order, he caused them all to assemble and dyd speake vnto them in this manner

                  LOrdes Athenyans, and youe other our allyes, that be here, Thys battaille, that we muste presently make, ys common to vs all, for that, that euery man laboreth here for the welth of himself, & of hys countrey, lyke as also our ennemys do. For if we haue the vyctorie in thys battaille, that we muste make by sea, we maye retourne fromthence euerye one into hys countreye: wherefore we oughte to goo vnto yt ioyfully, and not to be astonyed and dyscouraiged, nother do, as men do that haue no experyence: who whan they bene vainquished in one battaille, haue no more hope to ouercomme: but rather thynke that it shall alwayes so chance vnto them. But youe, that be here Athenyans, men experymented in so many warres, and also youe other our allyes and perpetuall frendes: ought to consyder that the yssues and chances of warres, be vncertayne, and to thynke that the fortune may aswell comme in our fauour, as she hath bene of the other. And vpon thys hope, trustinge in the promes of so greate nomber of people, as youe be here, to prepare yourselfe to render vnto thennemys that, whyche they haue done to youe in theire former battaille: and so farre as toucheth vs your capytains and heddes, be ye assured and certayne that we omytt not to do any thynge, that may be necessary or conuenyent for the affayre, but rather hauynge regarde to the qualytie of the poarte, whiche is straicte, wherby at the other tyme, the disorder chanced vnto vs, and also to the castelles and tables of theire shippes, wherewyth they dyd greate euilles vnto vs, we haue prouyded for all wyth the patrons & capytayns of the ships, accordinge to the opyrtunytie of the tyme, the beste, that hath bene possible. And also we haue put wythin our shipps a multitude of Archers & slyngers of darts, muche more greate than we shulde haue done if we shulde haue fought at large in the sea: for that, that to kepe and obserue the discipline and order of the sea. yt is muche contrary to ouercharge the shippes wyth people: but that same shal be here proffitable for vs, forsomuche as we shall fyght in our ships as thoughe that we were on lande. And also we haue deuysed, that it is nedeful (for that, that we haue not had tyme to make agayne and tacle our shippes anewe, for to resiste the thickenes of the poyncts of theirs, and of the pieces of tymbe, that come fourth of theirs: whyche was the pryncypall cause of our ouerthrowe) to haue graspes of yrone, yf we maye fynishe them, for to fasten and wythholde theyme whan they shall comme to schocke vpon vs, to the intente that they shalle not

retyre. For we be brought vnto thys, that it is conuenyent for vs to fyght with our shipps, as if that we were in the mayne lande. Wherfore it is expedient that we do not disseuer ourselues from the shippes of our ennemys whan we shalbe ones assembled, and also that we suffre not theym to departe from ours, consydered specially that all the lande is our ennemye, resarued that same lytle parte nigh vnto the poarte, whyche we haue garnyshed wyth our people. The whiche thynges hauynge in memory, ye oughte to fyght so longe as youe shall haue aither force or strengthe, and not to suffre youreselfe to be repoulsed to the lande. And after that youe shall haue accroched any shippe, determyne not to suffre yt to eskape vntyll youe haue destroyed all the warryours wythin yt. And I exhorte youe all so to do, not onely the maronners: but also the men of armes, and somuche the more, that this is the worke rather of those that haue for to fyght in the shippes, than of those, that muste conducte and gouerne them: and for you it is conuenient to vainquishe at this instante, lyke as ye haue done many other tymes, fayghtinge on lande. And as touchinge youe maronners, I pray and requyre youe, that ye be not faynte harted nother discourayged for the losse, which youe haue made at the other battaille, seynge that youe haue greater preparatiō for warre in shyppes, than youe at that tyme had: and muche greater nomber of people, but rather be myndefull to go couraygyously to the busynes, and to repute yourselues woorthy for to conserue youre honnor. And those among you that be holden for Athenyans by the talke of the language, and also for the selfe fourme of lyuinge, though that ye be not of them, and by that meane haue bene in greate reputac

And by that meane ye shall come partly into the power of the Syracusains, agaynste whome ye know wel for what intent ye be come, and partly of the Lacedemonyans, whyche be wyth them. Wherfore beynge brought to suche termes or yssue that youe muste chose aither to vainquishe, or ells to come to this extremytie, I praye youe, that if euer in tymes passed youe haue shewed your vertue and hardynes, be wyllyng to parforce yourself to shewe it nowe, and to haue remembrance all togiders, and euery one for hymself, that here ys and lyeth all the armye by sea, all the shippes, all the force of men: and for effecte all the cytie, all the empyer: and fynallye, all the greate renomme of the Athenyans. For to warrante and defende all the whyche thinges, if there be any of youe, that excedeth and surmounteth the other, be he of

any industrie or experyence, or of hardynes, he shall neuer shewe himself in better tyme, than in this iourney, nor more vnto the nede of himself and of othere. After that Nycias had thus spoken, he caused his people incontynently to moūte into their shyppes, wherof Gylippus & the Syracusains were suffycyently aduertysedde for that, that they perceyued theyme wyth the eye to prepare for to fyghte: and were aduysedde of the graspes of yronne, that they dydde putt into their shyppes. Wherfore they prouyded themselfe of remedyes, aswell agaynste that, as also agaynste all the other preparations of the ennemys. For they couered the former parte, and the mooste parte of their deckes wt Copper, to the ende that the graspes shulde not fasten in them, but rather shulde slippe and slyde aboue of the copper. And after that all their case was putt in order, Gylippus and the other capytains exhorted their souldyars or warryours wythe thies or lyke woordes.
               
               
                  The exhortation of Gylippus and of the Syracusayns to their men at armes.
                  YOue knowe, Lordes Syracusains, and youe other oure frendes and allyes, that we haue hy
                        •

For yf that hadde not bene, youe shulde not haue bene so readye to haue employedde youreselfe therein. Neuerthelas leste there be anny that vnderstandeth not fullye the affayre, I wolle well declare yt vnto hym. The Athenyans came frome the begynnynge hyther to the intente to subdewe Sycille furste, yf they myghte, afterwardes Peloponese, and consequentlye the remanaunte of Grece. Who, albeit that they hadde a great and puissant Empyre, and that they hadde bene moore puissante than all the othere Grekes that hadde bene byfore thies, whyche presentlye be: yet youe haue many tymes vainquishedde theym by sea, whyche was whooly in their power: whyche thinge no man euer dydde, and yet at thys presente youe shall vaynquishe theym, as it is fullye apparante. For whan any people doo fynde theymselfe vainquished in the thynge, wherein they perswadedde themselfe to excede the othere, they loose greatelye theire reputatyon. And fromthensforwardes there opynion and hope ys therby lesser in themself, than yf they had not from the begynning had such presumption & confidēce. And perceyuynge themself depryued agaynst their opynyon of the glory, which they attrybuted to themself, the harte coueteth it yet more than the force, like as it is to be bileued that it is now chaūced to the Athenyans. And by the contrary, you that haue had the hardynes to resiste them by sea, although that youe had not greate practyse therin, be become more hardy for the opynyon, whyche youe haue conceiued through your prowesse. For this, that youe vaynquished theym, that were reputed ye most puissant & most exercysed therin, wherby youe oughte to haue double hope, which shall proffytt you greatly. For they that go to assaill in greate hoape, come vnto yt muche more ioyfully. And if our enemys haue lerned of vs to make the apparaylle and preparation of theire shyppes, as we had made ours at the other battaylle, the same oughte not to aba

And somuche as they shall put greater nomber of people in the Castelles and ouerlopps of their shypps, they shalbe the more oppressed, as in a battail by land. And also the Acarnaniēs & the other archers or darte casters shal not know how to aide them wt their darts & shot, being all bestowed & by that meane there thronged: & the greate nomber shal make their shyppes

vnprofytable and letting the one the other, shall put themself into disorder. And it maye helpe them but smally that they haue greater nomber of shyppes than we, nother youe oughte for that to be estonyed.

bringinge moreouer to their remembrance the lybertie of their countrey, which was the frankest that was knowen, and where euery one myght lyue at his wil wythout beynge subiecte to the commandement of any parson: and many other thynges, which in suche case haue bene accustomed to be spoken by men caryed here and there, wythout hauing regarde to speake the thinge that men mighte iudge to be autentique and profounde, but as people estonyed do speake wt great exclamation that, which semeth to sarue in their case, not remembring therin the danger of their wiues, of their children, of their temples, and such other thinges, as people of vertue haue accustomed to speake. And after that he had spoken all those wordes, the whiche he alwayes reputed more necessary than suffycient, he went with theym and ledde the footemen to the shoare of the sea: and so caused theym to kepe the beste order that he coulde, for to geue couraige to those, that were within the shippes. And Demosthenes, Menander and Eurymedon that were chiefest of the armye by sea, made with their shippes straight to the mouth of the poarte: the which the ennemys had already garnished and possessed, to the intente to breake the order of the sayde ennemys, and for to skatter their shippes for to gett into ye depth of the sea. But on the other side, the Syracusains & their allyes came in a manner wyth a lyke nomber of ships, partly against the mouth of the saide poarte, and partly aboute the same, for to empesche them on all sides, hauynge moreouer their footemen in the shoore of the sea for to succour theym to whatsoeuer parte theire sayde shippes shulde come to lande. Nowe Sicanus and Agatharcus, whyche kepte the twoo poinctes, were Capytayns of the army of the Syracusains, to wytt, of the ryghte and the lefte, and in the myddest were Pythen and the Corinthyans. The Athenyans than as they came to the mouth of the poarte, at the furst arryuall repoulsed the shippes, which were there ioygned togiders: for to defende them not to yssue, and parforced themself to breake their lyens and chaynes, wherwyth they were fastened togiders. But the Syracusains and their allyes came on all sydes to russhe vpon them, not in the mouth of the poarte onelye, but euene throughe wythin the same. And so the combate was mooste cruell and moore dangerous, than annye of the othere former had bene: and men did heare the cryes of the chiefest and capytains, that comaunded the maronners to saile wyth greate strength. And euery one on his side enforced himself to shewe his arte and hys industrye, and lykewyse the men of warre, that were in the castells and vpon the deckes of the shippes, parforced themself to do their endeuour, aswell as the maronners, and for to kepe wel and defende euery one the place, that was appoyncted to hym. But forsomuche as the combate or battaille was made in a veraye strayghte and narrowe place, for that, that there was both of the one syde and of the othere fewe lesser than two houndred ships, whiche foughte togiders all wythin the porte or in the mouth therof, they could not oftene come wyth greate strengthe o

                      oares, the one to the other. For none hadde meane to retyre nor to recharge themself, but rather dyd myngle the one shyppe wyth the other, so as they encountred, were it in flyinge or in assaulting. And as oftenne as the one shyppe assaultedde the othere, those, that were in the Castelles and planchers of the same, did caste plenty of dartes, shott and stoanes the one agaynste the othere: but as they ioygned themselfe togyders, they came to fyghte hande to hande, and enforcedde themself to enter the one into the ships of the othere, whyche thynge chancedde in many of them, for that the place was narrowe: and in some places there were twoo agaynste one through constraynct, & the gouernours and patrones studyed the one to warre vpon those of thennemys, and the other to defende theirs, and that not by courses or tourns one after

the other, but all at one istant and on all sydes, wherby the bruytt was so great and maruaillous, that it was great horror and feare vnto those, whyche dydde fight, and also they coulde not vnderstande, the one the other, although that the Chiefe and Capytaynes of the one syde and of the othere made exhortations to theire people, aswell for sylence, as also for the instructione of the sea and for the greate ardor and desyre that euery one hadde for to vaynquishe. For the Athenyans cryedde to theire men, that they shulde breake the order and the bandes of the shyppes that stoppedde the yssue of the poarte, and yf that euer they hadde had vertue or couraige, they shulde shewe yt at the same houre, if they hadde care for theire proper wealthe and to retourne into their countrey. And the Syracusains, and their allyes declaredde vnto theirs, that it was the howre for to shewe their vertue for to defende that the ennemyes shulde not saue theymselfe and for to consarue and encrease the honnoure and glorye of theire nation. And the Capytaynes themselfe whan they parceyued anny to goo slackelye, or those that were wythin, not to do their endeuour: they called the patrones by their names, and demaunded, to wytt, the Athenyans, whider that it semed vnto them that the lande, whyche was the mooste ennemy that they hadde in the worlde, were more suer, than the sea, which they myght get and purchase wythin a short tyme. And the Syracusains, whider that they wolde flye before those, that did not fyght, but only for to flye away thēself, in whatsoeuer maner that it were. In the meane tyme, that this combate or battaille was made by sea, those, that were on lande at the shoore of the sea, were in greate and dyuers thoughtes and fantasies. For the Syracusains parceyued that it was questyon of gettinge muche more greate honnour, than they thoughte on from the beginning. And the Athenyans feared, leste it shulde yet chaunce vnto them woorser, than to them that were in the sea, for that, that all their baguages were in the shippes, whiche they feared maruayllously to lose, and howe muche the more the combate or battail was variable and the victorie vncertayne, they were constrayned to haue dyuers opynyons, & to make dyuers countenances or gestures. For beinge so nygh, that they might see manyfestly: those, that did see in any poinct their people, that had the better, lifted vp their handes to heauon, and prayed the goddes wyth a lowde voyce, that they woolde not defraude nor frustrate them to the victorie. And to the contrarye, those, that dyd see theirs to be vaynquished, dyd wepe wyth complayncte and pytuous cryes. And whan the combate was doubtful and sharpe, so that one coulde not iudge, who shulde haue the woorste therof, they made gestures and signes wyth the body suche as their desyre imported, as though that, helped their men, for feare that they hadde, leaste they shulde lose: and for effecte they did almoste suche actes wyth their bodies, as if they themself had foughten, and they were in the selfe sorowe, as they that did fighte. Also they perceyued in that same conflict many, that for a small occasyon saued thēself, where they were discomforted. And specyally the Athenyans, being on lande, so long as their men did fyghte hande to hande in the sea, perceyued not onely the combate or faightinge, but forsomuche as they were nighe, they hearde distinctlye, the complainctes, lamentations and clamors, aswell of those that vaynquishedde as of them, that were ouercome: & all other lyke thyngs that men might see and heare in a ryght sharpe conflicte of twoo puissant hoastes. And those, that were in the shippes had and suffred besyde the combate, the lyke sorrow and trauaille, Fynally after that the storme had longe endured, the Syracusains and theire allyes did put the Athenyans to flyght, and as they did see them tourne the backe, with great cryes, and wyth greate force they chased them vnto the lande. And those

of the Athenyans that myght saue and caste themself on lande, wth the most dyligence that they coulde, they retyred into their campe. And lykewyse those, that were on lande, seinge that there was no more hope, wt great cryes, wepinges and lamentations they ronned all at one instant, some to the ships, for to saue them, the other, to the walles, whyche they yet did kepe, the other and the more parte was in doubte of their lyfe, and regarded on all sides, howe & where they might saue themself. And shortly the feare and the fraye was so greate at that same instant, that neuer before that tyme, they had had the lyke. And the Athenyans did suffer and receue woorthely, that, whyche they had caused the Lacedemonyans to suffer and receue at Pylus: where, after that they had vainquished the armye by sea of the same Lacedemonyans, they destroyed them. And as the Lacedemonyans dyd than enter into the Islande, euen so the Athenyans retyredde at thys tyme to lande, wythout hauinge alwayes any hope for to saue themselfe, except that it were by some case or meane vnthought on.

               AFter thys so sharpe and cruell a battaille, wherein there was greate nomber of shippes takene and destroyed, and of men slayne: The Syracusains and other their allyes hauinge the vyctorie, recouered the shippwrackes and the deade bodies, and beinge retournedde into the towne, they dyd reyse vp their trophee. As concerning the Athenyans, they were so astonied of the euilles that they hadde sene, and did see byfore their eyes, that they had no mynde for to requyre the shippwrackes and dead bodyes, but only studyed howe they myghte incontynently saue thēself that presente night, wherby they were in dyuers opynyons. For Demosthenes was of aduyse that they shulde embarque themselfe in the reste of the shippes, whiche were lefte them, and that they shulde at the breake of the day eskape through the selfe poarte yf they myghte. For they had yet greater nomber of shippes, than the ennemys, to wytt, aboutes .lx. where the ennemyes had but fyftie. To the whyche counsaille and aduyse, Nycias agrede. But whan they woulde haue caused the people to be embarqued, the maronners refused yt, for the feare, whiche they yet had of the combate, wherin they had bene vaynquished, and yt semed not to them that they coulde any more haue better, wherfore they were forced to change opynyon, and all wyth one accorde determined to saue theymselfe by lande. Hermocrates the Syracusayne doubted greatly the same:Hermocrates. and therfore consyderyng that yt shuld be a dangerous thinge, if one suche an hoste dyd retyre aud ioygnedde togider agayne in any parte on lande, wherby they might begynne a new warre: he wente vnto the officers of the towne and sayde to them, that there ought to be hadde good regarde that same night, vnto the departure of the ennemys: declaring vnto them by many reasons, the dangers, which might therby happene. And that it semed to him that all the men that were in armure in the towne, aswelle of the countrey, as strangers shuld yssue fourth and go to gett the passages, by whiche the saide Athenyans myght saue themself. And of that same opynyon were the othere, knowinge that he dyd say the trouthe: but they consydered that the compaignyons, which had fought all the day, were trauaylledde and desyred rest and

therfore wold not wyllingly obey vnto that, whiche shulde be commaundedde them touchinge the same, and somuche the lesse as the morowe followyng was the feaste of Hercules, in the whyche were prepared great sacryfices for to render vnto hym thankes for the same so greate a victorie: which doynge many, accordynge to the custome, were mynded to reioyce and refreshe themself by eatinge and drynkinge: wherefore, any other thinge shulde haue bene moore easy to perswade them, than to yssue fourth that same day in armure, for ye which reasons, they agrede not to the opynyon of Hermocrates: who, seinge that he coulde not brynge them vnto it, and consyderynge that the ennemyes that same nighte by retyrynge, might gett the passages of the mountaigns, which were stronge and difficille, deuysed one suche a sutteltie. For he sente some of hys compaignyons horsmen very nighe vnto the campe of the Athenyans, so that they myghte well heare them and faygninge to be of those of the towne that affectioned the Athenyans (wherof there were many that certefied newes to Nycias) and that they were come thider for to do it, saide that it was to be signefied vnto him, that he shuld not remoue for that night. For the Syracusayns, had garnished the passages so, that in the night there shuld be danger therin for the disorder of his men
                     •
                   but the daye beinge come, marchinge in battaille and in good order, they might more easely get the same passages. Those, whyche had hearde thies words, sent them to the Dukes and capytayns of the campe. who, not thinkinge that there had bene any deceite therin, determyned for to soiourne there that same nyght, & also the morowe followynge. So they did it to be knowin to all the warryors, that they shuld ordeyn and make ready all their case for to departe wythin two dayes, wtout carying any thing but only that, which shuld be necessary for them for the vsage of their parsonnes. During thys tyme Gylippus, and the Siracusains sent to fournishe the passages, by the whyche they thought, that the sayde Athenyans shuld passe. And specially at the passage of the ryuers, they sett good garnysons, and also lykewyse in the other straight or narrowe places. On the other syde, those of the towne issued fourth into the porte, & recouered the shippes of the Athenians, wherof they burned some: which thinge those same Athenians had bifore determyned to do & of the other, euery man did take, what he woolde & wi

After that, Nycias & Demosthenes, hauing ordeined their case, as they did thinke good, departed fromthence the fourth day after the battaill, which was a thing right greuous & right heauy to them all, not only for this, that they had lost all their ships, & that frō a great hope, which they had had in ye beginning for to subdue that same cūtrey, they were brought into a great danger, aswell of themself as of their cytie: but also for thys, that it was an harde & myserable spectacle or sight to forsake their campe and their baguages, wherby their harts and all their spirits were ouercōme and adnichillated, and thought made thē right heauy and astonyed. And on the other parte their cōpaignions being dead, and remayning in the feide wtout buryal, whan they did se any of thē, that brought them horrour, sorowe and feare: but they had yet more compassion of the hurt, lamed and of ye sicke men, whiche they lette, thinking that they were moore vnhappy, than those that were dead. Also the poore and miserable, perceyuinge the other to departe, did wepe and crye, prayinge their compaignions by their names, that they wold carye them awaye
                     •
                   and whan they dyd see any of their parentes, domesticall or specyall frendes, they followedde and kepte theyme backe the mooste that they myghte. And whan they coulde not followe theyme furthere they cryedde and wepte, blaiming and cursynge them. So that all the hoaste was full of sighings

and teares, wherby the departure was greatly, and muche retarded. Although that considerynge the greate euylles, whiche were chanced vnto theym, and that they feared to come vnto theyme, dyd putt theyme into greate sorowe and care, and muche more yet than they made semblante for. And besydes this that they were all sorowfull and afrayde, they were moreouer angry, the one agaynst the othere. And in a totall some they were all as people, that fledde oute of a ryghte greate cytie, whiche had bene taken by force, for they were all togider whan they departed, aboutes, Foortye thousande, wythoute speakynge of maroners and of thother, who, caryedde euery man that, whyche he myght. The men of armes aswelle on foote, as on horse, caryed euery man the victuailles vnder their harnnes (whyche was a thynge, that they had not accustomed, the one for feare that they coulde not recouer it, and thoder for faulte of varlettes and esklaues, for the moste parte of them were fled to the ennemyes, partly already bifore that time, but the most parte after that same ouerthrowe. And also the victuailles whiche they taryed were not suffyciente for their necessitie, for that, that it welle nyghe failled them in the campe. And although that in other places, and othere tymes, such darthe and skarcenes myght be somewhat tollerable for that, that it is comon and egall as muche to the one, as to the othere, and is not accompaignedde wyth myschief: yet to those there, it was somuche the more greuous, whan they considered the glory wherin they had bene, and the mysery and desolation wherunto they were fallen.

And where they departed out of their coūtrey wyth great melodie of ioyfull songes, of diuers instrumentes, making greate vowes for the victory, wherof they had suer hope: they all retourned fromethence mournynge and makyng pituous groanes, and all other contrary thynges, for that, that the maroners, whiche were come to saille by sea, were than on lande, renked with the footemen, neuerthelas, all thynges were tollerable vnto theyme, for the greate danger, wherin they parceyued theymself to be brought. Whome, Nycyas parceyuynge so discomforted and faynte harted, dyd goo comforting theym againe, and declarynge vnto them many thynges, saruynge to the case, so as he founde them assembled togider, cryinge vnto theyme more, with a loude voyce, than by manner of exhortacion or declaration, for to cause theyme to recouer their couraige and for to proffytt them in the estate wherein they were, as he knewe well to do. And so did speake vnto them theis or suche woordes.

For many haue eskaped muche greatter mischief and danger than this same is, wherin we be. Wherfore you ought to take greater couraige, not blaymynge yourself beyonde reasone, be it for the losse that you haue made, or be it for the shame, whiche you endure. For as for me, I am in nothing in better condition, than any of youe the other be, nother in force, for that, that ye may see howe that I am weakened with my disease: nother yet in goodes. For thoughe that herebifore I was well prouyded of victualles, and also of other necessaris: yet as this presente, I haue no greater prouision thereof, than the leaste of the bende. Howbeit forsomuche as I haue made greate sacrefices to the goddes and vsed greate goodnes and curtesie to men, ytt geueth me yet audacytie to hope welle hereafter. But I do see you estonyed and

afrayed to much more than ys conuenient to the dignitie and condition of your parsons, for the euylls and damages whiche youe haue receyuedde, the whyche peraduenture shall amende. For our ennemyes haue had ynough, both of felycitie and also of good happe. And if anny God hath bene angry, and displeased towardes vs, for that, that we be come hider to make warre, we haue bene suffyciently and to muche ponysshed. And it hath bene hertofore oftentymes sene of people, that came to assaille other in their houses, that hauynge done their indeuour in warre, haue neuerthelas hadde tollerable mysfortunes and inconueniences: wherfore we ought to hope that God woll doo better for vs hereafter, for that, that we desarue better to haue mercy of hym than vengeance. In the reste youe ought to consider the force of youre self, what nomber youe be and in what appareille of armure, and to perswade yourselfe, that in whatsoeuer parte ye be togiders, you euene youe haue beatene yourselues, & that in whatsoeuer cy

And also it is conuenyent for to continue and auaunce our iourney a day and a nyght without arrestynge vs, for we lacke victuailles. And after that we shall haue aryued in whatsoeuer towne of this countrey, we shalbe in suertie, for that that they shall perseuer in our amytie and allyance, for the feare whiche they haue of the Syracusayns.

On the morowe in the mornynge they departed aboute breake of the daye, and after that they had iourneyedde aboutes .xx. stades
                     •
                   they descended into a playne, and there logded themself that same daye, aswell for to take some victuailles, and howsen that were there, for that, that the place, was inhabyted: as also for to take freshe water for to carye wyth theyme, for in all the waye, whiche they had passed, they founde but lytle therof. In thys meane tyme, the Syracusayns aduansed themself to gett an othere passage, by the whiche, it was conuenient for the sayd Athenyans to passe, whyche was a veray hyghe rocke, that was hangyng, and not to be come vnto, on two sydes, wherof the toppe was named Lepas. The morowe after, those same Athenyans, and their allyes, beinge in the waye, were eftesones greatly troubled, by the horsemen and archers, or darte casters of the ennemyes (wherof they had greate nomber) whiche came chasynge, and assayllynge theym by the sydes, so that skarcely they coulde iourney. And fynally after that they had fought a longe tyme, they were constrayned, to retyre into the same place, fromwhence they were departedde, but wyth muche greater disaduantage, for they founde there no victuailles, and also the lodging, was not so easye, as yt had bene the daye precedynge, for the oppression, whiche the ennemyes dydde make agaynste theyme. And neuerthelas, the morowe in the mornynge, they toke eftsones the waye, and whatsoeuer empeschemente the sayedde ennemyes made agaynste theym, they passed further vntyll the sayed passage, whiche they founde closed with wall, and aboue vpon the same a greate bende of footemen, bearyng the moste parte shieldes and targettes, and though the place was very straight, yet the Athenyans marched fourth straight, and trauaylled themself for to gett yt by force. But being repoulsed by the greate nomber of ennemyes, that were in the aduantagious place, to wytt, on hygh on the rocke, fromwhence they might the more sturdely, cast their dartes and their shott: they were constreyned to retyre and plante themself there, without doing any thyng, for that chiefly that in that same warre, there was greate thondrynges & rayne, lyke as comonly it dyd in the same countrey after ye haruest tyme, which was already bigon, wherof they were greatlye astonyed, and somuche the more, that they iudged, that the same was a prenostication of their destruction. Gylippus than perceyuynge that they were planted there, he sent one partie of his men by a syde waye, for to reyse vppe soubdainely a wall, in the waye, wherethrough the Athenyans were come, to the ende to enclose theym at their backes, but they, that parceyuedde it, sente thider a a bende of theirs, which empesched and repoulsed theym: and that done they also retyred nigh to a felde, which was nigh to that same passage, where they soiourned that same night. The day following, they being eftsones in the waye, the Syracusayns and Gylippus came to charge vpon thē on all sydes, and so dyd hurte many of them. And whan the same Athenyans charged vpon them they retourned. And as they were retourned backe, and put themself to iourney, they came afreshe to charge on the hyndermost, wherby they did hnrte many of them for to cause the whole army to reste and tarye, but euery man defending best himself, against the charginges, iourneyed from fyue to sixe stades, vntyll they came vnto a felde, where they rested, and the Syracusains retourned fromthence into their campe. Nycyas and Demosthenes, parceyuing than that their case was in euyll state and condition, aswell for lacke, whiche they generally had of victuailles, as also for the greate multitude, whiche they hadde of their hurte people, and that

they alwayes had, the ennemyes bifore on all sydes, whiche cessed not to assaille them, they determyned to goo fromethence that same nyght secretly, not by the way whiche they had bigonne, but by an other clene contrarye leadynge vnto the sea, whiche did go crokedly, frome Catana to Camerin and towardes Gela, and certen other cyties whiche be wholy apposit or directly the one against the other, and of the other syde of Sycille, aswell Grekes, as barbarous. And so they didde lighten greate fyers in dyuers places through their campe for to cause the ennemyes to vnderstande, that they moued not. But as it chanceth alwayes in suche case whan a great hoste dislodgeth it self for feare, chiefly in the nyght, and in the countrey of ennemyes, and also hauing them veray nygh, all the campe was generally in greate feare, terror and tumulte. Neuerthelas Nycias, who had the former warde with his men, departed furst keping good order, and he iourneyedde a good space bifore the other, but one partie of the bende, which Demosthenes conducted, and as in a manner the moytie therof, skatered abroade and dyd breake their order in their passing. Notwtstanding they iourneyed somuche, that at the breake 
                     •
                  f the daye, they were at the sea syde, and did take away which was named Elorū,Helorina. alongest that same sea, by whiche they would haue gone vnto the ryuer of Cyparis, & afterwardes a longest the same,Caciparis. through the high countrey, keping thēself farre of frō the sea, hoping yt the Syracusains whom they had demanded to come to mete the, would haue come to encountre thē there. But they being arryued at the ryuers syde, founde that there was a certene nomber of mē, which the Syracusains had sent thider for to kepe & defende that same passage, whiche had stopped the other syde of the water, with paales & with rampares for to empesche and lett the shallowe passages, howbeit they were fewe people, and were incontinently repoulsed by the sayd Atheniās, who hauing passed that same ryuer, iourneyed vnto an other ryuer yt is called Erineus,Erineus. keping the waye that the guides had taught & appoyncted for thē. Duryng this time, ye Syracusains & their allies, whan the day was come, vnderstanding yt the Atheniās were departed frōthence in the night, were veray angry, and had suspicion yt Gilippus had bene consenting to their departure, & yet neuerthelas did put thēself in waye for to poursue the sayd ennemys with all diligence following their tracke, which was right easy to knowe, so that they did ouertake them about the houre of dynner. And the furste that they founde were those of the bende of Demosthenes, who being troubled in the iourney, which they had made that same night, wente most softly and wtout great order, and so the former of the Syracusains did begyn to eskarmouche against them & with their horsemen, who enuironed them incontinently on all sydes & constrayned theym for to ioigne togiders all in one place. And somuch the more that they were already separated into two bendes, for that, ye Nycias who knewe well yt it was no time to arrest therefor to fyght, was wt his bende alredy bifore him more than a houndred & fifty stades, & caused his men to auaūce forwardes the most that they myght wtout arres

But Demosthenes coulde not do so, for that, yt he was empesched by manye meanes, insomuche as he was departed out of his lodging after the other, and insomuche as he had the artiere warde, he was ye furst yt the ennemys, shulde haue assailled. For this cause he was cōstrayned to geue himself asmuche to kepe his mē ready to fight, being aduertised yt the Syracusains
followed thē, as also to cause thē to passe on their way, in such sorte, yt by slacking his iourney, he was ouertakē by his ennemys, wherof he & his people were afrayde & astonyed. And somuch the more yt he was ouertaken in a place, that was enuironed with rampars, and in a way where there was Olyue trees on euery syde, whereby they were incontinently troubled wt stroakes

And on the other parte knowyng to haue already almoste the victorye in their handes, they feared to cōmyt any faulte. For it semed well vnto them that wythout faighting in rancked battaille, in suffrynge by suche meanes thei

Hauing than escharmouchedde by suche meane all the daye wyth strokes of dartes, and knowyng that they were discouraiged, an heraulte was sente vnto theym frome Gylippus, the Syracusayns and their allyes. Whiche did furste to vnderstande, that if there were any of the Islanders cyties that would wythdrawe and come to them, he shuld be saued. Whereupon there were some bendes that withdrewe theymeself, but veray fewe. And afterwardes the lyke offer was made vnto Demosthenes, that to all those, that woulde putt of their armure, lyfe shulde be saued, and shulde not be put into close prysone, nothere any necessitie of victuailles, the whiche partie they all dyd accepte, whiche were founde aboute sixe thousande and at the arryuall, euery man consigned and delyuered the monney, whiche he hadde, the whiche they layde downe wythin foure crownes beynge vppermoste, wherof they had plentie. And fourthwith they were ledde vnto Sarragosse. Duryng this tyme, Nycyas had iourneyed all that same day to the ryuer, Erineus, hauing passed the whiche, he was lodged vpon an high hille, verye nigh vnto yt. In the whiche place he was, the morowe after, ouer takene by the Athenyans, who signefied vnto him, that Demosthenes, and his men had rendred themself, admonysshynge hym to do the lyke, whereunto Nycyas woulde not geue sayth or creditt, but demanded them that they shulde be contente that he might sende one of his horsemen for to brynge the trewe repoarte thereof vnto hym, whyche they graunted vnto hym. And afterwardes beyng infourmed by hys sayd horsemen, he sent to shewe vnto Gylippus, and the Syracusains that he was content to make appoynttment wyth them in the name of the Athenyans, if they would suffer him to passe with his men, to wytt, to render and repaye vnto them all the charge, that they had made in that same warre and thereupon to delyuer them for hostages a certene nomber of Athenyans, whom, repaying the sayd monney: they would buy a gayne at a talent for euery hedde. But Gylippus and the Syracusains would not accept the said partie, but they assailled them with stroakes of dartes on all sydes so longe as the daye endured. And notwithstandyng that they were by that meane euyll entreated and also in necessitie of victuailles, yet they determyned to departe fromthence that same night
                     •
                   and had already taken their armure for to marche, whan they vnderstoode that the ennemyes had parceuerance therof by the signe of the battaille, which they had caused to be geuen in their campe. So they did putt their armure of, except three houndred or theraboutes, whiche passed by force, ouerthwart the watche of the sayd ennemys hopyng to saue theymself for that night. The daye beynge come, Nycyas toke hys iourney with his men. But as he did begynne to marche, the ennemyes assailled him with hande stroakes and with shott on all sydes, as they had done, the daye precedynge. And yett neuerthelas susteigninge the stroakes, aswelle of the sayed dartes and arrowes, as also of horsemen, they iourneyd still further, hopynge to get ye ryuer of Assinaris,Assinarus. aswel for that, that it semed, that the same being passed, the shulde goo in more suertie, as also for to drynke, for they all were troubled, wyth thurste.

                  forced themself for to lett them to passe, wherby the disorder was veray greate, forsomuch as in passing soubdainly and in a greate trowpe, the one empesched the other aswelle with their parsones, as with their harnois & weapons. So that ye one dyd soubdainely swymme, and the othere were so entermedledde togither, that the ryuer dyd carye theym awayt, and the ennemyes whiche kepte both the sydes, whiche were veray high pursued theym on all sydes, with stroakes of dartes, and wyth hande. In manner that a greate nomber of theyme were slayne, specyally of the Peloponesyans, who rested in the depeste of the water, for to drynke the better at their ease. By meane wherof the water was incontynently troubledde, aswell with bloude of those, that were hurte, as with the mudde whiche they remoued by passing. And yet neuerthelas they ceased not to drynke for the greate thurste, that they had, but rather they did fight amongest theymeselfe for drynke, where they dyd see the water moste clere. Fynally the ryuer beynge replenysshed wyth deade men, whiche tombled the one vpon the othere, and all that same armye destroyed, to wytt, some by the ryuer, and the other that were eskaped by the horsmen: Nycias rendred hymself vnto Gylippus, trusting more in him, than in the Syracusayns. And submytting himself to the will of hym, and of the other Peloponesians, he prayed hym that he woulde not suffre, the othere men of warre, whiche were not yet deade, to be slayne. Whiche thyng Gylippus graunted vnto hym: and defended, that no man shoulde slaye anny more of the Athenyans, but that they shulde be takene prysoners. And so all those, that were not hydde (of whome was a greate nomber) were taken prysoners, and the three houndredde whiche were skaped in the night, were lykewyse taken by the horsemen, whyche were afterwardes sente vnto them, but whan they were all togiders, there was no greate nomber, of them. For the most parte vnclothed theymselfe and fledde fromthence by diuers wayes, whereby all Sycille was replenyshedde, for that, that they rendred not themself by composition, as those with Demosthenes: but a greate partie of them did dye. And in effecte, that same slaughter was so great or greater than any other that had bene made in Sycille at any tyme bifore durynge that same warre. For besydes those, that were slayne by faightynge, there was a greate nomber, slayne in flyinge by the wayes, orelles so hurte, that afterwardes they dyed, neuerthelas many dyd saue theymself, some that same daye, and the other the nyght followynge, the whiche retyred into Catana. The Syracusayns than and their allyes, hauyng takene of the prysoners, the moste that they myght, retyred to Sarragosse, being arryued at which place, they sente the prysoners into an castelle, namedde Litothomia,Litothonia. the whiche they reputedde the strongest and most suer of al the other, that they had. But they soone caused Demosthenes & Nycyas, to dye against Gylippus will. Who reputed, that it shulde haue bene greate honnour vnto hym, and for greate glorye besydes the victory, at his retourne to bryng the Dukes of the ennemyes prysoners to the Lacedemonyans, whereof the one had bene their mortell and sharpe ennemye at the ouerthrowe of Pylus, and the other had bene frende and fauourable vnto theym in the self matter. For whan the Lacedemonyans, that were takene at Pylus, were brought to Athens, Nycias purchased their delyuerance of his power, and vsed all the humanytie that he coulde, and moreouer he purchased the appoinctmente, bitwene the Athenyans, and the Lacedemonyans, so farre as he myghte. whereby those same Lacedemonyans did beare hym loue, which was the cause, wherfore he rendredde himself vnto Gylippus. But some of the Syracusayns,

whiche had intelligence and confederation wyth hym durynge the siege, fearing leste that by torment

                  s he shulde be constrayned to tell the trouth thereof, lyke as the bruytt was, and that by the same meane in the prosperitie of the victory, some newe brabblyng shulde chance in the cytie: and the other, specially the Corynthyans, doubtynge that by plenty of monney, considerynge that he was verye ryche, he shoulde wynne and corrupte the kepars, and by that meane eskape, and afterwardes make newe warre agaynste theym: they perswaded so vnto all the allyes, that yt was concluded to putt him to death. For suche or the veray nigh lyke cause, Nycias was slayne, a man of all those, that hath bene of my tyme, that least desarued it, for that, that al the mischief that had happened to him, was for hys vertues, wherein he dyd bestowe and applye all hys mynde. As touchyng the prysoners, that were ledde and caryed into Lythotomie, they were veray rudely entreated at the begynnynge. For beynge in so greate nomber in a lowe and narrowe place beynge opene, they were destroyedde, furste wyth the heate of the sonne in somer, and afterwardes Antumpne commynge, by cause of the nightes, whiche beganne to be colde, by the soubdayne change of the tyme: they felle into greate diseases, ioigned, that in the same straight place, wherein they were all togiders, they were constrayned to doo all their necessites, and chiefly those that dyedde, aswell of woundes as of sickenes, were all there buryed the one wyth the other, whereby the stenche was intollerable. And besydes thys, they hadde greate skarcytie of drynke and of meate, for they had but two smalle loaues a daye, and a smalle measure of water euery man. And in effecte, they suffred and endured all the euylles in that same place, that is possible to suffre in that same case, the space of, lxx, dayes. Afterwardes, they were all solde, resarued certene nomber of them whiche were Athenyans, and a certene small nomber of Italians, & of Sicilians, whiche they founde to haue bene in their compaignie. And although that yt be difficille to shewe the nomber of all theyme whiche for trouth were prysoners, yet it is full certene that they were more, than seuen thousande. Which was the greatest losse that the Grekes had made in that same warre, and for that, that I can haue learnedde (aswelle by heare saye as also by histories) that euer bifore tyme had bene made. Whereby the acte was more glorious to those, that hadde the victorye, and more miserable to theym that were ouercomedde. The whiche beynge wholy and in all sortes destroyed and wyth greate losse in all partes, remayned so as yt is sayde, destitute both of footemen and of shyppes. And of one so greate nomber of men of warre, that there were but veray fewe, that retourned fromthence into their countrey. Such was the yssue of the warre of Sycille.

               Of the prouision whiche the Athenyans made, hauyng vnderstanded the destruction of their people in Sycille, for to susteigne warre agaynste the Peloponesians, and howe the more parte of Grece, togiders with the kynge of Persie, dyd reallye themself togiders against the sayd Athenyans. ☞The furst Chapter.
               WHan the newes of the same ouerthrowe and destruction did come to Athens, there was not well nigh one parson, that would almost bileue them, though afterwardes those, whiche were come and skaped fromthence, did witnesse it. For it semed vnto them impossible, that one such an army might haue bene so vtterly destroyed. But after that the trouth was lerned, the people beganne to enter into fury and into greate anger against the Oratours, which had perswaded that same enterpryse, as though they themself had not determyned it, and lykewise agaynst the Augurers, and diuinours, whiche had done them to vnderstande that the same en
                     •
                  erpryse shulde be fortunate and that they shulde subdue all Sycille. And for effect besyde the sorowe and displaiser, that they had for the same losse, they were in greate feare, for that, that they parceyued themself depriued, aswell in particuler, as in generall of a greate compaignie of good warryours, aswell fotemen as horsemen and of the moste parte of their yonge men, better than they had annye left of them. And also they had no shyps in their hauone, nother monney in their treasure, nor maroners ne workemen for to make newe shyps, and for effect they were in a totall despeir of their welth. For they did thynke that the army by sea of the ennemys, that shoulde retourne out of Sycille, would come straicte for to aryue at their porte of Pyrreus, hauing had so great a victory, and hauing their force doubled by the frendes, and allyes of the Athenians, wherof many were reuolted and rebelled with the sayd ennemys. Wherfore the sayed Athenyans, dyd loke for no lesse, but that the sayd Peloponesians would come to assaille them euen in that same iourney both by sea, and by lande. And yet notwithstāding, they were not aduised to shewe themself fainte harted, nor to forsake their busynes, but rather to assemble and gather togiders the most shyps that they coulde out of al costes, and for to do it, to amasse and gather togiders monney by all meanes and also woode and stuff for to make ships, and moreouer to assuer their frendes and allyes, chieflye the Eubeyens, and moreouer to restreyne the expences and sumptuositie of their lyuynge in the cytye, and to treate a newe counsaille of the moste auncyentes, that shulde haue the auctorytie and charge to prouyde for the affaire of warre in all cases aboue all the other. And for effect they were attentife and diligent to make all necessary prouisions, as people beyng afrayde do generally make, and for to execute that which was deuysed and determyned. And in thies enterfeates the somer endedde. The wynter followinge in manner all the Grekes did begynne to make newe sorrowes for the great losse that the Athenyans had made in Sycille. For it semed vnto them that had bene newter in that same warre, that they shoulde not perseuer in that same newtralytie, but rarher take partie with the Peloponesiās, although that they were not therunto required, for that, that they iudged that the sayd Athenians would haue come against theym, if they had obteigned the victory in Sycille. And on the other parte it semed

vnto theyme for trouth that the reste of the warre shoulde be the sonner acheued and endedde, and also that it shoulde be greate honnoure vnto theym to be parttakers of the victory. And as touchynge those, that were declaredde to be wyth the Lacedemonyans, they offred theymself more readely than they hadde bifore tyme done, hopynge that the victorye shoulde brynge theyme oute of all necessities and oute of all dangers. And also those, whiche were subiectes of the Athenyans were the more determynedde for to rebelle and for to doo agayn

For all the

                  hiche thynges the cytie of Lacedemonie dyd conceyue greate hope to obteigne victorye agaynste the sayd Athenyans. And specially for that, that it was to bileue, that the Sycilians being their allyes, and hauynge so greate nomber of shipps, aswell of theirs as of those, whiche they hadde gottene fro the Athenyans, shulde come in the sprynge tyme vnto their ayde. And so hauyng hope on all sydes, they determyned not to make anny delay in the warre, makynge their accompte that if they had the victory at that same time, they shulde be alwayes in suertie & out of the danger, wherein they shoulde haue bene, if the Athenyans hadde gottone Sycille. For it is fully clere, that if they had subdewed it, they would haue made themself Lordes of all Grece. Followynge than this determynation, Agis king of the Lacedemonyans,Agis. departed that same wynter out of Decelea, and sailled by sea through the cyties of the allyes, for to cause them to contrybute monney for to make newe shyppes.

Whiche hostages he sente into Corynthe, and for effecte the Lacedemonyans ordeyned one houndred galleys to be made by theym and their allyes, and taxedde vnto euery one for hys rate a portion, to wytte, to theym, xxv, and to the Beotians asmanye, to the Phociens, Locriens, and Corynthyans, xxx, to the Arcadians, Peloponesians, Sycioniens, Megarens, Trezeniens, Epidauriens and Hermioniens, xx, and moreouer they made prouisio

               Howe the Lacedemonians were required and instanced by those of Chio of Lesbos, and of Hellesponte to sende vnto them an army by sea for to resist the Athenyans against whom they were wylling to rebell, & the order that therupon was geuen. ☞The .ii. Chapter.
               IN the meane tyme that thies thynges were done on the one syde and on the other, and that they were attentife and diligent in their prepation asmuche, as if the warre shulde begyn at the self houre, specially the Eubeens, bifore all the other allyes of the Athenyens, sent messengers vnto Agis for to iogine with the Lacedemonians, who receyued them gentlely, and comanded two pryncipall men of Lacedemonie to come vnto him for to sende theym into Eubee, that is to wytt, Alcamenes sone of Stenclaide, and Melanthus,Melanthus. who came with foore houndredde freemen. The Lesbyans also, whiche desired to rebell fro thē, sent likewise vnto Agis to demaūde men of hym for to sende into their towne, who at the perswatiō of the Beotians agrede vnto them & in the meane time suspended the enterprise of Eubee. And he sent Alcamenes, who shuld go thider, vnto Lesbos wt, xx, ships, wherof Agis furnished tenne and the Beotians tenne. And Agis did al this, without causinge the Lacedemonyans to knowe any thyng therof. For he had auctoritie to sende people to what place that he woulde, and to assemble and leuie lykewyse & for to recouer monney and employ yt so as he shulde thinke expediente, so longe as he shulde be at Decelea. During whiche time all the allyes dyd obey him, somewhat more than the cytie of Lacedemonie, for that, that hauing the army at his will, he caused it to go whider he would. And so he agrede with the Lesbyans, as it is abouesayd. On the other syde those of Chio, and those of Erithree, whiche were mynded likewise to rebell from the Athenians, made their treatie with the officers and counsaillours of the cytie of Lacedemonie withoute knowlaige of Agis, with whome was come into the sayd cytie, Thissaphernes,Thissaphernes that was prouoste of the inferiour prouynce for the kynge Dareus,Dareus sonne of Artaxarxes, who solycited the Peloponesians to make warrre against the Atheniens and promysed to fournishe thē with monney, wherof he had the comoditie, for that, that by the comandement of the king his maister, he had a lytle b

                  fore exacted a tribute of his prouynce to the intent for to employ the monney against the Athenyans. Whome he hated much, for that, yt those were they, that had empesched him to make Grece trybutairie vnto hym, and it semedde to the sayed Thissaphernes, that more easely he shulde recouer the sayd trybute insomuche as he was mynded to employe ytt against the Athenyans, and also by that meane that he shoulde make allyance bitwene the Lacedemonians and the kynge Dareus, & besydes this, that he shulde haue in his power, Amorges,Amorges. bastarde sonne, of Pyssuthnes. Who beyng prouost of the countrey of Carie for the kynge,Caria. was rebelled againste him, and he hadde comanded the sayd Thissaphernes that he shulde take paine to haue him lyuing or deade. And thereupon Thissaphernes agrede with theym of Chio. In the selfe season Calligetus,Caligetus. sonne of Leophon of Megare, & Tymagoras,Timagoras. sonne of Athenagoras of Cizine, who were both chased out of their countrey, came vnto Lacedemonie vnto Pharnabasus,Pharnabazus. sonne of Pharnacus, who had withdrawin thē thider, to demaūde of the Lacedemonyans ships, for to carye thē into Hellesponte, offring them to make all his power to get the cyties of his prouynce, which toke parte with the Atheniās, for thē, desiring by that meane to make the like alliance bitwene the kyng Dareus his maister and them. Thies practises of Pharnabazus

and of Thissaphernes being than brought to Lacedemonie, wythoute that those, whiche brought the one, hadde in any thynge knowlaige of the other: the Lacedemonyans were in greate controuersie, for some were of opynyon that mē shulde furst sende shyps into Ionium and Chio, and the other that they shulde sende into Hellesponte. But fynally the greater partie was of opynyon that men oughte furste to accepte the partie of Chio and of Thissaphernes, specially at the perswation of Alcibiades, who at that presente lodgedde in the house of Endius, that was the same yeare Ephore, that is to saye, Trybune of the comon people, and hys father also had lodgedde there, by reasone whereof, he was calledde, Endius Alcibiade.Endius But bifore that the Lacedemonyans sente their shyppes to Chio, they sente one, who was neyghboure of that same cytye named Phrynes,Phrynes. for to espie, if they hadde so greate nomber of shyppes, as they had geuen to vnderstande, and in the reste if their cytye were so ryche, and so puissante as it was renomedde, who beynge come agayne and hauynge made hys reapoorte that there was nothynge lesse in effecte than in renome, made incontinentlye allyance wyth the sayd Chiens, and Erythriens, and ordeyned to sende thider foorty galleys for to ioigne theyme wyth the other three skoore, whiche the Chiens sayde that they had, whereof they shulde sende at begynnynge foorty and tenne other afterwardes by Melacride their Capitaine by sea. In whose place they afterwardes dydde choose Chalcideus, forsomuche as in the makynge the election of the sayd Melacride, yt hadde thoundredde. And of tenne shyppes that Chalcideus shulde haue caryed, he hadde but onely fyue therof. And in thies enterfeaictes the wynter ended. Whiche was the ende of the .xx. yeare of the warre, that Thucydides hath wryttone. In the begynnynge of the furste sprynge, those of Chio sente incontinently vnto the Lacedemonyans that they shoulde sende them the shyppes, whiche they hadde promysed vnto theym. For they fearedde greately leaste the Athenyans shoulde be aduertisedde of their treatie, wherof they hadde yet vnderstandedde nothynge. For this cause the Lacedemonyans sente three of their cytezeins vnto the Corynthyans for to shewe theym, that they shoulde cause all the shyppes to passe, aswelle those, whiche Agis had caused to be armed for to sende into Lesbos, as the othere in the sea, where they were throughe the distreate in the sea of Athenes, and to conducte theyme to Chio whyche shyppes were to the nomber of, xlix. But forsomuche as Calligetus, and Tymagoras woulde not be partakers of that same voiage, the ambassadours of Pharnabazus woulde not delyuer the monney that he hadde sente for to wage the armye by sea, whyche amountedde to, xxv, talentes, but rather determynedde to make an othere armye wyth that same monney, and therewyth to goo thider, where they hadde purposed. Whan Agis vnderstoode that the Lacedemonians hadde determyned for to sende furste vnto Chio, he woulde not goo agaynste their deliberation. And lykewyse the allyes hauynge holden their counseille in Corynthe, were of that self opynyon, that Chalcideus shulde furst goo into Chio. Who had armed fyue shyppes at Lacanique. And afterwardes Alcamenes, whome Agis hadde also cho

                  ene for capytaine, shulde goo to Lesbos. And fynally that Clearchus sonne of Rhamphius shulde goo into Hellesponte. But bifore all thynges they ordeynedde that the moytie of their shyppes shulde passe with all diligence, the distreacte, afore that the Athenyans shulde parceyue yt, fearynge leaste they shulde charge aswell vpon them, as also vpon the othere that shulde passe afterwardes. For from the other sea, the shyps of the Peloponesians myght departe openly wythout any feare of the Athenyans, for that, that no man coulde yet see any army in the sea for them in anny poorte.
            
            
               
               Howe certene of the Peloponesians shyppes were repoulsed by the Athenyans in the porte of Pyerus. And howe the cyties of Chio, of Erythree, of Mylet and many other tourned vnto the cōfederation of the Pelopone

               ENsuyng that same deliberation, those, whiche hadde charge thereof, passedde the distreate with .xxi. galleys. And thoughe that they made great instance to the Corinthyans, that they shulde passe with them yet they woulde not do it, for that, that the feast, whiche is called Isthmie, dyd drawe nygh, the whiche they were wyllyng to celebrate bifore their departure. Which perceiuedde, Agis, that they shulde not breake the othe, by the whiche they had made trefues with the Athenians vntill after that same feaste, offred to take thē in his name, wherunto they also woulde not agree. And in the meane time that they debated hereupon, the Athenyans, being aduertised of the treatie that the Chiens did make, sent vnto them one of their officers, named Aristocrates,Aristocrates. for to declare vnto thē, that they dyd naughtely. And forsomuche as they denied the case, he cōmanded them, that they shulde sende their shyps to Athens, lyke as they were bounde by vertue of their allyance, whiche thynge they durst not refuse, and sent thider seuen galleys, wherof certene, whiche dydde not knowe the other treatie, were authors, and also they that knewe yt, who feared to putt theymself in danger and to declare the case vnto the comminaltie, vntyll they myghte haue some puissance, for to resiste yt, if that it woulde ryse vppe, not hopynge more that the Peloponesians woulde haue come, sithens that they taryed so longe. Durynge this tyme, the solempne playes were made at the feaste of Isthmie, wherat the Athenyans were, for that, that they had hadde suertie or saulf conducte to come thider. And so they lernedde there more clerely howe the Chiens practysedde to rebell frome them. For this cause, after that they were retourned vnto Athenes, they prepared their shyppes for to defende, that those of thennemyes shulde not departe out of Cenchree without their knowlaige.Cēchree. And ryght sone after the feast, they sent thider .xxi. galleys for to encounter the other xxi, wherof Alcamenes had the conduct. And after that they did see them, they enforced themself to tull them into the mayne sea, faigning themself to retyre. Neuerthelas after that the Peloponesians had followed them a lytle further, they retourned backe, whiche sene, the Athenyans dydde lykewyse retyre, forsomuche as they trusted not seuen shyps which they had from Chio in their compaignie of .xxi. But being afterwardes come vnto thē an other newe succours with .xxxvii other shyps, they followed the ennemyes vntill the deserte & habandoned porte, which is in the extremyties or furthest parte of the lande of Epidaurians, which they called Pyreus,Pyreus within the which porte the Peloponesians ships were retyred, reserued one, whiche was loste in the mayne sea. At which place the Athenyans came to assaille theym by sea, and also landedde one parte of their men, who fearedde theyme greatly, and crusshed manye of their shyppes and dyd slay manany men, among whome was Alcamenes, also a certene nomber of their people dyed bifore that they departed, but fynally the Athenyans retyredde. And for to kepe the ennemyes assiegedde, they lefte suche nomber, as they thoughte good in a lytle Islande there adioignynge, wherein they lodgeddde theymeselfe, and sente wyt h dilygence by a brigantyne to the Athenyans, that they shoulde

sende theyme newe succours: durynge this tyme and the daye followynge the Corinthians did comme to the ayde of the Peloponesians, and sone after, those of the other allyes: who seinge, that it shulde be veray harde for them for to kep

                   that same desarte place, were in greate perplexitie, and at the furste brunte did speake of burning their ships. But fynally they determyned to wythdraw them towards the lande, & to cause their men to lande for to warde them vntill that they shulde see oportunytie for to saue them. Agis beinge aduertysed of the whiche thynges, sente vnto them a cytezeine of Sparte, named Thermon.Thermon. Nowe the Lacedemonyans hadde bene aduertysed of the departure of the shipps out of the destreate, for that, that the Trybuns of the people had cōmanded Alcamenes that he shulde aduertyse them, immediatly whan he departed. For this cause they sence wyth all dylygence fyue ships after, vnder the conducte of Chalcideus and of Alcibiades. But afterwardes beinge aduertysed howe their men and shippes were fledde, they were all astonyed and da

                  shedde oute of countenance, that their furst enterpryse of warre in the sea Ionium, had myshappened, in suche sorte that they were determyned not to sende any more an army by sea out of their lande, and to reuoke or calle backe the same, whiche they had already sente thider. Whyche perceyued, Alcibiades perswaded eftsones to Endius, that he shulde not suftre the enterpryse of Chio to be brokene of, nother to waxe colde. For it mighte arryue there, before that the Chiens were aduertysed of the inconuenyence of the other shyppes. And if he himselfe saylled into Ionum, he was hable to cause ryght easely the cyties, whyche toke parte wyth the Athenyans to rebelle, sygnefyinge vnto them the debilitie and lowe estate of the Athenyans, and the puissance, togyders with the enterpryses of the Lacedemonyans: for somuche as he had greate creditt wt them. And besydes this, Alcibiades, shewed to Endius perticulerly, that it shulde be greate honnor and greate glorye vnto hym, that by hys meane the contrey of Ionum shulde rebelle from the Athenyans to the confederatyon wyth the Lacedemonyens: and that by that meane he shulde be compaignyon wyth Agys kinge, and so haue done yt wythoute the sayde Agis, vnto whom the same Endius was aduersary: and Alcibiades so perswaded Endius and the other Trybuns, that the charge of fyue shippes, wyth Chalcideus the Lacedemonyan, was delyuered vnto hym for to go in that same partie, whiche they did in a ryght small tyme. Nowe chaūced it in that self time that Gylippus after the victorie comynge agayne oute of Sycille into Grece wt xvi. Peloponesians shipps, he encountred nighe to Leucade .xxvii. shippes of the Athenyans: wherof Hippocles,Hippocles. sonne of Menippus, was chief, who was sente thider to thys ende, to wytt, for to encounter and spoylle the shippes, whych came oute of Sycille, and though that he did them greate displeasure and greatly feared them, yet neuerthelas they eskaped all, resarued one, and sailled to lande at Corinthe. In the meane tyme Chalcideus & Alcibiades in making their voiage, did take all the shippes, whyche they encountred, of whatsoeuer sorte that they were: to the intente that their passage shulde not be knowin: the whyche neuerthelas they dyd afterwardes suffer to departe, byfore they arryued at the place of Coricque,Coricus whyche is in mayne lande, and hauinge treated wyth certene of the Chiens that ministred to the treatie, they were aduertysed not to speke therof to any whatsoeuer parsone: whiche thinge they dyd in suche sorte, that they arriued at the Cytie of Chio, byfore that any parson knewe any thinge therof. The Cytezeins beyng much astonyed therof, they were perswaded by some for to assemble the counsaille of the towne, for to heare, what they, whyche were arryued, wold say. And the same beinge assembled Chalcideus and Alcibiades declaredde vnto

them, how many of the Peloponesians ships did come after vnto them, wtoute makyng mention of those, that were assieged in Pyreus. The Chiens vnderstanding whichch thinge, made allyance wyth the Lacedemonians, departing them self from the same of the Athenians: & the lyke they caused incontynently after to be made by the Erethriens,Erithrei and consequently by the Clazomeniens,Clazomenes who wout any further delay passed fourthwith into the mayne lande, and builded there a small towne, to the ende, that if any shulde come to ouerrōne them in the Island, they might haue some place for to witdraw thēself into. And for effecte all those that rebelled, were attentiue & diligente for to fortefie their walls, & to prouyde thēself wt all thinges for to resiste the Athenians, if they did come to assaill them. Whan ye Athenyās were aduertised of ye rebellyō of the Chiēs, they were in great sorow & doubt, that their allyes perceyuing that same great cytie rebelled, wold do the like. For this cause, albeit that they had layd a part a thousande talentes & had made a decree yt no man shuld speke or purpose vnder the great paynes to touche or to take therof during all ye warre: yet neuerthelas for the feare, yt they had of that same case, they reuoked their decre, & ordeyned that men shulde take a great part therof, wherwith that they might make and tacle a great nōber of ships: & moreouer caused eyghte of those that were in Pyreus to dislodge vnder the conduict of Strōbichides sone of Diotimus for to follow those,Strōbichides which Chalcideus and Alcibiades did conducte: but they coulde not ouertake them, for they were already come agayne fromthence. And sone after they sent for the same effecte twelue other ships vnder the conducte of Thra

                  ides, which likewise were departed frō the Siege of those, that were in Pireus. For vnderstanding the rebelliō of ye Chiens, they seased the .xvii. ships, which they had of thē at the said Pyreus: & restored to libertie the esklaues that were wtin them: but they did take ye cytezeins prisoners. And in stede of the other, which had geuē vp & forsaken that same siege, there were other fourth wt sent thider at great charges, & also they had determyned to arme .xxx. & vpwards of them: which to do they vsed so great dyligence, yt it semed that they estemed nothing to be sufficient inough for to recouer Chio. During this time Stronbichides wt .viii. ships sailled to Samū, & hauing there taken also one shippe, which he founde there, he sailled to Tea,Tea. and prayed the cytezeins that they wolde be firme and constant, & not to make any nouelty. Unto which place Chalcideus dyd come frō Chio with .xxiii ships, in the whiche he had charged a great nomber of fotemen, aswell of Erythree, as also of Clazomenie. Stronbichides, being aduertysed therof, he departed incontynently from Tea, & whan he had taken the mayne sea, seing afarre of so great nōber of ships he retired into Samie, where he saued himself, although that the other did geue him the chase. Which perceyued, the Theriens although that at beginning they had refused to receyue garnyson into their cytie, receyued it after Stronbichides was fledde fromthence. And there were lefte the fotemen Erithryens and Clazomeniens: who hauynge certen dayes attended the retourne of Chalcideus, that followed Stronbichides, and seynge that he came not, they dyd rase downe the walles of the towne, whiche the Athenyans had made frome of the coaste of the mayne lande. And that did they, wyth the ayde and perswation of certaine strangers that came thider in the meane time vnder conducte of Stages, lieutenāt of Cissaphernes. In this meane time Chalcideus & Alcibiades, hauing chased Strō

                  bychides into the porte of Samie, they retourned fromthence to Chio, & there left their maroners in garnisō, whō they armed as souldears. And hauing in their stede put into their ships men of ye countrey & moreouer armed .xx. other shipps, they sailled fromthence to Mylet, trusting to cause the towne to rebelle. For Alcibiades,

who had great amytie wt many of the pryncipall cytezeins therof, wolde gladly do that acte, byfore that the shyps of the Peloponesians shulde be sente thyder for that same cause, and to haue that same honnour, aswell for him as for Chalcydeus and also for those of Chio, whome they hadde in their compaignie, and moreouer for Endius, who was author of hys voiage: that by their meane, many Cyties, whyche toke parte wyth the Athenyans, shulde rebelle. Hauynge than made greate dyligence by sea the moste secretly that they myght, they arryued at the said Milet a lytle before Stronbichides and Thrasicleas,Thrasicleas. who were sente thider by the Athenyans wyth .xii. shippes, and caused the towne incontynently to tourne to their confederatie. Sone after arryued other nynetene ships of the Athenyans, whyche followed those here, the whyche not beinge receyued by the Mylesians, they retyred into an Islande there adioygning, named Lada.Lada. Sone after the rebellyon of Mylet, the furst alliance was made betwene the king Dareus & the Lacedemonyans by Tyssaphernes & Chalcideus in this manner.
               
                  The tenour of the allyaunce betwene the kinge Dareus and the Lacedemonians.
                  IN thies enterfaictes, the Lacedemonyens and their allyes, made allyaunce wyth the kynge Dareus and Tyssaphernes hys prouoste, in this manner. That the cyties, landes, countreys and seigniories, that the Athenyans helde, those same, whyche the kynge or hys predecessours had holdene, shulde remayne vnto hym: and that all the reuenue that those Athenyans dyd take therof, shulde be enioyed by the kynge and the Lacedemonyans togiders, and that they shulde defende that no parte thereof shulde cometo the proffitt of the Athenyans. That the kynge and the Lacedemonyans wyth their allyes shulde make warre commonlye agaynste the Athenyans: and that the one shulde not conclude peace wt them wythoute the othere. And that if any of the kynges subiectes rebelledde agaynste hym, the Lacedemonyans and their allyes shulde holde them for their ennemyes: and of the subiectes of the Lacedemonyans and allyes, if they rebelled, the kynge shulde take theym for hys. Such was the somme of the allyaunce bytwene them.
               
            
            
               Howe those of Chio or Chiens after that they were rebelledde agaynst the Athenyans, caused Mytilene and all the Isle of Lesbos to rebell. And howe the Athenyans dyd alterwardes recouer it wyth certen other cyties, whych were also rebelled. And howe, hauing vainquishedde the Chiens in three battailles they pillaged and wasted all their lande: and of some other thynges. ☞ The .iiii. Chapter.

But beinge aduertysed by Chalcideus howe Amorges did come agaynste their cytie wyth a great hoste by lande,Amorges. they retourned fromthence vnto the temple of Jupiter, oute of whyche place, they mighte see commynge .xvi. Athenyans shippes, whyche Diomedon conducted,Diomedon. who was sente from Athens

after Thrasicles. And knowing that they were shippes of Athenes, one parte of the Chiens wente vnto Ephesus and the other to Tea: of the whiche, foore were taken by the Athenyans. But that was, after that those, that were within them were landed. The other saued themself in the porte of Tea, and the Athenyās departed fromthence against Samū. And yet neuerthelas, the Chiens hauing assembled the other ships that were eskaped, and also a certen nomber of fotemen, they perswaded the cytie of Lebedus to forsake the partie of the Athenyans,Lebedus. and afterwards that same of Eras.Eras. And that done they retired wt their ships & fotemē into their houses. Abouts the same tyme the .xvi. ships of the Peloponesians, the whiche did holde a like nōber of the Athenyans shipps assieged at Pireus, issued soubdainly & vnloked for, vpon those Athenyans: and defyed & repoulsed them in such sort, that they did take foure of them: and that done, they sailled to the port of Cenchree, where they repaired and tacled their ships, for to saille afterwardes to Chio and into
Jonū vnder the conducte of Astyochus, whom the Lacedemonyans sente vnto them, vnto whom they had geuene charge of all the armye by sea. After that the fotemen that were at Tea, were departed fromthence, Tyssaphernes arryued there. Who hauing caused the reste of the walles to be beatene downe, sailled frōthence incontynently. And sone after Diomedon arryued there, with .xx. Athenyans ships, who did somuch with them of the towne, that they were cōtent to receue him, but he taried not there, & so sailled to Eras, thinking to take it by force: which thing he coulde not do, and for that cause departed. In that same tyme, the meane people of Samiū did rebelle against the greater, hauing wt them the ayde of the Athenyans, which were come to arriue there wyth thre ships. And they did slay two houndred of the principall of the same greater occupiers and they bannished other two houndred: and forfeyted their goodes, aswel of the dead, as of the bannished: the whiche they departed amongest them. And by consente of the Athenyans, after that they had promysed them to perseuer in their amytie they sett themself into lybertie, & gouerned themself of thēself, without geuing to the bannished, whose goods they did wythhold, any thing for their lyuinge, but rather made a great defence and prohibition, that none shulde take any land or house of them, nor also deliuer thē any. In thies enterfaicts the Chiens, that had determyned to declare themself against the Athenyans, in all sortes yt they coulde cessed not wt their proper force, wtout any ayde of the Peloponesians, for to sollycit & practise the other cyties, holding the partie of ye Atheniās for to tourne frō them, & they did this for many reasons, but principally for to wtdraw so many more people into self danger, wherin they were. And so they armed .xiii. ships, with the which they sailled towards Lesbos, ensuyng the derre of the Lacedemonyans: by ye which it was appoincted yt the second nauigatiō or voiage by sea shuld be made to ye said Lesbos, & the thirde to Hellespōte.

On ye other side Astiochus ye admiral by sea of the Lacedemoniās, departed frō Cenchre wt thre ships & did come to Chio. Being at which place, thre
dates after his cōminge, he vnderstode how Leōtes & Diomedō were arriued at Lesbos wt .xxv. Athenians ships. which vnderstāding, he departed ye same day in the euening with one only ship of Chio, for to saille into ye parte, & to see if that he could geue any newe succours to the Mytileniens, and did come that night to Pyrrha, and the morowe aftere, to

Eresse. In which place he was aduertised, how the Athenyās had at the furst assaulte, taken the cytie of Mytilene by thys manner. For bifore that any man perceyued yt, they were soubdaynly arryued in the porte, where they destroyed the shipps of the Chiens, which they found there, and fourthwith were landed, & hauynge repoulsed those of the towne, that came to the defence, they were entred into it by force. Astyochus than vnderstandinge this nouueltie, he changed hys opynyon to go to Mytilene. But rather wt the shipps of the Eressiens & three of those of Chio, which the Athenyans had takene at Methymna wyith Eubolus their capytain (but after the takyng of Mytilene, were eskaped, and the fyfth remayned) he wente to Eressus, and after that he had put good garnysone wyth in it, he sente by lande to Antissa and to Methymna the men of warre, that he had within his ships vnder the conducte of Eteonicus,Eteonicus. and he wt his shippes and three of the Chiens, sailled by sea that self way, hopynge that the Mytilenians, seing his army by sea, wold take courage for to persiste and contynue in their rebellion agaynste the Athenyans. But seyng that all thynges came contrary vnto hym in the Isle of Lesbos, he recharged hys men, whyche he had sette on lande and retourned fromthence to Chio, and there parted or disseuered the men that he had, aswell of sea, as of lande, through the townes and villaiges vntill that, wherby they shulde passe into Hellesponte.Hellespontus. And sone after came thider sixe ships of the allyes of the Peloponesians, to wyt of those, that were in Chencte. On the other syde the Athenyans, hauinge than ordayned the affayres of Lesbos, they did come to the newe towne, whyche the Clazomenyans had newly made in the mayne lande,Clazomenei, and did beate and rase it vtterly downe: and the cytezeins, whiche they founde wythin it, they caryed agayn into the cytie within the Islande, those excepted, which had bene authors of the rebellyon, who were fledde fromthence to Daphnus, & by that meane brought Clazomenie agayne into the obeissance of the Athenyans. The same sommer, the twenty Athenyans shipps that were rested at the Isle of Lada, nyghe vnto Mylett, hauynge sett their men on lande, did comme to assaille the towne of Panorme, whyche is in the terrytorie of the Mylesiens. At whyche assaulte Chalcideus duke of the Athenyans was slayne. who was come wyth a small nomber of men, for to succour the towne: and that done they departed fromthence, and the thirde daye after they dyd sett vp theire Trophee, whyche the Milesiens dyd afterwardes beate downe, saying that they ought not to haue reysed vp an Trophee in a place, whyche they hadde not taken by force. On the other syde Leon and Dyomedon with the shipps that they had at Lesbos departed fromthence, and came to the I

And also they had thys pollecie that howe muche the more the cytie encreased in ryches, somuche

they enforced themself to make yt the more fayer and triumphant in all things. And they neuer enterprysed to rebelle agaynste the Athenyans, vntil they parceyued that there were many of the other puissaunte and honnorable cyties, whiche did put themself into the self danger. And that the case of the Athenyans was in such declination after the losse, that they had made in Sycille, that they themself helde their estate in manner for lost. And though that they had an euyll opynyon therein, lyke as it happeneth in humayne affayres: yet neuerthelas it was comon with many other sage and puissante parsones: who helde it for certayne that the estate and the Empire of the Athenyans, wythin shorte tyme shulde be loste. Seinge than that they were oppressed, aswell by sea as by land, there were some in the towne that intreated to rendre it agayn to the Athenians. The principalleste of the towne beinge aduertysed therof, wolde make none other shewe or apparance therin of themself, but sent vnto Astyochus, who was at Erythree, that he shulde come wyth foure ships that he had, for to geue some remedy therin, takynge hostaiges or pledges of the suspected: or by suche other meane, as he shulde thynke to be expedyent: the moste modestuously that he coulde. In suche termes or condition were the affayres of Chio.

                     cus For to learne more easly, what was done at the said Mylet: & afterwards they arryued at Tichiusa,Tichiusa. which is the terrytorie of Mylet. Being in whiche place, they were aduertised of the battaill that had bene bifore the said Mylet, by Alcibiades, who was therat on the partie of the Mylesiens and of Tyssaphernes. That same man shewed them that if they were not willing to suffre Ionum, and afterwards all the rest to be loste: it was nedeful yt they shuld come to succour the cytie of Mylet soubdainly bifore that it might be enclosed wt walls, which shulde be no small matter if they permitted the enemys to do it: vpon thies wordes and declarations it was determyned and concluded on the morowe for to depart in the morning for to succour the said cytie. But Phrinicus,Phrynicus. being aduertysed of the cōming of that same army into that quarter although that his cōpaignions and collegues wylled that men shulde tary for to fayght: said that he would neuer consente vnto it, nor

                  rt a thing, whan there was no necessitie: and therfore that it was no shame to the Athenians for to retyre wyth their army for a certen time: but rather yt shulde be muche greater shame for theym, if it happened that they were vainquished, in what soeuer sort, that it shulde happene. And besydes the shame, the cytie of Athenes and hys estate shulde be brought into greate daunger: the whyche, consydered the greate losses that shee hadde wythin shorte tyme byfore made, oughte not to be putt in hazarte of battaylle, although that yt happelye hadde her preparatyon assured and sufficyente in all thynges, and that therein were no necessytie or lacke. Wherefore the thynges beynge in woorser termes and condytyon, there was no apparence to do yt wyllyngly, where that yt was not nedefulle. Therfore hys opynyon was, that they shulde fourthwith charge into theire shyppes all their men togyders wyth theire munytions, bagguages and vesselles, whyche they had broughte onelye thider, and to leaue the othere which they had gottone frō the enemys, for that they wold not ouercharge their ships, and wt the same to retire wyth the greatest diligence that they could vnto

Samye: and hauyng there assembled theyr ships agayne to saylle fromethence to serche their ennemyes, where they shulde thynke that they might do yt wyth their aduantage: the whiche opynyon the other dyd followe. And aswel for that, as in many other thinges, that were commytted to Phrynicus, he was always reputed to be a saige man and of a clere vnderstandinge. In thys manner the Athenyans wythout fynishinge their enterpryse departed frome Mylet about the euenynge tyde. And they being arryued at Tam

But being there arryued, and vnderstanding the departure of the ennemys, after that they had soiourned there one daye, they dyd take the ships of the Chi

And they beinge there arryued, Tissaphernes did come to mete them wt his fotemen, and perswaded them to saille vnto Lasus, where Amorges bastard sōne of Pissunthes, who was enemy and rebell to the kinge Dareus, kepte himself. Where unto the Peloponesians did agre and came to the sayde place wyth so greate dyligence, that the sayd Amorges parceyued it not: but rather whan he did see thē come straight into the porte, he thought that they had bene ships of Athens. And by that meane, they did take the porte, though that those of ye towne, whan they dyd knowe that they were ennemys, made great defence: but they could not resiste the puissance of the enemys, and chiefly af the Syracusains, who did beste y• same day. In that same towne Amorges was taken prysoner by the Peloponesians, who sente hym agayne to Tyssaphernes for to cōuey him to the kinge his maister, if he thought good. But the pyllaige of the towne was graunted to the souldyars, who foūde it all full wyth goodes, and specially wt mōney, forsomuch as that same towne had longe bene in peace and in prosperytie. As touchinge the souldears, whyche the same Amorges had, the Peloponesians receyued them in to their soulde or wages, and deuyded them amonge their compaignies, for yt, that there were many of the countrey of Peloponesa. But the rest of the people, which were founde in the towne, the Lacedemonyans cōmitted theym togiders wt the towne vnto Tyssapharnes paying for euery of the sayd prysoners one stater of Darea: and wyth the same they retourned to Mylet. And fromthence sente Pedaretus, sonne of Leon, whō the Lacedemonians had sente to Chio, for to be gouernour of the towne, wt the souldiars yt they had had of Amorges.

                  ly refused to delyuer the shippes of the Chiens, he toke wyth hym fyue Corinthyans shipps and one of Megare besides hys owne, whiche he had brought out of Laconie and retourned to Mylet, where his principall charge was: and sayd in anger vnto the Chiēs, that they shuld not loke to haue any aide from him, whatsoeuer busynes that they mighte haue. So he sailled to lande at Coryce,Coricus where he soiourned certen dayes. During this tyme the army of the Athenyans, departed from Samie & arryued at Chio, and they came to lodge themself at the fote of a hill that was betwene the porte and them, so that they, whiche were within the said porte, perceyued them not: nother also the Athenyans did knowe what the other did. Bitwene both, Astiochus was aduertised by letters frō Pedaritus, how some Erithriens, which had bene prisoners at Samie, were released by the Athenyans, and sent to Erythree to cause the cytie to rebelle. So he incontynentlye launched fourth to returne thider, and it failled very litle, but that he had fallen into ye Athenyans handes: neuerthelas he came thider in saulftie, where he foūde Pedaritus, who was lykewyse come thider for the self cause.

In the selfsame tyme Astyochus beinge come to Mylet, he founde his armye ryght well appoincted with all thinges, for that, that the Peloponesyans fournished ryght well to the payemente of souldyars, who besides that same, had greate and muche monney for the butie, whych they had gotton at Lasus. And on the other parte, the Mylesians were all desposed to doo that, whiche was possible for them for their partie. But forsomuche, as the laste allyance, whiche Chalcideus had made wyth Tyssaphernes, semed not to be ample inough, but defectuous and faulty in some things, which made more for the partie of Tyssaphernes, than for them they refourmed and renewed yt an other tyme by the meane of Theramenes, in the manner, to followeth.
               
                  The seconde treatie of allyance bitwene the Lacedemonyans and the kinge Dareus.
                  HEre followe the articles, conuenaūtes and treaties of amytie, bitwene the Lacedemonians and their allyes of the one paatie, and the kynge Dareus, his children and Tyssaphernes on the other partie. Furst that all the cyties, contreys, landes and seigniories, whiche do at this present apperteigne to kyng Dareus, & that haue bene hys fathers or other his predecessours, shall remayne franke and free vnto him in manner, that the Lacedemonyans nor their allyes may not go thider for to warre or to do damage therin, and that they may not exacte nor take any trybute there. And lykewyse that the kynge, nor any of those, whiche be vnder him, may do damage nor exacte any trybute in the landes of the Lacedemonians nother of their allyes. And moreouer that if any of the said parties requireth any thinge of the other, & if that yt be graūted vnto him, in like case that same partie that shall haue receyued the plaisir, shalbe boūde to render it to the other, whā he shalbe therunto required. And that the warre, whiche they haue begonne agaynste the Athenyans, shalbe followed to the ende, generally by the sayde parties, and shall not be lefte of by the one wythout the othere. That all the men of warre, whyche shalbe leuied in the kynges countreys by his ordenance shalbe payde wyth hys monney. And if any of the confederated cyties shall come to inuade any of the kynges prouinces, the other shall forbydde and kepe them from it to his power. And to the contrary yf any of the kynges countreis or subiectes come to inuade any of the confederated cyties or their lande, the same kyuge shal empesche and forbydde them with his power. After this treatie made, Theramenes, hauing delyuered his ships to Astiochus, departed thence, & was neuer after sene. During this time the Athenians, that were cōme frō Lesbos against Chio, hauing assieged it by lande and by sea, did geue thēself to enclose the porte of Delphinie, which was a strong place on ye lande side, wt walle: and also it had a porte sufficiently suer, & was not veray farre from Chio, wherby the cytezeins were greatly troubled, aswell for many greate losses & damages, whiche they had already susteigned, by occasyon of the warre, as also for that, that the inhabytantes were yll agreinge amongest themself, and muche troubled otherwaies. For Pedaritus had caused already Tideus the Ionian wt all his men to dye, for that, that he suspected them to haue confederation wt the Athenyans. By reason of which acte, the reste of the cytezens, whych were brought to a small nomber, did not truste the one the othere, and therby it semed vnto them thot nother they, nother nother the strangers beinge souldyars, whiche Pedaritus had brought, were sufficient for to go fourth against the enemys. So they sente to Astyochus to Mylet to praye hym that he woulde comme to succour them. And for that, that he woolde not do it, Pedaritus did wryte to the

Lacedemonyans against him, that he did greatly endōmage the comen welthe. In this maner the Athenyans did holde the cytie of Chio assieged, and moreouer their ships, whiche they had at Samie came to presence battaille to those of the ennemyes that were at Mylet: but seing that they would not yssue fourth of their poarte, they retourned fromthence.

Duringe this tyme the Chiens and Pedaritus cessed not to instante Astiochus, that he shoulde come to succour them, seing them so assieged, & that he wold not so habandon the principall cytie of Ionū, which was enclosed on the coaste of the sea, & pillaged on the lande syde, and somuch the more fyercely

For all the which reasons, ye Chiens declared to Astiochus that he oughte to come to succour them, whilest that it was in hys power to empesche that they shulde not fynishe the closure of Delphinum, whiche was

not yet fully made. For after that it were acheued, the shypps and the armye of the ennemys shulde haue more spacious lodgyng there, than they had had. The whiche requestes & declarations perceyued, Astyochus

And afterwardes that they were ioigned with the other, xxvii, that were at Caunus, they sailled all togiders to Syma, where they reysed vp a Trophee, & afterwardes retourned from

to Samie, but in their waye they pyllaiged the towne of Loryme,Lorymus. whiche is in the mayne lande. The Peloponesians, hauinge assembled at Cnidus all their armye, they caused all that was nedefull to be repaired. And durynge this the, xii, counsaillours wyth Tyssaphernes, who was come to mete with them there, deuysed of thynges passed, whider there had bene any thynge therin done, that they iudged not good, and also of the manner of contynuynge the warre to the greatest aduantage that myght be for the welthe and proffytt, aswelle of the Peloponesians, as of the kynge. And amonge the other Lychas alleaged that the articles of the allyance, had not bene veray reasonably made, for he sayd, that reason would not that all the landes, whiche the kynge or his predecessours hadde gouerned
                     •
                   shoulde retourne into hys puissance, forsomuche as by that meane of necessitie al the Islandes, the Locrians, and the countreys of Thessale, and of Beotie shulde come agayne into his subiection, & the Lacedemonians by that meane, in stede of settynge the other Grekes into lybertie, shoulde bryng them into the bondage of the Medes. Wherfore he sayde and concluded that aither newe articles shulde be made, orelles that same allyance be lefte of and dissolued, and that for to obteigne the same, yt was not nedefulle that Tyssaphernes shoulde paye annye more soulde or wages. Who, hearynge thys preposition was ryghte angry and fulle of despyte, and so departed in greate angre and coller frome the sayd Peloponesians. Whyche, after hys departure beynge calledde by certene of the pryncipalles of the Rhodiens, they sailled into that same quarter, hopynge wyth the same cytie to gett a greate nomber of warryours and of shyppes, and that through the ayde of them, and of their allyes, they might haue monney sufficiente for to enterteigne their armye. Being than, the same wynter, departedde frome Cnidus with foore skoore and fortene shypps, they dyd come to aboorde at Camirus,Camirus. whiche is in the Islande of Rhodes. Whereof those of the countrey, and of the cytie, that knewe nothynge of the treatie, were muche afrayde, so that many of them habandoned the cytie, for this chiefly, that it was not closed wyth walles. But the Lacedemonyens sente vnto them, and caused them all to assemble togider, and lykewyse those of Lyndus,Lindus and of Ielissus,Ielissus and perswaded them that they shulde departe from the allyance and amytie of the Athenyans, and by that meane the cyties of Rhodes reuolted and dyd take parte wyth the Peloponesians. Nowe the Athenyans, that were at Samie, had bene bifore aduertised of this armye that was in the waye for to saille vnto Rhodes, and so they departed altogider hopyng to cosarue and succoure it, bifore that it shulde haue tourned frome theym, but beynge come vntyll wythin the sight of the ennemyes, and knowynge that they came to late, they retyred into Chalces,Chalces and fromthence to Samie. And yet notwithstandyng after that the Peloponeseans were departed frome the Rhodes, those same Athenyans came to make manye assaultes agaynste the Rhodiens, aswelle oute of Samie, as of Chalces and Coo.

               Howe Alcibiades beinge come into suspition of the Lacedemonyans, dyd repaire to Tyssaphernes, and perswaded hym to forsake the partie of the Peloponesyans, and to really or confederate hymself with the Athenyans. And howe ambassadours were sente by the sayd Athenyans vnto Thissaphernes for to conclude yt. ☞The .viii. Chapter.
               DUryng this tyme, and bifore the rebellion of Rhodes, after the death of Chalcideus, and the battaille, that was made at Milet: the Lacedemonyans had Alcibades in greate suspition, so that they did wryte to Astyochus, to cause hym to dye, for he was ennemye of Agis their kynge, and in the reste he was reputed a man of lytle fayth. But he beyng aduertised herof, had withdrawin hymself, euen at begynnynge as he had knowlaige of yt, towardes Tissaphernes, with whome, he had practised, all that he coulde agaynste the Peloponesians, and had declared vnto hym all that he had lerned of their affaire, and also he was the cause to make hym to abate and dymynyshe the soulde or wages that he payde vnto the souldiars, and in stede of a groate of Athenes, whiche he shulde haue payde them for the daye: to delyuer theym three half pence onely, whereof he also dyd oftentymes faille the paymente, and by information of the sayd Alcibiades, he excused himself, saying that the Athenians, whiche had better vnderstandyng in the feate by sea than they, dydde paye vnto their maronners, but the sayd wages: and that he would not bryng them therunto, aswell for to space the monney: (not for annye lacke that he had therof) as also not to geue them occassion, to abuse ytt, and to become more lascyuious and delycate, somuche the more, that the surplusage of that whiche shulde be necessarye for them to lyue wythin their vesselles, shulde not by theym be expended in superfluous thynges, whereby they shulde be the more weakened. And where that he deteigned from thē for a certene tyme, one parte of the payment, yt was to the ende that they shulde haue no occasion to departe & habandone the shyps, if nothynge were due vnto them, whyche thynge they durste not do, whan they shulde perceyue themself contregaiged with any parte of their soulde. And for to be hable to obteigne and perswade this same vnto the Peloponesians, the same Tissaphernes, by the counsaille of the said Alcibiades, had gotton all the patrons of the shyppes and all the capytaines of the townes for monney, resarued, that same Hermocrates of the Syracusayns, who onely dyd resiste agaynste yt with all hys power, in the name of all their confederates. And moreouer the selfe Alcibiades, speakynge for Tyssaphernes, dyd with reasone confute the cyties whiche demanded monney of the other confederates, for to kepe and defende them. And furst he said to the Chiens, that they ought to haue shame for to demande monney, considered that they were the richest of Grece, & also that they were sett into lybertie and exempted from the subiection of the Athenyans, throughe the ayde of the Peloponesians, wherfore there was no apparance to demande that the other cyties shulde brynge into danger their parsones and also their goodes and monney for to consarue the lybertie of that same cytie. And as touchynge the other cyties, that were also lykewyse rebelled agaynste the sayed Athenyans, that they dyd greate wronge not to be wyllyng to paye for the defence of their lybertie, that, which they had accustomed to pay to the Athenyans by ta
                     •
                  e or by subsedie. And moreouer he sayde that to the surplusaige, Tyssaphernes had reasone

to spare the monney in that manner for to susteigne the charges of the warre, at the least vntill he shulde haue newes frō the kynge, whider that he intended that the soulde shuld be entierly payde or not, and than if he comanded him to pay the whole, there shulde be no lacke therin, & also shulde recompense the cyties particulerly euery one accordinge to his deserte. And moreouer the sayed Alcibiades counsailled Tyssaphernes, that he shulde not go aboute to make by any meanes an ende of that same warre, & also that he shulde not cause the ships that he had caused to be tacled in Phenice to come, nother those which he had caused to be armed in Grece to ioigne with the same of the Peloponesians, for in that doyng he shulde make them lordes both of the sea, & of the lande. But rather that he shuld maignteigne them alwayes in strife & in warre, forsomuche as by that meane he shulde be alwayes in his puissance to prouoke the one of the parties againste the other, which shuld haue offēded him. But if he suffred that the one of the parties were destroyed, & that the other might haue the dominion in sea and in lande: he shulde fynde none, that might ayde him againste those same, if he would chastise them, and it shulde be forced yt he himself in that case shulde onely take the aduē
                  ture with greate danger & greate expences. Wherfore it was better, with smal expence to enterteigne them in controuersie, & by that meane to haue hys estate in full suertie. And also he shewed further to the sayed Tyssaphernes that the allyance of the Athenians shulde be muche more comely for the king, than the same of the Lacedemoniens, for that, that the same Athenians went not about to rule on lande. And their intent and facyon of making warre, was muche more proffytable for the kyng, than the same of the other, for this, yt the Grekes, whiche they shulde subdue in the sea, beynge his allyes, shulde redute and bringe them partly into their seruitude, and those that were in the lāde, inhabyting in the prouynces of the king, shulde remaine his subiectes, where the Lacedemoniens proceded directly to a contrary ende, to wytt, to restore all the Grekes into lybertie, wherefore it was to beleue that those, whiche went about, to bring the Grekes oute of seruitude of the self Grekes, that they would not suffre that they shulde remayne in the lyke bondage of barbarous or estrangers, & so would go about to sette in lybertie all those, that bifore tyme were not restored therunto, which thā were in the subiection of the kinge. Wherfore he counsailled him yt he shulde suffre the one partie to weaken & destroy the other. For after that the Athenians shal haue lost the greatest parte of their force, the Peloponesians shuld be so weakened, that he shulde easely chase them out of Grece. Tyssaphernes did easely agree to thies instructions, and knewe suffyciently that Alcibiades had tolde him the trouth, forsomuche as he might cōprehende & perceiue it by the affaires that occured. And insuing his counsaille, he furst payde the soulde to the Peloponesians. But for al that he would not suffre theym to make warre, but rather, he sometyme shewed them that they must attende the ships of the Pheneciās that shulde come, sometyme that they were to hoate & to ayger to fight. And by that meane he troubled all the enterpryse, and made the same armye, that was so fayer and puissante, in manner as vnproffitable. And also in other thynges he declared moste openly wyth woordes, sayinge that he vnwyllyngly made warre in compa
                     •
                  gnie of the sayed allyes, wholy by instruction of the sayed Alcibiades, who iudgynge the same to be a good thing, did perswade it aswel to the king as to Tyssaphernes, whan that he was wyth them. And that dyd he pryncipally for the desyre that he had to retourne into hys countrey, whiche thyng he hoped at some tyme to obteigne, if yt were not vtterly destroyed. And somuche the more, whan men shulde vnderstande that he had greate amytie with Tyssaphernes, lyke as it happened.

For as the souldyars Athenyans, that were at Samie, vnderstode the famyliaritie that he had with the said Tissaphernes with this
                     •
                   that he had alread

Who assured them furste to make Tyssaphernes their frende

But Phrynicus, who was yet Duke of the Athenyans, founde nothynge good, whiche came to that purpose. And it semedde to hym, that Alcibiades in the estate, wherin he was, desired not more the gouernance of the pryncipalles, than of the comon estate, but rather that his ende and intente, was to make some sedition in the cytie, hoping that by one of the parties, he shulde be called againe, and wholy restored, where agaynst the sayd Phrynicus mynded well to withstande, aswelle for his particuler interest, as for to exchue the deuysion of the cytie.

And those, whyche had not done yt, woulde not therfore lette to do yt. For where they hoped to recouer there lybertie by the meane of the Peloponesians, hauynge the victory: they would not choose to remayne in subiection of the Athenyans, in whatsoeuer manner that their estate shulde be gouerned, were it by the comons or by the pryncipalles.

Phrynicus sayd that he was well infourmed of all thies thynges, and therby not to fynde any thynge of that good, whiche Alcibiades dyd than sett forwarde. Yet alwayes those, whiche frome the begynnynge had bene of the contrarye opynyon, all that same notwithstanding, perseuered styll therin, & so ordeyned to sende messengers vnto Athens, amōgest whome was Pysander for to propone and declare vnto the cōmons,Pisāder the restitution and restoryng of Alcibiades, & the abolysshynge of the comon estate.

Which is, that he secretly sent one of his men to Astyochus, chief of the army by sea, of the Peloponesians, which was yet at Milet, whome he aduertised by his letters of manye thinges, and amonge o

Astyochus, hauing receyued his letters, dydde not greatly esteme them. For yt was not in his puissance to punyshe Alcibiades, for that, that he did no more come to him. But he went to Tissaphernes and the sayd Alcibiades, which were in the cytie of Magnesia,Magnesia. and seignifyed vnto them what was wryttone to hym oute of Samie, makynge hymself wytnes of that, whiche had bene addressed vnto hym, by that meane for to gratefie Tyssaphernes: and as men dyd iudge to make his particuler proffytt thereby, and also that, vnto that ende, he suffred that the paymente of the souldyars was delayed by the sayd Tyssaphernes. Alcibiades, hauinge recouered the letters of Phrynicus, sent them incontinently to the officers & chiefest that were in Samie, admonysshing and requirynge theym, that they shulde putt Phrynicus to death. Who, beynge herof aduertised, and perceyuyng hymself in greate danger, he did wryte eftsones to Asteochus, complayning of this, that he had discoueredde and delyuered hys letters to hys ennemyes, offryng vnto hym an other partie, to wytt, to brynge into hys power all the army, that he had at Samie, for to cause theym all to dye.

Which thing they did willingly aswell for to exchue the danger yt was presēt, as also for to be hable to warde & consarue it in time to come. Sone after, the letters of Alcibiades did come to the other capitains of the army, by the which he aduertised thē of the treat

But the said capitaines & other that vnderstoode it would not credytt it, but rather iudged yt he did write it but for hatred & that he charged Phrynicus to haue intelligence & confederatiō wyth thennemys of that thing, which the same Alcibiades knew wel yt they would do, and by that meane the letters of Alcibiades did in nothing hurt the sayd Phrynicus, but rather they did Auerre & credit that, which he had alredy discouered of thenterprise of ye sayd enemys. After yt, Alcibiades cessed not to perswade Tissaphernes, yt he shulde conclude amitie wt the Athenians, wherunto he redely enclined, for that, yt he alredye was in feare of the Lacedimoniās, seing that they were more puissant by sea, thā the Athenians. And neuerthels Alcibiades wēt about to get auctoritie towardes Tissaphernes, in manner that he shuld geue faith vnto him. And chiefly after that he had vnderstāde the difference, yt had bene bitwene Tissaphernes & the comissaries Lacedemoniās at Cnidus,Cnidus touching the articles of allyāce made by Theramenes, which differēce had already bene moued bifore yt the said Peloponesians came to the Rhodes. And also bifore that same, Alcibiades had vttred ye purpose, wherof we haue spokē, to Tissaphernes, shewing vnto hym that the Lacedemonians went about to restore & set al the grekishe cyties in lybertie, wherby, being afterwardes chāced the proposition yt Lychas had at the assēble of Cnidus, who sayd that ye same article was not to be holden, by the which it was spokene yt the king shuld recouer to his obeissāce al ye cyties, which he or his predecessours had gouerned: he fortefied his opiniō more & more. And by such meanes, Alcibiades, as a mā that intended great thinges, wēt about to shewe himself in all sortes, affectioned to ye said Tissaphernes. During this time, ye messengers which were sēt with Pysāder by the Athenians yt were at Samie, to ye citie of Athēs, being there arriued proponed & declared to ye comons yt which they had in charge, touching sō marely the principal poinctes, & chiefly that in doinge this, whiche was demaū

Against the which thinges many of y• peple did speake wt great instāce, aswel for the affecciō which they had to ye comon estate, as also for thenmytye yt they had against Alcibiades. And they said that it shuld be a thing tomuch to their reproch for to restore to auctorite him, who had violated & broken their lawes, & against whom, those yt pronoūced the hallowed

Wherupon Pysander, seynge the greate multitude of the Againesayers, he went thider, where the greatest preasse of them was, and takyng theym by the hande the one after the other, he demaunded of theym if they had any hope of victorye agaynste the Peloponesians by other meane, seynge that they had so greate an armye by sea, as theirs, and greate nomber of cyties of Grece in their allyance, and moreouer the kynge and Tyssaphernes, who fournysshed them wyth monney, wherof the Athenians had no more, nother coulde hope to haue, but on the kynges bihaulf. Wherunto al those, whome he demaunded, aunswered him that they perceyued none othere meane. Than he replyed vnto theym that the same coulde not be done, if they refourmed not the gouernance of the cytye, & dyd not cōmytt it into the hande of a smalle nomber, and that the kynge desyred it for to be more suer of the cytie. Wherefore he required theym that they shoulde not be wyllyng to haue more regarde to the gouernaunce of the tytie, than to to welth of the same. For afterwardes, wyth the tyme, it shoulde be in their facultie and power for to change yt, if they thought good. Lett vs than call agayne, sayed he, at thys presente Alcibiades, who alone hath power to do yt. Through thies declarations and perswations of Pysander, the people, whiche at the begynnynge dyd take this change of the estate and gouernance to be strange, vnderstandyng by the proposition of the same Pysander, that there was no other meane to saue the Empire and the cytie, partly in feare and partly in hope, they were contente that the gouernance shulde be commytted into the hande of a smalle nomber of men. And the decree was made, wherby the people dyd geue charge and comission to Pysander, wyth tenne other cytizeins for to go to Tyssaphernes and Alcibiades, for to create and accorde wyth them, touchyng the same, in suche sorte as shulde seme vnto them moste proffitable for the cytie. And by the self decree, Phrynicus wyth hys compaignion Sciron,Sciron who had been accused by the sayed Pysander, was deposed frome their charge, and in their stede were placed Diomedon and Leon,

And the charge, whiche Pysander had layed agaynst Phrynicus, was that he suffred Amorges to be betrayed and lost and it semed to hym that he was not sufficient for to conducte the thynges, that shoulde be treated wyth Alcibiades. Pysander hauynge than sett fourth all the coniurations and fourme of doynges, whiche were in the begynnynge, bifore that the common estate had auctorytie, aswelle touchynge the iudgementes as also the officers, and done somuche that the people being assembled, had consented to the abolysshyng & abrogating of the comons estate, and moreouer prouyded for all thynges that semed to hym necessarye for the state of the thynges presente: he launched fourth into the sea wyth hys tenne compaignions and sailled fromthence to Tyssaphernes.

Which thing vnderstanding, It was determyned by an generall accorde of thē all for to succour it.

Who perceiuing that, did put fourth such parties bitwene the Athenyans & Tyssaphernes, yt they coulde not agree, whiche thing, in my fantasie, the said Tyssaphernes also purposed, but to dyuers endes & for diuers causes. To witt, Tissaphernes, for that yt he feared the Peloponesiās, & therfore durst not wel departe frō them. And Alcibiades for this, that seing y• Tissaphernes was not willing to conclude the appoynctment, he would not geue knolaige therof to the Athenians yt it was not in his puissance to cause hym to cōdescēde vnto it, but rather was he wylling to cause theym to bileue, that he had already wonne hym, and that they were the cause of the breaking of, for that that they made to hym tomuch sklender offers.

For furst he demaunded of theym all the countrey of Ionum with all the Islandes adioignyng to the same. And that same beyng agrede vnto by the Athenyans at the

                  elf as deceyued by Alcibiades, they departed in greate anger and disdeigne, and retourned to Samie. After that same, Tyssaphernes the selfe wynter sailled agayne to Caunus, to ioigne hymself a newe wyth the Peloponesians and to make allyance vpon suche conditions as he myghte, payinge vnto them the soulde or wages, at their pleasure, to the ende that they shoulde not become hys ennemyes, fearynge that if they were constrayned for to come to battaylle, by sea wyth the Athenyans, least that they shoulde be ouercome for lacke of men, considered that the more parte of them had not be payde, or ells that the Athenyans shoulde obteigne that, whiche they required wythoute hym: or happely that he feared more, least that for to recouer their paymente, they woulde waste and destroye the countrey of the kynge borderynge vnto theyme, whiche was in the mayne lande. For theis reasons than, and for to come to his intentes, whiche were to make the Grekes egall in force, hauyng caused the Peloponesyans to comme, he delyueredde theym paymente and soulde or wages, of the armye by sea, and dyd come to the thirde treatie wyth theym in this same manner and substance.
               
                  The thirde treatie of allyance bitwene the Lacedemonyans and the kyng Dareus.
                  THe thirtenth yeare of the kyng Dareus, Alexippidas,Alexippidas. being Trybune of the people at Lacedemonie, the treatie was made in the fielde of Meander,Meāder bitwene the Lacedemonyans & their allies of the one partie, & Tyssaphernes, Theramenes,Theramenes. and the childrē of Pharnacus on the other partie, touching the affaires bitwene the sayd parties. Furst that all the same whiche apperteigned to the kyng in Asia, shulde remayne to hym, and that he might determyne and dispose of his prouynce at his pleasure. That the Peloponesians nor their allyes shulde not enter into the kinges countrey, for to endomage it, nor lykewyse the kyng into the countrey of the Lacedemonyans nor of the allyes. And if any of the sayd allyes did the contrary, the other shulde prohybitt & resist them: and the king lykewise, if any of his subiectes did it in the lādes of the sayd confederates. That Tyssaphernes shulde pay the soulde or wages to the ships, which be presently ready, attending that those of the king shulde come, and than the Lacedemonians and their said allyes shulde wage and enterteigne theirs, at their proper costes & expences if they would, and if they rather desired that Tyssaphernes shulde paye the charge, that he shulde be bounde to lende thē monney, which shulde be rendred & repayde vnto him the warre fynysshed by the sayd allyes. That after that the kinges ships shulde be come, they shulde ioigne with those of the allyes & al togiders make warre against the Athenians, so long as it shulde seme good to the sayd Tyssaphernes, & to the sayd Lacedemonyans and confederates, & if it shulde seme good vnto thē to departe frō the said enterpryse, that it shalbe done wyth a comon accorde & not otherwise. Suche were the articles of the sayed treatie. After the whiche, Tyssaphernes vsed diligence to cause the ships to come frō Phenice, and to accomplishe all the other thinges, which he had promysed, and he shewed himself moreouer much affectioned vnto the enterprise. About the ende of the wynter, the Beotians did take the towne of

Orope,Orop

For the same towne of Orope, being in the lande of Erythree, which those Athenians did holde, it coulde not be, but yt the losse therof shulde tourne to their greate domage aswell to the cytie of Erythree as to al the Isle of Eubee. After ye same, the Erythreens sent to the Peloponesians that were at Rhodes for to cause thē to come into Eubee. But for that, yt thaffaire of Chio semed vnto thē more vrgent, for the necessitie, wherin the towne was, they refused the other enterprise, & departed frōthence for to saile to succour it. And passing nigh to Orope, they descriued the Atheniās ships that were departed frō Chalce,Chalce, whiche kepte the mayne sea, neuerthelas for that, yt they sailled to diuers voiages, the one came not against the other, but rather toke euery one his way, to witt, the Athenians to Samie, & the Peloponesiās to Milet, forsomuch as they perceiued wel that Chio coulde not be succoured withoute battaille, and in the meane time the ende of the wynter didde come, whiche was the twentith yeare of the warre, which Thucidides hath writtō. In the beginning of the furst spring, Dercilidas Spartian was sent with a smal nomber of men into Hellespont, for to cause the towne of Abide, to rebell against the Atheniās, whiche is a coloine of the Melesiens.

And so all those that were hable to fight, yssued fourth, and came to assaulte the Athenians very boldely, hauynge chosen a place of aduantage for theymself. And the combate was sharpe & dangerous on both sydes, wherin the Chiens shulde not haue had the woorse, but the night came vpon theym which departed them, and the Chiens retourned into the towne. In the self time Dercilidas being arryued by lande in Hellesponte, the towne of Abide, did fourthwith render it self into his handes & of Pharnabazus, and twoo dayes after, the citie of Lamsaque dyd the lyke, whereof, Strombichides, who was afore Chio, beynge aduertised, he came soubdaynly with, xxiiii, Athenians shipps for to succour and defende that same quarter, amōgest the which ships, there was barques that caryed mē at armes, Being thā arryued at Lamsaque, & hauing vainquisshed in battaille those of the towne, that yssued fourth againste theym, he did take euen at one comynge, the sayd towne, for that, that it was not walled, togiders with all those whiche were within the shipps, afterwardes hauinge restored the free men into the towne, he sailled fourthwith vnto Abyde. But seinge that there was no hope to take it nor apparence for to assiege it, he departed and did go to Seste,Sestus which is a cytie in the countrey of Cheronese, situated directly foranempst Abyde, the whiche the Medes had holden for a certene time, and therin he did putt a good garnison for the saulf garde and defence of all the countrey of Hellesponte. But in thies enterfeates by cause of the departure of Dercilidas, the Chiens, & also the Melesiās were maisters of the sea, whereupon Astyochus, vnderstandynge the combate by sea, whiche the same Chiens had had againste the sayd Athenians and the departure of the sayd Strombichides, he was more anymated and assured therein. And so he dyd come wyth two shyps and no more to Chio, and there he toke with hym all those that he founde there, and sailled straight to Samie. And seynge that the

ennemyes woulde not yssue fourthe to fight, for that, that they trusted not well the one the other, they retourned to Mylet.
               
            
            
               Howe a greate deuision happened amongest the Athenyans, aswell within the cytie, as wythout, chiefly in the army that was in Samie, by meane of the change of the estate and gouernance of the same, whiche did greatly endomage them. ☞The .x. Chapter.
               THe differente and controuersie of the sayd Athenyans was for that, that in the same tyme, the estate and gouernance of the towne, had bene changed at Athens, oute of the power of the comon people, vnto a smalle nomber. For Pysander and hys compaignions, beynge retourned to Samie, brought the army that was there, to their wylle and obeyssance, and one greate parte of the Samiens, chiefly they exhorted the prycipalle of the towne to take the gouernance thereof into their handes, althoughe that there were manye, whyche were wyllynge to maignteigne the common estate, wherby happened greate deuision and sedition bitwene them. Also the Atheniās, that were there in the armye, hauynge consulted vpon the thyng amonge themself, and seynge that Alcibiades was not earnest in the matter, they concluded to forsake hym, and not to calle hym agayne, for that, that it semed to theyme, that thoughe he dyd come agayne into the cytie, yet shulde he not be conueniente nor mete, for to order and gouerne the affaires vnder the gouernance of a small nomber, but rather was expediente that those that were there, of the estate, whereof was question: shulde deuyse the manner, howe that practique shulde be conductedde, and also howe the feate in warre shulde be pursued. Whereunto euery man of theym dyd readely offer to contrybute of hys oune monney and all other thinges necessarye, knowynge that they shulde no more laboure for the comons nor for any other, but for theymself. And so they sente againe Pysander and the moytie of the ambassadours whyche had bene sente towardes Tyssaphernes, vnto Athenes, for to geue order there in the affaires, and charged them, that through al the cyties whiche they shulde passe, of the obeyssance of the Athenyans, yt they shulde comytte the gouernance into the hande of a smalle nomber of the pryncypalles, and the other parte of the sayd ambassadours also departed & euerye one dyd goo into sondry places for to do the lyke. And also they ordeyned that Dyotrephes,Diotrephus. who was thā at the siege of Chio, shuld go into the prouince of Thrace, which was delyuered into his gouernance, who, in his departure from the sayd siege, passing through Thasse, abolisshed the comon estate, and comytted the gouernance into the handes of a small nomber of men. But being departed oute of the cytie, the greate parte of the Thessyans, hauing enclosed their towne wt wall aboutes one moneth after his departure, perswadedde themself to haue no more nede to be gouerned by those, which the Athenians had sett there, nor by y• meane to remaine vnder their obeyssance: but rather hopedde within shorte time to recouer entier lybertie through the ayde of the Lacedemonyans, for that, that their cytizeins, which were bannisshed by the Athenians, were withdrawin to Lacedemonie, and sollycited with their power, that shyppes shulde be sente vnto theym and that the towne myghte rebelle. So it chanced vnto theyme hooly in that same, as they desyred, whiche is, that the cytie wythoute anny danger was commytted into their lybertie, and the commons, whyche were bente to speake agaynste the estate of a smalle nomber, were wythoute hurte rebuke or offence

depryued of the gouernance, and to those that toke partie wyth the Athenyans, and vnto whome Diotrephes had betaken the gouernement, yt chaunced whole contrary to their thinkinges. And the lyke was done in many other of the cyties subiected to the Athenyans, which, consyderynge (as it semeth to me) that they shulde haue no more feare of the Athenyans, and that the same fourme of lyuing in their obeissance vnder the coulour of pollecie, was for trouth but a couloured seruitude or bondage, they attended al for a true lybertie. As touching Pisander and hys compaignions, that were gone wt hym, they comytted the gouernance of the cyties, through whyche, they passed, into the hande of a small nombere, at their pleasuer: and oute of some of the same, they dyd take souldyars, whyche they caryed wyth them to Athenes, where they founde that their complices and frendes, hadde already done many thynges, redoundinge to their intente for to abolishe the comons estate. For one Androcles, who had greate authoritie wyth the comon people, and that had bene one of the chiefest, that were cause of the bannishmente of Alcibiades, was slayne by a secrett conspiratie of some yonge compaignyons of the cytie for twoo purposes. The one for that, that he had tomuche authoritie wyth the comon people, the other for to acquire and gette the good wille of Alcibiades: who as they thoughte shulde haue comme agayne into authorie, trustinge that he wold make Tyssaphernes their frende. And for the selfe purposes they had by lyke meanes caused some other to be slayne, whyche semed vnto them, to be contrary vnto that practique: & also they had shewed vnto the comons by studyed and apparante narrations and reasons: that there shulde be no more wages payde but to those, that sarued in the warrre, and that in the admynistration of the comō affayres, no greater nomber shulde entermeddle, than of fyue houndred men, and chieflye of those, that were hable to sarue the comone weale, both wyth bodyes and wyth goodes: whyche thynge semed honnorable to the comon people, and those same, whiche were cause of the brynging downe of the comon estate, thought yet by that change to haue authorytie. For also the auncyent facyon of assemblynge the people and the counseille in alle affaires, of hearynge the opynyons of all men, and of followynge the greater nomber, didde stylle remayne. But nothing might be proponed or declared wythout deliberation of the small nomber, whyche hadde the authorytie. Amongest whom, there were that conferred a parte of all that shulde be proponed and sette fourthe for their intente: and whan they had said their opynyon, no man durst speake against yt for feare: seinge the great nomber and authorytie of the said gouernours. For also, whan any dyd speake against yt, meanes were founde for to cause him to dye: also they dyd no iustice, nothere make inquyrie for manquellers or murtherers: wherof the people were so afrayed and abashed: that they durste not saye a worde: and they thought that they dyd gett very muche by holdyng their peace or kepynge sylence, in that they receyued no other incomodytie and violence. And somuche the more they were in greater feare, that they doubted, leaste there had bene a much greater nōber of people in that same conspiracie, for it was not very easye to vnderstand, who were the coniuratours and accomplices or parttakers in that same secte, aswell for greatnes of the cytie and multytude of people, as also that the one dyd not knowe the intent of the other, and also dyd not complaine the one to the other, nother to discouer his secret vnto hym, nor to treate to take secrete vengeance therof. For the suspition and mystruste was so great through oute the people, that a man durste not truste, no not hys acquaintance and frendes, doubting leaste they had bene of the same cōspiratie, for that, that there was in yt suche thynges, as neuer were doubted. By reason whereof a man coulde no

more knowe, to whyche, of the comons he might truste, wherby the estate of the coniurators or parttakers was greatly assured, pryncypally bycause of the said diffidence or mistruste. Pysander and his compaignions than being come in the tyme of that same trouble, they brought to passe right easly, & in a small season, their enterpryse. And furst hauyng assembled ye people, they caused thē to consent to chose tenne grephiers and secretayries, the which shulde haue full power and auctorytie to pronounce to the people, that whyche shulde be deuysed to be putt in consultation for the welthe of the cytie at a daye, which was named. The whiche day beynge come and the assemblie made in a great felde, wherin was situ
                     •
                  
                  ted the temple of Neptunus aboutes tenne stades out of the cytie: there was no other thinge recyted by the grephiers, but that it was lawfull for to declare and publishe the decree of the Athenyans in whatsoeuer parte a man wold. And who soeuer shulde wryte that the pronouncer did againste the lawes, or otherewyse did him oultrage or empeshemente, shuld be greuously punished. Afterwardes, the saide decree was published, whiche was of this substance, that all the officers whiche were than in authoritie by the chosynge of the comons, shulde be abolisshed and sett of, and that no wages shuld be payde vnto them: & that they shuld electe fyue presedentes, who shuld afterwards name an houndred men, and euery of those, shuld choise three other, which shuld be in the whole foore houndred: who, whan they shuld come vnto the court, shuld haue full power & ample auctorytie to execute that, which shulde be determyned to be for the welth of the comon weale: and moreouer to assemble fyue thousand cytezeins, at all and asmany tymes, as they shuld thinke good. Pysander dyd pronoūce that same decre, who in the same, & in other things did willingly al that, which he learned to s
                     ••
                  ue for the extinguishinge and abrogation of the comons estate. But the said decree had already of longe tyme bifore bene made by Antiphon,Antiphō
                   who was in great reputation. For truly there was not at the same tyme in the cytie any man that exceaded him in vertue, and also he was very well aduysed and prudente for to fynde & counsaill in good, expedient & comon affayres: & moreouer he had a great grace to speke and declare them: and albeit that he neuer wolde come to the assemblie of the people, nother to any other cōtentious cōgregation, except that he were required: yet the comon people had him in suspition for the effycacitie & elegancie of his speakinge. And though that he wolde not entermedle in causes, yet euerye man that had any matter, were it iudiciall or touchinge the comons, he reputed that he had great fauour, yf he might haue hym for counsaillor. And aftere that the estate of foore houndred was abragated & that men proceded against those, whiche were the pryncipall authors therof, being accused as the other, he defended his case and answered therein in my conceyte better than anny man, to my remembrance, euer dyd. Phrynicus also shewed hymself greatly fauorable to the same comons estate, for feare of Alcibiades, whome he knew to haue vnderstanded al yt, which he had treated wt Astiochus being at Samie: for it semed to him that he wold neuer retourne so long, as the said gouernance of foore hoūdred endured. And also he was estemed a man vertuous & constant in great aduersities for yt, that mē had sene by experyence, that he neuer shewed himself that his herte failled him. Theramines also sone of Agnō was of ye chief & principall for to extinguish ye comon gouernemēt, who was a mā veray sufficient, aswel in worde as in dede. This worke being than conducted by so great nōber of mē of vnderstāding & of auctority: it was no maruail that it was brought to effect, though yt it semed and was for trouth a very difficile and harde thing to depriue the comon people of Athens frō their lybertie, which had bene & wherin they were about a hoūdred

yeares after that the tyrantes or euyll rulers were bannished. And they had not only bene exempted out of the subiectyon of all other: but also for, more than the halfe of the foresaid tyme, they had gouerned ouer other people. The assemble of the people beinge departed, after that they hadde approued and ratefyed the sayde decree, the foure houndred gouernours were afterwardes broughte into the courte, in thys manner. The Athenyans were contynually in armure by reason of the ennemyes, whiche were in Decelea, to wytte, the one for to warde the walles, the other the gates and other places, whereunto they were appoyncted. And whan the assygned daye dyd come for to do the sayde acte: those that were not of that coniuration or secte: were suffred to goo into their howses, as the custome was. And to those, that were of yt, was comaunded that they shulde tary, not in the place of their watche, and where their weapons were, but in some other parte therby, and that if they perceyued any that woolde resyste that, which was done or empesche or let yt, that they shulde repoulse suche wyth their weapons if nede were. And those, whiche were deputed and ordeyned therunto, were the Andrians, the Thenyans, three houndred of the Caristiens, and those of the cytie of Egyne, whyche the Athenyans had caused to come for to inhabitt there. The thynges beynge than so ordonned, the foure houndred chosen to the gouernance, euery of them bearyng a dagger hydde vnder his habillement or clothing, and wyth them sixe skoore yonge men for to assyste and strengthen them, whan it shulde be nedefull: entred all togiders into the pallays, where the courte was holden, and enuyronned the senatours, whyche dyd sitt in counsaill. Who aftere the custome declared their opynyons by blacke and whyte beanes, and so sayde vnto them that they shulde take their payment, for the tyme, that they had serued, and departed. Whiche payment the same foure houndred had brought thē, and as they yssued fourthe of the counsailles chamber, they delyuered to euerye of them their duties. And by that meane, they departed out of the court without makynge any resistence, and wythout that the reste of the comons ones styrred. And than the foure houndred dyd entre and choyse amonge themselfe certayne threasouriers and receyuours, and that done, dyd sacrefyce solempnelye for the treatinge of the sayde newe offycers. And by that meane the comone gouernance was hooly changed, and a greate parte of that, whyche was done byfore that time, was reuoked, resarued, that they did not calle agayne the bannished men, for that Alcibiades shulde not be comprysed therein. In the reste, the sayde gouernours dydde all thynges at theire wylle, and amonge othere caused some of the Cytezeyns to dye, doubtinge leaste that they shulde haue bene placedde in theire steede, for that they semed to them not to be for their purpose. Some other they dyd put into prysone, and some they bannyshed. That done, they sente vnto Agis kynge of the Lacedemonyans, who was at Decelea, an Heraulte: signefying that they woolde reconcyle themselfe wyth the Lacedemonyans, and shewynge hym that he myght conceyue and take more suertie and truste in them, than in the varyable and vnconstant comons. But he, whiche thought wel, that the cytie could not be but in trouble: and that the comons woolde not suffre their authorytie to be easely abolished, specially, if they parceyued any great army commyng byfore their towne: and that the estate of the sayde foure houndred was not so establisshed, but that it myght well be troubled, he made them no answer touchyng the appoynctement. But wythin fewe dayes after, he caused to assemble a greate nō
                  ber of men of warre, in the countrey of Peloponese, & wyth them and those, that he had Decelea, he came vnto the walles of the cytie of Athenes, trustynge that they wolde haue rendred themself to hys wylle, aswell for the trouble, that was

amonge them, both wythin and without the cytie, as also for feare, seing so great puissance at theire gates. And though that they woolde not doo yt, yet yt semed vnto hym, that he myght easely take the great walls by force, for that, that they were solitarie and required euer great watche and warde. But it chaūced wholy otherwyse, for the Athenyans dyd make no tumulte nor insurrection amongest themself, but they caused their horsemen and also one parte of their fotemen, aswell well armed, as lyght armed to yssue fourth, the whiche repoulsed incontynently, those, which were approched next vnto the wals, and did slay a great part of them, ye spoiles of whom, they caryed into the towne. Wherupon Agis seyng, that his enterprise did take no good effect, he retourned to Decelea, & certen days after hys retourne, he sent backe the strange souldyars, whych he had caused to come for that same enterpryse, and reteygned those, that he hadde furste there. And neuerthelas the foore houndred sente eftsones vnto hym for to treate the appoynctement, the whyche he did take in good parte, so that he perswaded them to sende Ambassadours vnto Lacedemonie for to treate the peace, whyche they greately desyred. On the other syde, they sente tenne cytezeins of their faction or secte, vnto those, that were at Samie, for to shewe them, amonge many othere charges, whyche they had, that the same, which they had done in changing of the comons estate, was not to the damage of the cytie, but for the welth therof, and that the auctorytie, was not in the power of foore houndred onelye, but of fyue thousand, and therby that it was asmuch in the handes of the comons, as bifore time it had bene: for somuch as at no affayre, that euer was treated vpon in the cytie as domesticall, nor wtin the self countrey as foreyne, there was neuer foūde vnder the comons gouernance so great a nomber, as fiue thousand men. And the foore houndred did sende this Ambassade vnto Samie, immediatly after the begynninge, fearing leaste those that were there of the army by sea, wolde not be agreable to that change, nother obey their gouernance, and leaste the euylland the discorde shuld beginne there, and afterwards come into the cytie, as it happened. For after ye time, that the sayd change was made at Athens, there was a mutyne and sedytion made in the sayd cytie of Samie, for the selfe occasion in this manner. For some Samyens, the whyche in fauoure of the comons estate, that was than in the cytie and for defence ther of, were reysed vp and in the armure against the pryncipalles of the towne that wolde haue vsurped the admynistration, did sone after tourne & changed their opynyon at the perswation of Pysander, whan he was come thider, and of other his followers and accomplices Athenians, whō he founde there. And willing to put downe the sayd comō estate, they assembled to the nomber of foore houndred fully determyned to assaulte and dryue awaye all those, that conducted the comon gouernance: pretendinge themself to be and represente all the comons. And at the arryuall they dyd slay an vngracious man, and one of an euill lyuinge an Athenyan named Hyperbolus,Hiperbolus. who was bannisshed oute of Athens, nother for suspytion nor feare, that annye man had of hys puissance nor of hys aucthorytie: but for synne and offence, and for that, that he procured shame to the cytie, togiders with one of the Dukes Athenyans named Charminus,Charminus. and some other Athenyans that were in hys compaignie, by whose counsail he gouerned himself. And they determined to procede further in fauour of the smal nōber. But ye other cytezeins taking partie wt the comon estate, which vnderstode this cōiuration or conspyratie, did discouer it, chiefly to some of ye capytains that were vnder ye charge of Diomedō & of Leon, dukes of ye Atheniās. The which dukes, for somuche as they had had that same charge & other honnours of the comōs, were not cōtent that ye auctorytie shuld come into hands of a smal

nomber. And lykewyse they discouered it vnto Thrasylus, wherof the one was patrone of a shipp, and the other capytayne of the men of warre, that were in the same: and also the sayd men of warre, whome they knewe to haue affection to the sayde comons estate: prayinge and requyringe that they woolde not suffer them to be so foyled and ouercharged by the sayde coniuratours, whiche had conspyred their death, nother also in suche affayre, to habandonne, the cytie of Samie, whyche shulde cause it to lose and wythdrawe the good wille, that it had borne to y• Athenyās, if they wold change the fourme of lyuing, which they had vsed vntyll that same time. This thinge, being so declared to the Chiefes and capitains, they did speke particulerly to the souldyars: perswading them not to suffre that same conspyratie to take effecte. And furste they practysed the compaignie of the Athenyans, that men call Pareles, and afterwardes all the free men, that were in that same Athenyan shyp, whych had bene both than & at all tymes byfore, contrarye to the estate and gouernance of the smalle nomber, and also were in good estymation wyth Diomedon & wyth Leon, in suche sorte, that whan they made any voiage in the sea, they delyuered vnto them willyngly the charge and warde of certayne shippes. Those same than beynge ioygned wyth those of the towne, that were for the comons estate, they de
                     •
                  yed the thre houndred coniurators that were chosen and putt in authorytie. Wherof they dyd slay thirty and bannisshed three of the pryncypal authors. They pardoned the othere, and restored the commons estate into his former auctorytie. That done, the Samyens and the Athenyan souldyars, that were there, did incontynently sende that same shippe wyth Parales togyders wyth that Capytayn and Patrone of the same ship, named Chereas, the sonne o
                     •
                   Archestratus, that was aydinge to that same busynes, for to aduertyse the Athenyans of that, whiche had bene there done, knowinge also that the gouernance of the cytie of Athens had bene putt into the power of four houndred. Who vnderstanding the commyng of that same shyppe, caused twoo or three of the sayde Parales to be taken and putte into prysone, and caused the other to be charged into other shyppes, and sent them into dyuers places of Eubea for to be suerly warded, resarued Chereas, who perceyuynge, whiche waye the wynde wolde blowe, hydde and saued himself: and afterwardes retourned to Samie, and reoported to those, that were there, alle that, whyche had bene done at Athens, and made the thynges muche greater, than they were: saying that all they that toke parte wyth the comons, were beatē and oultraged, wythout that, that there was any one parsone that durste hysse agaynste the gouernours: and that they oultraged and wronged not onely the men but also theire wy
                     •
                  es and children. And moreouer that they determyned the lyke to all those that were in the armye of Samie, that shulde be 
                     •
                  waruinge and discrepant from their will
                     ••
                   and to take their wyues, childrene and nexte parentes, and to cause them to dye if they wolde not condescende vnto their wylle. And the sayde Chereas reaported many other thynges, whyche were all lyes, wherby the souldyars were so spytefull and inflamed, that they were of opynyon to slay not onelye those, that hadde brought in the estate of a small nomber at Samie: but also those alle, that had cleued and consented therunto. Beynge declared vnto them by some, whiche entermedled for to quiett and appaysetheym, that in so doynge they shulde putte the cytie in danger to fall into the handes of the enemyes, whyche were in greate nomber in the sea, for to come to assaulte them, they dyd forbeare to do yt. And neuerthelas wyllynge to sett vp agayne openly the comon estate in the same cytie: Thrasibulus and Thrasillus, who were the chiefes and pryncypall conductours of that same practique, constrayned all the Athenyans, that were there in

the armye, and chiesly those, that toke partie wyth the gouernance of the smalle nomber, for to helpe with their power to defende the comon estate: and to follow (touchynge the same) that, whyche those capytains wolde do, and in that doinge to defende the cytie of Samie againste the Peloponesyans, and to take the foure houndred newe gouernours of Athens, for ennemyes: and not to make any treatie nor appoinctement wt theym. All the Samyens, whych were in age to beare weapons, made the lyke othe: vnto whō the souldyars made also othe, for to lyue & to die wt them in one self fortune. Reputing that there was none other hope of welth, nother for them nor for those of the towne. But rather they al did take theymselfe for loste, ayther yf the estate of foure houndred shulde take place at Athenes, orelles if the Peloponesyans shulde take the towne by force. In thies entrefaictes a longe tyme was employed ad lost, whylest the souldyars Athenyans that were in the army of Samie, wylled to restore the cytie of Athens to the comon estate: and those, which had the gouernance at Athens, to constraine those of Samie, to do as they dyd. But the souldyars beynge assembled for thys matter, they fourthwt deposed all the capytains & other, hauing charge in that same army, that were suspected to fauour the estate of foore houndred, and dyd putt other into their places. Of whyche nomber were Thrasybulus and Thrasillus,
                     Thrasybulus.
                     Thrasillus.
                   who the one after the other, exhorted all the souldyars to be constant in the same purpose for many reasons, whyche they declared vnto them: though that the cytie of Athenes had condescended to the gouernement of the said foore houndred. And amonge other thynges they shewed them, howe they themself were in greater nomber than those, whyche remayned in the Cytie, and also had greater habundance and facultie of all thinges than they, for somuch as hauinge the ships in their handes and all the army by sea, they myght constraigne all the subiected & confederated cyties, for to contribute monney. And if they were bannyshed out of Athens they had y• same cytie of Samie, which, was nayther smal nor weake, but rather the same of Athens, beyng depriued of the force by sea, wherin it pretended to excede al other: they shuld be sufficiētly puissant, for to chase away the enemys Peloponesyās, yf they shuld come to assault thē in Samie, like as they had done at other times: & also for to resiste those that were at Athenes, & for to be y• maisters, hauyng the ships in their handes, by meane wherof, they might haue victua

And that, whyche they had had vntill that same houre, which came to descende in the poarte of Pyreus, was by the meane and fauour of the army by sea, whych was there at Samie, which thyng they could no more haue, if they refused to restore the gouernance of the cytie into the handes of the comons: and therby, that those, whyche were there, myghte better empesche, and stoppe the vsage of the sea, fro those, that were in the cytie of Athenes: than the same that were in the cytie, from them.

Wherfore it was not to bileue that those amongeste them, whyche had bene authors of a better counsaille and opynyon in thys matter, than those: that were in the cytie: shuld be more meane

And on the other parte, yf they woolde offer vnto Alcibiades hys restorynge and hys reappeale: he wold ryght wyllinglye make the allyance and amytie bitwene them and the kynge. And if all other parties shulde faille them, hauinge so great an armye by sea: yet myght they saille into whatsoeuer such place, as they shulde thynke good, where they myghte fynde bothe cyties and landes for to inhabytte. Wyth suche sayings and perswations they anymated the one, the othere: & neuerthelas vsed all diligence for to prepare all thynges apperteigning to the warre. Whyche thynges perceyued by the Ambassadours, whyche the foore houndred sente thy der, to be already dyuulged and spredde abroade through the comons, they kepte sylence and dyd not expounde nor vtter their charge.
            
            
               ¶How Tissaphernes did come into greate suspytion of the Peloponesyans: aswell for that, that he abused them wyth the succours whyche he had promysed: as also for thys, that Alcibiades was restored and called agayn by the Athenyans that were in the armye, and had all the auctorytie wyth them, whyche he vsed to the welth and proffytt of his partie. ☞The .xi. Chapte.
               IN thies enterfayctes the Peloponesyans souldyars by sea, that were at Mylet: murmured and dyd speake openly agaynste Astyochus and against Tyssaphernes, saying that they destroyed & wasted all, to wit, Astyochus, for that, that he wolde not fyght, whan their armye by sea was weake, yea althoughe that they than were in a greate dyssentyon amonge theymself, and that their armye by sea was departed into many places, yet wold he not assaylle theym, but consumed the tyme vnder couloure of attendynge and taryinge the shyppes, that shulde comme oute of Phenice, and he dyd geue them succours wyth woordes, but not in effecte, wyllynge so to consume and destroye theym in expenses: and also he payde not intierly and continuelly the armye by sea, by occasyon whereof it was loste and destroyed. Wherefore they sayde that he shulde delaye them no moore, but saylle to assaulte the sayde Athenyans, and the Syracusayns moste instantely requyred hym thereunto. Astyochus and the other Chiefz that were there for the confederated cyties, being aduertysed therof, determyned to faight, vnderstandinge specyally, that there was greate mutyne and sedytion at Samie. So they assembled all the shippes, that they had, which were sixe skore and two at Micale, and fromthence aduertysed and cōmaunded those, which were at Mylet, that they shulde marche by land. Nowe the ships of the Athenyans were foore skoore and two in nomber, whiche were comme oute of Samie, into Glauca, in the countrey of Mycale. And it muste be vnderstande that the Cytye of Samye ys a lytle in lengthe of the lande frome the coas
                     •
                  e of Mycale. Fromewhence the Athenyans, seynge the Peloponesyans shyppes to comme agaynste theym, they retyred to Samye: for yt semed vnto theym, that they were not suffycyentlye stronge for to hazarde the battaille, wherein rested the question of the whole estate. And forsomuche as they hadde learned, that the ennemys dyd comme wyth an erneste wylle to fayghte: they saylled lokynge for Strombichides, who was at Hellesponte & shulde come thider wt the ships that he had broughte frome Chio to Abyde, whythe thinge they hadde commaunded him to doo, soone after that they retyred to Samie, and that the Peloponesians

came to Micale. In the whyche place, they had the same daye made their campe, aswell wyth men, whyche they had in their shippes, as wyth those, that were at Mylett, and also wyth the people of the countrey. And they determyned to go the morowe after to mete the enemys at Samie. But beinge aduertysed of the comynge of Stronbichides, they did retourne vnto Mylet, in the whyche place, the Athenyans determyned to go to presente them battaill, after that they shuld haue bene reforced or newe strengthened wyth the shippes, that Strombichides gouerned: for they were in all an houndred and eight shippes. But seing that the Peloponesyans wolde not issue fourth at large, they retourned vnto Samie. And after their departure, the Peloponesyans, although that they had so fayer and so puissante an army: yet neuerthelas reputinge not themselfe suffyciente for to fight agaynste the ennemyes, and not knowynge in the reste howe they might enterteigne that same army, specially seing that Tyssaphernes payed it not wel: they sent vnto Pharnabazus,Pharnabazus. Clearchus sonne of Ramphius,Clearchus. Capytain of forty shippes, ensuynge that whiche had bene already commaunded vnto them from Peloponese, for that, that the sayd Pharnabazus had promised to paye the army: and on the other syde, they did vnderstande that if they saylled to Bizance, the towne wolde tourne vnto them. So Clearchus launched fourthe wyth hys forty shyps keping the mayne sea
                     •
                   for not to be perceyued of hys enemyes. But there came vpon him soubdainly; tempest, so that his ships were disparsed and skatered abroad, & one parte, which followed Clearchus, sailled to Delos, y• other retourned to Mylet, and sone after did come agayne to the said Clearchus. Who came by lande into Hellesponte.Hellespō
                     
                        •
                     tus. But tenne shipps, whiche were bifore arriued at the sayde Hellespont caused the cytie to tourne to their confederation. Whereof the Athenyans, whiche were at Samie, beinge sone after aduertysed, sente a nō
                  ber of ships for to warde and defende Hellesponte, the which had a light battaill bifore Byzance: to wytt, eyght shippes of them, against the like nomber of the Peloponesians. In this meane tyme, they, that were chiefz of that same army for the Athenyans, and principally Thrasibulus (who had always bene of aduyse, that Alcibiades ought to be called home agayne, and also sithens that the estate of Athens was changed, by his meane) they were alwaies from muche into more in that purpose. And he declared it in suche sorte and so perswaded the souldyars, whyche were there: that they all agrede to the restoringe of the sayde Alcibiades: and the decree was concluded and put in wrytinge, by the whyche the sayde Alcibiades was pardonned, and that he shulde be called home agayne into the cytie. The whyche beynge so published, Thrasibulus wente vnto Tyssaphernes, and broughte the same Alcibiades wyth hym to Samie. Hopynge by hys meane to wythdrawe the sayde Tyssaphernes to the amytie of the Athenyans. Alcibiades, beinge arryued at Samie, caused the people to assemble, and proponed and declared vnto them, many greate losses and damaiges, whiche he had su
                     •
                  teigned in his bannishement: and afterwardes did speake profoundely, highly and wyttely of the affayres of the comon welth: in suche sorte, that he did put them in greate hope, to set it vp agayne: magnefyinge greatly the auctoritie, whiche he hadde wt the said Tissaphernes, to the ende, that those, which had the auctorytie and adm

                  nistration at Athenes, shuld be in feare of him, & by that meane their cōspiraties and confederations shulde be dissolued a
                     •
                  d weakened: and also that those, that were at Samie shulde conceyue and haue the more truste in hym, and by consequente, that he myghte be in more reputation, and that the ennemyes shulde the more mistruste the sayde Tyssaphernes and lose the hope, whiche they had to be ayded by him. For he sayde to the sayd Athenyans, that were at Samie, that

the same Tyssaphernes had promysed hym to paye the wages of their souldyars (yf he might finde and take suer truste in them) vntill the ende of their affayres: though that he shulde therefore sell asmuche as he was worth: and that he wold cause to come to their succour and ayde the Phenicians shyps, which were already in Aspendus, in stede of sendyng thēto the Peloponesyans. And for all ye assurance, he demaūded of them, but that they shulde receyue and take agayne ye said Alcibiades. Who hauing declared suche and lyke wordes, the capytains and souldyars did adioigne and adde hym to the nōber of the other chiefz of the army, & dyd geue him auctorytie for to order in all thyngs. And in effect they toke so great confidence and hope in him, that they made no maner of doubte in their welth: nother of the ruyne & fall of the foore houndred, also they were all ready euen at the selfe tyme, vpon confydence of that, whyche he had sayde, for to saille into Pyreus, wythout hauynge regarde to the enemyes that were there so nighe: but though that there were many that made greate instance to obteygne the same, yet wolde he not consente therunto, saying, that it was not expedient, hauing the ennemyes so nyghe, to saille into Pyreus. And that sithens that they had geuen the charge of the warre vnto hym, and had made him Chief, that he wolde prouyde for euery thynge wyth Tyssaphernes. Towardes whome he retourned incontynētly after the departure of that same assemblie, for to shewe and declare vnto them, that he woolde communicate and consulte wyth him in all thinges: & to the said Tissaphernes, that he was in great auctorytie with the Athenians, and was their chief, to the ende that he myght be the moore estemed of him, and that he shuld vnderstande that by the same meane, he might ayde and hurt him. Also it happened therin euen as he vnderstode yt: for through the fauour of Tissaghernes he helde the Athenyans in feare: and through the feare of them, the self Tissaphernes. Whan the Peloponesians, that were at Mylet, vnderstode the repeale and callinge home agayne, that was made of Alcibiades, hauynge already so great suspytion agaynst him: they begon to blame him openly. And for trouth in that, that they refused to saylle to encounter the armye by sea, whyche was come to presente them battaill, euen to Mylet, had caused the said Tissaphernes to be more colde to paye the soulde or wages of the sayd armye, togiders wt this, that Alcibiades had a right longe tyme trauailled and laboured to cause him to come into difference and dissention with the said Peloponesians. Thys bruyt beinge than come, vp the warryours, that were at Mylet, begonne to assemble thē self by trowpes, as they had done byfore time, & to make a great mutyne or sedytion. So that some amōgest them, men of auctorytie, saying that they had neuer had their entier paiment, & also that the s

By thys murmuraryon and mutyne, a greate tumulte ensued agaynste the sayde Astyochus. For the marroners of the Syracusains and those of the Thuriens, for that, that they were lesse subiected, than the other: made greatest instance, and that wyth sharpe and more prycking wordes, to haue their payment, than the other.

But afterwardes being come fourth fromthence, they dyd take hym, and besides that, the Mylesiens wente to assaulte a castelle or bulleworke, whyche Tissaphernes hadde there made, the whyche they toke, and chased fromthence hys men, that he had sette therein, whyche thynge was agreable to the other allyes, and also the other Syracusains. But Lychas was therwyth displeased, saying that the Mylesians and other, which were vnder domyny on of the kynge, shuld obey and please Tissaphernes in the thynges that were reasonable vntil that the affayres of the warre might haue bene better ordered: by occasion wherof, and of many other like declarations, the Mylesyans conceyued so great indignation against him, that, being sone after dead afa disease or maladie, they would not suffre that hys body shulde be engraued in the place, where the Lacedemonyans, that were there, had appoincted. In thies entrefaites and thies dissentions being amonge the souldyars: Tyssaphernes and Astyochus arryued at Mylet. Myndarus,Myndarus. beinge sente for chief of that same army from the Lacedemonyans in the stede of Astiochus: who after yt he had rēdred the charge to the said Mindarus he retourned to Lacedemonie, and Tyssaphernes sente wyth hym an Ambassadour of Gaulere named Cara,

For he had had of a longe tyme a meruelous hatred agaynste the sayde Tissaphernes by cause of the pay

                   the same Tyssaphernes had sharpely charged hym in their presence of many things and amonge othere, that the hatred, whyche he had agaynste hym, was for thys cause, that he would not delyuer vnto hym a certen some of monney, whyche he had demaunded of him. In thys manner Astyochus, the messengers of the Mylesians and Hermocrates sailled frome Mylet the Lacedemonye. And on the other syde Alcibiades retourned from Tyssaphernes to Samie. Beinge arryued at whyche place, certen messengers dyd come from Delos, whiche, the foure hoū
                  dred gouernours of Athenes had sente thyder for to pacefie & quyett those, that were in the sayd place of Samie. But at the begynnynge, the people beynge by them assembled, the souldyars made instance that no man shulde geue them audyence, but rather cryed wyth a lowde voyce, that men ought to hacke into pieces suche people, as woolde destroye the comone estate, neuerthelas after manye woordes, sylence was made, and they were hearde wyth greate difficu

                  tie: who declared howe the change of the estate, whych had bene made, was not for the destruction of the cytie, as they were done to vnderstande, but rather for the welth of the same, and to the ende that it shulde not come into the power of the ennemyes, who were comme vnto byfore the towne. Whereupone yt was deuysed to be necessarye to depute the sayde foore houndred to geue order to the defence, and in the affayres of the same, wyth the othere fyue thowsande, all the whych
                     •
                   shuld be parttakers in euery whatsoeuer thyng for the cōductyng or admynistratyon of the affayres. And also that yt was not trewe, whyche Chereas had spokene for enuye, that men had bannyshed and euyll intreated the Childrene, parentes and frendes of those, whyche were wythout: but rather suffred them all in their goodes, howses and in lybertie, as they had byfore tyme bene. But hauynge

made their excuses and declarations and wylling to passe further: they were empesched or interrupted by those Chartagians that were there, whiche toke that, that was sayde in an euill parte, and bigone to speake many and dyuers opynyons, but the more parte did put it fourth, that men shulde saille fromthence by vnto Pyreus. In the whyche trouble, Alcibiades shewed hymselfe asmuche or more frende to the partie, wherwyth he did take, than any of the other. For seing that the Athenyans, whyche were there, were mynded to saille agaynst those, that were at Athenes, and knowinge that if that dede were donne, it shulde be occasion, that the ennemyes shuld take all the contrey of Ionum and of Hellesponte, he wolde not suffre it, but rather did speake against it: whych thynge, none other but he, might do in the same furye. And by hys auctorytie he stayed that same nauigation: and also caused those to holde theire peace, whyche cryed agaynste the messengiers and blamed them openly. And afterwardes sente them agayne despeched by hymself in thys manner. To wytte, that as touchynge the fyue thowsand men, whiche were named for to ayde in the gouernance of the Cytie, he was not of opynyon, that they shulde be taken frō the gouernance, but he willed gladly that the foore houndred shulde be dysmyssed, and that the counsaill shulde be readmytted in the nomber of fyue houndred in like forme, as it was bifore. And somuche as touched that, whyche had bene made by the sayde foore houndred, for to dymynishe the expences of ye cytie for to fournishe the payment of the men of warre, he dyd right well allowe it, and exhorted them to prouyde well in the other affayres of the cytie, and not to suffer the cytie to comme into the handes and power of the ennemyes, geuinge them good hope for to appoincte and conclude all thies dissentions, the cytie remayninge in his entier estate, wythout that they shulde ryse in stryfe and armure the one agaynst the other, wherunto men ought to haue good regarde. For if they at any tyme shulde come to fight, to wit, those that were in the cytie, agaynste them that were at Samie, which of the parties shulde haue the victorie, there shulde none remaine with whom the appointement might be made. Nowe were come thider Ambassadours from the Argiues, which presented to the Athenyans that were there, ayde & succours against the foore houndred, for defence of the comon estate, vnto whome Alcibiades dyd render thankes for their good offres, and neuerthelas hauing demāded of them, who had prayed them to come thider for that matter, and they hauyng aunswered that they were not come thyder, as called by any parson: he 
                     •
                  ente them away graciously. And for trouth they had not bene required to come. But certayne Paraliens, beynge sente by the foore houndred in a shippe of warre for to saille to see what was done in Eubee, and also for to carye three Ambassadours, that those foore houndred sent to Lacedemonie, to wyt, Lespondias, Aristophon & Milesias: the said Paralians whan they were arryued at Argos rendred the sayd Ambassadours prysoners vnto ye Argyues, as those, which had bene the pryncipal authors & accomplices for to beate downe the comō estate of Athenes: and the sayd Paralians dyd not afterwardes retourne to Athenes: but did take in the Ambassadours of the Argiues, and did cary them in the ships to Samie. In the same somer, Tyssaphernes knowinge that the Peloponesyans had a ryght naughty opynyon of hym, aswell for other reasons, as also for the restorynge of Alcibiades, for the whyche, they presumed that he was reallied wyth the Athenyans, for to pourge hymself of that same suspition towardes them, he prepared hymsel

he lefte Tamus one of hys prouostes,Tamus to whome he dyd geue charge, as he said, for to paye the soulde or wages to the Peloponesyans maronners: howbeit yt appered afterwards that he was not gone to the sayd place of Aspendus for the same purpose. For he caused not the sayde ships to come, though that there were in the same place one houndred and .xv. all readye to saylle. And albeit that it can not be knowin for 
                     •
                  routh the cause wherfore he saylled thyder, and wherefore he caused not the sayde ships to come: yet were there sundry iudgementes pronoū
                  ced. For some did presume that he dydde it, for to enterteigne the affayres of the Peloponesyans vnder the hope of that his iourney: for also Tamus who he had lefte for hys Lieutenant payde no better than he had done: but rather woorse, the other iudged that he was gone thyder, for to recouer the monney, which was ordened for the soulde of the Phenycians by sendynge them home agayne: other presumed that he was gone for to abolishe the euyll opynyon, whyche the Peloponesyans had of hym, and for to shewe them that he was wyllynge effectuously to helpe thē: sithens that he sailled for that same army by sea, which was knowin to be readye. But as for me I holde yt for mooste certayne, and the thinge is clerelye euydente, that he was not mynded to brynge hys shippes, but to dyssimule in that voyage to the ende, that in attendynge hys commynge, the affayres of the Grekes shulde comme into confusion: and that by not geuynge ayde to the one partie nor to the other, and frustratynge and deceyuinge theym both, they shulde remayne egall and weake. For yt was veray notoryous that if he hadde bene wyllinge to ioygne wyth good purpose and syncerely wyth the Lacedemonyans, they myghte than haue obteign
                     •
                  d the victorie. For that, that in the selfe seasone they were of themself as puyssante by sea, as the Athenyans. And the excuse, that he made for that, that he hadde not broughte the shippes: declared euidently his malice & deceyte. For he sayd, that it was not for that, that the Phenicians had not fournyshed suche nomber of shippes, as he had appoincted them. And yet neuerthelas it is to belieue that the kynge wolde haue bene ryght ioyefulle that he myghte haue done the selfe effecte wyth lesser nomber, and by consequente wyth lesser expences. But for whatsoeuer intente that he dyd yt, the Peloponesyans by hys order, dyd sende twoo galleys wythe hym to the sayde place of Aspendus, of the whyche was Chiefa Lacedemonyan, named Philippe. On the other syde Alcibiades vnderstandynge the voiage of Tissaphernes, did take xiii. ships of those, that were at Samie and sailled into that same quarter: doing the Athenyans to vnderstande, that were at the sayde Samie, that hys iourney shulde proffit theym greatelye. For he woolde compasse it that the same armye by sea, whyche was at Aspendus, shulde comme to their succours, orells shulde not go to the ayde of the Lacedemonyans, and therof assured theym, knowinge (as it is to be beleued) the wylle of the sayde Tissaphernes, by the comunication whyche he had hadde wyth hym: whyche was, for no

So he sailled towardes hym, kepyng alwayes the mayne sea from the coaste of Phaselide and Cumus.
            
            
               
               ¶Howe the Athenyans, beyng come into greate deuision and dissensiō among themself, by cause of the common estate, whiche had bene changed, assembled to come to some accorde and appoynctmente. ☞The .xii. Chapter.
               DUrynge thys tyme, the ambassadours, whiche the foore houndred had sente to Samie, beynge arryued and retourned to Athenes: they made their reporte of the charge, that Alcibiades had geuen them, to wytt, that they shoulde geue theymeselfe to warde and kepe well the cytie, and defende theymselfes agaynste the ennemyes, and that he had hope for to reconcyle those that were in the armye at Samie, and also for to vainquyshe the Peloponesians. Whiche woordes dyd geue greate courage to manye of the foore houndred, whiche were already cloyed and anoyed wyth that same fourme of gouernemente and woulde wyllyngly haue wythdrawin them self if they had thought them to be hable to do it wythoute danger: so that all with one accorde dyd take the administration of the affaires, hauyng specyally the two pryncypall men, and the moste puissante of the cytie for their chiefes, to wytte. Theramenes,Theramenes. sonne of Agnon, and Aristocrates,Aristocrates. sonne of Sicillius, & besydes those same, manye other of the moste apparente and excellente of the assemblie of the foore hoū
                  dred, who excusedde theymself, of this that they had sente ambassadours to the Lacedemonyans, sayinge that they dyd it for feare of Alcibiades, and of othere that were at Samie, to the ende that the cytie shulde not be offended. And it semed to theym that men myght exchue, that the gouernemente shulde not come into the handes of a smalle nomber, if it were ordeined that the fyue thowsande, that had bene named by the sayd foore houndred, myghte haue the auctorytie in effecte and not in worde: and that by the same meane the estate myght be refourmed in an other sorte to the welthe of the cytie. Whereof albeit that they made alwayes mention in their propositions, yet neuerthelas the more parte of theym dyd wrynge yt to their particuler proffytt, to ambition and auctorytie, hopynge that in abatynge the sayd gouernemente of foore houndred, they shoulde be not onely egall to the other, but also superyours. And moreouer in the comon estate. euery one endured and suffred the rather or better wyllynge a repoulse, for that-that the offices were geuen by election of the people: than in the estate of the particulers, for it semed vnto hym, not to haue bene repoulsed by hys egalls, whan that it was done by the people. And for trouth the auctorytie, which Alcibiades had wyth theym at Samie, dyd geue greate courage to thies here, ioigned, that it semed not to theym good, that the same estate of foore houndredde shoulde endure, wherefore euerye one of theym inforced hymself, the moste that he myght, to acquire and get credytt with the people, for to be pryncipall in auctorytie Neuerthelas, those, which were the pryncipalles of the sayd foore houndred, trauailed to the contrarye somuche, as they might, and chiefly Phrinicus,Phrynicus. who, whilest that he was Duke and chief of those, that were at Samie, had bene contrary or aduersary to Alcibiades. And also Astiochus,Aristarchus. who had alwayes bene contrary to the common estate, and lykewyse Pysander,Pysāder Antiphon and the other,Antiphō
                   that were the moste puissante in the cytie, who, after the tyme that they had embrased and takene the admynistration, and also after the change and sedition, that had bene at Samie: sente ambassadours of their oune bodyes and conueyde them to Lacedemonie, and wente aboute to maignteigne the gouernemente of the smalle

nomber wyth all their power, and also caused the walle of Eetione to be repaired and heighthened. And after the retourne of their ambassadours, whcihe they had 
                     •
                  ent to Samie, seing that many of their oune secte changed their wylle, who had bene taken for constante and fully determyned in the affaire, they sente readelye Antiphon and Phrynicus, with tenne other of their bende eftesones to the Lacedemonyans, and did geue them charge for to appoynct with them, for and vpon the lesser euyll that they myght, prouyded that the appoynctmente shulde be tollerable. And this did they for feare that they had aswell of those, that were at Athens, as of those, whiche were at Samie. And as touchynge the wall, that they repaired and heighthenened at Eetione, they dyd it) as Theramenes sayed, and those that were wyth hym) not somuche for to empesche that they, whiche were at Samie might not enter into the porte Pyreus: as for to receiue the army by sea and by lande of the ennemyes, whā they would, forsomuch as the same place of Eetione ys at the entrynge into the poorte of Pyreus, in manner of a cressente or half a circle, whereby the walle, whyche they made for the coaste of the lande, rendred the place so fortefyed, that it shulde be in their power wyth a small nomber of people, that they myght putt wythin yt, to suffer the shyppes that shulde comme to enter or for to empescher or kepe theym fourth, for that, that the same place ioigneth to the other tower of the poorte, whyche hathe a veray straite entrynge, and besydes that reparation which they made at Eetione, they repayred the olde walle, that was wythoute Pyreus, of the coaste of the lande, and buylded a newe wall wythin yt of the coaste of the sea, and bitwene both, made great halles and Stoarehouses, into the whiche they constraynedde euerye one of the towne to brynge and bestowe the corne, whiche he had in hys house, and also the same, that was from without by sea, they caused to be discharged there, and they that were mynded to haue therof, were constrayned to go and buy it there. Theramenes, had already (bifore that the later ambassadours wente frome the foore hoūdred to Lacedemonie) diuulged and opened theis thinges, to witt, that the foore houndred did make the sayd reparations & prouisions for to receyue the enemys. But after yt they were retourned without doing any thing, he did speake & publishe more openly yt the same wall, which was caused to be made, shulde be cause of puttinge the estate of the cytie into danger, for at the self tyme dyd come thider, xlii, ships of the ennemis, wherof the one parte were Italians & Siciliens, that came frō Peloponese, to witt, of those that were sente into Eubea: & certene other were of those, that were lefte in the porte of Ye,Ya. in the countrey of Laconie, of whom Agisandridas,Agisandridas. sonne of Egisander, the Spartian was chief, wherupon Theramenes sayd, yt they were not arryued there, somuche to saylle their voiage of Eubea, as for to ayde those that made the sayed walle of Eetione, and that if they made not verye good watche, there was greate danger leaste they shoulde take Pyreus secreatly or by stealthe. And that whyche Theramenes and those that were wyth hym dyd speake, was not wholy lyes, nor sayed for enuye. For truely those, whyche helde the estate of a small nomber at Athens, would gladly (if they myghte) haue gouerned the cytie in lybertie and vnder their auctoritie, and to haue bene hable to commaunde the subiectes, in the name of the sayd cytie, as representing the common welth. But if they coulde not defende and maigteigne their auctoritie, they were determined (hauing the porte, the ships and the forteresse of Pyreus in their hande) to lyue there in suertie, fearing least if the people dyd retourne vnto their former common estate, they shulde furst be destroyedde. And if than they myght not saue and defende theymeself there: rather than to fall into the handes of the people, they determyned to lett the ennemyes into

Pyreus, but so that they shulde not haue nother the shypps nor the fortresses in their handes, and to capitulate and conferre wyth them 
                     •
                  ouchynge the estate of the cytie, the beste that they coulde, so that their parsones myght be saued. For thies respectes they kept good watche and warde, on the walles & in the portes, and in the reste they aduaunced theymself, the moste that they myght to buylde the places, where the ennemyes myght haue entryng and passage forth: fearyng to be soubdainly takene and preuented, the which enterpryses and delyberations were furst deuysed and treated vpon amonge a fewe people. But sithens Phrynicus, after hys retourne oute of Lacedemonie, was hurte in the myddest of the markett place, by one of those that warded, wheeupon anone after hys retourne frome the Palais, he dyed: and the same man that dyd hurte hym, fledde awaye. But an Argiue, that had ayded hym, was by order of the foore houndred taken, who beynge racked and demaunded, to tell who had caused hym to do it, coulde name no parsone. And he sayd that he knewe none othere thynge, but that in the house of the capytayne of the watche, and of manye other cytizeins, a great nomber of people dydde oftentymes assemble. Whereupon, and throughe occasion of that same newes, Theramenes, Aristocrates, and the other, whiche were of their confederatie, aswell of the nomber of foore houndredde, as other, were the more chaffed and heated in their enterpryse. And somouche the more, that the armye by sea, the whiche was at Ye, hauyng takene the poorte and soiourne at Epidaure, made manye coursynges and pillages, in the lande of Egyne. Wherefore Theramenes sayd, that it was not to be bileued that if the sayd armye had bene wyllynge to saille into Eubea, that it woulde haue come coursynge vntyll the goulphe of Egyne, for afterwardes to retourne to Epidaure, except that they had bene called by those whyche helde and fortefyed Pyreus, lyke as he had alwayes said. For this cause, after manye declarations made vnto the people for to cause the comons to reise agaynst theym, it was fynally determyned to take Ye, by force. Ensuyng the which delyberation, they yt were busyed at the fortefyinge of Fetione, ouer whome Aristocrates was chief, did take one of the nomber of foore hoū
                  dred, whiche neuerthelas helde secretly the contrary parte, named, Alexicles and warded hym in hys oune house,Alexicles. and after the same, they toke many of them, and amonge other, one of the capytaynes that had the wardyng of Munichie,Munichie. named Hermon, and that was done by consente of the greateste partie of the souldyars. The whyche thynge beyng signefyed to the foore houndred, whych at that tyme were in the pallais of the towne (resarued those, that was not pleased wyth the gouernemente) determyned to take their armure & weapons, for to geue charge vpon Theramenes and those whiche were wyth hym. Who excusynge hymselfe sayd that he was ready for to saille to Ye, to apprehēde and take those, that made suche nouelties. And so he dyd take one of the capytaynes, whyche was of hys wyll and mynde, wyth hym, and went to Pyreus. Unto whom Aristarchus and the horsemen were aydynge, whereby a greate and horrible tumulte was incontinently stirred vp. For they that were wythin the cytie, sayd playnly, that Pyreus was taken, and all those that were founde wythin yt, were slayne. And on the other syde, those, whiche were wythin Pyreus, thought that al those that were in the cytie, had come against them. So that the auntyente of the cytie had ynough to do for to kepe the cytizeins frome puttynge theymeselfe alle into armure, and therin Thucidides the Pharsalien trauaylled greatly with them.
                     Thucidides.
                     Pharsilianus.
                   Who, hauyng had greate amytie and acquaintance wyth manye amongeste them, laboured to appaise theyme wyth swete woordes, requyrynge and exhortynge theyme, that they shoulde not wylle to putt the cytie into danger of destruction, hauynge the

ennemyes so nyghe, whyche layde in wayte for theyme, by meanes of whyche declarations, the furye was appaysedde, and all wythdrewe theymeselues into their houses. Durynge thys tyme, Theramenes, who was officier wyth the othere beynge at Pyreus, made semblante, wyth woordes onely, to be angrye agaynste the footemen well armedde. But Aristarchus and those of hys bende, whiche were of the contrary faction or secte, were for trouth, throughly displeased agaynste theym. The whyche for all that, ceassed not to procede in their busynes and worke, vntylle that some of theym demaunded of Theramenes, whider yt semed vnto hym for the beste to fynyshe the walle, or to rase it downe. For beynge by hym aunswered, that if it pleased theym to grynde it downe, he woulde not therewyth be angry: incontynently all those, whiche wrought, and manye of the othere that were in Pyreus, mountedde vpon the sayed walle and in a veray shorte tyme, broughte it to grounde. And in that doynge, to thintente to encouraige the people vnto their purpose and wyll, they sayd with a lowde voyce vnto the standers by, thies wordes. Whosoeuer hath more desyre that the fyue thousande shall gouerne, rather than the foore houndred, he oughte to doo this, whiche we doo. And that dyd they saye for to declare that they were not wyllyng to sette vp agayne the common estate: but rather shewed theymself concented, that the fyue thousande shoulde gouerne, fearynge leaste that it shulde eskape to any of those, whyche pretended to haue anny gouernaunce in the sayd comon estate, for to name it by errour or ouersyght, by speakynge the one to other, wherof the foore houndred were muche astonyed, for that, that they were not contente that the sayd fyue thousande shoulde haue auctorytie, nor also vnderstande that they shulde be deposed. For in that doyng it shulde come agayne, to the comon estate, also in geuynge theym the auctorytie, yt shoulde in manner be all one, the auctorytie beynge in so great nomber of men. And so this facion of not declarynge the thynge helde the men in feare, asmuche of the one syde as of the other. The morowe followynge, the foore houndredde, althoughe that they were yet in greate trouble assembled togiders in the pallais. On the other syde those, whiche were in armure in Pyreus, hauynge rased downe the walle, and releassed Alexicles, whome they had bifore apprehended, they went into the Theatre or guylde hall of Dyonisius, that is to saye of Bacchus, whyche is bifore Munichie within Pyreus. So they helde there their counseylle, and after hauynge debated vpon that, whyche they had to doo, they concluded for to goo into the cytye, and there to bestowe their armure in the place accustomed, whyche thynge they dyd. And they beynge vnarmed, came manye cytizeins, sente secretly frome the foore houndred, whyche addressed and repayred to those, whyche they knewe to be moste tractable, prayinge theym, that they shoulde kepe the peace wythoute makynge annye trouble or tumulte in the cytie, and also to defende, that the othere dydde yt not, shewynge theyme, that they all togiders myghte name the fyue thowsande that shulde haue the gouernance, and putt into the same nomber the foore houndred to suche charge and aucthoritie, as they shoulde thynke good, for to kepe the cytye frome danger of comymnge into the power of the ennemyes. Throughe whiche declarations and requestes, whiche were made by dyuers men in dyuers places and to dyuers personaiges, the people was greatly quyetted, fearynge leaste their dissention, shulde come to the ruyne and destruction of the cytie. And in effecte yt was generallye agreede, that at a certene day, an vniuersall assemblie of the people shoulde be made wythin the temple of Bacchus.
            
            
               
               Howe the Peloponesians had a vicorye by sea agaynst the Athenyans, nigh to Erithree. And afterwardes howe the gouernance of the foore houndredde was abrogated, and the sedition in the cytie by that meane appaised. ☞The .xiii. Chapter.
               THe people, beyng at the day assigned, assembled in the temple of Bacchus: bifore that any thyng had bene proponed and declared, newes came, that, xlii, shyppes were departed frome Megare, for to comme to Salamyne, vnder the conducte of Agisandridas. Which thyng semed to the people, to be the effecte of that, whiche Theramenes and his followers had sayd bifore, that the armye by sea of the ennemyes, would come straight to the walle, whyche was in buyldynge, and that for the same cause it was expediente for to rase it downe. And yt myghte be, that Agisandridas, kept hymself aboutes Epidaure, and other nygh places of a sett purpose, knowyng the dissension wherein the Athenyans were, for to execute some good thynge, if he myghte see occasion and oportunitie. The Athenyans vnderstanding than theis newes, departed all ronnyng into Pyreus, reputyng the same domesticall and intestyne warre, more greate and more dangerous, than the same of the ennemyes, and beyng bifore their poorte, more than if it had bene in anny other place further of. For thys cause some dyd caste theymself into the shippes, whiche were ready and tacled within the poorte: the other they did bringe to shoare, and trymmed those whiche were not ready: and the other mounted vpon the walles, that were at the entrynge of the sayd poorte, for to defende it. But the Peloponesyans shyps, hauynge passed Sunie saylled or kepte their way, bitwene Thorice and towardes Prastie, and came fromethence to aboorde at Orope. Whiche parceyued, the Athenyans did soubdainly apprehende and take the maroners, which they founde readye (lyke as the custome is to doo in a cytie, whyche is in Ciuille warre, and in greate danger of ennemyes) for to wythstande yt. For also all the comforte and succours, whyche they than had, was oute of Eubea, the coaste of the lande beynge occupyed by the ennemyes. And so they sente Tymocrates, with the shyps that they coulde than make readye into Erithree, whyche after, that he was arryued hauynge in all, xxxvi, shypps, those same comprysed, which were bifore alreadye in Eubea: he was constrayned to fight, forsomuche as Agisandridas hauynge already dyned, was departed frome Orope, and dyd come agaynste Erethrie, whiche is not distante from the said Orope but three skoare stades by sea. The Athenyans, than seynge the armye of the ennemyes comynge in battaylle agaynste theym: they mounted soubdaynly into their shypps, thynkynge that the souldyars shulde haue fourthwith followed thē, but they were skatered through all the quarters of the towne, for to make prouysion of victuailles, for that, that the burgeoses of the same had maliciously founde meane that there were no victuailles to be solde in the markett, to the ende that the sayd souldyars, being occupyed to serche victuailles through the towne, they myght not in tyme mount into the shyppes, and by that meane that the ennemyes myght betrapp or soubdaynely take them. And also they in the reste conuenanted wyth the ennemyes to make theym a signe, whan they shoulde perceue that yt were tyme, for to assaile the sayd Athenyans shypps. Whyche thynge they dyd. And notwythstandynge all this, the Athenyans, that were in the shyps wythin the poorte, susteigned a good whyle the force of the enemyes, but at the ende they were constrayned to putt theymself in flyght. So they were followed by the ennemyes euene vnto

the shoare of the sea, whereupon those, whyche retyredde into the towne as into the lande of frendes, were by the burgeosses, villaynously slayne. But those, whiche retyred into the fortes, that the Athenyans helde, were saued. And lykewyse the shyps, that coulde saylle vnto Chalcide were saued. But the other that were to the nomber of, xxii, were takene, with all those, that were in them, maronners and othere, whereof some were slayne, and the other deteigned prysoners, and by reasone of the same victorye, they reysed vp there a Trophee and wythin a small tyme after, they brought all the Islande of Eubea, into their obeyssance, excepte Oree,Oreum whiche the same Athenyans dyd holde, and also compounded with all the places borderynge thereaboutes. Whan the newes of the same ouerthrowe, dyd comme to Athenes, all the people were afrayde asmuche or more, than of annye thynge, that had euer happened vnto theym. For although that the ouerthrowe, whyche they had receyued in Sycille had bene of greate ymportance, and many other losses whyche they had had at dyuers tymes: yet the hoste whyche was at Samie, beynge tourned and rebelled agaynste theym, and not hauynge nother more shyps nor men to putt in theym, and they theymselues moreouer in suche dissension in the cytye, that they dyd but attende and watche the houre for to inuade the one the othere: to haue presently loste, after so manye calamyties and myschances, euene at one instante all the Islande of Eubea, oute frome the whiche they had more succours than oute of their oune lande of Athenes: it shoulde haue bene a ryght strange thynge, yf they had not bene thereof astonyed. And somuche the more that the sayd Islande beynge so nyghe vnto the cytie, they feared greatly leste the ennemyes in the furye and heate of the same victory, would haue come fourthwyth, all wyth one power, into Pyreus, the whych being wholye vnprouyded of shypps, if they had had couraige, they myght well haue done, and chiefly they myght haue assaulted the cytie, the whiche by that meane shulde haue come yet into greater deuysione, or at the leste assieged it. By whych doynge those that were in the armye by sea of the Athenyans in Ionum, thoughe that they were aduersaries, and agaynste the gouernemente of the foore houndredde, shoulde yet haue bene constrayned for their particuler interest and for the welth of their cytie to habandone & forsake the sayed countrey of Ionum, for to come, to the succours of their cytie. And by that meane all the countrey of Ionum, of Hellesponte, and the Islandes that be in that same sea aboutes Eubea, and in effecte all the Empire and the seigniorye of the Athenyans shulde haue come into the power of the Athenyans. But the Lacedemonyans, bothe in the same and in manye othere thynges were muche proffytable to the Athenyans, and pryncipallye throughe the multytude and dyuersitie of people that there in their compaignie, who were muche differente, contrary and disagreynge, bothe in wylle & in manner of lyuing. For some of them were hasty and dyligente: the other slacke and loyterynge, some hardye and the other fearefull, and specially touchyng the feate by sea, they were in great discorde, whych redounded to the greate proffytte of the Athenyans. And that myght be welle knowyn by the Syracusayns. Who, for that, that they were all of one accorde and of one wylle: dyd greate thynges, and had faire victoryes. And for to retourne to the hystorye, the Athenyans hauynge lerned theis newes, in whatsoeuer manner and necessitie that they were, they neuerthelas armedde twentye shyppes, and fourthwyth at the selfe houre, they assembled togider in the self place of Pyreus, and at an other tyme, in a place whyche they name Picne,Picne. wherein they had at othere tymes accustomed to assemble theymself, and it was concludedde in the same assemblies that the foore houndred shoulde be deposed, and that the auctorye shoulde be in the handes of

fyue thousande, of the whyche nomber, all those myght be, that coulde beare armure and that would sarue in the offyce without wages, and whosoeuer would do otherwyse, shoulde be abhorred and execrable. Afterwardes there were manye othere assemblies, wherein dyuers lawes and ordonances were made touchynge the admynistration of the common welthe. And in the begynnynge therof, it semed to me that they made manye good thynges for the conductynge of the common affaires to the welthe of the cytie, reducynge and bryngyng the dissension that 
                     •
                  as amongeste theyme, by cause of the particuler and common gouernement, vnto a good meane, whiche was occasion for to cause manye euilles thynges that were done in the cytie to ceasse, and by that meane maigteigned yt. Moreouer they ordeyned that Alcibiades and the other which were wyth hym shoulde be reapealled and called home agayne, and lykewyse that yt shoulde be commaunded to theyme that were at Samie, that they shoulde comme for to ayde to geue order in the affaires of the citie. In thies enterfeates, Pysander and Alexicles and some othere of the nomber of foore houndred wythdrewe themself to Decelea. But Aristarchus, whiche was their chief wythout other compaignie of theyme, dyd take a certene nomber of Archers, whyche were there of the moste barbarous or estrangers, and departed fromethence to Oenoe,Oenoe. whyche ys a castelle that the Athenyans helde in the frontiers of the Beotiens, whome the Beotiens dydde kepe assieged by cause of certene murthers, that those, of the sayd castelle had commytted and done to their people, and there were wyth him certene Beotians that were comme of their oune mynde. Aristarchus being there arryued, he treated wyth the sayd Corynthians and Beotians to cause the place to be rendred vnto theym. And so he dyd parlamente and speake with those that were wythin yt. Doynge theyme to vnderstande that the appoynctmente was made of alle the othere differences and questions bitwene the Lacedemonyans and the Athenyans. Wherfore it was requisitt that they shoulde render the sayd castell to the Beotians. Unto whyche wordes and declarations, those that were wythin it (who knewe nothynge of that, whyche was done, as people that be assieged) dydde geue credytt and fayth, for that specially, that the sayd Aristarchus was the chief of the foore houndred, and so rendred the place by composition. In suche manner the gouernemente of the smalle nomber ceassed at Athens, and by that meane the sedition and deuision of the cytizeins.
            
            
               Howe the armyes by sea aswell of the Athenians as of the Peloponesians, sailledde into Hellesponte, and there prepared themself for to fyght. ☞The .xiiii. Chapter.
               IN the self season, the Peloponesians, that were at Mylet, dyd knowe manifestly that they were abused by Tyssaphernes, aswelle for that, that none of those (to whome he had commaunded, whan he departed to saylle at Alpendus, that they shoulde haue payde the sayd Peloponesyans their soulde or wages) nother hadde delyuered theym any thynge, nor also there was any newes of the comyng againe of the same Tyssaphernes, nor of the shypps that he shulde bryng out of Phenice. But Phillippe that was gone thider with him, had wrytton to Myndarus,Myndarus. chief of the army by sea that

And for to doo the thynge more secrettly: bifore that the Athenyans, that were in Samie parceyued yt, wyth the greateste diligence that he coulde, he departed frome the sayd Mylet wyth, lxxiii, shyppes, and dyd take hys iourney towardes Hellespont,Hellespontus. whider in the self somer were also gone, xii, othere, the whiche had made many coursynges and pyllaiges in one quarter of Cheronese. But he being in the goulf of the sayd Cheronese, was taken with a storme or pyrrye, and was constrayned to wythdrawe to Icare,Icarus. & there to soiourne fyue or syxe dayes, attendynge that the sea myghte be appaised and quietted, & afterwardes to saille to Chio. In the meane tyme, Thrasylus, who was at Samie, was aduertised, howe that same Myndarus was departed from Milett. So he departed wyth, lv, shyppes in the greateste haste that he coulde, for to be the furste in Hellespont. But beynge aduertised that the armye of the ennemyes was at Chio, and thynking that it would haue soiourned there certene dayes, he set espyes into the Isle of Lesbos, and also in the mayne lande, that is in the quarter oueranempste the Isle, to the ende that the sayd ennemyes shoulde not passe, but that he shoulde be aduertised thereof. And he, wyth the reste of the armye saylledde to Methymna,Methimna. where he caused flower and othere victuailles to be takene in, for to saille frome Lesbos to Chio, yf that the ennemyes woulde longe haue soiourned there.

Who, hauynge called out of the cytie of Cumes aboutes fyftie good men, their frendes and allyes, & soulded or waged aboutes three houndred souldyars of the mayne lande, vnder conducte of a citizeine of Thebes whiche they had chosene, for the amytie & allyance, that they had wyth the Thebayns: were saylled by sea straight to Methymna, thynking to enter therin by force, but their enterpryse did take no effecte. For they being entred into it, the Athenians, that were at Mytilene in garnison: did come soubdainly to the succours of the burgeoses, and hauynge sought agaynste the sayd bannysshed men, constrayned theym to yssue fourth agayne in the night out of the towne, and dyd go straight to Erese, the which they constrayned to receiue them and to rebell from the Mythileniens. Thrasilus with all his armye than beinge there arryued, prepared himself, for to assault the towne. And on the othere syde, Thrasibulus, who had bene aduertised at Samie, of the comyng of the sayd bannysshed men to Erese, was already come thider bifore with fyue shyps, and moreouer two other shyppes dyd arryue there after the comyng of Thrasillus, whiche came out of Hellesponte, and sailled fromethence home to their houses, in suche sorte that aswelle wyth the shypps that were at Methymna, as wyth the other, that were come thider, there were to the nomber of, lxvii, which caryed, men, artillery and Engynes, for to take Erese. In the meane tyme Myndarus wyth the Peloponesyans shyppes, hauynge made prouision of victuailles, for the space of twoo dayes at Chio, and receyued the payemente of the souldyars by those of the towne, to wytte, xliii pence for euery one: the thirde daye they launched fourth, and fearynge to encountre and mete the shypps, that were

And incontinentlye as they hadde dyned, they passed alongeste of the lande of Cumes and dydde comme for to supper in the towne,Cumes. of Arginusse,Arginusse. whyche is in the mayne lande directly agaynste Mytilene. And after that they had supped, they saylled moste parte of the nyghte so longe that aboutes none they arryued at Hamatus, whiche is a towne in the mayne lande foranempst Methymna, where they soubdainlye dyned. Sithens after dynner passynge foranemste Lecte,Lectus. Larisse,Larissa.

The Athenyans, that were at Seste, to the nomber of, xviii, shyppes, seynge the signes and tokens of their watches, whyche were made by fyers, and also lykewyse a greate nomber of othere fyers that were made alongeste the sea coaste: knewe that the Peloponesians were entred into the goulphe of Hellesponte. And so embarqued theymselfe incontinently, and the selfe nyghte dyd comme byneth Cheronese, for to aboorde in Eleunte, thynkynge by that meane to auoyde and exchue the armye of ennemyes by the mayne sea, and for effecte they dydde passe so diligently, that the, xvi, shyppes, whiche were in Abyde, parceyued them not, althoughe that they were aduertised by the Peloponesians, that they shoulde take good hede or watche welle, that the Athenyans shyps shulde not passe wythoute their knowlaige. But after that the breake of the daye appered, they dyd sone see the shyps of Myndarus. So they incontinently fledde, but they did not all take the mayn sea, for one partie retyredde into the mayne lande, and some other to Lenmus,Lēmus there were foore of theym that remayned the laste, whyche were takene nyghe to Eleunte, with the people, that were within them, for they came to crosse a thwarte theyme foranempste the chapelle of Protesilaus, twoo were takene emptye or voyde, whereof the people was saued, and one was burned, whiche hadde bene lykewyse takene emptye. And that done, hauynge assembled the same day aswell of Abyde as of other places, the nomber of foore skoore and syxe shyps, they dyd comme straight to Eleunte, thynkynge to take it by force, but seynge that there was noo hope therin, they sailled to Abyde. In this meane time the Athenians, thynkyng that the armye by sea, of the ennemyes, coulde not passe, but that they shoulde knowe yt, they were styll bifore Erese, and made there preparations for to assaulte the walle.

               ¶Howe the Athenians hadde a victorye agaynste the Peloponesians in the sea of Hellesponte. ☞The .xv. Chapter.
               THe armye of the Athenyans was locked at both poynctes and extended from of the coaste of Ses
                     •
                  e towardes the mayne lande. On the other syde that same of the Peloponesians, perceyuynge the other to come forwardes, departed from Abyde, for to encounter it. And whā both parties did see, that it was nedefull to fight, they extended themself into the sea, to wytt, the Lacedemonyans, who had, xlviii, shypps, enlarged themself frō Abyde to Dardane, in the ryght poyncte whereof were the Syracusayns, and Myndarus helde the lefte, wherin the lightest shyps were. The Athenyans extended themself towardes Cheronese: frō Idaque to Archiane, whiche were in al foore skoore and sixtene shyps, in the left poyncte whereof was Thrasyllus, and Thrasybulus in the ryght, and the other capytaynes, euery one in the place, that was appoyncted for hym. So the Peloponesians auaunced theymself to fyghte and furst to geue the assault, to the ende to haue enclosed with their left poyncte, the ryght poynct of the Athenians, if they myght, in suche sorte, that they shulde not haue bene hable to enlarge theymselfe in the sea, and that the other shyppes, whyche were in the myddeste shoulde be constrayned to retyre to the lande, whiche was not verye farre of. Whereupon the Athenyans, perceyuynge frome the coaste that the ennemyes woulde comme to enclose them, they assaulted theyme lyuely, and hauynge takene their charge of the sea, they saylled and gouernedde their shyppes more galiardly: than the othere. On the otheresyde, their leafte poyncte had bene passed already the rockye place, whyche is called, the sepulchre of the dogge,The sepulcre of the dog. by meane whereof the shyppes, that were in the myddeste of their battaylle, remayned nakedde and disseparated frome those of the two poynctes, somuche in the greater danger, that the ennemyes hadde the more nombere of shypps, and farre better fournysshed wyth men. And moreouer that same rockye place of the sepulchre of the dogge, extendeth alongest into the sea of suche sorte, that those that were wythin the goulphe and retreatte therof, coulde see nothing of that whyche was done wythoute. For thys cause the Peloponesians, seynge those same, separated and feobled in suche sorte, came to geue charge vpon theyme and repoulsed theyme vnto the lande, and those same Peloponesians, seynge theymeselfe to haue the vyctorye, a greate nomber of theyme landed for to followe the Athenyans, whyche coulde not be succouredde by their people, to wytte, by those, that were in the ryght poyncte wyth Thrasibulus, for that they were oppressed wyth greater nomber of shyppes, than they had. Nothere wyth those, whyche were in the left poynct wyth Thrasillus, for that, that they coulde not see what those same dyd there, by cause of the rockye place or promontorye that was bitwene both, and moreouer they hadde muche to do for to resiste the shyps of the Syracusains and a greate nomber of other, whyche oppressed them greatly, vntill that the Peloponesians, perceiuing themself to haue the victorye, bigonne to putt themself into disorder for to followe the ennemyes shipps, so as they skattered themself abroade. For Thrasybulus, which perceiued it, wythout more contending to saille with those, that were bifore him: russhed wyth all his ships and with all his strength vpon them, so that he put them to flight. And fyndynge those, whiche had brokene the myddeste of hys battaylle into disorder, he brought them in such feare, that many of them without tarying did put themself

into flyght. Whiche parceyued, the Siracusains, and the othere that were wyth them, whyche had bene already greatlye oppressed by Thrasillus, dyd lykewyse putt themselfe in flighte: in suche sorte, that all the armye of the Peloponesians fledde straight towardes the ryuer of Pydia, and fromethence towardes Abyde. And albeit that the Athenyans dyd not take a greate nomber of the ennemyes shippes: yet that same vyctorie dyd come very wel to their purpose: for that, that they were bifore tyme in greate feare of the Peloponesians by sea, by cause of many losses, whiche they had made in many places wyth them: but aboue all, for the same of Sicille. Wherby, after the victorie, the feare cessed, whiche they had of the said Peloponesyans by sea, and also the murmuration that was amongest their people, by cause of the same. And neuerthelas they dyd take of the enemys ships those, whyche dyd followe eyghte of Chio, fyue of the Corynthians, two of the Ambraciotes and twoo of the Beotians: and of the Leucadians, Lacedemonyans, Siracusains and Pellyens of euery of them, one: & they loste fyften of theirs. So they receyued after the battaille the shipwrackes and the cariongns. Where of they dyd by appoynctement render to the ennemyes, theirs: and afterwardes, hauynge addressed and reysed their Trophee vpon the rocky place of the sepulcre of the dogge, they dyspesched a brygantyne, by the whyche they aduertysed the Athenyans of that same vyctorie. Through the which newes, the Cytezeins that were in muche greate feare and dyspayre by cause of the greate inconueniences, that were happened vnto them, aswell in Eubea, as in the cytie it self, throughe their seditions: recouered theire spirittes, and dyd greatelye take agayne theire courage, hopynge to be yett hable to haue the vyctorie agaynste their ennemys, if there case were well and diligently conducted. Foore dayes after the same vyctorie, hauinge in thys meane tyme, wyth greate diligence repaired their shippes, whych were brused and crusshed at Seste, they departed fromthence for to saille to recouer the cytie of Cizice,Sicum. whiche were rebelled frome theym. And in passynge their voiage, they dyd see eyght Peloponesyans shyps in the hauon of Harpagie and of Priape,

                     Priapus.
                   whiche were departed from Bizance: the whyche they assaulted, vaynquished and toke. And fromthence they sailled to Cizice, and also did take it easely for that, that it had no walles, and they recouered of the burgeoses a good somme of monney. Duringe thys tyme the Peloponesyans departed out frome Abyde, and sailled to Eleunte. Where they dyd take of the shyppes, whyche had bene gaigned and wonne of the ennemyes those thereof, that they founde whole and entier: for they of the towne had burned a greate nomber of them. And also sente Hippocrates and Epicles into Eubea for to brynge awaye other of theym.Hippocrates. In the self seasone Alcibiades departed out of Cannus & of Phaselide wyth .xiiii. shipps, to Samie: and did the Athenyans that were there to vnderstande, howe he had empesched that the Phenycians shippes did not come to the ayde of the Peloponesians, and also had drawin and treyned Tyssaphernes to the benyuolence of the Athenyans, muche more than bi
                     •
                  oretyme he had bene. Sithens hauynge with hys eyght shyppes tacled other nyne that he founde there, he sailled into Halicarnassus: where he leuied a greate some of monney, and so enclosed the towne wyth wal. Afterwardes he did retourne to Samie about the begynninge of Autumpne. On the other syde, Tissaphernes, hauinge vnderstanded, howe the armye by sea of the Peloponesyans was departed from Mylet for to passe into Hellesponce, departed from Aspende for to saille into Ionum. And in the meane tyme that the Peloponesyans were occupyed in the affayres of Hellesponte, the Citezeins of Antandrie (which is a towne of the Eoliens) hauing takene a certen nomber of people in Abyde, caused them by nyght to passe through the mounte

of Ida.Antandrii So they put them into the towne and dyd chase fromthence the men of Arsacus the Persyen,Arsacus who was capytayne there for Tissaphernes, for that, that he intreated them noughtelye. And besides the euill intreatinge, they had greate feare of him and of his crueltie for the experyence, whyche they hadde sene hym vse agaynste the Delyens. Who, whan they were chased out of the Isle of Delos by the Athenyans, vnder couloure of relygione, they beinge wythdrawin into a towne nyghe vnto Antandria, named Atramyrtum:Atramyrtū. that same Arsacus, whiche dyd beare them certen hatred, dissimuled or cloked hys euill wyll, and faigned wt the pryncipalles of them that he wolde vse their saruyce in warre, and geue thē wages, and by that meane caused them all to yssue fourth into the feldes. And one day, as they were at dynner caused them to be bisett rounde aboutes by his men and wyth stroakes of dartes to be slayne righte cruellye. For this reasons than and for not beynge of power to supporte the charges that were exacted of them, the Antandryans chased away his men. Wherby Tyssaphernes found him self greatly offended, besyde that, whyche had already bene done by the Peloposyans at Mylet and at Cnydus: from whence they had lykewise chased hys men. And fearyng leaste it shulde happen worse, and also hauing in great despyte, that Pharnabazus, hauinge wythdrawin them to wages shuld with their ayde, doo wyth lesser charges and in lesser tyme, more in effecte than he could do wyth the Athenyans, he determyned to saille vnto thē into Hellesponte for to complayne to them of the sayde oultrages that had bene done to hym, and also for to excuse and discharge hymself of that, wherewyth men charged hym, specyally touchinge the Phenycians shippes. So he toke hys iourney, and beinge arryued at Ephesus,Ephesus. he made hys sacrefice in the temple of Diana. And whan the wynter that shall comme after thys sommer shalbe fynishedde, yt shalbe the ende of the twentye and one yeare of thys same warre.
