                  My maner is to muſe and to deuyſe

                  Is gyuen vnder ſuch haboundant faſhyon

                  For what more ryght to graunt when loue loue requireth
                  Then loue for loue, when loue nought els deſyreth

                  Of all paynes the moſte incomparable payne
                  Is to be a louer not louyd agayne.
               
            
            The woman belouyd not louyng entreth.
            
               Belouyd not louyng.

                  Hearyng and anſweryng me pacyently
                  I doubt not by the ſame incontynently
                  your ſelfe to ſee by wordes that ſhall enſue
                  The contrary of your wordes veryfyed for true.
               
            
            
               Louer not loued
               Fayre lady pleaſyth it you to repayrenere
               And in this cauſe to ſhewe cauſe reaſonable
               wherby cauſe of reformacyon may appere
               Of reaſon I muſte and wylbe reformable
            
            
               Louyd not louyng
               well ſyns ye pretende to be confyrmable
               To reaſon, in auoydyng circumſtaunce
               Brefely by reaſon I ſhall the truthe auaunce.
               
                  
ye be a louer no whyt louyd agayne
               And I am louyd of whom I loue nothyng
               Then ſtandyth our queſtion betwene theſe twayne
               Of louyng not louyd, or louyd not louyng
               which is the caſe moſte paynfull in ſufferyng
               wherto I ſaye that the moſte payne doth moue
               To thoſe belouyd of whome they can not loue
            
            
               Louer not louyd.
               
                  Thoſe wordes approued lo, myght make a chaunge
                  Of myne opinion / but verely
                  The caſe as ye put it I thynke more ſtraunge
                  Then true, for though the belouyd party
                  Can not loue agayne, yet poſſybly
                  Can I not thynke, nor I thynke neuer ſhall
                  That to be louyd can be any payne at all.
               
            
            
               Belouyd not louyng.
               
                  That reaſon perceyuyd and receyuyd for trouth
                  From proper comparyſon ſholde clere confounde me
                  Betwene payne & no payne, no ſuch comparyſon growth
                  Then or I can on comparyſon grounde me
                  To proue my caſe paynefull ye haue fyrſt bounde me
                  To which ſyns ye dryue me by your denyall
                  Marke what enſueth before ferther tryall.
               
               
                  I ſaye I am louyd of a certayne man
                  whom for no ſewt I can fauour agayne
                  And that haue I tolde hym ſyns his ſewt began
                  A thouſand tymes but euery tyme in vayne
                  For neuer ſeaſeth his tonge to complayne
                  And euer one tale whiche I neuer can flee
                  For euer in maner where I am is he.
               
               Nowe if you to here one thyng euery where
               Contrary to your appetyte ſholde be led
               were it but a mouſe lo ſholde pepe in your ere
               Or alway to harpe on a cruſt of bred
               Howe coulde you lyke ſuch harpyng at your hed
            
            
               Louyng not louyd.
               Somewhat dyſpleaſaunt it were I not deny
            
            
               Louyd not louyng.
               Then ſomewhat payneful as well ſeyd ſay I
               
                  Dyſpleaſure and payne be thynges ioyntly anex

                  For as it is dyſpleaſaunt in payne to be
                  So it is paynefull in dyſpleaſure to be vext
                  Thus by dyſpleaſure in payne ye confes me
                  wherby ſyns ye part of my payne do ſee
                  In my ferther payne I ſhall nowe declare
                  
                     That payne by whyche with your payne I compare.
               
               
                  Smale were the quantyte of my paynfull ſmerte

                  By whyche I haue ſpent ſo many and ſuche terys
                  That were they all red as they be all whyte
                  The blood of my harte had be gone or thys quyte
               
               
                  And almoſte in caſe as though it were gone
                  Am I except hys ſewt take end ſhortely
                  For it doth lyke me euyn lyke as one
                  Shold offer me ſeruyce moſt humbly

                  I alledge for generall thys one ſymylytude
                  Auoydyng reherſale of paynes partyculer

                  By whyche enſaumple yf ye conſydere
                  Ryghtly my caſe at leſt wyſe ye may ſee
                  My payne as paynfull as your payne can bee.
               
               
                  And yet for ſhorter end put caſe that your payne
                  were oft tymes more ſharpe and ſore in degre
                  Then myne ys at any tyme yet wyll I proue playne

                  Kepyth moſte tymes poſſeſſyon of ſome delyght
                  Thus haue you oft tymes ſome way eaſe of payne

                     Out of payne, me thynke this conſequent
                  That my payne may well by meane of the length
                  Compare with your ſhorter payne of more ſtrength

                  Mayſtres if your long payne be no ſtronger

                  I am content to agree for a ſeaſon
                  To graunt and enlarge your latter reaſon
               
               
                  Amytte by her preſens halfe my tyme pleaſaunt
                  And all your tyme as paynefull as in caſe can be
                  yet your payne to be moſt, reaſon wyl not graunt
                  And for enſample I put caſe that ye

                  And I halfe the ſame day to myd leg in the fyer

                  One pang of one worde of her mouth as in yre
                  Or in reſtraynt of her loue which I requyre
                  One pang of all theſe felt ones in all your lyfe
                  Sholde quayle your opinyon and quench all our ſtryfe

                  Much are we louers then to be commendyd
                  For loue his apparence dyſſembleth in no wyſe

                  who fayne in apparence are loues mortall enmyes

To my ſelfe I laughed euyn hartely
               with my ſelfe conſyderyng to haue had lyke ſpede
               If my ſelfe had ben a louer in dede.
               But nowe to make ſom matter wherby
               I may take my leue of my loue honeſtly
               Swete hart quoth I ye take to much vpon ye
               No more then becomes me knowe thou well quoth ſhe
               But thou haſt takyn to much vpon the
               In takyng that thou toke in hande to mock me
               wherin from begynnyng I haue ſene the iet
               Lyke as a foole myght haue iettyd in a net
               Beleuyng hymſelfe ſaue of hym ſelfe onely
               To be perceyued of no lyuyng body
               But well ſaw I thyne entent at begynnyng
               was to beſtow a mock on me at endyng
               when thou laughedeſt dyſſymulyng a wepyng hare
               Then I with wepyng eyes played euyn the lyke part
               wherwith I brought in moccum moccabitur
               And yet thou beyng a long ſnowted cur
               Coulde no whyt ſmell that all my meanyng was
               To gyue mock for mock as now is come to pas
               which now thus paſſed if thy wyt be handſome
               May defende the from mockes in tyme to come
               By clappyng faſt to thy ſnowt euery day

               But thynke my ſelfe or any man elles a foole
               In mockes or wyles to ſet women to ſcoole
               But nowe to purpoſe wherfore I began
               All though I were made a fole by this woman
               Concernyng mockyng yet doth this tale approue
               That I am well ſene in the arte of loue
               For I entendyng no loue but to mock
               yet coulde no louer of all the hole flock
               Ctrcumſtaunce of loue dyſcloſe more nor better
               Then dyd I the ſubſtaunce beyng no greater
               And by this tale afore ye all may ſee
               All though a louer as well loued be
               As loue can deuyſe hym for pleaſaunt ſpede
               yet two dyſpleaſures telouſy and drede

               To gyue babes for wormes for it drynkth bytter ſwete
               And as for this babe our louer in whoſe hed
               By a frantyk worme his opinion is bred
               After one draught of this medſyn mynyſtryd
               
                  In to his brayne by my brayne apoyntyd
               Reaſon ſhall ſo temper his opinion
               That he ſhall ſee it not worth an onyon
               And if he haue any other thyng to ley
               I haue to conuynſe hym euery way
               And ſyns my parte nowe doth thus well appere
               Be ye my parteners now all of good chere
               But ſylence euery man vpon a payne

               Though two tales at ones by two eares hard may be

               Syrs other here is a very weyke brayne
               Or ſhe hath if any a very weyke payne
               For I put caſe that my loue I her gaue
               And that for my loue, her loue I dyd craue
               For which though I dayly ſew day by day
               what loſſe or payne to her if ſhe ſay nay
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               yes by ſaynt Mary ſo the caſe may ſtande
               That ſome woman had leuer take in hande
               To ryde on your errand on hundreth myle

               If ye on her parte any payne defyne
               which is the more paynefull her payne or myne
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               your payne is moſt if ſhe ſay nay and take it
               But if that ſhe ſay nay and forſake it
               Then is her payne a great way the greater
            
            
               Loued not louyng.
               Syr ye alledge this nay in this mater
               As though my denyal my ſewter to loue

               wherin the treuth is a contrary playne
               For though to ofte ſpekyng one thyng be a payne
               yet is that one worde the full of my hopyng
               To bryng his hopyng to dyſpayre at endyng
               Thus is this nay which ye take my moſt grefe
               Though it be paynefull yet my moſt relefe
               But my moſt payne is all an other thyng
               which though ye forget or hyde by dyſſymylyng
               I partely ſhewed you, but all I coulde nor can
               But mayſters to you with payne of this man
               
                  
That payne that I compare is partely this
               I am loued of one whome the treuth is
               I can not loue, and ſo it is with me
               That from hym in maner I neuer can

               Nyps through myne eares and rons through my harte
               His gaſtfull loke ſo pale that vnneth I
               Dare for myne eares caſt towarde hym an eye
               And whan I do that eye my thought preſentyth
               Streyght to my hart and thus my payne augmentyth
               One tale ſo ofte alas and ſo importune

               Some tyme on hymſelfe ſome tyme vpon me

               Louer not loued.
               This tale to purpoſe purporteth no more
               But ſyght and hearyng complaynt of his ſore
               Is onely the grefe that ye do ſuſteyne
               Alas tender hart ſyns ye dye in payne

               By the maſſe it is ſo playne
            
            
               Louer not loued.
               well ſayd for me, for I am the ſufferer
               And ye the hangman vnderſtande as it were
               Theſe caſes vary in no maner a thyng

               In this lo your caſe from our caſe doth vary

               To extynct, may be your owne pheſicion
               Except ye be a foole or wolde make me one

               Mayſtres much parte of this proces purpoſed
               Is matter of truth truely dyſcloſed
               My wyll without her wyll brought me in loue
               which wyll without her wyll doth make me houe
               Vpon her grace to ſee what grace wyll proue
               But where ye ſay my wyll may me remoue
               As wel from her loue, as wyll brought me to it
               That is falſe my wyll can not wyll to do it
               My wyl as farre therin out weyth my power
               As a ſow of led out weyth a ſaforne flowre

               your wyl out weyth your power thē where is your wyt
               I merueyll that euer ye wyll ſpeke it

               Nay merueyll ye mayſtres therat no whyt
               For as farre as this poynt may ſtretch in verdyt
               I am clerely of this mans opinion
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               And I contrary with this mynion
            
            
               Louer loued.
               Then be we come to a demurrer in lawe
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               Then be ye come from a woodcock to a daw

               Nay mayſters I hartely pray you both
               Banyſhe contencyon tyll ye ſee howe this goth
               I wyll repet and anſwere her tale forth with
               The pyth for your part wherof pretendyth
               A profe for your payne to be more then myne
               In that my wyll not onely dyd me enclyne
               To the ſame, but in the ſame by the ſame wyll

               As great as yours that I ſholde ſuerly bere
               As great and good wyll to flee my loue thus ment
               As do ye your ſewters preſens to abſent

               This tale ſheweth my tale perſeyued euery dell
            
            
               Louer not loued.
               Then for entre to anſwere it as well
               Anſwere this put caſe ye as depely nowe▪
               
               
                  Dyd loue your louer as he doth loue yow

               yes

               Loue hym nay as I ſayd muſt I ſtreyght choſe

               For my parte wherof nowe thus begyn I
               I am as I ſayd a beloued louer
               And he no louer nor beloued nother
               In which two caſes he maketh his auaunt
               Of both our partes to proue his moſt pleaſaunt
               But be ye aſſuered by ought I yet ſe
               In his eſtate no maner pleaſure can be
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               yes two maner pleaſures ye muſt nedes confe

               Fyrſt I haue the pleaſure of quyetnes
               And the ſecounde is I am contented
            
            
               Louer loued.
               That ſeconde pleaſure now ſecondly inuented
               To compare with pleaſure by contentaſhyon
               Is a very ſeconde ymagynaſhyon
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               Then ſhewe your wyt for profe of this in hande
            
            
               Louer loued.
               Pleaſure without contentacyon can not be
               But contentacyon without pleaſure we ſe
               In thynges innumerable euery day
               Of all which marke theſe which I ſhall nowe ley
               Put caſe that I for pleaſure of ſome frende
               Or ſome thyng which I longed to ſe at ende
               wolde be content to ryde thre ſcore myle this nyght
               And neuer wolde bayte nor neuer alyght
               I myght be ryght well content to do this
               And yet in this doyng no pleaſure there is
               Moreouer ye by pacyent ſufferaunce
               May be contented with any myſchaunce
               The loſſe of your chylde frende or any thyng
               That in this worlde to you can be longyng
               wherin ye contented neuer ſo well
               yet is your contentacyon pleaſure no dell
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               Theſe two exſamples by ought that I ſe
               Be no thyng the thynges that any thynge touch me
               with deth of my chylde my beyng contented
               Or payne with my frende wyllyngly aſſented
               Is not contentacyon voluntary
               For that contentacyon cometh forceably
               
                  But my contentacion ſtandeth in ſuch thyng
               As I wolde fyrſt wyſhe if it went by wyſhyng
            
            
               Louer loued.
               Syr be ye contented euen as ye tell
               yet your contentacyon can nother excell
               Nor be compared egall to myne eſtate
               For touchyng contentacyon I am in rate
               As hyely contented to loue as ye ſe
               As ye to forbere loue can wyſhe to be
               Had I no more to ſay in this argument
               But that I am as well as you content
               yet hath my parte nowe good approbacyon
               To match with yours euen by contentacyon
               But contentacion is not all the thyng
               That I for my loue haue in recompencyng
               Aboue contentacyon pleaſures felyng
               Haue I ſo many, that no wyght lyuyng
               Can by any wyt or tonge the ſame reporte
               O the pleaſaunt pleaſures in our reſorte
               After my beyng from her any whyther
               what pleaſures haue we in commyng to gyther
               Eche tap on the grounde towarde me with her fote
               Doth bathe in delyght my very harte rote
               Euery twynke of her aluryng eye
               Reuyueth my ſpirites euen thorowoutly
               Eche worde of her mouth not a preparatyue
               But the ryght medicyne of preſeruatyue
               we be ſo ioconde and ioyfully ioyned
               Her loue for my loue ſo currantly coyned
               That all pleaſures yerthly the treuth to declare
               Are pleaſures not able with ours to compare
               This mouth in maner receyueth no food
               Loue is the fedyng that doth this body good
               And this hed dyſpyſeth all theſe eyes wynkyng
               Longer then loue doth kepe this harte thynkyng
               To dreame on my ſwete harte, loue is my feader
               Loue is my lorde, and loue is my leader
               Of all myne affayres in thought, worde, and dede,
               Loue is the Chriſts croſſe that muſt be my ſpede
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               By this I perceyue wel ye make rekenyng
               That loue is a goodly and a good thyng
            
            
               Louer loued.
               Loue good what yll in loue canſt thou make apere
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               yes I ſhal proue this loue at this tyme ment here
               In this mans caſe as yll as is the deuyll
               And in your caſe I ſhall proue loue more euyll
               what tormentry coulde all the deuylles in hell
               Deuyſe to his payne that he doth not tell
               
                  
what payne bryngeth that body thoſe deuyls in that hed
               which myny ſters alway by loue are led
               He fryſyth in fyre he drowneth in drought
               Eche parte of his body loue hath brought abought
               where eche to helpe other ſhulde be dylygent
               They marter eche other the man to torment
               without ſtynt of rage his paynes be ſo ſore
               That no fende may torment man in hell more
               And as in your caſe to proue that loue is
               wurs than the deuyll my meanyng is this
               Loue dyſtempereth hym by torment in payne
               And loue dyſtempereth you as farre in ioy playne
               your owne confeſſion declareth that ye
               Eate, drynke, or ſlepe euyn as lyttell as he
               And he that lacketh any one of thoſe three
               Be it by ioy or by payne clere ye ſee
               Deth muſt be ſequell howe euer it be
               And thus are ye both brought by loues induccyon
               By payne or by ioy to lyke poynt of dyſtruccyon
               which poynt aproueth loue in this caſe paſt
               Beyonde the deuyll in turmentry to haue a caſt
               For I trowe ye fynde not that the deuyll can fynde
               To turment man in hell by any pleaſaunt mynde
               wherby as I ſayd I ſay of loue ſtyll
               Of the deayll and loue, loue is the more yll
               And at begynnyng I may ſay to yow
               If god had ſene as much as I ſay now
               Loue had ben Lucyfer and doubt ye no whyt
               But experyens nowe hath taught god ſuch wyt
               That if ought come at Lucyfer other then good
               To whyp ſoules on the brech loue ſhalbe the blood
               And ſewer he is one that can not lyue long
               For aged folke ye wot well can not be ſtrong
               And an other thyng his phiſicyou doth ges
               That he is infecte with the blak iawndes
            
            
               Louer loued.
               No ferther then ye be enfecte with folye
               For in all theſe wordes no worde can I eſpye
               Such as for your parte any profe auoucheth
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               For profe of my parte, no but it toucheth
               The dyſprofe of yours for where you alledged
               your parte aboue myne to be compared
               By pleaſures in which your dyſpleaſures are ſuch
               That ye eate, drynke, nor ſlepe, or at moſt not much
               In lacke wherof my tale proueth playnly
               Eche parte of your pleaſure a turmentry
               wherby your good loue I haue proued ſo euyll
               
                  That loue is apparauntly wors then the deuyll
               And as touchyng my parte there can aryſe
               No maner dyſpleaſures nor tormentryes
               In that I loue not, nor am not loued
               I moue no dyſpleaſures nor none to me moued
               But all dyſpleaſures of loue fro me abſent
               By abſens wherof I quyetly content
            
            
               Louer loued.
               Syr where ye ſayd and thynke ye haue ſayd wel
               That my ioy
                     •
                   by loue ſhall bryng deth in ſequell
               In that by the ſame in maner I dyſdayne
               Fode and ſlepe, this prouerbe anſwereth you playne
               Loke not on the meat, but loke on the man
               Nowe loke ye on me and ſay what ye can
            
            
               No louer nor loued
               Nay for a tyme loue may puffe vp a thynge
               But lackyng fode and ſlepe deth is the endyng
            
            
               Louer loued
               well ſyr tyll ſuch tyme as deth approue it
               This part of your tale may ſlepe euery whyt
               And where ye by abſent dyſpleaſure wolde
               Match with my preſent pleaſure ye ſeme more bolde
               Then wyſe, for thoſe twayne be farre dyfferent ſewer
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               Is not abſens of dyſpleaſure a pleaſure
            
            
               Louer loued.
               yes in lyke rate as a poſt is pleaſed
               which as by no meane it can be dyſeaſed
               By dyſpleaſure preſent ſo is it trew

               A poſt ye knowe well can not fele poſſybly
               And as a poſt in this caſe I take you

               when the hors muſt to labour by our lady

               The firſt caſe is yours and the next is for me
               In caſe lyke a tree I may liken ye
               For as a tree hath lyfe within feling
               
                  wherby it felith pleaſing not diſpleaſing
               And can not be but contented quietly
               Euen the like caſe is yours now preſently
               And as the hors feleth paine and not the tree
               Lyke wyſe I haue paine and no paine haue ye
               And as a hors aboue a tree felyth pleaſure
               So fele I pleaſure aboue you in rate ſure
               And as the tre felith nother and the hors both

               For indifferent ende I thinke this way beſt
               Of all our reaſoning to debarre the reſt
               And in theſe two caſes this one queſtion
               To be the iſſue that we ſhal ioyne on

               Contented with that and by ought I eſpy
               we may in this mater take ende quickly
               Stan we theyr caſes as ſhe did apply them
               That we may perceiue what is ment by them
               He loueth vnloued a goodly one
               She is loued not louinge of an vgly one
               Or in his eye his louer ſemeth goodly
               And in her eye her lober ſemeth as vgly
               Her moſt deſyred angels face he can not ſee
               His moſt lothely hell houndes face ſhe can not flee
               He loueth, ſhe abhorreth wherby preſens is
               His life, her deth▪ wherby I ſay euen this
               Be his feling paines in euery degre
               As great and as many as he ſayth they be

               When mater at full is indifferently leyd

               what reaſon the tyme by me ſhulde be deleyd
               ye haue ſpoken my thought wherfore to you

               Well ſins your conſcyens driueth you thus to iudge
               I receiue this iudgement without grefe or grudge
            
            
               Loued not louing.
               And I in like rate, yelding vnto you twaine
               Harty thankes for this your vndeſeruid paine
            
            
               Louer not loued.
               Nowe maiſters may it pleaſe you to declare
               As touching their partes of what minde ye are
            
            
               Loued not louinge.
               
                  With right good will ſir, and ſure I ſuppoſe
                  Their partes in fewe wordes mate come to pointe well
                  The two examples which he did diſcloſe
                  All errours or doubtes do clerly expell
                  The eſtate of a tre his eſtate doth tell
                  And of the hors his tale wel vnderſtande
                  Declareth as well his caſe nowe in hande
               
               
                  For as nothing can pleaſe or diſpleaſe a tre
                  By ani pleaſure or diſpleaſue feling
                  Nor neuer bring a tre diſcontent to be
                  So like caſe to him not loued nor louing
                  Loue can no way bring pleaſing or diſpleaſing

                     orneis
                  A louer beſt loued hath paines in like wiſe
                  As here hath apered by ſondry weys
                  which ſheweth his caſe in wurſt part to riſe
                  But then as the horſe feleth pleaſure in ſiſe
                  At night in the ſtable aboue the tre
                  So feleth he ſome pleaſure as farre aboue ye

               Betwene the more and the leſſe it ſemeth to me
               That betwene their pleaſures no choiſe is to geſſe
               Wherfore I giue iudgement in ſhort proceſſe
               Set the tone pleaſure euiu to the tother

               Womanly ſpoken maiſtres by the roodes mother
            
            
               Louer not loued.
               Who heareth this tale wyth in different minde
               
                  And ſeeth of theſe twaine eche one ſo full bent
               To his owne parte that nother in harte can finde
               To chaunge pleaſures with other muſt nedes aſſent
               That ſhe in theſe wordes hath gyuen ryght iudgement
               In affirmance wherof I iudge and awarde
               Both theſe pleaſures of yours as one in regarde
            
            
               Louer loued.
               wel ſyns I thinke ye both without corrupcion
               I ſhall moue no mater of interrupcion
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               Nor I but mayſters though I ſay nought in this
               May I not thinke my pleaſure more than his
            
            
               Loued not louing.
               Affeccion vnbridled may make vs al thynke
               That eche of vs hath done other wronge
               But where reaſon taketh place it can not ſinke
               Syns cauſe to be percial here is none vs amonge
               That one hed that wolde thinke his owne wit ſo ſtrong
               That on his iudges he myght iudgement deuiſe
               what iudge in ſo iudging coulde iudge hym wyſe
            
            
               Louer loued.
               well myne eſtate ryght wel contenteth me
            
            
               No louer nor loued.
               And I with myne as well content as ye
            
            
               Louer not loued.
               
                  So ſhulde ye both likewiſe be contented
                  Eche other to ſee content in ſuch degree
                  As on your partes our iugement hath awarded
                  your neyghbour in pleaſure lyke your ſelfe to be
                  Gladly to wiſhe Chriſtes precept doth byndeye
                  Thus contentacion ſhulde alway prefer
                  One man to ioy the pleaſure of an other

                  True and contencion may be in like caſe
                  All though no helth yet helpe and greate relefe
                  In both your paynes for ye hauing ſuch grace
                  To be contented in ſufferaunce of grefe
                  Shall by contentacion auoide much myſchiefe

                  Payne to paine as paineful as your paine is nowe
               
               
                  Thus not we foure but al the worlde beſide
                  Knowledge them ſelfe or other in ioy or payne
                  Hath nede of contentacion for a gyde
                  Hauinge ioy or payne content let vs remayne
                  In ioy or payne of other flee we diſdaine

                  Syns ſuch contencion may hardly acorde
                  
                     In ſuch kynde of loue as here hath ben ment
