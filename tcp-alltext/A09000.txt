            HISTORIOLA, A litle storne of the actes and life of Mathew now / Archbishoppe of Canterb.
            
               NOwe sithens we haue declared many thinges which we thought specially worthye of rehersall concerning thestate off corpus Christi coll. and the actes of certaine masters therof▪ it remaineth that we drawe out the narratiō a litle longer for the fore said Mathew Parker his sake of whom we haue hitherto spoken those things which he onely did for the amplyfying and commoditie off the said colledge off the which he was mayster. But his praise was not shut vppe onely wythin those walls / but he being called from thence to other functions in the cōmon wealthe / at the last did beare the highest office of the Ecclesiasticall ministerie. for he was the archbischoppe of Canterburye Therfore in his hystorie (because his fame was more renowmed then any of the maysters of whom we haue made

mention) we will staye a litle longer / and repeate the course of his life euen from his cradell. He was borne in that famous citie of theaft Angles which ys called Norwitche in the yeere of the incarnatiō of our lorde a thowsand fyue hundreth foure / the sixt daye of the moneth of August / of honest parēts citezens / his father called williā / and his mother Alice / who caused his childhode to be instructed in thelements of grammer (as the coustome was then in the citye to frame the witts of children) within their owne house till he was xviij. yeeres olde. At wihich tyme being Past his Childhode / his mother riddeth him of her house / his father being dead / and sent him to Cambridge / to thentent that the foundation of learning beinge already laid by the knowledge of grammer / he might finishe the rest of the building in lerning the arts. Therfore in corpus Christi coll. he was sustained at the first / wholly by his mothers charges / of the which after a fewe monethes she being eased / he was chosen into the number of those scollers which are called bibleclarkes of the especiall

excelled in dignitie and countenaunce / and so on one side off the hall a continuall rowe of mē followed to other tables / sett in order and seuered by a litle space betwene / through out the lenght off the hall. On his right hand sate onely some noble women and the honorable wiues off other men / leading frō euery side off his table a course and right line of woomen through owt the length off the hall altogither like and correspondent to that rowe off men wheroff we spake before The which order off placing was obserued in honor of the Queēes highnes / for that vnder hir being gouernor of the realme / the said Mathew obteined his place. And this first furnishing off tables thus ended / ther were others partly off the Arschhishops familie / partly off the coūtry ther about which strait way satte downe in their places which rose / in the same order as before.

Againe the three and twentith day off Iuly folowinge / was the day off assize and publik meetinges off the Iudges / and other off the prouince / ether to vnderstande / mens causes / or to punishe manifeste

offenders / as wee haue before declared the said hall was likewise replenished / only excepted / that the guests weare only gentlemen / and off the beste off the woomen being placed at very exquisite fare / within the inner parlors. But amongest thinges whiche happened / vnto him in his life worthi off memorye. I reioyce especially for this his felicitie / that wheras after Augustine the fyrste Archbishoppe / he was the seuentith / yet he was both the firste / and only man / that attayned vnto tharchbishoplike dignitie with out any blemishe or spott off olde wiues superstitions and vnprofytable cerimonies off the Romishe Pope. for as euery one off them entred firste herunto by buils / off approbation sent from the Pope: so he was consecrated nether with these / nor any other olde / and idell ceremonies off Aarons ornamētes / nether with gloues / nor sandales / nor sslippers / nor miter / nor pall / but more chastely and religioussly / according to the puritie off the gospelie / fowre bishoppes beinge appointed accordinge to a lawe made in that behalfe whyche placed

him in his chaire with so godly promisses protested by him / as it is meete shoulde of a gospellike pastor. And yet this his (that I may so tearme it) ioyfull and solempne daye he spent not negligentlye / but with garments cōly for a bishoppe with godly praiers / off thecclesiasticall ministers / and peopell / vnto whome a sermō was made by a learned religious and a professed bishoppe in diuinitie / chiefly to

The sermō ended when the companie presēte / had refreshed thēselues / by partakinge the spirituall bāquett: they make an ende with earneste praiers vnto god / that that functiō whiche was laide on him / by the clergie / migthe chiefly tende to the glory of god / to the saluation of Christian flocke / and the ioyfull testimonie off his owne conscience / by faithfull executinge of his office / when yt shall happen him to departe vnto his lorde / to whome he vowed hym selfe.

            The tree off this succession norished with the sape off the crabstocke whearon it was vnhappely graffed / not vnlike to the manner off conquerers / and tyrans / sought by all meanes to aduaunce / and enlarge this ther newlye wonne domination. For they deuoured vpp quite an Archbischoprike off wales and drowned it in the botomlesse sea off Canterbury. Somwhat they strained at the vnderbishoprikes / ther making a conscience to swallowe suche gnates / and therfore off ther great Good grace / were contente they should not vtterly lose their beinge / but remaine to encrease the number off ther subiectes. By which shamfull struglinge they obtained to sit vppon ther fellowe Archbishoppe off yorke / and to tread vppon the reste theire brother bishoppes in Englande.
            And hauinge thus preuayled in England and conquered (for so he termeth yt) yorke / whome he could neither beare superiore with pompey nor suffer aequal withe Caesar / 

For he plainly chalengeth a superioritie and fealtie off him. Then boasteth he what a motherlie estimation it reteyned with the churches in Scottland / euen then / when he knoweth no milke was to bee sucked from her / but poison.
            From Scotland he takes shippinge and popelike steppes ouer into Ireland / and thence ouer againe into fraunce / Gasconie / Normandie / Aquetaine / and ther (saieth he) it ouercame all the churches in Iurisdiction allso. Iff this bee to watch ouer one prouīce in a realme / like an Archbishope / and not rather aspiringlye / to affect a popedome ouer many realmes / iudge ye. It wilbe no aunswear / to saye that the kinge off England / beinge then soueraigne off Ireland / and fraunce in possession / might aswell apoint one Archbisshope ouer all those regions / as ouer Ingland / or on prouince therin. for iff the Archbishopes nose must bee so longe / and that he must haue suche elbowe Rome / then lett vs hear what the Pope / who is next aboue the Archbishope will saye. Surely / he will singe the very same songe for him selfe. The emperour

off Rome soueraigne ouer all thes partes off the worlde / made me generall Bishoppe aboue my bretherne.

To proue which auncientye off the one / and dignitie off the / other these many other like popishe presumptions / and presumptuous poperies / are the best / and onely argumentes. Which iff they wear all gleaned / or rather mowed by

handfulls / and seuered a part from that which is spoken directly and to the purpose / for thancientye off the poore Christian churche in England / ther wolde bee but a poore haruest off that mater / which is so gailie pretended / euen scarse enoughe to make a storie off two leaues.
            This title therfore of antiquitie of the whole bodye off the generall Christian church in this our English Lād is but a bare title / nothing lesse mēt / then to bee entreated of / but onely to make his waye therthoroughe to the extolling / and hoysing vp / euen vppō mēs shoulders / that particular mēber / or chapell of Canterburie. The which is more manifest in the solēpne legend which followeth off Idolatrous Archiflamines / the which were euery one all their life longe / so farre as man may iudge by that that is left of thē euē sitting in that throne professed Baalites / and sworne Rōanistes / except that onely most trueli gracious bishope / and blessed martyr / holy Cranmer / and this man that nowe occupieth the Rome. All I saie except these two were euen while they sat superstitious Archsacrificers / ād principall bread worshippers.
