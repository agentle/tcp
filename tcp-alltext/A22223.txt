               ❧ A Proclamation for preuention and restraint of the abuses and inconueniences, occasioned by dying with Logwood.
            
               
                  WHereas many good Lawes and Statutes haue beene heretofore made and established, prohibiting the Importation of a certaine false and deceitfull dying stuffe or wood, called Logwood or Blockewood, which sayde Statutes did not produce that good effect that thereby was intended (the seizing and taking of the sayde Wood being wholly neglected) for that no satisfaction or recompence was by the Law offered or allowed to such as employ their paines and endeauour in the discouery and seizure thereof; whereupon Wee for further preuention of the sayd deceipts, haue made seuerall Restraints by Our Letters Patents, Bookes of Rates, and otherwise, thereby to hinder the importation and abuse of the sayd wood; By which meanes, albeit great quantities of the sayd wood haue beene seized and burnt, yet the said wood is still priuily imported and disposed of, within this Our Kingdome, to the hurt and preiudice of Our Subiects: Wee, hauing taken these things into Our consideration, and out of Our Princely care, desiring to pursue Our former purpose in preuenting whatsoeuer might be hurtfull to Our Subiects, and on the contrary to giue them reliefe in things vsefull and necessary; And being informed that the importation and vse thereof for diuers sorts of course Stuffes, Linnen of all sorts, Caddoes, Ribband, Inckle, Tape, Cappes, Gloues, Hattes, Leather for poynts, Brushes, couers for Bookes, Saddles, Stooles and Chaires, and Threed of diuers sorts, with many other Haberdashery wares, that cannot conueniently be dyed or coloured without Logwood or Blockwood, by reason of the cheapnesse, and the glosse it giues to such meane commodities, farre better then any other Stuffe can doe, is most necessary and not preiudiciall to any of Our Subiects; haue thought meete to Licence the importation of some competent quantitie of the said wood, to be employed and vsed onely about such needfull vses as aforesaid; And withall to adde some further prouision for restraint of the immoderate importation of the said wood, tending to the abuse and deceipt of Our people: And therefore haue by Our Letters Patents vnder Our great Seale of England, giuen Licence to Our welbeloued Seruant and Subiect Sir Thomas Compton Knight, and his Assignes, as well to import into this Kingdome yeerely the quantitie of fiftie Tonnes of Logwood, and no more, as to take into his or their hands the moytie of all Logwood imported by others, and seized as forfeited, the other part thereof being first burnt; Neuerthelesse vnder these cautions and prouisions following, viz. That there shall not be vttered or sold by him or his Assignes, aboue the aforesaid yeerely quantity of fifty Tonnes of Logwood or Blockwood, and to none other vse or vses, then the good and necessary vses before mentioned; And that hee or they shall not directly or indirectly import any greater quantitie then fiftie Tonnes yeerely; And that the same, with all such Logwood as shall be seized and come to his or their hands, shall be registred in the Custome-house in London, in Our Register there kept for forfeitures, with the name of the Master of the Shippe, and owner of the wood,

to the ende that it may be knowen who shall presume to import the same, contrary to Our pleasure; And that as well the wood by him the sayd Sir Thomas Compton, his Executors or Assignes, to be imported, as otherwise to come to his or their hands vpon seizure, which shall be solde or vented within this Realme, shall bee ground and solde in an appointed place in the Citie of London, and not elsewhere; And that vpon such sale, the names and place of abode of all such as shall buy Logwood, shall be taken and registred, and for what vse they buy the same; And that so much of the said Logwood as shall come vnto the hands of the said Sir Thomas Compton or his Assignes, by importation or otherwise, as shall exceede the quantitie of fiftie Tonnes in any one yeere, shall be by him or them shipped foorth of this Kingdome, within three moneths after the same shall come to his or their hands or possession: And likewise that the said Sir Thomas Compton or his Assignes, shall at all times, being thereunto required, giue notice to whom the same Logwood is solde, that enquirie may be made, whether the buyer thereof doe vse the same contrary to the orders prescribed.
            And the better to encourage such as will employ their endeauour in and about the discouerie and seizure of the said wood, to the end the abuse thereof in dying Cloth and woollen commodities may be taken away, and the good vse thereof onely maintained and cherished, It is likewise prouided in the said Letters Patents, that the saide Sir Thomas Compton, his Executors and Assignes, shall pay to all such as shall seize any Logwood, the summe of sixe pounds per Tonne, and so by the hundreth accordingly, So that he that makes the seizure, doe first deliuer the one halfe of such wood to the Mayor, Bayliffe, or Iustice of Peace where it shall be seized, to be burnt, and then bring the other halfe to the Patentee, or his Assignes, with Certificate from some of the said Officers that the one halfe is burnt, As by Our said Letters Patents more at large appeareth: Wee, to the ende all Our louing Subiects may take notice of Our gracious purpose and intention, whereby the same may take better effect for the generall good of this Our Kingdome, Doe by this Our Proclamation publish and giue notice to all men, whom the premisses shall in any wise concerne, That Our expresse will and pleasure is, that all and euery the Cautions, Prouisions, Restraints, and other the premisses aboue-mentioned, be carefully and diligently performed and obserued.
            And therefore Wee doe hereby charge and command all Mayors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Iustices of Peace, Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Surueyours, Waiters, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other Our Officers and Ministers, not onely to be carefull and diligent in the discouering and punishing of all and singuler offences and offenders in this behalfe, but also to be from time to time aiding and assisting vnto the said Sir Thomas Compton, his Executors, Administrators and Assignes, and to his and their Deputie and Deputies, and to all other persons which shall finde and seize any of the sayd Logwood or Blockwood, imported, vsed, or employed contrary to this Our will and command.
            
               Giuen at Our Palace of White-hall, the nine and twentieth day of February, in the seuenteenth yeere of Our Reigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland.
               
God saue the King.
