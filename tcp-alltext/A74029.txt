                  WHERE THE KYNGES MOST excellent maieſtie is by gods law ſupreme heed immediatly vnder him of this hole churche and congregacion of England, intendinge the conſeruation of the ſame churche and congregacion in a true ſyncere and vniforme doctrine of Chriſtes religion, callyng alſo to his bleſſed and moſt gracious remembraunce, aſwel the great and quiet aſſurance, proſperous increace, and other innumerable commodities, whiche haue euer enſued come and folowed of Concord agreement and vnitie in opinions, as alſo the manyfolde peryls dangers and inconueniences, which haue heretofore in many places and regions, growen ſpronge and ar ryſen of the diuerſities of myndes and opinions, eſpecially of mattiers of Chriſten religion: And therfore deſyring, that ſuche an vnitie myght and ſhoulde be charitably eſtablyſſhed in all thinges, touchynge and concernynge the ſame, as the ſame ſo beynge eſtablyſſhed myghte chiefly be to the honoure of almyghtye God, the verye authoure and fountayne of all true vnitie and ſyncere concorde, and conſequentlye redounde to the common welth of this his hyghenes moſte noble realme, and of all his louinge ſubiectes, and other reſiauntes and inhabitauntes of or in the ſame: hathe therfore cauſed and commaunded this his mooſte hyghe courte of Parlyamente, for ſondrye and manye vrgente cauſes and conſyderations, to be at this tyme ſommoned, and alſoo a Synode and conuocation of all the archebyſſhoppes, byſſhoppes, and other lerned men of the clergy of this his realme, to be in lyke maner aſſembled.
            
               And for as moche as in the ſayde parliament Synode and conuocation, there were certayne articles matiers and queſtions proponed & ſetforthe, touchinge Chriſten religion, that is to ſaye. ¶ Firſt, whether in the moſte bleſſed Sacrament of thaltar remayneth after the conſecration, the ſubſtaunce of bread and wyne, or no. ¶ Secondly, whether it be neceſſary by goddes lawe, that all men ſhoulde be communicate with both kyndes or no. ¶ Thirdly, whether prieſtes, that is to ſaye, men dedicate to God by prieſthode, maye by the lawe of God, marye after, or no. ¶ Fourthly, whether vowe of chaſtitie or wydowhed made to God aduiſedly by man or woman, be by the law of God to be obſerued or no. ¶ Fyftly, whether priuate Maſſes ſtande with the lawe of God, and be to be vſed and continued in the church and congregation of England, as thinges, wherby good Chriſten people maye and do receyue bothe godly conſolation, and holſome benefytes, or no. ¶ Sixtly, whether Auricular confeſſion is neceſſarye to be reteyned, continued, vſed, and frequented in the church, or no. ¶ The kynges moſt royall maieſtie, moſt prudently ponderynge and conſyderynge, that by occaſion of variable and ſondry opinions and iudgementes of the ſayde articles, great diſcorde and variance hathe aryſen, aſwell amongeſt the clergy of this his realme, as amongeſte a great nombre of the vulgar people, his louynge ſubiectes of the ſame: And beynge in a full hope and truſt, that a full and perfect reſolution of the ſayde articles, ſhulde make a perfyte concorde and vnitie generally amonges all his louynge and obedient ſubiectes, of his moſt excellent goodnes not onely commaunded, that the ſayde articles ſhulde deliberatly and aduyſedly, by his ſayde archebyſſhops, byſhops, and other lerned men of his clergye, be debated argued, and reaſoned, and their opinions therin to be vnderſtand declared & knowen, but alſo moſt graciouſly voucheſaued, in his owne princely perſone, to diſcende and come into his ſayd hyghe courte of Parlyament and councell, and there lyke a prince of moſt hyghe prudence, and no leſſe lernynge, opened and declared many thinges of hygh lernyng and great knowlege, touchinge the ſayd articles mattiers and queſtions, for an vnitie to be had in the ſame. Whervpon after a great and longe deliberate and aduiſed diſputation and conſultation had and made, concernynge the ſayde articles, as well by the conſent of the kynges hyghenes, as by thaſſent of the Lordes ſpirituall and temporall, and other lerned men of his clergye in their conuocation, and by the conſent of the commons in this preſent Parliamēt aſſembled, it was and is fynally reſolued accorded and agreed in maner & fourme folowynge. That is to ſay. ¶ Firſt, that in the moſt bleſſed Sacrament of the altare, by the ſtrength and efficacy of Chriſtes myghty worde (it beynge ſpoken by the prieſt) is preſent really vnder the forme of bread & wyne, the naturall body & bloud of our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſt, conceyued of the virgyn Mary: And that after the conſecration there remayneth no ſubſtance of bred or wyne nor any other ſubſtance, but the ſubſtāce of Chriſt, God and man.
            
               ¶Secondly, that communion in both kyndes, is not neceſſary Ad ſalutem, by the lawe of God to all perſons. And that it is to be beleued & not doubted of, but that in the fleſſhe, vnder fourme of bred, is the very bloud: and with the bloude, vnder fourme of wyne, is the very fleſſhe aſwell aparte, as thoughe they were both togyther.
            ¶ Thirdly, that prieſtes, after the order of prieſthode receyued, as afore, maye not marye by the lawe of God.
            ¶ Fourthly, that vowes of chaſtitie or wydowhed, by man or woman made to God aduiſedly, ought to be obſerued by the lawe of God: and that it exempteth them frome other liberties of Chriſten people, which without that they might enioye.
            ¶ Fyftly, that it is mete and neceſſary, that priuate Maſſes be continued and admitted in this the kynges Englyſhe churche and congregation, as wherby good Chriſten people, orderynge theym ſelfes accordyngly, do receyue both godly and goodly conſolations and benefytes: and it is agreable alſo to goddes lawe.
            ¶ Sixtly, that Auricular confeſſion is expedient and neceſſary to be reteyned and continued vſed and frequented in the church of God. For the whiche moſt godly ſtudy peyne and trauayle of his maieſtie, and determination and reſolution of the premiſſes, his moſte humble & obedient ſubiectes, the lordes ſpirituall and temporall, and the commons in this preſent parliament aſſembled, not onely rendre and gyue vnto his hyghenes, their moſt hyghe and harty thankes, and thinke them ſelfes moſt bonden, to praye for the longe continuance of his graces moſt royall eſtate, but alſo beyng deſyrous, that his moſte godly enterpriſe maye be well accomplyſſhed and brought to a full ende and perfection, and ſo eſtablyſſhed, that the ſame myght be to the honour of God, and after to the common quiete vnitie and concord to be had in the hole body of this realme for euer. Moſt humbly beſechen his royall maieſtie, that the reſolution and determination aboue writen of the ſayde articles, maye be eſtablyſſhed and perpetually perfyted by authoritie of this preſent parliament. It is therfore ordeyned and enacted by the kynge our ſouerayne lorde, the lordes ſpirituall and temporall, and the commons in this preſent parliament aſſembled, and by the authoritie of the ſame, that yf any perſon or perſons within this realme of Englande, or any other the kynges dominiōs, after the .xii. daye of Iuly nexte commynge, by worde, wrytinge, imprinting, cyfring, or in any other wyſe, do publyſſhe, preache, teache ſaye, afferme, declare, diſpute, argue, or hold any opinion, that in the bleſſed Sacrament of the altare, vnder fourme of bred and wyne (after the conſecration therof) there is not preſent, really, ye naturall body and bloude of our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſt, conceyued of the virgyn Marye, or that after the ſayd conſecration, there remayneth anye ſubſtance of bred or wyne, or any other ſubſtance, but the ſubſtance of Chriſt, God and man. Or after the tyme aboue ſayde, publyſſhe, preache, teache, ſaye, afferme, declare, diſpute, argue, or holde opinion, that in the fleſſhe,

            ¶And furthermore be it enacted by the authoritie of this preſent parlyament, that yf any perſon or perſons, after the ſayd .xii. day of Iuly, preache in any ſermon or collation, openly made to the kynges people: or reache in anye common ſchole, or to other congregacion of people: or beynge called before ſuche iudges, and accordynge to ſuche fourme of the lawe, as hereafter ſhalbe declared, do obſtinately afferme, vpholde, maynteyne or defende: that the communion of the ſayde bleſſed Sacrament in bothe kyndes, that is to ſaye, in fourme of bred and alſo of wyne, is neceſſary for the helthe of mans ſoule, to be gyuen or miniſtred, or ought or ſhulde be gyuen or miniſtred to any perſon in both kyndes.
