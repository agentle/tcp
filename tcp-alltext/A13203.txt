               W. T. To the Reader.
               
                  WHen I had tranſlated the newe teſtament / I added a piſtle vnto the latter ende / In which I deſyred them yt were learned to amend if ought were founde amyſſe. But oure malicious and wylye hypocrytes which are ſo ſtubburne and hard herted in their weked abhominaciōs that it is not poſſible for them to amend any thinge atall (as we ſee by dayly experience when their both lyvinges and doinges are rebufed with the trouth) ſaye / ſome of them that it is unpoſſible to tranſlate the ſcripture in to Engliſh / ſome that it is not lawfull for the laye people to have it in their mother tonge / ſome that it wold make them all heretyfes / as it wold no doute from many thinges which they of longe tyme haue falſly taught / ād that is the whole cauſe wherfore they forbyd it / though they other clokes pretende. And ſome or rather every one / ſaye that it wold make them ryſe ageynſt the kinge / whom they them ſelves (vnto their damnatyō) never yet obeyed. And lefte the temporall rulars ſhuld ſee their falſehod / if the ſcripture cam to light / cauſeth them ſo to lye.
               And as for my tranſlatid in which they afferme vnto the laye people (as I haue hearde ſaye)

to be I wotte not how many thouſande hereſyes / ſo that it cā not be mēded or correcte / they haue yet taken ſo greate payne to cramyne it / & to compare it vnto that they wold fayne haue it and to their awne imaginations and iugglin ge termes / and to haue ſome what to rayle at / and vnder that cloke to blaſpheme the treuth / that they myght with as litle laboure (as I ſuppoſe) haue tranſlated the moſte parte of the bible. For they which in tymes paſte were wont to loke on no more ſcripture then they ſounde in their duns or ſoch like develyſh doctryne / haue yet now ſo narowlye loked on my tranſlatyon / that there is not ſo moch as one I therin if it lack
                     •
                   a tytle over his hed / but they haue noted it / and nombre it vnto the ignorant people for anhereſy. Fynallye in this they be all agreed / to dryve you from the knowledge of the ſcripture / & that ye ſhall not haue the terte therof in the mother tonge / and to kepe the world ſtyll in darkeneſſe / to thentent they might ſirt in the conſciences of the people / thorow vayne ſuperſtition and falſe doctrine / to ſatiſfye their fylthy luſtes their proude ambition / and vnſatiable covetuouſnes / and to exalte their awne honoure aboue kinge & emperoure / yee & aboue god him ſilfe
               ¶ A thouſand bokes had they lever to be put forth agenſce their abhominable doynges and doctrine / then that the ſcripture ſhulde come to light. For as longe as they may kepe that doune / they will ſo darken the ryght way with the

miſte of their ſophiſtrye / and ſo tangle thē that ether rebuke or deſpyſe their abhommations with argumentes of philoſophye & with wordly ſymylitudes and apparent reaſons of naturall wiſdom. And with wreſtinge the ſcripture vnto their awne purpoſe clene contrarye vnto y• proceſſe / order and meaninge of the texte / and ſo delude them in deſcantynge vppon it with al ligoryes / and amaſe thē expoundinge it in manye ſenſes before the vnlerned laye people (when it hath but one ſymple litterall ſenſe whoſe light the owles cā not abyde) that though thou feale in thyne harte and arte ſure how that all is falſe yt they ſaye / yet coudeſte thou not ſolve their ſotle rydles.
               ¶ Which thinge onlye moved me to tranſlate the new teſtament. Becauſe I had perceaved by experyence / how that it was impoſſible to ſtablyſh the laye people in any truth / excepte yo ſcripture were playnly layde beſore their eyes in their mother tonge / that they might ſe the proceſſe / ordre and meaninge of the texte: for els what ſo ever truth is taught them / theſe ennymyes of all truth qwench it ageyne / partly with the ſmoke of their bottomleſſe pyite wherof thou readeſt apocalipſis .ix. that is / with apparent reaſons of ſophiſtrye & traditions of their awne makynge / founded with out grounde of ſcripture / and partely in iugglinge with the texte / expoundinge it in ſoch a ſenſe as is impoſſible

to gether of the texte / if thou ſee the proceſſe ordre and meaninge therof.
               ¶ And even in the biſſhope of londons houſe I entended to have done it. For when I was ſo turmoyled in the conire where I was that I coude no lenger there dwell (the proceſſe wherof were to longe here to reherce) I this wyſe thought in my ſilfe / this I ſuffre becauſe the preſtes of the contre be vnlerned / as god it knoweth there are a full ignorant ſorte which haue ſene no more latyn then that they read in their porteſſes and miſſales which yet many of them can ſcacely read (excepte it be Albertus deſecretis mulierū in which yet / thought they be never ſo ſoryly lerned / they pore day and night and make notes therin and all to teach the mydwyves as they ſay / and linwod a boke of conſtitutions together tithes / mortuaryes / offeringes / cuſtoms / and other pillage / which they calle / not theirs / but godes parte and the deuty of holye chirch / to diſcharge their conſciences with all for they are bound that they ſhall not dimynyſh / but encreace all thinge vnto the vttmoſt of their powers) and therfore (becauſe they are thus vnlerned thought I) when they come to gedder to the alehouſe / which is their preachinge place / they afferme that my ſainges are hereſy. And beſydes yt they adde to of thir awne heddes which I never ſpake / as the maner is to prolonge the tale to ſhorte

the tyme with all / and accuſe me ſecretly to the chauncelare and other the biſhopes officers / And indeade when I cam before the chauncelare / he thretened me grevouſly / and rexyled me and rated me as though I had bene a dogge / and layd to my charge wherof there coude be none accuſer brought forth (as their maner is not to bringe forth the accuſer) and yet all the preſtes of ye contre were yt ſame daye there. As I this thought the biſhope of london came to my remembrance whom Eraſmus (whoſe tonge maketh of litle gnattes greate elephātes and lifteth vpp aboue the ſtarres whoſoever geveth him a litle exhibition) prayſeth excedingly amonge other in his annotatyons on the new teſtament for his great learninge. Then thought I / if I might come to this mannes ſervice / I were happye. And ſo I gate me to london / & thorow the accoyntaunce of my maſter came to ſir harry gilford the kinges graces countroller / ād brought him an oration of Iſocrates which I had tranſlated out of greke in to Engliſh / and deſyred him to ſpeake vnto my lorde of london for me / which he alſo did as he ſhewed me / ād willed me to write a piſtle to my lorde / and to god to him my ſilf which I alſo did / and delivered my piſtle to a ſervant of his awne / one wyllyam he bil

                  hwayte / a mā of myne old accoyntaūce. But god which kneweth what is within hypocrites / ſawe that I was begyled / ād that that councell was not the nexte way vnto

my purpoſe. And therfore he gate me no favoure in my lordes ſight ¶ Wherevppō my lorde anſwered me / his houſe was full / he had mo thē he coude well finde / and adviſed me to ſeke in london / wher he ſayd I coude not lacke a ſervice / And ſo in london I abode almoſte an yere / and marked the courſe of the worlde / and herde oure pratars / I wold ſay oure preachers how they boſted them ſelves and their hye authorite / and beheld the pompe of oure prelates and how beſyed they were as they yet are / to ſet peace and vnite in the worlde (though it be not poſſible for them that walke in darkeneſſe to cō
                  tinue longe in peace / for they can not but ether ſtōble or daſh them ſelves at one thinge or another that ſhall clene vnquyer all togedder) & ſawe thinges wherof I deferre to ſpeake at this tyme and vnderſtode at the laſte not only that there was no rowme in my lorde of londons palace to tranſlate the new teſtament / but alſo that there was no place to do it in all englonde / as experience doth now openly declare. ¶ Vnder what maner therfore ſhuld I now ſubmitte this boke to be corrected and amended of them / which can ſuffer nothinge to be well▪ Or what

And of which the prophete fayth Pſalme .cxvii. Thou haſte cōmaunded thy lawes to be kepte meod / yt is in hebrew excedingly / with all diligēce / might & power / and haue made thē ſo mad with their iugglinge charmes and crafty perſuaſiōs that they thinke it full ſatiſfaction for all their weked lyvinge / to tormē

               ¶ Notwithſtōdinge yet I ſubmytte this boke and all other that I haue other made or trāſlated / or ſhall in tyme to come (if it be goddes will that I ſhall further laboure in his herveſt) vnto all them that ſubmytte thē ſelves vn to the worde of god / to be corrected of thē / yee and moreover to be diſalewed & alſo burnte / if it ſeme worthy when they have examyned it wyth the hebrue / ſo that they firſt put forth of their awne tranſlatinge a nother that is more correcte.
            
            
               
               ¶ A prologe ſhewinge the vſe of the ſcripture
               
                  THough a man had a precious iuell and a rich / yet if he wiſte not the value therof nor wherfore it ſerved / he were nother the better nor ryeher of a ſtraw. Eyen ſo though we read the ſcripture & bable of it never ſo moch / yet if we know not the vſe of it / and wherfore it was geven / and what is theim to be ſought / it profiteth vs nothinge at all. It is not ynough therfore to read and talke of it only / but wo muſt alſo deſyre god daye and night inſtantly to open oure eyes / ād to make vs vnderſtond and feale wherfore the ſcripture was geuen / that we maye applye the medicyne of the ſcripture / every mā to his awne ſores / inleſſe then we entend to beydle diſputers / and braulers aboute vayne wordes / ever gnaw enge vppon the bitter barcke with out and newer attayninge vnto the ſwetepith with in / and perſequutinge one and other for defendinge of lewde imaginacions and phantaſyes of oure arene invencyon
               ¶ Paule in ye thyrde of ye ſecōde epiſtle to Tymo the ſayth / yt the ſcripture is good to teache (for yt ought mē to teach & not dreames of their awne makige / as ye pope doth) & alſo to improvt / for ye ſcripture is y• twichſtone yt tryeth all doctrynes / & by yt we know the falſe from ye true.

And in the .vi. to the epheſians he calleth it the ſwerd of the ſpirite / by cauſe it killeth hyppocrites and vttereth āo improveth their falſe inventyons. And in the. 
                     ••
                  . to the Romayns he ſayth all that are wryten / are wryten for oure learninge / that we thorow pacyence and cōſorte of the ſcripture myght have hope. That is / the enſamples that are in the ſcripture comforte vs in all oure tribulacyons / and make vs to put oure truſte in god / and pacyently to abyde his leyſure. And in the .x. of the firſte to the Corinthyans he bringeth in examples of the ſcripture of feare vs and to bridle the fleſhe / that we caſte not the yoke of the lawe of god from of oure neckes / and fall to luſtynge and doinge of evill.
               ¶ So now the ſcripture is a light and ſheweth vs the true waye / both what to do / and what to hope. And a defence from all erroure / and a comforte in adverſyte that we deſpayre not. and feareth vs in proſperyte that we ſynne not Sec̄e therfore in the ſcripture as thou readeſt it firſt the law / what god cōmaundeth vs to doo. And ſecundarylye the promyſes / which god promyſeth vs ageyne / namely in Chriſte Ieſu oure lorde. Then ſeke enſamples / firſte of comſorte / how god purgeth all them that ſubmitte them ſelves to walke in his wayes / in the purgatorye of tribulatyon / delyveringe them yet at tye latter ende / and never ſoferinge any of them to peryſh / that cleave faſte to his promyſes. And fynallye / note the enſamples which are writen

to feare the fleſh that we ſynne not. That is / how god ſuffereth the vngodlye and weked ſynners that reſiſte god and refuſe to folow him / to contynue in their wekedneſſe / ever waxinge worſe and worſe vntyll their ſynne be ſo ſore encreaſed and ſo abhomynable / that if they ſhuld longer endure they wold corrupte the very electe. But for the electes ſake god ſendeth thē preachers. Nevertheleſſe they harden their hartes agenſte the truth / and god deſtroyeth thē vtterlye and begynneth the world a new.
               ¶ This comforte ſhalt thou evermore finde in the playne texte and luerall ſenſe. Nether is there any ſtorye ſo homely / ſo rude / yee or ſo vyle (as it ſemeth outwarde) wherin is not exceadinge greate comforte. And when ſome which ſeme to them ſelves great clarkes ſaye: they wott not what moare profite is in many geſtes of the ſcripture if they be read with out an allegotye / then in a tale of robenhode / ſaye thou: that they were wryten for oure conſolacyon and comforte / that we deſpayre not / if ſoch likehappen vnto vs. We be not holyer then Noe / though he were once dronke.

Nether are we holyer then David / though he brake wedlocke and vppon the ſame commytted abhomynable murther. All thoſe men have witnesse

of the ſcripture that they pleaſed god and ware good men both before that thoſe thinges chaunſed them and alſo aſter. Nevertheleſſe ſoch thinges happened them foroure enſampler not that we ſhuld contrafayte their evill / but if whyle we fight with oure ſelves enforſynge to walke in the law of god (as they did) we yet fall likewiſe / that we deſpayre not / but come agayn▪ to the lawes of god and take better holde

Where thou ſeeſt that though the deades of the evel apere outwardly as gloryous as the deades of the good: yet in the ſight of god which loketh on the harte / the deade is good becauſe of the man / and not the man good becauſe of his deade. In the vj. God ſendeth Noe to preach to the weked and geueth them ſpace to repent: they wax hard herted / God bringeth them to nought And yet ſaveth Noe: even by the ſame water by which he deſtroyed them.

                     IN the begynnynge God created heaven and erth. The erth was voyde and emptie / ād darckneſſe was vpon the depe / and the ſpirite of god moved vpon the water
                  Than God ſayd: let there be lyghte and there was lyghte. And God ſawe the lyghte that it was good: & devyded the lyghte from the darckneſſe / and called the lyghte daye / and the darckneſſe nyghte: and ſo of the evenynge and mornynge was made the fyrſt daye
                  And God ſayd: let there be a fyrmament betwene the waters / ād let it devyde the waters a ſonder. Than God made the fyrmament and parted the waters which were vnder the fyrmament / from the waters that were above the fyrmament: And it was ſo. And God called the fyrmament heaven / And ſo of the evenynge and morninge was made the ſeconde daye
                  And God ſayd / let the waters that are vnder heaven gather them ſelves vnto one place / that the drye londe may appere: And it came ſo to paſſe. And god called the drye lande the erth and the gatheringe togyther of waters called

                     And God ſayd: let the erth bringe forth herbe and graſſe that ſowe ſeed / and frutefull trees that bere frute every one in his kynde / havynge their ſeed in them ſelves vpon the erth. And it came ſo to paſſe: ād the erth brought forth herbe and graſſe ſowenge ſeed every one in his kynde & trees berynge frute & havynge their ſeed in thē ſelves / every one in his kynde. And God ſawe that it was good: and thē of the evenynge and mornynge was made the thyrde daye.
                  Than ſayd God: let there be lyghtes in ye firmament of heaven to devyde the daye frō the nyghte / that they may be vnto ſygnes / ſeaſons / days & yeares. And let them be lyghtes in the fyrmament of heavē / to ſhyne vpon the erth. & ſo it was. And God made two great lyghtes A greater lyghte to rule the daye / & a leſſe lyghte to rule the nyghte / and he made ſterres alſo. And God put them in the fyrmament of heaven to ſhyne vpon the erth / and to rule the daye & the nyghte / ād to devyde the lyghte from darckneſſe. And god ſawe yt it was good: and ſo of the evenynge ād mornynge was made the fourth daye.

he gaue him a charge ſaynge: ſe thou take not a wife of the doughters of Canaan: and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother / & was gone vnto Meſopotamia: and ſeynge alſo that the doughters of Canaan pleaſed not Iſaac his father: Then went he vnto Iſmael / and toke vnto the wiues which he had / Mahala the doughter of Iſmael Abrahams ſonne / the ſiſter of Nabaioth to be his wife.
                  Jacob departed from Berſeba and went toward Haran / and came vnto a place and taried there all nyghte / becauſe the ſonne was downe. And toke a ſtone of the place / and put it vnder his heade / and layde him downe in the ſame place to ſlepe. And he dreamed: and beholde there ſtode a ladder apon the erth / and the topp of it reached vpp to heauē. And ſe / the angells of God went vp and downe apon it / yee ād the LORde ſtode apon it and ſayde.
                  I am the LORde God of Abraham thi father and the God of Iſaac: The londe which thou ſlepeſt apon will I geue the and thy ſeed. And thy ſeed ſhalbe as the duſt of the erth: And thou ſhalt ſpreade abrode: weſt / eaſt / north and ſouth. And thorow the and thy ſeed ſhall all the kynreddes of the erth be bleſſed. And ſe I am with the / and wylbe thy keper in all places whother thou gooſt / & wyll brynge y• agayne in to this lande: Nether will I leaue the vntill I haue made good / all that I haue promyſed the.
                  
                     When Jacob was awaked out of his ſlepe / he ſayde: ſurely the LORde is in this place / ād I was not aware. And he was afrayde & ſayde how fearfull is this place? it is none other / but euen the houſe of God and the gate of heauē. And Jacob ſtode vp early in the mornynge and toke the ſtone that he had layde vnder his heade / and pitched it vp an ende and poured oyle on the topp of it. And he called the name of the place Bethell / for in dede the name of the citie was called Lus before tyme.
                  And Jacob vowed a vowe ſaynge: Yf God will be with me and wyll kepe me in this tourney which I goo and will geue me bread to eate and cloothes to put on / ſo that I come agayne vnto my fathers houſe in ſaftie: then ſhall the LORde be my God / and this ſtone which I haue ſett vp an ende / ſhalbe godes houſe / And of all that thou ſhalt geue me / will I geue the tenth vnto the.

And as he loked aboute / behold there was a well in the feld / and .iij. flockes of ſhepe laye therby (for at that well were the flockes watered) & there laye a great ſtone at the well mouth And the maner was to brynge the flockes thyther / & to roull the ſtone frō the welles mouth and to water the ſhepe / and to put the ſtone agayne

vppon the wells mouth vnto his place.
                  And Jacob ſayde vnto thē: brethern / whē

And they ſayde: he is in good health: and boholde / his doughter Rahel cometh with y• ſhepe. And he ſayde: lo / it is yet a great whyle to nyghte / nether is it tyme yt the catell ſhulde be gathered together: water the ſhepe and goo and fede thē. And they ſayde: we maye not / vntill all ye flockes be brought together & the ſtone be roulled frō the wells mouth / and ſo we water oure ſhepe.
                  Whyle he yet talked with thē / Rahel came with hir fathers ſhepe / for ſhe kepte them. As ſoone As Jacob ſawe Rahel / the doughter of Laban his mothers brother / and the ſhepe of Laban his mothers brother / he went and rowled the ſtone frō the wells mouth / and watered the ſhepe of Labā his mothers brother And Jacob kyſſed Rahel / and lyfte vp his voyce and wepte: and tolde her alſo yt he was hir fathers brother and Rebeccas ſonne. Thē Rahel ranne and tolde hir father.

Abyde with me the ſpace of a moneth. And afterward Laban ſayd vnto Jacob: though thou be my brother / ſhuldeſt thou therfore ſerue me for nought? tell me what ſhall thi wages be? And Laban had .ij. doughters / the eldeſt called Lea and the yongeſt Rahel. Lea was tender eyed: But Rahel was bewtifull ād well fauored. And Jacob loued her well / and ſayde: I will ſerue the .vij. yere for Rahel thy yongeſt doughter. And Laban anſwered: it is better y• I geue her the / than to another man? byde therfore with me.
                  And Jacob ſerued .vij. yeres for Rahel / and they ſemed vnto him but a fewe dayes? for the loue he had to her. And Jacob ſayde vnto Laban / geue me my wife / that I mayely e with hir for the tyme appoynted me is come.

                  And when the mornynge was come / beholde it was Lea. Than ſayde he to Laban: wherfore haſt thou played thus with me? dyd not I ſerue the for Rahel / wherfore than haſt thou be gyled me?

                  When the LORde ſawe that Lea was deſpiſed / he made her frutefull: but Rahel was baren. And Lea conceaued and bare a ſonne / ād called his name Rubē / for ſhe ſayde:: the LORde hath loked apon my tribulation. And now my huſbonde will loue me. And ſhe conceaued agayne and bare a ſonne / and ſayde: the LORde hath herde that I am deſpiſed / ād hath therfore geuen me this ſonne alſo / and ſhe called him Simeon. And ſhe conceaued yet and bare a ſonne / ād ſayde: now this once will my huſbonde kepe me company / becauſe I haue borne him .iij. ſonnes: and therfore ſhe called his name Levi.

And the .vij. leane and euell fauored kyne ate vpp the firſt .vij. fatt kyne And when they had eaten them vp / a man cowde not perceaue that they had eatē them: for they were ſtill as evyll fauored as they were at the begynnynge. And I awoke.
                  And I ſawe agayne in my dreame .vij. eares ſprynge out of one ſtalk full and good / and .vij. other eares wytherd / thinne and blaſted with wynde / ſprynge vp after them. And the thynne eares deuowred the .vij. good eares. And I haue tolde it vnto the ſothſayers

/ but no man can tell me what it meaneth.
                  Then Joſeph ſayde vnto Pharao: both Pharaos dreames are one. And god doth ſhewe Pharao what he is aboute to do. The vij. good kyne are. vij yeres: & the .vij. good eares are .vij. yere alſo / and is but one dreame. Lykewyſe / the .vij. thynne and euell fauored kyne that came out after them / are .vij. yeares: and the .vij. emptie and blaſted eares ſhalbe vij. yeares of hunger. This is that which I ſayde vnto Pharao / that God doth ſhewe Pharao what he is aboute to doo.
                  Beholde there ſhall come .vij. yere of great plenteouſnes through out all the lande of Egypte. And there ſhall aryſe after them vij. yeres of hunger. So that all the plenteouſnes ſhalbe forgeten in the lande of Egipte. And the hunger ſhall conſume the lande: ſo that the plenteouſnes ſhall not be once aſene in the land by reaſon of that hunger that ſhall come after / for it ſhalbe exceading great And as concernynge that the dreame was dubled vnto Pharao the ſecond tyme / it be
                        •
                     okeneth that the thynge is certanly prepared of God / ād that God will ſhortly brynge it to paſſe.
                  Now therfore let Pharao provyde for a man of vnderſtondynge and wyſdome / and ſett him over the lande of Egipte. And let

Pharao make officers ouer the lande / and take vp the fyfte parte of the land of Egipte in the vij. plenteous yeres and let them gather all the foode of theſe good yeres that come / ād lay vp corne vnder the power of Pharo: that there may be foode in the cities / and there let them kepte it: that there may be foode in ſtoore in the lande / agaynſt the .vij. yeres of hunger which ſhall come in the lande of Egipte / and that the lande periſhe not thorow hunger.
                  And the ſaynge pleaſed Pharao ād all his ſeruauntes. Than ſayde Pharao vnto his ſeruavauntes: where ſhall we fynde ſch a mā as this is / that hath the ſprete of God in him? wherfore Pharao ſayde vnto Joſeph: for as moch as God hath ſhewed the all this / there is no man of vnderſtondyng nor of wyſdome lyke vnto the Thou therfore ſhalt be ouer my houſe / and acordinge to thy worde ſhall all my people obey: only in the kynges ſeate will I be aboue the. And he ſayde vnto Joſeph: beholde / I haue ſett the ouer all the lande of Egipte. And he toke off his rynge from his fyngre / and put it vpon Joſephs fingre / and arayed him in raymēt of biſſe / and put a golden cheyne aboute his necke and ſet him vpon the beſt charett that he had ſaue one. And they cryed before him Abrech / ād that Pharao had made him ruelar ouer all the lande of Egipte.
                  And Pharao ſayde vnto Joſeph: I am Pharao / without thi will / ſhall no man lifte vp other

his hande or fote in all the lande of Egipte. And he called Joſephs name Zaphnath Paenea. And he gaue him to wyfe Aſnath the doughter of Potiphara preaſt of On. Than went Joſeph abrode in the lāde of Egipte. And he was .xxx. yere olde whē he ſtode before Pharao kynge of Egipte. And than Joſeph departed from Pharao / and went thorow out all the lande of Egipte.
                  And in the .vij. plēteous yeres they made ſheves and gathered vp all the fode of the .vij. plenteous yeres which were in the lande of Egipte and put it in to the cities. And he put the food of the feldes that grewe rounde aboute euery cyte: euen in the ſame. And Joſeph layde vp corne in ſtoore / lyke vnto the ſande of the ſee in multitude out of meſure / vntyll he left nombrynge: For it was with out nombre.
                  And vnto Joſeph were borne .ij. ſonnes before the yeres of hunger came / which Aſnath the doughter of Potiphara preaſt of On / bare vnto him. And he called the name of the firſt ſonne Manaſſe / for God (ſayde he) hath made me forgett all my laboure & all my fathers huſholde. The ſeconde called he Ephraim / for God (ſayde he) hath cauſed me to growe in the lande of my trouble.
                  And when the .vij. yeres of plenteouſnes that was in the lande of Egypte were ended / than came the .vij. yeres of derth / acordynge as

Joſeph had ſayde. And the derth was in all landes: but in the lāde of Egipte was there yet foode. When now all the lande of Egipte began to hunger / than cried the people to Pharao for bread. And Pharao ſayde vnto all Egipte: goo vnto Joſeph / and what he ſayth to you that doo And when the derth was thorow out all the lande / Joſeph opened all that was in the cities and ſolde vnto the Egiptiās And hunger waxed ſore in the land of Egipte. And all countrees came to Egipte to Joſeph for to bye corne: becauſe that the hunger was ſo ſore in all landes.

The bleſſinges of thy father were ſtronge: euen as the bleſſinges of my elders / after the deſyre of the hieſt in the worlde / and theſe bleſſinges ſhall fall on the head of Ioſeph / and on the toppe of the head of him yt was ſeparat from his brethern.

                  All theſe are the .xij. tribes of Iſrael / & this is that which their father ſpake vnto them whē he bleſſed them / euery man with a ſeverall bleſſinge. And he charged them and ſayde vnto them. I ſhall be put vnto my people: ſe that ye burye me with my fathers / in the caue that is in the felde of Ephron the Hethyte / in the double caue that is in the felde before Mamre in the lande of Canaan. Which felde. Abraham boughte of Ephron the Hethite for a poſſeſſiō to burye in. There they buryed Abrahā and Sara his wyfe / there they buryed Iſaac & Rebecca his wyfe. And there I buried Lea: which felde & the caue that is therin / was bought of the childern of Heth.

               A PROLOGE IN TO THE SECONde boke of Moſes called Exodus.
               
               OF the preface vppō Geneſis mayſt thou vnderſtonde how to behaue thi ſilf in this boke alſo ād ī all other bokes of the ſcripture. Cleaue vnto the texte and playne ſtorye and endevoure thi ſilf to ſerch out the meaninge of all that is deſcribed therin and the true ſenſe of all maner of ſpeakynges of the ſcripture of proverbes, ſimilitudes ād borowed ſpeach, wherof I entreated in the ende of the obedience, and beware of ſotle allegoryes. And note euery thinge erneſtly as thinges partayninge vnto thyne awne herte and ſoule. For as god vſed hym ſylf vnto them of the old teſtament, even ſo ſhall he vnto the worldes ende vſe him ſilf vnto vs which haue receaved his holye ſcripture ād the teſtimonye of his ſonne Ieſus. As god doeth all thinges here for them that beleve his promiſes and herken vnto his commaundmentes and with pacience cleaue vnto him and walke with him: euen ſo ſhall he do for vs, yf we receaue the witneſſe of Chriſt with a ſtronge faith and endure paciently folowinge his ſteppes. And on the otherſyde, as they that fell from the promiſes of god thorow vnbeleffe and from his lawe and ordinaunces thorow impaciencie of their awne luſtes, were for ſaken of god ād ſo peryſhed: even ſo ſhall we as many as do lykewyſe and as

manye as mock with the doctine of chriſt and make a cloke of it to lyue fleſhlye ād to folowoure luſtes.
               Note therto how god is founde true at the laſt, and how when all is paſt remedye ād brought into deſperacion, he then fulfilleth his promiſes, and that by an abiecte and a caſtawaye, a deſpiſed and a refuſed perſon: ye and by awaye impoſſible to beleue.
               The cauſe of all captiuite of goddes people is this. The worlde ever hateth them for their fayth and truſt which they haue in god: but ī vayne vntill they falle frō the fayth of the promyſes ād love of the lawe ād ordinaunces of god, and put their truſt in holy deades of their awne findinge and live all to gether at their awne luſt and pleaſure without regard of god or reſpecte of their neygboure. Then god forſaketh vs and ſendeth vs in to captiuite for oure diſhonouringe of his name and deſpiſinge of oure neghboure. But the world perſecuteth vs for oure faith in chriſt only (as the pope now doeth) ād not for oure weked livinge For in his kīgdome thou maiſt quietly ād with licēce ād vnder a protectiō doo whath ſo euer abhominatiō thi herte luſteth: but god perſecuteth us becauſe we abuſe his holye teſtamēt, ād becauſe that whē we knowe the truth we folowe it not.
               
                  Note alſo the mightye hand of the Lorde how he playeth with his aduerſaries ād provoketh thē ād ſturreth thē vpp a litle ād a litle, ād deliuereth not his people in an houre: that both the paciēce of his electe ād alſo the worldly witte ād wilye policye of the weked wherwith they fight agaynſt god, might appeare.
               Marke the longeſoferinge and ſofte paciē
                  ce of Moſes and how he loveth the people ād is euer betwene the wrath of god ād thē ād is readye to lyue ād dye with thē ād to be put out of the boke that god had writen for their ſakes (as Paule for his brothren Roma .ix.) and how he taketh his awne wrōges pacientlie ād never avengeth him ſilf. And make not Moſes a figure of Chriſt with Rocheſtre: but an enſample vnto all princes ād to all that are in authorite how to rule vnto goddes pleaſure ād vnto their neyghbours profette. For there is not a perfecter lyffe in this world both to the honoure of god and profytte of his neygboure nor yet a greatter croſſe, thē to rule chriſtenlye. And of Aaren alſo ſe that thou make no figure of chriſt vntill he come vnto his ſacrifiſinge, but an enſample vnto all preachers of goddes worde, that they adde nothinge vnto goddes worde or take ought therfro.
               Note alſo how god ſendeth his promiſſe to

the people ād Moſes conſermeth it with miracles ād the people beleve. But whē tēptacion cometh they falle into vnbeleffe ād few byde ſtōdinge. Where thou ſeeſt that all be not chriſtē that wilbe ſo called, ād that the croſſe trieth the true frō the fayned: for yf the croſſe were not Chriſt ſhuld haue diſſiples ynowe. Wherof alſo thou ſeeſt what an excellent gifte off god true fayth is, ād impoſſible to be had with out the ſprete of god. For it is aboue all naturall power that a man in tyme of tēptation when god ſcorgeth him ſhuld beleue then ſtedfaſtlye how that god loveth him ād careth for hī ād hath prepared all good thinges for him, ād that that ſcorginge is as erneſt that god hath electe and choſe him.
               Note how oft Moſes ſturreth thē vpp to beleve ād to truſt in god, puttinge thē in remembraunce alwaye in tyme of temptation of the miracles and wonders which god had wrought before tyme in their eyſight. How diligently alſo forbiddeth he al that might with drawe their hartes from god? to put nought to goddes word: to take nought therfro: to do only that which is right in the ſyght of the Lorde: that they ſhuld make no maner image to knele doune before it: ye that they ſhuld make none altar of hewed ſtone for feare off images:

to ſlee the hethen Idolatres vtterly ād to deſtroye their Idolles ād cutte doune their groves where they worſhupped: And that they ſhulde not take the doughters of them vnto their ſonnes, nor geue their doughters to the ſonnes of them. And that whoſoeuer moued any of thē to worſhuppe falſe goddes, how ſo euer nye of kynne he were, they muſt accuſe him ād bryng him to deth, ye and whereſoeuer they hard of mā, womā or citye that worſhupped falſe goddes, they muſt ſlee thē ād deſtroye the citie for ever ād not bild it agayne. And all becauſe they ſhuld worſhuppe nothinge but God, nor put confidence in anythinge ſaue in his word Yee and how warneth he to beware of witch craft, ſorcery, inchauntment, negromātie ād all craftes of the devell, ād of dreamers, ſorthſayers and of myracledoers to deſtroye his worde, and that they ſhulde ſuffer none ſoch to lyue,
               Thou wilt happlye ſaye, They tell a man the truthe. What then? God will that we care not to knowe what ſhall come. He will haue vs care only to kepe his commaundmētes and to commytre all chaunſes vnto him He hath promyſed to care for vs and to kepe vs from all evell. All thinges are in his hande, he can remedye all thinges and wil for his truthes ſake, yf we praye him. In his promyſes only will he haue vs truſt ād there reſt ād to ſeke

no farther.
               How alſo doth he prouoke them to loue, euer reherſynge the benefites of God done to them allready and the godly promyſes that were to come? And how goodly lawes of loue geveth he? to helpe one another: and that a man ſhuld not hate his neyghboure in his harte, but loue him as him filf, Leuitici .xix. And what a charge geueth he in euery place over the poore and neadye: over the ſtraunger frendleſſe ād wedowe? And when he deſyreth to ſhew mercye, he reherſeth with all, the benefites of God done to them at their neade, that they myght ſea cauſe at the leſt waye in God to ſhew mercye of very loue vnto their neyghboures at the ir neade.
               Alſo there is no lawe ſo ſimple in apperaunce thorow out all the fiue bokes of Moſes, but that there is a greate reaſon of the makynge therof if a man ſerch diligently. As that a man is forbyd to ſeth a kyd in hys mothers milke, moueth vs vnto compaſſyon and to be pytyefull, As doth alſo that a man ſhall not offer the ſyre or dame and the yonge both in one daye Leuitici .xxij. For it myght ſeme a cruell thing in as moch as his mothers milke is as it were his bloude, wherfore god will not haue him ſod therin: but will haue a man ſhewe curteſye

vppon the very beaſtes: As in another place he commaundeth that we moſell not the mouth of the oxe that treadeth oute the corne (which maner of threſſhinge is vſed in hote contrees) and that becauſe we ſhuld moch rather not grudge to be liberall and kynde vnto mē that do vs ſervice. Or happlye God wold have no ſoch wanton meate vſed among hys people. For the kyd of it ſelf is noryſhinge and the gotes milke is reſtauretyue, and both to gether myght be to rancke and therfore forbodē or ſome other like cauſe therewas.
               Of the ceremonies, ſacrifices and tabernacle with all his glorye ād pompe vnderſtōde, that they were not permitted only, but alſo commaunded of God to lead the people in the ſhadowes of Moſes ād night of the old teſtamēt, vntyll the light of chriſt ād daye of the new teſtamēt were come: As children are ledde in the phantaſies of youth, vntyll the diſcretiō of māsage become vppon them. And all was done to kepe them from idolatrye. The tabernacle was ordened to the entent they might haue a place appoynted them to do their ſacrifices openly in the ſyght of the people ād namelye of the preaſtes which wayted therō: that it might be ſene that they dyd all thīge acordīg to gods word, and not after the Idolatrie of their awne

imaginacion. And the coſtlineſſe of the tabernacle ād the bewtye alſo pertayned therevnto, that they ſhuld ſe nothinge ſo bewtifull amonge the hethē, but that they ſhuld ſe more bewtifull ād wonderfull at home: becauſe they ſhuld not be moued to folowe them. And in like maner the diuers facions of the ſacrifices and ceremonies was to occupye their mindes that they ſhuld haue no luſt to folow the hethē: ād the multitude of them was, that they ſhuld haue ſo moch to do in kepinge thē that thei ſhuld haue no leyſure to ymagine other of their awne: yee and that gods word might be by in all that they dyd, that they might haue their fayth and truſt in God, which he can not haue, that ether foloweth his awne invencyons, or tradicyons of mēnes makynge wyth out Gods word.
               Finally God hath two teſtamentes: the old and the newe. The old teſtament is thoſe temporall promyſes which God made the childrē of Iſrael of a good londe and that he wolde defende them, and of welth and proſperyte ād of temporall bleſſynges of whiche thou readeſt ouer all the lawe of Moſes, But namelye Leuitici. xxv
                     •
                  . And Deuteromij .xxviij. ād the avoydynge of all threateninges and curſes off which thou readeſt lykewyſe everye where▪ but ſpecyallye in the two places aboue reherſed,

and the avoydinge of all punyſhmēt ordened for the tranſgreſſers of the lawe.
               And the old teſtamēt was bilt all to gether vppō the kepinge of the lawe ād ceremonyes and was the reward of kepinge of thē in this liffe only, ād reached no further then this liffe and this world, as thou readeſt leui .xviij. a mā that doth them ſhall live there in which texte Paule reherſeth Rom .x. and Gala .iij. That is, he that kepeth them ſhall haue this liffe gloriouſe accordinge to all the promiſes and bleſſinges of the lawe, and ſhall avoyde both all temporall puniſhment of the lawe, with al the threateninges and curſinges alſo. For nether the lawe, euen of the .x. cōmaundmentes nor yet the ceremonies iuſtifyed in the herte before god, or purifyed vnto the life to come. Inſomoch that Moſes at his deeth euen .xl. yere after the lawe and ceremonyes were geuen complayneth ſayenge: God hath not geven you an hart to vnderſtonde, nor eyes to ſe, nor eares to heare vnto this daye. As who ſhuld ſaye, god hath geuen you ceremonies, but ye know not the vſe of them, and hath geuē you a lawe, but hath not wryten it in youre hartes.
               Wherfore ſerveth the lawe then, yf it geue vs no power to do the lawe? Paule anſwereth the, that it was geuen to vtter ſynne onlye and

to make it appere. As a coroſye is layde vnto an old ſore, not to heale it, but to ſtere it vp ād to make the diſeaſe alyve, that a mā might feale in what ioperdye he is ād how nye deeth ād not aware, ād to make awaye vnto the healinge playſter. Euē ſo ſayth Paule Gala .iij. The lawe was geven becauſe of tranſgreſſiō (that is, to make the ſynne alyve that it might be felt and ſene) vntill the ſeed came vnto whom it was promiſed: that is to ſaie, vntil the childern of fayth came, or vntill Chriſt that ſeed in whom god promiſed Abrahā that all nations of the worlde ſhuld be bleſſed, came. That is, the lawe was geuē to vtter ſynne, deeth damnatiō and curſe, ād to dryve vnto Chriſt in whō forgeueneſſe, life, iuſtifyinge ād bleſſinges were promiſed, that we might ſe ſo greate love of god to vs ward in chriſt, that we hēceforth ouercome with kindneſſe might love againe ād of love kepe the cōmaūdmētes. So now he that goeth aboute to quiette his cōſciēce ād to iuſtifye him ſilf with the lawe, doth but heale his wondes with freatige coreſyes. And he that goeth aboute to purchaſe grace with ceremonies, doth but ſucke the alepope to qwēch his thirſt, in as moch as the ceremonies were not gevē to iuſtifie the herte, but to ſignifie the iuſtifiynge: and forgeueneſſe that is in chriſtes bloude
               
                  Of the ceremonies that they iuſtifie not, thou readeſt. Ebrues .x. It is impoſſible that ſynne ſhuld be done awaye with the bloud of oxē ād gootes. And of the lawe thou readeſt. Gala .iij. Yf there had bene a lawe geuē that coude haue quykened or geuē liffe, then had rightuouſneſſe or iuſtifyinge come by the lawe in dede. Now the lawe not only quyckeneth not the harte, but alſo woundeth it with conſcience of ſynne and miniſtreth deeth ād damnaciō vnto her: ij. Corin .iij. ſo that ſhe muſt neades dye ād be damned excepte ſhe finde other remedy, ſo farre it is of that ſhe is iuſtified or holpe by the lawe.
               The newe teſtament is thoſe euerlaſtinge promyſes which are made vs in chriſt the Lorde thorow out all the ſcripture. And that teſtamēt is bylt on faith ād not on workes. For it is not ſayde of that teſtament he that worketh ſhall lyue: But he that beleveth ſhall lyue, as thou readeſt. Ioan .iij. God ſo loued the worlde that he gaue his only begotē ſonne that none which beleue in hi ſhuld periſh but haue euerlaſtinge lyfe.
               And when this teſtament is preached and beleued, the ſprete entreth the hart and quyckeneth it, and geueth her lyfe and iuſtifieth her. The ſprete alſo maketh the lawe a lyuely thing

in the herte, ſo that a man bringeth forth good workes of his awne acord without compulſiō of the lawe, without feare of threateninges or curſinges: yee and with out all maner reſpecte or loue vnto any temporal pleaſure, But of the very power of the ſprete receaved thorow faith, As thou readeſt. Ioan .i. He gaue them power to be the ſonnes of God in that they beleued on his name. And of that power they worke: ſo that he which hath the ſprete of chriſt is now no moare a childe: he nether learneth or worketh now any longer for payne of the rodde or for feare of boogges or pleaſure of apples, But doth althinges of his awne courage As chriſt ſayeth. Ioan .vij. He that beleueth on me ſhall haue riuers of lyuinge water flowinge out of his belye. That is, All good workes ād all giftes of grace ſpringe out of him naturallye and by their awne accorde. Thou neadeſt not to wreſt good workes out of him as a mā wold wringe veriuce out of crabbes: Nay thei flow naturally out of him as ſpringes out off hilles or rockes.
               The newe teſtament was euer, euē from the beginning of the world. For there were alwaye promyſes of Chriſt to come by faith in whiche promyſes the electe were then iuſtifyed

inwardly before God, as outwardly before the world by kepynge of the lawe and ceremonies
               And in concluſyon as thou ſeyſt bleſſinges or curſynges folow the kepinge or breakynge of the lawe of Moſes: euē ſo naturally do bleſſynges or curſynges folow the breakyng or kepynge of the lawe of nature, out of which ſprī
                  ge all oure temporall lawes. So that whē the people kepe the temporall lawes of their lond temporall proſperite and all maner of ſoch tē
                  porall bleſſynge as thou readeſt of in Moſes doo accompanye them and fall vppon them. And contraryewyſe when they ſynne vnpuniſhed, ād whē the rulars haue no reſpecte vnto naturall equyte or honeſtye, thē God ſendeth his curſes amonge thē, as hungre, derth, moren banynge, peſtilēce, warre, oppreſſyon with ſtraunge ād wonderfull diſeaſes ād newekyndes of miſfortune ād evell lucke,
               Yf any mā axe me, ſeyng that faith iuſtifieth me why I worke? I anſwere loue cōpelleth me For as lōge as my ſoule fealeth what loue god hath ſhewed me in Chriſte, I can not but loue god agayne ād his will ād cōmaūdmētes and of loue worke them, nor cā they ſeme hard vn to me. I thinke not my ſelf better for my workynge, nor ſeke heuē nor an hyer place in heuē becauſe of it. For a chriſtē worketh to make

his weake brother perfecter, ād not to ſeke an hier place in heuē. I cōpare not my filf vnto him that worketh not: No, he that worketh not to daye ſhall haue grace to turne ād to worke tomorow, ād in the meane ceaſon I pytye hym ād praye for him.

                     THeſe are the names of the children of Iſrael, which came to Egipte with Iacob / euery man with his houſholde: Rubē, Simeon, Leui, Iuda, Iſachar, Zabulon, Beniamin, Dan, Neptali, Gad ād Aſer. All the ſoules that came out of the Ioynes of Iacob, were .lxx. and Ioſeph was in Egipte all redie. when Ioſeph was dead and all his brethern and all that generation: the children of Iſrael grewe, encreaſed, multiplied and waxed enceadinge myghtie: ſo that the londe was full of them.
                  Then there roſe vp a new kynge in Egipte which knewe not Ioſeph. And he ſayde vnto his folke: beholde the people of the childrē of Iſrael are moo ād mightier than we. Come on, let vs playe wiſely with them: leſt they multiplie, and then (yf there chaunce any warre) they ioyne them ſelues vnto oure enimies and fyghte ageynſt vs, and ſo gete them out of the lande.

But the more they vexed thē, the moare they multiplied and grewe: ſo that they abhorred the childrē of Iſrael. And the Egiptiās helde the childern of Iſrael in bondage without mercie, and made their lyues bitter vnto them with cruell laboure in claye and bricke, and all maner worke in the feldes, and in all maner of ſervice, which they cauſed thē to worke cruelly
                  And the kynge of Egipte ſayde vnto the mydwiues of the Ebrueſ women, of which the ones name was Ziphra ād the other Pua: whē ye mydwiue the women of the Ebrues and ſe in the byrth tyme that it is a boye, kyll it. But yf it be a mayde, let it lyue. Notwithſtonding the mydwiues feared God, and dyd not as the kinge of Egipte commaūded them: but ſaued the menchildern.
                  Thē the kinge of Egipte called for the midwiues ād ſayde vnto thē: why haue ye delt on this maner and haue ſaued the menchildern? And the mydwiues anſwered Pharao, that the Ebrues wemen were not as the wemen of Egipte: but were ſturdie women, and were delyuered yer the midwyues came at them. And God therfore delt well with the midwyues.

And the people multiplied and waxed very mightie. And becauſe the mydwiues feared God, he made them houſes.
                  Than Pharao charged all his pepple ſayng All the menchildern that are borne, caſt in to the ryuer and ſave the maydchildern a lyue.

                  ANd there wēt a mā of the houſe of Leui ād toke a doughter of Leui. And the wife cōceaued ād bare a ſonne. And whē ſhe ſawe that it was a propre childe, ſhe hyd him thre monethes longe. And whē ſhe coude no longer hyde him, ſhe toke a baſket of bulruſſhes ād dawbed it with ſlyme ād pytche, ād layde the childe therin, ād put it in the flagges by the riuers brynke. And his ſiſter ſtode a ferre of, to wete what wold come of it.
                  And the doughter of Pharao came doune to the riuer to waſhe her ſelfe, and hir maydens walked a longe by the riuers ſyde. And when ſhe ſawe the baſket amōge the flagges, ſhe ſent one of hir maydes and cauſed it to be fet. And whē ſhe had opened it ſhe ſawe the childe. and behold, the babe wepte. And ſhe had cōpaſſiō on it ād ſayde: it is one of the Ebrues childern
                  Then ſayde his ſiſter vnto Pharaos doughter: ſhall I goo and call vnto the a nurſe of the Ebrues wemen, to nurſe the the childe?

And the mayde ranne and called the childes mother. Thē Pharaos doughter ſaide vnto her Take this childe awaye ād nurſe it for me, ād I will rewarde the for thi laboure. And the woman toke the childe and nurſed it vp.
                  And whē the childe was growne, ſhe brought it vnto Pharaos doughter, and it was made hir ſonne, and ſhe called it Moſes, becauſe (ſayde ſhe) I toke him out of the water.
                  And it happened in theſe dayes when Mo ſes was waxte great, that he went out vnto his brethern ād loked on their burthens, and ſpied an Egiptian ſmytynge one of his brethern an Ebrue.

And he ſayde vnto him that dyd the wronge: wherfore ſmyteſt thou thine neyghboure? And he anſwered: who hath made the a ruelar or aiudge ouer vs? intendeſt thou to kill me, as thou killedſt the Egiptain? Then Moſes feared and ſayde: of a ſuertie the thinge is knowne. And Pharao her de of it and went aboute to ſlee Moſes: but he fled from Pharao ād dwelt in the lāde of Madian, and he ſatt doune by a welles ſyde.

And when they came to Raguel their father, he ſayde: how happeneth it that ye are come ſo ſoone to daye? And they anſwerede there was an Egiptiā that delyuered vs frō the ſhepardes, and alſo drewe vs water & waterd the ſhepe. And he ſayde vnto his doughters: where is he? why haue ye lefte the man? Goo call him that he maye eate bread.
                  And Moſes was content to dwell with the man. And he gaue Moſes Zipora his doughter which bare a ſonne, ād he called him Gerſon: for he ſayde. I haue bene a ſtraunger in a ſtraunge lande. And ſhe bare yet another ſonne, whom he called Elieſer ſayng: the God of my father is myne helper, and hath rid me out of the handes of Pharao.
                  And it chaunced in proceſſe of tyme, that the kinge of Egipte dyed, and the childern of Iſrael ſyghed by the reaſon of laboure and cryed. And their complaynt came vp vnto God from the laboure. And God remembred his promiſe with Abraham, Iſaac ād Iacob.

Then ſayde the kinge of Egipte vnto them: wherfore do ye, Moſes and Aaron, let the people frō their worke, gett you vnto youre laboure.

                  Then Pharao called for Moſes and Aarō and ſayde, praye ye vnto the Lorde that he may take awaye the frogges from me and from my people, and I will let the people goo, that they maye ſacrifice vnto the Lorde. And Moſes ſayde vnto Pharao: Appoynte thou the tyme

vnto me, when I ſhall praye for the and thy ſervauntes ād thy people, to dryue awaye the frogges from the and thy houſſe, ſo that they ſhall remayne but in in the riuer only. And he ſayde tomorow. And he ſayde: euen as thou haſt ſayde, that thou mayſt knowe that there is none like vnto the Lorde oure God. And the frogges ſhall departe from the ād from thyne houſes and from thy ſervauntes and from thy people, and ſhall remayne in the riuer only.
                  And Moses and Aaron went out frō Pharao, and Moſes cryed vnto the Lorde apō the apoyntment of frogges which he had made vnto Pharao. And the Lorde dyd accordinge to the ſaynge of Moſes. And the frogges dyed out of the houſſes, courtes and feldes. And they gathred them to gether vppon heppes: ſo that the lande ſtanke of them.
                  But when Pharao ſawe that he had reſt geuen him, he hardened his herte and herkened not vnto them, as the Lorde had ſayde. And the Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes: Saye vnto Aarō ſtretch out thy rodd and ſmyte the duſt of the lande that it maye turne to lyſe in all the londe of Egipte. And they dyd ſo. And Aaron ſtretched out his hande with his rodd and ſmote the duſt of the erth. ād it turned to lyſe both in man and beeſt, ſo that all the duſt of the lande

turned to lyſe, thorowe out all the lande of Egipte.
                  And the enchaunters aſſayde lykewyſe with their enchauntmentes to brynge forth lyſe, but they coude not. And the lyſe were both apon man and beeſt. Then ſayde the enchaunters vnto Pharao: it is the fingre of God. Neuerthelater Pharaos herte was hardened and he regarded them not, as the Lorde had ſayde.
                  And the Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes: ryſe vp early in the mornynge and ſtonde before Pharao, for he will come vnto the water: and ſaye vnto him, thus ſayth the Lorde: let my people goo, that they maye ſerue me. Yf thou wilt not let my people goo: beholde, I will ſende all maner flies both apon the and thy ſervauntes ād thy people and into thy houſſes. And the houſſes of the Egiptians ſhalbe full of flies, and the grounde where on they are. But I will ſeperate the ſame daye the londe of Goſan where my people are, ſo that there ſhall no flyes be there: that thou mayſt knowe that I am the Lorde vppon the erth. And I will put a deuiſion betwene my people and thine. And euen tomorow ſhall this myracle be done.
                  And the Lorde dyd euen ſo: and there came noyſom flyes in to the houſſe of Pharao,

and in to his ſervauntes houſſes and in to all the lōde of Egipte: ſo that the londe was marred with flyes. Then Pharao ſent for Moſes and Aaron and ſayde: Goo and do ſacrifice vnto youre God in the land. And Moſes anſwered: it is not mete ſo to do. for we muſt offer vnto the Lorde oure God, that whiche is an abhominatyon vnto the Egiptians: beholde, ſhall we ſacrifice that which is an abhominacion vnto the Egiptians before their eyes, and ſhall they not ſtone vs? we will therfore goo .iij. dayes yournay in to the deſerte and ſacrifice vnto the Lord oure God as he hath cō
                     maunded vs.
                  And Pharao ſayde: I will late you goo, that ye maye ſacrifice vnto the Lorde youre God in the wildernes: only goo not ferrre awaye, ād ſe that ye praye for me. And Moſes ſayde: beholde, I will goo out from the and praye vnto the Lorde, and the flyes ſhall departe frō Pharao and from his ſervauntes and from his people tomorow. But let Pharao from hēce forth deſceaue no moare, that he wolde not lett the people goo to ſacrifice vnto the Lorde.
                  And Moſes went out from Pharao and prayed vnto the Lorde. And the Lorde dyd as Moſes had ſaide: ād toke awaye the flies frō Pharao and from his ſervauntes ād from hys

people, ſo that there remayned not one. But for all that, Pharao hardened his herte euen then alſo and wolde not let the people goo,
               
               
                  ¶ The .ix. Chaptre.
                  ANd the Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes, goo vnto Pharao and tell him, thus ſayeth the Lorde God of the Ebrues: ſende out my people that they maye ſerue me. Yf thou wilt not let them goo but wilt holde them ſtyll: beholde, the hande of the Lorde ſhalbe apō thy catell which thou haſt in the feld apon horſes aſſes, camels, oxen, and ſhepe, with a mightye great morrayne. But the Lorde ſhall make a deuyſion betwene the beeſtes of the Iſrahelites, ād the beeſtes of the Egiptias: ſo that there ſhal nothing dye of all that perteyneth to the children of Iſrael. And the Lorde appoynted a tyme ſaynge: tomorow the Lorde ſhall do this thinge in the londe.
                  And the Lorde dyd the thinge on the morow, and all the catell of Egipte dyed: but of the catell of the children of Iſrael dyed not one. And Pharao ſent to wete: but ther was not one of the catell of the Iſrahelites dead. Notwithſtondinge the hert of Pharao hardened, and he wolde not let the people goo.
                  And the Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes and Aaron: take youre handes full of aſſhes out of the

fornace, and let Moſes ſprynkel it vp in to the ayre in the ſyghte of Pharao, and it ſhall turne to duſt in all the londe of Egipte, and ſhal make ſwellynge ſoores with blaynes both on mā and beeſt in all the londe of Egipte. And they toke aſſhes out of the fornace, and ſtode before Pharao, ād Moſes ſprynkeld it vp in to the ayre: And there brake out ſoores with blaynes both in mā and beeſt: ſo that the ſorcerers coude not ſtonde before Moſes, by the reaſon of botches on the enchaunters and apon all the Egiptians, But the Lorde hardened the herte of Pharao, that he herkened not vnto them, as the Lorde had ſayde vnto Moſes.
                  And the Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes: ryſe vp early in the mornynge and ſtonde before Pharao and tell him, thus ſayth the Lorde God of the Ebrues: Let my people goo, that they may ſerue me, or els I will at this tyme ſende all my plages apon thine herte and apon thy ſervauntes and on thy people, that thou mayſt knowe that there is none lyke me in all the erth. For now I will ſtretch out my hande and will ſmyte the and thy people with peſtilence: ſo that thou ſhalt periſſhe from the erth. Yet in very dede for this cauſe haue I ſterred the vpp, for to ſhewe my power in the, and to declare my name thorow out all the worlde.
                  
                     Yf it be ſo that thou ſtoppeſt my people, that thou wilt not let them goo: beholde, tomorow this tyme I will ſend doune a mightie great hayle: euē ſoch one as was not in Egipte ſence it was grounded vnto this tyme. Sende therfore and fet home thy beeſtes and al that thou haſt in the felde, For apon all the men and beeſtes which are founde in the felde ād not broughte home, ſhall the hayle fall, ād they ſhall dye And as many as feared the worde of the Lorde among the ſervauntes of Pharao made the ir ſervauntes ād their beeſtes flee to houſe: and they that regarded not the worde of the Lorde, left their ſervauntes and their beeſtes in the felde.
                  And the Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes: ſtretche forth thine hande vnto heauen, that there may be hayle in all the lande of Egipte: apō mā ād beeſt, ād apō all the herbes of the felde in the feld of Egipte. And Moſes ſtretched out his rodd vnto heauen, and the Lorde thondered and hayled ſo that the fyre ran a longe vppon the grounde. And the Lorde ſo hayled in the lōde of Egipte, that there was hayle ād fyre mē
                     gled with the hayle, ſo greuous, that there was none ſoch in all the londe of Egipte, ſence people inhabited it.
                  And the hayle ſmote in the londe of Egipte

all that was in the felde: both man and beeſt And the hayle ſmote all the herbes of the feld and broke all the trees of the felde: only in the lande of Goſan where the children of iſraell were, was there no hayle. And Pharao ſent ād called for Moſes and Aaron, and ſayde vnto thē: I haue now ſynned, the Lorde is rightwes and I and my people are weked. Praye ye vnto the Lorde, that the thonder of God and hayle maye ceaſe, and I will let you goo, and ye ſhall tarie no longer.
                  And Moſes ſayde vnto him: aſſoone as I am out of the citie, I will ſprede abrode my handes vnto the Lorde, and the thunder ſhall ceaſſe, nether ſhall there be any moare hayle: that thou mayſt knowe, howe that the erth ys the Lordes, But I knowe that thou and thy ſervauntes yet feare not the Lord God. The flaxe ād the barly were ſmyttē, for the barly was ſhott vp ād the flaxe was boulled: but the where and the rye were not ſmeten, for they were late ſowne.
                  And Moses went out of the citie frō Pharao ād ſprede abrode his handes vnto the Lorde, and the thunder and hayle ceaſed, nether rayned it any moare vppon the erth. whē Pharao ſawe that the rayne and the hayle and thunder were ceaſed, he ſynned agayn ād hardened

his herte: both he and his ſervauntes So was the herte of Pharao hardened, that he wolde not let the children of Iſrael goo, as the Lord had ſayde by Moſes.
               
               
                  ¶ The .x. Chapter.
                  THe Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes: goo vnto Pharao, neuertheleſſe I haue hardened his harte and the hertes of his ſervauntes, that I mighte ſhewe theſe my ſygnes amongeſt thē and that thou tell in the audience of thy ſonne and of thy ſonnes ſonne, the pagiantes which I haue played in Egipte ād the miracles which I haue done amonge them: that ye may knowe how that I am the Lorde.
                  Than Moſes ād Aaron went in vnto Pharao and ſayde vnto him: thus ſayth the Lorde God of the Hebrues: how longe ſhall it be, or thou wilt ſubmyt thy ſelfe vnto me? Let my people goo that they maye ſerue me. Yf thou wilt not let my people goo: beholde, tomorow will I brynge greſhoppers in to thy lande, and they ſhall couer the face of the erth that it can not be ſene, ād they ſhall eate the reſidue which remayneth vnto you and eſcaped the hayle and they ſhall eate all youre grene trees vpon the felde, and they ſhall fill thy houſſes and all thy ſervauntes houſſes, and the houſſes of all the Egiptiās after ſoch a maner: as nether thy

fathers nor thy fathers fathers haue ſene, ſence the tyme they were apon the erthe vnto thys daye. And he turned him ſilfe aboute, ād went out from Pharao.
                  And Pharaos ſervauntes ſayde vnto hym: Howe longe ſhall this felowe thus plage vs? Let the men goo that they maye ſerue the Lorde their God, or els wilt thou ſee Egipte firſt deſtroyed? And than Moſes and Aaron were broughte agayn vnto Pharao, and he ſayde vnto them: Goo and ſerue the Lorde youre God but who are they that ſhall goo? And Moſes anſwered: we muſt goo with yonge and olde: ye and with oure ſonnes and with oure doughters, ād with oure ſhepe and oxē muſt we goo For we muſt holde a feaſt vnto the Lorde.
                  And he ſayde vnto them: ſhall it be ſoo? The Lorde be with you, ſhulde I lett you goo, and youre children alſo? Take heede, for ye haue ſo me myſchefe in honde. Nay not ſo: but goo ye that are men and ſerue the Lorde, for that was youre deſyre. And they thruſt thē out of Pharaos preſence.
                  And the Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes: Stretch out thine hande ouer the lande of Egipte for greſhoppers, that they come apon the lande of Egipte and eate all the herbes of the londe, ād all that the hayle left vntouched. And Moſes

ſtretched forth his rodd ouer the londe off Egipte, ād the Lorde brought an eaſt wynde vppō the lande, all that daye and all nyghte. And in the mornynge the eaſt wynde broughte the greſhoppers, ād the greſhoppers wēt vp ouer all the lande of Egipte and lighted in all quarters off Egipte verye greuouſly: ſo that before them were there no ſoch greſhoppers, nether after them ſhal be. And they couered all the face of the erth, ſo that the londe was darke therwith. And they ate all the herbes of the lande and all the frutes of the trees which the hayle had lefte: ſo that there was no grene thinge lefte in the trees and herbes of the felde thorow all the lande of Egipte.
                  Then Pharao called for Moſes and Aarō in haſte and ſayde: I haue ſynned agaynſt the Lorde youre God and agaynſt you. Forgeue me yet my ſynne only this once, and pray vnto the Lorde youre God that he maye take away frō me this deth only. And he wēt out frō Pharao ād prayd vnto the Lorde, ād the Lord turned the wynde in to a myghtie ſtronge weſt wynde, and it toke awaye the greſhoppers and caſt thē in to the reed ſee: ſo that there was not one greſhopper left in all the coſtes of Egipte But the Lorde hardened Pharaos herte,

And Moſes ſtretched forth his hande vnto heauē, ād there was a darke myſt vppō all the lande off Egipte. iij dayes longe ſo that no mā ſawe another nether roſe vp frō the place where he was by the ſpace of .iij. dayes, but all the childrē of Iſrael had lighte where they dwelled.
                  Then Pharao called for Moſes and ſayde: goo and ſerue the Lorde, only let youre ſhepe. and youre oxen abyde, but let youre childern go with you. And Moſes anſwered: thou muſt geue vs alſo offringes and burntoffringes for to ſacrifice vnto the Lord oure God, Oure ca tell therfore ſhall goo with vs, and there ſhall not one hooſ

                  But the Lorde hardened Pharaos herte, ſo that he wold not let thē goo. And Pharao ſayde vnto him: get the frō me ād take heade to thy ſelfe that thou ſee my face no moare, For whē ſoeuer thou comeſt in my ſyghte, thou ſhalt dye. And Moſes ſaide: let it be as thou haſt ſayde: I will ſee thy face no moare.

                  And Moſes ſayde: thus ſayth the Lorde. Aboute mydnyghte will I goo out amonge the Egiptians, and all the firſtborne in the land of Egipte ſhall dye: euen from the firſtborne off Pharao that ſitteth on his ſeate, vnto the firſtborne of the maydeſervaunte that is in the mylle, and all the firſtborne of the catell.

And among all the childern of Iſrael ſhall not a dogg move his tongue, nor yet man or beeſt: that ye may knowe, how the Lorde putteth a difference betwene the Egiptiās and Iſrael.

                  And he called vnto Moſes and Aaron by nyghte ſaynge: Ryſe vp and gett you out from amonge my people: both ye and alſo the children of Iſrael, and goo and ſerue the Lorde as ye haue ſayde. And take youre ſhepe and your oxen with you as ye haue ſayde, ād departe ād bleſſe me alſo. And the Egiptians were ferce vppon the people and made haſte to ſend thē out of the lād: for they ſayde: we be al deed mē And the people toke the dowe before it was ſowered which they had in ſtoare, and bounde it in clothes ād put it vpō their ſhulders And the childern of Iſrael dyd acordinge to the ſaynge of Moſes: ād they borowed of the Egiptians: iewels of ſyluer, and iewels of gold, and rayment. And the Lorde gat the people fauoure in the ſyghte of the Egiptians: ād ſo they borowed and robbed the Egiptians.

                  when Pharao had let the people goo, God caried them not thorow the londe of the Philiſtines, though it were a nye waye. For God ſayde: the people myghte happly repent when they ſe warre, and ſo turne agayne to Egipte: therfore God led thē aboute thorow the wylderneſſe that bordreth on the redd ſee.

                  And whē it was tolde the kynge of Egipte that the people fled, thā Pharaos harte and all his ſeruaūtes turned vnto the people ād. ſayde why haue we this done, that we haue let Iſrael go out of oure ſeruyce? and he made redie his charettes ād toke his people with hym ād toke vi. hūdred choſen charettes ād all the charettes of Egipte ād captaynes vppō all his people.

                  Thā ſayde they vnto Moſes? were there no* graues for us in Egipte, but thou muſt bringe us awaye for to dye in the wylderneſſe? wherfore haſt thou ſerued us thus, for to carie us out of Egipte? Dyd not we tell the this in Egipte ſaynge, let us be in reſt and ſerue the Egiptians? For it had bene better for us to haue ſerued the Egiptians, than for to dye in the wilderneſſe. And Moſes ſayde vnto the people: feare ye not but ſtonde ſtill and beholde how the Lorde ſhall ſaue you this daye: For as ye ſe the Egiptians this daye, ſhall ye ſee them nomore for euer till the worldes ende. The Lorde ſhall fighte for you and ye ſhall holde youre peace.
                  The Lorde ſayde vnto Moſes: wherfore crieſt thou vnto me? ſpeake vnto the childern of Iſrael that they goo forwarde. But lifte thou vp thi rodd and ſtretch out thi hande ouer the ſee and deuyde it a ſondre, that

the childern of Iſrael may goo on drye groū

And I will gett me honoure vpon Pharao and vpon all his hoſte, vpon his charettes ād vpon his horſe mē. And the Egiptians ſhall knowe that I am the Lord whan I haue gotten me honoure vpō Pharao vpon his charettes and vpon his horſemen.
                  And the angell of God which went before the hoſte of Iſrael, remoued ād went behinde them. And the cloudēpiler that was before them remoued ād ſtode behinde them ād wēt betwene the hoſte of the Egiptians ād the hoſte of Iſrael. Yt was a darke clowde, and gaue lighte by nyghte: ſo that all the nyghte long the one coude not come at the other.
                  when now Moſes ſtretched forth his honde ouer the ſee, the Lorde caried awaye the ſee with a ſtronge eaſt wynde that blewe all nyghte, and made the ſee drie londe ād the water deuyded it ſilfe. And the childern of Iſrael went in thorow the myddeſt of the ſee vppon the drie grounde. And the water was a walle vnto them, both on their righthande ād on the ir lefte hande. And the Egiptians folowed ād went in after them to the myddeſt of the ſee, with all Pharaos horſes, and his charettes and

his horſſemen.
                  And in the mornynge watch, the Lorde loked vnto the hoſte of the Egiptiās out of the fyery and clowdie piler, and troubled their hoſte and ſmote of their charett wheles and caſt them doune to the grounde. Than ſayde the Egiptians: Let vs fle from Iſrael, for the Lorde fyghteth for them agaynſt vs. Than ſayde the Lorde vnto Moſes: ſtretch out thine hand ouer the ſee, that the water maye come agayne vppō the Egiptians vppon their charettes ād horſemen.

                  And he made a braſen gredyren of networke vnto the alter rounde aboute alowe beneth vnder the compaſſe of the alter: ſo that it reached vnto halfe the altare, and caſt .iiij. rynges of braſſe for the .iiij. endes of the gredyren to put ſtaues in. And he made ſtaues of ſethim wodd and couered them with braſſe, and put the ſtaues in the rynges alonge by the alter ſyde

                  And he made the lauer of braſſe and the fo te of it alſo of braſſe, in the ſyghte of them that dyd watch before the dore of the tabernacle of witneſſe.

And on the north ſyde the hanginges were an hundred cubettes longe with .xx. pilers and .xx. ſokettes of braſſe, but the knoppes and the whopes of the pilers were of ſyluer. And on the weſt ſyde, were hangynges of .l. cubettes longe, and .x. pilers with their .x. ſokettes, and the knoppes ād the whoopes of the pilers were ſyluer. And on the eaſt ſyde towarde the ſonne ryſynge, were hangynges of .l. cubettes: the hangynges of the one ſyde of the gate were .xv. cubettes longe, and their pilers .iij. with their. iij, ſokettes. And off the other ſyde of the court gate, were hanginges alſo of .xv. cubettes longe and their pilers iii. with .iij. ſokettes. Now all the hanginges of the courte rounde aboute, were of twyned byſſe, ād the ſokettes of the pilers were braſſe: but the knoppes ād the whoopes of the pilers were

And the hanginge of the gate of the courte was nedleworke: of Iacincte, ſcarlet, purple, and twyned byſſe .xx. cubettes longe and fiue in the bredth, acordynge to the hangynges of the courte. And the pilers were .iiij. with .iiij. ſokettes of braſſe, ād the knoppes of ſyluer, ād the heedes ouerlayde with ſyluer and whoped aboute with ſyluer, ād all the pynnes of the tabernacle ād of the courte rounde aboute were braſſe.
                  This is the ſumme of the habitacyō of witneſſe, whiche was counted at the commaundment of Moſes: and was the office of the Leuites by the hande of Ithamar ſonne to Aaron the preaſt.

                  Thus was the tabernacle reared vp the firſt moneth in the ſecōde yere. And Moſes rered vp the tabernacle ād faſtened his ſokettes, ād ſet vp the bordes ād put in their barres, ād rered vp the pillers, ād ſpred abrode the tēt ouer the habitaciō ād put the coueringe of the tent an hye aboue it: as the Lorde commaunded Moſes.

And yf the clowde departed not, they iornayed nott till it departed: for the clowde of the Lorde was apon the habitacion by daye, and fyre by nyghte: in the ſighte of all the houſe of Iſrael in all their iornayes.

                  THe ceremonies which are deſcribed in the boke folowinge, were cheflye ordined off God, (as I ſayde in the ende of the prologe vppon Exodi) to occupye the mindes of that people the Iſraelites, and to kepe them from ſervinge of God after the imaginacyon of their blinde zele and good entent: that their conſcience
                     •
                   might be ſtabliſhed and they ſure that they pleaſed God therein, which were impoſſible, yf a man did of his awne heed that which was not commaunded of God nor depēded of any appoyntement made betwene him and God. Soch ceremonies were vnto them as an A. B .C. to lerne to ſpelle and read, and as a nurce to fede them with milke and pappe, and to ſpeake vnto them after their awne capacyte and to liſpe the wordes unto them acording as the babes and childern of that age might ſounde them agayne. For all that were before Chriſt were in the infancye and childhod of the worlde and ſawe that ſonne which we ſe openlye, but thorowe a cloude and had but feble and

weake imaginacions of Chriſt, as childern haue of mennes deades, a fewe prophetes excep

                   whiche yet deſcribed him vnto other in ſacrifices and ceremonies, likeneſſes, rydles, prouerbes, and darke and ſtraunge ſpeakinge vntyil the full age were come that God wold ſhewe him openlye vnto the whole worlde and delyuer them from their ſhadowes and cloudelight and the hethen out of their dead ſlepe of ſtarcke blinde ignorancye. And as the ſhadowe vaniſheth awaye at the comynge of the light, euen ſo doo the ceremonyes and ſacrifices at the comynge of Chriſt, and are henceforth no moare neceſſarye then a token left in remembraunce of a bargayne is neceſſary whē the bargayne is fulfilled. And though they ſ

For all be it that ſoch phantaſyes be permytted to ſatiſfie the childers luſtes, yet in that they are the mothers gifte and be done in place and tyme at hir cō
                  maundement, they kepe the childern in awe and make them knowe the mother and alſo make them more apte agenſte a more ſtronger age to obaye in thinges of greater

                  rneſte.
               
                  And moraouer though ſacrifices and ceremonies can be no ground or fundacion to bild apon: that is, though we can proue noughte with them: yet when we haue once ſound oute Chriſt and his miſteries, then we maye borow figures, that is to ſaye allegoryes, ſimilitudes or examples to open Chriſt and the ſecrettes off God hyd in Chriſt euen vnto the quycke, and to declare them more lyuely and ſenſebly with them than with all the wordes of the worlde. For ſimilitudes haue more vertue and power with them than bare wordes, and lead a mans wittes further in to the pithe and marye and ſpirituall vnderſtondinge of the thinge, than all the wordes that can be imagined. And though alſo that all the ceremonies and ſacrifices haue as it were a ſlerrelyght of Chriſt, yet ſome there be that haue as it were the lighte of the brode daye a litle before the ſonne riſinge, and expreſſe him, and the circumſtaunces and vertue of his deth ſo playnly as if we ſhulde playe his paſſyon on a ſcaffold or in a ſtage play opē
                  lye before the eyes of the people. As the ſcape gote, the braſen ſerpent, the oxe burnt without the hoſte▪ the paſſeouerlambe &c. In ſo moch that I am fully perſuaded and can not but beleue that God had ſhewed Moſes the ſecrettes of Chriſt and the verey maner of his deth before

hande, and commaunded him to ordene them for the confirmacion of oure faythes whiche are now in the cleare daye light. And I beleue alſo that the prophetes whiche folowed Moſes to confirme his propheſyes and to mayntayne his doctrine vnto Chriſtes cominge, were moued by ſoch thinges to ſerche further of Chriſtes ſecrettes. And though God wold not haue the ſecrettes of Chriſt generallye knowne, ſaue vnto a few familier frendes which in that infancye he made of mans witte to helpe the other babes: yet as they had a generall promyſſe that one of the ſeed of Abrahā ſhuld come and bleſſe them, euen ſo they had a generall fayth that God wold by the ſame man ſaue them, though they wiſt not by what meanes as the very apoſtles when it was oft told them yet they coude neuer comprehend it, till it was fufilled in deade.
               And beyonde all this their ſacrifices ād ceremonies as farforth as the promyſes annexed vnto them extende / ſo farforth they ſaued thē and iuſtified them and ſtode them in the ſame ſteade as oure ſacramentes doo vs: not by the power of the ſacrifice or deade it ſelfe, but by the vertue of the faith in the promyſſe whiche the ſacrifice or ceremonye preached and wherof it was a token or ſygne. For the ceremonies

and ſacrifices were lefte with them and commaunded them to kepe the promyſſe in remē
                  braunce and to wake vpp their fayth. As it is not ynough to ſende manye on errandes and to tell them what they ſhall doo: but they muſt haue a remembraunce with them, and it be but a ringe of a ruſh aboute one of their fingers. And as it is not ynough to make a bargayne with wordes onlye, but we muſt put thereto an oth and geue erneſt to confirme the faithe off the perſon with whom it is made. And in like maner yf a man promyſſe, what ſoeuer trifull it be, it is not beleued excepte he hold vppe his finger alſo, ſoch is the wekeneſſe of the world. And therfore chriſt him ſilf vſed oftymes diuerſe ceremonyes in curynge the ſ
                     •
                  ke, to ſturre vpp their faith with all. As for an 
                     •
                  nſample it was not the bloud of the lambe that ſaued thē in Egipte, when the angell ſmote the Egiptians: but the mercye of God and his truth wherof that bloude was a token and remembraunce to ſturre vppe their faythes wyth all. For though God make a promyſſe, yet it ſaueth none finallye but them that longe for it and praye God with a ſtronge fayth to fulfill it for his mercye and truthe onlye and knowlege theyr vnworthyneſſe. And euen ſo oure ſacramentes

(yf they be truelye miniſtred) preach Chriſt vnto vs and leade oure faythes vnto Chriſt, by which faithe oure ſynnes are done awaye and not by the deade or worke of the ſacrament.

                  y it and that deade of preachinge thorow fayth doth put awaye my ſynnes. For the holy goſt is no dome god nor no god that goeth a mummige. Yf a man ſaye of the ſacrament of Chriſtes bodye ād bloud that it is a ſacrifice as well for the dead as for the quycke and therfore the very deed it ſelf iuſtifieth and putteth awaye ſynne. I anſwere that a ſacrifice is the ſleynge off the body of a beeſt or a man: wherfore yf it be a ſacrifice, then is chriſtes body there ſlayne ād his bloude there ſhed: but that is not ſo. And therfore it is properly no ſacrifice but a ſacrament and a memoriall of that euerlaſtinge ſacrifice once for all which he offered apon the croſſe now apon a .xv. hundred yeres a go and preacheth only vnto them that are alyue. And as for them that be dead, it is as profitable vnto them as is a candell in a lantrene without light vnto them that walke by the waye in a darke night, and as the goſpell ſong in laten is vnto them that vnderſtond none at all, and as a ſermon preached to him that is dead and hereth it not. It preacheth vnto them that are a lyue only, for they that be dead, yf they dyed in the faith which that ſacrament preacheth, they

For when they were alyue their hartes loued the lawe off God and therfore ſynned not, and were ſory that their membres ſynned and euer moued to ſynne, and therfore thorow faith it was forgeuen them. And now their ſynnefull membres be dead, ſo that they can now ſynne no more, wherfore it is vnto them that be dead nether ſacrament nor ſacrifice: But vnder the pretence of their ſoule health it is a ſervaunt vnto oure ſpiritualtyes holy coue

               Some man wold happely ſaye, that the prayers of the maſſe helpe moch: not the lyuinge only, but alſo the dead. Of the hote fire of their farvent prayer which conſumeth faſter then all the world is able to bringe ſacrifice, I haue ſayde ſufficiently in other places. Howe be it it is not poſſible to bringe me in beleffe that the prayer which helpeth h

                   awne maſter vnto no vertue, ſhuld purcheſſe me the forgeueſſe of my ſynnes. If I ſawe that their prayers had obtayned thē grace to lyue ſoch a liffe as goddes worde did not rebuke, then coud I ſone be borne in hande that what ſoeuer they axed off

God their prayers ſhuld not be in vayne. But now what good can he wyſh me in his prayers that envieth me Chriſt the fode and the liffe of my ſoule? What good can he wiſh me whoſe herte cleaveth a ſundre for payne when I am taught to repent of my euell?
               Forthermore becauſe that fewe knowe the vſe of the olde teſtament, and the moſte parte thinke it nothinge neceſſarye but to make alle goryes, which they fayne euery mā after hys awne brayne at all wyle advēture without any certayne rule: therfore (though I haue ſpoken off them in another place) yet leſt the boke come not to all mennes handes that ſhall reade this, I will ſpeake off them here alſo a worde or twayne.
               We had nede to take hede euery where that we be not begyled with falſe allegories, whether they be drawne out of the new teſtament, or the olde, ether out of any other ſtorye or off the creatures of the worlde, but namely in this boke. Here a man had nede to put on all his ſpectacles and to arme him ſelfe agenſt inviſible ſpretes.
               Firſt allegories proue nothinge (and by allegories vnderſtonde examples or ſimilitudes borowed of ſtraunge matters and of another thinge than that thou entreateſt oft) As though

circumcyſyon be a figure of baptim, yet thou canſt not proue baptim by circumcyſion For this argumēt were verye feble, the Iſraelites were circūcyſed therfore we muſt be baptiſed. And in like maner though the offering of Iſaac were a figure or enſample oft the reſurrection, yet is this argument nought, Abraham wold haue offered Iſaac, but God delyuered him from deth, therfore we ſhall ryſe agayne, and ſo forth in all other.
               But the very vſe of allegories is to declare and open a texte that it maye be the better perceaved and vnderſtonde. As when I haue a cleare texte of Chriſt and of the apoſtles, that I muſt be baptyſed, then I maye borowe an enſample of circumcyſion to expreſſe the nature power and frute or effecte of baptim. For as circumcyſion was vnto them a comon bagge ſygnifienge that they were all ſodiars off God to warre his warre and ſeparatinge them from all other nacyons diſobedient vnto God: euen ſo baptim is oure comen bagge and ſure erneſt and perpetuall memoriall that we pertayne vnto Chriſt and are ſeparated from all that are not chriſtes. And as circumciſion was a token certifyenge them that they were receaved vnto the fauoure off God and theyr

ſinner forgeven them: even ſo baptim certefyeth vs that we are waſſhed in the bloude of chriſt ād receaued to fauoure for his ſake. and as circumcyſion ſignifyed vnto thē the cuttynge away of theyr awne luſtes and ſleynge of their fre will, as they call it, to folowe the will of god even ſo baptim ſignyfgeth vnto vs repentaunce and the mortefyinge of oure vnruly mēbres and body of ſynne, to walke in a new lyffe and ſo forth.
               And likewyſe though that the ſavinge of Noe and of them that were with him in the ſhyppe, thorow water, is a figure, that is to ſaye an enſample and likeneſſe of baptim, as Peter maketh it. 1. Petri 3. yet I can not proue baptim therwith, ſaue deſcribe it only. for as the ſheyppe ſaved thē in the water thorow faith, in that they beleved god and as the other that wold not beleve Noe peryſhed: even ſo baptim ſaveth vs thorow the worde of faith which it preacheth when all the world of the vnbelevinge peryſh. And Paule. 1. Corin. 10. maketh the ſee ād the cloude a figure of baptim, by which and a thouſand mo I might declare it but not proue it. Paule alſo in the ſayde place maketh the rocke out of which Moſes brought water vnto the childerne of Iſrael a figure or enſample of chriſt / not to proue chriſt (for that were impoſſible)

but to deſcribe chriſt only: even as chriſt hiſilf Iohānis. 3. boroweth a ſimilitude or figure of the braſen ſerpent to lead Nichodemus frō his erthy imaginacyon in to the ſpirituall vnderſtondinge of chriſt ſayenge: As Moſes lyftedvpp a ſerpent in the wilderneſſe, ſo muſt the ſonne of man be lifted vpp, that none that beleue in him peryſh but haue everlaſtinge liffe. by which ſimilitude the vertue of chriſtes deth is better deſcribed then thou coudeſt declare it with a thouſande wordes. for as thoſe murmurars agenſt god as ſone as they repented were healed of their deadly woundes thorow lokynge on the braſen ſerpent only without medicyne or any other helpe, yee ād without any other reaſon but that god hath ſayed it ſhuld be ſo / and not to murmoure agayne, but to leue their murmuringe: even ſo all that repent ād beleue in chriſt are ſaved from euerlaſtinge deth / of pure grace without and before their good workes / and not to ſynne agayne, but to fight agaynſt ſynne ād henceforth to ſynne no moare.
               Even ſo with the ceremonyes of this boke thou canſt prove nothinge ſaue deſcribe and declare only the puttyng awaye. of oure ſynnes thorow the deth of chriſt. for chriſt is Aaron and Aarons ſonnes and all that offer the ſacrifyce to purge ſynne, And chriſt is all mane

offering that is offered: he is the oxe, the ſhepe the gote, the kyd and lambe: he is the oxe that is burnt without the hoſt and the ſcape gote that caryed all the ſynne of the people awaye in to the wilderneſſe. for as they purged the people frō their wordly vnclenneſſes thorow bloud of the ſacrifices / even ſo doth chriſt purge vs from the vnclenneſſes of everlaſtinge deth with his awne bloude. and as their wordly ſynnes coude no otherwyſe be purged then by bloude of ſacrifyce / even ſo can oure ſynnes be no otherwyſe forgeven then thorow the bloude of chriſt. All the deades in the world, ſaue the bloude of chriſt, can purchaſe no forgeveneſſe of ſynnes: for oure deades do but helpe oure neyghboure and mortefye the fleſh ād helpe that we ſynne no moare / but and if we haue ſynned / it muſt be frely forgeven thorow the bloude of chriſt or remayne ever.
               And in lyke maner of the lepers thou canſt prove nothinge: thou canſt never coniure ou
                     •
                   confeſſiō thenſe, how be it thou haſt an handſome example there to open the bindinge and lowſinge of oure preaſtes with the kaye of goddes word▪ for as they made no man a lepre even ſo oures haue no power to commaunde any man to be in ſynne or to go to purgatory or hell. And therefore (in as moch as bindinge

and lowſinge is one power) As thoſe preaſtes healed no man / even ſo oures can not of their inviſeble and domme power dryve any mannes ſynnes awaye or delyver hym from hell or fayned purgatorye. how be it if they preached gods word purely which is the authorite that chriſt gaue them / then they ſhuld binde ād lowſe / kylle and make alyve agayne, make vncle 
                     •
                  ne and cleane agayne / and ſend to hell ād fett thence agayne / ſo mighty is gods word. for if they preached the lawe of god, they ſhuld bind the conſciences of ſynners with the bondes of the paynes of hell and bringe them vnto repē
                  taunce. And then if they preached them the mercye that is in chriſt / they ſhuld lowſe them and quiet their raginge conſciences and certefie them of the fauoure of god and that their ſynnes be forgeven.
               Fynallye beware of allegoryes / for there is not a moare handſome or apte a thinge to be gile withall then an allegorye / nor a more ſotle and peſtilent thinge in the world to perſuade a falſe mater then an allegorye. And contrary wyſe there is not a better / vehementer or myghtyer thinge to make a man vnderſtond with all then an allegory. For allegoryes make a man qwick witted and prynte wyſdome

in him and maketh it to abyde, to here bare wordes go but in at the one eare and out at the other. As this with ſoch like ſayenges: put ſalt to all youre ſacrifices, in ſteade of this ſentence, do all youre deades with diſcrecion, greteth and biteth (yf it be vnderſtond) moare thē playne wordes. And when I ſaye in ſteade off theſe wordes boſt not youre ſelf of your good deades, eate not the bloude nor the fatt of youre ſacrifice, there is as great differēce betwene them as there is diſtaunce betwene heauen ād erth. For the liffe and beutye of all good deades is of God and we are but the caren leane, we are onlye the inſtrument whereby god worketh only, but the power is his. As god created Paule a newe, poured hys wiſdome in to him, gaue him mighte and promyſed him that his grace ſhuld neuer fayle him &c. and all without deſervinges, excepte that nurteringe the ſayntes and makinge them curſe and rayle on Chriſt be meritorious. Now as it is death to eate the bloude or fatte of any ſacrifice, is it not (thinke ye) damnable to robbe god of his honoure and to gloryfye my ſelf with his honoure?

And let him put his hande apon the heed of the burntſacrifice, and fauoure ſhalbe geuen him to make an attonemēt for hym, ād let him kyll the oxe before the Lorde. And let the preaſtes Aarons ſonnes brynge the bloude and let them ſprinckell it rounde aboute apon the alter that is before the dore of the tabernacle of witneſſe, And let the burntoffrynges be ſtrypped and hewed in peces. And thē let the ſonnes of Aaron the preaſt put fire apō the alter and put wodd apon the fire, and let them laye the peces with the heed and the fatte, apon the wod that is on the fire in the alter.

But the inwardes ād the legges they ſhall waſh in water, and the preaſt ſhall burne altogither apon the alter, that it be a burntſacrifice, and an offerynge of a ſwete odoure vnto the Lorde.
                  Yf he will offer a burntſacrifice of the ſhepe whether it be of the lambes or of the gootes: he ſhall offer a male without blimeſh. And let him kyll it on the north ſyde of the alter, before the Lorde. And let the preaſtes Aarons ſonnes ſprinkle the bloude of it, rounde aboute apon the alter. And let it be cut in peces: euen with his heed and his fatte, and let the preaſt putte them apon the wodd that lyeth apon the fire in the alter. But let him waſh the inwardes and the legges with water, and than bringe altogether and burne it apon the alter: that is a burntoffrynge and a ſacrifice of ſwete ſauoure vnto the Lorde.
                  Yf he will offer a burntoffrynge of the foules he ſhall offer eyther of the turtyll doues or of the ionge pigeons. And the preaſt ſhall brynge it vnto the alter, and wrynge the necke a ſundre of it, and burne it on the alter, and let the bloude runne out apon the ſydes of the alter, ād plucke awaye his croppe ād his fethers, ād caſt thē beſyde the alter on the eaſt parte vppō the hepe of aſſhes, ād breke his winges but

For yf any of the fleſh of the peaceoffrynges be eaten the thirde daye then ſhall he that offered it optayne no fauour, nether ſhall it be rekened vnto him: but ſhalbe an abhomynacion, and the ſoule that eateth of it ſhall beare the ſynne thereof.

What ſoeuer ſoule it be that eateth any maner of bloude the ſame ſoule ſhal periſſhe frō his people.

And the preaſt ſhall burne the fatt apon the alter, ād the breſt ſhalbe Aarōs ād his ſonnes. And the right ſhulder they ſhall geue vnto the preaſt, to be an heueoffrynge, of their peaceoffringes. And the ſame that offreth the bloud of the peaceoffringes ād the fatt, amōg the ſōnes of Aarō, ſhall haue the right ſhulder vnto his parte, for the wauebreſt ād the heueſhulder I haue takē of the childern of Iſrael, euen of their peace offringes, ād haue geuē it vnto Aarō the preſt and vnto his ſonnes: to be a dutie for euer of

This is the lawe of burntoffrynges, of meatoffrynges, of ſynne offrynges, of treſpaceoffrynges, of full offrynges, of peaceoffrynges, which the Lorde commaunded Moſes in the mount of Sinai, in the daye when he commaunded the childern of Iſrael to offer their offrynges vnto the Lorde in the wilderneſſe of Sinai.

And Moſes dyd as the Lorde commaunded him, and the people gathered them ſelues togither vnto the doore of the tabernacle of witneſſe. And Moſes ſayde vnto the people: this is the thinge which the Lorde commaunded to do.

And he toke all the fatt that was apon the inwardes ād the kal that was on the lyuer ād the two kydneyes with their fatt ād burned it apō the alter. But the oxe, the hide, his fleſh ād his donge, he burnt with fire without the hoſte, as the Lorde commaunded Moſes.

That was a burntſacrifice of a ſwete ſauoure ād an offrynge vnto the Lorde, as the Lorde cōmaunded Moſes.

And thā Moſes toke thē from of their handes agayne ād burnt thē apō the alter, euen apon the burntoffrynge: Theſe are the fulloffrynges of a ſwete ſauoure ād a ſacrifice vnto the Lorde.
                  And Moſes toke the breſte and waued it a waueoffrynge before the Lorde, of the ram of the fuloffrynges: ād it was Moſes parte, as the Lorde commaunded Moſes.
                  And Moſes toke of the anoynting oyle ād of the bloude whiche was apon the alter, and ſprinkled it apō Aarō ād apon his veſtimētes ād apō his ſōnes ād on their veſtimētes with hī ād ſanctified Aarō ād his veſturs ād his ſōnes

Then Moſes ſay de vnto Aaron and his ſonnes: boyle the fleſh in the doore of the tabernacle of witneſſe, and there eate it with the bred that is in the baſket of fullofferynges, as the Lorde commaunded ſayenge. Aaron and his ſonnes ſhall eate it: ād that whiche remayneth of the fleſh and of the brede, burne with fire.
                  And ſe that ye departe not from the doore of the tabernacle of witneſſe ſeuen dayes longe: vntill the dayes of youre fullofferynges be at an ende. For .vij. dayes muſt youre hādes be filled, as they were this daye: euē ſo the Lorde hath commaūded to do, to reconcyle you with all. Se therfore that ye abyde in the dore of the tabernacle of witneſſe daye and nyghte ſeuen dayes longe: and kepe the watch of the Lorde that ye dye not: for ſo I am commaunded.

And let the preaſt ſe it: and yf the ryſynge of the ſore be reddyſhwhite in his baulde

heade or foreheade after the maner of a leproſye in the ſkynne of the fleſh, then he is a leper and vncleane: ād the preaſt ſhall make him vncleane, for the plage of his heede.
                  And the leper in whome the plage is / ſhall haue his clothes rent and his heade bare ād his mouth moffeld, and ſhalbe called vncleane. And as longe as the dyſeaſe leſteth apon him, he ſhalbe vncleane: for he is vncleane, and ſhall therfore dwell alone, ād even without the hoſt ſhall his habitacion be.
                  When the plage of leproſye is in a cloth: whether it be lynen or wollen, yee and whether it be in the warpe or wolfe of the lynen or of the wollen: ether in a ſkynne or any thinge made of ſkynne / yf the diſeaſe be pale or ſomwhat redyſh in the cloth or ſkynne: whether it be in the warpe or wolfe or any thinge that is made of ſkynne, thē it is a very leproſye and muſt be ſhewed vnto the preaſt. And whē the preaſt ſeeth the plage, let him ſhutt it vpp .vij. dayes, and let him loke on the plage the ſeuenth daye. yf it be increaſed in the cloth: whether it be in the warpe or wolfe or in a ſkynne or in any thynge that is made of ſkynne, then the plage is a fretynge leproſye and it is vncleane: And that cloth ſhalbe burnt, ether warpe or wolfe, whether it be wollen or lynen or any thynge that is made of ſkynne where in the plage is, for it is a fretynge

leproſye / and ſhalbe burnt in the fyre.
                  Yf the preaſt ſe that the plage hath freten no further in the cloth: ether in the warpe or wolfe or in what ſoeuer thynge of ſkynne it be, then let the preaſt cōmaunde thē to waſſhe the thynge wherein the plage is, and let him ſhutt it vpp vij. dayes moo. And let the preaſt loke on it agayne after that the plage is waſſhed: Yf the plage haue not chaunged his faſcion though it be ſpred no further abrode, it is yet vncleane. And ſe that ye burne it in the fyre, for it is fretē in warde: whether in parte or in all together. But and yf the preaſt ſe that it is ſomwhat blackyſhafter that it is waſſhed, let him rent it out of the clothe, or out of the ſkynne or out of the warpe or wolfe. But and yf it apeare any moare in the cloth ether in the warpe or in the wolfe or in any thynge made of ſkynne / than it is a waxynge plage. And ſe that ye burne that with fyre, where in the plage is. Moreouer the cloth ether warpe or wolfe or what ſoeuer thinge of ſkynne it be which thou haſt waſſhed and the plage be departed from it, ſhalbe waſſhed once agayne: and then it is cleane.
                  This is the lawe of the plage of leproſye in a cloth whether it be wollē or lynen: eyther whether it be in the warpe or wolfe or in any thynge made of ſkynnes, to make it cleane or vncleane.
               
               
                  
                  ANd the Lorde ſpake vnto Moſes ſaynge: this is the lawe of a leper when he ſhalbe clēſed. he ſhalbe broughte vnto the preaſt, and the preaſt ſhall goo out without the hoſte and loke apō him. Yf the plage of leproſye be healed in the leper, thē ſhall the preaſt commaunde that there be brought for hī that ſhalbe clenſed .ij. lyuynge byrdes that are cleane, ād cipreſſe wodd, and a pece of purple cloth and yſope. And the preaſt ſhall cōmaunde that one of the byrdes be kylled ouer an erthē veſſell of runnynge water. And the preaſt ſhall take the lyuynge byrde and the cypreſſe wodd and the purple ād the yſope, ād ſhall dyppe thē and the lyuynge byrde in the bloude of the ſlayne byrde and in the rēnynge water and ſprinkle it apon him that muſt be clenſed of his leproſye .vij. tymes and clenſe him / and ſhall let the lyuynge byrde goo fre in to the feldes.
                  And he that is clēſed ſhall waſſhe his clothes and ſhaue off all his heer ād waſſhe himſelfe in water, and thē he is cleane. And after that he ſhall come in to the hoſte / but ſhall tarye without his tēt .vij. dayes. Whē the ſeuenth daye is come, he ſhall ſhaue off al his heer both apō his heade ād his berde ād on his browes: ād euē all the heer that is on him, ſhalbe ſhauen off. And he ſhall waſſhe his clothes and his fleſh in water / and then he ſhalbe cleane.
                  
                     And when the .viij. daye is come, let him take ij. lambes without blemyſh and a yewelambe of a yere olde without blemyſh, and .iij. tenthdeales of fyne floure for a meatofferynge myngled with oyle, and a logge of oyle. Than let the preaſt that maketh him cleane, brynge the man that is made cleane with thoſe thynges before the Lorde vnto the dore of the tabernacle of witneſſe. And lett the preaſt take one of the lā
                     bes and offer him for a treſpaceofferynge, and the logge of oyle: and waue them before the Lorde. And than let him ſlee the lambe in the place where the ſynofferynge and the burntofferynge are ſlayne: euē in the holy place. for as the ſynofferynge is, euē ſo is the treſpace offerynge the preaſtes: for it is moſt holy.
                  Than lett the preaſt take of the bloude of the treſpaceofferynge, and put it apō the typpe of the right eare of him that is clenſed, and apon the thombe of his righte hande and apon the greate too of his righte fote. Then let the preaſt take of the logge of oyle and poure it in to the palme of his lefte hande, ād dippe his right finger in the oyle that is in the palme of his lefte hand, ād let him ſprinkle it with his fynger vij. tymes before the Lorde. And of the reſt of the oyle that is in his hande, ſhall the preaſt put apon the typpe of the righte eare of him that

And the remnaunte of the oyle that is in the preaſtes hande, he ſhall poure apon the heede off hym that is clenſed: and ſo ſhall the preaſte make an attonement for him before the Lorde,
                  Then let the preaſt offer the ſynneofferynge, ād make an attonement for him that is clenſed for his vnclēneſſe. And thā let the burntoffrynge be ſlayne, ād let the preaſt put both the burntofferynge and the meateoffrynge apō the alter: ād make an attonement for him, ād thā he ſhalbe cleane.
                  Yf he be poore ād can not gett ſo moch, thā let him bringe one lambe for a treſpaceoffrynge to waue it and to make an attonement for him, ād a tenth deale of fine floure myngled with oyle for a meatoffrynge ād a logge of oyle, ād two turtyll doues or two yonge pygeons which he is able to gett ād let the one be a ſynneoffrynge and the other a burntoffryng. And let him brynge them the. viij, daye for his clenſynge vnto the preaſt to the dore of the tabernacle of witneſſe before the Lorde.
                  And let the preaſt take the lambe that is the treſpaceoffrynge and the logge of oyle, ād waue

them before the Lorde. And whē the lambe of the treſpaceoffrynge is kylled, the preaſt ſhall take of the bloude of the treſpaceoffrynge, and put it apon the typpe of his righte eare that is clenſed, and apon the thombe of his righte hande, and apon the greate too of hys righte fote. And the preaſt ſhall poure of the oyle in to his righte hande, and ſhall ſprinkle with his finger of the oyle that is in his lefte hande .vij. tymes before the Lord.
                  And the preaſt ſhall put of the oyle that is in his hande (apon the typpe of the righte eare of h

                      that is clenſed, and apō the thombe of his righte hande and apon the great too of his righte fote: euen in the place where the bloude of the treſpaceofferynge was put, And the reſte of the oyle that is in his hande, he ſhall poure apon the heede of him that is clenſed: to make an attonemēt for him before the Lorde. And he ſhall offer one of the turtyll doues or of the yonge pigeons, ſoch as he can gett: the one for a ſynneofferynge and the other for a burntoffrynge apō the alter. And ſo ſhall the preaſt make an attonemēt for him that is clenſed before the Lorde. This is the lawe of him that hath the plage of leproſye, whoſe hand is not able to gett that which pertayneth to hys clenſynge.
                  
                     And the Lorde ſpake vnto Moſes ād Aarō ſaynge: when ye be come vnto the lond of Canaan which I geue you to poſſeſſe: yf I put the plage of leproſye in any houſſe of the lande of youre poſſeſſion, let him that oweth the houſe go ād tell the preaſt ſaynge, me thinke that there is as it were a leproſy in the houſſe. And the preaſt ſhall cōmaunde them to ryd all thinge out of the houſſe, before the preaſte goo in to ſe the plage: that he make not all that is in the houſſe vncleane, and then the preaſt ſhall goo in and ſe the houſſe.
                  Yf the preaſt ſe that the plage is in the walles of the houſſe ād that there be holowe ſtrakes pale or rede which ſeme to be lower than the other partes of the wall, then let the preaſt go out at the houſſe dores ād ſhett vp the houſſe for .vij. dayes. And let the preaſt come againe the ſeuenth daye ād ſe it: yf the plage be encreaſed in the walles of the houſſe, let the preaſt cōmaunde thē to take awaye the ſtones in which the plage is, ād let thē caſt thē in a foule place without the citie, ād ſcrape the houſe within rounde aboute, ād poure out the duſt without the citie in a foule place. And let them take other ſtones and put them in the places of thoſe ſtones, and other morter: ād playſter the houſſe with all.

Yf now the plage come agayne ād breake out in the houſſe, after that they haue taken awaye the ſtones and ſcraped the houſſe, and after that the houſſe is playſterd anew: let the preaſt come and ſe it. And yf then he perceaue that the plage hath eatē further in the houſſe, then it is a fretynge leproſye that is in the houſſe ād it is vncleane. Then they ſhall breake doune the houſſe: both ſtones, tymbre ād all the morter of the houſſe, and carye it out of the citye vnto a foule place. Moreouer he that goeth into the houſſe all the whyle that it is ſhett vp, ſhalbe vncleane vntyll nighte. And he that ſlepeth in the houſſe ſhall waſſhe his clothes, and he alſo that eateth in the houſſe ſhall waſſhe hys clothes.
                  But and yf the preaſt come and ſe that the plage hath ſprede no futher in the houſſe after that it is new playſterd, thē let him make it cleane for the plage is healed. And let him take to clenſe the houſſe with all: two birdes, cypreſſe wodd, ād purple clothe ād yſope. And let him kyll one of the byrdes ouer an erthen veſſel of runnynge water, ād take the cipreſſe wodd, the yſope, the purple ād the lyuynge byrde, ād dyppe them in the bloude of the ſlayne byrde and in the runninge water, and ſprinkle apon the houſſe ſeuen tymes, and clenſe the houſſe with

the bloude of the byrde, and with the runninge water, ād with the lyuyng byrde, ād with the cypreſſe wodd, ād the yſope ād the purple clothe And he ſhall lett the lyuynge byrde flee oute off the towne in to the wylde feldes, and ſo make an attonement for the houſſe, and it ſhal be cleane.
                  This is the lawe of all maner plage of leproſye and breakynge out, and of the leproſye off clothe and houſſe: and of ryſynges, ſcabbes and glyſterynge white, to teache when a thinge is vncleane or cleane. This is the lawe off leproſye.

Euery couche whereon he lyeth ād euery thinge whereon he ſytteth ſhalbe vncleane

For I will appeareBy the cloud vnderſtonde the ſmoke off the cence. in a clowde vpon the mercyſeate.
                  But of this maner ſhall Aaron goo in in to the holy place: with a yonge oxe for a ſynneofferynge, and a ram for a burntoffrynge. And he ſhall put the holy lynen albe apon him, ād ſhall haue a lynen breche vppon his fleſh, and ſhall gyrde him with a lynen gyrdell, and put the lynen mytre apon his heede: for they are holy ray mentes. And he ſhall waſſhe his fleſh with water, and put them on. And he ſhall take of the multitude of the childern of Iſrael two gootes for a ſynneoffrynge and a ram for a burntofferynge.
                  
                     And Aaron ſhall offer the oxe for his ſynne offrynge and make an attonement for him ād for his houſſe. And he ſhall take the two gootes and preſent them before the Lorde in the dore of the tabernacle of witneſſe. And Aarō caſt lottes ouer the .ij. gootes: one lotte for the Lorde, ād another for a ſcapegoote. And Aaron ſhall bringe the goote apō which the Lordes lotte fell, and offer him for a ſynneofferynge. But the goote on which the lotte fell to ſcape, he ſhall ſett alyue before the Lorde to recō

And the goote ſhall bere apon him all their myſdeades vnto the wilderneſſe, and he ſhall let the goote goo fre in the wilderneſſe.
                  And let Aaron goo in to the tabernacle of wytneſſe and put off the lynē clothes which he put on when he wēt in in to the holy place, ād leaue them there. And let him waſſhe his fleſh with water in the holy place, and put on his owne rayment / and then come out and offer his burntofferynge and the burntofferynge of the people, and make an atonemēt for him ſelfe ād for the people, and the fatt of the ſynofferynge let him burne apon the alter. And let him that caryed forth the ſcapegoote, waſſhe his clothes and bathe hys fleſh in water / and then come in to the hoſte agayne.
                  And the oxe of the ſynofferynge and the goote of the ſynofferynge (whoſe bloude was brought in to make an atonemēt in the holy place) let one carye out without the hoſte and burne with fyre: both their ſkynnes, their fleſh ād their donge. And let him that burneth them, waſſhe his clothes ād bathe his fleſh in water, and thē come in to the hoſte agayne.
                  
                     And it ſhalbe an ordynaunce for euer vnto you. And euē in the tenth daye of the ſeuenth moneth. ye ſhall humble youre ſoules and ſhall doo no worke at all: whether it be one of youre ſelues or a ſtraunger that ſogeorneth amonge you. for that daye ſhall an attonemēt be made for you to clenſe you from all youre ſynnes before the Lorde / and ye ſhalbe cleane. It ſhal be a ſabbath of reſt vnto you / and ye ſhall humble youre ſoules / and it ſhalbe an ordynaunce for euer.
                  And the preaſt that is anoynted and whoſe hande was fylled to myniſtre in his fathers ſteade / ſhall make the attonemēt and ſhall put on the holy lynē veſtimētes / and reconcyle the holy ſanctuary and the tabernacle of witneſſe ād the alter, and ſhall make an attonemēt alſo for the preaſtes and for all the people of the congregacion. And this ſhalbe an euerlaſtynge or dynaunce vnto you to make an atonement for the childern of Iſrael for all their ſynnes once a yere: and it was done euē as the Lorde commaunded Moſes.

                     He that kylleth any man, ſhall dye for it: but he that kylleth a beeſt ſhall paye for it, beeſt for beeſt. Yf a man mayme his neyghboure as he hath done, ſo ſhall it be done to him agayne: broke for broke, eye for eye and toth for toth: euen as he hath maymed a man, ſo ſhall he be maymed agayne. So nowe he that kylleth a beeſt, ſhall paye for it: but he that kylleth a man, ſhall dye for it. Ye ſhall haue one maner of lawe amonge you: euē for the ſtraunger as wel as for one of youre ſelues, for I am the Lorde youre God.

                     ANd the Lorde ſpake vnto Moſes ſaynge: ſpeake vnto the childern of Iſrael and ſaye vnto them: Yf any man will geue a ſynguler vowe vnto the Lorde acordynge to the value of his ſoule / then ſhall the male from .xx. yere vnto .lx. be ſet at fyftie ſycles of ſyluer / after the ſycle of the ſanctuary / and the female at .xxx. ſycles. And from .v. yeres to xx. the male ſhalbe ſet at .xx. ſycles / and the female at .x. ſycles. And from a moneth vnto .v. yere / the male ſhalbe ſet at .v. ſycles of ſyluer / and the female at thre. And the man that is .lx. and aboue / ſhalbe valowed at .xv. ſicles, ād the woman at .x. Yf he be to poore ſo to be ſet, thē let him come before the preaſt: and let the preaſt value him / acordynge as the hande of him that vowed is able to gete.
                  Yf it be of the beeſtes of which men bringe an offeringe vnto the Lorde: all that any man geueth of ſoch vnto the Lorde / ſhalbe holy. He maye not alter it nor chaunge it: a good for a bad or a bad for a goode. Yf he chaunge beeſt for beeſt / then both the ſame beeſt and it alſo where with it was chaunged ſhall be holy. Yf it be any maner of vncleane beeſt of which men maye not offer vnto the Lorde / let him brynge the beeſt before the preaſt and let the preaſt value it. And whether it be good or bad

as the preaſt ſetteth it / ſo ſhall it be. And yf he will bye it agayne / let him geue the fyfte parte moare to that it was ſet at.
                  Yf any man dedicate his houſſe / it ſhalbe holy vnto the Lorde. And the preaſt ſhall ſet it. whether it be good or bad / and as the preaſt hath ſet it / ſo it ſhalbe. Yf he that ſanctifyed it will redeme his houſſe / let him geue the fyfte parte of the money that it was iudged at thereto / and it ſhalbe his.
                  Yf a man halowe a pece of his enhereted londe vnto the Lorde / it ſhalbe ſet acordynge to that it beareth. Yf it bere an homer of barlye / it ſhall be ſet at fyftie ſicles of ſyluer. yf he halowe his felde inmediatly from the trompet yere / it ſhalbe worth acordynge as it is eſtemed. But and if he halowe his felde after the trō
                     petyere / the preaſt ſhall rekē the price with him acordynge to the yeres that remayne vnto the trōpet yere, ād there after it ſhalbe lower ſett.
                  Yf he that ſanctifyed the felde will redeme it agayne / let him put the fyfte parte of the pryce that it was ſet at, there vnto and it ſhalbe his yf he will not it ſhalbe redemed nomoare. But when the felde goeth out in the trompet yere / it ſhalbe holy vnto the Lorde: euen as a thinge dedycated, ād it ſhall be the preaſtes poſſeſſion.
                  Yf a man ſanctifie vnto the Lorde a feldewhich

he hath boughte and is not of his enheritaunce / then the preaſt ſhall reken with him what it is worth vnto the trompet yere / and he ſhall geue the price that it is ſet at the ſame daye, and it ſhalbe holy vnto the Lorde. But in the trompet yere, the felde ſhall returne vnto him of whome he boughte it, whoſe enheritaunce of londe it was.
                  And all ſettinge ſhalbe acordinge to the holy ſycle. One ſycle maketh .xx. Geras.
                  But the firſtborne of the beeſtes that pertayne vnto the Lorde, maye no mā ſanctifie: whether it be oxe or ſhepe, for they are the Lordes allredy. Yf it be an vncleane beeſt, then let him redeme it as it is ſett at, and geue the fifte parte moare thereto. Yf it be not redemed, thē let it be ſolde as it is rated.
                  Notwithſtondinge no dedicated thinge that a man dedicateth vnto the Lorde, of all his goode, whether it be man or beeſt or lande off his enheritaunce, ſhalbe ſolde or redemed: for all dedicate thīges are moſt holy vnto the Lorde. No dedicate thinge therfore that is dedicate of mā, may be redemed, but muſt nedes dye
                  All theſe tithes of the londe, whether it be of the corne of the felde or frute of the trees, ſhal be holy vnto the Lorde. Yf any man will redeme oughte of his tithes, let him adde the fifte

parte moare thereto. And the tithes of oxen and ſhepe and of all that goeth vnder the herdemans kepinge, ſhalbe holye tithes vnto the Lorde. Men ſhal not loke yf it be good or bad nor ſhall chaunge it. Yf any man chaunge it then both it and that it was chaunged with all, ſhalbe holy and maye not be redemed.
                  Theſe are the commaundmentes whiche the Lorde gaue Moſes in charge to geue vnto the childern of Iſrael in mount Sinai.

                  IN the ſeconde ād thirde boke they receaved y• lawe. And in this .iiij. they begynne to worke and to practyſe. Of which practi

                  ynge yeſe many good enſamples of vnbeleffe & what frewill doth / when ſhe taketh in hand to kepe the lawe of her awne power without help of fayth in the promyſes of god: how ſhe leueth her maſters carkeſſes by the way in the wilderneſſe and bringeth them not in to the londe of reſt. Why coude they not entre in? Becauſe of their vnbeleffe Hebre .iij. For had they beleved / ſo had they bene vnder grace / and their old ſynnes had bene forgeuen thē / ād power ſhulde haue bene geuē them to haue fulfilled the lawe thenceforth & they ſhuld haue bene kepte from all temptaciōs that had bene to ſtronge for them. For it is wrytten Iohan. 1. He gaue them power to be the ſonnes of god / thorow belevynge in his name. Nowe to be the ſonne of god is to loue god and his commaundmentes and to walke in his waye after the enſample of his ſonne Chriſt. But theſe people toke vppon them to worke without faith as thou ſeyſie in the xiiij. of this boke / where they wold fight and alſo did / without the worde of promyſſe: euē when they were warned that they ſhuld not. And in y• .xvi. a gayne they woulde pleaſe god

with their holye faithleſſe workes (for where gods worde is not there can be no faith) but y• fyre of god conſumed their holy workes / as it did Nadab and Abihu Leui .x. And frō theſe vnbeleuers turne thyne eyes vnto the phareſyes which before the comynge of Chriſt in his fleſh / had layde the fundacion of frewill after the ſame enſample. Wheron thei bilt holy workes after their awne imaginacion with our faith of the worde / ſo fervently that for the greate zele of them they ſlew the kinge of all holy workes and the lorde of frewill which only thorow his grace maketh the will fre and lowſeth her from bondage of ſynne / and geueth her loue and luſt vnto the lawes of god / and power to fulfyll them. And ſo thorowe their holye workes done by the power of frewill / they excluded them ſelues out of the holy reſt of forgeueneſſe of ſynnes by faith in the blonde of Chriſt.
               And then loke on oure ypocrites which in like maner folowinge the doctryne of Ariſtot le and other hethen paganes / haue agenſte all the ſcripture ſett vpp frewill agayne / vnto whoſe power they aſcribe the kepinge of y• cōmaundmētes of god. For they haue ſet vp wilfull povertye of another maner then any is cōmaunded of god. And the chaſtite of matrimony vtterlye defyed / they haue ſet vp another wilfull chaſtite not required of god / whiche they ſwere / vowe & profeſſe to geue god / 

whether he will geue it them or no / and compell all their diſciples there vnto / ſayenge that it is in the power of euery mans frewill to obſerue it / contrarye to Chriſt and his apoſtle Paule.
               And the obedience of god and man excluded they haue vowed a nother wilfull obedience condemned of all the ſcripture whiche they will yet geue God whether he will or wyll not.
               And what is become of their wilfull pouertye? hath it not robbed the whole worlde & brought all vnder them? 
                     •
                  n there be ether kynge or emperoure or of what ſoeuer degre it be / excepte he will hold of them ād be ſworne vnto them to be their ſervaunte / to go and come at their luſte and to defende their quarels be they falſe or true? Their wilfull pouertye hath all readye eaten vpp the whole worlde & is yet ſtill gredyar then euer it was in ſo moche that ten worldes mo were not ynough to ſatiſfye the hongre thereof.

they curſe him vnto the botom of hell & proclayme him no right kinge & that his lordes ought no longerto obaye him / and interdite his comen people as they were hethē turkes or ſaracenes. And yf any man preache them gods lawe / him they make an heretike and burne him to aſſhes. And in ſteade of gods lawe and mans / they haue ſette vpp one off their awne imaginacion which they obſerue with diſpenſacions.
               And yet in theſe workes they haue ſo greate confidence that they not onlye truſte to be ſaued therby / and to be hyer in heauen then they that be ſaued thorow chriſt: but alſo promeſſero all other forgeueneſſe of their ſynnes thorow the merites of the ſame. Wherin they reſt and teach other to reſt alſo / excludyn get he whole worlde from the reſte of forgeueneſſe of ſynnes thorowe faith in Chriſtes bloude.
               And now ſeynge that faith only letteth a mā in ūto reſt & vnbeleffe excludeth hī / what is the cauſe of this vnbeleffe? verely no ſynne yt the world ſeyth / but a pope holyneſſe & a rightuouſnes of their awne imaginacion as Paule ſayeth Roma .x. They be ignoraūte of y rightuouſnes wherwith god iuſtifieth & haue ſet vp a rightuouſnes of their awne makige thorow which they be diſobediēt vnto y• rightuouſnes of god. And Chriſt rebuketh not the phariſeys for groſſe ſynnes whiche

the worlde ſawe / but for thoſe holyedeades whiche ſo blered the eyes of the worlde that they were takē as goddes: euē for long prayers / for faſtynge / for tythīge ſo diligētly that they lefte not ſo moch as their herbes vnlithed / for their clenneſſe in waſſhynge before meate and for waſhynge of cuppes / diſhes / and all maner veſſels / for buyldinge the prophetes ſepulchres / and for kepinge the holy daye / and for turnynge the he then vnto the fayth / and forgevynge of almes. For vnto ſoch holy deades they aſcribed rightuouſnes and therfore when the rightuouſneſſe of god was preached vnto them they coude not but perſecute it / the devell was ſo ſtronge in thē Which thinge Chriſt well deſcribeth Luce .xi. ſayenge that after the devell is caſt out he cometh agayne and fyndeth his houſe ſwepte and made gaye and then taketh ſeuen we▪ſethen him ſelfe and dwelleth therein / and ſo is the ende of that man worſe then the beginnynge. That is / when they be a litle clenſed from groſſe ſynnes whiche the worlde ſeyth and then made gaye in their awne ſyght with the rightuouſnes of tradicions / then cometh ſeuen / that is to ſaye the hole power of y• devell / for ſeuē with y• hebrues ſignifieth a multitude without uūbre & the extremyte of a thinge & is a ſpeach borowed (I ſuppoſe) out of leuiticus where is ſo oft mencion made of ſenē. Where I wolde ſaye: I will puniſh the

that all the world ſhall take an enſample of the / there the Jewe wold ſaye / I will circumcyſe the or baptiſe the .vii. tymes. And ſo here by ſeuen is ment all the devels of hell & all y• might & power of the devell. For vnto what further blindneſſe coude al the deuels in hell bringe thē / then to make them beleue y• they were iuſtified thorow their awne good workes. For whē they once beleued y• they were purged frō their ſynnes & made rightuouſſe thorowe their awne holye workes / what rowme was there lefte for y• rightuouſnes y• is in chriſtes bloudeſhedinge? And therfore whē they be fallen in to this blindneſſe they cā not but hate & perſecute the light.

                  ¶ The .xxxvi. Chapter.
                  ANd the auncyēt heedes of the childern of Gilead the ſonne of Machir y• ſonne of Manaſſe of the kynred of y• childern of Joſeph / came forth and ſpake before Moſes and the prynces which were aunciēt heedes amōge the childern of Iſrael & ſayed: The Lorde commaunded my lorde to geue y• lande to enherette by lotte to the childern of Iſrael. And then my lord commaunded in y• name of the Lorde to geue the enheritaunce of Zelaphead oure brother vnto his doughters. Now when any of the ſonnes of the trybes of Iſrael take them to wy

And when the fre yere cometh vnto the childern of Iſrael / then ſhall their enheritaunce be put vnto the enheritaunce of the trybe where they are in / and ſo ſhall their enheritaunce betaken awaye from the enheritaunce of the trybe of oure fathers.
                  And Moſes commaunded the childern of Iſrael at the mouth of the Lorde ſayenge: the trybe of y• childern of Joſeph haue ſayed well. This therfore doeth the Lorde commaū

            ¶ The ende of the .iiij. boke of Moſes.
         
         
            
               
               
               
               A PROLOGE IN TO THE fyfte boke of Moſes, called Deuteronomye.
               
               
                  THis is a boke worthye to be rede in daye and nyghte and neuer to be oute of handes. For it is the moſt excellent of all the bokes of Moſes It is eaſye alſo and light and a very pure goſpell that is to wete, a preachinge of fayth and loue: deducinge the loue to God oute of faith, and the loue of a mans neyghboure out of the loue of God. Herin alſo thou mayſt lerne right meditacion or contemplacyon, which is nothing els ſaue the callynge to mynde and a repeatyng in the hert of the gloriouſe ād wonderfull deades of God, and of his terreble handelinge off his enemyes and mercyfull entreating of them that come when he calleth them which thinge this boke doth and almoſt nothinge els.
               In the .iiij. firſt chaptres he reherſeth the benefites of God done vnto thē, to prouoke thē to loue, ād his mightie deades done aboue all naturall power ād beyonde all naturall capacite of faith, that they might beleue God ād truſt in him and in his ſtrength. And thyrdlye he reherſeth the firce plages of God vppon hys enemyes and on them which thorowe impacientie and vnbele
                     ••
                  e fell from him: partelye to

tame and abate the appetites of the fleſhe whiche alwaye fyght agenſt the ſpirite, and partely to bridle the wilde raginge luſtes of thē in whom was no ſpirite: that though they had no power to do good of loue, yet at the leſt waye they ſhulde abſteyne from outwarde euell for feare of wrath and cruell vengeaunce whiche ſhuld fall vppon them and ſhortly finde them oute, yf they caſt vpp goddes nurter and runne at ryotte beyonde his lawes and ordinaunces. Moreouer he chargeth them to put nought to nor take oughte awaye from goddes wordes, but to be diligent onlye to kepe them in remē
                  braunce and in the harte and to teache theire childern, for feare of forgettinge. And to beware ether of makynge imagerye or of bowinge them ſelues vnto images ſayenge: Ye ſar
                     •
                  e no image when God ſpake vnto you, but herde avoyce onlye and that voyce kepe and therunto cleaue, for it is youre liffe and it ſhall ſaue you. And finally yf (as the frayltie of al fleſh is) they ſhall haue fallen from God and he haue brought them in to troble, aduerſyte, ād cō
                  braunce ād all neceſſite: yet yf they repent and turne, he promyſeth them that God ſhall remē
                  bre his mercie ād receave thē to grace agayne
               In the fifte he repeteth the .x. commaūdmē
                  tes and that they myght ſe a cauſe to do them

of loue, he biddeth them remembre that they were bounde in Egipte and how God delyuered them with a mightie hande and a ſtretchedout arme, to ſerue him and to kepe his commaundmentes: as Paule ſayeth that we are bought with Chriſtes bloude ād therfore are his ſervauntes ād not oure awne, ād ought to ſeke his will and honoure onlye ād to loue ād ſerue one another for his ſake.
               In the ſixte he ſetteth out the fountayne off all commaundmentes: that is, that they beleue how that there is but one God that doeth all, and therfore ought onlye to be loued with all the herto, all the ſoule and all the myghte. For loue only is the fulfillinge of the commaundementes, as Paule alſo ſayeth vnto, the Romaynes and Galathians likewiſe. He warneth thē alſo that they forgett not the commaundmentes, but teach thē their childern ād to ſhew the ir childern alſo how God delyuered thē out of the bondage of the Egiptiās to ſerue him and his commaundmētes, that the childern myght ſe a cauſe to worke of loue, likewiſe.
               The ſeuēth is all together of faith: he remoueth all occaſiōs that might withdrawe them from the fayth, and pulleth them alſo from all confidence in them ſelues, and ſturreth thē vp to truſt in god boldlye and onlye.
               
                  Of the eyght chaptre thou ſeyſt how that the cauſe of all temptation is, that a mā might ſo his awne herte. For whē I am brought in to that extremite that I muſt ether ſuffre or forſake god, then I ſhall feale how moch I beleue and truſt in him, and how moch I loue him. In like maner, yf my brother do me euel for my good, then yf I loue him when there is no cauſe in him, I ſe that my loue was of god, ād euē ſo yf I then hate him, I feale and peaceave that my loue was but wordly, And finallye he ſturreth thē to the fayth ād loue of god, ād dryveth them frō all confidence of their awne ſelves.
               In the nynth alſo he moueth thē vnto faith and to put their truſt in god, and draweth thē from confidence of them ſelues by rehearſinge all the wekedneſſe which they had wrought from the firſt daye he knew them vnto that ſame daye. And in the end he repeteth how he coniured god in horeb ād ouer came him with prayer, where thou mayeſt lerne the right maner to praye.
               In the tenth he rekeneth vpp the pith of all lawes and the kepinge of the lawe in the harte: which is to feare god loue him ād ſerue him with all their harte ſoule and mighte ād kepe his commaundmentes of loue. And he ſheweth a reaſon why they, ſhuld that doo: euen

becauſe god is lord of heuen and erth ād hath alſo done all for them of his awne goodneſſe without their deſervinge. And then out of the loue vnto god he bringeth the love vnto a mans neyghboure ſayenge: god is lorde aboue all lordes and loveth all his ſeruauntes indiffe rently, as well the poore and feble and the ſtraunger, as the rich and mightye, ād therfore wil that we loue the poore and the ſtraunger. And he addeth a cauſe, for ye were ſtraungers and god deliuered you and hath brought you vnto a londe where ye be at home. Loue the ſtraunger therfore for his ſake.
               In the .xi. he exhorteth them to loue and feare god, and reherſeth the terrible dedes off god vppon his enemies, and on them that rebelled agenſt him. And he teſtifyeth vnto thē both what will folow yf they loue and feare god, and whate alſo yf they deſpiſe him ād breake his commaundment.
               In the .xij. he cōmaundeth to put out of the waye all that might be an occaſion to hurte the fayth and forbiddeth to do ought after their awne mindes, or to altre the worde of god.
               In the .xiij. he forbiddeth to herken vnto ought ſaue vnto gods worde: no though he which coūſeleth cotrarye ſhuld come with miracles, as Paule doth vnto the Galathians.
               
                  In the. xiiij the beeſtes are forbiddē, partely for the vnclenneſſe of thē, ād partely to cauſe hate betwene the hethē ād thē, that they haue no cōuerſatiō to gether, in that one abhorreth whatt the other eateth. Vnto this .xv. chaptre all pertayne vnto faith and loue cheflye. And in this .xv. he beginneth to entreate moare ſpeciallye of thinges pertayninge vnto the comenwelth ād equite ād exhorteth vnto the loue of a mans neyghboure. And in the .xvi. amonge other he forgetteth not the ſame. And in the xvij. he ent
                     •
                  eateth of right and equite chefly, in ſo moche that when he loketh vnto faithe and vnto the, punyſhment of ydolatres, he yet endeth in a lawe of loue and equite: forbiddinge to comdemne any man vnder leſſe them twoo witneſſes at the leſt and commaundeth to bringe the treſpacers vnto the open gate of the citye where all men goo in and out, that all men might heare the cauſe and ſe that he had but right. But the pope hath founde a better waye, even to appoſſe him with out any accuſare ād that ſecretlye, that no man knowe whether he haue right or no, other hate his articles or anſwere: for feare leſt the people ſhuld ſerch whether it 
                     •••
                  re ſo or no.
               In the. xviij he forbiddeth all falſe and de
                  
                     •
                  eliſh craſtes that hurte true fayth. Moreouer

becauſe the people coude not heare the voyce of the lawe ſpokē to thē in fire, he promiſeth thē another prophete to brīge thē better tydinges which was ſpokē of chriſt oure ſauiour.
               The .xix. ād ſo forth vnto the ende of the xxvij. is almoſt al together of love vnto oure neygboures ād of lawes of equite ād honeſtye with now ād then a reſpecte vnto fayth.
               The .xxviij. is a terreble chaptre ād to be trē
                  bled at: A chriſtē mans harte might wel bleed for ſorow at the readinge of it, for feare of the wrath that is like to come vpō us accordinge vnto all the curſes which thou there readeſt. For acordinge vnto theſe curſes hath god delt with all nacions, after they were fallē in to the abhominacions of blindneſſe.
               The .xxix. is like terreble with a godly leſſō in the ende that we ſhuld leue ſerchīge of goddes ſecrettes ād geue diligēce to walke accordinge to that he hath opened vnto us. For the kepīge of the cōmaūdmētes of god teacheth wiſdome as thou mayeſte ſe in the ſame chapter, where Moſes ſayeth, kepe the cōmaūdmē
                  tes, that ye maye vnderſtod whate ye ought to do. But to ſerch goddes ſecretes blīdeth a mā as it is wel proved by the ſwarmes of oure ſophiſters, whoſe wiſe bokes are now whē we loke ī the ſcripture, foūde but ful of foliſhneſſe.
            
            
               
                  
                  The firſt Chapter of Deuteronomye
                  
                     THeſe be the wordes which Moſes ſpake vnto all Iſrael, on the other ſyde Iordayne in the wilderneſſe and in the feldes by the red ſee, betwene Pharā ād Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Diſahab .xij. dayes iurney from Horeb vnto Cades bernea, by the waye that leadeth vnto mount Seir. And it fortuned the firſt daye of the .xi. moneth in the fortieth yere, that Moſes ſpake vnto the childern of Iſrael acordinge vnto all that the Lorde had geuen him in commaundment vnto them, after that he had ſmote Sihon the kynge of the Amorites which dwelt in Heſbon, and Og kinge of Baſan which dwelt at Aſtaroth in Edrei.
                  On the other ſyde Iordayne in the londe of Moab, Moſes begane to declare this lawe ſaynge: the Lorde oure God ſpake vnto us in Horeb ſayenge: Ye haue dwelt longe ynough in this mount: departe therfore and take youre iurney and goo vnto the hilles of the Amorites and vnto all places nye there vnto: both feldes, hilles and dales: and vnto the ſouth and vnto the ſees ſyde in the londe of Canaan, and vnto libanon: euen vnto the greate ryuer Euphrates.

Beholde, I haue ſet the londe before you: goo in therfore and poſſeſſe the londe which the Lord ſware vnto youre fathers Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, to geue vnto them and their ſeed after them.
                  And I ſayde vnto yov the ſame ſeaſon: I am not able to bere you myſelfe alone. For the Lorde youre God hath multiplyed you: ſo that ye are this daye as the ſtarres of heauen in numbre (the Lorde god of youre fathers make you a thouſande tymes ſo many moo as ye are, and bleſſe you as he hath promyſed you) how (ſayde I) can I myſelfe alone, beare the combraunce, charge and ſtryſte that is amonge you: brynge therfore men of wiſdome and of vnderſtondinge and expert knowne amonge youre trybes, that I maye make them ruelars ouer you.
                  And ye anſwered me and ſayed: that which thou haſt ſpoken is good to be done. And then I toke the heedes of youre trybes, men of wyſdome and that were expert, and made them ruelers ouer you: captaynes ouer thouſandes and ouer hundredes ouer fyftye and ouer ten, and officers amonge youre trybes.
                  And I charged youre Iudges the ſame tymeIudges. ſayenge: heare youre brethern and iudge

righteouſly betwene euery man and his brother and the ſtraunges that is with him. Se that ye knowe no man in Iudgement: but heare the ſmall as well as the greate and be afrayed of no man, for the lawe is Gods. And the cauſe that is to harde for you, brynge vnto me and I will heare it. And I commaunded you the ſame ſeaſon, all the thinges which ye ſhul de doo.
                  And then we departed from Horeb and walked thorow all that greate and terreble wilderneſſe as ye haue ſene alonge by the waye that ledeth vnto the hilles of the Amorites, as the Lorde oure God commaunded us, and came to Cades bernea. And there I ſayed vnto you: Ye are come vnto the hilles of the Amorites, which the Lorde oure God doth geue vnto us. Beholde the Lorde thi God hath ſett the londe before the, goo vpp and conquere it, as the Lorde God of thy fathers ſayeth vnto the: feare not, nether be diſcoraged.
                  And then ye came vnto me euery one and ſayed: Let us ſende men before us, to ſerche us out the londe and to brynge us worde agayne, both what waye we ſhall goo vpp by, and vnto what cities we ſhall come. And the ſayenge pleaſſed me well

and I toke .xij. men of you, of euery trybe one. And they departed and went vp in to the hye contre and came vnto the ryuer Eſcoll, and ſerched it out, and toke of the frute of the londe in their hondes and brought it doune vnto us and brought us worde agayne and ſayde: it is a good lande which the Lorde oure God doeth geue us.
                  Notwithſtondinge ye wolde not conſente to goo vpp, but were diſhobedient vnto the mouth of the Lorde youre God, ād murmured in youre tentes and ſayde: becauſe the Lorde hateth us, therfore he hath brought us out of the londe of Egipte, to delyuer us in to the handes of the Amorites and to deſtroye us. How ſhall we goo vpp? Oure brethern haue diſcoraged oure hartes ſayenge: the people is greater and taller than we, ād the cities are greatte and walked euen vpp to heauen, and moreouer we haue ſene the ſonnes of the Enakimes there.
                  And I ſayed vnto you: dreade not nor be afrayed of thē: The Lorde youre God which goeth before you, he ſhall fyghte for you, acordynge to all that he dyd vnto you in Egipte before youre eies ād in the wilderneſſe: as thou haſt ſene how that the Lorde thy God bare the as a man ſhulde beare his ſonne, thorow

                  And the Lorde herde the voyce of youre wordes and was wroth and ſwore ſayenge, there ſhall not one of theſe men of this frowarde generacion ſe that good londe which I ſware to geue vnto youre fathers, ſaue Caleb the ſonne of Iephune, he ſhall ſe it, and to him I will geue the londe which he hath walked in ād to his childern, becauſe he hath contynually folowed the Lorde. Likewiſe the Lorde was angrye with me for youre ſakes ſayenge: thou alſo ſhalt not go in thiter. But Ioſua the ſōne of Nun which ſtondeth before the, he ſhall go in thither. Bolde him therfore for he ſhall deuyde it vnto Iſrael. Moreouer youre childern which ye ſayed ſhulde be a praye, and youre ſonnes which knowe nether good nor bad this daye, they ſhall goo in thither ād vnto them I will geue it, ād they ſhall enioye it. But as for you, turne backe and take youre iurneye in to the wilderneſſe: euen the waye to the reed ſee.

And whē ye had gyrde on euery man his wepons of warre and were ready to goo vp in to the hilles, the Lorde ſayed vnto me: ſaye vnto thē, ſe that ye go not vp and that ye fighte not, for I am not amōge you leſt ye be plaged before youre enemies. *.

                  And whē we were departed from oure brethern the childern of Eſau which dwelt in Seir by the felde waye from Elath ād Ezion Gaber, we turned ād went the waye to the wilderneſſe of Moab.

For in dede the hande of the Lorde was agēſt thē, to deſtroye them out of the hoſt, till they were conſumed.
                  And as ſoone as all the men of warre were conſumed and deed from amonge the people, then the Lorde ſpake vnto me ſayenge. Thou ſhalt goo thorow Ar the coſte of Moab this daye, and ſhalt come nye vnto the childern of Ammon: ſe that thou vexe them not, nor yet prouoke them. For I will not geue the of the londe of the childern of Ammon to poſſeſſe, becauſe I haue geuen it vnto the childern of loth to poſſeſſe. That alſo was taken for a londe of geauntes and geauntes dwelt therim in olde tyme, and the Ammonites called them Zamzumyms. A people that was great, many and taule, as the Enakyms. But the

Lorde deſtroyed them before the Ammonites, and they caſt them out and they dwelt there ī their ſteade: as he dyd for the childern of Eſau which dwell in Seir: euē as he deſtroyed the horyms before them, ād they caſt them out and dwell in their ſteade vnto this daye. And the Avims which dwelt in Hazarim euē vnto Aza, the Caphthoryms which came out of Caphthor deſtroyed them and dwelt in the ir rowmes.
                  Ryſe vp, take youre yourney and goo ouer the ryuer Arnon. Beholde, I haue geuen in to thy hād Sihō the Amorite kynge of Heſbō, ād his londe. Goo to and conquere and prouoke hīto batayle. This daye I will begynne to ſend the feare and dreade of the vppon all nacions that are vnder al portes of heauen: ſo that whē they heare ſpeake of the, they ſhall tremble and quake for feare of the.
                  Then I ſent meſſengers out of the wilderneſſe of kedemoth vnto Syhon kynge of Heſbon, with wordes of peace ſaynge: Let me goo thorow thy londe. I will goo allweyes alonge by the hye waye and will nether turne vnto the righte hande nor to the left. Sell me meate for money for to eate, and geue me drinke for money for to drynke: I will goo thorowe by fote only (as the childern of Eſau dyd vnto me whiche

dwell in Seir and the Moabites whiche dwell in Ar) vntyll I be come ouer Iordayne, in to the londe which the Lorde oure God geueth vs.
                  But Sihon the kinge of Heſbon wolde not let vs paſſe by him, for the Lord thy God had hardened his ſprite and made his herte tough becauſe he wold delyuer him in to thy hondes as it is come to paſſe this daye.
                  And the Lorde ſayed vnto me: beholde, I haue begonne to ſet Sihon and his londe before the: goo to and conquere, that thou mayſt poſſeſſe his londe. Then both Sihon and all his people came out agenſt vs vnto batayle at Iahab. And the Lorde ſet him before vs, and we ſmote hym and his ſonnes and all hys people.

                  THen we turned and went vpp the waye to Baſan. And Og the kinge of Baſan came out agenſt vs. both he and all his people to batayle at Edrey. And the Lorde ſayed vnto me: feare him not, for I haue delyuered him and all his people ād his lande in to thy hande ād thou ſhalt deale with hī as thou dealeſt with Sihon kynge of the Amorites which dwelt at Heſbon. And ſo the Lorde oure God delyuered in to oure handes, Og alſo the kinge off Baſan and al his folke, And we ſmote him vntyll noughte was left him.
                  And we toke all his cities the ſame ceaſon (for there was not a citie whiche we toke not from them) euen .iij. ſcore cities, all the region of Argob, the kyngdome of Og in Baſan. All theſe cities were made ſtronge with hye walles, gates and barres, beſyde vnwalled townes a greate maynye. And we vtterly deſtroyed them, as we played with Sihon kynge off Heſbon: bringing to nought al the cities with men, wemen and childern.

For only Og kynge of Baſan remayned of the remnaūt of the geauntes: beholde, his yernen bed is yet at Rabath amonge the childern off Ammō .ix. cubettes longe ād, iiij. cubetes brode, of the cubettes of a man.

                  And I commaunded you the ſame tyme (ye Ruben ād Gad) ſayeng: the Lorde your God hath geuen you this londe to enioye it: ſe that ye go harneſſed before youre brethern the childern of Iſrael, all that are mē of warre amonge you. Youre wyues only youre childern ād youre catell (for I wote that ye haue moch catell) ſhall abyde in youre cities which I haue geuen you, vntyll the Lorde haue geuē reſt vnto your brethern as well as vnto you, and vntyll they alſo haue conquered the londe which the Lorde youre God hath geuen them beyonde lordayne: and then returne agayne euery mā vnto his poſſeſſion which I haue geuē you.
                  And I warned Ioſua the ſame tyme ſayeng thyne eyes haue ſene all that the Lorde youre God hath done vnto theſe two kynges, euēſo the Lorde will doo vnto all kyngdomes whither thou goeſt. Feare them not, for the Lorde youre God he it is that fighteth for you.
                  And I beſoughte the Lorde the ſame tyme

ſayenge: O lorde Iehoua, thou haſt begonne to ſhewe thy ſervaunte thy greatneſſe and thy mightie hande for there is no God in heauen nor in erth that can do after thy workes and after thy power: let me goo ouer ād ſe the good londe that is beyonde Iordayne, that goodly hye contre and Libanon. But the Lorde was angrie with me for youre ſakes and wolde not heare me, but ſayed vnto me, be content, and ſpeake henceforth no moare vnto me of this matter, Get the vp in to the toppe of Piſga ād lifte vpp thine eyes weſt, north, ſouth ād eaſte, ād beholde it with thyne eyes for thou ſhalt not goo ouer this Iordayne. Moreouer, charge Ioſua and corage him and bolde him. For he ſhall go ouer before his people, and he ſhall deuyde the londe which thou ſhalt ſe vnto them. And ſo we abode in the valaye beſyde Beth Peor.

And I departed ād came doune frō the hyll and put the tables in the arcke which I had made: ād there they remayned, as the Lorde commaunded me
                  And the childern of Iſrael toke their iurney from Beroth Bē Iakē to Moſera, where Aarō dyed ād where he was buried, ād Eleazer his ſonne became preaſt ī his ſteade. And frō thē

of the Lorde and to ſtonde before the Lorde, ād to miniſtre vnto him and to bleſſe in his name vnto this daye. Wherfore the Leuites haue no parte nor enheritaunce with their brethern. The Lorde he is their enheritaunce, as the Lorde thy God hath promyſed them.

And the Lorde ſayed vnto me: vpp ād goo forth in the iurney before the people and let them goo in ād conquere the lond which I ſware vnto their fathers to geue vnto them.
                  And now Iſrael what is it that the Lord thi God requyreth of the, but to feare the Lord thi God and to walke in all his wayes and to loue him and to ſerue the Lorde thy God with all thyne herte and with all thy ſoule, that thou kepe the commaundmentes of the Lorde ād his ordinaunces which I commaunde the this daye, for thy welth.

                  So that the generacion to come of youre childern that ſhal ryſe vpp after you ād the ſtraunger that ſhall come from a ferre londe, ſaye when they ſe the plages of that londe, and the diſeaſes where with the Lorde hath ſmytten it how all the londe is burnt vpp with bremſtone and ſalt, that it is nether ſowne nor beareth nor any graſſe groweth therein, after the ouertrowenge of Sodome, Gomor, Adama ād Zeboim: which the Lorde ouerthrewe in his wrath and angre.
                  And than all nacions alſo ſaye: wherfore hath the Lorde done of this facion vnto this londe? O how fearſe is this greatt wrath? And men ſhall ſaye: becauſe they lefte the teſtamēt of the Lorde God of their fathers which he made with them, whē he brought them out of the lande of Egipte. And they went ād ſerued ſtraunge goddes and worſhipped them: goddes which they knewe not and which had geuen them nought. And therfore the wrath off the Lorde waxed whote vppon that londe to brynge vppon it all the curſes that are written in this boke. And the Lorde caſt them out of their londe in angre, wrath and greate furyou

ſneſſe, and caſt thē in to a ſtraunge londe, as it is come to paſſe this daye.
                  The ſecrettes perteyne vnto the Lorde oure God and the thinges that are opened perteyne vnto us and oure childern for euer, that we doo all the wordes of this lawe.

And the Lorde thi God will put al theſe curſes vpō thine enemyes and on thē that hate the and perſecute the.
                  But thou ſhalt turne and herken vnto the voyce of the Lorde and doo all his commaundmentes which I commaunde the this daye And the Lorde thi God will make the plenteous in all the workes of thine hande and in the frute of thi bodye, in the frute of thi catell and frute of thi lande and in riches.

                  ANd Moſes went and ſpake theſe wordes vnto all Iſrael and ſayed vnto them I am an hundred ād .xx. yere olde this daye, ād can nomoare goo out and in. Alſo the Lorde hath ſayed vnto me, thou ſhalt not go ouer this Iordayne. The Lord youre God he will go ouer before the ād he will deſtroye theſe nacions before the, ād thou ſhalt cōquere thē. And Ioſua he ſhall goo ouer before the, as the Lorde hath ſayed. And the Lorde ſhall doo vnto them, as he dyd to Sihon ād Og kynges of the Amorites ād vnto their landes which kinges he deſtroyed.
                  And when the Lorde hath delyuered them to the, ſe that ye doo vnto them acordynge vnto all the cōmaundmentes which I haue cōmaunded you. Plucke vpp youre hartes and be ſtronge, dreade not nor be aferde of them: for the Lorde thi God him ſelfe will goo with the, and wil nether let the goo nor forſake the:
                  And Moſes called vnto Ioſua and ſayed vnto him in the ſighte of all Iſrael: Be ſtrō
                     ge and bolde, for thou muſt goo with this people vnto the londe which the Lorde

hath ſworne vnto their fathers to geue them, and thou ſhalt geue it them to enheret. And the Lorde he ſhall goo before the ād he ſhall be with the, and wil not let the goo nor forſake the, feare not therfore nor be diſcomforted.
                  And Moſes wrote this lawe and delyuered it vnto the preaſtes the ſonnes of Leui which bare the arke of the teſtament of the Lorde, and vnto all the elders of Iſrael, and commaunded them ſayenge: At the ende of .vij. yere, in the tyme of the fre yere, in the feſt of the tabernacles, when all Iſrael is come to appere before the Lorde thi God, in the place which he hath choſen: ſe that thou reade this lawe before all Iſrael in their eares Gather the people together: both men, wemen and childern and the ſtraungers that are in thi cities, that they maye heare, lerne and feare the Lorde youre God, and be diligent to kepe all the wordes of this lawe, and that theyr childern which knowe nothinge maye heare and lerne to feare the Lorde youre God, as longe as ye lyue in the londe whother ye goo ouer Iordayne to poſſeſſe it.
                  And the Lorde ſayed vnto Moſes: Beholde thy dayes are come, that thou

muſt dye. Call Ioſua and come and ſtonde in the tabernacle of witneſſe, that I maye geue him a charge. And Moſes and Ioſua went and ſtode in the tabernacle off witneſſe. And the Lorde apeared in the tabernacle: euen in the pyler off the cloude. And the piler of the cloude ſtode ouer the dore of the tabernacle.
                  And the Lorde ſayed vnto Moſes: beholde, thou muſt ſlepe with thi fathers, and this people will goo a whorynge after ſtraunge goddes off the londe whother they goo and will forſake me and breake the appoyntement which I haue made with them. And then my wrath will waxe whote agenſt them, and I will forſake them and will hyde my face from them, and they ſhalbe conſumed. And when moch aduerſyte and tribulacion is come vppon them, then they will ſaye: becauſe oure God is not amonge us, theſe tribulacions are come vppon us. But I wil hyde my face that ſame tyme for all the euels ſake which they ſhall haue wrought, in that they are turned vnto ſtraunge goddes.
                  Now therfore write ye this ſonge, and teach it the childern of Iſrael and put it in their mouthes that this ſonge maye be my witneſſe

vnto the childern of Iſrael. For when I haue brought them in to the londe whiche I ſware vnto their fathers that runneth with mylke ād honye, then they will eate and fyll them ſelues and waxe fatt and turne vnto ſtraunge goddes and ſerue them and rayle on me and breake my teſtament. And then when moch myſchefe and tribulacion is come vppon them, this ſonge ſhall anſwere before them, and be a witneſſe. It ſhall not be forgetten out of the mouthes of their ſeed: for I knowe their imaginacyon whiche they goo aboute euen now before I haue broughte them in to the londe which I ſware. And Moſes wrote this ſonge the ſame ſeaſon, and taught it the childern of Iſrael.
                  And the Lorde gaue Ioſua the ſonne off Nun a charge and ſayed: be bolde and ſtronge for thou ſhalt brynge the childern of Iſrael in to the lond which I ſware vnto them, ād I will be with the.
                  When Moſes had made an ende of wrytynge out the wordes of this lawe in a boke vnto the ende of them he commaunded the Leuites which bare the arcke of the teſtamēt of the Lorde ſayenge: take the boke off thys lawe and put it by the ſyde of the arcke of the teſtament of the Lorde youre God, and let it

be there for a witneſſe vnto the. I For knowe thi ſtuberneſſe and thi ſtiffe necke: beholde, while I am yet a lyue with you this daye, ye haue bene diſhobedient vnto the Lorde: ād how moch moare after my deeth.
                  Gather vnto me al the elders of youre trybes and youre officers, that I maye ſpeake theſe wordes in their eares and call heauē ād erth to recorde agenſt them. For I am ſure that after my deeth, they will vtterly marre them ſelues and turne from the waye which I commaunded you, and tribulacion will come vppon you in the later dayes, when ye haue wrought welkedneſſe in the ſight of the Lorde to prouoke him with the workes of youre handes. And Moſes ſpake in the eares of all the congregacion of Iſrael the wordes of this ſonge, vnto the ende of them.

My doctrine droppe as doeth the rayne, ād my ſpeach flowe as doeth the dewe, as the meſellynge vpō the herbes, ād as the droppes vppō the graſſe.

                  And Moſes went ād ſpake all the wordes of this ſonge in the eares of the people, both he and Ioſua the ſonne of Nun. And when Moſes had ſpoken all theſe wordes vnto the ende to all Iſrael, then he ſayed vnto them. Sett youre hertes vnto all the wordes whiche I teſtifye vnto you this daye: that ye commaunde them vnto youre childern, to obſerue and doo all the wordes off thys lawe. For it is not a vayne worde vnto you: but it is youre lyfe, and thorow thys worde ye ſhall prolonge youre dayes in the lond whother ye goo ouer Iordayne to conquere it.
                  And the Lorde ſpake vnto Moſes the ſelfe ſame daye ſayenge: get the vpp in to this mountayne Abarim vnto mount Nebo, which is in the londe of Moab ouer agenſt Iericho. And beholde the londe of Canaan whiche I geue vnto the childern of Iſrael to poſſeſſe. And dye in the mount whiche thou goeſt vppon, and be gathered vnto thy people: As Aaron thy brother dyed in mounte Hor ād was gathered vnto his people. For ye treſpaſed agenſt me amonge the childern of Iſrael at the waters off ſtriffe, at Cades in the wylderneſſe of Zin: becauſe ye ſanctified me not amonge

the childern of Iſrael. Thou ſhalt ſe the londe before the, but ſhall not goo thither vnto the londe which I geue the childern off Iſrael.

                  THis is the bleſſinge where with Moſes gods man bleſſed the childern of Iſrael before his deeth ſayenge: The Lord came frō Sinai and ſhewed his beames from Seir vnto them, and appered gloriouſly from mount Paran, and he came with thouſandes of ſayntes, and in his right hande a lawe of fyre for them How loued he the people? All his ſayntes are in his honde. They yoyned thē ſelues vnto thy fote and receaued thi wordes. Moſes gaue us a lawe which is the enheritaunce of the cō
                     gregacion of Iacob. And he was in Iſrael kinge when he gathered the heedes of the people and the tribes of Iſrael to gether.
                  Ruben ſhall lyue and ſhall not dye: but his people ſhalbe few in numbre.
                  This is the bleſſynge of Iuda. And he ſayed: heare Lorde the voyce of Iuda and bringe him vnto his people: let his handes fyght for him: but he thou his helpe agenſt his enemies.
                  And vnto Leui he ſayed: thy perfectneſſe

ād thi light be after thy mercyfull mā whō thou tempteſt at Maſa ād with whom thou ſtriuedſt at the waters of ſtrife. He that ſaieth vnto his father ād mother. I ſawe him not, ād vnto his brethern I knewe not, and to his ſonne I wote not: for they haue obſerued thi wordes and kepte thy teſtament. They ſhall teach Iacob thi iudgementes ād Iſrael thi lawes. They ſhall put cens before thi noſe and whole ſacrifices apon thine altare. Bleſſe Lorde their power and accepte the workes of their hondes: ſmyte the backes of them that ryſe agēſt them and of them that hate them: that they ryſe not agayne.
                  Vnto Ben Iamin he ſayed: The Lordes derlynge ſhall dwell in ſaffetye by him and kepe him ſelfe in the hauen by hym contynually, and ſhall dwell betwene his ſhulders.
                  And vnto Ioſeph he ſayed: bleſſed of the Lorde is his londe with the goodly frutes off heauen, with dewe and with ſprynges that lye beneth: and with frutes of the encreaſe of the ſonne and with rype ſrute off the monethes, and with the toppes of mountaynes that were from the begynnynge and with the dayntes of hilles that laſt euer and with goodly frute of the erth and off

the fulneſſe there of. And the good will of him that dwelleth in the buſh ſhall come vppon the heed of Ioſeph and vppon the toppe of the heed of him that was ſeparated fro amonge his brethern his bewtye is as a firſtborne oxe and his hornes as the hornes of an vnycorne. And with them he ſhall puſh the nacions to gether, euen vnto the endes of the worlde. Theſe are the many thouſandes of Ephraim and the thouſandes off Manaſſe.
                  And vnto Zabulon he ſayed: Reioyſe Zabulon in thi goenge out, and thou Iſachar in thi tentes. They ſhall call the people vnto the hill, and there they ſhall offer offerynges of righteouſnes. For they ſhall ſucke of the abundaunce of the ſee and of treaſure hyd in the ſonde.
                  And vnto Gad he ſayed: bleſſed is the rowmmaker Gad. He dwelleth as a lion and caught the arme ād alſo the toppe of the heed He ſawe his begynnynge, that a parte of the teachers were hyd there ād come with the heedes of the people, and executed the righteouſnes of the Lorde and his iudgementes with Iſrael.
                  And vnto Dan he ſayed: Dan is a lions whelpe, he ſhall flowe from Baſan.
                  
                     And vnto Nepthali he ſayed: Nephali he ſhall haue abundance of pleaſure and ſhalbe fylled with the bleſſinge of the Lorde ād ſhall haue his poſſeſſions in the ſouthweſt.
                  And of Aſſer he ſayed: Aſſer ſhalbe bleſſed with childern: he ſhalbe acceptable vnto his brethern and ſhall dyppe his fote in oyle: Yern and braſſe ſhall hange on thi ſhowes and thine age ſhalbe as thi youth.
                  There is none like vnto the God of the off Iſrael: he that ſitteth vppon heauen ſhalbe thine helpe, whoſe glorie is in the cloudes, that is the dwellinge place of God from the begynnynge and from vnder the armes of the worlde: he hath caſt out thine enemies before the and ſayed: deſtroye. And Iſrael ſhall dwell in ſaffetye alone. And the eyes of Iacob ſhall loke appon a londe of corne and wyne, moreouer his heauen ſhall droppe with dewe. Happye art thou Iſrael, who is like vnto the? A people that art ſaued by the Lorde thy ſhilde and helper and ſwerde of thi glorye. And thyne enemyes ſhall hyde them ſelues from the, and thou ſhalt walke vppon their hye hilles.

                  ANd Moſes went frō the feldes of Moab vpp in to mount Nebo which is the

toppe of Piſga, that is ouer agenſt Iericho. And the Lorde ſhewed him all the londe off Gilead euen vnto. Dan, and all nephtali and the londe of Ephraim and Manaſſe, ād all the londe of Iuda: euen vnto the vtmoſt ſee, ād the ſouth and the region of the playne of Iericho the citye of datetrees euen vnto Zoar: And the Lorde ſayed vnto him. This is the lon de which I ſware vnto Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob ſayenge: I will geue it vnto thy ſeed. I haue ſhewed it the before thyne eyes: but thou ſhalt not goo ouer thither.
                  So Moſes the ſeruaunte of the Lorde dyed there in the londe of Moab at the commaundment of the Lorde. And he buryed him in a valey in the londe of Moab beſyde Beeth Peor: but no man wyſt of his ſepulchre vnto this daye. And Moſes was an hundred and .xx. ye re olde when he dyed. ād yet his eyes were not dym nor his chekes abated. And the childern of Iſrael wepte for Moſes in the feldes off Moab .xxx. dayes. And the dayes off wepynge and mornynge for Moſes were ended.
                  And Ioſua the ſonne of Nun was full of the ſpirite of wiſdome: for Moſes had put his hande vppon him. And all the childe

But there aroſe not a prophett ſenſe in Iſrael lyke vnto Moſes, whom the Lorde knewe face to face, in all the miracles and wonders which the Lorde ſent him to doo in the londe of Egipte, vnto Pharao and all his ſeruauntes and vnto all his londe: and in all the myghtye deades and greate tereble thinges which Moſes dyd in the ſight of all Iſrael
