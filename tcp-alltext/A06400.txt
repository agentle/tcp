               MOST Renowned and dread Soueraigne: as heretofore I haue preſumed to shrowd the firſt fruites and degrees of my ſtudies, vnder your Highneſſe Name and protection. So now both humble and entire affection haue moued me to preſent this Treatiſe to your royall View as a Teſtimonie of humble duetie, to expreſſe my poore, yet vnfeigned zeale. For to your Maieſtie the protection of all our doinges doe iuſtly belong: and to your Highneſſe are wee principally bound to doe all Seruice, the which I being willing to performe, and alſo tendring the commoditie and benefite of my natiue Countrey (which GOD willing no occaſion shall cauſe me to omit) I haue published

this Treatiſe and theſe my painefull labours to exonerate my ſelfe of the burthen which euery man is bounde to vndertake for the Common wealth: if my induſtrie could haue produced better effectes it would reioyce to paſſe vnder the protection of ſo excellent & mightie a Prince. But the Arcadians can giue Pales but a fleece of woolle, the Athenians a dish of Oliues to Pallas, and my ſelfe haue nothing but theſe vnpollished lines to preſent to your royall Maieſtie. May it thē pleaſe your Highneſſe, as Minerua harbored an owle vnder her target, Cytherea a deformed Cyclops in her louely boſome, and Apollo the night-rauen vnder his heauenly Lute: to accept in good part the trauailes of your humble ſubiect & vaſſall, which I humbly offer to your Highneſſe, praying dayly that all the blesſinges in heauen may increaſe vpon your Maieſties Perſon and Progenie to your Princelie content and immortall glorie. 
            
               Giuen at London the xx. of Aprill.
                
               Your Maieſties moſt humble and obeiſant ſubiect. Peter Lowe.
               
            
         
         
            
            To the friendly Reader.
            
               IT is commōly ſaid as it is of truth good friend that idlenes is the mother of all vices which doth not onely ingender them but alſo nouriſheth & intertaineth the ſame, for auoyding wherof as alſo hauing promiſed in my Treatiſe of the Spaniſh ſicknes to further thy knowledg with the whole Courſe of Chirurgerie, now doe I publiſh the ſame, not as Plato did his common wealth Cicero his Orator, & ſir Thomas Moore his Eutopia, leauing to the worlde any wiſhed perfectiō not practiſed, but I impart to thee my labors & hidden ſecrets and experiences by me practiſed & daylye put in vre to the great comfort, eaſe and delight of ſuch as had occaſion to vſe my help. For being Chirurgian maior to rhe Spaniſh Regiments two yeares at Paris and ſince that time following the King of Fraunce my Maiſter in the warrs where I had commoditie to practiſe all points, and operations of Chirurgerie, vpon the which occaſion I collected my practiſe with the opinion of both auntient & late writers at vacant howers into a booke which is that I offer to thy view. Seing then I doe not entreat of any vaine fable, but of ſuch earneſt & ſerious matter as toucheth the profit of all men in generall, and the benefit and cōmodity of euery man in particular. I hope the readers hereof will vouchſafe to attribute and graunt ſuch diligence, and willing eare, mynd and attention hereunto as they are accuſtomed to do in thoſe cauſes which they account moſt weightie, graue and neceſſarie and which they are moſt deſirous to know, learne, and vnderſtand. Herein thou maiſt reape the fruits of my trauells and ſtudies, and by the friendly acceptance hereof gaine to thy ſelfe fruition & commodity of my other like labours, like as my Treatiſe of the help of women in the time of their infantmēt, with the curatiō of ſuch diſeaſes as happen cōmonly to maides & maried womē, & the treatiſe which is called the poore mans guide which are works eſteemed by ſuch learned men as haue ſeene them, moſt neceſſary for the cōmon wealth. Some men perhaps more reſpecting their owne priuat gaine then the publique

profit will thinke that I ſhould haue cōcealed thoſe things as did the Egiptians, by writing in letters Hydrographicks. But I rather follow the Grecians who vſed euery yeare to write in the temple of Eſculapius in Epidauro, in the preſence of all the people all the ſicknes, they had cured together with the ſeuerall remedie, for as the Philoſopher ſaith bonū quo communius eo praeſtantius. Alſo being moued by the counſell of Cicero where he ſaith that we ſhould not onely haue regard to our owne particuler, but alſo to the profite and commoditie of our kinſfolkes and frindes, and generally to the common wealth of that Countrey where wee tooke our birthe, the which counſell alſo was obſerued amongſt the old Romaines when their eſtate moſt floriſhtd, for they did accompt him amōgſt the number of the infortunate, that during his life did not manifeſt (in ſome one publique benefit or other) his affectiō & thankfull hart to the place wherin he firſt bread, neuertheles there be ſom enuious and ignorant perſons whom I may iuſtly compare to Antipholus that peareleſſe pick thanke, whoſe filthy hart being inflamd with malice, will find fault with this my labour, to whom I wil anſwere according to the ſaying of Eraſmus Roterodamus, vt ignaui canes omnibus ignotis allatrant ita barbari quicquid non intelligūt carpunt ac dam
                     •
                  āt, only vpō this hope I reſt, that as in good wil & loue I haue done this, ſo the well diſpoſed wil cēſure it in the beſt ſort, and where fault is they will in friendly and charitable maner correct and amend the ſame, the ignorants I would deſire onely to put to their hand and doe better, wiſhing euerie man as much profit and benefit in reading hereof as my willing attempt hath intended them, and ſo I ende bidding the gentle Reader moſt hartelie farwell.

            To the friendlie Reader in praiſe and commendation of the Authour of this Treatiſe M. Peter Lowe Doctour in Chirurgerie, & Chirurgion vnto the French King. William Clowes one of her Maieſties Chirurgions, wiſheth all happineſſe, with much increaſe of knowledge in this moſt excellent and famous Arte of Chirurgerie.
            
               HEere haſt thou friendly Reader truely and faithfully ſet downe vnto thee, a moſt worthy and compendious doctrine, contayning many holeſome and profitable preceptes, for the curing of Tumors, apoſtumes, woundes and vlcers, fractures, diſlocations in generall & particular: with their Indications prognoſtications, ſignes and iudgementes: with diuers operations chirurgicall, for the moſt parte in Dialogue wiſe, very delightſome, plaine and profitable, in which diſcourſe is alſo cited and ſet downe many worthie quotacions, famous authorities, and Authors of renowne, with diuers well experimented remedies, both ſimple and compound, and ſo very briefly concluding with the deuine Preſages of Hipppocrates. All which it hath pleaſed maiſter Peter Low of his owne entire affection and vnfayned zeale which hee beareth to all young ſpringing Plants, called of Paracelſus and other learned writers, the children or ſonnes of Arte: hath here publiſhed in our owne vulgar toungue his moſt fruitfull & neceſſarie Treatiſe of Chirurgerie, not as a ſtranger, but as a deere Friend. In like manner hee hath of late performed one other Treatiſe being extant, and is intituled by him, The cure of the Spaniſh ſickeneſſe. And further I haue thought it good, here to foretell, he is fully determined to publiſh in the Engliſh tongue, other very briefe & pithie workes of Chirurgerie, vnleſſe he be ſtayd by the wronges and iniuries of a rude multitude of ſubtill Sicophants or vngratefull Emulators, men indeede defectiue in their Art and

fouly faultie in their iudgementes, being the onely race and ofpring of Eraſistratus and Theſſalus Tralianus, who haue moſt vnſeemely behaued themſelues behind his backe, chiefely about the anſwering of this preſent booke, before a ſort of them had euer ſeene him, or vnderſtood whereof he intreated, and haue vſed againſt him likewiſe, a nomber of ridiculous, aſpiring and proud pontificall comparriſons, patched together, like the ragges of a beggars cloake: and yet ſome of theſe hideous Monſters in humanitie, are as it were fallen aſleepe, in their owne beaſtly ignorance, making no conſcience in miſpending their talents: neuertheleſſe, they will be marueilous vigilent in carping and reprehending of other mens labours and trauels, which is a point of extreame fooliſhneſſe in them, becauſe it is ſaid, he that hath done leaſt, is worthy of thankes. Notwithſtanding, according to the olde wonted guiſe they haue plounged themſelues againe and againe in the flouds and ſtreames of vnquencheable hatred againſt all men whatſoeuer (Engliſh or ſtraunger) that publiſheth foorth bookes of Phiſicke or Chirurgerie in the Engliſh toungue: neuer conſidering the graue and wiſe ſayinges of Cicero, that a man is not onely borne for himſelfe, but chiefely to profite his natiue Countrey, Parentes and Friendes.It is ſaid, That man may boaſt of his wealth, that hath gotten it well. And many of theſe foreſaide profeſſed enemies are more delighted in bragging & boaſting of their owne cunning and great skill in ſcratching and ſcraping together of abundance of woful-gotten pelfe, then otherwiſe carefull to ſeeke the good of others by publiſhing of ſuch like works of Chirurgerie, as is this preſent Treatiſe, nay, a many of them are ſo euill affected and vncharitably giuen, that they will with all rigour, hard and bitter ſpeeches moſt vniuſtly wounde men behinde their backes, and that after a Paraſiticall manner: ſometimes before perſons of good account in their chambers priuately, & many times alſo at tables openly, with moſt intollerable reproches and odious defamations, and after extolleth them to their faces with a worlde of commendations, they will with the Crocodile ſeeke all aduantages to ſpoyle a man ſecretly

& after waſh his face againe with diſſembling teares moſt trecherouſly. But here to leaue ſuch vaine & variable heads in their indignation
                  •
               , which reward hatred for loue, and contempt for friendly affection: & end with all thankfulneſſe vnto the Authour of this Treatiſe, but moſt ſpecially for publiſhing the ſame in our Engliſh tongue: praying vnto God, who is the giuer of all knowledge and good giftes to increaſe the number of all well minded men, who for the good of poſteritie doe imploy their labours & ſpend their time in the publiſhing of ſuch like bookes of Chirurgerie, which will be no doubt a great benefite vnto the coū
               trey and common wealth.

            His Countrie may reioyce to heare his name,
            that in ſtraunge Lands, ſuch bookes of knowledge ſhowes.
            He ſtudies howe to make good Surgions knowne,

                        COnſidering with my ſelfe, that all men are naturally obliged to ſerue to the common wealth by ſome honeſt profeſſiō, and that no man is able to diſcharge that dutie, and benefit to his natiue countrie, except he learne in his tender age, the ſcience, wherin the ornament therof conſiſteth, after full Deliberation I applyed my ſelfe to the ſtudie of Chirurgerie, which is by the conſent of all learned men, not only a ſcience verie profitable & neceſſarie to all ſorts of people, but alſo moſt auntient and honourable, as manyfeſtly teſtifieth all the antiquitie: in reading whereof we finde the inuention of Chirurgerie aſcribed (for the excellencie thereof) to the Gods themſelues, to witt, to Aeſculape ſonne of Appollo, from the which Podalire and Machaon his ſonnes, learned the ſame and cured ſundrye and diuers, which were deadlye hurt and wounded at the ſiege of Troy, as reporteth Homer the poet.1. & 2. Iliad. Clemens Alexandrinus ſayth that the firſt operator was the Nephew of Noah and after him Apis king of Egipt.Libr. 7. Cornelius Celſus ſayth, that it was found, and exerciſed long before other ſciences. But paſſing with ſilence, Apollo, Aeſculapius, and all that ſort of Gods, as alſo Hippocrates, Galen, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Parmenides, Pimander, Democritus, Chiron, Paeon, and all the auntient Philoſophers, together with Alexander the great, Marcus Antonius

and the reſt of the Emperors, Kings and princes, who profeſſed the ſame, is it not moſt manyfeſt in the old teſtament, that it was inuēted and approued by God himſelfe, for in the XX▪ Chapter of the fourth booke of the Kinges, wee reade, how Eſaie healed by Gods owne commandement Ezechias, by laying a figge on his bi
                           •
                        es, and ſores: as alſo in the 8. and 9. Chapter of Tobias, how the angell cōmaunded him to ſlea a fiſhe, called Caſſidill, & to take the gall thereof to the webbe of the eies. But what, not only was it inuented by the diuine power, but in like maner expreſly cōmaunded in the 8. Chap. of Eccle. & diuers other places, that the profeſſors thereof ſhould be honoured by all men, for God created him to the effect he remaine with thee, to aſſure thee, and thē which are with thee. Now ſeing I haue ſufficiently both by the Scripture and otherwiſe prooued the excellencie of Chirurgerie, it is not needefull to compare the ſame with other artes, and ſciences, for if any art be prayſed, becauſe it was, and is, profeſſed of noble men, ye may clearly perceaue, that the Gods, Emperours, Kinges, and Princes, haue practiſed the ſame. If we conſider the ſentence of the diuine Philoſopher Plato,Plato. that thinges good, are difficile, there is no thing harder, than Chirurgerie, the which will occupie a man all his life time to ſeeke out the nature of things pertaining thereto. If things be prayſed for their ſtrength & force, what thinge is of more ſtrength, than to reſtore a man to his health, which otherwiſe was altogether loſt▪ ſome man may perchaunce obiect to me and alleage, that many profeſſors of Chirurgerie, with their charmes, hearbs full of poyſon & falſe promiſes, deſtroy many people, who would eaſily haue recouered their health, if they had giuen no credit to ſuch diſſemblers. I anſwere, that ſuch deceiuers deſerue and merite to be grieuouſly puniſhed and baniſhed out of all countries, for yee muſt vnderſtand, that ſuch pernitious and ſhameleſſe people are not, nor ſhould not in any wiſe, bee tearmed Chirurgians, but abuſers of

I doubt not, but theſe few words, all men of wiſedome will confeſſe, that theſe charmes, with their Diabolicall hearbs, who trauaile through countries, deceiuing the people▪ are no wiſe to be called Chirurgians, but ſeuerely to be puniſhed, which I ſpeake not of malice, or enuie to any p

The ſeconde is called the ſweete phlegmie, becauſe in ſpitting of it, it ſeemeth ſweete, it prouoketh the bodye to ſleepe. The thirde is called acide or bitter Phlegmie, becauſe in ſpitting, it ſeemeth bitter, it is colde and maketh the bodye hungrye. The fourth is ſalte Phlegmie, it maketh the bodye drye and thirſtie. There are ſome, who make an other kinde, called gipſei, becauſe of the forme and hardneſſe it hath like lyme called gipſei: it is often in the ioyntes and is reckoned vnder the vitrea.

                        In that there is found great controuerſie, for the Aegiptians and Pithagoreans were of the opinion, that there were ſo many ages, as there are ſignes in an hundreth yeeres, thinking a man to liue onely a hundreth yeeres, & euery ſeuenth yeere, we may perceaue ſome notable chaunge, beſides the particular chaunge in euery ſigne, both in temperature of the bodie, and manners of the minde. The moſt part of our late writers are of the opion that the naturall courſe of our life, endureth fine ſpeciall mutations, which they callages, to wit, Infancie adoleſcencie, young age, mans eſtate, and olde age. The infancie is hot and humide, but the humiditie ſurpaſſeth the heate, and laſteth  from the houre of our birth, till thirteene yeeres, and is gouerned by the Moone, as ſayth Ptolomeus. In this time a man is ſubiect to many griefes and diſeaſes, as feuer, the flux,

Wormes in the bellie, the stone, aposthumes, and ſuch like. The adoleſcencie is hot & humide likewiſe, but the heate  beginneth to ſurpaſſe the humiditie, the voice beginneth to growe great in men, and the paps in women, it laſteth vnto 25. yeares, which is the time prefixed for the growing in height in this time they incurre many diſeaſes, and chiefly the Sciatica as ſayth Gordonius,

                            who formeth the manners, & wit. The thirde age is youth▪ which is hot and drie, more hot than drie, and laſteth till 35. yeares, ſubiect to hot feuers, frenzies, and diuers other diſeaſes, and is gouuerned by Venus, which ingendreth greate cupiditie of lust. Mans estate is moſt temperate of all, and  laſteth vntill 50. yeares, and neyther augmenteth, nor diminiſheth, in this time men are ſubiect to hot feuers, flux of blod, plureſie, litargie, frenzie, and ſuch like, and is gouerned by the Sonne,

                            and is full of ſloth, dull, froward, & vneaſie to be gouerned. Laſtly followeth the third part of old age,  which is called Decrepite, vnto the which as ſayth the Prophet Royall, happeneth nothing, but griefe and ſorrow, all the actions, both of bodie, and ſpirit, are weakened, the feeling groweth remiſſe, the memorie decayeth, the Iudgement fayleth, and ſo returneth into infancie, whence proceedeth the Prouerbe, bis pueri ſenes. This old age is ſet downe in the XII. Chapter of Eccleſiaſticus. Some adde the fourth kinde of old age, called ſenium ex morbo. Although that our auntients, haue deſcribed the ages by yeares, yet I am of the

opinion, that the ages ſhould not be deuyded according to the number of yeares, thinking, that thereupon ſhould depēd, youth or old age, but rather after the temperature of the body: for al men, that are cold, and dry, I call them old, ſo there be manye old folke of 40. yeares, and many yong of 60. There is a complexion, that waxeth ſoone old, an other later, thoſe of the ſanguine complexion, are long in growing olde, becauſe they haue much heate & humiditie. The melancholicks waxeth ſoone old, by reaſō they are cold, & dry. As touching the ſex feminine, it becōmeth old ſooner, than the maſculine.

                        It is an affection that reuoketh the naturall heat inwardly, toward the center of the body, but at great leiſure it preſſeth the heart, and drieth vp the bodie, that hardly the ſpirit vitall can gouerne as before, or if any be, it is ſo feeble, that it can not goe with the blood, through the reſt of the body, ſo conſumeth the body, it becommeth atrophie and leane, and cauſeth death. Cicero writeth, ſaying, it were great good among men to liue without eating or drinking,Ad Atticum. but it were a greater good, if men could liue without melancholie, becauſe the meate we eate, doth but corrupt the humors of our bodie, but ſadneſſe and melancholie doth conſume both fleſh & bones, & alſo gnaweth the entrailes, of the which diuers die.

                     The ſecond Chapter, of Phlegmon.
                     
                        PHlegmon is a tumor againſt nature, ingendred of defluxion of bloud in diuers partes of the bodie,Definition. but moſt commonly in the ſoft partes, and is of colour redde, ſore, hard, inflamed,Galen. 14. method. cap. 1. accompanied with feuers and diuers other accidents. Of it there are two ſortes, the true Phlegmon is ingendred of naturall bloud, being in any parte more then is needefull for the vſe thereof, the other commeth of vnnaturall bloud, altered by ſome chaunge, as by mixtion of one or moe of the other humors with it,Differ

to the domination of the humor, it taketh the name, as for example, if the choller domaine amongſt the bloud more then the reſt of the humors, the tumor ſhalbe called phlegmoneriſipelatus, and in like manner in the reſt, as phlegmon edematus or ſchirrus, ſo Galen ſaith, that the humors are ſeldome found alone,Lib. de differentijs morborum. cap. 12. but mixed together. The cauſe is triple, primitiue, antecedent, and coniunct. The primitiues are externall and firſt motiues, as great vſage of meates, which ingender much bloud,Cauſe. alſo all thoſe thinges which may moue the humors and prouoke fluxion, falles, ſtrokes, breaking of the bones, contuſion, heate, exceſſiue labour and ſuch like.

As touching the firſt, which is good diet, as ſaith Galen,
                        Com. 3. epidemiorum. it ſhall be obſerued in ſixe thinges not naturals, which ſhall be colde, contrarie to the humor, which is hotte, ſometime it ſhall be colde and humide, and if it be with feuer the humor, that floweth, ſhall be diuerted by taking away the cauſe, as repletion of the euill humors, by bleeding,Gal. 13. meth. cap. 6. purgations, and alſo by ſtrengthening the parte, if it be debille, alſo by frictions, ventouſeing and binding:

The humor ſhall be euacuated in diuers wayes, according to the degrees of the apoſtumes, as in the beginning, we muſt vſe repercuſſiues, as whites of egges, oxycrate, roſe and plantaine waters, cataplaſmes of bol armenie, terra figillata, barke of pomegranate, henbane, oyle of roſes, vnguent of roſes, album raſis, diacalcitios or populeon. For the augmentation, which is the ſecond degree, we vſe repercuſſiues and reſolutiues, like as mallowes, plantaine, roſes, wormewood, barley flowre, oyle of camomill, oxicrate, pouder of roſes, and mirtle, ſodden wine called ſapa, roſe water, vinegre, ſaffron, of which things, you may make cataplaſmes, liniments, fomentations, as you ſhall finde expedient. In the vigor, we vſe repercuſſiues and reſolutiues in like force, like as mallowes, parietarie, althea roſted vnder the aſhes, oyle of roſes, camomilli with a little beane flowre. In the declination, we vſe only reſolutiues: Auicen counſelleth to ſoften a little, which ſhall be done with fomentations of althea, origan, lyne ſeede, fenigrec, flowers of camomill, roſes, which thinges ſhall all be ſodden in white wine mingled with a little barley meale and hony, vnguent of aragon, martiatum, or agrippa de althea, de melil

For the which we vſe oyle of roſes, waxe and wine ſodden together, as counſelleth Galen. Alſo cataplaſmes of white bread and milke, water, oyle of roſes, violettes, or camomill, or anniſe ſeede, or ſweete almondes, yolkes of egges with a little ſaffron, in like manner the flowers of mallowes, camomill, and mellilot ſodden in wine, putting thereto a little barley flowre and gooſe greaſe, lyne ſeede, alſo vnguentes of roſes, and populeon. If theſe thinges be not ſufficient, we take the leaues of henbane, poppie roſted vnder the aſhes, and tempered with the iuice of ſorrell, and houſleeke, put to it a little hennes greaſe, and ſaffron.Gal. lib. 1. ſimp. cap. 6.

The ſuppuration made we know by the diminution of the accidents, and the tumor which is pointed, alſo with preſſing on it with the two thumbes we find it ſoft, with great innundation.Pau. lib. 6. cap. 34. Then if it open not ſhortly of it ſelfe, it muſt be done by a ruptor or lancet, otherwiſe it waxeth hollow and putrifieth within. In the opening of it, there are three tules to be obſerued as yee haue heard in the generall Chapter.Gal. 13. metho. cap. 5. Here we muſt obſerue, that the inciſion be made in the inferior part,Gal. aphor. 27. lib. 6. Celſus lib. 7. cap. 2. the matter muſt not be euacuated at one tyme; make the inciſion the length, eſchewing nerues, ſinewes, veines and arters, and not by the breadth, as ſayth Auicen. When it is opened, we vſe the yolke of an egge, with a litle Turpintine & oyle of Roſes, for a certain ſpace therafter hony of Roſes or ſirupe of Roſes,Lib. 1. cap. 26: mundificatiue de apio

incureable, and the patient dieth in a colde ſweat. The cure, in ſo much as may be,Celſus lib. 5. conſiſteth onely in amputation of the member,Cure. which ſhall bee done in this manner, for the friendes muſt firſt be aduertiſed of the danger, becauſe often death enſueth, as you haue heard, either for apprehenſion, weakenſſe, or fluxe of bloud. For this cauſe the learned Celſus calleth it a miſerable remedie, yet we vſe it, by reaſon in ſo doing,Celſus lib. 5. cap. de ſphaſelo there is ſome hope, and in not vſing of it, there is none, but ſodaine death, for better it is to looſe one member, then the whole bodie After this, wee muſt apply on the place of amputation, for there is diuerſitie of opinions: Hippocrates and ſome others counſell to cutte in the ioynte,Lib. de hemen. for it is more eaſie to be done, and alſo the marrow is not diſcouered, as in other partes, and the fluxe of bloud is not ſo great. Others thinke it beſt to cut foure inches from the ioynt, either aboue or vnder, according to the putrifaction, which is both more eaſie, and ſure then in the ioynt. For theſe and ſundry other circumſtances, I aduiſe to cut foure inches from the ioynt in all amputacions, ſauing onely if the mortification or riuing of the bone end in the ioynt, thē it may be cut in the ioynt, chiefly in the knees: but whereſoeuer you make your amputacion, remember to cut rather a little of the whole, then to leaue any of the infected, for if any remaine, it infecteth the reſt, and ſo requireth newe amputacion. The place of amputacion noted, we ſituate the ſicke, after a fitte māner, hauing reſpect both to the nature and qualitie of the parte, and to our owne commoditie, then you ſhall haue two men to holde the patient, next, the Chirurgian ſhall commaund the ſicke to bend and put out the member, to the ende the skin, veines & arters may be the more lengthened, that after the amputacion, they be more apparent ſo be knitte or canterized. That being done, the Chirurgian ſhall pull vp the skin & muſcles, as much as he can afterwardes he ſhall take a ſtrong ribband, and bind the member faſt, aboue the place two inches, where the amputacion ſhall be. The vſe of this ribband is diuers, firſt it holdeth the member hard,

that the inſtrumēt may cutte more ſurely, ſecondly, that the feeling of the whole part is ſtupified, & rendred inſenſible, thirdly the fluxe of bloud is ſtayed by it, fourthly it holdeth vp the skin and muſcles, which couer the bone, after it is looſed, and ſo maketh it more eaſie to heale. The bandage thus made, we cut the fleſhe with a raſor or knife, that is ſomewhat crooked like a hooke, the fleſh being cut to the bone, it muſt be ſcraped with the backe of the ſaide knife made purpoſely for that effect, to the ende the perioſt, that couereth the bone, be not painefull in cutting the bone, otherwiſe it teareth with the ſawe, and cauſeth great dolor, and alſo letteth the cutting. This done, ſawe the bone, & being cut, we looſe the ligature, and draw downe the skin to couer the bone in all parts. If there be great putrifactiō, let it bleede a little, for that diſchargeth the part, & ſo is leſſe ſubiect to inflamation, then we put the extremities of the fingers on the orifices of the great veines and arters to ſtay them from bleeding, till we either knit, or canterize them one after another, as ſhall be thought expedient. Where there is putrifaction, we ſtay the fluxe of bloud by canters actuall,

                        & where there is no putrifaction, nor malignitie of humor, we vſe the ligature. The canter or actuall fire, maketh a ſcale, ſtayeth the bleeding, & draweth to it & conſumeth the malignitie, & virulencie of the humor, which is in the part, ſo in that point is better then knitting, by reaſon that in knitting we looſe much bloud, and by drawing the veines, b

This operation is moſt learnedly ſet down by my good friend M. William Clowes one of her Maieſties Chirurgians,Clowes. in his obſeruation with an ſure methode to ſtaye the flux of blood. For a further declaration of the premiſſes, I will recite a hiſtorie, which I did ſee during the ſiege of Paris, where through great hunger, cold, and other miſeries, hapened many grieuous ſickneſſes, as gangrens and mortifications: amongſt the reſt, there was a Spaniſh ſouldior, who had blacknes on the toes of his feete as if they had been burnt, I cut off his toes, & ſcarified the reſt, and vſed ſuch remedies, that he healed. Shortly after there hapened the like in the toes of the other foote, which I would haue cut, and cured as the firſt, but he eſteeming it a deformitie, would not ſuffer mee, ſo that the griefe by delay waxed ſo violent and furious, that by the aduiſe of the beſt Chirurgians in Paris at that time, I was conſtrayned to cut off the whole legge, & ſo helped him. This hiſtorie haue I alledged to ſhewe the daunger of delay, and

that if any ſuch thing happen, wee ſhould not deferre it, but proceede as ye haue heard. Thus we end the tumors, which proceede of the ſanguine humor, and hereafter we will proſecute thoſe which come of choller, beginning firſt with Eriſipelas.

                     WE ſaid, that there were 2, ſorts of hot tumors, to wit, Phlegmon whereof we haue ſpoken, and Eriſipelas,Definition. whereof in this Chapter we will ſpeake. Eriſipelas is a tumor which proceedeth of the humor chollerick,Haly abbas lib 8. Gal. 14. metho. cap. 2. & lib. 2. ad glanc. cap. 1. Lib. & cap. cita to.

It is called in Greeke Eriſipelas, in Latin Iguis ſacer, in our tongue wild fire, it differeth not greatly from Phlegmon as ſayth Galen: ſome eſteeme them to differ, becauſe the one proceedeth of blood, the other of choller, they differ alſo in coulor, the one is red, the other oftentimes pale, the phlegmon entreth deepe in the fleſh and muſcles, and ſo remaineth in the ſkin.

Of it there are two ſortes, like as of phlegmon,Definition. the one is the true naturall Edema,Cal. 2. ad Glanc cap 3. ingendred of the pure phlegmaticke humor, the other is bredde of the phlegme mixed with the other three humors, & taketh diuers names, according to the principall humor as ye haue heard.

In the cure there are two pointes to be obſerued,Cure firſt, to diuert the fluxion by remedies that haue the vertue to cleanſe the pituite humor, as Diaphenicon, Catholicon, Diacartami, agaric & ſuch like, for the adminiſtration of the which, you ſhall vſe the counſell of rhe learned Phyſition, alſo in dyet in the ſixe vnnaturall thinges tending to heate and drought,Gal. lib. de attenuatione victus. cap. 1. eate roſted meates rather then ſodden, but in little quantitie, abſtayne from all thinges that breede phlegme, as fruites, potages, cheeſe, fiſh, hearbes, water, ſadneſſe and much ſleepe, drinke wine with little water, and vſe bread that is well baked, vſe things to corroborate the principall partes.Hipp. 6. epide.

In the cure there is a ſimple intention, to wit, euacuatiō of the matter, which is in the place, and is done either by a launcet, or cauter potentiall, not euacuating all the matter at one time. Here we muſt conſider that thoſe tumors, are ſōetimes inſerted with veines, arters, nerues and tendons, which require great dextetie in the operarion▪ In taking awaye of the bagge, wherein the matter is contayned, to the end yee offende not the former partes: for better it were to leaue the operation by reaſon that oftentimes, there commeth greate flux of blood, as I haue ſeene chieflye on the temples. The tumor being opened, yee ſhall vſe ſuch medicaments, for the cleanſing thereof, as yee haue heard in other tumors. The matter euacuated, wee muſt conſume the whole membrane, wherein it is incloſed, otherwiſe it will returne, we conſume it with pouder of Mercurie, egiptiac or ſuch like, thereafter incarnate and cloſe the wound as in others.

                     The twelfth Chapter, of tumors ingendred of the Melancholick humor called by the Latins atra bilis or nigra cholera and firſt of Schirre.
                     SEing we haue ſuffitiently ſpoken of tumors ingendered of the ſanguine chollerick, and pituitous humor, now it reſteth to ſpeake of thoſe which proceede of melancholy, called tumor Schirrus, by reaſon the Greeke word Schirr ſignifieth hardnes,Definition. Schirre is a tumor hard with litle or no dolor, or feeling, whereof there are two kindes,Gal. 2. ad glanc cap. 5. the one is called the true Schirre exquiſite, the other is falles. The true is as ye haue head,Difference. the falſe is altogether without feeling, yet hardly may it bee perceiued.Gal 2. ad glanc. cap. 9. Gal lib. tumorum cap. 9. & lib. 5. ſimpl. cap 9. There is an other ſort of Schirre ingendred of a phlegmātick, thick & tough matter, and is compoſed of an humor thick and cold. The cauſe is a cold drie humor either of matter melancholick, phlegmatick, or both, for firſt when the blood is made in the liuer, there is ingendred in it a malancholicke humor,Cauſe. 
                        Gal. 14. meth. cap 3. which is like the dreggs of wine, which afterwards is drawen to the milt, for the nouriture thereof, ſpecially by the vſage of ſuch meates, as are apt to make the ſame, and the milt weake to draw the ſame, then it goeth into the veines and is mingled with the blood, which by there vertue expuitrix, expell it by the Hemorrhoides,Gal. 5. ſimpl. ca. 8 lib. de locis aff. cap 3. or varices & ſometime diſperſeth it through the ſkin, and breedeth the Morphew or Leproſie. Sometime it is caſte on the moſt weake partes, and according to the place and qualities of the humor, breedeth eyther Schirre or Cancer.Gal. lib. 3. meth cap. 16. If it bee caſt on any drie part, as ligamentes, tendons, ioyntes, ends of the muſcles, or in the milt, kidneis, lyuer, or matrix, it cauſeth Schir. If it bee caſt on the ſofte partes, as partes glandules, as the pappes, the emunctoires and face, and the priuie partes it maketh cancer. The cauſe alſo maye bee ſadneſſe, ſuppreſſion of the Hemorrhoides and menſtruous purgations,Paul. lib. 4. ca. 32. alſo by too much applying of cold medicines

on tumors, as eriſipelas or phlegmon: for by that meanes, the moſt ſubtill doth reſolue, and the reſt doth become hard.Signes. The ſignes are theſe, the tumor is hard, and groweth ſlowly, of colour liuide when it commeth of melancholie, when of phlegme, it is white, and when of both humors together, it is of a mixed colour, as liuide and white, and inſenſible, becauſe the humor is ſo thicke and drie, which cloſeth the conduites of the nerues, ſo that the animall ſpirite is incloſed in ſuch ſort, that the part hath no feeling. Thoſe which haue no feeling, are altogether incureable, thoſe that haue any feeling,Iudgementes. if they be taken in the beginning, may be helped in ſome ſort, but hardly, thoſe which come to ſuppuration, degendreth eaſily into ſchirre. The Cure conſiſteth in three thinges, firſt in diet, tending to heat and humiditie,Cure. abſtayning from anger, ſadneſſe, feare, and venerian exerciſe: the ſecond point conſiſteth in euacuating the matter antecedent, by purgations & bleeding, by prouocation of the flowers, & hemerhoides: the third point is, to euacuate that which is contayned in the place, which is done by things remollientes and reſoluentes,Gal. 2. ad Glanc like as the greaſe of hennes, cockes, calues or geeſe, alſo gūme armoniac, ſtirax, galbanum, rootes of althea, lillies, camomill, of theſe we make liniments and cataplaſmes, alſo the emplaiſter of Diachilon magnum, et album de vigo with double mercurie.Gal. 2. ad Glanc 
                        Galen commendeth goates dirt to bee an excellent remedie, to diſcuſſe tumors ſchirrous. Sometimes it happeneth in the tendons, and then it is healed by perfumes made thus. Take the ſtone called pyr

If none of theſe ſerue, and it tende to ſuppuration, we muſt not vſe too hotte remedies to ſtirre it, by reaſō it degendreth eaſily into Cancer, for the which haue recourſe to the next Chapter. In ſome partes it may

bee cut, ſo yee cut all, and leaue nothing adherent to the whole partes, nor no roote of it. For the great fluxe of bloud, which happhneth, either knit the veines, or ſtaunch it, with canters actuall, the which is dangerous, when it occupieth the internall partes, for the which Hippocrates forbiddes to ſeeke the exquiſite cure of the occult Cancers.Lib. 6. aphor. cap. 38.

                           ƲE muſt vnderſtand, that Cancer is comprehended vnder the tumor Schirrous, yet there is great difference, for in Cancer there is great dolor, punction and pulſation, which is not in ſchirre, it groweth ſooner,Definition. 
                        Celſus lib. 5. cap. 28. Auicen. tract. 2. cap. 15. Guido. and hath great veines about it. Cancer in Latine is the ſore of a beaſt, Guido ſaith, it is called Cancer, either by reaſon it ſticketh to the parte, like the fiſh Cancer, or becauſe it is round and hath veines about it, like the feete of a Crabbe, and is alſo like vnto it, being liuide of colour as alſo becauſe it gnaweth, eateth, and goeth like this fiſh. It is a tumor inequall, hauing the ſides hard, eminent, turned,Difference. and dolorous. There are two kindes of it, vlcered,Paul Aegin. cap de carſinomate Lib. 4. cap. 26. and not vlcered, the vlcered is immobill, hot by accident, hauing many veines about it, like the feete of Cancer, the not vlcered is called Cancer occult. The cauſe of it is a melancholicke humor, drie, not onely in the part, as ſchirre,Cauſe. but alſo in the veines about it, the which by continuation of time, maketh it more ſharpe and maligne,Gal. 14. meth. whereof commeth Cancer vlcered: alſo euill diet, vſing of thinges that breed thicke corrupted bloud, with other ſuch cauſes,Gal. 2. ad Glanc Paul. lib. 4. cap 26. as ye haue heard in the precedent Chapter: the debilitie of the milte and weakenes of the part. Theſe tumors for the moſt part are ingendred in womens pappes, chiefly in thoſe, who haue great & very fleſhie pappes,Aetius. 4. tract. lib. 4. cap. 43. by reaſon they are glandulous and colde of themſelues: they breede alſo in the

conduites of women, lippes, noſe, eyes, eares, roofe of the mouth, legges, handes, and fundament, by reaſon thoſe partes are weake,Signes. & haue little naturall heate. The ſignes are dolor, tumor, and they ſeeme ſoft, but in touching are hard, the vlcers inequal, ſordides, the ſides ſwelled, horrible to looke on, pale coloured, euill ſauoured, by reaſon of the humor,Iudgementes. which is moſt ſordide and ſtinking. As for the iudgement, thoſe in the ſtomacke, head, ſhoulders, necke and vnder the armes are all incureable, becauſe theſe places can not be cut, for the great fluxe of bloud, which may happen in them.Aetius lib. cita. Hip. lib. 6. aph. 38. Some are little vlcered, ſome much, ſome recent, others inueterate, ſome in one parte, and ſome in another, ſome more maligne then others, and for the moſt part are incureable.

The cauſe is,Cauſe. an hotte humor and biting deſcending from the nerues of the fift coniugation with the dura mater diſperſed in the conduite of the eare: ſometime a vaporous ſpirite & cold thicke humor, which maketh difficultie of hearing, and ſometime deafenes. The Signes are manifeſt.Signes. The iudgementes,Iudgementes. young people are more grieuouſly tormented then olde, and die often, afore it come to ſuppuration, and that within 7. dayes, by reaſon of the great accidents, as feuer, lightneſſe, ſounding. In old folkes it commeth oft to ſuppuration, yet the dolor is verie vehement, by reaſon of the nerue of the fift coniugation, alſo for the membranes and propinquitie of the braines, nature hath giuen it an exquiſite feeling.Gordon. partie. 3. The cure conſiſteth in remedies vniuerſall and particular, vniuerſall, as good dyet, abſtayning from wine and all ſtrong drinke and fumie,Cure bleeding of the veine Cephalicke, and vſing of clyſters, or ſome gentle medicines according to the humor, as ye haue heard in Opthalmi. As for particular remedies, they differ not much from others, except that we vſe no repercuſſiues, abſtayne from all cold remedies, by reaſon of the nerue which is deepe and hollowe. If the dolor bee vehement with heate, vſe oyle of roſes, mirtles and cidoniorum with a little vineger, mixe all together, and drop a little in the eare: cattes water diſtilled is good as ſaith Querſitanus. If it tend to ſuppuration, handle it as other apoſtumes.

It is beſt not to abide the perfect ſuppuration, but ſo ſoone as may be,Dodoneus. to cauſe it open, for by that meanes, the venemous vapor doth diſſippe, the dolor ceaſeth, and nature doth more eaſily diſcharge. It may bee opened by canter, or lancet, but beware of the nerue, veine and arters, for the great accidentes that happen.Lanfranc. 3. tractatu. Bacchanellus de conſenſu medicorum.

Thoſe which are ſuperficiall in the exterior partes, as the head, legges, and armes, may bee knit, and are cureable,Iudgments. thoſe which are profunde and interior, as in the breſt, as of happenth to thoſe, who ſweate exceſſiuely of the Venerian ſicknes, alſo thoſe in the neck, vnder the armes and flanckes, and where there is great dilatation of great arters are not cureable, but death enſueth in few dayes.Paul. lib. 6. If the tumor be opened the patient dieth preſentlye: this happeneth oftentimes by the vnſkilfulnes of the Barbors and Apothecaries, that meddle therewith, & and ruine a number of people through their ignorance, as I haue often ſeene, for ſuch people eſteeme all tumors, that

are ſoft, to be opened, as common Apoſthumes. In Paris 1590. there happened ſuch a diſeaſe to one called Captane Tayle, who was one of the chiefeſt Captaines amongſt the Spaniardes, on the right ſide of his neck for the which I as Chirurgian ordinarie to the regiment, was ſent for, & found that it ſhould not be touched, of which opiniō was alſo my companyon Andrew Scot a man verye expert in his art who was at that time in great practiſe at Paris,
                        Andrew Scot. and now Chirurgiā to the King of Scotland, I ordained remedies to let the encreaſing of it, which receipt of mine being ſent to the Apothecarie, he thought it not meete medicine, for an apoſthume, as he termed it. he ſent for his brother, the glorious Barbor, who ſeing the Captaine, found no difficultie but ſware with great othes, that he had charmes for al ſotes, and the Apothecarie ſware, that hee had ſalues for al ſores, & ſo preſētly opened it with a lancet, ro auoide the matter, as they thought which being the ſpirrit & bold came forth with ſuch violence, that the Captaine died preſētly. I doubt not, but that in theſe countries, there be many ſuch things cōmitted by ſuch ignorāts, & ſo deſtroy many people. I vſe alwayes in ſuch, chiefly in the neck, & vnder the arms, and in the paps, theſe remedies that I preſcribed to the Spaniard, that is, firſt to draw blod in both the arms, next to apply on the ſore cerat Galen or de bolo, or this Ree. pulueris ſuhtiliſſimi, boli armenici, ſanguinis draconis, myrtilorū, lapidis calaminarii in aceto extincti, abſinthei, an. vnc. 1. cum cerato refrigerātis Galeni quantū ſufficit, fiat vnguentū ſiue magdaleon. For the ſame effect I vſe a cake of lead rubbed with quickſiluer, theſe things will hinder the growing for a time, although it be nere the noble parts. If it be in the extremities, as legges or armes, they may liue a long time, by the vſage of the aforeſaid remedies. I knew a womā in Paris who had one very gret in her thigh & liued 10. yeres, if it be litle and ſuperficial, I find no better, thā cataplaſme made of claret wine with the crops & leaues of cypres, which I haue often vſed on the arme, when the arter hath been opened in ſtead of the veine. Otherwiſe I knitt

them after this forme, firſt I inciſe the ſkin long-wiſe, next diſcouer the arter, and being diſcouered, I paſſe a needle with a double thread vnder it, two inches aboue the inciſion or ruption of the arter, and thē knitts it with a double knot, voydes awaye the blood contained, and cureth the wound, according to the eſtate it is in.

I knewe a man, that was cured, by abſtayning from drinke halfe a yeare.

The ſecond intention is, with fomentions and vnguentes reſotiues, as ye haue heard in Edema. The third intention is to corroborate the intemperie of the lyuer as is ample ſet downe by Albucraſis. Some counſell to make inciſiō the which I haue often ſeene,Lib. 3. haly abbas & Guido. but with euill ſucceſſe, & therefore not to bee vſed, as being reiected by Celſus, Paulus, Trallianus▪ Gordonius and others. The manner of inciſion is thus, make the inciſion with a biſtorie by the nauell▪ but 3. fingers vnder it, towards the flanck, ſhuning the Linaea, put a hollow tent in it, and euacuate the humor by little & little. I haue ſet downe an excellēt remedie in the poore mans Guide for the curation of this diſeaſe, if the fault be not in the liuer, whereby I healed many in Paris, during the time of the ſiege. There are many other things, which might be ſpoken of this matter, which I leaue to the mediciners, being more medicinall, than Chirurgicall, but by reaſō that ſometime it falleth vnder the Chirurgians hāds, I thought good thus much to intreate of it.

The cauſe is great aboundance of melancholicke,Cauſe. pituitous or bilious bloud, alſo great vſage of mordicant medicines, as ſaith Gordonius. The Signes are theſe, if the humor be colde, the ſicke feeleth great heauineſſe,Signes. and dolor, and trembling of the bellie, if the humor be hotte, there ſhall be great pulſation, euill coullor of the face, heauineſſe of the eyes. The Iudgementes, this diſeaſe is dangerous and difficill, for ſometime the great euacuation cauſeth the hydropſie,Iudgementes. euil colour, and weakeneſſe of the bodie, which often endeth in fiſtule. If they be ſodainely ſtayed, they ingender dangerous maladies, and often death, the humor taking the courſe to ſome other part, as the liuer or the lightes, as ſaith Bartapallia: if they voyde moderatly, it is good, and preſerueth the ſicke from melancholie, leproſie, ſtrangurie, griefe in the ſides, and inflamation on the lightes. The naturall courſe of them is to voyde euery moneth once,Hip. 6. epid. or at leaſt foure or fiue times in the yeere. The Cure is ſomewhat difficill, the part being ſenſible and colde,Cure hauing no force of it ſelfe, alſo being in a lowe place, eaſie to receiue fluxion, and being in a priuie place, hard to come to at all times: yet in ſo farre as may be, it conſiſteth in good dyet, abſtayning from all thinges of euill digeſtion, and which breede melancholie, nexte, the bodie ſhall bee gently purged, then bleede,Finchius lib. 3 de medendis morbis.

We knowe the Lights to be hurt, when the ſicke doth breath with difficultie, voyding a ſpumous blood at the mouth and wound, & lying on the wounded ſide, ſpeaketh, and not on the other ſide: ſome raue, the red colour and heate goeth to the viſage, in the end iſſueth quantitie of matter at the wound.Diaphragm. The Diaphragme being hurt, the flancks retire & cloſe, there is great weight on the part, dolor in the rig back, cough, difficultie of breath, with iſſue of a ſpumous blood at the wound, as in the Lightes. If the Liuer be hurt,Lyuer. there cometh out great abundance of blood the flanckes retire towards the back, the colour like death, the eyes ſinke in the head, want of reſt, the vrine is bloody, the excrements purulent, the ſick cometh to lie on the belly, the dolor is pricking, extending to the breaſt bone and ribbes, in reſpiring he draweth in his ſhoulders and vomiteth choller.Lib. 6. cap. 88.

                     THe contuſed wound, to the which chaunceth great accidence,Definition. according to the inſtrument it is done with, is a kinde of ſolution of continuitie, made with a bruiſe,4. theurapeuticorum. and is called by Galen and ſome late wtiters echymoſis, in the which there is ſeparation and dilaceration of the fleſh & muſcles thereof with great quantitie of bloud and differeth ſomewhat from attrition as ſaith Auicen, for contuſion happeneth in the fleſhie partes,Gal. li. 4 meth. cap vlt. and attrition is done in the head and ende of the muſcles. The ſignes are like vnto other woundes with inequalitie and roughnes in the fleſh and skinne, diuerſitie of figure,Signes. according to the diuerſitie of the cauſe, the part and partes about are blacke and liuide, by reaſon of the bloud, which is out of his place and remaineth in theſe partes, and cannot be euacuated by ſenſible or inſenſible tranſpiration, but by ſuppuration. The Iudgementes ſhall bee according to the greatneſſe of the hurt, for great contuſions are dangerous,Iudgementes. for the corruption of the member, and conſequently the bodie alſo. As for the Cure, there are foure intentions, firſt, to ſtay the fluxe, if the contuſion be with wound, as oft happeneth,Cure. next to ſtay the fluxion of humors on the part by euacuation, as purgations, bleeding, ventouſing▪ ligators, frictions, good regiment in vnnaturall thinges: thirdly in vſing particular

The wound ſuppured, and the accidentes corriged, it muſt be cleanſed with honney of roſes and turpentine, mundificatiue de appio,Gal. de comp. medicament. & Aetius lib. 5. apoſtolorum and ſuch like, as yee ſhall heare in the introductiō to & Chirurgerie in the pooremās guide.

                     The fifth Chapter, of woundes done by gunſhot.
                     I Haue ſpoken of ſimple, compound and contuſed woundes, nowe will I intreat of woundes with dilaceration and loſſe of ſoft and hard partes, and is made by diuers ſortes of inſtrumentes, as bulle

I will ſhewe my opinion touching the ſame, not making any mention of others, who haue written of the ſame. This kinde of woundes is accompanied with tumor, dilaceration of fleſh, veines, arters, nerues, tendous, ligamentes and boanes, ſuperficiall▪ profound, otherwhiles through the bodie, and according to the difference, the Chirurgian muſt take his indication to diuerſifie the remedie, in like manner, apoſtume, dolor, corruption of the partes gangrened and mortified through the great aboundance of bloud, diſperſed betwixte the muſcles, alſo for the diſſipation of the naturall heate, ſometime one onely accident, otherwhiles diuers together, for the which we vſe two curatiue intentions, to wit, reſtitution of ſuch things as are loſt, and to conioyne the partes deuided. Theſe woūds come indifferently to all parts of our bodie whereof there are diuers opinions, ſome thinke, that there is venenoſitie in the pouder, and burning in the bullette, which is falſe, for the thinges whereof the pouder is ordinarily made, as brimſtone, ſaltpeter, coales of diuers ſortes of trees, water, wine and aquauitae, haue no venenoſitie in them, likewiſe there is no burning in the bullet, for if the bullette of lead beeing ſhotte a great way, ſhould burne, through heat would be melted it ſelfe. I haue cured diuers within theſe tenne yeeres of diuers nations, which haue followed the warres in Fraunce, in the which I haue found no more difficultie then in other contuſed woundes: ſo I thinke theſe accidentes come onely by contuſion and dilaceration of the fleſh, and not by any venenoſitie, nor vſtion: yet there may be ſome extraordinarie mixtion in the pouder, which cauſeth venome, for the which we take ſome other indication, acccording to the thing. The Cauſes, Signes, differences and Iudgements are not much different from thoſe of other woundes ſet downe, and ſufficiently diſcourſed in the generall Chapter,Cure. as for the Cure there are fiue

intentions, firſt, to draw the ball, ſecondly, to appeaſe the dolor, thirdly, to cauſe ſuppuration, fourthly, in mundifiyng generation of fleſh and conſolidation, fiftly, in correction of the accidents. As touching the firſt and ſecond, to draw out the bullet and appeaſe the dolor, I haue diſcourſed at length in the generall Chapter, neuertheleſſe, becauſe in theſe woundes there is vehement dolor,Gal. therapen. which weakeneth the ſicke, hindereth nature, cauſeth fluxion, letteth ſuppuration, and conſumeth the fleſh which is contuſed, I will ſet downe things more particularly for the appeaſing thereof, in chaunging the temperature of the whole bodie, in due vſage of the ſixe vnnaturall thinges, by purgations & bleeding, and abſtayning from thinges which cauſe dolor, as great tentes, ſections, ſtraight bandages, wrong ſituation of the part, inciſion, vnleſſe there be great neede.

Paulus Aegineta reporteth that mans biting when hee is faſting in the morning,Lib. 5. cap. 26. is very venemous. Gordonius ſaith, that the biting of a madde dogge is moſt dangerous, for albeit the ſicke feele not much in the beginning▪ yet after a moneth or a yeere it doth appeare, for in that time it ſeeketh the hearte, beeing of nature and qualitie to ſeeke the deſtruction thereof.

If the wound be little, we waſh it with oxycrate warme, after the ventouſes are taken away, it ſhall be good to open little dogges, cattes, or foules and lay on it, ſometime to apply canters actuals, to conſume all that which is affected.

If the venim bee diſperſed through the bodie, vſe purging, vomiting and bleeding, alſo prouocation of ſweate and vrine. The venim by theſe meanes beeing taken away, proceede in the cure, as is ſaid in other woundes.

                     HEere it ſhall be neceſſary to vnderſtand, that in our bodies there are three noble partes, whereby wee are gouerned, and without them can doe nothing, as the braines, the heart and the lyuer, for the which three partes nature hath ordained for euery one a ſeuerall domicill, as the head for the braines, the thorax or breaſt for the heart, and the inferior venter for the lyuer, the which three domicilles being wounded, there muſt ſome other particularities bee obſerued for curation thereof, then ye haue heard. Therefore we wil diſcourſe of them ſeuerally, & firſt of the head. The head,Definition. wherein are contained the braines, is ſubiect to ſolution of continuitie, which ſometime is ſimple, otherwhiles compoſed with fracture of the crane, ſome penetrateth the membranes, other the proper ſubſtance of the braines,Cauſe.

Thoſe which penetrate at the backe are more dangerous,Cauſe. then at the interior part, becauſe of the veines, arters,Signes. nerues and ſuch like. The Cure conſiſteth in good dyet in the ſixe vnnaturall thinges, purgation,Cure. letting of bloud according to the temperature of the body, time and Region. Thoſe which doe not penetrate, differ nothing from the generall of other ſimple woundes, ſauing onely in binding, which muſt be incarnatiue, ſometime narrowe, otherwhiles broad according to the difference and ſcituation of the wounde. Touching thoſe which penetrate, there is great diuerſitie of opinion in the cure, ſome are of the opinion to conſolide the wound as ſoone as may bee, to hinder the externe ayre to hurt the partes vitall, others giue counſell to holde them open, and in caſe the iſſue be not large enough, to dilate it, and make it larger▪ that if there bee any bloud or other thing in the capacitie, it may auoyde, but which of theſe wayes ought to bee followed, the iudgement of the expert Chirurgian is to bee required: knowing firſt, if it doth

penetrate, which ſhall bee done in cloſing his mouth and noſe, and then holding a candle to the wound, if the ayre cōmeth forth, it is ſure, that it penetrates, if there be bloud in the capacitie, you ſhall know by the ponderoſitie of the diaphragma, accompanied with dolor, feuer and vomiting, if any chiefe part be offended, ye ſhall know by the ſignes ſet downe in the Chapter Generall. If neither bloud bee ſhedde, nor any parte offended, yee ſhall conglutinate the wound, putting no tent therein, vſing onely a little of my balme ſet downe in the Chapter of Gunſhot, in the meane time vſe one potion vulnerar, which doth penetrate. If there be any little thing left in the wound, nature will eaſily diſcharge it, for as ſaith Galen, it doth expell not onely that which offendeth,Com. 7. apho. through the pannicles, but alſo through the middeſt of the bones. Thoſe which penetrate with effuſion of bloud on the diaphragma & are not mortall, muſt be tented, with a threed at the tent, to the ende that if it goe in, it may bee drawne out agayne, cauſe the ſicke lie on the ſore ſide, chiefly when you dreſ

of the ſides, corruption of the boane, varices, hemoragie of bloud: alſo roundneſſe in figure, for the which Hippocrates counſelleth if the vlcer bee round, to put on it an other forme. Imbecillitie of the part vlcered, indiſpoſition of the lyuer or milte, retention of the monethly courſe in women, and of the hemerroihdes, and alſo the applying of medicines vnmeete for ſuch vlcers. Many ignorant barbors faile herein, thinking one kinde of emplaiſter to bee good for all ſores, in the which they are deceiued: for hee that would cure vlcers, muſt firſt take away the cauſe, as alſo the impedimentes and accidentes, otherwiſe he trauaileth in vaine, as ſaith Paulus, for the perfourmance whereof, we muſt ordayne firſt good dyet, ſecondly take away the cauſe antecedent, to witte, the humor which falleth,Lib. 6. cap. 82.

                     The ſecond Chapter, of Vlcers ſanions and the Curation thereof.
                     AS in the former Chapter I haue ſpoken of Vlcers in generall, of their difference, cauſe, ſignes and iudgements & cure, ſo now I will particularly intreat of them. All Vlcers are either ſimple or compoſed,Gal. 4. meth. cap. 1. with ſome other maladie, the ſimple Vlcer requireth onely deſiccation, thoſe which are compoſed, and ioyned with ſome other accident, except thoſe accidentes be taken away, cannot heale, for the cure of the which, there are foure Intentions, firſt in the way of life, which ſhall bee according to the ſtrength of the ſicke, nature of the maladie, & aboundance of the

humors in the bodie, as if the humors be hotte and ſharpe, we ordaine colde thinges, The ſecond Intention is, in diuerting and intercepting the matter antecedent, which is done by purgations and bleeding if the ſtrength permit, alſo by frictions, ligators, application of emplaiſters, that haue the force to repell the matter. The third Intention is, in correcting the accidents ioyned with the vlcer, as dolor, tumor, contuſion, excreſcence of the fleſh, calloſitie of the lippes, rottenneſſe of the boane, varice and wormes. Firſt then, wee muſt labor to take away the intemperie, which ſhall be knowne by the colour of the member, by the touching and feeling of the patient, which ſometime is hotte, ſometime colde, which if it be drie, wee remedie it by purgation and bleeding, alſo if neede be, foment the place with hotte water, till it growe redde, as counſelleth Galen: thereafter vſe this vnguent made of mallowes, ſodden in water with a little hogges greaſe and honney mixed with nutritum,4. meth. ceratum galeni roſatum, populeon, incorporate with plantaine water, morrell and houſleeke. If the Intemperie be humide, vſe vnguents that drie, as pompholigos, de plumbo, ceruſa, allom water, vnguent baſilicon, citrinum, fuſcum de althea: or this fomentation of claret wine in the which hath beene ſodden roſes, betonie, wormewood, roch allom. If the Intemperie bee cold, we foment the part onely with wine, wherein wormewood hath beene ſodden, hyſſope, calamint, roſemary, vnguent baſilicon & de althea. If the Intemperie be hotte, we remedie it by water of plantaine, ſolanum, houſleeke, or vnguentum rubrificum cum camphora, or cerat galen: if there be dolor with vlcer, which commeth of intemperie, eroſion, of a ſubtill humor or ſolution of continuitie, or plenitude of groſſe humors, or a flatuous ſpirite, for the which take vnguent populeon, oyle of yolkes of egges, vnguentum album camphoratum, with other ſuch as are in tumors, if the dolor be vehement, we make a cataplaſme narcotick of barly flowre, oyle of roſes, henbane, mandrager, poppie,

If theſe thinges be not ſufficient, and the alteration be greater, we vſe canters potentiall, as oyle of vitriol, oyle of cloues, mercurie, camphire, ſulphure, ſalis, antimonij, incenſe and ſuch like. But if the rottenneſſe be great, fat and vnctious, wee apply canters actualls once or twiſe, to ſeparate the whole from that which is rotten, perfunding till the outmoſt of the altered thing, which ye ſhall know, when there commeth no more humiditie: if you continue them longer, you conſume the humiditie naturall, which ſhoulde ingender fleſhe betwixt the rotten and the whole, for the which haue good Iudgement. This remedie hath vertue to corroborate and comfort the parte, and drieth and conſumeth the euill humors, and helpeth the ſeparation, the which beeing perceiued, ſhake it by little and little, and draw it not by force: if it be drawne, before the fleſh be growne on the whole, the ayre will alter the other alſo. Of this remedie commeth no dolor, if yee touch nothing but the boane, after the canters are applyed, we vſe oyle of roſes with whites of egges for the firſt two dayes, then mixed with whites of egges and freſh butter with honney, thereafter ſome mundificatiue till the boane bee exfoliated, and then vſe the powder aboue written mixed with honney, to incarnate & cicatrize,

thereafter conſolide the vlcer. If the rottennes come to the marow and the bone be all corrupted there is no remedy, but amputation, except in the head, haunch, and rigge backe, in the which we vſe remidies palliatiues as ye haue heard.

                        Definition.BEcauſe of Burning and violent heate come vlcers dolorous and euill to heale, therefore I will ſet downe the way to cure ſuch vlcers. Burning is a violence done by the ardor of the fire, hotte water, or ſome other hotte licour, in diuers partes of our bodie, and make many accidents. The ſuperficiall are ſubiect to inflamation, the great ones to excoriation and exulceration, thoſe which are meane, haue little bliſters on the skinne, in all which is dolor, redneſſe, ardor & ſuch like with euident ſignes apparent to the ſight. The Cure is, if the combuſtion be great, firſt in the way of life,

                           ure. tending to tenuitie, next in vniuerſall remedies according to the humors which raigne. The topicall remedies are diuerſified according to the diuerſitie of the accidentes: Ariſt. in his firſt probleme counſelleth to holde the place burnt to the fire, and ſo one heate draweth forth another. Alſo whites of egges with roſe water ſtay the puſtuls, thoſe which are ſuperficiall, accompanied with inflamation and dolor, muſt be cured with thinges that refreſh, as whites of egges, water, vineger, houſleeke, lettuce, morrell, plantaine, henbane, ſolanum, roſes or the waters hereof diſtilled and layd on the place with a cloth wette therein. Allom and Ceruſe diſſolued in Camphire water, is good: theſe thinges appeaſe the dolor and inflamation, and heale the Burne, alſo the blades of leekes or onions peeled, with ſalt, and put on, healeth it maruailouſly, or lettuce with ſalt. The rootes of lillies fryed in oyle of roſes, or the leaues ſodden, will heale it alſo: if there be bliſters, pearce them, if there

be vlceration, vſe remedies lenitiues & deficcatiues, as this, oyle of nuttes onc. 3. waxe onc. di. mixe them together and waſhe them in plantaine water and lay on it. Alſo leeke leaues ſodden in wine, or the iuyce of them with vnguent roſat▪ is good, if the ſore neede mundifiyng, take turpentine waſhed in the decoction of barley, a little ſyrrupe of drie roſes, with aloes and barley meale. The ſore beeing mundified, cicatrice it with vnguent populeon, diapompholigos, album raſis, emplaſtium de minio, or diacalciteos diſſolued in redde wine, wette a cloth therein and lay on it. The foreſaid remedies muſt be ſoftly applyed, not touching it with the hand, the oft touching doth iritate and cauſe fluxion, therefore I haue ſet downe a ſecrete in the poore mans guide, to heale all kindes of burning in a ſhott time, with one emplaiſter onely, wherewith I haue had good effect, at diuers times. This remedie is very good, eaſie to be had, and healeth without skarre. Take the barke of an Elme tree, ſteepe it a night in water, take it out in the morning, ye ſhall perceiue a ielly on the inner ſide of it, wipe off that ielly with a feather, or thy finger, anoint the ſore therewith, and it healeth, as is aforeſaid. And thus we ende the Treatiſe of Vlcers.

The Aſtrologians are of the opinion, that the ſtarrs, planets and  ſignes haue power in mans body and that euery humor of the body is gouerned by certaine ſignes,Signes. as the ſanguine by Taurus virgo and Capricornus, the phlegmatick humor by Aries & Sagittarius, the chollerick by Cancer & Piſces, the melancholick by Libra and Aquarius. According to their opinion and ſometime Phiſitians alſo, alſo Conſtantinus Aefricanus, wee muſt not let blood that part where the ſigne is, which things are not obſerued of the moſt learned Phiſitians and Chirurgians, as Hipp. Gaelen, Oribaſius, Sardinius, Aetius, Paulus, Raſis, Auicen, Haly abbas, and diuers others Latins Greekes and Arabes. For when the body is greuouſly oppreſſed with maladie, wee muſt not ſtay for the courſe of the celeſtiall ſignes. There are ſome, who obſerue the courſe of the Moone, except in greate neceſſitie, and the new Moone is better, than the old, yet it muſt bee conſidered, by reaſon of ſome other

euacuation, for the which olde women muſt bee bledde in the olde of the Moone, and young women in the newe: as noteth Gordonius in theſe wordes.

The ſicke muſt haue his minde free from paſſions, chiefely feare, which retireth the bloud to the center of the bodie: if he feare fainting, hee muſt eate an egge before, or a toſte in wine and lie in his bedde.

                     VEntouſing which the Latines call 
                           Ʋentoſatio, is no other thing but application of an inſtrument, either for the euacuation of ſome humor vnder the skinne, or to diuerte the courſe of an humor to ſome other parte, and to draw away ſuch thinges, as is hurtfull, that nature cannot chace forth, and alſo to drawe out winde in ſome parte of the bodie. It is called cucurbitula, or pixis, made of braſſe,Albucraſis. horne, glaſſe, wood or earth in diuers formes ſome ſhorte, ſome long necked, for the moſt part wide bellied, and are called ventoſes a ventre, as ſaith Auicen: ſome are bigge, ſome leſſe, according to the proportion of the member, the mouth is reaſonable wide, the lippes round and thicke, and are applied moſt commonly in diuers partes of our bodie. They are ſometime applyed with ſcarrification & extraction of bloud, otherwhiles without ſcarrification, as alſo on diuers parts of our bodie, according to the cauſe, as to draw out ſome hurtfull humor of the bodie, with ſcarrification and extraction of bloud. Firſt we apply them in the necke to euacuate the humor from the head, for heauineſſe of the head, fluxions on the eyes, affections of the face, and ſtincke in the mouth: ſecondly wee apply them on the middeſt of the necke behinde, for difficultie of breath and cough: thirdly vnder the chinne and ſides of the necke for dolors and vlcers of the mouth, corruption of the gummes & Migrim, Opthalmie, ſore teeth. Fourthly on the ſhoulders for diſeaſes in the Thorax, pleureſie, ſpitting of bloud, affections on the ſhoulders, of repletion, for many affections of the head and throat. Fiftly on the region of the reines, good for apoſtumes and dolors of the reines & lyuer. Sixtly on the middeſt of the armes, for dolor in thoſe partes, and in ſtead of bloudding, and is vſed both in olde and young. Seuenthly on the os ſacrum and thereabouts, & is good for the hemerroides, and fiſtules in the fundament. Eightly on

the middeſt and rootes of the thighes, and is good to prouoke the monethly courſe, for Strangurie, dolors of the matrix, bladder and kidneis. The ventouſes without ſcarrification, which we call drie ventouſing, are applyed for the moſt part in a xi. places. Firſt on the open of the head, for  relaxation of Vuula,15. therapeutic. and to ſtay the rheume, as ſaith Galen. 
                         Secondly, vpon the hypocondres, to diuerte the bleeding at the noſe, as ſaith Galen, when the right noſethrill bleedeth, put the ventouſes on the region of the lyuer, if the left ſide, on the milt, ſo in like manner on all partes that bleede, wee put the ventouſes on the parte oppoſite for the communication that the veſſelles haue one with an other. Thirdly  on the pappes, to diuerte the purgations that runne much, and for the ventoſitie about the lyuer.Bartapallia. Fourthly in the beginning  of the nerues for Palſie. Fiftly on the nauell for the windie collicke.Cuido. Sixtly on the flancke for ventoſitie of the 
                         milte. Seuenthly, on the nauell or wombe, to reduce the inteſtine, or matrix fallen, and ventoſities in the bellie, and  dolors which happen in time of purgations.Auicen 3. canod Eightly wee  apply them on vritors, to drawe downe the ſtones and grauell  to the bladder. Ninthly on the eares and mouth of  vlcers to drawe out any thing contayned therein, alſo for drawing out of poyſon.Haly Abbas. lib. 9. Tenthly, if any where there is mattir deepe, to drawe it out to the ſuperfice, as in bubons venerians, alſo in parotides maligne, or in any other parte where neede is to drawe any thing to the ſuperfice. Eleuenthly,  on the necke for Squinancie.

                        FIrſt, if the body be plethoricke, it muſt be taken away by bleeding, otherwiſe the ventouſing is noyſome, next, if the bloud or humors be thicke, we vſe to foment the

place with hotte water, & rubbe it long with a hotte cloth, that ye neuer ſcarrifie, except the application of the drie ventouſes haue preceded,Gal.

That beeing done, it ſhall be very neceſſary and expedient to drie the place with a ſofte cloth, annoynt it with oyle of roſes, butter, cerat Galen, or roſat Meſnes,

                     THeſe little beaſtes, which the Latines call Sanguiſuga or Hirudines, in our toungue Horſleaches, are little wormes, the length of two inches or three, great, like to a gooſe quill, well knowne to all Chirurgians, ingendred in freſh water, pondes, pooles, of the which there are two ſortes, the one maligne, as thoſe which are bread in rotten ſtanding water, where carrion hath bene caſt, of the which come great accidentes, as tumor, inflamation, vlcers, apoſtumes venenous, as we reade of one Meſſelinus, who dyed by putting one on his knee. Therefore wee muſt abſtayne from thoſe, that haue the head greater then the reſt of the body, and are greene coloured, glittering, with blew rayes on the backe, the reſt of the bodie being blacke: we muſt chuſe ſuch as are found in cleane water, in pondes and ſandie ground, that haue their head little and bodies ſmall, round,Arnoldus de villa noua.

Theodocritus. chaunging the water once in x. dayes, wee vſe them for the ſame purpoſe, as ſcarrifications, and in ſuch places where ventouſes cannot bee applied, as in the lippes, gummes, legges, fundament, mouth of the matrix, & ſuch partes as are emptie of fleſhe, as noſe, fingers, toes, alſo about olde vlcers, and apoſtumes of the emunctoires and others that are venenous, rubbing the parte ye put them on, till it grow redde.Albucraſis lib. 11.

ſoftly, not touching them with the bare hand, hold their head to the part you would haue them bite, for the more eaſie doing thereof, we put a drop of Pigeons or Chickins blood, on the part, or pricke the part a little to cauſe the blood to come out, then if you would haue them drawe much, cut the endes of them with the ſheeres to let the blood runne, otherwiſe, when they fall of, apply freſhe in their place, or put on twoo or three in the begining▪ as ye find expedient. To make them fall ſooner, yee ſhall put a corne of ſalt, or drop of vineger on their heade, or a fewe ceudres, or ſeperate them with a horſe haire. If after the fall, the place bleede much, wee apply cotton, or burnt cloth, or cloth wet in cold water, or halfe a beane clouen and bound on it. If there be venenoſitie in the part,Albuc. lib. 5. after they fall we foment the place with water and ſalt, ſometime a cornet, or little ventouſe.

They muſt be done with a cloth or ſponge, firſt ſoftly and eaſily, ſometime to continue till the fleſh ſwell & become red, and may be done at all times, and chiefly in the morning, begining at the lower parts, ſo to aſcend to the head, which is accompted generall rubbing.

                     The firſt Chapter, of medimentes in Generall.
                     
                        IN this Treatiſe, we will ſpeake of diuers ſorts of medicaments comonly vſed by the Chigians the which we ſhall firſt ſhew the definition and diuiſion of euery on ſeuerallye both ſimples and compoſed, whereof they proceede and take their originall, as of plantes, trees, beaſtes, earth or ſea. Of the partes of plantes, as of the leaues, flowers, bark, roote, ſeede, gumme, iuice or oyles. Of beaſts as of Vipers, Serpents, Cantarides, Froggs, Cats, or of the diſſimilare parts of beaſtes, as the Liuer, Lightes, Hart, or Braines, alſo of the excrementes, as of the Haire, Hornes, Dung and ſuch like. Of mineralls or earth, as Stones, Mettells, as Orpiment, Sandaracha, Sulphur, Cadmia, Litarge, Quick ſiluer, Argent, Calcites. Of the Sea and waters, as all kinde of Salt, Sponges, Asphaltrum, Nitre, Amber, Bitumen, Piſſaphalen, Garinum, Alcionium. The compoundes may bee made of theſe ſimples diuers wayes, as oyles, Vnguents, Liniments, Cerates, Cataplaſmes, Emplaſters, diſtilled water, Fomentatiōs, Vaporatiōs, Suffumigatiōs, Gargariſmes, Bathes & ſuch like, but for the better

vnderſtanding of this matter, we ſhall ſhew the degrees of medicamentes, and next the meaſure and weight. There are foure degrees of medicines, hot, cold, drie and humide, and haue foure qualities, as heating, cooling, drying, and humecting▪ but not manifeſtly, and ſo little, as is ſcarſely knowne by the ſenſe. The ſecond degree is heating, cooling, drying, humecting manifeſtly, as is apparent to the iudgement. The thirde degree is heating, cooling, drying and humecting, offending the ſenſes, but not extreamely. The fourth degree is hot, burning, and maketh a ſcarce and corrupteth the ſenſes, as quicke lyme, all cauſtickes actuall and potentiall, colde, which mortifieth and obtundeth the ſenſes, as opium and all ſtupefactiues, or drie, which burne like Canters actuall: humide is not ſo vehement, as the others, for humiditie is not vehement, except it bee ioyned with colde, of the which Galen hath made no mention. After this manner the medicamentes were put in degrees, before Galen, as reporteth Dioſcorides.

                        HYppocrates the ſonne Heraclides, as Galen doth affirme in the firſt Booke of Regiment of hot feuers, but as others ſayth the ſonne Eſclepius, was bred and borne in the Iſle Cos, his Maiſter and Inſtructor was the great Pythagoras. His natural inclination was towardes good, for hee hated, loathed, and abhorred all pompe and worldly pleaſures, and venerral luſts. He conſtrained alſo his ſchollers by an oath to bee ſilent and keepe taciturnitie, modeſtie, affabilitie, and humilitie, aſwell in manners as in apparell St. Hierome teſtifieth. He reſtored the ſcience of Phiſick being almoſt loſt Fiue H

                     ndreth yeares viz. ſince the time of Eſculapius. Hee was little in bodie & ſtature, but faire and exceeding well fauoured: he had a good & ſtrōg head: he went ſlowlie and ſoftly: he was verie penſiue and of fewe wordes: hee was no great eater nor glutton: hee liued 95. yeares, he vſed oftentimes this ſentence. He that will liue in libertie let him not deſire that which he cannot obtaine, and he who would haue that which hee deſireth and couereth let him deſire nothing but that which hee may obtaine. Furthermore he who would liue peaceably in this mortall life, let him conforme himſelfe to him who is inuited to a feaſt who giueth thanks for all which is layd before him, and grudgeth not at any thing which is omitted. He liued in the time of Eliachim, of Malachias, of Pereno and Socrates.

                     I 
                     Hyppocrates vow, promiſe and proteſt to the great God Appollo and his twoo Daughters Higine and Panadie, and alſo to all the gods and goddeſſes to obſerue the the contents of this oath, or tables wherin this oath is carued, written or ingraued, ſo far as I can poſſible, and ſo farre as my wit or vnderſtanding ſhall be able to direct me viz that I yeild my my ſelfe tributarie and debtor to the Maiſter & Doctor who hath inſtructed mee and ſhewed mee this ſcience and Doctrine, euen as much or rather more then to my Father who hath begotten me, and that I ſhal liue and communicate with him and follow him in all neceſſities, which I ſhall know him to haue ſo far as my power ſhall permit, and my goods ſhall extend. Alſo that I ſhall loue and cheriſh his children as my brothers, and his progeny as mine own. Further that I ſhall teach, ſhew & demonſtrate the ſayde ſcyence gratis without rewarde or couenant, and that I ſhall giue all the Cannons rules and precepts, freely, truely, and faithfully to my Maiſter his children as to myne owne, without 
                        •
                     yding or concealing any thing, and to all other Schollers who ſhall make the ſame oth or proteſtation and to no others. Alſo that in practiſing and vſing my ſcience towardes the ſicke▪ I ſhall vſe onelye thinges neceſſarye ſo farre as I am able and as my ſpirit and good vnderſtanding ſhall giue vnto mee and

that I ſhal cure the ſicke as ſpeedie as I may, without dilating or prolonging the Maladie. And that I ſhall not doe any thing againſt equitie, for hatred, anger, enuie or malice to any perſon whatſoeuer: Moreouer that I ſhall miniſter no poyſon, neither counſell nor teach poyſon, nor the compoſing thereof to any: Alſo that I ſhall not giue nor cauſe to giue nor conſent that any thing be applyed to a woman breeding or bigge with childe, to deſtroy or make her voyd her fruite. But I proteſt to keepe my Life and Science purely, ſincerely and inuiolably, without deceipt fraude or guile. And that I ſhall not cutte nor inciſe any perſon hauing the ſtone, but ſhal leaue the ſame to thoſe that are expert in it: and furthermore, I ſhall not enter into the Patients houſe, but with purpoſe to heale him: & that I ſhall patiently ſuſtaine the iniuries, reproches and lothſomneſſe of ſicke men, and all other baſe raylings: and that I ſhall eſchewe as much as I may, all venerious laſciuiouſneſſe. Moreouer I proteſt, be it man, woman, maiſter or ſeruant, who is my Patient, to cure them of all thinges that I may ſee or heare either in minde or manners, and I ſhal not bewray that which ſhould be concealed & hidden, but keepe inuiolable ſilence, neither reueale any creature vnder paine of death. And therefore I beſeeche our Gods, that obſeruing this Proteſtation,Heere Hippocrates ſheweth that the place of bleſſed is eternall, and the paine of the wicked infinite promiſe and vow intirely and inuiolably, that all thinges in my life, in my Art and Science may ſucceed ſecurely, healthfully and proſperouſly to me, and in the ende eternall glory. And to him that ſhall violate, tranſgreſſe or become periured, that the contrary may happen vnto him viz. miſerie, calamitie & eternal maladies.

                     Prologue.
                     
                        ANy Medicine Chirurgian deſiring to purchaſe glory & honour, the loue of the people, and ſome wealth by his Science, ought to ſhew himſelfe ſkilfull & expert, and that by declaring to the Patients the ſignes paſt, preſent & future of their Maladies, and ſhewing the thinges ouer paſt by the ſicke men, and aduertiſing or reducing to their memory things forgotten: which the ſicke perſons knowing will the more confidently commit themſelues to their hands, preſuming and thinking that he hath generall knowledge of all Maladies, and that they ſhall be ſpedily cured, the which is true: For hauing ſuch knowledge of things paſt, preſent, & future, he may more eaſily helpe the Maladies although it be impoſſible to any Medicine Chirurgian to cure and heale all diſeaſes: for it ſhould be a greater thing then to foretell the future accidents. For it ſometimes happeneth that t
                           ••
                        e ſicke die by the violence or malignitie of the Maladie before the Phiſitian be called: ſome die ſhortly after the Chirurgian is arriued, the ſame day: alſo one or twoo dayes after before that by his ſcience and diligence he may correct and take away the perill and dangerous accidēts. Therefore he ought to endeuour and enforce him to knowe the nature and peruerſitie of ſuch ſicknes, alſo the ſtrength of the ſicke to the end hee may auoyde defamations, opprobries and reproches: which he ſhall doe and make himſelfe

admirable and more deuine then humane, preſaging death to one, health to another, hauing likewiſe regarde to the qualitie, goodnes and malignitie of the aire as wee particuler, vz. which circumuirons the ſicke as the vniuerſall, & the times on their qualities and the yeare, alſo the good & euill aſpects of celeſtiall bodies, which foreſeing hee ſhall eſchew diſhonour, and ſhall get renowne and freinds.
                  
                  
                     ¶ Here he beginneth to Preſage by ſignes of the Face.
                     
                     
                        NOw to foretell well, to foreſee or preſage by ſignes in dangerous & vehement Maladies. It is requiſite to conſider & contemplate the Face of the ſicke. Firſt to knowe if it be ſuch as in health, or but a litle difference: and if it be ſo, the medicine Chirurgian may haue a good preſagement and hope of Recouerie. But if it be greatlie altered and changed as followeth, hee ſhall eſteame it perill and danger of death, when the noſe and noſtrels are extenuated and ſharpened by the ſame Malady, and the eyes hollow, and the temples viz. the parts betweene the eares and forehead are leane, and the ſkinne of the brow is hard, dry, and looſe, and the eares cold and ſhronke, or almoſt doubled, and all the face appeareth black, pale, liuide, or leaden and greatly deformed, in reſpect of that which it was in time of health: When theſe things before mentioned appeare in the Face, or the moſt part of them, In the beginning or firſt daies of the Maladie he muſt enquire (if he cannot knowe by any other token) if it happen not by watching too much, viz. that the Patient hath not had time nor opportunitie to ſleepe, or if he hath had a naturall flux of the belly, or if the ſaid thinges haue happened by famine: for if it be ſo, he ought not to feare danger. On the contrarie, if the Face

appeare ſuch and continue, and the Patient ſaith that the ſaid things doe not proceed of watching, looſenes of body, nor by faſting, the Medicine Chirurgian may aſſuredly preſage death approching and if the maladie hath already continued three or foure daies, after hauing conſidered that as is aboue mentioned it behooued him to contemplate by other ſignes, as by the eyes and other parts of the body.
                  
                  
                     To preſage by the ſignes of the Eyes and Lippes.
                     
                     JF the Eies cannot ſee the day or light, and weepe or powre out teares againſt nature, and againſt the Patients will: Alſo when it ſeemeth that they are like to fall out of the head, or that the one is euidently giuen leſſe or diminiſhed, or that the white of the eyes is red, and the vaines appeare red or liuide, or that they are bleared or dimme, or trembling and very moueable, or deepe & ſonck in: alſo when the ſick becommeth ſquint eyed and looketh ouer thwart, and hath a terrible and obſcure looke, and hath the viſage all diſfigured & fearefull: all theſe ſignes are pernicious and mortall. Alſo when the Patient ſleepeth with his eyes halfe open (he doth not ſo by cuſtome) and the white of the eye ſhew it ſelfe, the eye lids being onely cloſed, and this happeneth not by the flux of the body, nor by laxatiue medicines, it is a ſigne of death. Alſo when the eye lids, the lips, and noſe ſeeme to be crooked and drawen awry, alſo mortified and liuide: theſe ſignes with the preceding foretell death to the ſicke. Likewiſe when the lips are leane, hanging downe, colde and pale, againſt the nature of the ſicke, the Medicine Chirurgian may preſage and prognoſticate death to approch.
                  
                  
                     To preſage by the maner of Lying and Repoſing.
                     
                     AS for Lying it is a very good ſigne when the Patient repoſeth and reſteth on the right ſide or left at his

eaſe hauing his hands vpon his ſtomack or elſewhere, not being ſtiffe, nor his legs but flexible, and to repoſe as in health is beſt. For to lie with neck, hands, & feet ſtifly extended and vnflexible is an euill ſigne. Likewiſe when the ſicke turneth, wrings and toſſeth vp & downe often times with ſtarting either in ſleepe or waking, and making the beds feet where the head ſhould be, caſting himſelfe down, not knowing what he doth, is an euill ſigne: Alſo if hee often vncouer himſelfe hauing no great heat in the extremities, & that he caſteth forth his armes, legs, feet & head, ſōtime on this ſide, ſomtime on that, it is a ſigne that he is in great anguiſh & diſtreſſe: alſo it is a pernitious ſigne to ſleepe with the mouth open contrarie to nature: likewiſe to ſleepe with the face vpward hauing the legs enterlaced and folded together as it were cords, and that by the force and violence of the Maladie, is a bad ſigne, or when they are much enlarged againſt reaſon. Likewiſe he that ſleepeth contrarie to nature & cuſtome with the belly downeward laid cloſe to the bed, ſheweth and ſignifieth confuſion and alienation of ſences, or great rage & dolor of the belly. Alſo whoſoeuer in the day of Critication and force of the Maladie conſtraines and forceth himſelfe to riſe & ſit vpright, and is impatient, puts himſelfe in danger, and it is an euill ſigne in all vehement & great Maladies, but worſe in pulmonick paſſions.

And when the breath iſſueth out of the mouth & noſtrils very cold, it foretels great perill of death. But gentle Reſpiration in any hot Maladie being ioyned and accompanied with a Feuer is ſigne of health in thoſe that do end in fortie daies.

And if it happen not in the ſame day & be not vniuerſall, it is no good ſigne. For the mortall Sweat is particular & cold as in the forehead, in the head or face only, and this in the burning Feuer and other Maladies declareth continuance of the Maladie.

But if there be dolour, tumor, hardneſſe, or Inflammation on both ſides, or on the one more then the other, it is an euill ſigne. For if he feele great motion or pulſacion in one of the ſides, one may prognoſticate great diſtreſſe and dolour, or alienation and confuſion of Reaſon. If with this pulſation the eyes be very moueable, the Patient is in danger of Frenſie and to be franticke, or to deſtroy himſelfe.

                     THe Collection of Apoſtume in a burning Maladie vnder both the ſides with tumor and dolour, is more dangerous then vnder one of the ſides onely, and chiefly leſſe dangerous vnder the left ſide then vnder the right: and if the Patient die not in the firſt daies, and if it continue xx. daies and the feuer ceaſe not, nor the Apoſtume diminiſh, it is a ſigne that it ſhall come to maturation, and if it happen on the ſeauenth daie with the flux of blood at the noſe, it eaſeth well, which the Medicine Chirurgian may prognoſticate when the Patient ſaith that he hath paine in the head or forehead, and that his eies are dimme or obſcure, & chiefly when the Patient doe not exceed 30 or 35 yeeres of age. And when the collection or Apoſtume is ſoft and without dolour, and moueth or varieth when it is handled, it requireth longer time to be cured then the precedent, but it is not ſo dangerous. And if it continue 60 daies, and the Feuer ceaſe not, neither the tumor diminiſh, it ſhall come to maturation and purgation: you ſhall prognoſticate ſo much of Apoſtumes in the belly: the Apoſtume then

being hard, great, and with dolour, is dangerous & mortall: The ſoft without dolour and volable from one place to another, is of longer continuance, but without compariſon leſſe dangerous.

It is then conuenient to conſider that the forenamed Collections or Apoſtumes come by diuers meanes to putrefaction or purgation, for ſome purge altogether outwardly and are little, round, and ſharpe or pointed, they are moſt healthfull and feaſt mortall: The ſarge, groſſe, and flat, ſpatious and not round nor ſharpe, are dangerous: and thoſe which breake and purge within the belly, although they make ſome tumors outwardly, are more pernicious & dangerous, then thoſe which make no imminence outwardly, and which haue not the ſkinne diſcoloured.

                  ALl manner of Hydropſie with the hot feuer, is dangerous and mortall: For the Patient is moleſted and afflicted by any vehement feuer and grieuous dolour, and therefore dieth. This Maladie often proceedeth of the Hepatick paſſion which is the Maladie of the Liuer: It hapneth alſo by paſſions in the Guts, Inteſtines, and Entrals, Meſeraick, raynes or melt, & inferiour parts: That which comes by the Entrals or Meſeraick and inferiour parts, is knowne by Inflation in the feet and by long and continuall flux of the body, albeit the dolor of the belly is not mitigated nor appeaſed, nor the belly diminiſhed nor growen leſſe. That which proceeds of the Liuer, is known by the ſignes following, viz, the Patient hath a drie cough and ſpitteth almoſt nothing, and his belly is hard & bound in ſuch ſort that there cometh nothing from it, but with great paine and trauell: alſo his feet are ſwollen: Moreouer there are tumors and inflations ſometime on the right ſide, ſometime on the left: then they depart and diſſipate, that is, they goe and retourne.

                     WHen the Patient is cold in the head, hands and feete, and that the ſides and belly are burning & vehement hot, it is a ſigne of an euill and dangerous Malady. But when the ſicke perſon doth eaſily turne himſelfe from one

ſide to another without trouble: alſo when all the body is equally hot, and ſauourie, it is a ſigne of ſalubritie. On the contrarie ſide, when all the members are heauy, as the armes, legges, and all the body, it is to be feared. And if the Nailes be therewith liuide or leaden, one may prognoſticate Death approaching. But if the Nailes, fingers and feet be altogether black, it is not ſo dangerous a ſigne eſpecially when any other good ſigne doth appeare, as if the Patient feele no great dolour, and beareth it ſtrongly, and endureth his ſicknes without anguiſh, albeit that which is black will fall away, and the dimme will be euacuated by Apoſtume.

                     AS for ſleeping and ſlumbring, the one is naturall and healthfull, and the other vnnaturall and vitious. The naturall reſt is taken in the night and waking in the day: And although it is not altogether wholeſome to ſleepe frō the breake of the day to 8 or 9 of the clocke at morning, yet notwithſtanding it is more profitable then to ſleepe in the reſt of the day: But if one neither ſleepe by night nor day, it is dangerous and a ſigne of great dolour, of folly, of alienation of ſences, reaſon and vnderſtanding preſent or future.

                     AS for eaſing of the Belly and euacuating of ſuperfluities and excrements, it is beſt when the ſicke perſon follow the cuſtome in Maladies which they did in health, and eſpecially according to qualitie and quantitie of his diet. For how much the more it is diſſonant and different, it is ſo much the worſe. The naturall egeſtion ought not to be too liquide or aduſt, but indifferently proportioned & compounded in colour to the meates, and that the Patient goe to ſtoole without paine or dolour. And if the matter be liquide, it is not altogether to be diſliked when it comes without ventoſitie or violence, & not often in a ſhort time. For ſo it would make the perſon weake, debile, froward, and in danger of ſwoonding, and death: It is alſo to be allowed about the end of the Maladie, that the egeſtion & excrementall matter become thicke and not too dry and of a good colour, as drawing neere to red or browne, and be not very vnſauorie. Alſo if there come foorth wormes about the end of the ſicknes with the excrements, it is a good ſigne. Likewiſe in euery Maladie the belly ought to be fleſhie and not round, nor full of wind, otherwiſe it is no good ſigne. Furthermore the egeſtion and excrementall matter being liquide and waterie, white or pale, greatly red or froathy, is dangerous: the mortall is black and liuide or greene, vnſauorie and ſlimy. And if it be of diuers of the forenamed colours together, it is no leſſe dangerous but of longer continuance: alſo when there is peeling of the guts or Carnuncles and little ſkinne, all ſuch are mortall.

ſtrayning the Fundament and inferiour partes, is the beſt and moſt wholeſome. That which cometh foorth vnconſtrained making a noyſe is better then to retaine it. But if it goeth out with ſound and noyſe againſt the Patients will, it ſignifieth dolorous tortion in the belly, or alienation and confuſion of reaſon.

                        itie of ſicknes & leſſe ſecuritie, and the more it differs from the firſt, the worſe it is. The Vrine being red or high coloured with the Hypoſtaſie or light and equall reſidence ſignifieth the Maladie to bee longer then the precedent where there is no Hypoſtaſie, but leſſe dangerous. Alſo when there is groſſe Reſolutions as bran or duſt in the bottome of the Vrine, it is an euill ſigne, and worſe where they are like ſcales of fiſhe. The Vrine white and ſubtile is exceeding bad, albeit the forementioned is worſe where there is groſſe reſolutions. The cloude hanging in the Vrine ſignifieth ſecuritie if it be white, for the black is dangerous:

moreouer the Vrine being yellow and very cleare and ſubtill in the Maladie ſheweth continuitie of ſickneſſe, groſſe in digeſtion and crudity. Therefore it is to be feared leaſt the ſick perſon decay before the humors come to perfect concoction, and leaſt the Patient die. The Vrine ſignificatiue of certaine death & vnfallible is vnſauourie, ſlimy and muddy, as dirt and myre, and is tauny, browne, black, and thick. Furthermore the blacke as well in man as woman is alwaies bad, and the ſubtle and the cleare as water is alſo mortall in little children. The Vrine being raw, cleare and vndigeſted, perſeuering ſo long in the maladie without other euill ſignes, but with good and healthfull, ſheweth a future Apoſtume lower then the Diaphragme or ribbes: The Vrine hauing as it were a cobweb ſwimming aboue ſignifieth that the perſon ſhall die, Dry and etick ſheweth conſumption of the body: you muſt alſo conſider the place and colour of the cloude, for if it be neere the bottome of the Vrine it is a good ſigne hauing the colour neere vnto white. And if it be ſwimming aboue and on the top and blacke, it is dangerous and vncertaine. Finally as for the Iudgement of Vrines, take heed aboue all that you be not deceiued by the Bladder: For they may appeare ſuch by the diſeaſes of it: And if the Bladder bee not diſeaſed, thy iudgement ſhalbe certaine, therefore take heed.

Likewiſe if it be vnſauourie with one of theſe forenamed colours, it ſignifieth death approching: For the Ius is vitious in all vomiting and euery excrement.

The blacke aboue all is mortall moreuoer when the matter which ought to be purged by ſpitting, remaineth within the Lights & troubleth the wind-pipe, there is no ſecuritie: The ſpittle alſo being cleare or red, ſanguinolent in apoſtume & pulmonick inflation comming in the beginning of the malady promiſeth in the firſt dayes ſecurity & health to the patient. But if ſuch egeſtion continue to the ſeauenth day or more it is ſuſpitious & vncertaine. Alſo ſpittle whereby the dolor doth not ceaſe but perſeuer is not commendable but vitious.

                     SOme Apoſtumes breake and appeare on the 20 day, others differ vnto 40, others to 60 daies. Therefore to preſage well thou ſhalt enquire out the firſt day and the beginning of the Maladie, viz, when the Patient did firſte feele heate and the feuer, alſo ſtifneſſe and ſtanding vp of the haire, heauines, and alſo dolour and pricking: Then thou ſhalt begin to reckon the daies, and by this meanes thou maiſt prognoſticate infallibly. Thou ſhalt alſo preſage if there be Apoſtume on the one ſide or both by this meanes: aſke the Patient if he feele dolour on the one ſide more then the other, then cauſe him to lie on the ſide which is ſound, and if he feele heauineſſe and ponderoſitie, it followeth, that the ſame ſide where the ponderoſitie is, is Apoſtumed, and there is the collection and matter: and if he feele dolour, heate, and heauines on both, it will follow, that both ſides are Apoſtumed: Thou ſhalt knowe the Apoſtume and collection to be ripe and broken, and the matter retayned in the part Apoſtumed, when the feuer doth not ceaſe, and it is leſſe by day then night, and that the Patient ſweates aboundantly, and ceaſeth not to cough, and voides not almoſt any thing: likewiſe if his eyes ſinke in his head, and cheekes are red, the nailes crookes, & the ends and extremities of the fingers turne, and the appetite

decayeth, and the feete ſwell, and there is almoſt through all the body pimples and puſtules, theſe ſignes do appeare when the matter and Apoſtume is of longe continuance, & are certaine ſignes of future health. Therefore to prognoſticate whether the Apoſtume will breake ſoone or late, conſider that ſpoken of before: for if the cough in the beginning and firſt daies doe oppreſſe the ſicke perſon with dolour and often ſpitting and egeſtion with difficultie of breth, I iudge that the Apoſtume will breake within 20 daies, and if the contrarie happen that the ſignes be hindered, the rupture will be prolonged: and as the ſignes bee ſtrong or feeble, ſo the ruption is inueterated or ſhortened. And to know if there be perill or danger, or probabilitie of health, conſider the day whereon the Apoſtume breakes, if the feuer and thirſt ceaſe, and the appetite returne, and if the fecall matter be ſolide, & if the matter of the Apoſtume be white and equally ſoft, and come foorth without doloure and without coughing: theſe things are faithfull ſignes of health. Otherwiſe when the feuer doth not ceaſe, or preſently retourne with great thirſt, without appetite, and the fecall matter be watery, the ſpittle liuide, greene, and ſlimie, and in part phlegmatick, thou mayeſt prognoſticate death. And if there happen ſome good ſignes, ſome bad compare the one with the other, and diligently aduiſe before thou preſage, to the end thou maieſt auoide infamy. For ſome die preſently, others are prolonged and then die in the end, others at length retourne to their health.
                  
                  
                     ¶ To Preſage of Apoſtumes that come about the Eares in pulmonick paſſions.
                     WHen the Apoſtume happeneth betweene or vnder the Eares to the ſicke perſon with difficultie of b
                           ••
                        ath and that the ſame Apoſtume cometh to maturation and purgeth and ingendereth a Fiſtule, it ſaueth the Patient. And

to prognoſticate when it will come, note this which followeth: when the Feuer continueth in the ſaid Maladie, and the colour is permanent, the Spittle impertinent and not commendable, and the belly doe not his dutie, euacuating the choller or liquide matter, and the Vrine is in ſmall quantitie with aboundance of Reſidence, but all other good ſignes ſhewing ſecuritie are preſent, then thou ſhalt preſage the future Apoſtumes to be neere the Eare, eſpeciallie when there is Inflammation vnder the ſides and Diaphragme. And if there be no Inflammation nor doloure in the ſaid place, but the Patient hath difficultie of breath, the which goeth away without manifeſt cauſe, then the Apoſtume comes aboue the Eare.
                  
                  
                     ¶ To Preſage of Puſtules or Apostumes that come in the Feet.
                     
                     JN vehement and perillous Maladies of the Lights, there happeneth for the profit and health of the Patient little puſtules in the Feet, and eſpecially when the ſpitle is ſodainlie changed from red to white, it is a moſt certaine ſigne of health, for by ſuch ſpittle the puſtule and dolour ceaſeth, but if the ſpittle turne not frō red to white, and that the Vrine be not good, nor the Reſidence commendable, the Patient ſhall be in danger to become lame by contraction of the nerues and iointures where the ſame puſtule is. If the ſaid puſtule or little Apoſtume in the feete be hidden and vaniſh away, or that it goe and come without purgation or maturation: Or els if the Apoſtume in the ſide called Periplineumonia (for it is in the Lights) be not purged by commendable ſpittle, and that the Feuer remaine, the Patient is in daunger to looſe his vnderſtanding, & therafter to die. Furthermore of the aforeſaid pulmonick maladies thoſe which are aged, but not extremely (as of 50 yeres) die more often then they who are yonger.

And young perſons die moſt commonly of another kinde of Apoſtume: Moreouer the perſon hauing great doloure in the belly lower then the Nauill, or drawing neere vpon the thigh with any feuer: if the dolour leauing his place, doe aſcend vp towards the Ribbes, it is very dangerous. For then one or two euill ſignes doe foreſhew death, but if there be many good, as eaſie ſpitting, white and not vnſauourie, it is a ſigne of euaſion: the red and vnſauourie is mortall: and if there be not any euill ſigne, there is hope that the thing will come to ſuppuration and matter.
                  
                  
                     ¶ To Preſage by the ſignes of the Bladder.
                     
                     THe hardneſſe and great dolour of the Bladder is mortall ſpecially with quotidian feuer, and it is often with conſtipation, therefore it is mortall without Remiſſion: But if the Vrine be like the matter of the Apoſtume with Reſidence white and pointed, and thereby the dolour ceaſeth, there is hope. But if the dolour be not aſſwaged, and the bladder mollified, and the feuer taken away, by ſuch Vrine iudge preſent death: and this happeneth more to Children of Seauen or Foureteene yeeres of age, than to any others.

                  THE THIRD BOOKE OF Preſages of deuine Hippocrates.
                  
                     To preſage of Feuers.
                     
                     THE End of the Feuer happeneth to one, and that with death, and to an other with life in the ſame day. And if it tende vnto life, all good ſignes doe appeare in the firſt dayes, whereby thou ſhalt prognoſticate the end in the 4. day or before. And if the Feuer be mortall, all euill ſignes giue notice of death in the 4. day or before the firſt period and day of iudgement or cretication, and the ende or tearme of the Feuer is (as we haue ſaid) in the 4. day: the ſecond on the ſeuenth: the ſixt on the 20 day, the which nomber doth augment by quaternaries and is produced to the 20. day in the Feuer and hotte maladies, and they ought to be nombred by whole quaternaries. For the yeere and moneth cannot be counted by nomber of whole & complete dayes, as by this computation, wee make three weekes of 20. dayes, which is called one moneth or yeere of the Moone. So after this computation and augmentation, the firſt ſhall be the 20. day, the ſecond the 40. day, the third the 60. day, and it is to bee noted, that the cronile maladies are of long continuance, and of more difficill indicature, knowledge and prognoſtication. Therefore it muſt be looked vnto more exactly. For their beginninges are ſecret and ſhewe no ſigne of digeſtion. If therefore you will diligently contemplate it you ſhalbe able to prognoſticate to what ende the Feuer ſhall come. Likewiſe the quartan Feuer obſerueth the foreſaid matter in his cretications and iudicatures or weekes of Iudgement. For that which is done in others by nomber of dayes, in this is

done by nomber of ſittes and periods. The ſhort & briefe maladies are of more eaſie preſagement and knowledge. For it chaungeth preſently, & in the firſt dayes from good to better, or from badde to worſe. The healthfull ſignes are knowne by this, that the patient hath good eaſie breath and feeles no dolour, and ſleepes in the night, and other holſome ſignes. The mortall or dangerous are knowne, when the patient hath difficultie of breath & great dolour, and reſteth not in the night, with other badde ſignes, whereby one may prognoſticate death▪ To the ende thou mayeſt preſage well, thou ſhalt conſider all the ſignes of digeſtion, the time, houres and dayes in which the ſicke are moſt afflicted. And if the Maladie happen to women in childbirth, or ſoone after they be deliuered, beginne to reckon from the day of her deliuerie, and not from the day wherein the feuer began. Alſo to ſpeake generally, when one feeles vehement dolour in the head continue with any Feuer. If there happen any euill ſigne with the foreſaide, it is a ſigne of death. But if the dolour and feuer continue and perſeuer to the 20. day, thou mayeſt preſage fluxe of bloud at the noſe or apoſtumes in the inferiour partes of the body if there be no other ſigne. Sometime alſo there happeneth in the beginning & firſt daies fluxe of bloud at the noſe or apoſtumes principally when the dolor is in the forehead & parts neere adioyning. And it is to be noted, that the ſaid fluxe of bloud happeneth moſt often to perſons of 30 or 35. yeers of age. And apoſtumes or collections to thoſe which are elder. Alſo if the patient in the continuall feuer hath great dolour and apoſtumes in the eare, it is a dangerous ſigne. For often times the perſon looſeth his vnderſtanding and dyeth. Therefore one ought well to ſpeculate the good and euill ſignes in the beginning of the maladie: for young perſons ſicke of this maladie, doe often die in ſeuen dayes: But olde perſons die not ſo ſoone. For the Feuer cannot bee ſo hotte in them, nor the alienation of the ſpirit ſo vehement. Therefore the Apoſtume commeth to maturation, ſuppuration

and mattir: But if olde perſons haue the relapſe, they cōmonly die. And the yong die before that the Apoſtume of the eare come to maturation, except that which commeth forth be white & digeſted with other good ſignes, then they recouer their health. Alſo if there happen in the continuall feuer and hotte maladie, vlceration of the throat or windpipe, it is moſt dangerous and badde, eſpecially when there happeneth other maligne and mortall ſignes.
                  
                  
                     To Preſage of the Squinancie.
                     
                     ALl manner of Squinancie is dangerous, for it killeth the perſon preſently, eſpecially when there is no appearance of apoſtume or tumor vpon the necke or in the throat and that hee ſuffereth grieuous dolour, and cannot aſpire nor reſpire or drawe his breath. Then it killeth the patient in the firſt, ſecond, thirde or fourth day at the furtheſt. Alſo when eminence and great redneſſe appeareth with vehement dolour, it is no leſſe dangerous but more tardy and of longer continuance. But where there is eminence and redneſſe vpon the necke or throat, but eſpecially in the breaſt, it is more tardy and leſſe dangerous then the 2. ſuperior kinds. And if it do not hide it ſelfe and go in againe, it is a good ſigne. But if the ſaid Squinancie & tumor doth augment in the day of cretication, & that it do not purge outwardly or by the ſpittle, although the diſeaſed perſon feele himſelfe eaſed and without great dolour: it is an euill ſigne and mortall, or ſigne of Relapſe. It is It is then a better ſigne and leſſe dangerous when the tumor and redneſſe appeareth outwardly. For if it deſcend vnto the lightes, the patient is in danger to looſe his vnderſtanding although ſometimes the ſaid collection come to ſuppuration, mattir and purgation.

Therefore one muſt labour to heale and cure the patient by ſome other meanes. And if he cannot, & that it be liuide or pale and that the ſuperiour part be little and not tumified nor ſwollen, but the inferiour parte tumified and rounde, you may without danger inciſe and open it, and ſo cure it. And if you knowe that the patient is not in daunger to fall into ſuffocation and ſo die, the chiefe thing ſhall be to purge the belly, if you haue the oportunitie and time.
                  
                  
                     Here that deuine Hippocrates returneth to ſpeake of feuers
                     WHen the hotte Feuer doth not ceaſe nor giue reſt to ye Patient in one or moe dayes of cretication, without other good ſignes thou mayeſt prognoſticate Relapſe. And in the Feuer with healthfull Signes, as when the patient is not moleſted with great dolour nor labour, & there is no other manifeſt cauſe, thou mayeſt prognoſticate apoſtume and inflamation in the winters and inferiour partes and ſpeacially to thoſe who do not exceed 30. or 35. yeeres.

And as the foreſaid apoſtume doeth happen moſt often to young perſons, ſo the quartan feuer happeneth to men and women that are in yeeres. And as for the nature of the Apoſtumes, they doe moſt vſually and

commonly happen in winter but are moſt ſlow and prolixe and leſſe ſubiect to relaxe.

And to preſage moſt apparantly when the dolor of the head moleſteth the perſon in the firſt day of the feuer & be augmēted the fourth or fift day, the feuer will end on the ſeauenth & the perſon ſhall be cured. And if the dolor begin the third day & augment in the fift or ſeauenth, the feuer ſhall end the Nynth or eleauenth day.

                     The Concluſion of the whole Booke.
                     NOwe then for finall concluſion let the Mediciner, Chirurgion and Phiſitian labour to know the ſicke perſons and maladies: alſo the good and holeſome, the euil and mortall accidentes of them, as well in young folks as old, and in all infirmities, eſpecially feuers, to the ende to preſage life to one and death to another: alſo the breuitie and prolixitie of euery maladie and the tranſmutations and other inconueniences, collecting & accumulating all ſignes good and bad, and conſidering & comparing the ſuperiour and inferiour, which are able to ouerthrowe or ſaue the patient, and that by vrine, fecall matter, ſpittle, ſweate and other excrements & ſuperfluities comming out of the body. Moreouer let him practiſe to conſider & ſpeculate or note as well the time of dayes preſent as paſt, viz. the variation of weather by winds, colde, heate, drought and humiditie, and the condition of the whole yeere and foure partes: as the Spring, Sommer, Harueſt & Winter. For although that all maladies may happen at all times, yet ſome doe more commonly happen at one time then another. And ſome ſignes that be good or badde, come and happen rather in one day houre or moment rather then another. And to the ende thou mayeſt not doubt to preſage and prognoſticate according to the doctrine and preſcribed inſtructions, know that we haue here experimented theſe thinges in Aethiopia, Mauritania, Lybia, in the Ile of Delos, in Heſperia and Scythia, briefely in the orient, occident, ſouth and north: and haue founde it true as wee haue ſhowne. And therefore doe not deſpaire, but take courage and endeuour thy ſelfe to knowe the ſaid things, and thou ſhalt eaſily attaine to greater knowledge of things then thou canſt imagine, and ſhalt marueile howe theſe thinges can ſo well concurre and ſucceede ſo rightly. And if thou doeſt well ponderate my principles, doubt not at laſt that there can

happen any malladies to thee, whereof thou mayeſt doubt, or cannot haue the knowledge of: and that by the ſaide inſtructions, if thou doeſt vnderſtand them well, and eſpecially in theſe which obſerue dayes of affliction and maner of paroxiſme, and which ende in one certaine nomber of dayes and certaine ſpace as we haue ſaid, if thou wilt ſpeculate exactly, and take mature deliberation.
