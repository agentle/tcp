bodyes of many ſayntes / whoos merytes were prechyd in dyuerſe
places / And for to haue ſomme of them they studyred &
ſought alle the meanes they couthe / knowyng veryly / that by
the ſuffrages of ſuche one they myght the better ſerue our lord
and be kepte the better from alle aduerſytees / whoos dayly
ſeruyſe they ſhold kepe with deuocion here in this world / to
thende that he ſhold to them be a patrone in heuen / For whiche
to gete / they dylygently endeuouryd them / And trouth it
is / that ſythe many holy and excellente Confeſſours were in
the ſayd countrey / they beganne to doubte whome they myght
ſpecially deſyre and haue / ¶Hit happed afterward that one
of the bretheren of that Abbaye was oppreſſyd by grete Infyrmyte
/ And the other bretheren hauyng grete compaſſyon
on hym were ſore troublyd for his diſeaſe / And for his helth
they prayd deuoutely with the Inward deuocion of their hert
vnto god / And ſente vnto other howſes of Relygyon prayeng
them that they the ſame wyſe wold haue theyr ſeek broder
recommended in their ſpecial prayers / And ſpecially they
lete haue knowleg of the greuous Infyrmyte of hym vnto
the Monkes of the chirche of Cheſtre / And thenne they in the
ſame aſtonyed in theyr mynydes wente in to the Chirche for
to praye deuoutely for his helthe / whiche fylle doune flatte to
fore the holy Aulter / and 
                  ſayd with humble deuocion the ſeuen
pſalmes / And one of them named Randolf whiche was
Suppryour of the hows a man of good lyf and ſymple courage
fylle a ſlepe / And he ſawe by a vyſyon an excellent &

fayr virgyne ſtondynge to fore hym / whiche with a moche
pleſaunt chere ſayd to hym theſe wordes / what is this ſaid he
And for whome is it that ye thus proſtrate praye / The monke
anſwerd / It is for a broder of our ordre whiche is payned
by grete Infyrmyte / And for his helthe here we bye preſtrate
for to offre our prayers to god for his helthe / To whome ſhe
ſayd / I knowe wel ſayd ſhe that that ſame Monke ſuffreth
alienacion of his mynde / but & yf ye deſyre veryly his helthe / late
one of yow go to the welle of ſaynt wenefrede / And in
the chirche that is ther by / late hym ſaye maſſe in the remembraunce
of hir / And anone the ſeke broder ſhall be delyuerd of
his ſekenes / And this ſayeng ſhe vanyſſhed awey / The monk
awoke & comyn ageyn to hym ſelf / remembryng what be had
ſene and 
                  herd in his mynde / wold not ſhewe his vyſion to
his bretheren / dredynge to be had in ſoorne of them / & that
they wold depute for a fantaſye that he had ſene & herd / So
after this nyghe vpon a fourty dayes / the ſeke man was alwey
gretely vexyd / & lay in his bedde / And it was ſhewed
ageyne to the monkes of Cheſtre of the grete and greuous
payne that the ſayd Monke ſuffred / And for to ſpeke of hym
it gaf occacion to the monkes of Cheſtre / And after many
wordes when they bewaylled the ſeke man / he that had ſene
the vyſyon toke hardynes to hym / And 
                  told to them of by
ordrr what the holy vyrgyn had 
                  ſaid to hym / Thenne they
whiche afore tyme had 
                  herd the fame of hir / & knowyng alle
that many myracles had be done by her merytes / anone made
them lyghtely to bileue to that whiche was ſayd / and alſo
gaf faythe to the vyſyon / For ſithe they were warned to go
to her welle / and in thonoure of her to ſaye maſſe in the chirche
/ they were callyd therto by ſaynte wenefrede / And 
                  ſayd
certaynly that ſhe had appiered to the ſayd broder / Thus thenne
they takynge their counceylle to gyder / two monkes were
ſente to the welle of ſaynte wenefrede / And for to ſaye maſſe
in the chirche that was faſt by / and there to pray for the ſeke
man / And it was ſo that the ſame houre that the maſſe was
ther ſongen / the ſeke Monke at ſhreweſbury was made al hole
And 
                  thanked the ſaid Monkes for his helthe / And a lytel
whyle after / the ſame broder that had len ſeke was ladde to

the ſame place for to gyue laude and prayſynge to god 
                  and
to the holy vyrgyne for his helthe / And whanne he had fyrſt
made his prayers in the chirche / And after had dronken of
the welle / And with the water therof waſſhen / he was parfyghtely
made hole / & retorned to his monaſtery in good helth
And fro thenne forthon the memorye and remembrounce of
this holy vyrgyn / beganne tencreace more deuoutely in the hertes
of the bretheren / in ſuche wyſe that they eſtemed them bleſſyd
and happy / yf they myght haue and gete a lytel parte cerelyque
of her moſt bleſſyd body / And though this ſemed to
them hard and dyffyeyle / and ſuppoſed ſhold paſſe theyre power
/ yet they ordeyned to tempte and proue it / knowynye
that ther is nothyng may reſiſte the wylle of god / prayenge
hym that he wold be debonayr and helper to bryng their purpos
to effecte / by whoos wylle alle thynges hard diffyale &
impoſſyble withoute doubte may lyghtely be broughte by his
myght to honde / And therof they doubted not / ¶That tyme
that kynge harry the fyrſt an hyhe and excellent prynce / and
frende of pees gouerned the Royamme of Englond / by whos
auctoryte alle the yle obteyned ſurete and pees / in ſoo moche
that euery man myght go and ryde peaſybly whyder ſomeuer
he wold / By occaſion wherof the ſayd bretheren ſente meſſagers
in to wales for to knowe where the moſt and excellente
relyques reſted / and in eſpeciall to ſeche where the tombe of
the forſayd vyrgyne was / And whan they had founde that
place in whiche the bones of the bleſſyd vyrgyn wenefrede reſted / they
were gladde and 
                  fulfylled with ouer grete ioye / And
by the conſente of the Biſſhop of Banguour / in whos
dyociſe the place was / they made the prynces and noble men
of the countrey to be conſenty
                     •
                  ge and fauourable to them / This
thynge procedyng dayly forward gaf grete courage to
the bretheren that they ſhold come to thenteut of theyr deſyre
But the dethe of the forſayd kyng harry ſodenly comynge on
oppreſſyd al Brytayne by ouer grete ſtryf and trouble / and
conſtrayned them a certayne tyme to leue theyre erande and
deſyre / & the ſecond yere of kynge ſtephen the troubles ceaſed
                  and the lond reſtored to tranquyllyte and pees / ¶Thabbot
of the forſayd monaſterye by the counceylle of his bretheren

                  ordeyned for to ſende in to wales the pryour named Roberte
with another Monke his felawe named 
                  Rychard / This pryour
was moche dylygent in the procuracion of this thynge / than
the other meſſagers had ben / And ſente his lettres and
