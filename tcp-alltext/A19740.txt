The former part conteineth rules for the preſeruation of health, and preuenting of all diſeaſes vntill extreme olde age. Herein is inſerted the Authours opinion of Tabacco. The latter is a diſcourſe of Emperiks or vnlearned Phyſitians, wherein is plainly prooued that the practiſe of all thoſe which haue not beene brought vp in the Grammar and Vniuerſity, is alwayes confuſed, commonly dangerous, and often Deadly.

            THE PVBLISHER to the Reader.
            
               GEntle Reader, let it not ſeeme ſtrange that I publiſh vnto thee a priuate letter. There are three principall cauſes which haue moued me hereunto: Firſt, a world of examples both of moderne and ancient Writers, whoſe epiſtles, perhaps priuatly intended, as this was, haue now their publike vſe. Secondly, my loue vnto the Authour, a man deſeruing loue of all, but ſpecially of me, vnto whom I am beholding (next vnto God) for that health which Ienioy. Thirdly, the woorth of the worke it ſelfe; wherein, looke not for hyperbolicall phraſes, or curious affectation: for as in his life he preferreth deeds before words, ſo in his writings ſhalt thou finde more ſubſtance than ſhewes. Yet ſo hath he ioyned

profit with pleaſure, ſound diſcourſe with ſweet delight; that (if my loue deceiueth me not, and ſome learned Phyſicians, who at my requeſt haue peruſed it) as the Poet ſayth, Omne tulit punctum. His rules of health (vnto thoſe that will be ruled by them) are full of health: his diſcouery of baſtard Phyſicians will make wiſemen beware: their ignorance, their arrogancie, their raſhneſſe is here layd open: not with ieſting termes (for that he accounteth no leſſe than an artificiall iniury) but with ſuch euident demonſtrations, as he that hereafter ſhall know them, and will not eſchew them, ſhall be deemed acceſſary to his own ouerthrow. I haue named the former part Healths Preſeruatiue, and the latter, A Diſcourſe of Empiricks and vnlearned Phyſicians. I wiſh as much good to come vnto thee by this my friends labour, as was meant vnto my ſelfe. Be thine owne friend. Take heed of Empiricks. And ſo farewell.
         
      
      
         
            
            Healths Preſeruatiue.
            
               SIr, I haue here ſent you an anſwer to your kinde letters, though not ſo ſoone as you expected, yet aſſoone as my buſineſſe, and the large handling of the matter, protracted farre beyond my firſt purpoſe, would permit. Your requeſt ſtandeth vpon two ſcuerall parts: the one is, To ſet downe rules and directions out of our Art for the preſeruation ofhealth, and preuenting of diſeaſes: the other is, To deliuer my opinion concerning Empericks. Touching the former, though health be a precious thing, and the greateſt bleſſing belonging to this life, yet the meanes of preſeruing it are little thought of, and lightly regarded of moſt, that haue full fruition of it, and are in their flouriſhing yeeres. If this your requeſt proceedeth from a reſolution to obſerue thoſe things which you deſire to heare, Dignus es Neſtoris annis, & Crotonis ſalubritate: You are worthy oflong life and perfect health. Some place their felicitie in honour, ſome in wealth▪ other in other things: Hippoc. de diaeta. lib. 3.but if health be not a continuall attendant vpon theſe, this ſuppoſed happineſſe is ſoone changed into miſerie. An ancient Poet ſayth,

                  , &c.O bleſſed health, when thou art preſent, all things flouriſh as in the Spring; without thee no man is happy. To this agreeth that of Pindarus; 
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. What health is.If a man poſſeſſe riches ioyned with health, and hath with them a good report, there is no cauſe why he ſhould deſire to be a god. Health is thus defined by Galen: 
               Cont. Iulianum.
               Sanitas eſt calidi, frigidi, humidi, ſiccitemperies: an equall mixture or proportion of the foure elements: not equall by iuſt proportion ofweight of euery element alike; which is called temperatum ad pondus; but temperatum ad iuſtitiam: ſuch a proportion as is moſt agreeable to the preſeruation and continuance oflife and health; and as it were due by the right ofiuſtice.

Of theſe Galen diſcourſeth at large in the foreſaid booke: but I omit them, as things out of our power, and come to the outward, which haue equall or greater force to ouerthrow our health, if they be lightly regarded: and much vertue to preſerue vs from ſickneſſe, if we vſe them rightly. Theſe are almoſt in our power, and moſt of them may be obſerued by vs, if we endeuor Qui lib

And in another place: They which haue a good ſtate of bodie, and free tranſpiration, and vſe not too violent exerciſe, and keepe their ſtomacke and liuer warme, it is impoſſible for them to haue an ague. This warrant of ſo great a Phyſician, to liue vntill extreame olde age without any diſeaſe, may moue you to a carefull and diligent obſeruation of the rules required to this happy ſtate of life. Theſe outward things are in number ſix: The aire, meat and drinke, exerciſe and reſt, ſleepe and waking, expelling and retaining of ſuperfluities, and the affections of the mind. All theſe are in our arte compriſed vnder the name of Diet, as In Hippoc de morb. vulg. li. 3.

               Galen doth teſtifie in plaine words. Theſe are called things not naturall, becauſe they are not of the eſſence or nature of the body. They are called by Galen, Cauſae couſeruatrices, becauſe they keepe and preſerue the body in perfect health, vntill it commeth lege adraſtriae, by ineuitable fate neere the graue, being withered and conſumed for want 1. The aire.of moiſture. Of theſe ſix, the aire hath the firſt place, becauſe our life beginneth with that, and we haue a continuall vſe of it as well by night as by day, both ſleeping and waking: it is of it owne nature bot and moiſt; but it is ſubiect to many alterations from the earth, from the waters, from the windes, and from the heauens: it miniſtreth nouriſhment to the ſpirits and cooleth them, and receiueth their ſuperfluous fumes: it paſſeth by the mouth, noſe and arteries, into the braine, lungs, heart, and all parts of the body: what ſubſtance or qualities ſoeuer be in it, thoſe it infuſeth firſt into the ſpirits, then into the humours, and ſo into the whole body. Cleere, ſubtile, pure, ſweet and temperate aire lighteneth the ſpirits, clarifieth the blood, dilateth the heart, and lifteth it vp with ioy and delight: it preuenteth obſtructions, ſtirreth vp naturall heat, increaſeth appetite, perfecteth concoction, and inableth euery part to expell it ſuperfluitie at fit times. Theſe are the excellent properties, which Hippocrates, Galen, and other aſcribe vnto a good aire. De re ruſtic

               Edmunds-Bury is the moſt famous place in this country for good aire: Sol non vidit vrbemſitu elegantiorem.
               Lelandus maketh it inferiour to no citie of the world for ſituation: and the Phyſicians of Cambridge do vſually ſend their Patients diſeaſed in the lungs, to liue here; whereby many haue recouered their health. On the contrary part, groſſe, thicke and impure aire, receiuing continuall exhalations from moores, fennes, bogges, and ſuch like▪ or being barred from the benefit of the Sunne and winde by hilles, woods or other meanes, is an vtter enemie vnto health; for it oppreſſeth the heart, infecteth the lungs, dulleth the wit, diminiſheth naturall heat, hindereth appetite, weakeneth concoction, and ſubiecteth the body to many other infirmities. Therefore ſith there is ſo great power in the aire both to preſerue and ouerthrow a perfect ſtate of body, you are to haue a ſpeciall care to liue alwayes in a good aire, and alſo to auoid all obiects offenſiue to the ſenſe of ſmelling.

What though it be vſually taken by fume, and not in ſubſtance, or infuſion? yet that way it worketh the ſame effect in many; and in all it draweth thin and moiſt humours, which all beholders perceiue diſtilling, or rather flowing from the mouth, noſe and eyes of the takers of it. But admit that it doth not purge; Sound bodies need no alteration.which is very euident; yet it altereth the body much: and how can that be done in yoong and ſtrong men without hurt? It conſumeth the moiſture, and increaſeth the heat of perfect conſtitutions, as the fire and Sunne doe ſenſibly heat and drie things expoſed to them. Heat and moiſture, in their iuſt mixture, are the preſeruers of life: if the proportion of heat be increaſed, it conſumeth moiſture the faſter:

               Humiditas caloris pabulum. if moiſture be diminiſhed, there followeth a neceſſary decay of heat: for it is maintained and fed by that, as a lampe with oile: therefore Tabacco, being armed with the exceſſe of both theſe qualities, profeſſed enemies to youth, doth exerciſe cruell tyranny vpon it.

               Galen ſayth; Moiſteſt bodies liue longeſt. To this agreeth that of Ariſtotle; They that inhabit hot countries are of ſhorter life: for the heat of the Sunne draweth out much moiſture from the body, and the continuall drawing in of hot aire by breathing, doth diſſipate and conſume it, and conſequently haſteneth a drie and withered diſtemper, the meſſenger of death approching. Doth not Tabacco then threaten a ſhort life to the great takers of it? The often drawing in of this hot and drie fume, maketh them ſomewhat like thoſe that liue in hot regions: though this be not continuall, as that is, yet 2. de legibus: quia eos ad libidinem & iram praecipites reddat.the heat and drineſſe of this doth farre exceed that. Plato would not allow yoong men to drinke wine, though moderatly, becauſe it carieth them headlong to luſt and anger. Doth not Tabacco this much more? Wine is hot and moiſt: Tabacco exceedeth it farre in heat; for from the exceſſe of that, it hath the ſtrong ſmell and fretting taſte, Siccitas caloris ſtimulus.and it hath drineſſe aſſociated to it in ſtead of the others moiſture. Beſide this, Wine nouriſheth; Tabacco purgeth. So it is euery way farre more hurtfull than Wine. It is in greateſt requeſt amongſt our yoonger and ſtronger ſort of gentlemen; and the quicker ſpirits and Cereus in vitium flecti, monitoribus aſper: ſublimis, &c.hoter complexions are caried moſt violently to the often taking of it, being like to the yoong man that Horace deſcribeth. Euery man, that hath but taſted of Naturall philoſophy, may eaſily comprehend it to be a dangerous and pernitious thing to cholericke conſtitutions: It breedeth many diſeaſes.it inclineth them to burning agues, phrenſies, and hectikes; or carieth them into an vntimely melancholy: for the vnkinde heat of it, exceeding the naturall heat of the bodie, doth waſte and deſtroy that, and ſo breedeth a melancholicke diſtemper by the long continued vſe of it. Choler is like to a coale burning cleere with his full heat, whoſe moiſture as it conſumeth, ſo the heat diminiſheth, and It breedeth melancholy.in time it becommeth blacke, drie and cold: euen ſo the often drinking of this herbe, doth by his vehement heat burne the cholericke bloud, and maketh it groſſe, thicke and blacke.

Galen ſayth, the beſt complexions haue the beſt maners: and he writeth a whole booke to prooue that the affections of the minde follow the temper and conſtitution of the body. What though that be ſpecially vnderſtood of the originall temperature that we haue from our parents; yet as that changeth with our age naturally, or accidentally by Tabacco, or any other outward meanes; ſo there is with that, great change of the affections, and inclinations It hurteth the minde.of the minde. As heat & ſharpneſſe increaſe in the blood, ſo do haſtineſſe and furie in the minde: and when the blood groweth

thicke and groſſe, the minde is dull and ſad. This is too apparent in many, though it be obſcured by diſcretion in ſome. I ſee not therfore how Tabacco can be acquited from procuring the ouerthrow of the perfect ſtate both of body and minde: and that not onlie in It is ill for their iſſue.Tabacconiſts themſelues, but in their poſterity alſo; for the temperament and conſtitution of the father is ordinarily transfuſed into the children, and the affections of the minde alſo, depending vpon the other. This is verified likewiſe in diſtempered and ſicke bodies. Eſt in

               Fernelius ſaith, what diſeaſe ſo euer the father hath, that goeth into the childe. The father giueth the forme, nature and eſſence to the child, as Galen affirmeth. Therefore where the humours of the body haue contracted a ſharpe heat and drineſſe by drinking of Tabacco, there the father getteth a childe like to himſelfe, wanting that kinde moiſture that ſhould protract his life vnto olde age, and incline him to an ingenuous, courteous and kinde carriage. But many take it, imagining that it doth inable them in ſome actions. I confeſſe that it putteth a ſharpe and fretting heat into the blood, which doth incitare: but they ſhall the ſooner faile in their courſe; for heat can not be preſerued without moiſture: and Tabacco conſumeth that, by infuſing a drie qualitie into the body, by exceſſe of heat, and by drawing out of moiſture. Therefore Tabacco; though neuer ſo ſparingly taken, can not be good for you, nor for yoong and ſound bodies: and the often vſe of it in ſuch bodies, driueth them lentis gradibus into their graue long before that time that nature had aſſigned them. It ſhortneth life.
               Hippocrates ſayth, that which is done by little and little, is done ſafely: Quod paulatim fit, tutò fit. Aphor. lib. 2. 4. de cib. boni & mali▪ ſucci. ca. 2.and in diet as well as in other things, he commandeth all to be vſed with moderation. Galen ſpeaking of gentle opening medicines, affirmeth that the often vſe of them drieth vp the ſolid parts of the body, and maketh the blood thicke and groſſe; which being burnt in the kidnies, breedeth the ſtone. This may as well be verified of Tabacco; for many take it oftener than euer ſuch opening medicines were taken: and it hath alſo more heat and drineſſe than thoſe had; and therefore greater power to hurt ſound bodies. There may peraduēture be a profitable vſe of it in cold & moiſt bodies: but it muſt be taken very ſeldome, and with great regard of ſundry other circumſtances. To conclude, ſith it is ſo hurtfull and dangerous to youth, I wiſh (in compaſſion of them) that it might haue the pernitious nature expreſſed in the name, and that it were as well knowen Youths-bane.by the name of Youths-bane, as by the name of Tabacco. 2. Meat and drinke. Lib. 1. de ſanit. tuend.
               
            
            The ſecond thing is meat and drinke. Our bodies, as Galen affirmeth, are in aſſiduo fluore, in a continuall waſting, the inward heat alwayes conſuming part of the very ſubſtance of them. The vſe of meat and drinke is neceſſarie for the reſtauration of this dayly loſſe. Theſe rightly vſed according to the rules of phyſicke, haue great Lib. 1. de morb. cauſes cap. 14. Nulla calamitate, &c.power to preſerue the body from diſeaſes. This is verified by Galen in the ſame booke. To him Fernelius aſſenteth in theſe words; He

ſhall be troubled with no diſeaſe, that layeth temperance for the foundation of his life. And in the ſame chapter he addeth, That neither the aire, nor the affections of the minde, nor any other cauſe, doth breed diſeaſes, vnleſſe there be a diſpoſition in the body proceeding from ſome errour in diet.  There are fiue things to be obſerued in the vſe of meat: The ſubſtance, the quantity, the qualities,  the times of eating, and the order. Touching the ſubſtance, Galen ſayth, De cib. boni & mali ſucci, ca. 4.
               In victu ſalubri, &c. In healthfull diet the two chiefe things are meats of good iuice and not ſtopping. Here, to auoid tediouſneſſe, I paſſe ouer meats of good nouriſhment, moſt of them being well knowen to you, and I will ſpeake only of ſome few that are badde. Meats of ill iuice fill the body with groſſe humours ſubiect to putrifafaction,Initio lib. 1. de ſanit tuenda. & initio lib. de cibis boni & mali ſucci.  which is one of the principall cauſes of moſt diſeaſes. Galen reporteth, that when there was great ſcarſitie of corne thorowout the Romane Empire, the people being compelled to eat roots and hearbs of bad nouriſhment, fell into diſeaſes of ſundry kindes.Initio lib. 5. de ſanit. tuenda. This he doth further confirme by the example of his owne body; for during the time of his eating of ordinary fruits, he was troubled with agues almoſt euery yeere: but after that he left them, and fed only on good meats, he protracted his life vntill extreame olde age without any ſickneſſe.Fleſh. The worſt meats that are in vſe with vs are, of fleſh, Bulles beefe, the blood whereof being accounted poiſon amongſt Phyſicians, may iuſtly make the fleſh ſuſpected, ſpecially for colde and weake ſtomacks. All olde beefe is of hard digeſtion, and breedeth groſſe and melancholike blood. Bores fleſh is much of the ſame nature, and the older and greater, the worſe. There is the like reaſon of Bucks, Male-goats, and Rammes, in their kinde: their ill iuice increaſeth with their yeeres, and thoſe vngelt are of harder and groſſer nouriſhment. Blood.Blood, howſoeuer it be prepared, is vtterly condemned by Galen:
               De aliment. facult. ſo are the inwards of beaſts, and the feet alſo, ſpecially of the greater ſort of them. Fiſh.Of fiſhes the greater and older are the worſt, and bring moſt labour to the ſtomacke: thoſe that liue in muddy or ſtanding waters are farre worſe than thoſe of the ſame kinde that keepe in grauelly or cleere riuers. Ecles are iuſtly excluded from the number of holſome meats, becauſe they breed of putrifaction. Fruits.Moſt Engliſh fruits are forbidden in diet. Many of them are profitable in medicines: De cibis bon. &c. cap. 5.therefore Galen ſayth, Apples, Peares and Medlers are not to be vſed as meats, but as medicines.  Therefore called

               The ſooner ripe and the ſooner ſubiect to corruption, are moſt condemned, becauſe they are eaſily turned into putrifaction in the body. Cucumbers are too vſuall with vs, being vtterly reiected by De aliment. facult.

as Galen affirmeth. De ſimp. medic. facult. lib. 3.It is not ſafe for any man in the vſe of theſe bad meats to preſume vpon his ſtrong ſtomacke; for though naughty meats be well concocted, yet De aliment. facult. li. 2. ca. 6. .
               Galen telleth vs, that when the iuice of them is caried into the veines, it reteineth the old nature. This point is more largely handled by Ludouicus Merca

                  us a learned Italian. De indicat. li. 1. ca. 1. But I conclude with Galen in the foreſayd place; we muſt abſtaine from all meats of bad iuice, though they be eaſie of concoction: Omnibus praui ſucci 
                     •

                The ſecond thing to be conſidered in eating is the quantity:The quantity. this  muſt not be proportioned to the appetite, but to the ſtrength of the ſtomacke to concoct it perfectly: for the fault or defect of the firſt concoction is neuer amended in the ſecond or third: if the liuer receiueth the chylus or iuice of meats raw and inconcocted from the ſtomacke, it conuerteth it into groſſe and impurel bood, and ſo ſendeth it into the leſſer veines, where there is no power to refine it. It were ſuperfluous to ſpeake of defect in this point, for gluttony, that Plures interimit crapula quàm gladius.great murdering tyrant of the world, hath ſubiected moſt of the richer ſort, and lead them by pleaſant variety to the cruell priſon of ſickneſſe, and from thence to mercileſſe execution. 2.

               Fernelius a learned French man maketh gluttony the mother of all diſeaſes, though they haue another father. Of all the fiue things before mentioned, the error in quantity is moſt vſuall, and moſt dangerous, and therefore moſt carefully to be auoided. A full diet ſtuffeth the body with groſſe humours, and with winde; it breedeth obſtructions, after which followeth putrifaction, and agues of ſundry kindes: alſo it begetteth many colde diſeaſes, as gouts, dropſies, palſies, and ſuch like: it oppreſſeth both the outward and inward ſenſes: it ſuffocateth & extinguiſheth the natural heat, as a lampe with too much oile.In Hippoc. aphor. lib. 1. 3. Thus were ſome of the great champions, that vſed to contend at the ſolemne games of Olympus, ſuddenly choked with fulneſſe, as Galen reporteth. Alſo it breedeth thicke & groſſe ſpirits, whereby the wit is made obtuſe and blunt, and the iudgement dull and weake. Finally, it maketh a man vnfit not only for naturall and ciuill actions, but alſo for diuine meditations, according to that of Galen: 
               Animus ſanguine & adipe ſuffocat.The minde choked with blood and fatneſſe, can not meditate of heauenly things. Quin corpus onuſtum beſternis vitijs, &c. ſorm. li. 2 ſat. 2.

Philoſtrat. 9. li. 3.There is a memorable hiſtory of one Apollonius Tyanaeus in the reigne of Domitian, who hauing excellent gifts of nature, and confirming them by dayly hearing, reading and meditating, obteined ſuch deepe and admirable knowledge, that he could tell many ſtrange things, yea and foretell things to come: wherupon he was accuſed before the Emperor to haue conference with diuels: but he cleered himſelfe with this anſwer; That he did alwayes ſeed on light meats in a ſmall quantity, and without variety: This kinde of diet, ſayd he, hath giuen ſuch an excellent perſpicuity to my inward ſenſes, that I doe cleerely ſee, as in a glaſſe, things paſt and to come.

To conclude this point, variety of meats is the greateſt meane to allure the appetite, and conſequently to procure ouerfeeding: therefore all Phyſicians doe inhibit many ſorts of meat to be eaten at one meale; for beſide the hurt of the quantity, the difference of their qualities procureth labour to the ſtomacke, and hindereth perfect concoction.

                  .and incocted iuice, which will fill the body with matter fit for diſeaſes, before there be any ſenſible feeling of it. This is confirmed by 1. Aphoriſ. 14.
               Hippocrates in theſe words: Olde men haue little heat, and therefore ſhould eat little meat; for as an heape of greene wood quencheth a little fire, ſo, much meat extinguiſheth the decayed heat of the ſtomacke. In this reſpect Montanus forbiddeth olde men to go to feaſts, leſt by long ſitting and inticing variety of meats, they ſhould eat much.
            
                
               The qualities of meat.The third thing to be conſidered in meat is the quality: in which it ſhall be ſufficient to obſerue theſe two rules out of Hippocrates: Similiaſimilibus conſeruantur, and contraria contrarijs curantur; an equall and perfect temper of the body is to be preſerued by meats temperate, and without any exceſſe of heat, moiſture, colde, or drineſſe▪ but if this eucraſia or perfect mixture of the elements be decayed, ſo, as ſome of theſe qualities haue obtained dominion, then the body is to be reduced to his former ſtate by contraries; as when it is too

hot, the diet muſt be cooling; and ſo of the reſt. Alſo the diet in Summer muſt be much cooler and moiſter, than in Winter: for in that ſeaſon we draw in by breathing farre hotter aire: the Sunne alſo infuſeth into vs a burning heat, and ſucketh out much of our moiſture. Furthermore, yoong men and olde are to obſerue this difference in reſpect of their yeeres: for that age is like to Summer, and this to Winter.
            
               
               The times. The fourth thing that is to be obſerued in eating, is the times.  New meat may not be put into the ſtomacke before the former be thorowly concocted and digeſted; for ſo ſhould both be corrupted, as Initio lib. de diſſol contin
               Galen affirmeth. I know that De indic. lib. 1. cap.

               Fernelius is freer from danger, where he commendeth faſting as the beſt meanes to concoct crudity:Non ſe, ſed ſuam perniciem alunt. They that are full of ſuperfluous humors, ſayth he, can hardly endure faſting: and yet while they endeuour to repreſſe the violence and fury of the humour by taking meat often, they nouriſh not themſelues, but their owne deſtruction: for all the offence that groweth by faſting, will ſoone be taken away by the continuance of it.The cuſtome of our meales not agreeable to phyſicke. The cuſtome of our nation, for the vſuall times of eating amongſt the better ſort, agreeth not with the rules of Phyſicke: for a large ſupper following ſo ſoone after a full dinner, heapeth vp crudity, fit matter for diſeaſes. Breakfaſt and ſupper without any dinner, would agree farre better with thoſe that haue cold and moiſt bodies, or that vſe little exerciſe, as Lud. Mercat. affirmeth in the foreſayd place. This opinion is confirmed by the cuſtome of the ancients.

It can not be ſtrongly obiected againſt this, that the Grecians at the ſiege of Troy vſed to eat foure times dayly; or three of thoſe meales were only of bread & wine in a ſmall quantity, and their ſupper was far larger of fleſh. It ſeemeth that this often eating was extraordinary, according to their extraordinary labour in the warres: for Galen, 
               De ſanit. tuend. lib. 6.ſpeaking of the cuſtome of the countrey, maketh mention but of a light breakefaſt or dinner, and a larger ſupper. Horat. coena d

naturall heat, in theſe your flouriſhing yeeres, will not permit you any light feeling of this errour in laying one meale vpon another, yet this bad cuſtome layeth a ſecret and hidden foundation for ſickneſſe, whereupon you ſhall dayly build without ſuſpition, vntill it riſeth to the full height of ſome dangerous diſeaſe.

               The order. The fift and laſt thing to be obſerued in diet▪ is the order of taking ſundry meats at one meale.  Gal. in Hippoc. de vict. rat. com. 3. 22.The cuſtome of this land differeth in this alſo from the common receiued opinion amongſt Phyſitians, which is to eat thoſe meats firſt that are lighteſt of concoction, that they may firſt paſſe out of the ſtomacke. But this opinion is reiected in a bookeDe diſſol contin. aſcribed to Galen, and a reaſon annexed to diſproue it: therefore in this doubt, I hold it ſafeſt for you to follow your woonted cuſtome, which, as Hippoc. ſayth,2. Aphor. 50.  is not ſuddenly to be broken, though it be a little woorſe.Cuſtome not ſuddenly to be broken. Two diſhes at one meale. The ſafeſt way to preuent all danger of diſorder is, neuer to eat of aboue two diſhes at one meale; which is an excellent meane to preſerue health. What though Epicures obiect, Qui medicè viuit, miſerè viuit? yet you ſhall thereby be happie in the fruition of your health, when they ſhall be wretched and miſerable by the grieuances that follow the full pleaſure and delight of the taſte.
            
               Of drinke. Touching drinke, there are three vſuall kinds of it with vs, as euery man knoweth, Wine, Ale, and Beare. Wine.Wine is firſt both in time and excellency: thoſe which be ſweet, are hot & moiſt: that which is white, ſharpe and new, hath manifeſt power of cooling, as Galen affirmeth. De cib. bon. ca. 8.The older that wines are, the hoter they are. The benefit of wine is ſet forth by Galen:
               Lib. an animi mores, &c. it doth greatly helpe concoction, digeſtion, breeding of good bloud and nouriſhment. But this is to be vnderſtood with diſtinction of wines, of complexions, and of yeres:Lib de cib. bon. cap. 8. for new wines haue in them a groſſe and earthly ſubſtance, by reaſon whereof they are ſo farre from helping the concoction of meats, that they themſelues are hardly concocted, as he ſayth in another place. And hot wines are vtter enemies to all infirmities of the head. They are alſo very hurtfull to hot complexions; therefore they are generally forbidden to youth and flouriſhing yeeres: as is plaine in ſundry places inDe ſanit. tuend.

               Galen. Ale is cooler than Beere, becauſe it wanteth the hop; it fumeth not vp to the head, as wine and beere doe: therefore it is moſt healthfull in infirmities of the head; but it is windy. Hoppes, which make the difference betwixt ale and beere, are hot and drie; therefore beere is farre hoter than ale, if they be equall in other things: it is alſo much more opening. The vſe of drinke is to reſtore the

moiſture which the heat of the body dayly conſumeth, as Li. 1. de ſanit. tuenda.
               Galen ſayth. In Hip. de vict. ratione lib. 3.It is alſo cibi vehiculum: it maketh the chylus or iuyce of the meat more liquid or thinne, that it may be the caſier carried into the veines, and diſtributed into all parts of the body. Labor, cibus, potus, ſomnus, venus.
               Hippoc. ſayth, exerciſe, meat, drinke, &c. and all in a meane. Heere is a plaine and manifeſt rule for the moderate vſe of this: that it be neuer taken in great quantity. The words alſo conteine a more obſcure rule for the time of drinking: that is, meales muſt begin with meat, and then drinke to follow: for ſo Galen expoundeth that place, that the order of the words is to be obſerued, and the things performed accordingly: firſt labour, then meat, after that drinke. Not to drink betweene meales. Sacke before ſupper not allowed.This condemneth the common cuſtome of drinking betwixt meales or immediatly before them. Sacke before ſupper is as hurtfull, as vſuall, it carrieth the vnconcocted relikes of the meat into the veines before the due time: alſo it procureth a falſe appetite, whereby new meat is taken before the former be digeſted; which is a peſtilent enemy to health. The quantity of drinke muſt be proportioned to the meat, with a regard of the temperature of the body, and ſeaſon of the yeere: for leane and drie bodies are allowed more than fat and moiſt; and a greater quantity in Summer than in Winter. Very little drinke hindereth concoction in ſome ſtomacks, and diſtribution in moſt. The hurt of much drinke.A great quantity oppreſſeth the ſtomacke, hindereth concoction, breedeth winde, offendeth the head, and filleth the whole body with ſuperfluous moiſture. Drinke betwixt meales.Drinke may ſometimes be allowed betwixt meales to cholericke bodies, after the meat is concocted in the ſtomacke, as De indic. lib. 1. cap. 2 conſil. li 1.
               Ludouic. Mercat. affirmeth▪ Alſo Epiſt.
               Crato, a learned Germane, counſelleth him that hath a hot liuer, to drinke after the firſt concoction. In Hipp. aphor. lib. 5. 27.
               Galen alloweth drinke in the night, but to thoſe only that are extreamely thirſty: but this liberty of drinking betwixt meales procureth much hurt to flegmaticke bodies, and to thoſe that drinke for pleaſure or cuſtome without great thirſt. Hippoc. forbiddeth drinke to them that are ready to go to bed, becauſe ſleepe moiſteneth ſufficiently.
            
               
                Exerciſe. The third thing to be conſidered for the preſeruation of health is exerciſe and reſt. Exerciſe is defined to be a vehement motion of the body, whereby breathing is altered, or wearineſſe procured. De ſanit. tuend▪ lib. 2.
               
               Galen ſayth, That all motion of the body is not to be accounted exerciſe, but only that which is violent, euen to the drawing of breath ſhorter. Exerciſe is not ſafe in all bodies; for if there be plethora, or cacochymia, fulneſſe of blood in the veines, or of ſome bad humors in the whole body; Gal. de ſanit. li. 4. arthrit. ſciatica, gon
                     •
                  gra, &c.there it may driue the ſuperfluous matter into ſome principall part, and ſo breed dangerous diſeaſes: or into the ioynts, and procure extreame paines. Therefore in this caſe the ſafeſt way is, firſt to take away this fulneſſe by opening a veine, or by purging, or by a ſlender diet, and then to begin with gentle and moderate exerciſe, increaſing it dayly by ſmall degrees: for all ſudden changes

are dangerous, as Hippocrates affirmeth. The fitteſt time for exerciſe, is the morning vpon an empty ſtomacke, when the ſupper is perfectly concocted, and fully digeſted:Celſus. for if any man feeleth any relikes of his ſupper after he ariſeth in the morning, it is farre ſafer for him to follow the counſell of Celſus, and betake himſelfe to ſleepe againe, than by exerciſe to ſend raw Gal. de ſanit. tuend. lib. 4.humours into the habit of the body. Much more is that exerciſe to be condemned that is vſed ſoone after meat. De cib. bon. &c.
               Galen ſayth, he that auoideth crudity, and doth not exerciſe himſelfe after meat, ſhall neuer be ſicke: and when exerciſe is omitted before meat, De diſſol. contin.he teacheth a remedy for that, parcius cibandum, the meale muſt be th e lighter. De d

                  .
               Hippoc. ſetteth forth the commendation of exerciſe moderatly vſed, and at fit times, in theſe few words; Corpus robuſtum reddit, It maketh the body ſtrong. And in De morb. popul. lib. 6.another place he ſayth; Labour is to the ioynts and fleſh, as meat and ſleepe to the inward parts. In Timaeo: exercitium roborat, &c. 
               Plato ſheweth the benefit of exerciſe, and the hurt of much reſt: Exerciſe ſtrengtheneth, Reſt breedeth rottenneſſe in the body. Ouid.To theſe accordeth that of the Poet; Cernis vt ignauum corrumpant otia corpus: vt capiant vitium, ni mo

Mercat. in commending exerciſe, ſayth it helpeth three wayes: Firſt, it increaſeth the naturall heat, whereby commeth perfect concoction, and plentifull nouriſhment: Secondly, the ſpirits thereby are caried with greater force, which cleanſeth the paſſages of the body, and expelleth the ſuperfluous excrements better: Out of theſe two riſeth a third commodity, that the inſtrumentall parts of the body doe by this motion gather hardneſſe and ſtrength, and are more inabled to reſiſt the diſeaſes incident vnto them.
            
               
               Sleepe. 2.  
               Lib. aph. 3. 7.The fourth thing to be obſerued for continuance of health, is ſleeping and waking. Lib. aph. 68.Of this is that aphoriſme of Hippoc. Sleeping, or waking, exceeding meaſure, are both ill. This he further confirmeth in another place: Too little ſleepe hindereth concoction, and too much is an enemy to diſtribution it hindereth the carriage of the chylus or iuyce of the meat into the veines: by this groſſe humors are ingendred, the body made heauy and lumpiſh, and the wit dull. The Hipp. & Gal. in Hipp. de morb. vulg. lib. 3. 6.night is much fitter for ſleepe than the day, becauſe the ſpirits moue inward by reaſon of the darke. I will not trouble you with the Cardan. in Hipp. Andr. Laurent.diſſenting opinions of our authours about the maner of lying in ſleepe: it ſhall be ſufficient to note that it is not good to lie all night vpon one ſide; and that the worſt maner oflying is vpon the backe. The length of time allowed for ſleepe is ſeuen or eight houres: longer ſleepe is required after a large ſupper than after a light. De ſanit. tuend. lib. 6.
               Galen ſeemeth to allow nine houres for ſleepe, which In Hipp. prognoſt. 11. 12.
               Cardan, a great patron of long ſleepe, taketh holde of. Sleepe moiſteneth the body, therefore larger ſleepe is permitted to drier bodies. The olde rule of riſing Gal. ſ

there is ſome infirmity of the head. Sleepe is not allowed vntil three or foure houres after ſupper: for vpon a ful ſtomacke a whole cloud of fumes & vapors aſcend to the head in ſleepe, a great part wherof is diſperſed in waking. Sleepe after dinner ill.This reaſon doth inhibit ſleepe after dinner, as an vtter enemy to the head: but when the ſtomacke is weake and the head ſtrong, a ſhort nap ſitting is allowed, becauſe it helpeth concoction, by drawing the heat inward.
            
               
               Retention and expulſion. The fift thing for continuance of health, is retention and expulſion of ſuperfluous excrements at fit times. Euery concoction hath it ſeuerall ſuperfluity: if any of theſe be reteined or kept too long in the body, or expelled too ſoone, or with great violence; health is thereby impaired: if the bowels empty not themſelues at fit times, the neighbour parts ſuffer offence thereby, and the head alſo receiueth vnkinde fumes: if the liuer and ſpleene want their timely vnloadings into the kidnies and bowels, diſeaſes of ſundry ſorts follow after if the kidnies and bladder holde their vnprofitable burdens beyond their iuſt times, they are weakened by that heauy weight, by extending the parts, and by increaſing of heat: if ſweat or inſenſible tranſpiration be hindered, obſtructions and putrefact

               on ſucceed, and after them, agues of ſundry kinds: if any of there or any other humour ruſh out of the body with great force, or iſſue quietly in too great quantity, the naturall heat and ſpirits paſſe out with them, whereby the whole body is weakened. Herodotus.There was a cuſtome amongſt the Egyptians, to empty their bodies with medicines three dayes together in euery moneth, that no ſuperfluous humour might hold long poſſeſſion there. By this it appeareth what great danger they eſteemed it to nouriſh their enemies within the walles of their city. But this courſe can not be iuſtified by the rules of phyſicke: it agreeth farre better with health to preuent this fulneſſe by a ſlender diet, and moderate exerciſe. The errours committed in theſe two, are commonly the cauſe of the exceſſe and defect in this point.

               Plato held opinion, that all the diſeaſes of the body haue their beginning from the minde. Moderate ioy and mirth do both preſerue health and driue away ſickneſſe: the ſpirits are thereby ſtirred vp, heat is increaſed, and the humours are extenuated and clarified. Quintus Fabius, that renowmed Romane captaine, being twelue yeeres afflicted with a quartane ague, was freed from it by the ioy of a victory obteined againſt Hannibal. 
               Chaucer.An ancient Engliſh poet ſingeth thus: As long liues neuer thee, as euer thee, and a yere the longer for his meritee. But this affection how profitable ſoeuer it be, ifit exceedeth the limits & bounds of moderation, it is ſometimes deadly: therefore Fernel. ſayth,Inſtar ſubuinis ſpiritus diſſipa. it diſperſeth the ſpirits like lightning, that they can not returne to mainteine life.

Hiſtories affoord many examples of thoſe that haue beene brought into conſumptions, and to death, by ſorrow and griefe. Feare.Feare is an expectation of ill; it is commonly the forerunner of griefe; it calleth the bloud ſuddenly from the outward parts to the heart, and leaueth them deſtitute of their naturall heat; for want whereof they tremble and ſhake: the heart then ſuffereth violence alſo, as appeareth by the weake and ſlow pulſe: and it is ſometimes ſuddenly ouercome and ſuffocated by the violent recourſe of bloud. Feare killeth many.Thus Publius Rutilius and Marcus Lepidus ended their liues, as Pliny reporteth. There are ſundry examples in hiſtories of thoſe that through extreame feare haue had their haire changed into a whitiſh hoareneſſe in one night.Skenk. obſeruat.

I know that ſome Cardan. conſil. 1.are of contrary opinion: but I may not enter into controuerſies, hauing beene already ſo long. Other affections I omit, as being neere the nature of ſome of theſe, and hauing leſſe power to hurt the body. You ſee ſir with what efficacy the affections of the minde worke into the body: therefore it is as neceſſary for health to holde a meane and moderation in them, as in the fiue other forenamed things. For though we liue in a ſweet and pure aire, obſerue a ſtrict diet, vſe ſleepe and exerciſe according to the rules of Phyſicke, and keepe fit times and meaſure in expelling ſuperfluities out of our bodies; yet if we haue not quiet, calme and placable mindes, we ſhall ſubiect ourſelues to

thoſe diſeaſes that the minde, yeelding to theſe paſſions, commonly inflicteth vpon the body: theſe are many in number, grieuous to ſuffer, and dangerous to life.
            Thus I haue briefly run ouer theſe ſix things, which being rightly vſed with ſpeciall care and regard, will preſerue all ſtrong bodies in continuall health, and preuent all diſeaſes vntill the radicall moiſture be conſumed, and no oile left to maintaine the light of the lampe.
         
         
            A Diſcourſe of Empiricks, or vnlearned Phyſicians.
            
               A Preface to the Reader.
               
                  THe life of man is ſo precious, as that all which a man hath he will giue for the ranſome thereof. Neither is this care of preſeruing his owne life alone, naturally implanted in the heart of man; but that he may ſaue the life of others alſo, how dangerouſly will he aduenture! ſomtimes caſting himſelfe into deepe waters to ſaue one from danger of drowning; ſometimes breaking into an houſe flaming on euery ſide, to deliuer one from periſhing in the fire. And this naturall inſtinct hath beene the cauſe alſo, that publike perſons haue by holeſome lawes prouided for the ſafety thereof, and priuate men haue ſpent their thoughts in diſcouering thoſe ſtratagems whereby the life of man is oppugned. Now becauſe none are more pernicious enemies to the ſame than are theſe Empericks (who vnder colour of drawing out

the threed of mans life, doe moſt cruelly cut the ſame in ſunder before the time) there haue beene ſome in all ages, that haue vehemently inueighed

                     •
                  uous fire. But hitherto all labour hath beene loſt, that was ſpent that way: for (like the Lernean monſter againſt which Hercules fought) in the roome of one, ſeuen others haue ariſen, and haue by oppoſition growen, both in number and eſtimation alſo with many: and that partly by their owne diuelliſh and deteſtable practiſes, and partly by the folly of others. And firſt for themſelues, they will falſly vaunt what admirable cures haue beene performed by them: that No mottall man is able to doe more than they can doe. They will promiſe confidently to cure any diſeaſe though neuer ſo deſperate; as, to breake a confirmed ſtone in the bladder, or els To lodge it in ſome part of the bladder, that it ſhall neuer paine them after. And vnto ſuch as are therefore left by the iudicious Phyſician, becauſe ſentence of death hath already paſſed againſt them on an That is, a day that ſheweth what ſhall happen on the Indicatory day, or day of iudgemēt, as the 4, 11, 17 dayes, declare the iſſue of the ſickneſſe the 7▪ 14, & 20 dayes.Indicatory day, they will warrant life, and that to the end they may be imployed after their betters, which is no ſmall credit vnto them. Now if they be found to haue miſſed the cuſhion, and the party dies (as was foretold) then will they pawne their liues that the diſeaſe was miſtaken by the firſt Phyſitian, and that if they had beene called to the cure but one day ſooner, it had beene a matter of nothing to haue ſaued his life, for the partie died becauſe he was let bloud (if that were aduiſed by the other with good diſcretion) or becauſe he was not let blood (if that were omitted vpon iuſt cauſe.) On the contrary, the learned Phyſitian (though he haue no religion) will not, for his credit ſake, be found to vtter any vntrueth; is very ſparing in reporting his owne cures, thinking it a part of high wiſdome, that another ſhould praiſe him, and not his owne lips: and knowing how coniecturall in his Art many things are, dares not promiſe more than he can iuſtifie by Art, leſt he make himſelfe ridiculous: and not being ignorant of the deſperate condition of ſome, and how incurable many diſeaſes are, doth freely and ingenuouſly profeſſe (though he be many times diſmiſſed for his labour) that they admit of no perfect cure, and will not feed

men with a falſe hope, that he may be fed by their purſes: nor will ſeeke his owne praiſe by vniuſt cenſuring of others. Neither is the number of Empericks thus onely increaſed by theſe their cunning ſleights and crafty couſenages, but alſo by the childiſh dealing of thoſe that imploy them. For (as a learned D

The chiefest cauſe why they be thus addicted vnto them, and magnifie them aboue the learned Phyſician, is partly becauſe they can imploy them for a leſſe reward (wherein notwithſtanding they are often times deceiued) and partly becauſe they will ſupply the place of a foole to make ſport with, aſwell as of a phyſitian to cure their infirmities. Therefore are they called in the beginning to the cure of ordinary ſickneſſes wherein is no danger at all; whereas the other is then ſent for, whenas either by medicines, not fitting the diſeaſe, the ſicke perſon is brought to the pits brinke, or at the leaſt by trifling away the opportunity of time with medicines that doe no good, the diſeaſe becommeth incurable. Heere if the ſicke perſon dies, all the fault will be layed by thoſe that fauour theſe Empericks vpon the laſt Phyſitian, that they cannot ſee but that moe die vnder the hand of the learned Phyſitian than vnder others, that they haue no good lucke, becauſe they often times die to whom they come. By theſe and the like ſpeeches, ſicke perſons are diſcouraged from ſending for any other Phyſitian than him whom they firſt imployed for feare they ſhould die. But it were wel if theſe ſilly perſons knew how dangerous a thing in ſickneſſe a little delay is: for then would they conſult with the moſt able Phyſitian in the beginning of any infirmity how ſlight ſoeuer it ſeemed to be. For it is not ſo in this buſineſſe as in matters of law, where if any error be committed in the firſt proceeding by

the ignorance or inſufficiency of him that was imployed, it may be reuerſed or (to vſe their owne terme) trauerſed, and come to a new triall, by which it will plainly appeare what difference there is betweene the learned and ignorant lawyer: But in this matter of greater importance where the life is in queſtion, the opportunity of time that is let ſlip can not be recalled, and therefore though the learned Phyſitian knoweth what things ſhould fitly haue beene vſed at the firſt, yet when he is called to the cure, there is no place for him, becauſe remedies are good in their ſeaſon only, and then are they Gods hands: but when the opportunity of vſing them is paſt, then either they are nothing or hurtfull. And here kinde neighbours alſo, eſpecially thoſe of the better ſort, come now to be cenſured as faulty; who viſiting a ſicke perſon perſuade him to ſuch a courſe, or ſuch a medicine, as formerly they haue had experience to haue done good to others in the like caſe. Here if they miſtake the diſeaſe or the nature of it, who conceiueth not what hurt may enſue, though altogether againſt their wils? But admit the thing preſcribed be not hurtfull, yet whileſt the remedy is vſed, the ſeaſonable time ſlippeth away, and the diſeaſe groweth deſperate: and thus by their vnſeaſonable good will they hurt them more than if they hated them. Notwithſtanding, becauſe that which they do, is in vnfained deſire of their welfare, & of a compaſſionate affection they haue of the diſtreſſed eſtate of their neighbor; they are rather friendly to be admoniſhed that hereafter they deſiſt and aduiſe nothing without the direction of a Profeſſor of that Art, than to be ſharply reprehended. As for the Empericks (amongst whom alſo you may recken our common Apothecaries) becauſe they haue not ſo much humanity in them as to mourne in the miſeries of others; but all that they hunt after is how they may inrich themſelues, though it be with the loſſe, not of the goods alone, but of the liues of men alſo, they muſt be proceeded againſt with all rigour and extremity, as we do with members that haue the Gangrene and are now come to perfect mortification, wherunto we apply nothing either to clenſe or comfort the part, but cut it off that it corrupt not other ſound parts. But this is the magiſtrates duty, and muſt be left vnto him. That which is to be done by priuate perſons, that is, to inform

the magiſtrate of things amiſſe, that he may redreſſe them; and to giue a caueat to ſuch as will be warned, is performed by a learned man in this Treatiſe; wherein ſuch multiplicity of reading is ioyned with plainneſſe and perſpicuity, that ſuch as be learned may finde that which will thorowly ſatisfie them, and the ſimpler ſort ſhall haue no cauſe to complaine of the obſcuritie thereof, to whoſe vnderſtanding alſo he laboured to frame this booke. If any ſhall reade it without preiudice, he ſhall be conſtramed to confeſſe that the world is much abuſed by this kind of (rauenous birds ſhall I call them which pray only vpon dead carcaſes? nay, of) ſauadge and cruell beaſts, which feed vpon liuing men, and make many carcaſes for the wormes before the time; vnleſſe (peraduenture) they ſo torture them before, as that there is no fleſh to be found on them, but only the skin to couer the bones. Much bound vnto him therefore is this age, and the ages ſucceeding for this his learned paines, if men will not wilfully run the brittle barke of their life vpon the rocks and ſands, diſcouered by him as by a skilfull pilot. Let him therefore be of high account with thee (good Reader) not onely becauſe he is learned, but alſo for that he hath ſo well deſerued of humane ſocietie, aduertiſing all men of great danger which they may preuent, deſcrying and vncaſing theſe masked enemies of mankind, that hereafter, not the aſſes eares will be ſeene thorow the lions skinne, but they will appeare to all that will not wilfully ſhut their eyes to be ſuch as they are indeed. Incourage him by thine acceptance of the firſt fruits of his endeuors, and &;so mayſt thou reape greater fruit of his labours in time to come. Farewell.

I am further encouraged vnto this, firſt, by the nature of the accuſation, that ſtandeth vpon a manifeſt and infallible truth: next, by the hamous facts of the accuſed, which tend not to the loſſe of credit or goods, but of the pretious life of man: in regard whereof I might rather to be iudged, as carried with a deſire of the publike good, than with an humot of any piruate or perſonall reſpect.

                      What an Empirike is. The name of an Empirike is deriued frō the Greeke word which ſignifieth experience: and by an Empirike is, as you know, vnderſtood a Practitioner in Phyſicke, that hath no knowledge in Philoſophy,

Logicke, or Grammar: but fetcheth all his skill from bare and naked experience. Ignorance then is the difference whereby theſe men are diſtinguiſhed from other Phyſitians. But becauſe ignorance is ſometime clothed with the outward garments of knowledge, and men are commonly iudged of by that which is moſt apparent, The outward marks of an Empirike.I will ſet downe ſome outward marks, whereby they may eaſily be diſcerned.

The fourth, the magnifying of their owne sk ll, the extolling their  practiſe, and amplifying their ſtrange and admirable cures. Theſe I only mention, hauing a fitter place to ſpeake more largely of them. I am not ignorant that there was a ſect of Phyſicians amongſt the ancients called Empirici: Rome was full of theſe when Galen came thither: they had more than a ſuperficiall knowledge in the ground of Gal. in H

This is confirmed by Galen, with ſome difference of words, but they agree in ſubſtance; He that will attaine to the knowledge of Phyſicke, muſt firſt be apt and fit for it by nature; then he is to apply his minde to ſtudy in his youth; and of continue with labour and diligence: this is to be done in a fit place, that is, in ſchooles of learning; there he muſt heare the beſt learned men, and reade the moſt approued authours; there he muſt learne the method of the Art, and then he ſhalbe fit to begin to practiſe. De pulſibus. totam vitam ad pulſus cognitionem requiri. The neceſſity of this timely beginning, of hearing many learned maſters, and of long perſeuerance in diligent ſtudy, is prooued by that which Galen ſpeaketh of one particular thing in Phyſicke,Empiriks condemned by Hip. and Gal. The whole life is required to the perfect knowledge of the pulſe. What can be here ſaid in defence of Empiriks? Hippocrates and Galen, the moſt competent iudges of all matters belonging to our Arte, require many things in all the profeſſors of it, two whereof are not to be found in the beſt of them: for whoſoeuer examineth their education, ſhall finde that they neuer applied their youth to ſtudie; neuer had learned man to inſtruct them; neuer vnderſtood method or order of ſtudy, and therefore can follow none in their practiſe: for want whereof all they do is confuſed, diſordered and dangerous. Phyſicke is a profound ſtudy.The ancients did ſignifie the difficulty of this Arte, by placing a cragged or knotty ſtaffe by the picture of Aeſculapius; meaning thereby that it was a deepe, intricate, and profound ſtudy, full of knots and doubts, which can not be explaned or diſſolued, but by ſuch as haue long laboured in the diligent ſearch of the ſecrets thereof. Idem deus ſupientiae & medicinae.
                  Apollo was accounted amongſt the heathen to be the god of Phyſicke, and to haue reuealed it vnto Aeſculapius his ſonne: Medici dcorum filij.ſo there is the ſame god of Wiſdome and of phyſicke: and learned Phyſicians were called by the ancients, The ſonnes of the gods. But Empiriks whoſe yoong yeeres were neuer bleſſed with the knowledge of inferior Arts, cannot in their riper age attaine to any meane knowledge in this diuine profeſſion.

The ſecond ſearcheth out diſeaſes  with their cauſes and ſignes.  The third expreſſeth and explaneth  the ſignes whereby the courſes and times of diſeaſes, and conſequently of life and death, are prognoſticated and foreknowen.  The fourth preſerueth health and preuenteth diſeaſes.  The laſt teacheth  the meanes to take away diſeaſes, and to reſtore the body to perfect health.

Of the fiue foreſayd parts of Phyſicke Empiriks haue little to do with foure; for vnder theſe the theory and ſpeculation of our Arte is compriſed, and that is farre aboue their capacity: therefore they exerciſe themſelues in the laſt, wh ch comprehendeth the practiſe only. This reaſon is ſufficient alone to bring all their practiſe into contempt with all men that haue any taſte of learning: for if of fiue parts neceſſary for euery Phyſician to know, they be vtterly ignorant of foure, and haue but a ſlender and ſuperficiall skill in the fift; if they ruſh into the practiſe of an Arte,Empir. ignorant of foure parts of Phyſicke. hauing neuer learned the theory, which is in all learning accounted neceſſary to be knowen before the practiſe can happily be attempted, they ſhall be driuen into infinite errours, and precipitate

                     •
                  l them: the knowledge of these is as neceſſary to direct a Phyſician in the cure of diſeaſes, as the Pilots Card in ſailing. They are as guides and conducters to leade vs into the vnderſtanding of all things that may helpe or hurt our patients. Omiſſa vnt, curs. tio ſaepè claisdicat. prax. lib. 3.The conſideration of euery one of theſe is ſo neceſſary, that the omitting of one doth oft times marre the cure, as Heurmus affirmeth. Empiriks can not attaine to the knowledge of theſe, though they had the experience of Neſtors yeeres. If it pleaſe you to heare ſome few of the obſeruations, that the methodicall cure of one diſeaſe requireth, you may thereby coniecture the difficulty of the healing of that  and others. Of a pleuriſie.I take for example a Pleuriſie; wherein I omit as impertinent to this place,Empiriks commonly miſtake diſeaſes. the vſuall errour of Empiriks in taking other diſeaſes for this, and the danger of the ſicke by the courſe of Phyſicke built vpon a falſe foundation. Firſt the learned Phyſician is to ſearch out the proper ſignes of this diſeaſe, and by them to diſtinguiſh it from others that haue ſome affinity with it: then he looketh into the cauſe of it, into the differences, and into the ſymptomes or accidents that attend vpon it: he examineth the naturall conſtitution of the patient, his preſent ſtate of body his former courſe of life, his age, his ſtrength, the time of the diſeaſe, the ſeaſon of the yeere, &c. he conſidereth the qualities and quantity of the humors; from whence the matter of the diſeaſe floweth; whether from the whole body, or from one part; by what paſſages it mooueth; whether ſwiftly, or ſlowly; whether vehement paine draweth it, or the ſharpneſſe or plenty of the humor ſtirreth vp or prouoketh the motion. Out of an aduiſed conſideration of all theſe, firſt a diet is to be appointed: this can not be the ſame in euery one that laboureth of this ſickneſſe, but it requireth great variety and alteration agreeable to the foreſaid circumſtances. Then followeth the conſultation of the meanes of the cure: Donat. Alsom. de pleuris.what kinde of euacuation is fitteſt; whether opening a veine, or purging, or both, or neither: for ſometimes the matter of the diſeaſe is diſcuſſed by outward medicines, and requireth neither of theſe two helps. Sometimes there is a fit vſe of fomentations, and  after them, of bleeding, as Hippoc. did,De morb. vulg. lib. 3. in hiſtoriae Anaxionis.  when the diſeaſe could not be mitigated by theſe outward meanes, he opened a veine the eighth day. Prax. li. 3. ca. 9.In many other caſes it is neceſſary to take away a great quantity of bloud in the beginning: therefore Heurnius ſayth, Blood can not be taken away too ſoone, nor in too great a quantity, if the patient be ſtrong: but in weakneſſe it muſt be done often & by ſmall quantities. In ſome bodies Arte forbiddeth taking away of any bloud,

In the vſe of theſe, and alſo of all the former things, the Empirike is plunged into many doubts, and the patient into as many dangers: if he take away too little blood, he taketh not away the diſeaſe; if too much, he taketh away life: if he purgeth when he ſhould open a veine, or doth this when that is required, he committeth a pernicious errour: if he iudgeth not rightly of the humor abounding, of the complexion &c. (of which only Arte is the competent iudge) he can attempt nothing in the cure ſafely, nor ſo much as appoint a fit diet. If he preſcribeth locall or outward medicines of too hot operation, the heart is thereby inflamed the ague exaſperated, and life indangered. If there be in them any defect of heat, the matter of the diſeaſe is bound faſter into the ſide and cheſt with as great perill. If inward medicines be not proportioned to euery vnnaturall affect in the body, and to euery offenſiue quality, as now heating, then cooling; now moiſtening, then drying: ſometimes extenuating or making the humor thinne, ſometimes incraſſating or making it thicke; ſometimes opening, ſomtimes ſtopping, &c. the patient doth neuer receiue any good, but commonly much hurt by them. Argent. conſult.Neither is the Pleuriſie only to be reſpected, but there muſt be a vigilant eye vpon the Ague alſo, which alwayes accompanieth the other, and may kill the patient as well as the Pleuriſie. Moreouer there may be great malignity in the humor, as Geſner reporteth in an epidemiall Pleuriſie all died in whom a veine was opened,Epist. and all liued that receiued cordials. In the great variety of theſe doubts, difficulties and diſtinctions there is a neceſſary vſe of ſound iudgement, confirmed by long ſtudy and profound knowledge both in Philoſophy and Phyſicke. It is therefore cleere that the practiſe of Empiriks, being deſtitute of theſe helps, muſt needs be vnfit and full of perill. It may well be compared to his, that Foreſtus mentioneth,
                     Ʋromant. lib. 3. cap. 1. who wrot out ſundry receits ouer night, and put them confuſedly into a bagge: in the morning when patients came to him, after he had looked on the vrine, he put his hand into the bagge (ſaying to the party, Pray that you may haue a happy lot) Precare vt ſorti

                  2. The errours of Empiriks. But I proceed to lay open ſome few of their groſſe and palpable errors in their practiſe, for to ſpeake of all requireth a whole volume. I will begin with their miſtaking of diſeaſes, a common errour with them, & exceeding dangerous to their patients. Diſeaſes are knowen

                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and diſtinguiſhed by their ſignes. The knowledge of this is comprehended vnder the ſecond part of Phyſicke before mentioned, whereof, becauſe they are ignorant, they muſt needs fall often into this fault. This is ſeldome diſcouered but when rationall Phyſicians haue opportunity to looke into their practiſe; then they ſee the diſeaſe taken to be in the liuer, when it is in the lungs or kidneis; to be in the heart, when it is in the head or mouth of the ſtomacke; to be in the breſt, when it is winde in the ſtomacke extending that region: and many ſuch. What though they can iudge of the gout, the palſie, and the dropſie? ſo can ſimple women doe: but to iudge rightly of the cauſes and differences of theſe diſeaſes, of the manifold differences of Agues, of ſimple and compound ſickneſſes, and of ſundry diſeaſes of the head; that requireth Arte, which is not in any Empirike.Lib. de aere aquis, &c. 
                  Hippoc.  ſheweth the miſery that fel vpon many of the Scythians by miſtaking their diſeaſe and the cauſes of it,The danger of miſtaking diſeaſes. and thereupon by taking a wrong courſe in the cure; of ſtrong and able men, they became as effeminate as weake women, and ſpent all the remainder of their wretched life in the offices of that ſex. In Hippoc. prognost. pag. 181,
                  Heurnius reporteth that an vnlearned Phyſician by miſtaking the cauſe of the diſeaſe, put his patient into a bath, wherein he died preſently; and the Empirike was iuſtly accuſed for killing of him.De calc ren. 
                  Guanerius ſetteth forth the deadly error of another in the cure of a ſicke man, who after extreme & intolerable paines, ended his life. A learned Phyſician hauing a melancholike patient depriued of the right vſe of his inward ſenſes, amongſt other things in the cure, appointed his head to be ſhauen, and then to be anointed and bathed according to arte: Senſeleſſe. imitation.an Empirike hearing of this cure, gat the receit of the outward medicines vſed in it; and not long after, lighting vpon one ſicke of a phrenſic or inflammation of the braine, thought it to be the ſame diſeaſe with the former, becauſe both the patients were madde: therefore he followed the ſteps of the other, with great confidence of the cure: this grieuous error in miſtaking both the diſeaſe and the cauſe of it, brought the miſerable man to a ſpeedy and of his life, farre more cruell to himſelfe, and more terrible to the beholders than the ſickneſſe could haue done. The reaſon of this is plaine and euident to euery meane Phyſician. The cauſe of rauing in the former, was a cold humor; in the latter, a hot: therefore hot medicines, which were fit to cure the one, were as fit to kill the other. But admit the Empirike had beene called to the cure of the ſame diſeaſe, proceeding from the ſame cauſe, yet he could not haue obſerued the circumſtances which arte required, and therefore his receit was vaine and vnprofitable. If the courſe of theſe blinde practiſioners could be obſerued, it would be found to be like to this in euery diſeaſe. Our books are full of ſuch wofull examples. A huge volume will not conteine all the tragicall hiſtories of the ſicke of this age, manifeſtly killed by the ignorance of Empiriks, being not able to diſcerne one diſeaſe from another, or to diſtinguiſh

of their cauſes, or to proceed orderly in the cure. The eye can not diſcerne colours but by the light▪ nor Phyſitians diſeaſes but by learning. In the night not only indiui lua, but ſpecies are miſtaken; as a man for a beaſt, or a tree for either of them. It is alw

                  es night with Empiriks: ignorance is darkneſſe, and knowledge is as the cleere light of the ſun. And doubtleſſe the learned Phyſitian hath as great aduantage ouer Empiriks in diſcerning of diſeaſes, as they that iudge of the eyes obiect by the ſunne, ouer thoſe that iudge of it by the ſtarres. They do the oftener fall into this errour, becauſe ſome diſeaſes agree in two or three ſignes, and yet are farre different. The perfect examining and comparing of ſignes, and referring of them to their ſeuerall cauſes, can not be performed without Arte. But ſuppoſe they could diſtinguiſh of moſt diſeaſes, whereof they come farre ſhort; yet to know the diſeaſe is not one ſtep to the cure, vnleſſe the method and maner of proceeding in it, be as well knowen. But to proceed in diſcouering their errours: the two moſt effectuall and vſuall meanes for the cure of moſt diſeaſes, are opening a veine and purging. The ſpeciall obſeruations that are required in both theſe, are farre aboue the apprehenſion of vnlearned Empiriks; therefore they can not vndertake any thing fitly and ſafely in either of them. Of opening a veine.What a great regard is to be had in preſeruing bloud in his naturall quantity and qualities, is euident in that it giueth nouriſhment and ſtrength to the whole body: and it is as it were the meat whereby the natiue heat is fed, as Galen ſayth:Pabulum natiui caloris. de natur. facult. lib. 2.  therefore it may not  be drawen out of the body without mature deliberation. Gal. de ſang miſs. cap. 6.The things that are to be obſerued in opening a veine, are reduced vnto ten heads: theſe I muſt not mention, becauſe I labour to be ſhort. Many of theſe conteine ſuch doubts and difficulties, as require much reading and deepe knowledge. Empiriks alwayes take away blood without due examination of theſe, (for how can they examine thoſe that they know not?) therefore oft times they take away life alſo. Experientia ſt

                     torum magiſtra.Experience, their only miſtreſſe, can not teach the difference of diſeaſes, of complexions, and of the reſt. What though they can iudge of them in a large latitude, as to perceiue a difference betwixt a great diſeaſe and a light, betwixt ſtrength and weakneſſe? this euery ideot can do: as when two plots of ground are obiect to the eye, the one farre exceeding the other in greatneſſe, euery beholder perceiueth a great difference; but the iuſt proportion of that difference can not be found out, but by meaſuring them according to the rules of Geometry. So Empiriks for want of learning can not iudge of theſe things in ſo ſtrait a latitude as arte requireth. But beſide the foreſayd ten heads, other conſultations are neceſſary, whereof Empiriks are leſſe capable than of the former: as what veine is to be opened; whether a large or ſmall orifice be fitter; what quantity of bloud ſhould be taken; whether it be ſafer to doe it at once, or at ſundry times; whether emptying ſimply, or reuelling, or diuerting

be required; at what time of the diſeaſe it ſhould be done; how many things do inhibit opening of a veine, or perſwade delay. The learned Phyſician is bound by the rules of his Arte to conſult of all theſe and many other, before he dare attempt ſo great a worke: Audaci
                        •
                      imperitiam artu ſignificat. but the Empirike not foreſeeing the perill of omitting theſe conſultations, runneth raſhly into it, and abuſeth this excellent remedy to the loſſe of the life of many a patient, Hippoc▪ de arts. De Venae ſec. contra Eraſiſt.as Galen plainly ſheweth. Manie deadly errours in letting of bloud.Errours in this kinde are obuious and common to them: one openeth a veine vnder the tongue (by following ſome Engliſh booke, or imitating ſome learned Phyſician, not knowing the obſeruations neceſſary in that he attempteth) in a ſquinſie, the patient being full of blood and the diſeaſe in the beginning: whereupon followeth preſent ſuffocation, by drawing a greater flux to the place affected. An other, as ignorantly, openeth a veine on the arme vpon the criticall day, when there are ſignes of the criſis by bleeding at the noſe: by this action nature is croſſed in her regular courſe, and compelled to yeeld to the diſeaſe. A third omitteth letting of blood in a ſharpe diſeaſe, ſundry indications, which he vnderſtandeth not, concurring to perſwade it, and none to diſſwade. A fourth taketh away too little Deadly errours.blood in a great diſeaſe, or too much in a light. All theſe Empiriks increaſe their credit out of theſe deadly errours, by extolling their owne skill, falſifying ſtrange cures performed by them, and affirming that if they had come in time, they would not haue failed in the cure of theſe diſeaſes: now they had performed all that arte required: the beſt Doctour in the land could haue taken no other courſe. They that are eye and eare witneſſes of theſe ſecret tragoedies, can hardly ſuſpect the ignorance of theſe confident and glorious Empiriks to haue beene the cauſe of them. Thus you ſee Sir, how infortunate, or rather indiſcreet they are, that commit their bodies to the cure of an Empirike, whoſe ignorance often bringeth death, where the diſeaſe threateneth no danger at all.Miſerum est cùm ma

The Empiriks lance is oft times as deadly as the Butchers knife. He that promiſeth life with his tongue, bringeth the inſtrument of death in his hand.

Galen in many places doth inculcate the danger of opening a veine often; it waſteth & conſumeth the ſpirits, diminiſheth naturall heat & ſtrength, and haſteneth old age accompanied with many infirmities. Yet the common people, ignorant of this, flocke together to Empiriks in the Spring to be let bloud, as if it were a preſeruatiue againſt all diſeaſes. Few or none are refuſed,

becauſe they bring money; few receiue good, many hurt, becauſe the fornamed obſeruations are neglected. The blame of this publike hurt lieth iuſtly vpon the head of Empiriks, who partly for their owne gaine, and partly for want of iudgement, haue led the multitude into this errour.

This hath an vndoubted trueth in moſt purging medicines; the hurt and danger whereof commonly breaketh out when they are vſed by ſuch as can not order them according to Arte. In reſpect of this danger the Herbaliſt, and others that haue written of ſimple or compound purgers in our vulgar language, giue this neceſſary caution; Not to vſe them without the counſell of a learned Phyſician. And this is vſuall amongſt thoſe of our profeſſion; The further that any of them hath waded into the depth of it, and the profounder knowledge that he hath, the more hardly he is drawen to communicate the vſe of purgers with thoſe that haue not ſtudied the Arte: Purging is ſubiect to many dangers.becauſe the errors in giuing them are many and great; and the ſafe and fit vſe is hidden and locked vp with other myſteries of Phyſicke, in the writings of Hippoc. and Galen. A light errour herein bringeth oft times exceeding danger; if the medicine be too ſtrong, or too gentle; if the quantity faileth in defect or exceſſe; if the firſt qualities agree not with the diſeaſe and temper of the body; if it be haſtened before the iuſt time, or delayd after: the

Here the Artiſt diſcourſeth methodically of euery particular concerning this point, which I paſſe ouer to auoid tediouſneſſe, holding it ſufficient to point at the generals. After this point is cleered, and that Arte perſwadeth purging; then there ariſe other things very aduiſedly to be conſidered: as the nature of the humour offending; whether it requireth preparing, or not; in what part of the body it lieth moſt; what kinde of medicine is fitteſt; whether it ſhould be in a ſolide, or a liquid forme; whether it ſhould be brought out at once with a ſtrong medicine, or often with gentle, &c. Empiriks can not conſult of theſe things without Arte, much leſſe iudicially reſolue of ſo many intricate circumſtances and deepe points of learning: therefore their practiſe muſt be ſubiect to many errours.

This is their common purger, becauſe it worketh plentifully, and is of ſmall price: the one pleaſeth the vulgar, and the other profiteth themſelues.

There is one ſort of theſe Empiriks, that vſe but one kinde of purging drinke for all diſeaſes. This is a lamentable kinde of practiſe: it driueth many into vncurable dyſenteries, hectike feuers, and conſumptions, and caſteth them by heaps headlong into their graues. But I leaue theſe as the baſer ſort of them, and moſt woorthy to be purged out of the common wealth, and returne againe to the great magnifico's. Fluxus epidem. us.There was about ſix yeeres ſince an epidemiall or popular flux raging thorow moſt places of this land. This diſeaſe ſtood vpon great putrefaction and corruption of humors. The courſe for the cure was to reſiſt this putrefaction

to temper and prepare the matter offending, and to driue it out with gentle purgers fitted to the humor, complexion, ſtrength, and ſeaſon. Then the parts weakned were to be corroborated and ſtrengthened both by inward and outward medicines.

This was very acceptable to patients for a while, for it ſtayed the violent flowing of the humors, it procured preſent ſleepe, and mitigated paine. By this prepoſterous and dangerous courſe, though ſome few, that had ſtrong bodies, and receiued this medicine towards the end of the diſeaſe, when almoſt all the infectious matter was expelled, recouered their health; yet a great number had their lines cut off: Opium.

But it was ſtrange to ſee how the multitude flocked to thoſe that were boldeſt in the vſe of this medicine; for the fame of it for preſent remedy was ſpread abroad by them that gaue it, and the danger concealed. Thus the ſimple people greedy of the pleaſant bait, ſwallowed downe the killing hooke. It was not eaſie for one to take warning by another, the ſubtill Empiriks had ſo prouided for the credit both of the medicine and of themſelues: for when any died, they gaue out that the medicine was not giuen ſoone enough, (whereas the ſooner it commeth, the more perill it bringeth) or that the patient committed ſome fault, which was the cauſe ofhis death: for many had beene cured by this in other places. Another pernicious error, whereinto ignorance carrieth them, is to ſeeke out medicines in the titles of diſeaſes: as in ſome Engliſh bookes in the title of an Ague, they finde that Sorell is good for it, and Carduus ben

Experience helpeth no more towards that great building of the Art of Phyſicke, than that did towards a ſhip.

It is like to the walking of a blinde man in a knowen path, wherein, if there be a hole digged, or a blocke layed, he is in danger of falling ſo if there be any hidden thing in the diſeaſe, in the cauſes, or ſymptomes of it, as there is commonly, the Empirike is beyond his skill,Galen de locis aſſect. li. 3 he ſtumbleth and falleth; and the life of the ſicke is in ieopardy.

This grand reaſon of experience is further vrged of ſome by the example of Atturneys at the common law:Atturneys. moſt of theſe haue nothing to direct them but experience and obſeruation, and yet ſundry things paſſe thorow their hands as ſubſtantially and effectually performed, as by learned Counſellers: therefore vnlearned Phyſicians well inſtructed by experience may do ſome cures as well as great ſcholars. The anſwer to this is eaſie: There are many things in law which belong meerely to Atturneys, and require no learning: alſo they follow preſidents and vſuall formes, and many things wh ch they doe, are plaine tranſcripts, written out of bookes verbatim, wherein they cannot erre, if they follow their paterne. But it is farre otherwiſe in Phyſicke: there is no vſuall forme to follow in iudging or curing of diſeaſes; things ſeldome fall out after the ſame maner; the Phyſician muſt alter and change his courſe, as the diſeaſe and accidents require, wherein experience can not guide him, but the rules of the Arte. But if I ſhould grant that Empiriks are as Atturneys,

then it muſt follow that learned Phyſicians are as learned Counſellers: and as Atturneys in doubtfull caſes aske the opinion of them, ſo ſhould Empiriks do of the other: this would make their practiſe farre freer from danger, and preſerue the

But the caſe of an Atturney and of an Empirike is not alike: if by his fault his client loſe the day, the matter may ſomtimes be brought about againe; but if life be loſt by the error of the Empirike, it can not be reſtored.

This reaſon ſeemeth to proceed from one that vnderſtandeth his mother tongue only: for if his iudgement were confirmed by the knowledge of learned languages, he would not vrge this weake argument.

All nations Chriſtian, wherein the ciuill law is vſed, can not affoord one man of any meane account in that profeſſion, that vnderſtands not the Latine tongue, wherein their large books are written.

Fulneſſe of blood in the veines, and of ill humors in the body, are the common cauſes of moſt inward diſeaſes: here the learned Phyſician firſt collecteth all the ſignes of the diſeaſe, then he referreth them to their cauſes; and hauing diligently reuolued in in his minde all the indications belonging to the Art, he proceedeth to the cure by taking away the cauſe of the diſeaſe. The Empirike in the ſame caſe, not knowing how to gather the ſignes of the ſickneſſe, much leſſe how to referre them to their cauſes, attempteth the cure without conſultation, and by a weake and inartificiall coniecture openeth a veine, or giueth a violent purger; by both which raſh and vnaduiſed courſes many loſe their liues: but when any recouer, the cure may fitly be called caſuall, more by good hap than

Sometimes groſſe and gricuous errors are obſcured and hidden: for where the ſtrength of nature weareth them out, and the patient recouereth his health, the Empericke can neuer be ſtained with the blot of them. Therefore ſince almoſt all inward diſeaſes proceed from fulneſſe, ſome are cured in ſtrong bodies by emptying, though that be done confuſedly and without Arte. But this reaſon is further inforced, that ſundrie ſicke perſons recouer vnder them, which came out of the hands of learned Phyſitians. This is no argument of their knowledge, for in long diſeaſes patients are commonly deſirous of change, when ſomtimes the cauſe of the diſeaſe is taken awaie before, and nothing required but time to gather ſtrength. Moreouer they that are tired with long ſickneſſe, do vſually ſubmit themſelues to a ſtricter courſe both of medicines and diet vnder their ſecond Phyſitian: and though nothing be adminiſtred in either of theſe agreeable to Art, yet ſome few may eſcape, as a ſhippe or two, in the loſſe of a great fleet, may paſſe by rockes and ſands, and a

And although the beſt of theſe vnlearned Practitioners cannot preſcribe diet or medicine fitting to the temper of the body, and agreeing to the nature of the diſeaſe: yet a ſlender diet of roſted meats, and a drying drinke (which is a common courſe with them all) doth ſometimes cure an old diſeaſe proceeding from a cold and moiſt humour, though all things be done confuſedlie without order or methode.

But in this boaſting of ſecrets the common ſort are carried into a double errour: for Firſt, Empiriks haue no ſuch ſecrets: Secondly, if they had, they cannot make a fit and ſafe vſe of them. For the former, no man of iudgement can imagine that they haue them by their owne reading, that reade ſo little, & vnderſtand farre leſſe: and (that which is much more) that are ignorant of the languages, wherein it is moſt probable theſe ſecrets ſhould be incloſed. Neither is it credible that any learned man ſhould diſcouer them rather to this ignorant brood, than to thoſe of their owne ranke, learned and ingenious. All the ſecrets contained within the Art of Phyſicke are ſooneſt found out by the profoundeſt ſcholers & greateſt ſtudents. Therfore if any be in the hands of Empirikes: the ſame, yea many more are knowen to the learned. Touching the latter, it is euident (as hath beene partly prooued before) that diſeaſes are not cured by medicines & receits, but by a learned and methodical vſe of them, whereunto Empirikes cannot attaine. And if it were poſſible for any of them to ingroſſe all the ſecrets of the world, yet his practiſe ſhould deſerue neuer the better eſtimation, for they ſhould be but as ſo many ſharpe weapons in the hands of a mad man, wherewith it is liker he ſhould do hurt than good.

But to impart to you my confident opinion of theſe ſecrets grounded partly vpon my own obſeruation, and partly vpon intelligence from learned and honeſt Phyſitians: they are but triuiall and common things knowen to euerie meane Apothecarie, or of baſer account than the meaneſt drugge. One of theſe ignoraut and vaine glorious fellowes hauing ſpent a few moneths in following the warres beyond the ſeas, and being deſirous to liue at home with more caſe and leſſe perill, reſolued to become a Phyſitian. To the effecting heereof he procured ſome common receits from an Apothecarie and returned hither. Heere he gat ſome ſhifting companions to him, promiſing them part of his gaine, if they would extoll his skill and magnifie his medicines as rare and admirable ſecrets, farre fetched, and bought at a great price. An admirable ſecret diſcouered.Thus he obtained great fame. One of theſe medicines ſo highly commended, came by chance to the hands of an Apothecary: it was a very fine and pure white powder: and being diligently examined, it was found to be nothing but the ſimple powder of an egge ſhell: yet the coſener valued it as thirty ſhillings the ounce. Thus ſubtill and deceiptfull Empirikes grace their vile & contemptible medicines with the name of ſecrets, that they may the eaſier allure and illude the ſimple people, who are delighted with the ſuppoſed nouelty and rareneſſe of them. And as they deceiue many with that falſlie impoſed name, ſo they vſe another ſubtiltie to conceale them from thoſe that know all vſuall medicines by their colour, ſmell or taſte: for they mingle ſomething with them onely to alter theſe qualities. By this tricke, that ſauoureth of coſenage, and requireth a falſe tongue to purchaſe credit to it, many of our Empiriks extoll their fame and increaſe their wealth. All theſe things duely conſidered, may make the very name of a ſecret, out of the mouth of an Empirike, to be as a watchword to all men of iudgement to beware of the medicine, The ſubtiltie of

For they eſteeme too lightly of the deepe and intricate arte of Phyſicke, (wherein all the helps of nature do faile without a learned teacher, diligent and long ſtudy, and continuall meditation) and are too forward in commending and vſing them, that haue raked vp together a little practiſe out of Centoms co

                  Their skill in vrines. The fifth and laſt reaſon to grace Empirikes, is their great skill in vrines, whereby they oftentimes tel the diſeaſe as well as a learned Phyſitian. This maketh as little for their eſtimation, amongſt men of iudgement as any of the former. For diſeaſes haue many ſignes whereby they are made knowen, all which muſt be compared together and examined: the vrine is but one ſigne and that doubtfull and vncertaine:Many diſeaſes can not be knowne by the vrine. for thoſe diſeaſes that are in the leſſer veines, or in others parts of the bodie without the veines, cannot be diſcerned by it. The head is ſubiect to many diſeaſes that appeare not in the vrine: ſo are the eares, eies, noſe, mouth, throate, necke, breaſt, midrife, bowels, ioints, fleſh and skinne: diſeaſes incident to all theſe partes doe neuer diſcouer themſelues by the vrine alone. No medicine is to be giuen by the vrine alone.Moreouer ſometimes the ſame kind of vrine is to be ſeene in diſeaſes of a contrarie nature, as in a phrenſie, which is a hot diſeaſe, and in a cold diſtemper of the ſtomacke, the vrine is often in both of them pale and raw. In this caſe, he that giueth medicines out of the vrine, indangereth the life of the ſicke. For the deceitfull vrine purſueth hot medicines, which in a frenzie are deadly: alſo the vrine is ſometime red and high coloured as well in the weakeneſſe of the liuer, as in a vehement ague: if in the former, the Empirike truſting to the water (as many haue done in this caſe) openeth a veine, he ſendeth the patient headlong to the graue, Quò melior, ed peior.whom Arte might eaſily, or peraduenture nature would alone haue recouered. In the plague ſomtimes the better the water is, in the greater danger the ſicke is: for the peſtilent humour is impact into the hart, & nature not able to expell any of it. Foreſtus ſaith, Obſer. de pleurit.that in a great pleuriſie with a vehement ague, the water is ſometimes good, though the patient dieth. And euen in thoſe diſeaſes wherein the vrine affoordeth moſt knowledge, as when the diſeaſe is in the great veines, liuer, kidneies or bladder, there are ſudden changes and alterations able to hinder the iudgement of a learned Phyſician. Vrina hodiè bona, cras mala.Therefore Galen ſaith, the vrine is ſometimes good this day, ill to morrow, and the third day good againe. Beſide, rubarbe or ſaffron maketh it high coloured: ſo doth faſting, watching, and violent exerciſe. Leeks and ſuch like giueth it a greene tincture, and caſſia maketh it blacke. If you require further proofe of theſe bare aſſertions, and a full diſcourſe of the light and doubtfull coniectures that are gathered from vrines, I refer you to a learned treatiſe written of that argument by Foreſtus. There it is ſubſtantiallie Vromantia.prooued by ſound reaſons, and the teſtimonies of our moſt famous authours, that the vrine in moſt diſeaſes giueth no light to a learned  Phyſician, wherby he may find out the diſeaſe without other ſignes.  That no medicine can fitly be preſcribed by the vrine alone. That  it can not ſhew conception, nor yet diſtinguiſh ſex certainly. That this cuſtome of ſending vrines to Phyſicians was not vſed amongſt the ancients and learned Phyſicians, Neither conception knowne nor ſexe diſtinguiſhed by vrine.nor is at this day in Italy and other places: but that it is newly brought in by ignorant and deceitfull 
                  
Empirikes partly for their owne gaine gaine, and partly to diſgrace learned and honeſt Phyſicians, who abhorre to tell ſtrange and plauſible things out of the vrine, which Arte and a good conſcience cannot iuſtifie. Lib. 2. cap. 3. Portentoſa & ſplendida mendacia, impostura & fraude referea.The foreſaid Authour in the ſame booke, ſpeaking of theſe vnlearned Phyſicians, ſaith, their diſcourſe out of vrine conteineth nothing but monſtrous and glorious lies, full of coſenage and deceite. And by this fooliſh babling out of the vrine, the vulgar are caught in a ſnare, ſpoiled of their mony, and often depriued of their liues. The leſſe knowledge an Emperike hath, the larger diſcourſe he maketh out of vrine, the more ſubtillie he examineth the meſſenger, and gathering from him part of the diſeaſe, he repeateth the ſame in other words, amplifying and enlarging his ſpeech, ſo as the ſimple hearer imagineth that he vttereth much knowledge out of the vrine: but if any man of iudgement heard him talke, he ſhould find no truth in the matter, nor any ſenſe in the words. If it pleaſe you to conſider what manner of men moſt of theſe Empirikes are, (ſuch as haue forſaken that occupation or laſt and laborious courſe of life wherein they were brought vp in their youth, and addicted themſelues to profeſſe that Arte whereof they are vtterly ignorant) you may eaſily perceiue that they are compelled to vſe all ſtaudulent and deceitfull meanes to eſtabliſh their credit. Ignorance cannot purchaſe eſtimation, vnleſſe it be couered with the cloake of knowledge. Craft and ſubtilty will preuaile when ſimple and honeſt dealing ſhalbe of no account. Large and ſtrange talke, be it neuer ſo fooliſh and falſe, is pleaſing to the multitude, but bare and naked truth, vttered in few words, is lightly regarded. Falſe diſcourſe out of vrines.This allureth the common people to flocke to Empirikes and leaue learned Phyſicians: for there they ſhall heare that the braine is periſhed, the hart is ſwelled, the lungs are conſumed, the liuer is dried and the ſpleene waſted: and in all theſe they will warrant the cure: whereas firſt it is certaine, they can diſcern none of theſe by the vrine:The facilitie of iudgeing of vrines as Emperiks doe. and then it is as certaine that they can cure none of them. Their light coniectures out of vrines ſtand vpon ſuch caſie and plaine rules, that a ſimple woman vſed to be about the ſicke, may vnderſtand them. For ſicke vrines are for the moſt part high coloured, or very pale. In the former, they ſpeake of a feuer that offendeth the head, procureth ſhort and troubled ſleepes, taketh away appetite, bringeth a loathſome taſte to the mouth, oppreſſeth the heart, and cauſeth paine in the backe: this leſſon ſerueth for all yrines of that colour: and oft times it fareth thus with the patient, for moſt agues haue theſe common ſymptomes. In pale vrines they haue another leſſon: there they pronounce the ſtomacke to be weak, flegme to abound, want of digeſtion, heauineſſe after meat, inclination to ſleepe, the body full of winde and ſubject to ſtitches. Theſe two obſeruations with a nimble tongue, and much tautologie are ſufficient to get a great opinion amongſt the multitude. Vnto theſe

                  An hiſtorie of a couſening Empirike.A poore man brought his wiues vrine to a famous Empirike: it was in winter, and ſome of the water was ſpilt and frozen on the outſide of the pot. The Phyſician marking the heauie countenance of the fellow, coniectured thereby that the patient was ſome deere friend of his, and very ſicke. And hauing viewed the vrine, he ſaid, is not this your wiues vrine? I perceiue ſhe is very ill. The ſimple clowne anſweared, Sir, your skill is excellent: you haue iudged right. But what ſee you more? The ſubtill Empirike ſeeing the vrine to be well coloured, and to giue no ſuſpition of any inward diſeaſe, geſſed it to be ſome outward thing. The credulous and fooliſh man ſaid, I wonder at your cunning: go on I pray you and tell me how her ſide came to be blacke and blew. The Empirike taking hold of theſe plaine words, imagined that it happened by ſome fall or blow, and asked him if ſhe had not a fall. He taking this queſtion to be an abſolute and vndoubted aſſertion, ſtill magnified his skill, and ſaid further vnto him, if you can tell me where and how ſhe fell, I will hold you to be the onely Phyſician in this land. The Empirike ſmiling at his ſimplicity, and conſidering with himſelfe the manner and faſhion of poore country houſes, anſwered, it was like ſhe fell off a ladder. This ſimple fellow admiring the anſweares as proceeding from rare and extraordinarie skill, asked further if he could ſee in the vrine from how many ſtaues ſhe fell. He preſuming that the poore mans houſe was low, ſaid, from eight ſtaues: the clowne not ſatisfied with this, ſhaked his head, and deſired him to looke better in the vrine, and he ſhould find more. This crafty impoſter perceiuing that he had geſſed too few, and remembring that which he had ſpied before on the pot, demanded of him, if he ſpilt none of the water by the way, which being confeſſed, he ſaid, there you may finde the reſt of the ſtaues, for I am aſſured there are no more to be ſeene in this vrine. This is their vſuall maner of telling wonders out of the water, when they meet with rude & ſeelie people. Liquidò co

                     ſtat, &c.Therefore the ſame authour ſaith, it is cleere that this diuining Arte of telling ſtrange and admirable things out of vrines, is meere coſenage, whereby they do craftily circumuent and deceiue the credulous and vnwarie multitude. How light account Hipp. made of vrines in reſpect of other ſignes, doth plainly appeare in that he wrot ſo largely of them, and ſo ſparingly of this. De praeſag.For diſcourſing of ſharpe diſeaſes, he filleth all the firſt booke, and part of the ſecond with other ſignes and marks to know and iudge them by, before he maketh any mention of the vrine: and when he commeth to that, he paſſeth it ouer briefly. The pulſe alſo giueth a farre greater light to the Phyſician, than the vrine.Vires agrotantium medicorum hera. Therefore Gal. wrot 18. bookes of that, which are extant, beſides that vpon Archigines, which are loſt; and not one of this. Rhaſes ſaith, the

ſtrength of the ſicke is the miſtreſſe of Phyſicians, and the vrine neuer ſheweth that ſtrength conſiſteth of the ſymmetry and perfect temper and proportion of the naturall, vitall and animall ſpirits. The fountaine of the firſt is in the liuer: of the ſecond in the hart: of the third in the braine. The vrine ſheweth a little of the firſt: much leſſe of the ſecond, which is farre more to be regarded: and nothing at all of the third. If they that had the perfection of Arte cannot iudge of the ſtrength of the ſicke by the vrine, into what danger doe Emperiks bring their patients in purging and letting of bloud by the vrine alone? they muſt either arrogate to themſelues farre deeper inſight into vrines, than theſe men had, which is abſurd, or elſe confeſſe that they haue led the people into a groſſe and dangerous error, by perſwading them that their diſeaſes may be perfectly knowen and perceiued by that alone. I haue preſumed vpon your patience in being ſo long in this point, becauſe it is the great pillar of their credit.
               
                   
                  The cauſes of Empiriks fame.Now I come to the fourth and laſt part, which is to ſhew the cauſes of Empirikes fame. Theſe are deriued partly from themſelues, and partly from the vulgar. Some of thoſe from themſelues haue beene touched before, as the extolling and magnifying their owne cures, both with their owne mouthes, and by procuring popular fellowes which frequent Innes and Tauerns, to be trumpetters and ſounders abroad of their praiſe, without any regard of truth.

Some of them ſhew to their patients and acquaintance ſuch bookes as themſelues vnderſtand not, as if they learned their practiſe out of them. Others haue anatomies of mens bodies, which they ſhew at euery opportunitie, holding the beholders with long and fooliſh diſcourſe out of them, and pointing at the very place, where they imagine the diſeaſe to be ſeated. This pleaſeth plaine and vnlearned perſons exceedingly, and bringeth them into a confident opinion of the truth of all that is vttered, and alſo of profound knowledge to be contained in it: in both which they are deceiued, for ignorance is an inſeparable marke to all Empirikes, and falſhood to moſt.Empiriks ſteale cures. It is vſuall with the beſt of them falſely to grace themſelues by ſtealing away the credit of other mens

cures: as when a learned Phyſician preſcribed a courſe to a patient, and by reaſon of the diſtance of place, or his emploiment otherwiſe, leaueth the execution of this to one of them dwelling neere: if this patient recouereth, the Empirike maketh it his owne cure, and yet he was but the inſtrument directed by another, and did no more then belongeth to an Apothecarie. This fraudulent deuiſe hath added much to the credit of ſome: for when any of theſe cures are performed, the Empirike publiſheth with proteſtation that he folowed not the courſe ſet downe by the Phyſician, but tooke another farre fitter and more effectuall.

There are yet more deuiſes amōgſt them to inlarge their credit, for ſome of them are riſen to that height of impudency, that they bluſh not to brag of their degrees taken in the Vniuerſity, and that they haue diſputed with Doctors, and beene approued by them, and might take that degree: and yet they neuer came in any ſchole of learning, nor are more able to reaſon with any yong ſtudent in that profeſſion, than to contend with a Lion in ſtrength. Their large promiſes.Moreouer they promiſe the cure of all diſeaſes committed to them, wherein when they faile, they impute the fault to ſome error committed by the patient, or to ſome ſecret thing in the body, which Arte could not foreſee. Alſo they make diſeaſes ſeeme greater and more dangerous than they are indeed: affirming euery light cough to be a conſumption of the lungs: euery common ague to be a burning ſeuer: euery ſtitch on the ſide to be a pleuriſie: euery little ſwelling in the body or feet to be a dropſie euery old vlcer to be a fiſtula, and euery ordinarie bile in time of infection to be the plague: by this deceit they get much more money, and farre greater credit, when they cure any of theſe, than they ſhould do if they dealt truly. Their falſe tongues.Further they perſwade their familiars that they are vſed in their profeſſion by the chiefe perſonages in, or neere the place they inhabit, often naming thoſe whom they neuer ſaluted. Laſt of all they conceale the courſe of their practiſe from all that can iudge of it: for the better effecting where of they neuer ſend their bils to the Apothecaries, as learned Phyſicians doe, nor will admit any other of that profeſſion to haue acceſſe to their patients. For their owne conſciences accuſing them of ignorance, they may iuſtly feare that by either of theſe meanes their vnfit and dangerous practiſe ſhould be diſcouered, and conſequently their credit impaired. Heere they are often compelled to arrogate much vnto themſelues, and to aſſure their patients that they are not inferiour to any man in the skill of their profeſſion. Thus masked ignorance, affecting and pretending knowledge, is induced to violate both naturall and religious lawes, in preferring gaine and eſtimation before the health and liues of

men: in ſuffering none to be admitted to thoſe cures which themſelues cannot perfect, & might with facility be performed by others. By theſe and ſuch like reaſons they increaſe their reputation and inlarge their practiſe amongſt the common ſort. Other reaſons heereof are drawen from the ſimplicity of the vulgar, who being vtterly ignorant of the cauſes of naturall things, are thereby void of ſuſpition and ſo credulous that they beleeue euery thing they heare of theſe Empirikes, and are by theſe meanes brought into an ouerweening of them. Out of this erronious opinion they aſcribe as much  vnto them, as vnto the profoundeſt Phyſicians. Lib. 1. de nat. Deorum.
                  Tully reporteth that they which inhabited the Iland called Seryphus, and neuer went out of it, where they ſaw no other beaſts but hares and foxes,Seryphi nati, nec unquam egreſſi, &c. would not beleeue that there were lions or panthers in the world: and if any man told them of the elephant, they thought themſelues mocked. So it is with the ſimple multitude, they know onely their neighbour Empirikes, which are but as hares and foxes: and if they heare of lions, that is, a ſort of Phyſicians, as farre aboue them in the knowledge of the Arte, as the lion is aboue the hare and fox in ſtrength, they will not be brought into that opinion, but reiect it as a falſe and fained fable: for the firſt conceit of the admirable skill they imagine to be in thoſe whom they know, hath taken ſo deepe root in their mindes that it cannot be plucked out. How Empirikes, be they neuer ſo ignorant, are magnified by the ſimplicity of the rude and ſottiſh people,A tale of an Empirike, a foole and an aſſe. 
                  Poggius ſetteth foorth in this tale: there was one of the meaneſt of theſe Empirikes that had but one kind of pill for all diſeaſes or infirmities whatſoeuer: and by this together with his cogging, had purchaſed great fame, and was eſteemed cunning in all things. There came vnto him a fooliſh clowne that had loſt his aſſe, deſiring his counſell for the finding of him: the Empirikes skill reached not beyond his pill, yet ſeeming to be ignorant in nothing, and deſirous to take his money, he gaue him that to ſwallow downe, and told him that by the vertue thereof he ſhould find his aſſe againe. The ſimple felow, returning homewards, felt the operation of his pill, and going out of the high way into a field, ſpied his aſſe feeding there: thus being in poſſeſſion of that which he had loſt, he confidently beleeued that this was wrought by the extraordinarie learning of this coſening Empirike, and extolled him aboue all other Phyſicians. Credulity leadeth men into many groſſe opinions, and ſpecially in this Arte.Lib. 29. cap. 1. in hac artium ſola eu

                  Pliny ſaith, it falleth out onely in this Art, that credit is giuen to euery one that profeſſeth himſelfe skilful in it, when as no lie bringeth greater danger. Moreouer the baſe opinion that the ignorant multitude conceiueth of the deepe and profound Arte of Phyſicke, maketh much for Empirikes: The ſimplicity of the vulgar.for the common people hauing nothing in themſelues, but that which experience and obſeruation hath taught them, cannot lift vp their dull conceits any

higher, but confidently imagine that all knowledge is obtained by that alone, and needeth no helpe of ſcholes. Therefore they iudge no otherwiſe of this learned and myſticall profeſſion, than of ordinarie mechanicall trades, ſuppoſing it to be as ſoone and eaſily learned, as the plaine craft of a tailer or carpenter. This fooliſh and ſenſeles opinion increaſeth the reputation of Empirikes and procureth them many patients: for heereby their light and ſuperficiall skill is eſteemed equall to the complete and ſound knowledge that is in the moſt iudiciall profeſſors of that Arte. Euen as a plaine countrie fidler is thought by his neighbours not to be inferiour to cunning Muſicians. Another reaſon that moueth the vulgar to vſe them, is the hope they haue to be cured by them with leſſe charge. But this deceiueth them on both ſides, for oft times their diſeaſes are left vncured, and commonly the ſubtill Empirike draweth more money from them than a learned Phyſician would doe. Their practiſe is alſo further inlarged by the ignorance of the common ſort, who when they are ſicke, vſe to inquire after one that hath cured the like diſeaſe. Heere is worke for theſe popular fellowes, who haue filled many credulous eares with a falſe report of their cures.The cuſtome of the Egyptians. I confeſſe it was an ancient cuſtome amongſt the Egyptians to lay their ſicke in open places, and to inquire of them that paſſed by, what they had heard or tried to haue holpen in the like caſe. But this was before the Arte of Phyſicke was perfected and brought into a methode. Phyſicians are to be made choiſe of by their learning, not by their cures.Now the caſe is farre altered: there is a learned and iudiciall courſe confirmed and eſtabliſhed for the cure of all diſeaſes. Therefore now the patient is to enquire after him that hath greateſt knowledge and ſoundeſt iudgement in the Art, and not after him that is reported to haue cured the like ſickneſſe: for many cures are falſely attributed to Empirikes: and beſides that, ſome diſeaſes are healed by chance, and ſome by nature, as is before ſhewed. There is yet another errour in the multitude that profiteth theſe ignorant men much. For many binde themſelues to that Phyſician whom they haue vſed before, be he neuer ſo ignorant, ſuppoſing that he knoweth the ſtate of their bodie better than a ſtranger. But in this they are alſo vtterly deceiued, for no Empirike can know the ſtate of any mans body: No Empirike knoweth the ſtate of any mans body.Philoſophy teacheth that and not experience. All that he can know is but whether the body be eaſie or hard to purge, and what is that in reſpect of all other things before mentioned, which are neceſſarie in euerie Phyſician? Therefore let euery man of iudgement vſe him that can by Art find out the complexion and conſtitution of his body: that knoweth how to diſtinguiſh one diſeaſe from another, and proſecute the courſe fit for the cure, turning and altering it to euery occurrent. And let him that hath recouered out of the hands of an Empirike, reſt ſatisfied in his happy fortune, and euer after commit his body to the beſt learned. Theſe are the weake and lame reaſons whereupon

the fame and great practiſe of theſe ignorant men is built.

The Phyſicians of the colledge of London take an oath at their admittance, to purſue vnlearned Empirikes and impoſtors, confounding the names, as if all Empirikes were coſeners. Thriuer in Celſ. lib, 1. cap. 1.One calleth the baſer ſort of them, analphabetos nebulones, not hauing learned their criſſecroſſe. No man can heere obiect with iudgement, that all theſe learned men wrot out of a weake perturbation, & that it was, as the Poet ſaith, one enuying another:

                  and that theſe are contentions amongſt Phyſicians riſing from varietie of opinions, as in other profeſſions. For all theſe men oppugned are vtterly ignorant and vnlearned, and dare neuer attempt to ſpeake one word of their profeſſion in the preſence of a learned Phyſician. It is therefore knowledge againſt ignorance:Scientia contra ignorantiam. naturall and chriſtian compaſſion mouing theſe learned & ingenious men to protect the liues of their brethren by oppoſing themſelues to the blind practiſe of Empirikes, who fight with their eies ſhut againſt ſickeneſſe, Andibatarum more clauſis oculi

I remember a ſtory of a blind woman famous for her skill in Phyſicke, by whoſe dore a porter paſſing with a heauy burthen vpon his back, fell downe and cried out for helpe: the compaſſionate woman came ſpeedily with aqua vitae, and feeling for his mouth, offered to powre in ſome, whereas halfe an eie would haue ſerued her to haue eaſed him of his burthen. All Empitiks are blinde.It is vſuall with Empirikes, for want of the eie of learning, to bring as ridiculous and ſenſeles meanes of helpe to their patients: for when they ſee not the cauſe of the diſeaſe (as they do very ſeldome ſee it fully) they cannot fit a medicine to it. They may fondly purpoſe, fooliſhly conſult, and largely promiſe to performe great matters in Phyſicke:Hermogenes apes. but in execution they will be found like to Hermogenes his apes, who aſſembled themſelues together to take counſell how they might be ſecured from the violent incurſions and aſſaults of greater beaſtes, they concluded to builde

a ſtrong fort: they agreed vpon the matter and forme thereof. Euery onè was aſſigned to his ſeuerall worke: ſome to cut downe timber, ſome to make bricke, other for other offices. But when they met to begin this great building, they had not one inſtrument or toole to worke withall, ſo their counſell was ouerthrowen. So Empirikes may attempt to build vp health in a ſicke body: they may promiſe the cure of diſeaſes; but what can be expected at their hands ſith they want all the tooles of Galen and Hippocrates neceſſarie for ſo great a worke? Empiriks as vnskilfull pilots.The conſideration of all theſe things hath often moued me to compare their patients to them that croſſe the ſeas in a ſmal leaking boate with an vnskilful pilot: they may arriue ſafe at the wiſhed hauen: but wiſedome truſteth to the ſtrongeſt meanes, which alwaies promiſe, and commonly performe greateſt ſecuritie. One thing I will adde more of this odious generation: the multitude of them in this country is incredible. Out of one rotten and maligne ſtocke ſpring many riotous branches. Mali corui malum ouum.One maſter ſendeth foorth many iourneymen, which haue beene his apprentiſes. If theſe old breeders be maintained, we ſhall haue, within theſe few yeeres, more Empirikes, than butchers; more killers of men, than of oxen. The great number of Empiriks.The number of them is ſo increaſed, that they are at enmity one with another. It is a ſport to heare one of the moſt eminent of them (being placed in a chaire for his great skill) raile vpon vnlearned Phyſicians, The hering man mockes the fiſher man.and yet he himſelfe was neuer admitted vnto Grammar ſchoole. But this doth exempt them from all ſuſpition of ignorance amongſt the vulgar, and procureth them many patients. But the more they are admired, and the greater number of patients they haue, the more they exceed in craft and falſhood. Ignorance can not purchaſe admiration. For ignorance  cannot purchaſe admiration, vnleſſe craft and ſubtilty be ioint-purchaſers with her. But to draw to an end, ſith Empirikes are vtterlie diſabled by the difficultie of the Arte of Phyſicke: The concluſion.by their education in their youth▪ by the want of grammer, logicke and philoſophy: by their palpable ignorance in the theorie and ſpeculation of that they profeſſe: by the manifold errors they fall into. Sith experience cannot teach them the methode and order of curing diſeaſes: nor reading of Engliſh bookes affoord them any mediocrity of knowledge. Sith moſt of their cures are naturall, or caſuall: all their ſecrets triuiall and common ▪ their diſcourſe out of vrines, grounded vpon ſubtiltie and deceit: their fame and multitude of patients riſing from fraude and falſhood in themſelues, or from follie in the vulgar. Finally, ſith there is a full conſent of all learned Phyſicians iuſtlie condemning them. I may firmly conclude that their practiſe is alwaies confuſed, commonly dangerous and often deadly. Therefore whereas Ludouicus 
                  De indic bonum medicamentum eſt &c.
                  Mercatus ſaith, it is a good medicine ſometimes to take no medicine at all. And 
                     Ʋromant.
                  Foreſtus affirmeth, ſometimes the whole worke is to be left to nature, which when Empiriks

ſee not, they often kill the ſicke. In my opinion this diſtinction of time may be cut off, and both theſe ſayings made generall; for where the pactiſe is wholly ingroſſed by theſe men, there the beſt medicine is alwaies to take no medicine at all: No medicine to be taken of Empiriks.and the whole worke is euer to be left to nature, rather then to be committed to any of theſe. For though they cure ſome, yet they kill many: the way of erring in the practiſe of Phyſicke is ſo ample and broad, and the path, leading to the methodicall cure of diſeaſes, ſo narrow and ſtraight. Thus, Sir, you haue that which you required, directions for your health, and my opinion of Empirikes. God almighty bleſſe you with the benefit of the former, or preſerue you from the perill of the latter.
