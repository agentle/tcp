deceaſed, for ſale of certayne Lands and Leaſes by him purchaſed, for payment of ſuch
Moneyes, as was owing by him vnto them, and are yet vnpaid.
            
            
               The Preamble.
               WHereas the ſaid Frith (being a Putter forth of much money for other men at Intereſt) after he had got ſuch credit, that
many men truſted him with great Summes vpon his owne Securitie, and others became bound with him; and had
purchaſed in Lands and Leaſes, aboue 1600 pounds per Annum: Hee was arreſted and laid in the Fleete, whence
he procured himſelfe to be remooued, into the Priſon of the Kings Bench; where he became Felo de ſe. Sithence whoſe death,
neither the ſaid Lands nor Leaſes were forfeited by his Felonie, nor yet ſubiect to the payment of his Debts (for ſome were conuayed
ouer to other men in truſt, ſome were purchaſed partly in the name of his Wife, and partly in the names of his Children,
and other ſome were morgaged for monies borrowed) but are enioyed, partly by his Wife and Children, and partly by colour
of a Decree, and vertue of an Iniunction; which Decreeis made in ſhew for all the ſaid Creditors, but indeed for Three of them
onely: So that thoſe Creditors, to whom the ſaid Decree in ſhew onely doth extend, and who in equitie ought alſo to enioy the
benefit thereof, are vtterly defeated of their debts; whereby ſome of them are ſithence become decayed in their eſtates, other ſuffer
impriſonment for his the ſaid Friths debts, others haue periſhed in Priſon for the ſame, and others are in imminent danger
vtterly to be vndone, and alſo there to periſh: Except that by his Maieſties moſt gracious fauour, they may bee releeued out of
thoſe Lands and Leaſes aforeſaid; Wherefore the ſaid Creditors are moſt humble Suiters, that it may be enacted:
            
            
               The Act, contayning Nine Branches.
               
                  
That a Commiſſion bee awarded, to fiue or ſeuen certayne Commiſſioners (viz. ſuch as haue beene either high Shirifes of Eſſex (where moſt of the ſaid Lands doe lie) or ſuch as be Common Councell men, or called to bee Shirifes of London) And
that thoſe Commiſſioners, or the moſt parte of them, may haue authoritie to call before them, all ſuch of the ſaid Creditors, as
ſhall within three moneths next after this Seſſion of Parliament, haue their names entred in the Aſſurance Office, in the Royall

Exchange in London, where ſhall bee paid to the Clerke, that ſhall there enter the ſame, Sixe pence. And that euery ſuch
Creditor, as ſhall be Contributor to the charges of this Act and the ſaid Commiſſion, ſhall be capable of the benefit thereof, and

none other. And that the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall examine, view, and ſee, all the ſpecialties, proofes, and euidences, which
any of the ſaid Creditors ſhall produce for proofe of the Debts vnto any of them owing by the ſaid Frith, either by matter of
record, or the oathes of ſuch as any of them haue formerly produced, or ſhall produce, to proue the ſame; And ſhall examine vpon
oath, either the ſaid Creditors themſelues, or any other, how much of thoſe Debts are or is vnpaid: And ſhall cauſe
thereupon a Schedule indented to be made, contayning the ſame Debts ſo prooued and vnpaid, and the names vnto whom they
be owing: Of which Schedule, one parte to be left at the Capitall Meſſuage of the Mannor of Vpminſter in Eſſex; and the other
parte to remayne with any of the ſaid Commiſſioners: And ſhall, within ſixe weekes after the leauing thereof at the Meſſuage aforeſaid,
cauſe a Writing thereof to be publiſhed, on ſome Sabbath day, after Diuine Seruice, in the Pariſh Church of Vpminſter;
and afterwards cauſe the ſame Writing, to be fixed to the dore of the ſame Church, to the end the Wife and Children of the

ſaid Frith, may haue notice thereof. And if neither the ſaid Wife nor Children, ſhall, within Three months after the Publication
and leauing of the ſaid Schedule, pay nor cauſe to be paid, vnto all and euery the ſaid Creditors named in the ſaid Schedule,
reſpectiuely the Debts ſo ſpecified in the ſame Schedule; Then the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall cauſe a Iurie to be empannelled, and
inquire what Lands, Annuities, and Leaſes, the ſaid Frith, or any other in truſt, were ſeazed or poſſeſſed of, at the time of his
death, and what Lands, Annuities, and Leaſes, he had purchaſed in his owne name, or in the name of any other in truſt (whether
the Deeds thereof made, doe expreſſe the ſame truſt or not) which were and did remayne in them, or any of them, at the
time of his deceaſe, and where the ſame doe lie, and in whoſe occupation they, or any parte of them, ſhall bee then remayning.
And thereof, or of ſo much thereof, as ſhall be found ſufficient to ſatisfie the ſaid Debts, with ſuch dammages as the ſaid Commiſſioners
ſhall giue and allow (if the ſame will afford ſo much) the ſaid Commiſſioners, or the greater parte of them, ſhall by

Deed indented and inrolled make ſale. Prouided, that compoſition ſhall be made, by the Purchaſers of Copie or Cuſtomarie
Lands, with the Lords of the Mannors; and that thereupon the ſaid Lords, ſhall grant the Vendee, by Copie of Court roll,

the ſame Copie or Cuſtomarie Lands, and admit them Tenants. And that it may be further enacted, that if the monies ariſing
by the ſale of all the ſaid Lands, Annuities, and Leaſes, will not ſuffize to ſatisfie all the Debts ſpecified in the ſaid Schedule;
Then the monies ariſing of the ſaid ſale, ſhall be paid to all the Creditors named in the ſaid Schedule, euery one proportionably
to his debt ſet downe in the ſame Schedule: But if there ſhall be made more monies by the ſaid ſale, then will ſuffize to
pay thoſe debts with reaſonable dammages as aforeſaid; Then the ouerplus ſhall bee paid, to the Wife and Children of the ſaid

                  Frith, to be diuided amongſt them as the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall thinke meete. And vpon payment of ſuch monies, as
ſhall be paid to any of the ſaid Creditors by vertue of that Act and of the ſaid Commiſſion, the Securitie and Aſſurance of euery

of the ſaid Creditors which ſhall bee ſo paid (whether it bee by record or otherwiſe) ſhall be vtterly void. Sauing and reſeruing

to our Soueraigne Lord the King, &c. other then the ſaid Frith, &c. all and euery their former right, &c. And laſtly,
that all and euery Clauſe, Article, and thing contayned in the ſame Act, may be conſtrued, deemed, and taken, to the moſt auaile
of ſuch, as ſhall purchaſe any of the ſaid Lands, Annuities, or Leaſes.
