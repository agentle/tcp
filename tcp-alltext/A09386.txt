               RIght Worshipfull, amongst the manifold points of Christian Religion, the trueth of the Doctrine cōcerning Predestination is worthy serious and sober study for the sound vnderstanding thereof. For first, it is something difficult & obscure. Secondly, because it is by some eagerly impugned, as a friuolous and forged inuention of mans braine. Thirdly, diuers opinions haue passed from diuers mē diuersly about this one point; whereas



notwithstanding there is but one truth, and one definite and constant sentence to be found in holy writ concerning it. Fourthly, this one doctrine doth giue very good euidence, and an ample demonstration of Gods infinite mercie and exact iustice. Fiftly, it affordeth some taste of his profound and impenetrable counsell. Sixtly, it doth notably manifest his admirable wisdome and policie, and the incorruptible purity of his nature, who wisely disposeth all things, and vseth euen euils without iniustice, and the least receipt or infusion of corruption; and all for the manifestation of the glory of his Name, and of the splendour of his renowmed properties. Seuenthly, it confoundeth the common cauill of many desperate and infatuated Atheists, who would make Gods predestination the pillar of their sensuall security, and secure sensualitie. Lastly, it ministreth exceeding comfort vnto those, who renouncing the kingdome of Sinne, do liue like



Saints in the kingdome of Grace. First, because it is not possible for any such to sinne with full consent of heart. Secondly, because no personall merits are required of them. Thirdly, because the Spirit of God abideth in them, who is busy within the hiue of their hearts as a Bee, and worketh them like waxe. Fourthly, because God hath eternally predestinated them to eternall ioyes, and those also incomprehensible and ineffable. Fiftly, because God hath in abundance vouchsafed that to them being but an handfull, which hee hath denyed to whole heapes besides. Sixtly, for that they being elected, can in no wise perish, for the counsell of the Lord shall stand for euer, Psal. 33. 11. And hee loueth them with an euerlasting loue, Ieremy 3. 4. Though a Mother should forget her Child, yet he will not forget them, for he hath grauen them vpon the palme of his hand, Isay 49. 15, 16. therefore hee



will confirme them vnto the end, 1. Cor. 1. 8. and by his power keepe them vnto saluation, 1. Pet. 1. 5. He will loue them cōstantly, though he visit their transgressions with rods, Psal. 89. 32, 33. He will neuer turne away from them, though he Iere. 32. 40. Ioh. 16. 12. take them by the neck (as Iob speaketh) and beat them, though he cut their reines and breake them, and though he powreth their gall vpon the ground, and runneth vpon them like a Gyant. Ioseph did affect his brethren entirely, though hee spake roughly to them. Hee may also sometimes let them fall, as a louing Nurse may her child, but he will lift them vp againe; therefore howsoeuer they may fall, yet they shall not fall away. Indeed Piptein. they may leaue their first loue, as the Ecpiptein Church of Ephesus did, but they shall neuer leaue to loue at all, if euer they loued Reu. 2. 4. truly. For (as Paul sayth) Loue doth neuer fall away, it may be lessened, but it cannot 1. Cor. 13 8. be lost. In like manner, their faith may



be couered, as the Sunne with a duskie cloud in a gloomy day: or as the trees are with snow sometimes in winter; but yet it continueth firmely fixed (though now and then eclipsed) in the sphaere of the heart, and keepeth sap in the roote. For the righteous man is as a tree planted by the riuers of waters, Psal. 1. 3. and is built by that great builder of heauen and earth vpon a rock, Math. 16. 18. These comforts will this one doctrine affoord, being throughly pondered and vnderstood. And no doubt these and the like considerations mooued that holy and learned man of blessed memory, to publish this present treatise for the benefit of the Church, and the same haue also incited vs to turne it out of the toong wherein he wrote it, into the English, for their profit who are ignorant in the other; and the rather, because it is contriued and penned very plainely, soundly, and succinctly, as the subiect will permit. The



which (Right Worshipfull) assuring our selues of your vnfeigned loue vnto the truth, we do present and dedicate to you, in token of deserued gratitude for vndeserued kindnesse, not doubting of your courteous and kinde acceptance. And thus we humbly take our leaues, recommending you and all yours to the protection of Iehoua. Rochester, this 19. of February. 1605.

               RIght Worshipfull, as many other wholsome and heauenly doctrines grounded vpō the word of God, haue beene and are to this day contradicted and impugned: euen so it fareth with the diuine and deepe doctrine of Gods Predestination; a doctrine not more heauenly, then wholsome, nor more commodious, then comfortable, & yet as heauenly & as commodions,

as any doctrine whatsoeuer, which the Scriptures do affoord. The Pelagians held, that God predestinated men to life or death, as he did foresee that they would by their naturall free will receiue or reiect grace offered. They taught, that it was in mans power to beleeue, or not to beleeue: they placed the causes of saluation in men themselues out of God, and held, that the Elect might fall from grace and perish.
            Others hold, that albeit the Lord electeth some of his meere mercy without respect of any thing in them, that yet he reiecteth those which are reiected, because he did foresee that they would reiect his grace offered vnto them in the Gospell. Some Vbiquitaries hold, that Adams fall came to passe without Gods decree, or any ordination of 
                  〈◊〉
               : secondly, that no decree of God dependeth vpon his sample will, concerning the saluation of the godly, or the reiection of the Reprobate: thirdly, that God doth vtterly nill the reprobation of 
                  〈◊〉
               y: fourthly, that the Reprobate may bee conuerted and saued: 
                  〈◊〉
               ly, that Christ dyed for the reprobates,



and that it is the purpose and will of God simply, that all men without exception should be saued. Some do subiect Election vnto Gods eternall decree, but not Reprobation. Others, putting no difference betweene Reprobation and Damnation, do thinke, as God doth passe by some men of his meere pleasure, that he doth in like sort damne them of his meere will and pleasure, whereas indeed sinne is the cause why men are damned. Many of the Romish synagogue do teach, that men are elected for their foreseene faith, and meritorious works. And it is the common opinion of all Papists, that the Elect cannot be certaine and sure of their election, vnlesse it be extraordinarily by some speciall reuelation, and singular priuiledge. Many also there are, which would not haue this doctrine publickly taught by the Minister; but without good reason. For first, as the Minister must not search the secrets of God which are not reuealed, so he must not suppresse or hide that which is reuealed. For things Reuealed, belong to 
               Deu. 29. 29. 
               vs and to our children for euer, as Moses teacheth.



Therefore as we may not search into those things which God will haue kept secret, so we may in no wise be wholly ignorant of those things which he hath reuealed vnto vs. But this doctrine of Predestination, is very plentifully and perspicuously reuealed and deliuered vnto vs in the Scriptures. Secondly, as the word of God omitteth nothing which is needefull to be knowne, touching the saluation of our soules, so wee must know, that it teacheth nothing but that which is profitable, and worthy to be learned of all. For that speach of Paul to the Romanes is true of all the writings of the Prophets and Apostles also, VVhatsoeuer things were written, were written for 
               Rom. 15. 4 
               our learning. But the word of God doth teach this doctrine of Election and Reiection, as is euident by many places therein: therefore it is necessary and fit to be taught of the Minister, and to be learned of the people. Thirdly, it is the duetie of all faithfull Ministers to teach all the counsell of God, as Paul sayth Act. 20. 27. hee did: but Predestination is a part



of Gods counsell: therefore it ought to bee deliuered of vs vnto the people of God; alwayes remembring, that wee applie our selues to your capacities, and teach it orderly (as occasion serueth) keeping our selues in all sobrietie within the limits of the Word. Fourthly, Christ commaundeth the Gospell to be preached Mark. 10. 15. to euery creature: but this Doctrine belongeth to the Gospell, and therefore is to bee preached vnto the vnlearned, as to the learned. Lastly, all Ministers are bound to keepe back nothing which is profitable, but to shew Act. 20 20. it as Paul did: But the doctrine of Predestination is very profitable. For first, it letteth vs see the omnisciencie, the omnipotencie, the soueraignetie, and immutable nature of God. Secondly, it serueth to increase and confirme our faith and hope, concerning the eternall felicitie of our soules and bodyes; seeing it is not founded vpon our selues, or vpon any sandie foundation, but vpon the constant and vnchangeable good pleasure of God. Thirdly, it teacheth vs not to wonder at



the small number of beleeuers, and at the hardnesse and blindnesse of many mens hearts and minds. For it sheweth, that God hath elected but a fewe, and hath Math. 20. 16. passed by many, leauing them vnto themselues, and deliuering them vp into the hands of the Diuell. Fourthly, it serueth to strengthen and comfort vs in all afflictions, and to arme vs against all the fiery darts of the Diuell, and the fury of his lims. For it sheweth, that nothing can separate vs frō the loue of God, and that all things Rom. 8. 28, 39. worke for the best vnto them that loue God, euen vnto them that are called of his purpose. All stormes and waues of woe shall passe ouer, and in the end we shall rest in the quiet hauen of euerlasting happinesse. Fiftly, this doctrine stayeth vs from taking offence at the Apostacy of many professors: for it sheweth vs, that all is not gold which glisters, and that some stand for a time, and some stand fast for euer. If they had been of vs (sayth Iohn) they should haue continued with vs. Sixtly, it teacheth 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . Iohn 2. 19. vs to acknowledge Gods singular goodnesse towards vs, who of his meere



good will toward vs, hath elected vs vnto eternall life, and the fruition of immortall glory in the heauens. Seuenthly, it serueth to teach vs humility, and to beate downe the pride of our harts. For it sheweth, that Gods grace, and not our goodnesse, is the originary cause of our welfare and saluation. The cause, which mooued God to choose vs rather then many others, was not our foreseene preparations, or meritoriou
                  •
                works, but his owne loue, and free good will toward vs. Lastly, (to 
                  〈◊〉
                sundry vses which might be made of this one doctrine) it teacheth vs to ascribe the glory of our saluation to God alone, and to walke thankefully before him, manifesting the gratitude of our hearts by our religious, righteous, and sober liues. To conclude, some are so far out of loue with this doctrine, that they can scarce with patience indure to heare it spoken of. And many licencious and prophane persons do very wickedly abuse it, to take vnto themselues liberty of lasci
                  〈◊〉
               us and loose 
                  〈◊〉
               . For (say they) if I be ordeyned to 
                  〈◊〉
               ed, I cannot be damned, 
                  〈◊〉
               


               
if damnation be my destiny, I can neuer be saued: And therefore it skilleth not how I liue; for if God haue appointed me to be saued, I shall be saued, though I do iust nothing: and it he haue determined that I shall be damned, I shall neuer escape it, though I liue neuer so well. For Gods decree is constant, his appointment shall stand, whosoeuer sayth nay to it. But these men forget, that God doth predestinate men as well to vse the meanes, as to atteine vnto the end. As he hath appointed a man to liue, so he hath appoynted the same man to vse those meanes which preserue life, as meate, drinke, rest, recreation, labour, phisicke. Euen so, as hee hath appoynted a man to be saued, hee hath appoynted him to vse the meanes, and to walke in the way of saluation, as to bele

                them. And in his Epistle to the



Ephesians he teacheth, that (as God hath chosen vs vnto life eternall, so) he hath Ephes. 1. 4. also chosen vs in Christ, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in loue: and that as hee hath ordeyned vs vnto saluation, so hee hath created vs in Christ 
               Ephes.

               Iesus vnto good works, which hee hath ordeined that wee should walke in them. As the Scripture teacheth vs that God hath elected vs vnto saluation: so it doth also teach vs, that hee sent his Sonne to saue vs. As God had determined that Christ should not dye in his infancie (as the euent declared) so hee did appoynt his father in lawe Ioseph to take hym and his Mother, and to flye into Egypt, when Herod 
               Math. 2. 13. sought to destroy him. By which wee see, that as GOD hath predestined the end, so hee hath also predestined the way and meanes thereunto. Hee therefore that desireth to be saued, must vse the meanes which God hath appointed. His damnation may not without cause be feared, who following the sway of his carnall affections, contemneth o

walke in the way which leadeth vnto glory. But wee (Beloued) reiecting all the fansies and fantastike inuentions of man, must rectifie our iudgements by the rule of Gods word, and with discreet diligence and sobrietie we ought to labour for the true knowledge and right vnderstanding of this celestiall and solacious doctrine of Gods eternall Predestination; 
                  〈◊〉
                doctrine not so profound as profitable, and not so 
                  •
               bstruse and intricate, as many doe imagine. A notable furtherance hereunto this treatise following will affoord; penned pithily, concisely, and perspicuously by a very learned and iudicious Diuine. Now (my Brethren) amōgst many other things which belong to this doctrine, there be two things which I do commend to your Christian consideration. First, the priuiledges of Gods elect and adopted children. Secondly, the notes of Election vnto saluation, and the practise of those things, whereby a man may come to be in his conscience soundly perswaded, that he is a chosen vessell predestinated to eternall life. For the first; Many and excellent



are the prerogatiues and immunities, wherewith the Elect are priuiledged and adorned: therefore the Psalmist saith, Glorious things are spoken of thee, O thou Citie of 
               Psal, 8

               God. And yet as glorious and numerous as they be, they are not easily discerned and acknowledged of the world: first, because their disgrace is common and publique, by reason of the spitefull and inueterate malice of the Serpent and his 
                  •
               eed, whereby it commeth to passe, that the faithfull in all ages haue acted a part longer or shorter, in a dolefull tragedy vpon the stage of the world, so as that of all men they haue alway for the most part seemed most miserable, and least respected of man, and priuiledged of God. Secondly, because sundry slips and sinnes haue bin obserued in them. Thirdly, the vpright Pro

                  . 27. man is such an abomination to the wicked, as that through his cankered spite, his spitefull and rancorous hatred, he cannot behold and fansie his sweet and louely condition. Fourthly, the principall ornaments of the Godly are darke and spirituall, as the Psalmist saith, The Kings daughter 
               Psal. 45.

                   all glorious within; and their outward estate is vsually obscure, course, and ragged; not much vnlike to the Curtaines of the Tabernacle, whose outwarde couerings were of Goates haire, Rams skins, and Badgers, but the inward were of fine twined linnen, blue silke, purple & skarlet, with the most exquisite embroydering of Exod. 26 the Cherubins vpon them.
            The World, vnto Gods Children is as a Step-mother, and may be tearmed Gods Schoole-house, in which hee trayneth vp his Children as Schollers vnder the crosse, often correcting them with his rod of affliction. Whence it is, that the world accounts them infortunate, and beeing vnable to iudge of colours, through the dimnesse of her sight, thee considereth and commendeth none but such as are light, though they weare and lose their brightnesse, whiles shee is poaring on them. But although the World bee blea

               sighted, yet those which are elected out of the world, do feele, and see, and can say much. And the word of God conteyneth



in it many royall and notable priuiledges and dignities, properly belonging vnto those whom God hath elected and adopted, some whereof I will briefly and plainely heere set downe.
            The first dignitie is their glorious and Priuil. 1. honorable stiles and titles. They are called in the Scriptures, The people, the redeemed, the sonnes, the building, the husbandrie and houshold seruants of God, the brethren, the spouse, the members, the seed & the sheep of Christ, the temples of the holy Ghost, the seed, the sonnes and the daughters of Abraham. They are called liuely stones, a spirituall house, heires of the promise, Saints, faithfull, Kings, Priests, yea an holy & princely priesthood, a peculiar people chalenged of God, a chosen generation, and an holy nation.
            The faithfull and chosen children of Priuil. 2. God alone haue true title to all the outward blessings of God, for they only beleeue, Isa. 1. 19 1. Tim. 4. 3. and they are only Gods obedientiaries. Reprobates are butindeed vsurpers of them in his sight. We lost them in Adam, and we receiue right neither in them



nor to them, but by Christ. His passions haue purchased our possessions.
            The Elect only can vse Gods blessings Priuil. 3. to a right end and in a right maner. For they only are pure (being purged in the bloud of Christ) and they only can pray with a true faith. The wicked make their riches their owne ruine, and Gods benefits their owne bane, and either abuse them, or vse them not as he commandeth them, and causeth his owne children by his grace to vse them.
            God hath appoynted his holy Angels, Priuil. 4. which for their strength and fortitude are called Gods, to guard and protect his Psa. 8. 5. people. The Angell of

makes a man to keepe the golden rule of mediocritie, is giuen onely to Gods Elect. For how can the Reprobate, who doe loue sinne, and doe not loue God, how (I say) can they feare to displease him, because they hate sinne, and loue him? or how can the Reprobate, who are all ordeined to ineuitable and eternall perdition, be sayd to feare God as a Sonne feareth his louing Father, seeing they be slaues, and considering that the word of God pronounceth him happy and blessed, who standeth Psa. 112

But wee shall say that those are blessed, whom the Lord hath accursed, if we shall say, that the Reprobate doe feare God with that feare whereof I now speake. Priuil. 14.

            GOD accounteth those iniuries as done vnto himselfe, which the wicked offer vnto his faithfull seruants. Saul persecuted the true professors of Christ, yet Christ told him from heauen, that



he persecuted him. The afflictions of Gods children, are called in the Scriptures, Col. 1. 24 Christs afflictions. For such is the vnion and communion betwixt the head and the members, that if any of Reuel. 11 8. them smart, the head is partaker of the griefe. If any part be crazed or annoyed, the heart is ready to mourne, the head to consult, the tongue to bewayle and vtter it, the foot to run to the Surgeon, and the hand is ready to do her duety. Euen so it is betweene Christ and his members. If any of them bee iniuriously vexed and troubled, hee takes the wrong as done vnto himselfe. And so Christ may be sayd to be crucified in that great city, which is mystically called Sodom and Babylon, that is, Rome, because hee is there put to death in his members, and is in them (as it were) slayne continually by Romish authority is either heathenish, or Popish, Christ died by the former, but in hi

esteemeth of those good deeds which men do vnto them, as done vnto himselfe: euen so hee accounteth the bare neglecting, and the not relieuing of them in their wants, as if the wicked had been in this kind of duety faultie vnto himselfe.
            God will shorten the World, and hasten the comming of his Sonne for the Priui. 15 Elect. And so that speach of Christ may be vnderstood, For the Elects sake those 
               Math. 24 22. 
               euill dayes shall be shortened. Moreouer, such is the patience and good wil of God vnto his Elect, as that hee stayeth his comming for a time, because he would (as Peter affirmeth) haue none of them to perish, but come vnto repentance, 2. Pet. 3. 9. that when hee commeth, they may bee welcome vnto him, and hee to them.
            God doth effectually call the Elect, and none besides them, and they alone Priui. 16 are iustifyed in his sight. For hee doth pardon them alone, and they only are Rom. 8. 30. clothed with the spotlesse roabes of Christs perfect righteousnes. Therefore the Prophet saith, The ch

               iustifie many. He bare the sinne of many. He doth not say all. For he came to saue his owne people only from their sinnes. He did not so much as pray for the Reprobate. Now this is a very great and admirable priuiledge, and honour, that God should send his only Sonne to dye for vs few despicable wretches, and that Christ should lose his life, and shead his heart blood for vs only, whereas it was in Act, 20. 28. it selfe (being the blood of God) sufficiēt to haue redeemed a thousand thousand worlds of sinners. If a man had a medicine able to cure all diseases, and would not giue it any sauing some few, they were wonderfully indebted to him. The blood of Christ is able to heale all our soule-sicknesses, and to deliuer vs from all our sinnes: and it hath pleased him to wash vs alone in it, and to withhold it from the far greater part of mankind. By which we see, how highly hee



hath honoured vs, and how deep we are in his debt. If three men were in danger of drowning or burning, and a man should come and deliuer one of them, and leaue the other two to the danger, all men might well say, that he fauoured him more then the other. By our sinnes we were all in danger to be drowned in that sulphury lake, and to be consumed with the fire of Gods wrath, as well as the Reprobates. Our sinnes deserue it. But Christ hath set himselfe betweene his Father and vs. He hath taken no notice (as it were) of them: and vs only, who are elected, he hath redeemed. As the Lord drowned the Egyptians onely in the Sea, so Christ hath ouerwhelmed our sinnes only in his blood. And as the Propitiatory couered the Ar

               e and the Decalogue: so Christ couereth his Elect with his bloud, and hideth them, yea them alone, from the wrath of God, and therefore Paul calleth him, The sauiour of his body. By which we see, his grace & good Ephes. 5. 23. will is farre greater to vs then to them.

                   Luk. 1. 74. haue liberty to serue and worship GOD without feare of any euill. They serue him chiefly for his loue, and for conscience of his commandements. The wicked seeme to serue him oftentimes, but it is for some sinester respect, as for feare of damnation (as the slaue obeyeth his Master for feare of the whip) or for feare of imprisonment, or an ill name, or else for the loue of lucre, or the desire of glory or credit with men.
            The elect alone do merit at Gods hāds, Priuil. 19. for they being alone partakers of Christs meritorious righteousnes, do also alone, it being accounted as their owne, merit euerlasting life of God. Now is not this an exceeding great fauour, that we being but wormes, should deserue euerlasting Iob. 25. 6 happines of so high a Maiesty? It doth greatly commend the loue of God to vs, and the rather, because he hath graced



vs only with the inestimable merits of his Sonne, refusing to impart them to many millions of men, as noble, as wise, as learned, as beautifull, as mighty, and as wealthy as our selues.
            The Elect being once effectually called, do sinne thenceforward only of infirmity. Priui. 20 Therefore Saint Iohn sayth, that Whosoeuer is borne of God, sinneth not, that is, with full consent of will. For so farfoorth 1. Iob. 3. 9. as he is regenerate, he doth not sinne.

Whereas the faithfull detest and abhor their corruptions, and struggle against them, striuing and desiring to be deliuered of them, as a prisoner of his bolts, or as those which are troubled with the disease Ineubus, called the Night-mare, desire or struggle to be rid thereof.

            The Elect being once forgiuen of God, & accepted vnto euerlasting life for the merits of Christ, haue ioy vnspeakeable, and that peace which passeth all vnderstanding. The kingdome of God (sayth the Rom. 14. 17. Apostle) standeth in peace and ioy in the holy Ghost. If the health of body be such a thing, as is rather with comfort inioyed, then in words to be expressed; how great shall we think is the peace of conscience, & ioy in the holy Ghost? It may be tasted, but it can not be expressed. The malefactor hath great peace and quietnes with himselfe, whē the King hath granted him his pardon: euen so the elect should haue Rom. 5. 7. great peace & tranquility of mind, when as God, the great King of heauen and earth, hath pardoned their sins, and receiued thē to fauour. But on the cōtrary, the Reprobate & irreconciliable sinners, that sell themselues to worke wickednes, and drinke iniquitie lyke water,



haue either no peace at all, but are like the raging Sea that cannot rest, whose Isa. 57. 20. waters cast vp myre and dirt, or else are senselesse like stocks, labouring of a spirituall apoplexy, and a diuelish dead palsy, being sunke into the gulfe of security, and hauing made a league with death and a couenant with hell.
            The Elect haue an Altar, whereupon Priuil. 23 if they lay all their prescribed sacrifices, they shall be accepted of God, as smelling sweetly in his nostrils. But the Reprobate, and all their sacrifices are odious and abominable in his sight. They want our Altar Christ Iesus, who should purge and sanctify theyr offerings, and by whom they should offer them vnto the Father: and therefore their goodly sacrifices are but goodly sinnes.
            God giueth his holy Spirit to his Elect only, who in Gods appointed time maketh Priuil. 24 his habitation in them, who doth also sweep the floores of their spirits with the hand of his grace, and the beesome of his word, and trimmeth vp the houses of their hearts with the sweet and pleasant



flowres of his spirit, and adorneth them with the costly tapestry and precious ornaments of his orient and excellent graces He perfumeth them (as it were) with frankincense and coales of Iuniper. He buildeth windowes within them, that they may receiue the bright and beawtifull beames and louely light, which do shine from the Sun of righteousnes. Hee constituteth a kingdome within them: hee ruleth them with the strength of his arme, and the scepter of his word. He stablisheth his throne with iustice and mercy: he fostereth the part regenerate, he bridleth and tameth the rebell, euen the rebellious corruption of the heart, and by little and little consumeth it. As for the Reprobate; their hearts are the dens of the Diuell, and the cabins of sinne, stincking loathsomly like a dead carryon. There is indeed a kingdome within them: but the Diuell is the King, Sinne is the Queene. His Throne is wickednes, his Scepter is iniquity, his Lawes are the liberty of the flesh, his rewards are death, and they



are his slaues and vassals.
            As the Elect may haue Grace, so it is possible for thē to grow in grace: therefore Priuil. 25. 2. Pet. 3. 18. 1. Pet. 2. 2. 
               Peter exhorteth vs, To grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Christ, and sheweth also how we may grow. But for the Reprobate; as they are void of all true lauing grace, so they grow not there in, for they can not increase in that which they want. A man cannot grow in bignes, vnlesse he haue a body. A man cā not grow rich, vnlesse he haue 
                  •
               iches. They may increase in sin and grow in wickednes, as clay doth in hardnes whē the weather is dry, or as the riuers do in depth & bredth whē the tide commeth. Againe, whereas the Lord doth very often giue the reines to the Reprobate, and suffers them to rush headlong into horrible enormities, as the Gadarens Swine did into the Sea; hee doth mercifully preserue his owne people, and graciously keepeth them oftentimes from declining and falling; and whensoeuer they either stumble or fall, they may recouer themselues by serious and sound repentance. But God hath



not vouchsafed the gift of godly sorow and true repentance to the Reprobate. It belongs only to Gods Elect. Wee may reade of Dauids repentance, of Peters falling and rising, of Pauls conuersion: but wee neuer read of any true 
                  
                     •
                  o turne truly, is to returne from all sinne vnto God. turning that euer any reprobate made. If any of them repent, it is but for fashion sake, or for feare of punishment. It is not for loue to God, or for the hatred of sinne for sinne, or for the consideration of Gods loue vnto them. As lead being cast into the water, can not but sinke, so the Reprobate can not but sinne. And as a Mill-stone lying in the bottome of the Sea, can not come vp, so the Reprobate beeing ouerwhelmed in the bottomlesse pit of iniquitie, can not repent. Though it were possible to remoue a Mountayne out of his place, yet it were more impossible to remoue a Reprobate from his corruptions. Hee may mooue, but hee will not remooue. Hee may turne, but hee cannot returne. As it is impossible for him to reuiue, who is ordained



to perpetuall death: so it is impossible for him to reuiue from sinne, whom the fountaine of all life hath righteously forsaken, and deliuered for euer vnto Sathan, to hold captiue in the graue of sinne, and in the darke and deadly dungeon of iniquity.
            The children of God haue the spirit of prayer, and with boldnesse may approach Priuil. 26. vnto the throne of his grace, and put vp their suites vnto him. The King will permit a true subiect to come into his presence and speake vnto him, when a rebell or traytour shall finde no such fauour. A Kings sonne may speake vnto his father, when others are not permitted so to do. We are the sonnes of God, and the seruants of his sonne; therefore we may boldly in the name of our elder brother, present our selues before him, and put vp our supplications to him; and the rather, because he knoweth and approoueth vs. For as the Apostle sayth, The foundation of God remaineth sure, and hath this seale, The Lord knoweth who are 
               2. Tim. 2 19. 
               his. But the Reprobate and their prayers



are abominable in his sight. They want the spirit of prayer, and either can not pray at all, or not in the right manner. Neither can they approach with boldnesse vnto GOD, seeing they haue no part in Christ, nor Christ in them. They cannot pray with cōfidence to be heard; seeing they are destitute as well of faith, as of the fauour of God.
            GOD accepteth the sincere will and Priuil. 27. feruent desires of his faithfull and elect children to beleeue, repent and obey for faith, repentance & obedience. For As 
               Psa. 103 13. 
               a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him. He will spare them, as a man 
               Mala. 3. 17. 
               spareth his owne sonne. But fathers vse to take in good part their childrens works, so they do them with care and diligence, though not so perfectly and exactly as indeed were meet. In like manner, if we will and with an honest heart desire to do well, though we do it very weakely, God doth notwithstanding take all in good part, and regardeth not the imperfection of the worke. A desire of grace



is one degree of grace, and a will to do well, is with God accounted doing well. Therefore Paul sayth, If there be a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man 
               2. Cor. 8. 12. 
               hath, and not according to that he hath not. That which he saith of giuing almes, is true in the performance of all other duties. If there be in a man a ready and willing mind to beleeue, repent, and obey, though he do not these things perfitly, or so well as many of his brethren do; yet God, for the merits and intercession of his Sonne, accepteth both of him and his imperfit works, and in mercy rewardeth him. Dauid, besides his dayly infirmities, did thrice grieuously offend God, and yet he told Salomon, that if he 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . Chron. 7. 17. would walke before him as Dauid his father, he would establish the throne of his kingdome, so as that he should not want a man to be a Ruler in Israel. And albeit in that place he requireth that he should do according to all his commandements, whereby he may seeme to exact perfect (and therefore impossible) obedience; yet if we consider all things



well, it will plainely appeare, that hee meaneth no other thing, then that hee should labour and seeke to please him in all things: because hee setteth his father Dauid before his eyes as a patterne to follow, and because else-where we reade that hee maketh the same promise vnto him, onely requiring of him, To indeuour himselfe to doe hi
                     •
                   commandements, 
               2 Chron. 28. 7. as hee had begun. Now this is a very comfortable doctrine. For when a man considereth that GOD respects his weake obedience and honest heart, and accounteth the will to doe, for the deed done, his heart is eased, his conscience is appeased, his mind is setled, and beholding the infinite loue of God, he is rauished with ioy, and prouoked to magnifie his mercy, and to struggle against the corruption of his heart, to please him in doing all things which are pleasing in his sight. Now, lest we should beguile our selues (for mans heart is a mine of subtilty) in thinking we desire, & will to beleeue, repent & obey, whē as we either do not at al, or do but as



a reprobate may doe; I will set downe some rules, which as the touch-stone trieth gold, and as Salomons sword found out the right mother, so these may serue to discouer the truth of our desires, and to deserte the goodnes of our wils. First of all, if we be grieued that we can desire and will no better then we do: secondly, if we do desire and will to do these things for the glory of God, and because we are perswaded that both these things and the willing of them are pleasing vnto God: thirdly, if we striue to increase in willing and desiring, and if we feed

                them with the diligent hearing of Gods word, with holy meditations, with often prayers, and with setting before vs the ensamples of excellent men, as the Priests kept the fire vpon the altar, and fed it continually, and suffered it not to Leuit. 6. 12. go out: fourthly, if to our wills and desires we ioyne reformation of our liues, and in our seuerall callings labour accordingly to serue God: fiftly, if in our hearts we prefer eternall seruing of God in heauen, before all momentany profits



and pleasures whatsoeuer. Sixtly, if we had rather liue in a continuall crosse all our life long, but yet pleasing God, and being in his fauour, then spend the same in sinfull pleasures, continually displeasing his Maiesty. Seuenthly, if we desire and will to s

But when the weather is broken, when the holy Ghost begins to make a thawe, with the fresh fire of his grace, when the South wind blowes hard, and when the Sunne of righteousnes hath melted the ice, then Faith will appeare, and flow amayne, as a Riuer after rayne, and as the waters do after a thawe. Then grace, which was couered before, will shine bright and cleare, as the Sunne doth after a showre, as is euident by the repentance of Dauid and Peter. Moreouer, our Sauiour sayeth, that his sheepe shall Iohn 10. 28.

his arme, and carry them in his bosome. Hee Psal. 23. 2. maketh them to rest in greene pastures, and leadeth them by the still waters. Psa. 41 12. He vpholdeth them in their integrity, and doth set them before his face for euer. As Zach. 4. 9. 
               Zerubbabel layed the foundation of the Temple, and did finish it: so Phil. 1. 6. God that hath begun his good worke in the temple of our hearts, will finish it vnto the end. They can not be taken from him by strong hand. Iohn 10 29, 30. For hee is greater then all, and his will to saue them is answerable to his power: therefore hee sayth, Iohn 10 28.

            The Elect may assuredly be perswaded in this life, that they shall be saued in the life to come. For a speciall and certaine perswasion of Gods mercy, is the very heart and marow, the life and soule of true faith. Therefore Paul sayth, We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be destroyed, we haue a building of God, that is, an house not made with hands, eternall in the heauens. Furthermore, if it be not possible for men to know that they shal be saued, how could Saint Iohn say, These things haue I written vnto you that beleeue in the name of the Sonne of God, that ye may know that ye haue eternall life. To conclude, if it were impossible for a man to be in his conscience assured, that hee is the elect and faithfull seruant of God, effectually called

               except ye be reprobates? And wherefore should Peter bid vs be diligent to make our calling & election sure? It remaineth therfore as an vndoubted truth, that the elect may be truly assured of their election, and may assuredly know (without speciall reuelation) that they shall be saued. Now this is a very great prerogatiue, and the greater; first, because it may be iuioyed to the end: secondly, because the longer it is inioyed, the better we are assured: thirdly, it brings with it wōderfull ioy. For what greater ioy can a man here inioy, then to be assured of eternall ioy?



Fourthly, this assurāce makes a mā mor

                wāt this knowledge altogether, can haue no solid consolation. And as for the Reprobate; they haue no more to do with this certenty, then they haue with saluation. As it is impossible for them to be saued, so it is impossible for thē to be truly assured of their saluation. He that dreameth, may think he walketh, eateth, talketh, seeth, whē he doth not: and he may think he is awake, whē he is not. So these dreamers may think that they shalbe saued, and may sooth vp themselues as if they were cock-sure, but they are deceiued. He that is in a swoone, doth sometimes perswade himself that he seeth many strange sights, but his perswasion is false: so the Reprobates may thinke all things runne round, they may perswade themselues they are in Gods fauour and shall be saued: but as the things are false whereof they do perswade themselues:

The Elect shall be placed on his right hand, and vpon them he Math. 25 will pronounce the white and comfortable sentence of absolution. On the contrary, he will raise vp the Reprobate, as he is a terrible and dreadfull Iudge, he will set them on his left hand like Goates, and pronounce against them the dolefull and black sentence of condemnation. And more also, which may increase their griefe; he will vse the Elect for the approbation of his iudgement vpon them, and vpon the wicked Angels also. They shall attend vpon him, as Iustices do vpō the Iudge at the Assises, and shall approoue his sentence; and this Saint Paul teacheth, when as he 1. Cor. 6. 2, 3.


               
sayth, that the Saints shall iudge the world and the wicked Angels. Now as this is a great honour vnto the Elect, to sit as Iudges vpon the wicked: so it must needes minister no small griefe vnto them, to be (as it were) iudged of those whome they before haue derided, condemned, nicknamed, and persecuted. Thus we haue seene many notable priuiledges of Gods elect and faithfull children. If Balaam prophecied of the Israelites, when he looked vpon them dwelling according to their tribes, saying, How goodly are thy tents, O Iacob, and thy

            The last priuiledge of the Elect, whereof Priuil. 32. I will intreate, is, that God will giue them the kingdome of heauen and euerlasting life. Feare not, little flock (sayth Luk 12. 32.

Our Sauiour saith, that he giueth eternall life vnto all his Sheep. As Ioshua brought the children of Israel into earthly Canaan: so Christ Iesus our Ioshua, will one day bring all true Israelites into celestiall Canaan, & will crowne thē with immortall glory.

Their toungs shall continually sound out the prayses of God. They shal celebrate an euerlasting Isa. 66. 23. Phil. 3. 21. Sabboth, seruing God most purely for euer and euer.

When a man hath liued so many thousand thousand yeres in all y• pleasures of paradise, as there are hours in a M. millions of yeres,



he shall not atteine vnto the end, for the end is endlesse, and the time is without time. But on the other side, the Reprobate are seuered from the solacious sight and comfortable presence of God. Their fellowship is with the Diuell and his angels in

When they haue spent so many yeeres in paynes, as there be stars in the Skye, moats in the Sunne, sands on the shoare, and fishes in the seas, they shall be as farre from the end, as they were the first day: for the time is infinite, their damnation is euerlasting, & their death shall neuer be put to death: their worme shall not dye, their fire shall neuer be Isa. 66. 24. put out, neither shall they be put out with it.

                then (Beloued) you see the



Charter of the Saints in part. No earthly Monarch can graunt such a one vnto his Subiects, as God hath giuen freely to his Elect. All the Countries, Kingdomes, and Cities that haue beene, are, and shall be, can not shew such dignities, such royalties, and such immunities giuen them by man, as I haue shewed to belong to Gods Elect, and obedient children. The consideration of these benefits and priuiledges should mooue vs, First, to acknowledge and lawd Gods infinite loue. Secondly, in way of thankefulnes to dedicate our soules and bodyes, and all that we haue, vnto GOD. Thirdly, to admire the condition of Gods children. Fourthly, to be afrayd to disgrace them, whom the Lord doth so grace and countenance. Fiftly, to vndergoe couragiously all aduerse blasts, and all the crosses of this life. Sixtly, to alienate our hearts from the world. Seuenthly, to roll our care vpon God, and to rely vpō his prouidence. Eightly, to desire the comming of Christ, and not to feare death too múch: The sooner



we dye, the sooner we come to our crownes. Lastly, the cōsideration of these benefits and priuiledges, should stir vs vp to seeke by all meanes to be enrolled amongst them, and neuer to rest, till we be in some measure certaine, & certainly perswaded, that we are elected, and preordained to saluation. Whē 
               Ahashuerosh had honoured Mordecai, and shewed fauour vnto the Iewes, the Scripture sayth Hest. 8. 7 that much people of the land became Iewes. So, seeing the Lord hath thus dignified the Elect, let vs behaue our selues like them, and labour to be accounted of their company. Claudius Lysias gaue a great summe of money for the freedome Act. 22. 28. of the Romanes; how much more ought we to seeke for these freedomes and royalties, which do more surpasse the other, then the heauen doth the earth, and the precious pearle doth the poorest pibble. They are not indeed to be named, or compared together, and yet these may be had without money, though they can not be had by money. And thus much for the Priuiledges.
            
               
I come now briefly to set downe the notes of Election vnto life, and to shew how a man may come to be truly perswaded in his conscience, that he shall be saued. Let a man that would attaine to the knowledge of his election vnto saluation, 1. heare the word of God often and attentiuely. For faith, whereby wee Rom. 10. 17. are perswaded of Gods speciall grace vnto vs, is ordinarily wrought by hearing of the word preached. 2. Let him wage warre with his infidelity, and let him not listen to Sathan tempting him to doubting, or desperation. 3. Let him beware of pride and presumption, neither trusting to his owne goodnes, nor obliuious of Gods infinite iustice. 4. Let him often and earnestly pray for this benefit, and desire that GOD would giue him his Spirit, which may witnes with him that hee is the chosen childe of God. 5. Let him reuerently receiue the Sacrament, and meditate often of his Baptisme. For the Sacraments are pledges of Gods loue, and serue to increase our faith. Hee that receiueth



them with an honest and humble heart, may assure himselfe of the remission of his sinnes, and of the saluation of his soule. Lastly, let him expend and duly 6. Consider diligently Gods

Psalme asketh the Lord who shall dwell in his tabernacle, and rest on his holy mountaine? and receiued answere as it were by oracle frō God, that he shall, who walks vprightly, and worketh righteousnes, and speaketh the truth frō his heart. And Peter hauing cōmanded vs to make our election and calling sure, addeth, saying, that if we do These things, wee shall neuer fall, but shall be sure and certaine. Now 2. Pet. 1. 10. what these things are, he sheweth, to wit, that we adorne our hearts and liues with 2. Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7.


               
vertue, knowledge, tēperance, godlines, & loue. To cōclude, he that is sure of his Adoption, may be also certaine of his Election: for none are adopted, but such as are elected. Now a man may know his Adoption, if he find in himselfe the properties of an obediēt & louing son. I will set downe some. 1. Property. As a little child, whether in learning good, or leauing euill, is either woon by a faire word, or awed by a check, or feared by a frowning looke, or allured by a trifling gift, or stilled by seeing an other beatē before him, or else quieted by a rod; euē so Gods childrē are either affected by his promises, or allured by his mercies, or awed by his threats, or skared by his frowning coūtenāce, or humbled by his correcting of others, or by his rod which is vpō their owne backs. 2. A good and wise child is very desirous to know his fathers minde or will, that so he may best know how to please & humour him; and such is ye
                disposition of Gods child. Iob maketh it the note of a wicked mā, to affect y•
                ignorāce Iob. 21. 14. of Gods waies. 3. A good child knowing



that he hath vniustly grieued his father, will not be quiet till they be good friends againe. 4. He laboureth to resemble his father in his rare and excellent vertues. 5. Hee will beare a blow at his fathers hands, (though he skorne to put it vp at an other mans,) and whē his father hath chidden or corrected him, he will not run for comfort to his fathers desperate & sworne enemies. 6.

               THE doctrine of Predestination and Gods Grace is to be founded vpon the Written Word of God, and not vpon the iudgements of men. For as Hilarie sayth well, God cannot be vnderstood but by God: And De Tri

                  . lib. 5. againe, Wee must learne of God, what wee are to vnderstand of God, because he is the only author of our knowledge of him. It is also requisite that this Doctrine agree with the grounds of common reason, and of that knowledge of God which may be obtained by the light of nature; and such are these which follow.

both heare him that saith, O man! Verily, if we be therefore mooued because we are men, the Apostle speaketh to humane nature it self being weake and feeble, saying; O man! Who art thou which pleadest against GOD? Rom. 9. 20. Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? If a beast could speake and did say to God, Why hast thou made him a man, and me a beast? mightest thou not iustly be angry, and say, O beast, who art thou? and thou art a man, but in comparison of God, thou art a beast.

that it should come to passe.

For I do willingly acknowledge and teach vniuersall redemption and grace, so farre as it is possible by the word. My mind is to pursue after peace, which is departing from vs: and I would

And I hope, I shall sufficiently perswade an indifferent iudge, that these things haue not beene lately hatched at home, which wee deliuer in our Congregations and Schooles, but that we haue also deriued and fetched them from the Fathers themselues.

            THE ORDER OF PREDESTINATION, as it is collected out of the Scriptures by the Author.
            
            
               PRedestination is the counsell of God touching the last end or estate of man out of this temporall or natural life. For as touching 1. Co
                     •
                  . 15. 46 natural life we are all alike: and this kind of life is in the counsell of God onely a preparation and step vnto the spirituall and heauenly life. The supreme end of predestination is the manifestation of Gods glorie, partly in his mercie, and partly in his iustice. And this hath bin the doctrin of the Fathers. S. Austen saith, that one of those two societies

               of men, which wee mystically call two cities, is that which is predestinated to raigne eternally with God: and the other to suffer eternall punishment with the diuell. Fulgentius saith also, That in Gods predestination there 
               Ad Monymum. lib. 1. 
               is prepared either a mercifull remission of sins, or a iust punishing. And Gregorie saith, That God being a iust Creator vnto all after 
               Comment. in 1. Reg. Cap. 4. 
               an admirable manner, hath foreelected some, and forsaken others in their corruptions. And the more learned Schoolemen vse to say, that God for the more full manifestation of his perfection hath predestinated some in manifesting his goodnes by the rule of mercie, and damned others, in representing his perfection by the rule of iustice.
            The common meanes of accomplishing this counsell is two-fold; the creation, and the permission of the fall. Creation, is that by which God made ye whole man of nothing according to his owne image; but yet changeable, and endued with a naturall life. The permission of the fall is, whereby God did iustly suffer Adam and his posteritie to fall away, in that he did not hinder them when he was able; as being indeed bound to none to hinder.



And God is said not to hinder euill, when he ceaseth after a sort from his operation, not illuminating the minde, and not inclining the will to obey his voyce. This permission of the euill of fault is by Gods foreknowledge and will, but yet only for the greater good of all: which would bee hindred if God did not suffer euill. For if there were not sinne, there should bee no place for the patience of Martyrs, and for the sacrifice of Christ offered vpon the crosse, which doth infinitely exceede all the sinne of the whole world. Augustine saith well: God hath iudged it better to doe 
               Enchir. cap. 27. 
               good with euils, than to permit no euill to be. In like manner Gregorie saith: In his seuere 
               Expos. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . Reg. cap. 4. 
               iudgement he suffereth euill to be done, but withall he doth in mercie forecast, what good things he may bring to passe, by these euils, which hee doth ordaine by his iudgement. For what greater sinne is there than that by which we doe all die? and what greater goodnesse than that by which we are deliuered from death? And doubtlesse but that Adam sinned, our Redeemer should not haue taken our flesh vpon him—. Whiles God was to be borne man, the Almightie did foresee



that hee would make of that euill, for which they were to die, a good which should be greater than that euill. The greatnesse of which good what faithfull man is there who doth not see how wonderfully it doth excell? Surely great are the euils, which we suffer by the desert of the first fault: but what faithfull man would not rather endure worse, than to be without so great a Redeemer? And in this respect elsewhere he calleth the fall of Adam, foelicem culpam, a happie fault. That In benedict. Cerci Pasc. which I haue said of the permission of the fall, I doe also say of the fall permitted; sauing that the permission is a meanes of the decree by it selfe, but the fall is a meanes (of accomplishing the decree) onely by the ordination of God, who draweth good out of euill.
            This fall permitted commeth not to passe but God being willing, neither doth it come to passe contrariwise or otherwise than God permitteth, neither can it any further be than hee doth permit. Yet the will of God is not the cause of the fall, but the will of man left vnto it selfe by God, and moued by the suggestion of Sathan; which will appeare by this similitude:



I build a house subiect to change and falling, which notwithstāding would continue many yeeres, if it might bee free from the annoyance of windes: yea, if I would but vnderprop it, when the storme commeth, it would continue stable. But as soone as the windes begin to rage, I do not vnderprop it, and it is my will not to vnderprop it, because it is my pleasure so to doe, thereupon the house being weatherbeaten falleth downe. I see the fall, and in part I will it, because now when I could very easily haue hindred the fall, yet I would not. And although thus farre I doe will the fall, in so much as it is my will not to hinder it: yet the cause of the fall is not to be imputed vnto me, that did not vnderproppe it, but to the winds which cast it downe. So God leauing Adam vnto himselfe, that hee might be prooued by tentation, and that it might appeare what the creature is able to doe, the Creator ceasing for a time to helpe and guide, is not to bee accounted the cause of this fall. For he did not encline the minde to sinne, hee did not infuse any corruption, neither did he withdraw any gift, which



he did bestow in the creation: onely it pleased him to deny or not to conferre confirming grace. The proper cause of the fall was the diuell attempting our ouerthrow, and Adams will, which when it began to bee prooued by tentations, did not desire Gods assistance, but voluntarilie bent it selfe to fall away.
            Predestination hath two parts, the decree of election, and the decree of reprobation, So Isidore saith: There is a double predestination, either of the elect vnto rest, or of the reprobate vnto death: and both are 
               De summo bo. lib. 2. cap. 6. 
               done by God, that he might make the elect alwaies to follow after heauenly and spirituall things, and that he might suffer the reprobate, by for saking them, to bee delighted alwaies with earthly and outward things. And Angelome saith: Christ by his secret dispensation 
               Jn lib. 1. Reg. cap. 8. 
               hath out of an vnfaithfull people predestinated some to cuerlasting liberty, quickning them of his free mercie: and damned others in euerlasting death, in leauing them by his hidden iudgement in their wickednes.
            
            The decree of election is that whereby God hath ordained certaine men to his Eph. 1. 5. glorious grace in the obtaining of their



saluation and heauenly life by Christ.
            In the decree of election according These acts are vsually called the decree and the execution of the decree. to Gods determination there is (as wee conceiue) a double act. The former concernes the end, the latter concernes the meanes tending to the end. This the holy Ghost seemeth to me to haue taught very euidentlie, Rom. 9. 11. That the purpose which is according to election might remain. Heere wee see that Paul distinguisheth Gods eternall purpose and election, and placeth in his decree a certaine election in the first place before the purpose of damning or sauing. And in Rom. the 8. 29. 30. Those which he knew before, he also predestinated to bee made like to the image of his son—.Whom he predestinated, them also he called—.In which wordes Paul distinguisheth betwene the decree, and the execution thereof, which he maketh to bee in these three, Vocation, Iustification, and Glorification. Moreouer he distinguisheth the decree into two acts, foreknowledge, whereby hee doth acknowledge some men for his owne, before the rest: and predestination, whereby he hath determined from eternitie to make them



like vnto Christ. In like manner Peter teacheth, 1. Pet. 1. 2, where hee saith, that the faithful are elected according to the foreknowledg of God the father vnto sanctification of the spirit. If any man shall say that by foreknowledge in these places wee must vnderstand (as many would) the foreknowledge or foreseeing of future faith, he is manifestly deceiued. For whom God foreknew, them hee did predestinate that they should bee like to Christ, that is, that they should bee made iust, and the sonnes of God: for Paul addeth, Rom. 8. 29. That he might be the first borne among many brethren. But those, which are predestinated to be iust, and to be the sonnes of God, are also predestinated to beleeue, because Adoption and Righteousnes are receiued by faith. Now we cannot rightly say, that God doth first foreknow that men will beleeue, and afterwards predestinate thē to beleeue; because that God hath therfore foreknowne that those shall beleeue, whom hee did foreknow would beleeue, because hee did decree that they should beleeue. So Iustin Martyr calleth Cont. 
                     •
                  riph. those elect, who were foreknowne that they



should beleeue. And Lumbard: Whom hee

                     •
                  . scio. 
               hath foreknowne, them he hath predestinated, that is, by grace conferred hee hath prepared that they should beleeue the word preached. Moreouer the word (know) when it is giuen vnto God speaking of the creature, doth very often signifie to imbrace or approue. Psal. 1. 6. The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish. Matth. 7. 23. Depart from me yee workers of iniquitie, I neuer knew you. Furthermore, the prescience & purpose of God are by the holy Ghost put for one and the same thing. 2. Tim. 2. 19. The foundation of God remaineth sure—the Lord knoweth who are his: Rom. 11. 2. Those whom God foreknew are said to be elected according to the election of grace, vers. 5. And therefore the foreknowledge mentioned by Paul doth not signifie the foreknowledge of faith, or of any other vertue in those which were to bee elected. It is also the iudgement of Augustine, that predestination De perseu. sanct. lib. cap. 18. Rom. 11. 1. 2 is sometimes vnderstood by prescience, euen in the foresaid place. Hath God cast away his people which hee knew before? And he saith that, Those are sonnes in Gods



foreknowledge, whose names are written in their fathers register, so as they shall neuer be raised out. Cyrill saith also that Christ knoweth his sheepe, electing and foreseeing them 
               Expos. in Ioh. 7. cap. 6 
               vnto euerlasting life. As the Apostle saith Rom. 11. 12. God hath not cast away his people which hee knew before. For as the Lord is said not to know those, whom he doth reiect: as when he answered the foolish virgins saying, Matth. 25. 12. Verilie I say vnto you, I know you not: so hee is said to know those, whom he doth predestinate and fore-appoint vnto saluation. And Thomas expoundeth that place in the 8. to the Romanes after Idem Hugo de sanct. 
                     •
                  ict. in annot. in Rom. et Ioachim. in Reuel. par. 1. this sort: Whom he foreknew in his knowledge of approbation, these he hath also predestinated: And he will also haue an effectuall will of conferring grace to bee included in the knowledge of approbation.
            
            In the decree of election the first act is a purpose, or rather a part and beginning 1. Pet. 2. 9. People which God challengeth vnto himselfe 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . of the diuine purpose, whereby God doth take certaine men which are to be created vnto his euerlasting loue and fauour passing by the rest, and by taking maketh them vessels of mercie and honour: and this act is of the sole will of God, without



any respect either of good or euill in the creature. And God doth wrong none, although hee chuse not all; because hee is tied to none: & because he hath absolute soueraigntie and authoritie ouer all creatures. We that are but men giue leaue vnto men, especially vnto our friends, to do at their pleasure in many things as they themselues list, and to vse their owne discretions. The rich man is kinde to which poore person hee pleaseth; and of beggers he doth adopt one, and will not adopt another, and that without offring any iniurie. Now that libertie, which wee yeeld vnto man, must much more bee granted vnto God.
            The second act is the purpose of sauing or conferring glorie, whereby hee doth ordaine or set apart the very same men, which were to fall in Adam, vnto saluation and celestiall glorie. This act is in no wise to be seuered from the former, but to be distinguished in the minde (for orders sake and for the better vnfolding of it) for as by the former men were ordained vnto grace: so by this latter the meanes are subordained whereby grace may be conferred



and manifested: and therefore this latter maketh a way for the execution and accomplishing of the former. Moreouer, this act hath no impulsiue cause ouer and beside the good pleasure of God: and it is with regard to Christ the Mediatour, in whom all are elected to grace and saluation; and to dreame of any election out of him is against all sense: because hee is the foundation of election to bee executed, in regard of ye beginning, the meanes, and the end. Lastly, this act is not of men to bee created as was the former, but of men falne away. Therfore in this act God respecteth the corrupted masse of mankind.
            Furthermore in this second act there are fiue degrees, the ordaining of a Mediatour, the promising of him being ordained, the exhibiting of him being promised, the applying of him being exhibited, or to bee exhibited, and the accomplishment of the application. It is not vnlike which Bernard saith, The kingdome of 
               De verbis libri sapientiae. 
               God is granted, promised, manifested, perceiued. It is granted in predestination, promised in vocation, manifested in iustification, perceiued



or receiued in glorification.
            
            The ordaining of a Mediatour is that whereby the second person being the Sonne of God, is appointed from all eternitie to bee a Mediatour betweene God himselfe and men. And hence it is that Peter saith, that Christ was foreknowne before 
               1. Pet. 1. 20 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               the foundation of the world. And well saith Augustine, that Christ was predestinated to be our head. For howsoeuer as he is (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) the substantiall word of the Father, or the Sonne, he doth predestinate with the Father, and the holy Ghost; yet as hee is the Mediatour, hee is predestinated himselfe.
            The promising is that, whereby Christ being from eternitie ordained for the saluation and spirituall life of men, is reuealed and offred vnto them, together with grace to be obtained by him: this promise is vniuersall in respect of all and euery one that doe beleeue. Ioh. 3. 16. God so loued the world, that he hath giuen his 
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               onely begotten sonne, that euery one that beleeueth in him should not perish. Ioh. 6. 47. Hee that beleeueth in me hath life euerlasting. Matth. 11. 28. Come vnto me all yea



that are wearie and laden, and I will ease you. Mark. 16: 16. He that shall beleeue and bee baptised, shal be saued: but he that will not beleeue shall be damned. Act. 10. 43. That thorough his name all that beleeue in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes. Act. 13. 39. By him euery one that beleeueth, is iustified. Rom. 1. 16. The Gospell is the power of God to saluation to euery one that beleeueth. Rom. 10. 4. Christ is the end of the law for righteousnes vnto euery one that beleeueth. Gal. 3. 22. The Scripture hath concluded all vnder sin, that the promise by the faith of Iesus Christ should be giuen to them that beleeue.
            
            With the promise there is ioyned an exhortation, or commandement to beleeue: which is more generall than the promise; because the promise is made onely to beleeuers; but the commandement is giuen to beleeuers and vnbeleeuers also. For the elect are mingled with the wicked in the same assemblies: and therefore the Ministers of the Gospell ought indifferently to exhort all and euery one to repent, considering that they are altogether ignorant, who, and how many be elected, and be to be conuerted;



moreouer God by exhortations to repentance, meaneth to leaue those without excuse, whom he doth see will neuer repent. So Abbat Ioachim saith: It behooueth 
               In Reuel. p. 3. l. 2. 
               them to preach for the elects sake, and to declare vnto men the words of life, that their light may shine before men, and that they may fatten the hearts of the elect, by anoynting them with the oyle of spirituall doctrine: but for the reprobate, ligare aquam coelo, to 
                     〈◊〉
                   the water in the clowdes. And againe, Lest the reprobate should haue excuse, and for the 
               Part. 4. t. 7. 
               elect which are among them, the messenger himselfe shall bee sent, who doth not onely preach this in secret as it were for feare, but crieth also with a loude voyce, which may bee heard farre off, and of all men also. Some are wont to say, that Gods commandement by this meanes doth ouerthwart his decree: because he commandeth that, which he willeth not to effect. But I answere, first that God in his commandements and promises doth not vtter whatsoeuer hee hath decreed, but doth in part onely so farre forth propound his will, as he knoweth it expedient for the saluation of the elect, and the gouerning of all. By his



commandements therefore he sheweth what he liketh, and what hee willeth that we should doe to him, not what hee will doe to vs or in vs. And God who willeth not all things alike in all, doth will conuersion in some only in respect of approbation, exhortation and meanes: in others he willeth it also as touching the decree of working it. Here is no disagreement in the wils, but sundrie degrees of willing in regard of vs, according to which God is said both to will and to nill.
            Secondly I answere, that the reuealed 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . will is neuer contrarie to the will of his good pleasure, or to the decree of God, (with the which it doth alwaies agree both for the beginning, as also in the end and scope) but that it is notwithstanding often diuers, and that in shew it seemeth sometimes contrarie if wee consider the manner wherein it is propounded. God commanded Isaiah to declare vnto Hezekiah his death: and hee did also denounce Esa. 38. destruction vnto the Niniuites Ion. 3. 4. within fourtie daies: and yet he had decreed to put neither of them both in execution.



The humane wil of Christ did with Mat. 26. 3. an holy dissention in some sort will deliuerance from the agony of death, which notwithstāding the diuine willed not. Abraham 
               Gen. 28. prayed without doubt by diuine inspiration, & therefore with faith that the Sodomites might be spared, and yet he knew that in Gods decree they were appointed to destruction. Neither must this seeme strange; for one good thing as it is and remaineth good, may bee different from another thing that is good. Thirdly, thou biddest thy debter pay his debt, though in the meane time thou dost not make him able: why may not God therfore for iust causes command that, which he himselfe will not do?
            The exhibiting of the Mediator is that, whereby the Sonne of God being borne 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . man in the fulnes of time doth pay the price of redēption to God for the sins of men. The vertue and efficacie of this price being paid, in respect of merit and operation is infinite; but yet it must be distinguished, for it is either potentiall or actuall. The potentiall efficacie is, wherby the price is in it selfe sufficient to redeeme euery



one without exception from his sins, albeit there were a thousand worlds of men. But if we consider that actuall efficacie, the price is payd in the counsell of God, and as touching the euent only for those which are elected and predestinated. For the Sonne doth not sacrifice for those, for whom hee doth not pray: because to make intercession and to sacrifice are conioyned: but hee prayeth onely for the elect and for beleeuers, Ioh. 17. 9. and by praying he offereth himselfe to his Father. verse 19. For (as Illyricus hath well obserued) this whole prayer in the 17. chapter is indeed (as he speaketh) an oblatory and expiatory prayer, or (as the Papists call that blasphemous forme) a Canon or rule of sacrifice, by which Christ hath offered himselfe a sacrifice to the Father for the sinnes of the world. Therefore the price is appointed and limited to the elect alone by the Fathers decree, and the Sons intercession and oblation. Secondly Christ bare their person, and stood in their roome vpon the crosse, for whom he is a mediator: and consequently, whatsoeuer Christ did as a redeemer, the same did all Ephes. 1. 6. Coloss. 3. 1.


               
those in him & with him which are redeemed: Christ dying, rising again, ascending & sitting at the right hand of the Father, they also die with him, rise againe, ascend and sit at the right hand of God. Now that all these things can be truly said of the elect only, and of such as beleeue, I proue it thus. To say that any one of the wicked, which are to perish for euer, is raised vp in Christ rising againe, is flat against the truth: because the raysing vp of Christ is (that I may so speake) his actuall absolution from their sins for whom he died: for euen as the Father by deliuering Christ to death, did in very deede condemne their sins imputed vnto Christ, for whom he died; so by raysing him vp from death, euen ipso facto he did absolue Christ from their sinnes, and did withall absolue them in Christ: but being absolued from their sins they shall not perish, but be saued. Therefore that wicked man which perisheth for his sin, cannot be said to haue risen againe with Christ: and therefore Christ did not beare his person vpon the crosse. Thirdly the expiatory sacrifice sanctifieth those, for whom it is a sacrifice, as the holie



Ghost plainly and absolutely auoucheth, Heb. 9. 13. 14. The sacrifice and sanctification appertaine to the same persons: and Christ is their perfect Sauiour, whom he saueth not only by meriting their saluation, but also by working it effectually. But Christ doth sanctifie only the elect and such as beleeue: therefore he was a sacrifice only for them. And this was the iudgment of the ancient Church in this point. Augustine saith, He which spared not his

And the casting out of the prince of this world, is the reconciliation of the nations of the elect. Againe, I will draw all things to my selfe: what all things? namely All Elect Things, as all the members follow their head. Haimo: Christ hath taken away in the Elect not onely originall,

            The Application is, when as Christ is giuen vnto vs of God the Father by the Spirit, in the lawfull vse of the Word and Sacraments; and is receiued of vs by the instrument of a true faith. And Christ being giuen, is made vnto vs of God wisdome, righteousnes, sanctification and redemption. 1. Cor. 1. 30.
            
            The accomplishment of the application is Glorification, whereby God shal be all in all by Christ in all the elect.
            By this which hath been said, it is apparent, that the decree of election is the cause and foundation of all good giftes and workes in men. From hence is true faith. Act. 13. 48. As many as were ordained vnto eternall life beleeued. And calling: Rom. 8. whom he predestinated, them he called. And: who are called of his purpose. Hence Adoption: Eph. 1. predestinated to

                  te who are his. Excellent is that saying of Augustine: He did choose no man worthie, but by chusing he made him worthie. Againe, Cont. Iul. Pelag. lib. 5. cap. 3. In Psal. 41. 
               It is the grace of God, whereby he doth elect me, not because any worthines is in me, but because it doth vouchsafe to make me worthie. Againe, And did not they also afterwa
                     •
                  ds chuse him, and preferre him before all the good things of this life? but they did chuse him because they were chosen; they were not chosen, because they chused him. And thus much of the decree of election.
            The decree of reprobation is a worke of Gods prouidence, whereby he hath decreed to passe by certaine men, in regard of supernaturall grace for the manifestation



of his iustice and wrath in their due destruction: or, it is his will, whereby he suffreth some man to fall into sinne, and inflicteth the punishment of condemnation for sinne.
            It hath in like manner two actes. The first is the purpose to forsake some men, and to make knowen his iustice in them. This act hath a finall cause, but no impulsiue cause out of God. For it ariseth of Gods meere good pleasure, no respect had of good or euill in the creature. For the will of God is the cause of causes: therfore we must make our stand in it, and out of or beyond it no reason must be sought for: yea indeed there is nothing beyond it. Moreouer euery man (as Paul 
               Rom. 9. 21. auerreth) is vnto God, as a lumpe of clay in the potters hand: and therefore God according to his supreme authoritie doth make vessels of wrath, he doth not find them made. But hee should not make them, but find them made, if we say that God willed in his eternall counsell, to passe by men only as they are sinners, and not as they are men for causes most iust, though vnknowen to vs. Thirdly, if God



did reiect men, because he foresaw that they would reiect him, reprobatiō should not depend vpon God, but vpon men themselues. And this is all one, as if a man should say, that God foresaw that some would chuse him, and others refuse him. And the contempt of the Gospell doth not befall infants, which die out of the couenant of the Gospell. Fourthly, Paul, who was a most skilful defender of Gods iustice, doth exclude all workes in the first place, out of this wonderfull election of one from another, made in the counsell of God: Not by worke
                     •
                  , saith he; and therefore excludeth all respect of sinne; then Rom. 9. 11. afterwards being rauished with admiration, he quieteth himselfe in the alone will of God, Who hath resisted his will? But, O man, who art thou which pleadest against 
               Rom. 9. 19. 20. Rom. 11. 33 
               God? Againe, O the deepenes of the riches, both of the wisedome and knowledge of God: how vnsearchable are his iudgments, and his waies past finding out! To conclude▪ if it be demaunded why God created this world and no more, we must haue recourse 
                  〈◊〉
                
               
                  •
               he meere will of God: and why must we not doe so, if it be demaunded why God electeth



this man, and forsaketh that man or another? Author de vec. gent. A part of mankinde is redeemed, a part perisheth. But who can tell, why God doth not pity them, and pitieth these? the reason of the distinction is vnknowen, but the distinction or separation it selfe is not knowen.
            
            The second act is the ordaining of them to punishment or due destruction. This ordination in respect of the diuerse consideration thereof, may be distinguished: and so it is either simple or comparatiue. The simple ordination is that, wherby this man, suppose Peter or Iohn, is ordained to punishment. And this ordination is of the most iust will of God, yet not without respect of originall and actuall sinnes. For as men are actually damned for sin: so God hath decreed to damne them for the same sinne. Yet notwithstanding sin is not the cause of the decree of reprobation, but in regard of order it goeth before in Gods fore-knowledge, not that former, but this latter act. The ordination which stands in comparison is that, whereby one man and not another, and this man rather then that being in the like condition, is ordeined to



punishment. This serueth to shew the libertie of Gods will, in the dispensation of supernaturall benefits. For in that God chuseth this man and not that, it declareth the libertie and very great perfection of God: and therefore vnder the name of an housholder, he challengeth the same vnto himselfe, when he saith: May I not do

                  . 20. 15. 
               with my own what I list? And verely though God destroy and condemne all those whom he doth forsake, yet should he not be iniust. For we our selues in the daily killing and slaughtering of beasts will not be counted vniust, neither indeed are we: and yet in comparison of God we are not so much worth, as a flie is in respect of vs. If it be lawfull for thee to receine in, or to thrust out any out of thine house, because thou wilt; it were a point of desperate boldnes to take the same right from God in his house.
            The cause of this comparatiue ordination, is the sole wil of God, yea euen without respect of any sinne at all. So Augustine: God deliuereth no man but of his free mercy, and condemneth no man but m
                     •
                  st righteously. Now why he deliuereth this man



rather then that, let him search, who can diue into the great depth of his iudgements. Againe, why is it thus to this man, and otherwise 
               Lib. 1. ad Simpl. q. 2. 
               to this? O man, who art thou that thou darest dispute with God? And Gregorie: Let 
               Expos. in Ioan. ca. 37. 
               no man desire to search, wherefore one should bee elected when another is reiected▪ because his iudgements are vnsearchable, and his waies past finding out. In this second act of reprobation there be two degrees, a iust desertion or forsaking, & damnation for sinne. So Fulgentius: In such (saith he) Lib. a
                     •
                   Mo
                     •
                  . 
               God begins his iudgement by forsaking, and ends it in 
                     •
                  ormenting. Diuine desertion is twofold. The first is that, whereby God doth forsake man, only in regard of his assistance and strengthning, by omitting the confirmation of the creature, and by not conferring the second grace, wherby the first might be made effectuall to resist temptations, and to perseuere in goodnesse. Desertio explora
                     •
                  i
                     •
                  
                  nis. This is the desertion of triall, and may happen to them, who haue not thē
               selues as yet forsaken God. For it was in the first man Adam, who receiued of God power to do that which he would, but not will to do that which be could. So Augustine:


               
               He receiued (saith he) power if he willed: 
               De correp. & grat. cap. 11. 
               but he had not will answerable to his power, for if he had had he should haue perseuered. Againe, He was able also to perseuere; if he would: and in that he would not it proceeded offree will, which then was so free, that he was able to will well and ill. The cause of this desertion was, that Adam and his posterity might know that they could fall by themselues, but that they could not stand, much lesse rise againe: and therefore that they should wholly depend on Gods mercy. Heere also it must be remembred, that betweene this desertion and Adams sin, there came also Adams will, whereby he being left to his owne strength, did by and by perceiue the very same, his conscience telling: and yet for all that he willed his owne fall by the free motion of his will.
            The second desertion is a priuation and leesing of the gifts, wherwith the mind is adorned, and a deliuering into the power of Sathan, that he may seduce men, and more and more lead them into sinne. This is a desertion of punishment, and therefore Desertio poenae. it followeth sinne. And of this desertion,



and not of the former, is the rule to be vnderstood, A Deo deserti Deum priores deserunt, those which are forsaken of God, do themselues first forsake God.
            And this is our doctrine of Predestination, which sauoreth neither of the errors of the Manichees, Stoickes, Pelagians, nor of Epicurisme, but is (as I am perswaded) agreeable to the truth, and orthodoxall: but yet it is oppugned by sundrie criminations, or false accusations, which I will striue with all my strength to ouerthrow, and that briefely.
            
               The first Crimination is,
               That we teach, that certaine men and those but few are elected.
               
                  Answere. Certaine men we say. For all the elect are knowne vnto God, and their number can neither be increased nor diminished. Few we do not say, but after a prescript and certaine manner. For (to omit the Angels) if you consider the elect by themselues, they are many. Matth. 8. 11. I say



vnto you, that many shall come from the East, and West, and shall sit downe with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob in the kingdome of heauen. Reuel. 7. 9. I beheld and loe a great multitude, which no man could number of all nations, kindreds, people and tongues, stood before the throne and before the Lambe, cl

Beda calleth those a world to

               Neuerthelesse, if those same elect be compared with them that are iustly damned, wee say according to the Scriptures that they are few. Matth. 7. 13. 14. The gate is narrow and the way streight which leadeth vnto life, and few there be which find it. Againe, Many are called, but few are chosen, Matth. 20. 16.
            
            
               The second Crimination is,
               That we teach, that God ordained men to hell fire, and created them to the end that he might destroy them.
               
                  Answere. Here the distinction of the double act in reprobation must bee repeated and retained. First therefore I answere, that reprobation in regard of the former act is absolute, that is, in regard of the purpose to forsake the creature, and to manifest Iustice in it: so we teach, and beleeue. For we cannot so much as imagine a cause in



the creature, why it was Gods wil to passe by it, and to suffer some to fall finally from their blessed estate. Yea sinne is it selfe after the desertion and iust permission of God: and therefore it can by no meanes be the cause of the permission and desertion. Whence it is that Lumbard the Lib. 1. dist. 41. Master of all the Schoolemen saith, that God hath reiected whom he would, not for any future merits which he did foresee, but yet most righteously, though we cannot conceiue the reason thereof. And Ierome long before him dothd thus expound y• place of Paul, 
                  Ad Hebid. quaest. 10. Rom. 9. 11. (Ere the children were borne, and whē they had neither done good nor euill) If Esau (saith hee) and Iacob were not yet borne, neither had done good or euill, whereby they might win

Afterwards: If we grant this, that God doth what soeuer hee will, and that he either chuseth or condemneth a man without desert and workes: it is not therefore in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercie. Againe: Therefore it is in

                     knew that he should haue. Secondly, that no man is predestina

                        m hee did predestinate freely, purposedlie and of his pure mercie. Fourthly, that no man is reiected for the euill vsing of freewill, which God foresaw he would be tainted with. Fiftly, that there is not any reiected, because hee was foreknowne to haue finally an impedimēt of diuine grace. Sixtlie, that whomsoeuer God reiected, him hee did reiect without anie cause in him. The very same conclusions hath Petrus de Alliaco, lib. 1. sent. quaest. 12. art. 2. and Marsilius of Inghen, lib. 1. dist. 42. q. 4. Some of whose words I will set downe: He is predestinated (saith he) to whom God hath purposed to giue euerlasting life. And he is reiected, on whom God hath determined not to bestow the same, as the Apostle teacheth, Rom. 9. Againe: No man, that is predestinated, is predestinated for any thing, which should bee in him in time to come: so also there is no reprobate reiected for any cause, which was to be in him in time to come. And euery one that is predestinate, is predestinated only by grace, & by Gods mercifull disposition, not for any cause either actuall or priuatiue to bee found in him, whiles hee liueth.

The cause and reason of the whole worke of reprobation cannot be said to bee in the reprobates, for sinne it selfe cannot be the cause of that pennission of sinne, for which a man is damned, whether it bee originall or actuall, as it appeareth in infants who die only with originall sinne: which verely, howsoeuer it may be the cause why infants are forsaken in it, yet neuerthelesse it cannot bee the cause and reason, why the whole nature of man should be suffered to fall in Adam.

Againe, We denie that God is cruell, for we say that God doth not punish and torment the reprobate for the fulfilling (as it were) of his owne fancie, but for sinne eternally foreknowne, which he determined so to dispose of by punishing of it, that his iustice might be made manifest.

vpō 
                  Iohn: Why 
                  Lib. 3. c. 161. 
                  hee draweth this man, and not that, do not desire to iudge, if thou wouldest not erre.
               
               Neuerthelesse reprobation in regarde of the second act, that is, in respect of the purpose to damne, is not absolute but for sinne. For no man perisheth but thorough his owne default; and no man is absolutely ordained to hell or destruction, but for his sinne; hauing also receiued before in Adam power, whereby hee was able to liue holily and happely, if so be that hee would. And therefore I say that that which they alleage is a very calumnie.
               
                  
Secondly I answer, that God did not simply create man to destroy him, but that he might manifest his iudgement by the iust destruction of the sinner. Now it is one thing to will the destruction of a man as hee is man; and another thing to will the deserued destruction of a man as he is a sinner. Heere also the iudgemēt of Cameracēsis a iudicial Scholeman is to bee heard and obserued. According to the Scripture (saith hee) although God should punish or afflict some creature eternally, or vtterly abolish it without any sinne in it, yet he should not deale vniustly or cruelly



with it. Whence it is, Wisedome 12. 12. Who dare accuse thee, if the nations perish which thou hast made?—God is not bound to lawes created, as if any thing were iust before God did will i

               We say that Adams fall came to passe



God not only foreknowing but also willing and decreeing it: and that without blasphemie, if thou wilt friendly and curteouslie giue leaue to shew how far forth and in what manner. The will of God is twofold, generall and speciall. The special wil (which the scripture calleth, Cephets) is that by which God doth both approue and effect a thing: or else it is Gods good pleasure, whereby taking delight in some thing he doth will it simply, both as touching the doing of it, as also in respect of approbation. The obiect of this will dependeth on the will, and followeth it as the effect followeth the cause. And by this will our iudgement is, according to the word of God, that God willeth that which is good, and

                  of vngodlinesse. And, Hee doth onely foreknow, and not preordaine euils. And, It is all one to say God is the author and God willeth. The generall will is that whereby



God willeth a thing not to bee, (for that, which is not, therefore is not, because hee willeth it shall not bee) and for certaine causes also hee willeth not to hinder some things, and consequently willeth that they shal come to passe; which things notwithstanding hee doth not simplie approue. Or, it is the decree of God, whereby hee willeth some thing, not in respect of approbation and effecting of it by himself, but only in respect of suffering it to be done by others. And here the thing which is to be done doth not depend vpō Gods will, but onely vpon the will of the creature which falleth away: and with this will we say that God willed the fall of Adam, yet not simplie but onely that it should come to passe. Now it is one thing to will a thing by it selfe, and another thing to wil it as touching the euent. Moreouer hee willeth the euent of sinne, not by effecting it himselfe: but by forsaking or not hindring when he might if he would. And if we enquire of the order of willing, it is this, first and properly God doth will not to inhibit, and not to hinder sinne: and by consequent onely hee



willeth the euent of sinne. For that which God doth nor hinder, doth therfore come to passe, because hee doth nor hinder it: and as no good thing can either bee or come to passe, vnlesse God make it: so no euill thing can be auoyded, except God doe hinder. And there is not the least thing which may bee done without this will; vnlesse we will say that Gods prouidence is idle; which to say were wicked. The reasons of this our iudgement are many. The first reason I will draw out of most euident testimonies of Scripture. Act. 2. 23. Him I say being deliuered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of God, after you had taken, with wicked hands you haue crucified and slain. Act. 4. 27. 28. They gathered themselues together, to doe whatsoeuer thine hand and thy counsell had determined before to be done. Here it is to be obserued, that not only Christs passion but also the works which in respect of the Iewes were wicked, doe come vnder the decree and will of God: to wit, so far forth as God willed that they should come to passe for iust endes. This very thing Augustine signifieth when he saith,



                  When the father deliuered the son, and Christ 
                  Epist. ad Vnio. 38. 
                  his bodie, and Iudas his master: In this deliuering wherefore is God iust and man guilty, but because in one thing which they did, there is not one cause for which they did it? And there is no reason yr it should seeme harsh vnto any, if speaking of Adās fall we follow the holy scripture on this manner. When Adam did eate of the forbidden fruite, he did eate that, which the hand and counsell of God had determined before to bee done. This is that very thing which we say: This is the language of the Apostles and of the Church, which therefore we may vse without the least suspition of blasphemie. But to the former testimonies I will adde one place out of Peter, 1. Epist. 3. 17. It is better (if the will of God be so) that yee suffer for well doing, than for euill doing. But to punish men so
                     〈◊〉
                   well doing, in respect of men, it is f

                     •
                  ly to transgresse the law of God. Furthermore God is said to bid Shimet 
                  2. Sam. 16. 10. 
                  to curse Dauid, that is, to haue ordained and decreed, for God biddeth and commandeth a thing two waies, first by his reuealed will; and this he doth by his word de
                     •
                  iuered vnto men. Secondly, by his secret



will, which is his prouidence or hidden decree, by which hee doth so gouerne all things, that nothing can be done without it or against it: as in these places. ser. 34. 22. I will commaund and call backe the Assyrians against this citie. Lam. 3. 37. Who is he then that saith, and it commeth to passe, and the Lord commandeth it not? Iob. 37. 6. He saith to the snow, be thou vpon the earth: likewise to the small raine, and to the great raine of his power. By which it appeareth that it may well be said, that God decreed that Shimei should curse Dauid: and it is the like kind of speech to say, that God did not decree Adams fall simply, but in 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . some respect. The second reason followeth: it is the common opinion of all men that God doth will to suffer sinne, but to will to suffer it, is to will not to hinder it, and to will not to conferre grace. Now he which foreknoweth some future euill, and willeth not to hinder it when hee might, and not to conferre confirming grace, he doth indeed will that the same should come to passe. Therefore we doe not place that will, whereby wee say that God doth will that sinne should come to



passe and bee in nature, either without or beyond the diuine permission, but we doe enwrap and enfold it in it. And this is that which Caluin saith and no other: It 
                  In Genes. cap. 3. ver. 1. 
                  often offendeth some

                     ēs eares to heare that God willed the fall of man. But I pray you what other thing is his permission besides wil, who hath authoritie to hinder, and in whose power the matter standeth? The same affirmeth Beza: If any man heare that some 
                  Ad acta. colloq. Mampelg. pag. 152 
                  things come to passe, which indeed are done against his will, that is, against his liking, not because he cannot, but because he will not hinder thē: I answer, that it is all one as if a mā should say that they come to passe hee being willing they should. For those things, which he could surely hinder if he would, must needs come to passe, because by not hindring of them he willeth that they should come to passe. And whatsoeuer God doth not hinder, he doth therefore not hinder it, either because he willeth that it should be done, or because he doth vtterly nill that it shuld be done, or because he doth not will it should bee done, or else because hee cares not: that is, hee neither willeth nor nilleth that it should come to passe. If you graunt the



first, I haue my desire. The second is absurd; namely that God doth not hinder euill, because hee doth vtterlie nill that it should bee done. For this is to make God incōstant. The third, Lumbard and the schoolemen affi
                     •
                  me. For they say that God in respect of sinne hath no positiue act, neither of willing nor of nilling, but onely a negatiue act of not willing to hinder it. But by this meanes a great part of those things, which are done in the world should come to passe God being either ignorant or negligent. The very permission also is a certaine will and not a pure negation: for no
                     •
                  to will to hinder, that is, to suffer, is indeed to will not to hinder. If thou wilt say the fourth, thou doest wickedly make an idle and Epicurish god, therefore wee must needs retire vnto the first, viz. that God' doth decree that euill should come to passe in such sort as I haue declared. Yet the fault must not bee for all that translated vnto him, because he doth iustly and holily decree that which men doe wickedly.
               Thirdlie, we know that Adams reuolting is now past and done; therefore wee



must say that God did will that it should be done; vnlesse we shall say that his prouidence is not in all, and euerie thing. Thou wilt say that an euill worke is ordeined of God, that is, disposed to Gods glorie, the saluation of the godly, and the destruction of the wicked. I grant it, but not this onely. For the prouidence of God is ouer the world and euery thing therein: both in respect of the ende, as also of the beginning of euerie action: Sathan and the wicked doe not onely not finish, that which they would, but they doe not so much as begin it, vnlesse God willeth and giueth leaue. It seemeth impious to thinke that any thing, though as little as may be, doth either exist or come to passe besides that, which God being alwaies holy and inst hath willingly from all eternitie decreed.
               Fourthly, let vs heare the iudgement of the ancient Church. Augustine, We must

                  which the Almightie willeth to bee done, either by suffering it to bee done, or by doing it himselfe. Againe: Sometimes a man willeth a thing with a holy will, which God willeth not. Againe: It is possible that a man should will this with an euill will, which God willeth with a good will. So much difference is there twixt what is fitting for man to will, and what is fitting for God to will, and to what end euery one referreth his will, so as that it may bee allowed or disapprooued. And againe: Know that whatsoeuer falleth out here contrarie to our will, happeneth not but by the 
                  In Psal. 148. 
                  will of God, his prouidence, ordinance, appointment and decrees. Tertullian: God hath foreknowne all things by disposing them, and 
                  Cont. Marcel. lib. disposed them by foreknowing them. Ierome: Shall I say that any thing is done 
                  In Abacuc. cap. 1. 
                  without thee, and that the wicked can doe so much against thy will? Surely it were blasphemie so to imagine. And againe: What good or euill things soeuer are in the world, 
                  In Ierem. 12. cap. 
                  they happen not by casuall chance, and without the prouidence of God, but by his pleasure. Hugo saith: Men may well endure

                  the hearing of this, and it may be said without any scruple or trouble of conscience, God



willeth that which is good. But if it bee said, God willeth that which is euill, it is a thing very grieuous to bee heard, and a religious minde doth not easily conceits of that which is goodnesse it selfe, that it willeth euil: for then it seemeth to be said that the good loueth that which is euill, and approueth that which is bad, and therefore a godly minde reiecteth this, not because that which is said is not well said, but because that which is well said is not well vnderstood. But after what sort it ought to bee vnderstood, hee himselfe in the selfe same place explaneth. This (saith he) is onely said, and yet another thing is meant and vnderstood, because God willeth that euill be, and yet willeth not the euill, And againe: He will that euill be, and yet

And againe: When hee doth good and suffereth euill, his will appeareth in this, because he wils that to be which he doth or permitteth. And againe: The will of God is his good pleasure, and his will is his working, and his Will is his Permission. Catharinus In ep. 
                        〈◊〉
                      ad Rom. saith: We need not be afraid to confesse that God willeth sinne, as blessed Augustine saith also, not because he willeth sinne as it is sinne



and euill, but as it is good, to wit, as it is is the punishment of sinne and vengeance in the reprobate (for that is Gods purpose, and it is good and not euill) or as sinne it selfe is an occasion vnto good in his beloued and elect.
               
               But they vse to obiect thus: To will that euill be done is proper and belonging to an euill will which is delighted with euils, or would vse them to good, contrary to the rule: That no euill should be done that good might come thereof. To this I answere: That heere are two grounds to bee laid. The first is, that the obiect euen of mans will is good, and therefore much more of Gods will, and the obiect of the will cannot be euill by it selfe but by accident: for if the will willeth euill, it willeth it not as it is euill, but as it is good. The second ground is, that there is a certaine summum bonum or soueraigne good with which there is no euill conioynd; because there is a certaine thing infinitely good, namely God: but there is not any absolute euill, because there is nothing so euill, but it hath some good ioyned therewith, and therefore it is good that sinne should be and come to



passe. So saith S. Augustine: Although

                  therfore those things which are euill, so farre forth as they are euill are not good, neuerthelesse it is good that there should bee not onely good things, but also euill. For vnlesse this were good, that there should be also euils, they should

First we consider sinne not as it is sinne, but so farre foorth as it hath some respect vnto good with God which decreeth it. And this way taking sinne, although God willeth it not simply and by it selfe, yet he decreeth it and willeth it as touching the euent. Moreouer sinne hath respect vnto God two manner of waies, first, because it is in that which is good: secondly, because it tendeth to that which is good. I say it is in that which is good; because euery euill is in that which is good as in the subiect. Now in respect of the subiect, that is, as sinne is a motion, an inclination, or an action, God both willeth and effecteth the same. Moreouer sin



tendeth to that which is good, because God ordaineth it to good, and from thence draweth the good either of triall, chastisement, or punishment. And we say that God is so farre foorth willing that sinne should come to passe, as hee is able and will by his wonderfull wisedome from thence to draw foorth that which is good.
               Secondly, we consider sinne according God did n
                        •
                     t decree the fall of Adam, nor any sin as it is 
                        〈◊〉
                      vnto God. to the propertie and naturall being thereof, that is, sinne as it is sinne; And this way also we weigh sinne either so far forth as it is sinne in it selfe in regard of men, or as it is sinne to God. But God himselfe neither willeth, nor approueth, nor effecteth sinne, as it is sinne in it selfe in regard of the creatures that offend; and yet hee willeth as touching the euent, not simplie, as those things that are good in themselues, but only by willing to permit that it may be. For there is a threefold action of Gods wil, the first is that whereby God willeth any thing by willing it, that is, when he willeth it with his whole and absolute will, as Tertullian saith, and this way he willeth that which is good in it



selfe. The second action is that, whereby he nilleth any thing by nilling it, as that which shall neuer come to passe, because God doth vtterly nill the being thereof. The third and last action is remisse and in the middest betweene both, whereby hee willeth some thing by nilling it slackely or remissely, that is, when hee partly willeth it and partly nilleth it, or else so far forth wills it, as that for iust causes he nills it. And after this sorte wee say, that God willeth the euent of euill, as it is euill in it selfe in respect of men; because euill as it is euill after this sorte, is not absolutely euill: and God draweth good out of euill as it is euill in the nature thereof or in it selfe: as hee brought forth light out of darkenesse, euen as it was darkenesse in it selfe. And if so be that euill were absolurely euill, as God is absolutely good, he would in no wise will the euent of euill, neither should there be any euill existent at all. For that which God vtterly nilleth, hath not any being or existence. But sin as it is sin to God, (now that is a sinne to God which is in it selfe sinne, in his decree whereby all things are ordained as it considereth



sinne) hee neither willeth it, nor approueth it, nor worketh it, no in this respect he doth not so much as permit it. I doe not denie but that God permitteth and suffreth euill, as it is euill in it selfe, (otherwise there were not euill properly and naturally) but I denie that he permitteth it, because it is euill. For God neuer suffreth euill for it selfe, but for the good that is therewith conioyned. And this is the meaning of that saying of Beza: The Lord neuer permitteth sins, as they are sins,

                  yea rather be euermore forbiddeth and hindreth them. And againe: Sinnes so farre forth as they are permitted by God being thereto willing, are not sinnes but the punishments of sinne. And thus vsing this exposition is the mind and iudgement of Master Caluin of blessed memorie to bee vnderstood, where as he saith that all the sons of Adam did fall away by Gods will: And againe, that it was decreed by God that Adam should perish by his owne falling away. 
                  Instit. lib. 3. cap. 23. 5. 4. & 5. 7. And againe, it was the secret counsell of God, in which the fall of man was ordained. And againe: Adam did not fall away but according to Gods knowledge and ordinance.

In these and such like maner of speeches his purpose was, to ouerthrow the opinion of the Schoolemen, who would haue his permission seuered from his will: It were good therefore for them better to consider of the matter, who without either chatitie or humanitie doe with the blasphemies of the Manichees slaunder and bely this holy man.
               Secondly they vse to obiect, that God willeth things contrarie, if hee will that that should come to passe which hee forbiddeth in his law. Answer. It is true indeed, if he should will one and the same thing to come to passe and not to come to passe in one and the same respect and manner: but God forbiddeth euill as it is euill, and willeth it to come to passe as it hath respect vnto good. Heereupon Aquinas saith, That euill be and that euill bee not, are contradictorilie opposed; but that 
                  Summ. q. 9. art. 9. 
                  God willeth euill to be, and that God willeth euill not to be, are not contradictorily opposed, seeing both are affirmatiue.
               
               Thirdly, they obiect thus: That thing which being graunted, another thing necessarilie followeth, is the cause of that



selfe same thing that doth follow; but this being granted that God willed the fall of Adam to come to passe, the same came to passe necessarily and infallibly. Therfore the will of God was in this respect the cause of sinne. Whereto I answere, that the first proposition of this argument is not generall, for in admitting the creation of the world, both the place and the time or continuance thereof are infallibly and without doubt also to bee admitted, and yet the creation of the world is not the cause of the continuance thereof, and of the place, where it now consisteth. And that this proposition may be true, it is thus to be framed: That thing which being granted, another thing infallibly followeth (no other cause comming betweene) is the cause of the very same thing that followeth. And the second proposition also sitted to this former is vntrue. For this being granted that God willeth sin to happen, sin shall not come to passe immediatly, but by the meanes of mans free wil; & although it come to passe infallibly on Gods part which decreeth it, yet it comes to passe freely on mans part, for it had been possible



for man not to haue sinned when hee did sinne if hee had would. As may appeare by this Similitude. God forsaketh man by not conserring and bestowing on him necessarie and sufficient helpe for the auoyding of sinnes; now man being forsaken by him, sinneth necessarily; And yet the fault is not to be laid on God, because that in this his forsaking him the will of man commeth betweene. For God forsaketh man being willing to bee forsaken, and not against his will and mind.
               Secondly, I answere to the aforesaid reproch of our doctrine, that wee say not, that sinne is from the decree, or of the decree of God, as from the efficient, materiall, formall, or finall cause. But wee doe teach and au
                     •
                  rre that sinne commeth to passe according to the prouidence, or decree of God, as the sole consequent thereof. For wee assuredly thinke and iudge that the decree of God doth so go before the sinne of man, as that it hath no respect vnto any cause, vnlesse it be of such a one, as is a failing and deficient cause. So saith Augustin: Therefore truely the great works 
                  Enchir. cap. 101. 
                  of the Lord are exquisite in all his wills, so that



after a wonderfull and vnspeakable manner, that is not done beside his will, which notwithstanding is done contrary to his will.
               
               Againe it is obiected. He that saith that the decree of God is the energeticall operatiue beginning of all things, necessarilie maketh the decree of God, the beginning also of sinne. Whereunto I answer, That the holy Ghost himselfe saith that the decree of God is the beginning of all things being and existent; Eph. I. cap. II. verse: God worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will. And againe in the 17. of the Acts, In him we liue, we moue, and haue our being. Augustine saith: The will of God is the very cause of all things which are. Hugo De gene, cont. Manic. lib. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . c. 2 de S. Vict. saith: There is no cause of the will of God, which is the cause of all things. And this very thing common reason will teach vs, because there must first some certaine ground be laid, from whence euery thing should haue or take the being and existence thereof; and this ground is euen the very will of God. For a thing is not first, and then afterward God willeth it to come to passe; but, because God hath decreed that a thing should come to passe,



or be done, therefore it is; And yet shall not God therefore bee the cause of sinne: because sinne is not properly a thing, action, or being, but a defect only: and yet neuerthelesse it is not therefore nothing. For whatsoeuer hath a being, is either E

                     s Real
                        •
                      & Rationale. Really and positiuely, or else in Reason onely. And vnder those things which are in Reason, are contained not only notions and relations, but also priuations: because they haue not a reall matter and forme out of the vnderstanding. But sinne hath not a positiue and reall being, & yet it hath a being in Reason (as they terre it.) For so farre forth it is in the nature of things being, as it may cause a true composition in the mind: and although it doe not exist positiuely, that is, by matter, or forme created; yet it is priuatiuely: because 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . that by the remoue or taking away of originall righteousnesse, that doth immediatly and truly follow and exist. Neither doth it follow, as some other naturall habit, or as a pure negation, but as a certaine thing betweene both, that is, a want and absence of the contrarie good.
               Some vse to obiect that wee doe teach,



that God doth incline vnto sinne and that hee doth positiuely harden the heart. Whereto I answere, that wee allow not a bare permission seuered vtterly from his will, neither doe we atribute a positiue or naturall action vnto God, as though hee did infuse corruption and sinne: and yet we say that hee doth actiuely harden the heart. The action of Gods Prouidence (as saith Suidas) in the works of men is threefold. The first is according to his good pleasure, whereby God willeth any work, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . alloweth it, effecteth it, and is therewith delighted: this action is onely in good workes, which haue their beginning in vs from the holy Ghost. The second action of Gods prouidēce is of sustaining, wherby 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . God vpholdeth and maintaineth, the being, and all the faculties, motions, actions and passions of nature which offendeth. Act. 17. 28. In him we liue, and moue, and haue our being. And although God do sustaine nature offending, and the action of nature, yet is hee free from fault; because he vpholdeth the creature, onely as it is a creature, not as it is euill. For the second cause, as the will of man, can by it



selfe doe euilly and corruptly: yet it can doe nothing by it selfe, vnlesse the effect thereof bee reduced to the first cause. As may appeare more plainly by this similitude: A man doth hault by reason that his legge is out of ioynt: now heere are two things to be considered, the very walking or motion it selfe, and his haulting: the haulting proceedes onely from his legge out of ioynt, the walking both from his legge and also from the facultie of mouing. In like manner a man sinning, in that he doth it is of God, but in that he doth euilly, it is of himself. We must therfore heere know that God doth vphold order as it is of nature, but furthereth not the will violently breaking out against the order of the morall law. The third 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . action of Gods prouidence is according vnto concession, whereby God in the euil worke of man worketh some things holily; and this last action is threefold. The first is permission: whereby God forsaketh especially the wicked by withdrawing from them his grace, and by leauing them according to their deserts vnto their owne wickednesse, which hee had before



restrained, that it might not breake forth to so immoderate libertie. And wee vse commonly to say, that he which permitteth, doth and effecteth some thing: as when the rider giueth the reines vnto his wanton and sporting horse, wee say that hee doth moue and encourage him; and wee say that the hunter doth put his dog on the game, when as hee letteth him slip. The second action (as I may so terme it) is occasionall, whereby God by proffered occasions, in themselues good or indifferent, outwardly draweth foorth, stirreth vp, and bringeth out sinne in those who of themselues openly runne into wickednesse; to the intent that hee may either iustly punish their knowne impietie, or else discouer it being closely shrouded. The like haue wee ordinarily euen among our selues: for the Physitian by his preseruatiue medicine, stirreth vp, inflameth, and draweth foorth the humours out of the corruption of the bodie. Admit a house be weakely timbred, which being almost now already falne wilere lōg fall; and that I doe not with any engines or instruments throw or beate down the same,



but onely take away the outward hindrances, and on euery side as it were open a way for the downfall, to the intent, that when it falleth, it may by the greater fall be broken in peeces. After this sort dealeth God with the wicked: and hereupon is it that the law is said to stirre vp and increase sinne in Paul, Rom. 7. 8. This action is done many manner of waies, as when the hindrances of sinne are taken away: when as the way is opened to the committing of one especiall sinne, and not of another: when as obiects are offered, which the vngodly vse as instigations vnto sinne. These obiects, are commandements, threatnings, exhortations, and cogitations either good or indifferent put by God in the mindes of vngodly men, from the which the wicked by reason of his wickednesse doth greedily take an occasion to doe ill. And this is the manner and way truly, whereby wee say that God stirreth man vnto euill, without infusing the least drop or iot of euill. For as in the middle region of the aire the heate groweth stronger by the antiperistasis or repulsion on euery part, from whence proceeds



the thunder and lightning: and by the heate round incompassed, the clowdes are condensated and made thicke: euen so the wicked and vngodly when they are stirred vp by wholsome precepts, doe grow more vngodly: and euill doth so much the more begin to delight them, by how much the more they know that it is lesse lawfull for them: according to the saying of the Poet: Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimus
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      negara: We still endeuour things forbid, and couet thats denide. The third action is a disposing, whereby God through the euill worke of an euill instrument, finisheth his owne worke iustly and holily. As for example: The sale of Ioseph in his brethren was sin: the iust action of God in this euill worke was the foresending of Ioseph into Aegypt for the common good and benefit of Iacobs familie. And from this disposing proceedes it, that God vseth the sins of men 
                     •
                  olily, that hee prouoketh them holily, and ordreth them as the Physition for a medicine ordreth poyson, contrary to the nature thereof: that he ordreth them holily both according to the causes, and beginnings,



and also according to the ends and issue: as when he disposeth the work of the diuell infusing corruption, either to the punishment of correction, vengeance, or triall. But concerning these let vs rather giue care to ancient writers. Clemens 
                  Strom. lib. 1 
                  Alexandrinus saith: It belongeth to Gods wisedome, vertue, and power, not onely to doe good, which is the nature of God, but also especially to bring vnto some good and profitable end, that which hath been inuented by those which are euill, and vse profitably those things which doe seeme euill. Augustine saith: God maketh and ordaineth iust men: 
                  De gen. ad. lit. imperf. cap. 5. 
                  but hee maketh not sinners as they are sinners, but ordreth them onely. And againe; As God is the most excellent creator of good 
                  De ciuit. Dei lib. 11. cap. 17. Enchir. ad Laur. c. 101. De cor. & grat. c. 14. 
                  natures: so is he the most iust disposer of euill wils. Againe: God verily fulfilleth certaine of his good wils, by the euill wils of euill men. Againe: God by those men which doe those things which hee will not, doth himselfe those things which he will. And againe: God vsing well euen those that are euill as being himselfe absolutely good: so farre foorth as in them lay they did that which God would not; In this very thing that they did that which



was contrarie to Gods will, euen by them his will is done. and againe: Who would not tremble at these iudgements of God, whereby 
                  De grat. & lib. arb. c. 21 
                  God doth in the hearts of euill men what soeuer hee will, giuing vnto them according to their deserts▪
                   And againe: It is plaine that God worketh in the hearts of men to encline their wils whither soeuer he will, either vnto those things that are good for mercie, or else vnto those things that are euill for their deserts, somtimes verily in his open iudgement, sometimes in his secret iudgement, but euermore in his iust iudgement. And againe: God maketh not euill wils, but vseth them as 
                  Cont. Iul. lib. 5. cap. 3. 
                  he list, because hee cannot will any thing that is vniust. Fulgentius saith: Although God be not the author of euill thoughts; yet he is the disposer of euill wils; and out of the euill worke of euery one, he doth not cease to worke that which is good.
               
               In respect of these diuers actions concerning sinne, it commeth to passe that we finde it said in the Scripture, That God doth harden, doth make blinde, doth deceiue, 
                  2. Sam. 12. 12. & 16. 10. & 24. 1 
                  doth command a worke that is euill, yea and doth the same, and that hee deliuereth ouer to beastly affections, &c.
               
               
                  
Thirdly I answere to the aforesaid reproch of this our doctrine, that wee doe vtterly abhorre and detest the Stoicall Fate, because it appointeth an inherent necessitie in things themselues, which should bind euen God himselfe, and all other things, and make them subiect thervnto. For howsoeuer wee doe beleeue that the very decree of God is immutable and therefore necessarie, yet in God himselfe it was most free (for hee could either not haue decreed that which hee did decree, or else otherwise haue decreed it: I and he addeth to the second causes placed out of God a certaine necessitie, but yet so free a one, as that it is rather to be termed a libertie, then a necessitie. And this shall easily appeare to be as I say, if I shall first shew, what sortes of necessitie there bee, and how farre forth it is agreeable vnto thinges. First therefore, a thing is necessary two waies, absolutely & conditionally. That is obsolutely necessarie which cannot be otherwise, or else whose contrarie is impossible, as that God is omnipotent and iust. And that is conditionally necessarie, which cannot be otherwise, but yet



not simply, but by the granting of one or many things: and this kind of necessitie is either by nature, or the commaundement, or decree of God. That is necessarie by nature, which commeth to passe constantly and immutably by reason of that order which God hath set in the nature of things: after this sort is it of necessitie, that fire doe burne, that the earth is carried downeward, and the heauen moued. That is necessarie by commaundement, which is necessarily to be done because God hath commanded it. After this fort it is of necessitie that one vndergoe the office of a magistrate. Rom. 13. 5. That is necessarie by the decree of God, which is so, because God hath foreknowne it, and willed either to effect it, or at the least to permit it. After this sort euery thing in respect of God is necessarie, and the will 
                  De ciuit. Dei lib. 5. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 8. q. 10. & de genesi ad lit. l. 5. c. 15. 
                  of God (as Augustine saith) is the necessitie of things. Secondly, necessitie is either of compulsion or infallibility. Necessitie of compulsion, is that which inferreth violence to things by some cause working without, and forciblie constraineth that they doe either this or that. And this indeed



is the Stoicall necessitie, that a man Tull. de Finibus. should doe any thing against his will being compelled by force and necessitie. There is also such a like kind of necessitie of the Manichees, condemned by the fathers, who taught that there was no violence or necessitie offred vnto the will by God, nor that it was forced by necessitie to sinne. The necessitie of infallibilitie is that whereby a thing according to the euent shall certainly and immutably come to passe: yet so, as if we consider the cause of a thing by it selfe, it may either not come to passe, or else come otherwise to passe. Of this manner of necessitie wee must vnderstand that principle: Euerie thing that is, when it is, is of necessity. And thus is necessitie distinguished: now will I shew how farre forth it is agreeable to seuerall things. The euents of all things haue reference either to the second causes, or to God, who is the first cause. Now some things in respect of the second causes are necessary, othersome contingent. From causes which are necessarie, must needs proceede that which is necessarie, from those that are free, that which is free,



from those that are naturall that which is naturall; and to bee briefe, such as are the next causes aforegoing, such also is the euent of things. But in respect of God, all things whatsoeuer, are partly changeable, and partly necessarie. In respect of Gods libertie, which doth that which it doth freely, all things are contingent and mutable: howsoeuer according to nature and the order of the next causes, they be necessarie and immutable. In respect of Gods decree, the second causes and the effects of them are all necessarie, howsoeuer in themselues they bee vncertaine and conti
                     〈◊〉
                  nt. And yet they are not absolutelie necessarie, but by the supposition of Gods decree, neither are they necessarie by the necessitie of compulsion, but of infallibilitie only, because God ordained before that those things which should come to passe should be. And this kind of necessitie taketh not away the contingencie and libertie of second causes, but rather establisheth and confirmeth it. For that which is free worketh freely, and that which is contingent, worketh contingently, by the necessarie decree of God.



Neither doth libertie and necessitie mutually ouerthrow each other, but libertie and compulsion. It is manifest therefore that Gods decree causeth an immutabilitie to all things, of which notwithstanding some, in respect of the next causes, are necessarie, and othersome contingent; but all of them in respect of Gods liberty mutable. And as the mutabilitie which thinges haue from Gods power, taketh not away the necessitie which they haue from the second causes: so the necessitie of immutabilitie by Gods decree consequently comming to passe, taketh not away the contingencie which they haue from the next causes and Gods libertie. Moreouer wee say, that Gods decree ordaineth the second causes, and the verie libertie it selfe also of mans will, not by compulsion, as if a man should violently throw a stone, but by inclining and gentlie bending them, by obiects outwardlie offred to the vnderstanding (euen as a sheepe is said to be drawne, when grasse is shewed her being an hungry) that a man August. de verb. Apost. ser. 2. may choose by his owne free motion, or



refuse that which God hath iustly decreed from all eternitie.
               These things being granted, it is manifest also what we ought to thinke concerning the fall of Adam. Which truely according to the euent is necessarie by the necessitie of infallibilitie by reason of the forcknowledge and decree of God: yet so as that God is not guiltie of any fault; because the decree of God howsoeuer it was necessarie in it selfe, yet it planted nothing in Adam, whereby he should fall into sinne, but left him to his owne libertie, not hindring his fall when it might; and the same fall in respect of mans wil (which doth that freely that it doth) came to passe contingently and most freely. But, you will say, that Adam could not withstand Gods will, that is, his decree; whereto I answere, that euen as he could not, so also hee would not. But, you will say againe he could not will otherwise. Which I confesse to bee true, as touching the act and euent, but not as touching the very power of his will, which was not compelled but of the owne free motion consented



vnto the suggestiō of the diuell. But to the intent that these things may more plainely bee vnderstood, wee must make distinction betweene three times, the time going before his fall, the present time of his fall, and the time after his fall. In the first moment of time the fal of Adam was necessarie in a double respect: First, by reason of the foreknowledge of God: for that which he foreknew would come to passe, must needes of necessitie come to passe. Secondly, by reason of the permissiue decree of God, that fal was according to the euent necessarie immutably. Honorius Augustodunensis saith, It cannot otherwise 
                  Dial. de praed. citat. in Catalogo Illyrici. 
                  
                     
                        •
                     e but that al things must come to passe, which God hath predestinated & foreknowne, seeing that hee onely either doth all things or permitteth them to be done. Hugo de S. victore saith: Sinne followeth of necessitie by 
                  Quaest. in Rom. 44. 
                  the withdrawing of grace. And the reason hereof is very easie, because euill permitted must come to passe, and cannot otherwise come to passe than God permitteth. For to permit euill, is not to stirre vp the will, and not to bestow on him that is tempted the act of resisting, but to leaue



him as it were to himselfe: and he whose will is not stirred vp by God, and to whō the act of resisting is not conferred, howsoeuer he may haue power to withstand: yet can he not actually will to withstand, nor persist for euer in that vprightnesse wherein hee was created, God denying him strength. I confesse truly that this kinde of necessitie as touching the liberty of mans will, was altogether euitable and to be auoided: and yet according to the euent of the action it was ineuitable. Yet I would not that any man should thinke that this necessitie did any way proceede from the decree of God, which did onely follow the decree being granted and admitted; and Adam in his temptation being destitute of the helpe of God, cast himselfe of his own accord into this same ensuing necessitie of sinning. In the second time, his fall being present, there was another necessitie thereof: because when it was it was of necessitie. In the third time, man drew vnto himselfe by his fault, his nature being now corrupted, another necessitie of sinning, insomuch that he made himselfe the seruant of sin.



                  Bernard saith: I know not after what euill and strange manner, the will it selfe corrupted or changed to worse maketh a necessitie to sinne: and yet the necessitie although it be voluntarie is not able to excuse the will: nor the will, although it bee enticed, to exclude necessitie.
               
               If any man shall say, that by this our platforme many are tied by an ineuitable necessitie to bee damned; I would haue him giue care to Augustine, who saith: Hold this most stedfastly, and doubt not in 
                  De fide ad Pet. cap. 35. 
                  any wise that any can perish whom God before the creation of the world, hath of his free goodnesse made vessels of mercie,—or that any of them whom he hath not predestinated to eternall life, can by any meanes be saued. And yet I say that the decree of reprobation doth not cause a necessitie of damnation in any man. For the first act thereof, which is a purpose not to shew mercie, causeth not this necessitie in men, but goeth before it as an antecedent: and man himselfe verily hath brought vpon himselfe this necessitie with his owne most free, yet rebelling will. Now the second act of Reprobation, which is a purpose of



condemning, causeth not any necessitie of damnation, but by the sinne of man comming betweene. Moreouer, the necessitie of damnation followeth after the same manner by the foreknowledge of God: and yet this neuer seemed a thing strange vnto any one. But some will say, that the foreknowledge of God doth neuer cause in men any necessitie of damnation, although it doe assuredly foresee the same. And I say also, that Reprobation doth either not at all cause damnation in man, or that it doth not cause it, but for sinne. But it may be obiected: They that are predestinated vnto damnation, cannot be freed by repentance, although they would. Whereto I answere with Augustine: As they did fall by their will, so by their will they are content to lie: and he that turneth himselfe 
                  Ar
                        •
                     . 15. 
                  away from God, hath both depriued himselfe of will to doe that which is good, and also of power. It doth not therefore follow (as they imagine which obiect such things) that God hath taken repentance from those to whom he gaue it not, and hath throwne downe those, whom he hath not taken vp.
               
               Moreouer, the selfe same necessitie followeth



of their hypothesis, who affirme a bare permission. For that which God permitteth, the selfe same thing will hee not hinder▪ and euill, if God hinder not, cannot bee auoyded: and that which cannot be auoyded, shall come to passe infallibly. And therfore euill, permission being once graunted, of necessitie cōmeth to passe, although most freely on mans part. Whereupon it is plaine, that the decree of God is not more ineuitable, than is the very permission separated from the decree. I doe wish that they would well weigh and cō
                  sider this, who obiect vnto vs either the Stoicall fate, or the do
                     •
                  ages of the Manichees. For we differ from them as much in certaine iudgement & opinion, as whosoeuer doe differ most. For first, the Stoickes doe tie God vnto the second causes, so that he cannot doe otherwise, then the nature of them will suffer: wee on the other side, doe hold that all second causes do depend vpon and are ordered by God. Secondly, the Stoickes say, that neither God nor second causes can doe otherwise by their nature than they doe: wee say that some second causes, are by Gods



ordinance mutable, othersome immutable; and that God himselfe, can either not doe, that which hee doth, or else doe it otherwise. But now to come to the Manichees, who make two coeternall gods; we but one. They of their two Gods, make one good, and another euill: we say, that there is one absolutely good & iust God. Thirdly, they wil haue one of their Gods to bee the cause and worker of good things, and the other of euil: we make one true God the creatour and ruler of all things, and working nothing but that which is most good and most iust. Fourthly, they say that they which are created by their good God cannot sinne: we say, that God doth most freely conuert whom hee will, and when they are conuerted, they can neuer in this life perfectly be free frō sinnes, but doe sometimes run into such sinnes, as doe grieuously wound the conscience. Fiftly, they say, that they that are created by the euil God simply cannot be conuerted: wee say, that vncleane spirites and men were created both good and holy, but yet they fell by their owne will and fault, and not by any fault but the iust



permission of the Creatour, and brought vpon themselues a necessitie of sinning. And although it be true, that man cannot withhold himselfe from sinning, vnlesse God giue him that grace, yet doth he not sin of necessitie, that is, of compulsiō, but willingly. And the will hath sufficient libertie if by it selfe or the nature therof it be inclinable to the cōtrary of that which it chooseth, and doth of the owne accord choose that which it chooseth; although the same liberty bee gouerned and one way limited by God. Wherefore I am flat of Anselmus opinion, who saith: Although 
                  Lib. de concor. grat. & lib. arbitr. 
                  it bee of necessity that those things do come to passe which are foreknowne and predestinated; yet some things foreknowne and predestinated doe not come to passe by that necessitie which goeth before a thing, and causeth is, but by the same necessitie which followeth a thing. For God doth not cause, although he doth praedestinate them, by forcing the will, as by resisting it, but by leauing them in the power thereof. And I am also of Gaudentius his opinion; who saith: The Iewes 
                  Ser. 3. ad Neophy. 
                  were willing to doe that euill which they did. And verily, if they had bin vnwilling to doe it



they had not done it. And it is a grosse sinne, but to thinke that God, who is not onely good and righteous, but also goodnesse and righteousnesse it selfe, doth either command, or compel any thing to be done, which he condemneth when it is done. But that I may in a word fully deliuer my opinion, if it bee demanded, how the will of God carrieth it selfe to good or euill, I answere: that in a good act God carrieth himselfe positiuely. For first he determineth the euent of good, by willing effectually to worke it; and secondly, hee inwardly inclineth the will of the creature, to doe that good which it doth. Thirdly, he sometimes laieth a necessitie of immutabilitie on him that doth well, but yet it is ioyned with an exceeding freedome. After this sort the elect Angels doe necessarily obey God, yet not by constraint, but greatly coueting, and with all the strength of their will desiring it, not being thereunto compelled. In an euill act, I say that God carrieth himselfe priuatiuely; not by a logical, but a natural priuation foregoing the habit. For first he willeth that euill come to passe, not by doing it himselfe, but by willing not to



hinder it to be done by others. Secondly, he doth not inwardly incline the will to doe euill, but he forsaketh, and outwardly offereth obiects which are good in themselues. Thirdly, God laieth not on vs any necessitie, but a desertiō, or want of grace, to which being imposed, followeth the necessitie of sinning, not as the effect doth his cause, but as the defect doth him that forsaketh. And this I am resolued on, that Gods decree doth altogether order euery euent, partly by inclining and gently bending the will in all things yt are good; and partly by forsaking it in things that are euill: and yet the will of the creature left vnto it selfe, is carried headlong of the owne accord, not of necessitie in it selfe, but contingently that way which the decree of God determined from eternitie. We therefore (thankes be giuen vnto God) doe with all our hearts renounce the doting follies of the Stoickes and the Manichees.
            
            
               The fourth Crimination is,
               That wee doe teach, that the greatest part of mankinde is depriued of Christ and all sauing grace.
               
                  
                  Answere. 1.
               It might happily seeme a rigorous course that some should bee depriued of Christ, if so bee that they had neuer at any time nor any where receiued sauing grace. But all and euery one receiued holinesse and happinesse in Adam, together with abilitie to perseuere and remaine in the some holy and happie estate, if they had would. But Adam would not; but did of his owne accord cast away that grace which was bestowed on him by his Creator: for which being lost, it is a wonder, that all without exception are not damned. And therefore it may seeme the lesse strange to any one, if grace by Christ bee againe bestowed vpon one, and not vpon another.
               Secondly I answere, that wee doe acknowledge with glad mindes that Christ died for all (the scripture auerring so much): but we vtterly deny, that he died for all and euer one alike in respect of God, or, as well for the damned as elect, and that effectually on Gods part. For first let vs weigh well the words of Christ: I neuer knew you: depart from me yee workers of iniquitie. 
                  Matth. 7. 25


                  
Now to know with God is to acknowledge; and therefore, whom Christ neuer knew, hee neuer acknowledged for his. And those whom he hath not sometime acknowledged, he neuer bought or redeemed with the price of his bloud. And therefore well saith Gregorie: Not to know with God is to reiect. Againe, if al and euery one be effectually redeemed, al and euery one are reconciled vnto God. Because that the forgiuenesse of sinnes and the satisfaction for the same are inseparably ioyned together. Yea and Paul placeth Eph. 1. 7. & Col. 1. 14. redemption in the remission of sins, where he saith: By whom we haue redemption through his bloud, euen the forgiuenesse of sinnes. Very well therefore saith Prosper: As it is not sufficient for the renewing 
                  Lib. 1. resp. pro Aug. obiect. 9. 
                  of men, that Christ Iesus was borne man, vnlesse they bee renued also in the same spirit, whereof he was borne: so it is not sufficient for mans redemption that Christ Iesus was crucified, vnlesse wee die together and be buried with him in baptisme. Of these premises therfore I frame this assumptiō: But al are not reconciled vnto God, neither doe all receiue remission of sinnes: for then all



men were blessed; and it were not possible, Psal. 32. 1. for them to perish: which thing to affirme of all and euery one, is very grosse. Thirdly, Christ gaue himselfe that hee Tit. 2. 14. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . might
                     •
                   sanctifie vnto himselfe a people peculiar, that is, as a precious treasure and his owne gotten good selected and chosen from among other: therefore it was not Christs purpose, to giue himselfe for a 
                     •
                  ansome for all & euery one alike. Fourthlie, for whom redemption it ordained, to them al is giuen on Gods part the making of them sonnes by Christ: but the making of sonnes, or Adoption is not graunted to all and euery one, euen on Gods part. For Iohn. 1. 12. the power of the Adoption wherby a man is made of the child of wrath the child of God, is only giuen to those y• beleeue and De Correp. & grat. c. 9. apprehend Christ. They are (saith Augustine) the children of God, who are not as yet so vnto vs, and yet they are so vnto God; because that by beleeuing they should afterwardes bee so through the preaching of the Gospell: and yet before this was so, they were engrauen the children of God, by a stedfast and immutable stabilitie, in the register of their father. And againe there are some which in respect euen of some present or temporall



grace which they haue receiued, are said by vs i
                        •
                      bee the children of God, and yet are they not so vnto God. Fiftly: None are truely redeemed on Gods part, but they who are freed from sinne, both according to the power that it hath to cause damnation, and also according to the power that it hath to reigne in them. In this do the antient fathers agree: for Augustine saith: By this mediatour God sheweth that he 
                  De Corre

                     ct. in Ioh. 2. & 7. 7 And againe: Christ will haue no partaker in that which hee hath bought, but will possesse it wholly to himselfe, and to that end gaue hee so great a price, that hee might onely possesse the same. Isychius saith, Christ 
                  
                     
                        •
                     n Leuit. lib. 1. c. 23. In Psal. 64. 
                  who suffered for vs, hath freed vs from sinne and the bondage thereof. Remigius saith: Thou art the reconciler, thou art the reconcilement, and blessed shall they bee for whom thou shalt make reconciliation. Out of these I thus conclude: all and euery one are not redeemed according to both the aforesaid powers of sinne. For let vs



grant that on Gods part they are freed frō damnation: yet they are not in such measure indued with grace, as that sinne shall no more reigne in them. Christ therefore is but onely the halfe redeemer of these; and for that cause not a redeemer. Lastly, let vs diligently consider the iudgemēt of ancient writers. Ambrose saith: If thou beleeuest 
                  De fide ad Gratian. 
                  not, Christ came not downe for thee, Neither did he suffer for thee. Augustine saith: Euery one that is generated is damned, and no one is freed vnlesse he be regenerated. 
                  Ser. 14. de verb. Apost. & ser. 20. de verb. Apost. And againe: It is well said, I will haue mercie on whom I will haue mercie. For if the whole world being in thraldome, and in the power of sinne, and most iustly ordained to punishment, bee neuerthelesse in part by Gods mercie freed: who can say vnto God, why dost thou condemne the world? And againe: He that hath bought vs at so deere a price, will not that we whom he hath bought should bee 
                  Serm. 109. 
                  destroyed. God hath giuen a great price and bought those whō he quickneth. And again: Of whose mercie is it but of his who hath sent Iesus Christ into this world to saue sinners, 
                  Denat. & grat. cont. Pel. cap. 5. whom he hath both foreknowne and predestinated, and called, and iustified, and glorified.



Bernard saith: Christ needed none of 
                  Ser. 4. de natali. 
                  these: neither did hee any of these things in regard of himselfe, but rather in regard of the elect—:they were not directly the Iewes to whom he was sent, but the Elect for whom hee was sent. Haimo saith: Euen as by one man death & sin came generally to our condemnation: 
                  Comment. in Rom. c. 5. 
                  so by the one iustice of man, which is, of Christ, to all men elected and predestinated to eternall life came grace to the iustification of life. And againe: He tooke not away in the 
                  Ibid. 
                  elect onely originall, but also actuall sinnes: and therefore grace and the gift through grace did

Which happeneth,—partly by Gods election, through which the effect of Christs me, its is mercifully bestowed on some, and partly by the iust iudgement of God withdrawne from other some.
               
                  Obiect. I. Against this it is thus obiected: The Scripture affirmeth that Christ redeemed the world. Whereto I answer: That this word (world) in the writings of the Apostles doth not signifie both all and euery man that descended from Adam,


                  
but all nations in this last age of the world. God (saith Paul) was recōciling the world vnto him in Christ. What meaneth 1. Cor. 15. cap. 18. this word world in this place? Surely not all men of al ages, but the Gentiles which were to bee called after the ascension of Christ, as Paul plainly explaining his own minde sheweth, Rom. 11. 12. Wherefore if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their abundance be? And againe in the 15. verse: If the casting away of them, (that is, of the Iewes) be the reconciling of the world; what shall the receiuing be but life from the dead? In these very words he plainly sheweth, that the reconciliation of the world is the reconciliation of the Gentiles after the casting away of the Iewes. And hereby it is most manifest, that all the like places of Scripture, which many doe think to make for the vniuersall redemption of all and euery one, are to be vnderstood of some men to be called but of euery nation and countrie after the death of Christ. And hereunto also let vs ioyne the answere of Augustine: He calleth oftentimes euen the 
                  Tract. 87. in Ioan.


                  
                  Church it selfe by the name of the world
                        •
                      according vnto that, God was reconciling the world vnto himselfe in Christ: and againe, the Son of man came not to iudge the world, but that the world might be saued through him. And Iohn saith in his Epistle, Wee haue an aduocate with the Father Iesus Christ the iust, and hee is the reconciler of our sinnes, and not onely of ours, but also of the whole world. Therefore the whole world is the Church, and the whole world hateth the Church. Therefore the world hateth the world, the malignant world the reconciled world, the damned the saued, and the defited that which is cleansed. But this world, which God in Christ reconcileth vnto himselfe, and which by Christ is saued, and to which all sin is through Christ pardoned, is elected out of the malignant, damned, and defiled world. Rupertus saith: The world surely, which God

                  loued, we vnderstand to be mankinde, that is, the liuing and the dead: the dead, which in faith looked for his comming; the liuing, who should beleeue in him, whether they were of the Iewes or of the Gentiles. For so he saith without any distinction either of Iew or Gentile vniuersally, that euery one that beleeueth



in him shall not porish, but haue life euerlasting. And the common glosse expoundeth the world, those that be the elect of the world.
               
               
                  Obiect. II. Saint Paul saith, that God 
                  1. Tim. 2. 4. 
                  will that all men bee saued and come to the knowledge of the truth. I answere, first, that the place is not to be vnderstood, of al the posteritie of Adam, but properly of those which liue in the last age of the world. This I proue by cōferring of the like places, wherein Paul doth plentifullie shew his meaning. Act. 17. 30. And the time of this ignorance God regarded not, but

                  6. The mysterie which was hid since the world began and from all ages, is Now made manifest vnto the Saints. 27. To whō God would make knowne Christ—;whom we preach, admonishing euery man and teaching euery man, that we may present all men perfect in Christ Iesus. And in the second epistle to the Corinth. the 6. chap. and the



second verse, he expoundeth that place of Isaias, where it is said: In an acceptable time haue I heard thee, and in a day of saluation haue I helped thee, and I will preserue thee: and will giue thee for a couenant of the people that thou maist raise vp the earth,—that thou maist say to the prisoners, go
                        •
                      foorth; after this fashion: Behold, Now, saith hee, the accepted time, (that is, the time of the new Testament) behold Now the day of saluation. Saint Peter saith: Saluation 
                  1. Pet. 2. 20. 
                  ordained to bee declared in the last times: concerning which the Prophets which did prophecie of the grace which should afterward come to you, haue searched and inquired. And Christ himselfe saith most plainly of all, When I shall be lifted vp from 
                  Ioh. 12. 32. 
                  the earth, I will draw all things vnto me. I therefore grant, that God willeth that all should be saued: but that God both willeth, and that he hath Alwaies willed that all men in all ages should bee saued, I vtterly denie, neither hath Paul said so much: and among the ancient writers they which seeme to affirme so much, doe notwithstanding in these kinde of speeches doubtfully affirme it: I doe imagine



that it may with reason and religion bee beleeued:

               Secondly I answer: That God will that all men bee saued, that is to say, of those that are saued. So saith Augustine: Euen as it is said: that all shall be quickoned in 
                  Ep. 107 ad Vitalem. 
                  Christ, although very many be punished by eternall death: because all whosoeuer they are that doe receiue eternall life, doe not receiue it but in Christ: so is it said, that God will haue all men to be saued, although he will haue many not to be saued: because all who are saued, are not saued but by him willing it. And againe: When wee reade in the holie Scriptures, that God will haue all men to bee 
                  Enchir. ad Laur. c. 103. 
                  saued, although wee know assuredly that all

                     gate any thing from the omnipotent will of God: but thus to vnderstand that which is written, Who will haue all men to be saued, as if it should be said, that no man was saued, but hee whom God would haue to bee saued: not that there is no man whom he will not haue saued. Hay

                  what is the reason why all men are not saued. To which, answere must bee made, that that saying in the Psalm is true, He spake the word and they were made. In like manner he will saue all men who are saued, and who by his mercie desire to bee saued. For the Apostle put the whole for the part, as it is in the Gospell where the Lord saith, If I be lifted vp from the earth, I will draw all vnto me. For he hath not drawne neither doth hee draw all men vnto him, but All that are elect, and of all sortes, and nations.
               
               Thirdly I answer, that God will not haue euery one of euery kind, but the kindes of euery one to bee saued; that is to say, of euery estate and condition some. Augustine saith: This very saying, Who will 
                  Euchir. ad. Laur. c. 103 
                  haue all men to be saued, is so said, not because there is no man whom hee would haue damned, who would not doe any powerfull miracles among them, who hee saith would haue repented if hee had: but that wee by all men, may vnderstand euery sort of men, by what differences so euer distinguished, whether they be Kings or subiects, noble or ignoble, high or low, learned or vnlearned, strong or weake, witty, dull spirited or foolish, rich, poore or



meane men or women, infants or children, youths or yong men, middle aged men or old men, in all languages, in all trades, in all conditions, in all professions, in the innumerable variety of wills and consciences, and what other differences soeuer there is among men. These things saith hee, very truely and rightly, for this word, All, is sometime taken distributiuely, and then it signifieth euery seuerall and particular person: and Paul to the entent that hee might signifie 2. Thess. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 3 this, ioyneth the word euery one with the word all. It is also often taken collectiuelie, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and then it signifieth any, and not eueone: as when Christ is said to haue healed euery disease, that is, any disease. The Matth. 9. 35 double signification of this word Aristotle also obserued. This word All (saith he) is Pol. lib. 2. cap. 2. taken two waies, first for euery one—and secondly the word Al is vsed, when it doth not signifie euery one: It is plaine therefore that the word All hath a doubtfull 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Comment. ad Eph. c. 1. signification. And of this minde also is Saint Ierome: It is like vnto that (saith he) which is in the Psalme:—euery man is a lier. If euery man be a lier, then is he also a lier which speaketh it, and if hee bee a lier



which speaketh it, then is not that true which he speaketh, namely that euery man is a lier. But, if this saying be true, these words Euerie man doth lye, are (as I saide before) to bee vnderstood after this sort, A great part of men are liers. And the Apostle writeth elsewhere, Teaching euery mā: and again, Admonishing 
                  Comment. ad Rom. c. 5. 
                  euery man: not that he taught all men, (for how many are there yet at this day which haue neither heard of the Apostles doctrine, nor yet so much as his name?) but that hee should teach and admonish all that are in the Church. Sedulius also saith: Many 
                  In epist. ad Rom. 6. 5. 
                  and all in Paul are one.
               
               Fourthly, S. Paul speaketh in this place according to the charitable iudgement of Christians: and not according to the iudgement of secret and infallible certaintie. Like vnto this, is that also that he calleth the faithfull in seuerall Churches men elected; amongst whom there were many which afterward fell away from the faith. And yet is not the Apostle deceiued; for it is one thing to speake, according to his owne affection: and another thing to speake, as the matter is according as it is indeede. Augustine saith:



                  We ought so charitably to be affected, as to 
                  De Correp. & grat. c. 
                        •
                     5 
                  wish that all men be saued: as men that know not who appertaine to the number of those that are predestinated, and who doe not. And againe: We must as much as in vs hath, 
                  Cap. 1
                        •
                     . 
                  being vnable to distinguish those that are predestinated, from those that are not, desire that all men be saued, and vse sharpe correction vnto all with an entent to heale them that they perish not.
               
               Hence it appeareth what we ought to thinke of Damascene his opinion, who diuideth the will of God into his precedent and consequent will. He calleth that his precedent will, whereby God, as he that is absolutely good, willeth to bestow all good things, yea blessednes it selfe vpon the creature; and by this will hee affirmeth, that God willeth that all men should bee saued, and attaine vnto his kingdome: because hee made vs not to punish vs, but that he might make vs partakers of his goodnesse, as being good himselfe. But his consequent will is that, whereby for some certaine circumstances of the creature, he absolutely willeth this or that: and by this will, hee saith, that



God willeth that man should be damned for sinne, because he is inst. And indeede this distinction in it selfe is to be allowed, but that is not a very fit example, which hee hath set downe or alleaged, concerning his precedent will. For there seemeth not to bee in God such a will, or (as they Optatiua voluntar. vse to terme it) such a wishing will, whereby he will indefinitely and vpon condition, that all and euery man of all ages should bee saued. For first, it argueth a finite power and insufficiencie in him that willeth. For whatsoeuer any one desireth and earnestly willeth, that will be bring to passe, vnlesse hee be hindred. As for example: The Merchant desireth and earnestly willeth to saue his ware: but being forced by a tempest, to the entent that himselfe may escape, hee doth absolutely will to cast them into the sea. Yea indeede this kinde of will seemeth to argue weaknes, because God willeth that, which shall not come to passe. But you will say, that this will is conditionall; that is, that God will that they be saued, if they shall beleeue. And I say first, that the will of God stands doubtfull, vntill the condition bee fulfilled,



& that the first cause is by this meanes held in suspence by the second causes: moreouer there is giuen vnto men a free will either to beleeue or not to beleeue: that is, flexible and inclinable both waies, either by grace, or by nature: both which things are false, as I will afterwards shew. And therfore, this will is rather a humane will than a diuine. Heare what Anselmus saith: The will of God is taken foure manner of waies by the principall Doctors: first, for 
                  Lib. de volunt. Dei. 
                  the knowlddge of God: then for the will of the Saints, who will in charitie that euen the vniust should be saued: againe, for humane reason: and lastly for Gods Commandemēts. Secondly, this conditionall will seemeth idle and vnnecessarie, especially in him whose power is infinite; because if hee earnestly willed, hee would verily doe a thing, when he might without hindrance. Thirdly, Gods wil is not such concerning the Angels, whereby he willeth that all of them should be saued: therefore, it may well bee demanded, whether his will bee such concerning man. Fourthly, if God will that all men, as they are men, bee saued: in like manner hee will that all sinners,



as they are sinners, be damned; which is absurd. Fiftly, that will which cannot bee resisted, is absolute: but Gods Antecedent or first will cannot bee resisted: Rom. 9. 19. For there Paul speaketh of the will that goeth before all causes. Therefore, the precedent will is absolute. And this will I make manifest after another manner: the will of God is that some should beleeue and perseuere, and that othersome should bee forsaken either not beleeuing or not perseuering. You will aske me happely how I know this. I answere, by the euent. For as touching the euent some beleeue, and some doe not beleeue. But to beleeue and to perseuere is a certaine kind of good action; and on the contrarie not to beleeue, or not to perseuere is an euill action. And euery thing that is good, is, through the effectuall will of God; and so farre foorth as there is, or existeth that which is good, so farre foorth God willeth it, and maketh it to exist by willing it. And that euill, which commeth to passe, commeth to passe, God not hindring it; and because God will not hinder it, therefore consequently



it commeth to passe. Hereupon, it is certaine, that God willeth that some should beleeue, and perseuere vnto the end, and that othersome doe not so; yea euen without any condition: and no reason can be rendred, wherefore he willeth this. Therefore this will is both absolute and first: and therefore that vniuersall precedent will concerning the saluation of all and euery one in Christ, is counterfeite and fained. Sixtly, the ground of this opinion, is that foresaid place of Paul, which I haue alreadie shewed to be misunderstood. And yet, that place laieth not down vnto vs any conditional but an absolute will. For there it is first affirmed, that God will haue all men to be saued: afterwards, that he will haue all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, that is, vnto faith, because by applying faith to the word of God we acknowledge the truth. Where is now thē that condition of faith? Lastly, against Damascene I oppose Augustine: who to the Pelagians vrging this Hypog. lib. 6 cap. 8. place of scripture, God will that all men be saued, maketh a double answere: first hee denieth that it is not generally to bee



vnderstood of the vniuersalitie of men, and that by this argument: That which God willeth he effecteth: but hee doth not generally saue all men; therefore hee willeth not. Secondly, hee faith that the place is to be vnderstood of them which are actually saued: because all men which are saued, are saued by the will of God. Againe, I oppose against him Prosper also, who saith: If the will of God concerning 
                  Respon. pro August. lib. 1 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 8. 
                  the vniuersall sauing of mankinde, and the calling them to the knowledge of the truth, is to bee affirmed so indifferent throughout all ages, as that it shall be said to ouerpasse no man in what place soeuer, Gods impenetrable and deepe iudgements receiue a great blow. And againe: Wee cannot say that there is the calling of grace, whereas there is as yet no regeneration of the mother the Church. And againe: Hee forbad the Apostles to preach the Gospell vnto some people; and now as yet he suffereth some people to liue out of his grace. Also I oppose Thomas Aq

euery thing that is good to all, that is eternall life: and therein hee is said to hate and reiect them. To conclude, I oppose against Him Hugo de sanct. vict. Who will (saith he) that all men be saued, according 
                  Annot. in 1. Tim. cap. 2. 
                  to Ambrose, if they themselues will. But are there not many who would be saued, and yet are not saued?—or thus, he offereth grace vnto all, by which, if they will, they may bee saued. But how is this solution true, are there not and haue there not bin many, which neuer heard so much as a word of preaching?
               
               
                  Obiect. III. That which euery one is bound to beleeue is true: but euery one is bound to beleeue that he is effectuallie redeemed by Christ: therefore it is manifest that euery one euen the reprobate is effectually redeemed by the death of Christ. Whereto I answere: that the termini or parts of the proposition are to be distinguished: that which euery one is bound to beleeue, is true according to the intention of God that bindeth: but it is not alwaies true according to the euent. Ionas preached, and therefore hee was bound to beleeue, Yet fortie daies, and Niuiue shall bee destroyed: but this was not



true according to the euent. The assumption also must bee distinguished. Euerie one in the Church, by Gods commandement (Beleeue the Gospell) is bound to beleeue that he is redeemed by Christ: yea euen the reprobate as well as the elect, but yet notwithstanding in a diuers and different respect. The elect is bound to beleeue that by beleeuing hee shall bee made partaker of election: the Reprobate, that by not beleeuing hee may bee made vnexcusable, euen by the intention of God. For God sometimes giueth a commandement not that it should be actually done, but that men may bee tried, that they performe outward discipline, and that they may be conuicted of their naturall infidelitie, and bee made vnexcusable of all their sinnes before God in the last iudgement. For thus I distinguish of Gods commaundement: there is a certaine commaundement of obedience, the performance whereof God willeth in all: hither are referred the commaundements of the morall law. There is also a certaine commaundement of triall, as the commaundement of sacrifysing Isaac: 
                  Gen. 22. 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  


                  
whereas God willeth not the act it selfe, but onlie the manifestation of obedience. And therefore God must not bee said to mocke men, if by the word preached hee doe outwardly call those, whom hee will not haue to be saued: for by this meanes hee sheweth vnto them the riches of his grace, and declareth that they perish by their owne fault, because they will not receiue saluation offered. But you will say they cannot: I confesse as much, but that inabilitie whereby they cannot, is voluntarie, and borne together with vs, not infused into vs by God: and therefore it cannot be excused. Very well therefore saith Bernard: The master knew well, that the weightinesse of the commandement exceeded 
                  Ser. 40. in Cant. 
                  the strength of man: but he thought i
                        •
                      expedient euen in this, that it put them in remembrance of their owne insufficiency,—Therefore by commaunding things impossible, hee makes not men s
                        •
                     arners from the trueth, but humbleth them that euery mouth may bee stopped. So saith Augustine de grat. & lib. arbit. cap. 43. Secondly, I answere: that that which euery one is bound to beleeue



is true, vnlesse any one shall by his owne vnbeleefe hinder himselfe; this doth the reprobate by his owne inborne infidelitie. Thirdly I answer, that the argument doth follow twice affirmatiuely in both propositions. For the termini or parts of the proposition are thus to bee turned: That is true, that euery one is bound to beleeue, but euery one is bound to beleeue that he is redeemed by Christ. Therfore that is true.
               
                  Obiect. IIII. The fathers which beleeued aright doe affirme that Christ redeemed all & the whole world. Ans. Whereas they write that Christ redeemed all men and the world, their meaning is, that hee did it according vnto sufficiencie, and the common cause, and common nature of all, which Christ did take vpon him: and not effectually on Gods part. This very thing doth Prosper make plaine: All men (saith he) are rightly said to be redeemed, in respect of the one nature of all, and the one

                     . 
                  cause of all, which our Lord did truely take vpon him: and yet all are not deliuered from captiuitie: The proprietie of redemption



                  without doubt belongeth vnto them for whom the prince of the world is sent abroad:—whose death was not so bestowed for mankind, as that it should also pertaine vnto the redemption of them, who were not to bee regenerated. And againe he saith: Our Sauiour may fitly be said to be crucified for the 
                  Ad Capit. Gall. cap 9. 
                  redemption of all the world, both in respect that he truely tooke vpon him the nature of man, and also in respect of the common or generall perdition in the first man: and yet he may be said to be crucified only for those, vnto whom his death was auaileable. Moreouer the fathers speake of the vniuersalitie, and of the world of beleeuers. So saith he that is the Author of the calling of the Gentils. The people of God (saith he) haue their 
                  Lib. 1. cap. 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   
                  fulnesse?
               
               And thus much for the efficacie and greatnesse of Christs death: Now as concerning grace: I say, that that is diuerslie distinguished. For first, it is either restrayning, or renewing. The restrayning grace is that, whereby the inbred corruption of the hart, is not therby vtterly diminished and taken away, but in some is restrained more, in some lesse, that it breake not violently



forth into action: and it is giuen onely for a testimonie vnto man, and to preserue order amongst men in a politique societie: and this kind of grace is generall, that is, belonging to all and euery man, amongst whome some doe exceed othersome in the giftes of ciuill virtues: and there is no man, in whom God doth not more or lesse restraine his naturall corruption. Now renewing or Christian grace (as auncient writers doe vsuallie call it) is that whereby man hath power giuen him to beleeue and repent, both in respect of will, and power: and it is vniuersall in respect of those that beleeue, but indefinit in respect of all and euerie man. Thus we teach, thus we beleeue.
               Secondly, Grace is either naturall, or De praed. sanct. cap. 5. supernatural: as Augustine himselfe teacheth. Naturall grace is that, which is bestowed on man together with nature: and this is either of nature perfect or corrupt. Perfect, as the image of God, or righteousnesse bestowed on Adam in his creation. This grace belonged genenerally vnto all, because we all were in Adam: and whatsoeuer hee receiued that



was good, he receiued it both for himsel
                     •
                   and his posteritie. The grace of nature corrupted is a natural inlightning (whereof Iohn speaketh: He enlightneth euery man that commeth into the world) yea and euery Ioh. 1. 9. naturall gift. And these gifts truly by that order which God hath made in nature, are due and belonging vnto nature. But that Grace which is supernaturall, is not due vnto nature, especially vnto nature corrupted, but is bestowed by speciall grace, and therefore is speciall. This the ancient writers affirme. Augustine saith: Nature is common to al, but not grace: and he only acknowledgeth De verb, Apost. ser. 11. a twofold grace; namely that common grace of nature, wherby we are made men: and Christian grace, wherby in Christ we are againe borne new mē. And hee is of opinion, that some that doe not beleeue in Christ, do not sinne: which is a thing notwithstanding very vngodlie and vntrue, if grace bee as generall as nature. Let vs well weigh his words: In that he hath (saith he) added: Now they are 
                  Tract. 89. in Iohan. 
                  inexcusable for their sinne: it may mooue men to aske: whether those vnto whom Christ hath not come nor spoken may haue any excuse



for their sinne.—To this question according to my vnderstanding I make answer: that they cannot bee inexcusable for euery sinne which they haue committed, but for this sinne that they haue not beleeued, vnto whom Christ did not come, and vnto whom hee did not speake. But they are not in this number vnto whom hee hath spoken in his disciples, and by his disciples, which he also now doth. For he came vnto the Gentils by his Church,—It remaines for vs to demaund, whether they can haue this excuse, which haue bin or are preuented by death, before Christ came in his Church to the gentiles, and before they heard his Gospell. I answere that without doubt they may, but they cannot therefore escape damnation: for whosoeuer haue sinned without the law shall also perish without the law. Againe hee saith: Onely grace distinguisheth 
                  Enchir. c. 99 
                  those that are saued, from those that, are damned, who were enwrapped in one lumpe of corruption by one common cause from the beginning. Chrysostome saith: The grace of God commeth vnto euery one, but it remaineth

                  with them who doe worthily fulfill those things which are in their power: departing quickely from them, which doe not wel behaue



themselues: neither doth it at all come vnto those, who doe not so much as begin to turne vnto the Lord. Gregorie saith: The Gentiles did not any way worship God, neither shewed they any signe or token of any good worke▪ for indeede they were 
                  But if grace be vniuersall, there had alwaies been some Church among the Gentiles, although secret and hidden: for it is not likely that all had cast away grace or that they had vsed it

And afterwards he saith: When our redeemer came he so receiued the calling of grace, as that there was not before in it the life of prophecie. And againe: Teachers holding their tongues, the diuels goe into their place: because none doe perish by the silence of the pastours, but they who are not predestinated vnto eternall life.

                     ••
                  en: and to this end, I doe thus briefly propound it.
               First, God created all and euery man in 
                     
                        〈◊〉

                     •
                   the fall.
               Thirdly, because he is by nature gentle and good, he doth 
                     •
                  eriooshe will that all men after the fall should be saued, and come to the knowledge of the truth: and therefore willeth to giue all the furthe
                  
                     •
                  ances both of nature and grace that they may be saued; but yet indefinitely, if they themselues shall beleeue. This will of God (they say) is predes
                     •
                  ination, and the same with the writtē Gospell: The rule of this wil is; Whosoeuer shal beleeue shal be saued; He that wil not beleeus shall be d

                     mned▪
                  
               
               
                  
Lastly, Election is according to the foreknowledge of future faith, (which notwithstanding may be lost vtterly for a time, as some say; or finallie and for euer, as some others will) and reprobation is according to the foreknowledge of infidelitie, or the contempt of the Gospel.
               This platforme is in very truth (so far as, I can iudge of is by the scriptures) a meere inuention of mans wit: which will appeare by the manifold errours therein contained.
               First, by this platforme or groundwork Error 1. there followeth a certaine vniuersall reprobation, and that a very absurd and strange one. For if there bee (as they doe affirme) an vniuerfall election, whereby God willeth that all men shall be saued in definitely, if they doe beleeue: he willeth also by the like reason that all and each one should be dāned if they do not beleeue. But this reprobation is no where to be found in the scriptures. Yea hence refolloweth that God being alike affected to all, and seriously willing the conuersion and saluation of all, doth neither chuse nor refuse any man.
               
                  
From hence also it followeth, that God Error 2. hath in vaine propounded with himselfe the supreme & absolute end of his counsels, which is to communicate his goodnesse in true selicitie euen to enery man. For if we consider the cuent, he doth not communicate his goodnesse and eternall life vnto very many, which is otherwise than he purposed, namely vnto those that are damned. But we are in no case to say that the supreme end of Gods counsels, either haue an vncertaine euent, or are in vaine propounded.
               Thirdly, this platforme attributed vnto God a certaine ordered and fitted will, Error 3. which doth wholy depend on mans will. Thou saist that God willeth that all men whatsoeuer should bee saued by Christ. Very well: Tell me therefore why they are not saued. They themselues will not, thou first. Yea wis. What is this but to set the creature in the throne of almightie God the Creator, against the order of nature and of all causes? For the first cause, which indeede is Gods will, ought to order and dispose the act of the second cause. And therefore wee must not giue



vnto God a will that is ordered by the will of the creature; especially considering that all order in heauen and in earth whatsoeuer proceedeth from him. That which ordereth all things, is ordered of none. Moreouer, men after this sort are elected of themselues, by receiuing of Gods grace being offied, by the assistance of common grace: and are also reiected of themselues by refusing of grace offred: and men themselues shall be the makers and framers of their owne election and reprobation: and God who chuseth is not so much to be praised, as the men that do receiue and embrace the blessing offered.
               Fourthly, this platforme laies downe a determinate spreknowledge about the Error 4. euill of fault, without any decree going before concerning the euent of the fault; which cannot be. A definite foreknowledge is not the cause of that thing which is to be, but the thing which shal be is the cause of the foreknowledge thereof. For the thing which shall be followes not the foreknowledge of it, but foreknowledge followeth the thing which shall be, as Iustinus


                  
taught. For God doth first decree a Quaest. 58. Orthodox. thing as touching the euent: then afterwards hee doth foreknew by his definite foreknowledge that it shall be. And Anselme: In that (saith he) a thing is said to be foreknowne, it is by that pronounced that 
                  Depraed. sanct. c. 14. 
                  it shall be. And Augustine before his time affirmed, That God doth foreknow that which shall be. Hence it followeth that a thing must oxist with God, before it can be precisely and definitly knowne before. And euery thing existeth and is, because God did will and decree to doe it if it be good, or to suffer it to be done if it be euill; haue respect alwaies to the good that is ioyned with it. Vnlesse wee shall hold and grant this, it will follow that something hath being of it selfe, that is, that something is a God. Therefore the existencie or being of things doth not goe before, but out of all doubt followes the decree of God. For first of al, there is a foteknowledge, or (as it pleaseth others) a knowledge Scientia intuitiua. of beholding, whereby God beholdeth and seeth what is possible to bee, and what not: Then followeth the decree either of Gods operation, or of his voluntarie



permission, and consequently of the euent of the thing. And this decree being once laid down, the definitiue foreknowledge is conceiued, whereby it is knowne what shall come to passe infallibly.
               The fifth desect in this platforme is, that it teacheth that Christ for his part Error 5. hath redeemed and reconciled all and euery man to God, and that very many of them for all that as touching the euent are damned, which is very absurd. For if this were so, sinne, Satan, death and hell should be more mightie than Christ the Redeemer, and (as Augustine saith) Vitio humano vincitur Deus: God is ouercome by mans sinne. If thou wilt say that God is De cor. & grat. cap. 7. not ouercome; yet I say, and that according to this platforme, that he is altered: for hee hath decreed and seriously willed to saue all men, and yet not withstanding, another sentence being giuen, he willeth to destroy those which will not incline and bend themselues to this counsell.
               This platforme maketh sauing grace (which indeed is supernaturall) to be altogether Error 6. vninersall. But this opinion (to speake no hardlier of it) is a plausible deulse



of mans braine. For first of all hereby the speciall couenant made with Abraham, and the greatnesse of Gods metcies towards the Gentiles is abolished: And there is no mysterie of the vocation of the Gentiles, if all and euery particular man were by certaine meanes called vnto Christ from the beginning; For those, which shall by the helpe of common grace, which they shall receiue, giue assent vnto God calling them, whether it bee by extraordinary instinct, or by the ministerie of the word preached; they shall bee accounted among the members of the Church, and shal belong to the speciall couenant of the Gospell. Moreouer if the first grace bee vniuersall, it is either faith actually or in power. For without faith it is impossible to please God, and to attaine saluation. But actuall saith is not common to all. The power of faith is double, the first is that whereby thou hast receiued power to bee able to beleeue if thou wilt. But this is not sufficient vnto saluation: because now after Adams fall free will in spirituall things is wanting, especially in the conuersion of a sinner: and



therefore further grace is required whereby a man may he able to will to beleeue; No man can come to Christ but

Not by merit, because there is no merit before faith; and we do nothing acceptable vnto God before wee haue faith. Augustine: Thou bringest in a kind of men, which can please God without the f

not, refuse and despise it: and to say that God hath giuen vnto men no other grace, then that against which the flesh or peruerse will may preuaile in all men, and against which it doth preuaile indeede in the greatest part of mankind, because God will not restraine it.

also that the order of iustice should be manifested in others. Isidore: Spirituall grace Sent. lib. 2. cap. 5. & 6. is not distributed to all, but is only giuen to the elect. Againe: It is giuen to him, because he is euill that would be good: another neither willeth, neither is it giuen him that he might be good. Cameracensis: Although God be an vniuersal agent ouer all, so as that

Finally Augustine and almost al the Scholemen make two kindes of infidelitie, the one negatiue in those which neuer heard the Gospell: the other priuatiue in those that refuse and contemne the message, which they haue heard of Christ. And it is to be noted that by this distinction they doe consesse that God hath not vouchsafed so much as an outward calling to euery man.

                  men are named for a part of men. The heads of the nations Cain, Cham, Esan, &c. knew the promised Messiah, but those which came after knew him not, neither had they the meanes how to know him. So saith Isaias: Me haue they not knowne, of me haue 
                  Jsai. 52. 66. 
                  they not heard. The nations also next adioyning to the Iewes peraduenture heard somthing and had Proselytes, but the nations a fat off seated in the vttermost parts of the earth had no affaires with the Iewes, and no Proselytes. And therefore it is false which some affirme; to wit, that the chusing of the people of Israel was onely a kind of greater curtesie shewed to this nation, or a more gentle entreating of it, and no peculiar and diuers fauour, whereby hee shewed himselfe to be their father and redeemer onely. And to make or maintaine a hidden and inuisible Church among the Gentiles before the comming of Christ, is altogether to contend against y• word. God is only knowne in Iudah. The Israelites onely are called my

                  Obiect. II. There is infolded in Gods prouidence that care of God touching all those things which concerne the blessednesse of man. But the Gentiles knew this prouidence of God, and that his goodnes was so great, that hee would passe by nothing which might make for the happinesse and saluation of man. Therefore the Gentiles did after a sort, obscurely and by an infolded knowledge know the doctrine concerning the redemption of mankind. Answer: This faith of things vnknowne is a 
                     ••
                  cere siction. For faith of the owne nature is a certaine knowledge. Moreouer, although the generall doe include in it selfe the species or kinds, and the whole his members, yet hee which knoweth the generall and the whole, doth not by and by know all the kinds and parts thereof. The mind may so know the generall, that yet for all that it may in the meane time bee ignorant of the speciall kinds thereof. Wee must therefore beware of the Schoolemens opinion, who



say that saluatiō was giuen before Christs comming, for the implicite or infolded faith concerning the redeemer in generall, namely when men did beleeue that there is a God, and that hee is a rewarder and the giuer of all gifts which concerne the good either of soule or bodie, especially the remedie of sinne: But, this is nothing else, then to imagine a certaine sauing faith & Church, which hath no word of God at all either written or any other way reuealed. Furthermore, this is to accuse Paul of falsehood who teacheth the 1. Cor. 1. 21. contrarie in these words. Seeing the world by wised

Chrysostome: Grace is shed abroad ouer all: it passeth by and disdayneth neither Iew, nor Grecian, nor Barbarian, nor Soythian, it is alike affected vnto all, it sheweth it selfe gentle vnto all, it calleth all with equall honour; and lee those, who neglect the helpe of grace, ascribe this their blindnesse vnto themselues.

               Thirdly, the fathers speake of the vniuersall aptnesse, whereby mans will being by Gods ordinarie dispensation preuented and helped by the holy Ghost, may beleeue and bee conuerted: which notwithstanding, a stone, stocke, or beast cannot. Augustine: Apossibilitie to haue faith

                  De gen. contra Manich. lib. 1. cap. 3. 
                  the nature of men; but to haue faith, is the grace of the faithfull. Augustine: This difference there is betwixt wicked men and the diuels, that men though they be exceedingly

               Now as concerning Christian grace, whereby a will to bee conuerted, and to beleeue actually in Christ is giuen vnto men, The fathers haue not so much as dreamed, that it is common vnto all, and euery one: which notwithstanding some are not For they say that God hath giuen euery

                  Error 7. This platforme teacheth that Gods foreknowledge of our faith and iusidelitie is the rule of predestination; which is vtterly false. For first of all, the very will is a rule vnto it selfe, and the diuine counsels. Ephes. 1. 5. 11. We were predest

Thirdly, the foreknowledge of faith and infidelitie doth not extend it selfe so farre as predestination, which belongs vnto all men whatsoeuer, many of whom notwithstanding neuer

Againe: Lest any man should say,



My faith or some such like thing, doth distinguish me from other men, the teacher of the Gentiles meeting with such conceits asketh, What thou hast that thouhast not receiued, and of whom but of him, who distinguisheth thee from him, to whō he hath not giuen that which he hath giuē to thee.

For God doth foresee nothing which is good in any, besides that which hee himselfe of his pleasure will first make. And what is the cause why he foreseeth faith in one man rather than in another? but onely because it is his will to giue one man faith, and not an other. Lastly, th
                     •
                   rule is vncertaine, for faith, as appeareth by this platforme, may bee vtterly lost: and therefore the thing ruled, to wit, predestination is made uncertaine.



This a certaine Author plainly confesseth in his exposition of the epistle to the Romanes: where he teacheth vnaduisedly that Gods decree may be changed, and that election and reprobation haue recourse one to another: because (as he saith) they depend vpon the condition of faith and infidelitie.
               Furthermore, this platforme teacheth that true and sauing faith, may perish and Error

                     . be asked: what the rock is? what is meant by building on the rocke? and what is that which is promised to those which are built vpon it? The rocke is either faith it self, or Christ apprehended by faith. Chrysostome: Vpon this rocke: that is (saith he) vpon the faith of confession. Againe: He setteth 
                  Homil. in Matth. 55. & Psal. 32. 
                  our feete vpon the rocke, that is, vpon faith: for faith in Christ
                        •
                      may well be said to be that which cannot bee broken. Againe: Christ being wise hath built his house, that is,

                  his Church vpon a rocke, that is, vpon the



fortitude of faith, or a strong faith. Now if faith be a rock, it remaineth constant and immoueable. To be built vpon the rock, is to perceiue the doctrine of the Gospel, to embrace Christ our Sauiour with a true faith, and to cleaue fast to him with the heart. For the Cori
                     •
                  thians are said to bee Pauls building, because he brought them to the faith. And the Ephesians are said to be built vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets; because Paul came and preached vnto them the Gospell of peace. The certaintie and firmnesse of the doctrine of the Gospell may also bee called a Rocke. Epiphanius: They shall not preuaile against the rocke, that is 
                  Lib. haer. 74. 
                  to say, against the truth. Hilarie: This is thy blessed rocke of faith, which Peter hath 
                  De Trin. l. 3 
                  confessed with his mouth. Augustine: Vpon this rocke which thou hast confessed, I will build my Church. Now no man can be built vpon the confession and vpon the truth, but by faith. Hence I doe conclude thus: Those that are built vpon the rocke cannot fall away vtterly: but those which truely beleeue are built vpon the rocke: therefore those which t
                     •
                  uly beleeue,



doe not vtterly and whollie fall away. Thirdly, the promise made to them that are built vpon the rocke is, that the gates of hell shall not preuaile against them. From hence it followeth necessarilie, that the Diuels can but make a slorish, and shew their strength and power against the faith, and that they

Hence it is that in ye same place he speaketh after this sort: If thou makest warre with mā, thou shalt, it may bee, ouercome, or perhaps thou shalt bee ouercome: but no might can ouercome the Church. Furthermore: The Church 
                  Hom. 25. in Gen. 
                  is farre stronger than the earth, yea and stronger than heauen. Againe: Faith in God 
                  In 7. cap. Ioh is a certaine secure anchor. Gregorie: Because the light of the elect is not extinguished by temptation, wee doe not say there is a night made but an euening; namely because temptation doth oftentimes hide the light of righteousnesse in the hearts of the elect, but it doth not put it quite out: it makes it as it were twinkle and looke wanne, but it doth not extinguish it.

                  seede of faith hidden in thee: though the leaues bee blowne downe with the temptors winde, yet the roote is fresh.
               
               Second reason: Matth. 6. 13. Leade vs not into temptation, &c. that is, doe not vtterly forsake vs and deliuer vs vp to Satan. Augustine: God leadeth a man into 
                  De temp. serm. 36. 
                  temptation, when he suffers him to be tempted,



that hee may trie him, and not destroy him—: And he deliuereth from euill, when he suffers vs not to bee tempted beyond our power. Gregorie: The grace of the holie 
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Ioh. l. 39. 
                  Ghost qualifies the temptations of the aduersarie by dispensation, that those which may be may but scorch with their heate, and not burne vp with their fire. Hence I thus reason: Whatsoeuer wee aske according to Gods will, it shall be giuen vs: but wee aske according to Gods wil, that we may not be vtterly forsaken in temptation: for our Aduocate taught vs so to pray. Therfore that wee bee not vtterly forsaken in temptation, shall be giuen of God. Now whom God doth not vtterly forsake, he doth not vtterly fall away. And this Christ taketh for granted in the elect: Matth. 24. vers. 24. So as that, if it were possible, they should deceiue the very elect.
               
               Third reason: If there be a totall or vtter falling away from a true faith, then is there also required a second ingrasting into Christ, and consequently a seale of the second ingrafting, baptizing anew, that is to say, a
                     •
                  abaptisme: for so often as we are borne againe, we are to be baptized.



This is Augustines ground: As the 
                  Tract. in Ioh. 11. c. 1
                        •
                     
                   
                  carnall generation is one, neither can a man enter into the wombe againe: euen so is spirituall regeneration: for we are once borne, and we are also once borne againe. Therefore also it is requisite, that the sacrament of regeneration bee once receiued. If it chance to fall out by sinne, that some are weakened who are regenerated, they haue neede of cure by repentance, and not by baptisme. But those that doe vtterly or wholly fall away from faith and grace, are the second time to be ingrafted into Christ: and consequently, they are not once regenerated but again: and therefore they are oftner than once to be baptized.
               Fourth reason: 1 Ioh. 3. 9. Whosoeuer is borne of God committeth not sinne, because his seede remaineth in him. We must here marke that he saith his seede remaineth in him, that is to say, that it doth not depart nor vanish away; And this seede is the very word of God, which remaineth in vs by saith, and doth not remaine, saith being vtterly lost. This seede also is immortall, because it will neuer perish, if it be truly sowne in our hearts.
               
                  
A fist reason is taken out of the sixt to the Romans, Propositiō. If Christ hauing once died cannot die any more, then wee which are his members being dead together with him, shall not die any more in sinne. Assumptiō. But Christ hauing once died cannot die any more. Conclusion Therefore we which are his members shall not die any more in sinne. The proposition is in the eight verse: and hath a manifest ground. For by the vertue of the mysticall communion, which is had with Christ by faith, his spirituall life, which cannot perish, flowing into his members, maketh them in like manner that they die no more in sinne. The Assumption is in the 9. and 10. verse; the conclusion in the eleuenth. Moreouer, those which are the members of Christs bodie, shall grow vp vnto a perfect man: Eph: 4. 12. 13. and 1. Ioh. 2. 29. but all those which haue a true faith, are members of Christs bodie, therefore those which haue a true sauing faith shall grow vp vnto a perfect man: and therefore those which doe truely beleeue shall not perish but obtaine saluation.
               For the better vnderstanding of this



doctrine, two things must be sought for; first, whence it is that faith perisheth not? Answer: If wee consider faith by it selfe, that is, in the owne nature, it may perish and be lost; but if we consider the confirming grace, which God hath promised to them that bleeue, sauing faith doth not perish. It is by reason of the second grace freely promised, that the first grace doth not perish. To you it is giuen for Christ, 
                  Phil. 1. 39. 
                  that ye should not onely beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake. One of these (saith Augustine) belongs vnto the beginning, the other to the ende: but both are Gods gift, because both are giuen. A Christian mans beginning is to beleeue in Christ, and the best end hee can make is to suffer for Christ. Ier. 32. 40. I will make an euerlasting couenant with them, that I will neuer depart from them, to doe them good (loe the euerlasting forgiuenesse of sinnes) and I will put my feare in their harts, that they shall not depart from mee (behold the perseuerance of faith, and regeneration that shall neuer be lost) Phil. 1, 6. He that hath begun this good worke in you will finish it vnto the end.

                   is either the first, or second. The first, is the free fauour of God who embraceth those that are his being in Christ vnto euerlasting life. From this grace the faithfull are said to fall after this fashion. As soone as they haue committed some haynous sinne against the law of God, they doe grieuously offend him: God being offended changeth the effects



of grace, into ye effects of a certain hatred, not against the faithfull themselues, but against their sinnes; and this both within, and without. Within, when hee maketh them to feele an accusing conscience, & witnessing that God is displeased, and that they are made guiltie of death by their sinne. Without, when they taste of Gods anger against them in the outward chastiseme

                  in Christs word is verily his disciple: so he that doth not fall away, but abides a sheepe, is verilie a sheepe. Rom. 8. 35. Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? Rom. 10. 29. The gifts and calling of God are (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               Second grace is either imputed or inherent: imputed is in iustification, a part whereof is remission of sinnes. And this remaineth and shall foy euer remaine sure as touching sinnes passed. That saying of the Schoolemen is most true: Sinnes once forgiuen continue so alwaies. But when that any faithful man shall fall grieuously, the pardon of that fall is granted in Gods decree; notwithstanding no pardon is actually giuen of God, nor receiued of mā vntill he doe repent: yea if he should neuer repent (which notwithstanding is impossible) he should be damned as being guiltie of eternall death by this offence. For there is no pardon of any new sinne, without a new act of faith and repentance.
               Inherent grace, is either faith, or the gift which followeth faith; In sauing



faith we must consider, the act, and the habit. The act of faith is the very action of 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . apprehending, or an vnfained apprehension of Christ. Now this faith may be lost according to some act: The very habit also or power of faith, may in it selfe bee lost; but by reason of confirming grace faith doth not perish as touching the essence thereof, but it is lesned and abated according to some degree. And hence it followeth that our communion with Christ may bee diminished, but that our vnion cannot be dissolued. There remained in Dauid after his fall, the seed of true faith and regeneration: as appeareth by his words, Psal. 51. 11. Take not thy holy spirit from me. It is also the iudgement of the Greg. lib. 25 in lob. & in Eleb. Homil. 15. Tertull. lib. de Persec. Chrysoft. hom. 2

And againe: The fitting and mouing of the spirit may be thus vnderstood.

it neuer forsaketh their hearts that are vpright. But as touching the vertue of prophecie, the eloquence of doctrine, and working of miracles, it is sometimes present with the elect, and sometimes it withdrawes it selfe.
               
               The Schoolemen alledge Augustine to the contrary opinion, where hee saith, De cor. & grat. cap. 6. & 8. 
                  That doubtlesse if the man which is renewed and iustified doe fall backe by his owne will vnto an euill life, he cannot say I haue not receiued; because he hath by his owne free will vnto euill, lost the grace of God which hee did receiue. And againe: That God doth not giue the gift of perseuerance vnto some of his 
                  Cap 9. 
                  children whom he did regenerate in Christ, and to whom hee gaue faith, hope, and loue. But he speaketh not these things of those which are indeede the sonnes of the promise, but of those which are so called of vs, and which beare the name and profession of sonnes. Furthermore, he speaketh of such as haue faith and loue in opinion and imagination, and truely also as

                     •
                  or Augustine in the same place hath so expounded his meaning: We must beleeue that some of the

                  begin to liue, and for a time faithfully and iustly in the faith that worketh by loue, and afterwards fall—. Thirdly, he speaketh of faith and loue as they are imperfect vertues, and as it were lately sprung vp: and not as they are sound, perfect, and true, to wit, as touching the truth of their essence. So Augustine: Loue is sprung vp within thee, but it is not yet persi

                  Ibid. cap. 24 
                  and which springeth vp in euery one, is lost and repaired, before it be strengthened and made perfect. And indeed for the manifesting of the truth of faith and loue there is required perseuerance, by which it might bee knowne that these and such like vertues haue taken deep roote in the heart, and are grounded vpon an earnest and constant affection, that they may neuer be ouercome of temptations.
               
                  Obiect. I. Sin and the grace of the holy spirit cannot stand together. Ans. This is true of the sinne that ra
                     •
                  gneth, or which is committed with full consent of will, but the regenerate do not sinne with a whole



or full will. And I lay this foundation of this our iudgement. In tentation we must consider two things, the beginning or ground, and the degrees. The ground is our owne concupiscence, that is, our inbred corruption. The subiect thereof is the whole man, but especially the faculties of mans soule, the mind, will, and affections. And in these it doth immediatly exist and reigne alone before a sinner bee conuerted. And a man being not regenerated, be he what he will be, he is flesh euery iot of him. But after that a man is regenerated, the flesh is no more alone, or seuered by it selfe, but mixed with the spirit, and the spirit with the flesh: although both these qualities remaine as touching nature distinct in one subiect: as in the twilight the light doth not appeare alone, but with darkenesse, and darkenesse is not alone but with the light. And the man that is regenerated is not onely flesh, nor onely spirit, nor flesh in one part, and spirit in another, but the whole man is flesh in euery part, and the whole man is spirit in euery part. And because those things which are contrarie



cannot consist together in the highest degrees, therefore albeit the whole man bee flesh, yet he is not flesh in the highest degree, nor spirit in the highest degree: but in remisse and lower degrees, partly flesh, and partly spirit: as luke-warme water is remissely and indifferentlie colde thoroughout, and remissely also hot thoroughout. Hence it followeth that concupiscence may exist and bee with the grace of the holy spirit, so that it beare not rule. The degrees of tentation are, as Iames teacheth, in number sine. Iam. cap. 1. 14. 15. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
               
               The fi
                     〈◊〉
                  , Abstraction or drawing away, when the mind receiueth a thought cast into it about the committing of euill, and by this meanes suffers herselfe to bee drawne away frō her duty to other things.
               The second is inescation or entising, when the mind conceiueth a morose 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . thought for the committing of sinne together with a certaine delectation of the affection: as when fishes delight themselues with the bait hanging vpon the hooke. Thus farre all Diuines think a regenerate man may come; and it is most certaine. For hence it is that Paul complaineth



that hee was held captiue of Rom. 7. 23. sinne.
               The third degree is conception, namely 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . when there is a will, consent and a purpose to commit euill. And when corruption doth come thus farre, there bee some that say that all repentance and faith is driuen out and gone: but not truely. There is indeed in the vnregenerate in whom sinne reigneth, a full consent: but in the regenerate, in whom the flesh and the spirit are two contrarie foundations of actions, the consent is more remisse and vnperfect: for they doe so will, as that they nill, and so nill as that they will. As Paul hath taught by his owne example.
               The fourth degree is birth of sinne, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . when after consent an euill is actually committed. And in this act the same man being regenerate, doth at the same instant both sinne and not sinne. He sinneth onely according vnto the flesh: and in that part, wherein he is renewed, hee doth not sinne, but before and after the fact detesteth his sinne. And as when the spirit preuaileth, the action is not free from all



pollution of the flesh: so when the flesh preuaileth the action is not so corrupt in the regenerate, as it is in those, in whom sinne reigneth. Neuerthelesse I confesse that in euery grieuous fall the flesh doth get the masterie, and that the gift of true faith, after the receit of the wound, lieth flat and in a swoone for a time, but that it is not for all that abolished and quite put out.
               The last degree is perfection, namely 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . when sinne being perfited and ripened by often iteration and custome, groweth as it were vnto a habit. So saith Gregorie: Sin alwaies is finished in a worke by those same 
                  Moral lib. 4 cap. 27. 
                  foure waies. For first the sinne is committed closely after that it is discouered in the sight of men without blushing at the fault: then it is brought into a custome. And at the last either it is nourished with the deceit of vaine hope, or with the obstinacie of wretched despaire. And Isidore: Action bringeth foorth custome, and custome necessitie: And so a man being fettered with these linkes, lieth fast bound as it were with a chaine of vices. This last degree befals not the regenerate, and if it did, saith and the holy spirit



should be shaken out and banished.
               
                  Obiect. II. Adam when he was voide of corruption sell wholly away: therefore much more they, who being borne and regenerated after Adam shall beleeue. Answ. The reason is vnlike: For wee haue 
                  De eor. & grat. c. 11. (saith Augustine) by this grace of God, in the receiuing of that which is good, and in the constant keeping of the same, not onely power to doe that which we will, but also will to doe that which we can, which Adam wanted. For one of these was in him, but the other was not. For to receiue good he wanted not grace, because as yet hee had not lost it. But to continue in it he wanted the helpe of grace, without which he was not able at all to doe it: and he receiued power if he would, but he had not will answerable to his power, for if it had been in him hee should haue perseuered.
               
               
                  Obiect. III. 
                  Propositiō. The member of an harlot cannot be the member of Christ: Assumptiō. But he which beleeueth truly who is actually a member of Christ, may be the member of an harlot: Conclusion. Therefore one that truly beleeues, may come to be no member of Christ. Ans. The member of Christ is diuersly



distinguished: for there is either a true or an apparent member. An apparent member is that, which is not a member according to election, nor in it selfe, but in shew onely, that is, iudged by meanes of outward profession to bee in the visible Church. And it is like a woodden legge fastned to the bodie by art. A true member is either by destination and appointment, or now actually one. Members by appointment are all those who are elected, although they be not as yet regenerated or borne. An actuall member is either one that is liuely, or halfe dead. A liuely member is that, which is according to election, and in very deede ingrafted into Christ, and ruled by his spirit. That is an halfe dead member, which doth indeede belong to Gods election, and is ingrafted into Christ: but yet being hurt by some grieuous fall, hath so much as in it is, lost the grace of the holy spirit. Now I answere to the Proposition. First, a member of Christ in shew may be the m
                     •
                  mber of an harlot, as a woodden foote, which is indeede the member of some image, may be an apparent



member of a mans bodie whereto it is fitted by arte. Secondly, a member of Christ by appointment (in Gods decree) may be the member of an harlot, as Paul 
                  Gal. 1. 15. who was separated from the wombe, was for a time a member of Satan persecuting the Church. Thirdly, he which is a liuely and actiue member of Christ and so continueth, cannot be the member of an harlot: but a member that is crazie and halfe dead may be. For howsoeuer he remaineth in Christ in respect of incorporation and the mysticall vnion, yet hee is out of him as touching the force and efficacie of the spirit, which for a time through his owne default hee doth not perceiue, vntill he doe repent. A leg that 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . is troubled with the pals
                     •
                  e, or receiueth no nourishment, is a true legge, because in respect of vnion it is incorporated into the bodie, howsoeuer it hath almost lost all communion and fellowship with the rest of the members. Neither must this which I say seeme strange, that the member of Christ may in some sort bee the member of an harlot: because the coniunction is not of the same kinde. The



coniunction with Christ is spirituall, but that which is with an harlot is corporall.
               This platforme giueth vnto euery man 
                     
                        •
                     rror 9. a free will flexible and inclinable to both parts by grace, and teacheth that it is in mans will to apply himselfe to grace being giuen, by the help of vniuersall grace, or to reiect the same through the weaknes of corrupt nature. But this is false: for the first vniuersall grace is not effectuall, vnlesse it be confirmed by the second grace following it. As for example: If a man shall receiue power to beleeue if he will, yet he shall neuer actually and indeede beleeue, except there be also giuen the helpe of the other grace, which bringeth the former into act. But this second grace is not giuen to all and euery one. Moreouer, this opiniō is repugnāt to very plain places of Scripture. Iere. 32. 40. I will make an euerlasting couenant with thē, that I will not turne away from thē to do them good, and I will put my feare in their hearts that they shall not depart from me. Againe, 1. Cor. 1. 8. 9. God shall confirme you vnto she end blamelesse: God is faithfull by whous



ye are called vnto the fellowship of his sonne Iesus Christ our Lord. It is also contrarie to Christs speech: Ioh. 6. 45. E
                        •
                     eery man that hath heard and hath learned of the Father commeth vnto me. This grace (saith Augustine) which is secretly infused into 
                  Cant. 1. 3. 
                  mens hearts by Gods liberalitie, is refused of no hard heart. And afterward: If it had 
                  De praed. sanct. cap. 8. 
                  pleased the Father to teach them to come vnto Christ, who accounted the word of the crosse foolishnes, without all doubt, they also would haue come—: why doth he not teach all? If we shall say, because they will not learne, whom he doth not teach: it will be answered vs: and where is that which is said vnto him, Thou O Lord, conuertest and quicknest vs. Againe: The effect of Gods mercie cannot be in mans power so, as that hee should shew 
                  Ad Simplic. lib. 1. q. 2. 
                  mercie to him in vaine if man be vnwilling, because if he would haue mercie on them, he could call them so, as they should be fitted to moue, vnderstand, and follow. And againe: God sheweth mercie to none in vaine, but vnto whom he sheweth mercie, him he calleth so, as hee knoweth to be sitting for him, that hee may not reiect him who calles him. Neither doe I here respect the distinction of sufficient



and effectuall grace: for I acknowledge no grace sufficient for the conuersion of a sinner, which is not effectuall, as I haue alreadie said before: because free will is altogether wanting in spirituall things. We are starke dead in sinnes, and our sufficiencie is whollie from God. Therefore there is in vs beside the want

                     . of originall righteousnesse a three fold impotencie. The first is that, whereby wee are vnable to receiue or desire supernaturall grace offered by God. The second is that, whereby wee are vnable to vse it lawfullie: The third is that, whereby we are vnable to retaine and keepe it. And therefore there are certaine degrees of grace to bee bestowed in the true conuersion of a sinner, in respect of which Augustine makes a fiuefold grace, preuenting, De grat. & lib. arb. c. 17 preparing working, coworking, and the gift of perseuerance. Preuenting grace is that, whereby God inspireth into Praeueniens. the mind of the sinner that is to bee conuerted good thoughts, a good purpose, and a desire of supernaturall grace. The meanes whereby preuenting grace is giuen, is the voyce and preaching of the



Gospell, by the which being heard and thought vpon, the holy Ghost doth shew forth his efficacie and power. For hence it is that the Gospell is called the ministerie of the spirit, 2. Cor. 36. And that, faith is said to be by hearing, Rom. 10. 17. Therefore they, which are out of the Church do want the preuenting grace, vnlesse it bee extraordinarily cōferred, which yet is very seldome done. Preparing grace is that, Praeparans. whereby it is giuen vs to consent vnto God offring grace, or whereby the mind and wil are prepared, that they may yeeld assent and obedience to the holy spirit. For as all supernaturall grace in respect of Gods donation, is altogether from him: euen so wee obtaine our consentment and power to receiue grace conferred no otherwise then by the gift of God. Working grace is that, wherby we are deliuered from the dominion of sinne, and Operans. are renewed in minde, will and affection, hauing receiued power to obey God. Coworking grace is that, whereby God conferreth and perfitteth, the grace of renewing Cooperans. being receiued. And without this grace following, the first is vnprofitable.



For when grace is giuen by God, and receiued of vs by the second grace, wee doe not vse it lawfully, but by this third grace. Augustine saith well: If in so great weakenesse of this life the will 
                  De cor. & grat. cap. 12 
                  renewed should bee so left vnto the regenerat, that they may remaine in Gods helpe if they themselues will, and if God should not make them for to will, among so many and so mighty temptations the will would faint by reason of the weakenesse thereof. Mans weakenesse therefore is relieued, that through the grace of God there should be will inseparably annexed to the power: and therefore the will though it bee but weake, yet should not for all that faint and be ouercome by aduersitie. Againe: Therefore that we may will he worketh without vs: but when we will, and so will, that we

These fiue graces speken of euen now, being taken seuerally and asunder by themselues, are not sufficient vnto saluation (for the preuenting grace is nothing auaileable without the preparing grace, and the working grace without the coworking grace) yet being ioyned together they are sufficient. And hence it plainely appeareth, that there is not any grace truely sufficient vnto the saluation of a sinner that is starke dead in sinnes, the which is not also effectuall. If so much strength we
                     ••
                   giuen to one, that would lift vp a mightie burthen, as were sufficient, that is, so much as did exceede the weight of the thing that is to be lifted vp, out of al doubt motion would follow, it would come vp: so if God doe giue so much grace, as is sufficiēt, that is, as would ouercome the hardnesse of the heart, the corruption thereof could not possibly hinder it from being conuerted. Moreouer, if these fiue graces do concurre in the conuersion of a sinner, the regenerate person shal not haue



free will flexible alike either to good or euill: neither shall it be in our choice to obey or resist the motion of the spirit. Yea from hence it followeth that it multiplieth grace, and that the wil is so effectually ruled by it in those that are truely conuerted, as that they follow faith and godlines with an inflexible and stedfast affection. The spirit promised vs of God doth not enable vs to walke if we will, but makes vs walke indeed.

                  Rom. 11. 4. 
                  haue not bowed the knee vnto Baal: And those which doe truely beleeue, haue receiued of God both power to perseuere in grace, if they will, and also will to doe that which they haue power to doe. So Augustine: There is in vs by this grace of God (which is by Christ) in receiuing of good, and in the constant keeping of the same not



onely power to doe that which we will, but will to do that which we haue power to doe. Therefore those that doe truely beleeue cannot but perseuere.

For hee is said to will to gather all vnto himselfe, because by the preaching of the word hee calleth all in commune vnto saluation, and prefixeth to himselfe this end of preaching, that they should commit themselues to his protection and fidelitie. By this will therefore hee may will to gather the Iewes together, though in the meane time hee doe not helpe them, that they themselues may be able to will. And he doth also iustly complaine of those that will not, because mens impotencie to that which is good, and their bondage vnder sinne, whereby they are made to nill, and vnable to will that which is good, commeth not from the Creator, but from him who of his owne accord fell away from the Creator. Secondly, I say that Christ is heere said to haue willed, not as hee is God effectually mollifying and conuerting the hearts of men, but as he was a minister of



the circumcision, whiles hee sought the Rom. 15. 8, conuersion of the Iewes by preaching. A place altogether like is in Act. 7. 51. where the Iewes are said to haue rushed against or resisted the holy Ghost. But these words are 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . to be vnderstood, not in regard of the inward and effectual operation of the spirit, but in respect of the outward ministery of the Prophets. It pleased Lumbard also to interpret this place: How often would I haue gathered thy children, and thou wouldst 
                  Lib. 1. dist. 16. 
                  not? thus: So many as I haue gathered together, I did it by my effectuall will, thou being vnwilling.
               
                  Obiect. III. Reuel. 3. 20. I stand at the dore and knocke, if any shall open it vnto me I will come in vnto him. Therefore all, at whose dore Christ knocketh, haue sufficient grace whereby they are able to open if they will. Hee is vnwise that knocketh at the dore, if he know assuredly that there is no bodie within that is able to open it. Answere: This place fauoureth not vniuersall grace, for these at whose dore Christ knocketh are chose which beleeue and are conuerted: and hee knocketh at their hearts, partly by his word, partly by



afflictions, that hee might stir vp their languishing faith, and increase and confirme his fellowship with them. You may read the like in Cant. 5. 1. 2. Open vnto me my sister, my loue, my doue?
               Tenthlie, this platforme disagreeth with it selfe. For it saith that God doth Error 10. conferre vnto all men all the helpes of nature and grace, and that he is not wanting to any so, but that he may obtaine saluation. But I say, and that out of this platforme, that God is wanting to some offendors; because he giueth them onlie a power to perseuere in faith if they will: or (if you had rather) a power to will to perseuere; Posse velle perseuerare. and maketh thē not to perseuere actually and indeed. And vnlesse this grace be giuen, it is not possible, that anie should obtaine saluation by perseuering. For it is a most sure rule: A man doth not that good thing, which by grace he is able for to doe, vnlesse God make him to doe it, as he hath made him able to doe it if hee will. Therefore hee, to whom the verie act of perseuerance is not giuen, being smitten with the violence of some grieuous temptation, without delay



will fall away from faith and shall bee damned.
               Lastly, this hypothesis or platforme is Error 11. but the varnishing and fresh trimming ouer of certain opinions, which the Church in former ages did condemne. The Pelagians taught that all men were redeemed Aug. cont. Iul. Pelag. lib. 3. cap. 3. by Christ, but not made free: because god distributed his gifts according to the capablenes of thē which came to receiue them. The same did Faustus the Pelagian also affirme: How hath God (saith he) redeemed 
                  Lib. degrat. & lib. arb. 1 cap. 16. 
                  all the world? doe wee not see men to line still in their sinnes. How shall wee thinke that they are ransomed whom wee doe see still to continue captiues? Let vs gather that which is here mens by vsing a similitude; as for example: If any embassadour or priest purposing to make intercession for a citie taken by warre, shall bestow a very great ransome, and set free from his seruitude who is the chiefe Commander, all the multitude which is in captiuitie, in so much that they are altogether deliuered from all constraint on necessitie of bondage: and then if happily either their vsuall delight, or some soothing slaue, shall so instantly vrge some of the captiues,



as that euery one turning seruant and slaue to his owne will, shall refuse that freely bestowed benefit: shall we
                        •
                      say that the contempt of the vnthankefull captiue hath lessened the estimation of the ransome? or that he which refuseth libertie, doth any way diminish the good will of him that ransometh? surely no. For euen as hee which returneth may bee well accepted with him that doth ransome him, so is hee guiltie of contempt who did not returne. Thus we see that the Pelagians did forge or frame a redemption through Christ, without deliuerance. And what else doe they who publish in their pamphlets, that all and euery one on Gods part are redeemed, but not saued, because they will not beleeue? And now let vs heare the confutation of this opinion. Augustine saith: You say they are redeemed, 
                  Cont. Iul. lib. 3. cap. 3. 
                  but they are not deliuered; they are washed, but they are not clensed—: these bee your monstrous opinions—: these are the paradoxes of the Pelagian heretikes, &c. but I pray thee tell me how can this redemption be vnderstood, if he doe not redeeme from euill, which redeemed Israel from all their sinnes?



for wheresoeuer we make mention of redemption, there also is vnderstood a ransome: and what is that but the precious blood of the imma

                     ulate lambe Christ Iesus? and concerning this ransome, why should we aske any other, wherefore it was giuen? let him that gaue the ransome, let him that paid the price make the answere. This is, saith he, my blood which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes. Proceede, I pray proceede, and as you say in the Sacrament of our Sauiour, men are baptized, but they are not saued: they are redeemed, but they are not deliuered:—so say you also; Christs blood is shed for them for the remission of sinnes, but they are clensed by the remission of no sinne. They are wonderfull, strange, and vntrue things which you affirme.

to that saying of the Prophet: O death, I will be thy death, and thy sting O Hell: we do decree that it ought simply and faithfully to be held and taught, according to the Euangelicall and Apostolicall truth, that we iudge that this ransome was giuen for them, of whom the Lord himselfe saith: Euen as Moses lifted vp the Serpent in the wildernesse: so must the Sonne of man be lifted vp, that euery one which beleeueth in him may not perish, but haue eternall life. So God loued the world that hee gaue his onely begotten sonne, that euery one that beleeued in him might not perish, but haue euerlasting life. And the Apostle saith, Christ was once offered for the taking away of the sinnes of many.
               
               
                  Prosper ascribes this platforme of generall Spist. ad August. grace vnto the Pelagians. This is (saith he) their very opinion and profession: That Adam sinning, euery man sinned, and that no man is saued by his owne workes, but by the grace of God in regeneration. And yet that the reconcilement which is in the sacrament of Christs blood, is without exception offered vnto all men, so that whosoeuer will come vnto faith and baptisme may be saued,



and that God did foreknow before the creation of the world, who should beleeue, or who should remaine in that faith, which must afterward be propped and helped by his grace, and that hee predestinated them vnto his kingdome, who being freely called, he foresaw that they would be worthie of election, and that they would depart out of this life making a good end. And that therefore euery man is prouoked to beleeue and doe good by godly institutions, that no man may despaire of the attainement of eternall life, seeing that there is a reward prepared for a voluntarie deuotion. The difference I confesse consists in this, that the Pelagians doe either wholly ascribe vnto nature the abilitie to do well, or else partly to nature, and partly to grace; but this platforme ascribeth all things wholly vnto grace, which indeede is very right: but whilest they goe about to ordaine vniuersall grace, they doe not free themselues, but are rather more entangled. For most true is that saying of Peter Martyr: Whilest these men make grace so common to all, they turne grace into nature. And I would willingly Io

be certified, whether they who haue receiued this grace, be regenerate or no: if they be regenerate, then all men are regenerate: if they bee not regenerate, then haue all men power to beleeue and to attaine saluation if they will, yea euen whilest they remaine vnregenerate. But this power, if it bee in man before his conuersion, will not differ much from nature. And if so be that grace extend as farre as nature, wee must not pray more for grace than for nature: neither neede wee any more pray for the conuersion of vnbeleeuers, because it is in their owne power, by reason of generall grace, to be conuerted if they will. Prosper also ascribeth this platforme to the Pelagians in these verses: Lib. car. de ingratis.
               
               
                  
                     Thus we determine of that grace that makes
                     Vs Gods owne people, and to him full deere:
                     But yee affirme that no man it forsakes,
                     But that the world from sinne it freeth cleere
                     And passing none, doth proffer meere saluation
                     To all without exception; yet they come
                     Guided by their owne list to this vocation,
                     And motions of the mind, directing some,

               But afterwards he condemneth it in this sort:

                  Faustus the Semipelagian accused the Lib. 1. de lib, arb. cap. 19. Catholiques, in that they said that our



Lord Iesus Christ did not take vpon him mans flesh for all men, nor died generally for all. And on the other side the Catholiques accuse the Pelagians, in that they say that God repelleth none from eternall life, but is willing,

                  indifferently that all men * should be saued and to come vnto the knowledge of the truth. And againe: that they say that our Lord Iesus Christ died for all mankind, and that no man is vtterly exempted from the redemption of his blood, although he leade all this his life estranged from him: because that the sacrament of Gods grace appertaineth vnto all men: whereby many are not therefore regenerated: because they are foreknowne, that they haue not a will to be regenerated; and that therefore on Gods part, eternall life is prepared for all men: but in respect of the freedome of the will, they say that they onely attaine euerlasting life who doe of their owne accord beleeue. And againe they say, that they will not admit of that exposition of that saying, which is alledged out of Augustine: which is, that vnlesse bee will haue all men to be saued. And againe: not onely those which appertaine vnto the number

                  of the faints: but all men altogether, without exception of any.
               
               I wish also that thing were marked: Hilar. epist. ad August. namely that the Catholiques are accused by the Pelagians, that vnder the name of predestination they did establish a certeine fatall necessitie: and that they made a kind of violent preordination. Which accusation hath also been laid against vs. And the like crime sheweth the like cause.
               Lastly, this platforme doth passing wel agree with that doctrine concerning predestination, which is generally maintained in the schooles, and Synagogues of the Papists: yea verily to speake the truth, it seemeth to bee borrowed euen from thence. For if we well consider of the matter, what else hath Pighius taught? What else hath Cartharinus maintained? and else at this day doe the grosse fat Monckes maintaine? who imparke Gods actions in the case of predestination, within these pales. First, say they, God foresaw the natures and sinnes of all men. Then prepared he Christ the redeemer; Afterward,



he willed for the merit of Christ foreseene to bestow sufficient helpes of Grace vpon all men, whereby they might bee saued through Christ: And hee would it euen in this, so much as in him was, that all men might bee saued, his will preceding. Lasily, he did mercifullie predestinate those, whom he did see would end their liues in Gods fauour: and hee did iustly reiect othersome, either for originall or actuall sins, in which he foresaw they would end their liues.

Colos. 1. 26. 27. Which is the mystery hid since the world began and from all ages, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make knowne what is the riches of this glorious mysterie among the Gentiles.

time without Christ, and had no hope, and were Atheists or without God in the world.

                  The most wise Philosophers among the Gentils haue indeed smattered many things of God: but in the meane time what say they of Christ? why should they bee so exceeding silent in this point, if Christ were reuealed vnto all?

Solinus saith, that there is not as yet any of Collectar. 5. cap. 7. the Gentiles found, who hath attained vnto the height of felicitie, and may iustly be accounted happy. Albinus speaketh thus: When such like questions are propounded, why one is iudged thus, and another after another manner, why this man is blinded God giuing him ouer, and another enlightned through Gods assistance, let not vs presume or take vpon vs to iudge of the iudgement of so great a Iudge, but with trembling let vs crie out with the Apostle, O the depth.

                  The foreknowledge of faith in Christ, and of Contempt of the Gospell. priuatiue infidelitie is not the square and rule according to which God hath ordained and disposed his predestination: because there be very manie that neuer so much as heard of Christ; in whom therefore there is neither faith in Christ, nor priuatiue infidelitie, or contempt of the Gospell.
