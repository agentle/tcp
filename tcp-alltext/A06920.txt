For all be it the duty that we

onely gyue vs this grosse, rude and

not only receaue and ioyfully sustē
               tate

wyth moost goodly and godly vertues.
It engraffethe in vs the true

God, the loue of God and of oure

ony manner of good seed, that may

so swete a thynge is it for a man to

            Thus se we how euery nacion is

dyd they instille into the brestes
of theyr yonglynges euen from the

Dulce & decorū estpropatria more. Fight

It is a swete & semely thyng to dye

For no kynd of perel did they refuse

No rytches, no substance, no possessions,
no not theyr owne lyfe dydde

And this maye we se done in y•

slayne in the batayle, came forth in

wyth a iustye and valeaunt

couragiously. But in as much
as it was not only knowē to yt Athenians,
but also to the cōtrary parte
what aūswere was gyuen Codrus
of Apollo, therfore y• enemies gaue
a commaundement that no manne
should hurte the body of kynge Codrus.
Which whan he perceyued, he
conueyed himselfe out of the army,
put of his princelyke armours, clad
hymselfe lyke a cōmon Souldiour,
and returned shortly into the hoost
where both manfully and wyllyngly
he dyed, and by this menes saued

enemies, was it ony other lyke, but
that he should dye, or els slay them?

It is more mery to heare that he is
dead, as it was worthy hym, and y•
citie and his progenitours, than to
lyue all his lyfe lyke a dastarde, and
shew no poynte of valeaūce. O hart
more courageous, thā the feminine

wonte for the mooste parte to loue

more tēderly than y• very mothers.

what should be the ende of the battell.
In the meane season came a certen
man and shewed her that all her
sonnes were slayne. To whome she
sayd, I dyd not demaūd this of the,

O thou sluggysh slaue, but in what
case the contrey stondeth. Whan he
had aūswered, that the contrey had
gotten the victory, she sayde, oh thā
very well, I am glad that my sōnes
are thus dead. This noble woman
dyd set more by the safegarde of her
contrey, than by her priuate affecte
toward her chyldren.
            DamatriaDamatria. also an womā of that
nacion, slewe her owne sonne at his
returne from the battell, because he
behaued hymselfe lyke a coward in
the warres, and dyd not fyght manfully
for the wealthe of his coūtrey.
This semeth to smell barbaryke immanite,
and to be to moche cruell,
notwithstandyng it is a goodly example
to shewe yt all mothers should
desyre nothynge so muche in theyr
chyldren as to haue them euermore
bent to serue the publique affayres
of theyr contre, euē to y• very deth.
            
               The Emperour Otho SyluiusOtho Syluius.
was determined at a certē tyme, I
knowe not for what cause, to gyue
ouer the regimente of his Empyre.
Many came vnto hym, and desyred
hym very instantly, that he woulde
not leaue of his imperial dignite, &
so forsake the commō weale, and the
valeaunt company of noble warryours
y• he had besides other. Among
all one beynge but a Souldiour taken
at aduenture, perceauyng that
the Emperour persisted in his determinaciō,
toke out his swerd & sayd,
O Emperour knowe thou, that we
all are franckely encouraged thus
to do for the. And streyghte wayes
he kylled hymselfe. O lusty harte, &
frāke couragious stomacke. Whom
woulde it not animate to gyue hys
lyfe for the health of his contrey, seyng
so many goodly examples viuely
described and lyuishly set forth in

histories before his face? To moche
brutall is he, that is not moued wt 
these moost memorable antique monumentes.
            But yf I shoulde go forthe to rehearse
all the Histories, whiche declare
how greatly the feruent petie,
the godly affeccion, & the reuerende
loue toward the countrey hath ben
euer estemed in times past of all gē
               tle
and naturall hartes, I should cō
pyle a worke moche longer than the
Iliades of the Greke Poet Homere,
yea I shoulde not only farre excede
y• limites of an epistle, but also onerate
and ouercharge the reader.
            But to make few wordes,we ar no les boūde to our coūtrey now than our aū
                  cetours were ī times past. euen the
very same godly affecciō owe we at
this daye to this our natiue countrey
Englond, that mē of olde time
haue shewed vnto theyr countrey,
except we be estraūged from all naturall
humanite. And what soeuer

oure Auncetours haue done in tymespast,
vnto the very same are we
boūd nowe lykewyse. So that who
so euer detrecteth & refusethe to do
for his countrey, what so euer lieth
in his power, is an vnnatural braū
che, and a corrupte seed, vnworthy
to enioye ony fruyte or commodite
therof, as I may adde nothing here
vnto.
            But all men haue not all gyftes,
neyther can euery man profitte his
countrey alyke. Yet oughte the studious
endeuours and diligent employmentes
of all men, tende vnto
this, that the cōmodite of the publique
weale and the helth of the coū
               tre
should be sought aboue al thynges.
The rytche man with his rytches,
the stronge mā wt his strēgth,
the wyse with his wisdome, the poletike
with his pollecy, the eloquēt
with his eloquēce, the learned with

his learnynge, the artificer wythe
hys science, the plough mā wt his tillyng,
and so euery man in his degre
accordyng to his knowledge ought
to serue his coūtrey. For vnto this
doth the lawe both of God & nature
bynde vs, the whiche to resist is extreme
impiete & playne wickednes.
            But if ony nacion be estraunged
from y• vnnatural affecciō towarde
theyr coūtrey,The hartye affeccion of English mē toward ther countrey. certes I thinke Englonde,
I meane the Inhabitauntes
therof, maye iustly contende wythe
ony cōtrey for the alienaciō of this
vice. It doth me good yea it maketh
me seriously to reioyce euen at y• very
harte, to se how glad my countre
mē are to serue the commodities of
this our countrey Englond. What
so euer our moost excellent Prince,
or ony in his name commaundeth,
it is with all reuerent feare and louyng
expedicion accomplyshed. No

man grutcheth, no man muttereth
no man thyncketh the precepte vnrighteous,
nor the burden heuy, so
feruente a loue do they beare vnto
theyr countrey. All with one cōsent
employe theyr endeuours to satisfy
euen vnto the vttermoste of theyr
power the imperiall precepte of the
kynges moost royall maieste. This
hath Gods word wrought in them,

of the spirite.Ephe. vi. Thanckes be to God
for it. The Lorde of heauen myghte

            Agen the men,The 
                     〈◊〉
                   of Kent. which were prest
to go vnto the warres, it is almoste
incredible to se & perceaue what alacrite
& quickenesse of spirite was in
them. They semed to be so desyrous
to defend theyr countrey, that they
in a manner neglected theyr domesticall
trauayles, theyr priuate businesses,
not moch estemed ther dere
wyues and swete chyldren, no nor

yet theyr owne lyues, so that they
myght in ony poynt do good to the
publique weale of Englond. Whan
I sawe this valeaūt courage in thē,
and perceaued theyr vnfayned affeccion
& loue toward theyr countrey,
Lorde God, wyth how great admiracion
and stupore was I affected
& striken? My ioye was surely greater
thā I cā here expresse, to se this
faythfull obedience in them toward
the Kynges graces maieste, this feruent
loue toward theyr countrey,
this harty affecte toward the cōmō
weale of Englonde. And I doubte
not, but that lyke obeysaunce and
prōptitude was also found in other
places of this Realme.
            These thynges thus done,The good mynd & feruent affecciō of y• Author towarde his countrey. I began
to thynke with my selfe on this
manner, Lord God, vnder howe vnfortunate
starre was I borne, that
am endewed neither with wyt, pollecy,

valeaunce, strength, wysdome,
rytches, or ony other thynge, wherwythe
I maye do good to my countrey,
as other men do. The vayne of
my wytte is barren, my pollecye is
grosse, my valeaunce is nothynge,
my strength is lytle, my wisdom is
base, my riches are not worth a Gally
halfe peny besydes a few bokes &
a lytle slender apparell. Alas what
shall I do? Shall I shewe my selfe
in no poynt thanckefull to my coū
               trey?
Shal other men ieopard both
theyr lyues and goodes for the safegarde
of the publique weale, and I
in the meane season do nothynge?
Shall I be founde an vnnaturall
braūche and a corrupte seed: It shameth
me to lyue, and I maye ryght
well recount my selfe moost miserable
seynge I am coniecte into suche
vnfortunate state, that I am able
by no meanes to do that for my coū
               trey

in acte, whiche my mynde coueteth
in wyll.
            At the last I remembred ye poore
wydowe of ye Gospel,Luke. xxi. which althogh
she were not able to cast into y• treasury
so moche as the rytche mē dyd,
yet offered two minutes & ware accepted
for her good wyll. I called also
vnto remembraunce, howe gentylly
king Artozerzes,Kyng Artozerzes. with diuers
other were wont to receaue base, sī
               ple,
homely & cōmon gyftes of theyr
subiectes, & to geue them rewardes
worthy a Prīce for theyr good wyl.
Whan I perpēded these thynges wt
my self it encouraged me to do some
what (althoughe ye somewhat maye
ryghte well be recounted some lytle
nothyng) that I may shew my selfe
not altogither vnworthy the beneficence
of my countrey. And for as
muche as I haue bene trayned vp
from my cradles in the court of Lady

Mnemosyne & her doughters, &
exercised in the wrastlynge place of
Apollo (althogh I maye iustly seme
to haue bene there but a vayne gazer
and ydle spectatour) I thought
it not vndecente accordynge to my
profession of letters to bryng for the
some litteral lucubraciō which beīg
diligentely red and followed of my
coūtremē, shoulde not be altogither
vnfruytfull to our cōmon coūtrey.
I haue therefore in thys tumulte &
noyse of warres compyled a certen
lytle Treatyse, entitled, The pollecy
of warre,The cont
                     ••
                  tes of thys boke. not vnworthy the readynge
chefely at this tyme. In it I
haue declared in howe pitefull case
y• christen publique weale consisteth
almoost vniuersally. I haue shewed
also what is the cause of these cruell
warres, that reygne n
                     •
                  we almoost
thorowe out the whole worlde, & by
what meanes they maye be ceased.

I haue furthermore openned after
what manner we maye get the victory
of our enemies. Agayne I haue
shewed howe y• Souldiours ought
to behaue them selues bothe whan
they go to ye warres, and whā they
are in them, that God maye be on
theyr syde. Moreouer I haue declared,
howe they that tarye at home,
oughte also to behaue them selues,
vnlesse that for theyr iniquite & vnryghteous
behauoure God forsake
our army. Finally I haue here opē
                  ned
how christen men shall returne
frō the warres after they haue gotten
the victory, and on what manner
they shall behaue them selues, y•
theyr countrey may enioye peace &
tranquilite euer after.
            
            All theyse thynges haue I done
in this lytle treatyse followyng,Si quis loquitur ut sermones Deiloquatur. accordyng
as I trust, to the vayne of
the holy scripture And as gladly as

I haue compiled this shorte worke,
so gladly would I haue done ony other
thynge for the incolumite and
safegarde of my countrey, yf it had
lyghen in my power. Uerely let all
men beleue me, if my rytches & wisdome
had bene equall withe Salomons,
if my pollecy & strengthe had
bene lyke with Sāpsons, I would
no lesse hartelye haue employed thē
all for the wealthe of my countrey,
than I haue bestowed my labour in
settynge for the this lytle treatyse.
But whan I maye not do y• one, let
it suffice that I do the other. The
Poet sayth, In magnis uoluisse satest. Nether
is he altogyther ingrate & vnkynd,
which for his puissaūce maynly
cōtēdeth to shewe hymselfe thākefull
and kynd agayne, although his
acte at all tymes dothe not greatly
aunswere his good wyll. Notwythstandyng
I trust, yf this my worke

be diligently read, marked and followed,
it shall not onlye declare my
honest and naturall harte towarde
my countrey, but also teache men a
more godly fashō in the warres, thā
hathe bene hytherto vsed of many.
I praye God, it maye brynge forthe
no lesse frute, than I haue entēded.
But this my labour what so euer it
be I offer to your ryght worshypful
mastershyp, both because ye are one

               I Thynke ther is no
man, that hath ye Christen
fayth dwellyng in
his harte, and looke the
for another worlde after
this lyfe muche more blissed, wel
thy & quiet thā this is, but that beleueth
assuredly that thende of this
moost miserable & wretched worlde

with all the vayne pompe and pompous
vanite therof is at hande, at
the leest not farre of, as ye holy scriptures
testify in many places. For yf
we searche the diuine volumes diligently,
& ponder what tokens shall
immediately go before the daye of
iudgement, we shall haue a iust occasiō
to thinke & vndoubtedly to be
perswaded, that the vayne glory of
this synfull world, yea the world it
self is at y• latter age, & redy as they
saye to be buried & wrapped vp in y•
floud of Lethe. Among all the other
tokens & signes of the day of iudgement,
which are to many for to rehearse
at this present, doth not our
moste merciful sauiour Iesus christ
in the Gospell of Mathewe declare,Mat. xxiiii.
that we shall heare of wōderful battels,
& that naciō shall ryse agaynst
nacion, & kyngdome agaynst kyngedome,
and that there shall be pestilē
               ces,

honger and earthquakes in all
places, agen that the faythfull preachers
of Gods word, & the true christen
men shall be greuously afflicted
ponyshed, troubled, hated of all nacions,
yea and cruelly slayne for his
names sake?The niserable state of this worlde. As I maye leaue of to
speake of the extreme pestilences, of
the feruent honger, & terrible earth
quakes, wherwythe diuers londes
now of late haue bengreuously troubled,
& yet are not fre from them, as
I maye also speake nothyng of ye tyranicall
persecucion, the vngentle
handlyng, the cruell empresonment
the bocherlyke slayeng both by fyre
sweard, water, hempe, famin, secret
murther▪ &c. of the true prechers of
Gods worde & of the other faythful
Christians, whiche haue boldly and
gladly offered them selues vnto the
very death for the glory of God and
the name of his sonne Iesus Christ

for a wytnes agenst the popysh kingdome
& all theyr wycked doctrine.
What fears & cruell warres reygne
now almoost in euery place thorowout
the worlde? Howe many forren
Princes do inuade now a dayes one
anothers Realme? What ambicion
occupyeth the hartes of temporall
rulers, which moueth them both wt 
swerde and fyre vnmercifully to destroye
the iust & ryght possessions of
other, that they alone as Gods may
reygne in this worlde? Doth not y•
Prince recount himselfe moost happy,
whiche wyth all kynd of violēce
agaynst all equite and iustice canne
moost dilate & enlarge hys Empyre
& dominiō? Thus is the christē publique
weale rēt & torne, & miserably
defloured. Thus is all good order
chased awaye out of the boundes of
Christendom. Thus is ye study both
of diuine & humayne letters vtterly

neglected & set nought by. Thus
is iustice and all kynd of humanite
exiled, & in theyr stede is entred vnpunyshed
robbery, cruell thefte. Insatiable
spoylynge of other mennes
goodes, & an whole see of barbarous
& beastlyke manners. To conclude,
thus is it come to passe, y• we haue
scasely so muche as a steppe of true
godlynes lefte among vs, into such
miserable case are we fallen in these
perillous & latter dayes, accordyng
to the prophecy of Christ. Who lame
tethe not to heare theyse thynges?
Whose harte dothe not tremble and
shake euen as the quakynge flames
of Aetna, to remēber this great calamite
& greuous misery of y• Christen
publique weale? What man is
so farre estraūged from all naturall
humanite & tender compassion, that
wisheth not rather to be out of this
wretched worlde, than to beholde so

dolorous syghtes & pitiefull spectacles?
O the vnspeakable wretchednes
of this world. O the infinite cares
& innumerable troubles of this
poore lyfe. O the madnes of mortal
men, which consyder not these thinges,
but lyke brute beastes go forth
to followe theyr sensuall appetites &
beast like pleasures.Mark well. Certes the state
of this worlde requireth not delicicious
fare, but continuall fastynge,
not gorgious apparell, but weryng
of sackeclothe, not annoyntynge wt 
swete bawmes, but sprynkelyng wt 
asshes, not resting in soft fether beddes,
but lieng vpon the hard groūd,
not laughyng, but mournyng, not
iestyng but lamentyng, not scoffing
but waylyng, not wanton wordes,
but feruente prayers, not playenge
at the dyse & cardes, but continuall
meditacion in the lawe of our Lord
God, not heapynge vp togyther of

worldly possessions, but the glad distribucion
of them to the poore mē
               bers
of Christ, that we may be rytch
in the lyuyng God, and haue all our
trust & confidence in hym. Wo be to
them that laugh at theise thynges.
Wo be to them that seke not vnto y•
vttermost of theyr power to redresse
these piteful enormities of the christen

that saye, peace, peace, all is well, all
is well, and consyder not that a finall

to deface the honour of our Lord y•

Hath not his fearce and furious

there both destroyed theyr chyrches
and shewed suche crudelite amonge
thē as was neuer heard? What shal
I speake of Hungarye, sometyme a
floryshynge and noble Realme, but
now moste miserably assayled, inuaded,
yea and in many places therof
piteously oppressed both by swearde
and fyre of this moost cruell enemy
of Christes religiō? I passe ouer many
other Empyres and kyngdoms,
whiche also haue tasted of hys furious

tyranny and lyonlyke crudelite
And who is able to expresse ether by
tonge or penne how miserable a lyfe
the Christians lyue vnder the dominion
of this Turkysshe Tyraunte?
Alas is it possible, that he should be
a frende & mercyfull rulare to men
of the christen religion, seynge that
he is an enemy to vs both in name,
dede, lawe, professiō, kynd of religiō,
maners, ordināces. &c. Surely surely
Christen men wt hym are in worse
case, thā brute beastes are with vs.
Doth not he wrytyng to the kynge

If he handleth them on thys wyse,
whom we haue in so hygh estimaciō
for the ministryng of the holy misteries,
what is than to be thought of
the baser sorte of the Christians. O
Lorde be mercifull to vs, I am sure

he wyll scasely thynke them worthy
to take the breathe of the ayer.
            Who seethe not nowe, howe miserable
the state of the Christiannes is
vnder this moost cruell Tyraunte,
whiche notwithstandynge hath exalted
& encreased his myghte aboue
all Christen Monarchies or Empyres▪
And it is to be feared, seynge he
hath such prosperous successe & tryumphant
victories agenst the Christians,
that no naciō shall be able to
resist and wythstonde his tyranny,
excepte there be some godly remedy
found shortely. For al thynges prosper
so well wyth hym, that no man
nedeth to doubte, but that he is the
scourge of God to ponish vs for our
wycked and abhominable lyuynge,
whiche without all shame is at this
daye vsed amonge vs.
            Thus se we in what state y• christen
publique weale stondeth, yea rather

lyeth, & is troden vnder foote:
Let vs nowe behold, what the occasion
of it is, and by what meanes it
may be repayred & brought agayne

that we hauing the victory of al
our enemies maye with one accorde
synge perpetuall prayses to ye name
of our Lorde God. Amen.
            What the occasiō of all these cruel
warres is, wherwith we are so miserably
oppressed, it may easly be ꝑceaued
by Histories of the holy scriptures.The cause of warres.
For verely so ofte as I pōder
this matter wt my selfe, me thyncke
I se more clerely than the Sonne, y•
as the only occasion of Goddes blissyng

lykewyse the alone occasion of hys
cursynge, that is to saye, of his plages,

straung worshyppyng of God, despisynge
of hys worde▪ kyllynge of the
true preachers, & wycked lyuynge.
Do not the diuine Histories shewe
euidētly, that so longe as the people
of Israel obeyed God, serued him accordynge
to his worde, hathened to
hys preachers, walked in his wayes
led a pure and innocēt lyfe, they enioyed
all kynd of felicite & pleasure,
and euer gat the oue
                  •
               hand of theyr
enemies? Howe dydde the publique

moost noble Captayne & victorious
Prynce Iosue? What kyngdom did
they inuade and not subdue? What
dyd they take in hande, & broughte
not vnto fortunate successe & prosperous
ende? Howe came thys to
passe, by theyr owne pollecye, wytte
and strength? Na verely. For they

dispayred of theyr owne strengthes
and sayde, we are not able to go vp
agaynst the people, for they are strō
               ger
than we They are mē of a great
stature, yea we are like greshoppers
in cōparison of them? It was God
that dyd fyght for them.Num. xiii. xiiii. God slewe
theyr enemies. God gaue them the
victory, and brought them into the
possession of that londe. Feare not y•
people of that londe, sayd Iosue, for
they are but breade for vs. Theyr
shylde is departed from them, & the
Lorde is wythe vs, feare them not
therfore. The Lorde youre God,Iosue. xxiii. he
shall expell and cast them out before

as the Lorde youre God hathe
sayde to you. One of you shall chase
a thousand, for the Lord your God
he fyghteth for you.
            But howe came it to passe, that
they prospered on thys wyse, & had

God so on theyr syde, that nothyng
was able to preuayle agaynste thē?
Uerely because they dyd abyde stedfast
in the lawe of the Lorde. They
ranne not an whorehuntyng after
straunge Goddes. They dyd stycke
fast vnto y• Lorde theyr God. They
harkened to his faythfull prechers.
They worshipped & serued him not
after theyr owne fāsy, but accordīg
to the prescripte of his holy worde.
They sought hys glory in all thynges,
and wrought accordyng to hys
holy wyll. So came it to passe, that
they were made blyssed & fortunate
of God.
            Agayne in the boke of Iudges &
of Kynges, do we not se in thē that
so long as the Israelites walked accordyng
to Gods worde, they prosperred
and floryshed aboue all nacions,
and whan they fell vnto Idolatry
& wycked lyuynge, that god stored

vp some Tyrāt, which oppressed

that all thynges wente thus to hauock
wtout mercy? Forsorth ye scripture
sayth, theyr kynge Sedechias
fyrst of all dyd ye, which displeased y•
Lord. He hūbled not himselfe before
Ieremias ye Prophet at the mouth
of the Lord, but was styffe necked &
hard harted to turne vnto y• Lorde
God of Israel. All ye rulers also of
ye prestes wyth the people trespassed
apace after all abhominacions of ye
Hethen, & polluted the house of the
Lorde, which he had halowed in Ierusalē.
And the Lorde God of theyr
fathers sent to them by his messangers,
sendyng them betymes, for he
had compassiō on his people and on
his dwellyng place. But they mocked
the messangers of God and despised
theyr wordes, and misused his
Prophetes, vntyll the wrath of the

Lorde so arose agaynste hys people,
that it was past remedy.
            Here se we agayne that the occasiō
of this miserable captiuite, whiche
y• Iewes sustayned, was bicause
they receaued not the Prophettes,
harkenned not to Gods worde, but
folowed theyr owne sātasies, wroughte
that whiche was good in theyr
owne syghte, and lyued after theyr
owne sēsuall & beastlyke appetites.
            What shall I speake of the finall
destrucciou of the Iewes at Hierusalē
after Christes ascension? What
was ye cause of that theyr greuous
misery and vnoutspeakable calamite?
Was it not because they crucitied
the sonne of god, despysed his doctrine,
slewe his Apostles, walked after
theyr owne tradicions, followed
theyr olde wycked forfathers, lyued
all in pleasure, regardyng nothyng

Was not theyr disobedience
to Gods word cause therof, & theyr

thorowe oute all the histories bothe

Yea the Lorde hymselfe sayde: Bycause

as theyr fathers taught thē: Therfore
thus sayth the Lord of hoostes
the God of Israel: Beholde I wyll
fede this people wythe wormeode, &
gyue them gall to dryncke. I wyll
scatter them also among the Hethē,
whome neyther they nor theyr fathers
haue knowē. And I wyl send
a sweard among them to persecute
them, & neuer leaue vntyll I bryng

them to nought.Iere. xxvi. Itē, yf ye wyll not

styl sendyng: If ye wyll not followe
them, I saye, than wyll I do vnto
this house, as I dyd vnto Sylo, &
wyll make this cytie to be abhorred
of al the people of the earth.

For euen as it was in the tyme of ye

They mayntayned the wicked tradicions
of theyr forefathers, euen so

            O Englond,Of Englōd Englond myn owne

to the Lorde our God, & am
redy at euery hour wyllyngly to sustayne

Would God, would God thou wast

thou dyddest not aduse y• moost precious

endewed from aboue before al other

done the by restorynge vnto the the

the so noble and vertuous a Prince
to mayntayne y• same.Exod. xvi. Would God
thou wast not lyke to the olde disobediēt
& murmuring Iewes, which
had pleasure rather to be in Egypt
wyth the grecy flesh pottes, than in
the seruyse of God wyth the celestiall
meate Māna. Would God thou
myghtest not iustly be resembled to
Lothes wyfe,Gene xix. whiche after she was
delyuered from the fylthy Sodomites,
had a delyght to looke backe agen
vnto them. Would God ye name
of the moost highest were not dishonoured
by thy shamefull and abhominable
othes, whiche thou dayely
vsest. Wolde God thou wast not disobedient,
but faythfull & true in all
poyntes to thy superiours. Would
God thou wast not polluted wythe
fornicacion, adultry, whoredome, in

cest, and all other vnclēnes. Would
God thou wast not an vniust taker
awaye of other mēs goodes. Would
God thou dyddest not thyrste after
the sheddynge of innocent bloude.
            Would God, thou wast not redy to
beare false witnes agenst thy neighbours.
Would God thy men of law
were not eaters of gyftes, & oppressours
of the poore people for lucres
sake. Would God thy pastours and
spiritual sheppardes were not so giuen
to pleasure, ambicion, pryde, couetousnes,
delicate fare, gorgious

mynde to fede Christes flocke wt the

they were not callers backe & vtter
despisers of ye same,Math. xxiii neither entryng
into the kyngdome of heauen themselues,
nor yet sufferyng other that
would to enter. To be shorte, would
God thou wast not a manifest trāsgressour̄
               
and opē offendour of gods

be fre from the vengeaunce and plages
of God, ye are lyke to faull vpon

and amend thy synnefull lyuynge.
O Englōnd,God calleth Englōd vnto repentāce diuers wayes. Englond, God calleth
the vnto repentaūce diuers wayes,
as by his worde, by the preachynge
of the same, by sendyng the suche a
vertuous, mercyful, fatherlyke and
puyssaunt a Prynce, by endewyng

If thou regardest not this goodnes
of God, surely Englonde great
wyll be thy dānacion, greuous wyl
be thy plages, intollerable wyll be
thy ponyshmentes, to moche lamen
table wyll be thy finall destruccion.
O Englond with wepyng teares I
saye vnto the,Luke. xix, as Christ sayde vnto
Hierusalem: If thou dyddest know
euē at this thy tyme, those thynges

whiche belong vnto thy peace, surely
thou wouldest be more diligēt to
looke after them. For easyer & more
tollerable shall it be for Sodome &
Gomorre, for Tyrus & Sydon at y•
daye of iudgement than for the, excepte
thou repentest and embracest
with metyng armes, as they saye, y•
goodnes and great mercy of GOD
which is nowe proferred the.
            Of these thynges aforsayde is it
euident that thoccasion of all these
cruell warres & other plages, wherwith
we are so miserably oppressed,
is the despisyng of Gods word, and
the wicked and dissolute manner of
lyuynge that is vsed amonge them

Neuer was there Prynce, yt

might lawfully at ony time be ascribed
vnto ony temporall rulare, certes
to our moste victorious Prynce
it is moost of all due & conuenient.
For he is a very ryght & true father
to this our countrey of Englonde,
as his moste godly actes and vertuous
enterprises do manifestly shew
euery day more and more. We read

that Augustus the Emperour,Augustus Caesar. whē
he had both garnyshed very pleasātly
and fortressed very strongely the
Citie of Rome, so y• so moche as laye

Gedeon bryngeth only with hym a

and yet of these God commaunded
hym to put awaye all excepte thre
hōdred. His wordes were, these: The
people that are wyth the, are to many
for me to gyue the Madianites
into theyr handes, lest Israel make
theyr boast vnto my dishonour, and
saye, our owne hand hath saued vs.
And whan there were of Gedeons

there abode wt hym only ten thousande,
God sayde once agayne vnto
hym, the people are yet to many.
            
               The conclusion was, that all went
theyr waye besydes thre hondred, &
by them only thorowe his myghty
power dyd God gyue the Madianites

them that were slayne of the Madi

The Lord is ye defender of my lyfe,

Whā the wycked came vnto me for
to eate my flesh, they that wrought
me ony wo, and were myn enemies,
stōbled & fell, so that now although
an hoost of men were layd agaynste
me, yet shall not my hart be afrayd.
And though there rose vp warre agaynst
me, yet wyll I put my trust
in hym, God hymselfe also sayth by
the Psalmographe,Psal. xC. for asmoche as
he hath trusted in me, I wyl deliuer

he hath knowen my name. He cryed

I wyll replenyshe hym withe longe
lyfe, and at the last I wyll shew him

my sauyng health.
            All the scriptures heretofore rehearsed
declare euidently that God
alone is the myghtye helper, & that
he only it is, whiche gyueth the victory
of theyr enemies to his people,
that is, to so many as beleue & trust
in hym, and that withoute hym all
hymayne industry, labour wyt, conueyaunce,
pollecy. &c. are of none effecte,
yea rather hurteth than profytteth,
hyndereth then furdereth,
destroyeth than sauethe. Blyssed is

and what so euer they shal take

God casteth vpon vs, whyther they
be battell, honger, pestilence or ony
other, chaunse vnto vs for our synfull
& abhominable lyuyng, wher wt 
God is so greatly prouoked vnto anger:
Agayne, that he wyll not cease
thus to plage vs, if he loueth vs, vntyl
we earnestly repent & studiously
amende our lyfe. If he seeth, yt none
amendment wyll followe his correccion,
yet wyll he go forth styll to ponyshe
vs, and neuer cease vntyll he
hath rooted vs & our memory oute
of the earth, because his holy name

may be no more blasphemed among
the Hethen thorow our wyckednes
and abhominacion. Your misdedes
sayth Esay,Esaye. lix. haue seperated you frō
your God, & your synnes haue hyddē
his face from you, that he should
not heare you.The Prophet describeth the mā
                  ner of this worlde. For your handes are
defyled wyth bloud▪ & your fyngers
with vnrighteousnes. Your lyppes
speake leasynges, & your tonge setteth
out wickednes. No man regardeth
ryghteousnes, no man iudgeth
truely Euery man hopeth in vayne

are the dedes of wickednes, and

the worke of robhery is in theyr hā
               des.
Theyr feete runne vnto euell,
& they make haste to shed innocent
bloude. Theyr councels are wycked
councelles, harme & destruccion are
in theyr wayes, but ye way of peace
they know not. &c And a lytle after,
our offenses are many before the, O
Lord, & our synnes testify agaynst
vs, yea we must nedes confesse that
we offende, and knowledge that we
do amysse, namely transgresse & dissemble
agaynst the Lorde, and faull
awaye from our God, vsyng presūptuous
& traytorous imaginacions,
& castyng false matters in our hartes.
For equite is gone asyde, and
ryghteousnes stondethe a farre of.
Trueth is fallen downe in y• strete,
& that thyng that is playne & open,
maye not be shewed. Yea truethe is
layde in presonne, & he that refraynethe
hym selfe from euell, must be

spoyled. When the Lorde sawe this,
it displeased hym sore, y• there was
no where ony equite. He saw also, y•
there was no man, whiche had pitie
therof, or was greued at it. And he
helde hym vp by hys owne power, &
cleued to his owne ryghteousnes.

the wynd of the Lorde hath moued.
            Hytherto haue I rehearsed the
wordes of the Prophet Esay, wherof

we learne, that our wickednes is
y• cause of Gods wrathe toward vs,
notwythstandyng if we cease from
our īiquite, God wyl surely fauour
vs, turne awaye his wrathefull displeasure,
pardonne our synfull iniquite,
forgyue our wycked lyuyng,
wype awaye our vnclennes, and be
our myghty shelde & defender agēst
all our enemies,Esaye. 
                     •
                  . as he sayth in another
place, youre handes are full of
bloud. Notwythstondyng wash you
make ye clene, put awaye your euell
thoughtes out of my syght, cease to
do euell, learne to do well, seke iudge
mēt, helpe ye poore oppressed, delyuer
y• fatherles, defend ye wydow & come
on your waye, & reproue me, saythe
the Lord. If your synnes be as red
as scarlet, yet shall they be made as
whyght as snowe. And if they were
like purple, yet shal they be like white
wolle. Yea yf ye wyll be contēted

and heare me, ye shall eate the good
fruytes of the earth. If ye wyll not
but prouoke me vnto wrath, ye shall
be deuoured with ye swerde, for thus
hath the Lorde promysed wyth hys
owne mouth, It is commonly sayd,Iere. iii.
sayth God by ye Prophet Hieremy,
if a man putteth awaye his wyfe, &
she goeth from hym, and marryethe
another husbonde, shall he resorte
ony more vnto her? Is not that woman
than defyled & vncleane? But
as for the thou hast played the harlot
 wt many louers, yet turne agen
to me, sayth the Lorde, & I wyll receaue
the. Thou stynckynge Israel
turne agayne, sayth the Lorde, and
I wyll not turne away my face frō
you, for I am mercifull, saythe the
Lorde, and I wyll not be angry for
euermore.
            Thus se we y• though God dothe
plage vs for oure wyckednes, yet if

we repent & amende our synfull lyuynge,
he wyll haue mercy vpō vs,
& turne awaye his anger from vs.
For the Lordes hande is not so shortened,Esaye. 
                     •
                  ix.
that it can not healpe, nether
is his eare so stopped, that it maye
not heare. To obtayne therfore his
fauour, that he maye fyght for vs,
& get vs the victory ouer our aduersaries,
the only & moost nexte waye
is to redresse our noughty māners,
to walke in the pathwayes of his holy
commaundementes & to do that,
which he wylleth vs to do. So may
we be sure thorowe his diuine valeaunce
to subdue all our enemies, as
he hymselfe testifieth, sayeng:Leu
                     •
                  ti. xxvi. If ye
walke in my commaundementes, &
& kepe my preceptes, ye shall pursue
your enemies, and they shall fall before
you. Fyue of you shall chase an
hondred straungers, and an hōdred
of you shall put to flyght ten thousande.

But if ye wyll not heare m
                  •
               ,
but despyse all my commaundementes,
I wyll set my face agenste you,
& ye shall fall before your enemies, &
ye shalbe subdued to them that hate
you, yea ye shall flye, whan no man
pursueth after you. For if we enter
battell with our aduersaries, & yet
be polluted wyth synne, surely God
wyll nether fyght for vs, nor yet wt 
vs. God is not the captayne of wicked
& noughty people. He fightethe
not for them yt embrace īiquite, but
for suche as seake after true godlynes,
pure innocēcy, & loue to walke
in his moost holy commaundementes.
To suche as are transgressours
of his holy word, & yet dare presume
to enter battell, & to looke for helpe
at his hād, he sayth, se y• ye go not vp
& that ye fyght not,Nume. xiiii. Deut. i. for I am not amōg
you, vnlesse ye be plaged before
your enemies. If such fyght, it shall

chaunse vnto them, as it dyd vnto y•
Israelites, which whā they had greuously
offēded God & disobeyed him
would contrary to the commaundement
of God take vpon thē to fight
agenst the Amnorites, but for theyr
disobediēce, notwithstonding theyr
myghty valeaunce & polletyke wisdome
in martial affaires, they were
chased awaye, kutte, hewed, & greuously
slayne. So shal it chaunse to
the wycked and vngodly.
            Iosue hadde a manifest promyse
made to hym of God, that he should
sudue the cananites, & enioye theyr

                  •
               nde peasably, & that therfore he neded
not to feare for to fyght agenst
them,Iosue. vii. yet notwythstondyng loste he
at one tyme the felde, & his mē were
slayne & put to flyghte for the synne
of one man, whiche contrary to the
commaundement of God had takē
of the excōmunicate thynges. For

the offens of hym alone could not y•
chyldrē of Israel stond before theyr
enemies, for asmoche as God was
not wyth them.Nota. If the synne of one
man deserued so great vengeaunce
that for his offence only many were
slayne & put to flyght, what shal we
than saye vnto that army, which is
replete wyth all kynde of synne, as
whoredome, fornicacion, adultrye,
thefte, tyranny, shedyng of innocēt
bloud, sweryng, glotony, dronckenshyp.
&c. How is it possible for them
to prosper? How can God be among
them to fyght for thē & to gyue thē
the victory?A good lessō
                If we wyll subdue our
enemies, we muste seake all means
possible to haue God on oure syde.
We maye not only prouide, that we
scoore of the rust of our harnes that
it be clene, but that we also put out
of our brestes the rusty & fylthy synnes,
that haue cankred oure soules

so long, & so become pure and clene.
For what is the cause that our battels
do but lytyll prosper many tymes,
but onlye that we be synfull, &
God is angry wyth vs? Could that
Nerolyke tyraunt the great Turke
haue subdued so moche of Christendome,☜
if we had lyued accordynge to
our profession? Na verely, our synnes
haue gotten him so many victories.
Our wyckednes hath made vs
captyue & thraull to his tyrannye.
Let vs looke what synne reygneth
amonge vs, & let vs vtterly wype y•
out, so shall we prosper agaynst the
violence of our enemies.
            It was not wythoute a cause, y•
God, after Acā the sonne of Carmi,
of whom I spake before, had transgressed
his holy precepte by takyng
of the excommunicate goodes, commaunded
Iosue, that he should sanctify
the people, & 
                  •
               yd thē sanctifye

them selues before they wente ony
more to battell, & kyll hym, whyche
had so trāsgressed agenst the Lord.
For whā that was done, they prosperred
tryumphantly euer after in
all theyr warres, & God gaue theyr
enemies into theyr hādes, & they enioyed
the lond in peasable possession.
Although this sanctifyeng of ye Israelites
dyd cōsist in externall ceremonies,
as in wasshyng, purgyng &
c
                  •
               ensynge them from the fylthynes
of both theyr bodyes & garmentes, &
in abstayning from the company of
theyr wiues, yet shadoweth it to vs
also our māner of sāctifyēg, whiche
is spiritual.Howe we oughte to sanctifye our selues. It requireth of vs that
we should purge our selues of all iniquite, wash awaye the fylthynes of
our hartes, & put from vs all carnal
cōcupiscēces & fleshly lustes, so that
we may be cleane both in body and
soule, & be founde worthy to haue

God our captayne. They that thus
sanctify them selues, are fytte to go
vnto the warre of the Lorde.
            
            
               God gaue a commaundement to
the Israelites & sayd,Deut. xxiii. whan thou goest
out wyth the hoost agenst thyne
enemies, kepe the from all wyckednes,
for the Lorde is among you. If
there be ony man that is vnclene by
the reason of vnclennes, that chaū
                  seth
hym by nyght, let hym go oute
of the hoost, & not come in agen vntyll
he haue washed hymselfe wythe
water before the euen: & than whan
the sonne is downe, let hym come in
to the hoost agen. Thou shalte haue
a place wythout the hoost whyther
thou shalte resorte to, & thou shalte
haue a sharpe poynte at the ende of

in thyn hoost to rydde the, and

thyn boost therfore be pure, that he

for the heal the & safegarde of theyr

but only to defende theyr Empyre,
and to enlarge the boundes and limites
therof.
            Howe Christen men prepare thē
selues vnto the warres,How christē men prepare them selues vnto battell. it is more
open than it nede here to be expressed.
As I maye speake nothynge of
suche as go wyth an euell wyll vnto
the battel. What a nomber goeth
there only to pycke, steale, robbe, &
that they maye come home agayne
well ladē with spoyles & robberies?
Howe lytle respecte haue they vnto
the conseruacion & defence of theyr
natiue countrey, so that theyr packes
may be wel enfarsed, laden and
stuffed? What dysyng, cardyng, and
all kynde of volupteous royot is vsed
among them? What dryncking,
gullynge, quaffynge & superfluous
banckettyng do they vse? What manacyng,
brawlyng, chydyng, & fyghtyng

is heard & sene dayly amonge
them?The wicked nes of Soul diours in y• warres. What whoredome is there cō
               mytted
among them? What mayde
escapeth vndefloured? What wyfe
departeth vnpolluted, as I may ad
nothyng here vnto? What abhominable
swearyng is vsed among thē?
How is God rent and torne among
them by vnlawfull othes? How desyrous
are they to shed bloude, and
to make hauocke of altogyther?
            The rapacite of wolfes, the violēce
of lyons, the fearsenes of tygres, is
nothyng in comparison of theyr furious
& cruell tyranny, & yet do many
of thē this, not for the safegarde
of theyr countrey (for so myghte it
seme the more tollerable) but for to
satisfy theyr bocherlyke affectes, to
boaste another daye, of howe many
men they haue bene the death, & to
brynge home the mo prayes, y• they
maye lyue the fatter euer after for

those spoyles and stollen goodes.
            As concernyng the inuocacion &
callyng on the name of God, it is so
farre out of remēbraunce, that many
of them do not so muche as once
thyncke or dreame of it. Howe is it
possible, that these warres shoulde
prosper, where there is no regard of
god, no respecte to honeste no desyre
of mutuall concorde, no endeuoure
employed to make God mercyfull
vnto vs. Surely these warryours
had nede to sanctify them selues, or
els they be not defēders but destroyers
of the common weale, for ye safegard
wherof they wyl seme to fight
For be theyr valeaunce & myght neuer
so stronge, yet can they not prosper,
if God blysse not theyr labours
as we heard before.Howe the Souldiours ought to prepare thē selues vnto battell. It is therfore expedient,
that they whiche shall prepare
them selues vnto battell, and
offer theyr lyues for the wealthe of

theyr coūtrey, sanctify them selues,
I meane, expurge and put away all
vnclennes, & wicked behauour both
of body and mynde, and so appoynt
them selues in euery condicion, as
though the tyme were come, y• euen
now they should departe out of this
worlde, and render an accomptes of
theyr lyfe here spent.
            They maye not go vnto y• warres,
as tyraūtes, whose hartes imagine
miscefe, whose mouthes breath

lyonlyke crudelite, whose handes de

dyd not prouoke them vnto it, for

moch as they are fyrst prouoked yee

is no priuate iniury, but a common
wrong to inuade ony Realme, and
to disturbe the inhabitauntes therof,

But he that workethe the

            Another sorte of people there are

make moche of it, shewyng them selues
so feruent, that they wyll seme

& chose rather to be fed wyth the

fall they agen vnto theyr olde blyndnes,
so that this cōmon sayeng may

and euell spoken of amonge the

to that sonne, whiche promysed hys
father,Math. xxi. that he woulde worke in his

what do I? If I shulde go forth to
declare the abhominable wickednesses
that raygne nowe in the worlde
vniuersally, I shoulde neuer make
an ende, thoughe I had an hondred

the Poet sayth.Psal. xiii. All are fallen out of

               Where such a wycked sorte is at

neuer so good and vertuous, howe
can God fyght for thē? If God had
pleasure in wyckednes, if God dyd

But seyng that he hateth all them

If we do, surely it is gyuē vs for the

praye you? By whose valeaūs was

scripture sayth: Whā Moses lyfted
vp his hādes, Israel dyd ouercome,
but if he dyd let hys handes downe
neuer so lytyll, than had Amelech y•
better. Therfore whan Moses handes
were wery, Aharon & Hur toke
a stonne and put it vnder hym, and
he sate downe theron. And Aharon
and Hur steyed vp hys handes, the
one on the one syde, the other on the
other syde. And it cam to passe, that

               o, God the father by Salomō speaketh

on this manner:

I haue called & ye refused it, I haue
stretched out my hand, and no man

myne eyes from you, and whan ye

shall be styll bablynge of your prayers,
I wyll not heare you. Therfore
whē we entend to pray, let vs bring
with vs repentaūce, sayth, & amendment
of lyfe, so may we be sure to be
hearde.
            The sermon once done, let them
fall earnestly vnto prayer, & desyre
God wyth one mynde to be mercyful
vnto the countrey, as I taught
before.
            After the prayers let euery man
quietly returne home euer bearing
in his mynde the safegard of his cō
               trey
with a continuall eleuacion of
hys harte vnto God for y• welth of
the same. And let them so behaue
them selues, y• God may be pleased
wyth them. And as they haue promysed
God to become newe men so
let them walke in a newe lyfe, euery
man doynge hys office accordynge
to hys vocacion & callyng. For yf after

our prayers and the promisse of
amendement of lyfe,Note. we returne agayne
vnto oure olde wyckednesse,
what other thynge do we, than prouoke
God vnto anger, mocke him, &
seake the very destruccion of our cō
               trey.
Lette vs therfore be the very
same in dede, that we haue promised
in worde. So shall it come to passe
assuredly, that God shall be in oure
army, fyght for vs, strengthen oure
Souldiours, chase awaye our enemies,
and giue vs y• victory, so that
nether Turke, Iewe, Saracen, nor
any other Tyraūt shall may be able

which he hath giuē vs. And whā
they be once come home, let the people
gather togyther, & the preacher
make a solemne sermon vnto them,
declaring how greatly we are boūd
to God for this tryumphant victory
that he hath gyuē vs, and exhortynge
them to be thanckefull agen
to God for inestimable kyndenes.

that by hys omnipotent power

warres sayd to the Athenians, whā
they meruelled greatly at hys prosperous
chaūse, and praysed hym because
he hadde slayne kynge Cotys:
There is no thancke, sayth he, to he

               who beyng the Author, thys acte is
very nobly done. As for me, I dyd
none other thynge but put my helpynge
hande and diligence vnto it.
God alone gaue the victory, to hym
therfore be all the thācke, prayse, honour
and glory.
            
            We read also in diuers places of
the holy Scripture, that after God
had gyuen the victory to his people
ouer theyr enemies, they brast oute
streyght wayes īto prayses, & gaue
God harty thanckes, as we rede of
the chyldren of Israel at theyr delyueraunce
out of Egypt, which whā
they sawe theyr enemy kynge Pharao
wyth all his army drowned in y•
see,Exo. xv. and them selues preserued, what
goodly songes, lawdes and prayses,

and his army put to flyght, what a
goodly songe dyd IudithIudith. xvi. synge to y•
Lorde? Howe ioyfully came all the
people togither vnto Ierusalem for
to gyue prayse & thākes vnto theyr
Lord God, and to offer theyr burnt
sacrifices and promysed offeringes?
            After thexample of these deuout
and holy parsonnes ought we also,
whā we haue gotten the victory, to
gyue God thanckes, and to offer the
Sacrifice of prayse vnto hym. So
shal we shewe our selues not vnworthy
hys beneficence, yea so shall we
prouoke God to continewe a gentle
& fauourable Lorde vnto vs, when
he shall perceyue that we be thāckefull,
and do not forget his inestimable
benefites, which he dayely sheweth
vnto vs.
            Nowe remayneth the laste parte

we maye enioye peace and tranquilite

that the cause, why God plageth vs
eyther with warres, pestilēce or hō

is Idolatry, false worshyppyng
                  •
               
of God, y• despisyng of Christes gospell,
wycked lyuyng, effeminate mā

&c. Nowe if we wyll be fre frō
these plages, and lyue in rest & quiet,
we muste cease to commyt suche
greuous synnes agaynst God, and
seake both to serue hym accordyng
to his word, and also to lead a pure
