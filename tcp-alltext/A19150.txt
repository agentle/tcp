               MOST GRACIOVS and DREAD SOVERAIGNE,
            
            
               MAY it pleaſe Your MAIESTIE, out of your Princely Clemency, which exceeding all things, yet enclaſpes the leaſt, to vouchſafe to theſe poore labours (true Benoni-es, the ſonnes of my ſorrow, ſo many diſaſters haue annoyed them from the wombe, and ſome with the perill of their parents life) the skirt of your royall cloathing, or but the ſhadow of your

skirt, Acceptance with Patronage: 
               Ʋndertaken at firſt by your MAIESTIES commandement, for the repulſing of the lewde ſlaunders of a nameleſſe Papiſt, and to redeeme the credit of a renowmed Biſhop; but continued to the confirmation of Your MAIESTIES leige people, in their Reiligion to GOD, and their Obedience to your MAIESTIE, with all ſubiection. In quibus duobus, vniuerſa Lex pendet, & Prophetae, (to ſpeake it in his words, whoſe doctrine it was moſt, yea whoſe onely errand it was, as Hegeſippus teſtifies) I meane, in ſeeking the face of GOD, and his IACOB, as ſome euen Papiſts haue noted vpon that Pſalme, that they are diſtinguiſhed there not without cauſe, and the one is conſequent, or to be conſequent, to the other.
            But not ſo the Cardinall (the more too blame he) a maine ſtickler in theſe Controuerſies (after the Pope and the Pioners) that encomber the world; and I know not by what lucke, though Ceruini generis animal, yet Your MAIESTIES audacious concurrent in the cauſe. Who if he were younger, perhaps hee might be borne with, either fancying his ſuperſtitions, or foſtering his ſeditions: As the Stoicke Philoſopher was wont to ſay, that a young man at Sea, if hee abandon the Shippe to walke aſhoare a while, and either digge ſome roote, or gather ſome ſhell which the Sea caſts forth, there is no danger in it; but in an olde man it is dangerous, whome death, and ſickeneſſe, and ſundry caſualties may preuent, from euer recouering ſhip againe. Yet he in his deuouteſt meditations of all other, his booke laſt ſet forth de Aeterna Faelicitate, will not excuſe Kings from beeing murthered de iure, (not onely de facto) onely hee paſſes it ouer as a caſus omiſſus, happily becauſe anouched in his other Volumes more peremptorily.
            Of another minde was his Vnckle, of whome hee brags in one place, conteſting with your MAIESTIE, (though S. Chryſoſtome note, that S. Pauls ſiſters ſonne, of whome there is mention in the Acts, was neuer a whit the bleſſeder for his Ʋnckles vertue, and as it may ſeeme neuer any good came of him; ſaue onely that he reuealed the Iewes conſpiracie againſt Paul, which this man would rather defend the concealing of) but Marcellus ſecundus,
               
of whome I was ſaying, (witneſſe the Hiſtorian that alleadges friendſhip (for more faith) and ſome intimitie wit

(himſelfe hauing been lately Cardinall Sanctae Crucis.) And in particular of the Pope, Pontificem maximum neutiquam indigere, aut ſcutis, aut gladijs (indeede Athanaſius remooues all iron from the Apoſtles, and S. Auſten will not haue them ſtrike, though they may carrie weapons, ferre ferrum, but not ferire) ſatiuſ

                   eſſe ipſum ſi res ferat occîdi, quàm tam indecorum exemplum praeberi Eccleſiae, namely as for the Pope either to handle a ſword, or giue allowance to others, at his direction, ſo to doe.
            So as no maruell, if the ſame man, conſidering the practiſes of ſuch as were Popes in his time, clapt his hand once vpon the table, proteſting in great earneſtnes, that it ſeemed impoſſible for a Pope (as things then went) to be ſaued. And another ſaies, it was the voice of almoſt all men in thoſe daies, that a Pope could not be ſaued, when this Marcellus came to it. I know not what cōtentment the Cardinall may take in his new skarlet-additions, which they would make vs beleeue he accepted of ſo lothly; but for my part, I ſhould thinke one day of his Vnckles, (as Tullie ſaies of Antonie, compared with his grandfather) were more to be deſired, then a whole age of the Cardinalls, lending his pen and bending his wit to the defence of ſuch trumperies, and, which is worſe, of ſuch treacheries, as are now in vre with them; the diſlike whereof, and onely intended Reformation, coſt his Ʋnckle his life, and that in very ſhort ſpace, after he came to the Popedome.
            Of whome, becauſe I haue ſaid ſo much, almoſt before I was aware, I will not 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , trouble Your Royall eare (as that Councell ſpeakes, which forbids Clerks to diſturbe Kings, not onely in their ſtates, or liues, (as now the faſhion is,) but ſo much as in their leiſures:) onely this it may pleaſe Your MAIESTIE
               
giue me leaue to adde, That the Pope whome I ſpeake of (as Onu
                     •…
                  us teſtifies) OMNEM ECCLESIASTICAM IVRISDICTIONEM, viris profanis, & nullis ſacris initiatis, demandare cogitaverat; had a purpoſe to tranſlate all Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction to meere Lay-men: he calls them profane; but the more vehemently he expreſſes it, the more it makes for vs, and againſt themſelues: the Papiſts all ſo ſtorming at the thing this day, and the Adioynder by name (with whome therefore I haue a dealing about this point ſomewhat at large) in Your MAIESTIES high Prerogatiue, and iuſteſt Title; allowing You, by no meanes, Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction: (if happily You ſhould euer fulfil their ſuſpicion of owning it:) Though KINGS were ſo farre from beeing counted profane, by the auncient Synods of CHRISTS Church, that their letters were holy to them, their ſyllables holy, their palace holy, their very bed-chamber holy, and all that was about them, or belonged to them, ſacred and holy, in the ſtyle of thoſe godly times, and Fathers.
            Where I cannot but obſerue, the prouidence of GOD, that requites humane actions, and how euen a courſe it keepes with our courſes. For as the intents were good, which Marcellus foſtered, but no effects followed, nay rather his Nephew drawes now backe moſt of all, and mainly oppoſes his Vnckles determinations: So we read, that the Cardinalls in fauour of his perſon (becauſe reputed honeſt, and well be loued amongst them) decreed to haue his charges of the direption of his houſe and houſhold ſtuffe, (a graue cuſtome no doubt, and worthie of Chriſts Vicar, to haue all rifled, and ranſackt, that the people can but lay hands of, when he is choſen Pope) to be repaid him of the publique; but it was neuer done (ſaith the Hiſtorian) till this day.
            But to leaue the Vnckle (ſith our queſtion is not whether the Popes may keepe guards about their perſons, but whether Kings crownes, or (if that be more deare) their liues are to be wholly at the Popes dispoſing) and to returne to the Nephew; He is peremptorie, as I ſaid, in his moſt mortified Treatiſe, and the fore-runner of his ende (as he would haue it thought at leaſt) that Kings are

ſubiect to murther, at beſt: Firſt, de facto; though the Scripture as it flatters not, nor no where diuerts vs from the conſideration of our mortality, ſo it leades vs to ſpeake of KINGS and Princes in another ſtraine; as if they that ought not to be violated by any mortall hand, could not die at all, or at leaſt not die, till God himſelfe aſſoild them of the bands of this bodie. How was he ſlaine (ſaies Dauid of Saul) as if he had not beene annointed with oyle? And, O King, liue for euer, ſaies the Prophet Daniel, not any courtly flatterer. The Kings ſoule is bound vp with God in the bundle of life, as it were Gero in ſinu, nec diſcingor; faſt bound, and not to ſhedde out. The period of their gouernment, is cum Sole & Luna, as long as the Sunne and Moone endureth. And though they die like men, (that is, quatenus homines, non quatenus Reges) yet we are to remember, that they fall like one of the PRINCIPES, that is, one of the Angels (ſaies the Cardinall himſelfe, among others, vpon that Pſalme) who we know are not iudged, till GOD iudges them: though, no doubt but that aggrauates their iudgement ſo much the forer.
            And whereas the Scripture ſo often, entitles the conſtitution of Kings to GOD, it may be it is to ſhew, that their authoritie is inabrogable; as the Platoniques hold opinion, that whatſoeuer is mortall, was produced by ſome mediation of the vile creature, as man of the duſt, moſt things of the materia prima, &c. but that which immediatly proceedes of God himſelfe, as the ſoules of men, and the Angells, and the heauens, they are immortall. So of Princes.
            Yet the Cardinall not content with a death de facto, implyes that they may be ſlaine de iure too, though he affirme vpon the other onely, which belike was enough to ſerue his turne in that place. No more Ceruinus now, nor of the mothers breed (which was the better of the two) but 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               —as Conſtantine beſpake Arius in the Nicene Councell, ſomewhat merrily; for the one hath Mars, the other warre, and weapons, and threats in his name; and as the one oppoſed the naturall, ſo the other the myſticall Chriſt, he in his perſon, this in his offices and principall officers; but each of thē to the moſt lamentable embroyling of Chrſts

Church. And as the one of them was quelled by the Imperiall Conſtantine, iudicially proceeding, and Synodically ſentencing him, with his band of three hundred and eighteene Biſhops; So againſt the other, God hath excited Your moſt excellent MAIESTIE, but without the trouble or labour of an Eccleſiaſtique Synode, to ouerthrow him by YOVR pen, and the pen of one onely Biſhop of Your many; yet worth many, where all moſt worthy.
            And albeit Your MAIESTIE needes no Defender, abounding with ſo many continually about Your Perſon, guarding the bed, and girding to them the ſword (as the Spouſe ſpeakes) (beſides Your owne inherent puiſſance inuincible) yet becauſe what I haue now vttered concerning the Cardinall and his mortified propoſitions (croſſing with Your MAIESTIES both State and Honour, as much as may bee) I haue vttered it with the priuitie of many of Your leige people, (whom I confeſſe, as before, that my eſpeciall care hath been to confirme, and whereof ſome perhaps will not diſdaine to caſt their eies vpon theſe papers, if at leaſt they may paſſe with Your MAIESTIES approbation) it were worth the conſidering, what correſpondence ſuch grounds haue with the auncient doctrine, which the Cardinall and his followers would ſeeme ſo cloſe to follow. Of Chryſoſtome, for one, That a Soueraigne King is accountable to none (not onely to his Subiects, but) not ſo much as to his Succeſſor, (as Dauid ſaid euen now, that he is to be iudged like the Angels, that is, by God, and by God onely, and neither liuing nor dead by any other:) The ſame Chryſoſtome againe noting in another place, that where as the Pſalmiſt paſſes ouer other miracles of the wilderneſſe in deepe ſilence, he inſiſts onely vpon the death of Og and Sehon, two mightie Monarches; becauſe Kings liues are ſo wholly in Gods hands, and the diſpoſition of them is alway miraculous, reſerued and appropriated to God himſelfe. Of Baſil, That a King is ſubiect to no Iudge: Of Ambroſe, that nullis tenetur legibus, not onely the King of Iſrael, but not the King of Egypt: Or (becauſe the Papiſts make his caſe the worſe of the two, that ſhould bee the better in all reaſon,) not onely the King of Egypt, but not the King of Iſrael; for he ſaies it of both of

thē, & in two ſeuerall places. Of that Pope in Theodoret (Anaſtaſius I take it) who perſecuting Flauian (as his Predeceſſours had done for a long time before) Theodoſius that was their arbiter, bidde the Pope let goe Flauian (becauſe hee ſawe there was malice) and argue againſt himſelfe, as if he were Flauian, giuing him good leaue to ſay what hee could. To whome that Pope moſt ſubmiſſely; We may not doe ſo, if pleaſe your Maieſtie, it is not lawfull for vs to implead a King; not onely in his perſon, but not perſonating another, not fictione iuris, as the Lawyers ſay. Yea the verie heathen Poet, and one of the wretchedeſt, yet he had ſo much grace in him, as to make ſeruants thē
               ſelues ſafe vnder a Crowne (though worne not for Soueraignty, but for Solemnity onely, as was the faſhion in their feſtiuals) 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . As for that which follows, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , &c. it is right the doctrine of our moderne Ieſuites concerning Kings, that if firſt they be decrowned, then they may be vſed, no longer as Kings, but as priuate men, that is, abuſed at pleaſure. Euen the Cardinall himſelfe opens his eyes at laſt, (the caſe is ſo cleare) and acknowledges as much. The STEVVARD of a houſe (ſaies he) may be depoſed by none, but only by the grand-maſter of the Family: which is God in the world, as the Steward in the State is the King, by analogie. Not but that his meaning is as trayterous as euer (for he vnderſtands it of his Pope) but I ſuppoſe Your MAIESTIES name was partly fatall to giue him light (which is the character of Supremacy engrauen in you by God) and partly it confirmes my opinion of him, that if Your MAIESTES Bookes and rare trauailes in this cauſe (out of which we all take, that now write any thing) had been but read of him when he was young, and afore he was embondaged in this damnable preiudice, he would haue yeelded to the ſpirit and power which they are fraught with, acknowledged your proofes, ſubmitted to your reaſons, admired Your MAIESTIES & cor & linguam; and finally thanked God for him his conuerter, whom now he is faine to endure his confuter. But, longa dies quid non captiuat? making vs, as S. Chryſoſtome ſayes, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , to preferre euen garlicke before Ambroſia.
            
               
But although not he (froward as he is) yet there are others infinite both forreiners & domeſticks, that profit by Your MAIESTIES peereleſſe writings daily; not onely to the enlarging of their skill and knowledge (whereof your Works may ſeeme to be an Vniuerſall Seminarie) but to their redeeming from ruine (which Vn-ſubiection drawes to) and building them vp to euerlaſting ſaluation in the world to come, with quiet mindes and content in this preſent, which before they wanted. And truely our hope is, that the Rights which Your MAIESTIE ſhall tranſmitt to your poſteritie, as nobly cleared by Your pen, as euer they were wonne by your Auncestors ſwords, will both breed much peace to the Land in generall, and great ſecurity to Your royall offspring the inheritours, confuſion to the aduerſaries, and barkers againſt Soueraignty; euen as long as either learning ſhall be held in price, or a man ſhall be left aliue to reuolue bookes.
            Whereof becauſe this worke purſues the remainders, and treads the ſame way, though in a moſt improportionable diſtance, once againe imploring Your MAIESTIES ſacred Patronage, worthie to be a Sanctuarie to a greater trespaſſer) both out of Your loue to the cauſe, and out of Your loue to the coate, (which is ſo great and ſo gratious, as no fame will be ſo niggard, but to record it to the furtheſt enſuing ages,) I beſeech the GOD of ALL things, euen for his deare SONNES ſake, (which is our hope, and our glorie, defending Your MAIESTIE, and by Your MAIESTIE defended) to accōpliſh his rare Graces vpon Your MAIESTIES Royall Head: Or, in ſtead of augmenting them, to adde but this one more bleſſing, to the many that he hath multiplied, ſuper virum dextrae ſuae, ſuper Regem

From which this man is ſo farre, that like the Orators in Tullie, who the worſe they ſpake, the lowder they cried, & whom therefore he compares to lame riders, that not able to goe on foote, would needes be prauncing on horſebacke; ſo he mends his ſtature by a falſe ſhooe, as it were, and as another Publican after Matthaeus Tortus, climbes the ſycomore of his owne wild fancies, to ouerlooke the croudes: or like the painters boy, that beeing to paint Helen, cùm pulchram pingere non poſſet, pinxit diuitem; ſo what he lacks in learning, he laies on load in lies, in taunts, in tearmes, and in abominable raylings. Which for my part, I cannot ſee what effect it is like to haue, with the iudicious Readers, if at leaſt any ſuch caſt their eyes vpon theſe pamphlets, (for we are not ignorant to what kind of people they are conſecrated) then to ſtrippe them quite of all credit, and euen pitch them ouer

Pope of theirs was ſo addicted to newes, as he cared not what it were, ſo it tickled his eare, and digeſted falſe, as well as true, (whome the Cardinall it ſeemes, imitates, for all the world, beleeuing whatſoeuer our runnagates bring him concerning Engliſh affaires, hauing quite loſt his common ſenſe, and not able to diſtinguiſh between ſeuerall obiects, if any whit ſemblable;) I ſay, to giue thee a taſt of this mans ſpirit, wee will goe no further then his owne writings, and among them, then this booke, that we preſently deale with, ſhall affoard inſtruction. Whereby his Vanitie, his Virulencie, his Ignorance, and his Circumſtance, beeing ſufficiently diſcouered, though we leaue no part of the whole vnexamined, (euen contrarie to iniunction, as our Sauiours example was not to anſwer Pilate to euery Contra Celſum in initio. 2. King. 18. queſtion, as Origen well notes, and ſo Ezechias to ſay nothing to Rabſace, but to let him goe as he came with a flea in his eare, for all his flaunting) yet perhaps this Preface might either ſatisfie the cauſe without thy farther labour, or at leaſt ſo ſettle thy iudgement in reading, as to conceiue

hereby the better, of that which is anſwered in due place, to his barbarous imputations.
            
                And firſt, for his 
                  Ʋanitie: it is worth the conſidering, how euery where he couples himſelfe with the Cardinall, and ſometimes iets before him, ſometimes behind him, like the fantaſticke wooer that Ouid deſcribes,
Et modò praecedit, ſequitur modò—
               Places (ſaies he) alleadged by the Cardinall and my ſelfe. p. 68. The Law inter Claras alleadged both by the Cardinall and by me. p. 38. Twelue Fathers alleadged by the Cardinall and me. p. 356. The like you may ſee, p. 112. p. 245. and diuerſe more, for I ſpare. Another time, as diuiding the praiſe betweene them two, partly by the Cardinall, and partly by me, ſaies he, p. 304. But moſt ridiculous, where he goes before him, nothing aſhamed, yea and enters into compariſon with him too, very deftly. Firſt, for action. Obiected (ſaies he) as well by me, as by 
               Pag. 1. And in the very front and titlepage of his booke, Pl

               the Cardinall, as if he could follow an argument, as well as the Cardinall. Againe a paſſiue. Pag. 39. 
               The Biſhops anſwer to S. Cyprian (ſaies he) makes as much againſt me, as againſt the Cardinall. And many ſuch like feathers of his frantique ambition, euery where ſcattered throughout the worke. Which had beene vncouth in any, to haue aſſociated himſelfe with another writer of fame, eſpecially the Cardinall, where no neede was, and in a treatiſe no way depending on his, though happily falling The Cardinall himſelfe, hath taken as much into his Controuerſies, out of other mens writings, as any: and yet is wiſer then to appeale them, or to make words of thē. But no doubt the Adioynder would haue vs thinke that good wits iumpt, the Cardinall, and his, about the inuention of the ſame argument. into diuers the ſame points, which he had handled before, (as what is there in Diuinitie, which ſome author or other hath not foreſtalled? and yet wee doe not name them, nor ranke our ſelues with them, when we proſecute the ſame argument:) but more ſtrange in F. T. a man no way knowne, no way heard of, much leſſe bearing any ſuch reputation, patched vp (as they ſay) lately out of father Parſons his relliques, his leaden ſtandiſh, and his wodden canſticke, (another Pſeud-Epictetus) and perhaps ſome olde notes of his muſtie paper-booke, otherwiſe among

a thouſand the vnlikelieſt that could be gueſt at, to beare a head with the Cardinall, or to ſucceede him, as his Yet F. Parſons bought skarlet in hope to be a Cardinall, as the Seculars write of him. And this man would bee knowne to ſucceede F. Parſons.
                former flouriſhes import to be his owne conceit of himſelfe. I might adde hereto his craking euery where of his Supplement, whereof this is but a ribbe, an Eue taken out of the others ſide, as our Prometheus intimates, As I haue noted in my Supplement, ſaies he, p. 15. and, As I haue ſhewed in my Supplement, p. 36. I haue produced in my Supplement, p. 39. Hauing occaſion in my Supplement, p. 98. So 139. 415. 417. So in many other places we are told of the Supplement, that is, by himſelfe of his owne worke, (another qualitie ſomewhat vnuſuall among writers, that are not ſtarke madde, to beat vpon their own, eſpecially ſo often) which you may thinke how good a Supplement, or how anſwerable to the title, when wee ſhould not haue knowne it to be at all, but for this frequent ſupplie of his owne mouth. And yet for my part I neuer ſaw it, I conſeſſe, neither know I any that look after it. If it be like this, no force: here is enough to make Catullus ſicke, or his horſe either, and once againe to bethinke him, how he may recure his ſurfet with purgatiue herbes, ocymo

                  Ʋanitie, as you may remember, which appeares by theſe two points, his marching with the Cardinall in ſuch 1 2 wanton equipage, as hath beene ſhewed, and his calling out vpon his Supplement, though this alſo be a fruit of his moſt hateful Tediouſnes to come in it with ſo often; of which anon.
            
                The ſecond is his 
                  Ʋirulency, which you may take vp by handfulls. I will not draine the fenne, or ſtand caſting the ponde, I meane ranſacke his booke by quoting the pages; but his Table of principall matters ſhall declare what I ſay, which himſelfe hath adioyned to the end of his Adioynder; the fourth principall in the table. I omit how he ſtrippes the Biſhop of his title; And (not to ſay how due in all other mens iudgements, the moſt iudicious themſelues thinking

that they honour their iudgments moſt, when they expreſſe the honour that they beare to him) it was not denied to Dioſcorus (I forbeare the reſt, how vnſutable a man) yet drawing neere, (as he beſt knowes that cites the Councell Adioynd. cap. 2. toto. Act 3. Concil. Calched. at large) vpon the point of degradation, to be tearmed Reuerendiſſimus, & Deo chariſſimus, Epiſcopus, the moſt Reuerend Biſhop, and moſt beloued of God, at euery word. But what ſtyle doth he giue him, in liew of the other, which he takes from him? Let it be viewed, where I now quoted, (like Tertullians Ononychites, that he tells vs of in his Apologeticus, ſet vp by the Heathen, in deſpight of the Chriſtians, or if euer any imagination croſt the originall more fowly.) His vaine bragges, His cogging the dice, his inclining to Iudaiſme, A man prodigall of his Rhetorique, &c. Yea, a wronger of his MAIESTIE, turnd plains Puritane, no friend to the Supremacie. And then ouer againe with the ſame notes, not onely in the booke, but in the Index twice, ſo well they pleaſe him. Fooles bolts, Shuttlecocks, dull head, &c. Finally, will you heare an heinous crime? He tryes how neare he can corne to Popery, and yet miſſe it: that is, graunts to the Papiſts as much as may be graunted, though by no meanes betraying the Palladium of Gods cauſe, multiplyes not controuerſies, where no need is, abſtaines from brabbles, and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , as ſhould the ſeruant of God (if S. Paul

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               , as S. Baſile forewarnes; but ioyning Charity with Piety, diſcretion with reſolution, imitates the driuers at the Olympian games, whoſe praiſe was to come neare, and yet not to touch.
            Now truely hauing deſcribed to you, his deſcription of the Biſhop, wherein, beſides his Virulency, (of which I now entreat,) both his Vanity and Tautology, and almoſt all appeares, that before I charged him with, euen Ignorance it ſelfe in the higheſt degree (for what more groſſe ignorance, then to be ignorant of the perſon (not only of the generall,

or of the cauſe) whome the fartheſt parts know, farre other then ſo? vnleſſe purpoſely he would decypher him like Arbos inuerſa, as the Philoſophers ſay of man, or by negagations and abſtractions, as we doe the Genij in Metaphyſiques) me thinks he hath giuen you a deſcription of a Ieſuite, ſuch as a better could not be wiſhed, that ſhewes you the world cleane turnd in a glaſſe, and preſumes he can alter the very nature of things, with his poiſonous breath, and partiall cenſure: not vnlike to their late ſcholler, the parricide of France, that conceited the king to be an Aethiop

                The third is his Ignorance, and I meane onely in the Latine  tongue; for I will not ſearch now his more hidden ſchollerſhip; I am content to be iudged by his knowledge in the entry, in the verie portall (for ſo is that to learning, prima de dòtibus, or, prima de cotibus.) (And as for the Greeke, we were not beſt ſay much of that, though his

Firſt,  pag. 40. id eſt, cap. 2. num. 3. becauſe the Biſhop had ſaid, Legat canone inuſtum, ne maiora, ſed aequalia, ſint priuilegia, &c. he thus; Whereas he ſaies, that the Councell of Calchedon, did by that Canon giue to the Biſhop of Conſtantinople, ne maiora, ſed aequalia priuilegia, &c. Which though it be the preſeruing of the word ne in both places, yet euery meane Latiniſt eaſily ſees, that ne ſhould haue been turned into non in the latter place, if he meant any ſenſe ſhould be in his ſentence, as he began it. And therefore, I can impure it to nothing, but his lacke of skill in the rudiments. But let this goe for nothing,

if I make it not appeare yet plainer, that he is minus habens, and all too light, as he ſpeakes of the Biſhop in an other place, (for ſuch reuerence he beares him.) Pag. 42.  that is,  cap. 2. num. 6. thus we haue. It is ſaid expreſſely of the Church of Conſtantinople, that it ſhould be magnified and extolled as olde Rome was, ſecundam poſt illam exiſtentem. Which is the letter, I grant, in the Councell of Calchedon, but almoſt killing Priſcian, as hee ſets it downe, for ſecunda poſt illam exiſtens; the Church of Conſtantinople (to which that referres) being eccleſia, not eccleſiam, in his period, and ſo to be tranſlated, if it were to be put into Latine,  I ſay nothing of his  conſtruing S. Auſtens words, ſimply God knowes, p. 149.

                Neither onely  can he not skill of the language himſelfe, but marres the Biſhops Latine with his addle corruptions, Concludit teſtas ſuos cum Auguſtine, ſayes he, p. 145. as quoting his words, which in the booke is ſome what otherwiſe, Concludit teſtes ſuos Auguſtino.

But becauſe he knew not the other ſenſe of the word obſtrepo, (as in Tully pro Marcello, obſtrepi videntur militum clamore & tubarum ſono) therefore he commits this ſolaeciſme in tranſlating.

But by this you ſee the cauſe why he anſwers the Latine booke with his Engliſh, becauſe he thinkes the Biſhop is not his crafts maſter in the Latine, and ſo he will take no aduantage againſt him, but deales with him in Engliſh, as one Engliſhman ſhould with another, the vnknowne tongue beeing better for deuotion, not for diſputation.
            
            
                Laſtly, whereas the Biſhop ſpeakes of Peters diſeaſe, which  S. Auſten had firſt toucht vpon, namely of confidence in himſelfe, and too much ouerweening, ſo as he ſtucke not to ſay, Et ſi omnes non ego; to which the Biſhop addes for explication ſake, id eſt, plus ego quàm omnes, (which is the verie thing that they attribute to S. Peter at this day, to bee the 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                of the Apoſtles, and worth them all: as alſo it followes out of his owne words, for, if though all not he, then he is of more worth or force then they all) this lither fellow, this exos aſinus, not ſo good as Iſſachar, an aſſe without bones, without proofe, without mettall, conſtrues it thus, out of the fulneſſe of his Latine, That, though all other Diuines

               would giue ouer attempting the Popes cure, yet ſo would not the Biſhop; et ſi omnes non ego. A likely ſpeech to be vttered by that graue Prelate, concerning himſelfe, eſpecially with the diſparagement of the reſt of our Diuines, for ſo is his diſpoſition, as they knowe that know him. But how doe you

thinke he falls vpon this ſenſe? what pucke lead him out of the way? Becauſe the Biſhop had ſaid a little before, Praeſertim cùm eundem morbum in capite veſtro notârint diu iam medicorum filij; Medicorum filij; ſaies he, are Beza, and Caluin; for the olde heretiques were the medici, as the Donatiſts, &c. (whom the Papiſts nothing reſemble, neither reſtraining Kings from medling with Church-matters, nor ſhutting vp the Church within a corner of the world, &c.) and theſe their ſonnes. Then followeth, Etſi omnes, non ego, 
                     •
                  1. plus ego quàm omnes: which in the Biſhops booke referres to the morbum before ſpoken of, S. Peters diſeaſe conſiſting in theſe words, a diſeaſe of pride. But what does our Gentleman? He diuides etſi into two words, & and ſi, and then makes an interrogatiue at ego, conſtruing it thus, Et ſi omnes, non ego? And if all doe, ſhall not I? if all phyſicke the Pope, ſhall not I? To which you may thinke now how handſomly that ſuites which followes, id eſt, plus ego quàm omnes: as if the Biſhop when he had asked that queſtion by way of challenge, ſhould expreſſe himſelfe, for more perſpicuitie ſake, by an id eſt, that is to ſay, I am more worth then they all. Theſe are the fopperies of this great gull. And you ſee howe profound an vnderſtander of the Latine, that is faine to point the Biſhops words anew, with his ſenſeleſſe interrogatiues, before he can conſtrue them, or miſconſtrue them rather; as likewiſe to diuide them, and to clip them, by turning etſi into et ſi; but laſtly, to deuiſe a difference, between medici, and medicorum filij, a moſt palpable demonſtration of his vnmatchable dunſerie, and not vnlike the boyes in the Grammar ſchoole, that conſtrued pullus equinus, a horſechicken. Now crie for Elleboron Sir, now preſcribe Catholicon,

As for the drug Catholicon, that intoxicates the braine, and prickes on to murther, and to combuſtion in States, it is a drug for your ſelfe, and for your fellowes, if they haue not too much already.

                For I paſſe by that, that he ſo conſtrues the Biſhops  words (referring to S. Peter) plus ego quàm omnes, as if S. Peter had been more ſcandalized then they all, cap. 4. num. 33. Yet this is his Latine, plus ſcandalizatus, for more ſcandalized. Which though by the rules of his Caetholicon, may paſſe for currant, not ſo by the touchſtone of the more accurate Grā
               marians, who happily would no more ſay plus ſcandalizatus, for more ſcandalized, then plus illiteratus, for more vnlearned.
            
            
                And though this bee not all that he might be ſhamed  with in this kinde, yet come we now to the fourth, which is his Tediouſneſſe and his Talkatiuenes, in very truth vnſupportable. Cruditando ortygometram, vſque ad nauſcam. Tertull.

Viguerius (a notable Papiſt) rehearſes them for S. Ambroſes. Vide Tabul. man, after Pope) that preſumed to cut them out, and to corrupt the Copyes; which this good fellow would faine charge now vpon the Biſhop of Ely, for retayning them.

And indeed what maruaile if he corrupt the Fathers, and wring their noſes, till he fetch out blood, as Salomon ſaies (ſuch bloody poſitions as they foſter now in their ſchooles, with the danger of whole ſtates) when he abuſes the Biſhops words ſo before his face, as I euen now declared, cutting Etſi into Et and Si, and to ſhew you how punctuall he is in his recitings, marring and monſtrifying anothers directeſt meaning, with his own moſt prodigious interpunctions. You would ſay he were a Procruſtes, with his bed of tyrannies (worſe then Ogs iron

bed) to crucifie his ſtrangers. But is this all? doth he not corrupt the Fathers alſo moſt groſſely himſelfe? Auguſtine,

Auſten is not ſo, but thus rather, Cuius eccleſiae ille agnoſcitur in figurâ geſtâſſe perſonam: geſtâſſe beeing of leſſe force to ſerue his turne then geſſiſſe by much, and in figura beeing left out, which ſerues to turne all cleane another away.

               manifeſtaret, vnitatis eiuſdem originem, ab vno incipientem, ſuâ auctoritate diſpoſuit. And yet profeſſing to engliſh them, he couches very handſomely into the heart of them, I know not what about the appointing of one chaire, belike for the Pope to ſit downe in, and reſt himſelfe, whom S. Vide Cypr. l. 1. Ep. 3. & Ep. 4. Niſi pancis deſperatis & perditis, minor videtur eſſe authoritas Epiſco porum Africae [quàm Romae.] Item ad Pomp. contra Epiſt. Stephani.

               Cyprian had not the manners to entertain ſo kindly, as his ſundry ſcufflings with him may teſtifie. Is not this to craue leaue, once again, to build a tabernacle more then Chriſt allowes? vnum mihi, one for Peter, &c. As for the Cambron copie, and Pamelius the finder, they are too light of credit, to outface ſo many, ſo auncient, and ſo vncontrollable. Shall the Biſhop be cenſured, for alleadging that which all haue ſaue one, and it ſo iuſtly ſuſpected, as ſauouring of Sixtus Quintus his poiſonous ſallet, and ſhall not this be called forgerie, to cleaue to one ſo abortiue and newfangle, & forſake the reſt?  Neither doubt  I, but if the Biſhop had quoted Auſtens Epiſtle to Pope Coeleſtinus, about fuſtie Antonie, or Antonie of Fuſſula, his depoſing from his Biſhopricke, which in none of the old editions is extant, it would haue bin counted coggery, or what worſe may be in the language of our F. T. and his fellow-Criticks: yet he may vouch it, and aske no pardon. Eudaemon-Iohannes
               
that Reuerend Father, as the Adioynder ſtyles him (mulus mulum, cap. 2.) had the Biſhop in iealouſie, when time was, for counterfeiting an Epiſtle of the firſt Councell of Conſtantinople to the Emperour Theodoſius, which but that hee was ſtarke beetle-blind at broad noone day, he might haue found and groped in more then one edition. And ſhall theſe ware goe for currant now, which neuer ſaw the light till yeſterday, to ſpeake of? But as for Eudoemon (howſoeuer he eſteeme of him,) we will ſay no worſe for this once, then with the holy Apoſtle,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                both avoided. Yet it ſeemes that the Adioynder, pricked on with his example, makes haſt to follow him. Of whome becauſe we are ſpeaking now of his corrupting the Fathers, I ſee not but that alſo may be reckoned among his corruptions, that he defends the Cardinalls adoremus for adornemus, and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Would it not follow by this meanes that angulos for angelos is good reading? As in the Councell of Laodicea, Ne angelos nominemus,

                which they read angulos for many yeeres together, and thought they had the perfect meaning of the Canon; ſo little they feared to be encombred with idolatrie. But to drawe to a concluſion.
            Theſe things thus conſidered, may we not ſay to the Adioynder, rudely replying vpon ſo reuerend a Prelate, as Chryſippus did to one that peſtered Cleanthes (and though vnmannerly enough, yet I thinke not ſo ruſtically as our Adiumbler in many points)

               1. IN what ſenſe S. Auſten ſaies, that Peter repreſented the Churches perſon; Not as Supreame Magiſtrate (which ſauours not of Scripture, neither for words, nor ſenſe, of Tullies Offices rather;) but as a patterne purpoſely pickt out by our Sauiour, to inſtance vnitie in, and to ſpeake to one, what he meant of all, euen ſuch as otherwiſe were cleane out of hearing. This is debated by collation of diuers places out of S. Auſten, from pag. 3. to pag. 31. [Inſomuch as Sylveſter himſelfe, V. Clavis. §. 5. Omnes Sacerdotes habent claves. Nec obſtat quod dictum eſt Petro, Tibi dabo; Nam hoc factum eſt ad oſtendendū VNITATEM ECCLESIAE. Yea Bellarm, acknowledges it to be the expoſition of ſome Diuines of Paris, quòd Dominus oravit pro Petro, vt TOTIVS Eccleſiae figuram gerebat. Meaning thereby, that Christ praied not for his perſon; but for the Church, which he reſembled. Or els Bellarm, neede not reiect this expoſition, (as he doth) if they ſaid onely, that our Sauiour Chriſt praied for Peter as chiefe Magiſtrate. For then it would deſcend fitly

enough vpon the Pope; which is Bellarmines drift there. But he reiecteth it as I ſaid; Therefore gerere perſonam Eccleſiae, is not to be chiefe Magiſtrate, in his or their opinion. De Rom. Pont. l. 4. c. 3. in initio.]
               
               2. How Peter arriued to the glorie of Chriſts ſufferings, and yet ſuffered not for vs, though fondly he once preſumed to ſuffer for Chriſt himſelfe, pro liberatore liberandus, as S. Auſt. ſaies. Againſt the bartring of Satisfactions between one man & an other, an vſuall and againfull trade in Poperie. p. 32. 33. 34.
               3. Peter the fitter to paragon the Church, becauſe a great ſinner, and ſo apt to ſhew mercie. The Church likewiſe, in the diſpenſation of the Keyes. p. 35.
               4. Peters faults expreſſed by S. Auſten, but omitted by the Adioynder, where he complaines of omiſſions. Fiue in all, to the preiudice of their Primacie, not to the proofe of it, as Bellarmine would. p. 35. 36. &c.
               
               5. The peace of the Church ſtands in the gratiouſnes of Princes, and their wiſhing well to Relligion, not in Ieſuiticall reſiſtance and armes. p. 38. 39. &c.
               
               6. The Papiſts pride is the ſame with the Luciferians, in that they will not vnderſtand Petrum in petra, that is, the Church in Chriſt, as S. Auſten conſtrues it. p. 40.
               7. The Luciferians forbid mariages, as the Papiſts doe: but not the Fathers, nor the Councells, though it be after vow, as is moſt probable. p. 41.
               8. The words of S. Ambroſe, which the Adioynder impudently charges the Biſhop to be of his deuiſing, and vtterly beſide the truth of all copies, are manifeſtly ſhewed firſt to be in eleuen printed copies very ancient, then in fowre manuſcripts beyond exception. One of the KINGS MAIESTIES Librarie, a copie very faire written, and withall ſo auncient as before the Conqueſt, giuen by a Monke called Os-Ketel, to the Monaſterie of Rocheſter. Another of Merton Colledge in Oxford. Two out of the Ʋniuerſitie of Cambridge. Laſtly, in an other edition of Paris, that retaines thoſe words, after the late Rome Copie had preſumed to leaue them out, by the partiall direction

of Felice Peretto, afterwards Sixtus Quintus. pag. 44. &c. (Whereunto may be added (becauſe the Adioynder makes this his capitall imputation of vntruths to the Biſhop) that Iohannes Viguerius a Papiſt of chiefe note for learning and iudgement, reads them iuſt as the Biſhop quoteth them.

               29. The not erring of the Church of Rome for a certaine ſeaſon, was no ſecuritie for her perſeuerance in after-times. The titles giuen to her by Iuſtinian, are common to other Churches; and ſome greater then they. p. 91.
               30. Iuſtinians facts of more force to prooue, then Patarenſis his words. And the Adioynders inſtance againſt this, is anſwered. p. 93.

               32. Iuſtinian ſlaundered by the Adioynder of vnlearnedneſſe, without ground. His ſaluation likewiſe queſtioned by him, very vncharitably. p. 95

37. It was more then Pope Leo could doe, to quaſh the Canon of the Councell of Chalcedon, concerning the equalling of Conſtantinople with Rome. The Adioynders foure reaſons to the contrarie are anſwered. p. 105
               38. The Popes cenſures derided by godly Biſhops, and himſelfe cenſured as faſt when there was occaſion. p. 107
               39. Other obiections diſſolued againſt the Canon of Chalcedon, viz. 1. the Emperour Iuſtinus, and Iohn Biſhop of Conſtantinople, their ſeeking for vnion with the See of Rome. 2.

               41. Fowre reaſons brought by the Adioynder, why Pope Leo had good cauſe to except againſt the ſaid Canon, (though it be cleane beſide the Text of the Biſhops booke, which he profeſſeth to refute, and a meere itching after occaſion to be doing) are anſwered in their order. As firſt, that Anatolius his aſpiring humour was not the cauſe of enacting this Canon, as the Adioynder ſtaunders him. Secondly, that the Canon was neither made in the abſence of the Popes Legates, nor yet by conſtraint or ſurreption of the Fathers, but with generall willingneſſe and gratulation of all ſides, ſaue onely the partiall Agents of Pope Leo, &c. p. 112. 113. 114. &c.
               
               42. The ſtyles of poore ſuiters, and the backeſides of letters, not to bee drawne into argument, as the Biſhop anſwered. The Adioynders replyes to the contrarie confuted. p. 116. 117
               43. Titles giuen to Leo by the Councell, are no more then haue been giuen to other Biſhops, and ſome of them to Noble Lay-men. The Biſhops of Alexandria and Conſtantinople are called Biſhops of the Catholique Church. p. 118
               44. Idle diſtinction of the Adioynder, betweene the priuiledges

               45. Leoes excommunicating of Dioſcorus; but by the Synod, per praeſentem ſanctam Synodum, the very words of his Legates in the Councell. Which the Adioynder moſt wretchedly ſticks not to conſtrue, as if the Synode had been Leoes inſtrument in the Excommunication. The Ieſuites would make a generall Councell the Popes inſtrument. Yet at an other time, the Pope was as much inſtrument to the Italian Biſhops, and to the Synode of Rome; for ſo much as they wrote by Iulius Biſhop of Rome, ſaith Ath

               52. The Adioynders groſſe corrupting of S. Cyprians text: (though he crie out euery where againſt the Biſhop for corruptions.) p. 130.

               55. The Biſhops coniecture remaines probable, that the Cardinall left out thoſe words out of Cyprian deceitfully, wherein he ſaies, That it had beene an arrogant and an inſolent part in Peter, to haue anſwered Paul when he rebuked him, by ſaying, That the Primacie was his, and therefore he ought not to be controlled. ibid.
               
               56. The Adioynder neuertheles ſaies, that Peter might haue ſaid ſo in his full right; giuing Cyprian the lie, ſo. ibid.

               58. The Adioynder is content to charge S. Peter with errour, dummodò imperet. Takes away veritie, to giue him primacie, very vnaduiſedly. ibid.
               
               59. The Biſhops denying the ſequele, à fundamento ad caput, is maintained againſt the trifling ſophiſtries of the Adioynder. p. 134.
               60. The teſtimonies out of S. Hierome for Peters primacie, are anſwered: for one word of eminencie, three of equalitie are found in the firſt of them. p. 135.

               62. The Apoſtles though confirmed, might neede ſuch a head;

or though not they, yet the multitudes that might haue reference to them. And to the Adioynder, telling vs that we neede ſuch a head as much as the Apoſtles, we graunt what he ſaies, and we admit no leſſe, or rather farre more, though we acknowledge no Pope. p. 137.

                  Their owne Genebrard in Pſal. 67. r. 37. expounding that prophecie there of the vocation of the Gentiles, and what degree of honour they ſhall hold vnder Chriſt, ſaies plainly, that the holy Ghoſt Aequat Orientales Occidentalsbus, preferres neither before the other. Which is a moſt true word; ſaue onely as inward worth ſhall commend thē to God. 
                  where as they preſume for certaine, that they excell them in piety, and vertuous life. Laſtly, they are ſo hardie, as to threaten Iulius for tranſgreſſing of the Canons, p. 188. & 189.
               99. Damaſus his titles, the Adioynders tattles, frothie ſtuffe to conclude for Monarchie. p. 189. & 190
               100. Damaſus his gouerning the houſe of God: His letters for Peter of Alexandria. ibid.
               101. Damaſus takes in hand, Vitalis an Antiochian heretike, to examine him; but by the permiſſion of Paulinus his own Biſhop. So may any body. Preſcribe, a proud word of the Adioynders weauing in, cleane beſides the truth of the text. Damaſus confeſſeth that Paulinus could doe as much as himſelfe in the matter, but onely to ſhewe conſent between Biſhops, &c. p. 191.
               102. The Adioynders buskin tearmes are opened: Flauianus his pretended reſtoring by Damaſus, was nothing but their mutuall returning to agreement after a priche; the manner being in thoſe times, for two diſſenting Biſhops, to forbeare the communion of one another, till reconciliation and clearing of matters, &c. p. 192
               103. Of Pope Siricius; That the Councell of Capua committing to him the ſmall hearing of acauſe, makes for the Councels authoritie,

rather then for his; the Councel deputing, he being deputed. And yet not with any power to controwle former iudgements, but becauſe (ſaies S. Ambroſe) they preſumed that what Theophilus (Biſhop of Alexandria) ſhould define, the ſame would Siricius (the Pope of Rome) allowe.

               106. 
                     Ʋniuerſall iuriſdiction goes not with ſedes Apoſtolica. Of which kind there are more then the Romane Sea. Paſtorall diligence to preuent the danger of Chriſts weake members, is made power and authoritie ouer ALL the members of Chriſts bodie, as the Adioynder metamorphoſes it, to claw the Pope. p. 195.
               107. Innocentius either a badpen-man, or his Epiſtles counterfeit. Yet Reſcripſit ad omnia prout fas erat &c. is of the matters then in hand, not of the bye: which notwithſtanding are not ſo prowdas the Adioynder would frame them, paring away words to peruert the ſentence: which he imputes to the Biſhop, while he practiſeth himſelfe. p. 196.

               109. The Papiſts fleete from ſenſe to ſenſe, in expounding of Scriptures, and at laſt they ſay, that the literall ſenſe is not ſo plaine as the allegoricall. A fine fancie. p. 199.
               110. Not we, but the Papiſts, confound Clergie and Laitie. The Pope giues leaue to lay-men to diſpenſe ſpirituall matters, and ſome to take the Sacrament out of their own hands. p. 200.

               113. As one, ſo the other, of things ſpoken to Peter, (in Origens iudgement) are to be conſtrued. Paſce oves, like Ae dificabo ſuper hanc, & è contra. Therefore the Biſhop ſatisfies all moſt directly, anſwering one by the other, of the places cōcerning Peter produced out of Origen, notwithſtanding the Adioynders abſurd cauillation. p. 202.

               115. Peter could not merit to be the rocke of the Church, as the Adioynder dreames out of S. Hilarie miſunderſtood. And much leſſe by onely rowing in a boat at ſea, (as out of Maximus) could he atcheiue ſuch preferment, ſo incomparably diſtant. S. Hilarie aſſignes the prerogatiue to his faith, fiue-fold to nothing, aboue his perſon. p. 206. 207. 208. 209.
               116. Maximus his Sermons, of what authoritie. p. 210.

               119. This replie of the Biſhops, is defended againſt the Adioynders wittie follies. p. 213. & 214.
               120. Continuall ſuccſſion of Biſhops, one after another, in the ſame Sea, doth not prooue that none of them euer erred. p. 212.
               121. And much leſſe that Peter was at Rome, becauſe the Succeſſion in the Sea of Rome neuer failed. ibid.
               122. Maximus his elogia of Paul and Peter ſo tempered, as he

rather enclines to yeild Paul the preheminence. p. 214. & 215
               123. The old Papiſts were not ſo violent in their concluſions againſt Princes, as the moderne Ieſuits. p. 217. (Ieſuini in eo ſapientes, quòd put ant ſe coelo ipſi quando

Auſten ſaies, the commiſſion giuen to Peter, Feede my ſheepe, was giuen to all (ad omnes dicitur,) it was becauſe S. Peter bare the perſon of the Church, which with him imports as much, as to be indued with Supreame authoritie ouer the Church. And to this end Tullies Offices are quoted very freſhly, Eſt proprium munus magiſtratûs, &c. It is the proper office or dutie of a Magiſtrate, to vnderſtand, that he beareth the perſon of the citie. And ſo, ſaies he, Peter looſes no authoritie by this authoritie, but gaines rather.
               § 3. Where firſt when S. Auſten ſaies, that Peter bare the perſon of the Church, and by that expounds his ad omnes dicitur, as this man fancyeth; I ſhould thinke vnder correction, that he meanes the Church onely repreſentatiue, conſiſting of the Apoſtles and Paſtors,  and no more;  for they onely feede: which will hardly amount to ſo great a ſumme, as the Papiſts would make S. Peter chiefe Magiſtrate of: viz. to beare authoritie ouer the whole Church militant, and euery member thereof. Yea, and in ſome caſes of extention, not onely ouer them which are without holy orders, and ſo no Feeders, but ouer them alſo which are cleane fallen away from the Church: and which is yet more, ouer them which neuer ſet foote within it. For thither alſo reacheth their ierke, as they call it, of indirect power. 
                   And though this ſhould be granted in S. Auſtens ſenſe,  that S. Peter bare the perſon of all the members of the

Church, (as no queſtion but he figured the communitie in many things, as may be afterward not onely yeilded to, but declared at large,) yet who would euer beleeue, that whē the 
                     Feeders of thē
                        ſelues, is put in the euill ſenſe, by S. Iude v. 12. taking many things from S. Peter himſelfe. 2. Pet. 2. precept is of Feeding the flock of Chriſt, this precept is giuen to the flocke it ſelfe? which neuertheleſſe muſt needes be I ſay, if it be giuen to S. Peter, bearing the perſon of the flocke; as he muſt needs beare that, if he beare the perſon of the whole Church, euen in that, that he was bid to feede the flocke. Doe you ſee then what a confuſion you haue brought vs in already? how you haue pulled down the partition wall betweene the Laitie and the Clergie, ſo as now Theodor. hiſt. 5. 1
                        •
                     . 
                  Theodoſius may ſit him downe where he will, though it be at Millan it ſelfe, without any ſcrupuloſitie? how you haue vtterly remooued the incloſures about the mountaine, and made way for M. Saunders his Lib. de claue David. 
                  Aclerus, as he calls him, while you would ſeeme to ſet vp a Nauclerus in Chriſts Church, and to be the onely true friend to the beautie of Gods houſe? Yet you are wont to Adioynd. c. 2. n. 19 & ſequen. Item c. 5. n. 6. ſay, that this is our fault, to take away diſtinction betweene the ſheepe and the ſhepheard, betweene the people and the Paſtors, and to lay all open to the wild boare out of the wood. Nay, not onely you confound the Laitie and the Clergie, but you make as many Popes by this meanes as  there be Chriſtians.  For placing the Popedome in Paſce oves meas, in feeding Chriſts ſheepe, you graunt that this commiſſion was giuen to Peter repreſenting their perſons, &c. Which is as much to ſay, as, they are all made Feeders of the whole flocke, by vertue of theſe words, no leſſe then he.
               § 4. As for that you expound the bearing of the perſon by Tullies Offices, to be no other then to be made Supreame Magiſtrate, though it be firſt vncouth to expound Auſten by Tullie, whoſe phraſe for the moſt part is not ſo ſutable; yet let S. Auſten deliuer his owne

minde for this point, lib. de paſtor. (for wee ſpeake of paſce, and hee handles this argument in the very place that I quote) cap. 12. Quemadmodum loquantur authores mundi, quid ad nos? As much to ſay, as, What care wee how Tully ſpeakes? Beſides, that if S. Auſten had meant to decipher Peter by thoſe words to be cheife magiſtrate of the Church vnder Chriſt, (for ſo you conceiue) perhaps he would rather haue ſaid that he bore Chriſti perſonam, then Eccleſiae; the perſon of Chriſt, then of the Church. As the deputy Regent of a kingdome or territorie vnder an abſolute Prince, may rather be ſaid to beare the Princes perſon, then the Common-wealthes that he gouernes in his right. So here. And ſo ſpeakes your Andradius, lib. 1. de Concil. Papa Christi perſonam gerit, the Pope beares the perſon of Chriſt: ſo diuerſe more of the ſame ſtraine. Neither laſtly, does it ſeeme likely in reaſon, that a Prince ſhould repreſent for his Common-wealth, the head for the bodie, which are rather diſtinguiſhed ſtill one againſt the other, as membra diuidentia, and two parties; but either certaine of the Commons for the whole multitude; or as in other caſes, ſome one man for the King. But compare wee more narrowly S. Auſten with Tully, ſince you will needs vrge vs to it.
               § 5. In Tully it is gerere, in S. Auſten geſtare perſonam Eccleſiae. Is there no difference thinke you betweene theſe two? What if one be of things figuratiue, another of things eſſentiall? wil you blame me as too criticall for diſtinguiſhing betweene gerere and geſtare? Gerimus magiſtratum, geſtamus veſtem, either ſcenicam, or ſome other. Geſtamus & perſonam; I meane not nowe perſonam in S. Auſtens ſenſe, leaſt S. Peter be farther off from his ſupremacie then you are aware. And though Auſten in ſome place may ſay, gerere perſonam, euen of Peter in this caſe, yet neither in that place that you now

alleadge, de Agone Chriſtiano, cap. 30. and for one gerebat, you ſhal haue 5. geſtabats in S. Auſten, I beleeue. Geſtare, portare, ſuſtinere, ſigurare, all theſe I may remember; gerere, though I denie not, yet it comes ſo ſieldom, as I may truely ſay, I ſcarce remember.
               § 6. Touching what you inſert here, That whatſoeuer is giuen to the King as King, the ſame is giuen to the Common-wealth, whereof he beareth and repreſenteth the perſon: and ſo in like manner, what was giuen to S. Peter as head of the Church, the ſame belongs to the Church her ſelfe: I will not follow you too cloſe about your State-poſitions, ſo fauourable to Kings as we knowe of old, ſo inlarging their ſway as you now profeſſe, that what power the one hath, the other hath the like, King and people, (though 1. Sam. 8. 11. we read of iudicium Regis erga populū, but none populi erga Regem, the King might iudge the people, but not the people the King) & therefore this ſecret might haue rotted in your breaſt; to omit this I ſay, It will follow out of your doctrine, that what our Sauiour may doe as Head of his Church, the ſame may his Church doe of her owne head. The inſtances are diuerſe, in your practiſe ſpecially, I need not faine. As to mangle the communion, to diſmiſſe ſubiects from their allegiance, to reſtraine marriages, to diſpenſe with vowes, with oathes, &c. In all which you ſet your wit againſt his, your authoritie againſt his, and namely in the queſtion of aſſoyling from Obedience, how often doe we heare from you in plaine Thom. Aquin. 2. 2. q. 12. art. 2. Valentian, in illum locum, & alij. tearmes, that Eccleſia habet authoritatem Dei in terris? No doubt, becauſe whatſoeuer is giuen to the head, the ſame is giuen to the bodie, as here you tell vs. Though againe you are as rude with your owne Doctors, as before you were raſh with Princes Crownes, when you ſay in your application, that in like ſort whatſoeuer is giuen to Saint Peter as Head of the Church, the ſame is giuen

to the Church her ſelfe: which you would neuer haue ſaid, I ſuppoſe, but to defend your grammar-paradoxe about gerere perſonam, with a farre more deſperate paradoxe in diuinitie. Diſcerne you no better betweene Popes and Councels, which are the Church in effect? or ſhall theſe play quarter-maſters with the Pope? Doe you ſo vnderſtand the Councell of Baſile, or the Councell of Conſtance, which your fellowes would helpe you to conſtrue more mildly; or will you reuiue that charme of our King Henrie the 4. of famous memorie, who writing to the Pope to perſwade Stow annal. Angl. ann. 10. Hen. 4. p. 546. him to conformitie, alleadged thus (if Stow ſay true:) Si non audierit Eccleſiam, &c. If he heare not the church, that is, obey not, let him be vnto thee as an heathen & a Publican? As for S. Cyprians authoritie, which you botch into your text here, impertinēt enough, that Eccleſia eſt in Epiſcopo, the Church is in the Biſhop, becauſe the Biſhop, as you ſay, is Head of the Church; do you not conſider why that was ſpoken by S. Cyprian, euen to curbe the inſolencie of your Romiſh Hierarche, and to ſhew that Biſhops are rather abſolute in themſelues, (he of Carthage at leaſt, Romes ancient peu-fellow) Eccleſia Carthag.

Rationem actûs ſui Chriſto reddituri, as the ſame Father ſayes elſewhere, to giue account of their doings to Chriſt [onely.] But I come to S. Auſten. In whoſe words I affirme, that gerere perſonam, is to reſemble the Church, or to ſtand for the Church; not to bee made the cheife magiſtrate of the Church, as you would face vs. And that our Sauiour directing his charge to them all, inſtanced the willinger, as I may ſay, in one, which was S. Peter, and ſpake to him for all, to commend the loue of vnitie to them. Imò verò & in ipſo Petro vnitatem commendauit: yea, and in Peter himſelfe hee commended [this] vnitie: Multi erant Apoſtoli, & vni dicitur,

Paſceoues meas: There were many Apoſtles, and it is ſaid [but] to one, Feede my ſheepe: Why that, but onely to commend vnitie to them? In hoc cognoſcent 
                  Ioh. 13. 35. 
                  omnes vos eſſe meos: By this ſhall all men know you to be my diſciples, if you loue one another. And, Looke you fall not out by the way: Ioſephs precept that he gaue to Gen. 45. 24. his brethren. This was the care that our Sauiour had of vnitie. Againe, S. Auſten in the ſame chapter, cap. 13. de paſtorib. (that you may beleeue that booke the rather in the explication of paſce,) Nam & ipſum Petrum 
                  Quaſi alter alteri. 
                  cui commendauit oues ſuas, quaſi alter alteri, vnum ſecum facere volebat. He ſought not to make him a diuerſe regent, as you imagine, a deputie in his abſence, but in all his ſpeech, he droue after vnitie, that intending the vnitie of the Church with himſelfe, euen as he and his father are all one, (as he ſaies,) which ſhal not be perfected Ioh. 17. 22. till after this life, yet in the meane time one man might ſtand for his Church, and repreſent his Church, the better to knit vp this knot betweene them. 
                     Ʋt ſic ei oues commendaret, ſaies S. Auſten, vt eſſet ille caput, ille figuram corporis portaret, id eſt, Eccleſiae, & tanquam ſponſus & ſponſa eſſent duo in carne vnâ: that is, That ſo he might commend his ſheepe vnto him, that himſelfe might bee the head, the other might beare the figure of his bodie, that is the Church, and as bride and bridegroome they might be twaine in one fleſh. Here, I trow, you haue Peter, not the head, but the bodie, plainely ſo diſtinguiſhed by S. Auſten, vt eſſet ille caput, that Chriſt might be the head; Peter, ſhall I ſay, the body? nay, not ſo much as the bodie, but figuram corporis portaret, ſaies S. Auſten, that hee might carry the figure or reſemblance of the bodie. And is gerere perſonam now, and geſtare figuram all one, thinke you, becauſe of Tullies Offices? Yet you cry out againſt the Biſhop for fraudulent dealing, and ſuperſcribe your boxe, A Diſcouerie of his abſurdities, falſities,

lyes: you blame him for lame quotation of places. Indeed he is as compendious in quoting the Fathers, as you are ambitious in citing your owne Supplement, and as talkatiue and full of circumſtance as any pies-neſt.

               But for quoting of places againſt the light of conſcience, was there euer any wretch ſo taken 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , ſo in the very manner, as you are in the conſtruction of gerere perſonam, which S. Auſten expounds by geſtare figuram, or portare figuram, you would faine extend to boundleſſe iuriſdiction? And if gerere and geſtare were graunted you to be all one, is there no difference betweene figure and perſona, as perſona is put for maieſtas reip.? will you put figura in that ſenſe too? You imagine the Church to carrie S. Peter; no doubt, as a beaſt carryeth the rider: and ſome of you haue allegorized it ſo, from Balaam and his aſſe, to the Pope and your Church. Here you ſee the Church doth not beare S. Peter, but S. Peter beares the figure of the bodie, that is, of the Church. And where you thinke the Supremacie that you attribute to your Pope was grounded vpon the infallibilitie of his iudgement in faith, and from thence proceeded that ſame Paſce oues meas, S. Auſten tels you farther, to correct that opinion, that the ground of his commiſſion was the ſtrength of his loue, in theſe words, Proinde vt oues commendaret, quid illi priùs dicit, ne illi tanquam alteri commendaret? 
                  Ne illi tanquam alteri. 
                  Petre amas me? Et reſpondet; Amo, &c. Confirmat trinitatem, vt conſolidet vnitatem: that is, Therefore that hee might commend his ſheepe vnto him, what firſt does hee ſay vnto him, that he might not commend them to him as to another man? Peter loueſt thou me? And he anſwereth, I loue thee, &c. He confirmes trinitie, to eſtabliſh vnitie. So as euery where, vnitie and loue is aimed at, which is the bond that couples Chriſt and his Church; which Church as I tell you, Peter repreſenteth here, no otherwiſe then a proxie doth him that he ſtands to be admitted for. But you

doating vpon the priuiledges of your earthly God, blot out loue to bring in power, and for that which S. Auſten ſaid a little before, vt eſſent duo in carne vnâ, your Canoniſts haue not ſhamed to turne it thus; vt eſſent duo in ſede vnâ: as if Chriſt and the Pope had one Conſiſtoire. This is the agreement between you and S. Auſten here.
               § 7. You againe cite S. Auſten in his commentarie vpon the 108. Pſalme. Were you diſpoſed, trow you, to doe your ſelfe a ſhrewd turne? For from whence could you receiue a greater blow? Yet here againe I muſt tell you, that your citation is wrong. Cuius eccleſiae (ſay you, as quoting S. Auſten) ille agnoſcitur geſſiſſe perſonam, meaning of Peter. But S. Auſten ſayes not ſo. Firſt, not geſſiſſe but geſtaſſe, is S. Auſtens. See you now that I diſtinguiſhed theſe two, not without cauſe before? For neither did you, I am ſure, without cauſe here change them. You know that gerere is of farre more force, then geſtare in theſe matters: ſo as gerere remp. is as much as regere remp., geſtare not. And if S. Auſten had ſaid geſſiſſe perſonam; yet ſee, I pray you, with what qualification. Not ſimply geſſiſſe, but in figurâ geſſiſſe perſonam eccleſiae: which you cut out: as if in figurâ were no words, or words of no ſenſe, or ſenſe, but not to your tooth. This is your honeſt dealing, that cry out againſt falſhood. Call you this arguing in figurâ againſt your betters? And would you read that to the Corinthians, or ſuffer to bee read, (ſuppoſe in your Colledge hall at Rome, where as we in our Colledges here read the Bible at our ordinary meales, ſo Father Parſons made the ſchollers to reade the booke of Titles, and of claimes to Kingdomes, if your Seculars haue ſaid true, and men ſay that you boaſt of Father Parſons his ſpirit;) would you ſuffer I ſay to be read, Omnia contingebant illis, and no more, for omnia in figurâ 
                  1. Cor. 10. 
                  contingebant illis? ſpecially if the controuerſie were how omnia contingebant illis, as here the controuerſie was about gerere perſonam, and in what ſenſe. But let vs heare S. Auſten: Sicut quaedam dicuntur quae ad Apoſtolum Petrum

propriè pertinere videantur, nec tamen habent illuſtrem intellectum, niſi cùm referuntur ad eccleſiam, cuius ille agnoſcitur in ſigurâ geſtâſſe perſonam, propter primatum quem in diſcipulis habuit, ſicut eſt, Tibi dabo claues regni coelorum, & ſiqua huiuſmodi: ita Iudas perſonam quodam modo ſuſtinet inimicorum Chriſti Iudaeorum; qui & tunc oderant Chriſtum, &c. As ſome things are ſaid which may ſeeme properly to belong to the Apoſtle Peter, and yet make no cleare ſenſe, but when they are referred to the Church, whereof he is knowne to haue repreſented the perſon figuratiuely, for the cheifedome which he had among the diſciples, as that is for one, To thee I will giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and if there bee any like: ſo Iudas ſuſtaines after a manner the perſon of the Iewes Chriſts enemies, who both then hated Chriſt, &c. Here is ſomewhat that you catch at, but more that we may retort vpon you. You catch verie greedily at propter primatum quem in diſcipulis habuit, which we neuer doubt but S. Peter had, a place of ſome priority in the quire Apoſtolike. And it may be for that, our Sauiour the rather choſe him, to repreſent his Church. More zealous then the reſt, more auncient then the reſt; whether to figure the faith, or the eternity of the Church, the one in this world, the other in the next, or for what endowment elſe of his you can deuiſe. For ſome no doubt. And if it be ſecret, is it therefore none? will you call Chriſt to account for euerie thing? and vnleſſe wee can anſwer for him, will you condemne him? Why not ſome other as well as Peter, ſay you, if it were onely a matter of repreſentation? As if I might not ſay the like, Why not ſome other as well as Peter preferred to be the cheife magiſtrate? It was free, you will ſay, to our Sauiours choice, and but one could be to ſway a monarchie: he choſe Peter. And may not I ſay the ſame? But one could be to figure vnitie: for, for that cauſe hee choſe one: and as in diuerſe other things Peter had the preheminence, but yet with others, as Iames and Iohn, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and Gal. 2. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , (more primi then Peter, where more might be vſed)

ſo here where but one could be employed in the buſineſſe, the reſt beeing ſlipt ouer, Peter was thought the meeteſt to be the modell of vnitie, becauſe in ſome prerogatiue hee might paſſe thoſe primos; or perhaps it was the ſecret of our Sauiours breſt. Are you ſo little acquainted with the libertie of Gods actions? or reſerue you nothing for our knowledge in the world to come? This to your obiection.
               § 8. Now marke what we gather out of S. Auſtens text. Firſt, Some things there are ſeeming to belong to Peter, which can make no cleare ſenſe, but when they are conſtrued of the Church. This is flat againſt you, that would haue Peter ſuch a figure of the Church forſooth, as yet to occupy a certain place of his owne, and what is giuen to Peter ſhould be giuen to the Church, and what to the Church, the ſame to Peter. But ſome things, ſaies S. Auſten, are ſaid to Peter which can haue no pregnant conſtruction but of the Church.
               
               Secondly, amidſt thoſe ſome things, is, Tibi dabo claues. S. Auſten vſeth this very example; which you would fain haue to be ingroſſed by Peter, as if the keyes had perſonally beene deliuered to him, and in his owne right: which S. Auſten denies.
               Thirdly, Si qua alia, if there be any more. There may bee more then, as, Paſce oues. No doubt this muſt be one; by his owne expoſition before, de Agone Chriſtiano, c. 30.
               Fourthly, that he bare indeed perſonam eccleſiae, but in figurâ, which you had pared off. Not by power of his place, or authoritie permanent; but culld out before the reſt by our Lord for that end, to ſignifie vnitie.
               Fiftly, that primatus was not the primacie of magiſtracy, euen that declares; that he ſaies, the keyes were promiſed to him propter primatum. So that firſt the primacie, then the keyes. And his primacie among the Apoſtles was a motiue-cauſe to promiſe him the keies in the name of the Church: whereas elſe primatus and the keies had gone together, and as ſoone as primatus, ſo ſoone the keies. But

now they are promiſed him for ſome ſpecialty in him. Not for office then, as you would haue it.
               Sixtly, as Iudas ſuſtained the perſon of the wicked, (ſuſtinuit, a more powerfull word then geſtauit, and much more then ſignificauit, which is ſaid here of Peter, and yet but quodam modo, ſo ſhie is S. Auſten, ſo farre from the iuriſdiction that you build vpon Tullies Offices) ſo Peter of the Church. As Iudas of the one, ſo Peter of the other, ſaith S. Auſten: which is no authoritatiue primacie, you may bee ſure, vnleſſe Iudas ſhall haue a generation of Succeſſors now, as well as Peter, and (which is more damnable) of holy Scriptures inſtitution. If any ſuch were, who more likely then the Pope, that holds by the purſe which Iudas carried, and troubles all the world for Supremacy in Temporalls? But neither Iudas then, nor the Pope now. Elſe Peter ſhould haue been head, vnder Iudas, his head, (doe you like this?) when he went ſo farre as to ſcandalize our Sauiour, and deſerued the name of Sathan at his hands. Was Peter then vnder Iudas his iuriſdiction? yet, no doubt far gone in that part, which Iudas bare the perſon of, by S. Auſtens ſaying. For ſo we read in his Alia expoſitio of the ſame Pſalme: Cuius populi diximus Iudam in figurâ geſſiſſe perſonam, ſicut eccleſiae geſſit Apoſtolus Petrus. Your grauitie perhaps will ſay, that this is reproach: for ſo chap. 4. num. 33. But we doe but argue, and I pray who giues the cauſe? Quacunque ſcripta ſunt, propter nos ſcripta ſunt. Rom. 15.
               § 9. To omit that Proſper vpon the ſame Pſalme (Proſper Leo's ſecretarie, and S. Auſtens ſcholler) tunes it yet in a higher key, making Iudas not onely beare the perſon of the wicked, which you conſtrue ſo imperiouſly as we haue now heard; but he ſaies in plaine tearmes, Iudas primatum geſſit inimicorum Chriſti, Iudas bare the primacie of Chriſts enemies: which I truſt you will not expound, how impudent ſoeuer, that Iudas was made chiefe magiſtrate ouer Chriſts enemies: no more then was Peter ouer Chriſts friends.
               
                  
§ 10. YOV quote farther S. Auſten in his 13. ſerm. de verbis Domini ſecundum Matth. out of which you haue theſe words, Petrus à Petrâ cognominatus, &c. which moreouer you thus engliſh: Peter taking his name from a rocke, was happy, bearing the figure of the Church, hauing the principalitie of the Apoſtleſhip. Of which anon as it ſerues your turne. In the meane time you may ſee what varietie of words S. Auſten hath, to ſet out the meaning of his gerere perſonam, both here and elſewhere.

may prooue the triple crowne. And had S. Auſton beene ſo fauourable, you had done it ere this. In whome it followes, Saepe reſpondet pro omnibus, ſpoken of Peter. And will you knowe, quo myſterio? Let himſelfe ſhew. 
                     Ʋnus pro multis, vnus in multis: once againe to endeare this vnitie to them. Proceed yet: Simon anteà vocabatur: women autem Petrus à Domino ei impoſitum eſt, & hoc, vt eâ figurâ ſignificaret eccleſiam. Doe you heare figura? doe you heare ſignificaret? How will this agree with gerere perſonam in your maieſticall ſenſe? Yea the name of Peter hee ſayes, was giuen him to that ende, rather to ſignifie for the Church, holding the wholeſome confeſſion, Tues filius Dei viui, then for his owne preheminence of place ouer others. And yet more pregnantly, Quia enim Chriſtus petrā, Petrus populus Chriſtianus. Are you aware what the people haue gotten by this ſhift, whome you are wont to cut ſhort? So many people, ſo many Peters. Vnleſſe you are content that Peter do no more then repreſent the Church, that is, the people of God, as S. Auſtens meaning is.
               § 11. I might tell you of that between, becauſe I would giue you good meaſure for complaining of lamo quotations. Petrus à petrâ, non petra à Petro, and that, as à Chriſto Chriſtianus vocatur, non Chriſtus à Chriſtiano. Yet you would not refuſe to bee called of Peter: and Bellarmine ſaies, Chryſoſtome 
                  De notis eccl. lib. 4. c. 4. prophecyed almoſt as much, Hom. 33. in Act. that you might not be aſhamed if in time to come you were called of the Popes, among whom was Peter. Where you may do well to thinke how this agrees with Nazianzen,

But we are now in S. Auſten, More plainly then againſt them that would be built vpon Peter, which (as I ſaid) you bluſh not, but boaſt of at this day as your ſecondary foundation, See Adioynd. num. 18. c. 3.
                  
                  Homines volenter adificari ſuper homines, men that haue a longing to be built vpon men, (wee vpon their doctrine, Apoc. 21. 14. and Epheſ. 2. 20. you hardly vpon his perſon, or as ſhall ſeeme good) [What ſay they?] Ego ſum Cephae, ipſe eſt Petrus. Quomodo enim non in Pauli, ſic nec in Petri, &c. Vt Petrus ſuper petram, non petra ſuper Petrum: 1. I am Cephas his, now Cephas and Peter are all one. For as wee are not [baptiſed in the name of Paul, ſo are we not of Peter neither, &c. that Peter may [be knowne to be built] vpon the rocke, and not the rocke vpon Peter. But cloſe to our purpoſe. Illum videre Petrum, qui tunc erat figura noſtra: that is, Conſider that Peter who was then our figure; not bare our perſon, that is, bare rule ouer vs, we neuer liuing in Peters time, and his regencie being expired before we were born, but (as I haue often ſaid) ſtanding for the Church by way of type or figure, and ſo he repreſented for vs, and for the Church to the worlds ende, whereas hee could gouerne no more then liued in his owne dayes. Petrus TVNC erat ſigura noſtra. Againe, to vrge ſignificat againſt this mans magnificat, which he ſings to S. Peter, but afore hee know well what it meanes, In eo quòd dixit Petrus, Tues filius Dei viui, firmos ſignificat, ſaies S. Auſten, in eo quòd trepidat, &c. infirmos eccleſiae ſignificat. Is this alſo to be conſtrued by Tullies Offices, of gouernment? or doth S. Auſten not ſpeake yet ſignificantly enough, without we turne the Ieſuites dictionarie? Doth a magiſtrate ſignifie the citie that hee gouernes? or was S. Peter at one time the gouernour of the ſtrong, namely, when he confeſſed and beleeued Chriſt, an other time of the weake, namely, when he ſtaggered? How then was he euer an vniuerſall gouernour? For when hee doubted, he confeſſed not; when he confeſſed, he doubted not. So neuer was he gouernour of the bodie altogether, neuer did he gerere perſonam in that ſenſe. I thinke you ſee cauſe to repent your conſtruction, vnleſſe you be wearie of vniuerſall dominion. And yet once againe S. Auſten, to giue you more light. In illo ergò vno figurabatur eccleſia, &

In him therefore alone, or in that one man therefore, the Church was figured, and each kind of men was to be ſignified, that is both the ſtrong and the weake, becauſe without both of theſe, the Church is not. Doe you perceiue how this fits with that which went before? For either S. Peter was a ruler but by halfes, or gerere perſonam muſt be otherwiſe conſtrued, euen as S. Auſten does here, by figurare, and ſignificare, not as you by regere, a word not once vſed by S. Auſten in all this matter, nor any like it. For, as for primus & praecipuus in ordine Apoſtolorum, we haue cleared it before, and it is too weake a foundation to beare ſuch ſtreſſe. Saue that as Peter of the Church, ſo theſe words of Peter, a ſemblable ſupportance and worthy your chooſing.
               § 12. We are long vpon this place, but the reaſon is, diſcouer one of our Diſcouerers tricks, and diſcredit all. Ambulauit Petrus ſuper aquas iuſſu Domeni. Hi ſunt firmi eccleſiae: Peter walked vpon the waters at our Lords commandement. Theſe are the ſtrong in the Church, ſaies S. Auſten. It puts me in mind of your argument for the primacie. Aquae multae, populi multi: Peters walking on the ſea, was his regiment of the world: yet not all waters, I hope, were in the ſea of Tiberias. Or ſhall we ſay, that this prefigured your Tyber? though ſo doubtfull is as yet Peters reſiance at Rome, that he hath not beene ſeene ſitting, and much leſſe walking there, vpon your Sea. Oneſiphorus with much ſeeking found Paul at Rome, 2. Tim. 1. 17. we Peter not yet. Our Lord indeed entred Peters ſhippe. But what then? I ſhould thinke if Peter had entred his, it had been more pregnant. So might Peter haue been thought to haue ſucceeded in his charge; this allegorie makes Chriſt ſucceed into Peters. No doubt Peter had a boat, as a fiſherman ſhould haue; our Sauiour none, ſanctifying another trade, as we are taught by Iuſtine Martyr, during the time of his minoritie, vntill it pleaſed him to reueale himſelfe

vnto the world. But Bernard ſayes it; wil you be iudged by Bernard? Doe but tell the Pope, as he did Eugenius, he will ſay you ſpeake inconſiderately to him. I wiſſe an eaſie matter for S. Bernards wit, with a flouriſh or ſo, to eſtabliſh the Popedome already eſtabliſhed. Beſides that, he will tell you, S. Iames raiſed ſeede to his brother deceaſed, De conſid l. 2 that is, ſucceeded into our Lords prouince. Vnleſſe our Lord himſelfe had not the world for his ſcope. And Euſebius as much, quoting Clemens for his author, l. 6. Hypotyp. that the cheife Apoſtles themſelues, whereof Peter Lib. 2. hiſt. cap. 1.

               § 13. There are yet two more places behind in S. Auſten. One, Tract. in Iohannem 124. an other de Agone Chriſtiano cap. 30. With that we began, and with the ſame wee will conclude. But the firſt we will fetch from his Tractat. in Ioh. 123. ſomewhat higher. Speaking there of our Sauiours repaſt after his reſurrection with fiſh & hony-combe, he ponders the very number of the diſciples then preſent, and thus gathers: Vt omnes qui hanc ſpem gerimus, per illum ſeptenarium numerum diſcipulorum, per quem poteſt hoc loco noſtra vniuerſitas intelligi figurata, tanto ſacramento nos communicare noſſemus, & eidem beatitudini ſociari. That is, That all we which are indued with this hope, may know that by that ſeuenfold number of diſciples (by which our whole companie may here ſeeme to be figured) we are both partakers of that myſterie, and fellowes in that bliſſe. Neither doubteth he but S. Iohn ending his Goſpel with this narration, hauing many things elſe to report of Chriſt: he ends it, magnâ & magnarum rerum contemplatione, as he ſaies: making it as important, ſo myſticall, you ſee, by that word of contēplation. Where firſt we haue figurari in the ſenſe before confirmed, not theirs, but ours. As erewhile Peter figured the Church, ſo now thoſe ſeuen diſciples figured the vniuerſalitie of Gods people, that is, the Church. And yet I hope they are not made thereby regents of the Church,

though the Ieſuites haue a proiect, wee heare, to bring in more then one, to manage at one time the Sea Apoſtolick. I remember Occham in his Dialogues hath a queſtion to that purpoſe, whether the Popedome may bee ſwayed by many at once? And inclining to thinke it lawfull, it may be the Ieſuites drew it from him, and would put it in practiſe. In truth our Sauiour chooſing 12. Apoſtles, ſhewed he neuer meant, that one ſhould gouern all after they were dead, as theſe now would haue the Pope to doe in Peters ſtead. But as I was ſaying, the 7. figurers here are not 7. gouernours: no more then is Peter figuring the Church, or bearing the figure of the Church, or whatſoeuer elſe ſoundeth that way, inueſted in the authoritie that this man here dreames of, as if gerere figuram, were gerere perſonam; and gerere perſonam, were potiri rerum.
               
               § 14. HEre alſo that is anſwered that F. T. in his wiſdome asked a little before, why onely Peter ſhould beare the perſon of the Church? or, whether none was meete for that part but he? Wee haue anſwered it before; and the like might be asked of Iudas, was there none wicked in thoſe dayes but he? not Herod? not the Phariſies? not any other? or could none but an Apoſtle ſtand for the patterne of bale and condemnation? But S. Auſten here anſwers it a great deale more roundly; that ſeuen men at another time, and not onely Peter, figurauerunt vniuerſitatem noſtram, repreſented our whole companie, the company of the faithfull, that is, the Church of God, whom yet, I ſuppoſe, he will not allow for Popes.
               § 15. Againe in the ſame tractat, that you may ſee how farre Paſce oues meas ſurmounts the Pope, or the Popes commiſſion, which they ſqueeze to the vttermoſt to giue him aduancement, S. Auſten inſiſts firſt vpon that conſideration, oues meas, not, oues tuas, which is worth the poizing, not onely in the ſenſe that the Ieſuits vrge it, as if all Chriſts ſheepe were thereby recommended to Peters charge, Apoſtles,

Prophets, Kings and Emperours: whereas our Sauiour neuertheles hath ſheepe in heauen, &

               § 16. Neither doubts he to extend the force of that paſce which was giuen to Peter, to the cenſure not of Popes onely, though of them too, but of all bad miniſters through out the world. Contra hos vigilat toties inculcata iſta vox Chriſti (Paſce oues meas) quos Apoſtolus gemit ſua quaerere, non quae Ieſu Chriſti. Againſt thoſe ſtands vp this ſaying of Chriſt, ſo often repeated, [Feede my ſheepe,] whome the Apoſtle laments for ſeeking their owne, not the things that are Ieſus Chriſts: [whoſoeuer they are, or of what ranke ſoeuer.] And a little before that, Qui hoc animo paſcunt oues Chriſti, vt ſuas eſſe velint non Chriſti, ſe convincuntur amare non Chriſtum, vel gloriandi, vel dominandi, vel acquirendi cupiditate, non obediends, & ſubueniendi, & deo placendi cupiditate. Which becauſe our Adioynder vnderſtands Latin ſo well, we will leaue to him for this once to Engliſh.
               § 17. Come we now to the 124 Tractat, out of which he vrgeth this: Hoc agit eccleſia ſpe beata, in hac vitâ aerumnoſa, cuius Eccleſiae. Petrus, propter Apoſtolatûs ſui primatum, gerebat figuratâ generalitate perſonam. Which the eaſier to cleare, we may ſort out by parcels that which makes for them. Firſt gerebat perſonam, which this man thinks to be as much as tenebat regimen; but of that before. To omit how it is qualified with figuratâ generalitate, his bearing the perſon,

beeing but figuring, and ſignifying, and repreſenting ſtill, with S. Auſten, which is ſhort of Magiſtracie. Secondly, propter Apoſtolatús ſui primatum. Which the better to conceiue, heare we further S. Auſten, heare you too good Sir, that accuſe the Biſhop for laming places, as if no bodie were ſuch a legall reciter of them as your ſelfe. Quod enim adipſum propriè pertinet, (ſpeaking of Peter) naturâ onus homo erat, gratiâ vnus Chriſtianus, abundantiore gratiâ vnus idem
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      primus Apoſtolus. Sed &c. that is, For as concerning himſelfe, Peter was by nature [but] one man, by grace one Chriſtian man, by a greater meaſure of the ſame grace, one and a prime Apoſtle. But &c. You will ſay perhaps that this is a third kind of aduantage, an authoritie more then euer you were aware of, for Peter, vnus idem
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      primus Apoſtolus. But there is more in it then ſo. S. Auſten knowes but three ſteps of condition here in Peter. A man, which he was by nature, a Chriſtian, which by grace, but by height of grace, by exceſſe of grace, an Apoſtle. Yet vnus Apoſtolus, but one Apoſtle, not virtually as you would haue it, the whole quire or Colledge of them. Our Sauiour was not ſo poore as to haue but one Apoſtle, ſaies Irenaeus, l. 3. againſt them that thought Paul was the onely man. So farre off was Peter then, that ſcarce he was thought to be one of the number. Indeede twelue, as I ſhewed you before, for great cauſe. But concerning Peter, vnus Apoſtolus, ſaies S. Auſten, but one Apoſtle. As for the prime, we graunt you, as you haue beene often told, and to content you the more, more then in one regard of primacie. An excellent flower he was in that garland; what would you els? But that this primacie was diſtinct from your ſuppoſed magiſtracie or maieſtie Eccleſiaſticall, as you would inferre out of gerere perſonam, heare what followes. S. Auſten hauing recounted the three former degrees of Peters condition, he proceedes to a fourth, neither coincident with the reſt, nor yet containing any ſuch principalitie as you talke of, but meerely affoarded him of our Sauiours free bountie, in regard to his

excellent worth among his fellowes. Sed quando ei dictum eſt, Tibi dabo claues regni coelorum, &, Quodcun

                      ſolues ſuper terram, erit ſolutum & in coelis, vniuerſam ſignificabat eccleſiam, ſaies S. Auſten: he ſtood for the Church, it was ſaid to him in the perſon of the Church, not as chiefe Magiſtrate, not as primus Apoſtolus, the firſt wheele in the clocke, but in a ſenſe diſtinct from the former three degrees (therefore he ſaies, Sed quando) yet happily the rather for his aforeſaid worthines, our Sauiour put this part vpon him, honoured him with repreſentation of his Catholike Church, made him to ſignifie Eccleſiam vniuerſam, (S. Auſtens words) but onely to ſignifie it, & that not as an Apoſtle, but in a fourth conſideration, which helps you nothing, rather ſpoiles you of all.
               § 18. That which followes is pregnant, but I muſt be ſparing; though you may thinke we are afraid to enlarge quotations. Beſides, it hath beene brought totidem verbis before out of his 13. ſerm. de verb. Dom ſecundum Matth. the Father hauing recorded it in two ſeuerall places, ſo farre he was from retracting it; That, Petrus à petrâ, ſicut Chriſtianus à Chriſto, and not è contrà, that our boaſt ſhould not be in men, but in the liuing God. And yet in truth more plainely in this place, which may ſerue, if any thing, to open their eyes, that dare build vpon a man as the foundation of their Church, though it were Peter himſelfe, that I ſay not how vnworthy creatures now in his Roome. Ideo quippe ait Dominus, Super hanc petram aedificabo Eccleſiam meam, quia dixerat Petrus, Tu es Christus filius dei viui. Super hanc ergo inquit petram quam confeſſus es, aedificabo Eccleſiam meam. Petra enim erat Chriſtus, ſuper quod fundamentum ipſe etiam aedificatus eſt Petrus. Fundamentum quippe aliud nemo poteſt ponere, praeter id quod poſitum eſt, quod est Christus Ieſus. That is: For therfore ſaith our Lord, Vpon this rocke I will build my Church, becauſe Peter had ſaid, Thou art Chriſt, the Sonne of the liuing God. I will therefore build, ſaies he, my Church vpon

this rocke which thou haſt confeſſed. For the rocke was Chriſt, vpon which foundation euen Peter himſelfe was faine to be built. For another foundation can no man lay, beſides that which is laid, which is Ieſus Chriſt. Then, Eccleſia quae fundatur in Christo, claues ab eo regni coelorum accepit in Petro, id eſt, poteſtatem ligandi ſoluendi
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      peccata. How ſo? Quod enim eſt per proprietatem in Chriſto eccleſia, hoc eſt per ſignificationem Petrus in petrâ, qua ſignificatione intelligitur Christus petra, Petrus eccleſia. Haec igitur eccleſia quam ſignificabat Petrus, &c. that is to ſay, The Church which is founded in Chriſt, receiued of him the keyes of the kingdome of heauen in Peter, that is, the power of binding and looſing ſinnes. For that which properly the Church is in Chriſt, the very ſame by ſignification is Peter in the rocke. By which ſignification Chriſt is vnderſtood to be the rock, Peter to be the Church. This Church therefore which Peter ſignified, &c. I ſay nothing of ſignification, whereof enough before, and euery line in S. Auſten is fraught with it. But is not this ſtrange, that Peter whome they euery where aduance for the head, S. Auſten ſhould ſtill take for the bodie? In the perſon of the bodie, of the multitude of the faithfull, did our Sauiour heape thoſe priuiledges vpon Peter. And whereas ſome of you are not aſhamed to vrge Sequere me, for a document of his primacie, as if it were, Sequere me in gubernatione eccleſiae (a ſtrange probleme of deſperate pleaders,) euen there Peter differs not from the communitie, but ſtill ſtands for a figure of the bodie. Heare S. Auſten: Vniuerſitati dicitur, Sequere me, pro quâ vniuerſitate paſſus eſt Chriſtus. It is ſaide to the whole multitude, Follow me, for which whole multitude Chriſt ſuffered. For to conſtrue, Follow me, in ſo ambitious a ſenſe, that is, be Lord as I am Lord, be Regent as I am Regent, Chriſtian people will ſoone abhorre, though meanely inſtructed, who know we are to follow our Sauiour Chriſt by imitation of his vertues, not by affectation of his place, and Peter to follow him no otherwiſe then we

Peter: euen as Paul for the agreement of his ſpirit with them both, is not nice to call vs to the imitation of himſelfe, but yet ſubordinately to Chriſt, Bee ye followers of me, euen as I am of Chriſt, 1. Cor. 11. 1. And ſo abſurd is this argument for Peters Monarchy from Sequere me, that S. Auſten in his commentarie vpon the 62. Pſalme, conſtrues Sequere me, by vade poſt me: follow me, by get thee behind me. His words are, Redi poſt me Satanas, non enim ſapis quae Dei ſunt, ſed quae hominum. Then, Quia antecedere me vis, redi poſt me, vt ſequaris me, vt iam ſequens Chriſtum diceret, Agglutinata eſt anima mea poſt te: Becauſe thou wilt needs goe before me, get thee rather behind me, that ſo thou maieſt follow me. Though it be true alſo, that Sequere me, was a common word with our Sauiour, and ſpoken both to S. Matthew, when he called him to the Apoſtleſhip from the receipt of cuſtome, Matth. 9. and to him that preferred to goe and burie his father, before the following of his Maſter, Euſeb. Emeſ. in Hom. de Iohan. Euang. Quod Petro dicitur, omnibus dicitur, Sequere 
                        •
                     nc. Matth. 8. And if Peter obeyed the Sequere with the firſt of theſe two, in performing his ministerie, his ſucceſſors with the ſecond, while they leaue Chriſt to ſnatch at a mortuarie.
               
               § 19. I am afraid of giuing the Reader a ſurfet in a caſe ſo euident: but yet I muſt not omit this one paſſage, that followes in the forenamed Tractate of the Father vpon S. Iohn, becauſe our aduerſarie hath quoted it.
               § 20. He ſaies then, That as there is a two fold ſtate of the Church, one in miſery and in exile, another in glorie, in royaltie, and in bliſſe; ſo Peter was made a figure of the former, Iohn of the latter, by our Sauiour Chriſt. So as not onely Iohannes anteponitur Petro, Iohn in the one of theſe is preferred before Peter, (as S. Auſtens words are) but ſimply Iohn ſurpaſſeth Peter, as much as the life that we ſhall lead in bliſſe, excels this miſerable that here we liue. For thereafter as the liues are, ſo are the figures of them both, which are here ſaid to be theſe two Apoſtles, Peter of the militant Church, Iohn of the triumphaut, as hath beene

ſhewed. But ſhall wee ſay, trow you, that Iohn is a monarch in the triumphant, or beares any rule or regiment among the bleſſed, where the Sonne himſelfe reſignes his Kingdome, or ſubmits it at leaſt to God the Father, 1. Cor. 15.? Or if Iohn haue no ſuch monarchie by vertue of his figuring and repreſenting that ſtate, why then ſhould Peter claime any in earth, becauſe he ſtands for a figure of the militant? The words are ſomewhat long, but I will onely ſet downe as many as ſhall ſerue to giue the Reader light, the reſt may be viewed and dwelt on by leaſure. Duas vitas ſibi diuinitùs praedicatas & commendat as nouit eccleſia: quarum eſt vna in fide, altera in ſpecie: vna in tempore peregrinationis, altera in aeternitate manſionis: vna in labore, altera in requie vna in viâ, altera in patriâ: vna in opere actionis, altera in mercede contemplationis: vna declinat à malo & facit bonum, altera nullum habet, à quo declinet, malum, & magnum habet quo fruatur bonum: vna cum hoſte pugnat, altera ſine hoſte regnat: vna fortis eſt in aduerſis, altera nihil ſentit aduerſi: vna carnales libidines fraenat, altera ſpiritalibus delectationibus vacat: vna eſt vincendi curâ ſollicita, altera victoriae pace ſecura: vna in tentationibus adiuuatur, altera ſine vllâ tentatione in ipſo adiutore laetatur: vna ſubuenit indigenti, altera ibi eſt vbi nullum inuenit indigentem: vna aliena peccata vt ſua ſibi ignoſcantur, ignoſcit, altera nec patitur quod ignoſcat, nec facit quod ſibi poſcat ignoſci: vnaflagellatur malis, ne extollatur in bonis, altera tantâ plenitudine gratiae caret omni malo, vt ſine vllâ tentatione ſuperbiae cohaereat ſummo bono: vna bona & mala diſcernit, altera quae ſola bona ſunt cernit. Ergo vna bona eſt, ſed adhuc miſera, altera melior & beata. That is, Two ſorts of liues doth the Church of Chriſt know, intimated and recommended to her from God: whereof the one conſiſts in faith, the other in ſight: one in toyle and pilgrimage temporall, the other in reſt and eaſe eternall: one is of the way, the other of the countrey: one hath the taske of tedious action, the other the reward of bliſſefull contemplation: one flees from euill and does onely good, the other hath no euill to ſhunne at all,

but enioyes a good paſt all expreſſing. One continually copes with her enemies, the other triumphs without any enemie: one maintaines courage in the midſt of tribulation, the other is paſt ſenſe of any more trouble: one reſtraines carnall luſts and pleaſures, the other attends delights ſpirituall: one is carefull out of the deſire it hath to conquer, the other is at peace & ſecure like a conquereſſe: one finds helpe of God in temptation, the other reioyces in her helper God, ſcorning the tempter: one releeues the poore with her charitie, the other is there where there is no pouertie: one forgiues other mens ſinnes, that her owne may be pardoned, the other neither commits what ſhee ſhould wiſh to be forgiuen her, nor ſuffers ought of that which we pardon in another: one is chaſtened with ouils, leaſt ſhee be proud of the good, the other is ſo freed from all kind of euill by the fulneſſe of grace, that ſhee adheres to the cheife good without any danger of pride: one diſcerns the good from the euill, but the other ſees nothing but that which is good. So as the one is good, but as yet in miſeries, the other is better and in moſt perfect ioyes. Then followes. Iſta ſignificata eſt per Apoſtolum Petrum, illa per Iohannem. Ideo dicitur huic, Sequere me; de illo autem, ſi eum volo manore donec veniam, quid ad te? Tu me ſequere. Quid enim eſt hoc? Quantum ſapio, quantum capio, quid eſt hoc, niſi, Tu me ſequere per imitationem perferendi temporalia mala, ille maneat donec ſempiterna venio redditurus bona? That is, That life was ſignified by the Apoſtle Peter, this by Iohn. Therefore it was ſaid to him, Follow me. But of him thus, If I will haue him rarrie till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me. For what means that? As much as I conceiue, as much as I vnderſtand, what is it but euen this, Followe thou me by conformitie of ſuffering euils temporatie, & let him tarrie till I come, to repay the euerlaſting good. Do you ſee what a Sequere Peter is called to? Euen as much as S. Auſten either capit or ſapit, onely to the toleration of temporall iniuries, out of which you would

frame temporall Monarchies. To which purpoſe he had alſo ſaide a little before, ſetting a marke vpon it, Ecce propter quod ei dictum eſt, Sequere me. Namely becauſe Chriſt hauing ſuffered for mankind, left vs an example that we might follow his ſteps, S. Peter ſo expounding Sequere me, by, 
                     Ʋt ſequamur vestigia eius, 1. Pet. 2. 21. But go we forward as we began, in comparing the cōtemplatiue life with the actiue, Iohn with Peter, this world with the next. Amet ergo cum Petrus, vt ab iſtà mortalitate liberemur, and, ametur ab eo Iohannes, vt in illà immortalitate ſeruemur. That is, Let Peter therefore loue him, to the ende we may be deliuered from this preſent mortalitie, and let Iohn be loued of him, that we may be ſaued by him in the immortall glorie. Againe, Hoc per Petrum ſignificatum est, plus amantem, ſed minùs amatum, quia minùs nos amat Christus miſeros quàm beatos. Veritatis autem contemplationem qualis tunc futura eſt minùs amamus, quia nondum nouimus, nec habemus. Haec ergo per Iohannem ſignificata eſt minùs amantem, atque ideo & ad ipſam, & ad eius in nobis amorem, qualis ei debetur, implendum, donec veniat Dominus, expectantem: ſed plus amatum, quia id quod per illum figuratum eſt, hoc efficit beatum. That is, That was ſignified by Peter who loued Chriſt more, but was loued of him leſſe: becauſe Chriſt loues vs leſſe in the ſtate of miſerie, then he wil doe vs one day in the kingdome of glorie. We alſo leſſe loue the view of truth [and of the face of God] whiles we are as we are, becauſe we neither haue it yet, nor know it, as we ſhall doe. This life therefore of ours is ſignified by Iohn, who loued Chriſt leſſe, and therefore waits for his comming, til the other life may be reuealed, and the loue of it perfited as it ſhould be in vs: but the ſame Iohn was more loued of Chriſt, becauſe that [life] makes vs bleſſed, which in him was inſtanced; [or, figured.] Then, Nemo tamen istos inſignes Apostolos ſeparet. Yet let no man ſeuer theſe two excellent Apoſtles. So then, as one figures, ſo the other figures: as the one repreſents, ſo the other repreſents, and repreſents onely. Iohn was not hereby inſtalled

Monarch of heauen, no nor yet free deniſon thereof by actuall poſſeſſion. (It was long after that, that S. Iohn went to heauē.) No more was Peter, then, of earth, or any earthly prerogatiue: for they muſt not be ſeparated, but as one, ſo the other. Nemo ſeparet, ſaith S. Auſten. Et in eo (ſaith the ſame Father) quod ſignificabat Petrus, ambo erant, & in eo quod ſignificabat Iohannes, ambo futuri erant: ſignificando ſequebatur iste, manebat ille &c. That is, Both in that [life] which Peter ſignified, they were both of them, and in that which Iohn ſignified, they were both of them to be. He followed, this ſtaied, for ſignification ſake, &c. Doe you ſee that if Peter be a Monarch of the Church, Iohn muſt needes be too, which is a thing impoſſible? For, in eo quod ſignificabat Petrus, ambo erant, ſaith S. Auſten. That is, In that which Peter ſignified they were both of them. In whome yet it follows plainer, Nec ipſi ſoli, (Peter and Iohn forenamed) ſed vniuerſa hoc facit ſancta Eccleſia ſponſa Chriſti: ab istis tentationibus eruenda, in illa foelicitate ſeruanda. Neither Peter onely & Iohn, that is, two of the Apoſtles, but the whole Church of God, the ſpouſe of Chriſt, doth the very ſame: auoiding the tentation, which is here preſent, creeping on to the ſaluation, which is laide vp for vs in heauen. Quas duas vitas Petrus & Iohannes figurauerunt (as before ſignificabant, ſo now figurauerunt) ſinguli ſingulas &c. That is, Which two liues Peter and Iohn figured, the one the one, the other the other, &c. Laſtly, Omnibus igitur ſanctis ad Christi corpus inſeparabiliter pertinentibus, propter huius vitae procelloſiſſimae gubernaculum, ad liganda & ſoluenda peccata, claues regni coelorum primus Apostolorum Petrus accepit: ijſdem
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      omnibus ſanctis propter vitae illius ſecretiſſimae quietiſſimum ſinum, ſuper pectus Christi Iohannes Euangelista diſcubuit. Quoniam nec iste ſolus, ſed vniuerſa Eccleſia, nec ille in principio, &c. That is, In lieu therefore of all the Saints of Chriſt, which are inſeparably grafted into his myſticall bodie, as concerning their ſteerage, & the direction of their courſe, in this moſt troubleſome and tempeſtuous world, the prime Apoſtle Peter

receiued the Keies of the kingdome of heauen, for the binding and looſing of their offences. And againe in lieu of all the ſame Saints, with reſpect to that moſt quiet either boſome of ſecreſie, or harborough of bliſſe, the Euangeliſt Iohn leaned vpon the breaſt of our bleſſed Sauiour. Becauſe neither he alone, but the whole Church, nor the other in the beginning, &c.
               § 20. Againſt this I know what Mr. F. T. will ſay (for Bell, l. 1. de Pontif. Rom. c. 12. he ſayes no more then out of the mouth of his beſt maſters) As Iohn really, ſo Peter really: as the one lay vpon our Sauiours breaſt, and it was no fiction, ſo the other receiued the keies of heauens kingdome, and it was more then a bare repreſentation. Who doubts but S. Peter receiued the keies, as well as Iohn leaned on Chriſts boſome? But Peter receiued the keies in the perſon of the Church militant, becauſe our Lord would honour vnitie: & Iohn reſted and repaſted himſelfe on his ſacred boſome as a figure of the triumphant, to ſhadow out vnto vs the eſtate of glory and bliſſefull immortalitie. Each did as wee read they did, but with a drift to intimate ſome farther thing vnto vs. Non tibi ſed vnitati, may we ſay to S. Peter: and, Non tibi ſed aeteruitati, may we ſay to S. Iohn. Omnibus 
                  In liew of all the Saints belonging to the bodie of Chriſt. 
                  Sanctis ad Chriſti corpus pertinentibus, ſaies S. Auſten. And, Neither Peter alone, nor Iohn alone, but the whole Church. 
                  Quoniam nec iſte ſolus, nec ille ſolus, ſed vniuerſa Eccleſia. In this ſtands the anſwer, that both Peter receiued, and receiued for himſelfe, (for he had a part in the keyes as well as others, wee denie it not) but 
                     Beda in Concion, hyemal. in 16. Matth. Poteſtas ligandi & ſoluendi [per claues] quamvis ſoli Petro videatur à Domino data, abſ

Et, Omni igitur electorum eccleſie ligandi ac ſoluendi datur áuctoritas, iuxta modum culparum vel poenitentiae. Et paulò antè, Meritò tamen prae caeteris ei qiu maiori deuotione confeſſus erat Chriſtum, vt conſtaret omnibus, quiae abſ

                      eà confeſſione, & fide, regnum coelorum nullus poſſet intrare. An other manner of reaſon why the keyes are giuen to Peter, then the Ieſuites fancie.

                  , portionally and particularly, not wholly and entirely, ſaue onely as hee ſtood in the Churches roome, to grace vnitie. And this prooues no vniuerſall authoritie. As not Iohn in the triumphant, as not Iudas in the malignant, ſo neither Peter in the militant. But ſo much may ſuffice to haue ſpoken herof.
               
                  
§ 21. THE laſt place of S. Auſten that is cited for this purpoſe, is that which I firſt began with, de Agone Chriſt. c. 30. which becauſe this hobby-horſe cryes out vpon the Biſhop ſo, for alleadging fraudulently and lamely, as hath bin ſaid, I will keepe my promiſe to report it euen at large. Though in the 20. chapter of that booke, before we come to the place that is now to bee ſcanned, S. Auſten ſufficiently ſhewes what he meanes, by his wonted phraſe of gerere perſonam. Where he doubts not to ſay, ſpeaking of the head in a mans bodie, wherin all the ſenſes are lodged and recollected, that Caput ipſius animae quodam modo perſonam ſuſtinet: not as if the head did rule the ſoule, which were very vnreaſonable (as they would make Peter to bee gouernour of the Church, they care not how) but happily for Oculos quaſi ipſam

                     è extremo. reſembling the inviſible ſoule in viſible forme moſt liuely, and moſt apparantly, euen as Peter did the Church, one for many. And ſo it followes in S. Auſten, Ibi enim omnes ſenſus apparent. But ſpeake we to the 30. chapter, which is the thing in queſtion. Intreating there how the Church ought to ſhew compaſſion to her children, conuerting by repentance, he thus ſaies: Non enim ſine causâ inter omnes Apoſtolos, huius eccleſiae catholicae perſonam ſuſtinet Petrus. That is, For not without cauſe doth Peter among all the Apoſtles ſuſtaine the perſon of this Catholicke Church. Huic enim eccleſiae Claues regni coelorum datae ſunt: For to this Church, the keies of the Kingdome of heauen were giuen. Which latter FOR, is not to ſhow that Peter was choſen to beare the perſon of the Church, non ſine causâ, not without cauſe, as he had ſaid before, but to prooue what hee had ſuppoſed, that Peter did beare the Churches perſon; ſince the keyes are too great a depoſitum for Peter, to be receiued in his owne name, but in the Churches. And ſo much he had deliuered before vpon the 108. Pſalm. I will not now trouble the Reader to repeat it. Onely this may bee remembred, that there he ſaies, Tibi dabo claues, is among thoſe ſayings, which howſoeuer videntur pertinere ad

Petrum, non tamen habent illuſtrem intellectum, niſi cum referuntur ad eccleſiam, &c. which howſoeuer they may ſeeme to belong to Peter, yet cannot clearely be conſtrued, but when they are referred to the Church. This there. But now in this place he addes another example, to ſhew that Peter did beare the Churches perſon, and not his owne: As when, Paſce oues, is ſaid to him. Et cum ei dicitur, ad omnes dicitur, Amas me? Paſce oues meas. Where I cannot demaund without ſome paſſion, what can bee ſaid more pregnantly to the Biſhops purpoſe, that, Paſce oues, was not ſaid to Peter onely, when S. Auſten makes it common to all (all of the ranke at leaſt) and vouches it as an inſtance, that Peter did beare the perſon of the Church, and not his own only, in diuers things that paſſed vpon him? Me thinks vpon the alledging but of thus much out of S. Auſt. if truly, if in his ſenſe, the queſtion ſhould be at an end. Yet becauſe this man cries out againſt maimed allegations, I will keepe promiſe, as I ſaid, to ſet downe ſo much of S. Auſtens text, as no man comming after ſhall neede more: and that by the way it may be ſeene, whether this fellow can clip a text or no, for his aduātage, & leaue out that which is too hoat for him to meddle with; practiſing that impudently at the very ſame time, which he traduces the Biſhop for moſt wrongfully. Thus then S. Auſten: Debet ergò Eccleſia Catholica correctis & pietate firmatis filijs libenter ignoſcere, cùm ipſi Petro perſonam eius geſtanti, & cùm in mari titubâſſet, & cùm Dominum carnaliter à paſſione reuocâſſet, & cùm aurem ſerui gladio praecidiſſet, & cùm ipſum Dominum ter negâſſet, & cùm in ſimulationem poſteà ſuperſtitioſam lapſus eſſet, videamus veniam eſſe conceſſam, eum
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      correctum atque firmatum, vſque ad dominicae paſſionis gloriam perveniſſe. That is to ſay: The Church Catholicke therfore ought to pardon her children amending their faults, and eſtabliſhed in godlines, ſith we ſee pardon affoarded to Peter himſelfe, ſuſtaining the perſon of the church, both after that he had wauered in the ſea, & carnally dehorted our Sauiour frō ſuffering, and with a ſword cut

off the high Prieſts ſeruants eare, and finally fallen into his ſuperſtitious hypocriſie; [yet pardon I ſay affoarded him, notwithſtanding all theſe faults,] in ſo much as amended now and confirmed, he came in the ende to partake of the glorie of our Sauiours ſuffering. Here is nothing againſt vs, for ought I can perceiue, vnleſſe Peter to haue come to the glorie of our Lords ſuffering, may ſeeme to any to make againſt vs. Which yet I hope they will not conſtrue, as if Peter had died for the ſinnes of the world, and ſo equalled our Sauiours glorie. Wicked though they are, yet not ſo wicked, as to diuide that praiſe between Chriſt and Peter. Howſoeuer S. Auſten in his tractat vpon S. Iohn 123. makes this to be one of S. Peters errors, to haue offered to die for Chriſt in all haſt, pro liberatore liberandus &c. Wherein he might ſeeme to haue aſpired to a glorie more then our Sauiours, that he dying to ſaue the world, Peter ſhould die for him that died for the world, which is a point aboue the other. But howſoeuer they magnifie Peters authoritie, I hope they will attribute to him no ſuch vertue as this, although he may ſeeme, I ſay, to haue ſaid as much himſelfe when time was, by S. Auſtens collection; but rather repent with him repenting, as afterwards we know he changed his minde, and no doubt cried out as Iob doth, his eyes beeing opened, and his weaknes diſcouered, I bewaile my 
                  Iob 42. 
                  ſelfe in duſt and aſhes, I haue ſaid once, but I will ſay it no more. As for the wordes of S. Auſten, that Peter attained to the honour of our Lords ſuffering, it is a ſtorie in Euſebius worth the conſidering, how for the exceeding honour that hiſt. 3. 1. he bare to his Maſter,

not nice to graunt it to him, as the more diſgracefull. This was the reuerence that our Sauiours conuerſation begat in his Diſciples. In figure where of Iob, whome I named euen now, to ſhew the authoritie that he bare in his houſe, with ſemblable loue of all ſides, My ſeruants, ſaid he, thought

                  eate of his fleſh? for the vnſpeakable ſweetnes they found by me. See S. Chryſoſt. in his 2. Epiſt. to Olympias. Who can write of theſe things without melting paſſion? To conſider the ſtrange conflict betweene our Sauiour and S. Peter: a conflict of humilitie, not of pride, of loue, not of anger, like that betweene our Lord and the Baptiſt erſt, refuſing to thinke himſelfe worthie to baptize him. Which yet in Peter is more, to thinke himſelfe not worthie to die like him. Beſides, that Iohn was faine to yeild in the ende, but herin Peter had his deſire. And which is more ſingular, not onely the kind of ſtrife, to ſtriue for loue, but againſt the nature of loue, which delights in likeneſſe, that he ſhould chooſe a contrarie poſiture of bodie, to teſtifie his loue to his Lord and maſter. Indeede we haue thoſe now a daies in the Popedome, that loue to beare themſelues

T. euen now deſcribed, (where it is thought T ſhould ſtand before F, but for crookednes ſake,) not onely to controll Kings and Countries with their Vniuerſall dominion, but to challenge as much power as Chriſt himſelfe, the 
                  Adioynd. c. 1. num. 4. 
                  Head of the Church? And yet they make as if it were doubtfull, whether Anti-Chriſt be come yea or no, whether he ſit in the Church of God, ſhewing himſelfe for God, or no. But we haue ſtrayed out of the way, by occaſion of this mention, that S. Peter was exalted to the likenes or fellowſhip

of our Sauiours martyrdome. Which the Biſhop hauing abated them in his citation of S. Auſten, I confeſſe alſo they ſhould neuer haue heard from me, but that this man complained of lame allegations. As for the force it might ſeeme to carry, againſt our Sauiours ſingle and ſoueraigne ſacrifice, I ſhall neede to ſay no more then in the Apoſtles words, If one member ſuffers, all ſuffer with it; euen the head and all, but 1. Cor. 12. 26. then eſpecially I trow, when they ſuffer for the head, as S. Peter did ſuffer for the honour of his Maſter, in ſome likenes with his Maſter, and yet not daring to die too like his Maſter. And our Sauiour though in glorie, yet he cried from heauen, (that you may knowe hee is the true Dauid, whome Saul annoyeth,) Saul, Saul, Why perſecuteſt thou me? Which words, as if they had taught S. Paul what to thinke Act 9. 4. of the fellowſhip of ſufferings of the bodie myſticall, he is bold to ſay afterwards in his owne caſe, Adimpleo in corpore meo relliquias. paſſionum Chriſti, pro corpore eius quod eſt Eccleſia: 
                  Coloſſ. 1. I fulfill in my bodie the remainder of Chriſts ſufferings, for his bodie which is the Church. Where pro is exemplarie, not ſatisfactorie, againſt the Rhemiſts that dreame of a maſſe of paſſions, vpon that place. So doth the Maſſe forſooth runne in their mindes. But we ſpeake of his calling them paſſiones Chriſti, for ſympathie, and for proportion; of which enough.
               § 22. To returne to S. Auſten, and to conclude this whole matter with relating his text as largely as you can deſire. The ſumme is, that the Church muſt bee gratious toward her children, conuerting and returning by repentance, as our Sauiour was to Peter, the image of the Church, or the proxie of the Church (for I feare not to vouch that name by him, which hath euery where ſo good grounds in S. Auſten, as you haue heard) and bearing her perſon not without cauſe. For euen Peter (quoth he) found fauour after many defaults. Let her ſhew her ſelfe like Peter then, whome Peter figured, and the rather figured, becauſe himſelfe was a ſinner, yea a great ſinner, as the Church containes many offenders in her.
                  
That here alſo you may ſee another reaſon, Sir, though you haue beene twice anſwered to this queſtion before, why Peter rather then another figured the Church, namely, becauſe Peter beeing a great ſinner, and yet after his ſinnes finding greater grace, was ſo much the apter to repreſent her, which in both theſe kinds is verie notorious, both abundantis peccati, and ſuper-abundantis gratiae, of ſurpaſſing grace after exceeding guiltineſſe, Rom. 5. Our Sauiours Parable is not vnknowne to this purpoſe, Luk. 7. (propounded to a Simon, though not this Simon) which of the two debters ought more? The caſe was Peters owne, both a great debter, and releaſed of much, and perhaps our Sauiour deliuered it as in his hearing, ſo not without ſome reference to him ſtanding by. But at leaſt for this cauſe he bare the perſon of the Church. And ſo Petri lapſus potiùs

                     , as Bellarmine ſaies; Peters fall rather confirmes the primacie of the Pope. But you ſee what primatum, what kind of primacie, not to be vniuerſall Lord or rector, but the Churches type, or the Churches figure, to teach the Church as you would ſay, by way of liuely inſtance, to ſhew grace, as hee had found grace, and ſhee both in her owne, and his perſon. This was his maſterie that he had ouer the Church, to be maſter of mildneſſe, and we denie not but aboue the reſt of the Apoſtles. Doeſt thou loue mee more then theſe? Alas, how could he chooſe, to whome ſo much was forgiuen? then ſhew compaſſion.
               § 23. Now the faults of S. Peter, that S. Auſt. had ſet down, but not ſo F. T. no more then he durſt ſet downe his owne name aright, nay which purpoſely he leapes ouer, though they were incident to his allegation, as you may ſee in his firſt chap. num. 3. and yet blames the Biſhop for maimed quotations, they are theſe inſuing.  Firſt, his doubting vpon  the ſea. And if the ſea be his ſeat, or the whole Church, as they imagine, you ſee in what danger the Church is to haue a ſtaggering gouernour, I ſay ſtaggering euen in faith.  Secondly, his diſſwading our Lord from death: You 

will ſay, that was no great matter: of which neuertheleſſe you may be pleaſed to remember what our Sauiours cenſure was, heauie no doubt. He called him Satan. 
                   Thirdly, the ſnipping off of Malchus his care with a ſword, wherein  his pretended Succeſſors imitate him but too truely. What though they ſtrike no blow themſelues? Executio (ſaies Bellarmine) ad alios ſpectat. Let Seneca be heard. It is thou, Contr. Barcl. ſaith Seneca, ſpeaking to Alexander, (who tranſported by anger, commanded Lyſimachus to be caſt to a lyon, and ſo De Clem. lib. 1. cap. 25. torne in peeces, and deuoured) it is thou that openeſt thy iawes vpon him, it is thou that teareſt him in peices with thy teeth: Tuum illud os eſt, tua illa feritas. O quàm cuperes, &c. The like may be ſaid of Daniel and his enemies. But this, F. T. durſt not ſo much as once to mention, he knowes it makes ſo harſh a ſound. And therefore he fetches a leap from Peters doubting, to his denying, and pares away three of his errors with an & caetera, which S. Auſten had comprehended, and ſet downe in ſpecie. I haue heard of ſome, that thinke for Peter to drawe his ſword at Malchus, becauſe Malchus in Hebrew ſignifies a King, as we are taught by S. Ierome, de vitâ Malchi, was either a preſage, or a iuſtification of the Popes practiſes at this day. A preſage it might well be. But as for iuſtification, they may call to mind how our Sauiour approoued it, threatning the ſword to them that tooke the ſword, though it were Peter himſelfe: Matth. 26. 52. for euen to Peter were thoſe words directed. Not to them that beare the ſword, as committed to them by God, which is the right and the duty of the ciuill magiſtrate, but to them that Rom. 13. 2. Accipient iudiciun (

                  Tertull. moſt wittily, Patientia Domini in Malcho vulnerata eſt: Our Lords patience was wounded in Malchus: or, That which Malchus felt in his care, our Lord felt at his very heart. It diſpleaſed him ſo much, that a Churchman ſhould ſtrike. Therefore alſo hee healed the wound by miracle, and reſtored his care vnto him againe.

Which was not ordinarie, to doe miracles, for the cure of vnbeleeuers, ſpecially oppreſſours and impugners of his perſon; but that the importance of the cauſe ſo required it, and to ſhew how iniurious he accounted ſuch curteſie, when thoſe which are Church-men will draw the ſword, though it be in defence of his truth or perſon.
               § 24.  The fourth error there named, was his ter negâſſe Dominu,  triple deniall of his Lord and Sauiour. To which anſwers, as you haue beene told, his triple confeſſion, which makes way to the mandate of Paſce oues meas, exciting care, and ſtudie, and diligence, but importing nothing leſſe then Monarchicall iuriſdiction. Though S. Auſten alſo finde an other myſterie there, namely of Trinitie in vnitie, in the threefold confeſſion exhibited by one man, in the name of the Church, as we heard before out of his Tractate vpon S. Iohn: Confirmat Trinitatem, vt conſolidet vnitatem.

But ſo

much of theſe. I might adde more.
               § 26. For ſo it followes in S. Auſten, Pax in Domino reddita Eccleſiae à Principibus ſaeculi: peace in the Lord was afforded to the Church by the ſecular Princes. Which is as pleaſant to a Ieſuits eare to heare, as vineger to the teeth, or ſmoake to the eyes, as Salomon ſaies, to thinke that the outward welfare of the Church ſhould depēd on the Princes gratious aſpect, who if they be auerſe, they knowe a meanes worth two of S. Pauls, to reduce them to order, not by prayer or ſupplication to God for them, 1. Tim. 2. 1. for either they will inforce them, or make them rue it, either bow or breake, as the prouerb is. But S. Auſten euery where acknowledges Kings to be thoſe kind nurſing fathers, from whoſe gouernment flowes the Churches peace. And it is well knowne how he deriues it out of the ſecond Pſalme, Et nunc Reges intelligite, ver. 10. as if the meanes to order well the Church, and to promote the kingdome, of which it is ſaid a little before, in the ſame Pſalme, Yet haue I ſet my King vpon my holy hill of Sion, were the right perſwaſion of Princes concerning the faith. So as againſt Fauſtus the Manichee, lib. 12. cap. 32. he ſaies, the Emperours raging were the lyons deuouring, (S. Paul himſelfe calls Nero the lyon, not for nothing, but becauſe king of beaſts:) but againe when they conuerted and embraced the faith, and gaue ſuccour and ſupportance to ſuch as profeſſed relligion, then was Sampſons riddle verefied, then was honie foūd in the lyons mouth, then exforti exiuit dulce, and the mouth that afore roared againſt God, and his truth, (Quare fremuerunt is the lyons propertie in the Pſalme aforeſaid) then, munimenta latebraſ

                      dabat dulcedini verbi Euangelici, became a refuge, or a couering to the honie-combe of the Goſpel. And becauſe we ſpeake of lyons, which are ſoueraigne in their kind, kings of beaſts, ſaies Epiphan. haer. 77. it may not be forgotten how the ſame S. Auſten, more then once or twice, compares the enemies of Chriſtian religion, Kings and Emperours, to the lyons that Daniel was caſt vnto, amōgſt

whoſe hands neuertheleſſe God preſerued his Saints, for they that hurt the bodie could not hurt the ſoule, by our Sauiours ſaying; but when once they turned Chriſtians, and enacted Lawes, and decreed puniſhments, for the ſuppreſſing Epiſt. 50 & lib. 1. contr. Gaudent. c. 39. of Atheiſme, or hereſie, or Paganiſme, or whatſoeuer is contrarie to the glorious Goſpel of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, then they were like the lyons, which deuoured, not Deniel, but Daniels accuſers, and reuenged vpon them the wrong that they had done to him before. I ſee I ſhould be long, if I would bring, not all, but the leaſt part of the ſtore that is found here of in S. Auſtens workes. I will point onely to that in another place of his of the like argument, where, as here he aſcribes the temporall peace and proſperity of the Church, to the fauourable countenance of Chriſtian Kings; ſo, there to ſhew what authoritie they haue in the matters of God, he doubts not to ſet out their ſuppreſſing of hereſies, and Atheiſme, and ſchiſmes, in ſuch a peremptory ſort, as to ſay Poſt ſubuerſa idola, poſt flagellatum diabolum &c. Cuius ſimile habes apud S. Cypr. contra Demetrian. Torquentur ſpiritualibus flagris &c. Itē, de Idolot. van. Item, de bono Patient. Zabulus flagellatur cum Angelis ſuis. that they haue whipped & ſcourged the very deuills (the authors of the aforeſaid) both by ſea and land, both out of towne and countrey. It is well knowne, what enemies the Ieſuits are to the Kings entermedling with matters of this nature, to his handling the whip to laſh the deuill, for his ſowing of cockle amongſt good corne; whome they perhaps would exempt, as a ſpirituall perſon, from the Kings iuriſdiction, beſides that the cauſe is a cauſe of faith. But S. Auſten, though he knewe well that the deuill is not onely ſpirituall, but euen one of the ſpiritualia nequitiae in coeleſtibus, as S. Paul ſtyles him, Eph. 6. 12. one of the ſpirituall wickedneſſes in heauenly places, and ſo in regard euen of his place to be priuiledged, yet doubts not to put a whip into the Emperours hand, I ſay, nor cares not though he crie out, or the Ieſuits for him, Who art thou that torments vs thus without a calling? But we ſtray too farre. Howſoeuer it be, as I promiſed our gentleman to giue him good meaſure, ſo S. Auſtens ending muſt by no meanes be paſſed ouer, for the elegancie of it.
               
                  
§ 27. Speaking then againſt the Hereticks, deſcended of one Lucifer, that denied pardon to the conuerts of the Church, from which occaſion ſprang all this treatie about S. Peter, he thus ſaies; Hanc illi matris charitatem ſuperbè accipientes, & impièrepudiantes, quia Petro poſt galli cantum ſurgentinon gratulatiſunt, cum Lucifero qui mane oriebatur, cadere meruerunt. That is: Theſe men, either proudly and ſcornfully receiuing, or wickedly reiecting the charitie of their mother, becauſe they reioyced not with Peter riſing after the cock-crow, they iuſtly fell with Lucifer that earely-riſing ſtarre.
               § 28. We haue gone thorough the Chapter, which the Adioyner condemnes the Biſhop for lamely quoting. Yet I can hardly abſtaine from yeilding him ſomewhat, out of the next Chapter too, to fulfill his meaſure, to mingle him double in the cup, whereofhe complaines of the ſcantnes. Ita
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      miſeri (ſaies S. Auſten, ſpeaking ſtil of the Luciferians, but it fits but euen too wel with out ſtout-hearted Ieſuits) dum in Petro petram non intelligunt, & nolunt credere datas eccleſiae claues regni coelorum, ipſi eas de manibus amiſerunt. They haue loſt the keyes whilſt they talke ſo much of them, and all becauſe they vnderſtand not, or will not vnderſtand, Petrum in petrâ, that is, Eccleſiam in Chriſto, as S. Auſten before expounded it in his 13. Serm. de verb. Dom. ſecundum Matth. that is, the Church in Chriſt. So neither Peter the petra, as they would faine make him, nor Peter at all, but Petrus in petra, that is, Eccleſia in Chriſto, or populus Chriſtianus, and fidelis in Chriſto, the Church in Chriſt, or the number Vide Bedam, vt ſuptà. of the faithfull, as they are recollected in Chriſt, is it to whome the keyes are here giues. But F. T. and his fellows, nolunt credere datas Eccleſiae claues regni coelorum, will not beleeue that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen were giuen to the Church, and why, but quia Petrum in petrá non intelligunt, they will not vnderſtand the myſterie of Peter, not in himſelfe, but in the rocke, that is, in Chriſt: S. Auſtens propheſie, their propertie at this day.
               
                  
§ 29. It followes in him yet, againſt ſuch as forbid ſecond marriages. Qui 
                  S. Hierome was of another minde, for the puritie of Marriage; (though reputed ſomewhat partiall) then either theſe hereticks, or the Papiſts. Com. in Tit. 2. Credant coniugati ſe opera libirorum perpetrare ante oculos Dei & Angelorum. Therefore not reprehenſible. S. Chryſoſtome ſaies, that yong men go crowned to their marriage, in the places of Greece, where he liued, to ſhew they haue triumphed ouer the luſts of youth, and are now paſt daunger of temptation. Com. in 1. Tim. 3. Serm. 9. in Ethico. And againe, that our Saniour turned water into wine, at a marriage, to ſhew the power and the effect of marriage, which is to reſtrain the frailties of nature, as wine hath a binding quality ouer water, Ipſo fine Com. in Epiſt. ad Coloſſ. Origen in 17. Gen. hom. 3 ſaies that Abraham and his wife deſerued to be called Pretbyteri, and were ſo indeede, that is to ſay Prieſts: for he conſtrues himſelfe to meane, not age, but ripeneſſe of vnderſtanding. See you to what dignitie married women may come, not onely men? See laſtly S. Auſien cont. Fauſt. l. 5. c. 9. where he iuſtifies holy marriage againſt Fauſtus and his inpure litter, by thoſe places of the Apoſtle, where in he giues rules to families; as husbands, wiues, fathers, children, maſters, ſeruants, as carefully as Ignatius, or Frances, euer did to their Fraternities. Which is a ſigne of the reuerent eſtimation that he had of them. Quid dicemus de illis, quorum domoi tam ſolerti & diligenti curá componit Apoſtolus? &c.
                   
                  cum ſuper Apoſtolicam doctrinam ſe mundiores praedicent, ſinomen ſuum vellent agnoſcere, mundanos ſe, potiùs quàm mundos, vocarēt. Who pretending themſelues cleaner farre then the Apoſtles doctrine, are found to be cleane beſides all praiſe of cleannes. If you aske, why ſo? the reaſon is rendered in the next words; Cogunt viduas ſuas vri, quas nubere non premittunt. Non enim prudentiores habendi ſunt quàm Apoſtolus Paulus, qui ait, Malo eas nubere quàm vri. They compell, ſaies he, their widowes to burne, whome they forbid to marrie, whereas they ſhould not be coū
                  ted wiſer then the Apoſtle Paul, who ſaies, I had rather they ſhould marrie then burne. But no doubt while they affect a purity aboue the Apoſtles doctrine, they might giue themſelues, if ſo it pleaſed them, a name more agreeable to their filthie ſect. The world hath not yet forgotten, how roundly Bellarmine replies vpon his MAIESTIE, moderately cenſuring their reſtraint of mariages, which yet they would haue to be ſo many Sacraments, that marriages before the vow indeede are Sacraments, but after that, ſacriledges. S. Auſten makes it free here for all to marrie, that find themſelues to be 
                     They compell to burn: whō they forbid to marrie, ſaith S. Auſten, implying, continence is not ſo cheape or vulgar as the Papiſts giue out. For then, what compulſion to burne, I pray you, though marriage were forbidden? in daunger of burning, windowes and all, and who knowes but vowed and profeſſed widowes? The rule is generall, and he applies it generally, without any limitation, Malo eas nubere quàm vri: I had rather they ſhould marrie then burne: frō which it is not to be thought he would excuſe any. S. Paul himſelfe,

1. Tim. 5. 12. though he ſpeake of widowes, that had giuen their firſt faith, ſuppoſe, as you conſtrue it, their faith and vow to remaine widowes, yet afterward in the 14, he giues them leaue to marrie, ſince they could keepe it no better; I will haue younger widowes marrie. Where it were hard to conſtrue yonger widowes twice named, v. 12. and 14. and one time condemned for their wantonneſſe after vow, deſiring to marrie, another time licenſed to marrie, as for remedie, (They will marrie, v. 12. and S. Paul, I will haue

Whereto he addes the reaſon, Becauſe the higher pitch, the greater fall. I might ſhew the ſame out of Lib. 1. Ep. 11. ad Pompon. S. Cyprians words are theſe: Si ſe ex fide Chriſto dicauerunt, pudirè & caſtè perſeverent: ſi perſeverare nolunt, vel non poſſunt, melius eſt vt nubant, &c. And Epiphanius himſelfe may ſeeme to ſay as much, where he is thought to ſay the contrarie: viz haereſi 61. qua Apoſtolicorum eſt. Melius eſt lapſum à curſu, palàm ſibi vxorem ſumere ſecundum legē, &c. It is better for him that is ſtūbled in his courſe [of intended continence] to marry a wife in the ſight of the world according to law, then &c. As for that, Peccatum eſt converti ad nuptias poſt virginitatem decretam: Firſt, a light name, Peccatum, not Sacrilegium. Secondly, Peccatum, id eſt, non ſine peccato, by reaſon of the raſh vow. And Epiphanius allowes ſoone after, that melius eſt vnum peccatum habere quim plurae, which concernes this caſe very neerly. Beſides that thoſe Councells which cōdemne this inconſtancie, puniſh it but lightly, and command not the marriage to be diſſolued, as in other caſes. See Concil. Neocaeſar. Can. 2.

               § 30. ANOTHER teſtimonie conforme to that of S. Auſtens, to ſhewe either the force, or the extent of the commiſſion giuen to Peter in Paſce oues meas, the Biſhop produced out of S. Ambroſe, another of the fowre Doctors of the Church, of their owne regiſtring, that it may ſatisfie the more. In ore duorum, praeſertim tanti, teſtium. De ſacerdotali dignitate, as now the title runnes, though it hath runne otherwiſe in times paſt, cap. 2. not as F. T. wrongly cites, the firſt. Quas oues, & quem gregem, non ſolùm tunc B. ſuſcepit Petrus, ſed & nobiſcum eas ſuſcepit, & cum illo eas nos ſuſcepimus omnes. That is, Which ſheep, and which flocke, not onely Bleſſed Peter then receiued, but both he receiued them with vs, and with him we all haue receiued them. As for the pregnancy of this teſtimonie, and that it toucheth to the quicke, what need we ſay more, when we haue our aduerſary confeſſing, Cap. 1. num. 7. Adioynd. that this manner of ſpeech doth indeede inforce a greater equalitie betwixt S. Peter and other Paſtors, then euer S. Ambroſe did imagine, he meanes then can ſubſiſt with their ſuppoſed primacie or Papacie of Peter. But how does he anſwer it? Forſooth they are ſaid not to bee Ambroſe his words, not thoſe at leaſt, & nobiſcum eas ſuſcepit, both he receiued them with vs, &c. And why ſo? Becauſe firſt they are contrarie to Ambroſe his iudgement in other places, but ſpecially becauſe they are not extant in the printed

copies, and in a word are meerely of the Biſhops forging.  A great fault, if it can be prooued; if not, a great ſlaunder, as  all men may ſee, and ſufficient to cracke the Adioyners credit, through out the reſt of his whole booke. It may pleaſe the Reader then to vnderſtand; that of ſundry editions of S. Ambroſe which haue been ſet forth, though we could not come by all to conſult them; yet ſo many are foūd to haue thoſe words, which he quarrels to be foiſted, as may eaſily ſhew, on which ſide the corruption lyeth, ours for adding, or theirs for defacing and with-drawing. Fiue editions at Baſile, and all in ſeuerall yeares are found to haue them: Ann. 1506. 1516. 1527. the firſt of Iohannes Petri à Langendorfe his ſetting forth, the third is Eraſmus firſt edition. Adde another at Baſile, ann. 1538. And yet a fift of Coſterius his edition, ann. 1567. all which haue them. Of Paris likewiſe fiue: one, ann. 1529. another, 1539. a third, 1549. a fourth, 1569. a fift, 1586. And ſo we might goe ouer a great many more, but here is tenne for any one that can be ſhewed yet to haue them not. Though as wee daily ſeeke, we find more daily: as a ſixt edition at Baſile, ann. 1492. ancienter then any that hath been cited yet, and further off from any likelihood to be corrupted by the Biſhop. Adde hither foure manuſcripts, which haue them all. One which is now in his Maieſties librarie, ſometimes belonging to the Monaſterie of Rocheſter, giuen by OſKetel a monke before the conqueſt, faire written, and without all exception. True it is that S. Ambroſe his booke is entituled there, Sermo de obſeruantiâ Epiſcoporum; but it is the ſame word for word, with De dignitate ſacerdotali, the booke which we now treat of. An other is of Merton colledge in Oxford, which hath alſo thoſe words; though the title of the booke be changed, as in the former, yet vtterly the ſame it is for ſubſtance. It is there intituled, De obſeruantijs Epiſcoporum, qui inſcribitur Paſtorale; but the ſame, as I ſaid. The third is of Peter-houſe librarie in Cambridge, which they that will conſult may finde the words in, and

ſee the ſlaunder confuted with their eies. A fourth in Sidney Colledge librarie, of the ſame Vniuerſitie, giuen by Mr. Maſcall, which to this purpoſe hath been conſulted, and is found to haue them. We will neuer denie but Sixtus quintus his edition, which he ſet out at Rome, before hee was Pope, and ſo the leſſe irrefragable forſooth, hath them not. And accordingly an other edition of Paris, ann. 1603. which profeſſes to goe ſtep by ſtep with that of Rome, leaueth them out. But what is that to controule ſo many auncient editions? Or does it not ſhew, that thoſe words are ſo effectuall againſt your primacie (as your ſelfe at a bluſh confeſſed ere-while, ſaying that S. Ambroſe neuer meant to bee ſo liberall) that becauſe you could not wreſt them with any forged interpretation, you had rather cut them out then abide the hazard? And yet it is found, that between the Rome edition, of which I ſpake euen now, and that of Paris, ann. 1603. profeſſing to followe it in euery point, there is an other of Paris, ann. 1586. which retaines the ſaid words in ſpight of Rome. Concerning the Lyons, or rather the lyars edition of ann. 1559. by Frellonius, you may pleaſe to read what Iunius reports of his owne knowledge, in his preface to the Index expurgatorius; you will not onely quit the Biſhop from ſuch blame, as now you caſt vpon him moſt vnworthily, but acknowledge to your ſhame, that as you haue vſed ſmall conſcience towards any of the Fathers, ſo leaſt to Ambroſe, of all other, for abuſing him. I will ſet downe a little of the ſtorie that hee tells there, and ſo paſſe on to your next argument. When I The fellonious Edition of S. Ambroſe at Lyons. was at Lyons, ſaith he, in the yeare 1559. I was acquainted with a certaine corrector of the Preſſe, whoſe name was Ludouicus Saurius. And comming one day to viſit him, I found him by chance, or rather by the ſpeciall prouidence of God, reuiſing S. Ambroſe's works, which then Frellonius was in printing. And after much talke on both ſides, when I had told him I would not hinder his worke, he reading afreſh a page of that worke, Do you ſee (quoth he) the

faſhion of this our edition of Ambroſe, how neat, how accurate, and if you regard the ſight, to bee preferred before all that haue been yet printed? Afterward as I conſidered and applauded the goodnes of it; Well, for all that (quoth he) if I were to buy me a copy of Ambroſe, I would buy any rather then this that you ſee. And demanding of him the reaſon of his ſo ſaying, he brought out certaine pages out of the decks vnder his table, in which pages there were two rowes one againſt the other, ſuch as they call cancellatioperis, and thus added: Looke you (quoth he) this is the firſt forme of our pages, which within theſe few dayes we printed after a copy of verie good credit. But two Franciſcan Friers by their authoritie daſhed all this good work, and in place of the firſt ſheets, made vs print theſe that you ſaw euen now, cleane beſides all the direction of our copies, with no ſmall hinderance and trouble to Frellonius, &c. This reports Iunius of his owne experience, touching your corrupting of Saint Ambroſe; And ſo much of that point.
               § 31.  Your other argument is drawne from certaine  places of that Father, which ſeeme contrarie to this, you ſay, and ſo this not to be admitted for his. The firſt is vpon the 12. of the ſecond to the Corinth. Primatum non accepit Andreas ſed Petrus: Not Andrew, but Peter, receiued the primacie. The other, lib. 10. comment, in Luc. cap. 24. Quia ſolus profitetur ex omnibus Petrus, ideò omnibus antefertur. Becauſe Peter onely profeſſes emong them all, therefore he is honoured or preſerred before all. Which the Biſhop had aſſoyled euen before they were alleadged, acknowledging, as I haue ſaid, two ſuch primacies in Peter, as no way croſſing with S. Ambroſe, no way aduantage your cauſe. The firſt is ordinis, the ſecond praeſtantiae. The one of order, the other of eminencie. And the one in one, the other in the other teſtimonie of S. Ambroſe may be conceiued. Accepit primatum, you ſay. A primacie of order beeing to be giuen to ſome, to auoide confuſion, as we ſhall afterward ſhew,

the Lord that diuideth inter flammas ignium, and much more betweene one brother and another, which comes ſaliens & tranſiliens, as it is in the Cant. and of two bedfellowes, of two grinders at the mill, receiues one, refuſes the other, preferd Peter before Andrew his brother. What is this to the Popedome? what to a Monarchie? what, I ſay not to their ſtately, but euen ſtatarie and ordinarie ſupremacie in the Church? Was this to deſcend from S. Peter to his heires? which we are told here is ſo aliene from carnall prerogatiue, that therefore it was giuen to Peter before Andrew, to ſhew it is meerely of diuine diſpoſition. Though the more I conſider S. Ambroſe his words, the more me thinkes they fall vpon another anſwer of the Biſhops, and that proper enough. He ſpeakes in one word of primatus communis,

                  , ſo Gal. 2. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : ſo here in this very place that S. Ambroſe comments vpon, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Which was a primacie of many, and S. Paul himſelfe had a place in it, though called after Peter was made a Monarch, if euer he was made, euen as Ambroſe here confeſſes; Hoc erant quod & Apoſtolus Paulus: They were the ſame that Paul, and Paul that they. The wonder then lies here. Andrew that followed firſt (that by the way you may ſee how little ſenioritie preuailes in Gods ſchool, which yet you ſo truſt vnto) receiued not the primacie that Peter did, that is, was none of thoſe three primi wherof Peter was. Neither ſay ye, that becauſe Peter onely is mentioned here, onely oppoſed to Andrew, therefore only Peter receiued the primacie in S. Ambroſes meaning. For Peter is oppoſed to Andrew, as one brother to another, and the iunior to him which is knowne to haue reſorted more carely to Chriſt, which compariſon betweene him and others were not ſo cleare. For euen Andrew brought Peter to Chriſt, Ioh. 1. Now the other primatus, which is primatus praeſtantiae, as the Biſhop had called it, and ſo foyled this fellowes friuolous obiections, euen before they were hatched,

belongs to the other place. Quia ſolus profitetur, ſolus antefertur. But anteferri is one thing, praeponi another. The latter may be of authoritie, the firſt of any excellencie. Doe I ſeeme once againe too grammaticall to you? To you perhaps: but how doe you gainſay me? Anteferri, I ſay, is one thing, as to be eſteemed before another, to be graced before another, like anteire, antecellere, and if you haue any more like. For it was not no grace for S. Peter here, to be bid to feede, as a common man, an vniuerſall man, as one in whoſe perſon the others were exhorted, and as S. Auſten ſaies, the Church repreſented. Thus, quia ſolus profitetur ex omnibus, omnibus antefertur. And laſtly, martyrij corona decernitur, as S. Ambroſe here ſaies, he is promiſed martyrdome in thoſe words, Cum ſenueris &c. which is no ſmall glorie. In which place alſo by the way, you may ſee the libertie of Eccleſiaſticall men, that you ſo ſtand vpon. When Peter was yong, that is, before he was Apoſtle, he might go whither Ioh. 11. he would. Afterward he was to follow againſt his will. Is this exemption? But becauſe you conferre place with place, to perſwade vs that we conſtrue S. Ambroſe amiſſe, I hope you will giue vs the like leaue hereafter, to conferre diuerſe places of the Fathers with themſelues, before wee aſſent to that which you produce out of them. And yet it followes in S. Ambroſe, after, omnibus antefertur, as it were by way of reaſon, Maior enim omnibus charitas eſt: for charity is greater then all. So as Peters anteferri, is neither grounded vpon his priuiledge of retaining the faith, as you would make it, of his loue rather, which you confeſſe often to haue failed in your Popes, (as if the after-name Peter had aboliſhed Simon, qui interpretatur obediens, as Beda notes) and the prioritie, if he had any aſſigned him ouer others, Serm. In Cath. Petri. is onely like Charities among other virtues, which is to be principall indeede, but not to rule. The virtues of the proſequutiue part rule not the intellectuall, but are ruled rather. So Faith and Loue.
               § 33. As for vicarium amoris, which is another thing

that you vrge out of his Comment vpon Luke, that Chriſt left Peter the Vicar of his loue, or the deputie of his loue, as if therefore he were that Vicar of his power, or iuriſdiction that you imagine, what ſo vnlikely? Of the Vicar of our Sauiour you may read in S. Iohn, cap. 16. Alium paracletum 
                  & cap. 14. De praeſcrip. 
                  dabit vobis: and Tertullian hath been told you to giue that to the holy Ghoſt. He is the Paraclete. Though you haue Cletus and Anacletus, yet neuer a Paracletus, the Vicar of our Lord, properly ſo called, in all the ranke of your Popes. For we muſt deſire you now, that we may haue no Montanizing. Though, I ſuppoſe, you are not ignorant, what an ornament of yours had like to haue been tranſported, with the enticing prophecyes and Siren-ſongs of Miſtreſſe Maximilla, when time was. S. Auſten alſo anſwerably in his ſermon vpon the Epiphanie, 185. Datur vicarius Redemptoris, meaning the holy Ghoſt: and yet he addes, Vt quod ille redemit, iſte ſanctificet, quod ille inchoauit, iſte conſummet. Is this Peter? Does he ſanctifie thoſe whom Chriſt redeemed? or does hee perfect that which Chriſt began? But Ambroſe cals Peter vicarium amoris, the deputy of Chriſts 
                  
                     Heb. 7. 24. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Bellarm. calls it blaſphemie, to ſay the holy Ghoſt is Chriſts vicarius.
                   
                  loue. And who doubts, but as Chriſt hath no proper deputie in the courſe of his gouernement, vnleſſe you wil admit the holy Ghoſt before named, which Bellarmine denies to doe, ſo, in a modified ſenſe, the Vicars of his loue were as many as loued her in his abſence, whom he loued, and imployed all their care to benefit his Church? which was not one mans charge, but all the Apoſtles, and not onely the Apoſtles, but all miniſters, to the ende of the world. Alij paſtores vicarij ſunt illius paſtoris, ſaies Lyra vpon Ioh. 10. 16. Yea Ambroſe himſelfe; Omnes Epiſcopi (if not Preſbyteri) ſunt vicarij Chriſti, vpon 1. Tim. 5. 19. And you may adde the two Euſebij, one of Rome in his Epiſt. ad Epiſc. Tuſciae & Campaniae, if it be not forged by you, Caput Eccleſiae Chriſtus eſt, Chriſti autem vicarij ſacerdotes ſunt.

Peter, ſauing that he was to doe the workes of loue as an Apoſtle) is no more then is inioyned to euery Chriſtian. Though S. Ambroſe ſay onely velut vioarium amoris, not daring to ſay vicarium cleane out, as the nature of his office, as you would make it, but ſhewing that he ſpeaks in a borrowed phraſe, and as it is proper to none, ſo in that extent perhaps befitting many. Therefore Bellarmine leaues the velut clean out, citing this authoritie, de Pont. Rom. l. 1. c. 25.
               § 34. THERE is yet behind another graue obſeruation out of S. Ambroſe, that Peter is not bid now to feede the lambes, or little ſheepe, but ones ipſas,

As I thinke Paul fed him, and that with his ſtaffe too, tipt with iron, (I haue heard ſome conſtrue virgam ferream ſo, Apoc. 2. and Pſal. 2. as alluding to the ſheepehooke) I meane with his reproofe, and that at Antioch his owne ſeat, not onely with fodder, or with greene bowes.

Nay, how if the Ieſuit haue ſo miſtaken himſelfe, in his curious diſtinction betweene lambs and ſheepe, that he hath cleane exempted both Apoſtles and Kings from Peters iuriſdiction, to bring whome in, and to range them within the compaſſe of that ſupreme power, the diſtinction onely was at firſt deuiſed? For if oves and agni onely, be S. Peters walke, and he the ſheepeheard,

Thus argueth this learned and ſharpe Doctor; ouerthrowing his owne argument ſufficiently by his owne concluſion, graunting in effect, that if the Prieſts were not a part of the people Iſrael, the King was not their Paſtor. Theſe are his prefaces, if wee had time to ponder them. And yet it is almoſt the modeſteſt clauſe in the Book, of them wherein he beſpeakes the Biſhop, that the Reader may pardon me, if now and then I be mooued, euen more then he is aware, or pitie me when I am compelled (as often I am for want of leiſure) to ſwallow ſuch curteous girds in ſilence. The ſumme is, that in anſwering to the Biſhops retortion, hee would haue the Prieſts to bee no part of Iſrael. And once againe you ſhall diſcerne the ſpirit of the man, who thus ſets forward. To this purpoſe then it is to be conſidered, what I haue amply debated

in the firſt Chapter of my Supplement, concerning the exemption and ſeparation of the Prieſts and Leuites from the temporall eſtate, by the expreſſe words of Almightie God, Numb. 8. who gaue the Leuites to Aaron, and his children, not to the temporall Prince: Tradidi eos dono Aaron, & filijs eius, de medio populi. And againe, Num. 1. The tribe of Leui ſhall not be numbred, nor haue any part with the reſt of Iſrael, but the Lord muſt be their poſſeſſion, portion, and inheritance. I muſt bee ſhort. And ſo ſhaking off the Supplement, with other idle complements, though he is not aſhamed to ſet a trūpet to his Phariſaicall cheeks, and euerie where to diſplay his owne worke, as if there were no other ſtorehouſe of learning in the world, no file but this Philiſtines to whet a witte vpon, conſider we as well as we can, what is to bee ſaid to this point, of the exemption of Leuites from the ſtate politick, that is, from their ſubiection to ciuill Magiſtrates: for elſe he ſaies nothing, ſith we knowe the Leuites were not lay-men, and the Prieſts Prieſts, not populars. Yet he implyes ſuch a thing, when hauing quoted the text, and not daring to vtter that audacious propoſition, that Prieſts were not ſubiect to the ciuill Magiſtrate, he ſaies onely this, that God reſerued them for his owne ſeruice: which no doubt is the true meaning of the place, but how doth this ouerthrow ciuill obedience?
               
               § 37. To ſpeake particularly to the places. As for Num. 1. (to beginne with that) Non numerabitur tribus Leui, I could ſend him to a place, as he does vs, where hee ſhould finde his anſwer, if Datin be no eie-fore to him, alreadie ſhaped to a man of his coate; and as it ſeemes verie reuerently eſteemed by him; I meane Iohn Eudoemon of Crete: but the ſumme is this. A viewe of the people was to be taken there, either as landed men, or ſufficient for the wars. From both which the Leuites beeing exempt by calling, what maruell if with the reſt they are not to bee leuied? Therefore children are not numbred, nor yet women, but as it is in the ſecond and third verſes, though often repeated

throughout the Chapter, the more to condemne the blindneſſe of this beetle-head: Quicquid ſexús eſt maſculini à viceſimo anno & ſuprà, omnium virorum fortium ex Iſrael: Whatſoeuer is of the male-ſexe, from the twentieth yeare and vpward, of all the valiant men of Iſrael. Are women and children therefore, nay all vnder twentie, exempt from authoritie? Alſo Origen hom. 1. in Num. finds no ſuch myſterie, but makes it a token of perfection, to be numbred cum populo Dei, as the Apoſtles and Diſciples (ſaith he) whoſe very haires of their head were numbred, &c. And ſo likewiſe in the reſurrection, Alius (ſaith he) numerabitur in tribu Levi, credo qui benè praefuit ſacerdotio, alius in aliâ tribu. So that he makes Levi to be numbred too. Laſtly, Ruport in his Comment. vpon the place, ſees no other myſterie in theſe words, ſaue that Clergie men ſhould by all meanes withdraw themſelues from ſecular affaires, as the holy Canons (ſaies he) haue decreed.
               
               
                   Now, that God is their portion, & that they may haue no foote of land in the land, which is another thing that F. T.  here amplifies the ſeparation of the Leuites by, though it is not vnknowne what cities the Leuites enioyed by aſſignement afterward, yet what is that to the purpoſe? Onely I confeſſe they are ſo much the fitter to be exempted from ſubiection, if, their lands being taken from them, they haue the leſſer meanes now to nouriſh ſedition. But what ſaies The Archbiſhop of Roane was of another minde for Biſhops caſtles. Chron. Angl noſtrae ſub Rege Stephano.
                   
                  Mariana de Inſtitit. Prino. l. 1? Ego volo Epiſcopis firmiſſimas arces tradi: I will haue Biſhops to be maſters of the ſtrongeſt or ſtatelieſt caſtles. Theres a Leuite of the Ieſuits, or a prettie leuorite rather, to ſucke a Kings heart-blood in time.  Concerning Num. 8. I haue giuen them to Aaron and his ſonnes for a gift, from the midſts of the people, they are  giuen for ſeruice in the holy calling vnder Aaron, not for any ſuch dependance and obligation towards him, as if thereby they were exempt from the authoritie of the Magiſtrate. Though the Ieſuite crie out here, as hauing attained a conqueſt, Not to the temporall Prince, but to Aaron. As

if the temporall Prince had loſt the Leuite, after once God had giuen them to Aaron. Where firſt I might aske him, whether Aaron were exempt himſelfe or no? If not, why the Leuites, and he not? if ſo, by what gift, by what donation of God? For giuing them to Aaron, hee left Aaron as he was, for ought we read. He will ſay, Aaron was his before; which I graunt, for ſeruice, but where by exemption from the ciuill Magiſtrate? What text, what euidence hath he for that? And will he hold that courſe in making free of apprentiſes, as to cancell the indenture, or get the Maſters releaſe afore he thinke them free, and not the ſame in diſanulling ſubiection to a Prince? Now, we know how Aaron was taunted by Moſes, for making Exod. 32. 21. the calfe. Which is a ſigne that this diſcharge from obedience is a fiction. Neither challenge we any other ſupremacie of Princes ouer the Clergie, ſaue in the like caſe to puniſh the exorbitant. Beſides, God here giues the Leuite to Aaron, as giuen to him freely by the people. Quos dediſtis mihi, dono Aaroni, v. 16. & 18. See you then what the people may doe in the choice of their Miniſter? which Bellarmine by no means can be brought to digeſt at his MAIESTIES hāds, alledging it out of Cyprian, as anciently practiſed: here you ſee allowed by God himſelfe in a ſort, that the people ſhould offer and ſet apart to him their Prieſts. And if the peoples giuing of the Leuite to God, did not ſet them free, why ſhould Gods deliuering them backe to Aaron? Is Aarons protection more ſoueraigne then Gods, to priuiledge the Leuite? Yea you inthrall the Prieſts to the people vnaware, whiles you labour to exempt them from the Princes authoritie. For you make the people the firſt author of their infranchizoment, as giuing them to God, and God to Aaron, by which they hold. Laſtly, the Leuites v. 18. were giuen to Aaron, as is manifeſt by this place, onely in lieu of the firſt borne of the children of Iſrael, Opinio haec eſt Rabbi Moyſis, & laudatur à Lyrano in locum. becauſe they by their default and odious idolatry, had made themſelues vnworthie to doe God ſeruice. I demand

then: were the firſt borne exempted before, or no? if ſo, by what charter? for you bring no euidence but this of the Leuites, Num. 8. If not, how could the ſingle putting of others in their roome, to ſupplie for them in diuine offices, affoard ſuch priuiledge to the deputies, as the originall miniſters neuer enioyed? But to perſwade you yet more fully, that no more is implied in theſe words, then onely to put in one for the other, the Leuites for the firſt borne, that Aaron and his ſonnes might not be deſtitute of ſome to ſerue them, in their religious performances, (beſides that the 20. verſe ſpecifies ſo much, where the execution is deſcribed of all that is here commanded, and yet it reaches no further then onely to the application of Aaron and his ſons to diuine ſeruice, together with the Leuites, as Lyra well obſerues, without any ſpeech of the leaſt exemption from ciuill authoritie) pleaſe you to heare your owne Doctors ſpeake. Firſt Toſtatus as the more worthie. I haue read that this Toſtatus emulated Turrecremata, another prop of your primacie, both contending at one time who ſhould doe the Pope moſt ſeruice. Though he got the Cardinalſhip, yet you are not wont to deſpiſe the Biſhop for his learning. Thus he ſaies. [Tradidi eos dono Aaron & filijs eius. 
                  In 8. Num. quaeſt. 21. I haue giuen them for a gift to Aaron and his ſonnes.] Id eſt, Leuitas acceptos pro primogenitis Deus tradidit Aaron & filijs ſuis. That is, God hath deliuered to Aaron and his ſonnes, the Leuites, whome he tooke in liewe of the firſt borne. And after more plainely: Et dicitur quòd tradidit ijs dono, id eſt, donando, quia deus impoſuerat onus totius miniſterij ſuper Aaron & filios eius. Cum enim dedit ijs Leuitas vt adiuuarent ipſos, dicobatur dono dare. And it is ſaid that he gaue them for a gift, that is, by way of gift, becauſe God laide the burden of the whole miniſterie vpon Aaron and his ſonnes. For when hee gaue them the Leuites to helpe them, he is ſaid to giue them for a gift. So againe, [De medio populi, from the midſt of the people,] id eſt, dedit Leuitas Aaroni, educendo cos de medio populi, quaſi

dicat; Priùs erant Leuitae, ſicut populares, non habentes aliquam ſpecialem dei miniſtrationem. Poſteà cùm deus fecit illos eſſe ſuos ministros, dicitur ſeparâſſe illos de medio populi, id eſt, ab alijs popularibus diſtinguendo eos, in diuerſitate miniſtrationis ijs traditae, quam non habebant alij Iſraelitae. That is, Hee gaue the Leuites to Aaron, by bringing them forth from the midſt of the people. As who would ſay: Before the Leuites were as the common people, not hauing any ſpeciall ſeruice of God [inioyned them.] Afterward when God made them to be his miniſters, he is ſaid to haue ſeparated them from the middeſt of the people, that is, by diſtinguiſhing them from other of the popular ſort, in the diuerſitie of the miniſtration committed to them, which the other Iſraelites had not. Againe, [Ʋt ſeruiant mihi pro Iſrael, that they may ſerue me for Iſrael] id eſt, vt ſeruiant loco primogenitorum Iſrael, &c. That is, That they may ſerue me in liewe of the firſt borne of Iſrael, &c. And indeed theſe words ſhew as much as was ſaid before, that, Tradidi dono, was only for ſeruice. Now heare Lyra. [Statues Leuitas in conſpectu Aaron, & filiorum eius, & conſecrabis oblatos Domino, ac ſeparabis de medio filiorum Iſrael, vt ſint mei. Thou ſhalt ſet the Leuites in the ſight of Aaron, and of his ſonnes, and ſhalt conſecrate them, hauing offred them to the Lord, and ſhalt ſeparate them from the midſt of the children of Iſrael, that they may be mine.] Hic ſubditur ratio dicti mandati. Ad hoc enim de mandato Domini ordinabantur, vt ſeruirent ſacerdotibus in cultu diuino, quia cultus ante legem datam pertinebat ad primogenitos Iſrael. Sed quòd illi facti ſunt inepti ad cultum dei, ideò Dominus loco illorum, voluit Leuitas ordinari ad cultum ſuum. Et hoc eſt quod dicitur [Et tuli Leuitas] deputando mihi pro cunctis primogenitis filiorum Iſrael. That is: Here the reaſon of the aforeſaid commandement is ſet downe. For to that end were they ordained according to Gods commandement, that they might ſerue his Prieſts in diuine worſhip, which worſhip before the giuing of the Law belonged to the firſt borne of the children of Iſrael. But becauſe

they became vnfit for Gods worſhip, therefore the Lord would haue the Leuites to be ordained for his worſhip in ſtead of them. And this is that which is ſaid [And I tooke the Leuites] deputing them to me for all the firſt borne of the children of Iſrael. To conclude, the Chaldee Paraphraſt thus expounds the text, of gift for ſeruice, not, for exemption, which men ſee none, in theſe words, that ſo bewitch you, except they are Ieſuited. Offeret Aaron Leuitas munus in conſpectu Domini à filijs Iſrael, VT SERVIANT IN MINISTERIO EIVS. That is: Aaron ſhall offer the Leuites for a gift before the Lord from the children of Iſrael, THAT THEY MAY SERVE IN HIS MINISTERIE. But ſo much, and too much, hereof be ſaid. Sauing that not to F. T. this, whoſe argument deſerues it not, but to others from whome he filcht it, that ſtand much vpon it.

Yea becauſe the Biſhop inſiſts more then once vpon Moſes law, and the precedents of the old: Teſtament, to ſhew that primacie belongs to Kings, therefore he is a Iew rather then a Chriſtian, &c. So that now obedience is become among the ceremonies, and the honouring of our parents, that is, in truth of our Princes, Patres patriae by auncient ſtyle, (and ſo Ezechias call'd the Prieſts his children, filij mei, 2. Chron. 29. 11.) is as ſubiect to alteration as the Sabbath day.

So, as our

Sauiour ſaid once about circumciſion, Non ex Moſe, ſed ex Patribus, in like ſort here. It is neither ceremonie, nor iudiciall, neither from 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , nor

And if it be lawfull as you tell vs to argue from the old Teſtament to the newe, by way of ſigne to the thing ſignified, we haue enough in that kind to maintain our aſſertion, though wee had no other argument. For who found a type in Nabuchodonoſor euen now, firſt fierce againſt Daniel, and Daniels God, afterward making lawes as zealouſly in his behalfe? The ouen that was heated to conſume the three children, conſumed their aduerſaries. And ſo Daniels Lyons prepared againſt him, deuoured his accuſers. Theſe are types, if you beleeue S. Auſten, of heathen Emperours turning Chriſtian, and countenancing religion with all their might, as before they vſed the aduantage of their place, onely to ſuppreſſe it and deſtroy it. I might tell you of other types, that haue gone before in the old teſtament, touching the ſupremacie of Kings, appertaining to the newe. As Abrahams harneſſing 318. houſhold ſeruants againſt Kedar-Laomer for the redeeming of Lot; which is a type of Conſtantine (ſay the Fathers of a certain Chalcedon. in Actis. Councell) managing and muſtering iuſt ſo many Biſhops in the Nicene Synode, to the confuſion of Arius. The lyon that ſlew the tranſgreſſing Prophet, is a figure of Leo the Chriſtian Emperour ſuppreſſing hereſies, &c. as Varadatus, 
                  Ibid. in Actis. whome they call excellentiſſimus Monachus, in his Epiſtle to Leo aforeſaid, conſtrues it. In a word, though you be impudent, and your fore-head full of blaſphemies; yet mee thinks you ſhould bee aſhamed to bewray your ſelues ſo much, as to affirme that Kings loſt any part of their ſtroke, by our Sauiours appearing in the new Teſtament, as needs Herods panick feare, Non eripit mortalia, qui regna dat coeleſtia. Sedul. they muſt, if the authoritie was but ceremoniall, or iudiciall either, which they exerciſed before. And therefore I ſpare from further confutation.
               §. 39. As for that the Emperours in the new Teſtament

were heathen, and ſo neither by Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles obeyed, I hope, Sir, it is enough they were not reſiſted.

Though our Sauiour and his Apoſtles did no more turne away frō the edicts of Princes cōcerning relligion, then from the Scribe and the Phariſee, and the chaire of Moſes it ſelfe, which you perhaps would haue heard and obeyed in all things. Will you ſay therefore that the chaire was not ſupreame in thoſe matters? To omit, that if Princes had been neuer ſo impious for the time preſent, yet

As if the Biſhop could not diſcerne the difference of their feedings, vnleſſe you taught him. But, Sir, thus it is. For ſo much as you Ieſuits would picke a Vrbanus 7. may ſeeme to haue been of another mind, whoſe chiefe care, after he came to be Pope, was to prouide victualls good ſtore: & his ground was, becauſe he was called to Paſ

And therefore we ſay your argument for the

Popes ſupremacie followes not well from Paſce oues meas. Rather Dauids Paſce giues him ſome intereſt euen in matters of religion, to which Paſce belongs after a ſpecial ſort, as it is vſed in Scriptures, and Peter is bidde to feed, rather then to rule, to ſhew his authority is not temporall, nor coactiue, but of a milder kind. That you ſay Cyrus was no head of Gods Church, though ſtyled Paſtor, and Paſtor meus, by Gods owne mouth, how do you prooue it? No member Head of the Church is ſaid in a threefold reſpect. 1 2 3 you ſay, therefore no head. But this Eudoemon will help you to vnriddle. Though neither hee was ingrafted into the bodie myſticall, nor yet linked in the bond of outward profeſſion, yet a head he might bee of Gods people by a certaine deputation or aſſignement outward, that is, by bearing authority ouer the multitude of ſubiects, committed to his charge, of what relligion ſoeuer, which is the onely headſhippe that we attribute to Kings. I haue read Theodor. de eurand. Graec. affect. Chemnic. in locis com. part 2. de Paupert. Eſpenc in c. 3. Ep. ad Titum opponit eum impio. Quaſi reputet pium. Et, Diuinitùs ſeruatum diſcimus.

Who knowes what the reading of that propheſie might preuaile vpon him, Eſa. 44. (as Ioſephus witneſſes in the 11. of his Antiq. cap. 1. quoted by S. Hierome vpon Eſa. 45.) wherein he was called by his name Multo antequā naſcereris. Hieron. Annis 210. ante impletam prophetiam. Eſpenc.

               § 41. Whereas the Biſhop in like ſort had inſtanced from Ioſhua, Numb. 27. whome God called to feed his people after Moſes, one temporall magiſtrate after another, leaſt they ſhould be as ſheep which haue no ſhepheard, he anſwers that Ioſua was to be directed by the high Prieſt, not è contrà. As if direction were not one thing, and commaundement another. For the Prieſt may direct, though the King command. And we ſpeake of authoritie now, not of abilitie to counſell. Though Dauid is ſo little affixed to the Prieſts, that he ſayes, Gods ſtatutes are the men of his counſell,
                  
that is, his priuie counſellors. The Common-wealth no doubt is happie, where Heman the Kings Seer is admitted neere vnto him, vt exaltet cornu, 1. Chron. 25. or Benaiah placed ad auriculam Dauid, 2. Chron. 11. I meane where Biſhops are of the conſultation of eſtate. In multitudine boum 
                  Prov. 14. 4. 
                  implentur praeſepia, and where ſuch labourers are, all goes well. But yet Eleazar ſhall onely runne betweene Ioſua and the Lord, while we neither denie the Lord to be ſupreme, nor yet ſuffer the meſſenger to turne the Kings maſter. To the place quoted out of Theodoret. quaeſt. 48. in lib. Num. that Moſes diuided his double glorie betweene Ioſua and Eleazar, as giuing his ſupremacie in ſpirituals to one, in temporals to another, as the Adioynder would haue it: we finde no ſuch thing in the Scripture it ſelfe, Num. 27. but only that God appointed Moſes, to giue Ioſua of his glory, ver. 20. without naming Eleazar. And Theodoret meanes no more, but that Moſes gaue of his Propheſie to Eleazar, which was aureola gloriae, as your Schoolemen would call it, or an additament to the maine, not any branch of dignitie, or of authoritie. His words are, Ex rationali iudicij humeris Eleazari adiacente, diſcat Ioſua quid ſit agendum: Let Ioſua learne what to doe from the Iudgement plate that reſts vpon Eleazars ſhoulders. A great prerogatiue, beleeue me, and to top Kings. Is it not rather to waite vpon them, and to ſerue their vſes? Laſtly thus, Ex quo diſcimus quomodo qui à ſacerdotibus ordinantur, gratiam conſequuntur ſpiritualem: that is, Whereby we learne, how, they that are ordained of Prieſts, attaine ſpirituall grace. We call not the Kings primacie ſpirituall, howſoeuer it extends to ſpirituall matters: though you imputing ſuch a thing vnto vs, as you doe afterwards, you may ſee what a hint Theodoret giues vs here, if we liſt to vſe it. And before, he had told vs, that Ioſua was conſecrated by impoſition of hands. Does not that ſauour of ſomewhat ſpirituall? And how does Moſes pray here, when he praies for a man to be ſet ouer the Congregation, namely Ioſua? Lord God of the ſpirits of all fleſh. As if

ſpirit and fleſh, temporall and Eccleſiaſticall, were the gouernours charge. And ſtraight after, ver. 18. God ſaies to Moſes, Take Ioſua, in whome is the ſpirit. So Platina in the life of Clement the ſeauenth, Corona & caeremoniae, per quas inauguratur Imperator, teſtimonium ſunt diuini ſpiritus accepti: The crowne and the ceremonies, ſaies he, whereby the Emperour is inſtalled, are a token of the diuine ſpirit receiued. And he addes, Qui animum Imperatoris iam auguſtum, auguſtiorem diuiniorem

                      reddat: Which makes the Emperours mind, alreadie royall of it ſelfe, more royall and more diuine. Was not Saul changed into another man, vpon his attaining the kingdome? And how, but by, the grace which he receiued in his inauguration? Salmeron your fellow-Ieſuit, but too learned I feare to be your fellow throughout, Tom. 12. in Ep. Pauli. p. 251. ſaies, Kingdomes themſelues turne ſpirituall, in a manner, vnder Chriſtian Kings. The ſame ſaies Roſſaeus, with more ſtore of words, Sacrum, Eccleſiaſticum, ſpirituale, ſacerdotale, pag. De iuſtā Eccleſiae author. 526. I might giue you more, but this ſhall ſuffice in this place.
               § 42. THE third exception (ſaies he) that the Biſhop 
                  3. Num 20. Adioynd. takes to the argument, drawne from Paſce oues meas, is this: That albeit S. Auſten, and S. Cyrill, haue amply commented vpon the Goſpel of S. Iohn, and vpon thoſe very words of our Sauiour to S. Peter, Paſce oues meas, yet neither of them ſaw, illuſtrem hunc fidei articulum, de prematu Petri temporali, This notable (as he conſtrues it) article of faith, concerning the temporall primacie of Peter, &c. What ſaies Father Thomas to this? For ſome thinke F. T. to haue that myſticall ſignification, to note vnto vs his Fatherhood, which euery hedge-prieſt and beardleſſe boy vſurps now a daies among the Ieſuits, to beard Biſhops with, and what Biſhops? As if the Cardinall (ſaies he) did teach that S. Peters primucie is a tēporall primacie, becauſe in ſome caſes it extends it ſelf to temporall matters. As for the ſpirituall primacie (ſaies he) the Biſhop himſelfe grants that ſometimes, as far forth in effect as

we demand. What the Biſhop graunts, we ſhall ſee hereafter, when we come to the place, which is Chap. 3. num. 36. as we are told by you. In the meane time, you recken without your hoſt, the Biſhop graunts nothing that he will not ſtand to. Be you but content with that which he pitches, and the controuerſie will ſoone be at an ende. But did you euer heare ſuch an impudent varlet, that plaies vpon the word temporall primacie, and denies they giue any ſuch to the Pope? What is their primacie, but a primacie of power? and if the power then be temporall, is not the primacie ſo? Now for that, let but Bellarmine declare his opinion, who intitles his 5. booke de Pontif. Rom. De poteſtate Pontificis temporali: Of the temporall power of the Pope. This is plaine, but in the argument of the ſixt chapter of the ſame booke, more plainly, Papam habere temporalem poteſtatem indirectè: That the Pope hath temporall power, [at leaſt] indirectly. Whereas we neither aſcribe to the King ſpirituall primacie ouerhaſtily, nor are wont to call his power ſpirituall. If the Biſhop haue ſo done, let the place be named, and the imputation verified, wherewith F. T. chargeth vs, Num. 15. though very wrongfully, as if we nouriſhed a doctrine of the Kings ſpirituall primacie. Yet they ſay, Sixtus Quintus would haue had thoſe works of Bellarmine to be burnt, perhaps for giuing him temporall power onely, and not temporall primacy, totidem verbis. 
                  Adioyn. Num. 21. If the Pope's primacie may be called a temporall primacie for this cauſe, &c. then may the Biſhop or Paſtor be iuſtly called a corporall B ſhop, and a pecuniarie Paſtor, becauſe he doth puniſh men ſometimes in his ſpirituall court, not only in their bodies, but alſo in their purſes, &c. And here our lepus pulpamentum quaerit, a wretch and moſt obnoxious to all manner of ſcorne, flouriſhes and deſcants with his leaden wit, vpon a corporall Biſhop, as he calls him, Bonner I trow, who excuſed his corpulencie, wherewith hee was wont to be painted, with ſaying he had but one doublet too little for him, and the knaue hereticks alway painted him in that. If you talke of a puniſher of bodies, he was one. We doe not know, God be thanked, that our Biſhops haue any ſuch power in theſe daies, by the examples we ſee, but that you tell vs ſo. And there was a time, when your Popes themſelues could inflict no puniſhments of this nature, ſaies Papirius Maſſonius in

the life of Leo the ſecond. Now all their ſtrength ſtands that way. And ſo I might ſay of the puniſhing of the purſe, and the gaines of the Biſhops court, which you ſo enuie, wheras not onely he is not forward to deale puniſhments, and much leſſe to gain by the parties puniſhed, but I haue heard his Chancellour, whom certenly you meant when you taxed the Courts, vtterly diſanow, that their Courts condemne any body in mony, howſoeuer offending. How beit if Kings, to whome all the power of the ſword is cōmitted, that is all kind of coactiue puniſhment, ſhould giue the Biſhops leaue to mulct the purſe, rather then their cenſures ſhould be contē
                  ned, what is that to the Popes either exerciſing or challenging to himſelf, I know not what tēporal power, by vertue of his Apoſtleſhip, and originall calling, without donation or delegation from Princes? Though againe if this be graunted, which I beleeue not as yet, becauſe I haue beene otherwiſe informed, as I ſaid, that the Biſhops are ſo licenſed by authoritie from his MAIESTIE here in England, yet the Biſhop whome you ſhoot at, is ſo farre from delighting in any ſuch markets, that he had rather redeeme offences with his loſſe, then raiſe profit to himſelfe out of puniſhments.

How much more when it is ioyned with conſcience and clemencie? Which is ſo proper to the Prelate of whome we ſpeake, as you may wonder: both his Office and Sea ſauouring of

thinke that becauſe he handled Tortus ſomewhat roughly, or the Cardinall either, therefore he is more vindicatiue out of his diſpoſition. But for that you may remember, that he was the Kings Almoner, and dealt his liberalities as they had beene beſt deſerued.
               Now leauing the digreſſion that this mans malepertnes hath driuen vs vnto, what ſaies he for ſubſtance to the Biſhops third exception, as himſelfe branches it?
               § 43. IT is enough (ſaies he) that Cyrill and Auſten denie 
                  Num. 21. 
                  not the temporall power of Peter, though they auerre it not, in their commentaries. Forſooth they expound not Paſce halfe perfectly, wherein ſurely they are to blame, in ſo large a Commentarie, as few haue written vpon that Scripture, to ſay nothing of a thing ſo materiall as that, or ſo principall rather, and yet ſo obuious, when the text lies naked before their eyes. For it is a neceſſarie conſequent, the temporall power (ſaies our Ieſuit here) of the ſpirituall. Which yet Mr. Epiſt. ad Cardinal. Bellarm.

Beſides, he ſhould haue ſhewed the neceſſarie conſequence betweene the two powers, which becauſe he does not, I thinke he either ſaw it not, or lacked abilitie to expreſſe his minde. Me thinkes nothing eaſier then to conceiue ſo of them, that though linked in vſe, yet diuided in nature, and ſo likewiſe in ſubiect, as Gelaſius gaue caution De vinc. Anathem. long agoe very well, of not confounding them, like the two armes in a mans bodie, or the two lights in the firmament, (ſo farre I am content to goe with Bonifacius) yea or the two ſwords themſelues, ecce duo gladij, whereof one queſtionleſſe depended not of another, though your expoſition be ſo good, that Stella is aſhamed of it, and diuerſe Comment. in Luc 22. more of your owne men.
               § 44. That S. Auſten acknowledged the Popes temporall

primacie, implyed in thoſe words, Paſce oues meas, you bring no other places then we haue hitherto anſwered, and it might be thought too largely, but that you bring them againe, as primus Apoſtolorum, and propter primatum Apoſtolatús, of which no more. Let them preuaile as they can. So likewiſe I ſay of repreſentare perſonam, which you inforce here againe to be ſupreame gouernour ouer the Church. This is your riches, that runne round in a ring, and choake the children of the Prophets with your crambe, and yet cry out of the Biſhop for his nakedneſſe and pouertie in proouing the cauſe, Numb. 15. As for that you here adde, that no other Apoſtle is ſaid to repreſent the Churches perſon beſides Peter, S. Auſten hath made you to ſwallow it before; yet peruſing your booke, I find it to be no more then your ſelfe attribute to Mr. Thomas Rogers, of whome you ſay in your ninth chapter, Num. 78. that he repreſents the authoritie of all the Clergie of England: not only the Clergie, but the authoritie of them all; and yet I thinke you neuer held him for our ſupreame gouernour. To that of S. Cyrill, Vt Princeps caput

                      caeterorum primus exclamauit: I wonder firſt, why you ſhould conſtrue it exclaimed, vnleſſe your argument ſtand in that, as if Peter ſhould get the primacie by roaring. So hee in Plutarch, when he ſaw a tall man come in to try maſteries, but otherwiſe vnweildy, This were a likely man, ſaies he, if the garland hung aloft, & he that could reach it with his hands, were to haue it for his paines. You know that we Engliſhmen call that exclaiming, when a man cries out by diſcontent, or paſſion. Was Peter offended, when you make him to exclaime? As for princeps & caput, it is waighed in the ballance, and found too light. S. Ierome, Dial. 1. contra Pelag. Ʋt Plato princeps Philoſophorum, it a Petrus Apoſtolorum: as Plato was cheife among the Philoſophers, ſo Peter of the Apoſtles. Doth that pleaſe you? For Plato though he liued in Dionyſius his Court, yet he was no Monarch. No more was Peter.

Who knowes not that S. Iames was called Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum, as Nilus teſtifies? yet S. Ambroſe ſerm. 83. giues that to Chriſt, to be Epiſcopus Epiſcoporū, as his priuiledge. Though Sidonius, an author not iuſtly to be excepted againſt, affirmes Lib 6. Ep. 1. no leſſe of one Lupus a particular Biſhop, that he was Epiſcopus Epiſcoporū, & Pater Patrum, & alter ſaeculi ſui Iacobus: that is, a Biſhop of Biſhops, and a Father of Fathers, & another Iames [the Apoſtle] of his age. Which in the end wil proue as much as caput caeterorum, though you bring that to magnifie Peter by. As if caput caeterorū, might not be one ſet vp by ſpeciall prouiſo, to keepe good order in the Colledge, I meane the Colledge of the Apoſtles, though without any commiſſion to deriue it to his ſucceſſors, or extrauagant power ouer the reſt for the preſent. Laſtly, I might aske you, how Peter could be caput caeterorum here, that is, Monarch

inſtalled in your ſenſe, when you tell vs a little after, Num. 31. out of S. Chryſoſtome, that Peter durſt not aske our Sauiour the queſtion, who ſhould betray him, till ſuch time as he had receiued the fulnes of authoritie, and after that time he grew confident. Which time was not till after our Sauiours reſurrection, and therefore farre from this. So if you truſt to Chryſoſtome, you haue loſt Cyrill, if to Cyrill, Chryſoſtome; you cannot poſſibly hold them both, if you vrge caput in ſo rigorous ſenſe. I might adde out of S. Cyrill once againe, to ſtop your mouth, crying out ſo mainely Hilat. can. 30. in Matth. Petrus pro fidei ſuae calore,—Quaſi Chriſts dicta efficienda non eſſent. So

                     oate that he thought Chriſt might be in the wrong, himſelfe in the right. againſt lame quotations, that princeps as it may be taken, is expounded there by ferventiſſimus Apoſtolorum, ſo feruent ſaith S. Cyrill, that hee leapt naked into the ſea, out of the ſhip, for zeale. Where if the ſhip be the Church, then wee haue Peter leaping out of the Church. You will ſay perhaps, from Antioch to Rome. Then Antioch is the ſhip, and Rome the ſea. What vantage haue you now of all that is ſaid of Peters ſhip to countenance Rome? Doe you ſee how one iumpe hath marred your allegorie, and almoſt your Monarchie? Now S. Cyrill ſaies farther in the place you quote, lib. 12. cap. 64. in Ioh. Petrus alios praeveniebat, how? Ardore nam

                  Petrus alios praevenicbat. 
                  Chriſti praecipuo feruens, & ad faciendum & ad respondendum paratiſſimus erat. That is: Peter preuented others. For boyling Petrus feruens ardore. with an eſpeciall zeale to our Sauiour Chriſt, he was moſt readie and forward, either to doe, or ſay. This was the cauſe why he exclaimed firſt. Primus, ſaies S. Cyrill, but not ſolus. Hic Malchi etiam aurem amputauit (that you cannot abide to heare of) putans hoc modo Magiſtro ſemper ſe inhaeſurum. So little did he couet the primacie that you ſtriue for, that he wiſht neuer to be abſent from his Maſter, which if he had not beene, he could neuer haue ruled in his roome. Then, in euery confeſſion that he made (ſaies S. Cyrill) rationalium ouium curam ſibi habendam eſſe audiuit. Is cura nothing? which with you praefectura hath cleane deuoured. And if you but remembred, that they were oues rationales, you would tyrannize leſſe, and ſtand leſſe for tyrannie. There

There are other things betweene, which I paſſe ouer here, becauſe you ſhall heare them anon. Take this for farwell. Doctores hinc Eccleſiae diſcunt (ſaith S. Cyrill) non aliter ſe Chriſto poſſe coniungi, niſi omni curâ & operâ ſtudeant, vt rationales oues rectè paſcantur, & rectè valeant. Talis erat Paulus ille, &c. That is: The Doctors of the Church learne from hence, that they can no otherwiſe be ioyned vnto Chriſt, vnleſſe they endeauour with all their paine and diligence, that his reaſonable ſheepe be well fed, and well liking. Such a one was Paul, &c. By which you ſee what a ſenſe he giues vs of Paſce, of feeding Chriſts ſheepe, namely with labour and diligence, which the Pope cannot skill of, and Paul (not onely Peter) a prime inſtance of it. Neither doubt I, but when Paul ſaies of himſelfe, I haue laboured more then they all, S. Cyrill would conſtrue it, according to this rule, I haue fedde more then they all.

The one, for that they ſaw more then ſo, namely the primacie of Peter, As I haue ſhewed (ſay you) out of them both: and, I thinke, we haue anſwered you, to them both. The other, becauſe they ſaw not that, which he affirmeth in their behalfe: I meane (ſay you) that S. Peter was, by thoſe words of our Sauiour, reſtored to his place in the Apostleſhip, which he had loſt. For if they ſhould haue ſaid ſo, they ſhould ſeeme to hold (or fauour at leaſt) the pernitious hereſie of Wickliffe,

that Magiſtrates looſe their dignitie and authoritie by mortall ſinne; which peſtiferous opinion, thoſe holy Fathers, no doubt, would haue abhorred, if it had beene ſet abroach, or taught by any in their time: ſeeing that it ſhaketh the very foundation of all obedience, either to Ciuill, or Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrates, becauſe it does not onely make all obedience vncertaine (for no man knowes who is in the ſtate of grace) but alſo giueth occaſion to ſubiects, vpon euery offence of their Prince, to cal his authority into queſtion. This is the circumſtance of this tedious Thom. But that Wickliffe was in this hereſie, you muſt bring better proofes before wee beleeue it, it is long ſince that your words are no ſlaunders. The damnable enormities vſed in thoſe times, your very houre and power of darkeneſſe, might driue ſome to opinion, that the office ceaſed when the Officer was incorrigible, becauſe they ſaw no other remedie. But this, as I beleeue not to haue beene Wickliffes iudgement, till you ſhewe better euidence, ſo whoſe-ſoeuer it was, you haue rather followed him in your Ieſuiticall principles, that, the mightie are to be pul'd downe from their ſeats by you, though Marie and Anna make it Gods proper worke, Luk. 2. and 1. Sam. 2. one the pearle of the new, the other of the old Teſtament, then that we ſhould feare to be enwrapped in his danger.

Neither are we ſlacke to ſubſcribe to Optatus, lib. 2. cont. Parm. Deus defendit oleum ſuum, quia ſi peccatum eſt hominis, vnctio tamen eſt diuinitatis. God protects his oyle, becauſe though the ſinne be the mans, yet the annointing is his owne. And not onely Princes, but by iuſt iudgement of God, in lieu of your other error, you turne out

your very Popes for hereſie; Canus, and Bellarmine, and ſome other hold ſo, that he is gone ipſo facto: we yeilding to no ſuch abdication of our King, no though his fault were hereſie, remembring that Deus defendit oleum ſuum, as euen now I told you out of Optatus: and, Caeſar non deſinit eſſe Caeſar, euen in alto gentiliſmo, as our Sauiour acknowledged of him, Matth. 22. Inſomuch as Dauid ſeemes to wonder, 2. Sam. 1. that Saul could die at all, becauſe he was annointed with oyle. He was ſlaine (ſaith he) as if he had not been annointed. Qui propter ingenium videbatur omninò mori non debuiſſe, quoth Tullie of Roſcius. Nor he, propter imperij Maieſtatem. Therefore the wickednes lies on your ſide, whatſoeuer Wickliffe thought, whome you ſlaunder. But ſo hainous is the hereſie of depoſing Magiſtrates for morall miſdemeanours, that they are iuſtly ſcourged, euen with your owne whip.

                  Bellarmine vnawares betraies his cauſe in my opinion, taking pro conceſſo, that the Steward of a houſe, cannot be depoſed from his office, but onely by the grand maſter of the familie, which he conſtrues to be Chriſt, by analogie, in the ſtate. What can be ſaide more for his MAIESTIES ſecuritie that now is, (ſetting aſide his princely vertues, which might arme him againſt all triall) and that out of the mouth of the very old-one, his aduerſarie? Though the holy Ghoſt in Eſay calls all Kings by that name, deſigning them Stewards, not onely of the ſtate and weale publick, but of the Church it ſelfe, Erunt Reges dispenſatores tui. As euen your owne Forerius, 
                  Eſa 49. and he a learned Portaguiſe, expounds it in his commentaries vpon that place, deducing it from the Rabbins. (To ſay nothing of the claime that Kings might make to Diſpenſations henceforth, which now the Pope only in groſſeth.) But his MAIESTIES cauſe is yet more pregnant then ſo, in whoſe name, not onely in his perſon, God and nature haue engraued this character, not onely in femore, but in veſtimento,
                  
as it were to marke him out for ſacred, againſt your furious deſignes.
               § 46. By the way I might aske you, what you meane by that, that no man knowes who is in the ſtate of grace? Does that confute Wicliffe, or them that hold Magiſtrates are no longer Magiſtrates, after mortall ſinnes? As if a man could not be out of the ſtate of grace, & yet not all his actions be mortall ſinnes. Such a babe you are in your owne doctrines.
               § 47. And if the Biſhop ſhould hold this, which you impute vnto him, hote iudges of his holdings, that make him a Polygamiſt, a Iew, as of late, and now a broacher forſooth of treaſonable poſitions, yet with what face can you cry out againſt him as you doe, num. 28. Why ſhould Peter rather then any other looſe his Apoſtleſhip? ſeeing your ſelues are forwardeſt to cenſure your Pope with depriuation, ipſo facto, whereas another Biſhop, I ſuppoſe, may come to his tryall. Is this that which the Pope gets by, A nemine iudicabitur? Vnleſſe the crime were ſmal to denie Chriſt, whom he had ſeene and conuerſed with ſo familiarly, which Optatus ſo exaggerates againſt S. Peter, lib. 7. as if he had no fellowe, Quiſquis in perſecutione negauit Chriſtum, (imagine Marcellinus, or the like) leuiùs Petro deliquiſſe videtur. The ſinne of denying Chriſt in perſecution, ſeemes leſſe then. Peters: or as if any religion can be maintained there, where the ſonne of God is abiured and caſt off, and therfore once no hereſie more pernicious then this.
               § 48. But now what if the Biſhop do not hold that Peter loſt his Apoſtleſhip? or, what if hee doe? Shall it not bee lawfull for our Sauiour Chriſt to put out his Apoſtle, (Abi Satan, that is, Get thee gone, ſaith the Arabian tranſlator, 
                  Kirſten. Not. Matth. 16. not, Recede, depart, or goe aſide a while) and yet take him in againe, for ſo enormious a crime, but euery varlet and raſcall companion ſhall preſume to do the ſame againſt his Soueraigne, and ſawcily ſhake off his Superiours at pleaſure? And yet theſe are the ſeedes of that good diſcipline which here you ſowe, and you thinke S. Peters caſe is ā confirmation

of treaſon, as if hee could not looſe his office by cenſure from our Sauiour, but ſubiects may lay down their fealtie to Magiſtrates, when they fall into offence. Or, doe you thinke that no Apoſtle could looſe his place? If you do, you may read S. Hierome ad Ruſticum, affirming of Iudas, that he fell de faſtigio Apoſtolatûs, &c. to a place vnrecouerable. Wherein our Sauiour dealt more mildly with Peter, whom he tooke in againe. Curans verbis, quod verbis offenſum erat, ſaith S. Cyrill: healing with words, his fault of words, that is, triple negation by proportionable confeſſion. And remember you not what the holy Ghoſt ſaith of Iudas, Epiſcopatum cius accipiat alter? which was not practiſed againſt S. Peter, our Lord dealing graciouſly with him, as I ſaid, as if he had ſuſpended him, not depriued him. But for my part, I take not vpon me to define this queſtion; and the Biſhop, as moſt able, ſo I dare ſay was farther of from medling with it. He lookes not to by-matters, but when dignus vindice nodus offers it ſelfe, then he lendes a hand; whereas you patch, and pelt, and clowt euery thing into euery place that you can, like a beggers coate, or a Sturbridge-faire booth, or a cypreſſe tree in the midſt of the ſea. The Biſhops purpoſe was onely to ſignifie in S. Cyrils words, that dignitas Apoſtolatûs renouata eſt S. Petro, that the honour of the Apoſtleſhip was renewed to S. Peter. Fatemur (ſaies he) as aſſenting to S. Cyrill, not iangling nor determining, as you would haue it. And I pray Sir, how does that differ from S. Cyrils own words, which you traduce in the Biſhop, ne propter negationem labefactata videretur? Concuſſa therefore it was, ſhaken and enfeebled, but not vtterly daſht nor vndermin'd. And where you prattle not a little, a little before, But perhaps ſome will ſay, that the Biſhop does not plainely affirme this, but relateth the doctrine of S. Auſten and S. Cyrill, which you infringe by thoſe words, that you bring out of the Biſhop, reſtitutus muneri, reſtored to his charge, as if therefore he had loſt it in the Biſhops opinion: what more is in reſtitution, then was afore in renouation? And if the Apoſtleſhip be renouatus,
                  
how is not the Apoſtle reſtitutus? If S. Cyrill be right, how is the Biſhop wrong? May I not truely aske, what does this dog lacke but a bone? And yet ſoone after, hee can giue the Biſhop that tearme, and another too with vantage. Verbum in corde ſtulti, ſicut ſagitta in femore canis. But the crown of reuerence is thicke ſet with ſuch precious ſtones. Neither does onely Cyrill ſay as much, but Euthymius vſeth the very word reſtitutus. Conuerſus, (ſaies he) id eſt, in priſtinum locum denuò reſtitutus. See Chryſoſt. Hom. 2. in Pſal. 50. where he ſaies no leſſe: that he loſt his Apoſtleſhip by denying, and recouered it by repenting and confeſſing. Theophyl. in Luc. 22. Cum negaueris, iterum

                      receperis, viz. Apoſtolatum, of which before. He recouered his Apoſtleſhip, ergo he loſt it. Arnobius alſo in Pſal. 138. Maior gradus redditur ploranti, quàm ſublatus eſt deneganti. A greater degree is reſtored to him weeping, then was taken from him denying. Therefore doubtleſſe his deniall depriued him of ſome degree. Victor Antiochenus, Denuò aſſumptus, & inter caeteros Apoſtolos rurſus numeratus, taken home againe, and reckoned among the Apoſtles. And if S. Auſten ſaid by one, not of the beſt life, Anton. Fuſſul. quoted by F. T.
                   
                  Aut aſſumat obedientiam, aut deponat praedicationem, you may thinke what was fit to be done by Peter here. Quare accipis verba mea in os tuum? ſaid God to the vngodly. Cùm vidiſti ancillam, eiurabas me apud eam: for euen the falling of thoſe drops, made a hole into our rocke. What maruell if the Fathers put Peter beſide the Apoſtleſhip for his greiuous

May he be an Apoſtle, nay the Prince of the Apoſtles, in your opinion, that is no member of the Church? Indeed Bellarmine conſtrues thoſe words of hereſie. But firſt fondly, and without any ground, then Peters is no leſſe, if it come to be weighed, as we haue ſhewed out of Optatus.
               
               § 49. As for the proofes that you bring in defence of Peter, how eaſily might he looſe his Apoſtleſhip for all them, if a man were diſpoſed to enter into argument? Cyrill of Ieruſalem, Catech. Myſtag. 2. is brought ſaying, Petrus dignitatem

Apoſtolicam retinuit non ablatam: that is, finally, and retinuit ex intervallo, that is, recuperauit: non ablatam, and yet ſuſpenſam. In the Greeke thus, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , not that he kept it without euer looſing, but rather that the Apoſtleſhip, of it owne nature, is ſuch if nothing hinder. But of that I contend not, neither do you for modeſtie quote the Greeke. The ſame to Optatus, lib. 7. He deſerued not to be ſeparated from the number of the Apoſtles. That is, not finally. Elſe we know, he went out, and wept bitterly. He went out in a myſterie, and perhaps to ſhew his deſerued ſeparation. As when Chriſt lookt vpon him, I graunt ſenſibly, and yet in a myſterie, to ſhew the power of his grace, and irradiation vpon his heart. That Optatus ſaies, bono vnitatis ſeparari non meruit, it is not, leaſt the Diſciples ſhould want a head, and yet there may be a head, only to keep out confuſion, as the Preſident of Councels, and other ordinarie aſſemblies, without any great authoritie ouer the congregation, I wiſſe; but in regard to his patience, which hee Bono vnitatis. had learnt by his owne fal, to ſhew to other offenders. This is bonum vnitatis, this is pax publica, that keepes all in tune. Ne & tu tenteris, Gal. 2. how much more, poſt quam & tentatus, & eliſus es? 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Hebr. 7. Howbeit beſides the Fathers afore-named, Optatus me thinkes is plaine enough, that Peters Apoſtleſhip was not a little endangered. Thus he ſaies, Cui ſatis erat, ſi poſtquam negauit, ſolam veniam conſequeretur. For whom it had been enough, if he had obtained pardon onely, after his denyall. Not the keeping of his place, but pardon onely. Therefore at leaſt he forfeited it. And by the way you ſee, what non meruit 
                  A fooliſh tricke that the Papiſts haue got, to raiſe Engliſh merit out of the Latin mereo and mereos, which ſounds to a far other ſenſe with the holy Fathers, God knowes. is, no more then aſſecutus eſt, I warrant you.
               § 50. Now whereas you come vpon vs in your num. 27. and num. 29. with an ouer-plus of valour, that the Fathers alleadged doe not onely teach in expreſſe words, that S. Peter did not looſe his Apoſtleſhip by his fall, but doe withall acknowledge a certaine increaſe thereof, and preheminent authoritie ouer the reſt of the Apoſtles, what increaſe

could there be, if he was made their Head and gouernour before, and not onely theirs, but the whole worlds? Was it ſo, that more notice was taken thereof? For I ſee not what actuall exaltation could accrew. Therefore, you doe well to expound your ſelfe, by ſaying that he was made more eminent, then before. Yet if you will goe thus farre, Arnobius would teach you to maintaine that which you call increaſe, in a more literall ſenſe. For that which before was promiſed Peter, was now giuen and exhibited, and ſo plus redditum quàm ſublatum, as Arnobius ſpeakes. Yet no more to Peter, then to all the reſt, as Matth. 28. 19. and Ioh. 20. 23. To all as much as to Peter was giuen. Saue onely, as the Biſhop excellently diſtinguiſhes, the res or the ſubſtance to all, the ſolemnitie to Peter, with demand of loue, and triple acknowledgement, Ioh. 21. 15. As for the place out of Matthew, if you compare the coherence, you ſhall ſee if our Sauiour made any Pope, he made more then one without all queſtion. For who is the Pope, but he to whome the power of Christ is communicated? Now he ſaies thus; All power is giuen me, both in heauen and in earth. And what then? 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Goe YOV therefore and teach: not, Goe THOV therefore. This power therefore of Chriſt is communicated to them all, by vertue of this therefore, as much as he thought good to communicate it at all. Either many Popes then, that you muſt giue vs, or we you none. This by the way. That Cyrill of Ieruſalem calls Peter, princeps Apoſtolorum excellontiſſimus, I haue anſwered you before to the word princeps, in Cyrill of Alexandria, a man of more authoritie, then he of Ieruſalem, (as one Sea exceedes the t'other) who writ what hee writ, when he was yong, ſaies S. Hierome. But the Greeke is otherwiſe, then you quote. Firſt 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, the moſt verticall. Therefore many 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , many vertices, that is, either heads, or crownes of heads, more eminent thē heads. What if Peter among theſe excelled? Euen the Sunne is ſometime more verticall then another, yet he acquires no authoritie among the ſtarres, though more opportunitie to

worke vpon our bodies. So Peter to edifie with the reſt that excelled. But if you ſtand vpon

Does not this confirme all that we haue ſaid before, and ouerthrow you? Onely Peter tooke them, as an inſtance of vnitie, as a pledge of the body, as you haue often heard out of S.

                  Peter receiued the keyes, but Paul was rapt to the third heauen. How could that be, if he had not the keyes? And Clemens in Euſebius before quoted, lib. 2. cap. 1. ſaies generally of the three, that they cōmunicated it to others, what they had heard of Chriſt. Theſe were Peter, Iames, and Iohn. But that was doctrine that Clemens ſpake of; yet the The Word and Keyes, two de▪ poſitums of like nature. like no doubt holds in the Keyes after a ſort, at leaſt de poſſibili, without any diſparagement to the communitie of the Apoſtles.

                  , euen as Paul thought good. For that you bring out of his 2. booke de Sacerdot. you ſhould haue ſpecified the chapter, and we would haue cloſed with you better. In the Greeke I finde nothing but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , of which before out of S. Cyrill, in the very ſuperlatiue

                  . But in the ſame chap. he ſaies (which is the firſt of that booke,) that Chriſt committed his flocke by Paſce oues meas,

                  , to Peter, and them after him. And leaſt you thinke he meanes onely the Popes, he applies it to Euen ſo is that to be taken which Bellar. notes out of Chryſoft in Acta (ſee pag. 15. 
                           〈◊〉
                        ) that the Chriſtians are not to be aſhamed, if they be miſcalled after the name of ſome eminent Paſtor or Prelate of the Church. For he meanes not the Pope there, rather then himſelfe. For firſt, why ſhould Conſtantinople, or Antioch either, gratifie Rome ſo much: conſidering the emulations. 2. Though we ſhould grant Chryſoft to ſpeake by propheſie. 3. But beſides it appeares, that Chryſoſtomes followers were called Iohann

And yet we call not the Papiſts from the name of this or that Pope among them, as Chryſoft. meaning is, but from a generall one to all that occupie the Sca. 5. Which til the Pope ingroſſed it, was yet more generall. himſelfe, not yet ſo much as Biſhop, but onely called to ſingle prieſthood, that he ſhould 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , ſuppoſe you like a Peter,. i. be ſet ouer all the ſubſtance of Gods houſe. And farther he ſaies he is to doe thoſe things, which Peter if he did, ſhould 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . i. goe beyond the reſt of the

Apoſtles. Doe you ſee then how all the prerogatiue of Peter, is built vpon his practiſe, and good deſert; not abſolutely cleauing to him, and his? Nay, no more (ſaies Chryſoſt.) then extends to euery good Paſtor. I might contemne your Latine now, to which nothing is anſwerable in the Greeke. Yet ſuppoſe it were ſo, as you auouch. AVTHORITATE praeditum, ac reliquis item Apoſtolis longè praecellere. Is this arguing for a Ieſuit? Which all put together doth not ſhew ſo much, as that Peter had any authoritie ouer the Apoſtles. Vnleſſe you thinke becauſe he had authoritie, therfore they had none. This were prettie, if you could worke it, but neuer out of Chryſoſtome. And yet longè praecellere, is worſe then ſo, of gifts, of qualities, not of iuriſdiction. And I beleeue, if the truth were knowne, that ſame very 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which I quoted euen now, nothing to their purpoſe. In ſumme, if S. Peter had all the authoritie that Chryſoſt. giues the Prieſt in his book of prieſthood, it would not ſerue the Pope, who is for temporall and coactiue, which Chryſoſt. denies tooth and nayle, cap. 2. 3. &c. of the afore-ſaid. Another place you bring out of Chryſoſt. cap. vlt. in Euang. Ioh. that Peter was the mouth of the Apoſtles. And you might haue added that of Dauid, I will giue praiſe with the beſt member that I haue, meaning the mouth, or the tongue: for els what gaine you by this bargaine? And againe, Awake my glorie, that is my tongue, ſay the Interpreters, becauſe the tongue is the glorie of a man, Pſalm. 56. Caſaubone will ſhew you, and that moſt excellently, that the Exercit. ad Baron. pag. 726. mouth is put in a diminutiue ſenſe, and notes miniſterie, not ſupremacie, office and paines, not authoritie. And ſo we might ſay of the head; which Peter was, as the forwardeſt to reſolue; ad respondendum & faciendum paratiſſimus, ſaies S. Cyrill, as including both. This was his diſpoſition, not his commiſſion. Of late the Pope hath left both the head, and the mouth, and betakes him to the hands. S. Bernard had De conſid ad Eugen. l 4. c 2. Voſſ. edit. challenged him for it long agoe, for liuing by his hands: not as S. Paul and the olde Monkes, which is tedious to you to

heare of, but he meant of bribes, we of forcible and coactiue execution. Brachia mea iudicabunt populos, as if he tooke it Eſa. 51. 15. literally, and to himſelfe. And could you not for a neede, finde in your heart to conſtrue, caput congregationis, after S. Austens meaning, as a figure of generalitie, and repreſenting the whole bodie? What a ſcandall will it be for Ieſuits to encounter ſuch a worke, and of ſo reuerend a Prelate, with no better ſpeares, then one might make of fennell ſtalks, breaking into fitters with the leaſt cruſh, and which if a man ſhould anſwer but as many waies as he might, it would be intolerable?
               § 52. That which followes is as idle, that Chriſt did not vpbraid S. Peter for his ſinne; as if he doth any, Iam. 1. 5. either for grace affoarded, or faults pardoned. That Peter had the care of his brethren committed to him; as if we imagined Peter ſuch a Cain, that cryed, What haue I to looke to my brother? But, he is confident now, that was fearefull afore, to aske

Beſides, great charges make not confident, but carefull rather, and ſolicitous ſurely, as extraordinarie fauours binde to awe, fleſh not in pride, vnleſſe it be fooles. The approoued loue of our Sauiour Chriſt, in receiuing him to grace, and ſetling him in his Apoſtleſhip, or (if you would ſuffer me to ſpeake ſo) in reſtoring him, might adde ſpirit to him, which is S. Chryſoſtomes meaning, not as you conſtrue him. But, alas, what did Peter get by asking that queſtion? What, not ſecret cenſure, but open check, at our Sauiours hands? Quid ad te? what preiudice to his diſcretion, let S. Cyrill ſhew you. But two faults onely, Curioſitie, and Deſire to haue other men partakers of his miſeries. This is the inbred corruption of our nature. Communiter inſitum hominibus (ſaith S. Cyrill) vt optent, ſi quid periculi ſubituri ſint, non ſe eſſe ſolos, ſed caeteros etiam aut videre pati, aut paſſos audire, aut paſſuros eſſe. It is the nature of men, if they be to ſlide into

any daunger, to wiſh not to be alone, but either to ſee others to ſuffer, or to heare of them that haue ſuffered, or that they ſhall, and muſt, at leaſt, ſuffer the ſame. So Peter. Hearing that he muſt ſuffer, he asked whether Iohn ſhould eſcape; or no. As for, Si me amas; fratrum curam ſuſcipe, if cura fratrum be the boundleſſe Monarchie, little neede he wooe Popes to that place, by ſo ſtiffe a coniuration, as Si amas me. Aske Iulius the ſecond, who when his friends were offended with him, Papyr. Maſſ. for offering too largely for the Popedome, he ſaid, None that knew the worth of that place, would ſtick at any gifts, whereby to compaſſe it. Aske Praetextatus the heathen, Make me

                  Pope, ſaies he, and I will be a Christian. Yet, this is your, Si amas me, ſuſcipe curam fratrum. It were infinit to go through all. I will conclude with Mr. Caſaubones moſt worthie obſeruation, that if Peter were the Head and Rector intended, as you imagine, what neede S. Chryſoſtome make the queſtion, Quare Petrum omiſſis caeteris affatur de his rebus? why does our Sauiour conferre with Peter about theſe matters, skipping by the reſt? For euery man might ſee it were the due of his place. And ſo much of S. Chryſostome.
               
               § 53. THE laſt of them whoſe authoritie you alleadge, is S. Leo, your owne Pope, and not a little addicted to the amplyfying of the Phylacteries of his owne ſea, as his MAIESTIE hath told you in his Apology moſt plentifully; but all, as it ſeemes, vpon the deafe ſide. For you will not heare, nor bee charmed. Yet what ſayes Leo? The charge of feeding the ſheepe of Chriſt, was more ſpecially commended to Peter, Ep. 89. A moſt true word. But the Biſhop tels you how, Praeceptum ad omnes, Solennit as ad illum. So Peter more ſpecially receiued the keies: for hee receiued them, ſaies S. Auſten, as the Churches proxey; but communicandas cum omnibus, to bee imparted to all, as Optatus told you but verie lately. But in an other place, Ser. 3. de Aſſump. ad Pontif. what brings he? That Peter was choſen out of the whole world, to haue the cheife charge of the vocation of the Gentiles,

and of all the Apoſtles, and of all the Fathers of the Church. Here is nothing for your turne, ſaue that Peter was choſen to haue the charge of the Apoſtles. But to the calling of the Gentiles, though all helped, yet none might compare with S. Paul, for that matter, who therefore calls himſelfe the Apoſtle of the Gentiles: and leaſt you thinke he gloſes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in faith and veritie, 1. Tim. 2. 7. Neither doe wee denie, that Peter might haue the charge of the Apoſtles, yet no commaunding charge; but either as ferrum acuit ferrum, as Salomon ſaies, one iron whets and ſharpens another, ſo the Prou. 17. 17. face of one brother, to quicken another by his encouragements, Confirma fratres: or, bono vnitatis, preferred for his maturitie, to preuent ſchiſme and diſorder, as hath beene told you. Though the name Apoſtles is common to ſome without the companie of the twelue, and the Scripture vſeth it ſo, Phil. 2. 25. whom Peter might be charged with, and with the other Fathers of the Church, as Leo here calls the Biſhops of their making, without derogating from the Colledge of them, properly ſo called. Therefore heare how S. Leo qualifies this ſaying in the ſame Sermon, a little after. Tranſiuit quidem etiam in alios Apoſtolos vis poteſtatis iſtius, & ad omnes Eccleſiae principes decreti huius inſtitutio commeauit: ſed non fruſtrà vni commendatur, quod omnibus intimatur. It cannot be denyed, but the force of this authoritie paſſed alſo vnto the other Apoſtles, and the ſame ordinance comprehends all the peeres of the Church. But not without cauſe is that deliuered to one, which concernes all. Why ſo? Petro enim ideò hoc ſingulariter creditur, quia cunctis Eccleſiae rectoribus Petri forma proponitur. That is: For therefore is this particularly recommended to Peter, becauſe Peter is made a patterne of all Church-gouernours. And S. Auſten de verbis Domini ſecundum Iohannem, Serm. 49. Dominus in vno Petro format Eccleſiam: Our Lord ſtill faſhions his Church in Peter. Leo ſaies, the gouernours; Auſten, the whole Church, is exemplified in Peter. So that Peter, you ſee, ſtill ſtood for a generall man, and not for a particular; and as S. Auſten
                  
ſaid afore, to commend vnitie: ſo Leo both takes in that, vni commendatur, and giues the reaſon withall, becauſe Peters example was moſt worthy the imitating. Cunctis Petri forma proponitur, and, Eccleſiae rectoribus, to all rulers of the Church, to ſhewe that Peter was not ruler alone. I might oppoſe you with other ſentences in that Sermon, which you could hardly ſalue, that wreſt all ſo violently to your turne: as, Vt cum Petrus multa ſolus acceperit, nihil in quenquam ſine illius participatione tranſierit: yet the Scripture neuer ſayes, that of Peters fulneſſe we haue all receiued. And againe Leo, Nunquum niſi per ipſum dedit, quicquid alijs non negauit. Yet S. Auſten de verb. Dom. ſecundum Matth. Serm. 13. Quod nemo poteſt in Petro, hoc poteſt in Domino. But his MAIESTIE in his Apologie, hauing preuented all that might be alleadged in this kind, your ſilence ſhewes, you haue not what to anſwer. Neither will I therefore trouble my ſelfe with the reſt of your citations, till you haue qualified theſe. Facile eſt Athenienſes laudare Athenis: ſo it was Plato, Menexeno.
                   eaſie for Leo, to rhetoricate at Rome, in the praiſe of Peter. Let vs paſſe, ſay you, to ſome other matter. And let vs ſee, ſay I, if you bring any better.
               § 54. AS for the law in the Code (the next thing in your booke) it is a ſigne you lacke proofes for Popedome: elſe you would neuer bring ſo caſt a law, firſt controuert, and then counterfeit, beſides importing ſo little for your ſide. Yet you ſay, this lawe is brought by you, in your Supplement, to prooue the dutifull respect and obedience of the auncient Emperours to the Romane Sea. The respect we graunt you, as long as it was Catholicke. For what good man would not reſpect both Church and Biſhop Chriſtian? I except not him that weares the diademe, as S. Chryſoſt. ſpeakes in another Hom. 83. in Matth. iterum

as Gregorie, as Agatho, as diuerſe others, often brought you, and often told you, will ſhew it reſts on the Popes ſide. And what if Iuſtinian writing to the Pope, had followed the veine of an Epiſtle ſo far, as to beſmeare him with all the kind tearmes that might bee? All that you bring, is, that the Romane Church is caput Eceleſiarum, which no way derogates from the Emperours authority, nor inioynes him no ſuch durie or obedience as now is vrged, and when all is done, caput is nothing, but eccleſia prima in ordine, not, tanquam habens authoritatem in cateras; which is no more then was determined in the Councel of Chalcedon. Can. 28. that the higheſt Church in Chriſtendome after Rome, ſhould neuertheles be magnified in Eccleſiaſticall menages, no leſſe themſhee. And this hath been told you, and rung into you,

So, ſtill might the Biſhop ſay, Poterat abſtinere Cardinalis à criando, the Cardinall might haue abſtained from quoting this law, and the law inter claras, is ſcarce a cleare law. Yet Baldus (you ſay) calls it, Clariſſimam legem. And yet he vouchſafes not to gloſſe it, ſcarce in three words, you know. His calling of it Clariſſima, with an alluſion to Inter Claras, is nothing, but as euery pettie Maſter is wont to praiſe the author that he expounds to his ſchollers, as Perſius notes,
—ab inſano multùm laudanda magiſtro.
As for Accurſius his gloſſing of it, and ſome one or two more, of how much leſſe force is that to proue the ſoundnes of it, then the ſilence of ſo many, that thinke it not worthy a gloſſe, to condemne it? Of whom you may preſently reckon theſe, more afterward, if they come to your mind: Bartholomeus de Saliceto, Cynus, Iacobus de Arena, Iaſon, Antonius alſo de Roſellis, if I miſtake not, Franciſcus Aretinus, Paulus Caſtrenſis, Butrigarius.

I paſſe by Hotoman, becauſe he was ours, otherwiſe no obſcure Father of the law, and hath written the largeſt of all in the cauſe. Whome he that hath vndertaken of late to anſwer, Andreas Fachineus Count of Lateran, in his eight booke of Controuerſies, hath not ſatisfied ſo fully in all points, as is thought. Neither about the contradiction of the Dates, nor eſpecially to the contradictions between Iuſtinian and himſelfe, one time not conſulting with the Pope of Rome, about Eccleſiaſticall matters (as he profeſſes to doe here notwithſtanding) namely in his ſo many Nouell Conſtitutions: another time making the Church of Conſtantinople, to be Head of all Churches: (lib. 24. c. de Sacroſancta Eccleſia,

                  : and the ſame againe, L. Decernimus 16. eodem titulo,) which here you would haue him ſeeme to giue to Rome. So as ſtill the law is no law de claris. Your oppoſitions to the contrarie are little worth, vnleſſe becauſe Hypatius and Demetrius were the meſſengers, no letter could be cog'd with their names, or that this muſt needes be the true Epiſtle, becauſe Pope Nicholas
                  
quotes a ſhred out of it, or that Iuſtinian confeſſeth he wrote to Pope Iohn, in a letter to Agapetus, which letter of Iuſtinians, you referring vs onely to Binnius for, ſome would ſooner queſtion for Binnius his ſake, then for the credit of it embrace the other. Though for my part, I like well of what I finde there, that Iuſtinian calls it the faith, quam ſequendam DVXIMVS, which ſhewes he depended not vpon the Popes approbation, no not for his faith. And the Pope receiuing it with willing gratulation, as he alſo there ſignifies, not his aſſent onely, but the whole Church of Romes was added to it: which if the Pope were infallible, what needed it? But the truth is, that you haue not yet reſolued, whether it be the Pope of Rome, or the Church of Rome, that cānot erre. Enough belike, if either of thē keepe vp the ball. Laſtly, to returne to the Epiſtle to Pope Iohn, let me aske you, what you thinke of the good Latin in it? (I ſpeake to a Priſcian, to a Latine Ariſtarchus.) Which not onely Iuſtinian, but perhaps Belliſarius himſelfe would not haue vttered in thoſe daies. As, Properamus creſcere honorem ſedis veſtrae, for, We make haſt to increaſe the honour of your ſeat. They did indeed, that meant to doe it by faining. To omit, that if Iuſtinian gaue aduancement to the ſeate, it is beholding to the Empire, not the Empire to it, and ſo we know from whence the worſhip of it flowed. I haue heard of ſome, that this was the cauſe, why certain would not gloſſe it, becauſe it fauours the opinion, that the primacie of Rome is iuris humani, or Imperatorij, not diuini. And yet doe you bring this law againſt vs? As if our ſelues could more deſpight the Pope, then by ſo ſaying. But proceed in your eloquence. Alieni Catholicae Dei Eccleſiae; which ſounds well in Greeke, not ſo in Latin: and no better that, Quae ad vos eſt vnitas ſanctarum eccleſiarum. Laſtly, Petimus vos orare pro nobis, & prouidentiam Dei nobis acquirere. All which, your elegancie would neuer digeſt for good Latine, nor worthy of Iuſtinian, if you are the man that you are taken for. The teſtimonie that you inſiſt vpon, of the perpetuall integritie

of your Romane Sea, that as often as any heretikes had riſen in thoſe parts, they had ſtill beene corrected by the ſentence thereof, was no warrant for the times to come. You did runne well, but who hath ſet you backe? Thou knoweſt not, ſaith Salomon, what a day brings forth. And if we be forbidden to boaſt of to morrow, how much leſſe of the conſequence of all times and ages, for the bleſſing of God hitherto affoarded? Yet theſe are your goodly proofes that the Chaire of Rome neuer tottered In the ſame booke of the Code, Lege Cunctos, Th odoſius, Gratianus, and Valentinian, (Edicto ad Conſtantinopol. C

But I note it for this; If the Popes authoritie be not ſufficient for our direction in matters of faith, except the Biſhop of Alexandria his name be ioyned with him for illuſtration ſake, what infallibilitie hath the one aboue the other? ſince, becauſe it corrected hereſies in Iuſtinians dayes.

                  Hierome ſpeaking of Rome, cals it quondam caput, the ſometime head of the world. No doubt, becauſe it was head in the right of the Empire, and that changing, the ſpirituall preheminēce of it changed alſo. So vncertaine are theſe things, and not built as you would haue it, vpon diuine ordinance, but either following the fauour & good liking of the Emperours, or the other variable ſtreame of cauſes. To conclude your Law, about the Ʋniuerſall authority of the Romane Sea: for ſo much as you quote Accurſius his gloſſe, heare what a ſtout obſeruation hee hath mode on both ſides of that cauſe. Iuſtinian cals the Biſhop of Conſtantinople, fratrem veſtrum, the Popes brother. Parificat ergo, therefore he equalls them, ſayes Accurſius. But ſtraight againe, and with the turning of a hand, becauſe the Emperour ſaies, ſequi feſtinans ſedem veſtram, that the Biſhop aforeſaid labours to follow the iudgement of your ſeat, Minor eſt ergo, therefore he is vnder him. Is not this well ſhot now? As if ſequi were to come behind in place, not to accord in opinion. And whereas the Pope, ſets the Emperours name before his owne, in the beginning of his Epiſtle, Iuſtiniano Iohannes, &c. Note, ſaies Accurſius, Papa praemittit Imperatorem, quod hodie non faceret, the Pope ſets the Emperours name before his owne, which at this day he would not; belike becauſe prouder. So much of this Lawe.
               § 55. THE labell, and the laſt of your firſt chapter, is this: The Biſhop to the Cardinall alleadging the words of the Pataran Biſhop, ſuing to Iuſtinian to reſtore Sylverius, whom he had condemned to baniſhment, which words ſeeme to ſpread the Popes authoritie verie farre, anſwered briefly, and in his wonted ſtyle, the ſtyle of wiſedome,

                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , or as the auncient Diuines ſay of taking the Sacrament, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ; What ſhould we heare Patarenſis his words, as long as we ſee Iuſtinians deedes? Iuſtinian baniſheth, Sylverius is baniſhed, Patarenſis pleads for him: Who is the Superiour? Not becauſe the words, that this pleader vſed in Sylverius his behalfe, to magnifie his reputation, could not otherwiſe be anſwered, as ſhall appeare anon, but beeing a nameleſſe perſon, and no where elſe mentioned (which is worthy your marking) the Biſhop ſhooke off both him and the Cardinall, in the aforeſaid faſhion. So the valiant beaſt, little mooued with the dog, or the hunters ſtaffe, goes on his iourney, minding other matters, as we read in the Poet,
               —Et tergo decutit haſtas.
               
                  By this reaſon, ſay you, neuer any thing in the world was ſo wickedly done, but it may be iuſtified. For, howſoeuer it bee reprehended by holy, graue, or learned men, thoſe that liſt to iuſtifie the fact, may ſay, Facta cum videamus, verba quid audiamus? When we ſee the deed, what ſhould we heare words, &c. As though it were not one thing to iuſtifie a thing done, by the ſimple doing of it, againſt all that might be excepted, or controlled in it, concerning the wickedneſſe, and another thing to auouch the power of the doer, or the authority of the doer, who howſoeuer abuſing the aduantage of his place, yet he doth no more then in that right he may, and his deeds paſſe for vncontrolled. As Nero, as Herod, as Pilate, whome you alleadge. Meritum criminis, not alwaies going with ordo poteſtatis; and ordo poteſtatis, often hauing his courſe, where there is no meritum criminis. For neither, when Syluerius was baniſhed by Iuſtinian, doe we iuſtifie Iuſtinian, as hauing done well, though we bid you marke what Iuſtinian did, but rather point at his authoritie, euidenced by ſuch actions: nor if we would prooue the power of heathen Caeſar ouer our Sauiour Chriſt, condemned by his deputy, and at length crucified, are wee therefore to be thought to approoue his deed, or the vſe of his iuriſdiction. And yet I

hope, it ſhewes where the authoritie reſted, and how true it was that our Sauiour ſaid, Non haberes poteſtatem in me, niſi deſuper datam, for ſo much as our Sauiour neuer excepted againſt Paſſus eſt ſub Pontio Pilato. This it a maine cauſe of Pilates coming into the Creede. And the Papiſts doctrine oppoſing Magiſtracie, oppoſes ſo the Creed, & gathers faſt vpon hereſie. him as an incompetent Magiſtrate, but willingly ſubmitted himſelfe to the very death. According as S. Andrew, of whome we read in the Decret. part. 2. cauſ. 23. qu. 1. Decrees, that beeing condemned to die by the Lieftenant of Achaia, when ſome would haue reskued him, he deſired them, not; Quaeſo, ne impedite martyrium meum: I pray, good people, diſturbe not my martyrdome. Who if pyrats, or theeues, had offered him this violence, without any lawfull calling of Magiſtracie, I ſuppoſe he would not haue refuſed to haue ſaued himſelfe by all honeſt meanes. As S. Paul did againſt whipping, Act. 22. He oppoſed, ſaies S. Auſten, his ciuill priuiledge, to defend him, in the aſſault of his ſacred faith, as the left hand holds out it ſelfe to protect the right. What ſo naturall? Cùm percuteretur dextra, opponeb at ſiniſtram: in Pſal. 120.

The countermine of Powers temporall op pugning the truth, is to the godly couragious a glorious triall, to the faint of courage a dangerous aſſault. But the ſame powers, whē they ſtand for the auouching of truth, to the honeſt-hearted that are in errour, they are profitable aduertiſers: but to the fooliſh and beſotted, bootleſſe

And yet by your leaue, Sir, howſoeuer you excuſe Sylvenius, in your relation how the matter paſſed, (as I can not blame you, if you be loath to haue more traytours regiſtred in the beadroll of your Popes, then needes you muſt,) both Procopius and Euagrius, lib. 4. cap. 19. ſhew, that he was held in ſuſpition of high treaſon, as drawing the Gothes to beſiege the citie, and an author of your owne, In vit

                   to trayterous attempts. Neither was this any cauſe, that Euagrius mentions, or in the leaſt ſort points at, why Iuſtinian afterward was ſtricken of God, but rather his hereticall declining from the faith. Now we neuer denied but Emperours, if they be men, may fall into hereſie, but euen in hereſie we ſo free them from the feare of earthly controll, as tremblingly we referre them to the heauenly cenſure. Neither yet for lacke of learning was Iuſtinian puniſhed, nor it may be for want of that ſo much as ſeduced to hereſie (though you would gladly inſinuate ſo much out of Suidas) ſith many wanting learning, haue both knowne the right faith, and kept it to the ende. I am ſure Pope Iohn, in the Epiſtle that begins Inter claras, of which before, cals him edoctum Eccleſiaſticis diſciplinis, taught in Church-learning, or Church-diſciplines. Suidas alſo, at the place that you quote out of him,

T. nor any of your ſide, remembring your Popes; neede greatly to obiect the defects of learning to a ſecular Emperour; many of the Popes comming to their preferment, as if it were by that rule which Aquinas cites out of the 70. Pſal. when he would defend 
                     Geburoth and Sopheroth no friēds in Poperie. 2. 2. quaeſt. 188. art. 3. ſuch proceedings, but not from his heart, Propterea quòd non cognovi literaturam, ideo introibo in potentias Domini. And was it learning, or charitie, that you lacked trow, when you ſaid, that Euagrius places Iuſtinian in hell, to endure penalties: whereas he onely ſaies, he was taken from hence, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to abide the triall of the places beneath. Which not onely your owne Popiſh relligion, holding more vnderground places then hell, but the right faith would teach you ſo to conſtiue, as ſhould be no preiudice to Iuſtinians ſalvation. You cite alſo Euagrius about the ſuddeneſſe of his death, as a puniſhment of God, which Euagrius mentions not in the leaſt word, but

For firſt, what is this to the temporall primacie? which we deſcry here to be  the Emperours, and not the Popes, by Iuſtinians driuing him into baniſhment; they call it, I know, Belliſarius his act, but in the power of Iuſtinian, no doubt, and for a ſecular matter, viz. for treaſon. So as the Pope is ſubiect to the Emperours cenſure for ciuill faults. 
                   Secondly, let him bee Pope ouer the Church of the whole world, that is, in order of preheminence (not in right of gouernment, or confirmed iuriſdiction) as the cheife Patriarch; which is euident by the compariſon, or diſpariſon rather, of earthly Kings there vſed, whereof one hath no ſuch reference of order to an other, but the Patriarchall Seas are fixed, ſaith S. Leo, by inviolable Canon, legibus ad finem mundi manſuris,

Thirdly, there is this difference betweene Kings and Prieſts, that Kings are confined to their owne dominions, and if they be taken without them, they looſe their priuiledge, and ſtand but for little better then ſubiects in thoſe parts: whereas the Prieſt may exerciſe his acts of office, in euery part of the Chriſtian world, as bind, or looſe, or preach, or adminiſter, or ordaine alſo, if he be therevnto called. And if he be reſtrained

from any of theſe, it is Eccleſiâligante, as your Tapper telleth vs, and Viguerius, and diuerſe more, quae ligat & ligare, which euen binds out binding, and for orders ſake confines that but to certaine places, which is indifferent to all by primitiue ordination. See your ſelfe of this point, cap. 2. numb. 50. & 52. Whoſoeuer is Paſtor in any one part of the Church, is capable of Paſtorall iuriſdiction in any other, though he be reſtrained to auoid confuſion. And Baſil ſaies of Athanaſius, pag. 304. of the Greeke by Frobenius (for the Epiſtles are not numbred) That hee takes no leſſe care for the whole Church, or rather all the Churches, then that which was ſpecially committed to him by our Lord. So Chryſoſtome ſayes of the Prieſt, that he is,

                        . And againe, S. Chryſoſt. hom. 3. in Acta Apoſt. Ethico. calls euery Biſhop in generall 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the Biſhop ouer all men, and yet in the ſame place ſayes, That no Biſhop in Biſhop ouer more then one Citie. Both of which make for vs againſt you, and ſeeming contrary include no contradiction. Yea Hom. 8. in Acta, hee ſaies twice together, that his Lay-auditors ſhalbe Occumenicall Maſters, if they do this & this, of his preſcribing. Alſo 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : They ſhal be to all, that which he is to them. 
                  beneuolentiam praeferens; of which happily hereafter. The ſame Chryſoſtome againe, Epiſt. 176. ad Paeanium, twice attributes as much to him, to be rector or rectifyer, as he there ſpeakes, of the whole world. And doth not S. Hierome beginne his Epiſtle ad Salvinianam ſo, that the care of euery Chriſtian belongs vnto him, as he is a miniſter of Gods Church, pro officio Sacerdotij, & that their good proceeding is his glory? S. Salvian alſo ad Salon. l. 1. adv. Avar. Ad fidei meae curā. pertinet (as if not his Charities onely) nequid eccleſiaſtici operis vacillare permittā. When S. Chryſoſt. went into baniſhmēt, Chryſoſt. in quadam epiſt. you may pleaſe to remēber how the Monks ſaluted him, that the ſun might ſooner looſe his light, thē his vertue be eclipſed: & yet I hope his iuriſdiction did not ſtretch, in your opiniō,

as farre as the ſunne, which if Patareus Apollo had but ſaid of Sylverius, you would preſently haue concluded in fauour of him.  I omit many things, to come to an ende. Of Iuſtinians  Conſtitutions, about matter of faith, directed to the Biſhops, ſometime of Rome, ſometime of Conſtantinople, which you ſo often tell vs of. Doe you ſee therefore, what power the Emperour had in ſpirituall cauſes, to giue forth Conſtitutions? 
                   That Agapetus depoſed Anthimus, and ſet vp Menas, but cauſa perorata apud Iuſtinianum, Iuſtinian hauing  firſt the hearing of the cauſe, & by his authoritie, no doubt, though a Biſhop was vſed to ſentence a Biſhop, as was   Principis fauore Liberat. c. 21. moſt meete far forme;
                   Like as Menas was preferred to Anthimus his place, but how? as a ſpeciall fauorite of Iuſtinian, ſaith the ſtorie, and ſo you may be ſure by his direction.  That Agapetus his iudgement of Anthimus was faine to be  ſcanned in a Councell of Conſtantinople, gathered for that purpoſe by the Emperor, before the proceedings of a Pope could giue ſatisfaction to the Church.  That Patarenſis doth not excuſe Biſhops in generall from the Emperours cenſure,  as you would haue it, but onely mooues him to ſhew reſpect to Sylverius, for the amplitude of his place.  And laſtly, the Emperour as he binds him ouer to triall, to ſee  whether he were guiltie of treaſon or no, ſo if he were found guiltie, he forbids him Rome;  which ſhewes that the Pope and Rome may be two, and bodes but ill, as if ſome  Emperour one day, or Imperiall man, ſhould make the diuorce. On the other fide, it ſets out Iuſtinians praiſe, that was content to puniſh treaſon ſo moderately, as not vtterly to take his Biſhopricke from him, but onely to ſend him packing to Palmaria, or Fonicuſa, as now they call it. Laſtly, whereas he reuerenced, you ſay, the Sea Apoſtolick, let them periſh hardly that reuerence not the very place, where the doue hath troad, fleeing to the windowes, but with meete proportion, becauſe corrupted ſince.
               
            
            
               
               To the ſecond Chapter, about ſundrie paſſages in the Councell of Chalcedon.
               
                  IN the Romane diſcipline when of fendours were many, they vſed a courſe call'd Decimation, to chaſtiſe euery tenth perſon onely, for the miſdemeanour of a multitude: So muſt I herafter, but point as it were at euery tenth ſoloeciſme, which occurres in the peruſing of the Adioynder; it beeing hard I graunt, for any to auoid faults in multiloquio, as the wiſe man tells vs, but ſpecially for him, as I ſhould thinke, who ſo purpoſely ſtudieth it, as if he meant to oppreſſe vs with a flood of tearmes, and wearie the Reader whome he cannot perſwade. Wherein he could not ſhew himſelfe more aduerſe to his aduerſarie, whoſe praiſe is compendiouſnes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , like the gold coynes, that include great worth in ſmall compaſſe, and Timantus pictures, preſenting more to the minde then to the eye.
               § 2. And for ſo much as I haue profeſſed, as the truth is, that my taske now was to iuſtifie the allegations onely of the Biſhops booke, againſt ſuch idle ſcruples, as this man caſts in euery where, hauing ſhewed, as I may ſay, by the blow in the forehead, ſo by this firſt encounter, that if neede were, I could take more aduantage, and rippe vp this Golias, this bulke of paper, as the other was of fleſh, to his greater ſhame, I will now proceede with all poſſible breuitie.
               § 3. About the Biſhops allegation of the Councell of Chalcedon, the 28. Canon, partly he ſtruggles to ſhift it off, partly he cauills with him, about the quoting of it. In which reſpect,

I haue thought good, firſt of all to ſet it downe, as it lies in our bookes. In all points following the Decrees of the holy Fathers, and admitting the Canon lately read, of the 150 moſt bleſſed Biſhops, aſſembled together vnder the great Emperour Theodoſius, of pious memorie, in the Imperiall Conſtantinople, new Rome, we alſo decree and determine the ſame things, concerning the priuiledges of the moſt holy Church of Conſtantinople afore-ſaid, the new Rome. For iuſtly did the Fathers giue priuiledges to the throne of old Rome, becauſe that Citie was then regent. And the 150 moſt bleſſed Biſhops, mooued with the ſame conſideration, gaue equall priuiledges to the moſt holy throne of new Rome: wiſely iudging it meete and reaſonable, that the Citie which enioyed both Empire and Senate, and was endued with the like priuiledges (or equall priuiledges) that old Rome was, ſhould in matters Eccleſiaſticall be aduanced and magnified, euen as ſhee (or no leſſe then ſhee) beeing ſecond after her, (not ſubiect to her, but, ſecond after her: yet F. T. ſaies the Biſhop left out thoſe words of ſet purpoſe. Rather indeede becauſe nothing to the purpoſe.) And that &c. Euen as, if I breake off now, and Engliſh not the reſt, no wiſe man nor learned, that hath but read the Canon, will deeme I breake off fraudulently, or for aduantage, but onely becauſe that which followes is not materiall. Now ſee what exceptions the gentleman takes to the Biſhops allegation. As firſt, that he ſhould ſay, that the Canon makes the two Seas, the one of Rome, the other of Conſtantinople, equall in all things. What is here amiſſe? Equall, ſaies the text, ſicut illam, euen as the other: and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  equall priuiledges. But where is that in all things, ſaies the wrangler?  The words perhaps not, but the ſenſe  ſo cleere, that without that, the Canon were no Canon, and the reſt of the words to no purpoſe at all.  Haue you not  heard, that indefinites are equiualent to vniuerſalls, eſpecially where one exception beeing made, it is plaine that all others are thereby cut off, according to the rule, Exceptio figit regulam in non exceptis? And therefore the ranke, or the prioritie in order, beeing onely reſerued to Rome in that

place, as it followes about Conſtantinople, that ſhee ſhould ſecunda poſt illā exiſtere, be ſecond in rew, as the new Rome to the old Rome, the old beeing firſt, and the new ſecond, is it not cleere, that there is equalitie in all things elſe graunted to Conſtantinople, and the magnifying or aduancing of her in Eccleſiaſticall matters, ſicut illa, as ſhee, or, no leſſe then ſhee, generally to be extended as farre as Romes? 
                  Sozomene ſaies expreſſely,  for ciuill matters, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , ſhee was equalled in all things, Conſtantinople with Rome, lib. 7. cap. 9. and the ground of the Canon is, the equalitie of the two cities in ciuill affaires. Therefore, either the Fathers conclude not well, out of their owne premiſſes, or els the equalitie of the two Seas, euen in Eccleſiaſticall matters, is to be vnderſtood ſecundum omnia, in euery reſpect. 
                   For as in the one, ſo in the others, let it be, ſay the Fathers. To omit that as Error is  ſubiect to Inconſtancie, you anſwer this afterward another way your ſelfe, that there might be equalitie, ſeruatâ proportione, and onely in compariſon with inferiour Seas, where you will not denie, but per omnia, may be borne in that ſenſe, in the alleadging of the Canon, though the text hath it not. The Biſhop therefore might adde it without iniurie to the Text, though it be not in the letter.  Yea in your 47  numb. of this preſent Chap. you giue the Cardinall leaue to adde Totius, where there is none in the Text, but vineae only without totius, ſaying he doth it for explication ſake. And may not we then, vpon ſo good grounds, as you haue not for Totius out of all that Epiſtle, but we haue for per omnia, out of the circumſtances of the Canon, as hath beene ſhewed? I ſuppoſe if two Conſulls ſhould ſtriue for preheminence,  or two States of Ʋenice (to vſe your owne compariſon in another place of this brooke,) and the Iudge ſhould ſo order it, that they ſhould both haue equall allowance of honour, the paria priuilegia that you are ſo ſtumbled at, (for ſo I conſtrue them, and I thinke the righter) one to be aduanced in matters of gouernment, as well as the other, onely that one ſhould hold the ſecond place, and the other the

                  firſt, were it not euident that they were equalled in all points, though the word all were not by him expreſſed, ſaue onely in paritie of ranke and order? So the caſe was here. The Biſhop of Rome was to ſit afore the other in aſſemblies and meetings, to be mentioned before him in the praiers Barlaam. of the Church, to deliuer his opinion and iudgement firſt, and yet for matter of authoritie or iuriſdiction, one Sea to be magnified ſicut altera, euen as much as the other, and that per omnia, in all reſpects, whatſoeuer F. T. grinne to the contrarie.
               § 4. And by this we anſwer to his other wiſe obiection, that if preheminence of order bee reſerued to Rome, how then does the Canon make them equall in all things? In all things elſe, this onely excepted, which the Canon excepts, and nothing elſe, to ſhew, that as for other things, they are to be equalled in all.
               § 5. Yet you cauill the Biſhop, for leauing out that clauſe of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the ſecond after the other, namely, Conſtantinople after Rome, as if the Biſhop had left it out, becauſe making againſt himſelfe, which was nothing to the purpoſe to haue inſerted, becauſe it concernes not the primacy of authoritie, but of order onely, about which wee ſtriue not.
               § 6. As for the printing of thoſe words, in all things, in a different letter, which according to the meaſure of your accuſtomed franknes, you call corrupt and fraudulent dealing, how often ſhal we tell you, that the Biſhop followed the differēce of the letter, as diuerſe others haue done, and daily doe, to ſpecifie the thing it ſelfe intended by the Canon, and to imprint it the deeper in the Readers mind, not as alleadging the letter of it, and ſo counterfeiting, as you pleaſe to call it. From which in truth he was ſo farre, that you make it his fault in this very Chapter, num. 3. not to offer to lay it down, or the words of it, but onely to argue, and to drawe conſequences therefrom, as his occaſion ſerued.
               § 7. Now whereas you would explicate the Canons meaning,

by the words following, about the ordaining of certaine Biſhops by the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, as Pontus, Aſia, Thracia, &c. and by exempting that Sea, from ſtanding ſubiect any longer to the Biſhopricke of Heraclea, of which it was once but a parcell; it is true, that from thence, euen from ſo low eſtate, it was exalted by conſent, to be a patriarchall Sea, and not euery ſuch neither, but the ſecond in order, and ſetting that aſide, equall to Rome in all reſpects. Elſe neither ſhould this Canon haue ſuffered ſuch oppoſition, you may bee ſure, at the Biſhop of Romes hands, nor needed the Fathers to name this ſo diſtaſtfull equalitie with Rome, in the bodie of the Canon, if nothing but the ordaining of Biſhops had been aſſigned him, which other Patriarches exerciſe in their dioceſſe, as well as the Biſhop of Rome, without his repining. And yet laſtly, you may remember, that the Canon of Nice, deſcribing the preheminence Can. 6. of the Biſhop of Rome, as a patterne of Patriarchſhip, vtters it in thoſe words of Ruffinus tranſlation, quòd Eccleſiarum ſuburbicariarum curam habeat, that he hath care of the Churches that are abutting vpon the citie; to which Canon of Nice, ſpreading ſo the iuriſdiction of the Church of Rome, this Canon of Chalcedon may ſeeme to allude, mentioning ſo many Churches as you here recite, and all of them ſubiect to the Sea of Conſtantinople.
               
               § 8. As for that you thruſt in here, vpon verie ſmall occaſion, of Athanaſius of Alexandria appealing to Iulius Biſhoppe of Rome, to ſhewe that Alexandria was ſubiect to Rome, if you meane the ſubiection of order and ranke, it is nothing to the matter, and yet it followeth not, by your leaue, out of your example. The ſubiection of authoritie is that which we contend about, and yet that much leſſe may be gathered from hence. For neither did Athanaſius flee to Iulius alone, but with his companie of Biſhops, as his letters Athanaſiapol. conera Arian. ſhew, that he brought in his behalfe, Omnibus vbi
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Catholicae Eccleſiae Epiſcopis,. i. To all the Biſhops of the Catholicke Church: and againe, Hac quidem & ad omnes, & ad Iulium

ſcripſere:. i. This they wrote to Iulius, and to all. And the Church that enioies more flouriſhing fortunes, or whoſe arme God hath ſtrengthened with temporall proſperitie, may bee ſought vnto of the diſtreſſed, though not ſubiect to it, by any dutie of obedience, as one King (ſayes the Orator) eaſily 
                     Pro lege Manil. Regum afflictae opes faciſe alliciunt miſericordiam. reſcues and ſuccors another, though not referring to him by ſubiection, no more then Mithridates did to Tigranes; as alſo I doubt not, but if Iulius had ſuffered wrong, and Athanaſius could haue holpe him, neither would Iulius haue diſdained to craue his aſſiſtance, nor Athanaſius haue refuſed him; no more then the aforeſaid Biſhop of Patara did to ſue for Syluerius, and to ſheild him all he could, againſt the rage of Iuſtinian, as euen now you told vs; and yet he of Patara, much inferiour to the other without queſtion.
               § 9. But, to deale more liberally with the Biſhop in this point, put caſe (ſay you) that the Councell of Chalcedon did meane to giue to the Church of Conſtantinople that equality with the Sea of Rome, which he affirmeth; yet he ſhould nothing gaine by it, but rather it confirmes the primacie of Pope Leo, whoſe onely authority was able to quaſh it. How is that prooued? Firſt, becauſe the Canon tooke not place preſently. Which is no more then happens, for the moſt part, to any lawe, to haue ſlower execution then it hath making. But does it follow from hence, that either the Biſhop alleages a counterfeit Canon, (for by this reaſon you may cauill any Canon in the booke) or that Leo's authority was of force to diſanull it? Let vs breifly looke into it, as not much to our purpoſe. For in truth, what ende may we looke for of diſpute, if ſo pregnant allegations be reckoned for counterfeit? By a few heads we may iudge of all the reſt. You obſerue 4. things out of Gelaſius his Epiſtle to the Biſhops of Dardania, to diſprooue the Canon.
               
               § 10.  One, that Martian prayſed Leo for not ſuffering the old Canons to be violated in that point, and yet himſelfe zealous for the aduancement of Conſtantinople. The anſwer is moſt eaſie, He might take Leo's excuſe in good part, as grounded

vpon pretence of conſcience, not to croſſe the Canons, though it was ſo farre from beeing ſound, that both Leo might haue altered them as your ſelfe confeſſe, (poſitiue Canons) 
                  Num 70. huius & num. 28. and afterward it was altered euen by a generall Councell, (if that of Lateran at leaſt was general) as you acknowledge. And I hope, Sir, I may praiſe Conſtancy, euen in mine aduerſary, and in a wrong matter, though I could wiſh his conſtancy were better imployed. So might Martian with Leo; and ſomewhat the rather, to induce him by addoulcings; for direct thwarting alienates rather. Is this a good reaſon now, why the Canon ſhould be no Canon, or this alſo ſcored among the Biſhops forgeries?
               
               § 11.  You ſay ſecondly, that Anatolius, in fauour of whom the Canon was made, beeing rebuked by Leo for his forwardnes to preferre it, deriued the fault vpon the Clergy of Conſtantinople, and ſaid it was poſitum in ipſius poteſtate; Leo might chuſe whether he would grant it or no. Anſwer. That the Clergie of Conſtantinople concurred to the making of it, I hope, good Sir, derogates not from the Canon, but rather fortifies it, as likewiſe the conſent of ſo many other Biſhops; and if Leo's ſhake, beſtriding his praye (that is, the honour of his ſeate, the ſingularity rather) affrighted Anatolius, and ſtartled lentum illum Heli, as he calls him, that timorous old man, what is that to the antiquating of the Decree of a Synode, and ſo populous a Synode as this was? For I hope the Canon was not ſo in fauour of Anatolius, (whatſoeuer you prattle) but that much rather of his Sea, then of his perſon, as both the reaſon ſhewes which the Canon contaynes, drawne, as you may remember, from the Imperiall city, and Martians loue was to the city, not to the man. Yea it rather tooke place, you ſay, after his death. What then doe you tell vs of Anatolius?
               
               § 12.  Your third obſeruation, that Pope Simplicius was as loath to yeild to Leo the Emperour, for the aduancement of Conſtantinople, as Leo the Pope had beene to the Emperour Martian in the ſame cauſe, prooues nothing againſt the Canon, vnleſſe

it be graunted, that the Pope hath a negatiue voice in the making of them, which is the thing in queſtion betweene you and vs, & therefore to be prooued, not to be preſumed. But if you meane, that it took not place ſo ſoone, you haue your anſwer before, it brake out at laſt like fire in the bones, and thats enough.
               § 13.  With like facility to your Quartum Notabile, that Acacius obtained the cenſures of Pope Felix, and executed them vpon the Biſhops of Alexandria and Antioch. What then? As if one Biſhop may not craue aide of another, to repreſſe abuſes, when he cannot doe it himſelfe, euen as they in Peters boate, beckened to the next to come and helpe them, (for your primacie is that Moſes taken out of the waters by your owne deſcription) ſo here Acacius becken to Peter, that is, to the Pope himſelfe, as you dreame. Neither thinke you that Acacius was the Popes mā, to execute his pleaſure, but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as Homer ſayes. And, congregatis vobiſcum vnà cum meoſpiritu, as in all excommunications, ſo ſpecially, I ſuppoſe, when Patriarches are to be cenſured. Does not Gelaſius ſay ſo, in the Epiſtle that you quote, Ipſo quoque Acacio poſtulante, vel exequente. Where you ſee what execution Acacius performed, namely, with which Poſtulation might well ſtand, which is not the miniſters, or the vnder-officers part, to demand cenſure againſt offenders, but only to lay it on as is enioyned. We read in the ſame Epiſtle, that Acacius proceeded againſt other two Patriarches of the aforeſaid Seas, whereof one was Calendion, whome Gelaſius names, the other vnnamed, onely qualiſcunque Catholicus, as Gelaſius ſtyles him, and that neither with a Synods, as Gelaſius there ſayes, nor by cenſure obtained from the Sea of Rome, for ought that hee implyes, but belike of his owne head; yet Acacius had no authoritie ouer the aforeſaid Patriarches. No more then hath the Pope ordinary ouer them, whome in caſu, and quantum fas eſt, he may offer to excommunicate, when they are otherwiſe incorrigible. And therfore this prooues no Supremacie neither, of the Pope aboue

other Patriarches, that Acacius as you ſay executed his cenſures.
               § 14. What ſhould I ſay of them that withſtood theſe cenſures of the Pope, and deſpiſed them? and yet godly men, and allowed by the Church. Which ſhewes, that they breath from no ſuch power, as you imagine. See Auſten contra Donatiſt. l. 5. c. 25. of Cyprian, not forfeiting his freehold in the Church, though he were one of them, quos Stephanus Papa abſtinendos putauerat, whome Stephen Pope doomed with excommunication. Irenaeus cenſured Victors cenſuring Euſeb. l. 5. c. 25. of the Churches of Aſia, where Baronius would triumph vpon the name of Victor, as if ſtraightway victorie went with Rome, but giue me Irenaeus for the 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in choro noſtro, the ſupremacie will goe rather on his ſide. Bleſſed are the peacemakers. So likewiſe did Polycrates, if you Ibid. c 26. regard names ſo much, a man compounded of multitudes and power, which two endowments your Church much delights in. Anicetus, a pretie name too, to guggle Baronius, yet reſiſted Ibid. by Polycarpus, not abhorring in his nomenclature frō the Churches propertie, Eſa. 54. Paulinus in his Epiſtle ad Sulpitium Seuerum, calls the buzze of the Pope, or the bull, as you tearm it, vacui murmur culicis, the trumpeting, or the wheeſing of a ſilly gnat, that was all he ſet by it. Tertullian hath many flings at him, as Pamelius will tell you, and no maruell De liturgicis Fragment. Hilarij. for the rigour he ſuſtained among them. S. Hilarie to Liberius, Quotapars orbis es tu? as much to ſay, as, what are you, ſir, that you ſhould ſo take on? And ſometime other Biſhops did as much for the Pope, I meane, they excommunicated him, no bodie controlling them. For it is ius commeabile, or, ius reciprocum, paſſing and walking from the one to the other. In the Councel of Epheſus, the Biſhops that held with Apolog. Cyrilli Mandat. Synod. Epheſ. 
                  Cyrill and Memnon, Scire autem volumus veſtram ſanctitatem, &c. We doe you to wit, (euen you the Popes Legates repreſenting his perſon) that if you deſpiſe ought of theſe things, you are thereby ſhut out from our Communion. what was that in effect but excommunication? Laſtly, you tell vs, that Acacius

obeyed the Pope for a time, as much to ſay, as, while hee liſted himſelfe. And euen Gelaſius, when he affirmes him to ſtand excommunicate, by vertue of the excommunications that he procured againſt others, he meanes iure meriti, not, iure fori, deſert beeing one thing, ſentence another. Vnleſſe you will ſay, that Nathan cenſured Dauid, in, Tues homo, which was rather Dauids act againſt himſelfe, like that in the Goſpell, Ex ore tuo iudico te, which in Conc. Sinueſſano was made you knowe whoſe priuiledge, not the Biſhops of Conſtantinople, but the Biſhop of Romes, (though very ridiculouſly) that no bodie ſhould proceed againſt him, but onely himſelfe. And ſo much of your foure reaſons out of Gelaſius his Epiſtle, why this canon ſhould be inſufficient.
               § 15. In the examples that you bring vs, of ſuch Biſhops of Conſtantinople, as ſought for vnion with the ſea of Rome, what a childiſh ignorance is it, not to be able to diſcerne betweene the vnion of conſent in matters of faith, and vnion of ſubiection, which implies ſuperiority, that they neuer acknowledged in the Popes ouer them? Was there no vnion ſought for but with Rome? Or, doe not all the members of the great bodie pant for it, each ſtring of that harpe endeauour after accordance, to make vp the perfect harmony of Chriſtianity? No doubt this is that which the Apoſtle ſaith, Did the word of God come out from you alone? or to you alone?

Loe the primacie of the Sea of Rome, ſay you, grounded vpon our Sauiours expreſſe words, with little regard to the equality of priuiledges in the Councell of Chalcedon, which the Biſhop ſo much ſtandeth vpon. Thus you will neither giue leaue to the learned Fathers, to deflect thoſe words after a witty manner, to their innocent purpoſe, as Pighius ſaies of ſome of them, that ſcripturae ijs naſcuntur ſub manu, for their

Who knows not that the Preſidents of generall Coūcels, are not alwaies the chiefeſt Biſhops in Chriſtendome? As Cyrill, as Hoſius, as diuers more. Cui non concilio praefuit Hoſius? and yet Hoſius a Cordevant, not a Romane Biſhop.
               § 17. The like of the depoſition of diuers Biſhops of Conſtantinople, by the Popes, as you ſay, and namely that Agapetus depoſed Anthimus, with many more. Shall I tell you what wiſe men are wont to ſay in this caſe? Agapetus did depoſe Anthimus; but was Anthimus depoſed? as much to ſay, They did their beſt, but de bene eſſe onely, and, valeat vt valere poteſt, for, authoritie they had none. And therefore all this while, the Canon is not impeached but remains good.

But I goe forward. Indeed nothing is more abſurd, or rather can be, then your deſcanting vpon intercedere, in a double ſenſe, that you bring, to ſhew you haue ſome ſmacke of the Latin yet, at leaſt when your maſters and monitors helpe you. Becauſe the Biſhop had ſaid, Leone fruſtrà intercedente per literas ſuas apud Auguſtum, Auguſtam, & Anatolium; that the Canon tooke place for all that Leo could doe by his letters to the Emperour, to the Empreſſe, and to Anatolius: you dreame of interceſſion like that to the Saints, which you build out of places as well conſtrued as this. And becauſe in other places, the Biſhop happily ſo vſeth the word, following your owne tearmes, for your better capacitie, therefore you conclude he vſes it ſo here, but eſpecially becauſe elſe, Leo ſhould haue beene ſo potent as to reſiſt the Emperour. As if intercedere per literas, did not a little mollifie the matter, which is to hinder and to diſſwade, but by his writing onely, and how humble that? Or to ſhew that Leo did all he could, yet to no purpoſe; which fruſtrà giues you to vnderſtand, added by the Biſhop in the ſame ſentence, non fruſtrà. But if you will needes make Leo ſo ſawcie a Prelate, you may doe as you pleaſe, your iudgement is free concerning the Popes whom you pretend to honour: we find his letters to be of another ſtraine, very humble & ſupplicatorie, towards the great ones eſpecially, and had rather conſtrue more gently of him.

Neither any command ſhall you finde giuen by him to the Emperour, nor reſiſtance of authoritie, though he profeſſe much zeale to maintaine the Canons, thinking he might not breake them, as was ſaid before. Wherein neuertheleſſe, you diſſent from him, and ſay he might. So as, if you had beene his counſellor, not onely this had bin a Canon, but euen a Canon by Leo's owne conſent, which you ſo much oppoſe, vnder colour of his name at this day.
               § 19. But are the Ieſuits ſo idle, or ſo adle rather, as to thinke that they may put ſuch tricks, I will not ſay vpon the Biſhop, cui nulla ciconia pinſit, but vpon the yongeſt ſcholler in our Vniuerſities, as becauſe intercedere hath a double ſenſe, either to withſtand, or to entreat, they may pin which they liſt of the twaine vpon vs? Was not the word rather choſe by the Biſhop of purpoſe, to ſhew what a withſtanding Leo vſed, namely ioyned with entreatie, as if all his reſiſtance could not goe beyond praiers? which another that had waighed the double meaning of the word, and with ſingle eye lookt into the matter, would rather haue beleeued to be the Biſhops very drift and eſpeciall aime. But how ſhould then the Adioynder haue blurred ſo much paper, to ſhew that Leo did make no ſuit? Sure thoſe words before alleadged out of his Epiſtle to Marcian, put it out of doubt, that he did make ſuit, whatſoeuer this iangler mumble to the contrarie. Et precor & ſedulâ ſuggeſtione vos obſecro, I both pray and beſeech you, dutifully aduiſing, or informing. What can be plainer? As for that he ſaies, non fruſtrà, not in vaine, becauſe the Emperour praiſed Leo for his conſtancie, we haue refuted it before, and the very euent proclaimes as much, that it was fruſtrà, or in vaine, the Canon hauing gotten the credit, which they in vaine maligne.
               § 20. Now for that which he cites out of his Epiſtle to Pulcheria, the 55. in number, Conſenſiones Epiſcoporum repugnantes regulis apud Niceam conditis, in irritū mittimus, if it

had beene onely ſo, it might haue ſhewed Leoes reſolution againſt the Canon, and his ſtoutnes to deny it for his part, not but all this while he was ſuppliant to the Empereſſe. But when he addes moreouer, vnitâ nobiſcum veſtrae fidei pietate, and, per authoritatem B. Petri Apoſtols, what a vantage does this giue, euen to Pulcheria her ſelfe, to interpoſe in determination of Church-buſineſſes, and as it ſeemes, a kind of fellowſhip in S. Peters authority? Yet this is our lay-Ieſuites diſh aboue Commons, which before he called liberall dealing.
               
               § 21. Concerning Anatolius his receauing to fauour, and I know not what ſubmiſſion, that he would faine bring him to, as it were to aske Leo pardon, I muſt tell him as before, that Anatolius his cauſe, and the Canon are two. If either weakenes, or diſſimulation, made him to ſhrink, yet the Canon proſpered and thriued daily: neither did the Biſhop ſay, fruſtrà, contra ingenium perſonae, but contra Canonē
                   only, in that Leo made head in vaine againſt the Canon, not againſt Anatolius his diſpoſition, which is nothing to our matter.
               § 22. Neither are his reaſons ſound, which he brings, why Leo ſhould be againſt the Canon, though as I ſayd, neither this touches at all the Biſhop, as beeing no refutation of any part of his booke, neither is it ought worthy our conſideration, ſince we hold the Canon might be good without Leo. Indeede they hold that Leoes conſent was requiſite to the enacting of it, but that they prooue not. His reaſons for Leo are theſe 4. 
                  Firſt becauſe it ſprang from Anatolius proud humour, to aduance himſelfe inordinately. But this is a flat ſlaunder of Anatolius, not a iuſtification of Leo: or, though it were true of Anatolius priuate part, that he had a touch of the Luciferian ſpirit, to exalt his neſt, and climbe higher, which is not ſo likely, yet the concurrers with Anatolius in his deſire for Conſtantinople, were led, as is apparant, with farre diuerſe reſpects. In their Epiſtle to Leo, the Fathers of that Councell mention theſe: 1. To gratifie the Emperours, who reioyced in it: 2. to ſhew their zeale to the Senate: 3. their honour to the citie of Conſtantinople it ſelfe: and 4. laſtly,

                  not onely from the good liking of perſons, but à naturâ rei, to establiſh order, and to abandon confuſion out of the Church of God. You ſee all was not for Anatolius his ſake, whom you ſo much talke of.
               § 23.  Secondly, becauſe it was made you ſay in the abſence of his Legates, and by ſurreption. Anſwer. That it was made in their abſence, it was their owne default, who would not ſtay: but that it was made by ſurreption, it is your vntruth: for they all gaue conſent to it againe the next day, and proteſted ſtrongly againſt this imputation. You ſhall heare the Councell it ſelfe for the firſt of theſe; Act. 16. ſo wee read. Paſchaſinus & Lucentius vicegerents to the Sea Apoſtolick ſaid: If it pleaſe your highnes we haue ſomewhat to ſay to you. The moſt glorious Iudges anſwered, Say what you will. Paſchaſinus and Lucentius ſaid, Yeſterday after your Highnes were riſen, and we followed your ſteps, there were certaine things decreed as we heare, which we thinke were done beſides the order and Canons of the Church. We beſeech you therefore that your excellencies would command the ſame to be read againe, that the whole company may ſee whether it were rightly or diſorderly done. The moſt glorious Iudge anſwered, If any thing were decreed after our departures, let it be read againe. And before the reading, Aetius Archdeacon of Conſtantinople (after a few other words premiſed) ſaid thus. We had ſomewhat to doe for the Church of Conſtantinople. We prayed the Biſhops that came from Rome, that they would [ſtay and] communicate with vs. They refuſed, ſaying, we may not, we are otherwiſe charged. We acquainted your Honours with it, and you willed that this holy Councell ſhould conſider of it. Your highnes then departing, the Biſhops that are here, conferring of a common cauſe, required this to be done. And here they are. It was not done in ſecret, nor by ſtealth, but orderly and lawfully. This for the Firſt.
               
               § 24. Heare alſo for the ſecond, what we read in the ſame Action. Lucentius reuerend Biſhop, and Vicegerent of the Sea Apoſtolick, ſaid: Firſt, let your Highnes conſider, how guilefully the Biſhops were dealt with, and how haſtily the matter was handled,

that they ſhould be conſtrained to ſubſcribe, contrary to the holy Canons. And Beronicianus, moſt relligious Secretarie of the ſacred Conſiſtorie, interpreting the former ſaying, the Reuerend Biſhops cryed out, None of vs was conſtrained. And after many things between, againe we read: The moſt glorious Iudges ſaid: Theſe, the moſt holy Biſhops of Aſia, and Pontus, that ſubſcribed to the book, as it was read vnto them, let them ſay whether they ſubſcribed of their owne accord, and with full conſent, or compelled by ſome neceſſitie laid vpon them. And the aforeſaid Biſhops of Aſia, and Pontus, that had ſubſcribed, comming foorth into the midſt, Diogenes reuerend Biſhop Cyzici, ſaid, Before God I ſubſcribed willingly. Florentius reuerend Biſhop Sardeorū Lydiae, ſaid, No neceſſitie was laid vpon me, but I ſubſcribed of mine own accord. Romanus reuerend Biſhop Myrorum, ſaid, I was not conſtrained: It ſeemes iuſt to me, and I ſubſcribed willingly. Calogerus reuerend Biſhop Claudiopolis Honoriadis, ſaid, I ſubſcribed with my will, not conſtrained, and according to the determination of the hundred and fiftie holy Fathers [in the firſt Councell of Conſtantinople.] Seleucus Biſhop of Amaſia, ſaid, I did it by mine owne will, deſirous to be vnder this Sea (of Conſtantinople,) becauſe to me it ſeemes good wiſedome. Eleutherius Biſhop of Chalcedon, ſaid, I ſubſcribed by my will, knowing that both by the Canons, and by cuſtome aforegoing, the Sea of Conſtantinople hath theſe priuiledges. Where, by the way, you may ſee how fond the obiection is, that Lucentius then made, and ſome ſince him, that the Canon of Conſtantinople was neuer put in vſe, whereas the Biſhop of the place here, where the Councell was held, alleadges both Canon and Cuſtome for it. Nunechius reuerend Biſhop of Laodicea of Phrygia, I ſubſcribed of mine owne accord. Marinianus, Pergamius, Critonianus, Euſebius, Antiochus, with diuerſe more, too long to be reckoned, profeſſed in the ſame ſort, Sponte ſubſcripſimus, we ſubſcribed willingly, on of our owne accord. What can the Adioyndrer reply to this? And yet afterward more effectually, if it may be, When the glorious Iudges had ſo pronounced, Oportere ſanctiſſimum Archiepiſcopum regiae Conſtantinopolis

nouae Romae, oiſdem primatibus honoris & ipſum dignum eſſe, &c. that the moſt holy Archbiſhop of the royall citie of Conſtantinople, which is new Rome, muſt be allowed the ſame primacies or preheminences of honour, that the Archbiſhop of olde Rome is: and when they deſired the holy and vniuerſall Councell, to declare what they thought, (for ſo are their words in the ſaid Action,) Reuerendi Epiſcopi dixerunt, Haec iuſta ſententia, haec omnes dicimus, haec omnibus placent, &c. The Reuerend Biſhops ſaid, This is a iuſt ſentence, we all ſay ſo, theſe things like vs all, we all ſay ſo (once againe) the decree is iuſt,—and much more to that purpoſe, which I omit.
               § 25.  His third reaſon is, becauſe the other Canon of Conſtantinople, vpon which this was grounded, was neuer put  in practiſe till that time. But how happily haue we refuted that euen now, out of the mouth of one of the Biſhops that ſubſcribed, Eleutherius Biſhop of Chalcedon? Beſides, Baronius confutes him, that acknowledges Chryſoſtome (talem patrem, as he ſaies, ſuch a Father,. i. ſo reuerend) to haue practiſed this Canon, in depoſing no leſſe then 13. Biſhops of Aſia, as you may reade in Sozom. l. 8. c. 16. Likewiſe the Clergie of Conſtantinople, that in this verie Councell, Act. 11. relying on this Canon, challenged to themſelues the ordination of the Biſhop of Epheſus, metropolitane of Aſia minor, and called it Cuſtome, as well as right. So that belike they had knowne it practiſed by others. Laſtly, why did Anatolius ſubſcribe his name in this Councell, the Councel of Chalcedon, before Maximus and Iuuenalis, one Biſhop of Antioch, the other Biſhop of Hieruſalem, but onely becauſe the Canon that was made at Conſtantinople, in fauour of that Sea, was and might be practiſed? And when you quote Leo, Ep. 53. that the Canon of Conſtantinople lacked authoritie, becauſe it was neuer ſent to the Biſhop of Rome, neither does Leo ſay any ſuch thing, that I can finde in all that Epiſtle, nor ſhall you prooue that the Popes conſent is neceſſarie to enact Canons, though moſt childiſhly you preſume it: and laſtly, he rather yeeldeth in the ſaid Epiſtle, as I conceiue him, quandam tranſmiſſam huius rei noticiam

ad Apoſtolicam ſedem à praedeceſſoribus Anatolij, that Anatolius his predeceſſors ſent knowledge hereof to the Romane Sea, and in the Epiſt. 55. he graunts that ſome might haue attempted is, (which without Canon ſurely they would not in all likelihood) but could not obtaine it, he meanes perhaps, not ſo fully as afterward. Elſe wee prooued you know euen nowe, that the Canon was not buried for want of practiſe, ſome while afore. Neither can I tell, what thoſe words of Euſebius meane, in the 16. Act of this Councel: 
                  And I my ſelfe read ouer this Canon, to the moſt

               § 26.  Your fourth and laſt reaſon why Leo ſhould diſallow  this, becauſe it was repugnant to the Canons of Nice, is a very trifling one, and you anſwer it your ſelfe, in the 28. and 70. Numb. of this Chapter, graunting that he might haue ratified it for all that. And I hope, if the Canons of Nice had beene ſo inviolable, it concerned Maximus, and Iuuenalis, the two Patriarks, one of Antioch, the other of Hieruſalem, to looke to the keeping of them, as well as Leo. Yet they yeelded. So much of this.
               § 27. Is there any thing elſe to be ſifted in this chapter? It ſticks ſore in his ſtomack, that the Biſhop finds a difference betweene the back-ſides of letters, and the decrees of generall Councels. Becauſe I know not who, ſome miſerable ſuiters, had magnified Leo with glorious titles to mooue compaſſion. Mr. F. T. demands, why did not thoſe ſuiters, that indorſed their ſupplications after ſuch a faſhion to Leo, rather magnify the Councell, and flatter that, if the Councels authority was greater then Leos?

Contradiction needed not, where the ſtyle of beggars carried no validitie, and the Councell eft-ſoones controuled thoſe tearms, in the Canon that we ſpeak of, vnleſſe well conſtrued and dextrouſly vnderſtood. So the Patriarko Alexandrine at this day, in his loweſt ebbes, writes himſelfe the Iudge of the world, which ſome ſay S. Cyrill deſerued for himſelfe, and his ſucceſſors in that throne, for playing the Preſident ſo well in the Epheſine Councell: and the rule is not vnknowne, which teaches vs how to interpret ſuch manner of phraſes, Loquendum vt vulgus, ſentiendum vt pauci, or, vt ſapientes; the one like Iſchyrion, and his diſtreſſed mates, the other after the ordinance of the ſacred Councell.

So Cyrill, ſo Atticus, call them their ſonnes, whom Epiſtad Concil. the African Councell ſent for copies of the Nicene Canons to them; Innocentius the Prieſt, and Marcellus the ſubdeacon, though they were not of their Dioceſſe, but toto diuiſi orbe

Dauid eals himſelf Nabals ſon, yet ſo far from acknowledging any authoritie that the churle had ouer him, as he threatens him the ſword ſoone after, in the ſame chap. rather. And, I pray you, does not Marcian call Palladius father, Palladi Pater? (See Sacra Marciani, poſt Concil.

Not farre off from the ſame place, the Biſhops of Aegypt writing to Anatolius, entitle him thus, Archiepiſcopo Conſtantinopolitanae & Catholicae Eccleſiae Anatolio, as if beſides his Archbiſhopricke of Conſtantinople, he had beene Biſhop of the Vniuerſall Church of Chriſt, as you wildly faine of the Pope, that he hath the whole Church put into his hands, together with the Biſhopricke of the citie of Rome; as if the skuller of Rome, forſooth, or the herring-boat rather, cymba Petri, had the ſhip of the whole world appendant to it. Proterius in the ſame Epiſtle, Biſhop of Alexandria, is thus ſtyled by them: Archiepiſcopus, & Catholicae paſtor Eccleſiae, which inſinuates as much, too much I know for a Ieſuit to graunt, without diſcreeter interpretation, Gregorie Nazianzenes

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , father of all the high Prieſts of God. Of him in Baronius I told you before, Pontificum

                      caput, the head of Biſhops, yea of Popes verily. That our Sauiour committed the charge of the vineyard to Leo, as is there ſaid, as if therefore his ſupremacie were de iure diuine, is no more then Palladius, (another Chriſtian Magiſtrate of that name)

beſtowes vpon Epiphanius in his Epiſtle to him, before the Anchoratus, Dignare ad hoc à Saluatore ordinatus, vouchſafe O thou appointed for this ende by our Sauiour, and what to doe, trow you? to preſcribe rules of the right faith in the Trinitie, which yet was not Epiphanius his taske, de iure diuino, the Popes rather, as they I am ſure would haue it, Aquinas by name, in his 2. 2. to giue Creedes to the church; And a quaeſt. 1. art. 10. little before that, in a ſtranger tune, as ſpeaking to our bleſſed Sauiour, Praeceptor ſerua, Maſter ſaue vs. Is not this rather a pylot of the vniuerſall ſhip?
               § 30. Whereas Dioſcorus fault is amplified by the Fathers, to haue wronged Leo after Flauianus and Euſebius, 
                  Leo before all, becauſe reckoned after all. with a poſt haec omnia, as if therfore Leo were aboue them all, though we deny not but in order of place he was aboue thē, and ſpecially then, when he was Preſident of the Councell, (of which neuertheles we may ſay with S. Chryſoſtome vpon the Acts, homil. 3. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a matter of preſidence rather then of precedence) yet he might as well argue, that to impriſon Peter was a greater fault in Herod, then to ſlay Iames, (and indeede thats the reckening that the Papiſts make of theſe names now a daies, I meane Kings and Popes, the one in Iames, the other in Peter, yea though they flay the one, and but empriſon the other) becauſe the ſcripture ſaies 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , he added moreouer, or, he proceeded alſo, 
                  Act. 12. 2. 3. to attach Peter. Though F. T. perhaps, drunken with Ieſuitiſme, would argue from hence for Peters primacie, as catching at euery thing, and ſurely as wiſely as Turrian his fellow Ieſuite, from the 4. quaternions of ſouldiers that were ſet to guard him, in the ſame Chapter, an vniuerſall man no doubt, and ſpreading into the foure corners of the world. Another time, quia vas pertigit ad Petrum, the veſſell came iuſt as farre as Peter, that is, the Church and the Pope are coextending.
               § 31. But his greateſt ſtick, is at the Biſhops anſwer, about the charge of the vineyard, committed to Leo, that ad curam omnium ex aquo pertinet, the care of the vineyard belongs

to all alike, not to Leo onely. And here he plunges into a diſcourſe ouer head and eares, that all are not equally obliged in conſcience, to take care for the Church. As if the Biſhop had ſaid, aequaliter pertinet, or aequè pertinet, that all are bound in like degree, who onely ſaies, ad omnes pertinet ex aequo, that is, that all are bound and none exempt, to take care for the Church; ex aequo pointing there to the indifferency of the care, the generality of the parties, not to the degrees of caring.
               § 32. Yet he argues from hence (that you may know the man, and what his humour his) that if this be true, then coblers and tinkers ſhall haue as good right of ſuffrage in generall Councels, as any Biſhop of them all. Yea nothing but confuſion and Chaos will ouerflow, the difference of vocations beeing extinguiſhed in the Church, &c. As if firſt the Biſhop meant this of the Laity, ſuch as coblers and tinkers, and not of Biſhops only and other Clergie-men, which afterwards himſelfe is faine to acknowledge, num, 86. with ſhame enough, hauing beaten the aire ſo long before to no purpoſe. Or, if the Biſhop ſhould extend it to the Laity, and all, (for diſputation ſake, and to chafe this ſnarling maſtiffe a little,) yet it were not eaſie to put off all that he brings, by this diſtinctiō, that howſoeuer the care as exiens in actum, breaking forth into this or ſome other duty, is not common to all, as the nurſe onely cares ſo for the childe as to ſuckle it, yet the care in fonte, or in radice, the originall ſollicitude and indiſtinct care, is common to all, as they ſay in the Pſalmes, Wee haue wiſhed you good lucke, you that be of the houſe of the Lord: euen as they may wiſh wel to the childe, that are not particularly put in truſt to battle it, and to giue it ſuck, but cuſtod

of Peter, and the priuiledges of the Sea of Rome. So he. And what of this? Therefore the Fathers might giue the priuiledges indeed, as the Canon ſpeakes, but ſtill the primacie is of Chriſt. What primacie, Sir, what primacie, I pray you, but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  ▪ to be aduanced and magnified in Church-matters, to be Ladie-regent and gouernreſſe in that quarter? What primacie did our Sauiour els giue to your Church, when he gaue moſt, as you feigne in Peter? Vnleſſe you ſpeake of the Temporall, which neuertheleſſe you make a

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is called here priuiledges, by the Fathers of this Councell, and it is ſaide, the Fathers gaue it afore to Rome, and now to Conſtantinople, by the tenour of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , vnleſſe you will teach the Fathers how to ſpeake. Which deuiſe of yours, when I thinke of it, is as good as that before, numb. 59. that the Fathers gaue not all priuiledges to Rome, but ſome onely, and therefore the Biſhop offended in his ſi qua, that is, all in generall, or whatſoeuer. Which you correct thus, The Canon ſpeakes only of priuiledges giuen to the Church of Rome, in reſpect of the Imperiall ſeat. So that whereas the Fathers of Calchedon bring this for an argument, why their fathers and predeceſſors gaue priuiledges to Rome, namely becauſe Rome was the Imperiall ſeat, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the conſtruction muſt be thus, by your grand Logick, The Fathers gaue not all priuiledges to Rome, for the ſeat Imperiall, but the priuiledges giuen thereto, in respect of the Imperiall ſeat, were giuen thereto in respect of the Imperiall ſeat, and none others. Is not this ſweete art now, and worthie of a Ieſuit?
               § 35. The reaſons that you bring, why the Councell ſhould not mention the prerogatiue of Peter, becauſe it would hinder Anatolius his cauſe, and the preferment of Conſtantinople, which was then intended, doe they not ſhew, that either the Fathers were damnably partiall, to obſcure the true cauſe of Romes aduancement, or elſe that Peter was no cauſe thereof at all? For ſay not, it helped not to

the cauſe in hand. The Fathers were not ſo blind, as not to ſee it; much leſſe ſo groſſe, as ſeeing to ſmother it, or for deſire to winne their cauſe, to tranſlate it cleane another way. And ſuppoſe they would haue done ſo, why did no bodie contradict them, as you ſaid a little before, about the titles of Supplications? When there were negatiues in the Councell, qui non ſubſcripſerunt, as we read in the 16. Action: why did no bodie lay forth the lameneſſe of their reaſon, and drawe Peter from vnder the ſtuffe? Once againe, me thinkes, an Angel ſhould haue ſmote him on the ſide, and bid him ſtand vp now if euer. For the Fathers had buried his prerogatiue cleane, and entitled the dignitie of Rome to the Empire, as if the Empire authoriſed the Church, not the Church the Empire. No reply was made, none found fault with the reaſon. Therefore wee take you at your word, num. 67. That the mention of Peters primacie, does not onely not helpe, but euen croſſe this Canon. If the Canon then be good, Peters primacie is none.
               § 36. That Leo excommunicated Dioſcorus by the Synode, reſtraines his power of excommunicating Patriarchs, rather then eſtabliſhes it. You know it was a queſtion, whether the Pope might inflict cenſures promiſcue, without a Synod, yea or no. Of which more Gelaſius in his Epiſtle before cited, ad Epiſcopos Dardaniae. And yet Leo does nothing here, but by the Synod, & re, & ſtylo, directly mentioning it, (his Legates I meane for him,) fetching aſſiſtance from it. And Peter is put in the laſt place, after Leo and the Synode, as Leo

Yet Leo was the rather praiſed, becauſe Preſident of the aſſembly, and to his face, alſo enioying the grace that accompanieth Councells: Athanaſius in his particular, and after death, and not onely at one time, but continuedly. And, I pray you, what ſaies the ſame Coū
                  cell of the Emperours, Leo by name, but not your Leo? Leo

Leo our Emperor, the impregnable garlād & honour of the faith, hath receiued of him (that is, of God) power ouer all men, without any controule. We ſee here for matters of faith, and of relligion, what the Emperour might challenge, beeing called the garland of it, and impregnable, or inuincible. 2. He hath command ouer all men, Clerks and all. 3. from God. 4. without any checke or controule, which would haue made great titles in the Popes ſtyle.

               § 38. The laſt thing that I will note in your ſecond chapter,

ſhall be this, remembring my promiſe to obſerue breuity, from which I am but too eaſily blowne awry, with the ſtorme of your fopperies.
               You make it an argument of Leos ſupremacie, (you call it Monarchie very roundly a little after, and are not aſhamed at it, chap. 4. num. 3.) that, firſt Leo was admitted Preſident of the Councell held in Greece: then, that Leo beeing abſent, Anatolius kept not his place, but Legates of his owne ſending, whereof one was a Prieſt. The anſwer is moſt eaſie. Leo beeing denied one part of his will, to haue the Councell in Italy, it was a poore recompence (I meane for his monarchie, and in regard to that) to be employed to be their Preſident, as a wiſe man, a learned man, and a ſtout man, likewiſe alſo in order ſurmounting them all, as hath beene acknowledged, whereas diuerſe Preſidents had beene in Councels, that were inferiour to Leo in theſe points, and therefore much more remooued from the ſtately Monarchy, that you from hence gather.
               § 39. But, Why not Anatolius? ſay you. Was not hee fit to be Preſident, whome the Councell thought fit to be ſo aduanced in their Canon, as to haue the like ſtroke in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, that the verie firſt of the ranke had? Once againe I muſt tell you belike, that the Canon aduances not Anatolius, but Conſtantinople. And it was the parting of ſtakes betweene Leo and him, that though the Councell were in Greece, yet Leo ſhould be the Preſident. As for his Legates, it was no matter, (after once they had concurred vpon Leo to bee the man) whome he ſent in his place, ſo long as they were ſufficient, ſince himſelfe could not be there. And I hope they brought inſtructions From Leo, as themſelues ſay often, and might haue reference to him, if any doubt ſhould ariſe. Alſo it was the fitter, that Italian Biſhops ſhould be Preſidents, and not Grecian, that the Canon might be the authenticaller, which was enacted for Conſtantinople, as farther from partialitie of the lawmakers. To which purpoſe they ſay, in their Epiſtle to Leo, (the Fathers of that Councell) that

the Emperours affecting the exaltation of Conſtantinople, Volebant celebrari & ab vniuerſali Concilio, for more authoritie ſake no doubt, and ſo likewiſe by forraine Biſhops, as Leo and his Legates. But if you thinke his Legates had any ſuch ſtroke, that Anatolius ſhould enuy them for their greatneſſe, you may remember, how boldly the Councell diſſented from them, and the Canon was confirmed, notwithſtanding their demurres.

Whereas the Cardinall had ſaid, that Cyprian makes Peter the head, the roote, and the fountaine of the Church, the Biſhop moſt truly and ſoundly anſwered, not Peter of the Church, but the Church her ſelfe head of the members belonging to her, roote of the branches ſhooting out of her, fountaine of the waters iſſuing forth from her, &c. one in ſubſtance, but many in propagation, which is no new thing in this myſterie, or in any ſuch bodie, as the Philoſophers call deiuncta corpora, riſing of many moities into one

                     . Plut. ſumme. Nay laſtly, S. Cyprian, to ſhew whome he ſpeakes of, calls her matrem, mother, in plaine tearmes, which is not mother Peter, but the Church ſaies the Biſhop. And this ſo vexes the gall of our Ieſuit, as you would not thinke. For indeede what more compendious victorie could there be, inſomuch as F. T. is faine to ſay, that Cyprian had no occaſion Numb. 7. hulus. to name Peter there, but the Church onely; like the Rhemiſts annotation vpon 16. to the Rom. that Peter was out of towne, when he ſhould haue beene ſaluted by Paul; ſo we muſt beleeue, iuſt there the occaſion failed of naming Peter, whereas in all the other current he onely is meant. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as S. Chryſoſtome ſaies moſt excellently,

                  , Epiſt. 190. ad Pentadiam Diaconiſſam. Such a thing is truth, in one ſhort word ſhee confutes the cauiller, and ſtops his mouth. For the words, lying thus as they doe in Cyprian, Ʋnum tamen caput eſt, & origo vna, & vna mater foecunditatis ſucceſſibus copioſa, yet the head is but one, the ſpring but one, the mother but one, plenteous in her bleſſed and happie fruitfulneſſe, who can imagine, that Peter is the head here, and the church the mother, and not rather that the whole ſentence belongs but to one, whether that be Peter, or the Church, or whoſoeuer? For as the ſentence runnes on in an euen line, ſo doubtleſſe it comprehends but one and the ſame ſubiect. But Peter is not the mother, as F. T. confeſſes. Therefore neither the head, nor the ſpring; nor any thing els. And indeede ſo it followes in S. Cyprian, Illius foetu naſcimur, illius lacto nutrimur, illius ſpiritu animamur, ſhee breeds vs, feedes vs, and enliues vs, which may well be vnderſtood of the Church our mother, but of whome elſe, whether Peter, or any other, I ſee not, I confeſſe, I; S. Auſten ſo, lib. 2. contra Creſcon. Grammat. c. 35. & 36. and againe, l. 3. contra eundem, c. 58. & 65. vnderſtands theſe words, quoting S. Cyprian, not of Peter, but of the Church. And I meane the words de fonte & riuo, de ſole & radio, that I may fetch it as high as F. T. himſelfe, euen from the place where, if any where, S. Cyprian ſpeakes of Peter, by his owne acknowledgement. And Pamelius, their owne author, commenting vpon S. Cyprian, though he greedily drawe all aduantages that may be, from other places of this Father, to eſtabliſh the Popedome, yet paſſes this ouer in deepe ſilence, as nothing fauouring their deſired Headſhip, nay croſſing it rather. For he had read immediately before, in the ſame place, Hoc erant vti

                      & eaeteri Apoſtoli quod fuit Petrus, pari conſortio praediti & honoris & poteſtatis. i. The reſt of the Apoſtles were vtterly the ſame that Peter was, endewed with equall fellowſhip both of honour and power. Where by the way we may note S. Ambroſe and S. Cyprian their agreement about

this point, not onely for matter, but for words. For ſo Ambroſe before quoted, Hoc erant quod Paulus: and here Cyprian, Hoc erant quod Petrus. As if there were no diffe
                     •…
                   neither betweene Peter and Paul, nor betweene the other Apoſtles and them both. For quae alicui tertio vna ſunt, inter ſe quo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      vna, or aequalia, ſaies the light of nature. Will you know then, why he makes mention of Peter in ſingular? Sed exordium ab vnitate proficiſcitur, vt eccleſia Chriſti vna monſtretur. But the beginning proceedes from vnity, or from one man, to ſhew that the Church of Chriſt is but one. How does the beginning proceede from one, but as S. Auſten ſhewes in the place before quoted, Onely Peter was ſpoken De verb. Dom. 13. to, that others beeing not excluded, yet this pretious vnitie might be commended in one? As we read vnder Salomon, that the people were all like one man, and Act. 2. in the firſt times of the new Teſtament, the people were all of one heart and one minde. Where by the way you ſee, how Salomon prefigured Chriſt, and thoſe times theſe latter with ſtrange accordance. And if this become the people, how much more the paſtors, or the maſter builders, that they ſhould all ſet to their worke like one man? To which nothing can be more contrary then the Popiſh vſurpation, ouer-bearing other paſtors, which neuertheles they would ground vpon theſe places for vnity. S. Cyprian alſo declares his owne meaning in the ſame place, to be as I haue ſaid, in theſe words. Quamnis omnibus Apoſtolis parem tribuit poteſtatem, though our Sauiour gaue equall power to all his Apoſtles, tamen vt manifeſtaret vnitatem, diſpoſuit originem eius ab vno incipientem, yet to ſhew the vnity (ſo he conſtrues monſtretur, not as if that Church could be pointed to with the finger; from whence other Churches receiue their vnity, as F. T. may imagine) but, vt manifeſtaret vnitatem, to make knowne the vnity of the Catholicke body, and that the Church is but one congregation of the faithfull, though branched and billetted out into ſundry parcells, he tooke order that her originals ſhould beginne at one, which is ſhort

of authority, and much more of ſupremacie, but moſt of all of the monarchy, that the Ieſuites would crowne Peter with, by vertue of this place. And when the ſame Cyprian, a very few lines afore the words laſt alleaged, makes this to be the cauſe of abuſes in the Church, quòd ad veritatis originem non reditur, nec caput quaeritur, nec magiſtricoele ſtis doctrina ſeruatur, what is plainer, then that by caput (which they ſo catch at) he meanes nothing elſe but the originall verity, which our Sauiour Chriſt firſt deliuered, euen that ſame Sic ab initio, as both origo veritatis, & doctrina coeleſtis magiſtri declares, which encompaſſe the word Caput like two torches of both ſides of it, to giue light vnto it, that we miſtake it not. Then followes his commendation of Church-vnity, the onely remedy in Cyprians iudgement againſt the aforeſaid maladies, which hauing taught to be figured by our Sauiour in S. Peter, whome in equall priuiledges of power with the reſt, he called from the reſt, to patterne that vertue, he amplifies from other places the authority of the Church, as vna eſt columba mea, Cant. 6. vnum corpus, and vnus ſpiritus, vna fides, Epheſ. 4. with, Qui eccleſiae reſiſtit, quomodo ſe in eccleſiâ eſſe confidit? and after a notable enforcement to the preſeruing of vnity from vnus Epiſcopatus eſt, there is but one Biſhoprick throughout the whole Church, which euery Biſhop hath his ſolide ſhare in, and, Qui in eccleſiâ praeſident, which are chiefe in the Church, ſhewing that many Biſhops gouerne the Church, and not one Biſhop alone, as the Papiſts would haue it, he returnes to eccleſia, Eccleſia vna eſt, quae in multitudine latiùs incremento faecunditatis extenditur, &c. and yet againe more cloſely, after certaine protaſes of ſimilitudes, which F. T. ſaies the Biſhop durſt not lay downe for fraud, but himſelfe laying downe gets nothing but hatred for his abominable tediouſneſſe, Eccleſia Domini luce perfuſa (ſaies he) per orbem totum radios ſuos porrigit, vnum tamen lumen eſt, ramos ſuos extendit, riuos expandit, vnum tamen caput eſt, & origo vna, & vna mater, &c. That is: The Church repleniſhed with the light of

our Lord, ſtretches her beames through all the world, yet the light is but one, (F. T. would haue Peter to be this light, as if the Church were but rayes, and he the body of the ſun, which S. Cyprian neuer meant, but for more perſpicuity ſake calls it Domini lucem, our Lords light, vnleſſe Peter be that Lord too) reaches out her branches, ſpreads her riuers; yet the head is but one, the ſpring but one, and the mother (her ſelfe) but one, abounding in fruitfulneſſe, &c. So as one may wonder that F. T. after ſo manifeſt conuiction, would perſiſt to force this clauſe vpon Peter, which ſo properly and ſo immediately belongs to the Church, but that it fretted both him and the Cardinall too, not a little, to be taken tripping ſo fowly, as to make Peter a mother, or the Pope a woman once againe: and he hath no ſhift but to ſay, that S. Cyprian in one and the ſame tenure of vndiuided connexion, meanes the firſt part of Peter, and the latter part of the Church, like Virgils monſter:
—in Priſtin' deſinit aluus.
               
               § 2. Here is alſo to be noted, that F. T. citing that ſentence of S. Cyprian, tamen vt vnitatem manifeſtaret, &c. foiſts in thoſe words, which are not to be found in the printed copies, vt vna cathedra monſtretur, at leaſt not in Morel. edit. of Cyprian praiſed before all other by Alan.

And yet this is the man, that challenges the Biſhop for corrupting of Fathers. And farther he prints thoſe words, one Chayre, in an eminent letter, to giue credit to his coſenage, one Church in an ordinarie, becauſe though that be Cyprians, yet nothing to his purpoſe, num. 5. of this third chap. How beit, if vna cathedra were read in Cyprian, it is not the Popes chaire, but anſwerable to that of which he ſaid a little before, Epiſcopatus vnus eſt, &c. there is but one Biſhoprick in the Church, and yet ſuch a one, as euery Biſhop hath his full ſhare therein. For as the Biſhoprick, ſo the Chayre. With like honeſtie he peruerts the words of Cyprian, exordium ab vnitate proficiſcitur, by either adding to them, or tranſlating

them in this frantick faſhion, num. 4. The primacie is giuen to Peter, whereof not a word that we find here in Cyprian. And he tells vs, we heard before that Cyprian ſaies our Sauiour built his Church vpon Peter; which for my part, I neither heard nor read yet in S. Cyprian de vnitate Eccleſiae, of which worke now the queſtion onely is. What he ſaies ad Quintum, comes not to be examined till his 12. numb. But thus he muſt patch one thing with another, that cries out againſt falſhood in all men els, as the onely Doue. And the toyle is more to recken vp his leud corruptions, then the taske to cleere the Biſhop from thoſe things, which he imputes to him in that very kind. Laſtly, for a taſt of his learning, as well as his ſinceritie, he conſtrues robur vnum, in S. Cyprians compariſon, one ſtrength. Multi rami, ſed robur vnum: Many boughes, but one ſtrength. Neither giuing vs the ſenſe of S. Cyprians ſimilitude, but vtterly ſmothering it, like a faithfull alleadger, and forgetting Virgil, Aeneid. 2.—Roboribus textis—. yea, his very Accidents,

               § 3. Now in the epiſtle ad Quintum, what find we? Petrus quem primùm Dominus elegit, &, ſuper quem aedificauit eccleſiam ſuam. As if one of theſe did not expound the other. For our Sauiour is ſaid to haue built his Church vpon Peter, in that he choſe him firſt, not choſe him to be firſt, primùm 
                  Conſtar ex Mat. 4. 18. Nec obſtat, Iohan. 1. 41. vt periti explicant Vide Maldonat.
                   
                  elegit, not elegit in primatem, as preuenting him with the promiſe, and honouring him with the exhibition of the keyes before the reſt. For they were deliuered to him in the generall name, as ſignifying vnitie, as both S. Auſten, and S. Cyprian haue taught before, ſo as the reſt notwithſtanding had as full right in them as euer Peter had; which S. Cyprian declares, when he ſaies, Pariconſortio praediti poteſtatis, endued with like fellowſhip of power; and, Hoc erant caeteri quod Petrus, the reſt were the ſame that Peter was. S. Auſten alſo in thoſe words of his cited before, but of neceſſitie to be brought to your remembrance, I ſee, euer and anon, There are ſome things, which though they were ſpoken to 
                  In Pſal. 108.
                  
                  Peter, yet can make no good conſtruction, vnleſſe they be referred to the Church in generall, and he inſtances in that, Tibi dabo claues. As for the building of the Church vpon Peter, howſoeuer ſome writer may ſay ſo in his ſenſe, yet you neede not be ignorant, how the moſt ſort conſtrue it, to be a building vpon his faith, not vpon his perſon: Super petram quam confeſſus es,. i. ſuper meipſum.

To which Biſhop the aſſaults were ſo fiercely giuen, as if his ouerthrow would haue been the Captiuitie of the right faith (they are the Hiſtorians words) and in him were all. But he manfully withſtood, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . For he remained vpon the impregnable rocke of faith, Iuvenalis Biſhop of Hieruſalem, with fiue more Biſhops, in Reſcripto Synodico, in Concil Calched, ad preſbyteros & monachos Paleſtina Prouincia, hauing quoted the words of the Goſpel aforeſaid, inferres thus, . i. Vpon this confeſſion the Church of God is eſtabliſhed. 
                  Super hanc confeſſionem roborata eſt eccleſia Dei. Where by the way you may ſee, what the opinion was of the Fathers of that Councell, concerning thoſe words, Super hanc petram, to ſettle the cheifedome in Rome, as before you would beare vs downe, though they deriue the priuiledges of it meerely from the Empire, and the graunt of their aunceſtors. Alſo the Biſhops ſurmiſe remaines good, that the Cardinall left out thoſe other words in Cyprian, as preiudiciall to his cauſe, that Peter did not challenge to himſelfe any thing inſolently or arrogantly, as to ſay he had the primacie. You ſay, he might haue ſaid ſo, in his full right, but S. Cyprian
                  
calls it, an inſolent, and an arrogant challenge, by which you ſee, that primacie whatſoeuer it was, was not of authoritie, but of meere ſenioritie, like primùm elegit, a little before (euen Andrewes firſt reſorting to our Sauiours ſchoole hinders not this, ſith there was duplex vocatio, as Maldonate will ſhew you, before quoted) which the words following ſhew too, Et obtemperari à nouellis ac poſteris ſibi potiùs oportere, comparing Paul the later called, with Peter aunciently deſigned to the Apoſtleſhip. In one reſpect an 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , or an abortiue, as himſelfe confeſſes, and yet in other reſpects nothing ſhort of the cheife. S. Auſten alſo, though hee alter S. Cyprians words, lib. 2. de bap. c. 1. as is ſoone done in allegations of memorie, yet he keeps the ſenſe, and fauours you nothing; the primatus Apoſtolorum excellenti gratiâ praeeminens, ſtanding in dignity or qualitie, (let the word gratia helpe to perſwade you) not in authoritie. Yet wee haue principes Apoſtolorum, Paul and Peter, nothing ſo common in your owne mens mouthes: yea Cardinal Pole ſayes, both their Apoſtleſhips grewe into one: Amborum Apoſtolatus in vnum coaluit: lib. 3. ad Henrie. 8. &c. So as either no monarchie nowe, or of more then one, a thing meerely impoſſible.
               § 4. That you quote out of S. Auſten concerning Peter, 
                  l. 2. de Bapt. c. 1. 
                  Peter did otherwiſe then the truth required, yea and in ſo great a point as was Circumciſiō, alſo afterward more plainly in the ſame num. 14. that he erred: would you euer write thus, if you were well in your wits, ſtriuing for Peters primacie, to impute errour to him, and errour in faith, which you know cannot be, without the grand perill of the vniuerſall Church? As S. Gregorie ſayes, that all fall, if vnus vniuerſalis 
                  Lib. 6. cp. 24. fall, one in whome are all, as you in your Pope, euen as the moile ſtumbling, all goes to wracke that the beaſt caries, and the greater the beaſt, the fouler the wrack, whether it be gold or ſiluer, or what other fraight foeuer. And I pray you, what does your primacie ſerue for, vnles it be ioyned with infallibity? Yet you forfeit the one here, to

winne the other.
               § 5. I might likewiſe aske you what manner of primacy you call that, which excuſes not the ſuperiour from the iuſt and lawfull rebuke of his inferiour, but ſo as if S. Peter ſhould haue refuſed to follow, and to obey S. Paul, (they are your owne words, num. 16.) he ſhould haue done inſolently. Call you that a primacy, ſpecially a Popiſh one, which muſt be patient of controule, liable to the obedience, euen of his vnderling, if it will avoyd pride?
               § 6. And therefore thought the Biſhop in his vſuall modeſty, ſay, as you note (numb. 16.) videtur mens Cypriano fuiſſe, it ſeemes Cyprian was of the minde, it is not for diffidence Sir, but as I told you. Videtur and eſt is all one with the Philoſopher, ſaies Zimaras in his Table, quoting the Commentor for it, And ſo the Lawyers. If there be fraud in videtur, it is rather in Bellarmines, De Pontif. Rom. l. 1. c. 9. Indicare videtur Apoſtolus ad Heb. 8. What? that the Church triumphant is a patterne of the militant; where there may be videtur, but no eſt certenly, becauſe there is no ſuch thing in the Apoſtles text. You might rather haue thought of that, Luke, 22. 24. Quis videretur eſſe maior, where if videretur be not better conſtrued, your primacy is but a 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a very fancie.
               § 7. I am aſhamed of thus digreſſing: but your dealing forces me, I cannot forbeare; yet with this I will end concerning Cyprian. To your 17. numb. whereas the Biſhop ſaies, Fundamentum, ſed non vnicum, what more confonant to Scripture? not Apoc. 24. as you quote it, but 21. v. 14. where there are 12. ſpecified. But againe, whereas he ſaies, There is caput vnicum, and therefore non ſequitur à fundamento ad caput; what more agreeable to ſenſe? For, as for that you adde 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and with a mouth ſpeaking bigge, which Anna forbids, 1. Sam. 2. 3. that as the 12. to Chriſt, ſo the eleuen to Peter, were enterchangeably ſubordinate, you ſhould ſhew this written humano ſtylo, either in Scripture, or in Father, that we might runne and

read it. But though you ſweat your heart out, it growes not there. Yet you ſeeme to your ſelfe wiſe, when you ſhew the Biſhop as well many heads vpon one body, as many foundations of one building. Videlicet, ſay you, the ſtates of Venice, ſo many ſtates, ſo many heads of that commonwealth. Which firſt is harſh in Ariſtocraty, to make euery gouernour a ſeuerall head (more then the Amphiſbaena hath) the whole company rather, and many men if you will, but one head. Yet this fonder, that the Biſhop arguing from a materiall houſe, not a metaphoricall, and from a naturall bodie not a proportionall, to demonſtrate what is meet to bee expected in the myſticall, you ſhew him a politicall, which is nothing to his demand.
               § 8. NExt of S. Hierome. And why might not the Biſhop taxe the Cardinall, for ſuppreſſing S. Hieromes words, as well as before S. Cyprians? As well (ſay you) the one as the other, that is iuſt neither, or neither iuſtly. But of Cyprian we haue ſeene, ſee we now of Hierome. Inter duodecim vnus eligitur, vt capite conſtituto, ſchiſmatis tolleretur occaſio. Amongſt twelue, one is choſen, that a Head beeing appointed, occaſion of ſchiſme might be taken away. lib. 1. in Iovin. But in the ſame booke (ſaies the Biſhop) Hierome thus, which the Cardinall would take no notice of. But thou wilt ſay, that the Church is built vpon Peter. (What then?) though the ſame in another place be done vpon all, [that is, the Church is ſaid to be built vpon all the Apoſtles,] and all to receiue the Keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the ſtrength of the Church to be equally grounded vpon them all. Yet indeede one is choſen among the twelue, that a Head beeing appointed, occaſion of ſchiſme might be cut off. Is this no cooling card to the other authoritie? For you that tell vs of dice, I may doe well to ſpeake to you in a ſutable metaphore, and not abhorring from your trade. As the Philoſophers ſay, the braine in a mans bodie, tempers the heat of the heart beneath; ſo doe not the words precedent allay the force of theſe latter, which

yet the Cardinall onely ſet before vs? For the threefold equalitie, which S. Hierome before aſcribed to all the Apoſtles, one of their equall intereſt in the foundation, another in the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the third, which is reiterated for deeper impreſſion, of bearing the whole ſtrength, or ſtreſſe of the Church, leaues onely now this ſenſe of caput, that Peter was choſen to haue ſuch a kind of Headſhip, that is, of prioritie among the twelue, as ſhould not derogate from paritie, and yet exclude ſchiſme or garboyle, or confuſion. Which is the primacie of order that we haue often told you of, and you would faine diuert to a primacie of Maieſtie. I could not anſwer your fallacie in a directer faſhion, yet I know you haue replies, as that caput in the laſt place, addes great force, to, ſuper quem fundata eſt, in the firſt. Which we remit to the iudgement of the indifferent Reader, whether ſo many equalities yeelded to the Apoſtles, in the words afore, doe not rather force vs, to conſtrue caput as hath beene ſayd, not derogating from the equality of their power in the keyes, nor from bearing the groundworke of the Church ioyntly: that is, as you conſtrue it, from beeing gouernours thereof. Beſides that Caput is onely a borrowed word, and ſignifies primum, or the firſt in that kinde, (which we grant to Peter with all readines) and laſtly tempered with ſuch a modeſt clauſe, to keepe out ſchiſme or diſorder onely.
               § 9. You ſay, there is more daunger of ſchiſme nowe, then among the twelue. For they were confirmed by ſpeciall grace, we not ſo. And therefore they were not ſo likely to runne into ſchiſme, for which they ſhould haue a head. As though Paul and Barnabas were not running into a Act. 15. 39. ſchiſme, a paroxyſme at leaſt, that is the firſt grudging of the other ague; as though when Peter confirmed his brethren, & tu confirma, Luk. 22. 32. they had the leſſe vſe of him, as their head, againſt a ſchiſme. And though the will of God be to confirme ſome here, yet not without meanes, neither at firſt to rectifie them, nor afterward to

continue them in their good courſe, to the ende. Of which meanes this might be one, of which S. Hierome ſpeakes. Was any man more confirmed then S. Paul? rapt into the third heauen, &c. yet he ſtruggles with his nature, leaſt preaching to others, he ſhould be a reprobate himſelfe. So here. Beſides that this ſchiſme, which our Sauiour preuented, by appointing an Head, as S. Hierome ſaies, might be ſchiſma populorum, not Apoſtolorum, and therefore he ſaies, vt occaſio ſchiſmat is tolleretur; that the Chriſtian people ſeeing who was eminent in the Colledge of the Apoſtles, might not euery one raſhly ſet vp their principall, and ſo fall into ſchiſme.
               § 10. But at leaſt we neede a Head now a daies, as much as they. As if we haue not our Head in our manifold regiments, Dedit quoſdam paſtores, Eph. 4. &, Obedite praepoſitis. Hebr. 13. &, Terribilis ſicut caſtrorum acies ordinata, and ſo forth. Is there no Head but of an vniuerſall Biſhop? yea, theirs was of order onely, and to ſhun confuſion, ours of power, and commands ſubiection. Beſides What a ſweete ſuppreſſor of ſchiſmes the Pope is, may appeare by that of Innocent. 7. who ſlew eleuen perſons, endeauouring to ſuccour the ſtate of their country, running to decay, and caſt their bodies out at a window, ſaying, That was the way to ſuppreſſe ſchiſmes, and no other. Plat. Innocent 7. Catilines quenching of fire, non aqua, ſed rui

Auſten often, but namely contra Gaudent. l. 1. c. 25.
               § 11. For where you tell vs that Princes may cauſe theſe ſchiſmes themſelues, and ſo contemning ſpirituall cenſure and proceedings, muſt either be hampered with another coerciue power, extending to bodies, and to eſtates, or els all runne to nothing, and the Church be cleane extinguiſhed, you bewray your ſpirit ſufficiently, and a man may read your drifts in your forehead, which at another time you would ſo faine couer and ſmooth ouer; Sermo tuus indicat te, may be our ſpeech to the Pſeudo-Peter, as was once to the true. Doe you thinke then, that S. Hierome would giue

Though of you I leſſe wonder, if you giue them iron in their chaynes, to whome you haue giuen it in their crownes, as Clement to Charles, if Platina ſay true, in Clem. 7. But to S. Hierome. How then does he conſtrue theſe words of Dauid, Againſt thee onely haue I ſinned, to haue been ſpoken Ad Euſtochium. in that ſenſe, becauſe Dauid was a King, and not to be proceeded againſt by any temporall puniſhment, or coactiue hand, of a mortall man?

He ſaies the courſe that God takes with Kings, if they offend, is not to deliuer them ouer to any man to chaſtize, but, Adduc ad me, as the father bid thē carrie the child to his mother, and our Sauiour the Apoſtles to bring the partie to him whome they could not cure. Let me alone with him, I ſhal deale with him. Orat. 1. in Babylam, he commends him more for moderating his hand, after he had once put the tyrant backe, and that he fell not to flat ſtriking (which is not lawfull for a Prieſt) then for debarring him entrance into the Church at firſt. For, the one, euery bodie would haue done, that is, execute his anger, beeing enraged, but onely Babylas, or one like him, keepe a meane in performing his office after prouocation. And becauſe we ſpake of chaines a little before, it may be for this cauſe, Babylas deſired to be buried with his chaines, as S. Chryſoſtome relates, in one of his Orations vpon him, and againe, Hom. 9. in 4. ad Epheſ. to ſhew what he endured, not what he adminiſtred; and ſo likewiſe of the ſword that was buried with him, after it had ſtruck off his head. S. Hilarie giues the reaſon, Can. 1. in Matth. why Rachel (that is, the Church) would not be comforted for her children, whome Herod had butchered, (that is, the perſecutor martyred) Conſolatio enim rei amiſſae praeſtanda eſt, non auctae: [For we comfort looſers, not gainers.] Now the Church gaines by patience in perſecution. Therefore ſhee looſes by reſiſtance, and oppoſition. Of which thing

Principatus corū in dilectione ſubditorum debet eſſe poſitus, non in timore corporali. Which laſt authoritie is cited by Bellarmine, lib. 4. c. 21. de Pontif.

[For as all carnall matters are ſubiect to force, not to free liking, and all ſpirituall matters to free liking, not to force; ſo are alſo ſpiritual ſuperiours. Their cheifdom or princehood ought to ſtand in the loue of ſuch as are vnder thē, not in their bodily feare, &c.] Which bodily feare, the Pope is wholly for driuing his ſubiects into, and without that he is nothing. But thus farre the Fathers, becauſe I ſpare the reſt.

Originally there is no ſuch power in a Biſhop. Will you then retort vpon the King with his owne licenſe, or vnnaturally gall him with his owne quils? Is not this the way rather to ſpoile all, and to diſarme the Church of the royall protection?
               § 14. You ſay [that he which hath command of the ſoule, hath alſo of the bodie. And therefore the ſpirituall power which is acknowledged to be in the Miniſter, drawes the temporall with it as a conſequent.] Truely I graunt, that he which can commaund the ſoule out of an abſolute power, it is likely the body is alſo ſubiect to him. But neither the miniſters power commaunds the ſoule, by any forcible impreſſion, (for as we cannot make one haire white or blacke, ſo no more can we make one ſoule merrie or ſad, further then as God ſhall cooperate with our endeauours) and the perſwaſions that we vſe, they are directed no leſſe to the ſauing of the bodie, then to the gaining of the ſoule. Both the Magiſtrate and the Miniſter, deale both with the ſoule and the bodie. But the Magiſtrate violently applies himſelfe to the bodie, to reclaime the ſoule, if neede be; and the Miniſter perſwaſiuely carries himſelfe to the ſoule, to the ende the bodie may be made pliant to righteouſneſſe, Rom. 6. The proceeding, not the ſubiect, then, is that which makes the difference betweene the two powers; and howſoeuer your Caſuiſts ſay, a lame-handed man cannot Sa.

And if More be of no more authority with you, you may looke backe to your owne Cardinall, that dry Child, that ſage Sobrino: yet he excuſes himſelfe in one place of his controuerſies (a worke a man would thinke that did not fit ſo with mirth) Ignoſcat

Yet becauſe you haue deſcried ſuch a veine in the Biſhop, as you thinke at leaſt, might you not haue anſwered your ſelfe, touching that which you obiect to him here about Iouinian, that it ſauoured but of Ironie? For what more fit to be hit in your teeth, who euery where crake to vs of Iouinians hereſies, then when you bring that in earneſt, to countenance your Poperie, which S. Hierome puts vpon Iouinian, by ſuppoſall? At dices, tu; Iouiniane ſcilicet. Though the Biſhop doth not challenge him for ſuch an abſolute Iouinianiſt, but onely ſaies, Probè in to ſecutus Iouinianum, the Cardinall therein following Iouinian very handſomely. Which words are enough to diſſolue your cauill, that the Biſhop ſhould lay abſolute Iouinianiſme to his charge, which, you ſay, ſurpaſſes all impudencie. Such a ruſtique you are, an arrant clowne, not diſcerning what is ieaſt, and what is earneſt. Howbeit, it will be hard for you, to prooue Iouinian to haue beene an hereticke, (Epiphanius and Philaſtrius doe not recken him among the catalogue). and they that may conclude him to haue held a falſhood, will finde ſome a doe to condemne him for an hereticks. Neither. is the meaning of that word by all agreed vpon, neither doe all take it in euery place alike: Yet becauſe this ſcandall reſts vpon Iouinian

man, and not the worſe for his marriage. As for the rewards of the faithfull, that they are not equall in the heauen that we looke for, and that the ſacred Virgin ſuffered no decay of her maidenly honour, by the ſtainleſſe and immaculate birth of our Sauiour, let Iouinian thinke what he will, (though S. Hierome neuer imputes this latter to Iouinian, in the 2. books that he wrote againſt him,) yet, not onely you, but troupes in the Engliſh Church ſo teach. And, would the time giue leaue, is there not a Montane, and a Tatian, to make you bluſh, for your abhominable hereſies, about meates and marriages, as well as you haue a Iouinian to twitt vs withall? But becauſe, I now onely aſſoyle the Biſhop from your wicked ſlaunders, it is well his integritie hath ſo acquitted him without me, that your ſelfe dare not ſpeake of him, but with, It may be, and, Except; ſuch a hooke his fame hath put in your noſtrills, who onely in this may be reſembled to Iouinian (to Paphnutius rather) that in ſingle life, he defends the libertie of other folkes marriages. But haſt we to an ende.
               § 17. To the other places of S. Hierome, as Matth. 16. which in great good will you aduiſe the Biſhop to read ouer forſooth, what ſaith S. Hierome there? That our Sauiours dicere is facere, his. ſaying is doing, therefore calling Peter a rocke, he made him ſo. But I hope, good Sir, as doing and ſaying went together in our Lord, ſo both of them in his owne meaning, not in your miſtaking. What is this then to prooue Peters Monarchie, or ſmaller regencie either, if ſuch could content you? And if it could, yet it were hard, I ſay, to boult it out of this place of S. Hierome, where (no ſyllable

               § 18. The like ad Marcellam, Epiſt. 54. vpon whome our Lord built his Church, namely Peter. But can we anſwer S.

                  Hierome better then by S. Hierome? The fortitude of the Church, or the puiſſance of the Church, was equally built, or grounded vpon them all. Super omnes ex aequo. You heard it before out of his 1. lib. againſt Iouinian. How does this then prooue Peters priuiledge, in the matter of authoritie, though building were graunted to found that way, as it doth not? And when S. Paul ſundrie times, as Coloſſ. 1. 23. and Eph. 2. 20. ſpeakes of grounding, and building the Church, either vpon faith, as in the firſt place, or vpon the Prophets and Apoſtles, as in the ſecond, ſhall we thinke he was enuious, that ſaid nothing of Peter, and that extraordinarie manner of the Churches building vpon him, that you dreame of?
               § 19. Here you tell vs of three waies, by which the Apoſtles might be ſaide to be foundations of the Church, in hope that Peter may be ſo in ſingular. And quoting Bellarmine for it, not your owne inuention, you counſell the Biſhop to learne it of him. Shall wee firſt ſee how good it is?  One way, for that they firſt conuerted nations, perſwaded  people, and founded Churches, not Peter alone, but ioyntly all of them. In this ſenſe belike they are all foundations. But what is this, to, beeing the foundation of the Catholicke Church, and to lie like a rocke vnder that great building, becauſe they were planters of particular Churches? Alſo you argue fallaciouſly, from the diligence of preaching, to the power of ſupporting, and that by authoritie, as now the queſtion is. Beſides, a founder and a foundation, is not all one. And did none plant Churches, good Sir, but the Apoſtles? Shall your Ieſuites in Iaponia be foundations too? And ſhall we ſay of them, ſuper quos aedificaeta eſt Eccleſia dei? You ſee the abſurditie. Yet you quote proofes, Rom. 15. I haue preached the Gospell where Chriſt was not named, leaſt I ſhould build vpon another mans foundation. Does this prooue that men are foundations of the Church? or rather, that the man and the foundation are two? Againe, 1. Cor. 3. I haue laid the foundation like a wiſe architect (ſo ſpeakes your Vitruviuſ-ſhip) but would you call him a wiſe Logician, that

ſhould argue from hence, that S. Paul meant himſelfe to be the foundation? Yea, though he ſaid not in the ſame place, Ieſus Chriſt, and no other foundation.
               
               § 20.  Secondly, you ſay the Apoſtles were all foundations, becauſe the Chriſtian doctrine was firſt imparted to them, and the preſent faith is groūded vpon that, which was deliuered at the firſt. And new articles of faith (you ſay) are not alway reuealed. Is not this accurate, trow you, as well for order as for ſubſtance? For had this been a reaſon, ought it not to haue been ſet, in all reaſon, before the other? Can a thing bee preached, afore it be vnderſtood? or made knowne to others, afore it ſelfe be knowne? Your argument therefore from preaching, ſhould by all meanes, I ſay, haue followed this from reuealing; and this from reuealing, haue gone before the other. But pardon your order, looke into your ſubſtance. Were not ſome things reuealed to others afore the Apoſtles? Did not our Lord firſt manifeſt his reſurrection to women? Did not the Angel ſay to them, Goe and tell Peter? Will you haue women and all to be the foundations of the Church? But we are much beholden to you, that you coyne not newe articles of faith euerie day. Articles therefore, and new articles you graunt, and of frequent reuelation, but not euery day. We long for your laſt kinde of foundation, wherein Peter is ſo entire.
               § 21. 
                  Thirdly then, you ſay, in reſpect of gouernement and authoritie. For Peters was ordinarie, theirs Legatine; his originall, theirs depending from him. You ſhould ſhewe what Father ſayes ſo, beſides your ſelues, for of Scripture you deſpaire. And yet you agree ſo ill emong your owne ſelues of this point, that you iumpe not about the very termes. For See Caſaub.

What ſo vnlike? Beſides, Aquine will tell him, that Paul rather anſwered to Moſes, then Peter; each of them beeing admitted to the Viſion of Gods eſſence; the one as principall of the Old Teſt, the other of the New, (for ſo he cōpares them) Ne

                  Baronius cals Peters power extraordinarie, the other Apoſtles ordinarie: you make his ordinary, and theirs extraordinary.
                  
Is it poſſible that kingdome ſhould long hold out, which is ſo at ods? Yet behold another leake in this obſeruation. For though the Apoſtles had deriued their authoritie from Peter; yet they might all haue beene foundations of the Church, as well as he, euen in regard of gouernment; no leſſe then ſome receiuing the doctrine immediatly from Chriſt, as Peter, Iames, and Iohn, (witnes Clemens in Euſebius before quoted) the others from them, yet you make them all, in regard of doctrine, to be foundations alike, num. 25.
               § 22. Another authoritie of S. Hieromes is out of his Epiſt. ad Damaſ. 57. I following no firſt, or chiefe but Chriſt, doe communicate with thy bleſſednes, [or am linked in fellowſhip with it,] that is to ſay, with the chayre of Peter, vpon that rocke I know the Church is built. You ſee Hierome followes no firſt but Chriſt. Nullum primum. Where is then the primacie that you challenge to Peter, if none of the Apoſtles be afore another, but Chriſt? Indeede Bellarmine ſaies, he meanes, he preferres none but Chriſt before Damaſus; which is an vtter peruerting of S. Hieromes words, who, as he ſaies, he followes no chiefe but Chriſt, or none prime but Chriſt, ſo he ſhewes after what ſort he is affected to Damaſus, communione not ſubiectione, by communion, not by ſubiection, (communico tibi) as to Theophilus, to Cyrill, to Athanaſius, to who not? the auncient orthodoxe profeſſe of themſelues in diuers places. But the edge of the place, as it ſerues your turne, lies in thoſe words, I know the Church is built vpon that rocke. Which rocke is Chriſt, not ſo long before mentioned but this may referre to it; and to build vpon a chayre, is no ſuch cleane pickt metaphore, that we ſhould be forced to take it ſo, though vpon a rocke be. Beſides the ſcio that he giues it, a word of certentie, makes vs * Vide citatos paulò ante auctores in hoc capit. p. 132. Quibus adde aliud S. Auguſt. tèſtimonium ex Tract. 10 in 1. Epiſt. Ioh c. 5.

But by no meanes doth it long to Peters perſon.
                   thinke he would neuer be ſo peremptorie for Peter, ſith diuers haue conſtrued the rocke another way, whome S. Hierome would not croſſe ouer haſtily with his Solo; and laſtly his owne modeſtie declared

a little before, profeſſing to follow none but Chriſt. Therefore he tooke Peter for no ſuch foundation.

                   as if that might diſparage him in compariſon of Peter, it was not becauſe his power was narrower then Peters, (for

our Sauiour confined not Iames to Hieruſalem, but priuate election) but to ſhew that S. Iames abode there, as thinking his paines beſt employed in that place, Peter in the meane while trauelling farther into the world. In the 3. of ler. 17. v. one would thinke Hieruſalem the higher ſeat thē Rome, beſides that it was our Sauiours prouince, as I told you, and ſo perhaps to be preferred in that reſpect. So farre is Peter from any excellence aboue Iames.
               
               § 26. I might paſſe by your argument out of the 44. Pſalme, In ſtead of fathers thou ſhalt haue children, whome thou maiſt make Princes in all lands. Suppoſe firſt, that this were Monarchicall princehood, or a princehood of power, of maieſtie, and of authoritie, which is nothing leſſe: for Ite praedicate carries no ſuch commiſſion. Yet then they were ſent into all the world, then they were made Princes in all lands. But whatſoeuer it be, what is this to Peter? Is it not common to all, does it not extend to all? And not onely Peter is not deſigned to be he, but no one Prince magnified before another, though we ſhould graunt the ſingularitie to be his, if anies. And ſhall all the Apoſtles now haue their ſucceſſors? ſhall all their authorities be conueied to after-commers? I had thought Peters onely had beene permanent. Yet here, of all, Pro patribus tuis naſcentur filij; euery Apoſtle hath his ſonne, his ſucceſſor, and euery ones ſonne is made a Prince throughout all the world. You will ſay perhaps it makes for temporall power in the Epiſcopall calling, though not for Peters ſucceſſors in ſpeciall. But to omit, that Princehood here is regnare verbo, and regnare praconio, in which ſenſe Virgil ſaies, a diligent husbandman—imperat aruis, as a King at his worke, and in his calling, though homely; You may remember that Chryſoſtome and Theodoret

Theſe are

the crakes of this inſolent patch; the very impatience whereof, were able to diuert any man from his buſines. But how does he take away the Biſhops anſwer, who yeilds him euen more then S. Baſil ſaies in fauour of Peter, and yet ſtill

                  forſooth no Monarch, to returne his owne words, ſcoffing though he vſe them, not aſhamed now in plaine tearmes to plead for the Monarchie of ſpirituall men. I know Biſhopricks haue beene called ſo, as by Hilarie, Pope, in his Epiſtle ad Leontium, but neuer in this ſenſe. And ſo Paſchaſinus (emong Leo's Epiſtles it is) finds a Corona in his great Patron, to wiſh honour and good ſucceſſe to. But theſe are baubles. To the point in hand then. If the argument ſtand in BLESSED, that Peter was a Monarch, becauſe called bleſſed, either by our Sauiour, or S. Baſil, to omit how many others haue beene called bleſſed, both men and women, in holy Scripture, (they recken ſome ſeauen in all, I trow, of the feminine kinde) to whome no Monarchie was decreed; Et nos cum Petro beati, ſaies Epiphanius, and we are bleſſed with

                  Peter, if we hold faſt his confeſſion. Nay, they ſay when Bellarmines vncle came to the Popedome, the times were ſo bad, that it was thought a man could not be Pope and ſaued, Maſſon. in Marcello 2. that is, Pope and bleſſed. Therefore what doth this argument from beatus on Gods name? But to omit this I ſay, the Biſhop ſcanning S. Baſils words, finds Baſil the beſt opener of his owne meaning, both concerning the bleſſednes of Peter, and his beeing preferred before the reſt, which is the firmer hold of the two, for you to truſt to, if you be wiſe. For immediatly thus it followes in S. Baſil, after 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , preferred before all, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, who onely was witneſſed of more then others, and was pronounced bleſſed before others. Does not 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   now, limit 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as the Biſhop had ſaid? Does not the honour that he receiued, to be witneſſed of by Chriſt, as a little before he had witneſſed of Chriſt, and our Sauiours pronouncing him bleſſed in plaine termes, (which imports no iuriſdiction, whatſoeuer you fancie) limit

his preferment in S. Baſils ſtyle? And though no ſuch thing were in S. Baſil, yet how many waies are there of preferment, beſides making Monarch, or inſtalling one ſupreame Prince of the world? Your ſelfe, Sir, can tell vs ſoone after very ſawcily, num. 10. of this Chapt. that the King can ſhewe fauour to ſome one ſubiect, and yet not make him Primate of the prouince. So might Peter be preferred, and yet not made a Soueraigne prince, much more. Though the more I conſider it, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is leſſe then our PREFERRED in Engliſh. For he meanes, hee preferred him in voice & verdict, not in real exaltation, as they commonly take it. And that is it which the Biſhop anſwered out of S. Baſils owne words: preferred, but how, quoth he? 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. Let vs looke into the third title of Peters ſtyle, as it runnes in S. Baſil, Cui claues, &c. to whome the keyes of the heauenly Kingdome were committed. But do you ſee how? Not onely the kingdome is deſcribed here, to be heauenly, not earthly, which Peter receiued the keyes of, (what is this then, I wonder, to temporall Monarchies, which the very place ſo counterbuffes, and yet they would faine eſtabliſh, and eſtabliſh from hence?) but how does it make for Peters ſoueraigntie, ſince as the Biſhop hath moſt pregnantly anſwered before, he receiued the keies indeed as Baſil ſayes, but whether for himſelfe, or for the Church, Baſil ſhewes not, Auſten does. You ſay, you haue refuted this, and Cap. 1. I thinke we haue anſwered you. Cum caeteris communicandas claues accepit, ſayes Optatus himſelfe. Will you haue ſo many Monarchs, as receiued the keyes, that are afraid of two a little after?
               § 2. Your impudent putting of a Monarchie vpon the Pope, by your queint definition, as you think at leaſt, holds no water, and much leſſe fire. A Monarch is he (ſay you) that gouernes for the common good, not for his owne. Let vs beleeue the Pope to be that ſingle-hearted Charitie, quaerens non quae ſua ſunt ſed aliorum (aliorum indeede too often, for the deuill himſelfe giues ouer ſeeking his owne, if S. Bernard
                  
ſay true) is this all that is required to make a Monarch? Is there no difference betweene gouernment and gouernement? Let Gelaſius tell you, de vinculo Anathematis, to ſay nothing of Chryſoſt. a little before quoted, or hath not our Sauiour himſelfe, a Vos autem non ſic, to ſpoile your definition, and to marre his Monarchie?
               
               § 3. I might tell you of S. Baſil in this very worke, what reſpect God hath planted in vs to Kings, by the hand of nature, which reſpect you would ſo wickedly purloyne from them, and carrie cleane away to the Popes, by peruerting the Fathers words about S. Peter. I haue

                  , &c. Seeſt thou of the Diſciples of Chriſt, all high and worthy to be choſen, one is called a rocke, and hath the foundations of the Church entruſted to him, another is more loued, and leanes vpon the breaſt of Ieſus, and the reſt brooke this praelation,

                  . So that, whereas afore he argued out of S. Baſil from praelatus eſt, we haue now prelation firſt of more then one. But proceed. When they muſt goe vp to the mountaine, that he might gliſter in his ſhape, and ſhew his godhead, and diſcouer him that lay hid in the fleſh, who go vp with him? For all are not beholders of the miracle. Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which both were, and were reputed to be afore the others. Afore we had two 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , preferred; nowe we haue three, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that were, and were reckoned to be afore the reſt. But who were with him in his agonie, and a little before his death, when he went aſide and prayed? the ſame againe. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . This is the order that our Sauiour tooke in preferring. It followes. The reſt of their comlineſſe, and orderlineſſe, how great? Peter asks this queſtion, Philip that, Iudas that, Thomas that, another that, and neither all the ſame, nor one man all, but euery man particularly, and one by one; and as you would ſay, euery one thereafter as he needed. But of that what thinke you? Philip would ſay a thing, and dares not alone, but takes Andrew to him. Peter hath a queſtion to aske, and ſets on Iohn by a nodde. Where is ſurlineſſe here? where is ambition? How could they more ſhew themſelues the diſciples of Chriſt, that meeke and humble hearted one for vs, a ſeruant for vs his ſeruants, and who in all things returned all the glorie to his Father, that he might ſhew vs an example of orderlineſſe and modeſtie, which we are ſo farre from obſeruing, that I would think it were well with vs, if we were not bold-hardier then all beſides, &c. Now let F. T. plead for primacie from hence, and the pride that our Sauiour ſuppreſſed in his diſciples ſo long agoe. You ſee, that if our Sauiour preferred one, he preferred more, and the name of preferment, ſerues them all alike, no better

of Peter, no worſe of Iames, of Iohn, &c. So true it is, that the Biſhop anſwered, of many monarchs, to bee pickt from hence, if any at all. But what ſay we to the words, as ſore as a bile, That Peter had ſibi credita Eccleſiae fundamenta, the foundations of the Church entruſted to him? Neither does this prooue monarchy, nor ſupreame magiſtracie. It is nothing but an exegeſis of what went before, that Peter was a rock & not a rocke for nothing, but to build vpon, and to carry (as the reſt doc, Apoc. 21. for I muſt not leaue vrging him with the Biſhops anſwer, though I ſee it anger him) the foundations of the Church, though to him, more particularly confeſſing Chriſt, it was ſaid alſo more particularly. But if this was the reward of his conſtant profeſſion, as no man doubts, and the text moſt clearely ſhewes, to bee tearmed rocke, and withall hee confeſt in the name of the reſt, as Bellarmine

For, as we graunt, the preheminence that Nazian. ſpeakes, to haue beene yeelded S.

For as he ſpake firſt, ſo the tearmes of honour firſt lighted vpon him, no authoritie, Sir.

For his honour was reall, Peters verball (hitherto) though I knowe that Chriſt makes all good in the ende which he promiſes. Peters doubtfull, and ſubiect to expoſitions; Iohns cleare, euident, and ocular. Peter, you ſay, was the firſt ſtone in the foundation after Chriſt, but Iohn wee ſee, immediately leaned vpon his breaſt; which breaſt, if it be, (as certenly it is) the foundation of the Church, is not this a type, who hath the greater intereſt therein of the twaine? But your way ſhould haue beene, if you had not been that fumbler, to haue argued thus out of our graunts; That all the Apoſtles were the foundations of the Church, and Peter had the foundations committed to his charge, as Nazianzene ſaies, therefore Peter was made gouernour of the Apoſtles. As if 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , were any thing but the exegeſis of a rocke, as I ſaid, ordained for building, it ſelfe the foundation, and carrying the foundations as you would ſay;

But this complaint comes all too late nowe. And no force. Yet the Latine tranſlatour found them there, as it is moſt probable (you ſay) in the auncient Greeke copies. Why not you rather foiſted them into his tranſlation? or, what if he were falſe and partial to your ſide, as you ſaid euen now, the Grecians were to theirs, and ſo put them in where he found them not?

On the other ſide, how direct is the Biſhop in his proceedings? how ſquare, as I may ſay, and exact euerie way? Hath hee not ſatisfied the Cardinall to the very laſt farthing, and paied the ſcore which he brought to conuince the King withall? His MAIESTIE calls for the Fathers of ſuch a compaſſe, to diſprooue him. And you ſee howe they are brought, not onely ſpeaking by an interpretor, and not the faithfulleſt neither, whereas there ſhould be no compromitting at all in ſo ſerious a canvaſe: but no tinker in his kettleworke was euer more fowly foyled, then he in avouching the Cardinals quotations.

In ſo much, as if I ſhould not anſwer a word more in the behalfe of the Biſhop, yet you ſee how he hath performed as much as he vndertooke, namely, to maintain the kings challēge againſt the Cardinal, about the iudgement of the Fathers within ſuch a ſpace, and this fellow cannot refute him without ſuch ſhamefull ſhifts, as lay him open to more diſgrace. Yet to two places I will ſay ſomewhat, for the other are not worth the while.
               § 6.  Out of the Homily aforeſaid, Peter was a diamond, Ieremy a braſen pillar, or an iron wall. And which meant Chryſoſt.  for the ſtronger of the two? or did he meane to magnify one aboue the other at all? yet you ſhould ſpeake to their authoritie, and let their conſtancie alone. Their vertue is one thing, their place another, howſoeuer how confound them. Vnleſſe you thinke, that becauſe with you place goes for vertue, (witneſſe Hildebrande in Dictatis) therefore with them vertue may inferre place too, which is nothing ſo. But let vs heare the reſt. Ieremy was ſet ouer one nation, Peter ouer the whole world. And what is this, but the difference of the old teſtament and the new? the field and the garden? fons ſignatus Cant. 4. and fons patens or recluſus Zach. 13. the breaking downe of the partition-wall, Eph. 2. the rending of the vaile, &c. I hope euery miniſter in the new teſtament, not Peter onely, hath not the land of Palaeſtine, which might be Ieremies limitation, but the latitude of the whole world, to deale with. Yea it is your owne doctrine, c. 2. numb. 50. and 52. that as farre as the Church reaches, (which at this day reaches through out the whole world,) the office and function of euery miniſter may extend. But the Apoſtles ſpecially, betweene whome and Peter, herein, there was no ods, whatſoeuer difference there might be in their prouinces, as they parted them among themſelues.  Yea,  but Peter might haue choſen Matthias Apoſtle without communicating with the reſt, for which you quote Chryſoſtome hom.

No doubt he regards the flocke of Chriſt, in ſpeaking firſt in the congregation, about the choice of an Apoſtle, which much concerned the Church at that time, not to be deſtitute of a paſtor, in the defect of Iudas.

We are therefore to vnderſtand, that if Chryſoſt. ſay (as he ſaies but at vncertaine) that Peter might haue made the Apoſtle himſelfe, he might vpon preſumption of the multitudes good will, who would not haue conteſted with him in ſuch a caſe likely, as honouring him for his vertue, &c. In which regard he commends to vs the meeknes of thoſe times, for our imitation, and as he ſaies, that Peter did nothing

But omitting complaints, quae ne tum quidem gratae, tùm neceſſariae, what ſay you to the anſwers to S. Auſtens place? Three exceptions did the Biſhop take vnto it. Firſt, 1 2 
                  that it was cited out of a doubtfull worke. Secondly, that it mentioned but a crazed head, and therefore not to be brought for honeſty ſake, to prooue Peters primacie, which another would diſprooue it by rather. 
                   Thirdly, that S. Auſten, not in aſermon de Tempore, but in a lawfull Synod, cures this head, by confining him to his bounds, and reſtraining appeales from beyond the ſea, which you brooke not. The firſt of theſe is confirmed diuers wayes. I 1 One, that the title of thoſe Sermons is not ſincere, neither giuen by S. Auſten at the firſt, nor yet knowne by that name diuerſe hundreds of yeares, after his death. And if S. Auſten wrote no Sermones de tempore, why ſhould we yeeld, as to S. Auſtens authoritie, to that which is quoted by the name of de Tempore? Yet you ſay, they are taken out of other his works. Let thoſe workes then bee quoted by their owne names: let euery witneſſe appeare in his owne likeneſſe.

Does not ſuch an one rather profeſſe that he meanes craft? Innominatus habetur pro nullo, is the axiome of the law. And why not then peruersè nominatus, much more?  Beſides, you haue ſo chopt the  number of theſe Sermons, yea the ſubſtance too, now adding, then diminiſhing, ſometime amplifying, and then againe withdrawing, in your diuers editions, that no Euripus more vncertaine to build faith vpon. And yet theſe you bring

forſooth to confute his MAIESTIE, and to diſprooue his challenge. For where you ſay, they were ſo called and culled out from the reſt, for the eaſe and commoditie of the Readers: I ſee not what more eaſe can be in giuing them a falſe name then a true, or what commoditie can ariſe from hence to the Reader, vnleſſe to be abuſed and deceiued, be a commoditie. Yet ſuch are the commodities, Egraunt, that you Ieſuites deale in, when you ſet forth Authors.  But laſtly, the  Sermon it ſelfe, bewrayes it ſelfe, to be none of S. Auſtens. As what thinke you of that clauſe in the latter ende of it? Agnouit enim ſibi vt homini peccati irrepſiſſe perniciem, quod totum hactenus vt memini diuinitùs procuratum eſt. Haue you ſo loſt your ſmell, as not to difcerne betweene this, and the true S. Auſten? I ſay nothing of that which followes, which no wiſe man but would abiure for S. Auſtens, Videte quemadmodum exiguae culpae permittitur ſubiacere tantus Apoſtolus: (firſt, who euer called this exigua cupla, to denie our Sauiour? which Bellarmine himſelfe, when he excuſes De Rom.

Yet, Quemadmodum eum dominus tui cauſâ patitur circumſcribi delicto, would not bee paſſed ouer. I leaue it to your thinking. In the ſame ſermon, hee makes Peter to haue been a ſtarke Pelagian; Per ſolum liberum arbitrium, non addito dei adiutorio, promiſerat ſe pro. Domino moriturum.

Auſten wrote Sermons of the ſolemne tunes of the yeare, of Saints dayes alſo, &c. ſo hath the Biſhop preached as much as any, of the yearely feſtiualls, (and long may he I pray God) yet he neuer thought he had made ſermons de Tempore, till you told him ſo. The thing no doubt is auncient, for the ſubſtantiall obiect, to ſolemnize the appointed times of the yeare, as the Quadrageſima, or the Aſcenſion, or the Natalitia, and

the like, which you inſtance in, with ſutable ſermons: but Sermones de Tempore, is too ſhort a name, though we take in de Sanctis too, to comprehēd all, ſith there were many more Sermons made, both by Auſten, and others, vpon ordinarie Sundayes, which are reducible to neither part of the afore-ſaid diuiſion.  As for that you alledge out of Poſſidius, that  S. Austen made ſermons in vigilijs paſchae, vpon Easter eue, whereof this, you ſay, was one in all likelihood, beeing made on the Wedneſday before Easter, is it not as mad as all the reſt, or ſhall we thinke it likely, that Eaſter eue fell vpon the wedneſday before Eaſter? What confidence hath the Ieſuite, that would bore ſuch holes in his Readers noſe, and paint his face, while he lies broad awake? Yet numb. 56. of this Chapter, you find that which vvas 14. yeare after the time, as fit as the Eue, you ſay, to the holy day, belike that we may beleeue you the rather here, of three daies diſtance between the Eue and the Feaſt, vvhen at another time the Eue ſell out iuſt 14. yeere, you ſay, afore the holy day. And ſo much to inſtifie the Biſhops firſt exception.
               §. 8. To the ſecond you anſwer, that Bellarmine had no II reaſon to be greatly aſhamed of the place that mentions Peters frailty, for euen that confirmes his primacy moſt wonderfully. How ſo? For hauing had tryall of infirmities, he was ſo much the apter to ſuccour others, or to ſhew compaſſion to others. Truely I doubt not, but Peters fall made him the tendererhearted to repenting ſinners, yet not ſo much in his particular, or for any primacie, as repreſenting the Church, and the whole bodie of the miniſtery, as you were told out of S. Auſten, de Agone Chriſtiano. c. 30. Elſe onely Popes ſhould bee tender hearted. Though S. Auſten alſo in the place, that you newly quoted, Serm. de Temp. 124. ſaies it fell the rather vpon Peter, becauſe he was a fierce and a cholericke man, (not onely feruent as others call him) as his practiſe ſhewed vpon poore Malchus, and therefore it was meete he ſhould be abated ſo. Howſoeuer it be, the Biſhops exception to the Cardinal is very good, that a better place

would haue beene brought in all reaſon out of S. Auſten, ſo copious an author, to prooue Peters headſhip by, then that which implyes the crazines of it, euen before we are ſhewed to what vſe the ſoundnes of it ſerues. Neither does the Biſhop argue, as you wickedly ſlaunder him, that Peter by frailty denyed our Sauiour, ergò he is not head of the Church. And yet it were as good as Bellarmines argument, and better too, which you vſe in this place, that his headſhip is confirmed, or eſtabliſhed by his fall. As if none could fall any whit fowly, but from the height of ſupremacy ouer the Church. Was it nothing to fall after his exaltation to the Apoſtleſhip, after other graces which he enioyed not a few? Did not this make our Eutychus his fal the more dangerous, that he tumbled downe euen from ſuch a window? That you may ſee how many primacies were in Peter, as it were ſtories in a building, though no ſuch monarchicall preheminence enſue: which primacies the Biſhop neuer denied. And if Peters gentlenes, which he learned by his fall, reach no further, then to aſſoile offenders vpon their repentance, as I ſee not what other you here ayme at, you know that office belongs to all Prieſts in generall, as well as to the head of Prieſts, and therefore no Popedome followes fromhence any way at all.
               § 9. To your place of S. Gregory, hom. 22. in Euang. that our Lord intended Petrum praeferre cunctae Eccleſiae, we returne S. Greg. l. 4. in 1. Reg. cap. vltimum, that Paul was made caput nationum, where caput is more then praeferri eccleſiae, ſith euery miniſter is ſet ouer the Church, as we haue often told you, Qui vocatur ad Epiſcopatum, vocatur ad ſeruitutem

Goffrid. Tract. de Ordin. &c. for the ſenſe is all one, and euery where you ſee the latitude of their bounds; and in a word, they are nothing but circūlocutions of their Apoſtleſhips both Pauls and Peters. Laſtly, you abuſe the Biſhop intolerably,

in ſaying he taunts at Peters fal, who is of another ſpirit, and knowes that Saints can, pugnare de genu, or as S. Chryſoſtome 
                  Seneca. ſaies,

Rhetor. Cic. de orat. 2. teach you, Eth. 4. and elſewhere. So much alſo of his ſecond exception.
               § 10.  It is long before he will vnderſtand the third, as  hauing no mind to it, loath to come at it. It ſtands in this. That S. Auſten, not a counterfeit Sermon of Auſtens, but himſelfe in perſon, and ſitting in Councell, neither flouriſhing before the people in a baſtard homily, about Peters prerogatiues (which we muſt tell you again & again, are not ſtraight the Popes, though you preſume ſo,) but conſulting moſt aduiſedly in an aſſembly of Fathers about the Biſhop of Rome, (which is the man in controuerſie, and againſt whome our plea lies, not againſt Peter,) I ſay, that S. Auſten conſulting about the Pope, and his authority to heare appeales, in a councell of Africa, is not fearefull to cenſure them with excommunication, as many as ſhall appeale beyond the ſea, that is to Rome, ſaies Balſamon, that is to the Pope ſay we, and you will not denie. Which how could S. Auſten and others haue done, I would faine know of you, if they had beene perſwaded of his vniuerſall power ouer the Chriſtian world!
               § 11. Here you caſt myſts, and fogs, and raylings. But paſſing by them, as the Moone does by the barking of a curre-dogge, let vs take you as you lie. You deduct three points from the Biſhops words, as you ſay, and you call them three lies of his, in little more then three lines. Vſuall modeſtie, but let vs view your parts. The firſt, That the Pope had no further authoritie, but ouer the Church of Rome in S. Austens time. The ſecond, That no man might appeale to Rome, out of Africk, in thoſe daies. The third, That S. Auſten neuer acknowledged thoſe three Popes, Zozimus, Bonifacius, and Celeſtinus, to

be heads of the Church, and yet cured S. Peters diſeaſe in them. The firſt, ſay you, will be cleare by the diſcuſſing of the ſecond and the third. But how if the Biſhop neuer affirmed the firſt? neither is any ſuch thing to be gathered out of his wordes? What needes your ſecond and third to refute this? Why rather doe you not bend againſt the ſecond, and third, for their owne ſakes, to ſhew that all Appeales were not cut off, by the Fathers, out of Africk to Rome, or that S. Auſten cured the ſwelling diſeaſe in the Popes aforeſaid? Does not this ſhew, that you neither want impudence, and yet want matter? ſince the Biſhops words, that may ſound that way to your firſt propoſitiō, are only theſe, If euer he be healed (viz. the Pope) let him be head of the Church of Rome, as he was in S. Auſtens time, but let no man appeale, &c. And is this as much as that the Pope had no authoritie ouer more then Rome? whereas the Biſhop neither denies his Weſterne Patriarkſhip,

So as power & authority go not alway together, though the Ieſuit confound them. nor otherwiſe the great ſway that he might iuſtly carrie throughout the reſt of Chriſtendome, out of the eminencie of his place, eſpecially if ioyned with vertues anſwerable, though ſtill his Dioceſſe were but particular. But as for Appeales, what more plaine, for the proouing that S. Auſten cenſured all ſuch Appellants out of Africk to the ſea of Rome, with excommunication, then that which we read in the Councel of Milevitum, Can. 22. enacted both by him, and diuers other Biſhops there? Whoſoeuer ſhall think fit to appeale beyond the Sea, let no perſon within Africk receiue him to fellowſhip, or to communion. Firſt therefore you turne away, and will not vnderſtand, till diuers ſections after, any ſuch Canon or Councell, but tell vs of a letter written to Pope Celeſtine by the African Biſhops, which, you ſay, was petitorie, but containing no Decree nor demand, as altogether reſting in Celeſtines pleaſure, whether he would graunt it, or no. I will ſet downe the words, that the truth may be ſeene. Though this I muſt premiſe, that it was nothing vnbeſeeming the holy Fathers, to vſe reuerēt termes, euen of petition and requeſt to Pope Celeſtine, when they

ſued for no more then their owne right, as the Apoſtle S. Peter, and diuers others in the like caſes, I beſeech you brethren, abſtaine &c. Sapientem omnia priùs quàm armis experiri decet; it is the old ſaying: and, Responſio mollis frang it iram. So here. Strictè exigo, & ſtrictè praecipio, is for the Pope to his Catholiques, whome he makes conies. But the words are theſe: Our due ſalutations remembred, and done: We entreat, and earneſtly pray you, that hereafter you will not lightly giue audience to thoſe that come from hence to you, neither any more receiue ſuch to the communion, as we excommunicate: becauſe your Reuerence ſhall eaſily perceiue that order taken by the Nicene Councell. For if there appeare a prouiſo for inferiour Clerkes and lay-men, how much more would the Synode haue the ſame obſerued in Biſhops, that beeing excommunicated in their owne Province, they ſhould not be ſuddenly, haſtily, or vnduly reſtored to the communion by your holineſſe? And likewiſe your holines muſt repell theſe wicked refuges of Prieſts, and other Clergie men [to Rome,] as becommeth you: for that by no determination of the Fathers, this is derogated from the Church of Africa: and the Nicene Canons doe moſt euidently commit both inferiour Clergie-men, and the Biſhops themſelues, to their owne Metropolitans. No doubt they moſt wiſely and rightly prouide, that all matters ſhould be ended in the places where they firſt aroſe: neither ſhall the grace of the holy Ghoſt be wanting to any Prouince, by the which equitie may be grauely weighed, and ſtoutly followed, by the Prieſts of Chriſt, especially whereas euery man hath libertie, if he miſlike the iudgement of thoſe that heare his cauſe, to appeale to the Councells of his owne Prouince, or to a generall Councell. Or how ſhall the iudgement ouer the Seas [at Rome] be good, whereto the neceſſarie perſons of the witneſſes, either for ſexe, or for age, or ſundrie other impediments, cannot be brought? FOR THAT ANY SHOVLD BE SENT [as Legates] FROM YOVR HOLINES SIDE, VVEE FINDE DECREED BY NO SYNOD OF THE FATHERS.
               § 12. And be here no words, but ſupplicatorie, wil you ſay? When they vrge ſo vehemently, that the Nicene

Councel tooke order to the ſame purpoſe, that cauſes ſhould not be remooued from place to place, alluding to the 5. Canon of that Councell, and to the latter end of the fourth, doe theſe men thinke it is a matter of meere graunt, or wholly depending of the Popes pleaſure? when they cal ſuch a refuge, a wicked refuge, of them that runne to Rome, doe they not ſhew what opinion they conceiue of it? Is it in the Popes power to licenſe wickedneſſe, or if it bee nowe, was it ſo then? Nay, when they ſay hee muſt repulſe ſuch ſtragling clients, is muſt a word for ſuters and ſuppliants? when they tell him in the ſame paſſage, that it becomes him to ſtop ſuch holes, that wretched men would creepe out at, doe they not plainely declare, that they haue more confidence in it, then in a meere ſute or petition onely? yea, when they vrge againe, that the Nicene Councell ſo ordered, and no derogation was euer made to that Canon, by any contrary conſtitution, doe they leaue it free to the Pope to yeeld to, yea or no? No doubt, ſay they, they moſt wiſely and rightly prouided, that all matters ſhould bee ended in the places where they firſt aroſe. And would theſe men haue confeſt, that the Pope might with iuſtice doe to the contrarie? When they tell him, That the grace of the holy Ghoſt is not ſo faſtened to 
                  The holy Ghoſt 
                        〈◊〉

                  Rome, but that it is to be foūd in other Prouinces too, by the which equitie may be grauely waighed, and ſtoutly followed by the Prieſts of Chriſt; doe they not priuily taxe him for fondly ouerweening his owne ſea, if he thinke matters cannot bee ended at home, without his interpoſing? When they alledge, that witneſſes cannot bee preſent at Rome, whom either age, or ſexe, or diuerſe other infirmities and caſualties hinder, and yet ſo neceſſarie many times, as that the cauſes cannot bee tryed without them, doe they not rather ſhew, what is meet in reaſon, and iuſt in conſcience, then leaue it wholly in the Popes hands, to graunt or no? Laſtly, what opinion had they of the Popes agents in forraine countries, that ſticke not to auouch this to his head, That any from his Holineſſe ſhould be ſent as Legates, we finde decreed by no Synode of the Fathers?
                  
Where, becauſe you dare talke of the Nicene copies, as allowing appeales, which were pretended then Numb. 36. with ſhame enough, but none ſuch found vpon moſt diligēt enquiry, take you in that alſo which followeth, in Gods name. That which you ſent vs hither by Fauſtinus, as a part of the Nicene Councell, in the truer copies which wee haue receiued from holy Cyrill Biſhop of Alexandria, and reuerend Atticus Biſhop of Conſtantinople, taken out of the originals themſelues (which alſo we ſent to Bonifacius your predeceſſor) in them, we ſay, wee could finde no ſuch thing. Let Baronius, or Bellarmine, ſalue this now, as well as they can. Finally thus. And as for your agents or meſſengers, ſend them not, graunt them not at, euerie mans requeſt (doe you ſee how faintly theſe men ſpeake, as remembring they ſued onely to the Pope for that which was in his power to graunt or no; and which if he did grant, he did but depart with his owne right?) To which, this that followes, may be a notable confirmation? Leaſt wee ſeeme to bring the ſmokie pride of the world, into the Church of Chriſt, which propoſeth the light of ſimplicitie and humilitie to thoſe that deſire to ſee God, &c. This of the Epiſtle of the African Fathers to Pope Caeleſtine.
               
               § 13. But now what ſaies he to the Mileuitan Canon? Sith that was it, which the Biſhop aymed at; as at laſt he awakes, and acknowledges himſelfe. It excludes not all from appealing (quoth he) but Prieſts and Deacons onely, and ſuch inferiour Clergie men. So as ſtill the Biſhops might appeale to Rome. And, tranſmarinus nemo, is of the Biſhops forging, too too generall. Is it euen ſo? Whoſe forging then is that, Ad tranſmarina autem qui putauer it appellandum, whoſoeuer ſhall thinke good to appeale beyond the ſea, let him be renounced from the communion of all in Africa, the very words of the Canon?

For if (ſay they) there appeare a prouiſo for inferiour Clerks and laymen, how much more would the Synode haue the ſame to be obſerued in Biſhops, that beeing excommunicated in their owne prouince, they ſhould not be ſuddenly, haſtily, or vnduly, reſtored to the Communion, no not by your holines? And as the Councell of Nice, meaning to forbid both Clerks and Lay, to forſake the iudgement of their owne prouince, and betake themſelues to another, named not the Biſhops, and yet in the generall comprehended them too, quoting an auncienter Canon for their purpoſe,

T. will haue none but thoſe to be prohibited, who are directly named. If he ſay they might, what a wide gate is left open to tumult and diſorder, notwithſtanding the Canon, for lay-men to doe that which Clerks might not? Nay how does the Clerke auoid committing himſelfe to forreine tribunals, ſith a lay-man, in caſe of controuerſie with a Clerke, complaining to a forreiner, drawes

the Clerke happily after him, to his no ſmall moleſtation? If he ſay, he might not; but that he is forbidden, though he be not ſpecified, ſo might the Biſhops likewiſe, which is our queſtion. Laſtly, if thoſe Fathers might forbid Clergi-men to appeale to Rome, though Clergi-men onely of the inferiour ſort, it ſhewes that the Popes iuriſdiction is not vniuerſall, and in the ende Biſhops might be forbid and all.
               § 14. As for your fuſtïe Epiſtle to Antonie of Fuſſula, it is out of the number of S. Auſtens Epiſtles, which Poſſidius recounts, a faithfull witneſſe of S. Auſtens desks and papers. One Grauius, a Dutchman, brought it firſt from Rome, and ſet it out as a neweltie, which your ſelues durſt not auow, from whome it ſprang. And though nothing is in the Epiſtle preiudiciall to our cauſe, which may not eaſily be anſwered, yet this ſhall ſuffice in this place.
               § 15. Innocentius, you ſay, allowed the Canon of the Milevitan Councell. Therefore it makes not againſt the Pope. Nay, therefore Innocentius was content with that proportion, which the later Popes are not ſatisfied with. As Boniface himſelfe in his Epiſtle to Eulalius Biſhop of Carthage, is ſo impatient of this reſtraint, that he makes the deuill to be the author of that, which S. Auſten and the reſt deuiſed, for the barring of Appeales to Rome. Behold, what kin the deuill is to S. Auſten, as Boniface would perſwade. And yet others ſucceeding, leſſe moderate then he. You tell vs that the Sardican Councell allowed theſe appeales. What then? Therefore this in all likelihoode contradicts them not. As if that which was lawfully ordained at firſt, might not afterward be changed vpon apparant inconuenience, as your ſelfe here inſinuate of the Popes Legates, and their outrages: of whome you know what 
                     Saliſb. Polycrat. Vide & Bernard. de conſid. ad Eugen. l. 4. The words of Charles Brandon Earle of Suffolke, that England neuer receiued any good by the Popes Legates. Vide & Sadolet. Epiſt. one ſaid, that they were as Satanas emiſſus à facie Domini ad vexandum orbem terrarum, like the deuill let looſe to ſcourge the world. Yet, you like a good fellow, would prooue the lawfulneſſe of appeales, by their pranks and practiſes, though neuer ſo irregular,

as he that would iuſtifie falſe titles by poſſeſſion. Albeit neither was the Sardican Councell generall, and ſo of no force to bind all in all places: and if it had ſo beene, yet you may remember, how many Sanctions euen of the Nicene Councell, are out of vſe with you, cancel'd, abrogate, as the Biſhop ſhewes in one part of that booke of his, Cap. 7. p. 168. which you now fumble about the refuting of. To omit that the conſtitution runnes but thus, though it were neuer ſo authenticall, euen by Placet vobis? May you pleaſe Can. 3. Sard. Concil. to allow; and rather for Iulius his vertue, then the ſeats priuiledge, and ſo to laſt no longer then men endued with the like integritie that Iulius was, ſhould occupie the roome, but no way deſcending of ſuch originall right, as you pretend.

               § 16. Now to backe your fancie, that appeales were not forbid by the Mileuitan Canon, in S. Auſtens time, you deſcend to Leos time, ſhort of S. Auſtens, ſo as you refute not the Biſhop, nor ſay nothing to the purpoſe, but that you long to be vntruſſing your pedlerly fardles. As if Leo were not like enough to encroach vpon the Canon, to gaine aduantage to his Sea; a ſea indeed, which eares out the earth 
                     Leo Epiſt. 87. ad Epiſcop. Maucitaniae. though neuer ſo well fenced: and the diſtreſſed eſtate of the Churches of Africa, encreaſing with the times, might driue them to admit of more then was reaſon, but that they were glad to make their peace, at any hand, though with hard conditions. Concerning Gregories times, you fall a 
                     Greg. Regiſt. l. 1. epiſt. 82.
                  
great deale lower, though you are clean beſides the cuſhion there too. For whereas you granted before, that the Canon forbad the appeales of Deacons, though not of Biſhops; now you bring vs an inſtance of two Deacons appealing, Feliciſſimus & Vincentius. ſo as the Canon is trampled downe by your owne confeſſion, and yet the Biſhops allegation was of the Canon onely. Shall law, or practiſe be our Iudge? And yet when Gregory, refers the plaintiue Deacons ouer to a Synode, hee does but as the Canons had enacted before in that behalfe, namely, Nicen. can. 3. Antioch. can. 9. Conſtantinop. can. 2. What proofe then is this of Gregories authoritie to heare appeals, which rather he commits to the triall of Synods, as equitie would?
               § 17. And the ſame fault is in your next example. Certaine Prieſts of Africa complained againſt Paulinus, Donadeus a Deacon againſt Ʋictor his Biſhop. Yet you graunted euen now, that Prieſts and Deacons were barred Appeales, by the Canon, moſt euidently. What is this then to the matter, but that you want worke, and are faine to ſucke occaſion out of your fingers ends, that you may be doing? And in one word, when Gregorie ſo orders the matter vpon theſe fellowes complaints, that he refers the hearing to an aſſembly of Biſhops, with the primate of the Prouince, as you alleadge, either Victor, or Columbus, or whome you will, he ſhewes no authority, but onely does as the Canons had appointed to be done, whether he would or no. Indeed Gregorie profeſſes his reſpect to the Canons in diuerſe places, and herein he keepes it.
               §. 18. It followes, of certaine Popes, who exerciſed (he ſaith) vniuerſall authoritie in S. Auſtens dayes. Though I ſhewed that this neede not, becauſe no way thwarting the Biſhops words, yet briefly to his obiections, that he ſeeme not ouer wiſe in his owne conceit. S. Auſten ſaies of Zozim. Ep. 157. ad Opt. Iniuncta nobis à venerabili Papâ Zozimo Apoſtolicae ſedis Epiſcopo Eccleſiaſtica neceſſitas nos Caeſaream traxerat. The neceſſarie occaſions of the Church impoſed vpon me by

Pope Zozimus drew me to Caeſarea. And out of Poſſidius, Literae ſedis Apoſtolicae compulerunt. This may prooue violence, as well as authority, becauſe of trahere and compellere: Which ſurely Zozimus vſed not to S. Auſten. He lackt a learned man, and cald for S. Auſten, vſing his beſt intereſt to perſwade him. What is this to the Popedome? How many ſuch compellers could I ſhew you out of S. Auſten? Marcellinus for one, a temporall Earle, but an exceeding good man, and afterward Martyr, as we are told by S. Hierome. Sic 
                  Contra Pelag. lib. vlt. 
                  me compulit vel ipſa charitas tui Marcelline Comes, ſic inquam me compulit, ſic duxit, & traxit, &c. De peccat. meritis & remiſſ. l. 1. c. 1. Iuſt as the Apoſtle acknowledges of himſelfe, and all Chriſtians, Charitas Chriſti cogit nos, the loue of Chriſt conſtraines vs. So here the neceſſities of the Church did S. Auſten, recōmended to him by Pope Zozimus; yet with no more iuriſdiction perhaps, then Marcellinus had ouer him, which I thinke was but ſmall. The examples of this kind of phraſe, are rife euery where. We read in the booke of Samuel, that the witch conſtrained king Saul to eate meate. 1. Sam. 28. And Luk. 24. coegerunt eum, the two Diſciples that went into Emaus, conſtrained our Sauiour to tarry with them. Howbeit doubtleſſe not ſuperiour to him, ſpecially after his reſurrection. Abraham and Lot conſtrained their gueſts, as we may read in Geneſis, yet not giuing lawes I ſuppoſe to ſtrangers, which is condemned in another place of that booke, Peregrinus eſt, & vult dare leges, but to teach vs to enforce our liberalities and our courteſies, where modeſty Chryſ. in locum. reiects them, though neede craue them. And theſe gueſts were Angels. Which it were fine if you could bring vnder the Popes compulſion, as ſome of your men haue ſeriouſly laboured, to make the Pope paramount to the Angels themſelues; once, Abraham and Lot though no ſpirituall men, here conſtrained them for certaine. What ſpeake I of Scriptures? Euen Tully de Amicitiâ, Cogitis certè, quid enim refert quâ ratione cogatis? You conſtraine me (quoth Lelius) no matter how. And againe S. Auſten, Praef. librorum ad Simplicianum,

Quaeſtiunculas quas mihi enodandas iubere dignatus es. He ſayes, Simplician commaunded him to diſſolue queſtions. And yet, I take it, Simplician had no ſuch regular power ouer S. Auſten, as to command him. This iubere would haue troubled Pope Nicholas wonderfully. I neuer reade his Epiſtle ad Michaelem Imperatorem, but I pitty his paſſions, to ſee him ſo ſtormed with a poore iubere of the Emperour. Whereas the Emperour writing in all likelihood in Greek, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   might be conſtrued, wiſhing or exhorting, if either he or his interpretour had not been afraid of a blew ſpider, a dread where none was. But againe S. Auſten in the forenamed place, Cùm tibi placet quod ſcribo, noui cui placeat, quoniam qui te inhabitet noui. Hee meanes, that the holy Ghoſt dwels in Simplicianus, which would haue made a faire ſhew in a Popes ſtyle. Largitor enim omnium munerum per tuam ſententiam confirmauit obedientiam meam, &c. He ſpeakes of obedience yeelded to Simplician, who yet was not his ſuperiour. Againe, In meo miniſterio, dixit Deus fiat & factum eſt. (Hee calls it his miniſterie, or his ſeruice, and ſets him almoſt in the place of God.) In tuâ verò approbatione, vidit deus quia bonum eſt. At leaſt, there he makes him his God, or his ſuperiour directly. Generally of all Biſhops, thus wee read in S. Auſten, Epiſt. 168. In alijs ciuitatibus tantum agimus, quod ad eccleſiam dei pertinet, quaentum vel nos permittunt, vel NOBIS IMPONVNT earundem ciuitatum Epiſcopi,

                  fratres & conſacerdotes noſtri. What is leſſe in imponunt, then in the iniungunt that you vrge? Iniuncta nobis à Zozimo neceſſitas. Yet here you ſee, imponunt is an act that any Biſhop might exerciſe towards S. Auſten, euen his brothers and fellow-prieſts, [fratres & conſacerdotes,) not onely Zozimus. So Ruffinus in expoſit. ſymbol. ad Laurent. which Laurence was no Pope, though he be called Papa there,. i. a reuerent perſonage. One Laurentius ſtood with Symmachus for the Popedome, I graunt, but hee loſt it, as you knowe. Well, what ſaies Ruffinus? He calls it, pondus praecepti, becauſe Laurentius deſired him to put his expoſition which he

had preacht vpon the Creede, in writing; the weight of his charge, or the charge of his commandement. Againe, Aſtringis me vt aliquid tibi de ſide, &c. Yet Laurence had no power, that I know, of binding Ruffinus. Laſtly, expoſitionis à te impoſitae neceſſitatem, ſayes he, which anſwers word for word almoſt to that which you bring out of S. Auſten, Iniuncta nobis à Zozimo neceſſitas. But of Zozimus (ſaith hee) hereafter, wherein we will attend him.
               § 19. Firſt therefore of Liberius, a moſt wretched proofe. Certaine Arian hereticks obtained his letters for their reſtitution, Baſil. epiſt. 74. & 32. to the aſſemblie of Tyana, and by vertue of them they were reſtored, though they did but diſſemble, in that they feigned their conformitie with the Church of God, inwardly remaining deepe Arians. Is not this fit to be brought in behalfe of the Pope, to ſhew how wel he ſtands vpon his watch, how meete a man he is to inherit the truſt of all Chriſtian ſoules, that ſuffers ſuch knaues to beguile him in this ſort? As for that, that Liberius letters were of force; ſo ſhould any other graue and worthie Prelates haue been, vpon whoſe teſtimonie the Synod might relie; eſpecially when, if there had beene no doubt of their repentance, they ſhould haue needed no other mediatour happily then themſelues. But becauſe he hath quoted S. Baſil in the margent, let vs heare his words, and ſee what confidence he puts in Rome, or in the Biſhop thereof. Epiſt. 74. thus he ſaies of Liberius, and his reſtoring of Euſtathius that Arian heretick, which ſuſpition, to ſay truth, Liberius was not free from, enclining thither himſelfe when time was. The rather might he write in the behalfe of an Arian. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. Since therefore from thence (he meanes from Rome, and from the Weſterne Churches, this Epiſtle bearing inſcription to the 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the Biſhops of the West) ſince from thence he hath receiued power to hurt the Churches, and the libertie that you gaue him (Liberius with the reſt) he to the ſubuerſion of many hath abuſed, it is neceſſarie that reformation ſhould ſpring from

the ſame place, and that you ſhould ſend word to the Churches, for what cauſe he was receiued, and how beeing changed ſince in his opinion, he makes void the grace that was then giuen him (not by Liberius ſo much as by the Fathers, that is, they of the Councell of Tyana) of which before. And in the ſame Epiſtle, a little afore this place, S. Baſil giues two reaſons, why he implores the aide of the Italian Biſhops, in theſe words, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. The firſt is, becauſe if onely the Eaſterne Biſhops appeare againſt Euſtathius, it may be thought to come of emulation and partialitie, one Biſhop of the ſame countrey oppoſing another. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . But you the farther of, the better beleeued. Which, to ſay truth, hath alwaies bin the Popes felicitie. But you ſee he flies not to them for any vniuerſal authoritie or prerogatiue (as they imagin) frō 
                  Peter deriued, but for the diſtāce of the place, which makes them ſeeme to be more incorrupt. The ſecond reaſon is, from the conſenting of many Biſhops together, and the power of that to preuaile with peoples minds, when there ſhall be a concurrence, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is; But of with ioynt conſent many ſhall auerre the ſame thing, the very multitude of them that are of one minde, will make it to be entertained without contradiction. By which, you ſee, the Pope can doe little alone. And ſo ſpeakes Baſil in his greateſt extremitie, euen when he needes the Pope moſt. Elſe we know, how ſharply he can taxe Rome, and giue the Popes their owne, when occaſion ſerues.

Pollicentur pacē & communionem Iulio, ſi approbaret abdicationem factam, ſin reſiſteret decretis eorum, &c. They promiſe Iulius to be of his communion, if he will doe as they would haue him, if not, to leaue [that is, to diſclaime] him, you would ſay to excommunicate him, if it made for you. And indeede in the 10. Chap. of Sozomene, ſoone after, they doe ſo in good earneſt.
               § 21. The next is Damaſus. In whom I muſt bee ſhort. What tell you vs of titles, and tearmes, and ſtyles? what though they called him moſt bleſſed Lord, raiſed to the height of Apoſtolique dignitie, holy father of fathers, Damaſus Pope, &c. Thinke you, that the boyes would forbeare laughter, hearing this argument? That the Biſhops of Africa call him Damaſum Papam, Pope Damaſus, &c. therefore Damaſus Pope might receiue appeales out of Africa. If that be not in their ſtyle, the reſt is vulgar, and nothing to the matter. Who was not Papa in thoſe dayes? which you engroſſing, bewray your ſelues. Yea, but nothing might goe for currant concerning important affaires, as depoſition of Biſhops, ſay you, niſi ad noticiam veſtrae ſedis delatum fuerit, vnleſſe your Sea knew of it.

§ 22. But is not that a braue confuting of the Mileuitan Canon, alleadged by the Biſhop againſt appeales beyond the ſea, that S. Hierome ſought to Damaſus for his iudgement about Hypoſtaſis? This alſo may prooue an appeale in time, when appeales grow ſcant. It hath been anſwered by our Diuines, ouer and ouer: it is nothing to our queſtion, therfore I inſiſt not vpon it. Neither yet that of Ambroſe (if it be Ambroſe) who liuing within Italy, that is Damaſus his prouince, ſaies, Damaſus gouerned the houſe of God, the houſe no doubt, wherein hee liued, and wrote at that day. But how if he had called it, as it followes in S. Paul, columnam 
                  1. Tim. 3. 
                  & firmamentum veritatis, which S. Paul does Epheſus, wherein Timothy liued? yet neither Epheſus that infallible one, that you imagine Rome to be, for truth of doctrine, nor Timothy a monarch or vniuerſall Biſhop.
               § 23. That Peter of Alexandria was reſtored to his Biſhopricke vpon Damaſus his letters: you ſhewe not they were mandatorie, we thinke rather commendatorie. Damaſus certified good things of Peter, and the people receiued him, illis confiſus, truſting they might be true; or, they did what they deſired and longed to doe, vpon ſo good a hint. The Pope gaue not Patriarkſhips in

               § 24. 
                     Ʋitalis an heretique, and an Antiochian, was examined, and cenſured by Pope Damaſus. But you diſſemble not that Paulinus their Biſhop permitted it. The wonder had beene, if Damaſus had intermedied againſt his conſent. One Biſhop may referre his Prieſt, to be examined by another whome he will. Things were not ſo well ſetled with Paulinus at this time in Antioch, as it ſhould ſeeme, through inteſtine diſcords, which long continued. So Damaſus might preſcribe a forme of abiuration to 
                     Ʋitalis the heretique, though otherwiſe preſcribe is but an imperious word of

your owne deuiſing, and to draw him a forme, which he meant ſhould be vſed by him vpon his returne to Antioch, had beene enough. Your author whome you quote, in Ep. 
                  Elias Cretenſ. 2. ad Cledon. ſaies onely thus; Damaſo poſtulante edidit, or, literis conſignauit fidem: at Damaſus his inſtāce he pen'd a forme of his beleife: not Damaſus for him, but he to Damaſus. Which Athanaſius alſo did at the Emp. Iouians requeſt, not to purge Theod. hiſtor. lib. 4. cap. 2. ſuſpicion, but to inſtruct him in the truth. Of preſcribing to Paulinus, I read nothing in that place. In Damaſus his Epiſtle Tom. 1. Concil. Ep. 1. Damaſ. I finde this qualification, both that tuae voluntati & tuo iudicto omnia derelinquimus, we leaue all to your will, and your iudgement: and in the ende this, Non quòd haec ipſa quae ſcribimus, non potueris conuertentium ſuſceptioni proponere, ſed quò noſter conſenſus liberum in ſuſcipiendo tibi tribuat exemplū: Not that you could not of your owne ſelfe haue propounded theſe things to conuerts, ere they were receiued, but that our concurrence might yeeld you freedome of example to receiue them. And if freedome, how preſcription?
               
               § 25. It is a wonder, how you dare mention the name of Flauianus, who by the Emperors fauour kept his ſeat againſt Theod. l. 5. c. 23. ſo many Popes one after another, ſtriuing to vnhorſe him, and all in vaine. The paines that Chryſoſtome and Theophilus tooke, to make a peace betweene him and Damaſus, ſhewed their good care of the Churches vnity, and worthily entitles them to the bleſſing of peacemakers. But that which you call pardoning Flauianus offence, and reſtoring him to the communion of the Church againe, was no more then was vſuall in thoſe dayes, between Biſhop and Biſhop, if they miſliked one another, to forbeare communicating mutually; if ſatisfaction were giuen, to returne to fellowſhip and communion againe, which you perhaps, to amplifie the Popes power, would haue vs think to be excommunication and abſolution. Where you ſay, that the people of Antioch, were IN TIME REDVCED to concord and vnitie, with Flavianus their Biſhop, through this act of Damaſus, it ſhewes it was rather the relenting of their

mindes, and appeaſing their ſtomacks, out of Flavianus good demeanure, and other ſuch conſiderations, then the Popes ſentence, or bare definition. For then what neede long time to worke it? Neither was that a ſigne of Damaſus his ſupremacie, that Flavianus ſent his embaſſage to Rome. For when two are to meete, why ſhould not the inferiour come to the ſuperiour, rather then otherwiſe? I meane inferiour in order, as Flavianus here to Damaſus, Antioch to Rome, but not in authoritie. Though the embaſſage was not intended ſo much to Damaſus, as to cleere the ſcandall that went of Flavian, and to ſatisfie the whole Church of God in thoſe parts, that Eaſt and Weſt might no longer continue in iealouſie and alienation.
               § 26. And now to come to his ſucceſſor Syricius, as your owne words are, how doe you prooue his vniuerſall iuriſdiction? I know it wrings you to be held to this point, but there is no remedy, to that you muſt ſpeake. Forſooth the Councell of Capua, committed the hearing of Flauianus his cauſe to the Biſhop of Alexandria and the Biſhop of Egypt, with this limitation, as S. Ambroſe witneſſes (I report your owne words) that the approbation and confirmation of their ſentence ſhould be reſerued to the Roman ſea, and the Biſhop thereof, who was then Syricius. Suppoſe this were ſo, how farre is it from arguing vniuerſall iuriſdiction? For as the Councell might make choice of the Biſhop of Alexandria, and the Biſhops of Egypt, to take the firſt knowledge of Flavianus his cauſe into their hands, ſo, out of the ſame authoritie, might it reſerue the after iudgement, and the vp ſhot of all, to the Biſhop of Rome: it might doe this, I ſay, out of it owne libertie, and for the perſonall worth of Syricius Pope, not for any prerogatiue of his Sea. And rather it ſhewes the preheminence of the Councell, that might depute the Pope to ſuch a buſines, as likewiſe the Biſhop of Alexandria and Egypt. The Euſebians made an offer (witnes Athanaſius in his Apologie) to Iulius Pope of Rome, to be their iudge, if he thought good; Iulio ſi vellet arbitrium cauſae detulerunt. But

if Iulius had no other hold, it was a poore ſupremacie that might content him. Yet Ambroſe, in the Epiſtle 78. which you quote, ſaies not ſo much. Rather of Theophilus ſomewhat magnificently, Vt duobus iſtis tuae ſanctitatis examen impartiretur, confidentibus Aegyptijs, that your Holines might haue the ſcanning of theſe mens cauſe, while the Biſhops of Egypt were your aſſeſſors. And againe, Sancta Synodus, cognitionis ius unanimitati tuae, caeteriſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ex Aegypto conſacerdotibus noſtris commiſit. The holy Synod (of Capua) committed the power of iudging this matter to your agreement, and the Egyptian Biſhops. What then of the Pope? Sanè referendum arbitramur ad ſanctum fratrem noſtrum Romanae ſacerdotem Eccleſiae. Sure, we are of the minde, that it were good it were referred to our holy brother the Prieſt of Rome. Firſt brother, then Prieſt of Rome, laſtly arbitramur. The Synod belike not ordering ſo, but Ambroſe giuing his opinion thus. And, Quoniam praeſumimus te ea iudicaturum quae etiam illi displicere nequeant, becauſe we preſume you will reſolue in ſuch manner, as ſhall not be displeaſing to him. See you, how one of them is as free from error, as the other, in S. Ambroſe minde? And he is content, that Syricius ſhould haue the cognuſance of the cauſe after Theophilus, not that Theophilus errour might be corrected by Syricius, but that ones concurrence might ſtrengthen the other.
               § 27. Doe you looke I ſhould anſwer to Syricius Decretall ſent to Himerius? or does the conueying of it, to France and Portugall, prooue vniuerſall iuriſdiction, exerciſed by the Popes in S. Auſtens time? But with ſuch baggage you make vp your meaſure. Himerius askt, and Syricius anſwers. What then? And Himerius was within the Romane Patriarchſhip, caput corporis tai, not caput corporis vniuerſalis, ſaies Syricius himſelfe, in the ende of his Reſcript. But proceede. Optatus (ſay you) calls Peter principem noſtrum, our Prince. Now he could not meane Peter to be that Prince, for he was dead and gone, and ſo nothing worth. Therefore Siricius who then liued, and was his ſucceſſor in the Popedome. Brauely ſhott, and like a Sadducee. Yet in the ſame booke, Optatus calls Siricius
                  
in plaine tearmes, not princeps noſter, but ſocius noſter, our frend and fellow, as S. Ambroſe a little before, his brother and prieſt.
               
               § 28. That, in the African Councell, Can. 35. the Fathers decreed, that letters ſhould be ſent to their brethren and fellow-Biſhops abroad, but eſpecially to Anaſtaſius, to informe them, how neceſſary their latter decree was, in fauour of the Donatiſts, contradicting a former Canon made againſt them, what is that to Anaſtaſius his vniuerſall iuriſdiction? Doe you ſee how you are choaked, if you be but held to the point? yet they ſent to others, no leſſe then to Anaſtaſius. But to him eſpecially, you ſay. It might be ſo; for the eminencie of his Sea, as we haue often told you. And the Donatiſts beeing too ſtrong for them, as appeares by that decree, which controules the former, they were glad to take any aduantage, I warrant you, to countenance their proceedings. Durum telum neceſſitas eſt.
               
               § 29. That, the Biſhops of Africa requeſted Innocentius to vſe his authoritie, to the confirmation of their ſtatutes againſt the Pelagian heretiques; it was not becauſe the ordinances of prouinciall Synods, are not good in their precincts, without the Pope, as I thinke your ſelues will not denie, but that the Pelagian hereſie beeing farre ſpread throughout the world, might be curbed within the places that Innocentius had to doe in, as well as in Africk, where the Councel was held.

But making it but negligence, he ſhewes they ſought for aduice onely, or countenance, not for leaue and grace, when they referred to him. Whereas S. Auſten had ſpoke, of the Popes applying his paſtorall diligence, to preuent the daungers of Chriſts weake members, F.

As if no bodie had confuted his confutation of thoſe Anſwers, which the Reader of himſelfe is able to doe, I dare ſay, if he haue peruſed but the former part of this booke, without any further paines to be taken in that behalfe. And yet euery where he remits vs to what hee hath done, and ſaid, as altogether vnconquerable. Now for that which is ſo firme in the Biſhops Anſwer, as not to be remooued by any meanes, that he railes at and calls ſtale: elſe 
                     S. Hilarie profeſſes of himſelfe to doe ſo, vt recens lectio & collata reſponſis invitis etiam & cō

De Trin. lib 6. why cannot he iterate his refutation againe, as well as the Biſhop repeat his Anſwer? but it ſhames him, that ſo many Arguments ſhould ſtumble at one ſtone, Iudg. 9. like the ſonnes of Gedeon, beheaded by Abimelech all at one blocke: and therfore he falls to carping and deprauing.

ſhewed the errour, and not let the Cardinals fallacies to paſſe for currant.

Which were hard to alleadge now, for the proouing of Peters excellencie aboue the other Apoſtles, though we would argue for the Cardinall out of the Cardinals owne workes. For example, what can be more for Peters Monarchy ouer the Church, then to ſay, that he onely was made cheife Regent therof? And yet ſumma poteſtas, is by the Cardinall made common to all the Apoſtles, not once, but twice, within fewe lines, cap. 9. l. 1. de Rom.

Yet thus he writes, lib. 1. de Pont. Rom. cap. 12. Non negat Auguſtinus ad literam poſſe & debere intelligi quae dicuntur de Iudâ, Petro, & Iohanne: Sed tantùm dicit literalem ſenſum ſaepe eſſe obſcurum, & non facilè inueniri, ſenſum autem myſticum eſſe multò illuſtriorem & clariorem, & proptereà ſe omiſſo literali figuratè ea exponere loca voluiſſe. That is, S. Auguſtine denieth not, (ſo as hee would bring S. Auguſt. too within the compaſſe of this dotage) that things ſaid of Peter, Iudas, and Iohn, both may and ought to be literally vnderſtood, but onely he ſaies, that the literall ſenſe is ofttimes obſcure, and hard to ſinde out (where I wonder ſaies S. Auguſt. ſo?) but that the myſticall ſenſe is He quotes Trac. vl

forſooth. This is the conſtancie of theſe men, that as Benhadad for feare and guilty conſcience, ran from chamber to chamber, ſo they to avoide what makes againſt them, change ſenſe for ſenſe, ſometime literall for allegoricall, then allegoricall for the literall, about the words ſpoken to Peter by our Sauiour. The former they thinke they may doe with S. Auguſt. and avouch him for it; there the allegory is the cleerer; As for the latter, they will not endure that Origen ſhould doe ſo, by any meanes. Here all is ſpoild, vnleſſe you ſtick to the Letter: And a Chaos, a confuſion is brought in by vs, Lay folk and Clerks, Men and Women, promiſcuouſly inuading both the keyes and the office, no difference left, nor ſigne of difference, if we allowe of this. Thus he. But howſoeuer you rowle and ruffle in your Rhetorique, declaiming againſt the ſuppoſed Anarchy of our Church, and not diſcerning (which euen Balaam did) the beauty of thoſe tents, to which you are a profeſſed enemy, (ſo thicke is the fogge of your malitious ignorance, that ſtuffes vp your ſenſes;) I beleeue Sir, the keyes are conueighed to the commonalty rather by you then vs, and to the worſer ſexe too (not ſo to be honoured) as in your Abbeſſes to be gouernours, in your goſſips to be dippers and baptiſers, and I knowe not what.

Neither if Origen extend this to more then Peter, muſt it therefore preſently be communicated to all; There are Apoſtles beſides Peter, there are Paſtors beſides the Apoſtles, there are the iuſt and faithfull of all ſorts, beſides diuers that belong to the bodie of the Church in ſhew. It is not neceſſary we ſhould open ſo great a gappe as you thinke, though wee take Origen litterally. Though this I muſt tell you, that Origen in all likelihood would not haue applied it ſo by allegory, vnleſſe he had ſtretched it

beyond Peter, in the very property. For aſſurance whereof conſider his words. Si ſuper vnum illum Petrum exiſtimas aedificari totam 
                  in Matth. 16. Tract. 1.

                        que
                     ? If thou thinkeſt the whole Church is built onely vpon Peter, what wilt thou ſay of Iohn the ſonne of thunder, what of euerie one of the Apoſtles beſides? It ſeemes incredible firſt to Origen, that the whole Church ſhould bee built vpon one man onely, though it were Peter himſelfe. Therefore he inſiſts vpon totam Eccleſiam, and conſiderately oppoſeth vnum illum. And makes the one but exiſtimas, or ſi exiſtimas, If thou thinkeſt ſo (ſaith he) by Peter, but the other is, quid dicturus es, how wilt thou anſwer it, how wilt thou defend it, againſt Iohn, and againſt the reſt? And ſure as Origen was of the minde, that no Apoſtle of the Twelue, ſate out from beeing a foundation of the Church, in the ſenſe that Peter was, ſo hee names Iohn you ſee in particular, of whome afterwards you ſhall ſee how great opinion he conceiued, and how ful of reuerence, not inferiour to Peter. In the meane while it is euident how he pleades for the Apoſtles all in generall, whom he cannot digeſt to be denied this priuiledge, of ſupporting the frame equally with Peter. For which cauſe he deales ſo peremptorily, and takes vp his aduerſarie, as we noted before, Si exiſtimas Petrum, quid dicturus es de caeteris, &c. Which differs from his moral collection, as you call it, which is a great deale more mawdlen, where he affirmes by fortaſſe, Fortaſſe autem quod Petrus reſpondens dixit, &c. Perhaps if we ſay the ſame that Peter ſaid, wee ſhall be priuiledged like him: this is but perhaps. Yea, the practiſe of the Church implyes no leſſe, then we now ſtand for, which Origen there declares towards the ende of his diſcourſe. Quoniam ij qui Epiſcoporum locum ſibi vindicant, vtuntur eo dicto ſicut Petrus, & claues regni coelorum acceperunt, &c. Becauſe they that are Biſhops, take this to themſelues, euen as Peter, and haue receiued the keies of the kingdome of heauen. Heare you? not euerie Chriſtian now, nor predeſtinate man, which is his morall
                  
doctrine, and offends you ſo mainly, but the Biſhops, good Sir, the Biſhops in ſpeciall take this to belong to them, and claime the keyes. Is not this a ſigne the keyes were committed to all the Apoſtles? For the communitie of Biſhops deſcendes from all the Apoſtles; If the Keies had been Peters onely, onely the Pope ſhould claime them, pretending Hierm. ad Euag. Omnes Ep

               § 4. Now when you tell vs, that Origen neuer mentions in this place the commiſſion of feeding, paſce oues meas, (though the Biſhop brings this place to anſwer the other by, about Summa rerum de ouibus paſcendis, out of his Commentary vpon Rom. 6.) and ſo the Biſhops anſwer fits not with the obiection: You are to know, that

If, Tibi dabo claues, belong to them all, and ſpecially, if, Super te aedificabo eccleſiam meam, ſo doth Paſce oues too, by proportion, either equall, or maioris virtutis, as they call it. For what ſo ſingular and ſo individuate, as Super te aedificabo? Sure, paſce oues, is not ſo much. The one a promiſe, the other a precept, and precept is not broken, if it extend to many, promiſe either is, or is the weaker for it, without all doubt. And yet Origen himſelfe teacheth you as much in this tractate, as it were preuenting your obiection, when thus he ſaith towards the middle of it: Si dictum hoc commune eſt caeteris, cur non ſimul omnia velut dicta ad Petrum tamē
                     ſunt omnium communia? That is, If this belong to all, though ſpoken to Peter, (as he doubts not but it does) why not all the reſt then, though directed to him, yet are to be meant of all?
               § 5. Another place you quote out of the ſame Origen, vnquoted by the Cardinall, but belike to help him, poſt aciem inclinatam, out of Hom. 2. in diuerſa Euang. namely that Peter

                  , in Martial, let your Pope in good earneſt take heed of Hercules, wearing three Crownes, and not content with more then three mens parts. Of vertex too much, whether in ieſt or earneſt, vnleſſe the argument were better. We are ſpeaking of Origen, and his ſecond Hom. in diuerſa. Are ye aduiſed therefore what priuiledges he heapes vpon S. Iohn there, not inferiour to Peter, not to any? for it is not for nothing, that Iohn ſtill croſſes Peter, though the one ſet out former, yet the other arriuing firſt at his iournies end, Ioh. 20. Cui donatum eſt (ſaies Origen) quod tibi donatum eſt, ô beate? To whome was it euer giuen, that which to thee hath been giuen, O thou bleſſed creature? Dic quaeſo, cui talis ac tanta donata eſt gratia? I pray thee tell me; To whom euer was ſuch and ſo great grace conferred? Feare you not leaſt hee deface the Virgins garland, not onely Peters? And as Peter is a rocke, by interpretation, as you tell vs, ſo Iohn (if wee beleeue Origen) Latinè, quod donatum eſt, as if a packe of gifts were couched in him, and the ſpecialleſt gift, that euer befell a man, (either the Monarchy then belike, or aboue the Monarchy,) another one in degree, to whom that may befit, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , you know the place. And indeed no writer ſpeakes of Peter, as if he had all gifts in him. S. Ambroſe
                  
diuides them between Peter and Paul, ſerm. 66. One had one key, another another. Ille ſcientiae, iſte potentiae. And iſte erudit ad ſalutem, ille ſuſcipit ad quietem. Paul in this life, Peter in the next. Neither doth this much make for the Popes preheminencies, who is not ſo ſimple, as to reſerue himſelfe for Paradiſe, rather all for the world preſent, which was made (they ſay) for the preſumptuous. Yea, moſt plainely in the ſame Sermon, Quis cui praeponatur incertum eſt. S. Ambroſe knowes not which to preferre. Wherein Bellarmine is more happie; for he ſaies, Paulus plus profuit

As Stephen a Deacon is more honoured in his memorie, The Pope a Poly-Stephen for his triple crown ſake. (ſaith hee) then S. Iames an Apoſtle (why ſhould hee ſtrike at Iames aboue all the reſt?) Laurence then Sixtus, &c. Neither is this peculiar to Bellarmine, but all the Ieſuites ought to be of this mind. For they propounded S.

                  Paulus Apoſtolus Petro [etſi] Apoſtolorum primo, in principatu Apoſtolico frater eſt. What is this but equalitie, in principatu, in the cheifedom it ſelfe? Eucher. in Natal. Apoſt. Petri & Pauli, calls them aequali per terram luce fulgentes, ſhining all ouer the world with equall brightnes. Laſtly, all the ſolution that S. Ambr. can finde of his doubt, is this, by reducing it to their titles; that one is Petra, the other Vaſculum, both of them neceſſaria domni ſaluatoris, each neceſſarie to our Lords houſe.

                  Paul feeds and releeues the houſhold, whiles Peters vertue is buried vnder ground, like the foundation of an houſe, & as it were leaſt in ſight. Though for my part, I confeſſe, I can hardly conceiue how this holds, or how Peter ſtands the Church in ſuch ſtead, to lie vnder it, as you would ſay, to this very time. In a houſe, I graunt, S. Gregor. ſayes, l. 28. in Iob c. 6. that, In ſacriloquio, &c. he neuer finds the word foundatiō
                      put in the ſingular, throughout al Scripture, but onely for Chriſt. Yet the Papiſts make Peter a ſingular foundation, and by himſelfe. See Haymo com. in Eph. 2. where he will not ſo much as conſtrue that, Fundati ſuper fund. Proph. & Apoſt. otherwiſe thē thus, That Chriſt alone is the foundation of Praphets, of Apoſtles, and all: and he addes out of Matth. 16. Super hanc petram, i. ſuper me aedificabo Eccleſiam.
                   the foundation is of moſt vſe. But ſuch a Foundation, who can lay but Chriſt? 1. Cor. 3. 11. S. Pauls benefit of feeding vs, that is of inſtructing vs, is daily, and obuious, and intelligible. Therefore by my conſent, the prerogatiue ſhall reſt with him ſtill. But leauing Ambroſe, to whom we haue digreſſed, returne we to Origen, and conclude of him in a word. Concerning Iohn he addes; Fortaſſe quis dicet, tantundem Petro collatum. Happily a man may ſay, S. Peter had as much beſtowed on him; but he denies it in the next words, and more plainely ſoone after; Sed non temerè quis dixerit, &c. yea, how high he riſes? Non ergò Iohannes erat homo, ſed pluſquam homo. Therefore Iohn was no man, but more then a man. How would this ſerue the Popes turne, had it been ſaid of Peter, and if the Canoniſts had the handling of it? Who not onely ſalute him with Dominus Deus Papa, euen in their late editions of ſuch ſlattering Gloſſes, as they haue deckt their Law with, which perhaps might be excuſed, either by Dij ſunt multi, Domini

Capiſtranus. 
                  Ens conflatum ex Deo & homine, a certaine medley of God and man. But beeing affirmed of Iohn, as it is by Origen, I hope here Mr. F. T. will giue way to allegories, to quench the fire, which elſe theſe words might kindle verie dangerous, and not vrge him to maintaine the letter too preciſely. Laſtly, thus: Whiles Iohn was leaning vpon our Sauiours breaſt,

and ſo ſafe, and well appaid, Peter often tripped, ſaepe titubabat, quaſi trepidae actionis ſymbolum, ſayes Origen; not the rocke of faith nowe, immooueable, impregnable, but the picture of the actiue part of our life, weake, and fraile, and faint, and tottering. This of Origen.
               
               § 6. In S. Hilaries words, and your exception to the Of S. Hilar. teſtimonie. Biſhops anſwer to them, there remaines onely theſe two points to be cleered. One, that you ſay S. Hilary ſo aſcribes it to the faith of Peter, to be petra digna aedificatione Chriſti, a rock worthie of Chriſts building vpon, as yet withall he denyes it not to his very perſon. Another, that you affirme in plaine termes, it was the merit of his faith which purchaſed him this. 
                   Which is firſt very inſolent (for I beginne with your later)  that faith ſhould be a meritour at Gods hands, or a meritreſſe, if you will haue it ſo (I pray correct me, if I ſpeake amiſſe, for you ſee whether your abſurdities lead me) wheras Charity not faith is the fons meriti, the actuall deſeruer, by condignity at leaſt, as your ſelues hold; for ex longinquo is another thing, and expraeuiâ diſpoſitione, &c. Where in truth you are ſo dazeled about this merit of Peters, that you ſay you know not what, aſcribing that to his charity which is more proper to his faith, and againe that to his faith which belongs to his charitie. To be cheife in feeding you aſcribe to his Loue, to Amas me plus his? Which is true in our Sauiours Ioh. 21. ſenſe, for exciting his care, not in yours to inueſt him in the ſupreame iuriſdiction, which rather requires the priuiledge of freedome from errour. And here, his deſeruing to be the rock, or the principall, for bearing ſway, you impute it to his faith, which is too yong to be a deſeruer, if it be Abſolute Pelagianiſme. See S. Auſten, &c. not otherwiſe accommodated, euen by your own doctrine. This is one abſurdity therefore. Secondly, that he ſhould merit to be the rocke of the Church, whereas a man canot merit, that is not firſt in the Church, (as yourſelues will not deny) and ſo preſuppoſeth the foundation is laid. But in no ſort, can one merit to be the foundation thereof himſelfe.

Peter is nothing ſo. But eſpecially, if you will take to that of Maximus, whom you quote a little after, that S. Peter for rowing in a frigot or ſmall boate, was made Maſter and gouernour of the Vniuerſall Church. for what merit could there be, of that in this?

Peter for ſteering his materiall veſſell at the ſea, ſhould be preferred to ſit in the higheſt place of the Church, and congregation of God. Thirdly, if this were true that you auouch of his merits, S. Peter ſhould not only haue merited for himſelfe, but for as many monſters & miſcreants, as euer ſate after him in that ſea; Which you doe well to ſhroud vnder the merits of S.

allowe no qualification of S. Hilaries word? Whereas they that haue but taſted the auncient writers, know that to merite, is to obtaine and procure, though by grace and fauour, and no further to be vrged. He attained then (ſaith S. Hilary) a ſupereminent glory. Which glory may be in many Lib. 6. de trin. things, beſide his primacie, as the Biſhop anſwered you of

Peters faith to he the foundation of the Church that he excludeth his perſon, &c. Neuertheleſſe I would not haue him to thinke, that in affirming with S. Hilarie, that Peter was the foundation of the Church, I doe exclude his faith frō his perſon, as though S. Hilar. ſhould ſay, or any Catholike man meane, that the Church was built vpon Peters perſon, and not vpon his faith, &c. Fearing leaſt another ſhould depraue him as he hath done the Biſhop. faith, & his faith with his perſon, which is the ſecond point of the twaine, about which you ſweat, and trauell ſore, caſting vp mole-hils, and muſtering your Metaphyſicks long vnskoured, the Biſhop neuer dreamt, as you fantaſtically imagine, that S. Hilary ſhould giue this to a fleeting ſhadow, or to faith without a ſubiect, like your Accidents in the Euchariſt, which you welcome as well, as S. Iames his hoſte doth his gueſts, that biddes them warme themſelues without a fire, feede without victualls, and ſo you them to ſit down without a chaire, or a ſtoole: Not ſo: But if faith be the proper foundation of the Church, as S. Hilary implies by his fiue-fold repetition, Haec fides, haec fides, &c. 
                  Haec fides Eccleſiae fundamentum eſt, per han

                   then was Peter, in behalfe of his faith onely, pronounced by our Sauiour the foundation of the Church. Which is another thing then to be preferred, for the merit of his faith, to be the Churches foundation, as you fondly dreame. For ſo it might fall out, that he ſhould ſtill remaine the foundation of the Church, though he had caſt of his faith, wherewith he beganne, which will not ſtand with S. Hylaries conceit of it, and accordingly, none other are at any time

to bee reckoned the foundations of the Church, but they that ſhall tread in the ſteps of faithfull Peter, howſoeuer otherwiſe they may come neere him in calling. For where is more promiſed to Peters ſucceſſors, by vertue of meere ſucceſſion, then to Abrahams children? Rom. 4. Nay, the adoptiue branch may not challenge ſo much to it ſelfe, as the naturall, Rom. 11. Succeſſion (ſaith Greg. Nazianzen) is oft-times

               § 8. By this alſo the other places of S. Hilary are declared, Beatus Simon ſubiacens aedificationi eccleſiae: (ſcil) poſt ſacramenti confeſſionens. where he proceeds to call Peter the foundation of the Church, as you expound them; his perſon, I graunt, if ought at all, as the Biſhop alſo meant, (not a qualitie without a ſubiect, which is your chimaera) but in reſpect of his vertue, not of his authoritie ſingular. And as all the faithfull may Idem Hilar. eodem libro, tres columnas eccleſiarum facit, Petrum, Iohannem, & Iacobum. In the ſame place S.

Yet in producing Witneſſes, is it not reaſon that you ſhould call them by their proper and right names, or elſe they looſe the force of their credite for depoſition? And this was all, that the Biſhop made ſticke at, concerning that point.
               § 11. Now to the authority it ſelfe, & the Biſhops anſwer thereto; Quanti igitur merits apud Deum ſuum Petrus, which

you perſiſt to conſtrue, Of how great merit was Peter with his God, (ſo hardly are you driuen with the dogge from his licourment) as if Peters merit had beene to rowe the boat, and his reward to be made the gouernour of the world, whereas the indifferent tranſlator would rather haue conſtrued it thus, Of how great intereſt, or how great account, therefore, was Peter with his God, (antecedens pro conſequente, which your Rhetorique cannot be ignorant of, that quote Quintilian 
                  Adioynd. cap. 9. afterward, about the trope Catachreſis) who after the rowing of a little boate, had the gouernement of the whole Church committed to him? Thus Maximus. And the more to blame you then, as the Biſhop well anſwers you, to aſſigne him the gouernment of a particular Church (Peter I meane) & ſo in effect to rob him of the 
                     Ʋniuerſall. For we deny not, but that both he, and his fellow Apoſtles, had the whole Church committed to their care, ioyntly and ſeuerally, without any limitation. And ſurely Maximus his words import no more. As for that the Biſhop ſaies, that Y O V haue giuen him the gouernment of a particular Church, after the gouernment of the whole, haue not You, I

ſeate elſe where then at Rome, when ſo ſeemes good. Only, piè wee muſt beleeue, that hee will not doe ſo in haſt. Howbeit Bellar. de Pont. Rom. lib. 4. c. 4. if wee ſhould deny that he was euer at Rome, as ſome haue bin mooued by no weak grounds to do, as both collections out of Scripture, and ſupputations of the time when he ſhould arriue there, yet your argument is ſtrange whereby you would approoue it here, in your num. 15. where you ſay, it is demonſtrated, and as it were proclaimed, by the continuall ſucceſſions of Biſhops in that Sea, to this very day. Call you this a demonſtration of Peters being at Rome, that Biſhops neuer failed in that Sea, to this day, ergò S. Peter was the firſt that ſate there? Though againe it were no hard matter, to diſprooue the continuance of your Biſhops in that Sea, euen at ſundry ſeaſons, By ſchiſmes, by ſimonies, by tranſmigrations, ſometime alſo by pluralitie of incū
                     bents. As Felix and Liberius, Sozom. l. 4. c. 14. But cheifly whereas the Papiſts challenge other Seas to haue fayled in their ſucceſſion of Biſhops, we may truely anſwer them, that it had beene more for their credit to haue had none at all, then diuerſe ſuch as they are faine to ſhew to vphold theirs, of late times. if it were pertinent to this place. But howſoeuer that be, you ought to bring a more colourable argument of Peters ſitting there as I take it. For of many that I haue heard, this is ſimply the ſimpleſt. Neither is that much better, which you vaunt farre more in, if it be poſſible, writing thus in the ſame numb. And withall he addes a ſtrange Parentheſis [quaſi ea totius pars non eſſet] as though the ſame particular Church of Rome were not a part of the whole. As who would ſay, that S. Peter could not be gouernour, both of the whole Church, and of a particular Church. Wherein, he argueth as wiſely, as if he ſhould ſay, that a Biſhop of Ely could not be gouernour of the particular Church of Ely, and of the whole Dioceſe; or that a Biſhop of Canterbury could not be gouernour of that Biſhopricke, and primate of England; or that a generall of an army could not gouerne a particular company, and yet be generall of the whole army. And here, though you would ſeeme to haue triumphed ouer the Biſhop, in your impregnable inſtances, yet you ſhew, it wrings you at the very heart, to bee ſo met with about Maximus his authoritie, when in your numb. following you ſet him downe both in Text, and Margent, for a man whoſe

head ſhould be confounded with blowes, rather then confuted with arguments. So notable a champion you are at your Iſmaels Logicke, whoſe fiſt was againſt euery body, and euerie bodies againſt his, which Philo interprets to be the image of a diſputer, but like none ſo much as the Popiſh diſputants (you may ſay they diſpute in Schola Tyranni, Act. 19.) from whoſe butcherly hands, I pray God deliuer vs, that euen thus declare their fingers to be itching, till they may deale with vs.
               § 12. As for the Biſhoprick of Rome, ioyned or adioyned to the Biſhopricke of the whole Church, which you would patterne with the Dioceſſe and Church of Ely, recommended to the gouernment of one man, or the gouernment of a whole army, and one company in that army, entruſted to the care of the ſame generall, and ſuch like; how vnlike are theſe compariſons, I report me to your conſcience!  For the gouernment of that company, which  is a limbe of the maine army, while it remaines ſo, is impoſſible to be diuided from the gouernment of the whole, and ſo Ely Church from Ely Dioceſſe is not ſo eaſily ſeparated, in ordine currente, as now things goe; but he that hath the one muſt needes haue the other. But your ſelues hold, that the Biſhopricke of the whole world, hath beene actually diuided from the Biſhopricke of Rome, as namely while Peter ſate at Antioch, before he came to Rome, to ſay nothing of your later Popes, that lay ſoaking at Auenion ſeuenty yeares together: wherupon Bellarmine graunts, as you heard euen now, that they may be diuided againe, if occaſion ſo require,

But the maine point lyes in this:  That the Biſhop of Ely, hath no new induction to his Church of Ely, more then was giuen him at firſt entrance vpon the entire Biſhopricke, and ſo 

the generall of an army, hath no newe conſtitution ouer a part of his army, after hee is admitted Generall ouer the whole. Whereas you giuing to S. Peter the whole Church for his Biſhopricke, if afterwards he take vp his ſeate in Rome, by a more peculiar title, what doth he but extinguiſh his former cleane? which, I thinke, will hold euen in Fitzherberts Law.
               § 13. Neither ſay that S. Iames was Biſhop of Hieruſalem, and yet gouernour of the whole Church, with the reſt of his colleagues: for Iames was extraordinarie as you alſo confeſſe: but ſhew that one man may be ordinarie Paſtor of the whole Church, and yet ordinarie Paſtor of a part too, by a ſecond title diſtinct from the former; or elſe you ſay nothing, but palter about the Biſhops anſwer to Maximus, and bewray a manifeſt contradiction in your doctrine.

                   before, and nothing was left for Paul though deſeruing. Yea he addes, that our Sauiour in his prouidence choſe him, peculiarem quodam modo ducem, a captaine (of his Church) in a manner ſingular, and without fellow. Erat enim tam praecipuus,

&c. vt ad eccleſiae ſolatium, & ad firmamentum omnium credentium, Chriſtus eum vocaret è caelo. Hee was ſo ſingular (in his gift) that to the comfort of his Church, and the ſupport of all the faithfull, (firmamentum credentium not inferiour to petra) our Lord directly called him from heauen. Laſtly, Vt aduerteret princeps futurus nominis Chriſtiani, that he which was to bee the prince of the name Chriſtian, that is, the moſt eminent in all the Chriſtian congregation, might marke, &c. As for the third Sermon of that argument, which is that from whence the words, Quanti meriti, are quoted, whereunto the Biſhop anſwers: it followes immediately after them in the praiſe of Peter, thus of Paul: That Paul in his Apoſtleſhip, how highly did he pleaſe Chriſt? (where you ſee meritum is counterpoized by placere, indeed all one) who is his owne witneſſe, ſideliſſimus ſibi teſtis: who ſhunning to reueale his owne praiſe, and yet ſeeking to make knowne the power of his Chriſt, wraps vp in modeſtie, &c.

               § 15. I omit your railing in your num. 18. where you ſay the Biſhop hath beene puzled with places, and faine to triſle, wrangle, cogge, and lye, &c. I account it my ill happe, to be matcht with ſuch a rakeſhame, that obſerues no reuerence, and is onely good at proouing our patience. Onely my comfort is, as Demoſthenes is ſaid, to haue ſaid in the like, that I ſhall ouercome in beeing put downe, and you looſe in conquering, in ſo damned an encounter. The Biſhop had ſaid of the Cardinalls teſtimonies, cited out of the fathers, vnum hoc peccant omnia. All the places brought for Peters primacie, trip in this, that they haue nothing, in truth, which may

not ſtraight be granted, except ſome petty word, about which I meane not to iangle. And what more excellent 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   could there be then this? a premunition, or an amulet, againſt the errors, that might ariſe in vnſtable minds, by miſtaking the fathers, while they vſe ſuch ſpeaches. For as Epiphanius ſaies, that ſuch cautions muſt be vſed ſometimes, euen towards the writings of holy Scripture, leaſt the Reader be peruerted, rather then edified; ſo, in the fathers much more, who neither write ſo plaine for vnderſtanding as the Scriptures, nor yet ſo currant for beleife. It followes in the Biſhop; Nam nec primatum negamus Petri &c. for wee deny not the primacy of Peter, nor the names which doe ſignifie it, but wee demand the thing, or the matter it ſelfe now in queſtion, to wit, his earthly Monarchy. Thus he. And to this what ſay you? You ſay, he grants the primacy of Peter, and yet labours to ouerthrow it, when it is prooued out of the fathers. As how, trow you? When they teach that Peter had the primacie, becauſe he was the foundation of the Church, and that he had a ſpeciall commiſſion giuen him to feede Chriſts ſheepe, he goeth about to prooue that Peter was no more the foundation of the Church, then the reſt of the Apoſtles were, nor otherwiſe Paſtor thereof, then they. And what of that? Wherein then conſiſted this primacy, which the fathers teach, and deduce, from the power giuen him by the keyes, and by his paſtorall commiſſion, which doe import authority, power, iuriſdiction, and gouernment? This you. It hath bin told you, Sir, ſufficiently, ouer and ouer, wherein the primacy of Peter conſiſted, though it draw no ſoueraignty or Iuriſdiction with it, and much leſſe ſo great, as you are in loue with, I meane the temporal and the terrible; quae & ſpiritum concutit ſaecularis rei gratiâ, as Tertullian ſaies, or ſaeculum concutit praetextu

And yet why ſhould we tell you, wherein

this primacie conſiſts, that the Fathers deduce out of the words of Scripture, rather then you conclude it out of the words themſelues, or the Fathers words vpon thoſe words, and ſo force it vpon our conſciences, that we may haue nothing to anſwer, but by yeelding to your deſire? Nowe you are faine to raue, and chaſe, and cry, after all is done, what is it, if it be not this? What is paſce oues, and ſuper hanc petram, but onely the making Peter cheife Magiſtrate of the Church, ſo as all Iuriſdiction may flow from him? Whereas we may ſay more truely, and aske of you, what ſo vnlikely foundation hath this exorbitant power, as either the keies of the Church, or the feeding of Chriſts ſheepe? And doth the Biſhop, good Sir, only goe about to prooue that other Apoſtles are ioyned with Peter, either in the feeding of Chriſts flocke, or in the receiuing of the keyes? Which hee hath euidently conuinced, and demonſtrated to your eye, both by the ſequele of the text, and the authorities of the Fathers. The Fathers argument then, (ſay you) is nothing worth, whereby they would eſtabliſh the primacie of Peter, from ſuch places. As though Peters primacy might not be prooued from The Papiſts deuice is ouerthrowne by themſelues; ſo farre are the Fathers from abetting it.

To our Sauiour, no doubt, all times were one. the places, and yet that primacie bee no ſuch primacie as you conceit. For the verie promiſing of the keyes, though with intention to them all, yet to him onely formally, & the feeding of Chriſts lambes, which was the charge of them all, yet three ſeuerall times enioyned to him, becauſe of his threefold deniall of his Lord, giues him a kind of prerogatiue or primacie, if you call it ſo, which we enuie him not, and yet ſtill falls ſhort of your Monſtrous Monarchie.

Neither pittie the fathers, as moſt idlely you would ſeeme to doe, in your 19. numb. for inferring the primacie from ſuch places as thoſe; but rather condemne your owne fooliſh fancie, for miſinterpreting ſo groſſely, both the Fathers and the places. When you ſay, The Biſhop is miſerably troubled with certaine petty words, with voculae quaedam, as Caput, and Primatus, and ſometimes hee graunts them, ſometimes denies them: What more iuſt, or more reaſonable courſe can bee held, then both to graunt them, and denie them, the one in the Fathers ſenſe, that they alledge them in; the other in yours, as you peruert them? As for troubling the Biſhop, they are ſo farre frō that, thoſe ſmall words, & as you ſay, petty voculae; that by his accurate explaining them, I verily beleeue, he hath prouided ſo well, as they ſhall neuer trouble any man more hereafter.

                  workers neither. Doe what is good, and he will praiſe thee not puniſh thee. The ruler is the Miniſter of God, for thy good, but if thou doe that which is euill, be afraid, for he is the Miniſter of God, a reuenger to execute wrath vpon all them, that doe euill. Yea, they are all Gods Miniſters, attending vpon this very thing continually. Doth not this rather ſhew, that the King is aſſiſted by God, then the Pope, to preſerue him as well from ſcandall of action, as from errour in iudgment? Though for the Pope, you are not wont to deny your ſelues, that he may erre in action, and that very fowly: all your care is to vphold the credite of his Iudgement, wherein you ſee the King enioyes Gods directions, no leſſe then hee. But why ſhould you bee ſo loath, to admit of the terme of temporall Monarchy, or earthly primacy?

May we not ſay with the Poet, as he doth of Dido?—hoc praetexit nomine culpā, cladem rather: or with the ſame author elſewhere,—Quid ſi quod voce negatis, Mente datis, or vendicatis? What is this, but to cut the throat with a woodē knife, pretending gentlenes to the acts of fiercenes, Iacobs voice, and Eſaus hands? Or like the Axe, in Aeſops fables, which Biſhop Fiſher tould of, that came a begging vpon a time to a certaine goodly wood, or tuft of trees, for a helue or a handle, promiſing to trim it, and prune it, and keepe it neat, but ended in felling, quelling, and deſtroying. So the Pope challengeth nothing, but a ſpirituall primacie, to keep Kings in order and in awe, who elſe would be extrauagant, he ſaies; which if once you graunt him, you ſhall ſee what feats of miſcheife he will worke you, as Balaam ſaid, I would kill the outright, if I had but a ſword, or as Numb 22.

               § 17. Why, but S. Peter exerciſed a corporall power, and S. Paul likewiſe, for ſo much as they both ended in corporall effects, as 
                  Adioyn Num. 22 
                  in ſtriking Elymas the ſorcerer blinde, as in puniſhing Ananias, and Sapphira, with bodily death. As if this were the power, either of Peter or Paul, beeing miraculous in them both; wheras Miracles come from no inhaerent power, as your School-men teach, from a circumſtant rather, or an attendant; almighty God, by meanes vnknowne, being ready to execute the determinations of his ſeruants. But wee ſpeake of a power inherent in the magiſtrate, which is denominated by the effects, as the effects are ſorted and qualified by their obiects, goods, bodies, limmes, and liberty. For about them are conuerſant the acts of magiſtracy, depriuations, impriſonments, maymes, or deathes. Which the doer of miracles hath no hand in the inflicting of, but at his requeſt Omnipotencie effecteth. Euen as you read of Ioſua commanding the ſunne, Obediuit Deus voci hominis, but voci onely, &c. S.

                  Ambr. confutes this argument of yours, lib. 3. Offic. cap. 14. ſpeaking of Elizeus & the Syrians whom he took priſoners, that, Non erant manu percutiendi, quos ſupernaturali virtute ſubiugâſſet. They might not be ſtricken with hand, whom God had extraordinarily put into his hands. So as S. Peter himſelf Expellit dictis, non armis, ſaies Lucret. lib. 5. might not exerciſe any bodily force vpon thoſe, whom the holy Ghoſt by miracle had ſubiected to him. Much leſſe then may we, by his example.
               § 18. Neither is it to be wondred, that the primitiue Church might haue temporall power, or corporall power in defect of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, to puniſh offendors, which ſince hath ceaſed in the ordinary gouernment, the Church hauing returned to her Channells, as I may ſay, and the Magiſtrate being at hand to take her part.

Auſten, de peccatorum meritis & remiſſ. lib. 1. cap. 14. And Origen to the ſame purpoſe, In Euang. Iohann. Tom. 32. 
                  Non eſt dictum, Qui credit in vos, credit in me; etſi dictum eſt, Qui recipit vos, recipit me. It is not ſaid, He that beleeueth in you, beleeueth in me, though it be ſaid, He that receiueth you receiueth mee. And the one of theſe, is for the Sermo, in Origens declaration of it, the other for them qui à ſermone, that is for the Apoſtles. The very ſame hath S. Auſten, almoſt totidem verbis, vpon the ſame place of S. Iohn, Tract. 44. that you may know one Father borrowed of another, ſpecially the Latine of the Greeke. Each of them ſhewing this, that the Saints though they are to be receiued by vs, yet not receiued by faith, but Chriſt onely, who is the word of his father.
                  
And againe Origen more pithily, Hom. 4. in Ezech. Ad eos qui in Sanctis fiduciam habent, non incongruè proferimus exemplum, Maledictus homo qui ſpem habet in homine. Againſt them that put their truſt in Saints, wee alleadge that Scripture not without good cauſe, Curſed is the man that makes man his truſt. And a little after, Si neceſſe eſt in aliquo ſperare, omnibus derelictis ſperemus in Domino. If wee muſt needes hope in ſome bodie, leauing all let vs hope in the Lord. Like thoſe godly Burgundions, whome Socrates reports of, lib. 7. hiſt. cap. 30. that weary of ſeeking ayde any more of man, they determined to commit themſelues henceforth wholy to God, and guided by the prouidence that neuer forſakes, choſe the Chriſtians God, who was then worſhipped throughout the Romane Empire; And their reaſon was, becauſe he was neuer knowne to faile any ſuch as truſted in him. A moſt true Elogium, and a worthy ground of comming to God, accedendi ad Deum, that I may ſpeake with the Apoſtle, Heb. 11. Which ſoone after was verefyed vpon them, by a moſt ioyfull experience; and a Biſhop of France (no neede of the Pope to ſuch worke, I wiſſe, whatſoeuer you dreame) baptiſed them, and incorporated them, after he had humbled them with faſting (a moſt worthie practiſe) ſeuen dayes together, & inſtructed them in the faith. But this by the way. Returne we to putting confidence in God onely. How often doth the Scripture particularly ſo appropriate it? Faith in God, Act. 20. Hebr. 6. Ierem. 17. Pſal. 117. Pſal. 146. &c. As who would ſay, It is the priuiledge wherein God and the creature communicate not, (like gloria mea not to be giuen to another, like Achilles

Yet nothing reſerued from Ioſeph by either of them, but onely the one his wife, and the other his crowne. So is faith in God, one of Gods peculiars. Yea S. Chryſoſtome obſerues, Hom. 3. in Act. that the Apoſtles durſt not

ſay when time was, Fides in eum, that is, in Chriſtum, but onely, fides per nomen eius, faith by his name. So tender a point this is. Which he repeates elſewhere. S. Cyrill alſo; of whom In fine huius. anone. In the meane while proceed.

Rom. 2. ſo there is a double inuocation, one of Saints, another of God. As if glory in the firſt place, bee not glory which we aſcribe to God, in the ſecond that which God vouchſafes to vs. Is inuocation ſo? Doth God inuocate? And why does our Sauiour conclude his prayer, the exemplary platforme of all praying, with Quia tua eſt gloria, &c. but that Saints haue no ſuch glory; and yet pray wee muſt not, but onely to them, to whome wee may aſcribe the like glory. As the cauſall particle in that prayer implyes, QVIA tuum eſt regnum, & potentia, & gloria, &c. FOR thine is the kingdome, the power, and the glory.

Let them be called by my name, or let it be their title and ſtyle to haue Abraham, and Iſaac, and Iacob, to their Fathers. For it is no ſmall prerogatiue, Quorum ſunt patres, Rom. 9. Did they giue commaundement to be inuocated as Gods, when they lay a dying (as he belike Iacob is made to Canonize himſelfe, yet aliue.

Seuen women ſhall ſay to one man, let thy name be called vpon vs; in the very ſame ſenſe: that is, let vs be reckoned and accounted thine. Salomon a little otherwiſe, in the dedication of his temple, deſires that Gods name may be called vpon it, yet not as if the temple ſhould pray to God, &c. But the rather did the Patriarch here deſire this, concerning Ephraim and Manaſſeh, leaſt the diſparity of their birth hauing an Egyptian to their mother, might quaile their confidence in Gods promiſes to their Fathers, and that they might know they had as good intereſt in them, as the reſt of their kindred.

Are not they Fathers, and multiplyed Fathers? Will his MAIESTIE refuſe the Councells, wherein ſo many ſpeake as one man, that is content to be ordered by the Fathers in ſingular, if the authority be pregnant, and the antiquity ſufficient? But how ſhamefully does he belye the Councell of Gangra? Neither is any ſuch thing in the Proeme there, nor yet in the Canons. Onely a corruption is crept into the Proeme, which is nothing materiall neither, though it were graunted. See the Greeke at Paris, of Tilius his edition, ſee other Greeke copies.

               § 12. Likewiſe once againe, I muſt tell you, to your num. 17. the Cardinals argument is moſt ridiculouſly miſerable, from veneration of relliques, to interceſſion of Saints. Quo ferrumine tandem iſta? What ſother hath he to make theſe hold? Though we deny relliques to haue been euer venerated in the primitiue Church with your manner of venerations. S. Auſten indeede ſayes, veneramur baptiſmum Epiſt. 145. and, Hortatio haec quae vbi

Auſten would haue Baptiſme and the word preached to bee had in worſhip of vs. Which the Papiſts making ſlight of, diuert their veneration now to the Sacrament of the Altar, as if none but that. S. Chryſoſtome hom. 8. in epiſt. ad Epheſ. Angeli venerantur

                         Pauli, which were too much for an Angel, to worſhip Paul himſelfe, much more his chaines. But, Eſtimation with

                  S. Auſten. So happily relliques. They were venerabiliter habitae, reſpectfully kept, or regardfully preſerued, not worſhipped, nor adored. You may read S. Gregory about this point, Epiſt. ad Conſtant. Auguſt. where he miſlikes the taking vp of dead bodies, to make relliques of them; the worſhipping much more. They neither ſought the liuing among the dead, which the Angell condemnes, nor à viuentibus ad mortuos, which Eſay forbids, and hee purged as you know by an Angell, and a coale. But what neede wee more words, when your ſelfe ſay, that Cap. 10. Numb. 19. of the Adioynd. 
                  the Biſhop graunts as much as you deſire in this point? Doe then as he.

when he drawes ſuch conſequences, from the vertue of Martyrs, to the veneration of their relliques. Are not relliques ſubiect to diuers caſualties? to warres, to fires, to conſumption, &c. And ſhall they keepe Countries, that not themſelues? S. Chryſoſt. in Lazarum, ſaies, that the very houſes wherein Bibles are, are the more defenced againſt Deuills and ſundry calamities. Yet the Bible is not worſhipped, by you eſpecially. But for their loue to the Bibles, God doth this. So for them that honour his Saints without idolatry.
               § 14. To Numb. 29. Mamas was but vocatus, not inuocatus, nor aduocatus neither, as you tranſlate it.

Or, as if we ſhould ſay, Daniels God, not inuoking Daniel; ſo Mamas his god; wee name his name, but wee doe not inuocate him as our patrone. Onely we ſhew we conſent in religion with him, and in our ioynt ſeruice to the common Lord. As he that commaunded all men to worſhip Daniels God. Dan. 6. 26. Does S. Baſil ſay that Mamas euer helpt him? I warrant you not. What then does he els, but euen take aduantage of the honeſt peoples affection, towards the deceaſed champion, to eſtabliſh them in the zeale of the true God, whome he ſerued and ſuffered for? In this ſenſe it may be true, what you ſay out of Theodoret, cap. 8. num. 45. That, prayer to Saints (ſuch praier as I haue 
                     Deus Chriſtianorum, often in the Church. hiſtorians. Does that inferre praying to Chriſtians

                      or not rather to the God of Chriſtians only? now deſcribed) confirmes Chriſts Diuinity. Which els it diſables rather, but ſurely diſhonours. And ſo I anſwer to your 22. and 23. numb. of this Chap. that by this meanes they might know the ſame God to haue holpen them, whoſe Martyr Mamas was, though they made no petitions to the Martyr himſelfe.
               § 15. The defence of your tranſlation of S. Baſils text, againſt ſo cleare a light as is the originall greeke, is more then impudent. Therefore I paſſe by that, and come to Euſebius, the Cardinalls next author, in your Numb. 29. De praep. Euan. l. 13. cap. 7.
               
               § 16. Though that alſo about Euſebius, is of the ſame

                     ting the Greeke text, becauſe the words in the Greeke are ſomewhat otherwiſe, making no expreſſe mention of praying to Martyrs, but onely at their tombes. Whereto I anſwer, that the Latine tranſlator followed the ſenſe of Euſebius, gathering the ſame out of the circumſtance of the place. For Euſebius ſhewing the conformitie of Platoes doctrine to our Chriſtian relligion, &c: Numb. 29. A dioynd.
                   
                  tandem? You defend Chriſtophorſons falſe gloſſe againſt Euſebius his originall greeke text. Whom ſhal we beleeue in this caſe? Neither ſay, it is gathered out of the circumſtances of the text. His MAIESTIE lookes for Fathers, in ſuo puro & natiuo, without your daſhings, or interlacings. Nay verily it is an argument, that no ſuch ſeruice of Saints was euer vſed in the primitiue Church, becauſe Euſebius here hath no ſuch words. Who els would haue beene forward, you may be, ſure to haue paralleled herein the Chriſtian faſhion with Platoes deuices. But he mentions not praying to them in the leaſt word; the Tranſlator onely. Therefore as I ſaid.
               § 17. You plead, that the Cardinall is guiltles of this fraud, and deales vprightly, though the Tranſlator lead him aſide into error. It is hard to beleeue you, when the Greek was at his hand. But in the meane time, you ſee his proofes are anſwered, which is all we ſtand vpon.

                  , which is to touch, that it ſhould ſignifie to worſhip, as you beare vs in hand, who beleeues it? Yet it is maruaile you inferre not faith in relliques, becauſe S. Chryſoſtome ſayes, Let vs imbrace them, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , with faith. Which rather, I ſhould thinke, checks your vſe of relliques, as now adayes they are vſed, and lifts vp the mind à mortuis ad viuentem, or à ſpolijs mortuorum, from ſhirts and hand-kercheffs, to the liuing God.
               § 19. You quote Plutarch, Othone,

                  . Some thinke it ſhould bee

                     . per modum ſupplicationis tetigere manus. But in Plut. Otho I find neither, and both come to one ende. If your quotation be right (for I promiſe you I cannot find it) it prooues not, that touching is worſhipping, with Plutarch, but that hands ſupplicate, or make requeſt, which they performed then, of whome Plutarch ſpeaks, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , viz.

                  , aggreſſi ſunt, they ſet forward to ſupplicate and make prayer by hands, as I conſtrue it. Elſe I knowe not what the meaning of your quotation is, and whence you had it, ſee you. You quote Criſpinus his Dictionary, cō
                  piled out of another of Budaeus his, as you imply. But in Criſpins Dictionary of 1595. which is ſaid to bee recèns reſtitutum & auctum, I finde not one word ſounding that way. Therefore I thinke it is not in Budaeus neither, yet hee reckons vp many ſignifications (I meane Criſpine doth) as capeſſere Rempublicam, laedere', haerere & conglutinari, guſtare, comedere, perſtringere etiam & taxare. Maruaile, how hee ſhould leaue out onely this, if any ſuch were. Sure you neuer turned the booke, but either beleeued your Monitors, or thought it was ſo, becauſe you wiſhed and ſtrongly imagined it to be ſo indeed. Heſychius, and Suidas, are as dumb the ſame way about the ſenſe of the word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Stephen and Scapula, who both quote Budaeus for the ſenſes of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , yet haue none ſuch neither. In the end of Plutarchs Otho, I finde onely this, ſpeaking of the loue which the ſouldiers bare to Otho euen dead, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, ſome touched his hands, Which, I

pray you, may not a man doe towards a dead bodie, for the loue he bore to the perſon in his life time, vnles hee worſhippe it? Remember the ſtory of Artemiſia and Mauſolus. That was more then touching, when ſhee eate and dranke the aſhes of her dead husband, for very loue. Some kiſſed (ſaies Plutarch) the wound of the dead bodie, ſome touched his hands, ſome made obeyſance a farre off. What is this to the matter? And one of the Dictionariſts aforenamed, quotes the place of the Goſpel, of many that touched the hemme of our Sauiours garment. Yet of worſhipping it, not a word. I ſhould thinke that were a fine place to ground worſhipping of relliques vpon, (if touching be worſhipping) our Sauiour beeing as ſacred and ſoueraigne in his life time, as any Saint is after his death. But the ſtory of his interring by Ioſeph and Nicodemus, (where there is no mention to Mark. 15. 46. this purpoſe) conſutes relliques more then this can poſſibly helpe them.

Is it not one thing what touching ſimply ſignifies, another what touching with ſuch particular circumſtance, as the beard, the knee, the hand? &c. Our Sauiour himſelfe touched the leper, and cured him, Mat. 8. 3. And, Mar. 10. 13. for the like cauſe they brought young children to him,

Chryſoſtom does not bid vs touch our hands, or kiſſe our hands, at the ſight of the Relliques, but touch them. Let Chryſoſtome expound himſelfe in another place. In his Comment. vpon 2. Cor. the laſt chapter, Hom. 30. he mentions not onely touching, but kiſſing one another (and that expreſſely in oſculo ſancto, with the holy kiſſe, or the relligious kiſſe;) yea he ſaies, they kiſſed the Church ſo, and the Church-porch ſo. Which, I ſuppoſe, your ſelues would not admit, that we ſhould worſhip one another, or worſhip the Church, and much leſſe the Church-porch, with relligious adoration. Therefore touching is no adoring; no nor 
                     Touching & kiſſing of holy things, is from a reuerent aſſection, not a relligious adoration. kiſſing neither, which is a touching in ſpecie, as your Martiall, no doubt, hath told you long ere this time. And now to Mr. Marſhall therefore.

What is this to worſhipping, and not rather to ſaluting, but that with you, to ſalute the Virgine, is to pray to her? We

worſhip the God, whom we confeſſe we cannot touch. But, Otho protendens manum, adorauit vulgum, in Tacitus. By that reaſon, S. Paul adored the aſſembly when he ſtretched out his hand, ſpeaking to them, Act. 26. 2. Which Athanaſius ſayes of himſelfe, that he does too, as much as he may in abſence, to the Emperour Conſtantius. See Apolog. ad Conſtant. in the beginning. Did he worſhip him in ſo doing, trowe you? or rather make audience? Neither did Otho touch the people whome he worſhipt, and yet you bring this, to prooue, that touching is worſhipping. Venerantes Deum tangimus frontem, ſaies Seruius; but noſtram, not deorum.

Belike, the dead bodie worſhipt Elizeus, whome it touched; for that you muſt ſay, or els you ſay nothing. We will ſoone grant, that God may diſpence bleſſings by dead bones, but not to the worſhippers, no not of the liuing Prophets, but of God onely. Him worſhip, Apoc. 19. and 22. Yea, S. Ambroſe would not ſay, Tactu ipſo medicabiles eſſe relliquias, if Tactus ipſe were adoration. For why ſhould he extenuate adoration ſo? I touch a wholeſome hearbe, and it abates anguiſh; I worſhippe it not. Nay, the woman that found health by touching our Sauiours hemme of his garment, though he was the proper obiect of worſhip, which Saints are not, yet her touching was no ſymbolum of her adoration of him, albeit by Gods bleſſing a meanes of health to her. Therefore we denie your concluſion, numb. 42. that touching includes veneration of the thing touched. Yea, ſometime

the healer touched the party grieued, (whom he worſhipped not you may be ſure) as 2. Kin. 5. 11. Naaman lookt for it. But in the 4. of the ſame booke, v. 34.

In Engliſh thus, for the ſatisfaction of euery Reader, your ſelfe and all, good Mr. F. T. To thee, and but to thee to none, I make my prayer. The Biſhop cited them out of a manuſcript which hee keepeth yet to be ſeene, vpon any occaſion, called the Diuruall of the Maronites, a certaine kinde of Monks, in a Monaſtery on Mount Sinah. Which booke was printed at Rome, anno 1584. at the commaundement of Gregory 13. by Dominicus Baſa in Syriaque characters, though it be the Arabique
                  
tongue, vnder the name of the prayer of S. Ephrem. The words alſo before and after, are theſe; Accipe deprecationem meam ô Domine, non propter iuſtitiam meam, ſed propter miſericordiam tuam, & in multitudine benignitatum tuarum, & miſerationum tuarum, ſalua animam meam, quae captiuata eſt à morte. Memor eſto mei ô Domine, & etiamſi peccaui & vulneratus ſim vulneribus laethalibus, tamen NON PRECOR QVENQVAM PRAETERTE. Sed ad miſericordiam tuam & bonitatem me recipio, quoniam tu es ille Dominus Deus omnia cōprehendens, & poteſtas tua ſuper omne vitam trahens, &c. That is; Receiue my prayer O Lord, not for my righteouſnes, but for thy mercyes ſake, and in the multitude of thy bountyes and of thy compaſſions, ſaue my ſoule which is taken priſoner of death. Remember mee O Lord, and although I haue ſinned, and am wounded with deadly wounds, YET DOE I NOT PRAY TO ANY BESIDES THY SELFE. Looke you; The Papiſts would haue them that are oppreſſed with the conſcience of grieuous ſinnes, fly to the Saints as fitteſt to deale with, or to deale by, for deſperate offendors; they beeing too vnworthy to appeare immediately before God. Yet S. Ephrem ſaith, that although hee haue ſinned, and be deadly wounded, yet to God, and to God onely, doth he commend himſelfe by prayer. It followes. But to thy mercy and bounty doe I betake my ſelfe, becauſe thou art that Lord God, which compriſeſt all things, (or embraceſt all things) no doubt the moſt recreant ſinners of all) and thy power is ouer all that liueth and breatheth, &c. Beſides this, which yet is pregnant enough to iuſtify the Biſhop from beeing ſuch a falſary, as this man would make him, (who may rather feare the imputation of it himſelfe, as if his two letters were as many marks in his forehead to know a Falſe Theefe by) beſides this I ſay, though S. Ephrem (as he is now printed) haue not theſe words verbatim, yet in all the procationes and orationes of his (which of purpoſe haue been peruſed and read ouer for this ende) in the firſt Tome (for if any of it bee Ephrems, that is; as for the reſt, the Biſhop will avouch it,

that they are no more Ephrems workes, then his owne) there is neuer any the leaſt mention of praying to any Saint. And ſo much alſo of Ephrem and his authority bee ſpoken.

abſurdly you prate numb. 55. that prayer to Saints is a neceſſary duty, and may not be ſpared, nor bated vs at any hand, becauſe the Catholicke Church hath practiſed it. Does not this bewray your beggarly proofes for prayer to Saints, together with your baſe conceit of the articles of faith, and things neceſſary to ſaluation? I remember Bonauenture (and hee not the worſt of your ſchoole-men) In 4. ſenten. Diſt. 45. art. 3. quaeſt. 3. hauing alleadged many reaſons againſt prayer to Saints, and ſurely not to be deſpiſed, howſoeuer hee thought of them, determines thus in the ende, as in very good earneſt, that thoſe reaſons are no reaſons, becauſe facit hoc communiter eccleſia, & conſtat quòd non errat, &c. that is his laſt reſolution.

Chryſoſtome, certaine words next following, wherein there is not one dram of matter to your purpoſe, though they were ſqueezed to the proofe. Howbeit I make haſt, yet I will ſet them downe. Thus he ſayes. Therefore dareſt thou be ſo bold to ſay, that their Lord or Maſter is dead, whoſe ſeruants euen when they are dead, are

Then hee goes forward. And this is not onely ſeen at Rome, but alſo at Conſtantinople. For euen here the ſonne of Conſtantine the great, thought his Father to be much honoured, if his bodie were layd before the gates of the Fiſherman. Thus Chryſoſtome. And what is this to the matter?

Themſelues forbid themſelues to be worſhipped, Reuel. 18. and here they are faine to be commaunded to it, afore they can be brought to worſhip a Man. Yet what man? Adoratur, quidem vt vnigenitus, et ſi vocetur primogenitus, id quod manifeſtiſſimae humanitatis menſuras maximè decet. As the firſt begotten he worſhips, as the onely begotten he is worſhipped. For he conſiſts, ex natur a adorabili, & adorante, ſaies the ſame Cyrill there. According as his owne words are, Ioh. 4. Nos adoramus quod ſcimus. Yet playner. Num igitur tanquam hominem adoramus Immanuelem? Abſit. Deliramentum enim hoc eſſet, & deceptio, ac error. That is. Do we therefore worſhip the Immanuel as a man? God forbid. For that were to doate, to erre, and to be deceiued. And, In hoc enim nihil differremus ab his qui creaturam colunt vltrá conditorem. That is, For in ſo doing we ſhould, differ nothing from them that worſhip the creature aboue the Creator. Not that any worſhipt the creature more then the creator, (who ſo madde?) but euery iuxtà is vltrà with S. Paul, when any thing comes to be worſhipped beſides God, Rom. 1. Many the like clauſes are in that booke, but with this I will ende, to ſhew Cyrills iudgement of faith in Saints, which was the thing that wee beganne with. Alioqui quemodè in illum credamus?

Would the Church at that time allow faith in Saints thinke you? Ergò neceſſariò ad periculum & metum illum tollendum, ſidem referebat in Deitatis naturam (Chriſtus viz,) & quidem in perſona patris, & non noſtra humilitate, dicebat, Qui credit in me, non credit in me, ſed in eum qui miſit me. That is. Therefore of neceſſity to preuent that feare, and that daunger, (Chriſt) reduced our faith in him vnto the nature of his Godhead, and ſaid in the perſon of his father, and not in our [natures] meanneſſe, He that beleeueth in mee, beleeueth not in mee, but in him that ſent mee. This agrees with S. Chryſoſtome, who, as I told you before, obſerues that the Apoſtle durſt not ſo much as name ſidem in Chriſtum, faith in Chriſt, a good while after his reſurrection, till the world was better ſeaſoned with the beleefe of his Godhead. But hereof ſo much.

How thinke you? or if this like you not, you may do well next time to ſet downe Maximus his owne words in Latine, and ſparing yours, to leaue the Reader to his owne interpretation of them, vnleſſe you could better. And why I pray you does Maximus pray onely to Agnes among ſo many Saints, as he Panegyrizeth in thoſe Orations, both men and women? Or how did he ſay a little before, Veni iam Virgo ad Thalamum, &c.

                   Firſt, that the doubt of ſome mens eſtates, as not deliuered from Purgatorie, nor hauing payd their laſt farthing (though Tertullian call inferos nouiſſimi quadrantis exactores, hell (not Purgatory)

But to which ſide ſoeuer of the two you encline, they both conſute the Adioynders fiction here, that the Fathers would pray more confidently to Saints departed, but for feare of purgatorie.
                   they pray to them? were they not afraid of that, Thou which heareſt others, help thy
                  
                  ſelfe? Or if they pray vnto them, afore they are certified of their eſtate, either they are raſh in praying (for there muſt be no wauering Iames 1. 6.) or elſe it appeares they dreamt not of Purgatory. Would you haue them to mammer, as Elias ſaid merrily once of Baal, Perhaps he is gone to warre, or perhaps in his iourney, ſo perhaps he is gone to Purgatory?

               § 3. Another, that when Nazianzen ſaies to Conſtantius, and ſo others to others, If thou heareſt, or if thou diſcerneſt, it is not of doubting, but of adiuration, as when a friend to a friend, If you loue me: and S. Paul to Philemon, If thou account me as thy partner: that is, becauſe I know thou accounteſt me. That Nazianzenes meaning may be this, Becauſe ô Conſtantius I know thou diſcerneſt, &c. Which I liſt not to refute, but referre to the Readers indifferent iudgement, whether Nazianzen in beſpeaking Conſtantius ſo, ſhould meane to adiure him, and all other ſoules of Chriſtian Kings, whom there he calls vnto, no leſſe then his. The Greeke Scholiaſt ſaies plainly, vpon that place, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , this is taken from Iſocrates, who perhaps held not that the Saints ſee all cleerly afore the day of iudgement. And he conſtrues it in other words 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   (for he was abſent) If thou haſt any 
                        〈◊〉
                      to diſcerne and heare things here done. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Now, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , is no forme of adiuration, but of doubting ſtill. Elſe it ſhould be 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , like S. Pauls
                  
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . And by the way, you may ſee how true it is, that the Biſhop obſerues, of the Fathers falling into Rhetoricall acclamations, whereof this was one, taken from Iſocrates, a Mr. in that faculty. But more cleerely of Gorgonia, Si Sancta animae haec talia perſentiſcant. If the holy ſoules vnderſtand ſuch things as theſe. This is no adiuring of Gorgonia, I trowe, but his doubt in generall, euen of them he ſpoke not to, but onely of.
               § 4.  A third is, That it is dangerous to ſay the Fathers carried themſelues like Orators. Not a whit I warrant you, though it be your ſhame to miſtake them ſo groſſely, as from thence to patch vp your damnable idolatryes. So wings, and armes, and eyes, and other members are attributed to God in holy Scripture. A ſtumbling blocke to the Anthropomorphites, or ſuch ſhallow wits, but no fault of the holy Ghoſtes, qui ſcribit vigilantibus, as lawes are made. Wee imagine not, ſaies S. Auſten, our God to be a Cupid, becauſe he is deſcribed to haue wings and arrowes, lib. 3. contra Creſcon. c. 78. You heard before, what Nazianzenes commentor ſayes, of his borrowing from Iſocrates. Though the Biſhop ſayes no where in plaine tearmes, that the Fathers did as Orators, not as Chriſtians. But, Theologiamne docore, an rhetoricari putes? Would you thinke theſe men meant to read a lecture of Diuinitie, or to practiſe their Rhetorique? And, Oratorum encomia, quae nihil habent enucleatae Theologiae: Orators prayſes, which containe no perfect ſubſtance of Diuinitie: ſuppoſe you, like that which your Schoolemen deliuer. So Hierome (ſaies the Biſhop) ſpeaks with Paula and Nepotian: how? With both as an Orator, with neither as a Chriſtian, that is, according to the rules of ſtrict catechiſme. What of this?
               § 5. Your fourth obſeruation in the 8. numb. is petitio principij, and the turning of the wheele. Therefore I will not meddle with it. Let the Biſhops anſwer be but applyed to your obiection, and it will ſalue it as before.

And I might ſeeme to doe the like, if I ſhould be ſo madde as to follow you. Onely thus in briefe. S. Chryſoſtome of them that would haue pictures of the Seraphim,

Non te defodis? Art thou not aſhamed, O thou wretch, (ſayes he) of ſuch a groſſe collection? Why doeſt thou not rather runne vnder ground, burie thy ſelfe aliue? And he addes in the ſame place, that the Seraphim are ſaid to couer their faces with wings at the appearance of God, onely to ſhewe that God is incomprehenſible. Yet you paint them for their wings, whereas their wings are giuen them by the holy Ghoſt, ſayes Chryſoſtome, to ſhew the ſecreſie, and that it muſt not be painted, which cannot ſo much as be comprehended. I ſay nothing of the forbidding of the Lambe to be painted, in the Councel of Conſtantinople, which Mald. your fellow Ieſuite in his Comment vpon Daniel anſwers thus. That the Fathers in that Councell were not rightly inſtructed, and the Church ſawe more vpon better conſideration in after times. Yet you make vs beleeue that you reuerence the Fathers, and we cenſure them. As for the fruit you talke of to come by pictures, it is one thing, I ſhould think, what conſtant and ſtaied minds may gather therefrom; another whether

Auſten lib. 5. contra Iulian. c. 2. when Iulian had ſaid, that he borrowed his arguments from the pictures of Adam and Eue, repels that ſlaunder with this peremptorie deniall, that, Non à pictore inanium ſigurarum, ſed à doctore diuinarum literarum; ſhewing vs what we ſhould truſt to. And yet both Aquine and Bellarm argue from pictures in the queſtion of Peters primacie, and againe ſarre worſe about the dolours of Chriſts ſoule. If it were ſo (ſayes Bellar.) we ſhould haue ſeen him painted in Churches tormented by the Deuils, &c. De anima Chriſti. l. 4. c. 8. Is not this a graue handling of controuerſies, trow you, eſpecially with them that find fault with our lightnes? 
                  Sic errare meruerunt qui Chriſtum non in codicibus, ſed in pictis parietibus quaeſiuerunt.

Is this againſt S. Ambroſe? or the Cardinall rather? Whome Ambroſe his ſpeech, not ſo warie as to be wiſht perhaps, yet excuſable by his beeing a nouice, as then for certaine he was, might trip as it does, and hath done but euen too often. What virulencie, good Sir, is this againſt S. Ambroſe? Though if neede were, as there is none, and yet if there were, I were not worthie, beeing more nouice to the moſt worthie Biſhop, then euer S. Ambroſe was to himſelfe, yet I ſay, if occaſion ſo required, to ſhew what my conceit was once hereof at a bluſh, and a little to choake you the more about the place that you ſo ruffle in, how if graunting it in rigore, that To ſeeke to Angels, may be conſtrued, to reſort to the Miniſters for helpe, who are our Angels.

Ambroſe ſpeakes) not onely Angels; while that which is ſaid of martyrs may be vnderſtood per Proteroſin, of them that are not yet martyred, but onely appointed to the blocke: whome we haue more then pignore corporis with vs, and yet that too. True praeſules, true ſpeculatores, as S. Ambroſe calls them.
               § 10. Yet loe you will prooue, though cleane beſides our ſcope, beſides your owne, (but that, as they ſay, a beggar is neuer out of his way) that we may ſatisfie for our ſinnes. And you lay your ground, numb. 18. that Chriſts paſſion giues life to all. That's the blindation. But as well wood and clay, or other baſe ingredients in Nabuchodonoſors image, with ſounder mettals, eagles feathers, and other birds, may be

mixed and compounded, yea the iarring aſhes of the two Thebane brethren reconciled, as our wretched works and ſorry ſufferings with our Sauiours righteouſneſſe, which is

                  righteouſneſſe it ſelfe. Doe you not conceaue how one is incompatible with the other, almoſt crying out with S. Peter, Depart Lord, for I am a ſinnefull man, ſo, depart Lord, for I am a ſinnefull worke; while you boldly blend, and play the Vinteners, mingling guilty blood, with the blood of his ſacrifice, innocent and immaculate, moſt prepoſterous Pilates?
               
               § 11. Nazianzen is quoted Orat. 1. in Iulian. vt ſatisfacerent Chriſto ſanguine ſuo. In Nazianz. it is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which may as well be the iuſtifying of Chriſts cauſe by the effuſion of their blood, hauing newly diſhonoured it by ſtooping to the Emperours poiſonous baits, as to ſatisfie for their fault to the iudge of the world; which no man can doe, though in ſhadow and proportion one may come nearer perhaps then another: As he that ſpares not his life in his Lords cauſe, after he hath offended him, before him that languiſhes ſtill, and playes the lazy Chriſtian. So Nazianzen might meane, I ſee no cauſe to the contrary. Does not S. Peter take the word ſo?

In ſo much as you haue not ſpared Dan. 4. Peccatum tuum eleemoſynis redime. Which in Hebrew is abrumpe, as hath been often anſwered you, and ſo in other places. Yea, we are ſaued by hope, and he hath ſaued vs, by the lauer of regeneration, comes in to ſhew, that a man may waſh away his owne ſinnes, either with teares, or with blood. Is this good handling of Scriptures, trow you? If we are ſaued by hope, is it by hope in our ſelues, or our owne arme? If baptiſme purges vs, and the Sacrament of our Lord, ſhall there be the ſame vertue in our corrupt ſelues, who but for grace ſhould rather ſtaine

               § 12. To S. Ambroſes place in 1. ad Rom. Ad deum non eſt opus ſuffragatore, that is, To god wee neede no ſpokes-man: He ſayes, S. Ambroſe ſpeakes againſt them onely, that were deuoted to the Sunne, and Moone, and the Planets. But did euer any man make them his ſuffragators or ſpokes-men to god? And if as numb. 18. you ſuggeſt to vs, it was the Paynims fault to hold that God gouerned the world by vnder officers, what is yours leſſe, that apply that ſo, indeauouring to make way to inuocation of Saints, Take thou power ouer fiue cityes, thou ouer ten, &c? Shall Paynims faults be onely taxed in Coſter. Enchirid. Paynims, and not in them that reuiue the errors of Paynims, which they call Catholique? You wiſh the Biſhop to marke thoſe words, Ad deum promerendum in S. Ambroſes mouth, and ſo in other Fathers, nothing to your merit god wot. Multanos à deo bona meruiſſe cognouimus quibus nequaquam digni fuimus, ſaies Theodoſius the Emperour (among Felix culps quae talem MERVIT redemptorem. the lawes I trow it is) and many the like.

               § 13. You ſay, no ſacrifice might be offered but to God. And is not prayer a ſacrifice?

                  Tertullian ſaies. And what ſalt is in ſacrifice, without prayer? Yet ſale ſalietur, you know the place. Euery ſacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt; which you applie to purgatorie, wiſely no doubt. You ſay, that to God all hearts are manifeſt, and he needes no relator. Indeede becauſe he onely is

And I ſee not but it may be verified, euen in this ſenſe

too. To whome of the Saints then dare you pray thus, either as they in the Acts, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Ambroſe may ſeeme to take away our Sauiour Chriſts mediation and all, if he be not limited by your interpretation. Read but the Fathers, Primaſius, Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, and Theophylact, vpon Rom. 8. 34. Interpellat pro nobis. You ſhall finde, his interceſſion ſtands, in offering vp the memorie of his death and paſſion to his father, for vs. As a ſoldier which ſhewes his skars to his Prince, though he ſay nothing, yet he begs fauour. Which makes our prayers at the Euchariſt, ſo much the more effectuall, becauſe therein we renew the memorie of his death and blood-ſhed ſo liuely. According as himſelfe ſaid at the inſtitution, who beſt knew the vertue of his owne Sacrament, Doe this as oft as you ſhall doe it, in remembrance of me. Our

Chryſoſtome alſo ſaying to this purpoſe, that the time of praying is while the King is ſet,. i. during the communion, and ſo long he graunts any thing. minds therefore beeing poſſeſſed with the remembrance of that his death, wholly taken vp with that recogitation, our prayers haue ſo much the more eaſie ſpeeding towards the throne of grace, to whome that giues force. And can the Saints doe ſo of theirs? Which of them all was crucified for you? 1. Cor. 1. 13. yet you compare their interceſſion, with Chriſts for vs. Of whome ſome died not at all, moſt of them not violently, but none at all to make atonement to God, for vs. And becauſe I haue vouched the Fathers expoſition vpon Rom. 8. to be as I ſaid, I will ſet downe their authorities in no other words then their owne. Theophylact ſaies, Intuens nam

This ſenſe renders Theophylact of interpellat pro nobis. The like hath S. Hierome, Comm. huius loci. Interpellare pro nobis dicitur [Chriſtus] dum hominem quem ſuſcepit, patri pro nobis pignus oſtendit & offert. The very words

of S. Hierome, hath Primaſius in his commentarie, and Sedulius in his. Remigius hath the ſenſe in ſomewhat otherwords. Interpellat pro nobis patrem, ſaith he, non voce ſedmiſeratione; dum quotidie hominem quem aſſumpſit, & grauiſſimum genus mortis quod pro nobis ſuſtinuit, vultui paterno offert, vt nostri miſereatur. Haymoes words, in his commentarie, are the very ſame with Remigius his, now ſet downe.

Whereas the Papiſts thinke, that ſome may be buried vnder ſo deepe oppreſſions for the conſcience of their ſinnes, as they may not preſume to come immediatly to Chriſt, [whoſe interceſſion, ſaies Euthymius, is ſemper eſſicax, alwaies effectuall for vs: in comm. huius loci] but they muſt runne circuiting and fetching a compaſſe about by the Saints. Of what iudgement Chryſoſtome and Theodoret are, may be ſeene by Theophylact before alleadged, who ſieldome diſſent either for opinion or words. Of Lyra, and of Aquine, the like might be promiſed. But Sylveſter in Summâ ſhall determine all, though he expreſſely quote Aquine, Part. 2. V. Oratio, § ſecundo: Filius orat patrem (ſaies he) oſtendendo patri humanitatem cum myſterijs eius, vt dicit S. Tho. Rom. 8. Let this ſuſfice for this matter.
               § 14. Neither does S. Ambroſe ſay, Declaratore non opus eſt; but, ſuffragatore non opus eſt. You peruert him therefore when you ſay, he meant no more then ſo, that the Angels and Saints neede not informe God.
               
               § 15. I will conclude with that, that S. Ambroſe forbidding to adore our fellow-ſeruants (for prayer and adoration goe together with him, as I told you of S. Cyrill euen now the ſaine) ſaies, we can reſerue nothing more to God. But you haue found out certaine diſtinctions and kinds of it, which the Saints may partake, without Gods iniutie.

(ſay you) might rogare the people to pray for another Theodoſius. Is this comparable with our rogare Deū, with our making requeſts to God? Is God & the people ſued vnto alike? Why then do you ioyne ſuch vnſutable matches, whē you pretēd earneſt? But hircum qui mulgent, & vulpes iungant. As for your ſweet diſtinction, and ſubtill one no doubt, that only Another ſhift of the Adioynd.
                   God is to be ſued vnto for grace, but Saints for other things, and that this is the reaſon, why S. Ambroſe ſaid, that God indeede onely was to be requeſted, to giue a ſupply of more Theodoſij, which without his grace could not be Conſuted three wayes. 1 done, I might aske you, firſt, what one thing wee haue by vertue of prayer, which may not be tearmed grace? I meane as deſcending of free gift, and bounty.

                     . Neocaeſar. Can. 4. ſhould be hindred of his purpoſe [howſoeuer,] we were to knowe that ſuch a one was deliuered by grace. Therefore if grace come from God, not from the Saint, from God not from the Saint muſt come all that we ſtand in neede of. And ſo prayer be made, not to the Saint, but to God onely.  But ſecondly, Saints may repreſentare Theodoſios, ſupply good men as faſt as they decay, if not by their owne ſtrength &  inherent vertue, which reacheth neither to grace I confeſſe, nor to one crum of bread, yet by their potency with God, and by procuring his ayde through their mediation, if at leaſt your doctrine be true on this part. And therefore the qualification that you vſe towards S. Ambroſe, about Tu ſolus inriocandus, or rogandus either, is moſt ridiculous and childiſh. For euen the Saints power, may ſtretch to Grace at

ſecond hand, as you imagine.  To omit, that, tu ſolus rogandus es vt Theodoſios repraeſentes, is particularly determined,  and if you will to grace, becauſe without that a Theodoſius could not bee: but, Tu ſolus inuocandus es, is as generall as any thing, euen as the obiects of praier themſelues in their largeſt extention; and therefore this laſt muſt not be limited by the former, howſoeuer conſtrued, but all inuocation is to bee confined to God by the iudgement of S. Ambroſe, ſaying, Tu ſolus inuocandus es; ſcilicet ad omnia, or, in quacun

               § 17. The moſt Reuerend Biſhop neuer ſaid of himſelfe, Adioynd. num. 34. that he could not ſlip in matter of memory. Si ſciens fallo, is his imprecation. So Ieremy for Zachary, Matth. 27. 9. ſo diuerſe like. For what ſhould I ſay of the Fathers quoting Scripture, as they doe often, rather as it was in their memories, then as we read it in the text? And yet no honeſt learned man, but would hold ſuch ſcapes for very veniall I imagine. S. Auſten a little before was found to haue reported S. Cyprian ſomewhat wrongly, citing words out of his Cap. 3. hulus. booke de vnitate Eccleſiae. Sunt quidam eruditi errores & obliuiones, ſaies Rodolphus Agricola, Certaine learned errors or obliuious confuſions euen in the beſt authors. And Turrian ſaies of Cicero, Praefat. in Conſtitut. Clementis, that he was minè immemoris ingenij: very forgetfull touching quotations. Though there are more in this kind to be obſerued in Tully, then euer Turrian tooke note of I beleeue, as hypercriticall as he was. And thinke you not that we may with better reaſon avow, if we had not rather be ingenuous, then obſtinately contentious, as you are in defending your groſſe errors when they are eſpyed, that S. Ambroſe wrot not only one booke, but euen many de Oratione, then you can avow the Cardinalls allegations, either by the circumſtance of the text when the letter fayles you, or by the Italian preſſes of the Iuntae or the Seſſae? Call to minde a little, if you thinke good, De interpellatione three books, De interpellatione Dauid one booke, that is, all of them in effect de Oratione.
                  
Againe in his bookes de Sacramentis, alſo vpon the Lords prayer &c. All theſe wrote S. Ambroſe in effect of prayer, I

                      2. de Orat. dom. Chryſoſt hom. 3. in Gen. Damaſe. l. 3. de ſide Orthod. c. 24. And Clichtoueus in his Cōment. vpon Damaſ. calls it completam definitionem orationis, a perfect de ſinition of prayer. Sylveſter, Nauarrus, diuers other Papiſts retaine the ſame. ſay, or de Oratione, as the Biſhop calld it, and mentions not any where praying to Saints. Is this now of no force with you? And finally, ſo many Fathers haue defined prayer by our reference to God onely, (as indeede the Pater noſter does, which I muſt alwayes tell you of) that neither ſhall you be euer able to claw of that argument, neither if we now and then name one of them for another, ought you ſo much to blame vs for defect of memory, as forcibly ſubſcribe to ſo great varietie of conſent, as is able to confound the beſt memory.
               § 18. But what if S. Ambroſe mention not praying to Saints? No more he does (ſay you) of our mutuall praying for our enemies and the like. As if theſe were not the obiects and materials of our prayers, which are infinite in number, as Ariſtotle 
                  Indiuidua ſunt inſimta. tels vs, that all particulars are, and therefore not to be comprehended. We ſpeake of him to whome we are to direct them, which is ſoone learned, and moſt meet to be told, as Pater noſter, and nomen TVVM, and regnum TVVM, and the concluſion of all, quia TVVM, thrice repeated, of which I told you before. Euery clauſe, euery ſyllable in the pater noſter, ſhewes to whom we muſt pray. So no doubt would Ambroſe, commenting of prayer, haue directed vs to the Saints, if God had not ſufficed. But he is Shaddai ſo too.
               § 19. Yea but Numb. 36. you tell vs, that S. Ambroſe makes no mention of the Saints interceding for vs, which the Biſhop neuer theleſſe graunts. Is it therefore none? 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and an oxe with an aſſe. Good Lord how vnlike? For the one of theſe is free to thinke or not, the other of faith, that God muſt be prayed to. If he be on our ſide, Rom. 8. you know what followes, all other may be ſpared. Euen the Angels themſelues, euen then when they come ad denarium numenum, 
                  Chriſt is better then tenne Angels, that is, then all, ſaith Albinus Alcuin.
                   to the number of perfection, (decem principes eiuitatis, Eccles. 7. 20.) yet wiſedome is better then they, that

is Chriſt, ſayes Albinus, vpon the place before named. No doubt our Lord is all ſufficient to releeue vs. And, not praying to God, we can receaue no benefit from him; the Saints interceſſion which they make for vs, whether we ſleepe or wake, whether we know of it or not, is alike beneficiall to all. No ſuch reaſon therefore to determine this.
               § 20. S. Ambroſe himſelfe, of whome we ſpeake, vpon the words now quoted, Rom. 8. Semper cauſas noſtras agit apud patrem [Chriſtus.] Our Sauiour alwayes pleads our cauſes before his Father. And ſhall the Saints put in, where he is alway agent? This is worſe then ſpectante Roſcio geſtum agere, to interpoſe our Sauiour at pleading for vs, as if he were not either cunning or gracefull enough at it. Againe, Cuius poſtulatio contemni non poteſt (nor therefore, adiavari opus habet aduentitiâ aliquâ aduocatione) quia in dextra Dei eſt. Whoſe requeſt cannot be deſpiſed, becauſe he ſits at the right hand of God. Like vnto which Tertullian, Facilè impetratur ſemper quod filius 
                  De peenitent. 
                  poſtulat. That ſuite hath euermore eaſie ſpeeding which the ſonne makes, (Chriſt, to wit.) Neither does S. Ambroſe mention without cauſe, the ſitting of Chriſt at the right hand of Chriſt fits at the right hand of God to make requeſt for vs. his Father, to whet his mediation. Which S. Paul had mentioned, for the very ſame cauſe, in the place that hee comments vpon, Rom. 8. 34. And indeed but to Chriſt, it was neuer ſaid to any, Sede à dexteris meis, ſit on my right hand, Hebr. 1. 13. Which by collation of places, ſhewes, that there is none other interceſſor for vs, but he. Laſtly, thus S. Ambroſe, Ʋt de Deo patre ſecuri, & Chriſto filio eius, in eorum fide laetemur. That beeing confident of God the Father, and Chriſt his Sonne, we may reioyce in the faith that we haue in them. So as you ſee, faith and aduocation goes onely ſtill with Chriſt, not with the Saints.

NExt is Ruffinus lib. 2. hiſtoriae c. 33. who ſayes not, that Theodoſius did inuoke the Saints, but as the Biſhop anſwered you, and you cannot take away, that at the tombes of Martyrs he craued helpe of God, by the Saints intercoſſion. Which although it ſuppoſe their ſuing for vs, yet it is not coupled with our praying to them. What you bring out of Chryſoſtome, who names not Theodoſius, much leſſe points at this fact of his, as you dreame both here, and numb. 50. but onely ſpeakes vniuerſally of the Emperours, hath been replyed to before. We dreſſe no Crambe. Hee names Conſtantine. And if he meant Theodoſius, why does he not name him? But whomſoeuer he meanes, they may be 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , need the holy ones (ſuppoſe the Angels) and yet not pray to them, nor to Saints neither; and yet whether they doe or no, it makes no lawe. Heare S. Cyprian orat. de lapſis. Mandant aliquid Martyres fieri? Sed ſi ſcripta non ſunt in Domini lege quae mandant, antè eſt vt ſciamus illos de Deo impetrâſſe quod poſtulant, tunc facere quod mandant. That is, Doe the Martyrs commaund a thing to be done? But if that which they commaund be not written in Gods lawe, it is reaſon we ſhould firſt know, that God allowes what they aske, before we doe what they command. So as not onely the actions of mortall men, though neuer ſo godly, but the commands of Martyrs, appearing from heauen, muſt be examined by the law of God, ere they may be accompliſhed by S. Cypr. iudgement. Antè eſt vt ſciamus, &c. Yet you back it by Sozomen. lib. 7. hiſtor. cap. 24. out of whom that which you bring is but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in Sozomene, it is ſaid, or reported, though you amplifie it, by, commonly reported. Well what is it? Firſt you leaue out Theodoſius his going into the Church to pray to God, and to none elſe, that he names in that part of the ſentence. This you diſſemble, and leaue out, as not concerning the matter, though nothing more, who charge the Biſhop ſo cauſleſly and ſenceleſly elſe where for the ſame

fault; yea, when it is no fault. Secondly, as for the Temple which Theodoſius built in the honor of S. I. Baptiſt, we might aske you, how that agrees with S. Auſtens, Templum Martyribus 
                  De ciuit. dei. lib. 8. c. 27. Sic Greg. de Val. T. 3. Comm. Diſp. 6. q 11. puncto 5. de Idololatria. 
                  non ponimus? You will ſay, it was called by the Baptiſts name onely, and in memory of him. So, it may be, he but named or remembred the Baptiſt in his prayer, as he had good occaſion, conuerſing in the Church that might put him in minde of him. You haue both built Churches, and offered ſacrifice (though you cloake it neuer ſo much) to him and to Martyrs, contrary to S. Auſten. For doe you not offer ſacrifice in the honour of the Virgin? You will not deny it. How then does this differ from the Collyridian hereſie? To omit howe Vide eundem Greg. vbi ſuprà, frigidiſſimè & hoc & alia defendentem. Atque iterum in libris de rebus fidei controuerfis, lib. ſingulari de Idolol. eadem ad verbum repetentem. much more hainous a matter it is to offer Chriſt our Lord, in honour of his Mother, then a cake as they. The like I might ſay of vowes which you make to Saints by way of ſpecial honour, which the aforeſaid Valentia, ſeeking fowre wayes to iuſtifie, is moſt fowle in all. One time he ſaies, that the Saints are called for witneſſes of what we vow to God. A ſmall prerogatiue, and yet more then need too, euen this. Another time, that wee vowe to God indeed, but for loue to the Saints. As if God were not louely enough, or had not right enough to our vowes, but for the Saints ſake. A third time, that we doe this, becauſe we thinke the Saints are well pleaſed with ſuch ſeruice, when it is performed to God. But by this reaſon we may as well vowe to Saints in earth, and in mortalitie. Laſtly', he denies it to be an act of relligion, if it be done to the Saints; of which hereafter. As for Theodoſius, his calling S. Iohn Baptiſt to be his 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , it might be materialiter, that the pietie which hee had ſhewed in decking the Temple, with the name of the Baptiſt, for diſtinction ſake, might bee mentioned by him to God, to mooue him to fauour, as Ezechias and 
                     Nehem. 15. 14. Remember me, O my God, con

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and as our workes are ſaide to pray for vs, (vitalis oratio, Bellarmine acknowledges; another, that eleemoſyna orabit pro te) ſo this an imploration of S. Iohn Baptiſt, renuing the memorie of the Temple that bore his name, before God in his prayer. The ſtarres, are ſaid, to fight againſt Siſera. Heauen is called to reioyce ouer Babylon. So all the Saints out of their brotherly ſympathie, are our

                   at all times; vocati nec vocati; and yet when wee call for them, we may call for them of God, without praying to them. Ille educit theſauros ex abyſſis. This therefore, though there were no 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , prooues no praying to Saints. Whereas you ſay, that if we pray to S. Iohn Baptiſt, why not to others? We make no queſtion, but the reaſon is alike; but you haue heard our anſwer to Sozomens ſtorie, which at another time no man diſclaimes more then your ſelues, (Sozomenus multa mentitur in hiſtoria, Greg. de Ʋal. Tom. 4. Comm. Theol. p. 1952. The like iudgement giues Bellarmine both of him and Socrates, T. 2. edit. Ingolſtad. anni 1605. p. 487.) and remember, I pray you, that he ſaies, Theodoſius went in to pray to God, ſo as if he prayed to the Baptiſt, it was beſides his purpoſe.
               § 22. The Biſhops reaſons againſt prayer to Saints, becauſe we haue no ſuch warrant in the holy Scripture, and we know not if they heare vs or no, &c. how doe you refute? The Church of God, ſay you, the ſpouſe of Chriſt, the pillar of truth, hath done it before vs, with whome our Sauiour hath promiſed to be continually aſſiſtant. What then? And this is in ſtead of Scripture. To you it may be. But firſt you haue brought vs no ſuch teſtimonie of the Church, vnleſſe you think, that all that meete in a Church to heare a Sermon, or a Homilie, as they did Nyſſens, of whome we ſpake a little before, are a ſufficient aſſembly to counteruaile a Synode, which is the Church, without queſtion, from whome we ſhould looke for determination in ſuch cauſes, euen by your owne confeſſion. Yet now you are offended with vs, when we call for Synods. As

for, our Sauiours aſſiſtance with vs, to the end of the world, I ſee not how that prooues praying to Saints, but rather ſends vs from them to him, as to whome we haue not onely eaſie acceſſe, but himſelfe continually watching about vs. Doe you not read in the Cantic. how dangerous it is for the ſpouſe of 
                  Cant. 1. 7. 
                  Chriſt, to run a gadding after the flocks of the ſhepheards, though they be called his fellowes, or companions, but not fellowes in this. And againe in the ſame booke, Paululùm cum pertranſiſſem,

Where, if it were lawfull to adde any thing to that which hath beene anſwered to that place of the Apoſtle, ouer and ouer by our writers, I would ſay that he alluded to the two pillars, which the poſteritie of Seth are ſaide to Ioſeph. Antiq. l. c. 3. haue erected after the flood, containing diuers verities both phyſicall and Theologicall, moſt memorable in them, but not authorizing them at all. So happily the Church. For to her the depoſitum was committed coram teſtibus, as the Apoſtle ſaies in the next Epiſtle, 2. Tim. 2. 2. the truth, as I may ſay, engrauen in her, as it were in a marble pillar. But ſecondly, though the Church were neuer ſo infallible for her doctrines, yet ſhee might erre in her practiſe, as you confeſſe of the Pope. For euen the Church her ſelfe, is not more priuiledged with you, then the Pope, from error. Though we neuer read him called the pillar of truth, as we doe of others,

your argument?
               § 23. Theodorets beginning is very laudable, that they often 
                  Ex 8. lib. de Graec. morbis curandis. 
                  meete to ſing hymnes and praiſe to the Lord of Martyrs. If they went any further, I can but ſay with Epiphanius, Haereſis eſt tanquam mala mulier, hereſie is like a ſhrewd woman, giue 
                  Contr. Collyrid. 
                  her no aduantage, no more then to the water, no not a little, let her not haue her will. If ſhee had beene curbed at the firſt, it had not come to thoſe riots, and extremities, that ſince we labour of. Though when I caſt mine eye vpon Theodorets owne text, not as you trenlace and tranſlate it at pleaſure, I ſee very little to make for you, if ought at all. Firſt, he reports onely faſhion or vſe, and that not generall, which you promiſe in your title of this ſeauenth Chapter. Doe you ſee then how quickly you are fallen away from your tearmes, which very tearmes were not anſwerable to the primitiue challenge, although you had kept them; which called for ſanction not for practiſe, for rules of Fathers, not routs of people, &c. Neither does Theodoret ſay that the people made their prayers to Martyrs, but hauing ſpoken in the laſt words of the God of Martyrs, he addes immediatly of their praying, for all ſuch things as they ſtand in neede of, but ſpecifies not to whome they prayed for them, whether to God, or to the Martyrs. To whome then rather, then to the God of Martyrs? His words are, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. Thirdly, if there prayers were made at firſt to the Martyrs, to them alſo ſhould their thanks for ſpeeding be returned. Of which thankes he ſpeakes in theſe words, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . But your ſelues in your Liturgyes, ſieldome returne thankes to the Saints or Martyrs, of which I am to ſpeake in another place. And indeede, if thankes are to be returned to the Saints, can it be but that God is in exceeding great danger of looſing his honour, with whome ſuch partners ſhall communicate? And as for 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , it does not force that they prayed to the Martyrs to accompanie them, whoſe companie they might

begge as well of God, and he licence them. Which neuertheles would be thought of, how poſſibly it can ſtand with another clauſe of Theodorets in that very chapter, viz. the ſoules of Saints, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , raunge about heauen, and their bodies are disperſed into diuers townes and countries. How then could they accompanie the poore way-faring man, but that Theodoret turnes rhetoricall, and meant no other, then onely to oppoſe to the Gentile gods lately by him named, or ſuch as intruded vpon the honour of God, Antiochus, Hadrian, Ʋespaſian, &c. the exaltation of Chriſtian Saints, ſo farre as was compatible with Chriſts true Relligion? And therefore correcting himſelfe, he is faine to ſay, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ; not abſurdly diſtinguiſhing betweene dulia and latria, as your braines crowe, but deprecating the ſcandall which his former words might ſeeme to imply. Where we haue alſo the gifts and donaries before ſpoken of, offered to God in plaine and direct tearmes, not to the Martyrs. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : For their Maſter accepts them, ſaies he, [not they,] As for 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , let the Saints pray for vs as much as you will, that is nothing to our queſtion of praying to them. And yet Theodoret addes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . This ſhewet, that their God is the true God. Which confirmes what I ſaid, in the former Chapter, of Mamas ſpoken of in S. Baſil, that Deus Mamantis, Mamas his God, and ſo here, the Martyrs God, they are mentioned to this end, to ſhew that the peoples recourſe vnto them, was not as to certaine fauourites, and vnder-officers of the great King, to diſpence largeſſes, but as worſhippers of the ſame God, (euen with loſſe of their deareſt blood lately in their life time,) in whoſe honourable ſeruice themſelues reioyced, and the rather becauſe dignified by ſuch noble partners, and fellow-ſeruants. Laſtly, ſhewing of what trades and occupations of life, diuerſe of thoſe Martyrs were while they liued, he reckons vp very meane ones, not to call them baſe, and concludes thus; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  :

That is, Of ſuch men and women conſiſts the Quire of Martyrs. Yet Parſons that hell-hound (your worthy In his Three Converſions of England, but namely part. 3. in the moneth of March. Chap. 7. predeceſſor, or if you will, progenitor, into your world of Anticks) ſcoffs at ſhoomakers, and beere-brewers, and ſuch kind of people, that they ſhould be thought Martyrs fit for a Calender, or able to diſcern what faith they died for. You heare what Theodoret here not onely confeſſes, but vaunts of. Of ſuch men and women conſiſts the Quire of Martyrs. And what ſaies the Apoſtle? Non multi nobiles, &c. Or what kind of trade is contemned in Scripture, towards the advancing of Chriſts Goſpel, fiſhing, tanning, weauing, tent-making, and ſuch like? Eccleſia Chriſti de vili plebecula congregata eſt, ſayes S. Hierome lib. 3. Comm. in Epiſt. ad Gal. And Oneſimus the fugitiue (Baronius writ it, if I remember) ſucceeded the Apoſtle S. Iohn in his Biſhopricke of Epheſus. But Parſons hath anſwered this by this time, and many other matters; I vrge him no farther.

Onely take you heede, how you beleeue the Saints (as here you ſeeme to doe) to It followes, not-onely that, &c. but that Saintsheare the prayers that are made vnto them, ſeeing that they obtaine the graunt therof, and giue ſuccour to their ſuppliants.

               § 25. The reuelation of viciſſitude or per interualla that Saints may haue, as Elizeus of Naaman and Gehezi, and the like, is not enough to auouch praying to them. It muſt be permanentiae, it muſt be ſpiritus manens & non tranſiens. Elſe we may pray to them, when they heare vs not, and when nothing is reuealed. This man hath prayed to me, and I was not aware, or Dominus abſcondidit à me, as the Prophet ſaid. So ſhall we be ſure that they doe not euer heare vs, but whether they doe euer heare vs or no, we ſhall not be ſure. Can there be any thing more diſparageable to a poore ſuiter then this? This to your numb. 46.
               § 26. Whereas you ſay in the 47. that they know our prayers, by the relation of Angels. Firſt, how ſhall the Angels know them to relate? By reuelation from God, you will ſay. But he that reueales to the Angels, might reueale to the Saints eâdem operâ. What needs this reuelation then? Sic fieri per plura, quod potuit per pauciora? Secondly, who makes that the Angels worke, to be offerers of our prayers to the Saints in heauen? Is this worthy of them? Is this a fit worke to imploy Angels about? Why not rather to my ſelfe, ſaies the Angel? And ſurely if this be once entertained, that the Angels acquaint the Saints with our prayers, which elſe they ſhould not know but for them, will not the Pagan opinion which S. Ambroſe hiſſed out, and you with him, euen now, returne, that God alſo ſhould be ignorant of our affaires, vnleſſe the Angels reuealed them? For you make the Angels, to offer our prayers to God too.

Dionyſius therfore moſt properly cals it ſubſtantiam fidei, the ſubſtance or liuelihood of our faith, ſuppoſe that by which it is fedde, as you would ſay, and nouriſhed, and maintained. Likewiſe, Thy teſtimonies haue I claimed as mine HERITAGE for euer, ſaies the Prophet Dauid, in the Pſalme before named. So as the King you ſee, conſiſts by the tillage of this field, and they are his for euer, euen as in the nature of an inheritance, as was before ſaid. Apollinaris (in

Biſhop of Hierapolis, writing to a friend of his, Avircius Marcellus, about the hereſie of the Cataphrygians, alleadges this as a cauſe of his ſlow ſetting forward to write (euen againſt thoſe heretiques,) ne quicquam apponere viderer Euangelico verbo noui teſtamenti: leaſt writing ſo much as one line after the Canon of holy Scripture, he might ſeem to haue a mind to adde to her moſt compleat ſufficiencie. S. Gregorie alſo the great, lib. 1. Epiſt. 24. ad quatuer Patriarchas, ſaith, that as the Prieſt in old times was wont to conſult God in doubtfull caſes, apud arcam teſtamenti, at the Arke of the Couenant, or of the teſtimony, ſo Eccleſiaſticall rulers are to performe the ſame now, [apud arcam teſtamenti Dominum conſulunt] ſi de his in quibus dubitant intus apud ſemetipſos ſacri Eloquij paginas requirant. The Paſtors then conſult the Arke of the Teſtament, when concerning thoſe things that they make doubt of in their minds, they haue recourſe to the pages of the word of God in their breſts.

Wherefore againe the ſame Gregorie, whereas the Church in the Canticles is called a Doue, he giues this reaſon of it, becauſe the Doues propertie is to gaze vpon the riuers, and ſo

Habitet in vobis verbum Chriſti copioſè in omni ſapientia, &c. is not nice to affirme, that omnis ſapientia is where Chriſti verbum is, all wiſdome is there where Chriſts word and warrant is. And reckoning but thoſe fower braunches of wiſedome, firſt, to know the holy Trinity, then the manner of worſhip belonging vnto it, thirdly, godly coueting after the Kingdome of heauen, fourthly, good works and honeſt life in this world, he concludes thus, In huiuſmodi rebus eſt omnis ſapientia quam Chriſtianus habere debet in hac vitâ, that is, In ſuch things as theſe, ſtands all the wiſedome, that a Chriſtian man needs to haue in this life. What then ſhould we doe with Saints and Angels, and the worſhipping of them, after the holy Trinity religiouſly ſerued by vs, vnto which S. De Orat. dominic. Obſerue that word Obſeruance, For by that, Greg. de Val. his diſtinction is taken away, that denyes the worſhip of relligion to Saints, but graunts the worſhip of Obſeruance. See hereafter, Cap. 8.

                  Church, is a bauble which the foole hath gotten by the ende, and brandiſheth it as gloriouſly as if it were Hercules his clubbe. We haue ſeene no ſuch, I tell you. Eccleſia Dei non habet talem conſuetudinem, vix vel ſimplicem praxin. And yet if you thinke to facere populum, and carrie the cauſe by many voices, I muſt tell you with the ſame S. Hierome, whome you quote ſo riſe, lib. 3. contra Pelag. prope finem, that, Multitudo ſociorum nequaquam te Catholicum ſed haereticum demonſtrabit. To alleadge multitudes on your ſide, will make you thought to be an hereticke, not a Catholicke. The like I haue quoted to you out of S. Chryſoſtome before, Hom. 8. in Act. Apoſt. And in briefe, what cuſtome can doe, you may learne of your fellow Sa, in Aphariſmis, v. feſtum. namely, that faires may be kept, and the mill driuen vpon the holy-day, with ſome other things, which certaine of you wil ſcarce excuſe frō 
                  mortal ſinnes, (as he ſaies;) but the ſalue of all is, Licet, concedente id conſuetudine: It is lawfull, becauſe cuſtome permits it. Is it not reaſon that wee

               § 29. What can be more abſolute, or more powdred with that ſalt, which our Sauiour cōmends, then the Biſhops anſwer to S. Auſtens authoritie, out of Serm. 17. de verb. Apoſtoli? that, for a man to be recommended to the prayers of the Martyrs, is to be intereſſed in the interceſſion of the myſticall bodie, &c. Chriſt onely beeing praied to, and yet God hearing both him and vs, while each is ſollicitous for the neede of others, no leſſe then of himſelfe.

So Chriſt and the Martyrs. What they wiſh we haue, what he inſpires they wiſh; and yet we ſeeke not to the Martyrs, but to God onely.

God be thanked at what time I was writing theſe things, the news was (and true he graunt, as wee doubt not but he will of his grace, in the ende) that the King of France had acknowledged this title by proclamation in his Dominions, & ſeuerely threatned the contradictors. There is hope that this leauen which his MAIESTIE hath prepared, like the good houſe-wife in the Goſpell, by his moſt skilfull hand, will leauen more then one pecke in time, euen the other parts of the Chriſtian world.
               § 31. Espencaeus (and he a French Papiſt) ſaies, that Reges are prima & maxima capita populorum (euen Chriſtianorum, and therefore Eccleſiae. For what is the Church but Chriſtian people?) How then doth this differ from our KINGS

The like he hath often in his foreſaid Digreſſions.
               
               § 32. Numb. 56. you ſay, S. Auſten denies no inuocation to the Martyrs, but ſacrificall and Prieſtly onely. For he addes, you ſay, whoſe Prieſt he is, namely Gods: and you conſtrue it thus, that becauſe the Prieſt is Gods Prieſt, & ought to ſacrifice to God alone, therefore he doth not inuocate the Martyrs in his ſacrifice. But the Biſhops queſtions will neuer be anſwered, If at Mattens, why not at maſſe? If not the Prieſt, why others? Might a layman, at the time when he communicates in the maſſe, priuately inuoke a Martyr, or no? If he may, what a foile is this, to S. Auſtens, Non inuocantur apud ſacrificium? If not, what difference is there, betweene Prieſt and lay-men then, in this point? For I hope it is lawfull, euen for a priuate man, not to participate your maſſe, without a priuate inuocation, euen in the act of that ſeruice. And are Prieſts ſet onely to offer ſacrifice? Is not bleſſing and praying a Prieſtly function, as it is exerciſed in the Church? or does not the force of the ſacrifice ſtand in inuocation? The Saints therefore, and the Martyrs, being remooued from the one, they are remooued from the other, by S. Auſten. But if you admit them to the one, as you doe to Inuocation, you cannot repell them from Sacrifice neither. It comes here to my minde, that as S. Chryſoſtome notes lib. 1. contra Indaees, that God gaue the Iewes leaue to ſacrifice to himſelfe (though he delight not in ſacrifice) rather then to deuills: ſo, if the fathers could be conuinced to haue winked at this error, not weighing the conſequence of it, yet it was rather to alienate the peoples mindes from Idolls, then that they thought it good relligion to pray to Saints. Sure I am, that in the third councell of Carthage (which is both auncient in it ſelfe, and confirmed by the ſixt generall

Councell in Trullo) there was prouiſo made, that no man ſhould preſume to vſe a forme of prayer, diſſident from the common, till he had conſulted with certaine brethren of the better inſtructed ſort (ſo ſpeakes the Councell) and that alwaies at the Altar, the praier ſhould be directed ad patrem, to the Father, not excluding thereby the other two perſons of the Trinity (S. Hieron. in Ep. Pauli. item Chryſoſt. & Aug. in varijs locis. & S. Athan. in Epiſt, ad Serapion.
                   as all diuines agree) but yet Saints, and creatures, whatſoeuer.
               § 33. You referre vs to S. Auſten de cura pro mortuis, c. 4. which the Cardinal brought not: but ſtill you may helpe him, ſuc Mineruam. What ſaies S. Auſten there? I ſee not what helpe the dead may receiue (belike 
                     Baronius Annal. Tom. 2. Anno 226. ſect. 12. brings another reaſon out of Maximus, as if the very neighbourhood of the Saints bodies auailed the ſoules of them that lie buried by them, againſt damnation: ſo does ſuperſtition encreaſe in deſpight of S. Auſten here, after once it hath broken looſe: yet Maximus hauing aſcribed ſomewhat to the Saints, dares not reſt there, but brings vs home to our ſelues againe, as time was, ſaying, Attamen conſocij ſanctitate.
                   by beeing buried in Churches) but onely that whiles the liuing remēber where their bodies lie, they may by prayer recommend them to the ſame Saints, as to their patrons, who haue receiued them into their protection. Where, a man might aske you, if alreadie they are receiued into the Saints protection, what further neede of recommendation? But the burying in Churches, is but a cold recommending to the mercies of Saints, howſoeuer you magnifie it. By the way you conſtrue, apud dominum adiuvandos commendent, they may commend them to be holpen with Almightie God, as if apud dominum depended of adiuvandos, and not of commendent.

               But in a word to S. Auſten. Doe you ſee how little this makes for praying to Saints? I ſee no other cauſe (ſaies he) but this. He affirmes not this cauſe then, but ſeeking the cauſe of a cauſeleſſe zeale that men haue one way, he lights

vpon this, which eftſoones he refutes. But they might do that (ſaies he) as well, though they were not buried there, &c. And yet ſhall this be brought for S. Auſtens iudgement about prayer to Saints? which perhaps the very multitudes would not bring for themſelues. Of affectus recordantis, and precantis, I there read: but affection is no good rule to rectifie the conſcience by, ſpecially popular, and of them that wee know not what they were.

               § 34. By the way, you wiſh vs, to marke the faſhion of praying for the dead. Which although it be nothing to our queſtion, yet it neither followes halfe currantly out of the wordes that you here quote, nor aduantageth you one whit, albeit it were graunted. For all your ſtriuing about prayer for the dead, is for Purgatorie, as we knowe, whoſe walls riſe not at the others riſing. Neither is euery Purgatorie, that hath beene fancied, alike. S. Hierome reports vpon Epheſ. 6. the opinion of ſome that ſhould thinke, that no mans conflicts end with death, and that there are tentations expecting vs after our deliuerance from the bodie. Which they would alſo ground vpon the Apoſtles words in that place. Non omne aduerſus diabolum praelium morte finitur. Sed cùm de iſto ſaculo exierimus, tunc nobis fortius & apertius praeſentibus contra praeſentes eſt futurum certamen. And, Non poteſt aliquis omnia in praeſenti vitâ operari. Sed 2. Cor. 5. ſiue in praeſenti, ſiue in futuro, ſtudendum eſt placere Domino. For thither alſo they would drawe thoſe words of the Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the Corinthians. S. Hierome deliuers not his iudgement hereof, one way nor another, much leſſe ſhal I needmine. Onely we may wel lament our caſe, me thinks, if there be new temptations accoſting vs after this life, and that it is not enough to haue beene faithfull vnto the death.

For my part, I hope for a farre better condition, when wee haue quitted this. Or elſe, what get we by the exchange ſo much deſired? Yet your Purgatorie gets as little by this new purgation. For firſt, this is generall, and encloſeth all, Non poteſt aliquis omnia in praeſenti vitâ operari. Then neceſſary, not ſubiect to be diminiſhed or releaſed by the prayers of the liuing. Vpon which foundation neuertheleſſe, your market-houſe is erected. And laſtly, not torments, but tentations remaine for vs, and freſh combates, if theſe ſay true. Your pots may freeze then for all this Purgatorie. But at leaſt it followes from prayers for the dead; which you bid vs marke here. As if in the auncient Liturgies,

So as not onely in extaſie and tranſportation, as Valentia would, but in the daily forme of prayer, preſcribed by our Sauiour to the whole Church, the Saints are to pray for things alreadie had. But returne we where we left.
               § 35. The laſt is of Florentius, apoore old man of Hippo, who 
                  Aug. de cluit. dei, l. 22. c. 8. 
                  hauing loſt his cloake, S. Auſten ſaies, he praied at the monuments

of certaine Martyrs; but not to them. The young men ſcoft him, ſay you, for praying to the Martyrs. It ſeemes then, it was no ſuch vſe to doe ſo. For they were not Pagan young men, but more likely Chriſtian. And though they mocked him eo ipſo nomine, for praying to the Martyrs, yet it followes not that he did ſo: for euen our Sauiour was mockt as praying to Elias, when he praied to his Father onely. So it might be that neither Florentius praied to any but to God, and the young men mocking him as praying to the Martyrs, declared the iudgement of thoſe times and thoſe parts, which was, that Martyrs were not to be prayed to. You ſay, they mockt him not for praying to the Martyrs, but for requeſting of them, quinquagenos folles (ſo many pieces of money) towardes his cloake. Which is not likely, he would capitulate ſo preciſely with Saints, for the buying of a new cloake: but if he did, you may weigh his wiſdom, and thinke how fit a man to ſquare the faith of Gods Church by his actions. Cartoſus the cooke might ſay, Ecce quomodò Martyres te veſtierunt; behold how the Martyrs haue clothed thee, though neither Florentius praied to them, nor Cartoſus allowed ſuch praier to be lawfull, but onely comforting him againſt the taunts of the young men, who had impured that to him, to pray to Martyrs. S. Auſtens epiphonema, Cui niſi huic fidei atteſtantur iſta miracula, to what faith doe theſe miracles beare witnes, &c. hurts not vs, who denie not miracles, (though they that call for them vntimely, driue our Sauiour to groanes againe, Mark. 8. 12.) nor wiſh ill to Martyrs, and leaſt of all to Faith, but ſay, that faith in Saints, and prayer to the dead, are both of them repugnant to the right faith of our Lord Ieſus Christ.
               
            
            
               
               To the eight Chapter,
               
                  The Biſhops arguments againſt Praying to Saints are maintained (which the Adioynder ſaith, may be expected in all likelihood, that he ſhould ſatisfie, and therefore addreſſeth himſelfe thereunto in this chapter.) The Canon of the Church of England about the Croſſe in Baptiſme, neither guiltie of impoſture, nor any otherwaies to blame. Wrangling, iuggling, trifling, and the reſt of his braue Rhetorique wherewith he fronts the Biſhop, returned vpon himſelfe rather in proofe then words.
               
               § 1. YOV call it the Biſhops abuſing of Theoderet, to quote as much of the text onely, as was moſt pregnant to the matter in hand, beſides that you know his accuſtomed breuity: And yet profeſſing to lay downe Theodonets place, you dare not your ſelfe lay it downe at large. I will adde what you left out. The queſtion betweene vs ariſes of the 35. Canon of the Councell of Laodicea. Of that Theodoret in his Comment, vpon the 2. to the Coloſſ. thus. They which defended the law, did prouoke them alſo to the worſhip of Angels, ſaying that the law was giuen by them. Now this fault remained in Phrygia and Piſidia a long time. Wherefore

the Councell which mett at Laodicea, which is the Metropolis 
                  The Councell forbids praying to Angels. 
                  of Phrygia, by decree forbad praying to Angels. And to this day we may ſee, emong them, and their neighbours, Churches, or Oratories, to S. Michael. Moſt of this, good Sir, you left out, you I ſay, that blame the Biſhop for not putting in all. I imagine you were aſhamed of S. Michaels Oratories, which you haue multiplied, in ipſâ formâ, or that the idolatry to Angels, which the Councell forbids, is conſtrued by Theodoret 
                  The Papiſts maintaine cultū Angelorum, Angels worſhip, which is idolatry, by Theodorets expoſition of the Councell of Laodicek.
                   
                  cultus Angelorum, the worſhip of Angels, which worſhip of them at leaſt your ſelues defend. He goes forward, They therefore gaue this counſell in humblenes of mind, ſaying, the God of all things could not be ſeene nor comprehended, nor that we could come to him, and that we muſt procure Gods good will by Angels. This S. Theodoret calls baſeneſſe of minde, and the worſhipping of Angels. He calls it worſhipping of Angels I ſay, our ſeeking to procure Gods fauour to vs, by their mediation. Yet you doe ſo. And further, the Councell calls it Idolatry. You are idolaters therefore in ſo doing. Laſtly, it reformes that whole fault by forbidding prayer to Angels. Now thinke you therefore, whether Theodoret be againſt you, and the Councell of Laodicea, and whether you be idolaters, yea or no, for your reſorting to Angels, praying to them, ſingle worſhipping of them, though you went no further. And leaſt you thinke Theodoret conſtrues the Councell amiſſe, by ſaying it forbids prayer to Angels, when it forbids idolatry, (though the Councell be plaine, Ne nominemus Angelos, which is the Inuocation of them, or calling vpon their names, and it were hard to entertaine ſuch a thought of Theodoret, yet) heare Theodoret repeating the ſame againe, vpon the third Chap. to the Coloſſ. The Synode of Laodicea alſo following this rule, and deſirous to remedie that old diſeaſe, by ſtatute decreed, that none ſhould pray to Angels, nor forſake our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. What more euident, then that prayer to Angels was forbid by the Laodicean Councell, in Theodorets iudgement? No, ſay you, but the forſaking of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Pray to him, pray to Angels,

pray to both. Which the Councell ſaies not, as diſtinguiſhing betweene them that prayed to Angels alone, and them that pray to Not vnlike to Qu

T. would haue it ſo; which is the worſe. our Lord Ieſus Chriſt too, but they as I ſhall ſet downe in their owne wordes; That Chriſtians muſt not forſake the Church of God (by this you ſee that praier to Angels was not then receiued publiquely in the Church,) and depart aſide, (either as into corners, or from the tracke of the Church-faſhion and obſeruation) and name the Angels, (or call vpon them by way of prayer, as Theodoret conſtrued it) and make meetings, which is a thing forbidden, (viz. all the forenamed.) If any man therefore be found to vſe ſuch priuie idolatrie (they call it idolatrie, praying to Angels) let him be accurſed. Becauſe he hath forſaken our Lord Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, and betaken himſelfe to idolatrie. Now, ſay there are two kindes of worſhipping of Angels, one with Chriſt, another without, as your Valentia diſtinguiſhes of two kinde of idolatries, one lawfull, the other vnlawfull; Vbi ſupra.

Two euills (ſaies the Prophet) hath my people committed, digging falſe pitts that hold no water, and leauing mee the fountaine of life. So here.
               § 2. You ſay, Theodoret alleadges not any one word of the Canon, numb. 3. It is enough that Theodoret vnderſtood the Canon, and conſtrues that which they there forbid, to be praying to Angels. Either ſay that Theodoret miſtakes the ſenſe of the Canon, if you dare for your eares, or confeſſe you are concluded vnder the Councels curſe, for praying to Angels. And yet Angels, I hope, is one word of the Canon, which Theodoret vſes. And is not relinquere dominum noſtrum Ieſum Chriſtum, another clauſe of the ſame? which Theodoret hath in his Comment. vpon the 3. to the Coloſſ. But what talke you of words, when he giues you the ſenſe?
               
               
                  
§ 3. You ſay, the hereſie which the Councell forbid, was of ſuch, as thought we could not come to God, otherwiſe then by Angels, which you doe not. But the Councell firſt hath no ſuch words, but forbids the inuocating of Angels barely, without ſhewing their reaſon that were wont to vſe it, and Theodoret himſelfe doth not ſay otherwiſe, but only non poſſe perueniri, that is, that God was hid, and retired, and incomprehenſible, not to be come at, (viz. of himſelfe) and therfore that we muſt vſe the mediation of Angels; Which your ſelues would not ſticke to alleadge, to him that you would perſwade to worſhip Angels, and draw an argument from the remoteneſſe of Almighty God, to craue helpe of ſuch proctors, though you dare not deny the mediation of Chriſt. Meane while, herein you are worſe then they, for they ſay, God cannot be approached to without Angels, you ſay, Chriſt himſelfe muſt be approached to by the Angels, as if he did not offer himſelfe vnto vs, and ſo lead vs to God; for by him we haue entrance, &c.

Whatſoeuer you doe in word or in deede, doe all in the name of the Lord Ieſus, giuing thankes to God, and the Father, by him. By him (ſaith Theophylact) we muſt thanke the Father, by him pray to the Father, in his name doe all things. For as hee is our mediatour, to bring our perſons to his Father, at the firſt; ſo alſo to conuay our praiers to him for euer after. Where is your diſtinction become, between mediatour of redemption, and mediatour of interceſſion, if this may take place? Hee that brings our perſons, brings our praiers to the Father. And

that you may know, that not only Chriſt is to be embraced, & laid hold of, but the Angels to be quite caſheered in this worke of recommendation to almighty God, S. Chryſoſtome and S. Theodoret, both, thus proceed. If by Chriſt, then not by Angels. Theodoret as you quote him, vpon the 3. to the Col. in your 4. Numb. Vtter your thanks to God by Chriſt, and not by Angels. And as thanks, ſo praiers queſtionleſſe, 1. Tim. 2. 1. for thanks are a kind of prayers. Chryſoſtome ſo likewiſe, hom. 6. in 2. ad Coloſſ.

                  that leads to the Father) not in the Angels. That way (viz. the Angels) leads vs not thither: that is, the Angels haue no part at all in mediation to God for vs. And yet more pregnantly, if more may be, Hom. 9. in 3. ad Coloſſ. ver. 16. &c. Whether thou eate, or drinke, or marrie, or trauell, doe all in the name of God; that is, calling him for thine aſſiſtant, praying to him before all, and ſo ſet vpon thy buſineſſe. Wilt thou ſay any thing? ſet him firſt. For this cauſe wee (or as others read Paul) ſet the name of the Lord foremoſt in our (or as other his) Epiſtles. Where the name of the Lord is, there all things are proſperous. For if the names of the Conſuls make their writings to bee of force, much more ſhall the name of Chriſt doe the ſame. This alſo may bee the Apoſtles meaning here, that we ſhould ſay and doe all in the name of God, as hath been ſhewed, or in affiance towards God, not bringing the Angels. Doeſt thou eate? thanke God both afore thou eate, and afterward. Doeſt thou ſleepe? Thanke God both afore thou ſleepe, and afterward. Doeſt thou goe to the market place? Doe the ſame. Doe all in the name of the Lord, and all things ſhall goe well with thee. Whereſoeuer the name of God is ſet, there all things are proſperous. If it expell deuills, if it driue away diſeaſes, much more wil it giue eaſie riddance to thy buſines. And what is that that the Apoſtle ſayes, Whether in word or deed? That is, either praying, or doing any thing elſe. Hearken how Abraham diſmiſſed his ſeruant, in the name of God; how in the name God Dauid ouercame Goliah. Maruellous is his name, and very great. Againe, Iacob ſending away his ſonnes, ſaith, My God giue you grace in that mans ſight. For hee that doth ſo,

hath God for his aide, without whome he durst doe nothing. God therefore in recompence of the honour, wherwith a man honoureth him, by calling vpon him, will honour him againe, by giuing good ſucceſſe vnto his buſineſſe. Call vpon the 
                  Chriſtian inuocation hath this property' that one perſon beeing praied to, all are praied to. Which is not ſo in prater to Saints. For neither, if one Saint be called vpon, another is, nor if the Saint be praied to, therefore is God called on. And this latter much leſſe. Becauſe God and the Saints are farther off in nature, then the Saints betweene themſelues. Which ſhews how repugnant praier to Saints is to the Chriſtian inuocation. 
                  Sonne, giue thankes to the Father. For when the Sonne is called vpon, the Father is called vpon: and when we giue thankes to the Son, we thanke alſo the Father. Let vs learne to performe theſe things (let the Ieſuites learne, if they loue their ſaluation) not onely in words but in deeds. Nothing is of like force to this name, (the name of God) this name is wonderfull in all places. For thy name (ſaith hee) is like vnto oyntment powred out. Whoſoeuer names this name, he is ſtraight-waies filled with moſt ſweet ſauour. No man can call Ieſus the Lord, but in the holy Ghoſt. This name workes ſo great things. If thou ſayeſt by faith, IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, Eph. 2. 18 We haue acceſſe to the father, through Chriſt, in one Spirit. The whole Trinitie is named; but no Saint needfull to the procuring of our acceſſe. AND OF THE SONNE, AND OF THE HOLY GHOST, thou haſt effected all. See how great things thou haſt done. Thou haſt created a man, and done all elſe that is wont to be done by baptiſme. This is that fearefull name, that commaunds ſickeneſſes. For this cauſe THE DEVILL BROVGHT IN ANGELS, (their ſeruice or worſhip) envying vs the honour (of hauing to doe with God onely.) Theſe are the enchantments of the deuills. Though he be Angel, though Archangel, though a Cherubim, endure it not. For indeede the verie (heauenly) powers themſelues, will not endure it, nor admit it, but will repulſe and reiect it, when they ſee their Maſter diſhonoured. I haue honoured thee, ſaith hee, and I haue ſaid, Call vpon me. And doeſt thou diſhonour him? If thou but faithfully apply 
                  Note this conſequence of S. Chryſoſt. which the Ieſuits deride. Call vpon me, ſaith God: Ergò not vpon creatures, though they be Saints or Angels.

And if happily thou ſhalt not be able to conquer the diſeaſe, yet know that it is for the good of the partie, not for the weakeneſſe of thy charme. According to thy greatneſſe, ſaith hee, ſo is thy praiſe. By the vertue of this name, the world was conuerted, the tyrannie diſſolued, the deuill trampled, the heauens opened. And

gloſes, wherewith you guild ouer your idolatrie, abominable though it be, yet perhaps not outwardly, and therefore not ſo called by the Councell) but it cannot be the ſame you ſay, becauſe then S. Paul ſhould be an idolater, exciting the Corinthians, the Romanes, and Theſſalonians, to pray for him, &c. For he hath for ſaken the Church of God, (mutuall prayers agree not with Church-diſcipline) and renounced Chriſt, &c. Will this balductum neuer be left? Alſo Iacob ſhould be an idolater, becauſe of, Angelus qui eruit me, the Angel that deliuered me, bleſſe theſe children.

I thinke not. No nor yet, that we haue all, our particular Angel; which is another thing that you ſtand vpon. By this reaſon, we ſhould pray but to one among them all; and how ſhall we know him, or how diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of the companie, that we be not vnthankfull to him, that wee may ſpeake properly, when we pray vnto him?

As for Numb. 12. the next in your bill; Whereas, the Biſhop (you ſay) argues againſt praying to Saints, out of Reaſon and Diſcourſe; why not rather then you, (for as well is too little, conſidering the cauſe in hand) that bring your inducements of praying to them, from the like heads many times? As twice in this chapter, from the practiſe of people, from the ſenſe of their benefits, from conformities & congruities with other Scriptures, though teſtimonies of Scripture you are able to ſhew none direct, neither indeede endeauour you. Aboue all, that if charitie remaine in them, they will helpe vs, and beeing potent they can; and, that they know our caſe, and behold our eſtate, or elſe they were not compleatly bleſſed, if they ſhould wiſh vs well, and yet not know how we did.

Simple may we be, but not ſacrilegious. Quae ſine periculo ignorantur, oppugnantur etiam quandoque cum laude. Faith hath her aſſurance, and ſenſe hers.

Were it as euident as the former, though we might ſift it happily, with an argument or two, for diſcourſe ſake, yet we would not perſiſt in the denyall of it, as now, when neither Scripture abets it, and ſounder antiquitie makes againſt it. He ſaies, We know not how the Saints, pray for vs: Suppoſe we doe not, the matter is not great. Yet we muſt be ſure they heare vs, and perhaps know how, before we pray to them. For they may doe vs good, though we be not aware of it; haue reference to them we may not, vnleſſe we haue good ground for it. Howbeit, whereas he ſayes, wee cannot conceiue how the Saints pray for vs, if the Saints haue reaſon and affection remaining with them, as doubtleſſe they haue, what difficultie is it to conceiue howe they ſhould pray for vs?

The heart is deceitfull, and who ſhall ſearch it, who gage it? ſaies Ieremie. For which cauſe, S. Iohn ſaies, God is greater then our heart: onely God.

As certaine the eues when they would know what ſtore of gold is hidden in a houſe, that they beſet, they fling in ſome handfulls of ſmaller ſands, at the windowes, that by the ſound of that in the fall, they may iudge whether any treaſure be within or no, and not looſe their labour; ſo the thoughts of the heart are ſubiect to knowledge, by ſuch or ſuch ſignes, vpon prouocation. Which may hold well enough in matter of repentance, to ſee whether the ſinner will returne to his old

courſes or no, but is no way to know what he begs in prayer. To omit, that our Sauiours words might be conſtrued by ſuppoſition, that ſo great is the ioy for repenting ſinners, as Angels would haue their part in it, if they knew it, and when they know it, then they haue de facto. Heauen and earth in Apocal. another place are inuited to reioyce ouer Babylon, your Babylon, by a figure of hyperbole, for the wrongs that you haue done them. Laſtly, Revelatio viciſſitudinis, or intervalli, is one thing, as I told you before, ſtatae permanentiae another. The firſt may ſuffice to verifie the ſaying, Luk. 15. of the ioy of Angels ouer repenting ſinners, but that they ſhould know our prayers whenſoeuer we make them, more is required.
               § 14. The like I might ſay to your inſtance of Samuel, who told Saul all that was in his heart, namely concerning the matter then in hand. Of Elizeus, that ſaw Gehezi by tranſitory reuelation, and diſcouered what the king of Syria did in his priuy chamber. The preſenting of our Sauiours glorious body to S. Steuens eyes, is not comparable with an intuitiue ſpeculation of the thoughts, though this alſo was at a glimpſe, and not ordinary, whereas the Saints muſt haue ordinary to heare vs at all times, if they will be called vpon.

After death and in the day of iudgement. Time enough therefore if they know all things in the laſt iudgement. What is that to prayer to them, which muſt be in the meane while, if it be at all?

Baſil aſcribes to them, may be with knowledge of our outward wayes, without knowledge of the inward, to which our prayers belong. And yet

againe he may be cuſtos or protector of vs, that watches ouer our ſafetie with prayers, and with good wiſhes, though he know not ſo much as our outward eſtate. As Iob, when he praied for his children, vnknowing to them; as S. Paul when he ſaid, abſens corpore, praſens ſpiritu, and yet knew not what they did, but loue linked him; nor might they petition to him in ſuch abſence. Spectator actuum an Angell may be, as you quote out of S. Ambroſe, and yet not cogitatuum, 
                  De viduit. which is prayers cheife ſeat, as hath been often told you.
               § 17. Wee ſay not, that Saints are ſhut vp in a coffer, as you malitiouſly ſlaunder vs, with Vigilantius. Wee graunt they follow the Lambe whetherſoeuer hee goes, but ſignanter dictum, ſequuntur non praeeunt, they follow him, not goe before him, that is, they applaude his reſolutions of ſhewing mercy to his Church, not importune him alwaies with freſh demaunds, only ſighing for our ſaluation in generall. The bleſſed Martyr Fructuoſus, as you may read in Baronius, Tom. 2. Anno. 262. when he was haſting to his martyrdome, and now come to the ſtage of his execution, one Felix requeſted him to haue him in minde, [belike after death] To whom the holy Martyr and Biſhop anſwered, clarâ voce & audientibus cunctis; In mente me habere neceſſe eſt eccleſiam Catholicam ab oriente vſ

Limiting thereby his prayers, to the Vniuerſall eſtate of Chriſts Church here vpon earth, and no longer owning particular ſuits, after his departure out of the body. As he that giues vs the Contents of the ſecond Tome of Baronius, in the ende of the booke, vnderſtands thoſe wordes more peremptorily yet then ſo. Non eſſe orandum ſibi niſi pro Eccleſiâ Catholicâ, that he may not pray for any but onely for the Church. Whereas what if they ſhould pray for the generall of mankind? But I muſt further follow you.
               § 18. S. Gregories ſpeculum, is reiected by your ſelues. Adioynd. Num. 21.
                  
Is it like the Saints ſee as much as God? Doe they ſee him as much as he is to be ſeene? Doe they comprehend him, in quantum comprehenſitilis eſt? Yet himſelfe does ſo; And if by ſeeing him, they ſee as farre into him, as the nature of things is reſplendent in him, they ſhould doe this, and all. He meanes, the preſence and contemplation of God excludes all wretched and woefull ignorance from them, and fills them full of happines, but after the meaſure of their capacity. And though they could diſcerne all that is in God, yet it is a queſtion whether he would not reſtraine them from ſome things purpoſely, ſpeculum voluntarium, not naturale. Though they affect vs well, as wee confeſſe, yet their felicity ſtands not in the knowledge of our welfare, but in ſubmitting themſelues and all their deſires to the pleaſure of God, of whome wee read, that he ſhall be all in all in them, but not that they ſhall be all in all in him. I meane, to ſee all that is to be ſeen by him.
               § 19. I haue omitted one thing in the 17. Numb. that the Saints offer vp our prayers vnto God, Apoc. 5. for ſo you quote. In all which chapter neuertheleſſe, there is no mention of offering at all. The 24 Elders are ſaid to haue harpes, that is, the inſtruments of praiſe, and vialls full of ſweete odors, which the holy Ghoſt expounds, to be the prayers of the Saints. But their owne as well as others, for ought I know. Either their thankſgiuing to God, for their wonderfull redemption, as v. 12. (for thankſgiuing is reckoned a kinde of prayer:) or, becauſe you are ſo delighted with the Biſhops graunt, the interceſſions which they continually make for vs. As for the 8. chapter of the ſame booke, where you read thus, Another Angel came, and much incenſe was giuen him, to the ende that he might, dare de orationibus Sanctorum, offer, as you conceiue it, of the prayers of the Saints, the originall Greeke reads, dare orationibus, that he might giue of that In eadem opinione eſt Viega in hunc locu

                     n, nec Ribera negat multos ſentire. incenſe to the prayers of the Saints, not offer them himſelfe. Which Angel, S. Primaſius expounds to be Chriſt, ſo Beda, ſo Ausbertus, (our Rhemiſts inſinuating though not

expreſſing ſo much) S. Auſten before them all, Hom. 6. in Apocal. and therefore he is called another Angell, as eminent aboue the former; and he indeede graces our prayers with his merits, as it were with ſweete odours, to make them acceptable to God; Or if you will needes take it of the created Angels, you ſee they adde no merits of their owne to countenance our prayers with, but borrow incenſe from the Altar, that is, Chriſts merits from him, for he is our Altar, Hebr. 13. Data ſunt ei thymiamata multa, as hauing none of his owne. Which is enough to ouerthrow the mediation of Angels, though there were no more. For by a ſcheme of ſpeach, they are made to be caſters on of the perfume, though it be Chriſt alone that can diſpence his owne merits, and the Angels are ſtrangers to them.

               § 22. Though more particularly I might reply to his fond exception, vnto the place aforenamed out of Deuter. 12. (which he ſaith was only a rule for ſacrifice) that the ſame precept was giuen afore, euen Deut. 4. and without any mention of ſacrifices, ſometimes applyed to all the commandements ver. 2. againe, ver. 5. againe, ver. 8. particularly againſt idolatry ver. 15. to which this, of praying to Saints, is thought to be reducible. Therefore Bellarmine anſwers that place another way, lib. 4. De verbo. Dei cap. 10. Not that we muſt doe no more then is commanded vs, but in a thing commaunded, no more for ſubſtance, then the commaundement importeth. Which is enough for vs, as I haue often ſaid, that God therefore is not to be prayed vnto, by the mediation of Saints, vnles he had commaunded it; becauſe that is not ſo much an appertinence, or a bare forme, as a wrong ſeruice, a ſubſtance by it ſelfe.

The number of their Saints is after the number of their cities, yea verily their perſons.
               § 24. A new deuice in the 28. number; that though it were true as the Biſhop affirmeth, that we may not depart one inch, from Gods preſcript and will, yet the will of God reacheth further then his written word. Let him ſhew, that this holds concerning the ſubſtance of Gods ſeruice, we contend not with him for minutiae, for ſuch accidents as may adeſſe and abeſſe (ſaith Porphyrie) without corruption of the maine.

To place a Saint in Gods throne, to S. Iohn thought this a ſufficient reſtraint of ſuperfluous prayer, 1. Ioh. 5. 16. Non dico, I doe not ſay, inſinuating, that in praier we muſt hold no other courſe, then Scripture leads to, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ; how much more then, whē the Scripture ſhall ſay, No, or Vide ne, as the Angel himſelfe ſaid to S. Iohn? Apoc. 22. addreſſe our worſhip to him, to poure out our heart and conſcience into his lap, to ſubmit vnto him by prayer and deuotion, is no ſuch pettie thing, whatſoeuer hee imagines, but toucheth the foundations. Where this is offered, ſtrange fire is offred, vnles God authorize it.
               § 25. To the place of Chryſoſtome, vpon that text of the Apoſtle, Tenete traditiones, 2. Theſſ. 2. eâdem fide digna ſunt, tam illa quàm iſta. No doubt whatſoeuer the Apoſtles deliuered, either by word, or writing (and they might deliuer by word, what they did not by writing, as long as they were points of meaner nature, eſpecially ſome of them, that wrote nothing at all) I ſay, whatſoeuer the Apoſtles deliuered, no doubt but all deſerued credit, and credit alike, ratione annuntiantium, in regard of their perſons, which were farre from lying, but not as to force vs to the like obligation of beleeuing and crediting them, in the way of ſaluation, or to eternall life. And doe ye thinke, we could muſter no authorities of Fathers, if the time would permit, or we were ſo diſpoſed, to ſhew that all is contained in Scripture, which we are either to practiſe, or beleeue, as by neceſſitie of commandement, and how that entring into that Sanctuarie (the Sanctuarie of Scripture, and reuelation from aboue) Simulac introiut in Sanctuarium, tunc cognoui Pſa.
                   we may be inſtructed and certified about any points ſufficiently? As Rebecca to the Oracle, when there was ſtrife in her wombe; ſo we in controuerſies. The Scriptures are called Oracles, Rom. 3. I am wiſer then my teachers (ſaith he,) but how? by ſtudying thy Law.

Theſſ. 2.) to the declaration of truth (ſaith Athanaſius,) the holy Scriptures are ſufficient and compleat. And are the Scriptures ſo ſufficient to beat downe Ethniques, whome Athanaſius there writes againſt, and who care not for Scripture, as is commonly ſeene, and yet ſhall they not be ſufficient to compound controuerſies ariſing in the Church, betweene Chriſtian and Chriſtian?

As a man will not ſet foote to ground in a darke night, but hee will haue a candle borne before him, ſo Gods word muſt be the direction to all our

deeds; yea deedes, words, and thoughts. S. Chryſoſtome, I graunt, obſerues in a cértaine place, that it is a ſigne that God is not ſo well pleaſed with vs, as of old, becauſe now he writes to vs, rather then ſpeakes and confers as he was wont. Mittit

And yet Orlandine the Ieſuite in his Hiſtoria ſocietatis Ieſu, lib. 1. num. 27. ſaies of Ignatius their founder, that he, quamvis nulla extarent ſacrarum monumenta ac teſtimonia literarum, tamen fidei dogmata, & tenere rectè poſſet, & tradere, &c. Hee could deliuer points of faith, though there were no Scripture, well enough. Doe you ſee the Ieſuites drift, to eaſe vs of Scripture by all meanes they can, and they care not how? either by dreaming of ſuch a perfection, and entirenes with God, as needs no Scripture (as hee ſaid of Ignatius) which is their pride; or taking away that verie remaining token of Gods loue, and manner of communicating himſelfe vnto vs, which is by writing (as S. Chryſoſtome had ſaid) and argues nothing but their deteſtable crueltie, and regardleſſe behauiour towards the ſoules of Chriſtian people. But let vs heare you farther.

                  writing. No more hee doth of faſting perhaps, of feeding our parents, of waging warre for our countrie, not literally, not expreſſely, but yet inſinuatiuely and intentionally, euen of lifting vp our enemies beaſt out of the ditch. Wherof none is preſcribed totidem verbis, in our Sauiours doctrine, yet all of force iſſuing and flowing from the ſame. The word Honour in the 5.

So, Preach the Goſpel: Predicate euerie way, vijs & modis, by writing too; by printing and publiſhing, though long ſince deuiſed. S. Gregory ſaith vpon the 9. of Ezech. as I take it, that our Sauiour appeared with a writers Inke-horne at his backe, cum atramentario adrenes, becauſe though hee writ nothing himſelfe, whileſt he liued, yet when his backe was turned, and after his aſcenſion into heauen, the Apoſtles

did for him; by his appointment no doubt. Yet to S. Iohn in the Reu. the ſpirit ſaith directly, Scribe, write. Hee is bidden to write. And if no prophecy (S. Peter telling vs. 2. Pet. 1. 21.) came at any time by the will of man, but the men of God ſpake as they were lead by the Holy Ghoſt, then were not written prophecies neither meerely depending of the will of men, and of the election of the writers, but they did as men of God, that is ſeruants of God, homines

Some thinke Euangeliſtae are ſcriptores ſacri codicis; that the Euangeliſts there, are the pen-men of holy writ, and by that differ from others there mentioned. It is ſaid, dedit, Chriſt gaue them to the Church, therefore he ſet them on worke. For no man would take this honour to himſelfe, Heb. 5. No wiſe man at leaſt: not a leſſer then this, and therefore this much leſſe, to indite Scriptures, which is one of the greateſt of all.

               § 28. Now to Numb. 32. Of the Baptiſme of infants. Haue we no Scripture for that? Origen (you ſay) calls it an Apoſtolike tradition, Yea, he meanes, that at leaſt, though it bee of Scripture too. And there are ſcriptae traditiones, as your owne place teacheth you, 2. Theſſal. 2. Retinete traditiones, hold faſt the traditions, ſiue per ſermonem, ſiue per epiſtolam, whether by word, or by writing, commended to you. Therefore traditions might be both. S.

That is, I ſuppoſe, incident to one of the two kindes aforenamed, and in a word if it diſagreed from the

Doctrine of the Apoſtles.  We haue the figure of the Law,  with ſome aduantage on our ſide. There the knife, here the water.

Maruaile but ſome infants.  We haue Sinite parvulos venire ad me, a modell, and an idea of baptiſme, at the leaſt. For what doth Chriſt in baptiſme, but bleſſe them, and releaſe them from their ſinnes? For, hic eſt qui baptizat, it is Chriſt ſtill that baptizeth: and, Eph. 5. he cleanſeth the Church. If regnum coelorum belong to ſuch, why not baptiſme, which is the doore of the kingdome of heauen? If they be in foedere, why 4 1. Cor. 7. 14. not in teſſerâ?

                  Creſconius ſaith, that the determination of the Church is enough to ſtop the mouthes of ſuch clamorous hereticks, as the Donatiſts were, about their rebaptization, though Scripture were ſilent, becauſe the Church abhorreth it, yet prayer to Saints is of another nature, neither are you the Church, and much leſſe the Church, ſine vllâ ambiguitate, as he there ſpeakes, nor can you ſhew this deſcending of the practiſe of the church, from the firſt times, fili ductu, which was Auſtens triumph, to confound them with the Church, after he had conquered them with the Scriptures. Nay, in his ſecond booke againſt Creſconius, c. 31. he allowes ſuch a ſupremacie to holy Scriptures, that by direction of them, do caeteris literis fidelium (not onely infidelium) liberè iudicemus. We may freely

iudge of ought other writings, of faithfull men (therefore of Fathers themſelues) by collation of Scriptures. And, de vnit. Eccl. c. 16. Non dicimus nos nobis ideo credi oportere, quòd in Eccleſiâ Chriſti ſumus. [We ſay not, we muſt be credited, becauſe we are in the Church.]
               § 29. As for that other place of his, out of the 4. de baptiſm. cont. Denatiſt. cap. 24. What neither Councells haue determined, nor Scripture defined, &c. one part is for you, that no Councells haue decreed your prayers to Saints, no Scriptures ordained them, but in the other ye are farre ſhort, Quod vniuerſa tenet Eccleſia, whereas you ſhew nothing afore the fourth age.

               § 30. Numb. 33. Are Godfathers and Godmothers of the ſubſtance of baptiſme? And yet ſuppoſe they were, I hope there is a print of this very thing in Scripture. See Eſa. 8. v. 2. I tooke vnto me faithfull witneſſes, Vriah the Prieſt, and Zachariah the ſonne of Ieberechiah. This was at the naming of the ſonne of the Propheteſſe, Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz. But you anſwer your ſelfe by the words of the Canon, in the ſame number, that theſe rules are rules of doctrine, concerning

                  indifferent things. And is our ſtrife with you about ſuch?
               § 31. Mr. Rogers might well ſay, that we are not commanded by expreſſe tearmes to baptize infants. Yet warranted, as I haue ſhewed you, yea cōmanded, but not in expreſſe termes, which you would ſmother. Your fopperies are neither expreſſely, nor implicitely, Scripturall.
               § 32. To your 34. Numb. where you profeſſe to lay open a notable piece of trumpery, of the Biſhops of England, (for with ſuch reuerence you ſpeake, when you ſpeake of them all) I pray you ſee how notable. Firſt, the Canon neuer Can. qui ptiùs. ſaies expreſſely, nor by conſequence, that the Papiſts hold that the ſigne of the Croſſe is of the ſubſtance of the Sacrament. And yet herein you would faine obſerue a contradiction betweene his ROYALL MATESTIES gratious cenſure of you, acquiting you from that error, and the Conference at

words of the Canon, as they may ſeeme to glaunce at you for ſo holding. Such encouragement you giue his MOST EXCELLENT MAIESTIE, to make the beſt of your errors, to which his princely nature eaſily enclineth him, and more eaſily might, for the great benefit of Gods Church, and the compounding of diſcords, if you had the grace not to deprane him. But as I was ſaying; The Canon onely affirmes, that the ſigne of the Croſſe hath euer been accompanied, of late times, in the Church of England, with ſufficient cautions, and exceptions, againſt all popiſh ſuperſtition and error, and againe, That ſince the aboliſhing of Popery, the Church of England hath euer held and taught, that the ſigne of the Croſſe is no part of the ſubſtance of that Sacrament; and that the infant baptized, is, by vertue of baptiſme, receiued into the Congregation of Chriſts flocke, as a perfect member thereof, euen before it be ſigned with the ſigne of the Croſſe. Whereas all this while there may be other errors about the ſigne of the Croſſe, then holding it to be a part of the ſubſtance of Baptiſme. And from them we haue purged it. Bellarmine, I am ſure, de effectu ſacram: lib. 2. cap. 31. aſcribes ſpirituall vertue to this ceremony, and quotes to that ende, a number of authors, but wreſted, as his manner is. Yea hee would haue it to worke wholeſome effects ex opere operato. What thinke you of that? And how if Bellarmine either ſtraggle and wander, now, from your Church herein, or, conuince you to be vnworthy of his MAIESTIES milde cenſure, in attributing grace and power to this ſigne? Laſtly, though your Church neuer held any ſuch thing, that is, your congregatio

that which the Canon might refer vnto. Yea the fond perſwaſion of lay-Papiſts, calling for it as violently, and as importunely, as for the water in baptiſme, which hath been knowne in this land, (I will not ſay where, nor how lately) becauſe it is an error ſpringing from Popery, & foſtered in your boſomes, though not proclaimed by your Church, might well be accounted among the Popiſh errors, from which we haue refined the ſigne of the Croſſe, by neither aſcribing vertue to it, holines, grace, nor yet neceſſary obſeruation, but onely by way of obedience where the Canon appoints, and conueniencie withſtandeth not, for ſome aduertiſements ſake. Can you doubt that there are errors, and errors in Popery, about the ſigne of the Croſſe, beſides making it to be a part of the Sacramēt of baptiſme, that alleadge Nauarrus here, your grand Caſuiſt, affirming Manual. c. 22. num. 6. that if baptiſme be adminiſtred without the Croſſe, wee ought to ſupply it afterwards? whereas either baptiſme muſt then be renewed and readminiſtred to the party, which cannot be without horrible ſacriledge, Heb. 6. and Epheſ. 4. or the ſigning with the Croſſe there, is not the Croſſe in baptiſme, if it come ſo long after. But we treat of the Croſſe in Baptiſme, and that is it which hath miniſtred all the offence. Finally, you ſay, if the midwife baptize, then the child muſt be croſſed afterward. So that the midwife may baptize belike, not croſſe. A high point in your low Diuinity, vnles you will haue the midwife to baptize the vnborne, another worthy practiſe no doubt, and yet then they might croſſe too, one as well as the other, in aerem both, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes. 1.

But be you anſwered, That facere with the Biſhop, as with Moſes before, concerneth the maine action; not the ceremonie appertaining, and veſting, ſuch as praier to Saints cannot

               § 34. Num. 43. Beyond the degree of ridiculous. The Biſhop ſeemes to graunt, that to pray vnto Saints, is either good of it ſelfe, or at leaſt indifferent. Why ſo? For if it were abſolutely bad, ſaith he, it were in vaine to demaund a precept of it, which notwithſtanding he doth. What? and if he demaund of them, that thinke they doe well in ſo doing? Yet the Bedlam addes, So as either this his demaund is verie idle and abſurd, or elſe he muſt acknowledge it at leaſt to be indifferent, and conſequently no leſſe lawfull, then the Croſſe in Baptiſme. Time and paper, how are you caſt away?
               § 35. Num. 45. If we cannot pray to Saints without iniury to Chriſt, how doe we craue one anothers prayers here in earth? If of ſinners, why not of Saints? If of men, why not of Angels? Thus he. And why might Adoniah marry lower, and yet not match with Abiſhac his fathers concubine, without high treaſon?

Cor. 15. the offices are ſuperfluous that tend thereunto, and all reference to the glorified ſpirits, ſo complete of themſelues, that wee cannot requite their fauours with the like, is conſtrued to be preiudiciall to our common King. By which we anſwer alſo to your retortion of the Biſhops text, in your numb. 47. Is the deſiring the prayers of liuing Saints, as much as Venite ad me? Doe not they come to vs, as well as we to them in this ſort? 
                     Ʋenite ad me therefore, is a farre other matter, and to bee ſhunned towards Angels, towards heauenly Saints; not ſo the borrowing of aide, the imploring of help

of men, and pilgrimes, ſuch as our ſelues are.
               § 36. Numb. 49. You acknowledge like a man, that Chriſt is our onely Mediatour by way of prayer, as well as of redemption. Accedens per ſemetipſum, Heb. 7. and many ſuch like. Hold you to that then. Your foote ſtands right if you can keepe it ſo. And when S. Iohn ſaith, whome you alſo quote, 1. Ioh. 2. We haue an aduocate, and he is the propitiation: doth he not ſhewe that propitiation goes to make an aduocate? So, Vnus eſt Mediator, but, qui dedit ſe pro omnibus, that is, by redemption, 1. Tim. 2. they goe ſtill together. Now the Angels are not for the one: therefore, not for the other.
               § 37 You anſwer vs, as you thinke, Num. 52. That the Angels are not excluded as Mediators to God for vs, but that by way of Chriſts merits they may mediate well enough: and ſo you conſtrue that of Auſten, contra Epiſt. Parmen. cap. 8. lib. 2. that onely Chriſt prayes for all, he whets the prayers that others offer for vs. But what are Chriſts merits to the Angels, good Sir? what intereſt haue they in them? Doe you thinke they were directed to the vſe of Angels, that they ſhould lay hold on them? And if not ſo, with what confidence ſhall they pray to God through them? how ſhal they deſire to be heard of God, whether they pray for vs or for themſelues, (for that skils not) by the merits of Chriſt, as you fancie? We haue heard that prayer preſuppoſeth faith. Shall the Angels repoſe truſt in the merits of Chriſt, which belong not to them? So are you toſſed in your vanity, like a boate in a ſtorme, that you forget the verie principles of Chriſtian relligion, namely, that Chriſt neuer tooke the Angels vpon him, but the ſeed of Abraham, Heb. 2. and for vs hee ſuffered, not for them; and by him, not by them, are we to be brought to God, as Theodoret, as Chryſoſt. as Theophylact,

                     It is to bee noted, that notwithſtanding this clauſe, per Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum, the Papiſts haue other prayers to Saints in which there is no ſuch. Which Greg. de Val. beeing to anſwer to, hath no refuge but this; Quaererem ab ijs qui tantâ diligentiā eiuſmodi praecandi formulas in obſoletis & corroſis voluminibus venantur, our illis magis qu

                  noſtrum, adiuring belike the Saint, to be gratious vnto vs for Chriſts ſake, (for what els is the meaning of that clauſe?) As if Chriſt were now our Mediatour to the Saint, not the Saint to Chriſt. So are you gyddied and hurled vp and downe, with euery blaſt of vaine doctrine, euerie puffe of temeritie. The like I read in Maffaeus his life of Ignatius the Ieſuite-maker, lib. 2. c. 5. that God the Father commended the Ieſuites to his Sonne, whom the Scripture ſpeakes of as our commender to the Father, and no otherwiſe. A voice was heard from heauen, ſaying to Salmeron, and Laynez, and thoſe good fellowes, Ego vos commendaui, or conciliaui, filio meo. Theſe were the trances, and the windlaces of the firſt Ieſuites.
               
               § 39. But leaſt you thinke, you can wreſt that club of S. Auſten, contra Epiſt. Parmen. before quoted, out of the Biſhops hands, viz. that Chriſt is hee alone, pro quo nemo interpellat, ſed ipſe pro omnibus, for whome no bodie makes requeſt, but he for all; you may pleaſe to conſider, that if this be ſo, then muſt the Angels of force giue ouer beeing Mediatours. For if they mediate at all, they muſt mediate for all, and none for them, which, S. Auſten ſaith, is proper to Chriſt. None for them, becauſe they are in no want, as other folkes are, all teares beeing wiped from their eyes, or rather neuer any teare hauing bedewed their cheekes. Againe, they for all; becauſe burning with charitie, they neglect none, but compaſſionate the cauſe of all them that are in diſtreſſe. And from hence it will follow, that either Chriſt muſt needes giue ouer this ſpecialtie, which S. Auſten inueſts him with, or the Angels their mediation. Doe you ſee now, how fitly the Biſhop vrgeth this place againſt you, and how you haue inuerted that of Daniel, in ſtead of millia millium miniſtrabant ei, ſetting vp ſo many Angels, qui depraedentur eum, to ſupplant God, and robbe him of his honour?
               
                  
§ 40. But let vs heare you out of Daniel, what you alleadge for your ſelfe. Num. 57. out of Dan. 3. that militant Chriſtians fare the better, for the prayers of the Saints in glorie, becauſe Daniel belike vrgeth God, with his promiſe, to Abraham, and Iſaac, &c. This I finde not in the 3. of Dan. and the queſtion is not, whether Saints benefit vs, or no, but whether we may pray to them. In this place Daniel onely mentions them to God, but makes no petition to them himſelfe. Yet becauſe it is a phraſe that occurres in Scripture, and may ſtumble the heedeleſſe, I anſwer briefly. For Abraham, and Iſaac, and Iſraels ſake, that is, not for the merits of the men, as you conſtrue it, whereas they neuer entreated by their owne merits, much leſſe others by theirs: (ſee Dan. 9. 8.) but for the tenure of Gods promiſe, running vpon Abraham, vpon Iſaac, and their ſeede. So our Sauiour in S. Iohn, Adhuc nihil rogâſtis in nomine meo; As yet you haue asked nothing in my name. In my name, that is, in expreſſe knowledge of me, ſince I was reuealed to the world. For, Deus Abraham, & Iſaac, was then all in all. Henceforth we pray, per Chriſtum Dominum, or per Chriſtum filium, and obtaine our ſuit in that forme of ſtyle. As was propheſied long before, Pſal. 60. 16. Adorabunt per eum, they ſhall worſhip by him, or pray by him, which then was not performed, now is. Howbeit Origen not amiſſe, puts them both together, hom. 7. in Ezech. vpon thoſe words, Incenſum meum poſuiſtis ante faciem eorum, that is, idolorum; and, incenſum, ſaies he, is Orationes ſanctorum, out of the Apocal. Incenſe is prayer. Si ergo inſtituti ad Orationem, cum illam Deo debeamus offerre, Deo Abraham, Deo Iſaac, Deo Iacob, & Patri Ieſu Chriſti, ijs offerimus quae ipſi confinximus, in tantum vt idolis incenſum Dei proponamus, &c. that is, [If therefore whereas we are taught and trained how to pray, we when as we ſhould offer our praiers to God, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, the God of Iacob, and the Father of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall offer them to ſuch things as our ſelues haue deuiſed, inſomuch as we ſet the incenſe of God before idolls, &c.] Note here three things.  Firſt, prayer is Gods incenſe, 

as belonging to God onely. Incenſum Dei eſt oratio. And to that we are trained, nurtured, and taught. Inſtituti ad hoc. And what elſe ſaies Origen? Quòd debeamus orationem Deo offerre: that we muſt offer our praiers to God; not ante faciem eorum, not to others.  Secondly, he that offers it  to any but God, offers it to idolls: quae confinximus ipſi, which our ſelues haue deuiſed. Vnleſſe we haue warrant for ſo doing; but warrant we haue none, God neither giuing vs, nor meaning to giue vs any. As Tiberius forbad the Romanes, Dio in Tiberio. to erect any Temple or image to him, Niſi ego permittam: adding immediatly, Atqui ego non permittam: [that is, vnleſſe I licence you: now I neuer meane to licence you.] You are Idolaters therefore, you cannot auoide it, though they bee Saints that you pray to, vnleſſe you can ſhewe a reuocation of Gods minde in this behalfe vnder his owne hand.  Thirdly,  the coniunction of Deus Abraham, with Pater Chriſti, the new Teſtament with the old. Though now the former of theſe two, reſolues into the latter; the God of Abraham into the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in whome alone we muſt put our truſt, concerning the graunting of our praiers. Your ſelues doe not much mention Abraham amongſt the Saints, nor Iſaac, nor Iacob, which ſhewes their names were not put for meritorious, but onely formall, or legall, as vpon whom went the promiſe, which now in Chriſt alone is yea and amen, that is, perfectly perfect.
               § 41. To returne to your method. So for Dauids ſake, 1. King. 11. God abated his wrath towards Salomon, you ſay. But Salomon neuer prayed to his Father Dauid, in ſuch a manner, after he was dead. How then? God hauing promiſed in Dauids life time, that he would 
                     So 2. King. 13. 23. thus we read (which cleeres this point) And the Lord was grations vnto them, and had compaſſion on them, and had reſpect vnto them, becauſe of HIS COVENANT with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, &c. not deſtroy his children, though they tranſgreſſed his Lawes, but onely chaſtice them with the ſcourge of men, verifies this vpon Salomon now, by force of his promiſe ſo made to Dauid. What gather ye from hence? Is it not lawfull to vrge God with his promiſe, vnleſſe we pray to the

Saints? As for Dauids diuinitie, it was cleane otherwiſe. No man may deliuer his brothers ſoule, Pſal. 49. and Pſal. 6. In inferno quis confitebitur tibi? Beſides that, Chriſt is often called Dauid, in the old Teſtament: as, Suſcitabo eis Dauid Regem ipſorum, Ierem. 30. id eſt, Chriſtum, ſaith Theodoret vpon that place; and, the holy things of Dauid, Act. 13. And the Keyes of Dauid, Apocal. 3. 7. who is that but Chriſt?
               § 42. Moſes, and Paul, their ſauing diuers hundreths, or one of them hundred thouſands, by their interceſſions, in their life time; neither argues their particular interceſſion for vs, now they are dead, (ſervierunt enim ſaeculo ſuo to ſpeake with S. Peter) and much leſſe the lawfulnes of our recourſe to them. The like of Iob, of others that you bring, may be ſaid. Baruch, me thinkes, properly, Bar. 4. 21. Clamabo ad altiſſimum in diebus meis, I will crie to the moſt high, in my dayes, that is, whiles I liue. Meaning, he ſhould haue no place of doing ſo after death. As S. Peter ſaies of preaching, 2. Pet. 1. 13. and S. Paul alſo, Phil. 1. 23. who elſe needed not to haue been in a ſtrayte, if after death he might haue ſuccoured his people.
               § 43. In your 59. Num. you bewray your ſelfe. The ability of Saints to help men (ſay you) is to be aſcribed not onely to the effect of their prayers, but alſo to their power, authority, and dignity. You fly then to the Saints, as to the giuers of thoſe things (out of their power and authority) which you aske in prayer, not onely as ſuters to God for them in your behalfe. What more groſſe idolatry can there be then this? Is not this that, that you were wont to diſclaime? Where is now per Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum?
               
               § 44. Well; Num. 61. hauing talked your pleaſure of the practiſe of Chriſts Church, of the conſent of antiquity, of the cuſtome of all ages, &c. at laſt you bethinke your ſelfe, how all this will goe for currant, when you ſhall come to a reckoning. The Biſhop ſay you, will oppoſe to this effect, that the authorities brought, faile both in time, as being

later by 300 yeares, then the challenge was, and in vniforme conſent, for others alſo muſt be heard to ſpeake as well as they, if any thing will be done. Yet you comfort your ſelfe thus, that his MAIESTIE profeſſeth to reuerence the Fathers, more then euer the Ieſuites did, and yet they reuerence them all, after the three firſt, to many ages downward. Who doubts but his MAIESTIE reuerences the Fathers, both for infinite good that may be gotten by the reading of them, and namely towards the diſcerning of the truth of points, euen now controuerted in relligion, though ſtill with ſubmiſſion of his iudgement to holy Scripture, and alſo reuerenceth them more by much then the Ieſuits doe, though the Ieſuits happily reuerence more fathers then he? For what pedaneous author haue not they made a father of? Ye may ſay with him, cōſidering their falſifications in this kinde, Mutauit calceos, pater conſcriptus repentè factus eſt. 
                  Cic. Philipp. Nay, now euerie Ieſuite is a Father at firſt daſh, whether 
                     R. P. the Ieſuits ſtyle. he write or no. And though his MAIESTIE hath diſpenſed ſo much with his height, as by writing his Apology to encounter with them that are no Kings, yet he will neuer be tried by them that are no Fathers. And therefore you gueſſe well, when you thinke you ſhall bee forced to looke farther backeward, then you haue done yet, if you well euict any thing. It is true alſo, that the Biſhop ſaies, (although it anger you) of the Cardinall, that hee hath done nothing in his Apologie, in doing no more then ſo. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , he had as good made no Apologie at all. By the way it is pretty, and worth the noting, how you report the Biſhops words, Rex expectat in quadringentis annis, &c. though de quadringentis would haue fitted you better; which you quote in the margent, as the Biſhops owne words, and like enough to be ſo; not, in quadringentis. But this is your Latine, when you liſt to ſpeake like your ſelfe, and reforme Biſhops for theirs. If it be true, as you ſay, that the Fathers of the three firſt hundred yeares after Chriſt, are ſo few and ſo ſcantie remaining to our daies, (you reckon but 7. or 8.

though, I ſuppoſe, there are diuers more) yet what ill luck haue you with them, that can finde no footing of all your new-fangled ſuperſtition, in any of their workes? Not in Tertullian, not in Origen, not in Irena, Ignace, Lactance, Melito, Cyprian, Iuſtine, Clemens, Arnobius, Methodius, Minutius, the Cyrills, Dionyſius, Athenagoras, Theophilus, &c. not in Euſebius himſelfe, who liued there anewſt, and enclined to the Platonicks, as did ſome others of the forenamed ranke. Which Platonicks are thought to be ſomewhat fauourable to your fancie of worſhipping Saints, aboue the reſt of the Philoſophers. And if the Fathers, as you ſay, write ſo few in an age, does not this ſhew that the ſquare of our faith is the Scripture, not the Fathers? for how if the Fathers had wrote nothing at all? As, of diuerſe points, you confeſſe your ſelfe, they did not, Num. 63. and, Num. 66. And in the beginning of this Chapter, you would make vs beleeue, that the Apoſtles themſelues had no commaundement for writing. Might not the Fathers pennes much more haue ſtood ſtill? Yet you adde that the after-ages abounded with writers, when perſecution ceaſed, and many worthy Volumes were ſpread abroad into the world. It may well bee; but as hereſie is confounded many times by writing, ſo ſome errours will creepe in withall, and hardly can it be eſchewed. Abundabit ſcientia, but abundabit iniquitas too. Daniel the one, our Sauiour Chriſt the other, each of the ſame times of the world, & of the Church. The Elephant oppreſſeth Eleazar in the fall. So falſhood gets ſome ground of truth, euen in ſeeming to be foyled. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Wherein, I may boldly ſay, that truth of relligion comes in as much hazard to bee loſt, as our Sauiour was in the crowde, and concourſe at Ieruſalem. As in the ouerflowes of Nilus, the corne feilds are the better, and the fatter for it, but ſerpents and Crocodyles come in amaine; ſo whiles many pennes walke, the originall

puritie is leſſe preſerued. It will be alwayes true which Tully ſaith, Quò propiùs aberant à diuina progenie, &c. (ſo from the Primitiue times) eò acutiùs, cautiùſ

               § 45. When you aske, if we would not receiue the ſigne of the Croſſe, as proceeding from antiquitie, vnles all the Fathers had ſtood for it, why ſhould we hold you long in ſuſpence? It is the vniforme conſent of the godly Fathers, that endeares the vſe of that memorial to vs, and had onely certaine ſingulars, like ſtarres in a darke night, deliuered their opinion of it, it ſhould neuer haue found ſuch entertainment at our hands, for the antiquities ſake. And therefore you muſt muſter a ſquadron of Fathers (though I ſee it be troubleſome vnto you) for prayer to Saints: not come in with your ſnatches, and your 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , here and there, if you will carrie it by the Fathers. Where it may pleaſe you, to remember, that in the Conference at Hampton Court, which you quoted ſo lately, the Biſhop that you now write againſt, brought Tertullian for the Croſſe, and the vſe therof in baptiſme, in immortali lauacro; you haue neither author, for Inuocation of Saints ſo auncient, nor piece of an author. Yet you compare this with the ſigne of the croſſe. How vnfitly?
               § 46. The Biſhops, (you ſay) are giuen to teach the Church; if they may erre therein, the Church may be deceiued, and ſo all is marred.

                  . Auſten doth not tell you of erring Biſhops, of deceiuing Biſhops, which the people fondly relyed vpon, he in vaine recalling them, and denouncing that the Biſhops authority is no ſanctuary to the erroneous. See lib. de paſtor. cap. 10. Saepe hoc dicunt heretici, ſecuri ſequimur Epiſcopos. The heretikes haue this often in their mouthes, 
                        〈◊〉
                      are ſafe ſo long as we follow our Biſhops.
                  
It is a ſigne of hereſie, with S. Auſten, to follow the Biſhops, and their iudgement, ſecurely, viz. without looking any further. And in the 7. Chapter of the ſaid booke, hee applyes that to the Biſhops of his time out of Ezek. 34. Quod errabat non reuocaſtis, the wandring ſheepe ye haue not called backe. What remedy are the Biſhops now againſt error? And, Si Epiſcopus conſtitutus in eccleſia catholica non bonam rationem reddit de oue, quam non quaeſierit errantem de grege Dei, qualem rationem redditurus eſt haereticus (viz. Epiſcopus) qui non ſolùm non reuocauit ab errore, ſed etiam impulit in errorem? Doe you ſee, that Biſhops doe not onely not bring from errour, but lead into error, yea thruſt, impell? cap. 10. of the aforeſaid. And yet you thinke, the onely antidote of Church errors, lyes in the Biſhops. How much better, S. Peter, Habemus firmiorem ſermonem propheticum? We haue a ſurer teſtimony, namely the holy Scripture, not onely then the authority of any Biſhops can be to preſerue from error, but then a voyce from heauen, (for of that ſpeaks S. Peter) which Satan may counterfeit, and ſo likewiſe fayne himſelfe a Biſhop, as well as change himſelfe into an Angel of light. Therefore S. Hilary ſaies, that Chriſt would not 
                     Hilar. in Matth. can. 16. let his Diſciples beare witnes of him, (and yet no meane perſons) becauſe he was to be approoued by other manner of witneſſes, namely the Law and the Prophets, that is, the Scriptures. And S. Chryſoſtome, Hom. 9. in cap. 3. ad Coloſſ. Exhorting the lay-men to prouide them bookes, the medicines

                  of their ſoules, as he calls them, bids them 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  not to tarrie for another Maſter (not the Prelate himſelfe) 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , for he hides many things, many times, from them, for enuie, or for vain-glory. Whereas the Scripture layes all open ſincerely. Is this a ſmall prerogatiue of Scriptures aboue the Doctors? S. Auſten alſo cap. 11. of the booke aforequoted, after he had lodg'd his ſheepe, like a good paſtor, in the mountaines of Iſrael, that is, as he interprets it, in the authority of the diuine Scriptures, he thus beſpeakes

them. Ibi paſcite, vt ſecurè paſcatis. Quicquid inde 
                  Chriſt loſt his head (or his life) onely to fulfill the Scrip. [So as Script. is preferred by Chriſt himſelfe, both before his head and his body.] Heman Matth. 84. 
                  audieritis, hoc vobis bene ſapiat, quicquid extra eſt, reſpuite. And againe, Audite vocem paſtoris, colligite vos ad montes Scripturae ſanctae. No doubt, theſe are the mountaines that our Sauiour bids vs flie vnto, vnder Antichriſts perſecution, that is, yours. Ibi ſunt deliciae cordis veſtri, (addes S. Auſten) ibi nihil venenoſum, nihil alienum. And laſtly, when he hath ſhut them into that ſheepcoat, and pend them vp in that fold, for he vrgeth the word, [Erunt ſtabula earum illic,] he giues them Stabula earum illic. Ezech. 34. leaue to triumph, and ſay in this wiſe: Bene eſt, verum eſt, manifeſtum eſt, non fallimur. This he calls, requieſcere in ſtabulis illic, to rely vpon Scripture, not vpon the Biſhops authoritie. Now it is well with vs, now we are right, now the caſe is plaine, now we are not deceiued, when the Scripture firſt ſaies it. What ſhould I tell you here either of Cyprians licenſing the people of God, Ne ſibi plebi blandiatur, quaſi immunis à contagione delicto eſſe poſſit, cum ſacerdote peccatore communicans, & ad iniuſtum atque illicitum praepoſiti ſui Epiſcopatum, conſenſum ſuum accommodans, cum per Oſeam deus doceat omnes omnino ad peccatum conſtringi, qui fuerint profuni & iniuſti ſacerdotis ſacrificio cotaminati. the flocke of Chriſt, to renounce their wicked Biſhop, not partake with his ſeruices, lib. 1. Ep. 4. or of the third Canon of that famous Councell of Epheſus, which enioynes thus, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The Councell giues charge, Not to ſubmit to the authoritie of any backe-ſlided Biſhops, or Biſhops departed, that is departed from the truth. There may bee Apoſtaticall Biſhops then, departers from the truth, (had you no ſuch Popes? aske Lyra, aske Genebrard) and Apoſtatare à ſide, Lyr. in Matt. Apoſtatici, ſaltem apotaſtici, PP. Geneb.

Which you may doe well to take heed of, in the preſent queſtion, of praying to Saints, if any paſſion from a multitude, or a ſingle Chriſtian, hath drawne forth a vowe, a prayer, or ſuch like, if any ſuddaine motion hath tranſported further then ſhould, yet to beware how you make an article of it.
               § 47. As for that you ſay, the Fathers whome you quote about this point, were agents in the Councells, which the King and the Biſhop profeſſe to reuerenee; it is one thing what the Fathers ſay in ſeuerall, as it were ſolitarij in tecto, another when they meet Synodically in a Councell. Is there no grace belonging to Councells? Why is it not ſaid then, vbi vnus, but, vbi duo aut tres in nomine meo, naming the firſt multitudes, to ſhew the vertue of an aſſembly, where farre more meet then two or three? You haue firſt no Councells, for your ſupplication to Saints; for miſerable are your proofes of Flauianus and Proterius: they haue toucht the Diamond, but they cannot draw like the Diamond, they are

Neither againe haue you all the Fathers, no not of one whole age among the fiue, no not of the later and weaker in authority, neerer the bottom, and thoſe that you haue they write diſperſedly, neuer ſo much as ioyned in domeſticall conference, which is a great derogation in regard of the credit that goes with lawfull Synods, although leſſe generall. And laſtly though you neuer lyn vaunting, and prating, what you haue produced out of the Fathers, as if it were ſo peremptory, yet wee hauing examined and peruſed them before, finde not one of them to depoſe ſo pregnantly on your ſide, but that he may be avoided. If the ſtreame of the Fathers, not onely of one age, as you idly crake, but ſundry ages together could preuaile any thing with you, you would neuer haue defined ſo proudly and

with his legion of Fathers) nor giuen ſentence againſt the Dominican for the Franciſcan. As for the place to the Epheſ. which you quote, to ſhew that God hath placed Paſtors in the Church, to defend it from errour, Dedit quoſdam paſtores, &c. Eph. 4. It is by way of induſtrie, in diſpenſing Gods word, not of infallibilitie, that they cannot poſſibly erre. Where viſion ceaſes, though the Paſtors be neuer ſo many, yet the people periſh; yea, many Paſtors are the cauſe, ſaith God, why my vine is deſtroyed. I made indeede my Couenant with Levi, and, the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerue knowledge, Mal. 2. but the Prieſts oft times depart out of the way, and they cauſe many to ſtūble in the Law; IN THE LAVV, ſaith God, by miſinterpreting it, no doubt; they haue corrupted the Couenant of Levi, ſaith the Lord of hoaſts.

It is not ſaid, if the light be darkned, to ſhew that Prelates cannot faile in truth of Doctrine. This he. Why then does he call the Pope, Sal ſalium, in the ſame place? Is it becauſe his manners cannot be tainted neither? Or, why does he ſay, that Praelatus ſatuus mittendus eſt foras? Shall the Pope be depoſed for euill life? It is not the faſhion. Or laſtly, why does he argue from, In quo ſalietur? co prooue that the Pope hath no ſuperiour to ſalt him, and therfore concludes, that he cannot turne fooliſh, becauſe Chriſt (ſaies he) left nothing without remedie. Is not the dunghill his remedie? And yet in another place, he allowes the Pope to be Pope, though his light turne darknes, as well as his ſalt follie.

               § 48 But S. Auſten, you ſay, thought the teſtimonie of ſixe Biſhops, ſufficient to conuince Iulian the Pelagian about originall ſinne, and the baptiſme of young infants. He meanes ſufficient to tame Iulians pride, and haughtie humor, after he had laid

him on his backe, with Scripture-arguments, which is not all one with deciding the queſtion by the Fathers authoritie. Iulian had called Originall ſinne, Manichaiſmum. S. Auſten alleadges thoſe Fathers for it, that were knowne to be no Manichees. It

The Fathers and all come in at the triumph, like thoſe that waited on our Sauiour into Hieruſalem, but it is the Scripture that ſtrikes the ſtroke. Neither doth S. Auſten miſlike that ſaying of Iulian, l. 1. c. 7. that Scripturarum authoritas, goes before eruditio Sanctorum. In the eſtabliſhing of a truth, the authoritie of Scripture, goes before the learning of holy men. Qui tamen ſancti non authoritatem veritati ſuo tribuêre conſenſu, ſed teſtimonium & gloriam de ei

As for the baptiſme of infants, I haue ſpoken before. And Iulian himſelfe was baptized in his infancie, as S. Auſten tells him, l. 1. c. 4. What compaſſe will hold the authorities of Scripture, that proclaime our infection from the very wombe? Iob ſaith, the infant of one night is not cleane, &c. Nay, he would neuer haue curſed the day of his birth, c. 3. but that he was borne in ſinne. For nothing can ſubiect a man to the curſe, but ſinne. The Pſalme ſaith, Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquitie, and made warme in my mothers ſinnes. Againe, The vngodly are froward from the wombe.

God forbid. And infinite the like, throughout all the old Teſtament. Beſides diuers other proofes out of Salomons Proverbs, he would neuer haue ſaid, that the day of death is better then the day of birth, but that we are borne in ſinne, and neuer ſet free from this graue iugum, of the ſonnes of Adam, as another calls it, till our very death. It is primum vivens, 
                  Eccleſiaſt. 
                  & vltimum moriens. But my purpoſe was not to recken vp places of Scripture, for confirmation of Originall ſinne, though you ſee how farre your prouocation carrieth me, that ſay, that this could not be prooued againſt young Iulian, but by the Fathers. If I ſhould ſpeake of the new Teſtament, what ende would there be? I will name but one place (omitting 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Eph. 4. and, Eramus quondam, Tit. 3. and many the like) namely, that which S. Auſt. choaks the gallant with, after he had ruffled in his rhetorike, and ſo ſpruſely vrged him to ſhew but a crannie, or a little hole, by which this originall ſinne hath crept into the world. Oſtendo tibi, ſaith S. Auſten, non anguſtam rimam, ſed latiſſimam ianuam, IN QVO OMNES PECCAVERVNT. Rom. 5. Looke you, Sir, (ſaith S. Auſt.) not a litle hole; but a broad gate that I ſhew you, or rather the Apoſtle ſheweth you, by which ſin entred into the world; viz. the firſt man, in whoſe fall we were bruiſed, as the Platonikes are wont to ſay of the wing of the ſoule, and they alluding perhappes hether. So notorious is the originall corruption of mankinde, that ſenſe gropes it, and nature feeles it, and the world complaines of it, that though the Scriptures did not teſtifie it, the Fathers need not be cited, where the Platoniks proclaime it. As for S. Auſtens iudgement of Councells, where the lis is dependens, and Scripture hath been produced as yet on neither ſide, that one ſaying of his is ſufficient, to ſhew the inſufficiencie of

them, which is extant in his booke againſt Maximinus the Arrian, l. 3. c. 14. Nec ego tibi Nicenum, nec tu mihi Ariminenſe debes concilium obijcere. He remits his aduerſary the Nicene Councell, rather then he will ſtand to any tryall but Scriptures, about a point of faith. In which Nicene there were more then ſixe Fathers, which you talke of here; no leſſe then 318. if you remember.
               § 49. And is not that goodly proofe now, for inuocation of Saints, that it hath been beneficiall to the world, and graced with miracles, &c? As if it were for nothing, that the ſpirit ſaith, Si ſurrexerit in medio tui propheta, yea and etiamſi 
                  Deut. 13. 1. &c. 
                  euenerit ſecundum verbum eius, although it come to paſſe according to his word. For God doth all this to try vs. A ſhipman is ſeen ſaith Pliny, in a tempeſt, when the cables are ſtretcht, when the winds beat, the waters ſwell, cum gemit arbor, when the ſhip-board groanes, yea when the blood commeth out at the marryners fingers ends.

Yea, not onely Angels, but Chriſt himſelfe, if he be counterfeited, is to be reiected, Ecce hîc, & ecce illic, as in the Cooke Cartoſus, in the zeale of the multitudes madde vpon Mamas, and the like.

Sanct. lib. 1. cap. 20. and refutes not the anſwer that he there makes to our mens obiections, about praying to Saints, therefore he is guilty of wilfull malice, and goes againſt his conſcience, in not taking away the ſolutions, as there they ſtand. As if the Biſhop lackt worke for ſooth, or his taske had been to refute the Cardinalls Controuerſies, and not the Apology onely. With ſuch crimes you patch vp, when you lacke matter.
               § 52. You thinke much, that the Biſhop calls you to ſuch authors, as Origen againſt Celſus, as Athanaſius, and Cyrill, and the like Fathers, auncienter then thoſe that you delight in, by which time a leake was made in relligion; and corruption, (which can hardly be kept out for a hundred yeares, as Luther was wont to ſay) in proceſſe of time had gotten no ſmall aduantage.

                  Polycrates Biſhop of Epheſus, his ſpeach is very obſeruable, concerning the Church, that being left as a chaſt virgine, & ſpouſe of Chriſt, to the Apoſtles tuition, they indeed kept her ſo, but ſo did not they that came after, but ſtained that praiſe of hers by ſundry deuiſes of their owne bringing in, which was a thing that S. Paul feared in his owne life time, about the Church of Corinth, 2. Cor. 11. 2. 3. leaſt Satan had played the wily ſerpent with them, and ſeduced them from the original ſimplicity of Chriſt, which they once enioyed. In Origen and the aforenamed Authors, we finde no ſuch Diuinitie, as praying to Saints, though much occaſion was giuen them not to haue diſſembled it, if any ſuch had been. As when with their conformitie, they might haue gained the heathen, by

enclining to them, which is a thing that Euſebius hunteth De praep. Euan. lib. 12. & 13. after not a little, to paralell vs together. Origen refuteth the argument drawne from Courtly mediations, as Ambroſe after him; and though he whiſper as if the Saints ſpake certaine good words for vs after they are in heauen, yet he makes it no conſequent that we ſhould pray to them, nay he ſaith, as iealous of his owne iudgement, in Epiſt. ad Rom. lib. 2. Maneatinter occulta, 
                  Item in Cant. hom. 3. Non erit inconueniens ſic putare. In Ioſ. c. 3. Ego ſic arbitror. And, Audiui quendam ita dicentem. This is great certaintie, no doubt. So Euſeb. of Potamiaena, lib. 6. c. 5. that vndertooke to intercede for Baſilides after her death: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  nec chartis committatur, [Let it remaine as ſecret, and not be deliuered in writing,] acknowledging it Apocryphall, and not Canonicall doctrine, by the very tenure of his words. And this he ſpeaks of their praying for vs: not acknowledging ſo much as the Biſhop graunts, (as you often tell vs) though when that is graunted, that they pray for vs, it followes not that we muſt pray to them. See Origen contr. Celſum lib. 8. at large. One time he reiects Celſus his Popiſh inference, that God is not diſpleaſed with ſuch inferiour patrones, as the Angels, and ſpirits, to mediate for vs. He graunts that the Angels are Gods Miniſters indeed, and his honourable friends, but he ſaith, that when God is made our friend, all his friends are ſtraight at friendſhip with vs. And becauſe the places are many, I will relate them in order, beginning with the firſt, though alleadging many, I may ſeeme to leaue out more. He begins his aforeſaid booke then, viz. the eight againſt Celſus, with praying to Chriſt, and to Chriſt onely, to be his good speed. Octavum aggreſſurus volumen, precor Deum & verbum eius vnigenitum: the rather to confute Celſus his praying to ſundry demy-gods, which in the proces he challengeth him for more openly. Iam
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ad ſequentem Celſi contextum pergendum eſt, vbi ſcitatur, quâ de cauſâ grauemur daemonas colere. That is, [And now we muſt proceed to Celſus his next words, wherin he askes, why we ſhould beloath to worſhip Angels.]

And when we ſay, Impoſſibile eſt pluribus Dominis ſimul ſeruire, [It is impoſſible to ſerue more then one Maſter:] Celſus reiects this, which neuertheleſſe was our Sauiours rule at firſt, and agrees verie well with our worſhipping the holy Trinitie, wherein there is but one Dominus, but one Lord or Maſter, though diſtinguiſhed into many perſons; and excludes all dependance vpon Saints and Angels, for ſo much as they are not intereſſed in the myſterie of the Trinitie, how glorious otherwiſe ſoeuer. Celſus proceedes. Qui enim plures deos venerantur, hoc ipſo rē gratam faciunt ſummo Deo, quòd nemini honor contingat niſi quem ille honorari vult. Quapropter qui veneratur eius ſubditos, non offendit illum, cuius omnes ſunt: that is, [For he that worſhips many gods, does good ſeruice therin to the ſupreame God, becauſe he honours none but whome he would haue to be honoured. And therefore he that honours his ſubiects, doth in no wiſe offend him whoſe ſubiects we are all.] But by this reaſon, we were to honour all men in the world, becauſe they are all Gods ſubiects. In the meane time, this defence of Celſus. his idolatrie, is the very ſame with the Papiſts, who are not aſhamed 
                     Coſter. Enchir. de venerat. Sanct. to ſay, that we muſt honour God for his owne ſake, and the Saints for Gods ſake. It followes in Origen. Nobis autem vnus Deus Pater, ex quo omnia. That is, But we haue one God the Father, to our Father, of whom are all things. This NOBIS, ſaith he, he speakes of himſelfe, and all that haue aſcended to the God of Gods, as I told you before out of the booke of the Canticles, according to S. Bernards expoſition, Paululum cum pertranſiſſem
                        •
                     , &c. Aſcendit autem in ſummum Deum is, qui eum inſeparabiliter & indiuiſibiliter colit per Ieſum Dei filium, cuius ſolius ductu pervenitur ad patrem, per cuius verbi ac ſapientiae contemplationem, modis omnibus conciliamur Deo conditori omnium. That is, [Nowe he aſcends to the God of We approach by Chriſt to worſhip the Father, becauſe by him we are reconciled to the Father. Gods (fleeing ouer other petty gods) who inſeparably and vndiuidedly worſhips him, through Ieſus the Sonne of God, by whoſe conduct alone we approach to the Father; by the conſideration of whoſe word and wiſedome, we are

euery way reconciled to God the maker of al things.] And a little after, Laudat creaturam bene
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ei precatur: He praiſes the creature (but that is all) and wiſhes well to it, (not precatur ſibi ab eâ, not prayes vnto it,) nec diſtrahitur ipſe à Deo, vt liud colat ſimul cum eo, nec ſuſtinet ſeruire duobus Dominis. That is, [Neither is he rent a pieces from God, to worſhip ſome other thing with him, neither does he endure to ſerue many Lords or Maſters.] Then, Non eſt igitur ſeditioſa vox ſic ſentientium, & nolentium ſeruire dominis pluribus, contentorum vno Domino Ieſu Chriſto. Celſus had called this a ſeditious ſpeech, to worſhip none but God, neither Saints, nor Angells, &c. Therefore Origen anſwers him; [And this is no ſeditious ſpeech of them that are thus minded, and that refuſe to ſerue many Maſters, being content with the Lord Ieſus Chriſt alone.] Cui ſeruientes erudiuntur ab eo, vt eruditi reddantur digni regno Dei & patris, &c. Whome they which ſerue, are inſtructed of him, that beeing ſufficiently learned, 
                  Chriſt a ſufficient bringer to the Father, becauſe a ſufficient teacher of him. 
                  they may become fit or worthy of the Kingdome of God, and the Father, &c. Chriſt, you ſee, is able to bring to heauen the worſhippers of him, though they worſhip none beſides him. Nec ideo cauemus ne cui praeter Deum ſeruiamus, ne laedatur Deus, ſicut home laeditur, ſi ſeruus eius ſeruiat alteri: ſed ideo illi ſeruimus ne nos ipſi laedamur, ſeparantes nos a portione Dei, &c. Celſus belike had ſaid, that God was not hurt, though more were ſerued beſides him, as men thinke themſelues hurt, when their ſeruants ſerue any other beſides themſelues. But wee are loath, ſaies Origen, to hurt our ſelues, rending and ſeparating vs from the inheritance of God, if wee looke to any other then God alone, to worſhip them. Olim Lacedaemoniorum legati Perſarum regem adorare noluerunt timentes vnicum ſuum Dominum. The Lacedemonian Embaſſadours in old time, would not worſhip the King of Perſia, though greatly prickt on thereunto by his Courtiers, becauſe they feared their onely Lord. So ſhould wee (thinkes Origen) and with farre greater reaſon, refuſe to giue worſhip to any other then our Lord God onely, etiamſi ſatellites horum principum daemones at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Angeli, &c. though Angels

or deuills (indeede the deuills angels) draw vs neuer ſo much aſide into error. I paſſe by many things, becauſe I haue many to goe thorough. Whereas Celſus had ſaid, that if they will needes worſhip but one God, by that reaſon they muſt not adore Chriſt neither, &c. Origen thus anſwers: Si Celſus intellexiſſet illud, Ego & Pater vnum ſumus, & iterum, Sicut Ego & Tu vnum ſumus, non putaſſet nos alium colere Deum. That is: If Celſus had knowne the force of thoſe words, I and my Father are one, or, As thou, O Father, and I are all one, hee would neuer haue thought vs to haue worſhipt another God, though we worſhippe Chriſt together with the Father. By which we ſee, that worſhip belongs onely to God, and to Chriſt, no otherwiſe then as he is God, euen one God with the Father, and that they onely are to be worſhipped, who are ſo ſubſiſting in that vnitie of Godhead, and trinitie of Perſons, as the honour done to one, neceſſarily reflects vpon them all. Which, as I haue often ſaide, is not the Saints lot, becauſe they are infinitely ſhort of that diuine prerogatiue, though neuer ſo eminent in the ranke of creatures. Where, I cannot but inſert, as it were into Origens ring, this gemme of Athanaſius, it is ſo ſutable, though I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake of him more particularly anon. In his booke de Incarnat. verbi, thus he ſaies; Si adoras hominem Chriſtum, eò quòd inhabitet in eo dei verbum, eâdem operâ adora Sanctos quoque, ob Deum, qui domicilium in ijs habet. That is: If thou worſhip Chriſt, becauſe the word dwells in him, (to wit, dwels in him by grace, and not by perſonall vnion) worſhip the Saints too, in whome God alſo dwells. As who would ſay, that neither the Saints are to be worſhipped, though God dwell in them, nor any thing which is leſſe then the Deitie it ſelfe. Whereas, doubtleſſe, if there had beene a worſhip proper to Saints, neither Origen, nor Athanaſius might haue done them this wrong, to depriue them of all worſhip, vnder colour of the Diuine; but here, if euer, the diſtinction ſhould haue ſhewed it ſelfe, either of latria and dulia, or cultus maior & minor, as Bellarmine neatly calls it, or minimus & maximus, or minor minimo,

               § 53. I ſee I ſhould be long, if I would lay forth all the treaſure, which the aforeſaid booke of Origens againſt Celſus containes, condemning the idolatrie that raignes now in Poperie. That which hath hitherto beene alleadged, may ſeeme to make againſt the worſhip of Angells, ſomewhat generally. Heare we now a word or two of prayer and Inuocation of them in particular, how that is relliſhed by Origen, and ſo conclude.

                  . That is: Away with Celſus his counſell, ſaying, that we muſt pray to Angells: let vs not ſo much as once heare of it. FOR VVE MVST PRAY ONELY TO GOD, which is aboue all, and we muſt pray to the word of God his onely begotten Sonne, the firſt borne of all creatures, and we muſt beſeech him, that he as high Prieſt would offer 
                  As OVR RIGH PRIEST. But the Saints are not ſo. Yet this is Origens appropriating reaſon here. And if the Schoolemen denie that an Angel may miniſter the cō
                     munion, what more right haue they to of

                      our praiers? Is it not a prieſtly action? 
                  vp our prayers to his God and our God, after himſelfe hath receiued them. And though nothing can be either more pregnant or more perſpicuous thē this, which Origen hath both deliuered, & by reaſon confirmed, yet adde we, as it follows, in the very ſame place. Onely thus premiſing. It ſeemes Celſus, beſides all other honours and prerogatiues, which willingly he garniſhed his Angels with, (whoſe fauour and good affection he magnified no leſſe mightily, then the Adioynder doth the Saints, when he dilates their happineſſe who haue them for their patrons,) yet farther allowed them ſaith, and prayer, in particular; the two things now in queſtion, betweene the Biſhop and the Adioynder. Celſus words were, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : and, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is: That we muſt both pray to them, and put our truſt in them, that they may be gratious vnto vs. And becauſe,

though they are no Gods, yet they belong to God, (as chiefe Miniſters no doubt, &c.) What ſaies Origen of this? How does he value the Angels fauour? 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. That is: What talke ye of the fauour, or patronage of Angels?) He that hath the God which is aboue all things, gratious vnto him, for his pietie towards him, and becauſe he hath entertained [in his heart by faith] that ſame Angell of the Great Counſell of God, the Lord Ieſus, if he [can] content himſelfe with the fauour of God, through Ieſus Chriſt, he may boldly ſay, as one whom all the whole armie of the deuills cannot hurt, The Lord is my light, and my ſaluation, whome then ſhall I feare? The Lord is the defendour and protector of my life, of whome then ſhall I be afraid? Yea, and he ſhall ſay, Though a legion of men were ſet in battell array againſt me, yet ſhall not my heart be troubled nor diſmaied. Againe, in the ſame booke; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. That is: But we to whome we giue our firſt fruits, to him [and to him onely] we ſend vp our prayers: (now firſt fruits are Gods, in ſignum, & in recognitionem, vniuerſalis dominij, as your Schoolemen teach vs, which the Saints, I hope, haue no right in, vnleſſe you will make many Gods) hauing A GREAT HIGH PRIEST that hath entred the Heauens, Ieſus the Sonne of God. And we hold faſt this confeſſion whiles we liue, hauing God fauourable to vs, and his onely begotten Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, beeing reuealed amongst vs. But if we be in loue with any multitude, whoſe fauour we would gladly purchaſe, [ſuppoſe Angells and Spirits] we learne [out of Dan. 7. and 10.] that thouſand thouſands ſtand by him, and millions of millions miniſter vnto him. Who beholding them that imitate their pietie towards God (with the very ſame countenance, that one would looke vpon his friends and his kinsfolkes,) helpe towards their ſaluation, for ſomuch as they call vpon God, and ſincerely call vpon him: appearing [alſo] Angels obedient to godly men. 
                  vnto them, and thinking that they are bound to yield obedience,

and as it were at the hearing of the watchword, or ſignall, march forth for the benefit and ſaluation of [all] ſuch as PRAY TO GOD; to whome themſelues alſo pray. See yee now that the Angels their praying to God, does not enforce our praying to them? Nay, becauſe they pray to the ſame God with vs, therefore we are taught by that, not to pray to them, but to God with them, as Origen tells you. In whome it followes. For they are all [but] miniſtring ſpirits, [and] ſent forth to miniſter for them that ſhall receiue the inheritance of ſaluation. And yet it followes againe, a little after, to refute Celſus his fonde diſtinction, of ſatrapae aulici, and ſatrapae coeleſtes, or elementares, which is the Papiſts diſtinction at this day, and likewiſe their compariſon of earthly fauourites in Princes Courts, with celeſtiall ſpokeſmen, and mediators for vs, in the kingdome of heauen: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. Looke you (ſaies he) how Celſus hath deuiſed his Satrapae, and Conſuls, and Praefecti, vnder-officers of the great God, after the faſhion of ſilly mortallmen, &c. But this beeing formerly refuted by Ambroſe, we ſhall need no longer to inſiſt vpon it here. Pag. 430. thus we read, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. that is, How much better is it, to entruſt our ſelues with the God which is aboue all things, [hee would haue truſt to bee put in none but in God,] through Ieſus Chriſt which hath taught vs this leſſon, and to craue of him all aide, and preſeruation, euen that which the holy Angels and righteous ſpirits may afford vs: that they may reſcue vs from the naughtie deuills which hover about the earth, & are plunged in ſenſualitie, &c. [The preſeruation through Angels, is to bee ſought for from God, not from Angels themſelues.] What then ſhall we pray to them for, if wee may not pray to them for that, which themſelues immediately and of themſelues may afford? But I will conclude for Origen, and his opinion of this matter, with that one famous ſentence of his, and reiection of Celſus, which is extent in the foreſaid booke, pag. 432. of the Greeke. Celſus therefore hauing endeauoured diuers manner of waies, (as is the faſhion of all ſuch) to diuert the minde from her dependance

vpon God alone, inſomuch as after he had ſought to enfeoffe them to Angels, at laſt hee was not aſhamed to enthrall them to mightie Princes & Potentates here in earth, not caring which way, ſo he diſcouraged pietie, and decayed relligion, (like that vngodly Law-giuer, which forbad Daniel, and all his ſubiects to aske any thing of God, for the ſpace of certaine dayes, but onely of himſelfe.) To this ſubtill deuice of Celſus, I ſay, thus Origen replyes; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. that is, Wee muſt endeauour to pleaſe onely God alone, who is aboue all things: AND VVEE MVST PRAY TO HIM ALONE, THAT HE VVOVLD BE MERCIFVLL TO VS, procuring his fauour with godly pietie, and all manner vertue. And yet if Celſus would needs haue vs, to inſinuate into the fauour of any more beſides the moſt high and ſupreame God, let him conſider, that as when the bodie is mooued, the motion of the ſhadow doth infallibly accompanie it: In like ſort if Almightie God be but propitious vnto vs, it followes that all his friends, both Angels, and ſpirits, and ſoules of the righteous, will be freindly to vs, and take our parts. For they are priuy vnto ſuch, as are thought worthy to finde fauour in the eies of Almightie God. And not onely they meane well to ſuch as are found worthy, but they aſſiſt all ſuch as are forward at the worſhipping of God Almighty, and they pray together with them, and they entreat together with them, and together with them they encline him to fauour. Inſomuch as wee may boldly ſay, that with godly vertuous men praying to God, an innumerable companie of heauenly powers pray together with them VNPRAYED VNTO, or vnſpoken to,

                  ſuccouring with ioynt conſent our mortall and fraile nature, whom they ſee ſo many deuills to make head againſt, and to ſeeke by all meanes to ſubuert their ſaluation, ſpecially ſuch as haue committed themſelues to God, [forſaking and abandoning all other created patronages.] Of Origen thus much. Is there yet any more?
               § 54. You ſay, the Saints were neuer honoured in like manner,

as the heroes of the heathen. Yet you may remember what Mantuan ſaith,

                     Ʋt Latij Martem, ſic nos te ſancte Georgi.
And many ſuch like teſtimonies out of your owne mouths might be alleadged to conuince your idolatries, if we liſt to obſerue them. Or, if the Saints are not honoured like the heroes of the heathen, when as queſtionleſſe they ſtand in like proportion to God, in your opinion, it muſt needs be, becauſe you are borne downe with that truth, that none are to be honoured with relligious worſhip, but onely GOD, in what proportion or diſtance ſoeuer they ſtand vnto him. Culius relligionis, or the relligious worſhip, is not to be giuen to any creature, but to God onely, ſaith S. Auſten, no meane Father, and in no meane worke of his, but another palmare, if I may ſay it without offending you, which the Biſhop cannot doe of his de ciuit. Dei, but you will be euer touching vpon that ſtring. And I meane, contr. Fauſtum, lib. 14. c. 11. Apoſtolus vetat culium relligionis exhiberi creaturae: The Apoſtle forbids relligious worſhip to be giuen to the creature. If the Apoſtles authoritie may mooue with you, forbidding it; let S. Auſten be beleeued deliuering the meſſage, and telling you that he forbids it. S. Chryſoſtome had ſaid vpon Matth. 26. in the homily quoted not long before to the like purpoſe, that when the Apoſtles diſſwaded our Sauiour from ſuffering, he referred them to the Scriptures: Elſe, ſaith he, how ſhall 
                  Matth. 25. 54. Luk. 24. 26. item ibid. 44. 
                  the Scriptures be fulfilled? And ſo, repugnantibus quamvis Apoſtolis, vicit ſententia Scripturarum. But this is two in one, that we bring you now, not an Apoſtle without Scripture, but an Apoſtle in his writing, or the Apoſtolicke Scripture. And for interpretation of it, you haue the iudgement of S. Auſten. The Apoſtle (quoth he) forbids relligious worſhip to be giuen to the creature. And there the Scripture preuailed againſt the Apoſtles, to the deſtroying of our Sauiour. How much more ſhall Scripture, and Apoſtolicke Scripture, preuaile againſt all ſuch pitiful deponents as you rely vpon, to the maintenance of Chriſts honour, which is dearer to him

then his life? So as theſe things are more, if they be laid together, then arguments ab authoritate merè negatiuâ, which you ſo ſcoff at, numb. 73. as if that were the only argument that the Biſhop brought, or not ſufficient to beat you down, as he vrges it. And now to ſhew what a Clerke you are, you charge the Biſhop in the laſt place, with falſe quoting of Athanaſius. You graunt, that in his third oration, contra Arianos, he prooues the diuinitie of our Sauiour Chriſt, from our adoration of him. Of which it is conſequent, that no meere creatures are at all to be adored, neither Saints nor Angels. We take this grant of yours, concerning Athanaſius his authoritie. As for your trifling diſtinctions wherewith you would elude it, they haue beene huffed out before. And yet more may be ſaid in the next chapter, where you ſhal heare your owne Doctor, Dr. Gregor. de Valent. to renounce this diſtinction, and cleane waſh his hands of it. Meane while, S. Auſtens teſtimonie ſo lately quoted, is a choake-peare that you cannot ſwallow, that relligious worſhip is not to be giuen to any creature: Therefore to God onely. Though Athanaſius hath the ſame againe, in another booke of his, viz. De incarnatione verbi, that you may know how familiar this kind of arguing was with Athanaſius. And S. Ambroſe the ſame in 8. ad Rom. Nec Dominus vbi
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     , ſe adorari pateretur, niſi quia Deus: Our Lord would not ſuffer himſelfe to be ſo commonly worſhipped, but that he was God. S. Leo likewiſe if you haue not heard of it before, de paſſione Domini. ſerm. 12. Sine 
                  Idem habet Chryſ. hom. 8. in Matth. 
                  verbi potentia, magi puerum non adorarent: that is, But for the power of the word, the wiſemen would neuer haue worſhipt the child. As much to ſay, Vnleſſe the Child had been the word, that is verie God with vs, and the ſecond perſon in Trinitie. Anſwerable to that in the parable, Matth. 18. of the two debters, whereof one owed his Maſter, the other his fellow-ſeruant, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , v. 6. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , v. 29. The former worſhipt, as a ſeruant ſhould his Maſter, the latter entreated only, as a ſeruant to his fellow-ſeruant, to forgiue the offence, as it was committed againſt him. Neither yet are there

wanting other places of Athanaſius, to the ſame effect. In Epiſt. ad Adelph. contra Arianos, one time thus. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is, We worſhip not any creature, God forbid we ſhould. (No not ſo much as the humanitie of our Sauiour Chriſt, if it were diuided from the God-head: for of that he ſpeakes there: how much leſſe the Saints?) Another time thus, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  Let them know. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. Let them know at laſt, that when we worſhip our Lord in the fleſh, we worſhip no creature. Another time thus moſt diuinely, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : that Creatures worſhip not creatures. is, The creature did not worſhip the creature, when the Sea, and other elements adored our Sauiour, &c. And truely, if worſhip were due from creatures to creatures, there ſhould bee a Dulia of the Sea, and of the winds, &c. to the Saints belonging, as well as Latria to God, and to Chriſt. But you denie that in the ſecond Oration of Athanaſius, contr. Arian. any ſuch thing is to be found, as the Biſhop quotes, namely, that he concludes Chriſt to be God becauſe he is inuocated or prayed vnto. Now truely I might haue beleeued the Biſhops quotation, without farther ſearching, becauſe it was his; yet I conne you thanks for giuing me the occaſion, to read ouer that long, but moſt excellent, Oration. In the end therof (you were wearie belike ere you could turne ſo farre) we thus finde. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Let them know, ſaith he, that the Saints do not 
                  Let them know. 
                  requeſt him to be their helper, that is a meere creature. And not onely there ſo, but he hath the like againe, Oratione contra Gentes; 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . He ſpeakes of images, which the heathen worſhip as Gods, and thus he ſaith: They pray vnto them as Gods (belike Athanaſius would haue none praied vnto but God) and they inueſt them with this honour of the true God. So as praying to, is for God, and the true God, onely. Againe in the ſame booke, he coupleth prayer and the Godhead, thus: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ; That is, How then ſhould theſe be Gods, or how may it beſeeme vs to requeſt any

thing of them? The grand maſter of Requeſts is God onely, with Athanaſius. And yet if you lacke a mediatour, heare him once againe in his booke De Incarnat. verbi: 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is: The word of God alone (to wit, Chriſt, his Sonne) is ſufficient to mediate, or to be our embaſſadour to the Father, in what cauſe ſo euer. The reaſon whereof he giues in his Epiſtle ad Adelph. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is: For one creature can neuer be of force to ſaue another. And therefore not to mediate betweene God and it ſelfe. Yea, if this had beene poſſible, I meane for one creature to vndertake for another, in any ſort or faſhion, the Redeemer of the world might haue been ſome meere man of Gods making, and yet diuided from the Godhead, though a principall Man. Shall I ſpeake yet plainer to you, or doe you vnderſtand me ſufficiently? As you make the Saint to intercede but for ſhew, and pretend that all the 
                     Per Chriſtum Dom. noſtrum, vſed to the Saints. vertue comes from Chriſt: ſo God of his free mercie might haue A new way of redemption out of the Papiſts new-fangle interceſſions; and like that of the Perſians, beating the robe, for the noble mans offence. pardoned vs the fault, and yet chaſtiſed it for certain exemplarie ſatisfaction ſake, in the perſon of that elect creature, man or woman. But this conceit is abhominable, and the worke too weightie for any but the Immanuell, the Sonne of God, to trauaile in, as Athanaſius implies throughout his whole worke, or works rather, quelling you. And ſo much of Athanaſius, and this eight Chapter of yours. For when you tell vs in the ende, Num. 76. that the Deuill enuies the honour of Saints and Angells, and vſeth 
                     S. Chryſoſt. contrariwiſe, (before quoted in 3. ad Coloſſ.) ſaith, the honouring of Angells canie from the Deuills enuying of vs and our honuor: which in all likelihood he more malignes. See alſo Epiphan. quoted in the 9. cap. & how often he puts all this idolatrie to Saints and Images, vpon the Deuill.
                   the Biſhop as an inſtrument to deface them, it may pleaſe you to remember, that the Deuills malice is auncienter to God, then to his Saints; and his intruſion into the titles of the one, much more vſuall then of the other. Ero ſimilis ALTISSIMO, not ſubordinatis. And when he cannot aſpire thether himſelfe, he ingeſts in other partners and compoſſeſſioners, he cares not whome. By

which your wiſdome may weigh, who is more like to be the Deuills proctor, that you talke of ſo queintly, and take heede it be not your ſelfe, euen while you plead for Saints.

                     The Adioynders ſmall droppes in this and the next Chapter, after his greater ſtorme. Earthly Monarchie, Supererogation, Relliques, Merits, Hierome of Adoration, Gregorie of Councells, Supremacie, Engliſh Puritans, Mr. Thomas Rogers, &c. In all which, the Reuerend Biſhop, out of the warines of his owne writing, (which is the Adioynders ſtumbling-blocke) acquites himſelfe from the others moſt vniuſt ſlaunders, and vnciuill reproaches.
               
               § 1. THE Biſhops faults, and herein his changing the ſtate of the queſtion, are the ſubiect of his ninth Chapter. And how firſt doth he change the ſtate of the queſtion? In confounding Peters primacie, with his earthly Monarchie. And of this (ſaith he) before. 
                  1. Earthly Monarchie. And, I thinke, you are anſwered to it before. The ſumme is, that not onely Primacie and Monarchie, but euen ſpirituall and temporall, as you haue tied them together, like Sampſons foxes, are in effect all one. Change of

words is no change of the ſtate of the queſtion, but an opening rather, which is neceſſarie many times, if but for this one cauſe, that men would ſmooth ouer their dangerous and deſperate aſſertions, with plauſible and colourable tearmes, and when thoſe tearmes are once remooued, themſelues grow aſhamed of what they thought to perſwade others before. Like as when ſome old witch is turned out of her dreſſe, wherewith ſhee beſotted as many as ſaw her, and afterward is confounded at the ſight of her owne vglines. In this ſenſe, ſay you hardly, that the Biſhop hath changed the ſtate of the queſtion, for other aime or ſiniſter drift in varying the words he had none. And yet, doe not you, good Sir, graunt at another time, that it is a plaine Monarchie, viz. chap. 5. num. 21. of your Adioynder? Or why doth Sanders entitle his booke, de Monarchia Eccleſiae, but to addoube the Pope a Monarch at leaſt? Or what are the effects of it, but to dispoſe Monarchies? Is not that it we contend about? Laſtly, how many clauſes are there, in your Cardinalls bookes de Pontif. Rom. that ſound this way, and that not hoarſly, but very ſhrilly? euen beſides that in his firſt book, cap. 9. whoſe plaine title is, Quòd Regimen Eccleſiaſticum praecipuè Monarchicum eſſe debeat: That the gouernment of the Church, ought especially to be Monarchicall. Wherein his minde doth not ſo wholly runne vpon Chriſt, to be the chiefe Monarch, but iuſt in the next Chapter, cap. 10. the title is, Probatur PETRI Monarchia, &c. The Monarchie of Peter is here prooued. And that after he had pleaſed himſelfe in his former paines ſo well, about the Church-Monarchie in generall, that he ſaith, Explicatum eſt, &, niſi fallor, ſatis diligenter: We haue ſhewed it, and I beleeue diligently enough. But the word earthly, that offends you. It is no earthly Monarchy. As if the obiects of this power, & the origen from whence it flowes, comming into compariſon, (which are the two waies to iudge of the temporaltie or ſecularitie thereof) it be not plainer which we alleadge, that the obiects thereof are earthly to make it earthly, then that which you pretend,

that the inſtitution is from heauen, to call it he auenly. As for temporall power, we haue before ſhewed you, where Bellarmine calls it ſo, and writes a whole booke of it vnder Lib. 5. de Pont. Rom. See c. 1. h

               § 2. A ſecond is about Supererogation. I will neither hold 2 Supererogation. you, nor the Reader long. The defence of the Biſhop is compendious, and ſtands in this, that either you muſt mend your meaning, or change your word. For Supererogation there is none, where firſt all is not done that ought to be done, and then a vantage too, or ſurplus ouer. Now, for ſo much as there is no man but labours of his defects, and all

Neque enim reſponde bit illa nihil ſe debere, ne convincatur &c. praeclarè. come ſhort of the glorie of God, and all haue neede to crie, Dimitte nobis debita noſtra, forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, which is the Biſhops owne allegation, and yet by you called an impertinent arguing: I ſay, for ſomuch as there is no man liuing, but ſtands charged in the former of theſe two kinds, to be ſomewhat ſhort with God in his reckonings about obedience, therefore it is certaine that Supererogation there can be none, though praetererogation we ſhould graunt you, howbeit ſubtererogation were the fitter word, as the Biſhop hath moſt godlily and acutely told you, wiſhing you to mend the other by this. What you tattle of S. Auſten, is nothing to the purpoſe. As if we could not tell you the like of S. Hilarie, in Pſal. 118. as alſo of Greg. Nazianz. in his firſt Steliteutike againſt Iulian: S. Hierome in many places, and namely ad Pammachium de obitu Paulinae, &c. Whereas, if you looke to the ſcope of that Parable, Luk. 10. no queſtion but that driues cleane another way, namely, that the Lord Ieſus left no part of our ſcore vnſatisfyed to the Father, not to ſhew what we doe in recompence to him; who for certaine are the traueller wounded, and halfe dead in the way, not the hoſt of the houſe, as we are there figured. Nay, the hoſt beeing S. Paul, as both S. Auſten, and S. Hilarie, and the In the places quoted by the Adioynder.
                   author of the Hypognoſtique, l. 3. c. 9. doe conſent, how doth

not that ſhake S. Peters primacy, that the chiefe of the houſe whither the wounded man was carried, ſhould be Paul, not Peter? (for the Church is the Inne, and therefore the hoſt of the Inne, muſt be the cheife in the Church.) Or if you ſay, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a fit reſemblāce for an oecumenicall Paſtor. that he is the ſtabularius, becauſe of his Doctrine, why ſhould S. Paul giue higher rules of perfection, then are to be found either in S. Peter, or any other Apoſtles writing, but for ſome S. Aug. ad Bonifac. l. 3. c. 3. If you ſay the Apoſtle, and name not which Apoſtle, we vnderſtand Paul. cauſe of eminencie of degree, aboue the reſt? Yet they all make him onely to be the ſtabularius, and the Scriptures, to ſay truth, ſhew no leſſe. As for the word ſupererogate, which makes all the ſtirre (yet no ſuch dangerous word in the good Samaritans meaning) S. Auſten he tooke it as it lay in the Text of the old tranſlation, and applying it to vs, though not without a wreſt, as euen now I ſaid, yet gaue the moſt conſonant ſenſe to the faith, that he could then find of it, without building an article, a dogma vpon it, as you fondly doe: whereas, if a man ſhould haue told him, that erogare with ſuper, to pay ouer and aboue, preſuppoſeth the payment of the principall debt, hee would neither haue denied the truth of that ſuggeſtion, nor bluſhed at the humility of our confeſſion, crying all with one conſent, Dimitte nobis debita noſtra, and that the whole world is obnoxious to God, and that, if he ſhould enter into iudgement with his ſeruants, or marke what is done amiſſe, no man would be able to abide it, &c. Neither tell you me, that you alſo are of this opinion, and confeſſe with the forwardeſt, your many ſcapes, and halting obedience. For why then doe you not reforme ſo monſtrous a tearme, eſpecially ſince you peruert it to a more vncouth ſenſe, then euer came in S. Auſtens head, from whome neuer theleſſe you would ſeeme to borrow it? Is it not pitie, that you ſhould talke prowder then you thinke, and ſpeake loftier then you are affected? For if you meane no more then ſo, that a man may doe ſomewhat, which may bee pleaſing to God, and yet not deſcending of his rigorous iniunction or taxation, as Tertullian ſaies wittily (though conſidering contra Pſych. the cauſe he then maintained, ſcarce Catholikely, as your

ſelues will not denie,) Non tantum obedire debeo Deo, ſed adulari, We muſt not only obey God, but addoulce him and flatter him; I ſay, if this be all, we differ not much from you, neither about refraining marriage, nor refuſing hyre for preaching the 
                  The Adioynders examples. 
                  Goſpel, (as for an Apoſtles labouring with his own hands, look you to that, how you will cenſure it.) Though you ſhall do well to conſider, what S. Chryſoſtome writes, Hom. 5. in 1. Rom. alluding to that of our Sauiour no doubt, When ye haue done all that ye ſhould, ſay ye are vnprofitable ſeruants, & therefore bee far from craking of ſupererogations. His words are, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is, It was a debt that which the ſeruant did, if he did ought at all. For whatſoeuer things we doe, we doe but fulfill a duty in ſo doing. Wherefore Chriſt himſelfe ſaid, When you haue done all things, &c. ſay, Wee are but vnprofitable ſeruants, for what we ſhould doe, that we haue done, [and no more.) You will ſay, that at another time, S. Chryſoſtome ſaith, S. Paul flew ouer the line of the Law, and did more

                  then was commaunded him. Therefore you muſt conſtrue that place by this; and aboue all things mollifie the hard word Supererogate, learning rather of the Biſhop how to change your rough and ill choſen tearmes, then carping him for changing the queſtion, which he changeth not.
               § 3. The third is ridiculous. Call you that alſo changing the ſtate of the queſtion, that when the Cardinall ſaies, Chriſt 
                  3 Adoration of Chriſt. 
                  is to be adored in the Sacrament, the Biſhop takes exception to his limitation, and ſaies, Apage verò, Away for ſhame, & why not out of the Sacrament too? Rather the Cardinall changeth Chriſt, a thing of greater importance then the ſtate of the queſtion, expounding himſelfe thus, The Sacrament, that is, Chriſt in the Sacrament. Is Chriſt the Sacrament? Is the author and the inſtitution all one? doth the ſubſtance and the ſymbolum differ nothing? Doth not Bellarmine ſay, that the De Rom. Pont. l. 4. c. 16. Sacraments of both Lawes, viz. Baptiſme & Circumciſion, are neither good nor bad of themſelues, but indifferent? And is Chriſt ſo? Are you ſo indifferent what you thinke or ſay of

Chriſt? What a change then make you here, that cry out vpon changing? Wee deny not that the fleſh of Chriſt is to be adored, whether we eate, or eate not. Yea, with Auſten and Ambroſe, we adore it the rather, when we partake the 
                     Ambroſ. lib. 3. de Sp. Sanct. c. 12. Aug. in Pſal. 98. Sacrament. For when haue we greater cauſe of ſo doing, I meane of adoring, and falling downe, and thanking God, then when that buſineſſe awakes our conſideration? Then, I thinke, is the time exultandi ſpiritu, and yet procidendi corpore. Adorauerunt, & manducauerunt, ſayes the Pſalme. Which S. Auſten turnes hither, I ſay not how rightly. But, Nemo manducat panem illum, niſi priùs adorauerit. No man eates of that bread, vnleſſe he firſt worſhip. Let-it be granted. He doth not ſay, vnleſſe he worſhip the bread firſt, for which you ſtriue. Solum contemptum non vult cibus ille, ſaith he elſwhere, In Pſal. 118. 
                  That foode askes no more of vs, but that we contemne it not: that we honour it as a Sacrament, not as the Lord of the Sacrament; as Panis Domini, not as Panis Dominus, to ſpeak with the ſame Auſten, Tract. 59. in Iohan. whom wee more then honour, we adore and worſhip at that time, at other times, in the Sacrament, without the Sacrament, when, where not? Why ſhould this diſlike you? And yet, this is the effect, of all that which you cauill at, in the Biſhops doctrine, in this place. Where you might doe better to correct your owne manner of ſpeaking, then traduce his. For in your 8. Num. here, ſpeaking of the Elements going with Chriſt, which is the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, or as you call it the thing, and how we ought not to make diuorce betweene them two, you bring for example, the humanitie of our Sauiour Chriſt accompanying his diuinitie, ſo as worſhipping the one, we worſhip the other, in the vnitie of his perſon, &c. And to enforce this compariſon, you begin your ſentence with, As well might he ſay, which is very inconſiderate, that I cenſure it no harder, to thinke that the Elements or formes of the Sacrament, are linked to Chriſt in as ſtraight a band, as his diuinitie and humanitie are betweene themſelues; or that the one of theſe couples, may be diuorced with equall facilitie,

as the other. The formes without Chriſt, is no impoſſible matter, Chriſt without the formes, how vſuall, how neceſſarie? and yet you would haue theſe, to goe as well together, as Nature with Nature doth in his ſacred perſon. Who though they ſhould not be diuided in ordinarie euent, Nunquam depoſuit quod ſemel aſſumpſit Axiom. Theol.
                   I meane the ſpecies from Chriſt, no more then his Natures may be parted aſunder, yet ſtill the vnion is very different of the two couples, this hypoſtaticall, that but inſtitutionall, and arbitrarie, and Sacramentall, and therefore you were more hoat then iudicious in your As well, which is full ill rather, and nothing at all to the purpoſe. And albeit the Biſhop did not meane, to put that blame vpon you, which you are ſuſpicious guiltie of (as it ſeemes) in this place, that the bare Sacrament, or formes of bread and wine, are to be adored: yet you may remēber, what a certaine writer of your owne, and he not of the worſt note for ſuch argument, as he hath handled, one Didacus Yanguas a Spaniard, writes of this matter, in his 2. booke of Sermons, Serm. 1. de Sacram.

Chriſts) but the ſpecies alſo, or the formes, of the Sacrament, themſelues, are by their vnion to the fleſh of Chriſt, ſo eleuated, and exalted, that they haue power effectuall, to conferre grace, and other ſpirituall effects, vpon men, as no fewe Diuines haue thought. Can ye be long from adoring them, if ye attribute this to them?
               § 4. Num. 10. You would charge the Biſhop with changing the ſtate of the queſtion, about the adoring of Relliques, and 4 Adoration of Relliques. yet you confeſſe, that for his refuge, he tooke hold of the word Adoration, vſed by the Apologie, and exacteth of the Cardinall ſome proofe of adoration due to relliques, taking adoration in the ſtricter ſenſe, as due to God. Where you ſee, you cannot charge the Biſhop with this fault, vnleſſe you lay it vpon the Apologie

firſt, or rather becauſe the Biſhop was to follow the Apologie 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , he is ſo farre from changing the ſubſtāce of any queſtion betweene you and vs, that he ſticks cloſe to the very words which the Apologie vſeth, whoſe defence he vndertooke, and for that full wiſely here you peach him. But neither doth the Apologie miſtake the queſtion, and when the Biſhop calls for the word adorare, it was partly becauſe the Cardinall had fronted him with one ſuch falſe place out of Chryſoſtome [adoremus for adornemus] partly becauſe venerari implies no worſhip at all, in the Fathers ſenſe, neither 
                     As S. Chryſoſt. in vlt. ad Coloſſ. at thoſe words, Salutatio mea Pauli, manu meâ. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , &c. It was like they would find themſelues ſomewhat affected, at the ſight of Pauls hand. Yet not to worſhip the paper. So we at relliques. Yet S. Pauls hand-writing not inferiour perhaps to relliques. diuine nor humane, but onely reuerent eſteeming, or preſeruing; (as to omit other places, S. Auſten twice together ſaies it of the Bible, The ſame ſaies Conſtantius apud Athan. Graecol. p. 716. in epiſt. ad Epiſc. Arimini congregatos, de doctrinâ & verbo, which S. Auſten ſaies de codice. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Behold the booke and doctrine venerable, or worthie to be worſhipped. What more of the Sacrament, or where the like of the ſpecies?
                   
                  veneramur codicem, we worſhip the booke, de vnit. Eccleſ. c. 12. and yet neither by dulia nor latria;) partly becauſe whatſoeuer be the doctrine of your Schooles in this point, which is commonly ſubiect to great inconſtancie, the practiſe of your idiots muſt ſo be defended, or elſe left for deſperate.
               § 5. In the meane time it is worth the noting, in your 12. Numb. how you confute the Biſhop, about the Angel forbidding S. Iohn to adore him (which the Biſhop had alleadged) to prooue, that other ſtraunge peruerſitie of his, or change of the queſtion, as no leſſe textually, then marginally, both waies, you blaze it, that no adoration of creatures is lawfull. Firſt, ſay you, he makes S. Iohn ignorant, vntill the Angell inſtructed him. Novum crimen, &c. No S. Auſten is of another minde, quaeſt. in Gen. 23. Corrigendus fuerat adorator Angeli. The worſhipper of the Angell, (viz. S. Iohn) was to be reformed. Therefore he might erre. Yea therefore he did erre. doubt a great ſcandall, and vnworthie of S. Iohn, either to offer for his ignorances, with the high Prieſt in the old law, Heb. 9. 7. (and

yet S. Iohn no high Prieſt, nor proportionall to him, but onely Peter to be ſo paragoned) eſpecially when the ignorance was not iuris, but facti, or to haue an Angel to be his ſchoolemaſter. We may call for the oxe and the aſſe to be yours, Eſay 1. which forget neither their Maſter, nor their maſters cribbe, whiles you runne a gaddng poſt greges ſodalium, not content with one or two, vnleſſe you heape vp deities to your ſelues, as they doe doctors, 1. Tim. 4. 3. But this is one exception which you take to the Biſhop. 
                   Another, that he reaſoneth (you ſay) as ſubſtantially, as if ſome holy man of modeſtie and humilitie, refuſing ſome extraordinarie honour done vnto him, ſaying it were to be done, not to him, but to God, one ſhould inferre, that no ſuch reuerence ſhould be done to men. For ſuch no doubt was the caſe betwixt S. Iohn and the Angell, either of them ſhewing their humilitie, and their reſpect they bare the one to the other, &c. Thus you: changing very handſomly the law of relligion, and thoſe abſolute and peremptory words of the Angel, vide ne, into meere complements, and courtings, betweene S. Iohn and the Angel: as who would ſay, Remember your ſelfe, Be not ſo courteous, a ſhadow whereof there was betweene our Sauiour Chriſt and S. Iohn Baptiſt, I graunt, Matth. 3. but betweene the Angel, and the Euangeliſt here, for certaine, none at all. Is adora Deum, and vide ne feceris, of no more force with you, thē ſo? And to your noble inſtāce, of a godly man, putting off a great honour done vnto him, &c. If that godly man were wel learned withall, & ſeene in points of faith, aboue the other, whom he ſhould charge to keepe ſuch honour for God, & not to caſt away vpon him, would you doubt but he were to be liſtened to, and obeyed in his good counſell, not idle complement, as you madly decipher it? So did they in the Acts, I meane Paul and Barnabas, refuſing Act. 14. the Lycaonians, and their wild honours; ſo Peter to the Centurion, ſo Gregorie, ſo your 
                     Ʋincentius, ſo many more, not by complement or courtſhip, but by horror of the fact, and ſtraight cōmandement to deſiſt. You quote in the ſame Numb. S. Greg. idē repetit, in Com. Cant. 8. praeter locos alibi citatos. S. Gregorie, S. Bede, Anſelme, Rupert, Richardus de

                     Ʋictore, to this effect, that the Angell refuſed S. Iohns adoration, in regard of the incarnation of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſince which our nature is reuerenced and respected by the Angells, and they preſume not to take ſuch obeiſance 
                  Now Reader iudge, who comes neerer to Iudaeſme, the Biſhop, and the Church of England, as F. T. obiects in diuers places, or they that reuiue the worſhipping of Angels vnder the new, which theſe Authors confiue to the old Teſtament. 
                  at our hands. Does not this confute you then, for worſhipping them ſtill, and aſcribing ſoueraignty to them (as your relligious ſubmiſſions to them can import no leſſe) who not onely are our conſervi, by right of creation, but inferiour to vs, in ſo much as our nature is vnited vnto the god-head, which theirs is not?
               § 6. You tell vs in your 13. Numb. of three kinds of adoration, and ſay, it is inſtruction for ignorant readers. Wee know but two, Sacred, and Ciuill. You would faine cogge a third, as it were ſemi-ſacred. Whereas, ſecunda relligio, or relligio ſecundae maieſtatis, as Tertullian calls it, is for earthly Apolog contra Gentes. Kings, not for heauenly Saints, who by your diſtinction ſhould inherit it before the other, if it were properly ſo called. But God hauing the firſt relligion, the Emperour the ſecond (as wee ſpeake at leaſt) the Saints is none now, becauſe it muſt not be the third. Therefore they are baniſhed from relligious adoration. To your authorities that you bring out of Gen. 8. Gen. 19. &c. where Angels appeared in viſible formes, and corporall ſhape (for 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Hebr. 13. 2. they that entertained them, knew not whome they entertained) what maruaile if they receiued ciuill adoration, going for men, and not knowne to be other? Or why ſhould we thinke that that was relligious? The ſame I might ſay of Abrahams, the ſame of Lots reſpect, which they ſhewed to Angels. And ſo likewiſe of Ioſuahs, Ioſ. 5. Though, as I ſignified before, ſometimes Chriſt is called the Angel, when he makes apparition, (Athanaſ. cont. Gent. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , The Word, that is Chriſt, is iuſtly tearmed his Fathers Angel, or Meſſenger) and ſometimes alſo God is honoured in his ambaſſadour. Which aduantageth you nothing, that vendicate a proper and a

ſtanding worſhip to the Angels, due by kind, or by excellencie of their order, not onely to the perſon which they caſually ſuſtaine. You ſay, Saul adored Samuels ſoule. Though I beleeue it not of Saul, and there is no reaſon to load him with more infirmities then his owne, yet if you will needes haue it ſo, let him be your example hardly, as alſo of going to a witch, and conſulting with the deuill. How well did you transforme idolatrie into ſorcerie, in your 6. Chapt. where you laboured to put off the Laodicean Councell, who now ſo confound ſorcerie with idolatrie, that by the example you bring of Saul, you may defend the one as well as the other, if at leaſt any ſuch euer were? Abdias, you ſay, was a man in temporall dignitie farre greater then Elias, yet Abdias fell on his face before him, and therein did an act of relligion to Elias. Beleeue it who liſt. And did the Emperours performe When the late king of France Henrie 4. did M. Beza ſuch like honour, diſmounting from his horſe, and running to embrace him, maruaile but this was relligious adoration, in our Adioynders fancie. acts of relligion to the Pope, whē they vſed the like reuerent demeanour towards him? or perhaps the Popes were not ſo relligious of late daies, that the honour done to them ſhould be an honour of relligion. For you would haue it to be relligious, when it is done to relligious men, and for relligions ſake, and ſo to differ from the Ciuill forſooth. Likewiſe, the children of the 
                  Adioynd. cap 9. Numb. 14. 
                  Prophets, worſhipt Elizeus, with relligious adoration, becauſe they ſaw him paſſe the riuer by miracle: a thing which euery damned Greg. Hom. 29. in Huang Corporali

                     . wretch might haue done, to haue wrought a miracle, & yet this muſt challenge relligious adoration. But, if S. Auſtens notation of the word relligion be true, de verâ rell. c. 54. quòd vni deo religet animas noſtras, becauſe it binds our ſouls to God onely, then ſure though S. Auſten had not put in vni Deo, but onely told vs of religation, or of binding, it had been enough to ſhew that S. Auſtens meaning was, that relligious worſhip belonged onely to God, as to whom only we are bound in knots of ſoules-ſeruice, otherwiſe free, beeing fellow-ſeruants betweene our ſelues, as you heard the Angel ſay but lately to S. Iohn. What elſe is there? The

children of the Prophets, adorauerunt Eliam proni in terram, worſhipt Elias falling flat vpon the ground, which you perſiſt to conſtrue of relligious adoration, we ſee no cauſe why it ſhould be ſo, no more then Ruthes to Booz, or Mephiboſheths to Dauid, or the reſt, whome you ſequeſter from this kind your ſelfe, though the Scripture ſpeake of them in the ſame phraſe, as your ſelfe alſo acknowledge, numb. 15. But what meruaile if ye hale in theſe into your muſter, when as Nabuchodonoſor adored Daniel, you ſay, with a relligious adoration, and Iacob worſhipt the top of Ioſephs rodde, which you would make a rood of, a puppet, or what you pleaſe, like the worſhipping of the footeſtoole, of which anone? For as they that run a whoring once after the creature, forſaking the one and onely true God, Rom. 1. change him into the vileſt and lewdeſt ſhapes that may be, of calues, of creeping things, &c. ſo it was meete that when you would bring downe once your relligious adorations, from that diuine ſublimitie, to ſuch pelting traſh, as in reſpect of God is whatſoeuer the world containes, you ſhould ſtay no where, but euen bequeath it to roddes, to foot-ſtooles, and to what not? Was it all one for Iacob in his feeble and accrazed ſtate, to worſhip God vpon the top of his ſtaffe, being vnable without that to ſit vp in his bed, (an act, without all doubt, of moſt abſolute deuotion; for where would not hee worſhip God, that worſhipt him ſo?) is it all one, I ſay, for an old man to worſhip God, raiſing himſelfe vpon his ſtaffe in his bed; and to worſhip the ſtaffe it ſelfe with relligious worſhip? Are you not afraid leaſt this ſtaffe prooue a ſcorpion to chaſtize you, while you argue ſo wantonly, ſo wickedly, and yet ſo weakely: or that your hearers hardly hold their hands from you, to be mockt ſo groſſely? Or if Ioſeph be this rodde, as other ſome conſtrue it, like that phraſe in Eſay, Egredietur virga de radice Ieſſe, will you perſwade vs that Iacob worſhipt his ſtaffe, becauſe he worſhipt God in the hopes of his ſonne Ioſeph, ſhooting vp like a plant out of a pleaſant ground, as they that came of the

ſtocke of Ieſſe before named? But let vs heare the Fathers, and how they interpret it. S. Primaſius two wayes vpon this place, but in neither of them dauncing after your pipe. One while hee ſayes, that Iacob worſhipt his ſonne Ioſeph as a temporall Prince ouer all the land of Egypt. But if you take it of a ſpirituall and relligious worſhip, then worſhipt hee Chriſt (ſaies hee) and his myſticall Kingdome, ouer all creatures, both in heauen and earth, not any materiall rodde, which is heatheniſh to Primaſius. His words are. Iacob cognouit per illam virgam Ioſeph, deſignari regnum Chriſti. Non ergo virgā adorauit pro Deo, ſecundum ritum gentilium, &c. The ſame words hath Remigius, as it were borrowed of Primaſius. But hee proceedes; Vel quantum ad literam, fortaſſis ſecundum conſuetudinem illius temporis adorauit virgam Ioſeph, quem videbat Dominum eſſe totius regni terrae Aegypti; quâ ſcilicet ratione, Heſter legitur adorâſſe virgam Aſſueri. That is, Iacob vnderſtood that the Kingdome of Chriſt was reſembled and figured by that rod of Ioſeph. Hee did not therefore worſhip the rodde for God [or, with diuine worſhip] which is the manner of heathens and gentiles, &c. Or happily to vnderſtand this text literally, it may be that according to the cuſtome of thoſe times, hee proceeded to worſhip Ioſephs rodde or ſcepter, whome he ſaw to be Lord ouer all the land of the Kingdome of Aegypt. In like ſort as Eſter is recorded to haue worſhipped Aſſuerus his ſcepter. This is Primaſius his iudgement. 
                     Haymo hath the ſame word

                  Anſelme vpon the place ſaith, Nos in nouâ tranſlatione legimus, Adorauit Iſrael Deum. Iacob worſhipt God, (not the rodde but God.) Which in our Engliſh tranſlation, the Rhemiſts ſo miſlike, that they call it an intollerable corruption. And againe: Si adorâſſet faſtigium virgae illius, non eſſet dicenda ſides. To worſhip the toppe of a ſtaffe, had beene no faith (Infidelity rather, and Idolatry, I ſuppoſe) whereas the Apoſtle brings in this for an example of his faith. But he adored (ſaies Anſelme) ſublime imperium Chriſti, the lofty kingdome and gouernment of Chriſt, to which he ſubmitted

himſelfe with all his heart. And whereas ſome read, Adorauit ad caput lectuli (which the Hebrew is not againſt) hee ſayes, the holy man had his bedde ſtand ſo, that he might compoſe himſelfe to prayer in it, vpon any occaſion, (but to prayer to God onely) and that was his worſhippe here ſpoken of by the Apoſtle. As for Auſten, our Rhemiſts confeſſe no leſſe of him, and in one word they are ſo bare vpon this place, as they haue not one Father ſo much as to pretend for them, by way of colour. And this may ſuffice about the worſhipping of the ſtaffe, which Eraſmus makes ſo light of, that he thinkes, to deride it, is to refute it. They haue found out (ſayes hee) a new fangle worſhip, the worſhip of the ſtaffe, by their quaint Metaphyſicks, and their rare deuiſes. Thus hee.
               § 7. As for the worſhipping of the footſtoole, adorate ſcabellum, for adorate ad ſcabellum, per ellipſin praepoſitionis alioqui bis inculcandae, and ſomewhat like alſo in the Hebrew, though not altogether the ſame, the Biſhop hath ſo plentifully Reſponſ. ad Apolog. pag. 201. cleered it in his anſwer, that it is more then wondrous how you dare meddle with it, but that you are more then impudent in outfacing vs with any thing. And by this alſo may be ſeene, to what ſimple animals your worke is dedicated, that dare offer to feede them with ſuch dirt for dietbread.
               § 8. Nabuchodonoſors alſo adoring of Daniel, is as friuolous, which you will needes haue to be with a relligious adoration. 
                  Dan. 2. But you may remember, that incenſe alſo and ſacrifice was offered to Daniel by Nabuchodonoſor, and to be ſhort, he worſhipt him in all points as a God. Will you by this then prooue your worſhipping of Saints? Ioſeph. l. 10. e. 11. Antiq. Iud. Nabuchodonoſor non aliter Danielem quàm Deum adoravit, divinis iuvenem dignatus honoribus: that is, Nabuchodonoſor worſhipt Daniel no otherwiſe then God himſelfe, yeelding diuine honour to the young man. S. Hierome reſolues it, at laſt, thus. Regem ſtupore confuſum ignorâſſe quid faceret. That the King amazed at the wonderfull

effects of Daniel, knew not what he did, and ſo diſcerned not inter ſervum & Dominum, betweene the ſeruant and the maſter, in giuing honour. Hieron. Com. in 2. Dan. And Theod. Com. in eundem loc. ſaith, he giues the Prieſts charge to offer incenſe to Daniel, not preſuming himſelfe vpon that ſeruice, as too ſacred for him. Whereas the honour due to Saints, is ſuch, as any bodie, not onely the Prieſts, may performe vnto them, in the Papiſts opinion. Yea, I beleeue, they had rather truſt the poore ignorant people with this kind of duties, then their more intelligent Clergie-men. And Bellarmine does as good as confeſſe this one where, telling vs how dangerous it is, to vnfold their myſteries, of Saints, and Images, in a popular aſſembly. But Theodoret brings yet another thing to our mind. Cōſydera quanti ſit, illū arrogantem & inſaniae morbo correptum, adorare captivum Iudaeorum, in ordinē mancipiorum redactum, &c. That is; [Conſider what a thing it was for that proud and haughtie Tyrant, almoſt madde with pride, to adore a Iewiſh priſoner, one no better then a ſlaue, &c.] Which may teach the Ieſuites, thoſe ſtormers againſt the authoritie of heathen Magiſtrates ouer beleeuers, that ſeruitude vnder Infidels, is no diſparagement to true vertue, whereſoeuer to be found. S. Chryſoſtome alſo, though he may ſeeme to wauer through Com. in 11. ad Hebr. Homil. 26. in Ethico. vncertenties, as one that does not greatly care to aſſoyle the queſtion, (profeſſing that he had rather giue his auditors occaſion to ſearch it by themſelues) yet once or twice hee enclines this way; and with more reaſon. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is, Hee whome all the earth honoured as God, reckoned of Daniel euen as of a God. And afterward comparing him with Herod, or rather more, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is, But Daniel accepted of diuine honour, not of words onely tending that way (as Herod did.) Which how it may ſtand with Daniels pietie, it were good that you would conſider a while. For Chryſoſtome meant not to leaue him with that aſperſion, and yet thus you ſee hee declares the nature of that honour,

which the Tyrant affoarded him. Laſtly, his reaſon is, that the King called him Beltazzar, which was the name of his God. Therefore it is likely he honoured him as God. Neither does Chryſoſtome neglect the note, formerly made by Theodoret vpon this place, that captiuitie vnder infidels, is no abatement to true vertue. For here the conquerour adores the priſoner, &c.
               
               § 9. As for the ſignification of the word adoro, if to that end onely you alleadge the place, to ſhew what the word may ſometimes ſignifie concerning the adoring of one man by another, & that not ciuilly only, but relligiouſly, it followes not that it is euery where to be ſo taken and conſtrued of a relligious worſhip, if in this monſtrous and exoticall one act of Nabuchodonoſor towards the Prophet Daniel, it imports ſo. Your ſelfe bring many places, and many examples, of Scripture, and holy men there recorded, by whome you confeſſe it is to be taken onely of eiuill adoration, num. 15. of this Chapter. As of Iudith to Holophernes, of Abigail to Dauid, &c. And Gregorie de Valentia, your champion for Idolatries, yet in the place that I ſhall quote by and by out of him, is not afraid to graunt as much, euen in this very cauſe, that Vno eodem
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      communi vocabulo res etiam diuerſiſſimae ſignificantur; that is, that 
                     Ʋnitie of tearmes makes no identitie of things: or, diuerſe things are ſometimes ſignified by the ſame words. Laſtly alſo, to your other quidditie, that The worſhip of Saints is relligious worſhip, becauſe yeilded to Saints for their relligion ſake: I denie your reaſon. As well might you ſay, that the worſhipping of a woodden image is blockiſh worſhip, becauſe done to a blocke; or to releeue a ſouldier in caſe of neceſſity, is an act of ſouldierie, becauſe done for conſideration of his ſouldierlike exploits in former times. Rather ſay, becauſe it ſprings from the vertue of relligion in the mind of him that yeilds it, as the original of his act, & yet imperāt only, not elicient, dirigent, not exequent, as your School-men loue to ſpeak. But ſo are many acts beſides, neither done to relligious perſons, or done to them,

and yet not for the relligions ſake, which neuertheleſſe are accounted relligious actions, becauſe they proceed from the vertue of relligion in the doers. As euen your owne man acknowledges, Greg. de Val. Tom. 3. Diſput. 6. Quaeſt. 11. &c. denying flatly that the worſhip of Saints is properly or immediately relligious worſhip, yet he addes in this wiſe: Quanquam non eſt negandum, quin ipſd virtute relligionis erga Deum, vt ad VIRTVTVM ALIARVM officia, ſic etiam ad exhibendum ſanctis honorem OBSERVANTIAE, (not relligionis) induci poſſimus. That is, [Though it is not to be denyed, that we may be mooued, as to other offices of ſundry vertues, ſo to yeeld the Saints the honour of obſeruancie, out of the vertue of relligion towards God in our hearts.] So as both he would haue relligion to be onely towards God, and yet an exciter or ſetter on of our reuerence to Saints, per modum imperantis, as I ſaid before. And ſhould we reſt in your deuiſe of relligious worſhip, becauſe giuen to certaine men for their relligions ſake, weigh the conſequence, and tell me how you like it. For by this meanes it might come to paſſe, that two men at one time ſhould both giue and take relligious worſhip of one another, and that equall in meaſure, if they equall in merits, which were very vncouth (to ſay no more) that you ſhould worſhip him that worſhipt you, & that iuſt ſo much, & at the very ſame time. Finally, whereas the Biſhop denyes, that creatures may be adored, and yet both you and we grant, that there may be 
                  The Adioynder ſinds a knot in a bulruſh, a contradiction in the Biſhop where none is. 
                  a ciuill adoration, you muſt vnderſtand the Biſhop to ſpeake of the ſacred or relligious adoration, in which fenſe S.

As here S. Hierome. In the full ſource of his Rhetorique, and where he ſpake without an aduerſary, or to one that could vnderſtand him inoffenſiuely, and with diſcretion ſufficient, he ſpeakes for adoring of Abdias his aſhes, that is zealous reſorting to the place of his buriall (for that is all:) but where he ſpake before his aduerſary, before Vigilantius, like the bird that ſleepes with the thorne at her breaſt, then more vigilantly, more accurately, and more circumſpectly, he denies it vtterly, that they adore either relliques, or things better then relliques, euen thoſe for whoſe ſakes the relliques are made much of. There, error

There, paucorum culpa non praeiudicat relligioni, the aberration of ſome fewe is no preiudice to relligion. Laſtly, there, Non adoramus, &c. we worſhip neither relliques, nor Martyrs, nor Angels, nor any name that is named either in this world, or in the world to come, but God onely.

to expreſſe his minde by, as namely when he would either fall ſo low, or ſoare ſo high, as no ordinarie word occurreth to him to equall his conceits, though the language hath ſtore enough beſides. So here S. Hierome. Therefore he expounds his adorare in one place, by non adorare, ſed honorare, in another; when the paſſion was cooled, and the iudgement awaked. Non colimus & adoramus, ſed honoramus, &c. lib. 1. contra Vigil. The Grammarians will tell you, becauſe you ſend vs to the Grammarians, that there is a

as Homer ſaies of the champions in their deathfull combat; ſo hard a thing it is to giue you content. But what is it you bring? That, puluerem lingere, is not in all that Epiſtle of S. Hierome ad Marcellam, but onely lambere lignum crucis, not

to licke the duſt, but to licke the wood of the croſſe. A great miſtake ſurely, to put the one for the other. And yet puluerem lingere, to licke the duſt, is the honeſter of the twaine, as S. Auſten deſcribing the idolatry of the Gentiles, whome our Sauiour calleth dogges, in his ſpeech with the poore caytiffe, Matth. 15. (the image of vs all) It is true (ſaith S. Auſten) the Gentiles are dogges, for canum eſt lingere ſaxa, 
                  Serm. de Temp. it is a dogges property to licke ſtones, and ſo ligna too, ſo ſtatuas, and the reſt; whereas the other the Pſalme directly leads vs to, ſpeaking of the conuerſion of the Gentiles to God, that they ſhall licke the duſt of his feete, or foot-ſtoole. 
                  Pſalm. If you are not aſhamed of the firſt, why ſhould you be of the ſecond, which is ſo much more countenanced, as you ſee, then the other? Or, to ſpeake in your owne words which you delight in, as it were your darling, if ye be cruci-ligni-lambi, why ſhould you bee afraide to be pulueri-lingi? But if not this, how the other? So that you ſee in effect it comes all to one. But for ſo much as the Biſhops drift was, onely to ſhew that S. Hierome ſpeakes figuratiuely in that diſcourſe, and you haue no way to reſiſt him, but onely by ſaying, that all the Epiſtle is not figuratiue, as if ſome might not be, though all were not, let vs ſee if you thinke good, not how many elegant metaphores and allegories, as you confeſſe, are ſcattered throughout the context of that Epiſtle, but whole periods of ſpeech, tending to the ſame purpoſe of deuotion, can be conſtrued no otherwiſe then onely figuratiuely.

That is, As oft as we goe into the ſepulchre of our Lord, ſo often we ſee our Sauiour wrapt in a linnen cloth to lie before vs. Is this true properly? Is it true without a figure? Yet adde againe, Et paululum ibidem commorantes, rurſum videmus Angelum ſedere ad pedes eius, & ad caput ſudarium conuolutum. That is, And ſtaying there but a while, againe we ſee thee Angell to ſit at his feet, and his clothes wrapt or folded towards his head. Can ye vnderſtand this to be true without a figure? But

come to the ende, and to the place that you now touch vpon, ſee whether there be any ſcanty of figures. In Oliueti montem, cum aſcendente Domino, voto & animo ſubleuemur. Let vs be lifted vp in heart and wiſhes into the mount of Oliuet, together with our Lord aſcēding. Yet our Lords aſcent is long ſince paſt, and we come too late to aſcend with him now. Againe, Videre exire Lazarum faſcijs colligatum, & fluenta Iordanis ad lauacrum Domini puriora, &c. To ſee Lazarus come forth bound about with his partlets, and the riuer of Iordan waxing the purer for our Sauiours bathing in it. Inde ad mare veniemus Genezareth, & de quinque & ſeptem panibus videbimus in deſerto quinque & quatuor hominum miillia ſaturata; That is, From thence we will come to the ſea of Genezareth, and of fiue loaues and ſeauen, we will ſee fiue and foure thouſand men ſatisfyed in the wildernes. Is this alſo true properly? or could Marcella, and her inuitreſſes, ſee theſe things without a figure? But what a ſhake doth he giue to your ſuperſtition of Saints, when he concludes thus? Pergemus ad Itabyrium, & tabernacula ſalnatoris, non vt Petrus voluit cum Moſe aut cum Elia, ſed cum patre cernemus & ſpiritu ſancto. Wee will goe to the mount Taber, and we will there behold the tabernacle of our Sauiour, not as Peter would with Moſes and Elias, but with the Father and the holy Ghoſt. Doe you ſee whome he leads vs to, and from whom he weanes vs? From Moſes, and Elias, that is, the Saints, to our Sauiour and his company, to wit, the Father and the holy Ghoſt. Vnleſſe happily it delight you to erre with Peter, becauſe Petrus aliter voluit, Peter ſeemed to be of another minde. I beleeue your ſelues will be glad here to acknowledge a figure.
               
               § 13. To conclude about relliques, and their adoration, how may they be beleeued to haue adored relliques, that were no friends to the keeping of them, as we may gather diuerſe wayes? For though relliques may be kept, and not adored; yet no adoration, if no keeping. S. Ambroſe lib. 1. de Abraham. cap. 9. bids vs, non diutiùs inhaetere

That is in effect, to bury the departed, but not to dwell long vpon dead coarſes; which how it can ſtand with the preſeruing of relliques, I ſay not honouring, obſeruing, worſhipping them? And againe the ſame Father, l. 2. de officijs, c. 28. In ſepulturis Chriſtianorum requies defunctorum eſt: In the buriall of Chriſtians, is the repoſe of the dead: which ſtands not with relliques, either to be preſerued, or digged vp. And in the ſame place againe, Nemo poteſt indignari humandis fideliū relliquijs ſpacia eſſe laxata: that is, It is no fault, nor thing to be grudged at (vnleſſe then by the Arians, who carpt S. Ambroſe without cauſe, and ſo now by the Ieſuites) that the ground is enlarged to bury the remnants of faithfull bodies maſſacred.) Is this man likely to countenance relliques, or the worſhipping thereof? Sozomen, lib. 4. c. 20. ſayes, that when there was conſultation about remoouing the bodie of Conſtantine the great, out of the Church of Conſtantinople, (where it was firſt interred,) becauſe they feared the fall of that Church, this purpoſe was reſiſted by ſuch as tooke part with the Nicene Councell, that is, the godly and the Orthodoxe, who held it, ſaith Sozomen, for no leſſe a ſacriledge, to tranſlate dead bodies, then to breake open tombes violently and felloniouſly. And do not theſe condemne the vſe of relliques, which in you is accompanied with tranſlation, with circumgeſtation, and ſuch like pompes? Yet behold, when the Church was like to fall, they refuſed to be of partie with the preſeruers of the bones of that diuine Emperour, by tranſlating them, not but that they were worthy the preſeruing with the beſt.

                  Optatus will tell you how wicked ſhe was, in not receiuing the Sacrament of the Lords body and blood, vnleſſe ſhee had kiſſed the relliques of a certaine Martyr that morning, if at leaſt a Martyr, ſaith Optatus. Yet you are for kiſſing them, in your numb. 24. very definitiuely. And if it bee godly to kiſſe them, why not alſo to begin the communion with ſuch a ſeruice? And may not we ſay of your Martyrs, as Optatus doth of hers, of Lucillaes I meane, ſi tamen Martyris, if at leaſt they be Martyrs, either your auncient, or your moderne? But Optatus miſlikes this doting vpon Martyrs relliques, though true Martyrs, as the place ſheweth. Of Ioſeph and Nicodemus, no ſnatchers after relliques, not ſo much as clothes, though they had as faire opportunitie as euer any, I told you before. Yet doubtleſſe their behauiour was a leſſon to poſteritie, how to be affected towards the dead bodies of Saints. They committed it to the ground, and that was all, though the rather to a garden, in the hope of reuiuing & reflouriſhing the third day, as from a fertile ſoile, as S. Ambroſe ſweetly gathers, alluding to our Sauiours ſpeedie reſurrection. So likewiſe of S. Gregory

De quibus opinor Dominus in Euangelio, Surrecturos in noviſſimis qui etiam electos in errorem inducant, &c. Is it not pitie that we Engliſhmen, will not traffike with the Ieſuits, for ſuch ghoſtly commodities? defence of the Chriſtian faith, or ſome limbe of his bodie caſually brought to hand, to preſerue it from vnſeemly and vnmanly diſparagements, who but for his conſtancie in Chriſts cauſe, might happily haue been buried in his aunceſtors tombes; another thing to conuert

it to prophane idolatrie. I haue omitted Origen, lib. 8. contra Celſum, who thus profeſſes of his time, and of the doctrine they had learnt. Organa rationalis animae ſepulchro honorificè demand are didicimus: Wee haue learned to recommend honourably to the graue, the inſtruments of the ſoule reaſonable, that is, the bodies of men, and the members thereof. Therefore not to make relliques of them. In Victor Ʋticenſis, lib. 1. de Perſecut. Vandal. we haue two examples hereof. One of Armogaſtes, a godly Chriſtian, who deſired Felix (another of the profeſſion) ſepeliri ſub arbore ſiliquae,. i. that being dead he might be buried vnder a homely tree (if a tree,) non cum triumpho & gratiâ, not with triumph, and fauour, or ſolemnitie. As for the Sarcophagus, which appeared, as it were by miracle, in the place by him allotted for his buriall, I impute that to the ſatisfaction of his godly deſire, about a quicke conſumption, or turning into nothing, then which nothing can be more repugnant to your ceremonie of Relliques. Another in the ſame booke a little before, of Deogratias, Biſhop of Carthage, whoſe worthy members (ſo ſpeakes the Hiſtorian) the people out of their zeale might haue violently ſnatcht away, or pulled a ſunder, niſi CONSILIO PRVDENTVM neſciente multitudine ſepeliretur:. 1. vnleſſe he had been buried whiles the people did not know of it, at the ſuggeſtion or directiō of wiſe men. So as to reſiſt your Relliquations (the true bankruptures of relligion) is wiſdome to Victor, and to the auncient Chriſtians that liued before him. But let S. Hierome end this matter, in De vitâ Hilarionis, where he wil tell you, that S. Hilarion gaue order before his death, to be buried in his clothes, in tunicâ cilicinâ, in his coate of ſackecloath, & ſago ruſtico, and his homely cloake, or of the country faſhion, cum cucullâ, with his hood, & ne puncto quidem horae poſt mortem reſeruari, and not to be kept aboue ground, no not an inſtant of an houre, after his departure. Would he haue beene content to haue been pickled vp in

Relliques? And in the ſame booke, Anthony charged them that were about him, to burie him priuily, where no man might know of it, leaſt one Pergamius, as he ſaid, a very rich man of that country, & belike deùout in his kind, ſhould ſteale away his bodie, and encloſe it in a ſhrine. The like was done to Moſes bodie for the ſame cauſe, God euery where forbidding to ſeek the liuing among the dead, as you doe plainly in your relliques, worſhipping not them, but Chriſt in them, as you ſticke not to triumph, numb. 25. of this chapter. But ſo much ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken hereof.
               § 14. Yet you thinke to mend the matter, with your De Civit. Dei. l. 10, c. 1. & quaeſt. in Geneſ. moath-eaten diſtinction of adoratio latriae, quoting S. Auſten for it, num. 28. But S. Auſten neuer ſaid, that we may adore a creature, whether Saint or Saints rellique, with a relligious adoration, no not vnder latria, or neuer ſo dulically. He ſaith, the word adoration is equiuocall, which is very true, I graunt, and transferred to men, whome we adore ciuilly: for he ſpeaks of Abraham adoring the Gentiles, that is, the children of Heth, which for certaine was but ciuill. Quaeſt, in Gen. 23. But taking it in the ſenſe of relligious adoration, as wee now doe in our queſtion with you, he neuer denies but that it is proper to God. I will obſerue a fewe clauſes, out of his de Ciuit. Dei, which you quote, lib. 10. c. 1. He expounds relligionem ſeruare erga Angelos, by ſacrificare, and ſacra facere. But you will haue no ſacrificing to them, nor S. Auſten neither. Therefore no relligion is due to them. His words are; Nunc videndum ac diſſerendum eſt, quomodò credendi ſint Angeli velle à nobis pietatem relligionem

Againe, Seruitus duliae quae debetur hominibus, is ſuch a ſeruitude, according to which the Apoſtle cōmands ſeruants to be ſubiect to their maſters. Onely this, is due hominibus, to men, ſaith S. Auſten, or of this kind onely. And will this kind of ſeruice

content your Saints? It will not certainly. Therefore S. Auſten patronizeth not your dulia to Saints. Meane while, you may well bluſh reading this place of S. Auſten, or of the Apoſtle either, concerning the dulia due to maſters from their ſeruants, that haue extinguiſhed all allegiance and ſubiection vpon earth, what The two queſtions ſtill croſſe, or rather kiſſe one another, of our ſubiection to Princes, and deuotion to God.

Auſten goes forward, to ſhew, that not onely theſe things, quibus nos relligioſà humilitate ſubmittimus, to which we ſubmit our ſelues by a conſcionable humilitie, or a relligious humilitie, are ſaid coli; but etiam ſubiecta nobis, diuerſe things vnder vs: ſo that the cultus of creatures, is of that kind, by which, things that are inferiour to vs, may be honoured, and therefore ſurely not relligious. Yea, but S. Auſten ſaies, that we ſubmit our ſelues to the creature, relligiosâ humilitate, by relligious humilitie. What maruell, when hee acknowledges in the ſame place, that not onely adoratio, but relligio, and pietas, are words aequiuocall, or of diuerſe ſignifications? For we are pij in parentes, (which euen S. Paul ſhewes to Timothy) and

To all theſe, we performe a reuerence of relligion. But relligion, as it ſtands for holy, for ſacred, and ſpirituall, you are not able to ſhew, where S. Auſten euer alloweth to the creatures. Therefore your diſtinction of dulia is impertinent, and neuer owned by S. Auſten in this ſenſe. Yea Gregorie himſelfe de

And repeating the ſame againe, Expoſuimus quemadmodum honor Sanctis, non per virtutem relligionis proximè, ſed per aliam LONGE DIVERSAM exhibeatur. So aſhamed is the late Ieſuite, and ponderer of all the circumſtances of this cauſe, to ſtand to relligious worſhipping of creatures, in any ſenſe, though neuer ſo diminutiue. Yet he proceedes in his rage againſt Calvin, to contradict himſelfe after ſo many declarations of his minde.

Ʋt enim eâdem virtute charitatis &c. An euident contradiction out of meere malice to Calvine, not that he repents of his former doctrine. For if there is to be maximum & reale diſcrimen, between our worſhip of God, and of the creatures, and, LONGE DIVERSA VIRTVS, which applies vs to them both, &c. how can it be without Gods great diſhonour, to giue the creature his worſhip, or the creatures to him? But what maruaile, when he will haue vs loue God and our neighbour with the like, yea the SAME charitie? Which is not to be graunted, ſaue ſo farre forth as the name is the ſame, but the thing moſt diuers. Yet this

is his doubtie inſtance of this matter. Will you heare what S. Auſten ſaies in other places hereof? Lib. 20. contra Fauſtum, c. 5. Solus ille colendus, quo ſolo fruens beatus fit cultor eius, & quo ſolo non fruens omnis mens miſera eſt, etſi qualibet re aliâ perfruatur. That is, He onely is to be worſhipped, (namely relligiouſly,) in the fruition of whome ſtands the bleſſednes of the worſhipper, and by want of whome alone, each ſoule turnes miſerable, though it plentifully enioy all things beſides. Are Saints ſuch? Are Angels ſuch? or is any creature in the world ſuch? Yet you tell vs moſt abſurdly of a diuine cult, Numb. 26. (for ſo cult you are, or ſo quilted in your tearmes) as if there were an inferiour and humane anſwering to it. S. Auſten knowes no colere here, and therefore no adorare, of ought elſe ſaue God onely, in whoſe fruition alone conſiſts our bleſſednes, and not in the fruition of one another. And of Martyrs more plainly in the ſame booke, cap. 21. (for Fauſtus it ſeemes vrged him with the Chriſtian practiſe, which might be ſtragling in ſome few, but ſurely Catholique in the maine, as he complaines in the ſame place, that the godly of his age are compeld to beare with many things, which they liked not, and yet could not redreſſe, Aliud eſt quod docemus, aliud quod ſuſtinemus) 
                  Sic de moritus Eccl. c. 34. &c. I ſay, of Martyrs, he thus profeſſeth: Colimus Martyres, ſed eo cultu quo in hac vitâ coluntur Sancti homines. That is, We worſhip Martyrs, but with ſuch a kind of worſhip, as holy men are worſhipped with, during this life, that is, during their mortalitie, during their corruption, and that Heb. 12. 1. ſame faſt-cleauing ſinnefulnes; which is wonder if it ſhould ſtretch ſo farre, as to relligious adoration of men, not onely frayle, but alſo faultie, and obnoxious.

So as, firſt, worſhipping God, we ſhall worſhip him in diſparitie, and in inequalitie, as if there were any thing in God to be worſhipt leſſe then another, and not all to be worſhipt after the moſt excellent faſhion that we can. Yea by this meanes, we ſhall worſhip God with the worſhip of the creature, namely by dulia, if your diſtinction ſay true, which how can you thinke conuenient, I pray you? For if God, as the creature, then the creature as God. Why not? Though it is worſe to abaſe God, then to exalt the creature, and yet both moſt dangerous.  Laſtly, we muſt either  bring in many Lords into the world, contrarie to that, Eph. 4. 5. vnus Dominus, likewiſe Iſa. 42. 8. 1. Cor. 8. 6. or elſe your dulia muſt come to nothing. I haſt to an ende.
               § 15. You reſt not ſatisfied with the Biſhops anſwer, to thoſe words of S. Ambroſe, Crux Chriſti in regibus adoratur, 
                  De obit. Theodoſ.
                   
                  the croſſe of Chriſt is adored in Kings: that, if the croſſe of Chriſt be adored in Kings, then with the ſame adoration that Kings are, which is not ſpirituall, nor relligious. What can you find fault with in this anſwer? For if the croſſe with one adoration, and the King with another, be to be adored, it had beene more for the commendation of the croſſe, to haue ſaide, we worſhip it whereſoeuer, euen in the beggarlieſt creatures, where no cauſe els appeares of worſhipping. But becauſe it is true, that when we giue honour to the King, we honour per accidens all that he is adorned with, for ſo much as the

Emperours abhorred not the monument of the croſſe in their attires, S. Ambroſe ſhewes how much it hath gained by their conuerſion, namely to be honoured alike with thē, yet ciuilly ſtill, and not relligiouſly. So S. Auſten, as I remember, Contra Fauſt. Manich. Sed & contrà Creſe. Grammat. Grammat. 2. c. 15. Honoramus Sacramenta in geſtante. ſaith, the Sacrament either of Baptiſme, or Circumciſion, is worſhipt in the partaker, adoratur in geſtante; there the man for the ſacrament, here the thing for the mans ſake that carried it about him, winnes honour and reſpect: but how? Sicut ipſa incircumciſio in allophylo ſpernebatur, as the want of the ſacrament was deſpiſed in a forrreyner. Yet none euer worſhipt the ſacrament of Baptiſme relligiouſly (and much leſſe circumciſion) as you would haue vs to doe your croſſe, or your woodden images, though we acknowledge the worth of Gods inſtitution, whereſoeuer we finde it. So as neither ciuill is relligious firſt, nor all adoration the adoration that you ſtriue for, but an honourable eſteeme, nor the croſſe the croſſe, by S. Hieroms expoſition, as you ſhall heare anone. As for deferre redemptioni, which you ſay followes immediately in S. Ambroſe, to honour our redemption, that is it that we pleade for, and we doe that without adoring either wood or picture, yet excited happily by occurring memorialls and aduertiſements whatſoeuer. As S. Auſten acknowledgeth, that ab admonitu locorum we thinke of the Saints, and endeauour the imitation of them ſo much the more zealouſly, when we but come into their Churches (I meane Churches called by their names, not otherwiſe) lib. 20. contra Fauſt. c. 21. How much more then, are we rauiſhed with the admiration of our Sauiour, conſidering the very inſtrument vpon which he dyed for vs? So Helen, when ſhee had found, not the ſigne of The Adioynd. of Helen, numb. 29. the croſſe, but the very croſſe it ſelfe, or the remainders thereof, S. Ambroſe carefully prouides his ſpell, as I may ſay, to exempt her from blame, that, non vti
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      lignum, ſhe Vbi priùs. adored not the wood, which is a heatheniſh paſſion, and the vanity of the wicked, ſaith he. And if ſhe worſhipt not the wood, ſhe worſhipt nothing of the croſſe that ſhe found in Paleſtine,

which was all of wood, but her Sauiour, and her redeemer, by that occaſion liuely brought to her remembrance, him ſhe worſhipped. Euen ſo they that approached the Emperour in his Court, with the croſſe in his garments, from thence they roſe to thinke of their redemption. In other caſes you may diſtinguiſh betweene lignum (as you are wont) and forma Sancti, or Sanctae, in ligno, but here if not lignum, nothing but redemptorem, and ſeruatorem, without queſtion. But not lignum, ſaith S. Ambroſe, that is the Pagans errour, therefore not ferrum they, nor any ſuch materiall, whether in boſſe, or bridle, or in the kings crowne. Ego crucem dico, non lignum, ſed paſſionem, ſaith S. Hierome, in Pſal. 46. I by the croſſe vnderſtand Chriſts ſuffering. And when I profeſſe to worſhip the one, I meane my affection and deuotion to the other. And yet you quote a freſh teſtimony of S. Hierome, vncited by the Cardinall, ſaying that Apolog 2. adverſ. Ruff.
                   he adored the cradle and the cratch, comming to Bethleem. No doubt as he did the aſhes of Abdias before, in his viſitation of the holy places, or as they did in whoſe perſon he there ſpeakes. Was our Sauiours cratch (for cradle he had none) or Abdias aſhes, remaining, thinke you, till then? As for admonitus locorum, as S. Auſten ſpeaks, the place was not ſo ruinous, but it might put him in minde of who had beene there ſometime. Yet you neuer ſo much as mention this explanation of S. Hieroms, concerning the croſſe, to vnderſtand the paſſion by it, which the Biſhop alleadgeth, whom neuertheles you may accuſe for leauing out whole periods, and taking no notice of principall arguments, of which we are now to conſider in the ſecond place.
               § 16.  A Second kinde of challenge then, you make to the Biſhop, for not printing all his aduerſaries words, but ſuppreſſing ſomewhat of that which was forcible. And you deſcant merrily, that happily it might be for lacke of roome in the margent, or ſome ſuch cauſe. But what would you ſay, if he

printed none at all, as few doe, and as the faſhion is, or but very ſieldome, now adayes? though I haue ſcarcely ſeene a booke that hath ſo much printed of his aduerſaries text, eſpecially in the margent, vnleſſe it contained all, without any contractions. Is there no refutation vnleſſe all be ſpoken to? what end may we then looke for? But at leaſt you ſhould haue performed this your ſelfe, afore you taxed others, who of all writers are ſimply the fartheſt off from it, not excepting your collegue that lately raged againſt the Biſhop in like ſort, as you doe now. And if no body had flewen vpon the Biſhops booke, but he which had peruſed and confuted it, by peecemeale, omitting nothing, the firſt ſtone had not yet beene caſt at it, nor I thinke euer would be caſt, the moſt of it being ſuch ſtone-worke, as no leſſe impregnable to your confutation, then rocke and flint to your digeſtion. But I pray let vs heare this ſame notable argument, which dropt thorough the ſieue, when his fellowes ſtayd behind. You ſay the Biſhops argument, about the couering of ſinnes, hath beene an hundred times anſwered, (in your Numb. 25.) I beleeue, this no leſſe then a thouſand. And indeede how little pertinent was it to the grand queſtion, viz. his Maieſties challenge of fiue hundred yeares? and then how looſely, how wretchedly doth it hang together? As thus, That becauſe Adam fills vs full of ſinnes, as ſoone 
                  The Card, inferreth with the bleſſed Apoſtle, that ſeeing the ſinne of Adam was of force to make vs truly ſinners, the merits and grace of Chriſt are of farre greater force, to purge and cleanſe vs from our ſinnes, and to make vs truly iuſt: otherwiſe our helpe is not equiualent to our harme, our remedy to our diſeaſe, our riſing to our fall, nor our gaine to our loſſe, nor conſequently Chriſt to Adam, &c. The Adioynders clo quence, numb. 40. 
                  as we are borne, therefore the gift of regeneration, which we haue by Chriſt, repleniſhes vs as ſuddenly with all manner of righteouſneſſe, and euacuates in vs the bodie of ſinne. Is it not pitty this Achilles ſhould haue beene paſt ouer in ſilence? Which the eares of our Sophiſters euery day ring with, and the ſchooles, Churches, ſtreets, with the anſwer of it. Againe, that Adam conueied inherent corruption to vs, therefore the righteouſneſſe that we haue by Chriſt is more then imputatiue. As if firſt we denied the riches of Chriſts grace, to be plentifully To the 2.
                  
inherent in the ſoules of his Saints, as faith, as temperance, as patience, as charitablenes, &c. Ibunt de virtute in virtutem: though the maine by which we hold, and by which we are ſaued, is not our owne ſtrength, or our owne vertue, but the ſufficiency onely inherent 
                     Pronihilo ſalvos facies eos; which conſtruction of the Fathers in this ſenſe, (though deflected) Andradius himſelfe miſlikes not, but erounds a rule vpon it for the like expoſitions.

                   in the perſon of our Redeemer, which queſtionleſſe is made ours, becauſe interpreted to be ours, by the fathers gracious acceptance, as if our ſelues were poſſeſſed of it, which is that terrible imputation, that you are ſo ſtartled with. As if our Lord had not plainely ſaid in S. Iohns Goſpel, drawing towards his death, Ego pro ijs Sanctifico me; I ſanctifie my ſelfe for them, ſhewing that both in life and death he wrought for vs, he ſerued our turne, and not his owne. For euen in this ſenſe alſo, he came to ſerue and not to be ſerued. But if this be your skill in the principles of Diuinity, as not to vnderſtand how Chriſt both ſaues vs by

                   imputation, and yet powres vpon vs the gifts of his holy ſpirit really, howſoeuer abated by our in-dwelling corruption, and therefore not of ability to protect vs in the day of iudgement, I may doubt alſo whether you be perfect in Adams caſe, vpon which you ground your argument, whoſe very act of eating the forbidden fruit, is ſo ours, (ſaith S.

But I haue ſtood too lōg vpon ſo trifling an obiection, ſpecially ſince the Apoſtle neuer compares them in this point, in his 5. to the Rom. which you here quote, I meane the one in miniſtring righteouſneſſe,

as much as the other doth ſinne, and that preſently, but either grace anſwerable to former treſpaſſes, which grace is in remitting, not onely in repleniſhing; in forgiuing, not onely in infuſing; or the number of the one people, with the number of the other, that belong to each roote, viz. Adam and Chriſt, (where by the way you tell vs, numb. 39. your Latine tranſlation ſaith, Plures per Chriſtum quàm per Adamum, more are reſtored by Chriſt, then are periſhed in Adam, which were worth the knowing how:) or laſtly, that in the ſubſtance of their gift they may be equalled, though the remedie come halting after the offence in time, like Lite after Ate.

Paul, touching himſelfe, Hymenaeus & Philetus proudly gaue out that the reſurrectiō was alreadie paſt, viz. on their ſides, as if they had been at the top of the ladder of perfection, much like to that which the Ieſuites dreame of now a dayes emong themſelues.

Auſten ſpeaks, peccatum regnans beeing one thing, and peccatum inhabitans another, and the Iebuſite not ſo eaſily turned out of dores, to vſe S. Bernards allegorie. Yet moſt Vbi priùs. pittifully you quote the Cardinall, ſaying, that it is Chriſts diſgrace, if he could not truly and properly purge, or make cleane thoſe, that are borne againe in him. As if it were for want of power in Chriſt, that wee are not ſuddenly perfited, that the Iebuſite is not caſt out vpon the ſuddaine. Whereas rather his power is perfected in weaknes, and, his Grace is ſufficient for vs: and as God would not ſuddenly caſt out all the inhabitants of the land of Canaan before the children of Iſrael, Ioſh. 17. becauſe they were not enow to empeople the Countrey, thinking it the more eaſie affliction of the two, that they

ſhould be encombred with enemies, then ouer-run with wild beaſts; ſo here to keepe out pride, like a wild beaſt, and to exerciſe vs with daily ſtrugling againſt concupiſcence our enemie, (our foe, the fomes) Almightie God hath deferred to worke a perfect regeneration of vs, though he hath granted from the beginning a perfect remiſſiō, which is your monſtrous error, not to diſtinguiſh betweene remitting and remoouing faults, betweene releaſing them and rooting them cleane out.
               § 18. The like I ſay to your quotations out of Eſay, and diuers other Prophets, Numb. 36. namely, that the iniquitie of Gods people ſhall be taken away, wiped, or blotted out, aboliſhed like a cloud, like a dew, like a myſt, that our ſinnes ſhall be buried in the bottome of the ſea, that he hath remooued them as farre from vs as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, that our ſinne ſhall be ſought and not be found, with many the like: Quoad reatum nimirum, not quoad vitium, in regard of the guilt, not in regard of the fault, of the ſtaine, of the corruption, which hath taken deepe rooting in mortalitie, and is not pulled out, but with Cor ipſum eum cupiditatibus evellendum. Sen.
                   our very heart. We reuolue all theſe ſentences, with vnſpeakable comfort, for ſecuring of our conſcience againſt the houre of tentation, though we dare not waxe inſolent, becauſe of the ſenſe of our infirmitie, continuing in vs, that we can not doe as we would, Gal. 5. 17. and for that no good thing dwelleth in our fleſh, and, we ſee a law of ſinne in our members, rebelling againſt the law of our minde, yea and leading vs captiue to the law of ſinne, Rom. 7. But, cùm venerit quod perfectum eſt, abolebitur quod imperfectum, and when this mortalitie ſhall put on immortalitie, and our corruptible be cloathed with incorruption, when we ſhall ſee him as he is, and be ſatisfied with his likenes, then it will be otherwiſe with vs. You in the meane time are all for the preſent, as if the Hieruſalem were on earth which comes downe from heauen, and is not readie for her husband yet, but yet is making readie daily. For when you bring in that among the reſt, that ſinnes like skarlet ſhall be made as white as ſnow, you

muſt beware how you ſtretch it too farre, beyond the ſenſe, though you are a partiall friend to the Cardinalls skarlet, whoſe cauſe you plead, and which perhaps you looke to inherit one day: neither thinke that ſinnes ſhall euer turne ſo white, as to become vertues, but the indulgence of a father, forgiuing all that is amiſſe, turnes skarlet to ſnow, into innocence guiltines. And that is by not imputing, not by cleane aboliſhing. So Dauids, Waſh, yea waſh me more and more, makes more and more againſt your ſelfe, when you quote it moſt: for this ſhewes, that we are neuer waſhed cleane enough whiles we liue here, but though God hath begun to make a renouation in vs, yet ſtill we crie, and haue cauſe to crie with Dauid, O Lord waſh me yet more and more. Whereunto if one ſhould obiect, as you are not very forward, that, Qui Iotus eſt, non habet opus niſi vt pedes lauet, &c. although that may ſeeme to ſet out the ſinglenes of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, which without horrible ſacriledge cannot be reiterated, yet applying it to the daily defunctions of our penitence, we may anſwer briefly, that we are totipedes, more feet and more ſoyle then a man would thinke. As for your numb. 37. where you heape as many places out of the new Teſtament (as before out of the old,) teſtifying that Chriſt hath purged our ſinnes, purified our hearts, cancelled our debts, killed enmities, exhauſted corruptions, that we might be holy, immaculate, and irreprehenſible before him, &c. This is firſt true in the Saints that are in heauen, who haue ſhaken of this yoke of woefull bondage, and in regard of our Sauiour it is true de merito, concerning vs too, their vnhappy ſuruiuers, though our indiſpoſition delay the complementum of it, for which we ſigh, and groane, and waite, and attend, though our eyes waſt with looking for his ſaluation. O Lord I haue looked for thy ſaluation, ſaith the Patriarch, euen when he was ready to dye. So happy are they, to whome, I ſay not in ſenectute, but in morte contigerit huc aſpirare, as he ſaies; Cui ſuſpiramus ſemper. Where you ſay that no guile muſt be in the ſpirit, Pſal. 32. 2. and therefore ſinne is cleane purged in

the iuſt, you are to know that all ſinne is not guile, but the ſinne of hypocriſie, diſſembling our ſinnefulneſſe, and reioycing ſiniſterly in our ſuppoſed perfection, of which let them take heede that dance to your pipe, and delight in your doctrine. The Pſalme oppoſeth it there to dum tacui in the next verſe, v. 3. for where there is tacui, there is guile, where no guile no tacui. And the Saints in the Reuelation had no guile found in their mouthes, becauſe they confeſſed they were ſinners, ſath S. Auſten.
               
               § 19.  ANother fault of the Biſhops, is here complained  of, that he hath not layd downe at full the Cardinals argument, out of the Epiſtle of Theodoſius to the Councell of Epheſus, by which is ſhewed who ſhould be preſent at generall Councells. And I hope it is no matter, whether he lay it downe at length or no, ſo he anſwer it. But you that vndertake the refutation of the Biſhops anſwer to the Cardinalls Apologie, why doe you mention but one part of his anſwer to this very argument? Is not this a worſe fault, and yet in the ſame kinde? As for example, one part of the Biſhops anſwer was this, that a Count and a King be not all one, and when Theodoſius forbad the Count to meddle, he precluded not himſelfe. This you mention, but the reſt you leaue out. Firſt, that it appeares Theodoſius did not ſet this law to himſelfe, to be no medler in Councels, becauſe he aſſembled it, yea confirmed it, and ratified the Acts of it, which Count Candidian might not doe. Secondly, that the Emperour exhorted this noble Courtier and Count Candidian, to ſuppreſſe them that were at oddes, and to curbe the humour of ſuch as loued iangling. Could this be without his interpoſing in their tractate, which are the words that you ſtand vpon? Can 69. of approching the Altar. And you ſhall finde in the Trullan Councell, that other lay-men are forbidden that thing, the libertie whereof is reſerued to the Emperour notwithſtanding. So might it be here. And indeede who would euer retort vpon a King out of his owne words, or bind Theodoſius as it were with

his owne girdle, ſo with his owne Epiſtle, This is like the woman-philoſophers elench, apud Laert. l. 8. in Hipparch.

                  Euſebius, nay Biſhop ouer Biſhops, that is the oecumenicall Biſhop, which you would be glad if your Pope had the like plea for himſelfe, to intermeddle with the matters of Conſtantine, and of the Empire. Why then might not Theodoſius? Or though onely Biſhops, as you would faine force, may haue to doe in Councels, yet why ſhould Theodoſius or Conſtantine ſit out, that are Biſhops without the Church, as others are within, and during diuine ſeruice? See Sozom. l. 4. c. 21. of Leonas and Laritius, two lay-Courtiers, one ſatelles aulae, another praefectus militum, as the author ſtyles them, ſent to the Councell of Seleucia in Iſauria, de mandato Conſtantij, by Conſtantius his commandement, that in their preſence de fide accuratè inquireretur, ſtrict enquiry might be made of Faith. And when ſome Biſhops would not enter into diſputation about things controuerted, becauſe of the abſence of other, Leonas tamen iuſſit de fide diſceptari, Leonas neuertheleſſe commanded them to conferre about relligion. In the Councell of Syrmium, the Emperour likewiſe appointed Iudges preſident of his owne pallace, doctrinâ & auctoritate caeteris praeſtantes, in all likelihood but lay-men. Idem Sozom. lib. 4. c. 5. And cap. 13. of the ſame booke, Conſtantius letter to the Church of Antioch, and the Biſhops there aſſembled, conteines thus; Placet prohibere à conventibus Eccleſiaſticis, It is our pleaſure to forbid certaine from Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies. You may ſay now, if you will after all this, that Emperours haue nothing to doe in Councels, and that Theodoſius meant to barre himſelfe by his owne letter, or elſe that he knewe not the right which Conſtantius exerciſed, and was deſcended to him by ſucceſſion euen from Conſtantine.
                  
But there is a letter of Theodoſ. and Valentinian, ioyntly extant in the Acts of the Epheſine Councell, the 3. in number, in Surius his edition, beginning thus, Praeclariſſimo Comiti, &c. Which you may doe well to read, to ſee what lay Emperours may doe in Councells. You ſhall ſee how he checks the whole Councell there, for there partiality and part-taking, for their tumults and ſicut non conueniebat, and how he concludes the matter, Quapropter Maieſtati noſtrae viſum eſt, vt huiuſmodi authoritas nullo pacto locum habeat, & quae inordinatè ſunt geſta caſſentur. Wherefore it ſeemed good to our Maieſtie, that ſuch authority ſhould by no meanes take place, and that thoſe things be abrogated or diſanulled, which were diſorderly done. Yea how he tyes the Biſhops to their reſidence at the Councell, forbidding any to depart, and how he ſets an Oportet vpon omnia corroboranda ſunt à noſtrâ pietate, and laſtly how he ends moſt imperially and worthily, Maieſtas noſtra nō hominum aliquorum, ſed ipſius doctrinae ac veritatis curam gerit! Our Maieſtie takes not care of mens perſons, but of (Gods) truth, and the [heauenly] doctrine. The like he doth in the Epiſtle that you quote, and namely chargeth them to heare no accuſations, but proceede to diſcuſſion of faith onely.

Which many a man (to ſay truth) is loath to doe, I meane to detract any thing from the credit of the reporter, euen then when he ſcarce beleeues that which is told. As for the aſſiſtance of Angels, or apparition of Saints, it prooues not that it is lawfull for vs to pray to them (as hath been ſhewed before) and therefore it matters not greatly whether

that of Felix be true or no. Sure it is, that S. Auſten in the ſame booke where he tells this, de curâ promortuis, argues from the ſaying of holy Scripture, Abraham hath not knowne vs, nor Iſrael, &c. that Saints departed are ignorant, if not careleſſe, or forgetfull, of our ſtate here.

But is not that prettie, numb. 44. that though the Saints appeare not in their owne perſons, yet the apparition may well be called theirs, viz. becauſe Angels appeare for them, in their name and likenes? as if the Deuill did not counterfeit their name and likenes too, and therefore he appearing, they may be ſaid to appeare, as well as when the Angels, by this reaſon. Yet moſt ridiculouſly you adde, that Angels appeare for the Saints merits, and ſo the Angels apparition is the Saints apparition. But firſt, we haue told you our mind about merits, in the former part of this booke, which if any were in this life, yet none in the other, none in patriâ, where the Saints are. They haue done meriting, and yet to merit for others, is more abominable then for ones ſelfe; but for men to merit, that Angels ſhould come, and doe offices in their name, is moſt abſurd of all, and therefore worthie of F. T. whatſoeuer he is. At laſt, you graunt in the ſame Numb. that not onely Saints may appeare in the ſhape of Angels, but God himſelfe hath done ſo de facto, as Gen. 18. Exod. 3. to Abraham, and to Moſes. Yet, afore you ſaide, that the Angel whome Abraham worſhipt, was a created Angel, numb. 14. How does this hang together? As for that you enterlace, that no ſhape can repreſent

God, it is ſo true, that S. Iſidore, vpon Exod. 3. ſaies, God appeared to Moſes, in rubo, in a buſh, becauſe the buſh is vnfitteſt of all ſhrubs to be grauen or made an image 
                  2. Cor. 4. 4. Chriſt is the image of the inuiſible God. As who would ſay, No image of God (becauſe inuiſible) but onely Chriſt. In him we ſee God. 
                  of. But then, how doe you not tremble, to haue images in your Churches, and images of God? Whereas the Councell in Trullo, Canone 83. forbids Chriſt to be painted in the forme of a lambe, which is farre more tolerable then the holy Ghoſt like a doue.

                     This fault is called by the Adioynder, The Biſhops abuſe of Authors, partly in wreſting their ſenſe, partly in fraudulent citation of them.

Inſtitut. c. 14. as they lie in Bellarmine, your other ſelfe (I and the Cardinall, or els it is no bargaine) where you leaue out the Paragraph, or the ſection of the chapter, to hide your craft the more, you clippe off thoſe words alſo (words of moment) ſi in ſe cenſeantur: and onely ſay, that, no worke can paſſe from holy men, by Calvins verdict, which doth not deſerue the iuſt reward of ſhame. True, Sir, if you take in all that Calvine ſaies, namely, if it be weighed ſtrictly, rigorouſly, and in it ſelfe, without any ouerſhadowing of the diuine pittie. Si in ſe cenſeantur. Refute this, if you can. In the meane time you alleadge the author corruptly, which is the thing that you declaime againſt; ſtealing, and crying out againſt theft both at one time.
               § 22. What miſlikes you in the Biſhops antitheſis, that he makes to the Cardinals diſputation about the iuſtice of workes? I beleeue nothing more then that you cannot brooke it, and yet know not how to put it off.

And if that be true, which here you pretend, that when we teach that the forme of our iuſtification before God, ſtands in his free mercie, not imputing our ſinnes to vs, we take away all vſe of a future iudgement, by conſequence of that doctrine, doth not the Biſhop as truly, and moſt pithily, retort, that if you can be iuſtified by your workes here, you may as well alſo forbeare any other iudgement? Howe does the firſt of theſe, euacuate the iudgement, which wee beleeue in the Creede, more then the ſecond? Or why ſhould not a iudgement be held for this cauſe, as well that it may be ſeene and made knowne to the whole world, whome God hath acquitted and whom not, to whom he imputes their ſinnes, and to whom not, who haue layd hold vpon him by faith & who not, as who haue kept the law, wrought righteouſnes, fulfilled the commandements, and who not?

And though you haue this trick by your ſelfe, cleane differing from the faſhion of all other writers, that euer I read, to repeat, and reiterate, and reſing your owne glories; yet we, non habentes talem conſuetudinem, thus paſſe on.
               § 24. Epiphanius, you ſay, neuer reprehended praying to the 
                  Haereſ 77. apud Epiph. quae Collyridian.
                   
                  
                     Ʋirgin Marie, but ſacrifice onely in the Collyridian goſſips. And was their ſacrifice without prayer? or could it well bee?

Remember I pray, your owne principles: then ſhew where Epiphanius, reproouing the ſacrifice, excepts praying, and condemnes not all their fopperie in groſſe. Yet he ſcannes the point nicely, and ſhewes what we may giue to the Virgin without offence, what we may not, in all which, of prayer not a word that he vouchſafes her. What maruaile, when he acknowledges ſuch vertue in prayer, in compariſon of ſacrifice, that he ſaies elſewhere, the ſacrifice of prayer, turned 
                  Anchorato. 
                  the old Teſtament into the new, euen before the Goſpel. At leaſt therefore now, prayer and praiſe, is our beſt ſacrifice, vnder the new Teſtament, and not to bee affoarded to any but God. But becauſe when you ſtand for the inuocation of Saints, you denie not but it is an act of the adoration belonging to them, and referre it to the cult that you ſo fooliſhly talked of not long before, you ſhall heare how often Epiphanius debarreth all adoration from the Virgin, in the treatiſe afore-named, againſt the womans hereſie (for ſo alſo he Totum hoc mulieris opinio eſt. And Hi enim qui hoc docent, quinam ſunt praeterquam multeres? tearmeth it) neuer adiudging any adoration to her, of what kind ſoeuer, neuer prayers, and much leſſe praying to her there himſelf, though he ſhut vp that diſcourſe Pergamus deum inuocantes vt opituletur, quò veritatis partes inveſtigemus, &c. And in like ſort he had begun, Pro viribus deum inuocantes contra hanc haereſim dicemus. And, Vt quorundam rabiem in Deo exoluere poſſimus, &c. with a praier to God, not ſo much as mentioning her. Firſt, condemning the worſhipping of Saints, & the vſe of images, both in one, and making the deuil to be the author of both. Vnde non eſt ſimulachrificū hoc ſtudium, & diabolicus conatus? [How can this be but an idolous peice of work, or a deuilliſh attempt?] Praetextu enim iuſtitiae ſemper ſubiens hominum mentem diabolus, mortalem naturam in hominum oculis deificans, ſtatuas humanas imagines prae ſe ferentes per artium varietatem expreſſit: [For the deuill alway creeping into mens minds, vnder the colour of righteouſnes, deifying the frayle nature in the eyes of men, hath framed images reſembling mens countenances, by diuerſitie of skill, &c.] Et mortui quidem ſunt qui adorantur, ipſorum verò imagines quae 
                  The dead not to be worſhipped. 
                  nunquam vixerunt adorandas introducunt, adulterante mente ab vno & ſolo deo, velut commune ſcortum, &c. [And (firſt) they

are dead men whome they worſhip (which ſhould not be:) Much leſſe images either of dead or liuing. (ſecondly) they bring in their images (inferiour to the dead parties themſelues) which are not dead indeede, and good cauſe why, becauſe they neuer were aliue, and nothing can die, but that which once liued.] By which we ſee, that Epiphanius would haue that onely to be adored, which (firſt) liueth, and (ſecondly) dieth not, or cannot die againe. Such as onely God is, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, who onely hath immortalitie; neither Saint, nor Angel, in that ſort. Then follow his tearmes of deteſtation of this practiſe, that the mind by ſo doing, runnes a whoring from the one and onely God (onely God therfore is the obiect of chaſt worſhippers) like a common harlot, that hath out-liued all honeſtie, and keeping of truſt in wedlocke, itching and tickling after innumerable enormities of diuers luſtfulnes, &c. (which is notably to be ſeene in the Romiſh Church this day, who leauing God, and declining to creatures, could keepe no hoe, no meaſure, in their miſdemeanours.) But (as if one had obiected, what is this to the Virgin Marie, and the worſhipping of her? for ſhe is not euery bodie; Is adoration Whereas Epiphan. in all this tract, dwelleth ſo much vpon thoſe words, ſpeaking of B. Marie, Non eſt Deus, ſhe is no God, it is a greater abatement of her honour, then perhaps the Pap. will graunt, who will eaſily ſay, that they hold her not for God, (thongh ſome of them haue called her ſo, euen lately) and it may be expounded by that of Dionyſ. in Epiſt. 4. ad Caium Monachum, Ieſus ne homo quidem erat, non quòd non eſſet homo, ſed quòd homines longè ſuperaret. The Virgin is denied to be God therfore, as not ſo highly Superiour, no not to men. proper to none but God?) Epiphanius therefore addes, confirming our aſſertion; Reverà, Sanctum erat corpus Mariae, non tamen deus, Revera virgo erat ipſa virgo, & honorata, ſed non ad adorationem nobis data, ſed ipſa adorans, &c. That is, No doubt the bodie of Marie was holy (he calls her Marie ſtill, as Hieron. ad Theodoram v. duam de morte Lucini Betici mariti ſui: & addit, Confundatur hareſti quae ideo incerta & magna promittit (to the Saints no doubt) vt quae certa & moderata ſunt auferat. S. Hierome in the like caſe, Let them know, ſaith he, Mariam Mariam, that Marie is but Marie) her bodie was holy, but [ſhee was] no god: no doubt the

To the end that ſome might not thinke that the holy Virgin was more excellent, he called her [barely] woman, as it were foreſhewing what ſhould happen in the world by way of ſects and hereſies [concerning her] that ſome through too great admiration of that holy [woman] might not ſlide into this hereſie, and the dotage thereof. For in very truth, all this whole paſſage, is nothing but a meere mockerie, and a toy, and an old wiues tale, &c.] Then, Quae verò ſcriptura de hoc narravit? Quis Prophetarum praecepit hominem adorari, nedum mulierem? That is, [And I pray what Scripture informeth vs hereof? Which of the Prophets commanded any man to be worſhipped, and if not a man, much leſſe a woman?] See you how he reduceth this controuerſie to Scripture? yet the Adioynd. makes no reckning of ſcripture

Well; it was lawfull for Epiphanius to flie to that, Quae verò Scriptura? And, Quis Prophetarum praecepit, &c? See you alſo how he preferres not a few before the Virgin? For, we muſt not worſhip man, ſaith he, and much leſſe a woman, belike though it be the Virgin her ſelfe. Eximium quidem eſt vas, ſed mulier, & nihil à naturâ immutata. That is; [An excellent veſſell ſhe is no doubt, but yet a woman, and not a whit changed in regard of her nature.] Further, Honoured ſhe is, but as the bodies are of the Saints, and if I may ſay any more towards the magnifying of her, ſicut Elias, ſicut Iohannes, ſicut Thecla, Like Elias, like Iohn, like Thecla. Onely

herein (ſaith Epiphan.) more honourable then Thecla, that ſhe was employed to be the inſtrument of the myſterious birth of our Lord. But ſuppoſe ſhe be like onely to other Saints, may not they be worſhipped? Epiphanius proceedes. Sed neque Elias adorandus eſt, etiamſi in vivis ſit, neque Iohannes adorandus, neque Thecla, neque quiſquam Sanctus adoratur. Not onely no dead Saint, but not ſo much as they that neuer died, may be adored. (This, though we ſhould The Virgin not aſſumed in Epiphan. opinion. Where I cannot but exemplifit the

Neither Elias is to be adored, nor Iohn to be adored, nor Thecla, nor any Saint is to be adored. Was it not poſſible, that Epiph. ſhould light vpon your diſtinction of diminutiue adoration, that ſo often, ſo peremptorie, denies it to the Saints, that it is lawfull to adore them, and neuer comes in and expounds himſelfe? Non enim dominabitur nobis antiquus error, vt relinquamus viuentē, & adoremus ea quae ab ipſo facto ſunt. [For we will not be ouerruled with the auncient error, that we ſhould leaue the liuing [God,] and worſhip the things which he hath made.] Firſt, errors though auncient, ſhall not ouerrule Epiphanius; nor antiquitie therefore if it be erroneous. Secondly, olde errors are olde errors ſtill, with Epiphanius, though new ſcoured, and new whetted, as this by the Ieſuits. Laſtly, he will not adore any thing that is factum, that is, any creature, and if he ſhould doe ſo, he thinkes he ſhould relinquere viventem, leaue the liuing God: which conſequence the Ieſuits wil not yeild to at this day, nor no doubt would the Goſſips then in their madde ſeruice, but ſay that they ſtucke conſtant to the liuing God, and yet worſhipt the Virgine, as his notable inſtrument, by a ſubordinate kind of deuotion.

                  the Romane Catholike Church: I ſay though the margent of the booke, thus by many intereſts Popiſh, in the edition, may ſeeme to haue acknowledged no leſſe, then we plead for, by noting as it doth in the ſide of it, Imagines damnatae, that is, Images are here condemned; and againe, Sancti non adorandi, Saints are not to be adored, or worſhipped,  Yet let vs goe on with Epiphanius a ſteppe further. Coluerunt enim & adorarunt creaturam praeter creatorem, &c. It is a treſpaſſe with Epiphanius to worſhip the creature, or to adore the creature, (for he puts both) praeter creatorem, beſide the creator; that is, though you exclude not the worſhip of the Creator, but onely take in the worſhip of the creature. Si enim Angelos adorari non vult, quanto magis eam quae genita eſt ab Anna, &c. non tamen aliter genita eſt praeter hominum naturam, ſed ſicut omnes, ex ſemine viri, & vtero mulieris. Here, here, arrige aures Pamphile. Here you ſhould doe well to liſt a while, you Polyphilus, or rather Pamphilus, of all baſtard Deities. For if (ſaith he) God will not haue the Angels to be worſhipped, how much more wil he not haue her which was borne of Anna, and yet not borne otherwiſe, then the faſhion is, & nature of all mankind, but &c. Two great points aſſoyled by Epiph. in theſe fewe words. One, that the Virgin Marie was not conceiued, nor borne, after extraordinarie manner, as the Ieſuites affirme, but euen as others are, which muſt needes be in ſinne, and in corruption. Another, that ſhee is not ſo exalted in heauen, but inferiour to the Angels, or elſe the conſequence were not good, If not the Angels, much leſſe Mary, or the daughter of Anna. There are yet more clauſes againſt the adoration of the Virgin, in this tract of Epiph. Non tamen vt adoretur virgo. And, Sit in honore Maria, but Pater, & filius, & ſpiritus Sanctus adorentur. Againe, Mariam nemo adoret, non dico mulierem, immo neque virum. And, Deo debetur hoc myſterium. Deleantur quae malè ſcripta ſunt in corde deceptorum. Tollatur ex oculis cupiditas ligni. Conuertatur rurſus figmentum ad Dominum. Ne quis comedat de errore

qui eſt propter Mariam: nam & lignum non erat error, ſed per lignum, &c. So by abuſe of the bleſſed Virgin, creepes in error into the Church. And, Etſi pulchrum eſt lignum, ſed tamen non ad cibum. So, Etſi pulcherrima eſt Maria, & Sancta, & honorata, at non ad adorationem. There are theſe, I ſay, and more ſentences yet, tending that way, but aut hoc ſatis eſt teſtimoniorum (as he was wont to ſay teſtium,) aut ego neſcio quid ſit ſatis. Epiphanius himſelfe ſeemes to be wearie of his owne prolixities. Therefore I will conclude with him. Quò verò non longiùs extendam ſermonem, ſufficiant nobis relata. Maria in honore ſit, Dominus adoretur. Iuſti enim nemini exhibent errorem. Ne

                      ſerui ipſius ad deceptionem. That is, [And that I may prolong my diſcourſe no farther, it ſhall ſuffice to haue ſaid thus much. Let Mary be honoured, but let God be worſhipped or adored. The Saints lead none into errour. God tempts none, nor his ſeruants tempt none to deceiue them.] Meaning, that if viſions or apparitions of Saints, bee brought to prooue the lawfull worſhipping of them, wee ſhould not beleeue them. What bring you next?

Reſponſ. ad Apolog. yet ſuppoſe that all this did but goe to the obiection, as I ſee you take it in to no other purpoſe, neuertheleſſe you might haue found the plaine ſolution thereof, if you had turned but a little further, viz. pag. 182. in ſummo paginae, where the Biſhop both acknowledgeth that which you here oppoſe him with, out

of S. Gregories words, Quintum quoque 
                  
                     Pariter is not aequaliter with S. Gregorie, but as the Adioynder truly Engliſhes it (for lacke of too much Latine perhaps) together with. And it is to be noted, that S. Greg. lib. 3. cp. 37. is eaſily perſwaded by Conſtantius Biſhop of Millan, to paſſe ouer the fift Councell, & quatuor ſolummodo ſynodos laudare. Whereas it had been hard to leaue out one of the 4. Goſpels, for ſcandals ſake. Ergo he held it not in the account, which he doth the other. The Biſhop alleadgeth not onely Gregorie, but Iſidore, who names quatuor Synodos principales, and no more. But of him not a word frō 
                     F. T. becauſe he was not for his carping.

That is, Gregorie reuerenceth and receiueth the 4. firſt Councells, like the fowre Goſpels. The fowre firſt Councells are to him, that foureſquare ſtone, vpon which the building of faith and manners ariſeth. Who although he reuerenceth the fift Councell too [in proportion] yet holds it not in ſo great eſtimation as the others. Theſe are the Biſhops words, are they not? What then haue you brought to confute him by, more then is anſwered in his owne writings? Let me ſpeake vnto you in your owne words here, Num. 63. What more palpable fraud or foolerie can there be, thē to take the obiection out of ones aduerſaries books, and to diſſemble the ſolution, though it be to be found there? And if S.

And what other reaſon doth he alleadge, but becauſe they were all 5. held by generall conſent, giuing euidently to vnderſtand, that a generall Councell lawfully aſſembled, repreſenteth the whole Church of God, and is infallibly guided by the holy Ghoſt.

               § 26. The Kings Supremacy, is not well prooued (you

But wherein failes the proofe out of Deuteronomie? Firſt Moſes gaue no copy of the law to any King in The 1. Exception of the Adioynder. his time, for there were no Kings diuers yeares after. Reſp. Though ſummus Magiſtratus be equiualent to a King, in the Politie that he gouernes whatſoeuer it be, and of Moſes it be ſaid, Erat Rex in iuſtitia, and not onely Iuſtine the Hiſtorian, Deut. 33. ver. 5. and a heathen man, reckons Moſes among the Kings of the people of Iſrael, lib. 36. Hiſt. but the Cardinall himſelfe, de Pontif. Rom. lib. 1. cap. 2. ſaies the ſame, quoting Exod. 32. that, as verus & ſummus princept populi Iudaici, as a true and ſoueraigne prince of the people of the Iewes, he commaunded many thouſands to be put to death in one daie, for the golden calfe, &c. yet what then? Does it not ſhew what right belongs to Kings, when Kings at leaſt ſhould be eſtabliſhed in time to come? Will you allow nothing to Scriptures prouidence, or to Gods fore-ſight? Does not this ſhew rather, that the precept which was giuen for to be obſerued by the Iſraelites diuerſe yeares after came of God, and not of man? And doe not your ſelues argue, out of the ſame bookes of Moſes, that a king is not to be choſen but onely exfratribus, which you are carefull to haue Deut. 17. 15. obſerued, as you would ſeeme at leaſt, euen till this day, though Kings (as you ſay) there were none in Moſes time? What then doe you tell vs, that there were then no Kings? Yea, but this is no more then euery priuate man and woman might be allowed, to haue the copy of the Law at home with them. 
                   I am glad to heare you ſay ſo, I pray God you hold you to your word, and ſuffer Chriſtian people hereafter, both men and women, to haue the copies of the Bible, of the old and new Teſtament, in their priuate houſes. Which you muſt needes doe according to your word here, vnleſſe you will make vs more Iewes, then the Iewes themſelues, and bring

a ſlauery vpon Chriſtians, more then euer they were put to that liued vnder the letter, to take both letter and ſpirit from vs, which will leaſt of all befit you in your encounter with the Biſhop, that charge him with no fault more, nor more often, then that he enclines to Iudaiſme, and holds Iewiſh concluſions about ceremonies, and Circumciſion, and a great deale more of ſuch idle ſtuffe that you trauaile with. I am ſure S. Chryſoſtome vpon the 3. to the Coloſſ. exhorts his people, thoſe of the lay-fort, thus: For I ſpeake (ſaies he) to you of the lay: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, buie you bookes [particularly the Bibles] which are the medicines of your ſoules: 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : No maſter like them. And Thomas Aquinas your iolly Schoole-man, handling the ſame words, by occaſion whereof S. Chryſoſtome was lead to ſay this, namely, That the word of Chriſt ſhould dwell richly, 
                  Coloſſ. 3. 16. 
                  or plentifully in vs, reſolues thus. Aliquibus ſufficit modicum quid de verbo Chriſti, ſed Apoſtolus vult quòd habeamus multum. Ideò dicit, Abundanter. That is, Some men are content with a ſmall portion or pittance, God wot, of the word of Chriſt, (this is not you, nor your church at this day, and that is pittie) but the Apoſtle will haue vs to haue much of it, or a great deale of it. Therefore he ſaith, PLENTIFVLLY. S. Hierom and S. Primaſius, inferre out of the ſame words, that lay-folkes ought to haue the word of God among them, and that non ſolùm ſufficienter, ſed etiam abundanter, not onely ſufficiently, but alſo abundantly, or as the Rhemiſts tranſlate it, as if zealous of good meaſure, to be dealt to theſe poore folkes, (though they meane nothing leſſe) euen aboundantly. So Anſelme vpon certaine other words of the ſame Apoſtle, Eph. 2. 19. You are no more ſtrangers or pilgrimes, but of the houſhold of God, &c. gathers both wittily and godlily, that ideò non erant hoſpites teſtamentorum, (as ſome others had beene, of whome he ſpake before) quia non in tranſitu & receſſu videbant ipſa teſtamenta, ſed aſſiduè morabantur & exercebantur in ijs; that is, that therefore they were no ſtrangers (to God, and his Teſtaments) becauſe they ſaw not his

teſtaments onely at a bluſh, or paſſing by, as you would ſay, but daily they ſtaid vpon them, and were exerciſed in them, &c. This is with Anſelme to be no ſtranger to God, but one of his houſhold, &c. Whereas that vnconſcionable Cardinall of yours, in his Controuerſie about this matter, whether lay-folke ſhould read Scripture, or no, quotes Ioh. 6. to prooue that lay-men haue no right to Scriptures, becauſe the wicked Prieſts ſaid, Populus qui extra eſt, The people which is without, knowes not the law, as if ſtill without, and not yet taken into houſe. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . But this by the way onely, becauſe you ſay it is no more then euery priuate man was allowed among the Iewes, to haue the Bible in his houſe. This at leaſt is more on the Kings ſide, then on the priuate mans, that the King in particular is appointed to haue it, by order from Gods owne mouth, and the Prieſt to yeild it him, yea the King himſelfe to write it out for his owne vſe. It ſhall be (ſaies the text) when he ſitteth vpon the throne of his kingdome, that he ſhall write him a copie of this Law in a booke, out of that which is before the Prieſts, the Leuites. WHEN HE SITTETH VPON HIS THRONE. Doth not this make a diſtinction betweene the Kings, and the lay-mans hauing of the booke, though neither be forbidden it? Or doth it not ſhew, that the King is entruſted with the book, in reference to his gouernment ouer the whole kingdome? For the booke muſt be offered him, when he ſitteth vpon the throne of his kingdome (ſaith the text,) no doubt to diſtinguiſh betweene the ende, for which he, and for which ordinarie men, muſt read the booke, if they read it at all. And what thinke you of that, that the King muſt write himſelfe a copie? Is not this too great paines for a King? Which though I doubt not but we may conſtrue, that the King muſt procure one to write it out for him, as Salomon is ſaid to ſacrifice when the Prieſts ſacrificed by his appointment, and our Sauiour Chriſt to baptize, though he baptized none himſelfe, but onely through his Diſciples, yet firſt it argues a great entruſting of the King with diuine matters,

to let him haue the Bible ſo much at his diſpoſing, as to copie it out by ſuch as he ſhall ſet a worke. Secondly, it giues him a ſecret item to diligence, and to ſtudying of this book, with more then ordinarie carefulnes. And laſtly, as oft as the King changeth, ſo oft (as it may ſeeme) ſhould the Bible be tranſcribed, for the vſe of the Crowne, while the Prieſts and the Leuites are enioyned no ſuch taske, for the making of them perfect. Oleaſter complaines vpon this place, that it is a wonder to ſee how diſſolute Kings are, touching the ſtudie of lawes, not onely Gods lawes, but their owne; whereas your doctrine, if they are prone of themſelues, as wee are all by nature to ſuch reckleſneſſe, driues them headlong, and ſets them going by authoritie. Yea, you threaten them with great penalties, if at any time they doe but preſume the contrarie, as if they paſſed the bounds of their commiſſion, in ſo doing. But I ſuppoſe Oleaſter, when he tooke vp that complaint, was not much acquainted with forreine Kings and Queenes, ſuch as God hath bleſſed our land with ſince, of whome I will ſay nothing in this place, leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to affect flatterie, though it be hard to paſſe ouer in ſilence ſuch an incomparable mirrour as we enioy in this kind at this day, God be thanked, and long, moſt long, may we enioy I pray God. Yet I meruaile that beeing a Portaguiſe,

                   if not originally Spaniſh, Alphonſus King of Arragon, one of his countrey-men, ſhould not come into his minde, who is ſaid to haue writ out the Bible once with his owne hand, in Hebrew (as I take it,) and to haue read it, as I remember, no leſſe then ſixteene times ouer. I think few Kings haue come neerer to this precept of copying the Law, for the literall ſenſe of it, then Alphonſus did, though certenly we are to preſume he was no babe in the vnderſtanding of it neither. But Oleaſter notes further, that from hence in all likelihood that cuſtome

tooke his beginning, that the Kings of Iſrael ſhould be crowned with the booke of the Law in their hand, 1. Chr. 24. which is very remarkeable; and no leſſe then for the King of France to be inueſted in a Deacons habit at his De iuſt. &c. p. 433. 3. coronation, as we are told by Roſſaeus. A third exception. Vt diſcat (ſay you) Deum timere, that hee may learne onely to feare God, and for his priuate inſtruction. As if firſt any thing might well be called priuate in ſo great a Maieſty, or as if the King learning his dutie from the booke of the law, could learne it for himſelfe only, and not for others, his dutie beeing to ſee that others doe their duties, as euery magiſtrates is, and his fearing of God beeing to feare him not only in the courſe of his owne life, but of his whole gouernement. Yet you pleaſe your ſelfe in your queint language, that the prieſt was to be poſſeſſed of a copy of the law, that he might obſerue it punctually for his owne ſelfe. Not onely ſo, Sir, but pungitiuely for others; he was to make others, euen Prieſts and all, to keepe the law, to enforce them, and to conſtraine them, to pricke them and to driue them onward by the edge of his ſword, which he carried neither edgeles, nor in vaine, Rom. 13. no not then; as Ezechias did the Leuits, til he made them offer. Obtulerunt tandem, as it is in the Chronicles, by the Kings inſtigation. S. Auſten warranteth this in diuerſe places, as hath beene told you, but I will alleadge S. Gregory to you now, l. 9. Regiſtri. Epiſt. 60. ad Aldiberium, one of the kings of our Country. Regni ſui vos ipſe faciat eſſe participes, cuius vos fidem in regno recipitis & facitis cuſtodiri: that is, Euen he make you partakers of his kingdome, whoſe faith in yours you both entertaine, and MAKE to be obſerued. The Kings office is not onely cuſtodire, but facere cuſtodiri, as the Biſhop told you, if you had the grace to heare him. The Kings keeping is keeping in Hiphil, like ſpiritus interpellat, for facit interpellare, Rom. 8. Euen as God ſaith in Ezechiel, Faciam vt faciatis; but God by aide, and by diuine inſpiration, the King by terrour, by cenſure, and by feare; yet

thus alſo is that fulfilled, Dij eſtis, whereas our part is Obſecramus vos loco Chriſti, &c. 2. Cor. 5. See Rom. 13. where all the good that is done in a common wealth, is attributed to the King, all the euill is auenged by him. And 1. Tim. 2. 2. exhorting that praiers and ſupplications be made for all men, he inſtanceth onely in Kings, becauſe the Kings courſes haue an vniuerſall influence, and not onely for a quiet and peaceable eſtate, but for a godly and an honeſt, which refutes the Ieſuites, that thinke a Kings care is to extend no farther then bonum politicum, or bonum reip. to preſerue the common-wealth from running to confuſion, from want, from plague, from hoſtility, or ſeditions, not regarding piety. But moſt notably of all, Pſal. 2. not onely the relligion of a priuate common-wealth, but the conuerſion of the whole bodie of the Gentiles, is linked inſeparably with the relligiouſneſſe of Kings. For hauing ſaid in the 8. verſe, I will giue thee the Gentiles, for thine inheritance, he points to the meanes in the 10. and 11. Be wiſe now therefore ô ye Kings, & nunc Reges intelligite. Where & nunc is pregnant 
                     F. T. is full of this diuinitie in his firſt chapter of the Adioynd. to confute the Ieſuites, that thinke the care of Relligion, as it ſhould be in Kings, is expired with the Kings of the old Teſtament. But the Pſal. ſaith, & nunc, propheſying of the conuerſion of the Gentiles vnder the new. And further he bids them ſerue the Lord, whereas Kings (ſaith S. Auguſt.) then ſerue the Lord, when they doe that for Epiſt. 50. the Lord, which none can doe but they that are Kings. But priuate honeſty, or priuate integritie, is that which euery body may looke to and performe for themſelues. Therefore the Kings Office, which Deuteronomy calls him to, is an vniuerſall inſpection. And as the piety of kingdomes dependes of their Kings, as the latter end of the Pſal. ſhewes, that I now quoted, ſo the impiety, and the irreligion of them, is to be referred to none other, as appeares by the beginning The people rage, becauſe the Princes ſtand vp, and take part againſt Chriſt. of it. For whereas he had askt the queſtion, why doe the heathen and the people rage, preſently he addes, or rather anſwers, and giues the cauſe himſelfe, The Kings of

the earth haue conſpired together, and the Rulers taken counſell, &c.
               
               § 27. What now though the Originall copy of the Bible 4. Exception of the Adioynder to the place in Deut. was to remaine with the Prieſt? is it not enough that the King was to haue a true copy, and anſwerable to the Originall in all points? For therefore he was bidde to prouide him a copy, to be written out of the Leuites Originall. But let it be that this makes the Prieſt to be Superiour, ſince you will needes haue it ſo, yet Superiour as Expoſitor, or as Interpreter, if you pleaſe, not as guardian, not as cuſtos.
               
               § 28. Laſtly, the King is bid to be obediēt vnto the Prieſt, 5. Exception of the Adioynd. euen by the lawe it ſelfe, which he was to copy out, as appeares in the ſame chap. v. 10.] I might ſay that the King is not named among thoſe that are enioyned this obedience, and therefore not comprehended. For it muſt be liquidum ius that ſhall binde princes. The Soueraigne is wont to be exempted in ſuch caſes. Let one be free that all the reſt may bee the better ordered. As iura Maieſtatis non ſunt communicanda cum ciuibus, both by Bodines rule and other Polititians, ſo neceſſitates ſubditorū, the taxations of ſubiects muſt not bee enforced vpon Princes, Vnleſſe the King were named therefore, no reaſon to bring him in within the compaſſe of this ſtatute. And yet ſecondly, there is an obedience to counſell, and to aduice, to reſolution, and inſtruction,—
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , not onely to authority. Heſiod. The firſt way the King may bee ſubiect to his ſubiects, and obedient to the Prieſts, if you will needes haue it ſo, but the ſecond way the Prieſt is ſubiect to the King, without all queſtion, and that is it with which Supremacy goes. The Cardinall himſelfe can tell vs ſo, when his fit is ouer, when it is his good day, lib. 1. de Pontif. cap. 6. Ne Aſſuerus quidem

Eſter. 1. that is, King Aſſuerus was not ſubiect to thoſe wiſe men, by whoſe aduice notwithſtanding he managed all affaires. As for matter of execution, or coactiue iuſtice, the Iudge is ioyned in commiſſion with

the Prieſt here, v. 12. And is it poſſible that the King ſhould be an vnderling to the Iudge?
               § 29. That the Biſhop ſhould call Bellarmine dotard, for miſtaking our Engliſh affaires ſo much, ſeemes a matter to you very abuſiue, and intolerable. So as curioſitie is but a light fault with you, though in ſtrange Common-wealths, nor does it yrke you any thing to heare your nation accuſed, which neither hath deſerued ill at your hands, nor is culpable of that which the erring Cardinall laies to her charge. Though S. Paul would not accuſe his owne nation, albeit deſeruing, Act. 28. 19. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : Not as if I had any thing (ſaies he) 
                     Comman vlt. Actor. The ſame Chryſoſt. notes the like of Ioſeph, that being caſt into priſon, &c. he neuer told the Butler, and ſuch others as he found there, of his brethrens malice and crueltie towards him, but concealed domeſticall ſcandals. 
                  to accuſe my nation of. Where S. Chryſoſtome notes moſt excellently, that not onely he accuſed them not, though no doubt he had great cauſe, hauing conſpired to kill him before they either ate or dranke; but inſinuated to the companie, and yet without a lie, that he had nothing at all to accuſe them of. For ſo are his words, Not as if I had any thing to accuſe mine owne nation of. But you renegates, and runnagates, forſakers of the Land, make a trade of ſlaundering your owne natiue countrey, and patronizing the ſlaunderours, as here the Cardinall, and whereas S. Paul with great dexteritie ſhunned the lie, to ſaue his countrymens reputation, you make no conſcience of lying and ſlaundering, to defame yours. And why may not the Cardinall be ſaid to doate? Doth not the Poet ſay, dulce eſt deſipere in loco? Which he did, I trow, when he accepted at laſt the Cardinal-ſhip againſt his will, and after much refuſall, as Eudaemon tells vs.

Doe not the Engliſh Puritanes pray dayly for his Maieſty by the title of ſupreame head and gouernour? Doe they not ſet their hand to it, and ſubſcribe their name? Et voce & mann atteſting to it, leaſt happily you ſhould ſay, vox quidem Iacob, manus autem Eſau. And who are you then to gage hearts, which Hieremy ſayes are vnfaddomable, or to ſearch after ſecrets, which the Deuteronomy bids vs to reſerue to God, and leaues to man onely ſuch things as are manifeſt. Whence is it that you can reckon but of one example among vs all of the Engliſh Clergie, that was cenſured for omitting the aforeſaid title in his prayer, as you enforme? Does it not ſhew that others are of another mind, though this were graunted you to be ſo? And yet there may be cauſe not to mention it in prayer, beſides the want of perſwaſion of the truth of it at the heart. Though for my part I will not beleeue you in this report, which otherwiſe perhaps I ſhould not greatly ſticke at, yet if it be but becauſe it is of your ſuggeſting. That of

the moſt? nay, why not all? For my part, if no other Puritanes were to be found, then ſuch as acknowledge not the kings ſupremacie, euen in terminis, I thinke they would be a very geaſon people to meet with, like pretioſa viſio. 1.

And Biſhop Barlow ſpeakes of the Puritanes, as they were in the Auge, or in the Zenith, in their firſt loue, when their appetites were ſharpeſt, their proceedings hotteſt, not as it hath pleaſed God to qualifie them ſince, and to temper them, qui reuelat etiam ſi quis aliter ſapit, as the Apoſtle ſayes.

               § 30. The laſt are theſe. One about the Ieſuits, that Adi

Another about three Bulls of Excommunication from the Pope, readie to be publiſhed in three eſpeciall parts of the Kingdome, if the powder-plot had taken effect. A third, about F. Garnet, and his beeing priuie to the ſaid treaſon, as by his often confeſſions both before and at his death may appeare yet, whereof ſome are vnder his hand. As for the firſt of theſe, the Adioynder may doe well to haue recourſe to Father Cotton, and to know of him what he thinkes, whether it be poſſible or no to attaine to ſuch a perfection, of not ſinning, in this life. Not onely as to auoid ſingula peccata, each ſinne in the particular, but euen omnia peccata, all altogether. The firſt of which Friar Soto ſaies is poſſible to all men (not onely to Ieſuits, or ſuch ſublimated creatures) and pro toto vitae curſu, as long as we here liue, not onely for certaine yeares, which is the caſe in the obiection. Neither is Soto onely of that opinion, among the Papiſts. Though the Biſhop doth not ſay, that any Ieſuite De Naturi & Grat. l. 1. Alſo Bellarm l. 2. de Grat. & lib. a

Whereas vain-glorie notwithſtanding, is one of the laſt ſinnes that we ſhake off, (as appeares by S. Paul, who was faine to be buffetted by an angel of Satan for the repreſſing of that vice in him) eſpecially in ſuch a life as Ignatius his was, daily meriting,

and riſing vp in merits. And yet as he, that beeing reuiled, and for a great while together ſaid nothing againe, at laſt when he cried out, See how patient I am, he loſt the praiſe which els he might haue wonne, if he had continued ſilent: So I would faine know, either of Ignatius, or his followers, how he that profeſſes his freedome from the ticklings of vaine-glorie, doth not thereby bewray, that he hath yet ſome ſpice of the old corruption in him, whereof he will not be aknowne.
               § 31. Concerning his ſecond Quaere: Strange, if Father Baldwine cannot reſolue him of that point, with all the circumſtances thereto belonging, inſomuch as one of them ſaw, or ſaide he ſaw, the very boxes or caskets, which contained thoſe Bulls, readie for the baiting. Neither is this ſo vnuſuall a practiſe in Poperie, that he ſhould beleeue it ſo ſlowly; either to minde ill to a whole State, eſpecially our Engliſh, which Eudaemon would haue vs thinke, that there is

Howbeit herein he miſtakes, whether wilfully, or no, let the reader iudge. For the Biſhop did not ſay, that the Ieſuit beeing in priſon, reuealed this concerning the Bulls, mooued meerely thereunto by remorſe of conſcience, though well he See the place in the Biſhops Anſwer to the Apologie, cap. 5. in initio. Id eſt, pag. 113. Which the Adioynder quoteth not (as his faſhion is in all other places) leaſt his wilfull forgerie and deprauation might be eſpied, making that to come of conſcience, Numb. 84. in two ſeuerall periods, which the Biſhop neuer ſo much as in the leaſt word inſinuateth, to haue proceeded therof. And yet it might be a truth, though reuealed in paſſion. might ſay, that he confeſſed it of his own accord, without feare, or compulſion, or examination any at all. Quid ſi in iurgio? what if in a pet? As the French prouerb is, that the boyling pot diſcouers the little pea that is in the very bottome of it. So enraged mindes diſcloſe all. But Mr. Adioynder thinks all is ſo holy among the Ieſuits, that if our compulſions and examinations be away, nothing is done by them forſooth, but of meere conſcience.
               
               § 32. The third and laſt, about Father Garnet, is otherwiſe ſufficiently teſtified to the world, though I ſay nothing:

both by the moſt reuerend Biſhop in ſundrie places of each his bookes, out of the authenticall Records of this Kingdome, and Father Garnets hand-writing yet to be ſeen. Againſt all which Father Thomas oppoſes the credit of a certaine nameleſſe Gentleman, that ſtood by Garnet (as himſelfe ſaies) whiles he was executed, and told him cleane otherwiſe, viz. that he neuer confeſſed any ſuch thing. Is it not reaſon that he ſhould be beleeued, though he brought no more then euen ſo to refell the Biſhop? And indeede no more he brings to conuince our Acts by, yea our eares and our eyes, our knowledge and our ſenſes that here liue, and were preſent at the whole paſſage. Yet he addes, that falſe bruits were ſpread againſt Garnet ouer all Chriſtendome. As much to ſay belike, as the whole Church was in an errour for cenſuring the Traytor. But to his notable impudence, brauing thus the Biſhop, that mirrour of grauitie, of conſcience, and ſinceritie, himſelfe a ſhadow, and one of Homers ſneakes,

as to vpbraid him with the lie, and the impudent lie, as the margent hath it, Numb. 82. or as the text riſeth afterward, Numb. 83. an egregious lie, I will ſay no more, but euen gently leading him by the hand, and bringing him home to his owne doore, remember him what libertie they in all likelihood take to themſelues of lying farre beyond vs, who thus dogmatize, That a lie in a Sermon is no mortall ſinne, I

                   ſuppoſe if it be to a good ende. And from hence it is that we haue ſo many lies in Poperie, prophecied of by S. Paul, 2. Tim. 4. 5. vt ſi vult decipi populus, decipiatur, that if the people will be deceiued, they may be deceiued, their owne common ſaying. Perhaps not thinking of that which they fit to their peoples backes, but euen too handſomely, by this meanes, Qui non ſuſceperunt amorem veritatis, ſed complacuerunt ſibi in iniquitate, 2. Theſſ. 2. 11. 12. who refuſed to entertaine the loue of truth, and delighted in falſhood and in iniuſtice, (voluerunt decipi, they would needes be deceiued;)

the very marke of the beaſt, and the character of them that are to liue vnder Antichriſt. But my wonder is not, that Papiſts lie, but that they lie in Sermons, and then excuſe it from crime, or from mortall blame: Firſt lying in their very doctrines, and in the courſe of their preaching, then raiſing a doctrine of the lawfulnes of lies.

               § 1. BEeing to ſpeake to your tenth and laſt Chapter, I think good to begin with ſetting downe the Title of it, as it lies in your booke, which is this: That the Biſhop ouerthroweth his owne cauſe, and fortifieth the Popiſh, graunting many important points of Catholike relligion. That he is turned Puritan in the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Supremacie, and betrayeth his Maieſties cauſe vnder

hand, pretending to defend it: and therefore is neither good Engliſh Proteſtant, nor yet good ſubiect. Laſtly, what is the opinion of learned ſtraungers, concerning him, and his booke; with a good aduiſe for a friendly farewell.
               
               §. 2. Doe you expect what I reply to this frantike inſcription? Spectatum admiſſi? Or rather, we will wiſh you ſome warme brothes to comfort your braine, then either confound it with blowes, as you euen now ſentenced (you may remember whom) pro ingenitâ modeſtiâ tuâ, or diſtreſſe Cap. 6. of the Adioynder.
                   it with gibings (though neuer ſo iuſt) already troubled. And yet before you come to execute your late glorious title and denunciation of this your tenth Chapter, you muſt doe as the Comoedians doe, that in their laſt act, bring in all the Actors vpon the ſtage afreſh, for pompe ſake: So you tell vs here, what feates you haue wrought, in the precedent part of your booke, as if they had neuer beene daſhed by any confutation, nor your enterlude diſturbed in the leaſt ſort. In the firſt Chapter I haue done this, (ſay you;) and in the ſecond Chapter this, in the third Chapter the like: and ſo you goe on, blazing your trophees, both in Text and Margent, as if no bodie could reply to you, none ſtand in your hands, but you had carried all afore you, whereſoeuer you came, like a yong Alexander. And yet more definitiuely, as it were from your iudgement-ſeat, thus you pronounce, an other Herod, that the world may take notice of your great equitie and vnpartialitie, ioyned with like gift of diſcerning ſpirits: Thou mayeſt remember (good Reader) that among many things, which I cenſured and reprooued in Ms. Barlow, I greatly allowed and approoued one, &c. No doubt, terrible is your cenſure, your reproofes dangerous, and woe be to them vpon whome they light. Yet the Prelate that you ſpeake of, were he aliue againe, he would reſt ſo little ſatisfied with your approbation of him, in that one point, whatſoeuer it is, among the many that you diſallowe in him, that he would coniure you into a boote, or into a bench-hole for your labour, like a ſawcy Sinckanter, and make you an example

for euer cenſuring him againe, or any of his ranke. But his vntimely death preuenting his paines, the want of the like ſpirits nouriſhes inſolencie, and fleſhes importunity, in ſuch bold companions as you and yours. As for that you tell the Reader, he may remember, &c. I aſſure you, it is more then I can doe, to remember that which I neuer read, neuer heard of. I gueſſe by the Margent you ſhould meane your Supplement, from which God excuſe me, for I would not read it if it were brought to me, or I hyred to peruſe it, ſpecially if it be like this that here you offer vs, the moſt woodden com-patchment, in ſuch tediouſneſſe of repetitions, that euer I hit on.
               § 3. Now there reſteth onely one point to be handled (ſay you) which is of farre different qualitie from the former. And that is, as you explane your ſelfe ſhortly after, of ſuch places in the Biſhops booke, as hee ouerthroweth his owne cauſe by, and fortifieth yours, euen more then euer Mr. Barlowe did. A prettie imagination: ſhall we ſee how trow? Firſt, becauſe he acknowledges, that Chriſt is to be adored, in & cum Sacramento,

Why not? ſith whereſoeuer he is, he is to be adored, and we denie him not to be in the Sacrament, (howſoeuer you ſlaunder vs) though wee define not the manner, but leaue that to him, who both can and will verifie his promiſe, though we be neither conſcious nor concurrent. I may ſay vnto you here, as Dionyſius to Sopater, Epiſt. 6. Non ſi quid non rubrum eſt, proptereà candidum; nec ſi quis non eſt equus, is homo ſit neceſſe eſt: Euerie thing is not white that is not redde, neither if we denie a thing to be a horſe, do we therefore ſtraight conclude that it is a man. The Biſhop grants that Chriſt is to be worſhipped, and that he is to be worſhipped in the Sacrament, which he infallibly accompanieth, and effectually aſſiſteth: Ergò, with you he is a Pontifician, and maintaineth your cauſe, and betrayeth his owne. No ſuch thing, gentle Sir. To make him yours, more goes to it then ſo. Eſpecially theſe two, Corporall preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation or conuerſion. Theſe are the two maine

                  badges, or rather buttreſſes, of your Cyclops, neither of which is be found in the Biſhops writing, and God knowes is farre off from his beleefe. Howbeit, thinke you not that Chriſt is ſo to be worſhipped in the Sacrament, or with the Sacrament, by our doctrine, as the Father with the Sonne, 
                     Athanaſ. ad Serap. Quòd Spiritus S. non ſit creatura. and the Sonne with the Father, or each of them in the other, where each partakes alike worſhip with the other: but as if I ſhould ſay, that the King is to be worſhipped, whether naked or in his cloathes; whether bare-headed, or with his crowne & diademe on; ſo Chriſt is to be worſhipped in the Sacrament, and with the Sacrament, euery where no doubt, but more ſpecially there, where ſo incomparable a benefit exhibited to our eyes, and preſented to our hands, iuſtly challengeth Cyrill.

               § 4. Though againe, when we ſay that Chriſt is in the Sacrament (becauſe we would not be miſtaken) we ſay not that he is there after a corporall manner: nay, that your own Captaine and Cardinall diſclaimeth, Corporaliter 
                  
                     Bellarm. de Sacr. Euchariſt. l. 1. c. 2. where he addes out of S. Bernard, Serm de S. Martino; that, In Sacramento exhibetur nobis vera carnis (Chriſti) ſubſtantia, ſed ſpiritualiter non carnaliter: that is, that the true fleſh of Chriſt is communicated to vs in the Sacrament, yet not carnally, but ſpiritually. What other doe we teach at this day? Therefore Bellarm, in the wordes following, puts his finger to his mouth, and giues vs an item, not to talke too much of this point. Non videtur haec vex multùm frequentanda. And, Periculum eſt ne trahatur ab aduerſarijs, &c.
                   
                  eſſe Chriſtum in Sacramento: but we ſay not ſo much as that his fleſh is there, or his The Rhemiſts are ſo confounded in their bodily preſen
                           •
                        e, that they make Chriſts bodie to be a figure of it ſelfe, in the Sacrament. Rhem. vpon Luk. 12. adding, that Chriſt is the image of his father, and yet of the ſame ſubſtance with him. But who knowes not, that the Father and the Sonne are two diſtinct perſons, or ſuppoſita, ſo as well may one be image of the other? But Chriſts bodie is onely one, and the ſame. I would they had brought no other images into the church, but ſuch as are the ſame with the primitiue or prototypon. bodie there at all, not onely after a bodily or fleſhly manner. Chriſtus (ſaith S. Leo) quadrageſimo poſt reſurrectionem die, coram diſcipulis eleuatus in coelum, corporalis praeſentiae modum fecit, &c. Chriſt made a period of his bodily preſence, beeing lifted vp into heauen, before the face of his Diſciples the fortieth day after his reſurrection. And S. Auſten out of thoſe words, Matth. 26. Non ſemper habebitis me vobiſcum, with other like in S. Iohn, chap. 12. reſolues it plainely, that ſecundum carnem non ſemper, according to the fleſh, he is not alwayes

with vs. Tract. 109. in Ioh. It were not hard to produce diuers more to the ſame purpoſe. Yea, Si eſſet in terra, non eſſet ſacerdos, Heb. 8. If Chriſt were on the earth, he could be no Prieſt. So as you deſtroy his Prieſthood, while you ſtand for ſuch preſence, to commend your Sacrifice. I ſay therefore neither bodily, nor in bodie at all. For though the fleſh and the deitie of our Sauiour Chriſt neuer were ſeparated, nor neuer may be, ſince the firſt inſtant of his ſacred conception, if you attend the knot of perſonall vnion, yet the Godhead is ſpread through diuerſe places and ſpaces, S. Hierome in Mark. c. 12. ſaies of Chriſt, Coniungens in coenā purâ agnum cum pane: finiens vetus, novum inch
                           •
                        ans teſtamentum. So as the bread remaines. For as the paſſeouer in the lambe, ſo the Euchariſt in bread: or elſe the new Teſtament is not yet begun. And the ſame Hierome ſoone after in Mark. 14. Transfigurans corpus ſuum in panem, formās ſanguinem ſuum in calicem: that Chriſt be tranſubſtantiated into the elements, not the elements into Chriſt, by S. Hieromes manner of ſpeaking. But by this, we ſee, the Fathers were farre from beeing ſo ſtrict for Trāſubſtantiation of the bread (as the Papiſts are now adaies) onely labouring to fulfill the veritie of the Sacrament, and to bring Chriſt, and his ordinance, together. which the bodie and fleſh approacheth not in any diſtance. Vnles you wil be ſo wood now, as to adde brutiſh 
                     Ʋ
                     biquitiſme, to your barbarous Cyclopiſme. So as Chriſt may be in the Sacrament, and there adored, yet his bodie be neither there, or not after bodily manner at leaſt; but howſoeuer it be there, not transformed, nor tranſubſtantiated out of the bread, as your conceit is. And thus therefore there is not paries, or maceries onely, but murus ſtill, or valtum, betweene yours and the reuerend Biſhops aſſertion. The profoundneſſe of this myſterie, leads vs to wade thus ſoftly and ſuſpenſiuely, knowing that Gods wayes are in many waters, and his footſteps vnknowne, his pathes vnſearchable. Wee can ſcarce diſcerne the print of his chariot-wheeles, as he rides along before our eyes, onely wee heare a noyſe in the tops of the mulberrie trees, as Dauid did ſometime, 2. Sam. 5. 24. The bones of the Paſſeouer muſt be burnt with fire, ſaith S. Chryſoſtome, and S. Theophylact, that is, Diuine myſteries

§ 5. I had thought I had beene at an ende of this intricate queſtion, or neere an ende, when I was croſſed in my conceits by the author of the Manna. Whoſe intents as I cannot but praiſe for auouching the honour, and expreſſing the fruit of this diuine myſterie, ſo, what weight there is in his remonſtrances for their Tranſubſtantiation, that one ſentence of his may ſhew, which he quotes out of S. Cyrill of Hieruſalem, Catecheſi 4. Myſtagogica, and he is content to ſeeme to put ſuch affiance in, as in that ſhippe to venture all his ware, which the wiſe forbid. For which cauſe alſo, he hath not onely ſingled it out from the reſt, but ſet it in the front of his following Diſcourſe, while he inſerts it into his Epiſtle to his moſt Excellent MAIESTIE, as the motiue moſt of might, in all his Mount of Teſtimonies (ſo he calls them;) belike mons caſeatus according well with coelum mellifluum, or nubes eſcatilis, as Tertullian deſcribes it. Well, what ſaies S. Cyrill? I will tranſlate it out of the Latine, as the Author renders it, though the Latine be not ſo exact with the Greeke in all points. Knowing this, and beleeuing it for certaine, that this bread which we ſee is not bread, although the taſt diſcernes it to be bread, but that it is the bodie of Chriſt. And the wine which we ſee, although it ſeeme to be wine to our ſenſe of taſt, yet is not wine, but the blood of Chriſt. This S. Cyrill. In all which wordes, of Tranſubſtantiation not a word; or conuerſion any. And yet this ſentence muſt carrie the world, by the iudgement of our Author, ſpeaking from the clowdes, and diſtilling influences. But he that does not acknowledge the phraſe of the holy Fathers, ſpeaking of Chriſts Sacraments, to magnifie the vertue of the hidden grace, with a certaine contempt of the externall ſigne, or aboliſhment rather, that the other may be moſt eminent, he may ſooner bewray his rawnes in Diuinitie, then hurt the cauſe by his profound arguing. Zelus domus tuae comedit me, ſaies the Prophet Dauid: And, Zelus menſae tuae nos, may they ſay. I meane the ſupernall and myſticall table, (which themſelues

For what prophane eye cannot diſcerne of them ſo? Who ſo ill nurtured, or ſo new-illuminate, ſuch as thoſe were to whome S. Cyrill ſpeakes here? But to lift vp the minde higher, to bring the ſpouſe into the wine-cellar, (as the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes in the Canticles) and to acquaint them with the treaſure which thoſe homely veſſells containe, that was here S. Cyrills ſtudie, and about that the holy Fathers ſpend their ſtrengths moſt willingly, when they treat of this argument. The Cardinall ſaies, (I graunt) that in a Catechiſme, all things ſhould be laid out moſt literally, and moſt plainly. And therefore S. Cyrill calling his workes here Catechizings, wee ſhould 
                  For whereas he addes farther in the ſame place, that Cyrill was neuer ſuſpected of error about the Sacrament, though he ſpeake ſo; it is a meere bauble. As if we diſſented from Cyrill, and not from them about the meaning of his words. 
                  looke for no figures, but all direct. In Catecheſi omnia propriè & ſimpliciter explic antur, ſaies he. Lib. 2. de Euchariſt. cap. 13. Forgetting that theſe, though they are called Catechizings, yet not ſo much of inſtruction, as ours are wont to be, when we teach in Churches, as of ſpurre and exhortation to the new-illuminate, (they are called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   here by S. Cyrill,) to inflame their minds, to kindle their affections, rather then to inlighten their iudgements, (Seraph-like, not Cherub-like, if I may be ſuffered ſo to ſpeake,) that they would conſider of their profeſſion, and adorne their calling, keepe pure their garments, and henceforth conſtrue of occurrents in relligion, rather Chriſtianly then popularly, which is the cauſe that S. Cyrill lifts vp his voice, and beſpeakes them in the language of vehemence new laid downe. Not onely to preſerue the primitiue phraſe of the inſtitution, though that preuaile we ſee ſo farre with the Apoſtle Paul, as to

call it the bodie, when he calls it the bread (euen with one 1. Cor. 10. cap. item

As another of them, beeing to expreſſe the benefit of Baptiſme (a Sacrament leſſe admired, though of moſt principall operation) is not afraide to ſay as much for our tranſubſtantiation into Chriſt, as they can alleadge for the breads, out of any writer. And yet I hope they will not ſay, that we are really metamorphoſed, or ſubſtantially transformed, into Chriſts bodie, by Baptiſme. Leo Ser. 14. de Paſſ. Dom. In Baptiſme (ſaith he) while we lay downe the old man, and take vp the new, there is a ſemblant of our dying, as well as of our riſing againe; both in one.

That is, [The bodie of the partie Chriſtened, is the fleſh of our Lord, crucified.] This S. Leo. And to helpe you to Tranſubſtantiation, he enclines almoſt to vtter abolition, or annihilation, if that may gratifie you. For he ſaies, Non idem poſt qui ante lavacrum. That is, [The baptized partie is not the ſame after, that he was before his baptiſme.] What more daungerous word could S. Cyrill let fall, or any Father of them all, to ſound for your ſuppoſalls about Tranſubſtantiation, while they meant no ſuch thing (your ſelues will confeſſe that they neuer meant it in baptiſme) but onely ſought to endeare the Sacrament to vs, and to auerre the ſoueraigne vertue of it? But let S. Cyrill be iudge, as we read him in the ſame place, which our Catecheſ. 4. generali, quae prima in Graeca editione Morel. Anni 1564.

               § 6. Firſt, in his firſt Catecheſe, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , out of which the aforeſaid authoritie is quoted. He makes

and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  , nor ſimply 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to be oppoſed to the body and blood of Chriſt. Which ſhews, that he enclines not to Tranſubſtantiation, but a change of the vſe, and an encreaſe of the grace, or benediction, that goes with them. For 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is not repugnant to 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  , or 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and may be wine ſtill. Againe, he imputes this to the 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   ouer them, the invocation of Gods grace, and holy Spirits aſſiſtance, (which likewiſe he repeats in his ſift Catecheſ: ſoone after) not to demurmuratorie words, which they vſe in Poperie, and call Conſecration. Yea doubtles, comparing this our Chriſtian ſeruice, with the ſeruice of deuills, (to giue a little light by way of contrarietie) wherein things offered to deuills, are made prophane by ſuch offering, (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) though afore they were ſacred, or indifferent, he giues vs to vnderſtand, that he meanes no more, but that the elements by prayer acquire a degree of ſanctification (not of nature,) (I meane relatiue and collatiue, not eſſentiall ſanctification) Creatura ſanctificatur per orationem & verbum dei. 1. Tim. 4. 5. though they are called by him the bodie and blood of Chriſt, in the ſame place, as they are alſo by S. Paul in the chapters before noted, either to keepe the phraſe of Chriſts primitiue inſtitution (as I ſaide) or to augment their reuerence, and to proclaime their worth, for effectuall operation.
               § 7. Another place is in the Catecheſe which the obiection is taken out of, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . You ſhall heare what words lie round about it, to direct vs in the vnderſtanding. Firſt, he ſaies we haue the bodie of Chriſt reached to vs, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in the type of bread, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , his blood in the type of wine, not in the Accidents of either. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   beeing put ſo conſtantly for a ſubſtantiall ſimile, as I thinke they will not eaſily ſhew example to the contrarie. And therefore no Tranſubſtantiation with S. Cyrill. But he promiſes vs to be concorporate, and of one blood with Chriſt, adding that wee ſhall be made partakers of the diuine nature by the ſame meanes, as S. Peter had ſaid.] Which ſure is not their

lot that receiue at all-aduentures, as it ſhould be, if Chriſts fleſh were really in the Sacrament, but according to the faith of each godly receiuer, ſo it happens vnto him to be vnited to Chriſt, and that is the transformation which S. Cyrill here driues at. In ſo much as he condemnes Sarcophagie in plain tearms, which is the opiniō that ſome haue, as if they ſhould eate Chriſts naturall fleſh in the Sacrament, (the very Popiſh Canniball at this day.) And he counts them Capernaites, for their groſſe conceit of that Diuine myſterie, ſaying that no meruaile if they went back from Chriſt, Ioh. 6. v. 66. (euen as this driues many backe now, in Poperie) onely for want of ſpirituall vnderſtanding. Yet what ſpirituall vnderſtanding I pray, if Chriſts fleſh be eaten properly, properly betweene our teeth, digeſted properly into the members of our bodie, as he had ſaid before, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , except onely that he ſaies not properly, becauſe he meanes myſtically, and no otherwiſe.
               § 8. Then comes in the diſtinction, betweene 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , or 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and themſelues as they are ſanctified. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Conſider not the bread and wine, as ſingle bread and wine. For why? they are ſanctified. And in our Sauiours phraſe they are his bodie and his blood, but in our Sauiours phraſe onely, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , ſaies S. Cyrill. What more true? And now we are not to thinke, that no more vertue goes with them, then the eye can perceiue, or the taſt diſcerne, but wee muſt reſt our ſelues vpon our Sauiours words, vpon faith, not vpon ſenſe. This is all the appeale from ſenſe to faith, that S. Cyrill allows, not for quelling the natures, but extolling the powers, of the conſecrated elements. As he ſaies in the concluſion of his fourth Catecheſe, as it were taunting at the ſenſes, if they conteſt with faith, or intrude themſelues vnmannerly into Gods myſteries, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , though ſenſe be frampoll, though ſenſe will needes haue it ſo, (Hagar againſt Sarah) that is raw ſenſe, and vncontrolled by the Spirit, which els is

ſo gouerned & trained from aboue, as (not renouncing the taſt, or digging out the eyes, with the heatheniſh Democritus, but onely waſhing and cleanſing them in the poole Siloam,) in a rugged ſhell it ſees a pearle moſt pretious.
               § 9. The like in his fift Catecheſe, and vpon the like grounds. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. That is, Commit not the iudgement of this matter to your throate (your bodily throate) but to ſtedfaſt faith, &c. And good reaſon. For which he addes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is, For no bodie is willed to eate bread, or to taſt wine, (when the Sacrament is to be receiued:) But as the ſemblants or memorialls of Chriſts body and blood, ſo are they reached to vs, and ſo receiued of vs. Moſt truely, and moſt diuinely. Which hinders not their perſiſting in the ſame nature that they were, though they are deliuered to vs, as inſtruments now of another worke, or as monuments, or pledges, of a greater grace. Nay, becauſe he makes them 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , figures onely of his blood, and figures of his bodie, he denies the eſſentiall in the Papiſts rawe ſenſe at leaſt, to all that are not preiudicate.
               § 10. But becauſe I am ſtept into his fift Catecheſe ere I was aware, I will conclude with that. One time we read thus there. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . He had ſaid that we inuoke or call for the holy Ghoſt, to be ſent downe vpon the elements as they lie before vs: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Then he addes, as the Greek imports, newly ſet downe; For whereſoeuer the holy Spirit of God doth but touch, immediately the thing is ſanctified, and alſo changed. Loe what tranſmutation S. Cyrill meanes, namely, Yet the Author of the Manna, quotes Mr. Caſaubone, as if he were aſtounded with the word. Tranſmutation, ſo often occurring in the Greek Fathers. No cauſe why. that which ſtands onely in ſanctification. And he ſaies, wherſoeuer the holy Ghoſt but toucheth, the like tranſmutation is inſtantly wrought. Yet how often doe we change by the operation of the holy Ghoſt, and not in ſubſtance? As, à gloria in gloriam, tanquam à Domini ſpiritu: which words were the concluſion of his laſt Catecheſe before this; and many the

like changes that might be brought for inſtance. Finally, thus: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . And againe bringing them together, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . That is, Holy is that before vs, Holy you whome the holy Ghoſt hath inſpired. Holy things with holy things beare good proportion. Yet what 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   betweene Chriſt and vs, in the matter of holineſſe? what proportion or correſpondence betweene our holineſſe and his? As S. Chryſoſtome ſweetly ſaies vpon Matth. 5. p. 96. edit. Etonen. Betweene Gods mercie, and humane pitty, there is as much difference, as betweene the very goodnes and naughtineſſe that is incident to men. And ſo alſo betweene our holineſſe and Chriſts holineſſe. Therefore S. Cyrill concludes, looking vp to Chriſt; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . There is but one holy, there is but one Lord, which is Ieſus Chriſt. Riſing from the elements, paſſing by themſelues which were of the audience, pitching in Chriſt. Whom he knewe to be farre aboue, and in an other region, not in altars made with hands, but in the Kingdome euerlaſting, where righteouſneſſe dwels, that is, where himſelfe. So as we haue the Phariſee as well as the Capernaite, Popiſh Iuſtification together with Tranſubſtantiation, here cōfuted. But this purpoſely, that by the way.
               § 11. As for Bellarmines addition to the other teſtimonies of S. Cyrill (which the Manna pretermits, or at leaſt makes no vaunt of it in his Dedicatorie) that S. Cyrill ſhould forbid vs in his fift Catecheſe, to ſpill the crummes of the holy Euchariſt, Ergò, he preſuppoſeth bodily preſence; I anſwer in one word: we doe the like with them, (I meane with the crummes, which our Lord forbad to be ſpilt, when they miniſtred no grace, but onely manifeſted his power, Ioh. 6. 12.) And not onely with them, but with things much leſſe holy. We beare a meete reſpect towards them, Propter connexionem cum Sancto; as the nature of mankind is, (euen without a Schoole-maſter) to be mooued with the bye, and where we honour the principall, not to contemne the appertinances. Yet no Transformators, no ſuch ſauage Sarcophagi, as S. Cyrill bends his penne againſt, in the place

before ſhewed. And thus much of S. Cyrill. I returne into my way, and from Manna to Marah, to the Adioynders cauills.
               § 12. Two more he vſes yet about this matter of the Sacrament, which I will ende with them, them with it. One, that Caluine and diuerſe other Proteſtant Diuines, denie that Chriſt is to bee worſhipped in the Sacrament, or with the Sacrament, that ſo he may make the Biſhop to be irregular and paradoxicall, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Though it bee allowed to Eagles to flie alone, and they are ſaid to be but ſheepe that alwaies heard together, yet he ſhall neuer put this ſcandall vpon the Reuerend Biſhop, nor diuide in him the eminence of a Paſtor moſt conſpicuous, from the meekeneſſe and the conformableneſſe of the quieteſt lambe in the flocke. Therfore ſhore vp your eyes, good Mr 
                  Adioynder, and looke once again vpon your Bellarmine, from whom you ſtole theſe quotations, wherewith your Margent is be-painted, in this place, of Calvine, and Melancthon, denying, as you pretend, the worſhip of the Sacrament, in the ſenſe aforeſaid: though ſtill I muſt tell you, that the Biſhop neuer auouched the worſhip of the Sacrament, (which ſome of your owne Diuines denie, if Lib. 4. de Sacram. Euchariſt. c. 29. § De modo autem, &c. Nempe [ipſi Catho

                  Bellarmine ſay true) but onely of the Lord, either accōpanying his Sacrament, or whereſoeuer elſe preſent. You ſhall finde in Bellarmine, that all the queſtiō between our Diuines about the worſhipping of the Sacrament, is twofold: The one during the vſe and the act of the Lords Supper, the other for the time following, and vpon the reſeruation of the elements. And though this may finde but ſmall friendſhip among our writers, which, if your opinion be not diſclaimed, expoſes Chriſt to the moſt abhominable iniuries that may be, (as namely, to be worried or waſted of beaſts, while you pretend to keepe him to be worſhipped of men,) yet in the act of participation, Contendunt Chriſti corpus eſſe adorandum, (ſaith he) they are earneſt to auouch the worſhipping

You ſhall heare Calvine therefore, whom your ſelfe quote, as a condemner of this worſhip, how modeſtly and how mildly hee diſcuſſes the whole queſtion hereabout. Institut. l. 4. c. 17. Parag. 35. Quomodò ex re ambiguâ ceriò conficient quod volunt? Nempe vbi certo Dei verbo deſiciſe videbunt, quo vno conſiſtunt animae noſtrae, vbi Apoſtolorum doctrinam & exempla ſibi aduerſari, ſe verò ſolos ſibi authores eſſe cogitabunt, &c. Accedent etiam alia. Quid? an res erat nullius momenti Deum hac forma adorare, vt nihil nobis praeſcriberetur? An cum de vero Dei cultu ageretur, tantâ leuitate fuerat tentandum, de quo nullum vſquam verbum legebatur? That is; How will they conclude certenly, out of a thing vncertaine? For when they ſhall ſee they are deſtitute of Gods moſt pregnant word, vpon which alone our ſoules rely, when they ſhall ſee that both the doctrine, and examples of the Apoſtles are wanting to them, and that themſelues are the onely authors of this deuiſe, namely then they will be to ſeeke for their adoration. So that Calvine, you ſee, argues from the want of ground in Scriptures for this controuerted worſhip, rather then oppugnes it in any odious or offenſiue faſhion. As alſo that ſhewes which followes in him. [Is it a ſmall matter, ſaith he, to adore God in ſuch a manner as he neuer preſcribed, or ſhould that be ſo lightly or raſhly attempted in the matter of Gods worſhip, of which we neuer read any word any where extant?] At ſi quâ decet humilitate, &c. auſcultaſſent certè quod ipſe dixit, Accipite, manducate, bibite, huic

Et quando hic in terris Principes aliquò proficiſcuntur, non eunt ad eum finem, vt ab occurrentibus ſalutentur, & tamèn, &c. Quare aduerſarij pluris faciunt printipem terrenum, quàm Chriſtum. Vide Greg. de Valent. Tom. 3. Comm. Theol. Diſput. 6. quaeſt. 11. de Idololatria. punct. 4. I know, that both Bellarm. and 
                     Ʋalentia, and the reſt of you, are wont to ſcoffe at this argument. [He bids vs receiue it, but not adore it.] This (ſay you) follows not. But you ſhall ſee that Epiphanius argues ſo altogether in his Tractate againſt the Collyridian heretikes, of which before. Marie was holy, ſaies he, Marie was created for good vſe, and for the benefit of mankind, but not to be worſhipped. This is his manner of arguing. If you deride vs, deride him too, for our methode is the ſame. I returne to Calvine. Habemus Apoſtolorum exemplum, quos non legimus proſtratos adorâſſe, ſed vt erant diſcumbentes accepiſſe & manducâſſe. Habemus Apoſtolicae Eccleſiae vſum, vbi fideles non in adoratione, &c. That is; We haue the practiſe of the Apoſtles for vs, of whome we doe not read, that they fell proſtrate and adored, but as they ſate at table they tooke and eate. We haue the obſeruation of the Church, in the Apoſtles time, of whome S. Luke reports, that the faithfull communicated, not in worſhipping, but breaking of the bread. We haue laſtly the doctrine of the Apoſtles on our ſide, namely that in which Paul inſtructed the Corinthians [not mentioning the adoration of the Sacrament in leaſt wiſe, and yet] profeſſing that what he deliuered to them he receiued of the Lord. In fine he concludes: Atque haec quidem eò tendunt, 
                  Expendant Loctores. 
                  vt expendant pij lectores, quàm non tutum ſit in rebus tam arduis, &c. Calvine would haue vs to refraine from worſhipping the Sacrament of the Euchariſt for ſafetie ſake. Quia non tutum. Nam vt Chriſtum illic ritè apprehendant piae animae, in coelum erigantur neceſſe eſt. For the ſoule that will apprehend Chriſt rightly in the Sacrament, muſt be lifted vp into heauen, there is no remedie. Can you denie this to be moſt true? He addes yet. Quid ergo? ſuperſtitioſum eſſe cultum negabimus, cum ſeſe homines coram pane proſternunt, vt Chriſtum illic adorent? Huic malo proculdubio obuiare voluit Nicaena Synodus

&c. That is; What then? ſhall we denie that to be a ſuperſtitious kind of worſhip, when men caſt downe themſelues before a piece of bread, to the end they may worſhip Chriſt there? No doubt the Nicene Councell intended to preuent this miſchiefe, when it forbad vs to be too baſely or ſollicitouſly attentiue about the elements ſet before vs. And for this cauſe the people were wont to be aduertiſed by ſome one ſpeaking in a loud voice, ſurſum corda, that they ſhould lift vp their hearts. The Scripture alſo ſhewing vs where to ſeeke Chriſt, bids vs ſeeke him in heauen, at the right hand of his Father, Col. 3. 1. Secundum hanc regulam erat potiùs ſpiritualiter in coeleſti gloria adorandus Chriſtus, quàm excogitandum iſtud tam periculoſum adorationis genus, &c. According to this rule we ought rather to worſhip Chriſt ſpiritually, and as he is placed in the heauenly glorie, then deuiſe this ſo daungerous kind of adoration. Daungerous he calls it, becauſe it may haue euill conſequence, and be of kindred to groſſe and carnall opinions, concerning God, as are his words following in the ſame place; alſo he preferres the other before it by a potiùs, or by a rather onely, as ſparing the reſt. Laſtly, he thus diſputes, or concludes ſhall I ſay, in his 37. Parag. not farre from the former place. Chriſto inquiunt hanc venerationem deferimus. Primùm ſi in caena hoc fieret, dicerem adorationem eam demum eſſe legitimam, qua non in ſigno reſidet, ſed ad Chriſtum in coelo ſedentem dirigitur. The queſtion is there about the carrying of the hoſt vp and downe in pompe. And they alleadge for themſelues, ſaith he, that they giue this worſhip to Chriſt. But how does Calvine anſwer them? I am firſt to ſay, quoth he, that if this were done of them, at the time of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, neuertheleſſe that worſhip onely were to be counted lawfull, which did not reſt in the element, but roſe vp higher, and were directed to Chriſt ſitting in heauen. Where you ſee he reſiſts the circumgeſtation of the hoſt, rather then the reuerence that belongs to the Lords Supper, and graunts directly, that in cana ſi hoc fieret, in the

Lords Supper if this were done (namely that Chriſt were adored there) he would not greatly miſlike it, ſo we ſoared aboue the ſigne, and confined him not to the element, but roſe vp in our cogitations to him, as he is ſitting in heauen. The Biſhop therefore reuolts not from the current of our Diuines, about the worſhipping of the Sacrament, but worſhipping Chriſt whereſoeuer he findes him (for euen Bellarmine can tell vs here, that we are not tied to any Bell. vbi priùs, ex Ioh. 4. Non in hoc monte, &c. place, Ioh. 4. ſince the times of the new Teſtament, but that they admit of all alike,) yet willinglieſt riſes aboue the ſphere of the Creation, & conſiders him as apparelled with celeſtiall glorie. This was one.
               § 13. Another thing that I am to note, of kin to the former, and entangled with the argument of the adoration of the Sacrament, is this. In ſumme, a groſſe vntruth of the Adioynders, Numb. 4. In that quoting the Biſhops booke, pag. 201. lin. 8. he ſaies he treats of the ſame matter there, viz. of the worſhipping of Chriſt in the Sacrament. Of which not a word, on my word, in that place, but by occaſion of another queſtion about worſhipping Gods footeſtoole, which S. Auguſtine and S. Ambroſe conſtrue to be the fleſh of our Sauiour Chriſt, not any materiall footeſtoole, as the Papiſts would haue it, he ſhews how the fleſh and humane nature of Chriſt may be worſhipped, by the priuiledge of their aſſumption into his Godhead. And he explicates it by the ſimilitude of a King, and his roabe, which participates in a manner of the reuerence done to the King himſelfe. This doe both S. Auguſtine and the Biſhop manifeſtly in that place; I ſay, they ſhew how Chriſts fleſh may be worſhipped with the Godhead, whereas the Adioynder ſaies the Biſhop teaches by this compariſon, that the fleſh of Chriſt may be adored with the Sacrament, and the Sacrament with it, by vertue of ſuch coniunction. Which is a notable vntruth, as I ſaid before, the Biſhop neither inſinuating any thing to that purpoſe in all that place, and vtterly denying it elſwhere, viz. pag. 195. of the ſame

booke. The Sacrament no where, ſaies he, the earthly part, lib. 4. c. 34. as Irenaeus calls it, but Chriſt euery where is to be worſhipped. And his fleſh too: but as he declares afterward out of S. Auſten, p. 201. lin. 8. as euen now I noted. Such conſcience in his reporting, or ſuch diligence in his reading, heed in his obſeruing, vſeth the Adioynder. But ſo much of the firſt branch of this chapters accuſation, concerning the Sacrament. I am to be ſhort in the reſt.
               § 14. ANother is, about the Reward of good works. He ſaies, Numb. 6. the Biſhop fauours their opinion in that too. As if we, when we denie either iuſtification by workes, or the merit of good workes after iuſtification, denyed reward, recompence, retribution. We acknowledge with S. Gregorie in

But yet againe, we cannot but ioyne with S. Hilarie, ſaying, That for ſo much

Quibus (ſaies he) nec laborantibus nec nentibus, extra operis mercedem gloriae candor a Deo indultus eſt, &c. And thus, he ſuppoſeth wee are made like the Angels, which condition you knowe we are promiſed, totidem verbis, elſewhere, namely, Luk. 20. 36. And yet the Angels merits are little ſpoken of in Scripture, mans rather (though no were avouched, yet the rather I ſay, of the two) that man may be ſtirred vp, to the working of good workes, with no leſſe zeale, and feruencie, then if the obtaining of the crowne depended meerly therupon. But the Angels hazard and probation-time beeing paſt, nothing is pronounced but

to whom the glorie of meriting muſt neuertheleſſe belong in all reaſon, before we men may challenge it. Yea, but meritum and merces (ſaith the Adioynder) are correlatiues, and if reward be graunted, merit may by no meanes be denyed. It followes not, good Sir.

               § 15. The Hebrew word for wages, (the Adioynders Merces, that he argues from) ſignifies (as I haue heard) but as much as the calx, the heele in a mans body. Becauſe as the heele is the finall, the bottome of Gods workemanſhip, ſo the worke ceaſeth when the wages is paid. As Salomon can tell vs, that he that payeth afore-hand, cuts off the hands, and the legges, meaning that the wages is the period of the worke, and that beeing paid, all paines are at an ende; no bodie workes when he hath receiued his pay, no more then if his armes, or his legges were cut off. And the Latine calx, the goale after a race, may perchance come from thence, (but I define nothing) as the finall of that exerciſe, in which they reſt and breath themſelues, that ranne before. Conſummaui curſum, 2. Tim. 4. 7. The Greeke word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   therefore muſt be no otherwiſe conſtrued in the New Teſtament; for the New loues to ſpeake in the tearmes of the Old, as they know that know any thing. And ſo Merces is not ſo proud as to inferre merit, (as the Adioynder would) but onely the reward which the worke precedeth, and the worke is concluded by that reward. They haue receiued their reward, their

                   word merit (as the Adioynder notes) wiſhing rather it had neuer been in vſe: which is no more then S. Auſten of the word Fortune, and yet that the Scripture vſeth in diuers places, Retract. as in S. Luke, and Eccleſiaſtes, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , 1. Cor. 12. 10. Much more therefore that which the Scripture neuer vſeth, as the word merit, though they tranſlate

                   ſo, Heb, 13. moſt vnfittly; vnleſſe you will abate from the ſenſe of merit, (as Bellarmine euen now) rather then racke 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   to ſo abominable inſolence. S. Hierome in his Comm. in Matth. 10. ſayes that Iſſachar by interpretation ſignifies merces, that is to ſay wages, a brand for them that hold by merit, as it is correlatiue to wages, as the Adioynder teacheth; there beeing 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the wages of wickedneſſe, or of vnrighteouſneſſe (no leſſe then of good workes) which who will ſay we properly merit, vnleſſe it be the wages of woe and condemnation for ſiune? 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , is ſtill put in Scripture in the bad ſenſe, as might be ſhewed more at large if it were pertinent. Ioh. 10. twice together, Luk. 15. likewiſe twice, &c. So as well might S. Chryſoſtome ſay, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that wee in Rom. muſt not ſerue God for pay, but for his owne ſake. Though it is true, that Ipſe eſt merces noſtra magna nimis, Geneſ. 15. And does the Adioynder thinke that he can merit God? Of merit hitherto.
               § 16. As for the iuſtice, that is incident to the keeping of promiſe, that there may be a iuſtice in our rewards whatſoeuer; ſuch a iuſtice we graunt you, we contend not about it. God; way of rewarding vs (when he accepts our pains, reſts wel pleaſed with our endeauours) is full of this iuſtice. Yea, all the wayes of God are iuſt and true, ſo: God is queſtionleſſe iuſt in all his courſes. In the creation of the world, in the giuing of the firſt grace, in the ſending of his Sonne to bee our Redeemer; but ſo as merit creepe in neuer the more for

all that, and much leſſe the Biſhop turne praeuaricator, the cleereſt confeſſor, and the directeſt champion, (let the triall bee his carriage euen in this verie controuerſie) that euer yet encountred you in the cauſe. Shall I ſay, that as Annibal 
                  Frontinus ſtratag. would perſwade the Romans that Fabius was for Carthage, and therefore burnt not his gardens, when he burnt all the reſt, threaping kindneſſe vpon him? Or rather as I haue heard ſome Sophiſters in the Schooles, when they were puzled with an argument, which they could not tell how to anſwer, they would fall to trifling and ſhifting, Haec omnia veriſſima ſunt, concedo tibi cuncta, iam meas partes agis, &c. but were neuer a whit the neerer to the aſſoyling of the obiection, in wiſe mens iudgements: ſo the Adioynder doth here, and in this whole Chapter. He ſaies the Biſhop is turned Popiſh, and cloſes with the Cardinall, becauſe he confutes the Cardinall, (as it were getting within him) either by his owne authorities, or at leaſt by his owne Authors, as Gregorie de Ʋalent. here for one. And Secluſâ promiſſione diuinâ non ſuppetit aliquis ſufficiens titulus propter quem Deus debeat compenſare tale opus vitâ aeterná. Valent. 8. 6. 4.

I would to God that all were anſwerable, and in all points, exceptis ijs quae aut optare aut ſperare dementis eſt, yet hearken you in a word how much farther both the Cardinall and certaine others haue gone in challenging to themſelues the heauenly fauour (which is better then the life, then the Kingdome it ſelfe, if we beleeue Dauid:

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , for his diuine pietie ſake, then diuerſe vnder him, not onely with your elenches, but with your more forcible engines, I meane your rackes and your ſtrappadoes, would euer be brought to do. And firſt the Cardinal, the card that you ſaile by, de iuſtif. l. 2. c. 16. Effectus infuſae charitatis eſt, reconciliare hominem Deo, & hic effectus conſequitur ex naturâ rei abſolutè. That is: The effect of the loue of

God, dwelling in our ſoules, is ſuch, as to make our peace betweene God and vs. And this effect followes abſolutely ex naturâ rei, out of the nature of that qualitie, viz. the loue of God, as it is ſhedde abroad in our hearts. The queſtion is, betweene the Adioynder and vs, whether the fauour of God follow vpon our good works, or vertuous habits, ſeclusâ promiſſione, without the promiſe of God, yea or no? Or rather in truth, this is not the queſtion. But the Biſhop not onely graunting this, but mainely vrging it, and thereby either extenuating, or cleane ouerthrowing their ſuppoſed merit, the Adioynder ſaies, that herein the Biſhop ſaies no more then the ranckeſt Papiſt of them all: viz. that all merit preſuppoſes Gods promiſe. 
                  The Adioynders words, cap. 10. num. 8. & 9. We are ſo far from reiecting the conſideration of Gods promiſe, that wee ground the merit of euerlaſting life ſpecially thereupon. And yet here wee haue the Cardinall aſcribing our friendſhip with Almightie God, our peace and our reconciliation with the Lord of all things, (which is our moſt immediate title to the kingdome of heauen, and the remoouing of the maineſt barre that keepes vs out from thence, or can poſſibly keep vs,) to the effect of ſuch poore charitie as is found inherent in vs, ex naturâ rei abſolutè: the promiſe, either ſuppreſt, or at leaſt ſilenced; yea ſo ſilenced, as ſuppreſt for certaine, renounced plainely. But Vaſquez more audaciouſly and preſumptuouſly yet, then Bellarmine, (the beaſt belike waxing prowder and prowder) in I á 
                  ſecundae, Disput. 204. cap. 4. Deus ipſe efficere non poteſt, quin per inhaerentem iuſtitiam ſit dignus quiſ

                      aternâ vitâ, et ſi per abſolutam potentiam poſſit non dare. That is: God himſelfe cannot hinder, but that euery man is worthie of eternall life, out of his inherent righteouſnes, though out of his abſolute power he may refuſe to giue it him. I examine not this Diuinitie, how God may be vniuſt by his abſolute power, whereas his abſolute power doth not giue him that leaue, to denie his iuſtice, that is himſelfe, which I ſuppoſe he ſhould doe, if he denied rewards to them that haue deſerued them, and are worthie of them. But by this may be ſeene, whether the Biſhop be turned Papiſt yea or no, for ſtanding for Gods promiſe to ground our hope of heauen vpon, or rather whether 
                     Ʋalentia be not

turned Proteſtant, for holding ſo preciſely, that ſecluſo promiſſo, we haue no cauſe of confidence. Or, if that be Poperie, which 
                     Ʋalentia holdeth, and the Biſhop laies hold on, that we haue no right to heauen but for the promiſe, whether 
                     Ʋaſquez and Bellarmine ſauour not of a rancker contagion then ſo, that aduance vs to heauen, and to the higheſt fauour of God, out of the worth of what is within vs, though his promiſe were no where, though his pactum ſalis were cleane plowed downe. Can there be any thing more contrarie then the aforeſaid opinions are betweene themſelues? Or is not the Biſhop moſt conſtant, while the Ieſuites are thus at oddes, like the Armites, among themſelues? One of them beeing ſo humble, and ſo humbly conceiting of his owne ſufficiencies, as it ſeemes at leaſt, that you would thinke he might enter in euen through the needles eye; the others ſo ſwelling, as heauen it ſelfe, large though it be, is ſcarce able to containe them. But if this be their ſpeculation, about infuſed righteouſnes, which is Gods entire worke, what doe they thinke of their owne workes, trow you, which for certaine they will challenge more reward vnto, becauſe they are more voluntarie, and of their freer concurrence? And indeede the queſtion was betweene the Biſhop and the Cardinall, about the merit of works, not of habits. Theſe, make habits and all to be meritorious, one abſolutely ex naturâ rei, the other ſo as God cannot hinder condignitie, though he denie pay. Yet S. Paul not onely vilifies his habite of righteouſnes, Phil. 3. that I may be found in him, not hauing mine owne righteouſnes, but his workes of righteouſnes, Tit. 3. and which is more then both theſe, his ſufferings for righteouſnes, Rom. 8. He had plaied the Auditour, he had caſt vp his accounts, and his totall is what thinke you? 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. I find (ſaies he) by computation, or by exact caſting, that the preſent ſufferings of this tranſitorie life (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , they are ſo ſhort) they are not worthie of the glorie that ſhall be reuealed. He keepes the word, you ſee, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , they are not

worthie. Yet Vaſquez ſaies, God cannot 
                  The monſtrous giddineſſe of Vaſque
                           •
                        , in contradicting; God may denie reward, but not our deſert, ſaith he, whereas our deſert is none, but Gods reward moſt certain. And to be claimed too, eâ quae par eſt humilitate, as the Biſhop moſt excellently. That to be diſclaymed altogether. 
                  hinder their worthines, no not onely by his ordinarie power, but not by his abſolute, (though he may denie the wages by the later of theſe two, that is ſcarce iuſtly, or very vniuſtly onely, as I conceiue it.) But what ſaies Bellarmine? The Apoſtle (ſaies he) meanes, that the ſufferings here are temporall, the bliſſe to come eternall, and that betweene them there is no proportion. Now ſurely a worſhipfull ſolution, of an inſoluble authoritie. Whereas the Apoſtle does not ſay, they are not proportionable ratione durationis, but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that they are not worthie, which is the very queſtion. And was this a ſentence worthie of S. Pauls wiſdome, to tell vs that there is no proportion betweene finite and infinite? Who does not know that? We may ſay vnto him, as he does to Calvine in another place, about the wiſdome of 
                     Ʋlyſſes, pronouncing for Monarchies; Ad hoc certè pronunciandum non fuit opus ſapientiâ vel Pauli, vel Apoſtoli: De Pontif. Rom. l. 1. c. 2. The very Centurion, to whome the Iewes had giuen that teſtimonie, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , he is worthie, yet he ouerthroweth it in the ſame place againe, with 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , I did not count my ſelfe worthie, Luc. 7. 7. They thought him worthie that Chriſt ſhould come to him, when he does not thinke himſelfe worthie ſo much as to come to Chriſt. And not to come to him in earth, I ſay; yet into heauen trow you? to finde him out there too? As he muſt, if he meane to be ſaued by his works. But ſo is merit and worthines euery way hiſſed out, ſo is it one thing for the Iewes to ponder other bodies merits, another thing for the conſcience to weigh it ſelfe in vnpartiall ballance. The builder of the Synagogue is modeſter then the Iewes that enioy his buildings.
               § 17. Many things might be noted in the Adioynders diſcourſe, wherein he choakes himſelfe, though he indite the Biſhop of preuarisation. Num. 7. he ſaies, the Biſhop alludes to the pennie in the Gospells, that was giuen to the labourers, by

which the Fathers (as he confeſſeth) vnderſtand eternall life and ſaluation. He quotes Hierome in Iovinian, lib. 2. Aug. de Virgin. c. 26. Greg. in Iob. l. 4. c. 31. alſo the Commentaries vpon S. Matth. cap. 20. But if this be ſo, what more aduerſe to himſelfe? For if the pennie be but one, and all receiue that common pennie, then are we not ſaued by our works, which all that are ſaued are not furniſhed with alike, but ſome more, ſome leſſe, as is euident. It comes therefore of the goodnes of Almightie God alone, giuing mercedem diei horario operi, awhole daies wages for an houres worke, as the Biſhop moſt godlily. Can this be but of the free mercy of God, without reſpect to our merits, yea to our workes themſelues, though we entitle no merit to them?
               § 18. Numb. 11. he brings that for an example of meriting by workes, Centuplum &c. Matth. 19. a hundreth fold in this life. And if God doe not giue vs an hundreth fold in this life, I meane them that ſerue him in moſt deuout faſhion, doth he not reward merits, or doth he therefore come ſhort of paying the ſcore? Yet the Adioynder ſaies, we merit the centuplum to be paid vs in this life, becauſe our Sauiour promiſeth ſo. Whereas how many depart this life daily, without the receiuing of ſuch a pay, the hundreth fold pay, in temporall commodities? And are merits vnrewarded, ſhall we ſay, in all theſe? What is this but to doe as the Apoſtle complaines, Rom. 10. ſtatuentes ſuam iuſticiam, iuſticiae Dei non ſunt ſubiecti? [Seeking by all meanes to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſnes, they were not ſubiected to the righteouſnes of God.] We ſlander God, to flatter men, and wrong his ſcale to aduance ours. Saue that all is Centuplū, I grant, which we receiue here, though neuer ſo little, if we compare it with our merits. Whether it be ſo then or not, that the Centuplum is here paid, merit is daſht.
               § 19. In his 9. numb. he brings that out of Rom. 4. To him that worketh, the reward is imputed not according to grace, but according to debt. Why this? Becauſe the Biſhop had anſwered his other authoritie of vnuſquiſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      accipiet, Euery one

ſhall receiue reward according to his labour; I ſay, the Biſhop had anſwered it moſt pithily, and moſt properly, According to his labour, but not for his labour. It is the ſquare of the reward, but not the formall cauſe whereby. In genere comparatorum, non efficientium, as the worthy Biſhop moſt worthily had explained. By all which their inference of merit is confounded. To this then he oppoſes, that wages is of debt, not of grace, to him that worketh, Rom. 4. 4. Yet they are wont to ſay, both of grace and of debt: as they haue many more ſuch vntempered morterings, and mungrel daubings. Cornelius Muſſ. in his Comment. in 6. ad Rom. in the very end thus, ſpeaking of life eternall: Si deum reſpicias, ſemper eſt donum, nunquam ſtipendium, nunquam merces. In quantum enim redditur à Deo qui nullatenus debet, omnem meriti rationem excedit: that is, Eternall life if you reſpect God, is alwaies a gift, neuer wages, nor hire. For in ſomuch as God giues it, who is no way debter, it exceedes all proportion of deſert or merit.] Yet they haue found out a debet on Gods part; & who ſees not that all merit is daſht by Muſſ. his words, vnles they come in, and ſhew ſomewhat elſe, by which they may claime on their owne parts? ſith God is by no meanes to bee challenged, as he ſayes. Here the Adioynder would haue all to be of debt, and none of grace. Or elſe what doth that authoritie auaile him out of Rom. 4. Wages to the workeman, not of grace, but of debt. He kicks out grace, and caſheers it cleane, that there may be both debt, and a pure debt, and ſo merit. And doth not the Apoſtle force him to doe no leſſe, vnleſſe he let go merit? Doth he not ſay in effect, If of grace, not of debt, if of debt, not of grace; as in an other place hee affirmes, and that very formally, If of grace, not of workes, elſe grace were no grace; which is another place which ouerthroweth Rom. 11. 6. their merit cleane, becauſe the Adioynder will haue it not to be without grace at any hand, in his 12, numb. But euery bodie may ſee that S. Paul doth not apply this Rom. 4. to our ſtate as we are iuſtified, but to the naturall man that ſhould worke wonders, and winne heauen by his exact

righteouſneſſe, if any ſuch were. Therefore he diuides the worker from the beleeuer, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. But to him that beleeueth on him which iuſtifieth the vngodly, his faith is reputed for righteouſneſſe. By which we ſee the former words do not belong to vs, vnleſſe he will haue vs ſo to worke merits, as not to beleeue in God, nor to truſt in him which iuſtifieth the wicked. And behold what followes, in S. Paul, howe fauourable to merits, if we had leaſure to ſtand vpon it? God impures righteouſneſſe without workes, ſayes he, v. 6. And, Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are couered. It is a tale, that they would tell vs here, of the firſt and ſecond iuſtification. For where there is bleſſedneſſe, where this 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , whatſoeuer is ſecondarie, is fruſtrate and ſuperfluous. We cannot be better then happy. As all the world added to God doth not make him better, no more doth any addition encreaſe felicitie. Therefore once iuſtified, and iuſtified for good and all, perfectly iuſtified, there is no entitling of vs to any higher good. And ſo falls their diſtinction, which was coyned at firſt, to vphold their other rotten buildings from falling.
               § 20. The ſumme is. Wages to the worker without grace, ſaies the Apoſtle, or without fauour. Let it be ſo hardly. But that is pure merces then, ſtrict wages, wages of rigour, nothing ſtrayned, but properly ſo called. To ſhew that at other times when the Scripture vſeth the word wages, it ſpeakes not properly, nor would be thought to ſpeake ſo, but in a modified notion onely, imitating wages, becauſe wages comes laſt, and ſo the reward to vs after 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Epheſ. 6. 13. the true Gnekeb of which before. And you ſhall obſerue that the Scripture keepes the phraſe, for the moſt part, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeakes, Heb. 12. v. 5. 7. the one in dealing by vs, the other in cenſuring and pronouncing of vs. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , rewarding our obedience farre aboue our deſerts. For he deales with vs as with Sonnes. Now inheritances are not purchaſed, but freely giuen to them of the

blood, IT IS YOVR FATHERS PLEASVRE, Luk. 12. And againe, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , he calls ſtrabones paetos, looking vpon vs through the ſpectacles of loue, and commends our worke aboue the worth. He may ſay, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , they are worthy; but we with the Centurion, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , I did not count my ſelfe worthy; non minùs veraciter quàm humiliter, not of lying humilitie, but godly ſinceritie, (the diſtinction that the holy Fathers haue vſed long agoe to preuent cauill, in this verie queſtion.) Though 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Luk. 20. 35. and againe, 21. 36. and 2. Theſſ. 1. 5. expounds 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , not of dignitie, but of dignation, not of them that are worthy, but are reputed to be worthy.
               § 21. I haſt to his laſt, and yet loe I am croſſed with another obiection creeping forth like a gloe-worme out of a hedge. Dignus eſt operarius mercede ſuâ, the labourer is worthie of his hire. Therefore merit. But this is ſpoken of Miniſters deſeruing maintenance at their peoples hands, whome they attend and ſerue, Matth. 10. 10. Luk. 10. 7. 1. Tim. 5. 18. not of God who is debter to none, nemini debitor, rather all the world obnoxious to him. Are not theſe ſtout probates of the Adioynder for Merits?
               
               § 22. But now, num. 12. (with which I will end) when he ſeemes to be moſt acute, then he is fouleſt of all other. Becauſe God by his grace helpes vs to worke, and we cannot worke as we are of our ſelues, therefore wee merit by reaſon of Gods concurrence. This is more then Pelagius euer meant to diſhonour God by, when he denyed grace, and pleaded ſo ſtrongly for naturall abilities. For it is worſe to ſhoot at God with his owne arrowes, and to raiſe merit out of grace, then out of free will. Shall we ſee how many reaſons fight againſt this concluſion? Firſt, wee doe but little good, rarius exit, ſcarce one in a thouſand, S. Cyrill (of whom before) Catech. 5. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,. i. Moſt things we do are worthy of condemnation. (This is more then Venial ſinnes.) And deſcribing the forme of their ſeruice at Communion, hee ſayes of God,' 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . ibid.. i. God in benefitting vs doth not a iuſtice, but a thing aboue all iuſtice, viz. becauſe aboue all deſert. Indeed, if we be in hell, then Iuſtè nos hîc, as the good theefe ſaid; but if, in bonis, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , More then our right.
                   as Iob ſpeaketh. Then ſpotted and imperfect, ſi fortè quid, when it comes at laſt, like Iacobs lambs. Sicut pannus menſtruatae, ſic iuſtitiae ipſae noſtrae. Thirdly due, though

it were neuer ſo excellent or exact. Due to our Creator, due to our Redeemer, euery way due, as one that hath the dominion ouer all that wee either haue or are. Who of you will thanke his ſeruant? ſayes our Sauiour. Inter Dominum & ſeruum non eſt iuſtitia, ſayes Ariſtotle, much leſſe merit, and merit de rigore. Fourthly, though they were not due, yet becauſe God helpes vs, and God aſſiſts vs, orels they can be none (omnia opera noſtra operatus es in nobis Domine) therefore merit is turned out at that gate too. And yet the Adioynders 
                  Chryſ. in Matth. 5. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , &c. God euermore giues rewards aboue our deſignes (for S. Chryſoſtome knew no Popiſh deſerts.) reaſon for merit is grace, but very reaſonleſſe. Laſtly, Improportionable to that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that downe waighing reward, 2. Cor. 4. 17. and Luk. 6. 38. menſura ſuperefluēs, exceeding (merit.) 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , they are not worthy, as before was ſhewed out of Rom. 8.
               § 23. After all this, it will be ſaid perhaps, nay after all this it is ſayd, num. 12. in the latter ende, that the Biſhop neuertheleſſe graunts the Adioynders doctrine about Merits of works, & diuers other important points of their catholique relligion. Why then doe they carpe his writings ſo bitterly, I would faine knowe, and the Adioynder among the firſt? They haue rayled againſt many, they haue traduced all that came in their way, the champions ſpecially, the Iew

               § 25. IN his foureteenth Numb. he belches forth a freſh that fame ſtale crapula of his, (it deſerues no better) that God is honoured in his ſeruants honour. As if therefore we might adore them too, and keep no meaſure, or at leaſt deferre relligious worſhippe. Honos ſeruorum redundat ad Dominum, 
                  Quoted by the Adioynd. here. ſaith S. Hierome; it is true, but not adoratio. There may be therfore a nimis, in honouring thoſe whom God moſt dearly loues. Euen the Aſſe in Aeſop kiſſed his owner, thinking hee did well, but was iuſtly reputed a lowt for his paines. Yet the Adioynder is earneſt for our kiſſing of relliques in moſt deuout faſhion, Numb. 16. Origen refutes this obiection of the Papiſts, in the Paynim Celſus, (lib. 8. quoted by me before) that we muſt worſhip creatures to pleaſe God, glorifie them, to gratifie him; the Church which is Chriſts ſpouſe lying with Chriſts friends, (the Sodales in the Canticles) for Chriſts ſake, as the Biſhop moſt wittily, and no leſſe godlyly retorted after the Scripture phraſe, that makes idolatrizing, whoring, and our Faith to God the flower of our Chaſtity. Why doth not the Adioynder refute that compariſon? For the wife, though ſhe giue entertainement to her huſbands friends, yet ſhe muſt beware how ſhe giue them her husbands honour, which is worſhip and veneration betweene Chriſt and his Church. Cui gloriam, ei omnia, ſaies Euthymius. And God by Eſay, had ſaid as much before. 
                     In Matth. Non dabo alteri.
               
               § 26. But the 15. num. ſalues this ſweetly; I will ſet downe his wordes. Relligious honour hath beene often exhibited to Angells and holy Men, with the tearme of adoration, and with the exhibition of a corporall reuerence. (So as he abhors not from relligious adoration of Angells and holy men:

But he goes forward.) Which may be more or leſſe according to the deuotion of the exhibiters thereof (belike he leaues the matter to euery mans diſcretion) to giue more or leſſe thereafter as they are diſpoſed, ſo that it be in their minde and intention diſtinguiſhed from diuine honour, due to God alone. In which intention, conſiſteth &c. See we to what this doctrine leadeth? That we may giue any honour, and to any one, alike; God or man, Saint or Angell, pilgrim or triumphant, (it is well that the reprobates and the deuills come not in too) onely prouided, that our intentions be right. They muſt Why not Sacrifice too, with different intent
                           •…
                        ?
                   be varied, though the act be all one, and then it is well enough, for the reſt the Adioynder will carrie you out. For the intention is that which differeth and diſtinguiſheth all. And in his 6. Num. he is content to take in the adoration of the Kings of Perſia too, either to iuſtifie, or to exemplifie this conceit of his; which Mardocheus is thought to haue denied to Haman out of a godly zeale, and Origen condemnes in his 8. againſt Celſus very directly (as I haue quoted before) and a certaine Embaſſadour, wiſer then his fellowes, let fall his ring, and tooke it vp againe, with ſuch a bending Plutarch. of the bodie as is meete in the like caſe, when he came in the preſence of the Perſian King, pretending worſhip ſo, but doing none. So much more tender are the heathen ſometimes, of the diuine honour, then the Adioynder Chriſtian, and Catholike, as he would be thought, confounding all actions of honour and reuerence both towards God and man, ſo the intention doe but turne as it were vpon a pinne, which way it ſhould. May I not ſay, as the Biſhop moſt acutely vrgeth them (when he examines their poſition, that there is no peculiar honour to God reſerued, but onely ſacrifice,)

                   that by this meanes we may offer the Maſſe to the Maſſe, not onely to God, nay nor onely to the Virgin, or to Saints and Angels, ſo our intentions be ſound? But he ſaies in the concluſion of his 15. Num. that for ſo much as the Biſhop confeſſeth a certaine honour to be due to holy relliques (meaning they ſhould be honourably laid vp in the ground, not ventis &

ſolibus, much leſſe feris atque alitibus, to be left at random) he cannot with reaſon exclude from the ſame, corporall reuerence. And yet the Apoſtle ſaies, we put more honour vpon our vncomely parts, 1. Cor. 12. 23. euen as relliques are buried 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that they would haue, vnleſſe they were hid out of ſight. And does corporall reuerence follow to be giuen, from S. Pauls honour which he allots to theſe parts? But the Adioynder is not content with corporall reuerence, but he ſaies we cannot exclude from them ANY corporall reuerence (be it what it will be) ſo the intention be to doe a relligious worſhip, and not a diuine, to them.

               § 27. In his 16. Num. he tells vs certaine tales of proceſſions, but by the way implies, that the word proceſſion, is but very late. As now we tearme it, ſaith he; I beleeue the thing then is not very auncient. I ſhewed before out of Theoderets hiſtorie, with what manner of proceſſion, Babylas bodie was remooued by the Chriſtians from Daphne to Antioch. The people cried, all the way as they went, Confounded be all they that worſhip carued images. And would this ſentence agree with the Popiſh proceſſions? But the queſtion was not, betweene the Biſhop and the Cardinall, about proceſſion, but adoration of relliques. Did he want matter, trow you, that he ſtuffes in this, or is the conſequence good from the one to the other?

Others at Minich for ſooth, and in Valentia of Spaine, ſtraunge feats wrought at a Prieſts bodie (notable ſaies the margent) that died in Aprill laſt. For as in Madrigalls, ſo in miracles, alwaies the laſt mocke the vulgar moſt.—

T. that he may be the man, offers his ſeruice, like Ticelius vnder Pope Leo, whome Luther ſcared. Nay, we are all of vs gone at common Law (he thinks) that can ſhew no miracles ſo long together in our Church, not ſo much as a lame dogge, or a ſicke cat healed in all our Congregations, notwithſtanding our liuely and ſtrong faith, that we are wont ſo much to vaunt of. Thus he. And ſpecially, ſince the Biſhop grants miracles to haue beene done at S. Stephens bodie in S. Auſtens time (the Biſhop meant he would not reiect S. Auſtens report, and yet he repelleth their idolatries about the worſhipping of relliques ſufficiently otherwaies: for, non ſequitur conſequentia à miraculis ad cultum, witnes Bellarmine himſelfe, lib. 4. c. 14. de Not is Eccl.) but, if he graunt that miracles were done then, he muſt either ſhew why they haue ceaſed ſince, (ſaith the Adioynder) or at leaſt prooue that all the Popiſh miracles whereof their Church boaſteth, are no better then ſpectra, and diabolicall illuſions. A taske not ſo difficult perhaps, but that the number is ſo infinite. Though why ſhould not himſelfe, or one of his fellowes, approoue the ſoundnes of them, rather then wee diſprooue them, ſince they bring thoſe miracles for ſo many argumēts of their doughtie relligion, which they call Catholike, we know to be counterfeit? The law of diſputation beeing, as I remember, for the opponent to prooue, the defendant to anſwer onely, and to reſiſt. But the Adioynders diſcontinuance ſo long from the Vniuerſities, hath diſpoſſeſſed him of theſe and all other good

notions. Neither doe I ſee any reaſon, why the Biſhop granting that there were miracles don in S. Auſtens time, ſhould be bound to acknowledge their continuance till now, or ſhew a reaſon of their ceaſing (as the Adioynder would faine charge vpon him,) vnleſſe they likewiſe prooue, that thoſe miracles beginning with the Apoſtles time, cōtinued in the Church without any intermiſſion, from the primitiue till S. Auſtens daies; which as yet they haue not done. For Bellarmine attempting it, Lib. 4. cap. 14. de Notis Eccl. is both otherwiſe at a loſſe, and failes moſt groſſely in the ſecond hundreth of yeares. In all which time, he hath but one miracle, viz. that of the Chriſtiā ſouldiers vnder Marcus Aurelius, obtaining raine at the inſtance of their prayers, after a long and great drought.

If faith were currant therefore in the Church of Rome, they would call for no miracles to commend it. And the ſame S. Auſten again, Tract. 13. in Ioh. inſults ouer the Donatiſts, and their pretending to doe miracles, and calls them, mirabiliarij, or miracle-mongers, by contempt. De vnitate, alſo, Eccleſ. c. 16. he reiects not the Donatiſts onely, and their miracles, but ſuch as are ſaid to be done in the Catholike Church, from hauing any force to demonſtrate the Church, as the Adioynder would. Non ideò manifeſtatur Eccleſia, ſaith hee, quia haec talia [miracula] in ea fiunt. [The doing of miracles, though they be true miracles, is no note of the Church.] This is a flint that Bellarmine mumps at, and cannot get downe with any chewing. To which finally may be added, another teſtimonie of the ſame S. Auſten, contra Fauſt. Manich. lib. 12. c. 45. where he preferres the prophecies that went of Chriſt in Scripture, before miracles, though neuer ſo illuſtrious, as which are more ſubiect to cauillation, then Scripture Oracles. His words are: Etſi atteſtabantur miracula doctrinae Apoſtolicae, attamen non defuiſſent, ſicut etiam nunc adhuc quidam muſſitant, qui magicae potentiae cuncta illa tribuerent, niſi talis eorum cogitatio conteſtatione prophetica vinceretur. Magicis enim artibus longè antequam naſcerentur, prophetas ſibi conſtituere à quibus praenunciarentur, nemo vtique diceret. That is, [Although there were miracles which bare witnes to the truth of the Apoſtles doctrine, yet there would haue been ſome (as there are alſo now) who would haue aſcribed thoſe

things to certaine Magicall arts or feates, vnleſſe that wicked ſurmiſe of theirs had been beaten and battered downe, with the teſtimonies of the holy Prophets: for no man could ſay (though diſpoſed to cauill) that Chriſt by Magicke, could appoint himſelfe certaine Prophets long before hee was borne, who ſhould foretell of him, &c.] S. Chryſoſtome ſayes euidently, in 1. ad Cor. cap. 2. hom. 6. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Miracles are forbidden in theſe dayes, or, miracles are at a ſtay now, chooſe you whether: for the authoritie is pregnant againſt you both waies. And he affirmes, that the Church is the better for beeing without them, without ſicke dogges healed, and lame cattes cured by your minikin-miracles, done at Minich, and Sichem, Sir. Make your peace with Chryſoſtome firſt, and then come and wrangle with vs hardly. The ſame Father remembring, that S. Paul had ſaid, that Anti-chriſt ſhould come in lying wonders and miracles (not yours I warrant you) he notes vpon the place before quoted, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) who can cure cattes and dogges, I warrant you, with a wet finger, from ſuch as proceed from the operation of the holy Ghoſt. But what can be more powerfull, then the obſeruation of the ſame Chryſostome vpon Tit. 1. that, if wee marke well the ſtorie of the Acts of the Apoſtles, we ſhall ſee moſt men were conuerted by their doctrine and preaching, before euer they came to the working of miracles. So Iohn did no miracle, Ioh. 10. 41. as they confeſſe in the Goſpel, and yet drew the multitudes forcibly after him. Neuertheleſſe Iohn came with a newe doctrine. In his laſt Homely vpon the Acts, the ſame Chryſoſtome thus, (that ye may ſee what a friend he was to miracles.) 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. This is a great miracle, ſaies he, to bring an argument from the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles. By which reaſon, I beleeue, wee ſhall haue more miracles in our Church, then are ſtirring in the Popiſh, whatſoeuer ſtore of lame dogges are healed there, or ſicke cats,
                  
as this wretch ſcoffeth from his chaire of ſcorners. S. Gregorie 
                  
                     Sa, Scholijs in Euang. Matth. the great, as he is quoted by Immanuel Sa. in 4. Matth. notes moſt excellently, that our Sauiour when he faſted forty dayes together, not without a great miracle, yet beeing oppugned by the deuill, repelled him by Scripture, and not by miracle. Yet then if euer, were miracles to be brought for the auouching of the truth. Specially ſince the deuill went to tempt him with hunger, our Sauiour was to foile him with his miracle of faſting. Neuertheleſſe, Scriptum eſt, there carried it, though the deuill craftily had begunne with it, to diuert our Sauiour from the vſe of that which he had profaned. And the ſame S. Gregorie againe, Hom. 29. in Euang. makes it a ſigne of the Churches infancie, to be tittled with miracles; as S. Chryſoſtome had alſo ſaid in another place, that the Apoſtles Comm in Epiſt. Rom. & Cor. were not alwaies to be conuerſant with Chriſt, like the nurſe-child with his nurſe, nor fed with pappe, but to trie

                   their fortunes, and to goe abroad into the world, and to ſhift for themſelues. S. Gregories words are, Nunquidnā fratres mei, quòd iſta ſigna non facitis, minime creditis? Sed haec neceſſaria in exordio Eccleſiae fuerunt. Ʋt enim fides creſceret, miraculis fuerat nutrienda.

Linguae in ſignum ſunt, non fidelibus, ſed infidelibus. That is, [Shall I ſay you beleeue not now, my deare brethren, becauſe you do none of theſe miracles? But miracles were needefull in the beginnings of the Church. To the ende that faith might growe vp, it was to be fed with miracles. For euen we, when we ſet trees, we water them no longer, then till they haue taken roote. And when once they are rooted, our watring of them is at an end. Hence ſaith S. Paul, Tongues are for a token, (or for a ſigne, or monument) not to the beleeuers, but to the vnbeleeuers.] Thus Gregorie. And hee might haue added that out of 1. Cor. 13. 8. Whether they be tongues, they ſhall ceaſe, &c. meaning miracles; and ceaſe, not in heauen onely, but

in the ſtate of the new Teſtamēt (for I willingly ioyne with them that conſtrue it ſo) that by tongues, we may vnderſtād, omne prodigioſum, euen all miracles, the genus by the ſpecies, no vnuſuall ſchematiſme. And whereas I quoted Sa the Ieſuite ſo lately, a man of your function (and no leſſe of your faction) I think it not amiſſe to bring to your remembrance another ſaying of his. Among his Aphoriſmes, V. Revelatio, thus he hath; that Revelations (which you abound with, witneſſe Bridget, and Catharine, and diuers more) are not raſhly to be credited or entertained, but ſubmitted to iudgement, and tried by their conformitie with the Catholike doctrine. Shall not miracles then abide the touch ſtone much more? Which if they doe, then is not the doctrine to be grounded vpon miracles, but miracles to preuaile as farre as the doctrine ſhall giue leaue. For who knowes but God does many things to trie vs, Deuter. 13. and ſuch aſſaults are giuen oft-times to the Church, out of Gods deepe prouidence, (vt cognoſcantur probati, that the approoued may be knowne, 1. Cor. 11. 19.) as it indangers the very faith of the elect? By all which, and much more that here I omit, you may ſee what reaſon the worthy Biſhop had, not to ſtand vpon thoſe words (which you quarrell him for not ſetting downe) of the Cardinals text, (as if they were ought to the queſtion, or as if hee were to buſie himſelfe with impertinent matters for lacke of employment.) For my part, I am content to inſert thoſe words here, as much as they are extant in your Num. 18. Adioynd. booke. Reſpondes: Miracula diuina, &c. In Engliſh thus, that all may take knowledge of them. I anſwer, ſaith the Cardinall, that diuine miracles are ſeen onely among the Catholiques. And becauſe the Biſhop would not ruſh into this new branglement, therefore you thinke he left out thoſe words fraudulently. And yet Simon Magus made a dead man to wagge his head, when he ſtroue with S. Peter, (as we read in Euſebius) which is more then to cure a lame dogge.

                   tainted with the damnable hereſie of Macedonius, God

forbid that any ſuch ſhould cleaue to vs, though malice her ſelfe were to cenſure. Eutychianus the Novatiā, did a famous miracle vnder Conſtantine, whome he drew to fauour him, and to owne his acquaintance, by healing certaine ſickneſſes, and by other rare acts (they call them miracles) which he performed. Namely, that beeing to ſue to the aforeſaid Conſtantine, for the releaſe of a priſoner (who was in daunger to die, by reaſon of the many irons that he was laden with, euen before he could make ſuit for him to the Emperour) he procured his chaines to fall off from him of their owne accord, (not without miracle) and afterward obtained his pardon of Conſtantine. Witneſſe here of Sozom. lib. 1. cap. 14. And Paulus another Biſhop of the Novatian ſect, did another miracle no leſſe ſtrange, (witneſſe Socrat. lib. 7. cap. 17.) conuincing a certaine Iew (who wickedly and craftily had often procured himſelfe to be baptized) by a miraculous annihilation, or diſparence at leaſt, of the water in the font, euen readie for the baptiſme. Now beleeue falſe teachers the rather for miracles, whether in ſtraw or in ſtone; or our doctrine the leſſe, becauſe we bragge of no ſuch, though it lacke not this ſeale, oftentimes, ſet vpon it, by Gods owne hand, but that we haue a firmer euidence. S. Auſten in his whole chapter de Civit. Dei, which here you quote, viz. l. 22. cap. 8. neuer ſtands for miracles to prooue new doctrines by, but onely the old (as was declared before,) and therefore you ſhall gaine nothing from thence, who alleadge new miracles to authorize new articles, as praying to Saints, worſhipping of Relliques, and ſuch like conceits, though we ſhould ſubſcribe to all that S. Auſten reports, with no leſſe promptnes, then your ſelues, that is more then himſelfe may be well thought to doe. For one time he confeſſeth of the aforeſaid wonders, that non ſunt tanta authoritate commendata &c. They are not of ſuch authoritie as ſtraitwaies to be beleeued, though betweene one faithfull man and another. Another time he ſaies, that as ſoone as they are told they are cleane forgotten, and no bodie relates them to them that did

not heare them, as they were rehearſed de libello, nor no bodie remembers them any long time himſelfe. His words are: Nec [admodum] innoteſcunt, neque vt non excidant animo, quaſi glarea memoriae erebra lectione tunduntur. Whereas if they were diuine miracles, why ſhould they not be divulged throughout the whole world, euen where ſoeuer the Goſpell it ſelfe is preached, as our Sauiour ſaid of the charitie of that good woman, which annointed his feete? Againe, Semel hoc audiunt qui adſunt, plureſ

Laſtly, as for the flowres which were wont to be applied to Relliques (as you tell vs) and from thence drew meruailous curing vertue, let S. Auſten himſelfe iudge what you ſay, or though himſelfe ſaid it. In the 8. booke of the aforeſaid worke, cap. 27. he allowes not of meates to be ſet vpon Martyrs tombes, for obtaining of bleſſing. A Chriſtianis melioribus (ſaith he) hoc non fit. He denies not but it is done, but he ſaies the better ſort of Chriſtians doe it not. Much leſſe flowres to be laid vpon their bodies, and taken off againe, with hope of vertue to proceede from them in application to ſicke folks. For of ſanctifying meates to neceſſarie vſe, we read in the Apoſtle, (and the Martyrs might concurre to it, if they were conſcious:) but of flowres no where, nor to no ſuch purpoſe, ſpecially from the dead. The Chriſtians then might doe this in S. Auſtens time, but not the better ſort of Chriſtians, as he moſt aduiſedly ſpeakes; not Meliores Chriſtiani.

Though this laſt be ſtarke falſe, that miracles done at Saints bodies, inferre the honour which you challenge to them, by any probable conſequence, as Bellarmine denies about Ieremies bodie, and was quoted to you a little before out of his de Notis Eccleſiae, yet inſiſting vpon the words that you bring out of the Biſhop, let me aske you in good earneſt, what makes ſo much for you in all that enumeration, that you ſhould ſay, you deſire no more then he graunteth?

                  needs be relligious honour, which is not done for ciuill reſpects, but proceedes out of deuotion, and tendes directly to the honouring of God, though we honour in this faſhion euen liuing men, and earthly Saints, whoſe holines may be counterfeit, for ought we know, and whoſe ende may be damnation, whereas the relligious honour ſhould not goe but with beatitude, as Bellarmine therefore entitles his maine controuerſie about that point, De Beatitudine Sanctorum; yet what is this, I ſay, to adoration? You honour pietie it ſelfe, iuſtice, mercie, when you

heare or reade any thing vertuouſly done in any of theſe kinds, yet not with cappe and knee, as you ſpeake, not with ciuill honour, like the Burgeſſe of ſome towne, I hope. Doe you adore it therefore?

Chryſ. verdict) then are obſerued de facto, & meet to be obſerued, in the generall of Chriſtianitie, emongſt all that belong to the myſticall bodie, Men or women, Clerks, or lay, though your Monks like mungrells are neither of them both, but Minotaures, and mixtum genus, many times,—prole

                  , they that came without virginitie (if fraught and flouriſhing with other fruits of righteouſnes) were moſt honourably and moſt comfortably receiued by him. And are receiued no doubt daily. Where, becauſe I ſpake of the viſitations of Nonneries a little before, you may call to minde, what happened here in England, long before King Henrie the eights daies, whome you haue not yet forgiuen his diſmiſſing of your ſiſters, and demoliſhing their cloiſters, though God knowes it was high time: But I meane, vnder the raigne of

King Henry the third (as Matthew Paris, with other hiſtorians recordeth) that the virginitie of your Nonnes was faine to be explored, by certain viſitors in Commiſſion (for repreſſing the ſcandall) euen by nipping of their dugges, to ſee if any milke would come out, to detect their incontinencies. Such vnnaturall remedies, did the vnreaſonable courſes, then held by your ſiſter-hoods, driue the Magiſtrate vnto. But it is enough forvs, that Chryſoſtome not onely cenſures the profeſſed of his time, which neuertheleſſe were not halfe ſo rancke and ſo degenerate, as haue yours been ſince, but denyes Monkerie to come of God, or of diuine inſtitution, when it is at the beſt. There was not then (ſaies he) a footesprint of a Monke in all the Church. And againe, Monkerie is no matter of Chriſtian faith or doctrine. What meruaile then, if a plant not planted by God (the heauenly husbandman) Matth. 15. 13. be afterwards rooted out, when it turnes intollerable? And I inſiſt the willing lier vpon Chryſoſtomes authoritie, (though I might alleadge many others, if I were

And Remigius moſt excellently, vpon thoſe words of the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 6. 14. State ſuccincti lumbos in veritate, hauing your loines girt about with truth: With truth (ſaies he) becauſe nothing does ſo encroach vpon the profeſſions of ſtrictnes, (to their vtter diſgrace) as diſſimulation and hypocriſie, contrary to truth. Yet your Cordeleirs weare reſtem pro veritate, a rope about their loines, (the very habite of hypocriſie and extreame diſguiſement) in ſtead of that Lumbi in veritate 
                  ſinceritie, which the Apoſtle here preſcribeth as the comelieſt ornament for a Monks backe. Before S. Chryſoſtomes time alſo, the Councell of Gangra (an auncient Councell) finds wefts in Monks, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , pretending holineſſe to their deeds of ſlothfulneſſe, or of cruell vnnaturalneſſe, in abandoning their owne parents, vnder colour of conſcience, and freedome of contemplation, Can. 16. or elſe neglecting their children, as it is Can. 15.

Cyprian, auncienter then any yet named, de Duplici Martyrio (if at leaſt that be his booke) he continues the ſame diſtinction, as it were of Ieremies two baskets, the one full of good and holeſom figs, the other moſt ſowre and moſt diſtaſtfull (as commonly it comes to paſſe, that the corruption of the beſt prooues the diſmalleſt) ſo of Monachi, qui verè Monachi ſunt, & Virgines, quae verè Virgines ſunt; that is, of Monks which are Monkes indeed, and Ʋirgins which are chaſt and Virgins indeede. Neque enim locus deſertus, ſaccus pro veſte, &c. ſed caeteris omnibus perditiores ſe produnt. And, His tectus involucris ſublitet animus valde mundanus. And he expounds to the ſame ſenſe, Saint Pauls words euen as we doe, Bodily exerciſe profiteth little, viz. that of the Monasteries: and that Satan transformed into an Angel of light, deceiues the ſimple, with lying gloſes, and ſhewes of ſanctimonie, quum intus madeant ſpiritualibus vitijs, whiles inwardly they lie ſoaking in ſpirituall corruptions.

And  the Egyptians, ſaies S. Chryſoſtome, that in former times were of all men moſt giuen to gluttonie, (whereupon I ſuppoſe it is, that Orus Apollo Niliacus thus reports, that at the burial In Hieroglyph. of their dead, they teare in peices the belly or the maw, of the partie deceaſed, and crie ouer it with great deteſtation,

                  Thou art he that caſt this man away, thou haſt vndone him, &c.) but as I was ſaying out of Chryſoſtome, it is his obſeruation of the Monks that liued in Egypt, that the nation which was formerly moſt infamous for intemperancies, was now become the moſt abſtinent of all other. Doe we maruell, if the Cardinall left out this? Or would this agree with Popiſh Monks?  He ſaies againe, that Palaeſtine had the prerogatiue of ſenioritie touching true relligion, and the worſhipping of God, but that the Egyptians haue gone beyond them for all that, though their punies in time. And would this make for Captaine Bellarmines turne, that ſtands ſo much vpon his 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as S. Chryſoſtome here calls it, that is, vaunts of his antiquitie, and the matrix Eccleſia? T  hat the Egyptians reioycing in the  faith of Chriſt, pittie their forefathers, that liued and died vnder errour, and preferre the truth, though but lately reuealed to them, before the damnable impieties that they were bred and brought vp in. Would this become a Ieſuits mouth?  Laſtly,  that where Pharaoh once ruffled in his tyrannies, there the Monke Antonie now flouriſhes in holines, and in all manner of Chriſtian and diuine vertues, prophecying alſo of Arius, and his execrable hereſie to ouerſpread the Church, which came to paſſe but euen too truly. Does not this ſhew the force of Popiſh Succeſſion? But omitting by-matters, hold we cloſe to the point: that Bellarmines Monks, and Chryſoſtomes Monks, are no more like one another, then Ieremies two baskets were betweene themſelues, in regard of the fruit that they contained. Which alteration alſo came to paſſe, I ſay, in S. Chryſoſtomes time, though afterwards it grew to more intolerable exceſſe, during the Popiſh ſuperſtition, as if hell had broke looſe, and the channells of the round world had beene diſcouered, the Catarractes broken open, or the Angel of the pit had done his office, as it is in the Revelation, caſting ſmoake, and ſending forth Locuſts. Theſe things beeing ſo, what maruell now, if he that had formerly ſo admired the Monks, (whiles they kept their firſt ſtanding) turned his ſtyle, and changed his iudgement,

vpon their ſo baſe and diſhonourable turning? When the gold became droſſ

And leaſt you thinke I haue miſapplied thoſe ſentences of Chryſoſtome, they are ſpoken by him of the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.

For can we imagine them to haue beene any better, then as the paradiſes of God, when we lament

their deſolation and vaſtation moſt? Yet deſperate diſeaſes and vncurable maladies, were the cauſes (ſayes S.

And the reaſon that prickt forward this miſcreant to ſuch a wickednes, was nothing but the Cardinals too great ſeueritie, in reforming certaine vices of a looſe Brother-hood, which this wretch could not endure, with three more of the principall, that ſet him on worke, and hired him, (as the Storie ſaies,) quadraginta argenteis, with fourtie ſiluerlings, as if ſo much preciouſer then our Sauiour Chriſt. For this cauſe Pius quintus plaied King Henrie the eight, and reformed them after the ſort that you cannot heare of with patience, pluckt them cleane vp. We read in the ſame booke of no leſſe then twelue Abbies at this Cardinalls

Of Chryſoſtome I told you before, Hom. 8. in ad Hebr. that if marriage and Monkerie may not ſtand together, all is ſpoild. Therefore your Church hath ſpoild all, or there is nothing left vn-ſpoild in your Church, that hath diuided theſe. As for the Canon that forbids Monks to marrie, Calched.

                  . The libertie of courteſie or relaxation is reſerued for the Biſhop of the place. So as ſtill the Monke may keepe his wife, and the Virgin her husband. As for Pouertie; Alvarus Pelagius de planctu Eccl. lib. 1. cap. 46. Abdication of proprietie is not eſſentiall to Monkerie. For in Egypt and Palaeſtine, the Monks there vſually both bought and ſold. Yea, Paulus ille ſummus Monachus, proprium habuit & teſtamentum fecit: Paul the Arch-Monke, had ſomewhat proper, and made a will. This ſpeakes Alvarus of the Monks of Egypt, which were thoſe whome Chryſoſtome ſo praiſed euen now, and from whome Bellarmine would commend his owne. And for Obedience, which is the third, Caietane makes ſuch a diuorce betweene perfection, and that, in 2. 2. Quaeſt. 86. art. 5. that he preferres the Biſhop there afore the Monke, though the

Therfore theſe are not linked in ſo neere a band, as you would make folkes beleeue; but are ſeparable from one another, the vowe from Monkerie, (aske but Salomon of this, Eccleſiaſt. 5. or Dauid, Pſal. 119.) and Monkery from the vowe, and Perfection from them all, while your Euangelicall Counſels appeare no where.

Thus you thinke you may perſwade your ſchollers within the grate, doubly captiued, (that haue neither mind to ſtudy, nor opportunity to ſearch, nor yet iudgement to diſcerne) that the doubtfull Dionyſius is a man of ſuch authoritie.

For we renounce the world in Baptiſme all of vs, and yet all doe not bind themſelues in theſe three vowes; not onely ours, but not yours. Haue you not many that are baptized among you, and yet no

                  es then you prooue it, by thoſe other words, that the Monks of that time made a ſolemne promiſe to embrace, as you ſay, a Monaſticall life: Ergo, Monkery includes the three vowes, of pouertie, chaſtitie, and obedience. But is this a ſound ſequele? Or is it any thing but the Elench of Petitio principij? For ſhame E. T. bind your broom-ſtickes together better, or be aduiſed that you are not for this trade of ſyllogizing.

But whatſoeuer it be, there is no vow in Dionyſ. no not of that which we vow in Baptiſme, nor againe of Monkerie in him that turns Monk. And yet how ſmal a thing were that, if it could be euicted? or what would that make for the three vowes, which you ſay Monkery neceſſarily importeth, we deny?

               § 36. As for the ſentences of Luther that you quote out of him (a noſe-gay, as you thinke, of ſomewhat vnſauoury flowers) they haue been explained ouer and ouer by our Diuines; they import no ſuch beaſtlineſſe as you would wreſt them to. Who knowes not Luthers manner of deliuering his conceits? As Socrates is ſaid to haue had his pi
                        •
                     gues ſimilitudines. And S. Paul, beeing to make oppoſition

againſt the Law, which the Iewes ſo magnified, turnes euery thing into a Law: Lex peccati, Lex mortis, &c. ſparing no words, giuing the raines to his libertie. So Luther. Whereupon Harding charges him, with denying magiſtracie among Chriſtians, becauſe he ſaies in one place, Inter Chriſtianos magiſtratus nullus eſt, or ſome ſuch thing. Which is no more then Chryſoſtome hath, Rex & ſubditus apud Chriſtianos nomina mera ſunt, Orat. 2. in Babylam: King and ſubiect are but meere names among Chriſtians; namely, in matters between God and the conſcience. For, I pray, what difference is there when once it comes thither? Does not the King as well as the ſubiect begge pardon of God? And I haue obſerued euen the Fathers, to couple marriage with other naturall neceſſities, which here you carpe Luther for. I hope the Phyſitians will not greatly be againſt this, whom your Medina appeales to, in the triall of this queſtion, lib. 4. de Continentia ſacrorum hominum, controu. 4. and we are not afraid to follow him. But theſe flim-flammes would ſoone vaniſh of their owne accord, if you would but leaue cauilling to diſgrace the perſon, and indifferently looke into the interpretation of our meanings. I haue reade another of you that exclaimes againſt Luther for thoſe words, wherein he confeſſes of himſelfe in the bitterneſſe of his ſoule, that he takes more delight in eating, drinking, and ſleeping, then in the paſſion and reſurrection of our Sauiour Chriſt: Behold an Epicure, ſaith he, by his owne confeſſion, a belly-god, &c. And I remember a good Gentleman, that was ſtumbled with theſe words (cited as it ſeemes in one of your Pampheleters) and thought the collection to bee verie ſound. No, God knowes: but as Anna ſaid to Eli, Ego foemina triſtis corde; ſo he, I am a man ſad at the heart, deploring his ſinfulneſſe, and agaſt at his owne wretchedneſſe, which the Papiſts are none troubled with, ſpecially the Ieſuites, that view their face in the glaſſe of flatteries. As we read in another place alſo of the ſame Luther, where ſpeaking of the good theife, and his noble confeſſion of Chriſt

vpon the croſſe, he ſticks not to ſay, Certe ego non facerem, Surely this is more then I ſhould haue done, if I had beene in his place: Loe, new matter for you to cauill at in Luther.
               
               § 37. Now to drawe to a concluſion. As for Bucer, he is ſo farre from denying that we may pray to God for chaſtitie, yea maidenly chaſtitie (though you quote his Commentarie vpon Matth. 1. and Matth. 19. as containing ſuch conceits, but moſt iniuriouſly) as you ſhall now heare. Vpon the 1. of Matth. his words, (if any to that purpoſe there at all) are but theſe: Diſcendum nobis eſt, ne priuati quicquam nobis in vita deligamus. Praecipuè autem ne calibatum arripiamus temerè, hoc eſt, ad iſtud viuendi genus non certo Dei iuſſu vocati, &c. That is, [We muſt learne to chooſe no priuate [vocation] to our ſelues in this life, and eſpecially that we doe not betake our ſelues to the ſtate of ſingle life raſhly, that is, not called thither by the certaine appointment of God.] Does Bucer ſay here, that we may not pray for continencie, or rather that we muſt not ruſh vpon it againſt Gods appointment and command? As the wiſe man ſaies, Wiſedom. 8. Deſirous to be continent (not onely as they that obſerue perpetuall maidenhead, but in any degree) I beſought God, and it was a piece of Wiſedome, that I knewe euen that, that I could not be continent, vnleſſe God gaue it me [by ſpeciall gift.] Which if Bucer had but ſaid, F. T. would haue cauilled him, for ſaying we might not pray to God for continence, though that be the very thing, which he profeſſes here he prayed for. And does not Bucer adde, Vt nihil priuati deligamus nobis? ſc. inuito Deo: We muſt chooſe no priuate courſe at all. By this reaſon then he forbids vs to pray to God for ſchollerſhip, for skill in muſicke, in nauigation, and the like; which who would collect, but ſuch a Huddibraſſe as this Adioynder?
               
               § 38. Now vpon Matth. 19. he repeats the ſame againe. Diligenter perpendendum quod Dominus ait, Non omnes dicti huius capaces ſunt, ſed quibus datum eſt. And after a fewe words between, thus: Non igitur noſtri arbitrij erit caelibes

[Where the Papiſts ſay, that by prayer euery man may obtaine the gift of ſingle life; they contradict Chriſt, who thus affirmeth, That all cannot receiue this ſaying.] And he ſhewes there are many things which we may well ſtriue for, and wiſh, and welcome if we haue obtained them; but not formally pray for them; as immunity from ſinne, the poſſeſſion of heauen before our time, &c.

What will they miſlike in this ſpeach of Bueers? Or does not the word all ſufficiently acquit him? Inſomuch as if I might defend Bucer, from one exception of theirs by endangering him in another, I would ſay that he encouraged vs to prayer but euen a little too much, and that pro externis, for outward things, among which it is apparent that he reckons virginitie (viz. as diuided from the eſſence of ſaluation:) yea, and laſtly, for others as well as for ones ſelfe. You ſhall heare his words vpon Matth. 8. a place which he referres vs to in his before quoted vpon Matth. 19. An antidote belike, that he fore

Si ad gloriam tuam facturum noueris, ſana me, pelle hoc aut illud malum, & nequaquam abſolutè, Libera, ſana, &c. Quòd ſi ſpiritus huc impellat, ac velut incogitantem rapiat, vt certâ fiduciâ exorandi quid externi vel tibi vel alijs ores, ſicut Apoſtoli multis alijs dona certa ſpiritus ſancti orarunt (maruell it is if Bucer would denie continencie to be one of theſe dona, at leaſt Medina ſo reckons of vs, de continent, ſacror, hominum, l. 4. controuerſ. 3. cap. 14.) indubiè exorabis quicquid id fuerit, quia fide orabis indubia. Credenti autem omnia poſſibilia, Marc. 9. 23. And againe a little after: Sic ſeſe habebit quaecunque ex Dei ſpiritu profecta fuerit pro re aliquâ externâ precatio, ne de orando quidem deliberabitur, nedum de exorando aliquid haeſitabitur, ſed ſpiritus certus, &c. Quacunque autem de re id exploratum non habuerit, abſolutè eam nullus petet, ſed adijciet, ſi ita Domino fuerit probatum, & ad ipſius gloriam momentum aliquod habuerit, &c. To me this doctrine ſeemes ſtranger then the other; I meane about the Spirits inſtigation of vs to prayer, then that which the Adioynder falſly imputes to him. If Bucer be no more amiſſe in his opinion of prayers infallibly ſpeeding vpon ſuch an inſtigation of the Spirit, then for certaine he forbiddeth not our praying for continency in this place, he is right euery way. And ſo much of him, and of the matter of Monkerie.
               
               § 39. THE next point is about the name Catholike: In which I might be ſhort, and ſhewe the invalidity of the argument that they vſe, to prooue themſelues Catholikes, becauſe they are called ſo, or rather becauſe they call themſelues ſo; as the Scripture ſaith of the name Chriſtian, (another kinde of name then the name Catholike) that not the Chriſtians called themſelues ſo, but were called, yea,

                  Irenaeus ſayes, that the heretikes, they oppoſe the name of Chriſt to ſuch as they are offended with, by way of prouocation onely, as it were to anger them, and to vexe them. Whereas the Papiſts, they practiſe the like ſubtiltie vpon ſuch as they haue to deale with, by mentioning or oppoſing to them not the name of Chriſt ſo much, (whome they are not ſo intereſſed in, euen by their owne confeſſion) as of the Church, the Church: as the fooliſh Iewes were wont to cry out of the materiall Temple, Templum Domini, Templum Domini, (but Ier. 7. 7. no regard to Dominus Templi) ſo theſe of the myſticall, and the name Catholike appertaining thereunto, by vſucapion forſooth, by plaine preſcription, as Campian dreameth.

Quod per exprobrationem dicitur. becauſe courtly paraſites flatter young ladies, with pleaſant words and honny titles, perſwading them that they are delicate, and ſoft, and tender, and not fit to tire themſelues with too much labour or paines-taking. But the principall partie that they are there intended to, is Babylon; or rather, as S. Hierome well obſerues vpon that place, not ſo much Babylon as Babylons daughter, daughter Babel, as the texe hath it, that is, young Babel. Which beſides the Papiſts, Rhem. in 1. Pet 5. 13. & alij paſſim. Comm. loci. catching at the word with all eagerneſſe elſwhere, to range their Peter within the gates of Rome, S. Hierome alſo himſelfe interpreteth to be Rome, and none rather then the Rome that now is; who as in many other points ſhe reſembleth the auncient Babylon not vnfitly, ſo herein moſt ſutable, that ſhe hath Ieſuites and paraſites in her, which call her Catholike, call her Apoſtolike, though ſhee be neuer ſo baſtard and degenerate. But what ſayes the Scripture before alleadged? Thou ſhalt no more bee called tender and delicate. Ecce tu cognominaris Iudaeus, ſaith S. Paul, Rom. 2. Thou art called a Iewe. And ſo we to the Papiſts, Ecce tu cognominaris Catholicus. But is he a Catholike that is called ſo? Or does not ſound faith rather, eſpecially if 2. Tim. 2. 19.

I haue ſaid nothing of the Cathari (a name neere to the Catholikes) yet voluntarily taken by ſome heretiques vpon themſelues, (as may appeare by the Canon of Conſtantinople laſt Caſſand.

On the other ſide, did not the heretickes miſcall the Catholikes, and ſtrippe them, as much as in them lay, of that glorious name? The Pelagians, ſaies S.

Macarians; the Manichees, called vs Phariſees; and diuers other hereſies diuerſly nicknamed vs. Lib. 1. poſter. contra Iulian Pelag. And was the Catholike cauſe euer a whit the worſe for that? No verily. For as Theodoret notes moſt excellently, lib. 3.

But as Eucherius ſayes of the honours and preferments of this world (in his Epiſtle Paraeneticall, ad Ʋalerian. fratrem) when they are croſſely and vnworthily (as often) beſtowed, that the thing which was inuented to diſtinguiſh deſert, is made to ſhrowd it & to confound it: ſo fares it in this Metaplaſme of names many times: Dignos & indignos non iam diſcernit dignitas, ſed confundit. And as he had ſaid before in the ſame booke, Alij nomen vſurpant, nos vitam. Where, the height of the title without ſubſtance anſwerable in the party owning it, is but as the light of a candle (as Marius ſaies in Saluſt) that diſcouers blemiſhes, but creates no beauty, in an ill fauoured viſage, preſented to it.

                     , Semper, & ab omnibus receptum: Whereas they now would confound Catholike and Romane, becauſe they haue much Romane which they cannot prooue Catholike. But we haue alſo further mention in the place aforeſaid, of the Throne of Satan, erected among the faithfull; a Metaphor belike taken from the Epiſcopall throne, as if Satan might get into that too, ver. 13. concerning Pergamus. And ver. 9. concerning the Church of Smyrna, hauing ſpoken of ſome that called themſelues Iewes, that is, true worſhippers of God, and are not (as was ſaid before) the holy Ghoſt oppoſeth 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , but the Synagogue of Satan. As who would ſay, They goe for Eccleſia, but are indeed Synagoga, and pretend Chriſt, but belong to Satan, which is the reproofe that wee charge our aduerſaries with, and I thinke not cauſeleſſe. Yea in the ſecond verſe of the ſame chapter (becauſe the Pope in all haſt would be Apoſtle or Apoſtolike, for hee claimes the tearme, and counts it his inheritance) you ſhall read that ſome ſaid they were Apoſtles, and were not, (whom the Church of Epheſus is commended for trying, afore ſhee would truſt, as S. Iohn alſo biddes vs to try the Spirits, 1. Ioh. 4. 1. and ſoone after he cenſures the prating Dietrephes,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . How fit was this to be premiſed before the

reſt of S. Iohns doctrine, throughout the whole myſticall booke of the Apocalyps, deſcribing Antichriſt ſuch as now he appeares? Laſtly ver. 23. of the ſaid chapter of the Reu. The Churches are to know, that it is God, which ſearcheth the hearts and the reynes, (as not caryed away with names or glorious titles) vnles it be nomen cum fide, the holding of his name with the not denying of his faith, ver. 13. of the ſame Chapter. Whereas the Papiſts leauing to be called by his name, (the name Chriſtians, which the Scripture onely recordeth) may well be ſuſpected to haue renounced his faith too, giuen him ouer cleane. For the holy Ghoſt wee ſee couples them both together.
               § 41. Yet the Adioynder is peremptory, num. 32. that the name Catholique cānot be vſurped by heretikes, but, is a moſt true and proper note of the true Church, and num. 33. that the name and the thing expreſſed by the name, doe alwaies ſo concurre, that they are neuer ſeparated. And againe, num. 34. that heretikes, or hereticall congregations, neuer did or could vſurpe the name Catholique, but the ſame hath alwayes beene and euer ſhall bee peculiar to the true Church, and that the name and the thing ſignified by the name, doe euer concurre. Thus he. But what ſuch priuiledge I wonder hath the name Catholique, ſupra omne nomen, aboue all names els, or why ſhould that only cleaue to truth, and the truth to it, whereas all other names may be diuorced from it? May the name Chriſtian be rent from the Church, by the furiouſnes of Iulian labouring to extinguiſh the whole body of Chriſtians, and yet Chriſtianity ſuffer no diſparagement thereby, as Theodoret witneſſed in moſt plentifull manner a little before, and cannot the name Catholique be borrowed of the Church, by the hand of ſome crafty intruder or other, but the Church ſhall no longer be her ſelfe? Yet the name Chriſtian implyes Chriſt in it, which is the head that we hold by, and the Prince of our Congregation. Secondly, Scripture recordeth it: and thirdly, it ſeemes giuen by diuine inſpiration, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ; Neither of which agrees to the name Catholique. No, nor yet

to the Gnoſtiques, a high name too, and from the abundance of knowledge, which they attributed to themſelues. Whom S. Paul is thought to twit, 1. Tim. 6. 12. giuing vs withall to vnderſtand, that there may be falſhood in names, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, the falſly called Gnoſtiques. Of Apoſtolike, Angelike, and if there bee any other, I might ſay the ſame. Why ſhould the name Catholique be more ſacred Vnleſſe they meane, that Catholique implies multitude, and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , as the ſcripture ſpeaks when it would expreſſe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Sic. lib. Iudith. But that is refuted elſewhere. then they, why leſſe expoſed to hereticall vſurpation? For Catholique and Apoſtolike, either draw in an equalitie, or at leaſt Apoſtolike is not inferiour to Catholique: Angelike one would thinke were aboue them both. And if the name Catholique ſtill goes where the true Church goes, how are the Catholiques themſelues not Catholiques, or not knowne by that name, as ſometimes it fared, witneſſe S. Auſten, but transformed into the titles of certain newfangled ſectaries, Suprà allegat. the Traducians, the Macarians, & the reſt of that rabble before rehearſed? Is it like that the heretikes wil not call thē
                  ſelues Catholiques, as the Adioynder pretends, whē they take from Catholiques the very name Catholike, and cloth them with other of their own deuiſing? Though S. Auſten moſt directly, contra Epiſtol. Fundamenti, cap. 4. (the booke that the Adioynder himſelfe here quotes) ſayes, that omnes haeretici ſe Catholicos dicivolunt, all heretikes would be called Catholiques, and Lactantius Inſtitution. lib. 4. cap. 30. that all heretikes ſuam eſſe potiſſimùm Catholicam putant Eccleſiam, they thinke themſelues Catholiques, and the Catholique Church theirs, in a prime degree. How then ſhall we beleeue that of Cyrill of Hieruſalem, (for wee will ſuppoſe it to be Cyrills for this once) which Bellarmine firſt alleadged, and the Adioynder here referres vs to, that no heretake will preſume to call his ſect Catholique, or to point to his own faction, if the queſtion be askt of the Catholique Church, as if that word were ſuch a ſcare to him? Does not this ſhew, that the Biſhop moſt aduiſedly anſwered to thoſe authorities, when hee anſwered in the words which the Adioynder carps here, that De nomine lis nulla inter nos intercedit, ſed vtripotiùs è re nomen habeant? We

ſtand not vpon the name (it hath beene ſhewed in the precedents, that there is no cauſe to ſtand vpon names,) but which of vs hath the moſt right to inherite the name, the glorious name (as S. Iames ſayes) quod inuocatur ſuper nos, by which we are called? As for S. Auſten, he might ſay, that 2. 7. 
                  tenet me poſtremò ipſum nomen Catholicae, reckoning the name Catholique among the laſt arguments, which perſwaded Note that S. Auſtens laſt is Bellarmines firſt. de not. Ecc. c. 4. him to continue in the vnity of the Church, and preferring like enough diuerſe forcibler before it, or els this would haue mooued him but little. Nay, when the Biſhop tells you that in caſe it were graunted, (for he doth but graunt it, wee beleeue it not) that it is true as you ſay, when ſearch is made after the Catholique Church, wee point to your Church; yet you cannot deny on the other ſide, but if the Catholique Reformed be asked after, a man will point to ours, and not thinke of yours for any ſuch mention: does not this abate your lofty ſwell, as much as the other ſond ſuppoſall ſerued to pricke you vp in pride? For Catholique reformed is a more tollerable addition, and more agreeable to all good rules of reaſon, and of faith, then Catholique Romane is at any

But as for the point in hand, whether the Romane faith, and the Catholique bee all one, becauſe Satyrus interpreted his meaning in that ſort, me thinks the Biſhop moſt compleatly anſwereth him, and ſo vntieth the knot that you would faine tie vs in, as he yet tieth you faſt enough in a farre tougher knot, at the ſame inſtant. Sciebat enim, &c. For hee knewe (ſaies the Biſhop) that the Biſhop of Rome was then a Catholique, a Catholique, protunc, and at that time punctually; but neither afore, nor after, very immediately. Will you heare what our Adioynders reply is to this? Hauing repeated the Biſhops words to the effect aforeſaid, he thus commenteth, Num. 29. So hee. Wherein he graunteth conſequently, that the Pope is ſupreame and vniuerſall Paſtor of the whole Church; for that muſt needes follow of his graunt, ſeeing it is euident, that he who then was Biſhop 
                  Muſt needs follow. 
                  of Rome, and whom he alloweth for Catholique, had, and exerciſed, a ſupreame and vniuerſall authoritie: To which purpoſe it is to be conſidered, who was Biſhop of Rome at that time: Whereto the Biſhop himſelfe giueth vs no ſmall light, ſignifying preſently after, that Liberius was Biſhop a little before him; and ſure it is, that Damaſus ſucceeded Liberius, and raigned many 
                  Damaſus raigneth. 
                  years, who therefore muſt needs be the Catholique Biſhop that the Biſhop meaneth. Perge porrò. Num. 30. Now then what authority Damaſus had, and exerciſed during his raigne, (I pray you, let it be obſerued here, the raigne of King Damaſus.

Now then what authoritie Damaſus had, &c. it appeareth, ſaith he, ſufficiently by that which I ſignified before, concerning him & his ſupremacie, in the fourth Chapter, where I ſhewed that the ſame was acknowledged, not onely in Affricke, by the Biſhops of three Affrican Synods, who in a common Epiſtle to him, gaue cleare and euident teſtimonie thereof, but alſo in the Eaſt Church, euen by the chiefe Patriarches thereof, to wit, by Peter the holy Biſhop of Alexandria, who immediately ſucceeded Athanaſius, and beeing expelled from his Church by the Arrians, fled to Pope Damaſus, and by the vertue and authority of his letters, was reſtored to his ſeat, as the Magdeburgians themſelues doe relate, out of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories. And in the Church of Antioch, his authoritie was acknowledged, by Paulinus the Biſhop thereof, receiuing inſtructions and orders from him for the abſolution of Vitalis the Heretike. Alſo afterwards, Theophilus Biſhop of Alexandria, and S. Chryſoſtome Biſhop of Conſtantinople, were ſuiers to him, to obtaine pardon for Flauianus Biſhop of Antioch, as may be ſeene more particularly in the fourth Chapter of this Adioynder, where I haue alſo ſet downe the cleare teſtimonies of ſome Fathers, who liued at the ſame time, and euidently acknowledged his ſupremacie.
               
               § 43. Numb. 31. So that the Biſhop graunting that Pope Damaſus was a Catholique Biſhop, and that the Church of

Rome was in ſuch integritie vnder him, that S. Ambroſe had reaſon to hold none for Catholiques, but ſuch as held vnion therewith, it muſt needs followe, that the ſupreame and vniuerſall authoritie, 
                  It muſt needs follow. 
                  which Pope Damaſus had, and vſed, was not vſurped, but due to him, and his Sea, and conſequently to his ſucceſſours. And whereas the Biſhop ſignifieth, that the Romane Church, and Biſhops, were not alwaies in the like integritie, that they were at that time, to wit, neither a little before in the time of Liberius, 
                  
                     Honorius and Liberius, not their raigue, but their time.
                   
                  nor ſhortly after in the time of Honorius, becauſe both of them ſubſcribed to Hereſie (as hee ſaith) I will not now ſtand to debate, &c.
               
               § 44. This is the Laconicall breuity of this Thom: To whome wee anſwer in a word (as for the repeating of his braue feates exployted in the fourth Chapter, we remit him to our anſwer thereunto in the precedents, touching euery particular;) That, if Damaſus had exerciſed ſuch an exoticall iuriſdiction, as he fondly dreameth, (and the allegations doe nothing prooue,) yet this could not preiudice his beeing Catholique, or he might be an vſurper notwithſtanding Satyrus his iudgement of him. Firſt, becauſe Satyrus meant onely in oppoſition to the Luciferian ſchiſmatikes, whoſe cauſe was not the cauſe of Eccleſiaſticall Supremacy. Secondly, Satyrus perhaps might not diſcerne the error, though the Pope had laboured of it, as diuerſe other good men alſo gaue way to it, vnwittingly. Thirdly, a Pope may be right in his beleefe, though he be erroneous in his practiſe, and ſo may any body els. For the theife himſelfe doth not thinke it lawfull to ſteale, nor the man-queller to murther, and yet they both commit the wickednes. Euen ſo the Pope may be Catholique, though he ſhould turne cutthroate, I meane Catholique for his faith, as the Papiſts take it, and ſpeculations only. Elſe we know, that S. Auſten requires more then faith, to make one Catholique, & giues bad liuers but a cenſerivolunt, they would be accounted Catholique, but are not. By which alſo wee may collect the Apoſtacie of the Church of Rome, her falling away from the faith

                  Catholique, by the contagion of euill manners that ſwarme in her, & non ſecundum Euangelium, 1. Tim. 1. 11. As Nilus his argument is out of the ſame chapter, ver. 19. that they that put away good conſcience from them, quickely alſo make ſhipwracke of their faith. Though the Adioynder holds, that the Church and her title cannot be ſeuered, but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , (which the Fathers ſo couple) the Papiſts thinke it no diſparagement to their Church, to haue them parted. Fourthly and laſtly, I ſay, Damaſus exerciſed no vniuerſall iuriſdiction, nor coueted after it, for ought the Adioynder hath demonſtrated. The leſſe Catholique therefore, See Anſw to his 4. chap. before. the more Catholique Pope Damaſus, whatſoeuer become of Liberius and Honorius, the one afore him, the other after him, not ſo currant both.
               § 45. There followeth preſently after (ſaith the Adioynder Num. 32.) a large and liberall grant of the Biſhop right worth the noting. In fine, what trow you? That the Biſhop ſaying, Fatemur omnia, nec de nomine lis, ſed utri è re nomen habcant, he by that confeſſeth, that they haue the true ſigne and note of the Church, and we not hauing it are heretikes or ſchiſmatikes. As if we forſooth refuſed the name Catholike, or the Biſhop implyed any ſuch thing in all his ſpeech, which not the deſperateſt wretches but cenſeri volunt, witnes S. Auſt. et ſi ſanari nolunt, 
                  lib. 20. contra Fauſt. c. 23. they would be called Catholiques. As Dioſcorus ſaid in the Councell of Chalcedon, Eijcior cum Patribus, Catholicis no doubt, I am caſt out with the Fathers (ſaith he) he meanes Catholique Fathers you may be ſure. And, Qui profitentur fidem Catholicam, ſaies S. Auſten, homil. 10. in Apocal. ſpeaking of Antichriſt and his leud company. Of whom alſo he addes, that, Imago eius (the Image of the beaſt) ſimulatio eorum eſt (is their counterfetting and hypocriſie) qui fingunt ſe eſſe quod non ſunt, &c. Loe, the marke of the Church, as the Adioynder counts it, is the Image of the beaſt, as S. Auſten conſtrues it, when it is falſly pretended, namely the name Catholique. Shall we not reſt then in the Biſhops moſt graue ponderation,

               § 46. IT followes in the Adioynder, Num. 35. And the like I may alſo ſay concerning his graūt in another matter, to wit, that our Biſhops are true Biſhops, and that the Proteſtant Biſhops of England had their Ordination from ours, yea from 
                  He that ſaies three, dent's not they were

                        ure, but ſhewes that he loues to ſpeake within compaſſe. 3. of ours (for ſo he giueth to vnderſtand) whereupon he alſo inferreth that he and his fellow Superintendents haue a true ordination and ſucceſſion from the Catholique Church, whereas the quite contrary followeth vpon his graunt. For if our Biſhops be true Biſhops (as hauing a true ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles,) and that the Proteſtant Biſhops haue no other lawfull ordination but from ours, two conſequents doe directly follow thereon; the ore, that we haue the true Church and doctrine, if the Biſhop his fellow and friend M. Barlow ſay true, who in his famous Sermon (mentioned by me elſewhere) affirmeth the ſucceſſiue propagation of Biſhops from the Apoſtles, to be the maine root of Chriſtian ſociety (according to S. Auguſtine) and the maine proofe of Chriſtian doctrine (according to Tertullian) as I haue ſhewed amply in my

Supplement; and prooued thereby, that M. Barlow and his fellowes are heretikes and ſchiſmatikes. The other conſequent is, that if the Engliſh Proteſtant Biſhops had no other lawfull ordination then from the Catholiques, they had none at all; for that at the change of Religion in Queene Elizabeths time, they were not ordained by any one Catholique Biſhop, and much leſſe by three (as the Biſhop ſaith they were) but by themſelues, and by the authority of the Parliament, as I haue alſo declared at large in my Supplement. Then, Num. 37. Wherupon I inferre two things; one that they haue no Clergie nor Church; for hauing no Biſhops they haue no Prieſts (becauſe none can make Prieſts but Biſhops) and hauing neither Biſhops nor Prieſts, they haue no Clergie, and conſequently no Church, as I haue ſhewed in my Supplement out of S. Hierome. The other is, that the Biſhop and his fellowes are neither true Biſhops, nor haue any ſucceſſion from the Catholique Church (as he ſaith they haue) nor yet any lawfull miſſion, or vocation; & that therefore they are not thoſe good ſhepheards which (as our Sauiour ſaith) enter into the fold by the doore, &c. 
                     Euthymius and Theophylact. vpon Ioh. 10. con ſtrue this doore to be the Scriptures. For by them (ſaith Theop
                           •
                        .) we are brought to God, as through a doore he is brought to ſpeak with a man, that hath an errand to him. To the ſame purpoſe Euthym adding, that Chriſt was the true ſhepheard, and entred by the doore, quia vtens Scripturis, & ſecundum eas gubernam. Whereas, the clamberer vp another way, who but the Pope?
               
               § 47. I anſwer in one word to his redoubled collections, & multiplied obſeruations, beginning with the firſt of his two inferences, & concluding with his ground from which he ſets out, as falſe as they, and more too. 
                  No Biſhops no Prieſts, ſaies he, becauſe only Biſhops can make Prieſts, & without both them, without all Clergy, & conſequently without a Church, as I haue ſhewed in my Supplement out of S. Hierome. For ſtill we muſt heare of the Supplement in any caſe, or els it is no bargain. But as for Hierome, we may oppoſe Tertulliā
                   to him, that, Quod quis accepit

                  & dare poteſt, whatſoeuer a man hath receiued, he may giue again (if occaſion be offred) in Eccleſiaſticall paſſages. And ſo our Sauiour ſets the Date, againſt the accepiſtis, inſtructing Matth 10. 8. his Apoſtles about the vſe of their gifts, which they had receiued of him.

Nemini citò manus impoſueris. And we know iuriſdiction is ſo reſtrained in Biſhops, by the Adioynders owne confeſſion, in diuerſe places of this booke; yea in Prieſts too, who are limited to their quarter for Adioynd c. 2. Num. 50. Euery Paſtor ought to haue, not only as much care of the whole Church, as euery other man, but alſo much more then others, by reaſon of his function and office, which doth extend it ſelfe to the whole Church, it beeing euident, that what authoritie ſoeuer any man hath in any part of the Church, it is giuen him for the good of the whole, and finally tendeth thereto. Againe. Numb. 52. Whoſoeuer is Paſtor in any one part of the Church, is capable of Paſtorall inriſdiction in any other, though he be reſtrained & limited to a certaine part, to avoid confuſion: in which reſpect the Prieſts in euery Dioceſſe are Prieſts throughout the whole Church, and may miniſter Sacraments any where in caſes of neceſſitie; and a Biſhop in any place is euerie where a Biſhop, and one of the Magiſtrates and Paſtors of the Church, and therefore hath a voice & right of ſuffrage in all Generall Councels, though they be held out of his Dioceſſe, &c. their ordinarie ſeruice, though their power conferred vpon them originally in their ordination, extend to euerie member of the Church. But I ſpeake what may be done in caſu, as I ſaid, and vpon an exigent only. Which if euer it was preſented, then for certaine when all was ſo out of frame in the Romane Church. Though I might quarrell him alſo for that, where he inferres againe thus; No Prieſts, no Church. Their Rhem. Teſt Annot. in Luc. 22. v. 19. & Mat. 26. ver. 20. 
                  Rhemiſts note, that our Sauiour Chriſt made not the Apoſtles Prieſts till his laſt Supper. And yet, I hope, Chriſt and his companie were a Church before that time, and a Church of the new Teſtament; or elſe more incongruities will follow, I beleeue, then the Adioynder will ſalue vp in haſt. S. Paul calls Philemons houſe a Church. Yet himſelfe was a lay man, as the Fathers hold; which perhaps would not haue been, but that Ambnin locum, & alij qui cum ſequuntur. a Church figuratiue may be without a Miniſter. Why not then a true? I would but fiſh their iudgements, I am to ſift ſome things for diſputation ſake. For though Archippus 
                  Com. in Epiſt. ad Gal. cap. 1. was a Miniſter, and Philemons ſonne, (as ſome thinke) yet their houſes were diſtinct, as appeares by S. Hieromes Commentarie vpon this place. Ambiguum eſt, vtrum Eccleſiam quae in domo Archippi ſit, an eam quae in domo Philemonis ſignificare velit Apoſtolus, cum dicit ſe ſcribere Eccleſiae quae
                  
in domo eius eſt: ſed mihi videtur non ad Archippi, ſed ad Philemonis referendum eſſe perſonam, &c. Yea Haymo ſaies directly, Com. in Epiſt. ad Gal. cap. 1. asking why S. Paul ſalutes no Biſhops, Prieſts, or other Clergy-men, writing to the Galatians, as he does whē he writes to other Churches, Quia nondum habebant ne

                      facilius ſedici potuerunt. And yet Galatia a Church; or many Churches in Galatia; as it is, cap. 1. v. 2. But ſo much may ſuffice to his firſt collection.
               § 48.  Now to his ſecond. That the Biſhop himſelfe and other his colleagues here of the Church of England, are neither true Biſhops, nor of any ſucceſſion, miſſion, or vocation, viz. becauſe they enter not in by the doore, that is, are not ordained by Popiſh Biſhops, in whom alone the ſtreame of ſucceſſion runs along, as he ſurmiſeth; though to this laſt I ſhall ſpeak more diſtinctly by and by: Yet in the meane while to anſwer to his wiſe illation, iuxta prudentiam hominis, as Salomon biddes vs: Pope Nicholas their firſt was of another minde, as it may ſeeme at leaſt, by his anſwer ad Conſulta Bulgarorū, c. 14. where, when the people of that place would haue had a certaine Grecian to haue loſt his eares, to haue his noſe ſlit, and other ſuch diſgraces, for preaching Chriſt, though to the benefit of the people, yet without any lawfull ordination; the Pope diſſents from them, and qualifies the matter by theſe words of the Apoſtle; Siue occaſione, ſiue QVOCVNQVE Philip. 1. 18. MODO Chriſtus praedicetur, non laboro: yea hee concludes thus, euen of the generall queſtion, out of another Popes mouth his predeceſſor, (a Pope you ſee quoting his predeceſſor Pope, and the Apoſtle S. Paul too:) Non quaerite quis vel qualis praedicet, ſed quem praedicet: It is no matter, who, nor what kind of man it is that preacheth, but whom hee preacheth, viz. whether hee preach Chriſt or no. Which laſt words are as ſtrange to me, as contrarie to the Adioynder in this place. And ſo perhaps is that peruerting of the Apoſtles ſentence before cited. For when wee ſay, Non intereſt quis praedicet, vel qualis; we are not to meane it

of morall idoneity, or morall ſufficiencie, but of Eccleſiaſticall, as the Schoole teaches. So is the Pope to the Adioynder, and the Schoole to the Pope, and hard but the truth to them all, contrarie. In the 16. chapter of the ſaid Reſponſa, it ſeemes the people had executed their wrath vpon that poore caityfe that had fained himſelfe Prieſt, and cropt his eares, and done him the deſpight which afore they trauailed with, but queſtioned whether they might doe it lawfully or no. Belike the Popes anſwer had not come to their hands, or elſe paſſion was deafe to milder aduiſe. Whereupon in reproouing their hard vſage of him, hee proceeds thus, to excuſe the matter: Si Dauid eſſe ſe furioſum finxit, vt ſuam tantum ſalutem operari poſſet, quam noxam contraxit, qui tot hominum multitudinem QV OQV O MODO de poteſtate Diaboli & aternae perditionis abſtraxit? In Engliſh thus, [If Dauid fained himſelfe mad, onely to ſaue his life; what fault was he in, that pluckt ſo many men out of the power of the deuill, and from eternall perdition, IT IS NO MATTER HOVV?] Is this good diuinitie? Or may you plead ſo, and not wee?
               
               § 49. As for that which he produceth out of Biſhop Barlowes Sermon to fortifie this point yet a little better againſt vs, it is meerely ridiculous; becauſe when Biſhop Barlowe ſpeaks of the ſucceſſion of Biſhops to be the root of Chriſtian fellowſhip, and the proofe of Chriſtian doctrine, he meanes as Irenaeus takes ſucceſſion, cum chariſmate veritatis, with the gift Iren. l 4. c. 43.

               § 50.  But to come at laſt to the third point, which is the ground and bottome of the other twaine, and ſo an ende of  this matter, and in the next of the whole, if God ſay Amen. You ſay, Our Biſhops in the beginning of the raigne of Queene Elizabeth, ordained themſelues by mutuall compact, beeing deſtitute of other helpe from Welſh and Iriſh, which in vaine they ſollicited. And you produce your author, Others reckon of a Grecian Biſhop vſed in this conſecration, Eudoem. Parall. p. 243. But ſo doe lyers agree betweene themſelues. Doth not this alſo encreaſe the credit of our Regiſter: For that is conſtant, while the impugners of it are at variance. one Homo nihili. 
                  Thomas Neale, a worthy wight, no doubt, though no more be ſaid in conmendation of him. Yet you adde, that he was Reader of the Hebrew Lecture in Oxford afterward; it may well be. And thus you haue approoued (as you thinke at leaſt) that our men were not conſecrated by lawfull Biſhops and lawfully called, I meane ordained of them that your ſelues call Catholiques. From whence what flowes? That Clergy wee haue none, nor Church none, and the Biſhop is no Biſhop againſt whom you write, &c. But theſe two inferences we haue diſcuſſed before: how well they follow out of the premiſſes, though they were graunted. As for the Biſhop in particular, that reuerend Prelate, the obiect of your enuy, and the ſubiect of our controuerſie, I might ſay much, and yet conuince in ſhort; that the defect of oyle, cannot hinder his 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as the Philoſopher ſaid wittily, that it was not poſſible that Laert. 
                  Hercules ſhould be debarred heauen, becauſe he was not initiate; ſo, that the Biſhop ſhould be no Biſhop for lacke of Ordainers. But the greater his worth, the more my ſilence; and his ſcorne of theſe reproaches, à magnitudine animi, non

à ſuperbia, as Tully ſaics of Socrates,) bridles me, euen dumbe. The ſumme is; that when we ſay, our Biſhops were ordained by yours, we meane by ſuch as were firſt ordained by your Biſhops, though not perſiſting in their Relligion happily. They were yours by Primitiue ordination, not yours by conſtance of profeſſion. And this was enough to make good their act. For the power by them receiued through impoſition of hands, makes them fit ordainers, not the ſtedfaſtneſſe of their faith, or keeping cloſe to the doctrine: or elſe euery faithfull man might be a lawfull ordainer, which you are loath to grant to euery faithfull Prieſt, and much more to Lay-men. It were not hard to ſhewe who conſecrated the firſt Biſhop in Queen Elizabeths time, which was Archbiſhop Parker. Biſhop Barlow (I trow) was one, firſt Biſhop of Bath and Wells, then of Chicheſter, who was made both Prieſt and Biſhop in the time of King Henry the 8. And therefore you may be ſure, by men of your Relligion, and by Popiſh Biſhops. Biſhop Scory Biſhop of Chicheſter firſt, and after of Hereford, was another, who was made Prieſt in King Henries time, and Biſhop in King Edwards. Biſhop Hodgkin Suffragan of Bedford, made Biſhop in Queene Maries time. Miles Couerdale Biſhop in King Edwards time, &c. So as neither did our Biſhops conſecrate themſelues, by compact or playing booty, as you malitiouſly ſlaunder them, and the other Biſhops that were vſed in their conſecration, were partly made Prieſts, partly Biſhops, in former Princes raignes, & thoſe Popiſh, but all before the raigne of Queene Elizabeth. I might adde much more here, as I haue read it taken out of the originall Archiues of the Church of Canterbury, about the iudgment of 6. Doctors of the Ciuill Law, who all ſubſcribed, that the Commiſſion for their conſecration graunted by the Queenes Maieſty to the perſons abouenamed, was iuſtifiable N

                     , why might not this ods haue beene ſilenced? And yet the abſence of two doth not invalidate the buſines, ſith the Commiſſion is content with any foure. and lawfull: viz. William Maye, Robert Weſton, Edward

Leeds, Henry Haruey, Thomas Yale, Nicholas Bullingham. I thinke, your Neale himſelfe, if he had been of the profeſſion, and not reading his Ebria, or addicted to lyes, rather then to the lawes, would not haue diſſented from the opinion of ſo many ſages. Marry, if you meane of Biſhop Cranmer; his conſecration is more pregnant yet, and confirmed by ſundry Buls of Pope Clement the ſeuenth, as if need were might be ſpecified at large. The firſt whereof was to King Henry the 8. two other to the elect himſelfe Thomas Cant. the fourth to all the brethren and ſuffragans of the Church of Canterbury: the fifth to the Clergy of the Citie and Dioceſſe of Canterbury. And ſo diuers more which here I omit for breuitie ſake. He was conſecrated, 1533. ann. Reg. Henrici 8. 24. March. 30. by Iohn Biſhop of Lincoln, and Iohn Biſhop of Exceter, and Henry Biſhop of Aſaph. The ſame day alſo, accepit pallium. Yea he paid the Pope 900. duckets in gold for his Bulls. But as far as I perceiue, you cauil not the conſecration of Archbiſhop Cranmer, but onely them that were made in Queene Elizabeths dayes, viz. Archbiſhop Parker, and the reſt. And the reaſon to me ſeemes to be this, becauſe the Pope had a fleece out of the ones conſecration, & none out of the others, nor neuer ſince. Certamen mouiſtis

               § 51. This which I haue aſſirmed of the conſecration of theſe two Archbiſhops, not onely Mr. Maſon, of his exact knowledge, will iuſtifie to your head, or any of you all, notwithſtanding your braue Appendix at the ende of your Adioynder (then which I neuer ſaw a more filly plea) but almoſt any nouice in the Church of England. And if my leaſure would permit, or that were now my taske, how eaſily might I detect the ſundry abſurdities that your Appendix containeth? Firſt, Num. 4. you alleadge a ſtatute of Ann. 1. Eliz. cap. 1. and Dr. Stapleton vrging it againſt Biſhop Horne, That no Biſhop ſhould be held for a Biſhophere in England, without due conſecration before had, &c. Yet you argue in the

ſame place, but more importunately ſoone after, Num. 9. that both Stapleton and Harding would neuer haue preſſed Biſhop Iewel, and the reſt, with want of due conſecration, if this Regiſter had been true, or any ſuch thing to haue beene ſhewed in thoſe times. But if Stapleton and Harding bee ſo authenticall with you, that whatſoeuer they once vrge vs with, is ſtraight vnanſwerable, then I confeſſe we are in a wofull caſe. And yet to ſay ſomewhat in defence of them too, without graunting your ſlaunder of our firſt Biſhops in the Queenes time, what if the miſlike that they had to thoſe conſecrations, was becauſe they were not conſecrated by Popiſh Biſhops, (for Proteſtant Biſhops is of your putting in into Mr. Hardings words, num. 11.) and not ſuch as were ordained by the Popiſh? Are you not aſhamed to confound theſe things ſo groſſely, and vtterly to miſtake the ſtate of the queſtion? If Harding and Stapleton therefore were ſo conſiderate men, that a falſe imputation could not proceed from them, their meaning was this, What Biſhop conſecrated you, that is, what Popiſh Biſhop or Catholique Biſhop in your ſenſe? But if they meant that they ruſht in, either without any conſecration, or baſely agreed to conſecrate one another (a deuiſe meeter for boy-Biſhops, ſuch as Popery aboundeth with, then for godly and graue Prelates of the Church of England) they were doubtleſſe inconſiderate; and if neuer before this time, or neuer in any any other matter, (which is more then the fame that goes of them) yet for this one part iuſtly to be ſo cenſured. Vnleſſe their abſence from their country, and not conſulting of the Regiſter, might plead their pardon; in tanto, I graunt, not in toto; but howſoeuer it be, this is a ſtrange argument of yours to confront a Regiſter with, the life of things paſt, the image of truth, the memory of times, the light of memory, that Harding and Stapleton would neuer haue been ſo bold, as to contradict it, if it had beene ſo. Nay then, why ſhould Queene Elizabeth prouide by Statute (as your ſelfe here tell vs) and her graue Counſellors deuiſe vnder her (which Counſellours you may bee

ſure neither wanted foreſight, and were moſt faithfull to her in all her proceedings,) That no

                      Counterblaſt againſt Biſhop Horne, fol. 301. And therefore you are indeed no true Biſhops, neither by the Law of the Church, neither yet by the Lawer of the Realme, for want of due conſecration, expreſſely required by an act of Parliament renewed in this Queenes dayes, in Suffiagan Biſhops, much more in you. 
                  Biſhops ſhould goe for Biſhops here in the Church of England, which wanted due conſecration, if ſhe meant ſhortly after to ſet vp and authorize, a generation of Pſeudo-Biſhops in the ſame Church, her ſelfe? Had not this been to kill the very life of her intents, and to alienate the people from embracing the Relligion, that ſhe was minded to promote with all her power? For this Act of Parliament you ſay was, Ann. 1. of Q Elizabeth. But both the Arch-biſhop, & the other Biſhops, were not conſecrated, till about the beginning of the ſecond yeare of the Queenes raigne. Biſhop Parker in December, Biſhop Iewel in Ianuary, &c. Now then let me aske you (a ratte trackt to death, by the apparant euidence & impreſſion Who is the ſcorpion now that carries the remedy againſt his own poiſon about him? The Adioynders ſweet compatiſon, cap. 10. num. 70. of your owne marks: for I aſſure you, but for your owne text here, I had neuer conſidered of this ſtatute of Queene Elizabeth) let me aske you, I ſay, Is this good Logicke? Harding and Stapleton (though prickt with paſſion, and enuying other folkes good fortunes) would neuer haue accuſed Biſhop Iewell their aduerſary, if the caſe had not been cleere; And is not this much more forcible, Queene Elizabeth, and her ſage Counſellors would not haue forbid that thing by act of Parliament, which ſhortly after ſhe meant to licence, and to put in practiſe, in the open view of the whole world? But what ſhould I ſtand arguing with ſuch a beaſtly iangler, that calls Biſhop Iewells anſwer to Hardings queſtion, concerning his conſecration, ambiguous and irreſolute, &c. (Numb. 10. of his Appendix) becauſe he ſaies, OVR Biſhops are made as they haue been euer: Not, VVE were made, or I was made? Does he not ſhew that there was no difference between his making and others, when hee ſaies, they were made as they haue been EVER, and ſo defend himſelfe, as withall to defend all, becauſe the quarrell was not his (bleſſed man that he was) but the whole Churches of

England, which he maintained as zealouſly, as any champion would his owne? Neuertheles you tell vs againe, Num. 11. (as if you could neuer ſay it enough, becauſe indeed you haue nothing els to ſay) That it is not to be imagined, D. Harding would be ſo inconſiderate, as to demand expreſſely of M. Iewell, what three Biſhops in the Realme laid hands vpon him, if there were fowre, as M. Maſons Regiſter hath it? Send ouer your Page then, or your Squire at armes, or if you will your Desk-creeper, as it is Num. 13. to peruſe and ſearch the Regiſter of the Office, which M. Maſon auoucheth. You ſhall finde Biſhop Iewell was conſecrated by theſe fowre, Matthew Archbiſhop of Canterbury, Edmund London, Richard Ely, Iohn Bedford; and the conſequents and the antecedents (which you are ſo doubty iealous of in your Num. 14.) will prooue M. Maſons Regiſter, to be a true Regiſter, not diſprooue it. Though I doubt not but theſe things are known to many, before M. Maſons booke ſaw light. And I confeſſe for mine owne part, I had my inſtructions long ſince, ex alio capite; albeit I derogate nothing from his worthy paines.
               § 52. I See I muſt end as I began. The Supremacie of Princes, and namely of His Maieſtie, is the thing that the Adioynder moſt maligneth. That is their firſt, that their laſt, if they be well lookt into. I am well content with it for my part,

No maruell if hee giue his aſſaults there (meaning ill to his Maieſtie,) where he knowes a great part of the ſtrength lyes (like that Worthyes in his locks) which he endeauours to purloin and divert another way.
               § 54. The recriminations are diuerſe, which I will anſwer briefly, ſetting them downe in their order, and ſo conclude. For there is no moment in any of them; but hungry malice ſets the pen on worke, which were better quiet, if it knew his owne good:
I fuge, ſed poteras tutior eſſe latens.

Tim. 6. 2; he fetches it from Chriſt. Yet the Adioynder thinks that we are free to all things, if they be not of faith; that we may chooſe whether we will conforme to them or no, though the morality that they imply, be neuer ſo ghoſtly. What then ſaies he of not ſtealing, of not committing adultery, of doing no murther, and diuerſe ſuch like? For Idolatry, I thinke, they acknowledge none, it is ſo promiſcuous in Popery. Are not theſe things morum, and not fidei? Themſelues ſo diſtinguiſh them, at other times. Bellarmine by name, de Port. Rom. lib. 4. cap. 5. Decreta fidei, and Praecepta morum, are two with him.

               § 56. Neuertheleſſe the Adioynder turnes merry with vs; and ſaies if it be ſo, it may well come into our Pater noſter, but neuer into our Creed, this doctrine of the Supremacie. As if firſt there were nothing betweene the Creed and the Pater noſter, that if it lodge not in the one, it muſt needs be thrown off to the other. How if it pitch vpon Moſes his Law (as I ſaid euen-now) either the iudiciall, or the morall, part thereof? Did not the Adioynder complaine very lately himſelfe, that the Biſhop was to blame for deriuing it from thence? As See cap. 1. who would ſay, It appeares there indeed, & there is no denying; but the Biſhop was not to take the aduantage of that place; of none, I trow, but onely the Creed. Elſe, this is not a matter of bare ſpeculation, or naked apprehenſion, as the points of faith may ſeeme to be; but ends in action, and in obſeruation. The more likely therefore to come of the Law. And is Moſes Ordinances of no force with him, in good earneſt? Or is not that of validitie, that deſcends of the Law? Of the Law, I ſay, whereof one iot or tittle is not to fall to ground (as he ſaid trueſt, that kept it beſt, and in

the point of ſubiection, aboue all other:) no, though heauen Matth. 5. 18. Luk. 16. 17. and earth ſhould paſſe away, and the whole frame of nature be diſſolued. But in truth it reſults out of euery part of the Catechiſme, as I ſhall briefly ſhew, occaſioned by the Adioynder, 
                  The Supreame authoritie of Princes reſults out of euery part of the Catachiſme 1 and his iolly deſcant here, that would make it a point not of our Creed any longer, but onely of our Pater noſter. And firſt out of the Creed, (I meane onely conſequentially, but ſure effectually enough) both in Natus de Maria, and Paſſus ſub Pontio, as hath been ſhewed heretofore, and may quickly be conuinced againe. See pag. 94. huius, in marg. and againe, pag. 481. It was Chriſts firſt and laſt theame that euer he eſtabliſhed, and much alſo in the middle of his gyant race, (as the Pſalmiſt calls it, Pſal. 19.) yet not like a gyant, be 
                        •
                     lando cum dijs, that is, cum Regibus. For he neuer declaimed againſt King in his preachings; though no doubt, it would haue been paſſing popular with the Iewes; but refuſed the Kingdome when it was offered him, paid tribute to Caeſar for Peter and himſelfe, exhorted others to doe the like of duty; Reddite Caeſari, not Date; and not veſtra, or gratuita; but qua Caeſaris ſunt. So in many other things he allowed the heathen Princes to dominari eorum, to lord it among their ſubiects (onely he ſet a barre in his Apoſtles way, Vos autem non ſic:) he allowed them that wait vpon Princes, to goe in mollibus, in ſoft cloathing; he called his Church by the name of a Kingdome, himſelfe often by the name of a King, implying his Supremacie; which he would neuer haue done, but that he was moſt loyally and reuerently affected to regiments, and a great fauourer of the Royall eſtate. But this was in the middle of his courſe, as I ſaid. Of life and death, beginning and ending, we ſhall ſee anon. In the meane while, to conclude out of the Creed againſt him, and to enforce the argument laſt propoſed; I demand of the nimbleſt Ieſuit of them all: Forſomuch as the Creed recordeth the ſuffering of our Sauiour Chriſt, vnder Pontius Pilate (an infidell Magiſtrate) and by his authority; whether it was wel and wiſely done of Chriſt, to yeeld

Who firſt had whole legions of Angels to reſcue him; who ouerthrewe them that came to take him

with a ſingle word, with Egoſum; and laſtly promiſeth in plaine tearmes of himſelfe, that he layes down his life in whoſe hands he pleaſes (he made choiſe of an infidell:) and no body takes it away from him perforce. But of this enough; let them looke to their anſwer. In the life of Campian, ſet out by a Ieſuite, (one Robert Turner as I take it) we read, that he deſired to haue the Creed rehearſed by the people at his death. But why ſo I wonder? For what article of the Creed did Campian die, when they would charge vs moſt? Where is Rome in the Creed, where Peter, where the Pope, where any of thoſe things about which they iangle now, and keepe a ſtirre? Rather as we read in another place of the ſame booke, that their Prieſts beeing ſuddenly diſcouered in a bay-mow, and eft-ſoones to be ſurprized, they confeſſed At one Yates his, in Warwick ſhire.

May not we rather fetch Supremacie from hence (which thoſe wretches in extremitie could not but acknowledge, that we are not to prouide for the ſafetie of the Church, vijs & modis, as they traiterouſly reach, and vpon that ground diſclaime the authority of infidels, but to cōmit our cauſe to him, that iudges iuſtly, &c.) Does not the point, I ſay, in hand about the Princes Supremacie, ſpring a great deale clearer from theſe words; eſpecially beeing exemplified by our Sauiours practiſe, and explained, as of late, by S. Peters commentarie, (that we Vide & S. Cyprian ex eodem capite praeclarè argumentantem in eandem ſententiam, tum in Tract contra Demetrian pag 27

That ſo we may fetch it not onely out of the Creed, which you ſee how well we may,

without croſſing the Biſhop, and yet wringing the Adioynder when he thinks hee is ſafeſt, but out of the Pater noſter too, which is the ſecond part of Catechiſme, wherein now we are.  As for the Commaundements and the Law of Moſes,  to them I haue ſpoken ſufficiently already, and the Adioynder denies it not. Alſo he ſeemes to graunt it of the Paternoſter, though we ſhould not euict it, as we haue.  The Sacraments  onely remaine, which are the fourth part of Catechiſme: ſhall we ſee how this truth appeares from them too, that the ſcoffing Adioynder may bee concluded euery way for all his deſcants?  Firſt then, as we are not baptized into  the name of the Apoſtles, Paul or Cephas, 1. Cor. 1. 13. nor any of their ſucceſſors, but into the name of Chriſt, and the obedience of the doctrine which he brought, Math. 28. 20. which we haue ſhewed already how fauourable it was to Princes; and therefore Baptiſme ſpeakes for their ſupremacy, not for the Popes: So in the other Sacrament, which

                   is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in which we are to preach the Lords death vntill he come, 1. Cor. 11. 26. we haue a farre clearer glaſſe of the aforeſaid aſſertion; for ſo much as his death was nothing but his ſubmiſſion to the Ciuill Magiſtrate, who vniuſtly perſecuted him to the very death. Which Saint Paul thinks worth the noting, when he faſhions his ſcholler Timothy, leaſt he ſhould turne aſide to faction, and to Ieſuiticall garboyles, 1. Tim. 6. 13. Or elſe what needed S. Paul to name Pilate in that place? But it is reaſon that the Supremacy ſhould be confirmed from euery place. Yet our Sauiours obedience ended not in death, no not the death of the croſſe, mortem autem, Phil. 2. but there is a ſtep after death, wherein alſo it was moſt eminent. In that Ioſeph of Arimaethea begd his body of the Magiſtrate, (by his inſpiration no doubt) and aduentured not to vſurpe vpon it, no not for the vſe of buriall when he was dead, without leaue. See we what a ſubiect we haue of our Sauiour? what a proclaimer of the Supremacie belonging to Princes? Both in wombe and tombe, both an embryo and

a corps; both afore birth, and after death; and ſtraight afore Streight after birth, he fled from Herod conſpiring his deſtruction, not reſiſted, but fled; which was another token of his ſubmiſſion. And immediately afore death, he acknowledged Pilates power to be giuen him from heauen, Ioh. 19. All the parts, all the acts of our Sauiours life and death, were full of this practiſe; full of Reuerence to Princes: whom the Ieſuites vnder. value; yea, vndermine when they can. death, and ſtraight after birth; an early beginner, and a moſt conſtant perſeuerer, euen ſomewhat beyond the tearm prefixed; for vſque ad mortem, was wont to be the laſt, Reuel. 2. 10. if any man can goe further, let him.

Marry Sir, if the Supremacy be not a matter of faith, (and yet we haue ſeen how neer of kin to the Creed, though nothing is truer then the Biſhops ſaying, that it is not an article, nor de fide, properly) but what then does the Adioynder infer, thinke you? Firſt, that we may not ſweare to it; then that it is not to be gathered out of Scripture, neither expreſſely, nor by conſequence; alſo that we may chooſe whether wee will beleeue it or no: and a great many more ſuch idle collections, for want of Adioynd.

How many oaths are taken in Courts daily, both aſſertory and promiſſory; yea and without the Courts too, that are no way ſo much as bordering vpon the Articles of faith, and much leſſe of the ranke of them properly ſo called? Inſomuch as this one place, if there were none other in the booke, is of force to ſhew the toyiſhneſſe of our Adioynder; or elſe his ſottiſhneſſe, or for certaine his egregious impudence and boldneſſe, that dares abuſe his Readers in ſuch vile ſort, as to perſwade them that they may not ſweare to the Kings Supremacy; becauſe the Biſhop ſaid it is no article of faith. Does not the Biſhop ſay, it is a point of perſwaſion (though it be ſhort of faith,) and that not waueting, but firme, & ſtedfaſt, and vndoubted? Therefore alſo he prooues it by places of Scripture; though we may ſwear

to many things which are not euident by the Scriptures, and we ſweare ſo daily. Shall I not ſweare that King Iames is lawfull King in his Dominions, and alſo Supreame to all perſons of the ſame, as it followes in the oathes both of Supremacie, and of Allegeance, vnleſſe I read it in the Creed, or elſe in Scriptures?

As for that he addes moreouer, that if it bee not of faith, the Scriptures no where containe it, neither expreſſely, nor by implication, &c. what more rude and more vnlearned, iuſt like all the reſt? Would the Biſhop be ſo contradictory, doth he thinke, to himſelfe, (from whome I hope they will not derogate the praiſe of ſo much iudgement as to heede his owne methodes, though moſt maliciouſly they depraue him otherwiſe at pleaſure,) as to alleadge diuerſe Scriptures for the Kings Supremacy (and yet not impertinently, as he here crakes, and ſaies he hath anſwered them, but moſt ſoundly and moſt ſeaſonably, as we before haue ſhewed) and then conclude it is no point of faith properly ſo 
                  See Chap. 1. frō Sect., 6. &c. 
                  called, but of perſwaſion onely (yet moſt grounded perſwaſion) if he had not well perceiued the vnrepugnancie of theſe two, and how compatible they are betweene themſelues, which the Adioynder cannot skill of? But ſo I haue heard of an old plodder in Logicke, that to his dying day could neuer conceiue, how the accident of blacknes might be ſeparated from a Crow, ſo much as in cogitation: and another that was as hardly brought to digeſt, that euery thing either is, or is not. So here the Adioynder, as if his wits were be-breecht; If it be not of faith (ſaies he) then it is not in Scripture; neither directly, nor yet implicitely. Belike not Pauls cloake, or Peters ſcabberd, Converte gladium in vaginam. For it may be they will ſay it is de fide that he had a ſword. But the truth is, that Peters ſword had a ſcabberd. Whereas S. Paul talkes of the Kings ſword as alway naked, neuer couchant. Rom. 13. &c. both reuealed in Scripture, and yet neither of thē of faith. And to defcēd a little lower to their other kinds of Scriptures, Tobyes dogge, I ween, or rather his dogs tayle, which Tob. 6. 11.
                  
the Text ſaies he wagged, and Campian your Martyr made ſuch mirth with in the Tower, proouing thence the verie point which you now deny, that all is not de fide which is comprehended in Scripture. But he petulantly and profanely enough, as his guiſe was; yet with you a graue diſputant in matters of religion, or a mortified man drawing on to martyrdome. For though nothing be of faith which is not reuealed in Scripture, (as we hold, though you deny;) yet there are many things in Scripture which are not of faith, as neither we deny, and your ſelues hold, at leaſt when you are not captious, as now it ſeemes you are, to croſſe your ſelfe, rather then you will not carpe another. I ſay, ſome things are not de fide, which are contained in Scripture; not but that we muſt beleeue all to be moſt true which the holy Scripture containeth: but ſome things are ſo without the circuit of our faith, as it is no preiudice to vs, though we take no notice of them; as Pauls cloake perhaps, as Peters net and ſword-ſheath; or if you will, as Tobies dogge, and the like: others moſt neceſſary and moſt wholeſome to be receiued, as our dutie to Superiours, our deportment to Ethnicks, and them that are without, our diſcreet and laudable conuerſation towards all, which the Creed is no rule of (that narrow verge) though the Scripture in her latitude, thinke no ſcorne to be. It See Rom. 12. Eph. 5. item 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . Coloſſ. Tit. Timoth. ſtuft with ſuch like theoremes, ſanae doctrinae, but yet not fidei. So is ſolutio decimarum, ſo penſitatio tributi, and diuers more. S. Paul himſelfe enforcing Supremacie by this laſt, Rom. 13. yet not as of faith, but of godly moralitie. For the Infidels did it as wel as the Chriſtians.
                   remaines therefore, that the Biſhoppe might argue for the Supremacy either from Moſes Law, or Moſes his practiſe; though it bee not 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   only, not a matter of faith, but of firme perſwaſion; which yet is more then Bellarmines Pie credimus.
               
               § 59. Neuertheleſſe to infringe the Biſhops argument, To the Adioynd. Numb. 41. you ſay, Moſes did not lay aſide his Prieſthood, but Aaron and he remained Prieſts together. So as from thence we can draw no proofe for the Temporalties preheminence aboue the Clergy, in what degree ſoeuer Moſes ſtood to Aaron. But who euer heard of two high Prieſts together? viz. Moſes and

                  Aaron, both at one time? Or how could they both be the High Prieſts, that is, each of them ſupreame to all Prieſts? What greater corruption was in thoſe declining times, when Anna

But when couetouſneſſe and ambition preuailed moſt, and drew them moſt aſide into degeneration, what greater deflexion, I ſay, could there be then this, from the originall inſtitution? Yea, how could the Prieſthood of our Sauiour Chriſt be typically ſhaddowed and prefigured by two, whereas he is our one and onely High Prieſt, without copartner? How the Popes ſole-regencie be deduced from thence, as Bellarmine would, and diuerſe more? Vnleſſe they meane to admit multitudes into the chaire; and then where is Monarchy? Sure, Theodoret in Numer. Quaeſt. 23. calls Aaron the 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  , the roote and fountaine of Prieſt and Prieſthood; which how could he be, if Moſes were equally participating with him in that preferment, and the Prieſtly of spring of ſucceeding ages, to deriue their pettigree as well from the one as from the other? Where is the vnitie now that the Papiſts ſo hunt after? Where the reducing of all particular propagations, & ſpreadings Eccleſiaſticall (as they ſpeak) to one originall and primitiue head?

So as Caietan in his expoſition of Pſal. 100. ſayes onely thus, Aaron fuit ſummus Sacerdos, & Moſes fons ſacerdotij inuenitur, dum ipſe conſecrauit Aaron. Where we may note three things. Firſt, that he does not giue the name of ſummus ſacerdos, the [ſtanding] high Prieſt, to Moſes at all, but to Aaron only. Secondly, that Moſes was fons ſacerdotij. Yet not to croſſe with Theodoret, who ſaid a little before, that Aaron was the 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ; but rather that we may hold Eccleſiaſticall

Iuriſdictions to be deriued after a ſort from the temporall Prince; of which hereafter. For it ſhould ſeeme he eſteems Moſes here as a temporall gouernour, hauing giuen away the name of high Prieſt to Aaron. Thirdly and laſtly, he makes Moſes prieſthood to be reſigned againe, and laid downe, in that he vſes the word dum, Dum conſecrauit Aaron; which the Adioynder ſaies, is to make it like a ierkin, or a iacket, Numb. 41. this is his merriment; but wee proceede.

Auſtens words are, Caepiſſe ab Aaron videatur ſummum ſacerdotium, the high-prieſthood may ſeem to haue begun in Aaron. Therefore if Moſes be high Prieſt in ordinary, he is Aarons juniour, and ſo ſubiect to him. Yet the Adioynder would haue Aaron to bee vnder Moſes, as High Prieſt, I trow, vnder the higher High Prieſt. Once, there is no difficulty in my opinion, neither in S. Auſtens words, nor at all in the queſtion about Moſes prieſthood, if wee will be ruled by S. Auſten. Quid putamus (ſaies S. Auſten) fuiſſe Moyſen? ſi non fuit ſacerdos, quomodo per illum omnia illa gerebantur? ſi autem fuit, quomodo ſummum ſacerdotium ab eius fratre coepiſſe definimus? So that you ſee it is definimus with him, not onely videatur. S. Auſten hath laid it downe for a ſure ground, that the high-prieſthood began in Aaron. And as for Moſes his prieſthood, it is a matter of queſtion with him, Fuit, an non fuit? was he a Prieſt or no? As for that which followes; Ambo ergò tunc ſummi ſacerdotes erant, Moſes & Aaron,. i. Both of them were high Prieſts, both Moſes and Aaron; I haue anſwered it before, that they were both Cohenim, that is, both excellent, but in a diſtinct kind; the word ſacerdos agreeing to them both, but not vniuocally. Concerning the next clauſe (which the Adioynder vaunts in) Aaron vero ſub illo, Aaron was vnder Moſes, it makes for vs,

who hold the High Prieſt to be ſubiect to the authority of the Temporall Magiſtrate; S. Auſten guiding vs as it were by the hand, to that opinion, in the words immediately following, Aaron quidem ſummus [fortè] propter veſtem Pontificalem,

That is, Or was not Aaron the higher for the garment that he wore [that is, by way of Prieſthood,] but Moſes his better in regard of a more excellent function that he diſcharged? correſpondent no doubt to the Regall with vs. For he is called a King without any more circumſtance, Deut. 33. 5.

                   And indeed what higher calling after the Prieſthood then that? The Kingdome then to S. Auſten is excellentius miniſterium, if we compare it with the Prieſthood. So as neither Moſes was Prieſt, and yet ſuperiour to the High-prieſt, by the doctrine of S. Auſten; which is the doctrine of our Church, concerning Supremacie.

But if he meane by the internall gouernement of the Church, the adminiſtring of Sacraments, the preaching of the word, the inflicting of cenſures, &c. herein I graunt the Miniſter is ſole conuerſant, the Prince meddles not with the execution; but what derogation is this to the Supremacie, or who euer of our Diuines went farther then ſo, in this point?

Vnles you thinke that Peter may rule them like beaſts, becauſe of Paſce oues meas, the Kings gouernement beeing more ciuill and humane, becauſe Erunt Reges nutritij tui, (for you cauill the Biſhop here, for praeſidium bumanum, as well as externum:) Which ſhould prouoke our men, me thinkes, to embrace the Kings gouernment rather then the Popes, if they be men indeed; ſith the one profeſſes violence and boriſhneſſe of himſelfe, the others milde proceedings are acknowledged by his aduerſarie. Though againe we might ſay, that our Sauiour neuer meant ſo vilely, or ſo baſely, as to ſet his Prelates ouer vs, like keepers ouer beaſts, whom he would not haue to gouerne, as common Princes doe their ſubiects, Vo

                      autem non ſie, but rather more gently. And yet if any liſt to ſtraine the metaphor to theſe rigors; perhaps Nutri (when we haue done all) is as much as Paſce, and enforces as abſolute a gouernment as that: a child at thoſe yeares not much differing from a beaſt, nay verily ſhort of it; both for want of iudgement, and ſo eaſie to be ouer-ruled; and out of lacke of force, or bodily ſtrength, to defend aſſaults, and ſo as eaſily curbed and ſubdued.
               § 68. Laſtly, I dare affirme, that if the Adioynders malice had but laine that way, he would as ſoone haue cauilled the Biſhop for amplifying, as now he does for depreſſing beyond due, the Supremacie of Kings, by the conſequence of thoſe words. Hee makes but a pupill, nay a perpetuall babe
                  
(would he haue ſaid) of the Church. And, He will haue Kings to take vpon them, like gouernours or foſter-fathers, ouer a yong child in the cradle. Though we haue ſhewed before, that for ſo much as ſome read, Erunt Reges dispenſatores tui, in that place of Eſay, the Diſpenſator though he were no King, is of ſingular authoritie ouer the pupill whoſoeuer, though happily he be of the Royall breed, (as Auſonius boaſts in a certaine Epigramme, that the Princely imps were ſubiect to his ſeruler) the Apoſtle teſtifying as much, Gal. 4. 1. 2. that the heire himſelfe differs not from a ſeruant (though he bee Lord of all,) whiles he is in his nonage; but is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   (that is, vnder diſpenſators (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , vntill the time appointed by his father.) This is that which S. Chryſoſtome ſayes, in 13. ad Rom. (and yet not meaning to mocke) that the Prieſt hath a primacy indeed, but in altero ſaeculo, in the other world; if the See S. Chryſoſt. his words at the ende of this Chap. Pope could be content to tarry for it ſo long. But howſoeuer that be, I hope the Nurſe her ſelfe may waken the child as well as lull it aſteepe; chide it and ſneb it, as well as giue it the dugge; yea correct and chaſtize it, as well as dandle and hugge it; which is all that we ſtriue for in this queſtion, that the Prince may cenſure the offending Church-man, and reduce him into order; a thing that F. T. cannot abide to heare of, and yet complaines that the Biſhop minceth the Supremacie. Whereas Supremacy without this cannot ſtand for certaine, nor yet Defence of the Church, which he allowes to Kings, Numb. 48. but this graunted, they are both ſafe, as much as we deſire.

T. their leaders; ſeaſoning their lyonets with ſuch morſels euen betimes, and ſwearing their Anniballs, ſcarce twelue yeares old, at the Altars, to diſturbe their

countries peace in time. Beſides, the Papiſts conteſt againſt the gracious gouernement of the KINGS MAIESTIE that now is, and exclaime vpon the Supremacie that he now challengeth; which we alſo defend. What is that to the times of King Henry the eight? or what are King Henries times to vs?
               § 70. And yet to anſwer him a little more ſtrictly, in ipſis terminis: It was ordained (ſaies he) ann. 26. Hen. 8. c. 1. in theſe words. Bee it enacted, &c. that the King our Soueraigne Lord, his heires, and Succeſſors, Kings of this Realme, ſhall bee taken, accepted, and reputed, the onely Supreame Head of the Church of England, called Anglicana Eccleſia, and ſhall haue and enioy annexed and vnited to the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme, as well the title and ſtyle thereof, as all Honiars, Dignities, Preheminencies, Iuriſdictions, Priuiledges, Authorities, Immunities, Profits, and Commodities to the ſaid Dignitie of Supreame Head of the ſame Church belonging. Thus farre belike the Statute. And what from hence gathereth Mr. Adioynder? I will ſet downe his words. So ſaith the Statute (quoth hee) which muſt needes bee vnderſtood to giue ſpirituall authority, when it giueth all that power, Dignity, and Iuriſdiction, which belongeth to the Head of the Church, &c. Much for ſooth. This ſpirituall Iuriſdiction haunts them terribly, you ſee, euerie where ſcares them. But why ſo good now? For ſeeing that the Church is a ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall body, it muſt needs be gouerned by a ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall power, reſiding in the Head thereof, &c. Obſerue his elegancies: Eccleſia eſt corpus Eccleſiaſticum, The Church is a Church-bodie firſt. Is not this delicate? But then againe, The ſame Church is abodie, and yet a ſpirituall bodie, to Mr. Adioynder, in his moſt curious deſcriptions. And yet, I hope, not like S. Paule ſpirituall body, after the Reſurrection, 1. Cor. 15. which is called ſpirituall, becauſe it is plyable and obedient to the motions of the Spirit, (as we are taught by S. Auſten in his Enthiridion) but as it ſhall pleaſe his wiſedome at more leiſure to interpret. In the meane while, if the Church becauſe it is a ſpirituall body
                  
(as he ſpeaks at leaſt) muſt therefore haue no Head, but one that is endued with like ſpirituall authoritie, conſider the conſequents, and marke what a confuſion they would bring vpon life, while they wilfully peruert our meaning in the queſtion. For how many are heads and principalls to others, which yet partake not of the faculty that they deale in? And good reaſon. For the perſons of men liuing and conuerſing in ſuch or ſuch a Commonwealth, are ſubiect to the gouernour thereof, and he the Head of them; without any reference to their particular trades or profeſſions that they follow.  Elſe how ſhall a woman be Queene ouer ſouldiers (as  the Papiſts will not deny but in temporalibus ſhee is) and yet no ſouldier, nor fit to beare armes?  How is a King the  Head of Philoſophers, liuing within his Dominions, whether Platonickes, or Peripatetickes, or whome you will, though he be neither Maſter nor Diſciple of their ſect, no way ingraffed into their ſocietie?  How is the Pope himſelfe head of hereticall and Apoſtaticall Prieſts, and yet not  combined with them in their hereſie or Apoſtaſie? How of the Iewes in his Dominions, of whome he is Head, at leaſt as Temporall Prince, as you conceiue?  Are there not diuers  Superintendents of whole Vniuerſities, and Scholaſticall congregations throughout the world, which neuer were trained in the ſchollerſhip or learning of thoſe places? And yet they may proceede againſt the Diuines that are therein, in matters of Chriſtianitie; as for omitting of Sermons, of Theologicall Diſputations, alſo falſe doctrine in them, &c. though they themſelues be no Prieſts, and the others are.  Yea, why may not KINGS beare authoritie  ouer Prieſts, and Spirituall perſons, though themſelues be none, as well as there be diuers Rectors and Gouernours of particular Colledges throughout the Realme (and that alſo perhaps according to the auncient Statutes) who beeing no Prieſts, nor Spirituall men themſelues, haue authoritie neuertheles ouer the whole companie, and among the reſt ouer the Prieſts too? So as firſt, the King by vertue of

his place, may exerciſe power ouer them that are Spirituall or Prieſtly perſons, though himſelfe Patres 6. Synodi, Epiſt. ad Iuſtinian. Imp.

And practiſing this, Almightie God will reward him accordingly; if otherwiſe, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , let him thank himſelfe, as the Canons ſpeake. For God will not hold him guiltleſſe in iudgement, though the impatience of men may not wreake their quarrell. The Adioynder 
                  Numb. 47. 48. & 49. ſaies, the Catholikes (meaning the Papiſts) will not deny this, but that they affirme and teach that Kings are for the nouriſhment and defence of the Church, as much as either the Prophet Eſay, or the Biſhop of Ely himſelfe, &c. Which if it be ſo, I ſee not but the queſtion, (euen by that which hath been ſaid) may be alreadie at an ende.

It is further yet enacted (ſaies he) by our Parlaments, that King Henry the eight, might not only viſit all Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and reforme all kind of errors, hereſies, and abuſes, in the Church of England; but alſo aſſigne 32. perſons to examine all manner of Canons, Conſtitutions, and Ordinances, Prouinciall and Synodicall. And further, to ſet in order

and eſtabliſh all ſuch Laws Eccleſiaſticall, as ſhould be thought by him and them conuenient to be vſed and ſet forth within his Realmes and Dominions, in all ſpirituall Courts and Conuentions, and that ſuch Lawes and Ordinances Eccleſiaſticall as ſhould be deuiſed and made by the Kings Maieſtie, and theſe 32. perſons, and declared by his Maieſties Proclamation vnder his great Seale, ſhould be onely taken, reputed, and vſed, as the Kings Laws Eccleſiaſticall, &c.

Furthermore, King Henrie made the Lord Cromwell his Ʋicar generall for the exerciſe of his Spirituall and Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction, by vertue whereof the ſaid Lord Cromwell ordained Eccleſiaſticall Lawes and Iniunctions, and publiſhed them vnder the Seale of his Vicariate, directing them to all Archbiſhops, Abbots, and the reſt of the Clergie. And albeit Queene Elizabeth did not vſe in her ſtyle, &c. Thus he. A fable of the Adioynd. that Q. Eliz. refuſed the title of Head, and retained of Governreſſe As if they are not all one. Neither was Governreſſe the title that ſhe delighted in. In the Records of the Kings Coll. in Cambr. I finde Q Marie ſtyled Head of the Church, &c. So farre was Q. Eliz from reiecting it.

Or how does this ſhew that King Henry the eight aſſumed vnto himſelfe any Eccleſiaſticall authoritie, or Iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall, which is the ſumme of the Queſtion betweene you and vs?

I wiſſe, better then your Beſſes, or Abbeſſes in their Cloyſters, to whom you haue made ouer the ſpirituall iuriſdiction now in ordinarie. And Baldus ſaies, the like may be done by the Pope to any Layman whatſoeuer, as I haue quoted before out of the Catholique Diuine in his Anſwer to the Reports of my L. Cooke.

                  Knights that wear the ſpurre, as the Regiſter of the Templats, and Order of S. Iohn of Hieruſalem: quoted by M. IV Cambden in his Britannia, Cornavijs.
                   
                  Templars of Balſhall (a commanderie of theirs in Warwickſhire) gaue to Roger Mowbray (a temporall Knight, but their bountifull benefactor) power of pardoning whomſoeuer of the brotherhood (belike ſpirituall men and all) in caſe they had offended againſt the Statutes of that Order. Whereas pardoning of faults, (which are, if any thing, de fore interno) is more then giuing He that hath licence for doing, incurres no fault at all: but the breach euē of humane laws (vndiſpenſed) is a ſinne in conſcience; by the Papiſts doctrin. Lycenſes or Faculties ad extra, either for eating of fleſh, or marrying out of ſeaſon, or neglecting reſidence, or if there be any ſuch like. But we ground not the Supremacie vpon the Acts of Parlament, which belongs to the Prince by more originall right: It is enough for vs, that you can

neither foile it by them; and that you are foyled there, where not withſtanding you thinke to foyle vs moſt.
               § 78. You againe deny, with like boldneſſe as before, Adioynd. Num. 54. & 55. 2. Sam. 15. 17. that Saul was head of the tribe of Leui, though the text ſay plainely, he was caput tribuum Iſrael, head of the tribes of Iſrael; vnleſſe Leui be no tribe. But, Non omnes Iſrael qui ex Iſrael, with you perhaps, Rom. 9. 6. All are not Iſrael that are of Iſrael. Not as with the Apoſtle, according to the myſterie of diuine election, but according to your abſurd conceit of exemption; as if Saul had had no power ouer the tribe of Leui, whom you heard Ezechias coniuring ſo lately, and commanding them, and ſetting them about their worke. Is not all Iſrael giuen to Salomon, 1. King. 11. 38? Yet your reaſon for exemption is, becauſe the Leuites were giuen to Aaron. By the ſame reaſon therefore they are exempt from Aaron, and onely ſubiect henceforth to Salomon. As for the title of Headſhip, what can be more pregnant then Eſay, 9. 15. that the prime in honour beeing the head (which is the King without all queſtion, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) the Leuite is ſo Rom. 13. Tit. 3. & 1. Pet. 2. farre from the Supremacy, which you talke of, yea or from immunitie either and exemption, that the falſe Prophet (the vnworthy Clergie-man) is made to bee the tayle, by Gods owne expoſition of thoſe termes in that place. In this ſenſe therfore Caluin would not haue abhorred the name of Head to be attributed to Kings; (as the Biſhop moſt truely and moſt directly anſwereth you) no not in Eccleſiaſticall matters themſelues; of whoſe iudgement in that point I ſhall ſpeake ſoon after, God willing, and auouch his credit (with many more of them, whom you maliciouſly call Puritanes) confuting your lies and flaunders againſt him.
               § 79. Adioynd. vbi priùs. For as for 
                     Sauls guard refuſe to doe a wicked act at their maſters commaundement: yet the Guard was not exempt from Sauls authoritie: neither will the Adioynder haue it ſo. This diſobedience therefore prooues not but Saul was King as well ouer the Prieſts as others. 
                  Sauls commandement to ſlay Abimelech the High-prieſt, wherein his ſubiects refuſed to obey his wil; It was becauſe the commandement was cruell and vngodly, in which caſe we muſt rather obey God then man, and ſpare the liues of innocent

perſons, though we hazard our owne; as the Matrones Exod. 1. did the young brats of the Iſraelites, not fearing (ſaies the Text) 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Hebr. 11. and for that their name remaines vpon euerlaſting record. But whereas Doeg did that which the others would not doe, I meane, ſlay Abimelech, whom S. Auſten (you ſay) calls the repreſenter of the earthly Kingdome and ſocietie of wicked men, Com. in Pſal. 51;  I hope, firſt you ſee by this, what Repreſenting  meanes in S. Auſtens language, of which I haue debated with you in the firſt Chapter more at large; not authoritie, but myſterie; not ſtanding for the Soueraigne, but for the ſemblant onely.  To omit that in the ſame place he ſaies alſo  of Dauid, Dauid figurauit non Regis ſolum perſonam, fed Sacerdotis: Dauid bore the perſon not onely of the King, 
                  
                     Dauid repreſents the Prieſthood, not onely the Kingdome. 
                  but alſo of the Prieſt, becauſe hee eate of the ſhewe-bread, which was lawfull onely for the Priests to eat of. This may make for ſpirituall iuriſdiction in Kings then, if you look not better to it. 
                  Finally, you muſt not thinke that S. Auſten here means by Imperium terrenum, the gouernment of Kings ſimply in it  ſelfe, as if no Ciuil Magiſtrat might puniſh a Prieſt (though neuer ſo high) if he be a malefactour, but (as your ſelfe expound it, in the words of your text, by Societas impiorum, that is, the wicked of the world; S. Austen alſo ſaying there, One Doeg & many Doegs.
                   
                  
                     Ʋnus homo eſt Doeg, ſed & genus hominum eſt Doeg) of degenerating Tyrannies, where baſe flatterers lend their hand to vnmanly butcheries vpon euery hope of Quid mihi dabis, and good men are promiſcuouſly maſſacred and made away. Wherefore S. Auſten ſaies more particularly in the ſame place, that 
                     Doeg a figure of Iudas.
                   
                  Doeg ſignified Iudas the betrayer of our Lord, who was a ſpirituall man, not a temporall, as you know. And yet the original of Chriſts death proceeded from him, not from Kings, nor from Ciuill Magiſtrates, which is worth your noting. Though accompliſhed it could not be without Pilates faint concurrence, and the rather that our Sauiour might ſhew his ſubiection to ſuch a ſilly one, onely for authorities ſake. In this ſenſe the ſame Father, Com. in

Pſal. 1. makes earthly Kingdomes to be Cathedra peſtilentiae, the chaire of Peſtilence, (though afterward he accommodate it to Falſe Teachers rather, that is, to Churchmen.) Not that Ciuill princedome is ſo in it owne nature, (as Mr. Sanders would gladly haue it, de Clave Dauid, lib. 1. cap. 2. Quòd ſaecularis potest as non potiſſimum in laudando & praemijs afficiendo,

It is called the Chaire of Peſtilence (ſaies he,) becauſe the pestilence is a diſeaſe that rages generally, and ſweepes away whole multitudes with it, where it comes. And ſo this is a vice that euery bodie is ſicke of, deſire of preheminence, ambition, and vaine glorie, (Regis

Auſten is of the ſame minde that Seneca ſeemes to be of, lib. 2. de Benef. cap. 20. Quòd optimus civitatis ſtatus ſit ſub rege iuſto, and that Brutus was to blame for beeing wearie of Monarchies (who was iuſtly therfore frighted with the apparition of a Dio & aliſ. blacke dogge for his abhominable aſſaſinate.) Yea S. Austen himſelfe acknowledges as much in plaine tearmes, lib. 20. contra Fauſt. cap. 14. Ibi

                  regna foelicia eſſe vbi omnium pleno conſenſu regibus obeditur; That Kingdomes are there happie, where all men obey the King with full conſent.
               
               § 80. To your miſtaking of our Act of Parlament in your Num. 57. as if that gaue more power of cenſure to Kings, thē the Reuerend Biſhop in his graueſt ponderation of theſe matters alloweth, and ſo the King might excommunicate, ſuſpend, &c. I anſwer as before, (for you doe but goe ouer the ſame thing again as if we had neuer heard of it, though nothing be more triuiall:) Excommunications are not coactions, 
                  Gerſon, &c. (ſauing onely as they are inflicted contra voluntatem perſonae;) And the Parlament giues power onely coactiue to the

King; though true it is, that without his countenance, their very Spirituall proceedings cannot well take place, in a wanton age, and a contemning nation. And if the Kings of our Land may excommunicate by Parlament, why neuer doe they ſo? Why doe they let that ſword to ruſt for lacke of vſe? If they may adminiſter any Spirituall Iuriſdiction whatſoeuer (as you thinke they may by Act of Parlament) why doe they neuer practiſe ſome ſpecialties of it, at one time or another? neuer preach, neuer baptize, neuer conſecrate Biſhops, &c? For you cannot ſay it is for lacke of leiſure; for leiſure they haue as little to many Temporall buſineſſes, in their world of employments. And ſome time at leaſt would be ſet apart for theſe, if it were but to keep their title in vre. As for skill and ſufficiencie, you will neither diſparage I hope the times paſt, ſo much, but that skill there was enough to indite a Cenſure, (though who knows not how many that might be borrowed of?) and for the fulneſſe of perfection in all manner of faculties that are incident to the wit of man, but eſpecially of the Booke which is deliuered him vpon his Throne, you may remember who gouernes at this day. But no doubt, Praxis & Conſuetudo eſt optima legū interpres, & they practiſe none of this, no not in all their life time; It is a ſigne therefore they challenge none by vertue of their Lawes, though Parſons, and Saunders, and the Adioynder cry out neuer ſo loud, that they doe, for want of better matter, to ſtuffe their pages, and to abuſe their Auditours.
               § 81. THE laſt point of all is about the Biſhops defending Adioynd. Num. 62. of thoſe whome we call Puritanes, againſt the ſcandalous imputation that Bellarmine chargeth them with, of diſſenting from the Supremacie. Whereunto I haue ſpoken once before. What can be more godly thē the Biſhops practiſe, to defend all that may be defended, euen in the aduerſaries themſelues, euen in them that gather with vs but in 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . halfe, to cheriſh if need be the dimme light, and the drooping

candle, and the ſmoking flaxe, after the example of our Sauiour? As we read of Atticus Archbiſhop of Conſtantinople, that he excuſed Nouatus, and praiſed Aſclepiades an old Biſhop of the Nouatians, not for loue of the ſect, I thinke, but either to gaine the parties, or as not turning from the truth, though with aduantage to his aduerſaries, Socrat. l. 7. c. 25. But this part is handled ſomewhat crookedly by the Adioynder, with cringings and wrenchings, now for the Puritanes, then againſt thē, but all to bring preiudice to the good Biſhop & the Truth. Howbeit, nothing is more eaſie, then the Anſwer to all. The Puritanes (ſaies he) defend as good a Supremacy as the Biſhop. What then? It may be, that was the very ground of the Biſhops aſſertion, that the Reformed Churches maintaine the ſame opinion about the Supremacie, all of them, that we doe. What ſhame then can ariſe to the Biſhop from hence? Is it not matter of praiſe and felicitie rather, that we are all of vs of one mind, in auouching the right that belongs to Kings, and oppugning the Papiſts the oppoſers thereof? But let vs heare his reaſon: 
                     Quoniam percepimus Eccleſiae & relligionis noſtrae tranquillitatens, &c. Iuram. Scot. Edit. an. 1581. quoted by the Adioynder. Though this be ſomewhat auncient to prooue the iudgement of theſe times by, eſpecially for one that takes notice of the Biſhops iuſt exception, Dies diem docuit, &c. See Adioynd. Num. 68. 
                  For they alſo ſay (ſaies he) that the King is to gouern and preſerue the Church, in externis, &c. And haue we not ſhewed before, that as no bodie can reach to the interna properly, by his immediat action, not the Prieſt himſelfe, but only the holy Spirit of God, ſo the Vide Chryſoſt. in fine huius. Quanquam loquitur it à & Synodus ſexta Conſtantinop. in Epiſt. Concilij ad Iuſtinian. Imper.

               § 82. Neither is that ſo ſmall a matter as the Adioynder would make of it, where he ſaies the Biſhop ioynes with the Puritanes, that allow the King 
                     No more power then Defenſiue, & yet Sanders ſaies the Sword is Avenger rather. But theſe two numina, Praemium, & Poena, conteine the Church, and conſummate the Suprematie. 
                  no more power ouer the

Church, then onely to maintaine it, and to defend it. For whatſoeuer the Puritanes opinion be of this matter, which they may abridge in conceit, after they haue enlarged in ſtyle, no bodie diſcouering them, (at leaſt I am not he that can diue into their ſecrets) the word Defender and Maintainer of the Church, will ſtretch to as much Supremacie as either his Maieſtie now aſſumeth, or we avow; & more by much then the Papiſts will graunt him: yea it is that which they oppoſe with might and maine, that reſults from theſe very words of Defence and Maintenance. For how can a King defend the Church, maintaine the vnity, preſerue the beauty, vnleſſe he haue power to reforme both ſpirituall faults, (let me call them ſo for this once). I meane Though S. Auſten make hereſies vicia carnis, as the Apoſtle alſo doth, Gal. 5. By how much more they ſhall belong to the Kings correction hereſies, blaſphemies, ſchiſmes, & the like, and that in ſpirituall perſons too, euen in the loftieſt of the crew, who ſting their nurſe as dāgerouſly as another, nay farre more dangerouſly many times, both by their ſcandalous liuing, & eſpecially by their broaching of pernicious doctrins,

Might this conceit ſtand, it were ſomewhat that the Adioynder replyes to our argument; but it is ſo ſtale and ſo groſſe, that the little boyes here laugh at it, though old gray-bearded Papiſts, and the Adioynder for one, are not aſhamed to reiterate it.
               § 83. But will you heare an elegancie, a queint deuiſe? In his Numb. 63. Though the Puritanes are defectiue in their opinion of Supremacie, yet both they and the Papiſts are better

Thus does he ruminate and re-ruminate his cud againe, and goe ouer his abolita at

                  e De Merit. & remiſſ. pecc. initio lib. ſpeaks. But for the Puritanes of Scotland, whom he quotes in his margent, I finde no ſuch thing in the words alleadged by him, that they hold the Supremacie to bee a matter of faith, (Papa poteſt condere novū Symbolum, & novos articulos, &c. Triumph. Ancon. p. 310. the Papiſts Creed I know is not yet perfected, and they may take in what they liſt.) Nay, I thinke, it neuer came into their minds (good men) to trouble their braines with ſuch a nice ſpeculation, whether the caſe of Supremacie be de fide or no; but howſoeuer it be, I haue anſwered it before, that our perſwaſion thereof is

               § 84. Yea, But what the Puritanes teach concerning this 
                  
                     Adioynd. Num. 63. 
                  point, you haue heard in the laſt Chapter by the teſtimonie of Mr. Rogers, approoued and warranted by all the Clergie of England, to wit, 
                  The Adioynder addes further here (out of Beza as it ſeemes) that Kings cannot be exempted from the diuine domination of the Preſbyterie, &c. Forſooth, nor from Confeſſion vnder a ſhauen Prieſt, with the Papiſts But who knows not that we haue baniſhed the Presbyterie here in England, or rather neuer receiued it, not onely in extention (as it reflects vpon Kings,) but not ſo much as in ſingle eſſence? And yet in France (which was Bezaes owne countrey) Rex cauſam dixit aliquando in iudicio, ſi vera Bodinus. Was hee not therfore ſupreame? So here perhaps. 
                  that Princes muſt be ſeruants to the Church, ſubiect to the Church, ſubmit their ſcepters to the Church, and throwe downe their crownes before the Church, &c. Whereupon I gather (ſaith the Adioynder) two things; The one, that the Supremacie

which (as the Biſhop ſaith) the Puritanes doe acknowledge in the King, is to be vnderſtood onely in temporall matters: The other, that all reformed churches are alſo of the fame mind, ſeeing that they profeſſe the ſame doctrine concerning the Kings Eccleſiaſticall Supremacie that the Puritanes doe, as the Biſhop himſelfe confeſſeth, &c.
               
               § 85. Then Numb. 66. (for I would gladly take in all:) Beſides that albeit we ſhould graunt that the Puritanes and Reformed Churches doe allow the Teporall Magiſtrate to haue ſome power and authoritie in Eccleſiaſticall matters, yet it is euident that they doe not allow them that ſpirituall iuriſdiction and authoritie, which our Parlaments haue granted to our Kings, that they may giue diſpenſations, licenſes, make Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, giue commiſſions to conſecrate Biſhops, to excommunicate, ſuſpend, cenſure, viſit, and correct all Eccleſiaſticall perſons, Reforme hereſies and abuſes, &c. and with this the beaſt breathes out his laſt, or almoſt his laſt. To whome I anſwer in order, and as briefly as the nature of ſuch obiections will permit; Princes may ſerue the Church and ſubmit their ſcepters, ſubiect their Crownes before the Church, (though all ſupreame Magiſtrates doe not weare Crownes, that I may tell him that by the way, and we now by Prince vnderſtand all) yea, and 
                  Of the licking the duſt of the Churches feet, ſee S. Hierome before, pag. 519. It imports ſmall ſubiection; ſuperioritie rather. And yet here the Church doth not ſignifie the Clergie; yea as ſome thinke, it is no where ſo taken at all in Scripture. Laſtly (if it were) yee the word Church is not once named by the Prophet Eſay, but he directs his ſpeech to them that are of the Church; the beleeuers in generall. 
                  licke the duſt of the Churches feete, as the Prophet Eſay ſpeakes, and yet retaine their Supremacie firme and inuiolable. How ſo? Marry it is a ſhame for the Adioynder not to ſee it of himſelf, without a guide, remembring who calls himſelfe the ſeruant of ſeruants, and yet pleades for a Lordſhip limitleſſe ouer the Church, (at leaſt the Adioynder will agniſe him for his good Maſter, though he goe for a Seruant) but neuertheleſſe we will helpe him.

Doe I ſpeake riddles? or are others of the ſame minde? Dominotur ſacerdotibus Imperator (ſaies S. Gregorie, l. 4. Regiſt. ep. 15.) ita tamen vt etiam debitam reuerentiam impendat: [Let the Emperour, on Gods name, beare ſway ouer Prieſts, but ſo that he reuerence them as meet is.] And he addes withall, Atque hoc excellenti conſideratione faciat: [And let him ſo doe vpon excellent conſideration.] But though the examples be obuious, (for euen Ioſeph was a father to Pharaoh 
                  Gen. 41. 43. his King, that is, reuerenced by him, or much eſteemed by him, and neuertheles comprehended vnder Pharaohs grand authoritie, as a Subiect in the Commonwealth) yet the Adioynder hath no place left for this conſideration, as excellent as it is in S. Gregories iudgement.

But ſecondly, if the Puritanes admit Lay-presbyters  to inflict excommunications, and ſuch like cenſures, is it likely that they will exclude the Kings highneſſe altogether from ſpirituall gouernement, when they take in ſuch meane men of the lay, and not rather acknowledge his excellent prerogatiue?

                   would exaggerate, not ſo much as baptized, (that by the way I may tell you Sir, to your Numb. 68. & 69. in defence of Biſhop Barlow, whom there you bite at, and ſaue my labour of anſwering more particularly, as at firſt I had intended, to thoſe your diſcourſings: That Princes not baptized, nay nor ſo much as godly minded (which Conſtantine then was, whether baptized or no, when Mr. Saunders takes the exception to him for want of baptiſme) haue the ſame ſupreame right to gouern the Church that Chriſtian Kings and profeſſing the faith haue, though by error and tranſportation they either neglect it and periſh it, or perhaps euill employ it, to the afflicting of her whom they ought to haue aduanced and promoted moſt.) As for their beeing beads, that are no members (which is another thing that troubles you) though I haue anſwered it before, and you haue ueuer done with it, yet briefly thus once againe; Why not ſo, I pray you, as well as a King the head of that companie of his Commonwealth, which either profeſſes ſome art that he cannot skill of (ſuppoſe Surgeons, Marriners, Muſitians, and the like) or practiſeth the wickedneſſe

that hee abhorreth from his ſoule, (ſuppoſe Atheiſts, Heretiques, Drunkards, and Adulterers.) For firſt, he is no member neither of theſe damned ſocieties laſt named; nor of thoſe before, which he is a meere ſtranger to; and yet a head of his whole Realme, I hope, and of all the companies thereto belonging, temporall at leaſt, and in temporalibus, euen by your owne confeſſion. Therefore an inſidell King may as well be head of the Church, as a Chriſtian King may be head ouer them, with whome he participates not in their ſinnes and vngodlineſſe. In the reſt of the words that the Adioynder quotes out of Biſhop Barlowe Sermon, it ſeemes he ſaies, that the Puritanes allow the King to be onely an honourable member of the Church. And yet the Adioynder would perſwade vs but a little before, that the Papiſts goe as farre as the Puritanes about the Supremicie, &c. Whereas his owne argument is here againſt certaine Kings, No members. Therefore no heads But the Puritans acknowledge their King a member, in the very words that he citeth out of B. Barlow, and an honourable member, that is happily Supreame. He contradicts himſelfe therefore. As for their denying him to be Gouernour, (though it appeare not in their words) yet either their meaning is, he is not to gouerne after his owne luſt and fancie, againſt the booke of God, put into his hands: or Biſhop Barlow deſcribes the Puritans by their old Problemes, which they diſclaime daily, as the Biſhop of Ely exceeding well notes. But now to come to Mr. Brightman, as I ſaid. He makes Conſtantine to be that Angell that ſtands before the altar, Apoc. 8. hauing the golden cenſer of perfumes in his hand, and caſting them vpon the prayers of the Saints and righteous, which aſcend vp before God. Would this man, thinke you, diſdaine, that Princes ſhould be interpoſers in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, or challenge the cheife conuzance and arbittement of them to thē

               § 89. Now concerning other States and Kingdomes not enlarging the Supremacie ſo farre as we doe here in England, viz.

to giue Lyceuſes, Diſpenſations, Commiſſions, Faculties, to conſecrate Biſhops, to excommunicate, to interdict, ſuſpend, cenſure, &c. Let the Reader be carefull of reading theſe laſt words as they lie in the Adioynder, with due punctation of them, or els hee may chance to fall into the Adioynders pit-fold, which will be his great pleaſure to looke on and laugh. For though it runne thus, to giue Commiſſions to conſecrate, to excommunicate, cenſure, &c. yet he meanes not, I truſt, that our Kings do either excommunicate, cenſure, or ſuſpend in their owne perſons, but giue Commiſſions to Biſhops, to conſecrate other Biſhops, and ſo perhaps to execute the other enſuing acts of cenſure there recounted, as excommunication, ſuſpenſion, &c. And yet this is not auouched out of any of our records, but onely nakedly imputed to vs by the Adioynder; which if it be true, as I confeſſe I am not 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , not ſo ſtudied in the Lawes (my profeſſion beeing cleane another waies) it is to be vnderſtood of And this is euen the worſt that can be boulted out of thoſe wordes of the B. ſo ſpightfully inſiſted vpon by the Adioynd. Numb. 67. that the Kings gouernment of the Church is externall, ſo farre forth as it requires and admitteth and authoritie For ſo farre he is from extenuating the Kings Supremacie therby, that his meaning is, We are to looke for as much helpe and aid frō him, and conſequently to acknowledge as much authoritie in him, as is humans, that is incident to the power or place of any man whatſoeuer, and therefore Supreame without queſtion in his Kingdome. Though he denies not, but the Church may ſtand without ſuch helpe or countenance of authoritie (as in the times of perſecution) God ſupporting it, &c which is moſt true. Therfore he ſaies, So fore forth as it requires, &c. patronage and Princely protection, that their acts may goe for currant and vncontemned of Chriſtian people, not but that in themſelues they are of validitie before God, out of the ſpirituall power, which he hath entruſted his Prieſts and Miniſters with, though there be no confirmation of the ſecular arme.
               § 90. Though it might be referred alſo to the commandements and iniunctions of Chriſtian Kings, whereby they vrge Clergy-men to doe their duties, if happily they be ſtacke or vnwilling of themſelues. For which cauſe Mr. Sanders ſaies, that Kings can command nothing which they may not execute, De claue Dauid. lib. 5. cap. 5. & 6. That becauſe we denie to Princes the execution of Prieſtly duties, they may take away Gouernement too, in cauſes, and ouer perſons, Eccleſiaſticall. Yet we heard S.

                  Cyrill ſpeaking plainely a little before, for Theodoſius his commanding of Biſhops, &c. altogether as Ezechias did the Leuites, who yet might not execute a Leuites charge. So Salomon ſacrificed ſaies the Scripture, that is, the Prieſts at Salomons commaundement; not as Oziah with his owne hands, nay not as Vzzah, ſo much as to handle a holy thing forbidden. And becauſe Mr. Sanders makes ſuch a piece of worke hereof, and ſaies, there is no inſtance to be giuen in all the world, of a perſon commannding that which hee may not execute (ſauing onely when there is diſparagement in the doing of it, as for a Captaine to deſcend to the meane offices of the Campe, which Plato forbids; but as for the Miniſterie, In Politico.
                   there is no diſparagement in it, no not to Kings themſelues (ſaith he) which we are contēt to admit) I will reckon therfore ſome few inſtances to choke him withal, and to defend our diſtinction between Execution and Gouernement, which is the maine thing to be heeded in the queſtion of Supremacie.  How is it els, that the Pope may command ſwords  to be drawne in caſu, and yet himſelfe may not handle the ſword, as Lib. 2. c. 11. Sand. bis hoc agnoſeit, & repetit idem c. 12. in initio. Negavimus cum Auguſtino licuiſſe Petro, &c.
                   
                  Mr. Sanders confeſſeth in this booke? Though it is next to a wonder to ſee a Temporall Prince, in his own territorie at leaſt, who at no hand may handle a ſword, or ſtrike a blow. Yet they giue the Pope this authoritie to ſet other folks ſwords a worke, not onely in his Territorie, but throughout Chriſtendome. And I might haue ſet it yet ſomewhat higher. How was the Iudge in the old Law to put to death malefactors by the appointment of the Prieſt, (as the Papiſts would haue it,) Deuter. 17. 9. who yet was not to ſtrike, (for that was the Iudges office,) if no body may preſcribe that which he may not execute? Neither let M. Sanders ſay, that to ſtrike a blow, or to ſlay a malefactour, is diſgrace or diſparagement; which is rather the ſanctifying 
                     Fatente & Tullio, Cat. 1. Non modo non contamtuarunt, ſed etiam honeſtarunt. of a good ſubiects hands, to kill a rebell (yea and that ſomtimes vniudged) if neceſſitie ſo require; to omit that this conceit driues faſt vpon Anabaptiſme, to thinke that carrying the ſword is diſparageable or diſgracefull, which the

We read in the booke of Martyrs, of a certaine Knight in Poperie, that put a Prieſt into the graue aliue, becauſe he refuſed to burie a corps that was brought to Church, where there was no mortuarie to be had: ſuch was their couetouſneſſe, Yet alas what compariſon between burying of the dead (which our Sauiour makes ſo ſleight of, Suffer the dead to bury their dead) and the adminiſtring of Chriſts Sacrament, for the ſauing of a poore ſoule from euerlaſting deſtruction? It is therefore not the vnworthineſſe of the miniſteriall duties, (as Mr. Sanders by his Syllogiſmes would faine driue vs to ſay, or elſe to let goe our diſtinction betweene Iniunction and Execution) not the baſeneſſe of our office (for we magnifie our Miniſterie, and the Angels are thought to tremble at the weight of it: Quis ad haec idoneus? ſaid he: viz. neither heauenly nor earthly abilities put in one;) but the

meere diſtance and diſunion of the two callings (I am loath to ſay repugnance, though that alſo after a ſort) which will not permit a Prince to do Prieſtly offices, though his power extend to the commaunding of them to be done; yea puniſhing and correcting if they be not done. Curſed be hee that does the Lords worke negligently, ſaid the Prophet of old. And the heathen Poet aſſumes,

               we cannot do Gods worke and the worlds too. Therefore God will haue his worke done by ſuch onely, as ſhall intend nor doe no other worke then that. For this cauſe, gouernement remaines with the King, without any entermedling in the execution of our offices; the execution is ours without any right in

                   To omit, that for ſo much as others exerciſe theſe acts in thoſe Kingdomes, though they deriue not their authoritie  ſo literally from the King, yet the Kings permiſſion is their deputation, and ſo the Supremacie ſtill remaines in himſelfe.

               The thirteenth to the ROMANES expounded by S. CHRYSOSTOME, ſo farre foorth as it concerneth the SVPREMACY OF KINGS, and the Subiection of all perſons to their authoritie, of what ſort ſoeuer; remaining in their Dominions;
               
               
                  Which I thought good to annexe here, not onely as a ſtrengthening to diuers paſſages of this Booke, and namely to the laſt of all, conſiſting in the defence of his MAIESTIES ROYALL SVPREMACIE, againſt the Adioynders peeuiſh cauills; but as an opening of the main controuerſie about the oath of Allegeance (which hath giuen the occaſion to all theſe labours, as the Powder-plot gaue iuſt cauſe to that) viz. that we are to obſerue it by the Laws of CHRIST, and his Apoſtles, towards our King and Prince, of whatſoeuer relligion, or profeſſion, they ſhall bee.
               
               
                  
                     VER. 1. Let euerie ſoule be ſubiect to the higher Powers.
                  
                     THe Apoſtle inſiſts much vpon this matter, 
                        Chryſ. Hom. 23. in 13. ad Rom. not onely in this; but in other Epiſtles, planting ſubiection in Subiects towards their Princes, as wel as in Seruants towards their Maſters. And this he does, by ſhewing that Chriſt gaue no Lawes with the

intent to ſubuert Common-wealths or States, but directed all to their better gouernement, and taught vs not to ruſh into ſuperfluous garboyles, and vnprofitable attempts. For Heare this yee Ieſuits, complainers of perſecution & moleſtation. in very truth, the traines that are laid for godly men, and the dangers that await vs for the truths ſake, they are enough of themſelues, and we ought not to augment them by ſuperfluous tribulations, contriued by our owne ill-deſeruings. Conſider alſo how ſeaſonably the Apoſtle makes his mention hereof in this place. For hee exhorts to this, when? After he had required paſſing accurateneſſe and ſtrictneſſe at their hands, after he had made them tractable both to friends and foes, both to them in proſperity, and them in aduerſitie, to them in want and them that felt no want, to all in generall; after he had ſetled a kind of life among them more fit for Angels then for men; after hee had purged choller, and rebated pride, and euery way ſmoothed ouer their diſpoſitions moſt handſomely; then, I ſay, hee brings in this exhortation. For it ſtands to reaſon, that if we may not requite them with croſſe dealing and euill turnes, that haue iniutied vs firſt, much more ought we to yeeld obedience to them that are beneficiall and kinde towards vs. But this ſtring the Apoſtle touches not vpon as yet, till towards the latter end of his exhortation. In the meane while, he ſtands onely vpon ſuch reaſons and arguments as may ſeem to claime it for a dutie at our hands. And inſinuating that he giues this precept to all, not onely to temporall men, but to Prieſts and to Monks, his very firſt words import as much, ſaying, Let euerie ſoule bee ſubiect to the higher powers, [viz.] 
                     Yet the Pope is not aboue an Apoſtle, I hope, at the higheſt. Though thou beeſt an APOSTLE, though an EVANGELIST, though a PROPHET, or whoſoeuer thou beeſt. For this ſubiection The cauſe of relligion doth not acquit frō ſubiection. is not repugnant to relligion, [whatſoeuer they talke.] Neither ſaies hee barely, Let them obey; but, let them be ſubiect. And the firſt iuſtification of this his precept, and that which worketh moſt vpon godly mindes, is becauſe God hath ſo commanded it.

                        
For there is no power (ſaith he) but from God.
                  
                  What ſayeſt thou Paul? Is euery Ruler and Magiſtrate appointed of God? I ſay not ſo (quoth he,) neither ſpeake This is againſt Vſurpers & intruders onely. I now of particular Magiſtrates, but onely of the matter of gouernement in generall. For that there ſhould be a Magiſtracy, and that ſome ſhould beare rule, & others be ſubiect, and that all things ſhould not be hurried at aduenture vp and downe, people raging like waues rolling in the broad Sea, to and fro; this, I ſay, is a worke particularly proceeding from Gods high wiſedome. And for this cauſe he ſaid not,

                     For there is no Magiſtrate but from God; but he ſpeakes of the generall, and frames his ſpeach thus, For there is no authoritie, or no power, but from God.
                     And the Powers that are, are ordained of God.
                  
                  So, when the wiſeman ſayes, [Prou. 19.] That a wife is prepared for a man of the Lord: he meanes thus, that God appointed marriage in generall, and not that hee is the author of each particular copulation between man and woman. For we ſee many that marrie nothing auſpiciouſly, many alſo that come together againſt the Lawes of marriage, and we muſt not lay the fault hereof vpon God. But that which Chriſt pronounced, Matth. 19. Hee that made them at firſt, created them male and female, and ſaid; for this ſhall a man leaue father and mother, and ſhall cleaue to his wife, this and no other did Salomon meane in that place of the Prouerbs. For, for ſo much as paritie induceth to ſtrife and diſſenſion oft-times, Gouernment is neceſſarie. God therefore hath ordained many relations of gouernements & of ſubiections, as between the man & the wife, between Paritie begets contention. the parent and the child, between the auncient and the nouice, betweene the ſeruant and the freeman, between the Magiſtrate and the ſubiect: and [laſtly alſo] betweene the Scholler and the Maſter. And why ſhouldeſt thou wonder, that it is ſo in men, when thou maieſt obſerue the ſame in the creation of thine owne body? For God hath not made

all the members of it equall between themſelues, but one meaner, another better; and this member to gouerne, and that to be gouerned. Likewiſe, a man may diſcerne the Gouernment is naturall. ſame, in the very bruit beaſts and vnreaſonable creatures. As not onely in Bees firſt, but alſo in Cranes, and in flocks or heards of wilde cattell. Neither is the Sea a ſtranger to Monarchie is naturall, that is, moſt agreeable to Nature. this good order, but euen there alſo diuers kinds of fiſhes are ranked and regimented vnder the conduct of ſome one fiſh, and ſo make their long voyages. For, want of gouernment brings inconuenience euery where, euery where confuſion [both at ſea and land]. The Apoſtle therefore hauing ſhewed of whome gouernement comes, inferres in this wiſe,
               
               
                  
                     VER. 2. Wherefore he that reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God.
                  Loe, how high he fetches this matter, and with what he feares them, and how he ſhewes that ſubiection is meere debt and dutie. For leaſt the faithfull ſhould ſay, Why Paul, 
                     The Ieſuites obiection againſt Pauls ſubiectiō, thou debaſeſt vs, and makeſt vs vile & contemptible; doeſt thou ſubiect them to ciuill Magiſtrates, that are in the way to enioy the Kingdome of heauen, and eternall ſaluation? [leaſt any one ſhould reply thus, I ſay] he ſhewes that in exhorting Anſwered by himſelfe. vs to be ſubiect to Magiſtrates, he ſubiects vs to God himſelfe, and not to men onely. For he that is ſubiect to the Magiſtrates, obeyes God therein. Neuertheleſſe the Apoſtle ſayes not in plaine tearmes, that hee that obeyeth the Magiſtrate, obeyeth God in ſo doing, but he terrifies them with the danger of the contrarie practiſe couertly inſinuated, and frames his argument much more artificially, ſaying, that he that obeyes not the Magiſtrate, confronts God, who hath ordained the Magiſtrate. And indeed this is his Subiection is dutie in the very beſt, not curteſie.
                      proiect euery where, to ſhew that we yeeld not obedience to Magiſtrates, as a matter of beneuolence, but of meere duty. For he knew that by this meanes, he ſhould the rather tole both infidell Magiſtrates to embrace relligion, and Chriſtians

to yeeld their obedience to thoſe Magiſtrates. The Apoſtles called traytors; but their doctrine refutes it, not onely their practiſe: whereas the Ieſuites both practiſe and doctrine confirmes it. For there was much bruit then, and many rumours were ſpread, as if the Apoſtles had been guilty of ſedition and treaſon, and as if all their doings, and all their ſayings, had tended but to the ſubuerſion of the Lawes, and weales-publike. When the Apoſtle therefore could ſhew them, that Chriſt their common Maſter, gaue all his followers this in charge [that they ſhould eſtabliſh Magiſtracie, and encourage to ſubiection] it was both the eaſier ſtopping of ſlanderous mouthes that A true Apoſtle need not feare to preach the myſteries of his Meſſage, before any Infidel-Gouernour: but a Ieſuite may, leaſt there be LVPVS in fabula, as they ſticke not to call him. exclaimed againſt them, as traytors to the State, and himſelfe might proceed in his courſe of preaching, and deliuering to his auditors, the other doctrines of Chriſtianity, with ſo much the more confidence and liberty. Be not therfore (ſaith he) aſhamed of this ſubiectiō 
                     [whoſoeuer thou art]. For God hath appointed it, God hath ordained it; and he is a ſharpe reuenger of them that deſpiſe it. Neither will hee content himſelfe to take a meane puniſhment, or [ſmall]

All which things the Apoſtle implying, addes thus, and ſayes,
But they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelues damnation.
                  
                  After this he ſhewes what benefit comes by preſeruing Other argumēts [ab vtili] of beeing ſubiect to Magiſtrates. obedience, as formerly he had ſhewed them the danger of reſiſting, and perſwades them by diſcourſe in this wiſe,
               
               
                  
                     VER. 3. For Magiſtrates are not a terrour too good works, but to the euill.
                  For becauſe he had terrified them, & gone deep with the The Romanes alwaies noted of pride & contumacie to Magiſtrates. Bern. & alij.

thee? will the Magiſtrate thinkeſt thou chide thee, if thou doe well? Is he a fright to them that are vertuouſly minded? Wherefore it followes,
With thou not then be afraid of the Magistrate? [or of the power?] doe that which is good, and thou ſhalt haue praiſe of the ſame.
                  
                  See wee how finely he hath made them friends? how he hath accorded the matter betweene the Magiſtrate and the Subiect? Inſtead of a terrifier, he hath brought him about now, to be a praiſer and a commender. How hath he diſperſt the former clowds, and rectified conceits that were amiſſe?

Sith therfore Euen Nero this. Harken you Ieſuites; you that think the bands of all goodneſſe are diſſolued, if an infidell Prince be but endured or obeyed. thou haſt a commender, and an aſſiſtant of him, why art thou not ſubiect to him?

Wherefore alſo he calls him, Monarchs are the Miniſters of God for our ſaluation. the Miniſter of God. Conſider, I pray thee: The Miniſter is perſwaſiue, the Magiſtrate may be coactiue, but both of them deale in the ſame matters; viz. matters of the conſcience. Quare idem alibi Chryſoſt.

For he is the Miniſter of God, a reuenger to execute wrath vpon him that doth euil.
                  
                  For leaſt hearing of puniſhments, & execution of the Sword, thou ſhouldeſt fall backe againe, through faint heart, from thy lately receiued rule of obedience, he tells thee once againe, that the Magiſtrate does no more then God giues him charge, he fulfills Gods Law, he is the Miniſter of God to puniſh euill doers. 
                        Nero neſciens ſuſtentat omnia. Wicked Magiſtrates vnwilling holde vp the ſtate. Where is the aſſiſtance that they challenge to the Pope, to ouerrule his tongue againſt his wit, leaſt he pronounce falſe, defining in his Conſiſtorie? Or what prerogatiue is that to this? For what though he doth not know himſelfe what he does? Yet God hath appointed & ſet it down to be ſo. If therefore both in puniſhing and likewiſe in rewarding, the Magiſtrate is onely the Miniſter of God, patronizing

vertue, baniſhing vice (which is the thing for certaine that God would haue done) why ſhouldſt thou conteſt with him [about ſubiection] who both brings ſuch a many bleſſings with him (as hath beene lately rehearſed) and ſtrangely promotes thine owne deſires?

                           que
                         de neceſſitate proficitur, &c. For there are diuers men, that beginning to practiſe vertue for dread of the Magiſtrate, afterward embraced it for the feare of God. For dull-witted folks are not ſo much mooued with things to come, as with matters preſent. In ſumme therefore, e The Magiſtrate prepares the ſoules of his ſubiects, ſaith S. Chryſoſt. Yet the Ieſuites ſay he muſt be no dealer in ſoule-matters. f Magiſtrates iuſtly tearmed the Miniſters of God. hee that can ſo frame and faſhion the ſoules of men [committed to his charge] what by feare on the one ſide, what by rewards on the other, that they may bee the more capable of the heauenly nurture, he may iuſtly [I trow] be called the Miniſter of God.
                  
               
               
                  
                     VER. 5. Wherefore you muſt needs be ſubiect, not onely for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.
                  What meane thoſe words, Not onely for wrath? Not only (ſaith he) becauſe thou reſiſteſt God, vnleſſe thou beeſt ſubiect, neither onely becauſe thou draweſt diuers plagues vpon thine owne head, both from God and men [as aſſuredly thou doeſt, vnles thou obey] but alſo becauſe he is thy gracious benefactour in matters of greateſt g The conſcience of a good turne, viz. receiued of God in his inſtitution of Commonwealths, is that which ſhould mooue vs to be ſubiect to the ciuil Magiſtrate, for conſcience ſake, as S. Chryſoſt. here expounds it. conſequence, hauing prouided for thy peace, and to that ende eſtabliſhed the ciuill gouernement. For infinite many bleſſings befall communities, by theſe manner of Magiſtracies. Take away them, and take away all; neither city, nor countrey, nor houſe, nor court, nor nothing els will ſtand, but all will be ouerturned, all goe to wracke; the mightier [like fiſhes] deuouring the weaker, and them that are vnable to reſiſt. So that if there were no anger, or temporall plague, following the diſobedient, neuertheles thou oughteſt to be ſubiect, euen ſo; I meane, leaſt thou ſhouldeſt ſeeme rude and vngratefull to thy benefactour. [The Apoſtle proceedes,]
               
               
                  
                  
                     VER. 6. For, for this cauſe (quoth he) you pay tribute alſo: for they are Gods miniſters, attending continually vpon this very thing.
                  The Apoſtle here, omitting the mention of diuerſe other more particular benefits, which accrew to common-wealths, from their rulers and gouernours, as orderlineſſe, peaceableneſſe, and alſo thoſe other ſeruices, which both of pike and penne, peace and warre, they continually attend for the good of the whole, demonſtrates all by this one thing. For, ſaith he, thy ſelfe beareſt him witneſſe, that thou receiueſt benefit by him, in ſo much as thou art content to pay him wages. See the wiſedome and prudence of the Apoſtle. For whereas their taxes were ſo tedious, and intolerable to them, as they were ſtartled with the very mention of them, he brings them both for an argument of his cauſe in hand, and a demonſtration of their wiſdome, ready to yeeld afore he perſwade, [viz. as conuinced by their own voluntarie practiſe.] For why, quoth he, pay we tribute to the King, what is our ſcope, what our drift? Doe wee not pay it him as the wages of his carefulnes ouer vs, watching for vs, & protecting vs [with all his might?] Whereas certenly we would not haue paid thē this fee from the beginning, had we not knowne that we were gainers by their gouernment ouer vs, [and receiued benefit.] But therefore it ſeemed good to our aunceſtors long agoe, and enacted it was by commō conſent, that we ſhould ſupply the neceſſities of Kings with our purſes, becauſe neglecting their own matters, they mind the publike, and employ all their leaſure and time, to ſuch ende, as may be moſt for the preſeruation of our particular eſtates. Hauing thus then argued from matter of commoditie, he brings backe his ſpeach againe to the former head (for this was the way, to worke moſt vpon the Chriſtians, and their conſciences) and againe he ſhewes them, that this is alſo well pleaſing to almighty God; and in that he concludes his exhortation, ſaying, For

they are the Miniſters of God. And yet to note vnto vs their continuall trauell and penſiueneſſe for our ſakes, he addes moreouer,
attending continually vpon this very thing.
                  
                  For this is their life, this their occupation, that thou [euen thou] maieſt liue and die in peace. Wherefore in another Epiſtle, he not onely exhorteth vs to bee ſubiect to Magiſtrates, but alſo to pray for them. And yet there alſo he inſinuates the common benefit that all men receiue by them, in that he concludes thus, that we may liue a quiet and a peaceable 
                     2. Tim. 2. 1, 3. &c. 
                     life. For they aduantage vs not a little towards the conſtant eſtabliſhment of our eſtates, in ſo much as they prouide furniture for the common defence, repulſe enemies, ſuppreſſe mutinies, and decide and determine ciuill controuerſies. For neuer tell me, that this or that man abuſes his Diſpoſſeſſion follows not frō abuſe of place. place, but conſider the beautie of this diuine ordinance, and thou ſhalt quickely eſpie the wonderfull wiſedome of the prime ordainer of all theſe things.
               
               
                  
                     VER. 7. Feeld therefore to all men their dues, tribute to whome tribute is due; cuſtome to whom cuſtome, feare to whom feare, honour to whom honour [belongeth.] 8. Owe nothing to any man, but to loue one another, &c.
                  Still he inſiſts vpon the ſame point, and bids vs not onely yeeld them money and coyne [that haue the gouernment of vs] but alſo honour and feare. But how hangs this together, that hauing ſaid before, Wouldſt thou not feare the power? doe that which is good; here he ſayes, yeeld feare to whom feare belongeth? I anſwer in one word; He meanes the feare of diſpleaſing, or the carefull and induſtrious feare, not that which ariſeth out of a bad conſcience, which in the former words he labours to preuent.

For if S. Paul gaue theſe Lawes, when the Emperours were Pagans, how much more ſhould we obſerue them, now they be Chriſtians? And if thou ſaieſt, that thou diſpenfeſt greater matters, then hee, [ſuppoſe the word and the Sacraments, or other Prieſtly functions] know thou, that thy time is not yet come. Thou art a Hora tua nondum venit. The Prieſts Su premacie, is in altero ſaeculo. ſtranger and a pilgrime for the preſent. The time ſhall be, when thou ſhalt appeare more glorious then they all. In the meane while, thy life is hidde with Chriſt in God. When Chriſt ſhall appeare, then ſhalt thou alſo appeare with him in glorie. Seek not therefore thou thy recompence in this tranſitorie life. But although thou beeſt to appeare before the Magiſtrate perforce, and that with great horror, and dread, and appallment of all ſides, yet think it no diſparagement to thy high nobilitie. For God will haue it ſo, and it is his pleaſure, that the Magiſtrate of his own conſtituting, ſhould be alſo inueſted with his proper rights and honours. Markeſt thou alſo another thing that enſues hereof? When an honeſt man like thy ſelfe, and guiltie of no crime, ſhall appeare before the Magiſtrate, humbly, and ſubmiſſiuely; much more will the malefactor ſtand in awe of authoritie, and thou by this ſhalt winne credit and reputation to thy ſelfe.

               101. The Papiſts faile in their probations by the Fathers touching

prayer to Saints, for all their iolly crakes. More good Latine of the Adioynders. p. 321
               102. The Adioynders water will ſeeth no beefe. He ſhould haue teſtimonies enough (he ſaies) for praying to Saints, out of the Fathers writings, but that in ſuch and ſuch ages very few Fathers wrote at all. p. 322
               103. The ſigne of the Croſſe hath antiquitie to commend it, beſides authoritie to commaund it: Praying to Saints hath neither the one to be reſpected, nor the other to be obeyed. p. 323

Auſten, when he charges vpon Iulian, with the authoritie of ſixe Biſhops, as ſufficient to conuict him. Els we know ſixe Biſhops are nothing to weigh with the world of faithfull beſides. Originall ſinne plaine by Scripture, though the Adioynder ſtone-blind cannot ſee it. p. 328. & 329.

The Biſhops quotation of Athanaſius moſt vpright, and moſt authenticall, though it pleaſe Mr. Adioynder, either of blindnes, or boldnes, to denie that there is any ſuch text in the booke. By occaſion of ſearch, not onely that, but ſeuen more places of Athanaſius are alleadged, all of them neere hand, and to the ſame effect, viz. that God onely is to be adored, and prayed vnto, not Creatures. p. 342. & 343
            
            
               CHAP. 9.
               114. THe Biſhop changes wordes, without changing the queſtion, giuing more light to it. He is not tied to tearmes, as the Adioynder and they that haue no great ſtore of Latine beforehand.

               117. Adoration of relliques. The Biſhop conſtant to the queſtion, though they cauill him for the cōtrarie. Yea, ſo conſtant, that they carpe him for his very conſtancie to the Kings Apologie, with the ſame breath. p. 350. & 351

120. The very Popiſh authors will not permit vs to worſhip Angells, ſince the Incarnation of Chriſt. So as the Adioynder pleading for it, ſhewes who is the Iew, and the digger vp of ceremonies, (like Sara vnder the Oke:) as he reniles the Biſhop, but moſt ſenſeleſly, euery where. p. 353
               121. No third kind of adoration. Therefore no relligious to creatures. ibid. & p. 354

               124. Awodden reaſon and a wicked yeelded by the Adioynder, why it is called relligious worſhip, viz. becauſe done to relligious perſons, (But by that reaſon God himſelfe ſhould haue no part in it, who beares relligion to none. The Saints ſo let in, as God himſelfe is ſhut out by our deuout Ieſuits.) p. 359. & 360

               129. Lingere pulverem is the ſame in effect with lambere lignum. They both ſignifie humiliation with reuerence. Saue that lingere pulverem may ſeeme to beſeeme Chriſtians better. The ſmaller errour therefore to put that for the other. S. Hieromes Epiſtle full of figuratiue ſpeeches, which was the onely intent of the Reuerend Biſhop in that place, and is iuſtified abundantly. p. 363. & 364

               132. Relligious adoration graunted and not graunted to Creatures by S. Auſten: not fauouring the Papiſts, but becauſe the word relligious is equiuocall. p. 369
               133. S. Ambroſe is not for worſhipping the Croſſe relligiouſly. In Kings it is worſhipped ciuilly, as Kings themſelues are: yet but per accidens onely. Els Helenaes practiſe is againſt it, recorded and explained by S. Ambroſe. Howbeit the conſideration of it may [happily] excite vs by way of remembrance to worſhip CHRISTRELLIGIOVSLY, as the Author of our redemption. p. 373
               134. The croſſe is not the croſſe, but Chriſts ſuffering to S. Hierome, by his owne explication. p. 374
               135. The Biſhop anſwered all that was worth the anſwering, of the Cardinalls. The Adioynders ſtout arguing from Adam to Chriſt, for inherent righteouſnes and haſtie perfection. p. 375. ad 378.
               136. The Adioynder tangled in his owne threads. Perfect remiſſion of ſinne, without perfect exhauſting of corruptions. The places of Eſay and other ſcriptures ſo to be vnderſtood. p. 378. ad 381.
               137. The Adioynder faultie of that which he finds fault with in the Biſhop, though moſt faultleſſe, as appeareth. Kings graunts are not to be interpreted againſt themſelues. Conſtantine Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum to Euſebius. Neither King, nor Count, are precluded from Councells, by auncient practiſe. p. 381. 382. 383.
               138. S. Auſten hath but heare-ſay. Apparition prooues not inuocation. (Yet Athanaſ. ad Antioch. (the Adioynders owne author) againſt apparition of ſoules departed, for great reaſons. Quaeſt. 13.) No truſting to Saints departed, by S. Auſtens

Shee is inferiour to Angells by Epiphanius account of her. Like Thecla, or like Iohn, and no better. Epiphanius calls for Scripture, to be guided in this queſtion.

               157. The Sacrament to be worſhipped, neither during the act, nor yet after celebration. And yet Chriſt, in it. Caluin ſober and deliberate in that point. The Biſhop diſſents not from the reſt of our Diuines, about the worſhipping of Chriſt, and the rather in his Sacrament. à pag. 421. ad 425
               158. Chriſt is to bee worſhipt with the Sacrament, in a good ſenſe; The Sacrament not in any ſenſe with Chriſt. The Adioynder throwes dirt, but it will not ſticke. pag. 425. & 426.
               159. About the Reward, and againſt the Merit of good works. The reuerend Biſhop farre from praeuaricating. Their rage againſt him ſhewes his integrity and ſincerity in the cauſe. They that hold of merit, hold of [Iudas] Iſcariot, by S. Hieromes Etymologie of the name; to whome the Scripture allots

               160. God is honoured in his ſeruants, if they be honoured intra praeſcriptum. Els not honoured, but diſhonoured in them. The Adioynder is earneſt for his kiſſing-deuotion; and namely, towards Relliques (where as kiſſing Baal is worſhipping of Baal, in the language of the holy Ghoſt, 1. Reg. 19. 18.) Origen againſt this fancie: Chriſts ſpouſe muſt not be too franke in entertaining his mates, though we ſhould allow him ſodales, Cant. 1. 7.
