            and can not skyll of eloquence
            Yet wyll I do my diligence
            To say sumthing or I go hence
            wherin I may demonstrate
            the figure gesture and estate
            Of one that is a curate
            that harde is and endurate
            and ernest in the cause
            Of piuish popish lawes
            that are not worth two strawes
            Except it be with dawes
            that knoweth not good from euels
            Nor Gods worde from the Deuels
            Nor wyll in no wise heare
            the worde of god so cleare
            but popishnes vpreare
            and make the pope Gods peare
            and so them selues they lade
            wyth bables that he made
            and styll wyll holde his trade
            No man can them perswade
            and yet I dare say
            ther is no day
            but that they may
            Heare sincerily
            and right truly

            And ye wyll tell me newes.
            For if he ons begyn

            beyond all measure ye may me beleue
            His learning is exceding
            ye may know by his reading
            yet could a cobblers boy him tell
            That he red a wrong gospell,
            wherfore in dede he serued him well
            He turned himselfe as round as a bell
            And with loud voyce began to call
            Is there no constable among you all,
            to take this knaue yt doth me troble?
            with that all was on a hubble shubble

            and ketching and catching
            and so the pore ladde

            He was worthy no lesse
            for vexing with his pertnesse
            a gemman going to Messe,

            To shew a gemman such a toy?
            ¶but if it were wel wayde

            and iudgement in the veritie
            among honest folke to be
            A curate rather then he.
