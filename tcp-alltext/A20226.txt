                   euery thing: and that wee may knew what we ſay, I purpoſe chiefly to hadle theſe two points.
               Firſt that Chriſt the Sonne of G
                     ••
                   hath the ſelfe ſame prouidence, the God the Father hath: Secondly, t

not recite all that may be ſaid touching his matter, but only touch ſome chiefe pointes ſummarily, which may helpe 
                     •
                  n the better to vnderſtand the large and learned tracts, that many notable 
                     •
                  en haue written hereof. For the firſt:
            
            
               That Chriſt the Sonne of GOD doth gouern
                     •
                   all things as well as God the Father, is prooued by reaſon, example, and authoritie.
               BY reaſon; if God by his wiſdome made the world: that is, if that the eternall wiſdome of God, which is his word, the euerlaſting Sonne of God, was preſent with God, when he made the worlde: he is alſo with him in gouerning the world: but hée was with God when he made the world, therefore he is with him in gouerning of it.
               The equity of the firſt propoſition is

grounded vpon moſt ſtrong reaſon:
               For as God created the world by his wiſdome, ſo it is not to be beléeued, that God gouerneth the world without his wiſdome, otherwiſe hée ſhould gouerne by chance.
               The ſecond propoſition is pr
                     ••
                  ed by the teſtimony of the Apoſtle. Heb. 1. by whom alſo he made the worlds.
               
               By example, Gen. 48. verſ. 13. 14. 15. Then tooke Ioſeph them both, Ephrain
                        •
                      in his right hand towards Iſraels left hand, Manaſſeth in his left hand toward Iſraels right hand, ſo hee brought them vnto him.
               
               But Iſraell ſtretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraims head which was the younger, and his left hand vpon Manaſſehs head (directing his hands on purpoſe) for Manaſſeh was the elder.
               Alſo hee bleſſed Ioſeph, and ſaid the GOD before whom my Fathers Abraham & Iſack did walke, the God which hath fed me al my life lōgvnto this day▪
               
               In which words Iacob acknowle
                     •
                  
                  geth Gods prouidence to ſtretch particular men, euen to himſelfe.
               
                  Then it followeth as verſ: 5. 26. The Angell which hath deliuered me from 
                        •
                     ll euill, bleſſe the children, and let my name bee named vpon them, and the name of my Fathers Abraham, and Izacke, that they may grow as fiſh, into 
                        •
                      multitude in midſt of the earth. In theſe words, the holy Patriarke Iacob giueth that particular prouidence to y• Angell, which in the former verſe hée had giuen to God: And that by the 
                     •
                  ame of Angell he vnderſtandeth no treature, is hereby proued, in that hée 
                     •
                  ffirmeth, that this angel had power to 
                     ••
                  eſſe: ſaying to him, Bleſſe the children: Hée then is the angell, whom Iacob was wont to call, the angell of the Lord, that is the Sonne of God.
               Therefore in this place Iacob attributeth a prouidence ouer al things and perſones, to the angell: that is the Sonne of God, as well as to God the Father.
               By authority Iohn 5. ver. 17. My Father worketh and I worke: This works that Chriſt ſpeaketh of, is not to be vn
                  
                     •
                  erſtood of the creation onely, but alſo of the gouerning of al things created.
               
                  For this particle (hitherto) ſheweth that he ment not onely that firſt worke of his in creating all things with his Father, but alſo another worke, which he daily excerciſeth, which cannot bée vnderſtood of any other then of gouerning all things with his Father.
               But here we muſt obſerue this rule that the workes of the Trinity are vndeuided.
               Therefore that which is the Fathers worke is the worke alſo of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt.
               That the Sonne of GOD doth the ſame workes that the Father doth, is already prooued: the ſame is to be affirmed alſo of the holy Ghoſt, by the warrant of Gods word, as by that I read in the 139. Pſame Whether ſhal I goe from the Spirit? or whether ſhall I flie from thy preſence? If aſcende into Heauen, thou art there: If I lie downe in hell thou art there: let mee take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the vttermoſt partes of the Sea, yet thether ſhall thine hand lead mee, and thy right hand hold mee: Thus is the firſt point brieſly▪ prooued, that

Chriſt the Sonne of God, and the holy Ghoſt, do gouerne all things as wel as God the Father.
               Now to the ſecond: that God by his prouidence gouerneth all and euery thing.
               There are very many that can willingly graunt, that God by his prouidence gouerneth all things in general, but that euery particularthing is ruled by the ſame, they deny: with theſe men therefore I minde to deale ſome what largely, though not ſo learnedly, as the cauſe requireth: (& who is able to handle it worthily?) Philoſophers haue in this point had ſundry opinions: Epicurus ſaid, that all things were ruled by chance and fortune, and that God liued idelly, and at eaſe in the Heauens: which opinion, as impious, all men in wordes condemne, and yet ſo we liue that our liues are euident proofes againſt vs, that in heart and ſoule wée imbrace it.
               For ſurely if we thought any better of GOD then Epicurus did, wée would not walk ſo directly in Epicurus pathes as we do, or liue ſo licentiouſly

                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
as though God regarded vs not.
               The Periapatetickes, and other ſort of Philoſophers, broched another opinion, teaching that thoſe things which are aboue the Heauens, are mooued, guided and gouerned by God himſelf: but thoſe things that are vnder the circle of the Moone, are gouerned partly by chance and fortune, partly by the counſailes and deuiſes of men, & partly by a brutiſh▪ or ſenceles force of nature.
               There is a third opinion of the Stoicks, which is that all things are ruled by fate or deſtiny, that is by a ſecret order and linke of cauſes: in which chaine, all things are ſo ſurely tied, that both God himſelfe and man are ſtraighted within thoſe bounds.
               This was a very dainty opinion in the iudgement of the Poets: who to excuſe the weakenes of their God Iupiter, fained that he wept, for that he was ſo hindered by the force of deſtiny, that he could not ſet Sarpedo at liberty.
               The fourth opinion is Platoes, who graunteth that God by his prouidence ruleth all things in generall, which afterward God cōmiteth to petty Gods,

halfe Gods, and diuells, who haue the charge and care of particular things: From theſe foure opinions ſpring all other whatſoeuer, touching Gods prouidence: and there is no one opinion, which may not eaſily be reduced to one of theſe.
               But ſome of vs (euen of vs Chriſtians) flying one danger, run into another: & for that they dare not deny that God by his prouidēce ruleth al things, yet will they not graunt, that by it, hée gouerneth euery particular thing, leaſt they ſhould thereby be driuen (as they think) to ſome abſurdities: thus whilſt they would auoide abſurditie, they commit impiety and fal away from the truth moſt dangerouſly: But farre bee this frō your heart (Right worſhipful) and that it may neuer poſſeſſe you: auoid the cauſe that worketh it in them, which is ignorance of the word of God: and for that God in great mercy hath kindled in your heart a deſire of knowledge, quench not that godly deſire, in you, but purſue hotly with hearty and feruent prayer, after knowledge, and you ſhall finde it: and if you ſhall finde

it, you ſhal
                     •
                  certainely know▪ that there will no abſurdity be inforced vpon any doctrine grounded vpon Gods word, & that you néed not feare this doctrine, as they do: I wil firſt diſcourſe breifly of the truth of it, and wil proue, that God gouerneth by his prouidence al things generally, and euery particular thing particularly: then wil I anſwere to al thoſe chiefe obiections which are brought againſt it, and by which ſome vaine men think to make the doctrine abſurde. To the firſt:
               For that this argument hath béene diuerſly handled, and men haue béene very curious in diſcourſing thereof: eſpetially ſince what way ſoeuer they winde themſelues, many abſurdities doe ſéeme to follow them: it wil be beſt I thinke for me to kéepe me in the high beaten way, leaſt ſéeking by-wayes, I wander out of the way: I meane to diſcourſe ſo of this doctrine, as I am taught in the word of God▪ & then diligently to remooue al thoſe things whatſoeuer they be not beſéeming the moſt pure nature of God, which in the iudgmēt of man, ſhal ſéeme hereof to follow.
               
                  But if my ignorance were ſo great, that I could not remooue theſe inconueniences: yet notwithſtanding, are you & all Chriſtians bound to receiue with all humilitie this true doctrine: & to blame me, not the doctrine, if I be not able to cleare it o
                     •
                   
                  
                     ••
                  l thoſe things, which in the iudgement of man may ſéeme abſurd: And although it is not my purpoſe, to examine all, that Philoſophers & others ſay againſt the gouerning of euery thing by the prouidenc
                     •
                   of God, yet in my minde, all that they cā ſay againſt it, may by this one argument be eaſily ouerthrowne. If he be a God (which they all confeſſe, & though they would deny it, yet may it eaſily bée prooued againſt them) he is a moſt perfect thing: but y• which is moſt perfect hath nothing perfecter then it ſelfe, neither can we imagine any thing to be more perfect, then that which of it ſelfe is truly & abſolutely moſt perfect: therfore there is nothing▪ neither can we imagine any thing to be more perfect then God: herevpon I infer, if God did not gouerne al things in general, & euerie thing in particular, we might well

imagine that there was ſome-thing more perfect then God: euen ſuch a deity, which had charge and care of euery particular thing: but it is ſhewed y• no ſuch deity or Godhead cā be imagined.
               It is falſe therefore, that they herevpon would infe
                     〈…〉
                   that God by his prouidence ruleth no
                     •
                   euery particuler thing & the contrary is true, which we teach: for elſe ſurely that God, which they dreame of to liue idly, and at caſe, & to haue no care of any thing, as they babble, is not in truth a God, but as Tully ſomtime ſaid of their maiſter Epicurus ſo ſay I of them, that they in words acknowledge a God, but in truth deny y• there is any. But leauing Philoſophers let vs ſée what the Scripture teacheth vs: the firſt place I will vſe for y• proofe of this doctrine, I take out of the Epiſtle to the Hebrues the 1. Chapt. verſe. 3. where it is ſaid of the ſonne of God, that Hee beareth vp, that is, mooueth and gouerneth all things by his mightie worde: hee that graunteth that he ruleth al things, excepteth no one thing from his gouernment: We may then well conclude out of this place of

God, that God gouerneth all, and euerie thing.
               But leaſt I ſhould leaue any ſtarting hole for the aduerſary to winde out at, let vs further ſée what the Scriptur
                     •
                   teacheth vs of the gouerning of euery particular thing by Gods prouidence.
               Neither will I heape vp many places, but content my ſelfe with a fewe examples, out of which the truth of this doctrine may be gathered.
               And thus I do endeuour to prooue it briefly: All the creatures of God are either indued with y• gift of frée choiſe, or elſe want this liberty of choiſe: they that haue it, are Angels, both good and euill, and men alſo both good and euill: they that want this liberty of choyſe, are all other liuing things created by God, & alſo thoſe his creatures, which haue no life: and yet of all theſe creatures, God hath a ſpeciall care, ſo as he diſpoſeth of euery one of them according to his pleaſure.
               The booke of Iob, and the Pſalmes, do very often handle this argument, ſo that if I ſhould gather out of them all their proofes, I ſhould write out almoſt

their whole bookes: yet ſome I will bring, and leaue the reſt for you to gather, hoping it wil be a means to bring you to the often reading of them.
               In the 147. Pſalme the Prophet ſaith thus of God, hat he couereth the Heauen with cloudes, and prepareth raine for the earth, and maketh the graſſe to grow vppon the Mountaines▪
                   But the cloudes, the raine, and the graſſe are things without ſoule & life, and yet by his wonderfull prouidence he driueth, and ruleth at his pleaſure the cloudes in the ayre: he ſendeth the raine downe vpon the earth, and he maketh the graſſe to grow: In the 148. Pſalme the Prophet ſaith, that fire and haile, ſnow, and vapours, ſtormie windes doe execute his worde, and what is it to execute the word of God, but to bee ruled and gouerned by his word? it is to be at his beck and pleaſure: Againe, in the 135.

                   prouidence.
               Of the Angels, which I placed at the firſt amongſt theſe creatures, that haue the liberty of choice, I wil write now the leſſe, hoping that I ſhal haue this backe againe to view, poliſh, and inlarge: but their name teacheth vs that they are ruled by God him ſelfe, for they are called Angeli Angels, that is, meſſengers ſent from God: and in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes are called the miniſters, and ſeruants of God.
               
               Thus much for the firſt part, that is for the truth of this doctrine, that God by his prouidēce ruled al things in general, and euery particular thing in particular.
               Now I come to that 
                     •
                   promiſed to

handle in the 
                     〈◊〉
                   place, namely to the vnfolding and anſwering of thoſe arguments which are made againſt this doctrine. The firſt argument they make is this: God cannot gouern all things generally, and euery creature and action without exceeding toile and griefe of mind: But it agréeeth with the nature of God, that hee reſt in quiet & be free from all labors: Therefore God doth not gouerne all and euery particular thing.
               To this argument drawne thus from the nature of God, I anſwere, that their firſt propoſition is falſe, which is that God cannot gouerne all things generally and particularly without exceeding toile, and griefe of minde: but for that I will not only deny it as falſe, but ſhew the reaſons that m
                     ••
                  ue me ſo to do, you muſt know that there are diuers kinds of actions, 
                     •
                  ome are naturall, ſome are violent, other ſome meane: that is neither altogether natural, nor altogether violent: natural actions are they that do ſlow from the principles of nature it ſelfe, without any helpe elſewhere: ſuch are

the round motions of the heauens, th
                     •
                   flowing and ebbing of the Sea, th
                     ••
                   light things do of their natural lightneſſe mount vpward, heau
                     •
                   things all downeward, that we breath 
                     •
                  nd ſuch like: theſe actions are done without any labor, becauſe they moue of themſelu
                     •
                  s without any other helpe: Other actions there are, which are done by, force, and therefore are called violent▪ as by force to make a ſtone mount vpward, whoſe nature is to fall downeward▪ And ſuch like violent actions, which cannot long laſt as Ariſtotle 
                  
                     •
                  eacheth, becauſe they are done with force. There is another ſort of actions which I called meane, whoſe beginnings are of nature, but yet they cannot bée done vnleſſe they bee helped by ſome other meanes, as to eate, to drinke, to walke, and ſuch like. But now that, that God doth, hée doth without labour, becauſe 
                     •••
                   he doth it naturally, and therefore moſt 
                     •
                  reely: againe, there is no force that can compell GOD, and therefore hee worketh of himſelfe freely, and without any compulſion:

neither is he trobled with griefes, but gouerneth all things according to the rule of his will: neither is there any thing more agréeable to the nature of God, then to gouerne, and preſerue the whole worlde, euen with the word of his power.
               A ſecond argument of theirs is this, It is an vnméete thing for God, and cleane repugnant to his nature, to entermeddle in filthy, and vncleane matters: but he cannot gouern euery ſeueral creature, and their actions, but he muſt entermeddle with many vncleane and filthy matters▪ therefore he doth not gouerne them.
               I deny the ſecond propoſition, which is, that God cannot gouerne euery ſeueral creature & their actions, but he muſt mingle himſelfe with many vncleane, and filthy matters: For that amongſt the creatures, and their actions, there are many vnclean things: this conſequence, though it be the ground of the propoſition is falſe, for although the power of God is in all his creatures, & ruleth all, yet doth it not therefore follow, that the nature

of God doth entermeddle with th
                     •
                   
                  
                     ••
                  
                  pure actions of his creatures, which may be made plaine by this ſimilitude: the Sunne of all viſible creatures moſt excellent (man onely excepted (doth moſt ſet forth the glory of God: it doth ſhine in euery place, ſo that it ſhineth often vpon the dunghil, and though the beames thereof do heate the dunghill, as they do all other places, and things which they pierce: Yet for all that the Sunne is not polluted with the defilements and vncleaneſſe of it, neither doth the ſubſtance of the beames of the Sunne mingle it ſelfe with thoſe things which it pierceth.
               When one laide this in Diogenes his diſh▪ that he went into a ſtewes or brothel-houſe, why ſaith he the Sunne commeth thither alſo, and yet is not defiled therewith: thereby ſhewing, yt a wiſe & godly man though he enter into vncleane and filthy places, and come into the company of filthie perſons, doth not forthwith

                   himſelfe to their filthines, neither is infected with their vices: If therefore this Philoſopher could enter into the ſtewes, and

come forth againe vnſpotted with their vncleaneſſe, ſo that their filthineſſe could not faſten vpon him: much leſſe is God (whoſe nature is moſt pure and ſimple in gouerning of his creatures) infected with their filthineſſe. There is a third obiection, which they thus frame: Euery wiſe and good gouernour, vnleſſe hee bee greatly hindred; bringeth his worke that hée fram
                     •
                  th, and that thing that he ruleth to a good; perfect and wiſhed end: This may be prooued by many examples, as by the example of a ſkilfull Pilot, who directeth & bringeth his ſhip to the purpoſed hauen, and ſuch like: but nothing can let God from perfecting his workes, & yet many of his creatures, as many monſters, mad men, lame, are imperfect. Therefore God ruleth not euery generation and conception: To vnloſe this knot wée muſt remember this diſ▪tinction of order: there are two ſorts of orders or courſes ye God taketh in gouerning all things: the one of them we may call ordinary▪ which God doth often vſe, the other extraordinary with which order thogh we be not acquainted,

yet doth God him-ſelfe know the cauſe why he ſo worketh: & yet of this may we not conclude, that God in his workes is contrary to himſelfe: for if ſo vs there appeare ſome diuerſity and difference in the gouernment of all things by God, certainely that difference is not of Gods rule, but of the vnſtable iudgement of our troubled minds: for Gods workes are not to be balanced by our iudgements, which are deceiueable, and for the moſt part vntrue: Auguſtine propoſed the example of two children, one of which is dutiful and louing to his father, the other is a wicked ſtubborne child: both their fathers are deadly ſick, the good childe praieth earneſtly vnto God▪ to deliuer his father from his ſicknes: y• graceles graft thinketh euery houre twenty vntill his father be breathleſſe: both their fathers died & that according to Gods appointment and direction.
               But now that childe that prayed for the prolonging of his fathers life highly pleaſed GOD: and yet it pleaſed not GOD, that his father ſhould liue any longer: And againe,

that childe that longed for his fathers death, as highly di

                     •
                   thus ſaith God of him by the Proph
                     •
                   in that place: O Aſhur the rod of 
                        •
                      wrath and the ſtaffe in their hands my indignation: I will ſend him t

                  diſſembling nation, and I will giue him a charge againſt the people of my wrath, to take the ſpoyle, and to take the prey, and to treade them vnderfoote like the mire of the ſtreete. But hee thinketh not ſo, neither doth his heart eſteeme it ſo: and ſo forth. And a little after, thus ſaith God by the Prophet of him: But when the Lord hath accompliſhed all his worke vppon Mount Sion, and Ieruſalem, I will viſit the fruite of the proude heart of the King of Aſhur, and his glorious and proude lookes, Becauſe he ſaid, by the power of myne owne hand haue I done it, and by my wiſdome becauſe I am wiſe: And a little after this, thus ſaith the Prophet, ſhal the axe boaſte it ſelfe againſt him that heweth therewith? If Pompey had looked on this example, thus laide forth by the Prophet, hée might haue b
                     •
                  ne better occupied & inſtructed then hée was by his toring with Cratippus: And this would haue taught him, that though the Lord ſuffereth tyrants to bée for a time a plague to an
                     •
                   natiō, yet in his appointed time he ſuffereth them to bée puniſhed

by other tirants, & to haue the ſame meaſure that they meaſured vnto others: Now if we compare Sennacherib, and Pompey that gloried in this title The greate: which name Silla gaue him for his victories: we ſhall finde many things alike in their hiſtories. Both of them was an axe in the hand of God to ſtrike the people of the Eaſt: Both of them deſtroyed Paleſtina, and afflicted the people of God: Sennachetib beſieged Jeruſalem, Pompey tooke it, the Aſſirian was put to flight by an Angel and was ſlaine in his Temple, that is in his Sanctuarr, by his owne Sonnes: Pompey was put to flight by Caeſar▪
                   and flying to Ptolomy King of Egipt, whoſe father being diſpoſſeſſed of his kingdome, he had reſtored again to his crowne, and therefore Ptolomy ſhould haue béene as a ſonne vnto Pompey, was there in Egipt with him miſerably ſlaine. So vnſearchable are the waies of Gods iudgements: for that which Michah ſpeaketh of the Caldeans in the 4. chap. of his propheſte: (They know not the thought
                        •
                      of the Lord, they vnderſtand
                  
                  not his councell; therefore they ſhall bee thraſhed as ſheaues is the barne, (may be ſpoken of all theſe Gyants and proude tyrants, who for that they knowt not the counſaile of the Lord, ſhall in his apointed time beare the puniſhment of their pride: Neither doth the holy Ghoſt teach vs, that the wicked only are puniſhed, but that the church of God is alſo afflicted though for another end and purpoſe: And there may many reaſons bee brought, to ſhew why the church of God is ſubiect to ſo many calamities, but I will at this time alleadge onely thrée, by which as by many other wee may know, that the Lord in truth and iudgement, doth excerciſe his church with afflictions. The firſt is y• ſo long as we carry about with vs this burthen of corruption, we are not onely ſubiect to ſinne, but do continually by ſinning prouoke the Lord to deale in iuſtice with vs: And therefore it is agréeable to the iuſtice of GOD, that wée bee chaſtned of the Lord with a fatherly rod, which may keepe vs in obedience: Yea wee muſt all

ſay with Ieremy in the third chapter of his Lamentations, verſe 22. It is the Lords mercies, that wee are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fayle not.
               
               My ſecond reaſon is this: It is beſt for vs to bée humbled vnder the mighty hand of God: for wée know how fierce and haughty minded we are by nature, ſo that it is neceſſary for vs, that God keepe vs vnder his ſchooling, and ſo haue vs in ſome awe: therfore Dauid ſaith in the 1. 19. Pſal. ver: 67. Before I was afflicted I went aſtrav: but now I keepe thy word, & ver: 71. It is good for me that I haue beene afflicted, that I may learne thy ſtatutes. The third reaſon is deliuered by Paul in his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians the 11. Chapter, verſ. 32. Whē we are iudged wee are chaſtned of the Lord, becauſe wee would not bee condemned with the world: Therefore let vs conclude this whole diſcourſe with Moſes thus: The iudgements of the Lord are true and righteous, neither let vs meaſure them according to our owne conceit & iudgements which
                  
                  are very deceiueable, but let vs know that the Godly are puniſhed for their ſinnes they dayly commit, that they may be humbled, and that they periſh not with the wicked: but God in puniſhing the wicked, doth ſhew & open the treaſures of his long ſufferance, patience and iuſtice: but when he afflicteth vs, hée maketh vs like to his owne Sonne Chriſt, and ſtirreth vp in vs an earneſt deſire to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt.
               Let vs in the meane time giue our ſelues to harty and earneſt prayers, praying continually with the Saints of God.
               Come Lord IESVS, yea come quickly,
               Amen▪ Amen.
